5
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:50,910
Yummy! Let's eat.

6
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,040
<i>My uvula!</i>

7
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,450
Asshole!

8
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,850
Go, go, go!

9
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,410
<i>Got you!</i>

10
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,750
I hit it! Pochi! Fetch!

11
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,720
<i>Around then I started to wonder:</i>
<i>What makes a happy family?</i>

12
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,640
<i>We say 'family',</i>
<i>but we're all individuals.</i>

13
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,820
<i>With our own dreams and problems.</i>

14
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,080
<i>It's said that nature</i>
<i>and nurture influence how we grow up.</i>

15
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,330
<i>With my family,</i>
<i>I know I'll grow up to be really cool.</i>

16
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,930
- You made fun of my divorce.
- Did not.

17
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,720
- You did, just now.
- Did not.

18
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,560
- Did so.
- Don't push!

19
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,690
<i>Grandpa was a department store</i>
<i>shoe salesman.</i>

20
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,270
<i>Working hard, planning his retirement.</i>

21
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,980
Stop it, you two! Act your age!

22
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,700
<i>Then, just like that, he was laid off.</i>

23
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,410
<i>When he was really down,</i>
<i>someone told him,</i>

24
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,200
<i>"They're going to build a major road.</i>

25
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,660
<i>When it's done,</i>
<i>tourists will flock here!"</i>

26
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,750
<i>Sold on the idea, he bought this place.</i>

27
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,960
<i>And practically forced us all</i>
<i>to run it as a guesthouse.</i>

28
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,590
Hey!

29
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,970
<i>He and Grandma Terue</i>
<i>met and married at work.</i>

30
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,350
<i>Sometimes, for the sake</i>
<i>of her husband or children,</i>

31
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,770
<i>an ordinary housewife can do</i>
<i>the most unexpected things.</i>

32
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,820
Ouch! No wonder you're divorced.

33
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,240
It's not like I wanted to come here!

34
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,490
Shizue!

35
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,950
Idiot!

36
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,700
<i>Before I was even born,</i>
<i>Mum was back with her folks.</i>

37
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,750
<i>She falls in and out of love</i>
<i>too easily.</i>

38
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,500
<i>Then the whole family moved here.</i>

39
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,880
<i>But Mum's still waiting for romance.</i>

40
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,550
<i>Uncle Masayuki worked</i>
<i>at a stock company.</i>

41
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,890
<i>It's a long story, but he was fired.</i>

42
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,140
<i>He's got a short fuse,</i>
<i>and goes mad sometimes.</i>

43
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,850
Asshole! Jerk!

44
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,860
<i>Great-grandpa, lives an easy life,</i>
<i>telling lies and being selfish.</i>

45
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,530
I hit him! Pochi, Pochi!

46
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,240
Incredible!

47
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,030
Peak season and not even
a stray cat's come by.

48
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,660
We should never have done it!

49
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,950
Masayuki!

50
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
<i>What are you saying?</i>

51
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,120
The sky's blue.

52
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,460
<i>The stars are plentiful,</i>
<i>the air's so pure!</i>

53
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,550
I can't do it. I'm leaving.

54
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Hey, wait.

55
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,680
After all the effort...

56
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,340
Don't say that.

57
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,060
Yes, coming all the way...

58
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,400
...to this wonderful place.

59
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,070
We've worked hard, expecting guests.

60
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,320
Someone had better show up.

61
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,990
You'll pick up the first
handsome guy who comes.

62
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,830
How dare you, you short-arse ex-con!

63
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,330
- Stop it!
- Goody-goody!

64
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,540
Stop it!

65
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,010
I've had it!

66
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,850
I bake cakes, I clean,
and still no guests.

67
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,510
They'll come.

68
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,600
I'm sure they'll come
if we keep this up.

69
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,480
I'm doing nothing until they come.

70
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,810
Masayuki! Shizue! That's enough!

71
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,190
They'll come. I'm sure.

72
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,440
It's great here.

73
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,780
Magnificent guesthouse.
Even got a swing.

74
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,360
You fixed it?

75
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,330
Go on, sit on it.

76
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,700
You have to come here to appreciate it.

77
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,620
The swing feels so good.

78
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,710
It's great. Guests are bound to come.

79
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,130
They'll come!

80
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,230
<i>Hello there.</i>

81
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,830
Welcome.

82
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,580
Hiking?

83
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,760
Some tea on the terrace?

84
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,410
<i>Help!</i>

85
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,850
<i>I'm scared of the dark.</i>

86
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,730
<i>Why did you come here?</i>

87
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,900
Excuse us! Excuse us!

88
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,280
We're on a spiritualist training trip.

89
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,650
Don't mind us.

90
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,990
Excuse us.

91
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,550
Spiritualists have training trips too?

92
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:12,930
I wonder.

93
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,020
I knew they weren't guests.

94
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,190
People really do come this far.

95
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,330
THE HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS

96
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,960
<i>This is the story of</i>
<i>one summer's events,</i>

97
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,420
<i>for the family that I love.</i>

00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,110

Directed by Takashi Miike

105
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,580
<i>Thank you, God.</i>

106
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,630
Let's eat.

107
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,750
What looks good?

108
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,010
It's not the season for stews, is it?

109
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,180
Stews are great for leftovers.
If you don't like it, don't eat it.

110
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,600
It'll give you energy.

111
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,060
Full of goodness,
from all the vegetables.

112
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,390
That's why sumo wrestlers eat it.

113
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,070
What happened to the deer's body?

114
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,040
Its body?

115
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,460
Well...

116
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,500
One day...

117
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,550
...some guy with a rifle,
not Grandpa...

118
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,380
Bang bang bang!

119
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,260
...shot it and ate the body.

120
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,350
Did I spit some food?

121
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,010
A pickled plum?

122
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,810
Shit!

123
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,020
Ah, the spit.

124
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,130
OK, OK.

125
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,690
You saw it?

126
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,110
The body is in the wall.

127
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,950
Buried in the wall.

128
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Masayuki.

129
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,290
It's not dead.

130
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,790
Well, if that's what you think,
probably not.

131
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,710
Now, eat some tofu, blow on it.

132
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,010
The other day, he took hours
to fix a hole in the wall.

133
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,220
Dad?

134
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,310
This place is everything to him.

135
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,480
Dad likes tofu, so leave him some.

136
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,650
Not you, Yurie.

137
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,490
So it's not dead.
That's one way to look at it.

138
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,700
<i>At one Karuizawa guesthouse,</i>

139
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,960
<i>cute little animals help out</i>
<i>serving coffee and doing other chores.</i>

140
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,170
This cute animal service
became quite famous,

141
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,180
and now all the rooms are booked up,

142
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,050
from now until next year.

143
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,420
<i>It all started when</i>

144
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,560
the guesthouse's owner

145
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,980
<i>Mr. Sukeyoshi Honnoura</i>

146
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,190
<i>well, he got the idea...</i>

147
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,860
...of cutting labour costs.

148
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,990
Along with his family,

149
00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:00,200
he puts the farm animals to work
at his guesthouse.

150
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
Look, a bug.

151
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,090
<i>The pigs thought: 'We can either work</i>
<i>or become sausages'.</i>

152
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,180
So now they carry bags,

153
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,970
and serve coffee.

154
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,560
And that's why...

155
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,100
It's not coming out.

156
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,360
<i>They work like mad.</i>

157
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,490
<i>The animals...</i>

158
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,410
Leave it, don't change the channel.

159
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,120
Oh, let's see that.

160
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,320
Dem bones...

161
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,970
Isn't that actress
the same age as you, mum?

162
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,100
Look at the state of her.

163
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,420
Dem bones...

164
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,990
- A blackout?
- Mum.

165
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,290
<i>White Lovers' Guesthouse</i>

166
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,890
What are you surprised about?

167
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,520
You scared us to death.

168
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,690
Idiot!

169
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,100
Idiot?

170
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Hey.

171
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,030
Someone's outside.

172
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
A guest.

173
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,760
Want a room?

174
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,270
Thank you.

175
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,570
Would you care for any dinner?

176
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,530
Just a beer.

177
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,530
We'll bring it up to your room.

178
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:51,700
Breakfast is from 7:30 to 9:00
in the dining room.

179
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,920
Checkout is 10:00am.

180
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,710
Your room is upstairs.

181
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,430
Hey, sir.

182
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,520
Some of my clothes...
Feel free to use them.

183
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,850
Enjoy your stay.

184
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,860
Enjoy your stay.

185
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,810
<i>And when I get there,</i>

186
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,640
<i>it's a dead end.</i>

187
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,730
<i>Darkness creeps up...</i>

188
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,860
<i>in wispy shadows.</i>

189
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,580
<i>Even the slightest warmth,</i>

190
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,920
<i>leaves and deserts me,</i>

191
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,480
<i>and it hurts me.</i>

192
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,180
<i>Even the tears I cry...</i>

193
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,720
<i>dried up and emptied my heart.</i>

194
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,390
<i>At least smile when you go.</i>

195
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,070
Sayonara.

196
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,660
<i>Your beer, sir.</i>

197
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
<i>Excuse me.</i>

198
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,780
Thanks.

199
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,210
Squid guts?

200
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,760
- Tomorrow...
- Yes?

201
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,310
If the world was to end...

202
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,140
Huh?

203
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,390
If you were to die tomorrow...

204
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,850
...what would you do tonight?

205
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,150
Huh?

206
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,310
<i>Masayuki, it's your turn to mop.</i>

207
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,810
Well?

208
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,740
I'm off.

209
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,740
See you.

210
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,320
- Take care.
- I will.

211
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Hey, Shizue.

212
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,700
That really suits you.

213
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,870
Thank you.

214
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,290
As always.

215
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,710
Well, she likes it.

216
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,550
Shouldn't we wake up the guest now?

217
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
You're right.

218
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,610
<i>Good morning.</i>

219
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,450
<i>Breakfast is ready.</i>

220
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,870
<i>Excuse me, sir?</i>

221
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,110
<i>Sir? Sir!</i>

222
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,040
<i>Masayuki, get the key!</i>

223
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,470
<i>Dad!</i>

224
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,030
<i>Suicide?</i>

225
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,830
<i>Is that our key?</i>

226
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,580
<i>- Oh my god</i>
<i>- Dad!</i>

227
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,250
<i>Should we call the police, dear?</i>

228
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,750
<i>Calm down.</i>

229
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,280
<i>Calm down.</i>

230
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,180
<i>Where's the will?</i>

231
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,850
<i>He brought a knife.</i>

232
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,230
<i>Why didn't he use it?</i>

233
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,900
<i>Probably too depressed.</i>

234
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,340
Why?

235
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,430
Why did he have to die?

236
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,890
Why do it in our guesthouse?

237
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,650
Where's the will?

238
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,190
At least leave a will, you bastard.

239
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,650
A Will. A Will.

240
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,620
Come on. You must have a will.

241
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,370
Why did you have to die here?

242
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,460
There's something written here.

243
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,020
<i>Peach?</i>

244
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,320
A wallet. He had a wallet.

245
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,990
- Maybe there's something in it.
- His wallet!

246
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,870
- Not here.
- Or here.

247
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,550
What are you looking at me for?

248
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,050
We didn't say anything.

249
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,720
But you look at me like that.

250
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,890
You used to collect wallets.

251
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,260
That was long ago.

252
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,180
You think I killed him for his wallet?

253
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,390
No one said that.

254
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Might as well have.

255
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,810
- Masayuki.
- What?

256
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,400
Bring some plastic sheet and rope.

257
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,820
Just do as I say.

258
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,490
We have to call the police.

259
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,040
Don't! Wait.

260
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,910
Say the police let it out that
our first guest committed suicide.

261
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,380
No one will ever come and stay here!

262
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,710
If I lose this,
I don't know what I'll do!

263
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,180
This is the end for me.

264
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:29,970
Just look...
Does it look like a regular suicide?

265
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,180
Look at it.

266
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,860
Masayuki.

267
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,530
Bring the plastic sheet and rope.

268
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:47,130
<i>Maybe it's better</i>
<i>if we stop this, Masao?</i>

269
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,140
<i>I had nothing to do with it.</i>

270
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,160
<i>It has to be done. For everyone's sake.</i>

271
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,540
<i>What in the world...</i>

272
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,920
<i>are you doing?</i>

273
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,140
<i>My time will come soon too,</i>

274
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,640
<i>but I pray I don't see you lot there.</i>

275
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,540
<i>On my own, I remember,</i>

276
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,540
<i>the days when I was in love.</i>

277
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,180
<i>La la la, la vie en rose.</i>

278
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,970
<i>The colour of love.</i>

279
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,310
<i>La la la, my unruly heart,</i>

280
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,520
<i>beating fast.</i>

281
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,610
<i>La la la, just one more,</i>

282
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,910
<i>just one more time.</i>

283
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,200
<i>La la la, even though...</i>

284
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,380
<i>...it hurts.</i>

285
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,960
<i>Cast your magic spell on me.</i>

286
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,590
<i>The magic of your love.</i>

287
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:41,060
<i>Cast your magic love spell on me.</i>

288
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:47,270
<i>The magic of your love.</i>

289
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,290
Yurie.

290
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,790
Yes?

291
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,250
Would you be happy,

292
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,510
if you had a new daddy?

293
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,150
A bug?

294
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,600
<i>The feeling of love.</i>

295
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,190
<i>The wonderful moment that comes to all.</i>

296
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,060
<i>When god whispers...</i>

297
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,960
<i>I love you!</i>

298
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,570
<i>In the busiest moment,</i>
<i>a feeling of joy.</i>

299
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,080
<i>No more pain.</i>
<i>Just longing to hear your voice.</i>

300
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
<i>Desire.</i>

301
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,910
<i>All I need, are your words.</i>

302
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:15,920
<i>The magic of love envelops me.</i>

303
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,890
<i>When you fall in love,</i>

304
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,180
<i>everything shines brighter.</i>

305
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:35,040
<i>When God sings...</i>

306
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,120
<i>I love you!</i>

307
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,900
<i>These long nights I sleep alone.</i>

308
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:46,580
<i>At twilight, I wait for you,</i>
<i>it's all so delightfully...</i>

309
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,730
<i>Heartrending!</i>

310
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,080
<i>I want to hold your smiling face.</i>

311
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,630
<i>I'm so thankful I fell in love.</i>

312
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,650
<i>The magic of love envelops me.</i>

313
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,240
Hello? Hello?

314
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,420
Are you a serviceman?

315
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,290
I'm with the US Navy.

316
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,840
To be more precise,
Britain's Royal Navy.

317
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,050
Really? Your Japanese is excellent.

318
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,020
Yes, my father was Japanese.

319
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,430
Are you here on duty?

320
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:40,480
Yesterday...
I took up my post in Morioka.

321
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,730
I wanted a break so I came here.

322
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:48,700
I'm happy to have met someone like you.

323
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,660
What an adorable little girl.

324
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,540
Your mum is beautiful.

325
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,090
Your husband, I envy him.

326
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,590
Actually, I'm single.

327
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,430
Dad had an affair with
a high school girl.

328
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,680
Yeah!

329
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,350
Well, just between you and me,

330
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,730
I'm also a British secret agent.

331
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,690
By order of Queen Elizabeth,

332
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,610
give me your mobile number.

333
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,820
Mobile phones don't work where I live.

334
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,240
Oh... I'll... I'll be here.

335
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,370
My name is Shizue Katakuri.

336
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,540
What's your name?

337
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,210
I almost forgot
the most important thing.

338
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,170
I'm Richard Sagawa.

339
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,810
Richard Sagawa...

340
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,290
Who is it?

341
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

342
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

343
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:58,760
<i>A few more days passed</i>
<i>without any arrivals.</i>

344
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:04,480
<i>But no one said a word.</i>

345
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,710
Let's go.

346
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,670
<i>Ah, this looks delicious, see.</i>

347
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,140
Look, mmm, oh yes.

348
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
How are the noodles?

349
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,360
Masao, you have to eat something.

350
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,480
Delicious!

351
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,360
You have to eat to keep
your strength up, to be happy.

352
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:00,120
This is good. Really good.

353
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:11,250
How can it be so good?
Maybe because I'm hungry.

354
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,600
Maybe the dog wants some?
Hey, this is really good.

355
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,520
You want the fermented beans too?
You gourmet.

356
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,990
Pochi! Pochi!

357
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,940
<i>Hey, know what this is?</i>

358
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,530
<i>Do you know what that is?</i>

359
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,780
<i>What is it, then?</i>

360
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,830
Good, eh?

361
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,960
- Rough noodles.
- Right! You got it.

362
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,790
- Why?
- Well, how do dogs bark?

363
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,080
Ruff!

364
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,170
And what's he eating?

365
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,380
Noodles.

366
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,260
So, ruff noodles!

367
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,550
I'm done.

368
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,010
Huh?

369
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,270
<i>Keep going.</i>

370
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,700
Wow. Our first famous guest.

371
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,200
Wasn't he on
"Athletes' Singing Contest"?

372
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,870
This is your room.

373
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:35,090
We've found a really nice place.
No one will find us.

374
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,510
<i>Darling.</i>

375
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,600
<i>Still suspicious?</i>

376
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,230
Aren't you?

377
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,940
Me?

378
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,940
How many times has he deceived us?

379
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,910
He was the last one to see the guy,
when he took up the beer.

380
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,540
The guy's wallet is missing.

381
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,000
If the police came
and started investigating,

382
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,590
his past would come out,
it would complicate everything.

383
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:26,390
But he's such an honest, gentle soul.

384
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,170
You said you'd disown him,
but when he came back from jail,

385
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,390
you said, 'Let's all work together
for the guesthouse'.

386
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,260
It's only natural!

387
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,730
When his only son is down,

388
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,400
what father wouldn't
lend a helping hand?

389
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,780
See, you two are so alike.

390
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:30,620
He's too nice, that's why
he's popular. Just like you.

391
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,060
Hello, White...

392
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,310
Hello?

393
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,150
Hello, this is...

394
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,530
Yes? Yes?

395
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,320
I can hardly hear you.

396
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,160
Ah, well... Shizue?

397
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,370
Hold on a minute.

398
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,710
Go over there.

399
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,090
<i>- Shizue?</i>
- Oh, Richard!

400
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,590
<i>Yes, it's me, Richard.</i>

401
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:35,350
<i>I just wanted to hear your voice.</i>

402
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:38,210
<i>I'm currently flying over Iraq.</i>

403
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,670
<i>- Johnnie!</i>
- Who's Johnnie?

404
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,280
<i>This call is being bounced</i>
<i>via the Yokota Airbase in Japan.</i>

405
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,020
- Yokota?
<i>- Look out!</i>

406
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,030
<i>Be careful! I'll be waiting.</i>

407
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,000
Shizue, I love you!

408
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,110
Oh, me too!

409
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
Richard?

410
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,900
<i>Looking at him like this,</i>

411
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,530
<i>he seems even bigger.</i>

412
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,240
<i>He's inflating.</i>

413
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,500
Where's the girl?

414
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,080
<i>She's disappeared.</i>

415
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,670
<i>Maybe she ran off.</i>

416
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:54,970
<i>P... police.</i>

417
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,770
What?

418
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,640
We have to call the police.

419
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,560
There's no need.

420
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,730
What are you doing?

421
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,070
<i>Masayuki! Sheet and rope!</i>

422
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,240
<i>We should call the police...</i>
<i>this won't work.</i>

423
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,830
We'll never get him through the hall.

424
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,630
Maybe lower him down from here?

425
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,140
Chop him up?

426
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,100
What do you think?

427
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,100
<i>Do you realise what you're about to do?</i>

428
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,940
<i>Let's not.</i>
<i>It could expose the other one.</i>

429
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,860
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- This isn't over!</i>

430
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,950
<i>Just do as I say.</i>

431
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,410
<i>How come we only get guests like this!</i>

432
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,790
<i>What's the deal with these dead bodies?</i>

433
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
<i>Listen!</i>

434
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,460
<i>We must save the guesthouse.</i>

435
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,420
You're acting strangely, what...

436
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,340
<i>Guesthouse, bullshit!</i>

437
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,890
This place has no future.

438
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,600
<i>Masayuki! Stop it.</i>

439
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,310
<i>I started this</i>
<i>so we could all work together.</i>

440
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,440
<i>I'm not going to let this ruin it.</i>

441
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,690
You always say 'for everyone's sake'.

442
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:32,650
But your selfishness
dragged us all up here.

443
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,860
Don't you feel any responsibility?

444
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:41,200
I didn't drag you here.

445
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,450
You don't know how I feel!

446
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,670
If you want to leave, then go.

447
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:48,870
Masao!

448
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,090
<i>Stop!</i>

449
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,460
<i>There's no going back!</i>

450
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,380
<i>Nonsense, idiot!</i>

451
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:56,130
<i>Masayuki! Apologise!</i>

452
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:01,050
<i>Asshole! I have thought about it!</i>

453
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:04,560
<i>We have to do this for everyone's sake!</i>

454
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,890
If you're going to do it, do it fast!

455
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,390
<i>Are you doing it?</i>

456
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,110
This one's stiffer than he looks.
And heavier, too.

457
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,280
Popped Out!

458
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:21,870
It's... popped out!

459
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,790
What do you mean?

460
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,000
What are you talking about?

461
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,180
See?

462
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,020
What's going on?

463
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:51,400
Why is this happening?

464
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,190
Why do you all come out here to die?

465
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,030
What's wrong with you?

466
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:00,570
<i>Anyone home?</i>

467
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,620
<i>This is Officer Miyake.</i>

468
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,700
<i>Hello?</i>

469
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,790
<i>Mr. Katakuri of</i>
<i>"White Lovers' Guesthouse"?</i>

470
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,630
Coming!

471
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,240
You go!

472
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,470
I'm Officer Miyake.

473
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,930
Welcome...

474
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:31,980
...to our remote area.

475
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,360
I just came up the mountain on my bike.

476
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,610
Thank you.

477
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:39,690
A little one too!

478
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,320
- Hi.
- Hi.

479
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,870
I'm Officer Miyake.

480
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:50,580
Would you mind filling out this form?

481
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,370
I'll do it.

482
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:55,170
Thank you.

483
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,760
Er...

484
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,100
Yes?

485
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,480
- Um...
- Shizue.

486
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:23,770
Truth is...

487
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:27,490
I had a very difficult birth
with her...

488
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,870
Thankfully she's grown up all right.

489
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,160
Hurry up and fill it out.

490
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,460
A difficult birth, eh?

491
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,380
She's popped out!

492
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,210
A guest?

493
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,510
- Yes!
- No!

494
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:46,390
What was that noise?

495
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:50,640
We were just about to tidy up.

496
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,230
Who should do what...

497
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,680
Something fell over.

498
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,570
How many guests have you had?

499
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,410
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have asked.

500
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:12,120
But some people like
these quiet places.

501
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,670
Yeah, can't complain.

502
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,670
Great to see a family pulling together.

503
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:24,050
Oh, there's this too...

504
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,090
A wanted poster.

505
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,560
I'll leave it here.

506
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,720
Thank you.

507
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,230
Pochi? That's your dog?

508
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,860
Yes.

509
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:44,030
<i>Well, goodbye.</i>

510
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,200
Thank you, bye.

511
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,030
Keep it up!

512
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:36,870
This'll do.

513
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,660
I've never done this kind of thing.

514
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:42,960
Hey, he's massive! OK.

515
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,640
- Shizue!
- Yes!

516
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,600
Darling!

517
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:56,970
What?

518
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,640
It's not like he's breakable.

519
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,440
The poor thing.

520
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,150
<i>Hello?</i>

521
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,380
Are you from the guesthouse?

522
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,840
Yes.

523
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,060
Do you have any cake?

524
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,060
<i>Can we get something to eat?</i>

525
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:24,770
Yes!

526
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:28,900
Ordinary people.

527
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:31,940
Ordinary people!

528
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,200
Really ordinary.

529
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,200
Mum, Mum... where's the sugar?

530
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,620
In the cupboard.

531
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,790
OK, hold this.

532
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,130
Hurry! Hurry!

533
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,720
You've got something on your face!

534
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,090
That's alright, I'll eat it.

535
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,730
Here you go.

536
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,320
It's all home-made.

537
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,690
<i>Here's the sugar.</i>

538
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:13,730
Enjoy!

539
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:18,490
<i>Under one roof and sky,</i>

540
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,080
<i>laughing and sleeping...</i>

541
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:23,290
<i>My dream of living together.</i>

542
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:29,340
<i>If you want to go, just go.</i>

543
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,260
<i>When you get lonely, just come back.</i>

544
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:38,430
<i>Let's live here.</i>

545
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,390
<i>Let's start here.</i>

546
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,640
<i>In this new place.</i>

547
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:48,770
<i>There's a big new road coming.</i>

548
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:55,350
<i>Will it bring happiness?</i>

549
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:58,860
<i>Happiness is made by all.</i>

550
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,160
<i>That's right. By the whole family.</i>

551
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:08,830
<i>Let's live here. Start here together.</i>

552
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:15,800
<i>On this road to happiness and health.</i>

553
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:21,350
<i>Let's live here. Start here together.</i>

554
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:29,190
<i>On this road to happiness and health.</i>

555
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:35,070
<i>Let's live here. Start together here.</i>

556
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:41,120
<i>On this road to happiness and health.</i>

557
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:48,370
<i>Let's live here. Start together here.</i>

558
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:56,170
<i>On this road to happiness and health.</i>

559
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,860
What?

560
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,570
Is that so?

561
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,240
Thank you.

562
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,080
Near the lake.

563
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,090
<i>We look forward to it.</i>

564
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:46,310
We've been praying for a big road.

565
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,180
We're jumping for joy.

566
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,680
Yes, thank you.

567
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,320
Don't do that!

568
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:02,950
What is it?

569
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,030
That road construction.

570
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:09,370
The date isn't decided yet,

571
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
but they're digging
the whole lake area.
So...

572
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:21,720
We'll move them.

573
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:09,540
Dem bones...

574
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,160
Richard.

575
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,550
Shizue,
I've thought about you every day.

576
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:44,340
What are you up to?

577
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,680
I was on the phone.

578
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:52,890
Someone was making an enquiry.

579
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:59,020
Welcome. I'm so happy that you're safe.

580
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:00,480
I missed you.

581
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,530
Are you thirsty? A drink?

582
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,200
Or something to eat?

583
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:26,090
I want to eat you.

584
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:45,690
<i>Stinks of disinfectant.</i>

585
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:50,570
<i>White Lovers' Guesthouse</i>

586
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,140
2,212 Yen!

587
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:06,020
How lucky!

588
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:53,650
After shampooing, I cut my hair.

589
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,620
Maybe I messed up.

590
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:12,670
We should have marked the location.

591
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:18,300
When did you make that thing?

592
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,510
Just now.

593
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,390
You planned to put it here?

594
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:28,480
Otherwise we'll forget where they are.

595
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:31,440
I thought we'd need this.

596
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,860
Everyone who comes by will see it.

597
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,490
Maybe not, then.

598
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:44,450
But then again, it is a work of art.

599
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:47,830
Uh, about here...

600
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,960
Well?

601
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,460
Over here wasn't it?

602
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:53,710
There?

603
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,800
Where the road will be?

604
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:17,400
<i>Please join us.</i>

605
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:21,240
<i>Everyone, sing along.</i>

606
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,400
<i>I got this far</i>

607
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,920
<i>because of your smiling face.</i>

608
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,980
<i>No,</i>

609
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:42,850
<i>I simply followed you, ace.</i>

610
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:47,050
<i>Together,</i>

611
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:52,610
<i>how far have we come?</i>

612
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:58,070
<i>Before I knew it, I was happy.</i>

613
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:04,150
<i>That sounds snappy.</i>

614
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:11,480
<i>All the hardships...</i>

615
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:16,410
<i>Are long forgotten.</i>

616
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:20,960
<i>Dreams and joys...</i>

617
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:25,390
<i>and so much more.</i>

618
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:32,520
<i>But your gentle, true heart...</i>

619
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:37,060
<i>is my solace.</i>

620
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:42,320
<i>Our true gentle hearts...</i>

621
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:47,570
<i>...are our solace.</i>

622
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:01,930
<i>No promotion, no money,</i>

623
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:06,050
<i>all I have is my health.</i>

624
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:09,360
<i>Yes,</i>

625
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:16,630
<i>you have energy and strength.</i>

626
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,940
<i>You always...</i>

627
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:25,780
<i>gave me a helping hand.</i>

628
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:30,830
<i>Sometimes even a helping kick.</i>

629
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:38,670
<i>I'd be hopeless without it.</i>

630
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:44,630
<i>I have no regrets.</i>

631
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:54,070
<i>Dreams and joys...</i>

632
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:58,440
<i>and so much more.</i>

633
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:05,570
<i>But your gentle, true heart...</i>

634
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:10,030
<i>is my solace.</i>

635
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:15,370
<i>Our true gentle hearts...</i>

636
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:20,190
<i>are our solace.</i>

637
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,010
<i>Our true gentle hearts...</i>

638
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:30,030
<i>are our solace.</i>

639
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:11,010
We have to dig them out.

640
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,020
We have to rebury them.

641
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,910
Your job is so demanding.

642
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:32,780
Well...

643
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:37,460
There's something I should tell you.

644
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:40,790
My mother is in fact...

645
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:46,590
...Queen Elizabeth's youngest sister.

646
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:51,340
But they're half sisters,
so it's not officially admitted.

647
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:54,970
It's very tiring, the royal family.

648
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:57,480
The royal family!

649
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:15,370
But when I was little,

650
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:20,500
I remember being cuddled
by Aunt Elizabeth.

651
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,500
Diana! If only I'd been there!

652
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:32,050
She often called me for advice.

653
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,560
I said to Charles:

654
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:49,650
'You must treasure your wife'.

655
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:56,870
<i>The crash happened</i>
<i>when I was away on duty.</i>

656
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:58,750
<i>So sad.</i>

657
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:02,000
I can't forgive the paparazzi.

658
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:09,800
Mother came to Japan to study,

659
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:12,050
and fell in love with my father.

660
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:18,140
Father was a student
at Tokyo Imperial University.

661
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,890
That's amazing.

662
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:22,060
Not at all.

663
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,020
Father wanted to be a painter,

664
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:30,690
but as a doctor's son,
he had to go and study.

665
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,870
So that's where you get
your artistic talent.

666
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:38,910
I wanted to paint too,

667
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:43,750
but Aunt Elizabeth objected.

668
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:45,630
Oh dear.

669
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,000
Shizue.

670
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:52,630
I'd like to paint you.

671
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:09,570
<i>Shizue, you are very beautiful.</i>

672
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:14,610
<i>Father used to say</i>
<i>Japanese women are wonderful.</i>

673
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:18,450
<i>Now I've met you, I really think so.</i>

674
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:23,160
<i>No Parisian girl nor Russian ballerina</i>

675
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:26,120
<i>is a match for a Japanese woman.</i>

676
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:29,920
<i>I've never met anyone like you, Shizue.</i>

677
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:32,920
<i>I want to go to Paris</i>

678
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:36,470
<i>and live there with you,</i>
<i>painting pictures.</i>

679
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:42,220
<i>It's like a dream.</i>

680
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:48,980
<i>I must go to England</i>
<i>to explain to Aunt Elizabeth.</i>

681
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:53,570
<i>But my funds are strictly</i>
<i>limited to official duties.</i>

682
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:55,950
<i>If I return to England...</i>

683
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,660
<i>It's so embarrassing.</i>

684
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:02,330
<i>If you just lend me the airfare,</i>
<i>I can come back rich!</i>

685
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:06,710
<i>But what am I saying!</i>

686
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,540
<i>Don't worry...</i>

687
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:11,040
So that's his plan.

688
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,550
<i>I'll take care.</i>

689
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:19,720
<i>Aren't the stars beautiful?</i>

690
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:38,850
<i>Ah!</i>

691
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:40,370
<i>Oh dear, your nose!</i>

692
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,910
<i>My nose isn't bleeding</i>
<i>because I'm horny.</i>

693
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:52,170
<i>The blood is rushing</i>
<i>to enhance my critical faculties.</i>

694
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,840
<i>And as I have much</i>
<i>more blood than a Japanese,</i>

695
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,510
<i>it surges uncontrollably.</i>

696
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,180
<i>Beyond all reason.</i>

697
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:07,060
<i>Uncontrollable!</i>

698
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:08,770
Asshole!

699
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,980
Richard!

700
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:22,320
Our ashtray?

701
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,330
You cheapskate asshole!

702
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:26,910
Bastard!

703
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,290
Want a fight? Come on!

704
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,580
Hold on.

705
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:34,880
Hit an old man, would you?

706
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:36,250
Hold it.

707
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:38,800
You bastard.

708
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,300
You old fart.

709
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:42,590
Richard!

710
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:46,310
What? Keep out of it.

711
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:48,640
I know, it hurts, I know.

712
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:50,850
Let's forget it.

713
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:52,440
Die, old geezer.

714
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:53,730
Richard!

715
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:56,570
What?

716
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:01,490
Here, take it.

717
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,700
Die!

718
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:09,160
My eyes are spinning...

719
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:13,370
<i>Grandpa!</i>

720
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:15,710
Wow, we're so high up.

721
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,470
Are you OK, Grandpa?

722
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,720
Hey...

723
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,040
Stop it.

724
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:53,410
<i>Look out!</i>

725
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:56,380
Asshole!

726
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:13,270
Richard!

727
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:42,460
<i>Shizue.</i>

728
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:47,840
<i>This will be our little secret.</i>

729
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:50,180
<i>OK?</i>

730
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:55,220
<i>Grandpa.</i>

731
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,920
<i>All men are assholes.</i>

732
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:27,720
<i>Mum, why did you marry Dad?</i>

733
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:31,270
<i>Well...</i>

734
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:38,020
<i>The first time your dad stayed</i>
<i>with me, the next morning...</i>

735
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:42,690
<i>he got all my shoes out of the closet</i>

736
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:46,940
<i>and polished them in his underwear.</i>

737
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:49,820
<i>At that moment I decided,</i>

738
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:56,330
<i>I wanted to cook for him forever.</i>

739
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:00,830
I'm jealous.

740
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:07,760
Dad would probably eat poison
if you cooked it.

741
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
He'd be easy to kill.
Really!

742
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:53,550
Sachiko, I'm sorry, forgive me.

743
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:59,390
Michiko, Yoshie,
I never meant to make you unhappy.

744
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:01,770
It's all my fault.

745
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:05,520
Kimiyo, Yuka, Kazue, forgive me.

746
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,150
Sachiko, Yuko,

747
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:12,910
Miyuki, sorry.

748
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,830
Shi... Shi...

749
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:36,350
Shimizu Yoko!

750
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:44,020
Is he dead?

751
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:47,480
What's wrong now?

752
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:52,490
An actor?

753
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:58,950
He's a member
of the British royal family,

754
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,910
and a pilot with the US Air Force.

755
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,440
No way.

756
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:11,090
The bastard! Look what he's holding!

757
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:19,220
Tissues from the dial-a-date club
at the station!

758
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,930
You think a real pilot
would carry this?

759
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:25,230
What's this?

760
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:30,980
<i>Shochiku Film Studio Rental Costume...</i>

761
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:35,240
He's not a foreigner?

762
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,200
<i>No way.</i>

763
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,040
<i>Darling...</i>

764
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:49,880
Not another one.

765
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,710
<i>Hey, look, hey.</i>

766
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:55,260
A wallet.

767
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:56,420
What?

768
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,980
See, I told you it wasn't me.

769
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:15,110
<i>The bastard!</i>

770
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:18,160
He stole our ashtray too.

771
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:20,370
But why did he have to die here'?

772
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:24,450
And after falling down that
gully so well too, asshole!

773
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:48,350
Yes, Officer Miyake.

774
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,440
Yes.

775
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:53,110
What!

776
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:54,730
A dead body?

777
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:05,200
<i>A typhoon is approaching,</i>
<i>moving slowly, gaining intensity.</i>

778
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:08,830
<i>After midnight, the whole area...</i>

779
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,920
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

780
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:19,260
The picture's gone funny.

781
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:21,800
It's the aerial.

782
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,730
A guest?

783
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:37,890
Maybe.

784
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:52,710
What will it be this time?

785
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,490
Do you have a room available?

786
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:38,500
Would you like two rooms?

787
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,800
Just one, the cheapest.

788
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,720
Thank you.

789
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:57,150
Welcome, this way please.

790
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,730
Please, as you are.

791
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:25,930
Don't you have a bad feeling
about this?

792
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,480
Excuse me.

793
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:41,320
Do you have some strong cord
I could borrow?

794
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:45,740
Cord?

795
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:53,500
I need some, if you have any.

796
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,470
I'll find some and bring it right up.

797
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:05,720
Please.

798
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:25,320
Maybe we should prepare ourselves
for the worst.

799
01:23:25,490 --> 01:23:26,490
Yes.

800
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,640
This wet ground...

801
01:23:55,890 --> 01:23:57,980
...really gives you back ache.

802
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,600
Well, Grandpa?

803
01:23:59,810 --> 01:24:00,810
What?

804
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:06,240
Oh, that'll do, that's fine.

805
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:30,380
What?

806
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:32,600
I can hear something.

807
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:36,110
A flute.

808
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:02,880
The cord.

809
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:06,960
Er...

810
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:10,090
What's the hole for?

811
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,300
It's for the garbage.

812
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:20,470
Hard work.

813
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:25,690
Thanks for everything.

814
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:45,380
<i>What's this?</i>

815
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:29,800
What are you burying him for?

816
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:49,170
<i>Look on the bright side.</i>

817
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,850
<i>OK!</i>

818
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:56,090
<i>- Always be positive.</i>
<i>- OK!</i>

819
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:00,050
<i>Oh, you can look away.</i>

820
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:01,290
<i>Really?</i>

821
01:28:01,390 --> 01:28:03,930
<i>You can even stop.</i>

822
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:05,270
<i>Go on, go on!</i>

823
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:10,480
<i>But always get moving again.</i>

824
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:16,990
<i>Even if no one is waiting for you.</i>

825
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:24,580
<i>- Looking good.</i>
<i>- Let's go.</i>

826
01:28:24,990 --> 01:28:29,590
<i>Let's go slowly.</i>

827
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,950
<i>With chins up high.</i>

828
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:38,800
<i>Are we losers</i>

829
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:42,930
<i>looking back to the past?</i>

830
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:48,640
<i>Don't try too hard to forget.</i>

831
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:56,950
<i>In the end, it's just a memory.</i>

832
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:07,340
<i>Let's go together.</i>

833
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:08,710
<i>Take me with you!</i>

834
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,770
<i>Let's hold hands.</i>

835
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:17,960
<i>Man is a weak...</i>

836
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:22,340
<i>and lonely thing.</i>

837
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:26,970
<i>So until we finally close our eyes,</i>

838
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:34,790
<i>let's live to laugh and dance.</i>

839
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,000
Where am I? Shit!

840
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:37,710
What the hell!

841
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:39,960
What is this! Damn.

842
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:14,250
Good morning!

843
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:18,080
Morning.

844
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:20,790
Shit... Shit...

845
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,640
What?

846
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:30,930
What is it?

847
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,440
Dad.

848
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:51,530
- It can't be.
- They found out?

849
01:31:58,370 --> 01:32:00,830
What shall I do? What?

850
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:07,090
Look! Look at this! Shit!

851
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:09,260
Damn.

852
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,440
Terue, look inside.

853
01:32:21,230 --> 01:32:22,270
Please.

854
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:23,690
OK.

855
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:32,490
Masao.

856
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:51,900
<i>I shall go.</i>

857
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:55,560
<i>Don't be stupid.</i>

858
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:58,180
<i>I did it.</i>

859
01:32:58,350 --> 01:33:01,190
<i>I'm guilty of... everything.</i>

860
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:04,310
<i>Too incredible!</i>

861
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:07,360
<i>Nobody would believe it.</i>

862
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:10,530
<i>Don't think about it.</i>

863
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:13,620
<i>Masao, you did your best.</i>

864
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:16,020
<i>Dad.</i>

865
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:18,040
<i>I shall go.</i>

866
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:22,330
<i>As long as you're here,</i>
<i>the Katakuri family will be OK.</i>

867
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:24,710
<i>Don't worry.</i>

868
01:33:25,210 --> 01:33:31,010
<i>I gave up my life once during the war.</i>

869
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:34,090
<i>Grandpa, wait,</i>

870
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:37,500
<i>I'll go!</i>

871
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,140
<i>Masayuki, good for you.</i>

872
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:45,610
<i>Spoken like a real Japanese.</i>

873
01:33:46,230 --> 01:33:49,780
<i>But it's times like these,</i>
<i>when luck's run out,</i>

874
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:55,160
<i>that old coots like me should go.</i>

875
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:58,540
<i>No, it should be me.</i>

876
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:00,830
<i>I suggested we bury them.</i>

877
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:05,960
<i>Fact is, I dragged everyone here.</i>

878
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,550
<i>I was wrong and I'm sorry.</i>

879
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,970
<i>That's not true.</i>

880
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:14,970
<i>That is true.</i>

881
01:34:15,510 --> 01:34:17,350
<i>No it's not.</i>

882
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:21,330
<i>Yes it is.</i>

883
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:28,980
<i>What is happiness?</i>

884
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:33,400
<i>In all these years,</i>
<i>I've learnt just one thing.</i>

885
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:39,990
<i>No one should die in a way</i>
<i>that saddens anyone.</i>

886
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:46,460
<i>People should laugh at funerals:</i>
<i>'He did well to live this long'!</i>

887
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:54,970
<i>How you die</i>
<i>is all down to how you live.</i>

888
01:34:56,550 --> 01:34:57,680
<i>Grandpa.</i>

889
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:02,390
<i>Don't worry. God's kind to fools.</i>

890
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:14,440
Shit! They followed me! Shit!
They're all following me!

891
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,000
These are detectives
with the county police.

892
01:35:34,210 --> 01:35:35,380
Mr Katakuri,

893
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:39,090
there's been a homicide.

894
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:51,570
<i>Hello!</i>

895
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:59,530
<i>Down at the foot of the mountain</i>
<i>a woman was killed at a guesthouse.</i>

896
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:02,080
<i>We believe her lover did it,</i>

897
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:05,540
<i>but we lost track of him.</i>

898
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:09,040
Had any suspicious guests lately?

899
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:14,880
This is Grandpa's.

900
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:25,310
Dad.

901
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,810
Could we see your guest register?

902
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:31,650
And look in the grove out back?

903
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:34,440
<i>- Asshole!</i>
<i>- Asshole?</i>

904
01:36:34,690 --> 01:36:37,990
You bastard! Damn you!

905
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:41,660
<i>It's coming! Coming!</i>

906
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,280
A hit!

907
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:45,830
You bastard!

908
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:48,540
Terue!

909
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:50,000
Damn you all!

910
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:51,830
- Let her go!
- Don't move.

911
01:36:54,130 --> 01:36:55,960
Shut up! Shoot, go on and shoot.

912
01:36:56,130 --> 01:36:58,420
Come on! Shoot, damn you.

913
01:36:58,800 --> 01:36:59,840
OK, OK, calm down.

914
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:03,430
<i>- Darling!</i>
<i>- Let her go.</i>

915
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:05,180
<i>- Let her go!</i>
<i>- Don't move.</i>

916
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:06,470
Calm down.

917
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:10,270
You killed the woman down
at the guesthouse!

918
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,020
<i>You killed your wife!</i>

919
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:14,110
Yes! Shut up, bastard!

920
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:16,730
It's Nobuko's fault. It's her fault.

921
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:18,110
Let go of her!

922
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:19,860
Darling!

923
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,780
Please stop.

924
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,620
Why did you do it?

925
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:32,460
Was it so unforgivable?

926
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:37,130
Or was it unforgivable
because you loved her?

927
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:42,220
- Shut up!
- Easy.

928
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:44,220
I killed her because I loved her.

929
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:47,890
What do you know, you bastard?

930
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:50,020
How can you understand Nobuko and me'?

931
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:53,480
Stand up!

932
01:37:54,150 --> 01:37:55,270
Nobuko!

933
01:37:56,230 --> 01:37:57,820
Nobuko, I'm sorry.

934
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,230
Nobuko!

935
01:38:03,910 --> 01:38:04,910
Hey,

936
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:12,960
did you love Nobuko that much?

937
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:15,690
Me too.

938
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:21,340
I love Terue more than
anything in the world.

939
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:28,220
<i>I can understand your love.</i>

940
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:31,980
<i>So you have to understand</i>
<i>how I feel too.</i>

941
01:38:32,890 --> 01:38:35,900
<i>So please let her go.</i>

942
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:39,650
<i>I beg you.</i>

943
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:44,150
The woman you're holding on to
so tightly now,

944
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:46,490
isn't your wife.

945
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:50,740
She's my beloved wife.

946
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:54,460
Please understand.

947
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:56,170
I beg you.

948
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:57,880
Shut up!

949
01:38:59,090 --> 01:39:01,550
<i>OK, then take me hostage instead.</i>

950
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,470
<i>Take me instead.</i>

951
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:04,920
Shut up!

952
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,090
<i>I beg you.</i>

953
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:09,010
Never.

954
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:10,260
I beg you.

955
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:18,800
Please!

956
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,610
<i>I beg you.</i>

957
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:28,120
<i>Please.</i>

958
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:33,200
I beg you.

959
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,540
I beg you!

960
01:39:47,050 --> 01:39:48,180
Terue!

961
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:21,210
Alright.

962
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:30,510
Hey!

963
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:31,800
Let go, you asshole!

964
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:34,760
Masayuki!

965
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,400
Nobuko!

966
01:40:42,610 --> 01:40:43,610
Masayuki!

967
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:56,860
<i>Mum.</i>

968
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:59,370
Be brave!

969
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:17,360
<i>How precious... our son is!</i>

970
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:18,470
<i>Masayuki.</i>

971
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:20,930
<i>Mum.</i>

972
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,560
<i>Are you all right?</i>

973
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:24,730
<i>I'm all right.</i>

974
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:27,860
<i>I'm right here.</i>

975
01:41:28,190 --> 01:41:30,060
<i>Dad.</i>

976
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:31,240
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

977
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:35,530
<i>I wasn't a good son.</i>

978
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:37,370
<i>Nonsense.</i>

979
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:42,290
<i>But I'm proud to be your son.</i>

980
01:41:43,790 --> 01:41:46,090
<i>It hurts! It hurts!</i>

981
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:47,800
<i>Be brave.</i>

982
01:41:49,130 --> 01:41:51,330
<i>Sis.</i>

983
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:53,930
<i>You're quite a babe.</i>

984
01:41:58,310 --> 01:42:02,910
<i>So, keep trying.</i>

985
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:08,090
<i>Don't die!</i>

986
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:12,580
Masayuki!

987
01:42:23,290 --> 01:42:24,290
Is that it?

988
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:32,970
- It's this big.
- This big?

989
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:35,260
- A graze?
- This big?

990
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,680
Just a scratch!

991
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:04,160
That's good.

992
01:43:18,050 --> 01:43:19,720
Hey, wait!

993
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:44,830
<i>Where's Pochi?</i>

994
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:46,370
Find Pochi!

995
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:51,170
<i>Pochi!</i>

996
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:53,500
<i>Pochi!</i>

997
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:56,650
<i>Pochi!</i>

998
01:43:57,380 --> 01:44:00,430
- Where are you going?
- Darling!

999
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:02,810
- Impossible!
- Darling!

1000
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:04,060
Masao!

1001
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:06,560
<i>Pochi.</i>

1002
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:08,020
Give me your paw.

1003
01:44:08,230 --> 01:44:10,770
Give Dad your paw.

1004
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:12,020
<i>Incredible.</i>

1005
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:18,610
<i>You OK?</i>

1006
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,120
<i>- Darling!</i>
<i>- Pochi.</i>

1007
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:23,410
<i>Pochi, that was dose.</i>

1008
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:27,210
- Right, that's it, it's OK.
- Sorry.

1009
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:29,710
<i>Here it comes.</i>

1010
01:44:30,290 --> 01:44:31,960
Everyone, stick together!

1011
01:44:32,130 --> 01:44:33,170
Right.

1012
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:36,760
<i>Hold hands.</i>

1013
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:39,160
<i>Yes.</i>

1014
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,890
<i>Hold my hand tight, Yurie.</i>

1015
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:44,060
<i>- Mum, Pochi!</i>
<i>- Grandpa!</i>

1016
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:45,770
<i>Everyone!</i>

1017
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:47,980
<i>Hold hands!</i>

1018
01:44:52,190 --> 01:44:53,610
Go for it, everyone!

1019
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,120
<i>Grandpa's gone.</i>

1020
01:45:06,330 --> 01:45:07,370
<i>There's Grandpa!</i>

1021
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:26,430
<i>Grandpa laughed and said,</i>

1022
01:45:26,970 --> 01:45:30,770
<i>"Never give up saying 'that's life'.</i>

1023
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,440
<i>Remember,</i>

1024
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:39,650
<i>anything can happen in life".</i>

1025
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:45,990
<i>The human race has survived</i>
<i>thousands and millions of years,</i>

1026
01:45:46,450 --> 01:45:48,490
<i>living bravely and tenaciously.</i>

1027
01:45:53,790 --> 01:45:55,390
Darling.

1028
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:07,810
<i>He's awake.</i>

1029
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:09,470
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

1030
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:12,770
Can you see us?

1031
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:14,310
You OK?

1032
01:46:15,690 --> 01:46:16,940
Survived.

1033
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:21,570
Thank God.

1034
01:46:27,870 --> 01:46:30,470
<i>Pochi.</i>

1035
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:55,060
Wait.

1036
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:57,560
Look over here.

1037
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:21,130
It's beautiful.

1038
01:47:30,970 --> 01:47:34,600
<i>So, let's go! Let's go!</i>

1039
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:38,440
<i>The sun is watching with a smile.</i>

1040
01:47:38,650 --> 01:47:42,110
<i>Let's sing!</i>

1041
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:45,700
<i>Like the birds, aim for the sky.</i>

1042
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:49,550
<i>Let's laugh!</i>

1043
01:47:49,650 --> 01:47:53,580
<i>Leave your sadness to the wind.</i>

1044
01:47:53,830 --> 01:47:57,330
<i>Tomorrow will be fine, we're all well.</i>

1045
01:47:57,540 --> 01:48:02,920
<i>Let's laugh together, that's happiness!</i>

1046
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:23,320
<i>Let's laugh.</i>

1047
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:27,320
<i>Leave your sadness to the wind.</i>

1048
01:48:27,490 --> 01:48:30,910
<i>Tomorrow will be fine, we're all well.</i>

1049
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:37,580
<i>Let's laugh together, that's happiness.</i>

1050
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:50,300
<i>The following year,</i>

1051
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:53,140
<i>Great-grandpa Nihei dropped dead.</i>

1052
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:16,580
<i>Man is just one of nature's creatures</i>

1053
01:49:18,290 --> 01:49:22,040
<i>and one day mankind will probably...</i>

1054
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:27,300
<i>...lose the game of natural selection.</i>

1055
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,970
<i>But until that time,</i>

1056
01:49:31,470 --> 01:49:35,220
<i>man goes on living,</i>
<i>earnestly, touchingly.</i>

1057
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:38,930
<i>That's...</i>

1058
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:41,640
<i>...life.</i>

1059
01:50:18,930 --> 01:50:19,930
Yeah!
