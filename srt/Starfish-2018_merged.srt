00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,629
Hello?

3
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:03,798
Anybody?

4
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:09,637
Please.

5
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:12,705
Hey.

6
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:14,040
Please.

7
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:16,642
Did you hear that?

8
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:17,745
What is that?

9
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,153
Pass it over here.

10
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:31,957
Hello?

11
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,592
Oh my god.

12
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,561
Oh my god, can you hear me?

13
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,681
But keep this
woman, oh King of kings,

14
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,785
beneath thy almighty wings.

15
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,789
Oh God, the spirit
of all our joys,

16
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:08,861
the cause of our delights, the
glory of our darkest nights,

17
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,832
and the comfort of
times like these.

18
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,695
Strange, isn't it?

19
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,667
Everybody's always smiling.

20
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,736
I keep just waiting
for her to walk in

21
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,041
and stop all this nonsense.

22
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,740
It's Aubrey, isn't it?

23
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,075
Aubrey Parker, right?

24
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,475
From Spirit 105 AM.

25
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,811
- I remember you.
- I remember you.

26
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:08,381
I didn't know you knew Grace.

27
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:22,930
Hey.

28
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:24,899
Hey.

29
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,969
I don't know how he does it.

30
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,072
Mark, I mean.

31
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,908
I don't know how he puts
up with all the consoling.

32
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,811
I couldn't handle it.

33
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,079
I didn't know
what to say to him.

34
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,082
I just left.

35
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,452
He looked right at me.

36
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:53,526
I'm Alice, once of Grace's
English cousins, obviously.

37
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,429
I'm Aubrey.

38
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,966
You're Aubrey?

39
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:05,670
God, I don't think I ever
had a conversation with Grace

40
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,840
where you weren't mentioned.

41
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,947
You escaping?

42
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,681
Yeah.

43
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,150
Yeah.

44
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:22,356
I have a flight in the
morning that I gotta catch.

45
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,891
Your speech was
really beautiful.

46
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,997
I love hearing about
grown ups as kids.

47
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,069
Well, you should go.

48
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,872
Yeah.

49
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:47,745
I'm sorry to ask,
did you get her letter?

50
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,082
She was obsessed with this song.

51
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:52,917
She kept playing it
over and over again.

52
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,519
It seemed to be
something that helped.

53
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,322
She'd take her
walks, and the music,

54
00:05:57,324 --> 00:06:01,393
she kept saying, "Aubrey
would understand.

55
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:02,994
"Aubrey would get it."

56
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:52,124
I still don't know
how you drank this shit.

57
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,110
Oh, fuck.

58
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:05,665
Hungry?

59
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:00,251
Hey, Bellini.

60
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,388
No bitey bitey, okay?

61
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:06,852
Perv.

62
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:15,974
Hello?

63
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:24,616
Hello?

64
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:28,987
My name is Aubrey Parker.

65
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:34,792
And I broke into my
dead friend's apartment.

66
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,729
Who the fuck are you?

67
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:50,340
Who are you talking to?

68
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:51,052
Hey, mom.

69
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:53,755
Aubrey, I didn't
recognize the number.

70
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:54,856
Yeah.

71
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:56,057
Honey.

72
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:57,859
How's your night?

73
00:19:57,861 --> 00:19:58,760
Are you okay?

74
00:19:58,762 --> 00:19:59,729
How did it go?

75
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,697
It went.

76
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:04,032
Was Edward there?

77
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:06,366
Did you get to speak with him?

78
00:20:06,368 --> 00:20:07,268
No.

79
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,403
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

80
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:10,738
Look, I think...

81
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,539
Do you remember...

82
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,339
We're the ones...

83
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:13,107
are going to...

84
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:13,908
Okay?

85
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:17,045
I think
you're cracking up, mom.

86
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:18,746
Honey.

87
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:20,380
Baby, I wish you were here.

88
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:22,283
I wish you could just fly...

89
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:23,084
For the holidays...

90
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:23,885
It's so...

91
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:24,686
Yeah.

92
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:26,688
Time zone.

93
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,056
Sweetie?

94
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:28,790
Well, I just
wanted to hear your voice.

95
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:29,858
Wait a minute.

96
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,758
I'm...

97
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,793
Honey, I can't hear you...

98
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:36,430
Mom,
I can't hear you.

99
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:38,233
Listen,
make sure you get...

100
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:39,566
Okay?

101
00:20:39,568 --> 00:20:40,367
Happy New...

102
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:41,137
Baby.

103
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:44,808
Happy New Year.

104
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,752
Now, let's take
a little trip back in time,

105
00:20:57,754 --> 00:21:00,587
just you and me, Nate Fowles,

106
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:02,957
on this beautiful
crispy New Year's Eve

107
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:06,460
right here in the
mountains on Sparrow 103.

108
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:46,893
Edward.

109
00:23:09,952 --> 00:23:10,917
What the...

110
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,521
Hello?

111
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:02,057
Hello?

112
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

113
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,701
Hey!

114
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:15,323
Aubrey.

115
00:28:16,357 --> 00:28:18,157
Aubrey.

116
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,994
Aubrey, can you hear me?

117
00:28:21,996 --> 00:28:23,929
Can you hear me, Aubrey?

118
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:24,733
Aubrey?

119
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,068
Can you hear me?

120
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:29,268
Yes.

121
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,770
Yes, yes, I can hear you.

122
00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:32,004
Listen to me carefully

123
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:33,272
and do exactly as I say.

124
00:28:33,274 --> 00:28:35,240
I don't know what
the fuck is going on.

125
00:28:35,242 --> 00:28:36,576
Close your eyes.

126
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:39,679
Take the walkie and
face it toward the door.

127
00:28:39,681 --> 00:28:40,946
What?

128
00:28:40,948 --> 00:28:43,849
Face
it toward the door.

129
00:28:43,851 --> 00:28:45,184
Okay.

130
00:28:45,186 --> 00:28:46,187
Fuck.

131
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:51,090
Stand up.

132
00:28:52,627 --> 00:28:53,628
Stand up.

133
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:00,099
Walk toward the door.

134
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:02,470
Aubrey, keep your eyes closed.

135
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:07,875
Walk toward the door.

136
00:30:02,463 --> 00:30:04,532
Well, that's encouraging.

137
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:06,868
What is?

138
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:09,268
You want to live.

139
00:30:17,378 --> 00:30:18,446
What?

140
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,881
What the fuck is going on?

141
00:30:22,883 --> 00:30:24,216
You're
going to want to go

142
00:30:24,218 --> 00:30:26,787
back upstairs now,
and lock the door.

143
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:42,303
It's going to be okay, Aubrey.

144
00:30:43,504 --> 00:30:45,571
How do you know my name?

145
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:48,140
I knew Grace.

146
00:30:48,142 --> 00:30:50,409
Now, I need you not
to be scared, Aubrey.

147
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:52,411
I need you not to panic.

148
00:30:52,413 --> 00:30:53,846
I know exactly
how you're feeling

149
00:30:53,848 --> 00:30:57,216
but we can help each
other, I promise you.

150
00:30:57,218 --> 00:30:58,484
I think there's a way
out of this, Aubrey.

151
00:30:58,486 --> 00:31:00,488
Hey, stop saying my name.

152
00:31:04,057 --> 00:31:05,357
How did you do that?

153
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,158
Do what?

154
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,392
Before, in the diner.

155
00:31:07,394 --> 00:31:08,727
It was like a
signal or something.

156
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:11,830
You did some kind of signal
and you made it leave.

157
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:13,665
It was the signal.

158
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:15,334
It caused all of this.

159
00:31:15,336 --> 00:31:16,935
Would you just tell me
what the fuck is going on?

160
00:31:16,937 --> 00:31:17,736
Do
you have to understand

161
00:31:17,738 --> 00:31:19,103
everything to accept it?

162
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:20,839
You're not
answering my question!

163
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:22,441
That's because
you're not listening yet.

164
00:31:22,443 --> 00:31:23,542
Okay, well, what did you mean

165
00:31:23,544 --> 00:31:26,712
when you said that we
could help each other?

166
00:31:26,714 --> 00:31:27,746
The
final part of the signal

167
00:31:27,748 --> 00:31:29,915
was transmitted last night.

168
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:34,386
It caused all of this,
the snow, the monoliths.

169
00:31:34,388 --> 00:31:36,557
Look, Grace found something.

170
00:31:38,392 --> 00:31:40,759
It's in the apartment with you.

171
00:31:40,761 --> 00:31:42,463
What do you mean?

172
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:46,398
What did she find?

173
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,405
She left
it for you, the first part.

174
00:31:52,473 --> 00:31:53,472
Hey, there are people out there,

175
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:54,773
and I think that
they need our help.

176
00:31:54,775 --> 00:31:56,240
You
can't help them, Aubrey.

177
00:31:56,242 --> 00:31:59,545
- But they need our help!
- Stop, Aubrey.

178
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:06,718
What the fuck is happening?

179
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,220
What the fuck is happening?!

180
00:32:09,222 --> 00:32:11,790
I need to go.

181
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:13,492
Please don't go.

182
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:17,462
Please don't go, please
don't go, please don't go.

183
00:32:17,464 --> 00:32:18,499
Please don't go.

184
00:32:31,612 --> 00:32:32,646
Maybe I'm dead.

185
00:33:55,662 --> 00:33:57,762
This makes me
cringe talking into this,

186
00:33:57,764 --> 00:34:00,564
listening to my stupid voice.

187
00:34:00,566 --> 00:34:02,934
You were always so much
better at this than me.

188
00:34:02,936 --> 00:34:05,937
Anyways, I'm not sure when
I'm sending this to you,

189
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:08,572
if I send this to you.

190
00:34:08,574 --> 00:34:11,709
But, I figure you'll
be the only one

191
00:34:11,711 --> 00:34:14,880
to take this remotely seriously.

192
00:34:14,882 --> 00:34:19,719
I trust you to help me, or to
tell me I'm being an idiot.

193
00:34:22,422 --> 00:34:25,425
Someone found
something, this group.

194
00:34:26,526 --> 00:34:29,527
They uncovered some signal.

195
00:34:29,529 --> 00:34:31,896
It was buried in a
radio transmission

196
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:34,933
and there have been
others, I mean before.

197
00:34:34,935 --> 00:34:38,769
We started to find them in
all sorts of transmissions.

198
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:40,304
It's what I've been working on.

199
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:41,739
I'm trying to help them.

200
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:46,746
It started as just fun,
conspiracy bullshit, you know.

201
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,749
Oh, Aubrey, there's
a correlation

202
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:55,720
between events, disasters,
natural disasters.

203
00:34:55,722 --> 00:34:57,655
The patterns repeat.

204
00:34:57,657 --> 00:35:00,991
They seem to form a chain of
signals that link together

205
00:35:00,993 --> 00:35:04,430
in a loop, but we're
missing one: seven.

206
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:09,635
We have the rest, or
I have the rest and ..

207
00:35:11,171 --> 00:35:14,805
I mean, we think the signal
is only dangerous fragmented,

208
00:35:14,807 --> 00:35:18,176
like computer code,
in pieces it corrupts,

209
00:35:18,178 --> 00:35:20,480
but put it all together...

210
00:35:21,581 --> 00:35:23,080
There are people after it.

211
00:35:23,082 --> 00:35:24,749
It's all fucked up, Aubrey,

212
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:27,019
and I'm a little scared...

213
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:29,088
and excited.

214
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,091
I'm hiding the rest
of the tapes, okay?

215
00:35:34,093 --> 00:35:36,260
Where we used to go.

216
00:35:36,262 --> 00:35:38,629
You'll figure it out.

217
00:35:38,631 --> 00:35:39,632
I hope.

218
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,601
I buried each signal in songs.

219
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:45,336
It seemed apt.

220
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:47,972
I hope you enjoy them at least.

221
00:35:47,974 --> 00:35:50,040
It's been a while since we made

222
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:52,645
each other mix tapes, hasn't it?

223
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,981
I miss it.

224
00:35:56,015 --> 00:36:00,050
If nothing else, it'll
make a great mix tape

225
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:02,887
for the next road trip we take.

226
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:05,656
I feel stupid talking to
you like this right now.

227
00:36:05,658 --> 00:36:06,626
Where are you?

228
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:11,731
You should ring me
more often, stupid.

229
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:14,865
I have to go back
to the hospital

230
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:16,667
tomorrow for some more tests.

231
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,675
It's the strangest thing,

232
00:36:23,643 --> 00:36:26,712
not being able to
trust your own body.

233
00:36:29,248 --> 00:36:30,650
I need to get out.

234
00:36:35,555 --> 00:36:37,723
But it feels good, you know?

235
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:40,560
To have a secret.

236
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:18,143
Aubrey, pick up.

237
00:40:20,145 --> 00:40:21,811
You left me.

238
00:40:21,813 --> 00:40:23,579
I had to.

239
00:40:23,581 --> 00:40:25,715
You had to see for yourself.

240
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:27,451
You played the signal, right?

241
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:29,752
You have to be careful.

242
00:40:29,754 --> 00:40:31,422
The signal is very powerful.

243
00:40:31,424 --> 00:40:33,058
It opens doorways.

244
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:36,493
I think the creatures...

245
00:40:36,495 --> 00:40:38,261
I think they came through
one of these doorways,

246
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:40,263
but they also seem scared of it.

247
00:40:40,265 --> 00:40:42,433
Is everyone gone?

248
00:40:42,435 --> 00:40:43,467
Or hiding.

249
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:44,569
I don't know.

250
00:40:46,104 --> 00:40:47,105
My mom?

251
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:52,577
My dad?

252
00:40:58,283 --> 00:41:00,183
How come you're alive?

253
00:41:00,185 --> 00:41:01,284
I told you.

254
00:41:01,286 --> 00:41:02,585
I knew Grace.

255
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:04,954
We were helping each other.

256
00:41:04,956 --> 00:41:07,759
But she's dead now, isn't she?

257
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:11,961
Tell me what you think it is.

258
00:41:11,963 --> 00:41:15,498
I don't know
exactly, but we have ideas.

259
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,999
The signal might be
a natural pattern,

260
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:21,104
something older than us,
something necessary, repeating.

261
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:24,440
It could be manmade,
a new kind of warfare,

262
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:26,042
something we don't
know about yet.

263
00:41:26,044 --> 00:41:27,345
It could be...

264
00:41:28,546 --> 00:41:30,046
just coincidental, a pattern

265
00:41:30,048 --> 00:41:33,118
simply because we
want to see one.

266
00:41:35,854 --> 00:41:38,688
Tell me what you
really think it is.

267
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,624
What if
it isn't random, the signal?

268
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:44,026
Transmitting for decades
buried in our transmissions,

269
00:41:44,028 --> 00:41:47,866
repeating, looping,
echoing the same pieces,

270
00:41:50,068 --> 00:41:52,668
waiting to transmit
in the right order

271
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,671
to make a chain of code.

272
00:41:56,207 --> 00:41:57,240
Maybe all science doesn't need

273
00:41:57,242 --> 00:42:00,009
to be based on the same systems.

274
00:42:00,011 --> 00:42:01,544
Maybe there is something,
something out there,

275
00:42:01,546 --> 00:42:05,014
that uses sound waves as the
foundation of its science,

276
00:42:05,016 --> 00:42:07,750
sound waves used not
just for communication,

277
00:42:07,752 --> 00:42:11,053
but for interaction,
for warfare,

278
00:42:11,055 --> 00:42:13,258
for exploration, for travel,

279
00:42:15,692 --> 00:42:17,362
for opening doorways.

280
00:42:18,396 --> 00:42:20,198
What if the signal...

281
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:26,035
is them trying to
come across to us?

282
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:37,413
When I first came
here I didn't know

283
00:42:37,415 --> 00:42:41,419
what I was looking for
or what I was hoping for,

284
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,024
but you know what
used to be my dream?

285
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:50,861
My absolute favorite fantasy...

286
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:55,531
was for everyone
to just disappear,

287
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:59,404
for the world to just be
devoid of distraction,

288
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:03,474
empty shells of empty lives,

289
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:05,776
empty cities,

290
00:43:07,478 --> 00:43:08,646
empty streets,

291
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:12,116
just trees...

292
00:43:14,118 --> 00:43:15,119
and brick.

293
00:43:17,788 --> 00:43:22,093
Grace said that she trusted
me to decide what to do.

294
00:43:23,228 --> 00:43:25,161
Aubrey.

295
00:43:25,163 --> 00:43:26,231
Aubrey?

296
00:43:27,165 --> 00:43:29,131
Aubrey, you have to help.

297
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:31,234
We have to stop it.

298
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:32,270
Aubrey!

299
00:43:33,137 --> 00:43:35,072
Aubrey, listen to me!

300
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:37,242
Aubrey!

301
00:43:50,154 --> 00:43:52,622
You might think that being in
this forced close proximity

302
00:43:52,624 --> 00:43:55,090
means that we're going
to become great friends.

303
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:56,461
Don't count on it.

304
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:16,314
The home for everyone is to
him his castle and fortress,

305
00:44:17,814 --> 00:44:20,652
as well for his defense
against injury and violence,

306
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:24,154
as for his repose.

307
00:44:32,229 --> 00:44:37,234
I wonder if the world still
exists if I choose to ignore it.

308
00:47:02,345 --> 00:47:06,448
Whenever I find myself
growing grim about the mouth;

309
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:10,819
whenever it is a damp,
drizzly November in my soul;

310
00:47:10,821 --> 00:47:12,353
whenever I find
myself involuntarily

311
00:47:12,355 --> 00:47:15,023
pausing before
coffin warehouses,

312
00:47:15,025 --> 00:47:18,526
and bringing up the rear
of every funeral I meet;

313
00:47:18,528 --> 00:47:23,467
I account it is high time to
get to sea as soon as I can.

314
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

315
00:49:04,935 --> 00:49:06,734
It's official.

316
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:08,337
We're out of food.

317
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:11,508
We're almost out of water,

318
00:49:13,009 --> 00:49:17,246
and sooner or later we're
going to run out of batteries.

319
00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:22,519
I'm open to any suggestions.

320
00:49:27,456 --> 00:49:28,491
Yeah.

321
00:49:29,693 --> 00:49:31,493
Maybe I don't want to.

322
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:35,964
Oh, fuck you.

323
00:49:35,966 --> 00:49:38,100
I'm allowed to be scared.

324
00:49:42,338 --> 00:49:43,138
Yeah.

325
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:47,811
Yeah, I know.

326
00:50:02,993 --> 00:50:04,859
This makes me
cringe talking into this,

327
00:50:04,861 --> 00:50:07,862
listening to my stupid voice.

328
00:50:07,864 --> 00:50:10,163
You were always so much
better at this than me.

329
00:50:10,165 --> 00:50:13,233
Anyways, I'm not sure when
I'm sending this to you,

330
00:50:13,235 --> 00:50:15,569
if I send this to you.

331
00:50:15,571 --> 00:50:18,538
But I figure you'll
be the only one

332
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,843
to take this remotely seriously.

333
00:50:21,845 --> 00:50:25,481
I trust...

334
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,220
The patterns repeat.

335
00:50:33,222 --> 00:50:34,756
They seem to form
a chain of signals

336
00:50:34,758 --> 00:50:37,892
that link together in a loop,

337
00:50:37,894 --> 00:50:40,429
but we're missing one: seven.

338
00:50:41,697 --> 00:50:45,267
We have the rest, or I
have the rest and...

339
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,669
I mean, we think the
signal is only dangerous...

340
00:50:51,373 --> 00:50:52,874
And excited.

341
00:50:52,876 --> 00:50:57,011
So, I'm hiding the rest
of the tapes, okay?

342
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:59,080
Where we used to go.

343
00:50:59,082 --> 00:51:01,381
You'll figure it out.

344
00:51:01,383 --> 00:51:02,384
I hope.

345
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,520
I've buried each
signal in songs.

346
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,122
It seemed apt.

347
00:51:08,124 --> 00:51:11,591
I hope you enjoy them at least.

348
00:51:11,593 --> 00:51:15,029
She kept listening to
it over and over again.

349
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:16,099
On her walks.

350
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,600
Around town.

351
00:51:19,936 --> 00:51:22,369
You built something.

352
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:23,637
You built something, didn't you?

353
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:28,577
Something that could recognize
the signal, and it did,

354
00:51:29,411 --> 00:51:30,546
the night that I arrived.

355
00:51:32,648 --> 00:51:37,653
Seven tapes, one you gave me,
seven you hadn't finished yet.

356
00:51:38,787 --> 00:51:40,923
That was the final piece.

357
00:52:10,853 --> 00:52:11,820
Okay, Grace.

358
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,158
You get one chance.

359
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:17,958
Let's try it your way.

360
00:52:29,805 --> 00:52:33,809
So we can protect ourselves,
only if we have to.

361
01:00:07,094 --> 01:00:08,128
Wake up!

362
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

363
01:05:31,584 --> 01:05:36,554
Want to know the saddest thing
about everybody being gone?

364
01:05:36,556 --> 01:05:38,724
Everybody being dead I mean.

365
01:05:41,394 --> 01:05:43,094
All the lost stories.

366
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:45,563
People are going to die anyways,

367
01:05:45,565 --> 01:05:48,133
but their stories don't have to.

368
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

369
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:20,645
Hey.

370
01:09:26,217 --> 01:09:27,218
Hey.

371
01:09:28,953 --> 01:09:31,356
How have you been?

372
01:09:34,559 --> 01:09:36,461
I have these dreams...

373
01:09:37,962 --> 01:09:41,731
where you talk to me,
like you're still here.

374
01:09:41,733 --> 01:09:43,468
I'm here.

375
01:09:44,636 --> 01:09:46,004
How have you been?

376
01:09:48,573 --> 01:09:51,576
I can't feel my
fingers sometimes.

377
01:09:52,811 --> 01:09:55,046
It's called disassociation.

378
01:09:56,214 --> 01:09:58,714
You're pulling away
from the world.

379
01:09:58,716 --> 01:09:59,751
Why?

380
01:10:02,487 --> 01:10:04,887
Because I can't
forgive myself.

381
01:10:04,889 --> 01:10:06,591
What for?

382
01:10:08,425 --> 01:10:09,559
Is this real?

383
01:10:09,561 --> 01:10:11,663
I'm dead, stupid.

384
01:10:13,231 --> 01:10:17,836
I mean all this, everything
that's happening, is it real?

385
01:10:19,504 --> 01:10:22,705
Do you
want it to be real?

386
01:10:22,707 --> 01:10:24,907
I didn't want to
leave the apartment.

387
01:10:24,909 --> 01:10:25,910
Why?

388
01:10:27,879 --> 01:10:30,880
Because I didn't
want you to be gone.

389
01:10:30,882 --> 01:10:31,747
But I am gone.

390
01:10:31,749 --> 01:10:33,117
I can't do that.

391
01:10:34,118 --> 01:10:37,220
I don't think I can do that.

392
01:10:37,222 --> 01:10:39,789
You have to do
what makes you happy.

393
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:43,358
If you're not happy, you
can't make anybody else happy.

394
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,727
- I told you that before.
- I don't believe that.

395
01:10:44,729 --> 01:10:45,962
I think that you're wrong.

396
01:10:45,964 --> 01:10:46,729
Well, you're
not dead, are you?

397
01:10:46,731 --> 01:10:48,465
So what do you know?

398
01:10:49,801 --> 01:10:54,404
What if making someone else
happy is what makes you happy?

399
01:10:57,709 --> 01:11:00,309
Why haven't
you taken it off?

400
01:11:00,311 --> 01:11:01,744
I can't.

401
01:11:01,746 --> 01:11:02,714
Why?

402
01:11:04,749 --> 01:11:09,721
Because it's a reminder
of everything bad I've done,

403
01:11:10,955 --> 01:11:13,923
of how much that I
have to make up for.

404
01:11:13,925 --> 01:11:16,125
But you can't
make up for it, can you?

405
01:11:16,127 --> 01:11:17,459
No.

406
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:18,761
So what
are you going to do?

407
01:11:18,763 --> 01:11:20,162
I don't know.

408
01:11:20,164 --> 01:11:21,764
Can you tell me?

409
01:11:21,766 --> 01:11:23,732
Can you please tell me?

410
01:11:23,734 --> 01:11:26,002
Be happy.

411
01:11:26,004 --> 01:11:27,005
I can't.

412
01:11:28,006 --> 01:11:29,638
I'm suffocated.

413
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,842
You cheated.

414
01:11:37,248 --> 01:11:38,580
I cheated.

415
01:11:38,582 --> 01:11:41,750
You have
to live with that.

416
01:11:41,752 --> 01:11:43,754
You have to confront it.

417
01:11:47,859 --> 01:11:48,825
Stop...

418
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,727
hiding.

419
01:11:53,764 --> 01:11:57,133
I can still remember
the sound of the waves

420
01:11:57,135 --> 01:11:59,137
and the sand on my palm.

421
01:12:00,537 --> 01:12:02,939
We're just people,

422
01:12:02,941 --> 01:12:06,275
wandering around,
bumping into each other.

423
01:12:06,277 --> 01:12:07,245
No.

424
01:12:08,346 --> 01:12:09,513
No, we aren't.

425
01:12:11,448 --> 01:12:13,515
So what are you going to do?

426
01:12:13,517 --> 01:12:15,552
I'm going to stay here.

427
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,155
And I'm going to never leave.

428
01:12:19,157 --> 01:12:20,857
Sounds like a plan.

429
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,500
I'm so sorry.

430
01:12:31,568 --> 01:12:33,037
For what?

431
01:12:35,239 --> 01:12:37,874
For not being there for you.

432
01:12:42,045 --> 01:12:43,878
When you...

433
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,350
When you needed me.

434
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:49,153
You were always there for me.

435
01:12:51,922 --> 01:12:54,923
I wasn't fucking
there for you,

436
01:12:54,925 --> 01:12:58,927
and I should have been
there for you and I wasn't.

437
01:12:58,929 --> 01:12:59,830
I'm so sorry.

438
01:13:01,765 --> 01:13:03,732
I didn't know.

439
01:13:03,734 --> 01:13:04,935
I didn't know.

440
01:13:05,869 --> 01:13:07,205
Yes, you did.

441
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:10,574
Please forgive me.

442
01:13:16,046 --> 01:13:17,881
I just want to go home.

443
01:13:19,049 --> 01:13:20,951
I just want to go home.

444
01:17:34,271 --> 01:17:36,271
Yeah, no, that's
actually true though.

445
01:17:36,273 --> 01:17:38,171
Yeah, that's a very accurate
drawing right there.

446
01:21:45,921 --> 01:21:48,557
Let's go on a walk, Bellini.

447
01:24:17,571 --> 01:24:20,205
This is ridiculous,
that you're here.

448
01:24:20,207 --> 01:24:21,273
You know that right?

449
01:24:21,275 --> 01:24:22,710
It's ridiculous.

450
01:24:26,714 --> 01:24:28,884
Just ash, dirt, fucking ash.

451
01:24:38,526 --> 01:24:39,892
If you can hear me I'm
guessing that you already know

452
01:24:39,894 --> 01:24:44,532
everything that's happened,
so I'm not going to bore you.

453
01:26:05,646 --> 01:26:06,645
I got the message.

454
01:26:06,647 --> 01:26:07,648
Don't worry.

455
01:26:40,815 --> 01:26:41,782
Okay.

456
01:27:23,356 --> 01:27:27,391
Welcome back
to Sparrow 103, your local...

457
01:27:27,393 --> 01:27:28,361
Fuck.

458
01:27:29,562 --> 01:27:30,530
Oh, fuck.

459
01:29:10,397 --> 01:29:11,365
Hello?

460
01:29:17,037 --> 01:29:18,004
Hello?

461
01:29:24,677 --> 01:29:26,746
My name is Aubrey Parker,

462
01:29:28,415 --> 01:29:29,383
and...

463
01:29:31,517 --> 01:29:34,921
I think I might be
the last person left.

464
01:29:36,656 --> 01:29:37,824
I don't know...

465
01:29:40,026 --> 01:29:42,827
I don't know if I
did anything to fix

466
01:29:42,829 --> 01:29:45,332
what's going to happen, but...

467
01:29:46,933 --> 01:29:49,068
I really hope that I did.

468
01:29:52,872 --> 01:29:53,840
So...

469
01:29:55,041 --> 01:29:57,844
If there's anybody
else out there,

470
01:30:01,114 --> 01:30:03,950
now's the time to say something.

471
01:30:08,021 --> 01:30:08,988
Hello?

472
01:30:10,923 --> 01:30:11,958
Anybody?

473
01:30:16,929 --> 01:30:17,930
Please.

474
01:30:21,067 --> 01:30:22,068
Please.

475
01:30:37,884 --> 01:30:39,384
Hello?

476
01:30:39,386 --> 01:30:41,085
Oh my god!

477
01:30:41,087 --> 01:30:43,087
Oh my god, can you hear me?

478
01:30:43,089 --> 01:30:43,988
Yes.

479
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:45,556
- We can hear you.
- Holy shit!

480
01:30:45,558 --> 01:30:47,091
Are you okay?

481
01:30:47,093 --> 01:30:48,592
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm safe.

482
01:30:48,594 --> 01:30:50,161
I'm safe, I'm at
the radio station.

483
01:30:50,163 --> 01:30:51,463
Did you say we?

484
01:30:51,465 --> 01:30:53,998
There's a few of us.

485
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,301
Why would you think
you were alone?

486
01:30:57,303 --> 01:31:00,439
Well, I just, I
thought that I'd been

487
01:31:00,441 --> 01:31:01,906
alone this entire time.

488
01:31:01,908 --> 01:31:03,607
I didn't realize.

489
01:31:03,609 --> 01:31:04,909
Why are
you at the radio station?

490
01:31:04,911 --> 01:31:06,243
Wait, how do I know
that you're real?

491
01:31:06,245 --> 01:31:08,112
We're real.

492
01:31:08,114 --> 01:31:09,914
I figured it
out, I stopped it.

493
01:31:09,916 --> 01:31:11,115
Figured what out?

494
01:31:11,117 --> 01:31:12,349
The signal?

495
01:31:12,351 --> 01:31:14,652
You know about the signal?

496
01:31:14,654 --> 01:31:16,454
We know about it.

497
01:31:16,456 --> 01:31:17,788
Well, yeah.

498
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:19,023
I found all the pieces
and I put them together.

499
01:31:19,025 --> 01:31:21,158
I sent the reply
so it's okay now.

500
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,029
I closed all the doors.

501
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:31,302
So you
took the message they sent,

502
01:31:31,304 --> 01:31:34,140
the one that caused all of this,

503
01:31:35,108 --> 01:31:38,144
you put it back
together for them,

504
01:31:38,978 --> 01:31:40,980
not knowing what it was,

505
01:31:42,949 --> 01:31:43,950
what it did,

506
01:31:46,018 --> 01:31:46,953
and you...

507
01:31:48,321 --> 01:31:50,022
and you sent it back?

508
01:31:55,561 --> 01:31:58,131
You shouldn't have done that.

509
01:32:03,002 --> 01:32:05,037
You didn't close the doors.

510
01:32:08,841 --> 01:32:09,976
You opened them.

511
01:32:13,513 --> 01:32:14,514
Aubrey.

512
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:18,151
Aubrey.

513
01:32:20,987 --> 01:32:21,988
Pick up!

514
01:32:23,089 --> 01:32:24,056
Aubrey!

515
01:32:25,525 --> 01:32:26,492
Aubrey!

516
01:32:28,427 --> 01:32:31,328
She's at the radio station!
