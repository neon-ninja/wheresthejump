00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:58,568
Hey. Dad, Dad.

3
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:00,603
Hey, what's up?

4
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:03,573
Sheppard's falling behind again.
He's exhausted, showed up late,

5
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:05,173
putting the rest of the guys
in danger.

6
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:08,110
- Well, his brother's sick.
- He's a good kid, but one man

7
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:09,779
doesn't take precedent
over the team.

8
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:11,147
Let me talk to him.

9
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:12,813
I'm gonna have to let him go.

10
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:15,117
Dad, you just said so yourself,
he's a good kid.

11
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:17,185
Come on,
just let me talk to him.

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Go get your tools.
I'll meet you in the truck.

13
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:28,294
Ah! Dad!

14
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:30,796
- Eric?
- Please! Please! Help me! Dad!

15
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,699
Eric! Eric!

16
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:36,602
- Dad! Dad!
- What the fuck?

17
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:38,937
I got you, I got you.

18
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:42,206
Dad! Please. Dad. Dad.

19
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,909
Dad!

20
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:51,881
Dad!
Please, please, help me, Dad.

21
00:02:53,283 --> 00:02:55,351
- Dad!
- Eric!

22
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:58,721
Eric.

23
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:03,124
Eric!

24
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,196
Dad!

25
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:02,228
<i>Hello, Arianne.</i>

26
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:05,031
<i>It's Darren Atkins again.</i>

27
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:06,766
<i>The team and I
are all set for the trip,</i>

28
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,168
<i>our gear is ready,</i>

29
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,935
<i>and we packed
as light as possible,</i>

30
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,971
<i>so we're only bringing
essential equipment.</i>

31
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:15,773
<i>Okay.
I'm excited to get going,</i>

32
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:18,343
<i>and looking forward
to meeting you in person.</i>

33
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:20,078
<i>Thank you.</i>

34
00:06:19,563 --> 00:06:21,765
Are we close?

35
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:42,317
- All right, excuse me. What?
- Come on, man,

36
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,819
- let the woman drive.
- I'm letting her drive.

37
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:46,853
We exited the freeway
four hours ago.

38
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:48,923
Okay, none of these roads
are on the maps.

39
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:50,992
We don't have any signal.
I just...

40
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:52,792
Want to continually attack
her professionalism.

41
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:55,561
Well?

42
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:57,130
Is there anything I could do

43
00:06:57,162 --> 00:06:59,198
to maybe facilitate
your driving?

44
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:02,101
You could shut up, amigo.

45
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:04,869
Okay. Hey, look, this isn't
meant to be a criticism,

46
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:07,239
but how do you know
where we're going?

47
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:10,808
I was raised by wolves.

48
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:14,545
Sarcasm is gonna get us there
quicker.

49
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:16,246
You know, I'm curious,
Arianne,

50
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,816
how many of the expeditions
you've aided

51
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,585
have had
a scientific objective?

52
00:07:21,618 --> 00:07:23,387
With all due respect, sir,

53
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:25,988
I don't discuss my clients
with other clients.

54
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:29,959
I hope you'll consider that
an asset.

55
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,294
Yes, of course.

56
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,561
Although I hope
that this will be an expedition

57
00:07:33,595 --> 00:07:37,398
we will all want to talk about
for years to come.

58
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:40,801
I'm just here to get you
to where you need to go.

59
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:43,837
Fair enough.

60
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,627
This looks promising.

61
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:12,128
Maybe we can get a postcard.

62
00:08:17,032 --> 00:08:19,534
I'm getting hungry.
Anyone else getting hungry?

63
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:35,949
Wait here, I won't be long.

64
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,484
Copy.

65
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,955
You okay?

66
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,524
All right.

67
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:23,157
Excuse me, sir.

68
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:27,962
I'd like to buy some water
for the five of us

69
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:31,199
and some coolant for the car,
if you have it?

70
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,936
Also,
I'm looking for directions.

71
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,538
We've been tracking the river
for a couple of hours

72
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:41,572
past Peaks Mill, South Pike.

73
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:45,009
But I can't seem to find
where I need to go.

74
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,544
Where'd that be?

75
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:48,979
Shookum Hills.

76
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:53,551
I ain't never heard of it.

77
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:54,953
Old mountain town,

78
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:56,286
used to be around here

79
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:58,522
until it burned down
to the ground,

80
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:00,291
back in the '70s.

81
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:04,459
I'm working off an atlas
from 1972 out there,

82
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:07,496
and on any map after that
it seems like the town

83
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:10,399
was literally
wiped off the face of the earth.

84
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:14,435
Any help you could offer
will be much appreciated.

85
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:18,173
You go back
the way you came.

86
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:19,974
You'll reach the freeway.

87
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:23,743
Stay on that
till you get back to your city.

88
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:26,047
You'll be fine.

89
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:31,685
Great.

90
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,988
Thanks.

91
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:50,067
Dale. We've got a problem.

92
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:51,433
So?

93
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:52,668
We're close.

94
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,269
- Let's go.
- All right.

95
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:56,472
Well it's about time.

96
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:03,045
Did they have any food in there?

97
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:17,992
We should go back.

98
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:20,660
What's that, Shawn?

99
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,429
It's not here.

100
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:24,330
Let's go back.

101
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:27,065
The fact it's not
here is the reason we are.

102
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:28,501
We shouldn't be here.

103
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:31,203
Right.

104
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:35,673
Right, we should go back.
We should throw two years

105
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:37,274
- of research...
- Hang on.

106
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:39,710
What are you doing?

107
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:41,478
- Hey!
- Jesus! What the fuck!

108
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,645
We're not alone.

109
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:47,416
- Friendly escort?
- Not likely.

110
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,718
Hold on.

111
00:11:50,518 --> 00:11:52,421
Hey, slow down.

112
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:54,323
- Come on, slow down!
- Hang on.

113
00:11:54,355 --> 00:11:56,624
No, I'm serious,
slow the fuck down!

114
00:11:57,724 --> 00:11:59,660
Can you lose them?

115
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:09,135
- I'm being serious.
- Relax.

116
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:11,504
- We're going too fast.
- Slow down!

117
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:12,773
She's got this.

118
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:21,279
Nice driving, Arianne.

119
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,492
Are you trying
to get us killed?

120
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:36,860
Doing what I'm paid to do.

121
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:38,728
You paying her
to get us killed?

122
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:41,432
It's fine, she knows
what she's doing, all right?

123
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,169
There you go.

124
00:12:47,202 --> 00:12:48,770
What was that?

125
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:50,606
That was an escort.

126
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,341
They wanted to push us past one
very specific point in the road.

127
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,443
All right,
so what are you saying?

128
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,879
That spot where he slowed down,

129
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:00,714
that's where we need to go.

130
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,758
It should be close.

131
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,694
Look for openings
and sidetracks.

132
00:13:19,863 --> 00:13:21,232
Guys, look.

133
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:23,234
Up there to the right.

134
00:14:05,571 --> 00:14:07,273
This is it.

135
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,342
Stop. Don't touch it.

136
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,509
It's electrified.

137
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:16,881
All right.

138
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,389
Darren.

139
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:28,723
Why put up an electric fence
in the middle of nowhere?

140
00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:30,193
They want to keep us out.

141
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:31,826
This doesn't feel right.

142
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:34,596
We need to find
our way around this gate.

143
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,199
Those branches
are too thin to climb.

144
00:14:37,232 --> 00:14:39,733
Or your ass is too big.

145
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:41,703
Really, man?
Six percent body fat.

146
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:44,871
Yeah, right.
How do you know that?

147
00:14:44,904 --> 00:14:46,774
Hey, Arianne?

148
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:10,595
Let's go.

149
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:17,787
This is a good spot, guys.

150
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,954
So, what do we have
to worry about out here?

151
00:16:19,988 --> 00:16:21,957
Is this shit like quicksand
or what?

152
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:23,591
A sinkhole...

153
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:26,695
is formed when
an underground cavity collapses.

154
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:29,297
They've been known

155
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:30,530
to swallow livestock,

156
00:16:30,564 --> 00:16:32,400
people, cars, even houses.

157
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:35,735
Many were formed by coal seams
that catch fire

158
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:38,404
and collapse
as the coal smolders.

159
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:40,939
- So that's what happened here?
- No, we don't know yet.

160
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:42,708
There are hundreds
of coal seam fires

161
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:43,975
throughout the world.

162
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:46,312
Some were ignited
through natural processes.

163
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:49,782
Others were brought on by men
in mining accidents.

164
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:52,917
And then
there's Shookum Hills.

165
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,787
We know there was a fire,
but not what caused it,

166
00:16:56,821 --> 00:16:58,988
We know there was a town here,
not why it vanished.

167
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:02,658
- And we know there were miners.
- If they were miners.

168
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:03,859
And I'm out.

169
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:05,728
- Really?
- What do you mean if?

170
00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:08,663
Here we go.

171
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,065
Well, the prevailing theory

172
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:13,368
is that this was never
actually a coal mine,

173
00:17:13,402 --> 00:17:16,471
but America's response
to the Well to Hell.

174
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,742
The Kola Borehole
in Siberia.

175
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:23,644
The Russians
decided to drill

176
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,611
the deepest borehole
in the world

177
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,647
- and they did, supposedly.
- Okay.

178
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:29,549
They dug 8 miles
straight down

179
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,950
until the drill broke.

180
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:33,418
Then they lowered
a heat resistant microphone

181
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:37,356
into the well
where they recorded this sound.

182
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:50,533
What the hell was that?

183
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:53,770
Some say
it's the screams of the damned.

184
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:57,040
Echoes, distorted echoes

185
00:17:57,072 --> 00:18:00,110
of slight underground grinding
of tectonic plates,

186
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:02,678
happens everywhere lithosphere
is disrupted by mining.

187
00:18:02,711 --> 00:18:05,680
A natural reaction
to a natural invasive procedure.

188
00:18:05,714 --> 00:18:07,549
So the theory
is the American government

189
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:10,718
decided to drill their own well
here at Shookum Hills.

190
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:13,988
And now everyone is gone.

191
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:15,990
The whole place is gone.

192
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:18,392
Right, so, what you really need
to worry about

193
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:20,694
is not whether this shit
is like quicksand,

194
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,896
but rather that key members
of this expedition

195
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:25,798
continue to discard fundamental
scientific principles

196
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:27,766
and throw all reason
out the window.

197
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,467
I am not discarding science.

198
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:30,668
- Oh, no?
- I am just trying

199
00:18:30,702 --> 00:18:32,637
to embrace the notion

200
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:33,972
that folklore, myth,
religion

201
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:36,039
all stem from a merger
between science

202
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,877
and, you know,
actual human experience.

203
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,012
That idea might have grown
from a combination

204
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:42,946
of myth and fact.

205
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:45,047
- Yeah.
- Just like intelligent design

206
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,184
is not a concept
that disregards the big bang.

207
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:50,887
It just keeps us open
to the possibility

208
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,522
that God created it.

209
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:54,623
Except he didn't, Shawn.
A rapid disruption

210
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:57,192
of the primordial singularity
did 15 billion years ago.

211
00:18:57,226 --> 00:18:59,461
- So you say.
- So science says.

212
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:01,129
Christ, what is this?
Sophomore philosophy class?

213
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:05,167
Christ.
Also, real guy, myth, both?

214
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:08,669
- Mom and Dad are fighting again.
- They need counseling.

215
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:10,203
I'm not having
this conversation.

216
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:12,172
You seem to know what happened,
tell us.

217
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:14,475
It's obvious,
an environmental disaster.

218
00:19:14,507 --> 00:19:15,908
And we're not here
to find hell.

219
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:18,877
We're here
to find holes and smoke.

220
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,746
Hmm. So basically hell, then.

221
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,115
Thank you, guys, very much
for clearing that up.

222
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:25,484
I'm sorry I asked.

223
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,534
How long?

224
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:46,703
I don't know.

225
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:51,106
Did someone cut the wire?

226
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,211
Not cut.

227
00:19:57,244 --> 00:19:58,712
It's torn.

228
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:05,718
What? Like a fucking animal
chew on it or something?

229
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:06,953
I don't think so.

230
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:08,589
It's been pulled.

231
00:20:08,622 --> 00:20:09,989
Stripped from inside.

232
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:12,924
At least the grating held.

233
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,627
What's the voltage?

234
00:20:16,895 --> 00:20:19,196
Apparently not enough.

235
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>Cain,
they're trying to get out. Check your zone.</i>

236
00:20:56,896 --> 00:20:58,831
Yes, ma'am, I'm on it.

237
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:00,567
Closing in on to 16 and 18,

238
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:03,002
I'll check in when I'm done.
Over.

239
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:24,954
I hear you, devil.

240
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

241
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

242
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:19,869
That's my knife.

243
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:23,906
Okay.

244
00:22:25,008 --> 00:22:26,808
Just don't like anyone else

245
00:22:26,842 --> 00:22:28,277
- touching it.
- I get it.

246
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:30,913
I feel the same way
about my PlayStation.

247
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:35,383
No, you don't.

248
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:37,952
- Have a good night.
- Good night.

249
00:22:42,123 --> 00:22:44,123
Hey, hey.

250
00:22:44,157 --> 00:22:45,359
Hey.

251
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:48,828
So, Darren.

252
00:22:48,862 --> 00:22:50,763
Yeah?

253
00:22:50,795 --> 00:22:53,833
Where did you find her?

254
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:57,069
A colleague of mine,

255
00:22:57,102 --> 00:22:59,704
he did a dig with her
in Tanzania.

256
00:22:59,736 --> 00:23:02,673
Worst personality ever,
he said.

257
00:23:02,707 --> 00:23:05,709
Arrogant, self-absorbed.

258
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:07,911
But she got him
where he needed to go.

259
00:23:07,944 --> 00:23:09,413
She worked in Africa, huh?

260
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:11,180
Yeah, all over the
world, apparently.

261
00:23:11,214 --> 00:23:13,317
She likes to travel.

262
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,083
Yep.

263
00:23:15,117 --> 00:23:18,021
Or she doesn't wanna
go home.

264
00:23:18,053 --> 00:23:19,254
Hmm.

265
00:23:31,732 --> 00:23:33,733
Did you tell him?

266
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,169
I didn't need to.

267
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,802
Any sign of those kids?

268
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:19,073
Couldn't find them.

269
00:24:20,941 --> 00:24:22,710
But I scared them good.

270
00:24:23,844 --> 00:24:25,146
We're fine.

271
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:30,316
I want them gone,
no matter what it takes.

272
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,718
Are we clear?

273
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:51,836
Can you fix this?

274
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:53,404
I can patch it up.

275
00:24:53,436 --> 00:24:56,072
But I don't know
if it'd hold.

276
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:06,815
Arianne. Hello?

277
00:25:06,847 --> 00:25:09,417
I just wanted to thank you.

278
00:25:11,153 --> 00:25:12,320
For what?

279
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:15,123
Well, for getting us
this far.

280
00:25:15,155 --> 00:25:17,459
Pay me first,
thank me later.

281
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:21,962
You know, I was thinking.

282
00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:24,898
We could use your help
in the mine,

283
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,167
if you care to join.

284
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:29,302
I'm not a scientist.

285
00:25:29,334 --> 00:25:32,270
My responsibility
is to get you there as agreed.

286
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:34,406
Then I'm done.

287
00:25:34,438 --> 00:25:38,177
Okay, but what's next for you
after this?

288
00:25:38,209 --> 00:25:39,409
I've got another gig.

289
00:25:39,443 --> 00:25:40,979
What, more exciting
than being part

290
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:43,782
of a groundbreaking
scientific discovery?

291
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:46,351
I don't discuss
my clients with...

292
00:25:46,383 --> 00:25:49,119
Right, yes,
with other clients, right.

293
00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:54,191
Where did you scoop up

294
00:25:54,224 --> 00:25:57,225
that group
of super hombres out there?

295
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,493
What's that?

296
00:25:58,526 --> 00:26:00,963
That group of men you have.

297
00:26:03,932 --> 00:26:06,101
Terry's an old acquaintance.

298
00:26:06,134 --> 00:26:07,335
He's not much of a talker.

299
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:10,304
But he knows his tech
and can power up

300
00:26:10,338 --> 00:26:13,307
pretty much anything with
a stick and a piece of string.

301
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,041
Shawn is...

302
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:18,978
We share the same fascination
for this place, really.

303
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,581
And as annoying as he is,
he's an expert geologist.

304
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:25,418
He has my respect.

305
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:28,554
Jaime's pretty new.
He joined us about a month ago.

306
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,221
Security services.

307
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,424
Why do you need
private security

308
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:36,060
for a scientific expedition?

309
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:37,995
Well, to keep us safe.

310
00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:39,897
Safe from what?

311
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:42,100
Um...

312
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,202
I like to be prepared.

313
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:50,306
What are you expecting
to find here?

314
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,909
Anthracite.

315
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:55,143
Ultra high-grade.

316
00:26:55,177 --> 00:26:57,313
It burns like nothing else.

317
00:26:57,345 --> 00:26:59,581
If... If we can sample it,

318
00:26:59,613 --> 00:27:03,150
find out exactly
how it smolders and spreads,

319
00:27:03,184 --> 00:27:06,087
we might have a key
to understanding what causes

320
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,624
these environmental disasters
and prevent future ones.

321
00:27:10,657 --> 00:27:14,627
And that's it? Nothing more?

322
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:17,896
A thousand people lived
in Shookum Hills, Arianne.

323
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,500
A thousand, all gone.

324
00:27:22,532 --> 00:27:24,001
Even with a great fire

325
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:25,870
people don't just disappear
like that.

326
00:27:25,904 --> 00:27:28,472
Towns don't.

327
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:31,441
Something else
happened here.

328
00:27:31,474 --> 00:27:33,343
Something more.

329
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:35,879
And I'm here
to discover what that is,

330
00:27:35,913 --> 00:27:37,514
document it

331
00:27:37,547 --> 00:27:38,948
and bring it home.

332
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,050
So the truth, I guess, is...

333
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:43,553
what I'm hoping to find.

334
00:27:46,988 --> 00:27:51,360
I'm sorry.
It's just my vitamins.

335
00:27:56,095 --> 00:27:58,900
So, what... What do you think
we'll find here?

336
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,602
Only what you take with you.

337
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:06,639
Nietzsche, right?

338
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,575
Yoda.

339
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:14,479
Right.

340
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:20,150
Well, have a good night.

341
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:22,954
Good night.

342
00:29:08,526 --> 00:29:12,029
Darren. This is what,
like the fifth one of these?

343
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:15,199
Yeah, it's probably
a warning system for gas leaks.

344
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:17,067
Looks pretty new.

345
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:18,268
Look at this.

346
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,972
Studio foam.

347
00:29:21,005 --> 00:29:23,640
- What?
- Soundproofing.

348
00:29:23,672 --> 00:29:26,142
What is that doing here?

349
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:32,081
Terry.

350
00:29:33,581 --> 00:29:36,151
Yeah, I see it.

351
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,426
I smell sulfur. Be careful.

352
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:48,461
Yeah, I'll take out
the CO2 readers.

353
00:29:51,196 --> 00:29:53,466
Check the BTUs.

354
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,434
Someone's coming. Get down.

355
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:05,977
Guys,
that's the car from yesterday.

356
00:30:09,347 --> 00:30:10,513
Let's keep moving.

357
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:12,283
They know we're here.

358
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,246
- Hey, Terry?
- Yeah.

359
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:52,151
You can literally feel heat
from the fires.

360
00:31:07,396 --> 00:31:09,465
Guys!

361
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:11,568
Come look at this!

362
00:31:37,723 --> 00:31:39,725
We found it.

363
00:32:10,552 --> 00:32:13,655
These buildings are
way older than I expected.

364
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:15,357
It makes sense.

365
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:17,825
This has been a mining town
since the early 1900s.

366
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:21,262
- I'm gonna document this.
- Yeah.

367
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:27,233
This looks
like some kind of shop.

368
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:51,822
Oh, look at this.

369
00:32:54,691 --> 00:32:55,826
What's the air stat?

370
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:01,763
Slightly elevated,
but that's to be expected.

371
00:33:01,796 --> 00:33:03,600
Nothing out of the green.

372
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,502
But as the mines burn,

373
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:12,207
they occasionally release
methane and carbon monoxide.

374
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:15,575
And this air monitor detects
them before we do.

375
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,845
Yeah,
we should probably get out of here.

376
00:33:17,878 --> 00:33:20,714
It's our canary
in the coal mine as it were.

377
00:33:20,746 --> 00:33:22,614
Now, as you can see,

378
00:33:22,648 --> 00:33:26,485
entire shops and houses
were abandoned outright.

379
00:33:28,286 --> 00:33:31,556
We've yet to determine
if the inhabitants left

380
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:37,263
because of the gases,
the sinkholes or something else.

381
00:34:27,537 --> 00:34:29,840
So can I thank you now?

382
00:34:29,874 --> 00:34:31,509
You surely can.

383
00:34:56,431 --> 00:34:57,865
Shoot away, mate.

384
00:34:57,897 --> 00:35:01,535
- I wonder how far down this goes?
- Well, let's find out.

385
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:04,704
Yeah, it's electrified.

386
00:35:04,738 --> 00:35:06,439
Well, can we power it off
or something?

387
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,741
I don't know about powering off,
maybe bypass it.

388
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,777
Like that?

389
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,846
Yeah, something like that.
Get the scanner.

390
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,419
You can't get any closer.

391
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,887
He's fine.

392
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,856
We should secure you both
with a line.

393
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,392
This grate's unstable.
It's not safe.

394
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,760
I can't authorize this.

395
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,694
You're right. You can't.

396
00:35:30,727 --> 00:35:32,029
Go on.

397
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:41,903
- Get the scanner.
- Yep. One second.

398
00:35:41,936 --> 00:35:43,972
Hey, Shawn. Can you give me
a hand with this?

399
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:45,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

400
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,978
Terry.

401
00:35:51,011 --> 00:35:53,013
- Yeah?
- What is that?

402
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:55,082
Records image, sound,
measures air composition,

403
00:35:55,115 --> 00:35:57,751
then distills and separates
each individual component

404
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:58,952
for subsequent analysis.

405
00:35:58,985 --> 00:36:00,620
It checks for anthracite.

406
00:36:00,653 --> 00:36:01,853
Got it.

407
00:36:01,886 --> 00:36:03,488
All right, here we go.

408
00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:05,391
Lower it, Shawn.

409
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,735
Okay, what do you got?

410
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:21,471
Nothing yet.

411
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:22,773
All right.

412
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,309
Lower it.

413
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:37,420
I hit the bottom.

414
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,655
Nothing?

415
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:41,356
No.

416
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:43,490
All right, here we go.

417
00:36:52,164 --> 00:36:53,499
Hey, Shawn.

418
00:36:58,669 --> 00:37:01,806
C15-H11-0.

419
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,641
The composition
is extremely pure.

420
00:37:03,674 --> 00:37:06,510
I've never seen
anything like that.

421
00:37:06,543 --> 00:37:07,845
That's it, man.

422
00:37:07,878 --> 00:37:09,646
We've got it.

423
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,383
I've found it.

424
00:37:12,617 --> 00:37:13,984
Shawn, bring up the scanner.

425
00:37:14,016 --> 00:37:17,154
Hey, hold on, one second.
Wait, wait, wait.

426
00:37:17,187 --> 00:37:18,755
There is something
down there.

427
00:37:23,691 --> 00:37:25,427
What the hell is that?

428
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Aah! Fuck!

429
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,969
- What happened?
- Goddamn it!

430
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,737
- What?
- It blew my ear drum out, man.

431
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,839
Turn it up. Listen to this.

432
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:42,977
Turn it up.

433
00:37:45,578 --> 00:37:46,913
Listen.

434
00:37:49,782 --> 00:37:51,451
Right there.

435
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What is that?
- You hear it?
- Sort of.

436
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,733
Terry!

437
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:10,699
- Terry!
- Terry!

438
00:38:10,732 --> 00:38:12,067
Help!

439
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,769
Help me!

440
00:38:13,803 --> 00:38:17,473
- Can you hear us?
- We have to get him.

441
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:18,706
Terry!

442
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,477
Oh, no! Oh, no!

443
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,078
No! Help me!

444
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,646
Help me!

445
00:38:28,748 --> 00:38:31,553
- What just happened?
- Jaime, get over here.

446
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:33,554
- Jaime!
- We shouldn't have been here.

447
00:38:33,587 --> 00:38:34,754
We shouldn't be here.

448
00:38:34,787 --> 00:38:36,722
Shawn,
I need the gas detector.

449
00:38:36,756 --> 00:38:38,626
Shawn! The detector.

450
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:40,828
Darren!

451
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:43,863
We're going in after him, okay?

452
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:45,564
Just keep close
and follow my lead.

453
00:38:45,598 --> 00:38:47,032
I got it.

454
00:38:57,608 --> 00:38:58,976
Let's go.

455
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:41,746
Terry.

456
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,015
Terry.

457
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,550
Terry!

458
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,620
Terry.

459
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:52,490
Terry!

460
00:39:55,257 --> 00:39:56,826
Terry!

461
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,909
Darren.

462
00:40:15,876 --> 00:40:17,112
Hey!

463
00:40:20,781 --> 00:40:21,916
I'll talk to him.

464
00:40:23,749 --> 00:40:25,984
We need your help.
You need to call for help.

465
00:40:26,018 --> 00:40:28,688
- What have you done?
- Our friends are down there.

466
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:30,023
What have you done?

467
00:40:30,056 --> 00:40:31,590
Someone fell down the hole.

468
00:40:31,623 --> 00:40:33,758
- How long has this been open?
- Our friends...

469
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,227
How long has this been open!

470
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:38,029
Sir. It's fine. It's fine.

471
00:40:38,062 --> 00:40:40,097
Jaime, did you hear that?

472
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:44,168
Jaime.

473
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,637
Gas levels
are through the roof.

474
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,204
We have to get out of here.

475
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,640
I'm not leaving him
down here.

476
00:40:51,674 --> 00:40:55,545
If we don't save ourselves,
everyone dies.

477
00:40:58,947 --> 00:41:00,149
We have to go.

478
00:41:02,217 --> 00:41:04,686
- Someone fell down the hole.
- You've got a rope.

479
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,088
- I'll cut it.
- No. No.

480
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:09,123
- No.
- Back the fuck up.

481
00:41:09,156 --> 00:41:10,625
It's fine, sir.

482
00:41:10,658 --> 00:41:12,025
You can't do that.

483
00:41:12,058 --> 00:41:14,160
There's people down there.

484
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:15,995
Arianne, quick!

485
00:41:16,028 --> 00:41:17,164
Jaime.

486
00:41:24,703 --> 00:41:26,771
What's going on?

487
00:41:26,804 --> 00:41:28,840
- Fuck.
- Let's go.

488
00:41:30,642 --> 00:41:31,777
Oh, fuck.

489
00:41:33,044 --> 00:41:34,812
- Is he dead?
- No, no.

490
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:36,714
- Did I kill him?
- No, he's fine.

491
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:37,949
He's fine, Shawn.

492
00:41:40,983 --> 00:41:42,119
He's fine.

493
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:53,061
What happened? Who is this?

494
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:55,998
He tried to cut the rope.

495
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,798
Hey, hey.

496
00:41:57,831 --> 00:42:00,368
- Call an ambulance.
- How? Our cells are no good here

497
00:42:00,402 --> 00:42:02,268
and our satellite phone
was on Terry.

498
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:04,204
Where is he?

499
00:42:04,237 --> 00:42:06,906
Where's Terry?
What happened to him?

500
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,143
- We couldn't find him.
- Fuck! Fuck this!

501
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:11,378
- We couldn't find him.
- What do you mean?

502
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,845
He didn't run away.

503
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:14,647
No, of course not.

504
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,015
So? What happened to him?

505
00:42:16,048 --> 00:42:17,750
We don't know
what's down there.

506
00:42:17,783 --> 00:42:19,250
Gas levels were sky-high.

507
00:42:20,819 --> 00:42:23,154
We might be dealing
with something...

508
00:42:23,188 --> 00:42:24,757
Something else.

509
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,957
- What was that thing?
- What thing?

510
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,859
- You saw. We all saw.
- I don't know

511
00:42:28,892 --> 00:42:31,829
- what you're talking about.
- What do you mean?

512
00:42:31,861 --> 00:42:33,897
- We need to leave now!
- Just leave him here?

513
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:36,299
The man came with a knife
and a shotgun.

514
00:42:36,331 --> 00:42:38,835
I'm not waiting to see
what he pulls next.

515
00:42:41,903 --> 00:42:43,705
Okay, we'll call for help

516
00:42:43,738 --> 00:42:45,307
as soon as we reach a spot
where we can.

517
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:46,709
Now let's go. Please.

518
00:42:46,742 --> 00:42:49,278
Guys, he's right. Let's go.

519
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,645
Come on, let's go.

520
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:09,095
I should have never allowed you
to convince me to come here.

521
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,297
You've been as obsessed
with this place as I have.

522
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:13,832
- But given your track record.
- Fuck off, Shawn.

523
00:43:13,864 --> 00:43:16,701
Darren's received five warnings
for scientific misconduct

524
00:43:16,734 --> 00:43:19,171
from three universities,
two kicked him out.

525
00:43:19,203 --> 00:43:20,705
- What?
- Who do old thinkers expel

526
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:22,273
- from their midst?
- Psychopaths.

527
00:43:22,305 --> 00:43:24,809
- Visionaries.
- Who is funding this again?

528
00:43:24,842 --> 00:43:26,943
It isn't Cambridge
Earth Science Department.

529
00:43:28,878 --> 00:43:30,013
Oh, shit.

530
00:43:33,315 --> 00:43:34,451
Fuck!

531
00:43:35,484 --> 00:43:37,219
Fuck! Fuck!

532
00:43:37,252 --> 00:43:38,954
Fuck!

533
00:43:41,256 --> 00:43:42,758
Fuck!

534
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:44,158
This thing's not going anywhere.

535
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:45,493
It'll be dark soon.

536
00:43:45,525 --> 00:43:47,194
We better reach the fence.
Let's go.

537
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:36,938
Fuck.

538
00:44:46,346 --> 00:44:48,149
Oh, shit. Fuck.

539
00:44:52,985 --> 00:44:55,488
This is Dale. Come in.

540
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>Gotcha, what's up?</i>
We have a breach.
Repeat. We have a breach.

541
00:45:16,873 --> 00:45:18,175
What the fuck is going on?

542
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:20,476
We triggered an alarm.

543
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,178
Through that, then west.
We should be back on track.

544
00:45:23,211 --> 00:45:25,580
- Okay. There it is again.
- What? What is it?

545
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,917
- Listen.
- What is that?

546
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,085
There.

547
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:40,227
Turn off the flashlights.
Give me the night vision.

548
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:41,895
What is that?

549
00:45:41,928 --> 00:45:43,997
Don't know. Same thing I heard
in the tunnel.

550
00:45:44,029 --> 00:45:45,498
Where is it coming from?

551
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,900
Follow the light on my bag.

552
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:49,520
- Jaime. Stay close.
- What?

553
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I hear something, over there.
Yeah, I hear it too.
Look out!

554
00:46:58,961 --> 00:47:00,563
What the fuck was that?

555
00:47:06,402 --> 00:47:07,603
Shawn!

556
00:47:11,674 --> 00:47:14,575
Go. Go, move. Go!

557
00:47:14,608 --> 00:47:15,976
Shit!

558
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,679
Everybody run.

559
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:19,213
Run!

560
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:21,649
Go, go, go!

561
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,927
Hey! Guys, a truck!
Let's go, now!

562
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:35,227
Hey!

563
00:47:36,294 --> 00:47:37,462
Help us!

564
00:47:37,494 --> 00:47:39,464
Hey, over here!

565
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:43,335
Get in the truck.

566
00:47:43,368 --> 00:47:45,269
Now, quick!

567
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:52,577
Go, go, go!

568
00:49:03,704 --> 00:49:05,505
Out of my way.

569
00:49:05,538 --> 00:49:06,674
Move.

570
00:49:07,741 --> 00:49:09,377
Wait here and keep quiet.

571
00:49:18,383 --> 00:49:20,252
Where's Dale?

572
00:49:20,285 --> 00:49:24,123
- I'm getting nothing.
- Get him on the radio.

573
00:49:24,155 --> 00:49:26,192
Keep trying.

574
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,735
I knew it.

575
00:49:40,503 --> 00:49:43,140
I knew you son of a bitches
were gonna cause trouble.

576
00:49:44,673 --> 00:49:46,741
Who are you?

577
00:49:46,774 --> 00:49:48,377
What are you doing here?

578
00:49:50,145 --> 00:49:52,547
My name is Darren Atkins,

579
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,181
Professor of Geology

580
00:49:54,215 --> 00:49:57,084
at the Department
of Earth Sciences, Cambridge.

581
00:49:57,117 --> 00:49:59,486
We're here
on purely academic purposes

582
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:02,489
to perform a series
of geological survey tests.

583
00:50:04,591 --> 00:50:06,293
How did you find us?

584
00:50:06,326 --> 00:50:10,062
Your guys
basically led us straight here.

585
00:50:10,095 --> 00:50:12,697
We had a general sense
of the area.

586
00:50:12,731 --> 00:50:15,234
You had a general sense
of the area?

587
00:50:15,267 --> 00:50:16,569
Yes.

588
00:50:16,602 --> 00:50:19,070
What does that mean?
A general sense of the area.

589
00:50:23,674 --> 00:50:25,242
What did you just say?

590
00:50:25,274 --> 00:50:26,543
How did you find us?

591
00:50:28,178 --> 00:50:30,548
My father used
to track down people for money,

592
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,182
and I knew I had to look

593
00:50:32,216 --> 00:50:35,552
for where someone
made an effort to hide a trail.

594
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:38,387
Where's your father now?

595
00:50:40,355 --> 00:50:41,656
He lost his way.

596
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,394
Well, we've all lost something,
haven't we?

597
00:50:48,263 --> 00:50:50,632
Schuttmann.
I can't reach Dale or Cain.

598
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:54,769
It could be out of range.

599
00:50:56,836 --> 00:50:58,538
You're Paul Schuttmann?

600
00:50:58,571 --> 00:51:02,342
Co-founder of Shookum Hills
mining company?

601
00:51:03,843 --> 00:51:05,577
I used to be.

602
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:09,748
Now I do what you might call
security and protection work.

603
00:51:11,215 --> 00:51:13,383
What is it you protect?

604
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:14,685
You.

605
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:16,855
What happened here?
What is this place?

606
00:51:16,888 --> 00:51:18,656
A fucking hellhole.
That's what it is.

607
00:51:18,688 --> 00:51:21,791
Everybody here has their
own beliefs about what this is.

608
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:23,527
What's yours?

609
00:51:24,794 --> 00:51:26,464
Maybe it's purgatory.

610
00:51:28,198 --> 00:51:30,299
The place where we go
to confront our sins,

611
00:51:30,331 --> 00:51:32,467
where we're tested
on our flaws.

612
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:37,738
And you either come clean
or get destroyed.

613
00:51:37,772 --> 00:51:39,841
My sin was greed.

614
00:51:39,874 --> 00:51:41,343
What's yours?

615
00:51:42,544 --> 00:51:45,412
<i>Shelby, you there?</i>

616
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:46,881
I'm here.

617
00:51:46,913 --> 00:51:48,882
<i>I got a couple of them,
scattered the rest.</i>

618
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:50,885
<i>There's a lot of them.
We've got a breach somewhere.</i>

619
00:51:50,918 --> 00:51:52,486
<i>I don't know.</i>

620
00:51:52,518 --> 00:51:54,586
Find the breach.
I'll see what I can do here

621
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,788
and get back to you.

622
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,757
You opened a sinkhole?

623
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:59,225
- I suppose we...
- Which one!

624
00:51:59,258 --> 00:52:00,393
I'll show you.

625
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,531
Look,
we lost a man down there.

626
00:52:05,563 --> 00:52:07,632
Another one in the field.

627
00:52:09,567 --> 00:52:11,435
Go with them. Find it.

628
00:52:11,468 --> 00:52:14,337
- Seal it before it's too late.
- Let's go.

629
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,508
Move, asshole.

630
00:52:17,673 --> 00:52:19,342
Professor.

631
00:52:29,618 --> 00:52:31,719
- What are those?
- Keep up.

632
00:52:31,752 --> 00:52:33,420
Why is this area
unprotected?

633
00:52:33,454 --> 00:52:34,689
It's not.

634
00:52:34,722 --> 00:52:36,758
We protect it.
We protect everybody.

635
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:38,959
Before y'all showed up,
we were doing a fine...

636
00:52:41,527 --> 00:52:43,230
Nobody move.

637
00:52:43,263 --> 00:52:44,965
They sounded us.

638
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:46,600
Hide.

639
00:52:52,905 --> 00:52:55,608
Ellroy,
do you see anything out there?

640
00:52:57,442 --> 00:52:59,476
<i>Shelby, you copy?</i>

641
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,744
Keep it down. What's up?

642
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,580
<i>Stay in the safe house.</i>

643
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:06,216
<i>Whatever you do,
don't come out.</i>

644
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:09,753
It's kind of too late
for that, Kip.

645
00:53:09,785 --> 00:53:12,455
<i>We made it to Safe House 4,
barely.</i>

646
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:13,623
<i>They're everywhere.</i>

647
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:16,793
How many?

648
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:19,963
<i>It's hard to say.
Never seen anything like it.</i>

649
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:21,630
Fuck.

650
00:53:21,663 --> 00:53:23,565
<i>You've gotta get back inside,
Shel.</i>

651
00:53:23,598 --> 00:53:26,602
There's a house on the hill.
Do you think we can make it?

652
00:53:26,634 --> 00:53:29,536
We don't know how many are out
there. We need to stay put.

653
00:53:31,271 --> 00:53:33,807
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I can't run fast enough,

654
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,442
but I can slow them down.

655
00:53:35,476 --> 00:53:39,478
- What?
- Find the breach and close it.

656
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:40,779
So give me this.

657
00:53:40,812 --> 00:53:42,215
And the lighter.

658
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:48,954
Tell Dolores I didn't mess up
my good coat. All right?

659
00:53:48,986 --> 00:53:51,756
Now, y'all
get the fuck out of here.

660
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:53,524
Go on, get.

661
00:53:54,991 --> 00:53:58,529
Here I am, come get me!

662
00:53:59,996 --> 00:54:02,465
Hey, you bastards!

663
00:54:03,566 --> 00:54:05,301
Shit.

664
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,743
In there!

665
00:54:30,657 --> 00:54:32,759
This is not good.

666
00:54:49,473 --> 00:54:51,276
This isn't good.

667
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

668
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:15,330
There's one outside.

669
00:55:15,363 --> 00:55:17,799
You have a rifle.

670
00:55:17,832 --> 00:55:20,435
If anything comes in here,
you use it.

671
00:55:20,468 --> 00:55:23,036
They are attracted to noise.

672
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I don't see it anymore.

673
00:55:50,526 --> 00:55:52,861
- <i>Shelby, your status?</i>
- Shit. Shit.

674
00:56:01,703 --> 00:56:03,806
What is it doing?

675
00:56:05,473 --> 00:56:07,375
Calling the others.

676
00:56:08,642 --> 00:56:10,111
Listen carefully now.

677
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:15,615
No matter what you do,
don't let them grab you.

678
00:56:18,116 --> 00:56:20,386
Because if they grab you,
they paralyze you

679
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,456
and they take you
down there.

680
00:56:24,457 --> 00:56:26,959
God only knows what they
do to you when they've got you.

681
00:56:28,626 --> 00:56:29,794
Go.

682
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,071
Okay.

683
00:56:46,709 --> 00:56:47,944
Fuck!

684
00:56:47,977 --> 00:56:49,112
Back up!

685
00:56:57,151 --> 00:56:59,087
- I'm okay!
- There's an exit!

686
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,390
- Let's go!
- Come on! Go!

687
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,658
Keep moving.

688
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:05,458
There's a way through.

689
00:57:09,128 --> 00:57:11,464
Hurry up, they're coming.

690
00:57:58,204 --> 00:58:00,140
- This way.
- Wait.

691
00:58:00,173 --> 00:58:01,574
Take these.

692
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:04,109
I'm gonna create
a diversion.

693
00:58:04,143 --> 00:58:06,813
- I'll join you again later.
- But we need you.

694
00:58:06,846 --> 00:58:08,981
Have a little faith.

695
00:58:09,013 --> 00:58:10,649
What?

696
00:58:13,718 --> 00:58:16,121
Go.

697
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:21,925
Come and get me,
you assholes!

698
00:58:45,812 --> 00:58:47,681
- It's a dead end.
- In here.

699
00:58:47,714 --> 00:58:50,116
- Come on.
- Yeah, right. Go.

700
00:58:52,184 --> 00:58:55,088
Let's put up that grating.
It'll slow them down.

701
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:00,627
We gotta get it from outside.

702
00:59:03,828 --> 00:59:07,164
Go. Go, hurry up.

703
00:59:09,066 --> 00:59:11,870
Oh, shit. The grenade!
Give me the grenade!

704
00:59:22,211 --> 00:59:23,814
- Jaime!
- Get down!

705
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:48,601
Darren.

706
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:53,540
Darren.

707
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:56,627
Wait. Wait.

708
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:00,998
We've lost them.

709
01:01:02,666 --> 01:01:04,701
We've lost them.

710
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:11,707
Get up. We have to keep going.

711
01:01:11,741 --> 01:01:13,709
They're all gone.

712
01:01:13,742 --> 01:01:15,945
We don't know that.

713
01:01:15,978 --> 01:01:18,780
What if
it doesn't kill them?

714
01:01:18,813 --> 01:01:21,081
Just takes them away,

715
01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:23,685
keeps them alive
somewhere down there?

716
01:01:23,717 --> 01:01:25,654
What if...?

717
01:01:26,888 --> 01:01:28,354
Darren.

718
01:01:28,387 --> 01:01:30,090
Darren.

719
01:01:33,727 --> 01:01:35,329
I should have
never brought you.

720
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,998
I'm the one
who brought us here.

721
01:01:40,366 --> 01:01:43,902
You know, Shawn was right.

722
01:01:45,704 --> 01:01:48,240
We weren't financed
by the university.

723
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:52,776
I was backed
by a private mining company

724
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:55,846
who wanted this coal.

725
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,882
They offered me recognition

726
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,685
and a great deal of money.

727
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,953
That's why we're all here.

728
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,256
That's why they're all gone.

729
01:02:10,726 --> 01:02:12,795
It's my fault.

730
01:02:13,862 --> 01:02:16,830
It's my fault.

731
01:02:16,863 --> 01:02:18,832
I guess you were right.

732
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,870
About what we'd find here.

733
01:02:26,139 --> 01:02:27,307
Truth.

734
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:52,061
My last tour with a repeat team
was a climb in the Himalayas.

735
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:55,031
One of them,
experienced climber,

736
01:02:55,065 --> 01:02:57,266
fell off a cliff.

737
01:02:57,298 --> 01:03:00,335
It was just the two of us
that day.

738
01:03:00,369 --> 01:03:06,174
I had him,
but I couldn't get him up.

739
01:03:06,206 --> 01:03:10,011
We waited for hours,
but no one came.

740
01:03:10,043 --> 01:03:12,114
We would have both frozen
to death.

741
01:03:12,146 --> 01:03:15,482
So in the end,

742
01:03:16,816 --> 01:03:19,252
I cut the rope.

743
01:03:19,285 --> 01:03:22,254
That's what you do
in situations like that.

744
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:27,961
But I won't leave you behind.
You have to come with me.

745
01:03:30,562 --> 01:03:32,998
What's the fucking point?

746
01:03:43,974 --> 01:03:45,476
I'm gonna get help.

747
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:48,245
Take this.

748
01:03:49,411 --> 01:03:51,413
You'll be fine.

749
01:03:51,446 --> 01:03:53,782
Stay here.

750
01:03:53,816 --> 01:03:56,419
I will come back for you.

751
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

752
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

753
01:09:46,156 --> 01:09:49,726
You're alive, thank God.

754
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,462
I tried to find you.

755
01:09:53,762 --> 01:09:56,100
The grenade.

756
01:09:56,132 --> 01:09:59,369
Can you grab it?
I can't move.

757
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:45,876
What is that?

758
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:52,581
An alternative species.

759
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:53,750
Shawn.

760
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:56,385
It's real.

761
01:11:04,192 --> 01:11:06,560
They breed and colonize.

762
01:11:07,694 --> 01:11:10,498
Like ants and bees.

763
01:11:11,565 --> 01:11:13,567
If only the world could see.

764
01:11:13,599 --> 01:11:15,835
If only... No.

765
01:11:23,509 --> 01:11:24,710
Shawn.

766
01:11:44,693 --> 01:11:49,331
Our Father, who art in
heaven, hollowed be thy...

767
01:11:55,737 --> 01:11:57,773
Our Father...

768
01:12:00,773 --> 01:12:02,509
The grenade.

769
01:12:08,614 --> 01:12:12,218
Who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

770
01:12:12,252 --> 01:12:14,354
Thy kingdom come...

771
01:14:11,022 --> 01:14:13,558
We gotta get out of here.
Put this on.

772
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:15,793
They're coming.

773
01:14:41,782 --> 01:14:45,552
They're coming.
Climb. Climb.

774
01:14:56,026 --> 01:14:58,364
Hurry! Darren. Hurry!

775
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:15,945
- No! No! Aah!
- Aah! No!

776
01:15:15,979 --> 01:15:18,548
No! No!

777
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:23,718
Here, take my knife.

778
01:15:23,751 --> 01:15:25,420
Kill it.

779
01:15:46,704 --> 01:15:49,708
It's what you do, right?

780
01:15:49,742 --> 01:15:51,476
In situations like this.

781
01:15:52,743 --> 01:15:55,080
Wait. Don't!

782
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,550
Help me. Get me out of here.

783
01:16:36,582 --> 01:16:38,451
Help me. Help me.

784
01:16:38,484 --> 01:16:40,553
I'm sorry. I can't.

785
01:16:40,585 --> 01:16:42,588
Please. They're coming.

786
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:43,989
Please!

787
01:16:48,825 --> 01:16:50,561
I can't.
No man is more important...

788
01:16:50,594 --> 01:16:52,030
Get her out of here.

789
01:16:53,798 --> 01:16:55,499
Come on. I got you.

790
01:16:58,702 --> 01:16:59,837
Hurry.

791
01:17:06,242 --> 01:17:07,777
I got you. Come on.

792
01:17:07,809 --> 01:17:10,045
Take my hand.
I got you. Here we go.

793
01:17:20,152 --> 01:17:21,789
Go!

794
01:17:44,774 --> 01:17:47,678
Hey. Are you all right?

795
01:17:47,711 --> 01:17:49,780
- Here.
- Yeah.

796
01:17:49,813 --> 01:17:51,680
What happened to your group?

797
01:17:51,714 --> 01:17:52,883
I'm the only one left.

798
01:17:52,915 --> 01:17:54,817
Are you sure?

799
01:17:54,851 --> 01:17:56,519
Yeah.

800
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:03,960
Let's get you out of here.

801
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:48,932
They took my son.

802
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:53,936
And I've been fighting them
ever since.

803
01:18:56,938 --> 01:18:59,074
All we've managed to do so far
is contain them.

804
01:18:59,107 --> 01:19:01,009
You can imagine
what would happen

805
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:02,911
if they made it
over that fence.

806
01:19:04,111 --> 01:19:06,981
Like you can contain them.

807
01:19:07,013 --> 01:19:09,717
People need to know
about this.

808
01:19:11,117 --> 01:19:13,852
People
wouldn't even believe this.

809
01:19:13,886 --> 01:19:16,923
People aren't ready
to know about this.

810
01:19:18,057 --> 01:19:19,858
We've tried to protect him.

811
01:19:19,891 --> 01:19:23,095
We've been working really hard
to keep it a secret.

812
01:19:23,127 --> 01:19:26,097
But you have
to tell someone.

813
01:19:27,732 --> 01:19:29,000
You've been searching
for the truth.

814
01:19:29,032 --> 01:19:32,669
What do you do
when you find the truth?

815
01:19:32,702 --> 01:19:35,305
Do you go
and you tell the people?

816
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:40,777
Or do you stay here
and fight this thing with us?

817
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:46,049
- Me?
- You're a survivor.

818
01:19:47,715 --> 01:19:49,718
What do you survive for?

819
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:54,256
You can't possibly...

820
01:19:55,823 --> 01:19:59,827
rationally believe
you can win this?

821
01:19:59,859 --> 01:20:02,128
I believe we can.

822
01:20:09,268 --> 01:20:11,671
I have to go back.

823
01:20:28,451 --> 01:20:30,221
Arianne.

824
01:20:31,453 --> 01:20:33,055
Good luck.

825
01:21:25,835 --> 01:21:28,003
We're gonna need this.

826
01:21:37,344 --> 01:21:38,946
Yeah.
