1
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:48,142
Oh, man!

2
00:02:49,387 --> 00:02:50,649
Did you see that?

3
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,586
Oh, my God.

4
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:57,652
- Yes! Yes!
- Nice, nice, nice.

5
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:59,027
- Aw, sick!
- Worth the wait.

6
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:00,053
Oh, babe. You missed out.

7
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:01,087
Yes!

8
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:03,534
I want to get off.

9
00:03:18,184 --> 00:03:19,515
That was intense, man.

10
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:21,782
To feel how that would be
to just crash and burn like that.

11
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:24,619
Yeah, yeah. Maybe for you,
but our lives are actually goin' somewhere.

12
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:26,784
Oh! OK, well, where we gotta go
is to the roller coaster.

13
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:28,623
'Cause our pass is for 9:15.

14
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:30,060
If we miss that,
we'll stand in line...

15
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:31,290
for, like, a day and a half,
and that's gonna kill me.

16
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,319
- OK!
- All right?

17
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:33,333
So let's go.

18
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:35,858
They're totally gonna dig this, man!

19
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:38,565
OK. Come on, it won't kill us to get
a deep-fried Snickers and a Coke.

20
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:41,039
Before ridin' Devil's Flight?
Yeah, that might kill me.

21
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:44,202
No! What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, man.

22
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:03,993
Oh, I'll take that.

23
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:05,659
No. Come on, gimme.
It's not even mine, Kevin.

24
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,031
It's the yearbook's.
Just... Kevin.

25
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:09,730
- Oh!
- Oh, got it.

26
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,569
- Oh, my God, you're such an idiot.
- Hey. Hey. Gimme the...

27
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:15,703
- Ow!
- Nice.

28
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:18,439
Um, could you, like,
please delete that one of Stacy?

29
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:21,712
These are for the yearbook.

30
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:23,876
And I have to turn them in tomorrow
to make a deadline...

31
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,944
and, like, I doubt it if a shot of
Stacy Kobayashi's camel toe...

32
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:28,148
is gonna make it in there.

33
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:29,281
Whew. I'd buy two.

34
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,990
Number 38, your order's ready.

35
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:34,051
That's us.

36
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:35,563
I am so sorry.

37
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:37,156
Kevin can get so out of control.

38
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,100
Let me just say
he would make me crazy.

39
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:42,535
Ha! I mean, you know
I'm such a control freak...

40
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:45,335
like I couldn't handle that.

41
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:50,273
I'm breaking up with him.

42
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:53,372
Couple of weeks.
After graduation.

43
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:54,746
I've been wanting to for a while.

44
00:04:54,783 --> 00:04:57,377
But don't tell anybody, OK?

45
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:01,518
Now, that shot there?
That'll sell some yearbooks.

46
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:04,048
- I love it.
- I love it.

47
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:08,428
Oh! Oh, all right,
so I'm a total whore.

48
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:09,955
Come on, go, go, go,
go, go, go go!

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,400
Oh, my God, Ashley, you're winning.
You're totally winning.

50
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:14,460
- Am I winning?
- Yeah, come on, hurry!

51
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:16,369
OK, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

52
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:18,973
Am I winning? Look around,
I don't want to look.

53
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,237
You're totally winning.

54
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:21,335
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

55
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:23,744
- Don't look!
- Oh, my God! Come on!

56
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,078
Oh, my God!
I'm winning! I'm winning!

57
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:31,044
- I won!
- I knew you would.

58
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:33,715
Oh, my God! Gimme my prize.

59
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:35,281
- Good job.
- That was so awesome, Ashley.

60
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:36,383
Ashley.

61
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:44,992
How ya doin', my brother?
You havin' a good time, huh?

62
00:05:46,604 --> 00:05:48,629
You like that?

63
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:51,574
Yeah! You like it.
Give it up. Give it up.

64
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:54,773
Sam!

65
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:01,875
Excuse me.

66
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,319
You're not a senior.

67
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:06,755
And what are
you gonna do about it...

68
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:10,023
Miss "Cutest Couple,"
Rah Rah?

69
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:11,791
Mom know you're here?

70
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,527
You are a complete bitch
if you tell her.

71
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:17,501
Proof where you were.

72
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:19,163
Take a shot of this.

73
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,070
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
That's three.

74
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:30,979
# That is three, number three #

75
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,917
# Oh, I'm the man, I'm the man #
Man, I am hot.

76
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:35,112
- Man, gimme some right here, man.
- Right here! Right here!

77
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:37,314
What you doin'?
Get the fuck back.

78
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,655
My God, I am good. Here we go.

79
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:42,058
Boy, I'll tell ya...
Goddamn.

80
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:43,892
Kind sir, step right up!

81
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,898
There ya go. Whaddaya want?

82
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:48,332
Here we go, baby.
3 for 3. It's all mine.

83
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:50,029
Here we go. Here we go.

84
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:51,229
Big prize. Watch out.
Come on.

85
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:58,776
# That's what I'm talkin' 'bout #

86
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:00,540
We gonna get that one.
You want that blue one?

87
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,604
That's the one we gonna get.

88
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:19,499
You can run, but you cannot hide.

89
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,501
- Yes!
- Whoo! Here we are, baby.

90
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:22,559
Yes!

91
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:24,628
- There it is.
- Awesome.

92
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,536
Here, get a pic of this.

93
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:29,337
This is the beginning of the end.

94
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:34,641
Hey, guys, get in line.

95
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:41,482
Let's go on again!

96
00:07:41,523 --> 00:07:42,547
What's wrong?

97
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,024
I'm...

98
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:48,222
I was having that feeling
like deja vu, you know?

99
00:07:48,263 --> 00:07:51,562
Except for something
that hasn't happened yet.

100
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,657
Hey, J.

101
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,928
Come on, man, let's go.

102
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:55,959
- Yeah, yeah, hold on.
- Come on.

103
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:57,471
What, are you weirded out
by the ride?

104
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:02,334
'Cause, look, I know you.
And I think that maybe...

105
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:03,935
you're nervous about
this roller coaster...

106
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:06,606
because they say the real fear
with these rides...

107
00:08:06,648 --> 00:08:09,947
comes from the feeling
of having no control.

108
00:08:09,984 --> 00:08:13,113
Everyone imagines weird stuff
when they get scared.

109
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:15,817
But it never turns out
to be what they imagine.

110
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:17,348
Never.

111
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:19,787
OK.

112
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:23,560
You can run, but you cannot hide.

113
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,295
Oh! Where you guys are right now
if you raise your hands and just...

114
00:08:26,335 --> 00:08:28,303
Ha... cup them slightly...

115
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:30,737
it'll look you're holding
the devil's balls.

116
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,604
And we'd wanna do that why?

117
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:34,973
When else you ever gonna see
a dick that big?

118
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,272
I'm lookin' at one right now.

119
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:40,840
Man, you guys are smokin' hot.

120
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:43,148
- Get out, Frankie.
- Yeah, why are you even here?

121
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:44,983
Yeah, you graduated,
like, two years ago.

122
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:47,387
I stuck around to monitor
your development.

123
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,289
Yeah. Good to go.
Good to go, baby.

124
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:51,317
Let's do it. Let's do it.
Come on. Come on.

125
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:55,559
You may never return
from Devil's Flight.

126
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,960
You're totally sad.

127
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:04,640
Try not to scream!

128
00:09:11,148 --> 00:09:13,048
That was totally awesome!

129
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,415
Yeah! Sweet!

130
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:40,341
You all right?

131
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:42,676
There's nothing to worry about.

132
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:44,909
A roller coaster
is just elemental physics.

133
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,976
A conversion of potential energy
to kinetic energy.

134
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,147
Yeah. Odds are like
one in 250 million...

135
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,520
of dying in a roller coaster.

136
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,889
Yeah, yeah,
thanks for that, McKinley.

137
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,224
You're more likely to die
driving to an amusement park...

138
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:58,252
than dying at one.

139
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,006
Here we go.

140
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,375
You like this?

141
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,012
Won it on the Wacky Ladder.

142
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:24,649
You know that ladder deal
that wobbles? Took it.

143
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,421
I like this. It's old school.

144
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,486
Frankie Cheeks
is old school, ladies.

145
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,330
What's that?
Oh, well, it'd be my honor.

146
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,301
Oh! Let's go.

147
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,964
Hey... Baby.

148
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,939
- How many?
- Uh, 4.

149
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,305
- 4.
- Yeah.

150
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,673
Uh, gate one.

151
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,972
- Yeah. Front car.
- Yes!

152
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,137
Wait... No. No, please.

153
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,580
I'm sorry, I don't wanna be a hassle.
I just... I can't sit in the front.

154
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:50,777
I cannot see the tracks. I'll freak.

155
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:53,343
OK. Take it easy.

156
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:56,447
Uh, well, Carrie will sit in
the back with you. Right, babe?

157
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,482
Uh! Why me?
What? 'Cause we're girls?

158
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:02,552
Fuck that. I'm going to Berkeley
and I won't get to do this for a while.

159
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:03,790
I'm sitting in the front.

160
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,288
J, just go, OK? I'll live.

161
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:06,628
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

162
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:07,759
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

163
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,768
All right, you know what?
We'll just settle this like real men.

164
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,463
How about that? Hmm? Call it.

165
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,534
Heads.

166
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:16,132
Shit! Damn it.

167
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:19,577
All right, fine, what the fuck.
It's the same ride, right?

168
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,409
Go. Go ahead. Bye, babe.

169
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,972
Hey, uh, just do me a favor.

170
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,814
Keep an eye on her, OK?
She's kinda freaked out.

171
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:26,978
- Oh. Cool.
- All right?

172
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,954
Yeah. Boom, buddy.
No problem.

173
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,047
Here we go. Hey!

174
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,253
J! Keep your hands
to yourself, man.

175
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,592
I'm serious. You know,
payback's a bitch, OK?

176
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,427
You know, she might need
some comforting...

177
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,057
and I'll be there for her. OK?

178
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,364
Hey, no! No.
Get out. Get out.

179
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,801
Hey! Find another cockpit,
Top Gun.

180
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,532
No. Get...

181
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,598
Let's just get in the back, OK?

182
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:29,981
Guess who's back?

183
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:36,023
I'll meet you at the end.

184
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:39,393
Here! All right!

185
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:40,587
Cool!

186
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:44,094
Hey. How'd you guys
get in here?

187
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:45,861
What? I'm 55 inches.

188
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,367
- Sure. Come on out.
- Oh, man.

189
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:48,699
You, too. Out.

190
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:49,931
Ready?

191
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:52,372
I told you
we wouldn't get away with it.

192
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:53,432
You OK?

193
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:55,000
Let's go on the bumper cars.

194
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:56,978
Come on. Here we go.

195
00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:01,611
Yeah!

196
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:07,513
What's up, man? I'm good.

197
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:13,855
Dare you to, uh, flash me
them sweet, sweet titties...

198
00:13:13,896 --> 00:13:15,124
when we go through the loop.

199
00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:22,428
All right.

200
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,906
Yo! What, you can't read?

201
00:13:32,682 --> 00:13:35,150
Oh. Well, can I just put it
in my pocket, man?

202
00:13:35,185 --> 00:13:36,209
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

203
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:38,244
Yeah? Cool.
Thanks, buddy. Sorry.

204
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:50,329
Aw, shit!

205
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:54,897
Here you go!

206
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:09,143
Whoo! Win, baby!
Yes, baby! Win!

207
00:14:09,187 --> 00:14:10,984
Come on!

208
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:12,819
Come on. Get hyped.

209
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:14,154
The first hill's so high.

210
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,625
Yeah.

211
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,527
This is what we need!

212
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:21,396
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

213
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:27,297
- Let's do this!
- Just win!

214
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:35,239
Aw, yeah!

215
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:07,740
Whoo! Shit!

216
00:15:17,056 --> 00:15:18,853
Oh, man.

217
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:20,825
Oh, my God!

218
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,849
Here we go!

219
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:23,589
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

220
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:20,249
Yeah! Show me your titties!

221
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:21,414
Fuck off, Frankie!

222
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:46,280
Oh, shit!

223
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:53,753
Oh, my God!
We're gonna fall off!

224
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:00,028
No!

225
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:38,534
- Yow!
- Kevin!

226
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:40,697
No!

227
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,483
No!

228
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,931
Erin, hang on!

229
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:13,335
Erin!

230
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:14,861
- Hang on!
- Don't let go!

231
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:15,873
I can't.

232
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,201
No!

233
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:25,178
Oh, God!

234
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:26,775
Hang on, Wen.

235
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:29,719
Hang on! Help me rock it!

236
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:43,624
Almost got it! Gently.

237
00:18:58,518 --> 00:18:59,951
No!

238
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:09,957
Yo. What, you can't read?

239
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:11,658
Oh, well. I'll just...
I'll put it in my pocket, OK?

240
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:12,791
Yeah.

241
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,357
Thanks, bro.

242
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:15,733
Ahh. All right.
Let's do this, Wen...

243
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,635
What're you...?

244
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:19,264
Here you go!

245
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:21,536
Yeah! Let's do it, baby!

246
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:23,600
We have to get off of here.

247
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:26,112
No, don't push the button!
Don't! Don't push the button!

248
00:19:26,347 --> 00:19:28,809
Let me off! Let me off!

249
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:30,180
Wen, Wen! It's all right.
Jesus, it's gonna be over...

250
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:31,946
No! It's gonna crash!
It's gonna crash!

251
00:19:31,986 --> 00:19:32,975
Wendy?

252
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,616
The hydraulics will rupture!
The tracks'll collapse! Please!

253
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:38,125
- What's going on?
- Let me off!

254
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,457
Chick's on somethin'.

255
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:40,552
It's all right! You'll be OK!

256
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:41,619
OK, let 'em out. Just the back.

257
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:42,925
Wen. Hey! Wendy!

258
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,396
Relax. Now, what's the matter?

259
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,837
I saw it. I saw it in my head.

260
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:53,238
The tracks collapsed.
The roller coaster crashed.

261
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,038
No, she was just a little upset before.

262
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:57,102
Man, please, can you please
control that bitch?

263
00:19:57,145 --> 00:20:00,478
Damn. "It's gonna crash!
The hydraulics, the coaster!"

264
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:02,506
Man, she's just trying to get
some fuckin' attention.

265
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:04,281
You know what?
You're a real piece of shit, Lewis.

266
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,787
- Fuck you.
- Fuck moi?

267
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:07,187
No, man, fuck you!
Don't touch me.

268
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:11,460
Just relax!

269
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:12,791
Fight, man!

270
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:13,887
Hey. Hey. Let me out.

271
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,522
Nobody else gets off this ride!

272
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:17,499
Dude, let me off.

273
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:18,830
So high school.

274
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:19,994
Let's out.

275
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:21,060
- Calm down!
- Get off of him!

276
00:20:21,104 --> 00:20:22,128
- Relax!
- Lan!

277
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:25,004
Where you ladies going?
There's a fight.

278
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,636
Get him out of here!
Hey! Calm down! Relax!

279
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:30,976
Dude, let me off.
I gotta make sure she's OK.

280
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:33,243
- Relax! Calm down!
- # Hey! Ho! Let's go #

281
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:34,909
- Get your big ass off me, man!
- # Hey, ho, let's go! #

282
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:37,352
- Let me out!
- # Hey, ho, let's go! #

283
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:38,649
Dude!

284
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:41,556
# Hey, ho, let's go,
hey, ho, let's go #

285
00:20:41,592 --> 00:20:43,321
- Here we go!
- Let me off!

286
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,725
# Hey, ho #

287
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:48,796
Dude, that's my girlfriend!

288
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:49,821
Oh, my God!

289
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:53,269
Stop it! No! Stop it!

290
00:20:54,404 --> 00:20:57,271
Stop it! Please!
Please, the tracks are broken.

291
00:20:57,307 --> 00:21:00,276
Stop! Stop! Please!

292
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,834
Jason!

293
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:03,813
Hey, just relax, OK?

294
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,180
- Please!
- Ease up, man. She's all right.

295
00:21:06,217 --> 00:21:07,343
OK? Just let her settle down.

296
00:21:07,385 --> 00:21:08,852
She can settle down at home!
Now listen...

297
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:10,479
what is your home phone number?

298
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:13,491
OK, we're gonna call your mother.
Everything will be taken care of...

299
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:21,731
Oh, my God! Jason!

300
00:22:56,196 --> 00:22:57,925
Hey, Wendy!

301
00:22:57,964 --> 00:22:59,693
Hey!

302
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:02,429
Wait! Wendy!

303
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:04,061
Hey! Hey, Wen. Wait.

304
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:05,799
I need... I need to talk to you
about something.

305
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,636
Just here to pick up my diploma.

306
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:08,936
You're not going to graduation?

307
00:23:08,975 --> 00:23:10,273
No.

308
00:23:10,311 --> 00:23:14,042
Look, you're not the only one
in a fucked up place, OK?

309
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:16,743
God, I mean,
I just thought maybe...

310
00:23:16,784 --> 00:23:18,809
it'd be good for you to be somewhere
where other people feel the same way.

311
00:23:18,853 --> 00:23:19,842
At graduation?

312
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:21,616
No. Thanks.
I've had enough funerals.

313
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:23,054
Then do it for J and Carrie.

314
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,921
Do what? If you die,
then there's nothing...

315
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,291
then you're just dead,
and they don't know.

316
00:23:27,328 --> 00:23:28,590
And if they are up in Heaven
with Lincoln and Gandhi...

317
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:31,097
do you think they really care about
our high school graduation? No.

318
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:33,600
I am alive, and I don't care.

319
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:34,931
As soon as I pull out
of that parking lot...

320
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:37,267
I am so out of McKinley.

321
00:23:37,304 --> 00:23:38,669
Without J, what's here for me?

322
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:40,697
I'm here. OK?

323
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:44,178
I made a promise to J
that I would take care of you.

324
00:23:44,212 --> 00:23:47,045
On the ride. For 3 minutes.

325
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:49,107
You weren't making
the promise for a lifetime.

326
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:51,176
Kevin...

327
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:52,846
if it wasn't for
you and J being friends...

328
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:54,583
and me and Carrie being friends...

329
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:57,285
we wouldn't have even hung out.

330
00:23:59,461 --> 00:24:02,157
We don't even like each other.

331
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,240
"Lan McKinley."

332
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:15,710
How pathetic is it
that my last name...

333
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,440
is the same as my high school?

334
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,313
Julie, look who
I got to sign my yearbook.

335
00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:23,045
- No way. Nice.
- Yeah.

336
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:32,961
I think we should invite her.

337
00:24:32,995 --> 00:24:34,485
- You think?
- Yeah.

338
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:40,466
Wen? Um...

339
00:24:40,503 --> 00:24:43,064
So we're ready
for graduation tonight...

340
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,507
we're going to
the tanning salon after this...

341
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:47,976
and we are so totally cool
if you wanna come with.

342
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:49,137
Totally.

343
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:51,238
And just like, talk if you want.

344
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,815
Here's my cell.

345
00:24:54,852 --> 00:24:57,116
I already have your number.

346
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:01,382
That was so nice of us.

347
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:12,735
You're not alone.

348
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:14,601
God, I appreciate
everyone trying to help.

349
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:15,867
OK? I really do.

350
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:17,636
No, it's happened before.

351
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:20,701
OK? I went online looking for
an explanation about...

352
00:25:20,745 --> 00:25:23,009
Wendy, just... just listen
to me, all right?

353
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:26,073
All right, look, I went online
looking for an explanation...

354
00:25:26,117 --> 00:25:27,550
about what happened,
and I found out...

355
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:30,110
about this high school
French class from New York.

356
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:33,147
Six years ago
they went on a trip to Paris.

357
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:34,488
When they were boarding...

358
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:36,960
a kid had a vision that
the plane was gonna explode.

359
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:40,055
Just like you did.

360
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:41,656
He freaked out...

361
00:25:41,699 --> 00:25:44,099
and seven people
got off the plane.

362
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:48,004
Just like us.

363
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:53,739
And on takeoff,
Flight 180 blew up.

364
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:56,111
And over the next several months...

365
00:25:56,148 --> 00:26:00,312
everyone who got off that plane
started dying in weird accidents.

366
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:03,810
They died in the order they would've
if they had stayed on the plane.

367
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:07,257
Unless someone intervened,
then it skipped them.

368
00:26:07,293 --> 00:26:09,853
Fuck you, Kevin.

369
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:12,796
W-Wendy! Wendy! Hey!

370
00:26:36,756 --> 00:26:39,623
Ohh, every time we come here.

371
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:42,890
I was thinking of going
for 20 minutes in the Muller.

372
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:45,659
We did that for all the funerals
and it turned out amazing.

373
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:47,133
Yeah, but that was just
a couple of weeks ago, though.

374
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,726
I mean, we're still pretty bronzed.

375
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:50,634
I was just thinking
we could go for, like, a tune-up.

376
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:53,071
I just wanna make sure
that we look our best.

377
00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:54,369
Yeah.

378
00:26:54,408 --> 00:26:56,433
You know, for all those kids
that died that night...

379
00:26:56,477 --> 00:26:58,411
who will never get a graduation.

380
00:27:00,214 --> 00:27:01,704
You know what?
You're totally right.

381
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:04,047
I'm sorry.

382
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:29,969
This is my... my good guy
luck bracelet...

383
00:27:30,012 --> 00:27:32,242
that Grandma left me in her will.

384
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:36,675
Julie?

385
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,385
I need...

386
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,456
I could use some help.

387
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:51,193
I have such...
such guilt over Jason.

388
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:54,260
I should never have let
that ride go.

389
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:57,796
God. I'm usually such
a control freak...

390
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,307
but I didn't do
enough to stop it.

391
00:27:59,342 --> 00:28:02,834
I should've done everything
I could to stop it.

392
00:28:03,846 --> 00:28:06,644
And I would give anything...

393
00:28:06,683 --> 00:28:08,810
to have a second chance.

394
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:13,282
But I never can.

395
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:20,692
I don't want to some day
feel that way about you, Julie.

396
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:24,030
I mean,
I can't talk to Mom and Dad.

397
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,970
You're all I have left.

398
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:31,473
You think when I find a place...

399
00:28:31,508 --> 00:28:33,738
maybe you could come stay
with me for a while?

400
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:38,040
You know I will.

401
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:41,745
You...

402
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:45,277
keep this now...

403
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:47,813
and I'll get it
when I come see you.

404
00:28:49,493 --> 00:28:52,827
Oh. And... hey,
how 'bout on your end?

405
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,027
Can I use the school camera
for graduation tonight?

406
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,900
Yeah. As long as you bring it back
to school on Monday.

407
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,427
Done.

408
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,073
Actually, the battery is pretty low...

409
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,408
so why don't you go get ready,
and I'll recharge it a bit.

410
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,003
Cool.

411
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:25,388
In a hurry, Yuri.

412
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,422
Sorry, sorry.
Cell phone signal is shit in here.

413
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,434
I think tanning beds
mess with signal.

414
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:30,935
I must go outside.

415
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,734
Why don't you just use that phone?

416
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,742
I would, but she talks forever,
then my boss gives me shit.

417
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:39,910
Shit. That's her.

418
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,006
You know what? Just go outside.

419
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,379
We can deal with this ourselves.

420
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:45,941
OK.

421
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:51,949
Hey. No drinks in the room
this time, OK?

422
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,016
Good.

423
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:06,231
What are you doing?

424
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:08,764
Nobody is walking in here
and seein' me naked.

425
00:31:46,276 --> 00:31:48,301
Oh, my God.

426
00:31:58,522 --> 00:32:00,922
Dude, he said no drinks.
If you spill that shit...

427
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:02,755
we're gonna have to clean it
up like last time.

428
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:07,487
Happy, beyotch?
Nothing to spill.

429
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:11,696
Why does Yuri keep it
so cold in here?

430
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:14,593
Maybe it's supposed to be colder
for the machines or whatever.

431
00:32:14,637 --> 00:32:16,696
Oh, a few degrees won't hurt.

432
00:32:42,032 --> 00:32:44,023
Shit! I forgot my iPod.

433
00:32:44,068 --> 00:32:46,059
Sucks, bitch.

434
00:32:46,103 --> 00:32:48,264
They got CDs.

435
00:32:51,675 --> 00:32:53,700
Ew. Celine?

436
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:55,143
Britney?

437
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:57,374
Dude, are we like the only cool people
that come here or what?

438
00:32:57,414 --> 00:33:00,316
Uh, yeah.

439
00:33:00,352 --> 00:33:03,082
Ugh. Whatever.

440
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:20,432
Why are you wearing underwear?

441
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:22,702
Steinmetz says
he gets off on tan lines.

442
00:33:22,741 --> 00:33:25,232
All right.

443
00:34:09,156 --> 00:34:10,680
# Roller coaster #

444
00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:12,021
# Of love #

445
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:13,390
# Say what? #

446
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:15,554
# Roller coaster #

447
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:18,792
# Roller coaster #

448
00:34:18,832 --> 00:34:19,821
# Right #

449
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,459
# Of love #

450
00:34:21,702 --> 00:34:24,034
# Roller coaster #

451
00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:30,006
# Roller coaster of love #

452
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:31,739
# Roller coaster #

453
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:37,918
# Roller coaster of love... #

454
00:34:59,173 --> 00:35:01,141
# I #

455
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:08,813
# I'm gonna ride, girl #

456
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:28,493
# Roller coaster of love #

457
00:35:28,537 --> 00:35:29,765
# Love roller coaster, girl #

458
00:35:29,805 --> 00:35:31,568
# Roller coaster #

459
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:34,475
# Lovin' you
in a freaky world, child #

460
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:37,480
# Roller coaster of love #

461
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:47,154
Camera charged?

462
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,091
Oh, um, sorry,
the battery's totally dead.

463
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:51,957
Camera's not working. Sorry.

464
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:58,428
Look, Julie, I need a minute, OK?

465
00:35:58,468 --> 00:36:00,459
Like private.

466
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:07,977
# That feels nice,
roller coaster #

467
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:10,276
# One more time #

468
00:36:10,314 --> 00:36:13,750
# Roller coaster of love #

469
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:16,582
# Roller coaster #

470
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:22,183
# Roller coaster of love #

471
00:36:26,897 --> 00:36:29,365
It's way too warm in here now, huh?

472
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:37,575
I fucked up.
I set it too hot in here.

473
00:36:56,795 --> 00:36:57,921
Hello?

474
00:36:57,963 --> 00:37:00,955
- Hey, Ashley, it's Wendy...
- Psych! Leave a message.

475
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:03,698
Hi, Ashley, this is Wendy.

476
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:04,759
Gimme a call whenever
you guys are done.

477
00:37:05,804 --> 00:37:07,670
And thanks again for the invite.

478
00:37:07,707 --> 00:37:09,766
Someone help!

479
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Sorry I was too late.

480
00:37:44,611 --> 00:37:45,737
Hey, open the door!

481
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:56,719
Help me!

482
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:17,210
We may feel that our lives
are not our own.

483
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:21,238
That Death controls,
frames our lives.

484
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:24,649
Our birth's nothing
but death begun.

485
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:29,282
Yet, whether it is with
this tragic loss of young lives...

486
00:38:29,324 --> 00:38:32,725
which we have
suffered much of late...

487
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,663
or with the soft passing
of the elderly in the night...

488
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:42,330
we are all equal in Death's eyes.

489
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:45,067
"Equal in Death's eyes?"

490
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:47,065
All of us?
How can you say that?

491
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:48,337
Shut up, McKinley.

492
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:51,039
Dude, think it through.
Charlie Manson made it to 70.

493
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,105
- Osama? Still kickin'.
- Let's go.

494
00:38:53,148 --> 00:38:55,844
Pimps, vice-presidents
walking around.

495
00:38:55,884 --> 00:38:58,580
- All the atrocities they've committed...
- Let's just go. Come on.

496
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,882
They're alive and well.

497
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:03,983
These two girls, who'd never
done shit to anybody...

498
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:06,221
- Shh!
- They don't get to make it to 18?

499
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,888
Where's the fucking
equality in that?

500
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:10,199
- What?
- Come on, man.

501
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:11,894
I can... Yeah. Fine.

502
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,562
Fine. All right. All right.

503
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:15,366
I'm fine. All right.

504
00:39:15,405 --> 00:39:17,168
That's crazy.

505
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:21,940
Those of you who would like
to pay a final remembrance...

506
00:39:21,978 --> 00:39:25,141
please step forward at this time.

507
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:34,848
I so feel this is so my fault.

508
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:37,359
How could it possibly be your fault?

509
00:39:37,393 --> 00:39:40,487
Seein' women as nothin' but fun bags.

510
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:44,524
I mean... if I'd've seen their...

511
00:39:44,568 --> 00:39:47,366
whatever... humanity...

512
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:50,464
they wouldn't have felt
the pressure to look so good.

513
00:39:50,508 --> 00:39:54,911
Impress Franklin Cheeks.
Go on diets. Deodorize.

514
00:39:54,945 --> 00:39:58,312
Stretch. Tan.

515
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,942
Don't be down, Frankie.

516
00:40:00,985 --> 00:40:02,748
Be proud of your ability
to make everything...

517
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:05,050
that happens somehow
a story about you.

518
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,191
God!

519
00:40:21,406 --> 00:40:24,000
Yo, man.
These things really suck, man.

520
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:26,272
Fucking boring.

521
00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:29,144
Hey, if you ever have
to come to my funeral...

522
00:40:29,181 --> 00:40:30,910
man, bring me a PSP or somethin'.

523
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:32,610
'Least I have somethin' to do then.

524
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:39,423
Whew.

525
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,153
Hello?

526
00:40:42,194 --> 00:40:43,753
I'm with J.

527
00:41:10,189 --> 00:41:13,056
What are you doing up here
in the nosebleeds?

528
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:16,495
You know, I could've
gotten you second row.

529
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:19,761
I didn't want to upset
anyone by being there.

530
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,964
And I wondered if
maybe here I could feel J's...

531
00:41:25,472 --> 00:41:27,940
spirit or presence or...

532
00:41:27,975 --> 00:41:29,966
whatever.

533
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,808
But now that I'm here...

534
00:41:32,846 --> 00:41:36,441
if there's any place that makes me feel
like there's no life after death...

535
00:41:38,118 --> 00:41:40,086
it's a cemetery.

536
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:44,959
Yeah, I haven't felt
Carrie's spirit either.

537
00:41:45,994 --> 00:41:47,723
And I've tried.

538
00:41:48,763 --> 00:41:50,697
Real hard.

539
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:56,494
I thought maybe
he's been with me since...

540
00:41:58,506 --> 00:42:02,636
that night...
before I got on the ride...

541
00:42:02,677 --> 00:42:04,577
Jason said...

542
00:42:04,612 --> 00:42:06,204
God, and it was just
to get me on the ride...

543
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:08,044
he said...

544
00:42:08,082 --> 00:42:12,644
"Your fear is from a sense
of having no control."

545
00:42:12,687 --> 00:42:15,383
And I've felt that fear
since the moment he said it.

546
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:19,360
Even thought it maybe somehow
caused the hallucination...

547
00:42:19,395 --> 00:42:23,991
but this fear is more
than just being scared.

548
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:26,593
It's like a presence.

549
00:42:26,635 --> 00:42:30,537
Like a living thing
always with me.

550
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,698
You think it's J?

551
00:42:33,742 --> 00:42:35,266
No, I know it's not.

552
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:40,180
This presence is the opposite
of how J made me feel.

553
00:42:40,215 --> 00:42:44,515
It's cold and terrifying.

554
00:43:20,257 --> 00:43:22,817
That's the last photograph
Lincoln posed for.

555
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,350
The photographic plate
was broken...

556
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:26,761
causing a line
that can't be removed.

557
00:43:26,797 --> 00:43:28,628
Exactly where he was shot.

558
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:32,666
Look. See the shadow?

559
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,899
But what do these pictures
have to do with us?

560
00:43:36,941 --> 00:43:40,308
Look. This occurred
one year to the day...

561
00:43:40,344 --> 00:43:42,403
of the Flight 180 disaster.
Look at the road sign.

562
00:43:42,446 --> 00:43:44,471
Look, I guess you came
to me with this...

563
00:43:44,515 --> 00:43:46,813
because I'm responsible
for putting this in your head...

564
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:48,079
with the Flight 180 thing.

565
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,145
And it did happen,
and it may be occurring here...

566
00:43:50,188 --> 00:43:51,951
but you can't believe
every weird thing out there...

567
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,116
because you're desperate
for an answer.

568
00:43:53,158 --> 00:43:55,058
I took these.

569
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:57,061
That night.

570
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:05,800
These?

571
00:44:09,508 --> 00:44:10,634
Are these it?

572
00:44:15,647 --> 00:44:18,172
Oh, shit.

573
00:44:19,752 --> 00:44:21,652
Oh... shit.

574
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,886
You all right?

575
00:44:28,928 --> 00:44:30,555
I'm feeling a little woozy.

576
00:44:32,231 --> 00:44:34,165
When was the last time you ate?

577
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:36,993
I don't remember.

578
00:44:38,171 --> 00:44:39,866
All right, come on. I'll drive.

579
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:48,340
OK, those kids on Flight 180
died in accidents...

580
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,713
in the order they would've died
if they'd have stayed on the plane.

581
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,378
OK?
So if this is that, then...

582
00:44:54,588 --> 00:44:56,715
then Frankie was behind
Ashlyn and Ashley.

583
00:44:57,991 --> 00:44:59,288
When I saw Ashley
and Ashlyn's picture...

584
00:44:59,326 --> 00:45:01,351
I felt this instinct.

585
00:45:01,394 --> 00:45:03,123
Like there was a hint
in the picture. I even...

586
00:45:03,163 --> 00:45:05,631
I even called to see if
I could keep them from going.

587
00:45:05,665 --> 00:45:06,893
Well, what's
Frankie's picture look like?

588
00:45:06,933 --> 00:45:07,957
It's right here.

589
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:10,333
- You got it?
- Yeah.

590
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,830
Wait! Watch out!

591
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:16,934
Hey! Hey! Are you crazy?

592
00:45:16,977 --> 00:45:19,002
Sorry!

593
00:45:21,482 --> 00:45:23,313
All right,
let's just eat over there.

594
00:45:23,351 --> 00:45:24,579
And go through
the drive through.

595
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:25,813
I don't want anyone hearing
what we're talking about.

596
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:27,548
Well, it's nice to see
that things haven't made you...

597
00:45:27,588 --> 00:45:28,953
any less of a control freak.

598
00:45:37,431 --> 00:45:39,058
- You got it?
- Yeah, all right.

599
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,124
Here's Frank's picture.

600
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:41,691
All right.

601
00:45:41,736 --> 00:45:44,102
Well, this is obvious.
He's falling off a ladder.

602
00:45:44,138 --> 00:45:47,039
A rope ladder, though.
Maybe he might hang.

603
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:50,738
Look, or maybe it's not that literal.
All right, what's...

604
00:45:50,778 --> 00:45:52,006
Could there be anything
in these prizes?

605
00:45:52,046 --> 00:45:54,743
Oh, what, like he's gonna get
crushed by a giant Spongebob?

606
00:45:55,817 --> 00:45:58,115
Hey, Spongebob lives underwater.

607
00:45:59,554 --> 00:46:02,079
It's so sad that you know that.

608
00:46:02,124 --> 00:46:04,149
All right. He won that tacky
mud-flap girl chain...

609
00:46:04,192 --> 00:46:05,750
on this game, though, so...

610
00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:07,762
aren't those usually
on those big 18 wheelers?

611
00:46:07,796 --> 00:46:09,058
Yeah. Yeah.

612
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:10,962
God, I don't see it in
this picture anywhere though.

613
00:46:13,035 --> 00:46:15,230
All right! God.

614
00:46:18,373 --> 00:46:19,704
All right.

615
00:46:23,446 --> 00:46:24,606
Uh, can I take your order?

616
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:26,478
Yeah. What do you want?

617
00:46:31,554 --> 00:46:32,987
Are you OK?

618
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,758
Please tell me
there's a short in your wiring.

619
00:46:46,202 --> 00:46:49,137
Whoa. Whoa. That guy's
way too close to my truck.

620
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:51,265
Hey, you're too fucking
close, man! Pull up!

621
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:52,899
Hey!

622
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:58,742
# There is someone #

623
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,272
Stop! Stop!

624
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,306
# Walking behind you #

625
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,980
Watch out! Shit!

626
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,147
- What the fuck?
- # Turn around #

627
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,282
- Oh, my God!
- # Look at me #

628
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,383
- Get out! Get out!
- What? What?

629
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:11,087
Behind us!

630
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,253
There's no one in that truck!

631
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:12,520
# Watching your footsteps #

632
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,527
# Watching your footsteps #

633
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,624
Shit! Hey! Pull up, man!
Come on! Pull up!

634
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:21,296
- # Look at me #
- Shit!

635
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,305
- # There is someone #
- Back up!

636
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,363
Back up!

637
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:26,399
# Who really loves you #

638
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:30,107
# Here's my heart #

639
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,307
Watch your eyes!
Watch your eyes! Come here!

640
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,544
# In my hand #

641
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:37,315
# Turn around #

642
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,686
- # Look at me #
- Come on. Let's go!

643
00:47:38,723 --> 00:47:40,020
Come on, come on, come on.

644
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

645
00:48:34,347 --> 00:48:37,714
We're all done here.
You need a ride?

646
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,218
Um, we can walk to my house...

647
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:42,619
and then I'll give you
a ride to yours.

648
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,252
No, thanks. We'll be OK.

649
00:48:50,263 --> 00:48:51,321
Will we?

650
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:55,199
Yeah. We'll be all right.

651
00:48:55,234 --> 00:48:57,759
I mean...

652
00:48:57,804 --> 00:48:59,898
how Frank...

653
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,737
God, it... it's not only horrible...

654
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:05,006
but can you feel...
can you feel how vicious it was?

655
00:49:05,045 --> 00:49:06,410
Easy.

656
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:08,381
OK? Easy.

657
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,675
Let's just...

658
00:49:11,718 --> 00:49:13,549
let's just take a step back.

659
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:17,219
All right? He was behind
Ashley and Ashlyn on the ride...

660
00:49:17,257 --> 00:49:19,350
but there was no ladder here.
You know, there was no rope.

661
00:49:19,393 --> 00:49:21,918
Nothing in that picture pointed to this.

662
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:23,725
We were wrong about the photos.

663
00:49:23,764 --> 00:49:26,631
I should've left town.
It's better not knowing.

664
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:29,660
No, it's never better
staying ignorant.

665
00:49:29,704 --> 00:49:31,763
Willful ignorance
is surrendering control.

666
00:49:32,774 --> 00:49:36,574
What, did you read that somewhere
in Mrs. Brooks' English class?

667
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:40,474
No. L... you know, I'm not...

668
00:49:40,515 --> 00:49:42,881
I'm not the total idiot
you think I am.

669
00:49:44,385 --> 00:49:46,717
OK, that's Lewis after Frank...

670
00:49:46,754 --> 00:49:48,813
then Ian and Erin.

671
00:49:48,856 --> 00:49:50,983
There's a couple of kids behind them,
but I can't make them out...

672
00:49:51,025 --> 00:49:53,084
because this guy's arm's
in the way. Can you?

673
00:49:53,127 --> 00:49:54,116
No.

674
00:49:54,162 --> 00:49:56,027
All right, you know what?

675
00:49:56,063 --> 00:49:58,497
We'll ask Lewis, Ian, and Erin
if they remember.

676
00:49:58,533 --> 00:50:00,091
OK?

677
00:50:00,134 --> 00:50:02,660
Are there any more pictures
from the roller coaster?

678
00:50:15,951 --> 00:50:18,681
I guess...

679
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,278
that kind of thing
is gonna happen to us

680
00:50:20,322 --> 00:50:21,516
for the rest of our lives.

681
00:50:21,557 --> 00:50:23,149
Yeah.

682
00:50:24,626 --> 00:50:26,924
You know, I was gonna...

683
00:50:26,962 --> 00:50:29,123
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

684
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:32,668
Right after graduation.

685
00:50:54,123 --> 00:50:56,091
No, wait.

686
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:57,558
Look, behind Stacy.

687
00:50:58,561 --> 00:50:59,755
That's Frank.

688
00:51:00,897 --> 00:51:02,490
This picture shows how he died.

689
00:51:07,538 --> 00:51:07,902
All right, go back to Lewis.

690
00:51:07,905 --> 00:51:09,896
All right, go back to Lewis.

691
00:51:11,909 --> 00:51:13,342
OK, he's got that hammer.

692
00:51:13,377 --> 00:51:16,244
And the weight looks like
it's coming down...

693
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,077
on his head.

694
00:51:18,115 --> 00:51:19,104
No, no, no, check this out.

695
00:51:19,149 --> 00:51:22,243
Right now Lewis is down at State
for football training camp.

696
00:51:22,286 --> 00:51:24,686
State's team is called the Sultans.

697
00:51:24,721 --> 00:51:26,348
That's it. That's the clue.

698
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,359
We have to tell him.
Show him these pictures.

699
00:51:33,631 --> 00:51:34,655
Wouldn't you want to know?

700
00:51:36,234 --> 00:51:37,599
Wait, there's pictures of us in there?

701
00:51:37,635 --> 00:51:39,330
Yeah.

702
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:40,632
Yeah, of course.

703
00:51:40,672 --> 00:51:42,663
Huh. No.

704
00:51:42,707 --> 00:51:45,471
No. I don't want to see mine.
No.

705
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:46,807
What about willful ignorance?

706
00:51:46,844 --> 00:51:49,506
Well, I'm full of shit, all right?!

707
00:51:49,547 --> 00:51:51,242
I mean, I never thought
I could see my own death...

708
00:51:51,282 --> 00:51:52,544
before it happened, Wendy.

709
00:51:53,718 --> 00:51:55,879
No, you know what?
We can tell Lewis, but...

710
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,889
Seriously, if there's any way
to beat this thing...

711
00:51:58,923 --> 00:52:00,515
I gotta stay focused...

712
00:52:00,558 --> 00:52:02,116
and if I look at that picture,
all I'm gonna do is obsess.

713
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,721
So, you know what?
No, I don't want to see it.

714
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,993
I mean, unless we have to.

715
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:12,732
You mean until we have to.

716
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,337
One more thing.

717
00:52:20,379 --> 00:52:22,347
Is it bad?

718
00:52:22,381 --> 00:52:25,646
I mean, is it, like,
painful or embarrassing?

719
00:52:25,918 --> 00:52:28,182
I mean, there's nothing, like,
up my ass or anything, right?

720
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:29,812
I'll see you tomorrow.

721
00:52:34,726 --> 00:52:36,354
You on crack. Both of you.

722
00:52:36,396 --> 00:52:38,728
Just listen, OK?
Ashley and Ashlyn were first.

723
00:52:38,765 --> 00:52:40,392
Then Frankie Cheeks
and then you. This is the...

724
00:52:40,433 --> 00:52:41,957
- Aw, come on, Kevin.
- Listen.

725
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:43,491
McKinley and Erin
were next, all right?

726
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:45,663
And there were two people in front of us.
Do you remember who they were?

727
00:52:45,705 --> 00:52:47,969
Fuck no, and I don't care.
And you shouldn't care either, man...

728
00:52:48,007 --> 00:52:50,305
'cause what you're tellin' me
right now is straight bullshit.

729
00:52:50,343 --> 00:52:51,401
Just listen, Lewis.

730
00:52:51,444 --> 00:52:53,810
Kevin, it's like those stories.

731
00:52:53,846 --> 00:52:57,680
Like this guy was killed
by a car he sold 10 years ago.

732
00:52:57,717 --> 00:53:01,016
Two sisters, right, were killed when
they were driving to visit each other.

733
00:53:01,054 --> 00:53:03,181
You know, shit like that, man.

734
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,689
Fuck the Bruins!

735
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:06,955
Oh, yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

736
00:53:06,994 --> 00:53:08,757
Bruin faggots!

737
00:53:08,796 --> 00:53:10,388
Yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

738
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,733
Man, you're reading into this shit
like them damn urban legends.

739
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,738
Three people have died, Lewis.

740
00:53:18,772 --> 00:53:20,103
I mean, if you think
this can be written off...

741
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,108
as a simple coincidence
and it ends there...

742
00:53:22,142 --> 00:53:23,973
you're in serious denial.

743
00:53:24,011 --> 00:53:25,501
Unh! What about you two, huh?

744
00:53:25,546 --> 00:53:26,808
What?

745
00:53:26,847 --> 00:53:29,975
You both lost people real close
to you in a fucked-up way.

746
00:53:30,017 --> 00:53:31,951
And in order to feel
less guilty or whatever...

747
00:53:31,986 --> 00:53:33,715
seeing signs and patterns, man.

748
00:53:33,754 --> 00:53:37,521
I don't blame you.
But it's wrong, dawg.

749
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,050
Unh! It's wrong.

750
00:53:41,529 --> 00:53:43,292
That's denial.

751
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:48,533
- Unh!
- You got it!

752
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,834
OK, what about what happened
at the roller coaster? Huh?

753
00:53:50,872 --> 00:53:51,861
Wendy saw it.

754
00:53:51,906 --> 00:53:54,773
Man, she got a hunch.
Fuckin' intense, but she got a hunch.

755
00:53:54,809 --> 00:53:57,243
Man, I'm here because I get
good hunches before every down.

756
00:53:57,278 --> 00:53:59,269
No, you know
they're either gonna run or pass.

757
00:53:59,314 --> 00:54:00,906
Hers came to her from nowhere.

758
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:02,678
You're here and alive because of her.

759
00:54:02,717 --> 00:54:04,207
No, I'm alive because of me.

760
00:54:04,252 --> 00:54:05,776
No, listen.
You don't get it, man.

761
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,185
Does that make sense to you?

762
00:54:07,222 --> 00:54:09,020
There's nothing to get, Kevin!
It's bullshit.

763
00:54:09,058 --> 00:54:10,821
No, just hear me out, all right?

764
00:54:11,927 --> 00:54:13,292
# Yeah #

765
00:54:18,501 --> 00:54:21,527
Talk about a vision.
Man, I seen my whole life played out...

766
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:23,970
and it sure as hell
ain't gonna end now.

767
00:54:24,006 --> 00:54:25,234
It's going just as I saw it.

768
00:54:25,274 --> 00:54:28,505
35 high school games
without an injury.

769
00:54:28,544 --> 00:54:30,876
- USA Today All-American.
- Second team.

770
00:54:30,913 --> 00:54:32,881
- Free ride to play for the Sultans!
- The Bruins passed on you.

771
00:54:32,915 --> 00:54:34,439
Man, fuck the Bruins!

772
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:35,973
- Fuck 'em!
- You goddamn right!

773
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:38,077
What the fuck is a Bruin anyway?

774
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:43,717
Four years from now...

775
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,285
Lewis Romero goin' in
the second round to Oakland.

776
00:54:48,031 --> 00:54:50,158
He's gonna romp and stomp.

777
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,193
15 seasons, with four Super Bowl
rings on his fingers.

778
00:54:54,237 --> 00:54:56,364
Lewis ain't afraid of no death.
Fuck Death!

779
00:54:56,406 --> 00:54:58,806
Death is a fuckin' Denver fan.

780
00:54:58,842 --> 00:55:00,537
Death wear blue and orange.

781
00:55:00,577 --> 00:55:03,375
Real men wear black.

782
00:55:03,413 --> 00:55:04,573
Lewis ain't afraid of no Death.

783
00:55:04,614 --> 00:55:06,912
Death is afraid of me!

784
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:08,417
Death fears me!

785
00:55:08,452 --> 00:55:09,680
Kevin.

786
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:11,813
'Cause, baby, I just win.
I just win, Kevin!

787
00:55:11,856 --> 00:55:15,758
That's all I know how to do!
I just win!

788
00:55:15,793 --> 00:55:17,090
Fuck Death!

789
00:55:17,128 --> 00:55:19,062
- Fuck the Bruins!
- Yeah!

790
00:55:21,032 --> 00:55:22,465
- Look out!
- Lewis!

791
00:55:24,602 --> 00:55:26,069
Man, that was close, Lewis.

792
00:55:26,104 --> 00:55:28,095
Hey, did you see that?

793
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:31,597
Whoo! What I tell you,
Kevin, huh?

794
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fuck Death! I just win!
That's all I know
how to do, Kevin.
Baby, I just win!
God!

795
00:55:50,462 --> 00:55:52,930
Did I do something...

796
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:56,794
to bring this on everybody?

797
00:55:56,834 --> 00:55:58,927
Don't, Wendy.

798
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:01,962
But why me?

799
00:56:02,006 --> 00:56:04,270
All those people out there
wanting to have a premonition...

800
00:56:04,308 --> 00:56:07,141
or see a ghost or whatever,
and I don't.

801
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:13,012
I just want it to stop.

802
00:56:13,051 --> 00:56:14,882
Just stop.

803
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,616
I don't know why, Wendy...

804
00:56:17,656 --> 00:56:20,216
but you didn't do anything.

805
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,885
All right? This is just...

806
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:25,829
I don't know. I mean,
I wish I knew why, you know?

807
00:56:25,864 --> 00:56:28,594
I wish I could... I could
come up with a guess even...

808
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:30,828
to make you feel OK, but...

809
00:56:33,305 --> 00:56:35,705
You know, I can't.

810
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,409
Yeah.

811
00:56:40,412 --> 00:56:42,073
There's nothing I can do.

812
00:56:46,452 --> 00:56:47,885
Can you drive?

813
00:56:50,523 --> 00:56:51,785
Yeah.

814
00:56:56,596 --> 00:56:58,188
You know, by the way,
that... that picture of me.

815
00:56:58,231 --> 00:57:02,531
My, uh, my head's not, like,
through the windshield or anything?

816
00:57:02,568 --> 00:57:04,934
You know,
crushed by a steering wheel?

817
00:57:04,971 --> 00:57:06,802
Impaled by a gear shift?

818
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,303
Right?

819
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:26,754
Zip, it's Pip.

820
00:57:26,794 --> 00:57:28,227
Have you cut
those plywood orders yet?

821
00:57:28,262 --> 00:57:29,752
Uh, that's a big no, Pip.

822
00:57:29,797 --> 00:57:33,164
Osama bin Supervisor wants me
to get rid of these pigeons first.

823
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,792
They keep settin' off the alarms.

824
00:57:47,915 --> 00:57:49,940
Hello, babies.

825
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,699
Hey. After I, uh, restock
this stuff...

826
00:58:11,737 --> 00:58:13,728
that these pinhead customers
can't manage...

827
00:58:13,772 --> 00:58:15,673
to return to the shelves
themselves...

828
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:17,107
we can blow out of here, OK?

829
00:58:17,143 --> 00:58:18,770
Righty-o, babe.

830
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Erin, it's Wendy and Kevin.

831
00:58:26,052 --> 00:58:27,644
Shit!

832
00:58:27,687 --> 00:58:29,587
You scared the shit out of me!

833
00:58:29,622 --> 00:58:31,817
Yeah, wait till you hear
what we have to tell you.

834
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,335
Zip, it's Pip. Come over here.

835
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:46,099
You are gonna trip
when you hear this.

836
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:49,337
Well, paint me intrigued, Pip.
I'm on my way.

837
00:58:49,376 --> 00:58:52,812
So let me get this straight.
I'm gonna O.D. On nail polish...

838
00:58:52,847 --> 00:58:55,816
and Ian is gonna be
embarrassed to death?

839
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,477
You saw what happened
to Wendy, right?

840
00:58:57,518 --> 00:59:00,419
What's happened to the others?
I mean, you just saw their pictures.

841
00:59:10,998 --> 00:59:13,432
Oh, my God, guys,
what's going on?

842
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,732
What's going on?
That's crazy! That's crazy!

843
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:22,404
We need to know who was sitting
behind you on the roller coaster.

844
00:59:22,444 --> 00:59:25,811
OK, who was sitting behind us
on the roller coaster?

845
00:59:25,847 --> 00:59:28,816
Oh! Oh, wait! Wasn't it
that one guy who got voted...

846
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:31,683
most likely to become
manager at Red Lobster?

847
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,914
Oh, no. You know what?
God, I remember.

848
00:59:32,954 --> 00:59:34,717
There was this guy,
uh, black cloak...

849
00:59:34,756 --> 00:59:36,280
I didn't see his face, but, um...

850
00:59:36,324 --> 00:59:38,519
the ride attendant
did take his sickle...

851
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,927
before the ride started
if that's helpful in any way.

852
00:59:41,963 --> 00:59:43,828
Do you think we care
if you laugh at us?

853
00:59:43,865 --> 00:59:45,355
This is our lives, OK?

854
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,664
What choice do we have?
Just give into it?

855
00:59:47,702 --> 00:59:49,500
Oh, God. You know what?
There is no "it."

856
00:59:49,538 --> 00:59:52,439
OK, wait, are you guys saying
that Death is, like, a person?

857
00:59:52,475 --> 00:59:55,103
No. It's like... like a force.

858
00:59:55,144 --> 00:59:58,841
Yeah. Well, you know what?
A force is just a force.

859
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:01,349
It's nothing else.
Just transferred energy.

860
01:00:01,384 --> 01:00:04,842
I mean, it has no goals,
no awareness that is a force.

861
01:00:04,887 --> 01:00:06,548
But there is awareness, McKinley.

862
01:00:06,589 --> 01:00:09,023
In fact, in past cases,
if the next in line is saved...

863
01:00:09,058 --> 01:00:11,322
it'd skip that person.
That's why we're here.

864
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,123
Oh, man,
what have you been smoking?

865
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:22,171
- Top shelf.
- OK.

866
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,910
Kevin! Those banners.
They're in the picture.

867
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:36,075
Lan, watch those boxes!

868
01:00:41,224 --> 01:00:44,057
What the fuck, man?
You said those boxes were falling!

869
01:00:44,094 --> 01:00:45,857
No, I said watch the boxes.

870
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:47,523
Really? What for?
They're not doing anything.

871
01:00:47,564 --> 01:00:50,500
We're not gonna apologize
for trying to save you.

872
01:00:50,535 --> 01:00:54,403
You haven't seen or been through
what we have... yet.

873
01:00:54,439 --> 01:00:56,031
Oh. Yet.

874
01:00:56,074 --> 01:00:59,305
OK, so who's next in this theory
you have, me or Ian?

875
01:00:59,344 --> 01:01:01,710
Well, we know the order of how
we were sitting on the roller coaster...

876
01:01:01,746 --> 01:01:04,180
but not how it works
with people who sat together.

877
01:01:04,215 --> 01:01:07,013
OK, we don't know
if Ashley or Ashlyn died first.

878
01:01:07,051 --> 01:01:09,679
Hmm. God, Death is
fucking complicated.

879
01:01:11,189 --> 01:01:13,282
No, you know what?
It's not complicated.

880
01:01:13,324 --> 01:01:15,884
It's simple. People die.

881
01:01:15,927 --> 01:01:17,326
That's just part of life.

882
01:01:17,362 --> 01:01:20,126
150,000 people a day, actually.

883
01:01:20,164 --> 01:01:22,065
You know? I mean...

884
01:01:22,101 --> 01:01:24,126
we're biological entities,
and death is just...

885
01:01:24,169 --> 01:01:26,467
- Top shelf.
- The end of biological function.

886
01:01:26,505 --> 01:01:27,494
It's as simple as that.

887
01:01:34,413 --> 01:01:36,881
How can you explain
what happened to us as simple?

888
01:01:36,915 --> 01:01:38,712
I mean, if Wendy never had
that premonition...

889
01:01:38,751 --> 01:01:41,242
and none of us had gotten off that ride,
we'd all be dead right now.

890
01:01:41,286 --> 01:01:43,618
- Does that not make sense to you?
- Oh, yeah.

891
01:01:43,655 --> 01:01:47,557
Kevin, how come when a guy dies
of a plain heart attack...

892
01:01:47,593 --> 01:01:49,220
no one goes, like...

893
01:01:49,261 --> 01:01:52,389
"Oh, wow, he was
eating French toast...

894
01:01:52,432 --> 01:01:54,229
"when Princess Diana
died in Paris...

895
01:01:54,267 --> 01:01:57,430
"and then he saw her funeral on TV,
and now he's dead"?

896
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:58,994
You know why?
Because they'd sound crazy...

897
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,497
so guess how you two
sound right now? Crazy.

898
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:04,942
Zip, I'm done.
So finish cutting those orders...

899
01:02:04,978 --> 01:02:06,309
- so we can get out of here.
- OK!

900
01:03:13,314 --> 01:03:14,906
Sick.

901
01:03:50,185 --> 01:03:52,016
OK.

902
01:03:52,054 --> 01:03:54,022
Let's go with
what you guys are saying.

903
01:03:54,056 --> 01:03:55,353
Let's just say, you know...

904
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:57,825
that Death does have
a conscious plan...

905
01:03:57,861 --> 01:04:00,193
and that it's been
set into motion. Great.

906
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:03,393
So, Newton's third law of motion,
and, well, look...

907
01:04:03,433 --> 01:04:05,264
I'm just guessing
that it goes for Death, too...

908
01:04:05,301 --> 01:04:07,132
when he's working in our world.

909
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:11,106
Newton says that every action
has an equal and opposite reaction.

910
01:04:11,141 --> 01:04:14,201
So, that means that...

911
01:04:14,244 --> 01:04:18,146
if Death has taken action,
so can we.

912
01:04:18,181 --> 01:04:20,376
And that that action
we take might have...

913
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:22,976
an opposite reaction
that thwarts Death's intent.

914
01:04:23,019 --> 01:04:24,748
You're being a fucker, but go on.

915
01:04:24,787 --> 01:04:27,655
OK. OK.

916
01:04:27,691 --> 01:04:30,922
What if, for example...

917
01:04:30,961 --> 01:04:35,762
the last in line were to make
the utilitarian choice...

918
01:04:37,101 --> 01:04:38,261
Kill themselves.

919
01:04:40,437 --> 01:04:42,871
Wow! Wow! That's pretty much
gonna ruin any plan...

920
01:04:42,907 --> 01:04:45,603
that Death's put in motion.
And even better...

921
01:04:45,643 --> 01:04:49,511
hey, it's gonna save
five skipped lives.

922
01:04:55,619 --> 01:04:57,211
Any takers?

923
01:04:59,824 --> 01:05:02,122
Nah, I didn't think so.

924
01:05:11,803 --> 01:05:13,270
There! Those!

925
01:06:12,165 --> 01:06:14,292
I didn't say anything.
I mean, I think...

926
01:06:14,334 --> 01:06:15,801
they were trying to scare us
into saying something...

927
01:06:15,836 --> 01:06:17,827
but they had nothing
to keep me there.

928
01:06:17,871 --> 01:06:19,304
What'd you tell 'em?

929
01:06:19,339 --> 01:06:21,569
Everything.
I didn't do anything.

930
01:06:21,608 --> 01:06:23,405
I told them about
the pictures in the camera...

931
01:06:23,443 --> 01:06:24,603
and Flight 180
and Frankie and Lewis...

932
01:06:24,645 --> 01:06:27,011
and why we went to see
Ian and Erin and...

933
01:06:27,047 --> 01:06:28,480
Did they believe you?

934
01:06:28,515 --> 01:06:30,540
Yeah, right.
Would you believe me?

935
01:06:30,584 --> 01:06:33,076
No, they looked at me
like I was crazy.

936
01:06:33,121 --> 01:06:35,555
10 hours they had us in there.

937
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:36,955
For all we know...

938
01:06:36,991 --> 01:06:38,856
whoever was sitting
behind Erin is already dead.

939
01:06:38,893 --> 01:06:40,451
And we're next.

940
01:06:40,495 --> 01:06:42,019
Now.

941
01:06:44,866 --> 01:06:48,962
Lan almost died first,
but we intervened.

942
01:06:49,003 --> 01:06:52,370
So it skipped Ian.
That's... that's how we regain control.

943
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:53,704
If someone intercedes...

944
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:55,606
the life that was supposed
to be next is skipped.

945
01:06:55,643 --> 01:06:56,871
All right, wait, wait, wait.

946
01:06:56,911 --> 01:06:59,402
So, going by the way we sat
on the roller coaster...

947
01:07:00,882 --> 01:07:04,046
Well, I'm next... and then you.

948
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:07,249
We can beat this.

949
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:10,053
We're so close.
We can't give up.

950
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:14,524
All right, my dad's here.
He's gonna give me a ride back.

951
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:17,532
But are you sure
we shouldn't stick together?

952
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,431
It's just for a couple of hours.

953
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:20,457
All right? A couple of hours.

954
01:07:20,502 --> 01:07:23,437
Go back, look at the pictures,
see if you can find any more clues...

955
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:27,203
and I'll ask everybody I see if they know
if anyone else got off the ride.

956
01:07:27,242 --> 01:07:29,301
OK?

957
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:33,946
Was there something
I should know about going?

958
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,946
No, it's just...

959
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:40,478
I'll just be freaking out
every second...

960
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:42,457
hoping you're OK.

961
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,483
Why?

962
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:47,696
I mean,
we don't even like each other.

963
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:52,924
Come here.

964
01:07:57,974 --> 01:07:59,168
OK?

965
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,971
All right, I got my cell.

966
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,307
OK.

967
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,692
Hey, Wen?

968
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:23,494
So we're meeting some guys
at that centennial thing...

969
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:27,697
and I could really use
my good-luck... bracelet.

970
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,468
Hey, this is Julie.
Leave a message.

971
01:09:32,504 --> 01:09:34,404
Call me on my cell right away.

972
01:09:39,946 --> 01:09:41,208
Hello?

973
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,147
Do you remember Julie
being on the roller coaster?

974
01:09:43,182 --> 01:09:45,013
What, your sister? No.

975
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:46,382
No, she would've said
something by now.

976
01:09:46,419 --> 01:09:47,977
The person sitting
behind Ian and Erin...

977
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:49,648
was wearing the exact same
charm bracelet...

978
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:51,418
our grandmother gave her.

979
01:09:51,457 --> 01:09:53,448
Amber or Perry
were probably with her...

980
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:55,222
so they're next.

981
01:09:55,261 --> 01:09:56,626
I gotta find Julie.

982
01:09:56,663 --> 01:09:57,755
She went to
the tricentennial thing.

983
01:09:57,797 --> 01:09:59,788
Well, I... I'm here now,
working security.

984
01:09:59,832 --> 01:10:01,459
I'll start looking for her.

985
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:03,435
- I'm on my way.
- Wen, wait.

986
01:10:03,469 --> 01:10:05,164
Look, after them, we're next.

987
01:10:05,204 --> 01:10:07,468
So in case somethin'
happens to 'em...

988
01:10:07,507 --> 01:10:09,169
before we meet up...

989
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:10,938
remember that time
we talked about?

990
01:10:10,978 --> 01:10:12,673
When to look at our pictures?

991
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:14,442
It's now.

992
01:10:24,024 --> 01:10:25,753
Great. Mine has no clue.

993
01:10:25,793 --> 01:10:28,557
It's just me standing in front of
a blank background...

994
01:10:28,595 --> 01:10:30,961
with Jason at
the amusement park.

995
01:10:30,998 --> 01:10:33,967
Wait. McKinley.

996
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:37,095
Lan? Is he in the picture?

997
01:10:37,137 --> 01:10:40,733
No, but it... it feels like a clue.

998
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:44,342
And yours is the picture
that I took...

999
01:10:44,379 --> 01:10:46,108
when I flashed the camera
in your face.

1000
01:10:46,147 --> 01:10:50,106
It's all out of focus
and overexposed, like...

1001
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:57,385
Like a firework
went off in my face?

1002
01:11:22,918 --> 01:11:26,115
# There is someone #

1003
01:11:26,155 --> 01:11:29,283
# Walking behind you #

1004
01:11:32,528 --> 01:11:35,759
# Look at me #

1005
01:11:35,798 --> 01:11:37,629
# There is someone #

1006
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:41,569
# Watching your footsteps #

1007
01:11:44,307 --> 01:11:46,207
# Look at me #

1008
01:11:47,811 --> 01:11:51,178
# There is someone #

1009
01:11:51,214 --> 01:11:53,444
# Who really loves you #

1010
01:11:53,483 --> 01:11:55,610
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

1011
01:11:58,221 --> 01:11:59,813
Get 'em while they're hot!

1012
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:06,689
Take it to those Redcoats!

1013
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:09,028
Column, advance!

1014
01:12:21,078 --> 01:12:22,978
The kite is aloft.

1015
01:12:24,448 --> 01:12:27,246
Now, let us hope
for some lightning.

1016
01:12:27,285 --> 01:12:29,845
Fuck you, Ben Franklin.

1017
01:12:38,095 --> 01:12:41,292
But he kept insisting.
"Get over here," right?

1018
01:12:43,502 --> 01:12:45,595
This is awesome, dude!

1019
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:49,773
Come on!

1020
01:12:49,808 --> 01:12:51,799
Hey, get out of here with those, man!
You're gonna set these off!

1021
01:12:51,844 --> 01:12:53,311
Hurry, dude.

1022
01:12:53,345 --> 01:12:54,744
Come on, man, let's go!
Hurry up!

1023
01:12:56,248 --> 01:12:59,979
Ladies and gentlemen,
to celebrate McKinley's tricentennial...

1024
01:13:00,018 --> 01:13:02,748
the fireworks extravaganza
will begin shortly.

1025
01:13:07,893 --> 01:13:09,417
Oh, my God. Julie.

1026
01:13:09,461 --> 01:13:10,428
- What?
- Look.

1027
01:13:10,462 --> 01:13:12,362
There's Kahlil.

1028
01:13:12,397 --> 01:13:13,990
Should we?

1029
01:13:14,033 --> 01:13:15,694
Hey, guys. I'm sorry,
but you can't be here, OK?

1030
01:13:15,735 --> 01:13:18,033
The viewing site is over there.
You too, sir. Come on.

1031
01:13:18,071 --> 01:13:19,902
They're not gonna
make us move, are they?

1032
01:13:19,939 --> 01:13:21,531
I don't fucking believe them.

1033
01:13:21,574 --> 01:13:24,065
OK, we gotta clear out.

1034
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:32,140
Excuse me.

1035
01:13:57,278 --> 01:13:58,802
- Ladies.
- Boys.

1036
01:13:58,846 --> 01:13:59,835
What's going on?

1037
01:14:01,048 --> 01:14:02,879
Hey, Julie.

1038
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:05,351
- You three need to come with me.
- What did we do?

1039
01:14:05,386 --> 01:14:07,081
Look, it's for your own safety,
Julie, all right?

1040
01:14:07,121 --> 01:14:08,952
I'll tell you about it as soon as
we get away from here, OK?

1041
01:14:08,989 --> 01:14:10,820
Let go of me!

1042
01:14:10,858 --> 01:14:11,916
Julie.

1043
01:14:13,193 --> 01:14:14,353
Julie!

1044
01:14:44,726 --> 01:14:46,159
Sweet.

1045
01:14:49,432 --> 01:14:50,421
Yeah!

1046
01:14:53,769 --> 01:14:55,031
Light it! Light it!
Go, go, go, man!

1047
01:15:00,776 --> 01:15:02,573
Julie!

1048
01:15:12,254 --> 01:15:13,812
- Oh, shit!
- Dude, we gotta bail!

1049
01:15:33,443 --> 01:15:36,640
Julie! No, wait, wait.

1050
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:39,148
You're in danger, OK?
I'm trying to explain something.

1051
01:15:39,182 --> 01:15:41,912
Let me explain this to you.

1052
01:15:45,822 --> 01:15:47,255
Julie, look out!

1053
01:15:53,798 --> 01:15:54,890
Julie!

1054
01:16:01,205 --> 01:16:02,729
Cut him off!

1055
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:28,497
OK, OK.

1056
01:16:30,869 --> 01:16:32,234
Stay back! He's dangerous!

1057
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:36,800
I got him.

1058
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:39,037
- Just let me go.
- No, Julie.

1059
01:16:39,078 --> 01:16:40,272
You have to tell me,
you have to listen.

1060
01:16:40,312 --> 01:16:42,576
Tell me who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

1061
01:16:42,614 --> 01:16:44,479
Oh, my God,
Julie, are you all right?

1062
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:47,482
Listen to me!
You have to tell me...

1063
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,384
who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

1064
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Who? She's next!

1065
01:17:10,443 --> 01:17:11,774
Kevin.

1066
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:25,051
Fire!

1067
01:17:25,092 --> 01:17:27,287
Kevin.

1068
01:17:27,328 --> 01:17:30,855
You saved my life.

1069
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:37,969
Thanks for that, McKinley.

1070
01:17:38,005 --> 01:17:39,973
- Shut up, McKinley!
- No!

1071
01:17:40,007 --> 01:17:41,474
We have to get out of here now.

1072
01:17:41,509 --> 01:17:42,669
What's the deal?

1073
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:45,304
Lan McKinley.
He causes my death.

1074
01:17:45,346 --> 01:17:47,473
In my picture I was wearing
the McKinley grad night shirt.

1075
01:17:47,515 --> 01:17:49,278
- He's the clue.
- What?

1076
01:17:49,316 --> 01:17:51,307
There's a first aid tent,
there should be security.

1077
01:17:53,488 --> 01:17:55,456
Get the fuck outta here, McKinley!

1078
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:59,551
Hey, I'm just celebrating
our town's tricentennial.

1079
01:18:02,664 --> 01:18:03,722
You followed me!

1080
01:18:03,765 --> 01:18:05,665
Oh! You are paranoid.

1081
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:07,759
But, hey, I saw what happened.

1082
01:18:07,802 --> 01:18:10,566
You're next, right?
You're the end of it, aren't you?

1083
01:18:10,605 --> 01:18:12,004
Man, I would be paranoid, too.

1084
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,837
You didn't even believe me!

1085
01:18:13,875 --> 01:18:16,935
Yeah, well, seeing is believing.

1086
01:18:16,978 --> 01:18:18,673
Then you have
to stay away from me!

1087
01:18:18,713 --> 01:18:21,944
"Have to"?
Wow, that's extreme.

1088
01:18:26,656 --> 01:18:28,783
Oh, no way.

1089
01:18:30,459 --> 01:18:32,154
Do I cause your death?

1090
01:18:33,829 --> 01:18:35,763
Just like you caused Erin's?

1091
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,790
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what? What?

1092
01:18:38,834 --> 01:18:41,701
You have a vision? Was I in it?

1093
01:18:41,737 --> 01:18:43,637
Was I in a picture?

1094
01:18:45,908 --> 01:18:48,342
Just tell me how to start it off!

1095
01:18:48,377 --> 01:18:51,039
Let's get this over with!

1096
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,810
You'll save me
if you just stay away!

1097
01:18:53,849 --> 01:18:55,147
Then it'll all be over!

1098
01:18:55,185 --> 01:18:58,154
What do I care? It skipped me.

1099
01:18:58,188 --> 01:18:59,985
For me, it is over.
I'm not dying.

1100
01:19:00,023 --> 01:19:02,890
I'm not dying!

1101
01:19:15,138 --> 01:19:17,197
You see?

1102
01:19:17,241 --> 01:19:18,503
I'm not gonna die!

1103
01:19:18,542 --> 01:19:20,840
It's you, Wendy! You're dead!

1104
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,677
# Came back down
from this fight #

1105
01:19:59,717 --> 01:20:01,207
- Hi!
- # Will get ya deeper #

1106
01:20:01,252 --> 01:20:02,617
# And make you right #

1107
01:20:02,653 --> 01:20:03,677
Thank you.

1108
01:20:03,721 --> 01:20:06,485
# Bruno's drops
threaten her... #

1109
01:20:06,524 --> 01:20:07,752
Wait, what about
that great curry place?

1110
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:09,191
Don't we get off at Booth?

1111
01:20:09,227 --> 01:20:11,092
Oh, you mean Gupta's.
You get off at Oswald.

1112
01:20:11,128 --> 01:20:12,686
Oh, that's right.

1113
01:20:13,931 --> 01:20:16,399
You know, if I can't be home
for Thanksgiving...

1114
01:20:16,433 --> 01:20:19,197
I need some semblance
of a traditional dinner.

1115
01:20:19,235 --> 01:20:21,430
Turkey, stuffing, pie.

1116
01:20:21,704 --> 01:20:23,001
If you don't have turkey
for one Thanksgiving...

1117
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:24,666
is that really gonna kill you?

1118
01:20:25,675 --> 01:20:28,804
# There is someone #

1119
01:20:28,845 --> 01:20:32,303
# Walking behind you #

1120
01:20:32,349 --> 01:20:35,648
# Turn around #

1121
01:20:35,686 --> 01:20:39,383
# Look at me #

1122
01:20:39,423 --> 01:20:42,790
# There is someone #

1123
01:20:42,826 --> 01:20:46,694
# Watching your footsteps #

1124
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:47,992
# Turn around #

1125
01:20:55,539 --> 01:20:58,805
# There is someone #

1126
01:20:58,843 --> 01:21:02,973
# Who really needs you #

1127
01:21:03,014 --> 01:21:05,881
# Here's my heart #

1128
01:21:40,452 --> 01:21:41,817
This is Booth Street.

1129
01:21:41,854 --> 01:21:46,291
Next stop is Oswald.
End of the line.

1130
01:21:46,325 --> 01:21:50,386
The next stop
is the end of the line.

1131
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:54,194
Wendy! Next stop after this.

1132
01:21:54,233 --> 01:21:56,497
- Let's just walk.
- It's freezing out.

1133
01:21:56,535 --> 01:21:58,162
Yeah, but the air'll feel good.

1134
01:21:58,203 --> 01:22:00,968
I could use some air.

1135
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:06,070
Yeah!

1136
01:22:06,412 --> 01:22:07,340
Yeah, man!

1137
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,711
All right, man. See ya.

1138
01:22:08,748 --> 01:22:09,772
Let's go, Bruins!

1139
01:22:09,816 --> 01:22:10,805
Bruins, yeah!

1140
01:22:26,699 --> 01:22:28,223
Hey, man, peace out!

1141
01:22:28,268 --> 01:22:29,792
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

1142
01:22:29,836 --> 01:22:32,237
- Watch out!
- Hey, Bruins!

1143
01:22:32,273 --> 01:22:34,264
You missed the beginning.
Did you see that?

1144
01:22:34,308 --> 01:22:35,434
This is it!

1145
01:22:35,476 --> 01:22:39,105
Yo, comin' through. Excuse me.

1146
01:22:41,148 --> 01:22:43,082
Oh, my God.

1147
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:47,850
I can't believe this. Here.

1148
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:52,559
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1149
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:55,255
I thought you weren't
coming till tonight.

1150
01:22:55,296 --> 01:22:57,730
Well, Dad's car just, like,
dies out of nowhere...

1151
01:22:57,765 --> 01:22:59,562
and he couldn't get it fixed
anywhere on a holiday...

1152
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,965
so instead of sitting around
for a few hours...

1153
01:23:01,001 --> 01:23:02,936
I lucked out and caught
an early train.

1154
01:23:02,971 --> 01:23:04,734
I hope I'm not messing you up or...

1155
01:23:04,773 --> 01:23:06,934
No, no, it's just, um...

1156
01:23:06,975 --> 01:23:10,706
I think I had a sense
that you were coming now.

1157
01:23:14,616 --> 01:23:17,050
I was just...

1158
01:23:17,085 --> 01:23:20,418
I was feeling like I did that night.

1159
01:23:21,423 --> 01:23:23,414
No. No, it's over.

1160
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:26,325
You, me, Kevin went over
a thousand scenarios.

1161
01:23:26,361 --> 01:23:27,658
Lan was gonna cause your death...

1162
01:23:27,696 --> 01:23:29,493
you intervened,
and it skipped us.

1163
01:23:36,172 --> 01:23:38,902
Look, I'm not worried.

1164
01:23:38,941 --> 01:23:41,876
I ran into Kevin at home.
He's not worried.

1165
01:23:41,911 --> 01:23:43,173
And, if I were you...

1166
01:23:43,212 --> 01:23:45,578
until something happens
to me and then Kevin...

1167
01:23:45,615 --> 01:23:47,242
you've got nothing
to worry about.

1168
01:23:48,584 --> 01:23:50,415
You're right.

1169
01:23:52,321 --> 01:23:54,482
Hey, I... I want you to meet
my roommate and my friend, OK?

1170
01:23:54,523 --> 01:23:55,615
Yeah.

1171
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,959
Hey, guys. This is Julie, my...

1172
01:24:10,607 --> 01:24:12,939
What are you doing here?

1173
01:24:12,976 --> 01:24:15,171
Wendy! Julie!

1174
01:24:15,212 --> 01:24:17,112
What are the chances?

1175
01:24:17,147 --> 01:24:18,512
How long have you been
on this train?

1176
01:24:18,548 --> 01:24:20,140
Uh, since home.

1177
01:24:20,183 --> 01:24:22,014
I was headin' up
to check out the game.

1178
01:24:22,052 --> 01:24:23,610
I was gonna look you up
afterwards.

1179
01:24:26,223 --> 01:24:27,451
You OK?

1180
01:24:27,491 --> 01:24:29,254
Is something wrong?

1181
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:09,190
Julie, stay down!

1182
01:25:09,234 --> 01:25:11,464
Julie!

1183
01:25:17,643 --> 01:25:19,110
Kevin!

1184
01:25:22,815 --> 01:25:24,646
Oh, God!

1185
01:26:36,557 --> 01:26:40,153
No!

1186
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:43,494
I was gonna look you up
afterwards, but...

1187
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:45,958
You OK?

1188
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:48,492
Is somethin' wrong?

1189
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:51,766
The train...

1190
01:26:51,807 --> 01:26:54,833
Oh, shit. Not again.

1191
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:56,468
We gotta get out!

1192
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:59,537
It's not working.
Somebody stop the train!
