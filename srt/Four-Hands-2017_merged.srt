00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,761
Calm down!
He won't hurt you!

3
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,640
What are you doing?
Put the knife away! Put the knife away!

4
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,560
No! Leave her!

5
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,400
Leave her! Leave her!

6
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,680
Stop it! Stop it!

7
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:54,035
Stop it!

8
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,200
I'm watching over you.

9
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,600
FOUR HANDS

10
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,560
20 YEARS LATER

11
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,640
Hey, sis.

12
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:09,120
You're right.

13
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:10,920
Okay?

14
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,200
I'll get some help again.

15
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,520
Sorry about the last few weeks.

16
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,240
I'll go and knock some socks off.
-You do that.

17
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,480
Your phone.

18
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:13,761
Hello, Ms Tauber.
This is Routers Attourney's office.

19
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,680
You wanted us to let you know
and now it's happened.

20
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,120
The offenders were released last week.
Both the man and the woman.

21
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:23,720
If you have any...

22
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

23
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:28,892
Oh dear... Crazy enough
to listen to the competition too?

24
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:31,013
She made a mistake.

25
00:07:50,572 --> 00:07:51,733
They got out.

26
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:55,892
Sometime this week.

27
00:07:57,732 --> 00:07:59,892
Okay, now sit down.

28
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:05,692
They're not dangerous.
They've served their time.

29
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,572
They don't even know us.

30
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:11,252
Okay?

31
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:14,533
This audition is very important to me.
You have to calm down, Jessy!

32
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:20,013
They'll live in this town again.
-They're not dangerous.

33
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:22,692
You're just scared. Just calm down.

34
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:26,013
Let go of me.
-Okay...

35
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:29,092
Sit down. It's fine.
-Sorry, you're...

36
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:31,451
Just sit down.
Look at me.

37
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:33,693
Look at me. Let him be, Jessy.

38
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:37,452
Okay, thanks.
-Let him be.

39
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:40,212
Thank you. Now get home safely.

40
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:41,373
Ms Tauber?

41
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,853
Are you there?

42
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:53,372
Something's come up. I'm sorry.

43
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:56,852
She's sorry.

44
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,573
Keys.

45
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:25,133
How can you think about playing piano
when they're running free?

46
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:31,013
I won't let anyone hurt you.

47
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:35,293
Shut up!

48
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:40,253
Get in.

49
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,093
Get in.

50
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,959
Hey!

51
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,959
Help me, please!
-Take it easy...

52
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,239
Okay, okay...

53
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,599
Stop! Stop!

54
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,079
Let go of me!

55
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,999
Hello?

56
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,000
Hello?

57
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:14,039
Hey, hey. Stop right there...

58
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,919
Take it easy now. Come with me.

59
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,199
Where's my sister?
-Take it easy now.

60
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,319
Are you in pain?

61
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,359
Do you know where you are?

62
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,319
Do you understand me?

63
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,159
Where's my sister?

64
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:35,399
Take a seat.

65
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:43,799
This isn't my ward,
but I'll find the doctor in charge.

66
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,439
I'm sorry.

67
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,239
I want to see her.

68
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,320
You need some rest.
-I want to see my sister.

69
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:17,919
Did you understand what I said?

70
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,479
This isn't my ward.

71
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,199
And I didn't treat your sister.

72
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,159
Please.

73
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:48,639
Wait a moment.

74
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:20,679
She died before we could do anything.

75
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:33,080
Can I call someone for you?

76
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:17,319
AUTHORISATION FOR CREMATION

77
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:45,276
Ms Tauber?

78
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:48,755
Okay.

79
00:14:50,115 --> 00:14:53,395
No one is to blame for the accident
and I can close the case.

80
00:14:58,236 --> 00:14:59,956
There's another matter.

81
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:05,156
I saw Maria Uchwat today
and told her she could press charges.

82
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:08,436
She didn't want to.
-What do you mean?

83
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:22,116
"If you don't leave town
as soon as you get out of prison,

84
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:23,835
you'll pay for it."

85
00:15:26,035 --> 00:15:27,596
My sister wrote that.

86
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:32,475
It's her handwriting.

87
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,995
So there won't be
any more letters like this, then?

88
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,956
Could you hand this in for me?

89
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:50,396
My sympathies.

90
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:14,195
I'm watching over you.

91
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:38,115
Hello.

92
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:44,356
Catching some fresh air too?
Or running away?

93
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,836
Fresh air...

94
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,036
But it's too chilly, huh?

95
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:53,676
Exactly.
-Shall we go in?

96
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:59,756
Can I grab you for a sec?
What shall we do about patient 305?

97
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:03,676
I'm not on duty right now, actually.
Maybe ask Beate.

98
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,316
She'll know.
-Okay.

99
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:07,076
Will do.

100
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,196
It fell on the floor.

101
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:19,036
Frankly,
I wouldn't let you go yet.

102
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:22,796
I'm just a bit...

103
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:26,876
Want something to help you sleep?

104
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,956
Okay.

105
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,595
That thing with the cigarette...

106
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,635
That was pretty mean.

107
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,876
Well, it's kind of a habit of mine.

108
00:18:44,836 --> 00:18:49,276
Because the brain only saves moments
worth remembering.

109
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:52,116
So every day, I try to have...

110
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:55,436
a kind of mini adventure.

111
00:18:57,556 --> 00:19:00,796
Firecrackers may be childish
but you remember that kind of crap.

112
00:19:02,116 --> 00:19:04,516
And life consists of memories.

113
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,209
And with more memories
I'm kind of extending my life.

114
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,450
And other people's lives.

115
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,410
If they let you out tomorrow and...

116
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:19,901
you have no one to talk to...

117
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:22,930
then just get in touch, okay?

118
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:29,250
Martin.
-Yep.

119
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,650
Sophie.
-Okay.

120
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,969
Thanks for the second chance.

121
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,130
You should thank
our inability to organise.

122
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,050
Please begin.

123
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:20,245
It's always a question of balance,
between reception and reflection.

124
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:26,212
But everything in life is about balance,
so what I said is nonsense really.

125
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:48,373
Welcome to our team, Ms Tauber.

126
00:21:48,693 --> 00:21:51,732
Thank you.
-You're welcome.

127
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:10,453
Lucky we brought our parasol, huh?
-You thought of everything.

128
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:13,493
Listen, no bikes, no motorbikes...

129
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:18,573
So does this count as an adventure?
-Of course.

130
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:21,573
YOU HONK, WE DRINK

131
00:22:21,613 --> 00:22:25,413
Must be your most unpleasant date ever.
-Sure is.

132
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:27,493
But you won't forget it, huh?

133
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:31,092
Being afraid of flying
isn't embarrassing.

134
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:32,733
Not embarrassing, but...

135
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:37,013
But I'd like to have seen
a bit more of the world.

136
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:39,973
What might possibly be embarrassing is...

137
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:44,213
Sinistrophobia.
Fear of left-handed people.

138
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:47,613
Yes. Just imagine...

139
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:51,414
Any person you meet
could be left-handed.

140
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:55,094
Everyone is potentially left-handed.

141
00:22:56,254 --> 00:22:57,974
So...

142
00:22:58,014 --> 00:23:00,094
Are you left-handed?

143
00:23:02,054 --> 00:23:05,014
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.
-Why?

144
00:23:05,574 --> 00:23:07,534
You can see it.
-How?

145
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:10,374
By looking at a person's fingers.

146
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:12,814
Ah, right.

147
00:23:44,774 --> 00:23:46,214
What's wrong?

148
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,294
What's up?

149
00:23:50,654 --> 00:23:51,934
Sophie!

150
00:24:31,214 --> 00:24:32,294
I'll find you...

151
00:25:27,006 --> 00:25:30,885
Ms Tauber, you can't take out any more.
Your account's overdrawn.

152
00:25:30,925 --> 00:25:33,565
But there should be
over 3,000 euros.

153
00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:37,245
If you want to withdraw more,
we need to talk about a loan.

154
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:40,046
We have to apply for one and see

155
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:43,805
whether your monthly income
will cover it.

156
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:47,726
Are you okay?

157
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:09,165
OSTPARK STREET

158
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:01,885
Hello?
-Finally, I've got through.

159
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:09,046
I wanted... I wanted to say sorry.
-For what?

160
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,686
For yesterday.

161
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:15,366
Sophie?

162
00:27:16,486 --> 00:27:21,206
I kept wondering what I'd done wrong.
-You didn't do anything wrong.

163
00:27:25,406 --> 00:27:27,006
Coffee?

164
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:30,126
No. Hot wine punch disguised as coffee.

165
00:27:33,206 --> 00:27:34,606
So...

166
00:27:35,406 --> 00:27:38,366
did you black out
before or after you kicked me?

167
00:27:43,606 --> 00:27:46,406
We were kissing,
you kicked me and then ran off.

168
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,446
Have you slept much since the accident?

169
00:27:55,686 --> 00:27:57,126
Not much.

170
00:27:57,846 --> 00:28:00,246
Get yourself checked over tomorrow, okay?

171
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,646
Of course.

172
00:28:04,206 --> 00:28:07,646
I'm pretty normal otherwise. Honest.

173
00:28:08,926 --> 00:28:10,486
Okay.

174
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:14,726
You're playing it cool
because you're through with me?

175
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:22,286
I got into big trouble at the hospital
for taking you to the morgue.

176
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:27,766
But...

177
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:31,526
Everyone reacts differently
to losing someone.

178
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:42,166
Take that and you'll sleep like a log.

179
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:46,406
Sleep works wonders.

180
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,206
Thanks.

181
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:54,126
I'd be more relaxed
if you didn't hit me when I kiss you.

182
00:28:57,246 --> 00:28:58,686
Well...

183
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:08,486
We couldn't get hold of you, Ms Tauber.
-I'm sorry. My phone was...

184
00:29:10,406 --> 00:29:11,846
... playing up.

185
00:29:12,526 --> 00:29:15,766
But I take it you'll be
at the rehearsal tomorrow?

186
00:29:16,286 --> 00:29:18,286
Yes. Absolutely.

187
00:29:18,326 --> 00:29:21,566
Okay. Tomorrow at 9,
as keen and alert as ever.

188
00:29:24,926 --> 00:29:27,846
Ms Tauber?
-Okay, see you tomorrow.

GPS TRACKER

190
00:31:23,123 --> 00:31:24,083
I'm sorry.

191
00:31:44,643 --> 00:31:45,723
Hey, Sophie.

192
00:31:46,882 --> 00:31:49,482
I already know where one of them works.

193
00:32:24,963 --> 00:32:28,403
Leave her alone!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

194
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:57,961
What does she want?
-She wants chloroform.

195
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:01,922
I want it today.
-Today?

196
00:33:33,092 --> 00:33:34,372
Morning.

197
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:37,012
Come here, please.

198
00:33:39,732 --> 00:33:43,812
Take it easy. Come on out here.
No, not there. Over here.

199
00:33:43,944 --> 00:33:48,104
Okay... Now tell me
why you were at the kindergarten.

200
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:52,184
Did you want to break in?
Into a kindergarten?

201
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:56,264
A kindergarten? Seriously?
Or did you think you lived there?

202
00:33:56,304 --> 00:33:58,784
No surprise.
You were totally drunk.

203
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:02,464
Sorry?
I don't understand you. What?

204
00:34:03,383 --> 00:34:04,704
What?

205
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:08,423
Oh, no. Let me see that.
Now take it easy...

206
00:34:09,984 --> 00:34:11,504
Wake up.

207
00:34:12,506 --> 00:34:13,466
Hello?

208
00:34:15,506 --> 00:34:16,866
Hello?

209
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:20,107
Are you okay?

210
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:23,226
I found your spray.
You have asthma, right?

211
00:34:23,546 --> 00:34:25,027
Just calm down.

212
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:28,747
Now, slowly breathe in.

213
00:34:28,786 --> 00:34:31,026
Slowly breathe out.

214
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:34,306
Take it nice and easy.
Everything's fine.

215
00:34:34,627 --> 00:34:37,626
Your airways are clear.
You can breathe just fine.

216
00:34:39,866 --> 00:34:41,747
The human body is very simple:

217
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:45,386
Everyone has their limits.
Fear, stress, repressing things.

218
00:34:45,426 --> 00:34:48,426
The body makes it clear
when you reach your limits.

219
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:52,946
What you have right now
isn't caused by asthma.

220
00:34:54,186 --> 00:34:56,307
Are you done with her?

221
00:34:57,866 --> 00:34:59,587
I can't force you,

222
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:03,266
but I'd suggest
we check you over at the hospital.

223
00:35:03,307 --> 00:35:06,587
We have a psychiatric ward.
I'd like to do a few tests and... Ms...

224
00:35:17,147 --> 00:35:19,666
RECONSTRUCT ROUTE

ST. MARTINUS KINDERGARTEN

226
00:35:46,586 --> 00:35:48,106
Stop right there.

227
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:50,826
Just stop right there.

228
00:35:52,346 --> 00:35:54,467
I just wanted to say sorry.

229
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:59,107
This is where I came as a child.
-Okay, you've said it. Now leave.

230
00:36:02,306 --> 00:36:06,787
Could you help me out a bit?
I can't remember what I was doing here.

231
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:11,187
What you were doing here?
You attacked a policeman.

232
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:15,791
You were shouting like mad.
You didn't know what you were doing.

233
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:18,831
I...

234
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:25,831
Now listen: if you come here again,
drunk or sober, I'll press charges.

235
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:28,631
It won't happen again.

236
00:36:29,631 --> 00:36:31,070
Take this back.

237
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:36,550
You went crazy when you lost this.

238
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:39,071
Thank you.

239
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:42,791
I'm sorry.

240
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,111
You have one message.

241
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:57,618
First message.

242
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:03,098
What can I say, Ms Tauber?
This is my third call. You're not here.

243
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:07,321
I'm sorry, but we'll have to
go with another candidate.

244
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:26,329
Yes?

245
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:29,489
Elly.

246
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:41,326
Hey, Sophie...

247
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:11,728
I know where one of them works already.

248
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,259
I'll find out where the other one lives.

249
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:21,369
I know...

250
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:25,329
I can't make everything okay again.

251
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:29,089
I... can't bring our parents...

252
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:32,529
back to life.

253
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:37,969
But I can make sure you're safe.

254
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,968
I'll make sure you're safe,
once and for all.

255
00:40:45,448 --> 00:40:48,369
And no one will ever guess
it was us who did it.

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,079
Hello.
-Hey.

261
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,080
Okay... so tell me what's up.

262
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,720
Why...

263
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,720
Who's the reason
for the sleeping tablets?

264
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,280
My brother.

265
00:42:40,147 --> 00:42:42,867
He drowned. He was drunk.

266
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:47,719
I'm sorry.
-No, it's a while ago now.

267
00:42:57,279 --> 00:43:00,520
So, how do you manage...

268
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,919
Because you said it takes a while...

269
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:10,160
to accept what happened.

270
00:43:12,935 --> 00:43:15,215
How...
-Okay.

271
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,400
How close were you two?

272
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:20,140
Too close.

273
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,821
Which means?

274
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:30,221
My sister was really ill. Paranoid.

275
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,020
She thought every stranger was a danger
and was always worried I'd get hurt.

276
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,100
When we were in your car...

277
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:43,700
I was happy she's dead.

278
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,180
For the first time ever,
my life is about me.

279
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,780
And it feels good.

280
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,580
But...

281
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,100
But somehow she won't let me.

282
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,020
My brother wanted me to pick him up.

283
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,861
He always said life was one big party.

284
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:21,700
I always picked him up.
Every time, wherever he was.

285
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,420
That one time, I didn't.

286
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,060
I phoned him on his mobile and said,

287
00:44:31,661 --> 00:44:34,460
"Find your own way home. Screw you."

288
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:43,218
The word "mourning" always sounds
so selfless, but it's totally selfish.

289
00:44:43,259 --> 00:44:47,058
Basically, you're just trying to carry on
without feeling guilty.

290
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:51,899
And it works.

291
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:56,253
It gets easier from month to month.

292
00:45:23,573 --> 00:45:26,133
I thought we could pretend
it's your birthday.

293
00:45:26,453 --> 00:45:30,773
It was funny. I'll be back in a sec.
-But the idea was pretty...

294
00:45:43,693 --> 00:45:45,053
Hey!

295
00:45:46,652 --> 00:45:48,653
The toilets are back there.

296
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,493
Has something happened?

297
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:21,092
How many times have you
been out together?

298
00:46:23,853 --> 00:46:26,852
I don't want you to see her anymore.
-Who?

299
00:46:27,173 --> 00:46:30,412
Stop calling her.
Don't contact her anymore.

300
00:46:30,733 --> 00:46:34,013
Take it easy.
-She doesn't give a shit about you.

301
00:46:35,813 --> 00:46:37,333
Hang on, Sophie...

302
00:46:45,733 --> 00:46:49,973
If you contact her ever again,
I'll kill you.

303
00:46:51,652 --> 00:46:53,373
Understood?

304
00:46:53,413 --> 00:46:54,973
Understood?

305
00:47:18,373 --> 00:47:22,733
Where's the fucking money?
What are you doing, Sophie?

306
00:48:11,133 --> 00:48:14,693
I like you.
And I'd never find anyone else...

307
00:48:14,733 --> 00:48:18,173
Stop pissing me off.
Stop pissing me off, will you?

308
00:48:19,653 --> 00:48:21,092
Shut it!

309
00:48:25,973 --> 00:48:27,053
Here. Where's the money?

310
00:50:21,342 --> 00:50:23,461
Hello? Hello!

311
00:50:24,879 --> 00:50:26,679
What do you want?

312
00:50:29,231 --> 00:50:30,831
What are you going to do to me?

313
00:50:30,871 --> 00:50:32,111
Hello?

314
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,670
What do you want?

315
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:41,551
I'm just out for a walk.

316
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,471
Where's the driver?

317
00:50:48,791 --> 00:50:50,631
I don't know. He's gone.

318
00:50:51,031 --> 00:50:53,150
I just saw the accident.

319
00:50:54,991 --> 00:50:56,271
Please, help me.

320
00:50:56,671 --> 00:50:58,711
They locked me in here.

321
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:03,671
It's locked.
-Please, go and get the police.

322
00:51:08,591 --> 00:51:11,511
What should I tell them?
-I've been tied up.

323
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:13,911
But I got the gag off my mouth.

324
00:51:18,168 --> 00:51:19,728
And who did it?

325
00:51:20,968 --> 00:51:24,888
I don't know. He came from behind
and drugged me or something.

326
00:51:27,448 --> 00:51:29,408
And then I woke up in here.

327
00:51:32,928 --> 00:51:34,089
Hello?

328
00:51:39,169 --> 00:51:40,409
Hello?

329
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:57,248
Help! Help!

330
00:51:57,969 --> 00:51:59,968
Help! Help!

331
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,324
Don't move.

332
00:53:17,932 --> 00:53:19,652
Maria Uchwat?

333
00:53:23,732 --> 00:53:26,973
You sent me that letter.

334
00:53:29,972 --> 00:53:34,212
I was locked up for 20 years
because that arsehole went berserk.

335
00:53:37,892 --> 00:53:39,372
Please...

336
00:53:42,951 --> 00:53:44,471
Why us?

337
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:48,631
You were rich.

338
00:53:49,431 --> 00:53:51,711
And didn't have any neighbours.

339
00:53:53,471 --> 00:53:55,911
We wanted to get in quick.

340
00:53:57,191 --> 00:54:01,031
Grab some expensive stuff.
We'd done it loads of times.

341
00:54:03,151 --> 00:54:05,271
It's completely harmless.

342
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:08,951
But this time the father was home too.

343
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:11,631
We thought he wasn't there.

344
00:54:14,711 --> 00:54:16,911
He went for us.

345
00:54:18,551 --> 00:54:20,151
My mate...

346
00:54:21,711 --> 00:54:23,231
He...

347
00:54:24,151 --> 00:54:26,471
He beat him to death.

348
00:54:32,271 --> 00:54:34,071
And the mother?

349
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:40,231
She'd... seen his face.

350
00:54:40,671 --> 00:54:42,431
I didn't want that.

351
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,751
I didn't want that.

352
00:54:54,951 --> 00:54:58,631
Did you do anything to the children?
-No.

353
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:02,951
To the dark-haired one?
-No, we didn't even see them.

354
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:08,511
The other one...

355
00:55:09,271 --> 00:55:11,551
Does he have a child?

356
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:15,911
Well...

357
00:55:16,391 --> 00:55:21,551
We'd had day release for a few years.
So it's possible.

358
00:55:32,752 --> 00:55:34,751
You're going to leave town.

359
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,832
Move somewhere far away. Got it?

360
00:55:37,871 --> 00:55:39,111
Okay.

361
00:55:40,511 --> 00:55:43,391
If you go to the police...

362
00:55:43,431 --> 00:55:46,031
or set foot in this town again,
you're dead.

363
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:49,631
Okay, okay.
-Okay what?

364
00:55:49,671 --> 00:55:52,791
I'll never come back again.
I won't go to the police.

365
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:57,351
If you do, I'll kill you.

366
00:56:17,831 --> 00:56:19,511
I need all the files, though.

367
00:56:19,551 --> 00:56:23,351
I'll give you the new ones now.
The old ones are down in the archive.

368
00:56:23,391 --> 00:56:25,951
Can I take the files home?
-Yes, the copies.

369
00:56:43,792 --> 00:56:48,751
I don't want to get your hopes up.
Some files are away being digitised.

370
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:51,072
How long ago was it?
-Twenty years.

371
00:56:51,248 --> 00:56:52,608
Oh! Let's see.

372
00:57:02,008 --> 00:57:03,768
Looks like you're in luck.

373
00:57:05,528 --> 00:57:08,368
Sophie Tauber, five years old,
is alert and lucid

374
00:57:08,408 --> 00:57:11,208
and has no cognitive
or mnemic impairments.

375
00:57:11,248 --> 00:57:15,328
She has processed the incident
far better than her older sister.

376
00:57:15,368 --> 00:57:19,048
As they hid,
Jessica covered Sophie's eyes and ears,

377
00:57:19,368 --> 00:57:22,248
so Sophie wouldn't see
their parents being killed.

378
00:57:22,568 --> 00:57:26,768
Whenever we talk to Sophie, Jessica
stands in front of her protectively.

379
00:57:26,808 --> 00:57:29,288
Jessica shows signs of severe paranoia

380
00:57:29,328 --> 00:57:33,088
and is constantly worried
something will happen to Sophie.

381
00:57:33,128 --> 00:57:38,208
Weeks later we established that this fear
is accompanied by a deep sense of guilt.

382
00:57:38,248 --> 00:57:41,568
Jessica admitted
that a few days before the break-in

383
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:44,208
the perpetrators
had turned up at her kindergarten.

384
00:58:17,248 --> 00:58:18,849
What's that?

385
00:58:19,968 --> 00:58:21,729
What is that?
-Hey, Jessy!

386
00:58:22,048 --> 00:58:24,368
That's mine! I found it! Hey!

387
00:58:30,168 --> 00:58:31,609
Hey!

388
00:58:36,768 --> 00:58:37,968
How are you?

389
00:58:39,289 --> 00:58:40,808
What's your name?

390
00:58:43,048 --> 00:58:45,168
Have you eaten yet today?

391
00:58:47,008 --> 00:58:51,048
I heard they have my favourite food
at your kindergarten.

392
00:58:51,089 --> 00:58:52,368
Strawberries with sand.

393
00:58:53,448 --> 00:58:56,768
But nettles and sauce are even better.

394
00:58:58,008 --> 00:58:58,968
Yum!

395
00:58:59,288 --> 00:59:01,168
What did you have?

396
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:03,368
It's not even lunchtime yet.

397
00:59:03,408 --> 00:59:05,368
Oh, you're right!

398
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:08,288
Do you eat here at the kindergarten?

399
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:14,129
I always eat with my mummy.

400
00:59:14,608 --> 00:59:18,968
What do your parents do?
-My mummy plays the piano.

401
00:59:19,008 --> 00:59:20,648
And my daddy's a dentist.

402
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:22,968
A dentist. Oh...

403
00:59:24,248 --> 00:59:26,768
I have to go to the dentist soon.

404
00:59:26,808 --> 00:59:29,089
Does your daddy work all week?

405
00:59:29,568 --> 00:59:31,768
No, he's off on Wednesdays.

406
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:34,088
Where do you live then?

407
00:59:34,528 --> 00:59:36,648
Ahornstrasse 8.

408
00:59:36,968 --> 00:59:41,328
But my daddy works at Schwanleite 6.

409
00:59:42,435 --> 00:59:44,635
Yes, I know that street.

410
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:48,276
I've got to go. Bye.

411
01:00:04,224 --> 01:00:06,144
All therapeutic measures

412
01:00:06,184 --> 01:00:08,811
to ease Jessica's sense of guilt
about the death of her parents

413
01:00:08,836 --> 01:00:10,877
have failed to date.

414
01:00:46,104 --> 01:00:47,624
Come on!

415
01:00:47,664 --> 01:00:49,144
Drive!

416
01:01:07,704 --> 01:01:09,624
Just leave me...

417
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:35,759
Fuck!

418
01:01:58,462 --> 01:02:00,182
Maria Uchwat?

419
01:02:01,303 --> 01:02:03,383
Is she here?
-What?

420
01:02:03,742 --> 01:02:05,182
Maria Uchwat?

421
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,662
Doesn't work here anymore.

422
01:02:07,702 --> 01:02:10,503
Where did she go?
-How should I know?

423
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:00,462
Zip up your jacket
or you'll catch cold.

424
01:03:16,942 --> 01:03:20,863
When we get home, you're off to bed.
-Why? -It's half past eight.

425
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:22,982
That's early!

426
01:03:23,022 --> 01:03:25,462
Why do I always
have to go to bed so early?

427
01:03:26,822 --> 01:03:28,543
Hang on a minute.

428
01:05:43,035 --> 01:05:44,755
She's over there!

429
01:07:02,063 --> 01:07:04,863
I know what you want.
You want a nice, normal life.

430
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:06,742
You want to forget. And you should.

431
01:07:06,783 --> 01:07:11,183
I want you to have a nice life,
but you have to be safe first.

432
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:16,383
I messed up. He recognised me.

433
01:07:16,422 --> 01:07:18,742
But he won't get away next time.

434
01:09:05,263 --> 01:09:07,543
Leave me alone! This is my life!

435
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:09,503
Just leave me alone!

436
01:09:34,756 --> 01:09:36,476
What do you want?

437
01:09:36,956 --> 01:09:38,756
I need your help.

438
01:09:38,795 --> 01:09:41,115
You need help.
But this is too screwed up for me.

439
01:09:41,436 --> 01:09:42,475
Wait!

440
01:10:06,116 --> 01:10:10,436
You don't exist. You're dead.

441
01:10:31,476 --> 01:10:33,396
Have you slept at all?

442
01:10:35,636 --> 01:10:39,356
Since I gave you the pills...
Have you slept at all?

443
01:10:48,236 --> 01:10:51,475
She's leaving messages
on my answering machine.

444
01:10:51,755 --> 01:10:53,196
She knows...

445
01:10:53,306 --> 01:10:55,626
stuff that only Jessy and I know.

446
01:10:57,235 --> 01:11:00,076
I'm taking you to hospital now.
-No, I don't need to go there.

447
01:11:00,576 --> 01:11:04,696
You want help, right? I'll get you some.
-I can cope with that on my own.

448
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:08,656
I just have to know
how to get rid of her.

449
01:11:10,416 --> 01:11:12,496
Get rid of her?
-She's still inside me.

450
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:17,215
I have to...
-You have to sleep.

451
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,896
I just want her gone.

452
01:11:21,816 --> 01:11:24,215
Since I've known you,
you've been repressing her death.

453
01:11:25,575 --> 01:11:29,376
Jessy's dead. I'm not repressing it.
-Give me your car keys. I'll drive.

454
01:11:29,936 --> 01:11:31,976
I can cope, Martin!
-You can't cope!

455
01:11:34,215 --> 01:11:35,936
You can't cope!

456
01:11:37,016 --> 01:11:38,976
Did you hear what you just said?

457
01:11:40,535 --> 01:11:42,455
Do you realise what you said?

458
01:11:46,096 --> 01:11:48,016
Do you realise?

459
01:12:20,693 --> 01:12:22,093
Okay...

460
01:12:23,654 --> 01:12:27,494
Wait here. I'll get one of my colleagues.
-You'll tell them...

461
01:12:27,534 --> 01:12:29,373
Sure. Don't worry.

462
01:12:31,614 --> 01:12:33,014
If...

463
01:12:37,185 --> 01:12:40,106
If I was normal,
we might have had a chance, huh?

464
01:12:43,345 --> 01:12:45,425
First you have to get better, okay?

465
01:12:48,505 --> 01:12:50,985
You don't need to lie to me.

466
01:12:53,505 --> 01:12:57,865
Who's crazier? The crazy girl
or the guy who's fallen for her?

467
01:13:00,266 --> 01:13:02,586
I can't be normal myself
or I'd have dumped you already.

468
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:04,666
If only for your crazy tattoo.

469
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:32,545
Why are you chained up?

470
01:15:36,226 --> 01:15:39,545
I'll take the gag off
and then you can tell me why.

471
01:15:50,586 --> 01:15:52,266
Help!

472
01:15:53,906 --> 01:15:55,666
Help!

473
01:16:54,345 --> 01:16:55,825
Come on. Finish up.

474
01:17:24,553 --> 01:17:26,832
Help! Help!

475
01:17:37,632 --> 01:17:39,832
Sophie? Sophie?

476
01:21:58,302 --> 01:22:02,502
Leave me alone! This is my life!
Just leave me alone!

477
01:22:27,435 --> 01:22:29,075
Are you still there?

478
01:22:39,943 --> 01:22:43,822
My deepest sympathies on the death
of your sister, Sophie Tauber,

479
01:22:44,303 --> 01:22:49,823
born in February 1990 and
deceased on October 13th this year.

480
01:22:50,463 --> 01:22:53,463
We will now lay her to rest.

481
01:23:27,154 --> 01:23:29,634
It didn't take you long to...

482
01:23:30,434 --> 01:23:31,994
True.

483
01:23:34,274 --> 01:23:37,474
It's only been around two months.
-True.

484
01:23:42,394 --> 01:23:44,274
What will you do next?

485
01:23:45,834 --> 01:23:47,395
We'll see.

486
01:23:50,314 --> 01:23:52,034
Are you auditioning again?

487
01:23:53,435 --> 01:23:54,754
On piano?

488
01:23:58,795 --> 01:24:00,794
Know what my adventure was today?

489
01:24:09,314 --> 01:24:11,474
I don't know what you want from me.

490
01:24:15,795 --> 01:24:20,914
Listen up: I'm not the hospital.
I don't know what's crazy or normal.

491
01:24:22,034 --> 01:24:24,514
Or which one of you
I'm talking to right now.

492
01:24:24,555 --> 01:24:27,474
But I'd be happy
if you'd call me sometime.

493
01:24:40,635 --> 01:24:44,035
One, two, three, four...

494
01:30:18,795 --> 01:30:22,035
