1
00:02:56,201 --> 00:03:00,355
<i>...the accountants who look after Ireland
don't see forest like that at all.</i>

2
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:04,318
<i>And subsequently Greece isn't the only
member of the Poor Eurozone club</i>

3
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,796
<i>to consider selling off bits of
its environment to make some money.</i>

4
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,924
<i>But this would leave Ireland
as the only country in the developed world</i>

5
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,260
<i>without a publicly-owned forest.</i>

6
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:15,929
<i>And it isn't even as though
it's going to get rich out of it.</i>

7
00:03:16,054 --> 00:03:20,976
<i>Hence the backlash we experienced today
at the Free Our Trees rally.</i>

8
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:25,230
<i>Those parasites can show up and try
but I'll tell you one thing for sure</i>

9
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:29,234
<i>over our dead bodies
will they take our trees from us!</i>

10
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:35,849
Yeah.

11
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,328
There's enough trees to keep Daddy
busy until you're all grown up.

12
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:44,082
I know.

13
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:46,209
I like it, too.

14
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:20,911
A lot of them are gonna have
to come down, Finn.

15
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:22,980
Yeah.

16
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,040
It's sad.

17
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,425
Alright. Let's get you back to Mom.

18
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:38,804
Iggy!

19
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:06,081
Iggy!

20
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,069
Hey, come on, Finnball.

21
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:13,338
Let's go and find Iggy.

22
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,591
Iggy!

23
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,771
Iggy!

24
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,733
Iggy!

25
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:35,736
Yeah.

26
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:46,538
What do you think of that, Finn?

27
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:56,256
Hey.

28
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,404
What's going on?

29
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:02,364
Don't tell Mom.

30
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,424
Shit!

31
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:17,856
I'm sorry, Mr. Donnelly. He's not here.

32
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,696
You can come in and wait if you like.

33
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,408
He's in the forest again, is he?

34
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,586
- He's trespassing.
- It's his job, Mr. Donnelly.

35
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:43,256
It's dangerous for him...
and the little one.

36
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:53,642
I'm sorry. I'll make sure my husband
stops by your farm first thing tomorrow.

37
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,310
Tonight.

38
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,021
He comes to see me tonight.

39
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

40
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,496
- Christ! When did you get home?
- Just got in. Can you take Finn?

41
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:35,292
- Colm is out there. Go talk to him.
- No, not today.

42
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:38,879
Why? Adam, please just go,
buy him a pint and hear him out.

43
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,797
Tried that. Still not mates.

44
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:44,109
That's the third time since we moved here.
He's creeping me out.

45
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:45,902
Look, they're just words.

46
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:49,614
He's just not happy they're selling
the forest, neither am I.

47
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,993
But I have work to do
and he's gonna have to deal with it.

48
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:57,122
- I can't not do my job, now, can I?
- Please, just talk to him.

49
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,210
Okay.

50
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,482
What did you find, Iggs?

51
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:34,993
Come on, darling. Come on. Hey.

52
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,457
Adam?

53
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,002
Adam! The roof's falling in.

54
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,837
Literally?

55
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:12,382
Yes, Adam. Five hundred years
of ancient Irish sludge

56
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:14,843
are dripping all over Finn's bed.

57
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:19,164
I'll move the cot.

58
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:21,641
Can you check the attic, please?

59
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,210
Didn't find anything.

60
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:33,005
Everything's okay.

61
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,300
Probably just damp. It's an old place.

62
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:41,638
- Are you missing London?
- Oh, God, no.

63
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,100
Me neither.

64
00:13:47,978 --> 00:13:50,897
Wine. Wine.

65
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:54,067
It's like camping.

66
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:11,335
Have I ever shown you a cordycep?

67
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,003
Probably.

68
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:16,365
You show me lots of weird shit
when you smoke weed.

69
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:20,177
It's the Trojan Horse of parasitic fungi.

70
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:23,055
Come see this.

71
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:26,391
This little beauty.

72
00:14:26,516 --> 00:14:30,395
Its spores can penetrate
the skull of an ant...

73
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,814
take control of its mind.

74
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:35,776
That's disgusting.

75
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:37,844
It's amazing.

76
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:42,574
It gets inside the nest, drops its spores
over the entire colony...

77
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,186
creating thousands of little...

78
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,121
fungus...

79
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,959
controlled automatons.

80
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:55,379
You're so high.

81
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,007
Not when I found it.

82
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:04,204
I wasn't.

83
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:08,709
- I was with Finn.
- Fine, fine, Doctor Attenborough.

84
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,645
Just don't go bringing
any of those in here.

85
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:16,483
Of course you did.

86
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:30,414
Those ants really do it
for you, don't they?

87
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,461
- I need to drain the pasta.
- I know.

88
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:41,842
Is that why you're stepping on my foot?

89
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:08,410
I do. I really... I really need
to get the pasta now. I do.

90
00:16:36,938 --> 00:16:40,275
Don't creepy-eye me, Ant Man.

91
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:43,303
I remember you back in school.

92
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:47,115
Poor girls. Bring the pot, please?

93
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:56,249
Just baby dreams.

94
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,109
Okay.

95
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,821
Colm.

96
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:29,491
- It's okay. It's okay.
- It's Colm.

97
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:34,871
Honey, it's okay. It's o...

98
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,768
Yeah, police.

99
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:04,776
Well, your window's definitely broke

100
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:06,778
but your frame looks intact.

101
00:18:06,903 --> 00:18:09,306
I understand stuff like this
can get quite unnerving

102
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:11,975
especially when it happens
in the middle of the night.

103
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:14,311
But I wouldn't worry about it too much
it's probably just some bird

104
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:16,330
that's dipped his beak in too many pints.

105
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,415
How does a bird throw a lamp?

106
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:20,625
Well...

107
00:18:22,044 --> 00:18:24,613
see a shiny object through the window

108
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:26,865
flies in, gets injured,
flies around the room

109
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:29,760
knocks over a lamp. Happens all the time.

110
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:31,745
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

111
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:35,807
Mr. Hitchens, this isn't London.
Things here go bump in the night.

112
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:39,478
Look, we've not been well received here.

113
00:18:39,603 --> 00:18:41,046
- Our neighbor...
- Colm?

114
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:43,257
- Colm, yes.
- Not without cause.

115
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:45,425
You're aware?

116
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,695
Everybody is. You're making people
nervous when you're out there.

117
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,406
- It's my job.
- I know, Mr. Hitchens.

118
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:55,202
- But these people have got certain beliefs.
- Beliefs?

119
00:18:55,494 --> 00:19:00,916
They believe that the forest that you're
trampling on belongs to the Hallow.

120
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,569
- The Hallow?
- The good people.

121
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:08,590
Fairies, banshees, baby stealers.

122
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:12,452
You're not afraid with your Irish folklore,
are you, Mr. Hitchens?

123
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:16,206
A conquered people, forever in hiding

124
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:20,894
driven from their sacred lands
by man with iron and fire.

125
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:23,897
Beautifully told.

126
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:26,108
So you're a believer?

127
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:30,570
No, not me. I'm from Belfast.

128
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:33,407
Different sort of boogeyman up there.

129
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:38,996
But we're dealing with a very
superstitious people around here.

130
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:41,398
Especially Mr. Donnelly.

131
00:19:41,498 --> 00:19:43,792
You see, his beautiful wee daughter Cora

132
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,461
she wandered into the woods one day.

133
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:49,381
She never came back.

134
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:53,051
And he would have you believe
that they took her.

135
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:19,353
I'm sorry.

136
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,496
Should have just...

137
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,207
gone and talked to Colm.

138
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,003
- Do you really think...
- Or what?

139
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:30,714
A drunken bird?

140
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:33,759
Or a...

141
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:37,387
A Hallow?

142
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:44,478
He's just trying to scare us, that's all.

143
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:53,820
You should sleep.

144
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:56,448
I'll be right back.

145
00:20:57,532 --> 00:21:01,328
- Where are you going?
- Just gonna take some pictures.

146
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:03,789
For evidence.

147
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

148
00:22:14,818 --> 00:22:16,403
Iggs?

149
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,781
Iggy?

150
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:22,868
Come here, Iggs.

151
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:45,932
What's wrong, Iggs?

152
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:36,626
Adam, love.

153
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:42,507
- It's noon.
- Shit.

154
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:46,553
Fell asleep.

155
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,669
I'm gonna get the window mended.

156
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:55,354
And Colm?

157
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:59,608
Yeah. I'll see him tonight. Promise.

158
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:27,547
Gotta get out there, here you go.

159
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:46,358
We had an incident.

160
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:51,029
Police seem to think a pissed off
bird mistook my house for his.

161
00:27:51,655 --> 00:27:55,325
- You're the tree doctor?
- Not exactly, but, yeah.

162
00:27:57,953 --> 00:28:00,455
If you trespass upon them...

163
00:28:00,956 --> 00:28:03,609
- they'll trespass upon you.
- Is that right?

164
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:05,277
Look, I'll fix this

165
00:28:05,377 --> 00:28:09,256
but if your wife doesn't put the iron
back up there's really no point.

166
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,376
You don't listen.

167
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:53,383
You think I'm crazy?

168
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:05,771
Please. Plea...

169
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:05,664
Come on, Finn. We're almost home.

170
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Here we go.

171
00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:06,767
Finn. Come on, buddy. It's okay.

172
00:31:08,018 --> 00:31:09,728
Fuck.

173
00:31:20,822 --> 00:31:23,075
Back in a minute.

174
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

175
00:33:12,351 --> 00:33:14,227
Finn? Finn!

176
00:33:30,994 --> 00:33:32,788
Finn?

177
00:33:50,847 --> 00:33:53,058
It's alright, Finn.

178
00:34:00,315 --> 00:34:02,025
Hey.

179
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:05,070
Come on. Come on.

180
00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:09,366
It's alright.

181
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:19,543
Oh, my...

182
00:34:41,898 --> 00:34:43,467
Come on.

183
00:34:43,567 --> 00:34:45,527
Good boy.

184
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:11,345
- Claire?
- In here.

185
00:35:11,637 --> 00:35:14,556
- Where have you been?
- I was hoofin'.

186
00:35:14,681 --> 00:35:18,544
- You okay?
- I tried to call you. Colm was here.

187
00:35:18,644 --> 00:35:20,562
In the house?

188
00:35:20,687 --> 00:35:23,674
Take Finn upstairs. Call the police.

189
00:35:23,774 --> 00:35:26,026
Adam, what's going on?

190
00:35:27,152 --> 00:35:30,072
- Answer me.
- Just call the police.

191
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,120
Adam?

192
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:42,084
Do you know how to use that?

193
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:45,087
- Doesn't matter.
- No, it's not right.

194
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,339
It's just in case.

195
00:35:47,464 --> 00:35:49,841
Until the police arrive.

196
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:45,731
Stay here. Lock the door.

197
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:57,242
It's okay. It's okay.

198
00:37:16,345 --> 00:37:18,639
The police are coming!

199
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,120
Colm.

200
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
whatever happened to your daughter...
has nothing to do with us.

201
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

202
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,382
Adam?

203
00:38:47,144 --> 00:38:48,562
Adam?

204
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,930
Adam, are you okay?

205
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,700
No. No, I'm not okay.

206
00:39:03,452 --> 00:39:06,163
He came into our house.

207
00:39:06,997 --> 00:39:08,790
He came into our home.

208
00:39:24,556 --> 00:39:27,059
Stop! Adam, stop!

209
00:39:27,517 --> 00:39:29,478
Don't lose your head.

210
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:33,649
Hey, hey, hey...

211
00:39:47,537 --> 00:39:49,314
This...

212
00:39:49,414 --> 00:39:52,542
- this is not right.
- I know.

213
00:39:53,085 --> 00:39:57,506
- We just need to leave.
- We're not fucking leaving.

214
00:39:58,006 --> 00:40:02,260
We've been here a month.
We haven't bothered anyone.

215
00:40:02,386 --> 00:40:04,471
I'm not being intimidated by that man!

216
00:40:04,596 --> 00:40:08,141
Adam, just calm down.

217
00:40:20,404 --> 00:40:22,447
What's this?

218
00:40:22,864 --> 00:40:25,242
Colm brought it over.

219
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:50,684
It's a book of fucking fairy tales.

220
00:40:50,809 --> 00:40:53,253
We need to leave now.

221
00:40:53,353 --> 00:40:55,063
Okay.

222
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,400
Get Finn's bag.

223
00:40:59,526 --> 00:41:01,278
I'm sorry, Claire.

224
00:41:13,123 --> 00:41:14,875
Iggy!

225
00:41:20,505 --> 00:41:22,282
Iggy!

226
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:23,967
Stay here, Claire.

227
00:41:42,694 --> 00:41:44,446
Iggs.

228
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:47,908
Iggs.

229
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,627
Iggy.

230
00:42:10,806 --> 00:42:14,726
Jesus, Iggs. What did they do to you?

231
00:42:15,185 --> 00:42:17,437
Come on. Let's go.

232
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:34,788
Iggs.

233
00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:38,417
Iggy.

234
00:42:46,842 --> 00:42:49,928
- Iggy! Come back here.
- Iggy!

235
00:42:59,646 --> 00:43:03,258
- Bastard! Bastards.
- Come on. Adam, come on.

236
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:05,235
Cowards.

237
00:43:19,499 --> 00:43:21,752
Claire, take the bag.

238
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:32,220
- You ready?
- No, wait.

239
00:43:33,221 --> 00:43:35,015
Come on.

240
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,017
Okay, now.

241
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:46,777
It's not.

242
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,574
Okay, hit it again.

243
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:02,668
- Adam.
- Wait!

244
00:44:02,793 --> 00:44:04,528
Quick, Adam! There's something back there!

245
00:44:04,628 --> 00:44:06,296
Go, now.

246
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:15,389
Well, come on, Adam! Come on!

247
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:23,981
Get in, get in, get in.

248
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Get in, get in, get in!
Get in!
Sorry!

249
00:44:35,575 --> 00:44:38,704
Adam, get in! Get in, get in, get in!

250
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:41,206
Go!

251
00:44:44,418 --> 00:44:47,587
- Get to the road, Claire!
- I am, I am!

252
00:44:53,385 --> 00:44:55,178
Let's go!

253
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:01,727
Is he okay? Is he okay?

254
00:45:30,464 --> 00:45:33,842
Claire, you alright? Finn.

255
00:45:35,218 --> 00:45:36,637
Finn.

256
00:45:44,186 --> 00:45:45,771
Careful.

257
00:45:47,898 --> 00:45:50,442
- It's okay. He's okay.
- Finn?

258
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:52,444
He's okay!

259
00:45:57,157 --> 00:45:59,993
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

260
00:46:15,258 --> 00:46:17,052
Claire.

261
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:19,246
- Please listen, okay?
- What?

262
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:21,748
- Claire.
- Adam, what?

263
00:46:21,848 --> 00:46:24,559
- It's... it's...
- Stop. Stop. Don't try.

264
00:46:24,851 --> 00:46:27,938
We saw the same thing. The Hallow.

265
00:46:28,563 --> 00:46:30,482
It's real.

266
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000

267
00:46:54,798 --> 00:46:57,367
God! Goddamn it!

- Show me, show me, show me.
- Something in my eye.

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

270
00:47:37,466 --> 00:47:39,509
Get the other torch!

271
00:47:40,677 --> 00:47:44,164
Upstairs. Go quickly. Upstairs.

272
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:45,682
Now!

273
00:47:51,563 --> 00:47:53,815
Watch out, Claire.

274
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:59,154
Go up there.

275
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,991
Take this. Hide up there, Claire.

276
00:48:03,408 --> 00:48:06,603
- Why?
- If the light hurt it, I gotta go back out.

277
00:48:06,703 --> 00:48:09,081
I've gotta start the generator.

278
00:48:09,206 --> 00:48:11,124
Go up there now.

279
00:50:16,124 --> 00:50:17,876
Honey, it's okay.

280
00:50:38,772 --> 00:50:41,817
Adam? Adam?

281
00:50:42,484 --> 00:50:44,945
- Claire?
- Adam.

282
00:50:50,826 --> 00:50:52,619
Claire?

283
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's okay, Finnball.

284
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,810
It's okay.

285
00:54:04,144 --> 00:54:05,687
Adam?

286
00:54:34,383 --> 00:54:37,010
No, no!

287
00:54:58,448 --> 00:55:00,575
Bastards.

288
00:55:22,306 --> 00:55:25,976
- Are you okay?
- I'm alright. Fine.

289
00:55:34,443 --> 00:55:36,361
It's okay.

290
00:55:37,487 --> 00:55:39,906
I'm gonna need your help with these.

291
00:55:48,248 --> 00:55:50,250
Light and iron.

292
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:52,711
That's what the policeman said.

293
00:55:54,212 --> 00:55:56,965
Claire, can you put it across the middle?

294
00:55:57,466 --> 00:56:00,177
Hold it there. Okay.

295
00:56:04,014 --> 00:56:07,351
- Hang these up.
- How do you know this is going to work?

296
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:08,894
I'm certain.

297
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

298
00:57:00,696 --> 00:57:02,489
- Alright?
- What are you doing?

299
00:57:02,614 --> 00:57:04,866
It's not safe for him.

300
00:57:08,161 --> 00:57:10,522
- You... you can't put him in there.
- Where else?

301
00:57:10,622 --> 00:57:12,482
With us.

302
00:57:12,582 --> 00:57:14,376
Claire...

303
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:16,695
the generator's gonna die.

304
00:57:16,795 --> 00:57:20,215
When it does, he's safer
in here than he is with us.

305
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:22,467
I promise.

306
00:57:22,759 --> 00:57:25,429
If he so much as whimpers,
we'll get him out.

307
00:57:25,554 --> 00:57:27,306
Okay?

308
00:57:38,817 --> 00:57:41,069
It's just till dawn.

309
00:57:42,195 --> 00:57:43,864
Listen.

310
00:57:45,866 --> 00:57:47,617
Listen.

311
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:51,021
See? It's fine.

312
00:57:51,121 --> 00:57:52,873
Alright.

313
00:58:48,971 --> 00:58:51,306
"Hallow be thy name.

314
00:58:51,598 --> 00:58:54,726
"Blessed be thy claim.

315
00:58:56,395 --> 00:59:00,757

Adam?

318
00:59:22,587 --> 00:59:24,423
"Changeling."

319
00:59:26,049 --> 00:59:27,467
Adam?

320
00:59:33,932 --> 00:59:36,418
- Checking on Finn.
- Don't. You'll wake him.

321
00:59:36,518 --> 00:59:38,895
I don't care. I want to see him.

322
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:40,647
You have the monitor.

323
00:59:40,772 --> 00:59:43,233
Just listen. He's fine.

324
00:59:47,821 --> 00:59:49,489
See?

325
00:59:49,614 --> 00:59:51,033
He's asleep.

326
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Heya, Finnball.

327
01:00:56,556 --> 01:00:58,266
Adam...

328
01:01:01,144 --> 01:01:04,147
No! No, no, no, no! Adam!

329
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:08,026
It's taken him.

330
01:01:08,443 --> 01:01:09,945
Finn!

331
01:01:11,863 --> 01:01:14,449
Please give him back!

332
01:01:15,158 --> 01:01:17,160
Please give him back!

333
01:01:20,747 --> 01:01:22,624
Finn!

334
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:25,194
- Finn!
- It's in the beam! It's in the beam!

335
01:01:25,294 --> 01:01:27,004
It's in the beam.

336
01:01:32,634 --> 01:01:34,136
No, no!

337
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,140
- You'll hit him! You'll hit him!
- It's gone up.

338
01:01:38,724 --> 01:01:41,310
Please find him. Please find him.

339
01:01:48,817 --> 01:01:51,111
There you are.

340
01:02:03,874 --> 01:02:05,584
Adam.

341
01:02:06,918 --> 01:02:10,505
Adam? Adam? Adam?

342
01:02:12,716 --> 01:02:14,384
Finn.

343
01:02:20,098 --> 01:02:23,310
Come on. Come on. Get up!

344
01:02:23,935 --> 01:02:25,937
Please get up!

345
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:29,733
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

346
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:46,810
Finn!

347
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:28,226
No!

348
01:05:51,018 --> 01:05:52,894
Give me.

349
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:02,029
He needs to be dried and changed.

350
01:06:09,786 --> 01:06:12,456
Quick, Adam, he's freezing.

351
01:06:14,082 --> 01:06:15,834
Here.

352
01:06:18,837 --> 01:06:20,631
Adam?

353
01:06:25,302 --> 01:06:28,847
- It's not Finn.
- What did you say?

354
01:06:36,229 --> 01:06:38,190
Look at him.

355
01:06:40,734 --> 01:06:41,818
Adam?

356
01:06:44,279 --> 01:06:46,490
It's a changeling.

357
01:06:46,615 --> 01:06:48,241
No.

358
01:06:51,244 --> 01:06:54,915
You need help. We need to get you help.

359
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:58,585
Give him to me.

360
01:07:04,257 --> 01:07:05,550
Give him to me.

361
01:07:05,676 --> 01:07:08,011
- It's a trick.
- No.

362
01:07:08,929 --> 01:07:10,931
Adam, look at yourself.

363
01:07:11,056 --> 01:07:13,558
They're in your head! Like the ants!

364
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:16,228
It's not Finn.

365
01:07:16,436 --> 01:07:17,312
- This is...
- Listen.

366
01:07:17,437 --> 01:07:19,314
- Give him to me.
- No!

367
01:07:19,439 --> 01:07:20,883
- No!
- Give him to me!

368
01:07:20,983 --> 01:07:22,843
Adam!

369
01:07:22,943 --> 01:07:25,904
Listen to me, they're in your head.

370
01:07:51,013 --> 01:07:54,416
Show yourself. Show yourself!

371
01:07:54,516 --> 01:07:56,768
Show yourself.

372
01:07:59,271 --> 01:08:00,981
Show yourself.

373
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

374
01:08:14,911 --> 01:08:17,205
Show yourself.

375
01:08:20,125 --> 01:08:21,918
Please, Adam.

376
01:08:32,638 --> 01:08:34,681
Where's my boy?

377
01:08:46,526 --> 01:08:48,320
Claire!

378
01:08:57,746 --> 01:08:59,857
- Claire, wait!
- No, no, no! Stay back!

379
01:08:59,957 --> 01:09:01,650
Wait, you don't know what you're doing!

380
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,752
- We have to find Finn!
- This is Finn!

381
01:09:03,877 --> 01:09:06,029
They tried to trick us!
They tried to trick us!

382
01:09:06,129 --> 01:09:09,116
- You're sick!
- It's not Finn!

383
01:09:09,216 --> 01:09:11,635
It's not Finn!

384
01:09:22,312 --> 01:09:25,357
- Claire!
- No!

385
01:09:30,904 --> 01:09:32,322
Claire!

386
01:09:36,535 --> 01:09:38,537
Claire!

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

388
01:10:26,752 --> 01:10:29,171
Give me the boy, Claire.

389
01:10:30,213 --> 01:10:32,549
He's not yours.

390
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:36,620
He's not yours at all, Claire.

391
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,765
- Can't you tell?
- Please, Adam, please.

392
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:41,833
You're wrong. You're sick.

393
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:47,481
No, Claire. No, Claire.
No, please, please. No, no, no.

394
01:10:48,315 --> 01:10:50,942
It's... it's not me.

395
01:10:51,318 --> 01:10:55,572
I'm not the one that...
that's going to hurt you.

396
01:10:56,740 --> 01:11:01,161
The boy... the boy... the boy is.

397
01:11:01,286 --> 01:11:03,372
The boy is.

398
01:11:04,498 --> 01:11:08,543
You really... think
they'd give him back to you?

399
01:11:10,045 --> 01:11:13,048
They want you.

400
01:11:15,258 --> 01:11:16,493
Give him to me.

401
01:11:16,593 --> 01:11:19,638
They want... Claire!

402
01:11:19,763 --> 01:11:21,974
- Please.
- They want all of us!

403
01:11:22,099 --> 01:11:24,267
All of us!

404
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,273
No!

405
01:11:38,824 --> 01:11:40,325
Get back!

406
01:11:40,993 --> 01:11:43,078
Stay away!

407
01:11:59,386 --> 01:12:01,096
Adam?

408
01:12:02,889 --> 01:12:04,975
What's happening?

409
01:12:08,687 --> 01:12:10,605
Adam?

410
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Adam?

411
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:31,585
Adam?

412
01:12:34,588 --> 01:12:36,465
No!

413
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:40,093
No! No!

414
01:12:41,136 --> 01:12:42,929
Claire!

415
01:12:46,558 --> 01:12:48,560
Claire!

416
01:12:56,943 --> 01:12:58,945
Claire!

417
01:14:36,293 --> 01:14:38,337
Claire!

418
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:00,734
Claire!

419
01:17:20,874 --> 01:17:22,834
Please, I need help!

420
01:17:24,586 --> 01:17:26,421
Please.

421
01:17:26,838 --> 01:17:28,882
Thank you.

422
01:17:30,968 --> 01:17:32,844
Oh, thank...

423
01:17:37,391 --> 01:17:38,959
Get away from here.

424
01:17:39,059 --> 01:17:41,253
You... you have to help us.

425
01:17:41,353 --> 01:17:43,397
I already did.

426
01:17:44,147 --> 01:17:46,525
I know, but please.

427
01:17:47,234 --> 01:17:49,778
I can't help you. I can't.

428
01:17:50,278 --> 01:17:52,531
They took my Cora.

429
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:55,450
They took my little girl.

430
01:17:56,994 --> 01:17:59,079
They take what we love most, and...

431
01:18:01,748 --> 01:18:04,668
Be gone now before you
bring them down here.

432
01:18:05,544 --> 01:18:09,047
Take my baby, please. Just until morning.

433
01:18:09,381 --> 01:18:13,035
- Please, Colm, please!
- He should've listened!

434
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:14,886
Go!

435
01:18:15,012 --> 01:18:16,722
Go!

436
01:18:20,726 --> 01:18:23,437
You should never have come here!

437
01:18:59,056 --> 01:19:00,557
Cora?

438
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No, Cora.

439
01:22:51,246 --> 01:22:52,998
Claire?

440
01:23:02,633 --> 01:23:04,051
Adam?

441
01:23:16,897 --> 01:23:19,107
I got him back.

442
01:23:19,608 --> 01:23:22,761
- What is that?
- It's... it's Finn.

443
01:23:22,861 --> 01:23:25,280
No. Adam, no.

444
01:23:32,162 --> 01:23:34,748
That's why they're here.

445
01:23:36,166 --> 01:23:38,377
They want... Finn.

446
01:23:41,755 --> 01:23:44,591
They want him for their family.

447
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,139
Take him.

448
01:23:53,684 --> 01:23:56,795
Leave that thing. It's one of them.

449
01:23:56,895 --> 01:24:00,357
It's... it's nothing. It's a trick.

450
01:24:12,828 --> 01:24:14,079
Adam!

451
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Claire... take him.
Take him.

452
01:25:00,459 --> 01:25:02,169
Adam?

453
01:25:04,046 --> 01:25:05,964
I did...

454
01:29:17,382 --> 01:29:20,218
You're so beautiful.
