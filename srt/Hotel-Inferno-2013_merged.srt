1
00:01:38,128 --> 00:01:39,829
LOVE =)

2
00:01:39,853 --> 00:01:41,417
Affection. Did I wake you?

3
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:43,211
Si.

4
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:45,831
I'm sorry honey.
I forgot about the time difference.

5
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:47,217
What time is it there?

6
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:48,963
Early.
Too early.

7
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:52,800
I'm sorry honey.
I'll call you later then.

8
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:55,632
No. You woke me up.
Now he talks.

9
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,655
I was waiting for your call yesterday.

10
00:01:57,797 --> 00:01:59,133
What happened?

11
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:01,404
Yes, I know, but I have not
had time to call you.

12
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:02,669
You know how it is.

13
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,355
If ... work.

14
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:06,853
Your job is blonde or brunette?

15
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:10,560
Do not say that.

16
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:12,534
You know I would never cheat you.

17
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:13,351
Yes, yes.

18
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,405
Honey, I have to go. I'll call you
in a few minutes, okay?

19
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:17,495
Agree, disagree.

20
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:19,505
- I love you. 
- Yes, yes.

21
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:39,397
STARTING

22
00:02:57,464 --> 00:02:59,454
We arrived.
Pull over there.

23
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,939
- Keep the change. 
- Oh God! Thank you sir.

24
00:03:08,113 --> 00:03:09,423
It is my money, dude.

25
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:13,212
- Hi. 
- Sir Zimosa?

26
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:15,584
- Yes sir. 
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

27
00:03:15,593 --> 00:03:19,787
Mistrandia am Jorge,
President of Lumen Company.

28
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:22,325
First I want to apologize for ...

29
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:24,241
Get in touch with you so late.

30
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:27,189
The other day I spoke with my partner.

31
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:29,693
Unfortunately I could not serve you...

32
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:31,101
Due to prior commitments.

33
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:33,680
This time I prefer to
speak directly with you...

34
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:35,671
And explain everything personally.

35
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:38,529
No problem. His collaborator
was clear enough,

36
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:40,639
then this is definitely
not a problem for me.

37
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:42,384
I enjoy your long journey?

38
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:46,028
Yes. They were 12 hour flight,
but I'm used to traveling.

39
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:49,435
What about the hotel?
Do staff suspected something from you?

40
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,385
- No. 
- Do you really believe...

41
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:52,902
You are regular customer?

42
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:55,691
Definitely yes.
I do not think there to worry about.

43
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,683
Perfect.
Very well then.

44
00:03:57,788 --> 00:04:01,319
I see you wearing the glasses
that we provided to you.

45
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:02,560
How are you feeling?

46
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:03,874
I feel great.

47
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:06,016
Honestly, I've never seen
anything like this.

48
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:08,321
And you can see well?
Is there a problem?

49
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:09,668
Are visual defects?

50
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:12,415
Basically I see some
things cost techniques.

51
00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:15,124
But I do not know what they mean.
But everything is in order.

52
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:17,484
I can see through them
like normal glasses.

53
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:20,901
It is important that you
do not remove, for any reason.

54
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:23,775
We have to record everything
and we have to be connected ...

55
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:25,783
At all times during the mission.

56
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:28,540
So you really see through
my eyes right now?

57
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:32,912
Yes. We see everything
you see on our monitors.

58
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:36,038
Agreed. Basically,
this is just a spy camera.

59
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:37,292
More or less.

60
00:04:37,305 --> 00:04:38,668
For me, that's fine.

61
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:42,729
Not the first time that my
clients ask me to record my work.

62
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:45,546
Oh, thanks for reminding me.

63
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:47,793
Given the nature of their work,

64
00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:51,171
I kindly ask you not to talk about it.

65
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:53,778
People do not speak English there,

66
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,177
but it is better to prevent any problems.

67
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:58,725
When you ask embarrassing questions...

68
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,855
Please just answer "yes" or "no".

69
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:02,830
Yes sir.

70
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:04,735
Here I have your file.

71
00:05:04,748 --> 00:05:08,869
I read that you were in Iraq
during the 1991 Gulf War.

72
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:09,873
Si.

73
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,189
You were discharged for
insubordination, right?

74
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:14,411
Yes.

75
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:18,314
Then I read about it
in Bosnia. 1993-1995.

76
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:21,436
I guess I was no longer
in the army here.

77
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:24,080
- It was mercenary. 
- Yes sir.

78
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:28,449
Then I see murderer for hire,
from 2005 onwards.

79
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:32,869
Yes. Working for individuals
and small organizations.

80
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:34,975
Criminal organizations, you mean.

81
00:05:34,988 --> 00:05:36,896
- Not only that. 
- All right.

82
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:41,299
I am sending a photo of one
of his previous targets.

83
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:44,087
Could you please confirm receipt?

84
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,415
Would I will send a photo?

85
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,925
Oh, excuse me.

86
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:49,911
These glasses are basically
a small computer.

87
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:52,865
You will see the text appear.

88
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:56,449
Just press down on the left, in glasses,

89
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:58,867
to accept the file download.

90
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,657
- All right. 
- Wait one second.

91
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,342
Agreed. Already she has been sent.
Please accept it.

92
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:07,903
Yes, I do not remember the
date of this contract...

93
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,365
But I remember the client and
the person in the photos.

94
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:12,563
Honestly, I'm not proud of this work,

95
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:15,539
but the client asked me
something quite rare.

96
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:17,388
I think it was revenge for something.

97
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:20,217
Anyway, I'm a professional,
and I completed my work.

98
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,386
We think he'll be perfect for this job.

99
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,382
We like the way you work.

100
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:29,535
I mean, photos,
see you have talent.

101
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:33,134
Sir, would you I can ask a question now?

102
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:34,274
Si.

103
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:37,503
Does your organization is
linked to the government?

104
00:06:37,616 --> 00:06:39,732
No. Definitely not.

105
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:44,050
I mean, I've never seen anything
how are you glasses, in the army,

106
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:45,220
or on the market.

107
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:48,436
So I can conclude that
this is a prototype?

108
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,636
- Right? 
- Yes.

109
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:52,837
I mean, this kind of shit
is expensive to manufacture.

110
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,863
Normally only related organizations...

111
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:58,630
We collect funds every
time we complete a mission.

112
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:01,607
And we have done many missions.
That is all.

113
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,015
For the amount of money
they're paying me,

114
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:06,607
it seems they are in this
business since the Middle Ages.

115
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,141
More or less.

116
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:12,577
Very good. It's time to talk
about his current mission.

117
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,243
I kindly ask you to speak from now on,

118
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:19,108
because the goals are next to your room.

119
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:20,230
Agreed.

120
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:22,798
As I explain my colleague,

121
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:25,525
We need two people to kill us.

122
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:28,037
A couple.
A man and a woman.

123
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:32,615
They killed more than 150 people
in the last five years.

124
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:36,453
The police and the FBI
could not find them,

125
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:40,126
they did not know who was
responsible for those deaths.

126
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,789
But we do know who they are
and what they have done.

127
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:45,203
And how do you know?

128
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:48,150
The couple has sent us
pictures of his victims.

129
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:51,367
This is just weird.
Would you send pictures? Why?

130
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,581
They know our organization.

131
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:57,011
It's like we are challenging.

132
00:07:57,024 --> 00:07:59,801
So, your agency hunt serial murderers?

133
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:01,217
Usually, no.

134
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,835
Well, this is not my business.
Pardon me for asking, sir.

135
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:08,975
So, just want to kill those people.

136
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,195
Exactly.

137
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:13,063
They are in the room next to hers.

138
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,488
They do not know they will,
and surely will surprise.

139
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:18,902
The room key is a master key...

140
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,886
And you can easily walk into any
room of the hotel with her.

141
00:08:22,608 --> 00:08:24,103
Now we have to show you...

142
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:26,757
A video of the murder they sent us,

143
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,544
for you to understand what
kind of people will face.

144
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:33,558
We need a dark background for viewing.

145
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:36,714
You know ... The glasses do not
play the videos properly,

146
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:38,216
by bright environment.

147
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,684
Can you please just close the curtains?

148
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:41,718
Yes sir.

149
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:18,067
This shit is just weird.

150
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,969
I say. I have seen very fucking
things in my life, but I do not know...

151
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:26,510
This is different.
There seem random killings.

152
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:29,266
This seems to be some kind
of ritualistic murder.

153
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,291
I showed this video just
to warn you, Mr. Zimosa.

154
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:35,537
In underestimate these personas.

155
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,722
They are dangerous, and somehow...

156
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:39,834
Are professionals like you.

157
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:43,317
It has to be silent,
and kill them one at a time.

158
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,149
Noiselessly.
And most importantly,

159
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:49,648
do not let them talk.

160
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:50,376
Agreed.

161
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,192
The mission will begin at...

162
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:56,741
Man must take a shower,
at that time,

163
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:59,310
then it should be easy for you,
kill them separately.

164
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:01,141
- Yes sir. 
- Absolutely,

165
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:02,989
We do not want to use weapons.

166
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,938
We want to use the weapons
that we provided to you.

167
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,748
- Yes sir. 
- They're in the closet,

168
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:09,747
near the entrance, to the left.

169
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,200
It is necessary to crush their
skulls and extract their brains,

170
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,094
open their stomachs and
removed the entrails.

171
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:21,205
It must be in that order,
and we have to see everything.

172
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:22,474
It is also rare.

173
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:25,261
But you pay me enough
to not ask questions.

174
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:26,575
Or have doubts.

175
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:30,019
Perfect, Mr. Zimosa.
We will now disconnect.

176
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:32,797
Obviously, we will not talk
to you during the mission.

177
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,191
But we will see everything.

178
00:10:47,411 --> 00:10:50,663
Honey, I'm done.
We can talk now.

179
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:52,578
Yes, I know.
But I'm busy now.

180
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:54,733
Do you have something
important to tell me?

181
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:55,990
Not only ...

182
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:57,927
I just wanted to talk to you.

183
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,738
I just saw something and wanted
to know if you're okay.

184
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:04,521
You called me four minutes ago,
of course I'm fine.

185
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:06,056
Yes.
You're right.

186
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:07,982
What's going on?
You're acting weird.

187
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:08,858
It's nothing.

188
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:12,341
It was a mistake to call.
You alarmed without reason.

189
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:14,225
All is well.

190
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:16,681
I just saw something,
and needed to call.

191
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:18,339
Did you see anything?

192
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:20,134
Something to do with your work, you mean.

193
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:21,520
獨hat strange things...

194
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,484
Could have been a software engineer?

195
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,881
Strange A cable?

196
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,531
Si.

197
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:32,555
I just... I...
I wanted to hear your voice.

198
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,584
Well, listen.
I have to go, okay?

199
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:36,947
- I'll talk to you later. 
- Very well then.

200
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:38,825
I love you.

201
00:14:32,353 --> 00:14:34,262
What the hell is this?

202
00:14:36,354 --> 00:14:38,361
What ... what ... fuck?

203
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:40,807
Hey you!

204
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:43,613
I'm talking to you, Mistrandia.

205
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,043
How the hell do I connect to this shit?

206
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,515
Can you hear me?

207
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:52,967
Why use the same damn glasses?

208
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:08,732
I feel hot.

209
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:12,131
Oh, too hot.

210
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:18,418
I knew they would send someone like you...

211
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:20,738
To kill me and my girl.

212
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:23,586
I knew that would remove me from this,

213
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:25,360
sooner or later.

214
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:30,428
But I...

215
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:34,394
I do not expect that to happen...

216
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:36,551
Today.

217
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:39,737
What the hell are you talking about?

218
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,396
Hey! I'm talking to you.

219
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,479
Look at me!

220
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:46,349
I was hired...

221
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,276
And my girl...

222
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:50,471
Exactly as they did...

223
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:52,008
With you.

224
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:55,115
Oh. Why were we not alone?

225
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:59,355
And we did a lot of work for them.

226
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:01,714
You will become...

227
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,101
Like us...

228
00:16:03,286 --> 00:16:05,352
If you continue...

229
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:07,077
Working for them.

230
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:10,940
You will be asked to do...

231
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:12,635
Bad things.

232
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,330
Very bad.

233
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,524
Just so you can feed.

234
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:21,677
She feeds on pain.

235
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,947
She needs to be fed...

236
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,105
Continuously.

237
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:35,689
The more you feed...

238
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:41,425
You'll be more like us.

239
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:43,889
Fuck this. 
No weapons, right?

240
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:50,923
You better explain to me what
the hell is going on!

241
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:53,429
Calm down, sir Zimosa.

242
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:57,390
I'll explain this later, okay?
Now, relax.

243
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,438
And whatever I say.

244
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,029
Take out any open his skull and brain.

245
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:04,462
Then, open the stomach and
draw off the entrails,

246
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:08,069
or there will be serious problems.

247
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:10,614
Fuck you, asshole!
I'm done with this shit.

248
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:14,438
There are serial murderers.
His men are just right?

249
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,998
You asked them to commit
all those murders.

250
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:20,247
Who the fuck are you?
Why he does it?

251
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,311
You will not understand now.
Just do what I said.

252
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:25,166
I'll explain later.

253
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:27,886
What if I break the damn
glasses, asshole,

254
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:30,998
and return to my country?
That's what I'll do!

255
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:32,778
Do not do that.

256
00:17:33,023 --> 00:17:36,652
Once you start to kill us,
you can not return.

257
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:38,481
Want to know what's going on?

258
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:42,510
I can not explain everything,
because you do not understand everything now.

259
00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:44,646
I can only say that
killed two of my men...

260
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:46,285
They were not more efficient.

261
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,655
It was necessary, and did a good job.

262
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:52,113
You replace them and
be part of my team.

263
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:53,041
That is all.

264
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:56,193
Why we kill people?
It is inevitable.

265
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:59,353
You can not understand now.
You'll understand later.

266
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:02,583
Just trust me.

267
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:04,382
I assure you...

268
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:06,366
Consider this work as an honor,

269
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,222
as all my men.

270
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:10,950
If you only knew what
we're doing here...

271
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:13,287
Now, do what I said,

272
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,772
and everything will be fine.

273
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:16,563
。alles!

274
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:30,207
Do not fuck with us, Zimosa!

275
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:33,468
You can not imagine how many idiots...

276
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:35,312
They have tried to do what it will do,

277
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,441
many, many years, even before
you were born.

278
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:42,697
I warn you...

279
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,481
If it's not what I said,

280
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:47,927
she'll go there, because the
ritual is incomplete.

281
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,840
And he begs God to his not being born.

282
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:56,431
If you wake up, it is very
difficult to get to sleep again.

283
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:59,195
That will mean we will all
be in big trouble.

284
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,377
All of us!

285
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:04,818
So I have to ask my men to solve shit.

286
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,023
And I assure you will not like my men.

287
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:12,644
You think it's the only
murderer in this Hotel?

288
00:19:12,657 --> 00:19:15,230
There are other people who
work for me. Many more.

289
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:18,488
That place is mine!
One of the many places that I have.

290
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:21,765
Yes, there are common customers,
public employees,

291
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:24,472
but that's just on the surface.

292
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:28,573
My men were ready to intervene,
when I go into that room.

293
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:30,948
They are waiting in
their private rooms...

294
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,253
Just in case something...

295
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:33,376
- Go wrong. 
- Fuck.

296
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:37,071
And it seems that things
are going badly.

297
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:38,191
Go to hell!

298
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:40,592
You will never survive there.

299
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:42,633
And even if it gets out of my men,

300
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:44,935
Never survive to it!

301
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:47,583
It's going to be hell.

302
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fuck.
What the fuck?
Shit.

303
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Hey, man.
You came into my room!

304
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:51,566
Relax.

305
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,279
You you could not go, so I came in.

306
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:54,551
I'm just a customer.

307
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:56,966
- Then you should go from here. 
- I just lost it.

308
00:22:57,379 --> 00:22:59,330
You do not have to call security.

309
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:01,342
I'll just go back to my room.

310
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:04,473
Right? You can finish
painting the walls.

311
00:23:04,497 --> 00:23:05,626
It's okay?

312
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,377
Or whatever it is you're doing here.

313
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:10,267
To hell! okay okay.

314
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,262
Thank you.

315
00:23:11,613 --> 00:23:13,646
So I can just go, right?

316
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:16,655
Is there another way out?

317
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:29,465
–amos!

318
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:16,342
Fuck. Fuck. Shit!

319
00:24:17,517 --> 00:24:18,881
Shit.

320
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:24,386
Oh shit!

321
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:32,393
Son of a bitch.

322
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,997
Fuck.

323
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:43,300
Piece of shit.

324
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:50,840
Damn!

325
00:25:22,528 --> 00:25:23,992
Fuck!

326
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:43,346
Fuck this shit!

327
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:44,609
﹑o, no, no!

328
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:48,272
No, no. Please!

329
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:53,564
Fuck.

330
00:25:56,432 --> 00:25:58,279
Fuck this shit.

331
00:25:59,444 --> 00:26:01,120
Fuck!

332
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:02,346
Fuck this shit!

333
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:18,152
﹒h, vamos!

334
00:26:23,643 --> 00:26:25,726
Fuck this shit.

335
00:26:26,741 --> 00:26:28,180
–amos!

336
00:26:30,942 --> 00:26:32,211
–amos!

337
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:35,844
Fuck!

338
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:42,812
Fuck. Die demon!

339
00:26:53,757 --> 00:26:56,670
Oh fuck! Oh fuck!

340
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,308
Fuck. Fuck!

341
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:35,438
Oh no. No, fuck you.

342
00:27:39,754 --> 00:27:42,634
No... Fuck.

343
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:54,770
Agreed.

344
00:28:00,256 --> 00:28:01,521
Fuck.

345
00:28:02,486 --> 00:28:04,073
﹒h no!

346
00:28:05,432 --> 00:28:06,338
Agreed.

347
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,001
What the fuck?

348
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:10,668
All right! All right!

349
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,160
All right! All right!

350
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,735
Oh fuck!

351
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,732
Fuck!

352
00:28:22,006 --> 00:28:22,969
Shit.

353
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,225
Oh shit!

354
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:32,959
Come on.

355
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:36,070
Oh fuck!

356
00:28:42,662 --> 00:28:44,203
Fuck.

357
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:50,011
Oh shit!

358
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,171
PERSONNEL ONLY

359
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:12,758
I bet you're wondering:

360
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:16,869
Why bastards plastic cover everything?

361
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:20,071
As I said, this hotel is just a front...

362
00:29:20,084 --> 00:29:21,911
For our real organization.

363
00:29:21,924 --> 00:29:24,652
At the same time,
we want real guests...

364
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:26,735
They know what we actually do here.

365
00:29:26,748 --> 00:29:29,479
We do not want to paint the walls
and furniture with their blood,

366
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,623
when my men to do her pieces.

367
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,965
You have no idea how hard it is...

368
00:29:35,978 --> 00:29:38,221
Remove the bloodstains of furniture.

369
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,916
And most importantly:

370
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:44,255
I do not think red would fit
well with the decor.

371
00:29:44,268 --> 00:29:47,613
Va a arruinar el "Feng Shui".

372
00:34:12,102 --> 00:34:15,067
I'm surprised he's still alive.

373
00:34:15,143 --> 00:34:18,329
And I am surprised
how stupid it is.

374
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:22,329
It is located in one of the
secret areas of the hotel.

375
00:34:22,342 --> 00:34:26,847
It is where my people live.
It is your personal space on them.

376
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,904
Hidden surface and people.

377
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:32,935
I know it's not as great
as the standard rooms...

378
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:34,471
But that's where they live.

379
00:34:34,484 --> 00:34:37,319
Of course, everyone is looking for him...

380
00:34:37,332 --> 00:34:39,910
In the hotel, so that area is empty,

381
00:34:39,967 --> 00:34:43,302
but if you were,
you would be quiet anyway.

382
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:46,081
Perhaps there is someone
still there, waiting for you.

383
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

384
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,350
Oh shit!

385
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,094
Do you see that?

386
00:37:26,231 --> 00:37:29,388
I bet you're seeing
a small hidden camera.

387
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:31,815
I just hope that the
resolution is high enough...

388
00:37:31,828 --> 00:37:33,471
To have seen your brain get away.

389
00:37:35,135 --> 00:37:37,185
I thank you.

390
00:37:37,198 --> 00:37:40,532
She will calm down for
a few minutes as a result.

391
00:37:40,545 --> 00:37:42,368
Thanks, of heart.

392
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:44,245
What the hell are you talking about?

393
00:37:44,258 --> 00:37:45,998
I just killed one of his men,

394
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,326
sick bastard.
He does not care?

395
00:37:48,341 --> 00:37:52,340
Hey, Mr. Zimosa,
we need to calm pain,

396
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:54,563
but she wants yours.

397
00:37:54,744 --> 00:37:57,646
My men just need to capture...

398
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:01,238
And produce enough pain to calm her.

399
00:38:01,251 --> 00:38:04,354
Who is this "it"?
Whose talking about?

400
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:07,302
Are you doing all this shit for "her"?

401
00:38:07,337 --> 00:38:10,186
Is a woman?
Is your bitch?

402
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:13,453
Poor idiot.
You are not able to understand.

403
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:16,598
And I really have no words
to waste with you.

404
00:38:16,611 --> 00:38:19,046
But if it survives back to my men,

405
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:22,560
I promise I'll explain the situation.

406
00:38:22,573 --> 00:38:25,026
Does that sound right to you?

407
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,186
His sarcasm is not even funny.

408
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:29,617
You just put gasoline on the fire.

409
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,503
Because I catch you.
You can bet on it.

410
00:38:32,516 --> 00:38:34,841
And when caught, I will pay...

411
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,768
Every time I tried to annoy me, asshole.

412
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:42,177
Poor deluded.
You think I'm there?

413
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,056
I'm not even in the country,
wretched idiot.

414
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:49,712
How can you imagine
taking a plane and catch?

415
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:56,392
When you find it,
I'll kill ten times, asshole.

416
00:38:56,413 --> 00:38:58,928
What does there?

417
00:38:58,941 --> 00:39:02,136
Are you trying to escape, poor fool?

418
00:39:02,149 --> 00:39:05,560
That door can only be opened by my men.

419
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:09,117
Then, in a few minutes,
you will be surrounded.

420
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,812
Really? Just his men can
open this door?

421
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,128
Shit.

422
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:20,819
What? Does the idiot has
found the solution?

423
00:40:42,891 --> 00:40:44,599
ROOM 1006

424
00:40:49,523 --> 00:40:51,471
OUT GARDEN

425
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:55,289
I'm pretty sure that this
map will not help much,

426
00:40:55,302 --> 00:40:59,312
and my men know every
corridor of this Hotel.

427
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:03,942
Each of the rooms,
every little secret passage.

428
00:41:03,955 --> 00:41:06,774
But please, have fun trying
to find a way out of there.

429
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:27,310
Wow! You discovered
another secret area.

430
00:41:27,323 --> 00:41:28,792
I'm impressed.

431
00:41:28,994 --> 00:41:33,100
It really is a very
good scout Boy Scout.

432
00:41:33,113 --> 00:41:36,945
I give the Medal of Snoopy.

433
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:38,329
He's crazy!

434
00:41:38,342 --> 00:41:42,550
He is just playing cat
and mouse with me.

435
00:41:42,563 --> 00:41:46,510
Do you really think that I will
really listen to you?

436
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:50,457
No! I know it's so stupid,
he was convinced that even...

437
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,927
That what you said...

438
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,569
It's true. But it is so far
from the truth,

439
00:41:55,582 --> 00:41:57,530
that you can not even imagine.

440
00:41:57,543 --> 00:42:00,249
Did my men seem normal to you?

441
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:03,376
Have you ever seen someone
with this disease in your life?

442
00:42:03,508 --> 00:42:06,945
Even an idiot like you should
have some doubts...

443
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,105
In this point.

444
00:42:08,118 --> 00:42:09,336
What are you talking about?

445
00:42:09,352 --> 00:42:11,839
What am I talking about?

446
00:42:11,852 --> 00:42:14,510
That's the price of feed.

447
00:42:14,523 --> 00:42:19,408
As my first man tried to explain
to his deluded phrases.

448
00:42:19,421 --> 00:42:22,450
When the feeds, year after year,

449
00:42:22,463 --> 00:42:24,698
the bodies begin to get sick.

450
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:28,949
The brain starts to swell.
Pus begins to occur.

451
00:42:28,962 --> 00:42:33,482
The skin starts to burn,
and the language begins to dry.

452
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:37,749
The glands then rot.
The organs stop functioning.

453
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:40,796
Gangrene spreads.

454
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:44,597
Then, the tumors grow
in the heart decaying

455
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,213
and death comes soon.

456
00:42:48,626 --> 00:42:51,656
Many of them have even already face.

457
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,625
But still pouring,

458
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:57,095
with passion and dedication.

459
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:01,241
Hayo absurd to think
that these poor sick...

460
00:43:01,254 --> 00:43:03,167
They are more efficient than you.

461
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,463
All that good health is
wasted without purpose.

462
00:43:06,476 --> 00:43:09,271
He deserves to die, just for that.

463
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:11,006
It's a crazy son of a bitch.

464
00:43:11,136 --> 00:43:14,020
And I do not understand a word he says.

465
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:17,404
Do not worry, you will understand,
if he survives a little longer.

466
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,654
What the fuck?

467
00:43:55,862 --> 00:43:57,619
OUTPUT

468
00:46:05,255 --> 00:46:06,524
Here's them!

469
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:00,271
–amos!

470
00:49:10,273 --> 00:49:11,171
Fuck!

471
00:50:31,081 --> 00:50:32,797
Fuck this shit.

472
00:50:38,284 --> 00:50:39,658
Fuck!

473
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:52,575
Fuck!

474
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,901
–amos! ﹒h, come on!

475
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:19,144
Damn!

476
00:51:54,293 --> 00:51:56,462
﹒h, no, no, no!

477
00:52:18,995 --> 00:52:21,497
–amos! –amos!

478
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:23,100
Damn!

479
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,768
Fuck this shit!

480
00:52:33,098 --> 00:52:34,396
Fuck this shit.

481
00:53:14,402 --> 00:53:17,491
See? Have you seen what he did?

482
00:53:17,504 --> 00:53:21,803
That sound! That's the sound
it makes when she's angry.

483
00:53:21,816 --> 00:53:25,527
When a creature of them is angry,
it means only one thing:

484
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,125
Problems.
A fucking mountain of problems!

485
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:32,277
And all this only because
I did not hear me.

486
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:33,622
Who are you?

487
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,702
I told him who I am.

488
00:53:35,811 --> 00:53:38,525
My name is Jorge Mistrandia.

489
00:53:38,538 --> 00:53:40,678
Who is in reality be damned?

490
00:53:40,813 --> 00:53:44,225
What are you doing here?
What the fuck is that?

491
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,145
I am a collector.

492
00:53:46,616 --> 00:53:50,166
For generations, my family
have been collecting things...

493
00:53:50,179 --> 00:53:54,560
In a world in which human
consciousness has ceased to exist.

494
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:56,715
A world where people like you...

495
00:53:56,728 --> 00:53:58,947
Describe with stupid words...

496
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,028
Like unspeakable, suffered,
demonic, as another dimension.

497
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:03,875
And stupid shit like that.

498
00:54:04,524 --> 00:54:08,586
There were times when the
line between the two worlds,

499
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:11,170
ours and theirs, was dim.

500
00:54:11,183 --> 00:54:13,047
Humans can feel the...

501
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,801
Presence across more clearly.

502
00:54:15,825 --> 00:54:20,226
The time that people like you
would define as the "dark".

503
00:54:20,629 --> 00:54:24,808
But somehow, those times
are more enlightened.

504
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:30,778
The pain and fear keep
those closed doors.

505
00:54:31,032 --> 00:54:36,550
The more pain we have here,
the more they stay calm in his world.

506
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:40,094
It's like a balance.
No pain here,

507
00:54:40,118 --> 00:54:42,621
They are forced to enter.

508
00:54:42,634 --> 00:54:44,955
It's a pretty simple concept.

509
00:54:44,968 --> 00:54:48,730
Just imagine a lake,
where the waters begin to fade.

510
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,521
The fish will try to jump out.

511
00:54:50,534 --> 00:54:55,385
Jump out is not a solution.
It's just an inevitable reaction.

512
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:59,736
The pain will never cease
to exist in this world.

513
00:54:59,749 --> 00:55:01,899
But it can decrease, sometimes.

514
00:55:01,912 --> 00:55:05,315
And when that happens,
some of them can pass through.

515
00:55:05,328 --> 00:55:09,012
Some creatures should remain
in their world, to survive.

516
00:55:09,036 --> 00:55:10,955
Others may live in both worlds.

517
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,702
They enter and exit
through those doors.

518
00:55:18,249 --> 00:55:21,180
"She" is one of those.
One of many.

519
00:55:21,195 --> 00:55:23,757
It is quite common in the world.

520
00:55:23,796 --> 00:55:25,504
But it is rare here.

521
00:55:25,517 --> 00:55:28,464
My family has captured
many years in Italy,

522
00:55:28,477 --> 00:55:31,257
as they did with many other
different creatures,

523
00:55:31,339 --> 00:55:35,143
in several other countries,
in many different years.

524
00:55:35,156 --> 00:55:39,248
But to keep it here,
in this world, no problems,

525
00:55:39,261 --> 00:55:42,243
We must meet certain requirements.

526
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:44,032
With a double dose.

527
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,628
If you adopt a cat,
you need to give a good meal,

528
00:55:47,641 --> 00:55:50,893
and a house warm, if you want
your happiness, right?

529
00:55:50,906 --> 00:55:53,724
In fact, she is sleeping
or something similar.

530
00:55:53,748 --> 00:55:57,125
Sleeping since 480.

531
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:21,548
Just consider that during
the Middle Ages,

532
00:56:21,668 --> 00:56:26,108
My family often propagate
the plague in Europe...

533
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:29,699
To satisfy their need
for pain and suffering.

534
00:56:29,712 --> 00:56:33,484
It really is a huge banquet
for her, is not it sir?

535
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:35,677
So I like to call:

536
00:56:35,737 --> 00:56:37,871
Propagator of the plague.

537
00:56:40,175 --> 00:56:41,998
I find it hilarious.

538
00:56:42,076 --> 00:56:46,069
When taking the place of my parents,
I did something similar,

539
00:56:46,082 --> 00:56:49,118
a cleaner and less visible form,
so to speak.

540
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:50,673
In a modern way.

541
00:56:50,881 --> 00:56:54,659
With these glasses
can be recorded pain.

542
00:56:54,683 --> 00:56:58,872
Innocent suffering frozen
into digital data...

543
00:56:58,885 --> 00:57:00,572
And transmitted to it.

544
00:57:00,685 --> 00:57:04,137
It is pure pain is like feeding a cat...

545
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:05,274
With canned food.

546
00:57:05,387 --> 00:57:09,513
But it works, because it is
straightforward and nothing is wasted.

547
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:12,166
Therefore, we need not
extend the plague again.

548
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:17,676
Yes, feed has its contradictions.

549
00:57:17,736 --> 00:57:20,139
Consume glasses.

550
00:57:20,193 --> 00:57:23,690
You see, many of my men
are not in good health.

551
00:57:23,784 --> 00:57:28,008
Ironically, the result is similar
to the symptoms of the plague.

552
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:31,739
But it is necessary and they
accept the risk, for the cause.

553
00:57:31,997 --> 00:57:36,852
Everything is balanced to ensure
that it continues sleeping,

554
00:57:36,945 --> 00:57:38,764
in all its beauty.

555
00:57:38,777 --> 00:57:41,492
Are you killing innocent people
to maintain that balance?

556
00:57:41,846 --> 00:57:43,299
Is that what you're doing?

557
00:57:43,303 --> 00:57:46,910
Do you think that's an excuse
to do this monstrosity?

558
00:57:46,949 --> 00:57:49,928
You do not understand a word, idiot.

559
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:53,443
I'm not trying to save the world.
The pain in this world is...

560
00:57:53,456 --> 00:57:55,090
That can not be destroyed.

561
00:57:55,103 --> 00:57:56,978
That balance is indestructible.

562
00:57:57,009 --> 00:57:59,608
No one can change for better or worse.

563
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,691
I love my children.
I want my collection.

564
00:58:02,704 --> 00:58:05,315
They belonged to my
family for centuries.

565
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:07,578
They are my trophies!

566
00:58:07,591 --> 00:58:12,051
But there are rules I must
follow to keep quiet here.

567
00:58:12,064 --> 00:58:14,108
And if you do not want
to be killed by it,

568
00:58:14,132 --> 00:58:16,142
I have to create a small...

569
00:58:16,172 --> 00:58:19,359
Extra balance of pain to feed,
that's all.

570
00:58:24,117 --> 00:58:27,254
So you're not a villain
to save the world...

571
00:58:27,267 --> 00:58:29,443
You have to do something bad,
but inevitable.

572
00:58:29,456 --> 00:58:31,312
It does nothing but feed their pets.

573
00:58:31,334 --> 00:58:33,718
It's just that other rich bastard...

574
00:58:33,768 --> 00:58:35,111
With a love sick.

575
00:58:35,124 --> 00:58:38,265
With or without another world,
with or without monsters...

576
00:58:38,764 --> 00:58:42,372
Nothing special.
Just another idiot.

577
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:45,647
You do not understand.
They have much to teach.

578
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,140
If you show all the knowledge
we get from them,

579
00:58:48,317 --> 00:58:51,453
his little brain would
melt like butter.

580
00:58:51,466 --> 00:58:52,492
Fuck!

581
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,645
"Fuck."
That's the same stupid answer...

582
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:58,005
He gave me, before all this started.

583
00:58:58,075 --> 00:59:01,357
He was about to reveal a new world.

584
00:59:01,534 --> 00:59:05,000
And your answer is "fuck"?

585
00:59:05,134 --> 00:59:08,092
He does not realize that his idiocy,

586
00:59:08,105 --> 00:59:10,344
Have you broken your sleep cycle?

587
00:59:10,357 --> 00:59:14,463
He is awake only because it did
not proceed with these murders.

588
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,926
My men try to produce
the required pain...

589
00:59:17,939 --> 00:59:19,374
To keep sleeping again.

590
00:59:19,387 --> 00:59:22,350
But did his best to evit嫫noslo...

591
00:59:22,363 --> 00:59:24,365
And he is now hungry.

592
00:59:24,642 --> 00:59:26,320
And angry.

593
00:59:26,743 --> 00:59:32,098
If you do not find the solution,
I will be forced to destroy the structure.

594
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:34,667
False Hotel.
Including her.

595
00:59:34,948 --> 00:59:38,872
She is one of the best articles
of my precious collection.

596
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:40,568
And I do not want to lose.

597
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:43,525
It belongs to my family since 400 AD

598
00:59:43,617 --> 00:59:46,540
And I can not erase
1600 years of efforts...

599
00:59:46,553 --> 00:59:48,107
Because of his idiocy.

600
00:59:48,142 --> 00:59:51,965
Let him suffer.
Suffer so much, so she fed.

601
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:56,857
She goes to sleep again and
everything will return...

602
01:00:07,644 --> 01:00:08,964
：omorrah!

603
01:00:29,048 --> 01:00:30,449
Oh shit!

604
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,502
- Honey? 
- Are you?

605
01:00:38,152 --> 01:00:39,225
Si.

606
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:42,021
What did you do to your voice?
You were Sleeping?

607
01:00:42,153 --> 01:00:45,524
Just I wanted you to know
that I will take a few days.

608
01:00:45,537 --> 01:00:48,100
Well!
What great news.

609
01:00:48,113 --> 01:00:53,111
Sorry, honey. Really I wanted
to be there. Now.

610
01:00:53,124 --> 01:00:55,759
What are you talking about?
Just shut up, please.

611
01:00:55,904 --> 01:00:57,753
I get upset when you make fun of me.

612
01:00:57,961 --> 01:01:01,030
You act like you're sad,
and that's just ridiculous.

613
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:03,848
I bet you're on a beach,
under the sun,

614
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:05,739
while I am here,
I am waiting like a fool.

615
01:01:05,752 --> 01:01:08,723
- Honey, please do not hang up. 
- Yes, yes. See you when you get back.

616
01:01:08,736 --> 01:01:12,098
I just wanted to say...
I just wanted to say ...

617
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,382
I love you.

618
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:28,821
Well, if one still believes
in these false gods...

619
01:01:28,834 --> 01:01:30,037
Your people invention,

620
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:31,886
you better start to pray to them now,

621
01:01:32,215 --> 01:01:34,349
because it is about to arrive.

622
01:01:34,387 --> 01:01:36,523
Already he broke the first barrier,

623
01:01:36,536 --> 01:01:38,772
and he is now running down the halls.

624
01:01:38,924 --> 01:01:41,900
Right under your feet.

625
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:54,725
﹑o, no, no, no!
﹑o, no, no, no!

626
01:03:55,194 --> 01:03:56,316
Damn!

627
01:04:38,598 --> 01:04:39,570
Fuck!

628
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,721
﹑o, no, no, no!
﹑o, no, no, no!

629
01:05:13,104 --> 01:05:16,565
Help me...
Help me...

630
01:05:37,008 --> 01:05:38,061
Shit.

631
01:06:01,411 --> 01:06:02,211
Very good.

632
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:05,832
Damn!

633
01:06:15,612 --> 01:06:16,630
Damn!

634
01:06:17,313 --> 01:06:18,405
–amos!

635
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:20,811
Fuck!

636
01:06:29,816 --> 01:06:30,845
Fuck!

637
01:06:32,617 --> 01:06:34,689
Fuck!

638
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,111
She can not be killed.

639
01:06:51,124 --> 01:06:52,862
Fuck!

640
01:07:01,723 --> 01:07:04,060
And I need him alive.

641
01:07:04,073 --> 01:07:04,809
Beautiful!

642
01:07:04,825 --> 01:07:05,883
Fuck!

643
01:07:28,729 --> 01:07:32,316
Wait a second ... what's this?
Deja vu?

644
01:07:32,431 --> 01:07:35,202
I've seen in that position, Mr. Zimosa.

645
01:07:35,215 --> 01:07:39,499
And I told you're about
to torture him to death, right?

646
01:07:39,512 --> 01:07:41,049
So what's happening?

647
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:45,867
I'm sick of your shit, Mistrandia.

648
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,289
And I said that's not funny.

649
01:07:48,376 --> 01:07:50,783
So if you want to kill me, go ahead.

650
01:07:50,883 --> 01:07:53,173
Kill me, or do what you want.

651
01:07:53,186 --> 01:07:56,366
I survive again.
And I'll find him,

652
01:07:56,379 --> 01:07:58,569
no matter where you are.

653
01:07:58,582 --> 01:08:01,183
This is not an easy task, Mr. Zimosa.

654
01:08:01,196 --> 01:08:03,773
I will change the mood around here.

655
01:08:03,786 --> 01:08:06,139
I do not like his arrogant tone.

656
01:08:06,152 --> 01:08:08,420
It is not what we need.

657
01:08:08,433 --> 01:08:10,571
He does not like at all.

658
01:08:10,648 --> 01:08:13,070
He's walking through the halls.

659
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:14,434
Can you hear it?

660
01:08:14,451 --> 01:08:17,252
She can not enter because
the door sealed,

661
01:08:17,297 --> 01:08:19,594
in a way that hurts.

662
01:08:19,765 --> 01:08:22,131
And that puts even more angry.

663
01:08:22,144 --> 01:08:23,754
He wants more pain.

664
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,865
Now she is like a heroin addict...

665
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,264
Looking for a dose.

666
01:08:27,357 --> 01:08:30,202
She needs!
And he wants you,

667
01:08:30,215 --> 01:08:32,841
because you, he has awakened.

668
01:08:32,905 --> 01:08:35,085
She can feel it.

669
01:08:35,098 --> 01:08:38,550
There is a kind of connection
between you and her, now,

670
01:08:38,607 --> 01:08:41,461
and never let you go.

671
01:08:41,474 --> 01:08:43,512
But I want to serve you well...

672
01:08:43,564 --> 01:08:46,384
As my parents did for centuries.

673
01:08:46,397 --> 01:08:48,530
Medieval style.

674
01:08:48,543 --> 01:08:50,482
Rusty metal, rotting wood.

675
01:08:50,569 --> 01:08:53,848
All ingredients remembers well.

676
01:08:55,771 --> 01:08:59,984
Do you know why the church tortured
people in the Middle Ages?

677
01:09:01,672 --> 01:09:04,749
Well, I think you can
understand that now.

678
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:09,577
You see, we teach many things today.

679
01:09:13,073 --> 01:09:15,058
I'll kill you, Mistrandia.

680
01:09:15,075 --> 01:09:17,327
No matter how many minions have.

681
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:20,369
And no matter how many demons called.

682
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:22,094
Nothing will protect you.

683
01:09:22,107 --> 01:09:24,451
But they never protected me, Zimosa.

684
01:09:24,464 --> 01:09:25,795
They just want the pain.

685
01:09:25,982 --> 01:09:28,415
That's why I do not like that...

686
01:09:28,428 --> 01:09:30,670
Continue to act as a super man there.

687
01:09:30,683 --> 01:09:33,388
And if you keep acting
the way he is acting,

688
01:09:33,401 --> 01:09:35,267
it will be so furious,

689
01:09:35,286 --> 01:09:37,911
that door can not contain it,

690
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:42,535
and I do not want to lose my last man
and most precious, Gomorrah.

691
01:09:43,289 --> 01:09:46,169
How is your girlfriend, Zimosa?

692
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:50,001
By her voice, she seems
like a very nice girl.

693
01:09:50,014 --> 01:09:51,269
Fuck!

694
01:09:51,492 --> 01:09:55,169
For his voice,
I bet it's blonde, right?

695
01:09:55,993 --> 01:09:58,924
I'll take the silence as a "yes."

696
01:09:59,194 --> 01:10:01,406
Green, eyes US ...

697
01:10:01,485 --> 01:10:03,953
But his father was Russian, right?

698
01:10:04,098 --> 01:10:08,137
By his voice, I can also feel
that she lives at home,

699
01:10:08,144 --> 01:10:11,952
Calle Madison, 1408, Chicago.

700
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:13,485
That's right?

701
01:10:15,101 --> 01:10:17,130
How the hell you know that?

702
01:10:22,203 --> 01:10:23,627
Poor idiot.

703
01:10:23,804 --> 01:10:29,269
Using Smartphone there was
not a very smart move.

704
01:10:33,706 --> 01:10:36,821
What was that, ironically,
said yesterday morning?

705
01:10:37,206 --> 01:10:40,691
"You have collected the money
from the Middle Ages?"

706
01:10:41,053 --> 01:10:43,138
Yes, we did, sir Zimosa.

707
01:10:43,151 --> 01:10:45,584
You can not even imagine
how many things...

708
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:48,517
And the type of technology
that I can costearme.

709
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,800
It's something your head idiot
can not even imagine.

710
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:53,045
Anyway...

711
01:10:53,214 --> 01:10:55,324
As I said,
I have many buildings.

712
01:10:55,415 --> 01:11:00,315
Unfortunately, I have one in
the shitty town called Chicago.
