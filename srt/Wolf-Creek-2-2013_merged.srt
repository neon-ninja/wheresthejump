1
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,773
Shit. It's under.

2
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,981
He doesn't know that.

3
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,910
Yes!

4
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,466
Oh, yeah.

5
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,240
G'day.

6
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,581
Get out of the vehicle.

7
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,671
No worries.

8
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,643
Know how fast you were going?

9
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,396
Faster than I was supposed to,
if you blokes pulled me up.

10
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,556
You shoot pigs for a living?

11
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,192
Bet your life.

12
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,230
Can you read?

13
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,617
Well, get a bit stuck on the big words
every now and then, but you know.

14
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,782
Yeah, I can read pretty good.

15
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,246
Then you'd be able to
read the sign back there

16
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,326
with the big one-fuckin'-double-zero
on it, wouldn't you?

17
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:57,957
You know, I could've sworn I was, you
know, sittin' under 100 there. You know.

18
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,843
You think I'm talking shit?

19
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,761
Struth no. No, sorry, mate. No.

20
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,100
No, look, won't happen
again, all right?

21
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,439
Where the fuck you
think you're going?

22
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,280
You bastards. You're
putting me on, aren't you?

23
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,282
You're not really going
to book me, are you?

24
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,412
Can I see your license, please?

25
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,762
You're a long way
from home, aren't ya?

26
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:55,312
Look, always travel up north when I'm
doing a bit of hunting, you know.

27
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:59,063
Get away from it all. Not
a lot of pigs down south.

28
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,937
Ooh!

29
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,030
This, plus a speeding ticket.

30
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,991
It's an order to take
this car off the road

31
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,947
for good.

32
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,876
Tires are as bald as a baby's ass.

33
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,624
Amazed it's even running.

34
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,131
Body looks like you've thrown
it off a fuckin' cliff!

35
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,333
Aw...

36
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,503
Come on.

37
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,886
Now you take this piece
of shit back to town,

38
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,851
and then you get the fuck
back where you came from.

39
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,144
I don't want to see your ugly
mug around here ever again.

40
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,518
You understand?

41
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,816
Or is that too many
big words for you?

42
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,288
Mate, you sure you
want to give me this?

43
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,411
Bet your life.

44
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,841
You have a nice day.

45
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,502
Ta!

46
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,377
You fuckin' asshole. Oh, man.

47
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,545
That's how we keep our
quotas up out here, son.

48
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,419
Oh, man. "You sure you
want to give me this?"

49
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,677
Yeah. Pretty sure you just got that rusted
piece of shit taken off the road, too.

50
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,886
Fuckin' dickhead.

51
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,761
Oh, man, did you see
the look on his face?

52
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What a redneck moron.

53
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,651
Jesus! Fuck! Fuck!

54
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,148
Fuck, the...

55
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,440
Fuck!

56
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,821
Shot!

57
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,308
Where the bloody hell do
you think you're going?

58
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,393
You're crazy, mate!

59
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,812
Not me leg. I think it's broken.

60
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,484
Yeah.

61
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,115
Ah, shut up, you big crybaby.

62
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,374
That'll do, pig.

63
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,997
What do you think
you're fuckin' doing?

64
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,174
You know, your little mate's right.

65
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,968
I am a pig shooter.

66
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,797
You know what I do to pigs
who won't stop squealing?

67
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,810
I make 'em stop!

68
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,860
Fuck me.

69
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,246
You stupid pair of bastards.

70
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:27,247
Look at the fuckin' mess you made,
huh? Now, I gotta clean it up.

71
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,380
They'll fuckin' find us!

72
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,004
They'll find the fuckin'
car and then they'll...

73
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,216
Fuck.

74
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,111
I want to see my kids.

75
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,943
Why?

76
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,450
Mate... Mate, wait.

77
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,752
I can make the ticket
go away, mate.

78
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,458
Or I can make you go away.

79
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,041
Let's go! You are seriously a hero.

80
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,105
Hello.

81
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,246
Cool.

82
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:49,692
Hey! Thank you! Thank you!

83
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,761
Have a good trip.

84
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,467
Awesome.

85
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,646
They are so cute. I love them.

86
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,848
What are they called again?

87
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,313
The little black one's
called Nutella.

88
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,484
Yeah, we have that in Europe, too.

89
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:53,030
I know it's brown, but it's my
little daughter's idea of a joke.

90
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,074
And the little one with the
broken horn is called Casper.

91
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,869
And, uh, the other
one, that's Marley.

92
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,489
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

93
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,620
- It's all right.
- Here we are.

94
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,873
Bye-bye, kids.

95
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,580
- Thank you. Auf Wiedersehen.
- See ya. Okay.

96
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,053
- See ya, love.
- Thank you very much.

97
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,008
So cool.

98
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,821
Oops.

99
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,665
Hello, and, uh, goodbye.

100
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,634
All right, if you keep fighting
you're gonna go back to the car.

101
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,440
Motherfucker!

102
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,434
What's wrong with you people?
You afraid to stop or something?

103
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,312
Yahtzee.

104
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,238
What the bloody hell are you
buggers doing out here?

105
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,244
This is a national park.
You can't camp here, mate.

106
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,077
Uh...

107
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:09,083
Sorry, we did not know that was the
case. About national parks, I mean.

108
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,918
No signs here.

109
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,056
Oh, well, don't get your knickers in a knot,
mate, I'm not a ranger or anything. Eh?

110
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,600
Look at this bloody fire, mate.
You haven't put it out properly.

111
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:23,021
All this bloody saltbush around
here is dry as a nun's nasty.

112
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,645
You know, one spark, the whole
bloody place will go up!

113
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,191
Ah. I...

114
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,985
I did put some water on it.

115
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,479
Yeah?

116
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:34,317
Well, for all the good you've done,
you may as well have pissed on it, eh?

117
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,615
It was a good thing
I found you, huh?

118
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,454
Name's Mick.

119
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,822
Rutger.

120
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,867
Rutger. Rutger! Eh?

121
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,827
Kraut, are ya?

122
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,212
I'm, um... From Germany.

123
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,256
They usually are.

124
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,628
Okay.

125
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,171
Oh...

126
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,425
Heil, Fräulein.

127
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,926
Hi.

128
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,513
Little bit of German for you.

129
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,515
It's good, Fräulein.

130
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,939
As I was saying, mate, if
the rangers did find you,

131
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,192
you'd be charged, right?
You wouldn't want that, would you?

132
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,573
No.

133
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,992
As a matter of fact, mate,
I'm going back through town,

134
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,036
so I can give you a lift, okay?

135
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:23,248
You know, and set you up in a
caravan park for the night.

136
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,833
Right? Yeah?

137
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,787
You wouldn't want to be hiking
back into town, would you?

138
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,462
No, we were hoping to
get lift tomorrow.

139
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:37,301
Like I said, there's no signs here, so did
not think we were doing anything wrong.

140
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,224
Well, I'm offering you a
lift, mate, you know.

141
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,802
So you won't get caught.

142
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,852
Um...

143
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,727
Are you sure there's no camping
here? I checked on the map.

144
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,062
I just said so, didn't I?

145
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,449
Well, yes, but...

146
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,700
Well, you calling me a liar?

147
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,664
Um...

148
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:09,462
Look, I'm gonna give you one
last chance to help you out.

149
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,912
All right?

150
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,430
Thank you, but, um, we will stay.

151
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,305
Sorry about the fire and for
making you come out of your way.

152
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,475
Don't you turn your back
on me, you Nazi bastard!

153
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,901
So, let me hear you talk
back now, you dopey cunt.

154
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,620
Rutger!

155
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,197
Rutger!

156
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,115
Rutger!

157
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,451
Rutger!

158
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,417
Let me go!

159
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,123
Let me go!

160
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,093
Eh?

161
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:12,558
Keep still. Keep still.
Keep fucking still!

162
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,026
Now put your hands together.

163
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:21,234
Put your fucking hands together, or I'll
spread your nose all over your face.

164
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,402
Huh?

165
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,863
Now look, I didn't
want to do you here,

166
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:30,834
but your stupid fucking
boyfriend forced me.

167
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,916
And now, why wait, eh?

168
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,548
Anyways, my name's Mick Taylor.

169
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,684
Pleased to meet you.

170
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,263
You know...

171
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,810
I still don't know what you friggin'
tourists see in this place.

172
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:01,364
I mean, is this the way you
spend your life, Fräulein?

173
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,566
Eh?

174
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,870
Coming out here and
shitting in our backyard?

175
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,990
Is that what it's all about, eh?

176
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,999
Is it, eh?

177
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,201
I'm talking to you.

178
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:14,829
Talking to you!

179
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,420
Oh...

180
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,210
Oh, look at that, eh?

181
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,980
Cookies!

182
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,110
Rutger!

183
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,085
Rutger!

184
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,588
Rutger, no!

185
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,440
Eh?

186
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,670
Shit!

187
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,131
He's tougher than a pig.

188
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,384
Where you crawling
off to, Fräulein?

189
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,191
Now,

190
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,023
I promise you.

191
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:10,495
We're gonna spend a nice,
long, few months together.

192
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,263
There we go!

193
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,551
Non-smoker.

194
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,889
Gutless Kraut now, huh?

195
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,602
Jesus!

196
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,402
Rutger, what are you,
part bloody donkey?

197
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,159
Who's the lucky girl, then? That'd
make your eyes water, wouldn't it?

198
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,410
Here's a little piggy,
here's his snout.

199
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,500
Slit him open and
his guts fail out.

200
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,751
Get your fucking head out of there.

201
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,429
All good.

202
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,927
The dogs'll like that.

203
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,593
Oh, you mongrel bastard.

204
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,147
Oh, Jesus.

205
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,187
Come on!

206
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,476
Come on.

207
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:11,110
Quickest way to a man's heart
is through his chest, eh?

208
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,910
Doesn't look fucking easy getting through
that fucking breastplate, does it?

209
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,906
Can you fucking believe it?
There we are.

210
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,248
Oh, no. Rip your heart out.

211
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,371
There we go!

212
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,826
Hide and seek, is it?

213
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,982
Hey, come on, girly.

214
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,852
Up the ass.

215
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,990
Wait, wait.

216
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,750
You have to run faster than that.

217
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,381
Clever bitch, eh?

218
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,354
Beck?

219
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,063
Becky?

220
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,561
Hello, Angel?

221
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,941
I can't hear you, babe.

222
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,697
Um...

223
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,899
Becky.

224
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Bollocks.

225
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,879
Holy shit!

226
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,300
Help me!

227
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,129
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

228
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,260
What happened?

229
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,757
Did you get hit?

230
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,476
What?

231
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:30,158
It's all right. Come on! We're gonna
get you out of here, all right?

232
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,559
All right.

233
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,019
Whoa.

234
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,072
Hey, is there anyone else?
Is there anyone...

235
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,242
Who did this shit to you?

236
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,036
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on!

237
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,121
Give me your hand, all right?

238
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,331
I don't understand you!

239
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,089
Who's this fucking maggot?

240
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,850
Who was that? Who was that?

241
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,691
What the fuck is going on here?

242
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,691
You'll have to do better
than that, asshole!

243
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,050
Oh, shit! It's all right!

244
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:28,098
Hey, little pigs, little pigs!
Let me come in!

245
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,851
It's all right!

246
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,935
Come on, you fucker!

247
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,940
Whoa!

248
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,116
Fuck! Fuck!

249
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,631
Hold on!

250
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,059
Oh, God!

251
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,082
It's all right.
Hang on. It's all right.

252
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,300
See you in hell, cunt!

253
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,170
Jesus.

254
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,929
Yeah!

255
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,473
Oh, shit!

256
00:39:58,688 --> 00:39:59,889
Are you all right?

257
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,064
Oh, shit!

258
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,258
Fuck!

259
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,052
For fuck's sake, Mick!

260
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,481
Don't!

261
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,249
Fuck!

262
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:20,965
I'm...

263
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,390
I'm sorry.

264
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,494
Shit!

265
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:59,169
Shit, shit, shit!

266
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,084
Uh...

267
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,142
Hey!

268
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,940
Oh, shit!

269
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:37,037
What the fuck's wrong
with you, you pricks?

270
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:40,248
Stop, you fucking bastards!

271
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,677
Okay.

272
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,102
Okay.

273
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,710
Hey!

274
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:28,963
Hey!

275
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,132
Stop!

276
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,971
Here! Hey!

277
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,910
Oh, fuck me.

278
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,037
Oh, shit!

279
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,814
Thanks for the truck, blubber guts.

280
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,277
Let's play, eh?

281
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,988
Come on!

282
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,154
Oh, shit!

283
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,951
Whoops.

284
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:32,920
Bit of music, eh?

285
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:11,000
Oh, shit!

286
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:18,799
Oh, shit!

287
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:24,897
Hey! Shit! Flying kangaroo!

288
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,110
Oh! Sorry, Skippy.

289
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,778
Hey!

290
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,792
Welcome to Australia, cocksucker.

291
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,175
Come on.

292
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,538
Oh!

293
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,773
Come on!

294
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,421
Shit!

295
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,684
You'll have to do better than that!

296
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,949
He's got to be hungry, I know that.

297
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,782
We didn't know whether to wake you.

298
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:09,325
We're heading to town as soon
as you've eaten something.

299
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:17,590
Phone?

300
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,675
No phones.

301
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,753
We got shortwave if it was working.

302
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:26,307
It's the magnets. Something
weird in the ground.

303
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:29,603
Even the TV goes on the
blink now and again.

304
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,226
Ah, you got to be
self-sufficient out here.

305
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,313
It's all right.

306
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,026
You're safe now.

307
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,715
I'm Lil.

308
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:43,919
This is Jack.

309
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,884
Paul.

310
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:56,060
Come on, son. Eat up.
You'll need your strength.

311
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:20,126
I made it special for you.

312
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:29,423
You in there, hero?

313
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,178
You don't want anyone else
to get hurt, do you, eh?

314
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,227
He's here.

315
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,740
Don't you worry, mate.
I'll see to it.

316
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,474
Get off my property.

317
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:20,144
Hey, mate. The boy. Hand him over.

318
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,279
I said get the hell away from here.

319
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,780
Now get.

320
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,225
He's gone.

321
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,394
No. No, he's...

322
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:01,018
He's not.

323
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:04,146
He will be if I see him again.

324
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,277
The car's at the front.

325
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,446
We'll all go out together.

326
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:11,028
You got the keys, no?

327
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,358
I can't.

328
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,960
Shit.

329
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,682
Hey, baby.

330
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:21,432
We could have had a
good time, you and me.

331
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,653
Please!

332
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:00,981
Just leave me alone.

333
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,866
Fucking Pommy, eh?

334
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,319
I...

335
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:11,828
- Huh. Definitely a Pommy.
- Weak as piss.

336
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:25,607
Obviously don't know the
first rule of the Outback, hero.

337
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:31,037
You never, ever stop.

338
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:36,417
Could have saved yourself
a whole lot of trouble.

339
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:44,583
Why you here, Pommy?

340
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,757
Please...

341
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,686
I asked you a question.

342
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:58,765
- Why are you here?
- Please...

343
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,059
Please... I didn't...

344
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:05,316
I didn't mean to interfere.

345
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:10,409
I should have just left her there
and minded my own business.

346
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:14,990
Well, maybe I can
answer it for you, huh?

347
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:17,701
You're here for an adventure.

348
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,461
You're here for a bit
of excitement, hmm?

349
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:26,174
- For the thrill, hey? Hey?
- Yes. Yes! Yes!

350
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,634
- Something a bit different!
- Please.

351
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:31,465
Please!
Just let me out of here.

352
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:34,429
And I'll just walk away.

353
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,518
That's a good one.

354
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:40,105
You expect to come to
my fucking country,

355
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:43,275
waltz around like you
own the bloody place,

356
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:47,445
come between a man and his
meal and "just walk away," eh?

357
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:48,864
Just like that?

358
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,488
Please! Don't!

359
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,789
You owe me, boy.

360
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:00,292
What made you think you could
just take her away from me, huh?

361
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:01,960
Just wanted to...

362
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,837
Hey? Hey, hey, hey?

363
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:07,508
Where's your famous
English wit, now? Huh?

364
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:12,971
Even harder to be a smartass
with no fucking tongue.

365
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:16,679
There once was a lad from York,

366
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,852
who picked his nose with a fork.

367
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:21,646
And when it got stuck, he
cried, "I don't give a fuck,"

368
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:24,600
and walked around
looking like a dork.

369
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:29,613
There once was a man,
uh, from Kansas,

370
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:32,157
whose nuts were made of brass.

371
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:35,908
In stormy weather, he'd clack them together,
and lightning would shoot out his ass.

372
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:40,074
What are you doing, Pom? Hmm?

373
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,669
There once was an old lady from
Wheeling, who had a peculiar feeling.

374
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:48,465
And she lied on her back,
and tickled her crack,

375
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:50,880
and pissed all over the ceiling.

376
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:57,557
"Pissed all over the ceiling."

377
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,643
You're a funny little
fuck, aren't ya, eh?

378
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:02,063
English wit, mate.

379
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:04,228
Where'd you learn those?

380
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,062
Boarding school.

381
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:07,859
Boarding school, huh?

382
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,861
Pants-down, botty-whackers, eh?

383
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,565
Only on weekends.

384
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:16,201
You still know fuck
all about my country,

385
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,700
eh, you little Pommy ponce?

386
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:22,166
There once was an
Australian stockman,

387
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:25,412
lying, dying.

388
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,756
And he got up on one elbow

389
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:34,053
and he turned to his mates who had
all gathered around and he said...

390
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:37,382
<i>Watch me Wallabies feed, mate</i>

391
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:40,096
<i>Watch me Wallabies feed</i>

392
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:42,560
<i>They're a dangerous breed, mate</i>

393
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:43,978
<i>So watch me Wallabies feed</i>

394
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,105
<i>All together now!</i>

395
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,649
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

396
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,773
<i>Tie me kangaroo down</i>

397
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,445
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

398
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,273
<i>Tie me kangaroo down</i>

399
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:57,075
<i>Keep me cockatoo cool, Curl</i>

400
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:58,994
<i>Keep me cockatoo cool</i>

401
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,746
<i>Don't go acting a fool, Curl</i>

402
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:04,374
<i>Just keep me cockatoo cool
All together now!</i>

403
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:06,577
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

404
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:08,587
<i>Tie me kangaroo down</i>

405
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:11,589
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

406
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,337
<i>Tie me kangaroo down</i>

407
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:16,094
<i>Take me koala back, Jack</i>

408
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,887
<i>Take me koala back</i>

409
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,265
<i>He lives somewhere out
on the track, Mac</i>

410
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:21,933
<i>So take me koala back</i>

411
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,184
<i>All together now!</i>

412
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,228
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

413
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:27,181
<i>Tie me kangaroo down</i>

414
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,816
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

415
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:31,815
<i>Tie me kangaroo down</i>

416
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,571
<i>Play your didgeridoo, Blue</i>

417
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:36,322
<i>Play your didgeridoo</i>

418
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:38,950
<i>Keep playing 'til I
shoot through, Blue</i>

419
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,285
<i>Play your didgeridoo</i>

420
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:41,829
<i>All together...</i>

421
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:48,294
<i>Tan me hide when I'm dead, Fred</i>

422
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:52,173
<i>Tan me hide when I'm dead</i>

423
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:55,633
<i>So we tanned his hide
when he died, Clyde</i>

424
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,802
<i>And that's it hanging on the shed!
Hey!</i>

425
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:05,019
Fuck me.

426
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:10,353
You mad little British bastard.

427
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:12,025
Well, you know...

428
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:14,027
Where do you know that song from?

429
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:16,151
Uh... My mother had the record.

430
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:18,820
- Oh.
- We'd listen to it endlessly as kids.

431
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,661
My word, eh?

432
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:27,204
You are a knowledgeable
little prick, eh?

433
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,136
I'll tell you what, mate.

434
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:43,556
Let's have a fucking drink, eh?

435
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:47,435
I thought you'd never
fucking ask, mate.

436
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:50,230
"I thought you'd
never fucking ask."

437
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:23,429
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down

438
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:29,238
There you are, son. Let's wrap the
laughing gear around this one, eh?

439
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:31,935
Oh. Thanks. It'd be better
to have a free hand.

440
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:35,522
Oh. Thanks for mentioning that.
I would never have thought. You know.

441
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:36,894
There we go.

442
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:40,731
- Thank you.
- Okay.

443
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,957
- Get that up, son.
- Thank you.

444
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,375
Please.

445
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,209
Here's looking up ya bum.

446
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:06,469
Whoo...

447
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:08,099
All right, isn't it?

448
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,769
Tastes like camel's piss but, Jesus,
it gives a man a fuckin' buzz.

449
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,564
Rum. It's all me and my mates
used to drink back home.

450
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:16,816
Yeah? Rum, eh? Here's a good one.

451
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:19,944
<i>My name is old Jack Palmer
I once dug for gold</i>

452
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:22,697
<i>The song I'm 'bout to sing ya
Recalls the days of old</i>

453
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,450
<i>When I'd plenty mates around me
and the mates would fairly hum</i>

454
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:28,655
<i>As we all sat together
round the old keg of rum</i>

455
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:32,123
<i>The old keg of rum,
the old keg of rum</i>

456
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:35,794
<i>As we all sat together
round the old keg of rum</i>

457
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:38,501
<i>The old keg of rum...</i>

458
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:44,838
<i>Australians all, let us rejoice</i>

459
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:50,051
<i>For we are young and free</i>

460
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:55,978
<i>With golden soil and
wealth for toil</i>

461
01:18:56,148 --> 01:19:00,228
<i>Our home is girt by sea</i>

462
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:05,240
I hate that fucking song.

463
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,866
"Girt by sea."

464
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:07,951
Who's "Gert"?

465
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:10,119
Some fucking big butch lesbian

466
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,580
standing astride Sydney
fucking heads or something.

467
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,203
It's a fucking shit song.

468
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,203
Hmm...

469
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:19,747
Oh, shit.

470
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:31,639
Now, seeing as you're such an amusing
fucking Einstein know-it-all bastard,

471
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,310
I got this little game
we can play, huh?

472
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:36,396
- Kind of like a quiz. Yeah.
- Right.

473
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:40,149
I call it Aussie history.

474
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:44,862
I ask you 10 questions, you get
half of 'em right, so, five,

475
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:46,572
and then I'll let you go.

476
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,525
Does that sound all right to you?

477
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:53,997
That's... That sounds
fucking brilliant.

478
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:55,541
Really?

479
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,581
Sorry. I didn't get
your name, mate.

480
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,587
Ah. Mick Taylor's the name.

481
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:03,965
Pig-shooter and general
fuckin' Outback legend.

482
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:05,883
Right. Cheers.

483
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,928
- You ready to rock 'n' roll?
- Yeah.

484
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:20,144
What's that for, Mick?

485
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:22,351
Oh, I forgot to mention.

486
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:28,115
For each one that you get wrong,
I get to grind off a finger.

487
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:35,331
So, 10 questions, 10 fingers. Kind
of fitting, you know what I mean?

488
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:36,957
Of course.

489
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,587
So it's sort of like Who
Wants To Be a Millionaire?

490
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:43,796
Yeah!

491
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:46,424
Except you don't get to phone
a friend if you get one wrong

492
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:50,220
because you'll be too busy
screaming in fucking agony.

493
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,303
All right.

494
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,355
Let's rock 'n' roll then.

495
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,484
All right. We'll start
off with an easy one.

496
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:09,031
What Aboriginal term
meaning "waterhole"

497
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:13,824
is also the name of an Australian
surf clothing company?

498
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:24,663
Billabong.

499
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,499
Very good.

500
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,009
- Next one's a bit harder.
- Right.

501
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:32,212
But you're a stinkin' Pom,
so you'll be all right.

502
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:38,019
In what year did the British
settle in Australia?

503
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:45,267
Oh, um...

504
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:53,574
After Lieutenant James Cook
discovered the east coast

505
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:56,028
and mapped it in 1770,

506
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:00,032
the First Fleet arrived
and settled on

507
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:04,545
26th of January, 1788.

508
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,716
Does that answer your question?

509
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:13,553
Jesus! You are a smart cunt.

510
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:17,266
I might have to let you
go on that answer alone.

511
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:21,310
Where'd you learn all that shit?

512
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:22,763
I'm majoring in history.

513
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:26,225
Majoring in history? That's a
fucking coincidence, isn't it, eh?

514
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:31,904
But I am a man of my word,
and either way, you know,

515
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:34,984
I did say 10...

516
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:36,985
Here we go.

517
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,912
Okay.

518
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:48,334
Mmm.

519
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:51,007
Rightio.

520
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:57,966
In what year did the British start
deporting convicts to Australia?

521
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:03,060
The first 11 ships of the First
Fleet arrived with their cargo

522
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:07,482
of around 780 British convicts
in Botany Bay, New South Wales.

523
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:13,106
And a further two convict fleets
arrived in 1790 and 1791.

524
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:18,243
The first free settlers
arrived in 1793.

525
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:21,621
Mick?

526
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:24,624
Mick?

527
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:26,452
That's right. Isn't it?

528
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:28,329
I know it is.

529
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:31,711
Why?

530
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,377
Um...

531
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:40,716
I'm not really sure I
understand the question.

532
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:47,189
Why did the British deport
convicts to Australia?

533
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,191
Why? Um...

534
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:52,811
Uh...

535
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:57,114
Come on, you dumb fuck.

536
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:58,741
Time waits for no man.

537
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:01,661
- No, no, no!
- Tick, took, tick, took, tick...

538
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:04,163
First, first... First of all,

539
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,791
after the British
lost the 13 colonies

540
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:10,127
they'd lost their penal settlements
in Virginia, in the United States.

541
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:13,172
And they needed somewhere
to put all the criminals

542
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:14,465
that were stacking up in England.

543
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:16,676
There were... There were just
too many of these people,

544
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:20,096
and they were just spreading
disease and wasting resources.

545
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:22,391
And, second of all, they...

546
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:25,685
And just, Australia looked
to be as rich in resources

547
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:26,936
as the Americas.

548
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:29,936
And obviously the British wanted to
settle this before the French did.

549
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:32,317
Or the Dutch.

550
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,353
Something like that?

551
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:38,406
Mick, no. What the fuck,
man? That's right!

552
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:42,202
What are you doing? Mick! Fuck!
That's the right fucking answer!

553
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:44,696
What do you want me to fucking...

554
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:47,158
Fuck! Mick, that's right!

555
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:50,042
Fuck! That's the right
fucking answer, Mick!

556
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:53,497
Mick! Jesus Christ! No!
I got two. Come on!

557
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:56,299
You don't need to fucking do this!
I got them all right.

558
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,798
It's the right fucking answer!

559
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,944
It was fucking right!

560
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:20,031
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was the right fucking...

561
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:21,575
No, it wasn't.

562
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:25,161
The right answer is

563
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:30,666
because they are a
pack of Pommy cunts.

564
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:40,419
No, seriously, you're right,
you know, technically.

565
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:45,424
And that gives me the shits.

566
01:25:51,897 --> 01:25:54,646
Come on. Calm down. Calm down.

567
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,443
Jesus Christ, you're going
on like a big girl.

568
01:25:57,444 --> 01:25:58,941
It fucking hurt.

569
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:02,733
Knock those tears off. Knock
'em off, you bloody suck.

570
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,871
- You all right?
- Yeah.

571
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:12,793
Jesus H. Christ, boy.
You all right? You all right?

572
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,418
Yeah.

573
01:26:15,253 --> 01:26:17,581
Right? All right?

574
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,711
All right.

575
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:28,307
Just one more quick one. An easy one
and then I'll get us another drink.

576
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:30,431
And you can be on your way. Eh?

577
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:34,807
You're doing real well, mate.
You're doing real well.

578
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:39,770
Cheers.

579
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:49,325
Now, who's Australia's
most famous cricketer?

580
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:52,366
And not Shane fucking Warne.

581
01:26:57,003 --> 01:26:58,204
Come on.

582
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:08,305
Come on.

583
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:13,804
I don't know anything
about fucking cricket.

584
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:17,436
Can you ask me a football question?

585
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:21,152
You don't have to know about
cricket to know who this bloke is.

586
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:22,987
Just give me a clue.

587
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:25,698
Well, he's the greatest
cricketer of all time.

588
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:28,159
The Muhammad Ali of
fucking cricket!

589
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,408
Oh, shit. Come on, Paul.

590
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:32,538
It's on the tip of
my fucking tongue!

591
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:35,708
Yeah, well, look. This will be on the
tip of your bloody tongue in a minute!

592
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:38,335
What kind of a bloody
idiot you take me for?

593
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:40,709
What letter does it
fucking start with?

594
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:42,506
"D."

595
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:45,711
D... D... D...

596
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:48,927
- Douglas Jardine.
- Fucking Pommy, you idiot.

597
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,686
Dennis... Dennis Lillee.

598
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:56,854
Not fucking Dennis Lillee.

599
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:58,689
- It's Dennis fucking Lillee.
- It's not Dennis Lillee.

600
01:27:58,690 --> 01:27:59,940
A famous cricketer
that starts with "D."

601
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:03,190
It's not fucking
Dennis fucking Lillee.

602
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:06,113
What the fuck is it
then if it's not...

603
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,316
Fuck this! Fuck you!

604
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:11,410
No, no, no! Please! Please!
Jesus Christ, the other hand!

605
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:13,954
- Eh?
- Use the fucking other hand, Mick!

606
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:16,999
Is that your wanking hand, is it?

607
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:19,335
Please yourself.

608
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:21,914
Mick, it's Dennis fucking Lillee!

609
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:24,548
Dennis fucking Lillee! Please!

610
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:28,253
Please! Please! Mick! Mick! Mick!

611
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:30,422
It's Dennis Lillee...

612
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,181
Give me that fucking hand

613
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:36,432
or I'll knock your fucking teeth
right down your fucking throat.

614
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,563
You understand me? Eh? Eh?

615
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,234
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

616
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:53,361
Oh, no!

617
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:32,112
Please.

618
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:35,036
Just let me out of here.

619
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:36,912
Of course I am going to let
you out of there, mate.

620
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:39,161
You've been a real good sport.

621
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:43,294
But first I'm going to grab
us another drink. All right?

622
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:23,000
You're going to let me go now?

623
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:24,710
Yeah, of course I will.

624
01:30:24,711 --> 01:30:27,414
Yeah, I'm going to
let you out of here

625
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:29,924
and then I'm going to
take you somewhere else.

626
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,378
- Down there.
- No!

627
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:37,341
'Cause you see, no one
really gets out of here.

628
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:40,386
Well, not in one piece, you know.

629
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:44,055
Figuratively speaking.

630
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:57,868
That would just be crazy.

631
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,447
What the fuck is this?

632
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:06,710
You said you were a
man of your word.

633
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:08,413
I am. I am, mate.

634
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:13,585
As I said, you owe me, boy.

635
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:16,553
You took away my plaything.

636
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:21,058
And so, you're just going to
have to stand in for a bit.

637
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:22,761
Okey dokey?

638
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:27,853
No. You're some
fucking faggot freak.

639
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:29,233
You...

640
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:32,403
Don't you ever fucking say that!

641
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:35,072
Don't you ever say that!

642
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:36,320
Hey!

643
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:40,744
This will turn you into a woman.

644
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:45,291
I didn't mean it like that.

645
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:50,296
Hey, Mick.

646
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,011
It's Don Bradman, bitch.

647
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,108
You'll have to do better than that,

648
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:14,229
you Pommy cunt!

649
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:36,168
Oi! That really bloody hurt!

650
01:32:36,426 --> 01:32:38,128
I think you cracked me skull!

651
01:32:38,511 --> 01:32:41,889
I got claret coming out of me
bloody skull, all over the place!

652
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:43,432
There's blood everywhere!

653
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:46,011
I hope you're happy
with yourself, mate!

654
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:05,288
Yeah, I reckon by now you ought
to have found the dead end.

655
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:09,163
People have been dying
to get out of here.

656
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:15,631
Fuck!

657
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:20,636
<i>Oh, Danny boy</i>

658
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:25,346
<i>The pipes, the pipes are calling</i>

659
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,845
<i>From glen to glen</i>

660
01:33:29,229 --> 01:33:31,352
<i>And down the mountain side</i>

661
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:36,566
<i>The summer's gone and
all the flowers are dying</i>

662
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:43,367
You've got to be fucking joking.

663
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Here comes Uncle Mick!

664
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:10,053
Make it stop! Please!

665
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,768
Please, don't leave me!

666
01:34:13,231 --> 01:34:15,354
I'll come back! I'll come back!

667
01:34:16,025 --> 01:34:17,522
Please!

668
01:34:18,945 --> 01:34:21,694
Help me!

669
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:21,166
Now, about all them bodies.

670
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:23,627
They deserved it.

671
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:25,302
All of 'em.

672
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:27,130
Foreign bastards!

673
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:32,226
Noxious, bloody weak.

674
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:46,858
Somebody's gotta keep
Australia beautiful!

675
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:50,695
Fuck!

676
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:00,504
We're having such a good time.

677
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:04,551
Singing, and drinking,
and carrying on.

678
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,843
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

679
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:09,429
<i>Tie me kangaroo down
Tie me...</i>

680
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:11,382
Ah, fuck ya!

681
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:13,767
Come on! Come on!

682
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:17,973
Get out of here! Get him! Go on,
get away up there. Get on him!

683
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,081
No!

684
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:01,398
Come on, mate. Where do
you think you're going?

685
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:04,944
I told ya, there's
no way out of here.

686
01:37:28,176 --> 01:37:30,970
Fee-fi-fo-fum

687
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:34,928
I smell the blood
of a stinkin' Porn!

688
01:38:07,507 --> 01:38:08,754
Bit rough, ain't it?

689
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:15,090
Now, where were we?

690
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:18,847
Yeah, that's right.

691
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:22,806
You see, in this world,

692
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:27,318
there's people like me and
there's people like you.

693
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:32,531
And people like me eat people
like you for breakfast

694
01:38:32,532 --> 01:38:34,450
and shit 'em out.

695
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:39,785
You're nothing but foreign vermin.

696
01:38:40,289 --> 01:38:43,743
A stinking introduced species.

697
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:48,381
And it's up to my kind
to wipe your kind out.

698
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:54,178
And that makes me the winner.

699
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:56,801
Which makes you...

700
01:40:09,462 --> 01:40:10,879
You got to help me.

701
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:12,998
You got to help me.
