1
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,520
Are... you the... Are you the demon Lo?

2
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,850
Yeah.

3
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,600
Have... great power?

4
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,450
This... I know...

5
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,850
This I know.

6
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,600
Now clean the shit from your pants and tell me what you want.

7
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,980
A girl.

8
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,770
You summoned me for <i>love</i>?

9
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,020
Yes.

10
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:29,730
You would throw away my great power over such human trivialities?

11
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,340
You have to do what I say.

12
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,490
Look at you, pretending to be brave.

13
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,140
What's your name?

14
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:41,880
Justin.

15
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,670
That's a terrible name.

16
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,840
Doesn't fit your future. Allow me to baptize you...

17
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,550
"Dinner"

18
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,640
It's Justin.

19
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,840
Dinner!

20
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,620
You have to let go of the past.

21
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,880
I summoned you...

22
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,740
You have to obey my charge.

23
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,700
That might be loosely true, but I'm under no obligation to respect you.

24
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,420
And if given the opportunity, I will eat you.

25
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,060
I'm not afraid.

26
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,540
You are...

27
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,280
Where the fuck am I?

28
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,420
In my apartment.

29
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,580
Dramatic! You mind if I make a few... changes?

30
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,090
Now where would a stringy pork-chop like you get such an old goat?

31
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,800
It's not mine.

32
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,800
Really?

33
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,140
I would've pegged you as a "class A" warlock.

34
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,740
Belonged to her.

35
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,900
Pretty.

36
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,880
Not her best angle.

37
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,660
Do you know her?

38
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,540
No.

39
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,040
You're lying!

40
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,440
I warn you, Dinner.

41
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,380
Trying to read a demon is a thorny game.

42
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,340
You took her...

43
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,470
<i>I</i> took her?

44
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,120
Not you specifically, but your... people.

45
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,730
Oh.... I knew it!

46
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,540
You're racist.

47
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,850
She was taken by some<i>thing</i>.

48
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,920
A- A demon!

49
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,490
You sure it wasn't a bear?

50
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,130
I hear they're getting braver these days.

51
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,640
I'm not an idiot.

52
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,480
Okay? I might just be a bug to you, but I'm not a fool, okay?

53
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,680
She was taken by something, something like you.

54
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,120
I thought I was dying. It took April!

55
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,770
"It took April". Look!

56
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,900
Let me give you a nugget of advice.

57
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,450
Page 303. It's a closing spell.

58
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,820
Send me away before I get <i>really</i> hungry.

59
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,140
I'm not leaving here without her.

60
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,920
Look, Dinner.

61
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,910
If what you're telling me is true, and I'm <i>sure </i>it is.

62
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,050
The simple fact is: you're fucked.

63
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,630
You don't get out of Hell, that's it.

64
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,920
I want to see her.

65
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,770
Well, I don't know her.

66
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,340
Her name is Apr-

67
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,420
Yes! She's the rain that brings the flowers.
Her name is Apr-

68
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,060
Yes! She's the rain that brings the flowers.

69
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,080
Look, I'm sure you two had a <i>deeply emotional connection</i>.
Yes! She's the rain that brings the flowers.

70
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,730
Look, I'm sure you two had a <i>deeply emotional connection</i>.

71
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,180
But the simple fact is: Hell is a big place.

72
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,780
Kinda gloomy,...

73
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,000
... endless amount of souls. Been around since, I don't know,<i> </i><i>the Dawn of Men</i>.

74
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,650
We don't keep records.

75
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,980
Then I'll wait.

76
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,860
What? No.

77
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,640
What?

78
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,580
While you look for her.

79
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,950
No, no. I'm busy.

80
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,620
I'm yourMaster.

81
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,780
Demon, I'm yourMaster!

82
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,260
What you're asking is impossible!

83
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,420
But I'm still asking.

84
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,050
Frightened children shouldn't play with pentagrams.

85
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,600
If you so much as let a pinky outside of that circle, I will have you in my belly for 90 years.

86
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,250
That's how long it takes my acids to break down a little bitch like you.

87
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,520
<i>Why me?</i>

88
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,380
April!

89
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,240
April Oak.

90
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,450
Like the tree?

91
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:53,860
Yes.

92
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,670
Stupid name for a human.

93
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,180
Tell me about her.

94
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,220
Just find her for me!

95
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,910
That's what I'm trying to do!

96
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,520
But the better versed I am in your Juliet

97
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,040
the better chance I have of finding her out of the billions of dark matter

98
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,100
floating around in torment.

99
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,260
<i>Oh.</i>

100
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,620
Yes... "Oh".

101
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,850
What do you wanna know?

102
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,100
I want details. Emotional ones.

103
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,520
I want to feel your pain for her.

104
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,620
Well...

105
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,500
She's... She's 5'3...

106
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,560
Brown hair...

107
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,180
Stop!

108
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,180
Goddamn, Dinner. You <i>are</i> stupid.

109
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,520
I asked you for <i>emotional details</i>.

110
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:43,200
How you met, how you fought, how you fucked, how you kissed, how you ate,

111
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,360
date, hit, and shout at God!

112
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,750
Don't give me her stats, I'm not casting a movie.

113
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,780
So... you want... details...

114
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,560
Yes!

115
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,620
Like, how me first met?

116
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,540
Yes!

117
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,030
"The Sound of Music" said it best.

118
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,990
Well, I was on lunch break at a restaurant I go.

119
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,080
<i>What?</i>

120
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,160
It's flashback time!

121
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,160
That's me?

122
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,600
No, that's me pulling the thoughts from your brain and projecting them on that wall over there.

123
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,840
I know, right?

124
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,900
Now hush. Let's just see what happens.

125
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,780
Hi!

126
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,580
Hi.

127
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,650
Is that good?

128
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,100
Yeah, it's okay.

129
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,380
Can I try it?

130
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,600
Your silence says "no"...

131
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,930
No! You can.

132
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,560
Do you... want a bite?

133
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,480
Yeah, I would!

134
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,420
Shit! It's good!

135
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,300
So good...

136
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,060
Would you like one?

137
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,800
Yes.

138
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,330
I thought you said you were eating alone.

139
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,480
Well, I am. I <i>was</i>! I didn't know she-

140
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,680
Is that a problem?

141
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,220
I guess.

142
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,280
Can I get another salad?

143
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,170
Should I put a rush on that?

144
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,860
Oh my shit.

145
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,380
I'm sorry!

146
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,580
Oh! No, really.

147
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,370
I wasn't very hungry. And there's another one on the way.

148
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,880
I just don't eat much.

149
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,260
I mean, at least I didn't use to, but...

150
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,960
I plan on eating tons now!

151
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,360
Are you...

152
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,040
... in some kind of trouble?

153
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,820
Well, I'm on the run. If that's what you mean.

154
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,540
What?

155
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,860
No, stupid!

156
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,320
I just liked the way you're holding yourself. It was kind of interesting.

157
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,640
And your salad looked <i>ace</i>.

158
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,790
How was I holding myself?

159
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,870
You see?! You're laughing at yourself!

160
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,990
That's so... weirdly... great.

161
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,290
I assure you there's nothing "weirdly great" about me.

162
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,090
I'm Justin.

163
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,850
Justin.

164
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,620
Justin!

165
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,120
<i>Justin</i>.

166
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,130
And you are...

167
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,620
I'm what?

168
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
<i>Your name</i> is...

169
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
<i> January, February, March, April, -</i>
April!

170
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,860
Stop!

171
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,030
Dinner! I have a question.

172
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,760
Did your girlfriend just make up her name?

173
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,510
<i>You're deceiving me...</i>

174
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,090
You're deceiving me!

175
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,290
Oh, please...!

176
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,660
<i></i><i>This</i><i> </i>would be deceiving you.

177
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,150
Justin.

178
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,020
I have been wandering the world searching for one mortal man

179
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,420
who can make my body <i>quake with </i><i>sex</i>!

180
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,420
When I saw you eating your salad

181
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,770
I thought the planet was gonna blow the fuck up!

182
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,120
Do me like a lesbian, in front of all these jerk offs!

183
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,270
Stop! Stop!

184
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,890
What? That didn't happen?

185
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,280
Play the scene right.

186
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,720
That's <i>your </i>responsibility.

187
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,100
But be available to see things diversely...

188
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,680
Watching your life is a much different experience

189
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,420
than remembering it.

190
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,440
Really, I'm not hungry.

191
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,690
Have to go back to work.

192
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,480
Why?

193
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,100
"Why"?

194
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,350
Well, because I have to.

195
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,460
Sounds boring.

196
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,860
What's in there?

197
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,620
A book.

198
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,400
That's it?

199
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,850
That's it.

200
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,420
Keep a book locked up?

201
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,920
It's rare.

202
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,040
What is it?

203
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,460
Doesn't have a name.

204
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,820
Really?

205
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,500
Not that I've ever found.

206
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Are you okay?

207
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,440
Weird girl...

208
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,020
She was different.

209
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,980
I know <i>that</i>.

210
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,940
It's what made me fall for her so quickly.

211
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,630
"<i>Fall</i> for her"?

212
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,760
"<i>Fall</i><i></i> for her".

213
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,070
You humans speak of love as if it were a 10 story drop!

214
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,040
What?

215
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,300
<i>Oh</i>... the face.

216
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,610
Right.

217
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,370
Have you read "The tragical history of the life and death of Doctor Faustus"?

218
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,220
It's <i>hilarious</i>!

219
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,560
Pleasure to meet you.

220
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,660
Oh...

221
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,480
You're one of the smart ones.

222
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,760
Oh, come on!

223
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,600
You <i>know</i> you wanna kiss me.

224
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,940
That's right.

225
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,900
It's <i>me</i>...

226
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,100
Oh my God! You're the de-

227
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,120
Demon Jeez.

228
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,870
Hero of Hell.

229
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,310
You gave me <i>this</i><i></i>.

230
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,320
Oh my.

231
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,340
<i>That</i>'s good work.

232
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,800
Man, you are lucky to still be breathing!

233
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,140
Hmm... I can still taste your blood.

234
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,020
It's delicious!

235
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,050
You took her.

236
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,360
I know!

237
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,700
Got a medal for it too.

238
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,080
Now <i>that</i>'s what I call pretty.

239
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,060
Bring her back.

240
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,750
No.

241
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,480
Please!

242
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,960
You summoned Lo...

243
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,880
Then I'll summon you!

244
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,400
You <i>can't</i> summon two demons at once!

245
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,170
It's like trying to... fuck two chicks at the same time with one dick.

246
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,800
A Shish Kebab.

247
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,330
Well, if I'm not yourMaster then why are you here?

248
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,640
Are you kidding?

249
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,780
You're the mortal that tamed the beast.

250
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,430
I <i>had</i><i></i> to get an exclusive with you.

251
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,900
I don't know what you mean.

252
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,140
Oh, you do...

253
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,060
You <i>do </i>know what I mean.

254
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,430
See, I've come into contact with an innumerable amount of humans in my day.

255
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,780
Ah, sure! I've felt a few things for them.

256
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Disgust,...

257
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,800
embarrassment,...

258
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,200
sometimes a bit of humor,

259
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,200
and hunger!

260
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,290
But the one thing that I <i>never</i><i> did:</i>

261
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,880
fall in love with any of them!

262
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,850
That's why it's so weird...

263
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,490
What's weird?

264
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,190
That <i></i><i>it</i> fell in love with you.

265
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,900
"It"?

266
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,720
Well...!

267
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,880
You call it "April".

268
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,120
<i>Ew...</i>

269
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,300

349
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,220
I thought you didn't know her.

350
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,500
I lied.

351
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,400

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,420
You're disgusting.

353
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,560
To call me disgusting is to call her disgusting.

354
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,400
We're the same ilk.

355
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,840

356
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,020

357
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:53,240
So I'll explain it to you for the simple reality that it is.

358
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,160
Demons, all demons, ...

359
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,710
will eat, kill and rape anything.

360
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,300
Especially babies.

361
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,500
So I'll just reach down into the ass of Hell and get her for ya'.

362
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,150
And what about me?

363
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,300
If sh- she's everything you say she is, then what-

364
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,070
... Where do I fit in?

365
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,760
"What about you?"

366
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,560
That does amuse me to think about.

367
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,370
But you see, the thing about April is that pesky heart of hers.

368
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,960
You never knew what emotion it would settle into next.

369
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,490
She loved me.

370
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,810
Maybe.

371
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,910
But that doesn't change the facts.

372
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,250
You see, it happens all the time.

373
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,840
She gets restless, she doesn't understand why no one else does.

374
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,140
She calls in the middle of the night!

375
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,910
"I don't know why I feel this way!".

376
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,370
What am I supposed to tell her?!

377
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,250
I don't know why she feels this way!

378
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,630
One day she's a killer. A killer!

379
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,790
And then the next she's a fucking mess.

380
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,460
You were her friend.

381
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,980
No.

382
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,760
You can't bring her.

383
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,550
You don't have the strength it takes to do what I command.

384
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,950
"<i>I</i> don't have the strength"?

385
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,350
You can't even walk!

386
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,520
You're a cripple.

387
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,950
Can you feel that?

388
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,980
The essence of my hand, breaking through your barrier and squeezing your neck.

389
00:33:52,900 --> 00:34:00,730
I may not be able to kill you from here, but I'm most certainly powerful enough to make you feel my desire!

390
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,960
Leave at once.

391
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,520
Lo?

392
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,680
Hello?

393
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,320
Lo?

394
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,080
Lo?!

395
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,060
<i>Goddammit.</i>

396
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,470
Goddammit!

397
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:34,850
Goddammit, goddammit, goddammit, goddammit, goddammit, goddammit!

398
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
Goddammit!

399
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:41,090
<i>Goddammit, goddammit.</i> Goddammit! Goddammit! God damn...!

400
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,540
Goddammit!

401
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,480
Goddammit...!

402
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,120
<i>Who's that?</i>

403
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,700
<i>Who is that?</i><s></s>

404
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,640
Wait.

405
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,340
<i>It's saying what I'm thinking.</i>

406
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,580
<i>Just said that. And that!</i>

407
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,260
<i>I just said that, and I just said that, I just said that in my head! Oh my God, I can hear my thoughts out loud!</i>

408
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,840
<i>And I can't stop thinking!</i>

409
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,710
<i>Quick! Say something out loud. Hurry!</i>

410
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,750
<i>What the fuck was that? Did I just make noises?</i>

411
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,270
<i>Shit!</i>

412
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,040
<i>It's still happening. Say something out loud, a- a sentence! A complete sentence!</i>

413
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,240
"The boy went to the store"!

414
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,500
<i>That's my sentence?</i>

415
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,000
<i>Shit! Still here.</i>

416
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,580
<i>Okay...!</i>

417
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,760
<i>Okay, why- why- why am I hearing my own voice?</i>

418
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,620
<i>Where- Where is my voice coming from-</i>

419
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,120
<i>Did that get bigger? </i>

420
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,020
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

421
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,270
<i>It's my cut!</i>

422
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,440
<i>It's reading my mind and then saying it out loud!</i>

423
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,000
<i>Clear your mind.</i>

424
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,880
<i>Clear your mind, clear your mind, clear your mind...</i>

425
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,640
<i>This is so weird...</i>

426
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,950
<i>Fuck! Stop! Fuck it! Ignore the hand.</i>

427
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,120
<i>Think. Think...!</i>

428
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,780
<i>April's a demon!</i>

429
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,840
<i>She's always been a demon. Does that mean she really didn't love me?</i>

430
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,700
Of course she loved me! I know she did.

431
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,300
<i>And yet here we are: sitting in some dimensional pit-stop,</i>

432
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,160
<i>hearing stories about her slaughtering men for sport.</i>

433
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,620
Well, that's just it: these- these demons are liars. Lo admitted that.

434
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,880
<i>But what about the book?</i>

435
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,320
<i>Yeah...</i>

436
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,180
The book.

437
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,190
<i>A human wouldn't have a book like that.</i>

438
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,250
<i>She could've only gotten it one place.</i>

439
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,720
Hell...

440
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,440
<i>Hell.</i>

441
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,570
<i>She was from Hell.</i>

442
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,680
But...

443
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,560
She loved me.

444
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,390
<i>Did she?</i>

445
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,870
<i>Maybe you were just a refuge from the demons, the perfect patsy to lie low with.</i>

446
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,120
That bitch!

447
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,530
<i>I know!</i>

448
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:45,680
I'm... having a conversation... with my brain through my hand...!

449
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,900
Miss me? Shut up!

450
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,150
Shut up, my brain!

451
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,230
You're silly.

452
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,360
Where were <i>you</i>?

453
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,780
I went to get my smokes.

454
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,680
Demons smoke?

455
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,960
We do anything we want to do.

456
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,650
It's cool.

457
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,420
The circle is closing in on you.

458
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,920
The more you sit in there, the more the brain leaks.

459
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:33,560
So...

460
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,270
I found something for you.

461
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:36,960
April?

462
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,600
No, no way, brother. She's in some <i>serious</i> lock-up right now.

463
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,070
I brought a couple of kids to speak in her place!

464
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,300
I named them for you:

465
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,610
May... and June.

466
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,020
What are they?

467
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,310
They used to be human.

468
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,490
Guess which one killed them.

469
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,480
Now they live here.

470
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,800
May! Tell them what they do to you here.

471
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,350
<i>Well...</i>

472
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,230
<i>I am laid down on what appears to be a very large cheese grater.</i>

473
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,880
<i>There, two beasts...</i>

474
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,000
<i>one on each end, grab my hands and feet with their mouths...</i>

475
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,140
<i>and pull me back and forth...</i>

476
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,360
<i>slowly.</i>

477
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,200
<i>Shredding my back into little peelings.</i>

478
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,190
<i>Then, my eyelids are sliced off with a rusty razor blade!</i>

479
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,200
<i>And a demon stands over me...</i>

480
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,880
<i>and urinates into my eyeballs.</i>

481
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,110
<i>A funnel is placed in my mouth...</i>

482
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,960
<i>And pounds of broken glass are forced down my throat.</i>

483
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:18,700
<i>My neck is then sledgehammered flat and rats are brought in to gnaw it off!</i>

484
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,390
<i>It takes the rats about 12 minutes to chew through.</i>

485
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,720
<i>But I can't always be exact with the time.</i>

486
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,140
<i>As I often lose count...</i>

487
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,940
<i>Due to the high volumes of </i><i>pain</i><i>!</i>

488
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,200
<i>My head, then, still living...</i>

489
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,260
<i>Is placed into an oversized blend-</i>

490
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,020
And thank you, May.

491
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,820
<i>Okay...</i>

492
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,860
<i>But there's more.</i>

493
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,100
What is this?

494
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,650
Why are you showing me this?

495
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,100
This is good stuff!

496
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,470
This is the biz! How we operate.

497
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,100
You want me to find you April, I want you to know what April is.

498
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,740
<i>It tricked us.</i>

499
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,440
What?

500
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,690
<i>The demon... It tricked us.</i>

501
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,120
<i>It promised us a baby.</i>

502
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,520
<i>One piece of life,</i>

503
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,720
<i>for our eternal souls!</i>

504
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
<i>Cut with the dramatics!</i>

505
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,580
<i>Oh, yes! Sorry, June. Some of us still </i><i>feel</i><i>!</i>

506
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,960
<i>Oh, fuck you!</i>

507
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,860
Silence!

508
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,760
Idiots...

509
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,800
The baby.

510
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,230
<i>The demon...</i>

511
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,840
<i>It gave us what we wanted.</i>

512
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,240
<i>And for nine months, I knew my true purpose in life...</i>

513
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,970
<i>It was to raise this child,</i>

514
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,230
<i>and love it.</i>

515
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,070
<i>We should've tried </i>in vitro<i> first.</i>

516
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,000
<i>What? Before consulting the Devil?!</i>

517
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,680
<i>You</i><i>'re the one that said we needed candles!</i>

518
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,460
<i>"You can't summon a demon without candles!"</i>

519
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,000
<i>Well, if we're gonna do it then let's do it right!</i>

520
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,190
<i>I'm really sorry about this.</i>

521
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,580
<i>The torture down here turned her into a real </i><i>mega bitch</i><i>.</i>

522
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,940
<i>What?!
What!</i>

523
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:10,580
<i>Bitch.</i>

524
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,900
<i>Shut up!</i>

525
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,540
<i>It's on!</i>

526
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,820
<i>Sorry.
Sorry!</i>

527
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,480
The child.

528
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,780
<i>It died...</i>

529
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,090
<i>Hey! You.</i>

530
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,560
<i>Get us out of here.</i>

531
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,800
I- I'm sorry.

532
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,160
<i>Please! Take us with you.</i>

533
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,820
<i>Yeah! Please, mister. It really sucks here.</i>

534
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,520
I'm s- I'm sorry, I can't.

535
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,630
<i>Take us with you, we can't go back there!</i>

536
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,900
<i>Please, mister!</i>

537
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,180
<i>Hey, look! If you can only take one, take me.</i>

538
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:03,680
<i>No! </i><i>I</i><i>'m a woman. </i><i>I</i><i> can repay you in ways you'd like to be repaid...</i>

539
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,040
<i>I can do that too!</i>

540
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,460
<i>I mean, </i><i>I will</i><i>!</i>

541
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,560
I'm not helping you! Go back to hell and leave me alone.

542
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,060
Now that's funny.

543
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,110
Think about all the times you told someone to "go to Hell".

544
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,740
And now think about exactly what it is you're wishing upon them.

545
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,200
Just get her for me.

546
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,250
I can't!

547
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,110
And it's not because I'm "a cripple".

548
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,000
You wanna know why my legs drag behind me like a serpent's tail?

549
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,820
I promised I won't say.

550
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:51,440
I don't care.

551
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,190
April.

552
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,980
My legs were crushed when she was returned.

553
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,210
You helped her?

554
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,440
A demon...

555
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,700
heart or not...

556
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,980
should never entertain the idea that love is the answer to its questions.

557
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,840
She's back home now, but no longer free.

558
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,910
Held in the deepest pits and fed the sharpest pains.

559
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,680
If ever a woman was detained, it's <i>her</i>.

560
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,400
Would you really want to see her again given all you know?

561
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,100
I don't know what are lies and what aren't.

562
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,950
Nor were you meant to.

563
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,640
Would you like to see her again?

564
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,440
Then think about her.

565
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:55,620
A book?

566
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,440
Have you ever read it?

567
00:44:59,460 --> 00:44:59,930
No.

568
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,330
Well, it's good!

569
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,040
It's a- I mean, you know... I figured you liked rare books since you keep that one locked up, so...

570
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,050
It's a- It's a 1663 reprint.

571
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,280
So, you know... Not one of the oldest but... still pretty old!

572
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:19,270
You thought I might like this, so you bought it for me?

573
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:20,700
Yeah.

574
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:21,920
I mean...

575
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,090
Do you like it?

576
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,980
I think I do!

577
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,210
I've never read a book before! Except mine.

578
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,440
You never read a... <i>book</i>?

579
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,020
Except mine.

580
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,620
Nothing, never?

581
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,580
Not even in school?

582
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:38,580
Well... yes!

583
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,420
Well, yeah. In school!

584
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,540
I read a couple hundred in school...!

585
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,960
No, I meant: <i>other</i> than school!

586
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,100
What's it about?

587
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,830
Uh... It's about a guy who sells his soul to the Devil for knowledge and power.

588
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,630
What stupid...!

589
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,450
There's nothing to know...! Nothing worth that much pain, at least.

590
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,740
Oh, yeah? You- You've been there?

591
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:01,960
No.
Oh, yeah? You- You've been there?

592
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,260
No.

593
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:03,810
Never!

594
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,120
You're so bizarre.

595
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,900
Well?

596
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,960
Well... What?

597
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,060
I can't take the tease anymore!

598
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,330
"The tease"?

599
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,460
I want my present now, please!

600
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:26,230
<i>Your</i> present?

601
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,440
Right, right! Nice try, lady. Where is it at?

602
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,500
I want the goods, bring it out.

603
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,960
You... really didn't get me a present?

604
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,250
Oh, my God! No. No, baby.

605
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,020
It's fine, I- I- I didn't mean to expect one. I just, you know...

606
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,190
With Christmas I thought it'd be the whole... You know...

607
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,580
thing... I have no clue. Baby! It's so not important.

608
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,480
I'm so sorry...

609
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,560
We never celebrated Christmas.

610
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,640
I thought it was just an all-month party that ended December 25th!

611
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,100
You're serious?

612
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,480
Do you hate me?

613
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,070
I think I might... actually love you a little more now.

614
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,060
That's so weird...!

615
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,480
I told you. I'm a weird girl!

616
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:19,900
Good.

617
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,700
I do have a present for you!

618
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,780
Wait...! Wait!

619
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,920
You can't wrap something I already own. That's now how it works.

620
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,900
What, you're giving me your book?

621
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,660
Well, you have me a book.

622
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,160
Touché.

623
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,440
No.

624
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,280
That is something you can <i>never</i> do.

625
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,290
Open it?

626
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:30,870
Never!

627
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,240
Do you promise me?

628
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,720
Pray April, it's a-

629
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,880
Justin, no!

630
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,540
You have to burn this book. No questions.

631
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,880
No looking.

632
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,360
Just someday, when I'm not around,

633
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:46,760
burn it!

634
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:49,760
April.

635
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,060
What is this?

636
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,220
My past.

637
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,050
Never ask me that question again.

638
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,780
Burn. This. Book.

639
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,940
And wish me a Merry Christmas.

640
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,440
Merry Christmas...

641
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:17,930
<i>Demon~</i>

642
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,520
<i>Why wasn't she honest with you?</i>

643
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,600
<i>She obviously didn't trust you enough with the truth!</i>

644
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,840
She was ashamed of it...

645
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,960
<i>Or she had an agenda, and she knew exactly how to play you.</i>

646
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:33,440
No.

647
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,140
<i>Come on! You know what you are: you are a pushover!</i>

648
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,850
<i>Ridiculously bad social skills, and zero friends or family.</i>

649
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,850
<i>All you had was her.</i>

650
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,560
<i>And she knew that.</i>

651
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,940
No. We worked because we were different.

652
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,570
<i>You worked because that's the way she wanted it. She needed a place to hide!</i>

653
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,350
<i>You were nothing but a fake mustache!</i>

654
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,120
Shut up!

655
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,400
The circle's closing in on you...

656
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,200
I can deal...!

657
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,050
You kids crack my shit up!

658
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:15,040
If any of you knew what was actually going on up there in that tin you call a brain!

659
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,300
<i>Idiot...</i>

660
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,630
True on so many levels.

661
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,040
The circle's closing in on me...

662
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,500
May I take your order, sir?

663
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,960
Perhaps a drink to start with?

664
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,260
I know you...!

665
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,240
I doubt that.

666
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,010
You are my waiter!

667
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,420
I'm the waiter, sir.

668
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,140
Now... How about that drink?

669
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,080
No.

670
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,640
I assure you, sir, I'm the best bartender in this room.

671
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,060
I believe that...

672
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,590
But I don't want anything except April.

673
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,560
I will make you the best drink you have ever tasted.

674
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,430
I don't want a drink.

675
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,150
I want April.

676
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,220
I will call it... "April".

677
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,440
I don't want it.

678
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,840
It's not poison!

679
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,860
It weakens the pity.

680
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,620
I can't bring April to you. You have to go to her.

681
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,640
It's the only way.

682
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:22,220
Do you... actually want me to go on to Hell?

683
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,880
Yes, I do!

684
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:31,780
That drink looses the soul, allowing you to travel... <i>relatively unharmed </i>through the fires and the pits.

685
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,380
It's the only way a living man can pass through Hell.

686
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:41,680
Now... Is your April worth what you have to do to see her?

687
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,380
What's so funny?

688
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,780
It was poison.

689
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,700
Just me, buddy.

690
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:47,780
Dear.

691
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:49,720
Dear.

692
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:55,940
I heard you just fell for the old "drink this and you can walk through Hell" bit.

693
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,080
Bring back Lo.

694
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,080
I ain't that demon's keeper!

695
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,140
Am I dying?

696
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,600
Absolutely.

697
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,500
But slowly.

698
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:14,740
Demons like to use slow poison, so they can... watch you <i>twitch</i>.

699
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,640
Is there anything I can do?

700
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,660
Leave!

701
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:21,820
Get to a hospital. Pump it out.

702
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,840
I'm not leaving here without her.

703
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,140
Ain't no "her". Stop calling it female.

704
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,980
That's a human cage.

705
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,840
<i>We </i>are not defined by sex.

706
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,320
So this whole "love" thing...

707
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,940
Give me the breakdown.

708
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,780
I don't know what to tell you...

709
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,040
Well, pretend <i>I</i><i></i>'m April.

710
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,880
<i>Hi, Justin! I'm April!
Blah blah blah blah blah!</i>

711
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:11,140
One time, I tortured a guy who said it felt like a lump in your throat that you couldn't swallow.

712
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,690
Sounded annoying.

713
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,280
He was wrong.

714
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:21,100
A lump is too simple... Love is more complicated than that.

715
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,980
Oh! Oh, so the lump theory is just bullshit?

716
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,660
Every theory is bullshit!

717
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,040
There's no way I can define something you will never feel.

718
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,040
I'm a demon. I can do <i>anything</i>.

719
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,720
Except love.

720
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,780
Well, maybe I can! But I don't want <i>you</i> to know that I can.

721
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,050
That's a childish way to go about it.

722
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:57,080
Not being capable of love is a gift! I present exhibit "A" as ultimate proof:

723
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,920
One poor fool slowly dying in a circle!

724
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,510
What's <i>that</i> about?

725
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,140
That's my secret.

726
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:16,260
Justin, let me offer you some <i>really</i> groovy advice:

727
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,630
Read the chant, close the dimension, get to a hospital and finish your life!

728
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,740
Cause this shit? Blows!

729
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,420
Stop that!

730
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,660
You look like a child who just proudly shit his pants!

731
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,320
What's the matter, Jeez?

732
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,920
Can't handle the fact that you don't know everything?

733
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,900
Warning! You die here, and you belong to <i>us</i>.

734
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,000
You got a song about that?

735
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:45,770
Actually I do.

736
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:51,800
<i>But</i>... it's missing the baseline and hasn't been mixed yet so you don't get to hear it!

737
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,570
<i>You're dying.</i>

738
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:19,200
I guess I am.

739
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,410
<i>You're terrified of death.</i>

740
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,500
More than anything.

741
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,060
<i>And you're dying.</i>

742
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:27,640
Should I go?

743
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,780
Abandon all this? Leave her?

744
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,550
<i>I don't wanna die.</i>

745
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,540
I don't wanna die.

746
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,790
<i></i><i>I</i><i> don't wanna die.</i>

747
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,700
But I don't wanna live without her.

748
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,700
<i>You </i><i>had</i><i> to say that out loud...</i>

749
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:49,080
<i>I need to get rid of it. If I don't it'll keep talking to me, it will betray me and lie to me. I have to get rid of it!</i>

750
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,590
<i>Am I considering cutting off my hand...?</i>

751
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:55,380
<i>I am... I am! Oh, shit! But I have to!</i>

752
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,040
I have to...

753
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,020
<i>It's just as manipulative as they are. I can't trust it!</i>

754
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:06,440
<i>Oh, God! This is gonna hurt... Do I do this? I have to!</i>

755
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,840
<i>There's no choice, oh my God. I'm gonna cut my hand, okay. Okay, don't be-</i>

756
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,660
<i>Do it, do it. Do! Do! Do! Do! Do! Do!</i>

757
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,210
Hey!

758
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,440
Dumbass!

759
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,170
You looking to speed up the death process or what?

760
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,790
You poisoned me...

761
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,450
And?

762
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:36,620
Why you?

763
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,960
Why did she mark your page?

764
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,260
Maybe it was a coincidence.

765
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,550
Or maybe she thought I was cute.

766
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,670
You're so afraid to give me a straight answer.

767
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,740
If I'm just a stupid human then why do I scare you so much?

768
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:58,030
The safety of that circle has swelled your ego something fierce.

769
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,500
Why did you help her escape?

770
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,850
What I do on my own time is no concern of yours.

771
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,340
They crushed your body.

772
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,820
And rightfully so!

773
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:17,740
I paid my price!

774
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,500
There's no need for you to be involved in demon affairs...

775
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,950
You are not built for Hell, trust me.

776
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,180
I'm touched you're so concerned with my well-being...

777
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:46,230
There's nothing you can do for her.

778
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,620
She broke a sacred law!

779
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,160
She is a vile creature!

780
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,960
Maybe I don't care about that.

781
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,460
Oh, brother, you really should.

782
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,130
That's who she was here.

783
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:02,060
That's not who she is in my world.

784
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:09,860
And escaped murderer is still a murderer.

785
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,500
<i>It's okay.</i>

786
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,580
<i>It's okay.</i>

787
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,400
It was a bad one.

788
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,840
Do you wanna tell me about it?

789
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,060
Maybe it's time to see a doctor.

790
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,460
I've been reading about night terrors lately.

791
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:29,900
Fuck. Justin. It's just a dream, everyone has them.

792
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,000
Not like you do.

793
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,680
You've been talking more in your sleep lately.

794
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:41,750
What am I saying?

795
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,690
Mostly you just apologize.

796
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:48,810
April.

797
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,220
I think-

798
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:50,360
<i>Shh.</i>
I think-

799
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,000
<i>Shh.</i>

800
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,840
Tell me you don't smell anything.

801
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,180
Weird.

802
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What?
I think I smell sulfur.
Shit.

803
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:21,820
This guy?

804
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,100
Jeez.

805
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,040
Nice costume.

806
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:26,390
Go back.

807
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,070
Oh, I plan on it.

808
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:30,470
I'm stronger than you are.

809
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,080
Sister, you're long time out of practice.

810
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:08,940
Justin.

811
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,460
He's dying...

812
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,120
Well, I should hope so!

813
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,210
I don't scratch.

814
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,880
Let me help him.

815
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,610
And I'll go with you...

816
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,740
<i>April... April...</i>

817
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:57,730
I have to leave.

818
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,130
I'm sorry...

819
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:18,460
The book...!

820
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:33,260
April...!

821
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,500
April... April!

822
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,120
You came here for love.

823
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,360
You're no better than Faust!

824
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,800
Faust sought power and knowledge.

825
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:57,780
Which is all <i>you</i> seek!

826
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,840
Love would have had you destroy that book <i>as you had promised!</i>

827
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,640
A demon cannot harm it, only a mortal can.

828
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,740
You betrayed your love.

829
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,620
That's the difference between you and me.

830
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,870
Humanity is allowed to make mistakes. It's expected of us.

831
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,040
Well, that's just stupid.

832
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,260
What do you know of how we feel?

833
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,440
Except what you get out of us through torture.

834
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:33,180
You demons claim to be all-powerful, yet you're beaten by your own jealousy towards us!

835
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,640
Now that shit was funny.

836
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,390
Demon!

837
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,720
Foul, horrible, disgusting demon!

838
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,140
I am your Master!

839
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:48,590
You are my dog!

840
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:51,720
When I summoned you, I summoned the power to command you.

841
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,620
When I say you'll roll over, that is <i>exactly </i>what you will do!

842
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,180
I have seen you toss yourself around this room...

843
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:05,220
In a dozen different forms, planting seeds in my head and laughing as you watch them grow!

844
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,850
But I say "no more"!

845
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:13,320
I am done with the games and the trickery!
I will not go away, no matter how many times you poison me!

846
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:15,140
I summoned you...!

847
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:19,220
Now I command you, demon Lo!

848
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:29,640
Scour the depths of Hell... Find my girl... Sit her right down in front of me.

849
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,520
And fuck off<i>.</i>

850
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:56,940
Justin...

851
01:11:59,040 --> 01:11:59,580
Baby.

852
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:06,240
Hi...

853
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:07,900
Hi.

854
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,800
Strange place to be picking up girls.

855
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:14,340
Yeah.

856
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:19,080
You kept my book.

857
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:21,680
Yeah...

858
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,320
I tried to burn it.

859
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,260
I actually... don't know why I couldn't.

860
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,330
It's okay.

861
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,790
They were pissed when they found "Faust" in the case.

862
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,480
I'm here to take you with me.

863
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:38,110
I know.

864
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,240
I'm giddy, can't you tell?

865
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:47,220
I need you to... tell me the chant I need to use.

866
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,520
To take you back with me.

867
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,190
You still want to save me...

868
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,740
... After all you've heard...?

869
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,440
"Hell's MVP"...

870
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,560
I don't believe that.

871
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,820
I know your true heart.

872
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:04,360
I know it's not capable of that.

873
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:05,470
But it is.

874
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:14,140
Tell me... you won't eat me...  and I'll make you my wife.

875
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:19,550
You'd love me?

876
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,080
Page 1108.

877
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:39,820
<i>Tiana.
... Tiana.</i>

878
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,780
<i>Fait simei.
... Fait simei.</i>

879
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,760
<i>Neft tiana simei.
... Neft tiana simei.</i>

880
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,780
<i>Tan corsé si.
... Tan corsé si.</i>

881
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,190
I can't go with you...

882
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,750
Of course you can.

883
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,560
We'll hide, they won't find us.

884
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,780
No, they will.

885
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,500
And next time, they'll kill you.

886
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:43,780
Then let me stay here.

887
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:45,360
No...

888
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:45,940
No.

889
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,740
This is not where I will let you spend eternity.

890
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:52,470
You have no choice <i>at all</i> in this matter.

891
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,560
I have nothing worth in my life without you there.

892
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:01,130
<i>I'm not a woman... Justin.</i>

893
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,430
<i>I'm not human.</i>

894
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,100
But you... love me.

895
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:15,760
Keep your word to me.

896
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,160
You're going home...

897
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,200
April!
