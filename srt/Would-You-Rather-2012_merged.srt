1
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,991
You're available
to start right away?

2
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,160
Yes.

3
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,625
I'm not really seeing
a lot of restaurant experience

4
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,628
on the résumé.

5
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,839
I've always had,
um, summer jobs,

6
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,341
but, yeah, mostly retail.

7
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,391
So did you drop out
of school, or...

8
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,894
Why'd you come
all the way back here?

9
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,271
No...

10
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,481
Well, this is my home,

11
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,483
and there was an accident,

12
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,735
so I have to take care
of my brother.

13
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,785
Well, I'll tell you
what I can do...

14
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,537
I'll talk to the owner.

15
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,539
I know they were looking for,

16
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,043
waitstaff with experience,
but...

17
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,045
obviously you're smart,
so maybe they'll,

18
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,380
work with you, so...

19
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,840
Sure, that'd be...
that'd be great.

20
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,843
Maybe you could do...
host, if nothing else.

21
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,512
Oh, sure, definitely.

22
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,099
Okay, I mean,
I can't promise anything, but...

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,308
- Oh, no, yeah.
- Maybe.

24
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,559
I'll let you know
by the end of the day.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,019
Thank you so much.
Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,104
Nice meeting you.

27
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,579
I can make you some eggs
if you want.

28
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,332
Yeah, I can make 'em too.

29
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,751
I'm gonna go back to the clinic

30
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,919
for a little while today.

31
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,170
Will you be okay here alone?

32
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,672
Something wrong?

33
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,757
Dr. Barden thinks that

34
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,842
he can help us
cut some of the costs.

35
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,762
How?

36
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,224
I... I have no idea,

37
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,808
but I'll find out.

38
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:51,355
So there'll probably be
some of this... yeah?

39
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,024
Yeah, probably.

40
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,567
Thank you.

41
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,549
Thank you.

42
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,804
Thank you both.

43
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,058
Dr. Barden?

44
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,393
The nurse said that I...

45
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,644
Of course, come in.

46
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,773
Iris, good to see you.

47
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,024
Hi.

48
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,819
Iris, Shepard Lambrick.

49
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,612
Iris.

50
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,073
Dr. Barden's told me
much about you.

51
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,451
Iris, please, have a seat.
Shepard.

52
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,958
So...

53
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,919
Your brother.

54
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,589
He's quite sick, correct?

55
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,674
You can help him?

56
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,928
Well, let's just say
that my foundation

57
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,472
has the ability
to improve his situation.

58
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,642
The Lambricks have funded
the building of clinics

59
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,893
all over the world,

60
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,438
Haiti, Afghanistan...

61
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,605
Schools too.

62
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,774
Well, my brother
doesn't need a school.

63
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,610
You're right.

64
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,862
Absolutely right.

65
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,740
Because we're not
talking about that today.

66
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,492
Not at all.

67
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,789
My family also believes in

68
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,126
creating opportunities for...

69
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,211
everyday people,

70
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:43,717
people who just haven't
received a fair shake in life,

71
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,969
people like you
and your brother.

72
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,013
What do we have to do?

73
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,434
I'm hosting a dinner party
tomorrow night,

74
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,269
and I'd like you to join us.

75
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,688
Just me?

76
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,898
Just you.

77
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,108
But there will be
other guests there,

78
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,527
individuals that
we'd also like to help,

79
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,363
and the evening will culminate

80
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,533
with a game of sorts,

81
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,703
and the winner...

82
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,830
will be taken care of.

83
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:17,376
Bills, school, house...
everything.

84
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,545
A contest.

85
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,547
What if I don't win?

86
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,093
Well, then you just don't win.

87
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,177
That's it.

88
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:32,015
I'm sorry, Dr. Barden, I...

89
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,059
no offense to Mr. Lambrick,

90
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,687
but is this legit?

91
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,606
This is for real?

92
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,401
Very real, Iris.

93
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,905
Mr. Lambrick saved my life.

94
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,035
Not long ago,

95
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,830
but before I met
you and your brother,

96
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,207
I was in the same position.

97
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,543
I'd already lost my wife.

98
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,211
I was on my way
to losing everything...

99
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,587
this practice, everything.

100
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,882
I had no place to turn.

101
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,513
I was invited to this event,
so I went.

102
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,266
You won?

103
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,518
He did, and I am proud to say

104
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,729
that the Lambrick Foundation
came through on its promise.

105
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,398
Tenfold.

106
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,111
You see what we might be able
to do for you.

107
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,615
Well, money
would definitely help,

108
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,744
but my brother needs
a bone marrow transplant.

109
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:40,750
So do you mind
if I think this over?

110
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,918
It's just...

111
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,587
Short notice.

112
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,255
It is. You're right.

113
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,591
Of course, yes.

114
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,301
Think it over.

115
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,427
Do that.

116
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,346
Well...

117
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,272
But RSVP by 8:00 tonight

118
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,024
if you do decide to join us.

119
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,530
And my staff will make
arrangements to pick you up.

120
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,949
Thank you.

121
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,287
When I say
that we have the ability

122
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,457
to dramatically improve
your brother's situation, Iris,

123
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,543
it's not just the money
I'm talking about.

124
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,712
You win the game,

125
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,547
and we can bypass
any waiting list

126
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,550
and locate a donor immediately.

127
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,182
I will let you know.

128
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,225
Thank you.

129
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,985
She's perfect.

130
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,823
This is the special du jour.

131
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,494
It's pasta à la vegetable...

132
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,828
Okay.

133
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,498
Iris, that's a terrible
Italian accent.

134
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,793
And if it's French,

135
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,629
"monsieur" is not pronounced
"man sewer."

136
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,838
- Monsieur.
- Monsieur.

137
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,340
- Monsieur.
- Yes.

138
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,259
Come on, seriously, like,
it's not gonna kill me

139
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,718
to have some protein
now and then.

140
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,889
Hello?

141
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,851
Speaking.

142
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,695
Okay, well, wait,

143
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,656
what about the hostess position
that you...

144
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,245
Okay, well, thank you.

145
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,371
Thanks again.

146
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,042
You mad at me or something?

147
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,919
Why would I be mad at you?

148
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,550
I thought I would be a match.

149
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,220
I feel like I let you down.

150
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,060
You can't always be the hero.

151
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,106
Sometimes you have to let go.

152
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,774
Like let go of you?

153
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,831
Get down! Get down!
Give me cover!

154
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,338
Killing lots of aliens?

155
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,173
Nope, terrorists.

156
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,175
Killing lots of terrorists?

157
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,510
Straight up murderin'
these terrorists, yo.

158
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,349
What's up?

159
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,811
So, I'm gonna go out tonight.

160
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,271
With who?

161
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,942
I... I ran into a couple
friends from high school,

162
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,363
and I thought, you know what?

163
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,032
I should go and unwind.

164
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,950
Yeah, let your hair down
and shit.

165
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,370
Yeah, just go crazy.

166
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,954
Yeah, cool.

167
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,874
So you're gonna be okay here
alone for the night?

168
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,834
Yeah.

169
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,836
Got my meds, emergency contact.

170
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,506
I'll just play video games
or whatever.

171
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,550
I could really use the quiet.

172
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,886
Great.

173
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,179
Cool.

174
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,556
Love you.

175
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,574
Aren't you sick of this?

176
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,495
Taking me back and forth
to the clinic,

177
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,164
bills, taking care of me.

178
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,331
Like, don't you want a life?

179
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,458
No.

180
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,087
I mean, yeah, I...

181
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,547
It's hard,

182
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,300
but, Raleigh,
you're my brother.

183
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,720
This is my life.

184
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,430
It's gonna be fine.

185
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,765
We'll get through this.

186
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,769
This way, please.

187
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,021
Thank you.

188
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,776
Pretty.

189
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,194
Yes.

190
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,449
Does the Lambrick family
live here?

191
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,117
Not exactly.

192
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,994
Property's owned
by the foundation.

193
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,956
It's used for holidays
and special events like this.

194
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,125
Dinner will begin shortly.

195
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,127
You can wait in here
with all the other guests,

196
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,965
and please help yourself to any
of the provided refreshments.

197
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,807
Our eighth and final guest.

198
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,229
Lucky number eight.

199
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,486
Did everyone get
an introduction like that?

200
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,655
Oh, yeah.
It's been very formal.

201
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,074
It's nice to meet you guys.
I'm Iris.

202
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,617
Lucas, and this is...

203
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,660
Cal. How you doin'?

204
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,036
Hi.

205
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,288
Have you guys been here long?

206
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,289
Not long.

207
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,623
Couple minutes for some.

208
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,625
Hour or two for the rest of us.

209
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,085
Are you both from the area too?

210
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,421
No, they flew me in
from Seattle.

211
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,215
Iowa.

212
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,342
Would you like
a little something to drink?

213
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,012
No, I'm okay. Not yet.

214
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,265
So what do you know
about the others?

215
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,266
Anything?

216
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,934
A little.

217
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,270
As you can see,
they're not exactly gregarious.

218
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,107
Big guy over there is Peter.

219
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:05,028
Supposed to be some sort of
high-stakes gambler from Vegas.

220
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,988
Not that any of us
have actually heard of him.

221
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,365
That's the way
he made it sound.

222
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,617
Yeah.

223
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,410
Lady in the wheelchair
is Linda.

224
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,703
She barely speaks.

225
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,127
Kid in the corner is Travis.

226
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,295
He's an Iraq vet.

227
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,799
And he's got
that thousand-yard stare.

228
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,677
What about the girl?

229
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,679
Her name is Amy,

230
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,890
and, yeah,
she's a real charmer.

231
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,309
And the older gentleman?

232
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,063
I don't think
I'd call him that.

233
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,147
"Older"?

234
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,482
"Gentleman."

235
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,566
Why?

236
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,735
Conway's a bit of a sourpuss.

237
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,403
Yeah, he's...

238
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,907
he has some conspiracy theories
about the Lambrick Foundation.

239
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,034
Don't get him started.

240
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,243
Maybe I will have a drink.

241
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,912
Good.

242
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,623
My very own specialty: BLT.

243
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,922
Thank you.

244
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,966
To the Lambrick Foundation.

245
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,217
Salud.

246
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,478
She's perfect.

247
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:22,606
Case?

248
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,197
I'm not sure
she's right for this.

249
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,824
What?

250
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,451
She couldn't be more perfect.

251
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,787
She's fighting for her brother,
herself.

252
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,789
She has no relatives,
no family,

253
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,374
no one to ask questions.

254
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,793
Shep, she is not right.

255
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,465
Let's just say
I've appreciated your discretion

256
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,134
over the last couple of years.

257
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,723
Should I be concerned

258
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,142
about this moment of weakness
on your part?

259
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,063
Of course not.

260
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,398
I'm fine.

261
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:13,031
Bevans has informed me
that the last guest has arrived.

262
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,199
We ought to get downstairs soon.

263
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,871
Do we have to sit through
an entire dinner?

264
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,706
Why can't we just
get it over with?

265
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,416
Julian...

266
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,334
That's not the way it works,
as you know.

267
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,336
There is a process involved.

268
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,589
Of course.

269
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,760
I trust that you will be
on your best behavior tonight.

270
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,637
I'm not even drinking.

271
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,514
I'm serious.

272
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,310
The integrity of the game

273
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,980
requires minimal participation
on our part.

274
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,984
You must remain
an objective observer,

275
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,320
even if one of these people
is eliminated.

276
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,488
Do you understand?

277
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,657
And if one of them
has to be removed from the game,

278
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,993
Bevans will be the one
to handle it.

279
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,579
Your job, as a Lambrick,

280
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,122
is simply to observe.

281
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,793
You can engage these people
with questions and conversation,

282
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,796
but you will
not so much as touch

283
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,047
any of these people tonight.

284
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,760
I know.

285
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,348
Julian,

286
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,976
look, I appreciate

287
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,978
that you've taken an interest
in the foundation.

288
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,230
I do.

289
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,483
But what happened last year
was unacceptable.

290
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,528
For the last time,

291
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,570
I understand.

292
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,572
Okay, okay, okay.

293
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,740
I won't bring it up again.

294
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,701
And you're underdressed again.

295
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,380
We have one small matter
to clear up before we begin.

296
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,882
In the interest of discretion

297
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,553
and eliminating distraction
and unfair advantage,

298
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,721
we ask that you leave
all possessions here

299
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,390
during the game...

300
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,058
phones, keys, et cetera.

301
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,270
I don't like this.

302
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,022
I don't like it.

303
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,859
I assure you they will be safe.

304
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,487
These are the rules.

305
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,971
Right.

306
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,140
If you're ready,

307
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,475
I'll escort you
through to the dining room.

308
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,560
This way.

309
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,890
Please, take a seat.

310
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,892
Place cards have been provided.

311
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,880
Thank you.

312
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,006
Of course.

313
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,859
And good evening, everyone.

314
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,530
I apologize
if I've kept anyone waiting.

315
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,533
Welcome to the Lambrick house.

316
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,576
This is my son, Julian.

317
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,703
Hello.

318
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:34,250
Now, you've all met
our butler, Bevans,

319
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,002
and his staff, yes?

320
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,169
Bevans...

321
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,381
Let's start with some wine,
shall we?

322
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,767
Dinner tonight
is seared foie gras

323
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,312
and rib eye steak
with a red wine reduction

324
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,357
served with asparagus
and garlic leek mashed potato.

325
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,775
Enjoy.

326
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,279
Haven't had a meal like this
in so long.

327
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,489
Never had a meal like this.

328
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,532
You kidding me?

329
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,581
Yes?

330
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,583
I probably should have
mentioned this before.

331
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,835
I'm a vegetarian.

332
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,256
Well, this is interesting.

333
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:26,052
We don't have anything else
in the kitchen, Iris.

334
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,136
Okay.

335
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,471
I...I don't mean to be a bother.

336
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,806
The potatoes are fine.
I'll be fine.

337
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,017
So have you always
been a vegetarian?

338
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,979
Most of my life, yes.
Long time.

339
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,689
- I just can't imagine eating...
- I think...

340
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,069
That we have just found
our first opportunity

341
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,572
to award some money tonight.

342
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,492
Iris.

343
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,578
I would like for you to eat
the steak and the foie gras.

344
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,914
I really would.

345
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,582
I can't do that.

346
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,793
You can...

347
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,127
but you won't...

348
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,170
yet.

349
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,758
No, I really... I can't do it.

350
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,218
I'm not trying to be rude.

351
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,887
I just...I won't do it.

352
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:14,642
Listen, I understand
that it's not going to be easy,

353
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:18,938
but I refuse to accept...

354
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:23,609
that you don't have a price.

355
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,446
$5,000 to eat the steak

356
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:31,283
and this decadent foie gras.

357
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,455
Make it $10,000.

358
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,587
$10,000.

359
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,259
What could you do with that?

360
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,760
You should eat it.

361
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,304
Just close your eyes.

362
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,806
It's a lot of money.

363
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,458
Eat it with some of the liver.

364
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,628
I can't believe I'm doing this.

365
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,380
Yeah, for $10,000, though.

366
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:32,470
A lifetime of discipline

367
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,305
and commitment to cause

368
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,309
wiped away by a mere $10,000.

369
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,776
Well...

370
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,862
That is nothing

371
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,989
compared to what's
really at stake tonight.

372
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,616
I can assure you of that.

373
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,041
You don't like the wine?

374
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,670
Well, no, it's not that.

375
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,714
We can get you something else.

376
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,466
We have some wonderful scotch.

377
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,260
No. No, thanks. I don't drink.

378
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,224
Oh, I see.

379
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,602
You're a recovering alcoholic.

380
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,103
Aren't you?

381
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,609
That's not your business.

382
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,778
On the contrary.

383
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,405
You are here essentially
begging me for money.

384
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,074
How is that not my business?

385
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,996
How long has it been?

386
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,336
It's been 16 years,

387
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,338
and I turned everything
in my life around.

388
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,007
But you haven't.

389
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,342
Look at you.

390
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,928
You're still mired in a pit
of poor health

391
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,222
and crippling debt.

392
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,849
I'd hate to see what
you looked like 16 years ago.

393
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,310
I mean, really.
What's the point?

394
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,478
Please.

395
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,314
Why are you doing this?

396
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,151
Because I want to help you.

397
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,696
Look...

398
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,158
It's safe to say that drinking

399
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,245
is what ruined your life
in the first place, isn't it?

400
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,247
So what if

401
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:27,042
drinking again
could help you save it?

402
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,752
What?

403
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,423
I will give you $10,000

404
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,633
if you drink
that glass of wine.

405
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,804
No.

406
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,140
No. No way. No.
You don't understand.

407
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,100
You have no idea
how hard I've worked.

408
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,812
But Iris here,

409
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,481
she just devoured
a pile of meat,

410
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,609
and she's a devout vegetarian,

411
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,278
and you won't drink
a little wine?

412
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,613
It's totally different.

413
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,323
Why are you doing this to me?

414
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,076
$50,000.

415
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,038
If you will drink...

416
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,168
This decanter

417
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,671
of the finest scotch
that money can buy

418
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,173
right now.

419
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,009
$50,000.

420
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,803
This is what, a test?
This is not real.

421
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,888
Oh, no...

422
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,433
I am deadly serious, Conway,

423
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,101
and you know that I am.

424
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,022
The glass of wine

425
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,941
or the whole damn decanter.

426
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,610
Now, it seems to me
that the wine,

427
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,613
that's pretty simple,

428
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,781
isn't it?

429
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,283
But the scotch...

430
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,578
Well, we could consider that...

431
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,957
A momentary lapse to...

432
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,127
Change your life.

433
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,300
I'm sorry.

434
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,345
I'm sorry.

435
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,305
So what would you rather do?

436
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,994
That's a good man.

437
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,496
Hey.

438
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,664
Bevans.

439
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,544
That was brilliant, as usual.

440
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,462
My compliments to Marcel.

441
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,264
Regarding tonight's game,

442
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:49,852
please allow me to alleviate
any concerns you have.

443
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,313
We haven't already
been playing?

444
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:56,442
Oh, no, the game has yet
to officially begin.

445
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,902
What exactly is the game?

446
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,906
Well, it is not a quiz
or a trivia contest,

447
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,744
nor is it a test of
brute strength or athleticism.

448
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,371
At its core,
it's just a children's game,

449
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,873
and I would wager

450
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,708
that some of you
here this evening

451
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:17,880
have played "Would You Rather?"
at some point.

452
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,009
So how do we play?

453
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:28,056
In each round, each player
will be given a choice

454
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,393
between A or B,

455
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,061
and usually,

456
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,731
neither choice
is very attractive.

457
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,316
Let's see if I can
give you an example.

458
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,567
Travis.

459
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,197
Travis, would you rather...

460
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,866
kiss Iris

461
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,867
or...

462
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:47,868
Peter?

463
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,956
- Guess I'd kiss Iris.
- Very good.

464
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:57,294
Now, this is where our version
of the game is different.

465
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,129
Whatever you choose,

466
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,591
you must act upon.

467
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,926
So in this case,

468
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:08,597
Travis, you must walk over
and kiss Iris.

469
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,974
You're gonna make us
kiss each other?

470
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,435
No, no, no.

471
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,895
Nothing like that, my dear.

472
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,980
No, that was just
off the top of my head.

473
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:21,485
Now, as the game continues

474
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,488
with one dilemma after another,

475
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,157
eliminating players as we go

476
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:31,495
until we have a winner.

477
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,664
And how are players eliminated?

478
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,998
Well, if a player

479
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,584
is no longer capable
of continuing,

480
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,963
for whatever reason,
then they are eliminated.

481
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,048
What if someone refuses
to make a choice?

482
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,176
Like, if Travis didn't want
to kiss either of us?

483
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,637
If you refuse to choose.

484
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,805
Well, I am afraid

485
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,641
that that would be grounds
for elimination.

486
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,309
And one more thing.

487
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,146
The dilemmas are timed.

488
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:05,737
And you must make your decision
in 15 seconds,

489
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,532
or you will be eliminated.

490
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,952
Hold up. Is all this necessary?

491
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,370
I mean, couldn't you
help all of us?

492
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,038
Why does this have to be
a game?

493
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,041
Because,

494
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:22,754
as simple as the game is,

495
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:28,093
it's all about decision making
in its rawest form.

496
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:31,221
And there's no better window
into a person's character

497
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,848
than the decisions
that they make

498
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,516
and how they make them

499
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:37,519
and how one applies

500
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,022
rationale and ethics and reason

501
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,524
while under duress.

502
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,030
Tonight...

503
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,159
Will test your limits

504
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,038
and ultimately prove...

505
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,707
whether you deserve our help.

506
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:03,086
If anyone no longer
wishes to play,

507
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:07,883
now is your opportunity
to leave.

508
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,093
We have cars waiting outside.

509
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,348
Anyone?

510
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,785
All right.

511
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,496
We have a full house.

512
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,582
And so...

513
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,588
Here...

514
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,925
we...

515
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,343
go.

516
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,979
Our man Bevans,
ladies and gentlemen.

517
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,443
Did you know he was formerly
an agent with MI5?

518
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,278
Many years ago.

519
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,613
An interrogator.

520
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,120
Is this one of your old toys,
Bevans?

521
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,622
It is, sir.

522
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,250
Car batteries with some
aftermarket configurations.

523
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,006
What... what the hell is this?

524
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,757
Oh, no.
I see where this is going.

525
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,842
Conway?

526
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,344
I knew this was too good
to be true.

527
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,139
This is a joke.
You just want to hurt us.

528
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,807
You people,
are you gonna sit here,

529
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,100
and you're gonna let this sick,

530
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,477
perverted son of a bitch
debase you?

531
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,729
Be my guest.

532
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,230
Someone's had
a little too much to drink.

533
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,398
That's right!

534
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,482
That's right,
and I'm going home.

535
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,359
No, you've already
been given that chance.

536
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,485
I don't care!

537
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,820
I'm done with this!

538
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,155
You were warned.

539
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,990
You go to hell,
you sick motherfucker!

540
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,017
I would like to go home.

541
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,602
Well, obviously,

542
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:27,272
participation
is no longer voluntary.

543
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,525
I believe we just made that
perfectly clear.

544
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,906
Bevans, shall we?

545
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,226
What's this?

546
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,352
What are we doing?

547
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,021
Cal, you're up first.

548
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,941
So, Cal,

549
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,443
would you rather...

550
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,945
electrocute yourself,

551
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,114
or would you rather

552
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,949
electrocute Amy?

553
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,118
The blue button is for you.

554
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,455
Press the red button
if you'd rather zap Amy.

555
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,291
And you have...

556
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,377
15 seconds to decide,

557
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,003
beginning now.

558
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,006
- W-wait.
- Wait.

559
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,008
- Stop, stop, don't push it.
- Wait, Bevans...

560
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,301
Okay, wait, wait, stop.

561
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,928
Don't push the button.

562
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,526
Moving on.

563
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,657
You're not serious.

564
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,118
No! Oh, no!

565
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,287
- Oh, come on!
- Blue is for Linda.

566
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,039
No, no, no, no, no, please!

567
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,166
Amy.

568
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,917
You're next.

569
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,837
Would you rather
electrocute yourself or...

570
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,921
Wait...

571
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,842
Take it easy!

572
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,844
We're competing, right?

573
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,641
No timer needed.

574
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,726
Linda.

575
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,768
Linda!

576
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,066
Bevans, is she ready?

577
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,904
Linda.

578
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,488
Can you hear me?

579
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,451
Your turn.

580
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,704
I can't do this.

581
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,331
Well, you have to do it, Linda.

582
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,333
You must make a decision.

583
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,834
It's the game.

584
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,170
Red is for Peter.

585
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,671
I don't think
I can do this either.

586
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,758
All right.

587
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,551
What was that?

588
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,638
Christ.

589
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,306
Would you rather

590
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,266
electrocute yourself,

591
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,643
again,

592
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,270
or shock Peter?

593
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,730
15 seconds.

594
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,367
Fuck!

595
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,373
Well done, both of you.

596
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,709
Next.

597
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,568
Are you okay?

598
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,652
Stall 'em.

599
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,112
- Are you okay?
- I can do one more.

600
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,031
- What?
- Just stall 'em.

601
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,532
I'm not gonna shock you.

602
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,376
Iris.

603
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,670
What have you seen
in the last ten minutes

604
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,880
that leads you to believe

605
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,465
you don't have to perform
in this round?

606
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,385
Keep... still.

607
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,639
Much better.

608
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,978
Red is for Iris.

609
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,816
Now, Lucas,
what would you rather do?

610
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,779
Red is for Cal.

611
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,658
Iris, would you rather
electrocute yourself

612
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,786
or Cal for the second time?

613
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,997
You do what you got to do.

614
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,667
Go.

615
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,516
That's an interesting choice.

616
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,230
Right.

617
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,235
Well done, everyone.

618
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,195
Very well done.

619
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,738
Now...

620
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,117
I'm gonna give you a moment,
all,

621
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,786
to compose yourselves

622
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,790
while we prepare
for the next round.

623
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,027
Listen, we just need a moment,
some kind of distraction.

624
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,862
If we all move at once,
we can overpower 'em.

625
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,322
It seems like
they're all packing,

626
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,490
so that's not much of a plan.

627
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,492
If we can disarm one,
I can shoot.

628
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,368
That'll even the odds
pretty fucking quick.

629
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,287
What about the doors?
They have us locked in.

630
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,372
I saw a couple of 'em
with sets of keys.

631
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,209
Here comes another set
right now.

632
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,172
Hi, everyone.

633
00:41:56,305 --> 00:42:00,141
The game's getting pretty
intense already, right?

634
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,435
Why are you doing this?

635
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,562
"Why are you doing this?"

636
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,814
You're fucking crazy.

637
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,736
You know...

638
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,738
you agreed to be here.

639
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,701
You're basically asking
my family for a handout.

640
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,872
The least you could do, pig,

641
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,707
is show a little
fucking respect.

642
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,751
Psycho little bitch.

643
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,419
Excuse me, what?

644
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,588
You heard me, bitch.

645
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,507
I'm sorry, we didn't get
formally introduced.

646
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,758
Well, now we have.

647
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,677
How about you show us
a little respect?

648
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,803
Stop.

649
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,514
What's your name?

650
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,477
Name, pig! What's your name?

651
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,937
- Travis Schulke!
- Okay, Travis.

652
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,939
Travis,

653
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,232
you're the soldier, right?

654
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,485
Well, allow me to thank you

655
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:55,321
for your bravery
and your service.

656
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,490
Really.

657
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,827
But yeah, that said...

658
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,747
Opening your mouth
was a big mistake.

659
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,874
Easy, easy.

660
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,084
So...

661
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:17,051
Cover the walls and the...

662
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,553
area around the table.

663
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,645
Wait. What are you guys doing?

664
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,398
That was incredibly stupid,
Travis.

665
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,275
I will fuck that guy up
if I get the chance.

666
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,526
But you won't.

667
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,736
Cool it.

668
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,948
They want us
to turn on each other.

669
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,451
If we stay logical,
we can turn the tables on 'em.

670
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,744
She's on her own.

671
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,079
Look around you.

672
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,205
Yeah, we're fucked.

673
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,102
And so we begin again.

674
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:53,648
Does anyone need to use
the restroom or anything?

675
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,028
I'm just joking.

676
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,197
I know you're probably all
just as eager

677
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,199
to keep playing as we are.

678
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,036
Now, in this round,

679
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,706
you will each get 30 seconds

680
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,208
in order to make your decision,
all right?

681
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,711
So let's begin with...

682
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,837
Iris.

683
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:22,009
Iris, would you rather...

684
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,514
Stab Cal in the thigh

685
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:27,932
with an ice pick...

686
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,100
What?

687
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,436
Or...

688
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:35,064
strike Travis three times

689
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,067
with this
African whipping staff,

690
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,777
a sjambok?

691
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,446
Oh, my God.

692
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,531
They're gonna kill us!

693
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,699
Look, Iris,

694
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,869
three whacks from that,
I'll be okay.

695
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,496
If I stab him,
I could kill him, right?

696
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,665
And it's only three.

697
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,959
It's gonna hurt, though, man.

698
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,502
I know.
Let's just get it over with.

699
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,422
The clock is ticking.

700
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,140
Sjambok it is.

701
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,395
Now, Iris,

702
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,898
you have to put
your back into this?

703
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,858
There's no just tapping him.

704
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,276
That doesn't count.

705
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,781
And Travis,

706
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,282
this is going to hurt,

707
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,619
so make yourself comfortable.

708
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,998
Like this, ma'am.

709
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,625
Across the back.

710
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,424
Travis?

711
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,134
Go ahead, Iris.

712
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,727
No. No, no, no, no, no.

713
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,062
That won't count.

714
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,950
Fuck.

715
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,120
All right.

716
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,543
That looked like it hurt,
Travis.

717
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,044
Well, it did.

718
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,630
Are you okay?

719
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,131
I've been through worse.

720
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,843
Lucas.

721
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,303
You're next.

722
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:32,974
Would you rather
stab Iris in the thigh...

723
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,143
Or...

724
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,481
Give Travis three more strikes?

725
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:43,150
Oh, come on!

726
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,296
Look, it's a really dangerous
place to stab somebody.

727
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,715
There's a major artery there.

728
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,758
You know what I'm saying?

729
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:08,968
I do.

730
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,303
Let's just get it over with.

731
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,020
The sjambok again.

732
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,131
Sorry, man.

733
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,142
Travis...

734
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,897
You're probably relieved
to find out

735
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,231
that it's your turn.

736
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,275
Something like that.

737
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,485
All right, then.

738
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,320
Let's get it over with.

739
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,155
Travis...

740
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,492
Would you rather...

741
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:16,911
Stab Lucas,

742
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,997
the man who just whipped you,

743
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,082
or...

744
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,250
drumroll, please...

745
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:26,253
Take three more lashes,

746
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:29,548
this time
administered by Bevans?

747
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,594
Ser...seriously, man.

748
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:34,804
I can't...

749
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,013
I can't do this anymore.

750
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,035
I wonder why
you're being singled out.

751
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,108
What the fuck is the matter
with you people?

752
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,361
What did I ever do to you,

753
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,573
What?

754
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,623
That's... that's what I thought.

755
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,292
Travis, we need a decision.

756
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,004
Yeah.

757
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,297
Yeah, fucking whip.

758
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,799
I'm not stabbing anybody.

759
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,514
We have to stop this.
We have to.

760
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,974
Yeah, wait.

761
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,059
Wait, stop...stop.

762
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,438
Travis, just stab me
in the thigh, okay?

763
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,480
We can't watch this go on.

764
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,566
I'm not stabbing anybody.

765
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,608
Travis, come on.

766
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,944
Lucas, this is admirable,

767
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,237
but it's against the rules.

768
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,697
But I'm okay with it.

769
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,532
He can't go back.
His first choice is final.

770
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,616
Just hold on a second.

771
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:38,617
I said I'm okay with it!

772
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,952
It's okay.

773
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:40,995
Come on.

774
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,538
- Lucas.
- It's okay.

775
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,540
This is all very admirable.

776
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,167
His decision.

777
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,840
It's okay.

778
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,014
It's just like life, isn't it?

779
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,268
There's no do-overs.

780
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,748
Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis.

781
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,124
Hey, hey, hey.

782
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,836
He's in trouble.

783
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,338
He needs medical attention.

784
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,992
Peter...

785
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,246
I'm awfully sorry,

786
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,914
but I'm afraid it's your turn.

787
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,335
You know the drill by now.

788
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,255
The pick

789
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,757
or give Travis three more.

790
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,472
If I do the pick,
who does it have to be?

791
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,935
I'm sure you've already
worked the angles on that one,

792
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,103
haven't you?

793
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,565
Well...

794
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,193
I don't want to stab a lady.

795
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,653
I'm not Mr. Manners
or anything,

796
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:41,031
but I think there's some common
decency considerations here.

797
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,451
30 seconds.

798
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:49,123
On the other hand,
Travis is in real bad shape.

799
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,292
We can't really hit him anymore,
can we?

800
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,461
Honestly, Linda,

801
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,963
you're paralyzed, right?

802
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,092
Your leg wouldn't feel this
anyway.

803
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,428
No, please.

804
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,389
If I whip him with this thing,
he's going to die.

805
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,558
And haven't we all
been saying this whole time

806
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,226
that we have to work together?

807
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,148
Well, unfortunately,

808
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:17,359
you're gonna have to take one
for the team, Linda.

809
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,278
I'm sorry.

810
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,655
You're gonna be okay,
I promise.

811
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:22,823
Just close your eyes.

812
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:27,494
In and then out, okay?

813
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,913
Don't push it too far.

814
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,457
Fuck.

815
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,174
- Oh, shit.
- Holy crap.

816
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,342
I think I hit that artery.

817
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,509
Do you have a belt?

818
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,511
Tie it. Tie it. Hurry.

819
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,721
What happened?

820
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,432
You're okay. You're okay.

821
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,395
Can we not take her to
a hospital or something here?

822
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,521
This isn't good.

823
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,690
People, we're playing a game.

824
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,318
Linda, it's your turn.

825
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:03,447
Now, would you rather
whip Travis

826
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:06,784
or give your neighbor Amy
down there

827
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,745
the old in and out?

828
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,247
What?

829
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,915
Can we not give her a sec?

830
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,750
Peter, what's going on, man?

831
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,961
Is the tourniquet supposed
to go above or below the wound?

832
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,212
- Above, above!
- Okay, okay.

833
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,255
My God, tighten it!

834
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,464
- I got it. I got it.
- Tighter!

835
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,258
Linda has not
made a decision yet.

836
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,635
Linda!

837
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,553
Travis or...

838
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,222
Bitch!

839
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,015
You fucking scratched me.

840
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:36,689
Linda.

841
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,023
Stupendous.

842
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,402
But then, come to think of it,

843
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,071
she didn't have another choice.

844
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,573
She couldn't whip Travis
even if she wanted to.

845
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,741
She can't walk.

846
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,745
So let's...

847
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,706
change things up
a little bit here.

848
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:54,790
Amy...

849
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,337
Would you rather
whip Travis or...

850
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:04,967
Stab any player
of your choosing?

851
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,685
In case any of y'all
haven't figured this out yet,

852
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,521
this game isn't about
helpin' each other.

853
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,816
It's about eliminating
the rest of you.

854
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,486
Bevans...

855
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,450
This one's probably gonna
bleed to death.

856
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,747
You're okay.

857
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,002
Duck.

858
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,505
Duck.

859
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,636
Goose.

860
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,096
Hey, hold on a second.

861
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,265
Okay, okay.

862
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,641
She's made her decision.

863
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,269
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.

864
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,771
Can I stab her anywhere?

865
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,066
Well, that's a new one.

866
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,990
Just from the shoulders down.

867
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:12,409
No!

868
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,080
Let me see. Let me see.

869
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,873
Can you breathe?

870
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,127
I think she missed the lung.

871
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,729
Put some pressure on it.
Can you breathe?

872
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:25,923
Tighter.

873
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,677
Tight.

874
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:31,762
Travis?

875
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,766
Bevans.

876
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,916
Still breathing, sir.

877
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,084
Remarkable.

878
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,756
Guys, she hasn't moved
for a while.

879
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,259
Stabbed an old woman, Peter.

880
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:54,761
Linda.

881
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,221
See, she's unconscious.

882
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,977
She's not unconscious.

883
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,520
She's dead.

884
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,033
You guys saw what happened,
right?

885
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,659
I tried to help her.

886
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,245
Oh, yes, Peter,
we all saw what happened.

887
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,749
You made a decision.

888
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,083
There was a consequence.

889
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,213
And now...

890
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:32,716
Cal is the one
to make a choice.

891
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:41,683
Finish off Travis here or...

892
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,977
stab Lucas.

893
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,146
Stab Lucas like the others?

894
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,981
Like Linda,
that's what you're saying?

895
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,192
30 seconds.

896
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:54,321
Okay, come on.
Let's get it over with.

897
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:58,075
Maybe Amy is right.

898
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,911
Eliminate a player.

899
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,371
That's what this is about.

900
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,331
No, Cal, Amy's crazy.

901
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,916
Well, maybe he wants
to end it too.

902
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,835
That's not your choice
to make, man.

903
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:09,920
But it is.

904
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,174
They're making it my choice.

905
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:16,343
Cal, come on, I'm giving you
an opening here!

906
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,344
Time.

907
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,720
Okay, I choose...

908
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,515
God, no, Cal. Don't do this.

909
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,267
- Don't do that.
- You can't do this.

910
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:27,020
No.

911
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,274
It's murder.

912
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,358
Don't look.

913
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,735
Oh, Jesus.

914
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,705
Nicely done.

915
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,677
And now...

916
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,722
On to the next round.

917
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,058
It had to be done, right?

918
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,062
Right?

919
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,981
You didn't have to do that.

920
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,109
So how long would you say?

921
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,986
He may live for several
more hours, days even.

922
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,321
I don't know.

923
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,905
But he's in no shape
to continue play.

924
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,282
That much is certain.

925
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,827
All right, let's move him out.

926
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,914
Ladies and gentlemen,

927
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,416
I regret to inform you

928
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:32,044
that Travis is unable
to continue playing.

929
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,378
Aww...

930
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,507
Do not do that.

931
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:40,552
Keep your sarcasm to yourself.

932
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,980
I'm thinking...

933
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,650
We don't have much time here
with these delays.

934
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:02,366
We have 21/2 hours left.

935
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,368
Is that enough for us to...

936
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,119
Can you run?

937
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:12,959
Now!

938
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,144
Iris, run.

939
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,328
Get back!

940
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:56,211
All right,
everyone back to the table.

941
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,046
Get up. Everyone, get up.

942
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,464
Julian, get up on your...

943
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,802
Back to your seats.

944
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,095
Well...

945
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:08,181
That was some unexpected
excitement, wasn't it?

946
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,349
Everyone sit down.

947
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,517
Where's Iris?

948
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,852
- What?
- Iris!

949
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,020
Bevans!

950
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,856
The door was unlocked?

951
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,692
Stay here! Keep an eye on them!

952
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,611
Bring her back to the game!

953
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:22,654
I should help him.

954
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,656
Fine, go, go.

955
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,450
Remember what we spoke about.

956
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:31,288
I believe I said sit down.

957
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:58,518
Little pig tried to run away,
didn't she?

958
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,353
What? You gonna go tell on us?

959
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:03,273
Well, no one
is gonna believe you, okay?

960
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,275
No one.

961
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:17,996
Iris.

962
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Get back.
I'm getting you out of here.
I made a mistake.
I should've just told...

963
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:32,719
Shoot her, Bevans!

964
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,721
She attacked me!

965
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:43,730
Your father
will be disappointed.

966
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:47,067
After all she did,
she doesn't get punished?

967
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,902
I need to take her back
to the game.

968
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,156
Take him upstairs
and leave him there.

969
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:55,116
I'll inform his father.

970
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,412
I'm sorry, Iris,

971
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:01,456
but we're not through playing.

972
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:19,516
Welcome back, Iris.

973
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:24,646
Bevans, what took so long?

974
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:25,981
Where's Julian?

975
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,944
Your son tried to rape Iris.

976
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,028
- She...
- What?

977
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,279
Stabbed him in the thigh.

978
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,572
He's been taken upstairs, sir.

979
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:37,075
Let me handle that.

980
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,953
Excuse me for a moment,
everyone.

981
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,581
Lock that behind me.

982
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:47,961
Where's Cal?

983
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,215
They shot him.

984
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,517
You gonna be okay, Iris?

985
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:05,770
Iris, talk to me.

986
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,439
How far did you get?
Is there a way out?

987
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,024
Do you all get it now?

988
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,234
They're not gonna let us
just leave.

989
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,237
She's right.

990
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:16,156
She's absolutely right.

991
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,005
Iris...

992
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:36,801
I am dreadfully sorry

993
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:38,970
for what took place
in the basement.

994
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:44,100
Since the loss of his mother,

995
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:47,687
my son lacks...

996
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,566
Restraint.

997
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,194
Well, please.

998
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:59,657
My apologies.

999
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:00,867
All right.

1000
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,786
Let's continue.

1001
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,205
That's it?

1002
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:07,540
Why is this bitch allowed
to stay in the game?

1003
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:10,710
You're lucky
you didn't get us all killed.

1004
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:11,920
Crazy girl has a point.

1005
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,130
This is my game.

1006
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:16,132
I make the decisions here.

1007
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:19,219
Keep your petulant mouth shut.

1008
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,303
She will play.

1009
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,721
The game will continue.

1010
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:23,932
Final.

1011
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:24,974
Now...

1012
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:29,687
My son, Julian,
is unable to continue.

1013
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:30,730
What a shame.

1014
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:32,941
Excuse me?

1015
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,902
Thank you.

1016
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:39,906
So on to the next round.

1017
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:42,909
Now,

1018
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,577
when all of you were deciding

1019
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:48,081
whether or not to accept
our invitation to play the game,

1020
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:50,250
you were, in essence,
making a choice

1021
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:53,419
between the known
and the unknown.

1022
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:57,090
You could continue to deal
with your problems, the known,

1023
01:08:57,091 --> 01:09:02,595
or possibly solve your problems
in the unknown,

1024
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:03,805
our game.

1025
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:08,518
This round
uses that same concept.

1026
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:23,950
What's this for?
Are you gonna let us clean up?

1027
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,619
No, Peter. I'm sorry.

1028
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,454
The barrel of water
is for the next round.

1029
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:35,295
Envelopes are being placed
randomly in front of you.

1030
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:39,465
They each contain a card
with a punishment on them...

1031
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:41,134
some of them quite harsh,

1032
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:44,637
others relatively harmless.

1033
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:49,434
You must decide between
what lies inside the envelope

1034
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,853
or the barrel.

1035
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:56,441
The known or the unknown.

1036
01:09:57,776 --> 01:09:59,277
What's with the barrel?

1037
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:00,904
Two minutes.

1038
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:02,655
Two minutes held underwater.

1039
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:04,490
That's the barrel.

1040
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:10,163
And you will have 30 seconds
in this round

1041
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:11,247
to make your decision.

1042
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:12,874
Let's begin, shall we?

1043
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:13,875
Peter.

1044
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,627
Fuck.

1045
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,462
We will begin with you.

1046
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,255
So what will it be?

1047
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:22,175
The barrel

1048
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:27,096
or what is in that envelope?

1049
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:29,557
Well, I already know
what I'm choosing.

1050
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:32,018
Do you? Really?

1051
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:33,686
Do tell.

1052
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:35,355
This is gambling 101
right here.

1053
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,357
You just got to look
for the patterns.

1054
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,025
It's all patterns.
It's psychology.

1055
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:44,447
And drowning
does sound pretty bad.

1056
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:48,117
So I'm guessing you think
I'm gonna choose the envelope

1057
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:49,786
to avoid Duggins
holding me underwater

1058
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,120
for two minutes and drowning.

1059
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:52,956
Is that it?

1060
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,165
Bevans.

1061
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,541
Whatever.

1062
01:10:57,461 --> 01:10:58,878
If you were facing
a normal player,

1063
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:00,922
that's exactly what you'd do...

1064
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,758
put something really shitty
in that envelope

1065
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:07,178
so all the other players
think twice.

1066
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:08,513
But I know you.

1067
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,265
You've looked into my past.

1068
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,433
So you know all about
my gambling experience.

1069
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,687
So you probably
have anticipated

1070
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,230
that I was gonna
figure this out.

1071
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:19,065
Come on, come on, come on.
Make a decision.

1072
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:20,233
Your time is running out.

1073
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,193
The envelope.

1074
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:23,278
Obviously.

1075
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,033
And the envelope says?

1076
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:37,000
What is this?

1077
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:44,632
You have to light off
a firecracker in your hand.

1078
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:45,800
That's it.

1079
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:48,386
Good.

1080
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,265
See?

1081
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:55,476
Gambling 101.

1082
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:56,769
Why are you
pointing a gun in my face?

1083
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:57,770
I'm agreeing to this.

1084
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,278
What the hell is this?

1085
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:06,779
You have to light it, Peter.

1086
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,614
It's what the envelope says.

1087
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:09,782
But it's not a firecracker.

1088
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:12,285
That's a quarter stick.

1089
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:14,162
You know, you're right.

1090
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,872
Maybe you ought to move away
from the table.

1091
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,373
You're gonna make an awful mess.

1092
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:20,460
Let it go before it goes off.

1093
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:21,627
Don't hold it too tight.

1094
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,629
No, he must hold it tight.

1095
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,548
Bevans?

1096
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:28,259
Secure it to his hand,
if you would, please.

1097
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:33,973
Oh, fuck.

1098
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,488
You know, Peter,
maybe it's a dud.

1099
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:49,864
Did you think about that?

1100
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,407
Did you consider that?

1101
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:53,993
But, of course,
we won't know that

1102
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:56,329
until you light the fuse.

1103
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:00,750
Use the lighter!

1104
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,502
And light the fuse!

1105
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,628
Now!

1106
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:08,049
If this is a dud,
do I have to go again?

1107
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:11,302
Nah.

1108
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1109
01:13:22,272 --> 01:13:23,689
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

1110
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:24,857
Oh, my God.

1111
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,781
That was loud.

1112
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,283
We're lucky
we didn't break any windows.

1113
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:36,202
Let's see what we have.

1114
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,708
I think he's having
a heart attack, sir.

1115
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:43,793
Really?

1116
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:48,089
Peter?

1117
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,799
- Peter?
- Peter.

1118
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:54,887
Now he's dead.

1119
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:02,937
Oh, well.

1120
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,412
Lucas.

1121
01:14:20,914 --> 01:14:21,998
It's your turn.

1122
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:23,833
So what is it,

1123
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,419
the barrel or the card?

1124
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,422
What would you rather do?

1125
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:35,428
Two minutes held underwater.

1126
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:40,892
I don't think I can do that.

1127
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,393
I don't think I can.

1128
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:48,774
We're running out of time here.

1129
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:51,777
No.

1130
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:53,946
I'll take my chances
with the card.

1131
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:55,448
Okay.

1132
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:04,582
What do we have?

1133
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,172
What is it?

1134
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,924
- Oh, well, that's...
- What...what is it?

1135
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,884
This...this is...

1136
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:18,471
Is very interesting.

1137
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:21,474
You must...

1138
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:24,810
Slit open your eye.

1139
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,772
You can use this mirror,

1140
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,482
if it helps.

1141
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:30,650
No.

1142
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,485
- That's it.
- That's it?

1143
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,987
No, that's not it.
No, I can't do this.

1144
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:36,656
- Lucas.
- I can't.

1145
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,783
You made your decision.

1146
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,993
This is how the game is played.

1147
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:42,787
Pick up the razor blade.

1148
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:46,999
Please.

1149
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:52,630
- Pick it up.
- Please don't.

1150
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:54,257
You sick fuck!

1151
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,342
I will give you...

1152
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:58,678
30 seconds to do this.

1153
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:01,681
I can't do that!

1154
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,516
30 seconds.

1155
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,351
I can't do it!

1156
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:07,353
- 30 seconds to do it...
- I can't do it.

1157
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:09,188
- Or Bevans...
- I can't do it!

1158
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:10,356
Will dispatch you.

1159
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:12,024
Do you understand?

1160
01:16:12,025 --> 01:16:15,027
And by the way, you can pick
whichever eye you want.

1161
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:16,696
It's completely up to you.

1162
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:18,364
Go.

1163
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:28,332
20 seconds.

1164
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:29,375
Fuck!

1165
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,424
I can't do it.

1166
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:40,136
10 seconds.

1167
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,220
Listen, Lucas,

1168
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:43,264
he will eliminate you,

1169
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,265
I am telling you.

1170
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:47,435
Five, four, three,

1171
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,645
two, one.

1172
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:54,984
There.

1173
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:56,652
All done.

1174
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:03,909
Iris.

1175
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:06,203
Are you interested in seeing
what's in your envelope?

1176
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,251
No.

1177
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:13,502
Oh, of course.

1178
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,922
You're not the gambling type,
are you?

1179
01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:18,883
Oh, no, no, no.

1180
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:21,260
No, you prefer the sure thing.

1181
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:30,603
Thank you.

1182
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:32,772
Lovely.

1183
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:34,106
So...

1184
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,818
Two minutes, yes?

1185
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:40,863
Go.

1186
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,019
I keep having this dream

1187
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,980
that I'm on a boat.

1188
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:17,149
Suddenly, the boat

1189
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:20,986
tips over and throws me
into the water.

1190
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:25,408
You and all these people
are pinned under it...

1191
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,452
And you're drowning.

1192
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:30,454
Come on, come on.

1193
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:32,123
And I keep trying
to pull myself up,

1194
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,833
but the more and more I do...

1195
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:39,505
The more the boat
comes down with me.

1196
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:40,840
And you are trying
to grab my hand,

1197
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,341
trying to help me,

1198
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:47,096
but we're sinking faster
and faster and faster until...

1199
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:51,016
I just finally...

1200
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:00,443
Yes!

1201
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,528
Two minutes!

1202
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,614
Iris!

1203
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:07,867
Very impressive.

1204
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:09,285
You know,

1205
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:12,455
this is designed
to actually drown people.

1206
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,625
What was in her card?

1207
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:20,087
I have no idea.

1208
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:23,549
Find out.

1209
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,676
Set of lungs.

1210
01:19:35,395 --> 01:19:37,897
That was a close call, Iris.

1211
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:40,149
All your teeth extracted.

1212
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:43,652
Sorry, Bevans, maybe next year.

1213
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:47,239
Is Amy ready?

1214
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:53,245
So how long
can you hold your breath, Amy?

1215
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,125
How long did it
take your husband

1216
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:00,795
to hold your little girl

1217
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,129
while he drowned her?

1218
01:20:12,265 --> 01:20:14,225
What is this?

1219
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:17,019
It's another barrel,

1220
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,354
with a four.

1221
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:19,980
And that four stands for...

1222
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:23,692
Four minutes.

1223
01:20:23,693 --> 01:20:24,860
That isn't possible.

1224
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:26,862
No, technically,
it is possible.

1225
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:29,365
Not even close to
the world record, by the way.

1226
01:20:35,288 --> 01:20:38,624
Well, I guess...

1227
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:40,793
beggars can't be choosers.

1228
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:46,298
I guess so.

1229
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,139
Four minutes.

1230
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:56,392
Ready, Bevans?

1231
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:00,521
Go.

1232
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:01,814
She wasn't ready!

1233
01:21:56,786 --> 01:21:59,204
At the beginning of the night,

1234
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:02,875
I would have pegged her
as the odds-on favorite to win.

1235
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:03,959
You never know, sir.

1236
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,678
And then there were two.

1237
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:21,769
Iris, I would like for you
to sit across from Lucas,

1238
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,103
if you would, please.

1239
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:28,442
Thank you.

1240
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:45,000
We're in the final stretch now.

1241
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:49,672
Now...

1242
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:51,507
Before we begin
the final round,

1243
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:54,510
I'd like to say a few words,
if I may.

1244
01:22:55,762 --> 01:23:00,432
I know that this evening
has been difficult.

1245
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:03,060
For all of us, really.

1246
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:07,898
But it has also been one
for the books.

1247
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:10,109
And I speak not only for myself

1248
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:13,570
but for Bevans and his staff
and the entire Lambrick family

1249
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:15,155
when I say,

1250
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,825
well played, both of you.

1251
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:21,829
Personally, I'd be happy
if either one of you won.

1252
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:24,915
Truly.

1253
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:32,673
To the final round, then.

1254
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:36,260
Now, in all likelihood,

1255
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:37,636
the game will end

1256
01:23:37,637 --> 01:23:40,305
with the very first question
in this round.

1257
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:43,308
We have found
that the player who goes first

1258
01:23:43,309 --> 01:23:44,810
in the final round

1259
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:49,356
has a decided advantage.

1260
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:53,527
Therefore, we will flip a coin.

1261
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:56,155
Bevans.

1262
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:58,824
Heads, Iris.

1263
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:00,492
Tails, Lucas.

1264
01:24:00,493 --> 01:24:01,994
Bevans, if you would, please.

1265
01:24:12,088 --> 01:24:14,548
Heads it is.

1266
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:18,260
Iris...

1267
01:24:18,261 --> 01:24:19,553
you're up.

1268
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,141
The final question.

1269
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:29,480
Would you rather,

1270
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:32,232
A...

1271
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:34,568
end the game right now,

1272
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:40,074
you and Lucas free to leave,

1273
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,034
empty-handed

1274
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:43,494
but alive.

1275
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:48,582
Or B...

1276
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,670
With this dueling pistol

1277
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:56,131
with a single round
in its chamber...

1278
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:04,973
Eliminate Lucas,

1279
01:25:04,974 --> 01:25:07,184
claim victory

1280
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:09,853
and salvation for your brother.

1281
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,110
Which?

1282
01:25:18,863 --> 01:25:20,531
Iris.

1283
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:23,242
Iris.

1284
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:25,452
It's over.

1285
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:28,831
We're done. We can...

1286
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,083
We can go home.

1287
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:40,425
Iris,

1288
01:25:40,426 --> 01:25:42,719
I never told you why

1289
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,138
I came here tonight.

1290
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:47,474
I think you should hear it,
okay?

1291
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:54,273
I think we have
some things in common.

1292
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,651
You're here for someone else,
right?

1293
01:25:59,362 --> 01:26:00,529
Your brother.

1294
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'll bet you'd do anything
for him.
I know exactly how you feel.
I have three sisters...

1295
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:28,307
We have a winner.

1296
01:26:33,062 --> 01:26:34,521
Brava!

1297
01:26:36,232 --> 01:26:37,608
Bravo!

1298
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:46,992
Bravo!

1299
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:03,342
This is yours.

1300
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:07,429
There should be enough in there
to cover any debts

1301
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:09,806
that your parents
left behind you,

1302
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:12,100
plus enough for you
to go back to school.

1303
01:27:14,854 --> 01:27:19,524
We had previously located
a suitable donor in Romania.

1304
01:27:19,525 --> 01:27:22,527
Arrangements are already
being made as we speak,

1305
01:27:22,528 --> 01:27:24,529
and your brother will be
undergoing the procedure

1306
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:26,365
before the week is out.

1307
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:28,867
You see?

1308
01:27:28,868 --> 01:27:30,202
We keep our word.

1309
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:38,126
I believe a "thank you"
is in order.

1310
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:44,883
Thank you, Mr. Lambrick.

1311
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:47,219
Oh, please.

1312
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:49,304
No, no, no, call me Shep.

1313
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:57,265
Raleigh.

1314
01:29:57,266 --> 01:29:58,683
Oh, my God.

1315
01:29:58,684 --> 01:30:01,645
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1316
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:02,854
What did you do?

1317
01:30:02,855 --> 01:30:04,981
What did you do?

1318
01:30:04,982 --> 01:30:07,150
Oh, my God.

1319
01:30:07,151 --> 01:30:09,569
What did you do?
