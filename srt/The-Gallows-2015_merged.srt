1
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,929
Could you make,
uh, a copy for us as well?

2
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,408
I'll have to figure out how
to do this when it's all done. I'm just...

3
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,291
Jean was not happy, because, boy,
was this thing expensive.

4
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,966
Oh, August. What shall we do?

5
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,687
Don't worry, Mary. He wants me.

6
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,244
He's coming for me and no one else.
Do you understand?

7
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,444
August, I'm frightened.

8
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,086
I know, Mary.

9
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,770
Art thou afraid?

10
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,249
Charlie's doing such a good job.

11
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,646
I am no more.

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,850
Yeah, I'm really surprised considering
the last-minute change, but it looks good.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,206
Kiss me.

14
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,926
No, please don't.
Please don't do it, August. Please.

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,890
Do you know what they're doing
for the spring play, by any chance?

16
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,844
No, I have no idea. Uh...

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,680
They did a great job on the gallows.

18
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,485
For crimes against
the township of Bedford...

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,607
including robbery...

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,246
perjury...

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,801
adultery...

22
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,327
and fraternizing with a noble...

23
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,404
I hereby sentence you...

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
August Benjamin Rutherford...
to death...
by hanging on this 29th day...

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,610
Charlie? Charlie?

26
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,211
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

27
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,771
Oh, my God.

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,767
Grab him! Grab him!

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,891
Get a doctor!

30
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,964
He's not breathing! Get a doctor!

31
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,285
Lights up.

32
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,688
All right. Let's nail this, guys.

33
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,045
Heh, yeah.

34
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,248
Let's nail this, Mr. Schwendiman.

35
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,766
You got it.

36
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,449
Oh, August, you came.

37
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,721
Oh.

38
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,610
Don't worry, my love.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,490
He's coming for... He wants me.

40
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,847
Project nice and loud
to the back, please.

41
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,890
- Come on, Reese.
- He wants me.

42
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,324
He's coming for me.

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,884
Is she gonna throw up?

44
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,168
Dost thou understand?

45
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,526
Thou...

46
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,785
Thou shall be safe here?

47
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,451
Oh, August...

48
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,244
for I am frightened.

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,931
Art thou?

50
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,410
Dig deep. Find those tears.

51
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,930
Not anymore.

52
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,681
Oh, what...?

53
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,966
Heh, dude.

54
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,205
August...

55
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,084
just give me one last kiss.

56
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,209
Is he gonna do it this time?

57
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,685
Here it is, bro.

58
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,241
Pucker up for that theater nerd.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,721
- Cut.
- Oh.

60
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,061
- Reese.
- Yeah?

61
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,087
Nice job, dude.

62
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,044
- Pfeifer, great job.
- Thank you.

63
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,407
Everyone else, that was good.

64
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,001
God, she's obnoxious.

65
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,568
- A little more work on the lines, Reese.
- Yeah, you need to work on them.

66
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,764
You need a little bit more work
on them before tomorrow night.

67
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,123
- Yeah, take a moment right now.
- Oh. The play is tomorrow.

68
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,885
Just go over those pages again.

69
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,050
Wow. Jesus.

70
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,966
Oh, Reese,
you're breaking my poor heart.

71
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,884
Oh, this is good.

72
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,041
For those of you watching along at home,
that is why football players do not do drama.

73
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,931
Ryan. You're supposed
to stay in the booth.

74
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,201
No.

75
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,210
Hey, Reese.
Can I borrow your blouse? Heh.

76
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,768
Why, man? I need some clarity, bro.
Help me out here.

77
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,127
Isn't this embarrassing, dude?

78
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,090
Like, you're choking worse
than Charlie did.

79
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,331
Dude, they're gonna tear you apart
in here. Don't do it.

80
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,681
Don't bring the camera in.

81
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,042
This is more booby
than the girl locker room.

82
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,090
This isn't the girls'.
Who brings a camera into the men's room?

83
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,044
Oh, my God. Get that shit out of here.

84
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,050
That's disgusting.
No one wants to see that.

85
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,948
- My boy's gonna be a superstar.
- Yes.

86
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,648
- Look at those tights, Peter Pan.
- Are you serious?

87
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,009
- Why can't you just stay up in the booth?
- The booth camera sucks.

88
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,130
That's why I have my camera.
Besides, I have practice.

89
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,204
Come on. You could have done shop.
You could have done Home Ec.

90
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,761
You're wearing knickers, bro. Come on.

91
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,248
Reese. Knickers, dude.

92
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,246
- Stop walking. I'll find you, Reese.
- Hey, big shot. Get suited up. Let's go.

93
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,881
There's Miss Shannon.

94
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,247
Do you still have a husband,
Miss Shannon?

95
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,802
- Goodbye.
- Love you too.

96
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,731
And another one up.

97
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,000
Cassidy.

98
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,921
Ryan. Come on.

99
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,407
Cassidy. What are you doing?

100
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,722
Told you not to mess with this.
It's not a toy.

101
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,967
Don't "pfft" me.

102
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,208
So, what's it like being a drama techie?

103
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,044
- Such a bitch. Are you kidding?
- Whoa!

104
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,288
What? If I had known
there was a drama requirement...

105
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,441
I love it. I love it.

106
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,660
I get to hang out with the most unattractive
girls. I'm late to practice every day.

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,729
- How's drama?
- Oh, how's drama?

108
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,043
- How is it with all your little drama buddies?
- At least I'm not around you.

109
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,851
- Are you trying to defend your drama buddies?
- Well, your mom.

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,729
- Hey, big shot.
- Yes, coach?

111
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,531
- Practice? Hello.
- Yeah, Ryan.

112
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,850
Let's go, big shot.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,526
- There they are.
- There's your buddies right there.

114
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,809
They're not my buddies.
Take this. Take this thing, man.

115
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,801
Watch this.

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,650
Oh, my God. Oh, no.

117
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,871
It's up. It's up.

118
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,250
Go get the trainer.

119
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,925
- Nailed it.
- Vicious.

120
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,208
Right in the schnoz, dude.

121
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,681
- Yo, David, how you doing?
- Hey, what's happening?

122
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,729
- Working late tonight?
- You know it.

123
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,201
- Time for a vacation, huh?
- You guessed that too.

124
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,201
And here's the 1993 cast.

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,570
Just as geeky as now.

126
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,889
And there he is.

127
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,930
Charlie Grimille.

128
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,963
Unbelievably morbid that they still
have a picture of him up here.

129
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,080
Don't forget your costume.

130
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,925
Chris, turn off the cell phones, please.

131
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,731
In the drama room as well
as the theater. That's the rule.

132
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,570
Turn them off or be suspended.

133
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,484
No cell phone, okay?

134
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,846
No cell phones.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,287
All right. Now, listen up.
Eyes forward, everyone.

136
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,929
Tomorrow night is the show.
It's been a long process.

137
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,447
- Not always easy, right, Pfeifer?
- Mm-hm.

138
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,889
Uh, especially not with the school board,
but we got through that.

139
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,641
But, um, I think we're gonna do okay.

140
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,921
Pfeifer, you had a couple of words
you wanted to say.

141
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,606
- Of course she has something to say.
- Thank you, guys.

142
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,730
First off, I would like you guys
to take a peek at the programs.

143
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,645
They're done and they are identical
to the 1993 ones.

144
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,406
- Oh, my God. Thank God.
- So thank you, Brittany, heh.

145
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,282
Thank you guys so much for helping me
make this show possible.

146
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,683
We've worked so hard.
We've had such a great time.

147
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,280
I feel so proud to be
a part of The Gallows. Um...

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,243
- I just can't wait to see it finally finished.
- Me neither.

149
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,087
So thank you, guys.

150
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,765
Thank you, Pfeifer.

151
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,961
Our assistant director, Pfeifer Ross,
everyone. And what do we say?

152
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,771
- Break a leg.
- Break a leg, Reese.

153
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,922
Thank you, guys. Let's go.

154
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,690
Backstage.

155
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,650
- Shoos. Mr. BHS.
- What's up, my man?

156
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,165
Oh, look at this.

157
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,607
- What are you doing here?
- My favorite characters.

158
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,250
Peasant Number Five, Hangman.

159
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,561
You guys even have lines?

160
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,722
- I think I clap or something.
- There you go.

161
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,969
If Coach could see you guys now,
you'd be kicked off in a second.

162
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,920
- Yeah, get that camera out of here, man.
- It's a mandatory class, man.

163
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,050
- Thanks for bringing this stuff.
- It's like Halloween down here.

164
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,202
- Yeah, most definitely.
- Yeah, party cen...

165
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,888
What do we have here?
What is this thing?

166
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,441
- That's the old Hangman costume.
- Looks pretty dumb.

167
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,525
- Some kid told us not to touch it.
- Did a little drama nerd tell you not to touch it?

168
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,011
I think he told me too.

169
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,687
But then I didn't listen to him
because I'm such a badass.

170
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,888
Dan and Mark,
can I see you guys up on stage?

171
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,041
- Ryan.
- Yeah?

172
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,605
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

173
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,764
- I know you don't take any of this seriously.
- I don't.

174
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,169
I'm sorry. No, I will.

175
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,721
- Okay. It's important to a lot of people.
- All right.

176
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,605
- So show a little respect in the theater, okay?
- All right.

177
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,886
- Got it?
- Yeah.

178
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,280
Thank you.

179
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,971
Yeah, right.

180
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,528
Look at him in those khakis.

181
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,887
What a joke.

182
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,565
- I'm fine.
- What are you doing?

183
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,166
I don't know.
Just trying to get through this thing.

184
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,926
- Heh, what are you doing?
- What?

185
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,043
Oh, I'm Charlie. I'm dead. Oh.

186
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,484
Oh, I got a trick for you guys. Watch.

187
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,005
Watch this.

188
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,681
Ready?

189
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,363
How creepy is that?

190
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,881
God.

191
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,127
Yo, yo, yo. Dude.
Smile for the camera, man.

192
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,207
Oh, come on.

193
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,170
Look, I'm sorry about
hitting you with the football.

194
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,005
You were wide open. Come on.

195
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,447
- Can I at least help you with this stuff?
- No.

196
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,967
And don't touch the fly rigs.
They're dangerous.

197
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,084
Wow. Okay, stage boy.

198
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,927
August is not who he seems he is, Mary.

199
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,731
- To the audience, John.
- Can't you see?

200
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,169
He is pretending to be a noble
that he might win your love.

201
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,561
He should turn himself in.
He must be hanged.

202
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,963
August will not turn himself in.
He loves me.

203
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,407
But, sir, the hangman
will take Mary in his place.

204
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,971
His sentence is death.

205
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,971
- Nerd, heh.
- What shall I do?

206
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,765
What shall I do, Father?

207
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,206
Reese, come on.

208
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,082
- Now, Reese.
- What shall I do, Father?

209
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,924
- Reese.
- There he is.

210
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,447
- Heh, Good timing, Reese.
- Don't come out with the book.

211
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,809
"What shall I do?" And then you come in.

212
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,930
The parents of the nerds.
There they are.

213
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,940
And look at these guys.

214
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,528
Contain your excitement, gentlemen.

215
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,007
I don't even know
if this lady's a parent.

216
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,889
She's here literally every day.

217
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,849
Sits in the same spot.

218
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,766
- Wait, so you were in the old show?
- The original show.

219
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,729
- Like, the original?
- Yep. I was there.

220
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,006
What was that like?

221
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,369
Heh, I don't know if you ever recover
from something like this.

222
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,721
It was...

223
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,567
horrifying.

224
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,041
The students were upset.
The teachers were upset.

225
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,328
- Charlie had a girlfriend.
- A girlfriend?

226
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,409
Oh, I didn't really know her...

227
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,600
but, um, she was devastated.

228
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,240
I've been here and things have happened.

229
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,370
Lights have gone on when there was
no one in the lighting booth.

230
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,522
Doors have been opened and shut
and locked.

231
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,763
There's all kinds of stories
around here, mm-hm.

232
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,368
Oh, heh, no, no, no.

233
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,409
They're patty-caking.

234
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,041
He's slapping hands with another dude.

235
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,781
And zero hot girls.

236
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,850
Oh. And the queen.

237
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,061
Not in a million years.

238
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,647
I hate this class.

239
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,849
Hollywood. What's up, brother?

240
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,163
- Hey.
- What are you doing? Practicing?

241
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,971
- Mm-hm.
- Is it working?

242
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,523
Yeah, I didn't think so, heh.

243
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,969
It makes no sense, dude.

244
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,969
I mean, this is torture.

245
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,249
Why don't you just call out sick?
You know? Put an end to this.

246
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,401
I can't call out sick.

247
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,404
I call out sick two-,
three times a week, minimum. Just do it.

248
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,131
I have a responsibility
to these people. I'm the lead.

249
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,045
To what people?
What are you talking about?

250
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,964
A responsibility to these guys?

251
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,281
Come on.

252
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,521
You're just go...

253
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,641
Let me see.

254
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,525
Holy shi...

255
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,650
Reese? Do you like Pfeifer?

256
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,445
- No, Ryan. No.
- You do.

257
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,444
- Don't you? You like Pfeifer.
- Ryan, seriously, no, I don't.

258
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,489
That's why you're doing this?

259
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,722
- Oh, my God. Does she know?
- Ryan.

260
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,689
- She doesn't know.
- I don't... Ryan.

261
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,808
- Your boy's got this, dude.
- Stop it, Ryan.

262
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,167
Talk to Schwendiman.
I got this one, man, heh.

263
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,851
Hey, drama queen.

264
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,530
Hey, hey, hey. Pfeifer.

265
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,920
- Hey, Ryan.
- Wait a second.

266
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,970
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
I need to talk to you about Reese.

267
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,121
What about Reese?

268
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,568
He has a big-ass crush on you.

269
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,127
Like, he wants to be on you.

270
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,965
Pfeifer, please. Talk to me about Reese.

271
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,929
What's going on there?

272
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,606
Um, Reese is gonna do great.
I have complete faith in him.

273
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,047
He knows his lines. He's gonna be fine.

274
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,727
Are you kidding me? Everybody knows
he's gonna choke like Charlie did.

275
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,121
We don't say that name, Ryan.
I've told you that.

276
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,526
- It's bad luck.
- I'm sorry.

277
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,967
I don't get you drama nerds
and your jargon.

278
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,168
It's like "good luck" is bad luck.

279
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,926
- Breaking a leg is supposed to be a good thing?
- Exactly.

280
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,851
And "C'est fini"? What the hell is that?

281
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,169
Oh, my God. Pfeifer, back to the point.

282
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,449
After the show bombs,
how is it gonna affect you and Reese?

283
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,810
The show isn't going to bomb, Ryan, okay?
We're gonna finish the show.

284
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,603
- It's gonna look great.
- Ah.

285
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,280
C'est fi-what? You're from Nebraska.

286
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,010
- Ryan.
- What?

287
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,366
Price needs you.

288
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,686
Who's Price?

289
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,080
The stage manager.

290
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,044
The stage man...?

291
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,687
Stage boy. Yeah.

292
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,285
Hey there, chief.

293
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,805
How you doing, bud?

294
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,450
What can I help you with?

295
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,410
It's Number 28 here.
It's just a little too heavy for me.

296
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,848
- You can do it.
- I probably can, yes.

297
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,366
You just can't, ugh...
It's pretty stuck. Is it this one?

298
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,965
Price got some balls, dude. Ugh.

299
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,846
- You just need it pulled down?
- It's fine if you can't.

300
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,048
- Are you sure it's this one?
- It's this one.

301
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,402
- It's fine if you can't do it.
- I can do it.

302
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,050
It just needs a good pull.

303
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,244
That's gonna leave a mark.

304
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,408
Smile for the camera.

305
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,361
Come here, you sick...

306
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,682
Hey. Stage...

307
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,841
Hey.

308
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,686
Come here, boy.

309
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,922
No, look. Look, it was just a joke.

310
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,360
- We're even.
- It was a joke?

311
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,046
- It was not funny.
- Please don't hurt me. Okay.

312
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,725
- What?
- Stop, Ryan.

313
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,366
- Come on, Price. Come on. Ryan.
- You're lucky, boy.

314
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,010
Ryan, stop.

315
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,208
- We're even.
- No. This isn't over.

316
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,521
Price.

317
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,889
- You okay?
- Yeah.

318
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,447
What?

319
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,371
No way.

320
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,564
Hey, hey, Brooke.

321
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,491
It's Kelly.

322
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,529
Okay. What is up with this door?

323
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,160
It's broken. Everybody knows that.

324
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,403
No.

325
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,921
What?

326
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,286
Reese. Reese.

327
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,291
Dude. Dude, Reese. My man.

328
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,482
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

329
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,961
- What?
- Do you still wanna do this play?

330
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,043
Do you still wanna do this play?

331
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,761
Are you kidding me?

332
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,481
Okay. Listen. I was talking
to Pfeifer and that stupid stage boy...

333
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,802
and I was chasing him,
but I found this door.

334
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,363
I found a door over here that's unlocked.
It never locks. Always open.

335
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,284
What are you guys talking about?

336
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,086
What'd she say?

337
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,044
- Who?
- Pfeifer.

338
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,891
Oh, my God, heh, Reese.
You like Pfeifer?

339
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,528
Reese, this is your chance.
We break into the school tonight.

340
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,650
We come in through that door,
we ruin the set. Ten minutes.

341
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,531
- You don't have to do the play anymore.
- Heh, that's awesome.

342
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,205
Cassidy, please.

343
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,044
What do you think, Reese?

344
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,886
Heh, you're insane, man.

345
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,407
- Reese, it's a great plan.
- No.

346
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,250
- Why not?
- No. Ryan, this is illegal.

347
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,528
Why would you even want to film this?

348
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,162
...bail on the show. If I bail on this
show, they all hate me.

349
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,890
Especially Pfeifer.

350
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,202
And if you don't bail on the show...

351
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,610
you let everyone down
and they all hate you. Especially Pfeifer.

352
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,724
Dude, I'm done.
I'm done sugarcoating this whole thing.

353
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,881
You suck.

354
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,243
You're a terrible actor,
and you need to do something about it.

355
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,846
Why not do something
that's not your fault?

356
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,122
Tear this mother down.

357
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,362
They're gonna come in, they're gonna be like:
"Oh, my God. The set's broken.

358
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,521
What are we gonna do?"

359
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,844
And who's there for Pfeifer to lean on
in her time of need?

360
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,202
Dude, you are.

361
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,530
- It's a win. I'm a freaking genius.
- You're not a genius.

362
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,841
What time?

363
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,530
You're not coming, Cassidy.

364
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,411
- Yes, I'm coming.
- No, you're not. You're a cheerleader.

365
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,403
What does that have to do with anything?

366
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,087
You're a cheerleader
that likes to do other girl-dance stuff...

367
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,568
not cool, awesome, scary stuff
at the school at night.

368
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,682
Ah, I'll pick you up at 9.

369
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,287
Okay. Dude, are you in?

370
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,051
Do you have tools?

371
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,283
Yes, Reese. Yeah. Yeah, I got tools.

372
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,568
God, Reese.
I can't believe you like Pfeifer.

373
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,762
Shut up. Why did you tell her?

374
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

375
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,727
All right.

376
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,881
Between you and me...

377
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,525
- Ryan?
- Mom, what are you doing?

378
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,170
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- What are you...?

379
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,766
What are you doing?
I told you I needed five minutes.

380
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,450
All right, baby. Stay in here.

381
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,409
In and out, babe. Please.

382
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,565
That's what she said.

383
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,923
Trick or treat, Housers.

384
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,923
This play is... Why is it so important?

385
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,811
You don't understand.
I don't want you doing this play.

386
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,928
Why do you care?
I don't wanna do football.

387
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,690
You should've stayed on the team.

388
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,530
Finish things that you start.

389
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,967
- You don't walk away like a flake.
- Yo. Yo, Reese.

390
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,610
All right, well, I gotta go.

391
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,370
- Damn, man.
- What?

392
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,885
- Rick Houser.
- Evening, Ryan.

393
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,451
How you doing?

394
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,446
Dandy. What's this?

395
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,523
A camera. For the play.

396
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,011
- Play, huh?
- Yep.

397
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,970
- School night, all right?
- Yeah, we're just going to Ryan's.

398
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,124
Don't worry, Mr. Houser.
We'll have him back by bedtime.

399
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,805
- What's up?
- Hi, Reese.

400
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,121
Yeah.

401
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,486
Back seat, babe.

402
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,846
You got it.

403
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,208
Reese, your dad's got a point, man.

404
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,044
I'm not my dad, Ryan.

405
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,568
I know. That would be impossible.
But you didn't need to quit the team.

406
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,484
Well, I quit the team.

407
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,121
- And I'm not getting back on the team.
- Okay.

408
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,011
- Can we talk for...?
- It's like watching an infant on stage.

409
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,242
- You're a wonderful friend.
- Okay, excuse me.

410
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,485
Reese, can you explain what it is about Pfeifer,
because I don't see it. I don't get it.

411
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,802
- I'm pretty sure you don't.
- Here's him on sta...

412
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,564
- Pfeifer. Pf... Pf... Pfeifer.
- Heh.

413
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,250
C... Can I k... Kiss you?

414
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,368
You almost kissed
a real girl once, right?

415
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,761
- Come on. Yes, I've kissed...
- I think I remember.

416
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,010
I've kissed plenty of girls.
She's a nice person. She really is.

417
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,640
- "A nice person"?
- Just talk to her for five minutes.

418
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,921
All right, all right.

419
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,650
- Here we go.
- Dude, I'm so stoked.

420
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,211
I cannot believe
you talked me into this.

421
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,961
No one's gonna believe we did this.
Can I get a "For Pfeifer" on three?

422
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,201
One, two, three.

423
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,566
For Pfeifer!

424
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,563
- I'm not joining in on that.
- You're a...

425
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,202
You're sure it's fine
to park the car there?

426
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,927
Yeah, dude.
It's completely fine, so relax.

427
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,928
Can I get some stealth, please?

428
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,564
Jesus, heh.

429
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,683
Get up, babe. Babe, get up.

430
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,968
- This is so stupid.
- My boy, Reese Houser.

431
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,406
Just lower your voice a bit.

432
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,080
Trading in his baby balls
for some man testes.

433
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,170
Moment of truth.

434
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,166
Do the honors.

435
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,164
Do it, dude. Come on.

436
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,321
Okay.

437
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,680
It opened.

438
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,646
- Let's go.
- Come on.

439
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,040
It's open.

440
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,844
- Where's the light switch?
- Can we find some lights?

441
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,890
Shit.

442
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,211
Find a light switch.

443
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,521
Yeah.

444
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,089
The lights aren't working?
What, is the power out or something?

445
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,004
I cannot see anything at all.

446
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,818
Just ask and you shall receive, man.

447
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,680
Yes.

448
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,242
Whoa, whoa. Hey. Slow down.

449
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,568
There's something I wanna do first.

450
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,082
- We're here to take down the set.
- I know, dude. All right? Let's just...

451
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,287
Come on, please.

452
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,206
- This place is pretty different at night, huh?
- Ryan, can we just get this done?

453
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,006
Yes.

454
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,446
Oh, heh, score.

455
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,890
Stage boy, man,
I told you not to mess with me.

456
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,243
But you did, and now
I got some good stuff up my sleeve.

457
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,644
I have a couple options of what I would like
you to wear at tomorrow night's play.

458
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,257
Here's option number one.

459
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,044
You know? Little booby holes in there.

460
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,087
Number two,
which is my personal favorite.

461
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,288
I hope you enjoy it as well.

462
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,080
Ryan, stop messing around.

463
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,282
- Are you finished?
- Yeah.

464
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,841
Okay.

465
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,883
There's your sign, Cassidy.

466
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,411
Yeah, this place
is super creepy at night.

467
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,285
What do you think, man?

468
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,563
Let's just take this thing down
and get out of here.

469
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,726
Copy that.

470
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,364
Charlie.

471
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Charlie.
Come out and play.

472
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,843
What?
Cassidy, what the hell are you doing?

473
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,843
What I thought we came here to do.

474
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,569
That's my girl.

475
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,247
All right.

476
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,050
I wanna get something.

477
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,081
Yeah.

478
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,402
Felt good. Let me get another one.

479
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,161
...get this one?

480
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,230
Want me to get this one?

481
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,726
- What's up?
- Attaboy.

482
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,470
What is up?

483
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,967
- You gotta like it.
- Bring that light over here.

484
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,121
Will you keep it lit?

485
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,523
- Don't strip it, man.
- Who gives a shit? Are you gonna help me?

486
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,047
- One down, bro.
- Will you take something apart too?

487
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,361
I'm holding the light.

488
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,603
I'd like you to take something apart.
That way I'm not doing this...

489
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,165
"Help me take it apart."

490
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,607
The guy with no screwdriver.

491
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,046
Okay.

492
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,410
For you, sir.

493
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,729
Let's go, Shakespeare.

494
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,604
Come on, my man. Let's hear some lines.

495
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,802
- What?
- Now or never. Let's hear some lines.

496
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,487
What are you doing? Help me
take this apart. It was your idea.

497
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,085
August.

498
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,010
August?

499
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,771
I'm so frightened.

500
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,961
Just do it.

501
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,451
August, speak.

502
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,762
Please.

503
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,441
Don't worry, Mary. He wants me.
He's coming for me.

504
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,041
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

505
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,250
- I'm doing the line.
- Just say them better.

506
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,770
He wants me.

507
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,530
He is coming for me.

508
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,920
No one else.

509
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,924
Dost thou understand?

510
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Thou shall be safe...

511
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,405
Whoa. Get down here.

512
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,563
- Shit, cut the light.
- Lose the tools, dude. Lose the tools.

513
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,730
- Did you see anyone?
- No.

514
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,360
- I heard it over there.
- Is it that janitor, David?

515
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,289
- Who?
- Who else would be in here?

516
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,720
What do we do?

517
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,770
Reese, do you see anything?

518
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,766
Reese.

519
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,285
Okay, let's go out the back.

520
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,602
- Now?
- Yes, right now.

521
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,766
Let's go.

522
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

523
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,801
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit. Pfeifer?

524
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,086
Heh, you're kidding me.

525
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,004
Oh, my God.

526
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,685
Pfeifer.

527
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,321
- This is gonna be really good.
- Reese?

528
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,356
Oh, my gosh.

529
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,764
What are you guys doing here?

530
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,806
What are you doing here?

531
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,406
I saw Reese's car.
I saw your car in the parking lot.

532
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,642
I told you we should've parked
somewhere else.

533
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,643
- No kidding.
- Can I please talk to you?

534
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,922
Yeah. Let's just talk
over here for a second.

535
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,889
- Ryan, let's go.
- Alone, please.

536
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,081
- Ryan.
- Fine.

537
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,446
- Fine.
- Reese.

538
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,523
- What should I say?
- Make something up.

539
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,721
Ryan.

540
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,451
I'm just gonna leave the light
right here for you guys.

541
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,524
Reese, so, what's going on?

542
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,284
What are you guys doing here?

543
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,291
Well, we, uh... Heh.

544
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,889
Heh, what if you guys got caught?
What if it wasn't me that caught you?

545
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,926
- You wouldn't have been able to do the show.
- I know, I know. It's, heh...

546
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,604
It's stupid. I don't know what I was...
What we were thinking.

547
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,926
I'm sorry.

548
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,209
What are you guys doing here?

549
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,166
Uh...

550
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,126
You know, to, uh...

551
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,043
All right. We came to practice
a little bit. You know?

552
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,000
To go over some of the lines and stuff
because tomorrow's the show...

553
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,124
and I don't feel confident.

554
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,603
I don't wanna let you down...

555
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,360
Pfeifer.

556
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,526
I really don't.

557
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,601
Okay.

558
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,446
Promise?

559
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,961
Yeah.

560
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,605
Yeah, of course.

561
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,851
Okay? Okay.

562
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,287
Let's get out of here.
We shouldn't be here.

563
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,601
Let's go.

564
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,286
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What are we gonna do?

565
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,606
Oh, it's so dark.

566
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,121
Night vision app.

567
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,890
I know. I know, heh.

568
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,924
Hit a little snag there with drama queen
coming in and ruining the whole thing...

569
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,127
but Smooth McReese is gonna walk us
out of this so we can we finish this up.

570
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,250
Cassidy, what are you doing?

571
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,401
Fixing the set, babe.

572
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,086
I mean, we just took the set down.
What are you doing?

573
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,846
- But Pfeifer's here. She knows.
- She doesn't know. Look.

574
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,480
Reese is out there coming up
with some lame story.

575
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,681
Pfeifer's gonna leave.

576
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,481
This thing is practically taken apart.
Reese will just call us when he's done...

577
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,762
- and we can finish the job.
- Pfeifer knows.

578
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,888
I don't even have
any service on my phone.

579
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,965
That's weird, but what do you expect
when you're on it 24/7?

580
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,487
- Hey, Ryan, stop being dumb.
- I'm not being dumb.

581
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,690
If you wanna leave, go outside,
call Chelsea, have her come get you...

582
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,921
and you can leave.

583
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,570
But I'm staying.

584
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,847
God. This is so stupid.

585
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,208
It's not stupid, Ryan.
It's over. She knows.

586
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,681
You're stupid.
I told you this was gonna happen.

587
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,803
- I'm not stupid.
- But did I not say:

588
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,884
"If you decide to come, do not back out
because you get scared or..."

589
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,566
- I'm not backing out.
- You're clearly backing out.

590
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,001
Lookit. Where am I going right now?
Right to the door...

591
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,045
What the hell?

592
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,607
Funny, okay?

593
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,770
This thing isn't supposed to lock.

594
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,729
- Ryan.
- What?

595
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,451
- Just open the door.
- Oh, just open the...? Okay.

596
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,125
Let me give it another shot.

597
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,961
I can't unlock it.

598
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,730
- Pfeifer, give me that.
- Excuse me.

599
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,646
I can't unlock it.

600
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,564
- Pfeifer. Gimme that.
- Excuse me.

601
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,241
Is there some kind of trick
to this door, Pfeifer?

602
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,562
No. There's not a trick.
Why isn't it opening?

603
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,960
I don't know.

604
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,043
- What'd you do?
- He doesn't have service either.

605
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,247
He doesn't have it.

606
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,044
We shouldn't be in this situation.

607
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,362
- Find another door.
- What happened to this door?

608
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,806
I have no idea.

609
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,803
How does that not work?

610
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,004
We gotta go try something else.

611
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,685
That should open this door.

612
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,726
They're barred.

613
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,691
- What about the windows in the classroom?
- The classes are locked.

614
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,563
You guys are gonna get in trouble.
Not me.

615
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,802
- Let's go.
- Cassidy, we're trying to go.

616
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,161
Let's just get out, okay?

617
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,846
Yeah, I wanna get out of here.
Thank you. Do you, Ryan?

618
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,924
- Yes, I wanna go.
- You still wanna finish the job?

619
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,650
- You wanna finish it?
- Finish what?

620
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,444
- What do you think?
- Do not do that.

621
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,444
Do not what? I don't care.
We came to break the set, Pfeifer.

622
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,689
We came to break the set.
Reese, Ryan and I came to break the set.

623
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,887
- Are you serious?
- What?

624
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,044
- What is your problem?
- I don't have a problem. I wanna get out.

625
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,883
- Cassidy. Why would you say that?
- We need to get out.

626
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,520
Pfeifer. It was my idea, all right?

627
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,761
Pfeifer, please.

628
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,207
- Will you listen? Pfeifer.
- Pfeifer, it was my...

629
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,966
Will you stop talking for a second?
You've done enough.

630
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,289
- This play is an embarrassment.
- Shut up.

631
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,284
You're gonna embarrass everybody.
This needs to stop.

632
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,761
What?

633
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,283
I took that noose down.

634
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,649
Reese, I took that down.
You saw me take it down, man.

635
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,321
The stairs?

636
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,488
Can you guys please
stop messing with me?

637
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,483
We're not messing with you.

638
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,166
What did you guys do?

639
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,124
- Shut up.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

640
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,651
Stop, Pfeifer.

641
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,605
Practicing?

642
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,644
- You're such a liar.
- I'm sorr...

643
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,602
Reese, what the hell is this?

644
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,209
- Reese.
- I know, I know.

645
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,481
What do we do?

646
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,325
We'll go to the office.
There's a phone there.

647
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,281
Check this.

648
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,727
- Anything?
- This phone's dead. Where's the phone?

649
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,009
No, it's not working.

650
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,771
You're kidding me.
Anything that'll help us. Keys?

651
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,410
I don't know. Just look.

652
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,801
Have you found anything?

653
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,042
Go away. You're making everything worse.

654
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,761
That hurts, man. I'm sorry.

655
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,568
Hey, did you guys see this?

656
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,521
What?

657
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,280
What is that?

658
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,446
Does it open?

659
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,327
No. No, come on,
this is not a good idea.

660
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,051
Reese, we have run
into all locked doors.

661
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,371
Lights don't work.

662
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,405
Where are we?

663
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,364
Oh, my gosh.

664
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,806
Shh.

665
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,770
Reese, can you hear that?

666
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,166
What is that?

667
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,761
Listen.

668
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,165
Just open it.

669
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

670
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,364
Tragedy struck BHS last night...

671
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,161
when Charlie Grimille died
in what is now being called a freak accident.

672
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,968
A prop malfunctioned during the
school's presentation of The Gallows.

673
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,647
- Charlie...
- Shit.

674
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,801
Charlie...

675
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,770
BHS say his spirit will live on
in the theater.

676
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,807
It should've never ended like this.

677
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,481
It's just not fair.

678
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,369
That's that lady from the theater.

679
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,090
She was the girlfriend.

680
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,124
Grimille died playing a role
that he was never meant to play.

681
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,760
Charlie had originally been cast
as the hangman.

682
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,846
...department and created
a handmade costume.

683
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,243
Charlie was supposed to be the hangman.

684
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,846
- Charlie. What happened?
- Our leading man.

685
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,684
He called in sick. He called in sick.

686
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,121
Charlie Grimille was the understudy.

687
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,203
What about the hangman, though?

688
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,204
I guess there won't be one.

689
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,689
- Do it.
- Last one.

690
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,566
Here we go. Three, two, one.

691
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,287
What?

692
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,726
What? Do you see this?

693
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,809
Reese. Reese, what did you see?
Who was it?

694
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,361
- There's no tape in here.
- What is going on, dude?

695
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,568
- How do you get it back on?
- I don't know.

696
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,164
Help me. Come on.

697
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,524
- I need to look...
- Reese, hold on.

698
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,250
- Come with me.
- Reese, stop.

699
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,289
- Come on.
- Stop, Reese. Slow down.

700
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,045
I can't see.

701
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,887
- Reese, stop.
- Reese.

702
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,203
- Slow down.
- Slow down.

703
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,768
What? Reese, what's going on?

704
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,001
What the hell?

705
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,606
- Take the camera.
- Hold it, Cassidy.

706
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,125
Reese, what's wrong?

707
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,364
What are you doing?

708
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,965
Reese, what?

709
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,804
Talk to us.

710
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,604
What the hell is he doing?

711
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,441
Reese.

712
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,006
Just let me see.

713
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,284
Can I? What is it?

714
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,965
I don't understand.

715
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,731
Who is that?

716
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,886
Who is...?

717
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,283
Reese, is that your dad?

718
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,643
Ryan. Guys, where's Ryan?

719
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,926
Ryan?

720
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,407
Ryan.

721
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,403
Reese, give me the camera back, dude.

722
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,846
Reese.

723
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,811
Guys.

724
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,246
Reese?

725
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,041
Cassidy.

726
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,246
Guys.

727
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,291
Reese.

728
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,368
I don't like this.

729
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,565
Hey, man, you here?

730
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,170
Janitor still here...?

731
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,041
Hello?

732
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,726
David.

733
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,405
What the hell?

734
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,846
Hello?

735
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,360
Shit.

736
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,685
No, I'll do it.

737
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,564
What the...?

738
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,371
What is that?

739
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What...?
Shit.

740
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,365
Cassidy?

741
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,206
Cassidy.

742
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,441
Reese.

743
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,326
Okay.

744
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,726
What the hell?

745
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,443
Is this the wardrobe room?

746
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,284
Reese, where are you?

747
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,169
Damn it. Guys.

748
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the hell?

749
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,687
God.

750
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,091
- Ryan.
- Ryan?

751
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,730
- Guys! Reese!
- Hey! Ryan!

752
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,041
- Ryan?
- Ryan?

753
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,201
- Ryan!
- Guys!

754
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,811
- Ryan?
- Ryan?

755
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,964
- Ryan.
- Reese.

756
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,849
What the hell is your problem, dude?

757
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,128
You don't just take the light
and leave me there.

758
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,368
- Sorry. I needed the light.
- Tell him.

759
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,443
- What are you doing?
- It was my dad, dude.

760
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,489
Charlie was supposed to be the hangman.

761
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,688
My dad backed out.
That's why Charlie died.

762
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,285
Where the hell were you?

763
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,522
- Give me the camera.
- Get out, Ryan.

764
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,648
What, it was your dad that backed out?

765
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
The guy that called in sick was my dad.
That's why Charlie died.
Listen.
All I want to do is get out of...

766
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,981
Shh.

767
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,929
Shh. Shh. Shh.

768
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,648
Shh. Shh. Shh.

769
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Cassidy.
Just come over...

770
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,370
Cassidy! Cassidy!

771
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,966
Are you okay?

772
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,044
- Hold on a second, all right?
- I couldn't breathe.

773
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,887
- It lifted me off the freaking ground.
- Move out of my way, Pfeifer. Move.

774
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,202
I wanna see it.
I need to get a good look at it.

775
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,203
- You're not seeing it, Ryan.
- I need to.

776
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,089
- Just breathe.
- Ryan, don't touch her.

777
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,767
- Get off of me! She's my girlfriend!
- Ryan, get me out of here! I am done!

778
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,241
- Stop. Let me just see it.
- I am done!

779
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,846
Ryan, you're the reason
we're freaking in here!

780
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,809
- Get the hell out!
- Fine, Cassidy!

781
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,246
And get me out!

782
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,324
- Figure it out yourself!
- You don't give a shit about me!

783
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,721
Let me see.

784
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,406
Reese.

785
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,044
Reese, dude, talk to me.
We need to figure this out.

786
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,725
What is happening?

787
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,886
- I don't know, man.
- What do you mean you don't know?

788
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,804
I mean, what was that with Cassidy?

789
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,645
The TV? What was your dad doing there?
What is that about?

790
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,450
- Stop it.
- What do you mean?

791
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,648
Cassidy's hurt
and you haven't said anything?

792
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,801
Are you serious?

793
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,406
Don't put this on me.
You're the reason we came here.

794
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,609
Yeah, but maybe you're the reason
all this shit's happening to us!

795
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,410
- Don't even do that, okay?
- Why not?

796
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,131
- You brought me here!
- I brought you here to help you!

797
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,725
You were not trying to help me.

798
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,168
- You came here to help yourself.
- That is not true! It was to help you!

799
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,641
- You're the reason this is going bad.
- We're stuck!

800
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,802
Why don't you tell us everything, Reese?

801
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,651
Like how Charlie's dead because
your dad didn't show up.

802
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,525
- I didn't know. He didn't tell me.
- Stop fighting.

803
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,404
- Come on.
- Guys, that's enough.

804
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,166
Guys.

805
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,011
Look at that.

806
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,287
What?

807
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,446
Guys...

808
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,051
look at the vent.

809
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,244
Air conditioning duct.

810
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,002
- It could go outside.
- It goes somewhere.

811
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,207
Ryan? Come on.

812
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,887
What, Reese? One of us has to do
something. I'm not just gonna sit around.

813
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,963
God, Ryan. Please.

814
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,762
- Hold this, Reese.
- What? All right.

815
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,490
- Reese, hold it.
- I got it.

816
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,684
Babe, relax. What are you doing?

817
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,446
What am I doing?
I'm getting us out of here.

818
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,001
- Hey, Charlie!
- Don't say that name, Ryan.

819
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,605
- Please, man.
- Stop.

820
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,486
- Don't say his name.
- Don't say his name?

821
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,483
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie!

822
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,483
Seriously, this is not funny, okay?

823
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,328
- What was that?
- So sick of this!

824
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,130
- Stop! Stop!
- Ryan!

825
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,442
Come on, Charlie. Show yourself.

826
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,969
Show me something, Charlie.

827
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,525
Come on!

828
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,725
- Ryan, please.
- Stop it!

829
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,969
- Stop saying the name.
- Do you not hear what's going on?

830
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,361
Ryan, get down right now!

831
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,921
Goddamn it, Ryan! Stop this!
You're being stupid!

832
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,764
You're gonna get yourself killed!

833
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,446
- Ryan, please, man!
- Stop it.

834
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,641
Okay.

835
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Now, come down. Will you just
come down? Please, stop it.
Reese, I got this.

836
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,041
No!

837
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,201
No!

838
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,241
Cassidy!

839
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,045
Ryan, you're okay. You're okay.

840
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,890
Talk to him.

841
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,483
I'm gonna go get something for you.

842
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,483
I'm gonna go, okay? I'll be right back.

843
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,801
Pfeifer? Pfeifer.

844
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,365
No, don't! No, no, no!

845
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,807
Oh, my God, his leg.

846
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,208
- It's okay.
- It's broken. It's broken.

847
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,481
Reese!

848
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,569
Oh, my God.

849
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,683
- Ryan!
- What happened?

850
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,241
Cassidy.

851
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,681
- Take this.
- Okay, I got it. I got it.

852
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,571
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

853
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,768
Why did you leave? I told you to stay.

854
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,684
Ryan! Ryan!

855
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,001
Ryan!

856
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

857
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,451
Ryan!

858
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,011
Ryan?

859
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,167
Ryan? Ryan, I'm so sorry.

860
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,805
It's okay. He's okay.

861
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,521
Wait here.

862
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,051

Ryan.

865
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,241
Ryan.

866
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,004
It's okay. He's okay.
He's fine. He's all right.

867
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,841
Ryan.

868
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,161
Ryan, are you there?

869
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,640
Ryan.

873
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,366
Oh, my God.

What are we gonna do, Ryan?

880
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,765
Wait, Cassidy.

881
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,686
I don't know what you want me
to do. I don't know what you want me to do.

882
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,366
What do you want?
I don't know what to do.

883
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,608
Cassidy, do something!

884
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,086
Please.

885
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,447
- I can't do anything.
- Please.

886
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,247
- Please, Cassidy!
- I'm so sorry.

887
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,121
Do something.

888
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,805
- I'm gonna get them.
- No, no, no!

889
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,362
Don't leave! Don't leave me here,
Cassidy! Please, come back!

890
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,051
Holy shit.

891

Ryan.

910
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,207
Ryan. Why?

911
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,330
Reese, why?

912
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,963

915
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,169
Oh, my God. Reese.

916
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,526
Her neck. It's worse.

917
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,361
Okay, stay there.

918
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,885
Reese, hurry. Hurry.

919
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,281
God. What the hell? Come on.

920
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,161
That's locked.

921
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,930
I can get up there.

922
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,846
Oh, no.

923
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,167
Please, no, no, no. Please.

924
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,403
I need a light. I need a light.

925

Okay.

930
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,643
- Reese, what's going on?
- I don't know. The light on the camera died.

931
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,327
You think it has to do with the show?
You guys tried to stop it.

932
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,527
Pfeifer, please.

933
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,729
I think I found a way out.
I need you to stay with Cassidy, okay?

934
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,406
Where the hell...?

935
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,645
Dude, no.

936
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,766
No.

937
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,161
God.

938
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,291
Okay.

939
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,809
We're getting out of here.

940
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,606
It can't be.

941
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,050
It can't be. No.

942
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,169
No, where is it? It was right here.

943
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,444
It was just right here.

944
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,008
What the hell is going on?

945
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,090
Where are you?

946
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,571
Don't hang up.

947
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,242
Don't hang up! Come on.

Oh, come on. Please, please, please.

00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,609
No. No. What?

951
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,006
Come on!

952
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,371
Come on! Come on, don't hang up, Dad.
Don't hang up.

953
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,681
Where's that coming from?

954
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:59,208
It's my phone. It's in the locker.
It's in the locker. My dad's calling.

955
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,761
We gotta get it open.

956
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,606
Keep ringing. Don't hang up.
Get out of the way. Get out of the way.

957
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,285
- Hello? Dad? Dad.
- Who is it?

958
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,011
Dad. Dad, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm at the school.

959
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,085
He wants me. He's coming for me.

960
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,086
No!

961
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,961
Why?

962
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,561
Why?

963
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,327
Why did I do this stupid play?

964
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,241
I'm sorry I asked you to do this.

965
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,762
Oh, Pfeifer. Oh, God.

966
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,809
I'm sorry. It's not...

967
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,725
Do you have your cell phone on you?
Check your cell phone.

968
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,245
See if you have service, okay?

969
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,281
God.

Cassidy!

973
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,001
Where is she?

974
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,049
Come on, Pfeifer, help me, please.

975
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,486
Cassidy, come on.

976
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,928
The other battery's in.
I think we should...

977
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,241
Oh, my God.

978
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,401
Cassidy.

979
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,891
Wait, the fire alarm.

980
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,044
- Come on, we gotta pull the fire alarm.
- What if he finds us?

981
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,249
- Fire alarm. There's one backstage.
- Stay close behind me.

982
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,684
The fire alarm's right up here.

983
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,604
What if it doesn't work?

984
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,125
It's gonna work.

985
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,526
Okay, pull it.

986
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,566
Pfeif, pull it.

987
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,411
He's gonna find us.

988
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,164
We have to try.

989
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,081
Reese.

990
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,008
Okay. Oh, my God. It worked.

991
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,322
- We're getting out of here.
- It worked.

992
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,044

- Oh, Reese.
- We're okay, we're okay.

994
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,282
We're getting out of here.
We're gonna be okay.

995
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,562
We're gonna make it.
We're all gonna make it.

996
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,087
We're gonna be fine.
We're gonna get out of here.

997
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,208
The firemen will be here
any second, okay?

998
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,244
Should we wait on stage?

999
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,564
No. No. No, we're gonna stay right
here, okay? They're gonna find us right here.

1000
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,166
Reese. What's that?

1001
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,850
Do you not see it?

1002
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,290
I don't see anything.

1003
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,083
I saw a shadow. I know I saw a shadow.

1004
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,851
Pfeifer. Where? I don't see it.

1005
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000

Reese, I'm scared.
There's nothing there, okay?
There's nothing there. You're okay.

- No! He's coming!
- Keep going!

1015
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,406
- Take it, take it, here. Take it.
- Reese...

1016
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,684
- Shine the light. I need the light.
- I know!

1017
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,251
Just close it!

1018
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,688
- Come on.
- Give me the camera.

1019
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,120
- Open!

1020
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,482
- Shit.
- Go, go, go!

1021
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,481
Reese.

1022
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,244
I don't wanna go any farther.

1023
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,370
- Pfeifer, we can't stay here.
- I'm not going.

1024
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,608
We can't stay here.
Pfeifer, we gotta move.

1025
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,330
I don't know what's back there.

1026
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,431
Pfeifer, listen to me.
You have got to move. Please.

1027
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,046
Reese.

1028
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,166
It stopped.

1029
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,928
- I think the police may be here.
- Okay, good.

1030
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,526
- Someone turned the alarm off.
- Let's just stay here.

1031
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:11,047
- That means they're here.
- I'm not going down there.

1032
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,641
The police are here.
We have to get downstairs.

1033
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,121
We're gonna be okay.

1034
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,601
- We just gotta get down, okay?
- I don't want to go.

1035
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:22,204
- I'm right here. I'm right here.

They turned the alarm off.
The police are down there.

1037
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,281

- I hate this.

1038
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,171
I'm right here. I'm right here.
I'm right here.

1039
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,651
I'm right behind.

1040
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,244
Take my hand. I'll get in front of you.
I'll go in front.

1041
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,521
Okay?

1042
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,527
Stay right here with me. It's okay.

1043
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,846
It's all right.

1044
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,841
Okay.

1045
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,321
Pfeifer, we gotta duck down
under the vents, okay?

1046
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,606
Stay with me.

1047
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,681
What...?

1048
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,561
What the hell? What...?

1049
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,882
Oh, no.

1050
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,485
It's gonna be okay.

1051
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,491
Watch your head.

1052
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,771
Do you hear that?

1053
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,406
Hear what?

1054
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,046
What is that?

1055
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Okay, it's no...

1056
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,001
- Oh, my...!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Aah!

1057
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,686
Oh, my God.

1058
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,209
Pfeifer, don't look. Don't look.

1059
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,286
I'm sorry.

1060
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,165
I'm so sorry.

1061
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,288
I'm so sorry, guys.

1062
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,444
This is all my fault.

1063
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,201
Hey.

1064
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,681
It's okay.

1065
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,201
It's okay.

1066
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,201
No.

1067
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,762
Hey. Hey, look at me.

1068
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,160
Look at me.

1069
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,241
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

1070
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,085
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you. Okay?

1071
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,121
Let's go.

1072
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,649
- I got it.
- You got it?

1073
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,087
Here, give it to me. All right.

1074
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,522
Where is everybody? Where's the police?

1075
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,845
Damn it, it's locked.

1076
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,690
Why is it locked?

1077
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,490
Where is everyone?

1078
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,681
It's open.

1079
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,881
Reese.

1080
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,727
Where is everyone? Why is no one here?

1081
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,803
I don't see anybody.

1082
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,250
There should be police here.

1083
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,161
Okay.

1084
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,165
We have to cross the stage.

1085
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,641
Yeah, okay. Let's go quickly. Let's go.

1086
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,371
We're gonna make it, Pfeif. Let's go.
We got it.

Okay. Yes.

1088
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,125
Yes, yes, yes.

1089
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,650
We made it.

1090
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:32,801
Oh, we're okay.

1091
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,001
Look, Pfeifer...

1092
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,680
Pfeifer?

1093
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,325
Help me. I can't...

1094
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,606
Pfeifer.

1095
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,883
- Help!
- Shit.

1096
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,165
Where are they?

1097
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,241
Pfeifer?

1098
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,246
Pfeifer!

1099
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,441
Help.

1100
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,326
Pfeifer!

1101
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Okay. What's wrong? What's wrong?
You gotta tell me what's wrong.
- I can't breathe.
- What's wrong? Come on.

1102
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,362
What shall we do?

1103
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,000
Don't worry.

1104
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,445
He wants me.

1105
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,490
He's coming for me. No one else.

1106
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,324
Dost thou understand?

1107
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,649
Thou shalt be safe here.

1108
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,644
Art thou afraid?

1109
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,250
I am no more.

1110
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:51,966
Give me one last kiss.

1111
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:13,920
It's okay.

1112
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,125
He'll let you go.

1113
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:17,841
Okay.

1114
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,611
He'll let you go.

1115
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,811
It's okay.

1116
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,527
Pfeif, you need to go, okay?
You're gonna be fine.

1117
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,682
August, don't leave me.

1118
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,806
- Hey, you don't have to do this.
- August, don't go, okay?

1119
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,606
- You don't have to do that.
- August, for I am frightened.

1120
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,081
Why are you saying that?
Stop calling me that. Go.

1121
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,287
- August.
- Pfeifer, stop.

1122
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,441
Do not leave me.

1123
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,206
- Stop calling me that. Listen to me.
- August, please.

1124
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,442
Pfeifer, goddamn you.
Why don't you leave?

1125
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,290
- Why aren't you leaving?
- August, no.

1126
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,408
Goddamn it, Pfeifer, no! No, no, no!

1127
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,570
- Pfeifer, please stop!
- August, please don't leave me!

It's the police.

1134
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,687
If anybody's here, identify yourself.

1135
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,361
Kitchen clear. No sign of Pfeifer.

1136
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,330
Pfeifer. Mrs. Ross. It's the police.

1137
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,691
What the hell?

Oh, God.

1143

Charlie Grimille?

1144
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,122
You shouldn't say that name.

1145
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Lang.

I need you back here.
Hold on!
