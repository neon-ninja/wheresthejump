but the moment you die,

right then, your brain just floods your
system with this massive blast of DMT,

240

on the planet.

as opposed to, you know,
St. Peter and the pearly white gates?

251
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,523

- Because one is empirical and one is,

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,563
you know, it's a cute story, but it's...

253
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,640
No, it's not. I mean, whatever you
wanna call it, the soul, consciousness,

254
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,288
it's just neural impulses firing in
your brain, right? That makes it energy.

255
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,005
Energy can't be created or destroyed,

256
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,606
it can just be transformed
from one thing to another.

257

that's science.

EVA: So what's your theory?

259
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,407
I think, maybe when we die, the DMT
is there to help our souls move on,

260
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,483
to get them wherever
they're supposed to be.

261
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,601
- You know, open the door for them.

"Here. Here's life, here's death.

The dean needs to talk to you.

331
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,282
WOMAN: Honestly, did you for one second
consider the implications of this?

332
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,642
Eighty-three percent of our student body
identify as religious.

333
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,691
You throw in the alumni donors,
that number's more like 90 percent.

334
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,605
Don't play the religious card.
This has nothing to do with religion.

335
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,923
You were the one who decided
to do an unsanctioned experiment,

336
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,889
in direct violation of the Review Board

337
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,963
and the grant agreement
which you signed.

338
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,561
Which says, you were
going to "study new methods

339
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,200
of arresting neural decay
in coma patients."

340
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,567
Yes, exactly! That is how it started.

341
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,371
But how do you think that penicillin
was discovered? Or Teflon?

342
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,569
Or even Coca-Cola, for that matter?
Accidents that happen in the lab.

343
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,001
Accidents that lead
to new lines of inquiry.

344
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,563
You are a doctor, you understand
how science works. It's by adapting.

345
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,930
You're not adapting. You are playing God
with a bunch of dead animals.

346
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,844
You had to know this was coming.

347
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,362
How do you know all this?

348
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,042
No way you could've known
about those animal trials.

that's posted to our server,

351
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,725
Somebody fed this to you, specifically
to get this project shut down.

352
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,285
Was it one of your big pharma friends?

353
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,331
Did somebody donate a medical wing
or a new student union?

354
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,527
Who was it?

355
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,651

- Hey, that's personal property, man!

364
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,880
I don't understand.
We're operating under a grant

365
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,361
- from Werner-Goss Biotechnical.
- And as of two hours ago,

366
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,603
Crylonis Industries became the
principal shareholder in Werner-Goss.

I'm sure it must be difficult for you,

to be learned here:

374
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,441
There's always a consequence
for breaking the rules.

it's quite the coincidence.

00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,444
You show up out of nowhere,
videotape everything, and then poof,

379
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,722
they take it all,
including our backup data.

380
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,850
Hang on. We made her keep all the
footage in the lab. It's not her fault.

381
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,729
We lost everything.

382
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,043
Four years of our lives,
our reputations, everything.

383
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,726
If it's not her, then please tell me,
what the hell happened?

384
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,201
If they wanted the serum,
why didn't they just hire us?

385
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,926
I mean, let's imagine for a second
that you're Crylonis, OK?

386
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,844
And you find out
about the Lazarus serum.

387
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,889
You realize this thing is a gold mine,

388
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,686
and you also realize
that Werner-Goss sponsored it.

389
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,207
So you buy Werner-Goss,
that's the first thing right there.

390
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,523
Then you realize all is takes is
one anonymous call to the Review Board,

391
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,331
and all of a sudden
you own everything in that lab.

392
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,527
You have the legal rights.

393
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,921
Suddenly, you're not
splitting the profits anymore.

It's the only way.

- You're joking, right?
- What, we're gonna walk away now?

400
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,921
We have no proof. No one's ever
gonna believe that it was us.

401
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,208
We're never gonna have
another chance at this, OK?

402
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,647
Look, they're not gonna start
cleaning the lab till tomorrow, right?

403
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,609
That gives us at least,
what, like 12 hours?

404
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,047
We break in there,
we duplicate the experiment.

405

You film it,
and we take back what's ours.

406
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,125
Duplicate it how?
I mean, they took all the serum.

407
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,330
We figured, just in case.

This is absolutely doable.

411

They took our key cards.

I couldn't wake up.

I was stuck.
It was endless. I tried.

And every day, I was there.

- Oh, no, no. You don't understand.

your body creates... like a compound,

- and it helps your soul move on or...
- DMT.
