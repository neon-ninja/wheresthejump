1
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:18,270
Is it on?
- Whenever you want.

2
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,775
We're right in the middle of
the industrial site of Chamfors.

3
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,977
This is where they found the child.

4
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:28,941
Building 1.

5
00:01:29,992 --> 00:01:33,242
We've got permission
to make this movie.

6
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:36,330
As a medical archive

7
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:39,035
for the pediatric ward
of the hospital.

8
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:44,417
There you go.

9
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:47,502
She lived there.

10
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:53,001
She wasn't raped,
that's for sure.

11
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,550
It looks more
like common abuse.

12
00:01:56,726 --> 00:02:01,221
Malnutrition, dehydration,
mild hypothermia.

13
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,806
The hole allows the person to
do one's needs without standing up.

14
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:09,104
The infection of the wrists proves
she was chained.

15
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:12,396
How did she get out of here?

16
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:14,566
Lucie doesn't tell a thing
about what she went through.

17
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:09,823
What's that? Orange juice?
- Yes.

18
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:11,994
Is it for her?
- Yes.

19
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:15,455
You're a real mom.
- She's got no one else.

20
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:07,011
Don't worry, Anna,
those gentlemen

21
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:10,507
are really nice.
- Okay.

22
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,010
Do you know why we
show you this movie?

23
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,348
Yes.

24
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:19,639
Why do we need you?
- Because...

25
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:23,020
...you want to get the people

26
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:26,195
who hurt Lucie.
- Yes, Anna.

27
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:30,324
Lucie wants that too.
She says they have to get caught.

28
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,033
What else did she say?
You talk to her for hours...

29
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:34,484
She's afraid.

30
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:37,617
Does she tell you things?
- She's afraid.

31
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,825
What does she remember?

32
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:42,243
She doesn't know who it is.

33
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,753
Sometimes she thinks she remembers
something, sometimes she doesn't.

34
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:51,294
What do you think?
Do you think she will remember?

35
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,049
It was dark and she didn't see it well.
She doesn't remember.

36
00:04:59,143 --> 00:05:00,306
Enter.

37
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:06,189
Lucie Jurin didn't come.

38
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:19,990
Lucie?

39
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,680
Anna...

40
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,728
Don't tell, OK?

41
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:51,227
I won't.
- It's not me.

42
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:53,022
It's not me.

43
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:54,820
It's not me.

44
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:58,062
Calm down.

45
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,290
Do you want to come?

46
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:56,539
Anna?

47
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

48
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

49
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

50
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,198
15 YEARS LATER

51
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,930
Give it to me!

52
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:53,564
Give it to me!

53
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:58,028
Stop, both of you.

54
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,653
Damned!

55
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:04,491
You'll see how poorly she writes.

56
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:08,952
Stop, I said.
- You're the worst!

57
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:12,616
Don't touch me.
By the way, it's none of your business.

58
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:15,293
What do you know?
You don't know what love is.

59
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:17,256
You don't have a boyfriend.

60
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,260
And? Are we gonna eat breakfast or not?
- Yeah, yeah.

61
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:22,841
You're getting on my nerves.

62
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,557
I hate you.

63
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:28,668
CHAMPION 100 METRES BUTTERFLY

64
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:47,151
And you talk about it like that?

65
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:49,824
How should I talk about it?
- Smartass...

66
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:53,365
A Sunday morning.
Did you talk about it with your mother?

67
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,867
Yes.
- And what did you say?

68
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:57,959
That she had problems with the pressure.

69
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:02,123
If she works, she ain't happy.
- Are you happy?

70
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:06,380
I'm having fun.
- I'm having fun.

71
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,469
Done.
- Good.

72
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:11,129
Here.

73
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:13,634
A gift.

74
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:17,183
Damned, Gabrielle.
- Gross!

75
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:19,266
In the main pipe?

76
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:21,771
There's you shower
that doesn't run like it should.

77
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:24,310
Gross.
- Come on, let's eat.

78
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:30,063
Yeah, I'm being gross,
but now we can use the garden again.

79
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:33,527
Did Antoine talk
about his big projects?

80
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,994
I asked what you thought of them.

81
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:40,535
No, you wondered if she was pissed off.
- Don't start. It's none of your business.

82
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:44,168
It's my brother.
- Your brother's a dreamer.

83
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,418
Hey, Antoine?

84
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:50,626
You can't leave a school
that costs that much after 3 months.

85
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:52,837
Definitely not if you pay in advance.
- There you go.

86
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:56,217
- Stop it, you!
- She's always bragging
since the newspaper article.

87
00:10:56,808 --> 00:10:59,382
Are you gonna do it every time?
- What?

88
00:10:59,686 --> 00:11:02,770
Even for your graduation
we had to pay a private school.

89
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:05,222
With a lot of effort.
- I did graduate.

90
00:11:05,525 --> 00:11:09,569
Thank God. Did you know
how much it cost?

91
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:13,070
Your money, for the trimesters.
To hear you didn't care at all.

92
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,525
Really, Antoine, isn't it hard
to be so irritating?

93
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:19,282
That school... it's not the same.

94
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:22,280
I wanted to do something I liked.

95
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:25,291
We didn't force you.
- No, but...

96
00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:29,079
law school, it's not my thing.
- You can get anywhere with it.

97
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,373
That's not the point.
He wants to live with his girlfriend.

98
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:35,461
Law school, it's not my thing.
- Whatever, Antoine.

99
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:39,502
There's nothing you like.
Once you even wanted to become a baker.

100
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:43,595
That's unheard of.

101
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:47,599
Who's the butthole?

102
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:51,477
- Be friendly, Marie Belfond.
- It's Sunday.

103
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
So? Why do you need to rest on Sunday?
Your week in the factory?

104
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:04,367
Stay there. Don't move!

105
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:23,548
Don't move!

106
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,551
Sit down!

107
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,228
How old are you?

108
00:12:38,903 --> 00:12:40,313
18.

109
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:45,405
Do you know what your parents did?

110
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

111
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:23,865
Why did you do that to me?

112
00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:31,663
Why did you do that to me?

113
00:14:38,721 --> 00:14:40,381
Why?

114
00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:24,464
It's them.
- Lucie?

115
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,762
It's them, Anna.
- Did you see them?

116
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:29,216
They've changed, but it's definitely them.
- Are you sure?

117
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:31,681
I'm telling you.
- Lucie, it's been 15 years.

118
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:33,805
And you find them in a paper?
- I'm telling you.

119
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:36,147
We'll call the police.
- Don't bother.

120
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:37,983
What?
- I did what I needed to do.

121
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:40,233
What did you do?
- What I needed to do!

122
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:42,940
You had to observe them. You weren't sure.
- I'm sure.

123
00:15:43,113 --> 00:15:46,981
I knew I had to come along
- Why don't you believe me?

124
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:51,483
Where are you calling from?

125
00:15:52,288 --> 00:15:54,365
From the house.
- From theirs?

126
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:57,122
Yes.
- Give me the address.

127
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:01,541
Lucie, give me the address!

128
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

129
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:12,616
I did it...

130
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:30,049
Look...

131
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,014
I did it...

132
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

133
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

134
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,082
It's me, Lucie. It's me.
Calm down. It's me.

135
00:21:57,418 --> 00:21:58,793
She's there.

136
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,424
She's in the house.
- I know.

137
00:22:09,805 --> 00:22:12,011
She hurt me more than before.

138
00:22:29,697 --> 00:22:30,978
Stay here.

139
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,479
Where are you going?

140
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:34,902
I have to go take a look.
- She's there.

141
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,952
I have to go take a look.
- She's in the house.

142
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:41,034
Look at me, I have to go take a look.
Wait for me.

143
00:23:56,028 --> 00:23:59,064
She hurt me more than before.
- I'm coming, Lucie.

144
00:24:02,283 --> 00:24:04,157
What am I going to do?

145
00:24:05,536 --> 00:24:07,078
I'm coming.

146
00:24:49,744 --> 00:24:52,068
I don't have any more shells.
- You won't be needing them.

147
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:54,530
- Why don't we leave?
- Come.

148
00:24:54,832 --> 00:24:56,290
She'll come back.

149
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,996
Come.

150
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:02,455
You called me from here
Everyone will know it's us.

151
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:05,707
I don't care.
- Yes.

152
00:25:06,844 --> 00:25:10,047
I don't care.
- Sitting in a cell. You DO care.

153
00:25:16,936 --> 00:25:19,225
What are we going to do?
- Don't move.

154
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:23,433
It hurts.
- Sorry.

155
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,230
What are we gonna do, Anna?

156
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,769
Are you OK?

157
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,069
Are you repulsed? By what I did?

158
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,832
Do you smell this?

159
00:26:28,335 --> 00:26:29,829
That foul stench?

160
00:26:30,003 --> 00:26:33,704
I smelled that every time
she bent over me. Everyday.

161
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:35,376
Do you understand?

162
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,958
When she hit me, I smelled that.

163
00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:49,142
Look.

164
00:26:51,982 --> 00:26:53,097
It's them.

165
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,341
What are you doing?

166
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,437
Do you think I'm gonna get out of this?

167
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,275
Yes. Yes.

168
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

169
00:30:04,492 --> 00:30:06,984
Please, don't make a sound.

170
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:15,711
Anna, what are you doing?

171
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:19,828
Are you okay?
- Yes.

172
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:21,925
I called..
- I was there.

173
00:30:22,093 --> 00:30:24,251
I thought she came back.
- No.

174
00:30:24,553 --> 00:30:26,711
Are you ready? We're leaving.

175
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:29,012
We're gonna clean the house
- Are we leaving?

176
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:30,802
Get dressed.

177
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:09,214
Lucie!

178
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Open up, Anna.
- It's closed, Lucie.

179
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:42,990
Open up!

180
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:25,118
Quick!

181
00:32:35,924 --> 00:32:37,633
What do you want?

182
00:32:38,595 --> 00:32:40,218
Leave me alone.

183
00:32:40,512 --> 00:32:41,757
I killed them!

184
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:45,633
Even the children!

185
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:48,181
I even killed the children!

186
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,276
Calm down! Calm down!

187
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

188
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:02,928
Get away from there, whore!

189
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,930
I'm gonna kill you!

190
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,786
Sorry.

191
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:36,788
It's not my fault.

192
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,099
Where are you?

193
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:49,321
Anna, I know you're in there.
Open up!

194
00:36:52,912 --> 00:36:54,288
I'm coming.

195
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,091
What's your name?

196
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,878
Gabrielle...

197
00:37:15,725 --> 00:37:17,385
I'm coming, Lucie!

198
00:37:17,894 --> 00:37:19,553
You have to help me, Gairielle.

199
00:37:19,853 --> 00:37:22,225
Why did she do that?

200
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:41,412
I think she heard us.

201
00:37:53,176 --> 00:37:54,884
It has to go fast.

202
00:38:08,148 --> 00:38:10,307
An ambulance.
- I can't.

203
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
For my kids...
Come on!
Right up to the forest.
After that you're on your own, OK?

204
00:38:19,325 --> 00:38:21,898
No! Stop!

205
00:38:25,455 --> 00:38:26,700
Stop! Lucie!

206
00:39:09,204 --> 00:39:10,864
Why did you defend her?

207
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:15,414
She didn't do anything, Lucie.
- She hurt me!

208
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,123
To me!

209
00:39:22,676 --> 00:39:24,502
Do you want her to live?

210
00:39:50,826 --> 00:39:52,404
You never believed me!

211
00:39:53,454 --> 00:39:54,569
Stop!

212
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:59,408
You think I'm crazy.
Like the others. Like the doctors.

213
00:40:03,505 --> 00:40:05,213
What did they do for me?

214
00:40:05,382 --> 00:40:07,954
Apart from saying I'm crazy?
And you're like them?

215
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,973
It's over, Anna!

216
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:36,656
They're dead.
They won't hurt you again.

217
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,719
Stop!

218
00:43:22,272 --> 00:43:23,895
No!

219
00:45:36,771 --> 00:45:38,679
Why are you calling me? Huh?

220
00:45:38,897 --> 00:45:42,729
I don't hear a thing from you
for two years, and then you call me.

221
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:45,227
Yes.
- I'm angry at you, Anna.

222
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:47,562
I'm not gonna lie.
- Mom.

223
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,945
What do you want?
Make me feel guilty?

224
00:45:50,116 --> 00:45:51,314
No.

225
00:45:51,701 --> 00:45:55,117
Don't you think I feel like that?
Don't you think I'm not thinking about

226
00:45:55,288 --> 00:45:57,909
all the things that
I've been missing out on?

227
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:01,995
No, mom, that's not it.
- What is it then?

228
00:46:02,879 --> 00:46:05,500
I wanted to speak to you, that's all.
I wasn't thinking.

229
00:46:05,715 --> 00:46:08,835
Like that. On a day
you decide you're missing your mother.

230
00:46:09,426 --> 00:46:13,424
Are you doing fine, you've got no problems?
- No.

231
00:46:13,597 --> 00:46:14,972
Are you sure? Where are you?

232
00:46:15,557 --> 00:46:16,838
Far away.

233
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,684
Where do you sleep?
How do you make a living?

234
00:46:21,854 --> 00:46:25,768
- It's OK, mom.
- Are you still with her?
Is she influencing you?

235
00:46:25,941 --> 00:46:26,855
No.

236
00:46:27,026 --> 00:46:29,564
My God! You're still with her.

237
00:46:29,737 --> 00:46:31,610
It's still the same.
- Mom...

238
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,359
Anna, she's worthless, she's a slut.

239
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,075
She's worth less than nothing.
Don't stay with her.

240
00:46:41,497 --> 00:46:42,492
Anna?

241
00:46:43,248 --> 00:46:44,280
Don't you have anything to say?

242
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

243
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

244
00:52:18,809 --> 00:52:19,972
Don't move.

245
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:16,730
I can't take care of you.

246
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,142
Don't be afraid.

247
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,179
Calm down.

248
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,974
Calm down.

249
00:55:28,985 --> 00:55:30,444
Rest.

250
00:55:57,928 --> 00:55:58,959
Sorry.

251
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,845
Sorry.

252
00:57:06,783 --> 00:57:07,981
Stop!

253
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

254
00:58:11,927 --> 00:58:13,670
Who's the girl on the couch?

255
00:58:14,346 --> 00:58:15,674
Who is it?

256
00:58:16,723 --> 00:58:18,181
Lucie...

257
00:58:18,557 --> 00:58:21,393
- Lucie who?
- Lucie Jurin.

258
00:58:21,686 --> 00:58:22,848
And you?

259
00:58:24,689 --> 00:58:26,064
And?

260
00:58:26,274 --> 00:58:27,601
Anna Assaoui.

261
00:58:28,191 --> 00:58:31,358
We're trying to reach the Belfonds
for hours. The phone's been busy.

262
00:58:31,528 --> 00:58:34,198
- The phone's off the hook.
- That should not be happening.

263
00:58:35,032 --> 00:58:37,239
Can you tell me what's happening here?

264
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,947
What are you doing here?

265
01:01:14,721 --> 01:01:18,090
Lucie Jurin escaped 15 years ago,
correct?

266
01:01:20,101 --> 01:01:21,180
Correct?

267
01:01:22,687 --> 01:01:23,931
Yes.

268
01:01:24,146 --> 01:01:27,978
It was a time
in which we were less organized.

269
01:01:28,275 --> 01:01:31,691
Gabrielle shouldn't have let
it happen. The girl found her.

270
01:01:32,154 --> 01:01:35,985
After 15 years.
That's shows a lot of persistance.

271
01:01:36,157 --> 01:01:39,323
But in the end,
Lucie is a victim.

272
01:01:40,077 --> 01:01:41,951
Like all the others.

273
01:01:43,164 --> 01:01:47,077
It's easy to create
a victim. Very easy.

274
01:01:48,376 --> 01:01:52,706
Lock someone up in a dark place,
they start to suffer.

275
01:01:53,298 --> 01:01:55,456
Feed that suffering.

276
01:01:55,759 --> 01:01:58,760
Methodically, systematic.

277
01:01:59,054 --> 01:02:01,758
And cold. And keep it going.

278
01:02:02,682 --> 01:02:06,679
The subject goes through
different stages.

279
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:09,765
After a while the trauma,

280
01:02:10,648 --> 01:02:13,352
that little crack
that happens so easily,

281
01:02:13,651 --> 01:02:17,101
makes it see things that aren't there.

282
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:20,562
What did poor Lucie see?

283
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,242
Didn't she see things?

284
01:02:25,328 --> 01:02:27,070
Not even monsters?

285
01:02:28,288 --> 01:02:30,613
Things that wanted to hurt her?

286
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:34,408
A dead girl.

287
01:02:35,087 --> 01:02:36,628
There you go.

288
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:38,333
A dead girl.

289
01:02:39,382 --> 01:02:44,210
The girl you found. Sarah Dutreuil.
She saw insects. Cockroaches, everywhere.

290
01:02:44,513 --> 01:02:48,047
They we're crawling over her. She had rather
chopped off her arm then to go through that.

291
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:51,220
People don't want to suffer anymore.

292
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,894
The world has come to a point

293
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:58,020
that there are only victims left.

294
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,316
Martyrs are rare.

295
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:06,570
A martyr, that's something else...

296
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:09,232
A martyrs is
an exceptional being.

297
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:12,702
It survives suffering,
the lacking of everything.

298
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:15,570
We burden it with
all the evil of the world,

299
01:03:15,749 --> 01:03:19,663
and he transcends himself.

300
01:03:19,836 --> 01:03:23,703
Do you understand that?
He changes shapes..

301
01:03:28,594 --> 01:03:31,381
Longsheng, 1912.

302
01:03:32,389 --> 01:03:34,050
That women doesn't believe in God.

303
01:03:34,225 --> 01:03:37,428
She tried to steal a chicken.
And she pays a high price.

304
01:03:37,812 --> 01:03:41,678
The moment the picture was taken...
she's still alive. Look at her eyes.

305
01:03:45,068 --> 01:03:47,025
Jouans-Lussac, 1945.

306
01:03:47,195 --> 01:03:49,732
That woman is a grocer.
She slept with a German.

307
01:03:49,906 --> 01:03:52,527
Back then the French were sensitive.
She had to pay.

308
01:03:53,326 --> 01:03:56,410
She's still alive. Look at her eyes.

309
01:03:57,788 --> 01:04:01,406
Central Hospital of Birmingham, 1960.

310
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:04,794
The atheistic housekeeper
without a story

311
01:04:04,961 --> 01:04:07,962
was terminally ill
and the morphine had no effect anymore.

312
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:10,049
Look at her eyes.

313
01:04:10,591 --> 01:04:13,711
This one was beaten up by her husband.
Jealousy...

314
01:04:14,011 --> 01:04:16,253
This one just spent 9 hours
in the wreckage of her car.

315
01:04:16,555 --> 01:04:19,473
This young leukemia patient
is dying. The pains gnawing.

316
01:04:19,767 --> 01:04:23,929
This woman has a rare disease.
She suffered for nine hours.

317
01:04:24,229 --> 01:04:26,103
Look at their eyes. Look.

318
01:04:26,523 --> 01:04:28,730
All of them. Do you hear me?

319
01:04:29,652 --> 01:04:32,854
They were all alive
when these pictures were taken.

320
01:04:33,154 --> 01:04:36,155
So tell me again
that the idea of a martyr

321
01:04:36,449 --> 01:04:38,442
is an invention of
the religious world.

322
01:04:38,618 --> 01:04:40,776
We've tried everything.
Even children.

323
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:43,616
It's proven that women

324
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:47,577
are more sensitive for
a transformation.

325
01:04:49,044 --> 01:04:50,787
Young women.

326
01:04:52,463 --> 01:04:53,578
That's how it is.

327
01:19:41,535 --> 01:19:42,698
Anna?

328
01:19:43,787 --> 01:19:44,950
Are you there?

329
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,992
I'm here.

330
01:19:47,165 --> 01:19:49,738
Anna?
- Yes, Lucie.

331
01:19:50,376 --> 01:19:52,416
Why are you never afraid?

332
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:54,211
Sometimes I'm afraid.

333
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:55,915
Not like me.

334
01:19:56,131 --> 01:19:58,124
I didn't go through the same thing as you.

335
01:19:59,927 --> 01:20:01,966
What do you have to do
to stop being afraid?

336
01:20:02,387 --> 01:20:04,463
I think you have to let yourself go.

337
01:20:05,098 --> 01:20:06,508
Do you think so?

338
01:20:06,849 --> 01:20:08,427
Let oneself go.

339
01:20:09,769 --> 01:20:12,094
If I can't do it,
will you be there for me?

340
01:20:12,271 --> 01:20:13,185
Yes.

341
01:20:13,356 --> 01:20:15,016
I miss you.

342
01:21:50,487 --> 01:21:52,978
You're not afraid anymore, Anna.

343
01:21:58,996 --> 01:22:00,786
You're not afraid anymore, Anna.

344
01:22:05,835 --> 01:22:07,211
You're not afraid anymore.

345
01:22:39,157 --> 01:22:40,901
It will be okay, Anna.

346
01:22:41,326 --> 01:22:42,867
It will be okay.

347
01:22:43,577 --> 01:22:45,784
The suffering is almost over.

348
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:49,951
There's one stage left.

349
01:22:50,919 --> 01:22:52,294
The last one.

350
01:22:53,045 --> 01:22:56,912
It will be OK.
You don't have to defend yourself anymore.

351
01:22:57,091 --> 01:22:58,633
It's OK, Anna.

352
01:26:57,103 --> 01:26:59,144
Is she persevering?
It's amazing.

353
01:27:34,471 --> 01:27:36,879
Michel!
- What is it?

354
01:27:46,774 --> 01:27:48,981
Now. I went to feed her.
A few minutes ago.

355
01:27:49,152 --> 01:27:51,525
Are you sure?
- Like I said,

356
01:27:51,822 --> 01:27:54,146
I never saw an expression like that.

357
01:27:54,323 --> 01:27:58,403
She's liberated. Completely liberated.
Here face is like...

358
01:27:58,578 --> 01:28:01,199
Miss, her eyes...

359
01:28:01,372 --> 01:28:04,077
She doesn't see
what's happening around her.

360
01:28:04,249 --> 01:28:07,535
But is she still...
- She's still alive.

361
01:31:02,205 --> 01:31:03,865
Did you see it?

362
01:31:07,919 --> 01:31:09,876
The other world?

363
01:32:41,547 --> 01:32:45,045
Yesterday, in the afternoon,

364
01:32:45,675 --> 01:32:48,083
around 12:15,

365
01:32:48,386 --> 01:32:50,878
Anna Assaoui was martyred.

366
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:55,298
I ask you with the utmost respect
to think of her.

367
01:32:56,102 --> 01:32:58,854
Anna Assaoui
is an exceptional being.

368
01:32:59,272 --> 01:33:01,430
In the 17 years
of trying

369
01:33:01,733 --> 01:33:04,853
she's only the fourth
to reach this stage.

370
01:33:05,153 --> 01:33:08,568
And the first, yes, the first...

371
01:33:08,906 --> 01:33:11,942
to make known
what she has seen.

372
01:33:12,242 --> 01:33:15,446
Between 12:15 and 2:30,

373
01:33:15,746 --> 01:33:19,078
Miss Assaoui clearly saw
what comes after death.

374
01:33:19,582 --> 01:33:20,910
You heard well.

375
01:33:21,209 --> 01:33:24,625
Her ecstatic state
lasted for 2 hours and 15 minutes.

376
01:33:24,796 --> 01:33:28,210
It was not a near-death experience.

377
01:33:28,507 --> 01:33:31,045
What she experienced,
was an authentic martyrdom.

378
01:33:31,343 --> 01:33:33,750
At 2:30 she left that state.

379
01:33:34,471 --> 01:33:37,305
And at 3:05 she spoke.

380
01:33:37,723 --> 01:33:40,594
At this moment she is still alive.

381
01:33:41,019 --> 01:33:42,846
But she isn't talking anymore.

382
01:33:43,146 --> 01:33:46,313
Miss heard her testimony.

383
01:33:46,608 --> 01:33:49,312
That testimony, my dear friends,

384
01:33:49,485 --> 01:33:51,940
will be shared in a few moments.

385
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:03,861
Miss...

386
01:34:04,415 --> 01:34:06,123
they are waiting.

387
01:34:06,668 --> 01:34:08,825
I'm coming, Etienne.

388
01:34:14,383 --> 01:34:16,625
So there IS something?

389
01:34:16,969 --> 01:34:18,628
Of course.

390
01:34:19,887 --> 01:34:21,263
Was it clear?

391
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:25,433
Very clear.

392
01:34:26,602 --> 01:34:28,061
And precise?

393
01:34:30,021 --> 01:34:33,391
There was no room
for interpretation, Etienne.

394
01:34:36,154 --> 01:34:37,945
Thank you, Miss.

395
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:46,569
Etienne?

396
01:34:49,457 --> 01:34:50,915
Miss?

397
01:34:51,709 --> 01:34:55,042
Could you imagine
what comes after death?

398
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,540
Are you OK?

399
01:34:59,841 --> 01:35:02,332
Could you?
- No, I...

400
01:35:05,013 --> 01:35:06,127
Keep doubting, Etienne.

401
01:35:14,438 --> 01:35:16,727
martyr:

402
01:35:16,899 --> 01:35:18,938
noun

403
01:35:19,109 --> 01:35:22,110
from the Greek word "marturos"

404
01:35:22,279 --> 01:35:26,573
witness
