Ed and Lorraine Warren,

And now we're gonna talk to my next guest,

223
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,846
Dr. Steven Kaplan, who says that the
investigations the Warrens conducted

224
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,402
into the Amityville haunting
is a load of hogwash.

225
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,011
Why is that?

226
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,046
Well, it's been well established
that Amityville was a blatant hoax.

227
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,645
- But that hasn't stopped...
- That's never been proven.

Yes, it has.

229
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,528
The Lutz family made everything up so
they could profit off of all the publicity.

230
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,125
That's just not true.

Look, we see this all the time.

It's very easy to sit on the outside

been there and experienced it for yourself.

00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,642
Behind the doors of this
seemingly normal house

562
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,482
in Ponders End, North London,
is a family living in a nightmare.

563
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,725
HAZEL: I look up, and through the window,
plain as day, I see the younger girl,

564
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,089
Janet, being thrown around in the air
like she was floating.

565
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,967
So we run back inside and sure enough

566
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,963
there's little toy LEGO bricks
flying all around the room.

567
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,600
One of them hit me right in the face
so hard it drew blood.

568
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,411
CONSTABLE HEEPS:
I saw the chair slide by itself,

569
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,245
across the floor,
a distance of several feet.

570
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,802
I checked the chair for wires,
but could find nothing to explain it.

571
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,241
ALLEN: Maurice Grosse is an
engineering consultant

572
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,244
and has been investigating these claims
for the Society of Psychical Research.

573
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,085
Well, I don't think there's
any doubt about it at all.

574
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:12,044
The sheer number of documented incidents
in this case is absolutely staggering.

575
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,600
But, Anita Gregory, a parapsychologist and
lecturer at the Polytechnic of North London,

576
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,921
is not convinced.

577
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,766
Our principal characters here
are all children.

578
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,763
And children can be
very ingenious pranksters.

579
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,364
At the center of these frightening
activities is 11-year-old Janet Hodgson.

580
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,604
I recently interviewed Janet
and her 14-year-old sister, Margaret.

581

before all this.

since Mr. Grosse started talking to it.

(INDISTINCT TALKING)

1055
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,846
GRAHAM: This is the bite wound
Janet received the first night.

1056
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,527
It's faded a bit here,
but you can still make it out.

1057
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,122
Wow. That's pretty distinctive.

1058
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,486
Two missing teeth.

1059
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,688
MAURICE: That's right. And it's too big
for one of the children.

1060
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,286
You think this was the spirit?
This Bill Wilkins?

1061
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,891
I tracked down the home owner.

1062
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,447
And it turns out,
the owner's father lived there.

1063
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,924
His name was William Wilkins and he died
of a hemorrhage in the brain in that chair.

1064
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,851
Everything she said is true.

1065
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,485
All public information, by the way.

1066
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,523
She could have heard
the whole story from a neighbor.

1067
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,651
LORRAINE: And what about the claims

1068
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,361
that Janet has been teleporting
around the house in her sleep?

1069
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:37,490
About as valid as their claims
of her levitating off the bed.

1070
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,848
Were any of you there when it happened?

1071
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,082
No. But I have pictures of that too.

1072
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,765
Yeah. There you go.

1073
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,042
I set my camera up in the girls' room

1074
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,328
and then waited downstairs
with the remote control.

1075
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,727
And fired it off whenever
I heard any commotion.

1076
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,490
I have to admit.

1077
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,803
The way her knees are bent,
the upright position of her body.

1078
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,200
It looks like she's just jumping.

1079
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,249
What are you saying?
I mean, you were there last night.

1080
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,526
You saw it with your own eyes.

1081
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:05,202
Well, Peggy was the one who
saw someone attacking Janet.

1082
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,681
But she teleported herself into a room

1083
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,047
locked from the outside,
for goodness' sake.

1084
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,844
And what about her voice?

1085
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,365
How do we explain that?

1086
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,205
I think the first time
she was making that voice

1087
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,289
it was in front of television cameras.

1088
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:21,481
And she couldn't do it with water
in her mouth until you looked away.

1089
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:25,364
So she could have spit it out,
taken another sip before you turned back.

1090
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,846
Last year, I was conned by a Welsh family
pretending to be possessed by demons.

1091
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,048
(SCOFFS) Honestly,
I don't know what was worse,

1092
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:36,569
the demons or the people who prey
on our willingness to believe in them.

1093
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,810
The demons are worse.

1094
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,443
But you must admit, it is suspicious.

1095
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,047
You sincerely believe
that she's faking everything?

1096
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,247
And what about Peggy?

1097
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,442
She's just using the whole
thing as an excuse

1098
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,364
to get better housing from the council.

1099
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,090
She's already applied!

1100
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,208
Look, I'm not saying it's a hoax.

1101
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,125
Sometimes, what we do
requires a leap of faith.

1102
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:01,964

1103
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,608

1104

Yes. We do.

1105

But the Church can't do
anything without proof.

Right, listen. I'll make
some telephone calls,

video recording equipment.

1109

In the meantime, Ed and I can be
spending time with Peggy and the kids,

1110
