1
00:00:04,828 --> 00:00:08,707
She's always in my hair

2
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,729
I hate scary movies. I should
be studying. You know I got a bio due.

3
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:32,939
Baby, did I mention that
these tickets were free?

4
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:36,902
Sandra Bullock is playing
right down the street.

5
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:40,697
Nobody wanna pay $7.50 see some Sandra
Bullock shit... unless she's naked.

6
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,826
Oh, but you will sit through
a movie called Stab?

7
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,996
It's adrenaline, Maureen.
It's good to be scared.

8
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,998
It's primal.
You know what I'm sayin'?

9
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:52,000
No, I'm gonna tell you
what it is, okay?

10
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,753
It's a dumb-ass white movie
about some dumb-ass white girls...

11
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:58,882
gettin' their white asses
cut the fuck up, okay?

12
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:01,635
Yeah. I suppose Sandra Bullock
is Miss Ethnicity, right?

13
00:01:01,718 --> 00:01:04,804
Well, no, all I'm saying is that
the horror genre is historical...

14
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:06,848
for excluding
the African-American element.

15
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:10,393
When the hell you get your Ph. D.
In Black Cinema, Sister Souljah?

16
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:14,397
Listen, I read my Entertainment Weekly,
okay? I know my shit.

17
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,067
Yeah, Maureen. I read my
Black Beat, too, homey.

18
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:20,862
Tonight we're going to have an all-black movie,
all-black cast, all-black wardrobe, black eyes-

19
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:23,782
Everything.
Black-eyed peas. Black cats-

20
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:26,409
- Crazy.
- Thank you.

21
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:28,787
- Hi. Here you go.
- What's this?

22
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,789
Stab souvenirs.
The studio send them.

23
00:01:30,872 --> 00:01:33,333
Hah!
And it's white.

24
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:36,002
- Thanks.

25
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:38,213
Thank you.

26
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:48,390
Kill! Kill! Kill!

27
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,684
Very romantic.

28
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:59,150
Whoa!

29
00:03:03,673 --> 00:03:05,717
Whoo! Take it off!

30
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:11,723
Now, why has she got
to be naked?

31
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:14,976
What does that have to do with the plot
of the story, her being butt-ass naked?

32
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,395
I don't know about the plot,
but I got a stiff one.

33
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,731
You better loosen up
that wrist.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

35
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:42,170
Hello?

36
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:44,214
Hello.

37
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,759
- Who is this?
- Guess.

38
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:51,763
- No, really. Who is this?
- Were you expecting somebody?

39
00:03:52,806 --> 00:03:55,642
- No.

40
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:58,853
Bitch, hang the phone up
and Star-69 his ass! Damn!

41
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:01,064
- Shh!

42
00:04:01,147 --> 00:04:02,774
- Who is this?
- Who would you like it to be?

43
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:06,903
I don't like games.
Who is this?

44
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:09,197
Look out back.

45
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:14,953
You see your boyfriend
anywhere?

46
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:17,539
I don't even have
a boyfriend right now.

47
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:20,041
Would you like one?

48
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,378
Damn it all. Can I- Give me some money.
I need to get some popcorn.

49
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:27,674
- You got money.
- I asked for your money.

50
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:30,051
What do you say?

51
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,387
Cheap ass.

52
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,974
- Thank you.
- Come on.

53
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:38,101
Cat got your tongue?

54
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:41,479
You know, I don't even know you,
and I dislike you already.

55
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:54,201
Come on!

56
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:58,371
- Hey, we're sold out.
- Oh, cool!

57
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:03,043
Hello.

58
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:08,882
Hi. Um, can I have a medium popcorn,
no butter, and a small diet Pepsi?

59
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:10,884
- You got it.
- Thanks.

60
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,886
That's it. I am not
going back in there.

61
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:15,138
Come on, you chickenshit.
It's just a movie.

62
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,390
No, it's not just a movie.
It's a true story.

63
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:19,643
All these kids got killed
a couple years ago in California.

64
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:22,312
- Here's the popcorn.
- Thanks.

65
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:25,899
I was so scared,
I almost had a heart attack.

66
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:28,777
Hah!
Stab you, man!

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Whoa!

68
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,836
- You ass!
- I'm sorry. I had to, baby.

69
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:50,090
- What are you playing?
- Would you relax?

70
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:52,092
God! What's wrong with you?

71
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:54,844
I don't like being scared.
I don't like that.

72
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:57,722
Baby, it's just
a movie.

73
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:00,684
Besides, scary movies
are great foreplay.

74
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:03,436
Excuse me?

75
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,480
Let's go see
Sandra Bullock.

76
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:10,402
Oh, no. Sandra started already.
We can stay.

77
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:12,571
Just stop playin' so much.

78
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:18,994
All right. I gotta go
to the bathroom.

79
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:22,414
See ya inside.

80
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,359
Sorry.

81
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:37,113
Hello?

82
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

83
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:53,732
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Don't do that!

84
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:02,908
Move! Move!
Go!

85
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:04,910
All right, go!

86
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,209
Baby, give it up.

87
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:16,838
You came back just in time.
It looks like she's about to get it.

88
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:18,840
Want some popcorn?

89
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:25,931
Uh-uh. See, if that was me,
I would be out of there.

90
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:35,065
Oh!
Here it comes!

91
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:38,235
- Here it comes!

92
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:40,403
Here it comes!
Oh, my God!

93
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:47,572
Whoa, oh, oh

94
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:52,118
This could be
your lucky day

95
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:56,957
In hell

96
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,044
- Never know who it might be

97
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:03,296
At your doorbell

98
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:10,929
This could be
your lucky day

99
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:15,559
In hell

100
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:19,938
Hello?

101
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,401
- Hello?
- Hello, Sidney.

102
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:28,321
- Yes?
- What's your favorite scary movie?

103
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:32,242
- Who is this?
- You tell me.

104
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:38,665
Cory Gillis,
555-0176.

105
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:40,792
- Oh, shit!
- Hot flash, Cory-

106
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:42,794
- Shit!
- Crank calls are a criminal offense...

107
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:45,171
prosecuted under
penal code 653-M.

108
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:49,175
Hope you enjoyed
the movie.

109
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:51,344
Time to change
numbers again?

110
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:53,346
No. It'll die off.

111
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,473
It's opening weekend.
We'll see how it goes.

112
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,475
Okay.

113
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:00,937
You know, Ron, uh,

114
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:03,940
it's not an easy thing to be accused
of a crime you didn't commit,

115
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:07,444
particularly one
as heinous as murder.

116
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,446
But how do people treat you
now that they know the truth...

117
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:11,448
- about your innocence?
- Most people are cool.

118
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:14,451
There's some who still keep
a safe distance, which is odd for me,

119
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:16,703
'cause I've always been
sort of a people person.

120
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:19,206
But you were
wrongly accused!

121
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:21,208
You were fully exonerated.

122
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,959
Yeah, well, that and a nickel
will get you a cup of coffee.

123
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:25,629
- Even that's not true anymore.

124
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:27,714
Well, certainly, with Gale Weathers'
book- and now the movie-

125
00:13:27,797 --> 00:13:31,551
- it's set the record straight for Cotton Weary.
- One would think.

126
00:13:31,635 --> 00:13:33,386
But, uh, Gale's-
Gale's been terrific.

127
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,972
Hey! Move your ass, okay?
You're late.

128
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:40,352
Don't forget about the martini mixer
tonight at the Delta Lambda Zetas.

129
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:43,813
- I don't think I'm going to be able to make it, Hal.
- What?

130
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:46,858
Don't even try to bag, okay?
'Cause you promised me.

131
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:50,237
- A vague promise at best.
- Nobody's asking you to join, okay?

132
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,405
It's a party.
Free beer, meet the girls.

133
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:54,407
Hallie, you know me
and organized religion.

134
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:56,826
- It's a sorority.
- Worse.

135
00:13:56,868 --> 00:14:00,205
Look, Sid, just lower the walls
for the next few days.

136
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:03,542
This self-induced isolation
you got goin' is not healthy.

137
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,086
- I'm fine.
- "I'm fine."

138
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:10,215
Yes, I know. "I'm fine" is stretched
tightly across your face.

139
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:12,217
Check out the news.

140
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:19,432
The two Windsor College
students were murdered...

141
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:23,186
last night during a sneak preview
of the new movie Stab.

142
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,773
Police haven't released any information
except for the victims' names,

143
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:29,818
but a press conference is scheduled
for later today.

144
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:32,821
The victims, Maureen Evans
and Phil Stevens,

145
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:34,823
were both Windsor seniors.

146
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:38,368
- Where's Randy?
- He's got Film Theory this morning.

147
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,453
...ended with the brutal murders
of two promising-

148
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:52,132
Sidney! Sidney!

149
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:54,134
Sidney, did you know
the victims?

150
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:56,136
- Do you feel threatened by the murders?
- No comment.

151
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:58,138
- Do you think there'll be more murders?
- Sidney! Sidney!

152
00:14:58,221 --> 00:15:00,432
- What can you tell us about the victims?
- How about the police?

153
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:03,351
- We just need one statement.
- Please talk to us!

154
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,813
You could say what happened in that
theater is a result of the movie itself.

155
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:10,984
That is so Moral Majority. You can't
blame real violence on entertainment.

156
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:14,446
What? Wait a second. Yes, you can.
Don't you even watch the news?

157
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:16,948
Yeah. Hello! The murderer was wearing
a ghost mask, okay?

158
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,326
Just like in the movie.
It's directly responsible.

159
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:22,120
No, it's not. Movies are not responsible
for our actions.

160
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:26,249
It's a classic case of life
imitating art imitating life.

161
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,710
This is not a hypothetical.
It's not about art.

162
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:31,421
I had Biology with that girl.
This is reality.

163
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:35,258
Thank you. I agree with you.
Let me tell you about reality, Mickey.

164
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,260
I lived through this.
Okay?

165
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:39,429
Life is life.
It doesn't imitate anything.

166
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:41,806
Come on, Randy,
with all due respect,

167
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,517
the killer obviously patterned himself
after two serial killers...

168
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:47,729
- who have been immortalized on film.
- Thank you.

169
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:50,232
Are you suggesting that someone's trying
to make a real-life sequel?

170
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:54,069
Stab 2? Who'd want to do that?
Sequels suck.

171
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:56,071
- Oh, please. Please!

172
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:59,282
- By definition alone, they're inferior films.
- Bullshit generalization.

173
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:01,451
Many sequels have
surpassed their original.

174
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,995
- Oh, yeah?
- Name one.

175
00:16:04,037 --> 00:16:05,580
Aliens. Far better
than the first.

176
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,541
Yeah, well, there's
no accounting for taste.

177
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:09,793
Thank you. Ridley Scott rules.
Name another.

178
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:14,214
No. Aliens is a classic, okay?
"Get away from her, you bitch!"

179
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:16,967
Believe the line is "Stay away from her,
you bitch. " It's film class, right?

180
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:21,137
- Whatever. You know what I mean.
- Another.

181
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,722
- T2.
- Mmm.

182
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:24,516
You've got a hard-on
for Cameron.

183
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,643
- Big one.
- Wait a second.

184
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,563
- The first Terminator is historical.
- Yeah.

185
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:32,566
"Sarah Connor?"
"Yes."

186
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:34,568
- All right. All right, okay.

187
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:36,945
House Il:
The Second Story.

188
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:42,576
- What?
- The entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels.

189
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:44,953
Hey, I got it, by the way.
I got it.

190
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:47,122
The Godfather, Part II.

191
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:53,712
Very good.
That's the Oscar-winning exception.

192
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,840
- All right, that's enough.

193
00:16:56,923 --> 00:17:02,387
That'll be a wrap. The sequel discussion
to be continued.

194
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,059
So, Mr. Originality, how would
you make it different?

195
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:10,562
I'd let the geek
get the girl.

196
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:18,069
Three hundred people watched.
Nobody did anything.

197
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:20,405
They thought it was a publicity stunt,
for Christ's sakes.

198
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:22,449
And it would have been a good one too.

199
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:24,451
- It's starting again, Randy.
- It's not.

200
00:17:24,534 --> 00:17:27,746
Shit happens at the movies. People
get robbed, shot, maimed, murdered.

201
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,749
Multiplex is just a very dangerous place
to be these days.

202
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,959
Yeah, and you are
in extreme denial.

203
00:17:33,043 --> 00:17:35,629
And you should be too.
This has nothing to do with us.

204
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:37,631
Randy, a guy in a ghost mask
hacked up two people...

205
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:40,342
in a movie theater
telling our life story.

206
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:44,179
- Coincidence?
- You know what happened at Woodsboro.

207
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:47,682
- You can't ignore it.
- I know, Sid, but I don't want to go back there again.

208
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,227
Can't we just go back to our
pseudo-quasi-happy existence?

209
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:53,855
- Hello, Derek. How ya doin'?
- Hey, Sid.

210
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,274
- I heard. You weren't in class.
- Yeah, I know.

211
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:58,985
I skipped. I couldn't take all
the "that's her" looks.

212
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:00,987
Is there anything
I can do?

213
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:02,989
Well, you got any tricks
for getting me back...

214
00:18:03,073 --> 00:18:05,867
to a pseudo-quasi-
happy existence?

215
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,954
- I might just have one for that.
- Yeah?

216
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:10,956
Oh, yeah?
What is it?

217
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,588
That was pretty good.

218
00:18:20,382 --> 00:18:22,300
Get a room.

219
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,188
They're threatening to what?
Are you kidding me?

220
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:38,066
They'd be stupid
to pull this movie.

221
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:41,278
With all this free press, they're
gonna have huge numbers this weekend.

222
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:43,488
It'll break
box office records.

223
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:46,908
- Consider it done.

224
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,910
Uh, Miss Weathers?
Hi. I'm Joel.

225
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,121
The affiliate sent me.
I'm your new cameraman.

226
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:53,164
- Yeah. You got experience?
- Huh? Uh, yeah.

227
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:55,542
I mean, I'm local,
but I shot the bingo finals.

228
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,544
- Great. Great.
- I almost got an award for that.

229
00:18:57,627 --> 00:18:59,546
All right, listen, Joel.
This is how it works.

230
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:01,548
I point, you shoot.

231
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:03,884
You stay focussed and fast on your feet,
and we'll get along fine.

232
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,886
You're playing with the big boys now,
you got it?

233
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:07,888
Got it! Got you covered.
I'm all over it.

234
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:09,890
Don't worry about a thing.
How hard can it be?

235
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:11,892
You point and I shoot.
I'm there!

236
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:13,977
Excuse me, Miss Weathers?
Uh, could I have a minute?

237
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,146
- No.
- Just one second.

238
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:18,148
I- I know you probably
get this all the time,

239
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,150
but I just wanted to say
I am such a big fan of your work.

240
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,569
I just finished you book.
I- I couldn't put it down.

241
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:25,906
Insightful, probing-
I just really, really loved your book.

242
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:28,867
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Sure.

243
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,869
I'm a writer myself.

244
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:32,871
I write for the local paper,
for the Post Telegram.

245
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:36,875
I'm Debbie Salt. I took your seminar
in Chicago last year.

246
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:40,086
I was the one in the front row asking
all the questions.

247
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,839
- Right. I thought you looked familiar.
- Oh, thank you.

248
00:19:42,923 --> 00:19:44,925
Um, can't wait
to see the movie.

249
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:47,052
You know, you must be getting
quite a lot of flak on that, right?

250
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:49,679
I mean, with all the
violence-in-cinema issues.

251
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:51,932
What is your position
going to be?

252
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:53,934
- No comment.
- Miss Weathers, please- I would-

253
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:56,770
It would be an honor for me if I could
just get a quote from you for my story.

254
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:58,772
Okay. Begin quote:

255
00:19:58,855 --> 00:20:01,566
- Great.
- "Your flattering remarks are both desperate and obvious."

256
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,568
- Ouch!
- End quote.

257
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:06,571
Gale, what are you doing here? Do you think
these murders are connected to Sidney Prescott?

258
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:08,573
Miss Weathers, what's your theory
on these murders?

259
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:10,575
What's your feeling
about this?

260
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,619
May I have your attention.

261
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:15,705
- My name is Chief Louis Hartley-
- Chief Hartley.

262
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:19,584
Hi. Gale Weathers,
author of The Woodsboro Murders.

263
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:21,711
Do you think the killer
will strike again?

264
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:25,173
We have no evidence
that this is a serial killer.

265
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,175
- I'd like to read from a prepared-
- Can you tell us of any...

266
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,344
precautions
that you're taking?

267
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:32,847
Well, first of all, we think it's just
an isolated incident,

268
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:36,476
- and we will be-
- Ladies.

269
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,478
Oh, my God.
This is huge.

270
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:40,647
Do you have
any suspects?

271
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,316
- Sidney, look. It's Gale Weathers.
- What?

272
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,360
Star of the Gale Weathers
press conference,

273
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,362
based on the book
by Gale Weathers.

274
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:50,490
Soon to be a major motion picture
starring Gale Weathers.

275
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:54,119
- Be kind. She saved our lives.
- She had calf implants.

276
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:57,122
Chief Hartley, do you plan
on giving the town a curfew?

277
00:20:57,163 --> 00:20:59,124
I'm gonna get closer.

278
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,671
- So that's her?
- Yeah.

279
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,968
Hello, girls.
Enjoying yourselves?

280
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,971
- Hello, Sister Lois, Sister Murphy.
- Hello, pledge. Hi, Sidney.

281
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:17,350
- Hey.
- This must be flat-out hell for you.

282
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:20,687
- How are you holding up?
- I manage.

283
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,149
It's really weird, isn't it? To think
this fuss is all because of you!

284
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:28,445
I mean, not directly, but in some
six-degrees-of-Kevin Bacon way.

285
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:33,742
Hallie, are you gonna bring your friend
to our little martini mixer tonight?

286
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:37,245
- I have a lot of work to do.
- We'll be there.

287
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,248
Oh, good. Because Sid,
we have our eyes on you.

288
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,667
You hang in there, and if there's
anything we can do-

289
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:46,254
The Delta Lambdas are very sensitive
to your plight.

290
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,548
- Yeah. Bye!
- Bye!

291
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:54,387
- You gonna start to dress like that once you get in?
- That's not gonna happen.

292
00:21:54,471 --> 00:21:57,474
The Delta Lambdas are the biggest
bunch of fuckin'-

293
00:21:57,557 --> 00:22:00,310
Hey! I'm pledging
Delta Lambda, thank you.

294
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,731
Oh, my God.

295
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,319
Who's that?

296
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,281
Dewey?

297
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,826
Hey!

298
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,205
- What are you doing here?
- Ah!

299
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:23,083
- Oh, I was worried about you.
- Yeah?

300
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,252
I heard about what happened
and I was on the next plane.

301
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:27,254
- Oh.
- Can we talk?

302
00:22:27,337 --> 00:22:29,256
Yeah. Yeah.

303
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,259
Are you okay?

304
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:36,096
I'm fine, Dewey,
or I was.

305
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:39,933
I mean, things were okay
until now.

306
00:22:40,016 --> 00:22:43,061
But, uh,
theater's going great.

307
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:46,356
I got my first starring role.
We open in two days.

308
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,650
- That is great.
- Yeah. I'm loving it.

309
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:50,652
You know, and I've got
some great friends,

310
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:54,239
and, uh,
I'm seeing someone.

311
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:58,368
Nice guy. Premed,
no apparent psychotic tendencies.

312
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,205
I was just worried.

313
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:08,128
Look, Sid, if there is some
freaked-out psycho trying to follow...

314
00:23:08,211 --> 00:23:11,715
in Billy Loomis's footsteps,
you probably already know him.

315
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:15,218
Or her, or them.

316
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:18,179
They're probably
already in your life.

317
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:21,808
They get off on that.

318
00:23:21,892 --> 00:23:24,728
I just want you
to be careful, Sid.

319
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,278
Oh, you- You think I don't
know that, Dewey?

320
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:36,489
But what am I
supposed to do?

321
00:23:36,573 --> 00:23:40,869
Just cut everybody off?
Crawl under a rock? What?

322
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:48,585
Just watch out.
Keep an eye out.

323
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:51,922
I'm gonna talk to Chief Hartley
and the local police.

324
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:55,091
I'm gonna
just hang around.

325
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:59,012
I wanna make sure you're safe,
if that's all right with you.

326
00:23:59,095 --> 00:24:01,014
Yeah.
I'd be honored.

327
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:06,353
All right, Sid.

328
00:24:14,945 --> 00:24:19,199
Hey.

329
00:24:19,282 --> 00:24:21,201
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

330
00:24:21,284 --> 00:24:23,203
- Who was that guy?
- An old friend.

331
00:24:23,286 --> 00:24:25,580
Deputy Dewey, Woodsboro's finest.
What's he doing here?

332
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:28,583
He's worried.
Our surrogate big brother.

333
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,419
Nothing like a funeral to bring
the family together.

334
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,005
I'm gonna go say hi.

335
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:38,051
- Chief Hartley said the girl
was stabbed seven- - Drop it.

336
00:24:38,134 --> 00:24:40,053
Hello, Sidney.

337
00:24:40,136 --> 00:24:43,807
- How are you?
- Hi. What do you want, Gale?

338
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:47,394
Well, I was hoping I might get
just a few words with you.

339
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:53,149
- Cotton.
- Hi, Sidney.

340
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,485
Here we are at Windsor College,
where Sidney Prescott...

341
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,238
has just been reunited with Cotton Weary
for the first time...

342
00:24:58,321 --> 00:25:00,824
since she wrongly accused
him of murdering her mother.

343
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,743
- What the hell are you doing?
- We want to know how you feel.

344
00:25:03,827 --> 00:25:06,454
Tell us everything that's happened,
looking back on the last two years.

345
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,916
Sidney, I'd just like to say
that I forgive and forget,

346
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,086
and just like you, I'd like to get
back on with my own life.

347
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:15,714
- Do you have any comments?
- You bitch!

348
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:17,924
- Ah-ah.
- Deep breaths. Lot of deep breaths.

349
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:20,677
Oh, Sidney,
share with us, please!

350
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,013
- I'll share with you!
- Okay, okay, okay.

351
00:25:23,096 --> 00:25:25,056
Did you get that
on film?

352
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:26,892
Yes, I got that
on film.

353
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:29,227
Sid? Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

354
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:31,855
Where's she going, Gale?
Sidney?

355
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,024
Where's she going?

356
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,026
Gale, I-I thought we had
an official interview.

357
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,278
What's going on?
She didn't know?

358
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:42,407
- Man, that was cold.
- Hey, you need to check your conscience at the door, sweetie.

359
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,409
I'm not here
to be loved.

360
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:46,411
Gale, you promised me ten minutes
of national coverage.

361
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:48,413
You'll get
your ten minutes...

362
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:51,541
when I get
my goddamn interview.

363
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,960
Don't walk away from me, Gale.
I'm still-

364
00:25:54,044 --> 00:25:56,504
Gale, I did my part!

365
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,506
Joel!

366
00:26:03,553 --> 00:26:06,097
Dewey.

367
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:08,099
What are you
doing here?

368
00:26:08,183 --> 00:26:10,310
Why don't you just
leave her alone?

369
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:12,521
Hasn't she been
through enough?

370
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:16,066
And my name is Dwight.

371
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:19,486
I was just doing my job,
Dwight.

372
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:23,240
- No matter who gets hurt in the process?
- Hey!

373
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,492
Who got punched here-
again?

374
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:29,246
Well, I don't condone violence,
but maybe you deserved it.

375
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:33,208
Page 32: "Deputy Dewey
filled the room...

376
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,460
with his Barney Fife-ish
presence."

377
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:37,879
You read my book.

378
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,048
Oh, yes, I do read,
Miss Weathers.

379
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,093
Oh, Dewey, don't take it so seriously.
It's a character in a book.

380
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,846
Page 41:

381
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,976
"Deputy Dewey oozed
with inexperience."

382
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,313
Don't you think you're overreacting
just a little bit?

383
00:26:55,355 --> 00:27:00,986
No. What I think is that you're a money-hungry,
fame-seeking- and forgive me for saying-

384
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:05,240
mediocre writer who's got a cold storage
shed where her heart should be.

385
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,450
No offense intended.

386
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,452
Dewey, I never meant
to imply-

387
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,580
How do you know that my
dimwitted inexperience isn't...

388
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:15,375
merely a subtle form of manipulation
used to lower people's expectations,

389
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:20,672
enhancing my ability to effectively
maneuver within any given situation?

390
00:27:28,972 --> 00:27:31,808
I'm sorry.

391
00:27:33,894 --> 00:27:36,229
I don't know
what else to say...

392
00:27:36,313 --> 00:27:39,482
except I'm sorry.

393
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:43,153
No. I'm the one
that's sorry.

394
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,322
I misjudged you.

395
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:48,074
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

396
00:27:48,158 --> 00:27:50,744
I have some oozing to do.

397
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,915
One more thing.

398
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:56,917
Nice streaks.

399
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:01,087
Well.

400
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,851
Hey, I am not
a sorority pusher.

401
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,853
I just think,
despite its trivialities,

402
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:21,274
it is a life-affirming, mentally stable,
healthy environment for you.

403
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:24,277
I mean,
look at this place.

404
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:27,239
I think you're taking your psych major
a little too seriously, Hallie.

405
00:28:27,322 --> 00:28:29,533
I'm fine.

406
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,160
Yeah? That's beginning
to become your theme song.

407
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:35,622
"I'm fine." Yeah- Fucked up,
insecure, neurotic and emotional.

408
00:28:35,705 --> 00:28:37,749
Sidney, you made it!

409
00:28:37,832 --> 00:28:40,794
Hi!
No, I really mean that.

410
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:42,796
- Hi.
- Hi.

411
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:44,881
Do you girls
want a drink?

412
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:49,761
Uh, well, actually, yeah, but
you know what? We'll get it ourselves.

413
00:28:57,727 --> 00:29:01,439
I love those guys.
Are they still together?

414
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:03,441
I haven't seen it
in, like, three weeks.

415
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:05,443
- No, they broke up again.
- Really?

416
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:07,445
Mm-hmm. Sarah found out
that Bailey slept with Gwen.

417
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:09,489
She dumped him, like,
two episodes ago.

418
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:11,491
I wish she'd get
her shit together.

419
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:14,536
- Hold on. Someone's calling.

420
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,538
Omega Beta Zeta.

421
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,540
Hello?

422
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:21,251
- Yes?
- Who is this?

423
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:24,296
- Cici. Who's this?
- Who do you think?

424
00:29:24,337 --> 00:29:26,798
Ted?
Where are you?

425
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,593
Are you drinking?
Hold on.

426
00:29:29,676 --> 00:29:33,346
Ted's on the other line.
He sounds drunk. I'll call you back.

427
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,515
That shit only calls you
when he's drunk.

428
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,518
- Don't go over there, Cici.
- All right. I'll call you back.

429
00:29:41,897 --> 00:29:44,441
Okay, Ted. You sound loaded.
What's up?

430
00:29:44,524 --> 00:29:46,484
Who's Ted?

431
00:29:46,526 --> 00:29:49,029
Oh, I'm sorry.
My bad.

432
00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:51,031
I thought you were
someone else.

433
00:29:51,114 --> 00:29:53,033
That's okay.
I am.

434
00:29:53,116 --> 00:29:55,577
Who are you calling for?
Nobody's here.

435
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,579
Where is everybody?

436
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,916
We're cosponsoring the acid rain mixer
at Phi Gamma Alpha tonight.

437
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,835
- Why aren't you there?
- I'm "sober sister."

438
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,588
I need to be here in case
a drunk sister calls and needs a ride.

439
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:10,008
- That's too bad.
- "Drink with your brain." That's our motto.

440
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,011
- Who are you calling for?
- What if I said you?

441
00:30:13,094 --> 00:30:16,306
What if I said good-bye?

442
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,475
Why would you
want to do that?

443
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:24,147
- Why do you always answer a question with a question?
- I'm inquisitive.

444
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:29,069
Yeah, and I'm impatient. Do you want
to leave a message for someone?

445
00:30:29,152 --> 00:30:32,239
Do you want to die
tonight, Cici?

446
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,747
Omega Beta Zeta.

447
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,749
So, was it Teddy?

448
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:45,544
No. It was some creep asshole
trying to scare me.

449
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:47,921
That movie Stab is
bringing out the crazies.

450
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,260
- Shit.
- What is it?

451
00:30:53,343 --> 00:30:55,303
- I heard a noise.
- Where?

452
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,347
Upstairs.

453
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:00,600
- Shit!

454
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:07,190
- Hello? Hello?
- Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

455
00:31:07,274 --> 00:31:09,317
- Die, die, die, die, die. - Stop it!

456
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,862
I can't believe you're alone
in that house.

457
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,864
- I don't think I'm alone.

458
00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:17,242
I'm out of here.

459
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,084
You're breaking up.
Where are you?

460
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:28,879
- Outside.
- Don't panic, Cici.

461
00:31:28,962 --> 00:31:31,882
- Call campus security.
- Okay.

462
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,848
Campus Security.

463
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,767
- Hi. I'm calling from the Omega Beta-
- I can't hear you. Hello?

464
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:45,061
Hello?

465
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:47,731
- Can you hear me now?
- Hello?

466
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,983
- Hello? Shit!

467
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:56,781
- Campus Security.
- Yes. I'm calling from-

468
00:31:56,823 --> 00:31:58,909
I can't hear you.
Hello?

469
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- I'm calling from Omega Beta Zeta house.
Look, someone
is harassing me.
- Hello? Shit!

470
00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:08,168
- Hey!

471
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:10,420
- Jesus, Dawnie, you scared me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

472
00:32:10,503 --> 00:32:12,464
Did anyone call for me?

473
00:32:12,505 --> 00:32:16,092
- What are you doing here?
- I live here, remember?

474
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,428
I just thought you were
going to the mixer.

475
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,389
Yeah, I am. I had to change,
so I'll be out of here now.

476
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,853
Omega Beta Zeta.

477
00:32:26,937 --> 00:32:29,439
- Is Cici there?
- Mm-hmm. Who's calling?

478
00:32:29,523 --> 00:32:33,401
- It's Ted.
- It's your ill-conceived boyfriend.

479
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,570
Okay, so, I'll
see you later.

480
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:39,032
And don't forget
to set the alarm.

481
00:32:39,115 --> 00:32:41,034
Bye.

482
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,667
Hello, Ted.

483
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:53,421
Wish it was Ted. Don't forget
to set the alarm.

484
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hello?

485
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:02,842
No! Please, no!

486
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:07,806
- No!

487
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:12,519
Never said I was innocent

488
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:15,897
I will burn in hell
for the things I've done to you

489
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,942
Never said
I was anything good

490
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:25,824
Everyone thinks that sororities
are just about blow jobs,

491
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:29,995
- but it's not true.
- We only promote safe, condomed sex.

492
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:32,789
See, we're about love,
respect and responsibility.

493
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:35,083
Harmonica style
is okay, right?

494
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,085
- Oh, yeah.
- Cocktail?

495
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,254
What took you so long?

496
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,673
And you know, Derek is
a Delta Lambda big brother.

497
00:35:41,756 --> 00:35:44,551
And we like to keep it
all in the family.

498
00:35:44,634 --> 00:35:48,054
Wow. You know, you girls have
really given me a lot to think about.

499
00:35:48,138 --> 00:35:50,056
Thanks.

500
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,309
It's working.
It's working.

501
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,103
- Hey, babe. You wanna dance?
- Oh, I'd love to...

502
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:58,815
with that tall, wide-shouldered
fraternity boy.

503
00:35:58,899 --> 00:36:01,860
- Think you can arrange that?
- That hurts.

504
00:36:01,902 --> 00:36:06,156
The Empire Strikes Back. It
was a better story, improved effects.

505
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:08,658
Not a sequel. It was part of a trilogy.
Completely planned.

506
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,660
I like those
little furry things.

507
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,662
They're Ewoks.
They blow.

508
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,664
Hey.

509
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,666
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

510
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,669
- Twits being nice to you?
- Painfully nice.

511
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:22,672
I take it you will not be pledging
Delta Lambda Zeta.

512
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:25,217
I think not.

513
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:27,844
- I'm crushed.
- Hey, guys.

514
00:36:27,928 --> 00:36:29,888
Something is up
at Omega Beta Zeta.

515
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,682
- Police are everywhere.
- Hurry!

516
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:36,019
Come on, let's go!

517
00:36:52,786 --> 00:36:54,746
- Way to break up the party!
- Shit!

518
00:36:54,788 --> 00:36:56,748
I should have brought
my drink.

519
00:37:04,214 --> 00:37:06,925
Death by blunt trauma,
and there's a double stabbing.

520
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:09,678
So it's definitely
not suicide.

521
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,721
Okay.
Thank you.

522
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,895
Gale, hi. You're just getting here.
It's not good.

523
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:21,064
It's a single victim:
Sorority girl.

524
00:37:21,147 --> 00:37:24,234
So- I gotta go.
I've got a deadline.

525
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:31,283
- Joel, let's go.
- In-In a minute.

526
00:37:31,324 --> 00:37:33,827
It's happening again,
isn't it?

527
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,829
You'd love that,
wouldn't you?

528
00:37:35,912 --> 00:37:38,874
- Please, stay back.

529
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,335
Better hurry, Gale.
Might get scooped.

530
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:44,337
Come on, I'm just trying
to get close enough...

531
00:37:44,421 --> 00:37:46,715
- to get a shot.
- Move it, Joel.

532
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:52,429
Gale, I have to be honest with you.
I'm not cut out for this.

533
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:56,516
I mean, I was brought here to do
an interview, not Faces of Death 14.

534
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,685
Do not fuck with me.

535
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:13,116
Come on.
Get your jacket.

536
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:15,118
Let's get you home.

537
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,120
Yeah.

538
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,946
- You about ready?

539
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,953
Almost.

540
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:05,168
- Hello?
- Hello, Sidney.

541
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,420
Remember me?

542
00:39:07,504 --> 00:39:12,509
- What do you want?
- I want you. It's show time.

543
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:15,428
Then why don't you show your face,
you fucking coward.

544
00:39:15,512 --> 00:39:17,430
- My pleasure.

545
00:39:17,514 --> 00:39:19,266
Derek!

546
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:23,728
- Sid? Sid?

547
00:39:24,813 --> 00:39:26,565
Derek!

548
00:39:26,648 --> 00:39:29,067
- Sid?

549
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,321
Sid!

550
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

551
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:48,545
- It's me. It's me.

552
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:51,590
- You okay? You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

553
00:39:51,631 --> 00:39:53,717
No, Derek!
Don't!

554
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,760
Sid!

555
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:57,762
Dewey!

556
00:39:57,804 --> 00:39:59,764
- The killer's in there. And Derek.

557
00:40:15,071 --> 00:40:17,866
- You all right?
- He went that way.

558
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:20,076
Sidney, he's in here!

559
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,708
Is everything okay?

560
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:33,298
He got me. He got me.

561
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,762
- Now, apply pressure to it.
- Don't do that-

562
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,393
The police are on their way.

563
00:40:54,903 --> 00:40:57,030
Thanks for your cooperation.

564
00:40:57,113 --> 00:40:59,282
Hallie, I'll be with you
in a few minutes, okay?

565
00:40:59,366 --> 00:41:01,701
Uh, no problem.

566
00:41:01,785 --> 00:41:05,914
That's the easiest interrogation
of my crime-filled life.

567
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:08,959
I'm gonna go get a quick cup of coffee.
You want?

568
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:11,419
No.

569
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,421
You want some, Sid?

570
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:19,177
How you doin'?
You all right?

571
00:41:19,261 --> 00:41:21,179
Not at all.

572
00:41:22,764 --> 00:41:25,183
You know, I knew
this was coming.

573
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:29,604
- I knew this wasn't over.
- You are not alone, Sid.

574
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:32,357
Okay?
We are all here for you.

575
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,526
All right?
Whatever you need.

576
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:39,197
- That poor girl.
- I know.

577
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:41,366
It's crazy, but-

578
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:45,287
- Derek could've been killed, you know.
- But he wasn't.

579
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:50,250
He's fine.
He just needs to realize...

580
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,711
the '90s is no time
to play hero.

581
00:41:52,794 --> 00:41:54,713
Why would anyone go back
in that house anyway?

582
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:02,262
I went around to the back of the house
and ran into Sid there.

583
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:05,390
That's when she told me the killer
was inside, so I went in to see.

584
00:42:05,473 --> 00:42:08,560
- You're lucky there's no nerve damage.

585
00:42:08,643 --> 00:42:11,188
You're gonna have
to take it easy though.

586
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:15,317
- So then you went back inside the house?
- Yeah.

587
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,236
No struggle? He just cut you
and ran away?

588
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,657
- You're lucky he didn't kill you.
- Yeah, it's awfully convenient.

589
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:26,703
- Say what?
- Nothing.

590
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:28,788
It's just a shame
he got away so easily.

591
00:42:28,872 --> 00:42:31,541
It's just a shame
you got there too late,

592
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,835
right after he disappeared.

593
00:42:38,924 --> 00:42:40,759
Yeah, it is.

594
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:02,197
We got three victims.

595
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,825
Maureen Evans,
Phil Stevens...

596
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:08,703
and Cici Cooper.

597
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:12,290
- Is Cici the girl's real name?
- Oh, uh, no.

598
00:43:12,374 --> 00:43:15,210
It's, uh, Casey.
Casey Cooper.

599
00:43:17,754 --> 00:43:20,423
As in Casey Becker?

600
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:24,594
- Excuse me?
- She was a young victim in Woodsboro.

601
00:43:24,678 --> 00:43:28,640
As well as her boyfriend,
Steven Orth.

602
00:43:28,682 --> 00:43:30,767
As in Phil Stevens.

603
00:43:30,851 --> 00:43:34,646
Maureen Evans- Maureen Prescott.
That's Sidney's mother.

604
00:43:34,729 --> 00:43:37,691
Do you think someone's
trying to duplicate Woodsboro?

605
00:43:37,774 --> 00:43:40,151
It looks like it.

606
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:44,990
I think you have a copycat
on your hands, Chief.

607
00:43:45,073 --> 00:43:47,534
Jesus Christ!

608
00:43:47,617 --> 00:43:49,578
What are you doing
to keep Sidney safe?

609
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:52,873
I got my two best
detectives guarding her.

610
00:43:52,956 --> 00:43:56,334
Do these guys have to follow
you around everywhere?

611
00:43:56,418 --> 00:43:58,920
Oh. We're attached
at the hip.

612
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:01,673
- How am I ever gonna get you alone?

613
00:44:01,756 --> 00:44:05,677
- You know, to be honest, Derek,

614
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,139
I think it would probably be
in your best interest to...

615
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:12,017
stay as far away
from me as possible.

616
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:15,854
I hope that was an
off-the-cuff remark...

617
00:44:15,937 --> 00:44:19,191
that holds no
subtext whatsoever.

618
00:44:19,274 --> 00:44:23,195
No, actually.
I mean it.

619
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:30,243
I mean, look at you.
You already got hurt.

620
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:33,121
I don't want to see
that happen again.

621
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:35,123
I'll take my chances.

622
00:44:35,207 --> 00:44:38,168
Derek, I'm serious.

623
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:40,545
This is serious.

624
00:44:42,923 --> 00:44:46,885
You are concerned with my
personal well-being and...

625
00:44:48,595 --> 00:44:53,099
not with trusting me
or anything, right?

626
00:44:57,145 --> 00:44:59,064
Like I said, I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

627
00:44:59,147 --> 00:45:02,734
And I don't want
to see you get hurt.

628
00:45:02,817 --> 00:45:04,736
Okay, Sid?

629
00:45:16,623 --> 00:45:18,792
- Take care, Miss Weathers.
- All right.

630
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:24,130
- Dewey.
- Chief.

631
00:45:25,382 --> 00:45:27,300
Hi.

632
00:45:27,384 --> 00:45:30,846
So, I'm heading over to admissions
to do some leg work. You game?

633
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:33,515
I'm not here to write
a book, Miss Weathers.

634
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:35,517
I'm here to help Sid.

635
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:40,272
I want to help her, too.

636
00:45:40,355 --> 00:45:43,316
And help myself,
of course.

637
00:45:45,318 --> 00:45:49,573
Come on, Dewey. Smile just once.
Please?

638
00:45:51,408 --> 00:45:53,326
I'll smile when
I catch the killer.

639
00:45:56,913 --> 00:45:58,832
Gale, hi. So who
do you think did it?

640
00:45:58,915 --> 00:46:01,334
What about Sidney's father?
Has he been ruled out as a suspect?

641
00:46:01,418 --> 00:46:03,336
Well, he's supposedly out of the country
on business,

642
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,338
but that sounds a little fishy,
don't you think?

643
00:46:05,422 --> 00:46:08,550
- I'm not here to do your job, Miss Salt.
- What about this ex-cop, Dewey?

644
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:10,969
- It's kind of strange that he showed up.
- Yeah, what's he doing here?

645
00:46:11,052 --> 00:46:14,264
Dewey's a good guy,
unlike some of us.

646
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:18,810
Really?

647
00:46:18,852 --> 00:46:21,438
Well, it just seems to me that
if the killer is repeating...

648
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,523
what happened in Woodsboro,
it's quite possible that the killer...

649
00:46:23,607 --> 00:46:25,525
could be from Woodsboro.

650
00:46:25,609 --> 00:46:27,527
That's all.

651
00:46:29,404 --> 00:46:33,450
Derek, you think Sid will let me
interview her for my documentary?

652
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:37,954
Oh, yeah. You know, she turned down
Primetime Live, 20/20 and Dateline.

653
00:46:38,038 --> 00:46:40,582
- But for you, yeah.
- Drop it.

654
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:43,084
I've been thinking about
this whole murder thing.

655
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:45,337
- Have they checked out Randy?
- What?

656
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,632
I know he's an innocent victim the first
time around, but he's a little off.

657
00:46:48,715 --> 00:46:52,469
- You know what I'm saying?
- Come on. Randy? The guy's harmless.

658
00:46:52,511 --> 00:46:55,013
- That's what they said about Dahmer.
- Guys, keep it down.

659
00:46:55,096 --> 00:46:57,140
Come on.
What's up, Sid?

660
00:46:57,224 --> 00:47:00,101
- Hey, Sid.
- How's it goin'?

661
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:02,187
Where are
the Secret Service guys?

662
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,189
Uh, over there.

663
00:47:05,815 --> 00:47:07,776
And which one
is Kevin Costner?

664
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:10,737
The one on the right
is Officer Richards.

665
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,949
He is a Capricorn.
Divorced. Father of two.

666
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:18,578
And the one on the left
is Officer Andrews. He is a Gemini.

667
00:47:18,662 --> 00:47:20,872
He's single,
but I think he's gay.

668
00:47:20,956 --> 00:47:23,416
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

669
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,544
Derek?
Penny for your thoughts.

670
00:47:28,672 --> 00:47:32,676
"This morning, I woke up
with this feeling...

671
00:47:32,759 --> 00:47:35,720
I didn't know
how to deal with."

672
00:47:35,804 --> 00:47:39,432
And so I just
decided to myself

673
00:47:39,516 --> 00:47:42,018
I'd hide it to myself

674
00:47:42,102 --> 00:47:44,062
- What is he doing?

675
00:47:44,104 --> 00:47:47,190
Uh, Tom Cruise,
Top Gun, 1986.

676
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:50,235
- Derek, don't.
- When you walked into the room

677
00:47:50,277 --> 00:47:52,571
- I think I love you
- Don't do this.

678
00:47:52,654 --> 00:47:56,825
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of

679
00:47:56,908 --> 00:48:00,412
And though
it worries me to say

680
00:48:00,495 --> 00:48:03,415
- I've never felt this way, hey

681
00:48:03,456 --> 00:48:07,836
I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of

682
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:11,756
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for

683
00:48:13,633 --> 00:48:16,970
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of

684
00:48:17,053 --> 00:48:19,264
- And though it worries me to say

685
00:48:19,347 --> 00:48:22,434
- I've never felt this way

686
00:48:22,517 --> 00:48:25,937
Believe me
You really don't have to worry

687
00:48:25,979 --> 00:48:28,231
I only wanna
make you happy

688
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:30,483
And if you say
"Hey, go away"

689
00:48:30,567 --> 00:48:33,445
I will
But I think better still

690
00:48:33,528 --> 00:48:35,947
I better stick around
and love you

691
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:39,367
Do you think I have a case
Let me ask you to your face

692
00:48:39,451 --> 00:48:42,621
Do you really love me
'Cause I think

693
00:48:42,704 --> 00:48:46,625
I love you

694
00:48:59,054 --> 00:49:01,890
Let's show
a little love, huh?

695
00:49:08,772 --> 00:49:10,690
Come on.
Come here, come here.

696
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:16,947
Don't worry, Sid.
I know things are a little crazy.

697
00:49:18,657 --> 00:49:21,701
Isn't that a big
frat faux pas?

698
00:49:21,785 --> 00:49:23,745
Oh, yeah.
That is a big no-no.

699
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:26,289
See, you're not supposed to give
your Greek letters to your girl...

700
00:49:26,373 --> 00:49:28,333
no shape, way or form.

701
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:30,335
The brothers are gonna kick his ass,
but it's tradition.

702
00:49:30,377 --> 00:49:33,880
- It's tradition.
- It's good luck.

703
00:49:33,964 --> 00:49:36,007
It'll protect you.

704
00:49:50,647 --> 00:49:53,733
So, tell us about this part
you're getting rave reviews for.

705
00:49:53,817 --> 00:49:56,278
Well, I play this young girl,
Sidney Prescott,

706
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:59,823
who discovers that her boyfriend
is this crazy serial killer...

707
00:49:59,906 --> 00:50:01,950
who also killed her mother
the year before that.

708
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:04,119
So what kind of research
did you do for the part?

709
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:07,330
I don't get it. They get
Tori Spelling to play Sid,

710
00:50:07,414 --> 00:50:09,875
and they cast Joe Blow Nobody
to play me.

711
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:12,669
- At least you get David Schwimmer.

712
00:50:12,752 --> 00:50:14,838
I get the guy who drove
Jane Seymore's stagecoach...

713
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,632
for one episode
of Doctor Quinn.

714
00:50:17,716 --> 00:50:20,927
This is Tori Spelling
starring in the new film Stab.

715
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:29,477
Billy, you scared me.

716
00:50:29,561 --> 00:50:32,647
- What are you doing here?
- They let me go, Sid. I didn't do it.

717
00:50:32,731 --> 00:50:34,983
- I'm innocent.
- I know.

718
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:37,736
- Please.
- Why won't you let me touch you?

719
00:50:39,779 --> 00:50:44,326
Look, I've been going through a lot
lately, Billy. And with my mom-

720
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:48,371
Sid, I think you need
to just deal with that and move on.

721
00:50:48,455 --> 00:50:50,999
I mean, when my mom
left my dad, I accepted it.

722
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:54,669
That's the way
the cookie crumbles. Moms leave.

723
00:50:54,753 --> 00:50:59,382
Yeah, your mom left town. She's not
buried in the cemetery somewhere.

724
00:50:59,466 --> 00:51:02,552
My mom's dead, and she's
never coming back. Ever.

725
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:09,142
- Stupid.
- Ooh, I love scary movies.

726
00:51:09,226 --> 00:51:12,020
I'll wait for video. Okay,
let's get down to business.

727
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:14,147
The way I see it,
someone's out to make a sequel.

728
00:51:14,231 --> 00:51:16,316
You know, cash in on all
the movie murder hoopla.

729
00:51:16,399 --> 00:51:19,194
So it's our job to observe
the rules of the sequel.

730
00:51:19,277 --> 00:51:21,863
Number one: The body count
is always bigger.

731
00:51:21,947 --> 00:51:26,409
Two: The death scenes are always much
more elaborate; more blood, more gore.

732
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:29,371
Carnage candy. Your core audience
just expects it.

733
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:33,458
And three: If you want your sequel
to become a franchise, never ever-

734
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:35,794
How do we find the killer, Randy?
That's what I wanna know.

735
00:51:35,877 --> 00:51:38,421
Oh. Let's look
at the suspects.

736
00:51:38,505 --> 00:51:41,758
There's Derek, the obvious boyfriend.
Hello, Billy Loomis.

737
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,177
The guy's premed, and his
pity-me surface wound...

738
00:51:44,261 --> 00:51:46,972
conveniently missed every major vein
and artery.

739
00:51:47,055 --> 00:51:50,392
- So you think it's Derek?
- Not so fast.

740
00:51:50,475 --> 00:51:52,811
Let's assume the killer,
or 'ers, has a half a brain.

741
00:51:52,894 --> 00:51:55,146
He's not a Nick At Night
rerun type of guy.

742
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:57,148
He wants to break
some new ground.

743
00:51:57,232 --> 00:51:59,401
- Right? So forget the boyfriend.
- Right.

744
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:01,903
- It's tired. Who else do we got?
- There's-

745
00:52:01,987 --> 00:52:04,823
Mickey, the freaky
Tarantino film student.

746
00:52:06,741 --> 00:52:10,203
But if he's a suspect, so am I.
So, let's move on.

747
00:52:10,287 --> 00:52:12,205
Whoa, wait a-
Let's not move on.

748
00:52:12,289 --> 00:52:14,833
Maybe you are a suspect.

749
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:17,627
Well, if I'm a suspect,
you're a suspect.

750
00:52:19,629 --> 00:52:22,716
You have a point.

751
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:25,343
Okay, let's move on to-

752
00:52:25,427 --> 00:52:27,554
- Hallie.
- Sid's roommate?

753
00:52:27,637 --> 00:52:30,682
- Uh-huh. - Serial killers
are typically white males.

754
00:52:30,765 --> 00:52:34,394
That's why it's perfect. It's sort of
against the rules, but not really.

755
00:52:34,477 --> 00:52:37,397
Mrs. Voorhees was
a terrific serial killer.

756
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,733
And there's always room
for Candyman's daughter.

757
00:52:39,816 --> 00:52:42,569
She's sweet. She's deadly.
She's bad for your teeth.

758
00:52:45,697 --> 00:52:48,366
Come on, Randy.
These kids are your friends.

759
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,785
Who do you think's
the killer?

760
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:54,164
- How about Gale Weathers?
- Gale? A killer?

761
00:52:54,247 --> 00:52:58,293
- Why not?
- Well, she is vicious enough.

762
00:52:58,376 --> 00:53:00,754
- She's an opportunist.
- Yeah.

763
00:53:00,837 --> 00:53:03,173
Isn't it conceivable
she's planning her next book?

764
00:53:03,215 --> 00:53:06,760
That's what reporters do, Dewey.
They stage the news.

765
00:53:06,843 --> 00:53:09,763
No. Gale's a lot of things,
but Gale's not a killer.

766
00:53:09,846 --> 00:53:12,599
- Just because you're sweet on her-
- No, I'm not.

767
00:53:12,682 --> 00:53:14,684
Please, this is me talking.
Randy,

768
00:53:14,768 --> 00:53:17,145
the unrequited love-slave
of Sidney Prescott.

769
00:53:17,229 --> 00:53:19,814
I know all
about obsession...

770
00:53:19,898 --> 00:53:21,816
and pain.

771
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,278
- You've got your love scar to prove it.
- And so do you.

772
00:53:25,362 --> 00:53:28,323
And what's with that limp anyway,
'cause you were stabbed in the back.

773
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:31,952
Severed nerve.
Look, Gale's no killer.

774
00:53:33,078 --> 00:53:35,705
Okay, okay.
Whatever you say.

775
00:53:35,747 --> 00:53:38,959
But if she's not a killer,
she's a target.

776
00:53:41,086 --> 00:53:43,129
Joel, let's get
some establishing shots.

777
00:53:43,213 --> 00:53:45,215
Um, Gale,
can we talk for a sec?

778
00:53:45,257 --> 00:53:47,634
- What is it?
- Look, I'm a little confused here.

779
00:53:47,717 --> 00:53:49,761
I mean, with your
given track record,

780
00:53:49,845 --> 00:53:51,972
why would you wanna be here
when the killer strikes again?

781
00:53:52,055 --> 00:53:55,433
I mean, granted, I should've read
your book before I took this job.

782
00:53:55,475 --> 00:53:57,644
But I'm reading it now,
and- Whoo!

783
00:53:57,727 --> 00:53:59,688
I read what happened
to your last cameraman.

784
00:53:59,771 --> 00:54:02,440
The guy got gutted.
Now, me,

785
00:54:02,524 --> 00:54:04,568
I'm gonna do what any
rational human being would do,

786
00:54:04,651 --> 00:54:06,611
which is get the fuck
out of here.

787
00:54:06,653 --> 00:54:08,905
First of all, he wasn't gutted.
I made that up.

788
00:54:08,989 --> 00:54:10,949
His throat was slashed.

789
00:54:10,991 --> 00:54:13,076
What are you-
Gale, gutted, slashed,

790
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:15,120
the guy ain't in
the union no more.

791
00:54:15,161 --> 00:54:17,122
It's a job, Joel.

792
00:54:17,163 --> 00:54:19,416
And like every job,
there's a few drawbacks.

793
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:23,044
But you're a professional cameraman.
You've got to act like one.

794
00:54:23,128 --> 00:54:25,547
Yeah, but I wanna report the news.
I don't wanna be the news.

795
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,383
Besides, brothers don't last long
in situations like this.

796
00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:32,304
This is national television.
Think about it.

797
00:54:32,387 --> 00:54:34,306
This is a big chance
for you.

798
00:54:34,389 --> 00:54:37,184
The story is monumental.
Don't you wanna be a part of that?

799
00:54:38,268 --> 00:54:40,020
Come on.

800
00:54:40,103 --> 00:54:43,565
I need you.
I cannot do this without you.

801
00:54:46,526 --> 00:54:48,486
Good.
Come on.

802
00:54:48,528 --> 00:54:51,865
- Let's get some work done.
- Yeah, let's go get killed.

803
00:54:55,035 --> 00:54:58,830
We've been through this before. You know what
I think about your potential as an actress.

804
00:54:58,997 --> 00:55:00,790
I know.
I know.

805
00:55:00,957 --> 00:55:03,960
It-It's just that with,
um, the murders...

806
00:55:04,002 --> 00:55:07,422
and the movie
and my life-

807
00:55:07,464 --> 00:55:10,217
I do know how difficult
it is for you.

808
00:55:11,885 --> 00:55:14,638
Gus, I-I just-
I don't think I can do it.

809
00:55:14,763 --> 00:55:18,600
The battle for the soul is
fought in the forum of art.

810
00:55:18,683 --> 00:55:22,020
You're a fighter, Sid. That's why you're
here. That's why this is your major.

811
00:55:22,103 --> 00:55:24,439
- Yeah, I'm a fighter.
- I didn't hear that.

812
00:55:26,149 --> 00:55:29,027
- I'm a fighter.
- I don't believe you.

813
00:55:31,571 --> 00:55:33,532
I don't.

814
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:38,036
I'm a fighter.

815
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:40,038
Okay.

816
00:55:42,123 --> 00:55:45,335
So, at the risk of sounding
like a college drama teacher,

817
00:55:45,377 --> 00:55:48,380
if you've got pain around
this kind of material, use it.

818
00:55:48,421 --> 00:55:51,049
This is your role, Sid.

819
00:55:51,132 --> 00:55:54,553
Cassandra is one of the great tragic
visionaries of literature.

820
00:55:54,636 --> 00:55:58,223
She saw it all coming.
The wars,

821
00:55:58,306 --> 00:56:01,393
the murder,
the madness.

822
00:56:03,144 --> 00:56:05,856
She knew
she was cursed.

823
00:56:05,939 --> 00:56:08,984
It was her fate,
and she embraced it.

824
00:56:09,067 --> 00:56:13,822
None of us can avoid our fate,
but as an artist...

825
00:56:13,905 --> 00:56:16,533
you can honestly face it...

826
00:56:16,575 --> 00:56:18,535
and fight it.

827
00:56:22,414 --> 00:56:25,375
- You're good.
- There's no understudy. I'm desperate.

828
00:56:29,671 --> 00:56:31,673
You can do this.

829
00:56:36,928 --> 00:56:40,098
Okay, everybody. Gather around.
Third Act, one last time.

830
00:56:40,182 --> 00:56:43,018
Cue the music.

831
00:56:55,488 --> 00:56:59,701
All behold the dreaded
fate of Troy...

832
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:04,789
that once stood proud and light
upon the hills of Sparta!

833
00:57:04,873 --> 00:57:09,544
Now shrouded in
the deathly smoke of ruin,

834
00:57:09,628 --> 00:57:13,632
her royal children
pitched from her walls,

835
00:57:13,715 --> 00:57:18,470
her people driven
through her ruins.

836
00:57:18,553 --> 00:57:23,975
And now alone in
fate's cruel isolation...

837
00:57:24,017 --> 00:57:26,478
stands Cassandra,

838
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:30,774
her kingdom,
family and friends...

839
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:33,693
driven to the wind.

840
00:57:35,195 --> 00:57:39,950
- No crime against gods or man...

841
00:57:39,991 --> 00:57:41,910
have I committed,

842
00:57:41,993 --> 00:57:45,163
saith to speak
the truth.

843
00:57:45,247 --> 00:57:49,626
And each hideous vision
born from my mind...

844
00:57:49,668 --> 00:57:52,629
has come to pass.

845
00:57:52,671 --> 00:57:55,674
Troy has fallen,

846
00:57:55,715 --> 00:57:59,469
not by my hand
or wish,

847
00:58:00,637 --> 00:58:02,556
but as I foresaw.

848
00:58:06,935 --> 00:58:10,397
So now,
fate's vengeful eye...

849
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,440
is fixed...

850
00:58:14,359 --> 00:58:17,779
on me.

851
00:58:17,863 --> 00:58:21,324
Tell us, O Cassandra,
where has the sweetness...

852
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:23,493
of life gone?

853
00:58:23,535 --> 00:58:27,289
What stays fate's hand
from striking now at thee?

854
00:58:27,372 --> 00:58:29,708
What stays fate's hand
from thee?

855
00:58:29,791 --> 00:58:32,377
What stays fate's hand
from thee?

856
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,379
What stays fate's hand
from thee?

857
00:58:34,462 --> 00:58:37,007
What stays fate's hand
from thee?

858
00:58:57,736 --> 00:59:02,157
All right, hold it.
Hold it!

859
00:59:04,326 --> 00:59:07,162
Everyone, take five.

860
00:59:21,551 --> 00:59:24,429
Sidney?

861
00:59:36,024 --> 00:59:39,778
Sid.
Your escort has arrived.

862
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:42,531
- Derek, how long have you been here?
- I just got here.

863
00:59:42,614 --> 00:59:45,450
- Is everything okay? What's goin' on?
- What happened to Mickey?

864
00:59:45,534 --> 00:59:48,453
We swapped. He had to edit.
You get me instead. What happened?

865
00:59:48,537 --> 00:59:51,414
Derek, don't.

866
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,212
Don't. I-I just need to be alone
right now, okay?

867
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:02,133
Being alone is not
the answer, Sid.

868
01:00:02,217 --> 01:00:06,346
Yeah, well,
I think it is.

869
01:00:06,429 --> 01:00:09,224
I need some distance.

870
01:00:12,811 --> 01:00:14,729
Well, do I
get a say in this?

871
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,150
No.

872
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:28,118
I guess I'm supposed
to be... understanding.

873
01:00:29,411 --> 01:00:32,747
Yeah.

874
01:00:37,669 --> 01:00:39,588
You got it.

875
01:00:47,512 --> 01:00:50,640
All right. Let's just assume the killer
is repeating Woodsboro-

876
01:00:50,724 --> 01:00:52,809
- Yes?

877
01:00:52,851 --> 01:00:55,103
- I have Bob calling.
- I'll have to call you back.

878
01:00:55,187 --> 01:00:57,898
That doesn't
explain Sidney's attack.

879
01:00:57,981 --> 01:01:00,483
Sidney wasn't killed
in Woodsboro.

880
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:02,652
Wasn't for
a lack of trying.

881
01:01:02,736 --> 01:01:05,071
The killer's trying
to finish what was started.

882
01:01:05,155 --> 01:01:07,282
- Sid's under protection, right?
- Yeah.

883
01:01:07,365 --> 01:01:09,618
- What?

884
01:01:09,701 --> 01:01:12,204
- Bob really needs to talk to you-
- Tell Bob I'll call him back.

885
01:01:12,287 --> 01:01:15,707
- When'd she start smoking?
- Ever since those nude pictures on the internet.

886
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:17,959
It was just my head.
It was Jennifer Aniston's body.

887
01:01:18,043 --> 01:01:20,045
Anyway, you're
forgetting something.

888
01:01:20,128 --> 01:01:22,839
In Woodsboro, there were more victims
before the homestretch-

889
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:25,217
Tatum, my cameraman,
Himbry-

890
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:29,721
Time out! I don't need to be hearing
about no dead cameramen, all right?

891
01:01:29,804 --> 01:01:32,474
Now, I'm warning you guys. I am a verb
away from vacatin' these premises.

892
01:01:32,557 --> 01:01:36,186
I'm gonna get me some coffee,
donuts, Prozac,

893
01:01:36,269 --> 01:01:38,772
see if I can find some crack,
Special K- "X," not Malcolm-

894
01:01:38,855 --> 01:01:41,983
and I'll be back when you guys
start talking about something...

895
01:01:42,067 --> 01:01:44,528
a little more Saved By The Bell-ish,
all right?

896
01:01:44,611 --> 01:01:48,323
- He seems a little shaky.
- Don't worry about him.

897
01:01:48,406 --> 01:01:51,326
If the killer is following a pattern,
maybe we can figure out who's next.

898
01:01:51,409 --> 01:01:53,411
I wouldn't follow
a killer's pattern.

899
01:01:53,495 --> 01:01:56,748
We were all involved in Woodsboro.
Could be any one of us.

900
01:01:56,831 --> 01:02:01,211
So what do you wanna do, bonehead? Sit
here and wait and see who drops next?

901
01:02:01,253 --> 01:02:03,797
- Well, I don't know. "Phonehead."

902
01:02:06,258 --> 01:02:09,094
- Gale's not here!

903
01:02:09,177 --> 01:02:11,429
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

904
01:02:11,513 --> 01:02:14,558
You three
look deep in thought.

905
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:17,602
Have you ever felt a knife
cut through human flesh...

906
01:02:17,686 --> 01:02:22,399
- and scrape the bone beneath?
- It's him.

907
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,943
- Who?
- The killer.

908
01:02:24,985 --> 01:02:27,487
He can see us.

909
01:02:33,076 --> 01:02:36,329
- Just keep him on the phone.
- What do you want me to say?

910
01:02:36,413 --> 01:02:40,083
I- I don't know. Just keep him talking.
Come on, Gale.

911
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:42,210
- Uh- Hi.
- What are we doing?

912
01:02:42,294 --> 01:02:44,212
Look for somebody
with a cell phone.

913
01:02:44,296 --> 01:02:47,591
- So what's your favorite scary movie?
- You'll never find me.

914
01:02:47,632 --> 01:02:50,427
What do you care?
Let 'em have their fun.

915
01:02:50,468 --> 01:02:53,805
So, uh-
What's up?

916
01:02:53,889 --> 01:02:56,474
What's your
favorite scary movie?

917
01:02:56,558 --> 01:03:01,438
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening.
What's yours?

918
01:03:01,479 --> 01:03:03,773
- What's your problem?
- Sorry.

919
01:03:03,857 --> 01:03:07,485
Wait. Let me guess.
The House On Sorority Row?

920
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Dorm That Dripped Blood?
Splatter University?
Graduation Day?
Final Exam?
- Am I close?
- Closer than you think.

921
01:03:16,995 --> 01:03:21,333
Too slow, geek.
Do you want to die?

922
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:25,128
Is that the best you can do? Because
Billy and Stu were much more original.

923
01:03:25,212 --> 01:03:27,506
Hey!

924
01:03:27,589 --> 01:03:29,508
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

925
01:03:29,591 --> 01:03:31,635
- Gale Weathers, author of The Woodsboro Murders.
- Who?

926
01:03:31,676 --> 01:03:33,637
Come on.

927
01:03:33,678 --> 01:03:35,847
Okay.

928
01:03:35,931 --> 01:03:38,350
He's gotta be
around here someplace.

929
01:03:38,433 --> 01:03:40,685
He's just playing with us.

930
01:03:42,854 --> 01:03:44,981
White male suspect-
nine o'clock.

931
01:03:45,023 --> 01:03:48,985
- My clock or your clock?
- Your clock.

932
01:03:49,069 --> 01:03:51,279
I'll go
around the back.

933
01:03:52,614 --> 01:03:55,200
Why are you even here,
Randy?

934
01:03:55,283 --> 01:03:58,078
You'll never be
the leading man.

935
01:03:58,161 --> 01:04:00,080
Fuck you!

936
01:04:00,163 --> 01:04:03,625
No matter how hard you try,
you'll never be the hero,

937
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:06,461
and you'll never, ever
get the girl.

938
01:04:06,545 --> 01:04:09,089
- Shit!
- Shit! Sorry.

939
01:04:09,172 --> 01:04:12,968
- Hey, man-
- Wrong guy, dead boy.

940
01:04:13,051 --> 01:04:17,264
Oh, yeah? Well, let's redirect
a moment, Mr. I'm-So-Original.

941
01:04:19,266 --> 01:04:21,726
- What's she doing?
- I don't know.

942
01:04:21,768 --> 01:04:23,728
Hey! Ah!

943
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:25,730
- What just happened?
- What the hell are you doing?

944
01:04:25,772 --> 01:04:29,150
- A citizen's arrest-
- Can I help you?

945
01:04:29,234 --> 01:04:32,529
- Hello? Hello?
- Sorry. Beg your pardon.

946
01:04:32,571 --> 01:04:37,200
Where's your innovation? Why copycat
two high school loser-ass dickheads?

947
01:04:37,242 --> 01:04:39,870
Stu was a pussy-ass
wet rag.

948
01:04:39,953 --> 01:04:43,164
And Billy Loomis- Billy Loomis!
What the fuck!

949
01:04:43,248 --> 01:04:47,878
Jesus! What a rat-lookin',
homo-repressed mama's boy!

950
01:04:47,919 --> 01:04:49,880
Why not set
your goals higher, huh?

951
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You wanna be one
of the big boys? Huh?
Manson, Bundy, O.J.,
Son-

952
01:05:34,132 --> 01:05:37,344
- Where's Randy?
- I don't know. This guy just grabbed me.

953
01:05:37,427 --> 01:05:39,846
- I'm okay, Mom.
- I don't see him.

954
01:05:42,724 --> 01:05:44,684
Randy!

955
01:05:44,768 --> 01:05:46,686
Ah!

956
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:48,688
What's goin' on?

957
01:05:50,398 --> 01:05:52,317
Yo, man.
Who broke my window?

958
01:06:26,685 --> 01:06:29,437
Did your computer
just freeze?

959
01:06:29,521 --> 01:06:32,899
You have an instant message,
that's all. Just hit "alt-M."

960
01:06:32,983 --> 01:06:34,901
Yeah, but I'm
not signed on.

961
01:06:34,985 --> 01:06:38,321
Someone here in the library.
All the terminals are connected.

962
01:06:56,298 --> 01:06:59,342
- He's here.
- Shit.

963
01:06:59,426 --> 01:07:02,137
Get here away from the computer.
Sid, it's probably just a sick joke.

964
01:07:06,099 --> 01:07:08,185
- May I see your screen, please.
- Wait right here.

965
01:07:08,268 --> 01:07:10,228
Yeah.

966
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Psst! Sid, you okay?

967
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:23,158
- Cotton.
- Can we talk for a sec?

968
01:07:23,241 --> 01:07:25,619
Um, this, this isn't
a good time.

969
01:07:25,702 --> 01:07:27,913
Come on, Sid.
You sent me to prison.

970
01:07:27,996 --> 01:07:30,916
I did over a year for you.
You can give me two minutes.

971
01:07:30,999 --> 01:07:34,211
Cotton, I'm sorry. Every day I'm sorry.
I don't know how to apologize anymore.

972
01:07:34,294 --> 01:07:38,048
Sorry-schmarry, Sid. I have the solution
to all of our problems.

973
01:07:38,089 --> 01:07:39,841
What are you
talking about?

974
01:07:39,925 --> 01:07:42,552
First of all,
forget Gale Weathers.

975
01:07:42,594 --> 01:07:45,222
She doesn't get it. She doesn't
see the story. Between you and me,

976
01:07:45,263 --> 01:07:47,849
she wouldn't see the story if
it smacked her in the side of the head.

977
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:50,977
I mean, have you read that book?
Which brings me to my point.

978
01:07:51,061 --> 01:07:53,939
Who calls me out of the blue,
but Diane Sawyer.

979
01:07:54,022 --> 01:07:55,941
Believe me, I was
as shocked as you are.

980
01:07:56,024 --> 01:07:58,527
She tells me that if you and I
go on the air together,

981
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:01,112
- she will give us the entire hour.
- What?

982
01:08:01,196 --> 01:08:05,450
We're talking prime time, Sid.
You, me and Diane Sawyer.

983
01:08:05,534 --> 01:08:07,869
- Cotton, I can't.
- No, no. Look, Sidney.

984
01:08:07,953 --> 01:08:09,996
If this is about money,
it's not like we're not getting paid.

985
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,792
There's $10,000 each, not to mention what
I've got going on the side with the 900 number.

986
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:17,087
- Cotton-
- I know. You don't like the press.

987
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:19,422
I know that,
and I respect it.

988
01:08:19,506 --> 01:08:22,217
But-But, Sidney-

989
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:25,971
It's Diane Sawyer. Hello?

990
01:08:26,054 --> 01:08:31,434
She's a class act. Sidney, this could
be some very, very heavy exposure.

991
01:08:31,476 --> 01:08:34,145
I'm sorry.

992
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:37,649
Look, between the movie
and the book...

993
01:08:37,732 --> 01:08:40,277
people know the truth.

994
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:44,573
Let's get on with our lives. There's been
enough exposure. Why would you want any more?

995
01:08:44,656 --> 01:08:47,409
Why? I don't know,
Sidney. I don't know.

996
01:08:47,492 --> 01:08:50,328
Uh, maybe because I fucking
deserve a little exposure?

997
01:08:50,412 --> 01:08:52,330
I mean, come on, Sidney.
You dragged my name through the mud,

998
01:08:52,414 --> 01:08:54,666
everybody thinks I'm
some kind of psycho killer,

999
01:08:54,749 --> 01:08:58,086
and all I'm asking for is one fucking
Diane Sawyer interview...

1000
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:00,255
to maybe get my side
of the story straight.

1001
01:09:00,338 --> 01:09:03,633
Now, I don't think I'm being
unreasonable in that request.

1002
01:09:03,717 --> 01:09:06,052
Do you?
Honestly?

1003
01:09:07,512 --> 01:09:10,307
I'm... sorry, Cotton,
but no.

1004
01:09:13,101 --> 01:09:15,812
You're sorry.

1005
01:09:15,854 --> 01:09:18,773
Yeah, I bet you're
real sorry, Sidney.

1006
01:09:18,857 --> 01:09:23,195
Such a good angle, Sidney.
Loveable and fucked up Sidney Prescott!

1007
01:09:23,278 --> 01:09:26,489
Everybody's favorite
little victim!

1008
01:09:26,573 --> 01:09:28,533
- Ow! What are you doing?
- Relax!

1009
01:09:28,575 --> 01:09:30,577
- Put your hands on top of your head!
- Shut the fuck up!

1010
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:35,332
Jesus! I'm not Billy Loomis!
You killed him! He's dead! Remember?

1011
01:09:35,415 --> 01:09:38,168
Run it by me one more time,
will ya?

1012
01:09:38,251 --> 01:09:42,297
- Why did you attack Sidney Prescott?
- I didn't- There was no attack.

1013
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,508
We were talking
very heatedly.

1014
01:09:44,549 --> 01:09:46,551
Miss Prescott and I...

1015
01:09:46,635 --> 01:09:50,055
have a very
complicated past.

1016
01:09:50,096 --> 01:09:52,182
I didn't think
that was a crime.

1017
01:09:52,224 --> 01:09:56,353
- No, but homicide is.
- Okay then, book me. Book me.

1018
01:09:56,394 --> 01:09:58,647
Okay? Look.

1019
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,899
I don't know about homicide,
but you've definitely...

1020
01:10:00,982 --> 01:10:04,361
got me for raising my voice
in a public library.

1021
01:10:04,402 --> 01:10:08,823
We're dealing with four murders
here. You watch your mouth.

1022
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:14,454
That shouldn't have been Randy.

1023
01:10:14,538 --> 01:10:17,749
- It should have been me.
- No.

1024
01:10:17,832 --> 01:10:20,210
I should call his mother.

1025
01:10:20,293 --> 01:10:23,088
Sid, I already made
that phone call.

1026
01:10:27,801 --> 01:10:29,803
Are you okay?

1027
01:10:29,886 --> 01:10:32,889
Stop treating me like glass,
Dewey, I'm not gonna break.

1028
01:10:32,973 --> 01:10:36,017
It's okay to break.

1029
01:10:36,101 --> 01:10:38,019
It's not gonna happen.

1030
01:10:38,103 --> 01:10:40,730
You better hope
your alibi's airtight.

1031
01:10:40,814 --> 01:10:44,568
Could I please remind everyone here
that I'm an innocent man.

1032
01:10:44,609 --> 01:10:48,738
Don't you watch TV? Current Edition?
That was a very insightful program...

1033
01:10:48,822 --> 01:10:52,492
on which it was made abundantly clear
that I'm an innocent man.

1034
01:10:52,576 --> 01:10:56,246
So until you find me standing over
a dead body with a knife in my hand,

1035
01:10:56,329 --> 01:10:58,498
I think you better treat me
with the rights and privileges...

1036
01:10:58,582 --> 01:11:01,793
accorded to every innocent citizen
in this country.

1037
01:11:06,047 --> 01:11:09,676
I don't- Is there- Is there
some problem with the word "innocent"?

1038
01:11:09,759 --> 01:11:11,803
I know. It's a big one.
Chief?

1039
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:25,609
- What's going on?
- I have to let him go.

1040
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,861
- Why?
- We don't have anything on him.

1041
01:11:32,574 --> 01:11:34,743
Sign here.

1042
01:11:38,663 --> 01:11:42,501
Gale.
Enjoying the show?

1043
01:11:42,584 --> 01:11:44,669
- Cops are funny.
- What do you think you're doing?

1044
01:11:44,753 --> 01:11:47,380
Waiting for
my 15 minutes of fame.

1045
01:11:47,464 --> 01:11:50,175
You can understand that,
can't you, Gale?

1046
01:11:52,177 --> 01:11:54,513
Don't do anything stupid,
Cotton.

1047
01:11:54,596 --> 01:11:59,100
Gale, you were so
instrumental in my freedom.

1048
01:11:59,184 --> 01:12:02,229
You're not having
character doubts now, are you?

1049
01:12:08,068 --> 01:12:11,154
- Sidney, if you change your mind-
- Come on. Take a hike.

1050
01:12:13,698 --> 01:12:15,659
Sorry about that.

1051
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,994
What a creep.

1052
01:12:18,036 --> 01:12:20,038
They're gonna take you
somewhere safe, Sid.

1053
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,791
Yeah?
Where's that.

1054
01:12:22,874 --> 01:12:25,836
I don't know, but I'll
be there with you.

1055
01:12:29,214 --> 01:12:31,633
We should get going.

1056
01:12:31,716 --> 01:12:34,511
We'll take you by the dorm,
and you can pack some things.

1057
01:12:34,553 --> 01:12:37,305
We've issued
a campus lock-in this evening.

1058
01:12:37,389 --> 01:12:41,184
- No one's allowed out after dark, okay?
- Yeah.

1059
01:12:41,268 --> 01:12:43,854
Who's doing this, Dewey?
I mean,

1060
01:12:43,895 --> 01:12:46,439
if not Cotton,
then who?

1061
01:12:46,523 --> 01:12:48,859
I don't know, Sid,
but I'll find him.

1062
01:12:54,698 --> 01:12:58,076
Any leads, Gale? Do you think
the killer will come after you?

1063
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,203
How does it feel to be
on the other side of the news?

1064
01:13:00,287 --> 01:13:02,330
There's Cotton.
Cotton! Hey!

1065
01:13:02,414 --> 01:13:05,000
- Are you still a suspect?
- It's all been a huge misunderstanding.

1066
01:13:05,083 --> 01:13:07,002
- Have you been officially released?
- Gale! Hang on one second.

1067
01:13:07,085 --> 01:13:10,422
How about a photo?
No? You look great.

1068
01:13:10,505 --> 01:13:12,424
How're you
holding up, Gale?

1069
01:13:12,507 --> 01:13:16,052
Must be scary knowing somebody's out
there waiting, watching, enjoying all this.

1070
01:13:16,136 --> 01:13:18,096
- How does that make you feel?
- Look, local woman!

1071
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:20,765
I know that you hold me up
as your career template...

1072
01:13:20,849 --> 01:13:24,853
and it gives you some sort of...
charge to challenge me.

1073
01:13:24,936 --> 01:13:27,397
But give it a rest!

1074
01:13:28,815 --> 01:13:30,817
You're right. I'm sorry.
It's my-

1075
01:13:30,901 --> 01:13:32,819
It was the wrong time.
I'm sorry.

1076
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,995
- What's going on?
- Whoo, let's see. For starters, they impounded my van.

1077
01:13:42,078 --> 01:13:44,831
It's now an official
crime scene, thanks to you.

1078
01:13:44,915 --> 01:13:47,375
Here's your footage.
Enjoy.

1079
01:13:47,459 --> 01:13:49,419
See ya.
Wouldn't wanna be ya.

1080
01:13:49,461 --> 01:13:51,421
Joel, I need you!

1081
01:13:51,463 --> 01:13:55,091
No. No, you need to
have your head examined.

1082
01:14:08,146 --> 01:14:11,900
- I feel bad, Dewey.

1083
01:14:11,983 --> 01:14:13,902
I feel really bad.

1084
01:14:15,529 --> 01:14:17,489
I never say that
because...

1085
01:14:17,531 --> 01:14:20,283
I never feel bad
about anything.

1086
01:14:20,367 --> 01:14:23,161
But I feel bad now.

1087
01:14:26,873 --> 01:14:30,126
Is this
just another...

1088
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:33,088
brilliant Gale Weathers
performance?

1089
01:14:33,171 --> 01:14:36,466
There are no cameras here.
I just wanna find this fucker!

1090
01:14:38,927 --> 01:14:43,139
I- I really do.

1091
01:14:45,642 --> 01:14:47,894
Me too.

1092
01:14:57,821 --> 01:14:59,739
Could I
give you a hand?

1093
01:15:03,952 --> 01:15:06,663
What's in here?

1094
01:15:06,746 --> 01:15:09,457
Just some crowd footage
that Joel shot.

1095
01:15:12,794 --> 01:15:15,213
Hey, wait a minute.

1096
01:15:19,134 --> 01:15:22,804
If the killer really is
watching and relishing every minute,

1097
01:15:22,888 --> 01:15:25,182
then he'd be here
on these tapes, right?

1098
01:15:25,223 --> 01:15:28,226
- At each crime scene.
- It's worth a look.

1099
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:34,441
It's definitely
worth a look.

1100
01:15:52,209 --> 01:15:54,127
This way.

1101
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:58,673
Dubbing room.
Editorial.

1102
01:15:58,757 --> 01:16:00,717
Video archive.

1103
01:16:05,347 --> 01:16:07,557
- It's locked.
- Can you pick it?

1104
01:16:07,641 --> 01:16:11,061
- That would be breaking and entering.
- No shit.

1105
01:16:11,102 --> 01:16:13,647
There's gotta be a VCR
around here somewhere.

1106
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:15,649
What's in there?

1107
01:16:17,776 --> 01:16:20,278
- Now we're gettin' somewhere.
- Perfect!

1108
01:16:35,126 --> 01:16:37,420
- Let's start with this one.

1109
01:16:37,504 --> 01:16:40,715
- Sorry. Oh!
- Oh!

1110
01:16:40,799 --> 01:16:43,260
- Ow.
- I'm sorry.

1111
01:16:43,301 --> 01:16:46,054
- Did I hurt you?
- No.

1112
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:13,081
You're a money-hungry,
fame-seeking-

1113
01:17:13,165 --> 01:17:17,085
forgive me for saying-
mediocre writer...

1114
01:17:17,169 --> 01:17:20,589
who's got a cold storage shed
where her heart should be.

1115
01:17:20,672 --> 01:17:23,175
- I didn't mean to imply-
- Listen.

1116
01:17:23,258 --> 01:17:27,929
- You're cute when you're angry.
- I was rude.

1117
01:17:28,013 --> 01:17:30,348
I was being rude.

1118
01:17:34,019 --> 01:17:36,813
Dewey, I'm sorry.

1119
01:17:36,897 --> 01:17:41,109
I never meant
to hurt you. Hey.

1120
01:17:43,195 --> 01:17:46,448
Really.

1121
01:18:07,302 --> 01:18:09,888
I should be studying.
You know I got a Bio-

1122
01:18:09,971 --> 01:18:12,474
Dewey.

1123
01:18:12,557 --> 01:18:14,976
Dewey!

1124
01:18:16,645 --> 01:18:20,190
- Sorry.
- That's not my footage.

1125
01:18:20,232 --> 01:18:21,816
Outside.

1126
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:30,033
- Fuck you!
- No matter how hard you try, you'll never be the hero,

1127
01:18:30,075 --> 01:18:32,953
and you'll never, ever
get the girl.

1128
01:18:34,037 --> 01:18:35,956
- Sorry.
- Wrong guy, dead boy.

1129
01:18:41,127 --> 01:18:44,256
- Stay here.
- Dewey, don't!

1130
01:19:01,106 --> 01:19:03,108
Dewey!

1131
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
There's no one there.

1132
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1133
01:21:07,232 --> 01:21:09,150
Fuck!

1134
01:21:30,088 --> 01:21:32,173
Gale!

1135
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:34,259
Gale?

1136
01:21:52,527 --> 01:21:54,613
Gale!

1137
01:22:41,826 --> 01:22:43,745
No!

1138
01:23:28,589 --> 01:23:32,552
So.

1139
01:23:32,593 --> 01:23:34,929
Listen, Sid.

1140
01:23:36,514 --> 01:23:38,766
Hey, wait up!

1141
01:23:38,808 --> 01:23:41,519
- She's- She's fine.
- I'm her therapist.

1142
01:23:43,604 --> 01:23:45,565
Bye, Derek.

1143
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:47,859
Bye.

1144
01:23:47,942 --> 01:23:49,944
We better get going.

1145
01:23:54,782 --> 01:23:57,368
When this is all over,

1146
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:00,788
I'll still be here.

1147
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:39,243
You! Prepare to die.

1148
01:24:40,828 --> 01:24:43,581
- You gave up your letters.
- Oh, man.

1149
01:24:45,333 --> 01:24:48,002
I'm not-
Uh, guys-

1150
01:24:48,086 --> 01:24:50,838
- To Troy! We march!
- Whoo!

1151
01:24:53,341 --> 01:24:55,426
This is so romantic.

1152
01:24:55,468 --> 01:24:57,595
- And so Greek!

1153
01:25:03,434 --> 01:25:08,106
I was in the wrong place
But it must have been the right time

1154
01:25:08,189 --> 01:25:12,276
I was in the right place
But it must have been the wrong song

1155
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:17,115
I was in the right vein
But it seemed like the wrong arm

1156
01:25:17,198 --> 01:25:20,993
I was in the right world
But it seemed like wrong, wrong, wrong

1157
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:24,789
- Wrong song
- Who do you love, baby?

1158
01:25:24,872 --> 01:25:28,793
- Sidney.
- Did you say

1159
01:25:28,835 --> 01:25:31,045
No, I said Sidney!

1160
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:55,386
So, where are you
taking us, anyway?

1161
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
If we tell you,
we'll have to kill you.
Don't ask; don't tell.

1162
01:26:32,089 --> 01:26:33,841
Help me!

1163
01:26:35,009 --> 01:26:37,761
Oh, my God!

1164
01:26:38,355 --> 01:26:40,774
Outta the car,
you fucker!

1165
01:26:48,031 --> 01:26:50,951
Get down back there!
Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!

1166
01:26:50,992 --> 01:26:52,953
I'll blow your
fuckin' head-

1167
01:27:32,242 --> 01:27:36,746
- Is he dead?
- I don't think so.

1168
01:27:38,707 --> 01:27:41,793
- He's still breathing.
- Oh!

1169
01:27:45,422 --> 01:27:47,465
Oh, is he dead?

1170
01:27:47,507 --> 01:27:50,260
Oh, God.
I think so.

1171
01:27:57,267 --> 01:28:01,354
- How are you
supposed to get outta here?

1172
01:28:09,946 --> 01:28:13,950
Hallie, it's the only way out.
Help me out.

1173
01:28:17,537 --> 01:28:19,456
Come on.

1174
01:28:46,316 --> 01:28:49,069
We're jammed up against
a pole.

1175
01:28:52,113 --> 01:28:53,990
Oh, my God.

1176
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh. Oh, my God.
Come on, Sid.
Don't! Sid!

1177
01:29:21,017 --> 01:29:23,770
God, I hate this shit.

1178
01:29:26,189 --> 01:29:30,026
Oh, my God.
Don't do that again.

1179
01:29:41,538 --> 01:29:43,623
Try the window.

1180
01:29:58,388 --> 01:30:00,307
- Shit!
- Get me the fuck outta here, Sid.

1181
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:03,893
I can't. The door's jammed.
You have to go through the front.

1182
01:30:03,977 --> 01:30:05,979
- Oh, no fuckin' way.
- Hallie, do it.

1183
01:30:06,062 --> 01:30:09,816
Go on.
Hallie, go.

1184
01:30:17,907 --> 01:30:19,826
Okay.

1185
01:30:19,909 --> 01:30:23,663
Okay, that's right.
Shh.

1186
01:30:24,998 --> 01:30:28,084
Okay.
Okay, that's good.

1187
01:30:31,004 --> 01:30:33,506
Oh, right
through his eye.

1188
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:35,592
Come on.

1189
01:30:35,675 --> 01:30:37,677
That's good. Easy. Easy.

1190
01:30:37,761 --> 01:30:40,430
He's not gonna hurt you.

1191
01:30:50,774 --> 01:30:53,068
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

1192
01:30:55,862 --> 01:30:59,616
- Hallie.
- What?

1193
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:01,785
I wanna know
who it is.

1194
01:31:01,868 --> 01:31:04,037
- Oh, no. Come on, Sid.
Please? Let's just go.

1195
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:06,539
Look, look.
Stupid people go back.

1196
01:31:06,623 --> 01:31:09,793
Smart people run. We're smart people, so
we should just get the fuck outta here.

1197
01:31:09,876 --> 01:31:12,212
Hallie, I'm sick
of running.

1198
01:31:12,462 --> 01:31:15,381
- If we know who it is, then it's over.
- No, we can just get the police.

1199
01:31:15,464 --> 01:31:18,550
And when we come back, he'll be gone.
It'll only take a minute.

1200
01:31:18,633 --> 01:31:22,969
- I have to do this.
- Sid. No, Sid. Come back!

1201
01:31:23,052 --> 01:31:27,055
Sid, come back.
Shit.

1202
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Oh, shit.
- What?
- He's gone!
- What?

1203
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:47,985
- No!

1204
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1205
01:32:14,232 --> 01:32:15,108
- Gale.

1206
01:32:17,194 --> 01:32:18,000
Get away from me.

1207
01:32:18,001 --> 01:32:20,673
This isn't what it looks like.

1208
01:32:20,756 --> 01:32:24,341
I found Dewey. I tried to help him.
I- No, no. Gale, wait.

1209
01:32:24,425 --> 01:32:26,594
Gale! Gale, wait!
Gale!

1210
01:32:29,289 --> 01:32:30,165
Shit.

1211
01:32:36,433 --> 01:32:38,054
- You can't miss the street-
- Help me!

1212
01:32:38,089 --> 01:32:41,603
...curfew in full effect.
- Give me the goddamn phone!

1213
01:32:41,686 --> 01:32:45,604
- Gale. I was right
in the middle of a story.

1214
01:32:45,639 --> 01:32:48,691
- What's the matter?
- Operator, this is an emergency!

1215
01:32:48,726 --> 01:32:50,936
- What's happening?
- The killer!

1216
01:32:51,436 --> 01:32:53,021
Cotton Weary?

1217
01:33:41,736 --> 01:33:42,612
Hello?

1218
01:33:47,075 --> 01:33:47,951
Gus?

1219
01:33:53,748 --> 01:33:54,583
Hello?

1220
01:34:00,881 --> 01:34:01,840
Hello?

1221
01:34:13,143 --> 01:34:14,060
Hello?

1222
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1223
01:35:12,294 --> 01:35:14,297
Derek?

1224
01:35:14,379 --> 01:35:17,718
Derek!
Oh, God.

1225
01:35:17,801 --> 01:35:21,638
Thank you. Thank God, Sid. Thought I was
gonna be up there till opening night.

1226
01:35:21,722 --> 01:35:24,558
- Shit! Who tied these?
We gotta get outta here.

1227
01:35:24,641 --> 01:35:28,481
- He's out there. He killed Hallie.
- What are you talking about?

1228
01:35:28,564 --> 01:35:31,151
- The killer! He's here.
- Where?

1229
01:35:31,233 --> 01:35:34,487
Right here.

1230
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:37,406
- You're fast, Sid.
- Get me down. Hurry!

1231
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:41,997
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You really wanna trust your boyfriend?

1232
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:45,833
Don't you know history repeats itself?

1233
01:35:45,917 --> 01:35:47,836
Hmm, Sid?

1234
01:35:55,094 --> 01:35:57,597
Mickey.

1235
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:00,936
Surprise, Sidney.

1236
01:36:01,019 --> 01:36:05,774
- What the fuck?
- Since Derek, here,

1237
01:36:05,857 --> 01:36:09,361
I been on my own
all fuckin' night.

1238
01:36:09,444 --> 01:36:12,115
- Thanks a lot, partner.
- You motherfucker!

1239
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:14,701
Sid, he's crazy.
You know me better than that.

1240
01:36:14,785 --> 01:36:19,373
Come on, Sid.
I gotta have a partner.

1241
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:22,211
I couldn't have possibly
done this alone.

1242
01:36:22,294 --> 01:36:24,630
- God, Derek.
- Sid.

1243
01:36:24,713 --> 01:36:28,217
Oh, no, Sid. Sid.
No, no, no, no.

1244
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:30,803
It's okay, Derek.
We got her.

1245
01:36:30,888 --> 01:36:33,307
You-
Sid, he's lying!

1246
01:36:33,391 --> 01:36:36,727
Sid! Sid!
Untie me.

1247
01:36:36,811 --> 01:36:39,564
- Sid, untie me.
- Hmm?

1248
01:36:39,647 --> 01:36:41,568
Boyfriend. Killer.
Boyfriend. Killer.

1249
01:36:41,651 --> 01:36:44,821
Sid, the man is lying!
Untie me. Sid.

1250
01:36:44,904 --> 01:36:47,824
Untie me.
Untie me.

1251
01:36:47,907 --> 01:36:51,913
What do you think, Derek?
Sidney experiencing some deja vu?

1252
01:36:51,998 --> 01:36:55,084
No. No. I am gonna
fuckin' kill you!

1253
01:36:55,168 --> 01:36:58,587
Fuckin' kill you!
You are dead! Dead!

1254
01:36:58,670 --> 01:37:01,673
- Derek.

1255
01:37:01,756 --> 01:37:03,927
- Sid. - Derek.

1256
01:37:08,515 --> 01:37:10,434
I'm sorry.

1257
01:37:11,853 --> 01:37:14,608
I never...

1258
01:37:14,691 --> 01:37:18,110
would've...
hurt you.

1259
01:37:18,194 --> 01:37:20,530
Never.

1260
01:37:32,627 --> 01:37:35,381
You should really deal with
your trust issues, Sid.

1261
01:37:35,465 --> 01:37:39,135
I mean, poor Derek. He's completely
innocent. And such a nice boy too.

1262
01:37:39,219 --> 01:37:43,473
He's bright and funny and
handsome. Decent singing voice.

1263
01:37:43,556 --> 01:37:46,811
This was just the kind of boy
you'd like to take home to Mom.

1264
01:37:46,895 --> 01:37:49,314
- If you had a mom.
- Fuck you!

1265
01:37:49,397 --> 01:37:52,400
Oh! So vulgar. Did Billy
let you talk to him this way?

1266
01:37:52,484 --> 01:37:55,155
Billy was a sick fuck,
just like you.

1267
01:37:55,239 --> 01:37:58,075
No. Billy was a sick fuck
who tried to get away with it.

1268
01:37:58,158 --> 01:38:00,911
Mickey is a sick fuck
who wants to get caught. Yeah!

1269
01:38:00,994 --> 01:38:04,331
See, I've got my whole defense
planned out.

1270
01:38:04,414 --> 01:38:07,002
I'm gonna blame
the movies.

1271
01:38:07,086 --> 01:38:09,755
Pretty cool, huh?
It hasn't been done before.

1272
01:38:09,839 --> 01:38:13,343
You see, this is just the beginning,
a prelude to the trial.

1273
01:38:13,426 --> 01:38:16,848
That's where the real fun is 'cause
these days it's all about the trial.

1274
01:38:16,931 --> 01:38:20,351
Can't you see it? The effects
of cinema violence on society.

1275
01:38:20,434 --> 01:38:23,187
I'll get Dershovitz
or Cochran to represent me.

1276
01:38:23,271 --> 01:38:25,606
Bob Dole on the witness stand
in my defense.

1277
01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:28,027
Hell, the Christian Coalition'll
pay my legal fees.

1278
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:31,364
It's airtight, Sid.

1279
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:34,200
I'm an innocent victim.

1280
01:38:34,284 --> 01:38:37,372
- You're a psychotic.
- Yeah, well. Shh.

1281
01:38:37,455 --> 01:38:39,374
That'll be our little secret.

1282
01:38:39,457 --> 01:38:43,545
'Cause people love a good trial.
It's like theater. They're dyin' for it.

1283
01:38:43,628 --> 01:38:47,051
And I've worked hard
to give the audience what they want.

1284
01:38:47,135 --> 01:38:50,637
That's what Billy was good at.
He knew... it's all about...

1285
01:38:50,672 --> 01:38:52,472
- execution.
- Yeah?

1286
01:38:52,556 --> 01:38:56,560
Well, you're forgetting
one thing about Billy Loomis.

1287
01:38:56,643 --> 01:38:59,315
What's that?

1288
01:38:59,398 --> 01:39:01,318
I fucking killed him.

1289
01:39:01,401 --> 01:39:03,819
You piece of shit!

1290
01:39:29,684 --> 01:39:31,603
Sid.

1291
01:39:33,522 --> 01:39:36,107
You got a Linda Hamilton
thing going.

1292
01:39:36,191 --> 01:39:39,110
No, no. It's nice.
I like it.

1293
01:39:39,194 --> 01:39:42,699
Now, who's doin' that?

1294
01:39:42,783 --> 01:39:47,204
Could that be... the mystery guest
waiting in the wings?

1295
01:39:47,287 --> 01:39:49,875
Told ya I had a partner.

1296
01:39:49,959 --> 01:39:51,962
Surprise cameo
just for you.

1297
01:39:56,382 --> 01:39:58,801
Gale.

1298
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:11,569
Mrs. Loomis?

1299
01:40:11,652 --> 01:40:15,989
- What?
- Billy's mother!

1300
01:40:16,072 --> 01:40:19,492
Nice twist, huh?
Didn't see it comin', did ya?

1301
01:40:20,493 --> 01:40:22,463
Jesus.

1302
01:40:22,498 --> 01:40:25,501
It can't be. I've-
I've seen pictures of you.

1303
01:40:25,585 --> 01:40:27,836
This is 60 pounds
and a lot of work later.

1304
01:40:27,919 --> 01:40:30,672
It's called a make-over.
You should try it.

1305
01:40:30,755 --> 01:40:34,177
Look a little tired
yourself there, Gale.

1306
01:40:34,261 --> 01:40:37,180
- So you two are in this together?
- Yeah, well.

1307
01:40:37,264 --> 01:40:42,019
Had to have financing.
Tuition's expensive.

1308
01:40:42,105 --> 01:40:46,859
Deb, there- my backer. We met on the
Internet. Psycho Web site. Classifieds.

1309
01:40:46,942 --> 01:40:51,280
There's only an estimated
97 active serial killers in the country.

1310
01:40:51,363 --> 01:40:55,036
So Mickey, here, was quite a find.
Definitely one on the way up.

1311
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:59,041
- All he needed was a little
guidance and nurturing.

1312
01:40:59,124 --> 01:41:01,877
Told you it was gonna work.
Wait till the trial!

1313
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,880
It is gonna rock!

1314
01:41:03,963 --> 01:41:07,384
Oh, Mickey.
There's not gonna be a trial.

1315
01:41:14,309 --> 01:41:16,561
- Gale!

1316
01:41:29,576 --> 01:41:31,411
Two birds, one stone.

1317
01:41:33,247 --> 01:41:37,586
Oh, Mickey was a good boy, but, my God,
that whole blame the movies motive.

1318
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:39,755
Did you buy that
for one second?

1319
01:41:39,838 --> 01:41:42,925
Poor boy was completely
out of his mind.

1320
01:41:43,008 --> 01:41:46,347
- And you're not?
- No. I'm very sane.

1321
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:49,934
My motive isn't
as '90s as Mickey's.

1322
01:41:50,017 --> 01:41:53,354
Mine is just
good old fashioned revenge.

1323
01:41:53,437 --> 01:41:56,276
You killed my son!

1324
01:41:56,359 --> 01:42:00,113
And now I kill you. And I can't think
of anything more rational.

1325
01:42:00,196 --> 01:42:02,949
You're never gonna
get away with this.

1326
01:42:03,032 --> 01:42:05,368
Of course I will.

1327
01:42:05,451 --> 01:42:07,706
Everything's traceable
back to Mickey.

1328
01:42:07,789 --> 01:42:10,792
Including the cop gun he used
to kill everybody.

1329
01:42:10,876 --> 01:42:12,961
But let's just suppose
that you...

1330
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:15,630
had gotten hold
of the other cop's gun.

1331
01:42:15,714 --> 01:42:19,136
And you chased Mickey. And there was
a big shoot-out and a big scuffle.

1332
01:42:19,219 --> 01:42:23,141
And you shot Mickey,
killed Mickey dead.

1333
01:42:24,975 --> 01:42:29,481
But not before he got off
one shot at you.

1334
01:42:29,565 --> 01:42:33,152
Okay. So, have I
covered everything?

1335
01:42:33,235 --> 01:42:35,821
Are there any questions, any comments?
You know what, though?

1336
01:42:35,905 --> 01:42:38,826
Who give a flyin' fuck
anyway?

1337
01:42:38,910 --> 01:42:43,664
Let 'em try and track down
the second possible killer.

1338
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:47,001
You're as crazy
as your son was.

1339
01:42:47,084 --> 01:42:50,340
What did you just say?

1340
01:42:50,423 --> 01:42:55,178
Was that a negative, disparaging
remark about my son? About my Billy?

1341
01:42:55,261 --> 01:42:57,347
No, Billy was a good boy.

1342
01:42:57,430 --> 01:42:59,852
Billy was perfect.
You did a bang up job, Mrs. Loomis.

1343
01:42:59,936 --> 01:43:03,104
It's not wise to patronize
a woman with a gun, Sidney.

1344
01:43:03,188 --> 01:43:06,858
Randy spoke poorly of Billy,
and I got a little knife happy.

1345
01:43:06,942 --> 01:43:09,363
I was a good mother.

1346
01:43:09,446 --> 01:43:13,116
You know what
makes me sick?

1347
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,953
I'm sick to death of people saying
that it's all the parent's fault.

1348
01:43:16,036 --> 01:43:18,622
That it all starts with the family.
You wanna blame someone?

1349
01:43:18,705 --> 01:43:20,793
Why don't you blame
your mother?

1350
01:43:20,876 --> 01:43:24,380
She's the one who stole my husband
and broke up my family.

1351
01:43:24,463 --> 01:43:28,050
And then you took my son!

1352
01:43:29,637 --> 01:43:32,557
You don't know what it is
to be a mother.

1353
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:37,061
To raise a child and teach him...
and guide him-

1354
01:43:37,144 --> 01:43:39,695
And abandon him.

1355
01:43:39,730 --> 01:43:41,986
Isn't Mickey
supposed to be dead?

1356
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1357
01:46:20,173 --> 01:46:22,675
Don't you fuckin' move!

1358
01:46:22,759 --> 01:46:25,511
- Goddammit!
- Cotton.

1359
01:46:25,595 --> 01:46:28,934
Okay, okay, okay.
Everybody slow down.

1360
01:46:29,017 --> 01:46:32,437
I have had
a very, very bad day,

1361
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:37,108
and I would like to know exactly
what the fuck is going on here?

1362
01:46:37,192 --> 01:46:39,780
- Sidney?
- Cotton, meet Billy Loomis' mother.

1363
01:46:39,863 --> 01:46:41,782
She's the killer.

1364
01:46:41,865 --> 01:46:43,784
What?

1365
01:46:46,955 --> 01:46:49,375
- Then who's that?
- The other killer.

1366
01:46:49,458 --> 01:46:53,796
- Mickey.
- Okay.

1367
01:46:53,879 --> 01:46:56,382
- Look, Cotton-
- Shut up.

1368
01:46:56,465 --> 01:46:59,470
So. Hi.

1369
01:47:01,139 --> 01:47:03,809
You're, uh,
not Debbie Salt, are you?

1370
01:47:03,892 --> 01:47:06,645
You're not with
the Post Telegraph.

1371
01:47:06,728 --> 01:47:09,483
No, but I can still
help you, Cotton.

1372
01:47:09,566 --> 01:47:11,901
Ah-ah-ah!

1373
01:47:11,985 --> 01:47:14,118
You don't need her.
Let me kill her!

1374
01:47:14,153 --> 01:47:18,324
As long as she's alive,
you're never gonna be the lead story.

1375
01:47:18,359 --> 01:47:20,663
That's what you really want,
isn't it, Cotton?

1376
01:47:20,746 --> 01:47:23,081
If you really wanna be
in the spotlight,

1377
01:47:23,164 --> 01:47:26,501
just let me kill her...
right now.

1378
01:47:26,584 --> 01:47:29,921
Then you're the only survivor.
You're the star!

1379
01:47:32,342 --> 01:47:36,144
She sent you to prison
for a year!

1380
01:47:36,179 --> 01:47:39,516
Personally, I think
it's rather poetic.

1381
01:47:46,609 --> 01:47:50,362
No. No, Cotton,
don't you listen to her.

1382
01:47:50,446 --> 01:47:53,284
Well- Well-

1383
01:47:53,367 --> 01:47:55,870
It's, uh, quite a predicament
you're in, Sid.

1384
01:47:55,953 --> 01:47:59,540
- Cotton-
- I mean, she makes a good point.

1385
01:47:59,624 --> 01:48:01,709
Let me think about this.

1386
01:48:01,794 --> 01:48:03,880
Maybe you should too.

1387
01:48:03,963 --> 01:48:07,133
Betcha that Diane Sawyer interview's
lookin' real good right about now.

1388
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:13,391
Huh?

1389
01:48:23,570 --> 01:48:25,906
Consider it done.

1390
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:48,099
Wow.

1391
01:48:48,182 --> 01:48:51,102
That... was intense.

1392
01:49:03,116 --> 01:49:05,120
Hey, Sidney, uh-

1393
01:49:05,203 --> 01:49:09,124
Look, I want you to know that I would
never, ever do anything to hurt you.

1394
01:49:09,159 --> 01:49:12,043
Cotton, give me the gun.

1395
01:49:15,132 --> 01:49:19,219
Yeah. Okay. Sure.
Take it.

1396
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Hey, Sid, we should talk about
exactly what happened here.
You know- I mean, get our stories
straight for the press statement.
- Oh, shit!

1397
01:49:28,397 --> 01:49:31,483
- Cotton.
- Could somebody get me outta here?

1398
01:49:31,567 --> 01:49:33,986
Gale!
Are you all right?

1399
01:49:34,069 --> 01:49:35,990
I been shot.
Of course not.

1400
01:49:36,073 --> 01:49:38,624
- Help!
- Give me your hand, Gale.

1401
01:49:38,659 --> 01:49:41,329
Jesus, Gale,
you scared the crap outta me.

1402
01:49:41,412 --> 01:49:43,831
- Isn't anybody else
down there, is there?

1403
01:49:43,914 --> 01:49:47,003
So much for reporting
from the trenches, huh?

1404
01:49:47,086 --> 01:49:50,840
- Shut up, Cotton.
- How bad is it?

1405
01:49:50,875 --> 01:49:53,259
Just bounced off my ribs.

1406
01:49:53,343 --> 01:49:55,678
Geez, Gale, you got
more lives than a cat.

1407
01:50:03,021 --> 01:50:06,441
Give me one of those.

1408
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Is she dead?
I don't know.
They always come back.

1409
01:50:23,879 --> 01:50:25,798
Whoa!

1410
01:50:41,317 --> 01:50:43,486
Just in case.

1411
01:50:52,998 --> 01:50:55,291
- That about wraps it up, Chief.
- Okay, Frank.

1412
01:50:55,326 --> 01:50:57,585
Take it easy.
You got a couple broken ribs.

1413
01:50:57,669 --> 01:50:59,756
- Greg, I'm okay.
- Sure.

1414
01:51:02,343 --> 01:51:04,428
Hey, Gale.
Are you all right?

1415
01:51:04,511 --> 01:51:07,264
- Joel.
- I'm- I'm back.

1416
01:51:07,347 --> 01:51:11,687
You know, I was thinking maybe we could
get the scoop like in the old days.

1417
01:51:11,770 --> 01:51:15,274
You're Gale Weathers...
at Windsor College.

1418
01:51:15,357 --> 01:51:17,359
We got a live one here!

1419
01:51:17,443 --> 01:51:19,361
- Move it!

1420
01:51:19,445 --> 01:51:22,950
- Where's Gale?
- There room in that one over there?

1421
01:51:23,034 --> 01:51:25,369
- Yeah! Watch your back!
- Dewey!

1422
01:51:26,287 --> 01:51:28,956
- Let's go!
- Oh, God.

1423
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:31,461
I can't believe
you're alive.

1424
01:51:31,496 --> 01:51:34,213
- Are you okay?
- Gale.

1425
01:51:34,297 --> 01:51:36,764
You hang in there.

1426
01:51:36,799 --> 01:51:40,470
- Knife went into some old scar tissue.

1427
01:51:40,553 --> 01:51:42,474
Saved his life.

1428
01:51:44,225 --> 01:51:46,478
Bye-bye.

1429
01:51:47,646 --> 01:51:50,482
- I'm coming with you.

1430
01:51:55,822 --> 01:51:58,241
- Can you tell us what you saw?
- What happened in there?

1431
01:51:58,325 --> 01:52:00,911
Can you tell us how it feels
to be a hero?

1432
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:09,338
Talk to Cotton. He's the man
you want to interview.

1433
01:52:09,421 --> 01:52:13,468
He's the hero.

1434
01:52:13,503 --> 01:52:17,515
- Cotton!

1435
01:52:17,598 --> 01:52:20,101
- What went on in there?
- Is it true you're a hero?

1436
01:52:24,691 --> 01:52:26,658
- Details, please!
- Look, guys,

1437
01:52:26,693 --> 01:52:28,695
no one wants to give you
the story more than I do.

1438
01:52:28,730 --> 01:52:31,030
Unfortunately, there is
a time and a place,

1439
01:52:31,114 --> 01:52:34,035
and indeed, a price for everything,
so feel free to call me.

1440
01:52:34,119 --> 01:52:36,287
Come on, Cotton.
Tell us something.

1441
01:52:36,371 --> 01:52:39,040
Well, uh,
I'll tell you one thing.

1442
01:52:39,124 --> 01:52:42,377
It'll make a hell of a movie.
Thank you.

1443
01:53:04,957 --> 01:53:08,544
Life's river shall rise

1444
01:53:08,628 --> 01:53:10,546
She said

1445
01:53:10,630 --> 01:53:15,885
And only the strong
shall survive, she said

1446
01:53:15,968 --> 01:53:21,390
But I'm feeling quite weak
she said

1447
01:53:21,474 --> 01:53:26,145
Will you comfort
and forgive me, she said

1448
01:53:35,821 --> 01:53:38,574
She said
she's still searching

1449
01:53:38,658 --> 01:53:41,410
For salvation's light

1450
01:53:41,494 --> 01:53:44,163
Yet she wishes all day

1451
01:53:44,247 --> 01:53:47,083
And then she prays all night

1452
01:53:49,001 --> 01:53:51,837
She said she won't
speak of love

1453
01:53:51,837 --> 01:53:54,340
'Cause love
she's never known

1454
01:54:00,096 --> 01:54:02,765
Well, it's
moments like these

1455
01:54:02,848 --> 01:54:06,435
When she hates to be alone

1456
01:54:06,519 --> 01:54:09,105
Forgive me

1457
01:54:09,188 --> 01:54:12,108
She said

1458
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:30,042
I'm sleepin' and right in
the middle of a good dream

1459
01:54:30,126 --> 01:54:34,297
When all at once I wake up
from something that keeps

1460
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:37,717
Before I go insane I hold
my pillow to my head

1461
01:54:37,717 --> 01:54:40,469
And spring up in my bed screaming out
the words I dread

1462
01:54:40,553 --> 01:54:43,890
I think I love you

1463
01:54:43,973 --> 01:54:46,642
I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of

1464
01:54:46,726 --> 01:54:51,981
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
a love there is no cure for

1465
01:54:52,064 --> 01:54:55,484
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of

1466
01:54:55,568 --> 01:54:59,322
Though it worries me to say
that I never felt this way, yeah

1467
01:54:59,405 --> 01:55:01,574
Believe me, you really
don't have to worry

1468
01:55:01,657 --> 01:55:05,745
I only wanna make you happy
And if you say hey, go away, I will

1469
01:55:05,828 --> 01:55:09,165
But I think better still
I'd better stay around and love you

1470
01:55:09,248 --> 01:55:12,084
Do you think I have a case
Let me ask you to your face

1471
01:55:12,168 --> 01:55:15,421
I think I love you

1472
01:55:15,421 --> 01:55:18,174
Yeah, I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of

1473
01:55:18,257 --> 01:55:23,429
Afraid that I'm not sure of
a love there is no cure for

1474
01:55:23,512 --> 01:55:26,933
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of

1475
01:55:27,016 --> 01:55:30,770
Though it worries me to say
that I never felt this way, yeah

1476
01:55:37,443 --> 01:55:40,613
I don't know what I'm up against,
I don't know what it's all about

1477
01:55:40,613 --> 01:55:43,282
I got so much to think about
Yeah

1478
01:55:43,282 --> 01:55:46,202
Yeah, I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of

1479
01:55:46,285 --> 01:55:51,624
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for

1480
01:55:51,624 --> 01:55:54,877
Do you think you love me

1481
01:55:54,961 --> 01:55:58,130
I think I love you

1482
01:55:58,214 --> 01:56:02,301
I think I love you

1483
01:56:03,386 --> 01:56:08,057
Pain goes away
I dig a hole

1484
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:12,728
Pain goes away
I dig a hole

1485
01:56:12,812 --> 01:56:17,567
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

1486
01:56:17,650 --> 01:56:22,655
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

1487
01:56:22,655 --> 01:56:27,076
Runnin', goin' out at night

1488
01:56:27,159 --> 01:56:31,664
Friends they
push and pull you

1489
01:56:31,747 --> 01:56:34,834
Burned out ground
Poor flowers

1490
01:56:34,917 --> 01:56:40,339
Spinning, falling outta time

1491
01:56:40,339 --> 01:56:44,927
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

1492
01:56:45,011 --> 01:56:49,599
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

1493
01:56:49,682 --> 01:56:54,186
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

1494
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:59,275
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

1495
01:56:59,358 --> 01:57:01,527
La-la-la-la, ooh

1496
01:57:01,611 --> 01:57:03,613
I'll dig a hole

1497
01:57:03,696 --> 01:57:05,781
La-la-la-la, ooh

1498
01:57:05,865 --> 01:57:10,536
When it goes away

1499
01:57:32,058 --> 01:57:33,976
I'm reminded

1500
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:36,896
Someone thought they knew me

1501
01:57:36,979 --> 01:57:41,901
That I hadn't changed at all

1502
01:57:47,990 --> 01:57:52,745
Wrapped up in a
picture perfect package

1503
01:57:52,745 --> 01:57:57,083
That just stands up
way too tall

1504
01:58:02,338 --> 01:58:06,676
Because they see my world

1505
01:58:09,512 --> 01:58:13,015
Ooh, through
the eyes of sand

1506
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:24,944
You walk in desert,
Baby, you're a polished stone

1507
01:58:24,944 --> 01:58:28,698
You walk in desert,
Baby, you're a polished stone

1508
01:58:30,116 --> 01:58:32,034
Ooh, oh

1509
01:58:32,118 --> 01:58:36,205
You don't know my world

1510
01:58:36,289 --> 01:58:40,126
You don't know my world

1511
01:58:40,209 --> 01:58:44,130
You don't know my world

1512
01:58:44,213 --> 01:58:47,550
Ah-ah

1513
01:58:47,633 --> 01:58:50,970
You walk in the desert

1514
01:58:51,053 --> 01:58:55,141
And I walk in the desert

1515
01:58:55,224 --> 01:58:57,476
Yeah, I walk in the desert

1516
01:58:57,476 --> 01:59:02,398
Scream !

1517
01:59:02,481 --> 01:59:06,319
Could be your best friend.
Could be your enemy.

1518
01:59:09,989 --> 01:59:12,491
Scream
I hear him coming

1519
01:59:12,575 --> 01:59:15,578
Scream
I hear him coming

1520
01:59:15,661 --> 01:59:17,997
I see him coming
I hear him coming, Peace

1521
01:59:17,997 --> 01:59:20,750
Y'all be trippin'
Man, the ghetto got me I know it

1522
01:59:20,833 --> 01:59:23,669
I be like eyes open, turnin'
With both of my toys on him

1523
01:59:23,753 --> 01:59:26,005
These daydreams sometimes
turn to nightmares

1524
01:59:26,005 --> 01:59:28,674
I be trying to shake it
but it seem to be like right there

1525
01:59:28,758 --> 01:59:31,844
I know some homies who made
deals for a short time to live good

1526
01:59:31,928 --> 01:59:34,680
But when its all over you should see
the data that'll put 'em out the hood

1527
01:59:34,764 --> 01:59:37,516
One, two
I'm comin' for you

1528
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:40,353
Three, four
I'm kickin' up in your door

1529
01:59:40,436 --> 01:59:43,105
This whole life
it seem to be a bad dream

1530
01:59:43,189 --> 01:59:46,108
Scream as loud as you want but
ain't nobody gonna hear your scream

1531
01:59:46,192 --> 01:59:48,861
Scream
I hear him coming

1532
01:59:48,861 --> 01:59:51,530
Scream
I hear him coming

1533
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:54,367
Scream
I hear him coming

1534
01:59:54,450 --> 01:59:57,036
Scream
I hear him coming

1535
01:59:57,119 --> 02:00:00,122
Scream
I hear him coming

1536
02:00:00,206 --> 02:00:02,708
I see him coming
I hear him coming
