00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:12,916
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,708
Hey!

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is anybody there?

4
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,083
Jesus Christ...

5
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Grab my hand.

6
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,208
Reach out.

7
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,583
All right.

8
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,083
Try again.

9
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Come on!
I'll get some help.

10
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:39,541
30 YEARS LATER

11
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,291
Dust it off.

12
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,250
Morning, guys.

13
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:39,083
Time to get out and get rid
of all the unnecessary stuff.

14
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,041
You know what I mean.

15
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,250
Just as the rules say.

16
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,416
Follow me.

17
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,708
All electronic devices, please!

18
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,875
- Julek Rosiejka.
- Spell it.

19
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:57,083
- R-O-S-I-E-J-K-A.
- Just kidding.

20
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,083
Sokołowski.

21
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,291
Like the sausage brand I don't like.

22
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,583
- Next!
- Kowalczyk.

23
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,208
- Thanks.
- Czajka.

24
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,541
- Move! We have things to do.
- Hold on!

25
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,250
And the tablet.
Come on. Chop chop!

26
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,250
- And if it gets lost?
- You get lost.

27
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,250
Aniela Turek.

28
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,333
- Wait!
- Aniela Turek.

29
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,166
- I'll take it.
- Check.

30
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,250
Wójcik.

31
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,541
- Speed it up! Name?
- Wrońska.

32
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,416
Why so sad? You are at camp.

33
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,666
- Zosia Wolska.
- Another one.

34
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,250
Take your luggage and gather here!

35
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,708
Move along, buddy. Come on.

36
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,208
Next.

37
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,416
Take your luggage off the bus!

38
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,375
Chop chop!
Put some life into it. Move it!

39
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,250
Some of you are here
for the second or even the third time.

40
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,333
Robert.

41
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,666
I am not surprised.

42
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,916
It makes me happy, though.

43
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,166
You know it's worth it, and it's fun.

44
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,583
I want this camp to be
kind of a holiday for you.

45
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,625
We'll have fun. We'll make new friends.

46
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,375
We'll enjoy nature
while dealing with our problems.

47
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,583
Why are you here?

48
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,500
Because you're addicted
to your smartphones and laptops!

49
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,833
To electronics, to technology!

50
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,750
Is it really so hard be offline?

51
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:24,666
This camp will demonstrate
that apart from it being easy,

52
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,000
it is awesome, pleasant and fantastic!

53
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,375
You'll learn new skills.

54
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,708
You'll rediscover yourselves.

55
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,666
Kids, a hearty welcome

56
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,666
to our offline survival
and trekking camp, Adrenaline!

57
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,791
Bravo!

58
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,083
- Here you go.
- Draw your numbers!

59
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,833
Go on.

60
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:57,208
The numbers represent
different groups.

61
00:07:58,708 --> 00:07:59,625
What's the best one?

62
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,750
Each group
has a different task,

63
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,291
but there is one goal
and common objective...

64
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,375
Adventure!

65
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,625
You'll be off into the wild, on your own.

66
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,041
Away from civilization.

67
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,916
- I'm four, too.
- Facing the wildlife dangers

68
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,333
every step of your way.

69
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,791
You will meet savage beasts.
Maybe even some local madmen.

70
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:28,333
A week of adventure, great fun,
and many opportunities.

71
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,375
All of which is going to be offline!

72
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,083
Adrenaline!

73
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,291
It's out of tune. Check it out.

74
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,250
Robert.

75
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:52,416
- Mustard only.
- Is there any vegan sausage?

76
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,750
Fuck, I don't eat meat!

77
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,083
It's all right.

78
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,166
Play it.

79
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,875
- With mustard.
- Mustard and ketchup for me.

80
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,666
- Smaller or bigger sausage?
- A bigger one.

81
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,625
Let's sing together now.

82
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,000
- Ketchup? Mustard?
- Mustard.

83
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,625
You all know this one.

84
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,333
- With bread or without?
- With.

85
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,958
- Join in.
- With bread.

86
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,750
A week off Instagram is really cool.

87
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,125
You don't get the updates

88
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,625
about who's in New York,
in Bali, in Sri Lanka,

89
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,208
who's running the marathon,

90
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:37,291
who's having halibut
with sun-dried tomatoes and green pepper.

91
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,666
This makes me feel stupid,
because I only run

92
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,583
when the elevator is out of order.
I stay home and eat pasta with ketchup.

93
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,583
Mmm.

94
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,416
And here you know nothing.
Pure detox.

95
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,166
Hey.

96
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,833
Ewa, come on!

97
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,083
Attention, campers!

98
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,875
Fifteen minutes to lights-out!

99
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,666
ADRENALINE
OFFLINE TREKKING CAMP

100
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,208
Wake up!

101
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,083
- Hot water is on!
- Coming!

102
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,281
That's my toilet paper!

103
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,250
MEN'S ROOM

104
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,958
God Almighty, I'm asking you,

105
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,791
through the blessed virgin
and all the holy angels,

106
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,583
grace us with the will
to chase away the evil

107
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,500
from those young hearts
addicted to dangerous technology.

108
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,666
Through the passion of our Lord Jesus,
His holy blood which He shed for us,

109
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,250
through His wounds and His agony.

110
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,958
Jesus, send down your angels,
so they may drive, uh...

111
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,875
the sinister forces of civilization
into the depths of hell.

112
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,791
Let your kingdom
enter the hearts of your servants

113
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,000
and relieve them of their evil addictions.

114
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,625
Hi!

115
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,958
I'm Iza, the leader of your group.

116
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,958
Girls, are you comfortable?

117
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,791
Thank you.

118
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:39,166
We're off for a three-day hike.
It's a heck of a trip,

119
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:44,000
so we stay close, we make an effort,
we keep up, and no one lags behind.

120
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,083
Is that clear?

121
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,166
Who is the slowest one in the group?

122
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,708
And why is everyone looking at...
What's your name?

123
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,666
- Julek.
- Julek?

124
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,541
He'll surprise you all, you'll see.
Well, off we go!

125
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:48,833
Hi, there.

126
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,166
Your necklace looks just like T-800.

127
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,125
Excuse me?

128
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,708
T-800. Arnold from <i>The Terminator.</i>

129
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,833
Oh.

130
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,250
No, it's just a family memento.

131
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,416
But it really looks like T-800.

132
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,458
And you look a bit like Sarah Connor.

133
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,708
Wasn't she a blonde?

134
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,375
I mean your face.

135
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:24,083
"I'm a cybernetic organism.
My mission is to protect you."

136
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,375
"I'll be back."

137
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,166
- Do you practice any sports?
- Nope.

138
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,250
- Do you?
- You know...

139
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,416
- Not much.
- You look athletic, though.

140
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:13,958
You know...

141
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,875
In my spare time...

142
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,083
Right!

143
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,875
Gym and pool every day,
and weekend marathons?

144
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,958
Yeah.

145
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,750
A bit of swimming,

146
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,458
a bit of cycling.

147
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,041
Hey, Daniel?

148
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,125
What?

149
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,375
- Are you a selfie fan?
- Jesus!

150
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,458
What?

151
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,166
Do you like taking selfies?

152
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,958
- Fuck off, pal.
- You do, don't you?

153
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,875
Do you shave your legs, too?

154
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,833
Bartek, let him be.

155
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,833
- Daniel?
- I'll shave yours.

156
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:04,541
Cyclists shave.
Maybe you are a pro.

157
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,458
- Bartek!
- Maybe you like sucking dick.

158
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,458
Jesus... Bartek!

159
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,381
- Are you nuts?
- What was that?

160
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:14,958
Everything okay?

161
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,041
You're no better than him.

162
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Okay...

163
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,291
All right. Let's get it cleaned up.

164
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,791
Right, so... enough.

165
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,291
Give me two of those.

166
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,208
You're not so eloquent now, are you?

167
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,500
Okay. Uh...

168
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,833
And now...

169
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,375
Gosh, I have no scissors.

170
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,791
All set. Let's move.

171
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,625
Can you get up?

172
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,750
- Sorry.
- I got carried away.

173
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,666
Can I go for a quick pee?

174
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,208
Hurry up.

175
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,916
Let's get ready.

176
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,208
Backpacks on.

177
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Help me.

178
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:51,916
Oh, shit!

179
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,125
Fuck me!

180
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,375
Shit.

181
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,958
Hey! Come over here!

182
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,416
- Hunters?
- Nope.

183
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,791
Not hunters.

184
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,708
A carnivore of some sort.

185
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,583
A big one.

186
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,166
Fifteen thousand people
disappear in Poland each year,

187
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,708
a third of them in the woods.

188
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,750
- We can add to the statistics.
- That's not funny.

189
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,708
Is this your first time in a forest?

190
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,750
- Relax.
- That's right.

191
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:25,583
Animals don't attack for no reason.
And Totter-Tot will protect us.

192
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,458
Let's move on!

193
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,958
Ew.

194
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,083
That deer was something else,
wasn't it?

195
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:58,083
Have you watched
<i>An American Werewolf in London?</i>

196
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,583
It goes like this...

197
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:05,291
Two guys go hiking through the woods,
just like us now.

198
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,916
They walk and hear a kind of growling.

199
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,750
Like a dog or a hare or a wolf.

200
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,583
They ignore it and walk on.

201
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,583
And there's that growling again,

202
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,125
kind of circling them.

203
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:24,083
They keep walking,
and one of them gets attacked!

204
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,041
He gets his arm bitten off...

205
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Daniel?

206
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:40,833
Yeah?

207
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,791
I have no idea how to do it.

208
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:48,833
Maybe like this?

209
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,875
I'll do it.

210
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,125
I need to bathe.
I feel icky after that walk.

211
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,458
Julek, why are you here?

212
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,125
- Gaming.
- Computer gaming?

213
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,250
Console gaming as well.

214
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,166
Go on, Julek.

215
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,166
Everyone shares.

216
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,416
Go on.

217
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:07,541
I play games.

218
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:12,250
I'm the second-best player in Poland.

219
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,166
I stream. I run a YouTube channel.

220
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,934
- I was going to fly to...
- How many subscribers?

221
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:21,875
- ...Korea for championships, but...
- How many subscribers?

222
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:25,958
- I have a channel, too.
- Exactly 900,334.

223
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:30,833
And you?

224
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:35,916
- More or less the same.
- Julek, go on.

225
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,208
You mentioned Korea.

226
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,291
Uh...

227
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:42,875
I was planning to take part
in the championship games,

228
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:47,958
but my parents cut me off the internet
and sent me here.

229
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:51,875
- On probation.
- There are camps in Korea, too.

230
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,083
Joke.

231
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,583
You can win half a million dollars.

232
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,958
So, you dropped out of school because...

233
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,000
you spent too much time on the web.

234
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,708
Who else had problems at school
for the very same reason?

235
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:17,958
Nobody.

236
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:19,291
Just like I thought.

237
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,333
And I heard that all of you did.

238
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,166
And it's Zosia's turn.

239
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:29,083
Zosia Wolska.

240
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,416
What have we here?

241
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:34,791
Zosia.

242
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,208
Uh, Zosia...

243
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:43,875
Um...

244
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Let's leave that for tomorrow.
Or whenever you'd like. Okay?

245
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,708
- Did you hear that?
- What is it?

246
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,875
Something's out there.

247
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,125
- Sit!
- Ow!

248
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Stay put.

249
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,583
Miss Iza?

250
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:39,166
- Yeah?
- Be careful.

251
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,125
Good idea.

252
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:05,916
What a cutie.

253
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:08,291
A little fox.

254
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:11,666
- I wish you'd seen him. Enough for today.
- You all shit your pants.

255
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,750
Bedtime!

256
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:01,041
Puffety puff.

257
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:19,833
That's better.

258
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:31,375
Jesus.

259
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,250
Wanna give me a heart attack?

260
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:38,875
I can't sleep with all that noise.

261
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
What noise?

262
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:47,666
All those crickets, owls,
ticks and whatnot.

263
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,875
Uh-huh.

264
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,125
And how about you?

265
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,333
- Just chillin'.
- So I see. Give me a hit.

266
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:00,416
You smoke?

267
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:09,541
We have similar names.

268
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,333
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

269
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:18,208
Daniel, Aniela. Add a D, take away the A.

270
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:21,750
Coincidence? I don't think so.
Do you have a girlfriend?

271
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,333
No. I mean, yes.

272
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:26,625
Sometimes.

273
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:28,541
You know how it is.

274
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:31,916
No, I don't.

275
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,041
Well...

276
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,750
I date several girls.

277
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,166
Depends on the day.

278
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,750
I've got something, too.

279
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,458
You know what it is?

280
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:56,958
Mmm-hmm.

281
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So?

282
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,333
- Meaning?
- You want me to help you?

283
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,958
No, there's no need... I mean, uh...

284
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:10,000
No.

285
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:13,916
I don't need help.

286
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,083
What's wrong?

287
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:30,333
Nothing. Uh...

288
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:33,458
You're gay?

289
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:35,708
No.

290
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,500
I just...

291
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:42,583
It's the nerves.

292
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:46,083
I don't know...

293
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,750
No!

294
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,791
You're a virgin?

295
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:02,416
- And you said you had someone.
- I did.

296
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,750
- Over the internet.
- Mmm.

297
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:10,208
So you've had cybersex only?

298
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:15,708
Sorry.

299
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:35,583
In that case, call me "Teacher."

300
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,166
How was it?

301
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,375
I need to crash.

302
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,250
But we'll do it again, right?

303
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:02,500
We'll see. Goodnight!

304
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:05,166
Thanks.

305
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:25,541
Wait.

306
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:27,958
Let's get this out.

307
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,750
Right.

308
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:32,833
Before falling asleep.

309
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:38,166
Oh.

310
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,333
Mmm...

311
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

312
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,916
Julek! Wake Zosia and Daniel up.

313
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,583
- He's not here.
- What do you mean?

314
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:58,041
He is not here.
He's not in his tent.

315
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:02,208
- Maybe he went to shave his legs.
- So where is he?

316
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:03,791
Anyone seen Daniel?

317
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:08,541
- Did he say he was leaving?
- How should I know?

318
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:13,250
- Who's seen him last?
- Maybe something happened to him?

319
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:26,291
All right.

320
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,458
Who was the last person to see him?

321
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:39,125
Me. We sat by the water together.

322
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:41,166
And?

323
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,291
"Now I'm pregnant."

324
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,875
Show me the exact spot.

325
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:01,125
Uh, that's not mine.

326
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:09,125
- What else did you two do?
- Nothing.

327
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:12,458
You had to do something.

328
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,916
We sat. We chatted.
I went to bed.

329
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:18,458
That's cool.

330
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:22,791
- What did you talk about?
- Just piss off.

331
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,892
- Why won't you tell me?
- Fuck off.

332
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:26,916
Hey!

333
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Take a look.

334
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:38,791
Looks like blood.

335
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,916
- That's massive.
- What's up?

336
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:45,458
Blood.

337
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:50,833
No, that is...

338
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,791
- What?
- That is probably sap.

339
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:02,500
- Sap of that color?
- Sure. Lots of trees secrete juices.

340
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:03,458
What are they called?

341
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,309
- Their color is similar to...
- They don't grow in Poland.

342
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:09,000
- They sometimes do.
- Like where?

343
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,083
- Like here.
- That's blood.

344
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:13,166
No.

345
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:15,791
No. That's...

346
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:18,291
Listen, stop panicking, all right?

347
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:21,125
- We should look for him.
- Or head back.

348
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,666
Okay, go back. We'll look.

349
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,000
Let's take a vote. I say we get back.

350
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:28,541
Stop panicking. All right.

351
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:32,458
Bartek and Aniela stay here
in case Daniel shows up.

352
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:33,916
Don't go anywhere. Clear?

353
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:38,541
- Zosia and I will look around.
- So we split up?

354
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:41,125
- We have to.
- Can I say something?

355
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:43,208
- Be brief.
- In horror movies,

356
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:47,541
when groups split up, people die.

357
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,583
- Julek, please!
- Relax.

358
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:54,791
I'd feel more relaxed
if we called the police.

359
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:56,791
We have no phones.

360
00:39:56,875 --> 00:40:01,500
If we don't find him in an hour,
we'll head back to base. Clear?

361
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:02,663
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

362
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:06,250
- And what about me?
- I don't know... Stay.

363
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:07,958
Wait for the police.

364
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,166
What a bummer.

365
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,375
Daniel!

366
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:25,083
Daniel!

367
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:31,083
- Can I say one more thing?
- No!

368
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:39,291
In horror movies,
there are six deadly sins.

369
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:45,208
Curiosity. "I wonder what's inside.
Let's take a peep."

370
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:47,250
Disbelief.

371
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:51,541
"It's just my imagination.
No need to fear."

372
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:55,791
Confidence. "I'm going inside.
Why shouldn't I?"

373
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:58,541
That was number three.

374
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:03,166
Number four,
unattractive people never survive.

375
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,541
Five, sex.

376
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:07,416
Sex is a death sentence.

377
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:12,000
And six, splitting up,
just like we are doing now.

378
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:15,416
Let me.

379
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:17,458
Thanks.

380
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:26,375
What if they don't come back?

381
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:31,750
Why shouldn't they?

382
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:35,916
No idea.

383
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:38,291
Hypothetically.

384
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,875
If we were to be left alone here...

385
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:47,083
what would you do?

386
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:51,166
Hmm...

387
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:07,916
What's that?

388
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:11,875
Let's get in.

389
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:16,250
- But it's private property.
- Julek!

390
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,791
Give it a break.
Maybe they've seen Daniel.

391
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:23,666
I won't squeeze through.

392
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:28,666
Hello?

393
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,166
What a fucking mess.

394
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:55,708
Hello?

395
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:01,833
Good morning!

396
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:14,458
Is anybody here?

397
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:16,666
Excuse me.

398
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:27,500
No one's here. Let's get back.

399
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:39,083
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

400
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:51,041
Oh! Hi, little one.

401
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:58,666
Wait, wait...

402
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:04,208
Miss Iza...

403
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,000
Miss Iza...

404
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,208
Zosia, be careful.

405
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:43,541
Oh, Jesus.

406
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

407
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:09,208
Someone's coming!

408
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:16,666
Let's fucking run!

409
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:19,875
- He's coming!
- Hide! Quick!

410
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:23,125
Someone's fucking coming!

411
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Quiet!

412
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,458
Be quiet.

413
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,916
- Calm down. Get a grip.
- Fuck.

414
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:39,916
Quick!

415
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:43,642
- I can't climb!
- Julek!

416
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:45,708
- Hurry up!
- You can squeeze through.

417
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:46,791
Hurry!

418
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:57,958
Miss Iza!

419
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:01,875
Run!

420
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:13,000
Come on, you pimply dumbass!

421
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Fuck...
- Miss Iza?

422
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:38,500
I always knew I was gay.

423
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,833
You just feel it.

424
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:44,833
But I still need to hide it.

425
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:49,458
Try being gay in this country.

426
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:51,583
It sucks.

427
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:54,000
Don't take it to heart.

428
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:56,375
Seriously?

429
00:48:57,583 --> 00:49:00,333
You're a nice, intelligent guy.

430
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:05,000
I am constantly being labeled, too.

431
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,541
A dumb bimbo, a blonde.

432
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:11,166
Just good enough for a fuck.

433
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:16,666
But I just ignore the rules,
and I'm happy with it.

434
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,541
But deep inside...

435
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,541
I wish I could find...

436
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:25,083
true love.

437
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:28,708
A real true love.

438
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:37,625
Is he chasing us?

439
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:40,625
Now what?

440
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:43,375
I don't know.

441
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:44,916
Game over.

442
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,125
Game over.

443
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:49,333
It's fucking over.
What are we going to do?

444
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,958
Fucking locals, Poland "B."
What is this? What am I doing here?

445
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:56,416
I told you all not to come here!

446
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,833
- But nobody listened! I want to go home!
- Julek!

447
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:01,791
Get it together.

448
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:08,916
Julek...

449
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:13,750
It will be all right, okay?
Just calm down.

450
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:26,750
- We should go back for Daniel's phone.
- No, let's not do that. Please.

451
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:39,041
Okay, listen. Here's what we'll do.

452
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:41,208
We move on. We find some help.

453
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:43,375
We can do this.

454
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:46,875
Promise?

455
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:52,916
Promise.

456
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:56,541
My father is blind to everything...

457
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:03,041
He'd sooner believe I was
a far-right extremist than a faggot.

458
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:07,958
I guess that's his fantasy of me.

459
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,000
Even when I invite a boyfriend home...

460
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:17,708
he thinks it's just a friend.

461
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:23,583
If I ever grabbed the friend's butt
in front of him,

462
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:27,333
he'd be likely to think... I don't know.

463
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:30,791
He'd take it for a macho goodbye.

464
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:35,708
The guy is...

465
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
so fucking out of touch with reality.

466
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:58,083
Let's get back to Aniela and Bartek,
if they're still alive.

467
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:02,291
- Don't say that!
- We wouldn't find them anyway.

468
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:05,750
We have no idea where we are.
We're running in circles.

469
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:09,291
Even if the fat guy doesn't kill us,
starvation will.

470
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:14,958
I can't imagine us fishing,
eating moss, hunting, or mushroom picking.

471
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:17,250
Poor Miss Iza...

472
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:18,458
Shut it!

473
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,166
Hello?

474
00:53:57,583 --> 00:53:58,583
Open up!

475
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:04,166
Morning.

476
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:05,833
Will you help us?

477
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:07,208
Our friends are dead.

478
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:11,875
There was an accident. We need help.
Will you let us in?

479
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:30,416
The door!

480
00:54:43,916 --> 00:54:46,291
Is there a phone here?
We need to make a call.

481
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:51,708
Tell me what happened.

482
00:54:58,083 --> 00:55:01,166
I don't know how to say it,
as this will sound weird...

483
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:06,166
- You won't believe us anyway.
- I've seen many strange things.

484
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:12,125
We found this fucking huge man,
all crooked and deformed.

485
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:16,333
He attacked us, and then killed
our friend and our guide.

486
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,208
What? "Killed"?

487
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:23,458
Something is fucked up
and people are dying.

488
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:27,625
Have you been drinking? Taking drugs?

489
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:30,541
No.

490
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:39,291
All right.

491
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:42,291
Calm down.

492
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:46,083
I can't calm down!
I need to call the police or somebody!

493
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:47,541
Or else we're doomed.

494
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:06,791
Sit down.

495
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:20,791
I don't have a phone.

496
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:22,375
I have a mobile.

497
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:24,208
But we're out of range.

498
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:26,916
Let's try the landline.

499
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:36,875
No signal.

500
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:41,166
We've been having
some violent storms recently.

501
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:46,666
Maybe we should go
to the police station together.

502
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:52,041
But you claim that people
are getting killed.

503
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:56,041
So would that be really safe?

504
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:08,208
Calm down.

505
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:12,916
Come on.

506
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:15,958
There.

507
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,875
Hi, again.

508
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,625
I remember you from last year.

509
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:04,291
I know your kind.

510
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,250
Clingy.

511
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:10,958
Enticing.

512
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:15,833
Ready to lure others in.

513
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:21,291
You are a bit like...

514
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:23,875
the plague.

515
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:36,875
Wait here.

516
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

517
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:26,833
Jesus!

518
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:06,416
You don't know who you're dealing with.

519
01:02:08,166 --> 01:02:09,541
I first encountered them...

520
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,041
a long time ago.

521
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:15,875
I have a souvenir from that meeting.

522
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:18,625
I'll keep it till death.

523
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:23,375
"Them"?

524
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:25,875
Uh-huh.

525
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:27,875
Two of them.

526
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:30,291
What?

527
01:02:37,166 --> 01:02:38,166
Once...

528
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:41,625
there was a family living in these parts.

529
01:02:43,666 --> 01:02:46,416
A mom and her two boys. Twins.

530
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:53,208
They led a rather poor life,
but they loved each other dearly.

531
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,416
They were happy.

532
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:00,458
And everything was fine
until one fateful afternoon.

533
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:46,833
Whoa.

534
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:21,875
"Once upon a time,

535
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:24,583
in her gloomy hut

536
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:28,375
there lived a witch as ugly as a bat.

537
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,291
She ate little girls at morn.

538
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:34,791
On little boys she supped.

539
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:38,625
She'd ride her broom

540
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:41,958
to the village and back,

541
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:46,750
to stuff plump little children
into her great big sack.

542
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:50,500
But before they reached the pot,

543
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:54,500
she would sing this to the lot.

544
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:58,458
<i>♪ Nobody sleeps in the woods tonight ♪</i>

545
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:03,708

546
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:06,958
Goodnight.

547
01:05:08,625 --> 01:05:09,958
Goodnight, Mommy.

548
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:13,708

<i>♪ Nobody sleeps in the woods tonight ♪</i>

550
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:30,958
In the name of...

551
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,375
Boys?

552
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

553
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,416
She was in shock.

554
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:22,333
She put them in chains
and locked them in the cellar

555
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:24,875
so that no one ever found out.

556
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,166
And so that they'd never come out.

557
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:30,833
Years passed...

558
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:34,083
and she fed them and hid them.

559
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,250
Until she lost her mind.

560
01:09:36,916 --> 01:09:38,833
Anyone would go insane...

561
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:45,791
Poor dear woman, innocent as a lamb.

562
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:47,958
Completely nuts.

563
01:09:56,708 --> 01:09:59,750
We really have to go and fetch some help.

564
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:04,541
Stay here if you want to survive.

565
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:08,625
I have a gun. I have food.

566
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:13,791
And we would just wait?

567
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:18,250
- Maybe it's not such a bad idea?
- You're free to go.

568
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:22,166
You'll reach the nearest village
in two days.

569
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:26,916
As you wish.

570
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:29,083
Your choice.

571
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:40,333
We can't just sit around.

572
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,875
Let's get Daniel's phone.
We have no choice.

573
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,625
Zosia, be careful.

574
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:39,958
- What's he doing down there?
- Get back!

575
01:11:41,666 --> 01:11:43,375
- Is he there?
- Shush!

576
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,291
Get a grip! Here's what we'll do.

577
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:50,375
- We wait for him to leave.
- What if he doesn't leave for a week?

578
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:52,916
Do you have a better idea?

579
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:57,208
Julek!

580
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:04,458
I'll make some noise out front.
You get in.

581
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:08,416
- All right.
- I distract him. You grab the phone.

582
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:10,250
Okay.

583
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:11,791
No, wait!

584
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,125
- And if he chases you?
- I'll run.

585
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,500
- See you in a moment.
- Julek...

586
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:22,833
can you run?

587
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:24,625
Mmm-hmm.

588
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,416
Zosia, we will do fine, right?

589
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:29,541
We will do just fine.

590
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:31,291
All right.

591
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:32,750
Wait!

592
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:36,833
Take this. Just in case.

593
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,791
Open up, you fat asshole!

594
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:41,625
Hey!

595
01:15:17,791 --> 01:15:19,291
Let her go!

596
01:15:31,916 --> 01:15:33,041
I'm sorry.

597
01:16:59,791 --> 01:17:01,125
Julek!

598
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:04,500
Fuck!

599
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:08,416
Julek!

600
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:16,333
Wait. I'll call for help. Just wait.
It will be all right.

601
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:20,666
Julek...

602
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,291
What?

603
01:18:46,041 --> 01:18:47,083
I don't understand.

604
01:18:53,833 --> 01:18:55,250
I don't understand a word.

605
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:01,583
Everything will be fine.

606
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,500
It will be fine.

607
01:19:20,458 --> 01:19:21,541
Sarah Connor...

608
01:19:27,541 --> 01:19:29,125
That's not from <i>The Terminator.</i>

609
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:32,291
That's Captain Walrus.

610
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:40,833
I found him on a summer holiday
I spent with my parents.

611
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:48,125
My sister called him Captain Walrus,
you know?

612
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:57,833
Put an end to this, please.

613
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:01,833
Finish me off.

614
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,791
No, I can't. I can't.

615
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:16,708
Come on in... you motherfucker.

616
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:31,458
The last call I had,
a panicked guy phoned

617
01:29:31,541 --> 01:29:34,708
saying a black guy
was repairing the waterworks.

618
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:38,291
Or a woman was driving a bus.

619
01:29:38,375 --> 01:29:40,833
A woman behind the wheel?

620
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:45,958
Once in a blue moon,
something serious happens.

621
01:29:46,041 --> 01:29:49,708
I catch a drunk shithead driving.

622
01:29:49,791 --> 01:29:54,125
And it always turns out
that his father is someone important,

623
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:57,000
and I get a massive pile of shit
instead of a medal.

624
01:29:57,583 --> 01:30:00,875
Dear officer, this is Poland,
not <i>Miami Vice.</i>

625
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:07,291
Last time I used a firearm?
At training in 1992.

626
01:30:08,916 --> 01:30:11,916
My brother joined the force, too,

627
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,416
but he said, "Fuck it,"
and opened a repair garage.

628
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:20,125
Which is good, 'cause I can fix
this car there. On my expense.

629
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,416
I keep applying for a new one.

630
01:30:24,208 --> 01:30:25,208
Nothing.

631
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:30,125
And that's how I serve the force.

632
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:34,875
Fucking life runs through my fingers
day in and day out.

633
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:37,875
And I achieve nothing.

634
01:30:58,708 --> 01:30:59,708
Right.

635
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:04,333
So... I'll be going, hon.

636
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:19,666
See you on Tuesday.

637
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,250

646
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:17,333
Are you hurt?

647
01:32:55,791 --> 01:32:56,833

01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:04,375

Are you all right?
