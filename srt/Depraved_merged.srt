1
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,714
And you're just
watching this woman

2
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,083
this mind just like

3
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:01,086
shut down bit by bit, you know?

4
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,557
<i>I know it's hard seeing that.</i>

5
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,993
Yeah, but... but then
the moment you're back

6
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,729
in the, in the singing,
she's just like alive again.

7
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,866
She starts with these
kind of like, these moves.

8
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:15,868
<i>And you know..</i>

9
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,171
<i>I guess she's..</i>

10
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,375
That it's, it's okay.

11
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:26,044
It's very sweet that you visit.
You're a good grandson.

12
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,647
Well, yeah, she's my nana.

13
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,384
You'll be a good dad.
And such a good, sweet dad.

14
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,853
Lucy, come on,
why are you doin' that?

15
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,321
I'm... I'm moving in with you.

16
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,423
I think... I think that should
be enough for right now.

17
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:42,461
Oh, okay, I was just saying,
I don't know

18
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:45,531
I thought... I thought you were
sweet and I just wanna meet

19
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:48,267
our little Alex or Alexandria.

20
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,636
It is just so totally,
totally insane

21
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,804
that you're talking about
having kids when we..

22
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:56,975
I, I know I get it, I know.
I was just.. God, nothing.

23
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,211
Just... just think about it
for a second.

24
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:02,581
I mean, you work at a museum
and I do web design

25
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,483
for a company
that's downsizing every week.

26
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,951
I mean, that's a... that's a
great environment

27
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,519
to be bringing a kid into.

28
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,055
<i>I was... I was just saying
that you'd be a good dad.</i>

29
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,457
<i>Nobody's bringing any kids
into anything.</i>

30
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:18,130
Look, we've been out of college
for like ten minutes.

31
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,265
<i>Well, look at you now,
you're doing the hair thing.</i>

32
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,567
<i>Don't start freaking out.</i>

33
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,769
I'm not freaking out,
I'm fixing my hair.

34
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:27,005
You are<i> so</i> defensive. I..

35
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,674
I was just trying..

36
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,610
God, I don't even know what..

37
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,147
<i>See what you do is, you just,
you keep setting me up</i>

38
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:38,850
<i>to become a disappointment,
you know?</i>

39
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,385
<i>Every time you raise the bar
and I can't keep up</i>

40
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,957
<i>I have to feel like a fucking
asshole. Because you know why?</i>

41
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,592
<i>'Cause it makes me feel like
I don't love you enough</i>

42
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,927
<i>when I don't want to have kids
with you when we're like 23...</i>

43
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,829
You're obviously having
a total meltdown.

44
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,165
Do you just..
You don't wanna do this.

45
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,202
No, of course, I wanna do this.

46
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,075
But I am gonna go.

47
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,145
What, now... now you're mad?

48
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,981
I'm not mad, I just..

49
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,719
I have to see
nana in the morning

50
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:16,455
<i>and it makes more sense for me
to be at my place.</i>

51
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,692
I'm sorry to disappoint.

52
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,067
Well, aren't you, at least,
gonna put this on?

53
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,069
It's your birthday present.

54
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,340
Yeah.

55
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:40,245
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

56
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,622
Happy Birthday.

57
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,425
Thanks, babe.

58
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,931
It's.. Stay, we don't have to
talk about anything anymore.

59
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,433
Oh, come on, baby.

60
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:07,406
I'll call you, alright?
We got tomorrow.

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

62
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,035
You're awake.

63
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,905
You're up.

64
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,640
You're... you're... you're up!

65
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,242
Oh, okay.

66
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,545
Uh, okay.

67
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,481
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, uh.

68
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,316
Oh, uh, ca... can you say that?

69
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,685
Can you say o... okay?

70
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,353
Try to say "Okay."

71
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,660
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

72
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,763
I had a pulse yesterday.

73
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,170
I, uh, I have to name you.

74
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:39,844
Adam? It's so corny.

75
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,113
I..

76
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,016
Shit! I can't think. Um..

77
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,089
Adam.

78
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,934
Adam.

79
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,304
I'm Henry.

80
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,940
I'm your..

81
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:18,016
Uh..

82
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:21,720
Wait, uh, we need
to get a picture..

83
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:24,889
For you Uncle Polidori.

84
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:31,129
This is where you'll stay!

85
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,530
Oh.

86
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,893
This is your room.

87
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,462
Recover here and become strong.

88
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,799
You will stay here.

89
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,234
You will not leave

90
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,736
until we are ready,
you understand?

91
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,073
You understand?

92
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,575
I want you..

93
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,078
To be safe.

94
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:30,355
And the most important
thing for you..

95
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,492
Will be sleep..

96
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,429
So your brain can recover.

97
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,290
<i>She started
these kind of like, these moves.</i>

98
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,025
<i>And, you know..</i>

99
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,295
<i>I guess she's..</i>

100
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,799
<i>That it's, it's okay.</i>

<i>It's very sweet
that you would say that.</i>
<i>- You're a good grandson.
- Well, yeah, she's my nana.</i>
Alex.

102
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:27,312
It's okay, Adam. It's okay.

103
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,913
Let's put these on.

104
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:37,188
So, let's get you checked out,
okay, Adam?

105
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,234
Open. Close.

106
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,975
Now, Adam, you need drugs.

107
00:12:56,977 --> 00:13:00,945
Don't worry.
Most of America is on drugs.

108
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,914
Uh, uppers, downers

109
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,117

Somebody is very eager
to meet you.

113
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,438
Okay, now for you, we have got..

114
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,675

No, no, no, no, no.

129
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,478
The ones that match.
Put 'em together.

130
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,449
No. The moon, the moon.

131
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,984

00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:57,028
There you go.
Put it where it matches.

136
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,637

You just have to look,
use your eyes and your ear."

148
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,059
You like that left side
of your brain huh?

149
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,062
Let's try this one.

And then an experiment.

Here we go.

162
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,396

You can do it
because it's all there.

168
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:44,796
It's still in your head.
You can access that information.

like if you'd had a stroke

173

00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,147
<i>all those little synapses.</i>

177
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,183
They will find
another way around.

178
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:08,719
I mean, the plasticity
of the brain is fantastic

179
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:12,957
<i>and what better stimulus
then self.</i>

180
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:16,661
<i>But regularity
leaves impressions</i>

181
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,696
<i>and creates a space</i>

182
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,732
<i>for the mind to rejuvenate.</i>

183
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:25,236
<i>Look at you go!
Adam! Puzzle master!</i>

184
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:39,784
<i>Alright, you heard Bach
and then you heard Beethoven</i>

185
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,719
<i>and then America came along.</i>

186
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:46,290
<i>America gave us jazz
and the blues.</i>

187
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,059
Pretty great, right?

188
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,928
This..

189
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,332
Is gravity.

190
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:58,669
Gravity makes the ball go down.

191
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:05,476
Gravity also keeps you
on the ground.

192
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:10,047
Gravity is your friend.

193
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,184
Now you try.

194
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
<i>Good, again.</i>

195
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,601
Gravity.

196
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,404
What?

197
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,809
Gravity is..

198
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,978
Your friend.

199
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,413
My God, yes.

200
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:45,516
Gravity is..

201
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,287
Your friend.

202
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,855
Yes! Yes!

203
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,891
Gravity is your friend.

204
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:57,495
Yes! Yes!
That's it. Say it louder.

205
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:01,332
Gravity is your friend.

206
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,635
Gravity is your friend.

207
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,070
Yes, say it again.

208
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:09,073
Gravity is your friend.

209
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,908
The boy talks!

210
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,544
Gravity is your friend.

211
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,413
What about dancing? Try dancing.

212
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,282
Uh, okay, no. We'll try
that later, that's fine.

213
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,052
Okay, let it drop.

214
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,089
Ping pong.

215
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:30,528
Ping pong.

216
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,696
<i>Good.</i>

217
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,632
This is your paddle,
this is the ball.

218
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,167
I'm gonna drop the ball..

219
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,102
And hit it over to you.

220
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,503
You hit it back.

221
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,479
Good. But, no.

222
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:49,814
<i>Give me the ball.</i>

223
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,784
<i>Pick up the paddle.</i>

224
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,886
<i>Hit the ball to you</i>

225
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:58,823
<i>you hit it
with the paddle, okay?</i>

226
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,157
Let's try again.

227
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:04,495
Good!

228
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,870
<i>Come on, man,
you got to hit it back.</i>

229
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,101
<i>Fuck!</i>

230
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,707
I'm sorry,
I'm not mad at you, alright?

231
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,076
I'm just mad at myself.

232
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:01,252
<i>Mad at myself. Mad at myself.</i>

233
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:02,753
<i>Mad at myself.</i>

234
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,224
Henry is hiding.

235
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:10,394
<i>If Simon is
hiding where can he be?</i>

236
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:13,397
<i>Hiding under the Truffula tree.</i>

237
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,800
<i>Sure and steady.</i>

238
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:32,950
<i>You'll be a good dad.
And such a good, sweet dad.</i>

239
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,985
<i>And such a good, sweet dad.</i>

240
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:08,986
Adam.

241
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,488
<i>Hope you're not
wandering around at night.</i>

242
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,723
<i>Sleep is very important.</i>

243
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,461
<i>No, he's not ready
to be shown, alright?</i>

244
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,263
<i>I'm still worried
about regression.</i>

245
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,866
<i>The, the brain may be
immunologically privileged</i>

246
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:24,468
<i>but the rest of his body
is just a battle ground</i>

247
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,971
<i>of tissues aching to go at it.</i>

248
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:29,340
<i>Yes, I am just being cautious.</i>

249
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:32,643
<i>If there's even a whiff of
rejection and inflammation</i>

250
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:36,113
<i>the whole protocol
will be called into question.</i>

251
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,315
Well, they should be concerned
if they're legit.

252
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,651
So, I want to be sure.

253
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,857
<i>I'm not sad you're away.
Thank God you're away.</i>

254
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,325
<i>He wouldn't last a week</i>

255
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,960
<i>with your hyped up energy
around here.</i>

256
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:54,965
<i>He's recovering, you understand?</i>

257
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,301
<i>He's not some junk bond
you can just flip.</i>

258
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,037
<i>Okay.</i>

259
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,506
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

260
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,851
That was your Uncle Polidori
on the phone.

261
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:15,586
He's very eager to meet you.

262
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:19,023
Just come out here,
let me get a look at you.

263
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:26,397
That's good. You look good.

264
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:27,998
There's one thing though,
you see these buttons

265
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,001
how they're uneven? Fix that.

266
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:41,312
Yeah!

267
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,614
But see, dude,
you forgot to shave your lip.

268
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:45,916
Good job, buddy.

269
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:04,235
<i>I bet you think..</i>

270
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:07,471
<i>Your name is Adam because of..</i>

271
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,341
<i>The Bible.</i>

272
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:15,079
<i>Adam and Eve first
man, all that crap.</i>

273
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:18,282
<i>Or maybe you..</i>

274
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,751
<i>Don't even remember
what the Bible is.</i>

275
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:24,788
<i>Yeah, I have been busy.</i>

276
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,826
Well, I work at the clinic
a couple days a week.

277
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:31,529
<i>Yes, I've been taking
my medications.</i>

278
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,532
I feel better.

279
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:37,968
I wanna see you too,
but you know I'm at the clinic.

280
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,305
Polidori's got me
on this project.

281
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:46,877
Jesus!
Let me call you back, Liz.

282
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,379
Don't sneak up on me like that.

283
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,281
Turn that fuckin' thing off!

284
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,050
Here.

285
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,505
<i>Woo Hoo! That's my boy!</i>

286
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:28,852
<i>Adam, now there you are.</i>

287
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:32,156
<i>Hiding, huh?
I hope you're hungry.</i>

288
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:36,393
I'm sorry that I was away today.

289
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:38,697
I, uh..

290
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,201
I don't know, I guess I'm..

291
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:48,372
Not used to any of this.

292
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,414
Does that hurt?

293
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,454
Why don't I remember?

294
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,424
Remember what?

295
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:13,530
Why don't I remember
being small?

296
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:17,501
Huh, don't you?

297
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:25,309
Well, you had a trauma.

298
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,980
That's what we're dealing with.

299
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,251
If your brain could remember.

300
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,489
I do remember.

301
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:41,625
What?

302
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,428
A face.

303
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:46,964
Really?

304
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,334
Well..

305
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:53,203
The brain plays..

306
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:55,706
Lots of tricks, Adam.

307
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,644
I had..

308
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,981
A certain kinda brain
when I was young.

309
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:07,718
And I remembered a lot.

310
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,122
And I went to medical school.

311
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,458
<i>And I kicked ass.</i>

312
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,796
<i>And then I went
to the Middle East</i>

313
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,600
<i>and... I got my ass kicked.</i>

314
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:31,008
<i>They say... that I
saved a lot of people..</i>

315
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,910
<i>While I was down range.</i>

316
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:38,382
<i>I don't remember it that way.</i>

317
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,617
<i>I remember all the ones
that I lost.</i>

318
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,986
<i>You'll be okay. I got you, okay?</i>

319
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,055
<i>Hang on!</i>

320
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:49,359
Got me to thinkin',
bein' out there

321
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:52,896
all that carnage, body parts.

322
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,835
I did some things that would..

323
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,837
Get you in a lot of trouble.

324
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,708
But after I got back..

325
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:11,882
I, uh, I told Polidori
about them.

326
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,321
I don't know why.

327
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:22,259
Old friend, I guess.

328
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,066
Anyway..

329
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,871
Now here we are.

330
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,056
Hello!

331
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,262
Henry?

332
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,369
Henry?

333
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:57,321
Um, sorry to barge in.

334
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:03,227
Are you a friend of Henry's?

335
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:07,497
Is Henry here?

336
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:12,603
Are you where Henry's been
all this time?

337
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:16,073
Are you from the war?

338
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:24,948
Um, try this on.

339
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:27,784
Henry's easily jealous.

340
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,354
Just..

341
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,593
Yup.

342
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:44,434
So, I am Liz.

343
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:48,639
I'm Henry's... girlfriend

344
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:50,641
for lack of a better word.

345
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,345
Who are you?

346
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,683
I'm Adam.

347
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,690
Are you alright?

348
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,961
- Liz.
- Henry.

349
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,464
What are you doing here?
How... how did you get in?

350
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,199
I still have keys.

351
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:20,103
Right, of course. I just..

352
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,240
Sorry, you sounded so down
on the phone I was worried.

353
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,374
I've been worried
this whole time.

354
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,842
<i>Well, Adam, go to your room!</i>

355
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:28,078
<i>Put clothes on!</i>

356
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,981
<i>Liz, I told you
I needed some time.</i>

357
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:33,917
<i>I gave you time, I thought
you went to the VA Hospital</i>

358
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,186
<i>in Washington to try
the program there.</i>

359
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,455
<i>No, alright? I never left,
I've been here.</i>

360
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,358
<i>Polidori's just letting you
stay here? Why?</i>

361
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,593
<i>I'm not one of your
patients, Liz.</i>

362
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,128
<i>The fact that you won't
acknowledge you have a problem</i>

363
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,663
<i>is part of PTSD, Henry.</i>

364
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:48,899
<i>I don't have PTSD.</i>

365
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:51,501
<i>I've just been focused
on other things.</i>

366
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,303
<i>Anyway, in case you think
I'm stalking you</i>

367
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,138
<i>I'm here because
Polidori invited me.</i>

368
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,007
<i>Has he even told you,
he's been tweeting about</i>

369
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,176
<i>some pet project of yours.
What's he talking about?</i>

370
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:01,712
<i>Jesus! He's a fuckin' idiot!</i>

371
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:03,180
<i>He doesn't know
what he's doing, I told him</i>

372
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:05,082
<i>I need more time.
He can't rush this.</i>

373
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:07,084
<i>Rush what?</i>

374
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:11,054
<i>Are you telling me
you went through with it?</i>

375
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,557
<i>Yes.</i>

376
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,893
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

377
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,763
<i>You did it.</i>

378
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:24,001
<i>You shit!</i>

379
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,771
I'm so sorry I scared you.

380
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:29,473
You must be so..

381
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:31,842
Alone.

382
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,111
<i>Alright, Liz, we have to go now.</i>

383
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:35,979
Goodbye, Adam.

384
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,917
<i>Henry, you brought the war
home with you.</i>

385
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:54,057
<i>I've been away all month,
it's been excruciating.</i>

386
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,560
<i>Like missing the birth
of your own child.</i>

387
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:58,361
<i>How would you know?</i>

388
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,130
<i>Shut up, Georgie.</i>

389
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
<i>Henry's been secretive.</i>

390
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:05,869
<i>I'm pissed.</i>

391
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,404
<i>I think we can all agree
it's astonishing</i>

392
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:08,872
<i>what a couple of years
in the theater of war</i>

393
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,974
<i>can do to a man's
medical prowess.</i>

394
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,110
<i>And his psyche.</i>

395
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:15,312
<i>Well, we were able to get
fatalities down with</i>

396
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:17,948
<i>the mobile triage unit when
we were closer to the action.</i>

397
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,251
<i>Faster response times,
better results.</i>

398
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:22,853
<i>Yeah, but anybody can think
about this stuff.</i>

399
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:24,688
<i>You actually
did something about it.</i>

400
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,724
You got skills.

401
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,359
I mean, shit, man,
you can bring people

402
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:33,797
back from the dead.
And I can keep them alive.

403
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,433
I'm sure the girls don't want to
talk about this stuff, Polidori.

404
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:39,269
Now, it's too late for that.
He won't shut up about it.

405
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:42,472
That's why we're here, right?

406
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:46,843
To bear witness,
while others are out

407
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,613
fucking around
with molecular science..

408
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:54,851
DNA in Petri dishes
or computers.

409
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,655
We're in here
dealing with blood and guts.

410
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,024
The totally tactile.

411
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,160
The extreme sports of biology.

412
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:06,196
<i>Both of you are going to end up
on the front page.</i>

413
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:08,532
You're damn straight we are.

414
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:12,135
And when we do, I've got
a whole speech worked out.

415
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:13,937
Once people see this,
we can put Rap-X

416
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:16,239
on the fast track to market.

417
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:19,209
It's gonna save a lot of lives.

418
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:22,512
It should make some SynTech
stock holders pretty happy.

419
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,648
You and Georgina
should do very well.

420
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:29,186
Either that or you'll drive the
whole company down in scandal.

421
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:32,322
No. This is way too big
for that.

422
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,492
<i>Well, Henry, here we are</i>

423
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:38,862
our witnesses to the unavailing.

424
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,264
Reality check.

425
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:43,867
We've got a lot riding on this.

426
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,468
I've got a lot
of very important people

427
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,070
interested in what we're
doing here.

428
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:49,639
<i>Well, I would really rather be
doing this in private.</i>

429
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:53,677
<i>He's never met more than
one person at a time.</i>

430
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,979
Come on, don't be
such a counter-parent.

431
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:59,182
Adam, how did you..

432
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:04,354
My God! Oh, my God!

433
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:10,360
Well, so, this is it.

434
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:13,330
Or this is Adam.

435
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,200
Adam, how are you?

436
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:19,836
How is he?

437
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,172
He's good, uh, you know,
keepin' him busy

438
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:24,874
with, uh, the Dilantin

439
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,042
<i>the Taxamine, Heparin.</i>

440
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,844
<i>Cyclosporine, Mycophenolate.</i>

441
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:30,413
<i>Just trying to keep
the rejection to a minimum.</i>

442
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,848
<i>Quite a cocktail
and you've been using</i>

443
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,383
<i>the Rap X three times a day?</i>

444
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:34,951
- Three a day.
- And all of him functions?

445
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:37,921
Like he, he eats? He shits?

446
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,155
Yes, yes and yes.

447
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:41,524
And every single
part of him works?

448
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:43,326
What do you mean?

449
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:44,628
You know, cock and balls, Henry.

450
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,863
This guy's got to be raging into
puberty any day now.

451
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,298
You don't want to give him
a complex.

452
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,533
Oh, I'm sure you'll be happy
to counsel him through.

453
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,435
Anything for science.

454
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:56,573
<i>- And can he talk?
- Yes.</i>

455
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:59,242
<i>Uh, talking is something
we've been working on.</i>

456
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:01,378
Isn't that right, Adam?

457
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:10,153
That's right, Henry.

458
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:13,957
And I think we are getting

459
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:18,795
so much better... all the time.

460
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,666
That can't happen again.

461
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:24,834
We're doing this on<i> my</i> schedule.

462
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:26,403
Do you understand?

463
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:28,004
Come on.

464
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,377
- Book.
- No, sleep.

465
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,879
You'll fall asleep.

466
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:41,318
Sleep.

467
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:48,091
<i>I'm taking the girls away.</i>

468
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,826
<i>They're extremely agitated.</i>

469
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,095
<i>Well, you shouldn't have
brought 'em in the first place.</i>

470
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:54,831
<i>Yeah, I'll take 'em in town
for a drink.</i>

471
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,499
<i>You can't buy off Liz.</i>

472
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,601
<i>You can buy off anyone, Henry.</i>

473
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:01,471
<i>Come on, I want to see
Adam again.</i>

474
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:02,872
<i>Bring him out here.</i>

475
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:04,507
<i>I gave him a sedative,
he's all hyped up.</i>

476
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,276
<i>The Rap-X is potent.</i>

477
00:39:06,278 --> 00:39:08,545
<i>The Rap X is working perfectly</i>

478
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:10,780
<i>and it's gonna save
a lot of lives.</i>

479
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:12,682
<i>I mean, that's why
we did this, Henry.</i>

480
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,217
<i>We did it to make up
for everything</i>

481
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,485
<i>that went wrong
on the battlefield.</i>

482
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:17,354
<i>And, yeah, s... sure we did it</i>

483
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,356
<i>to test out a drug
that would otherwise</i>

484
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:20,857
<i>take you years
to get approval on.</i>

485
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,926
<i>But they can't argue
with success.</i>

486
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,160
<i>Yeah.</i>

487
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,995
What the fuck is the matter
with you, man?

488
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,731
Why aren't you ecstatic?

489
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,066
I guess, I..

490
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:33,203
I got so wrapped up
in the challenge of it

491
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,872
I didn't think about him.

492
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,075
The thrill of conception and now

493
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:41,077
you've all of a sudden
lost interest.

494
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,913
Maybe you're not cut out
for fatherhood.

495
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,148
<i>That's not true.</i>

496
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,752
I... I've spent time with him.
We've bonded.

497
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,253
We..

498
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:53,923
Jesus Christ,
I'm fucking with you, man.

499
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:56,693
<i>No, you're,
you're a great daddy.</i>

500
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:59,429
<i>But where do we go from here?
The experiment's over.</i>

501
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:01,064
<i>Dude, what are you talking
about the experiment's over?</i>

502
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,499
The experiment has just begun.

503
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:05,101
Now we have to present him
to the world.

504
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,436
That's the whole point.

505
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:10,039
I'm thinkin' about stoppin'
the medication.

506
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,610
<i>Are you fucking crazy?</i>

507
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,080
<i>Well, excuse me.</i>

508
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,082
You are fucking crazy.

509
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:22,118
No, Henry..

510
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,953
That is not
what we're going to do.

511
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:29,058
- Adam, you should be in bed.
- Adam, it's okay.

512
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,027
Come on in, please.

513
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:32,295
You're welcome.

514
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,832
It's nice to see you again.

515
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:39,302
Oh, I don't think I ever
taught him to shake hands.

516
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:41,204
Alright. Right there.

517
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,773
Okay.. Oh, okay. Okay, yep.

518
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,675
Big strong hands.

519
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:49,579
Alright, that's.. I see
you've got him on hormones.

520
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:52,615
HGH. I wanna see how strong
he can get.

521
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:55,852
You know, with everything
else he's got goin' on.

522
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:58,988
- And?
- See for yourself.

523
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,290
Hm.

524
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,535
You know I think you should
let me take him out for a spin.

525
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,003
Give him some air, some culture.

526
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:17,240
You're always talking about
the importance of the brain.

527
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:18,875
Do you think
we should be filling this one

528
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,877
with something worthwhile?

529
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,195
I want him back by 6:00,
before dark.

530
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:41,664
<i>Look at you. You're so cute.</i>

531
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,899
You're a prick.

532
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:45,735
Maybe so, but you got to
let go sometime.

533
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:48,738
Come on, Adam.
It's gonna be fun.

534
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,841
<i>That looks good on you.</i>

535
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,317
Don't worry.

536
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,454
Come on.

537
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:06,222
Let's take a selfie.

538
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,126
Why so serious? Come on, smile.

539
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:13,229
<i>Welcome to Manhattan, Adam.</i>

540
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:58,908
Okay. Come on.

541
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:03,880
Recognize this place, Adam?

542
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,548
<i>I believe you should.</i>

543
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:12,388
Come on.

544
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,959
<i>And so it begins.</i>

545
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:18,194
<i>I don't suppose Henry's
had the time to teach you</i>

546
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:20,663
<i>the history of things
but allow me to summarize.</i>

547
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:23,833
<i>Since the beginning
it's been war and warring</i>

548
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:27,437
<i>with factions of artists trying
to find beauty and meaning.</i>

549
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:29,973
Capture the agony
and the ecstasy.

550
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:34,143
This museum, it's a mausoleum

551
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:36,446
<i>to the aspirations of man.</i>

552
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:41,184
Nice aspirations on him,
don't you think, Adam?

553
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:46,189
<i>"The Divine Comedy."</i>

554
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:49,325
<i>Should Ugolino
have eaten his offspring?</i>

555
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,828
<i>It's all about choices.</i>

556
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,363
<i>Some would say
choice is an illusion.</i>

557
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:56,132
<i>I prefer to give it some credit.</i>

558
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:59,969
<i>The choices we make
define the man.</i>

559
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,076
Come on.

560
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:16,085
The Rape of the Sabine Women.

561
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:18,021
I thought you'd like
this one, Adam.

562
00:44:18,023 --> 00:44:20,323
<i>Filled with an action.</i>

563
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,592
<i>Those women were tricked</i>

564
00:44:22,594 --> 00:44:25,228
<i>and can't be trusted.</i>

565
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,796
Terrible.

566
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:31,434
<i>Principles, justice, honor.</i>

567
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:32,802
Some would die for them.

568
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:36,139
While others
are a bit more shrewd.

569
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:39,142
<i>This, this is what
they teach you</i>

570
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:41,477
<i>in the institutes
of higher learning, Adam.</i>

571
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:43,312
<i>A lot of useless knowledge</i>

572
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:46,382
that nobody gives
a fuck about anymore.

573
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:50,186
I did meet my darling wife
in college.

574
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:53,356
Don't get me wrong,
there are some perks.

575
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,491
She was very rich.

576
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:58,428
C... cloud.

577
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:01,264
Hm... yes, it is.

578
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,701
<i>How do you see the world, Adam?</i>

579
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:07,704
<i>Do you see great swirls
like Van Gogh?</i>

580
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,640
<i>He died in poverty.</i>

581
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:13,209
He went mad
and cut his own ear off.

582
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:21,617
Modernity encroaches.

583
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,619
20th century angst.

584
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:27,123
<i>God is dead
and we are left alone</i>

585
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:30,693
<i>with our technology
and our nightmares.</i>

586
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:33,696
<i>It is the beginning of the end.</i>

587
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:37,300
<i>A culture of narcissism
and self indulgence</i>

588
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:41,137
born out of the comforts
of modern life.

589
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:45,374
<i>All that's left to do
is enjoy the ride.</i>

590
00:45:50,482 --> 00:45:53,816
<i>This is my favorite place
in the museum.</i>

591
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:58,554
<i>Here we have artistry
and science</i>

592
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:00,456
<i>directly engaged</i>

593
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:03,259
<i>with man's essential impulse..</i>

594
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,728
<i>Violence.</i>

595
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,697
<i>These are instruments of death.</i>

596
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:10,900
<i>Look how lovingly crafted.</i>

597
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:13,536
<i>From the blade to the balm</i>

598
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:17,006
<i>humanity does so love
destruction.</i>

599
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,176
Depraved.

600
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:24,847
That's what we are, Adam.
Utterly depraved.

601
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:36,459
<i>Souvenir of our visit.</i>

602
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:40,229
You always have to have
a souvenir, Adam.

603
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:42,532
Speaking of memories, does, um

604
00:46:42,534 --> 00:46:45,301
anything here look familiar?

605
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:50,740
Have you worked here long?

606
00:46:50,742 --> 00:46:52,942
Um, for a while, yeah.

607
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:56,246
Thanks.

608
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,781
Thank you.

609
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:12,161
<i>Come on, Adam.
It's not polite to stare.</i>

610
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:46,796
Hi, ladies.

611
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:48,965
Melania.

612
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:52,802
Ermez.

613
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:54,470
Hi, baby.

614
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:07,850
Get us two whiskeys.

615
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:16,058
Come on, Adam.

616
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:19,862
This is my friend, Adam.

617
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:21,898
Adam, this is the lovely Stormi.

618
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:26,869
Thank you, my love.

619
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:28,137
<i>Salut.</i>

620
00:48:32,844 --> 00:48:35,378
Don't worry, it gets better
with the second one.

621
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,321
<i>You like her?</i>

622
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,429
You do like her, don't you?

623
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:59,869
<i>Do you know any girls, Adam?</i>

624
00:48:59,871 --> 00:49:01,304
I know Liz.

625
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:05,541
You do know Liz.
Let's get closer.

626
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:19,455
Give those to her.

627
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:08,671
Mm-hm.

628
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:15,144
We're gonna spend a lot more
time together, you and I, Adam.

629
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:20,716
Henry's not well.

630
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:24,387
There is one thing
I want you to promise me.

631
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:27,556
If he ever stops giving you
your medication

632
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:29,592
you know,
the... the... the Rap-X?

633
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:31,560
It's the little red pills?

634
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:35,564
You find them and you take them.

635
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:37,833
Three tablets a day
and you never stop.

636
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:39,435
Do you understand?

637
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:42,538
Good.

638
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,707
He may not care about you..

639
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:47,243
But I do.

640
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:55,985
That's the funny thing
about fathers.

641
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:00,556
So few of 'em are in it
for the long haul.

642
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:14,136
<i>Do you know what a lie is, Adam?</i>

643
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:19,241
<i>A lie is something
that's spoken that is not true.</i>

644
00:51:20,812 --> 00:51:23,079
<i>A lie can hurt
as much as a knife wound</i>

645
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:26,582
<i>if it's wielded with as much
care and purpose.</i>

646
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,087
Sometimes it's those
who are closest to us who lie.

647
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:41,964
You like her.

648
00:52:00,585 --> 00:52:02,384
Good morning, Henry.

649
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:05,354
Come on, Adam.

650
00:52:05,356 --> 00:52:06,422
Attaboy.

651
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:08,057
Where the hell were you?

652
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:10,726
We were out on the town.

653
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:13,596
All night? Never again.

654
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:15,197
You know, I must've been out
of my fuckin' mind.

655
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:18,167
Yeah, sometimes I think
you might be.

656
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:20,836
- What did you give him?
- Ah, don't worry about it.

657
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:22,271
He'll sweat it out.

658
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:24,740
Don't be such a fuckin' Puritan.

659
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:26,809
I called you seven times.

660
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:30,613
Yeah, well now you know
what it feels like.

661
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:34,049
- This isn't a fuckin' game!
- No, I understand that.

662
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:37,586
Hey, listen I... I... I
just wanna tell you something

663
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:39,455
because he's your patient.

664
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:42,124
What, what?
What do you wanna say?

665
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:43,759
Well, it's just, uh..

666
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:47,563
I think he might be
a little volatile.

667
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:50,733
Some of his behavior
was slightly erratic.

668
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:52,168
Yeah, he's probably reacting

669
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,270
to whatever the fuck
you put him through.

670
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:56,539
You and your whole scene, man,
just lookin' for excitement.

671
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:59,141
You don't know the first
fuckin' thing about excitement.

672
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:03,979
Look, he said something
about Liz..

673
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:07,216
So I figured maybe you
should keep an eye out.

674
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:09,318
- What?
- Nothing.

675
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,553
Nothing, it was just the fact

676
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:11,987
that it came
so fucking out of the blue.

677
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:13,522
I thought you should know.

678
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:17,393
Ask him. Look, I got to go.

679
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:40,849
Come on, let's go inside.

680
00:53:57,602 --> 00:54:00,402
Hello.

681
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:03,706
It's me, Liz.

682
00:54:04,508 --> 00:54:06,175
I remember.

683
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:10,379
I'm Adam.

684
00:54:11,983 --> 00:54:14,450
Um, did I wake you?

685
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:22,224
Um, I wanted to know..

686
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:26,862
How you... feel.

687
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:29,365
Feel?

688
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:33,235
I..

689
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:37,039
I feel with my hand.

690
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:42,845
Buttons.

691
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:45,247
Oh, mm.

692
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:51,920
I, uh..

693
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:56,358
I was wondering..

694
00:54:57,828 --> 00:55:01,830
Is any... body asking you..

695
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:08,671
Do you have any..

696
00:55:14,378 --> 00:55:16,045
Pain?

697
00:55:17,782 --> 00:55:19,181
Pain?

698
00:55:22,053 --> 00:55:23,619
Pain.

699
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,623
Yes.

700
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,727
I have pain.

701
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,635
Oh.

702
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:47,810
What do you do here all day
when Henry's not around?

703
00:55:47,812 --> 00:55:50,279
<i>I read books.</i>

704
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:53,649
<i>I wait for Henry to come
and play ping pong with me.</i>

705
00:55:55,319 --> 00:56:00,622
In my... dreams,
um I'm someone else.

706
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:04,593
<i>I don't understand
how I got here.</i>

707
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:06,395
<i>What's goin' on here?</i>

708
00:56:07,431 --> 00:56:09,565
Henry.

709
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:12,701
<i>Liz, you can't just keep
barging in here.</i>

710
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,371
Well, he was all alone.

711
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:18,774
You're not gonna fix him.
You're not gonna fix me.

712
00:56:20,244 --> 00:56:23,445
Jesus Christ, Henry,
what a fucking mess you've made.

713
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:26,615
<i>Don't talk to me like that.
What I've done here is amazing.</i>

714
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:28,784
Oh, really?

715
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:31,053
And who can you tell about
this spectacular accomplishment

716
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:32,321
<i>without being thrown in jail?</i>

717
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:33,355
Fuck that!

718
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:34,390
You don't think that they would

719
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:36,759
fall all over themselves
to protect me

720
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:38,160
<i>after they found out
what I've done?</i>

721
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:41,797
They? They, they.
Who the fuck is they?

722
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:43,432
Who can you even trust
with this?

723
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:44,933
My God, shut up.
Shut the fuck...

724
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,235
Can you repeat what you've done?

725
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:48,303
- What?
- Is it verifiable?

726
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:50,272
<i>- It's in the computer.
- Would anybody even let you?</i>

727
00:56:50,274 --> 00:56:52,674
- Stop!
- Henry, you are not well.

728
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:54,443
Ever since I've met you

729
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:57,179
you have been trying to save
everyone that you meet

730
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:58,647
but you know what?

731
00:56:58,649 --> 00:57:02,217
Therapy and kindness
can't fix everything. Alright?

732
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:04,353
<i>You get your fuckin' leg
blown off</i>

733
00:57:04,355 --> 00:57:07,356
<i>you need more than
a bedside manner to fix it!</i>

734
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:08,924
<i>It takes innovation.</i>

735
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:11,126
Blood and guts, innovation.

736
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:14,263
This is not you talking. This
is Polidori manipulating you.

737
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:17,332
Stop! You have always been
jealous of him, it's ridiculous.

738
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:20,202
Jealous? Jealous that he can get
you to do anything he wants.

739
00:57:20,204 --> 00:57:23,839
What about me, huh?
What about what I have done?

740
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:25,107
<i>What I have achieved?</i>

741
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:27,609
I see nothing here but sadness.

742
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:31,313
<i>Don't, don't say that
in front of Adam.</i>

743
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:35,951
Henry, please.
Please, just come to the clinic.

744
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,319
There are so many vets
down there

745
00:57:37,321 --> 00:57:40,355
who could use
your compassion, your smarts.

746
00:57:40,357 --> 00:57:42,458
Yes, of course. I want to but..

747
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:45,661
If you think that Polidori
cares about you

748
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:49,798
<i>or about Adam or anybody
but himself, you're wrong.</i>

749
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,268
<i>Get out now, please.
This isn't needed here.</i>

750
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:24,533
I've been wrong.

751
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:27,836
I realize that..

752
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:34,009
I owe you something
like a normal life..

753
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:36,945
Where you can come and go.

754
00:58:40,818 --> 00:58:42,484
I didn't think it through.

755
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:47,389
I didn't believe
that you would ever..

756
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:51,727
Understand
what was happening to you.

757
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:55,297
Maybe I didn't want to.

758
00:58:55,299 --> 00:58:57,966
I want a girl
like you have a girl.

759
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:02,137
- What?
- Lonely.

760
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:07,576
Right, of course.

761
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:10,646
I understand.

762
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:15,551
Is that what you and Liz
were talkin' about?

763
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:19,555
No.

764
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:22,858
You don't have to lie to me,
Adam.

765
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,626
I know that she's..

766
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:27,963
She's very kind.

767
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:32,067
Lie.

768
00:59:35,172 --> 00:59:36,505
<i>It's only a matter of time</i>

769
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:38,340
<i>till we all have to start
getting ready</i>

770
00:59:38,342 --> 00:59:39,374
<i>for doomsday, you know?</i>

771
00:59:39,376 --> 00:59:41,443
<i>Even if it's trans-misogyny</i>

772
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,011
<i>the qualifications require..</i>

773
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:46,682
<i>Valentine's Day may be over</i>

774
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:49,117
<i>but you can always
give a smoochy cake..</i>

775
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,852
<i>Northern and Southern California</i>

776
00:59:50,854 --> 00:59:52,854
<i>still dealing
with the, the fire storms.</i>

777
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:55,157
<i>I'm opposed
to shutting down your speech.</i>

778
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:57,125
<i>You know you have to have
that objection..</i>

779
00:59:57,127 --> 01:00:00,228
<i>It's not the solution,
the government is the problem.</i>

780
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,530
<i>Now in this..</i>

781
01:00:01,532 --> 01:00:04,399
<i>Can Bill and Margo win
the $10,000?</i>

782
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:06,868
<i>Ask your doctor
if Doraphine is right for you.</i>

783
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:10,072
<i>Side effects include bleeding,
nausea and in some patients.</i>

784
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:13,175
<i>Doraphine has been known to
cause heart failure and death.</i>

785
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:15,177
<i>Discontinue use..</i>

786
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:11,199
Drugs.

787
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:14,036
Medicine.

788
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:18,440
Don't need 'em.

789
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:21,743
We don't need them... anymore.

790
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:25,013
You, uh... you got better.

791
01:01:28,419 --> 01:01:30,385
Red pills.

792
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:32,187
Three a day.

793
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:36,158
Nope.

794
01:01:38,062 --> 01:01:39,761
You're good.

795
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:49,371
Adam, I wanna give you
somethin'.

796
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:08,890
I want you to have this.

797
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:15,497
And I want you to know..

798
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:17,699
That charm..

799
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:19,701
That means this was a gift.

800
01:02:22,106 --> 01:02:24,139
That means you were loved.

801
01:02:58,075 --> 01:03:01,143
Hit the ball to you,
hit it with the paddle.

802
01:03:01,145 --> 01:03:02,511
Okay?

803
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:08,183
Okay, let's see if this works.

804
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:09,551
Okay.

805
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,630
Open the goddamn door.

806
01:03:55,632 --> 01:03:56,965
Where did you get him?

807
01:03:56,967 --> 01:03:59,367
Paramedic buddy of mine in Dumbo

808
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:01,603
gave me a call,
knew I was looking.

809
01:04:02,773 --> 01:04:05,640
God, it's still warm.
How did you do that?

810
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:08,443
Henry? Door.

811
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:11,947
<i>Time of death, 10:48.</i>

812
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:13,648
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

813
01:04:16,053 --> 01:04:17,719
<i>I'm gonna start prepping
the instruments.</i>

814
01:04:17,721 --> 01:04:19,955
<i>We got to get that brain
outta there, alright?</i>

815
01:04:43,947 --> 01:04:45,347
<i>Henry?</i>

816
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:47,382
<i>Okay, stay there.
Stay there, alright?</i>

817
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:55,590
Alright, stay there.
And my best friend.

818
01:04:56,894 --> 01:04:58,226
This guy.

819
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:01,263
Okay.

820
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,473
<i>Hello?</i>

821
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:14,376
<i>Alex?</i>

822
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:17,045
<i>Alex?</i>

823
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:20,515
<i>Who is this?</i>

824
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:22,017
<i>Oh, my God, who is this?</i>

825
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:23,718
No!

826
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:33,461
<i>Whoa! Whoa-oh!</i>

827
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:36,798
- Speak of the devil!
- Adam, stand back.

828
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,234
Okay, Henry, in... introduce
your friend to the guys.

829
01:05:39,236 --> 01:05:41,603
This is proof that Rap-X works.

830
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:42,904
Adam..

831
01:05:43,874 --> 01:05:47,575
- I know what you did.
- What?

832
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:49,177
- And you!
- Okay, come on!

833
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:51,246
Come on, come on!

834
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:52,380
<i>Adam!</i>

835
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:13,935
<i>Adam!</i>

836
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:21,242
<i>Adam!</i>

837
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,088
Guys, I'm so glad
you could come.

838
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:35,924
Look, the one thing I need you
to understand about all of this

839
01:06:35,926 --> 01:06:37,625
is that,
is that it's an anomaly.

840
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:40,695
This was not a situation
that has happened before.

841
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:44,632
I'm sure you understand
that in the course

842
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:46,701
of a clinical trial
every so often you hit a...

843
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:48,503
Look, I don't know what the hell
happened back there

844
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:51,206
but you're crazy
if you think it's ready.

845
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:54,909
Okay, guys, look, I'll,
I'll give you a call next..

846
01:07:02,452 --> 01:07:03,952
<i>Well?</i>

847
01:07:03,954 --> 01:07:07,222
I couldn't find him but he,
he can't have gotten far.

848
01:07:08,091 --> 01:07:09,190
Fuck!

849
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,827
<i>Henry, I am sorry, I've got
too much riding on this.</i>

850
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:14,195
<i>I cannot let you fuck it up.</i>

851
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,531
<i>Do you ever get tired
of stating the obvious</i>

852
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:19,034
<i>you asshole?
It's all ready fucked up!</i>

853
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:21,736
<i>No, no, in fact the only thing
that's gone wrong so far</i>

854
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:23,805
<i>is that you've introduced
unnecessary drama</i>

855
01:07:23,807 --> 01:07:25,907
into this situation.

856
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:28,076
Look, you haven't been firm
with Adam

857
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:31,379
and that has made him feel
unsafe and uncomfortable.

858
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:35,183
You don't know the first fuckin'
thing about what Adam needs.

859
01:07:35,185 --> 01:07:37,352
He needs calm and stability.

860
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:40,555
The brain cannot heal itself
in an erratic environment.

861
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:44,325
Okay, okay. Well you know
what I fucking need, Henry?

862
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:48,063
I need this thing to start
paying off... now.

863
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:50,698
This is a trial period still.

864
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,567
- No!
- You need to accept that.

865
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:56,905
No! It's not, Henry!
It's not a trial period.

866
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:59,641
It has been 30 goddamn days.

867
01:07:59,643 --> 01:08:03,778
The trial
is a rousing success, man.

868
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:07,282
It worked. Congratulations.

869
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,752
Look, I got to go.

870
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:14,522
Just so you know,
I... I... I took

871
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:16,291
the laptop and the hard drives.

872
01:08:16,293 --> 01:08:17,826
What?

873
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:20,562
John, you can't just do that.

874
01:08:20,564 --> 01:08:23,198
I'm sure you remember
the agreement we made

875
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,532
where this is all my property.

876
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:28,136
Come on, man, don't turn
this whole fuckin' experience

877
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:30,872
into just some thing you did
for SynTech.

878
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:33,541
Oh.

879
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:35,710
Fuck you.

880
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:38,813
Look, I... I was there, man.
I was in the room.

881
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:40,415
You needed my help.

882
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:43,051
You didn't do this without me.
You couldn't do this without me.

883
01:08:43,053 --> 01:08:47,055
Yes, yes, John.
We did this together.

884
01:08:47,057 --> 01:08:50,758
Look just call me
if Adam shows back up.

885
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,161
Okay?

886
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:55,930
I... I got to go, uh..

887
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:58,867
Sort shit out with the suits.

888
01:08:58,869 --> 01:09:01,102
And I got to be upstate
for the weekend but after that...

889
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:05,507
- Adam is not ready.
- Look, Adam's not even here.

890
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:06,741
Look, I'll be back on Monday.

891
01:09:06,743 --> 01:09:09,777
He better fucking be back
before then.

892
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:11,045
John.

893
01:09:12,249 --> 01:09:14,015
John!

894
01:09:15,886 --> 01:09:17,218
John!

895
01:09:33,603 --> 01:09:36,404
Liz, it's me. I..

896
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:38,773
Adam's gone missing.
I'm out looking for him.

897
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:41,743
But... if he goes back
to the loft

898
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:44,379
could you just be there?

899
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:46,347
I'm... I'm sorry.

900
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:48,216
Just call me.

901
01:11:27,217 --> 01:11:30,852
<i>Hey, bud?
You havin' a drink or what?</i>

902
01:11:30,854 --> 01:11:32,253
Whiskey.

903
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,890
<i>Top shelf, house, rocks?</i>

904
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:38,026
Yes.

905
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,168
<i>Eight bucks.</i>

906
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:15,797
<i>Hey, Sam, I'll get the next one.</i>

907
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,269
Hi.

908
01:12:25,342 --> 01:12:27,275
You fucked up?

909
01:12:27,277 --> 01:12:29,377
You look fucked up.

910
01:12:29,379 --> 01:12:30,745
But I wanted to buy you
a whiskey 'cause when you

911
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:33,181
walked in here
you reminded me of Iggy Pop.

912
01:12:34,751 --> 01:12:37,051
You know who Iggy Pop is?

913
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:39,454
Because that's the shit, man.

914
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,657
Here, you gonna drink this?

915
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:45,126
Come on, toast.

916
01:12:46,429 --> 01:12:48,896
Raise your glass, man.

917
01:12:56,506 --> 01:12:58,206
I'm Shelley.

918
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:01,008
- What's your name?
- Iggy.

919
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:08,716
Just so you know I've done every
puzzle in this place already

920
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:11,953
so... don't try
any funny business.

921
01:13:21,131 --> 01:13:23,197
So what happened to you?

922
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,566
I mean, Iggy,
those are a lot of scars.

923
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,735
Is that your real name?

924
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,637
I like music.

925
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:33,975
Cool. I do too.

926
01:13:33,977 --> 01:13:35,343
What kinda music you into?

927
01:13:35,345 --> 01:13:37,278
Do you like "The Stooges?"

928
01:13:39,349 --> 01:13:41,783
Gravity is your friend.

929
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,086
Yeah.

930
01:13:47,991 --> 01:13:49,991
Never thought about it
like that.

931
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:53,461
So you gonna tell me
what happened to you?

932
01:13:53,463 --> 01:13:55,663
You don't have to answer that
but I really want you to.

933
01:13:55,665 --> 01:13:57,932
You have a tattoo.
I have a tattoo.

934
01:13:57,934 --> 01:13:59,734
Oh, yeah? Yeah,
I've got a lot of tattoos.

935
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:01,402
But you're not gonna
see 'em all tonight.

936
01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:03,104
I have this tattoo.

937
01:14:04,574 --> 01:14:06,441
Wow.

938
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:10,111
Wait, what is that?
That's, um, Caduceus, right?

939
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,280
- It means like rebirth?
- I don't know.

940
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:15,216
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

941
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:16,818
Oh, come on, you don't know
what it means?

942
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:19,287
- No.
- Oh.

943
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:22,190
I've had nights like that too.

944
01:14:22,192 --> 01:14:24,525
Thank God, I never got
a tattoo though.

945
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:29,797
But what about the scars, Iggy?

946
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,399
Are you into like scarring
and shit?

947
01:14:31,401 --> 01:14:33,768
I mean, that's some crazy shit.

948
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:41,375
Okay, what do you say,
one more round?

949
01:15:16,913 --> 01:15:18,479
Alright, that's it, I'm broke.

950
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:21,048
Sam's so cheap.

951
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:23,584
He won't give me a free one
unless I'm here the whole night.

952
01:15:23,586 --> 01:15:25,653
Did you just..

953
01:15:25,655 --> 01:15:27,555
So you're good at puzzles.

954
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:34,695
And you're pretty quiet.

955
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,163
You're pretty weird.

956
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:39,166
What are you even doing
around here?

957
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:42,937
I walked here.

958
01:15:44,274 --> 01:15:46,040
Yeah? You live around here?

959
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:48,209
I mean, I've never seen you
before, I'd remember.

960
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,378
I don't go outside,
I stay inside.

961
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,980
Mm, hm, no wonder,
I mean, you're so pale.

962
01:15:52,982 --> 01:15:56,450
I mean... what are you,
like a vampire or something?

963
01:15:56,452 --> 01:15:57,752
I don't know.

964
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:01,322
Oh, well, that probably means
you are one.

965
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:07,995
Shit.
It's getting pretty late, huh?

966
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:09,397
I got to work tomorrow.

967
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:13,134
Fuckin' corporate slog.

968
01:16:13,136 --> 01:16:15,036
I know you wouldn't guess it
by looking at me, huh?

969
01:16:15,038 --> 01:16:17,572
But, yeah, just a cog in the
wheel. What are you gonna do?

970
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:20,107
Problem is,
I can't ever sleep at night

971
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:21,876
so I got to come here every night
and slam a couple.

972
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:24,478
- You know what I mean?
- Yep.

973
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,081
Wow, you are pretty funny.
What do you do?

974
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:31,085
Play ping-pong.

975
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:37,325
You're drunk.

976
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:40,061
Or... you're just nuts.

977
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:42,463
I don't know,
but I'm pretty drunk.

978
01:16:42,465 --> 01:16:44,065
Ooh, yeah, I got to go.

979
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:45,266
You gonna stay?

980
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:47,535
I have nowhere to go.

981
01:16:47,537 --> 01:16:49,203
What? I thought you said
you lived around here.

982
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:50,338
<i>No.</i>

983
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,006
Huh.

984
01:16:53,343 --> 01:16:54,709
Well, I guess
you can walk me home.

985
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:57,111
I did buy you all those drinks.

986
01:16:58,514 --> 01:17:00,214
Whoo, it's so cold!

987
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:05,686
I live this way a lotta blocks.

988
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:09,490
Man... you are really out there.

989
01:17:09,492 --> 01:17:12,360
- Are you high?
- I like you.

990
01:17:13,396 --> 01:17:14,795
Yeah?

991
01:17:15,565 --> 01:17:17,732
That's cute, I guess.

992
01:17:17,734 --> 01:17:19,834
You can walk me home, I guess.

993
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,806
You wanna hold my hand?

994
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:28,309
Weird.

995
01:17:32,615 --> 01:17:34,215
I can't believe it rained
and then now

996
01:17:34,217 --> 01:17:36,584
it's just freezing cold
and there's no snow.

997
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:39,987
Rain's only worth rain
if it's gonna turn into snow

998
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,589
you know what I mean?

999
01:17:41,591 --> 01:17:43,624
Anyway, this is me.
Thanks for walkin' me.

1000
01:17:43,626 --> 01:17:47,028
- Uh, come this way.
- You live down there?

1001
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:49,630
I thought it was just a bunch
of warehouses down there.

1002
01:17:49,632 --> 01:17:50,831
Anyway, I can't,
I got to go home.

1003
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:53,267
- Come, ping pong.
- Oh, yeah, ping pong.

1004
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:54,502
- Not tonight. I got to go home.
- No, come!

1005
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:55,803
- Meet Henry.
- Hey!

1006
01:17:55,805 --> 01:17:57,405
Hey, Iggy, what are you doing?
Or whatever your name..

1007
01:17:57,407 --> 01:17:59,440
- Come! Come!
- What are you doing?

1008
01:18:01,611 --> 01:18:03,010
Come on!

1009
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:06,380
Please! Let me go! Please!

1010
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:43,217
Adam?

1011
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:45,820
Adam?

1012
01:18:45,822 --> 01:18:48,622
Adam, oh, my God,
what did you do?

1013
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,326
Come on,
we have to get her upstairs.

1014
01:18:52,328 --> 01:18:54,628
Up... upstairs now!

1015
01:18:57,967 --> 01:18:59,500
Hold her. Come on.

1016
01:19:02,839 --> 01:19:04,271
Lay her out!

1017
01:19:10,747 --> 01:19:12,113
Shelley?

1018
01:19:12,515 --> 01:19:13,981
Shelley?

1019
01:19:20,857 --> 01:19:22,556
No, no. It's... it's too late.

1020
01:19:22,558 --> 01:19:26,360
I want her to be my girl.
Give her medicine.

1021
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:29,463
- Did you do this?
- Shelley, my girl!

1022
01:19:29,465 --> 01:19:32,433
No, No!
Don't you fucking get it?

1023
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,835
She's been dead for hours.
I.. It doesn't work.

1024
01:19:34,837 --> 01:19:37,271
Medicine!
Bring her back like me!

1025
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:38,939
- No, I can't! It's too late.
- Shelley!

1026
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:41,809
I know you can fix her!

1027
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:11,172
You know what's happening?

1028
01:20:11,174 --> 01:20:12,807
You don't really exist.

1029
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:15,309
There's no record of you.
There's no prints.

1030
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,645
You're nothing that can be
traced to anything.

1031
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:19,113
You understand me?

1032
01:20:19,115 --> 01:20:21,148
You're not in the system.

1033
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,683
You're not real.

1034
01:20:24,287 --> 01:20:27,087
I'm sorry. It's over.

1035
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:40,835
We can tomorrow. We still got
tomorrow. We got tomorrow.

1036
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:42,136
<i>We got tomorrow.</i>

1037
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:05,793
Shoot!

1038
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:28,048
You're gonna be okay, alright?
I brought you back.

1039
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:31,485
- What's your name?
- Adam.

1040
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:33,020
Alright, Adam.
You're gonna be okay.

1041
01:21:33,022 --> 01:21:35,789
I got you, okay? Hang on.

1042
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:46,567
Come on!

1043
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:00,147
<i>Oh, God, Henry, what's happened?</i>

1044
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:02,416
<i>I just got your messages.</i>

1045
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,684
I got to get outta here.

1046
01:22:03,686 --> 01:22:05,352
Oh, my God.

1047
01:22:05,354 --> 01:22:07,121
What have you done to Adam?

1048
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:11,992
- Who is she?
- I... I... I... don't know.

1049
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:14,828
I don't know where he went
or who he talked to or

1050
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:17,364
or, or if anyone's gonna be
looking for her.

1051
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:19,667
I'm gonna bury him
in Polidori's backyard.

1052
01:22:19,669 --> 01:22:21,969
Then he and Adam can be
together. Just how he wants it.

1053
01:22:21,971 --> 01:22:24,204
Wow, what a fucking mess
you've made.

1054
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:30,077
<i>Why didn't I remember?</i>

1055
01:22:31,681 --> 01:22:32,681
<i>Remember what?</i>

1056
01:22:33,683 --> 01:22:38,085
<i>Why don't I remember
being small?</i>

1057
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:49,263
<i>Well, you had a trauma.</i>

1058
01:22:52,101 --> 01:22:53,667
<i>That's what we're dealin' with.</i>

1059
01:23:05,181 --> 01:23:10,050
<i>I'm gonna drive north
and I'll call you when I can.</i>

1060
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:13,020
<i>Shit. You... you... you can't
drive, you can't even stand.</i>

1061
01:23:13,022 --> 01:23:17,958
<i>No! I will drive. I will drive.
You get in the car.</i>

1062
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20,294
<i>Drop me off at the train
and then you're on your own.</i>

1063
01:23:24,266 --> 01:23:25,733
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1064
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:32,940
<i>When you're in the field,
every kid that comes in</i>

1065
01:23:32,942 --> 01:23:36,643
<i>with his arm blown off
or his head smashed in</i>

1066
01:23:36,645 --> 01:23:40,447
<i>you want to help him.
Give him an arm and a new leg.</i>

1067
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:43,851
<i>You wish you could bring them
all back</i>

1068
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:45,285
<i>and send them home
to their wives.</i>

1069
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:47,821
<i>Their... their moms, their kids.</i>

1070
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:49,790
<i>Well, I figured it out.</i>

1071
01:23:49,792 --> 01:23:54,261
<i>I figured out how
to bring them back.</i>

1072
01:23:54,263 --> 01:23:56,063
Adam.

1073
01:24:02,805 --> 01:24:05,339
<i>I told Polidori what I'd been
doing in the battlefield</i>

1074
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:07,941
<i>and he got very excited
and he set me up in a loft.</i>

1075
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:10,611
<i>He told me people
from SynTech would support me.</i>

1076
01:24:10,613 --> 01:24:12,513
<i>He could supply
the pharmaceuticals</i>

1077
01:24:12,515 --> 01:24:15,949
<i>if I incorporated the Rap-X.</i>

1078
01:24:15,951 --> 01:24:18,285
<i>He said he could supply
the body parts too</i>

1079
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:21,121
<i>donated to Sanford Medical
and I figured that</i>

1080
01:24:21,123 --> 01:24:23,557
<i>that was probably legit
'cause he's been on staff there</i>

1081
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:27,161
<i>for years, you know?
But I... I didn't care.</i>

1082
01:24:27,163 --> 01:24:29,096
<i>I wanted the body parts.</i>

1083
01:24:41,477 --> 01:24:44,445
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

1084
01:24:44,447 --> 01:24:45,979
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1085
01:24:50,486 --> 01:24:52,453
- What the fuck is that?
- Just dump it.

1086
01:24:52,455 --> 01:24:56,790
I feel sick,
thinking about that girl.

1087
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>Her parents and her friends</i>
<i>wondering what happened to her.</i>

1088
01:25:07,103 --> 01:25:09,169
<i>Wait there! I'll bring it.</i>

1089
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:30,557
Alright, that's it.

1090
01:25:32,094 --> 01:25:34,361
It's about a half mile up
to the house.

1091
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:39,066
<i>If he ever fucks with me..</i>

1092
01:25:40,503 --> 01:25:42,369
I'll just tell him
to take a look down here.

1093
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:03,557
It's a good piece of meat.

1094
01:26:03,559 --> 01:26:06,827
Is it dry? Might be a bit dry.

1095
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:10,631
Hm. No, mine is fantastic.

1096
01:26:10,633 --> 01:26:12,833
How 'bout yours, Mr. Beaufort?
How was it?

1097
01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:16,136
It was fine, John.
Maybe a bit overcooked.

1098
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:25,445
So, I hear tell
that we're thinking

1099
01:26:25,447 --> 01:26:28,081
about raising the price
of Doraphine.

1100
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:29,149
We're looking into it.

1101
01:26:29,151 --> 01:26:30,751
It was severely under priced

1102
01:26:30,753 --> 01:26:31,885
when we introduced it.

1103
01:26:31,887 --> 01:26:34,087
<i>It's a proportionate adjustment.</i>

1104
01:26:34,089 --> 01:26:35,522
<i>Shouldn't cause much of a stir.</i>

1105
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:38,192
No, it shouldn't,
it's, it's astonishing

1106
01:26:38,194 --> 01:26:40,427
how people think
that R and D is free.

1107
01:26:41,897 --> 01:26:44,831
Hm, that's why
I've been doing so much of my

1108
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:47,734
my own due diligence on Rap X.

1109
01:26:47,736 --> 01:26:50,771
Your preoccupation with Rap X
is misplaced.

1110
01:26:50,773 --> 01:26:54,107
<i>It's a long way from market
and the application is obscure.</i>

1111
01:26:54,109 --> 01:26:56,243
<i>I'd like to see you
put your focus elsewhere.</i>

1112
01:26:59,081 --> 01:27:01,215
Sure, but that... that
could change

1113
01:27:01,217 --> 01:27:04,685
with the right data. Correct?

1114
01:27:04,687 --> 01:27:05,919
Dad, you're not here to just

1115
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:08,555
go on about SynTech business
over dinner.

1116
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:10,557
John brought it up.

1117
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,226
<i>Uh, we should put coffee on
if we're going to do</i>

1118
01:27:12,228 --> 01:27:14,094
<i>the drive back
to the city after dinner.</i>

1119
01:27:14,096 --> 01:27:15,929
Oh, well, let me get dessert.

1120
01:27:15,931 --> 01:27:18,065
- Uh, no need for dessert, dear.
- Oh, no, I got it...

1121
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:20,767
Uh, uh, just coffee
and we'll be fine.

1122
01:27:20,769 --> 01:27:22,302
Are you sure you won't spend
the night, mother?

1123
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:24,471
It'll be much more pleasant.

1124
01:27:24,473 --> 01:27:26,173
Yes, we'll have brandy.

1125
01:27:28,244 --> 01:27:30,043
How fast can you pour, John?

1126
01:27:30,045 --> 01:27:31,478
Coming right up.

1127
01:27:37,353 --> 01:27:38,585
Who is that?

1128
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:40,954
<i>Having company at this hour?</i>

1129
01:27:45,361 --> 01:27:47,594
I don't know who that could be.

1130
01:27:48,731 --> 01:27:53,333
Henry. Liz.
What are you doing here?

1131
01:27:53,335 --> 01:27:55,202
Hey.
Hope we're not interrupting.

1132
01:27:55,204 --> 01:27:57,838
Henry. Liz. This is a surprise.

1133
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,406
Well, we were
in the neighborhood.

1134
01:27:59,408 --> 01:28:01,208
Apparently.
You must be freezing.

1135
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:03,944
- Who is it?
- Uh, daddy, you remember Henry.

1136
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:07,547
- We went to school together.
- Yes, Henry. I remember.

1137
01:28:07,549 --> 01:28:10,884
You went to the Mid East didn't
you? Triage, couple of medals?

1138
01:28:10,886 --> 01:28:13,820
- Yes.
- It's a damn mess over there.

1139
01:28:13,822 --> 01:28:16,123
- Yes, sir, it is.
- And not getting any better.

1140
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:20,694
Let's not start, daddy. Come
inside. You too, Liz. Come in.

1141
01:28:20,696 --> 01:28:21,962
Thanks, Georgie.

1142
01:28:27,303 --> 01:28:31,038
What the fuck are you doing
here? Where's Adam?

1143
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,540
He never came back.

1144
01:28:33,542 --> 01:28:35,008
Wha... what? What..

1145
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:37,344
What do you mean he never came
back? Where'd he go?

1146
01:28:37,346 --> 01:28:40,614
- I thought you'd might know.
- Why the hell would I know?

1147
01:28:40,616 --> 01:28:43,150
<i>I'm waiting
for that drink, John.</i>

1148
01:28:43,152 --> 01:28:44,951
Yeah, I'm coming.

1149
01:28:47,856 --> 01:28:49,723
No, thanks.

1150
01:28:49,725 --> 01:28:52,526
Your name is Liz.

1151
01:28:52,528 --> 01:28:55,829
I don't remember you. You were
in the same class as Georgina?

1152
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,798
Yes, John and Henry too.

1153
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,299
Um, we were all there
at the same time.

1154
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:02,536
Huh. You look younger.

1155
01:29:02,538 --> 01:29:03,737
What do you mean
you can't find him?

1156
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:05,505
What are you going
on about, John?

1157
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,674
No, I..

1158
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:10,344
There's someone that, uh, Henry

1159
01:29:10,346 --> 01:29:13,013
and I actually wanted you
to meet, but...

1160
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:16,383
- And he's gone missing?
- Yes. Yes, he has.

1161
01:29:16,385 --> 01:29:19,152
Shouldn't you be back at
the loft in case he shows up?

1162
01:29:19,154 --> 01:29:21,321
- He won't.
- What are you talking about?

1163
01:29:21,323 --> 01:29:22,622
That reminds me,
have you been able

1164
01:29:22,624 --> 01:29:25,125
to unload that Gowanus property?

1165
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:26,360
Where the fuck
could he have gone?

1166
01:29:26,362 --> 01:29:29,029
Such compassion. It's touching.

1167
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:31,264
I don't know what's taking
so long, a loft like that.

1168
01:29:31,266 --> 01:29:33,700
You might just have to clear out
all that junk.

1169
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:35,202
Anton, it's time to go.

1170
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:36,503
I don't want to leave
in the middle of the storm.

1171
01:29:36,505 --> 01:29:37,871
Mother, are you sure
you won't stay?

1172
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:41,007
No, we're leaving, I just wanted
my drink. You ready?

1173
01:29:41,009 --> 01:29:43,677
Okay, uh, Mr. Beaufort

1174
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:47,514
if I could maybe come
into the office on Monday

1175
01:29:47,516 --> 01:29:50,150
I'd love to fill you in on
the work we've been doing.

1176
01:29:50,152 --> 01:29:51,651
John, don't bother.

1177
01:29:51,653 --> 01:29:54,588
"We," who? A... a... anyway,
we... we've got to be going.

1178
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:57,691
- May I use your bathroom?
- There's one in the hall.

1179
01:29:57,693 --> 01:30:00,060
- You've been here before.
- Um, goodnight!

1180
01:30:00,062 --> 01:30:02,796
It was nice to meet you again.

1181
01:30:02,798 --> 01:30:05,031
<i>I'm sorry,
I don't remember you, dear.</i>

1182
01:30:33,328 --> 01:30:34,795
<i>The roads are gonna be a fright.</i>

1183
01:30:34,797 --> 01:30:36,096
<i>Well, talk to your father.</i>

1184
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:38,331
<i>He insists on waking up
in his own bed.</i>

1185
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:40,000
<i>Dad, you should think about
staying the night.</i>

1186
01:30:40,002 --> 01:30:41,968
<i>We'll be fine.
We'll beat the storm.</i>

1187
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:44,070
<i>Georgina, can you turn
the lights on out there?</i>

1188
01:30:44,072 --> 01:30:46,339
<i>Yes. The coast is clear.</i>

1189
01:30:46,341 --> 01:30:48,375
<i>Goodnight. Thanks for supper.</i>

1190
01:30:48,377 --> 01:30:51,144
- Goodnight dad.
- Goodnight, dear.

1191
01:30:51,146 --> 01:30:54,381
Goodbye, Henry. I remember you
were very ambitious in school.

1192
01:30:54,383 --> 01:30:56,082
You have your own practice now?

1193
01:30:57,453 --> 01:30:59,085
<i>Henry and I have been working
on a project</i>

1194
01:30:59,087 --> 01:31:00,620
<i>that I think might interest you.</i>

1195
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:02,622
<i>Just be careful who you get
mixed up with.</i>

1196
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:05,592
<i>I told my daughter
the same thing.</i>

1197
01:31:05,594 --> 01:31:09,896
- Dear, let's go.
- Goodnight. Goodnight.

1198
01:31:09,898 --> 01:31:11,865
Oh, it's already coming down
out there.

1199
01:31:11,867 --> 01:31:12,933
<i>It's gonna take us forever
to get home.</i>

1200
01:31:12,935 --> 01:31:14,401
<i>Calm down. We'll be fine.</i>

1201
01:31:14,403 --> 01:31:16,369
<i>- Do you have the keys?
- Yes, I have the keys.</i>

1202
01:31:16,371 --> 01:31:17,771
<i>Bye!</i>

1203
01:31:17,773 --> 01:31:20,006
I'm gonna go clear the plates.

1204
01:31:20,008 --> 01:31:21,875
<i>You two amuse yourselves.</i>

1205
01:31:21,877 --> 01:31:25,612
I can't believe you left him
in the city.

1206
01:31:25,614 --> 01:31:28,114
It's unbelievable.

1207
01:31:30,886 --> 01:31:33,119
- Yes!
- <i>Find what you're looking for?</i>

1208
01:31:33,121 --> 01:31:35,622
Oh! This is Henry's laptop.

1209
01:31:35,624 --> 01:31:37,157
Did you know that - Know what?

1210
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:40,393
That John would steal something?
That he would lie about it?

1211
01:31:40,395 --> 01:31:43,063
It takes more than that
to surprise me.

1212
01:31:43,065 --> 01:31:45,999
Well, this is Henry's
and we came to get it back.

1213
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:48,335
Why are you getting yourself
mixed up in all of this?

1214
01:31:48,337 --> 01:31:50,237
Maybe I'm tired of seeing John
take advantage of Henry.

1215
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,305
My husband has invested
I dare say everything

1216
01:31:52,307 --> 01:31:55,408
in whatever it is that Henry
is doing and he owns it.

1217
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:58,011
And Henry will profit from it
in one way or another

1218
01:31:58,013 --> 01:32:00,614
and you need to get over it
and stop interfering.

1219
01:32:00,616 --> 01:32:02,916
Jesus, Georgie you haven't
changed one bit

1220
01:32:02,918 --> 01:32:04,317
which is understandable
considering

1221
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:05,352
who your parents are.

1222
01:32:05,354 --> 01:32:07,354
I know, you'll always be
the good girl

1223
01:32:07,356 --> 01:32:09,489
thriving on lost causes.

1224
01:32:09,491 --> 01:32:12,259
Shouldn't you be saving souls
in the VA right now?

1225
01:32:12,261 --> 01:32:14,361
What's the point if SynTech
has one pill that can take care

1226
01:32:14,363 --> 01:32:16,463
of all of them
if they can afford it?

1227
01:32:16,465 --> 01:32:17,964
Oh, good Lord.

1228
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:19,933
When Henry came back
he wanted everything to be

1229
01:32:19,935 --> 01:32:23,336
the way it was at school,
with John as his enabler.

1230
01:32:23,338 --> 01:32:25,472
Whatever it is they're up to now

1231
01:32:25,474 --> 01:32:27,374
maybe it will make a difference.

1232
01:32:27,376 --> 01:32:29,976
<i>Maybe</i> being the operative word,
but there's also maybe not.

1233
01:32:29,978 --> 01:32:31,811
And either way,
all I see is death and sadness

1234
01:32:31,813 --> 01:32:32,913
because of what they've done.

1235
01:32:32,915 --> 01:32:34,748
Oh, God, such melodrama.

1236
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:36,983
You want melodrama? How's this.

1237
01:32:40,756 --> 01:32:43,223
What the fuck's going on?
Are you insane?

1238
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:45,492
What the fuck did you do..
What the.. What's she doing?

1239
01:32:45,494 --> 01:32:47,260
- It's over, man. It's over.
- What's over?

1240
01:32:47,262 --> 01:32:48,495
- What's over?
- He's gone.

1241
01:32:48,497 --> 01:32:50,730
- Who's, who's gone?
- Adam is dead.

1242
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:52,065
We killed him.

1243
01:32:53,268 --> 01:32:54,768
You said he left
and he didn't come back.

1244
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:57,938
Well, he did come back
carrying a dead girl.

1245
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:01,541
You were right, he's volatile.

1246
01:33:01,543 --> 01:33:04,110
No, I... I... I just,
I only said that

1247
01:33:04,112 --> 01:33:06,913
to turn you against him.

1248
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:11,017
Well, anyway, he's dead now.
Alright?

1249
01:33:11,019 --> 01:33:13,753
He's gone and buried along
with everything else.

1250
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:16,990
No one will find the evidence,
this was all just a bad dream.

1251
01:33:40,015 --> 01:33:41,881
Uh, we have to clean out
the loft.

1252
01:33:41,883 --> 01:33:43,183
<i>It's done.</i>

1253
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:47,187
<i>Henry, take me to the station.</i>

1254
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:49,189
<i>I... I need to get out
of here right now.</i>

1255
01:33:49,191 --> 01:33:50,590
<i>I need to get on a train.</i>

1256
01:33:50,592 --> 01:33:52,359
<i>We don't do trains
this side of the river.</i>

1257
01:33:52,361 --> 01:33:53,793
<i>Alright, a bus.</i>

1258
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:57,230
<i>Not at this hour.
There's a guest room upstairs.</i>

1259
01:33:57,232 --> 01:33:59,366
<i>Well, we should go now.</i>

1260
01:34:03,605 --> 01:34:05,171
No, fuck that.

1261
01:34:06,642 --> 01:34:08,775
Stay one more night.

1262
01:34:11,413 --> 01:34:13,513
For fuck's sake,
you're our oldest friends.

1263
01:34:13,515 --> 01:34:16,916
Just, just stay and have

1264
01:34:16,918 --> 01:34:19,319
have one drink with me.

1265
01:34:19,321 --> 01:34:22,622
Memorialize Adam to celebrate
the work that we did.

1266
01:34:24,626 --> 01:34:27,260
I'm going to bed.

1267
01:34:27,262 --> 01:34:30,230
Liz, if you're sensible,
you will too.

1268
01:34:30,232 --> 01:34:33,933
The guest room is at the top
of the stairs to the left.

1269
01:34:33,935 --> 01:34:35,869
Henry, I can drive.

1270
01:34:39,307 --> 01:34:41,241
We can stay the night.

1271
01:34:41,243 --> 01:34:42,876
We'll leave first thing
in the morning.

1272
01:34:42,878 --> 01:34:46,212
Alright, alright.
Just don't be up late.

1273
01:34:46,214 --> 01:34:47,747
You've already drunk enough.

1274
01:34:49,284 --> 01:34:51,718
<i>It's like school all over again.</i>

1275
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:53,720
<i>All of us together.</i>

1276
01:34:53,722 --> 01:34:56,189
<i>Fucking Liz, man.</i>

1277
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:59,159
Jesus Christ, when did she
become such a champ?

1278
01:35:01,930 --> 01:35:06,166
Ha-ha! Next time, Henry,
we'll do it legitimately.

1279
01:35:06,168 --> 01:35:09,369
I'll give you a lab,
a nice white lab

1280
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:12,138
and a nice white lab coat

1281
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:14,641
and medical cadavers.

1282
01:35:14,643 --> 01:35:17,210
<i>Because goddamn, man,
we need to do something about</i>

1283
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:19,412
the emotional baggage
that we had last time

1284
01:35:19,414 --> 01:35:21,314
because if I looked back
and I think if you looked back

1285
01:35:21,316 --> 01:35:24,684
in hindsight that was really
where we went off

1286
01:35:24,686 --> 01:35:27,253
the tracks, 'cause it certainly
wasn't you as a scientist.

1287
01:35:27,255 --> 01:35:29,889
I mean, scientifically speaking

1288
01:35:29,891 --> 01:35:32,192
as a medical doctor,
you're beyond reproach.

1289
01:35:32,194 --> 01:35:34,894
I don't know if you're quite
the daddy that you thought

1290
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:38,965
you were, but,
but a brilliant doctor, Henry.

1291
01:35:38,967 --> 01:35:41,801
Nobody questions that.

1292
01:35:41,803 --> 01:35:45,138
And I am your Igor.

1293
01:35:46,341 --> 01:35:48,208
<i>Because what did I do?
I got you bodies.</i>

1294
01:35:48,210 --> 01:35:50,176
<i>I even got you a fresh brain.</i>

1295
01:35:50,178 --> 01:35:51,644
I want some kind
of credit for that

1296
01:35:51,646 --> 01:35:54,481
but, of course, I did it.

1297
01:35:54,483 --> 01:35:56,316
I did it for you, man.

1298
01:35:58,086 --> 01:36:00,053
Because I love you.

1299
01:36:00,055 --> 01:36:01,921
<i>Doctor.</i>

1300
01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:04,457
<i>Doctor Henry Frankenstein.</i>

1301
01:36:04,459 --> 01:36:09,129
<i>Henry, not Victor just
like in the movie.</i>

1302
01:36:09,131 --> 01:36:10,563
I salute you.

1303
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:14,100
<i>Frankenstein of the Hudson.</i>

1304
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:50,697
No!

1305
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:52,298
What did you do to her?

1306
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:55,268
Listen, listen, Adam,
Liz is your friend, alright?

1307
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:56,302
Just let her go.

1308
01:37:58,673 --> 01:38:01,140
I love you, Liz. I love you.

1309
01:38:04,779 --> 01:38:05,845
No!

1310
01:38:37,946 --> 01:38:40,480
You're supposed to be dead.
I buried you.

1311
01:38:45,387 --> 01:38:47,887
<i>You want revenge?
Go after Polidori.</i>

1312
01:38:47,889 --> 01:38:50,323
He made you what you are,
he killed who you were.

1313
01:38:50,325 --> 01:38:53,693
It was you! It was you
who made me what I am!

1314
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1315
01:39:05,073 --> 01:39:07,407
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

1316
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:09,609
Look at what you've done.

1317
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:11,010
<i>You're despicable.</i>

1318
01:39:11,012 --> 01:39:13,379
- Shut up.
- My father was right about you.

1319
01:39:13,381 --> 01:39:14,714
I'm calling the police.

1320
01:39:20,689 --> 01:39:22,255
<i>No, you're not.</i>

1321
01:39:29,798 --> 01:39:31,597
Henry?

1322
01:39:31,599 --> 01:39:33,299
Henry, is that you?

1323
01:39:37,806 --> 01:39:40,306
Show yourself!

1324
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:47,480
<i>Come on, Henry!</i>

1325
01:39:54,589 --> 01:39:58,257
Take your time!
We can draw this out.

1326
01:40:02,897 --> 01:40:05,765
I don't think the odds
are in your favor though.

1327
01:40:09,971 --> 01:40:12,872
Henry, I don't think that

1328
01:40:12,874 --> 01:40:18,444
the war prepared you
for actual combat.

1329
01:40:20,248 --> 01:40:23,082
Not real combat between men.

1330
01:40:24,619 --> 01:40:25,952
No.

1331
01:40:28,356 --> 01:40:31,290
For that you need
a hunter's instinct.

1332
01:40:34,329 --> 01:40:36,896
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

1333
01:40:39,167 --> 01:40:41,801
Let's make this more
interesting.

1334
01:40:44,005 --> 01:40:48,074
And where did you go?
Come out, come out.

1335
01:40:49,944 --> 01:40:52,945
Oh, there you are.

1336
01:40:52,947 --> 01:40:56,682
You do look perturbed, Henry.

1337
01:40:56,684 --> 01:40:59,652
Whatever made you
kill your girl?

1338
01:40:59,654 --> 01:41:01,954
I mean, you know, look, I'm not

1339
01:41:01,956 --> 01:41:04,023
I'm not blaming you for it.

1340
01:41:04,025 --> 01:41:06,292
<i>Who can take it
after a while, right?</i>

1341
01:41:07,762 --> 01:41:09,195
<i>Stop.</i>

1342
01:41:09,197 --> 01:41:11,330
I will shoot you,
I will kill you.

1343
01:41:12,867 --> 01:41:15,001
I've done it before.

1344
01:41:15,003 --> 01:41:18,004
Where the fuck do you think
those bodies came from?

1345
01:41:20,108 --> 01:41:23,776
Adam! I thought
you were fucking dead.

1346
01:41:23,778 --> 01:41:25,611
What are you two up to, Henry?

1347
01:42:21,202 --> 01:42:23,870
No, no, no, Henry!

1348
01:42:23,872 --> 01:42:25,471
Henry!

1349
01:42:27,842 --> 01:42:31,310
Please. Please, please, please,
please, don't leave me.

1350
01:42:31,312 --> 01:42:33,146
<i>I'm sorry, Adam.</i>

1351
01:42:34,182 --> 01:42:36,516
I'm sorry.

1352
01:42:36,518 --> 01:42:38,351
You can forgive me.

1353
01:42:57,038 --> 01:42:59,038
I have no one.

1354
01:43:00,074 --> 01:43:02,074
Yeah, well

1355
01:43:02,076 --> 01:43:04,277
<i>companionship
is overrated anyway.</i>

1356
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:14,787
Tell me somewhere
in that pea sized brain of yours

1357
01:43:14,789 --> 01:43:16,322
you remember.

1358
01:43:17,759 --> 01:43:20,960
<i>That night? Tell me
you remember that night, huh?</i>

1359
01:43:21,796 --> 01:43:23,296
Alex?

1360
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:28,768
You.. We gave you life.

1361
01:43:30,305 --> 01:43:33,506
We gave you opportunity.

1362
01:43:33,508 --> 01:43:37,643
And what did you do with it?
You fucking squandered it. Huh?

1363
01:43:39,113 --> 01:43:41,113
<i>Whose fucking fault is that?</i>

1364
01:43:42,917 --> 01:43:45,518
<i>And, now, look.</i>

1365
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,186
<i>Everybody's dead.</i>

1366
01:43:51,192 --> 01:43:53,326
I want you to listen to me.

1367
01:43:54,229 --> 01:43:56,062
This is the way it's gonna go.

1368
01:43:57,465 --> 01:44:01,467
<i>You were the crazy creation
of a mad scientist</i>

1369
01:44:01,469 --> 01:44:04,804
<i>who went berserk
and did all of this.</i>

1370
01:44:06,841 --> 01:44:09,475
<i>They're gonna blame you
for everything. Okay?</i>

1371
01:44:09,477 --> 01:44:12,445
<i>And they're... they're gonna
blame you</i>

1372
01:44:12,447 --> 01:44:13,980
<i>they're gonna blame you
for the bodies</i>

1373
01:44:13,982 --> 01:44:15,848
<i>for the fire, for all of it.</i>

1374
01:44:17,685 --> 01:44:20,253
You fucking understand that?

1375
01:44:24,325 --> 01:44:25,825
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1376
01:44:27,662 --> 01:44:29,262
You're still so thick.

1377
01:44:34,235 --> 01:44:35,434
Goodbye, Adam.

1378
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

1379
01:45:48,109 --> 01:45:51,711
<i>I came into this world filled
with wonder.</i>

1380
01:45:54,649 --> 01:45:57,149
<i>I didn't know
how I'd come to be.</i>

1381
01:45:57,151 --> 01:45:59,785
No! No, no, no, help.

1382
01:45:59,787 --> 01:46:02,054
There's been
a break-in in my farm!

1383
01:46:02,056 --> 01:46:05,024
It's uh, On the High bridge
Road. It's about two...

1384
01:46:05,026 --> 01:46:07,526
<i>I turn to people around me</i>

1385
01:46:07,528 --> 01:46:10,162
<i>to ask for help
in making my way.</i>

1386
01:46:15,603 --> 01:46:17,670
<i>But now I know</i>

1387
01:46:17,672 --> 01:46:20,339
<i>that each was only thinking
of themselves.</i>

1388
01:46:21,743 --> 01:46:25,678
<i>They made mistakes.
I became just like them.</i>

1389
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:28,247
Adam! Stop. Please!

1390
01:46:28,249 --> 01:46:29,582
You... you have no one.

1391
01:46:29,584 --> 01:46:31,817
I'll... I'll...
I'll take care of you.

1392
01:46:31,819 --> 01:46:33,552
I'll take care of you!

1393
01:46:38,092 --> 01:46:40,860
No! No!

1394
01:46:40,862 --> 01:46:43,396
Gravity is your friend.

1395
01:46:46,601 --> 01:46:49,235
<i>And now they hate me.</i>

1396
01:46:49,237 --> 01:46:51,237
<i>And now they hunt me.</i>

1397
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:16,362
<i>I will hide and disappear</i>

1398
01:47:16,364 --> 01:47:18,364
<i>and learn not to care.</i>

1399
01:47:20,067 --> 01:47:22,668
<i>This is what
they have taught me.</i>

1400
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,214
Come on, we've got this
motherfucker!

1401
01:47:36,717 --> 01:47:38,651
<i>Don't let him get away! Stop!</i>

1402
01:47:38,653 --> 01:47:41,520
<i>Stop or we'll fire! Stop!</i>

1403
01:48:11,152 --> 01:48:13,719
Hey, I just splurged.
Double cap.

1404
01:48:15,156 --> 01:48:16,655
What's up?

1405
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:18,824
I don't know.

1406
01:48:18,826 --> 01:48:22,161
This really creepy
looking guy left it for you.

1407
01:48:22,163 --> 01:48:23,395
<i>He just walked out.</i>

1408
01:48:28,536 --> 01:48:31,403
Wait, he wa... he was here?
Where'd he go?

1409
01:48:31,405 --> 01:48:33,539
He just walked out.
