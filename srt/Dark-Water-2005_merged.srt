1
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:40,202
Dark Water

2
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,871
And tomorrow we can practice
singing, ok?

3
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:26,112
- Yeah! -OK, see you tomorrow!

4
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,220
- Bye! -See ya!

5
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,590
See ya!

6
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,657
B'bye.

7
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:03,288
Yoshimi... no one's come for you?

8
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,094
Yoshimi Matsubara

9
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,379
Well, your husband has no objections
on the division of property.

10
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,843
So it's...

11
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,286
our daughter?

12
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,652
Yes.

13
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:14,682
He's absolutely insistent
on being the legal guardian.

14
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,696
Why is he saying this now?

15
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:22,727
He has completely neglected her
from the beginning.

16
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:26,670
Perhaps it's just that
you've never noticed. He may...

17
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,764
No, that's not it at all.

18
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,709
He forgets her birthday every year.

19
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,710
Where are you living?

20
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:42,050
Presently I'm looking for aplace
for my daughter and me.

21
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:46,758
But I'll be deciding this week.

22
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,753
- Just a small question.
- Sure.

23
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:56,335
Is it true you had once received
psychiatric treatment?

24
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,707
Did he tell you that?

25
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,834
Yes.

26
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:12,416
That was before we were married.

27
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,053
Over 10 years ago now.

28
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:22,795
I was working proofreading novels
at the time, and...

29
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,354
You mean correcting spelling mistakes,
that sort of thing?

30
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,456
Right.

31
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,731
And some of the novels
lwas working on then...

32
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,329
were extremely graphic and sadistic.

33
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,069
So it was a distraction to your work.

34
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,408
No you see, the content was
just so horrible...

35
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,211
and I had to read them
over and over again.

36
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,186
So that's when
you started going for treatment?

37
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,448
Yes.

38
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,716
I see.

39
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,753
Is that going to...?

40
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,727
No, that shouldn't present a problem.

41
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:01,459
You know I...
haven't been at all since then.

42
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,365
Don't worry about it.

43
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,737
And unless something major occurs,

44
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:12,039
the mother usually has the advantage
when the child is under seven.

45
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,803
Right.

46
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:39,198
My being seen before...
that doesn't matter anymore.

47
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,833
Hey, a fact is a fact.

48
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,775
What's wrong with speaking the truth?

49
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,911
I don't think
it will get you very far now.

50
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,295
Go straight along the river.

51
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,342
Right here? Thank you very much.

52
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,382
Tired?

53
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,248
This will be the last one, ok?

54
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,519
Alright, I'm going on ahead...

55
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,162
Ikuko

56
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,836
What do you think this room's for?

57
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,939
That's where you eat.

58
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,079
How about this one?

59
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,281
Where you sleep?

60
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,857
How about this little room here?

61
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,860
That's my room!

62
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:13,264
Ok, I'm off to see lkuko's room! Bye!

63
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,629
Hey!

64
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,272
How many floors?

65
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,470
Gee, I don't know...

66
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,172
Can you count them?

67
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:12,050
So what do you think?
Areal bargain, I'd say.

68
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,592
We'll think about it.

69
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,491
Thank you.

70
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,696
Ms. Matsubara? -Yes.

71
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,329
Come right in.

72
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,971
Please, come in.

73
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,948
The apartment manager lives here too.

74
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,178
So you can feel safe
coming home at night.

75
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,961
Disappointed?

76
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,087
It is alittle old.

77
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,597
But it's built solid, you know.

78
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,963
Please.

79
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,672
Mr. Kamiya,

80
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:10,011
I told you to wipe this up.

81
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:15,418
Sorry,
a bucket of water spilled earlier.

82
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,337
After you.

83
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,013
Which way?

84
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,140
Here we are.

85
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,851
Go right in.

86
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,830
How old are you, lkuko?

87
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,596
Tell him how old you are.

88
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,830
Almost six.

89
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,838
Oh, you're in kindergarten.

90
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,203
Yup!

91
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,074
Where's my room?

92
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,442
How about this one here?

93
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,547
Yey!

94
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,646
The kindergarten is really close.

95
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:06,127
And next week
we're havingthe wallpaper replaced.

96
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,326
Then it will look as good as new.

97
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,633
The humidity in here is unreal.

98
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,112
Well, with all the rain we've had...

99
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:26,140
Most people use this room as a bedroom.

100
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,829
Oh, right...
I haven't shown you the kitchen.

101
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,571
Please.

102
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,513
We're having the kitchen done over too.

103
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,309
You'll find it very easy to use.

104
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:04,219
You knowthe other family
also liked the room.

105
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,655
"The early bird catches the worm."

106
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,919
I see.

107
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,558
It's just the two of you, right?

108
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,686
Yes.

109
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:14,790
Oh, then there's plenty of room!
A real steal.

110
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,236
Ikuko?

111
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,803
Ikuko?

112
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,277
Maybe she went outside?

113
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,453
I'm going to go check.

114
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,261
Ikuko?

115
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:03,344
Excuse me,
has my little girl been here?

116
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,219
We haven't seen her.

117
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,746
Really...

118
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,379
Baron, have you seen her?

119
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,758
He says he hasn't either.

120
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,230
Ikuko!

121
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,770
That's...

122
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,398
my daughter!

123
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,247
What floor was that?

124
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,482
Can't tell. They all look the same.

125
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,363
Ikuko?

126
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,672
Ikuko!

127
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,877
Mommy!

128
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,516
What were you doing?

129
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,715
Iwas looking all over for you.

130
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,384
Where did you get this?

131
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,394
It was lying on the ground.

132
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:31,690
Where?

133
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,391
Over there.

134
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,972
There aren't any kids living here now.

135
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:47,972
Well maybe some kids came over to play.

136
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,778
Your lucky day.

137
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,884
No.

138
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,954
She can't have these.

139
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:04,052
We don't know who they belong to.

140
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,482
Careful now, hon.

141
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,040
No problem!

142
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,924
"Lost and Found"

143
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,192
Mine!

144
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,493
Hey!

145
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,125
Come back here!

146
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,004
You silly!

147
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,150
The sound really carries, huh.

148
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,982
Yeah, it really carries.

149
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,450
Gottabe careful, huh.

150
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,115
Yeah, careful!

151
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,166
What the...

152
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,919
Count 10 times each tooth now.

153
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,819
Yup, I am!

154
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,891
Chee-ze! Chee-ze!

155
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,565
Everyone, I'd like to introduce...

156
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,128
our newfriend, lkuko Matsubara.

157
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,101
Hi, I'm lkuko Matsubara.

158
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,775
I think we can do better than that!

159
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,048
Alright! Pleased to meet you!

160
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,658
Nice job!

161
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,990
What floor, ma'am?

162
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,155
First floor, please.

163
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,823
Certainly.

164
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,428
What's...

165
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,453
Hello?

166
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,089
Excuse me.

167
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:35,429
There's water leaking from our ceiling.

168
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:41,937
I'm Yoshimi Matsubara,
just moved into Rm. 305.

169
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:46,671
There's a wet spot on my ceiling,
and water dripping down from it.

170
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,680
Wellthe building is very old, you see.

171
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,741
So it gets a little rickety.

172
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:57,788
Ok, and so...?

173
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,749
I'll make a note of it in the log.

174
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,913
Ok, everyone!

175
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,815
Quiet and listen up now.

176
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:30,883
Iwant to introduce our newest friend
on her first day!

177
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,789
Can youte II us your name?

178
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,721
Hi, I'm lkuko Matsubara!

179
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,729
Now let's all be good friends
with lkuko, ok?

180
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,267
Ok!

181
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,897
Please. - Thank you.

182
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:56,342
We believe in giving children
the freedom to do what they desire.

183
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,883
This is our basic
educational philosophy.

184
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,416
All our kids are really outgoing.

185
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,750
Ikuko will make friends in no time.

186
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,914
Thank you.

187
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,252
Not at all.

188
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,794
Oh, thank you.

189
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,820
Thank you. - Please.

190
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,063
Sir, Kobajashi's here.

191
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:27,777
I hear you called
Ms. Tsushima"stupid"?

192
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,405
Come on, you're almost in
first grade now.

193
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,047
You said it to Kusano and Uesugi,
right?

194
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,884
That Ms. Tsushima was stupid.

195
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,885
Why is she "stupid"?

196
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,993
What was it you said...

197
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:47,225
"Ms. Tsushimais stupid
because she's fat."

198
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,857
Right?

199
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,232
What's that all about?
Everyone overweight is "stupid"?

200
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,897
Well?

201
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,073
What are you crying for?!

202
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,910
Kobajashi!

203
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:09,013
Yes, why?
You think it's our fault?

204
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,817
Well, it's nobody's but your own!

205
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

206
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,571
Hello?

207
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,973
Hello?

208
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:55,981
The place may be old,
but I really doubt that's the cause.

209
00:25:56,054 --> 00:26:02,357
I think it's a plumbing leak
from somewhere above us.

210
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:06,222
Maybe the room right above you...

211
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,495
That's what I thought,
so I went up and checked.

212
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,331
But no one answered...

213
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,700
All done.

214
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:19,168
Ok, I'll tell the apartment manager
myself tomorrow.

215
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,235
No, you see...

216
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,441
he won't lift a finger,
that's why I called you.

217
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:28,350
But I'm not involved with management,
you see.

218
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,786
But water is...

219
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:34,120
dripping down from my ceiling.

220
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,833
Ok, see you tomorrow!

221
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:10,224
Sorry to keep you waiting,
I was a little tied up.

222
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,154
Where were we...

223
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,625
Oh yes, Yoshimi Matsubara.

224
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,830
You have previous experience, correct?

225
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,634
I worked up until six years ago.

226
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:23,731
Right, right...

227
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,143
At Sanyu Publishing...
quite a large company.

228
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:31,071
As you can tell, we're quite small.

229
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,876
Why did you leave Sanyu?

230
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:39,118
I got married and then had a child.

231
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,487
Oh-right, right.

232
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:45,822
Are you sure you'd be happy here?

233
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:49,095
The pay wouldn't be as high, you know.

234
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,364
Well, I'm in a situation right now
where...

235
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,099
I really want to start working soon.

236
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,435
Of course,

237
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,875
I don't mean taking ajob
just anywhere...

238
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:02,674
That's alright. I understand.

239
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,639
Mr. Kono!

240
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:06,877
Coming!

241
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,441
Excuse me again.

242
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,817
Sorry about this.

243
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:11,585
What is it?

244
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:20,664
Bye, now. Thank you.

245
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,833
There's mommy.

246
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

247
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,354
Hello?

248
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:59,562
Who's picking up Yoshimi?
She's been waiting all alone for...

249
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,732
What? You can't just...!

250
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:12,509
So who's coming to pick her up today?

251
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,710
I see.

252
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,661
Yoshimi

253
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:33,268
Today, daddy's coming to get you.
So just a little bit longer, ok?

254
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,940
What about mommy?

255
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,836
Mommy? Well, she...

256
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,269
Sir, what can I say?

257
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,602
Tomorrow is just too early for us to...

258
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,673
Ms. Matsubara?

259
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,244
Oh yes, I worked at...

260
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,716
Sanyu until I had my daughter
six years ago.

261
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,443
My job was proofreading,
and I look forward...

262
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:24,920
to working with you.

263
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,618
Right...

264
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,387
Hey, wait a second...

265
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,688
Ms. Matsubara!

266
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,936
Ikuko

267
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,840
Ikuko...

268
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,942
Have you seen this child?

269
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:27,015
Mitsuko Kawai (5), born 11/3/93,
4'5", 45lbs., long black hair.

270
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:32,318
Last seen 7/14/99,
wearing a hooded yellow raincoat.

271
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:01,912
Ikuko!

272
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,781
Mommy!

273
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:05,922
What are you doing!

274
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,514
I had no choice!

275
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,820
You didn't pick her up!

276
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,383
Stay out of this.

277
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,693
Waiting there all alone...

278
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,097
Do you know how that feels?!

279
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,129
Come on.

280
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,509
Let's go.

281
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:58,535
- It's so pretty. - It is, isn't it!

282
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,839
Want to try?

283
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,420
Let's get some on the way home.

284
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,899
Where should we do them?

285
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:28,595
We'd get in trouble
on the balcony, huh.

286
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,601
Mommy?

287
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:39,740
I don't need anyone but you.

288
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:47,155
Did daddy say something to you?

289
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,534
I'm sorry, hon.

290
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,705
You know what?

291
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:12,538
I can handle anything,
just as long as you're with me.

292
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,274
You have one new message.

293
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:42,769
This is Mr. Kono
from Mitsuba Publishing.

294
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:47,778
I'm really sorry for all the commotion
today at your interview.

295
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,214
Anyway I was thinking, if you'd like,

296
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,621
we could have you start
tomorrow proofreading.

297
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:54,715
No!

298
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:55,986
What?

299
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,553
I just got ajob!

300
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,791
Really? Alright!

301
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,934
You did it!

302
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:16,143
Top floor, ma'am?

303
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,112
Please!

304
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

305
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,615
Fourth floor -toys.

306
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,179
Going up!

307
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,725
Ok!

308
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,248
Come on!

309
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,967
No!

310
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,395
Ikuko, don't

311
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:50,262
Ow! That hurts!

312
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,709
There! Lwin!

313
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,250
But that's not yours, Mitsuko.

314
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,344
No fair.

315
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,821
What?

316
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:45,326
I like this one, so I'll give you
this one here.

317
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,462
You like it?

318
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:50,762
Ikuko, turn off the water
and come on out.

319
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:55,704
But she loves the bath...
We've been in here so long.

320
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,844
Come on now, time to come out.

321
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,449
Ok, let's play hide and seek!

322
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:14,718
Yey!

323
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,153
Once, twice, three...

324
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,526
Rock, paper, scissors!

325
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,390
Ok, Mao's "it"!

326
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:31,070
One... two... three...

327
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,035
four...

328
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,439
Hey, can I...

329
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:40,849
This is our spot. Hide over there.

330
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,000
I'm ready!

331
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,885
What happened?

332
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,112
Well...

333
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:27,419
She "threw up and collapsed"?
That's never happened before.

334
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:31,261
You probably forced her
to do something.

335
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:32,226
Not at all...

336
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:33,558
Youtwo...

337
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,861
Just what have you done to my child!

338
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,560
We haven't done anything.

339
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:38,533
But...

340
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,297
Try and calm down.

341
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,430
Come on, let's talk.

342
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:50,276
It seems that lately,
lkuko has been behaving oddly.

343
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:54,940
Apparently she talks to herself alot.

344
00:40:56,153 --> 00:41:00,556
I also hear you're divorced.

345
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:04,253
That must be affecting her.

346
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:08,892
We see this alot
with children of divorced parents.

347
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:54,734
"Come home soon, Mitsuko"

348
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,541
As amatter of fact,
she used to behave oddly to.

349
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,552
However in Mitsuko's case,

350
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:07,751
her mother had abandoned her.
Just got up and left one day.

351
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,960
You never heard of her?

352
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,997
The girl who disappeared two years ago.

353
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:18,632
Mitsuko Kawai.
She was one of our kids here.

354
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,080
Is she...

355
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,347
still missing?

356
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,419
Yes.

357
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:44,651
I think she was kidnapped
by some perverted individual.

358
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,795
Excuse me?

359
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:57,063
Apparently you're late picking up lkuko
almost every day.

360
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:04,070
"Almost every day"?
That's an exaggeration...

361
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,680
Oh?

362
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,108
Well, sometimes...

363
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,711
I get there late because of work,
but really...

364
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,155
"Every day"...who told you that?

365
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:19,161
And is it true you yanked her arm
and dislocated her shoulder?

366
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,594
Dislocated it?

367
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:24,657
Why no... of course not!

368
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:30,540
And how about wandering around
aimlessly at night?

369
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,301
Do you deny this?

370
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:43,350
I was a child then.

371
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,754
My parents had divorced.

372
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:52,392
Apparently I did such things
without realizing it.

373
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,490
But it was only for a short period.

374
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:03,831
And I can assure you
that would never happen now.

375
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,741
If the mother can't show
she can raise the child...

376
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,745
Stop exaggerating everything!

377
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,337
What are you talking about?!

378
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,404
Don't deny it!

379
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,350
- Please, let's remain calm.
- Who is he!

380
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:20,085
I'm Mr. Hamada's private lawyer
Masato Nishioka...

381
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,091
Using a guy like this...

382
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,456
as your personal spy!

383
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,095
Hey, I'm just worried about lkuko.

384
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,464
Since when?

385
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,701
I don't care how you rationalize it...

386
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,205
stop playing dirty!!

387
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,833
Please, both of you.

388
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,433
We need to set the next date.

389
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,773
Right. Sorry.

390
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:06,896
So it was you...

391
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,299
And the bag... you put it there.

392
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,204
What?

393
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:13,140
The red bag, on the roof!

394
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,373
- Why did you do that?!
- What are you talking about!

395
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:19,473
- Why?! -Ms. Matsubara!

396
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,848
Take it easy!

397
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,287
Let's go inside, Mr. Hamdada.

398
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,737
Are you alright?

399
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:58,449
Itake it... you're still
in the middle of mediations.

400
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:08,264
If you let them see you like this,

401
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:12,564
they'll think you're unstable,
which can only hurt you.

402
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:23,709
My secretary's off today,
so this may be a little strong.

403
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:32,652
Woops! Forgot the cream and sugar.

404
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:38,360
If they take her away from me...

405
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:40,258
I...

406
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,339
Your husband seems pretty serious.

407
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:55,301
He could move against you anywhere,
anytime.

408
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,710
They say with children under seven,

409
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:03,878
the mother has the advantage.

410
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:09,457
But if you continue along this path,
growing weaker by the day,

411
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:13,292
it will be nearly impossible for you
to gain custody.

412
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,303
In any case,
nowis the most criticaltime.

413
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,966
If you want to continue
living with your daughter,

414
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:30,605
the first thing you needto do
is pull yourself together.

415
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:34,916
Right...

416
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:40,980
Come on, we can't get very far
like that now.

417
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:45,826
It'll be alright.
Let's fight this together.

418
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,832
Thank you.

419
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:13,322
Did she eat her lunch?

420
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,516
Sure did.

421
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:18,357
Girls are just the cutest things.

422
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:33,772
Auntie, leaving already?

423
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:35,903
Yup, have to stop off at the store.

424
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,413
You knowhowhe leaves it all to me.

425
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,414
Sorry, I know it's far...

426
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,078
You're the only one I can ask.

427
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,451
That's ok.

428
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:48,753
You've done well with lkuko.

429
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,790
A far cry from the mother you had.

430
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:56,794
She just couldn't think of anyone
but herself...

431
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:57,959
Ok, see ya.

432
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,502
Thanks.

433
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,004
Bye.

434
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,142
Thanks.

435
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,630
Ikuko...

436
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,874
Ikuko

437
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,682
Ikuko!

438
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

439
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,444
Ikuko...

440
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:40,842
Mommy!

441
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

442
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:27,856
Ikuko...

443
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,598
Ikuko

444
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,085
Ikuko?

445
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,886
Are you there?

446
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,243
It's me... Is lkuko with you?

447
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:00,577
No.

448
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,042
Don't lie.

449
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:04,586
I wouldn't lie about that!

450
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:08,454
Why, what happened?

451
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:14,128
Yoshimi! What's going on?!

452
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:15,596
Ikuko!

453
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Iku... Ikuko!

454
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:40,450
Hello! Open up!

455
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:42,918
Hello!

456
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,960
Ikuko, are you in there?

457
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:46,493
Ikuko?

458
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:48,121
Ikuko...

459
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,020
Ikuko?

460
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,487
Are you here?

461
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,161
Ikuko?

462
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,707
Ikuko!

463
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:25,058
Shoji and Mitsuko Kawai

464
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:29,428
Mitsuko Kawai...

465
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:06,094
May I come in?

466
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:08,736
Sure.

467
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:24,811
What are you doing?

468
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:27,451
We're moving out.

469
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:33,652
So lkuko will...

470
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,221
have to change kindergarten again?

471
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:38,490
That's right.

472
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,400
Why not wait a while?

473
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:45,105
I can't.

474
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:50,402
Ms. Matsubara,

475
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,677
...you know we're at a disadvantage
as it stands.

476
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:59,414
If you move again now, think of how
the committee will view this.

477
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,582
I don't want to hear that now!

478
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,158
Mitsuko has returned
to the apartment upstairs,

479
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:07,162
and she's trying to take lkuko away!

480
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:14,626
So the room upstairs was open...

481
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:19,671
I realize you're busy,

482
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:23,303
...but I'd like you to see this.

483
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:27,114
What the...?

484
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,172
Mr. Kamiya!

485
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:31,152
But I locked it...

486
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:50,195
Wow, you were right...

487
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:55,137
What in the name of...

488
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:01,144
The family of that girl
who disappeared...

489
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,707
when did they move out?

490
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,152
Well, let's see...

491
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:09,191
the end of last year, wasn't it?

492
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:16,496
The father lived here
for a while by himself.

493
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,933
Said his little girl would have
no place to come home to.

494
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:22,364
Which means,

495
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:29,173
the water in here may have been running
for the past six months.

496
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:33,409
Mr. Kamiya

497
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:38,213
Ms. Matsubara complained to you
about this, didn't she?

498
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,318
Did you look into it?

499
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:45,658
Mr. Kamiya

500
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:49,889
There are alot of people
in line for your job.

501
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,560
Alot of people to replace you.

502
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:54,393
Mr. Ohta

503
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,329
I believe she also called you.

504
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,465
We'll... I'm uh...

505
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:00,600
Well...

506
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,735
what about the footsteps I heard?

507
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:09,907
Well, we know lkuko was in here.

508
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,812
So someone else
could have gotten in too.

509
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,662
The bag was lying right here.

510
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:31,234
Did youthrow it away again?

511
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,308
Well, I threwit away once.

512
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,310
But that's all I know.

513
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:39,040
So it's disappeared...

514
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:45,612
Maybe part of some superstition.

515
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:49,889
Either way, it must be the local kids.

516
01:03:56,365 --> 01:04:00,301
Look how dirty this thing is...

517
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:01,768
Do you have it cleaned?

518
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:04,463
That's the cleaning company's job.

519
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,303
I can go now, right?

520
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:07,740
Woops...

521
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,744
Think he's upset?

522
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:14,374
And then right over there,

523
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:16,577
I saw someone.

524
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,317
Did you get a clear look?

525
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,849
It was just for an instant,
but I saw something.

526
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,861
But I'll bet no one was there
when you checked.

527
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,022
Well, yes...

528
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:36,094
See the highway over there?

529
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,975
And the neon sign on that building.

530
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:45,637
This water tank is exposedto light
from all around.

531
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:50,518
So if something passed
in front of the light,

532
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:53,316
it would cast a shadow on the tank.

533
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:59,428
Then it would be natural for your eyes
to play tricks on you.

534
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:02,961
Although,

535
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:08,128
coming up here all alone at night
and seeing what you saw...

536
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,898
that would scare anyone.

537
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:39,432
Your husband's lawyer
has also looked this over,

538
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:41,436
and has agreed to the terms.

539
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:46,774
I don't think this will
compromise your position at all.

540
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:48,503
Thank you.

541
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:51,806
Just remember,

542
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:56,045
this is simply a set of legal points
worked out by lawyers.

543
01:05:56,619 --> 01:06:03,388
So just continue with your daily
routine, and try to remain focused.

544
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,926
Iwill.

545
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:08,486
Hey, you're just about there.

546
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:12,994
Ikuko.

547
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:15,669
Ready to go back to school?

548
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:16,727
Sure!

549
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,504
Well, you sure seem better!

550
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:21,600
I would...

551
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:25,408
really like to thank you
for all you've done.

552
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:29,414
By myself, I was so confused...

553
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:30,645
Not at all.

554
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:34,579
I can see lkuko needs you.

555
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:38,487
And that you need her. That's all.

556
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:50,831
I can see now
that I need to be stronger.

557
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,704
But it's not over yet.

558
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:01,949
The final decision will probably
be made at the next session.

559
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,918
In any case,

560
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:07,478
even if something happens before then,

561
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:09,857
don't act alone.

562
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:14,054
Contact me immediately.

563
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,859
Iwill.

564
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,498
One, two, three!

565
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:45,153
All auntie makes is okayu rice.

566
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:48,594
Hey come on, youwere sick.

567
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:52,558
It's good though, isn't it?

568
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,999
I like this better.

569
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:02,970
She brought her own water
to make dinner.

570
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:04,012
She did?

571
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:08,047
Yeah, she said
the water here is no good.

572
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,518
Yeah...

573
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:15,514
the water here is
definitely not the cleanest.

574
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,956
Are you sure about school tomorrow?

575
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,689
I'm sure!

576
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:25,632
Alright! Let's get your things ready.

577
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:28,101
Ok, I'll go look for your bag.

578
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:50,088
Ikuko... how did this get in here?

579
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,816
I don't know.

580
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:53,923
Did you go back to the roof?

581
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:55,122
I swear, I don't know.

582
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:58,189
I won't be mad,
so just tell me the truth.

583
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,234
Did you go up there?

584
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,963
No!

585
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:10,678
Ok.

586
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,138
I'm sorry.

587
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:36,295
Connecting to personal voicemail...

588
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:39,336
Hello, this is Kishida...

589
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,883
Hello, Kishida Law Offices.

590
01:09:56,959 --> 01:10:00,156
Hi, my name is Yoshimi Matsubara.

591
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:01,628
Is Mr. Kishida there?

592
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:06,292
He's out at the moment, and
we don't expect him back today.

593
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,630
Is that so?

594
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:11,001
Well, thank you very much.

595
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,447
No!

596
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:38,860

What the...

607
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:36,633
There we are.

608
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:39,636
I'll never leave you alone again.

609
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:43,269
I'm always going to be with you.

610
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:46,576
It's going to be ok.

611
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:10,390
Ikuko?

612
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:13,426
Mommy...

613
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:18,626
Mommy?

Mommy!

618
01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:52,466
No!

619
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:54,001
Stay there!

620
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:02,408
Please... Stop...

621
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:05,537
I'm not your mother!

622
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,438
Mommy!

623
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,952
No, lkuko!

624
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:15,087
Stop!

625
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,154
Ikuko!

626
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,008
I'm...

627
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:48,479
your mother.

628
01:24:25,627 --> 01:24:26,889
Mommy!

629
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:23,075
Mommy!

630

10 years later

631
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:16,395
- Let's give her a call. - Ok.

632
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:27,900
Hello? We're here.

633
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:31,743
Ok, we'll be waiting here... bye.

634
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:32,905
Is she coming?

635
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:35,347
Yeah, said she'd be right down.

636
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,600
- Let's get some ice cream.
- Alright!

637
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:04,702
Come on.

638
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:08,639
Ikuko, what about you?

639
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:12,015
What? ...No, I'm all set.

640
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:24,822
I don't remember much from
when I was in kindergarten.

641
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:28,230
Just that for a very brief period...

642
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:32,831
Iwas living together with my mother.

643
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:40,838
- Mommy! -I'm sorry, honey.

644
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,414
See? There she is!

645
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:47,079
- I'm so sorry. - Not at all.

646
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,850
Ok, see you tomorrow.

647
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:49,821
Bye!

648
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:51,085
B'bye.

Yoshimi and lkuko Matsubara

650
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:44,988
Mom?

651
01:32:50,464 --> 01:32:52,625
Welcome home.

652
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:57,498
You've gotten so big.

653
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:02,304
Why...?

654
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:06,479
Nobody told me.

655
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:12,753
Have you been living here
all this time?

656
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:24,359
My friend's house is right near here.

657
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:26,457
I'm going over there today.

658
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,801
It's next to my old kindergarten.

659
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:32,532
The Shimizus, do you know them?

660
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:37,036
That's my kindergarten, isn't it...

661
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:39,671
over at the bus stop.

662
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:50,313
This used to be... my glass.

663
01:33:58,332 --> 01:34:02,063
So you're already in high school...

664
01:34:03,404 --> 01:34:06,100
How time flies!

665
01:34:09,877 --> 01:34:14,280
If only I had known, I would've
come to see you long before this.

666
01:34:14,348 --> 01:34:16,111
That's ok.

667
01:34:17,718 --> 01:34:20,243
You came to see me today.

668
01:34:24,725 --> 01:34:26,192
Mom?

669
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:31,458
Remember when you said,

670
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:35,396
that you could handle anything
just as long as I was with you?

671
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:38,264
Of course.

672
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:44,141
Do you... still feel that way?

673
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:49,307
Yes, I do.

674
01:34:50,951 --> 01:34:52,282
Good.

675
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:55,313
Mom...

676
01:34:56,424 --> 01:34:59,188
Could I live here together with you?

677
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:06,388
I'll tell dad myself, alright?

678
01:35:07,268 --> 01:35:09,862
I'm sure he'd be ok with it.

679
01:35:10,237 --> 01:35:14,731
He has a new wife now,
and more children.

680
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:19,345
I...

681
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:33,286
Ikuko...

682
01:35:40,801 --> 01:35:43,861
I'm sorry, honey...

683
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:47,305
that we can't be together.

684
01:36:18,372 --> 01:36:19,669
Mom?

685
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:26,242
Mom!

686
01:37:37,618 --> 01:37:41,952
My mother was here all that time,

687
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:43,751
...protecting me.
