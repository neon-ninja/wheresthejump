1
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:25,880
- What?
- I was just thinking of a time.

2
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,390
- You want to hear it?
- Play something else.

3
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,735
No, no, no. It's a good one.

4
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,396
You just turned 15, you were a senior,

5
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:36,623
you took me out
in Mom's old station wagon.

6
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:40,652
Remember? The Dragon Wagon.
You were gonna teach me how to drive.

7
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:44,206
And there was that one tree
and nothing else...

8
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:52,807
...someone banged into the car
while we were inside...

9
00:01:52,907 --> 00:01:55,775
That's right. You actually lied for me.

10
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,896
- I lied for me.
- No, come on. You lied for both of us.

11
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:04,126
You actually did something decent for me.
That's a part of history you can't change.

12
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,328
That was a stop sign.

13
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:10,730
You're kidding, right?

14
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,765
In your car, I'd be kidding?

15
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:16,278
On this road?
I haven't seen a car in 50 miles.

16
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:27,286
Come on, Darry.

17
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,095
"Gay Fever!" No, "Gay Forever."

18
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:47,466
"Gay Forever." That's mine.
That's three for little bro'.

19
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:50,569
That's a 6, not a G, you idiot.

20
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,910
That's "Sexy Forever." That's mine.

21
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,983
- That's five to two.
- Shit.

22
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,051
"Gay Fever?"

23
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,393
Sexy forever, huh?

24
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:15,736
You know that is you in 40 years.

25
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,435
There's usually a reason
when you like the long way home.

26
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,448
Gee, like, maybe I like the country?

27
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:27,408
Okay.

28
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:28,741
Just drive, brat.

29
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,244
I'm only thinking the same thing
Mom and Dad are gonna be thinking.

30
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:37,293
"Trisha, why are you driving home
for spring break with your brat brother...

31
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:41,887
"and not heading off somewhere with
that nice 'Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team Guy'?"

32
00:03:41,987 --> 00:03:44,256
I will tell them
the same thing I'll tell you:

33
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:46,358
None of your goddamn business.

34
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:48,464
What?

35
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:52,398
You don't think I could understand
the complex nature of your relationships?

36
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,967
No, I look at you as a real expert.

37
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,377
Whatever. I don't care.

38
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,873
I'm just saying,
if you broke it off with him...

39
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:04,376
you should at least figure out
what you're gonna tell Mom and Dad.

40
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:07,756
- They're the ones in love with the guy.
- What would Jesus do...

41
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:12,017
I am no fanatic.
What I am is a fan of God!

42
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:14,893
...a serpent-headed demon,
shaking you by the...

43
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,268
You wanted the back way home.

44
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,459
That's 10 hours of preachers,
farm reports...

45
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:23,005
Could you possibly just shut up
and drive, please?

46
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:27,233
"You broke my heart in two

47
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,770
"Now I can't find the duct tape

48
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,214
"To put it together for you

49
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,074
Come on, girl, sing along now.

50
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,121
"When I met you, I thought I would die

51
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,857
"I wanted to cry

52
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,425
"Didn't know you were evil

53
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,118
"Or that you would hurt me

54
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:50,223
"Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team guy

55
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,834
"Turns out you're a twit and a real..."

56
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:57,930
Jesus!

57
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,240
- What the hell is his problem?
- Just get out of his way, Darry!

58
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,319
Let him pass you, Darry!
What are you doing?

59
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,887
Go around me!

60
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,153
Get off the road and let him pass you!

61
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:24,063
- He's nuts!
- I know he's nuts. Pull over!

62
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:28,160
Go around me!

63
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,400
- Slow down and let him fucking pass you!
- I'm trying!

64
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,150
Jesus!

65
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:49,421
Shit!

66
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,017
What the hell was his problem?

67
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:56,657
My first guess? Inbreeding!

68
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:00,593
Get a load of that nasty old thing.

69
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:05,142
What is that, the vehicle of choice
for assholes and fucking serial killers?

70
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,806
God.

71
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:13,810
You know what I just thought of, right?

72
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,476
Kenny and Darla?

73
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,979
They died about a 100 miles from here.

74
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,288
- The same highway.
- This highway runs the length of the state.

75
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:26,854
You believe it?

76
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:29,822
That they had to go looking for her head?

77
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,924
That they never found them, only the car.

78
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:35,301
No, they never found her head.
They found the car.

79
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,196
Didn't find him or her head.

80
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,098
Look at me, I'm still shaking!

81
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:42,001
You don't think every generation
has their cautionary tale...

82
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,136
of drinking and driving on Prom night?

83
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:47,945
I always heard it was true.
Wheaton Valley High, class of '78.

84
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:51,888
You wanna know something?

85
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:54,216
When I first heard that story...

86
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,192
I used to think this was the highway
I would die on.

87
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:03,890
Quite the cheery thinker today,
aren't we, sis?

88
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,731
What's "Poli-Sci Guy"
been doing to you, anyway?

89
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:12,040
"Beating you?"

90
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,335
That was the license plate
on the van we just saw.

91
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,176
B-E-A-T-N-G-U.

92
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:22,350
So "Beating You."

93
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:25,678
That's mine. That's three to five.

94
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,546
- You can't call it now.
- My ass!

95
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:30,182
- You have to call it when you see it.
- I was in shock!

96
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:32,751
- Tough!
- What is this, a brand new rule?

97
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,086
It's always been this way.

98
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:35,788
- Since when?
- Since always.

99
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,723
Since just now, maybe.

100
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:40,429
- Your memory's for shit.
- No, it's not.

101
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:50,679
Nah, infinity.

102
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,707
Uh-huh, infinity squared.

103
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,553
- Okay, name it.
- What?

104
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,314
When we made the rule that you had to
call it as soon as you see it.

105
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:04,451
Would you give it up already?

106
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,186
That's 'cause the rule has always been...

107
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,892
the first person who calls it, gets it.

108
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,499
You talk to Mom lately?

109
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:15,035
To tell her I'd be home for break.

110
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:18,039
She sound weird?

111
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:20,701
What?

112
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,013
Did you listen to her voice?

113
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,239
Could you specify, please?

114
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,178
Forget it.

115
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,410
Did you drink the last water?

116
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,618
The last one was mine.

117
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,750
You are a class act, you know that?

118
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,454
You live off-campus.

119
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:42,121
You ever try and do laundry in a dorm?

120
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,667
What they don't steal, they dye pink.

121
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:48,527
I've got 12 pairs
of rosy-pink jockey shorts.

122
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:51,230
Maybe they know something about you,
you don't.

123
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,600
"Hi, Mom. Haven't seen you in forever.
Here's my dirty shorts."

124
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,577
It's for her, not me.

125
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:01,608
What? I have to bring home laundry.
If I don't, she gets depressed.

126
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:05,922
She thinks I don't need her anymore
or something.

127
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,588
I'm serious.

128
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:10,083
- Goof.
- Bitch.

129
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,186
- Mama's boy.
- Daddy's whore.

130
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:16,357
- Dick licker.
- Ball sniffer.

131
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,669
- Ass kisser.
- Butt picker.

132
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,371
Repeat. "Ass" and "butt." You lose.

133
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,774
- I think maybe something's wrong.
- You always think something's wrong.

134
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:40,721
Like you would notice anything past the
point of your own selfish little existence.

135
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:43,149
She's not happy.

136
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,925
- Not like she used to be.
- Who is?

137
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,664
Mom's not...

138
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:57,434
It's "Beating You."

139
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:05,238
What's he doing?

140
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,450
What the hell is that?

141
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,594
What the hell was he doing?

142
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:30,429
He dumped something down that pipe.

143
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,236
Wrapped in a sheet.

144
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:34,900
Wrapped and roped in a sheet.

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,072
Wrapped and roped in a sheet
with red stains on it.

146
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,740
Just get us out of here.

147
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,542
- Grab my cell phone.
- Where?

148
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,212
It's in the gym bag.

149
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:55,990
Oh, Jesus...

150
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:59,699
You gotta be kidding me.

151
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:06,999
The point of having a portable phone
is that it works when you need it!

152
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,300
I have a power cable for it.

153
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,244
And I have a cigarette lighter
that doesn't work.

154
00:11:11,703 --> 00:11:14,039
Goddamn it, what did I say? My car!

155
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,743
We should've taken my car!

156
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,187
He's coming up right on our ass.

157
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:32,099
What the hell has he got in that thing?
He's got it souped up or something.

158
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,373
Darry...

159
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,479
- He's coming up right on our ass.
- What the fuck is in that thing?

160
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,027
You're out of your fucking mind!

161
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,707
What the hell's your problem?

162
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,449
Fuck me! Go!

163
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,552
What the hell's the matter with you!

164
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,619
- Darry, what are you doing?
- Hang on.

165
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,221
Just don't kill us, okay?

166
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,279
Sounds all right.

167
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,214
What?

168
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,647
Like either one of us would know.

169
00:13:35,747 --> 00:13:37,351
I know a little.

170
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:39,217
Your car makes a strange noise...

171
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:41,520
you just get a new tape, Darry.
You told me.

172
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,963
I told you?

173
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:45,432
I learned it from you.

174
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,293
Jesus Christ...

175
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,205
Whoa, wait.

176
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:57,108
I'm thinking past the point of my own
selfish little existence now, okay?

177
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:05,684
We're both pretty damn sure what
we saw him dump down that pipe, right?

178
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,058
What if it's someone still alive?

179
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,585
What if it was?

180
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:16,221
Someone who needs help.

181
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,690
We can get help as fast
by getting to a phone.

182
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,859
You have any idea how far
to the nearest phone?

183
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,394
We were just attacked!

184
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,100
And you don't even wanna find out why?

185
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,569
We look in the pipe, that's it.

186
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,905
Is this your idea of a little adventure
or something?

187
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,141
'Cause this is why girls
are smarter, okay?

188
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:39,578
We look in the pipe, if there's
nothing there, nothing we can do...

189
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,980
we just drive on home and call the cops.

190
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,815
You know that's what we should do.

191
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:46,054
- Bullshit, I do.
- Bullshit, you don't!

192
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,921
Look me in the eye and tell me
you can just drive away.

193
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:51,957
Leave who's ever back there, back there.

194
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,327
Maybe find out later they'd still be alive
if you'd just gone back.

195
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,496
Don't make this about
the right thing to do.

196
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:02,136
You just wanna go back there see if there's
something nasty at the end of that pipe.

197
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:05,539
Okay.

198
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:10,048
And what if it was you back there?

199
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:18,617
I'm not getting out of this car.

200
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,594
- You don't have to.
- I'm not.

201
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,419
Jesus, it's a church.

202
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,969
What's with all the birds?

203
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,053
I'm just gonna look.

204
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:18,172
Let's do this and do it fast.

205
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:42,494
Oh, my God.

206
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:51,540
- Doesn't look like a sewer pipe.
- Doesn't smell like one either.

207
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,508
Come on, you can't see anything in there.

208
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,815
You can see light down there.

209
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,113
Get a flashlight.

210
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,084
Come on, get a flashlight.

211
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:06,257
Hello!

212
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:10,662
Anybody down there?

213
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:17,297
Hey! Anybody down there?

214
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,178
Hello!

215
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:31,920
Hurry up. Come on.

216
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,122
Hello!

217
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,749
There's someone there, I heard them.

218
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:39,385
Hello!

219
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:43,096
You're hearing things, Darry.

220
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:47,401
Darry, don't even think about it!

221
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,369
- Darry!
- I told you I heard someone.

222
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:52,664
You know the part in scary movies...

223
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,000
where somebody does something
really stupid...

224
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,935
and everybody hates them for it?

225
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,139
This is it.

226
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,441
- Hello!
- No, Darry!

227
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,343
- Let me slide down.
- God damn it!

228
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,846
- Let me get a little way in.
- You're not going.

229
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:11,291
I'm not. Just hold my feet.

230
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:13,992
The feet?

231
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:28,905
Anybody down there?

232
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,641
When was the last time
you washed these socks?

233
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:34,575
I see something.

234
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:37,742
- Hello!
- I am counting to 10.

235
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:39,010
Something's moving.

236
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,346
Then I am letting go
and going back to my car.

237
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Quiet!
I just saw it again.
Something is definitely moving down there.

238
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,056
Rats!

239
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,533
- What?
- Rats!

240
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:56,971
Rats!

241
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:18,526
Darry!

242
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:23,423
Oh, God, Darry, talk to me!

243
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:28,700
Darry, say something!

244
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:34,766
Are you okay?

245
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,584
How are you gonna get out of there, Dar?

246
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:54,387
You suck.

247
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,130
God, I am so sorry.

248
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:59,792
I bet you are.

249
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,559
I am. I don't know what happened.

250
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:03,561
You were kicking and I couldn't hold on...

251
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:05,197
Not as sorry as I am.

252
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:08,473
There were rats coming at my face.

253
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,772
They were running at me too, Trish.

254
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,849
I feel really bad. Are you okay?

255
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:23,425
Thank you so much, by the way.
Thank you for this.

256
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,761
Trisha Jenner,
coming through in the clutch.

257
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:28,929
Thank you.

258
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,592
You were the one who wanted to come
and have a little adventure.

259
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:35,966
Shut up.

260
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,375
How the hell are you gonna
get out of there?

261
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,516
Darry?

262
00:21:57,782 --> 00:21:58,920
What?

263
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,396
Darry?

264
00:22:17,902 --> 00:22:19,506
Say it isn't so.

265
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:33,159
Did I hear you talking?

266
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Darry, who in the holy hell
are you talking to down there?
I found our body.
- You what?
- I found our...

267
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,741
What?

268
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:23,631
Darry?

269
00:24:26,864 --> 00:24:30,004
Say something.
You're scaring the shit out of me!

270
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:35,113
Darry, tell me what's going on!

271
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,445
What?

272
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:42,754
We gotta get out of here.

273
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:45,353
No, let's stay and feed the birds.

274
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,424
Get help.

275
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,689
Get help, Trish.

276
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:52,323
What are you looking at?

277
00:24:52,423 --> 00:24:55,460
Get out to the road
and find somebody who can help.

278
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,528
How are you gonna get out of there?

279
00:24:57,628 --> 00:25:01,405
This is some kind of basement, right,
for the church?

280
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,404
You don't think
I'm going in there, do you?

281
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,940
Get out to the road,
flag down anyone you see...

282
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,576
tell them to get the cops out here
right away.

283
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,045
There's gotta be a way out.
I'm gonna find it.

284
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,453
And Trish...

285
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,449
if you see that old truck coming...

286
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:22,361
you get back to this pipe,
you holler down as loud as you can.

287
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:26,094
You just had to say that, right?

288
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

289
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

290
00:31:37,294 --> 00:31:39,570
God damn it, Darry!

291
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,277
You asshole!

292
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:52,847
Darry?

293
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:14,202
Would you please just say something?

294
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,956
Darry, you're scaring the shit out of me!

295
00:32:35,185 --> 00:32:36,823
We have to stop.

296
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,394
Did you hear me?

297
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:46,564
Darry?

298
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,371
She did lose her head.

299
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:54,038
Darla lost her head just like they said.

300
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:01,519
And you know what he did, Trish?

301
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:05,284
You know what he did for her?

302
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,994
He sewed it back on.

303
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,136
He sewed it right back on.

304
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,410
You gonna make a phone call?

305
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:02,540
Throw some water on yourself.

306
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,382
You look like
you just crawled out of a sewer.

307
00:34:24,828 --> 00:34:26,364
He's going back.

308
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,480
He's going back. Come on!

309
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:40,750
Excuse me.

310
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,922
Excuse me, we need help.

311
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:50,195
I need you to please call the police.

312
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:52,496
The police?

313
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,301
We need help now, please!

314
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:08,040
Just go tell them what you saw
so we can get out of here, okay?

315
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,977
Come on, brat!

316
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:15,322
I mean it. I need you to hold it together.

317
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:19,785
Look at me, Darry.

318
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:23,994
I'm so scared, Trish.

319
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:28,602
I am so scared.

320
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm scared, too, all right?
He's gonna get back to that church...
and he's gonna know that we were there.

321
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:55,026
Are you gonna get that?

322
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:01,759
- Yeah, hello.
- Have you seen the cats yet?

323
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,873
- You and your brother.
- Me and my brother?

324
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,870
You and Darry.
I saw you with lots of cats.

325
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:11,568
Who the hell is this?
How do you know Darry?

326
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:12,903
Who is this?

327
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:15,739
Darry?
You know the cats I'm talking about?

328
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:16,907
Who is this?

329
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:18,709
You have a torn shirt, right?

330
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,447
And a bloody hand.

331
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:24,314
Shirt's torn just above
a small rose tattoo...

332
00:36:24,414 --> 00:36:25,893
on your stomach.

333
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,161
Who is this?

334
00:36:29,653 --> 00:36:31,021
How the hell do you know us?

335
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:33,362
You found its house of pain.

336
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,059
The what?

337
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,227
Those bodies down there...

338
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:39,530
that's what it likes to call it...

339
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,769
its house of pain.

340
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,635
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

341
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:48,672
I don't know if it's a demon or a devil...

342
00:36:48,772 --> 00:36:51,275
or just some hungry thing...

343
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,548
from some dark place in time.

344
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:56,080
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

345
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,821
I just know it's not gonna stop
coming after you...

346
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,786
or anyone else it wants to.

347
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,694
Once it has the scent
of something it likes...

348
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,762
it can't stop.

349
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,035
- Is what...
- What is she saying?

350
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,007
I saw that awful truck, too.

351
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,202
With the license plate.

352
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:19,903
"Beating You?"

353
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:22,279
The license plate on its truck.

354
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:23,774
Right, "Beating You"?

355
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:25,512
No, think about it.

356
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,613
Think about it, for Christ's sake.

357
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:31,849
Hold on. I need you to listen to this.

358
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:36,386
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those peepers?

359
00:37:36,486 --> 00:37:40,332
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those eyes?"

360
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,527
Okay.

361
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:45,800
You hear that song, you run.

362
00:37:47,297 --> 00:37:48,970
And I mean run.

363
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:52,239
'Cause that song means
something terrible for you.

364
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,584
Something so terrible
you couldn't dream of it...

365
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,616
not in your worst,
most terrible nightmare.

366
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,547
Fuck you, lady!

367
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:04,548
Darry.

368
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:15,430
Darry?

369
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,100
Hello?

370
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:23,172
Let's talk with the cops
and get the hell out of here.

371
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:42,726
Maybe you should've left out the part
about that phone call.

372
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:52,967
It just sounds too much like a bad dream.

373
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,840
Everything I said I saw, I saw.

374
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,640
What, you think I bumped my head
down there or something?

375
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,008
I didn't say that.

376
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:07,088
You believe me, right?

377
00:39:08,712 --> 00:39:09,747
Right?

378
00:39:12,115 --> 00:39:15,062
Look me in the eye
and tell me you believe me.

379
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,930
Look me right in the eye right now,
you tell me you believe everything I said!

380
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:24,828
We're running the plates...

381
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,102
and we've got some people
on their way out to the old church.

382
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:31,302
These kids you saw on that wall,
who were they again?

383
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,846
Darla Cleeway and Kenny...

384
00:39:35,672 --> 00:39:36,640
Brandon.

385
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,077
Found their car all smashed up
about 20 years ago.

386
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,623
- Am I remembering this right?
- Yeah.

387
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:45,756
Those bodies would be
nothing but bones by now.

388
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:51,595
You said they still had skin on them
and he had a ring on his finger.

389
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:53,267
What are you saying?

390
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,698
I told you,
I grabbed one of them like this.

391
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:58,295
And it was hard, like petrified wood.

392
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:00,397
Like he preserved them or something.

393
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:03,367
He's got them all stitched together
like some kind of quilt.

394
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,904
- I'm just trying to get all the facts here.
- And I told you the facts!

395
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,239
This guy drives an old brown truck...

396
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:11,141
and it nearly killed us.

397
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:14,120
We saw him throw a body down a pipe...

398
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:16,880
that dumps into the cellar
of that old church.

399
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,156
This guy must have 500,
maybe 600 bodies down there...

400
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:22,728
and I've seen them!

401
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:27,233
Stuck up on the walls...

402
00:40:27,357 --> 00:40:31,328
like some psycho version
of the Sistine Chapel!

403
00:40:31,895 --> 00:40:34,431
What, you don't believe me?

404
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:37,637
Drive out to the old church
if you think I'm lying.

405
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,438
No one's saying you're lying.

406
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,344
Good, because I'm not lying!

407
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:42,973
Look at this from my point of view.

408
00:40:43,106 --> 00:40:45,746
This is a pretty big story
you're laying on us here.

409
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,791
That's your car
out at the pumps, isn't it?

410
00:41:03,493 --> 00:41:05,973
Bunch of folks saw him from the window.

411
00:41:06,596 --> 00:41:08,701
The man there at your car.

412
00:41:11,868 --> 00:41:14,474
He was standing there at your car...

413
00:41:14,971 --> 00:41:17,281
sniffin' that laundry...

414
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:21,718
holding big handfuls of it under his nose.

415
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,456
Looked like he was liking it, too.

416
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:30,658
Which way he run off, Binky?

417
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,100
Still think I bumped my head?

418
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,242
He had time to get to the church,
then back here.

419
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,778
This guy is after us!

420
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:48,779
And he's after us
'cause he knows what we saw.

421
00:41:52,742 --> 00:41:55,279
And now he even knows my name.

422
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,863
Central, this is 037. Come back.

423
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:07,192
You interested in a hand print?

424
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:09,303
037, go ahead, please.

425
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,942
037, this is Central.

426
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,806
Go ahead.

427
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,449
You can dust that, right? Get a print?

428
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:31,456
Looks like somebody already did.

429
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,693
037, what's going on out there?

430
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,359
037, I need a response, please.

431
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,065
There is definitely some
weird shit going on.

432
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:47,531
This is Central.
037, that is an affirmative.

433
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,703
We should all just get in the car and go.
We should go.

434
00:42:50,867 --> 00:42:52,369
What is your situation?

435
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:01,015
037, please respond.

436
00:43:08,718 --> 00:43:11,790
How'd he get to the church
and back to the diner so fast?

437
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,496
What the hell was he doing
with your clothes?

438
00:43:18,328 --> 00:43:20,831
He drives fast, but not that fast.

439
00:43:24,267 --> 00:43:27,407
Maybe he can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

440
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,309
He'd have to be superhuman.
Otherwise, the smell would've killed him.

441
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:35,856
Please come back, 037,
out there on East 9.

442
00:43:36,112 --> 00:43:38,490
Central, this is 037. Go ahead.

443
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,518
You sure that's not a couple of
little pyromaniacs...

444
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:43,598
you're escorting out there?

445
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,297
Go ahead.

446
00:43:45,622 --> 00:43:47,499
This old church is on fire.

447
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:50,331
I'm talking burning out of control.

448
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:53,530
I'm up to my ass in Fire and Rescue,
but I can tell you...

449
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,110
no one's going inside this thing
for a long time.

450
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:58,040
Incest capital of the world.

451
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,215
Don't be such a snot.

452
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:07,149
Don't tell me you actually like him.

453
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,715
Who?

454
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,148
Please.

455
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,817
I thought the waitress had dialed
the wrong number.

456
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,397
The guy looked like a strip-o-gram cop.

457
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,070
Like the missing link.

458
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:26,263
I wanna bring him to my Anthro class
for show and tell.

459
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:27,501
In sports, the national...

460
00:44:34,804 --> 00:44:35,772
"Jeepers..."

461
00:44:35,872 --> 00:44:38,241
- That's the song!
- What's the matter with you?

462
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:39,445
The words are the same.

463
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:42,249
"Creepshow,
where did you get those eyes..."

464
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:43,780
What is the matter with you?

465
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,759
That's the same song
that lady on the phone was playing!

466
00:44:47,784 --> 00:44:51,425
These kids say the vehicle chased them
doing over 100, go ahead.

467
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:54,795
A preliminary came back on that dust
you took off the car handle.

468
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:56,259
It's dead skin.

469
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:58,168
Long dead. That's why it was powder.

470
00:44:58,395 --> 00:44:59,965
Say what?

471
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,006
That's it! The words are the same, listen!

472
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,409
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those weepers."

473
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,511
Hold on, Central, the sky is falling.

474
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,299
She was playing this song to us,
and she said if we heard it...

475
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:31,805
This is it.

476
00:46:23,513 --> 00:46:25,117
037, come in.

477
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,789
Are you okay in there?

478
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,572
037, this is Central. Come in.

479
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:54,584
Trish?

480
00:46:54,944 --> 00:46:56,048
I said hello!

481
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:58,659
Get back in the car.

482
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,488
Central, this is 04...

483
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,930
Get back in the car, Trish!

484
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:23,944
What is that?

485
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,879
I'm not seeing this.

486
00:48:49,325 --> 00:48:50,929
What is he doing?

487
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,244
Go.

488
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,974
- I'm trying.
- Go, go, go!

489
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,085
- Go, go, go!
- I'm trying!

490
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:56,601
Come on, you're gonna kill us!

491
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,062
I mean it, slow down!

492
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:01,136
Slow down!

493
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,275
No way.

494
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,683
- There's a phone.
- So?

495
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:17,717
- So you just told me to stop.
- I didn't say, "Stop." I said, "Slow down."

496
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,216
- How far's the next town?
- You mean the next phone?

497
00:50:20,316 --> 00:50:22,990
It's pretty god damn far.
You wanna wait to find out?

498
00:50:43,339 --> 00:50:46,479
Come on, Trish, look at this place.
Let's just keep going.

499
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:48,718
I mean it, come on.

500
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:51,482
- You don't wanna get help?
- Help from who?

501
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,182
We'll just use the phone.

502
00:50:53,282 --> 00:50:54,918
- And call who?
- I don't know.

503
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:56,719
- And tell them what?
- I don't know.

504
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,493
"Hey, bum-fuck police,
I'm being chased by a guy...

505
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,392
"who pulls tongues out of
severed heads with his teeth.

506
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,403
"Is there a special extension for that?"

507
00:51:04,794 --> 00:51:05,829
Come on.

508
00:51:07,263 --> 00:51:09,743
Christ, do you think
they even have a phone?

509
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,870
I'm guessing no phone and a lot of guns.

510
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:14,308
Who are you?

511
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,060
I said, "Who are you?"

512
00:51:29,585 --> 00:51:33,260
Patricia Jenner. This is my brother Darry.

513
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,669
- What do you want?
- A telephone?

514
00:51:38,861 --> 00:51:40,238
I don't have one.

515
00:51:42,031 --> 00:51:44,136
I say we keep driving till we see people.

516
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,176
What do you think she is?

517
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,883
What you need a phone for if I had one?

518
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,418
I need to call
the Pertwilla County Police.

519
00:51:54,043 --> 00:51:55,283
Pertwilla?

520
00:51:55,678 --> 00:51:58,921
That's one county back.
You're in Poho County.

521
00:51:59,148 --> 00:52:02,095
Then Poho Police.
But I need to call someone.

522
00:52:02,952 --> 00:52:06,623
Don't even think about
bringing the cops out here...

523
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:09,033
with their zoning crap.

524
00:52:10,259 --> 00:52:14,571
They try to tell me
how many cats people can have.

525
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:18,840
I'll have as many cats as I wanna have.

526
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,204
You can tell them that for me.

527
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,409
Please, someone's been killed.

528
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:29,514
Killed, you say?

529
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:31,856
Yeah, a policeman.

530
00:52:32,281 --> 00:52:34,488
Holy Jesus, I thought...

531
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,588
I thought you meant one of my babies.

532
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:41,597
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Let's get out of here.

533
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,067
You can call the Sheriff's station,
just don't give them this address.

534
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:52,512
And tell them to go out on the
interstate where they ought to be.

535
00:52:53,002 --> 00:52:55,278
My babies don't like strangers.

536
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,310
How many babies do you have?

537
00:52:59,475 --> 00:53:00,783
More than a couple.

538
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:04,324
We've gotta get out of here right now.

539
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:12,397
Tell me this happens all the time.

540
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,173
Holy shit.

541
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:50,766
You kids got anyone else with you?

542
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,038
What?

543
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,383
That's not my scarecrow.

544
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:18,892
You got 10 seconds...

545
00:54:19,088 --> 00:54:22,001
to get your ass out of my yard!

546
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,370
And don't think I'm gonna tell you twice.

547
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:35,373
- Get the hell away from him.
- What are you doing, Trish?

548
00:54:37,673 --> 00:54:40,085
Get the hell away from him!

549
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:51,487
Come on. Let's go.

550
00:54:51,587 --> 00:54:53,623
No. Don't you go up there.

551
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,558
- Listen to him!
- We gotta get out of here!

552
00:54:55,658 --> 00:54:58,400
What the hell did you bring into my house?

553
00:55:01,497 --> 00:55:03,170
Get out of here.

554
00:55:03,532 --> 00:55:06,741
Get away from my babies,
you sons of bitches!

555
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'll blow your fucking head off!

556
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,034
Hello?

557
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Something's wrong.
- Don't say that!
What do you want me to say?
The gears are sticking!
- Unstick them, Trish!
- You're gonna break it!

558
00:57:05,154 --> 00:57:07,725
- It's stuck in reverse!
- Go in reverse!

559
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,689
- What do we do?
- Hit him.

560
00:57:34,183 --> 00:57:35,628
Hit him, Trish.

561
00:57:36,185 --> 00:57:37,163
Hard.

562
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,067
Do it!

563
00:58:13,689 --> 00:58:15,191
What the hell is that thing?

564
00:58:25,534 --> 00:58:27,445
What the hell are you doing?

565
00:58:29,438 --> 00:58:31,349
Come on, you son of a bitch.

566
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,882
That's right,
walk that ugly face right over here.

567
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,620
Come on.

568
00:58:39,982 --> 00:58:40,960
Come on!

569
00:59:04,373 --> 00:59:06,011
Do you think he's dead?

570
00:59:06,575 --> 00:59:08,418
They never are.

571
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,043
Enough.

572
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,927
Let's get out of here.

573
01:00:55,517 --> 01:00:56,723
Trish.

574
01:01:02,024 --> 01:01:04,664
I don't know how much further
this car is gonna go.

575
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,465
Not far enough.

576
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:54,277
Roach.

577
01:01:55,077 --> 01:01:56,954
What are we boosting tonight?

578
01:01:57,646 --> 01:02:01,253
Why don't you come over here
and find out, Big Daddy?

579
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:04,160
'76 Chevy Nova?

580
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,056
Anyone tell you, for a car thief,
you got taste for shit?

581
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,397
Would you tell Dad
to stop shouting, please?

582
01:02:09,591 --> 01:02:10,899
Mom!

583
01:02:14,396 --> 01:02:16,205
I understand that, Mother.

584
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:18,343
I'm just trying to tell you where we are.

585
01:02:19,601 --> 01:02:22,707
Standing right here.
I told you, we're both okay.

586
01:02:24,573 --> 01:02:28,919
It's the Poho County Sheriff's Station
about 20 miles outside Pertwilla.

587
01:02:30,245 --> 01:02:32,987
Because we'll be home
before you could get here.

588
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:38,060
We don't wanna wait here, Mom.
We just wanna get the hell out of here.

589
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,294
Mom, just let us get home, okay?

590
01:02:42,057 --> 01:02:44,697
We don't wanna be out here
any more than you do.

591
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,300
Me, too.

592
01:02:47,629 --> 01:02:49,836
I'll talk to you in a few hours.

593
01:02:55,003 --> 01:02:56,209
Dad.

594
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:58,110
Thought I wrecked the car?

595
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,142
She's trailer trash.

596
01:03:00,242 --> 01:03:01,944
- Pig fucker.
- Booger eater.

597
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:03,022
Trisha?

598
01:03:05,814 --> 01:03:07,157
Trisha and Darry, right?

599
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:09,227
Jez, what are you doing here?

600
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,261
Excuse me, Jezelle?

601
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:13,859
Darry.

602
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:16,058
Darry Jenner.

603
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:20,262
- Jezelle Gay Hartman. How do you do?
- Come on. They've been through a lot.

604
01:03:20,362 --> 01:03:21,664
- Trisha.
- Goddamn it, Jez.

605
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:24,967
I really need to talk to you,
if you could just spare me a minute.

606
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,703
Jezelle likes to think she's
the resident psychic here.

607
01:03:27,803 --> 01:03:29,339
She helped us on a missing persons...

608
01:03:29,471 --> 01:03:31,840
Could I just talk to these kids by myself?

609
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,677
You go home, turn off that police scanner,
and go to bed.

610
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,379
You got missing persons
and a fire in the next county.

611
01:03:37,479 --> 01:03:38,947
Go do something useful.

612
01:03:39,047 --> 01:03:41,288
I mean it, now, leave them alone.

613
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,630
You don't have to believe I'm psychic.

614
01:03:44,186 --> 01:03:46,723
You don't have to believe a word I say.

615
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,602
But I've come a very long way to see you.

616
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:50,826
You know...

617
01:03:50,926 --> 01:03:53,930
I'm not sure we should be talking
to anybody right now.

618
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:55,130
Let's go.

619
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,642
You found all those bodies...

620
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,043
down in that cellar.

621
01:04:01,703 --> 01:04:03,011
I saw them, too.

622
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,318
How?

623
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,553
Dreamed it.

624
01:04:09,344 --> 01:04:11,585
I dream a lot of things.

625
01:04:13,615 --> 01:04:15,288
You see the cats yet?

626
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:19,456
I saw you with all those cats, too.

627
01:04:20,322 --> 01:04:21,665
The diner.

628
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:23,961
That was you. You called us.

629
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:27,266
Will you excuse me for a second?

630
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:31,603
- Darry, I need to talk...
- I need you to listen and not talk.

631
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,471
Truth be, I'd be lying if I said I knew
that telling you this would do any good.

632
01:04:36,705 --> 01:04:37,979
Any good?

633
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,880
What does that mean?

634
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,547
Every 23rd spring...

635
01:04:43,712 --> 01:04:46,022
for 23 days...

636
01:04:47,449 --> 01:04:50,760
it gets to eat.

637
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:56,828
Eat?

638
01:04:57,125 --> 01:05:00,129
You know what it eats,
and don't you make me tell you.

639
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,970
You think I like having this in my head?

640
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:05,974
I don't.

641
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:09,341
I don't like knowing this
and not knowing why I do.

642
01:05:10,105 --> 01:05:11,607
You said it eats?

643
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:16,788
Only certain things...

644
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:19,882
from certain people.

645
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,250
Just get away from her.

646
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,388
It eats lungs so it can breathe...

647
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:30,693
and eyes so it can see.

648
01:05:32,661 --> 01:05:35,073
It all becomes a part of it.

649
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:39,272
Whatever it eats becomes a part of it.

650
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,813
It dresses like a man...

651
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:50,756
but only to hide that it's not.

652
01:06:01,623 --> 01:06:04,536
You hurt it out there on the road...

653
01:06:05,694 --> 01:06:08,436
but only as much as it can be hurt.

654
01:06:10,332 --> 01:06:12,312
'Cause it can keep on eating...

655
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:14,975
till it isn't hurt no more.

656
01:06:20,275 --> 01:06:23,654
You've got something it likes, one of you.

657
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:29,123
And it's not gonna stop chasing you
till it knows which one.

658
01:06:31,453 --> 01:06:32,591
How?

659
01:06:32,721 --> 01:06:34,098
Never mind how.

660
01:06:34,222 --> 01:06:36,930
How does it find out,
by running people off the road?

661
01:06:37,392 --> 01:06:39,167
It needs to scare you.

662
01:06:39,494 --> 01:06:43,067
There's something in fear,
something it can smell.

663
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:47,202
Something that tells it
if there's anything inside someone...

664
01:06:47,302 --> 01:06:50,977
that it might like.

665
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:56,187
You're telling us this thing
is out driving down the highway...

666
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,814
trying to freak people out
so it can smell them?

667
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:01,793
Christ, Darry!
Why are we standing here with her?

668
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:06,398
Hello?

669
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:09,263
We got lights and phones out up here!

670
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:12,599
Would somebody talk to me?

671
01:07:12,794 --> 01:07:13,772
It's gone.

672
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:17,108
We ran it over
till there was nothing left.

673
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,013
What the hell,
have we got emergency lights or what?

674
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:32,214
People, we're going into
a lockdown situation.

675
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:33,982
That means everybody sit tight.

676
01:07:34,082 --> 01:07:36,790
Don't move unless
somebody wearing a badge tells you.

677
01:07:36,985 --> 01:07:39,124
We pounded it to dust.

678
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:41,831
We watched it blow the fuck away.

679
01:07:44,426 --> 01:07:49,000
I think it's eaten too many hearts
for its own to ever stop.

680
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:54,543
Heads up, gentlemen.

681
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:57,316
Let me see some skin.

682
01:07:57,539 --> 01:07:59,348
Are you in a coma, buddy?

683
01:08:00,742 --> 01:08:02,311
What is wrong with you, man?

684
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,780
We have a blackout.
That means emergency head count.

685
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,985
Hey, lower bunk, let me see some skin.

686
01:08:08,316 --> 01:08:10,227
That is special. I love you, too.

687
01:08:10,485 --> 01:08:13,227
Heads up. Move it, down there.

688
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,696
Thank you for joining us.

689
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:18,133
Show me some skin, that's it.

690
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,806
Heads up, gentlemen.

691
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,756
Okay, you two.
You kids wanna come with me?

692
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:22,758
We're putting you in a holding room.

693
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:25,668
You can't do that! He finds you in here!

694
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,963
He finds you hiding in a room!

695
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:28,973
You, too.

696
01:09:29,097 --> 01:09:33,773
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those peepers?"

697
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:36,472
- We heard it in the car hours ago.
- No.

698
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:39,082
It's playing on an old phonograph.

699
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,810
Escort Jezelle here
to the big blue Winnebago...

700
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:43,879
she's no doubt blocking the driveway with.

701
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,314
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those eyes?"

702
01:09:46,414 --> 01:09:47,983
I swear I will lock you up, Jez.

703
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:51,155
I hear it playing
while one of you is screaming.

704
01:09:51,286 --> 01:09:53,221
Screaming down in the dark somewhere.

705
01:09:53,321 --> 01:09:55,301
Screaming the last scream
you'll ever scream!

706
01:09:55,423 --> 01:09:57,232
Goddamn it, knock it off!

707
01:09:57,793 --> 01:10:00,239
What exactly are you doing here?

708
01:10:00,495 --> 01:10:04,170
Up top? Anybody on ground level?
We have an 11-99.

709
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,834
I repeat, an 11-99.

710
01:10:05,934 --> 01:10:07,402
This is Tubbs, go ahead.

711
01:10:07,502 --> 01:10:09,914
We got a situation down here, Sarge.

712
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:14,713
It's headed towards you,
up the rear stairs. You copy?

713
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:16,947
Coming up the rear stairwell.

714
01:10:17,078 --> 01:10:18,580
Stay here.

715
01:10:21,716 --> 01:10:24,356
I'm gonna get you out of here.

716
01:10:24,619 --> 01:10:26,223
Come on, I said!

717
01:10:46,474 --> 01:10:48,110
Somebody down there talk to me.

718
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,588
We have one inmate and one officer down.

719
01:10:50,712 --> 01:10:52,248
Ramirez, he's hurt bad.

720
01:10:52,447 --> 01:10:54,825
The son of a bitch
tried to take a bite out of him.

721
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,258
He what?

722
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:01,490
This guy is wearing something.

723
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,196
'Cause I'm a son of a bitch,
but we cannot take him down.

724
01:11:04,492 --> 01:11:06,261
What do you mean, "wearing something"?

725
01:11:06,361 --> 01:11:08,272
You'd think I was crazy if I told you.

726
01:11:08,463 --> 01:11:11,842
This is about the weirdest fucking
body armor you've ever seen.

727
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:15,304
Where is he?

728
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:18,111
- Talk.
- He's gone.

729
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,818
He's gone, Sarge.
This guy just climbed up the fucking wall.

730
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:25,219
You are not making
one goddamn bit of sense.

731
01:11:28,316 --> 01:11:31,229
You can put me in a straitjacket,
but this fucker is gone.

732
01:11:31,586 --> 01:11:34,157
Gone? What the hell you talking about?

733
01:11:34,656 --> 01:11:36,892
This guy's a real
mover and a shaker, Sarge.

734
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:38,903
We just lost him on the stairwell.

735
01:11:39,294 --> 01:11:41,103
I can't see! I can't see!

736
01:11:41,296 --> 01:11:44,140
He's heading right up to you. Copy?

737
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

738
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:19,905
Shit.

739
01:13:21,062 --> 01:13:22,439
This is your way out?

740
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:25,110
These must lock automatically
if the power's out.

741
01:13:25,633 --> 01:13:27,374
You didn't know that?

742
01:13:27,535 --> 01:13:29,304
I don't dream everything!

743
01:13:29,404 --> 01:13:31,611
This isn't everything!
This is our way out!

744
01:13:31,773 --> 01:13:35,949
It's not like watching a movie, honey.
There are parts missing sometimes.

745
01:13:43,618 --> 01:13:45,757
We have to get out of here now.

746
01:13:47,522 --> 01:13:49,763
There's no other way except the front...

747
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:56,171
The front door is out.
Why don't you dream up something useful?

748
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:59,567
I thought if you knew what I saw,
maybe you could change it.

749
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:01,704
Why the hell do you think I'm here?

750
01:14:07,742 --> 01:14:08,914
You know.

751
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:12,617
Don't you?

752
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,888
You knew when you walked in.

753
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:23,361
You know who it wants.

754
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:26,861
- You know what it wants.
- I've dreamed this.

755
01:14:26,961 --> 01:14:28,596
You know what's gonna happen.

756
01:14:28,696 --> 01:14:32,610
You will run up the stairs and hide,
but I don't know what happens to me.

757
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,405
Jeepers Creepers.

758
01:14:34,702 --> 01:14:36,648
Jeepers Creepers, right?

759
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:38,811
Who?

760
01:14:39,841 --> 01:14:43,288
Who hears Jeepers Creepers
while screaming in the dark?

761
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:54,058
Are they ever wrong?

762
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,363
I don't believe you.

763
01:14:57,792 --> 01:14:59,060
You don't understand.

764
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,697
Your dreams, are they ever wrong?

765
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,102
You go to hell.

766
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I said, "You don't understand."
Are they ever wrong?
Are your dreams every wrong?
She doesn't know.
She doesn't know shit.

767
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:19,216
Get upstairs!

768
01:15:19,914 --> 01:15:21,018
Now!

769
01:15:28,523 --> 01:15:31,003
Our Father, who art in heaven...

770
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
hallowed be Thy...

771
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

772
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:44,526
What in the holy name of God?

773
01:18:50,725 --> 01:18:52,033
Take me.

774
01:18:54,829 --> 01:18:57,465
You don't want him.

775
01:18:57,565 --> 01:19:01,012
Whatever you want,
you can take it from me.

776
01:19:05,573 --> 01:19:07,143
You don't want Darry.

777
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:09,615
No, you don't.

778
01:19:10,511 --> 01:19:12,013
Don't you be a hero!

779
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:14,850
I have everything the same inside.
You take me!

780
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:19,263
You hear me? You take me.
You fucking let him go!

781
01:19:27,628 --> 01:19:29,665
Please, let him go.

782
01:19:29,797 --> 01:19:31,970
Trish, please don't do this.

783
01:19:32,133 --> 01:19:33,806
Just think for a second.

784
01:19:34,001 --> 01:19:36,106
I won't fight you. You can take me.

785
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:38,216
I'm stronger. You want me.

786
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:50,788
Drop him.

787
01:19:52,653 --> 01:19:54,599
Let him go and take me.

788
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:58,292
You let him go!

789
01:20:09,737 --> 01:20:11,444
Darry!

790
01:21:10,598 --> 01:21:13,306
Your folks just pulled up outside.

791
01:21:24,879 --> 01:21:26,984
You never answered him.

792
01:21:31,018 --> 01:21:33,089
Are your dreams ever wrong?

793
01:21:35,089 --> 01:21:39,401
Darry screaming in the dark
while that song is playing.

794
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:41,941
What did that mean?

795
01:21:43,898 --> 01:21:45,878
What did you really see?

796
01:21:47,768 --> 01:21:49,907
I'm just a crazy old woman.

797
01:21:50,938 --> 01:21:53,578
You ask anyone around here,
they'll tell you.

798
01:21:54,408 --> 01:21:56,115
That's all I am.

799
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:58,179
Just a crazy old woman...

800
01:21:58,279 --> 01:22:00,316
with crazy dreams.
