It's another twenty

anywhere else.

00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:53,772
Cool.

106
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,208
Well, I could give
you a catheter.

might be on it's way.

I'm just glad the
doc stuck around.

That fire really did a
number on this place.

130
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,899
And I can't afford to be
driving her into the city

131
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,834
every time that
kid gets fidgety.

132
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,102

Easy. Breathe.

00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,220
Okay.

142
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,556
I'm not gonna miss this.

143
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,257
You gonna be able to
handle him, Richard?

144
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,626
Your friend here's
had quite a trauma.

145
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,562
Well, not that we have any
ID bracelets left, but for

146
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,996
the record his name is James.

147
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,264
How bad is he?

148
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,966
Well, he's not been
very cooperative.

149
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,935
The sedative will help us
determine exactly what his

150
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:35,106
condition is, but our
resources are limited here.

151
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,709
Everything's been
packed up for the move.

any stranger to needles.

Where'd you find this guy?

154
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,686
He fucking bled on me.

Kim, I know getting
transferred over here

156
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,659
wasn't your first choice,
but you're supposed to be

157
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,328
boxing up files.

158
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,197
No, there are things
called computers now.

that stain out.

Whatever, fuck.

169
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,667
I can do my own laundry.

170
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,336
Well! Look at you.

171
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,074
Brought you uh, coffee.

172
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,010
Nice.

173
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,411
I was looking for that.

174
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:49,848
It's mine now so don't
you get any ideas.

175
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,249
Right.

It's good to see you.

00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,430
Uh... I'm sorry.

180
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,798
Am I interrupting something?

181
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,233
- No, no.
- No. No, no, no.

182
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:11,436
I'm just gonna go make sure Bev
hasn't murdered my intern.

183
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,204
I'll see you.

Our guest is out for now.

186
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,147
He's not badly hurt, but
it will be a while before

187
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,715
you can talk to him.

188

there's nothing worse than

I was a mess.

come back from that.

No, no, no, no.

Look, it's not

This trooper's probably
gonna wanna talk to you.

No, no, no.

So what happened?

290
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,562
They told me you found
the two of them together.

00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,497
Uh, yeah.

292
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:44,202
He was dead when I arrived
and she came at me with a

00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,294
What about him?

297
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:54,212
We got a major bloodbath about
twenty miles north of here.

298
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,081
Looks like he tore the
place up like a butcher shop.

00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,483
Uh, yeah.

300
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,185
We looked him over and
most of the blood on his

301
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,720
body was not his.

302
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,356
Well he has a long list
of drug related priors.

303
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,759
So I think he gave
your nurse something.

304
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,528
I've got him cuffed to the
bed for the time being.

You know, Carter, your
dad was a stand up cop.

I wonder what he'd think
if he saw this shit show.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hey.

00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,350
Okay, maybe don't try
to get up just yet.

381
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,519
What happened out there?

382
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,856
Just give him a second.

383
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,726
It looks like they've got
the place surrounded.

384
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:43,127
They're not trying to get in.

385
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,028
Who are they?

00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,496
I don't know.

387
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,899
I wasn't able to
get through. You?

No.

389
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,503
We should move
everyone back inside.

390
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:55,540
Who knows what they want.

391
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,576
No, maybe we can barricade
the doors or uh, you know,

392
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,678
get out some other way.

00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,800
We didn't do anything to you.

562
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,202
I have a girl back there
who's about to give birth

563
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,104
and I need to get
her some place safe.

564
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,372
Are you fucking kidding?

565
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:10,107
Have you had a
look outside lady?

566
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,009
There's nowhere to go.

567
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,577
You can hear those
horns for miles.

568
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,213
There is something
calling them all here.

569
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:17,981
Okay, what is that?
Who are they? What just...

570
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,817
How the fuck should I know?

571
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,452
- Go ask them!
- It's okay, it's okay.

572
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:25,989
All I know is that that
thing woke up once already

573
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,592
and I don't wanna be around
when it happens again.

574
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,398
[door opens]

575
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:49,513
Oh, there's a problem.

576
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,848
Maggie.

577
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,884
I didn't know what to do.

578
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,385
Okay.

579
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:56,887
Hey, sweetie.

580
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:02,059
Are we leaving?

581
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:04,394
No, not just yet.

582
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:16,173
Would you put that out?

583
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:17,908
Al.

584
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,310
- What, this?
- Yeah.

585
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,979
Put it out.

586
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:23,981
Okay.

587
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,982
I think we all should
just remain calm.

588
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,284
Bullshit.

589
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:29,419
We should've been
out of here already.

590
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,088
You people need to wake up.

591
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,357
Or what?

592
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,560
You think you'll stand a
chance if there's another

593
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,295
one of those things out there?

594
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,197
- Okay.
- Will you, huh?

595
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,098
- Okay, okay.
- Who's gonna stop it? Grandpa?

596
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:44,034
The teenage fucking slut.

597
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,435
Oh! Come on now!

598
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,136
Whoa, whoa!

599
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,337
Come on.

600
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,505
We're gonna die.

601
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:49,740
[crying]

602
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,974
No, we're not gonna die.

603
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:52,075
You're gonna die.

604
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,175
I'm not gonna let that happen.

605
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,311
Okay.

606
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,950
Okay.

607
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,621
I don't know what the fuck
you think you're trying to do.

608
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:05,923
Okay? Just calm down.

609
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,224
He's upsetting her
and that is not good.

610
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,692
- I need you to stay calm.
- Okay.

611
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:11,161
Can you please tell me
what is going on over there?

612
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,330
Her contractions are still
spread out, but she's

613
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,565
having abdominal pain
which is a bad sign.

614
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,401
Okay, I don't know
what that means.

615
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:18,969
What does that mean?

616
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,536
That means that
we can't move her.

617
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:23,507
It can make things much worse.

618
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,609
Also the last thing I need
is to be performing a

619
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,278
cesarean in the middle of
this, but I have nothing

620
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,281
here to help her and if I don't
do anything the baby could die.

621
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,383
I need to go to the
med supply room.

622
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:35,218
So I'll go.

623
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,689
Alone? No, no, no,
that's out of the question.

624
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:40,457
I'm not asking.

625
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,559
We need to handle this now.

626
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:43,427
Alright.

627
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:44,979
Okay, look.

628
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,530
We have no idea
what is out there.

629
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:48,465
We have no way of
defending ourselves.

630
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,634
Plus these two fucking
psychos now think that

631
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,735
we're hostage.

632
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:54,371
I'm doing this.

633
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:57,040
You're not. You're not.
You're not even...

634
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,443
If this is because of the
baby then you need to get

635
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:00,677
a fucking mental check.

636
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:04,314
Jesus Christ, this
is not about us.

637
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,684
That girl, if she
suffers an abruption

638
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,353
then her baby will die.

639
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:12,222
If I try to take it out
of her, and I don't use

640
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:15,092
anesthetic then she
could die of shock.

641
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:18,061
Daniel, look at me.

642
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,533
Okay, fine.
Fuck it, fuck it.

643
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,569
Uh...

644
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:27,504
Okay, but you're
not going alone.

645
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,140
You have to promise and wait
for me, okay? You promise?

646
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:32,442
- Okay.
- Alright.

647
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:41,284
May I approach?

648
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,557
The girl's not doing well
and neither is the baby so

649
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:53,030
we need to go and get
some things to help her.

650
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:55,265
What do you want from us?

651
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:58,335
Well I have a shotgun
in my cruiser.

652
00:33:58,337 --> 00:33:59,403
I have ammunition.

653
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,171
[laughs]

654
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:03,440
We just fought our way in here.

655
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:06,176
I'm not gonna just
stroll back out again.

656
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:11,081
Okay, but as far as I can
tell we're all the same boat.

657
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,817
You've got a rifle without
any bullets and a couple

658
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:16,386
of fucking fire axes.

659
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,438
I just...

660
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:20,489
it's close and we
can do it fast.

661
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,526
[sighs]

662
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:28,598
Alright, but we're not
risking our lives for you.

663
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,269
We get that gun, it's ours.

664
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,171
Oh, absolutely.

665
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:37,107
Abso-fucking-lutley.

666
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,176
Okay.

667
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,825
I thought you said it was close.

668
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:56,693
What the hell?

669
00:34:57,463 --> 00:34:59,696
It's still out there.

670
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:03,433
Yeah, but what are
they waiting for?

671
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,435
Let's just make this quick.

672
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,506
Shotgun's locked
on the front seat.

673
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:13,276
I gotta release it, but...

674
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,712
you get all the ammo
out of the trunk.

675
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,686
Don't get any bright ideas.

676
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,456
Hey, hold up.

677
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,325
God damnit.

678
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,429
What if they don't come back?

679
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:35,198
Daniel knows what he's doing.

680
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,568
It's alright.

681
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,904
I shouldn't even
be here right now.

682
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:44,174
I should be at Lakeland
turning over patients.

683
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:45,809
Fuck this place.

684
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,478
Well, you're stuck with us
now, Kim, so deal with it.

685
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,814
[soft sobs]

686
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,883
How you doing, honey?

687
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:54,718
It hurts.

688
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:59,422
What's gonna happen to my baby?

689
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,629
Listen to me.

690
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:08,832
You and your baby are
going to be fine.

691
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,800
You have my word.

692
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,412
[suspenseful music]

693
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:25,649
[♪♪]

694
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:48,772
Shit.

695
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:56,379
Fuck.

696
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,815
What the fuck are
you doing in there?

697
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:01,651
[suspenseful music]

698
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:04,821
[♪♪]

699
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,487
[screeching sound]

700
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the fuck's
going on in there?
Ah, shit.
K, time's up.
That's our cue to leave.

701
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,535
[eerie music]

702
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:55,572
[♪♪]

703
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,743
Come on, god damnit!

704
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:01,911
Fuck's sake!

705
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:07,050
Fucking hurry up!

706
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:09,486
Look out!

707
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:11,021
[gunshot]

708
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,393
I'm keeping the fucking gun.

709
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,872
This place isn't gonna
keep anything out.

710
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,745
Oh my god.

711
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:36,747
Hey.

712
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,783
Fuck.

713
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:41,084
What happened?

714
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:42,852
Here, here.

715
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,888
Where's Allie?

716
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,923
Well she went to get some
medicine for Maggie.

717
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,425
Where?

718
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:49,359
The med room.

719
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,461
Jesus Christ.

720
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:53,663
She said there wasn't
anything to worry about inside.

721
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,032
Are you guys in the
same fucking building?

722
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:59,769
Would you please wait
here, look after them?

723
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,604
Excuse me, sir, would
you mind following me?

724
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:02,906
Thank you.

725
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:07,377
That kid will be fine.

726
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:09,346
He's been through a lot worse.

727
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:10,814
Those people killed his family.

728
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:13,016
I barely got him
out of there alive.

729
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,685
Yeah, what about
you, man of mystery?

730
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,554
Mind your own business.

731
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:20,123
And by the way, pretty
stupid to go running off

732
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,958
by herself.

733
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,792
Okay, I'm pretty certain
you can beat the shit out

734
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,729
of me, but I consider it
my special privilege to

735
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:27,797
hate my wife right now so
if you could kindly shut

736
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,766
the fuck up.

737
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:52,722
This is Mitchell's gun.

738
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:08,705
Look.

739
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,766
What?

740
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:41,838

742
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,549
Hello, Daniel.

743
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,688
Who is this?

744
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,057
You saw...

745
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,658
something.

746
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,560
I felt it when you woke up.

747
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:41,598
But what was it?

748
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,604
I can show you
more if you'd like.

749
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:53,176
Hi, Richard.

750
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:56,813
I'm sure it's hard
for you to understand.

751
00:41:56,815 --> 00:42:04,020
Beverly found it difficult
as well, but I assure you

752
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,823
my intentions are altruistic.

753
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:17,567
Please tell me what you've done.

754
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:21,971
Richard.

755
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,908
Richard, tell me.

756
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:28,211
Tell me!

757
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,980
You're trying so hard to
follow in your father's

758
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:32,949
footsteps, Daniel.

759
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:39,622
Do you really wanna follow
him where he's gone?

760
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:45,094
I understand how desperate
loss can make you.

761
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,298
The night you brought
Allison to me, the life

762
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,569
inside her desperately
clawing to get out.

763
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:58,207
Losing my daughter changed
me, but I'm doing what I

764
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:00,276
have to to make it right.

765
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:04,013
You'll understand soon enough.

766
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:07,750
Just please, can you please
tell me where Allison is?

767
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,085
Just...

768
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:12,622
You tell me, god damnit.

769
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:14,757
You tell me where she is.

770
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,993
Don't worry, Daniel.

771
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:19,796
I'm gonna help her.

772
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:21,965
I'm gonna help all of you.

775
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:48,658
This is crazy! I don't
know what I'm doing.

776
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,759
You can't just leave us.

777
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:51,428
Kim, Kim, Kim.
We don't have a choice.

778
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:53,096
Allison's the only one who
knows how to look after Maggie.

779
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:54,230
Please, look.

780
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:55,632
Just...

781
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:56,899
these still seem to work inside.

782
00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:58,267
No.

783
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,069
We'll keep in
touch just in case.

784
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:02,071
We're not gonna be gone
long, we're not going far.

785
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,873
- Look.
- It hurts.

786
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,642
It hurts so bad.

787
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:08,311
I don't know what
half this stuff is!

788
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,879
Please, please don't...

789
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:11,058
Listen to me.

790
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:12,236
Listen to me, please.

791
00:44:12,237 --> 00:44:13,414
We're just gonna down
there, I'm gonna bring

792
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:16,753
back Allison, and I need you to
hold out until then, alright?

793
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,955
What if something happens? What
if those people get in here?

794
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:20,857
What are we supposed to do?

795
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:23,092
Those people are not
trying to get in here.

796
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:26,696
Those people are trying to
keep us from getting out.

797
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:29,432
Okay, that's the
best that I can do.

798
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:31,300
I hope you know how to use it.

799
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:35,004
And uh...

800
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,273
that's there just in case.

801
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:40,076
You better know
what you're doing.

802
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:43,079
[suspenseful music]

803
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,698
Okay, let's go.

804
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:48,316
You think were just gonna go
down there and that'll be that?

805
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:53,122
If you have something to say
than say it, you smug fuck.

806
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,392
Do you know what's down there?

807
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:57,960
Nope.

808
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:04,834
But I know someone who might.

809
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:08,971
Hey.

810
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:10,740
Hey, meth boy.

811
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:11,774
Oh shit.

812
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:13,910
Oh, good, you remember us.

813
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:14,711
It's not my fault, okay?

814
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:15,445
You gotta believe me.

815
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:16,947
I didn't fucking do anything.

816
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:18,448
- Just save it. Save it!
- Please help me!

817
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,410
- These guys are gonna kill me!
- Hey!

818
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:23,119
You're gonna wanna pay
attention to my questions.

819
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:24,987
Please.
No, wait, wait, wait!

820
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:26,155
Oh god, please don't!

821
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:28,157
- Alright, pick a finger.
- Don't do this.

822
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,326
No, no, you didn't
ask me anything yet!

823
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,462
I wanna make sure
you know I'm serious.

824
00:45:32,464 --> 00:45:34,030
I believe you, okay?

825
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,597
- I fucking believe you.
- Okay, okay, hey!

826
00:45:35,598 --> 00:45:37,164
Do you know anything that
will help keep us safe?

827
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:39,002
Anything at all.

828
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:40,837
Anything that will
help us survive.

829
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:42,071
It's the fucking doctor.

830
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,306
It's that fucking doctor.

831
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:45,341
Okay, fine, we
know that already.

832
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,176
We don't have time for this.

833
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:47,977
Alright, you know what?

834
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:48,862
Make it clean.

835
00:45:48,863 --> 00:45:49,746
No, no, please.
It is him.

836
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:51,064
It's him and I killed him.

837
00:45:51,065 --> 00:45:52,381
I swear to god I did
you a fucking favor.

838
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:53,449
Yeah, well he's
not dead anymore.

839
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:55,151
How is that possible?

840
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:57,153
What?

841
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:58,221
Oh god.

842
00:45:58,223 --> 00:46:00,389
Oh, no, no!

Oh god!

846
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:07,964
Stop!

847
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,265
Listen to me.

848
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,901
How is he alive?
What is he?

849
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:13,903
I don't fucking know.

850
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:15,071
Okay, take his hand off.

851
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,873
No, no, please, please!

852
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:17,974
I don't know, I'm serious.

853
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:19,041
I met a girl on the road.

854
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:21,060
Fucking please, please, please.

855
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:23,078
I met a girl on the road
and she told me she could

856
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:25,181
help me score crystal so
I followed her to this

857
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:26,232
fucking pill house.

858
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:27,282
Except it wasn't a pill house.

859
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,384
What was it?

860
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:30,520
What was it?

861
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:33,923
It was an old farm house
in the middle of nowhere.

862
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:36,058
All of these fucking junkies.

863
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,577
It was a mess.

864
00:46:37,578 --> 00:46:39,898
It looked like they'd been
killing people for a while.

865
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:41,964
He gave us drugs.

866
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,499
He watched us have sex.

867
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:44,951
And he called the
place a church.

868
00:46:44,952 --> 00:46:46,402
Okay, what you're telling
me that Richard was some

869
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,871
kind of sex fiend,
religious thing?

870
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:50,206
My dad knew him for
years, we all did.

871
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:51,374
That's bullshit.

872
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:52,975
They were dressed
just like this.

873
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:56,145
There's a bunch of people
dressed like this, okay?

874
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,848
And they did killings
and sacrifices

875
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,017
and they made us watch.

876
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,452
You're talking devil worshiping?

877
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:04,954
No.

878
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:07,323
No, I don't believe
in the devil.

879
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,891
Okay, but I believe in this.

880
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:10,560
They made people change.

881
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:12,195
I saw it.

882
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:13,496
Thank you.

883
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:14,897
You're coming with us.

884
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:16,232
There's no reason to thank us.

885
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:17,266
What?

886
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:18,785
Yeah.

887
00:47:18,786 --> 00:47:20,303

your friend in the basement.

No!

00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,538
- Mhm.
- Are you nuts?

890
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,207
No, you've seen he can do.

891
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:25,374
Let's just get
out of here, okay?

892
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:26,242
Fuck this place.

893
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:27,343
Yeah? Have a look.

894
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:29,178
Go on.

895
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,546
Be my guest.

896
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:32,415
No, this is suicide.

897
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:34,501
Oh my god.

898
00:47:34,502 --> 00:47:36,586
No, you're as crazy as they are.

899
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:38,287
Yeah, maybe.

901
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:51,300
Down here.

Looks like this place
is gonna collapse.

903
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,912
Can you hear me okay?

904
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:06,182
Loud and clear.

905
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:09,252
The stairwell to the basement
is at the back of the building.

906
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,122
Roger that.

907
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:15,324
Got it.

Where are we going?

916
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,310
The door to the morgue
should be right there in

917

I don't see any door.
Just a bunch of corridors.

You sure this is
the right place?

921
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,293
He went down the wrong stairs.

There's only one set of stairs.

923
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:28,164
I know where they're going.

924
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,132
Hello?

925
00:49:30,702 --> 00:49:32,335
Carter!

926
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,206
Better not be leading
us into a trap.

What's going on?

930
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:51,988
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

931
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,423
Did you find it?

932
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:57,393
Is there some kind of
sub-basement or...

933
00:49:57,395 --> 00:50:00,262
No, no, no, what are
you talking about?

934
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:02,732
- A staircase going down.
- What?

936
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:16,312
Carter, can you hear me?

[eerie winds]

938
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:31,460
We gotta go back.

939
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:35,031
I can't ask you to
follow me down here.

940
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:36,699
You understand?

941
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:40,469
Guys, what's happening?

942
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:46,609
Nothing. We're...

943
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:49,078
We're gonna go down the stairs.

944
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:55,518
Hey, leading in with him.

945
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,387
Hey, you get to go first.

946
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,722
Yeah, right.

947
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,323
I'm not asking.

948
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:03,526
Be quiet.

Don't bother.

You won't be able to move.

954
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,197
What? Richard?

955
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,165
Be patient.

956
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:44,667
I'm almost ready.

957
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:46,769
What-what-what is this?

958
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:49,738
I saw you die.

959
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,511
I had no idea that it
would feel like this.

960
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:58,781
The years I spent
operating on people.

961
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,350
Opening them up and
stitching them back

962
00:52:01,352 --> 00:52:03,819
together again.

963
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:07,756
It's remarkable, the
sensation it's...

964
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:11,293
not pain, more a
sense of release.

965
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,662
Why, why are you...

966
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:16,132
Be quiet, please.

967
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:17,934
This is uncharted territory.

968
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:23,506
The chance to study
my own transformation.

969
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:27,510
I understand your
hesitation, Allison, but

970
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:31,380
let me ask you, all these
years, haven't you ever

971
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:35,317
wished to save someone
beyond saving?

972
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,653
No matter what the costs?

973
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:42,258
Well, losing Sarah destroyed me.

974
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,464
But it also compelled
me to find a solution.

975
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:54,570
You'd be surprised at the
things you find when you

976
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:56,605
go looking.

00:53:21,933 --> 00:53:24,500
I've seen this place before.

983
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:27,369
This was all over the
house we cleaned out.

984
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,804
He made us look at things.

985
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:31,941
The worst things I've ever seen.

986
00:53:31,943 --> 00:53:36,412
We found rooms full of bodies in
the basement of that place.

987
00:53:36,414 --> 00:53:38,981
They had someone on a
table like they were doing

988
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:40,883
surgery down there.

989
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,518
Half turned into
one of those things.

00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,586
No!

991
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:46,822
No, worse than that.

Hey!

1003
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,886
Yeah.

1004
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:21,657
He has took me here to... baby.

1005
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:22,591
I'm right here, kiddo.

It's okay, it's alright.

You're gonna be fine.

1008
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:29,531
You're lucky your grandpa
cares about you so much.

1009
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:32,701

at his TV and smokes.

Help her, please.

- The paradigm, I think.
- Alright.

00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,879
Okay, Maggie, hold
still for one second.

1016
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:45,614
I got this. Okay.

I'm gonna give you
something that's really

you go when you die?

I do.

1047
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:53,776
You travel on, reborn into
something else, like a

caterpillar becoming a moth.

1049
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:59,615
Until now I've only been able to
track the moth in its cocoon.

1050
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:01,984
The body has to
adjust, of course.

1051
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:04,186
It adapts.

1052
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:06,922
We weren't built for
this kind of thing.

1053
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:13,061
I admit, early on
I made mistakes.

are still down here with us.

I am going to help you.

1061
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:42,024
This is an end to the
cycle of life and death.

Do you really want this world?

your son from you?

that night to your unborn child?

No, please.

Umbilical cord became entangled.

Simple as that.
Strange, isn't it?

you and your child,

around his neck as he

Tighter and tighter until
finally it couldn't

The true resurrection.
