00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:06,117
ENGLAND, TODAY.

3
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:18,619
What the hell is this?

4
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:20,716
I don't know.

5
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:29,560
Bloody hell.

6
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:34,022
<i>The Crossrail is the biggest
construction project in Europe.</i>

7
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:36,933
<i>Carving 26 miles of new
commuter train tunnels</i>

8
00:02:36,963 --> 00:02:38,699
<i>beneath the surface of London.</i>

9
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:43,113
<i>But today, an ancient tomb filled with
the coffins of crusader knights...</i>

10
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,228
<i>People don't realize
that London is a giant graveyard.</i>

11
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:49,214
<i>A modern city built
on centuries of death.</i>

12
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:50,933
<i>Because of the tombs
proximity to the Thames...</i>

13
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:52,897
<i>...half the space is flooded,
is that right doctor?</i>

14
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:55,377
<i>There are even more coffins
submerged under water.</i>

15
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,167
<i>The tomb appears to have been built
during the second Crusade...</i>

16
00:02:58,168 --> 00:03:01,814
<i>...which means it's filled with the bodies
of crusader knights who invaded Egypt...</i>

17
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:03,252
<i>...before returning to England.</i>

18
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:07,067
<i>It has also revealed a treasure trove
of secrets about London's history.</i>

19
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,712
Clear them out, please.

20
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:24,891
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stop what you are doing.

21
00:03:25,257 --> 00:03:28,031
The train tunnel has been
rerouted north of here.

22
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,174
We are now taking control of this site.

23
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,482
Please collect your tools and
gear and exit immediately.

24
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:39,101
Ohy!

25
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:41,052
Excuse me. Excuse me.

26
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:43,366
This is my site.
What do you think you are doing?

27
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:47,047
Evacuate your men.
We'll take it from here.

28
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:50,810
Who the hell are you people?

29
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:53,557
This way, sir.
Thank you very much.

30
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,585
<i>The past cannot remain buried forever.</i>

31
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
<i>In my lifetime, I have unearth...</i>

32
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,484
<i>...many ancient mysteries.</i>

33
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,356
<i>At last, this tomb...</i>

34
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,854
<i>...reveals antiquities darkest secret.</i>

35
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,398
<i>A secret erased from history...</i>

36
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:23,929
<i>...and forgotten to time.</i>

37
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:27,627
<i>Princess Ahmanet.</i>

38
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:31,245
<i>Beautiful...</i>

39
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:33,147
<i>...cunning...</i>

40
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:36,458
<i>...and ruthless.</i>

41
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,729
<i>Sole heir to the throne of Egypt.</i>

42
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:45,219
<i>The Pharaohs kingdom will one day
be hers to rule...</i>

43
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,595
<i>...without mercy or fear.</i>

44
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:52,515
<i>And Ahmanet would be
worshipped as a living God.</i>

45
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:14,376
<i>But Pharaoh had a son.</i>

46
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,824
<i>The boy now, would inherit
her destiny.</i>

47
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:23,028
<i>And Ahmanet understood
power was not given...</i>

48
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:25,793
<i>...it had to be taken.</i>

49
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:32,687
<i>Vowing revenge...</i>

50
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,801
<i>...she made a choice to embrace evil.</i>

51
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:37,756
<i>Seth.</i>

52
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,919
<i>The God of death.</i>

53
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:43,549
<i>They made a pact.</i>

54
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:49,607
<i>A pact that would unleash
darkness itself.</i>

55
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:39,718
<i>Ahmanet was reborn...</i>

56
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:42,907
<i>...a monster.</i>

57
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:53,106
<i>Yet the pact was not complete.</i>

58
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:57,242
<i>She vowed to bring the demon
into our world...</i>

59
00:06:57,506 --> 00:06:59,171
<i>...in the body of a mortal man.</i>

60
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:04,295
<i>Together, they would take their
vengeance upon humanity.</i>

61
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,256
<i>For her sins,
Ahmanet was mummified alive.</i>

62
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,506
<i>Her body carried far from Egypt.</i>

63
00:07:44,394 --> 00:07:49,247
<i>There she would remain,
condemned to eternal darkness.</i>

64
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:54,304
<i>But death is a doorway...</i>

65
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:58,977
<i>...and the past cannot
remain buried forever.</i>

66
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,876
Out of luck, ah Sarge?

67
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,492
The civilians are gone.

68
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:40,972
Is filled with insurgents down there.

69
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:43,497
I guess we're too late.

70
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,066
We can do this.

71
00:08:54,865 --> 00:08:56,865
Oh no no no! We're too late!

72
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,805
Command thinks we are
doing advanced recon...

73
00:08:59,043 --> 00:09:00,969
...a 100 miles from here.

74
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:02,745
Sarge, you are not going down there.

75
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,885
You're right.
I'm not. We are.

76
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,940
- At least call in an air strike.
- Air Strike?

77
00:09:09,344 --> 00:09:10,344
Bad idea.

78
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:11,655
A little one.
Just maybe they'll run off.

79
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:13,255
You think command will
know where we are.

80
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:15,621
And then we will do 20 years
in Leavenworth for looting.

81
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:18,531
Hey, what did I tell you?
Hey, We are not looters.

82
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:21,644
We are liberators of
precious antiquities.

83
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:22,745
- Right.
- Right.

84
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:24,088
But we don't even know
what's down there.

85
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:28,244
Haram. Haram is what's down there.
Treasure.

86
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:31,378
No, the translator said "Haram" means
"forbidden knowledge".

87
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:32,669
Like a curse.

88
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:34,795
Around here that's just another
word for "treasure."

89
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:36,955
And this guy, this..
Henry guy...

90
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:38,613
...it seems to want it pretty bad.

91
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:41,177
Well.. now he is gonna
have to pay double.

92
00:09:41,441 --> 00:09:43,248
- Mount up.
- "No, sir, I ain't going on this one."

93
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,444
- What?
- I'm not going.

94
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:45,621
Vail.

95
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:48,043
What are you going to do?
"Stab me with that?"

96
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:51,241
Oh no no no no.. No!

97
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,620
You crazy bastard.

98
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:55,263
It's a full days ride
to the nearest water!

99
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,886
The nearest water is right
down in that village.

100
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,597
Come on, Vail.

101
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,278
Where is your sense of adventure?

102
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:04,929
Oh that's just great, Nick!
That's just great!

103
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:08,670
Come on, we slip in - slip
out, just like we always do.

104
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:11,022
You son of a bitch!

105
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,208
Oh my God!

106
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:13,882
We are gonna die..
we are gonna die!

107
00:10:15,772 --> 00:10:16,991
Move! Move.

108
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:18,609
Just run.. run run.

109
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:22,980
Let's go! Go.. go!

110
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:24,986
Are you kidding me?

111
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:28,641
"Slip in - slip out"?

112
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,344
This is not what we always do!

113
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:34,140
Stairs! Just run! Run!

114
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:37,673
Run! Run! Run!

115
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,341
Grenade!

116
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,638
I hate you, I hate you so much!

117
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,512
I never even wanted to come..
To this country!

118
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:53,582
Let me think.
Just let me think.

119
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:56,124
If anyone is listening...

120
00:10:56,298 --> 00:10:58,639
...this is L-26, RMJ Hot!

121
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,525
Request dynamic precision strike
at our mark!

122
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:04,223
You did not.. just
called in an air strike!

123
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,554
Oh.. yes.. I.. did!

124
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:11,458
Where are you going? Don't leave me!

125
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:15,040
Where do they keep coming from?

126
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,293
There is nowhere to go!

127
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:27,106
Oh man we are gonna die!

128
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:29,137
Please, Vail! Let me think!

129
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,626
We are gonna die because of you!

130
00:11:30,627 --> 00:11:31,627
Just let me think!

131
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,712
Think about what? Think about what?

132
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:35,357
I'm thinking...

133
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:38,282
What?

134
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,939
I'm thinking...

135
00:11:40,912 --> 00:11:42,288
What are you thinking?

136
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:46,987
I'm thinking.. we are
probably gonna die here.

137
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:48,761
I knew it!

138
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:49,936
I knew it!

139
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:26,389
I am still alive!

140
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:43,768
Nick!

141
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:01,258
Haram.

142
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:12,573
I was told you boys were supposed
to be a 100 clicks from here!

143
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:15,221
Yes, sir!
But based on intelligence...

144
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:19,433
...we had reason to believe the insurgents
were holding civilian hostages.

145
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:20,798
We had to make the call.

146
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:22,976
Wait for Delta team to
respond or go in alone.

147
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:25,457
It was Sergeant Morton's
idea to go in actually!

148
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:28,443
Only to find out that the villagers
had long since evacuated.

149
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:29,893
Yeah lucky for them, not for us.

150
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:31,672
Delta, south side perimeter.

151
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:35,749
Sir, when we realized that we were at the
center of the insurgents stronghold...

152
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,832
...it was too late.

153
00:13:36,969 --> 00:13:39,656
We were discovered, we started
taking on heavy fire.

154
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:43,193
Well.. Sir, Corporal Vail here
is too humble to admit it...

155
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:46,186
But he risked his life to save mine.

156
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:50,151
He is a hero, in fact.. I'd like to
recommend him for a citation.

157
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:52,771
Let me run another scenario of mine.

158
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:53,776
Sir?

159
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:57,731
One in which two assholes
from long range reconnaissance...

160
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,103
...that would be you...

161
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:02,652
...run all over northern Iraq,
just one step ahead of the enemy.

162
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,929
Except, instead of
hunting for the enemy...

163
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,050
...you hunt for antiquities...

164
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:11,390
...stealing whatever isn't nailed down
and selling it on the black market.

165
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,906
Meanwhile, these
fanatical insurgents...

166
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,289
...trying to erase
5,000 years of history...

167
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:19,593
...unwillingly cover your tracks.
It's a pretty good scam.

168
00:14:19,848 --> 00:14:20,848
Sergeant Morton!

169
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:23,331
Where is it?

170
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:25,503
What? Where is what?

171
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:28,593
The letter.
The map you stole from me.

172
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:31,074
Map? I do not know what
you are talking about.

173
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:32,026
How would I...

174
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:35,042
had even had the opportunity to
steal anything from you, Miss...?

175
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:36,974
Miss...

176
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:41,828
Ok.. Sgt. Morton here thinks
that I would be too embarrassed..

177
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:44,618
...to tell you that I had him
in my hotel room...

178
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,203
...3 nights ago, in Baghdad.

179
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:49,308
And whilst I was sleeping,
he went through my things.

180
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:51,666
I'm not embarrassed, Nick.

181
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:55,015
Disgusted? Yes.
Regretful? Ah certainly.

182
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,212
But mainly just amazed,
to your ability...

183
00:14:57,403 --> 00:15:00,328
...to mimic all the qualities
of genuine human intimacy...

184
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:03,067
...if only for.. 15 seconds?

185
00:15:03,314 --> 00:15:04,927
Where is the map, Morton?

186
00:15:06,762 --> 00:15:08,138
Sir, I admit that...

187
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:11,929
...Miss Halsey and I did spend
a delightful evening in Baghdad.

188
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:14,367
A very long and satisfying evening...

189
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,075
...if her reactions are to be
considered sincere.

190
00:15:17,311 --> 00:15:19,462
But Sir, I left with
nothing more than fond memories.

191
00:15:19,463 --> 00:15:22,808
Now, perhaps I may have neglected to
say goodbye to her the next morning...

192
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:24,586
...only because she was exhausted...

193
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:26,466
- .. and I did not want to wake her.
- Ok.

194
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:28,571
And the reward for my
gracious consideration?

195
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,856
Well Sir, as you can see
"Hell hath no fury".

196
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:33,411
- Sir.
- Oh my God!

197
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:40,324
It's Egyptian.

198
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:42,164
Why is that unusual?

199
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:43,731
We are in the Persian Gulf, Vail.

200
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:46,870
Right. Egypt is a 1000
miles away so it's unusual.

201
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,000
Put those down, hurry.
Go get the rest.

202
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:50,001
Got it.

203
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:54,299
Colonel, this is an significant find.
I need your men to secure this village.

204
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,123
We are not even supposed to be here.

205
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:59,549
Is my job to make sure that anything of
value stays out of enemy hands.

206
00:15:59,844 --> 00:16:01,641
We have no idea what
could be down there.

207
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,135
The content of Tutankhamun's
tomb alone...

208
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:07,423
...were valued at
650 million pounds sterling.

209
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:08,648
Understand?

210
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,488
Colonel..
if I may With a couple shake charges...

211
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:18,829
...we could just close this hole right up,
and Miss Halsey can come back another day.

212
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,563
- Shut up.
- Okay.

213
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:21,877
You got two hours,
then we're moving out.

214
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:23,042
You are getting in the hole with him.

215
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:24,043
- Him?
- Me?

216
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:24,924
Yep.

217
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:26,279
Sir.

218
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:27,642
You gear up, that's an order.

219
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:29,255
I'll be right here on the road Sarge.

220
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:30,603
Get in the damn hole, Vail!

221
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:31,921
Oh man!

222
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,308
I am in a large
antechamber of some kind.

223
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:20,700
There is an inscription
on the northern wall.

224
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,320
The litany of Ra.

225
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,262
..kidding me?

226
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,244
Your fault, Nick.
Your fault.

227
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Do you see any treasure here, Nick?
Because I don't.
Do you know what I see?
I see statues that I can't carry out.

228
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:36,959
- Keep it down.
- You keep it down.

229
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:38,446
What are you doing?

230
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:43,177
It is definitely a tomb.

231
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,250
What is that? Mercury?

232
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:57,958
Yeah.

233
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:05,518
The Ancient Egyptians believed
that it weakened the evil spirits.

234
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:09,491
Well now we know better.
This stuff will kill you.

235
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:11,141
Yeah, after it makes you crazy.

236
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:15,281
There is mercury dripping
from the ceiling...

237
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:17,306
...into holes in the ground.

238
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:19,204
Possibly to connect the..

239
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:22,415
It's a canal system...

240
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,265
...leading all the way to...

241
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:29,069
Get the lights!

242
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,371
Oh my God.

243
00:19:16,835 --> 00:19:18,093
Get everything out of the bags.

244
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:22,259
What did I tell you?

245
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:23,953
That's a lot of gold, Nick.

246
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:28,293
I am in a large men-made cavern
adjoining the antechamber.

247
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:30,713
There are chiseled steps
descending from the ledge.

248
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:32,967
There is a canal at the
center of them...

249
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:38,202
...that feeds a ritual well at
the base, filled with mercury.

250
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:44,523
Beads of scarabs,
scarab signal rings.

251
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:48,656
This is a high priest of Ammon...

252
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,359
...from the temple of the Thebes.

253
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:54,372
There is a ritual barrier chain
that's around the well...

254
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:56,737
...as a warning to intruders.

255
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:58,032
To keep people out.

256
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:07,134
There isn't a single provision made for
someone's journey into the underworld.

257
00:20:08,195 --> 00:20:11,447
No Canopic jars, no Shabtis.

258
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:15,236
To be buried in a place like this...

259
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:18,945
...would have been a
fate worse than death.

260
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:21,495
Nick!

261
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:24,367
Don't even think about it.

262
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,667
There are six watchers
around the well...

263
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,795
...facing inward instead of out.

264
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,111
Whatever is in there...

265
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,452
...those chains aren't
for bringing it up.

266
00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:44,510
They are for holding it down.

267
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,760
This is not a tomb.

268
00:20:59,671 --> 00:21:00,885
It's a prison.

269
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:02,336
<i>Lima 2-6, come in.</i>

270
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:04,333
Copy, sir.

271
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:06,670
<i>Get out now.
We've got reports of boogeys inbound.</i>

272
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:08,441
<i>We gotta take off.</i>

273
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:10,714
Tell Greenway we have
to notify D.T.R.A.

274
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:11,601
For what?

275
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:13,553
- I need specialists from Cairo...
- Cairo?

276
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:14,775
...seaborn suits and shielding cuffs.

277
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:18,507
Jenny, we are out of time.
You better grab what you can now!

278
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:20,732
I'm not leaving until I see
what's in that pool.

279
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,595
Oh you are leaving.
We're leaving right now.

280
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:25,008
I have not come this far
just to leave without...

281
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:25,979
Hey! Hey!

282
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,591
Cease fire! Vail!

283
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:33,039
Cease fire! Cease fire!

284
00:22:33,338 --> 00:22:36,584
They are just camel spiders!
They're not even poisonous!

285
00:22:36,804 --> 00:22:38,398
Can we please, leave?

286
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:40,388
- Are you out of your mind, Vail?
- Please!

287
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:41,624
What is wrong with you?

288
00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:42,747
That thing bit my neck!

289
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:44,624
- Okay.. okay.
- It bit me!

290
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:46,481
Enough of this!
I don't care!

291
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:48,622
I'm leaving! With or without you!
I'm leaving!

292
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:50,817
It bit me! Please, Nick!

293
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,513
Can we please, leave?

294
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,682
YOU HAVE SET ME FREE.

295
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:56,244
MY CHOSEN.

296
00:23:57,611 --> 00:23:58,907
<i>Nick!</i>

297
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,340
<i>Nick!</i>

298
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,104
Nick!

299
00:24:02,282 --> 00:24:05,043
Tell Greenway he is gonna send a team
to get this thing out of here...

300
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:07,808
...or he is gonna have to
explain why he left me behind.

301
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:14,946
Do it!

302
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:16,689
Okay.

303
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:33,179
Climb by the man!

304
00:24:33,487 --> 00:24:34,487
<i>Climb line is steady.</i>

305
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:35,936
More towards your nine o'clock!

306
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,175
<i>Holding at 30 feet.</i>

307
00:24:37,286 --> 00:24:38,630
A little more.

308
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,578
<i>Bishop to Echo. We have
visual on a severe sandstorm...</i>

309
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,994
<i>...heading west to Echo 12.</i>

310
00:26:02,701 --> 00:26:03,701
Hey!

311
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:04,931
Hey!

312
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,850
Wait.. wait.. please be careful.
This is 5,000 years old.

313
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,615
60 seconds!
In the air! Let's go!

314
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,784
Careful, careful.

315
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:21,162
Get us off the ground now!

316
00:26:21,276 --> 00:26:22,884
Halsey, take a sit!

317
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:16,368
Need some help?

318
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:17,439
No.

319
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:20,428
- You are welcome by the way.
- How's that?

320
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,173
Because I saved your..
whatever it is.

321
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:27,728
That was safely hidden for 5,000 years
before you dropped a hellfire missile on it.

322
00:27:27,971 --> 00:27:29,890
And you might have never
found it otherwise.

323
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:32,297
Again.. you're welcome.

324
00:27:36,052 --> 00:27:38,308
Do you have any idea what this is?

325
00:27:38,612 --> 00:27:40,160
The significance of it?

326
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,991
An Egyptian sarcophagus
in a tomb in Mesopotamia.

327
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:48,506
Why just say "15 seconds"?

328
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:49,806
What of what?

329
00:27:50,257 --> 00:27:53,803
You told Greenway that I can mimic
all the qualities of human intimacy...

330
00:27:54,096 --> 00:27:55,572
...for 15 seconds.

331
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:58,770
I mean.. uh..
it was not 15 seconds.

332
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:03,069
Well, however long it lasted,
it wasn't real.

333
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:07,541
I never lied to you about my feelings.

334
00:28:07,814 --> 00:28:09,552
You stole from me.

335
00:28:10,361 --> 00:28:11,728
But I didn't lie.

336
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:14,758
Do you ever think of anyone
but yourself?

337
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:18,431
This means something.

338
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,570
Something bigger than you can imagine.

339
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:26,944
My life's work.

340
00:28:27,215 --> 00:28:29,085
And you were going to steal it.

341
00:28:30,469 --> 00:28:32,819
How much do you think that's
worth on the black market?

342
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:57,767
This is Dr. Jennifer Halsey..

343
00:28:58,053 --> 00:29:01,806
Conducting a preliminary analysis
of an Egyptian sarcophagus...

344
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:05,549
...discovered in the Nineveh
province, northern Iraq.

345
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:09,068
The hieroglyphs are
definitely New Kingdom.

346
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,711
It appears that the wife
of King Menehptre...

347
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,437
...died in childbirth...

348
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:19,576
...leaving a sole heir to the throne...

349
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:22,277
...a girl...

350
00:29:25,286 --> 00:29:28,632
...called Ahmanet.

351
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:05,301
Corporal, what in the living
hell are you doing son?

352
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
Vail?

353
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,315
Corporal Vail?

354
00:30:10,764 --> 00:30:11,576
Dammit.

355
00:30:11,735 --> 00:30:14,375
Corporal Vail, do you hear me talking
to you? I said what are you..

356
00:30:17,445 --> 00:30:18,445
Vail, just...

357
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:19,927
Vail! Wow.. wow!

358
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:21,469
Vail!

359
00:30:21,591 --> 00:30:22,591
Oh my God. Vail!

360
00:30:22,728 --> 00:30:23,888
Drop the weapon! Drop it now!

361
00:30:23,963 --> 00:30:24,683
Now!

362
00:30:24,863 --> 00:30:25,863
Please.. please..

363
00:30:25,983 --> 00:30:26,736
Drop it now!

364
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:28,199
- Put the gun down!
- Drop it!

365
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:31,341
Put down the weapon! Put it down..
Back off..

366
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:33,788
Stop! Do not shoot!
This is a pressurized aircraft!

367
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:34,965
Nick.

368
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,467
Vail.

369
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:41,142
- Vail, put the knife down.
- Vail.

370
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:42,429
- Vail, no.
- Vail!

371
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:43,701
Vail!

372
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:52,161
Ehy Vail! Stop! Stop!
Vail.. Vail!

373
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:10,449
I'm sorry.

374
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

375
00:31:19,932 --> 00:31:21,231
Pan-pan-pan.

376
00:31:21,408 --> 00:31:23,086
This is November 4-0-9-9.

377
00:31:23,286 --> 00:31:25,435
United States C-130 Hercules.

378
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:27,536
- What's happening?
- Take your sit and strap in.

379
00:31:27,608 --> 00:31:28,669
- ...over England.
- England?

380
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,830
Right now I don't know what's
happening. Take your sit!

381
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,489
We lost thrust in both engines.

382
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:37,408
No way to our contact.
Dropping to 12,000, 280 on the EDI.

383
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:39,109
What the hell is that?

384
00:31:41,737 --> 00:31:42,737
Go! Go! Go!

385
00:31:55,764 --> 00:31:56,898
Parachute!

386
00:31:58,511 --> 00:31:59,585
Parachute!

387
00:32:08,808 --> 00:32:09,863
I do not know how to do this!

388
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:11,983
Jenny, you can do this!
You can do this!

389
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,102
Give me your hand!

390
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

391
00:34:20,848 --> 00:34:21,860
Vail!

392
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:23,715
Hey buddy.

393
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:27,495
You scared the shit out of me.

394
00:34:29,346 --> 00:34:31,893
We need to talk, Nick.

395
00:34:35,613 --> 00:34:36,639
What's happening?

396
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,189
You know what's happening.

397
00:34:42,476 --> 00:34:44,399
Am I dead?

398
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,726
Dead?

399
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No. But you are gonna wish you were.
Come on this way, please.
Oh my God! Nick.
Jen.

400
00:34:58,757 --> 00:35:00,211
What's happening? Where am I?

401
00:35:00,702 --> 00:35:01,874
Who's in charge here?

402
00:35:05,706 --> 00:35:07,234
<i>Base, this is search team one.</i>

403
00:35:07,376 --> 00:35:08,750
<i>Looks like the trail of wreckage...</i>

404
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:11,778
<i>...it's spread across 2-2,5
half miles through the forest.</i>

405
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:14,284
<i>Coming up on the Aylestord pier now.
Standby.</i>

406
00:35:18,848 --> 00:35:22,353
The pier is a wreck.
It looks like a part of the wing. A turbine.

407
00:35:22,482 --> 00:35:24,971
Miles away from the
primary crash site. Over.

408
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:27,646
<i>Copy, search team one.
Message received.</i>

409
00:35:39,315 --> 00:35:42,317
One body found.
No obvious signs of life. Standby.

410
00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:50,801
Casualty confirmed deceased.

411
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:53,401
Requesting attendance of
ambulance personnel. Over.

412
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,380
<i>Copy, search team one.</i>

413
00:35:55,509 --> 00:35:57,761
<i>Ambulance staff now on route.
Over.</i>

414
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

415
00:37:02,773 --> 00:37:05,300
What.. what the hell...?

416
00:37:09,068 --> 00:37:11,120
Hey! You better come in to...

417
00:37:12,218 --> 00:37:13,435
Allen?

418
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:15,546
Allen?

419
00:37:16,213 --> 00:37:17,213
You alright?

420
00:37:19,521 --> 00:37:20,521
Allen!

421
00:37:23,606 --> 00:37:24,677
Jesus!

422
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

423
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

424
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:20,566
Rise.

425
00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:02,128
<i>A US military plane crash landed
in Surrey this evening...</i>

426
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:04,228
<i>...just missing Waverley Abbey.</i>

427
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:07,000
How did you get out of that plane?

428
00:39:08,697 --> 00:39:11,595
There's not a single
scratch on your body.

429
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:12,613
Yeah.

430
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:17,432
Thank you.

431
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,975
For what?

432
00:39:22,508 --> 00:39:23,856
You saved my life.

433
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:26,614
You would have done the same for me.

434
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:28,916
Nick.

435
00:39:29,474 --> 00:39:30,474
Nick.

436
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:33,698
Listen, Nick.

437
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:36,565
I think you should know something.

438
00:39:36,831 --> 00:39:39,432
You know I work with a
group of archaeologists.

439
00:39:39,687 --> 00:39:40,718
- Yeah.
- Well...

440
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:42,406
...we developed this theory...

441
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:46,026
...that an Egyptian princess had been
erased from the history books...

442
00:39:48,004 --> 00:39:49,004
...deliberately.

443
00:39:50,252 --> 00:39:53,748
We've been searching for something called
"The dagger of Seth".

444
00:39:54,447 --> 00:39:58,304
<i>A ceremonial knife with
a large jewel at the hilt.</i>

445
00:39:58,305 --> 00:40:01,030
<i>Seth is the Egyptian God of death.</i>

446
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:05,135
And legend has it that
the dagger and the stone, together...

447
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,932
...had the power to give
Seth physical form.

448
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:11,768
I'm convinced it was
hidden here, in Europe.

449
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:14,701
Stolen by crusaders centuries ago.

450
00:40:14,702 --> 00:40:19,019
I found reference to it in a manuscript
written by a crusader knight...

451
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,918
that suggested the
dagger was broken apart.

452
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:26,014
<i>That the stone buried
with this knight...</i>

453
00:40:26,015 --> 00:40:27,971
<i>...somewhere here in England.</i>

454
00:40:29,536 --> 00:40:33,477
<i>A massive crusader tomb, was recently
discovered under London.</i>

455
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:38,328
<i>We believe that the stone
is in there somewhere.</i>

456
00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:42,995
<i>That tomb is what led us to Ahmanet.</i>

457
00:40:43,996 --> 00:40:46,432
I think she is the
princess in the legend.

458
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,014
The hieroglyphics said that
she murdered her father.

459
00:40:49,015 --> 00:40:51,612
- Murdered?
- Along with his child.

460
00:40:51,912 --> 00:40:55,055
She made some sort of pact
with the God of death.

461
00:40:55,363 --> 00:40:57,664
And then, when I saw those birds...

462
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:01,131
...and that sandstorm...
Whatever I mean something is happening.

463
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:03,392
You are alive I do not know how.

464
00:41:03,745 --> 00:41:05,343
You... I... Go...

465
00:41:05,526 --> 00:41:08,570
I'm sorry, Nick.
I think we angered the Gods.

466
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:13,011
Can you excuse me?

467
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:14,813
I'll be right back.

468
00:41:20,074 --> 00:41:26,074
_

469
00:41:29,104 --> 00:41:29,885
Jennifer.

470
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:33,462
This is a far more significant problem
than we have ever imagined.

471
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,101
<i>Something is happening, Henry.
I'm worried about him.</i>

472
00:41:36,258 --> 00:41:39,531
Bring your soldier to London.
Do not discuss anything further with him.

473
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:40,801
<i>Understand?</i>

474
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,379
What are you doing here?

475
00:41:43,673 --> 00:41:44,673
Jenny looks good.

476
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:46,781
- Ok this isn't happening.
- I mean really great.

477
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:47,908
Ok. Really stop.

478
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,718
You know I always thought
I had a chance with her.

479
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,700
- What?
- How do you squander that?

480
00:41:51,938 --> 00:41:53,498
There was mercury in that tomb.
Vapors.

481
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:54,769
How did you mess that up?

482
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:56,009
It's just in my head.

483
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,705
No it's not.

484
00:41:58,268 --> 00:41:59,381
You shot me.

485
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:03,390
Wait. What.. wait wait wait you...

486
00:42:05,286 --> 00:42:06,286
You...

487
00:42:07,503 --> 00:42:08,905
...you stabbed Greenway.

488
00:42:09,342 --> 00:42:10,662
- I saved you.
- You murdered him.

489
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:11,792
And you shot me.

490
00:42:12,267 --> 00:42:14,815
You tried to kill me.
You even went after Jenny.

491
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:17,451
You shot me. Three times.

492
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:19,970
Yes.

493
00:42:19,978 --> 00:42:20,978
Three times, Nick.

494
00:42:21,948 --> 00:42:23,609
The third one was unnecessary.

495
00:42:24,297 --> 00:42:26,274
You freaked me out.
I panicked.

496
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:28,567
I'm sorry. Okay?

497
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:29,797
Not okay.

498
00:42:29,857 --> 00:42:31,873
Look at me. Look at my face.

499
00:42:32,097 --> 00:42:33,804
I'm cursed Nick, and you are cursed.

500
00:42:34,504 --> 00:42:36,024
And there is only one way to break it.

501
00:42:36,144 --> 00:42:38,829
You're going to do
exactly what she wants...

502
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:41,898
...or this is gonna get a lot
worse for both of us.

503
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:43,894
What do you mean I'm cursed?

504
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,166
Sorry.

505
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:48,177
Just.. uh.. give me a minute.
Thank you.

506
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:50,225
You walked into the chicks
bathroom by the way.

507
00:42:50,436 --> 00:42:51,436
Go to your own bathroom!

508
00:42:51,676 --> 00:42:53,003
Yes, it's the ladies room.

509
00:42:53,177 --> 00:42:54,540
What do you mean I'm cursed?

510
00:42:54,717 --> 00:42:56,361
How do you think you
survived the crash?

511
00:42:58,879 --> 00:43:00,198
"Setapai".

512
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,586
You know what it means.

513
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:07,079
She's got plans for you, Nick.

514
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:08,740
Plans?

515
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,700
You can't run away.

516
00:43:11,206 --> 00:43:13,470
You can't escape.

517
00:44:27,021 --> 00:44:28,021
Help me!

518
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Help me!

519
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,012
Get out of the road, wanker!

520
00:44:47,169 --> 00:44:48,169
Nick!

521
00:44:48,202 --> 00:44:49,470
What the hell are you doing?

522
00:44:50,845 --> 00:44:51,872
I think you were right.

523
00:44:52,947 --> 00:44:55,460
- We angered the Gods.
- Wait.. what?

524
00:44:55,702 --> 00:44:58,040
I saw her..
the chick in the box.

525
00:44:58,338 --> 00:44:59,379
- Ahmanet?
- That one.

526
00:44:59,601 --> 00:45:00,801
- Nick...
- He said I'm cursed.

527
00:45:01,022 --> 00:45:02,022
- Who said?
- Vail.

528
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:03,332
- Vail?
- The coffin we found.

529
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:04,536
- Sarcophagus.
- Whatever.

530
00:45:04,604 --> 00:45:05,604
There was writing on it.

531
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:06,571
Hieroglyphics.

532
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,061
Jenny, respectfully, I'm not interested
in archeological jargon right now.

533
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:13,582
The writing on the box
that we took out of the hole.

534
00:45:13,807 --> 00:45:14,632
Yes, sorry.

535
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:16,946
There was something about a curse
in there, was it there? Was it there?

536
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,762
Nick, you've had a concussion.

537
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:21,762
- Yes.
- Toxic exposure.

538
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:25,149
How does that explain that I know
that "Setapai" means: "My Chosen".

539
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,949
- It's Ancient Egyptian.
- Ancient Egyptian.

540
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:29,770
How do I know that?

541
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:30,898
You've been in the
middle east for years.

542
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:31,611
What? No!

543
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:32,808
You heard it.. you forgot it..

544
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:35,231
Why are you backing off from this?
I'm telling you.

545
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,907
She is real.

546
00:45:46,414 --> 00:45:47,420
Nick.

547
00:45:49,143 --> 00:45:50,690
Nick.. what is it?

548
00:45:52,689 --> 00:45:54,349
I think you're right.

549
00:45:55,817 --> 00:45:56,905
I.. This is all in my head.

550
00:45:57,903 --> 00:45:59,510
Can't you find the box, look inside

551
00:45:59,702 --> 00:46:01,822
...and when I see a 3,000
years old prune in there...

552
00:46:01,938 --> 00:46:03,517
- Nick.
- ...no more curse.

553
00:46:03,696 --> 00:46:05,718
You don't need a sarcophagus,
you need a doctor.

554
00:46:05,904 --> 00:46:07,197
I know someone.

555
00:46:07,769 --> 00:46:08,818
A specialist in London.

556
00:46:09,464 --> 00:46:11,405
Don't tell me that you
don't want to see it too.

557
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,210
Your life's work, come on Jenny.

558
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:17,326
I think I know where it is.

559
00:46:19,415 --> 00:46:21,662
<i>Charlie 8-1 the base.</i>

560
00:46:21,968 --> 00:46:25,126
<i>We are at impact site,
400m north of Waverley Abbey.</i>

561
00:46:25,506 --> 00:46:28,424
<i>Firefighters control the fire...</i>

562
00:47:09,932 --> 00:47:10,946
Nick.

563
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Nick! Where are you going?
The crash isn't up that way.
Where are you going?
No.
We are in the right place.

564
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:26,520
Nick.

565
00:47:28,881 --> 00:47:29,881
Nick!

566
00:47:30,437 --> 00:47:32,017
I do not know what we're doing here.

567
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:34,261
This isn't the right place.

568
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:36,196
Yes it is.

569
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,048
No it isn't.

570
00:47:38,248 --> 00:47:40,896
The main crash site it's up that way...

571
00:47:41,093 --> 00:47:42,293
...and so is my artifact.

572
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,740
And that's where we are going.

573
00:48:19,213 --> 00:48:20,902
What the hell?

574
00:48:22,968 --> 00:48:23,968
How did I..?

575
00:48:33,425 --> 00:48:34,425
Jenny?

576
00:48:53,855 --> 00:48:54,921
Nick?

577
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

578
00:49:35,189 --> 00:49:36,189
Ok.

579
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:37,374
Ok.

580
00:49:44,966 --> 00:49:45,966
What?

581
00:49:46,265 --> 00:49:48,139
GOD OF DEATH...

582
00:49:51,268 --> 00:49:52,476
I'm sorry. What?

583
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:56,823
POWERFUL SETH...

584
00:49:58,194 --> 00:50:02,433
...I WELCOME YOU INTO
THIS MORTAL BODY...

585
00:50:11,747 --> 00:50:13,186
No.

586
00:50:14,317 --> 00:50:16,139
UNITE TO ME FINALLY.

587
00:50:37,378 --> 00:50:38,378
Jenny!

588
00:50:39,797 --> 00:50:40,797
Yeah?

589
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:42,931
Run!

590
00:51:25,272 --> 00:51:26,272
Come on! Come on!

591
00:51:30,978 --> 00:51:32,965
Nick!

592
00:51:33,813 --> 00:51:34,831
Nick!

593
00:51:35,395 --> 00:51:36,714
Hey! Hey!

594
00:51:39,045 --> 00:51:40,982
No! No! No!

595
00:51:41,215 --> 00:51:43,302
Ehy! Nick! No!

596
00:51:43,593 --> 00:51:44,593
Nick!

597
00:51:46,129 --> 00:51:47,391
Were you just gonna leave me?

598
00:51:47,511 --> 00:51:48,511
You saw that, right?

599
00:51:48,691 --> 00:51:49,691
You were gonna leave me!

600
00:51:49,817 --> 00:51:51,446
- You saw it, right?
- I can't unsee it!

601
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:55,121
Where are we going?

602
00:51:55,257 --> 00:51:57,557
Away from here.
There's a highway up ahead.

603
00:51:57,806 --> 00:51:59,331
- How do you know?
- I know.

604
00:52:01,544 --> 00:52:03,828
Oh my God.
Do you realize what this is?

605
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,140
It's the dagger of Seth.

606
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:07,179
She was gonna drive that
thing right through me.

607
00:52:07,497 --> 00:52:09,184
The stone, it is missing.

608
00:52:09,499 --> 00:52:11,259
Yeah,
it seems to have really pissed her off.

609
00:52:11,317 --> 00:52:12,698
It's real.

610
00:52:17,098 --> 00:52:18,318
How was in that statue?

611
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:20,601
That statue was a reliquary.

612
00:52:20,801 --> 00:52:23,304
Crusaders have been using them
to hide holy relics.

613
00:52:24,886 --> 00:52:26,219
But she knew it was there.

614
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:30,965
You are saying that she brought
the plane down there? On purpose?

615
00:52:31,228 --> 00:52:33,101
That's why she wanted you
to come to the church.

616
00:52:33,102 --> 00:52:34,312
She wanted me to go to the church?

617
00:52:34,313 --> 00:52:36,297
I told you that I
wanted to go to church.

618
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:38,976
I told you.. I said..
That I wanted to see...

619
00:52:40,328 --> 00:52:43,705
- I wanted to see her corpse.
- See her corpse.

620
00:52:46,187 --> 00:52:49,094
Nick she is in your head.

621
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:52,032
What are you talking about?
That.. that is ridiculous. Because I...

622
00:52:56,794 --> 00:52:58,133
I drove right back to her.

623
00:52:58,339 --> 00:52:59,819
Oh my God she is in my head.

624
00:53:13,556 --> 00:53:14,724
Go go go go go!

625
00:53:28,088 --> 00:53:29,602
Get it off of me!

626
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,165
Son of a bitch!

627
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
That's my face! That's my face!

628
00:53:57,482 --> 00:53:58,493
Sorry!

629
00:54:01,891 --> 00:54:02,891
Nick!

630
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Nick!

631
00:54:34,835 --> 00:54:35,946
Jenny?

632
00:54:39,183 --> 00:54:40,993
Jenny.

633
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,442
Nick!

634
00:54:57,668 --> 00:54:58,733
Okay.

635
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,119
Alright.

636
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:02,365
Get her, Nick!

637
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:05,946
Get her! Get her!

638
00:55:08,156 --> 00:55:09,156
Kick her ass!

639
00:55:28,542 --> 00:55:29,542
Phase two! Quick!

640
00:55:37,896 --> 00:55:39,027
Pull her back!

641
00:55:43,566 --> 00:55:45,164
Delta team move!

642
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,470
Bring the target down!

643
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:03,370
Who are you?

644
00:56:23,508 --> 00:56:24,637
Where are you taking me?

645
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,009
What's happening?

646
00:57:14,219 --> 00:57:15,287
Stay.

647
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,963
Make yourself comfortable.

648
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:42,735
Who the hell are you?

649
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:44,577
Who am I?

650
00:57:46,326 --> 00:57:48,970
The more relevant question, Mr.
Morton...

651
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:51,766
...is: Who exactly are you?

652
00:57:53,225 --> 00:57:55,348
In theory, I know all about you.

653
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:59,214
Army reconnaissance,
decorated soldier...

654
00:57:59,482 --> 00:58:02,992
...and page after page indicating
a deep and troubling moral attitude.

655
00:58:02,993 --> 00:58:05,973
But you see, this file contains nothing
of any real value to me.

656
00:58:05,974 --> 00:58:07,848
That's why I wanted to
see you face to face.

657
00:58:09,558 --> 00:58:10,693
Who are you?

658
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:12,432
I am a doctor.

659
00:58:12,646 --> 00:58:13,667
Doctor.

660
00:58:14,227 --> 00:58:17,877
Chemical pathology, neurosurgery.
Member of the Royal Society.

661
00:58:19,421 --> 00:58:20,778
I am also a lawyer.

662
00:58:22,049 --> 00:58:23,200
My name is Jekyll.

663
00:58:25,104 --> 00:58:26,478
Dr. Henry Jekyll.

664
00:58:28,488 --> 00:58:29,488
There you are.

665
00:58:31,222 --> 00:58:34,975
This days,
I specialize in immunology, perhaps.

666
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:39,480
Infectious diseases perhaps.

667
00:58:40,258 --> 00:58:42,989
I would like to, If I may, Mr.
Morton...

668
00:58:44,497 --> 00:58:45,782
...to tell you a story.

669
00:58:47,144 --> 00:58:50,093
A story about a patient of mine.

670
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:53,028
A man of promise.

671
00:58:53,502 --> 00:58:55,453
A man who believed he
was beyond reproach...

672
00:58:56,693 --> 00:58:58,689
...until he got ill.

673
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:02,068
The disease manifested itself
in subtle ways at first.

674
00:59:03,111 --> 00:59:04,629
And then it grew...

675
00:59:05,057 --> 00:59:07,212
...into an overwhelming desire...

676
00:59:07,732 --> 00:59:09,212
...an unquenchable thirst...

677
00:59:14,804 --> 00:59:15,921
...for chaos.

678
00:59:16,932 --> 00:59:19,410
For the suffering of others.

679
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:39,834
He was quite fortunate.

680
00:59:40,841 --> 00:59:42,721
He himself was a physician.

681
00:59:43,243 --> 00:59:45,520
And if evil were a pathogen,
to be reasoned...

682
00:59:45,795 --> 00:59:48,395
...then there must surely be a cure.

683
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,119
I would like to, If I may, Mr.
Morton...

684
00:59:53,196 --> 00:59:54,840
...to show you something.

685
01:00:21,438 --> 01:00:24,135
Welcome to Prodigium,
Mr. Morton.

686
01:00:24,783 --> 01:00:28,481
From the Latin:
"Monstrum Vel Prodigium".

687
01:00:29,498 --> 01:00:31,746
"A warning of monsters".

688
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:33,792
Forgive the state of things.

689
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,104
We had very little time
to prepare for our guest.

690
01:00:36,404 --> 01:00:38,444
And only the information
Jennifer provided to go on.

691
01:00:40,205 --> 01:00:42,346
In truth, she works for us.

692
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:45,241
It's not an exact
science, this business.

693
01:00:48,007 --> 01:00:49,708
And the business being?

694
01:00:50,276 --> 01:00:52,545
Evil, Mr. Morton.

695
01:00:53,569 --> 01:00:57,960
Recognized, contained,
examined, destroyed.

696
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:03,778
She is, by far, the most ancient
we have ever encountered.

697
01:01:09,197 --> 01:01:10,237
What are you doing to her?

698
01:01:11,715 --> 01:01:13,747
Embalming her with mercury.

699
01:01:14,569 --> 01:01:16,809
At -38 degrees...

700
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,701
...the mercury in her veins
will solidify...

701
01:01:19,978 --> 01:01:21,903
...and she should be
safe for dissection then.

702
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:24,952
Dissection? You said
that we'd study her.

703
01:01:25,157 --> 01:01:27,015
Yes, by dissection.

704
01:01:27,415 --> 01:01:30,216
But she is a living witness
to a history that we barely know.

705
01:01:30,456 --> 01:01:31,496
She is a threat, Jennifer.

706
01:01:31,633 --> 01:01:33,889
Hold on, hold on.
So.. where does that leave me?

707
01:01:34,405 --> 01:01:36,744
Cursed, Mr. Morton.

708
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,104
This is not some common cold you have.

709
01:01:39,365 --> 01:01:42,717
Some chicken soup and a good night
sleep will not make it go away.

710
01:01:43,145 --> 01:01:45,046
You have been selected...

711
01:01:45,565 --> 01:01:47,722
...as the vessel for the ultimate evil.

712
01:01:48,022 --> 01:01:50,666
And we are the only ones
who can rectify that.

713
01:01:51,322 --> 01:01:54,133
YOU CANNOT CHANGE YOUR FATE.

714
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:00,723
THE CURSE WILL NEVER BE BROKEN.

715
01:02:03,942 --> 01:02:07,077
MY CHOSEN ONE WAS MURDERED.

716
01:02:08,706 --> 01:02:11,842
YOU WILL TAKE HIS PLACE.

717
01:02:17,827 --> 01:02:19,207
BUT IF YOU CHOOSE HIM...

718
01:02:19,727 --> 01:02:20,504
No.

719
01:02:20,687 --> 01:02:23,931
WHY WERE YOU GOING TO KILL HIM?

720
01:02:24,865 --> 01:02:27,146
I WAS NOT GOING TO KILL HIM.

721
01:02:30,678 --> 01:02:32,516
I was going to give him...

722
01:02:33,276 --> 01:02:34,904
...eternal life.

723
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:40,109
Make it a living God.

724
01:02:41,757 --> 01:02:43,141
You murdered your father.

725
01:02:44,059 --> 01:02:45,372
I loved my father...

726
01:02:45,857 --> 01:02:47,725
...with all my heart.

727
01:02:48,534 --> 01:02:53,115
I only wanted his love in return.

728
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:54,861
You killed his wife.

729
01:02:56,579 --> 01:02:57,711
Their child.

730
01:03:02,536 --> 01:03:05,840
They were different times.

731
01:03:15,184 --> 01:03:18,639
<i>The day of the awakening will
soon be upon us.</i>

732
01:03:19,316 --> 01:03:22,107
<i>You will become Seth.</i>

733
01:03:23,141 --> 01:03:27,056
<i>The world will fall to your desire.</i>

734
01:03:28,243 --> 01:03:32,120
<i>You will have power of life over death.</i>

735
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:36,968
<i>And you will have me.</i>

736
01:03:37,245 --> 01:03:40,098
<i>I will be your queen.</i>

737
01:03:40,299 --> 01:03:42,591
<i>Just give in.</i>

738
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:44,070
<i>Nick.</i>

739
01:03:45,821 --> 01:03:47,744
Nick, wake up.

740
01:03:48,003 --> 01:03:49,482
Wake up.

741
01:03:51,193 --> 01:03:52,613
They will kill you...

742
01:03:52,847 --> 01:03:55,584
...just as they killed
my chosen before you.

743
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:07,891
It burns.

744
01:04:11,623 --> 01:04:12,710
What?

745
01:04:13,796 --> 01:04:15,479
It Burns!

746
01:04:19,093 --> 01:04:20,176
Stop it!

747
01:04:20,395 --> 01:04:21,395
Stop it!

748
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:23,003
Stop!

749
01:04:24,463 --> 01:04:25,463
Stop it!

750
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,612
Stop!

751
01:04:28,256 --> 01:04:29,955
Fascinating.

752
01:04:43,299 --> 01:04:45,127
What was I supposed to tell you?

753
01:04:46,486 --> 01:04:50,561
Would you even have believed me if
I said that this place was real?

754
01:04:51,378 --> 01:04:52,485
When Henry came to me...

755
01:04:52,746 --> 01:04:55,461
...i took the job because
we had a common interest.

756
01:04:57,132 --> 01:04:59,161
So you are using each other.

757
01:05:00,488 --> 01:05:02,503
Now, she's using you.

758
01:05:10,108 --> 01:05:11,108
Look.

759
01:05:11,649 --> 01:05:13,888
Despite what you might think...

760
01:05:14,865 --> 01:05:15,953
...despite my...

761
01:05:17,407 --> 01:05:18,959
...my better judgment...

762
01:05:20,629 --> 01:05:22,121
...i care about you.

763
01:05:23,868 --> 01:05:26,481
Somewhere in there,
fighting to get out...

764
01:05:26,753 --> 01:05:28,268
...is a good man.

765
01:05:29,271 --> 01:05:31,201
You don't know that.

766
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:32,892
I do.

767
01:05:36,951 --> 01:05:38,391
How?

768
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,826
You saved my life on that plane.

769
01:05:43,491 --> 01:05:46,807
You gave me the only
parachute without hesitation.

770
01:05:53,493 --> 01:05:56,173
I thought there was another one.

771
01:06:02,901 --> 01:06:04,632
Mr. Morton.

772
01:06:06,231 --> 01:06:07,448
Drink?

773
01:06:30,001 --> 01:06:31,710
I think I found something.

774
01:06:50,161 --> 01:06:53,601
WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN...

775
01:06:57,087 --> 01:06:59,921
WHAT YOU MUST KNOW...

776
01:07:00,943 --> 01:07:03,790
I HAVE STUDIED THE WORD
OF THE OLD GODS.

777
01:07:05,273 --> 01:07:09,561
The old Gods?

778
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:16,900
Your language is simple.

779
01:07:18,461 --> 01:07:21,515
What you truly wish to know...

780
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:26,863
...is what lies beyond
the veil of death.

781
01:07:28,218 --> 01:07:32,595
To know what I have seen?

782
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:34,540
Yes.

783
01:07:35,204 --> 01:07:37,003
And you will...

784
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:42,890
...when I kill you.

785
01:07:48,467 --> 01:07:51,132
They have found the stone.

786
01:07:52,763 --> 01:07:55,645
You brought my chosen here.

787
01:07:56,944 --> 01:08:01,441
What do you think they
will do with him now?

788
01:08:19,506 --> 01:08:21,058
Welcome to a new world...

789
01:08:21,292 --> 01:08:23,581
...of Gods and monsters.

790
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,338
Evil has many names,
Mr. Morton.

791
01:08:29,265 --> 01:08:30,886
Take Seth, for example.

792
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,737
Known to Egyptians as the God of death.

793
01:08:34,646 --> 01:08:36,925
In the Old Testament: Satan, Lucifer.

794
01:08:37,505 --> 01:08:39,042
- The Devil.
- Quite so.

795
01:08:39,236 --> 01:08:40,797
Yeah. Bad.. bad.. gotta..

796
01:08:41,135 --> 01:08:44,322
You see Evil is the shadow
that exists just outside our world...

797
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:48,736
...continuously searching for
a way to come in...

798
01:08:50,207 --> 01:08:52,772
...for a way to become flesh and blood.

799
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:07,953
Either.. we wait for
that day to arrive...

800
01:09:08,808 --> 01:09:11,442
...or we can fight it on our own terms.

801
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:13,347
Which brings me to you.

802
01:09:13,596 --> 01:09:15,695
Me? Yeah, great, yes.. doc.

803
01:09:16,355 --> 01:09:19,390
You said that you could cure
me of this curse. Get rid of it.

804
01:09:19,718 --> 01:09:21,737
So, let's do it doc.

805
01:09:22,513 --> 01:09:23,618
What's your plan?

806
01:09:25,381 --> 01:09:27,782
Mr. Morton,
these things are complex.

807
01:09:28,132 --> 01:09:29,345
Yeah? I bet, I bet.

808
01:09:30,178 --> 01:09:33,008
When one is dealing with the
salvation of humanity...

809
01:09:34,112 --> 01:09:36,413
...certain sacrifices must be made.

810
01:09:36,518 --> 01:09:37,958
Excuse me, sir.

811
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:41,985
They found it.

812
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:44,098
What found.. what?

813
01:09:46,059 --> 01:09:47,059
Henry.

814
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:49,787
Are you planning on killing him?

815
01:09:50,059 --> 01:09:50,861
Kill him?

816
01:09:51,056 --> 01:09:52,311
- Jennifer...
- Kill who?

817
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:55,150
Mr. Morton here essentially
killed himself...

818
01:09:55,506 --> 01:09:57,258
...when he severed the barrier chain...

819
01:09:57,416 --> 01:09:59,850
...that had kept Ahmanet power
imprisoned for 5,000 years.

820
01:10:03,752 --> 01:10:07,108
He was chosen as her ideal candidate.

821
01:10:07,702 --> 01:10:10,752
A thief, physically capable,
compulsively devious...

822
01:10:11,018 --> 01:10:12,339
...and utterly devoid of soul.

823
01:10:12,518 --> 01:10:13,734
- What?
- What?

824
01:10:13,981 --> 01:10:14,981
That's insane.

825
01:10:15,148 --> 01:10:17,668
Do you want to put the stone in
the dagger and stab him with it?

826
01:10:17,764 --> 01:10:20,353
The dagger will allow
Seth to enter his body.

827
01:10:20,662 --> 01:10:22,848
And then we obliterate it.

828
01:10:23,065 --> 01:10:24,065
Wait, wait, wait.

829
01:10:24,149 --> 01:10:27,051
Do you want to stab me with that thing?
Intentionally?

830
01:10:27,286 --> 01:10:29,521
Precisely what the
Egyptians should have done.

831
01:10:32,466 --> 01:10:35,036
You see,
they interrupted a ritual in process...

832
01:10:35,233 --> 01:10:38,030
...and that is mistake we cannot...

833
01:10:39,812 --> 01:10:41,052
...afford to repeat.

834
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,775
- That's the plan?
- Henry...

835
01:10:44,943 --> 01:10:46,183
...you can't possibly do this.

836
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:48,208
That's your plan?

837
01:10:48,486 --> 01:10:50,858
The dominoes are already falling.

838
01:10:51,156 --> 01:10:52,355
We haven't much time.

839
01:10:52,654 --> 01:10:56,076
Unfortunately, it is
a risk we must take.

840
01:10:56,408 --> 01:10:57,817
That's really your plan?

841
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:02,469
You heard Ahmanet.
Your curse cannot be broken.

842
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:08,709
I am truly sorry, Mr. Morton.
No matter what I do, you are going to die.

843
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:12,990
Yes, evil is a disease.

844
01:11:12,991 --> 01:11:15,515
A pestilent pustulant infection...

845
01:11:15,516 --> 01:11:18,602
...borrowing its way into our souls.

846
01:11:18,603 --> 01:11:20,827
The world needs a cure.

847
01:11:20,828 --> 01:11:22,228
You can be that cure.

848
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:23,229
Stop.

849
01:11:23,299 --> 01:11:24,816
A sacrifice for the greater good!

850
01:11:24,817 --> 01:11:27,572
I'm not interested in that at all.

851
01:11:27,573 --> 01:11:28,350
Okay.

852
01:11:28,518 --> 01:11:29,648
- Don't!
- Give me the injector.

853
01:11:29,649 --> 01:11:31,074
We are just gonna take a minute...

854
01:11:31,075 --> 01:11:32,994
...and we are all gonna come
up with a new plan.

855
01:11:32,995 --> 01:11:33,720
We have to go.

856
01:11:33,809 --> 01:11:34,899
You don't know
what you are doing.

857
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,389
Really? I know exactly what I'm doing.

858
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:39,015
Oh my dear Henry Jekyll...

859
01:11:39,016 --> 01:11:42,004
...if ever I've seen Satan
signature upon a face...

860
01:11:42,005 --> 01:11:44,526
...is on that of your new friend.

861
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:47,174
Hey, hey hey! Take it!

862
01:11:47,397 --> 01:11:48,515
Now!

863
01:11:48,766 --> 01:11:50,277
- Run, Mr. Morton.
- What?

864
01:11:50,563 --> 01:11:51,991
Run!

865
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,135
Nick! Open the door!

866
01:12:01,328 --> 01:12:02,334
You don't want that.

867
01:12:04,078 --> 01:12:05,223
Stop, Jenny!

868
01:12:05,548 --> 01:12:06,554
Stop!

869
01:12:27,939 --> 01:12:31,302
They won't let me out, Nicholas.
They never do.

870
01:12:38,414 --> 01:12:40,894
Woah woah what's happening?
Did you just shut down the mercury?

871
01:12:41,169 --> 01:12:42,183
Pete?

872
01:12:54,691 --> 01:12:56,665
You are a younger man...

873
01:12:56,886 --> 01:12:59,271
...but you must learn to be wary
of a man like me.

874
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:13,229
It's not me that wants to kill you,
it's Henry.

875
01:13:14,284 --> 01:13:16,044
I have something more
collaborative in mind.

876
01:13:37,845 --> 01:13:39,281
I'm offering you a partnership.

877
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:42,954
You, evil incarnate.
Me, your good friend, Eddie Hyde.

878
01:13:43,154 --> 01:13:44,154
Think about it.

879
01:13:44,925 --> 01:13:45,963
Jenny!

880
01:13:47,743 --> 01:13:48,743
Come on.

881
01:14:10,628 --> 01:14:11,881
Jenny, stop!

882
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:19,182
Come on, son.
Think about it.

883
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:21,523
I am chaos, destruction.

884
01:14:21,818 --> 01:14:23,099
The ladies will love us.

885
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:25,719
Come here.

886
01:14:29,675 --> 01:14:31,999
I do enjoy the garments of pain.

887
01:14:46,722 --> 01:14:49,422
Well done, Mr. Morton.
Well done.

888
01:15:06,243 --> 01:15:08,304
Come on.
We have to destroy the stone.

889
01:15:08,593 --> 01:15:09,593
What?

890
01:15:09,625 --> 01:15:10,625
No stone, no ritual.

891
01:15:10,859 --> 01:15:11,859
No ritual...

892
01:15:11,931 --> 01:15:14,396
- ...No curse.
- Yes. I know where it is.

893
01:16:13,275 --> 01:16:16,411
- Wait, wait, which way out?
- I don't know.

894
01:16:17,226 --> 01:16:18,312
GOD OF DEATH...

895
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,477
BRING FORTH MY CHOSEN...

896
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,216
I SUMMON THE SANDS OF EGYPT...

897
01:16:30,571 --> 01:16:32,798
TAKE ME IN!

898
01:16:36,799 --> 01:16:39,799
DELIVER HIM TO ME!

899
01:17:08,034 --> 01:17:09,034
Hello?

900
01:17:09,232 --> 01:17:11,447
She's out! She has the dagger.

901
01:17:11,648 --> 01:17:13,288
We thinks she is coming
to you, so are we.

902
01:17:13,569 --> 01:17:16,032
<i>Lock your doors and secure that stone.</i>

903
01:18:22,294 --> 01:18:23,751
Nick!

904
01:18:23,995 --> 01:18:25,133
Nick, let's go!

905
01:18:25,361 --> 01:18:26,879
I know where the stone is!

906
01:18:27,052 --> 01:18:28,052
Let's go!

907
01:18:46,232 --> 01:18:48,524
Wow, that was intense!

908
01:18:50,634 --> 01:18:52,111
Okay, follow me.

909
01:18:55,637 --> 01:18:57,483
<i>We are headed to the
crusader burial chamber.</i>

910
01:18:58,012 --> 01:19:00,857
<i>We'll make our entry through the
northwest trade tunnels, over.</i>

911
01:19:12,438 --> 01:19:14,189
This is the moment, Nick.

912
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:15,863
This is the moment!

913
01:19:16,064 --> 01:19:17,392
Yes, you are damn right.

914
01:19:17,718 --> 01:19:20,249
I'm gonna taking that stone,
Deliver you to Ahmanet...

915
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
...and then my work here is done.
What?
Nick?
Jenny?

916
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:34,068
Hey, buddy.

917
01:19:34,288 --> 01:19:37,908
Ahmanet is never going to let her live.

918
01:19:38,687 --> 01:19:39,929
You can't save her.

919
01:19:41,713 --> 01:19:45,512
ARISE, MY WARRIORS, AND SERVE ME.

920
01:19:56,509 --> 01:19:58,338
No! Oh no!

921
01:20:22,774 --> 01:20:23,915
Nick?

922
01:20:34,944 --> 01:20:35,996
Nick?

923
01:20:37,405 --> 01:20:38,405
Nick?

924
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

925
01:21:17,635 --> 01:21:18,635
You shouldn't be here.

926
01:21:18,804 --> 01:21:19,804
I followed you!

927
01:21:22,287 --> 01:21:23,481
Go go go!

928
01:22:58,539 --> 01:22:59,539
We are okay?

929
01:22:59,751 --> 01:23:01,045
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

930
01:23:03,595 --> 01:23:05,116
Are you okay?

931
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:07,117
- I'm scared.
- Just look at me.

932
01:23:07,321 --> 01:23:08,971
We are gonna figure this out.

933
01:23:09,148 --> 01:23:11,095
Just, I need you to just
stay with me, please.

934
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
We are gonna figure this out..
I need you to just stay with me.
Just stay with me.
We'll think of something.

935
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:23,759
No! Jenny!

936
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,487
Jenny! No!

937
01:25:07,746 --> 01:25:08,874
No!

938
01:25:09,138 --> 01:25:10,585
Let go!

939
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:20,220
Jenny!

940
01:25:22,035 --> 01:25:23,035
No!

941
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:48,173
Don't blame yourself.

942
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,939
She was always doomed.

943
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:12,947
There are worse fates than death.

944
01:26:27,877 --> 01:26:29,079
Come to me.

945
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:51,973
It hurts.

946
01:26:52,828 --> 01:26:53,908
I know.

947
01:26:54,916 --> 01:26:57,927
Let me take pain away.

948
01:27:23,733 --> 01:27:25,088
Give in to me.

949
01:27:59,522 --> 01:28:00,891
Give in.

950
01:28:01,822 --> 01:28:03,717
Give in.

951
01:28:06,062 --> 01:28:07,239
When it's over...

952
01:28:08,795 --> 01:28:10,664
...you will thank me.

953
01:28:11,851 --> 01:28:13,526
I promise.

954
01:28:19,726 --> 01:28:20,975
I'm sorry.

955
01:28:22,979 --> 01:28:24,940
We are just never gonna happen.

956
01:28:26,589 --> 01:28:28,040
And it's not me.

957
01:28:29,876 --> 01:28:31,001
It's you.

958
01:28:53,373 --> 01:28:55,045
Thief.

959
01:29:04,961 --> 01:29:06,220
Wait!

960
01:29:07,647 --> 01:29:09,147
Destroy the stone...

961
01:29:09,432 --> 01:29:12,248
...and all is lost.

962
01:29:13,572 --> 01:29:17,612
You will be a living God.

963
01:29:18,973 --> 01:29:24,850
You will have power of life over death.

964
01:29:30,749 --> 01:29:32,205
Give it to me...

965
01:29:34,194 --> 01:29:35,660
...my chosen.

966
01:29:41,036 --> 01:29:42,876
Give it to me...

967
01:29:43,325 --> 01:29:44,805
...my love.

968
01:31:38,681 --> 01:31:39,681
Somewhere in there...

969
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:42,006
...I know you're a good man.

970
01:31:53,396 --> 01:31:55,005
The world needs a cure.

971
01:31:55,236 --> 01:31:56,701
You can be that cure.

972
01:31:58,625 --> 01:32:00,672
A sacrifice for the greater good!

973
01:33:06,112 --> 01:33:07,112
Jenny.

974
01:33:07,826 --> 01:33:08,826
Jenny.

975
01:33:09,715 --> 01:33:10,880
Wake up.

976
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,382
Wake up.

977
01:33:17,753 --> 01:33:18,753
I'm sorry.

978
01:33:19,463 --> 01:33:20,733
I'm sorry, Jenny.

979
01:33:24,183 --> 01:33:25,183
Jenny.

980
01:33:29,368 --> 01:33:31,020
Jenny, please wake up.

981
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:34,483
I'm sorry.

982
01:33:34,803 --> 01:33:36,881
I do not know what I'm doing.

983
01:33:37,084 --> 01:33:38,084
Please wake up.

984
01:33:42,571 --> 01:33:43,571
Jenny.

985
01:33:44,272 --> 01:33:45,345
Wake up, please.

986
01:33:47,075 --> 01:33:48,084
Just...

987
01:33:49,537 --> 01:33:51,953
Jenny, just wake up!

988
01:34:07,232 --> 01:34:09,000
Nick?

989
01:34:11,252 --> 01:34:13,126
Nick!

990
01:34:50,779 --> 01:34:51,779
Nick.

991
01:34:52,235 --> 01:34:54,484
Nick?

992
01:34:54,737 --> 01:34:55,871
Stop!

993
01:34:56,449 --> 01:34:58,240
Stop. Please.

994
01:35:01,408 --> 01:35:03,754
I don't know what I am.

995
01:35:05,174 --> 01:35:07,765
I don't want to hurt you, Jenny.

996
01:35:08,016 --> 01:35:09,016
You are alive.

997
01:35:09,791 --> 01:35:11,119
You are alive.

998
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,560
I'm so glad you're alive.

999
01:35:15,892 --> 01:35:17,298
Oh Nick.

1000
01:35:18,723 --> 01:35:21,555
You did this for me?

1001
01:35:23,013 --> 01:35:24,198
Yes.

1002
01:35:25,754 --> 01:35:27,844
I have made so many...

1003
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:29,702
...many mistakes.

1004
01:35:31,899 --> 01:35:33,300
But not this time.

1005
01:35:34,382 --> 01:35:35,972
Not you.

1006
01:35:38,279 --> 01:35:40,090
I don't want to hurt you.

1007
01:35:41,501 --> 01:35:43,334
I never wanted to hurt you.

1008
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:46,003
You won't.

1009
01:35:49,531 --> 01:35:51,658
We didn't see this coming, did we?

1010
01:35:59,479 --> 01:36:01,182
They are coming for me.

1011
01:36:03,882 --> 01:36:06,283
I wish we had more time.

1012
01:36:08,466 --> 01:36:09,930
I'll find you.

1013
01:36:11,567 --> 01:36:13,905
Goodbye, Jenny.

1014
01:36:47,928 --> 01:36:49,550
You were wrong about Nick.

1015
01:36:50,536 --> 01:36:52,917
He gave his life to save me.

1016
01:36:54,711 --> 01:36:56,251
<i>To bring me back.</i>

1017
01:37:00,458 --> 01:37:01,458
<i>Yes, Jennifer.</i>

1018
01:37:02,533 --> 01:37:04,978
<i>He found his redemption.</i>

1019
01:37:05,339 --> 01:37:06,901
<i>But at great cost.</i>

1020
01:37:08,514 --> 01:37:10,322
He is a monster now.

1021
01:37:11,439 --> 01:37:13,676
<i>He is also still a man.</i>

1022
01:37:14,314 --> 01:37:15,815
<i>A good man.</i>

1023
01:37:16,511 --> 01:37:18,020
<i>Perhaps.</i>

1024
01:37:18,715 --> 01:37:21,357
<i>Yet it has only begun
to discover his power.</i>

1025
01:37:22,516 --> 01:37:25,003
<i>And we cannot know which
side will win out.</i>

1026
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:28,829
Between Darkness and light...

1027
01:37:29,991 --> 01:37:31,530
<i>...good or evil.</i>

1028
01:37:32,391 --> 01:37:33,617
Hey, Nick.

1029
01:37:33,816 --> 01:37:34,816
Nick.

1030
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:38,242
I'm really glad to be here.

1031
01:37:39,307 --> 01:37:42,184
I mean, thank you for bringing me
back to life and everything, Nick...

1032
01:37:42,358 --> 01:37:44,410
...but what are we even doing here?

1033
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:46,689
Where are we going?

1034
01:37:46,933 --> 01:37:48,481
Come on, my friend.

1035
01:37:50,113 --> 01:37:51,930
Where is your sense of adventure?

1036
01:37:56,778 --> 01:37:57,952
Oh No.

1037
01:37:59,118 --> 01:38:01,144
<i>Whatever human part of him remains...</i>

1038
01:38:01,902 --> 01:38:03,628
...will search the world over...

1039
01:38:04,468 --> 01:38:06,021
...for a way to break the curse.

1040
01:38:06,825 --> 01:38:08,171
<i>To find the cure.</i>

1041
01:38:09,423 --> 01:38:11,442
<i>Yet evil never rests.</i>

1042
01:38:12,348 --> 01:38:13,824
<i>And you will call to them...</i>

1043
01:38:14,743 --> 01:38:16,479
<i>...always.</i>

1044
01:38:16,849 --> 01:38:20,418
<i>Henry, he used his power
to stop Ahmanet.</i>

1045
01:38:20,608 --> 01:38:24,800
<i>You know more than anyone he
could be our greatest ally.</i>

1046
01:38:26,554 --> 01:38:27,691
<i>Perhaps.</i>

1047
01:38:28,609 --> 01:38:30,955
<i>Sometimes it does take a monster...</i>

1048
01:38:31,231 --> 01:38:33,071
<i>...to fight a monster.</i>

1049
01:38:36,101 --> 01:38:47,101
