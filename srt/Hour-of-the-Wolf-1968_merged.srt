1
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,234
The painter Johan Borg

2
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,802
disappeared some years ago

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,542
without a trace, from his home

4
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,948
on the island of Baltrum

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,180
in the Frisian Islands.

6
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,586
His wife Alma

7
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:26,489
later left me Johan's diary,

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,050
which she had found

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,620
among his papers.

10
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,429
This diary and Alma's account
are the basis of this film.

11
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:38,266
Can someone move that chair?

12
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,965
And lower that a little...

13
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,543
A Film by
Ingmar Bergman

14
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,175
Have you been...

15
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,034
Listen, we're not
quite finished yet.

16
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,703
No? All right.

17
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,095
Quiet, all!
Rolling!

18
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,155
Take!

19
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,366
Camera!

20
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,972
And begin.

21
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,978
No...

22
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,309
I have nothing more to tell.

23
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,457
I've given you the diary.

24
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,166
And you wonder why
I choose to stay on here?

25
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:53,270
We've lived in this house together
almost seven years.

26
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,100
Come winter,
I can move to the mainland,

27
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,204
work at the store
as I have done before

28
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,340
when money was short.

29
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,623
The baby is due in a month,
the doctor has said.

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,250
He examined me in May,

31
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,819
before the very last time
we came out here.

32
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,196
It was on a Friday,
I remember.

33
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,396
It was quite late...

34
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,338
about 10:00, I think.

35
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,171
But it was still light out.

36
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,416
We'd planned to stay here
until August.

37
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,957
We were going to be
completely alone.

38
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,394
He didn't want to see
another human being here.

39
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,953
He was afraid.

40
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,043
He liked that I was quiet.

41
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,780
He liked...

42
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,716
We got here
at about 3:00 in the morning.

43
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,922
We found a wheelbarrow
in a shed on the beach.

44
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:33,028
When we got here, we were happy
to see the apple tree in blossom.

45
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,803
Then we discovered footprints

46
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,037
under the kitchen window
in the flower bed.

47
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,580
It annoyed Johan,

48
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,116
but we forgot about it,
because...

49
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,949
Yes, we were happy.

50
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,423
We were happy to be home
in our own house again.

51
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,697
Johan was uneasy.

52
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,738
He always grew anxious
when his work did not go well,

53
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,296
and it had not gone well
for some time now.

54
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,341
And he became sleepless.

55
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:18,309
He was frightened,
as if he was afraid of the dark.

56
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,919
It had gotten worse
in the last few years.

57
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,076
- I know what.
- What?

58
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,144
- I'm going to draw you.
- No!

59
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,382
- Yes!
- Oh, no.

60
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,754
- Please let me!
- No.

61
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,690
- Yes, if you sit over there.
- No.

62
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,024
Oh, come on now.
Go on, Fatso!

63
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,863
- Here?
- A little farther back... there.

64
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,300
- Are you cold?
- No.

65
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,703
I knew that.

66
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,832
So sit, just sit
like you always do.

67
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,501
Don't straighten up.

68
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,478
And pull the coat down a little
over your shoulder...

69
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,410
...just like that,
and pull your hair up

70
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,817
so I can see your neck better.

71
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,646
Fine, that's right.
And where are my glasses?

72
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,627
And the damned bow
is broken again.

73
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,828
There, can you sit
just like that a moment?

74
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,338
If day after day,

75
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,877
I patiently drew you...

76
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,080
Hello!

77
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,475
Now, look...

78
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,003
I haven't shown these
to anyone.

79
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,140
You see,
I made sketches of them!

80
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,679
This is the one
who turns up most often.

81
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,744
And he's almost harmless.

82
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,823
I think he's homosexual.

83
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,854
And then there's the old lady,

84
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,490
the one always threatening
to take off her hat.

85
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,591
Do you know
what happens if she does?

86
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,769
Her face comes off
along with it, you see.

87
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,739
And here...

88
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,902
He's the worst of the lot.

89
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,604
I call him the Bird Man.

90
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,149
I don't know if it's a real beak
or only a mask.

91
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,219
He's so strangely quick...

92
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,586
<i>...and he's related
to Papageno of The Magic Flute.</i>

93
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,222
And the others!

94
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,360
The meat-eaters,
the insects...

95
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,862
...and especially
the spider men.

96
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,977
Here, the schoolmaster,
his pointer in his trousers.

97
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:34,681
And then all the cast-iron,
cackling women.

98
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,683
You must stay awake
a little while longer.

99
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,200
In just an hour or so
it will be dawn...

100
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,900
...and then I can sleep.

101
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,102
A minute is actually
an immense space of time.

102
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,173
Wait, here it starts.

103
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,421
Ten seconds.

104
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,598
These seconds...

105
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,332
You see how long they last?

106
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,842
The minute isn't over yet!

107
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,596
Ah, finally.

108
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,431
It's gone now.

109
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,813
Say something.

110
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,683
Talk to me, Alma.

111
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,888
Hey, you...

112
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,895
...there's something
I've thought about for a long time.

113
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,226
Are you listening?

114
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:12,342
We've lived together
for seven years now...

115
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,540
No, that's not
what I was going to say.

116
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,138
Now I know.

117
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:23,054
Isn't it true that old people
who have lived a lifetime together

118
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,454
start to resemble each other?

119
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,549
They finally share so much,

120
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:35,055
their thoughts and their faces
take on the same expression.

121
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,160
Why do you think that is?

122
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,844
I hope we will get so old
that we...

123
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,743
...think each other's thoughts...

124
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,380
...and we get little, dried-up,

125
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,050
identical wrinkled faces.

126
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,525
What do you think about that?

127
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,688
Are you sleeping?

128
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,065
Come now.

129
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,941
Let's go to bed now.

130
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,807
Okay.

131
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,032
Don't look so frightened, child.

132
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,966
I'm not dangerous.

133
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,868
Give me your hand.

134
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,907
Well?

135
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,272
Can you feel my hand now?

136
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,774
My fingers,

137
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,178
the veins under my skin?

138
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,145
At my age,
the hands can get a little cold.

139
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:11,187
I am, after all,
216 years old.

140
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,387
No, what am I saying?

141
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,190
Seventy-six, I mean.

142
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:24,093
No, I had better be
on my way now.

143
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:28,196
Now, what was it
I was going to say?

144
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,436
Now I remember.

145
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,344
In his black satchel
under the bed,

146
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:43,287
there's the sketchbook
with drawings...

147
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:47,485
Tell him not to do that.

148
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,652
And then one more thing.

149
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:54,256
He hides his diary
in the same satchel.

150
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,130
Read it!

151
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,872
No, no!

152
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:29,092
DIARY

153
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,767
<i>Wednesday, July 22nd.</i>

154
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,901
<i>I have recently been ill.</i>

155
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,311
<i>Not seriously,
but unpleasant enough.</i>

156
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,880
Pardon the interruption,
but I have pondered for days

157
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,787
how most appropriately
I might approach you.

158
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,325
I deemed it most polite
to get directly to the point.

159
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,226
My name is von Merkens,
Baron von Merkens.

160
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,456
Borg.

161
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,090
As you may know,
I own this island.

162
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,566
I live in the old castle
on the north side.

163
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,897
Would you and your wife
care to join us

164
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,270
for a simple family supper?

165
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,808
That's kind of you.

166
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,505
It will be very simple,
but I'll give you a good wine.

167
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,911
And our salmon fishing
is renowned.

168
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,212
Good-bye.

169
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:05,354
I should also say
that my wife and I

170
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:10,054
are among your admirers,
your... fondest admirers.

171
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,642
<i>Thursday, July 27th.</i>

172
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,711
<i>A very warm, hazy day.</i>

173
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,557
<i>I am still sickly after my illness.</i>

174
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,355
Do you see this mark?

175
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,296
Be more careful, my love,

176
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,804
or it will end in disaster.

177
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,168
Don't you remember?
I was leaving for a party,

178
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,574
and I was wearing
my green brocade dress.

179
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:10,445
Afterwards, I had such trouble
putting my hair up again!

180
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,779
And then I forgot my gloves.

181
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,350
I have something
I must speak to you about.

182
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,483
I've received a letter
that I must show you.

183
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,560
It was sent yesterday.

184
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,189
And here is what it says...

185
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,165
"You do not see us,
but we see you.

186
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:36,036
"The most horrible things
can happen.

187
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:39,474
"Dreams can become unveiled.

188
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,637
The end is near..."

189
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,405
"The wells will run dry,

190
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:49,511
"and other fluids
will moisten your white loins.

191
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,579
Thus is it decided."

192
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,023
I almost became ill reading it.

193
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,967
How hot your hands are.

194
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,025
Do you have a fever?

195
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,538
Before I see you,
I always get so wound up.

196
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,602
Can you understand that?

197
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,578
I wander as if in a dream
the whole afternoon.

198
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:24,515
All my chores become so unreal
and meaningless.

199
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,623
Be so kind as to help me
with the zipper in my dress.

200
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,688
It always gets caught.

201
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:31,618
A strong wind indeed!
But magnificent, is it not?

202
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,558
This place must be
a painter's dream or what?

203
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,027
I've lived here for quite a while.

204
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,724
One returns to the scene
of the crime, so to speak,

205
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,562
and commits new crimes!

206
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,896
You appear to be tired.
Don't over-exert yourself.

207
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,997
I mean, at our age,
a certain caution is to be advised.

208
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,941
Youth is of tougher mettle.

209
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,841
I happen to know.

210
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:57,006
My name is Heerbrand,
psychiatric curator.

211
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,710
I finger people's souls
and turn their insides out.

212
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,651
What do we see then?
I hardly need to tell you.

213
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,349
As an artist,
you know the human heart.

214
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,414
What don't you see
in your facial studies,

215
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,722
not to mention
in your self-portraits?

216
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,560
Why do you look at me like that?
Did I anger you?

217
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,828
Your nerves out of sorts?
Something plaguing you?

218
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,461
Shut up!

219
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,104
Shut up!

220
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,341
I think I need to ask you
for more money.

221
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,904
What you gave me this month
is almost gone.

222
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:41,645
We must pay the store
next time we go to the mainland.

223
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,690
The bill is 176.50,
and then there's the milk.

224
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,527
Don't just
shovel over money like that.

225
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,190
You have to look
at my accounting!

226
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:57,496
It's quite important,
at least to me.

227
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,061
I received 500 on the 3rd.

228
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,939
You bought me that blanket,
rather expensive -- 35.

229
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,672
But it's warm and lovely
when I lie alone.

230
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,714
And here's the previous bill
from the store.

231
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:15,310
It's high because we had to buy
flour, sugar, and canned goods.

232
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:19,083
Comes to over 200 kronor -- 219.

233
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,353
And there's pocket money
and stamps

234
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,421
and a chain for my bicycle

235
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,660
and new radio batteries...

236
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,760
...and the potato peeler...

237
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,805
...then soap,
washing powder, a nail brush.

238
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,336
You need a new toothbrush.
The one you have looks horrible.

239
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,507
- No.
- Well, it does.

240
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:53,119
Then 50 kronor
for your boy's birthday.

241
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,182
And postage -- 75 öre.

242
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,888
That's about 500 kronor.

243
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,590
7,36.

244
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,060
You can count it to be sure.

245
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,979
We're invited
to the castle on Friday.

246
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:25,488
I know.

247
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,287
How do you know that?

248
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,934
Good evening.

249
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,368
My wife Corinne.

250
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,497
You're very welcome.
Welcome.

251
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,065
My mother
Countess von Merkens.

252
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,502
My brother Ernst.

253
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,674
A pleasure.
A pleasure.

254
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:54,411
Here is Archivist Lindhorst.

255
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,783
Delighted. I am one
of your fondest admirers.

256
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,188
And this is Curator Heerbrand.

257
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,886
A pleasure.
I believe we've met already.

258
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,792
Would you like a drink?

259
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:13,194
- May I serve a little...
- Yes, by all means.

260
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,803
The summer heat
makes you so thirsty.

261
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,776
So how long have you
been there?

262
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,807
I thought you had been living here
for months,

263
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,613
we've been hearing
about you for so long!

264
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:32,645
Time flies so quickly!
Delighted you could come.

265
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:42,455
Damned awful housemaid.
But she's cheap, of course.

266
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,592
My brother cannot afford better.

267
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,399
I would like you all to observe
that the reason the soup...

268
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,373
We live in one place now.
We used to travel a lot.

269
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:54,673
Do you enjoy travel?
Nothing is as stimulating.

270
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,839
Alma is an unusual
and beautiful name.

271
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,543
I'm completely incapable
of feeling aggression.

272
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,608
I can muster
bureaucratic vengefulness...

273
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:06,020
Here, we're used to humiliation.
We find it pleasurable...

274
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,751
...our fangs
have remained intact.

275
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,918
Nowadays I want to be loved.

276
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:13,691
I once bought a painting
from a well-known artist.

277
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,096
No comments now, Ernst!

278
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,157
Then I hung it
upside down in my salon

279
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,829
and invited the artist over,
along with a lot of people

280
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,895
who appreciated
a good joke!

281
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:25,374
What a laugh we had then!
My God, how we laughed.

282
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,037
What do you say, sir Artist?
Wasn't that a fine joke?

283
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:33,077
...the sores never heal,
the pus never ceases to flow.

284
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:38,111
The infection is constant -- worse,
faster, or slower towards the end.

285
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,885
The resistance of the heart
decides the outcome.

286
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,620
I am constantly losing weight.

287
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,822
I travel the world over
consulting specialists.

288
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,888
Sometimes the loss just stops,

289
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,730
as it did this summer,
but then it starts again.

290
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,895
My husband says
it's psychological,

291
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,098
that it all began
when we lost our money.

292
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,232
I embezzled the family fortune!

293
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,744
- I am the guilty one!
- We've heard this...

294
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,508
Why is Lindhorst sitting
at our table?

295
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,446
Can't we just sell and leave?

296
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,576
My fault, my fault,
all this suffering.

297
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,984
My fault!

298
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:14,150
And then I shouted,
"To hell with your medicines!

299
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:17,285
"It won't go away.
It will never go away!

300
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:21,093
"You must operate it away.
You must just slice it off!

301
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,760
I am an old hag.
There must be a limit!"

302
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,272
And then he laughed and said,

303
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,068
"No, madame Countess,

304
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:33,633
I have never heard
of any limits at all!"

305
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,141
Yes, we have children,
two boys.

306
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,811
Oh, no, not here.
They live with an uncle...

307
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,480
whom I believe
is an acquaintance?

308
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,546
I understand you know
Veronica Vogler.

309
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,149
And very well,
after what I've heard.

310
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,728
An extraordinarily
beautiful woman.

311
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,457
Veronica Vogler is charming!

312
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,329
Have you also met her?
Truly very charming.

313
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,425
No?

314
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,701
Such hatred in those eyes!

315
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:11,539
Fredrik, the cacti you planted
need to go!

316
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,210
I mean, I don't enjoy them at all.

317
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,831
Actually, I am allergic to them.

318
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,838
You shouldn't drag them along...

319
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,179
All right, then! We shall take
coffee in the library.

320
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:14,610
- Help me a little.
- Yes...

321
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,502
Ladies and gentlemen!
Your attention!

322
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,301
May I offer
a small puppet show to divert us?

323
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,866
Can we extinguish the lights?

324
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,077
There. Good.

325
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,605
Our guests of honor.

326
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:58,622
Come, come.
There.

327
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,001
Music.

328
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,736
<i>The Magic Flute
is the greatest example.</i>

329
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,903
One moment.
I shall prove this presently.

330
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:08,148
Tamino's guides have just
left him in the dark courtyard

331
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,551
outside the Temple of Wisdom.

332
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,748
The young man cries
in deepest despair,

333
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:16,691
"Oh, eternal night,
when shalt thou pass?

334
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:20,857
When shall the light
find my eyes?"

335
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:27,537
The fatally ill Mozart
secretly empathizes with these words.

336
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,768
And the reply from the chorus
and orchestra is also,

337
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,241
"Soon, soon, youth..."

338
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,568
"...or never."

339
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,438
The most beautiful,

340
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:44,420
the most shattering music
ever written.

341
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,154
Tamino asks,

342
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,250
"Is Pamina still alive?"

343
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,195
The invisible chorus answers,

344
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:57,200
"Pamina, Pamina is still alive."

345
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,731
Hear...

346
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:05,606
the strange and illogical
but genial rhythm...

347
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,536
Pami... na.

348
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:19,022
This is no longer the name
of a young woman...

349
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:24,318
...but an incantation,
a sorcerer's formula.

350
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:28,457
A naïve text --
in short, a commission...

351
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:32,202
and yet the highest
manifestation of art.

352
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,499
Would you not agree,
sir Artist?

353
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,063
Pardon me.

354
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:40,474
I call myself "artist"
for want of a better term.

355
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,411
There is nothing self-evident
in my creative work

356
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,472
except the compulsion to do it.

357
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,540
Through no intent of my own,

358
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:50,052
I have been pointed out
as something apart,

359
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,316
a five-legged calf,
a monster.

360
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,381
I have never fought
for that position,

361
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:57,450
nor do I do so now to keep it.

362
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,223
Yet I may well at times

363
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,459
have felt the winds of megalomania
sweep across my brow.

364
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,592
But I believe myself
to be immune.

365
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,829
I need only for one second
remind myself

366
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:10,567
of the utter unimportance of art
in the human world

367
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,973
in order
to cool myself down again.

368
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:15,944
But that does not mean
the compulsion does not remain.

369
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,607
- So speaks a true artist!
- This is a real confession.

370
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:21,446
Magnificent!
What courage! What clarity!

371
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,680
I suggest we raise
our glasses to our artist --

372
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,847
not only a genius
but a thinker, too!

373
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,084
I'll be damned.
I never would have suspected.

374
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,026
A flowering rose
for your hair.

375
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,892
I must have scratched your cheek
with my fingernail.

376
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,956
Let me see.
I think it's bleeding!

377
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:40,470
My handkerchief...
No, it is clean.

378
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:44,872
- Our artist is wounded.
- I'm so clumsy.

379
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,608
Stay calm now.
You've had too much to drink.

380
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,410
Come, stay by me
for a little while now.

381
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,316
He doesn't sleep at night.
That's why he can handle so little.

382
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,684
Come, let's you and I
get some fresh air.

383
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:04,926
The core of the castle dates
from the 14th century.

384
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,725
It's been in our family
since the late 16th century.

385
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,666
We got a little over-excited.
We live in such isolation.

386
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:14,795
We gave you a scare,
but you won't leave us now, will you?

387
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,069
See there, Corinne,
our castle is rather beautiful at night.

388
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,337
Yes, and that would be
only at night.

389
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:25,012
My garter!
Look away now, Mr. Heerbrand!

390
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,573
- Where has Ernst gone?
- Ernst, friend, where are you?

391
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,642
I just went off on my own a bit.

392
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,689
I'm ashamed
that the grounds are so unkempt.

393
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,953
Imagine ten years ago --
a paragon of garden art.

394
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,859
We never kiss.
Have you thought of that?

395
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,329
I can almost count our kisses.

396
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:45,562
There is something
that frightens me almost to insanity.

397
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,831
I meet an unknown man
in the road.

398
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,499
We converse.

399
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:54,670
Suddenly he turns and lands
a vicious blow on my cheek!

400
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:58,875
His face is corpse white
and his eyes are full of hatred.

401
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,280
And I understand nothing!

402
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,649
I only feel nauseated.
My nose is bleeding,

403
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,850
I stammer some silly excuses,
horribly shaken,

404
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,916
and I ask myself,
when the man has disappeared,

405
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,929
"Is this how it is?
Is this how it must be?"

406
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:16,455
I can never forget
the man's eyes.

407
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,094
- The worst thing was...
- Nothing to worry about.

408
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:21,603
...the blow, that blow...

409
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:25,164
The worst of all was
the man's eyes...

410
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,700
Are you leaving already?

411
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,905
No, before you leave
you must see

412
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,471
where I've hung your painting
of Veronica Vogler.

413
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,381
Alma, dear, come along, too.

414
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,510
She's sleeping.
We won't disturb her.

415
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:40,023
- I'm not sleeping.
- Of course we'll go along.

416
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,287
Come, then, both of you.
Won't take a moment.

417
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,759
Alma, you are about to see

418
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,320
something very beautiful
your husband has made.

419
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,697
Here is the painting,

420
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,759
directly in front of my bed.

421
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,396
I can see it
each morning and night.

422
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,932
It has become like a part
of my solitary life.

423
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,171
I love her.

424
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,883
How long did you live together?

425
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:13,389
Pardon my asking
something so personal.

426
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:16,051
- Five years.
- Really?

427
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,855
So he's told you?

428
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,522
He loved her, didn't he?

429
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:23,090
I didn't need to ask that.

430
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:27,126
It was a first-class scandal
at the time.

431
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,365
But so romantic...

432
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,370
- Jealous?
- I don't believe so.

433
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:38,040
My husband is quite jealous.
Well, he's an excellent lover.

434
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,311
Look at this mark, by the way.

435
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:45,952
It's a scar from another man's,
shall we say, advances?

436
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,685
A never-ending spring
of renewed desire.

437
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:55,295
It's all very trivial, of course,
but it's stimulating for me.

438
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,357
I need to come up with
something new soon.

439
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,699
That mark can't evoke
fascinated admiration forever.

440
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,568
Can you help me?

441
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,938
Alma, little dear,
don't get angry.

442
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:09,378
It was only in jest, of course,
but it was a stupid joke.

443
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,607
Come, let's go
down to the others.

444
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:20,948
I have, in any case, bought
a considerable piece of your husband...

445
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,949
...have I not?

446
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,310
I have to confess
that I have read your diary.

447
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:51,013
It makes me sick with fear!

448
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,386
Wait. Hear me out.

449
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,392
I need to tell you what I've been
thinking these past few days.

450
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,291
Here's what I've been thinking.

451
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,388
I see that something
is going to happen, something evil,

452
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,434
but I don't know what to call it.

453
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,334
But if you think
I'm going to run away, I won't!

454
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:10,805
I won't run away
no matter how frightened I am!

455
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,207
And one more thing.

456
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:17,873
They're trying to separate us.
They want you for themselves.

457
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:20,610
As long as I'm with you,
it's much harder for them.

458
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,784
I won't run away,
no matter how much they try!

459
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,326
I'll stay right where I am!

460
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,693
Johan, answer me!

461
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:13,189
- Do you hear how quiet it is?
- Yes, it is quiet.

462
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:22,134
There was a time
when nights were for sleep...

463
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,438
...deep, dreamless sleep.

464
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:29,140
I cannot sleep.

465
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,104
I wake out of fear.

466
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:42,222
- Are you tired?
- No, not so terribly.

467
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:45,625
I have held vigil each night
until daylight.

468
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:50,756
But this is the worst hour.

469
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,602
- Do you know what it's called?
- No.

470
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,869
The old people used to call it
the "Hour of the Wolf."

471
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:04,003
It's the hour
at which most people die

472
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,072
and most children are born.

473
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,977
It's now that the nightmares
come to us.

474
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:13,654
- And if we are awake...
- We are afraid.

475
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,225
We are afraid.

476
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,696
What is it?

477
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,667
Nothing. I just thought
of something from my childhood.

478
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:33,006
It was some sort of punishment.

479
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,005
They threw me into a closet.

480
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,338
They shut the door.

481
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,073
It got quiet and dark.

482
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:44,013
I was horribly scared.

483
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,214
I kicked and pounded,

484
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:51,057
because they had told me
that a little person lived in that closet...

485
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:57,032
...who gnawed the toes
off naughty children!

486
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:03,404
When I stopped pounding,
I heard something rattling,

487
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:06,340
and I knew my hour had come.

488
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,506
And in a kind of... silent panic,

489
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,209
I climbed onto some shelves

490
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,344
and tried to heave myself
up by my hands.

491
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,480
Clothes tumbled around me.

492
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:21,888
I lost my grip and fell.

493
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,223
I swung my fists through the air

494
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,388
to shield myself
from that little creature.

495
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:31,594
All the while I wailed in fear

496
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,659
and begged to be forgiven.

497
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:39,875
Finally the door opened and they
let me step out into the daylight.

498
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,338
My father said,

499
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,281
"Mother tells me you're sorry."

500
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:52,044
I said,
"Yes, please forgive me."

501
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:56,487
"Prepare the divan, then,"
he said.

502
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:00,396
I went to the green divan
in my father's room,

503
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:05,902
took some cushions,
and stacked them.

504
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,440
Then I fetched the cane,
unbuttoned my trousers,

505
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,907
and leaned forward
onto the cushions.

506
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:19,748
He said, "So how many strokes
do you deserve?"

507
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,787
And I answered,
"As many strokes as possible."

508
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,722
And he struck me with the cane,

509
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,692
hard enough

510
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,752
but not more
than I could bear.

511
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,591
When the caning was over,

512
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:42,331
I went to Mother and asked,

513
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,533
"Mother, can you
forgive me now?"

514
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:50,176
And she cried and said,
"Of course I forgive you."

515
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,208
Then she offered me her hand.

516
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,744
I kissed it.

517
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:11,934
Alma, are you listening?

518
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,401
Are you asleep?

519
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,165
No, I'm awake.

520
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,905
My back aches.

521
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,103
To think it's pitch black out still.

522
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,114
And so quiet...

523
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,818
Strange, how the sea is never still.

524
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:37,081
Frightening somehow.

525
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,494
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm not crying.

526
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:45,028
I'm thinking of the child

527
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,969
and this great, quiet darkness.

528
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:51,601
Maybe it will never
get light again.

529
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,533
Poor dear.

530
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,205
Give me your hand.

531
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,984
That's much better.

532
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:10,487
Remember that day
I said I'd been snakebitten?

533
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:12,759
Yes.

534
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,759
It wasn't a snakebite.

535
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:19,862
Not a snakebite?

536
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:26,138
I thought I'd never tell a soul.
I don't even know if...

537
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,168
You have to tell me!

538
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,770
You must never tell anyone else.

539
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:35,682
No, I promise,
I'll never tell anyone.

540
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:40,246
Remember that place by the cliffs?
We were there early this summer.

541
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,312
Yes.

542
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

543
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:08,100
Is the door locked securely?

544
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:10,042
I checked twice.

545
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,250
Good morning!

546
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:25,089
Forgive my intrusion.
A thousand pardons.

547
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:29,865
Looks like a storm coming!
I thought I'd stop in for a moment.

548
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,759
I do also have an errand.

549
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:37,063
May I sit down?
This won't take long.

550
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:43,237
I am to convey an invitation
from the castle.

551
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:47,477
We had thought a little party...
No, not a big gathering.

552
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:49,848
Just something
to distract those poor people

553
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,581
stuck in the castle year round,
gnawing on each other!

554
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:55,419
As I said, not a large party.

555
00:59:56,125 --> 01:00:00,824
But it will interest you
that Veronica Vogler will be there.

556
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:05,061
And you will come too, yes?

557
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,360
All right, then it's agreed.

558
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:12,305
Incidentally, von Merkens and I
discussed the other day

559
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,366
your possible need
to defend yourself.

560
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,504
I mean, from all
the small game on the island.

561
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:23,280
That is all for the moment.
Good morning, dear friends.

562
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,446
Hope to see you
at our little party.

563
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,994
Shouldn't you lock
that weapon away?

564
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:35,394
No, why?

565
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,693
And what do we do now?

566
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,007
You can tell me
about Veronica Vogler.

567
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,310
What do you want me to say?

568
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:55,578
That it went on for five years?

569
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,142
You know that already.

570
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,450
We were discovered.
It was a huge scandal.

571
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:02,958
The story was quieted down...
and then it ended.

572
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:05,961
That's not what it says
in your diary.

573
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:17,203
"My attachment to Veronica
finally was painful for us both.

574
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:21,505
"I followed her in the streets,
jealously spied on her.

575
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:24,375
"l believe my passion
stimulated her,

576
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:27,007
"but she was always passive
and indecisive.

577
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:30,610
"We often ended
in frightening confrontations

578
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,678
"far from any semblance
of reason.

579
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:37,158
We traveled from town to town
evading relatives or lawyers."

580
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,388
No!

581
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,393
"We incarnated the words
of the Bible,

582
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:50,132
that man and woman
shall be of one flesh."

583
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,841
"Then her husband came
and fetched her.

584
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,037
"I was sent to the hospital.

585
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:58,603
We did not see each other
for several years."

586
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:09,485
You said once
that what you liked about me

587
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:13,859
was that God had made me
in one piece...

588
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:21,759
...that I had whole feelings
and whole thoughts.

589
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,833
You said it was important
that there were people like me.

590
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:33,177
It sounded so lovely.

591
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,575
It made me so happy.

592
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,518
I was wrong.

593
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,753
I don't understand a thing.

594
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,925
I don't understand you!

595
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,793
You're nothing but frightened!

596
01:02:56,539 --> 01:03:00,942
And you want to stay here
and possibly be killed!

597
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,744
Do you think I want to see you
run after that woman,

598
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:08,784
talking to those ghosts,
guarding myself all the time?

599
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,648
Do you think I want that?

600
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:15,079
But I'll stay.

601
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:05,499
Get up from the table now.

602
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,546
Now walk towards the door.

603
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:22,918
Now walk through it.

604
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:25,489
You go down the steps.

605
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,961
It's not dark anymore.
You can find your way.

606
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:59,554
How delightful!
Welcome!

607
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:03,224
Carry the tray, please.

608
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:06,700
Thank you.
It's my supper, you see.

609
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:10,963
Old Lindhorst, who is worldly,
says that old harlots

610
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:15,204
have an unhealthy desire
to fill their mouths and stomachs.

611
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:19,037
You really don't care for anything?

612
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:21,106
Wasn't there to be
a party here this evening?

613
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:23,413
Not as far as I know.

614
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:28,687
No, don't leave!

615
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,558
Please help me off
with my stockings.

616
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:38,663
You don't like to touch me.

617
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,532
I sense it clearly.

618
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,071
I don't understand.

619
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:48,135
Veronica Vogler has come...

620
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:52,643
...and I'm the only one
who can tell you where she is.

621
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:57,819
Look closely at my feet, Artist.

622
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:02,215
Have you seen younger,
tighter arches?

623
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,782
Look closely.
Look at my heel,

624
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,488
how smooth and fine it is.

625
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:11,829
Such strong toes
and beautiful nails.

626
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:13,596
Kiss my foot.

627
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:15,830
Yes, go ahead.

628
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:18,437
Yes, there!

629
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,467
You've been sweet,

630
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:25,105
and I'll tell you where she is.

631
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:31,450
Try the west gallery.

632
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,978
She was there five minutes ago.

633
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:12,958
- Pardon me, I thought --
- You're always welcome, dear friend.

634
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:16,590
You come, you go, you stay.
You have complete freedom.

635
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,958
Let us speak openly as well.

636
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,368
You have come
to find Veronica Vogler.

637
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:25,597
I should perhaps mention
before you see her

638
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:28,905
that Veronica has been
my mistress for several years.

639
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:34,182
She has kindly related in detail
your common past.

640
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,477
I can assure you I suffer.

641
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,979
I shall be by your bed tonight.

642
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:44,786
Every word, every kiss,
every movement across your bodies...

643
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:47,192
Nothing will be spared me.

644
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,860
Come, I'll show the way.

645
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,269
Oh, it's only my jealousy.
Please go away.

646
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:40,247
Yes, of course.
Of course.

647
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:36,803
It's Conductor Kreisler playing.

648
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:44,304
Conductor Kreisler
is a master at his instrument.

649
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:52,547
Don't you think Veronica
has waited long enough?

650
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:56,421
She began preparing
for your visit already this morning.

651
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:00,619
She has become
even more beautiful.

652
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:03,655
My husband is suffering.

653
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:05,495
He is jealous.

654
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:10,167
And your touching
little companion...

655
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:13,703
Three shots,
one of them fatal.

656
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,544
Wonderful music.

657
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:24,379
I think I must take off my hat
so I can hear better.

658
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,203
It really smells of glue!

659
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:49,335
Though she insists
it is all synthetic.

660
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:52,972
Plain old glue is what it is.
She can't fool me.

661
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:20,633
We have our tricks, don't we?

662
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:23,803
Let's see now
if we're presentable.

663
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:27,542
How pale you are, dear friend.
What a sight!

664
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,948
Your lips are as blue
as if you'd eaten blueberries.

665
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:32,044
We must do something.
Sit down here.

666
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:37,014
Let's see what we can do.

667
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,352
Right.

668
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:44,362
A lovely cupid's bow...

669
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:50,665
A sensual lower lip
is always titillating.

670
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:53,898
Your eyes are swollen
and bloodshot.

671
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:56,376
This will soothe them.

672
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:06,017
Well, dear me.

673
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:11,285
And so, a few lines
on the eyelids.

674
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:14,028
There now!

675
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,167
Some fresh color to your skin
wouldn't hurt.

676
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:32,711
Well, what next?
Yes, borrow my robe.

677
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:40,452
There and there...
and there.

678
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,719
And see there.
It suits you, it suits you!

679
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:48,496
Wait, beautiful pajamas are called for
on occasions such as this.

680
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,800
A nice perfume? No?

681
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,337
You prefer to smell
of yourself, of course.

682
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:58,805
Each to his own scent,
but a little...

683
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,398
...gives a scent anyway.

684
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:02,444
I knew it.

685
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:04,502
See yourself now in the mirror.

686
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,848
Now you are yourself

687
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:12,182
and yet not yourself,

688
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:15,917
the ideal state
for a meeting between lovers.

689
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:19,591
Come now!
This way!

690
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,842
There is her door.

691
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,260
You see what you want to see!

692
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:45,261
Veronica, no!

693
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:12,387
No, them...
Don't pay attention to them!

694
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:18,350
I thank you...

695
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:23,890
...that the limit
has finally been transgressed.

696
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:28,159
The mirror has been shattered.

697
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,965
But what do the splinters reflect?

698
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:37,739
Can you tell me that?

699
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:31,021
Yes, he fired three shots.

700
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:35,703
One scratched my arm.
I still have a little scar.

701
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:39,833
I fell over from sheer terror.

702
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:42,308
I thought it best to lie still.

703
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:47,181
I heard him pace back and forth,
behind and around the house...

704
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:50,474
...then he ran toward the path.

705
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:52,883
I stood up, went inside,

706
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:55,855
washed off the blood,
and put on a bandage.

707
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:59,218
Then I hid the pistol
and sat down to wait.

708
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:05,663
He was gone some minutes,
then he came running back.

709
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:09,494
I hid myself
to be on the safe side.

710
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:12,297
He looked absolutely insane.

711
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:16,566
He walked around the cottage
talking to himself...

712
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:21,147
...then he got out the diary
and began to write.

713
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:23,717
He wrote for hours.

714
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,517
Then by mid-morning
he packed his satchel

715
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,820
and headed off
toward the woods.

716
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,458
I thought it best to follow him.

717
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:36,791
He might harm himself.

718
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,837
Don't you see me?

719
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:36,350
- Where is he?
- I know where you can find him.

720
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:37,476
Come.

721
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,648
Call to him, then.

722
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:14,073
Well, there is one thing
I've wondered.

723
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:16,935
Are you in a hurry?

724
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:19,377
I'd like to ask you something.

725
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:21,780
It's like this.

726
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:28,081
Isn't it true that when a woman
has lived a long time with a man...

727
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:32,151
...isn't it true
she finally becomes like that man?

728
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:36,020
Since she loves him

729
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:38,327
and tries to think like him

730
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:40,162
and see like him.

731
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:43,493
They say
that it can change a person.

732
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:49,800
Was that why
I began to see those ghosts?

733
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:53,370
Or were they there anyway?

734
01:25:56,417 --> 01:26:00,410
I mean, if I'd loved him less

735
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:03,787
and not bothered
about everything there around him...

736
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:07,459
...could I have
protected him better then?

737
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:15,298
Or was it
that I didn't love him enough

738
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:17,702
that made me so jealous?

739
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:24,642
Was that why those "cannibals,"
as he called them...

740
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:29,011
...was that why
we came to such grief?

741
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:39,719
I thought I was so close to him.

742
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:45,794
Sometimes he said
he was also close to me.

743
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:50,464
One time he said it
with certainty.

744
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:57,906
If only I could have
followed him, all the time.

745
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:04,011
There's so much
to keep pondering...

746
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:09,846
...so many questions, sometimes
I don't know which way is which,

747
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:11,949
and I get completely...
