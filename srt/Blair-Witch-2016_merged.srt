616
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,708
It's old. It's good in low light.

- It's better than modern cameras.
- LISA: Okay.

618
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:01,998
Does it use tapes?

619
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:04,088
Like the one you found? Or is it...

620
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:06,593
You know, there's not too many brands
of them anymore. Why?

Oh, nothing, I... Just curious.

Everything is cards now,

but in some ways, you know tapes are
more reliable and cheaper.

Is there anything that you two told us
that is not a lie?

689
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,936
And I guess it's just a coincidence
that your camera uses

690
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,936
the exact same kind of tape
that you found?

all the footage you need.

you'll hit the fence.
