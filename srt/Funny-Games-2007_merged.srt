1
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:27,596
Björling.

2
00:01:29,238 --> 00:01:30,737
Suliotis?

3
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:32,238
Close.

4
00:01:32,238 --> 00:01:33,862
Björling is easy.

5
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:42,497
Tebaldi.

6
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:45,226
- You win.
 - My turn.

7
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:59,297
- No looking.
 - I'm not.

8
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:01,871
Did Daddy look?

9
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,563
No.

10
00:02:04,737 --> 00:02:06,032
You sure?

11
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:09,031
- Yes.
 - Okay.

12
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:21,293
Oh, God.

13
00:02:22,904 --> 00:02:24,232
Gigli?

14
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:27,094
Of course, but what?

15
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:48,797
Well? Darling?

16
00:02:55,604 --> 00:02:57,762
I'd say Handel.

17
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,564
Right. But what is it?

18
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:03,925
Not a clue.

19
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:13,270
- Well?
 - I give up. What is it?

20
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,428
Three-two to me.

21
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:24,525
Hey, hands off.
 Hey, no. Just... Just listen.

22
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

23
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,933
Hey! That's not fair.

24
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,496
What?

25
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:57,032
Practicing's not fair.

26
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:00,568
You're still on for 10 tomorrow, right?

27
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,057
You're still coming?

28
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,199
Uh, yeah, sure.

29
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:16,237
We have to launch the boat.

30
00:05:16,237 --> 00:05:19,270
Can you give us a hand,
 in about 20 minutes?

31
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,429
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'll be there.
 I'll come over in 20 minutes.

32
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,303
Okay, great. See you then.

33
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:28,131
Bye!

34
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,903
What was up with him?

35
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,562
Don't know.

36
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:42,997
Seems weird.

37
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:46,891
She didn't say a word.

38
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:50,803
Who did you talk to
 about the game tomorrow?

39
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:52,270
With her.

40
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,936
- When?
 - Day before yesterday.

41
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:59,736
- And?
 - Nothing, she was fine.

42
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:01,237
Where's Jenny?

43
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:05,396
I don't know, sweetheart.
 Maybe she's at the beach or inside.

44
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:10,870
- Who were those guys?
 - Don't know.

45
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,733
Maybe relatives.
 Doesn't her brother have a son that age?

46
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:55,303
Don't put that there.
 Take your stuff upstairs, please.

47
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:56,603
Yeah.

48
00:06:56,603 --> 00:06:59,536
Keep the doorway clear
 or someone's gonna trip.

49
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:02,024
We have a lot more in the car.

50
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:05,770
Hey, are you listening to me?

51
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,770
I'm going, already.

52
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,203
Open the windows, please.
 We need to let some air in.

53
00:07:11,203 --> 00:07:13,100
Yeah, Mom.

54
00:07:20,237 --> 00:07:23,690
Get out, Lucky. Out.

55
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:27,693
Come on, get down.

56
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:31,696
Come on.

57
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:36,303
- George?
 - Yeah?

58
00:07:36,303 --> 00:07:38,403
Where are the other groceries?

59
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:40,303
I'll get it.

60
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:43,029
Golf clubs were in the way.

61
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,099
Hurry up, everything's getting warm.

62
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,767
This cooler's a piece of shit.

63
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,070
Stop it, buddy.

64
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,269
You'll knock me over.

65
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,736
Go to Mommy, go on, go to Mommy.
 She'll give you a treat.

66
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:03,503
The meat's in the other box.
 Will you grab it for me?

67
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:05,103
I'm just opening the windows.

68
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:08,403
Leave the shutters in the front,
 it'll get too hot.

69
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:10,770
Lucky, come on. Honey, get out.

70
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,603
Will you...? Come on,
 I'll get you something in a minute.

71
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:17,536
Lucky, please.
 Will you call the dog, honey?

72
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:19,037
Lucky, get out of here.

73
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:20,603
- Call the dog.
 - Lucky.

74
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:21,903
Go on, honey.

75
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:23,925
Come here, come to Daddy.

76
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:33,533
Stop it, Lucky. Be quiet.

77
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:36,436
I'm sorry. He's...

78
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:39,196
He's nuts. Come in.

79
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,269
Hey there, Fred. Good to see you.

80
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:45,803
Thanks for helping.
 It'd be pretty hard on my own.

81
00:08:45,803 --> 00:08:48,636
No problem. This is Paul.

82
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:50,436
- Pleasure to meet you.
 - Pleasure.

83
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:53,731
Paul's father
 is a business associate of mine.

84
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:56,136
Thanks for helping.

85
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:59,936
No, the pleasure's all mine.
 Not so much his.

86
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:01,803
- Lucky, come on.
 - Sorry, he's crazy.

87
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:03,136
Stop it!

88
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:06,870
- Hey! Come over here!
 - Thank you, honey.

89
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,536
So when did you get here?

90
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:10,503
- Last week.
 - You too?

91
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:11,903
- No.
 - Yes.

92
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:15,703
Well, they didn't get here till
 the weekend. We got here on Friday.

93
00:09:15,703 --> 00:09:19,503
Hi, Fred. Thanks for coming right over.

94
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:21,770
It's good to see you. How's Eve?

95
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,536
Fine.

96
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:26,024
- Hello.
 - Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

97
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:29,003
- And where are the Keys?
 - Got it?

98
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,229
On the southern coast of Florida.

99
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,936
- Isn't it hotter down there?
 - No.

100
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:35,102
Push.

101
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:36,431
It ain't all the time.

102
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:42,233
Last year when I was in Miami
 it rained cats and dogs the whole time.

103
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:47,369
And you were up here and you were
 swimming every day, remember?

104
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:51,136
Still, it sucks that Jenny isn't here.
 It's boring without...

105
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:52,536
Careful.

106
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:54,736
I am being careful.

107
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:57,223
That was an expensive overhaul.

108
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,636
See? Not a single scratch.

109
00:10:05,636 --> 00:10:08,692
Well, now you can help me
 put up the boom.

110
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,898
You got it?

111
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:14,261
Yeah.

112
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,291
- Put it down over there.
 - Okay.

113
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:24,503
But she told me
 she'd be here the whole time.

114
00:10:24,503 --> 00:10:29,799
Yeah, well, I don't know either.
 I don't know why she told you that.

115
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:33,569
Maybe she went out with a friend.

116
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:36,403
We'll ask her mother tomorrow
 when we see her.

117
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:40,503
Anyway,
 forecast for tomorrow is wind.

118
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:42,933
Why was Uncle Fred
 behaving so strangely?

119
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:44,770
Well, I'm not surprised.

120
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,496
She got pretty worked up about it
 last time.

121
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:54,993
Come on, just forget about it.
 She's not gonna change.

122
00:10:56,136 --> 00:10:59,369
Yeah, well,
 you're only gonna upset yourself.

123
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:02,391
Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

124
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:07,397
Oh, they're great.
 They're outside playing on the boat.

125
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:09,569
Uh...

126
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,569
I don't know, 5, 5:30.

127
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:16,000
My kitchen clock's not working,
 so I have to get that fixed on Monday.

128
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:23,002
Yeah, exactly,
 that's what I'm doing right now.

129
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:25,069
We're having steak.

130
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:29,202
It all defrosted,
 so now I have to get rid of it.

131
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:31,099
You should come on out.

132
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:35,036
Yeah, that was stupid of me.

133
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:36,636
I froze 4 pounds of steak...

134
00:11:36,636 --> 00:11:40,636
...now I'm standing here
 looking at half a cow.

135
00:11:40,636 --> 00:11:45,260
I'm not joking. Come on out, please,
 just for the weekend.

136
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:50,735
Well, tell him not to be so difficult.

137
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:52,202
Hold on a second.

138
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:54,802
- What is it, honey?
 - We need a sharp knife.

139
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:56,392
Okay.

140
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:01,236
- I'd like to see it again.
 - Okay.

141
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:03,769
- Tell your father.
 - Okay.

142
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:06,291
So, what do you think?

143
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:10,869
Well, tell your sweetheart
 to bring his laptop with him.

144
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:13,629
Jump in the car,
 and you'll be here in an hour.

145
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:18,725
Well, he shouldn't be so antisocial.

146
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:24,269
Come on, we've got enough steak
 for the whole week.

147
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:26,869
What is it? Hold on. Okay.

148
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:30,635
All right. Well, listen, just call me
 and let me know, all right?

149
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:32,602
Okay, all right, Nancy.

150
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:34,124
- Bye.
 - Bye.

151
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:37,002
What now, honey?

152
00:12:37,002 --> 00:12:40,503
- There's someone here.
 - Where?

153
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:42,434
At the door.

154
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:47,902
- Hello.
 - Hello.

155
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:52,436
Sorry to disturb you, I'm staying
 next door. I saw you earlier at the gate.

156
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:54,559
Oh, yeah, of course.

157
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:57,590
Please, come in.

158
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:05,202
So how can I help you?

159
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,302
Tell your dad we're eating
 in 10 minutes.

160
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:08,568
Okay.

161
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:10,102
Well, Eve s...

162
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:12,403
I mean, Mrs. Thompson sent me.

163
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:16,493
She's cooking and she ran out of eggs
 and asked if you could help her out.

164
00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:19,869
Of course. How many does she need?

165
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:21,027
Four.

166
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:22,624
Four?

167
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,502
What for?

168
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:26,435
- Excuse me?
 - What for?

169
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:31,769
What does she need the eggs for?
 I mean, what's she cooking?

170
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,132
I have no idea.

171
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:40,568
So are they okay just like this
 or do you need the carton?

172
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:42,533
Whatever you want.

173
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:45,202
How did you get in here?

174
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:47,002
Down there.

175
00:13:47,002 --> 00:13:49,568
I mean, down by the water.

176
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:51,568
But you're not wet.

177
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:55,302
There's a hole in the fence.
 By the water, not in the water.

178
00:13:55,302 --> 00:14:00,036
Fred sh... I mean, Mr. Thompson,
 knows about it. He showed it to me.

179
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:02,557
Oh, I see.

180
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:05,236
So you sure they're okay like this?

181
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:07,435
Yeah, yeah. That's okay. No problem.

182
00:14:07,435 --> 00:14:09,702
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
 - All right.

183
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:13,236
Say hello to Eve. Tell her we're
 looking forward to the game tomorrow.

184
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:14,635
I'll tell her. Thanks again.

185
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:16,568
Thanks to Fred and your friend for help...

186
00:14:16,568 --> 00:14:18,999
- Shit.
 - What happened?

187
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:28,929
It's not a disaster.

188
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:48,897
We have to go grocery shopping
 on Monday anyway.

189
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:57,092
I'm really sorry.

190
00:14:57,735 --> 00:15:02,099
It's not so bad. None of us eat eggs
 for breakfast anyway.

191
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:07,802
So the disaster's under control.

192
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:11,102
Well, thank you. I'm sorry,
 I should have paid more attention.

193
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:13,969
Well, you shouldn't cry
 over spilt milk, right?

194
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:14,991
You're really nice.

195
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:17,725
You do what you can.

196
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:23,056
I really am sorry.

197
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:30,235
I'm very clumsy, you know?
 I think I have two left hands.

198
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:34,368
- Then you're the man for carrying eggs.
 - Yes, you could say that.

199
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:38,061
So, what are we going to do now?

200
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:44,802
Well, we have a lot of steak,
 but we might be expecting guests...

201
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:47,902
...and they definitely eat eggs
 for breakfast.

202
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:49,869
You'll still have four left.

203
00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:52,635
It's a box with a dozen, isn't it?
 Or am I mistaken?

204
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:55,361
No, you're not mistaken.

205
00:16:04,201 --> 00:16:06,902
So would you like the carton this time?

206
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:09,869
- It's not necessary.
 - Are you sure?

207
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,135
But if you insist.

208
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:13,402
If I insist?

209
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:16,799
Well, it might be better, I guess.

210
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:26,035
- Oh, God.
 - What?

211
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,301
Oh, no.

212
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:29,198
I'm sorry.

213
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:38,602
Before you destroy
 the rest of the kitchen...

214
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:41,101
...maybe you should take the eggs
 and leave. All right?

215
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,760
Yes.

216
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:50,560
No carton?

217
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,635
I'm really sorry. Honestly.

218
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,361
Me too.

219
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:06,735
Here you go.

220
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,001
Thank you very much. Thank you.

221
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:11,301
I'll tell Mrs. Thompson
 how nice you were.

222
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:12,802
Do what you have to do.

223
00:17:12,802 --> 00:17:14,767
Have a nice day.

224
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:25,597
Excuse me?

225
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:32,101
Lucky. Lucky. Get down.
 Come on, come on, stop that.

226
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:34,759
Get out of here. Go on, get lost.

227
00:18:36,068 --> 00:18:39,502
I'm sorry. He's completely harmless.
 He just wants to play.

228
00:18:39,502 --> 00:18:41,801
That's a strange way to play.

229
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:44,868
- Did he hurt you?
 - Peter is afraid of dogs.

230
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:46,801
Oh, I'm sorry.

231
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:49,068
Me too. He jumped on me.

232
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:51,801
- I'm really sorry.
 - Yeah.

233
00:18:51,801 --> 00:18:55,368
- Should I lock him up so you can leave?
 - That won't be necessary.

234
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,068
- I can call my husband.
 - It's not gonna be necessary.

235
00:18:58,068 --> 00:19:01,301
It's my fault.
 I completely forgot about the dog.

236
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:03,697
I should've come myself and...

237
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,562
Wow.

238
00:19:07,268 --> 00:19:10,028
That's a really great set of clubs.

239
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:13,496
It's Callaway, right?

240
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,089
Awesome.

241
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:20,397
These are wonderful. May I?

242
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:26,895
I guess we don't
 stand a chance tomorrow, do we?

243
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:33,198
The club doesn't make the player.

244
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:37,035
That's true.

245
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:39,567
Would you mind if I tried this?

246
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,402
Just once, please? Real quick.

247
00:19:42,402 --> 00:19:44,934
Outside. Please? Yes?

248
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,694
I'll hit it towards the bay. Yes?

249
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:51,868
If it makes you happy.

250
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:53,356
Thank you.

251
00:19:58,368 --> 00:20:00,801
Thanks a lot. Really.

252
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:02,734
Thank you.

253
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,359
Excuse me.

254
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:11,701
He loves golf. We both do.

255
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:15,292
- Excuse me?
 - We both do. We both love golf.

256
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:21,925
Lucky!

257
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:29,291
Lucky. Be quiet.

258
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,901
- What's the matter with him?
 - I don't know.

259
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:41,593
It's probably too hot for him too.

260
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:05,929
I'll take a look.

261
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:34,068
It's wonderful. It really
 makes a difference, like night and day.

262
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:36,090
Thanks a lot.

263
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:38,265
Sure.

264
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:40,200
Lucky!

265
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,068
- Where's Tom?
 - Who?

266
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:44,033
Did you give him the eggs?

267
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:46,595
Excuse me?

268
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:54,267
Driver's really first class.
 You have to try it.

269
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:57,634
Listen, young man, I don't know
 what kind of game you're playing...

270
00:21:57,634 --> 00:21:59,895
...but I don't wanna be a part of it.

271
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:08,727
Would you please leave now?

272
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:15,362
What game?

273
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:20,734
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I don't understand
 why you're suddenly being so unfriendly.

274
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:24,756
- Did Tom or I do anything to upset you?
 - Please leave.

275
00:22:26,634 --> 00:22:29,497
Did you misbehave while I was outside?
 Was he rude?

276
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:32,764
- Did he say something that...?
 - Stop it.

277
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:42,731
I've asked you nicely to leave.
 Now I'd like you to go.

278
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:45,559
Well...

279
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:51,067
I don't understand what's upset you,
 but if you insist.

280
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:54,726
Just give Tom the eggs,
 and we won't bother you anymore.

281
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:56,868
Excuse me?

282
00:22:56,868 --> 00:23:01,134
We'll have to tell Eve and Fred. Nothing
 like this has happened to me before.

283
00:23:01,134 --> 00:23:03,031
What about you?

284
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:08,900
- Can you just give us the eggs, please?
 - No.

285
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,763
How dare you.

286
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:14,501
Please just go. Right now.

287
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:16,701
Did I do something wrong?

288
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:19,000
I asked you to leave. I want you to go.

289
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,734
Have you seen the dog? Is he with you?

290
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,801
- Will you throw them out?
 - It's good you're here, Mr. Farber.

291
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:27,234
- That's your name, isn't it? Farber?
 - Yes.

292
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:30,034
Yeah, Fre... Mr. Thompson told us.

293
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,100
- What's going on?
 - I want them to leave.

294
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,267
Your wife's under the wrong impression.
 I'm happy you're here.

295
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:37,933
I'm certain you can
 figure out this misunderstanding.

296
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:41,134
- George, please.
 - Dad, I can't...

297
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:43,134
Just go. Please, go.

298
00:23:43,134 --> 00:23:45,258
Hey, Ann.

299
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,800
This is ridiculous. I can't believe this.

300
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,200
- Honey, do you mind?
 - No, he's fine.

301
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,734
- May I please explain what happened?
 - Please do.

302
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:57,200
Mrs. Thompson sent me over
 to ask for some eggs, and then...

303
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,367
Your wife gave Peter the eggs,
 but, unfortunately, they broke.

304
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,501
And then she gave me
 another four eggs...

305
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:04,988
...but the dog jumped on me,
 and now...

306
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,933
You had a dozen and you're going
 shopping on Monday anyway.

307
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:11,733
We just want the eggs, that's all.

308
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:14,494
Ann, can you tell me
 what's going on here?

309
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,425
Honey, can you just tell
 me what's going on?

310
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,900
Just give them to them.

311
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,700
- Can I have them now?
 - Hold on a moment.

312
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,800
Ann, if it's just about some eggs,
 why are you so angry?

313
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,534
Look, I'm not going
 to justify myself in front...

314
00:24:33,534 --> 00:24:37,760
I asked you to throw them out.
 Maybe I have my reasons.

315
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,601
Do what you want. I've had enough.

316
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:45,190
Ann.

317
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:50,894
I'm sorry.

318
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:54,034
My wife's not feeling well, so...

319
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,692
Yeah.

320
00:24:56,267 --> 00:24:58,232
Could you please leave?

321
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,067
I can hardly play the mediator
 if I don't know the facts, now, can I?

322
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:07,055
So could you just leave, please?

323
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:13,993
Please, the...

324
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,188
- What?
 - Just give them to him.

325
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:21,800
- What the hell is going on here?
 - Nothing's going on, sir.

326
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,100
He asked for the eggs,
 the dog attacked him, they broke.

327
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,300
Now he would like some more.
 What is so difficult to understand?

328
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,288
You better watch your tone,
 young man.

329
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:37,992
You better be careful, old man,
 or I'll break your eggs.

330
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:43,700
Now, please leave, right now.

331
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,131
- Mr. Farber?
 - What?

332
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:47,900
Dad!

333
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,592
Is it broken?

334
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:52,991
Hey, hey, come on, come on,
 come on.

335
00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:56,929
Hey. Come on. Behave yourself.

336
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,900
Behave yourself, okay?

337
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,388
Okay? I don't want to hurt you...

338
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:05,892
...so you have to behave yourself.

339
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,134
- Mom.
 - What is it, baby?

340
00:26:12,134 --> 00:26:14,395
Please, just, ma'am,
 stay where you are, okay?

341
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:17,055
Please, stay.

342
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,522
- He slapped me in the face.
 - Yeah, he started it.

343
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,798
You can help him,
 just don't do anything stupid. Help him.

344
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,700
- You should bring him a chair.
 - What happened?

345
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,000
It's my knee.

346
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,234
You should take off his pants.
 He should sit. Bring him a chair.

347
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:43,357
Go get him a chair, honey.

348
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:46,800
Be careful.

349
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,731
Peter is a... He's a medical student.
 He can help you with it.

350
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,129
Can you please take off your pants?

351
00:26:56,134 --> 00:26:58,900
If you don't let me see
 your wound, I can't help you.

352
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,267
I'm sorry I hurt you,
 but you forced me to, you must admit.

353
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:07,100
Come on, Mr. Farber,
 be reasonable. Let him look at your leg.

354
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,065
He can help you with it.

355
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,597
Would you please...

356
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,266
...leave?

357
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:18,900
Please.

358
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,262
We won't get anywhere like this.

359
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,034
You have to let him help you,
 you don't really have a choice.

360
00:27:29,034 --> 00:27:31,134
You're the ship's captain, sir.

361
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:36,497
You're aware that onboard,
 the captain's word is law, aren't you?

362
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,289
So, what do you want to do?

363
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:42,233
You want to call someone?

364
00:27:42,233 --> 00:27:45,221
An ambulance or the police?

365
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:47,733
I won't stop you.

366
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,630
Neither will Tom. Right, Tom?

367
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,556
Well, what are you waiting for?

368
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:03,354
He dropped the cell phone in the sink.

369
00:28:09,566 --> 00:28:13,020
- Why are you doing this?
 - Why not?

370
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,362
Okay, let's play another game.

371
00:28:17,366 --> 00:28:19,490
It's a guessing game.

372
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:24,998
What is this?

373
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,424
Sir?

374
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,628
It's a golf ball.

375
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:48,733
Correct. It's a golf ball.

376
00:28:48,733 --> 00:28:51,630
But why do I have it in my pocket?

377
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:55,566
Hm? The lady knows why.

378
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:57,121
Because?

379
00:29:00,366 --> 00:29:01,990
Well?

380
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:06,990
Well?

381
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:11,999
Because you didn't hit it.

382
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:16,021
Correct. Because I didn't hit it.
 And why didn't I hit it?

383
00:29:16,566 --> 00:29:19,533
Because something stopped you.

384
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:24,362
Correct. Because I had
 to test the club in another way.

385
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:36,057
Where is he?

386
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,095
Cold.

387
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:45,860
Even colder.

388
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,055
Cold.

389
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,690
Ice cold.

390
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:05,927
Warmer.

391
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:09,767
Warmer.

392
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,595
Little cold.

393
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:16,261
Warmer.

394
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,360
Warmer.

395
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,430
Warmer.

396
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,024
Cold.

397
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:31,692
Cold.

398
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,194
Warmer.

399
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:38,489
Warm, cold.

400
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:43,225
Warmer.

401
00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:45,754
Really warm.

402
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:09,128
Would you please go to the kitchen
 and get me something to eat?

403
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:12,021
That be possible?

404
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:27,292
Maybe there's some bananas or...

405
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:33,566
Please don't think about bringing back
 a knife or anything like that...

406
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:35,632
...or I'd be sorry.

407
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:37,893
For you, I mean.

408
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:48,257
It's getting cloudy.

409
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:56,099
That's very nice of you, thank you.

410
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:57,999
Hello?

411
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,725
Hello?

412
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:01,866
Hello?

413
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:03,922
Hello?

414
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:08,699
Yeah!

415
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:10,255
Hello!

416
00:32:10,866 --> 00:32:13,195
Hi, sweetie.

417
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,059
Where are you?

418
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:27,089
Come on down to the water.

419
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:33,087
We're both thinking the same thing,
 aren't we?

420
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:36,155
Hm?

421
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:46,123
We saw your boat.

422
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:48,766
Hi, Betsy.

423
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,754
Hi, Robert.

424
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:54,299
When did you get here?

425
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:55,923
Today.

426
00:32:56,532 --> 00:32:58,690
We're still unpacking.

427
00:32:59,632 --> 00:33:01,722
How long you staying?

428
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:05,632
Probably a week or two.
 We're not sure yet.

429
00:33:05,632 --> 00:33:09,120
Oh, wonderful. So nice to see you.

430
00:33:10,732 --> 00:33:13,561
- Let me help you.
 - Thank you.

431
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:17,299
- Have you ever met my sister-in-law?
 - No.

432
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,532
Pleased to meet you.

433
00:33:19,532 --> 00:33:22,399
Hello, nice to meet you too.

434
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,632
Hello. Hi, Robert.

435
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:26,563
- Hi, how are you?
 - Fine.

436
00:33:28,432 --> 00:33:32,298
This is Paul. He's staying
 with the Thompsons next door.

437
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:35,532
- Hi, pleased to meet you.
 - Hi, Paul. You cold?

438
00:33:35,532 --> 00:33:39,732
- Oh, no, I have... I have eczema.
 - Oh.

439
00:33:39,732 --> 00:33:42,899
You should go swimming,
 the water works wonders for that here.

440
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:44,921
Thank you, that's good advice.

441
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:47,565
- Hello, pleased to meet you.
 - Hello.

442
00:33:47,565 --> 00:33:48,621
How's George?

443
00:33:49,565 --> 00:33:51,432
Fine, thanks.

444
00:33:51,432 --> 00:33:52,932
Where is he?

445
00:33:52,932 --> 00:33:58,365
He pulled a muscle putting up the mast,
 so he's lying down, resting.

446
00:33:58,365 --> 00:34:01,999
So sorry to hear that. That's what
 happens when you try to do too much.

447
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:05,265
Robert, on the other hand,
 would never dream of launching a boat.

448
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:06,924
Right, Robert?

449
00:34:07,699 --> 00:34:10,699
Tell your hubby to get better,
 we're grilling every night.

450
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:11,999
I'll tell him.

451
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:15,866
I mean it, as soon as he's better,
 swing by. Robert's son is here.

452
00:34:15,866 --> 00:34:18,799
He brought his little girlfriend.
 He'd like her for sure.

453
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:21,766
All right. Well, listen,
 it's great to see you, darling.

454
00:34:21,766 --> 00:34:25,632
Listen, if the weather stays like this,
 you'll probably have to take
the car.

455
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:27,866
- It's supposed to be windy.
 - For tomorrow...

456
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:30,732
- Where's your dock?
 - Excuse me?

457
00:34:30,732 --> 00:34:32,732
Your dock?

458
00:34:32,732 --> 00:34:36,198
Oh, it's just around the peninsula,
 but on the other side.

459
00:34:36,198 --> 00:34:38,732
The old cottage, with the red dock?

460
00:34:38,732 --> 00:34:40,632
Right.

461
00:34:40,632 --> 00:34:42,066
It's very beautiful.

462
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:44,189
Well, thank you, we enjoy it.

463
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:48,689
Well, anyway, it's good to see you.
 All right, goodbye.

464
00:34:55,298 --> 00:34:58,265
So you're here all week?

465
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:00,399
Well, this week for sure.

466
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:01,899
Maybe we'll come by tonight.

467
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,065
Oh, do, you know we love seeing you.

468
00:35:04,065 --> 00:35:06,899
All right.
 We'll see how George is doing.

469
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:09,098
Yeah, see how he is.

470
00:35:09,098 --> 00:35:10,499
Bye-bye.

471
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:12,521
- Bye.
 - Bye.

472
00:35:14,932 --> 00:35:17,098
They'll be here in two hours...

473
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:19,866
...and then this little charade of yours
 will be over.

474
00:35:19,866 --> 00:35:21,699
Sorry, but that's not exactly true.

475
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:24,232
Didn't you ask your friends to call
 and confirm...

476
00:35:24,232 --> 00:35:26,198
...or did I misunderstand something?

477
00:35:26,198 --> 00:35:29,595
They'll come,
 even if they can't reach us.

478
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:32,232
Is lying allowed?

479
00:35:32,232 --> 00:35:35,720
Just a second.
 Wait, let me move this out of the way.

480
00:35:36,232 --> 00:35:40,630
Why don't you have a landline?
 Don't you find it convenient?

481
00:35:41,198 --> 00:35:43,766
Or is it
 that you aren't out here that much?

482
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,599
Please, have a seat.

483
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:49,998
You know you can be completely
 open with us. You'd feel better.

484
00:35:49,998 --> 00:35:52,395
We're being completely open with you.

485
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:55,257
Right there.

486
00:36:01,532 --> 00:36:03,365
You should put a pillow under him.

487
00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:06,766
You know, if you'd let Peter
 help you, it would hurt less.

488
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:09,599
I'm happy to help, really,
 I just don't want to impose.

489
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,393
Careful with...

490
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:16,755
That's a good idea, put it up.
 That should be more comfortable.

491
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,393
So there we are.

492
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:24,488
- You sure you don't wanna put a pillow...?
 - Could you please stop this?

493
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:28,223
You're asking?

494
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:30,232
What?

495
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:31,424
You said, "Please."

496
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,521
I'm very happy about this.

497
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:46,728
It's easier when things are polite.

498
00:36:48,365 --> 00:36:51,262
I'd like to apologize for before.

499
00:36:51,865 --> 00:36:56,599
But you have to admit, George,
 the slap in the face?

500
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:59,757
It really wasn't
 the most appropriate reaction.

501
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:07,988
I'm Paul.

502
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:11,931
This is Peter.

503
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:15,624
Come here, Tom. Where are
 your manners? Shake the man's hand.

504
00:37:20,265 --> 00:37:22,731
Here, take this for the pain.

505
00:37:22,731 --> 00:37:24,958
What's this now?
 What, are we shit to you?

506
00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:28,555
What, didn't we just agree that?

507
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:32,120
Jesus Christ!

508
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:44,226
It's okay. It's okay.

509
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,865
Stop it now,
 otherwise your mother will get hurt.

510
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,057
Stop it! Do you understand?
 Do you understand?!

511
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:55,253
Calm down.

512
00:37:56,898 --> 00:37:58,523
Calm down.

513
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:11,720
So much stress for politeness' sake.

514
00:38:26,798 --> 00:38:29,698
I mean, I was just trying to be friendly.

515
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:32,631
Improve relations.
 I thought we could keep this civilized.

516
00:38:32,631 --> 00:38:34,119
Why are you doing this?

517
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:40,729
Tubby, why are we doing this?

518
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:44,591
Go on, say it.

519
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,361
I don't know.

520
00:38:48,865 --> 00:38:51,126
The captain would like to know why.

521
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:53,620
Well?

522
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:56,998
It's difficult to talk about it.

523
00:38:56,998 --> 00:38:58,929
Don't be shy.

524
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:02,696
You know exactly how hard
 this is for me.

525
00:39:03,232 --> 00:39:05,098
Jesus, what a drama.

526
00:39:05,098 --> 00:39:09,531
His father divorced his mother when
 he was this big, for another woman...

527
00:39:09,531 --> 00:39:13,032
It's not true! He's lying.

528
00:39:13,032 --> 00:39:15,361
My mother got a divorce because...

529
00:39:16,065 --> 00:39:19,765
Because she wanted her
 little teddy bear all to herself.

530
00:39:19,765 --> 00:39:23,398
Which is why he's gay,
 and he's a criminal, got it?

531
00:39:23,398 --> 00:39:25,498
You're an asshole.

532
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:27,298
The truth is...

533
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:31,765
...he's white trash. He comes
 from a filthy, deprived family.

534
00:39:31,765 --> 00:39:34,198
Five siblings, all of them on drugs.

535
00:39:34,198 --> 00:39:36,198
His father is an alcoholic.

536
00:39:36,198 --> 00:39:40,289
His mother, well, I mean,
 you can imagine.

537
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:42,522
Truth is...

538
00:39:43,498 --> 00:39:45,054
...he's fucking her.

539
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:48,692
It's sad, but it's true.

540
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:53,121
Come on. Calm down now, Tubby.

541
00:39:54,065 --> 00:39:55,859
Stop it.

542
00:39:56,598 --> 00:39:59,032
You're disgusting.

543
00:39:59,032 --> 00:40:02,292
Can't you at least watch your language
 in front of my son?

544
00:40:02,931 --> 00:40:04,398
Oh, I'm...

545
00:40:04,398 --> 00:40:05,727
I'm sorry.

546
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:08,198
Of course.

547
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:11,220
What would you like to hear?
 What would make you happy?

548
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:15,498
None of what I said is true,
 you know that as well as I do.

549
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:17,360
You think he's white trash?

550
00:40:18,398 --> 00:40:20,989
Come on, he's a spoiled little brat.

551
00:40:21,898 --> 00:40:27,420
He's jaded and disgusted
 by the emptiness of existence.

552
00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:29,987
It's hard.

553
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:32,389
Really.

554
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:40,419
He liked that. Look, now he's smiling.

555
00:40:42,865 --> 00:40:44,386
Okay?

556
00:40:45,197 --> 00:40:48,560
You happy now,
 or you want another version?

557
00:40:58,731 --> 00:41:00,127
I'm hungry.

558
00:41:01,264 --> 00:41:03,092
Let's see what there is.

559
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:06,032
Truth is...

560
00:41:06,032 --> 00:41:07,931
...he's a drug addict.

561
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:10,418
That's where he's going to right now.

562
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:15,297
That's why he's so nervous.
 I'm also a drug addict.

563
00:41:15,297 --> 00:41:20,798
We rob rich families in their charming
 vacation homes to support our
habit.

564
00:41:20,798 --> 00:41:23,888
Stop this bullshit.

565
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:29,389
- I get it. Isn't that enough?
 - That's good.

566
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:34,727
Hey, Tubby, he's got it.
 He gets it.

567
00:41:36,698 --> 00:41:39,931
That's awesome, really.
 Really. Listen...

568
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:41,691
Peter, come here.

569
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:44,594
Listen, we're gonna
 make a bet now, okay?

570
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:47,355
Come on, hurry up.

571
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:50,931
- Sit down.
 - It's dark in here.

572
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:53,054
Come on, don't fall asleep.

573
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:56,722
Okay, we bet... What time is it?

574
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,089
Eight-forty.

575
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:03,919
that in, let's say, 12 hours...

576
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,698
...all three of you...

577
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:10,031
...are gonna be kaput.

578
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:11,621
Okay?

579
00:42:14,731 --> 00:42:16,431
What?

580
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:19,364
You bet that you'll be
 alive tomorrow at 9:00...

581
00:42:19,364 --> 00:42:22,386
...and we bet
 that you'll be dead, okay?

582
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:39,765
They don't wanna bet.

583
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:43,031
Well, it's not an option.
 There has to be a bet.

584
00:42:43,031 --> 00:42:46,231
I mean, what do you think?
 You think they stand a chance?

585
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:50,031
You're on their side, aren't you?
 Who are you betting on, hm?

586
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:52,897
But, wait, what kind of bet is this?
 If they're dead...

587
00:42:52,897 --> 00:42:56,885
...they can't live up to their side,
 and if they win, they can't live, either.

588
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:00,231
Yes, they'll lose either way,
 that's what I'm saying.

589
00:43:00,231 --> 00:43:02,594
Stop this nonsense.
 Are you trying to scare us?

590
00:43:05,431 --> 00:43:07,364
Haven't you done enough already?

591
00:43:07,364 --> 00:43:10,797
What do you want? You want money?
 Well, take it. I'll tell you what.

592
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,921
Take what you want, just get out.

593
00:43:13,531 --> 00:43:15,086
Okay?

594
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,722
Don't you think Fred and Eve are going
 to come over and see what's happening?

595
00:43:23,097 --> 00:43:26,085
And then they're gonna give us
 a thorough spanking, right?

596
00:43:30,797 --> 00:43:32,197
Okay.

597
00:43:32,197 --> 00:43:34,855
So the bet is on.

598
00:43:35,797 --> 00:43:38,024
Like they say on TV:

599
00:43:38,564 --> 00:43:40,051
Let's make a deal.

600
00:43:42,598 --> 00:43:44,755
So, what do you want to do now?

601
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:50,192
Would you be so kind as to go
 and make us something to eat?

602
00:43:51,364 --> 00:43:52,488
Tubby...

603
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,498
...I'm worried about you.
 Can you control yourself?

604
00:43:56,498 --> 00:43:59,498
You just finished stuffing your face
 with that meat.

605
00:43:59,498 --> 00:44:02,231
It's disgusting.
 What are these people going to think?

606
00:44:02,231 --> 00:44:05,864
I haven't had anything since noon.
 Stop calling me "Tubby" all the time.

607
00:44:05,864 --> 00:44:07,398
- Okay, Tom.
 - Okay, Jerry.

608
00:44:07,398 --> 00:44:11,264
Okay, well,
 I think you should watch your figure.

609
00:44:11,264 --> 00:44:13,626
Do you think that that's attractive?

610
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:19,431
Look at the captain's wife.
 You think she thinks you're hot?

611
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:20,725
- With these jelly rolls?
 - Stop it.

612
00:44:22,064 --> 00:44:24,097
- Do you like having that?
 - Stop it.

613
00:44:24,097 --> 00:44:26,062
Look at her, she's not that old.

614
00:44:28,297 --> 00:44:32,751
Pardon me, ma'am. You would be
 completely acceptable to her...

615
00:44:33,498 --> 00:44:35,792
...if it wasn't for that body.

616
00:44:37,031 --> 00:44:38,791
You should follow her lead.

617
00:44:40,997 --> 00:44:43,189
Now, that is a well-toned body.

618
00:44:44,197 --> 00:44:46,897
There's not an extra calorie on it.

619
00:44:46,897 --> 00:44:48,764
I'm not so sure.

620
00:44:48,764 --> 00:44:50,024
What?

621
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:51,927
Did you hear that?

622
00:44:52,563 --> 00:44:56,824
Tubby, that's really rude.
 Are we gonna take that, ma'am?

623
00:44:58,764 --> 00:45:01,264
- Oh, no.
 - Hey.

624
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:03,728
Indian. You.

625
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,688
What's your name anyway?

626
00:45:13,197 --> 00:45:14,991
George.

627
00:45:15,497 --> 00:45:18,361
George? Just like Daddy.

628
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:21,692
That's really sweet.

629
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:23,930
Come here, Georgie.

630
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,088
Come here.

631
00:45:26,597 --> 00:45:28,222
Come here.

632
00:45:28,997 --> 00:45:31,997
Come on,
 we're gonna play a game now.

633
00:45:31,997 --> 00:45:33,797
Leave him alone.

634
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:37,397
I know you don't want to play with me,
 but it's a really awesome game.

635
00:45:37,397 --> 00:45:39,794
- It's a fun game, trust me.
 - Leave the boy alone.

636
00:45:40,563 --> 00:45:43,197
You see how your mom fights for you?

637
00:45:43,197 --> 00:45:46,064
- Your daddy could learn from her.
 - Stop it.

638
00:45:46,064 --> 00:45:48,363
That's why
 we're gonna let her play too.

639
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:50,692
Tubby, take Georgie for a second.

640
00:45:51,864 --> 00:45:55,597
You see, this is an awesome game.
 It's called Cat in a Bag.

641
00:45:55,597 --> 00:45:58,357
It's really fun. Here we go.

642
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,697
Don't panic. Nothing's going to happen.
 I said it was a fun game.

643
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:07,390
It's a family game. Daddy can play, too,
 so he doesn't get bored.

644
00:46:08,097 --> 00:46:12,530
Hey, Georgie. It's no fun
 if you keep moving around, okay?

645
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,791
Hey! Listen to me.

646
00:46:16,864 --> 00:46:18,692
That's better.

647
00:46:21,497 --> 00:46:25,758
Now, listen, we're a team now,
 aren't we?

648
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,922
Does the cover bother you?

649
00:46:32,797 --> 00:46:34,989
Are you getting enough air?

650
00:46:35,897 --> 00:46:37,486
Are you?

651
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:41,497
- Georgie? Are you?
 - Yes.

652
00:46:41,497 --> 00:46:43,190
Awesome.

653
00:46:44,031 --> 00:46:45,427
Now we can start.

654
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:50,697
If I remember correctly, Mommy
 and our little Indian wanted to sneak
off.

655
00:46:50,697 --> 00:46:53,890
Now, why was that?
 Tubby, why was that?

656
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:55,925
I don't know.

657
00:46:56,530 --> 00:47:00,497
Is lying allowed? What kind of
 example are you setting for these people?

658
00:47:00,497 --> 00:47:03,428
Tubby, you know exactly
 why she wanted to leave.

659
00:47:03,997 --> 00:47:06,791
Because you started talking
 about her jelly rolls.

660
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,186
You're the one
 who's doubted her perfection.

661
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:15,019
Whatever, it doesn't matter.
 Anyway...

662
00:47:16,597 --> 00:47:20,756
...I understand why she was
 embarrassed in front of the boy here.

663
00:47:21,397 --> 00:47:24,363
That's why we're playing
 Cat in the Bag.

664
00:47:24,363 --> 00:47:27,430
To preserve moral decency.

665
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,895
Now the kid is in the bag.

666
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:34,084
Now let's see if Mommy's titties sag.

667
00:47:41,163 --> 00:47:43,497
We don't want to hurt
 the kitty-cat, right?

668
00:47:43,497 --> 00:47:45,196
Leave him alone.

669
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,889
Exactly. Daddy would like to play too.

670
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,986
Oh, God.

671
00:47:52,764 --> 00:47:54,092
What are we waiting for?

672
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:57,263
Tell your wife not to be shy.

673
00:47:57,263 --> 00:48:01,217
It's silly.
 I'm sure she doesn't have jelly rolls.

674
00:48:03,263 --> 00:48:05,194
Please, leave him alone.

675
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:09,587
You just have to tell her
 to take off her clothes.

676
00:48:10,196 --> 00:48:11,354
Please.

677
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:14,992
"Take off your clothes, honey."

678
00:48:33,697 --> 00:48:35,787
Take off your clothes.

679
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:40,684
"Take off your clothes, honey."

680
00:48:54,263 --> 00:48:56,921
Take off your clothes, honey.

681
00:50:33,729 --> 00:50:35,422
Bravo.

682
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:41,427
What did I say? No jelly rolls.

683
00:50:41,996 --> 00:50:45,291
And now we can get dressed again.
 Thank you.

684
00:51:13,497 --> 00:51:15,929
Gross. Tubby, come here.
 Take this piglet.

685
00:51:15,929 --> 00:51:18,096
He's not even house broken yet.

686
00:51:18,096 --> 00:51:20,263
- Go change his diaper.
 - I'll take him.

687
00:51:20,263 --> 00:51:23,023
It's okay,
 I'm not doing anything to him.

688
00:51:23,929 --> 00:51:25,189
Let go of him!

689
00:52:23,196 --> 00:52:24,696
Here.

690
00:52:24,696 --> 00:52:25,991
Have a seat.

691
00:52:26,863 --> 00:52:28,885
Have a seat.

692
00:52:32,529 --> 00:52:34,994
I would advise you not to kick.

693
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:53,055
I hope you don't get bored with him.

694
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:58,921
If you do,
 dump a bucket of water on his head.

695
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,758
But be careful, don't ruin the carpet.

696
00:53:31,696 --> 00:53:34,295
No, it's just a joke.

697
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:36,562
I have to take my SATs again
 in the fall...

698
00:53:36,562 --> 00:53:39,527
...and then I'll go to college
 and study business.

699
00:53:45,362 --> 00:53:47,224
Does it hurt badly?

700
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:50,496
Why don't you just kill us?

701
00:53:50,496 --> 00:53:52,552
You shouldn't forget the importance
 of entertainment.

702
00:54:38,796 --> 00:54:43,262
I'm sorry about the leg, but it's
 really your own fault, if I may say so.

703
00:54:43,262 --> 00:54:45,887
I mean, why did you slap Paul?

704
00:54:46,696 --> 00:54:50,362
And the pointless begging for the eggs
 was pretty uncomfortable for me.

705
00:54:50,362 --> 00:54:51,763
Degrading, actually.

706
00:54:51,763 --> 00:54:53,896
I don't know if that's clear to you.

707
00:54:53,896 --> 00:54:57,622
If you think about it, all of this,
 just for a carton of eggs.

708
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:00,793
In fact, they must still be there.

709
00:55:04,095 --> 00:55:06,496
Besides, you should've
 listened to your wife.

710
00:55:06,496 --> 00:55:09,429
She practically begged you
 to let us leave with the eggs.

711
00:55:09,429 --> 00:55:12,792
But then, of course,
 everyone's always smarter in hindsight.

712
00:55:13,362 --> 00:55:15,054
Here they are.

713
00:55:15,629 --> 00:55:18,362
One is cracked, but not bad.

714
00:55:18,362 --> 00:55:21,691
These egg cartons can really
 take a lot, considering.

715
00:55:22,895 --> 00:55:26,295
Why are you doing that?
 How stupid do you think I am?

716
00:55:26,295 --> 00:55:28,496
I don't understand,
 what are you thinking?

717
00:55:28,496 --> 00:55:31,222
You're practically forcing me
 to treat you badly.

718
00:55:35,696 --> 00:55:38,696
Shit! Now you've really done it.

719
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:41,593
And Paul specifically told us
 to be careful with the carpet.

720
00:55:46,029 --> 00:55:48,426
Please, just let us go.

721
00:55:52,295 --> 00:55:56,988
Look, you have everything
 ahead of you, you're still so young.

722
00:55:59,262 --> 00:56:01,095
Nothing's really happened yet.

723
00:56:01,095 --> 00:56:04,583
We can just say George's leg
 broke on the boat.

724
00:56:06,295 --> 00:56:08,496
Everyone will believe us,
 I promise you.

725
00:56:08,496 --> 00:56:10,995
- Please, don't do this.
 - Please, just...

726
00:56:10,995 --> 00:56:16,052
Why are you degrading yourself?
 This is as painful for me as it is for you.

727
00:56:49,728 --> 00:56:50,988
Georgie?

728
00:56:52,562 --> 00:56:54,550
Where are you?

729
00:58:24,561 --> 00:58:25,890
Georgie.

730
00:58:26,528 --> 00:58:28,516
I'm coming.

731
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:28,417
Wait a second.
 I'm gonna play a little music for us.

732
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:01,184
- Hi, Georgie.
 - Don't come any closer.

733
01:00:03,128 --> 01:00:04,991
Cock it.

734
01:00:06,495 --> 01:00:08,722
Pull the handle back.

735
01:00:38,194 --> 01:00:39,989
Pull the trigger.

736
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:01,862
...instead,
 urged compromise and said emotions...

737
01:01:01,862 --> 01:01:04,294
- to the museum.
 - Oh.

738
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:05,895
You were great!

739
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:08,128
a good rehearsal.

740
01:01:08,128 --> 01:01:11,762
Damage is mostly along the coast.
 The tide in some spots...

741
01:01:11,762 --> 01:01:14,862
his second win
 at Talladega Superspeedway.

742
01:01:14,862 --> 01:01:18,895
And trying to do what he has to do
 to win the championship.

743
01:01:18,895 --> 01:01:22,695
And that means he really needs
 to win this race and Iowa...

744
01:01:22,695 --> 01:01:27,261
...and he needs to see Frank Kimble
 finish out of the top 26.

745
01:01:27,261 --> 01:01:28,528
That's all he can do.

746
01:01:28,528 --> 01:01:30,495
He does. You had it figured earlier.

747
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,628
It can happen.
 He knows what he has to do.

748
01:01:32,628 --> 01:01:34,762
He sat on the pole.
 He has to win here...

749
01:01:34,762 --> 01:01:37,495
...then go into Iowa
 and give it everything he's got.

750
01:01:37,495 --> 01:01:40,495
Bobby Gerhart put so much effort
 into Superspeedway...

751
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:41,824
Honey, I'm home.

752
01:01:43,795 --> 01:01:45,495
Mommy!

753
01:01:45,495 --> 01:01:50,586
What is it, baby?
 You're okay, aren't you? Aren't you?

754
01:01:53,428 --> 01:01:54,894
They killed Jenny.

755
01:01:54,894 --> 01:01:57,028
- Hey, Beavis.
 - Hey, Butt-Head.

756
01:01:57,028 --> 01:01:59,294
- Everything under control?
 - Looks that way.

757
01:01:59,294 --> 01:02:00,691
Good.

758
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:03,294
May I?

759
01:02:03,294 --> 01:02:05,623
Please, be my guest.

760
01:02:06,994 --> 01:02:11,628
I'm sure you're wondering, captain,
 where this hunting rifle came from.

761
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:13,294
Or does it look familiar?

762
01:02:13,294 --> 01:02:16,028
Did you ever go hunting with Fred?

763
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:21,187
Can you believe that your darling
 little boy just tried to kill me with this?

764
01:02:21,728 --> 01:02:24,261
I know it's hard to believe,
 but it's the truth...

765
01:02:24,261 --> 01:02:27,021
...and nothing but the truth,
 right, Georgie?

766
01:02:31,428 --> 01:02:34,094
- What do you think about that, Tom?
 - That's bad.

767
01:02:34,094 --> 01:02:36,361
What time is it?

768
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:37,794
After 11.

769
01:02:37,794 --> 01:02:41,628
I think we should think about
 winning our bet, don't you?

770
01:02:41,628 --> 01:02:45,128
In fact, we should be very grateful
 to little Georgie here...

771
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:48,059
...for helping us out so much.

772
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:51,094
One for Beavis.

773
01:02:51,094 --> 01:02:52,991
One for Butt-Head.

774
01:02:54,994 --> 01:02:56,686
Okay.

775
01:02:59,128 --> 01:03:02,228
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo
 Catch the tiger by the toe

776
01:03:02,228 --> 01:03:07,524
If he hollers let him go
 Eenie, meenie, minie, mo

777
01:03:12,361 --> 01:03:14,053
You look really blue.

778
01:03:14,727 --> 01:03:17,022
Tell me now, how old are you?

779
01:03:20,261 --> 01:03:22,385
She doesn't wanna play.

780
01:03:23,794 --> 01:03:26,228
How old do you think she is?

781
01:03:26,228 --> 01:03:28,022
Thirty, 37?

782
01:03:29,428 --> 01:03:31,052
No jelly rolls.

783
01:03:31,994 --> 01:03:36,094
Let's be generous, let's say 35, okay?

784
01:03:36,094 --> 01:03:37,786
You agree?

785
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:40,594
She agrees.

786
01:03:40,594 --> 01:03:43,228
So who do you want to start with?

787
01:03:43,228 --> 01:03:44,692
With her?

788
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,616
Good.

789
01:03:47,294 --> 01:03:50,088
Now, I'll get something to eat.

790
01:03:53,495 --> 01:03:57,550
One, two, three, four, five,
 six, seven...

791
01:04:12,361 --> 01:04:14,882
Does anyone want anything?

792
01:04:16,594 --> 01:04:18,116
Hm?

793
01:04:43,894 --> 01:04:45,927
You're an idiot, Tubby.

794
01:04:45,927 --> 01:04:49,761
You don't kill the person who's
 counted out, you kill the one left over.

795
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,994
What's wrong with you?

796
01:04:51,994 --> 01:04:54,361
- He tried to run away.
 - So what?

797
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:56,627
That's no reason to get trigger-happy.

798
01:04:56,627 --> 01:04:59,560
Don't you have any sense of timing?

799
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,422
What time is it?

800
01:05:01,994 --> 01:05:04,927
- Almost 12.
 - Shit.

801
01:05:04,927 --> 01:05:06,755
They're spent.

802
01:05:07,861 --> 01:05:12,394
- Come on, let's get out of here.
 - Okay.

803
01:05:12,394 --> 01:05:17,292
Thanks for the driver.
 I'm gonna put it back in the bag, okay?

804
01:05:18,061 --> 01:05:19,560
Yes?

805
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:24,389
- Okay, thanks. Have a nice evening.
 - See you.

806
01:05:25,327 --> 01:05:26,627
Ciao.

807
01:05:26,627 --> 01:05:29,128
Juan Montoya gave
 a shove to Steve Wallace.

808
01:05:29,128 --> 01:05:33,786
Wallace took over the point, Gerhart
 dropped all the way back to ninth.

809
01:05:36,727 --> 01:05:39,861
Blake Bjorklund throwing his name
 into the hat as well.

810
01:05:39,861 --> 01:05:44,694
As far as potential drivers
 wanting to win here at Talladega...

811
01:05:44,694 --> 01:05:49,761
...Pete Shepherd, another development
 driver in the 39 for Roush Racing.

812
01:05:49,761 --> 01:05:51,727
Jack Roush
 actually made the comment:

813
01:05:51,727 --> 01:05:54,886
"He reminds me
 of a young Mark Martin."

814
01:05:55,627 --> 01:05:59,627
Pretty big impressive statement
 from Jack Roush. Bob Dillner.

815
01:05:59,627 --> 01:06:02,360
You never know
 what's gonna happen on pit road.

816
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:06,193
Pretty funny. Just a second ago,
 Brad Parrott ran down here.

817
01:06:06,193 --> 01:06:09,627
You see him right now.
 He's in the 61 pit stall...

818
01:06:09,627 --> 01:06:12,927
...and that's because
 those two are working together.

819
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:16,427
In fact, Juan Montoya
 came over the radio and said:

820
01:06:16,427 --> 01:06:20,927
"I am going to stick to the back bumper
 of the 61 like glue...

821
01:06:20,927 --> 01:06:22,727
...until the white flag."

822
01:06:22,727 --> 01:06:26,293
So Brad Parrott ran down here
 to the crew just to explain things...

823
01:06:26,293 --> 01:06:29,020
...and apparently stayed there
 just to hang out a little bit.

824
01:06:29,994 --> 01:06:33,293
Well, wait a second,
 you can't tell your strategy...

825
01:06:33,293 --> 01:06:35,727
...to the guy you're racing against.

826
01:06:35,727 --> 01:06:38,061
Well, they're saying that now.

827
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:42,227
If the cars get shuffled, that outside line
 gets running, they could get busted up.

828
01:06:42,227 --> 01:06:45,293
Juan on the radio minutes ago,
 talking to his father, saying:

829
01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:48,761
"Where do I go? The high side,
 the low side? What line do I get in?"

830
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:50,726
Nobody said nothing.

831
01:07:31,227 --> 01:07:33,249
They've gone.

832
01:07:42,861 --> 01:07:45,087
Do you hear that?

833
01:07:51,027 --> 01:07:52,492
They're gone.

834
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,018
I'Il... I'll get a knife.

835
01:11:44,693 --> 01:11:46,385
Calm down.

836
01:11:47,027 --> 01:11:50,254
Just breathe. Please, just breathe.

837
01:11:52,526 --> 01:11:54,526
Please, breathe.

838
01:11:54,526 --> 01:11:56,582
Breathe, breathe.

839
01:12:37,626 --> 01:12:39,921
We gotta get out of here.

840
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:50,489
They may come back.

841
01:12:51,793 --> 01:12:53,088
We...

842
01:12:54,559 --> 01:12:56,683
We need to go.

843
01:13:01,292 --> 01:13:03,189
Okay.

844
01:13:05,027 --> 01:13:06,924
Can you walk?

845
01:13:08,292 --> 01:13:11,416
- I'll help you.
 - I'll try.

846
01:13:22,192 --> 01:13:23,987
What is it?

847
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,688
Okay.

848
01:13:56,493 --> 01:13:58,253
Okay.

849
01:14:49,726 --> 01:14:53,179
Let's go. Please, let's go.

850
01:15:26,493 --> 01:15:28,082
It's locked.

851
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:33,755
We'll have to go through the window.

852
01:15:37,725 --> 01:15:39,554
Oh, God.

853
01:15:40,426 --> 01:15:43,092
George, please, please.

854
01:15:43,092 --> 01:15:46,393
I can't, baby. I can't.

855
01:15:46,393 --> 01:15:49,586
Come on. Come on.

856
01:15:51,259 --> 01:15:53,426
You go.

857
01:15:53,426 --> 01:15:56,879
You go. Okay?

858
01:15:57,759 --> 01:16:02,292
If they locked the door,
 they probably locked the gate too.

859
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:04,052
You're right.

860
01:16:07,092 --> 01:16:09,523
Take the pliers, okay?

861
01:16:10,593 --> 01:16:13,023
Cut through the fence.

862
01:16:13,892 --> 01:16:18,292
Be careful when you get to the street,
 they might be waiting, okay?

863
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:20,052
Where are the pliers?

864
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:23,523
Fuck.

865
01:16:25,592 --> 01:16:27,992
They're in the kitchen, I think.

866
01:16:27,992 --> 01:16:29,581
No. In the greenhouse.

867
01:16:30,859 --> 01:16:34,426
Hon, please, you got to get dressed,
 don't you?

868
01:16:34,426 --> 01:16:38,289
Put some shoes on
 because you might have to run.

869
01:16:39,426 --> 01:16:41,526
I can't leave you here, no.

870
01:16:41,526 --> 01:16:44,979
Just go. We're losing time.

871
01:16:46,426 --> 01:16:50,084
No, wait, the bag's here.
 The bag's here, so...

872
01:16:59,592 --> 01:17:01,792
I'll hide in the cellar.

873
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:04,848
Okay? I'll wait for you.

874
01:17:07,393 --> 01:17:09,550
How will you get down there?

875
01:17:10,925 --> 01:17:12,426
I don't know.

876
01:17:12,426 --> 01:17:15,391
- Fuck.
 - I'll manage, though.

877
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:29,520
Please, just go.

878
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:32,513
Please.

879
01:17:52,925 --> 01:17:54,992
George, it's working.

880
01:17:54,992 --> 01:17:58,925
- What?
 - It must have dried. It's working again.

881
01:17:58,925 --> 01:18:00,692
Call someone.

882
01:18:00,692 --> 01:18:03,123
- Who?
 - The police.

883
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:05,554
Okay.

884
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:18,489
It isn't ringing.

885
01:18:19,226 --> 01:18:21,054
Let me listen.

886
01:18:29,258 --> 01:18:31,425
It's probably still wet.

887
01:18:31,425 --> 01:18:33,549
There's a signal.

888
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:36,385
Wait a minute.

889
01:18:47,792 --> 01:18:49,189
Where's yours?

890
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:52,688
It's in the fucking car.

891
01:19:21,425 --> 01:19:23,287
Nothing.

892
01:19:26,492 --> 01:19:29,859
Get the hair dryer. That might work.

893
01:19:29,859 --> 01:19:31,346
Here.

894
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:34,683
- I need a chair.
 - Oh, God.

895
01:19:36,059 --> 01:19:38,047
I'm sorry.

896
01:19:54,625 --> 01:19:57,112
It's not working, honey.

897
01:21:32,058 --> 01:21:33,592
Forget it.

898
01:21:33,592 --> 01:21:35,125
Forget it.

899
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:37,352
Maybe it just doesn't work.

900
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:40,113
We're wasting time.

901
01:21:40,725 --> 01:21:44,019
Just pull me over in the chair. I'll try.

902
01:21:44,558 --> 01:21:46,091
Okay?

903
01:21:46,091 --> 01:21:47,991
You got to go now.

904
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:49,547
Okay.

905
01:21:52,358 --> 01:21:54,118
Shit, sorry.

906
01:22:16,058 --> 01:22:18,091
You gotta go.

907
01:22:18,091 --> 01:22:20,058
- Go, now.
 - Okay.

908
01:22:20,058 --> 01:22:21,291
Please.

909
01:22:21,291 --> 01:22:22,983
Ann.

910
01:22:27,091 --> 01:22:29,181
Please forgive me.

911
01:22:44,091 --> 01:22:46,578
I love you.

912
01:22:50,058 --> 01:22:52,046
I love you.

913
01:22:53,225 --> 01:22:54,281
I love you.

914
01:22:54,891 --> 01:22:57,691
You run, okay?

915
01:22:57,691 --> 01:22:59,122
Just run.

916
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:58,051
Hello!

917
01:25:02,257 --> 01:25:04,524
Hello!

918
01:25:04,524 --> 01:25:06,751
Help me!

919
01:25:07,524 --> 01:25:09,580
Help!

920
01:25:51,691 --> 01:25:53,246
Hello?

921
01:25:54,058 --> 01:25:57,491
Can you hear me?
 This is George Farber.

922
01:25:57,491 --> 01:26:01,718
I live at 55 Neck Lane...

923
01:26:02,591 --> 01:26:04,852
...in the head of the harbor.

924
01:26:07,257 --> 01:26:09,586
They killed my son.

925
01:26:14,557 --> 01:26:16,522
Can you hear me?

926
01:26:18,858 --> 01:26:19,914
Shit.

927
01:26:39,024 --> 01:26:42,353
Hello? I just called.

928
01:28:27,224 --> 01:28:29,848
Hey! Hey!

929
01:28:30,857 --> 01:28:32,754
Wait!

930
01:30:07,224 --> 01:30:08,848
Ann?

931
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:37,778
Player one, level two.

932
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:45,623
Damn it.

933
01:30:45,623 --> 01:30:47,588
Good morning, captain.

934
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:51,249
Good morning.

935
01:30:52,957 --> 01:30:55,690
They'll be here any minute.

936
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:59,190
Then we'd better hurry, right, Beavis?

937
01:30:59,190 --> 01:31:00,990
How old did we say? 37?

938
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:02,623
- Thirty-five.
 - Okay, 35.

939
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:05,356
- Why won't you believe me?
 - One, two, three...

940
01:31:05,356 --> 01:31:07,723
- It's a good thing the charger's
 in the car.

941
01:31:07,723 --> 01:31:10,890
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

942
01:31:10,890 --> 01:31:13,723
If it's her age,
 you have to start with her.

943
01:31:13,723 --> 01:31:14,890
Why?

944
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:17,024
Because those are the rules, blockhead.

945
01:31:17,024 --> 01:31:19,523
Okay, well, I'll start with her, then.

946
01:31:19,523 --> 01:31:21,224
The battery wasn't dead yet.

947
01:31:21,224 --> 01:31:24,390
- One, two, three, four...
 - Yeah, I know.

948
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:28,057
It's time to think of something new.
 The lady tried that this afternoon.

949
01:31:28,057 --> 01:31:31,124
- Count faster, Beavis.
 - Eleven, 12, 13, 14...

950
01:31:31,124 --> 01:31:33,289
I mean,
 how primitive do you think we are?

951
01:31:33,289 --> 01:31:36,556
It's not a bet if there's nothing at stake,
 right, captain?

952
01:31:36,556 --> 01:31:38,723
I mean, even you need a chance.

953
01:31:38,723 --> 01:31:42,423
The wind blows where it wants to.
 That's why sailing is fun.

954
01:31:42,423 --> 01:31:45,423
- Twenty-nine, 30, 31, 32...
 - Right, isn't it?

955
01:31:45,423 --> 01:31:48,723
...33, 34, 35.

956
01:31:48,723 --> 01:31:51,423
Now, don't make
 the same mistake twice.

957
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:54,855
It's not the person counted out,
 it's the one left over.

958
01:31:58,623 --> 01:32:00,178
Wait a minute.

959
01:32:00,757 --> 01:32:02,623
I see a new toy.

960
01:32:02,623 --> 01:32:05,111
I think we have the lady
 to thank for this.

961
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:10,355
This is gonna make things
 a little bit more interesting.

962
01:32:11,289 --> 01:32:13,846
It's boring when mutes suffer.

963
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:18,857
We want to entertain our audience,
 right?

964
01:32:18,857 --> 01:32:21,117
Show them what we can do.

965
01:32:27,623 --> 01:32:30,089
You're allowed to play another game.

966
01:32:30,089 --> 01:32:34,384
The name of this game
 is The Loving Wife.

967
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:36,978
Otherwise known as:

968
01:32:37,490 --> 01:32:40,978
Whether by Knife
 or Whether by Gun...

969
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:45,186
...Losing Your Life
 Can Sometimes Be Fun.

970
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:48,252
Come on, don't fall asleep.

971
01:32:48,757 --> 01:32:51,556
You have to play,
 otherwise I have to gag you again...

972
01:32:51,556 --> 01:32:53,885
...and you don't like that, do you?

973
01:32:56,056 --> 01:32:59,356
So the rules of this game are...

974
01:32:59,356 --> 01:33:02,390
...Georgie Sr. is counted out, okay?

975
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:05,056
He's up next.
 There's nothing to be done about it...

976
01:33:05,056 --> 01:33:07,749
...unless you wanna jump in for him.
 Do you?

977
01:33:09,056 --> 01:33:12,356
Do you? Beavis is not gonna mind.
 Right, Tubby?

978
01:33:12,356 --> 01:33:14,723
- Don't call me Tubby.
 - See, he doesn't mind.

979
01:33:14,723 --> 01:33:18,523
- Just get on with it, this is enough.
 - Enough?

980
01:33:18,523 --> 01:33:21,289
You really think it's enough?
 What about you, Ann?

981
01:33:21,289 --> 01:33:24,390
Do you think it's enough,
 or you wanna keep playing?

982
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:29,256
Don't answer. Let them do
 what they want, it'll be over faster.

983
01:33:29,256 --> 01:33:30,721
Oh, come on.

984
01:33:31,289 --> 01:33:33,720
Stop being such a coward.

985
01:33:34,289 --> 01:33:37,989
Do you think it's enough?
 I mean, you want a real ending, right?

986
01:33:37,989 --> 01:33:42,223
With plausible plot development,
 don't you?

987
01:33:42,223 --> 01:33:45,223
The bet is still on.
 You can't cancel it by yourself.

988
01:33:45,223 --> 01:33:48,856
So the name of the game
 is The Loving Wife.

989
01:33:48,856 --> 01:33:52,056
Now, although Beavis
 is already finished counting...

990
01:33:52,056 --> 01:33:55,623
...Ann can decide who's up next...

991
01:33:55,623 --> 01:33:58,554
...and with which device.

992
01:34:01,056 --> 01:34:02,884
Which do you prefer?

993
01:34:04,056 --> 01:34:07,749
The little knife or the big gun?

994
01:34:09,289 --> 01:34:11,720
What's the housewife's choice?

995
01:34:14,289 --> 01:34:16,618
You have to admit, Ann...

996
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:20,123
...I'm being very generous here.

997
01:34:20,123 --> 01:34:23,849
You can prove to your pussy husband
 how much you love him.

998
01:34:25,056 --> 01:34:29,856
And between friends,
 it barely costs you anything.

999
01:34:29,856 --> 01:34:33,690
Doesn't really matter
 if you crap out now or later.

1000
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:35,523
Right?

1001
01:34:35,523 --> 01:34:38,789
Hello! Wake up!
 What, you're not interested?

1002
01:34:38,789 --> 01:34:44,623
You don't want to play anymore? Beavis,
 show her how the game is played. Here.

1003
01:34:44,623 --> 01:34:46,523
Watch out.

1004
01:34:46,523 --> 01:34:49,420
- I almost cut myself.
 - Really?

1005
01:34:58,523 --> 01:35:02,477
Come on, come on, sit down,
 sit down, sit down.

1006
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:07,713
That's the little knife.

1007
01:35:10,256 --> 01:35:13,346
Ann, you can spare him the pain.

1008
01:35:14,023 --> 01:35:17,614
You just... You have to play with us.

1009
01:35:20,922 --> 01:35:23,513
Everything's gonna be fine.

1010
01:35:32,056 --> 01:35:36,885
- What do you want me to do?
 - You see, wasn't so difficult.

1011
01:35:40,556 --> 01:35:42,214
Good.

1012
01:35:46,689 --> 01:35:47,915
Okay.

1013
01:35:49,256 --> 01:35:51,118
Say a prayer.

1014
01:35:51,989 --> 01:35:53,622
Any one you want.

1015
01:35:53,622 --> 01:35:57,490
If you can say it
 without any mistakes...

1016
01:35:57,490 --> 01:35:59,555
...then God is on your side...

1017
01:35:59,555 --> 01:36:02,889
...and you get to choose
 what happens next.

1018
01:36:02,889 --> 01:36:04,411
Okay?

1019
01:36:05,989 --> 01:36:09,613
Okay? Or should we continue
 with Georgie Sr?

1020
01:36:15,989 --> 01:36:18,476
I don't know any prayers.

1021
01:36:21,356 --> 01:36:23,513
You don't know any prayers?

1022
01:36:24,223 --> 01:36:25,915
Not even one?

1023
01:36:26,722 --> 01:36:30,522
Is that possible?
 Where the...? Where the hell are we?

1024
01:36:30,522 --> 01:36:34,989
- Tubby, tell her one.
 - Stop calling me "Tubby" all the time.

1025
01:36:34,989 --> 01:36:36,476
Okay, fine.

1026
01:36:36,989 --> 01:36:38,783
Tell her one.

1027
01:36:41,989 --> 01:36:45,545
I love you, God, with all my might
 Keep me safe all through the night

1028
01:36:47,056 --> 01:36:50,487
- That's too short.
 - I don't know any others.

1029
01:36:51,223 --> 01:36:52,482
Okay.

1030
01:36:53,223 --> 01:36:57,620
I love you, God, with all my might
 Keep me safe all through the night

1031
01:36:59,356 --> 01:37:01,256
I love you, God, with all my might...

1032
01:37:01,256 --> 01:37:04,345
No, you can't say it like that.
 It's a prayer, Ann.

1033
01:37:05,089 --> 01:37:09,986
You can't just drone on like that.
 You're asking the Lord for something...

1034
01:37:11,689 --> 01:37:13,856
...so pray properly.

1035
01:37:13,856 --> 01:37:16,722
Come on, get down on your knees.

1036
01:37:16,722 --> 01:37:21,279
Yeah, kneel properly.
 Put your hands together. That's good.

1037
01:37:22,023 --> 01:37:23,989
Not on your stomach.

1038
01:37:23,989 --> 01:37:28,716
Where's the person you're praying to, hm?
 Up there, right? So, pray up there.

1039
01:37:29,355 --> 01:37:31,223
Now, Ann...

1040
01:37:31,223 --> 01:37:35,177
...from the bottom of your heart, pray.

1041
01:37:37,023 --> 01:37:41,079
- Beavis, can you help me out here?
 - No!

1042
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:46,789
Oh, God, I love you, God,
 with all my might.

1043
01:37:46,789 --> 01:37:52,016
Please, keep me safe
 all through the night, please.

1044
01:37:54,422 --> 01:37:56,288
Bravo.

1045
01:37:56,288 --> 01:37:59,015
That was fantastic.

1046
01:37:59,722 --> 01:38:03,489
Okay, that was the test run. Now
 we're gonna go for the Olympic Gold.

1047
01:38:03,489 --> 01:38:06,188
If you can say this...

1048
01:38:06,188 --> 01:38:11,422
...little, unfortunately,
 much too short of a prayer backwards...

1049
01:38:11,422 --> 01:38:13,222
...with no mistakes...

1050
01:38:13,222 --> 01:38:18,288
...not only will you be able to decide
 which one of you bites it first...

1051
01:38:18,288 --> 01:38:21,355
...but also... And I'm sure this
 is gonna interest you more.

1052
01:38:21,355 --> 01:38:23,183
with which device...

1053
01:38:24,689 --> 01:38:28,422
...whether it's the fast
 and almost painless big gun...

1054
01:38:28,422 --> 01:38:30,012
...or the slow, drawn-out...

1055
01:38:32,622 --> 01:38:34,416
Look out!

1056
01:38:45,722 --> 01:38:47,414
Shit.

1057
01:38:48,922 --> 01:38:53,216
Where's the remote control?
 Where's the fucking remote control?

1058
01:39:24,622 --> 01:39:26,288
Okay, that was the test run.

1059
01:39:26,288 --> 01:39:28,355
Now we're gonna go
 for the Olympic Gold.

1060
01:39:28,355 --> 01:39:31,122
If you can say this...

1061
01:39:31,122 --> 01:39:36,288
...little, unfortunately,
 much too short of a prayer backwards...

1062
01:39:36,288 --> 01:39:38,122
...with no mistakes...

1063
01:39:38,122 --> 01:39:43,055
...not only will you be able to decide
 which one of you bites it first...

1064
01:39:43,055 --> 01:39:46,288
...but also... And I'm sure
 this is gonna interest you even more.

1065
01:39:46,288 --> 01:39:48,082
with which device...

1066
01:39:49,589 --> 01:39:53,255
...whether it's the fast
 and almost painless big gun...

1067
01:39:53,255 --> 01:39:54,913
...or the slow, drawn-out...

1068
01:40:00,522 --> 01:40:02,918
You shouldn't have done that, Ann.

1069
01:40:03,555 --> 01:40:05,747
You're not allowed to break the rules.

1070
01:40:07,055 --> 01:40:09,188
I'm sorry.

1071
01:40:09,188 --> 01:40:10,744
You failed.

1072
01:40:13,522 --> 01:40:15,918
Say goodbye to Georgie.

1073
01:41:04,888 --> 01:41:07,410
Would you please take a seat?

1074
01:41:57,921 --> 01:42:00,011
Give me your gloves.

1075
01:42:05,988 --> 01:42:07,755
So everything
 is its mirror image.

1076
01:42:07,755 --> 01:42:10,921
But, of course, all these predictions
 are lies to avoid panic.

1077
01:42:10,921 --> 01:42:12,755
Now Kelvin knows what's going on.

1078
01:42:12,755 --> 01:42:15,188
He wants to warn his wife
 and daughter in time.

1079
01:42:15,188 --> 01:42:18,422
The problem isn't only
 how to escape the anti-material world...

1080
01:42:18,422 --> 01:42:20,721
...but also how to communicate
 between the two worlds.

1081
01:42:20,721 --> 01:42:22,516
- Finally there's a gap...
 - Look.

1082
01:42:24,422 --> 01:42:27,545
Now, that is what I call Olympic spirit.

1083
01:42:30,755 --> 01:42:33,914
Hey, Tubby, be careful. Jesus.

1084
01:42:34,788 --> 01:42:36,878
Didn't you say you couldn't swim?

1085
01:42:48,255 --> 01:42:51,355
Bring the widow over here,
 otherwise she's gonna get lonely.

1086
01:42:51,355 --> 01:42:54,081
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1087
01:42:54,588 --> 01:42:56,110
Now.

1088
01:42:56,721 --> 01:43:00,982
Help me here, please.
 It's difficult, you might get hurt.

1089
01:43:05,554 --> 01:43:08,088
- So where was I?
 - There we go.

1090
01:43:08,088 --> 01:43:09,882
You were...

1091
01:43:12,421 --> 01:43:16,288
You were discussing the difference
 between communicating...

1092
01:43:16,288 --> 01:43:20,755
...between the material universe
 and the anti-material universe, right?

1093
01:43:20,755 --> 01:43:23,421
Exactly.
 It's like you're inside of a black hole.

1094
01:43:23,421 --> 01:43:26,088
The gravitational force
 is so great that nothing...

1095
01:43:26,088 --> 01:43:29,855
...absolutely nothing can escape, which
 means absolutely no communication.

1096
01:43:29,855 --> 01:43:31,888
- But Kelvin has this...
 - What time is it?

1097
01:43:31,888 --> 01:43:34,751
- What?
 - What's the time?

1098
01:43:36,521 --> 01:43:38,055
After 8.

1099
01:43:38,055 --> 01:43:39,747
Already?

1100
01:43:49,855 --> 01:43:52,621
Why? The deadline was 9.
 She had almost another hour.

1101
01:43:52,621 --> 01:43:55,287
Well, it's too difficult to sail like this...

1102
01:43:55,287 --> 01:43:56,788
...first of all.

1103
01:43:56,788 --> 01:43:58,514
Second of all...

1104
01:43:59,122 --> 01:44:02,609
- ...I'm getting kind of hungry.
 - That's true.

1105
01:44:17,388 --> 01:44:20,055
And when he overcomes
 the gravitational forces...

1106
01:44:20,055 --> 01:44:23,855
...it turns out that one universe
 is real and the other one is fiction.

1107
01:44:23,855 --> 01:44:25,421
How?

1108
01:44:25,421 --> 01:44:28,988
How do I know? It's a kind of
 model projection in cyberspace.

1109
01:44:28,988 --> 01:44:32,488
Okay, so where's your hero now?
 Is he in reality or is he in fiction?

1110
01:44:32,488 --> 01:44:35,187
His family's in reality,
 and he's in fiction.

1111
01:44:35,187 --> 01:44:38,221
- But isn't fiction real?
 - Why?

1112
01:44:38,221 --> 01:44:41,122
Well, you can see it in the movie,
 right?

1113
01:44:41,122 --> 01:44:42,521
Of course.

1114
01:44:42,521 --> 01:44:46,721
Well, then it's just as real as reality...

1115
01:44:46,721 --> 01:44:50,187
...because you can see it too, right?

1116
01:44:50,187 --> 01:44:52,254
Bullshit.

1117
01:44:52,254 --> 01:44:53,378
Why?

1118
01:45:35,621 --> 01:45:36,745
Hello?

1119
01:45:38,254 --> 01:45:40,185
Is anyone there?

1120
01:45:45,388 --> 01:45:47,046
Hello?

1121
01:45:48,021 --> 01:45:49,921
Yes?

1122
01:45:49,921 --> 01:45:51,755
Hello?

1123
01:45:51,755 --> 01:45:54,087
- Hello.
 - Who's there?

1124
01:45:54,087 --> 01:45:58,712
Good morning. I'm sorry
 to bother you so early, ma'am.

1125
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:01,488
Ann sent me.

1126
01:46:01,488 --> 01:46:02,987
Yes?

1127
01:46:02,987 --> 01:46:05,388
You don't remember me, do you?

1128
01:46:05,388 --> 01:46:07,987
We met yesterday, at the dock.

1129
01:46:07,987 --> 01:46:10,121
- Paul.
 - Oh, yes.

1130
01:46:10,121 --> 01:46:12,086
- Good morning.
 - Morning.

1131
01:46:13,755 --> 01:46:15,845
Ann sent me over because...

1132
01:46:16,554 --> 01:46:18,354
Some guests dropped by...

1133
01:46:18,354 --> 01:46:22,254
...and she was wondering if you
 could help her out with some eggs.

1134
01:46:22,254 --> 01:46:23,588
Well, I guess so.

1135
01:46:23,588 --> 01:46:26,354
- It's okay?
 - Yeah, come on in. Just wait a second.

1136
01:46:26,354 --> 01:46:27,909
Okay.
