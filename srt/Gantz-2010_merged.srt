1
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:42,502
I believe that each of us
has a role in life.

2
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:49,433
We all have something
unique to offer.

3
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:54,518
And there's a place where we can
maximize our abilities.

4
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,434
A place where we can maximize
our abilities...

5
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,654
"Be Ready for that Job Interview!"

6
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,868
I'm convinced that your company
is the right place for me.

7
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,570
Isn't that Kato?

8
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,507
Hey, watch out!

9
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:13,555
The express service
will not stop at this station.

10
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,598
The train's coming!

11
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,601
Get the station master!

12
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,320
Get someone!

13
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,859
Here I go.

14
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,576
The train is coming!

15
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,994
Sir, are you OK?

16
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,794
Hey! Can you move?

17
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,921
Somebody, give me a hand here!

18
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,262
He's drunk!

19
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,554
Come on, wake up!

20
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,053
Somebody! Anybody!

21
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,396
Kei...

22
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,647
Is that you, Kei?

23
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,153
Help me!

24
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,193
Damn it.

25
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,203
Come on, on your feet!

26
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,910
Pull him up!

27
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,642
Kato!

28
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,105
Thanks...

29
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,136
What the...?

30
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,470
Two more came.

31
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,513
Come on...

32
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,263
That's Tokyo Tower.

33
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,431
It won't open.

34
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,896
There's no way out.

35
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,105
What is this place? A hospital?

36
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,573
I don't know.

37
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,114
Listen, back at the platform...

38
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,958
- We got run over!
- You ignored me.

39
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:11,752
I didn't... I...didn't see you.

40
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:16,339
I knew you wouldn't!

41
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,089
- Was it at primary school?
- We met three times after that.

42
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,590
Anyway...

43
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,302
Weren't we run over by that train?

44
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,729
We were.

45
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,064
But we're alive.

46
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,565
Just like us.

47
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,116
I got run over by a car.

48
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,985
Where are we?

49
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,660
Heaven! The apartment version!

50
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,499
That's one possibility, but...

51
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,791
It has to be! I know I died.

52
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,175
What's this?

53
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,445
That's how you appeared.

54
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,202
Why is she naked?

55
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,584
- Take that off.
- Hey.

56
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,411
Are you OK?

57
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,746
Rise and shine,
it's a new morning for us

58
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,667
A morning of new hope

59
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,508
Breathe in, a chest full of joy

60
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,470
Look up at the clear, blue sky!

61
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:09,057
Listen to the radio

62
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:13,346
The summer breeze
is so wholesome

63
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,270
Breathe in and exercise now

64
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,145
To the count of one, two and three!

65
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,581
"All of your old lives are gone."

66
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,793
"I will decide how to
use your new lives."

67
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,301
"That's the way the cookie crumbles."

68
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,014
What...?

69
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,805
"You will all please go now
to finish off this guy."

70
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,308
What do you mean, "guy"?

71
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
"Onion Alien"
"He stinks and he likes onions."

72
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,784
What are these?

73
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,810
He's breathing.

74
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,418
He's warm.

75
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,676
Does that mean he's alive?

76
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,096
"Kurono"

77
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,323
It has my name on it.

78
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,325
You're right.

79
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,743
"Yamada..."

80
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,792
- How come...?
- Dunno.

81
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,786
I'm Inamori.

82
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,959
Get all of them.

83
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,604
Cosplay...?

84
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,849
Is this for me?

85
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,272
I guess so.

86
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,400
- Do I put it on?
- Dunno.

87
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,365
"Kishimoto"

88
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,029
Are you Kishimoto...?

89
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,989
You can put this on.

90
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,328
But...

91
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,871
Um...

92
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,996
Am I dead?

93
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,382
I don't really know.

94
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,175
But you're naked, so...

95
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,986
Will it fit?

96
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,656
Were they expecting me?

97
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,265
Is this some kind of a toy?

98
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,391
It's heavy for a toy.

99
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,770
There are no holes on the muzzle.

100
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,647
Oh, yeah...

101
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,275
- Don't point it this way!
- It has no holes, look!

102
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,901
- Point it away!
- Sorry.

103
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,243
Everyone!

104
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,533
Uh... sorry, it's nothing.

105
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,204
You can't stop there.
Tell us.

106
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:36,672
I remember being taken
to a hospital.

107
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:43,425
Then I vaguely remember
being sedated.

108
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,430
Sedated?

109
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:50,899
Yes. I was also hit by a car.

110
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,861
I remember being taken to hospital,
all bloody.

111
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:59,153
And I was drugged there.

112
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,823
That's when I started
to get drowsy...

113
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,412
But wait a minute.

114
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,531
What's suspicious about that?

115
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,617
Sorry, you're right.

116
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,997
I'm beginning to see
the whole picture.

117
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,092
It's like I thought.
We're not dead.

118
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:23,014
We were taken to the hospital
in a coma and drugged.

119
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,476
The drug is making us hallucinate.

120
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,889
Really?

121
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,014
It's like group hypnosis.

122
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,437
See? We're all
seeing the same thing.

123
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,935
That must be it!

124
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,112
We're being forced to take part
in some kind of strange experiment.

125
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,920
What is this thing?

126
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,413
I don't know.

127
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,006
It's a hallucination.

128
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,218
Kei!

129
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,172
"go now, please."

130
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,233
Wow.

131
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,038
We're outside.

132
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,794
We're out now.

133
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,711
I guess we can go home.

134
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,432
I've had enough.

135
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,684
Wait a minute.

136
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,767
You deserve an explanation.

137
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,432
This is for TV.

138
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,478
You're under hypnosis on TV.

139
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,614
See? I knew I wasn't dead!

140
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,034
My father is the producer
of the show.

141
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:55,375
It's a project by American cable TV
and Yale University.

142
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,962
It's a virtual reality show.

143
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,625
Don't you know American Try Out?

144
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,344
If you complete the mission,
you win $100,000.

145
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,635
I begged Dad to put me on the show.

146
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,680
$100,000?

147
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,929
That's 10 million yen!

148
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:22,311
Kato, look over there.

149
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,364
Take a good look.
He's our target on the mission.

150
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,157
Is he, really?

151
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,999
We have 20 minutes.
First one to get him grabs the money!

152
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,671
I'll be damned!

153
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:54,350
I got laid off last month, so...

154
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,812
10 million...!

155
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,187
Wasn't that a child?

156
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,112
Go and see for yourself
if you want to know.

157
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,743
Stop running!

158
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,086
Stop, you brat!

159
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,055
Come on, wait!

160
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,388
Go, spread out!

161
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,689
What's this thing?

162
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You can have my onion.
You can have it.
That's some mask.

163
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,958
You little prick!

164
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,973
Get him!

165
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,105
How come there's nobody around?

166
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:31,360
Are we walking in circles?

167
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,195
"lchinomiya, Tama City"

168
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,415
We're in Tama City.

169
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,673
What's going on?

170
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,646
I'll take a look.

171
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,491
Now there's only us left...

172
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,201
Where do you live?
I'll walk you home.

173
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,824
I'm going, too.

174
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,004
Surround him!

175
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,353
Where is he?

176
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,471
There!

177
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,544
Where did he go?

178
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,372
There he is!

179
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,010
He's fast!

180
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,114
Turn on the light.

181
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,044
So...can I shoot this gun now?

182
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,421
Take my onion.

183
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,182
Take my onion.

184
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,220
Take my onion.

185
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Is that all?

186
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,681
This is real.

187
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,098
God damn!

188
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,643
Ouch!

189
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,190
Damn it!

190
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,181
10 million yen...

191
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,517
It's so realistic.

192
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,897
That's enough!

193
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,927
What are you looking at, punk?!

194
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,171
I'm sorry!

195
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,130
I'm sorry, so let go!

196
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,035
Fire! Shoot the fucker!

197
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,476
Call the police... The police.

198
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:19,431
I know we are going back
to that apartment now...

199
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,978
When's the drug wear off?

200
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:01,896
Kato?

201
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

202
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,685
Oh, God.

203
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,555
I'm OK?

204
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,560
Why?

205
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,691
This is crazy.

206
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,146
Shit.

207
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,825
I knew it.

208
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,014
I'm sorry.

209
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,942
Using the attaché case was creative.

210
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,187
It was close.

211
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,945
Now you know what the suit's for.

212
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:03,572
Shoot him, you deserve the points.
It's on me.

213
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,463
Come on.

214
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,924
He killed everybody.

215
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,455
I like the look in your eye.

216
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,143
You disappoint me.

217
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,196
You won't survive the next round.

218
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,685
It's happening again.

219
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,052
We have so many survivors tonight!

220
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:37,642
Explain! This isn't TV, is it?

221
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,893
Ask Gantz.

222
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:48,657
That's Gantz. When I came along,
people had already called it that.

223
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,102
Hey, I thought you were dead!

224
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:20,435
Even if you're bleeding to death,
you're OK as long as you're alive.

225
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:33,577
"It is time for the scores."

226
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,670
"0 points for Kishimoto,
your tits are too big."

227
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,580
What?

228
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,960
"0 Points for Kato,
your too much of a chicken."

229
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,931
"0 points for Suzuki,
you are so invisible."

230
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,807
Invisible.

231
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,395
"0 points for Kurono,
you stare at Kishimoto too much."

232
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:03,818
"5 points for Nishi,
getting 79 in total."

233
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,984
Just 5 points?

234
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,652
What's this about?

235
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,415
Gantz evaluated our
mission performances.

236
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:20,206
Our mission is to kill
the space invaders.

237
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,917
Who are you?

238
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,721
I'm one, too.

239
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,179
An alien.

240
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,685
Don't get serious.
I'm just kidding!

241
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,694
You arsehole!
What happened to the others?

242
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,827
They got killed. You saw it.

243
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,240
See?

244
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,850
They're the ones who've died
in the Gantz missions.

245
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:26,936
Did you see the way the yakuza
was blown up?

246
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,611
And how Mr. Hypnotism
was trampled on!

247
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,234
He died before he knew it!

248
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,829
It was even more awesome
the other day...

249
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,742
You could have helped those guys!

250
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:46,955
I know, you're one of
those hypocrites.

251
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,761
And you're clueless.

252
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,934
You're taking it out on the wrong guy.

253
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,068
Leave Kato alone!

254
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,652
Will you shoot this time?

255
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,775
Yes, I will.

256
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,627
Tell us what you know.

257
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,796
What is this place?

258
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,543
Talk.

259
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,137
Sorry.

260
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,764
Maybe next time.

261
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,341
Was it a dream?

262
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:45,036
"Witnesses please report"

263
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,626
Is this about the accident
we saw yesterday?

264
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,996
Oh, please don't remind me.

265
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,344
Sorry! There was no toilet paper.

266
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,304
Oh, gross.

267
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:14,399
"..passengers were hit
by the train..."

268
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:17,985
I believe that

269
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:21,986
each of us has a role in life.

270
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:29,330
We all have something unique to offer.

271
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:34,331
And there's a place where we can
maximize our abilities.

272
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,426
What is it that
you want to do here?

273
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:43,298
Pardon?

274
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,800
What position?

275
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:39,688
You don't say that
at a job interview, man.

276
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,031
I'm doing better than Kurono.

277
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,698
- Nobody wants to hire him?
- No.

278
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,492
He's kind of invisible, isn't he?

279
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,366
He's the unemployable type.

280
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,914
He boasts about being
a football star.

281
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,037
At primary school. Come on!

282
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,039
He'll vanish in the real world.

283
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:16,016
That concludes the lecture today.

284
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,531
Don't let them bother you.

285
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,368
I'm kind of invisible too.

286
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,748
What's the best way to get noticed?

287
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,917
When I met my old friend
at the train station...

288
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,250
Kei?

289
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,002
Was it primary school?

290
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,010
Kato!

291
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,057
I'm Kojima.

292
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:55,397
My name's Tae Kojima.

293
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,395
"Students' addresses"

294
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:06,279
"2, Yaguchi, Ota"

295
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:21,749
"Kei Kurono, Masaru Kato"

296
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,175
"Your friend forever, Kato"

297
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,802
Kei, you're my hero!

298
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:37,305
Don't forget I saved your butt!

299
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,274
I won't! We're friends forever!

300
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,525
You're home early, Akira.

301
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,151
It's me, Dad.

302
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:55,699
Kei, I didn't know you were here.
How are you?

303
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,955
I'm going now.

304
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,374
Did you find yourself a good job?

305
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:06,001
I'm working on it.

306
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:11,515
Don't be a slacker. Akira already
has his sights on a college.

307
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,068
There's no house here.

308
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:34,663
"2, Yaguchi, Ota"

309
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:42,379
"lchinomiya, Tama City"

310
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:36,807
Hello.

311
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,601
You know who I am?

312
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:01,415
Hey!

313
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,166
That's the...

314
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,629
I had it on when I woke up.

315
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:14,637
I visited Kato at his house.

316
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:15,971
Kato...

317
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,475
I wanted to...

318
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:24,098
confirm with him
what happened two days ago.

319
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,641
But...

320
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:31,271
it looks like he's moved.

321
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:35,449
I only had an address
from ten years ago.

322
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,203
I see...

323
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,751
Should we go to the police?

324
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,797
They won't believe us.

325
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,796
I guess not.

326
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:01,138
I can walk you to the station.

327
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:09,150
I have a favour to ask you.

328
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,440
- Sure.
- Can I stay over?

329
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,652
Uh-huh.

330
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,363
Huh?

331
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,744
Is it OK if I sleep on the bed?

332
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,166
Of course.

333
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,710
Thank you.

334
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:46,889
I hope I won't have a backache
in the morning...

335
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,515
I'll sleep on the floor.

336
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,358
No, sleep on the bed. I'm OK.

337
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,740
Are you sure you don't have to
go back home?

338
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,948
My boyfriend's things are there.

339
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,456
Oh, you live with him?

340
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:15,633
We broke up recently.
He just moved out.

341
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:24,058
Oh, really.

342
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:37,234
Then on impulse
when I was in the bath...

343
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,190
I slit my wrist.

344
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,244
I didn't really mean to do it.

345
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:54,668
You committed suicide?

346
00:47:56,916 --> 00:48:02,423
When I woke up,
I was back at my place...

347
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:09,346
I was too scared
to look in the bathroom.

348
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,150
I didn't want to see my body
in a pool of blood.

349
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,472
What's that?

350
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,312
I borrowed it from Kato.

351
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,861
I have to see him.

352
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,529
I want to thank him for being kind.

353
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,283
It's his diary.

354
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,960
Maybe his address is in here.

355
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,508
Parole officer?

356
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:34,847
"Masaru Kato, on parole."

357
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,313
Was he in juvie?

358
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,815
- Let's stop.
- I saw his address.

359
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,072
Now I remember.

360
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:56,795
I heard that he never went
to high school.

361
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,464
That's nothing to do with us.

362
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:06,133
There was lots going on in his life.

363
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,928
His dad was a violent alcoholic.

364
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,266
Maybe Kato is too.

365
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,385
He's not the type.

366
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,601
How do you know?

367
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,938
He's the kindest person I know.

368
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:29,072
If only I'd met him earlier...

369
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,501
Would you have lived?

370
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,969
Whatever.

371
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,264
I'm sorry.

372
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,646
I'll turn off the light.

373
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,181
"Masaru Kato, caretaker"

374
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,621
Brother!

375
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,130
Hey, bro.

376
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,053
Aren't you going to bed?

377
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,509
I will, soon.

378
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,808
Trouble sleeping again?
Bad dreams?

379
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,902
Off to bed, Ayumu.

380
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,442
Wake up on time
if you want to eat.

381
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,601
Not again.

382
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,593
Rise and shine,
it's a new morning for us

383
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:18,510
A morning of new hope

384
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,430
Breathe in, a chest full of joy

385
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:26,351
Look up at the clear, blue sky!

386
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:28,941
Listen to the radio

387
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,525
Is this everyone?

388
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:34,146
The summer breeze
is so wholesome

389
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:38,071
Breathe in and exercise now

390
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:41,913
To the count of one, two and three!

391
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,503
"All of your old lives are gone."

392
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,253
"I will decide how to
use your new lives."

393
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,718
"That's the way the cookie crumbles."

394
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:05,344
"You will all please go now
to finish off this guy."

395
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
"Tanaka Alien,
he's as bright as sunshine."
"He loves boom boxes."

396
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,869
You understand now?

397
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:35,208
Gantz scanned us.
It knows everything about us.

398
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,256
There's no escape.

399
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,798
You'll be called back every time.

400
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:45,051
Every time...

401
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,266
To get ourselves almost killed?

402
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:50,981
Right.

403
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:55,273
Gantz was recruiting people
long before me.

404
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:58,944
They fought the aliens
and were replaced when they died.

405
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,318
Many of them died.

406
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,576
And I survived.

407
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,495
You could have told us that!

408
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:19,176
If we knew, those others
might still be alive!

409
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:24,757
You understand nothing, hypocrite!

410
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,093
You used them as bait.

411
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,804
Correct answer!

412
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,307
I knew you and I were alike.

413
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:34,228
What?

414
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:38,604
Aliens lose focus
when they are killing humans.

415
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,824
Isn't that funny?

416
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,615
Tell us what you know!

417
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:49,286
Tell us what we should do
to survive.

418
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:55,664
Don't depend on me.
How about using your brain?

419
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,679
This suit...

420
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:09,431
Put it on.
It should be of some help.

421
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,349
Off I go.

422
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:13,726
Good luck!

423
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,025
Grandma!

424
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:20,362
Do I have to do this again?
How many times?

425
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:21,856
I don't know.

426
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,607
Put the suit on!

427
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,200
The attaché case.

428
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:27,986
Here.

429
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,540
"go now, please."

430
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:47,215
Where are you, Grandma?

431
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:51,344
Grandma!

432
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:55,022
Ryo!

433
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,062
Ryo!

434
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:03,360
Grandma, where are you?

435
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,277
Ryo!

436
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,869
Ryo!

437
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,243
Ryo!

438
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,952
Grandma!

439
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,757
Ryo!

440
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:29,427
Grandma!

441
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:35,729
Ryo, don't worry.
Grandma's with you.

442
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,359
You'll be all right.

443
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,608
Grandma will protect you.

444
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,161
Is that it?

445
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,042
Kurono...?

446
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:02,705
He's in trouble!

447
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,560
The suit's dead!

448
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,846
Help, now!

449
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,812
Kato?

450
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,193
Kato!

451
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,149
Oh, my God...

452
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,136
Can you hear me?

453
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,721
You'll be OK.

454
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,939
Get 100 points.

455
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:52,649
What will happen
when I get 100 points?

456
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,866
With 100 points...

457
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,494
you can resurrect me.

458
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

459
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:07,681
Kato!

460
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,201
You're in the way!

461
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:32,578
I can't move!

462
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,194
Go away!

463
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,203
Go away!

464
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:40,270
Me?

465
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,165
Hold it!

466
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,479
That hurts, damn it!

467
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:02,064
Kei.

468
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Sorry, I was quicker.

469
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,777
Kei.

470
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:53,779
Kei!

471
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:13,825
Kei?

472
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:16,528
Where's Kei?

473
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,166
What's happened to Kei?

474
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:24,161
What's happened to Kei?

475
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,837
What's going on?

476
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,232
You made it.

477
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,583
Am I alive?

478
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,976
"It's time for the score."

479
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:31,189
"0 points for Kishimoto,
stop staring at Kato."

480
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:36,157
"0 Points for Kato,
stop being stared at."

481
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:39,778
What is it evaluating anyway?

482
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,739
"0 points for Suzuki,
where were you?"

483
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,663
"0 points for Shiraishi,
I saw you."

484
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,623
"7 points for Kurono,
making it 7 in total."

485
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,708
7 points.

486
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,506
Wow.

487
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:59,135
“93 points to go."

488
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,286
Get 100 points.

489
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,176
Gantz...

490
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,685
what happens when I get 100 points?

491
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:56,563
"Choose from the 100-point menu"

492
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:04,120
"100-point menu"

493
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:08,743
"1.Wipe your memory and be released.
2.Resurrect any player you like."

494
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:12,374
Released...

495
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:15,419
Dead ones can be brought back to life?

496
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:44,861
Huh?

497
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:57,047
It's real.

498
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,103
Hello.

499
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,568
Oh, you answered!

500
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,397
It's me Tae Kojima, from college.

501
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:31,494
I've never called you before!
Where are you now?

502
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:36,366
Uh...you know...

503
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:41,412
Do you read comic books, Kurono?

504
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,539
Sure.

505
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,587
Do you like reading them?

506
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,762
I guess so.

507
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:54,346
Don't laugh when I tell you this...

508
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:59,769
but...I draw comics.

509
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:03,775
What kind?

510
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,662
So? What do you think?

511
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,003
Awesome.

512
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:31,843
I know girls' comics don't usually
have male heroes!

513
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:36,968
I chose an ordinary guy like you
to fight evil.

514
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,312
It's like me when I was a kid.

515
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:41,601
Oh?

516
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,945
It reminds me of my childhood.

517
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:54,573
I used to protect my friend
from bullies.

518
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,496
Oh, did you?

519
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:58,614
Yes.

520
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:03,829
I bumped into him the other day.

521
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:11,339
I bet he doesn't remember me
protecting him.

522
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:16,883
You know...

523
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,683
it's a hero's duty to fight evil.

524
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,359
Anybody who's scared can run.

525
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,481
I'll protect them all.

526
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:58,679
Here's your coat.

527
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,186
You met my brother?

528
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:12,104
Yes, but I didn't talk to him.

529
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:17,527
I didn't know how to explain
our situation.

530
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,744
Kato...

531
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:31,549
what's going on in that room?

532
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:36,466
Are we dead?

533
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:39,757
Or are we alive?

534
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:48,062
When I woke up in the room

535
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,443
I thought I'd finally died.

536
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:55,106
For a while...

537
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:58,776
death seemed a good option.

538
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:06,413
But now I want to live.

539
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,922
Because I met you, Kato.

540
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:19,263
So you saved me.

541
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:24,343
- That's why...
- I...

542
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:27,430
I was in juvenile detention.

543
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:36,613
I killed my own father.

544
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:43,863
My father...

545
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:47,621
He was drunk every day
and beat my brother.

546
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,536
I wanted to save him...

547
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,330
but I failed.

548
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,134
I couldn't be there for him.

549
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:06,307
I always want to be around
to protect my brother.

550
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:15,194
Sorry, I got carried away.

551
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,567
Let me walk you home.

552
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:47,434
There was a fire early this morning
at a Shinagawa parking complex.

553
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:51,476
It's thought that leaking petrol
caught fire,

554
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:55,067
but the details are still
under investigation.

555
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:58,187
Similar cases of destruction

556
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:01,782
have been reported in Tama City
and other suburbs.

557
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:04,368
The police suspect a connection...

558
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,755
You look tired.
Why don't you take a day off?

559
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:19,462
Maybe I should get a job, too.

560
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:23,053
Don't be silly,
you should be studying.

561
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,097
Something's bothering you.

562
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,058
There's nothing.

563
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:41,272
OK, I've been having
nightmares recently...

564
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:45,109
with lots of people dying.

565
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,741
They all get killed,

566
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,077
but I can't do anything to help them.

567
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,745
I can't save any of them.

568
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:04,253
Lucky it's just a dream.

569
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,132
You're right.

570
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,058
Speaking of dreams,

571
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,182
I had a dream recently
that you disappeared.

572
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:21,483
But I'd be OK. You're the one
who'd be in trouble.

573
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,446
You can't cook.

574
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:28,326
Ayumu.

575
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:33,241
I won't go anywhere.
I won't disappear.

576
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:35,618
I know you won't.
Give it here.

577
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:56,096
I believe

578
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,809
that each of us has a role in life.

579
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:04,480
We all have something
unique to offer.

580
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:08,485
And there's a place where
we can maximize our abilities.

581
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,614
Here it comes!

582
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:15,491
Here I go!

583
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,539
Ayumu.

584
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,383
I will come back for you.

585
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,624
Is it happening again?

586
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,912
Yes.

587
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:13,090
Listen to me carefully.

588
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:17,344
This is where the selection is made.

589
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:20,731
Will you go to heaven?

590
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:25,771
Or will you burn in hell
for infinity?

591
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:32,619
Merciful Buddha watches us
and decides our destiny.

592
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:36,329
"Ill-tempered Alien. He's enormous
and likes peace and quiet."

593
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:38,289
You aren't dead yet.

594
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,751
Join our fight so we all survive.

595
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,622
I'll tell you what I know.

596
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:47,963
First put on the suit
that's in the case.

597
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:50,840
We've already experienced this.

598
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:53,760
You're going to have to fight,
like it or not.

599
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,302
Shut up!

600
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,931
Don't be tempted by his words!

601
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:04,274
The Lord says this man
is the devil's advocate.

602
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:08,316
You have to trust me
in order to survive!

603
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:11,532
Put the suit on now!

604
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,700
Kato.

605
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:17,988
Don't waste your time!
Newcomers won't get it.

606
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:20,207
Don't you want to help them?

607
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:21,416
Yes, so I'll go alone.

608
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,831
You'll die like the kid!

609
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:26,046
I'm different from him.

610
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:32,254
Don't worry. I'll protect you, too.

611
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:35,677
I just don't want
to see any more deaths!

612
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:38,850
Kato.

613
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:42,851
Are you serious?

614
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:47,522
Maybe you just want
to get out of here.

615
01:25:48,352 --> 01:25:49,353
No!

616
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,528
I know you.

617
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:56,986
You're a hypocrite.

618
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,612
That's not true!

619
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:01,998
This isn't something
for a guy from juvie.

620
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:09,339
Come on.

621
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,877
Let me go.

622
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,260
Kato.

623
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:22,932
There's no time for this.

624
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,022
No way...

625
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:40,659
Where is Hitomi?
She was with me a minute ago.

626
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:45,959
You want to put the suit on?

627
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:49,546
You can trust that guy.

628
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:30,378
This is cool.

629
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,213
We're in Ueno Park.

630
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:33,957
It's so realistic.

631
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:33,525
That's it.

632
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:57,507
That's the one we saw on the orb.

633
01:28:57,624 --> 01:28:59,001
It's our target?

634
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:07,926
Listen very carefully.

635
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:14,225
Something unbelievable and horrifying
is about to happen.

636
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:17,899
If we cooperate, we can all survive.

637
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the hell?

638
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:48,308
Run!

639
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:50,306
Run!

640
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:52,395
Come on!

641
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:26,292
Surround him and shoot!

642
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:31,383
Kei, out of the way!

643
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:33,472
This sucker is mine.

644
01:32:41,431 --> 01:32:42,933
Damn!

645
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:49,902
Kei, step aside!

646
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:26,143
Help everyone evacuate!

647
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,144
- But Kei...!
- I'll finish him off!

648
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:29,270
You can't!

649
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:52,961
I've got him!

650
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:54,846
Out of my way!

651
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,069
I nailed it, didn't I?

652
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:55,732
That was not good.

653
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:59,782
- We lost our guy.
- That one's your fault.

654
01:35:03,907 --> 01:35:07,832
Next time make sure
everyone evacuates.

655
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,920
I'll take care of the bad guy.

656
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:18,634
How come we're not returning?

657
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:51,879
It hurts.

658
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:03,970
Is she dead?

659
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,478
There's another one.

660
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:03,928
Kurono, behind you!

661
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Thousand-Armed Buddha...

662
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:04,655
Shit!

663
01:39:07,733 --> 01:39:08,905
I'll go.

664
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:12,534
You'll get killed!

665
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:15,249
- You're hurt.
- I can do it.

666
01:39:16,826 --> 01:39:20,956
It's just like when we were kids.

667
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:28,964
You were my hero.
I always wanted to be like you.

668
01:39:29,839 --> 01:39:31,182
But...

669
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:36,896
..you're right, Kei.

670
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:41,189
Maybe I do just want
to get out of this place.

671
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:46,068
I'm just a hypocrite.

672
01:39:48,858 --> 01:39:51,156
Look after Kei for me.

673
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,366
Kato!

674
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

675
01:40:56,884 --> 01:41:00,730
You attacked us first.

676
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You killed my friends.

677
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,578
I will avenge their deaths.

678
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:33,838
Go, Kato, now!

679
01:43:34,667 --> 01:43:36,135
Kato.

680
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:41,807
You have Ayumu.

681
01:43:43,592 --> 01:43:45,185
Go back to him.

682
01:45:04,507 --> 01:45:05,599
Kato!

683
01:45:48,884 --> 01:45:50,227
Kato...

684
01:45:55,015 --> 01:45:56,938
I will avenge their deaths.

685
01:45:57,059 --> 01:45:58,857
You will die.

686
01:45:58,978 --> 01:46:01,276
Your people will die.

687
01:46:01,397 --> 01:46:03,570
I will destroy everything.

688
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:31,277
Kei!

689
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:33,863
Kato!

690
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:00,932
I can do this.

691
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:04,602
I know I can.

692
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:19,113
Kei...

693
01:51:07,744 --> 01:51:09,337
Oh, my God.

694
01:51:27,264 --> 01:51:28,356
Kato.

695
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:29,934
Kato.

696
01:51:31,518 --> 01:51:32,895
Kato.

697
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:38,363
Kato, it's finished.

698
01:51:38,942 --> 01:51:42,537
I knew you'd be the hero.

699
01:51:47,075 --> 01:51:48,122
Kato.

700
01:51:50,746 --> 01:51:56,048
Pull yourself together.
We're going back now.

701
01:51:58,253 --> 01:51:59,971
Thank you, Kei.

702
01:52:02,257 --> 01:52:03,975
I can go back to Ayumu...

703
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:06,971
I can...

704
01:52:08,472 --> 01:52:09,724
Kato...

705
01:52:11,934 --> 01:52:15,984
Hey, Gantz, hurry up!

706
01:52:24,279 --> 01:52:28,580
Kato, don't die on me!

707
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,828
I'll be waiting for you!

708
01:53:06,071 --> 01:53:09,541
"It is time for the scores."

709
01:53:11,243 --> 01:53:14,497
Hold on a minute...

710
01:53:15,122 --> 01:53:17,170
Kato's not here yet.

711
01:53:18,417 --> 01:53:21,421
"13 points for Kurono,
getting a total of 20."

712
01:53:21,545 --> 01:53:23,547
"80 points to go."

713
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:28,886
Gantz...

714
01:53:31,054 --> 01:53:32,852
Show me the casualties.

715
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:09,931
Give him back!

716
01:54:12,596 --> 01:54:15,224
Give Kato back to me!

717
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:19,023
"100-point menu"

718
01:54:19,144 --> 01:54:24,947
"1.Wipe your memory and be released.
2.Resurrect any player you like."

719
01:54:31,907 --> 01:54:34,786
I have to keep fighting
to resurrect him?

720
01:54:40,457 --> 01:54:43,927
You want me to fight
until I get 100 points?

721
01:54:52,636 --> 01:54:55,480
That's insane.

722
01:55:59,703 --> 01:56:00,875
Hi.

723
01:56:03,457 --> 01:56:06,256
I drew the next part of the story.

724
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:23,690
Sorry, not today.

725
01:56:25,228 --> 01:56:28,983
I'm not in the mood to read it.

726
01:56:33,153 --> 01:56:35,827
Well...um...

727
01:56:37,115 --> 01:56:39,038
Did something happen?

728
01:56:42,704 --> 01:56:46,584
I showed you my comic artwork
the other day,

729
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:48,051
and...

730
01:56:48,835 --> 01:56:50,052
Kurono.

731
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:54,008
You said you liked it.

732
01:56:56,551 --> 01:57:01,682
But you were acting strangely.

733
01:57:03,183 --> 01:57:07,029
You scared me a little.

734
01:57:08,563 --> 01:57:12,943
I know when you're not yourself
because I watch you.

735
01:57:14,402 --> 01:57:17,406
I guess it sounds creepy
if I watch you...

736
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:20,083
I'm sorry.

737
01:57:20,742 --> 01:57:23,120
You must think I'm weird.

738
01:57:27,415 --> 01:57:29,793
Hey, watch out!

739
01:57:34,714 --> 01:57:36,887
My cap!

740
01:57:37,008 --> 01:57:39,807
No, the train is coming soon.

741
01:57:39,928 --> 01:57:42,101
Honey, the train's coming.

742
01:57:42,222 --> 01:57:43,974
Oh, no...

743
01:57:44,099 --> 01:57:46,648
I want my cap!

744
01:57:46,768 --> 01:57:49,237
The train's coming.

745
01:57:58,321 --> 01:57:59,914
Thank you.

746
01:58:01,283 --> 01:58:03,877
Thank the nice man, darling.

747
01:58:03,994 --> 01:58:05,587
Thank you.

748
01:58:07,581 --> 01:58:13,213
The express service will not stop
at platform 2.

749
01:58:13,336 --> 01:58:18,137
Please stand back
as the train approaches.

750
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:28,352
Kurono?

751
01:58:33,523 --> 01:58:36,493
Come on, get up from there!

752
01:58:41,156 --> 01:58:42,373
Kurono!

753
01:58:46,202 --> 01:58:47,545
Kurono!

754
01:58:50,707 --> 01:58:51,879
Don't die!

755
01:59:08,683 --> 01:59:09,855
Sorry.

756
01:59:15,523 --> 01:59:17,867
I like you.

757
01:59:17,984 --> 01:59:20,737
I like you. I care about you.

758
01:59:23,823 --> 01:59:25,325
So please...

759
01:59:27,035 --> 01:59:29,538
Please don't die.

760
02:00:20,964 --> 02:00:22,261
Brother?

761
02:00:27,554 --> 02:00:28,976
Ayumu?

762
02:00:29,097 --> 02:00:30,098
Yes?

763
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:35,312
I believe

764
02:00:36,312 --> 02:00:40,283
that each of us
has a role in life.

765
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:44,155
We all have something unique
to offer. And...

766
02:00:44,279 --> 02:00:47,954
there's a place where
we can maximize our abilities.

767
02:00:50,952 --> 02:00:56,174
Those with talents and gifts
have to make an effort.

768
02:00:56,291 --> 02:01:01,798
They're obliged to fulfil
their potential.

769
02:01:09,596 --> 02:01:12,850
I want to come back alive...

770
02:01:16,311 --> 02:01:18,313
to my girlfriend.

771
02:01:21,107 --> 02:01:22,825
If someone's waiting for you...

772
02:01:28,114 --> 02:01:30,162
We'll go home alive.

773
02:01:35,163 --> 02:01:38,838
Mind if I follow you?

774
02:01:41,294 --> 02:01:44,889
You make me believe
that I can do it.

775
02:01:56,768 --> 02:01:58,816
We are not dead.

776
02:02:01,231 --> 02:02:02,858
Get 100 points...

777
02:02:09,322 --> 02:02:11,370
and the dead ones...

778
02:02:12,742 --> 02:02:14,836
will come back to life.

779
02:02:14,953 --> 02:02:16,955
"100-point menu"

780
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:21,176
"1.Wipe your memory and be released.
2.Resurrect any player you like."

781
02:02:22,836 --> 02:02:25,760
So please trust me.

782
02:02:27,006 --> 02:02:28,599
Let's fight together.

783
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:34,435
Rise and shine,
it's a new morning for us

784
02:02:34,556 --> 02:02:38,277
A morning of new hope

785
02:02:38,393 --> 02:02:42,148
Breathe in, a chest full of joy

786
02:02:42,272 --> 02:02:46,118
Look up at the clear, blue sky!

787
02:02:46,234 --> 02:02:50,034
Listen to the radio

788
02:02:50,154 --> 02:02:53,875
The summer breeze
is so wholesome

789
02:02:53,992 --> 02:02:57,792
Breathe in and exercise now

790
02:02:57,912 --> 02:03:01,712
To the count of one, two and three!

791
02:03:03,376 --> 02:03:04,753
Let's go.

792
02:09:40,106 --> 02:09:41,483
There's a rumour

793
02:09:41,607 --> 02:09:44,451
of a black orb
in a mysterious room.

794
02:09:44,568 --> 02:09:46,070
Not everybody can go.

795
02:09:48,155 --> 02:09:49,498
Gantz is acting up.

796
02:09:49,615 --> 02:09:50,491
Out of battery?

797
02:09:50,616 --> 02:09:53,244
He's the one who killed me!

798
02:09:54,161 --> 02:09:55,413
Long time.

799
02:09:55,538 --> 02:09:56,835
Kei.

800
02:09:57,415 --> 02:09:58,507
Now

801
02:09:58,624 --> 02:09:59,716
Mystery

802
02:09:59,834 --> 02:10:01,336
Unveils

803
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:03,462
Transport me now.

804
02:10:03,587 --> 02:10:04,588
Gantz!

805
02:10:08,426 --> 02:10:09,097
The Last Alien

806
02:10:11,387 --> 02:10:12,058
The Last Target

807
02:10:15,349 --> 02:10:16,066
The Last Mission

808
02:10:21,605 --> 02:10:22,481
The Last Choice

809
02:10:23,441 --> 02:10:24,408
The Only Choice

810
02:10:31,198 --> 02:10:33,576
An Ultimate Choice to be Made

811
02:10:33,701 --> 02:10:37,547
There must be a better choice...

812
02:10:37,663 --> 02:10:39,381
Witness the Perfect Answer!
