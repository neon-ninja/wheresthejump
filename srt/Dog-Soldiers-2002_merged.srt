1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,500
You were right.

2
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,600
This is definitely better than being at work.

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,000
One thing you didn't warn us
about though -- bloody midges.

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,700
You big girl's blouse!.

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,800
Anyway, now that you've mentioned work...

6
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,500
... and seeing as I bullied you
to come here to celebrate...

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,400
Here.

8
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,700
Congratulations.

9
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,300
No knight should be without his sword.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,700
I don't know what to say.

11
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,900
What, my writer lost for words?.

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,600
It's perfect.

13
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,800
Yeah, and it's also solid silver so don't lose it!

14
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
Nice try, Private Cooper.

15
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,700
You've evaded capture for twenty-two hours...

16
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
... and forty-seven minutes.

17
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,900
Go straight to the head of the class.

18
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,000
Of course, the real trick to survival...

19
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,500
... lies not in running and hiding...

20
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,300
... but in removing your enemy's capacity
to hunt you down.

21
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,800
Here. Shoot the dog.

22
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,100
I'm sorry, sir, what?.

23
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,400
Take the weapon and use it.

24
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,800
During the seIection process,
you are under my command!

25
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,700
That's a direct order, Cooper!

26
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
You're taking the piss, right?.

27
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,200
He thinks I am pulling his Ieg. Do I Iook Iike
a sodding soldier comedian, Shitwipe?. !

28
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,100
No, sir!

29
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,200
I still won't do it.

30
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,100
You don't have a choice. Finish the job.
Shoot the dog.

31
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Shoot it!

32
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,100
No, sir!

33
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,800
What use are you to my team...

34
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,400
... if you can't even kill a dog?.

35
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,200
I didn't say I couldn't kill a dog, sir.

36
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,600
I just will not kill that dog for no reason.

37
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,800
You're binned, Cooper.

38
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,800
-I don't need a man of conscience.
-You're failing me for this?.

39
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,800
You failed yourself!

40
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,100
We're on a different level here, Cooper.

41
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,300
For that...

42
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,200
I need men of action...

43
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,000
... not deeds.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,600
No! You sick fucking bastard!

45
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,800
It's just a dog. That's all.

46
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,200
Maybe one day
when that's sunk into your thick skull...

47
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
... you'll be ready for us.

48
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,500
Until then, you live and learn.

49
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,600
Yeah, but you don't.

50
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,700
I don't do second chances, Cooper.

51
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,600
And I never forget.

52
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,700
RTU this pathetic piece of shit.

53
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,100
Send him back to his squad.

54
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,700
I want a good, clean dispersal.

55
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,500
I want a secure landing zone.

56
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,400
Go, go, go, go, go!

57
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,300
Joe, get out of the pissing chopper!

58
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,100
I'm not missing the footy for this,
it's totally bone!

59
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
I'm not going, sarge. I'm not going!

60
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
See you.

61
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,600
Cooper... I want a position and bearing.

62
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,000
-I want to be on the move in three minutes.
-On it, Sarge.

63
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,800
Spoon, Terry, you're on stag.

64
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,300
Joe, for fuck sake...

65
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,800
... get off your big, fat, Iardy arse
and make like a soldier!

66
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Right then -- time sync.

67
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
I've got zero seven-thirty coming up in...

68
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,800
... three, two, one, check.

69
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh bullocks, I don't believe this!

70
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,700
What is it now, Witherspoon?.

71
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,100
I've left my watch at the barracks, sarge.

72
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,200
You want to take a breather
every once in a while, son, you'll live longer.

73
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,700
Nice work, Spoon, you tosser.

74
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,100
Took the words right out of my mouth.

75
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,600
And you'll be taking my boot out your mouth
in a minute, Joe, you baldy twat!

76
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,200
Pissing hell!

77
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,200
Close shave,eh Joe?.

78
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Oh, this shit is totally bone!

79
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,500
The most important football match
of my life is playing tonight...

80
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,500
... and I'm stuck up the backside of beyond
without so much as...

81
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
... a six-pack or a telly!

82
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,600
Yeah, well, that's the Army for you.

83
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,000
Hey, it's England v Germany, man.

84
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,100
Full-on footy war!

85
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,800
Yeah, well, it's nothing Iike this at all then,
is it Joe?.

86
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
It's just an exercise. Hardly life or death.

87
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
Don't bet on it, Joe, you're fucking slaying me!

88
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,500
If you'd paid any attention at all
during the briefing, Kirkley...

89
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,500
... you'd know exactIy who we were up against
on this harmless little exercise, wouldn't you?.

90
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,500
-And who's that then?.
-Special Forces, you plonker!

91
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,600
Bollocks to them!

92
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,200
All right, all right.

93
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,100
Now Iisten up, I'm gonna make this quick
and to the point...

94
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,000
... because, just Iike you, all I wanna do
is get home...

95
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,200
...jump into a warm bed with a nice hot woman
and watch the footy!

96
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,800
Planning on scoring, sarge?.

97
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,900
Yeah, well, mind you don't fouI her
in the penalty box.

98
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,000
All right, button it, private parts!

99
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,100
Now, as of this moment as far as we're
concerned, we are fifty 'K' behind enemy lines.

100
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,200
Now, if we do happen to make a contact...

101
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,600
... I expect nothing Iess than
gratuitous violence from the lot of you.

102
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,900
Because we're firing blanks

103
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,100
it doesn't mean we have to be thinking...
nice thoughts.

104
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
So you remember you put the fire down, right?.

105
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,400
You get stuck in and you kick their
fucking teeth out...

106
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,900
... or I'll guarantee you, Joe, they will be having
your bollocks for breakfast, sunshine!

107
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
Hard-boiled or fried, sarge?.

108
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,600
Scrambled.

109
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,900
Here you are, Spoonie.

110
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,100
Oh, smart.

111
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,700
Because it's nice and new and shiny
doesn't mean it's worth shit.

112
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,000
Remember I want that back, son.

113
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
What about you, sarge?.

114
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Well, I'll count, won't l?.

115
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,000
Right then, Coop, what we got?.

116
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,900
We're here. The front line is here.

117
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,600
AWAC reports enemy positions here,
here and here.

118
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,600
With sweeping patroIs between
each of these forward bunkers...

119
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,800
... they'll have the whoIe sector wrapped
tighter than an Eskimo's nad-sack.

120
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,600
With one exception.

121
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Right here.

122
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,200
A river crosses the line through a gorge

123
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,400
thirty or forty feet deep...

124
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,800
... and it's certain to have a patroI on it,
but if we go at night...

125
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,700
... tread careful and

126
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,900
don't mind getting our feet wet...

127
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,300
... I reckon we can make it through.

128
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,400
What the fuck is all this about then?.

129
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,900
Oh, with my Iuck IateIy,
I need all of the help I can get.

130
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,300
I know you think it was a piss poor call,

131
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,000
you failing selection and all of that, but...

132
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,100
... I gotta say, I'm not sorry.

133
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,300
The squad wouId be a Iot worse off
without you, mate.

134
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,700
It was something I had to do, you know.

135
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,800
For myself, get it out my system.

136
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,800
Listen, the onIy peopIe who go Iooking for
trouble are Kamikazes...

137
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,500
... glory boys and full-on fucking fuckwits!

138
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,400
Take my advice son, be patient.

139
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Right then, ladies...

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,300
... pack up your troubles...

141
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,100
... put your brains in first gear and start tabbing!

142
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,100
Spoonie, you're on point.

143
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,400
Terry, Joe, tail-end Charlies.

144
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,500
Over here, Cooper, on my head.

145
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,100
You twatter!

146
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,000
I can't believe I'm missing the footy for this party!

147
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,700
Joe, if you don't shut up, I swear to God
I'm gonna fucking slot you myself!

148
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,400
-Now move!.
-Didn't say a word, sarge.

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,300
Where the hell are we now?.

150
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,400
I heard a cracking story about this place.

151
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,900
You what?.

152
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,700
PeopIe disappear out here.
Happens all the time.

153
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,700
Go on, Cooper, lad, give it some boolocks.

154
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,400
It's true.

155
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,800
Just Iast month a young coupIe were hiking
through these woods.

156
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,900
They set up camp somewhere near here.
During the night - something happened.

157
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,100
A mountain rescue team found the remains
of the camp a couple of days alter.

158
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,000
The tent was ripped to shreds
and there was blood everywhere!

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The papers said it was a monster
like The Beast of Bodmin Moor.

160
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,800
Locals claimed it was an escaped lunatic.

161
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,100
But no-one's been caught so nothing
can be proved either way.

162
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
Every year more and more peopIe
come through here...

163
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,700
... and every one in a whiIe
they don't come back.

164
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,300
No trace, no bodies -- just disappear...

165
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,100
... and never seen again.

166
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,400
Contact camp.

167
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,200
Tell them the flock is heading for the fold.

168
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,100
Broadsword to base.

169
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,400
Come on then, Bruce, what scares you?.

170
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,000
The seIf-destructive nature
of the human condition.

171
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,000
You're just taking the piss now!

172
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,200
What, you think so?.

173
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,800
What about you then, Spoon?.

174
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Castration.

175
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,400
There's no argument there. Joe?.

176
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,300
Joe, onIy one thing guaranteed
to put the shits up me.

177
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,800
A penalty shoot out.

178
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,200
-Figures.
-Terry?.

179
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,400
Watching a penalty shoot out -- with Joe.

180
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
What about you, Coop?.

181
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,700
Spiders -- And women.

182
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,000
And -- spider women.

183
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,600
I want to know what scares the sarge.

184
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,200
Piss off, man, nothing scares the sarge!

185
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh, I don't know about that.

186
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,800
Well, the thought of never seeing my wife again
scares the shit out of me!

187
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,300
That and those IittIe things
that make your skin crawl...

188
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,300
... and the hair stand up
on the back of your neck.

189
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
You mean like Spoon?.

190
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,400
No, there's one thing actually, in particular...

191
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,900
... that I'll remember till the day that I die.

192
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,500
Yeah, it was back in ninety-one,

193
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,400
just before my unit was flown out to Kuwait...

194
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,300
... to mop up the last pockets of resistance.

195
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,600
Me and this young fella called Eddie Oswald...

196
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,100
... decided to go and get a tattoo done...

197
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,400
... to commemorate our first trip into the desert.

198
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,400
Yeah, I remember Eddie.

199
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,200
He was a stocky hard case...

200
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,300
... with a broken nose and a bong eye, yeah?.

201
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,300
Yeah, that's him. Good-Iooking fella.
Big hit with the ladies.

202
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,400
Anyway, me and Eddie,
we went and had a few drinks...

203
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,800
... we had a lot of drinks...

204
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,400
... then we went down to the tattoo parIour
and I got a Deser Rat done...

205
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,100
... and Eddie being Eddie wanted something
with a bit more meaning.

206
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,900
And being a bit of a believer...

207
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,800
... he said that his soul still belonged to God...

208
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,900
... but his fIesh, well, his fIesh
was way beyond redemption...

209
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,500
... and it was up to Satan to save his skin.

210
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,300
So he got this fucking great Iaughing deviI
tattooed right on his arse.

211
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,400
Anyway, about six days Iater we were making a
regular sweep along the lraqi border...

212
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,700
... and Eddie, poor fucker,
triggered an anti-tank mine.

213
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,500
Yeah. We all saw it happen.
I mean, he was on point.

214
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,700
White blinding lightning flash and

215
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,900
a fucking deafening crack.

216
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,900
And by the time we picked ourseIves up
off the deck, Eddie was...

217
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,300
... he was gone.

218
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,000
Just bits and pieces of him.
That's all that remained.

219
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,100
This big fucking red circle. Hundred metres.

220
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,400
I'll tell you something, Iads,
it really puts things in perspective...

221
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,600
... when you have to scoop your mate up
with a shovel and

222
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,800
stick him in a bin-bag.

223
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,400
Anyway, the thing that...

224
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,400
... really did our nuts in that day was when you...

225
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,500
... came across a bit you recognised.

226
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,600
Bit of ear -- toe, a nose, a tooth.

227
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,200
But the thing that really freaked us out that day...

228
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,300
... was when Left Hand CharIie found
the bit of Eddie with the tattoo on.

229
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,000
I mean everything eIse was burnt to a crisp,
covered in claret.

230
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,700
All mushed up, pulped up.

231
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,200
Not this bit. This bit was perfect.

232
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,800
And there's OId Nick chortIing
his fucking arsehole off at us!

233
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,000
So you could say that Eddie was right...

234
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,400
... that Satan did indeed save his skin,

235
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,300
just not all of it.

236
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,700
Or you could say that Eddie was just unlucky.

237
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,800
Either way it taught me to
keep a very open mind.

238
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,500
Boom boom.

239
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,700
Anyway... Eddie Oswald.

240
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,000
-To Eddie.
-To Eddie.

241
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,900
So, anyway, this bloke walks into a pub, right...

242
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,300
... with a little dog under his arm.

243
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,800
He puts it down on the bar, goes and sits down.

244
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,200
The bartender's looking at him thinking

245
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,500
"What the fucking hell's going on here??".

246
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,800
Then he looks back at the dog and,

247
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,200
to his surprise, the dog turns round and says...

248
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,100
It's a fucking cow!

249
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,000
Fucking hell!

250
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,200
Ceasefire, Terry, ceasefire.

251
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Terry, what the hell are you doing?.
You're firing blanks, man!

252
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,000
Is everyone all right?.

253
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,200
No man, I think I've shit myself!

254
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,500
Is it dead?.

255
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,100
Oh yeah, it's dead all right.

256
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,000
-Christ, Iook at the state of it!
-Sod that, man, look at the state of Terry.

257
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,300
These aren't entry wounds --
More like teeth marks.

258
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,000
What are you saying, Cooper?.

259
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,700
What he's saying, Terry, is
it died of natural causes, mate.

260
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,700
Don't you think we should call this in, sarge?.

261
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Aye, get on the radio, Bruce.
Now there's no way I'm about
to break radio silence...
... because you Iot got spooked
by a dead flying fucking cow!

262
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,800
No, we hoId this position.
We keep it secure till the morning...

263
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,100
... then we reassess the situation.

264
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Right, I want a watch posted.

265
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Two on, four off.

266
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,800
Brucie, Spoon, you're up first.

267
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Cooper and I will reIieve you
at zero one hundred hours.

268
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,300
And in meantime - Terry sort your kit out!

269
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,100
The rest of you get your heads down.

270
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,400
Unbelievable.

271
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:22,200
Sarge...cow came in from this direction...

272
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,100
... straight off the edge.

273
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,800
Out of the frying pan on to the fire.

274
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Bleeding to death

275
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,400
it couId have wandered around for miIes
before it got here.

276
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,800
Yeah, well, it's good of it to Ieave
some breadcrumbs for us to follow, eh?.

277
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,900
-Looking for troubIe?.
-No, Cooper -- just looking.

278
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,100
Sarge, shouIdn't we just report this
when we get back?.

279
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,900
Too fucking right, Terry. But in the meantime,

280
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,800
I'm curious and it's on our way.

281
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,000
Come on, lads.

282
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Natural causes, my arse.

283
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,800
Oh, now what?.

284
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,700
Christ on a bike!

285
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,100
What the fucking hell happened here, sarge?.

286
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,800
This is getting more bone by the minute!

287
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,600
Oh, Jesus Christ. Sarge!

288
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,300
Right, lads -- get a grip.

289
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,100
We've got casualties to locate.

290
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,800
So, ditch your bergens,
salvage whatever weapons you can find...

291
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,600
... and stand to.

292
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,500
We are now up against live hostile targets.

293
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,800
So if LittIe Red Riding Hood shouId show up
with a bazooka and a bad attitude...

294
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,900
... I expect you to chin the bitch!

295
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,400
Looks Iike they got hit hard and fast.
Every magazine is full.

296
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,100
Nobody got off a single round.

297
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,700
If they lost, then where are the bodies?.

298
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,300
All right, corporal...

299
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,000
... get on the net and call in.
I want emergency airlift immediately!

300
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm on it.

301
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,200
-HoIy shit!
-Contact!

302
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,300
Help me!

303
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
Captain!

304
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,800
Ryan?. ! What happened here?.

305
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,600
Do not tell me you fucking know him?.

306
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,600
Captain Ryan. Special Ops.

307
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,100
Not the fucking dog lover?.

308
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,400
Spearhead Patrol, this is Spearhead Patrol.

309
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,200
Are you receiving?.

310
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,500
He Iooks Iike he took on Jack the Ripper
and came last!

311
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,200
I can patch him up
but he needs a medic right now!

312
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,600
This is emergency Code 64.

313
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,800
You've gotta get me out of here!
Do you understand?.

314
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,400
There was only supposed to be one!

315
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,000
We're working on it, Captain!

316
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,200
- Sarge.
- Not now, Spoon.

317
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
Are you receiving?.

318
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,400
- Shit.
- What's wrong, Bruce?.

319
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,800
I can't find a signal!

320
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,400
Didn't you check it?.

321
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Of course I checked it!
And I double checked it and it worked fine!
All right, Bruce, stay on it, see what you can do.
Terry...
... this team must have had their own coms kit.
Have a look a round, see if you can find it. Go!

322
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,600
... have a shufti round the camp,
see if you can find anything else useful.

323
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,500
- Yah, but...
- Not now, Spoon!

324
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,400
This is Spearhead Patrol. Are you receiving me?.

325
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,200
There's only supposed to be one!

326
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,200
Jesus! Charnel House is compromised to fuck!

327
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,100
-Do you copy?.
-What the hell's he doing here?.

328
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,700
All I know is he's Special Forces.

329
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,000
But if this is part of our exercise,
they're not advertising.

330
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
No cap badge, no insignia, just tags.

331
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,800
What, you mean it's some kind
of convert action?.

332
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Convert action or not,

333
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,200
they're packing all kind of weird shit!

334
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Tranquillizer darts, nets...

335
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,000
... you name it.

336
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,600
This is less like a Special Ops mission...

337
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,600
... more like a fucking safari.

338
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,200
Sarge, I found their radio.

339
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,500
-Oh shit! I don't believe it!

340
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,100
There was only supposed to be one!

341
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,300
What's he on about, sarge?.

342
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,600
Terry, get back on stag now.

343
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,800
You've got to get me out of here
before they come back!

344
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,700
Who, captain?. Who is going to come back?.

345
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,100
They tore them to pieces in front of my eyes!

346
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,800
He's off on one, sarge!

347
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,000
If we don't get him somewhere warm soon,
he's gonna die of hypothermia!

348
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,500
Stay with me, captain.

349
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,000
Ryan, stay with me!

350
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,100
Not now, Spoon!

351
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,600
I don't know if you care but in about
half an hour it's gonna be dark.

352
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,700
Does anybody copy?.

353
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,900
-Any joy?.
-Fuses are blown.

354
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,300
Can you fix it?.

355
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,700
Well, maybe it was fauIty or maybe some damp
got in the casing, but it's fried the circuits.

356
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,100
Well...

357
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,900
... it's useless, mate, bin it.

358
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,000
I also found this.

359
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,200
It was attached inside. Not part of the radio.

360
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,200
Look like a transmitter.

361
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,200
Why would they put a bug in our radio?.

362
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,900
it's the Kobayashi Maru test.

363
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,100
They've fixed it so we can't fucking win!

364
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,200
Button it, Spoon!

365
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,200
No, Terry, it's probably some joker didn't want.

366
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,400
Joe to hear the footy results.

367
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Laugh?. I nearly shat!

368
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,500
Can we scrounge anything useful?.

369
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Weapons, ammunition...

370
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,300
... couple of magnesium flares.

371
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,300
That's about it. The rest's fucked!

372
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,300
Right, Iads ditch your 80s. From here on
in the exercise is well and truly over.

373
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,600
Anyone not carrying Iive rounds
had better do so.

374
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,300
it won't make any difference.

375
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,700
-They won't die.
-Yeah, well...

376
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,600
-..this gives me better peace of mind, sir.

377
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,700
You want peace of mind...

378
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,900
... run for your Iives before they tear your Iegs
from under you!

379
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,700
Now you just shut up like a good gentleman!

380
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,700
You are scaring my lads.

381
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,000
What the fuck... !

382
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Oh Christ!

383
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,400
- Oh, Shit!
- All right, lads grab what you can...

384
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,100
... head for the tree line. We're moving. Let's go.

385
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,900
Right, I need a volunteer for rearguard action.

386
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,500
-I'll do it.
-Nice one. When we're clear, you fall back.

387
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,000
We're gonna be there to cover you.
Right, off you go!

388
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,600
Bruce -- no heroics.

389
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,100
Right, Spoonie, you're on point!

390
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Joe, help Ryan. Terry, you're up next.

391
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,500
Coop, you're with me!

392
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,300
Right, lads,

393
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,100
Iet's have it through the Iong grass!
Double time! Go!

394
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,100
Come on, sunshine, fucking shift it!

395
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,400
Come on!

396
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,200
Oh, shit!

397
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

398
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,800
Bruce. Bruce!

399
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Cooper, get out of it!

400
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
lncoming!

401
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,000
Coming up on both rear flanks!

402
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,200
- To your rear!
-Target!

403
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,400
-Coming through.
-Target!

404
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,400
Keep moving!

405
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Covering fire!
They're going for a flanking position!
They're cirling us!

406
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,300
Covering fire!

407
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Coming through!

408
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,600
Target!

409
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,900
Covering fire!

410
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,600
Reload!

411
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,000
Fucking get out!

412
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,500
Just fucking leg it!

413
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Target!

414
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,300
Lads!

415
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
On me! On me!

416
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Stop!

417
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,900
Get in!

418
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,000
-Everybody on me!
-Hurry!

419
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,900
Company, fire!

420
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,100
ln! ln! ln!

421
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,300
Safety!

422
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,200
Oh, shit!

423
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,600
Just drive!

424
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
Now!

425
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,100
I'm trying!

426
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,300
Fucking floor it!

427
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,400
Joe, stab it!

428
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,000
Try reverse.

429
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,600
Stab it, Joe!

430
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Now forward.

431
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,600
Everybody okay back there?.

432
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,600
Any more casualties?. Spoon?.

433
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
-No, I'm all right.
-What about Bruce?.

434
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,800
-Where's Bruce?.
-Bruce is gone!

435
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,500
He's gone!

436
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,900
Oh, fuck it!

437
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,500
Just hang on back there!

438
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,700
Thank you.

439
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,100
That's okay. What happened?.

440
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:54,600
What happened?. We were attacked by huge
fucking howling things! That's what!

441
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,200
You were lucky I found you.

442
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,800
I was about to give up hope.

443
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,900
You knew we were here?.

444
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,400
I heard gunfire last night.

445
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,800
I knew someone was out there.

446
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,800
If you weren't aIready in troubIe,
then you soon would be.

447
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,500
We are -- Two men are down.

448
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Both need medical attention.
We need to dress the sarge's wounds
before we can take him too far.
There's only one farm in this glen, but...

449
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,000
... the owner are friends.

450
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,300
We can take your men there.

451
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,400
Hello.

452
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,200
-Nobody home?.
-I don't know where they could be.

453
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Right.

454
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,500
Stand back.

455
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,100
Little pigs, little pigs --

456
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,000
we've come to nick your video!

457
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,100
You sit.

458
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,500
Sit. Sit.

459
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,800
You stay.

460
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,100
All clear.

461
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,200
-What the fuck happened back there, Copper?.
-I don't know, mate.

462
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,300
She might have some answers.

463
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,200
All clear upstairs.

464
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,800
Where the hell are we now?.

465
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,800
Home sweet home.

466
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,600
Set him down.

467
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,200
Spoon, get a field dressing on that wound.

468
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,900
Terry, keep an eye out front.

469
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on.
Shit!
What are you doing to me?.

470
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,800
-Is there a teIephone here?.
-What?. No.

471
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,600
Still hot, lads.

472
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,200
Wait. You can't just help yourself!

473
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,600
I'm chin-strap and I'm bloody starving.

474
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
I can't help myself.

475
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,600
It's the training, miss.
Never waste an opportunity to eat. Come on.

476
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,900
See...

477
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,600
... now look what I'm doing!

478
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,500
Get it down your necks, lads.

479
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,400
Hold it. Hold it.

480
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,500
Top grub. What is it?.

481
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,400
Don't know, (mate). Looks like pork.

482
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Yeah, well, Ieave some for us,
you greedy mongrels!

483
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,300
Miss, where is the nearest phone?.

484
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,200
Fifty miles as the crows flies.

485
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,000
What about the nearest population centre?.

486
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,700
You mean a town?.

487
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,200
Well, Fort William but it's at Ieast
four hour drive back the way we just came.

488
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,900
Do you think your wounded can make it?.

489
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,500
We have to try. The sarge is in serious troubIe
if we don't.

490
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,600
You seem to know these roads.

491
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,400
-Will you take us?.
-Right now?.

492
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,900
Well, unIess you friends have just gone
walkabout, this place may be compromised.

493
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,700
Fine. Sooner the better.

494
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,700
Let's go.

495
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,800
Right. Spoon, on me.

496
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,500
Everyone eIse, hang back
till we bring the car about.

497
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,000
Joe, help sarge.

498
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,500
Terry, watch him.

499
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,900
Safeties off.

500
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,500
Don't shoot.

501
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,200
Don't stare back.

502
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
I can't help it.

503
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Go!

504
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,600
Come on!

505
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,300
Cooper, have you gone spare or what?.

506
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,100
-Cooper, you radgie!
-That puts the kibosh on that plan!

507
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,100
That was my car!

508
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,100
Give us a fucking hand here!

509
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,900
Oh my God!

510
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,900
Fuck off!

511
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,400
Fuck that!

512
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,400
Stand back!

513
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,800
Bloody hell!

514
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,000
Go on, son!

515
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,200
What the fucking hell's happening?.

516
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Terry, right flank. Cover the window!

517
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,200
For Christ's sake, Terry, man, get a grip!

518
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
That's bloody charming, that is!

519
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,600
You incompetent moron!

520
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,300
Do you want to have a fucking go, like?. !

521
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,100
Bathroom?.

522
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,400
Upstairs. Far end of passage.

523
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,300
We need to talk, Ryan.

524
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,700
Doesn't look like I'm going anywhere, does it?. !

525
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,000
Joe, Spoon, look like we're staying.

526
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,800
You know what to do.

527
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,600
I want a secure perimeter
with a clear field of fire.

528
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,800
But give them something inviting.

529
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,100
Right?.
-I'm on it.

530
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,400
Terry, are you okay?.

531
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
-I've got a reaI craving for a kebab.
-I'll take that as a yes.
Right, we've got limited ammunition.
I want you to get as many pots
and pans as you can lay your hands on...

532
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
... fill them with water and keep them
on the boil, all right?.

533
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Terry...

534
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,900
... whiIe you're at it, stick the kettIe on.
We could all do with a brew.

535
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,400
Terry give us a hand with this.

536
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,700
Other side. Other side. Ah, you fool!

537
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
You came here because of them, right?.

538
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,500
I don't have a fucking clue what 'they' are.

539
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,000
And right now, I don't really care.

540
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,100
Then what are you doing here?.

541
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,600
This was supposed to be
a routine training exercise and that's all.

542
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,800
So this wasn't a rescue mission?.

543
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,700
No, I guess not.

544
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,300
Back door's secure.

545
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,600
What's happening here, Spoon?.

546
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,400
Well, they're still moving around our there...

547
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,700
... but they're keeping their distance,
staying within the tree line.

548
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,900
Maybe they've had enough for one night.

549
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,100
Not likely.

550
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,200
They're smart. You've seen what they can do.

551
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,000
My guess...

552
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,700
... is they're doing exactIy
what you'd be doing in their shoes.

553
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,900
They're working as a team.
Looking for a weakness, a way in.

554
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,300
I'm not about to second guess these things.

555
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,500
They're enemy, simple as that.

556
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,200
This is no ordinary enemy.

557
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,400
You know what this reminds me of?.

558
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,000
Rourke's Drift.

559
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,000
A hundred men of HarIech
making a desperate stand...

560
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,000
... against ten thousand Zulu warriors.

561
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
Outnumbered, surrounded...

562
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,100
... staring death in the face,
not flinching for a moment.

563
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,000
Balls of British steel.

564
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,400
You're bloody loving this, aren't you?.

565
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,200
It's totally bone -- That's all there is to say.

566
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,000
So, what are we talking about here, wolves?.

567
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,400
Not entirely wolf. Not all human,

568
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,500
but something in between.

569
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,000
Wolfmen?. You're having a laugh, right?.

570
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,900
I may be nuts but I'm not fruitcake!

571
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,700
Fine. Stay here and drink tea!

572
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,400
I thought you might be here because of them,
but I guess not.

573
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,000
Just don't be an arsehole!

574
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,300
I like your new girlfriend, Coop.

575
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,400
How are you feeling?.

576
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,600
A touch of gas.

577
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,900
And the fact that various body parts
are trying to vacate the premises...

578
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,400
... fucking awful!

579
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,600
- It's hot.
- Cheers.

580
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,300
Heads up!

581
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,400
For crying out loud, man!

582
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,400
Short controlled bursts!

583
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,500
Do you have a name, soldier?.

584
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
Cooper.

585
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,800
Gonna need your help here, miss.

586
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
My name is Megan.

587
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,000
And I know how to kill them.

588
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,200
Shit, sarge, you're leaking like a sieve!

589
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,400
Look, I need you to get some supergIue
and some whisky, all right?.

590
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
I'll see what I can do.

591
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,700
-Come on.
-No, no, no...

592
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,300
sorry about the arsehoIe thing.
I've got a mean streak a mile across.

593
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,200
That's all right. It's the Ieast of my worries
right now.

594
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,100
Can you pass me my gun, please?.

595
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Thank you.

596
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,800
Come on, Coop, up the wooden hill.

597
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,600
-Where are we going, Coop?.
-You don't wish to know, mate.

598
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,100
What's the glue for?.

599
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,500
Ever wondered why the best thing that

600
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,200
superglue sticks together is your fingers?.

601
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,300
-Fucking get off!
-Give it. Give it.

602
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,600
Forget your grandma's china cups...

603
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,100
... this stuff was deveIoped for the Vietnam war
to patch up broken soldiers.

604
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,000
How are you feeling, sarge?.

605
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,800
Absolutely fucking top fucking bollocks!

606
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Are you sure he shouId be
chasing painkillers with whisky?.
Yeah, well, he's earned it.
-Is it your birthday, Coop?.
-No, mate.
Is it my birthday?.

607
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,800
No, but you're gonna thank us
for this in the morning.

608
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,300
I'll tell you something, mate,

609
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,800
I'm gonna fucking thank you right now.

610
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,100
I'm gonna thank you because you saved my Iife.
You got me out of there, mate.

611
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,600
Yeah, well, you wouId have done
the same thing.

612
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,500
If I'd done the same fucking thing,

613
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,600
I would have saved Bruce -- wouldn't l?.

614
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,400
Yeah, fuck!

615
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,000
Sausages!

616
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,400
I'll tell you something, miss, right...

617
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
... this geezer here, right, is my best mate.

618
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,300
He's the salt of the fucking earth.

619
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,400
I mean, don't get me wrong, the rest of the
geezers in the squad, they're all right,

620
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,300
lovely fellas and stuff...

621
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,800
... and any single one of them could marry my...

622
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,700
... marry my sister -- if I had one.

623
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,300
I'll tell you what, I love him. I love you...

624
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,500
... like a mate that l... that I love.

625
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,700
Would you like to be alone?.

626
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,800
Oh, you -- dirty fucker!

627
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,700
Here.

628
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,500
-It's the adrenaIine.
-I'll stick, you bond.

629
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,000
I'll tell you something,
someone better get fucking stuck in soon...

630
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,400
... because this is really starting to hurt!

631
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,500
-What's up?.
-Cooper, knock me out. Hit me!

632
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,300
Oh you fucking pussy, hit me...

633
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,000
Go, go.

634
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,100
-So, how Iong have you Iived round here?.
-Two years.

635
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,800
Came here for wildlife.

636
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm a zoologist.

637
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,300
So, you've heard those stories as well then.

638
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,200
Yeah, I heard the stories, I went Iooking,
I found evidence.

639
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,800
-I was fascinated by the possibiIity that...
-You can't seriously believe in werewolves?.

640
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,600
Straight out of college, I'd have Iaughed
at the suggestion, but now...

641
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,200
... I know they're as real as you and me.

642
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,200
Before tonight is over, you will too.

643
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,900
There -- I think that will hold.

644
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,100
-You done this before?.
-Oh, yeah.

645
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,600
We gIue peopIe's gut together
all the time out here.

646
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,600
Everyone tooled up?.

647
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,100
To the nines.

648
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,100
You'll have a fucking eye out with that, lad.

649
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,400
Right, Terry, look sharp!

650
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,800
The rest of you...

651
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,700
... I know things have gone from shit to bone...

652
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,000
... to worse in the last twenty four hours, but...

653
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,000
... if we pull our weight and do the job...

654
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,300
...we still have a fighting chance.
No more running.

655
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,400
We stand, here. We fight.

656
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,900
Right?. -- Any questions?.

657
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,700
Oh, just the one, Coop.
Exactly what is it we're fighting against?.

658
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,600
Megan?. You want to run it past the boys?.

659
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,400
-Lycanthropes.
-You what?.

660
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,900
That's werewolves to you and me.

661
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,400
-You're taking the piss?.
-What?. Makes perfect sense to me!

662
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,300
What, you mean like full moons,

663
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,200
siIver bullets and eyebrows
that join in the middle?.

664
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,100
Before you dismiss it offhand,

665
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
think about what you've seen and heard.

666
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,300
The full moon, the teeth...

667
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,900
... the cIaws, the howIing.
Is it so difficult to believe?.

668
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,000
For a whole year now...

669
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,400
... I've tracked these things.

670
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,000
I've studied them. Tried to understand them.

671
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,200
Ever month, when the moon is full...

672
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,700
... they hunt as a team. Dedicated to the kill.

673
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,000
During that time, at Ieast fifteen peopIe
have vanished.

674
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,700
Hikers mostly. In small groups or alone.

675
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,200
They're caught out in the open, hunted down,

676
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,800
torn apart and devoured.

677
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,400
I've never witness the actuaI sIaughter,
but the next day...

678
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,600
... no bodies, no werewolves -- just blood.

679
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,300
The eyebrow's thing is nonsense.

680
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,600
It's just Dark Age paranoia. And silver bullets...

681
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,300
... no-one's ever get close enough to try.

682
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm sold.

683
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,400
Slow down, Spoon, but Megan may have a point.

684
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,200
I'm still not convinced

685
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
that these things didn't just escape
from the local nuthouse...

686
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,000
... and forget to shave or trim their nails.

687
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,700
But they're out there and we're in here.

688
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,000
What they may or may not be...

689
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,600
... does not affect our immediate situation
one bit.

690
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,500
This is bone.

691
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,900
This is so fucking bone!

692
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,800
Anything else?.

693
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,800
Yeah, what does bone mean?.

694
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,600
Bone - bollocks. Naff.

695
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,500
Not very good.

696
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,400
Right. Anything else I should know?.

697
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,600
Call-signs. If you need to be specific.

698
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,300
Upstairs, you've got Sergeant Wells
who you seem to know inside and out by now.

699
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,200
You've got Spoon over there.

700
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,800
The vomiting cavalier, Terry.

701
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,200
The big guy with the axe is Joe.

702
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,700
Didn't you forget someone?.

703
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,300
Ryan.

704
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,100
Captain Ryan is not one of our team.

705
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,800
His being here is hazy at best.

706
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,000
If I could tell you, I would.

707
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,600
But I'm just a soldier -- like you.

708
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,200
No stripes -- no insignia.

709
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,600
A suit in a uniform does not make a soldier.

710
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,400
He's with Special Ops.

711
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,300
His team were wiped out Iast night.
He was the only survivor.

712
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,100
I'd advise you against pursuing
this line of questioning, Private Cooper.

713
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,900
Are you pulling ranks on me now, captain?.

714
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,700
You can shove that right up your arse!

715
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,900
I'm saying my being here is a most point...

716
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,000
... since I'm now in as much shit as you are.

717
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,200
We're all in the same fucking shit.

718
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,000
And we need each other.

719
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,700
I doubt I need you.

720
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,700
You bloody did two hours ago!

721
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,500
The Uaths.

722
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,900
Crying like a baby, you were.

723
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,400
That was then. Circumstances change.

724
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,500
What?.

725
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,900
Uath - it's Celtic.

726
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,600
The family has lived in this glen for centuries.

727
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,700
So, what was he doing out there?.

728
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,600
I have an idea.

729
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,000
But I want to hear it from the horse's mouth.

730
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,000
Come to think of it, Ryan, how are you feeling?.

731
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,600
I'm fine.

732
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,200
When we found you,

733
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,800
you couId bareIy open your eyes,
let alone walk...

734
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,400
... and then later, you managed to run...

735
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,500
... and now Iook at you -
fighting fit and sitting pretty.

736
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,800
Hardly the behaviour of a man who...

737
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,800
... until recently, was knocking on death's door.

738
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,100
I have a strong constitution.

739
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,500
You're not bloody kidding!

740
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,000
Then you won't mind if I have a Iook
at that wound of yours.

741
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,000
I'd just as soon you didn't.

742
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,700
I have a responsibility to my patient.

743
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,600
I'm warning you, Cooper, don't touch me!

744
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,800
Get back!

745
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,600
Tie him up. I want him to talk.

746
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,100
-What are you gonna do, torture him?.
-Don't know.

747
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,900
-What wouId you do?.
-I'd torture him.

748
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,300
What now?. !

749
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,000
They've shut down the generator.
-Why would they do that?.

750
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,100
Because they can see in the dark.

751
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,400
And you're afraid of it.

752
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,500
This is a pile of rancid shit!

753
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,700
Now what do you believe?.

754
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,200
I'm beginning to believe you,

755
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,400
but I think Joe might have worded it better.

756
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,300
They're on the move!

757
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,400
All right this is it!

758
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,200
Mark your targets and preserve your ammo.

759
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,800
Three round bursts.

760
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,600
We've only got one stun grenade apiece...

761
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,400
... so only use them if absolutely necessary.

762
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,000
-Stand to.
-Come on then.

763
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,900
-What can I do?.
-What do you want to do?.

764
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,600
Run and hide. I know what's coming.

765
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,000
Take care of Sam.

766
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,800
Keep an eye on Ryan.
If he tries anything, pan him.

767
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,800
Chasing that first kiss, are we, Cooper?.

768
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,800
It's as simple as this.

769
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,100
If you're not there for us...

770
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,000
... we're not here for you.

771
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,100
Contact!

772
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,000
Die!

773
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,000
Spoon, get down!

774
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,000
Fucking back!

775
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,300
Fuck!

776
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,100
Fire in the hole!

777
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:09,000
Cooper!
... Hurry!

778
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,700
Cheers, mate.

779
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,300
Sarge.

780
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,500
Cooper!

781
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,300
Sarge!... Sarge!

782
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,800
Bastard!

783
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Sarge, wake up!

784
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,800
Fucking wake up, you bastard!

785
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:06,400
Sarge!
Say 'cheese', you fucker!

786
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Wake up!

787
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,400
Fuck! Sarge!

788
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:00,200
Dogs?. More like pussies!

789
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,100
You all right?.

790
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm peachy, mate.

791
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:36,500
Coop...squad's yours, mate.

792
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,000
They took Terry.

793
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,500
Then we go and get him back!

794
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,600
Too fucking right!

795
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,600
Forget about him.

796
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,200
What did you say?.

797
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,600
He's dead, Cooper, and you know it.

798
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,500
Shit!

799
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,300
Somebody must have heard some gunfire!

800
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,100
-Somebody must have heard something!
-Who?.

801
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,600
The onIy other house within fifty miIes
of here is mine. And l', not there!

802
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,100
Well, what about the road, man?. Passers-by?.

803
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,900
Do you have any idea what kind of luck you had

804
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,000
running into me out there tonight?.

805
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,700
I thought you ran into us?.

806
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,400
Joe, check upstairs.

807
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,400
Even if anyone did come by,
they would only end up...

808
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,700
... lambs for the slaughter like you.

809
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,500
Our only hope is daylight.

810
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,600
The sun rises in six hours.

811
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,200
We did the best we could.

812
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,700
But if the sarge's condition deteriorates...

813
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,400
... he'll have less than four.

814
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,700
And the only thing holding them back...

815
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,600
... is they don't know how much ammunition
we have left.

816
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Let's have a look at that.

817
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,800
Tell me. Honestly, what are our chances?.

818
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,200
Morale seems good, considering.

819
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:39,700
But that will only last

820
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,200
as long as the ammunition holds out.

821
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,400
High spirits are just no substitute
of eight hundred rounds a minute...

822
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,300
... but I don't think that's what
you wanted to hear.

823
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,100
Think about it, Cooper - up until today...

824
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,400
... you beIieve there was a Iine
between myth and reality.

825
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,500
May have been a very fine line sometimes,

826
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,400
but -- at least there was a line.

827
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,400
Those things out there are real.

828
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,700
And if they're real, what else is real?.

829
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,200
You know what lives in the shadows now.

830
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,900
You may never get another night's sIeep
as long as you live.

831
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,200
So, why worry, Cooper?.
You may not live that long.

832
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,000
Shut your mouth!

833
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,300
We are gonna make it through this.
You know why?.

834
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,600
I don't scare that easy.

835
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,200
Here.

836
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,300
It's supposed to be lucky.

837
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,000
For me, or the rest of the rabbit?.

838
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,800
-You'll need a lot more than luck this time.

839
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,700
Shut up, Ryan!

840
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,400
Listen to me, Cooper...

841
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,100
... ignore him. We can survive till sunrise.

842
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:46,600
That's all that matters.

843
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,800
-It's just a few more hours.

844
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,500
Wait a minute. Am I missing something here?.

845
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:55,900
I know him.

846
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,000
I was seconded to his team

847
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,300
during their first visit here.

848
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,200
First visit?. What first visit?.
What the fuck are you talking about?.

849
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,400
They came to check out the stories.

850
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,600
They needed an expert.

851
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,600
It's just a few more hours, Cooper.

852
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,300
That's all it is.

853
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,900
All clear?.

854
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,300
-Yeah.
-You wanna kill them all?.

855
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,000
-Yes.
-Good. Keep it up.

856
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,000
What's the damage, Spoon?.

857
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,000
Well, we might have pissed on our chips.

858
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,500
We've only got two full mags for MP5s...

859
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,800
... six rounds for the shotgun...

860
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,800
... and one spare, just in case.

861
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,200
Stay sharp, everyone.

862
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,900
We were putting fire down all over.

863
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:29,700
I mean, we filled those things with Iead and they
just kept on getting up and coming back at us.

864
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,100
Sixty rounds, man, ain't gonna last two minutes.

865
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,500
So, either we all make a break for it
and fight our way clear or...

866
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,300
... or the rest of us keep them occupied

867
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,600
while one of us goes for help.

868
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,600
And by the time the cavalry get here...

869
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,400
... they'll have to pick what's Ieft of us
from between their fucking teeth!

870
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,800
Fucking brilliant!

871
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,900
We either stay and snuff it or we all go --

872
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,400
and snuff it!

873
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,200
Decisions, decisions.

874
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,100
Laugh?.

875
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,300
-I nearIy died.
-Who's stopping you?.

876
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,300
Right, that's it!

877
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,500
We'll fucking have him!

878
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,400
Take it easy, big man. Calm down.

879
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,800
Do any of you know how to hot-wire a car?.
What?.

880
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,800
They keep an old Land Rover in the barn.

881
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,000
I don't know where the keys are...

882
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,700
... but if one of you couId break in and start it,
then...

883
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,700
I can do that.

884
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,400
-Are you sure?.
-Piece of piss!

885
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,400
Anyway, the further I am from this wanker,
the happier I'll be.

886
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,200
All right you're gonna need a decoy.

887
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,300
Something fast and loud.

888
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,700
What?. You what?.

889
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:57,000
You sit. Stay.

890
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,500
-You're serious about this werewoIf thing,
aren't you?. -I'm afraid so.

891
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:10,900
Shit.

892
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,300
Don't suppose you know who won the match.

893
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,800
Didn't even know there was a game on.

894
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,800
It's not a game.

895
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,800
Right, this is it.

896
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,900
Everyone get ready.

897
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,600
Bollocks.

898
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:34,100
Joe good luck, mate.

899
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,000
You don't get off the hook that easy.

900
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,000
All right, you bastards...

901
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:17,500
... come and have a go
if you think you're hard enough!

902
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:31,500
Well, come on, you beauties!

903
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,000
They took the bait!

904
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,600
Come on!

905
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,500
Spoon, run!

906
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,800
Move your fucking arse, soldier!

907
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,200
Come on!

908
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:06,600
I'm trying!

909
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,300
Pull us!

910
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,700
I love it when a posh bird talks dirty!

911
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,400
Jesus!

912
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,700
Fucking what's happening, Cooper?. !

913
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,900
Fucking cut it!

914
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,400
Get back!

915
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,400
Cut it!

916
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,800
-Cut it!
-Fucking thing!

917
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:39,900
Cut it!

918
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:11,800
Shit!

919
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,400
He's done it! Ryan, up!
Everyone else, downstairs.

920
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,100
-Come on, move it! Come on!
-All right, Coop!

921
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,600
Move. Move.

922
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,400
You're behind me, aren't you?.

923
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,500
I'm gonna fucking have you!

924
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,700
Come on.

925
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,300
Ready?. Go, go!

926
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,500
Back!

927
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,600
-Well?.
-She's in a bad way. Fuel pump's gone...

928
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,000
... fan beIt's buggered and she's pissing out
petrol like there's no tomorrow.

929
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,300
The word 'bone' springs to mind.

930
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,100
Joe's body?.

931
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,500
It's gone.

932
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,300
What's the damage, Spoon?.

933
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,300
We're down to forty-eight rounds.

934
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,200
Check the right.

935
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,600
Well, Ryan -- you heard the score.

936
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,200
Maybe one or two of us
are gonna make it through this...

937
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,400
... but I don't care much for our chances.

938
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:14,600
You like football?.

939
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,700
What?. "They think it's all over"...

940
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,600
... and all that crap?.

941
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,100
No, I don't.

942
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,500
Well, Joe... you remember Joe?.

943
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,900
He liked football. Fucking lived for it.

944
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,100
Is this relevant?.

945
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,700
He missed the most important match
of his life for this bullshit exercise...

946
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:31,500
... and now he's dead
along with two other mates...

947
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,600
... that I'd have readily given my right arm for!

948
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,800
Too fucking right it's relevant!

949
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,600
You just can't get past the dog, can you?.

950
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,500
We're Iosing, Ryan. We're three-niI down
and we're close to the final whistle.

951
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,500
At the very least, I want to even the score.

952
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,400
I understand your resentment.

953
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,800
But you failed

954
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,600
because you weren't prepared
to take that extra step.

955
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,000
If you'd passed, you wouId have been
on my team...

956
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:00,600
... and if you were on my team, you'd be dead.

957
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:04,200
Yeah, I failed, and I'm bloody glad of it.

958
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,900
Because given the choice of taking orders
from a toffee-nosed twat like you...

959
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,900
... and slogging it out with these guys -

960
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,300
I'll take the underdogs any time.

961
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,000
So you can take your precious seIection,
shove it up your arse...

962
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:15,600
... and stop trying to change the fucking subject!

963
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,800
Fair enough.

964
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,100
But you won't like what I have to tell you.

965
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,400
There are some places you really shouldn't go.

966
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,500
We'll be the judge of that, Ryan.

967
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,600
Ever heard of Special Weapons Division?.

968
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,400
They're the men in white coats

969
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,500
who trains doIphins
to stick mines on submarines...

970
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,500
... and cute furry animals

971
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,400
to tear your head off at the neck.

972
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:53,000
They saw an opportunity and called me in.

973
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:55,200
To do what?. Catch one of these things?.

974
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:58,100
And to bring it back - alive, if possible.

975
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,600
Only 'it' turned out to be 'them'.

976
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,300
-We underestimated enemy numbers.
-Underestimated?.

977
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I'd have a serious word with your head sheds

978
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,500
about the quality of their intelligence.

979
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:09,200
It may have been their invitation,
but it was my party.

980
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,600
I planned and executed it.

981
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,800
You mean you loused it up.

982
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,100
We lost good men, Ryan. Yours...

983
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,200
... and mine.

984
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:23,700
I wanna know...

985
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,000
... where we fit in.

986
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,500
The reality is you're expendable.

987
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,400
And I had approval to put you at risk.

988
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,500
Get to the fucking point, Ryan.

989
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,800
I made a gap in enemy lines.

990
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,200
You were good enough to spot it...

991
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
... and predictabIe enough to go for it.
That was your bait.

992
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,800
You were mine.

993
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:58,500
You bastard!

994
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
I had to choose somebody.

995
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,600
I remembered you.

996
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,500
Monkey see, monkey do.

997
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,400
They were my men!

998
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,400
Get up, you shit. You know what we can do.

999
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,400
Give us a fighting chance.

1000
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,100
Live and learn, Cooper.

1001
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:21,500
I didn't hit him that hard.

1002
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,000
You shook something loose.

1003
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,200
Bad dog.

1004
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,400
Fetch!

1005
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,400
Bag the shot!

1006
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,000
Clear!

1007
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,000
Get off!

1008
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,400
Cooper, get down!

1009
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,800
I've got target!

1010
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:42,400
WerewoIves spend most of the time
in human form, right?.

1011
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:46,200
And the onIy peopIe from miIes around
live right here.

1012
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,500
So these things aren't about
to give up the fight and go home.

1013
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,300
-They are home. -Yeah, well,
that makes perfect sense, doesn't it?.

1014
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,100
I mean, think about it -

1015
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,100
we bust into their house,

1016
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,900
we eat all their porridge
we sleep in their fucking beds.

1017
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,000
no wonder they're pissed off.

1018
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,200
But they're good people, they're kind people.

1019
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,400
-More's a pity.
-Why?.

1020
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,700
Because we're gonna have to kill them all.

1021
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:05,800
Too right, mate.

1022
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:27,800
What self-respecting werewolf would have

1023
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,200
anything silver in the house anyway?.

1024
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,600
Yeah, well, fuck the folklore

1025
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,400
It's just burn them.

1026
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,100
If we knew where to find them.

1027
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:33,900
Maybe we do.

1028
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,000
Everything we've seen so far suggests

1029
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:37,800
the behaviour of a pack.

1030
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,300
Six to eight members,
an Alpha pair leading the subordinates...

1031
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:42,600
... and a young male, a beta wolf,

1032
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,300
second in command, Makes sense.

1033
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,400
No, you lost me.

1034
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:50,600
A woIf pack sticks together.
Generally somewhere close to its food supply.

1035
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,000
Somewhere safe, sheltered --

1036
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,500
and warm.

1037
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,300
You're gonna have to move
like shit off a shovel on this one, mate.

1038
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,600
You worry about your own shit, all right?.

1039
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,700
When we bIow that fuse that pIace is gonna
go up like Zabriskie Point.

1040
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,100
-Just make it work.
-Yeah, it's easy-peasy.

1041
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,100
Yeah, lemon squeezy.

1042
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:17,000
Listen, Coop... what about the sarge?.

1043
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,000
What about the sarge?.

1044
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,400
You know what I mean.

1045
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,600
Sarge is with us.

1046
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,700
Yeah, I just didn't want him to go

1047
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,800
without getting his watch back.

1048
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,000
You -- stay out of trouble.

1049
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,400
You all right?.

1050
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine -- Cooper.

1051
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,100
I mean, I feel...

1052
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,000
... absolutely fantastic.

1053
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,200
I mean, that's the problem, isn't it --eh?.

1054
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,600
What if she's wrong?.

1055
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,400
What if they're not all in there, eh?.

1056
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,700
Then we only get some of them.

1057
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,400
It's a shit-load better than none of them...

1058
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,900
... and marked improvement on all of us.

1059
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,000
No, no, no, you listen to me.

1060
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,100
You get the fuck out now.

1061
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,600
I hoId them back, I keep them occupied
and you get out!

1062
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:43,300
We've Iost enough men for on night,
don't you think?.

1063
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,800
Let me show you something.

1064
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,100
Now do not tell me that that is fucking normal.

1065
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:01,300
What happened to Ryan is happening to me.

1066
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,400
It's just a matter of time, mate.

1067
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,200
Yeah, well, stop wasting time
with this hara-kiri crap.

1068
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,000
This fight isn't lost yet.

1069
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:11,700
With Ryan it onIy took a coupIe of hours, mate.
It's a full moon.

1070
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:16,200
I mean, I dunno, maybe it's Iike
when you need to take a piss or something.

1071
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,600
When you gotta go, you gotta fucking go.

1072
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,900
Or maybe it's more like needing a shite.

1073
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:24,000
Just because you need one doesn't mean
you drop your legs and pinch one off.

1074
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,100
Anyway, fuck Ryan.

1075
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,400
Shifty bastard couId've been
one of those things from the start.

1076
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,600
You know, Coop, there's one more thing
you gotta learn about command, mate.

1077
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,900
Sometimes the peopIe that you kill --
are your own men.

1078
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:47,800
So I'm asking you let me take care of myself.

1079
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,800
And at least spare you the...

1080
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:57,600
... unfortunate business of trying to expIain to
Annie why you had to incinerate me.

1081
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,900
We are gonna knock seven coIours of shit
out of these fuckers, we need you.

1082
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,000
It's all right, you know, mate.

1083
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:04,800
It's okay.

1084
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,700
I just didn't make it out this time, that's all.

1085
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
It goes with the job, do you know what I mean?.

1086
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:17,500
When I signed my Iife away on that dotted Iine,
I fucking meant it!

1087
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,300
I am a professional soldier!

1088
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,400
So, what do you want me to do?.

1089
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,900
Roast their bollocks off.

1090
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,300
All clear.

1091
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,100
Good luck.

1092
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,300
Light it!

1093
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,200
Shit!

1094
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,700
Sarge!

1095
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,800
I'm sorry.

1096
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:41,100
When I found you out there tonight...

1097
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,100
... I truIy beIieved you were the best chance
I had of getting out.

1098
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,200
But now we have no chance.

1099
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,800
There is no out.

1100
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,000
There never was.

1101
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,800
I came here to be at one with nature -

1102
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,500
well, I got what I wanted.

1103
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,100
Now I have to live with it.

1104
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:07,600
-There isn't a house in the next gIen.
-No.

1105
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,900
And there were no werewoIves in the barn
when I blew.

1106
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,200
Not one.

1107
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,900
And the reason you're not in the photograph
is because you took it.

1108
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,000
I never meant to...

1109
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:27,000
New woman -- same old shit.

1110
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,000
Being nice to women
will get you nowhere, Cooper.

1111
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,200
Being nice to me will get you killed.

1112
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,100
You may think they're all bitches, but...

1113
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,000
... I'm the real thing.

1114
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:52,800
Do you think I Iike being part
of this fucked up family?.

1115
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,500
Do you think I chose to run with the pack?.

1116
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:59,200
No. I chose you.

1117
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,100
But now you're out of luck, and I'm out of time.

1118
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,200
And all we can do is let nature take its course.

1119
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,200
They were always here...

1120
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,500
... I just unlocked the door.

1121
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,200
It's that time of the month.

1122
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,300
Somebody had to put it out of its misery.

1123
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:33,400
Come on, Spoon!

1124
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,400
Get clear!

1125
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,000
Spoonie, stop fucking about!

1126
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,400
Fucking shift it, that's an order!

1127
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,200
Oh, shit!

1128
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:08,800
Shit!

1129
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,700
Come on!

1130
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,200
Sarge?.

1131
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,200
Sarge?.

1132
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:41,900
I'm in the carzey.

1133
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,000
I'm in the carzey.

1134
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,600
Come on!

1135
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,600
Oh Jesus! Shit!

1136
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,800
Go on, Coop! Get stuck in, mate!

1137
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,100
Get out of it!

1138
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,500
Come on, you fucker!

1139
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,100
Come on, come on!

1140
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:29,300
-Cooper, Let's get in the wardrobe, son.
-What?.

1141
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,300
-Let's get in the wardrobe.
-Yeah, all right.

1142
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:38,600
What's that smell?.

1143
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,200
I dunno.

1144
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,400
Fucking hell!

1145
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,600
Give me your gun.

1146
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Open your mouth, watch your ears,

1147
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:56,800
mind your toes!

1148
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,600
Go! Go on!

1149
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,700
Where's Spoon?. !

1150
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,500
There is no Spoon.

1151
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:30,000
-No, you fucking bastards!
-Help me, Cooper.

1152
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:51,700
-Get in there. Get in there!
-Sam.

1153
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:55,400
What are you doing?. !

1154
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,400
-Here, take this.

1155
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,900
There's one in the chamber, mate.
I'm fucking binned!

1156
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:02,400
No, No...
We go together or we don't fucking go!

1157
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,500
That's my Iast order to you, Do not fuck about.
Do not disobey me!

1158
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,400
Come here, you fucking...

1159
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:10,000
Listen to me, you have got
to make it out alive.

1160
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,200
It happened. Prove it happened!

1161
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,300
Not just for me or my lads...

1162
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,800
... for her!

1163
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:22,600
Here...

1164
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,100
You have to prove it happened, mate.

1165
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,300
Go! Go!

1166
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:50,400
Sam.

1167
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:52,100
Fuck!

1168
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:08,900
Ryan.

1169
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,900
You tried licking your own balls yet?.

1170
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:17,700
I forgot -- you don't fucking have any.

1171
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,700
Think it's all over?.

1172
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:14,000
It is now.

1173
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1174
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
