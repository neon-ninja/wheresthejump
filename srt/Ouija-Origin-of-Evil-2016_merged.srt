2
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:46,513
Let's begin.

3
00:01:01,115 --> 00:01:02,975
Very good.

4
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,110
What was your wife's name?

5
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:12,366
- Mary.
- Mary, alright.

6
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:18,938
He seeks the spirit
of Mary Browning.

7
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:24,665
Mary, we invite you
into our circle.

8
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:32,834
Mary Browning,
we invite you into our circle.

9
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,045
- We seek you in love and light.
- Dad, don't give this woman our money.

10
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:43,210
Mary.

11
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,250
Mary, if that's you,
give us a sign.

12
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:01,426
Blow out the candles.

13
00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:11,074
Welcome, Mary.

14
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:21,682
You may ask three questions.

15
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:23,584
Why just three?

16
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:28,870
Mary, we ask that you let
the candle burn if the answer is "Yes".

17
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:31,800
Blow it out
if the answer is "No".

18
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,144
Ask your question, sir.

19
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:42,371
Marry.

20
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:48,578
Are you in pain,
anymore?

21
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:55,233
She's not

22
00:02:55,694 --> 00:02:58,683
The pain she felt
before she passed,

23
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,883
she's saying it was an illness.

24
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:04,127
- Cancer?
- Yeah.

25
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:07,315
She's restored.
She's...

26
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:11,089
She's young again, beautiful.

27
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:14,374
Beautiful forever now.

28
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:17,621
Mary, I...

29
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:22,535
Can you forgive me?
For all the things.

30
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:27,995
She says yes.
She forgives you.

31
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,524
And she ask for
your forgiveness in return.

32
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:32,820
Okay, I don't know
how are you doing...

33
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,409
Do not break the circle.

34
00:03:37,757 --> 00:03:40,759
Anyone can shake a table
with their knee.

35
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:54,769
She won't be here much longer.

36
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:57,356
Ask your last question.

37
00:04:00,836 --> 00:04:02,446
I...

38
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:04,933
I have to ask you about Jenny.

39
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,159
She's seeing this young man, Don,
and

40
00:04:07,184 --> 00:04:09,539
- they want a lot of money for me.
- Don't.

41
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:11,890
I have to mortgage the house.

42
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:15,770
It's suppose to be a terrific investment

43
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:19,251
and he says he'll marry her
if it turns out right.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Okay.
I don't know how she's doing this
but this is a scam, Dad.

45
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:46,886
Oh.

46
00:04:49,786 --> 00:04:51,750
I'm so sorry.

47
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,634
The spirit world is unpredictable.

48
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,939
She sounded angry,
so angry.

49
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,473
It's hard to explain.

50
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:01,918
Well, uh.

51
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:03,920
- Thank you for your time.
- Oh, no, no, no.

52
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:05,261
No, I can't

53
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:07,303
Just remember what
she came to say.

54
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:10,199
She's at peace and she loves you.

55
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:14,393
That's all to take away from today.
The rest is the business of the living.

56
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:19,601
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, thank you.

57
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:33,714
What was that?

58
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:36,946
You almost gave that poor man
a heart attack.

59
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:40,270
Paulina Zander, get in here.

60
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:43,954
She deserved it, Mom.
She was just trying to steal her dad's money.

61
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,570
That isn't what we do here.
It's our job to comfort them

62
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:47,804
not judge them.

63
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:49,994
It's your job
to stand at the curtains,

64
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,296
and not attack the clients.

65
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:57,534
- And you, young lady.
- I heard screaming, I got scared.

66
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:00,676
I didn't mean
to knock things down.

67
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,779
This is unacceptable.

68
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,379
That lady was unacceptable.

69
00:06:06,404 --> 00:06:07,927
She's a real bitch.

70
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:10,426
Witch.
I'm not sorry.

71
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,896
It caused us $5.

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,749
Let me see that.

73
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:20,012
He is so much weight on the table,
it was hard for me to latch on.

74
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:22,044
What's a scam?

75
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:25,887
The lady said we were a scam.

76
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:27,936
Doris, listen to me.

77
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:31,575
Scam is a lie.
We don't lie

78
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,942
We help people.
We give them closure.

79
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:35,393
We give them peace.

80
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:38,497
We...
We heal their hearts.

81
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:42,351
And that's not something that can happen
without some showmanship.

82
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:45,907
We tell them the true.
We just need to help them believe it.

83
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:47,351
Oh.

84
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:48,691
Okay.

85
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:51,033
Well, we're going to need to
spice that showmanship up a little

86
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:52,779
because it's getting kind of stale.

87
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:56,754
And if we aren't here to judge them
why did you blow out the last candle?

88
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:01,567
Well, none of us is perfect, Lina.

89
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:05,960
She really was a bitch, wasn't she?

90
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:10,792
You are Miss Lizzy Borden,
I presume.

91
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:13,224
I must say you are
not exactly what I expected.

92
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:16,715
I'm not Miss. Lizzy.
I'm Emma.

93
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:19,619
Oh, the sister.
Mm.

94
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:22,539
Well, let's see, it's been a year
since your mother and father were...

95
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:25,637
Oh, Mom.
10 more minutes.

96
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:28,996
Oh.
I'm sorry, sweetie, it's a school night.

97
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:33,205
My sister was acquitted.
And we never talk about it.

98
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,500
Of course you don't.
But the public is interested, you know.

99
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:37,569
Now, I represent the
Sacramento Record.

100
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:39,303
- You're one of those reporters?
- That's right.

101
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,665
I'm saying good night now
because I'm tired

102
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,972
and I didn't have
a very good day at school.

103
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,706
Because Terry is still
picking on my skirt.

104
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:50,141
So, please send us the money
to buy a new skirt.

105
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:53,334
Oh, and
Lina got in trouble again.

106
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:55,788
I was good though.

107
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:58,816
I love you
and I missed you everyday.

108
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:02,667
Good night, Daddy.
Amen.

109
00:08:03,354 --> 00:08:06,135
Why don't you pray anymore, Mommy?

110
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:08,684
Who says I don't pray?

111
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,802
You used to pray everyday
with Daddy and me.

112
00:08:11,827 --> 00:08:15,495
But, since he's gone,
you never do.

113
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:21,253
You're still praying to daddy?
Remember what Father Tom says.

114
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:23,616
You're suppose to pray to god.

115
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:28,311
I rather talk to Daddy,
but he never answers.

116
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:30,448
The people we helped.

117
00:08:30,473 --> 00:08:33,920
Their mommies and daddies
in heaven talked to them.

118
00:08:33,945 --> 00:08:36,791
Why doesn't Daddy talk to us?

119
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:40,691
Just because you can't hear him
doesn't mean he isn't there.

120
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:51,919
What is it?

121
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:54,083
Just saying good night.

122
00:08:54,474 --> 00:08:56,266
Good night.

123
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:29,646
Took you long enough.

124
00:09:31,543 --> 00:09:33,126
Hey, Zander.

125
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:36,072
Lina, Lina, bambino,
pour her a coffee cup.

126
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:37,910
It's a little late for caffeine.

127
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:39,806
My mom left her keys out.

128
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:41,374
Groovy.
When is she going to be back?

129
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,050
From her bridge game?
Usually after midnight

130
00:09:44,075 --> 00:09:46,873
smelling a lot like coffee
if you get me.

131
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:48,523
You want some?

132
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:54,382
(PAST DUE)

133
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:07,262
I don't think so.

134
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:09,801
I mean, why not?
We see the moon everyday.

135
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:12,131
Why can't one of us just
go on it.

136
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:13,992
There's so many things
that prevent us.

137
00:10:14,017 --> 00:10:15,337
I'm with Betty on it.

138
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:16,844
- Yeah.
- I don't see why not.

139
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:20,175
Yeah, they just put the big...
the helmets on.

140
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,181
My mom just got that.

141
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:32,794
She and her bridge club friends
play it sometimes.

142
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:35,245
Is that the board
you talk to ghost?

143
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,135
Uh, then.

144
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,154
No, thanks.
I get enough of that at home.

145
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:42,817
It's actually really scary.

146
00:10:46,002 --> 00:10:47,943
You guys want to play?

147
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,472
We could just make conversation.

148
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,945
The rules.

149
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:56,918
Never play alone.

150
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:59,277
Never play in a graveyard.

151
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:01,711
Always say good bye.

152
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:05,499
Circle once for each player.

153
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:08,314
Come on.

154
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:14,297
Come on.

155
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,401
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true,

156
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:24,617
spirits near,
we call to you.

157
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:28,704
Is there a spirit here?

158
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,799
Oh my god.

159
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:38,565
Relax, Betty.

160
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:40,743
Are you in the room with us?

161
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:45,139
Oh my god.

162
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,932
- Ellie, are you-are you doing that?
- No, I swear.

163
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,203
Ask your questions.

164
00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:55,101
What's it like
on the other side.

165
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:09,205
COLD

166
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,418
Oh my god.

167
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:13,123
Okay.
Here's how it works, alright?

168
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:16,278
We all have our hands on it
so we can't tell who moves it.

169
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:19,791
We react to the slightest pull
by helping it moves subconsciously.

170
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:20,551
Okay.

171
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:23,076
I mean, this game was designed
to make us scare ourselves.

172
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:25,781
- Yeah.
- There's nothing on the other side, believe me.

173
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:27,285
- Okay.
- You're no fun.

174
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,056
Okay. Well, if we're just
talking to ourselves then.

175
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,904
Uh, Spirit.

176
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:35,585
Will Lina come to
homecoming with me?

177
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:42,173
- Stop it, Ellie.
- It's the spirit.

178
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:43,906
Guys, this is really starting
to freak me out.

179
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,912
- There's no spirit, Betty.
- Okay.

180
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:48,277
Spirit, prove to us
that you're here.

181
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:50,874
Give us a sign.

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Yeah, you're right.
See.
Yeah, there's no spirit.
There's no spirit.

183
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:08,099
Ellie!

184
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,728
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- Get in.

185
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,241
Why do you do these things?

186
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:46,671
If you're going to ground me
just do it already.

187
00:13:46,696 --> 00:13:48,103
Because it worked so well
the last time.

188
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:51,415
- We were just playing a stupid game.
- I can smell your breath.

189
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,477
I know how hard it's been for you
and I understand how you feel.

190
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,896
But I need you
to help me, Lina.

191
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,983
For all of us.

192
00:14:02,017 --> 00:14:04,117
I'm asking, honey.

193
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:06,393
I'll try.

194
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:10,374
Really, a Ouija board?

195
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,886
It's actually pretty fun.

196
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:14,621
You should consider
adding one to the act.

197
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,718
The soil was brought back
to the Earth.

198
00:14:19,743 --> 00:14:22,598
Eight guest scientists
will join fourteen others

199
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:25,577
at the Ames Research Center
near San Francisco,

200
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:27,225
to analyze it for
evidence of life.

201
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,522
Honey, please sit with us.

202
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:31,625
Just once I want to have
a normal family breakfast.

203
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,984
Actually I'm going to be late this morning
so I'm going to walk.

204
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,599
Don't be silly, have some food.
I'll drop you off.

205
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:38,834
No, it's alright, Mom.
I'm walking with a friend.

206
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:40,126
Who?

207
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:43,700
Just a friend.
So, I got to go.

208
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:46,459
I'll get it.

209
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:48,429
No. No, Doris.
That's okay, I got it.

210
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,039
See who it is first.

211
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:52,249
It's some boy.

212
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,014
Really?

213
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:56,997
Hi, young lady,
is Lina home?

214
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,195
Yeah, she's right here.

215
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,341
Hey, ready to go?

216
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,690
Hi.
Who are you?

217
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:03,500
He's just a friend.

218
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,901
Hi, Mrs. Zander,
I'm Mikey.

219
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:13,961
- Are you ready to go?
- Not quite.

220
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:16,811
If you guys are walking to school
why don't you take your sister with you.

221
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:18,753
I can use the morning
to run some errands.

222
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:20,659
- But Mom, I have class.
- Thanks, honey.

223
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:21,937
I need my shoes.

224
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,167
Go help your sister get ready.

225
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:26,339
Come on, pipsqueak.

226
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,762
Wow, this is.
This is a beautiful home.

227
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:36,802
Mm.

228
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:40,196
Is there where you
do the seances?

229
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:44,342
Readings.
Come on in.

230
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,825
Have you ever
had your palm read.

231
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,960
Can't say I have, Mrs. Zander.

232
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:51,169
It's totally painless.

233
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,459
Mm, southpaw.
My husband was a lefty.

234
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:58,731
This is your head line.

235
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:02,160
This is your life line.
This is your heart line.

236
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:05,127
You're wearing a senior jacket,
how old are you?

237
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:06,559
I'm 17.

238
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:09,155
Lina's a sophomore, you realise.

239
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,791
Yes, ma'am.

240
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,691
What's wrong?

241
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:17,392
It's your life line.

242
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:20,016
You see how this curves here.
This could mean a few things.

243
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,706
- This is your dominant hand, right?
- Mm-hm.

244
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:25,047
I'll tell you this for sure.

245
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:28,931
If this hand or any other hand,
for that matter,

246
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:32,138
touches my daughter
in a way I don't like.

247
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:33,179
Ah.

248
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:36,206
I hate to see something happened
to your life line.

249
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:39,733
- You dig.
- Yes, ma'am.

250
00:16:42,631 --> 00:16:44,706
Now off you go.

251
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,199
Repower and economy.
You need to see the new Rambler.

252
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:46,432
The new Ramblers are in
are your local Rambler dealer.

253
00:17:46,457 --> 00:17:49,057
Dawson's Hardware, your friendly neighborhood
hardware supplier is having our annual super sale at...

254
00:17:49,082 --> 00:17:53,073
- Is it true that your mom's a witch?
- You are so weird.

255
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:57,385
- Are those cobwebs in your hair?
- Inky little witch.

256
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:02,318
Doris the dorkest.
Doris the dorkest.

257
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:04,036
That's enough.

258
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,283
Go on.

259
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:10,985
Okay, let's go.

260
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,564
You know why people
say mean things, right?

261
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:15,039
Why?

262
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:17,525
Because they're scared.

263
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:19,929
It makes me kind of
feel sorry for them.

264
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:21,920
How about you?

265
00:18:22,494 --> 00:18:25,605
Yeah, I feel bad for him.

266
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,600
Alright, off you go,
I'll be right there.

267
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:35,129
Thank you, father.

268
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:39,215
Does she have a lot of problems
with other kids?

269
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,907
Oh, she has her fair share
but it's nothing to concern at all.

270
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:48,012
She's been slow making friends
since her dad...

271
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,111
I know.
I talked about that with her.

272
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:55,799
It's very good of you.

273
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:58,977
She's a lovely girl,
it's really no trouble.

274
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:03,779
Thank you, father.

275
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,864
Maybe you could invite Father Tom
over for a reading.

276
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,462
I don't know if Father Tom
would want a reading, sweetheart.

277
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:27,503
So he can talk to his wife.

278
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:32,358
He's a priest.
They're not allowed to have wives.

279
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:36,021
He had one
before he was a priest.

280
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:40,264
She died,
just like Daddy.

281
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:01,898
Hey, what's this?

282
00:20:01,948 --> 00:20:05,168
New prop, for work

283
00:20:44,686 --> 00:20:47,861
Is there a presence here with us?

284
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,249
What is your name?

285
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,336
Marcus.

286
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:05,556
Yes.

287
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,201
No.

288
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,248
Who are you talking to, Doris?

289
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,689
Spirit, can you hear me?

290
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:17,811
Yes, we can.

291
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:20,353
And we can see you.

292
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,802
That will work.

293
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:34,691
What was that all about?

294
00:21:34,716 --> 00:21:36,376
What?

295
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:10,831
Roger.

296
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:13,358
Honey, are you there?

297
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,763
I'm here.

298
00:23:10,673 --> 00:23:12,653
Are you there?

299
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:33,068
HIFRIEND

300
00:23:33,223 --> 00:23:35,364
Hi, friend.

301
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:39,497
Now what?

302
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:10,120
Who are you?

303
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

304
00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:59,053
Cut it out, Doris.

305
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:02,339
Doris?

306
00:25:08,093 --> 00:25:09,781
Doris?

307
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:34,176
This is a little awkward
but I had to ask you

308
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:38,131
because it just seem
well, so unusual.

309
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:43,035
Have you been helping Doris
with her homework?

310
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,117
Oh god, uh.

311
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:50,517
Maybe not as much as I could,
I'm sorry.

312
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:53,509
Is she falling behind?
I can help her more.

313
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:55,662
It's nothing like that.

314
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:58,159
In fact,

315
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:03,046
unless she has learned cursive, then
somebody's been helping her quite a bit.

316
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:04,409
Um.

317
00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:06,268
No.

318
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,797
Doris, who helped you with this?

319
00:26:09,822 --> 00:26:11,739
My new friend.

320
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:14,633
Who's your new friend?

321
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,122
- I didn't do it.
- Well, I didn't.

322
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:22,379
And Doris definitely didn't.

323
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:25,496
Well, I don't know what to tell you
if... it wasn't me.

324
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:27,742
Did your sister do
your homework for you?

325
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:30,565
I told you, no.

326
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,104
Your new friend did.

327
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:38,278
I let her used my hand.

328
00:26:58,906 --> 00:27:01,754
Do you think we'll have to move?

329
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,489
I don't know, sweetie.

330
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:11,780
Dad won't like this.

331
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,656
I should tell him.

332
00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:38,587
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true,

333
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:41,251
spirits near,
we call to you.

334
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:42,947
Daddy.

335
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:46,646
Did you hear that?

336
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:50,662
We may have to
move out of our house.

337
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,762
I'm sorry, Mom.

338
00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:08,267
It's not right.

339
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,260
This was your dad's house.

340
00:28:13,914 --> 00:28:15,815
Our house.

341
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:20,929
This is where
he wanted us to live.

342
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:28,909
If there is any part of him left,
it's here.

343
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:32,569
In these walls.

344
00:28:35,699 --> 00:28:38,441
Doris doesn't really quite get it,
does she?

345
00:28:38,722 --> 00:28:40,226
No.

346
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:44,307
She thinks he just left,
like he went to work.

347
00:28:44,332 --> 00:28:47,885
It's better than getting hit by
some asshole drive and drunk.

348
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:55,250
I think,
it's best she doesn't understand.

349
00:29:05,942 --> 00:29:08,887
I wish he could watch
you girls grow up.

350
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:12,511
So he could see
the women you'll be.

351
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,687
Here you go.

352
00:29:21,939 --> 00:29:23,889
What's that, honey?

353
00:29:23,914 --> 00:29:25,956
It's for us.

354
00:29:29,689 --> 00:29:32,702
Where-Where did you find this?

355
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,829
It's over here.

356
00:29:57,216 --> 00:30:00,050
There's no more, I checked.

357
00:30:00,478 --> 00:30:03,362
They're from people
who were here before.

358
00:30:03,771 --> 00:30:06,397
How did you find out about that?

359
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:08,470
Daddy told me,

360
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:11,165
with the board.

361
00:30:14,964 --> 00:30:16,709
Come on.

362
00:30:30,904 --> 00:30:34,492
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true,

363
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:38,224
spirits near,
we call to you.

364
00:30:39,815 --> 00:30:41,512
Daddy.

365
00:30:41,878 --> 00:30:45,974
We found the money.
Thank you.

366
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:54,837
It's hard to hear him sometimes.

367
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:58,743
Like a car radio when
we go into a tunnel.

368
00:30:59,396 --> 00:31:01,498
You can hear him?

369
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:05,973
Whispers.
They are tough to make out.

370
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:09,550
But I can hear them a little better
when I'm at the board.

371
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:11,946
A lot better if I touch
the planchette.

372
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,753
Doris, this is mean.

373
00:31:13,778 --> 00:31:16,024
It's okay, Lina.

374
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:20,075
Daddy, are you here?

375
00:31:25,202 --> 00:31:26,838
Stop it.

376
00:31:28,574 --> 00:31:30,199
Okay, then.

377
00:31:31,748 --> 00:31:35,688
Roger, if this is you,

378
00:31:38,103 --> 00:31:41,229
When I told you
I was pregnant with Lina,

379
00:31:42,162 --> 00:31:44,791
where were you when I told you?

380
00:32:05,263 --> 00:32:07,388
SHOWER

381
00:32:10,426 --> 00:32:12,365
Is she right?

382
00:32:14,187 --> 00:32:16,778
He doesn't really need me.

383
00:32:17,826 --> 00:32:20,259
Isn't that right, Daddy?

384
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:34,649
What are you looking at?

385
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:39,345
Sometimes I can see them,
through this.

386
00:32:40,271 --> 00:32:43,018
But I haven't seen Daddy yet.

387
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:45,578
But I want to.

388
00:32:54,315 --> 00:32:56,236
Roger.

389
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:00,468
Are you really here?

390
00:33:25,993 --> 00:33:27,994
Look, she could've

391
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:31,016
manipulated the board in
any number of ways.

392
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:35,063
- You know that better than anyone.
- It's real.

393
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:40,884
What we've been doing here.
What we thought we where doing here.

394
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:43,461
We can truly help people.

395
00:33:43,462 --> 00:33:47,869
We can actually do what
we've been pretending to do.

396
00:33:48,674 --> 00:33:50,562
And Lina,

397
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:55,452
we can talk to Daddy again.

398
00:33:56,461 --> 00:34:00,282
But how, Mom?
It's just a stupid game.

399
00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:05,479
My mother was a fortune teller

400
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:08,081
before I was born.

401
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:11,289
Read tea leaves.

402
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,909
Tarot cards.

403
00:34:17,652 --> 00:34:19,562
I thought it was silly.

404
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:22,257
I thought she was pathetic.

405
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:28,233
I thought it was all a scam.

406
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:37,540
Maybe she was right.
Maybe it just skips generations.

407
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:44,692
I'm gonna
take this to the bank in the morning.

408
00:34:53,247 --> 00:34:56,519
I knew your father
would take care of us.

409
00:35:05,824 --> 00:35:07,506
Good night, Mom.

410
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:57,994
Yeah, I guess I'm not allow
over there anymore.

411
00:35:57,995 --> 00:36:00,533
Ellie's mom told my dad, he flipped.

412
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,621
Hell. It's not like he isn't hitting
one bottle or another

413
00:36:02,622 --> 00:36:04,059
before he comes home from work.

414
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,529
Were you serious?

415
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,124
About what?

416
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:10,126
About homecoming.

417
00:36:10,163 --> 00:36:11,729
Why?

418
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:15,219
I don't know.

419
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,807
I mean, yeah.

420
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,951
Yeah sure, I was.
We can go if you wanted to.

421
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:22,543
Or not.
It's just a dumb dance.

422
00:36:23,165 --> 00:36:24,842
I do.

423
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,420
I want to go.

424
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:30,572
Great.
Sorry uh.

425
00:36:30,995 --> 00:36:32,295
I'm just uh surprise.

426
00:36:32,296 --> 00:36:34,976
You seem too cool
for these kind of things.

427
00:36:34,977 --> 00:36:36,677
I'm not.

428
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:39,579
I'm not cool, I mean.

429
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,224
I bet you're wrong about that?

430
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,270
Mr. Russell.

431
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:55,008
Not much room for the holy ghost
is there, Mikey?

432
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,349
Three is a crowd?

433
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:01,165
Miss. Zander, could I have a word?

434
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:03,315
No offense, Father, but

435
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:06,924
I don't need to make room for
another ghost in my life right now.

436
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,471
Holy or not.

437
00:37:08,472 --> 00:37:10,761
No, it's not about that.

438
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:13,091
You're a smart young lady.

439
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:17,594
I imagine you can trust yourself
not to make bad decisions.

440
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:21,773
But boys his age,
they require discouragement.

441
00:37:21,774 --> 00:37:24,261
It makes them a better man
in the long run.

442
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:26,832
Oh.
Well, thank you.

443
00:37:26,857 --> 00:37:28,590
I guess.

444
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,366
I actually wanted to talk
to you about your sister.

445
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:34,420
It's 4 days in a roll now
that she's been absent,

446
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,332
why is that?

447
00:37:40,268 --> 00:37:42,279
It's complicated.

448
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,685
Usually when she's sick
you mother sends a note

449
00:37:45,686 --> 00:37:48,506
or she comes by
and picks up her homework.

450
00:37:48,507 --> 00:37:50,673
She's not sick.

451
00:37:53,594 --> 00:37:56,589
She and my mom
have been working.

452
00:37:58,755 --> 00:38:00,403
What do you mean?

453
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:04,838
Let's see if we can
reach your father?

454
00:38:04,873 --> 00:38:07,211
What do you want to tell him?

455
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:10,076
Um.

456
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,807
Do I make him proud?

457
00:38:14,317 --> 00:38:16,602
Is he proud of me?

458
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,002
Always.

459
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:37,902
That tickled.

460
00:38:49,683 --> 00:38:53,651
I can't thank you enough.
That was amazing.

461
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:55,347
Can I come back tomorrow?

462
00:38:55,348 --> 00:38:58,033
Of course,
it's our pleasure.

463
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

464
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:25,497
Lina.

465
00:39:27,053 --> 00:39:28,946
Lina.

466
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:33,797
My neck hurts.

467
00:39:33,798 --> 00:39:37,278
Take this.
If it get's worse we'll wake Mom up.

468
00:39:37,279 --> 00:39:40,993
It stings,
like a bee.

469
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:43,417
You will feel better in a bit.

470
00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:47,539
Good night, squirt.

471
00:40:16,478 --> 00:40:19,187
As friends we've gathered,
blah blah blah.

472
00:40:19,188 --> 00:40:21,771
What happened to my neck?

473
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:33,261
Daddy.

474
00:40:33,553 --> 00:40:35,888
It hurts.

475
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

476
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

477
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

478
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:54,377
She belongs to me now.

479
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

480
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:54,824
Mabel, Mabel, set the table,

481
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,900
Do it as fast as you are able.

482
00:43:56,925 --> 00:44:00,848
Don't forget the
SALT, PEPPER, KETCHUP, MUSTARD.

483
00:44:01,817 --> 00:44:03,698
She got the freak.

484
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:05,676
She's so weird.

485
00:44:08,572 --> 00:44:11,170
Oh.
What are you doing?

486
00:44:14,383 --> 00:44:16,368
Hey, keep an eye out.

487
00:44:32,552 --> 00:44:35,583
What are you planning on doing it?
Stop it!

488
00:44:35,584 --> 00:44:37,446
Stop it, Jack!

489
00:44:39,025 --> 00:44:43,091
Somebody!
Please help!

490
00:44:48,938 --> 00:44:50,273
- Is he okay?
- No!

491
00:44:50,298 --> 00:44:52,832
At Cape Canaveral,
another probe into space.

492
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,193
Target: The Moon.
A 52 ton...

493
00:44:55,218 --> 00:44:58,165
Lina, call the restaurant
if you need anything.

494
00:44:58,627 --> 00:44:59,695
Mom.

495
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,886
What?

496
00:45:00,887 --> 00:45:03,098
No, you just look...

497
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,951
What?

498
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:08,326
Nothing.
Nothing, you just look nice.

499
00:45:08,327 --> 00:45:10,343
I'll be a few hours, tops.

500
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:12,957
In bed by nine.
And you have the number for the restaurant

501
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:15,240
- ...if you need anything.
- I know.

502
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:16,243
Homework.

503
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:18,977
I know.
Go.

504
00:45:40,977 --> 00:45:42,213
I'm sorry I'm late.

505
00:45:42,238 --> 00:45:43,776
Oh, no.
Not at all, please.

506
00:45:43,777 --> 00:45:45,815
This is lovely.

507
00:45:45,816 --> 00:45:49,276
I've been by here so many times
but I've never come inside.

508
00:45:49,277 --> 00:45:52,285
Well, I thought you could use
a night away from cooking.

509
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:54,207
You're absolutely right.
Some night times I'm so frazzled

510
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:57,008
I didn't even bother
to heat up the spaghettiOs.

511
00:45:57,426 --> 00:46:00,574
Oh god, please forget that.

512
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:02,949
I'm really not a bad mother.

513
00:46:02,972 --> 00:46:03,975
Oh.

514
00:46:03,976 --> 00:46:07,304
I have cold spaghettiOs twice a week.
Twice a week at least.

515
00:46:07,305 --> 00:46:09,634
I keep a case at the rectory.

516
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:13,109
Actually I invited you here
because I wanted to discuss

517
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:17,032
the girls at home,
out of their earshot.

518
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:20,911
I won't have it, Lizzie.

519
00:46:21,538 --> 00:46:23,304
I'll die first.

520
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:25,958
- Hey, come on in.
- Hey.

521
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,575
But I don't have to die, do I?

522
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,544
Oh.
Hello, kiddo.

523
00:46:29,545 --> 00:46:31,708
Hey, thanks for...

524
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,943
Well, I have some
records up in my room

525
00:46:33,944 --> 00:46:35,358
and she's just going to watch TV

526
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,864
so we should go...
upstairs.

527
00:46:39,937 --> 00:46:42,392
I do what I have to do.

528
00:46:43,715 --> 00:46:46,057
The rest takes care of itself.

529
00:46:46,082 --> 00:46:48,689
If you tell Mom he was here,
I promise you I'm going to melt

530
00:46:48,714 --> 00:46:50,093
each and every single one
of your dolls

531
00:46:50,094 --> 00:46:53,589
until they are just a giant blob
of hair and arms, do you understand?

532
00:46:53,614 --> 00:46:57,740
- As soon as I saw the axe, I knew.
- Wait, Emma.

533
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:00,199
I'm not an expert
on the occult.

534
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,810
I'm not either
to be honest.

535
00:47:02,811 --> 00:47:05,286
The spirit world is dangerous.

536
00:47:05,287 --> 00:47:08,603
The thing is...
what we do for people.

537
00:47:08,604 --> 00:47:11,987
It's not dangerous.
It's good, father.

538
00:47:11,988 --> 00:47:14,333
It's good work.

539
00:47:15,743 --> 00:47:18,253
I wish you would
let me show you.

540
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:21,154
Let me help you
talk to your wife.

541
00:47:24,173 --> 00:47:26,681
I'm sorry, I'm just...

542
00:47:27,021 --> 00:47:30,504
I assumed,
you want to.

543
00:47:30,505 --> 00:47:32,954
Who says I don't want to?

544
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:36,420
I didn't have a chance
to tell her all the things

545
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:38,780
I wanted to tell her
before she passed away.

546
00:47:38,781 --> 00:47:41,359
Mm, we never do.

547
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:43,276
But...

548
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:48,878
I've always felt that anything
I didn't say,

549
00:47:50,302 --> 00:47:52,675
she already knows.

550
00:47:57,224 --> 00:48:00,655
Gloria and I, we used to
come here once a month.

551
00:48:00,656 --> 00:48:03,703
Roger always ordered wine
with a French accent.

552
00:48:03,704 --> 00:48:07,019
It was...
so bad.

553
00:48:11,575 --> 00:48:15,699
It felt like those days
were over for me, so...

554
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:19,499
I felt that they were, after.

555
00:48:21,152 --> 00:48:22,487
Well.

556
00:48:22,488 --> 00:48:24,743
I guess I kind of
make sure of that, didn't I?

557
00:48:24,744 --> 00:48:27,320
Well, they were over
before the seminary.

558
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,576
I didn't think this through.

559
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,837
Maybe in another life.

560
00:48:40,055 --> 00:48:42,529
Here's to another life then.

561
00:48:52,694 --> 00:48:56,169
You know, it's... It's awesome
you don't have to move.

562
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,887
Such a great house.
It's...

563
00:48:58,888 --> 00:49:01,601
It's classic
It's great bones.

564
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:03,272
Uh.

565
00:49:03,768 --> 00:49:07,713
Sorry, my...
My dad's an architect.

566
00:49:08,097 --> 00:49:09,930
His idea of a good time is

567
00:49:09,955 --> 00:49:12,825
driving me and my brother
around and looking at houses.

568
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:14,946
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

569
00:49:17,844 --> 00:49:20,429
Yeah, I'm really glad
you're not moving.

570
00:49:22,807 --> 00:49:25,813
My mom is going
to be home soon.

571
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:29,157
I thought you said another hour.

572
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,933
I'm not taking any chances.

573
00:49:33,945 --> 00:49:37,561
She will seriously kill you
and me.

574
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:40,150
Romeo and Juliet.

575
00:49:40,175 --> 00:49:44,051
More like Bonnie and Clyde,
sadly for us.

576
00:49:48,479 --> 00:49:50,029
Well.

577
00:50:12,786 --> 00:50:14,428
Good night.

578
00:50:15,986 --> 00:50:17,630
Good night.

579
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:37,464
Hey, kiddo.

580
00:50:45,362 --> 00:50:48,334
Christ.
You scared the crap out of me.

581
00:50:48,335 --> 00:50:50,702
Want to hear something cool?

582
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:52,488
Sure.

583
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:56,021
Do you know what it feels like
to be strangled to death?

584
00:50:57,667 --> 00:51:01,050
First, you feel the pressure
in your throat.

585
00:51:01,273 --> 00:51:03,268
Your eyes water.

586
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:06,283
And you start to taste something

587
00:51:06,284 --> 00:51:10,665
very, very sour in your mouth.

588
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:16,807
Then it's like someone lights a match,
right in the middle of your chest.

589
00:51:16,808 --> 00:51:19,402
And that fire grows.

590
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:23,912
It fills your lungs
and your throat.

591
00:51:23,953 --> 00:51:26,554
And all the way
behind your eyes.

592
00:51:26,882 --> 00:51:31,142
And finally,
that fire turns to ice.

593
00:51:31,143 --> 00:51:36,222
Like pins and needles of ice,
they're sticking into your fingers,

594
00:51:36,223 --> 00:51:40,055
your toes,
your arms.

595
00:51:40,478 --> 00:51:44,681
You see stars
then darkness.

596
00:51:44,682 --> 00:51:47,383
And the last thing you feel

597
00:51:47,384 --> 00:51:49,351
...is cold.

598
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,798
Good night, Romeo.

599
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,053
What the hell
did you do this for?

600
00:53:04,951 --> 00:53:06,137
I didn't.

601
00:53:06,138 --> 00:53:08,246
Dad gave me this
and you know that.

602
00:53:08,247 --> 00:53:10,504
I didn't do it.

603
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:13,991
Daddy did,
to stop the voices.

604
00:53:13,992 --> 00:53:17,258
You stop this, Doris.
This isn't funny anymore, you stop it.

605
00:53:17,259 --> 00:53:18,777
What?

606
00:53:18,819 --> 00:53:20,400
What is all the yelling?

607
00:53:20,401 --> 00:53:22,536
Look what she did.

608
00:53:25,241 --> 00:53:26,637
Did you do this?

609
00:53:26,638 --> 00:53:29,840
No.
She's lying.

610
00:53:29,841 --> 00:53:31,843
Something is wrong with her.

611
00:53:31,844 --> 00:53:34,721
- You're either too stupid or too stubborn to see it.
- You watch your tongue, young lady.

612
00:53:34,722 --> 00:53:37,443
You two can live in this
fantasy world all you want

613
00:53:37,444 --> 00:53:39,372
but you can leave me
out of it.

614
00:53:39,397 --> 00:53:42,279
And You know what?
You can leave Dad out of it too.

615
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:51,008
You can't talk to me that way.

616
00:53:51,912 --> 00:53:53,887
I don't know how else
to make you hear me.

617
00:53:53,888 --> 00:53:56,957
Your sister, she's been through
just as much as you have.

618
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:59,583
- She's dealing the same thing that you're dealing with.
- Something is wrong with Doris!

619
00:53:59,608 --> 00:54:02,344
She is experiencing
something amazing.

620
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:04,217
So am I!

621
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:06,661
I wish you would join us.
It can help you heal.

622
00:54:06,662 --> 00:54:08,293
Have you listen to
what she is saying

623
00:54:08,294 --> 00:54:10,490
with that stupid board
is actually saying?

624
00:54:10,491 --> 00:54:12,743
- Yes, everyday.
- Basic things.

625
00:54:12,744 --> 00:54:15,560
"Forgiveness", "I'm so proud of you",
"I missed you."

626
00:54:15,561 --> 00:54:17,380
Things that you used to
tell your clients

627
00:54:17,381 --> 00:54:19,453
because you knew they
would want to believe it.

628
00:54:19,454 --> 00:54:21,486
You know how that works,
you taught me.

629
00:54:21,487 --> 00:54:23,696
No.
She knows things.

630
00:54:23,697 --> 00:54:27,893
I asked her specific questions,
you heard me.

631
00:54:27,894 --> 00:54:30,694
Things only he could know.

632
00:54:30,695 --> 00:54:33,294
How do you explain that?

633
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,677
I can't.

634
00:54:41,697 --> 00:54:43,257
I'm sorry.

635
00:54:43,258 --> 00:54:46,470
I know this is hard to accept, honey,
but...

636
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:50,722
something is happening here
that we can't understand.

637
00:54:50,723 --> 00:54:53,281
It's changing Doris.

638
00:54:53,282 --> 00:54:57,735
It's changing her and I know
you see that at least a little.

639
00:54:57,736 --> 00:55:01,412
If it was Dad,
if it really was him,

640
00:55:02,324 --> 00:55:03,824
then why would he change her?

641
00:55:03,825 --> 00:55:07,283
Why would he ever do
anything to change her?

642
00:55:21,682 --> 00:55:23,344
We're going to be late.

643
00:55:23,345 --> 00:55:25,212
I don't want to go to school.

644
00:55:25,213 --> 00:55:27,120
I know, honey,
but we've missed too much.

645
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:28,632
Did you do your homework?

646
00:55:28,633 --> 00:55:30,505
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

647
00:55:30,506 --> 00:55:32,722
I DON'T WANT TO GO!

648
00:55:35,913 --> 00:55:38,999
Lina, will you get your sister's things
out of her room?

649
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,068
No.
I don't want to go.

650
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:45,507
I want to stay here
and talk to my friends.

651
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:21,948
Lina, come in.

652
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:24,258
Father.

653
00:56:24,764 --> 00:56:26,786
What can I do for you?

654
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:32,824
I don't know how
to ask you this, but...

655
00:56:33,862 --> 00:56:37,480
Is there anyone at the school
who speaks Polish?

656
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,990
I'm not sure.
Why?

657
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:46,444
I found these at my house
and...

658
00:56:47,831 --> 00:56:50,001
I just want to know
what they say.

659
00:56:50,026 --> 00:56:52,807
I think they maybe in Polish,
but...

660
00:56:54,771 --> 00:56:56,801
Doris wrote them.

661
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,631
- I'm not sure I understand...
- I saw her.

662
00:57:04,436 --> 00:57:10,197
I believe Sister Hannah came here
from Poland during the war. I can...

663
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,381
I can ask her
to look at them.

664
00:57:15,773 --> 00:57:17,399
Lina.

665
00:57:18,513 --> 00:57:20,230
What are these?

666
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:23,380
Hopefully nothing, father.

667
00:57:59,817 --> 00:58:01,390
Father.

668
00:58:02,382 --> 00:58:04,081
What a nice surprise.

669
00:58:04,082 --> 00:58:06,035
I'm sorry to call on you
like this.

670
00:58:06,036 --> 00:58:09,064
I was hoping I could
take you up on that reading.

671
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,376
Oh, uh.

672
00:58:12,866 --> 00:58:14,724
Please come in.

673
00:58:15,196 --> 00:58:19,119
...the landing field by
U.S. astronauts in 1970.

674
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:21,933
I gotta say I'm surprise.
I thought...

675
00:58:21,934 --> 00:58:24,462
I thought you were
against the idea of...

676
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:26,585
I changed my mind.

677
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,671
Astronauts walk and work.
Their capsules make...

678
00:58:30,696 --> 00:58:32,408
Hi, father.

679
00:58:33,139 --> 00:58:35,377
Lina, hi.

680
00:58:35,813 --> 00:58:39,890
I thought I would see first hand
what all the fuss was about.

681
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:42,931
Doris, would you be willing to...

682
00:58:43,046 --> 00:58:46,351
In a series of pinpoint bull's eye splashdowns

683
00:58:58,893 --> 00:59:01,877
Gloria is your wife's name, right?

684
00:59:02,677 --> 00:59:04,333
That's right.

685
00:59:04,527 --> 00:59:06,424
Gloria.

686
00:59:06,471 --> 00:59:08,326
Are you here?

687
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,285
Darling.

688
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:24,437
She's a little hard to hear.

689
00:59:29,978 --> 00:59:32,196
IMISSEDYOU

690
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:35,035
You missed me.

691
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:41,331
Gloria, what's your middle name?

692
00:59:50,943 --> 00:59:52,471
Lynn.

693
00:59:52,857 --> 00:59:54,663
Is that right?

694
00:59:55,142 --> 00:59:57,207
Remarkable.

695
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,276
You forgive me?

696
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,920
For what?

697
01:00:18,402 --> 01:00:20,013
FIGHT

698
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:21,973
Thank you, love.

699
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:25,401
But what was that fight about?

700
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,713
She says it's not important.

701
01:00:38,663 --> 01:00:40,131
DON'T

702
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:42,515
HIDE

703
01:00:44,651 --> 01:00:46,445
BEHIND

704
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,116
COLLAR

705
01:00:51,747 --> 01:00:54,726
WANT YOU

706
01:00:55,435 --> 01:00:58,156
TO BE

707
01:00:58,157 --> 01:00:59,730
Happy.

708
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,082
That was something.

709
01:01:13,957 --> 01:01:16,667
Thank you, Doris, for doing that.

710
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:23,528
I'm afraid that's not the
only reason I came by.

711
01:01:23,529 --> 01:01:26,316
Lina's gotten herself
in some trouble in school.

712
01:01:26,317 --> 01:01:27,284
What?

713
01:01:27,285 --> 01:01:29,335
Isn't that right, Lina?

714
01:01:30,423 --> 01:01:32,044
I'm sorry, Mom.

715
01:01:32,045 --> 01:01:33,963
What kind of trouble?

716
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,552
I rather not talk about it here.

717
01:01:36,553 --> 01:01:39,415
Is there somewhere we can
speak in private?

718
01:01:39,934 --> 01:01:42,974
Um, we can talk in
your office in the morning.

719
01:01:42,975 --> 01:01:46,074
I prefer to speak to you about it
right now, if that's alright?

720
01:01:46,075 --> 01:01:47,813
I promise it won't take long.

721
01:01:47,814 --> 01:01:49,961
We can go up to my room.

722
01:01:49,962 --> 01:01:52,035
I want to come.

723
01:01:53,025 --> 01:01:54,873
How old are you now, Doris?

724
01:01:54,874 --> 01:01:56,092
Nine.

725
01:01:56,093 --> 01:01:59,564
Nine, well.
You're practically a young lady.

726
01:01:59,565 --> 01:02:02,085
You think you can manage to
hold down the fort on your own

727
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:04,542
for a few minutes?
Are you up for that?

728
01:02:05,396 --> 01:02:07,685
What's this about, father?

729
01:02:12,055 --> 01:02:14,379
Can I watch TV?

730
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,295
Of course.

731
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:29,582
It's right this way.

732
01:02:30,757 --> 01:02:32,476
Where did she write them?

733
01:02:32,477 --> 01:02:34,194
Over there.

734
01:02:37,032 --> 01:02:38,846
Where're you going?

735
01:02:39,483 --> 01:02:41,625
Mom, please.

736
01:02:45,182 --> 01:02:48,106
My wife's middle name was Catherine.

737
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:50,093
I'm sorry, I...

738
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,996
Is this about your reading?

739
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:55,130
My mother's middle name was Lynn.

740
01:02:55,131 --> 01:02:58,206
Did you see her writing these,
actually writing them?

741
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:00,031
- Yes, right over there?
- Um.

742
01:03:00,056 --> 01:03:04,821
Sometimes the medium gets confuse,
different voices...

743
01:03:04,846 --> 01:03:06,803
I tricked her.

744
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,162
What are those?

745
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:16,248
Do not believe every spirit, but test
the spirits to see whether they are from God.

746
01:03:16,249 --> 01:03:19,090
For many false prophets
have gone out into the world.

747
01:03:19,091 --> 01:03:21,959
John, chapter 4 verse 1.

748
01:03:22,484 --> 01:03:25,046
I thought this was about Lina.

749
01:03:25,171 --> 01:03:27,382
It's about all of you.

750
01:03:28,027 --> 01:03:29,707
Please.

751
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:39,124
She started by calling me darling,
an easy guess.

752
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:41,286
A common term of endearment.

753
01:03:41,287 --> 01:03:44,362
Then said she missed me
and appealed to comfort.

754
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:45,829
Did you bring my
up here to tell me

755
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:48,710
my 9 year old daughter
is a fraud?

756
01:03:48,711 --> 01:03:50,510
Oh, no.

757
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:54,279
I don't think she's a fraud.
Not at all.

758
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,097
When I asked for
Gloria's middle name,

759
01:03:57,098 --> 01:04:00,190
I thought the word "Lynn"
as hard as I could.

760
01:04:00,191 --> 01:04:02,930
I repeated it over and over
in my mind.

761
01:04:02,931 --> 01:04:05,159
Why would you do that?

762
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:08,403
Because when we ask a question
we know the answer to,

763
01:04:08,404 --> 01:04:12,716
we think the answer
as we ask it.

764
01:04:12,717 --> 01:04:14,374
That's right.

765
01:04:15,303 --> 01:04:17,657
And she was listening to me.

766
01:04:17,658 --> 01:04:20,854
I thought "Lynn",
she said "Lynn".

767
01:04:20,855 --> 01:04:23,931
When I asked what
our fight was about,

768
01:04:23,932 --> 01:04:29,121
I cleared my mind.
Just imagine static on a television set.

769
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:31,396
She changed the subject.

770
01:04:31,397 --> 01:04:34,227
Your wife's voice?

771
01:04:34,576 --> 01:04:35,892
We all heard it.

772
01:04:35,893 --> 01:04:41,134
It was a woman's voice, that's all.
Just a woman's voice.

773
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:43,489
I'm so shocked to hear it
come from her mouth.

774
01:04:43,514 --> 01:04:48,624
I don't really scrutinized whether
it sounded exactly like Gloria.

775
01:04:48,649 --> 01:04:50,720
And she only says one word,

776
01:04:50,745 --> 01:04:52,918
enough for me to hear
it's a woman

777
01:04:52,919 --> 01:04:54,733
but not enough for anything else.

778
01:04:54,734 --> 01:04:59,310
Accent, inflection,
nothing too familiar.

779
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I don't think your daughter
is a fraud.
I believe she is channeling powers
and forces we do not understand.

780
01:05:11,615 --> 01:05:17,117
But, I'm certain
she was not channeling my wife.

781
01:05:24,313 --> 01:05:26,401
Don't take your badge off.

782
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:32,620
Hey, Doris.
What's the skinny?

783
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:34,514
Is Lina home?

784
01:05:34,515 --> 01:05:36,084
Come in.

785
01:05:41,623 --> 01:05:44,504
Actually, not right now.

786
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:47,937
She and Mom are talking
to the man about us.

787
01:05:47,938 --> 01:05:49,950
They'll be right back.

788
01:05:50,682 --> 01:05:53,665
They...
They left you here alone?

789
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:56,522
They'll be here any minute.

790
01:05:57,501 --> 01:06:00,325
She said you should wait.

791
01:06:01,501 --> 01:06:03,013
Yeah?

792
01:06:03,014 --> 01:06:05,839
You want to see something neat?

793
01:06:07,092 --> 01:06:09,959
Yeah, maybe I should...
I should come back later.

794
01:06:09,984 --> 01:06:12,637
There's treasure in the walls.

795
01:06:12,831 --> 01:06:15,764
We used it
to pay the bills.

796
01:06:15,765 --> 01:06:18,180
Yeah, I heard about that,
kind of.

797
01:06:18,181 --> 01:06:20,682
The treasure in the walls,
is that for real?

798
01:06:20,683 --> 01:06:22,548
I'll show you.

799
01:06:29,889 --> 01:06:32,722
She'll be here any second.

800
01:06:36,309 --> 01:06:38,750
This is something Doris wrote.

801
01:06:38,904 --> 01:06:41,766
Sister Hannah came here
from Poland during the War.

802
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:44,286
I asked her to translate them.

803
01:06:44,287 --> 01:06:46,444
It upset her a great deal.

804
01:06:46,445 --> 01:06:48,658
This is a journal from
a man named Marcus,

805
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:51,858
who grew up in Poland
during the Second World War.

806
01:06:54,533 --> 01:06:56,826
He talks about his family,
how they were rounded up

807
01:06:56,827 --> 01:06:59,486
by the Germans during the invasion.

808
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:02,600
It's this way.

809
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:05,004
I found a hole in the wall
behind the furnace

810
01:07:05,005 --> 01:07:07,790
and the money was inside.

811
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:11,434
It was old and dusty.

812
01:07:11,855 --> 01:07:14,070
I think there's more.

813
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:17,633
Hannah talks about a doctor
at the camps.

814
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:20,856
They called him the Devil's doctor

815
01:07:20,881 --> 01:07:22,758
because of his interest
in the occult

816
01:07:22,783 --> 01:07:26,222
and the experiments
he conduct on the patients.

817
01:07:27,036 --> 01:07:30,487
He talks about being
rescued by the Allies.

818
01:07:31,056 --> 01:07:33,252
He came to America
and lived on the streets,

819
01:07:33,253 --> 01:07:34,963
ended up in a mental hospital.

820
01:07:34,964 --> 01:07:37,955
I found some jewelery
in there too.

821
01:07:37,956 --> 01:07:41,781
But I put it back,
for later.

822
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:50,375
He recognized one of the doctors,
using a different name

823
01:07:50,376 --> 01:07:53,336
but he knew it was
the Devil's doctor.

824
01:07:53,984 --> 01:07:57,488
It's not unlikely a lot of them
fled to America after the war.

825
01:07:57,489 --> 01:08:01,757
And then one night, the doctor
took him out of the hospital

826
01:08:01,758 --> 01:08:04,199
and brought him to his house.

827
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:06,794
He describes the house.

828
01:08:06,994 --> 01:08:08,936
This house.

829
01:08:10,437 --> 01:08:13,255
He says the doctor
had a secret room

830
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:18,161
in the basement where the experiments
continued on Marcus and others.

831
01:08:32,351 --> 01:08:34,574
He cut out their tongues.

832
01:08:34,575 --> 01:08:37,808
He severed their vocal cords
and sealed their mouths.

833
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:39,627
Kept them in the secret basement.

834
01:08:39,628 --> 01:08:43,213
So even his people visited
and socialized upstairs

835
01:08:43,214 --> 01:08:45,734
they couldn't be heard below.

836
01:08:46,934 --> 01:08:48,278
My god.

837
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:53,142
And he describes his murder
in great detail.

838
01:08:54,076 --> 01:08:56,068
His murder?

839
01:08:56,289 --> 01:08:58,469
The journal doesn't stop there.

840
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:01,212
There could be
so much more in there.

841
01:09:01,213 --> 01:09:03,719
He talks about after.

842
01:09:03,878 --> 01:09:05,867
After his murder?

843
01:09:05,868 --> 01:09:08,856
Things that can help my family.

844
01:09:17,134 --> 01:09:22,065
He talks about being in the dark
with the others.

845
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:25,678
Voiceless, cold, insane

846
01:09:26,393 --> 01:09:29,806
And he talks about
the other things in the dark.

847
01:09:29,807 --> 01:09:32,246
Things that were never human.

848
01:09:32,247 --> 01:09:34,465
Things that were taking him over.

849
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:36,352
You were right.

850
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What you said about this house.
Good bones.

851
01:09:48,738 --> 01:09:50,242
No.

852
01:09:51,235 --> 01:09:55,471
She knew things.
Things only Roger and I knew.

853
01:09:55,472 --> 01:09:56,441
I asked...

854
01:09:56,466 --> 01:09:59,155
You asked about things that
happened inside the house.

855
01:09:59,156 --> 01:10:02,608
Things that you and Dad
said and did after you moved in.

856
01:10:02,633 --> 01:10:04,196
Of course they knew
all of the answers.

857
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:07,690
They were here
in the house even then.

858
01:10:09,204 --> 01:10:11,118
They were watching.

859
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:16,182
So we move,
we get her out of the house.

860
01:10:16,665 --> 01:10:20,109
The problem isn't the house,
not anymore.

861
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:24,588
I've called the Archdiocese, the Vatican
has people who investigate these things.

862
01:10:24,589 --> 01:10:26,571
- I'll ask them to approve an exorcism.
- Shh.

863
01:10:26,572 --> 01:10:29,253
Shh.
Don't say anything else.

864
01:10:29,952 --> 01:10:33,404
They were watching us
all those years

865
01:10:33,405 --> 01:10:36,265
inside the house,
everything we did.

866
01:10:39,371 --> 01:10:42,080
That means they are
watching us now.

867
01:11:03,911 --> 01:11:06,088
Doris, honey.

868
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
I'll bring her down.
When I got her,
we get her outside...

869
01:11:46,008 --> 01:11:48,942
No, no, no, no!
No!

870
01:11:48,943 --> 01:11:51,144
- No. No. No.
- Honey.

871
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:52,753
- No.
- Honey, look at me.

872
01:11:52,754 --> 01:11:54,625
- No.
- Look at me.

873
01:11:54,626 --> 01:11:57,586
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.

874
01:11:57,955 --> 01:12:00,670
We have to find your sister.

875
01:12:19,815 --> 01:12:21,584
What's that?

876
01:12:26,234 --> 01:12:28,207
The basement.

877
01:12:30,307 --> 01:12:32,139
Lina, wait outside.

878
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,724
No.

879
01:12:35,147 --> 01:12:38,407
No way.
No, that's my sister.

880
01:12:39,249 --> 01:12:43,093
This is my house
and I'm going with you.

881
01:12:45,412 --> 01:12:46,954
Besides,

882
01:12:47,245 --> 01:12:50,905
splitting up sounds like the
stupidest idea in the world.

883
01:12:51,889 --> 01:12:53,804
Okay then.

884
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:58,590
But if we're going down there,
we're burning that thing in the furnace.

885
01:13:10,628 --> 01:13:12,544
Doris.

886
01:13:19,832 --> 01:13:22,984
Doris?
Honey?

887
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Let's burn that.

888
01:14:16,607 --> 01:14:18,426
They're in here.

889
01:14:19,144 --> 01:14:20,927
All of them.

890
01:14:22,304 --> 01:14:24,948
We played in a graveyard.

891
01:14:28,232 --> 01:14:30,019
Do you think that will work?

892
01:14:30,044 --> 01:14:32,035
I honestly don't know.

893
01:14:33,563 --> 01:14:35,100
Mom!

894
01:14:35,579 --> 01:14:37,413
Mom, help.

895
01:14:37,438 --> 01:14:39,523
I'm scared.

896
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:42,261
Mommy, help me.

897
01:14:46,713 --> 01:14:48,941
You stay here with your daughter.

898
01:14:49,782 --> 01:14:52,081
What about staying together?

899
01:14:54,976 --> 01:14:57,556
If she's in there,
I'll bring her out.

900
01:16:23,369 --> 01:16:25,675
That's where we died.

901
01:16:27,852 --> 01:16:31,333
- Our Father who art in heaven...
- He can't see this house, Father.

902
01:16:31,358 --> 01:16:35,262
If he could,
none of us will still be here.

903
01:16:36,382 --> 01:16:38,549
You're not Doris.

904
01:16:40,649 --> 01:16:42,746
Is Doris still here?

905
01:16:46,807 --> 01:16:49,296
I'm sorry this happened to you.

906
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come with me.
I can help you.
Yea, though I walk through
the valley in the shadow of death,
I shall fear no evil.

907
01:17:25,991 --> 01:17:27,683
Father?

908
01:17:29,438 --> 01:17:31,695
Where is she?

909
01:17:33,014 --> 01:17:35,914
She's part of the walls now.

910
01:17:38,165 --> 01:17:39,749
And she told me,

911
01:17:39,774 --> 01:17:43,990
the most wonderful,
awful things.

912
01:17:54,717 --> 01:17:56,329
No!
No!

913
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,720
Tom.

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

915
01:18:25,073 --> 01:18:28,024
- Mom! Mom!
- You got to get out of here!

916
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
What do we do?
I don't know...
Mom!

917
01:19:31,646 --> 01:19:33,319
Stop it.

918
01:19:34,374 --> 01:19:36,123
Let her go.

919
01:19:39,556 --> 01:19:41,595
Speak to me.

920
01:19:42,032 --> 01:19:45,800
I'm a vessel.
I can help you.

921
01:19:46,082 --> 01:19:48,265
She's a better vessel.

922
01:19:49,393 --> 01:19:51,696
What do you want from her?

923
01:19:51,721 --> 01:19:53,356
Voice.

924
01:19:53,381 --> 01:19:55,570
Take mine.

925
01:19:56,227 --> 01:19:58,148
You can cut it out
for all I care,

926
01:19:58,173 --> 01:20:00,782
but you leave my girls alone.

927
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Let them go!
Take me!
We'll take all of you.

928

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

929
01:20:45,548 --> 01:20:47,151
Dad!

930
01:21:01,922 --> 01:21:04,399
What the hell
did you do this for?

931
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:07,636
I didn't.

932
01:21:07,661 --> 01:21:10,129
Dad gave me this
and you know that.

933
01:21:10,154 --> 01:21:12,389
I didn't do it.

934
01:21:12,414 --> 01:21:14,225
Daddy did,

935
01:21:14,226 --> 01:21:16,591
to stop the voices.

936
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:31,019
I didn't do it.

937
01:21:31,356 --> 01:21:33,799
Daddy did,

938
01:21:34,697 --> 01:21:39,418
to stop the voices.

939
01:22:07,812 --> 01:22:10,851
Sweetie, don't.

940
01:22:12,201 --> 01:22:15,950
I just wanted to be able
to talk to Daddy again.

941
01:22:16,612 --> 01:22:20,176
I just wanted you to be
able to talk to Daddy.

942
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:22,250
He's gone.

943
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
He lives in the dark,
and the cold,
and screams and screams and screams...

944
01:22:31,639 --> 01:22:33,551
No, he doesn't

945
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:42,329
Lina?

946
01:22:42,354 --> 01:22:44,332
I'm sorry, Doris.

947
01:24:09,876 --> 01:24:11,670
Daddy.

948
01:24:39,989 --> 01:24:41,583
Doris?

949
01:24:42,821 --> 01:24:44,622
Doris?

950
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,671
No.

951
01:24:56,784 --> 01:24:59,900
No. No. No...

952
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:02,681
No.

953
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:06,590
No.

954
01:25:06,737 --> 01:25:08,522
Oh my god.

955
01:25:08,547 --> 01:25:10,185
Oh god.

956
01:25:10,733 --> 01:25:12,325
Oh god.

957
01:25:12,965 --> 01:25:14,875
My baby.

958
01:25:15,732 --> 01:25:17,410
I had to.

959
01:25:19,277 --> 01:25:21,556
To stop the voices.

960
01:25:42,997 --> 01:25:44,948
I'm sorry.

961
01:25:49,766 --> 01:25:51,496
I'm sorry.

962
01:26:18,297 --> 01:26:19,712
Mom?

963
01:26:20,345 --> 01:26:21,853
Mom.

964
01:26:24,623 --> 01:26:26,134
Mom.

965
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:27,514
It wasn't you.

966
01:26:27,539 --> 01:26:28,962
No.

967
01:26:29,252 --> 01:26:31,223
It wasn't you.

968
01:26:32,756 --> 01:26:35,220
It was my fault.

969
01:26:38,842 --> 01:26:40,972
I love you.

970
01:26:43,032 --> 01:26:45,296
I love you too.

971
01:26:56,985 --> 01:26:58,956
Doris?

972
01:27:09,143 --> 01:27:11,389
Everybody's waiting.

973
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:28,057
No!
I'm sorry!

974
01:27:28,946 --> 01:27:31,850
Oh god!
No!

975
01:27:35,534 --> 01:27:37,673
Hey, Lina.

976
01:27:39,032 --> 01:27:40,616
Lina.

977
01:27:41,082 --> 01:27:42,586
Lina.

978
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:48,254
Where did you go just now?

979
01:27:50,232 --> 01:27:52,309
What were we talking about?

980
01:27:53,255 --> 01:27:56,999
Your sister, again.

981
01:27:58,474 --> 01:27:59,963
Right.

982
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,068
Right.

983
01:28:03,404 --> 01:28:04,834
What about her?

984
01:28:04,859 --> 01:28:08,476
I need you
to try to remember,

985
01:28:08,501 --> 01:28:11,761
anything at all
that can help us find her,

986
01:28:12,016 --> 01:28:15,701
- or her body if she's...
- Of course.

987
01:28:16,686 --> 01:28:20,008
Of course.
I'm sorry.

988
01:28:21,997 --> 01:28:23,780
My mother might know.

989
01:28:23,828 --> 01:28:25,597
I think she said something
about where Doris was.

990
01:28:25,622 --> 01:28:27,485
We've been over this.

991
01:28:27,915 --> 01:28:31,230
She's dead because you...

992
01:28:32,343 --> 01:28:34,286
Right, of course.

993
01:28:35,552 --> 01:28:37,923
You've been here two months, Lina.

994
01:28:39,726 --> 01:28:42,903
We can't find your sister,
and still,

995
01:28:42,904 --> 01:28:46,783
we can't have a proper conversation
about what happened to your mother.

996
01:28:46,808 --> 01:28:48,522
My mother.

997
01:28:51,471 --> 01:28:55,238
Really, the only thing that I can say
about my mother is that...

998
01:28:56,229 --> 01:28:58,595
she wanted to know
that we weren't alone,

999
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:00,725
after my dad died.

1000
01:29:03,803 --> 01:29:05,963
And now she knows.

1001
01:29:08,645 --> 01:29:10,921
We were never alone.

1002
01:29:13,091 --> 01:29:15,297
I'll never be alone.

1003
01:29:18,706 --> 01:29:21,019
I'll never be alone again.

1004
01:30:03,425 --> 01:30:05,044
Doris?

1005
01:30:06,528 --> 01:30:08,190
Are you there?

1006
01:30:13,131 --> 01:30:14,846
Are you there?

1008
01:38:17,844 --> 01:38:19,499
Miss. Zander?

1009
01:38:20,516 --> 01:38:22,620
You have a visitor.

1010
01:38:22,645 --> 01:38:25,159
She says she's your niece.
