1
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:27,422
So, um, the little key is
for the lock up top.

2
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,882
And the one for below.

3
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:31,468
You're not staying?

4
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,928
No, I prefer not to.
Too many memories.

5
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,430
It's good for you?

6
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:37,307
Yeah, of course. I understand.

7
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:40,226
- See you later.
- Okay.

8
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:28,830
Lewis?

9
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:11,289
Lewis, is that you?

10
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:40,943
Lewis!

11
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:15,645
Maureen?

12
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:19,757
Maureen?

13
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,246
Guess I fell asleep.

14
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,330
So?

15
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,084
There was a presence.

16
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:41,212
I-I felt something. I-I just can't...

17
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:47,468
I can't tell, it was too far.

18
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,637
You must make contact.

19
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,807
I think there might need to be
two of us for that.

20
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:55,300
There..There wasn't enough pull.

21
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:57,890
Because I felt something.
It was just keeping its distance.

22
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,649
Come here.

23
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:12,660
You see the cross?

24
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:15,729
Yeah.

25
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:17,540
Has that always been there?

26
00:08:28,268 --> 00:08:30,268
She said that she couldn't
make a contact.

27
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:32,774
Does she still feel a presence?

28
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:35,257
Yes, she says the house is inhabited.

29
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:38,018
Well, we can't buy unless we're sure.

30
00:08:38,738 --> 00:08:41,539
We need to know if
it's benevolent or not.

31
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:42,322
It's too much of an investment.

32
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:46,301
Hey... um...
So, there...

33
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,780
could be no one.

34
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:54,118
But there could be something.
I-I just need more time, I think.

35
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:59,207
It's extremely difficult to find a
portal into the spiritual world.

36
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,625
It's the way that it is.

37
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,877
I was in Stockholm last week,

38
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:06,631
I saw a wonderful exhibition
at the Modern Art Museum.

39
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,133
Hilma af Klint.

40
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,177
Have you ever heard of her?

41
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:13,554
Mm... no.

42
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,473
She says that spirits

43
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,391
commission her paintings.

44
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,936
She invented abstract art

45
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:24,023
before Kandinsky and Malevitch in 1906.

46
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:25,233
She says that

47
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,152
the spirit-world communicated with us

48
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,445
through her.

49
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:39,749
Hilma af Klint

50
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:55,767
<i>ABSTRACTION</i>

51
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:56,859
PIONEER

52
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,559
What fascinated me when I discovered
Hilma af Klint's work was...

53
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:04,272
That these grand and enigmatic paintings

54
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,690
had been painted in the early 1900's.

55
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,484
And that they were made
by a Swedish female artist

56
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,945
that I hadn't heard about before.

57
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:13,614
Maybe the most fascinating
part is that these pieces

58
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:17,243
were made before the
conception of abstract art.

59
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:21,539
But Hilma af Klint kept her art secret,

60
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:26,294
She was sure that they wouldn't
be understood during her life.

61
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,463
In her will she decided that they would

62
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,341
be kept hidden until 
20 years after her death.

63
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,970
<i>So, a century ago, Hilma af Klint</i>

64
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:37,680
painted for the future.

65
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,683
And the future is here now.

66
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:50,735
Are you okay?

67
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,571
It didn't bore you
too much at reception?

68
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:57,575
No, no more than normal
I lost my passport.

69
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,195
How long will she
be in Milan for?

70
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:00,653
Two days.

71
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,580
I put everything on a rack.

72
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:07,043
Here are the leather pants
from the new collection.

73
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:10,963
They're Kyra's style.
I mean, I can see her in them.

74
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,883
Are we able to cut them? Is it possible?
They'll be too big.

75
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:15,885
Let me look into this.

76
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,789
I'll get them for you from the studio.

77
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,624
I'm not really supposed to, but...

78
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,468
Please, you bring them back
as soon as you can,

79
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:49,717
otherwise I will be in big trouble.

80
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,961
Of course.

81
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:54,215
- She's going to need something a little
flashier for the amfAR dinner.
- Yeah.

82
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,720
That's the stuff Louis
set aside for the dinner.

83
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,140
If Louis likes it, then she'll love it.

84
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:08,938
- You like it?
- Mm.

85
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:11,690
So does Louis.
It's not easy to wear.

86
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:18,531
It's sensual and strong.

87
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:22,493
- I'll take it, and some boots.
- Okay.

88
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,874
I think I'll take both bags
and this belt.

89
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,169
You know her. Don't want to risk it.

90
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,088
Kyra would want the brown, for sure.

91
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:18,716
Or the blue. Or neither.

92
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,618
Ah, she gave me a blank cheque.

93
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,047
- Do...do you take deposits?
- Yes.
- Okay.

94
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:26,056
- She wants 4,500.
- Cool.

95
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,413
500 for the belt, and
2,000 for each bag.

96
00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:29,953
Great.

97
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,452
<i>Maureen, I got back but
I have to leave right away.</i>

98
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,413
<i>We'll miss each other.
I'm off to Milan tomorrow morning.</i>

99
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,958
<i>I'm leaving an envelope with what
I owe you for the last two weeks.</i>

100
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,584
<i>Take care. Kyra.</i>

101
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,920
<i>PS: I left my Mac on the desk.</i>

102
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:39,838
<i>Can you do the upgrade for me?</i>

103
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:45,404
<i>Hilma af Klint has
moved in spiritual circles</i>

104
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,656
<i>and participated in séances,</i>

105
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:50,409
<i>later also she was a medium.</i>

106
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:54,622
<i>What actually is regarded as
the essence of spiritualism?</i>

107
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,166
<i>Well, the central idea of spiritualism,</i>

108
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:01,128
<i>is the idea that there is
a world beyond our world.</i>

109
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:05,758
<i>And spiritualists try to give
empirical proof of this world.</i>

110
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,801
<i>In 1848,</i>

111
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,596
<i>the Fox sisters heard rappings</i>

112
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:15,017
<i>and they interpreted these rappings
as messages from deceased persons.</i>

113
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,145
And that was for them real proof

114
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:22,149
<i>of the existence of a higher world
beyond our world.</i>

115
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:26,654
<i>It's interesting that the Moriset code
had been invented 2 years earlier.</i>

116
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,241
<i>The spiritualists were always very close
to the technological avant-garde.</i>

117
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,286
<i>For example, the first
abstract photographs</i>

118
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:37,164
<i>have been taken by spiritualists.</i>

119
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:41,210
<i>Hilma af Klint believed that she
received the abstract paintings</i>

120
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:43,545
<i>from higher levels of consciousness.</i>

121
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,714
<i>When she started to paint as a medium,</i>

122
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:50,177
<i>she rejected the skills she
had learned at the art academy.</i>

123
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:55,057
<i>And that was due to the influence
of spiritualism and theosophy.</i>

124
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:56,642
<i>Now you mentioned theosophy,</i>

125
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:59,687
<i>What was Rudolf Steiner's
view on abstract art?</i>

126
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,648
<i>Steiner rejected abstract paintings.</i>

127
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,442
<i>But that's not the whole story...</i>

128
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:10,114
<i>- Hey.
- I've been trying to reach you for a week.</i>

129
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,907
I know. I've been working.

130
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,158
A lot.

131
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:14,493
Sorry.

132
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,578
<i>How's it going with Kyra?</i>

133
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,622
Ah...I never see her.

134
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:20,499
We leave each other messages.

135
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,418
I hate this job, actually.

136
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,253
I fucking hate her.
She's a...

137
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,088
<i>That's not what you said before.</i>

138
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,676
Yeah I was just happy to stay in Paris
and pay my rent.

139
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:32,511
<i>Yeah, well, what's changed?</i>

140
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,723
I spend my days
doing bullshit

141
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,970
That doesn't interest me, and
it keeps me from what does.

142
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:39,066
It's driving me fucking crazy.

143
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,270
<i>You should come here.</i>

144
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,231
Yeah, to the Sultanate of Oman?

145
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,150
<i>I'll be here another two months.</i>

146
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,278
I thought you were almost done?

147
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:52,197
<i>I finished reconfiguring the 
embassy's computer system</i>

148
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:55,117
<i>and now I'm just waiting for 
the security protocols.</i>

149
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,244
When do you think you'll get those?

150
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:59,830
<i>It could be tomorrow,
could be next month...</i>

151
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,876
<i>And once I get them I start the
installing and configure them.</i>

152
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,377
<i>Come to Muscat!</i>

153
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,590
<i>Look, I came to the seaside
for the weekend.</i>

154
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:16,764
<i>- Wow.
- It's beautiful.</i>

155
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,393
What the hell would I do in Muscat?

156
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,020
<i>What the hell you do in Paris?</i>

157
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,064
You know.

158
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,151
I'm waiting. I have to wait.

159
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:31,987
<i>It's been three months.</i>

160
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,034
I think I felt something.

161
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:41,079
I need to go back to Lewis' house.
I really think I felt something.

162
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,540
<i>You think you felt something
or you're sure?</i>

163
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,669
I just need to see it to the end.
That's all.

164
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,800
This is perfect. This works. Thank you.

165
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,092
This too.

166
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,722
I see this...

167
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,643
Actually it may be perfect.

168
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,438
I'd like to see them on you.

169
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,315
You don't want to try them on?

170
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,944
I... you know that I can't.

171
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:13,779
But you want to.

172
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,282
Sure, I mean.. if you could
keep your mouth shut, maybe...

173
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,910
but you totally dicked me over
the last time I did it.

174
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,496
Try on the shoes at least.
I'll get them.

175
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:30,671
They're the same size.
She won't have to send them back.

176
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:33,277
Okay, Vincent...

177
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,342
You have to promise me...

178
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,720
Not one word. Not one word.

179
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,305
My lips are sealed.

180
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:15,632
Really?

181
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,302
If there's traffic, there's traffic.
Nothing you can do about it.

182
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,636
They'll wait.

183
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,472
They just need a little daylight.
It's okay.

184
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,975
No, I can't wait. I have an appointment.

185
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:27,769
I'll meet you at your place
later this afternoon?

186
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:29,304
Okay.

187
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,900
The leather pants? They're great, right?

188
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,362
No, not these..you can't keep...
I promised...

189
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:40,009
I promised that I'd bring them
back in the morning.

190
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,279
Please don't do that to me.

191
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,205
I'm telling them right now.
It's no problems. Don't worry. Okay.

192
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:52,085
Hey so, she is on her way. She's late.
Her plane from Milan was just delayed.

193
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,420
But where is she?

194
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,672
She's on a highway.
There's traffic, apparently.

195
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,759
Can you stand in for her?
It'll save some time.

196
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,219
I have to leave at four o'clock.

197
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,889
Yeah, that's okay. It's perfect.
Come.

198
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,475
You think she'll ditch everything?

199
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:10,187
Yeah, she'll ditch everything.
I brought you three options though so...

200
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:11,897
With that we'll make it through?

201
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,650
I can't make any promises.

202
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,694
I'd feel more comfortable if you stayed.

203
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:20,864
You scared of Kyra?

204
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,991
I hear she's a monster.

205
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,833
This is your left ventricle.

206
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,461
It's just slightly larger in size.

207
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,255
It was exactly the same
for your twin brother.

208
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,426
You can live with it and die at 100.

209
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,053
Or at 27.

210
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,973
I treated Lewis just like I treated you.

211
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,975
An ultrasound twice a year.

212
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,143
There was no sign. Nothing

213
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,728
One day, it just gave way.

214
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:56,358
Don't be scared, Maureen. What
happened to Lewis is very exceptional.

215
00:21:58,443 --> 00:21:59,569
You can get up.

216
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,458
Everything is fine.

217
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,753
You just need to keep avoiding
both intense physical efforts

218
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,630
and extreme emotions.

219
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,215
Like Lewis did...

220
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,969
- I mean,... he built cabinets.
- I know.

221
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,892
He wanted to turn the house into a 
studio where he could teach

222
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,770
and practice carpentry.

223
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,399
He really considered it his future.

224
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,318
I'll see you again in six months?

225
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,280
I have no idea where I'm going
to be in six months.

226
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,076
Good evening, Maureen.

227
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,954
Excuse me, we haven't met.

228
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:52,581
I'm Ingo.

229
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,041
Hi! Um, sorry...

230
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,585
Is Kyra here?

231
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,670
In her room with her lawyer.

232
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:01,214
They've been on a conference call
for an hour.

233
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,966
Problems with the foundation.

234
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,887
I'm just here to pick up a few things. 
She's aware.

235
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,680
Do you know where they are?

236
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,932
There is one garment bag over there.

237
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:24,988
Um, random question, but

238
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:27,657
do you happen to know about two
pairs of leather pants?

239
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,326
They should be in the bag.

240
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,994
She wants to keep them.

241
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:33,527
Oh.

242
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:37,193
Okay.

243
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,794
She's just in there?

244
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,717
Ah, she's a real fucking
pain-in-the-ass, right?

245
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,770
We've been working on this
for six months.

246
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:59,815
We can't just call off the press trip
at the last minute.

247
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:00,500
Hey Kyra?

248
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:02,943
<i>We have a 2-year-old gorilla
who's been gone for three weeks.</i>

249
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,945
<i>and now we have a problem with
the whole family.</i>

250
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,614
Mrs. Gellman's husband invests
a lot of time and money

251
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,574
into gorilla habitat preservation.

252
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,451
He cares deeply about gorillas.

253
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:12,590
But if things go wrong,

254
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:14,830
this reflects really badly
on his business interests...

255
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,206
Hey Kyra, can I just
ask you one quick q...

256
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,667
This is serious.
You need to take care of this.

257
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:19,417
Hello?

258
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,877
<i>The female is agressive.</i>

259
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,880
<i>The male, Ngabo, you've dealt with him
is becoming aggressive.</i>

260
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,758
Ngabo can become very aggressive
in stressful situations.

261
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:28,718
I remember very well, thank you.

262
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:31,096
Where are they now?
Where are the gorillas?

263
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:34,766
They wander off further and further
into the mountains

264
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:36,434
<i>and it's difficult to monitor them.</i>

265
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,562
We can't cancel the reporters!

266
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:41,731
We have contractual obligations.
We need those gorillas to be there.

267
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,108
Just one quick question?

268
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:47,362
I'm hearing problems,
I'm not hearing solutions.

269
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,036
Mind if I smoke?

270
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:03,503
You have nothing better to do
besides dress Kyra?

271
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:05,922
Really find it worthy of your time?

272
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,260
Do you have a better offer?

273
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:11,761
Not exactly.

274
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:14,132
<i>I'm a correspondent for 
Men's Vogue</i> in Berlin.

275
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:15,348
I can put in a word for you.

276
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:16,850
Thank you.

277
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,104
But I..you know, magazines aren't
really my thing.

278
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,899
They sell shit.

279
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:28,486
Mainly for advertisers,
rather than readers.

280
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,323
So what?
You already have a stupid job.

281
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,074
It wouldn't change a thing but,

282
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:34,618
it pays better.

283
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,372
Not for me.

284
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:44,794
Some highly-regarded photographers
publish in fashion magazines.

285
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,171
Are they free?

286
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,839
I suppose so.

287
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,761
They get to choose their brands
and subjects they shoot?

288
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,679
No, that's correct.

289
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,932
I don't really see the freedom in that.

290
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:58,767
Yeah, I'm going to go.

291
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:02,145
I'll take the dress and the bags.

292
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:05,899
You really need to tell her
she's gottta return those pants.

293
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,609
I'll come back tomorrow.

294
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:10,237
You know she'll be here tomorrow?

295
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,200
Ask her.

296
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,327
She'll tell me to leave.

297
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,623
And you're not leaving?

298
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:25,043
I'm waiting for her to finish.
I want to speak with her.

299
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,628
She wants to dump me.

300
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,048
How long's it been?

301
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,051
Two years.

302
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:37,222
But she's scared her husband
will find out.

303
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:39,766
I'm sure he suspects something.

304
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,434
You in love with her?

305
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:42,644
Love?

306
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:46,231
It never crossed my mind, no.

307
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:47,857
It's just physical.

308
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:52,195
What are you doing in Paris?

309
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:55,699
I'm...waiting.

310
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:58,118
I'm gonna go.

311
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:00,787
What are you waiting for?

312
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:07,794
My...uh... brother died here.

313
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,088
My twin brother,

314
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:11,589
died in Paris.

315
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:13,716
An accident?

316
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:14,238
No.

317
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:18,346
A heart attack.

318
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:23,393
I actually have the same...

319
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,270
malformation.

320
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:29,733
Does it scare you?

321
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:30,859
No.

322
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,652
And it didn't scare him.

323
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,406
You stay here to mourn.

324
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:37,866
No, I'm waiting.

325
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,159
I told you I was waiting.

326
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,328
What are you waiting for?

327
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,499
So, we made this oath.

328
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,506
Whoever died first would
send the other a sign.

329
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:55,300
A sign?

330
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:58,845
From the afterlife?

331
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:02,307
You could call it that.
You could call it a million things.

332
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,810
But how will you know it's a sign?

333
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,021
I'm a medium.

334
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,690
He was a medium.

335
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,277
I'll just know it.

336
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,658
Have you communicated
with spirits before?

337
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:24,746
Lewis thought there were... spirits.
I'm less sure.

338
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:26,748
But... y-yes.

339
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:30,877
Somewhat.

340
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:37,175
There are invisible presences...

341
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:39,677
around us, always.

342
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:43,056
Whether or not they're the souls
 of the dead, I don't know, but...

343
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,977
When you're a medium,
you just are attuned to a certain...

344
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,023
vibe.

345
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:54,651
What do you mean by, vibe?

346
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:59,322
It's an intuition thing.
It's a feeling you...

347
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:01,950
You see this door...

348
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:05,078
It's only like slightly ajar.

349
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,956
I also this that...

350
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:10,417
the soul...

351
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,461
continues to exist after death.

352
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:16,172
I don't really know if
I believe in that.

353
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,009
But Lewis did.

354
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:25,932
And I have to give his spirit...

355
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,351
whatever you want to call it...

356
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:30,103
a chance to prove him right.

357
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,398
Until when?

358
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,400
I had a sign.

359
00:29:36,194 --> 00:29:38,194
- Oh?
- Yeah!

360
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:40,196
Are you sure?

361
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:43,074
No. That's why I'm still waiting.

362
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,660
And then?

363
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:54,210
Then I guess I'll live my life.

364
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,795
Let it go.

365
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:50,683
I'll come for you in the morning.

366
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,727
- Or before. Call when you want.
- Okay

367
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,272
Thank you.

368
00:31:03,223 --> 00:31:06,023
So we thought about it,
and we're renovating.

369
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,059
I think that's what Lewis
would have wanted.

370
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:11,491
I just wanted Maureen to be
at peace with this place.

371
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:13,393
And with Lewis' spirit.

372
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:24,464
I... I just wanted to say one last...

373
00:31:24,905 --> 00:31:28,809
Lewis would have been very happy
that this house is yours again...

374
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:31,672
And I'm very glad too.

375
00:31:32,553 --> 00:31:36,096
Now, it's your house and...

376
00:31:37,217 --> 00:31:38,939
I'll forget it.

377
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,438
Come on.

378
00:33:02,622 --> 00:33:04,122
Come on.

379
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,433
I need more from you.

380
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:21,512
I'm gonna need more from you.

381
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:54,260
Give me one more sign.

382
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:56,679
Anything.

383
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:03,853
Give me the tiniest thing.

384
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:08,191
Is that it? Is that it?

385
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:15,573
Just the tiniest little thing...

386
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,913
Is it that you can see me,
you cannot talk to me?

387
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Because I don't care what you do
with the fucking plumbing.
I need you to fucking talk to me!

388
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:35,259
Please, I don't understand.

389
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:51,943
You're not my brother.

390
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,410
You're not my brother.

391
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

392
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:42,029
<i>Unknown: I know you.</i>

393
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,309
<i>Unknown: And you know me.</i>

394
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:31,746
<i>Unknown: You're off to London.</i>

395
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:49,972
<i>Who is this?</i>

396
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,654
<i>Unknown: Have a guess.</i>

397
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:12,787
<i>No, answer my question.</i>

398
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,929
<i>Are you a man or a woman?</i>

399
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:49,156
<i>Unknown: What difference does it make?</i>

400
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:09,552
<i>Are you real?</i>

401
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:26,277
<i>Are you alive or dead?</i>

402
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:37,288
<i>Alive or dead??</i>

403
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:57,563
Lewis?

404
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:01,501
Airplane Mode: On

405
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:46,065
<i>Unknown: I want you.</i>

406
00:42:50,007 --> 00:42:52,007
Stop

407
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,035
<i>I want you and I will have you.</i>

408
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:06,961
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

409
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,300
<i>I'm blocking you.</i>

410
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,139
<i>You don't want to know who I am anymore?</i>

411
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:30,025
<i>Unknown: I'm here. I'm watching you.</i>

412
00:43:39,493 --> 00:43:41,370
<i>Unknown: I'm kidding. I'm not there.</i>

413
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:43,998
<i>Unknown: But I may be in London.</i>

414
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:59,179
<i>Unknown: You want to know where?</i>

415
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:08,564
<i>Where?</i>

416
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,947
<i>Thanks for answering.</i>

417
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:19,700
<i>Where??</i>

418
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:26,540
<i>I won't be in London.</i>

419
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:37,968
<i>Are you relieved?</i>

420
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:39,762
<i>Or disappointed?</i>

421
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:06,622
<i>What do you want?</i>

422
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:11,668
<i>You.</i>

423
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:13,295
<i>Not physically.</i>

424
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:16,507
<i>To make contact.</i>

425
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:17,925
<i>First.</i>

426
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,437
I've prepared everything Kyra asked for.

427
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:32,773
Two dresses she picked
from the photograph,

428
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,859
and a third one that didn't photograph
so well but I think she'll like it.

429
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:37,820
Which one?

430
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,238
This one there.

431
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:42,491
It's silk organza.

432
00:45:42,658 --> 00:45:45,244
In a photo you lose some
of the sheen but,

433
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:47,538
It really plays well with the light.

434
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:49,415
Oh yeah, it's cool.

435
00:45:50,374 --> 00:45:51,417
It's really cool.

436
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,544
The harness comes in
different colours as well.

437
00:45:54,086 --> 00:45:55,212
- Can I see them?
- Yeah.

438
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:00,259
There you go.
We've got gold, black and nude.

439
00:46:00,426 --> 00:46:01,385
In black.

440
00:46:01,552 --> 00:46:04,638
Not for all tastes, but I think
it'll look amazing with Kyra.

441
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:07,391
Do you want to try it?

442
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:09,726
Come.

443
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,835
<i>Unknown: I suggest a game.</i>

444
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:42,593
<i>I hate games.</i>

445
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:46,597
Sorry.

446
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:08,744
You want to try the dress?

447
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:13,499
No, I'll take it in two colours
so that she has the option.

448
00:47:13,957 --> 00:47:15,292
Cool. I'll get it all packed up for you.

449
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:27,596
Unknown: Then not a game.
Something else.

450
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:49,201
<i>Meaning??</i>

451
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,959
<i>Are you waiting for your train?</i>

452
00:47:58,794 --> 00:47:59,795
<i>Yes.</i>

453
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:07,052
<i>So answer my questions.</i>

454
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:12,224
<i>Do you want to be someone else?</i>

455
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:30,576
<i>Yes.</i>

456
00:48:35,664 --> 00:48:36,748
<i>Who?</i>

457
00:48:41,128 --> 00:48:42,754
<i>I don't know.</i>

458
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:49,636
<i>I can't know for you.</i>

459
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:10,157
<i>Tell me something you find unsettling.</i>

460
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:15,203
<i>Horror movies.</i>

461
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:18,999
<i>Why?</i>

462
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:29,718
<i>A woman runs from a killer and hides.</i>

463
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,766
<i>What you find unsettling is fear.</i>

464
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,395
<i>Are you often scared?</i>

465
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:42,648
<i>No.</i>

466
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:45,150
Unknown number

467
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:53,450
I'm on the train.

468
00:49:56,453 --> 00:49:58,580
I'll drop the stuff off this evening.

469
00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:00,582
When do you get back?

470
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:07,506
Even if it's early afternoon,

471
00:50:07,673 --> 00:50:09,466
It's okay. It'll be ready for you
in a garment bag.

472
00:50:10,092 --> 00:50:12,129
I have to pick up
the jewellery from Cartier,

473
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,760
but everything, they said, is ready.

474
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:20,977
I would prefer it in euros
if that's not a problem...

475
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:24,022
You know you could ask your driver to
stop at an ATM on the way back from CTG.

476
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:26,024
It'll take two seconds.

477
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,074
It was 400.

478
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:35,909
We agreed on 400.

479
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:40,914
There are a couple of
taxi receipts as well.

480
00:50:45,711 --> 00:50:46,712
See you tomorrow.

481
00:50:56,763 --> 00:51:01,101
<i>Yesterday, I tried on the shoes
of the woman I work for.</i>

482
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:06,732
<i>Why are you telling me?</i>

483
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:21,496
<i>Because she wouldn't let me try them on.</i>

484
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:29,129
<i>So the answer is what's forbidden?</i>

485
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:46,062
<i>No desire if it's not forbidden.</i>

486
00:51:52,903 --> 00:51:54,696
<i>What else is forbidden?</i>

487
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,045
<i>Unknown: Answering my questions?</i>

488
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:18,595
Yes.

489
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,895
<i>Unknown: Are you back?</i>

490
00:53:51,521 --> 00:53:52,439
<i>Yes.</i>

491
00:53:58,403 --> 00:53:59,738
<i>Your place?</i>

492
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:05,702
<i>Kyra's?</i>

493
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:10,957
<i>How do you know?</i>

494
00:54:15,462 --> 00:54:18,214
<i>You want to try on Kyra's dresses?</i>

495
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:27,390
<i>Yep.</i>

496
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,229
<i>Because it is forbidden?</i>

497
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:42,604
<i>I did it.</i>

498
00:58:53,156 --> 00:58:54,866
<i>You're scared.</i>

499
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:02,665
<i>Yeah I am.</i>

500
00:59:06,127 --> 00:59:08,880
<i>I thought you wanted to be someone else.</i>

501
01:01:23,473 --> 01:01:24,599
How are you?

502
01:01:25,016 --> 01:01:27,143
You're sure the spirit isn't there,
anymore?

503
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,186
Yes.

504
01:01:28,895 --> 01:01:31,064
She vomited this ectoplasm

505
01:01:31,606 --> 01:01:32,774
and left.

506
01:01:33,316 --> 01:01:35,443
And the ectoplasm lingered for a minute,

507
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:37,695
or less and then also disappeared.

508
01:01:38,363 --> 01:01:40,365
Do you have an idea of what she wanted?

509
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:44,035
She was really angry. Very violent.

510
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:47,121
Maybe she had a score to settle.

511
01:01:47,455 --> 01:01:48,790
I think she was lost.

512
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:54,420
I don't think she wants to come back.
I don't think she'll be there again.

513
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:01,427
And what about Lewis?

514
01:02:03,846 --> 01:02:05,431
It's been 95 days.

515
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:12,480
Jérôme and Cassandre
are getting the bigger house.

516
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:17,318
Good.

517
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:24,575
You know, Lewis really loved them 
so that's...

518
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:26,035
perfect.

519
01:02:28,913 --> 01:02:29,914
What about you?

520
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,129
What'll you do with the money?

521
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:37,922
Nothing.

522
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,799
Nothing.

523
01:02:41,676 --> 01:02:42,760
I don't know.

524
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:45,847
I'm not sure I can buy something else.

525
01:02:46,472 --> 01:02:48,391
I'm not confident enough
about the future.

526
01:02:51,436 --> 01:02:52,603
I feel you.

527
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:56,107
I don't think you understand.

528
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,278
I definitely understand. Trust me.

529
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:08,619
I met someone.

530
01:03:08,995 --> 01:03:10,079
You met some..., like you...

531
01:03:11,146 --> 01:03:13,146
Oh!

532
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:16,679
Look,

533
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:19,922
You must've known them before.

534
01:03:20,882 --> 01:03:22,216
Well, kind of...

535
01:03:24,218 --> 01:03:25,803
A friend of a friend.

536
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:33,436
After Lewis died, he reached out to me,

537
01:03:34,312 --> 01:03:35,771
and we grew closer.

538
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:41,569
You're shocked.

539
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:43,362
No. Good. I think it's...

540
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:47,575
I was expecting it but like, of course.

541
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:49,994
I'll always love Lewis,

542
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:52,413
but I can't spend my life in mourning.

543
01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:55,291
I'm not interested in mourning,

544
01:03:55,917 --> 01:03:58,419
Like suffering in pain,
I've had enough.

545
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:03,049
I think now I want life.

546
01:04:31,577 --> 01:04:32,995
The other day, you said

547
01:04:33,162 --> 01:04:35,831
Victor Hugo actu.., you know, you said
that he communicated with spirits...

548
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:38,167
What did you mean by that?
Like actually talked to them?

549
01:04:39,252 --> 01:04:42,088
When he was exiled in Jersey,
he turned tables.

550
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:46,259
Like he conversed with famous
historical figures like,

551
01:04:46,551 --> 01:04:48,344
even biblical ones.

552
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:49,845
It's pretty out there.

553
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:50,763
How?

554
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,640
How?

555
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:55,851
I don't really know.

556
01:04:56,394 --> 01:04:58,896
I mean literally.
Like verbally or with an alphabet?

557
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:02,483
No, no, not the alphabet. They tried,
but the spirit refused.

558
01:05:03,651 --> 01:05:04,902
So what did he do?

559
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:06,862
With a pedestal table.

560
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:10,825
The leg would tap on the floor like,
once for "yes", twice for "no".

561
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:14,870
Like one for "A", two for "B"
and so on like,

562
01:05:15,037 --> 01:05:16,455
26 for "Z".

563
01:05:16,622 --> 01:05:18,958
That would take an unbelievable
amount of time.

564
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:21,877
Yeah. There were pages and pages
of transcriptions.

565
01:05:23,421 --> 01:05:24,839
Well, that's gotta be bullshit.

566
01:05:25,006 --> 01:05:26,299
- That's invented.
- Ah, no, no, no.

567
01:05:27,216 --> 01:05:29,635
- there's no way that happened.
- No he really believed it.

568
01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:32,972
It was not intended for publication.
So, why invent it?

569
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:34,849
I think whoever did the transcripts

570
01:05:35,016 --> 01:05:37,643
must have adapted them,
filled in the gaps.

571
01:05:38,019 --> 01:05:39,854
So, like stenography?
Kind of.

572
01:05:40,021 --> 01:05:41,564
Yeah, that's a good analogy.

573
01:05:41,814 --> 01:05:43,232
But if you're interested,

574
01:05:43,399 --> 01:05:46,444
there's a TV movie from the sixties
that depicts the séance.

575
01:05:47,361 --> 01:05:49,905
It's really tacky, but seems accurate.

576
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:53,367
I'll find the title for you,
but if you type in like:

577
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:57,246
"Hugo+Jersey+Turning Tables"
on YouTube, you will find it.

578
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:04,003
Crazy dog, aren't you?

579
01:06:12,012 --> 01:06:14,394
"Victor Hugo in Jersey."

580
01:06:23,323 --> 01:06:27,367
The being called the white lady asked me
on the first day a thing that I did.

581
01:06:28,386 --> 01:06:32,773
I know that a being, afraid
of coming, ran away.

582
01:06:34,154 --> 01:06:35,956
Is there someone here?

583
01:06:37,197 --> 01:06:38,679
If yes knock once...

584
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,220
If no knock twice.

585
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,830
Before I ask you who you are,
I'll ask you a question.

586
01:06:51,111 --> 01:06:54,895
But first, this question, do
you see it in my thoughts?

587
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,062
Do you want to answer it?

588
01:07:06,987 --> 01:07:07,988
Then talk.

589
01:07:25,245 --> 01:07:26,887
The mountain is my grave.

590
01:07:27,467 --> 01:07:32,553
I'm God's breath, I go up and down,
I want the sky and the Earth wants me.

591
01:07:33,044 --> 01:07:37,017
The stars pull me by my hair and the
nails of the coffin hold me by my feet.

592
01:07:37,538 --> 01:07:41,481
The darkness screams to me: "Down!"
And the Sun says "Up!" to me.

593
01:07:42,202 --> 01:07:44,044
I'm the uncomforted of the horizon.

594
01:07:44,304 --> 01:07:46,641
I'm the night watcher 
of countless graves,

595
01:07:46,642 --> 01:07:48,534
emptying his eyes in empty skulls.

596
01:07:49,049 --> 01:07:51,351
I'm the cause of bad dreams.

597
01:08:05,701 --> 01:08:08,701
Vincent can see the plain.

598
01:08:09,651 --> 01:08:11,651
That is a reason.

599
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:22,001
I'm everywhere but
I'm not sure what.

600
01:08:22,776 --> 01:08:24,776
I get up and go to bed.

601
01:08:24,663 --> 01:08:26,663


602
01:08:43,951 --> 01:08:45,951


603
01:09:38,551 --> 01:09:40,344
<i>Unknown: Send me a picture.</i>

604
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:05,578
<i>I prefer you like this.</i>

605
01:10:20,009 --> 01:10:22,761
<i>I feel ridiculous, it's not me.</i>

606
01:10:26,515 --> 01:10:28,684
<i>I'm ashamed of myself.</i>

607
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:37,943
<i>I don't know why I came.</i>

608
01:10:44,116 --> 01:10:46,243
<i>Keep the key. You'll be coming back.</i>

609
01:10:48,212 --> 01:10:49,512
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

610
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:52,917
I need to know what name
was room 724 was booked under?

611
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:55,127
Okay, just a second.

612
01:10:55,294 --> 01:10:56,837
724...

613
01:10:58,797 --> 01:10:59,882
It was...

614
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:03,093
Maureen Cartwright, I have.

615
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:08,057
No, I'm Maureen Cartwright.
Who paid for the room?

616
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:09,391
Just a sec.

617
01:11:12,144 --> 01:11:13,646
I'm sorry, there is no
credit card information.

618
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:16,190
Was paid in advance in cash.

619
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:19,568
Do you remember if it was
a man or a woman?

620
01:11:19,777 --> 01:11:21,445
I don't know. I was not working
at that moment.

621
01:11:21,612 --> 01:11:23,280
Would you ask a collegue?
Do you know...?

622
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:25,115
It's a big hotel.

623
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:27,284
I'm not sure I can help you with that.

624
01:11:38,022 --> 01:11:39,322
Thank you.

625
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,980
These are the five pieces
of your selection.

626
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:59,984
And particularly the "Pont des Arts"
of the "Paris Nouvelle" collection.

627
01:12:00,234 --> 01:12:03,237
Made of 18 carat rose gold
and fine stones.

628
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:04,726
C'est bien. Yes, it's perfect.

629
01:12:04,727 --> 01:12:06,621
The necklace, the bracelet,
the ring and the watch,

630
01:12:06,824 --> 01:12:09,368
but excluding this.
I've never seen that.

631
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:11,537
Okay. We'll focus on these four.

632
01:12:11,704 --> 01:12:13,038
- Okay.
-I'll prepare them for you then.

633
01:12:13,038 --> 01:12:13,497
Merci.

634
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:14,498
You're welcome.

635
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:20,227
And this one is brand new,
first time released.

636
01:12:20,228 --> 01:12:21,081
So nobody has it.

637
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:24,508
Oh, good. That's important. Thank you.

638
01:13:05,674 --> 01:13:07,009
Hey Kyra, you back?

639
01:13:12,598 --> 01:13:16,060
Sorry, I let myself in. I'm just gonna
drop these bags for you, okay?

640
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:36,371
Hey Kyra, you doing alright?

641
01:13:46,016 --> 01:13:47,016
Hey?

642
01:16:12,861 --> 01:16:14,154
Are you ready?

643
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:23,330
I drove for...

644
01:16:24,748 --> 01:16:27,167
2 minutes maybe before
I realised what I was doing,

645
01:16:27,334 --> 01:16:29,461
And I came back and called.

646
01:16:30,629 --> 01:16:32,923
Why didn't you do it earlier?

647
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:40,639
I-I-I...I freaked out.

648
01:16:42,182 --> 01:16:43,517
I-I-I ran away.

649
01:16:44,893 --> 01:16:47,312
You ran away from a presence...

650
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:51,608
There way a light on in the...

651
01:16:53,694 --> 01:16:56,780
back of the apartment,
I heard something.

652
01:16:57,322 --> 01:17:00,033
What were you doing at Mrs. Gellman's?

653
01:17:00,575 --> 01:17:02,494
Dropping off a couple of bags.

654
01:17:03,912 --> 01:17:05,330
I don't understand.

655
01:17:06,123 --> 01:17:08,417
I'm a personal shopper. She was...

656
01:17:09,418 --> 01:17:11,545
very high profile and couldn't...

657
01:17:12,379 --> 01:17:15,048
do normal things, didn't have time.

658
01:17:15,716 --> 01:17:17,509
And I sort of assisted her in that.

659
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:27,686
You used Mrs. Gellman's computer
last night.

660
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:29,438
Um, maybe.

661
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:31,148
And again this morning.

662
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:35,193
You check your messages on Gmail.

663
01:17:35,944 --> 01:17:37,904
We have the record.

664
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:41,700
So, why are you asking?

665
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:43,827
Did you sleep at her place?

666
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:47,850
Did you sleep at her place?

667
01:17:47,873 --> 01:17:49,458
Yes, I did. I slept at her place.

668
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:50,584
Why?

669
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,382
Um, I don't know.

670
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:00,010
To be honest, I never do that.

671
01:18:00,177 --> 01:18:01,678
Why did you hide it?

672
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,765
A stupid reaction.

673
01:18:06,016 --> 01:18:07,601
Maybe, maybe I was...

674
01:18:08,477 --> 01:18:09,770
a little ashamed.

675
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:16,610
You knew she was coming home today?

676
01:18:16,777 --> 01:18:18,987
Yeah. She was coming back from Milan,

677
01:18:19,154 --> 01:18:20,906
and on her way to Marrakech.

678
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:25,035
I was dropping off some
accessories for her.

679
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,995
What accessories?

680
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:28,997
Jewellery.

681
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:31,083
What jewellery?

682
01:18:32,918 --> 01:18:35,921
Very expessive jewellery from Cartier.

683
01:18:37,339 --> 01:18:38,840
And you left it there?

684
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:44,346
Yeah. In four cases in two bags.

685
01:18:45,013 --> 01:18:46,723
Were they still there
when you went back?

686
01:18:48,141 --> 01:18:49,518
I-I-I don't know. I wasn't...

687
01:18:49,684 --> 01:18:52,479
I wasn't considering the jewellery
at that point...

688
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:54,356
I didn't notice.

689
01:19:03,657 --> 01:19:06,493
<i>Unknown: Did you tell the cops
about my texts?</i>

690
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:16,461
Unknown: ANSWER ME.

691
01:19:24,094 --> 01:19:27,389
<i>Unknown: DID YOU TELL THE COPS
ABOUT MY TEXTS?</i>

692
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:45,490
Sorry, if I woke you up.

693
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:49,035
<i>I was just stress-testing...</i>

694
01:19:49,578 --> 01:19:51,705
one of the new security protocols.

695
01:19:51,872 --> 01:19:53,915
<i>Really fucking hard to configure.</i>

696
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:55,667
<i>So, it's gonna take me a month.</i>

697
01:19:56,418 --> 01:19:57,627
<i>Best case.</i>

698
01:19:58,712 --> 01:20:00,172
I'm gonna come see you.

699
01:20:03,175 --> 01:20:04,384
<i>You giving up?</i>

700
01:20:06,303 --> 01:20:07,679
Yeah, it's not going to happen.

701
01:20:09,681 --> 01:20:12,100
<i>Maureen, it's not that
it isn't going to happen,</i>

702
01:20:12,267 --> 01:20:13,977
<i>it's that it doesn't exist.</i>

703
01:20:14,478 --> 01:20:15,854
<i>After death,</i>

704
01:20:16,521 --> 01:20:17,772
<i>there's nothing.</i>

705
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:18,899
I- I know.

706
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,110
<i>And it's not that big a deal.</i>

707
01:20:22,277 --> 01:20:24,946
You told me that you had a hope...

708
01:20:25,405 --> 01:20:27,115
Like you really hoped that...

709
01:20:27,282 --> 01:20:28,492
<i>Of course I do.</i>

710
01:20:30,118 --> 01:20:31,244
<i>But, no.</i>

711
01:20:31,995 --> 01:20:33,330
<i>I don't believe.</i>

712
01:20:35,457 --> 01:20:37,167
I don't want to be here anymore.

713
01:20:37,334 --> 01:20:39,461
I don't want to be in Paris anymore.

714
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:42,506
I miss you.

715
01:20:43,131 --> 01:20:44,716
<i>I miss you too.</i>

716
01:20:47,761 --> 01:20:50,597
<i>I'm actually heading up
the mountains for a few days.</i>

717
01:20:50,805 --> 01:20:53,850
<i>If you want to, you can come quickly
and meet me there.</i>

718
01:20:54,518 --> 01:20:56,061
Maybe...

719
01:20:56,603 --> 01:20:58,230
It really depends on what the police say.

720
01:20:58,396 --> 01:21:00,565
If the travel ban's been lifted or not.

721
01:21:00,732 --> 01:21:01,858
<i>The police?</i>

722
01:21:04,236 --> 01:21:06,225
Yeah, Kyra was murdered,
you didn't hear that?

723
01:21:06,226 --> 01:21:07,739
- It's everywhere. All over the news.
-What?

724
01:21:07,948 --> 01:21:09,407
- I found her.
- Murdered?

725
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:11,493
<i>Who murdered her?</i>

726
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:12,619
I don't know.

727
01:21:14,663 --> 01:21:16,957
It was really horr... It was, ah...

728
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:20,126
<i>Are you okay?</i>

729
01:21:22,087 --> 01:21:25,215
I can't talk about it.
It was fucking horrible.

730
01:21:29,094 --> 01:21:31,555
<i>You want me to call you back later?</i>

731
01:21:31,972 --> 01:21:32,847
I'll call you.

732
01:22:07,048 --> 01:22:09,426
<i>Unknown: Crowne Plaza. Room 329.
Right away.</i>

733
01:22:10,594 --> 01:22:12,387
<i>Unknown: I'll wait another hour.</i>

734
01:22:14,889 --> 01:22:17,183
<i>Unknown: I know you are reading my texts.
Come.</i>

735
01:22:17,434 --> 01:22:19,144
<i>Unknown: Then I'll come.</i>

736
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:22,022
<i>Unknown: I have spares of your keys.</i>

737
01:22:22,647 --> 01:22:24,232
<i>Unknown: I am in the taxi.</i>

738
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:26,318
<i>Unknown: I am in front of your building.</i>

739
01:22:28,778 --> 01:22:30,155
<i>Unknown: Come down.</i>

740
01:22:30,697 --> 01:22:32,073
<i>Unknown: Now.</i>

741
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:34,284
<i>Unknown: I am coming up.</i>

742
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:37,829
<i>Unknown: I am on the landing.</i>

743
01:26:31,604 --> 01:26:33,689
- You okay?
- Yeah

744
01:26:43,283 --> 01:26:46,243
- They... Can I have some?
- Yeah, sure.

745
01:26:50,373 --> 01:26:52,083
They arrested Ingo, and he...

746
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:55,420
and he confessed to everything.

747
01:26:57,297 --> 01:26:59,215
Did they lift the travel ban?

748
01:27:00,174 --> 01:27:01,718
Yeah. The case is closed.

749
01:27:03,386 --> 01:27:05,221
But you'll testify?

750
01:27:08,349 --> 01:27:09,684
Yes, yeah, probably.

751
01:27:12,937 --> 01:27:14,647
Do you want to come to my place?

752
01:27:16,065 --> 01:27:17,400
Yeah. I feel, um...

753
01:27:19,485 --> 01:27:20,945
I'm scared when I alone now.

754
01:27:21,988 --> 01:27:23,698
You're going to see Gary, right?

755
01:27:24,493 --> 01:27:26,493
Yes, Yep.

756
01:27:29,287 --> 01:27:31,122
You should have gone a while ago.

757
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:33,166
I should have listened to you.

758
01:27:35,126 --> 01:27:36,878
Let's go, I have my car.

759
01:28:05,584 --> 01:28:07,584
- Morning.
- Morning.

760
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:15,667
You're Lewis' sister?

761
01:28:19,045 --> 01:28:20,213
I am.

762
01:28:20,755 --> 01:28:22,590
We were together at l'École Boulle.

763
01:28:23,007 --> 01:28:25,677
Now I work at the Gobelin workshops.

764
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,639
Actually, I should get going soon.

765
01:28:30,598 --> 01:28:31,724
You should stay.

766
01:28:32,642 --> 01:28:33,643
If you can.

767
01:28:35,019 --> 01:28:36,437
- Maureen.
- Erwin.

768
01:28:36,604 --> 01:28:37,772
Both: Enchanté.

769
01:28:43,194 --> 01:28:45,488
I understand that you might
feel uncomfortable.

770
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,116
Why?

771
01:28:48,783 --> 01:28:51,536
Because I've taken Lewis' place.

772
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:53,037
So soon.

773
01:28:53,204 --> 01:28:54,330
Not at all.

774
01:28:55,164 --> 01:28:56,332
You're mistaken.

775
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:02,630
While he was alive,
there was nothing between Lara and me.

776
01:29:03,673 --> 01:29:06,467
It didn't cross my mind.
Honestly.

777
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:12,765
You know how they say,
the dead watch over the living?

778
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,727
I've thought about that quite a lot.

779
01:29:16,436 --> 01:29:19,147
Not just because Lewis was a medium.

780
01:29:19,897 --> 01:29:21,649
I don't know what that means.

781
01:29:23,735 --> 01:29:27,739
For me, he was someone
deeply intuitive of others.

782
01:29:29,907 --> 01:29:32,618
He understood things that went unspoken.

783
01:29:33,494 --> 01:29:34,495
He did.

784
01:29:35,997 --> 01:29:39,000
Maybe because he knew
he was going to die.

785
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:44,005
I mean I felt that he
saw things which I didn't.

786
01:29:46,924 --> 01:29:48,259
Maybe you do too.

787
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:51,721
He thought that you had the same gifts.

788
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:53,556
I don't know.

789
01:29:54,684 --> 01:29:57,463
I, ah..

790
01:29:57,464 --> 01:29:58,747
had a tendency to follow him.

791
01:30:00,188 --> 01:30:02,231
He took things quite far.

792
01:30:03,107 --> 01:30:05,276
Too far for me, at least.

793
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:07,028
I couldn't keep up.

794
01:30:07,945 --> 01:30:10,198
All I mean is that with Lewis,

795
01:30:11,032 --> 01:30:12,742
nothing seems impossible.

796
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:18,414
Many religions believe that
the soul wanders around for a while

797
01:30:18,581 --> 01:30:20,291
before leaving this world.

798
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:22,502
Did he speak to you about that?

799
01:30:22,668 --> 01:30:24,212
He was convinced of it.

800
01:30:32,386 --> 01:30:34,597
Years ago, Mum died,

801
01:30:34,931 --> 01:30:36,474
he was sure that...

802
01:30:37,809 --> 01:30:42,063
he was visited by her.
That she came to say goodbye to him.

803
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:46,192
That it felt like a dream,
but not, that it was very real.

804
01:30:46,359 --> 01:30:49,779
He could smell her,
he could see her so clearly...you know?

805
01:30:50,696 --> 01:30:51,906
Do you believe that?

806
01:30:52,573 --> 01:30:53,783
Yeah, I do.

807
01:30:55,034 --> 01:30:57,912
It's not a religion thing, but I...

808
01:30:59,038 --> 01:31:00,164
I do.

809
01:31:00,998 --> 01:31:02,792
Do you think Lewis is here?

810
01:31:11,342 --> 01:31:12,426
I don't think so.

811
01:31:16,264 --> 01:31:17,932
I feel his presence.

812
01:31:19,225 --> 01:31:20,184
He's here.

813
01:31:23,104 --> 01:31:25,565
That might be your guilt talking.

814
01:31:25,731 --> 01:31:28,067
You don't need to feel guilty.

815
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:32,238
Lara deserves to be happy.

816
01:31:32,572 --> 01:31:33,823
And you do too.

817
01:31:34,615 --> 01:31:36,325
I like to think so but...

818
01:31:37,785 --> 01:31:39,287
something is stopping me.

819
01:31:40,121 --> 01:31:42,039
- I hope it has nothing to do with me.
- No.

820
01:31:46,669 --> 01:31:49,130
But you also have to
free yourself of Lewis.

821
01:31:50,298 --> 01:31:52,133
Well, I wish he'd let me.

822
01:31:53,009 --> 01:31:54,343
Wherever he is,

823
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:56,095
he would never forbid it.

824
01:31:57,805 --> 01:32:00,099
And even if he's nowhere,

825
01:32:00,516 --> 01:32:02,435
hold onto the memory of his freedom.

826
01:32:03,853 --> 01:32:05,229
Put it into practice.

827
01:32:15,781 --> 01:32:17,450
I know what you mean.

828
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:20,411
You know, I have to get going.

829
01:32:22,705 --> 01:32:24,540
Will you be staying a few days?

830
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:27,543
Just tonight. I leave tomorrow.

831
01:32:28,002 --> 01:32:30,587
- So, I'll see you tonight.
- Okay

832
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

833
01:33:45,288 --> 01:33:46,914
Uhh, uhh uhh. Good boy.

834
01:33:52,253 --> 01:33:53,504
What happend?

835
01:33:53,963 --> 01:33:55,131
A glass broke.

836
01:33:55,506 --> 01:33:57,091
I thought you were outside?

837
01:33:57,258 --> 01:33:58,592
Erwin just left.

838
01:33:58,759 --> 01:34:00,720
He must have left it on the edge
of the table, or something.

839
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,827
<i>I hope you had a good trip.</i>

840
01:35:06,994 --> 01:35:08,371
<i>Get some rest.</i>

841
01:35:09,121 --> 01:35:11,165
<i>Your driver is named Salim.</i>

842
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:14,043
<i>It's best to leave a little
before daybreak.</i>

843
01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:16,796
<i>Count on a five hour ride.</i>

844
01:35:16,962 --> 01:35:20,007
<i>Don't worry, the road is safe,
even if it is not very busy.</i>

845
01:35:20,383 --> 01:35:23,219
<i>Take the minimum.
I have everything we need.</i>

846
01:35:23,386 --> 01:35:25,096
<i>In other words, not much.</i>

847
01:35:25,471 --> 01:35:28,557
<i>If it's okay with you,
we'll stay for a week.</i>

848
01:35:29,433 --> 01:35:32,019
<i>You'll have to be tolerant,
it's spartan.</i>

849
01:35:32,645 --> 01:35:34,605
<i>But you told me this is what you wanted.</i>

850
01:37:12,369 --> 01:37:13,569
Haiji?

851
01:37:41,732 --> 01:37:42,650
Lewis?

852
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

853
01:37:51,784 --> 01:37:52,910
Are you here?

854
01:38:05,673 --> 01:38:07,174
Have you been waiting for me?

855
01:38:30,155 --> 01:38:31,490
Are you at peace?

856
01:38:45,838 --> 01:38:46,880
Thank you.

857
01:39:08,402 --> 01:39:09,945
Are you not at peace?

858
01:39:25,461 --> 01:39:26,837
Are you playing with me?

859
01:39:36,472 --> 01:39:38,140
Do you mean harm?

860
01:39:45,689 --> 01:39:47,066
I don't know you.

861
01:39:56,909 --> 01:39:58,118
Who are you?

862
01:40:00,871 --> 01:40:02,081
Who are you?

863
01:40:17,262 --> 01:40:18,639
Lewis, is it you?

864
01:40:19,932 --> 01:40:21,517
Lewis, is it you?

865
01:40:35,072 --> 01:40:36,615
Or is it just me?
