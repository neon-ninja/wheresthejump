1
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,977
Jeff, give me a two-shot.

2
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:09,474
Here's a bulletin from Washington.

3
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:12,277
I just feel as if everything
is out of my control.

4
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,578
I've got an animal head right there.

5
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,378
Do you know what did it?

6
00:01:20,784 --> 00:01:23,478
We say it's the only way to look terrific.

7
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,879
- He understands all about the gifts.
...recent string of fatal attacks.

8
00:01:31,152 --> 00:01:33,511
This next one coming up is in the park.

9
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:36,140
It's the second victim.

10
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:45,210
She's ours.

11
00:01:48,252 --> 00:01:51,307
Now with this film out,
the public is dying to see her.

12
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:54,671
It's for real.

13
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:04,917
...Dr. George Waggner explains
on a special edition of Perspective.

14
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:06,040
You can take it out.

15
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:08,841
We saw pictures
just like we saw in his room.

16
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:19,809
It is, after all, what we are.

17
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:21,941
...TV, Channel 6, Los Angeles.

18
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:23,143
Repression.

19
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:27,111
Repression is the father of neurosis...

20
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:28,978
of self-hatred.

21
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:34,044
Stress results
when we fight against our impulses.

22
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:39,209
We've all heard people talk about
animal magnetism...

23
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:41,210
the natural man...

24
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:44,073
the noble savage...

25
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:46,975
as if we'd lost something valuable...

26
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:49,974
in our long evolution
into civilized human beings.

27
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:52,039
There's a good reason for this.

28
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:54,343
Man is a combination...

29
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:59,341
of the learned and the instinctual,
of the sophisticated and the primitive.

30
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:03,546
We should never try to deny the beast...

31
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,439
the animal within us.

32
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,577
- The minute anything breaks, cut to Chris.
- Before Doc pitches his book?

33
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,673
Hell, he's been coaching Karen on
how to talk to this psycho. He won't mind.

34
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:21,937
How much?

35
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,847
How much for a half and half?

36
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:29,843
Sorry, but excuse me.

37
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:32,477
Excuse me.

38
00:03:34,418 --> 00:03:37,214
- You're that TV lady, ain't you?
- Yeah, buzz off.

39
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:40,104
Jesus.

40
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,109
- Did Karen see this?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,444
Oh, shit.

42
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:48,205
She never even mentioned
seeing the victims.

43
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:50,183
She didn't want you to worry.

44
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:54,975
I'm worried.

45
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:08,279
Okay, guys, this is the jackpot.

46
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:12,182
I'm on Western between...

47
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:15,909
I'll transmit as soon as Eddie calls.

48
00:04:15,982 --> 00:04:19,212
- I don't like the interference.
- It's the best rig we got.

49
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:22,980
No, it's all that neon out there.
It messes up the signal.

50
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:25,507
I'll get our people to cruise Western.

51
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:29,380
Boy, there's a lot of
flotsam and jetsam out tonight, ain't there?

52
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:32,514
Seems like there's more of them
every time I get out here.

53
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:37,273
I wonder where they come from,
where they're going to.

54
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:41,139
I don't know where they're from,
but they got to where they're going.

55
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:43,209
...six, David Jail, 1455.

56
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:46,117
Contact lost with Fox 1.
Vicinity: Western and DeLongpre.

57
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,976
Report any sighting.
Repeat, report any sighting.

58
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:55,946
She's wearing a purple and lavender outfit.
We'll be able to spot her pretty easy.

59
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:58,208
Yeah, I've seen her on the news.

60
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:01,877
"Weeks ago,
when Update News reporter Karen White...

61
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,612
"began receiving calls from a mysterious
stranger, identifying himself only as Eddie...

62
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,944
"the KDHB News team..." No.

63
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:13,643
"The KDHB News team began working...

64
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:17,016
"The KDHB News team
began working with local police...

65
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,675
"to link Eddie with a recent string of..."

66
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:23,176
Hi, Bill.

67
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:30,777
That's a brave li'l ol' girl you've got there.

68
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:46,913
"Tonight, in an act of courage,
we here at KDHB...

69
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:48,814
"are all very proud of..."

70
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:50,512
Good evening.

71
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,576
- Terry, how are you?
- Good. How's it going?

72
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:55,944
I'll need a few more minutes.

73
00:06:01,282 --> 00:06:04,181
Jesus, there's a guy standing
right outside the booth now.

74
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,647
I don't know if it's him or not.

75
00:06:05,716 --> 00:06:08,306
Lieutenant Shantz, Detective Kline...

76
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:10,642
this is Karen's husband.

77
00:06:10,716 --> 00:06:13,444
You've got quite a brave young lady there,
Mr. White.

78
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:16,679
Neill, Bill Neill.
My wife uses her maiden name.

79
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,579
Bill Neill. Stanford, right?

80
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:22,038
So how is it going?

81
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,445
I have not got a clean word from Karen
in the last 15 minutes.

82
00:06:25,516 --> 00:06:26,642
15 minutes?

83
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:33,708
Hello.

84
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:35,647
Hold it. She's transmitting.

85
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:39,481
Come on, Eddie. I know that it's you.

86
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,549
Yeah, I'm alone.

87
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:46,711
Are you wearing what I asked you to?

88
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:50,706
Good.

89
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,948
Where's the sound?

90
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,646
- That's it.
- What?

91
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:03,738
I'm afraid we might've lost her.

92
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:07,106
Lost her?

93
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:10,182
What the hell kind of
half-assed operation is this?

94
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,779
Okay, Eddie, I'll be there
in just a little while.

95
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:22,616
Okay, mister, it's all yours.

96
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:34,578
You said you'd never be out of contact.
What kind of operation are you running?

97
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:38,105
- They have people in the area...
- What does that mean, "in the area"?

98
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:39,618
They will find her!

99
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:06,147
Okay, guys, this is it.
I'll keep the transmitter open.

100
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:33,978
- Hello, Eddie.
- I knew you'd come, Karen.

101
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:37,705
We have a lot to talk about, you and me.

102
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,245
- Can I turn around and see you?
- Not yet, Karen.

103
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:51,144
Just watch.

104
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:56,740
- Yeah, she asked me directions to it.
- How long ago?

105
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:58,304
A couple of minutes.

106
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:01,575
The struggle between mind and body...

107
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:04,315
is not a necessary one.

108
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:08,346
It produces anger, frustration,
the strain of modern-day living...

109
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:11,383
in a world that is moving too quickly.

110
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,245
Three minutes to commercial.

111
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:16,410
Two, push in to a single on the doctor.

112
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:19,576
All of us have a great
untapped potential for living.

113
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,744
Waiting is tough.

114
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:26,582
...depends as much on our attitudes
toward our physical lives...

115
00:10:26,654 --> 00:10:28,415
Ready 1. Take 1.

116
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:31,779
...as it does on the social programming
of our minds.

117
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:37,782
When we are born, each of us is given a gift.

118
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:40,615
The gift of life.

119
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:43,717
Camera 2, give me a two-shot.

120
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,082
She didn't feel a thing, Karen.
None of them do.

121
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,515
They're not real, the people here.
They're dead.

122
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,414
They could never be like me.

123
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:57,084
But you're different, Karen.

124
00:10:57,352 --> 00:10:58,716
I watch you on TV.

125
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:02,713
And I know how good I can make you feel.

126
00:11:04,485 --> 00:11:06,779
I'm going to light up your whole body.

127
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:20,313
Turn around now, Karen.

128
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,947
I want to give you something.

129
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:39,612
There's a broad that came in here.
She emptied the place out.

130
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:41,375
She's watching movies.

131
00:11:47,252 --> 00:11:48,239
Please!

132
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:00,550
My God, Jesus Christ!

133
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:04,477
Put your piece away!

134
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:10,780
I knew I shouldn't have let
that broad back here.

135
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:12,880
Go to remote. Take it.

136
00:12:19,483 --> 00:12:21,880
A reign of urban terror ended early tonight...

137
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,108
in a bizarre shoot-out
at a Western Avenue...

138
00:12:24,183 --> 00:12:27,081
No knife, no gun, no nothing.
The freak was clean.

139
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,877
What happened back there?

140
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:31,474
Don't ask me, Lieutenant.
Ask Quick Draw McGraw.

141
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,643
...died in an attempted assault
of KDHB anchorwoman Karen White...

142
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:37,682
who'd been receiving calls from him...

143
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,410
in connection with the recent series
of brutal murders in the downtown area.

144
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:43,245
It's me. Are you all right?

145
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,739
It's okay. We can go home in a few minutes.

146
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:56,647
I talked the old man
out of putting you on camera tonight.

147
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:57,945
That was big of you.

148
00:12:58,018 --> 00:13:01,041
We'll tape something later on,
when you feel up to it.

149
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,148
I don't know...

150
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,752
Whatever happened, in your own words.
Nothing newsy.

151
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:12,341
I don't know what happened in there.

152
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:18,243
I don't remember.

153
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,679
Please, don't do it!

154
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,676
It's me, Bill. It's all right.

155
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:27,440
I didn't even see him.

156
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:30,608
I turned around, but I didn't see him.

157
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:56,847
- It's Number 27, down the hall.
- Thank you.

158
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:00,047
Did the guy say anything else?

159
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,747
He just said he worked with a kid
named Eddie, that he thought lived here.

160
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,111
- He did say the kid hated washing dishes.
- Who doesn't?

161
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:10,442
Here we go.

162
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:22,773
Charming.

163
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:31,772
Oh, God.

164
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's just your average, red-blooded,
all-American boy.

165
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:51,613
Get out of here!

166
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:58,974
Boy, Doc's gonna have a field day
with these.

167
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:02,175
Karen.

168
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,144
Look at this.

169
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:08,581
Not bad. The kid had talent.

170
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:14,073
He could've designed
the Marquis de Sade coloring book.

171
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:37,576
I think we better call the cops.

172
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:39,176
Eventually.

173
00:16:39,953 --> 00:16:41,180
Look at this.

174
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:48,274
I wonder if this is a real place.

175
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:52,413
So what's the story
on our next Norman Rockwell?

176
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:56,773
This sort of person is controlled
by the right hemisphere of the brain.

177
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,283
That dominates the non-rational...

178
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:03,811
the artistic, the creative impulses.

179
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,982
It's not unusual
for a killer to draw as well as that.

180
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:12,779
It's not a bad angle, Doc.
Do you mind putting that on tape for us?

181
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:13,943
Not at all.

182
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:18,144
We're pushing Fred for a half-hour special
called The Mind of Eddie Quist...

183
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:21,080
although we're focusing, really,
on the beast in all of us.

184
00:17:21,183 --> 00:17:22,274
Good idea.

185
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:25,179
- So you found the last name?
- He signed his work.

186
00:17:29,885 --> 00:17:30,977
So he did.

187
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,583
I'm sorry.

188
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,441
I guess I'm just not quite ready yet, okay?

189
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:43,813
You'll be okay.

190
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:45,875
Don't worry.

191
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,175
Stand by, Cameras 1 and 2.

192
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:03,273
- Then I'm on the air.
- 2, push on in.

193
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,143
Are you sure you're up to this?

194
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,810
- Nothing like diving in head first.
- That's what the old man says.

195
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:11,384
Here's our girl.

196
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:17,711
We're gonna make ratings history tonight.
You'll be the cynosure of all eyes.

197
00:18:17,784 --> 00:18:20,307
That means everybody
is going to be watching you.

198
00:18:20,385 --> 00:18:23,682
Everybody wants to see
the lady who caught Eddie the Mangler.

199
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,842
Terrific. You have my copy?

200
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:27,710
Good luck.

201
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:30,876
- Boy, she seems shaky.
- Looks fine to me.

202
00:18:31,187 --> 00:18:34,707
- We go in 10 seconds.
- Don't let this be the last stop for your car.

203
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:39,548
- Keep your runabout running right...
- Five, four, three...

204
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:42,881
This is KDHB TV, Channel 6, Los Angeles.

205
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:44,040
Up on 2.

206
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:49,108
It's the 5:00 edition
of the Southland's top-rated newscast...

207
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:52,374
the Channel 6 Update News,
featuring Lew Landers and Karen White...

208
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:55,538
with the late-breaking headlines,
Gene Codler with sports...

209
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:56,876
John Rob with the weather...

210
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:58,313
Ready, Camera 2.

211
00:18:59,982 --> 00:19:02,450
Are the tapes on that train wreck ready?

212
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:07,811
...14 injured in train derailment.
More on the Mideast earthquake.

213
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:15,047
Karen White's exclusive eyewitness account
of the police shooting...

214
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:18,085
of the key suspect
in the Eddie-the-Mangler slayings.

215
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:20,611
Now, here's Karen White.

216
00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:23,944
Good evening.

217
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:47,371
Get her out of there.

218
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:50,916
- Roll 7.
- Cue the editorial.

219
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:56,143
...proclaimed no immediate danger
to nearby residential areas.

220
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:02,647
Let's pause now for an editorial
from our General Manager, Fred W. Francis.

221
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:04,374
Here's Fred.

222
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:08,707
In keeping with this station's pledge
of community involvement...

223
00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:12,444
we present an editorial
from KDHB station manager, Fred Francis.

224
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:17,942
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right. You need a little more time.

225
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:23,204
There's been a lot of talk in the past month
about our culture of violence.

226
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:25,081
Who knows? Maybe she's pregnant.

227
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:28,773
Get in touch with Fujiama, Fujimoto,
or whatever the hell her name is...

228
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:31,214
and get her ready for the 11:00 report.

229
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,912
Now there is a pro.

230
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,846
You can't be afraid of dreams.

231
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:43,743
I can't help it. All I remember...

232
00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:46,476
is pushing open the door...

233
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:50,549
and then I'm outside...

234
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:55,346
and the police are there, Bill's there,
and the remote crew, and it's over.

235
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:03,347
There's blood on me, and I can't imagine
who it might have came from.

236
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:07,080
You can't remember
anything that happened inside the booth?

237
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:10,574
No, not really.

238
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:13,677
Just weird little pieces in my dreams.

239
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:18,303
How're you and Bill?

240
00:21:19,182 --> 00:21:20,738
Trying to communicate.

241
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,547
- Tell me, Doctor, how crazy am I?
- Completely bananas.

242
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:29,574
I think so.

243
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:33,136
I recommend that you go out to the Colony
for a week or two.

244
00:21:33,982 --> 00:21:36,504
- Your place up north there?
- That's right.

245
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:39,378
I only recommend it
to very special patients...

246
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:42,008
ones who I think will benefit
from its environment.

247
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,607
It's a place where you can
recharge your batteries.

248
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:48,048
It'll enable you to try and get back
to what you really are.

249
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:50,346
What goes on up there?

250
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:54,316
Seminars, group therapy. It's very low-key.

251
00:21:54,717 --> 00:21:57,843
It'll be a good place
to try and tackle this amnesia thing.

252
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,810
I don't know if I want to remember.

253
00:22:02,684 --> 00:22:03,672
What?

254
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:08,812
Doc said, once I remembered what
happened, it wouldn't scare me anymore.

255
00:22:08,881 --> 00:22:10,245
I'm not so sure.

256
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:13,443
Honey, give this place a chance, okay?

257
00:22:14,214 --> 00:22:15,841
We've got to do something.

258
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:19,445
I hope these people aren't too weird.

259
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:37,244
Jerry Warren, softwares.

260
00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:39,812
Bill Neill, hardware.

261
00:22:40,052 --> 00:22:41,038
Hardware?

262
00:22:41,217 --> 00:22:42,612
He doesn't get it, Bill.

263
00:22:42,682 --> 00:22:46,171
I own a couple of health clubs, barbells,
hardware. This is my wife Karen.

264
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:48,112
Hi, nice to meet you.

265
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:50,809
- Prime rib?
- No, I try to stay away from meat.

266
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:53,112
- Maybe later. Thank you.
- Thank you.

267
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,673
Did you see that meat?

268
00:22:57,718 --> 00:23:00,612
Oh, my God!
We watch you on the news all the time.

269
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:02,973
You're our second favorite...

270
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,484
right behind...
What's the name of that Oriental girl, Jerry?

271
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,379
This is my wife, Donna.

272
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:13,538
- Get me out of here, Bill.
- Looky here!

273
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:15,345
Welcome to the Colony!

274
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:19,113
Charlie Barton, Bill and Karen...

275
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:21,146
- White.
- Neill.

276
00:23:21,214 --> 00:23:25,148
Charlie's on our board. He put up
all the cattle for tonight's barbecue.

277
00:23:25,483 --> 00:23:27,711
I seen you on television!

278
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,341
Thank you.

279
00:23:31,051 --> 00:23:33,745
If you fellows don't mind,
I'm going to borrow Karen...

280
00:23:33,818 --> 00:23:36,113
and give her the run-down on the Colony.

281
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:38,374
- Don't leave out the juicy stuff.
- I won't.

282
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:39,676
Come on.

283
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:43,376
- Let's get this boy some bacon.
- You say when now, Bill.

284
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:08,576
Can't go on like this.

285
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,473
Damn teeth are shot.

286
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,212
Hell of a note.

287
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:24,980
You want some?

288
00:24:25,653 --> 00:24:27,141
Sure, why not?

289
00:24:28,451 --> 00:24:29,678
What's in it?

290
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:34,741
It's good.

291
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,339
I'm Bill.

292
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:39,074
I know.

293
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:43,540
I'm looking for my wife.

294
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:48,572
Why?

295
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,406
Excuse me.

296
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,845
...opening up and letting it all come out.

297
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:08,643
I've found parts of me
I didn't even know existed.

298
00:25:08,714 --> 00:25:12,241
Now you can see why I brought you here.
You won't be cold here.

299
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:16,875
- Speaking of cold, how is your bungalow?
- It's quite nice, thanks.

300
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:19,179
- We're neighbors.
- You are?

301
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:24,174
Tell me something else.
Do you miss the television?

302
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:27,214
Are you kidding?
I don't have to pin my hair up.

303
00:25:27,214 --> 00:25:27,577
Are you kidding?
I don't have to pin my hair up.

304
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:38,075
Hello, Marsha. How are you?

305
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:41,740
Take this book back.
I don't want my brother reading it.

306
00:25:42,646 --> 00:25:44,578
I think he said he'd like to.

307
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:47,272
You've done enough damage already.

308
00:25:56,882 --> 00:25:58,814
- Bitch.
- No.

309
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:01,900
We can all learn a great deal from Marsha.

310
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:04,376
She's a very elemental person.

311
00:26:04,945 --> 00:26:06,845
It's all that natural energy.

312
00:26:07,547 --> 00:26:09,070
She's a nymphomaniac.

313
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:15,345
It's just that it's so unchanneled.

314
00:26:16,748 --> 00:26:18,474
She has a long way to go.

315
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:20,614
Let me go! I want to end it!

316
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,307
Easy, buddy, just calm down.

317
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:25,143
This is the only way.
I got to end it, I got to burn!

318
00:27:25,216 --> 00:27:27,579
Calm down. Think a minute.

319
00:27:28,317 --> 00:27:30,403
You got to let me do it, Doc.

320
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:33,376
- Jesus.
- Don't worry.

321
00:27:34,481 --> 00:27:38,412
That's one of Erle's favorite tricks.
He's just trying to get attention.

322
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,844
I want to end it. It just goes on and on.

323
00:27:41,914 --> 00:27:43,710
You know better than that.

324
00:27:43,783 --> 00:27:46,872
The old man shouldn't drink.
It really gets him loose.

325
00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:50,507
Believe me, come tomorrow...

326
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:53,942
people will be so pleased
to see that you're safe and sound...

327
00:27:54,015 --> 00:27:56,037
they won't think anything more of it.

328
00:27:56,114 --> 00:27:57,978
You get a good night's sleep.

329
00:27:58,182 --> 00:28:00,910
Everything will seem better
in the light of day.

330
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:03,341
There, now.

331
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:18,240
Bill, wake up, there's something out there!

332
00:29:18,312 --> 00:29:20,302
Outside. Something was howling.

333
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,306
- Listen.
- The wind.

334
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,608
There was something howling before.

335
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:32,911
Okay, sure. Somebody's dog.

336
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:35,769
Not like any dog I ever heard.

337
00:29:36,378 --> 00:29:37,867
Honey, you were raised in L.A.

338
00:29:37,947 --> 00:29:40,277
The wildest thing you ever heard
was Wolfman Jack.

339
00:29:40,347 --> 00:29:41,836
This is the country.

340
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:44,540
Come on, let's try to get some sleep, okay?

341
00:29:46,815 --> 00:29:47,805
Good.

342
00:31:26,414 --> 00:31:29,846
You heard something outside.
Why shouldn't you call the police?

343
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:34,277
I'm embarrassed.
I wish we hadn't even called them.

344
00:31:34,346 --> 00:31:37,676
Look at this!
All the balls on my side of the court again.

345
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:40,870
What you ladies need is a good retriever.

346
00:31:44,113 --> 00:31:48,046
Doc said on the phone that you folks
had a coyote problem out here.

347
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:51,070
- You're famous, ain't you?
- Sort of.

348
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:54,238
Sam, this is Karen White.
Karen, Sam Newfield.

349
00:31:54,316 --> 00:31:57,674
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- I used to watch you all the time.

350
00:31:58,076 --> 00:32:00,633
You're prettier than Walter Cronkite.

351
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:04,540
Karen thought she saw something moving
in the bushes last night.

352
00:32:05,144 --> 00:32:09,544
Coyotes is liable to come into a setup
like this to look for garbage.

353
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:11,908
- Did you hear anything?
- Me?

354
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:14,440
I sleep like the dead.

355
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:18,644
Tattoo? I don't remember one on him
when he came in.

356
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,306
The coroner...

357
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:23,101
The coroner said
that he had one on his shoulder.

358
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:25,738
Some kind of animal head, right there.

359
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:29,571
I don't get many of you TV people in here.

360
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:33,406
Mostly it's the newspaper guys
who like to come in, look at the meat.

361
00:32:33,612 --> 00:32:35,735
I don't know how you can stand it.

362
00:32:36,045 --> 00:32:38,602
Doesn't bother me.
Want to unwrap him, Ross?

363
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:43,512
Let's see, Quist is still with the John Does.
We haven't had time to re-file him.

364
00:32:43,914 --> 00:32:46,538
Only thing that freaked me out
since working here...

365
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:48,410
is the night old Stu Walker came in.

366
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,340
The guy who worked here.
I say goodnight to him at the shift change...

367
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:56,174
a couple hours go by, then we get a delivery
from the Oceanside unit.

368
00:32:56,312 --> 00:32:57,708
I unzip the bag.

369
00:32:57,876 --> 00:33:01,833
There's old Stu, smiling up at me,
leaking sea water out his ears.

370
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:04,343
Visitors, Eddie!

371
00:33:06,447 --> 00:33:07,607
Where is he?

372
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:10,173
He was here this morning.

373
00:33:10,944 --> 00:33:12,535
God! Look at the door.

374
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:16,437
You don't suppose somebody
could have stolen him, do you?

375
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:18,977
He didn't get up and walk out on his own.

376
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:28,539
There're cows around here?

377
00:33:29,078 --> 00:33:32,841
Charlie Barton's got a couple of acres
of pasture just down the hill.

378
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,239
They don't sound right.

379
00:33:38,546 --> 00:33:41,445
I'm not really sure
how cows are supposed to sound.

380
00:33:43,915 --> 00:33:45,171
Not like that.

381
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,467
Jerry's got a rifle, doesn't he?

382
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:55,839
Haven't you done assertiveness training?

383
00:33:57,645 --> 00:34:00,239
Before I hooked into Doc, I did it all.

384
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:04,309
I did EST, TM, Scientology...

385
00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:06,741
iridology, primal screamers.

386
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10,979
I don't know. I figure
another five years of real hard work...

387
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:13,069
and maybe I'll be a human being.

388
00:34:15,314 --> 00:34:16,804
I don't see nothing.

389
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,540
I didn't hear anything so funny anyway.

390
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,770
- Oh, Jesus!
- Christ!

391
00:34:28,581 --> 00:34:30,276
- Now what?
- What's wrong?

392
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:32,846
- Great!
- What's wrong?

393
00:34:33,247 --> 00:34:36,237
- What's wrong?
- Let me look at it. Let me see.

394
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:40,373
Here. I can tell about batteries.

395
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:47,103
God, Donna. Now we're stuck out here
in the middle of Timbuktu someplace!

396
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,774
- Watch that gun.
- God!

397
00:34:50,847 --> 00:34:53,678
Sorry to scare you, ma'am.
I thought you was a cowjacker.

398
00:34:53,746 --> 00:34:56,609
There's another one back up yonder,
tore up the same way.

399
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,202
- You know what did it?
- It ain't a coyote, that's a cinch.

400
00:35:00,444 --> 00:35:01,775
You girls all right?

401
00:35:02,945 --> 00:35:05,412
Nothing like a quiet week in the country.

402
00:35:08,514 --> 00:35:10,004
A little straighter.

403
00:35:11,082 --> 00:35:13,809
All right, now the quick shot again.
Think fast.

404
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:17,438
You have potential, Bill.

405
00:35:18,313 --> 00:35:20,677
I think you're ready for your bullets.

406
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:24,107
Don't you guys usually use a dog
in this kind of hunt?

407
00:35:24,182 --> 00:35:27,044
Usually. But these clowns
would shoot all of them.

408
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:29,940
Besides, who needs dogs? We got T.C.

409
00:35:31,615 --> 00:35:33,405
That boy's part bloodhound.

410
00:35:33,778 --> 00:35:37,836
I still think it was UFOs,
them cattle mutilations.

411
00:35:37,912 --> 00:35:42,038
Good, Erle. You watch the skies for us now.
That'll be your job.

412
00:35:42,112 --> 00:35:45,237
- I want to talk to you.
- I thought you had a session.

413
00:35:45,313 --> 00:35:48,838
I do. But I don't want you to go do this,
not just for my sake.

414
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,276
Are you kidding?

415
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:56,472
- I've never been on a wolf hunt before.
- This is a wolf hunt, not a coot show.

416
00:35:56,878 --> 00:35:59,209
The boys are calling me.
Do you see the boys?

417
00:36:34,045 --> 00:36:35,773
What happened then, Karen?

418
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:38,036
I hear something else.

419
00:36:38,478 --> 00:36:41,309
Somebody else is breathing,
he's in there with me.

420
00:36:42,148 --> 00:36:45,111
It's Eddie, and he closes the door.

421
00:36:45,612 --> 00:36:47,771
And he puts a quarter into the slot.

422
00:36:48,312 --> 00:36:50,245
And the movie starts.

423
00:36:52,146 --> 00:36:54,740
And then he whispers something to me.

424
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,078
He whispers something to me,
and then he tells me...

425
00:37:01,578 --> 00:37:04,068
I can finally turn around and look at him.

426
00:37:04,246 --> 00:37:05,712
Turn around, Karen.

427
00:37:06,213 --> 00:37:07,578
What do you see?

428
00:37:09,013 --> 00:37:10,503
What's there, Karen?

429
00:37:11,149 --> 00:37:13,772
- What do you see?
- What's there?

430
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- I can't see him.
- Just try. He's right there.
- What do you see?
- What's there?

431
00:37:23,145 --> 00:37:25,509
I can't see him! I can't.

432
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Okay. That's far enough for now.
I'm sorry.

433
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,103
I got him. First shot.

434
00:37:47,146 --> 00:37:49,170
And he said he wasn't no hunter.

435
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,545
We get 'em all:

436
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:16,400
sun worshippers,
moon worshippers, Satanists.

437
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:19,474
The Manson people
used to hang around here and shoplift.

438
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:20,737
Bunch of deadbeats.

439
00:38:20,811 --> 00:38:23,972
Do you know of any groups
that are into stealing corpses?

440
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:25,341
Body snatching?

441
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:29,243
If you want to read about it, I've got a book.
Slide me down.

442
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:32,832
Hold it.

443
00:38:34,276 --> 00:38:36,401
You name it, I've got the book.

444
00:38:36,978 --> 00:38:39,946
"A number of young women
were killed in the next month...

445
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:43,035
"their bodies exhibiting signs
of animal attack."

446
00:38:43,546 --> 00:38:44,707
What's that?

447
00:38:45,815 --> 00:38:47,869
Warlocks, Werewolves and Demons.

448
00:38:55,012 --> 00:38:59,378
If you're going to purchase, purchase.
If not, leave them. You'll get them greasy.

449
00:38:59,647 --> 00:39:02,511
We'll find out if any of Eddie's killings
were on a full moon.

450
00:39:02,581 --> 00:39:04,512
That's a lot of Hollywood baloney.

451
00:39:04,581 --> 00:39:08,032
Your classic werewolf can change shape
any time it wants, day or night.

452
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:11,510
That's why they're called shape-shifters.
I've got a dozen books on it.

453
00:39:11,578 --> 00:39:15,135
- What about killing it with silver bullets?
- Sure, silver bullets or fire.

454
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:18,700
It's the only way to get rid of them.
They're worse than cockroaches.

455
00:39:18,777 --> 00:39:21,439
They come back from the dead
if you don't kill them right.

456
00:39:21,513 --> 00:39:22,844
Plus, they regenerate.

457
00:39:22,913 --> 00:39:25,605
Cut off an arm or leg,
stick a knife in the heart. Nothing.

458
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:28,507
They look dead,
but three days later, they're as good as new.

459
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:31,339
- Do you believe in this?
- What am I, an idiot?

460
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,741
I'm making a buck here.
You want books, I got books.

461
00:39:33,812 --> 00:39:36,905
I got chicken blood, I got dog embryos,
black candles, wolfsbane.

462
00:39:36,981 --> 00:39:39,173
Look at this, silver bullets.

463
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:42,212
Some joker ordered them.
.30-06. Never picked them up.

464
00:39:43,244 --> 00:39:45,575
I take BankAmericard,
American Express, Visa.

465
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:48,272
- You gonna buy that or what?
- Yeah, these two.

466
00:39:49,647 --> 00:39:52,943
- There's some incredible old pictures here.
- That's a good book.

467
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,772
Did you see any wolves?

468
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:01,009
Nope. Just lots of rabbits.

469
00:40:01,677 --> 00:40:04,268
- What do you do with these things?
- Eat 'em.

470
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:08,505
My sister will cook it up for you, if you want.

471
00:40:08,812 --> 00:40:10,903
No, I try to stay away from meat.

472
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:12,802
Your wife might like it.

473
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,779
You kill something you don't eat.
Now, that's a sin.

474
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,999
I never thought of it like that.

475
00:40:19,078 --> 00:40:21,066
Our place is just over there.

476
00:40:21,143 --> 00:40:23,768
My sister would be glad
to cook it up for you.

477
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:26,940
Are you sure?

478
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,941
Marsha just loves to cook.

479
00:40:39,011 --> 00:40:40,238
Are you sure?

480
00:41:07,514 --> 00:41:09,104
How long will it take?

481
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:15,175
I'll cook it later.

482
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

483
00:43:02,711 --> 00:43:05,735
It happened so fast
that I didn't even see what it was.

484
00:43:05,812 --> 00:43:09,372
- Jesus, Doc, is that necessary?
- Can't take any chances.

485
00:43:10,981 --> 00:43:11,968
God!

486
00:43:13,815 --> 00:43:15,210
I want to go home.

487
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,567
I wouldn't advise traveling right now.

488
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:21,344
A bite like that can be pretty serious.

489
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,998
- Yes, that's the sign of the werewolf.
- That's just a legend though, isn't it?

490
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:31,975
Yes, but like most legends,
it must have some basis in fact.

491
00:43:32,045 --> 00:43:35,939
Probably an ancient explanation
of the dual personality in each of us.

492
00:43:36,274 --> 00:43:37,570
How does it go?

493
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:41,674
"Even a man pure in heart
and says his prayers by night...

494
00:43:41,742 --> 00:43:44,730
"may become a wolf
when the wolfsbane blooms...

495
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:46,866
"and the autumn moon is bright."

496
00:43:47,311 --> 00:43:49,208
You're reading. I'll get it.

497
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,606
- Who's calling at 11:30?
- It's my phone, I'll get it.

498
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,367
I'll get it.

499
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,032
- You want me to get it?
- You get it!

500
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:06,077
No, we're still up.

501
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:07,900
What?

502
00:44:09,376 --> 00:44:13,034
You're kidding me.
No, listen, we'll come right up, okay?

503
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,069
We'll be right up. Just calm down.

504
00:44:16,777 --> 00:44:18,334
Okay. Bye-bye.

505
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:19,969
What is it?

506
00:44:21,212 --> 00:44:23,199
Bill just got bitten by a wolf.

507
00:44:24,544 --> 00:44:27,410
...whoever is bitten
by a werewolf and lives...

508
00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:29,539
becomes a werewolf himself.

509
00:44:30,641 --> 00:44:32,869
Come on, Terry, it's only a movie.

510
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:37,405
You go on ahead and I'll be up as soon as
I pitch the special to the old man.

511
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:40,441
Relax, will you?
It was probably just some stray dog.

512
00:44:41,143 --> 00:44:43,007
- Hello, good friend.
- Hello.

513
00:44:43,077 --> 00:44:44,339
How are you?

514
00:44:44,411 --> 00:44:45,638
Are you okay?

515
00:44:47,275 --> 00:44:51,797
I don't know what her last name is.
Donna calls her Marsha the Man-Eater.

516
00:44:52,808 --> 00:44:55,606
And she lives in this shack...

517
00:44:55,976 --> 00:44:58,807
with these furry little animals
hanging from the rafters.

518
00:44:58,978 --> 00:45:01,911
You think she's trying
to make the move on Bill?

519
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:04,665
I don't know. It's just a feeling.

520
00:45:05,575 --> 00:45:07,303
I sound paranoid, don't I?

521
00:45:10,177 --> 00:45:12,040
Karen, you sound fine.

522
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:17,433
God, no veggies.
I totally forgot about Bill and his dinner.

523
00:45:17,511 --> 00:45:22,440
Bill, I'm really sorry.
I totally forgot about you not eating meat.

524
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,068
No sweat. It's terrific.

525
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:28,406
No, really. I get hungry enough,
I'll eat anything.

526
00:45:50,078 --> 00:45:51,974
Give me this book here.

527
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:56,941
I just thought maybe we'd...

528
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:00,231
Your timing is incredible.

529
00:46:02,276 --> 00:46:04,606
Sorry, honey. Those shots are...

530
00:46:10,177 --> 00:46:12,268
We're just out of sync, aren't we?

531
00:46:12,512 --> 00:46:15,239
We never want the same thing
at the same time.

532
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:22,535
Goodnight, Bill.

533
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:45,468
Turn around, Karen.

534
00:46:48,412 --> 00:46:50,376
What do you see?

535
00:46:51,444 --> 00:46:53,236
Can you see anything?

536
00:46:55,909 --> 00:46:57,376
Bill, it's...

537
00:47:01,712 --> 00:47:03,302
Screw you, then.

538
00:52:17,374 --> 00:52:18,533
Jesus.

539
00:53:41,543 --> 00:53:43,202
Over here, Terry.

540
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

541
00:55:45,778 --> 00:55:46,937
Hello?

542
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:51,272
Anybody here?

543
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

544
00:58:35,973 --> 00:58:37,199
Oh, God!

545
00:58:56,269 --> 00:58:57,499
Oh, God!

546
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:31,697
No!

547
01:00:46,472 --> 01:00:48,268
Come on, Christopher.

548
01:00:53,973 --> 01:00:56,960
Christopher, you're not
going to believe this.

549
01:01:05,342 --> 01:01:07,102
I'm in the bathroom.

550
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,936
I had that dream again.

551
01:01:12,438 --> 01:01:14,870
This time I think you were in it.

552
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:17,931
No wonder, honey.
You've been asleep all day.

553
01:01:18,006 --> 01:01:21,441
Jesus, where did you get
those scratches on your back?

554
01:01:23,406 --> 01:01:26,965
I guess they're from the other night,
when I got attacked.

555
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,660
They weren't there the other night.

556
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:33,465
Karen, you're really getting paranoid.

557
01:01:36,503 --> 01:01:40,496
- You've been with her, that Marsha girl?
- Don't lay your fantasies out on me.

558
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:44,063
- I'm not gonna take that...
- I know, it's all a big conspiracy...

559
01:01:44,141 --> 01:01:49,068
You don't have one inch of backbone!
She walks by you like a bitch in heat...

560
01:01:53,705 --> 01:01:55,262
Don't touch me.

561
01:02:05,538 --> 01:02:08,027
I'm going over to Doc's and call Chris.

562
01:02:08,105 --> 01:02:11,937
He'll come pick Terry and me up.
You can do whatever you want.

563
01:02:12,341 --> 01:02:15,794
- You don't know what it's like.
- I don't want to know.

564
01:02:22,703 --> 01:02:24,637
...and Eddie Quist, he lives...

565
01:02:24,706 --> 01:02:28,432
Calm down. You're not making any sense.
Eddie Quist is dead.

566
01:02:28,806 --> 01:02:31,736
I saw pictures just like we saw in his room.

567
01:02:32,138 --> 01:02:34,662
Christopher, the landscape...

568
01:02:35,773 --> 01:02:37,740
it's here at the Colony.

569
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:40,335
It's real.

570
01:02:41,372 --> 01:02:43,735
- Where are you, at Doc's?
- Yeah.

571
01:02:45,238 --> 01:02:47,831
Christopher, I'll tell you something.

572
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:51,367
I think he's got to be a part of this.

573
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,437
Is there some kind of file cabinet there?

574
01:02:57,741 --> 01:03:00,000
Are you sure you're all right?

575
01:03:00,338 --> 01:03:02,636
Yeah, I'm okay.

576
01:03:03,407 --> 01:03:05,895
It sure is good to hear your voice.

577
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,169
Look in the files under "Quist."

578
01:03:10,973 --> 01:03:12,871
You won't hang up, will you?

579
01:03:12,941 --> 01:03:17,165
I'll get the police there as soon as I can.
Just go look in the file.

580
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:20,833
Okay, hold on.
Never mind, you're coming with me.

581
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:35,130
"Quist, Marsha."

582
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:39,029
"Quist, T. C."

583
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's Eddie Quist.

584
01:04:14,571 --> 01:04:17,867
Operator, get me
the County Sheriff's Department, quick!

585
01:04:37,072 --> 01:04:38,732
No, don't bother.

586
01:04:39,173 --> 01:04:43,571
I'll get hold of the state boys
and we'll meet you over at the center.

587
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:46,933
I wouldn't worry, Mr. Halloran.
I'm sure she's safe.

588
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:45,203
Those are real silver. I got to check
with a jeweler to find out what to charge!

589
01:05:45,272 --> 01:05:46,499
Bill me.

590
01:05:47,473 --> 01:05:48,836
Crazy fuck.

591
01:06:01,671 --> 01:06:03,635
I got to use your phone.

592
01:06:05,903 --> 01:06:08,428
Jesus Christ, what happened in here?

593
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

594
01:07:14,404 --> 01:07:16,200
- Hello, Karen.
- Eddie.

595
01:07:18,272 --> 01:07:19,934
I'm glad you came.

596
01:07:20,574 --> 01:07:22,597
I wanted to see you again.

597
01:07:25,206 --> 01:07:26,692
I saw you die.

598
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:34,197
You said on the phone
that you wanted to get to know me.

599
01:07:34,774 --> 01:07:36,400
Here I am, Karen.

600
01:07:37,276 --> 01:07:38,637
Look at me.

601
01:07:42,174 --> 01:07:44,828
I want to give you a piece of my mind.

602
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:47,967
I trusted you, Karen.

603
01:11:12,605 --> 01:11:16,163
Take it easy, pal.
Not all of us got enough money for a Mazda.

604
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:18,399
Some of us have to work for a living.

605
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm in a hurry here. This is an emergency!

606
01:11:27,171 --> 01:11:30,866
Come on out of there now, miss.
We've been waiting for you.

607
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,401
Took some persuading, did she?

608
01:13:01,605 --> 01:13:03,071
Where's Bill?

609
01:13:03,773 --> 01:13:05,240
He's one of us now.

610
01:13:05,306 --> 01:13:08,736
In time, he would have brought you
over to us. Our secret will be safe.

611
01:13:08,804 --> 01:13:10,667
It's wonderful, Karen.

612
01:13:10,837 --> 01:13:13,428
When I was first bitten, I fought against it.

613
01:13:13,502 --> 01:13:16,561
So did Jerry. And then we found the doctor.

614
01:13:16,938 --> 01:13:19,700
He helped us. He helped us to adjust.

615
01:13:19,872 --> 01:13:23,068
You see, Karen,
he understands all about the gift.

616
01:13:24,074 --> 01:13:27,230
He knows how to use it, how to control it.

617
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:31,059
You'd have Bill back.
There's still time if you accept the gift.

618
01:13:31,138 --> 01:13:33,399
It was a mistake to bring her to the Colony.

619
01:13:33,472 --> 01:13:35,837
We should have stuck with the old ways.

620
01:13:35,906 --> 01:13:39,136
Raising cattle for our feed.
Where's the life in that?

621
01:13:39,209 --> 01:13:42,795
- Humans are our cattle.
- Humans are our prey.

622
01:13:43,202 --> 01:13:45,966
We should feed on them,
like we've always done.

623
01:13:46,038 --> 01:13:48,970
Screw all this "Channel your energies" crap.

624
01:13:49,239 --> 01:13:51,365
But the danger of exposure...

625
01:13:52,474 --> 01:13:56,600
We need this shelter to plan,
to catch up with society.

626
01:13:57,339 --> 01:14:01,063
Times have changed and we haven't.
Not enough.

627
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:02,602
Shut up, Doc!

628
01:14:06,572 --> 01:14:09,231
You wouldn't listen to me. None of you.

629
01:14:12,306 --> 01:14:14,330
"We can fit in," you said.

630
01:14:15,207 --> 01:14:17,106
"We can live with them."

631
01:14:17,938 --> 01:14:20,095
You make me sick.

632
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:22,499
You're through, Doc.

633
01:14:23,404 --> 01:14:24,926
She's ours now.

634
01:14:43,108 --> 01:14:46,936
See what your friend did to me that night?

635
01:14:47,506 --> 01:14:51,702
What's the matter with you all? Have you
forgotten everything you've learned?

636
01:14:51,773 --> 01:14:53,894
She can't disappear. She's well-known.

637
01:14:53,969 --> 01:14:56,630
Right, we've got to make this
look like an accident.

638
01:14:56,706 --> 01:14:58,502
I won't let you do this.

639
01:15:05,305 --> 01:15:09,364
You can't tame what's meant to be wild.
It ain't natural.

640
01:15:12,738 --> 01:15:16,965
Violence is part of the human condition,
as history shows us.

641
01:15:17,738 --> 01:15:21,604
Coping with that fact,
living with it, presents each of us...

642
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:28,199
Fortunately, most of us are able
to deal constructively with those choices.

643
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,730
But for others, the animal lure of mayhem...

644
01:15:32,205 --> 01:15:35,296
the physical sensation
of life-and-death struggle...

645
01:15:35,372 --> 01:15:37,272
produces gratification.

646
01:15:37,341 --> 01:15:40,501
According to the autopsy reports,
Eddie's victims were bitten...

647
01:15:40,572 --> 01:15:43,437
almost as if
they had been attacked by an animal.

648
01:15:43,506 --> 01:15:45,870
Doctor, what can you tell me
about lycanthropy?

649
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:48,164
Where did you learn that term?

650
01:15:48,236 --> 01:15:51,398
- On the Late Late Show.
- It's a mental disorder.

651
01:15:51,472 --> 01:15:55,664
There are dozens of cases.
People like to walk about on all fours...

652
01:15:55,738 --> 01:15:59,899
to make bestial groans and sighs.
They prefer to eat raw meat.

653
01:16:00,206 --> 01:16:02,934
That certainly seems like
an awfully big coincidence...

654
01:16:03,007 --> 01:16:06,732
Karen being attacked by someone
with this kind of delusion.

655
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You're not going to believe this.
I've been attacked...

656
01:16:28,172 --> 01:16:29,799
Hello, brave boy.

657
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,234
Eddie?

658
01:16:34,373 --> 01:16:37,464
You know me, and I don't know you.

659
01:16:37,975 --> 01:16:40,271
- Now why is that?
- Where is she?

660
01:16:40,941 --> 01:16:43,028
Why? Is she your girlfriend?

661
01:16:43,905 --> 01:16:45,428
Where's Terry?

662
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:49,227
Just down at the ritual center,
down the path.

663
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:52,594
That's where Waggner sends us to...

664
01:16:53,439 --> 01:16:55,507
unwind.

665
01:16:55,638 --> 01:16:58,833
- He's so repressed.
- What did you do to her?

666
01:17:00,637 --> 01:17:02,568
She's got a sexy voice.

667
01:17:03,435 --> 01:17:05,834
I like a woman with a sexy voice.

668
01:17:10,071 --> 01:17:12,062
Listen to this part here.

669
01:17:13,073 --> 01:17:14,595
You are crazy.

670
01:17:16,372 --> 01:17:18,927
I'm much more than that, bright boy.

671
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,658
I'm much more.

672
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:23,629
Here.

673
01:17:24,538 --> 01:17:25,767
Take it.

674
01:17:28,505 --> 01:17:30,029
Call it a gift.

675
01:17:33,573 --> 01:17:35,330
Come on, bright boy.

676
01:17:39,004 --> 01:17:40,970
Don't you know anything?

677
01:17:57,669 --> 01:17:59,568
Put her and her friend in the car...

678
01:17:59,636 --> 01:18:04,264
pour gasoline over them, set fire to them,
and push them off the Coast Road.

679
01:18:08,339 --> 01:18:10,529
Chris, run! They'll kill you!

680
01:18:10,836 --> 01:18:13,531
That gun won't do you any good, mister.

681
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:19,403
Don't come any closer.

682
01:18:59,206 --> 01:19:01,035
I have silver bullets in here.

683
01:19:01,106 --> 01:19:03,663
Silver bullets, my ass.

684
01:19:04,636 --> 01:19:06,000
Get up, T.C.

685
01:19:16,905 --> 01:19:18,371
They're real.

686
01:19:24,302 --> 01:19:27,134
Don't come any closer, Doc, please.

687
01:19:36,873 --> 01:19:38,203
Thank God!

688
01:19:52,672 --> 01:19:54,436
Karen, get the door!

689
01:19:57,272 --> 01:19:58,758
Take the rifle.

690
01:20:07,172 --> 01:20:08,400
Come on!

691
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:14,329
- Is that the only door in the barn?
- Yeah, I think so.

692
01:20:16,569 --> 01:20:19,059
- Where's Terry?
- They killed her.

693
01:20:19,369 --> 01:20:20,995
And I think Bill.

694
01:21:21,604 --> 01:21:22,936
Take this.

695
01:21:30,669 --> 01:21:32,192
Get it started!

696
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:54,806
- How'd you find out about them?
- Terry called, right after...

697
01:21:54,874 --> 01:21:56,702
Stop, it's Sam.

698
01:22:05,803 --> 01:22:06,894
Duck!

699
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:27,264
I smell gas. Come on.

700
01:22:36,108 --> 01:22:37,595
Give it to me.

701
01:22:41,037 --> 01:22:42,265
Come on!

702
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:53,529
Lock the door!

703
01:23:19,901 --> 01:23:20,926
Go!

704
01:23:50,801 --> 01:23:53,063
We have to warn people, Chris.

705
01:23:53,368 --> 01:23:55,563
We have to make them believe.

706
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:10,560
There! I'm an artist. You look terrific!

707
01:24:11,435 --> 01:24:13,197
I know you are. Thanks.

708
01:24:13,769 --> 01:24:16,259
If you're done, Fran, thanks a lot.

709
01:24:26,601 --> 01:24:29,694
- I'm not sure I can go through with this.
- You have to.

710
01:24:29,769 --> 01:24:31,826
Okay, stand by on the set.

711
01:24:32,003 --> 01:24:35,369
Five, four, three, two...

712
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:37,494
Good evening.

713
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:41,163
More word on that fire that's burning
out of control up the coast tonight.

714
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:45,224
Firefighters have discovered the blaze
seems to have started at the Colony...

715
01:24:45,302 --> 01:24:47,166
an experimental living community...

716
01:24:47,237 --> 01:24:50,431
founded by author and behavior expert,
Dr. George Waggner.

717
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:51,798
She's ready.

718
01:24:51,869 --> 01:24:54,462
How does she look?
Does she look all right to you?

719
01:24:54,536 --> 01:24:57,369
Reports so far indicate
that bodies have been discovered...

720
01:24:57,439 --> 01:24:59,869
both inside and outside
the Colony buildings...

721
01:24:59,937 --> 01:25:02,423
many of them burned beyond recognition...

722
01:25:02,502 --> 01:25:06,627
in what authorities on the scene are calling
a Guyana-like spectacle.

723
01:25:06,702 --> 01:25:10,795
Now for an exclusive eyewitness report
on the incident, we welcome back...

724
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:14,669
If she shows any sign of freezing,
like the last time, go right to commercial.

725
01:25:14,739 --> 01:25:15,998
Take one.

726
01:25:17,507 --> 01:25:18,970
Good evening.

727
01:25:21,469 --> 01:25:23,527
From the day we're born...

728
01:25:23,638 --> 01:25:25,434
there is a battle we must fight.

729
01:25:25,503 --> 01:25:29,336
A struggle between
what is kind and peaceful in our natures...

730
01:25:29,873 --> 01:25:31,997
and what is cruel and violent.

731
01:25:32,071 --> 01:25:33,970
What the hell is this, an editorial?

732
01:25:34,038 --> 01:25:36,402
That choice is our birthright
as human beings...

733
01:25:36,473 --> 01:25:40,128
and the real gift
that differentiates us from the animals.

734
01:25:41,068 --> 01:25:43,433
It is as natural to us as the air we breathe...

735
01:25:43,502 --> 01:25:46,626
Did you pass this material?
She's not reading from the prompter.

736
01:25:46,703 --> 01:25:48,636
We changed it a little bit.

737
01:25:48,768 --> 01:25:50,792
But now, for some of us...

738
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:53,635
that choice has been taken away.

739
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:56,494
A secret society exists...

740
01:25:57,304 --> 01:25:59,529
and is living among all of us.

741
01:26:01,636 --> 01:26:04,364
They are neither people nor animals...

742
01:26:04,438 --> 01:26:06,801
but something in between.

743
01:26:07,438 --> 01:26:10,338
Monstrous mutations,
whose violent natures...

744
01:26:10,406 --> 01:26:13,166
- Ready one, take one.
...must be satisfied.

745
01:26:13,803 --> 01:26:17,598
I know what you're thinking,
because I've been where you are...

746
01:26:17,669 --> 01:26:19,603
- That's enough.
- Leave it.

747
01:26:19,671 --> 01:26:21,500
- Leave it? Cut!
- Leave it!

748
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:23,265
But I have proof...

749
01:26:24,937 --> 01:26:27,768
and tonight I'm going to
show you something...

750
01:26:29,272 --> 01:26:31,035
to make you believe.

751
01:26:42,237 --> 01:26:44,102
Holy shit!

752
01:26:53,136 --> 01:26:54,602
What is this?

753
01:26:55,036 --> 01:26:59,230
- What are you kids watching?
- The news lady's turned into a werewolf.

754
01:27:00,071 --> 01:27:01,299
Oh, boy!

755
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:28,837
Switch, damn it!

756
01:27:31,836 --> 01:27:33,564
Doesn't that look good?

757
01:27:33,637 --> 01:27:37,502
Tender, meaty chunks
of tantalizing nutrition...

758
01:27:37,571 --> 01:27:40,231
Things they do with special effects
these days!

759
01:27:40,304 --> 01:27:42,771
Did you see the one
about the guy in the spaceship?

760
01:27:42,839 --> 01:27:44,132
It was real.

761
01:27:44,203 --> 01:27:47,190
She turned into a werewolf,
and they shot her.

762
01:27:48,571 --> 01:27:50,196
You're plastered!

763
01:27:50,937 --> 01:27:52,597
Doesn't mean it wasn't real.

764
01:27:52,671 --> 01:27:57,036
Ernie, put a pepper steak on for me,
and a hamburger for the lady.

765
01:27:57,106 --> 01:28:00,197
- How do you want that?
- How do you want it, honey?

766
01:28:03,804 --> 01:28:04,893
Rare.

767
01:30:30,871 --> 01:30:32,167
Go now...

768
01:30:32,938 --> 01:30:34,699
and heaven help you.
