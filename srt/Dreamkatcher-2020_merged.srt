00:05:22,497 --> 00:05:24,659
What are you doing here?

3
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:26,632
Dreaming.

4
00:08:31,252 --> 00:08:34,222
Well, welcome to paradise.

5
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:35,722
It's nice.

6
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,592
Paradise may be
inhabited by nesting animals

7
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:42,254
and two years of dust.

8
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,321
Well, I'm not afraid

9
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:45,558
of a little work.

10
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:47,101
It's why we're here, right?

11
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:48,636
Yeah.

12
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,795
It's nice.

13
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,737
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,914
Where's Josh?

15
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:09,486
<i>Josh...</i>

16
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,654
<i>Josh...</i>

17
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:23,804
Hey.
Are you coming in, bud?

18
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:29,833
I love how they look
right onto the forest.

19
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:34,380
Makes it easier to see the bears
before they attack you.

20
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:41,677
Hey, Josh, you're in charge
of smores tonight.

21
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,486
Maybe later we'll get
the fire pit going, okay?

22
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:49,888
You remember where your room is?

23
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

24
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:57,119
This is my mom.

25
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,534
Oh, um,
she's very pretty, Josh.

26
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:26,184
Come here.

27
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,728
No.

28
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:30,594
I don't play.
I can dance...

29
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:36,396
- Okay.
- Yeah.

30
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,632
Okay, so we're
going to take this hand.

31
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,470
- Mm-hm.
- And put it right here.

32
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,168
- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

33
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:46,645
Get ready, when I nod,
you press down, okay.

34
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,805
- Okay.
- So...

35
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,610
No, no.

36
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:51,173
That wasn't nodding.

37
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:53,583
- Okay.
- Okay, here we go.

38
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Hey, I just want to say,
I'm so happy that...

39
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:04,255
Go have your own kid!

40
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:07,301
I'm so sorry.

41
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:09,530
He's killing me,
I'm going to go talk to him.

42
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:23,742
Um, no.

43
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:25,013
This is not a toy.

44
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,486
This stays downstairs,
okay, buddy?

45
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:37,122
Josh... you know Gail isn't
trying to replace Mom, right?

46
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:48,198
Okay.
Are you okay, by yourself?

47
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,970
You want me
to leave the light on?

48
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:53,847
- Josh?
- I'm not a baby.

49
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:55,211
Okay.

50
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:04,248
Goodnight.

51
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,008
It's kinda quiet, huh?

52
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:30,346
Peaceful, huh?

53
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:34,354
Well, I was gonna
say terrifying but...

54
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:46,224
You know, I just wanted to say

55
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,736
I know a lot
of women wouldn't...

56
00:13:56,477 --> 00:14:00,539
Thank you, for letting me
into your family.

57
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:01,911
Mm-hm.

58
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:06,943
<i>Josh... Josh... Josh...</i>

59
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:17,797
<i>Josh... Josh...</i>

60
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,625
<i>Josh...</i>

61
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:36,707
<i>Joshy?</i>

62
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:52,158
Joshy?

63
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,837
Hey, kiddo. It's me.

64
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:02,932
Mom?

65
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,137
Mom?

66
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:17,155
He's never had nightmares
before, not like this.

67
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:21,285
Mm... there is a theory
that suggests that we are

68
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:24,024
all the characters
in our dreams, 30,

69
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,327
if Josh's mom is splitting,

70
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:31,303
then could be he's just leaving
behind past trauma, so...

71
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:33,306
Could be a really good thing.

72
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:38,272
If this is a good thing, I don't want
to know what a bad one is.

73
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,223
Hey!

74
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:03,496
Hey...

75
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,564
For some reason
this is the only place

76
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:09,233
you can get a single bar.

77
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,745
And... it's gone.

78
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,713
Well, no news
is good news, right?

79
00:16:21,155 --> 00:16:24,216
Well, he wants a new chorus

80
00:16:24,324 --> 00:16:26,019
and he wants me
to make it more clever.

81
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:29,552
Alright, well, how about,
go and write your own song.

82
00:16:29,663 --> 00:16:34,931
I'm staying here with my kid...
and my girlfriend. Hmm?

83
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,696
It's catchy but wordy.

84
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:42,265
Hey... we got you this.

85
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,208
It's just a present.

86
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:46,777
Josh helped me pick it out.

87
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,405
No, I didn't.

88
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:50,546
Thanks, Josh.

89
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:52,881
- I said, no, I didn't!
- Hey.

90
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:57,151
Look, I'm going to try
to make it back tonight.

91
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,919
But if I can't make it back,
are you two going to be okay?

92
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:02,985
We'll be fine... ish.

93
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:05,259
Ooh...

94
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:07,664
- See, now that's clever.
- Mm-hm.

95
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,094
We'll see you tonight.

96
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:42,228
It's okay, just forest sounds,
nothing to be afraid of.

97
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:44,066
How would you know?

98
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:46,334
Well, you're right actually.

99
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:49,803
Does Dad love you?

100
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:53,773
Well, I hope so.

101
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:55,781
It's not fair.

102
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:59,046
- What's not fair?
- She's dead and you're...

103
00:17:59,153 --> 00:18:00,985
Go on. Why don't we...

104
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:04,888
Hey. Josh! Josh!

105
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:07,893
Hey! Hey!

106
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:11,556
Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

107
00:18:11,665 --> 00:18:13,224
Why'd you have to pick
our family?

108
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,825
Okay, this is not funny.
I'm going to count to three.

109
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:17,962
- Go have your own kid!
- Josh!

110
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:19,836
Oh, my God!

111
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:22,870
Oopsie.

112
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:28,106
Okay. Okay, that's...
that's not funny, get out.

113
00:18:28,182 --> 00:18:30,173
Get up! Get up!

114
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:33,549
That is not funny!
Okay, do not do that again!

115
00:18:43,397 --> 00:18:50,133
Hey, you know, I'm sorry
if I scared you before.

116
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:53,697
Josh, it's just
you really frightened me.

117
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:57,867
You can't take a joke.

118
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:13,626
Wow, this is pretty
awesome, huh?

119
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:18,087
Did you see
what happened to the trail?

120
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:22,294
Hey, Josh, maybe don't
go in there.

121
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:23,961
What does that say?

122
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:30,401
I don't know,
it looks like Dreamcatchers.

123
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:36,844
What's this?

124
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:40,251
I don't know,
some kind of crafty nonsense.

125
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Well, we probably shouldn't be here,
this is somebodys place.
What do you think's in here?
- Tetanus?
- Nope.
There's no tetanus in here.

126
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:54,860
But lots of stuff for sale.

127
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:57,905
Some beautiful, some strange,

128
00:19:57,971 --> 00:20:01,407
some a little bit scary,
some yummy.

129
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:05,173
Ms. Ruth's wild berry jam.

130
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,249
We're just looking for
the trail, actually.

131
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:10,443
Like what scary stuff?

132
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:13,778
Do I know you?

133
00:20:16,189 --> 00:20:20,353
You got smart little jack rabbit eyes,
you a little jack rabbit?

134
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,327
My mom and dad used to
live around here.

135
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,091
My mom drowned in a pond.

136
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,398
We should probably go, Josh.

137
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:30,732
That was your mom?

138
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:37,438
Come on, we got spirit traps,
let me show ya.

139
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:40,947
Um, Josh, come on.

140
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:43,278
I'm not a baby.

141
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,977
No, you're not a baby.

142
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:47,349
And did you know
that the spirits

143
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,422
wander through these woods?

144
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:51,924
They like to linger
in old barns.

145
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,627
They visit you in your sleep.

146
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:57,761
In your dreams.

147
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,234
Do you have had dreams?

148
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:04,026
Cause a spirit trap
will catch 'em!

149
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,505
Listen, shh.

150
00:21:07,574 --> 00:21:10,236
Oh, my goodness!
They are in here right now!

151
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:11,834
They're trying
to tell you something.

152
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:14,847
Something very important.
They are saying,

153
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:19,910
"Buy Ms. Ruth's
Wild Berry Jam."

154
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:24,721
Ahh, come on.
I'm just playing with him.

155
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,589
Okay. Come on.

156
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:28,161
Trail picks up
right over there.

157
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:29,855
- Great, thank you.
- Yeah.

158
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,696
Hey, hey, hey!
Josh, is that your name?

159
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,359
See you around,
little jack rabbit.

160
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:54,246
Ms. Ruth was pretty cool.

161
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,380
Uh, well,
she's pretty something alright.

162
00:21:57,491 --> 00:22:00,893
You don't believe that stuff
about spirit traps, do you?

163
00:22:00,994 --> 00:22:02,621
You know that's nonsense.

164
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:06,723
She said they were real.
She said they catch your dreams.

165
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,632
You know how dreams work,
don't you?

166
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:10,203
Yeah, they scare
the shit out of you.

167
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,534
Hey, language.

168
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,137
Josh, dreams don't come
from out here, alright.

169
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:20,213
They come from in here.

170
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:23,606
It's just your mind's way
of figuring out stuff

171
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,151
that's going on in your life.

172
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:27,311
So if you're having
had dreams,

173
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:30,823
it means you're probably dealing
with some stuff that's difficult.

174
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:34,121
And you could talk about it.

175
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,924
You don't want to talk about it,
you could try drawing it up.

176
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,761
You know, if you can see it,
sometimes it makes it

177
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,095
a little less scary.

178
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,429
Helps you understand it,

179
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,065
and maybe you can figure it out
in your real life.

180
00:22:48,141 --> 00:22:50,610
- Does that make sense?
- I guess.

181
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:55,581
I want to tell you something,
this is a secret.

182
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:57,879
You're in control.

183
00:22:57,951 --> 00:23:00,113
Okay, so when
you're falling asleep,

184
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,245
just think good thoughts
about your mom,

185
00:23:02,322 --> 00:23:05,849
you know, think about some
of the good times that you guys had,

186
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:09,520
and I promise you,
it'll be better.

187
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:10,790
Okay?

188
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:15,465
- What did I say?
- I'm in control.

189
00:23:15,535 --> 00:23:16,696
That's right.

190
00:23:17,637 --> 00:23:18,934
Say it a little bit louder.

191
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:21,133
- I'm in control.
- Okay, scream it.

192
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:25,008
- I'm in control!
- Yes!

193
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,309
You are.
You're in control, Josh.

194
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:34,286
- Can I get a dreamcatcher?
- No way.

195
00:24:00,714 --> 00:24:03,342
<i>You're looking at a man
who's just written</i>

196
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,315
<i>16 versions of the same chorus.</i>

197
00:24:05,385 --> 00:24:08,377
Well, I'm not looking at him,
cause you're not here.

198
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,355
<i>Listen, I'm sorry. How's Josh?</i>

199
00:24:11,424 --> 00:24:14,257
He's good. He's been talking
about Becky, which is good.

200
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:16,830
He's been expressing
signs of anger,

201
00:24:16,897 --> 00:24:18,831
so at least we're talking.

202
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:21,266
It's raw, but I actually
think it's good.

203
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:26,338
Luke? Luke...

204
00:24:41,254 --> 00:24:42,915
<i>If you guys
want to come back to the city</i>

205
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,321
- <i>I can arrange for a car...</i>
- No, what I'm saying is

206
00:24:45,392 --> 00:24:47,053
I think it's good
if we stay here.

207
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,423
I think it's good for him.

208
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:58,200
Luke, can you tell me again,
how Becky drowned?

209
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:07,544
Joshy.

210
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:13,784
Hey, kiddo. I've come
to take you home with me.

211
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:18,256
<i>I told you, she was swimming
and her heart just stopped.</i>

212
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:20,487
- <i>Why does it matter?</i>
- Well, it's just something

213
00:25:20,594 --> 00:25:23,894
that your neighbor Ruth said,
or maybe it's the way she said it.

214
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:26,058
<i>Oh, fuck, not Ruth.</i>

215
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:28,123
<i>Just do me a favor,
stay away from her.</i>

216
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:29,463
Don't be afraid.

217
00:25:30,937 --> 00:25:32,462
I'm your mommy.

218
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:38,010
<i>Seriously, do not talk to...</i>

219
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:41,206
- <i>Gail... Gail...</i>
- Hello?

220
00:25:42,248 --> 00:25:43,238
Luke?

221
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,046
Hey. Hey, Josh.

222
00:26:14,147 --> 00:26:16,616
Hey, wake up.
Wake up, buddy.

223
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:20,551
Hey, hey. Hey.
It's okay.

224
00:26:21,688 --> 00:26:23,782
It's just a bad dream.

225
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:26,986
Just a dream.

226
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,528
You okay?

227
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,807
You know it's okay
to be scared, don't you?

228
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:46,940
Hm?

229
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:05,960
Josh?

230
00:27:09,703 --> 00:27:10,870
Josh?

231
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:45,564
Hey, what are you doing here,
little jack rabbit?

232
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:51,400
Just trying to find
some spirit traps.

233
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:54,772
Maybe you better go home.

234
00:27:56,249 --> 00:27:58,684
You come back
with the lady you were with.

235
00:27:58,752 --> 00:28:01,414
Tell her Ms. Ruth
accepts cash only.

236
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,288
Will you please help me?

237
00:28:07,093 --> 00:28:09,528
Are you okay?

238
00:28:09,596 --> 00:28:12,622
Do all these catch had dreams?

239
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:17,829
Uh, some do,
some catch evil spirits.

240
00:28:17,937 --> 00:28:20,929
Some catch bad energy.
Some catch dreams.

241
00:28:21,007 --> 00:28:23,738
Gail says we control
our own dreams.

242
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,745
She says all this stuff
is nonsense.

243
00:28:26,813 --> 00:28:28,747
She does, does she?

244
00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:32,308
She's a child psychologist.
She knows stuff like that.

245
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:34,284
- Yeah.
- Anyways, that's why

246
00:28:34,354 --> 00:28:36,015
she's trying to fix me.

247
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,522
- Are you broken?
- Sometimes.

248
00:28:43,463 --> 00:28:47,991
You know what,
sometimes we're all broken.

249
00:28:50,303 --> 00:28:52,567
Take off this pack.

250
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:54,403
Sit yourself down.

251
00:28:54,474 --> 00:28:56,101
Here, put these on.

252
00:28:56,176 --> 00:28:59,305
I'm going to show you
how to fix some stuff.

253
00:29:09,322 --> 00:29:12,314
So, we use this,
then I won't hurt my fingers,

254
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:14,689
and I probably won't need to
wear gloves when I do it.

255
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,525
Great job!
I betcha this one will sell.

256
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,223
What do you think?

257
00:29:19,332 --> 00:29:22,029
Why'd you scratch out
the dreamcatchers on your sign?

258
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,635
Well, I don't make
dreamcatchers anymore.

259
00:29:27,707 --> 00:29:29,471
Just spirit traps...

260
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:31,306
Hey, Josh,

261
00:29:31,377 --> 00:29:32,469
What are you doing here?

262
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:34,513
Can we please get one?

263
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:37,482
Okay, wait outside.

264
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:40,747
Go on.

265
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,982
Well, your little friend
sure wants something.

266
00:29:48,862 --> 00:29:52,821
You know,
some people might find

267
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:56,233
this kind of thing offensive.

268
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,134
Misappropriating
other people's cultures.

269
00:29:58,204 --> 00:30:01,230
Excuse me,
nobody's got the market cornered

270
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,036
on protecting themselves
from evil.

271
00:30:03,142 --> 00:30:06,669
You know, all cultures
have a way to trap bad things.

272
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:10,546
This is called a Ojos de Dios.

273
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,314
Here's one from Scotland.
It's called a Rowan cross.

274
00:30:14,387 --> 00:30:18,381
And I have a book to show you.
I know you like books.

275
00:30:19,592 --> 00:30:23,358
People always find a way
to ward off what scares them.

276
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:26,057
And don't touch anything,
please.

277
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:29,296
Yeah...

278
00:32:09,268 --> 00:32:13,262
You are nosy, aren't you?
Do you mind putting that back?

279
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,202
Is Noah your son?

280
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,112
Was my grandson.

281
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:26,880
He's dead, they're all dead!
Just like Josh's mother.

282
00:32:28,087 --> 00:32:30,715
Josh's dad told me
about the accident.

283
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,019
Oh, is that what he called it?

284
00:32:34,193 --> 00:32:35,558
Get out.

285
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,102
Never came back here again,
got it?

286
00:32:56,616 --> 00:32:58,084
Alright.

287
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,152
Are you okay with the light out?

288
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:04,684
Shut my door.

289
00:33:57,276 --> 00:34:02,976
Once upon a time, there was
a knight named Sir Josh,

290
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,413
and he had a sword.

291
00:34:04,484 --> 00:34:08,387
Shh... shh... it's okay honey.

292
00:34:08,454 --> 00:34:10,980
- It's okay now.
- No, no, no, no, no.

293
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,787
It always starts like this
and then it turns into a nightmare.

294
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:15,452
- No...
- And then you get all scary and...

295
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:19,794
No, I'm not a nightmare,
not anymore.

296
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:23,096
Shh. Now that you
have the dreamcatcher,

297
00:34:23,236 --> 00:34:24,635
I can come home.

298
00:34:24,737 --> 00:34:26,000
Are you really here?

299
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:30,768
Not yet.
I'm just up here.

300
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,345
I'm not strong enough yet.

301
00:34:34,981 --> 00:34:36,779
Are you hungry?
I'll go...

302
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,442
I'll just eat you.

303
00:35:00,206 --> 00:35:02,868
Dad promised he'd be home.

304
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,945
Well, I know
he'll be back as soon as he can.

305
00:35:09,182 --> 00:35:11,014
We could go hiking again.

306
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,613
Hiking's just walking.

307
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:20,381
How'd you sleep?

308
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:26,061
I saw my mom...
in my dream.

309
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:30,866
She read me a stow.

310
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:37,400
I'm hungry.

311
00:35:39,278 --> 00:35:41,940
Hey, I make a mean pancake.

312
00:35:44,217 --> 00:35:47,187
So when you dreamed
about your mom last night,

313
00:35:47,553 --> 00:35:49,112
how was she?

314
00:35:49,222 --> 00:35:50,690
She was normal.

315
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,014
She was pretty.

316
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,255
She was happy.

317
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:02,763
You know, I don't think
there's any pancake mix in here.

318
00:36:02,868 --> 00:36:04,768
I mean,
there's a little mouse poop.

319
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,771
Ow! Ow...

320
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,943
- Why did you do that?
- Do what?

321
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,672
- Leave this door open.
- I didn't do anything.

322
00:36:14,747 --> 00:36:17,375
- Josh.
- I said I didn't do anything!

323
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,714
Hey, hey, hey, come back.

324
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:23,346
Josh, come on, let's...
let's do something fun.

325
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,360
Well, this is fun.

326
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:07,899
Dad says not to talk
while fishing.

327
00:37:09,302 --> 00:37:11,293
My mom died here.

328
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:14,600
Who told you that?

329
00:37:14,674 --> 00:37:15,937
My mom.

330
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:17,942
What do you mean?

331
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,603
In my dream.

332
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,671
She said that she was sorry
that she had to leave.

333
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,648
But she said
when she comes back,

334
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,515
she'll never ever
leave me again.

335
00:37:31,157 --> 00:37:33,353
Do you want to talk about it?

336
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,258
It's like I know
she's always with me.

337
00:37:37,196 --> 00:37:39,790
But I just feel different.

338
00:37:39,865 --> 00:37:41,355
Is that normal?

339
00:37:44,737 --> 00:37:47,138
It's more than normal.

340
00:37:47,573 --> 00:37:51,009
It's very healthy
and grown up.

341
00:37:52,345 --> 00:37:54,712
You don't have to do that.

342
00:37:55,848 --> 00:37:57,247
Do what?

343
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:00,080
Act all cheerleadery.

344
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:03,747
Like you're my mom.
I don't need a mom.

345
00:38:03,856 --> 00:38:08,054
Like I said, she'll always
be in here with me.

346
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:11,462
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Ow! Ow!

347
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,055
I'm sorry!

348
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:16,533
Stop! Let's just pause
for a minute, okay.

349
00:38:16,635 --> 00:38:18,467
Ow...

350
00:38:18,537 --> 00:38:20,232
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

351
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,036
Alright...

352
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,903
Does it hurt?

353
00:38:30,649 --> 00:38:33,641
I'm sorry I hooked you.

354
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,017
That's okay, sweetie,
you didn't mean it.

355
00:38:37,823 --> 00:38:41,589
That's good.
Ooh, thank you.

356
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,338
Look, this is not a joke,
mis...

357
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:07,428
Okay, bed time.
Turn it off.

358
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,201
When's Dad coming?

359
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:13,337
Josh, it's been a long day,
please just turn it off.

360
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,481
Why would you do that
with the photos?

361
00:41:23,556 --> 00:41:25,991
- Do what?
- Don't lie to me, okay.

362
00:41:26,058 --> 00:41:27,651
I swear, I didn't do anything.

363
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:29,421
Come on,
I thought we were friends.

364
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,553
I didn't do anything!

365
00:41:35,334 --> 00:41:36,358
Door!

366
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:07,324
Josh, I said no iPad!

367
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,648
Josh... hey.

368
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,325
Dad said Gail loves me.

369
00:43:16,301 --> 00:43:18,998
<i>She wants to kill you.</i>

370
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:20,835
She does?

371
00:43:22,675 --> 00:43:25,042
<i>Honey, do you love me?</i>

372
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,942
Yes.

373
00:43:28,447 --> 00:43:30,506
<i>Don't you want to see me again?</i>

374
00:43:31,884 --> 00:43:33,215
Yes.

375
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:37,380
When are you coming back...
for good?

376
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,685
<i>I'm not strong enough yet.</i>

377
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:41,988
<i>So I need you to help me.</i>

378
00:43:44,697 --> 00:43:47,291
<i>You need to stop her.</i>

379
00:43:47,366 --> 00:43:50,165
But she's nice,
she took me fishing.

380
00:43:50,235 --> 00:43:53,261
<i>You can only love one of us.</i>

381
00:43:53,372 --> 00:43:55,338
<i>Those are
just the rules, Joshy.</i>

382
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:08,913
<i>Gail, I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.</i>

383
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,682
<i>They're making me
stay another night.</i>

384
00:44:10,756 --> 00:44:12,952
I'm telling you I'm just going
to walk right out of here.

385
00:44:13,058 --> 00:44:14,856
Fuck.

386
00:44:25,904 --> 00:44:27,269
How are you feeling?

387
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:30,570
Hmm?

388
00:44:30,676 --> 00:44:34,169
I think it's going to rain later,
so it's probably an inside day.

389
00:44:36,749 --> 00:44:38,046
You alright?

390
00:44:38,117 --> 00:44:39,346
It's okay, don't move,

391
00:44:39,418 --> 00:44:40,943
I'll... I'll clean it up.

392
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,748
Don't walk on this.

393
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,730
Sorry, I just...
I'm so tired.

394
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:57,799
Whatcha been doing
this morning?

395
00:44:59,304 --> 00:45:02,797
Just doing the pictures
like you told me.

396
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,307
Oh...

397
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:08,444
So, tell me, what's this?

398
00:45:08,514 --> 00:45:10,915
That's Daddy, that's Mommy,
and that's me.

399
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:13,452
Oh, what's this one?

400
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:15,681
- This one?
- Yeah.

401
00:45:15,788 --> 00:45:18,985
- That's you.
- Who's this?

402
00:45:20,459 --> 00:45:21,927
That's your dead baby.

403
00:45:25,964 --> 00:45:28,331
Just my mind
working through things.

404
00:45:30,068 --> 00:45:35,234
Um... I'm just going to go
get your sneakers, okay,

405
00:45:35,307 --> 00:45:37,002
so don't move.

406
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:50,479
Mm, just can't find that extra
pink piece for this.

407
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:52,751
Does this one go there?

408
00:45:53,692 --> 00:45:57,219
Mm... no.

409
00:45:59,398 --> 00:46:01,127
You okay?

410
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,464
Just a little bit tired.

411
00:46:04,703 --> 00:46:09,163
Me too.

412
00:46:23,355 --> 00:46:25,551
Me and my mom used to do this.

413
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,479
You alright?

414
00:46:49,748 --> 00:46:52,911
Yeah. I think I need to go
upstairs to bed.

415
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,163
Okay, Mommy.

416
00:48:53,105 --> 00:48:54,539
Josh!

417
00:49:00,012 --> 00:49:01,173
Josh!

418
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,713
Josh! Hey, Josh!

419
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:09,916
Josh!

420
00:49:11,723 --> 00:49:13,851
Sweetie?
Hey, hey, hey...

421
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:15,984
I saw my mommy!
She was killed!

422
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:18,223
Hey, Josh.

423
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,389
Sweetie. Josh!

424
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:24,868
Josh. Hey, hey, Josh! Josh.

425
00:49:24,936 --> 00:49:27,997
Hey, you're dreaming.

426
00:49:28,073 --> 00:49:31,509
It's okay.
It's okay, I'm right here.

427
00:49:31,576 --> 00:49:35,308
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

428
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,714
It's okay. It's okay.

429
00:50:43,782 --> 00:50:46,251
Oh, my God!

430
00:50:51,223 --> 00:50:54,989
Hey, how you doing?

431
00:50:55,794 --> 00:50:57,284
I'm in control.

432
00:50:57,963 --> 00:50:59,624
Yeah, you are.

433
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,659
There's honey in here.

434
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,094
Ruth?

435
00:51:07,172 --> 00:51:08,640
Where is it?

436
00:51:08,707 --> 00:51:09,936
- No, don't go!
- Hey! What?

437
00:51:10,008 --> 00:51:11,271
- No, don't go!
- Hey, hey, hey,

438
00:51:11,343 --> 00:51:12,811
you can't just come
running in here.

439
00:51:12,878 --> 00:51:14,505
No, he broke into my barn
and he took something!

440
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,944
- Josh?
- Josh!

441
00:51:22,487 --> 00:51:24,148
Don't go away again, Mommy!

442
00:51:26,024 --> 00:51:29,221
Okay, Josh, did you take
something from Ms. Ruth's barn?

443
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,157
Okay, you need to give it back.

444
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,720
No, no!
I don't want it back.

445
00:51:33,832 --> 00:51:35,527
But you need to listen.

446
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,830
It was safe where it was,
but not anymore.

447
00:51:37,903 --> 00:51:39,928
You let it out,
and now you're both in danger.

448
00:51:40,005 --> 00:51:42,030
You need to destroy it now!

449
00:51:46,444 --> 00:51:48,310
I don't need it anymore.

450
00:51:49,714 --> 00:51:51,978
You, stay here.

451
00:51:56,555 --> 00:51:58,455
Just tell me,
what happened to your family?

452
00:51:58,523 --> 00:52:01,049
What happened to Becky,
what happened to Noah?

453
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,321
- Just tell me.
- You're not hearing me, just...

454
00:52:03,395 --> 00:52:05,864
just throw it into the fire.
Burn it!

455
00:52:05,964 --> 00:52:08,490
Okay, fine!
I'll throw it in the fire.

456
00:52:17,576 --> 00:52:18,941
Little Noah...

457
00:52:21,746 --> 00:52:24,772
He was just
a regular little guy.

458
00:52:24,883 --> 00:52:28,183
He was smart, funny.

459
00:52:28,253 --> 00:52:32,121
Was a little bit quirky,
he liked odd things.

460
00:52:32,224 --> 00:52:35,922
He had a collection that
he called his "special stuff"

461
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:39,395
that had dead animal fur,

462
00:52:39,464 --> 00:52:43,264
bones, dead bugs.

463
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:47,032
His father would say,
"Get rid of that junk!

464
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:52,601
Normal boys play sports
and they have friends."

465
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,708
I was his friend.

466
00:53:02,287 --> 00:53:07,123
<i>It was Christmas, and I wanted
to find the perfect present,</i>

467
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:10,456
<i>and there was a yard sale
down the street,</i>

468
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,054
<i>and I found that thing.</i>

469
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:19,503
<i>This crazy woman said to me,
"Whoever hangs it in their room</i>

470
00:53:19,604 --> 00:53:23,404
<i>will be protected
from evil forever."</i>

471
00:53:23,475 --> 00:53:27,343
<i>I thought, the perfect present.</i>

472
00:53:28,847 --> 00:53:30,838
Boy, was I wrong.

473
00:53:32,951 --> 00:53:34,919
Protect him from evil?

474
00:53:37,355 --> 00:53:39,449
It was pure evil.

475
00:53:40,325 --> 00:53:42,521
It devoured him,

476
00:53:42,627 --> 00:53:48,066
and then one day he followed
his parents into the woods,

477
00:53:48,133 --> 00:53:53,731
and this little boy
hacked them to death.

478
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,402
<i>Came upon them
all hacked to pieces.</i>

479
00:53:59,344 --> 00:54:01,745
<i>Except for Noah.</i>

480
00:54:01,813 --> 00:54:04,305
<i>Suddenly, he... he just
leapt at me like a wild animal,</i>

481
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:07,784
<i>and he was waving this axe,
screaming at the top of his lungs.</i>

482
00:54:07,852 --> 00:54:10,617
<i>Make it get out!
Make it get out!</i>

483
00:54:14,492 --> 00:54:17,154
And then he killed Josh's mom.

484
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:42,816
Once upon a time,
there was a boy named Josh,

485
00:54:42,887 --> 00:54:45,481
and he had a hatchet.

486
00:54:45,557 --> 00:54:47,787
As a psychotherapist,
I can tell you

487
00:54:47,859 --> 00:54:51,853
that kids have issues, alright.

488
00:54:51,963 --> 00:54:54,227
And using science,

489
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:59,168
we just need to treat them
with therapy or with medicine,

490
00:54:59,237 --> 00:55:02,730
and this voodoo bullshit
it doesn't help.

491
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,240
It doesn't help anyone.

492
00:55:06,244 --> 00:55:09,009
And I'm just suggesting
that you just drop it.

493
00:55:13,718 --> 00:55:15,413
Gail, help, I can't move!

494
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,046
Shh!

495
00:56:06,604 --> 00:56:08,698
Sorry.
Hey.

496
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:15,375
How could you just
leave us here?

497
00:56:15,447 --> 00:56:17,939
I had to go to the city.

498
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:24,147
Why didn't you tell me
Becky was killed?

499
00:56:25,356 --> 00:56:26,346
What are you talking about?

500
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:28,324
I read an article, okay.

501
00:56:31,463 --> 00:56:33,830
I don't... I don't like
thinking about that.

502
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,263
Okay, well that's something

503
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:36,926
that you might
want to mention, alright.

504
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:40,164
Yeah, I... I know.
I'm sorry, I should have told you.

505
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:43,468
Hey, hey, buddy!
I missed you.

506
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:48,644
Uh, listen, Gail and I,
we have to talk for a minute,

507
00:56:48,713 --> 00:56:51,512
so, can you go in the kitchen
and fix me something to eat?

508
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,344
I'm so hungry.

509
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,781
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

510
00:56:58,523 --> 00:57:01,288
How was it, how's he been?

511
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,521
Uh, not good.

512
00:57:04,028 --> 00:57:05,427
He's been sleepwalking.

513
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:10,428
Do you guys want some pie?!

514
00:57:10,502 --> 00:57:12,470
Uh, yeah, buddy.

515
00:57:12,537 --> 00:57:15,302
- Sleepwalk?
- Yeah, that's the least of his problems.

516
00:57:15,373 --> 00:57:17,307
He left the cupboard door
open on purpose

517
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:19,867
so he could hit me
on the back of the head.

518
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,811
He hooked me
with a fishing hook.

519
00:57:22,881 --> 00:57:25,407
Well, I'm... I'm sorry
you had a couple of accidents.

520
00:57:25,517 --> 00:57:28,418
It's not accidents.
I mean, I'm napping, I wake up,

521
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,319
and I am covered
in a sea of Becky photos.

522
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:34,256
- I don't understand.
- He slashes the scarf that you gave me.

523
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:37,260
He breaks into Ruth's barn.
She comes here...

524
00:57:37,362 --> 00:57:39,421
I... I told you
to stay away from her.

525
00:57:39,531 --> 00:57:42,228
And... and kids
pull pranks all the time.

526
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,597
When I was a kid,
I... I pulled pranks,

527
00:57:44,702 --> 00:57:46,500
I shoplifted once on a dare.

528
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:49,165
- This is not a prank.
- And I've slept walked before.

529
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,833
Here, actually.

530
00:57:50,909 --> 00:57:52,843
I woke up in the...
in the fucking woods.

531
00:57:52,911 --> 00:57:54,811
Do you want me
to show you the scarf?

532
00:57:54,879 --> 00:57:56,677
I don't need to see the scarf!

533
00:57:56,748 --> 00:57:59,376
I just want to have a weekend,
with my son

534
00:57:59,484 --> 00:58:02,476
with some quality time,
that's nice, where I can relax!

535
00:58:02,554 --> 00:58:04,386
I understand.
What about me?

536
00:58:11,663 --> 00:58:13,324
Oh, thanks, buddy.

537
00:58:14,065 --> 00:58:15,533
Thank you, Josh.

538
00:58:17,735 --> 00:58:19,601
Can we go fishing tomorrow?

539
00:58:20,338 --> 00:58:21,863
Yeah, we'll see.

540
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:29,211
Mmm, this is
pretty good pie, Joshy.

541
00:58:31,783 --> 00:58:36,050
Well, I'm glad you like it, 'cause
it's pretty much all we have left.

542
00:58:38,623 --> 00:58:40,648
I'm sorry. It's just...

543
00:58:40,758 --> 00:58:43,159
It's just we've had a few
misadventures, haven't we, Josh?

544
00:58:45,263 --> 00:58:46,458
Haven't we?

545
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:53,893
Are you okay?

546
00:58:53,972 --> 00:58:55,201
Jesus Christ!

547
00:58:56,474 --> 00:58:58,238
- Did you do this!
- I didn't.

548
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:00,243
- Gail, come on.
- Answer me!

549
00:59:00,311 --> 00:59:02,575
- I didn't.
- You tell me the truth.

550
00:59:02,647 --> 00:59:03,978
Gail, for God's sake!

551
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,244
I said I didn't!
She hates me!

552
00:59:06,317 --> 00:59:08,979
Okay, we're so out of here.
Tonight!

553
00:59:23,501 --> 00:59:28,769
Josh... did Gail tell you
about the pond?

554
00:59:29,641 --> 00:59:30,870
About mom?

555
00:59:30,975 --> 00:59:32,101
No.

556
00:59:32,844 --> 00:59:33,970
Josh?

557
00:59:35,847 --> 00:59:37,781
I don't want to
get her in trouble.

558
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:40,341
Goddamnit.

559
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:43,512
Dad, I didn't do the thing
with the broken glass.

560
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:46,147
I... I know you didn't, Joshy.

561
00:59:46,224 --> 00:59:47,714
Gail, she's just, uh...

562
00:59:49,394 --> 00:59:52,227
She's just confused
about a lot of things.

563
00:59:53,331 --> 00:59:55,732
She told me
not to dream about mom.

564
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:56,959
What?

565
00:59:58,169 --> 01:00:00,194
Said it was unhealthy.

566
01:00:00,304 --> 01:00:02,432
And it showed
a sign of weakness.

567
01:00:06,444 --> 01:00:08,139
You just get some sleep, pal.

568
01:00:20,692 --> 01:00:25,061
Josh needs help, Luke.
More than I can give him.

569
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,632
Wait, do you...
you really think

570
01:00:27,699 --> 01:00:29,394
that he did this
to you on purpose?

571
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,161
He broke a glass the other day,

572
01:00:31,235 --> 01:00:33,897
he probably took the glass
out of the trash.

573
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,531
Yeah, what's... what's this?
Huh?

574
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:41,741
And you told him
not to dream about Becky?

575
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,871
No, I didn't tell him that.

576
01:00:43,948 --> 01:00:45,609
Joshy said that you did.

577
01:00:45,717 --> 01:00:47,378
Joshy says that I did.
You're going to take

578
01:00:47,452 --> 01:00:50,217
a child's word over mine?
'Cause I am telling you,

579
01:00:50,288 --> 01:00:52,723
I'm telling you, professionally,
he needs help.

580
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:54,884
Kids have had dreams.

581
01:00:54,959 --> 01:00:58,361
Maybe he needs to spend
more quality time with me.

582
01:00:58,429 --> 01:01:00,022
This is based on
your years of experience

583
01:01:00,164 --> 01:01:01,495
working with troubled children?

584
01:01:01,566 --> 01:01:03,557
Based on the fact
that he's my own goddamn son.

585
01:01:03,668 --> 01:01:05,898
I'm telling you,
he's traumatized!

586
01:01:06,003 --> 01:01:09,029
He's experiencing
latent violent tendencies,

587
01:01:09,107 --> 01:01:11,769
and you've got us
stuck here in this house

588
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:14,573
Where his mother was killed!
Are you fucking nuts?!

589
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:16,238
No, he's not troubled!

590
01:01:16,347 --> 01:01:19,214
He's confused,
he's six years old.

591
01:01:19,283 --> 01:01:21,274
Oh, Jesus Christ,
he's not six.

592
01:01:21,385 --> 01:01:24,047
- Yeah.
- No, he's not.

593
01:01:24,122 --> 01:01:26,523
No, I mean, I know...
I know he's not six.

594
01:01:26,591 --> 01:01:28,218
Because you would
like him to be six.

595
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:29,691
No, no, no, no.
No, don't do this.

596
01:01:29,761 --> 01:01:31,126
Yeah. You would
like him to be six...

597
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:32,788
Don't do this psychoanalytical
bullshit on me.

598
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:33,921
...because then he could
still be your little Joshy,

599
01:01:33,998 --> 01:01:35,227
and Becky would still be alive.

600
01:01:35,299 --> 01:01:36,892
I get it. I get it.

601
01:01:36,968 --> 01:01:38,936
And we need to get
the fuck out of here.

602
01:01:39,003 --> 01:01:40,334
I'm not kidding!

603
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,131
Honey...

604
01:02:11,669 --> 01:02:12,795
It's time.

605
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:16,801
She's ready.

606
01:02:45,169 --> 01:02:46,568
Go on.

607
01:02:46,671 --> 01:02:49,368
- I don't want to.
- She took my place.

608
01:02:49,473 --> 01:02:52,408
- Hey, you said you hated her.
- I don't, not really.

609
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,740
It's easy. Watch.

610
01:03:05,289 --> 01:03:06,984
Why'd you do that?!

611
01:03:09,527 --> 01:03:12,792
I didn't. You did.

612
01:03:12,864 --> 01:03:14,127
No!

613
01:03:21,138 --> 01:03:22,469
Hi, Gail.

614
01:03:37,889 --> 01:03:39,288
Luke?

615
01:03:40,558 --> 01:03:41,957
Luke?

616
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:00,901
Hey, Luke.

617
01:04:00,978 --> 01:04:02,707
What's going on?

618
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:05,647
What is this?

619
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,275
I was letting you sleep in.

620
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:09,376
Because we're getting
on the road, right?

621
01:04:09,453 --> 01:04:11,421
Babe, he's fine.
You're fine, right?

622
01:04:11,522 --> 01:04:13,923
Dad's going to teach me
how to chop some wood.

623
01:04:14,025 --> 01:04:15,857
We'll be careful,
we've got snacks.

624
01:04:15,927 --> 01:04:17,395
Listen, I want to
get out of here.

625
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:19,452
As soon as we get reception,
I'm calling Dr. Fisher.

626
01:04:19,563 --> 01:04:23,193
I am going to spend
some time with my son.

627
01:04:25,136 --> 01:04:28,936
Twenty minutes,
and then we're out of here.

628
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,804
Are we going to chop
some wood now?

629
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:33,878
Yeah, Josh, we're going to chop
the hell out of some wood now.

630
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,992
- My turn.
- No, hey... Slow down.

631
01:05:32,103 --> 01:05:34,629
Safety first. Come here.

632
01:05:34,705 --> 01:05:36,867
Put both hands on it.

633
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:40,410
Okay.
Just little swings.

634
01:05:40,511 --> 01:05:44,470
Nice and easy.
There you go. Okay?

635
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,148
There you go.

636
01:05:48,219 --> 01:05:50,881
Nice and easy.
Good.

637
01:06:02,867 --> 01:06:05,859
Now, Josh,
I said to use both hands, son.

638
01:06:10,941 --> 01:06:14,172
Hey, Josh, I said...
I said use both hands.

639
01:06:14,245 --> 01:06:16,543
Why didn't you tell me
how Mom died?

640
01:06:17,915 --> 01:06:19,679
- Okay...
- A little boy killed her.

641
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,377
Hand that over.

642
01:06:21,485 --> 01:06:24,079
Okay, Josh, that's enough.

643
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:25,519
You give me that.

644
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,820
Damn it!
Put that down, now!

645
01:06:28,893 --> 01:06:31,590
He threw her body into a pond.

646
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:35,757
Just a boy.
A boy like me.

647
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:37,595
Once upon a time,

648
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:40,030
there was a boy named Josh,

649
01:06:40,104 --> 01:06:42,072
and he had a hatchet.

650
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:14,369
Where's your Dad?

651
01:07:27,618 --> 01:07:28,983
What's this?

652
01:07:47,004 --> 01:07:48,267
Josh...

653
01:07:49,773 --> 01:07:51,366
Josh!

654
01:07:51,475 --> 01:07:53,170
Put that down!

655
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,836
Josh!

656
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,679
Josh!

657
01:08:00,651 --> 01:08:02,813
Okay...

658
01:08:02,887 --> 01:08:05,618
Remember... Can you remember
what we talked about?

659
01:08:05,689 --> 01:08:07,521
Okay, losing control?

660
01:08:12,496 --> 01:08:13,520
Josh?

661
01:08:28,212 --> 01:08:30,306
No!

662
01:08:32,683 --> 01:08:35,846
No!

663
01:08:40,391 --> 01:08:44,123
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

664
01:08:44,195 --> 01:08:46,687
What the fuck?!
What the fuck?!

665
01:09:35,946 --> 01:09:37,436
What are you doing?

666
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:40,017
Don't interrupt me.
It's for our own good.

667
01:09:43,687 --> 01:09:45,519
- Josh.
- Josh is dead.

668
01:09:45,589 --> 01:09:48,854
Josh, wake up.
Wake up, buddy.

669
01:09:51,762 --> 01:09:55,596
Josh! Your dad's coming back
and we're going to get out of here.

670
01:09:55,666 --> 01:09:57,100
I don't think Daddy's coming.

671
01:09:57,167 --> 01:09:59,158
What are you talking about?

672
01:10:00,137 --> 01:10:02,606
<i>Daddy wasn't safe
with the hatchet.</i>

673
01:10:04,842 --> 01:10:06,401
It's not Josh.

674
01:10:08,345 --> 01:10:10,313
It's this!

675
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:13,748
It can't be destroyed,
there's something that is living in there.

676
01:10:13,817 --> 01:10:15,683
It is indestructible.

677
01:10:16,353 --> 01:10:18,082
Josh. Josh!

678
01:10:23,494 --> 01:10:25,622
I saw it.

679
01:10:25,729 --> 01:10:27,720
I saw it last night
in my sleep.

680
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,667
And it was a woman.

681
01:10:32,469 --> 01:10:34,233
A miserable hag.

682
01:10:34,305 --> 01:10:37,331
Okay. Okay, Ruth.

683
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:39,466
Now you can't possibly
believe this.

684
01:10:39,576 --> 01:10:41,635
She has Noah's soul
for eternity,

685
01:10:41,745 --> 01:10:43,235
but now she has Josh.

686
01:10:44,748 --> 01:10:46,614
We have to kill him, Gail.

687
01:10:47,951 --> 01:10:49,510
You have to kill him.

688
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:51,853
Or he's going to kill you.

689
01:10:51,955 --> 01:10:53,184
He's going to kill me.

690
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:55,156
He's going to kill
everybody around us,

691
01:10:55,225 --> 01:10:57,159
and the evil is just
going to keep coming

692
01:10:57,227 --> 01:10:58,353
and coming and coming!

693
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:02,126
I understand. I understand.

694
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm going to help you, alright.
But I can't help you,
unless you untie me.

695
01:11:09,573 --> 01:11:10,665
What's happening?

696
01:11:12,376 --> 01:11:14,208
Get away, I'm not going back in!

697
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:15,244
Hey, hey, hey, stop!

698
01:11:15,346 --> 01:11:17,678
Where is he?!
Where is he?

699
01:11:17,748 --> 01:11:19,512
Is he in there?
You know where he is.

700
01:11:19,583 --> 01:11:21,415
Is my Noah in there?
Is he in pain?

701
01:11:21,518 --> 01:11:24,146
Of course, he's in pain,
can't you see he's sick?!

702
01:11:24,221 --> 01:11:25,279
He needs a doctor!

703
01:11:25,356 --> 01:11:27,450
You think I'm trapped in that?

704
01:11:27,524 --> 01:11:29,618
That's my home,
we all live in there.

705
01:11:29,693 --> 01:11:31,991
- Waiting...
- Waiting for what?

706
01:11:32,062 --> 01:11:33,689
For a place to play.

707
01:11:33,864 --> 01:11:35,457
But we got Noah.

708
01:11:35,532 --> 01:11:38,160
What fun we had with him.

709
01:11:38,235 --> 01:11:41,205
You let him go!
Don't you hurt him anymore!

710
01:11:41,305 --> 01:11:42,568
Fight it!

711
01:11:44,141 --> 01:11:47,202
Gail. Gail, what's happening?

712
01:11:49,046 --> 01:11:51,811
I don't know.
I don't know, Joshy.

713
01:11:51,882 --> 01:11:55,785
But I'm here.
I'm right here with you, okay.

714
01:11:55,886 --> 01:11:59,288
- Josh, is Noah in there?
- Just stop it!

715
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:03,088
For God's sake!
What do you want?!

716
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:05,787
It's not what I want, it's...
it's what that wants.

717
01:12:05,896 --> 01:12:07,386
Little boys just don't
become monsters.

718
01:12:07,464 --> 01:12:10,365
Oh, but they do...
they do, Ruth.

719
01:12:10,434 --> 01:12:13,131
And I'm sorry, I don't know
what happened to Noah.

720
01:12:13,237 --> 01:12:14,898
She knows what happened.

721
01:12:21,645 --> 01:12:23,204
Noah?

722
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,580
At first it kinda tickles
when they're inside you.

723
01:12:27,751 --> 01:12:29,583
But then they start eating you.

724
01:12:30,788 --> 01:12:32,586
It hurts so much.

725
01:12:32,689 --> 01:12:36,557
But when you let them play,
they don't feed on you.

726
01:12:37,528 --> 01:12:39,121
It's why they need us.

727
01:12:41,265 --> 01:12:42,960
You figured that much out.

728
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,034
I did. I did.

729
01:12:54,445 --> 01:12:59,144
<i>Just when I thought that
my life was over he stopped.</i>

730
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:01,946
<i>I thought he was
going to hug me.</i>

731
01:13:02,019 --> 01:13:06,456
<i>But instead, he grabbed my wrist
and put the axe in my hand,</i>

732
01:13:06,523 --> 01:13:10,482
<i>drew it across his own throat.</i>

733
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:12,494
<i>I watched him die, Gail.</i>

734
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:14,792
I killed my own grandson.

735
01:13:18,836 --> 01:13:20,861
I miss your hugs.

736
01:13:20,971 --> 01:13:22,666
Do you mean it, sweetheart?

737
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,707
God, I've missed you so much.

738
01:13:30,981 --> 01:13:33,848
Josh! Sweetie, wake up!

739
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,975
Oh...

740
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:43,620
Holy fuck.

741
01:13:44,361 --> 01:13:46,125
Josh. Josh.

742
01:13:46,196 --> 01:13:47,686
You're in control, Josh!

743
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:50,290
Stop! Please!

744
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:53,702
Josh, no!

745
01:14:01,211 --> 01:14:03,236
Josh, stop.

746
01:14:03,347 --> 01:14:05,076
Josh is dead!

747
01:14:08,185 --> 01:14:11,211
Sweetie... you're in control.

748
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:14,481
Say it. Say it!

749
01:14:14,558 --> 01:14:16,549
I'm in control.

750
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:21,063
No, no... No, Joshy, there's
someone else inside of you.

751
01:14:21,164 --> 01:14:23,360
There's someone very sweet.

752
01:14:23,433 --> 01:14:25,697
Somebody who your Daddy loves.

753
01:14:25,769 --> 01:14:27,601
Remember?
Remember how much

754
01:14:27,704 --> 01:14:30,298
you love your daddy
and your mommy?

755
01:14:30,374 --> 01:14:32,172
Sweetheart, they love you.

756
01:14:32,242 --> 01:14:35,212
They love you so much.
I love you.

757
01:14:35,312 --> 01:14:37,076
I love you! I love you!

758
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,239
I just wanted to be your mommy!

759
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:41,885
Mommy?

760
01:14:41,985 --> 01:14:43,714
Mommy?

761
01:16:36,867 --> 01:16:38,028
Hey, kid.

762
01:16:39,703 --> 01:16:41,102
You alright?

763
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:49,044
Yeah, just a little tired.

764
01:19:40,204 --> 01:19:45,204
