1
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:42,520
Let's get outta here!

2
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,397
Get out! Get out! Go!

3
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:46,566
Just leave the damn thing!
Come on!

4
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:47,817
Freeze!

5
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:53,573
Come on!
Just leave it!

6
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,035
Go, go, go, go!

7
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,372
Stay back! Stay down!

8
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,554
Let's go!
Come on. Let's go!

9
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:21,976
Now! Move it!
Go! Go!

10
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,117
Stop! Right there!

11
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,502
Morgana!

12
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:53,341
Oh, God. Are you okay?

13
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,802
- Yeah, I think so.
- Easy, easy, easy.

14
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:57,345
- Oh, God!
- What?

15
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:01,849
This stopped the bullet.

16
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:03,810
Oh, my God.

17
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,604
- Where'd you get that?
- It was inside the statue.

18
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,940
What happened?

19
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,733
It burned me!

20
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:12,735
Drop it!

21
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:14,654
- No!
- Watch out!

22
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:15,488
No!

23
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:29,168
Don't die. Don't die.
You're scaring me.

24
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:30,670
Get out of here.

25
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,051
- No.
- I love you, Morgana.

26
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:49,522
Go!

27
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,402
Get outta here.

28
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,087
Jesus.

29
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:56,964
Eric.

30
00:04:57,757 --> 00:05:00,301
I can help you.

31
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,261
Fuck off.

32
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:34,085
I can give you life everlastingly,
if you wish it.

33
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:42,176
I can end your pain

34
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,136
if you wish that.

35
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:48,224
I wished I'd never been born.

36
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,354
As you wish.

37
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:31,434
Done.

38
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,484
- Cover the back.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:41,485
Let's go.

40
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,555
Freeze!

41
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:56,018
Did I hear you say "freeze"?

42
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:01,148
Yeah. Yeah, you're goddamn right.
I said, "freeze!"

43
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:07,530
Done.

44
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,923
The time is come.

45
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,680
Fulfill the prophecy.

46
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:04,712
Hold it right there.

47
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:07,214
Now, put your hands up.

48
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:13,012
Now slowly turn around.

49
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,898
Open up your hands.
Slowly.

50
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,572
You wanna explain this to me?

51
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:34,658
He needed to chill out.

52
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,372
Cuff him.
Get him outta here.

53
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,727
Why?

54
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,742
You say you acted alone.

55
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:01,829
You say you shot and killed
two private security guards

56
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,289
in the commission of a robbery.

57
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:04,373
That is correct.

58
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,504
- Where's the gun?
- I said I don't know.

59
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,381
It just disappeared.

60
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,384
What about the six paintings
you cut out of their frames?

61
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,343
Did they disappear too?

62
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:23,642
Look. Nathaniel.

63
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,311
I know you're not the shooter,

64
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,230
so who are you trying
to protect? A girlfriend?

65
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:32,067
Is that it?

66
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,777
She must be a real good fuck.

67
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,447
I mean, you're willing to take
the injection for her.

68
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,157
Hmm?

69
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,659
You got a boyfriend?

70
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:45,331
You got a boyfriend, you sly devil.
You little faggot, you.

71
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:48,250
Actually, I don't have any friends.

72
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,837
What the fuck is wrong with you?

73
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,547
What the fuck are you
tryin' to pull here?

74
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:59,011
Why don't you just tell me what you'd like,
and I'll be happy to oblige.

75
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,388
The fuck you will,
you lyin' sack of shit!

76
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,265
You give me nothin' but horseshit!

77
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,064
I'm the one that asks
the questions here, not you!

78
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,315
Understood?

79
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,566
Yes.

80
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,778
Questions. Answers.

81
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,074
As intelligent a man as you are,

82
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,745
don't you wish your job
were a little more exciting?

83
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,335
Willet!

84
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,379
Yes, sir.

85
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,214
Get this asshole outta my face.

86
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,093
Let's go.

87
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,060
Guy gives me the willies.

88
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,315
In a case that continues
to baffle police officials,

89
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,776
Nathaniel Demarest pleaded
guilty this morning

90
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,279
to charges that he robbed
the Sarom Art Gallery

91
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,366
- and murdered two security guards.
- This is bullshit.

92
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:06,662
Judge Edward Lavwitz remanded Demarest
to county prison pending sentencing.

93
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:11,000
But questions still remain as to how
Demarest committed these crimes,

94
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,960
since a weapon was never found

95
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,796
nor have police discovered the whereabouts
the missing works of art.

96
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,967
As for the 3,000-year-old statue
damaged in the robbery,

97
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,761
experts are confident
it can be restored.

98
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:28,309
Called Ahura Mazda, it depicted
an ancient Persian deity of that name.

99
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,352
- I don't believe this.
- Meanwhile,

100
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:33,480
the family of slain security guard
Arnell Dawkins remain in seclusion.

101
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,816
Funeral arrangements
for the father of two

102
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,736
will be held along
with the other security guard.

103
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:41,864
Police Chief Howard said that there
will be a special ceremony

104
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:44,116
at City Hall to honor the officers.

105
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,869
- Reporting live from City Hall...
- shut up!

106
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,496
What's the matter in there?

107
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:50,057
- Is there something you'd like?
- Yeah!

108
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,226
How about your tight
little yuppie ass?

109
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,561
Oh, I'm no yuppie-

110
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,647
Don't fuck with me, bitch!

111
00:14:56,647 --> 00:15:00,526
I'll fuck up your life, you cocksucker.
You understand what I'm saying?

112
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:05,322
I believe you mean you'll do me
great bodily harm if I'm deceiving you.

113
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,450
Believe me, I'm not.
Make a wish.

114
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,078
- Any wish you like.
- Uh-huh?

115
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:15,999
All right. Uh, those are nice shoes.
What, are they some kind of English shit?

116
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,505
I don't know.

117
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,173
Take 'em off.

118
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,593
- Take the fuckin' shoes off, or...
- I like you.

119
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,930
You're a powerful man.

120
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,473
But you waste your power.

121
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,601
I'm giving you the chance
to wish for anything you like.

122
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:39,106
Anything in the world.
You can do better than a pair of shoes.

123
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,527
Whoa! Whoa!

124
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,071
You're a fuckin' genie!

125
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,283
Hey, fucking guy.
He's a fuckin' genie!

126
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:52,369
We got a fuckin' genie in our cell!
Hell, you're a genie, huh?

127
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,789
- Yes.
- All right. Okay. Fine.

128
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,959
Fine, because I'm gonna
make a wish.

129
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,504
If the wish don't come true,
I'm gonna own your lily white, yuppie,

130
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:05,090
motherfuckin', golf-playin' ass.

131
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,426
If the wish comes true,
I own you.

132
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:11,180
The fuckin' state owns me!

133
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,266
- Jesus Christ.
- All right.

134
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,894
Okay. Fine. Great.

135
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,937
You see the bars there?

136
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,524
I wanna walk right through the bars, man,

137
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,526
and walk right on outta the jail.

138
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,737
Come on. Come on, genie.

139
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:30,032
Done.

140
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:17,371
You woke me.

141
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:20,082
Fulfill the prophecy.

142
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,677
It's been a long time, Morgana.

143
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,599
Hello, Gregory.

144
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,897
Father.

145
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,401
You shouldn't be here.

146
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,780
It's still a church.

147
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:36,283
It's where I live.

148
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:40,996
I'm sorry to bother you, all right?

149
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,790
I just needed to talk,
and you're the only one...

150
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,753
Look, something's going on.

151
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,546
There's always something
going on with you, Morgana.

152
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,590
No.

153
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,426
No. This is different.

154
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:03,018
You know, this isn't the first time
I've been here since...

155
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,270
What is it you want
to talk to me about?

156
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,320
Do you...

157
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,617
Do you believe in the devil?

158
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:20,619
I believe in God.

159
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:24,915
Yeah. So if, um,

160
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:28,794
if God exists,
then Satan has to exist too, right?

161
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,339
Is there a point to this?

162
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,135
I don't even know.

163
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,487
Eric's dead.

164
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,413
Is that what you came here
to tell me?

165
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,290
Not really, no.

166
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,127
You know, you could
just say "I'm sorry."

167
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,130
I'm sorry.

168
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:18,552
But he wasn't
the right man for you.

169
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,013
I loved him.

170
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:25,350
- Do you really know what love is?
- Do you?

171
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,019
You couldn't love me,
and so you came here.

172
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,317
I'll tell you what real love is.

173
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:39,865
God so loved the world
that He gave His only begotten son...

174
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,701
I don't need a sermon, Gregory,
all right?

175
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:45,036
What do you need, Morgana?

176
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:47,831
I need answers.

177
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,210
I just don't know the questions yet.

178
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:59,676
Goodbye.

179
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:19,029
Yo, check this out.

180
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,947
I'm getting it on
with my sister-in-law, right.

181
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,950
Next thing I know the bitch
drops fucking dime on me.

182
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,578
Attempted rape.
I got this loser for a fuckin' P.D.,

183
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,497
and it's my third fuckin' hit.

184
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:31,416
That's fucked up, man.
Check this out, man.

185
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,752
I get stopped at a light.
They check in the trunk.

186
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,754
I get busted for a bogus search.

187
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:39,257
My lawyer plea-bargains three-to-five
when I should have fucking walked.

188
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,551
Punk-ass motherfucker
should go fuck himself.

189
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,179
- You're absolutely right.
- Who's the fuck is this guy?

190
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,058
Who you talkin' to,
you fuckin' faggot?

191
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,018
I'm talking to someone
who doesn't belong here.

192
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:59,277
I'm gonna do you a big favor because
you're new and you're ignorant,

193
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,947
and not rip the fuckin' tongue
out of your mouth for talkin' to me.

194
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,449
I'm going to do you a favor,

195
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:07,327
because you're an unjustly
imprisoned man.

196
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,372
You'd like to see your lawyer
paid for all the pain and suffering

197
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:11,498
he's put you through. Yes?

198
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,293
- Yo, man, are you tripping?
- Yes.

199
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,504
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm the Wishmaster.

200
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,256
I make wishes come true.

201
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:22,884
Oh, yeah? Well, you better wish
for some fuckin' sense real quick.

202
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:26,555
I believe you said you'd like to see
your lawyer go fuck himself.

203
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,515
I could arrange that.

204
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,352
Yo, man, you ain't playin' for real,
my boy here's...

205
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,521
I only play for real.

206
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:39,818
- What's in it for you?
- Your soul.

207
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:43,738
- Fuck it, man. Make it happen.
- Freeze.

208
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,992
Let's go, man.
Your lawyer's here.

209
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:49,911
- He wants to see you.
- Tell your friends.

210
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:52,873
Come on.
I said come on!

211
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,833
Get him outta here, man!

212
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:03,675
Well, well, well.
What do we have here, boys?

213
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,220
Wishmaster.

214
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,180
I like to flatter myself.

215
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,397
Flatter this, motherfucker.

216
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,318
Fuck off.

217
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:24,821
Now...

218
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:30,285
You wouldn't be tryin' to do any
business here, would you, bro?

219
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,372
Just trying to be helpful.

220
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,875
Is there something
I can help you with, brother?

221
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,793
I'm sure there is.

222
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,464
I'll be watchin' you.

223
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,424
Wishmaster.

224
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,970
Tinker Bell-lookin' motherfucker.

225
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:02,275
Hello, Robert. How's it goin'?

226
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:07,739
- You tell me.
- Well, actually, very well.

227
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:10,033
Oh, yeah.
Have a seat, please.

228
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:15,163
I think that I may have
some good news for ya.

229
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:18,667
Something about your case
didn't sit right with me.

230
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:19,960
It was the search.

231
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,171
It wasn't handled properly.
I did some digging.

232
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,340
And I uncovered
a procedural screwup

233
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,802
that's potentially very damaging
to the D.A.'s office.

234
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:33,181
I think that, uh, I can get all the charges
against you dropped.

235
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:36,309
Back up, man, back up.
What are you tellin' me?

236
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,478
You can get
all the charges dropped?

237
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:41,398
- That's right.
- What are you sayin', man? That I can go free?

238
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:45,652
That's right, Robert, and of course, you know,
with my connections at the police department

239
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,529
and the D.A.'s office, well,
you know, I can...

240
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,909
Goddamn, what was that?

241
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:56,162
- Are you okay, man?
- Yeah. Whoo!

242
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,040
Excuse me. Um, okay. Uh.

243
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,835
All right, yeah. We were... Ooh!

244
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,671
You okay?

245
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:08,383
Oh, God. Okay. We were talking...

246
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:11,678
Mister... Guard!

247
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:14,723
- Guard!
- Ohh!

248
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,517
Guard!
Yo, man, he's sick, man, he's sick!

249
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:20,687
Augh!

250
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:28,028
What the fuck?

251
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:33,742
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

252
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:41,916
What about my case, man?

253
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:46,337
What about my case, man?

254
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,300
Done.

255
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,449
Fulfill the prophecy.

256
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

257
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:04,457
Who are you?

258
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,418
Who the fuck are you!

259
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:12,423
God, this is bullshit.

260
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:40,827
Ahura Mazda.

261
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,997
"The deity of light in pre-Islamic Persia.

262
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:47,417
"His shadow was said to contain
all that was dark.

263
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,919
He thus came to symbolize
the duality of good and evil."

264
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,926
- Who is it?
- It's Gregory.

265
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,928
Come on up.

266
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:05,143
"Ahura Mazda was also known as

267
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:08,479
Keeper of the Stone
of the Secret Fire."

268
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:28,374
Never seen a girl
without her makeup before?

269
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:34,464
Father Dmitri told me you were outside
the church the other day.

270
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:37,675
Yeah. Um...

271
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:41,763
I was walking by,
and I decided to, uh...

272
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,765
Did you want to talk to me?

273
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,101
Not really, no.

274
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:50,855
You all right?

275
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:54,484
Yeah. I'm fine.

276
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:57,320
Only because Father Dmitri said
you seemed ill or...

277
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,865
I haven't been
sleeping well lately.

278
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:03,993
Still trying to find
the answers, huh?

279
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:06,996
The questions keep piling up.

280
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:10,250
I keep having these nightmares
and things.

281
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,169
People dying. A voice keeps saying,
"Fulfill the prophecy."

282
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:17,006
"Fulfill the prophecy"?

283
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:20,009
I keep thinking it has something
to do with Eric's death, you know?

284
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:23,513
Whatever.

285
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,560
Yeah. Actually, that's
why I wanted to come by.

286
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,814
I wanted to say I was sorry.

287
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:36,109
I was wrong, what I said to you
the other day about Eric.

288
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:39,862
My heart is truly with you.

289
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:45,451
I know.

290
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,500
The weird thing is
I'm not even sure he's dead.

291
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,546
I mean, there's been no reports.
Nothing on the news.

292
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,840
W-Wait a minute.

293
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,342
Maybe he's just missing.
Why do you presume he's dead?

294
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:04,053
Because I saw him shot.

295
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,389
What? Have you been to the police?

296
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,226
It was during a robbery.

297
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,314
I was part of it.

298
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:16,274
Oh, my God.

299
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,914
I killed the man
who shot him.

300
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,752
He left a wife and two kids.

301
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:39,339
And then I hear about this
Nathaniel Demarest guy,

302
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,007
arrested at the scene.

303
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:44,218
Confessing to everything.
I mean, the murders, everything!

304
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:48,639
W-Wait. You have to confess.
He's an innocent man.

305
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,475
I don't know what he is.

306
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:53,686
I thought at first maybe he was
a police plant or something.

307
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,855
But he keeps showing up
in my dreams!

308
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,690
Or whatever they are.

309
00:30:58,483 --> 00:30:59,317
Listen to me.

310
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:03,654
You have to confess.
It's your only way to find peace.

311
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:07,158
All I know is

312
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:09,327
I gotta find out who this guy is

313
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:12,205
and get him outta my life.

314
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:31,891
I need to see some I.D.

315
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,821
Holmes, we need detergent.

316
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:58,960
Mr. Demarest.

317
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:00,378
Yes?

318
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:02,296
I'm Osip Krutchkov.
How do you do?

319
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:04,507
I do very well, Mr. Krutchkov.
And you?

320
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:06,592
Oh, call me Osip.

321
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:11,139
I'm as well as I can be
in this fucking shit hole.

322
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,808
You'd like to be out of here, of course.

323
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:17,019
Who wants to be in prison
when he can be a free man?

324
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:18,604
Perhaps I could help.

325
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,190
So I am told.

326
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,150
Really?

327
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:24,318
What were you told?

328
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:25,945
That you are the devil.

329
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,865
That you take men's souls.

330
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,075
Did you believe them?

331
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:34,662
I don't give a shit
if you're devil or not.

332
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:39,625
As long as you will give me
what I need on this earth.

333
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:44,046
It is truly a pleasure to do business
with an enlightened man, Mr. Krutchkov.

334
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:47,133
Now, what can I do for you?

335
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:51,137
First, obviously,
I want to get out of here.

336
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:54,807
- Only one wish to a customer.
- Oh, Mr. Demarest.

337
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,226
I am not usual customer.

338
00:32:57,226 --> 00:33:00,480
Maybe not, but there are rules.

339
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,648
Rules are meant to be broken.

340
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,692
Help me, and I help you.

341
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:08,654
- Now, why would I need help?
- Everybody needs help.

342
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,615
Even the devil.

343
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:16,746
- What are you doin'?
- Oh, yes, sir. Just talking a little bit.

344
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,502
Demarest.

345
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:25,755
Let's go.

346
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,177
I'll catch you later, baby.

347
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,429
Yeah, I know what you mean.

348
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:52,490
You're gonna have a hearing
in about two weeks.

349
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:12,593
We meet again, Morgana.

350
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,764
How do you know my name?

351
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,517
I've been expecting you.

352
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:22,228
Where, exactly,
do you think we met?

353
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,480
In the art gallery.

354
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,819
That's bullshit.
I've never been there.

355
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:37,577
Why did you confess
to the robbery?

356
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:39,579
So you wouldn't have to, my dear.

357
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:43,624
- I don't follow you.
- Oh, I think you do.

358
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:47,420
We wouldn't want to talk about it too
loudly in here, now, would we?

359
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:52,258
You were there?

360
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,261
Indeed.

361
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:57,638
Hiding?

362
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:00,391
"Hidden," I think, is a better word.

363
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:03,978
Look, you're talking in circles.
I can't follow you.

364
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:05,396
You're right.

365
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,898
Why don't you ask me a question?

366
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,238
- What happened to Eric?
- The young man who was shot?

367
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:16,782
He had a regressive experience.

368
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:18,409
No. No riddles.

369
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:23,372
I'm sorry.
He's no longer with us.

370
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:29,629
Look, why would you take the rap
instead of me?

371
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:31,213
Access.

372
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,716
How could you have access to anybody?
You're in prison!

373
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:37,595
You're here.
Besides, this is only temporary,

374
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:41,515
and I've managed to gather up
a few like-minded souls.

375
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:46,520
Everybody wants something.
I love that part!

376
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:52,652
What does
"Fulfill the prophecy" mean?

377
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,945
You'll learn that
when the time is right.

378
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:58,199
What prophecy? And why me?
What is it about me?

379
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You set me free.

380
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:09,460
Are you all right, miss?

381
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,670
Yes, I'm fine.

382
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:16,300
Come on, asshole.

383
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:19,762
Come on.

384
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,478
Go ahead and put it over there.

385
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,984
There's this guy. Jackie T.

386
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:36,195
Plays it off like he's my boy.

387
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:40,032
Be sharin' stuff, talk shit about
what we're gonna do when we get out.

388
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:43,619
I tell him about my stash,
I tell him about my girl.

389
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:44,578
He gets out.

390
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:47,665
Next thing I know this fuckin' Sancho
is runnin' around with my bitch.

391
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:50,167
- And I don't know what else.
- That's no good.

392
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,335
No.

393
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:54,046
We really must do
something about that.

394
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:58,718
- What's it gonna take?
- Your soul.

395
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:03,723
And a pack of cigarettes.

396
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,522
Just take care of business, all right?

397
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:14,442
Done.

398
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:18,654
Hello, bro.

399
00:37:20,698 --> 00:37:23,534
See you been spreadin' your hustle
around my house.

400
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,246
- Yes.
- That's good.

401
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:30,291
'Cause I'm here for my rent.

402
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,752
- Your rent?
- My rent.

403
00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:35,379
My piece, my slice, my vig.

404
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:37,590
You just got a new partner,
motherfucker.

405
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,926
Not.
I prefer to work alone.

406
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:44,263
I don't think so.

407
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:47,391
I am prepared to offer you
something else, however.

408
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:51,854
You don't offer me shit!
I take, and I take, and I take!

409
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,230
Yes, of course.

410
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:57,067
What I meant to say was,
you can take anything you wish.

411
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,862
Is there something you'd
trade your soul for?

412
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,574
- My soul?
- Man, Butz don't have no soul.

413
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:05,367
Shut up!

414
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:08,412
Oh, yes, he does.

415
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:12,041
What'll it be, brother?
Power? Money?

416
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,001
Sex?

417
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:17,797
One more word outta you,
and I'm gonna shove my fist

418
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:21,091
so far down your fuckin' throat
you're gonna shit knuckles!

419
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:23,928
Nobody does business
in my fuckin' house

420
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:26,263
unless I get my rent.

421
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:29,350
Very well.

422
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:34,146
What else you got?

423
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,023
Hmm.

424
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,692
Hmm?

425
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,446
Don't you know these'll kill ya?

426
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:45,282
Your drugs!

427
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:47,743
I want your drugs.

428
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:50,162
Exactly which drugs would you like?

429
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,541
I don't give a damn.
I just wanna get wasted.

430
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:55,835
- Wasted?
- Wasted.

431
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:58,546
Fucked up.
Tore up from the floor up.

432
00:38:58,546 --> 00:39:01,173
Stomped right into the ground.

433
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:04,218
- Wasted.
- Mmm.

434
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,896
What the hell's the matter with you?

435
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,648
I don't know what the hell happened!

436
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:28,659
Wanna show me what you got,
motherfuckers?

437
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,286
Come on! Let's rock!

438
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:45,551
Careful what you wish for, brother.

439
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:54,643
That's how hard you can hit me?
Pow, pow!

440
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:57,938
Get outta here!
Can't take care of yourself?

441
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:01,108
Got to give your
a little butt a Tampax.

442
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:02,693
Mmm.

443
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:05,738
Damn.

444
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:11,076
Every time I have trouble
in my house,

445
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,162
I see your ugly face.

446
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:15,039
Now, what the hell
happened here?

447
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:17,291
Bad drugs.

448
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:20,711
Oh, you're a funny guy, huh?

449
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:22,796
Let's see how funny you are
with a week in the hole!

450
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:24,882
A week?

451
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:27,343
Is that the best you've got?

452
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:29,720
You want more? You got it, mister.

453
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,057
I was in a hole once for 3,000 years.

454
00:40:33,057 --> 00:40:35,935
This should be a breeze.

455
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:37,895
You're a fuckin' nut case.

456
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,314
I'm gonna take care of you.
Now, get his ass outta here!

457
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:42,775
Stuff his ass in the hole!

458
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:47,404
"According to legend,
an all-powerful Djinn

459
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:49,907
"laid waste to the court of Persia.

460
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:51,909
"As he prepared to scourge the earth

461
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:54,161
"and usurp the world for his own,

462
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:59,083
the king's alchemist created
the Stone of the Secret Fire."

463
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:09,927
"By incantation, the alchemist
imprisoned the Djinn

464
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:12,721
within the fire-red opal."

465
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:14,723
Fire-red opal.

466
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,191
"Lest the Djinn escape
again and bring on the apocalypse,

467
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:28,487
the god Ahura Mazda was enlisted
to guard the stone."

468
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:34,868
Oh, man.

469
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:40,124
"Guard the stone and keep the Djinn trapped
within the space between the worlds."

470
00:41:57,975 --> 00:42:00,853
I mean, I feel like
lam losing my mind.

471
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:05,232
I mean, the article on the Net says
there's this Stone of the Secret Fire

472
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:09,153
with this, Genie... this Djinn thing
locked inside it.

473
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:13,449
And it's guarded by this god,
Ahura Mazda.

474
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:17,870
Okay, well, I found the jewel
inside a statue of Ahura Mazda.

475
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,997
The jewel broke on my body.

476
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:23,417
Is that what Demarest meant
when he said I woke him?

477
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:25,544
I mean, from what?
From inside some stone?

478
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:28,464
And when I asked Demarest
who he was,

479
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:30,507
I got this... this flash...

480
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:34,553
of this hell
and this... this thing,

481
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:36,638
this Djinn, staring at me.

482
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:41,101
I mean, either this whole thing
is some kind of weird delusion,

483
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:42,978
in which case
I'm not sure I'm standing here,

484
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:45,856
or this guy is for real.

485
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:48,275
Well, in this flash,

486
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:51,195
how do you know this thing
you saw was a Djinn?

487
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:52,905
Because it looked just like
the thing in the article.

488
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:54,656
The one pictured in the article you read?

489
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:57,868
- No, wait a minute, Greg...
- No, no. The only reason I'm asking because

490
00:42:57,868 --> 00:43:00,829
you've been under a lot of stress
since Eric's death.

491
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:02,289
No, you didn't see this guy.

492
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,416
You didn't sit across the table from him

493
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:07,544
and look in his eyes and see...

494
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,963
I don't even know
how to describe it.

495
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:13,217
Maybe if you'd...

496
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:17,971
Forget it. Forget it.

497
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:22,351
No. No.

498
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:25,312
Maybe I should.

499
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,966
Open three!

500
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:59,012
Time's up, Demarest.
Let's go.

501
00:43:59,513 --> 00:44:00,764
Front and center.

502
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:07,771
Get him outta here.

503
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:49,479
Who are you?

504
00:44:57,696 --> 00:44:59,031
Who do you think I am?

505
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,160
Leave her alone.

506
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:04,995
Is that your wish?

507
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,333
I'm not askin' you. I'm tellin' you.
Leave her alone.

508
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,543
Like you left her alone, Father?

509
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:13,921
I know how you feel.

510
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:18,050
I'd like to get my hands
on that cute little ass myself.

511
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:21,970
You won't succeed.

512
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:23,972
Who's gonna stop me?

513
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:26,099
God will stop you.

514
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:28,602
God has nothing to do with this.

515
00:45:28,602 --> 00:45:31,313
God has everything
to do with this.

516
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:33,315
Begone, Satan!

517
00:45:33,315 --> 00:45:37,027
I think you have your demons
mixed up, Father.

518
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:46,161
Gregory, I want you. Gregory.

519
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,376
Tell Morgana I'll be in touch.

520
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:07,432
Gregory?

521
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:10,185
Gregory, are you okay?

522
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:12,813
He's not of this world.

00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:20,464
"this being the Assyrian number
for the apocalypse.

526
00:47:20,464 --> 00:47:24,343
"He does this by the granting of a wish.

527
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:26,970
"The souls are held
in a kind of purgatory

528
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:30,349
"until the requisite number are attained,
or the Djinn fails,

529
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:33,852
"in which case the souls are freed.

530
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:37,481
"Should the Djinn succeed,
he must then find the human

531
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:40,359
"who woke him into this world

532
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:42,486
"and grant him three wishes.

533
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:45,489
"Upon the granting of the third wish,

534
00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:49,034
"the Djinn may now bring forth
his race into our reality

535
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:50,827
"and overwhelm humanity,

536
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:53,038
as prophesied by the ancients."

537
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:56,416
Fulfill the prophecy.

538
00:47:57,918 --> 00:47:59,961
You asked me before
if I believed in the devil.

539
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,881
I do now.

540
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:05,008
So you think it's true.

541
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:08,261
If it isn't, thank God.

542
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:10,138
If it is...

543
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:12,391
God help us.

544
00:48:14,226 --> 00:48:16,895
You know, I couldn't figure out
why he'd want to go to prison.

545
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:20,315
Especially with all this power he has.

546
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:24,569
A lot of wishing going on in there.

547
00:48:26,113 --> 00:48:28,365
He's just biding his time,

548
00:48:28,365 --> 00:48:29,991
collecting his souls.

549
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,620
1,001 and then it's my turn.

550
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,333
All right.
What are we gonna do?

551
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,294
Hmm.

552
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:52,973
Augh!

553
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:54,808
- Okay!
- Uh... All right.

554
00:48:56,435 --> 00:48:57,436
Here.

555
00:48:57,436 --> 00:49:00,147
Thanks. I don't know
what I'm gonna do,

556
00:49:00,147 --> 00:49:02,274
but you've got to avoid
Demarest at all costs.

557
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,569
Yeah, well, that...

558
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:07,279
- Okay.
- May not be possible.

559
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:09,698
Well, whatever you do,

560
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:12,451
please don't wish for anything.

561
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:14,578
All right, that should be easy.

562
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:17,289
Is there a 12-step program
for wish-aholics?

563
00:49:17,873 --> 00:49:19,499
Yeah, it's called faith.

564
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,421
No. No, I brought him
into this world,

565
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:26,631
and I damn well
better get him out.

566
00:49:27,466 --> 00:49:29,259
The book says he can only
be returned to his own realm

567
00:49:29,259 --> 00:49:30,552
by someone who's...

568
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:32,345
Pure.

569
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:37,058
All right! So I got a little bit
of a problem there.

570
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:39,603
Gonna have to work on it.

571
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:41,855
Hmm.

572
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,608
Well, I'll tell you what.

573
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:47,652
You work on it from your end,

574
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,237
and I'll work on it from mine.

575
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:17,492
Purify my soul.

576
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:08,293
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

577
00:52:12,589 --> 00:52:13,715
Do a couple more reps.

578
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,555
Why are you so quiet today,
my friend?

579
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:22,807
Running out of customers?

580
00:52:23,642 --> 00:52:25,935
It appears I've exhausted
my consumer base.

581
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:30,940
Oh. So the rest of those morons
are not so stupid that they look.

582
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:35,111
On the contrary, they're more stupid
than you can imagine.

583
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:38,198
Checkmate.

584
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:43,244
Well, time to blow
this Popsicle stand.

585
00:52:44,037 --> 00:52:46,373
Amazing! I woke up
with the same idea.

586
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,041
Shall we go, then?

587
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:51,419
Oh, yes. Sure. How?

588
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:53,463
Walk out the front gate.

589
00:52:54,464 --> 00:52:55,423
Just like that?

590
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:56,591
Yes.

591
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,512
- All you have to do is wish it.
- You said I get two wishes. Remember?

592
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:03,056
You make a wish.

593
00:53:03,056 --> 00:53:06,726
I get your soul.
After that, we'll see.

594
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,687
To be continued.

595
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:10,772
- Get your butt out of here.
- Sorry, sir.

596
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,899
You're a naughty little girl.
You hear what I'm sayin'?

597
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:15,068
And Daddy gonna teach
you some respect!

598
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:16,903
This is my house.

599
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:19,656
And ever since you been here,
there's been nothin' but trouble.

600
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,867
There's been four murders.
There's been an increase of contraband.

601
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:25,787
There's been a lack of discipline.
You're not foolin' me, man!

602
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,082
You think this shit's funny?

603
00:53:31,084 --> 00:53:32,419
I got a place here called "hell"

604
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:35,547
that'll make your week in the hole
like a walk in the park.

605
00:53:36,506 --> 00:53:39,634
- Been there.
- Oh, you think you're a tough guy.

606
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:40,885
When I close them doors,

607
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:43,054
I'm gonna have you cryin' for your mama
like a little bitch.

608
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:45,306
Sounds great, sir,

609
00:53:45,974 --> 00:53:47,600
but I've made other plans.

610
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:51,187
You just got a month in hell.

611
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:54,274
I'm gonna keep you there till the rats
eat your damn eyes out.

612
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:56,359
Is that your wish, sir?

613
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:57,777
That's my order.

614
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:02,115
- I tell you what my wish is.
- I'm all ears.

615
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:10,415
I wish I could slow dance with you
for one minute, alone, Compton style.

616
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:13,877
Done.

617
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:24,429
Oh, my God.

618
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:32,228
Shall we dance?

619
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:51,664
Krutchkov.

620
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:54,626
Yes, sir!

621
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,212
Krutchkov, how badly do you
wanna leave this prison?

622
00:54:58,129 --> 00:54:59,714
No, sir. I am happy here.

623
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:03,510
Yes. I am happy.
Everything is fine, you know?

624
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,094
American prison is the best
in the world.

625
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:08,640
ls it your
wish to blow this Popsicle stand?

626
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:12,894
Demarest?

627
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:22,278
Make your wish.

628
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,698
Are you fucking too much?

629
00:55:27,242 --> 00:55:28,451
Yes.

630
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:31,162
Open sesame.

631
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:54,519
Morgana!
My God.

632
00:55:55,979 --> 00:55:56,938
What happened to your hand?

633
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,732
I had to cast out my own devils first.

634
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:01,025
Look, he escaped.

635
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:02,443
What! When?

636
00:56:02,694 --> 00:56:06,322
This morning. I think he has all the souls.
ls that why he got out?

637
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:08,283
I don't know, maybe he needs more
and can't find any takers.

638
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:09,659
A thousand's a pretty big number.

639
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:11,077
Yeah, well, not big enough.

640
00:56:13,121 --> 00:56:15,081
You know, all the books say that
when the apocalypse is very near,

641
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:16,541
the nature of the world will change.

642
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:17,917
I haven't seen that yet.

643
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:20,253
I don't think anything
this guy does is random.

644
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:22,755
- Tell me. How did he escape?
- They don't know yet.

645
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:25,633
This guard was killed.
He was mutilated.

646
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,552
He left with this other guy,
this Russian man...

647
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:28,469
Wait wait wait.

648
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:30,471
- A Russian. What was his name?
- I don't know.

649
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:32,599
You know what, It's gotta be
in the papers by now.

650
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:42,108
Here it is. Osip Krutchkov.

651
00:56:42,901 --> 00:56:43,776
I know that name.

652
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,863
Krutchkov. He murdered
two men in my parish.

653
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,197
Wait, what, he lives here?

654
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:50,992
I... I can't say. I just... I
used to hang out at this club...

655
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:53,828
Um, Siberia. Club Siberia.

656
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:57,165
- Wait, the place on Third.
- Yeah.

657
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:11,763
Hey! Hey!
My droog Nathaniel! Here!

658
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,641
Drink.

659
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:20,855
- No, thank you.
- Come on.

660
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:23,816
What the hell
kind of devil are you?

661
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:30,531
You know, he's the devil,
this son of a bitch.

662
00:57:31,574 --> 00:57:33,993
He can give you
anything that you want.

663
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:38,331
Money, Pavel?
Hmm? Huh?

664
00:57:38,331 --> 00:57:41,417
You want...

665
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:46,047
You want a big dick,
my little friend Misha?

666
00:57:46,047 --> 00:57:49,968
Huh? You want it?
He can give it to you.

667
00:57:59,102 --> 00:58:01,020
Get out of here.

668
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:03,648
Get out, I told you!

669
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:05,942
Misha, I said to get out of here!

670
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:09,570
This fuckin' son of bitch!
Get out of here!

671
00:58:17,203 --> 00:58:19,998
Nothing. Just...

672
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:15,011
You speak Russian.

673
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:18,848
Why are you so afraid
of Pushkin?

674
00:59:21,184 --> 00:59:23,061
Everybody is afraid of Pushkin.

675
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:27,565
He's a big boss.

676
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:34,697
I despise Pushkin!

677
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:46,292
Make me big boss.

678
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:49,420
Get rid of this fucking Pushkin.

679
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:53,132
I wish I want to be big boss.

680
00:59:54,217 --> 00:59:55,968
You've already had your wish.

681
00:59:56,511 --> 00:59:58,179
One more, please.

682
00:59:59,055 --> 01:00:00,181
Sorry.

683
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:03,017
There are rules
not even I can break.

684
01:00:12,235 --> 01:00:13,319
Come with me.

685
01:00:14,237 --> 01:00:16,906
Please. Come.

686
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:19,075
Mmm.

687
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:43,891
Is this true?

688
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:47,436
Absolutely.

689
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:49,689
Just ask.

690
01:00:51,941 --> 01:00:54,986
Why?
What you get from this?

691
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:57,697
The pleasure of seeing you
achieve your end.

692
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:02,827
You are the most
interesting character.

693
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:05,079
Yes, I am.

694
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:11,961
- There is nothing I need.
- Surely there's something you want.

695
01:01:12,128 --> 01:01:15,798
Fame, fortune, power.

696
01:01:17,383 --> 01:01:19,468
Fortune and power I already have.

697
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:22,054
Fame I don't need.

698
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:23,806
Excuse me.

699
01:01:25,892 --> 01:01:27,435
Maybe a woman you couldn't get.

700
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:31,063
Some object of great value.

701
01:01:32,899 --> 01:01:35,067
Perhaps you'd like an enemy
to disappear.

702
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:39,322
I don't need you for that.
You're wasting my time.

703
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:41,908
Moustafa!

704
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:47,788
I told you! Never mention his name
in my presence!

705
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:50,958
Nathaniel can get to him, really.

706
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:55,504
Somebody who's offended you.
Someone you can't touch.

707
01:02:06,307 --> 01:02:08,226
Moustafaranski's gang out of Chechnya.

708
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:13,272
What could you do against Moustafa?

709
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:15,024
Anything you wish.

710
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:29,288
I want his head.

711
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:31,666
Can you do this?

712
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:33,751
Consider it done.

713
01:03:02,697 --> 01:03:04,782
Moustafa!

714
01:03:07,535 --> 01:03:08,577
Get out of here!

715
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:12,748
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

716
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:18,004
Take him out of here.

717
01:03:18,004 --> 01:03:22,383
Moustafa! Moustafa!

718
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:24,760
I did it!

719
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:29,181
On his Wish I did it! Ha-ha!

720
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:33,102
Ah, now I am the boss,
number one!

721
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:35,313
What?

722
01:03:37,273 --> 01:03:40,735
I got what I want.
You get what you want.

723
01:03:41,277 --> 01:03:44,030
- And what would that be?
- One more soul.

724
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:46,240
One more soul?

725
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,952
I need 800 more souls,
and I'm growing impatient.

726
01:03:50,453 --> 01:03:52,204
Oh, wait, wait.

727
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:56,792
Go on the street and take them.
You're powerful.

728
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:59,128
I can only act
when I'm wished to do so,

729
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:01,255
but that will change very soon.

730
01:04:01,714 --> 01:04:04,425
My droog Nathaniel, wait.

731
01:04:04,425 --> 01:04:06,552
You need souls.

732
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:09,889
I have such a great place for you.

733
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:36,040
Lovely to see you again, Morgana.

734
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:38,876
Did you really think
you could kill me?

735
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:43,381
Evil never dies.

736
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:47,468
Perhaps there is something else you desire.

737
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:54,934
Your dead friend Eric alive again.

738
01:04:56,477 --> 01:04:57,311
No.

739
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:01,357
There will come a time, soon,

740
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:05,945
when I will call upon you
to fulfill the prophecy...

741
01:05:05,945 --> 01:05:07,530
you who woke me.

742
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:10,074
Three wishes you will make.

743
01:05:10,074 --> 01:05:13,994
Then my kingdom
will reign on this earth.

744
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:16,622
For now,

745
01:05:16,622 --> 01:05:19,875
this wish I give you freely

746
01:05:21,085 --> 01:05:23,254
so you may know its joy.

747
01:05:24,547 --> 01:05:26,298
Tell me your desire, child.

748
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:29,927
I shall grant it.

749
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:32,304
No!

750
01:05:42,106 --> 01:05:43,691
Souls, Krutchkov.

751
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:46,944
I need souls.

752
01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:19,602
God, forgive me.

753
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:24,815
God forgives all sin.

754
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:28,819
Some sins are too great,

755
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:31,155
even for God.

756
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:34,909
No sin is too great
for his forgiveness.

757
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:38,078
I killed an innocent man.

758
01:06:40,498 --> 01:06:42,041
I left two children fatherless.

759
01:06:44,919 --> 01:06:47,630
I have blood on my hands
I can never wash out.

760
01:06:49,507 --> 01:06:51,967
The blood of the Lamb
can cleanse all sins.

761
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:53,177
No, not mine!

762
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:57,014
I brought him into this world.

763
01:06:59,934 --> 01:07:00,976
And I'm too weak.

764
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:04,563
I'm too impure to get him out.

765
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:09,860
I pray to God for forgiveness,

766
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:13,864
but I can't hear his voice.

767
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:17,159
Morgana, listen to me.

768
01:07:19,245 --> 01:07:20,371
It's in God's hands.

769
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:22,831
If it's His will
that you serve him, so be it.

770
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:24,416
I saw his true face.

771
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:27,378
The face of God?

772
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:30,839
The Djinn.

773
01:07:36,554 --> 01:07:39,014
I found Demarest and...

774
01:07:40,641 --> 01:07:42,268
I tried to kill him.

775
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:44,687
My God.

776
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:48,899
And when I shot him,

777
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:51,110
he changed.

778
01:07:55,698 --> 01:07:57,241
Those pictures of the Djinn...

779
01:07:59,535 --> 01:08:01,245
there's no way to fight him.

780
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:04,331
For us, no.

781
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:08,460
For God, through us...

782
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:36,822
Hey! Come in.

783
01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:40,951
It's okay.

784
01:08:43,037 --> 01:08:45,998
A priest can't do you
any good, girlie.

785
01:08:46,999 --> 01:08:48,042
He's gone.

786
01:08:48,876 --> 01:08:49,710
Where?

787
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,964
I'm afraid I can't
tell you that, Father.

788
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:55,215
Why not?

789
01:08:57,551 --> 01:08:58,510
What are you afraid of?

790
01:09:00,596 --> 01:09:01,930
I made a pledge.

791
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:03,641
You made a pledge?

792
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:05,893
You sit before God, and you tell me
you made a pledge

793
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:08,062
with this... this evil?

794
01:09:08,062 --> 01:09:10,898
I don't see God in this room.

795
01:09:10,898 --> 01:09:13,901
I just see a poor priest...

796
01:09:13,901 --> 01:09:15,944
and a pathetic little girl.

797
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:19,740
You want to save the world?
I show you how to save the world!

798
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:22,993
Just... Just put the gun down.

799
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:27,039
If she's dead, she can't
wish this world into hell.

800
01:09:27,706 --> 01:09:29,583
- He's right.
- No! Put the gun down.

801
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:31,919
No, it's the only way to stop him.

802
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:33,712
I can't let you!
Put the gun down.

803
01:09:34,129 --> 01:09:36,173
Aah!

804
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:40,135
No!

805
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:45,474
There's nothing there.

806
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:51,522
Oh, he has other plans for you.

807
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:55,901
How many souls?

808
01:09:57,778 --> 01:10:00,030
How many souls does he have?
Did he say?

809
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:04,785
You made a wish, right?

810
01:10:04,785 --> 01:10:07,287
You want to spend eternity
in his hell?

811
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:10,916
Then help us!
Help yourself!

812
01:10:14,795 --> 01:10:18,465
He said he needs 800 more.

813
01:10:22,845 --> 01:10:24,930
- That gives us some time, right?
- Yeah.

814
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:27,516
Not where he's going.

815
01:10:32,938 --> 01:10:34,231
I understand
you'll be representing our

816
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:36,400
Eastern European partners
while you're out here.

817
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,986
Yes, indeed. Quite so.

818
01:10:38,986 --> 01:10:42,072
Do you have any experience
in the, uh, gaming industry, Mr. Demarest?

819
01:10:42,531 --> 01:10:43,907
Oh, yes.

820
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:46,744
- Whoo!
- Congratulations, Tex.

821
01:10:46,744 --> 01:10:47,745
Thank you, partner.

822
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:50,581
Yeah, we like folks to win.

823
01:10:51,165 --> 01:10:55,294
Anything that encourages
our other guests to bet is good for us.

824
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:58,255
Since the house
has the advantage,

825
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:00,090
eventually they all lose.

826
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:02,968
Now, what a wonderful business.

827
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:05,512
Yeah, we like to think so.

828
01:11:09,767 --> 01:11:11,226
In fact, you might say

829
01:11:11,226 --> 01:11:14,563
the casino wishes everyone
the best of luck.

830
01:11:14,563 --> 01:11:17,483
The casino wishes
everyone the best of luck?

831
01:11:17,483 --> 01:11:19,693
- Most assuredly.
- How nice.

832
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,862
Mr. and Mrs. Lee.

833
01:11:21,862 --> 01:11:24,114
How are you?
How's the suite?

834
01:11:24,114 --> 01:11:26,867
Gimme them bones, gimme them bones.
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.

835
01:11:26,867 --> 01:11:28,952
Come on, seven. Come on, seven!

836
01:11:29,328 --> 01:11:30,162
Come on, seven!

837
01:11:30,996 --> 01:11:32,247
Yeah!

838
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:36,293
Ka-Ching.

839
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:45,344
Hello?

840
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:48,055
This is Osip Krutchkov.

841
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:51,058
I am so sorry. I must talk to you.

842
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:53,936
What do you want?

843
01:11:54,228 --> 01:11:57,397
You must go to him
before he gets all his souls.

844
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:00,025
I have purchased you a ticket.

845
01:12:00,025 --> 01:12:04,279
<i>Please, I beg you.
You must go, now.</i>

846
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,532
Yeah, right.

847
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:08,575
I also need one
for Father Gregory.

848
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:12,329
Both
tickets will be waiting at the airport.

849
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:15,958
Goodbye, Morgana, and thank you.

850
01:12:23,632 --> 01:12:24,675
This is it, Gregory.

851
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:26,343
Do you really think we can do this?

852
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:28,136
Yeah.

853
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:30,514
It says here that the king's
alchemist from Persia

854
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:33,517
got the Djinn back into the gem
through an incantation.

855
01:12:33,725 --> 01:12:35,435
Now, what incantation?

856
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:40,774
"And as it was prophesied, the alchemist
took the stone unto his hand,

857
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:43,694
"as a woman pure of heart takes
the light of God unto her soul,

858
01:12:43,861 --> 01:12:47,614
"and spoke the words
Nib sugaroth baheim,

859
01:12:47,906 --> 01:12:50,284
upon which the Djinn was again
imprisoned within the opal." there it is.

860
01:12:50,492 --> 01:12:53,412
All right, so you figure if you just
say those words, um...

861
01:12:53,412 --> 01:12:55,956
Nib sugaroth baheim.

862
01:12:55,956 --> 01:12:57,708
Yeah, the Djinn is just
gonna disappear?

863
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:00,127
Yeah... no... well, yeah... I mean
he goes back inside the opal.

864
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:03,463
But if the king's alchemist can do it,
then so can we. Why can't we?

865
01:13:03,714 --> 01:13:06,133
Because he knew
what he was doing.

866
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:11,179
At least you're pure of heart.

867
01:13:14,975 --> 01:13:16,310
Look, Gregory,

868
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:19,021
the world as we know it
is about to come to an end,

869
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:22,024
and you're gonna stop the Djinn
by using a quotation

870
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:23,942
from a book you bought
at the Spell-Checker?

871
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:27,988
What else have we got?

872
01:13:37,331 --> 01:13:40,834
Morgana, I really don't think
this is the way to heaven.

873
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:43,337
Don't be too sure.

874
01:14:16,495 --> 01:14:17,454
Magic.

875
01:15:01,415 --> 01:15:02,624
What the fuck is goin' on?

876
01:15:02,624 --> 01:15:03,834
I don't know, Mr. Farralon.

877
01:15:06,795 --> 01:15:10,007
All right, dealer. Let's see what you got!
Come on! Let's see what you got!

878
01:15:10,507 --> 01:15:11,717
Go ahead!

879
01:15:11,717 --> 01:15:13,260
Yeah!

880
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:59,473
I claim that which is owed.

881
01:16:09,316 --> 01:16:11,860
Fulfill the prophecy.

882
01:16:29,461 --> 01:16:31,254
Morgana, what is it?

883
01:16:53,819 --> 01:16:56,613
What is it?

884
01:17:02,244 --> 01:17:03,954
Aah!

885
01:17:13,964 --> 01:17:15,090
It's over.

886
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:20,053
He has all the souls.

887
01:17:26,977 --> 01:17:29,354
If we stay calm,
no one will get hurt.

888
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,606
We all wanted
something for nothing.

889
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:33,692
And that's what they got.

890
01:17:35,986 --> 01:17:39,489
All right, it's showtime.
Let's go.

891
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,706
Three wishes, Morgana,

892
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:51,084
and I shall reign.

893
01:18:04,347 --> 01:18:05,849
Come in.

894
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,946
I trust you didn't find the disturbance
downstairs too upsetting.

895
01:18:21,907 --> 01:18:24,242
Is that what you have in mind
if your kingdom comes?

896
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:27,287
Well, you know what
they say, Father.

897
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:29,706
"What goes around comes around."

898
01:18:32,334 --> 01:18:33,501
Do you like to gamble?

899
01:18:35,921 --> 01:18:37,422
Depends on what's at stake.

900
01:18:38,215 --> 01:18:39,090
Anything you wish.

901
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:42,677
The casino would be happy
to offer you unlimited credit

902
01:18:42,677 --> 01:18:44,596
to play the game of your choice.

903
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:47,682
I have a feeling
you'll do very well.

904
01:18:47,682 --> 01:18:48,934
I can feel it.

905
01:18:49,684 --> 01:18:52,437
Matter of fact,
I can guarantee it.

906
01:18:53,438 --> 01:18:55,857
Save your games
for the people downstairs.

907
01:18:57,692 --> 01:18:58,902
Hm.

908
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:05,075
So you want me
to make a wish?

909
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:08,036
Three, to be exact.

910
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:13,500
All right.

911
01:19:15,585 --> 01:19:16,753
I wish...

912
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:20,799
you were gone forever!

913
01:19:23,718 --> 01:19:24,844
Poof!

914
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:26,972
Hmm.

915
01:19:26,972 --> 01:19:28,139
Still here.

916
01:19:29,641 --> 01:19:32,686
A wish cannot change
that which is eternal.

917
01:19:33,853 --> 01:19:35,397
Please wish again.

918
01:19:37,524 --> 01:19:39,192
You can do better.

919
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:45,365
I wish... I wish you back into
the Stone of the Secret Fire.

920
01:19:46,157 --> 01:19:47,617
I see you've done your homework.

921
01:19:48,285 --> 01:19:51,037
Unfortunately for you,
it's not that easy.

922
01:19:52,122 --> 01:19:54,165
After all,
I am the Wishmaster here.

923
01:19:54,165 --> 01:19:59,212
So any wishes pertaining to me
are circumscribed by the prophecy.

924
01:20:05,677 --> 01:20:07,554
Nib sugaroth baheim.

925
01:20:10,515 --> 01:20:13,268
So, we have done our homework.

926
01:20:19,107 --> 01:20:22,652
Do not play with forces
you don't understand,

927
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:25,613
or you will suffer
the consequences.

928
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:29,868
You don't frighten us.

929
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:32,996
God's already sent you
once back to hell.

930
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:34,664
Oh, please.

931
01:20:35,582 --> 01:20:37,625
Not that old story again.

932
01:20:38,168 --> 01:20:40,545
Hell is your world, not mine.

933
01:20:47,469 --> 01:20:50,096
In God's name, I command
you out of this world.

934
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:52,766
I wish you into hell, Demarest.

935
01:20:54,976 --> 01:20:55,852
Gotcha.

936
01:21:02,776 --> 01:21:05,028
Welcome to my world, Morgana.

937
01:21:14,621 --> 01:21:15,580
Where's Gregory?

938
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:17,957
Where he's always wanted to be.

939
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,794
Behold the man.

940
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:31,971
What good is your faith now?

941
01:21:37,811 --> 01:21:38,895
What have you done?

942
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:42,857
Nothing that can't be undone, child.
Just ask.

943
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:46,027
Let him go.

944
01:21:47,028 --> 01:21:48,488
Let him go, please.

945
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:50,698
Is that your wish?

946
01:21:53,076 --> 01:21:55,203
No.

947
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,914
Then watch him suffer.

948
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:00,208
Aah!

949
01:22:05,505 --> 01:22:06,840
I wish you to release him.

950
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:09,592
Done.

951
01:22:10,176 --> 01:22:11,678
Gregory!

952
01:22:13,012 --> 01:22:15,140
Oh, God! Gregory!

953
01:22:17,225 --> 01:22:19,727
Oh, God.

954
01:22:21,521 --> 01:22:23,356
You said you'd release him!

955
01:22:23,898 --> 01:22:25,358
And so I shall.

956
01:22:31,531 --> 01:22:33,491
Gregory?

957
01:22:37,996 --> 01:22:38,955
You bastard!

958
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:41,666
Two more wishes.

959
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,252
Go fuck yourself in hell.

960
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:47,839
Make your wishes.

961
01:22:48,923 --> 01:22:49,757
Never.

962
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:53,261
You tax my patience, child.

963
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:02,353
I wish there was no evil
in the world.

964
01:23:03,605 --> 01:23:06,357
Evil is the half
of a perfect sphere.

965
01:23:07,108 --> 01:23:09,819
- Try again.
- Tell me how to stop you!

966
01:23:10,195 --> 01:23:11,529
We've been through all that.

967
01:23:12,614 --> 01:23:16,159
You're wasting my time now,
and you're pissing me off!

968
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:19,120
Make your wish!

969
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:21,623
Fulfill the prophecy.

970
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:32,217
All right. I understand.

971
01:23:38,056 --> 01:23:39,516
You've had a tough day.

972
01:23:42,227 --> 01:23:43,436
Hmm.

973
01:23:44,646 --> 01:23:46,981
I can see how

974
01:23:46,981 --> 01:23:49,150
this could get a little depressing
in here, couldn't it?

975
01:23:51,486 --> 01:23:53,613
This place isn't exactly...

976
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:54,822
happy-

977
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:57,033
I know.

978
01:23:58,117 --> 01:24:00,954
What we need is a more
wish-provoking environment.

979
01:24:03,748 --> 01:24:04,874
Ross.

980
01:24:08,169 --> 01:24:11,172
Can you believe this?
First a run on the house.

981
01:24:11,172 --> 01:24:14,968
Now 200 people drop dead
all at once?

982
01:24:14,968 --> 01:24:17,845
- What's next? Frogs and locusts?
- Could be.

983
01:24:18,471 --> 01:24:20,890
- We're finished!
- Not yet, Ross.

984
01:24:21,474 --> 01:24:24,143
What we need is some more action.
Good for business.

985
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:26,271
Come on. Don't you wish we had
some real action?

986
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:28,565
No! No, don't!

987
01:24:30,358 --> 01:24:32,944
- Who's she?
- An acquaintance.

988
01:24:32,944 --> 01:24:35,029
Don't listen to him.
He's the devil.

989
01:24:36,364 --> 01:24:37,740
So, what do you say, Ross?

990
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:39,951
No, don't say anything.
It's a trick.

991
01:24:41,327 --> 01:24:44,163
You know, Nathaniel,

992
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:46,332
I think I've had about all the action
that I can handle.

993
01:24:49,711 --> 01:24:53,506
I just wish I could see this nightmare
come to an end.

994
01:24:53,798 --> 01:24:54,674
No!

995
01:25:13,234 --> 01:25:14,819
Hurry up! Help!

996
01:25:41,804 --> 01:25:43,139
Look out!

997
01:25:56,444 --> 01:25:58,780
Get out!
This place is damned!

998
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:00,448
Everyone out!

999
01:26:23,638 --> 01:26:26,391
Too bad.
You just crapped out.

1000
01:26:46,786 --> 01:26:49,288
Ahh.

1001
01:26:49,288 --> 01:26:52,709
"Ooh!

1002
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:21,696
Do you wish to see more?

1003
01:27:24,198 --> 01:27:26,701
- No.
- Then end it.

1004
01:27:27,702 --> 01:27:30,329
Make your wishes.

1005
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,250
I don't even know
what to ask for.

1006
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:37,587
Ask for your heart's desires.

1007
01:27:38,212 --> 01:27:39,630
A million dollars?

1008
01:27:40,548 --> 01:27:41,924
A bird's nest?

1009
01:27:42,467 --> 01:27:46,220
To see your lover priest
one last time?

1010
01:27:54,812 --> 01:27:58,274
You said, "Fulfill the prophecy."
what prophecy?

1011
01:27:58,483 --> 01:28:00,985
I have no more time, child.

1012
01:28:01,736 --> 01:28:03,946
You told me I'd know the answer
when the time was right.

1013
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:09,076
It is written,

1014
01:28:09,076 --> 01:28:11,746
"that one who wakes the Djinn

1015
01:28:11,746 --> 01:28:14,916
"shall have three wishes.

1016
01:28:14,916 --> 01:28:18,002
"Upon granting all three,

1017
01:28:18,002 --> 01:28:22,632
the race of Djinn
shall inherit the earth."

1018
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:27,595
And as was prophesied,

1019
01:28:27,595 --> 01:28:32,725
"the alchemist took the stone
unto his hand,

1020
01:28:32,725 --> 01:28:37,480
"as a woman pure of heart takes
the light of God unto her soul,

1021
01:28:38,523 --> 01:28:39,941
"and spoke the words,

1022
01:28:39,941 --> 01:28:43,486
Nib sugaroth baheim."

1023
01:28:55,289 --> 01:28:58,125
I wish the man I shot
was alive again.

1024
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:02,588
Done.

1025
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:09,178
- Ah.
- Daddy! Daddy!

1026
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:17,478
That's good.

1027
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:27,196
Nib sugaroth baheim.

1028
01:29:31,868 --> 01:29:34,954
Nib sugaroth baheim.

1029
01:29:36,497 --> 01:29:38,457
Nib sugaroth baheim.

1030
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:43,004
Nib sugaroth baheim!

1031
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:52,263
Nib sugaroth baheim!

1032
01:29:56,934 --> 01:29:59,186
Nib sugaroth baheim!

1033
01:30:06,611 --> 01:30:09,030
Nib sugaroth baheim.

1034
01:31:47,795 --> 01:31:50,589
Gregory, he's gone.
