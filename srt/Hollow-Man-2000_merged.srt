1
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,130
<i>Òhey have this All Bird TV.
You seen it?</i>

2
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,029
<i>No.
- Sure, it's All Bird TV.</i>

3
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,931
<i>I'm giving them a plug.</i>

4
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,904
<i>It's all birds. I watch it with the cat,
the cat, fixated by it.</i>

5
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,458
Damn it!

6
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,389
Damn it.

7
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:15,204
I am a goddamn genius.

8
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,488
Oh, my God.

9
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,468
Sebastian, do you have any idea
what time it is?

10
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,737
Da Vinci never slept.
Said it was a waste of time.

11
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,503
Who's that?

12
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,870
Not your business.

13
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:48,736
<i>Not anymore.</i>

14
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:51,807
Linda...

15
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,017
<i>...I cracked the reversión.</i>

16
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,713
You cracked it?

17
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,013
<i>Look at this.</i>

18
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,856
<i>Watch.</i>

19
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,997
Eleven months and you suddenly
come up with it out of the blue? How?

20
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,101
The usual. Coffee and Twinkies.

21
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,069
<i>I hate you.</i>

22
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,372
Can you find Matt and get to the lab?
I want Isabelle for a live test.

23
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,382
I think I can find him.

24
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,676
<i>When will you be in?</i>

25
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,352
Well, it should be daylight
in Sweden now.

26
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:33,684
So I should call the Nobel committee
and tell them to get our prize ready.

27
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,561
<i>I'll see you in a few.</i>

28
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,570
Matt.

29
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,231
Sebastian called.
We gotta get to the lab.

30
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,337
What's the rush?

31
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:50,666
He cracked reversión.

32
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,103
You're kidding.

33
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,108
When?
- While we were sleeping.

34
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,214
You want a ride?

35
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,344
Maybe we should take our own cars.

36
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,483
I'm tired of this
sneaking around, Lin.

37
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,750
You're gonna have to tell him
eventually.

38
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,494
I will, eventually.

39
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,630
I'm just waiting for the right time.

40
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,392
With Sebastian, there's never
gonna be a right time.

41
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,881
Morning, Dr. Caine.
- Morning.

42
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,144
Have a nice day, sir.
- Thank you.

43
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,765
Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Ed.

44
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,375
Your team's in early today.
Something special?

45
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,136
Sorry, Ed. You know the rules.

46
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,616
<i>Authorization, please.
- Caine, 0027.</i>

47
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,120
<i>Confirmed.</i>

48
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,382
Hi.

49
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,726
Isabelle.

50
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,380
Come on, Isabelle.

51
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,919
Calm down, baby.

52
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,960
Good girl.

53
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,604
It's okay.

54
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,935
I'm not gonna hurt you.

55
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,478
Hold still.

56
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,408
Isabelle?

57
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,634
She's more aggressive these days.

58
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:49,403
That's what tranquillizers are for.
I'll get her.

59
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,845
She's been gone too long.
It's starting to affect her brain.

60
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,621
You take care of that bite.
- I'll manage.

61
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,619
Hey.

62
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,954
Ten bucks says I nail her first.

63
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,524
You're on.

64
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,470
Isabelle?

65
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,504
Got a surprise for you.

66
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,028
You missed.

67
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,300
Maybe because I don't spend
my lunch hours practicing.

68
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,629
You owe me ten.

69
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,135
Put it on my tab.

70
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,740
You know, someday I may actually
make you pay up.

71
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,579
Sarah's on the warpath,
so you play nice.

72
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,880
This is bullshit, Sebastian.
- And good morning to you too.

73
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,881
Get the monkey on the table.

74
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:11,562
How can you justify injecting Isabelle
with the serum without even testing it?

75
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,091
Because it'll save time.

76
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,060
Then you can mop up afterwards.

77
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,565
You think I'm trying to kill Isabelle?

78
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,897
Kill? More like liquefy.
- Lab's prepped.

79
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:25,209
Well, your objections are duly noted
and summarily overruled.

80
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,877
Yes, sir.

81
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,184
How come when you say, 'Yes, sir,'
it sounds like 'Fuck you'?

82
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:33,909
Practice.

83
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,082
How'd you convince me to hire her?

84
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,220
You wanted the best vet in the U.S.

85
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:43,792
She cares more about the animals.
- And maybe that's why she's so good.

86
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,530
So this guy you're seeing,
what's he like?

87
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,564
He's everything you're not.

88
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,235
He must be dull.

89
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,755
Ready in 40.
- Okay.

90
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,560
Vitals?

91
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,730
All normal.

92
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,331
Using the word 'normal' loosely,
of course.

93
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,660
Emergency medical, standing by.
- Tech, status?

94
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,268
<i>This is God.</i>

95
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,996
<i>You are disturbing the natural
order of things...</i>

96
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,472
<i>...and will be severely punished
for all eternity.</i>

97
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,404
God has spoken.

98
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,006
How many times must
I tell you, Frank...

99
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,083
...you're not God.

100
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:40,977
I am.

101
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,316
Sorry, chief. Forgot.

102
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,256
You guys ready to roll yet?

103
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,583
Yes.

104
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,857
Like those sorry-ass M.D. S
have ever had to wait for us.

105
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,960
Tell His Highness
Mary was hot two hours ago.

106
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,962
Yeah, I'll tell him that.

107
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,530
Ready up here, chief.
- Roll and record.

108
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:00,705
Rolling.

109
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:06,007
<i>Subject, Isabelle Two.
Currently in phase-shift, 126 hours.</i>

110
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,179
Testing D-phase protocol...

111
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:16,079
...Serial Irradiated Protein Caine 125.

112
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,485
Stop naming them after yourself,
you'd have better luck.

113
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,659
Thank you, Dr. Kensington,
for that keen observation.

114
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,452
I'll include it in my memoirs.

115
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,198
I'll make sure to put you in mine.

116
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,334
Would you guys be serious, please?

117
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,467
You think she'll make it?
- I don't know, I just work here.

118
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,833
Quantum signatures are calibrated.

119
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,205
Okay, Sarah, get us a vein.

120
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,410
Spray.

121
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:54,993
Vein's prepped.

122
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,926
All right.

123
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,222
Here goes nothing.

124
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,102
Bad form, Matthew.
The honor is mine.

125
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,302
Okay.

126
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,924
Injection occurred at 0847.

127
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,568
Elevated heartbeat.

128
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,205
We're still in the green.
- Confirmed.

129
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:53,284
Bioelectric energy and quantum
shift indicators are stable.

130
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,948
We're getting cellular reaction.

131
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,132
It's working. It's actually working.

132
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,899
Of course it is.
- Don't get cocky.

133
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,248
Heart rate's up. She's scared.
It's okay.

134
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:29,977
Subject began manifesting
immediately. Protocol's acting quickly.

135
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,991
Goddamn it, blood pressure crashing.
Pulse high.

136
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,360
It's her heart.

137
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,034
<i>I got erratic heartbeat
and brain activity.</i>

138
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,003
She's going into cardiac arrest.
- Defib!

139
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,005
Prep an intracardiac.

140
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,477
Flatline. We're losing her.
- No, we're not. Hit her!

141
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,015
Clear!

142
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,725
Again.
- Clear.

143
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,291
Again!
- Clear.

144
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:14,699
Come on.
- Again!

145
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,059
Clear!

146
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,733
Fuck! Intracardiac.

147
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,964
Wait! No, we got something.

148
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,544
Still erratic...

149
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,577
...and stabilizing.

150
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,417
Oh, man.

151
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:21,399
Brain activity returning to normal.
Quantum signatures are stable.

152
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,034
Welcome back, Isabelle.

153
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,203
Yeah. Yeah!

154
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,241
Yeah, baby!

155
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,044
We did it.
- Good work, everyone.

156
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,306
Yeah! That's the way it's done, man.

157
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,812
So how's she doing, doc?

158
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,153
Well, I think she's gonna be okay.

159
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:53,594
Come on. Right in there.
- Come on, Isabelle.

160
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,300
Go ahead. Good girl.

161
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,004
Look how peaceful she is.

162
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,297
It seems like nothing happened to her.

163
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:06,806
Schedule a vivisection for Monday.
I wanna check her neuropathways.

164
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,945
You just brought her back
and you're gonna slice up her brain?

165
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,080
I'm not running a goddamn zoo!

166
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,984
You're a fucking unethical bastard.
- Tell her you're kidding.

167
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,415
Right?
- Right.

168
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,488
I won't cut her for another week.

169
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,254
Don't be such an asshole.

170
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,826
We finally have something
to celebrate.

171
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,362
Cool. I'm hungry, let's go.
- Me too.

172
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,665
We should cut you up.

173
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,940
Ladies and gentlemen,
a moment of your time, please.

174
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,143
Here it comes.

175
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,437
To the finest research team
I have ever known.

176
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:42,680
Cheers.

177
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,314
Cheers.

178
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,650
There was a big explosión,
and afterward she said:

179
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:58,295
'If you're so smart, how come
you're still in the second grade?'

180
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,294
She grew her eyebrows back?
- In a month.

181
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,660
How long were you suspended?
- A month.

182
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,381
Hey, I thought you'd gone.

183
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,383
There's nowhere to go.

184
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,856
Did I miss something?

185
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,560
Aren't you supposed to be happy?

186
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:37,426
Reversión was the last breakthrough.
Feels like the beginning of the end.

187
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,738
That's not true.
We've got a lifetime of data.

188
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,100
Matt has the patience to crunch
the numbers, but you know me...

189
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,039
...I need this grandeur
and the spectacle.

190
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,943
I can't concern myself
with the details.

191
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,451
Yeah, I know. I was one of them.

192
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,124
I thought we were great together.

193
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,051
You were great.

194
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,388
I was just standing next to you.

195
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,695
Come on. We had some good times.

196
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,937
Yeah, we had some good times.

197
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,206
Have you ever wanted to
turn the clock back?

198
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,274
Go back and try again?

199
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:30,485
L'd say that kind of time travel
doesn't exist.

200
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,615
Well, maybe we should invent it.

201
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,338
Or not.

202
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,179
What's it like?

203
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,567
Four years ago, this committee
gave me...

204
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,835
...a very specific
and challenging task...

205
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,732
...to phase-shift a human being
out of quantum sync...

206
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,906
...with the visible universe...

207
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,473
...and return him safely
with no aftereffects.

208
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,469
We found that sending them
to never-never land was easy.

209
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,512
It's the getting them back
that's hard.

210
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,058
Primary DNA strands
decaying on you?

211
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,392
Along with cellular bond instability.

212
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,565
How have you solved the problem?

213
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:27,996
I haven't.

214
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,677
But we're close.

215
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,438
We just need more time.

216
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:52,296
Ever since you walked in my class
your freshman year...

217
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,258
...I knew you were different.

218
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,535
Over the years, your genius
has been most impressive.

219
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,430
Thank you, Dr. Kramer.

220
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,195
Well, don't thank me yet.

221
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,405
This committee has given you
remarkable leeway.

222
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:10,240
We've tolerated your eccentricities,
as well as your need for privacy.

223
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:14,747
And I assure you,
our patience is running out.

224
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,318
If we don't get results
and get them soon...

225
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,553
...your genius will cease
to impress me.

226
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,957
And if you can't make it work...

227
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,594
...I'll find another
Sebastian Caine who can.

228
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,134
What just happened in there?
- This better be good.

229
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,166
I wasn't ready for them to know.
- You weren't ready?

230
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,168
Being ready's not it.
You have results, you report them.

231
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,103
Can I explain?
- You just lied to the Pentagon!

232
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,345
Once they know we've completed it...

233
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,275
...what's to stop them from
taking over the project?

234
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,177
Why would they?
- Because they won't need us.

235
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,250
But it's their project.
It's gonna happen sometime.

236
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,356
It may be their project,
but it's my dream, my visión.

237
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:57,150
What are you proposing?
- That we go to Phase Three ourselves.

238
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,020
Phase Three? Are you nuts?

239
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,630
You can't jump into human testing.
There's rules, procedures.

240
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:07,828
You don't make history with rules.
You make it by seizing the moment.

241
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,769
You wanna be the first one.
That's what this is about.

242
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:17,712
This is not about me, it's about us.
We said we would change the worid.

243
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,581
Now is our chance.

244
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,726
And we'll get the Nobel Prize.

245
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,591
Come on, buddy.

246
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:49,443
You know, if somebody finds out that
we bypassed advisory review...

247
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:54,051
...we're never gonna work again.
- But if it works, no one'll care.

248
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,522
How did you get clearance
for Phase Three?

249
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,522
I volunteered. They approved.
- No way.

250
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,296
You're kidding.

251
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,796
You volunteered? Are you insane?

252
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:18,002
Jonas Salk tested the polio vaccine
on himself. Was he insane?

253
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,177
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was.

254
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,243
Shit.

255
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:27,474
In the past four weeks, we have
brought back seven primates.

256
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,519
The results speak for themselves.
- Or do you wanna believe that?

257
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:36,386
Sarah, I thought you'd be happy.
We are giving the animals a break.

258
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:44,325
Moving this fast is bad science,
no matter who the guinea pig is.

259
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:49,006
I can't believe they approved this.
- I think it's fucking cool.

260
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,432
You would.

261
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,677
If we're to move forward,
this is the next logical step.

262
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,749
I'll stay shifted for three days and then
we'll perform a quantum reversión.

263
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:01,953
Fuck, yes.

264
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,087
Can I count on your best work?

265
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,261
Good.

266
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,900
How did we let him talk us into this?

267
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,272
Can we talk about it later?

268
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,534
I'm trying to make love to you.

269
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,444
We're risking our professional
lives here.

270
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,374
Yes, Matt, I realize.

271
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,142
Then why did we agree to it?

272
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,478
Because we're suckers.

273
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,655
And because sometimes
when you get to the edge of the map...

274
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,819
...you have to keep sailing
to see what's out there.

275
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,331
And maybe because we both know
that Sebastian can pull it off.

276
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:01,005
Let me ask another question.
- Is it about who's gonna be on top?

277
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,282
Ever miss being with him?

278
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:14,549
Why do you ask that?
- Because he sets the bar pretty high.

279
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,696
Let me tell you a little secret.

280
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:24,397
The concept of Sebastian
is much more appealing...

281
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,694
...than Sebastian himself.

282
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,607
Whereas you...

283
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,203
You're methodical...

284
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,005
...precise...

285
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,312
...and very, very thorough.

286
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,090
And besides...

287
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,528
...you fit better.

288
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,756
We're ready for you.

289
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,538
See you later.

290
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:07,941
It's not too late to stop.
- I thought I was the nervous one.

291
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,840
We have a lot riding on this.

292
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,243
Hear about Superman
and Wonder Woman?

293
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,543
Stop clowning around.
- It's a good one.

294
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,912
Superman is flying over Metropolis.

295
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,418
He's horny and checking out
the rooftops.

296
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:24,060
He sees Wonder Woman sunning
on the roof of the Justice League.

297
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:28,925
She's lying there buck-naked, spread-
eagle, wanting to be fucked, right?

298
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,667
Superman says to himself:

299
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,233
'I gotta get myself
some Wonder pussy. '

300
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:37,339
Then he realizes that he could
fly down, do a little fast pumping...

301
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,510
...and be gone before she knew,
since he's Superman.

302
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,679
Faster than a speeding bullet.

303
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:46,576
He swoops down, he fucks her
so quick, she doesn't even see him.

304
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:51,312
Wonder Woman sits up, says,
'What the fuck was that?'

305
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,281
And the Invisible Man says,
'I don't know...

306
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,528
...but my asshole is killing me. '

307
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,630
That's funny, right?
Come on, guys. That's funny.

308
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,219
Ladies, please. This is science.

309
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,987
Starting IV drip.

310
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,563
Okay, how are you feeling?
- I'm a little tense.

311
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,204
Pulse 88. BP 140l95.
It's a bit elevated.

312
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,067
I wonder why.

313
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,167
Are you sure?

314
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,143
Positive.

315
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,345
We ready up in heaven?
- Ready.

316
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,251
Mary's rolling.

317
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,579
I just hope we're not making
a snuff film. Rolling.

318
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,249
If it is, I got dibs on his Porsche.

319
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,651
Janice, how can you say that?

320
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,085
Sorry.

321
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,254
Porsche is mine.

322
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:10,231
Subject male, age 38,
weight 166 pounds.

323
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,202
Serum's irradiated.

324
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:18,942
This better work.
- It will.

325
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,610
Oh, yeah?
- You wanna bet on it?

326
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,371
If I win, you won't be around
to pay off, so, no.

327
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,683
Are you ready?

328
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,684
I'll do it. So if anything
goes wrong, you can't be blamed.

329
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,412
All right.

330
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,589
Any last words?

331
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,026
Yeah. If I die, pretend I said
something deep and clever.

332
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,063
Injection administered at 1823.

333
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,600
Are you feeling anything?
- Nothing so far.

334
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,302
Vitals are stable.
- Nothing's happening.

335
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:28,103
Human DNA structure
may take more time.

336
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,904
You pulsed it right?
- Yes.

337
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,741
Recheck the radiation.
It can't be non-reactive.

338
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,509
No change in bioelectric activity.

339
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:36,954
Goddamn it!

340
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,649
I'll repeat the protocol, okay?
- Wait.

341
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,454
I'm starting to feel something.

342
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,099
It's my arm. It's...

343
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,196
It's getting warm.

344
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Okay, it's starting to tingle.
Yeah, it's moving down into my back.

345
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,110
Here we go.

346
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,963
Shit! It hurts.

347
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,466
It's tearing me.

348
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:27,538
Heartbeat's elevated.
Pulse at 110. 130.

349
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,876
Christ, didn't think it
would hurt so much.

350
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:38,404
Frank, readouts!

351
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,709
Brain waves are spiking.
He's on the verge of a seizure.

352
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,887
Pulse is 165, 170.
Blood pressure 180 over 110.

353
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:52,688
Sebastian, can you hear me?
Sebastian?

354
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,596
His heart'll blow out!
- Standby paddles!

355
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,166
Coming in.

356
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,072
Subcellular quantum. He's shifting.

357
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,338
Bioelectric in the red.

358
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:13,675
Wait.

359
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,517
He's going.

360
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,118
Pulse is 180.

361
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,121
Holding stable.

362
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,442
Holy shit.

363
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:52,250
Pulse is dropping. 170, 160, 150.

364
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:16,010
<i>Bio-quantum phase-shift
occurred at 1826.</i>

365
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,604
Is he okay?

366
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,251
Yeah, he's in bioelectric shock.
Passed out from the trauma.

367
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,817
Vitals returning to normal?

368
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,785
Pulse 110, dropping.
Blood pressure's 130l75.

369
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:30,152
Quantum readings normal.
- Electrical activity is stabilizing.

370
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,830
Something to tell the grandkids.

371
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,268
Pulse steady at 85.

372
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,502
You did it. You're the first.

373
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

374
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,171
It's okay. It's okay.

375
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,544
You nodded off.

376
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,851
His breathing's hypnotic.
- Yeah.

377
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,651
How long has it been?

378
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,686
Seventeen hours.

379
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,859
And we already have enough data
for two lifetimes of research.

380
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,823
It's a brave new worid, Lin.

381
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I keep looking at that hole,
wondering if he's really there.
Did you see that?
- Sebastian, can you hear me?

382
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:58,579
Christ! The lights!
Turn off the goddamn lights!

383
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,785
I can't close my eyes.

384
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,546
You can, but your eyelids
are transparent.

385
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:11,228
It's weird. I feel the same,
but I'm not here.

386
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,587
You're here.

387
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,635
Sebastian?
- I'm right here.

388
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,901
Where?
- At the mirror.

389
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,374
Looking at myself.

390
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,384
Or, rather, not looking at myself.

391
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:42,549
Hey, how's he doing?

392
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,658
Why don't you ask Sebastian?

393
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,929
How do you feel?
- Oh, not too bad, considering.

394
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,302
Just wanna set the mood.

395
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:59,939
It's the light.
His eyelids are transparent.

396
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,271
So, what's it like being a ghost?

397
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:06,677
Ghosts are dead. I'm very much alive.

398
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,248
Come on, don't be a dick.

399
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,477
Sorry. I couldn't resist.

400
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:14,179
Okay, now I feel like
we're playing Marco Polo.

401
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,484
I wonder where he is now.

402
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,356
Well, I see the procedure's
not changed your personality.

403
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,367
He just brushed by me.
- No worries, I'm on it.

404
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,531
Do you see anything?
- Where is he?

405
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,207
You got him?

406
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,144
Sebastian?

407
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,813
Got you, chief.

408
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,445
You guys have no sense of fun.

409
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,677
Shit. Oh, my God.

410
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,016
L've arranged for one of us to be
here 24l7, if you need anything.

411
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:51,285
The team's gonna be on alpha-call
alert, so we can be here within...

412
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:55,521
Thirty minutes. I know.
I wrote the procedure, remember?

413
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:59,794
I was reassuring you. There's
a thermal camera for observation.

414
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,301
She likes this, doesn't she?
- What?

415
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,064
Being in charge.
- Oh, yeah. She loves it.

416
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,911
It's about time the shoe
was on the other foot.

417
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,172
Well, just remember.

418
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,542
It's still my project.

419
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:26,687
You okay taking the late shift?
- It's not like I have a social life.

420
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,764
I know. The workaholic's curse.

421
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,696
Carter's gonna be in by 6
to spell you.

422
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,064
I'm here at 8.
Call me if you need to.

423
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,164
I'll be fine. Get some sleep.

424
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,205
Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

425
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,131
Sarah?

426
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,165
Are you awake?

427
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

428
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:36,184
Sebastian?

429
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,393
Are you in here?

430
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,306
I know you're in here.

431
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,217
Then when I checked the monitor
again, he's back in the bed.

432
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:09,324
When I ask him where he'd been,
he said he's getting coffee.

433
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:13,054
Why didn't you call me?
- Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not.

434
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:18,167
I mean, I could have been dreaming.
I just thought I should tell someone.

435
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,961
What do you wanna do?

436
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,298
I don't know. I have a tough time
believing he'd be that crude.

437
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,466
I feel so stupid.

438
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,870
Why don't I talk to him?
I'll see what he says...

439
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,102
No, don't.

440
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:32,510
You know, it's probably nothing.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

441
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,214
So how was your first night?
- Restless.

442
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,719
Hard to sleep without
closing your eyes.

443
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:41,982
What'd you do?

444
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,218
Got up a couple of times.
Walked around.

445
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,657
Sarah mentioned you weren't
in your room.

446
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,399
I got a cup of coffee.

447
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:53,262
In the future, you'll wanna tell
the on-call where you're going...

448
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,596
...just in case something
happens to you.

449
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,898
I'm touched by your concern,
but it's not a problem.

450
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,077
We don't want it to become one.

451
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,179
Everything's normal.

452
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,747
All right, let's get these off.

453
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,550
You okay?

454
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:14,090
Yeah. Why?

455
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,589
You seem a little nervous.

456
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,856
No, I'm fine.

457
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,796
Are you looking at me?

458
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,031
No.

459
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,096
Why?

460
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:34,945
No reason.

461
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:48,080
What was the clientele like?
- This guy comes up to me and says:

462
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:52,056
'I like my women like my coffee. '
People still use that line?

463
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,129
Maybe he meant cold and bitter.
- Very funny.

464
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:58,094
I gotta take a leak.
Keep Carter away from my food.

465
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,168
I'll try, but I can't promise.
- All right.

466
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,203
It'd be freaky, but it'd settle down.

467
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,041
No, what would you do if you knew
you couldn't be seen?

468
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:51,811
It gives me the creeps. I can't take
a piss without wearing my thermals.

469
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,956
Like anyone wants to see that.
- How do I know?

470
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,294
Are you asking what we'd do
or what Sebastian would do?

471
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,462
The difference?

472
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,198
There's human nature,
then there's Sebastian.

473
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:04,399
He's always joking that he's God.

474
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:07,465
Imagine what he'd do if
left to his own devices.

475
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:08,864
Scary thought.

476
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,404
Thankfully, it's almost over.
- Hallelujah.

477
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,803
It's just beginning.
You think Sebastian's bad?

478
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,912
Lmagine if the military
gets their hands on this.

479
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,843
Better our military than
someone else's.

480
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,532
Sebastian, goddamn it.

481
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,366
You have no idea how much fun
this is. You should try it.

482
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,897
I'm sure I'll have my chance.

483
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,437
Hey, relax.

484
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:28,184
It's my last night, so I thought
we'd try one more experiment.

485
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,512
Sebastian.

486
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:35,425
Can you guess what this is?

487
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:36,986
What?

488
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:43,993
How did it feel?

489
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,401
A little too familiar.

490
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,946
Wanna know what it's like
to make love to an invisible man?

491
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,677
It'd just be like old times.
- What do you mean?

492
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,509
You were never there.

493
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,020
Well, I'm here now.

494
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,282
We talked about this once, remember?

495
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:09,784
What?

496
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:12,459
You wondered if you'd know
the difference.

497
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:16,294
Sebastian, I do know the difference.

498
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,531
It's not what I don't see.
It's what I don't feel.

499
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:23,939
Get some rest.

500
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:25,866
Got a big day tomorrow.

501
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,379
Subject: Dr. Sebastian Caine.

502
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:39,849
Currently in phase-shift
86 hours, 23 minutes.

503
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:44,116
D- phase protocol. Injecting
Serial Protein Caine 127.

504
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,362
Irradiation complete.

505
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:47,787
Set.

506
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,361
Are you ready?
- Not really.

507
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,068
I was starting to enjoy myself.

508
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,037
Well, tough.

509
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,636
We'll see you in a minute, my friend.

510
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,583
Injection occurred at 0928.

511
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,493
What are you feeling?

512
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,360
Something's not right.

513
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,107
Heartbeat elevated. Frank.

514
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:32,908
Shift indicators are erratic.

515
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:36,510
Bioelectric's jumping.
- Check radiation. Crash cart.

516
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:39,742
What?

517
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,573
What's happening?

518
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:44,013
I can't breathe.

519
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,052
Check his airway.
- His lungs are seized. Intubate.

520
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:52,021
Carter!

521
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,459
Tube him!

522
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:09,172
Sebastian.

523
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:20,256
He's going into phase-shift.
- Get him on the table.

524
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,125
We lost our signals.

525
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:25,086
Goddamn!

526
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,554
Get me an IV of AG-7.
- I'm on it.

527
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:34,470
No pulse.

528
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,829
L've got no pulse!

529
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,597
Starting CPR.

530
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:46,775
Don't you die on me.

531
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:50,578
Don't you fucking die on me.
- I'm getting a pulse.

532
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:57,751
Sebastian, can you hear me?
- He's going into shock.

533
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,701
Jesus.

534
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:11,968
Hi.

535
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,443
So I guess it didn't work.

536
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,940
No.

537
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,008
You look worried. Must've been bad.

538
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:23,880
You almost died.

539
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,548
Whatever doesn't kill me
makes me stronger.

540
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:31,793
Yeah, and ends our careers.
What are we gonna tell Kramer?

541
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,196
Nothing.

542
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,529
He doesn't need to know yet.

543
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:41,367
We can't keep lying to the others.
- We don't have a choice.

544
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,231
If I'm gonna be stuck
like this for a while...

545
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,634
...we'll have to make
a few adjustments.

546
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:52,806
Done.

547
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:57,553
Open.
- Here.

548
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:23,946
Okay, lift.

549
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,048
Carter, get the fan.

550
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,125
Okay, don't move.

551
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:56,612
Don't move.

552
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,113
Thanks. That's better.

553
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,316
Here you go.

554
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:12,594
It's an improvement.
- You'd almost pass for human.

555
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:16,094
He couldn't before.
- You have a face you can talk to now.

556
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,924
We can all work in normal light again.

557
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,265
Let's see if we can't try
to figure out what went wrong.

558
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,907
Before he starts biting people too.

559
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,082
Goddamn it!
- What?

560
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:35,681
I lost cohesión again.

561
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,420
Are you any closer?
- No.

562
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:41,649
You know, I can't figure out
the B and C of it.

563
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,318
The B and C?

564
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:49,162
My 5th grade teacher told me that
genius is getting from A to D...

565
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:51,765
...without having to go
through B and C.

566
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,761
Sebastian can do that.

567
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:57,531
But me, I gotta have the B and C.

568
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:03,343
Hold on, Sebastian.
We're almost there.

569
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,009
Come on, guys. Out of the way!

570
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,722
I can't take much more testing.

571
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,226
I know how hard it is.

572
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,695
Bullshit. You don't know anything.

573
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,731
This isn't easy for any of us.

574
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:31,167
Fuck you, Matt! It is easy for you.

575
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,572
I was to be in phase-shift
for three days.

576
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,039
It's been 10 fucking days, all right?!

577
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,510
Ten days of tissue tests, radiation
tests and your fucking needles!

578
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,377
I can't fucking take it anymore.

579
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,089
What I meant was...
- Fuck what you meant!

580
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:49,683
And don't ever...

581
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,190
Don't ever tell me
how hard you have it.

582
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:02,236
Come on, Sebastian,
you're tired and you need to rest.

583
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:08,301
I can't believe I gotta
spend another night in this place.

584
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:11,607
We're trying to do everything we can.

585
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:15,747
Yeah, that's not enough.

586
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,526
There she is.

587
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:03,591
L'd suck the tits right off of you.

588
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,767
Hey.

589
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,731
Dr. Caine, what's going on?

590
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,337
wonk uoy tel ot yb deppots tsuJ
.elihw a rof tuo gniog m'I

591
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,571
Wait. Going out?
Hold it a second. Dr. Caine.

592
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,408
Sebastian.

593
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:17,972
Dr. Caine.

594
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,579
What do you mean?

595
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,840
If I don't get out, I'll go nuts.

596
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,484
You can't leave the compound.
- Why not?

597
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,415
It's the rule.
- It's my rule, I just changed it.

598
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,989
<i>Authorization.
- Caine 0027.</i>

599
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,420
<i>Confirmed.
- You can't just change it.</i>

600
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:36,029
I'm not gonna spend my life
in this godforsaken dump!

601
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,927
I'm going out! Be back
in a couple of hours!

602
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,830
Oh, shit!

603
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:52,137
<i>Hello?
- It's Carter. We got a problem.</i>

604
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,328
How's it going, Ed?
- Hey, doc.

605
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:17,405
I haven't seen you in a while.
- You know how it is sometimes.

606
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:18,641
Work, work, work.

607
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:22,300
I was beginning to worry because
your car hadn't moved.

608
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:24,580
Thanks a lot, Ed.

609
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,348
But everything's cool.

610
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,023
Hey, look. Look.

611
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,557
Look at that.
- Man, he's weird.

612
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:14,628
Oh, my God.
- Mommy! Mommy!

613
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,229
Mommy! Mommy!
- What?

614
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:19,428
What?
- Look, it's a ghost.

615
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:22,968
Don't be ridiculous.
- Mom, it's a ghost.

616
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:27,770
I'll meet you at the lab.
I'll go by his place just in case.

617
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:29,202
I'll see you there.

618
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,110
He could be here.

619
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:34,639
He could be anywhere.

620
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:32,367
Shit.

621
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,444
Don't even think about it.

622
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:53,718
Who's gonna know?

623
01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:58,811
Sebastian?

624
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,183
Sebastian?

625
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:18,030
Oh, shit.

626
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,349
Matt, it's me. He was here.

627
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,856
No, he took his mask off.

628
01:02:45,127 --> 01:02:48,688
He must be outside somewhere.
I don't know where he went.

629
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,728
I'm coming back to the lab.

630
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:54,766
How? How am I supposed to do that?
I can't fucking see him.

631
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:39,780
You say you want us to shoot him?
I'm in.

632
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:43,611
It's not a monkey, it's Dr. Caine.
Aren't we overreacting here?

633
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,151
I don't give a rat's ass if we are.
Out there, he's at risk.

634
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:51,120
If someone finds out what he is,
the whole program is destroyed.

635
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,887
Jeez, relax.
Nobody's gonna find out.

636
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:57,156
Can I still shoot him?
- Where have you been?

637
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,624
I told Carter.

638
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,494
I was getting stir-crazy.
I went home to pick up stuff.

639
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:03,965
Bullshit.

640
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:05,433
I went to your apartment.

641
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,109
You did more than 'pick up stuff. '

642
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:11,939
What are you talking about?
- You, of all people. How could you?

643
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,012
What did you see in my apartment?

644
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:16,114
I saw your face, your clothes.

645
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,321
Sebastian, in public.
Why'd you have to go out in public?

646
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:23,787
I'm still project leader.
It's my decisión to make.

647
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:27,490
You're right. It's your decisión.

648
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:32,030
But if you leave again, I swear
I'll go straight to the committee.

649
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,299
Throw your career away?

650
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,462
Not likely.

651
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,197
Try me.

652
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,811
So that's it, huh?

653
01:04:50,252 --> 01:04:52,117
I'm officially a fucking lab rat.

654
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:54,653
You volunteered.
You knew the consequences.

655
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:59,152
Next time you do inventory,
get me an exercise wheel.

656
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,828
Yeah, sure.

657
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,390
Let's pack it up and go home.

658
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:08,362
Exercise wheel? Was he serious?
- What do you think?

659
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,198
Hey, Lin.
- Yeah?

660
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:13,500
The committee knows
what we've done, don't they?

661
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:18,810
Shit, Lin!
- Won't matter if we can get him back.

662
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:22,540
I can't believe you did that!
- You have deniability, you didn't know.

663
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:26,850
All I ask is please,
please don't fuck us.

664
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:35,325
Think she'll say anything?
- No, she's in too far.

665
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,327
She doesn't worry me.
- Sebastian.

666
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:42,026
He's been gone longer than the
animals. It might affect his mind.

667
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:43,863
What if it already has?

668
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,402
Hold still.

669
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:54,383
Good.

670
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:59,046
So, what was it like?
- What do you mean?

671
01:05:59,321 --> 01:06:03,553
When you were out in the worid.
- I just walked around. You know.

672
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,762
You just walked around.
Come on, there's more, right?

673
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,425
Like what?

674
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:10,956
Man, if it was me...

675
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:14,031
...I'd be fucking with people,
whispering in ears.

676
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:17,566
L'd be hanging out at Victoria's
Secret. L'd be the king.

677
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,069
Childish, don't you think?

678
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:24,603
No.

679
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:28,816
Well, it was late.
I wasn't out for very long.

680
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:30,843
Did you see anybody?

681
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,984
There was this one girl.

682
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,624
Did you mess with her?
- No.

683
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:42,358
Well, maybe I scared her a little.
- Yeah?

684
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:44,196
How'd that feel?

685
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,699
I liked it.

686
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:50,470
Nice.

687
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:11,116
<i>Hello.
- Lin.</i>

688
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,619
<i>Remember the B and C?
I think I found it.</i>

689
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:19,256
55 percent reversión.
That's the best we've gotten yet.

690
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:24,296
Protein structure was a dead end. Key
was to manipulate radiation signature.

691
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:27,627
75 percent. 80 percent.

692
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:29,903
82.
- Come on.

693
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:31,633
We've got it.

694
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:32,898
No, it's slowing.

695
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:35,076
Be an optimist.
- It's slowing down.

696
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:38,404
88. 92 percent.

697
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:41,448
93 percent.

698
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:44,486
94 percent.

699
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:47,181
95 percent.

700
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:52,323
No!
- Shit!

701
01:08:53,495 --> 01:08:58,364
Cellular bonds are collapsing.
- Full quantum cascade at 95 percent.

702
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,132
Some breakthrough.

703
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:03,805
If I were on a table right now,
I'd be a steaming pile of flesh.

704
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:05,106
Don't tempt me.

705
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:06,807
We're closer, which counts.

706
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:10,102
Closer! He just traded quantum
energy for stability!

707
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:11,608
It's ludicrous.
- Come on.

708
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:14,008
You're pissed you didn't think of it.
- Really?

709
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:19,950
95 percent? That's not even
worth my time! For Christ sake.

710
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:21,122
Asshole.

711
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,854
At least now we have some hope.

712
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:37,805
What?

713
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:41,569
You're a fucking moron.
What is your problem?

714
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:44,504
Matt is onto something and
he could use your help.

715
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:46,738
Matt. Oh, yeah.

716
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:49,417
Yeah, he's onto something, all right.

717
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:52,917
He's on my coattails.
He's been riding them for years.

718
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:56,556
Get off your fucking pedestal.
He's trying like hell to fix you.

719
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:58,693
Or kill me.

720
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,287
And you know what the sad part is?

721
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:05,567
I have this gift and
I can't even use it.

722
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,294
So now it's a gift.

723
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,129
Damn right it's a gift.

724
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:14,809
If you weren't so shortsighted, you'd
let me out of this cage to explore it.

725
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:20,244
If you weren't so shortsighted, you'd
be with us trying to save your life.

726
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:23,617
My life?

727
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,816
I have no fucking life.

728
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:27,587
I'm a prisoner.

729
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,491
No, you're not a prisoner.
- Oh, yeah?

730
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:36,029
Is that what you think when
you leave here at night?

731
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,926
Is that how you alleviate
your guilt...

732
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:44,003
...when I'm stuck in this shithole
and you're at home...

733
01:10:44,306 --> 01:10:46,297
...fucking your boyfriend?

734
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:51,876
What bothers you most?

735
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,607
That you don't have a life...

736
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:58,779
...or that I do?

737
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:38,651
Frank, I'm coming down to the lab.

738
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,527
Don't you sleep?

739
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:44,529
<i>Da Vinci never slept.
- Okay. I'm here if you need me.</i>

740
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,784
No, no, no, no.

741
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,365
Hello.

742
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:34,175
Motherfucker...

743
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:38,107
If you were any later,
I would have started without you.

744
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

745
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:53,461
Jesus!

746
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:06,966
I don't see anything.

747
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:15,877
Hello?

748
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:17,811
No.

749
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:19,520
No, he's here.

750
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:22,323
Yes, I'm sure. I'm staring at him.

751
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,186
Is something wrong?

752
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:28,185
<i>You want me to wake him?
- No, I was just checking.</i>

753
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:34,626
Who the fuck does she think she is?

754
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,566
I'm not good enough for her?
I'm not good enough?

755
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:40,171
I'll show them both how good I am.

756
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:41,739
Quiet!

757
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,905
Quiet!

758
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:48,178
You wanna fuck with me, bitch?

759
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:51,113
You know what happens when
you fuck with me?!

760
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:05,893
Don't worry.
Nobody's gonna hurt you. No one.

761
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:19,180
My, you're looking spry this morning.
- Oh, yeah.

762
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:21,679
There's nothing more stimulating
than staying up...

763
01:15:21,883 --> 01:15:24,181
...watching someone else sleep.

764
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,385
Good morning, gang.

765
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:28,817
Good morning.

766
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:32,026
Hi, Maggie. Good morning, giris.

767
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:49,706
Sebastian...

768
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:52,107
...you awake?

769
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,151
I am now.

770
01:15:57,486 --> 01:16:00,080
Notice anything unusual last night?

771
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:02,756
Nope, nothing at all. Why?

772
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,688
Franklin 3, he's dead.

773
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:08,696
So?

774
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:11,661
So I thought maybe
you heard something.

775
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:16,170
I was asleep.
- Yeah, all night?

776
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,497
Are you accusing me of something?

777
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:22,272
No, it just doesn't make sense,
does it, a dog dying just like that?

778
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:26,174
Look, I know how you feel about them,
Sarah, but animals do die.

779
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:30,040
It's simply a fact of life.

780
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:43,856
That's all night.

781
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:47,502
So he never left the room?
- Yeah, I guess.

782
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:50,695
I don't know.
Why would he kill a dog, right?

783
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:18,732
Hello?

784
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:28,571
Sebastian?

785
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:35,046
Sebastian, this is not funny.

786
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:19,021
What are you doing here?
- Where is he?

787
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:20,990
He's asleep, why?

788
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:23,488
I'll be right back.

789
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:28,962
Sebastian?

790
01:18:58,099 --> 01:19:00,659
Matt, activate alpha call.
I want everyone in here now.

791
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:15,343
Working late?
- That's what they pay us for.

792
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:34,468
It's really pretty clever.
All it does is loop the same image.

793
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:36,193
What do we do now? Go after him?

794
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,835
No. We're going to the committee.

795
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,132
Shouldn't we wait and talk to him?

796
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,639
He killed a dog with his bare hands.

797
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:46,245
You were there?
- He went out every night...

798
01:19:46,514 --> 01:19:49,677
...with absolute disregard
for his safety and ours.

799
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:52,250
What's he done?
- I don't wanna think about it.

800
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:55,387
Are we in trouble?
- You didn't mislead the committee.

801
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:57,582
We'll take responsibility.

802
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:00,555
What do we do when he comes back?
- Nothing.

803
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:02,830
The committee will bring security.

804
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:04,895
We'll brief you tomorrow morning.

805
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:12,871
<i>Authorization, please.
- McKay 1-Delta-835.</i>

806
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,877
You sure about this?
- It's the right thing to do.

807
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:28,447
Given Sebastian's history,
this behavior doesn't surprise me.

808
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:29,954
You should've said something.

809
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:33,685
I had a lot of faith in you,
thinking you'd take care of this.

810
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:36,122
I know what we did was wrong.

811
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:40,960
Wrong doesn't even begin
to describe it.

812
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,164
Let's leave it here.

813
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:50,009
I'll call General Caster and
convene the committee.

814
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:52,644
You go back to the lab.
We'll handle him.

815
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:54,371
Is there anything we can do?

816
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:57,379
You might think about
clearing out your offices.

817
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:01,947
For what it's worth,
we're both very sorry.

818
01:21:02,223 --> 01:21:04,487
A little late for apologies.

819
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,222
Howard?

820
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:11,329
What was that about?

821
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:14,297
Just a screwup at work.
- How bad?

822
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,504
Bad enough to wake a few generals.

823
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hi, boss.

824
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:22,694
Martha!

825
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:31,779
Help!

826
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:34,548
Martha!

827
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,711
Howard?
- Help! Help!

828
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:06,270
Howard!

829
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

830
01:23:30,004 --> 01:23:32,996
Why so jumpy?
- You just surprised me.

831
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,409
No 'good morning' for me today?

832
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:37,469
You don't love me anymore.

833
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:40,670
Just in a hurry.
- Well, that's okay.

834
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,476
It's gonna be a busy day.

835
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,123
When did he get back?

836
01:23:52,393 --> 01:23:55,658
Three a. m. He's been wandering
around the lab ever since.

837
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:57,198
Kramer called yet?

838
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:00,194
He's probably still meeting
with the committee.

839
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:03,865
We should have heard something.
I'm calling.

840
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:08,773
Hello, is Dr. Kramer there?

841
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:10,637
What?

842
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:15,447
Oh, my God.

843
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,820
What's wrong?
- He's dead.

844
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:23,023
What?
- He drowned in his pool last night.

845
01:24:29,063 --> 01:24:30,724
General Caster, please.

846
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:33,799
Hello. Hello?

847
01:24:36,437 --> 01:24:38,200
There's no dial tone.

848
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:44,175
There's no outside line here either.
- We'd better alert security.

849
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:51,149
<i>Authorization, please.
- McKay 1-Delta-835.</i>

850
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:54,321
<i>Authorization invalid.
Request denied.</i>

851
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:58,692
That's a first. McKay 1-Delta-835.

852
01:24:59,227 --> 01:25:01,058
<i>Authorization invalid.
Request denied.</i>

853
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:03,387
Let me try mine.

854
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:06,733
Kensington 2-Romeo-159.

855
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:09,937
<i>Authorization invalid.
Request denied.</i>

856
01:25:14,075 --> 01:25:15,599
We've got a problem.

857
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:20,372
I don't believe this.

858
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:25,416
When will they start looking for us?
- It could take a couple of days.

859
01:25:25,653 --> 01:25:28,884
Can you hack into the system?
- Already in.

860
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:34,583
Some security system.
- It's just he's extraordinary.

861
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:37,296
Someone's more extraordinary
than me.

862
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:40,429
What is it?
- The system's fine.

863
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:44,866
Our access codes have been
removed. There's only one left.

864
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:52,469
So we're trapped?
- We'll get him.

865
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:54,078
Let me have one.

866
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

867
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,826
Sebastian?

868
01:26:23,544 --> 01:26:24,977
He's not in here.

869
01:26:27,548 --> 01:26:30,915
Okay, Sebastian, fun's over.
Tell us where you are.

870
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:34,655
<i>Sorry, Linda, but I can't
let you turn me in.</i>

871
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:38,082
Sebastian, where are you?

872
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:40,456
<i>You have no idea what it's like.</i>

873
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:44,995
<i>The power of it, the freedom.
I can't let that go.</i>

874
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,096
Whatever you're planning,
the phones, the elevator...

875
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:53,599
...it's not gonna work.
They know about you.

876
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:55,035
<i>No, they don't.</i>

877
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:57,774
<i>Kramer died before
he could tell a soul.</i>

878
01:26:58,413 --> 01:26:59,846
<i>I saw to that.</i>

879
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,015
Jesus.

880
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:05,976
<i>You realize what you're saying?
- It's amazing what you can do...</i>

881
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:09,849
<i>...when you don't have to look
at yourself in the mirror anymore.</i>

882
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:12,215
<i>Sebastian.
- Goodbye, Linda.</i>

883
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:14,088
Sebastian!

884
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:16,358
Shit!

885
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:19,997
Where's Janice?

886
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:22,402
She was right behind us.

887
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:24,228
Oh, fuck.

888
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:27,372
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God!

889
01:27:33,981 --> 01:27:36,609
Janice? Janice!

890
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,453
Janice?

891
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:44,215
In there.

892
01:27:47,261 --> 01:27:49,525
Darts.
- Is it Sebastian?

893
01:27:58,072 --> 01:27:59,733
Oh, my God.

894
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:01,008
Shit!

895
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:02,742
Oh, my God.

896
01:28:05,246 --> 01:28:06,508
She was right behind us.

897
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:09,180
How could he do this?

898
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:12,050
He snapped. He fucking snapped.

899
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:13,747
It's worse.

900
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:16,722
He's thought this through.
- What?

901
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,017
He knew we were gonna turn him in.

902
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:23,191
He knew that his career would be
over and his only way out...

903
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:27,560
...is to make sure no one knows
what he is or what he's done.

904
01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:31,269
Which means he'll get rid of us.
- Goddamn you!

905
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:33,764
You could've stopped this!
- Back off.

906
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:36,067
You risked our lives!
- Shut up!

907
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:38,403
Don't tell her to shut up!
She's right!

908
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:42,047
I don't care if she's right!
I don't care whose fault this is!

909
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:44,883
I just wanna know,
what do we do now?

910
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:48,922
Frank, can you restore the codes?

911
01:28:50,024 --> 01:28:53,050
I'll try.
- We can't afford to sit here and wait.

912
01:28:53,327 --> 01:28:56,455
We are not gonna wait.
We are gonna take him down.

913
01:28:57,465 --> 01:28:58,898
Ever use this thing before?

914
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:02,260
We designed it to help find
the rats we kept dropping.

915
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:04,266
Too small for thermal scans.

916
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:07,400
Connecting.
- Powering up.

917
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:09,906
Activating motion detectors.

918
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:11,969
We've got movement.

919
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,075
Corridor six.
- There he is.

920
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:18,849
Got it.

921
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:21,485
Check.
- Check.

922
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:24,186
Matt, be careful.
- Just watch our backs.

923
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:26,086
Ready?
- Let's do it.

924
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:36,666
Take a left at the next corridor.

925
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:38,963
Could we trap him in corridor eight?

926
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:42,643
<i>If he keeps heading that way.
- I'm on five.</i>

927
01:29:52,353 --> 01:29:54,344
Anything?
- I think we can climb out.

928
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:56,850
There's a ladder in
the elevator shaft.

929
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:00,555
Shit, I lost him.

930
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:02,892
<i>I lost him.
- He stopped moving.</i>

931
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:06,400
It's me. It's me.

932
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:10,398
You have anything?
- No, nothing.

933
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:12,172
How did he get by us?

934
01:30:12,406 --> 01:30:13,703
He couldn't have.

935
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:15,671
Sebastian!

936
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:18,710
There. Behind the pipes.

937
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:22,910
Dr. Caine?

938
01:30:23,784 --> 01:30:26,218
Can you hear me?
- I'm taking him down.

939
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:28,984
Cover me.

940
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:30,591
Covered.

941
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:48,430
It's just a vent.
It's just a goddamn vent.

942
01:30:54,815 --> 01:30:56,578
Let him go! Let him fucking go!

943
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:11,428
<i>Matt, what's happening?</i>

944
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:13,930
Carter's down! He's hurt bad!

945
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:15,135
Get out of there.

946
01:31:15,736 --> 01:31:17,294
Where the fuck is Sebastian?!

947
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:19,970
Shit. He's right on top of you!

948
01:31:29,483 --> 01:31:32,782
Where's he headed?!
- He's coming this way, to the lab.

949
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,619
The doors are closing!
He's shutting me in!

950
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:38,886
<i>You have him?
- I do.</i>

951
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:41,827
He's still there.
He's on your side of the door.

952
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:44,154
Where?
- He's right in front of you.

953
01:31:44,432 --> 01:31:45,626
He's coming at you!

954
01:31:48,436 --> 01:31:51,064
I got thermals all over the place.
Five or six.

955
01:31:54,875 --> 01:31:56,001
I'm losing resolution!

956
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:03,515
He's pumping out heat.
You won't be able to see him.

957
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:07,153
The air's the same temperature
as his body.

958
01:32:07,388 --> 01:32:08,514
He's trapped.
- I'm going.

959
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:10,916
It's not safe.
- Get Carter! Meet at the lab.

960
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:12,990
We shouldn't separate!
- Get Carter.

961
01:32:13,294 --> 01:32:15,262
Marco. Polo.

962
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:19,928
Marco. Polo.

963
01:32:21,836 --> 01:32:22,803
You missed.

964
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:27,873
Now'd be a good time to pay that tab.
- Come on! You think you can take me?!

965
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:29,472
Come on!

966
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:37,509
What happened to you?

967
01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:40,616
Was it the serum that fucked you up,
or the power?

968
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:47,189
Aren't you the fucked up one?!
Dining on my leftovers...

969
01:32:47,928 --> 01:32:50,396
...no life except the one
you borrowed from me!

970
01:32:51,432 --> 01:32:53,900
Even with Linda.
- She left you, remember?

971
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:58,366
Jesus Christ, I can't imagine what
the fuck she sees in a loser like you!

972
01:32:58,673 --> 01:33:00,368
I'm not a deranged asshole!

973
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:02,973
No, but you're weak!

974
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:10,907
I thought killing you would be hard!
But I kind of like it.

975
01:33:23,964 --> 01:33:28,230
Oh, my God. Fuck! His pulse
is weak! His breathing's shallow!

976
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:30,198
He'll be okay!
- No, it's severe!

977
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,998
He's gonna be okay!
- Get down here!

978
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:35,572
Keep applying pressure
until I get back!

979
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:37,710
Where you going?
- He needs blood.

980
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:40,709
Wait for the others!
- Lf I wait, he'll die!

981
01:33:40,915 --> 01:33:43,247
Sarah! Fuck!

982
01:33:46,654 --> 01:33:48,281
Sebastian?

983
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:53,760
Sebastian?

984
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:55,527
Sarah?

985
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:59,629
God, I told them to meet us here.

986
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:14,645
Frank?

987
01:34:17,618 --> 01:34:18,949
Oh, God.

988
01:34:41,776 --> 01:34:45,143
Come on. Give me one step,
Sebastian. One fucking step.

989
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:46,747
Move!

990
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:56,951
Fuck.

991
01:34:57,625 --> 01:34:58,649
Hey.

992
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:00,349
Quite a mess.

993
01:35:07,635 --> 01:35:09,193
Fuck! You motherfuck...

994
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:11,766
Get off!

995
01:35:13,007 --> 01:35:16,966
We had so much fun the last time.
- No, please don't. Please.

996
01:35:17,645 --> 01:35:18,771
Sweet dreams.

997
01:35:28,322 --> 01:35:29,516
You know...

998
01:35:31,091 --> 01:35:33,457
...I've always admired
your feistiness.

999
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:52,538
Goddamn it, Carter!
Don't die on me now!

1000
01:35:52,746 --> 01:35:56,580
Sarah, I'm losing him! Sarah!
- Frank.

1001
01:35:57,284 --> 01:35:58,911
Where is she?
- He needed blood.

1002
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:01,586
She went alone?
- He would've died!

1003
01:36:02,289 --> 01:36:03,688
He's dead.

1004
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:05,653
Come on.

1005
01:36:15,536 --> 01:36:16,503
Wait.

1006
01:36:22,509 --> 01:36:23,999
Sarah?

1007
01:36:31,518 --> 01:36:33,679
Matt.
- Keep spraying.

1008
01:36:37,558 --> 01:36:38,923
Oh, no.

1009
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:46,425
Nothing.

1010
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:49,729
What's happening?!

1011
01:36:51,672 --> 01:36:54,436
She's dead, isn't she? Motherfucker!

1012
01:36:55,009 --> 01:36:56,271
Frank!

1013
01:37:00,047 --> 01:37:01,014
Jesus.

1014
01:37:08,589 --> 01:37:10,489
I got it. I got it.

1015
01:37:12,092 --> 01:37:13,650
Oh, God!

1016
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:27,300
Bye-bye, Linda.

1017
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:30,309
Have fun with your boyfriend.

1018
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,770
We're locked in.

1019
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:38,108
How bad?

1020
01:37:42,122 --> 01:37:45,091
You're losing blood,
but he didn't hit any organs.

1021
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:47,418
Frank?
- No.

1022
01:37:50,798 --> 01:37:53,392
I gotta find something
to close the wound.

1023
01:37:58,672 --> 01:37:59,934
Shit.

1024
01:38:03,978 --> 01:38:05,206
Talk to me.

1025
01:38:05,479 --> 01:38:08,448
Everything is spinning.

1026
01:38:34,775 --> 01:38:37,972
Are you still with me?
- I can't feel anything.

1027
01:38:39,613 --> 01:38:41,012
Can you feel this?

1028
01:38:42,216 --> 01:38:43,478
A little.

1029
01:38:43,884 --> 01:38:44,851
Come on.

1030
01:38:45,052 --> 01:38:46,485
I need you to fight this.

1031
01:38:46,787 --> 01:38:49,017
I need you to stay awake.
- I'm trying.

1032
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:52,186
Come on. Talk to me.

1033
01:38:52,693 --> 01:38:53,682
Talk to me!

1034
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:59,422
Matt. Matt! Matt!

1035
01:39:29,229 --> 01:39:30,992
Hello, face.

1036
01:40:20,547 --> 01:40:23,072
We are not gonna die in here.

1037
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:23,801
I'll be back with help. I promise.

1038
01:42:50,697 --> 01:42:54,497
<i>Authorization, please.
- Caine 0027.</i>

1039
01:42:54,768 --> 01:42:56,235
<i>Confirmed.
- Thank you.</i>

1040
01:42:56,436 --> 01:42:57,994
Sebastian!

1041
01:42:59,206 --> 01:43:02,198
I can't let you leave.
- Sorry, you don't have a choice.

1042
01:43:02,442 --> 01:43:04,273
Oh, yes, I do.

1043
01:43:20,761 --> 01:43:24,060
You think you're God?
I'll show you God!

1044
01:43:57,197 --> 01:43:58,630
Shit!

1045
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:45,444
I always knew you were a bitch!

1046
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:52,919
Bitch!

1047
01:44:56,256 --> 01:44:58,349
No wonder it didn't work out
between us!

1048
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:09,733
Stay the fuck away from her!

1049
01:45:12,906 --> 01:45:15,238
Thought I'd save you for a change.

1050
01:45:45,305 --> 01:45:47,330
Come on. I heard an explosión!

1051
01:46:03,657 --> 01:46:04,954
Don't touch it!
- What?

1052
01:46:05,258 --> 01:46:07,123
It's nitro.
- We gotta stop it.

1053
01:46:07,394 --> 01:46:08,918
No, we can't! Come on!

1054
01:46:09,162 --> 01:46:11,187
There's a ladder in the elevator.

1055
01:46:15,602 --> 01:46:17,763
Can you climb?
- Do I have a choice?

1056
01:46:36,656 --> 01:46:38,214
You go first.

1057
01:47:28,542 --> 01:47:29,702
Move!

1058
01:47:41,688 --> 01:47:42,780
Oh, shit.

1059
01:47:43,890 --> 01:47:45,118
Stick to the side!

1060
01:47:58,438 --> 01:48:00,167
Lt's coming back down!

1061
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:06,646
Down! Go down!

1062
01:48:36,643 --> 01:48:37,610
Holy shit.

1063
01:48:40,981 --> 01:48:42,846
We better go before it slips.

1064
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1065
01:49:08,975 --> 01:49:10,237
Matt!

1066
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:19,711
Get off of me! Get off of me!

1067
01:49:44,144 --> 01:49:45,441
Matt.

1068
01:50:02,729 --> 01:50:06,756
Let go of me!
- One last kiss.

1069
01:50:08,334 --> 01:50:10,097
For old times' sake.

1070
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:31,457
Go to hell.

1071
01:50:59,486 --> 01:51:00,453
Come on.

1072
01:51:17,771 --> 01:51:19,204
Oh, my God.

1073
01:51:19,472 --> 01:51:22,839
Not God. Not anymore.
