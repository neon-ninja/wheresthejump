00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:46,001
<i>Help!
Help, please!</i>

MADRID
JUNE 15TH, 1991

4
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:58,501
01:35 A.M.

5
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:59,376
<i>It's okay.</i>

6
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:01,251
<i>Please, calm down
so I can understand you.</i>

7
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,126
<i>- What happened?
- Please, you have to come!</i>

8
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:04,501
<i>He's inside! He's inside!</i>

9
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:14,167
<i>Please, calm down.
Tell me what you're seeing.</i>

10
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:22,917
Is there someone in your house?

11
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:24,792
Hello!

12
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:31,792
Detective!

13
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,292
That's the building there, 3C.

14
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,709
He's here.

15
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,334
Mom! Mom!

16
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:00,501
Detective!

17
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:04,084
<i>We're going to send someone
right away. I need your address.</i>

18
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:06,834
<i>8 Gerardo Núñez Street.</i>

19
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,167
<i>Are you still there?</i>

20
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:12,334
<i>Hello?</i>

21
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:18,251
<i>Calling all units, we have a 402
at 8 Gerardo Núñez Street.</i>

22
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:20,917
<i>Any available cars please respond.</i>

23
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:23,417
<i>I repeat, 8 Gerardo Núñez Street.</i>

24
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,042
EARLY MORNING, JUNE 15TH, 1991,

25
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,584
MADRID POLICE STATION 02-12
RECEIVED AN EMERGENCY PHONE CALL.

26
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,376
THIS STORY IS BASED
ON THE POLICE REPORT...

27
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:53,417
...FILED BY THE DETECTIVE
IN CHARGE OF THE CASE.

28
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,209
<i>It's confirmed.</i>

29
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:58,751
<i>There are four kids,
two more are upstairs.</i>

30
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,251
THREE DAYS EARLIER

31
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:36,292
THURSDAY, JUNE 12TH, 1991

32
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:50,376
Irene,
you get the bathroom first.

33
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:01,626
Lucia, let's go!

34
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:03,667
Get up.

35
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:07,251
Don't make any noise.

36
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,417
Come on, buddy, get up.

37
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,001
Let's go to school.

38
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:18,292
I want to go to school.

39
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,334
You want to go to school?

40
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,709
Great.

41
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:26,001
- You wet the bed again?!
- Yeah.

42
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:29,459
Come here.

43
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,709
Tell Irene
to clean you up in the bathroom.

44
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:44,292
Vero!

45
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,834
- What's wrong?
- Irene won't let me in.

46
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,917
- I'm taking a shower!
- Stop yelling!

47
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:58,042
He peed himself again.
Clean him up, you're older than him.

48
00:04:58,251 --> 00:04:59,084
Fine.

49
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:03,709
I heard you.
I'm older, I came out first.

50
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,792
- Did you heat the milk?
- No.

51
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,459
Quite the older sister you are.

52
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:52,542
Lucia!
Pay attention, please!

53
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,584
The teacher said to bring
pictures to look at the eclipse.

54
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:57,292
- Pictures?
- Yeah.

55
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:02,292
Your turn. Not pictures.
Negatives, to shield our eyes.

56
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,334
Gross!
The towel smells like chicken.

57
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:06,459
You smell like wet chicken.

58
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:09,209
- Stop it! Vero!
- Lucia, leave Irene alone.

59
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,459
Take one of
the towels hanging outside.

60
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:13,584
Your shoes are untied.

61
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:16,001
You could have told me
about the pictures last night.

62
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,501
- Me, me, me.
- Fine, you do it.

63
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:31,584
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

64
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:35,959
We had a birthday party
and closed at 2 AM last night.

65
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:38,042
I'm exhausted.

66
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,834
I came to get
a picture for a class project.

67
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:42,501
You rest.

68
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:44,959
I'm going to sleep some more.

69
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:46,584
I'll see you later.

70
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:01,834
<i>I heard it was night.</i>

71
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:06,542
<i>It's all magic.</i>

72
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:13,126
<i>And a spirit
invited you to dream.</i>

73
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:18,042
<i>I know that lately,</i>

74
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:22,542
<i>I've barely stopped.</i>

75
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:28,209
<i>I feel like I'm rambling...</i>

76
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:34,001
<i>Dawn breaks so early,</i>

77
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:37,792
<i>and I'm so alone,</i>

78
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:44,209
<i>and I'm not sorry for yesterday.</i>

79
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:48,667
<i>If the stars light you,</i>

80
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:53,417
<i>today they're your guide.</i>

81
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:58,126
<i>You feel so strong, you think,</i>

82
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:03,792
<i>no one can touch you...</i>

83
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:22,584
- What's up?
- I won't wet the bed tomorrow.

84
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:25,751
- What?
- I won't wet the bed tomorrow!

85
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:28,667
Good!
OK, go inside.

86
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:32,251
- How are you?
- Fine.

87
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,709
- You have fun?
- Yeah.

88
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:39,917
You know the earth
always revolves around its own axis.

89
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,334
It also revolves around the sun.

90
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,834
But the moon,
which is a satellite,

91
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,001
revolves around the earth.

92
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:51,501
When the moon goes
between the sun and the earth,

93
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:54,917
an astronomical phenomenon occurs,
and we call this a solar eclipse.

94
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:58,667
The moon's shadow
is cast on the earth's surface.

95
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:02,709
It's interesting,
because it's subjective.

96
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,834
It depends on
the subject looking at it.

97
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:08,751
What we see here today in Madrid...

98
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,251
...is not what they see
in Barcelona, or in Paris.

99
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:13,334
Next slide, please.

100
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:16,667
We can clearly see two different areas:

101
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,834
the shadow, or umbra area,

102
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:20,501
and the penumbra area.

103
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:23,709
The umbra has no light,

104
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,126
in total darkness.

105
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,042
Do YOU HAVE IT?

106
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,376
The penumbra is
the fragile shadow area.

107
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:37,417
Superstition has given
many explanations for eclipses.

108
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:38,751
Next slide, please.

109
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:42,917
Primitive cultures believed...

110
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:46,834
...that the sky
reflected what happened on earth.

111
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,251
So they believed
that during eclipses...

112
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,959
...darkness reigned over light.

113
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:56,501
In many cultures,
they thought that eclipses...

114
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:59,667
...were a good time for sacrifices.

115
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,251
Next slide, please.

116
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:03,417
Even human sacrifices.

117
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:05,709
In fact, they'll explain it
better in History class, but...

118
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:09,167
...the Maya
believed that human blood was...

119
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,501
Well, we're out of time.

120
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,917
We have to go see the eclipse,

121
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:29,709
but when we come back,
we'll talk about the different kinds.

122
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,417
Sara,
help me with the window, please.

123
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:34,834
If you don't have a picture,
take it from the box over there, OK?

124
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:36,126
OK.

125
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:39,167
And remember not to look at the sun,
only look through the negative.

126
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,751
- Wait a minute.
- No, let's go.

127
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,334
- Just a second.
- Girls, upstairs!

128
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:55,917
- Rosa, turn the projector off.
- OK.

129
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:15,709
Wait...

130
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:17,834
What's wrong?

131
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,834
We have to wait for Diana.

132
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:21,459
The one
who got held back?

133
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:24,126
Yeah, I told her what we were doing

134
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:25,584
and she wants to come.

135
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:29,042
Rosa, it was supposed
to be between the two of us.

136
00:12:29,251 --> 00:12:31,251
Well, now it's
between us, and Diana.

137
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,417
She's really nice, anyway.

138
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,917
Besides...

139
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:37,459
Remember Manolo?
With the spiked hair?

140
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:39,459
The one who died
in a motorcycle wreck!

141
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,167
- He was her boyfriend.
- Why'd you have to tell her?

142
00:12:42,334 --> 00:12:43,917
Sorry, it just slipped out.

143
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:47,167
But everybody knows
it works better with odd numbers.

144
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,001
Everyone's upstairs.
The coast is clear now.

145
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53,667
Begoña,
what is this junk?

146
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:54,834
Not with these!

147
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:00,792
Girls!

148
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:04,626
Get in place,
it's about to start.

149
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,042
Come on,
over here.

150
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:09,834
Look,
the negatives and the...

151
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:20,042
Gross!

152
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:32,834
Stay together.

153
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:34,751
It's this way!

154
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,501
Hey, wait for me!

155
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,751
Here.

156
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:08,834
This is disgusting.
Have you guys done this before?

157
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:12,751
Yeah, in my village.
You said you have too, right?

158
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:16,501
Yeah, but with
paper cut-outs, you know?

159
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:19,667
Never with an official board.

160
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:24,417
THE GREAT ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE OCCULT

161
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:28,001
They're dead, but that doesn't mean
they know everything, right?

162
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:35,792
What did you bring?

163
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,001
A picture.

164
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,209
What is that?

165
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:43,376
You need a personal item
of the person you want to contact.

166
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:45,834
A picture
isn't a personal item!

167
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:47,542
Of course it is!

168
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:50,084
It's personal if it belongs
to the person in the picture.

169
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:54,167
I didn't bring
any of Manolo's stuff.

170
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:58,501
Can you see it?
The moon is going between.

171
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:02,667
See the ring? See it?
Look, it's the solar ring.

172
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:04,292
I can't believe it!

173
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:08,251
Always look through...
Look at it with this, OK?

174
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:09,501
It's so beautiful!

175
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:14,167
<i>It says to put
your index finger on the glass.</i>

176
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,459
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

177
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,376
Because you
make contact faster.

178
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:52,792
Is anyone with us?

179
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,251
Is there
anyone here with us?

180
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,042
It wasn't me, I swear!

181
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,667
Who are you?

182
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:49,959
You want
to talk to one of us?

183
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:04,042
<i>Are you...?</i>

184
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:05,751
<i>Are you Veronica's Dad?</i>

185
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:14,292
Do you want
to talk to Veronica?

186
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:17,292
S...

187
00:17:19,084 --> 00:17:19,917
P...

188
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:22,126
Y...

189
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,459
I spy.

190
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:27,542
- What do you spy?
- With my little eye...

191
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:30,501
- What are you, a dumbass?
- You're the dumbass!

192
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,126
I know you're moving it.

193
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:44,834
Vero,
did you move it?

194
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:55,542
Who are you?

195
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,751
It burns!

196
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,459
Vero, are you OK?
What's happening?

197
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:46,584
Vero!

198
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,376
No!

199
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:52,417
Vero!

200
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:53,959
Please, Vero, let's go!

201
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:55,626
Please, Vero!

202
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:05,167
Find the flashlight!

203
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:06,792
Diana, the flashlight!

204
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,501
- Where is it?
- Over there!

205
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:10,376
- Rosa, I can't see!
- Fuck!

206
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:11,376
Here it is!

207
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I've got it,
I've got it here.
I've got it.

208
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:23,667
Fuck!

209
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,126
The board is broken.

210
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,001
Where's Veronica?

211
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:33,667
Veronica?

212
00:19:35,626 --> 00:19:36,959
Veronica!

213
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:42,084
- Diana, go get help now!
- We're gonna get in trouble.

214
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:43,459
Just go! Shut up!

215
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:44,751
Veronica.

216
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:47,501
Veronica!

217
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:49,167
What's wrong?

218
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:53,001
What are you saying?

219
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

220
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:26,209
<i>Veronica.</i>

221
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:29,792
Can you hear me?

222
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:32,751
What happened to me?

223
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:35,167
You fainted.

224
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:38,084
Follow my finger.

225
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:44,084
We tried to call your Mom,
but we couldn't get ahold of her.

226
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:47,042
She's working.

227
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,834
Have you ever
fainted like this before?

228
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,292
No.

229
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,292
Did you eat breakfast?

230
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:57,626
Yes.

231
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:01,376
Are you diabetic?

232
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,126
Veronica!

233
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:05,792
Would you listen to me?

234
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:07,834
Are you diabetic?

235
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,417
I don't know.

236
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:11,542
Blood sugar, any problems?

237
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:13,584
I don't know.

238
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:17,209
Family history with diabetes?

239
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:19,417
I don't think so.

240
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:23,834
Did you take any drugs?

241
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:27,626
- Pot, pills...?
- No, no.

242
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:29,292
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

243
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,667
Are you on your period?

244
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:44,376
- Veronica, how old are you?
- Fifteen.

245
00:21:46,334 --> 00:21:47,834
And you haven't
had your period?

246
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:04,251
It's probably low blood pressure.

247
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:06,792
You might have an iron deficiency.

248
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:12,459
If you can,
I recommend eating red meat today.

249
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:18,751
Rest here for a few minutes.

250
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:20,917
Class is almost over.

251
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:30,334
- That's so cool!
- <i>Girls!</i>

252
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:33,042
We always have to wait for you!

253
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,459
What happened to your hand?

254
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:37,251
I cut it on
some glass during recess.

255
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,001
Will you let me see?

256
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,834
- Where's Rosa?
- They left already.

257
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,626
- They didn't wait for me?
- You missed the eclipse.

258
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:46,042
- The sun was totally dark.
- <i>The sun was black.</i>

259
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:47,459
It was really cool.

260
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:49,626
Why weren't you there?

261
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:52,501
I was in the nurse's office.
Hey, don't tell Mom about this.

262
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,376
- About what?
- About my cut, OK?

263
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,751
- Zip your lips...
- Zip your lips...

264
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:00,751
...zip your lips...

265
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:04,626
...and throw away the key.

266
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:06,376
Come on, let's go.

267
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:20,584
- What's wrong, Irene?
- Sister Death is looking at you.

268
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:24,584
But she's blind,
she can't see anything.

269
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:26,584
<i>She's blind.</i>

270
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:31,042
- Wasn't she deaf?
- No, blind, not deaf.

271
00:23:44,626 --> 00:23:46,917
BEST MOM IN THE WORLD

272
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:59,042
- Hi, Mom!
- Hey there!

273
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:01,834
Can I have
money to play Martians?

274
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:03,042
Fine,
you take it.

275
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,834
But just one round,
then you go home, OK?

276
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:07,417
Mom?

277
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:10,042
- Not in front of the kids, man!
- Mom!

278
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:14,042
Give me
the desserts for the 7!

279
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:15,626
Stop for a second, please.

280
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,751
Why do you cover up
such a beautiful face?

281
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:20,459
Mom!

282
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,792
I'll give you Tupperware
with macaroni for tonight.

283
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:25,501
Mom!

284
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,751
Get Antoñito
and go home to eat.

285
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:29,584
Come on!

286
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:33,834
I'm starving,
my stomach is rumbling.

287
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:36,084
- They're farts.
- You're the one farting.

288
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:38,042
Farts, farts, farts...

289
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,751
- Irene, heat up the food.
- Why me?

290
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:43,834
- I always have to do it!
- Antoñito, go wash your hands.

291
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:45,584
Because I'm the favorite.

292
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:09,001
What's that?

293
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:13,251
Nothing.
Go set the table.

294
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:45,876
Vero!

295
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:48,084
Didn't I tell you to set the table?

296
00:26:58,334 --> 00:26:59,667
You keep an eye on it.

297
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:13,251
- This much?
- Yeah.

298
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,667
Then, in front of
the sun, there was...

299
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:22,126
- It was all black and dark.
- It was the moon!

300
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:26,167
You didn't understand
what the science teacher said.

301
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:31,667
Imagine a black ball
and then a yellow ball.

302
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:36,667
The black one covers the yellow one,
which is the sun.

303
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:38,459
-Irene, can you get some milk?
- You get it!

304
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:39,709
Rock, paper or scissors?

305
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:41,792
Rock, paper, scissors.

306
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:44,042
One, two, three. Now!

307
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:47,417
-I won!
- No, best two out of three.

308
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:51,376
Rock, paper, scissors.
One, two, three. Now!

309
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:54,917
Rock, paper, scissors.
One, two, three. Now!

310
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:56,001
Crap!

311
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:58,542
I beat you, I beat you, I beat you...

312
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:03,417
- You cheated.
- I cheated? You cheated!

313
00:28:03,626 --> 00:28:06,501
I never complain when you win.

314
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,792
There's no milk
left in the fridge, over.

315
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:11,751
It's in the pantry, over.

316
00:28:33,084 --> 00:28:34,251
Veronica?

317
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:36,834
Veronica?

318
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:38,459
Hello?

319
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:44,334
Irene, come here.
Veronica's all frozen up.

320
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:50,417
Veronica?

321
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:04,917
Veronica?

322
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,709
- Veronica!
- Good thing it says easy-open.

323
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:08,834
Veronica!

324
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:23,834
What happened?

325
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:25,667
You weren't moving.

326
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:27,334
And you puked.

327
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:29,001
Are you OK?

328
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,792
I'm fine.
Clean this up, please.

329
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:13,167
I'll get it.

330
00:30:19,126 --> 00:30:20,042
<i>Yeah, OK.</i>

331
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,126
Yeah, I'll tell her.

332
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:24,334
Bye-bye.

333
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:28,126
Who was it?

334
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:29,334
Rosa.

335
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:31,584
Why didn't you give me the phone?

336
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:33,042
She said she couldn't come,

337
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:35,042
she has to run
some errands with her mom.

338
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:38,751
She didn't ask to talk to me?

339
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:40,417
No.

340
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:57,834
<i>Hello?</i>

341
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,334
Hi, it's Veronica.
Is Rosa there?

342
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:02,376
<i>Hi, Vero.
No, she isn't here.</i>

343
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:04,167
But she just called.

344
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:07,542
<i>She just went out the door with Diana...</i>

345
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:09,834
<i>I thought
all three of you were meeting.</i>

346
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:11,751
<i>Vero.</i>

347
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:14,251
Yeah, yeah.
I'm running late.

348
00:31:15,084 --> 00:31:17,709
<i>Tell her not to forget
that she has to be home by eight.</i>

349
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,167
OK, I'll let her know.

350
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:20,876
<i>Thanks, sweetheart.
See you soon.</i>

351
00:31:39,792 --> 00:31:42,501
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy,</i>

352
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:46,834
<i>Centella, Centella.</i>

353
00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:50,834
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy...</i>

354
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:52,834
Girls, put your PJs on.

355
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:56,042
<i>Seven! You're in the bathroom!</i>

356
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:58,167
Doesn't count!
Vero told.

357
00:31:58,376 --> 00:31:59,126
Let's start over.

358
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,959
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy...</i>

359
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:05,542
Antoñito, that's enough!
You sound like a parrot!

360
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:07,751
If you don't know the jingle,
why are you singing it?

361
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:11,084
Yeah, yeah.

362
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:13,917
I see you...

363
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:17,251
<i>Oh, time to myself...</i>

364
00:32:17,751 --> 00:32:20,167
<i>Oh, time for life...</i>

365
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:23,959
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy...</i>

366
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:26,542
<i>Centella...</i>

367
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:28,542
Girls, behave.

368
00:32:37,584 --> 00:32:39,084
Scrub hard, I'll be right back.

369
00:32:43,376 --> 00:32:44,834
Girls, please.

370
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:46,042
What?

371
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:58,042
<i>Oh, time to myself, time for life...</i>

372
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,709
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy...</i>

373
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:17,209
Vero.

374
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:18,667
Vero!

375
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:21,501
Antoñito!

376
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,959
Antoñito!

377
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,042
- Vero!
- Antoñito!

378
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:27,209
Vero!

379
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:29,542
Antoñito!

380
00:33:30,126 --> 00:33:31,167
Antoñito, what's wrong?

381
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,001
It burns!

382
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:32,834
What happened?

383
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:40,751
What happened?

384
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:46,042
- What is that?
- It burns.

385
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:47,792
Did you touch the faucet?

386
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:50,959
I didn't do anything.

387
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:01,376
One, two, three, guess!

388
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,626
- A bird.
- No.

389
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:17,376
A flower.

390
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:18,376
No.

391
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:20,001
A dog.
Turn over.

392
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:31,209
One, two, three, guess!

393
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:38,542
- A balloon!
- Yes!

394
00:34:42,626 --> 00:34:44,626
I'm sorry
I put the water on so hot.

395
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,126
It wasn't you.

396
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:49,542
What?

397
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:51,417
It wasn't you.

398
00:34:52,376 --> 00:34:53,667
What did you say?

399
00:34:55,584 --> 00:34:58,251
I won't wet the bed tomorrow.

400
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

401
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:38,834
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy,</i>

402
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:41,709
<i>Centella, Centella.</i>

403
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:44,876
<i>Centella gives me a shiny floor,</i>

404
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,417
<i>Centella, Centella.</i>

405
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:50,167
<i>Oh, time to myself,</i>

406
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:51,917
<i>Time for life.</i>

407
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:54,792
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy,</i>

408
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:58,001
<i>Centella, Centella.</i>

409
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:37,251
<i>Let's go...</i>

410
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:40,876
<i>...leave this room,
go to outer space...</i>

411
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:44,792
<i>...your eyes glaze over...</i>

412
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:49,917
<i>...all the same color.</i>

413
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:56,167
<i>Let's go,
leave this room...</i>

414
00:37:56,376 --> 00:38:02,126
<i>...go to outer space,
your eyes glaze over...</i>

415
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:07,459
<i>...all the same color.</i>

416
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:12,667
<i>While nothing matters!</i>

417
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,876
<i>Nine...</i>

418
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:17,126
<i>Eight...</i>

419
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:18,334
<i>Seven...</i>

420
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:19,417
<i>Six...</i>

421
00:38:19,584 --> 00:38:20,501

<i>Two...</i>

425
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:24,751
<i>One!</i>

426
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:06,709
Vero...

427
00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:27,251
What are you doing here?

428
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,334
<i>Veronica...</i>

429
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:42,376
Veronica...

430
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:44,959
Veronica...

431
00:39:45,376 --> 00:39:46,834
Veronica...

432
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

433
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:02,626
Dad?

434
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:44,876
FRIDAY, JUNE 13TH, 1991

435
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,542
08:29 A.M.

436
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,334
Antoñito, what's wrong?

437
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:59,001
It just leaked out.

438
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:08,792
It's 8:30?

439
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:15,167
- Come on, run!
- Why's it always Veronica's fault?

440
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:24,834
- No, no, don't close!
- Please, just a second!

441
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,959
- By the skin of your teeth.
- Thank you.

442
00:41:29,126 --> 00:41:30,167
Thank you!

443
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:34,167
Becquer's "Legends" started...

444
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:39,001
...with an introduction
to transport the reader back in time.

445
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:45,459
A character would warn
the protagonist about a prohibition,

446
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:50,667
and then, this main character
would cross the allowed limit...

447
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:54,042
...and suffer
punishment for their infraction.

448
00:41:54,209 --> 00:41:57,417
Alonso and Beatriz
die because of Beatriz's imprudence...

449
00:41:57,584 --> 00:42:00,459
...when she forced Alonso
to go up of the Mount of Spirits...

450
00:42:00,626 --> 00:42:02,084
...on All Saints Day.

451
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:04,834
In "The Kiss,"
Lope de Ayala attacks...

452
00:42:05,084 --> 00:42:08,584
...his captain for profaning
the statue of Doña Elvira.

453
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:12,001
In short,
no one escapes the consequences...

454
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:17,751
...of passing the limit
that divides reality from fantasy.

455
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:20,542
Please open your copy of "Legends,"

456
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:24,751
we're going to read
"The Mount of Spirits" together.

457
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:28,667
So I'll start.

458
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:32,792
"On the night of the dead,
the pealing of the bells...

459
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:34,792
...woke me
at who knows what hour;

460
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:37,501
the monotonous
and eternal tolling...

461
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:40,084
...brought to mind this tradition..."

462
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:41,501
- Yes?
- May I go to the bathroom?

463
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:42,334
Of course.

464
00:42:43,709 --> 00:42:48,292
"Once prodded,
the imagination is a horse run wild ..."

465
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:38,167
You know when you go inside a house,
and they've just made French toast?

466
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:43,126
It's easy to tell the smell.

467
00:43:47,376 --> 00:43:49,001
That smell of cinnamon...

468
00:43:49,876 --> 00:43:51,209
Fried bread...

469
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:53,417
Warm milk.

470
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:57,667
If you close your eyes,

471
00:43:57,834 --> 00:43:59,709
it's like they're
on a dish in front of you.

472
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:03,251
You could almost take a bite.

473
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:09,584
I was
a Language and Lit teacher.

474
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:14,292
The French toast is a metaphor.

475
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:19,834
- What grade are you in?
- Ninth.

476
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:23,126
So you know
what a metaphor is, right?

477
00:44:25,626 --> 00:44:28,334
And you also know
we aren't talking about desserts.

478
00:44:31,876 --> 00:44:34,251
- Do you smoke?
- No.

479
00:44:34,376 --> 00:44:35,417
Good.

480
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,001
They call you Sister Death.

481
00:44:41,626 --> 00:44:42,376
I know.

482
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:45,501
- That doesn't bother you?
- No.

483
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:53,292
I like it.
Better than Sister Narcisa, right?

484
00:45:01,709 --> 00:45:03,167
What's in your hand?

485
00:45:04,626 --> 00:45:05,917
How do you know
I'm holding something?

486
00:45:08,376 --> 00:45:11,042
You don't
always need eyes to see.

487
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:13,751
Can I see?

488
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:31,501
What you did here
is really dangerous.

489
00:45:32,126 --> 00:45:33,751
I just wanted
to talk to my Dad.

490
00:45:33,917 --> 00:45:35,751
It's not who you want to talk to.

491
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:37,376
It's who you talk to.

492
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:39,209
If it isn't my Dad,
then who is it?

493
00:45:40,334 --> 00:45:42,501
- You have siblings, don't you?
- Three of them.

494
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:44,876
You'll have to protect them.

495
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:52,834
Protect them from what?

496
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:01,542
You all stop moving!

497
00:46:01,917 --> 00:46:03,084
Stop moving!

498
00:46:04,001 --> 00:46:05,501
You all stop moving!

499
00:46:05,834 --> 00:46:07,167
Don't move!

500
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:09,584
But I'm alone.

501
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:12,042
No.

502
00:46:13,876 --> 00:46:15,167
You aren't alone.

503
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:19,042
Someone answered your call.

504
00:46:20,876 --> 00:46:22,876
And now walks with you.

505
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:26,084
Don't move.

506
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,792
In the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ,

507
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:40,042
leave this body
that does not belong to you.

508
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:41,501
In the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ,

509
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:43,751
leave this body
that does not belong to you.

510
00:47:06,376 --> 00:47:07,834
Recess is over, girl.

511
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:17,501
Run, run, run.

512
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:20,501
Maybe you'll get away.

513
00:47:40,876 --> 00:47:42,042
Rosa!

514
00:47:52,626 --> 00:47:53,584
Hi!

515
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:56,167
Who's that?

516
00:47:56,584 --> 00:47:59,626
Felipe, my cousin's classmate
from trade school.

517
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:03,001
- What did you want?
- You're mad at me.

518
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:04,876
Vero,
why would I be mad at you?

519
00:48:05,126 --> 00:48:06,501
You didn't come over yesterday.

520
00:48:06,709 --> 00:48:09,584
I had to go with my Mom,
didn't your sister tell you?

521
00:48:10,126 --> 00:48:11,834
It's because of yesterday, isn't it?

522
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:18,376
The ouija board is stupid.
You say dumb stuff and move a glass.

523
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:19,584
You noticed something, too.

524
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:21,876
Rosa!

525
00:48:26,251 --> 00:48:29,251
- You saw it, too, didn't you?
- Saw what, Vero?

526
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:30,584
- Since yesterday, I've been seeing...
- Rosa!

527
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:32,876
We have to go quick,
the store is going to close.

528
00:48:33,334 --> 00:48:35,001
- Are you coming?
- Where?

529
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:39,417
We're throwing a party because
Rosa's parents are gone this weekend.

530
00:48:41,459 --> 00:48:43,042
Why didn't you tell me?

531
00:48:44,876 --> 00:48:46,667
Dude, she's telling you now.

532
00:48:47,459 --> 00:48:49,542
Besides,
I doubt you can come, right?

533
00:48:49,751 --> 00:48:51,792
You have to babysit
your brother and sisters.

534
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:53,792
Let's go.

535
00:48:57,459 --> 00:48:58,501
Vero!

536
00:48:59,626 --> 00:49:02,376
- Drop by if you can.
- Come on, we're late!

537
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:23,376
Lucia,
stop copying my homework!

538
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:25,584
THE GREAT ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE OCCULT

539
00:49:25,751 --> 00:49:28,667
This is boring!
It's always the same!

540
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:31,584
Antoñito, that's enough!

541
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:32,917
Go play in your room.

542
00:49:33,459 --> 00:49:37,126
Lucia, stop copying your
sister's homework, you won't learn!

543
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:40,209
-I learn when I copy, too.
- You're such a piece of work.

544
00:49:40,334 --> 00:49:43,584
You're going to do it, anyway.
Why do you care? You're so selfish!

545
00:49:43,751 --> 00:49:45,251
You're always the same!

546
00:49:45,376 --> 00:49:47,542
Then you do it one day
and I'll copy!

547
00:49:47,709 --> 00:49:51,292
We could do rock, paper, scissors
but you do it better.

548
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:53,001
It's not that I do it better...

549
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:55,001
<i>You have siblings, don't you?</i>

550
00:49:55,334 --> 00:49:56,834
<i>You'll have to protect them.</i>

551
00:50:21,459 --> 00:50:23,834
VIKING SYMBOLS OF PROTECTION

552
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:34,084
Representing Madrid,
Lucia Gomez, 19 years old...

553
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:38,292
...she is a doctor,
lawyer, lifeguard and firefighter.

554
00:50:38,459 --> 00:50:41,667
But there's a secret
nobody knows about Miss Madrid:

555
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:43,126
she's a robot!

556
00:50:43,292 --> 00:50:48,542
And the robot has super duper
smart artificial intelligence.

557
00:50:48,751 --> 00:50:52,876
Miss Madrid,
soon to be contender for Miss Spain.

558
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:53,917
What's that?

559
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:55,459
A thing we made in class.

560
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:56,876
How ugly!

561
00:50:57,251 --> 00:50:58,501
Take that, Miss Madrid!

562
00:51:00,417 --> 00:51:04,167
Will you win
the crown as Miss Spain?

563
00:51:04,334 --> 00:51:05,126
Yes or no!

564
00:51:05,292 --> 00:51:06,792
Soon in theaters near you.

565
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:11,126
Miss Madrid is 25 years old,
has 7 children...

566
00:51:13,084 --> 00:51:14,209
Who is it?

567
00:51:14,376 --> 00:51:15,334
Josefa.

568
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:22,417
- Where's your Mom?
- At the bar.

569
00:51:22,584 --> 00:51:25,376
Uh-huh.
Wanna tell me what you all are up to?

570
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:27,001
What's wrong?

571
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,876
The lamps!
Are you dancing or what?

572
00:51:30,126 --> 00:51:31,251
The lamps won't stop shaking!

573
00:51:31,376 --> 00:51:33,376
- We're not doing anything.
- Really?

574
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:35,751
It looks like my
ceiling is going to crash on me.

575
00:51:35,917 --> 00:51:37,251
Something else:

576
00:51:37,417 --> 00:51:40,626
I've got a huge black stain,
right on top of your bedroom.

577
00:51:41,709 --> 00:51:43,126
You have moisture problems?

578
00:51:43,292 --> 00:51:45,667
- I don't know, I'll tell my Mom later.
- Yeah, right!

579
00:51:45,876 --> 00:51:47,417
If you see her, that is, huh?

580
00:51:48,251 --> 00:51:51,001
You'll sleep well tonight
with all that running around.

581
00:51:51,751 --> 00:51:53,084
Fucking kids.

582
00:52:45,917 --> 00:52:46,834
Shit!

583
00:52:54,292 --> 00:52:55,376
<i>Veronica.</i>

584
00:52:57,126 --> 00:52:58,417
<i>Veronica.</i>

585
00:53:00,251 --> 00:53:01,501
What are you doing awake?

586
00:53:13,376 --> 00:53:15,792
Lucia, it isn't funny.
I can see your room from here.

587
00:53:18,376 --> 00:53:20,792
<i>Help us.
You're the one who called.</i>

588
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>Don't let it hurt us.</i>

589
00:54:37,584 --> 00:54:38,459
Irene!

590
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:46,209
Lucia!

591
00:54:48,376 --> 00:54:49,667
Lucia!

592
00:54:50,542 --> 00:54:52,001
Girls, wake up!

593
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:56,167
Lucia!

594
00:55:00,584 --> 00:55:02,251
Vero! Vero!

595
00:55:03,917 --> 00:55:05,334
What are you doing?

596
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:08,292
There was someone here
who wanted to hurt you.

597
00:55:08,459 --> 00:55:09,917
There's no one in here!

598
00:55:10,126 --> 00:55:11,876
We can't see it,
but it's here.

599
00:55:13,001 --> 00:55:14,084
Look!

600
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:16,042
The amulets got burned.

601
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:18,459
Take your mattresses, let's go.

602
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:20,417
We're sleeping
together in the living room.

603
00:55:22,876 --> 00:55:24,417
I'm getting Antoñito.

604
00:55:32,251 --> 00:55:33,542
It's Benahavis.

605
00:55:52,084 --> 00:55:52,876
Vero.

606
00:55:54,459 --> 00:55:55,834
Go to sleep.

607
00:55:57,209 --> 00:55:59,376
Why were you choking me?

608
00:56:01,126 --> 00:56:02,501
I wasn't choking you.

609
00:56:02,667 --> 00:56:03,834
I was protecting you.

610
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:06,709
From who?

611
00:56:07,126 --> 00:56:09,084
From something bad
that came inside the house.

612
00:56:09,584 --> 00:56:12,584
Who came inside the house?
Josefa?

613
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:13,459
No.

614
00:56:14,334 --> 00:56:15,876
A being from the other side.

615
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:17,376
An evil being.

616
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:20,126
A ghost?

617
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:22,751
A spirit?

618
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:25,334
Don't be scared.
I'll protect you guys.

619
00:56:26,001 --> 00:56:27,584
Because you're the oldest?

620
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:30,459
I'm glad you're my big sister.

621
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:32,251
I'm glad you're my little sister.

622
00:56:32,376 --> 00:56:34,626
I'm not little. I'm in the middle,

623
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:36,501
because Irene came out after.

624
00:56:37,709 --> 00:56:39,001
That's right.

625
00:56:39,459 --> 00:56:42,376
Go to sleep.
I'll keep watch.

626
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:51,292
<i>- Sorry, what's going on?
- It's a festival in Benahavis!</i>

627
00:57:17,459 --> 00:57:18,917
<i>Veronica...</i>

628
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

629
00:58:49,334 --> 00:58:51,334
Vero, what's wrong?

630
00:58:59,084 --> 00:59:00,376
What's going on?

631
00:59:01,626 --> 00:59:02,667
It's back.

632
00:59:23,834 --> 00:59:25,001
What's this?

633
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:26,876
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

634
00:59:27,084 --> 00:59:29,042
Can you tell me
what's going on here?

635
00:59:29,209 --> 00:59:32,459
- A bad man wanted to kill Lucia.
- Lucia, are you OK?

636
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:34,042
Someone came in the house?

637
00:59:34,209 --> 00:59:36,292
No, they didn't come inside.
They were already here.

638
00:59:37,209 --> 00:59:39,542
- Vero!
- Nothing happened, Mom.

639
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:42,417
But was someone
in the house or not?

640
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:44,042
- No.
- Yes.

641
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:47,501
- I'm calling the police.
- A spirit.

642
00:59:48,709 --> 00:59:50,751
- What?
- Yeah, a ghost.

643
00:59:51,292 --> 00:59:53,834
I didn't see it, but Vero did.

644
01:00:00,626 --> 01:00:03,501
- Were you watching scary movies again?
- Kind of.

645
01:00:04,209 --> 01:00:07,917
Don't worry, Mom.
Vero protects us from the spirit.

646
01:00:08,709 --> 01:00:10,501
Come on, let's pick
all this up and go to bed.

647
01:00:10,667 --> 01:00:11,709
And you go to your room!

648
01:00:11,917 --> 01:00:14,251
- But, Mom...
- No buts! Go to your room.

649
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,751
What happened?

650
01:00:27,251 --> 01:00:29,042
- Tell me!
- Nothing.

651
01:00:32,209 --> 01:00:35,542
Your sisters are little
and they've got a huge imagination.

652
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:39,334
Don't give them weird ideas
because then they can't sleep.

653
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:41,501
How do you know
if they can or can't sleep?

654
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:43,792
You're never home!
You don't know what goes on here.

655
01:00:44,542 --> 01:00:46,001
So what goes on here?

656
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:48,417
- He wants to hurt us!
- Who?!

657
01:00:48,584 --> 01:00:51,251
I don't know! I'm the one
who called him with the ouija board.

658
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:53,084
You played
the ouija board with your sisters?

659
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:55,209
- No, with Rosa!
- But...

660
01:00:55,834 --> 01:00:58,084
Why are you playing
with such dark things?

661
01:00:58,251 --> 01:00:59,542
I wanted to talk to Dad.

662
01:01:01,126 --> 01:01:02,417
I know you don't care.

663
01:01:02,584 --> 01:01:04,834
You stuffed his pictures in a box
so you don't have to look at him.

664
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:05,917
Don't say that!

665
01:01:06,459 --> 01:01:08,459
- I just wanted to talk to him!
- That's enough!

666
01:01:09,126 --> 01:01:12,126
You're reading too much of that stuff,
and it's having an effect on you.

667
01:01:12,626 --> 01:01:14,001
It's the truth.

668
01:01:14,917 --> 01:01:15,751
Vero...

669
01:01:17,251 --> 01:01:18,917
I need you to grow up.

670
01:01:19,126 --> 01:01:21,042
I need
to be able to count on you.

671
01:01:21,251 --> 01:01:22,459
Because I'm on my own.

672
01:01:22,709 --> 01:01:24,001
I'm the one on my own.

673
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:33,834
You're not making it easy.
I'm really tired.

674
01:01:35,417 --> 01:01:37,417
We'll talk more tomorrow.

675
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:17,042
<i>Nine, eight, seven,</i>

676
01:02:17,209 --> 01:02:20,584
<i>six, five, four,</i>

677
01:02:20,751 --> 01:02:24,334
<i>three, two, one!</i>

678
01:02:40,126 --> 01:02:43,292
- Vero!
- Vero, get up!

679
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:44,959
- Wake up!
- Come on!

680
01:02:45,126 --> 01:02:47,209
- Come on!
- Get up!

681
01:02:47,376 --> 01:02:48,584
Let's go!

682
01:02:48,792 --> 01:02:50,334
Leave me alone, let me sleep!

683
01:02:50,501 --> 01:02:52,834
- We're hungry!
- Come on!

684
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:54,459
We've got lots to do!

685
01:02:54,626 --> 01:02:57,209
We're hungry!

686
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:59,126
- What are you doing?
- We're hungry!

687
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:00,292
Get out, leave me alone!

688
01:03:00,459 --> 01:03:01,834
- Come on!
- Get up!

689
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:04,792
Let's play a game.
Give me your arm.

690
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:06,459
What are you talking about?

691
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:08,209
What are you doing?

692
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:16,792
Stop it!

693
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:20,501
Stop!

694
01:03:20,751 --> 01:03:21,626
Don't!

695
01:03:22,001 --> 01:03:26,334
Mom! Mom!
Help me, Mom!

696
01:03:26,501 --> 01:03:28,584
Mom, help me!

697
01:03:28,792 --> 01:03:31,334
Mom, Mom!

698
01:03:31,501 --> 01:03:32,459
Mom, Mom...

699
01:03:32,626 --> 01:03:34,459
Mom!

700
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:39,751
Leave me alone!
Mom!

701
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:44,501
Mom!

702
01:03:45,251 --> 01:03:47,209
Mom, help me!

703
01:03:48,542 --> 01:03:49,417
Mom...

704
01:03:49,834 --> 01:03:51,084
Help me, Mom.

705
01:03:51,251 --> 01:03:52,501
- I can't hear you.
- Mom!

706
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:56,209
I need you to grow up.

707
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:57,667
Mom...

708
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:01,001
Mom!

709
01:04:02,126 --> 01:04:03,167
Mom...!

710
01:04:04,751 --> 01:04:06,126
Mom!

711
01:04:07,501 --> 01:04:09,251
Mom!

712
01:04:19,501 --> 01:04:24,042
SATURDAY, JUNE 14TH, 1991

713
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:27,292
10:40 A.M.

714
01:06:04,834 --> 01:06:08,042
- Did you make breakfast?
- Wait for the show to finish.

715
01:06:08,209 --> 01:06:10,042
Always the same,
I'm sick of you guys!

716
01:06:10,209 --> 01:06:11,667
Wait.

717
01:06:14,292 --> 01:06:16,251
Why's this book here?
You don't know how to read!

718
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:18,626
Dad came to read it to me.

719
01:06:21,251 --> 01:06:22,084
Come again?

720
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:24,501
Dad came to read it to me.

721
01:06:25,501 --> 01:06:28,209
- Dad came?
- He's coming back again tonight.

722
01:06:31,709 --> 01:06:32,917
What else did he say?

723
01:06:33,709 --> 01:06:36,209
That he's going
to take me to where he lives.

724
01:06:41,792 --> 01:06:44,626
Antoñito, listen to me.

725
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,251
Listen.

726
01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:49,001
If he comes back,
don't listen to him, OK?

727
01:06:49,167 --> 01:06:50,584
Plug your ears.

728
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:52,417
How do you
plug your ears?

729
01:06:53,459 --> 01:06:54,959
Great, like that.

730
01:06:55,542 --> 01:06:57,376
And you call me, OK?

731
01:06:57,542 --> 01:06:59,584
Yell my name really loud.

732
01:06:59,792 --> 01:07:00,542
OK?

733
01:07:44,209 --> 01:07:46,292
Kids, let's go!

734
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:05,834
- Hi, Mom!
- Hey there!

735
01:08:06,084 --> 01:08:08,376
- What are you doing here?
- I need to go to Rosa's house.

736
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,251
- Right now?
- For homework. Can they stay here?

737
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:14,251
- Yeah. But come back soon!
- OK!

738
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:28,167
They're right.
You're a crazy old woman.

739
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:32,501
- Then why are you back?
- You can see the shadows, like me!

740
01:08:33,126 --> 01:08:35,792
Maybe we're both crazy.

741
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:40,709
I've been trying
to stop seeing them for a long time.

742
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:45,167
I did this
to myself, you know?

743
01:08:48,251 --> 01:08:51,501
Back then I didn't know
you don't need eyes to see.

744
01:08:52,001 --> 01:08:53,709
I don't know how
to protect myself from them.

745
01:08:53,834 --> 01:08:56,292
Amulets and crosses
don't work, they don't scare them!

746
01:08:56,459 --> 01:08:59,459
Crosses?
God has got nothing to do with it.

747
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:01,126
Leave Him out of it.

748
01:09:01,334 --> 01:09:02,834
How can I make them go away?

749
01:09:04,001 --> 01:09:06,792
The same way they came in.

750
01:09:06,959 --> 01:09:10,126
They have to go back
through the door you opened.

751
01:09:10,376 --> 01:09:12,001
Bid them farewell.

752
01:09:13,376 --> 01:09:15,584
Then you'll have to destroy it.

753
01:09:16,126 --> 01:09:18,417
- Destroy the ouija board?
- No, the door!

754
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:22,417
You have to do right
what you did wrong.

755
01:09:29,709 --> 01:09:30,917
What's wrong?

756
01:09:36,792 --> 01:09:38,376
Sister, again?

757
01:09:39,834 --> 01:09:42,126
I don't know how you can
get all the way down here.

758
01:09:43,001 --> 01:09:44,459
What are you
doing here on a Saturday?

759
01:09:45,751 --> 01:09:47,459
Sister was
helping me with a project.

760
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:49,251
She's in no condition
to help anyone.

761
01:09:49,417 --> 01:09:50,334
This way, Sister.

762
01:09:56,084 --> 01:09:58,626
The answer is in the books.

763
01:09:58,834 --> 01:10:00,751
Look what great advice she gives.

764
01:10:02,126 --> 01:10:04,417
You have to do right
what you did wrong.

765
01:10:04,959 --> 01:10:06,126
Careful, Sister.

766
01:10:06,792 --> 01:10:08,834
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

767
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,834
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

768
01:10:20,042 --> 01:10:21,626
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

769
01:10:28,209 --> 01:10:30,667
"You should never
end a séance without..."

770
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:33,626
"You should never
end a séance without..."

771
01:10:35,542 --> 01:10:36,626
Without what?

772
01:10:43,376 --> 01:10:44,959
<i>"You have to do right
what you did wrong."</i>

773
01:10:45,626 --> 01:10:47,417
<i>"You have to do right
what you did wrong."</i>

774
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:49,709
<i>"You have to do right
what you did wrong."</i>

775
01:10:50,459 --> 01:10:51,792
<i>"You have to do right...“</i>

776
01:10:55,792 --> 01:10:57,501
<i>"You have to do right
what you did wrong."</i>

777
01:10:57,667 --> 01:10:59,292
<i>"You have to do right
what you did wrong."</i>

778
01:11:25,792 --> 01:11:28,834
"You should never
end a séance without saying goodbye.

779
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:31,459
Whatever you don't say
goodbye to, stays with you.

780
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:34,626
If it doesn't work,
try again another time."

781
01:11:40,126 --> 01:11:42,376
"Whatever you don't say
goodbye to, stays with you."

782
01:11:52,709 --> 01:11:55,084
<i>You have to do right
what you did wrong.</i>

783
01:11:55,251 --> 01:11:56,584
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

784
01:11:56,751 --> 01:11:57,834
<i>The answer is in the books.</i>

785
01:11:58,042 --> 01:11:59,376
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

786
01:11:59,584 --> 01:12:01,376
"Whatever you don't say
goodbye to, stays with you."

787
01:12:01,584 --> 01:12:03,501
<i>You have to do right
what you did wrong.</i>

788
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:05,334
"Whatever you don't say
goodbye to, stays with you."

789
01:12:05,542 --> 01:12:06,834
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

790
01:12:07,001 --> 01:12:07,917
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

791
01:12:08,084 --> 01:12:10,459
"You should never
end a séance without saying goodbye."

792
01:12:10,667 --> 01:12:12,667
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

793
01:12:24,209 --> 01:12:25,042
Hi.

794
01:12:27,251 --> 01:12:28,834
You made it.

795
01:12:29,042 --> 01:12:30,751
Rosa,
I know what we have to do.

796
01:12:31,959 --> 01:12:34,167
- Why'd you bring that?
- We have to do it again!

797
01:12:34,376 --> 01:12:35,834
- What?
- We didn't say goodbye!

798
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:38,167
Whatever you don't say
goodbye to, stays with you.

799
01:12:38,334 --> 01:12:39,709
- What?
- It says so right here.

800
01:12:39,917 --> 01:12:41,709
- Cut the bullshit.
- We have to do it again!

801
01:12:41,917 --> 01:12:43,126
- Put it away!
- Let's go to your room.

802
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:44,167
Where's Diana?

803
01:12:44,334 --> 01:12:45,751
- Calm down!
- Where's Diana?

804
01:12:45,917 --> 01:12:47,542
- Put it away!
- Diana!

805
01:12:47,751 --> 01:12:49,667
- Let's go to your room. Diana!
- Veronica!

806
01:12:49,834 --> 01:12:50,417
Diana!

807
01:12:50,626 --> 01:12:53,792
Where's Diana,
have you seen her?

808
01:12:54,459 --> 01:12:56,334
- Veronica!
- Diana!

809
01:12:58,459 --> 01:12:59,542
Have you seen Diana?

810
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:02,209
Have you seen Diana?

811
01:13:02,376 --> 01:13:03,501
What are you talking about?

812
01:13:04,501 --> 01:13:05,917
Diana!
Have you seen Diana?

813
01:13:06,334 --> 01:13:08,042
- No.
- Who is Diana?

814
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:09,251
Diana!

815
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:12,167
- Diana!
- No, what's your problem?

816
01:13:13,501 --> 01:13:14,334
Diana!

817
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,417
- You haven't seen her?
- Veronica, please.

818
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:21,084
Diana!

819
01:13:22,792 --> 01:13:23,626
Diana!

820
01:13:24,001 --> 01:13:24,792
Diana.

821
01:13:26,376 --> 01:13:27,501
Diana, come here.

822
01:13:27,751 --> 01:13:30,334
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Come on, we have to do it.

823
01:13:30,501 --> 01:13:32,709
- Do what?
- The three of us together.

824
01:13:32,834 --> 01:13:34,792
- Let me go, you're crazy!
- Come on, Diana!

825
01:13:34,959 --> 01:13:36,834
- Leave me alone!
- Let go of me!

826
01:13:37,001 --> 01:13:40,792
- Kicking you the hell out!
- Come on, Diana, Rosa!

827
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:43,626
Rosa! Rosa!

828
01:13:49,917 --> 01:13:51,667
Rosa,
we have to do it again.

829
01:13:52,126 --> 01:13:56,376
- You don't remember, do you?
- Remember what?

830
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:01,376
You whispered
something to me the other day.

831
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:02,709
What did I say?

832
01:14:02,834 --> 01:14:04,292
Tell me, Rosa!

833
01:14:05,834 --> 01:14:07,334
You said
you were going to die today.

834
01:14:08,667 --> 01:14:11,292
- What?
- Vero, I'm sorry.

835
01:14:11,459 --> 01:14:14,042
- What did you say?
- We were scared, we didn't...

836
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:16,001
What's that?

837
01:14:18,376 --> 01:14:20,209
Did you bite yourself?

838
01:14:20,542 --> 01:14:22,501
No, Rosa. I didn't.

839
01:14:26,334 --> 01:14:28,251
Come on, let's go.

840
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:33,501
Rosa!

841
01:14:35,042 --> 01:14:36,209
Rosa!

842
01:14:37,334 --> 01:14:38,459
Rosa!

843
01:15:41,042 --> 01:15:41,834
Mom!

844
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:44,292
Hey, you're in the way!

845
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:48,126
Can we go home now?

846
01:15:48,292 --> 01:15:49,126
Wait.

847
01:15:49,292 --> 01:15:50,042
Mom!

848
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:52,834
Where were you all day?

849
01:15:53,042 --> 01:15:55,709
Take the kids,
they can't stay here forever!

850
01:15:57,126 --> 01:15:59,709
Give me the leftovers for the kids.
Coming!

851
01:16:00,001 --> 01:16:01,667
This is always dirty.

852
01:16:02,084 --> 01:16:03,709
Because you always get it dirty.

853
01:16:03,834 --> 01:16:05,001
Mom!

854
01:16:06,584 --> 01:16:07,542
Mom!

855
01:16:07,709 --> 01:16:08,584
What?

856
01:16:08,792 --> 01:16:10,001
Mom, close the bar.

857
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:12,042
Right now,
let's all go somewhere.

858
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:14,501
What are you talking about?

859
01:16:14,667 --> 01:16:16,417
Mom, it doesn't
come when you're home.

860
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,376
Here we go again...

861
01:16:21,834 --> 01:16:26,459
I'd love to close
and eat with you, but I can't.

862
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:28,459
- Ana!
- Coming.

863
01:16:31,834 --> 01:16:33,167
Look...

864
01:16:34,292 --> 01:16:36,001
Want to go
to the park tomorrow?

865
01:16:36,167 --> 01:16:37,834
To spend the day, like before.

866
01:16:38,334 --> 01:16:40,709
What do you think?
I'll make sandwiches to eat there.

867
01:16:40,917 --> 01:16:41,751
You want to?

868
01:16:42,042 --> 01:16:44,126
Ana, the leftovers!

869
01:16:45,626 --> 01:16:46,667
You grab them.

870
01:16:49,376 --> 01:16:50,709
Kids, let's go.

871
01:16:50,834 --> 01:16:52,251
Finally!

872
01:16:52,834 --> 01:16:54,709
- Let's go.
- Are we going home?

873
01:16:54,834 --> 01:16:56,292
Let's go, sweetheart.

874
01:16:58,167 --> 01:16:59,459
Veronica!

875
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:02,417
Veronica!

876
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:07,251
Goal!

877
01:17:08,042 --> 01:17:11,501
<i>Pedro Riesco scored.
After Ribera's mistake,</i>

878
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:13,084
<i>the first goal
in the game for the team...</i>

879
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:18,667
<i>You have to do right
what you did wrong.</i>

880
01:18:15,751 --> 01:18:17,459
- We're going to play a game.
- What game?

881
01:18:19,584 --> 01:18:22,626
We're going to play a game
where you have to do what I say.

882
01:18:22,792 --> 01:18:24,834
This game sucks.

883
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:27,792
Grab the candles
in the top drawer.

884
01:18:29,834 --> 01:18:33,626
Antoñito,
draw this on the hallway walls.

885
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:34,917
- OK!
- Great.

886
01:18:36,292 --> 01:18:38,251

01:22:09,834 --> 01:22:10,834
I don't know.

914
01:22:11,042 --> 01:22:13,167
But it says
a soft song works, too.

915
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,292
Which one?

916
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:16,001

01:34:37,459 --> 01:34:39,042
Did you bite yourself?

1018
01:34:39,209 --> 01:34:40,834
It wasn't you.
