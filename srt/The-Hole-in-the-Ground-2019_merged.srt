2
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,758
We're not getting a bike,
love, not at the moment.

3
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,760
- But, Mum...
- But nothing.

4
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:15,531
- Please.
- I said not at the moment.

5
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:21,704
Maybe next year, okay?

6
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:27,940
Sweetie, I said
maybe next year.

7
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:30,610
Stewart Macken says our
Jeep looks like something

8
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:32,311
a fedophile would drive.

9
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,213
Who's Stewart Macken?

10
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:35,515
In my class.

11
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:37,750
- Is he your friend?
- He's an ass face.

12
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:38,820
Hey.

13
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:41,888
Can I say
"anus face"?

14
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,491
- No.
- But it's a science word.

15
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,025
Mum, look out!

16
00:04:55,034 --> 00:04:56,334
Are you all right?

17
00:04:56,336 --> 00:04:57,937
- Chris, are you all right?
- Yes.

18
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:01,909
Don't move.

19
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:11,717
Are you okay?

20
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:34,804
I didn't see you,
you came out of nowhere.

21
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:29,357
I'm Chuck, the strongest
soldier in the whole land.

22
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:31,492
And you're nothing,
buddy...

23
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:33,663
No,
please, leave me alone.

24
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:37,967
You finished?

25
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:41,004
Chris.

26
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:44,070
It's gone cold.

27
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:47,073
- Put some more cheese on it.
- I don't like that dust cheese.

28
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:49,978
Then don't put more cheese on
it, just finish it, please.

29
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:07,963
Three.

30
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,600
Two.

31
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,168
One!

32
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,979
Mum wins, you know
the rules.

33
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:28,015
Oh.

34
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:12,925
Mum!

35
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:14,927
What is it, sweetie?

36
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,673
Chris?

37
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,709
There's another one.

38
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:37,445
You're getting far too
big to be scared of them.

39
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:39,414
What if it comes
back inside?

40
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,849
She won't.

41
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:42,219
How do you know
it's a girl?

42
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:44,755
Eight legs
and no willy, see?

43
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:49,057
Why don't we just
kill it?

44
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,759
What's she ever
do to you?

45
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:53,895
She croached into
my personal space.

46
00:08:53,897 --> 00:08:56,867
It's "encroached." And I don't
think she did it on purpose.

47
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:00,736
Dad would
kill it for me.

48
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:06,175
I'm not Dad.

49
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:09,412
Why did we move here
without him?

50
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:12,882
It's not that simple, sweetie.

51
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:14,850
Why?

52
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:16,482
It's just not, okay?

53
00:09:16,484 --> 00:09:19,552
Why? You said he'd
be right behind us.

54
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:20,755
You're a liar.

55
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,566
- Liar!
- Chris.

56
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:35,369
- Liar!
- Sweetie...

57
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:50,151
Chris. Wait.

58
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,490
Christopher!

59
00:10:04,998 --> 00:10:06,033
Chris?

60
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,969
Christopher!

61
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,462
Chris?

62
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,898
Mum?

63
00:11:22,038 --> 00:11:24,073
Never run off on me
like that again, okay?

64
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:27,443
I'm sorry.

65
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:31,014
Me too.

66
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:34,918
I know that
Dad makes you sad.

67
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:42,556
Love you.

68
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:43,959
I love you, too.

69
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:48,197
Mum?

70
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:52,333
What is that?

71
00:11:55,103 --> 00:11:56,104
Nothing.

72
00:11:57,873 --> 00:11:59,440
Come on, let's go home.

73
00:14:17,672 --> 00:14:18,740
Hooray!

74
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,044
Are you gonna
show me that?

75
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:34,089
You should sign up.

76
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:37,223
Might be a good way
of making new friends.

77
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:39,227
Don't wanna make
new friends.

78
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:44,696
You know, when I was your
age, I moved town once, too.

79
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:46,999
I was really scared
about going to this new place

80
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:48,533
where I've never
been before.

81
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:50,969
But, when I got there, my mum
signed me up for the Brownies,

82
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:54,906
and before I knew it, I had
a whole group of new friends.

83
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:57,277
So maybe that might happen to
you if you sign up for this.

84
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,214
Maybe.

85
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,085
You'll settle in,
sweetie.

86
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,918
We're gonna be
happy living here.

87
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
I promise.

88
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:11,655
<i>Well, no, he had one
of those faces, you know,</i>

89
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:15,494
you just want to punch over and over again.

90
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:17,462
You know, like this?

91
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:20,731
You've never punched
anyone in your entire life.

92
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,665
I punched Tom Drum.

93
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:26,037
Why, that poor kid who always had
the mustachioed dried snot under his nose?

94
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,670
That's the one, yeah.

95
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:30,573
Yeah, I punched him square
in the forehead, remember?

96
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:31,576
Why?

97
00:15:32,711 --> 00:15:34,878
It was years
ago, look, it doesn't matter.

98
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,946
But the thing is,
he gets out of his car.

99
00:15:36,948 --> 00:15:40,050
And he's walking towards me and he's
screaming at me that I cut him off,

100
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:43,585
- and he's raging...
- You want a bloody degree to open this thing here.

101
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:46,156
- - That's
you folks, though, isn't it?

102
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:48,224
Ha! And when do you
planning on graduating?

103
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:50,260
Jay's a permanent student.

104
00:15:50,262 --> 00:15:53,229
- I'm a lecturer.
- Assistant lecturer.

105
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:55,864
I am shaping
impressionable minds.

106
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:57,333
Sarah studied
teaching, too.

107
00:15:57,335 --> 00:16:00,470
Oh, well, I only did
a year, I, uh,

108
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:01,637
had to drop out.

109
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,541
I got pregnant with Chris
and I took a different path.

110
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,408
Well, I'm glad your path
took you down here,

111
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,576
best employee
I ever had.

112
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:10,379
How is that junk shop
of yours anyway?

113
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:11,947
Rob, tell your
brother he's an asshole.

114
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:13,714
Ow. You're an asshole.

115
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:16,017
So what happened to the
guy who hit your car then?

116
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,087
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So anyway,
he comes over to the car, right?

117
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:20,489
And he puts his
hand on the bonnet.

118
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:22,391
Right, and I swear he's
not gonna budge an inch,

119
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:24,493
and he's glaring right
at me and you can see...

120
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:25,960
Sounds like
Walkie-Talkie.

121
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:27,528
Mmm-hmm.
- Who's that?

122
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,832
Walkie-Talkie, it's
this crazy old lady

123
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:32,133
lives up on the hills
near here.

124
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:33,401
Near the bridge
by your house.

125
00:16:33,403 --> 00:16:34,768
You must have
seen her by now.

126
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,837
Oh, yeah, that's the one
you told me murdered a kid.

127
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,638
She didn't murder him.

128
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,410
- No?
- No.

129
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:43,110
Tell the story.

130
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:44,177
There's no story.

131
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:46,549
No, go on.

132
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:53,520
Her son James was in my class,
used to sit across from me in school.

133
00:16:53,522 --> 00:16:56,990
He was really nice, friendly,
really into nature, I remember.

134
00:16:56,992 --> 00:17:00,860
He used to have, um, ants in
a pencil case under his desk.

135
00:17:00,862 --> 00:17:03,963
Anyway, when we were
around eighth, Noreen,

136
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:05,164
Noreen Brady
is her name,

137
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,467
she came bursting
into the classroom.

138
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:10,836
Out of control, screaming
insane things about him.

139
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:14,540
It took three teachers to drag
her into the principal's office

140
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,509
and lock her in
before the police came.

141
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:18,177
Nobody knew
what was wrong with her.

142
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,745
He was taken out
of school for a while and

143
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:23,449
she went away to have
her head fixed.

144
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:24,983
And then,
a few months later...

145
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:26,185
She got out,

146
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:28,019
got a car and mowed
the kid down.

147
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:31,423
No. No, that's not what
happened, it was an accident.

148
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,158
It was an awful
tragedy.

149
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,495
That poor woman.

150
00:18:45,663 --> 00:18:46,664
Chris?

151
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:07,984
Sweetie?

152
00:19:09,218 --> 00:19:10,886
What are you
doing down here?

153
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

154
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:22,546
Christopher?

155
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:50,003
<i>Emergency.</i>

156
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:51,071
Is this the police?

157
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:53,173
<i>No, but I can
connect you to the police.</i>

158
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:54,441
<i>What's the emergency?</i>

159
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:55,876
It's my son,
he's missing.

160
00:21:55,878 --> 00:21:57,477
<i>What's your address,
please?</i>

161
00:21:57,479 --> 00:22:00,347
Uh... I don't, um...

162
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:02,349
There's no number
on the house.

163
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:04,150
<i>Tell me what
town you're in.</i>

164
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:06,085
No, someone might've
taken him.

165
00:22:06,087 --> 00:22:08,755
<i>You're gonna have to stay calm
and tell me where you live</i>

166
00:22:08,757 --> 00:22:10,425
<i>if you want me
to help you.</i>

167
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,258
<i>Okay?</i>

168
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,432
<i>Hello?</i>

169
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:21,400
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mummy?

170
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:22,603
Hel...

171
00:22:24,605 --> 00:22:25,873
Where were you?

172
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:27,875
Chris.

173
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:30,609
Where were you?

174
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:32,780
- Here.
- No, you weren't.

175
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:36,716
Are you okay,
Mummy?

176
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:45,657
How long you been
in the area?

177
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,090
Um, just a few
weeks.

178
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:50,528
And has it only been since the
move that you felt like this?

179
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,665
Any history of anxiety
disorders in your family?

180
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:54,566
No.

181
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:55,934
Have you ever been
on medication before?

182
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:58,604
- No.
- And how about that scar?

183
00:23:00,573 --> 00:23:01,974
May I see it, please?

184
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,216
That's quite the bump.

185
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:15,452
Yeah, I was in
an accident.

186
00:23:15,454 --> 00:23:16,920
Not so long ago
by the look of it.

187
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:19,658
About a year ago, but it just
sometimes gets irritated.

188
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:22,793
This is
three weeks' worth.

189
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:25,261
It's not too heavy but
best to take before bed.

190
00:23:25,263 --> 00:23:29,200
Check back in with me then and
we'll see how you're doing, okay?

191
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:42,881
Sweetie, dinner's ready.

192
00:23:44,515 --> 00:23:45,982
<i>You shall have
diamonds.</i>

193
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:50,886
<i>Sparkling eyes
of yours.</i>

194
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:54,090
<i>White diamonds.</i>

195
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:03,063
- Chris.
- Mummy?

196
00:24:04,968 --> 00:24:06,902
I thought you
were upstairs.

197
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,005
You called me.

198
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,009
- Must be pretty hungry.
- I'm starving.

199
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:56,083
Good morning, Mummy.

200
00:24:57,284 --> 00:24:58,752
Where'd you get those?

201
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:01,353
The garden.

202
00:25:01,355 --> 00:25:04,090
You know you're not supposed
to go outside on your own.

203
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,063
I wanted to
surprise you.

204
00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:13,767
Let me see.

205
00:25:20,673 --> 00:25:23,209
They're beautiful.
Thank you.

206
00:25:30,883 --> 00:25:32,819
I can hear
your heart beat.

207
00:25:33,318 --> 00:25:34,887
How does it sound?

208
00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:38,024
Peaceful.

209
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:20,896
What are your
new friends' names?

210
00:26:20,898 --> 00:26:25,299
Michael and Peter
and Sam and Stewart.

211
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:27,437
Stewart?
Stewart Macken?

212
00:26:28,872 --> 00:26:30,674
I thought
you didn't like him.

213
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,877
I don't have
to be his friend?

214
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:38,982
No, no, making new
friends is good, remember?

215
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,960
It's okay, sweetie.

216
00:27:58,225 --> 00:27:59,492
Stay here, okay?

217
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:06,499
Excuse me?

218
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:14,339
Can you move
off the road, please?

219
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:25,281
Mrs. Brady?

220
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:29,020
Mrs. Brady?

221
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:35,193
It's not your boy.

222
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:39,898
Noreen?

223
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:44,202
I'm sorry. She...

224
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:46,370
She likes to wander.

225
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:50,073
I told her to keep
to the side, but, uh,

226
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:53,210
she's not a great listener.

227
00:28:55,045 --> 00:28:56,146
Des.

228
00:28:57,681 --> 00:28:59,149
Sarah.

229
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:05,321
And what's that's
little man's name, eh?

230
00:29:08,524 --> 00:29:10,624
I should get going.

231
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:12,660
If you ever
need anything...

232
00:29:12,662 --> 00:29:13,863
Oh, thanks.

233
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:28,242
He's not your son!

234
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Noreen!
- He's not your son!
Not your son.
Here. Come here.
- Noreen.
- Not...

235
00:30:57,996 --> 00:30:59,597
I'm just gonna
stop for one minute.

236
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:13,644
Don't move a muscle,
okay?

237
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:33,129
Noreen?

238
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

239
00:32:01,423 --> 00:32:03,991
"I then
approached the woman.

240
00:32:03,993 --> 00:32:07,894
"She was crouched down on the
ground in front of her house.

241
00:32:07,896 --> 00:32:12,432
"I thought she was looking for
something, maybe something she had lost.

242
00:32:12,434 --> 00:32:17,071
"But when I got closer, I saw that
her head was buried in the ground.

243
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,072
"And I tried to dig it out

244
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:23,344
"but I was...
I was terrified."

245
00:32:41,895 --> 00:32:45,365
Ms. O'Neill.
Are you happy to sign this?

246
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:49,768
Ms. O'Neill?

247
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:53,171
- Ms. O'Neill?
- I'm strong.

248
00:32:53,173 --> 00:32:55,206
Do you want to change anything
I've read back to you?

249
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,253
Morning.

250
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,387
Hey.

251
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,121
I thought I told you
to take a few days.

252
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,857
I know, I'm just not good
at sitting around the house.

253
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:52,464
Oh, I hear ya, why'd you
think I opened this place?

254
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:59,436
- So, how was your weekend?
- Fine.

255
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:04,141
Must've been
quite a shock.

256
00:34:04,975 --> 00:34:06,410
Finding her like that.

257
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:12,682
Is it true?

258
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:14,585
The way she was?

259
00:34:16,452 --> 00:34:19,286
Sorry, I don't mean
to probe, sorry.

260
00:34:19,288 --> 00:34:21,257
- It's so bizarre.
- I know.

261
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:24,527
And how's Chris?

262
00:34:27,729 --> 00:34:29,532
Yeah, he's fine, thanks.

263
00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:37,404
Do you ever look at your
kids and not recognize them?

264
00:34:37,406 --> 00:34:40,673
Yeah, twins are usually
hidden under a layer of shite

265
00:34:40,675 --> 00:34:42,075
or food or both.

266
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:43,576
And as for Saiorse...

267
00:34:43,578 --> 00:34:46,045
Jesus, it's all about
the eyebrows these days.

268
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:48,583
Not how they look,
but how they are.

269
00:34:49,884 --> 00:34:51,017
Their personalities.

270
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:52,751
Of course.

271
00:34:52,753 --> 00:34:55,723
They swing from monsters to angels
and back again in the blink of an eye.

272
00:34:59,827 --> 00:35:00,828
You all right?

273
00:35:02,531 --> 00:35:03,632
Yeah.

274
00:35:04,298 --> 00:35:05,866
Just a funny few days.

275
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:36,853
Sarah.

276
00:36:40,756 --> 00:36:42,292
Sorry for your loss.

277
00:36:44,127 --> 00:36:46,527
I'm just glad
she's at peace now.

278
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:49,731
They wanted me
to put a lid on,

279
00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:51,534
but she'll be
in the dark long enough.

280
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,672
Will you join me?

281
00:36:57,539 --> 00:36:59,275
Okay.

282
00:37:00,976 --> 00:37:02,044
Thanks.

283
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:12,486
James. He, uh...

284
00:37:12,488 --> 00:37:14,688
lost that tooth
playing hurling.

285
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,426
he thought it
a badge of honor.

286
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,364
He's cute.

287
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:26,000
He was.

288
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,305
I
remember the day he was born.

289
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:37,844
Noreen said she finally understood
what life was all about.

290
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,014
We both did.

291
00:37:44,818 --> 00:37:49,089
You? Did you get that same feeling
when your little man was born?

292
00:37:51,258 --> 00:37:54,858
And what's his name? I didn't
catch it the last time we met.

293
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,861
Christopher.

294
00:37:56,596 --> 00:37:57,863
Chris.

295
00:38:02,536 --> 00:38:04,437
She didn't mean him
any harm, you know.

296
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:13,012
Why did she say
he wasn't my son?

297
00:38:14,347 --> 00:38:15,847
That's what Noreen did.

298
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,086
Just after his eighth birthday,
Noreen started to say that

299
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:24,956
James was different.

300
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:32,763
She saw tiny, insignificant
things only a mother would notice.

301
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:37,233
It was like little pebbles
rolling down a hill, you know?

302
00:38:37,235 --> 00:38:39,637
Then you blink
and it becomes a landslide.

303
00:38:40,772 --> 00:38:43,842
A specialist gave some
fancy name for whatever

304
00:38:44,275 --> 00:38:45,675
fuse had popped,

305
00:38:45,677 --> 00:38:48,580
but putting a label on it
didn't make her any better.

306
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:51,949
She was convinced.

307
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,719
Of what?

308
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,088
That he was
an impostor.

309
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:01,458
Wasn't her son.

310
00:39:02,826 --> 00:39:05,560
I suppose when
she saw your Chris,

311
00:39:05,562 --> 00:39:08,465
it reminded her
of her James.

312
00:39:09,198 --> 00:39:10,768
What happened to him?

313
00:39:11,401 --> 00:39:12,902
He was hit by a car.

314
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,672
My car.

315
00:39:17,808 --> 00:39:20,076
I didn't see him
dart out on the road.

316
00:39:26,182 --> 00:39:30,420
Well, here I am, eh?

317
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,554
Maudlin as that bunch of

318
00:39:33,556 --> 00:39:36,659
professional mourners
lurking out there.

319
00:39:45,233 --> 00:39:47,202
I almost think it's better to

320
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,838
remember happier times.

321
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:55,677
Thanks for coming by.

322
00:42:29,891 --> 00:42:32,157
Do you remember those beautiful
flowers you picked for me

323
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,226
in the garden?

324
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:36,028
Yes.

325
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,699
Have you been going
anywhere else?

326
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:40,635
No.

327
00:42:41,335 --> 00:42:42,837
Like the forest maybe?

328
00:42:46,473 --> 00:42:47,908
No, Mummy.

329
00:42:51,678 --> 00:42:53,712
So, how's Chuck doing?

330
00:42:53,714 --> 00:42:55,716
Haven't seen you
play with him lately.

331
00:42:56,683 --> 00:42:58,384
Still your
favorite, right?

332
00:43:04,523 --> 00:43:07,424
Are you sure you haven't been
going into the forest on your own?

333
00:43:07,426 --> 00:43:09,295
No, Mummy.

334
00:43:11,497 --> 00:43:13,100
Then how did he
get out there?

335
00:43:15,534 --> 00:43:16,900
No more lies,
Christopher.

336
00:43:16,902 --> 00:43:18,669
- I'm not.
- Tell me the truth.

337
00:43:18,671 --> 00:43:21,972
- I am.
- Tell me the truth.

338
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,407
- Tell me the truth.
- I am!

339
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:25,676
Stop lying to me.

340
00:43:25,678 --> 00:43:27,212
I'm not lying!

341
00:43:33,151 --> 00:43:34,352
I'm sorry, Mummy.

342
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

343
00:46:34,524 --> 00:46:35,525
Mummy?

344
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,594
Is that you?

345
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:47,037
Mummy?

346
00:46:48,337 --> 00:46:49,606
Chris.

347
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,441
Where are you?

348
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:55,912
In bed, why?

349
00:47:03,986 --> 00:47:05,454
Good night, Mummy.

350
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:09,859
Good night, sweetie.

351
00:47:20,835 --> 00:47:22,204
And in...

352
00:47:23,371 --> 00:47:24,439
And out.

353
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:27,442
And in...

354
00:47:28,643 --> 00:47:30,011
And out.

355
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,747
And a big,
deep one.

356
00:47:35,884 --> 00:47:37,449
And out.

357
00:47:38,953 --> 00:47:42,355
<i>It's not the most unusual
thing I've heard of a kid eating.</i>

358
00:47:42,357 --> 00:47:44,391
Yeah, but he usually
is petrified of them.

359
00:47:47,594 --> 00:47:49,663
There's something
not right with him lately.

360
00:47:50,864 --> 00:47:53,267
I can't put my finger on it,
but I know.

361
00:47:54,868 --> 00:47:56,968
I just know
he's not himself.

362
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,204
And how
are you feeling?

363
00:47:59,206 --> 00:48:00,941
Is the medication helping?

364
00:48:07,914 --> 00:48:10,150
May I ask you
a personal question?

365
00:48:10,549 --> 00:48:11,916
Yeah.

366
00:48:11,918 --> 00:48:14,620
Chris' father,
is he around?

367
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:20,660
And that scar
on your head...

368
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:24,462
Was it actually
an accident, Sarah?

369
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:12,176
<i>Hired me,
right there on the spot.</i>

370
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,715
<i>So, which one
of you boys can sing?</i>

371
00:50:27,181 --> 00:50:28,681
What are you doing, Mummy?

372
00:50:31,618 --> 00:50:32,786
Washing.

373
00:51:23,101 --> 00:51:24,335
Morning.

374
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:26,838
I finished it.

375
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,808
Are you hungry?
Come on.

376
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,501
You know I love you
very much, sweetie.

377
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:03,170
I'm sorry if I've been acting
little strange lately.

378
00:52:03,172 --> 00:52:05,405
It's just that...

379
00:52:05,407 --> 00:52:07,708
sometimes when
you're a grownup,

380
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,645
life gets
all blocked up with worry.

381
00:52:12,982 --> 00:52:15,215
Then I look at you,

382
00:52:15,217 --> 00:52:17,253
and I remember
what life is really all about.

383
00:52:28,897 --> 00:52:30,231
Chris.

The valley-o

411
00:55:45,085 --> 00:55:46,353
Sarah.

412
00:55:48,655 --> 00:55:49,986
Sarah.

413
00:55:49,988 --> 00:55:51,358
Are you all right?

414
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:54,157
Sarah.

415
00:55:58,732 --> 00:55:59,865
He's not my son.

416
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,035
Chris?

417
00:56:05,104 --> 00:56:06,436
Whose son is he?

418
00:56:06,438 --> 00:56:08,739
I don't know, but it's not Chris.
It's not him.

419
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:10,240
I don't know what you're...

420
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,743
I know I sound crazy, but if
it was yours, you would know.

421
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:14,176
Okay.

422
00:56:14,178 --> 00:56:15,581
Let's go for a walk.

423
00:56:17,014 --> 00:56:18,481
Sarah.

424
00:56:18,483 --> 00:56:19,884
Let's get some air.

425
00:56:23,221 --> 00:56:24,589
Did you see me?

426
00:56:26,391 --> 00:56:27,658
Mummy?

427
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,924
What's wrong?

428
00:56:29,926 --> 00:56:31,095
Wasn't he brilliant?

429
00:56:33,331 --> 00:56:34,730
Sarah.

430
00:56:34,732 --> 00:56:36,099
You okay, Ms. O'Neill?

431
00:56:36,933 --> 00:56:38,101
Mummy?

432
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:45,475
Mummy?

433
00:57:43,197 --> 00:57:46,233
I've seen myself
grow old from too many angles.

434
00:57:48,937 --> 00:57:50,803
Even after 30 years,

435
00:57:50,805 --> 00:57:53,038
she still
checked me every day.

436
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,107
Checked you for what?

437
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:56,710
That I was still me.

438
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:01,114
The mirror
always tells the truth.

439
00:58:02,483 --> 00:58:03,983
That's what she'd say.

440
00:58:10,624 --> 00:58:13,257
I need to
show you something.

441
00:58:13,259 --> 00:58:16,761
What was wrong with James,
I think it's happening to Chris.

442
00:58:16,763 --> 00:58:19,330
There was nothing
wrong with James.

443
00:58:19,332 --> 00:58:21,532
Please, just look at it.

444
00:58:21,534 --> 00:58:23,002
<i>What are
you doing, Mummy?</i>

445
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:25,703
Please.

446
00:58:25,705 --> 00:58:27,638
<i>Washing.</i>

447
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,976
<i>Why don't you stay up here
and play with your toys?</i>

448
00:58:37,082 --> 00:58:38,550
Do you see it?

449
00:58:40,218 --> 00:58:41,720
That can't be my son.

450
00:58:44,322 --> 00:58:46,791
Tell me you see him.
Tell me.

451
00:58:49,628 --> 00:58:52,227
I'm sorry.
I can't see anything.

452
00:58:52,229 --> 00:58:53,730
Noreen was right.

453
00:58:53,732 --> 00:58:55,197
- No.
- He wasn't your son!

454
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,534
- Enough.
- Chris isn't Chris, and James wasn't James.

455
00:58:58,536 --> 00:58:59,838
Enough!

456
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:13,217
Then tell me I'm wrong.

457
00:59:14,418 --> 00:59:16,185
Tell me I'm crazy.
Tell me.

458
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,659
I can't.

459
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:03,699
Mummy?

460
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:10,906
Why did you run away
from me at school?

461
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:15,209
I wasn't feeling too good.

462
01:00:17,545 --> 01:00:19,046
Do you feel better now?

463
01:00:20,314 --> 01:00:22,316
Yeah. Much.

464
01:00:25,886 --> 01:00:28,656
You won't run away
from me again, will you?

465
01:00:30,091 --> 01:00:31,224
No.

466
01:00:33,027 --> 01:00:35,261
I don't like
being left on my own.

467
01:00:43,036 --> 01:00:44,304
You hungry?

468
01:00:47,407 --> 01:00:48,775
I'll make your favorite.

469
01:01:12,765 --> 01:01:14,332
I love you, Mummy.

470
01:01:15,734 --> 01:01:17,168
I love you, too.

471
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,748
Dinner's ready.

472
01:01:42,693 --> 01:01:44,227
Come on,
before it gets cold.

473
01:01:57,774 --> 01:02:00,075
Don't you want some?

474
01:02:00,077 --> 01:02:02,079
You know I don't
like the dust cheese, remember?

475
01:02:49,356 --> 01:02:51,192
You know what
we haven't played in a while?

476
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,195
Our game.

477
01:02:56,197 --> 01:02:57,397
Our favorite.

478
01:03:06,405 --> 01:03:07,808
Three.

479
01:03:15,448 --> 01:03:16,816
Two.

480
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,324
One.

481
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:35,467
You're not my son.

482
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:43,875
You're not Chris.

483
01:03:47,646 --> 01:03:49,080
You're not my son.

484
01:03:51,783 --> 01:03:53,251
You're not my son.

485
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,324
You're not my son.

486
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,130
What's
wrong with you, Mummy?

487
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:08,166
You're not my son.

488
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,646
Get your
hands off me.

489
01:04:28,418 --> 01:04:30,221
Don't, please!

490
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

491
01:09:03,148 --> 01:09:04,615
What have you
done with him?

492
01:09:10,387 --> 01:09:11,954
What have you
done with him?

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

494

It's me.
It's Momma Bear.

01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:26,409
Chris, wake up.

497
01:19:27,377 --> 01:19:28,713
Chris.

498
01:19:29,546 --> 01:19:31,882
Wake up. Wake up.

499
01:19:36,187 --> 01:19:37,387
Come on.

500
01:19:39,289 --> 01:19:40,423
Chris, wake up.

501
01:19:41,658 --> 01:19:43,727
Yeah, yeah.

502
01:19:44,394 --> 01:19:46,427
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:46,429 --> 01:19:47,764
Yeah.

Okay, okay.
