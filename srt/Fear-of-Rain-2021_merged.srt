00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:10,723
Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey!

3
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:16,461
Hey! Hey!

4
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:14,386
Stop! Stop!
He's coming.

5
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:15,221
Hold on.

6
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:17,322
- He's coming!
- Let me go! No!

7
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:21,861
Stop!
You're making it worse! Stop!

8
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:23,663
- Don't tie her down! Stop!
- Go ahead.

9
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,030
The medicine
makes her a zombie.

10
00:03:58,064 --> 00:04:00,599
Of course she's going to try
to wean herself off of it.

11
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:01,868
It doesn't make
any sense.

12
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,535
Here's your checklist,
Rain.

13
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:20,418
It's been years,
and that's the best you can do?

14
00:04:20,953 --> 00:04:22,587
- <i>Yes.</i>
- You're a doctor.

15
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,690
Jumping to anger isn't helping.

16
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:26,125
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.

17
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:28,060
It's just... She said
she was feeling better.

18
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,663
We see that regularly
with schizophrenia.

19
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:32,865
Patients take their medicine,
feel better,

20
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:34,734
and then think
they can go off it.

21
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:37,069
But it can't be cured.

22
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:38,905
She's gonna be an adult.

23
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:41,606
And then what? We're supposed
to lock her in a room

24
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:42,909
- for the rest of her life?
- John.

25
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:44,609
What? Is there...

26
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,746
another way? What?

27
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:49,614
Short of admitting her
into a psychiatric facility...

28
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:50,883
- No!
- Absolutely not!

29
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,485
Her psychiatrist
can try switching her over

30
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:55,054
to an atypical antipsychotic,

31
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:57,522
which may have
fewer side effects.

32
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:03,195
Hey, baby.

33
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:08,167
Is this happening?

34
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:11,637
John, she's awake.

35
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,441
Hey, baby.

36
00:05:20,746 --> 00:05:22,715
- Hanging in there?
- Yeah. Okay.

37
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:29,822
<i>Again, for maintenance staff,</i>

38
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:32,091
<i>please call extension 405.</i>

39
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,961
<i>Again, for maintenance staff,
please call extension 405.</i>

40
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:36,662
Can I get you anything?

41
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:40,933
Rain?

42
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:43,601
Rain?

43
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,538
Didn't you say you wanted
something to sketch with?

44
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:48,941
Um, wait.

45
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:51,777
Could I have a pencil?

46
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,814
- We can't give...
- Just a soft sketch pencil.

47
00:05:58,084 --> 00:05:59,551
I'll get you some crayons.

48
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:05,523
<i>Dr. Lin,
you got 447, Dr. Lin, 447.</i>

49
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:09,261
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

50
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,098
Whatever comes to mind.

51
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:17,069
Nothing?

52
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:19,805
Too much.

53
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:27,146
Well, let's start with what
you remember then.

54
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:29,581
Do you recall anything
that triggered it?

55
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:31,150
Um...

56
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:36,088
I'm... I don't...
I don't... I remember...

57
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,026
<i>going upstairs and then
being on the bus.</i>

58
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:43,896
But you never left your house.

59
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:46,098
<i>I was in the woods,
though.</i>

60
00:06:46,132 --> 00:06:48,200
<i>There was a man chasing me.</i>

61
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,803
Rain, these episodes
get increasingly worse

62
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:52,671
each time you try
going off your meds.

63
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:54,572
You just... you don't...
you don't understand. I...

64
00:06:57,609 --> 00:06:59,745
I get that the medicine
could make me,

65
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:03,082
like, more stable or whatever
but I...

66
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:05,251
It makes me feel like a zombie.

67
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:08,687
And I... I can't paint,
if I can't feel anything.

68
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:10,923
We can try experimenting
until we find

69
00:07:10,956 --> 00:07:12,191
- the right com...
- Experimenting?

70
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,260
I'm not... I'm not a lab rat.

71
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:16,662
Not taking it is not an option.

72
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,596
One more misstep and the state

73
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:20,132
is going
to institutionalize you, Rain.

74
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,671
It's not fair.

75
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:28,774
People see and hear God.

76
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,043
No one thinks they're nuts.

77
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:35,181
That's not the same thing.

78
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:37,183
Why not?

79
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:57,036
Is everything okay?

80
00:07:58,337 --> 00:08:00,306
Yeah, monkey.
Everything's fine.

81
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:16,789
Jack of all trades.

82
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:18,691
Yeah. Master of none.

83
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:20,759
Mom, what's wrong?

84
00:08:22,928 --> 00:08:24,363
It's been a rough week.

85
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,199
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

86
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,970
It's just... your dad
and I handle things differently.

87
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:37,276
Let me know
if you need anything.

88
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:45,084
Looking forward to having
you back in class, Rain.

89
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:56,729
Grandma and grandpa?

90
00:08:58,964 --> 00:08:59,999
Who else?

91
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:02,768
It didn't work.

92
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:05,704
I'll let you tell them that.

93
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,875
And for what it's worth,

94
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:13,112
they sent me good luck balloons
when I told them

95
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:14,914
I wanted to open
my own restaurant.

96
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:17,449
Yeah, look how that ended up.

97
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:19,418
Sold out.

98
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:30,696
Rain?

99
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:36,135
Hey, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

100
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,873
- Just...
- Stop! Get off!

101
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:13,906
Hey.

102
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:16,775
Don't worry about all this,
okay?

103
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:18,410
I'll get it fixed up.

104
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:28,487
Oh, it's okay, monkey.
It's okay.

105
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,259
Hey. Why don't you stay
in the guest room

106
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:35,027
till I'll get it all
put back together.

107
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:36,395
All right?

108
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:36,121
This is my fault.

109
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,016
You have not lost me, brother.

110
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:06,385
You like strawberry pomegranate?
Are you cool with that?

111
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:08,253
Yeah. Just a normal PBJ
is fine, Dad.

112
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:11,056
It's normal,
it's just, like, spruced up.

113
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:13,959
- Dad, I'm sure it's fine.
- I put my magic touch on it.

114
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,461
Hey...

115
00:12:16,562 --> 00:12:18,197
- I know you're...
- I've missed this.

116
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,132
...you're on your way
out the door and stuff.

117
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:21,634
- Dad.
- But I want you to know that

118
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:22,968
- if you need to chill...
- Dad.

119
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:26,171
- ...and maybe going to school...
- Dad, Dad.

120
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,306
...you might feel a little bit...

121
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:28,173
Dad, I love you

122
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,275
and I understand
that you're worried...

123
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,112
but I'm good.
You've got to let me try, okay?

124
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:35,147
Okay.

125
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:39,351
It's not like I'm on drugs
or anything.

126
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,458
Best jelly I ever had.

127
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:48,628
It's jam,
it's made from fruit pulp.

128
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:50,295
Have a great day, sweetheart.

129
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:52,665
- Love you. Bye.
- Bye. I love you.

130
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,717
Uh, okay. We've got
a lot to cover if any of you

131
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:47,219
have a hope in hell
of passing your finals.

132
00:13:51,056 --> 00:13:52,424
Welcome back, Rain.

133
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:55,662
Care to join us? Come on.

134
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:04,536
So, I gotta see more quotes
in your essays.

135
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,374
I mean, you can't just say
"Heathcliff is a psycho."

136
00:14:11,443 --> 00:14:12,411
I mean, uh...

137
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:14,681
Uh, well...

138
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:20,252
you can't just say,
"Heathcliff is a sadistic ass

139
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:23,589
because he spent his entire life
pining after his childhood crush

140
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:26,325
and plotting against the man
she ends up marrying."

141
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,428
And I'm not disagreeing
with you.

142
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:30,996
But back up your claims.

143
00:14:31,196 --> 00:14:34,299
Let's get textual.

144
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:38,103
Okay? Got it?

145
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:41,039
Do we see nodding heads?
Yeah, please.

146
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:43,208
Good. All right.
Let's get going.

147
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,155
Chicken and guacamole.

148
00:14:57,757 --> 00:14:59,057
Sorry, it's just...

149
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:01,426
I have a strict diet.
Medical stuff.

150
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:14,606
I don't know.
I was just so annoyed...

151
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:16,743
Hey. I tried calling you
the other day.

152
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:24,651
I like your necklace. It's cool.

153
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:27,452
It's a choker.

154
00:15:30,823 --> 00:15:32,659
Do you mind if I sit
with you guys?

155
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:34,526
Oh, no room. Sorry.

156
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,161
Not for all those personalities.

157
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:39,264
- That's not what...
- Be careful.

158
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:41,133
She might go all Carrie on us.

159
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:44,236
Whoa.

160
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:47,172
Yeah, you wouldn't even believe
half the things I've seen.

161
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:49,274
I heard she tried
to kill herself.

162
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:50,609
She's just desperate
for attention.

163
00:15:58,417 --> 00:15:59,418
Hey.

164
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,823
I'm Caleb.
You wanna pick a card, any card?

165
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:08,828
I know it's cliché,
but come on,

166
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:10,830
do it anyway.

167
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:16,168
Come on, Rain.

168
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:19,538
you know what, just take...

169
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,714
You know, it's Tarot,
so it's a little more...

170
00:16:27,747 --> 00:16:29,414
difficult. Do you remember it?

171
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,885
- Mm-hmm.
- Throw it back in the deck.

172
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,287
Really gotta stop talking.

173
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:38,190
I don't like magic.

174
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,693
Well, you're in luck
because this isn't magic,

175
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:41,694
this is skill.

176
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:45,297
Tap the top of the deck.
Just give it a little...

177
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,703
See, this is the really
interactive part

178
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:52,571
where I just distract you,

179
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:55,574
that way you're really impressed
when I swap it out

180
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:58,410
and you flip over your card
and that's yours.

181
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,481
What? It's not yours?

182
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:04,516
No, no. I'm kidding.
I know that.

183
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:06,919
I just gave you that one
as a gift to, you know,

184
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:08,888
balance out your own,
which is under your bottle.

185
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:19,699
Where you from?
Why haven't I seen you around?

186
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,834
What is this, 20 questions?

187
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:24,804
Five, so far actually.

188
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,809
Um, I've been out sick.

189
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:32,244
I mean, you're new.
Where are you from?

190
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:33,680
Uh...

191
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,383
Texas, Louisiana, Arizona,
Arkansas, New Mexico.

192
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:41,219
Uh, must suck,
leaving your friends.

193
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:50,797
Uh, I got to go do a bunch
of makeup work.

194
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:52,832
'Cause I've been out.
Sorry. I gotta go.

195
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:55,534
All right. Well, hey,
if you ever, you know,

196
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:57,302
you wanna hang out sometime

197
00:17:57,335 --> 00:17:58,938
and grab a cup of coffee,
that'd be...

198
00:17:58,971 --> 00:18:01,908
Oh, I can't drink coffee.
Caffeine makes me...

199
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:05,410
Well, me neither.
So, yeah, you know,

200
00:18:05,444 --> 00:18:08,480
if you ever wanna hang out
and grab a cup of non-coffee,

201
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:10,449
that'd be... That'd be fun.

202
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:45,584
Rain?

203
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,821
Rain?

204
00:18:49,354 --> 00:18:50,857
I was just saying hi.

205
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:56,729
Looks like you're up.

206
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:03,301
Hi. I'm picking up
for Rain Burroughs.

207
00:19:03,335 --> 00:19:04,971
B-U-R-R-O-U-G-H-S.

208
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

209
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:13,105
Yeah, as much
as I would love to,

210
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:15,942
I don't... I don't think
now's a good time to be...

211
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:18,678
to be starting up something
like that, so...

212
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,048
Yeah. No, I've been wanting
to get back into it.

213
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:25,417
It's just work's been hectic
and...

214
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:28,788
I should probably
be around here.

215
00:20:29,222 --> 00:20:32,490
Thanks, though.
Thanks for thinking of me.

216
00:20:33,926 --> 00:20:35,828
Dad, who is that?

217
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:41,533
Oh, hey. It was nothing.
It was Phil.

218
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:45,071
He's... catering some events
this month,

219
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:46,873
wanted to know
if I could help out. That's all.

220
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:47,940
You're not going to?

221
00:20:47,974 --> 00:20:49,909
No. I don't... I don't have time.

222
00:20:50,142 --> 00:20:52,912
I mean, no, you should go.
You haven't cooked in forever.

223
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:57,116
- I cook for you all the time.
- Yeah, Mom and I don't count.

224
00:20:58,951 --> 00:20:59,886
You sure?

225
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:03,455
- Really?
- Yes.

226
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:06,726
- I don't have to do it.
- We'll be fine.

227
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:17,502
Rain?

228
00:21:21,874 --> 00:21:22,607
Honey,

229
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:24,944
your father will take the door
off the hinges

230
00:21:24,977 --> 00:21:26,012
if you keep locking it.

231
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:28,714
Yeah, I know.
It's a habit. Sorry.

232
00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:34,486
- Did you hear anything?
- Mm-mm.

233
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:43,229
So, how was your first day back?

234
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:44,764
It was great.

235
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:46,899
Yeah, everyone thinks
I'm a freak.

236
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,500
Oh, I doubt that.

237
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,237
Isn't it cool
to be different nowadays?

238
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,571
Not recently hospitalized
for psychosis.

239
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,641
It's like the biggest event
of the year for them.

240
00:21:55,975 --> 00:21:57,843
It's ridiculous.
I mean, everyone knows.

241
00:21:57,877 --> 00:22:00,179
- Even my teachers.
- It'll blow over.

242
00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:02,480
Someone will get a bad haircut,

243
00:22:02,514 --> 00:22:04,750
or Alexa will make out
with someone's boyfriend, and...

244
00:22:05,384 --> 00:22:06,719
they'll forget all about it.

245
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,023
No, she just...
won't talk to me anymore.

246
00:22:11,057 --> 00:22:13,491
She's got whole new friends
who love hearing horror stories

247
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:14,827
about the crazy girl.

248
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,128
Stop calling yourself that.

249
00:22:16,362 --> 00:22:18,197
It's like I'm a social currency.

250
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,104
Whatever. I mean, I don't care.
It gives me more time to paint.

251
00:22:28,573 --> 00:22:30,009
I think that's what
I wanna study.

252
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:33,179
- In college?
- Mm-hmm.

253
00:22:37,615 --> 00:22:39,051
You don't think I'll get in?

254
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:41,153
No, I just...

255
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:43,555
I didn't know
that's what you wanted.

256
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:45,925
I think...

257
00:22:49,561 --> 00:22:50,963
I think that would be wonderful
for you.

258
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:09,115
How long is this going to take?

259
00:23:10,316 --> 00:23:11,951
Well, it's me.

260
00:23:11,984 --> 00:23:13,919
I'm a spectacularly talented
daughter,

261
00:23:13,953 --> 00:23:16,155
who's one to spend hours
memorializing me.

262
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:18,657
I can actually feel
myself aging.

263
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:22,028
Yeah, you're right.
A lot of wrinkles.

264
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:24,096
Who knows how long that'll take.

265
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,231
Hmm.

266
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:29,235
Bring your sweater.

267
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:32,071
It's 90 degrees outside.
I'm already roasting.

268
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:35,041
- It feels good.
- Yeah, for a sauna.

269
00:23:37,977 --> 00:23:39,011
Bye.

270
00:23:57,963 --> 00:23:58,931
Ready, guys?

271
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:02,301
And go.

272
00:24:07,306 --> 00:24:08,874
Hey, I'll walk with you.

273
00:24:08,908 --> 00:24:11,043
No, thanks.
We don't wanna catch your crazy.

274
00:24:11,077 --> 00:24:12,645
Hey, wait up.

275
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,918
Hey!

276
00:24:20,152 --> 00:24:22,321
- What are you up to?
- What are you doing?

277
00:24:23,856 --> 00:24:25,791
- Cutting class, I guess.
- Well, stop.

278
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:27,059
Why? It's just P.E.

279
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:28,294
Gonna end up
in the nurse's office anyway.

280
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:29,795
I mean, stop following me.

281
00:24:30,663 --> 00:24:31,664
Are you okay?

282
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:35,634
No, I'm not okay. My best friend
won't even talk to me anymore.

283
00:24:35,668 --> 00:24:36,969
- Why not?
- I don't know.

284
00:24:37,203 --> 00:24:38,871
There's got to be some kind
of reason.

285
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:40,773
When I said I don't know,
I mean I kind of know,

286
00:24:40,806 --> 00:24:42,074
I just don't wanna talk
about it.

287
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:43,275
Oh.

288
00:24:45,177 --> 00:24:46,378
You wanna get out of here?

289
00:24:46,912 --> 00:24:49,915
Maybe I could take you home
or wherever.

290
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,284
Wherever?

291
00:24:53,752 --> 00:24:54,753
Yeah.

292
00:24:58,023 --> 00:24:58,991
Okay.

293
00:25:00,926 --> 00:25:03,362
We're gonna be pedaling
this thing like the Flintstones.

294
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:06,365
Yeah, sorry,
I'm still restoring it.

295
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:08,701
How long has it been?

296
00:25:09,835 --> 00:25:10,603
A while.

297
00:25:11,036 --> 00:25:13,205
It wasn't running, so I had
to rebuild the carburetor.

298
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:16,942
I've got new rotors, brake pads,
change the starter

299
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:19,278
and then replaced the rack
and pinion.

300
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,679
It's been about six months,

301
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:22,915
But, you know...

302
00:25:22,948 --> 00:25:25,117
I ran out of money
before I got to the body.

303
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:27,319
- At least it's running.
- For now.

304
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:34,693
Oh. So, is that what
you wanna do?

305
00:25:34,727 --> 00:25:36,395
- What?
- Be a mechanic?

306
00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:38,964
No. Well...

307
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:42,168
car mechanics
and quantum mechanics

308
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:44,703
aren't closely related.
They're more like homonyms.

309
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:47,306
You know, like,
a wave versus two wave.

310
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,909
If that makes sense.

311
00:25:51,277 --> 00:25:54,313
- That's cool.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

312
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:58,751
Okay. We're gonna have to...

313
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:01,954
- stop here.
- What? Why?

314
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:02,888
Uh...

315
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:06,292
My... My windshield wipers
aren't working.

316
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,261
We're gonna be stuck here
for a minute.

317
00:26:19,939 --> 00:26:21,240
Do you have to do that?

318
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:23,943
- What?
- Just magic. Right now?

319
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:26,812
I already told you
it's not magic. It's skill.

320
00:26:27,346 --> 00:26:28,814
It's puzzles, sleight of hand.

321
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:30,449
Everything is contingent
on the sleight of mind.

322
00:26:30,482 --> 00:26:31,784
Everything's an illusion.

323
00:26:32,518 --> 00:26:34,019
<i>Get out while you can.</i>

324
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:35,821
<i>Back to weather
on the seven.</i>

325
00:26:35,854 --> 00:26:37,056
<i>Please, please stop.</i>

326
00:26:37,923 --> 00:26:38,991
Are you okay?

327
00:26:40,192 --> 00:26:41,093
Mm-hmm.

328
00:26:42,094 --> 00:26:44,363
Well, you're fidgeting,
and your face is flushed,

329
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,065
your breathing's
shortened, so...

330
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:47,266
What are you afraid of?

331
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,969
Nothing. You're just...
You're just talking really fast.

332
00:26:52,304 --> 00:26:54,440
I guess I can have that effect
on people sometimes.

333
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:57,009
It's just because I don't like
about inconsequential stuff

334
00:26:57,042 --> 00:26:58,177
like the weather.

335
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:04,149
Which would be ironic actually.

336
00:27:04,783 --> 00:27:07,086
- Hmm?
- If it was the weather.

337
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:11,156
You know, like,
Rain afraid of rain.

338
00:27:12,524 --> 00:27:14,393
<i>Run now. Rain, run!</i>

339
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:16,862
No. I just... I just...
I just wanna go home.

340
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:21,834
- Right here?
- Yeah.

341
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:31,477
It's okay.

342
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:33,979
Oh, you didn't have
to get my door.

343
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:37,216
I did. The passenger door
doesn't open from the inside,

344
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:38,117
so it's...

345
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,825
- Sorry for wasting your day.
- Oh, you didn't waste it.

346
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:49,828
You don't have to protect
my feelings either.

347
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:54,900
This was actually the...
One of the best days

348
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:56,302
I've had in a really long time.

349
00:27:59,238 --> 00:28:00,839
We didn't do anything.

350
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,344
Yeah.

351
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:18,590
- Have a nice night.
- You too.

352
00:28:23,562 --> 00:28:26,198
Look, there's something
I need to tell you,

353
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:29,234
I don't want you
to get freaked out or anything.

354
00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:31,303
I'm, like, sick.

355
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:34,440
No, I mean,
not like cancer. Like...

356
00:28:36,108 --> 00:28:37,176
in my head.

357
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:07,206
Hey, Rain?

358
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:15,314
Oh, hey. Okay. This thing's
gonna go really late,

359
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:17,049
and I got my guys working,

360
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:18,685
so they're gonna handle
the cleanup.

361
00:29:18,718 --> 00:29:21,654
I'll be home as early as I can,
I promise. And I have my phone.

362
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:22,488
Okay.

363
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:24,089
Where's your phone?
Do you have it?

364
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:25,190
Yes, I have my phone.

365
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:27,059
All right.

366
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,032
I literally just told you
not to lock the door.

367
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:36,301
Rain, I'm not gonna tell you
again.

368
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:41,073
- Where were you?
- I...

369
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,008
I was at the library. I was...

370
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,277
studying and...

371
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:49,581
Mm-hmm.

372
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:51,617
- What's his name?
- Who?

373
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:54,953
You forget your father and I
were study buddies.

374
00:29:55,387 --> 00:29:56,555
That's gross.

375
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,092
His name is Caleb.

376
00:30:01,126 --> 00:30:02,027
It's a nice name.

377
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:08,233
I got to call your grandparents.

378
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:10,068
You should help your father
finish loading up.

379
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:55,380
Help!

380
00:30:59,585 --> 00:31:01,453
It's not real, it's not real.

381
00:31:01,654 --> 00:31:04,223
- It's not real, it's not real.
- Rain? Hey.

382
00:31:04,523 --> 00:31:06,425
- Did you hear that?
- What?

383
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:08,560
There was a girl...
A girl next door,

384
00:31:08,594 --> 00:31:10,262
a tiny little girl.

385
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:13,532
- Wh... Where?
- She was...

386
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:15,601
She was screaming for help.
Did you hear?

387
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:19,071
Um, no. I...
I didn't hear anything.

388
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:20,572
Where did you see her?

389
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:22,709
In the...
Over there in the window.

390
00:31:30,482 --> 00:31:33,252
- Rain, there's nobody out here.
- No, she was there. I swear.

391
00:31:33,285 --> 00:31:35,554
She was standing there
and then she... She grabbed her.

392
00:31:35,587 --> 00:31:36,756
- Who?
- Ms. McConnell?

393
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:38,223
No. I don't know!
I couldn't see.

394
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:40,526
Oh.

395
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:43,295
Rain, use your checklist.

396
00:31:43,863 --> 00:31:45,297
Is it possible?

397
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:48,768
No. She doesn't even have kids.

398
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:51,370
Yeah, I know, but that...
That's the point, Dad.

399
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:54,273
Oh, this is ridiculous.

400
00:31:54,606 --> 00:31:56,441
- Honey.
- All right.

401
00:31:56,743 --> 00:31:58,510
Why don't you try to go to bed

402
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:02,649
and then, we'll go over there
tomorrow and...

403
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:05,350
we'll check it out, okay?

404
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:18,297
- On or off?
- On is good.

405
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,802
- Mom?
- Yeah, baby?

406
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:25,838
- Can you stay with me?
- Of course, baby girl.

407
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:41,788
- You having second thoughts?
- No.

408
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:44,757
- Are you sure?
- Dad.

409
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:49,862
Oh!

410
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,264
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

411
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:53,565
I wasn't expecting guests.

412
00:32:55,702 --> 00:32:58,136
Yeah. Can we... Can we just
talk to you for a sec?

413
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,707
Yeah, sure. Come on in.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

414
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:06,511
Sorry about the mess.

415
00:33:07,546 --> 00:33:08,781
I'm still fixing her up.

416
00:33:10,182 --> 00:33:11,450
You should see my place.

417
00:33:12,351 --> 00:33:13,653
I've seen your yard.

418
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:17,657
So, what can I do for you?

419
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:21,460
Okay, this might sound
a little bit weird,

420
00:33:21,493 --> 00:33:25,197
but um, Rain has been hearing
these noises,

421
00:33:25,397 --> 00:33:27,900
and we just thought that
we would come by

422
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:30,135
to make sure everything was...
Everything is good.

423
00:33:30,602 --> 00:33:32,872
- What kind of noises?
- A little girl.

424
00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:34,841
Little girl?

425
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:40,312
Uh, the folks across the street
have kids.

426
00:33:40,345 --> 00:33:41,546
That's probably what you heard.

427
00:33:41,748 --> 00:33:43,683
- She's lying!
- Rain.

428
00:33:43,716 --> 00:33:45,918
There's a little girl
in your attic! I saw her.

429
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:47,720
In my attic?

430
00:33:47,987 --> 00:33:49,789
I have an attic,

431
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:52,624
but there's no one up there
as far as I know.

432
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:56,729
I'm happy to bring you up there.

433
00:33:56,763 --> 00:33:58,597
No, no, no, that's... We're good.

434
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:00,432
- Thank you for the offer.
- Yeah. I want to.

435
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:05,672
Oh!

436
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:09,809
Okay. Well, this does not
make me look good.

437
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:12,511
- Quite a collection.
- Yeah.

438
00:34:12,544 --> 00:34:14,781
I have not been up here
since Gram passed.

439
00:34:16,381 --> 00:34:18,818
She made each one by hand.

440
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:23,422
Their clothes were much nicer
than anything she ever made us.

441
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:26,693
Yeah, it sure does
bring back memories.

442
00:34:30,763 --> 00:34:32,464
Oh! Oh, jeez.

443
00:34:32,497 --> 00:34:34,734
Don't... I definitely don't even
worry about it.

444
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:37,704
Jeez.

445
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:51,583
- Hey.
- Yeah?

446
00:34:51,616 --> 00:34:52,952
We'll get out
of your hair.

447
00:34:54,053 --> 00:34:55,253
You good, Rain?

448
00:35:00,026 --> 00:35:02,260
Thank you for humoring her.

449
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:03,663
That's not a problem.

450
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:08,034
Humor me, Dad? What?
Do you think this is a joke?

451
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:08,935
No, I don't.

452
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:11,403
She's lying!
Did you see the Almanacs?

453
00:35:11,436 --> 00:35:13,706
- There's one up there from 2018!
- So what, Rain?

454
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,440
She said
she hasn't been up there.

455
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:16,642
Who gives a shit whether
she's been

456
00:35:16,676 --> 00:35:17,744
in her own attic or not?

457
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:18,945
Well, you never believe me!

458
00:35:18,978 --> 00:35:20,479
You listen to someone
you don't even like.

459
00:35:20,512 --> 00:35:22,915
Hold up. I get it! I get it!
She's wacko, okay?

460
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:24,884
But she sounds
a hell of a lot more logical

461
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:25,785
- than you do right now.
- Can you just give me

462
00:35:26,152 --> 00:35:27,586
- the benefit of the doubt!
- Give you the benefit of the...

463
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:28,320
Have you been listening
to yourself?

464
00:35:28,654 --> 00:35:29,321
- You can't, I'm crazy, right?
- No, no, no, no.

465
00:35:29,856 --> 00:35:30,622
- No. Rain, please stop it!
- I hear things, I see shit...

466
00:35:30,656 --> 00:35:33,025
Stop it!
Just stop it for a second.

467
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,729
Everything is fine over there!

468
00:35:36,763 --> 00:35:38,396
When are you get that
through your head?

469
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,866
What if that was me up there?

470
00:35:45,504 --> 00:35:46,605
Oh, my God.

471
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:14,000
There's no one up there.
There's no one up there.

472
00:36:17,003 --> 00:36:18,537
There's no one up there.

473
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:23,475
It's your mind.

474
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:29,048
Your mind
is just playing tricks on you.

475
00:36:35,788 --> 00:36:37,924
Please stay away
from that house, okay?

476
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:43,495
If she files
another complaint...

477
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:48,567
the state is gonna put you
in a hospital.

478
00:36:51,804 --> 00:36:53,005
Can you promise me?

479
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:01,446
Okay.

480
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:09,989
Come here.

481
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:30,937
<i>So how have you
been feeling</i>

482
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:31,904
<i>since you've been home?</i>

483
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:33,839
<i>Better than being
strapped down</i>

484
00:38:33,873 --> 00:38:34,974
<i>and experimented on.</i>

485
00:38:37,643 --> 00:38:40,780
I can't sleep, even though
I'm taking my medication,

486
00:38:41,314 --> 00:38:43,615
which I don't really need
in the first place.

487
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:45,651
We've been through this before,
Rain.

488
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:46,852
It's not helping.

489
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:50,122
And I just wanna feel
like myself.

490
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:54,694
You realize if you choose
to go off your medication,

491
00:38:54,961 --> 00:38:56,996
you're likely to end up
in an institution

492
00:38:57,029 --> 00:38:58,764
where they'll force you
to stay on it.

493
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,801
I'm so sick of this.

494
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:05,071
I know things are happening,
and no one believes me.

495
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:08,107
And then it makes me question
whether it's just in my head,

496
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,209
even though I know it's real.

497
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,979
Is there anything in particular
that you're unsure of?

498
00:39:15,613 --> 00:39:16,816
Do you think I'm stupid?

499
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:18,751
Do you think I think
you're stupid?

500
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:20,219
I know they tell you things.

501
00:39:21,287 --> 00:39:22,021
Who's "they?"

502
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:24,090
They told you
about the little girl, right?

503
00:39:24,357 --> 00:39:25,523
What girl?

504
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:27,927
My neighbor is keeping
a little girl in her attic.

505
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:32,031
Rain, this is not like
your other hallucinations.

506
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:34,667
This is a serious accusation,

507
00:39:35,301 --> 00:39:37,903
one that'll likely have
equally serious consequences

508
00:39:37,937 --> 00:39:39,105
for one of you.

509
00:39:39,939 --> 00:39:40,973
I heard her screaming.

510
00:39:42,742 --> 00:39:44,542
Have you run
through your questions?

511
00:39:44,576 --> 00:39:45,244
Mm-hmm.

512
00:39:45,444 --> 00:39:46,979
Did anybody else react to her?

513
00:39:47,013 --> 00:39:48,914
No. No,
she's keeping her hidden.

514
00:39:48,948 --> 00:39:51,616
- Why would she do that?
- I don't know! I think...

515
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,219
I think she kidnapped her,

516
00:39:53,252 --> 00:39:54,754
and she's keeping her
chained up,

517
00:39:54,787 --> 00:39:55,855
and she screams for help.

518
00:39:57,023 --> 00:39:58,190
Do you think it's possible

519
00:39:58,224 --> 00:40:00,726
that you might be projecting
your own fears

520
00:40:01,227 --> 00:40:03,129
of feeling confined
or restrained?

521
00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:14,273
<i>Projecting your own fears</i>

522
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,176
<i>of feeling confined
and restrained?</i>

523
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:50,643
Help me! Help me!
Get me out of here!

524
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,913
Get me out of here!
Help, help!

525
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:58,784
Yeah.

526
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:01,120
What's that?

527
00:41:01,554 --> 00:41:04,023
Yeah, I guess
it could be possible.

528
00:41:32,218 --> 00:41:34,887
- I'm sorry, sweetie, you okay?
- Oh, yeah. It's just a cut.

529
00:41:35,387 --> 00:41:36,689
I was worried you were Mom.

530
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:38,657
I'm making her dinner
to cheer her up.

531
00:41:39,725 --> 00:41:40,893
That's nice.

532
00:41:41,994 --> 00:41:43,028
What's that?

533
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,665
- It's ranch.
- Buttermilk aioli?

534
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:51,036
And I see some pan-roasted,
leavened bread

535
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,739
with herb-infused tomato puree

536
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:55,875
and a blend
of artisanal cheeses.

537
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:57,143
Dad, she's coming! Distract her.

538
00:41:57,176 --> 00:41:58,010
- Right.
- What's going on?

539
00:41:58,043 --> 00:42:00,779
Nothing, Mom,
please don't come in.

540
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:01,914
Okay, okay.

541
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,168
The singularity is near.

542
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:27,006
We're all gonna merge
with artificial intelligence.

543
00:42:27,273 --> 00:42:28,974
Not me, "we."

544
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:31,343
- But them, "we." I'll be fine.
- How's that?

545
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:34,046
Just no social media.
No cell phone.

546
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,281
You don't have a cell phone?

547
00:42:35,314 --> 00:42:37,349
No. Otherwise I would've asked
for your number.

548
00:42:37,383 --> 00:42:39,051
But I don't.

549
00:42:41,487 --> 00:42:43,122
"Do-nut" forget to vote for me!

550
00:42:45,457 --> 00:42:46,892
- Will do.
- Thank you.

551
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:51,830
Nice kid.

552
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:53,866
Where do you even learn
about all that stuff?

553
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:56,502
Oh, you know, online.
You can find out anything,

554
00:42:56,535 --> 00:42:57,736
if you know
what you're looking for.

555
00:42:58,404 --> 00:43:00,339
It's actually pretty
hypocritical for me to say.

556
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:01,440
- I figured...
- <i>Idiot!</i>

557
00:43:01,473 --> 00:43:03,342
- What?
- <i>Loser is freaking me out.</i>

558
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:04,843
- <i>Get out of here.</i>
- You know.

559
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:05,744
<i>Stupid!</i>

560
00:43:05,778 --> 00:43:06,712
<i>Why didn't she just
die?</i>

561
00:43:06,745 --> 00:43:08,847
- <i>Stupid.</i>
- <i>Freak.</i>

562
00:43:09,181 --> 00:43:10,316
What are you feeling?

563
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:13,319
Can we go outside?

564
00:43:29,068 --> 00:43:30,836
Yeah, she parked to the side.

565
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,038
- Rain?
- One foot, right?

566
00:43:35,474 --> 00:43:36,542
- Rain?
- Shh! Shh!

567
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,143
What are you...
What are you doing?

568
00:43:38,944 --> 00:43:41,447
- They're gonna take me away.
- Who?

569
00:43:42,147 --> 00:43:44,383
The cops! My neighbor,
she called the cops on me.

570
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:47,253
I think they're just on patrol.

571
00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:51,023
You don't believe me?

572
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,959
No. I mean,
I don't know, I guess.

573
00:43:53,993 --> 00:43:55,995
But why would she call the cops?

574
00:43:56,562 --> 00:43:58,364
She needs to get rid of me,
my neighbor.

575
00:43:58,397 --> 00:44:00,899
She kidnapped a little girl.
She's keeping her in her attic.

576
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:02,167
Have you told the cops that?

577
00:44:02,201 --> 00:44:03,235
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

578
00:44:03,802 --> 00:44:06,472
- They're on her side!
- Dude, this is insane.

579
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,941
Yeah. I know! I know.

580
00:44:08,974 --> 00:44:11,143
Okay. You're telling me
that your neighbor

581
00:44:11,176 --> 00:44:12,278
kidnapped a girl
and has her chained

582
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:15,114
in her attic right now?
And she called the cops on you?

583
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:17,549
- Do you realize how that sounds?
- Yeah.

584
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:19,385
I know. Okay.
But have you seen the news?

585
00:44:19,418 --> 00:44:21,487
Look at Dahmer, no one thought
that could happen.

586
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,523
He had neighbors.
But people are demented!

587
00:44:25,224 --> 00:44:26,258
Okay.

588
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:28,394
I just need you to trust me.

589
00:44:28,762 --> 00:44:30,429
I do. All right. I...

590
00:44:31,997 --> 00:44:34,266
- If this is true, you gotta...
- It is true. Okay. I...

591
00:44:34,668 --> 00:44:36,368
I just need proof.

592
00:44:37,336 --> 00:44:40,372
All right, well, maybe I can...
Maybe I can help.

593
00:44:40,906 --> 00:44:42,541
Meet me here after school,
all right?

594
00:44:42,975 --> 00:44:44,543
We... we'll figure it out.

595
00:44:53,152 --> 00:44:53,952
Yeah.

596
00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:55,387
My mom's here.
I gotta go.

597
00:44:55,421 --> 00:44:56,822
All right,
see you tomorrow.

598
00:44:57,156 --> 00:44:58,957
Hey, get in.

599
00:45:02,027 --> 00:45:02,995
Okay.

600
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:09,168
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

601
00:45:43,502 --> 00:45:46,138
Hi, Rain.
It's Dr. Pangloss here.

602
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:47,940
I'm checking to see
if you're gonna make it

603
00:45:47,973 --> 00:45:49,274
to your appointment today.

604
00:46:16,135 --> 00:46:17,670
Hey, where are you going?

605
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,938
I thought you left.

606
00:46:20,707 --> 00:46:22,174
I did. I had to fill up.

607
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:25,144
Sorry. Here. Get in.

608
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,620
Oh, my...

609
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,390
Sorry. I kind of crushed it.

610
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:41,193
No. It's actually...
It's for you.

611
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:42,695
I made you a little something.

612
00:46:42,729 --> 00:46:44,664
- What is it?
- Open it.

613
00:46:46,031 --> 00:46:47,166
Is it magic?

614
00:46:47,566 --> 00:46:50,269
No. You don't like magic.

615
00:46:53,405 --> 00:46:54,440
It's a neuron.

616
00:46:57,075 --> 00:47:00,012
- Really?
- Yeah. You know, I...

617
00:47:00,546 --> 00:47:02,147
It's kind of nerdy,
you know, but...

618
00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:06,351
I don't know, I guess
I just like your brain.

619
00:47:11,323 --> 00:47:13,258
I love it. Thanks.

620
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:21,500
That's her place.

621
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:24,536
- That's nice.
- She inherited it.

622
00:47:25,738 --> 00:47:27,306
Okay. How are we gonna do this?

623
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,708
Uh...

624
00:47:30,075 --> 00:47:31,109
We just wait, I guess,

625
00:47:31,143 --> 00:47:34,012
and watch,
figure out her schedule.

626
00:47:34,046 --> 00:47:36,014
She works Monday through Friday,
from 7:00 to 4:00,

627
00:47:36,048 --> 00:47:38,150
and has a night class at HCC
from 7:00 to 11:00.

628
00:47:38,183 --> 00:47:39,418
That's gonna be our prime time.

629
00:47:42,187 --> 00:47:44,056
What? Did you just think
I was gonna wait

630
00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:45,457
for someone else to fix this?

631
00:47:48,695 --> 00:47:50,362
I'm not breaking
into somebody's house.

632
00:47:50,395 --> 00:47:51,497
I need to know.

633
00:47:56,703 --> 00:47:58,738
Shh.
Come on, come on, come on.

634
00:47:59,204 --> 00:48:01,473
Why can't we come back
Wednesday when she's at work?

635
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:04,009
Who knows what could happen
to her by Wednesday!

636
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:14,486
This is new. It was open before.

637
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,756
Well, then, let's just go.

638
00:48:16,956 --> 00:48:19,324
We got to find a screwdriver
or something!

639
00:48:25,264 --> 00:48:26,766
- Hey, look.
- So?

640
00:48:29,601 --> 00:48:30,737
Maybe she does have a kid.

641
00:48:37,844 --> 00:48:40,178
I found one!

642
00:49:27,894 --> 00:49:29,662
- What the hell, Rain?
- What?

643
00:49:29,696 --> 00:49:30,630
You said she works
Monday through Friday.

644
00:49:30,863 --> 00:49:33,131
It would've been helpful
to mention it was at our school.

645
00:49:33,165 --> 00:49:34,566
It's not okay.

646
00:49:39,438 --> 00:49:40,439
This is really bad.

647
00:50:55,782 --> 00:50:57,917
Walls don't bleed,
walls don't bleed.

648
00:50:58,751 --> 00:50:59,852
Walls don't bleed.

649
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:13,866
- Mom?
- I'm sorry. It was just...

650
00:51:15,034 --> 00:51:17,536
- You scared me.
- I didn't mean to.

651
00:51:19,872 --> 00:51:21,808
Just wanted to see
what you're seeing.

652
00:51:23,442 --> 00:51:24,911
Be careful what you wish for.

653
00:51:28,413 --> 00:51:31,684
So, when am I gonna get
to meet this Caleb?

654
00:51:33,285 --> 00:51:34,419
Probably never.

655
00:51:34,954 --> 00:51:35,955
- Why?
- <i>Lie.</i>

656
00:51:36,421 --> 00:51:38,858
- It wasn't a lie.
- I didn't say it was.

657
00:51:39,624 --> 00:51:41,661
Yeah, well, I know
what you're thinking.

658
00:51:42,061 --> 00:51:43,261
What?

659
00:51:46,032 --> 00:51:47,566
You wanna know if he's real.

660
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,473
Honestly, I don't know
if he is or not.

661
00:51:57,542 --> 00:51:59,679
I don't care. I like spending
time with him,

662
00:51:59,712 --> 00:52:00,913
even if he's an illusion.

663
00:52:01,981 --> 00:52:03,649
It's not healthy for you,
though.

664
00:52:03,683 --> 00:52:05,383
How do you know, Mom?

665
00:52:05,952 --> 00:52:08,721
You have no idea what it's like
to have no one to talk to.

666
00:52:09,055 --> 00:52:10,857
I finally have someone
to keep me company.

667
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:12,591
And he's not hurting me
or anyone else.

668
00:52:12,624 --> 00:52:15,293
So, I don't understand
what the problem is.

669
00:52:16,394 --> 00:52:17,329
It's just...

670
00:52:18,898 --> 00:52:20,032
It could be a trigger.

671
00:52:22,668 --> 00:52:24,336
And you always have me talk to.

672
00:52:24,737 --> 00:52:26,338
That's just not the same.

673
00:52:27,974 --> 00:52:29,341
Why? Because I'm real?

674
00:52:35,413 --> 00:52:36,883
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

675
00:52:38,017 --> 00:52:39,018
I just...

676
00:52:41,754 --> 00:52:44,623
I wanna get better.
I really... I do.

677
00:52:49,695 --> 00:52:51,664
Sometimes I'm just afraid
to lose it all.

678
00:52:54,634 --> 00:52:55,567
I know, baby.

679
00:52:57,703 --> 00:52:58,603
I know.

680
00:53:27,432 --> 00:53:28,366
Hey!

681
00:53:29,534 --> 00:53:31,070
Let's skip class
and go back to her place.

682
00:53:31,737 --> 00:53:33,039
- You're joking, right?
- No.

683
00:53:36,642 --> 00:53:39,377
Rain, I'm not about to break
into my teacher's house!

684
00:53:39,411 --> 00:53:41,346
Well, you kind of already did.

685
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:43,381
Well, I'm not doing it again.

686
00:53:43,749 --> 00:53:46,819
Can't we just hang out
and do something normal?

687
00:54:45,077 --> 00:54:46,812
<i>Hey, let's go back
to the school.</i>

688
00:54:46,846 --> 00:54:48,580
<i>I have an idea and this time
it doesn't involve</i>

689
00:54:48,613 --> 00:54:50,049
<i>anything, you know, illegal.</i>

690
00:54:50,615 --> 00:54:52,718
<i>I've been looking online
for two weeks.</i>

691
00:54:52,752 --> 00:54:53,551
<i>You're not gonna find her.</i>

692
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,989
Well, you are severely
underestimating my skills here.

693
00:54:57,422 --> 00:55:00,960
- How old would you say she was?
- Three or four.

694
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,796
There's so many of them.

695
00:55:04,764 --> 00:55:06,966
The world's full of monsters.

696
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,468
All right. Well,
we're just gonna have...

697
00:55:10,502 --> 00:55:11,771
- to start in Florida.
- Okay.

698
00:55:12,805 --> 00:55:15,074
And just move out from there.

699
00:55:17,143 --> 00:55:19,178
No. Scroll down.

700
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:22,949
You can't even search by gender.
It's just...

701
00:55:22,982 --> 00:55:26,252
Um... Okay. Try, like...
Try Georgia or something.

702
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:29,755
- Any of these look familiar?
- Go to that one.

703
00:55:30,156 --> 00:55:31,523
- This one?
- Yeah.

704
00:55:33,525 --> 00:55:34,827
No, that's not her.

705
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:38,898
- What about any of these?
- No.

706
00:55:40,032 --> 00:55:43,002
You know, that kind that looks...
Okay, no. That's not it.

707
00:55:43,669 --> 00:55:47,073
Okay. Go back. Try, um...
Try South Carolina.

708
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:51,944
Keep going. Scroll, scroll.

709
00:55:53,045 --> 00:55:54,080
No.

710
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:56,215
Go back. Try Alabama.

711
00:55:58,951 --> 00:56:01,519
I'm telling you,
she had this really curly hair.

712
00:56:02,554 --> 00:56:03,723
Hmm?

713
00:56:04,824 --> 00:56:05,691
Mm-mm.

714
00:56:06,826 --> 00:56:07,960
Try North Carolina.

715
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,231
Wait, wait, go back up.

716
00:56:16,869 --> 00:56:17,770
Oh, my...

717
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:25,311
Oh, my God. That... that's her.
That's the little girl.

718
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:26,846
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

719
00:56:27,313 --> 00:56:30,016
Malia Robinson
missing from Pender County

720
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:31,717
since February.

721
00:56:32,985 --> 00:56:34,854
Believed to be abducted
from her home.

722
00:56:34,887 --> 00:56:35,821
Oh, my God. This is... this...

723
00:56:36,022 --> 00:56:39,692
You're ama... Oh, my God.
We need to call her parents.

724
00:56:40,292 --> 00:56:41,727
And tell them what?

725
00:56:42,028 --> 00:56:44,596
Well, tell them
that we found her, like...

726
00:56:44,797 --> 00:56:46,265
Are you sure that's a good idea?

727
00:56:46,298 --> 00:56:47,900
I'm like...
I'm like freaking out right now.

728
00:56:47,933 --> 00:56:50,803
I need to... Um, I need to grab
a drink of water a bit.

729
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:52,570
I'll be right back. Uh, find...

730
00:56:52,604 --> 00:56:55,241
Find her contact information,
and I'll... I'll be right back.

731
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:01,013
Why are you taking it out on me?
I'm not the one who left.

732
00:57:03,615 --> 00:57:04,316
Hello?

733
00:57:05,885 --> 00:57:06,786
Hello?

734
00:57:11,023 --> 00:57:12,925
- God.
- Is everything okay?

735
00:57:18,697 --> 00:57:19,632
My parents...

736
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,035
they just won't even
speak to each other.

737
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:26,272
I have no way
of paying for college.

738
00:57:26,305 --> 00:57:28,040
And it's not just fair,
you know.

739
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:31,277
I don't wanna get stuck here.
It's not my fault!

740
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,282
I... I feel like I can't breathe.

741
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:38,818
No, wait, I can help.

742
00:57:38,851 --> 00:57:40,352
- We can grab a...
- Stop!

743
00:57:40,386 --> 00:57:41,654
Get away from me!

744
00:57:44,957 --> 00:57:46,959
I think she's having
a panic attack.

745
00:57:48,327 --> 00:57:50,029
Just because
you're schizophrenic

746
00:57:50,062 --> 00:57:52,064
doesn't mean the rest of us
are messed up, too!

747
00:58:13,686 --> 00:58:14,920
- Hey.
- Hey.

748
00:58:25,364 --> 00:58:27,700
It doesn't bother me, you know.

749
00:58:28,501 --> 00:58:30,402
I just wish you would've told me
what it was.

750
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:35,074
They've diagnosed me
with so many things,

751
00:58:35,107 --> 00:58:37,143
I don't really know
what to believe anymore.

752
00:58:38,277 --> 00:58:43,048
If you don't wanna be friends
after this, I'll understand.

753
00:58:49,955 --> 00:58:51,690
You wanna grab something to eat?

754
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,302
I don't wanna be
insensitive or anything,

755
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:05,104
but what it's like?

756
00:59:05,538 --> 00:59:06,372
What do you mean?

757
00:59:06,405 --> 00:59:08,307
You know,
do you see things?

758
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,842
Do you hear things?

759
00:59:10,376 --> 00:59:11,177
I don't know.

760
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:13,746
I wanna know everything
about it. You know, I...

761
00:59:14,013 --> 00:59:15,748
Okay, that's a lot.

762
00:59:15,781 --> 00:59:17,283
Sorry,
I'm being rude here. I...

763
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:19,185
No, it's fine. Um...

764
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:27,893
Number one, I don't have
multiple personalities.

765
00:59:28,662 --> 00:59:31,130
A lot people assume that,
but it's completely different.

766
00:59:31,397 --> 00:59:33,866
All right. So it's just Rain.

767
00:59:34,066 --> 00:59:37,770
I mean, not exactly.
There's a lot of voices

768
00:59:37,803 --> 00:59:40,206
that say the worst things
you could possibly imagine.

769
00:59:40,472 --> 00:59:42,041
I mean, or that I could.

770
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:48,380
I mean, to be honest,
it gets kind of scary

771
00:59:48,414 --> 00:59:49,949
not really knowing
if I can trust

772
00:59:49,982 --> 00:59:51,317
what I see or hear.

773
00:59:52,484 --> 00:59:53,786
But a lot of people,

774
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:55,354
they don't have
visual hallucinations,

775
00:59:55,387 --> 00:59:56,488
just auditory ones.

776
00:59:58,424 --> 01:00:01,126
But I have both, so...

777
01:00:03,295 --> 01:00:05,064
Sorry. I... I know
it's kind of...

778
01:00:06,031 --> 01:00:07,266
- weird.
- No.

779
01:00:09,134 --> 01:00:10,970
It's what makes you you.
You know, I...

780
01:00:12,805 --> 01:00:14,240
I'm different, you're different.

781
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,042
Why should we have
to apologize for that, you know?

782
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:19,445
I don't see anybody else
apologizing for having

783
01:00:19,812 --> 01:00:23,916
diabetes or tuberculosis,
you know.

784
01:00:29,355 --> 01:00:32,491
Look, Rain, it's...

785
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:35,494
it's okay if she's not real.

786
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,883
- I'll see you later?
- Yeah. Bye.

787
01:01:26,879 --> 01:01:29,948
- Hey, you're home late.
- It's only 7:00.

788
01:01:31,317 --> 01:01:32,818
Did you do anything today?

789
01:01:36,588 --> 01:01:39,224
Mom, if I can get out
and socialize, you can, too.

790
01:01:43,028 --> 01:01:44,063
I'm proud of you.

791
01:01:53,038 --> 01:01:56,308
Hey, Monkey,
I've got a surprise for you.

792
01:02:11,658 --> 01:02:12,558
Ta-da.

793
01:02:13,926 --> 01:02:14,860
What do you think?

794
01:02:15,461 --> 01:02:16,628
Yeah, it looks good.

795
01:02:25,971 --> 01:02:27,039
You remember that day?

796
01:02:28,173 --> 01:02:29,975
Yeah. You and Mom looked
so happy.

797
01:02:39,985 --> 01:02:42,154
I think I'm gonna stay
in the other room for now.

798
01:02:43,088 --> 01:02:44,189
Oh, okay.

799
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:32,404
<i>Mommy!</i>

800
01:03:35,307 --> 01:03:36,542
<i>Mommy!</i>

801
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:39,144
<i>Do something.</i>

802
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,682
<i>Help me.</i>

803
01:04:19,686 --> 01:04:20,687
Mom?

804
01:04:22,755 --> 01:04:25,357
Mom, what are you doing in here?
What's wrong?

805
01:04:31,063 --> 01:04:32,264
Is it something I did?

806
01:04:49,581 --> 01:04:51,617
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I messed up.

807
01:04:52,217 --> 01:04:53,352
No, baby.

808
01:04:54,854 --> 01:04:58,156
- No, it's not you.
- It's not you.

809
01:05:01,226 --> 01:05:03,228
I'm gonna try to be better,
I promise.

810
01:05:05,297 --> 01:05:06,431
I'm sorry.

811
01:05:18,745 --> 01:05:20,512
Just like taking a candy
from a baby.

812
01:05:20,546 --> 01:05:21,613
Right, Ms. McConnell?

813
01:05:23,783 --> 01:05:26,351
<i>No one's reacting.
He's not real.</i>

814
01:05:28,855 --> 01:05:29,889
Rain?

815
01:05:29,923 --> 01:05:32,124
- <i>Idiot.</i>
- <i>You're stupid.</i>

816
01:05:32,157 --> 01:05:33,592
<i>Stupid, stupid, stupid.</i>

817
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:35,193
<i>Rain. Rain.</i>

818
01:05:35,862 --> 01:05:39,097
<i>Rain? He's not real.</i>

819
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:40,566
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

820
01:05:43,335 --> 01:05:44,336
<i>You're stupid.</i>

821
01:05:47,339 --> 01:05:49,809
Don't forget to turn in
your papers,

822
01:05:49,842 --> 01:05:52,144
if you haven't done it already.

823
01:06:18,671 --> 01:06:19,839
Like whatever.

824
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:40,459
Rain?

825
01:06:43,528 --> 01:06:45,230
Rain?

826
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:51,738
What are you doing here?

827
01:06:51,771 --> 01:06:53,605
- You've been ignoring me.
- Yeah.

828
01:06:54,339 --> 01:06:55,540
Yeah. And...

829
01:06:57,442 --> 01:06:59,478
I wasn't expecting
you would admit that.

830
01:06:59,511 --> 01:07:01,313
Yeah. Well, I did.
And I've been ignoring you

831
01:07:01,346 --> 01:07:03,582
- because you're not real.
- I am real.

832
01:07:03,615 --> 01:07:05,350
No, you're in prison.
You're a prism.

833
01:07:05,885 --> 01:07:07,219
What?

834
01:07:07,252 --> 01:07:08,553
Okay. Number one,
is it possible?

835
01:07:08,587 --> 01:07:09,421
No. The answer is no.

836
01:07:09,454 --> 01:07:11,390
No one like you exists
in real life.

837
01:07:11,891 --> 01:07:14,292
I do... And what makes you
think I'm not real?

838
01:07:14,326 --> 01:07:16,729
You're just too perfect.

839
01:07:19,498 --> 01:07:20,800
What? Okay. That's a first.

840
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:23,803
No, I...
You're like perfectly imperfect.

841
01:07:23,836 --> 01:07:27,372
I really don't wanna keep
talking about this with you.

842
01:07:27,406 --> 01:07:29,776
Well, too bad because now
I'm not going anywhere. I mean...

843
01:07:29,976 --> 01:07:31,811
This is bad enough
to find friends out here,

844
01:07:31,844 --> 01:07:32,544
much less...

845
01:07:32,979 --> 01:07:35,414
Stop. You need to go,
whether you're real or not.

846
01:07:35,447 --> 01:07:36,481
No, I am real.

847
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:37,684
And you're a little different,
yeah.

848
01:07:37,717 --> 01:07:39,584
I don't care about that.
I mean, I do, I...

849
01:07:39,618 --> 01:07:40,820
I care about it. I just...

850
01:07:41,788 --> 01:07:43,188
I like you.

851
01:07:47,526 --> 01:07:49,729
- What was that?
- What? You heard her?

852
01:07:50,029 --> 01:07:52,632
- I heard something.
- It was Malia!

853
01:07:52,665 --> 01:07:55,635
- Well, it could've been a cat.
- No, it wasn't a cat!

854
01:07:56,135 --> 01:07:57,704
We should call the police then.

855
01:07:57,737 --> 01:07:59,337
- No, I can't!
- Why not?

856
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:00,807
You just said
it could've been a cat.

857
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,474
And if I'm wrong,
they'll put me away.

858
01:08:03,109 --> 01:08:05,510
Okay. Well, what do you
want us what to do?

859
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,421
We're good.

860
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:18,758
Through here. Come on.

861
01:08:29,568 --> 01:08:32,537
Hey. I think we can
get in through the garage.

862
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:54,593
What's going on?

863
01:08:55,995 --> 01:08:58,597
- Enough is enough, John.
- Dani, what's going on?

864
01:08:58,631 --> 01:09:00,365
It's one thing
when she's having issues,

865
01:09:00,398 --> 01:09:01,768
but now she's vandalizing
my home

866
01:09:01,801 --> 01:09:03,669
and making accusations
that could end my career.

867
01:09:03,703 --> 01:09:05,905
Slow down. What? What did...

868
01:09:05,938 --> 01:09:07,907
I've worked my ass off
for my retirement,

869
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,976
I cannot afford
to have that jeopardized.

870
01:09:11,844 --> 01:09:13,378
What do you want me to do?

871
01:09:13,411 --> 01:09:16,082
- You know what you need to do.
- No. I really don't.

872
01:09:16,115 --> 01:09:19,685
You need to take her
into the hospital.

873
01:09:19,719 --> 01:09:21,553
Do you want me
just lock my kid up

874
01:09:21,888 --> 01:09:24,623
and just sweep her
under the rug?

875
01:09:24,657 --> 01:09:28,560
You know, I get
that you're in a tough place,

876
01:09:28,593 --> 01:09:31,363
but if you don't take her in,
I'm filing charges.

877
01:09:31,563 --> 01:09:32,865
Excuse me, hold on a minute.

878
01:09:32,899 --> 01:09:35,500
- Dani, seriously.
- No, I... I'm done. I'm done.

879
01:09:35,935 --> 01:09:38,436
- Excuse me. Dani.
- I'm done!

880
01:09:38,838 --> 01:09:40,039
- Dani, just...
- I can't.

881
01:09:41,373 --> 01:09:42,074
Please, just...

882
01:09:45,912 --> 01:09:48,346
<i>I told you
not to go over there.</i>

883
01:09:48,815 --> 01:09:50,049
- What were you thinking?
- John.

884
01:09:50,082 --> 01:09:52,752
She has a giant doll house
in her garage.

885
01:09:52,785 --> 01:09:54,821
Yeah. She's got 100 dolls
in her attic.

886
01:09:54,854 --> 01:09:57,622
She's weird.
Who the hell cares?

887
01:09:57,924 --> 01:10:00,492
This is all part of her plan.
She's gonna trap her in there.

888
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,962
- Are you listening to yourself?
- That's what she wants!

889
01:10:02,995 --> 01:10:04,496
She wants you to think
I'm crazy,

890
01:10:04,529 --> 01:10:05,798
so that can send me away.

891
01:10:05,832 --> 01:10:07,834
You broke
into somebody's house, Rain.

892
01:10:07,867 --> 01:10:08,668
I didn't break into it,

893
01:10:08,701 --> 01:10:10,468
- Caleb broke the window.
- Oh, Christ!

894
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:11,938
This... This again.

895
01:10:13,405 --> 01:10:16,508
No, she only reported
seeing you.

896
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:17,844
Well, she maybe just
didn't see him,

897
01:10:17,877 --> 01:10:19,578
but he was there.
He heard her scream!

898
01:10:19,611 --> 01:10:21,580
Caleb doesn't exist, okay?

899
01:10:21,881 --> 01:10:24,116
- Seriously, you need to stop.
- Stop? Stop what?

900
01:10:24,382 --> 01:10:26,652
If I wasn't sick,
you would never even be saying...

901
01:10:26,686 --> 01:10:28,620
- You are sick!
- But I'm not my sickness!

902
01:10:28,654 --> 01:10:31,691
Yes, you are! We all are!

903
01:10:41,701 --> 01:10:42,969
You're going to Westbrook.

904
01:10:43,002 --> 01:10:45,470
- Don't you dare say that!
- What? No!

905
01:10:45,838 --> 01:10:48,440
I've had enough of this.
You're both out of control.

906
01:10:50,643 --> 01:10:52,111
Have you been taking
your medicine?

907
01:10:52,611 --> 01:10:53,545
Yes.

908
01:10:59,185 --> 01:11:00,119
Have you?

909
01:11:02,788 --> 01:11:04,657
It doesn't matter
what I say anyways,

910
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:07,093
- you don't believe me.
- Come here. Come here.

911
01:11:07,525 --> 01:11:09,061
- Stop. Get off!
- Come here.

912
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:11,596
Get your fucking hands off me.

913
01:11:16,168 --> 01:11:17,136
Take your medicine.

914
01:11:18,905 --> 01:11:19,872
Already taken it today.

915
01:11:20,973 --> 01:11:23,475
- Take another dose.
- No! Dad, stop!

916
01:11:23,508 --> 01:11:25,011
- What are you... Stop!
- Take it!

917
01:11:26,178 --> 01:11:29,048
Is this what you want, Dad?
You want me to take them all,

918
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:30,650
- get out of your hair for good?
- What are you doing?

919
01:11:30,683 --> 01:11:31,751
Okay.

920
01:11:41,493 --> 01:11:43,428
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

921
01:11:46,198 --> 01:11:47,499
Don't say that.

922
01:11:51,603 --> 01:11:54,106
Don't ever say that again.

923
01:11:59,812 --> 01:12:01,981
I don't know what else
I'm supposed to do.

924
01:12:02,915 --> 01:12:03,916
I'm sorry.

925
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:08,754
Sorry doesn't make it okay.

926
01:12:24,971 --> 01:12:27,539
- What are we gonna do?
- Nice of you to show up

927
01:12:27,572 --> 01:12:28,741
after your disappearing act.

928
01:12:29,275 --> 01:12:30,910
What? You ran, I ran. And...

929
01:12:31,476 --> 01:12:32,411
Well, she called the cops.

930
01:12:32,445 --> 01:12:34,579
She's filing charges
to have me sent away.

931
01:12:34,612 --> 01:12:35,748
What? Where?

932
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:38,818
- I gotta go to class.
- No.

933
01:12:39,085 --> 01:12:40,886
If you leave,
what's gonna happen to Malia?

934
01:12:41,921 --> 01:12:43,756
You mean the cat next door?

935
01:13:23,929 --> 01:13:25,698
So, what's your plan?

936
01:13:26,665 --> 01:13:29,969
We can climb up the ladder
and break through the window.

937
01:13:30,503 --> 01:13:32,872
While she's home?
That's not gonna do any good.

938
01:13:32,905 --> 01:13:34,774
She will call the cops,
get us arrested.

939
01:13:34,807 --> 01:13:36,942
We have to do something
before she kills her. What...

940
01:13:37,609 --> 01:13:39,345
What makes you think
she's gonna kill her?

941
01:13:39,378 --> 01:13:41,213
She knows that I know!
She's gonna kill her

942
01:13:41,247 --> 01:13:42,048
and it's all gonna be my fault!

943
01:13:42,081 --> 01:13:43,615
and I'm gonna be the one
who just sit

944
01:13:43,649 --> 01:13:45,317
and even do anything to save her
or...

945
01:13:45,351 --> 01:13:46,685
- Rain!
- I can't...

946
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,588
We need to come up
with a coherent plan, okay?

947
01:13:50,622 --> 01:13:51,556
Panicking is not gonna help.

948
01:13:55,227 --> 01:13:57,029
Let me get you some water,
all right?

949
01:14:08,174 --> 01:14:09,141
Wrong one.

950
01:14:11,777 --> 01:14:12,978
You take all these?

951
01:14:13,913 --> 01:14:14,680
Not exactly.

952
01:14:14,713 --> 01:14:17,116
They're constantly
changing them up

953
01:14:17,149 --> 01:14:18,317
to see what's most effective.

954
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,653
I can't sleep
on any of them, though.

955
01:14:21,153 --> 01:14:22,620
Studies have found strong links

956
01:14:22,655 --> 01:14:24,790
between insomnia
and intellect, so.

957
01:14:26,258 --> 01:14:29,195
And I'm sure that's what it is.
Just me being a genius.

958
01:14:40,206 --> 01:14:41,974
How can you
be playing cards right now?

959
01:14:43,742 --> 01:14:44,910
It helps me when I'm nervous.

960
01:14:45,978 --> 01:14:46,879
Here...

961
01:14:47,947 --> 01:14:48,981
try it again, pick one.

962
01:14:52,852 --> 01:14:53,819
Nope.

963
01:14:59,058 --> 01:15:00,025
You pick one.

964
01:15:01,694 --> 01:15:03,062
Yeah? What are you gonna do
with those?

965
01:15:03,095 --> 01:15:04,096
Just pick a card.

966
01:15:15,174 --> 01:15:17,042
- Rain?
- Yeah, Mom?

967
01:15:17,276 --> 01:15:18,244
Hey, hi.

968
01:15:20,012 --> 01:15:22,281
I'm sorry. Who is this?

969
01:15:23,048 --> 01:15:25,985
Um, this is Caleb.
Caleb, this is my mom.

970
01:15:27,987 --> 01:15:29,321
Wait, you can see him?

971
01:15:30,256 --> 01:15:31,423
Of course I can see him.

972
01:15:34,994 --> 01:15:37,296
I was so nervous of...
Never mind.

973
01:15:38,063 --> 01:15:39,865
Don't let me interrupt
your date.

974
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:40,966
It's not a date, Mom.

975
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,134
- We're just friends.
- Mm-hmm.

976
01:15:45,738 --> 01:15:47,873
I don't think we should wait.
Let's go Wednesday, after...

977
01:15:47,907 --> 01:15:50,943
You know, actually, I...
I gotta go.

978
01:15:52,878 --> 01:15:55,915
But I'll, uh...
I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah?

979
01:15:56,115 --> 01:15:57,149
Okay. Yeah.

980
01:16:06,325 --> 01:16:07,693
Did I ruin your date?

981
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:40,993
All right. All right,
guys, come on. You're late.

982
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,795
Come on in. Take a seat.

983
01:16:43,796 --> 01:16:44,830
Let's get started.

984
01:16:47,466 --> 01:16:48,767
<i>I told you.</i>

985
01:16:50,169 --> 01:16:51,470
- <i>I told you.</i>
- Rain?

986
01:16:51,671 --> 01:16:53,539
<i>He's not real.</i>

987
01:16:53,572 --> 01:16:57,076
<i>I told you.
He's not real.</i>

988
01:16:57,476 --> 01:16:59,078
<i>He's not real.</i>

989
01:16:59,511 --> 01:17:01,814
- <i>Loser.</i>
- <i>Rain.</i>

990
01:17:04,216 --> 01:17:05,417
<i>Kill yourself.</i>

991
01:17:06,885 --> 01:17:08,187
Rain?

992
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:11,924
No, no! Rain.
Rain, are you okay?

993
01:17:15,261 --> 01:17:16,862
Rain, can we talk for a moment?

994
01:17:17,062 --> 01:17:18,831
<i>You should just die.</i>

995
01:17:20,266 --> 01:17:21,867
<i>No one likes you.</i>

996
01:17:26,105 --> 01:17:29,308
<i>Freak. Freak.
Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak.</i>

997
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:32,544
<i>You're a freak.
You should kill yourself.</i>

998
01:17:35,514 --> 01:17:36,548
Rain?

999
01:17:38,117 --> 01:17:40,185
I think you need to go
see the nurse.

1000
01:17:40,519 --> 01:17:42,921
<i>You're crazy.
You're crazy.</i>

1001
01:18:21,026 --> 01:18:22,161
<i>Hi. You've reached</i>

1002
01:18:22,194 --> 01:18:23,262
<i>the Burroughs residence.</i>

1003
01:18:33,572 --> 01:18:36,008
Hi, I... I need to talk
to Dr. Pangloss.

1004
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:37,876
She's over at the hospital,
Ms. Burroughs.

1005
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:39,378
But I can let her know
you wanna speak to her.

1006
01:18:39,411 --> 01:18:41,213
Um, no, I need to see her now.

1007
01:18:41,246 --> 01:18:42,448
- Sorry.
- She's not here.

1008
01:18:44,684 --> 01:18:49,855
Dr. Pangloss! Dr. Pangloss!
Dr. Pangloss!

1009
01:18:55,494 --> 01:18:56,428
Rain!

1010
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:02,034
<i>Rain!</i>

1011
01:19:12,211 --> 01:19:14,980
- <i>Save me.</i>
- <i>Rain. Rain.</i>

1012
01:19:16,482 --> 01:19:21,487
<i>♪ Rain, Rain, go away
Come again another day ♪</i>

1013
01:20:01,326 --> 01:20:04,563
<i>You're crazy.</i>

1014
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:06,565
- <i>You're crazy.</i>
- <i>Get it together.</i>

1015
01:20:06,866 --> 01:20:08,200
<i>You're losing it.</i>

1016
01:20:08,735 --> 01:20:09,669
She's not real.

1017
01:20:14,072 --> 01:20:15,642
She's gonna die
and you're gonna be locked up

1018
01:20:15,675 --> 01:20:18,645
where you belong.
They're better off without you.

1019
01:20:18,678 --> 01:20:19,978
<i>Get it together.</i>

1020
01:20:20,012 --> 01:20:21,346
- Stop!
- Stop!

1021
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:22,548
Stop!

1022
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:25,551
Rain, honey?

1023
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:30,956
Rain.

1024
01:20:31,256 --> 01:20:32,558
Rain, sweetheart.

1025
01:20:36,228 --> 01:20:37,529
I saw a man
with yellow eyes.

1026
01:20:37,563 --> 01:20:39,598
He wants to take me
as his prize.

1027
01:20:39,632 --> 01:20:41,200
Cries. Cries. She cries.

1028
01:20:41,233 --> 01:20:43,001
Cry me a river
and watch me drown.

1029
01:20:43,035 --> 01:20:46,472
- No sound, it's all too loud.
- No, no, sweetheart.

1030
01:20:47,105 --> 01:20:48,574
Put it down. Put it down.

1031
01:20:50,275 --> 01:20:52,444
Okay. All right.

1032
01:20:52,478 --> 01:20:54,046
You're okay.

1033
01:20:54,714 --> 01:20:56,749
You're okay, you're safe.

1034
01:20:57,115 --> 01:21:00,185
You're safe. You're safe.
You're safe. You're safe.

1035
01:21:00,385 --> 01:21:02,488
Sweetheart, you're safe.

1036
01:21:02,722 --> 01:21:05,692
- Wait, Malia, Malia.
- No. No, Rain. Rain!

1037
01:21:25,745 --> 01:21:28,347
- No, I won't let you.
- Won't let me what, Mom?

1038
01:21:28,681 --> 01:21:30,082
This is your fault
in the first place!

1039
01:21:30,115 --> 01:21:31,116
I wouldn't be dealing
with any of this,

1040
01:21:31,149 --> 01:21:34,353
if you hadn't made me sick!
I'm... I hate you.

1041
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:37,289
Rain, please.

1042
01:21:38,056 --> 01:21:41,293
Please, if you go over there,
they will take you away from us.

1043
01:21:41,326 --> 01:21:43,796
I don't care. What if it was me?
I'm not just gonna sit here

1044
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:45,698
- and wait.
- No. No. Rain!

1045
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:52,504
- Rain? Open the door!
- Mom's making a big deal

1046
01:21:52,538 --> 01:21:55,240
- out of this, and I've got this.
- We need to talk.

1047
01:21:57,276 --> 01:21:58,678
Move away from the window,
please.

1048
01:21:58,711 --> 01:22:00,479
I'm not gonna jump, Dad!
I was just...

1049
01:22:00,512 --> 01:22:03,148
- Honey, listen to your dad.
- You ruin everything!

1050
01:22:04,283 --> 01:22:05,551
There's no one there.

1051
01:22:05,584 --> 01:22:07,619
Yeah. She is! She's right there.

1052
01:22:07,654 --> 01:22:08,554
Your mom...

1053
01:22:14,393 --> 01:22:15,394
She's not here.

1054
01:22:19,398 --> 01:22:22,434
She passed away
three years ago, baby.

1055
01:22:25,805 --> 01:22:27,205
No. That's not true.

1056
01:22:27,941 --> 01:22:30,643
- It's true. I'm sorry.
- Why are you doing this to me?

1057
01:22:30,677 --> 01:22:34,179
I'm not doing anything to you.
You need to know the truth.

1058
01:22:34,814 --> 01:22:36,148
What about at dinner?

1059
01:22:36,515 --> 01:22:37,784
She was there.
We were all there.

1060
01:22:37,817 --> 01:22:40,619
Was anyone else reacting?
Yes, Dad. Yes, you were.

1061
01:22:40,653 --> 01:22:42,487
- You were reacting.
- Because I was trying...

1062
01:22:42,755 --> 01:22:44,222
Dad, she's coming! Distract her.

1063
01:22:44,256 --> 01:22:45,257
- Right, right.
- What's going on?

1064
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:46,358
Nothing, Mom.

1065
01:22:47,159 --> 01:22:48,126
Look...

1066
01:22:50,529 --> 01:22:51,798
I was just trying to...

1067
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:54,634
This whole time?

1068
01:22:56,836 --> 01:22:57,502
Mom's coming.

1069
01:22:57,770 --> 01:22:58,705
<i>I didn't know
what to do...</i>

1070
01:22:58,738 --> 01:22:59,438
Right, right.

1071
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:00,606
<i>...when you started
seeing her again.</i>

1072
01:23:00,907 --> 01:23:03,710
- Nothing to see here.
- Nothing, Mom. Don't come in.

1073
01:23:05,678 --> 01:23:06,646
Coast is clear.

1074
01:23:07,145 --> 01:23:10,248
I tried to remind you
that she was gone,

1075
01:23:10,282 --> 01:23:14,286
but it was really, really hard
seeing you relive that loss

1076
01:23:15,021 --> 01:23:18,256
<i>over and over and over again.</i>

1077
01:23:20,525 --> 01:23:21,460
Yeah, Mom?

1078
01:23:22,862 --> 01:23:24,262
<i>But after a while...</i>

1079
01:23:25,732 --> 01:23:31,169
your reality with her
was just so much...

1080
01:23:31,203 --> 01:23:32,604
<i>It was so much happier...</i>

1081
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:35,742
<i>than mine without her.</i>

1082
01:23:38,477 --> 01:23:42,481
And I was... I was...

1083
01:23:42,882 --> 01:23:44,282
I was so afraid.

1084
01:23:45,752 --> 01:23:49,521
I was just so terrified
that you... That you...

1085
01:23:50,957 --> 01:23:52,659
That you would wanna go...

1086
01:23:54,994 --> 01:23:56,729
to be with her.

1087
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:03,602
How do I know
you're not lying to me? Hmm?

1088
01:24:04,037 --> 01:24:06,873
- Rain...
- How do I know you're not

1089
01:24:06,906 --> 01:24:10,475
- just messing with my head?
- Why would I do that?

1090
01:24:10,509 --> 01:24:11,878
Why'd you lie to me
in the beginning?

1091
01:24:11,911 --> 01:24:14,647
You're just trying to get
to my head.

1092
01:24:15,081 --> 01:24:20,218
- Stop fucking with my head!
- Just stop! Stop!

1093
01:24:20,787 --> 01:24:22,789
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling 911.

1094
01:24:22,822 --> 01:24:26,693
- No! Stop!
- Rain! Rain! Come back!

1095
01:24:29,628 --> 01:24:30,629
Rain!

1096
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:44,443
Malia is already dead!

1097
01:24:45,544 --> 01:24:46,979
<i>Don't listen to her.</i>

1098
01:24:47,013 --> 01:24:48,848
- <i>She's lying.</i>
- <i>This is your fault.</i>

1099
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:50,950
- <i>She's lying.</i>
- <i>Do something.</i>

1100
01:24:58,758 --> 01:24:59,859
<i>She's lying.</i>

1101
01:25:28,788 --> 01:25:30,288
<i>Help me.</i>

1102
01:26:04,422 --> 01:26:06,458
Shit.

1103
01:26:11,898 --> 01:26:12,899
Malia?

1104
01:26:15,467 --> 01:26:16,468
Help.

1105
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:19,872
- <i>Help her!</i>
- <i>You can still see her!</i>

1106
01:26:35,087 --> 01:26:36,088
Malia?

1107
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:42,728
It's okay.
I'm here to help you.

1108
01:26:43,896 --> 01:26:45,064
Save me.

1109
01:26:46,598 --> 01:26:49,035
- Save me.
- Stop.

1110
01:26:49,635 --> 01:26:52,839
No, no, you're not real.
I need to save Malia.

1111
01:26:53,072 --> 01:26:55,641
There is no Malia!
It's always been me.

1112
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:57,810
<i>You should kill yourself.</i>

1113
01:26:57,844 --> 01:27:00,378
No, no, no, no. She's real.

1114
01:27:01,647 --> 01:27:02,715
She's real.

1115
01:27:30,609 --> 01:27:32,979
- You did this...
- No, no.

1116
01:27:33,012 --> 01:27:33,980
...to me.

1117
01:27:36,649 --> 01:27:37,884
Look at me.

1118
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:44,824
You can't leave me.

1119
01:27:45,523 --> 01:27:46,926
I don't want to.

1120
01:27:48,728 --> 01:27:51,931
I'm sorry.
I don't want you to go away.

1121
01:27:53,866 --> 01:27:55,500
I don't have to.

1122
01:28:01,741 --> 01:28:03,876
I don't wanna be crazy, Mom.

1123
01:28:10,482 --> 01:28:13,085
- <i>Help me.</i>
- Malia?

1124
01:28:15,154 --> 01:28:16,889
She's made up, Rain.

1125
01:28:23,763 --> 01:28:25,497
No, she's not, Mom.

1126
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,801
You are.

1127
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:01,961
Hi.

1128
01:30:01,994 --> 01:30:02,962
Here's your order.

1129
01:30:02,995 --> 01:30:03,996
Thanks.

1130
01:30:06,932 --> 01:30:09,201
- Keep the change.
- Have a good one.

1131
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:21,200
<i>It's too late.
It's too late. She's dead.</i>

1132
01:32:21,233 --> 01:32:23,169
<i>It's too late. It's too late.</i>

1133
01:32:25,771 --> 01:32:27,206
- <i>You killed her.</i>
- <i>It's too late.</i>

1134
01:32:27,239 --> 01:32:28,274
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>Wait.</i>

1135
01:32:28,507 --> 01:32:31,443
- <i>You're too late.</i>
- <i>Save Malia.</i>

1136
01:32:31,477 --> 01:32:33,078
<i>It's not too late.</i>

1137
01:32:35,381 --> 01:32:37,082
- <i>Don't do it.</i>
- <i>Go back.</i>

1138
01:32:37,483 --> 01:32:38,817
<i>Keep going.</i>

1139
01:32:39,151 --> 01:32:41,887
<i>No. Stop! Stop it!</i>

1140
01:33:51,423 --> 01:33:54,226
Malia, are you here?

1141
01:33:58,998 --> 01:34:00,933
Malia. Malia, hi.

1142
01:34:00,966 --> 01:34:02,268
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1143
01:34:02,301 --> 01:34:04,970
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. Okay.

1144
01:34:34,533 --> 01:34:35,434
Ah!

1145
01:34:43,242 --> 01:34:45,544
Hello?
Is anybody down there?

1146
01:35:12,504 --> 01:35:13,572
Hello?

1147
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:31,056
Oh! Oh.

1148
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:33,459
Oh, gosh. Rain,
you scared the hell out of me.

1149
01:35:34,126 --> 01:35:35,160
Oh, gosh.

1150
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:40,933
Oh! Here, let me help you.

1151
01:35:41,433 --> 01:35:42,935
<i>Don't trust her.</i>

1152
01:35:44,937 --> 01:35:45,938
Here.

1153
01:35:47,406 --> 01:35:50,342
Rain, take my hand.
That's right.

1154
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:53,345
I don't want anything
to hurt you.

1155
01:35:53,379 --> 01:35:55,948
- <i>You can't trust her.</i>
- <i>You can trust her.</i>

1156
01:35:56,348 --> 01:35:58,117
- It's okay.
- <i>You're just gonna die.</i>

1157
01:35:58,150 --> 01:36:00,219
She's not real, Rain.

1158
01:36:00,986 --> 01:36:04,089
- There's no one there, Rain.
- <i>She's lying.</i>

1159
01:36:04,123 --> 01:36:06,091
There's no little girl there.

1160
01:36:06,726 --> 01:36:08,894
- <i>Either one of you.</i>
- <i>Save Malia.</i>

1161
01:36:09,161 --> 01:36:10,596
Malia, Malia, come here,

1162
01:36:10,629 --> 01:36:11,964
come here. Come here, come here.

1163
01:36:12,464 --> 01:36:14,500
<i>Wait. Don't do this.
She's gone.</i>

1164
01:36:14,701 --> 01:36:18,070
She's not real, Rain.
You made her up in your head.

1165
01:36:18,103 --> 01:36:19,371
<i>You're gonna die.</i>

1166
01:36:20,406 --> 01:36:21,607
<i>Don't you do this.</i>

1167
01:36:22,141 --> 01:36:24,543
- <i>Listen to me.</i>
- <i>Liar!</i>

1168
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:26,612
- <i>She's a liar, Rain.</i>
- Put that down.

1169
01:36:26,646 --> 01:36:28,514
<i>There's something wrong
with you, Rain. Just...</i>

1170
01:36:28,547 --> 01:36:30,516
- <i>You're the crazy one.</i>
- <i>You're crazy.</i>

1171
01:36:31,016 --> 01:36:32,618
- <i>You're gonna die.</i>
- Let me help you.

1172
01:36:33,552 --> 01:36:36,121
Come on. Come on.

1173
01:36:38,323 --> 01:36:40,492
Come on. Let me help you.

1174
01:36:50,302 --> 01:36:51,603
Does your dad know you're here?

1175
01:36:52,538 --> 01:36:54,473
I don't... I don't think so. No.

1176
01:36:54,506 --> 01:36:55,974
I don't have to tell him.

1177
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:58,711
We can just keep this
between us, okay?

1178
01:36:59,511 --> 01:37:01,213
Why would you do that?

1179
01:37:01,246 --> 01:37:02,414
Because I know what happens

1180
01:37:02,448 --> 01:37:03,582
when they
institutionalize people

1181
01:37:03,615 --> 01:37:05,217
and I don't want that
happening to you.

1182
01:37:05,951 --> 01:37:08,454
You have been through
so much already.

1183
01:37:08,688 --> 01:37:11,123
I just don't know
what to believe anymore.

1184
01:37:12,659 --> 01:37:14,661
You've seen that she's not real.

1185
01:37:15,594 --> 01:37:17,296
There's no little girl.

1186
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:24,737
You can just go on home
and we'll keep this between us.

1187
01:37:24,771 --> 01:37:26,673
- Okay?
- Rain?

1188
01:37:29,041 --> 01:37:30,409
Caleb, don't come down here.

1189
01:37:30,609 --> 01:37:34,046
Who are you talking to, Rain?
There's no one there.

1190
01:37:37,483 --> 01:37:40,185
This is your head.

1191
01:37:40,452 --> 01:37:43,622
This is...

1192
01:37:44,022 --> 01:37:45,725
Go, Rain,
get her out of here!

1193
01:37:54,099 --> 01:37:55,567
Make a decision, Rain.

1194
01:37:55,601 --> 01:37:57,536
A figment of your imagination,
or the real thing?

1195
01:38:08,681 --> 01:38:12,752
No, no! No!

1196
01:38:13,151 --> 01:38:15,454
You think I was gonna let you
get away with this?

1197
01:38:15,487 --> 01:38:16,756
I would've let you go.

1198
01:38:17,322 --> 01:38:20,793
I don't want anyone to die.
But you couldn't let things be.

1199
01:38:24,596 --> 01:38:26,498
Get her out of here, Rain!

1200
01:38:38,878 --> 01:38:40,145
Rain.

1201
01:38:40,345 --> 01:38:42,749
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.
It's just me.

1202
01:38:44,651 --> 01:38:47,252
It's just me.
You're safe.

1203
01:38:49,388 --> 01:38:51,290
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1204
01:38:51,323 --> 01:38:52,324
She's real?

1205
01:38:54,192 --> 01:38:55,662
Come on, come on, come on.

1206
01:38:59,431 --> 01:39:01,133
I need to go back inside.
Caleb's...

1207
01:39:01,166 --> 01:39:02,301
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1208
01:39:02,501 --> 01:39:04,303
I got you. I got you.

1209
01:39:05,571 --> 01:39:08,273
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1210
01:39:09,441 --> 01:39:11,109
I need to go back inside.

1211
01:39:11,143 --> 01:39:12,477
- Caleb...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1212
01:39:12,511 --> 01:39:15,180
He's not real, Rain.
He's not real.

1213
01:39:18,751 --> 01:39:19,852
Call EMT.

1214
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:22,187
Hey, there.

1215
01:39:22,722 --> 01:39:23,723
You all right?

1216
01:39:30,162 --> 01:39:30,964
He is real.

1217
01:39:31,196 --> 01:39:32,531
Check out
the neighbor's house.

1218
01:39:34,299 --> 01:39:35,702
Hey, we got
another one over here.

1219
01:39:37,569 --> 01:39:38,503
I love you.

1220
01:39:39,438 --> 01:39:40,707
I'm so proud of you, monkey.

1221
01:39:46,411 --> 01:39:47,814
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

1222
01:39:47,847 --> 01:39:49,514
They're gonna
take good care of you,

1223
01:39:49,548 --> 01:39:51,884
get you back to your mom
and dad. Okay? I promise.

1224
01:39:52,652 --> 01:39:54,252
You're such
a brave girl.

1225
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:04,731
Hi.

1226
01:40:05,530 --> 01:40:07,232
When you said
that wasn't a date,

1227
01:40:07,265 --> 01:40:08,233
what did you, uh...

1228
01:40:08,968 --> 01:40:10,302
What did you mean?

1229
01:40:10,602 --> 01:40:11,738
Because it felt kinda...

1230
01:40:12,939 --> 01:40:14,406
I don't know, datey to me.

1231
01:40:15,374 --> 01:40:17,376
- Did it?
- Yeah.

1232
01:40:18,111 --> 01:40:20,479
I mean, granted I don't have
that much experience...

1233
01:40:21,613 --> 01:40:22,949
with that sort of thing, but...

1234
01:40:22,982 --> 01:40:25,550
You mean, like, dates?

1235
01:40:25,584 --> 01:40:26,618
Yeah.

1236
01:40:27,185 --> 01:40:30,489
But maybe
we can have some more of them...

1237
01:40:31,390 --> 01:40:32,659
when I'm out of this?

1238
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,895
Hmm.
We could maybe arrange that.

1239
01:40:37,295 --> 01:40:39,364
I'd like that. Personally.

1240
01:40:53,245 --> 01:40:56,348
For the first time,
I can feel the medicine working.

1241
01:40:58,517 --> 01:40:59,652
I can finally tell
the difference

1242
01:40:59,686 --> 01:41:01,453
between what's real
and what's not.

1243
01:41:05,858 --> 01:41:07,760
But do you still hear
the voices and...

1244
01:41:08,728 --> 01:41:11,363
Yeah. They're still there,
but not as, like...

1245
01:41:14,801 --> 01:41:16,334
But yeah.

1246
01:41:17,704 --> 01:41:18,905
What about mom?

1247
01:41:21,273 --> 01:41:22,340
Do you still see her?

1248
01:41:27,579 --> 01:41:28,580
No.

1249
01:41:34,821 --> 01:41:35,988
I miss her.

1250
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:57,009
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

1251
01:41:58,778 --> 01:42:00,579
I think I'm gonna move back
into my room.

1252
01:42:00,847 --> 01:42:01,981
Oh, okay.

1253
01:42:03,816 --> 01:42:04,884
Sounds like a plan.

1254
01:42:54,499 --> 01:42:55,668
I'm here, baby girl.

1255
01:42:58,004 --> 01:42:59,504
I love you so, so much.

1256
01:43:00,673 --> 01:43:01,874
I love you, too.

1257
