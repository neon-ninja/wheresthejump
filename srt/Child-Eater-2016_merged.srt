00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,869
Hey.

3
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,170
Sweetie?

4
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,670
Honey, are you all right?

5
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,909
He hurt me.

6
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,839
Look Tom may not be your
knight in shining armor

7
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,709
but you could do worse.

8
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,789
That's a ringing endorsement.

9
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,859
He is more like a court
jester, and self appointed.

10
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,589
Look I've got to go,
but call me tonight, okay?

11
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,359
I should get a break
around midnight.

12
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,329
I bet you look
great in that uniform.

13
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,969
I do, you know I've always
liked a man in uniform,

14
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,270
and now I'm one of them.

15
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,209
You won't say a word to him?

16
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,609
Of course not.

17
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,910
Never.

18
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,049
Fuck.

19
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,499
I could really use a word
of advice right about now.

20
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
Helen.

21
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,070
Great, thanks.

22
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,609
Hey, what are you doing?

23
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,910
Let's go.

24
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,580
What?

25
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,684
The Parker gig.

26
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:49,819
That's tonight?

27
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,449
It's now, come
on, I'll drive you.

28
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,049
Dad I'm really not
feeling up to it.

29
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,589
Can't he find someone else?

30
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,659
Five minutes before
you're supposed to arrive?

31
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,659
The guy just moved in,
doesn't know anyone in town.

32
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,159
Who is he supposed to find?

33
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,700
It was your idea to
look for more work.

34
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,319
Where were you?

35
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,689
Just in the woods.

36
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,313
I told you, you
shouldn't wander around

37
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:49,444
out there by yourself.

38
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,469
I saw that man again.

39
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,329
Who, that old bird watcher?

40
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,193
Lucas, you're going to
have to learn to respect

41
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:56,494
your elders.

42
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,239
You're going to look
like that when you're 80.

43
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,209
Do you really have
to go out tonight?

44
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,109
Hey where did I pack my ties?

45
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,649
I think I left them
in the basement.

46
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,720
Would you run down there
and grab that for me?

47
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,030
Lucas, did you find them?

48
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,119
Casey is doing
pretty well at the station.

49
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,219
I have to admit, I wasn't
sure what to expect.

50
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,520
Great.

51
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,759
You can talk to me, you know?

52
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,060
Tell me what's going on.

53
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,099
Is it the house?

54
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,900
Dad, I'm not 10.

55
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,709
I mean that story
still creeps me out.

56
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:16,679
Eating the eyes of kids to
keep himself from going blind.

57
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,310
It's disgusting.

58
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,169
Thank you so much for coming,

59
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,553
I don't know what
I would have done

60
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:43,124
if your dad hadn't offered.

61
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,869
Lucas doesn't know the
history behind this place

62
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,079
so I would appreciate it if
we could keep that quiet.

63
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,839
He has a pretty
active imagination.

64
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,449
She won't say a word.

65
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,749
I'm going to head
back to the station,

66
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,580
but I just wanted to
make sure everything

67
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,779
was okay, Mr. Parker.

68
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,119
Awesome, thanks,
sheriff, I owe you one.

69
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,849
Don't mention it.

70
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,289
Owes you one?

71
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,590
Christ.

72
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,039
I should get Lucas,
get you two acquainted.

73
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,609
It's just the two of you?

74
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,939
Yeah.

75
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,879
Lucas' mom Linda passed
away when he was born.

76
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,249
I'm so sorry.

77
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,250
I didn't mean to...

78
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:31,119
No, don't worry.

79
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,090
She would have hated this house.

80
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,460
There he is.

81
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,299
Hello there.

82
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,499
Come down, don't be shy.

83
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,169
I'm Helen, nice to meet you.

84
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,640
Yes, the squatter,
yes I remember.

85
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,049
The sheriff?

86
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,350
No.

87
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,980
Yeah, of course.

88
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,560
I'll transfer you right
now, Mrs. Haggemeyer.

89
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,609
Widow's Peak sheriff
office, this is Casey.

90
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,779
Excuse me?

91
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,279
I've seen things, heard things.

92
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,519
Who is this?

93
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,319
Tell the sheriff Ginger called.

94
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,290
Tell him he's awake.

95
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,819
Keep going!

96
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,390
I've got it, V.

97
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,520
I've got it, V.

98
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,213
You should probably
turn this off.

99
00:14:21,214 --> 00:14:23,214
No, no, it's fine.

100
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:25,769
When you have terrible
nightmares tonight

101
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,570
we'll talk about whether
or not it's fine.

102
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,439
What's that you've got there?

103
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,339
It's my mom's.

104
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,879
Was my mom's.

105
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,349
It's supposed to
be for protection.

106
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,590
It's silver and silver
keeps the monsters away.

107
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,960
It's stuck.

108
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,469
What, Lucas?

109
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,529
You hear that?

110
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,839
It's a bird in my bird house.

111
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,140
Your what?

112
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,469
It's so dark.

113
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,180
It's a sparrow.

114
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,619
Sparrow flies through a house,
someone is going to die.

115
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,339
Ginger, you're sure
that's what she said?

116
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,869
Yes, absolutely.

117
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,009
Did she say anything else?

118
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,150
Just that song
and "he's awake."

119
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,550
Thank you.

120
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,040
You weren't kidding about
liking this horror stuff.

121
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,649
Wait.

122
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,209
Could you leave that light on?

123
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,180
Of course.

124
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,860
What is it, Lucas?

125
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,869
I think I saw someone
around the house.

126
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,240
In the woods.

127
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,300
An old man.

128
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,040
An old man?

129
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,750
He's always there.

130
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,249
Today I found a hole in
the wall in the basement.

131
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,779
There was wind in there.

132
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,119
What if it leads outside?

133
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,319
What if he can come inside?

134
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,289
What if he knows about it?

135
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,290
Shh, shh.

136
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,089
No one is coming inside.

137
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,890
I saw him today.

138
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,959
I think he was
going to the farm.

139
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,270
No, Lucas, the
farm is off limits.

140
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:18,770
It's very dangerous, you should
not go there alone, okay?

141
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,939
When I was a kid, I
used to think children

142
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,480
couldn't die, but they can.

143
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,920
A lot of them died, over there.

144
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,420
I Googled it.

145
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,290
You should know that that
happened a long, long time ago.

146
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,029
You have nothing to worry about.

147
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,399
It's time to go to bed, okay?

148
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,700
Okay.

149
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,159
Yes, sir?

150
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,190
I need you to
look up some files for me.

151
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,969
What are you doing here?

152
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,033
I tried to call but there's
no reception out there

153
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,404
and I'm really
terrified of the dark.

154
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,339
You're eating melted ice cream.

155
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,609
That's super gross.

156
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,479
Nope, it's best like this.

157
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,719
How did you know I was here?

158
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,489
Casey might have
told me something.

159
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,210
I do think it's super
weird that I've got to

160
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:24,314
talk to Casey to figure out
where you are these days.

161
00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:27,064
Yeah, I've been working a lot.

162
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,100
So this is the old Bowery place?

163
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,869
Got to admit, I expected
something a little more Gothic.

164
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,709
Did you find any dead
bodies in the walls?

165
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,039
No.

166
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,209
It's just a house,
a normal house.

167
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,609
Yeah, people that bought
it might be a little, right?

168
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,980
Nope, perfectly normal.

169
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,849
Well...

170
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,150
Well?

171
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,289
I don't know, maybe I
don't understand boys.

172
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,999
Did you ever trap animals
when you were a kid?

173
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,729
Trap animals?

174
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,899
Not to hurt them, I don't think,

175
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,140
I think he just
wanted to keep them.

176
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,300
I don't know.

177
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,969
Maybe he is a little weird.

178
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,270
Maybe.

179
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,379
But you know that's really
none of your business.

180
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,609
You should go.

181
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,879
Come on, it will
be like we're teenagers.

182
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,649
I'll be the bad
boyfriend sneaking in.

183
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,589
We're not teenagers anymore.

184
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,390
Helen, who's he?

185
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,959
He's here to help me babysit.

186
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,799
What up, little man?

187
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,100
I'm Tom.

188
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,973
You're not supposed
to have company.

189
00:21:41,974 --> 00:21:43,639
I know.

190
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,270
Tom was just about to leave.

191
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,440
What is it?

192
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,110
Is anything wrong?

193
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,620
First it was like breathing.

194
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,550
Then, a voice, whispering.

195
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,289
See I told you that
movie was a bad idea.

196
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,659
It's not the film, I heard it.

197
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,429
Someone is in there.

198
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,730
Okay.

199
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,499
Let's see then.

200
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,800
Wait!

201
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:15,769
It's nothing, Lucas.

202
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,969
Old houses make strange
sounds sometimes.

203
00:22:18,993 --> 00:22:26,993
wWw.ZOCINE.COM
WATCH MOVIES AND SERIES.

204
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,780
See, empty.

205
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,089
Now you're going to go to bed.

206
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,559
You think I'm making it up.

207
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,729
You just want me to stay up
here, so you can be with him.

208
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,429
I already told you I was
going to tell him to leave.

209
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,269
No you're not.

210
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,069
Listen you don't need
to worry about things

211
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,139
that don't concern you.

212
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,039
There is nothing in your closet.

213
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,679
The only reason you're
scared is because

214
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,539
I let you watch
that scary movie.

215
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,379
What if it's that old man?

216
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,419
There is no old man, okay?

217
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,779
It's just all in your head.

218
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,319
Yeah because I'm a weird kid.

219
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,419
Lucas...

220
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,789
You can leave now.

221
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,490
I'm going to bed.

222
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,909
So was it Robert Bowery?

223
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,679
You're still here.

224
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,579
He's not scared
of the Boogie Man.

225
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,119
He's got a crush on you, and
he wants to get rid of me.

226
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,689
Smart kid.

227
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,689
I think I messed that one up.

228
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,159
What are you talking about?

229
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,319
He's a kid, he's going
to forget in two seconds.

230
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,789
What does that even mean?

231
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,689
If you mess up, you can't
babysit here anymore?

232
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,990
Big deal.

233
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,129
I think it's actually
a good thing,

234
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,239
because you really should be
spending more time with me.

235
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,710
I miss you.

236
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,870
It's good to hear
that you miss me too.

237
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:16,494
I know that's got to
be a complex emotion

238
00:24:16,495 --> 00:24:18,704
to sort of put into words.

239
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,200
Tom, I'm pregnant.

240
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,800
What?

241
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,940
Is it mine?

242
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,889
When were you going
to tell me this?

243
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,690
I just told you.

244
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,030
Are you going to keep it?

245
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,239
Did you hear that?

246
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,540
Hear what?

247
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,549
Lucas?

248
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,610
Tom, check the study.

249
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,009
Lucas?

250
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,179
He's not there.

251
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,989
I think I know where he went.

252
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,620
Lucas?

253
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,260
Lucas, where are you?

254
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,703
Kid could be
anywhere, this is pointless.

255
00:26:40,704 --> 00:26:44,399
No he would have followed
the path, he's a smart kid.

256
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,669
I think we should call someone.

257
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,239
Why, so they can
clean up our mess?

258
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,040
Your mess.

259
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,949
See, this is why
I've been avoiding you.

260
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,219
You can't deal when
things get serious.

261
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,379
Helen.

262
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,320
No please, let me finish.

263
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:01,650
No, Helen, what is that?

264
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,359
That's feathers.

265
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,749
That's his blanket.

266
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,079
Hey wait a minute,
what do you got there?

267
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,409
Just some files
Connolly asked me to get.

268
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,479
From the basement?

269
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,780
Let me see.

270
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,149
The Bowery case?

271
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,859
What the hell for?

272
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,689
What are you looking at?

273
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,229
I should probably get
these to the sheriff.

274
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,859
The Child Eater of Widow's Peak.

275
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,559
Bowery was a weird one.

276
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,499
No one suspected a thing,
little did we know.

277
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,669
My mom says it's
because of those woods.

278
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,839
Said he spent too much
time there, went too deep.

279
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,969
Bunch of horse shit, he snapped.

280
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,379
Developed an eye disease.

281
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,079
Macular degeneration.

282
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,279
It's genetic.

283
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,149
He slowly went blind.

284
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,013
But at some point it
seems he started believing

285
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:39,449
eating other folks'
eyes would cure his own.

286
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,190
Said the younger, the better.

287
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,059
He put a mask over their heads

288
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,089
to make them as blind as he was.

289
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,730
This death mask.

290
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,439
What is this, ghost
stories around the camp fire?

291
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,569
Should I go out and buy
some goddamn marshmallows?

292
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,780
Old bastard was
just a sick sadist.

293
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,329
Did you hear that?

294
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,559
What?

295
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,063
The sound of every
bone in your body

296
00:29:24,064 --> 00:29:26,599
telling you not
to go any further.

297
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,400
He is just hiding somewhere.

298
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,240
Lucas?

299
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,380
Okay you got what you wanted,
we're out here, now let's go.

300
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,910
Stop!

301
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,819
Jesus Christ,
that's a fucking bear trap.

302
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,850
Are there bears in these woods?

303
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,219
What if Lucas
stepped into one of these?

304
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,029
I mean we know, we would hear
him screaming his lungs out.

305
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,489
Tom.

306
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,889
No I mean it, Helen,
seriously, we would know.

307
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,550
Are you in here?

308
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,030
Tom, look at this.

309
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,069
Someone has been here.

310
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,653
Of course someone has been here,

311
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:35,229
this place is legendary.

312
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,799
Did you ever come here?

313
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,270
No but I was never into
this kind of stuff any way.

314
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,749
Used to play hide and seek.

315
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,719
Apparently he was so unassuming,

316
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,143
you could just be
in a room with him

317
00:30:51,144 --> 00:30:53,549
for minutes before you
would even notice him.

318
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,519
It wasn't until
you heard him breathing

319
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,419
that you realized
he was right there.

320
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,829
I remember the stories.

321
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,400
They used to keep me awake.

322
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,770
Lucas?

323
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,010
Hey.

324
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,460
Teeth.

325
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,930
Hey, you!

326
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,899
Hey we're looking for
someone, it's a little kid.

327
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,709
Help, Helen!

328
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,750
Help!

329
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,849
Help!

330
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,460
No, fuck, no!

331
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,099
Tom?

332
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,980
Fuck!

333
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,570
Hello?

334
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,309
Is anyone here?

335
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,420
I just need to use your phone.

336
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,719
I need to call the police.

337
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,929
So close them shut.

338
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,130
Run away, or you'll never
see the light of day.

339
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,769
Help!

340
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,869
Somebody please help me!

341
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,139
Call Lucas.

342
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,010
Please let me go.

343
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,649
Call him, and
we will end this now.

344
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:12,119
He may not be able to see,
but he can hear everything.

345
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,029
He can smell blood.

346
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:18,260
He knows these woods like
the back of his hand.

347
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:21,199
The boy out there with him

348
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,840
or here with us?

349
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,839
Who are you?

350
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,710
I was the one that got away.

351
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,289
They thought he was dead.

352
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,059
But evil never dies.

353
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,929
In these woods, it lingers.

354
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,230
Dwells.

355
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,470
When I was a child, long
before Robert Bowery went mad,

356
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,310
there was an old, old story.

357
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:45,680
They say the stork comes
at night and brings people

358
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,559
their newborn babies.

359
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,689
But this was another
kind of stork.

360
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,729
One with black feathers.

361
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,100
Every once in a
while, he would call.

362
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:10,680
A call only children of bad
unworthy parents could hear.

363
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,483
They would crawl out of
their beds in the middle

364
00:40:13,484 --> 00:40:16,619
of the night and follow
the call, all the way

365
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,520
up the hill to where
the stork was waiting.

366
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:25,359
Once they got there, he
would peck out their eyes

367
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,559
with his beak, and all the
blind babies would crawl

368
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,999
around the woods and couldn't
find their ways back home.

369
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,700
Then the stork ate the babies.

370
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,439
Their blood soaked up the soil.

371
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,509
The trees and the grass
grew from that bloody soil.

372
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,720
That place is built on
that blood of innocents.

373
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,013
Widow's Peak
sheriff's office, this is Casey.

374
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:20,824
Casey, Casey I'm being attacked.

375
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,739
Helen, is that you?

376
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,179
Lucas got lost in the woods

377
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,310
and there was someone.

378
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,620
He killed Tom.

379
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,049
What do you mean killed Tom?

380
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,989
Helen, talk to me.

381
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,470
I think someone is in the house.

382
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,800
Come now, please.

383
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,999
What is it?

384
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,300
It's Helen.

385
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,749
No.

386
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,369
Hey, it's okay, relax.

387
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,570
You're in the hospital.

388
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,650
Tell me what happened.

389
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,230
Lincoln S2S51, copy.

390
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,999
Copy, sheriff, over.

391
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,069
She said there was someone
in the house with her also.

392
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,200
Gave me a description.

393
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:07,810
Tall, long pale face, long
limbs, wearing glasses.

394
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,379
Sir that sounds a lot like...

395
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,323
I know exactly what it
sounds like, lieutenant.

396
00:45:12,324 --> 00:45:14,449
Just keep your eyes open.

397
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:17,519
Somebody is hiding
out in those woods.

398
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,849
Copy that.

399
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,249
We traced them out to the zoo,

400
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,949
we're going to take a look.

401
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:26,359
Let's be careful, there is
a little kid out there also.

402
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,829
So just don't get trigger happy.

403
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,359
I'll be there as soon as
I locate the kid's dad.

404
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,259
Must have been a good date?

405
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,243
Focus on the
task at hand, lieutenant.

406
00:45:34,244 --> 00:45:35,644
Over and out.

407
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,840
Your little friend over there,

408
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:42,424
the sheriff's daughter
might be a little

409
00:45:42,425 --> 00:45:45,209
coo-coo in the head, if
you know what I mean.

410
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,280
Right, let's do this.

Hello?

413
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:15,870
Helen?

414
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,140
Shh, quiet, boy.

415
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,809
Don't you know who
may be listening?

416
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,020
Hi.

417
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,269
Here, for you.

418
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,699
You must be hungry.

419
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,939
And cold?

420
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,679
Why don't you come back
with me to my house?

421
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,409
We'll call the police.

422
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,649
Who are you?

423
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,950
Shh.

424
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,690
Come on, Lucas.

425
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,500
Come with me.

426
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:16,230
No, Lucas.

427
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,339
You were lucky.

428
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,839
The knife in your side
didn't hit any major organs.

429
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,579
A matter of millimeters,
but nothing serious.

430
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,120
And the...

431
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,449
The baby is going to be fine.

432
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:38,190
You are both doing just fine.

433
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,759
Where is he?

434
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,729
Where is sheriff Connolly?

435
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,030
Sheriff?

436
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,699
Mr. Parker.

437
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,600
Where is my son?

438
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:53,109
What happened?

439
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:53,909
Everything is
going to be fine, trust me.

440
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:54,840
Trust me on this one.

441
00:47:54,841 --> 00:47:56,369
Everything is going to be fine.

442
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,210
Nurse.

443
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:58,439
Where were you?

444
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,679
You were supposed
to take care of him.

445
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,960
You were supposed
to protect him.

446
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:01,891
Could you give her something

447
00:48:01,892 --> 00:48:03,879
to calm her down, please?

448
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,219
I will take responsibility
for this situation.

449
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,649
I have every officer in my outfit
working on this right now.

450
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,890
Your son will be found.

451
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,459
This is the place.

452
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,929
What place?

453
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:20,570
The nest, where he took them,

454
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:23,500
to play hide and seek.

455
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,863
Except he knew the
building by heart,

456
00:48:25,864 --> 00:48:28,109
so he always found them.

457
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,893
Come on,
Wesley, give it a break.

458
00:48:29,894 --> 00:48:32,194
We're, we're going in?

459
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:39,649
You two take the back,
I'll check the front.

460
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,689
What kind of animal
did they keep in there?

461
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,859
Something big.

462
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:36,670
Hey, Casey, there is
someone under the bridge.

463
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:50,290
A monster.

464
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,559
You're too stressed out, man.

465
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,423
This job is a lot of
running around in the dark

466
00:49:58,424 --> 00:50:00,629
for reasons you
don't understand.

467
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,770
Better get used to it.

468
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,300
I'm fine.

469
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,789
There's something down here.

470
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,319
Come take a look.

471
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,429
What does that look like to you?

472
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,100
I don't know, mud?

473
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,899
Doesn't smell like mud.

474
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,709
Come out.

475
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,879
It's the police, I
have my gun drawn.

Wes?

479
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,869
I'll check it out.

480
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:03,690

481
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,130
Fuck.

482
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,000
Sheriff?

483
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,600
Anyone?

484
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,210
Goddammit.

489

Hello, I need an ambulance,
please send help.

500
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,270
Dad, Dad, can you hear me?

501
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,240
Are you okay?

502
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,839
Are you all right?

503
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,449
I already called
the 100 dispatch,

504
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:49,709
they're on their way.

505

Just in a few minutes and
I'm going to send for help.

507
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,749
No, don't go back out there.

508
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,889
