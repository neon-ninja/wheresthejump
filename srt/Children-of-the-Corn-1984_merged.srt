1
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,203
Good morning, Elisa.

2
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,080
- Morning.
- Morning.

3
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,291
Reverend, thank you
for the focus.

4
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,501
- Morning.
- It was a great sermon.

5
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,879
It was about three years ago.

6
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,214
I was the only kid
in church that day.

7
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,675
The others were with Isaac
out in the cornfield.

8
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,303
I didn't get to go
'cause Dad didn't like Isaac.

9
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,014
He was pretty smart,
my dad.

10
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:43,269
After church, we went to Hansen's-
just like always.

11
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,354
Sarah was home sick
with Mom.

12
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,690
She'd come down
with the fever real sudden.

13
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,611
Morning, Dave.

14
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,155
- Morning, Pop. How are you?
- How are the wife and Sarah?

15
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,866
Dad was worried, so he went
to call Mom first thing.

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,744
Sarah's been better.
I'm going to call your mom, okay?

17
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,287
Okay.

18
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,498
Mr. Hansen:
I bet dad wants a cup of coffee.

19
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,253
- Okay, Joby, you want your usual?
- Yeah, strawberry shake.

20
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,881
That's when I saw
Malachai and the others.

21
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,550
I guess their meeting
with Isaac was over.

22
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:21,057
- Hi.
- They were acting real creepy.

23
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,850
Francis.

24
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,187
- Here you go, Joby.
- Oh, thanks.

25
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,909
How is she?

26
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,286
I'm worried, Dave.

27
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:46,582
Her fever's gone
from 101 to 104.

28
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,129
Sure.

29
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,616
How are you?

30
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,202
- May I have some cream?
- Okay.

31
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,042
Good coffee.

32
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,649
What's going on?

33
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,818
This young man's
got a weapon.

34
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,028
Oh my God!

35
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,158
No!

36
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,492
Stop it!

37
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,749
Dave, are you
listening to me?

38
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,544
Don't do it!

39
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:17,089
Don't do it! No!

40
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,472
Don't! No!

41
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:43,658
What are you kids-

42
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,041
It happened everywhere in Gatlin that day.

43
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,544
That's when Sarah
started drawing these pictures.

44
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

45
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,056
Happy birthday!

46
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,602
What are you doing?

47
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,525
- You're crazy.
- Come on, come on!

48
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,110
Make a wish.

49
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,958
So what did you wish for?

50
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,586
To live happily
ever after.

51
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,756
- Mm.
- Is that a proposal?

52
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,135
No... it's not.

53
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,303
Okay.

54
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,888
Well...

55
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,432
I guess I'll
give you this anyway.

56
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,608
- Come on.
- What is it?

57
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,657
Oh, that's nice.

58
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,201
Turn it over.

59
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,873
I like this.

60
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,089
In honor of this
special occasion,

61
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,175
we have a birthday
serenade.

62
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,596
- # A one, a two #
- # A one, a two #

63
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,764
- # A one, two, three, four! #
- # A one, two, three, four! #

64
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,142
# No more books
and studies #

65
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,520
# Now I can stay out late
with my buddies #

66
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:45,274
# I can do the things
that I wanna do #

67
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,359
# 'Cause all my exams
are through #?

68
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:51,197
# I can root for the Yankees
from the bleachers #

69
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,742
# And don't have
to worry about teachers #

70
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,870
# And I'm so glad
that school is out #

71
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,122
# I could sing
and shout #

72
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:04,084
# School is out,
everybody gonna have some fun #

73
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,129
- # School is out #
- # Everybody gonna jump and run #

74
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,924
- # School is out #
- # Come on people, don't you be late #

75
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,134
- # School is out #
- # I just got time to take- #

76
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,761
# My girl out
on a date... #

77
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,056
Yay!

78
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,809
You're wacko!

79
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,230
Holy cow!

80
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,779
We'd better get going.
We've got a lot of driving to do today.

81
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,032
Couldn't we just say,
"the hell with it"?

82
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,910
- Stay here for a couple of hours?
- Mm, I wish.

83
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,915
Starting Monday,
I've got 50 patients a day to look at.

84
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,001
I've got a couple
of things you can look at.

85
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,087
Is that right?

86
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,007
Well...

87
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:56,178
Hello? Hello? Maid service.

88
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,847
Um, we'll be out
in a minute.

89
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,767
Oh, we got to
get going.

90
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,562
I wanna grab a quick shower
before we go, okay?

91
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,873
You're making something
out of nothing.

92
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,543
Right. To me it's something;
to you it's nothing.

93
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,963
I'm just worried about
this internship, okay?

94
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,549
I've been working
for this for four years.

95
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,135
I know.

96
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,846
I do understand.

97
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,852
Why do you have to be such a jerk about it?

98
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,527
"Welcome to Nebraska."

99
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,517
We weren't the only ones
who thought Isaac was weird.

100
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,354
One day Joseph told us
he was running away.

101
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,773
He said he couldn't
take it anymore.

102
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,859
He was pretty scared.
I wasn't.

103
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,695
- I'm scared!
- Me too!

104
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,280
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

105
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,783
I said I'd come back for you.
I promise.

106
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,619
- Can't we go with you, please?
- No!

107
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,954
I'd never make it
with you two.

108
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,124
- But we don't like it here.
- I said you'll be all right!

109
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,460
As long as nobody finds
them pictures you've been drawin'.

110
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,878
She can't help it.

111
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,672
That won't matter
to Isaac and Malachai.

112
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,633
They'll take it as a sign.

113
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,135
Anyways, you know crayons
and drawings are forbidden...

114
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,096
just like having
that record player.

115
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,890
But we like it.
Isaac doesn't let us do anything!

116
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,851
Well, you just better
mind him till I get back

117
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,979
or else you know
what happens.

118
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,152
You're not going
through the corn, are ya?

119
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,655
- I can't go no other way.
- But what about-

120
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,281
I said it'll be all right!

121
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,575
Unless you tell
anybody I'm gone.

122
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,829
- We won't.
- Cross your heart? Hope to die?

123
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,580
Stick a needle
in your eye.

124
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,708
Okay, you know what
that means now?

125
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,337
If you tell, you're gonna
burn in the lake of fire for all eternity!

126
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,798
Make sure nobody's lookin'.

127
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,139
Okay! Go!

128
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,475
Nobody's looking!
Nobody's looking!

129
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,815
I spy with my little eye

130
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,901
something that begins
with the letter C.

131
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,487
- Corn.
- Right.

132
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,364
So now we know...

133
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,367
the backroads are even less interesting
than the highway.

134
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,788
Maybe they've
discovered music.

135
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,500
- Halleluiah!
- Halleluiah!

136
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,503
There are many mansions
in His house.

137
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:01,131
But there's no room
for the fornicator!

138
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,091
- Oh no room!
- No room...

139
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,887
- for the homosexual!
- No room!

140
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:12,601
- No room for the drug abusers!
- Oh no, no room!

141
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,979
Amen! Peanut butter
and white bread!

142
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,940
There's no room
for the college graduate!

143
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,276
No room for people
who watch public television!

144
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,446
- No room for commitment!
- Amen!

145
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,951
Come on.

146
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

147
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,643
Here it is.

148
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,397
I wonder how it
got in here.

149
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,400
Not me.

150
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,408
Okay now,
it looks like...

151
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,785
this one goes goes
to Grand Island,

152
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,704
and this one cuts
up to the highway.

153
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,127
Where's this Gatlin
we've been seeing signs for?

154
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,963
It's not on here.

155
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,424
What do you mean?
It's gotta be on here somewhere.

156
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,675
Burt, look out!

157
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,022
Hang on.

158
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,275
Let me check.
Let me check.

159
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,487
- Where, right there?
- Yeah.

160
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,865
It's just a bump.

161
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,575
Just try and relax.

162
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,664
That was an animal, right?

163
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,875
I got to go
back there, okay?

164
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,543
Just stay here
and try and rest.

165
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,267
Come on, buddy.

166
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,896
Oh lord.

167
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,111
Is... he...

168
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,947
Oh, yeah.

169
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,040
- Oh my God!
- Easy, easy, easy. Come on.

170
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,251
Easy.

171
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,837
Take it easy.
Don't look at him.

172
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,469
Okay, now,
listen to me.

173
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,805
There's something
very wrong here.

174
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,433
So I want you to go back to the car
and wait for me there,

175
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,643
Understand? Keep all the doors
locked until I get back.

176
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,396
- Why? Where are you going?
- I'll tell you when I get back.

177
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,773
- Just do what I say.
- Okay.

178
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Burt?

179
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,312
Burt?!

180
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,084
I'm so sorry.

181
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,756
- Vicky, come on.
- Burt!

182
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,716
- Easy, calm down.
- I kneeled-

183
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,135
I kneeled down next to him.
He said...

184
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,180
It's okay.
Take it easy.

185
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,265
Just take it easy.
Relax.

186
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,185
You're okay.
You understand?

187
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,521
- Yeah.
- You're okay.

188
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,399
It's okay.
Everything's okay.

189
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,987
You're okay.

190
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,406
Me and Sarah were playing
in our old house.

191
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,157
We played there lots.

192
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,368
Malachai said
it was forbidden.

193
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,287
But I think that was 'cause
nobody ever asked him to play.

194
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,124
When I grow up,

195
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,836
I'm gonna have all
the money in the world.

196
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,254
Me too.

197
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,756
- You can't.
- Why not?

198
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,260
- Because I'm gonna have it.
- I'll get it first.

199
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,720
- Will not.
- Will too!

200
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,179
- Will not!
- Will too!

201
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,597
Oh yeah, how?

202
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's easy.

203
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,777
Seven.

204
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:47,073
One, two, three,
four, five,

205
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,117
six...

206
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,952
seven.

207
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,454
All right, see?

208
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,707
$200.

209
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,834
Uh-uh, Joby.

210
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,717
How much?

211
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,137
13 thousand
hundred dollars.

212
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,639
13 thousand
hundred dollars?

213
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,726
Uh, okay,
$2,000.

214
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,312
Mm-hmm.
I thought so.

215
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,357
100, 200-

216
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,234
I got a great idea.

217
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,863
Let's pretend
this guy is Isaac.

218
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,782
And we're gonna
put him in jail.

219
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:32,160
What if he gets
a get-out-of-jail-free card?

220
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,162
Simple as that.

221
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,372
What cards?

222
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,311
Do you think it might have been
some kind of accident,

223
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,063
like farm equipment
or something?

224
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,564
Not a wound
like that.

225
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,401
His throat was cut
deliberately.

226
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,865
He was already dead
when he stumbled out into the road.

227
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,536
Whoever killed him-
do you think he saw us?

228
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,081
I mean, I felt like
we were being watched.

229
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,749
It's possible.

230
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,544
Blood starts to coagulate
in four minutes.

231
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,463
When I went to get the suitcase,
it was still fresh.

232
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,385
- Then he could have been out there.
- I couldn't leave it there.

233
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,470
I mean, what if it
holds some sort of clue?

234
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,560
- Let's open it.
- No.

235
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:42,355
Let's just get to a phone
or a house or someplace.

236
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,610
Malachai took us
right to Isaac.

237
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,863
I figured he finally
talked the little squirt

238
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,990
into punishing us
for being unbelievers.

239
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:55,076
Up till then, we'd been forgiven
'cause we weren't in the corn

240
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,996
the day He Who Walks Behind the Rows
made himself known.

241
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,248
That bothered Malachai.

242
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,833
He had a lot of problems.

243
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,386
I found these two
in one of the old homes.

244
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,598
They had a game and music.

245
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,727
And this.

246
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,857
They come already.

247
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,325
You have the gift of sight.

248
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,244
This is a blessing, my child.

249
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,413
I've seen this car
upon the road.

250
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,040
Go to the old man.

251
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,709
Make sure
he tells them nothing.

252
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,169
What about these two?

253
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,761
Take them back
where they were.

254
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,554
But they had a game
and music.

255
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,641
- They're forbidden!
- Question me not, Malachai.

256
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,143
I act according
to His will.

257
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,080
Ugh, you'd think
we were on the damn moon.

258
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,539
We haven't even
seen a truck.

259
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,083
We'll be
in Gatlin soon.

260
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,588
You think
he lived there?

261
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,132
We may never
know that.

262
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,511
I really think
we should open it.

263
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,848
Okay.

264
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,859
Let's see if I
can get some news.

265
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,987
Atone!

266
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:57,615
Only by the blood
of the Lamb are we saved!

267
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,951
I'm getting tired
of that crap!

268
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,251
- Ugh!
- What is it?

269
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,550
- Jesus Christ.
- Not in my book.

270
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,554
Looks like some kind
of primitive folk art.

271
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,431
I think it's repulsive.

272
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,814
Sarge, how about that number six?

273
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,365
Oh damn it.
Better make it an eight.

274
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,079
Come on, come on.
We ain't got all day.

275
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,756
Oh, good boy, Sarge,

276
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,633
We'll have that transmission
fixed in no time!

277
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,345
Then we'll get on
the radiator.

278
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,724
Damn, this road
is becoming a regular highway.

279
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,186
Ain't this about the third car
in a month, huh?

280
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,105
We know what to do,
don't we, boy?

281
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,368
You'd better put
that suitcase away.

282
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,873
Be right back.

283
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,756
- Hi, we've had ourselves-
- I ain't got no gas.

284
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,759
- No, I don't need gas.
- I ain't got no diesel if you all need it.

285
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,886
No, you don't understand.
I need to use your-

286
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,055
You don't buy no gas,
you can't use no restroom.

287
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,476
Your telephone.
I need to use your phone.

288
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,353
Telephone?!
I ain't got no telephone.

289
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,896
Sarge.

290
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,901
Sarge, you be still now.

291
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,535
Mister,

292
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,329
what you want to do
is to go to Hemingford.

293
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,833
- About 19 miles down that right fork there.
- What about Gatlin?

294
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,585
Gatlin? There ain't
nothin' in Gatlin.

295
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,507
What do you mean
there ain't nothing in Gatlin?

296
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,801
Folks in Gatlin's
got religion.

297
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:26,013
They don't cotton to outsiders and
probably won't have a phone either.

298
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,600
Sarge! Mister, I'd like to stay here
and shoot the breeze with you

299
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,854
about politics and stuff,
but I got a transmission to fix.

300
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,898
You get on that right fork there
and you'll be in Hemingford in no time.

301
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,650
Right.

302
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,193
Sarge.

303
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,487
I said at ease!

304
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,448
Yeah, thanks a lot.

305
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,994
Sarge!

306
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:53,082
Either that man's senile or he's been
out in the sun too long.

307
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,418
Sarge!

308
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,171
Come back here!

309
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,173
Sarge, get back here!

310
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,175
I don't have time for this.

311
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,930
You hear me?
Come back here.

312
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:11,642
Come on.
That's an order!

313
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Who is it?
Is that you?
What do you want?

314
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,428
What are you
doing in there?

315
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,783
There really isn't that much stuff in here.
Just kid's stuff-

316
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,954
clothes, matches,
compass, pocket knife.

317
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,874
- I don't get it, camping stuff?
- Yeah.

318
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,629
Oh great.
This must be our day.

319
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,674
Didn't the last sign
we saw say Gatlin was three miles

320
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,968
- and point that way?
- That's what I thought.

321
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,303
Did I miss a turn?

322
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,180
No, we've been
going straight.

323
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,309
Somebody's been messing
with these signs then.

324
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:39,272
- Hemingford's gotta be straight ahead.
- Yeah.

325
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,573
Must have been
the wind.

326
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,854
Those latches
ain't worth a damn.

327
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,523
Blow over in a bad fart.

328
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,038
I never told them nothing.

329
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,459
I swear it.
I kept our bargain just like always.

330
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,798
Jesus Christ.

331
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,551
Gatlin! What do they have a monopoly
on road signs?

332
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,762
What about Hemingford?

333
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:56,432
For people who don't like visitors,
they sure do advertise enough.

334
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,479
Over there.

335
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,444
Of course,
it's the wind.

336
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:42,395
Why did you have
to go after them, Sarge?

337
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,991
Why you bastards.

338
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,327
You can't do this to me.

339
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,940
I know you're in here.

340
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,614
Come on.

341
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,076
Come on!

342
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,174
I can smell you,
you stinkin' little skunks.

343
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,593
Come on!

344
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,436
You murdering
little devils.

345
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,398
Come on!

346
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,007
What was that?

347
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,301
That probably was just my golf bag.

348
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,137
- Are you sure?
- What do you mean am I sure?

349
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,998
God, this isn't
even a road.

350
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,501
- We're never gonna get out of here.
- We will too, now stop it!

351
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,005
Sorry.

352
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:20,344
- Just tell me where we are.
- I don't know.

353
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,943
We're right back
where we started from.

354
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,696
We never should have
listened to that old fool.

355
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,950
Hemingford's 19 miles.
Gatlin's only three.

356
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,702
I don't care how much religion
they've got,

357
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:45,870
we're going there
right now.

358
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,124
Don't ever show up
in my emergency room, buddy.

359
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,270
Behold.

360
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,148
A dream did come to me in
the night.

361
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,902
And the Lord did show
all this to me.

362
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,779
Praise God!
Praise the Lord!

363
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,574
A time of tribulation
has come.

364
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,577
A test is at hand.

365
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:31,874
- The final test.
- What has the Lord commanded?

366
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,836
In the dream,
the Lord did come to me

367
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,630
And He was a shape.

368
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,424
It was He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

369
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,844
And I did fall
on my knees in terror,

370
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,471
and hide my eyes,

371
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,182
lest the fierceness of
His face strike me dead!

372
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,352
And He told me all
that has since happened.

373
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,229
He said,

374
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,608
"Joseph has taken his things
and fled this happy place,

375
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,445
because the worship
of Me is no more upon him.

376
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:06,533
So take you his life
and spill his blood."

377
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,869
- He did?
- Yeah.

378
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:12,206
"But let not the flesh
pollute the corn.

379
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,668
- Cast him instead upon the road."
- And so it was done!

380
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:18,796
Joseph the betrayer
was cast out.

381
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,216
And He Who Walks
Behind the Rows did say,

382
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,511
"I will send
outlanders amongst you,

383
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,138
a man and a woman.

384
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,225
And these outlanders
will be unbelievers

385
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,685
and profaners
of the holy."

386
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,396
I wish Isaac
never came here.

387
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,814
But he's always been here,

388
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,733
just like He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

389
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,152
"And the man shall
sorely test you.

390
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,363
For he has great power,

391
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,157
Even greater than
that of the blue man!"

392
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,995
The blue man.
Yes, the blue man.

393
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,748
And just as the blue man
was offered up unto Him,

394
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,002
so shall be the unbelievers.

395
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,045
Make sacrifice unto Him.

396
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,298
Bring Him the blood
of the outlanders.

397
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,718
Praise God! Praise the Lord!

398
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,512
Praise God!
Praise the Lord!

399
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,432
Praise God! Praise the Lord!

400
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,101
Praise God!
Praise the Lord!

401
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,770
Praise God! Praise the Lord!

402
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,522
Let's get out of here.

403
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,941
It looks like
a swinging place.

404
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,417
I guess nobody told them
we were coming.

405
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,670
I hope not.

406
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,132
God, I don't see anybody.

407
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,681
Town hall.

408
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,309
Grocery store.

409
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,938
Hansen's Cafe.
Let's see if they've got a phone, huh?

410
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,525
Unless a ghost is using it.

411
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,930
What is it
with this corn?

412
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,224
You got me.

413
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,812
Phew.

414
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,831
It's dead.

415
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,583
Just like everything else
around here.

416
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,251
Yuck!

417
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,546
- A rat.
- Yeah.

418
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,382
Just your ordinary
coffee shop rat.

419
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,343
Now can we get
out of here, please?

420
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,513
Hey.

421
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:59,016
Hey hey, wait a minute.
Come back here!

422
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,727
Come on, Vicky.
Hurry up, I don't want to lose them.

423
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,910
So what are you
gonna do if you catch them?

424
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,745
Ask them where
we could find help, what else?

425
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,248
- They cut off that way.
- Okay.

426
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,711
Damn it. Where'd they go?

427
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,132
Look, we're already
in the car.

428
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:35,135
Why don't we go on to Hemingford?
It'll take us 20 minutes.

429
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,637
We just found people.

430
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,640
Yeah, three kids who tried
to steal our car.

431
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,186
There's something
very strange about this town.

432
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,565
Maybe you're right.

433
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,611
We'd be better off
in a bigger town anyway.

434
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:56,573
- The size of Seattle.
- Yeah.

435
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,876
- Over there.
- What?

436
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:10,754
I just saw a door
open and close.

437
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,048
I didn't see anything.

438
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,676
Let's check it out.

439
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,761
Why? I thought
we were going!

440
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,554
Settle down.
Jeez.

441
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,307
- Don't patronize me, Burt.
- I'm not patronizing you.

442
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,643
I just want to see
if somebody's there.

443
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:42,452
Hello?

444
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,749
Anybody home?

445
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:53,213
We've had an accident and we need
to use your phone.

446
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,218
Okay?
Now can we go?

447
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,892
Burt, this is
somebody's house!

448
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,519
I know, I just want
to use their phone.

449
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,521
Hello?

450
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,052
Gross.

451
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,222
I'm going to check
out back.

452
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
I found the phone.
It matches the decor perfectly.
This is three years old.

453
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,667
I don't understand
what's going on here.

454
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,463
Well, can we go?

455
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,931
Burt.

456
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,118
Hello?

457
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,711
Is anybody here?

458
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:22,547
Don't be afraid.
We didn't mean to scare you.

459
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,841
Hi.

460
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,931
- What's your name?
- Sarah.

461
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,476
Oh, Sarah.
That's a beautiful name.

462
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,103
This is Burt
and I'm Vicky.

463
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,647
Are you here alone, Sarah?

464
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,692
Do you live here?

465
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,155
You just come here
to play?

466
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:51,785
Are your mommy
and daddy around?

467
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,205
They're in the cornfield.

468
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,748
What are they
doing there?

469
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,917
All the grown-ups
are there.

470
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,671
Are they working there
or are they having a meeting?

471
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,758
No, Isaac put
them there.

472
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,260
Who's Isaac?

473
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,015
Come on, sweetheart.
Tell us who Isaac is.

474
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,017
Our leader.

475
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:17,602
Leader of what?

476
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,273
Of everybody.

477
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,650
Of course.

478
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,283
Listen, could you
take us to Isaac?

479
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,785
- Huh-uh.
- Why not?

480
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,203
He's scary.

481
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:37,789
Look, Sarah,
it's very important

482
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,292
that we speak to some
grown-ups as soon as possible.

483
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,043
We're wasting
our time here, Vicky.

484
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:43,920
Well, give her a chance.

485
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,964
I'm gonna go look
at the town hall.

486
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,883
Why?

487
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,803
Because we have
a murder to report.

488
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,973
And we're standing here
talking in circles wasting our time.

489
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,808
Maybe she can help.

490
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,727
Well, fine, then you
stay here with her.

491
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,608
Listen, things just
aren't happening fast enough.

492
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,943
So I'm gonna
leave you the car.

493
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,403
I won't be gone very long.

494
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,156
If anybody comes,
just honk, okay?

495
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:17,287
Are we safe?

496
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,583
Yeah, it's a little weird
here, but it's safe.

497
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,210
I'll be back.

498
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,981
So looks like
it's just you and me.

499
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:50,153
What were you doing here by yourself?
Just playing records?

500
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,616
Come on, you can tell me.

501
00:49:57,453 --> 00:50:00,121
- Drawing
- Drawing.

502
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,916
What's so secret
about drawing?

503
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,210
I'm not supposed to.

504
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,170
You're not supposed
to draw?

505
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,299
Who says?
Isaac?

506
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,259
Malachai.

507
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,345
Malachai?

508
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:17,639
Well, I'll tell you what.

509
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,015
Why don't you draw me
a picture

510
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,768
And we won't tell Isaac
or Malachai or anybody?

511
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,354
- How's that sound?
- Okay.

512
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:46,472
- So how's it coming, huh?
- Fine.

513
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,393
- What did you draw?
- You.

514
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,479
You did?
Could I see?

515
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,033
What is this?

516
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,995
Burt?

517
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:39,734
Burt, is that you?

518
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,322
Is somebody here?

519
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:50,203
Who are you?

520
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:53,498
What do you want?

521
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:59,963
We want
to give you peace.

522
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,967
Seize her.

523
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,635
Come on, get her.

524
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,107
Come out of there.

525
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:24,278
Sarah!

526
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:43,798
No!

527
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,342
No!

528
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,597
Burt! No!

529
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,604
Are we safe?

530
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:01,274
It's weird here, but it's safe.

531
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:06,029
Vicky.

532
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Help me!
Where are you
taking me?
Burt!

533
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:25,715
Burt! No!

534
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,605
Vicky!

535
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,946
Sarah, what
happened here, huh?

536
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:52,325
What happened?
Where's Vicky?

537
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,660
You've gotta think.
Now think.

538
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,245
What happened
to her, please?

539
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,919
Does He speak
to you, Isaac?

540
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:06,089
He speaks to me always.

541
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,341
But today He is
displeased.

542
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:12,011
He is displeased
with you, Malachai.

543
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,846
What have I done?

544
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,099
Question Him not in vain.

545
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:19,060
Do you not know you did sacrificed
Joseph without an offering?

546
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:22,188
And did you not
spill the blood of the old man

547
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,774
when his oil and gasoline were
still useful to us?

548
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,193
We have our own
fuel now from the corn.

549
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,863
Show not your pride, Malachai.
We have not enough.

550
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:37,036
Maybe He is displeased
we have not offered Him Sarah and Job.

551
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,789
Sarah has the gift of sight.

552
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,543
She warned us of the coming
of the interlopers.

553
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:46,212
Question not my judgment,
Malachai.

554
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,840
I am the giver
of His word.

555
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,886
Go you and bring me
the husband.

556
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,514
I must offer them tonight
when Amos leaves.

557
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:03,437
Sarah, come on.
Tell me what happened to her, please.

558
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,316
Sarah, look at me.
Now think.

559
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,152
- Malachai.
- What?

560
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:12,530
- Malachai.
- Who's Malachai? What do you mean?

561
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,127
No.

562
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:47,356
Vicky?

563
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,328
Oh my God!

564
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,457
Kill kill kill kill...

565
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:50,521
Now the blood
of Amos will be shared!

566
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,232
Stop it!
Stop that!

567
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:55,651
- What?
- Hold the outlander!

568
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,659
What the hell's
going on here?

569
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,704
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?

570
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,206
My passage,
it's my birthday.

571
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:12,084
You got a pretty sick way
of celebrating it, pal.

572
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,212
- Listen, I-
- Silence, interloper!

573
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:18,966
Your presence does
profane this holy place.

574
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,968
He will reckon with you!

575
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:22,928
That's terrific.
I don't know who he is,

576
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,848
but maybe he'd like to discuss the medical
side of what's going on here with me.

577
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,016
- It's as it should be.
- Amos!

578
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,517
It's as it is written.

579
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:29,894
Speak no more to him!

580
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:33,606
He is an unbeliever.
Hurry, get Isaac.

581
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,108
No, wait.

582
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,444
Bring Malachai.

583
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:46,702
So what do you mean,
"as it is written"? Written where?

584
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:54,460
What, in this?

585
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,838
You rewriting the whole thing orjust
the parts that suit your needs?

586
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:06,889
Back off, fellas.

587
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,224
Sit down!

588
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:12,061
What do we have here?

589
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:15,981
19, 19 year-
what is this?

590
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,025
These people
all died so young.

591
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,444
Not die. We go to Him

592
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:22,405
- on the first night of our 19th year.
- YEAH!

593
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:24,031
Who the hell's him?

594
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:25,699
He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

595
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,701
Malachai comes!

596
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:33,207
- Seize him!
- Get him!

597
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,501
Back off!

598
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,880
Stay back.

599
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:43,259
No!

600
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:46,137
Come on, hurry up.

601
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:58,274
Get him. Do not
let him escape!

602
01:02:58,358 --> 01:02:59,775
Get him!
Kill him!

603
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,161
- Let's go. Get him!
- Where is he? Come on!

604
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,412
He went
around the corner!

605
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:16,459
There he is.
Go get him, you guys. Go that way.

606
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,426
He's getting away!

607
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,105
I need your help.
Come on.

608
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:41,066
Come on!
Help me, help me!

609
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,527
Outlander!
Hey!

610
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:45,571
- He's here.
- There he is.

611
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,655
Come on.

612
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,242
Get him.

613
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:02,046
- Got you this time.
- This isn't a game, understand?

614
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,841
Back off.
Get out of here.

615
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:12,223
Outlander!

616
01:04:13,225 --> 01:04:14,892
Go get him!

617
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,607
Down the alley.

618
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:29,865
Damn it!

619
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,453
Check the door.
Check the doors.

620
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:42,461
You guys,
go back up the alley.

621
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:44,713
You, over there.
You two, follow me.

622
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,105
Shit.

623
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,661
Damn it.

624
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:19,683
Psst.
Hey, mister.

625
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:22,645
I know a place
to hide.

626
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,063
But we gotta hurry.

627
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,065
- Who are you?
- Job.

628
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,609
Come on.
Stop asking questions.

629
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:35,991
Come on.

630
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,954
Will you come on?

631
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,388
Careful.

632
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:59,973
Hey, don't be
a scaredy cat.

633
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:05,104
- Come on. It's only me and Sarah.
- Sarah?

634
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,439
Yeah, my sister.

635
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,779
Isn't this neat?
My dad built it

636
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,490
for when the communists
launch their first strike.

637
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:21,036
I don't think it's the communists
we have to worry about.

638
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:24,331
Don't worry.
Nobody knows about this place.

639
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,334
It's secret.

640
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:29,837
- Are those guys friends of yours?
- No way.

641
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,548
They listen to Isaac
and Malachai.

642
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,967
Who are Isaac
and Malachai?

643
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,094
Isaac started
the whole thing.

644
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,972
If he hadn't had come,
this would never have happened.

645
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:43,100
When he was young, he was a preacher,
so everybody believed him.

646
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,811
They thought he had
great spirit.

647
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,313
I thought he was weird,
huh, Sarah?

648
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:01,785
We must sacrifice
them both tonight.

649
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,496
Amos will satisfy Him.
We need the woman.

650
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:05,748
She'll bring the man to us.

651
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,876
No, he must be
taken without her.

652
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,920
We cannot remove her
from this place. It is holy.

653
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,298
We will bring the Lord
two by using one.

654
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:16,508
Do not blaspheme,
Malachai!

655
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:19,636
You know not the laws.
He speaks them only to me.

656
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:22,973
I think not, Isaac.
You're the one who's lost favor with Him.

657
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:26,435
He's the god of blood and sacrifice,
not ceremony.

658
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:29,313
Ah, sacrilege!
Down on your knees, heretic!

659
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:30,939
Shut your mouth, Isaac.

660
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:33,025
You've grown prideful
and apart from us.

661
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,569
Oh my gosh. Oh no.

662
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,197
He Who Walks Behind the Rows
will decide your fate.

663
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:41,575
Don't just sit there.
Seize him!

664
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,077
Punish him!
Cut him down! I command you!

665
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,872
I am the word and the giver
of His laws.

666
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,208
Disobedience to me
is disobedience to Him.

667
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:52,878
Do it now or your punishment shall be
a thousand times a thousand deaths.

668
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,713
Each more horrible
than the last.

669
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,715
They are tired
of your talk, Isaac.

670
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,258
I have shown them
what I can do.

671
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:00,552
Cut the woman down.

672
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,387
Put Isaac in her place.

673
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,890
You will see how
the Lord favors you.

674
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,059
No, you dare not.
You blaspheme.

675
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,520
He will punish you.
The god of hell will devour you.

676
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:12,689
All of you! No!

677
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,362
When my dad
wouldn't get up,

678
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:21,365
I ran from Hansen's
to get Officer Hotchkiss.

679
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,742
But I was too late.

680
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,744
Why, what happened to him?

681
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,704
He got away...
that time.

682
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:30,916
Then he went down to the barn
after he talked to the minister.

683
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,961
The minister?
What happened to the minister?

684
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:35,295
Malachai.

685
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:41,134
Outlander!

686
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,513
Outlander!

687
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:48,517
Get over there.
He's gonna come. Get over there.

688
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:52,855
- You come with me down this street.
- Outlander!

689
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:57,276
Outlander!

690
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,530
We have your woman.
She still lives.

691
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:06,201
Outlander, maybe you don't
hear so well.

692
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:08,704
Burt!

693
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:12,165
Outlander,
her blood will spill

694
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,251
unless you give
yourself up.

695
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:17,129
We won't wait
much longer.

696
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:21,174
Night is coming.
Night is His time.

697
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,427
Outlander!

698
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,095
Come on!
Come on!

699
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,472
Come on, outlander!

700
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,058
Come on!

701
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,603
Outlander!

702
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:38,942
Are you looking
for that lady?

703
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:40,611
Yeah, you know
where she is?

704
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:43,739
- They took her out to the clearing.
- What clearing? Where?

705
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,824
In the cornfield.

706
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:48,452
- Are you sure?
- Of course, I'm sure.

707
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,871
- I followed them like I followed you.
- Show me.

708
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,709
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

709
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:56,835
Okay.

710
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,383
Quiet.

711
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,430
Come on.

712
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,184
Follow me to the barn.

713
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:14,478
Careful.

714
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:30,369
I'm ready to celebrate
my birthday.

715
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,621
Malachai, He will not forgive you!

716
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,790
None of you
will be forgiven!

717
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,708
All of you
shall feel His wrath!

718
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,877
We have a surprise for you, Amos.

719
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:41,338
You morons. Don't you understand
what he's trying to do?

720
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,298
Isaac's going
to keep you company.

721
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:45,425
He Who Walks Behind the Rows
will decide your fate.

722
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,220
I am the word and the giver
of His laws!

723
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,847
This is the end!

724
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:19,584
Come on.

725
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,841
Come in through here.

726
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,804
You can see
everything from here.

727
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:40,897
Okay, you two.

728
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,443
You stay here
and wait for me, all right?

729
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,153
But if anything
happens to me,

730
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:49,281
you get to Hemingford
as fast as you can.

731
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,576
You get on that road
and don't get off, understand?

732
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,212
Go past
the irrigation pump.

733
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:44,044
It's him.

734
01:13:47,507 --> 01:13:52,302
He's come for me.

735
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:56,556
He's come
to welcome me.

736
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:05,732
Go to him, Amos!

737
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:12,405
I'm here, Lord!

738
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:15,534
I'm ready.

739
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:18,286
Take me now, Lord.

740
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,374
Your will, Lord.

741
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,626
Thy message.

742
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,728
I did as You commanded.

743
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,730
I was good.

744
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,401
I swear it.

745
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:53,280
I did everything
You wanted.

746
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:07,085
No!

747
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:20,098
It's the outlander!

748
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,267
Come on, go.
Run to the barn.

749
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,603
Get him!

750
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,772
Get him!

751
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,441
Help Malachai!

752
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,527
- Get him.
- He came back.

753
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:36,031
Vicky, get out of here.

754
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:38,575
Was this how it was
with your parents, huh?

755
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:39,784
Was it?

756
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:43,538
Just because some
self-proclaimed holy man

757
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:46,041
said this is what
God commands?

758
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,627
So?

759
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:51,796
What kind of a god tells his children
to kill their parents, huh?

760
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:53,089
Answer me that, buddy.

761
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,550
Did you ever hear
of that before Isaac?

762
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:56,968
Did you?

763
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:01,056
I can't believe
you're this blind.

764
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:07,020
Maybe you've been listening to these
holy rollers so long,

765
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:10,649
it's all starting to sound the same.
Well, it's not!

766
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,318
- What's he talking about?
- Any religion...

767
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,528
without love
and compassion...

768
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:17,405
is false!

769
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:20,408
It's a lie!

770
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,699
Did he kill Malachai?

771
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:07,539
Is this what
you want, huh?

772
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,624
Is this what He
commands?

773
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:21,720
I don't think so.

774
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:23,179
Get him.

775
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:26,850
Stop him.

776
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,268
Get him.

777
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,772
Malachai!

778
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:36,568
Oh my God! Isaac!

779
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,405
He wants you too...

780
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,240
Malachai!

781
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:49,080
He wants you too.

782
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:15,440
Use these!

783
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:18,651
Should we board this up?

784
01:18:27,787 --> 01:18:29,871
- Vicky?
- Burt?

785
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,499
Over here.
You're hurt.

786
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:35,919
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

787
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:39,714
Get down.
Get down.

788
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:43,301
Joby, get some help
and get those doors closed, quick.

789
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:45,804
- Peter, Robert, come on.
- What do we do?

790
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:47,305
I don't know.

791
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,265
If I knew what it was,
I could tell you.

792
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,352
It's He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

793
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,979
What if we tried to run for it
and make it to the road?

794
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,565
I think we're
safer here for now.

795
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,658
Joby, has anybody
ever tried to hurt the monster?

796
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,660
Any of the adults?
The parents before they were killed?

797
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,078
The blue man.

798
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:12,247
Who's the blue man?
What did he do?

799
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:14,666
Officer Hotchkiss.
I told you.

800
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,585
He came down here after
he talked to the minister.

801
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,171
He was reading a page
torn out of the Bible

802
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:22,424
- and he was working with the still.
- Wait a minute.

803
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:27,971
Why was he reading out of the Bible?
What was it?

804
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:30,515
Do you know?
You have it?

805
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:32,684
Hurry up.
Where is it?

806
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,020
It's all Malachai's fault!

807
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,022
"And the devil
that deceived them

808
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,442
was cast into the lake of fire
and brimstone

809
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:44,612
where the beast and the false prophet
are and shall be tormented

810
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:47,115
day and night
forever and ever."

811
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,450
What's that
supposed to mean?

812
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:57,375
Job, what was
the blue man doing at the still?

813
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:01,087
He hooked the hose up
to it and was trying to roll it out.

814
01:20:01,172 --> 01:20:04,382
- What stopped him?
- Malachai.

815
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:08,344
"Lake of fire." Fire!
He was going to burn the field.

816
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:12,182
Oh, yes.
The gasohol. The still.

817
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:14,142
- How?
- Never mind, never mind.

818
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:17,312
You kids, get me as many hoses
as you can find, quick!

819
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,399
Job and Sarah,
find me a bottle, a glass one.

820
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:23,526
A pop bottle.
Quick, move.

821
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:25,403
Vicky, come here.

822
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:29,365
- Over here.
- I can't find anything.

823
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,998
It doesn't fit.

824
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,501
There's gotta be a connector
around here somewhere.

825
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,545
Try these.

826
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,310
Get somebody
to hold this on tight.

827
01:20:57,394 --> 01:21:00,271
- Okay!
- Hang on to it.

828
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:02,232
You got one, good.

829
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,946
Vicky, see if you can find me
a thick rag.

830
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,781
Joby, come here.

831
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,867
Hey, that's not a rag.

832
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:17,539
Sheesh.

833
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,166
Okay.

834
01:21:20,251 --> 01:21:23,503
Now get them to hold
onto that tight.

835
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:26,256
- Open it up when I get out there, all right?
- All right.

836
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,509
Burt, be careful.

837
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:33,054
- I love you, Vicky.
- I wish we'd never done this.

838
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:35,139
Okay.

839
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:35,533
What are you doing here?
Get back to the barn. Hurry up.

840
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:39,120
Go on, move. Now.

841
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,294
Excuse me.

842
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:08,775
Joby, get that valve.

843
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:11,027
Quick.

844
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:22,830
Joby, do you know how
to run this thing?

845
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:25,041
- Crank it.
- What?

846
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,376
Crank it.

847
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:37,679
Push the button
at the top.

848
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:39,889
Yeah.

849
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,520
All right.

850
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,289
- Get the bottle.
- Okay.

851
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:24,434
Come here.
Block the wind.

852
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

853
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:43,661
Joby! Joby!
Come back here.

854
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:45,079
You'll get killed.

855
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:55,715
Joby!

856
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:06,476
Run. Come on.
Run, Joby.

857
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:09,520
Here's the bottle!

858
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:12,815
Throw it.
Throw right this time.

859
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:16,486
Throw it.
Throw it.

860
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:39,467
Burt!

861
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:47,975
- Joby!
- Burt!

862
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,019
Joby!

863
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,481
- Vicky! Vicky!
- Sarah!

864
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,400
Joby!

865
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:57,902
Joby!

866
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:06,202
Look! Look!

867
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:21,509
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

868
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:37,233
- Is He dead?
- I think so.

869
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:41,404
- Then why are we still running?
- Just keep going.

870
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:43,656
Where did you get this guy?

871
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:16,981
Well, Hemingford's 19 miles, right?

872
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:20,651
You mean walk?

873
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,069
Sure.

874
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:24,071
Burt, are you sure
you're strong enough?

875
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:26,073
I'm okay.

876
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:28,117
What about you?
Are you okay?

877
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:30,703
Yeah, I'll make it.

878
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:32,580
I got a great doctor.

879
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,416
You better believe it.

880
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:45,635
Jealous?

881
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:47,803
What are we gonna do
with these two little munchkins, huh?

882
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:49,263
Oh, I don't know.

883
01:27:49,348 --> 01:27:51,766
You guys want to come live with us
for a couple days?

884
01:27:53,727 --> 01:27:55,353
- Hmm?
- How about a week?

885
01:27:57,814 --> 01:28:00,399
- Okay.
- How about a month?

886
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:02,526
No.

887
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,403
All right.
All right.

888
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:07,031
I'll grab the map.

889
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:09,283
- Ever been to Seattle?
- What's Seattle?

890
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:17,917
Interloper!

891
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:19,168
No!

892
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:24,966
You must die.

893
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:28,135
Oh, boy.

894
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:34,642
Oh, she's out cold.

895
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:37,687
What are we
gonna do now?

896
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:39,689
Send her a get-well
card from Seattle.

897
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:41,440
Let's get the hell
out of here.
