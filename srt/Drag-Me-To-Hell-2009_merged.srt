00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,300
No! No!

3
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,307
No!

4
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,721
Juan!

5
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,057
Juan!

6
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:44,910
<i>Repeat the following phrases
precisely as spoken.</i>

7
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,980
<i>There is no friction with the proper diction.</i>

8
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,017
There is no friction
with the proper diction.

9
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,920
<i>Good sounds abound
when the mouth is round.</i>

10
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,152
Good sounds abound
when the mouth is round.

11
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,988
Round. Round.

12
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,348
I think we can make this work.
I'll call you this afternoon and let you know.

13
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,514
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

14
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,558
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

15
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,221
- Thank you.
- Have a great day.

16
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,886
- Yeah, you, too. Have a good day.
- Okay.

17
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,623
- Thank you.
- Bye.

18
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,467
- Here you go, Mr Jacks.
- Thank you.

19
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,907
Mr Jacks?

20
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:02,151
I was wondering if you'd made any decision
regarding the assistant manager's position.

21
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,753
Well, I'm still deciding, and right now,
it's between Stu and yourself.

22
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,088
Stu Rubin, the new guy?

23
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,961
Well, I know he's new, but he's also
quite aggressive, and we like that.

24
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,659
You know, Stu's someone who's
not afraid to crunch the numbers

25
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,599
and make the tough decisions.

26
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,264
I'm perfectly capable of
making the tough decisions.

27
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,672
I'll let you know as soon as I decide. Okay?

28
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,978
In the meantime, take him through
our loan qualifying procedures,

29
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,513
just in case, all right?

30
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,343
Okay.

31
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,677
And would you mind
taking your lunch break now?

32
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,846
Sure.

33
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,119
And maybe on your way back,
you could pick me up a turkey club?

34
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:44,095
Turkey club, excellent choice!
You mind picking one up for me? Thanks.

35
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,123
And spicy mustard.

36
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,001
- What have you got?
- Could I get your approval on this?

37
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,831
- This is the loan we talked about before.
- The loan.

38
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,131
Exactly.

39
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,334
- Good one, huh?
- One-point-five?

40
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,499
Absolutely, and it'll be one of many.

41
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,447
Well, Professor, congratulations
on making it through your first week.

42
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,713
Thank you very much. Mmm.

43
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,553
- I thought you'd have a full beard by now.
- So did I. I'm a little disappointed.

44
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,056
Man, this thing. That's it. I'm done. I'm out.

45
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,893
Chris, don't even bother.

46
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,195
I gotta get a new one.

47
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,792
I'm telling you, you're gonna
drive yourself nuts. It's completely

48
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,735
broken.

49
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:34,572
- Was broken.
- You are cocky and sexy and unbelievable.

50
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,312
I almost forgot. Found it at the bank.

51
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,643
What is this?

52
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:47,354
No way! Wow. It's a 1929 Standing Liberty,
and it's almost fully struck.

53
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,222
You found this in
regular circulation at the bank?

54
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,387
I did.

55
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,694
I'm gonna add this
to my nerdy coin collection.

56
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,763
- Thank you, baby.
- Okay.

57
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,769
Thanks for thinking of me.

58
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,934
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

59
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,168
- See you later.
- I'll see you later, okay?

60
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,102
<i>- Dr Dalton.
- Hello, dear.</i>

61
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:09,779
<i>- Hi, Mom.
- What are you doing?</i>

62
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,544
Christine just came over
and brought some lunch,

63
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,178
<i>- and I'm correcting some papers.
- Christine? The one from the farm?</i>

64
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,949
Yeah, Mom, the girl I've been
dating for almost a year,

65
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,184
the girl who's coming for dinner.
We're still on for dinner?

66
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,692
<i>- I'm sure she's a very sweet girl.
- She is. I can't wait for you...</i>

67
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,286
<i>But you know your father and I
just have certain expectations for you.</i>

68
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,059
<i>- I can't really do the expectations...
- I understand Amy Kulick is looking</i>

69
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,794
<i>- for someone to play tennis with.
- Yeah, I...</i>

70
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,427
<i>You know, she graduated
from Yale Law with honours,</i>

71
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,870
<i>and she's a very successful attorney now.</i>

72
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,271
<i>- I know. You told me.
- Yeah, that's the kind of girl</i>

73
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,708
<i>- I would love to see you with.
- Mother...</i>

74
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:42,475
<i>She's the kind of woman
who could really help you socially</i>

75
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,447
<i>and, as a result, in your career.</i>

76
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,746
<i>And that's the kind of thing you
should be thinking about now.</i>

77
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,617
<i>- Mother, I don't wanna...
- You can't be playing around</i>

78
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,745
<i>with little girls off the farm.</i>

79
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,257
I think you're really gonna...
I think you're really gonna like...

80
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,587
<i>It's time to really find a partner.</i>

81
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,431
Christine, you messed up my order.

82
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,930
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, I said no mayo.

83
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,672
You never said that.

84
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,738
You know what? Don't sweat it. It's okay.

85
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,625
Mr Jacks, by the way,
aren't you a Laker fan?

86
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:33,757
I am a Laker fan.

87
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,301
My mom is having this thing on Sunday.
I can't use these.

88
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,132
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Absolutely. You want them?

89
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,535
- These are great seats!
- They are great seats.

90
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,197
This is where they
bring the hot dogs right to you.

91
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,133
Yes, it is.
You are gonna hobnob with celebs.

92
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,177
- You sure that's okay?
- Absolutely, it's okay. Yeah.

93
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,973
- Well, thank you, Stu.
- Take them. Absolutely.

94
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,638
- Wow.
- Say hey to Kobe for me.

95
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,205
Of course.

96
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,810
Will you help me?

97
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,520
Of course. What can I do for you?

98
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:03,153
Your trucks are at my house.
The men are packing all my things,

99
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,659
private things. Please, make them stop.

100
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,173
- Mrs...
- Ganush.

101
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:19,340
Mrs Ganush, the bank is informing you

102
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:23,644
of their intent to repossess your property
at 325 Brandon Street today.

103
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,810
But this is my home for 30 years.

104
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:32,020
And I make every payment
until the sickness took my eye.

105
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,159
I hope to have more money soon.
I just need a little more time. You...

106
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,596
I don't think my manager's going
to extend you any more credit.

107
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,862
Please. Won't you try?

108
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,038
- Okay.
- Bless you.

109
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,438
Bless you!

110
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,545
We have
an elderly woman asking

111
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,114
for an extension on her mortgage payment.

112
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,718
She's on a fixed income,
and she's had some medical problems.

113
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,788
There's gotta be something
we can do to help her.

114
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,873
Well, apparently,
we've already granted her two extensions.

115
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,942
And, you know, on this type of foreclosure,
we seize the trapped equity

116
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,480
and the bank makes a sizable amount in fees.

117
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,777
We would have to
throw her out of her house.

118
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,579
It's a tough decision.

119
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,252
Your call.

120
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,275
I'll take care of it.

121
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,438
Mrs Ganush. I'm sorry, Mrs Ganush,

122
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,303
but another extension on the loan
is out of the question.

123
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,866
- What?
- I would like to help, but it is in the bank's...

124
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:36,381
No, please, this is my home.
Where will I live?

125
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,447
You list your granddaughter as a reference.
Maybe you could stay with her.

126
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,145
I would not burden her.

127
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,318
And there are several fine assisted
living facilities for the elderly...

128
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:51,227
A nursing home? No, I would
never live in one of those places.

129
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,994
I'm really sorry.

130
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,523
I am proud woman, Miss Brown,

131
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,864
and never have I begged for anything.

132
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,265
But now, I beg for you.

133
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,103
- I humble myself before you.
- Mrs Ganush. Mrs Ganush, please.

134
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,869
- Please stand up.
- I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.

135
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,935
On my mother's grave, I beg you!

136
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:44,212
Please let go. Let go! Security! Stop!

137
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,052
- Over here, Billy! Over here!
- We're coming.

138
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,963
You shame me.

139
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:13,239
I beg you, and you shame me.

140
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,741
I think your business
is finished here, ma'am.

141
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,916
Let's go.

142
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Mrs Ganush...

143
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,324
Get out of here!

144
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,595
- Come on, ma'am.
- Let's go.

145
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,743
I never saw anything quite like that before.

146
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,906
Are you okay?

147
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,343
You handled that just right, you know.

148
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,929
- Good night. See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

149
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:15,269
You know, I just finished
going over this McPherson loan.

150
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,775
- This is very impressive work.
- Thanks.

151
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,312
Would you mind taking this
home tonight and finishing it up?

152
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,645
Because I would like to show it
to the regional veep in the morning.

153
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,514
- I would love to.
- Great.

154
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:27,984
Thank you.

155
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:31,546
And as far as that
assistant manager's position goes,

156
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,623
you're at the top of the list.

157
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

158
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You shamed me.

159
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

160
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,962
I beat you, you old bitch!

161
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,826
No!

162
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,789
Lamia.

163
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,307
Soon it will be you
who comes begging to me.

164
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,674
- She's right over there.
- Thank you, thank you.

165
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:34,480
Hey!

166
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,316
Once they send some officers
over to have a talk with her,

167
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:42,689
she's not gonna be
bothering you any more, okay?

168
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,251
So don't even think about her.

169
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,887
And I'm gonna call
Mr Jacks and just make sure

170
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:48,159
he can have somebody walk you
to your car every night, okay?

171
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,495
Okay.

172
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,835
I just thank God you're okay.
You are okay, right?

173
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:55,935
I'm fine.

174
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,608
What? What's the matter?

175
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:05,409
It's just that maybe I could have
gotten her another extension on her loan.

176
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,882
Chris, no, don't do that.

177
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:10,115
You said the bank granted this woman
two extensions already, right?

178
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,281
I'm sorry, if you don't pay your mortgage,
you lose your house.

179
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,053
What does this woman expect?
It's not your fault.

180
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,687
You can't beat yourself up over it.

181
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:27,401
I mean, what'd she expect?
It's not your fault.

182
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:30,636
And regardless of what you may
or may not have been able to do,

183
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,538
that's still no justification for her...

184
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,050
What is it? What's wrong?

185
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,559
- Did you hear that?
- What?

186
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,483
Really? You didn't?

187
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,657
No. What?

188
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:00,165
I know this is gonna sound weird,
but I wanna get my fortune read.

189
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,176
Now? Are you kidding?

190
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,678
Come on, Chris. I'll read your fortune for you.

191
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,173
In the near future,
we are gonna get in the car,

192
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,185
- go home and relax.
- Clay, I really want to do this.

193
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,017
Why? Because of
what happened with that old woman?

194
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,422
Chris, I really think
we should just get you home now.

195
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,787
Can you do this for me?

196
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,538
I pray to God
none of my students see me here.

197
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,273
The only class I'll be able to
teach is, like, Hypocrisy 101.

198
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,107
Yeah, there's so many things
to choose from here.

199
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:48,778
Unfortunately, not what I'm looking for,
which is a weird little dried monkey head.

200
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,048
Wait, no, never mind, he's got one.

201
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:56,058
I am Rham Jas, seer.

202
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:01,730
- I'm Christine and this is Clay.
- But you probably already knew that, right?

203
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:06,337
- Just kidding.
- How can I help you?

204
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:10,000
I would like to have my fortune read.
Can you do that?

205
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:13,135
I have the ability to see certain energies.

206
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:16,840
Sometimes these energies
are a foretoken of things to come.

207
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,177
$60, please.

208
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,013
- Seriously?
- Yes.

209
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,748
Sixty... Doesn't that seem a little
steep for this sort of thing?

210
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:28,657
- If you're not serious, please go.
- All right. Come on, Chris.

211
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:31,321
Wait, wait! I'll... I'll pay.

212
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,593
No, you know what?
You know what? I got it. I got it.

213
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:39,431
- There you go.
- Platinum card. Very good.

214
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,772
Thank you.

215
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,745
- Here, here, baby.
- Thanks.

216
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,041
Sure.

217
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:55,215
Uh-uh. Please.

218
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,110
Okay.

219
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,723
So, you wish to know
something of your destiny.

220
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:01,953
- Yes.
- Very good.

221
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,551
Let's see what the fates have in store.

222
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,893
You know, Freud said
destiny was not an act of fate,

223
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,727
but rather something
created by our subconscious

224
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,597
to control our conscious choices.

225
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:14,729
That's true. But we cannot attempt to
understand the world by intellect alone.

226
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,136
- Carl Jung.
- Yes.

227
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,870
<i>From his treatise Psychological Types.</i>

228
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:24,380
- So...
- Jung, the New Agers' favourite psychologist.

229
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,747
Because he wasn't
afraid to bring God into the equation.

230
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,116
Well, he wasn't afraid to bring God into...

231
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,621
- Clay, Clay, come on.
- Let's do it. I know. Come on. Let's start.

232
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,486
- Shall we?
- I'm ready.

233
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,252
Very well. Please, give me your hand.

234
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,988
Okay.

235
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:39,225
This way. Okay.

236
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,494
You work with money.

237
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:49,899
That's right.

238
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,609
And you've recently lost something.

239
00:26:55,781 --> 00:27:01,242
- No, I don't think so.
- No. No, you haven't lost anything.

240
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,686
But something's been taken from you.

241
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:06,751
No.

242
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,294
- A button.
- Oh, my God. Yes!

243
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,027
Well, anyone can see
she's missing a button! So what?

244
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,360
But, Clay, it was really strange.

245
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,866
The old woman today,
she took a button from my sleeve.

246
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,803
- Why would she do that?
- If you would both please just be quiet!

247
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

248
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,608
- I think that's enough for tonight.
- What's wrong?

249
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:42,244
I'm tired, and I see it's become quite late.
I will, of course, refund your money.

250
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,879
Wait, wait, wait! Did you see something?

251
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,085
A dark spirit has come upon you.

252
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,626
- What do you mean?
- Well, he's...

253
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,593
Did you blaspheme the dead
while visiting a graveyard?

254
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,756
- No!
- Did you play with a Ouija board

255
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,696
or consort with those
who practise the black arts?

256
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,098
All right, take it easy, man. Come on.

257
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,227
Wait. Clay, Clay, Clay. No. No, I didn't.

258
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,133
Perhaps someone has cursed you.

259
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:12,313
- Then how did he know all that?
- Know what? That you lost a button?

260
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,641
And by the way,
he didn't really know that much.

261
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,653
He makes a couple
of good guesses, then he...

262
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,656
He stirs you up, and then he leaves you
with all these questions

263
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,318
and, conveniently, his business card.

264
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,486
Come on, Chris, he's a scam artist.

265
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,991
But he didn't want the money.
He tried to give it back, remember?

266
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,832
Well, he sort of tried,
but in the end, he took it, didn't he?

267
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:37,331
I guess so.

268
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,595
I gotta go meet
the guy that's towing your car,

269
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:03,690
so you gonna be okay?

270
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,099
- Yeah.
- All right. Kitty, take care of her.

271
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,865
- I'll see you in about an hour. Love you.
- Okay.

272
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,200
Okay.

273
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

274
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

275
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:11,884
Damn it.

276
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

277
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,096
- Here. Put that on your lip.
- Thank you.

278
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,673
I can't believe she came to the house.
This is so nuts. I'm calling the cops.

279
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,902
- It wasn't her.
- Who was it then?

280
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:09,208
- I don't know. I couldn't see who it was.
- Of course it was her. It had to be her.

281
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,215
No, Clay, it wasn't anyone!

282
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,444
It was somebody.
Chris, it had to be somebody.

283
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,018
The lights were out.
You just couldn't see who it was,

284
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,283
- but I'm guessing it was...
- Clay, there wasn't anybody here.

285
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,853
Then who did this?

286
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,023
Who hit you in the face?

287
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,357
Huh?

288
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,370
I think it's just a reaction to
her being attacked earlier in the day.

289
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,963
Yeah.
Classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress.

290
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:40,475
Yeah, she's showing
signs of panic and paranoia. So...

291
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:43,046
- Do you want me to walk you out, man?
- No, no, no, I'll be fine.

292
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:44,479
All right.

293
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,309
Hey, hey.

294
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,117
How you doing?

295
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,383
- Better.
- Yeah?

296
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,550
Especially after
the doctor explained it to me.

297
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,594
He said that victims of violence,

298
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,130
<i>- they re-experience...
- Re-experience their trauma.</i>

299
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,899
I misinterpreted it to be
something more than it was.

300
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:08,328
- Happens.
- I just... I feel...

301
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,408
- What?
- Kind of embarrassed.

302
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:15,240
Are you kidding? No.
You never have to be embarrassed with me.

303
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,844
Okay?

304
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:28,148
Hey, listen, I was thinking maybe
we could take a little trip on Saturday,

305
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,023
- get on the train and go to Santa Barbara.
- Your folks' cabin.

306
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,527
Yeah, if you're up for it, the cabin.

307
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,928
- Oh, my God, I would love to!
- Yeah? Good.

308
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,331
- That'd be so exciting.
- Baby, you're gonna love it.

309
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,459
- You're gonna love it.
- Okay, good.

310
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,594
I'm excited for you to see it.

311
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,262
- There's trees and it's private.
- That would be great.

312
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:42,863
It'll be great. It'll be good.

313
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:48,378
I think we need to.
And we can just... We can just talk and stuff.

314
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

315
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:57,503
What?

316
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,846
- What's the matter?
- I couldn't... I couldn't wake up.

317
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:08,184
It's okay. Okay.
Come here. It was just a dream.

318
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,595
Baby, that's the rental car
they dropped off this morning.

319
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,328
- Okay? Sure.
- Thanks.

320
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,263
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

321
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:34,202
Hey, baby, try not to piss off
any old ladies today, okay?

322
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,554
Hey, Christine?

323
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,500
- What, are you just getting here?
- What are you, the hall monitor?

324
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:59,901
Ha, ha. Very funny, Christine.

325
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,365
What's this?

326
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,668
What do you want?

327
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:08,007
I need you to finish teaching
me the loan procedures.

328
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,849
I've got a lot on my mind.
Can we do this tomorrow?

329
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,179
- Sure.
- Okay.

330
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,516
I'll just tell Mr Jacks
that you don't have the time right now.

331
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:19,921
- Maybe he can tell me.
- No, no! Okay, I'll do it.

332
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:21,687
Okay.

333
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:26,192
We were going over
the asset-based lending guidelines.

334
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:31,258
Right. Let's say your client is a company
that can't get traditional bank financing.

335
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,777
<i>- And?
- And...</i>

336
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,285
And?

337
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,789
And...

338
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,288
And get your filthy pig knuckle off my desk!

339
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,930
Christine Blood... Brown.

340
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,073
Christine. Your nose.

341
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,138
Sure, can you hold?

342
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:19,614
- Let me help you.
- No, no, I've got it under control.

343
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,975
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

344
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,653
God! Oh, my God! Stop it!

345
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,819
Mr Jacks!

346
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,654
- Did I get any in my mouth?
- Oh, my God!

347
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,991
- Did I get any in my mouth?
- Let me take you over here to get clean.

348
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,430
I'm so sorry! Oh, my God!

349
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:39,163
- What was that about?
- It's just a nosebleed.

350
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:42,501
- Did I get any in my mouth?
- We'll clean you up. We have antiseptic.

351
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,827
What is it?

352
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,892
Hi. I came to see Sylvia Ganush. Is she here?

353
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,025
Who are you?

354
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,498
I'm a friend of hers.

355
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,903
- Someone...
- Wait.

356
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:58,746
I know who you are.
Grandma told me you would come.

357
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:02,350
You are the woman from the bank,
the one who took her house.

358
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,183
Actually, it was the bank
that took the house.

359
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,416
I mean, I just work there.

360
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:10,250
In fact, I tried to help your
grandma get the house back,

361
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,919
but my boss wouldn't let me.

362
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,761
Are you going to stand here
on my porch and lie to my face?

363
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:25,775
- No.
- You used to be a real fat girl, didn't you?

364
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,577
- Yeah.
- I can tell.

365
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,554
You are not welcome here.

366
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,290
Wait! Wait. I need to see her.

367
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,452
I need her to forgive me.
And I'll get her the house back.

368
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:47,564
And you are gonna make everything
all right for her, is that it?

369
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:48,792
Yes.

370
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:51,633
Come on.

371
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:08,410
Where is she?

372
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:04,201
- Get her off me! Get her off me!
- Come! Don't look.

373
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,301
- Grab her shoulder.
- Be a man! Lift her up!

374
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,217
- Be careful.
- Let's roll the dice!

375
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:23,221
Still going to make
everything all right for her?

376
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,688
You deserve everything
that is coming to you.

377
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,231
One more time!

378
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,834
I believe what plagues you is the Lamia.

379
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,174
Lamia, that's the word the old woman used.

380
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:45,238
The Black Goat, only summoned
by gypsies for their darkest deeds.

381
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:51,511
For the first three days, the Lamia appears
as a nasty spirit that torments its victim.

382
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:54,524
After that, it reveals
itself to be a taker of souls,

383
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:57,026
and it comes for the owner
of the accursed object.

384
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:58,584
Accursed object. What object?

385
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,097
Something taken from the victim,
cursed and given back.

386
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,400
This?

387
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:10,768
What if I just burn it?

388
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,934
I'm afraid no matter
what condition the button is in,

389
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,937
you would still be the owner.
The Lamia would still come to take you.

390
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,743
Take me where?

391
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:30,723
- Then how do I get rid of this?
- You could attempt to appease the spirit.

392
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:32,729
The simplest way
would be a blood offering.

393
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:36,733
A small creature could be sacrificed,
a chicken perhaps.

394
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:38,894
No way! Look, I'm a vegetarian.

395
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,905
I volunteer at the puppy shelter,
for Christ's sake.

396
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:44,066
I don't go around killing animals.

397
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,075
You will be surprised
what you'll be willing to do

398
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,304
when the Lamia comes for you.

399
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:52,639
This will show you how.

400
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:09,959
Hi!

401
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

402
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

403
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

404
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:58,656
Here, kitty, kitty.

405
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,048
Chris! Chris?

406
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:24,983
Chris?

407
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,591
Hey, there you are.
What are you doing out here?

408
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,354
Baby, I called the bank.
They said you left early.

409
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:34,920
You're not answering my calls.
Is that blood?

410
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:40,330
No. Why would there be blood?

411
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,373
Yeah, baby, there's...
There's blood on your sleeve.

412
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,499
- Are you bleeding?
- No.

413
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,370
It was just tomato juice.

414
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:52,177
I was cutting a tomato in the kitchen
and it must have gotten on my sleeve.

415
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:58,587
Hey, Chris, why don't we
do this dinner another time?

416
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,118
You've had a rough couple of days.
I think it's better.

417
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,285
No, I want to go to the dinner.

418
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,728
I know, but are you sure
you're feeling all right?

419
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,865
Honestly, I haven't been.

420
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,700
But I think...

421
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:22,945
I think that everything
is gonna be okay now.

422
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:26,409
I really do.

423
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:32,949
What do you think?

424
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,323
You look beautiful.

425
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:45,062
- God, it's such a nice day!
- It really is. My God.

426
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,399
It's gonna be nice inside, too.

427
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:51,974
They're gonna love you.

428
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:56,337
- Clayton.
- Hello, Mother.

429
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,675
Good to see you. This is Christine.

430
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,772
- That's my mom, Trudy.
- Hello, Christine.

431
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,943
Hello. It's very nice to meet you.

432
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,754
- Well.
- Please, come in. Come in.

433
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:05,914
Yes.

434
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,619
- Hey, Dad, how are you?
- Hey, son.

435
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,420
Good to see you, sir.

436
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,256
This is Christine.
Christine, this is my dad, Leonard.

437
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,420
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Maria. Thank you.

438
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:16,091
- You have a beautiful home.
- Well, thank you very much.

439
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,425
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah, wine?

440
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:19,867
- Do you guys want?
- Sure.

441
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,770
- Okay. Come help me.
- I'll be right back.

442
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,666
- I'll take a Chardonnay!
- Yes, dear.

443
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,307
- I hope you don't mind.
- How thoughtful.

444
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:32,042
- Homemade?
- Yes.

445
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,947
And what type of cake would you call that?

446
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,010
It's called

447
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:39,450
a harvest cake.

448
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:42,617
Is that something you would make on a farm?

449
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:44,721
No.

450
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:52,630
I mean, not any more.
We used to when we had a gaggle of geese.

451
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:55,365
- Geese?
- Well, right around the harvest time,

452
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:58,566
that's when your goose eggs
will make a real dense yolk.

453
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:01,134
It makes for a rich cake.

454
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,382
Well, just thank you.

455
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Here we are.
- Sorry to interrupt the bonding sesh.
- Why don't you join us in the dining room?
- Good.
- Yeah, let's go. It's right in here.
- Okay.

456
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:15,916
- Jeez.
- Hecuba.

457
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,589
I never did understand
that damned animal. I hate cats.

458
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:23,326
That is so strange.
Hecuba is usually very sweet.

459
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,233
That's okay. I had a cat. I understand.

460
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:29,395
You mean... You mean you have a cat.

461
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:32,005
What do you mean?
Did something happen?

462
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:34,101
Unless something happened to him.

463
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,941
Well, how am I supposed to know?

464
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,512
I mean, you know how cats are.
They come and they go.

465
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,180
That's true.

466
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:52,461
- Well, should...
- Well... Yes. Yes, please.

467
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,460
So, how's the coin collection, son?

468
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,433
That's my dad's way of saying,
"So, you're still a huge nerd?"

469
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,867
It's good. It's good.
In fact, Christine just got me

470
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:02,906
a 1929 Standing Liberty quarter at her bank.

471
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:05,032
- Really?
- Isn't that crazy? Yeah, it's rare.

472
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:08,408
I just think the job of a bank
teller must be so difficult,

473
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:12,142
with all that counting and repetition.
It must get very tedious.

474
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,443
Yes, you're right,

475
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,714
- but I'm not a teller.
- Oh?

476
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:17,583
Yeah, Mom, I told you.
Christine's a loan officer.

477
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,987
She handles all the loans
for small businesses and homes for her bank.

478
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,618
And she's up for this big
promotion, so... Right, Chris?

479
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,891
If I could close this one account that
I'm working on, it would really help.

480
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:30,058
That must be a very important loan.

481
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:32,967
It's the biggest that my branch
has ever handled.

482
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,231
And how did that come to you?

483
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,733
<i>Well, I was reading
the Wall Street Journal</i>

484
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:40,106
and came across
this medical supply company

485
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:43,613
that was looking to expand
but didn't have the liquidity.

486
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,581
So I met with their CFO
and presented a formula

487
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,414
for restructuring
some of their long-term debt.

488
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:52,080
Sounds like you've got
a lot going for you, Christine.

489
00:54:52,156 --> 00:54:55,023
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.

490
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:56,658
I suppose.

491
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,601
I don't see much of my mother.

492
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:07,865
- Why is that?
- Wow, Mom, that's... It's kind of personal.

493
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,030
I'm speaking to Christine.

494
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:18,645
Well, ever since my dad died,
she doesn't talk much.

495
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:25,487
She just stays on the farm
and keeps to herself because...

496
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,291
Because?

497
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:32,124
Because her husband died, Mom,
and she just wants to be by herself.

498
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:35,290
- Why don't...
- Because my mother's an alcoholic.

499
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,024
Oh.

500
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,026
I'm sorry.

501
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,802
It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.

502
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,740
I have to say,
I find your honesty very refreshing.

503
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,979
My father had a drinking problem,
and I was always too ashamed to admit it.

504
00:55:54,218 --> 00:55:56,083
You've got backbone.

505
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:58,482
Unlike that last girl he brought by.

506
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:00,147
- What was her name?
- Alice.

507
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:01,748
- We don't have to...
- Alicia!

508
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,986
- Alicia.
- She was dreadful, Christine.

509
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:07,155
She was ill-mannered, no ambition at all.

510
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:08,357
- That's not really...
- They met on the Internet.

511
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:09,524
- There you go.
- What is that,

512
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,658
- "They met on the Internet"?
- Really?

513
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,998
- What does that mean?
- Am I being too hard on him?

514
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,094
No, not at all.

515
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,535
- There you go. Thank you very much.
- Thanks a lot...

516
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:17,267
You know, I think I will try
some of that cake of yours.

517
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,705
- ... for tossing me under the bus.
- Look at that. It looks great.

518
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,740
- You're gonna like it.
- It looks so interesting.

519
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:26,213
You only dislike it
if you hate delicious things.

520
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,842
- Well, that counts us out.
- Not my problem.

521
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,245
Lovely.

522
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:33,846
Thank you, Christine.
This is wonderful.

523
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,755
It also changed the subject nicely.

524
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,588
Thank you. That looks good!

525
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:40,052
- Harvest cake, huh?
- That's right.

526
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,530
- We'll have to get this recipe.
- It sounds so quaint, doesn't it?

527
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,430
Did you hear something?

528
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,529
No. You okay?

529
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:48,364
Tasty!

530
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,107
- I like it a lot.
- I do like it.

531
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:55,905
You know, Mom, when you say we
met on the Internet, it's a little misleading.

532
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:17,061
Yes, well you need
to do that to find a good mate.

533
00:57:17,134 --> 00:57:18,658
- She has a Facebook...
- You can't even trust

534
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,896
the things you hear or that
people write about themselves.

535
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:22,996
- Very nice.
- Even the pictures are false half the time.

536
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,300
- Isn't that true?
- It's true.

537
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:26,433
- It doesn't really count.
- I don't think it's a misconception

538
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,137
to think that people of good breeding

539
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:32,443
and success should be able to meet
potential life partners in a realistic situation.

540
00:57:32,516 --> 00:57:34,108
Well, you also have a thing about bars.

541
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,523
Would you, Christine?

542
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:52,665
- No. No, of course not.
- What? What... But we did.

543
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,634
We met at a bar, Chris.
What are you talking about?

544
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:56,502
- Oh, my God, that's right!
- She...

545
00:57:56,606 --> 00:58:01,009
- You two better get your stories straight.
- It's not a Klan rally, Mom. It's a bar.

546
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:07,150
Yeah, we met... We met at a bar,
and we set up the date on the Internet.

547
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:11,144
You okay? You okay?

548
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:15,983
Some water? Baby, have some...
Went down the wrong pipe.

549
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,291
Oh, my God!

550
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,641
I'm sorry, I don't...
There must be a window open.

551
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,004
Chris?

552
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:41,214
Okay, I hear you!

553
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:42,808
- What in the hell?
- Leave me alone.

554
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:45,319
- Just leave me the hell alone!
- Hey! Hey! Chris! Stop it!

555
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:47,515
Baby! There's no one there.

556
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,252
Okay.

557
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:56,930
- I think I'd better go.
- Yes, I think that would be best.

558
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:01,527
- I know. Wait, Chris...
- Don't follow her! She's a sick girl.

559
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:04,039
- Mom, she needs my help.
- Let her go.

560
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:07,334
Wait!

561
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,445
What's the matter?

562
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:14,940
Look, I did what you said!
I killed that little kitty!

563
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,216
You're so full of shit!

564
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:20,085
These are elusive and powerful forces
we are dealing with.

565
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,124
There are no guarantees.

566
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:42,544
We must speak directly to this dark spirit.

567
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,811
We must dissuade it from
taking your soul, and soon.

568
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:51,886
- I know someone who can help us.
- And I'm supposed to trust you?

569
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:56,049
Tomorrow is the third day.
After that, the Lamia will come for you.

570
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,322
We can't let that happen.
But you must understand,

571
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:03,992
the woman who can help us
must put herself at great risk.

572
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,826
- She will not do that for free.
- What do you need from me?

573
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,401
$10,000 cash

574
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:13,170
by tomorrow.

575
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,419
- Mr Jacks.
- Yeah?

576
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:33,359
This is kind of awkward for me,
and I know it's not official yet,

577
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:38,128
but I was wondering if I could get
an advance for the new position.

578
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:40,431
What, the assistant manager's position?

579
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:43,768
Yes. See, one of my family
members is really sick.

580
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:48,268
- They're not gonna die, but they could.
- Christine. Christine.

581
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:53,008
There's a problem.
The McPherson deal was cancelled last night.

582
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:54,549
- What?
- Yeah.

583
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:58,949
Right after I informed the regional office
that we had this big loan pending,

584
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:02,547
I find out that they just made
their deal over at First National.

585
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,524
Now, I gotta call in to see
what exactly happened,

586
01:01:04,628 --> 01:01:08,564
but right now, this does not
look too good for you or for me.

587
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:14,399
So, this assistant manager
promotion has been delayed.

588
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,474
In fact, you know, I think, with
everything that's been happening,

589
01:01:18,575 --> 01:01:21,738
I think I'm gonna have
to give this job to Stu.

590
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:24,409
Stu. I see.

591
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:28,144
I'm sorry.
Look, if you've got family problems,

592
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:31,743
maybe you should take the day off,
sort them out and...

593
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

594
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:42,986
- So, how much?
- $3,800 for everything.

595
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,959
- Including my jewellery?
- Including.

596
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:48,929
But this stuff is worth
so much more than that.

597
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:53,231
Please. This is all I have. I'm begging you.

598
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:56,401
Take it or leave it.

599
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:06,846
Chris? Chris?

600
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,513
Baby?

601
01:03:30,707 --> 01:03:33,369
I thought you were lactose intolerant.

602
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:35,871
I am.

603
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:40,278
But then I thought,
"Screw it, I'm eating ice cream. "

604
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,214
I paid Rham Jas.

605
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:51,717
What? You're kidding me.

606
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,120
I paid him.

607
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:58,224
Why? I mean, I thought
that you didn't believe.

608
01:03:58,702 --> 01:04:01,694
I don't know what I believe in any more.

609
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:05,571
I really don't,
but I know that you believe in this.

610
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,337
I know how important it is to you,

611
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,812
and I know how much pain
this is causing you.

612
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:16,978
And, I also remembered...

613
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:20,484
I remembered a promise that I made

614
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,923
the night I fell in love with you.

615
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,255
I told myself that I would...

616
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:30,932
I would always look out for you.
I'd always take care of you.

617
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:34,259
So I paid him.

618
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,273
You remember the night
that you fell in love with me?

619
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:43,402
I remember the second
I fell in love with you.

620
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:46,514
Oh, my God.

621
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,859
You sure you don't
want me to go in with you?

622
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:03,398
He said I should come alone.

623
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:06,799
Yeah, I know, I know he did.
He told me the same thing.

624
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,834
Christine, if you will permit me

625
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:48,137
the pleasure of an introduction,
Shaun San Dena.

626
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:54,074
- Welcome.
- How do you do?

627
01:05:55,018 --> 01:05:57,248
Shaun San Dena is an experienced medium.

628
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:00,447
Furthermore, she's personally
been touched by the Lamia.

629
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:05,017
I first encountered this spirit
many years ago in this very house.

630
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:08,023
And what happened?

631
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:14,934
I lost a young boy's soul to the beast.

632
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:24,142
I have waited these long years

633
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:28,707
for a chance at redeeming myself,

634
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:32,347
a chance to destroy the foul thing.

635
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:35,217
<i>- And...
- Tetièko, please.</i>

636
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:43,388
Tonight, my chance will come.

637
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:48,230
But to summon it, I will need your help.

638
01:06:49,706 --> 01:06:51,367
Can you be strong?

639
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:55,408
I'll try.

640
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,746
My late husband, Sandor,
was also medium.

641
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,254
He chose this site to build a house upon

642
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:10,257
because he sensed
certain forces at work here.

643
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:14,919
In this place, there is a particular...

644
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,263
A particular confluence of forces

645
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:28,536
which allows a doorway to be opened
through which we may pass...

646
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:36,881
...and through which others
may pass into our world.

647
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:44,286
Please be seated.

648
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

649
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:13,646
What's going on?

650
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:19,490
Everything we're doing is for your
own good. Please. Christine, please.

651
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,432
Thank you.

652
01:08:56,366 --> 01:09:00,359
Once the spirit has entered me,
put my hand upon the animal.

653
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,530
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

654
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:10,203
I force the spirit of the Lamia into the goat.
Milos, that's when you strike.

655
01:09:13,216 --> 01:09:14,706
I understand.

656
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,653
We all must be receptive.

657
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:46,412
- What am I supposed to do?
- You must allow the darkness in.

658
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:50,178
You must invite the dead
to co-mingle with your spirit.

659
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:53,215
- I'm scared.
- Yes.

660
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:58,887
Now repeat these words,
"I welcome the dead into my soul. "

661
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:06,056
- I welcome the dead into my soul.
- You must believe it!

662
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:09,202
I welcome the dead into my soul.

663
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,835
- I welcome the dead into my soul.
- I welcome the dead into my soul.

664
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:17,371
- I welcome the dead into my soul.
- ... into my soul.

665
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:24,018
I welcome the dead into my soul.
I welcome the dead into my soul.

666
01:10:24,187 --> 01:10:33,562
I welcome the dead into my soul.

667
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:34,857
I welcome the dead...

668
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:43,269
I welcome the dead into my soul.

669
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:44,896
I welcome the dead into...

670
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:50,776
Something else is here with us.

671
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,473
Yes.

672
01:11:22,145 --> 01:11:24,079
This is not the Lamia.

673
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:27,412
It is the spirit of some

674
01:11:28,084 --> 01:11:31,451
unsettled soul from years ago.

675
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:35,481
Sometimes the unsettled
ones linger by the door.

676
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,254
There are others here, as well.

677
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:52,440
Begone, foolish spirits! Begone!

678
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:07,555
She is coming.

679
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

680
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:53,660
Who now inhabits the
body of Shaun San Dena?

681
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,894
Lamia!

682
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:09,068
Lamia, what is it you desire?

683
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:13,479
I desire the soul of Christine Brown!

684
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:17,446
We will feast upon it
as she festers in the grave!

685
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,080
No! It was my manager, Jim Jacks!

686
01:14:20,156 --> 01:14:22,021
- He was the one! He was...
- Silence!

687
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:26,356
Lamia, surely you can be dissuaded
from taking this insignificant woman.

688
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,363
Surely she is not worthy of your greatness.

689
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,606
No!

690
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:47,013
I come for you, Christine.

691
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:50,776
You're mine!

692
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,220
No!

693
01:14:57,393 --> 01:15:01,193
You tricked me! You black-hearted whore!

694
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:03,857
- Now, Milos, now!
- You bitch.

695
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

696
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:19,146
Away, unclean spirit.

697
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:36,562
Lamia!

698
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:41,261
As one who summoned you to this circle,
I command you to leave this instant.

699
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,200
Christine!

700
01:15:55,851 --> 01:16:00,379
I don't want your cat, you dirty pork queen!

701
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:13,428
Shaun San Dena!

702
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,371
You must banish the spirit!

703
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:17,563
Yes!

704
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:51,234
Milos!

705
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:55,908
- Oh, my God. I'm okay.
- Thank God!

706
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,912
- I'm okay.
- Unbelievable!

707
01:17:00,516 --> 01:17:02,507
- You did it!
- Thank God.

708
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,018
I tried.

709
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:07,146
Are you okay?

710
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:09,754
Oh, my God. Help me!

711
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:16,426
Call an ambulance.

712
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:21,929
Is she breathing?

713
01:17:23,506 --> 01:17:25,030
No.

714
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,441
Oh, my gosh.

715
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,411
- It's so sad.
- Yes.

716
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,321
Strange how things work out.

717
01:18:16,392 --> 01:18:20,351
She waited 40 years for another
chance to overcome the Lamia,

718
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:26,727
and finally, on the last
night of her life, she did.

719
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:30,163
No, I'm afraid you misunderstand.

720
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:34,274
The Lamia cannot be banished by a medium.

721
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,679
This is our lesson tonight. I'm sorry.

722
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:39,680
- But I saw her get rid of the thing.
- No.

723
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:43,047
You saw her drive it from a séance.
That is all.

724
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:46,778
It will be back.
The goat was never slaughtered.

725
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:49,717
When this night is through,

726
01:18:50,526 --> 01:18:54,189
the Lamia will come for the owner
of the accursed object.

727
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:02,633
Unless, of course, you are no longer
the owner. Do you have the button?

728
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:14,210
Make a gift of it and
you've given the curse away.

729
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:19,581
Why didn't you tell me this before?

730
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:23,216
Because the Lamia will tear the soul
out of whoever you give that to.

731
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:25,817
They'll burn in hell for eternity.

732
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,656
And I would have sent them there.

733
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,565
And I would be your accomplice.

734
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:38,903
Whatever you decide, you have till morning.

735
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:01,360
Is it over?

736
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's over.

737
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:08,996
Clay!

738
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:15,510
You will burn in hell!

739
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:20,542
You will burn in hell!
You bitch, you'll burn in hell!

740
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:22,847
Your turn's coming!

741
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:25,819
- You will burn in hell!
- You okay?

742
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,354
Holy shit.

743
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:44,562
Okay, you sure you're still okay
about the Santa Barbara trip?

744
01:20:44,707 --> 01:20:45,731
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

745
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:49,743
- And what time should I get you?
- It's better if I meet you at the station.

746
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:51,345
There's something I've gotta do on the way.

747
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:53,506
I can do it. You want me
to do it on my way to...

748
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:56,016
No! No. I've got it under control.

749
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:59,586
We'll meet at, like, 7:30 at the...
Wait! Where's my envelope?

750
01:20:59,722 --> 01:21:02,190
- What envelope?
- It was in my purse. I just had it!

751
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:04,350
- It's just an envelope.
- No, it's gotta be here!

752
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:07,361
It's here, so we'll find it eventually.

753
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,361
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

754
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:12,093
I thought I'd lost it. Okay.

755
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:15,426
Bye. 7:30. Don't be late.

756
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,946
Dad, can we go to the Angel game?

757
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:40,087
- What about the Dodgers?
- We're only gonna be in town for a few days.

758
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:46,129
I'm sure if I just tell him
how much I care about you,

759
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,566
I mean, he's gotta understand.

760
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:54,571
Are you sure
you don't want anything else?

761
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:55,632
No.

762
01:21:55,778 --> 01:21:58,906
So you're just gonna sit here
drinking coffee all night long.

763
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:02,246
Yes. Maybe! What's it to you?

764
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:06,549
Honey, I make my money on tips.
Coffee drinkers don't tip.

765
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:10,557
Honey, just keep the coffee coming
or I'll give you a tip you won't forget.

766
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:56,098
Oh, my gosh. What a delightful surprise.

767
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:59,769
You're the sweetest person in the world.

768
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:04,105
Never mind what it's about, Stu.

769
01:23:04,213 --> 01:23:06,181
Just get here in 10 minutes
or I'm gonna tell Mr Jacks

770
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:08,476
something you don't want me to tell him.

771
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:10,882
<i>Oh, yeah? Like what?</i>

772
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:14,951
Well, for starters, that you stole
the McPherson loan file off my desk

773
01:23:15,057 --> 01:23:18,390
and gave it to First National.
Now you got nine minutes!

774
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:25,560
- Give me another.
- Seriously?

775
01:23:33,909 --> 01:23:38,676
Oh, God, Christine, please don't tell on me.
I mean, if my dad ever finds out...

776
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:42,046
- Just tell me what you want.
- I need to give something to you.

777
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:44,243
- A little gift.
- A gift?

778
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:48,019
But I don't understand.
I thought you called me down here

779
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:49,990
because I gave that loan to First National...

780
01:23:50,092 --> 01:23:53,220
Look, you don't need to understand.
Just shut up!

781
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:57,393
Now, this gift that I'm giving you,
it'll become your property.

782
01:23:57,499 --> 01:24:00,093
You'll be the owner, all right?

783
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:04,235
Okay.

784
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:10,737
Okay.

785
01:24:13,949 --> 01:24:15,246
What?

786
01:24:16,685 --> 01:24:17,743
Forget it.

787
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:21,248
But I thought you wanted to give it to me
'cause of the loan stuff.

788
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:22,721
Just leave.

789
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:28,796
Okay. Thank you so much, Christine.

790
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:37,232
- But you're not gonna tell my dad, right?
- Go!

791
01:24:37,306 --> 01:24:38,398
Okay.

792
01:24:49,318 --> 01:24:51,309
Who does deserve this?

793
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:14,267
Well? Is it possible?

794
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:18,570
There are gypsy blessings
bestowed upon the dead.

795
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,773
They give gifts to their departed

796
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:25,182
to curry favour with the deceased's soul,
for, truly, the soul never dies.

797
01:25:27,022 --> 01:25:32,016
Yes. I do believe you can give the curse
to someone who has passed on,

798
01:25:32,361 --> 01:25:35,819
<i>but you must make a formal gift
of the accursed object to the deceased.</i>

799
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'll do better than that.
I'll shove it down her goddamn throat!
I'm gonna get some...

01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

801
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,435
I'm giving it back to you!

802
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,575
You're gonna take this thing.

803
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Are you gonna take this thing?
Take it!

804
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,503
That's the last of my hair you're getting!

805
01:28:03,912 --> 01:28:09,942
I, Christine Brown,
do hereby make a formal gift of this button

806
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:12,350
to you, Sylvia Ganush!

807
01:28:14,256 --> 01:28:16,190
Choke on it, bitch!

808
01:28:31,206 --> 01:28:32,673
Goodbye.

809

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

810
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:05,032
<i>Hi, It's Christine.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

811
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:08,099
<i>Christine, it's Jim, Jim Jacks.</i>

812
01:30:08,203 --> 01:30:09,568
<i>I'm sorry I'm calling so early,</i>

813
01:30:09,638 --> 01:30:14,200
<i>but last night, I found some troubling
information about our friend Stu Rubin.</i>

814
01:30:14,476 --> 01:30:17,934
<i>Apparently, he stole your
file on the McPherson loan</i>

815
01:30:18,046 --> 01:30:21,379
<i>and then tried to broker
his own deal at First National.</i>

816
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:23,417
<i>I guess he thought we wouldn't find out.</i>

817
01:30:23,485 --> 01:30:26,147
<i>And we wouldn't have either,
except that an hour ago,</i>

818
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:30,054
<i>he came by my house and tried
to pin the whole thing on you.</i>

819
01:30:31,126 --> 01:30:34,653
<i>After I confronted him about
a few inconsistencies in his story,</i>

820
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:39,132
<i>he broke down crying and, well,
we won't be seeing him around any more.</i>

821
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:43,499
<i>So I just wanted you to know that,
come Monday morning,</i>

822
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:47,336
<i>that assistant manager's
position will be waiting for you.</i>

823

<i>Passenger Benson,
please meet your party</i>

824
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:03,749

<i>- Welcome to Union Station.
- Cookie, miss?</i>

01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:09,521
<i>- No, thanks.
- We appreciate you choosing</i>

827
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:14,625
<i>train travel as your mode of transportation,
and we wish you a pleasant journey.</i>

828
01:31:28,216 --> 01:31:29,877
Hi. Good morning.

829
01:31:30,218 --> 01:31:33,381
- I'm sorry, we're not open.
- I just... I just want this coat.

830
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:34,545
We're not open yet.

831
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:38,716
My boyfriend and I are
taking this really special trip this morning.

832
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:41,153
Please?

01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:52,005
<i>- San Luis Obispo...
- Clay?</i>

836
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:54,564
- Hey!
- Hey! Oh, man! Hi.

837
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:57,076
God, I'm so glad you're here.
So many things I wanna tell you.

838
01:31:57,212 --> 01:31:58,338
Wait, there's something I wanna say

839
01:31:58,413 --> 01:32:01,348
- while I have it straight in my head.
- Okay. Go ahead.

840
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:03,884
You never stopped believing in me.

841
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,414
Thank you for that.

842
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:12,250
And there's something else,
something that I couldn't admit to before.

843
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:17,864
I could have given Mrs Ganush
another extension on her loan, but I didn't.

844
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:23,562
It was my decision, and it was wrong of me.

845
01:32:33,615 --> 01:32:35,549
You have such a good heart.

846
01:32:38,086 --> 01:32:39,610
You're so beautiful right now.

847
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,724
- Do you like my new coat?
- I do. I really do.

848
01:32:44,793 --> 01:32:46,454
- What happened to the old one, though?
- I threw it out.

849
01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:49,222
- And I never want to see it again.
- Oh, no.

850
01:32:49,464 --> 01:32:53,298
That's too bad, because I... Look
what I found. I found this in the car.

851
01:32:53,768 --> 01:32:55,133
I thought...

852
01:32:55,637 --> 01:32:58,071
And I thought maybe you could...

853
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:01,067
I thought maybe you could sew it back on.

854
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:04,305
And I think you might have
my Standing Liberty quarter,

855
01:33:04,446 --> 01:33:06,971
'cause the envelopes kind of look the same.

856
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,573
Chris, what's wrong?

857
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:12,917
- Oh, my God!
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

858
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:15,385
- Oh, God.
- Hey, hey. Hey! Hey!

859
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:17,822
Stop! Chris! Oh, God!

860
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:23,394
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, no!
Hey! Oh, God, no!

861
01:33:28,503 --> 01:33:30,164
Hey, no!

862
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:37,172
Help me!

863
01:33:41,683 --> 01:33:42,911
Help me!

864
01:33:43,852 --> 01:33:45,342
Help me!

865
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:48,178
Help me, please!
