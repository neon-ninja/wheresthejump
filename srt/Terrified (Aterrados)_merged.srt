1
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,629
You have to call him at least three times
until he answers.

3
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:11,175
Hey, I have some breaking news.

4
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:14,805
Do you remember the dog
we ran over the other day?

5
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:17,099
Guess what?

6
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:21,105
It's alive! The dog is alive.

7
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:24,443
We ran it over and thought it was dead,
but it's alive.

8
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:26,363
It's like Highlander.

9
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,950
Thank God we didn't bury it, right?

10
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:31,787
What happened? Change of plans?

11
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:33,830
I couldn't make dinner.

12
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,753
It's early. Should we order something?

13
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:40,255
I couldn't cook
because I heard voices in the kitchen.

14
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:45,888
Here? In the kitchen?

15
00:03:02,452 --> 00:03:03,871
I know what I heard.

16
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,290
I heard it all the afternoon.

17
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:07,584
They were talking.

18
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:12,925
The plumbling is old.
Maybe the pipes squeal.

19
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:16,555
What do you think you heard?

20
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,186
Besides Walter, the neighbour,
is repairing his house.

21
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,982
There's noise here all the time.

22
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,446
Has he made any noise today?
Have you heard him?

23
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:35,204
Don't be scared.

24
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:37,416
They were human voices.

25
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,589
What did they tell you?

26
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:46,803
That they were going to kill me.

27
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:23,937
Son of a bitch!

28
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:36,579
You shouldn't bang at this time!

29
00:04:58,441 --> 00:04:59,902
Stop banging!

30
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:01,946
Stop making noise, asshole!

31
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:03,782
Stop it!

32
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,170
Now, you're gonna listen to me,
motherfucker.

33
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:34,991
Answer me, damn it.

34
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,954
Walter?

35
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:41,958
Walter.

36
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:44,670
Walter, it's Juan!

37
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:49,928
I know you're there, asshole,
I can hear you.

38
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:56,978
I can hear you! Come on, is that you?

39
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:01,401
Can you stop banging on the wall?

40
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:06,867
Stop banging on the wall, asshole.
I can hear it from my house.

41
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,787
It's 5 a.m.! Are you nuts?

42
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,457
Do you want me to call the police?

43
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,459
You jerk!

44
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,553
Your fucking neighbor
is smashing the walls at 5 a.m.

45
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:38,148
That's not Walter.

46
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,987
Clara, is that you?

47
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,865
You the one who's banging?

48
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:52,955
Clara?

49
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,391
Stop it, Clara!

50
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,018
No, Clara!

51
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,854
Clara!

52
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,277
Honey!

53
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,071
Stop it! Clara!

54
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,948
What is wrong with you?

55
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:29,866
Stop it!

56
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,286
Stop it, that's enough!

57
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,663
Clara!

58
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,541
What's happening? That's enough!

59
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,584
Stop it.

60
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,253
Enough! Stop it!

61
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,339
Stop it!

62
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,135
Clara, what's happening?

63
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,763
Stop it, Clara!

64
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,079
Mr. Blumetti, we want
to take you out of here.

65
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,838
We believe you.

66
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:16,930
But you'll have to cooperate with us.

67
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:20,064
Have you talked to my lawyer?

68
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,361
Yes, we have.

69
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:25,620
But it seems that he doesn't believe us.

70
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,516
I've already seen the pictures.

71
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:36,733
No, not these ones.
You have never seen these pictures.

72
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,905
We know that you didn't kill your wife.

73
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,788
We don't have concrete evidence.

74
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:44,170
But we'll be working on it.

75
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:47,387
Look at the pictures, Mr. Blumetti.

76
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,623
That's not Clara.

77
00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,921
That's not your wife.

78
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:08,150
In 1998, in the United States,
there was a case very similar to yours.

79
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:09,655
Almost identical.

80
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:13,039
Was it cleared up?

81
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:19,848
We need to know
everything you remember from that moment.

82
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,188
I've already told it to the prosecutor.

83
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:27,578
Everything you remember
from the last two weeks in your...

84
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,797
- In your neighborhood.
- Neighborhood.

85
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:35,473
Was there anything unusual?

86
00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:45,542
The accident outside my house.

87
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:54,483
I don't know. My neighbor Walter...

88
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:57,659
was very annoying.

89
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:01,920
He was doing home repairs at any time.

90
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,465
Repairs?

91
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:06,557
Your neighbor, Walter.

92
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,688
Walter Carabajal.

93
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:14,328
Hello?

94
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,420
Hello.
May I speak with Dr. Albreck, please?

95
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:20,176
Who is it?

96
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:21,931
I'm Walter Carabajal.

97
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:26,360
The doctor is not available now.
Would you like to leave her message?

98
00:10:26,444 --> 00:10:28,157
No.

99
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:30,287
I need to speak to her.

100
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,546
I have some issues at home.

101
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:35,927
It has been a few months now.

102
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:42,027
At first, I thought it was me,
but then it got worse.

103
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,787
It's hard to explain it on the phone.

104
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:48,336
Who gave you this number, Mr. Carabajal?

105
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:53,140
I've seen some specialists

106
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:55,772
and several agreed
on giving me this number.

107
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,738
I'm afraid
you'll have to call again tomorrow.

108
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:00,702
Okay.

109
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,537
I'm calling again tomorrow.

110
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,119
Could you tell her I called, please?

111
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

112
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:17,306
Please, please.

113
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:05,144
Hello?

114
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:07,228
Hi. It's Walter Carabajal.

115
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:09,687
I need help, please.

116
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,478
I haven't slept in weeks.
And my meds are not having any effect.

117
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:15,437
I'm in a difficult situation.

118
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:20,229
Tell the doctor that I saw it.

119
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:23,271
It's not longer noise, banging
or moving things.

120
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:25,896
I saw it yesterday.
I think it came from under the bed.

121
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:30,313
The doctor can't treat you now.
She can't accept your case.

122
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:31,856
I'm asking it nicely!

123
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:36,231
I need to speak to her immediately.

124
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:37,814
I'm going crazy.

125
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,065
We can refer you to another specialist.

126
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:46,023
No, no!
I've already talked to all of them.

127
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:49,274
And they all say the doctor
is the only one who can help me.

128
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:50,858
I can afford it.

129
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:53,732
I'll do whatever is necessary,
just tell me.

130
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:55,316
Please!

131
00:15:56,732 --> 00:16:01,275
The doctor does not accept any cases
without analyzing the evidence in person.

132
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:03,400
But she cannot do it at the moment.

133
00:16:04,525 --> 00:16:07,150
How can I give evidence
if it can't be seen?

134
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:11,818
I'm sorry, Mr. Carabajal.
We cannot help you.

135
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:20,277
Walter!

136
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:23,403
Hey.

137
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:26,111
What's wrong with your house?

138
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,028
Why?

139
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:29,867
Why? You cracked my wall.

140
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,161
There's banging all the time.

141
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:35,124
I'm doing some remodeling.

142
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,670
Some repairs.

143
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:40,841
You cracked my wall.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

144
00:16:47,183 --> 00:16:48,436
You want evidence?

145
00:16:48,978 --> 00:16:50,564
I'm giving you evidence.

146
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,647
Who are you?

147
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:09,985
Who are you?

148
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,685
Hey!

149
00:20:59,935 --> 00:21:01,312
What are you doing?

150
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:03,565
Don't drink that water.
Get out of my house.

151
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:05,860
I don't want to see you around here.

152
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,072
Do you hear me?

153
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:11,034
I'm saying it for your own good.
Get away from my house.

154
00:21:23,637 --> 00:21:24,763
What happened?

155
00:21:31,064 --> 00:21:33,067
- And?
- There was an accident.

156
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

157
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:49,216
Alicia!

158
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,639
Alicia!

159
00:21:58,397 --> 00:21:59,398
Alicia!

160
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:33,616
Call me if you need anything.

161
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:35,536
Thank you.

162
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:02,200
Hello?

163
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:04,328
Jano, it's Funes.

164
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:06,999
Funes?

165
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:08,543
Ramón?

166
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:11,839
I'm sorry for calling you this late,
but it's...

167
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,177
as you can imagine...

168
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:16,388
very important.

169
00:23:17,431 --> 00:23:18,808
Don't worry.

170
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:21,061
What's going on?

171
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:23,106
Four days ago, there was an accident.

172
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,362
A ten-year-old kid was ran over
and he died on his doorstep.

173
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,368
I need you here, Jano.

174
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,455
I need you to come over.

175
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,292
Okay.

176
00:23:36,627 --> 00:23:39,255
I'm sending a patrol car to pick you up.

177
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:41,300
It'll arrive in approximately an hour.

178
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:43,428
That's okay.

179
00:23:43,512 --> 00:23:46,349
You're the only one
who can tell me what's happening here.

180
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:20,942
Who's there?

181
00:24:51,738 --> 00:24:53,157
It's pretty late, right?

182
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,910
Pardon me?

183
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,543
Are you feeling alright?

184
00:25:13,687 --> 00:25:15,690
POLICE

185
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:24,829
Hi, Jano.

186
00:25:26,414 --> 00:25:27,792
Is it inside?

187
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:33,926
Nothing scares you, right?

188
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:37,098
You never know.

189
00:25:37,556 --> 00:25:38,599
Let's see.

190
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:51,703
He's sitting there.

191
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:55,583
He's officer Guzmán. You know him.

192
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,673
And Officer Picarel. They're trustworthy.

193
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:01,884
They were doing a routine patrol,

194
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:06,015
they saw the door opened,
they entered and found her in that state.

195
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:07,016
Boss...

196
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:09,562
should we wait outside?

197
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:13,944
Yes, you can go.

198
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,370
They're frightened.

199
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:24,287
And with good reason.

200
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:33,159
Jano...

201
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,491
the child died four days ago.

202
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:39,782
I was at the burial, I went to the wake.

203
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:42,490
Do you get it?

204
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:53,903
He appeared all of the sudden
and he sat there with us.

205
00:27:17,772 --> 00:27:18,771
Is it him?

206
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:23,729
The officers declared...

207
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,102
that they saw him move.

208
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:33,892
I also thought I'd seen him move,
I swear you.

209
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,839
It has a rotten smell.

210
00:28:22,754 --> 00:28:24,545
Yes, it has a bad smell.

211
00:28:27,086 --> 00:28:32,626
Do you believe Alicia
may have mounted all this?

212
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:35,667
Take a look at his hands, Funes.

213
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,333
They're destroyed.

214
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:42,498
He scratched the spoil for several days.

215
00:28:51,371 --> 00:28:52,496
You know what?

216
00:28:55,286 --> 00:28:57,619
There are a lot of cases
of desecration of graves

217
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,868
carried out by the relatives
of the deceased.

218
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:04,201
Some people cannot stand the idea
that their child is dead.

219
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:08,449
And some of them even steal the corpse.

220
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:14,864
I think we should analyze
the mother's clothes.

221
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:20,571
We may find a bacterial infection
or some cadaverous flora or fauna.

222
00:29:23,237 --> 00:29:25,404
You really don't know. You're hesitating.

223
00:29:25,487 --> 00:29:26,361
Yes.

224
00:29:27,444 --> 00:29:30,985
I have some serious doubts
about whether this is one of those cases.

225
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,983
You can give the explanation
I just gave you.

226
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,233
You weren't expecting this answer from me.

227
00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:41,149
No.

228
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:45,648
And that's okay.
Because that's not the answer.

229
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:48,438
But it's the one you should give.

230
00:29:57,936 --> 00:29:59,936
Do you know the mother?

231
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:01,227
What?

232
00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:03,768
I said, "Do you know the mother?"

233
00:30:06,517 --> 00:30:07,433
Yes, very well.

234
00:30:11,391 --> 00:30:13,390
We had a relationship...

235
00:30:15,098 --> 00:30:18,222
a very nice once for several years.

236
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:30,511
He moved.

237
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:43,049
Did he have the arm on the table
like it is now?

238
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,131
I think so.

239
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:48,588
You think? Jano!

240
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:52,129
Have you taken any pictures?

241
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:53,962
No, we haven't done anything.

242
00:30:56,586 --> 00:30:59,627
- And you shouldn't do anything.
- What do you mean?

243
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,710
Exactly that. We shouldn't do anything.

244
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:05,084
The best thing to do is bury him again.

245
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:07,708
Yeah, right.

246
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:11,415
Bury him?

247
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,165
Are you drunk, Jano?

248
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:17,247
Let me be clear, Funes.

249
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,704
I guess you're aware
about the trouble this may cause.

250
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:24,703
I suppose you know it.

251
00:31:24,787 --> 00:31:27,370
For example, if the Prosecutor intervenes,

252
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:30,452
your friend will be locked up
in a mental hospital.

253
00:31:30,827 --> 00:31:34,076
And given the context,
she'll spend several years there.

254
00:31:34,284 --> 00:31:37,117
We should try to find a way
to avoid that, right?

255
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:42,657
What do I say to my people?

256
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,912
Postmortem spasm...

257
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:54,299
caused by a build-up of gases.

258
00:31:54,717 --> 00:31:56,723
It's a decomposing body.

259
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:07,129
We should get injectable Valium.

260
00:32:07,212 --> 00:32:11,140
It's better for your friend to be sleeping
before we take his son.

261
00:32:11,683 --> 00:32:13,689
Don't turn the lights off again.

262
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,580
What's going on, kiddo?

263
00:32:35,836 --> 00:32:37,967
Why did you come to visit us?

264
00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:41,436
What brought you here?

265
00:33:05,422 --> 00:33:07,428
I must call my sister.

266
00:33:09,224 --> 00:33:11,230
She has to notify the priest.

267
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:16,621
I don't want you to take him, please.

268
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:18,585
Don't take my baby again.

269
00:33:41,735 --> 00:33:43,240
Excuse me, do I know you?

270
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:47,544
I see you're taking pictures.

271
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:51,096
I think I know you from somewhere else.

272
00:33:52,056 --> 00:33:54,187
Aren't you Mora Albreck?

273
00:33:57,573 --> 00:33:58,701
Yes, Dr. Albreck.

274
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,623
And you are?

275
00:34:01,793 --> 00:34:04,551
I can't believe
that I'm meeting you in person.

276
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:07,142
I'm Mario Jano.

277
00:34:07,225 --> 00:34:09,356
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

278
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,446
I attended several of your lectures.

279
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:14,120
About paranormal events, meta-symbiosis.

280
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:18,091
What are you searching for here?
May I help you?

281
00:34:19,052 --> 00:34:19,929
Is this here?

282
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:23,105
Yes.

283
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:26,405
It's weird.

284
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,579
I ring the intercom,

285
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:32,047
it seems that someone answers,
but nobody speaks.

286
00:34:33,175 --> 00:34:34,763
Nobody picks up the phone.

287
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:39,235
Do you know Mr. Carabajal?
Have you seen him lately?

288
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:41,909
No.

289
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:43,664
No, the thing is...

290
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,133
I don't live here, either.

291
00:34:47,801 --> 00:34:49,932
This is not pure chance.

292
00:34:50,977 --> 00:34:53,986
If I were to ask you to join me,

293
00:34:54,278 --> 00:34:55,281
would you accept?

294
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,042
You'll find it interesting.
I'm sure about that.

295
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:19,351
Funes, this is Dr. Albreck,
a colleague, a true expert.

296
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,613
- Can I talk to you for a moment?
- Yes. Excuse me.

297
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:29,297
- Did you call her?
- No.

298
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,096
- You didn't?
- No, but this isn't a coincidence.

299
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:36,317
It doesn't matter.
We won't be able to transport the body.

300
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,236
Why not?

301
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:39,074
We're in broad daylight.

302
00:35:39,158 --> 00:35:41,414
It's complicated. People will see us.

303
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,008
You telling me that you
can't handle the cemetery issue?

304
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:47,850
- You're the superintendent.
- It's not about that.

305
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,569
There are cars, people.
They'll see us with the kid.

306
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:52,655
I'm not doing it.

307
00:35:52,781 --> 00:35:55,330
I think this is the correct alternative.

308
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:57,586
- Is it?
- Yes.

309
00:35:57,837 --> 00:35:58,672
Really?

310
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,762
Hey! She's taking pictures.

311
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:02,810
Yes. She knows what she's doing.

312
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:04,899
- Jano, she's taking pictures.
- Trust me.

313
00:36:04,982 --> 00:36:07,615
She knows what she's doing.
Trust me, please.

314
00:36:08,493 --> 00:36:11,543
- Are you aware about my health issues?
- Yes, I am.

315
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,542
I'm retiring in two months.

316
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:17,329
I haven't got a single stain in my file.

317
00:36:17,538 --> 00:36:20,200
Do you know the mess I can get into
because of this?

318
00:36:20,282 --> 00:36:22,072
- Do you?
- Listen to me, Funes.

319
00:36:22,155 --> 00:36:26,232
- This is the right choice.
- Alicia's friends are about to arrive.

320
00:36:26,315 --> 00:36:29,103
They're coming to drink mate.
The child's at the table.

321
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:31,182
Will you listen to me, please?

322
00:36:32,347 --> 00:36:33,428
You haven't slept.

323
00:36:34,011 --> 00:36:34,967
You're stressed.

324
00:36:35,717 --> 00:36:37,048
You have to do this.

325
00:36:37,256 --> 00:36:38,920
Take the officers with you.

326
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,414
Go to the cemetery to solve
the burial issue.

327
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:46,657
Let me and Albreck handle this.
We'll take care of Alicia.

328
00:36:47,531 --> 00:36:49,944
And remove that patrol car

329
00:36:50,027 --> 00:36:53,563
before the neighbors start wondering
what's going on, please.

330
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:00,719
What are you two hiding?

331
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:04,629
Have you already seen this?

332
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:14,323
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

333
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:16,236
- Hey, listen!
- No, you listen to me.

334
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:17,692
Are we doing things correctly?

335
00:37:18,441 --> 00:37:21,228
Yes. We need two bags of concrete mix.

336
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:23,225
What for?

337
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:26,262
What for?
Do you want him to leave his grave again?

338
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:29,215
Fucking hell.

339
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:51,929
That smell...

340
00:37:54,176 --> 00:37:55,507
A rotten smell.

341
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:57,295
No.

342
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,414
Not the smell of something rotten,
but of something dead.

343
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,781
Now we're speaking the same language.

344
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:41,185
Please, take a seat.
I want to tell you something.

345
00:38:46,384 --> 00:38:47,300
You know...

346
00:38:48,964 --> 00:38:51,917
I used to be a coroner.
I worked more than 15 years

347
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,247
with superintendent Funes.

348
00:38:55,412 --> 00:38:57,409
I did a lot a of autopsies.

349
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,278
And one day,

350
00:39:01,694 --> 00:39:03,732
I had to examine
the body of a young man.

351
00:39:03,815 --> 00:39:04,814
Twenty years old.

352
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:07,393
He had 14 bullets in the head.

353
00:39:10,471 --> 00:39:12,468
I didn't have a choice.

354
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,133
I had to remove...

355
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:22,536
I scratched for five hours
in that guy's skull.

356
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:25,863
One moment,

357
00:39:27,902 --> 00:39:28,983
he grabbed my arm.

358
00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:31,022
He squeezed me.

359
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,975
He opened his eyes to look at me.

360
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:35,349
He woke up.

361
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:42,629
Actually, I thought
it was all a result of my stress.

362
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:45,333
But it wasn't.

363
00:39:46,082 --> 00:39:50,783
The same thing happened
with an old man's body.

364
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,110
He had been dead for two days.

365
00:39:54,984 --> 00:39:55,940
He woke up...

366
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:58,520
looked at me...

367
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:01,016
and talked to me.

368
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:08,421
I...

369
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:11,541
made the mistake of calling his family.

370
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,082
The family went to the morgue.

371
00:40:18,212 --> 00:40:21,510
Can you imagine
what his son was going through?

372
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:26,814
But these things happen.

373
00:40:27,106 --> 00:40:31,365
They happen when one comes across
things that don't belong in this world.

374
00:40:34,205 --> 00:40:35,291
I believe that...

375
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:41,095
we should let them go
and play them down.

376
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:44,853
At least, play down the importance
that we usually give them.

377
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:51,576
The dead old man
blamed his own son for his death.

378
00:40:54,624 --> 00:40:57,255
- I believe I have read your book.
- Really?

379
00:40:58,424 --> 00:41:00,470
It was very well bound.

380
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:52,416
Pardon me, why do you think
these pictures--

381
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,503
They are genuine.

382
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,386
Didn't cross the country for
photos of uncertain origin.

383
00:41:57,469 --> 00:42:02,480
I'm not saying that,
but it's a striking coincidence.

384
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:05,194
Maybe it's not a coincidence.

385
00:42:06,614 --> 00:42:07,533
Mom!

386
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:15,550
Someone got in.

387
00:42:28,244 --> 00:42:29,748
We have to move the body.

388
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:34,007
PATRICIO NAVARRO
COMMUNICATION NOTEBOOK

389
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:53,841
Nobody is going to believe that kid
when he tells this story.

390
00:43:02,903 --> 00:43:03,822
Just in case.

391
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:20,692
She's still asleep.

392
00:43:22,905 --> 00:43:24,742
Yes, but not for long.

393
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:26,580
We must move fast.

394
00:43:27,582 --> 00:43:29,837
I settled the cemetery issue.

395
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:33,553
We had to move him.

396
00:43:35,348 --> 00:43:36,267
Where is he?

397
00:43:36,643 --> 00:43:37,562
In the freezer.

398
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:54,766
Unplug it, Jano.

399
00:44:03,409 --> 00:44:05,247
Holy shit, Jano!

400
00:44:10,592 --> 00:44:13,390
We'll have to carry him with the freezer.

401
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,066
You'll have to cooperate with us
if you don't want this to happen again.

402
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fortunately, we have
the superintendent's approval.

403
00:44:33,892 --> 00:44:35,521
But that's not enough.

404
00:44:36,189 --> 00:44:38,027
We have to move forward

405
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:41,326
and for that, we need you to sign
some authorizations.

406
00:44:41,951 --> 00:44:44,540
We'll need your house.

407
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:47,129
I mean, to spend some nights there.

408
00:44:47,714 --> 00:44:50,136
But you have to authorize us.

409
00:44:52,683 --> 00:44:53,560
What for?

410
00:44:54,312 --> 00:44:56,316
To investigate, Mr. Blumetti.

411
00:44:56,399 --> 00:45:00,659
There have been some paranormal events
occurring in a same radio.

412
00:45:01,077 --> 00:45:03,289
And one of the vectors is your house.

413
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:05,628
Your neighbors have given us
their approval,

414
00:45:05,711 --> 00:45:07,298
we are only missing yours now.

415
00:45:19,032 --> 00:45:20,452
Thank you, Mr. Blumetti.

416
00:45:22,164 --> 00:45:23,417
What does this mean?

417
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:27,968
This means that we are going to divide us

418
00:45:28,511 --> 00:45:33,230
in each of the houses where we believe
the paranormal events are happening.

419
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:39,118
Fortunately, Dr. Rosentok
is giving us his invaluable help.

420
00:45:40,788 --> 00:45:42,500
He's a colleague of Dr. Albreck's

421
00:45:42,584 --> 00:45:45,548
and has dealt with similar cases
in the United States

422
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:47,177
and all across the continent.

423
00:45:51,436 --> 00:45:54,025
What happened to my neighbor Walter?

424
00:45:56,322 --> 00:45:57,867
There's no news about him.

425
00:45:58,827 --> 00:46:01,249
Nobody has heard from him in a long time.

426
00:46:03,712 --> 00:46:04,632
Well...

427
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:06,469
good luck.

428
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,681
I think you'll need it.

429
00:48:24,394 --> 00:48:25,726
You are...

430
00:48:27,516 --> 00:48:28,848
- Scared.
- That's right.

431
00:48:29,348 --> 00:48:30,222
Yeah.

432
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:32,969
That's normal.

433
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,218
I won't deny it.

434
00:48:36,716 --> 00:48:38,631
I won't deny it either.

435
00:48:40,046 --> 00:48:41,253
I'm also scared.

436
00:48:43,377 --> 00:48:44,292
Superintendent.

437
00:48:44,376 --> 00:48:46,457
We could enter without inconvenience.

438
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,538
Good. You search the entire house?

439
00:48:48,622 --> 00:48:50,620
There's no power for lack of payment.

440
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,659
I have connections.
I can ask someone to reconnect it.

441
00:48:53,742 --> 00:48:54,824
That's not necessary.

442
00:48:54,908 --> 00:48:58,155
It's better to have the lights off
to find what we're looking for.

443
00:49:00,153 --> 00:49:01,152
Okay.

444
00:49:01,693 --> 00:49:03,442
I see. Sure.

445
00:49:04,815 --> 00:49:06,190
We'll be in touch then.

446
00:49:15,057 --> 00:49:16,221
Rosentok?

447
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:24,256
Could you specifically tell me
what we may find here?

448
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,712
Noises.

449
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:30,875
Some clues about what happened that night.

450
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:32,207
A few days ago.

451
00:49:35,371 --> 00:49:36,412
You mean...

452
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:39,743
just that, right?

453
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:46,611
You don't have to spend the night here
if you don't want to.

454
00:49:53,563 --> 00:49:55,769
Fear is...

455
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,018
con--

456
00:49:59,058 --> 00:50:01,056
- Contagious.
- Right.

457
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:10,464
I have a problem, you know?

458
00:50:11,672 --> 00:50:14,044
I take anticoagulants.

459
00:50:14,169 --> 00:50:15,002
You know?

460
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:21,829
And besides, I'm practically deaf.

461
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:23,161
I mean...

462
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:32,777
So, this is not the right place for you.

463
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:49,630
Hello?

464
00:50:51,253 --> 00:50:52,169
Hello!

465
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,248
Is that you, Albreck?

466
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:58,746
Hello.

467
00:50:58,996 --> 00:51:00,203
Yes, I can hear you.

468
00:51:00,827 --> 00:51:02,784
Could I speak to Alicia?

469
00:51:03,284 --> 00:51:05,282
She's not here.

470
00:51:05,615 --> 00:51:09,153
She's been staying at her sister's house
for some weeks now.

471
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:12,900
I can give you the telephone number
if you want.

472
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:14,523
Can you write it down?

473
00:51:14,607 --> 00:51:15,522
Yes, tell me.

474
00:51:16,647 --> 00:51:18,437
Four, two, four, two,

475
00:51:19,228 --> 00:51:20,602
one, six, zero, three.

476
00:51:22,724 --> 00:51:23,641
Who's calling?

477
00:51:38,752 --> 00:51:40,917
Hi, Ali. It's Sarita.

478
00:51:41,124 --> 00:51:45,287
Listen, I'm calling you because
Patito came home without his backpack.

479
00:51:45,454 --> 00:51:50,325
He says he went to your place
to get some toys and dropped it there.

480
00:51:50,866 --> 00:51:54,279
Let me know if you see his backpack
over there. Bye.

481
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

482
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:18,716
It's weird, right?

483
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:40,571
Alicia, I need to talk to you.
It's urgent.

484
00:52:40,654 --> 00:52:43,568
Please, call me
as soon as you hear this message.

485
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:44,943
It's urgent.

486
00:52:45,942 --> 00:52:47,025
It's Sara again.

487
00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:50,024
Please, Alicia,
I've been trying to reach you for days.

488
00:52:50,108 --> 00:52:53,691
Patricio recorded something very strange
with his cellphone.

489
00:52:53,774 --> 00:52:55,774
He recorded it on your backyard.

490
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
He climbed the wall, as usual.
I don't know how to tell you this.
We're very frightened.

491
00:53:03,273 --> 00:53:06,855
You have to see this video.
It's connected to your son.

492
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:10,646
It's also connected to your ex,
the police officer.

493
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,687
I don't know what to do. Call me, please.

494
00:53:13,895 --> 00:53:16,019
I'll try to locate you somehow.

495
00:53:16,103 --> 00:53:18,811
It's very disturbing.
Call me back, please.

496
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:46,681
Hold on!

497
00:53:47,806 --> 00:53:49,222
Hold on, hold on!

498
00:53:49,347 --> 00:53:51,346
Let me help you!

499
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:53,096
The knife, the knife!

500
00:54:01,345 --> 00:54:03,344
It's...

501
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:08,552
- It's...
- Sucking.

502
00:54:08,635 --> 00:54:10,634
It's sucking my blood.

503
00:54:12,968 --> 00:54:16,342
There's something in here...

504
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:19,174
that's sucking...

505
00:54:40,087 --> 00:54:41,295
Don't shoot!

506
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:43,795
No, don't shoot!

507
00:54:45,795 --> 00:54:47,044
- What?
- Help me!

508
00:54:48,086 --> 00:54:49,169
Holy shit!

509
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:56,084
Funes.

510
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,792
Things are getting rough here.

511
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:00,542
Rosentok is injured.

512
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,250
- Tell her I'm fine.
- Injured?

513
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,666
He should get checked by a doctor.

514
00:55:09,748 --> 00:55:11,748
Albreck. Yes.

515
00:55:12,665 --> 00:55:14,497
We're on the right track.

516
00:55:16,622 --> 00:55:18,080
I'm glad to hear that.

517
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,079
I think we're at the niche.

518
00:55:23,162 --> 00:55:25,162
- Niche?
- The nest!

519
00:55:25,787 --> 00:55:26,954
Inside the nest.

520
00:55:27,036 --> 00:55:30,702
I'm glad to hear that too.
I'm pleased to have you with us.

521
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,619
I appreciate that.

522
00:55:33,952 --> 00:55:35,119
Talk to you later.

523
00:55:36,827 --> 00:55:38,451
You should clean the blood.

524
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:43,492
It will take some time
for the painkiller to take effect.

525
00:55:44,616 --> 00:55:51,032
Meanwhile, you should
clean the blood that we left in the house.

526
00:55:51,157 --> 00:55:52,157
Me?

527
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:55,948
- Why do I have to?
- We don't have time to waste!

528
00:55:56,031 --> 00:55:58,614
Time goes by quickly here.

529

THIS NOTEBOOK

SCHOOL No. 28, THIRD GRADE

531
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:03,477
Hello?

532
00:57:03,893 --> 00:57:05,976
Jano, I'm out of this. I'm leaving.

533
00:57:07,226 --> 00:57:08,725
That's okay, don't worry.

534
00:57:08,934 --> 00:57:14,557
I'm so sorry, but you know,
I'm not good at this.

535
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:16,058
It's okay, I get it.

536
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:19,723
I have to be honest. I'm shit-scared.

537
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:21,807
And you know about my issues.

538
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:23,889
I've seen some things here

539
00:57:24,014 --> 00:57:28,055
that don't have any explanation,
at least to me.

540
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,514
Do you understand?

541
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:30,721
- Funes.
- What?

542
00:57:31,638 --> 00:57:32,638
Where are you?

543
00:57:32,721 --> 00:57:35,678
I'm here. Where else could I be?

544
00:57:36,512 --> 00:57:38,261
Which part of the house?

545
00:57:39,345 --> 00:57:40,469
In the kitchen.

546
00:57:40,552 --> 00:57:42,552
Jano, what the hell is going on?

547
00:57:42,636 --> 00:57:45,094
There's a man by the window.
It isn't you, right?

548
00:57:49,176 --> 00:57:51,009
What the fuck are you talking about?

549
00:57:52,717 --> 00:57:55,175
You're right. It's not in the kitchen.

550
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,716
It's in the next room, but--

551
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,599
Where is it, Jano? Tell me.

552
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:05,368
There's nobody here.
What the hell are you talking about?

553
00:58:05,702 --> 00:58:06,705
Yes...

554
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:08,672
Yes, it's strange.

555
00:58:09,006 --> 00:58:10,930
- What is it?
- I don't know...

556
00:58:11,684 --> 00:58:14,904
I see him and I don't at the same time.

557
00:58:19,212 --> 00:58:20,216
Jano?

558
00:58:20,802 --> 00:58:22,851
Holy shit, Jano! Are you there?

559
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

560
00:59:13,505 --> 00:59:14,843
I'm leaving, Rosentok.

561
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,532
I'm out of here. I can't stand this.

562
00:59:20,866 --> 00:59:21,870
I had enough.

563
00:59:21,995 --> 00:59:22,999
There.

564
00:59:24,463 --> 00:59:25,467
Down there.

565
00:59:26,513 --> 00:59:28,729
- What happens down there?
- I found it.

566
00:59:48,054 --> 00:59:49,058
It's empty.

567
00:59:50,313 --> 00:59:51,317
Yes.

568
00:59:53,993 --> 00:59:55,708
But it's not empty.

569
00:59:58,427 --> 01:00:00,184
It's a matter of perspective.

570
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:03,196
There's more than just one point of view.

571
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:29,882
Darkness and light.

572
01:00:31,471 --> 01:00:37,244
Two different realities in the same space
and time.

573
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:38,833
Darkness and light.

574
01:00:45,986 --> 01:00:48,077
Holy shit!
What the fuck is that, Rosentok?

575
01:00:48,161 --> 01:00:49,708
What the hell is that?

576
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:51,506
Fucking hell! It's moving.

577
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

578
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:35,761
Yes, Doctor?

579
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:39,358
Mrs. Albreck, it's what I was looking for.

580
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,038
I'm really glad to hear
that your trip was not pointless.

581
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,928
I always thought this was connected
to what you were looking for.

582
01:01:47,262 --> 01:01:48,266
Yes, it is.

583
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:51,195
And now? What should we do?

584
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,370
I have no idea, Mrs. Albreck.

585
01:01:53,621 --> 01:01:56,590
We should try to register
everything we can.

586
01:01:56,925 --> 01:01:57,929
Okay.

587
01:01:58,138 --> 01:01:59,142
Jano!

588
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:01,694
Jano!

589
01:04:07,595 --> 01:04:10,689
Get me out of here!
I have glass on my eyes!

590
01:04:18,386 --> 01:04:20,520
Can you hear me, Mr. Carabajal?

591
01:04:23,113 --> 01:04:24,410
I'm Mora Albreck.

592
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:26,082
Do you hear me?

593
01:04:28,341 --> 01:04:29,345
Dr. Albreck,

594
01:04:31,102 --> 01:04:32,356
it's my friend, Jano.

595
01:04:33,235 --> 01:04:34,239
He's not well.

596
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:38,714
- He needs help.
- Are you feeling okay?

597
01:04:39,049 --> 01:04:40,053
No, I'm not.

598
01:04:40,136 --> 01:04:43,524
Calm down. And don't you trust
everything you see tonight.

599
01:04:44,362 --> 01:04:46,327
He was inside a cupboard, knocking at it.

600
01:04:46,703 --> 01:04:47,958
He wanted me to help him.

601
01:04:48,042 --> 01:04:51,127
I broke the cupboard to get him out,
but I couldn't.

602
01:04:51,336 --> 01:04:52,753
- I couldn't.
- I'll say it again.

603
01:04:52,836 --> 01:04:55,296
Tonight, you may see things
that are not real.

604
01:04:55,755 --> 01:04:58,840
This blood is not mine.

605
01:04:59,341 --> 01:05:01,342
I didn't injure myself.

606
01:05:01,425 --> 01:05:03,677
This blood belongs to my friend Jano.

607
01:05:04,135 --> 01:05:07,763
And there's some blood
that belongs to Rosentok.

608
01:05:07,846 --> 01:05:09,722
Isn't this blood real?

609
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:11,516
Wash your hands.

610
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:12,599
Come on, do it!

611
01:05:13,016 --> 01:05:15,893
You mustn't have blood on your hands,
not here.

612
01:05:20,437 --> 01:05:22,022
These beings like blood.

613
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:26,400
Have you used running water tonight?

614
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:32,570
I must go.

615
01:05:34,238 --> 01:05:35,698
I must get out of here.

616
01:05:37,156 --> 01:05:38,199
Dr. Rosentok?

617
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:39,991
Are you there?

618
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:44,328
We have to abandon the investigation.

619
01:05:45,578 --> 01:05:46,955
Do you hear me, Doctor?

620
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,373
We are too exposed.

621
01:05:50,165 --> 01:05:51,833
There must be an explanation.

622
01:05:52,709 --> 01:05:53,750
Something.

623
01:05:54,418 --> 01:05:55,836
There must be something.

624
01:05:55,919 --> 01:06:00,088
- There's not much.
- I have to explain this to other people.

625
01:06:02,923 --> 01:06:03,966
There's a theory.

626
01:06:05,383 --> 01:06:06,759
I'll understand it, I promise.

627
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:11,595
We study dimensional planes
that coexist in balance

628
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:14,013
and are organized like orange segments.

629
01:06:14,597 --> 01:06:16,432
There's life in the two planes.

630
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:20,727
Water allows carrying microscopic life

631
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,437
and this life may gather,
nest or reproduce.

632
01:06:26,439 --> 01:06:27,897
It can use our bodies.

633
01:06:30,607 --> 01:06:33,568
I don't have any idea
what kind of beings they are.

634
01:06:35,485 --> 01:06:40,114
- Nor why the attack us.
- Is there a way to stop this?

635
01:06:40,822 --> 01:06:41,865
What?

636
01:06:41,948 --> 01:06:43,699
All of this you're saying.

637
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:46,868
No.

638
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

639
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,236
I had a heart attack.

640
01:12:04,613 --> 01:12:05,571
I'm not sure.

641
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:08,406
Please, help me.

642
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:12,117
We can't stay here.

643
01:12:13,868 --> 01:12:15,870
Get me out of here now.

644
01:12:16,453 --> 01:12:18,455
You made me look like I was crazy.

645
01:12:21,082 --> 01:12:23,917
You made me think
that it had been all a fantasy.

646
01:12:25,668 --> 01:12:27,044
You took my baby.

647
01:12:29,128 --> 01:12:30,170
And they saw you.

648
01:12:31,505 --> 01:12:32,465
I saw you.

649
01:12:33,424 --> 01:12:34,677
I watched the videos.

650
01:12:35,971 --> 01:12:37,305
I saw you hiding him.

651
01:12:39,768 --> 01:12:41,771
You tried to hide my baby.

652
01:12:42,522 --> 01:12:44,316
You wanted to hide him, right?

653
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:47,613
Why did you put
concrete over his grave?

654
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:50,368
Answer me. Why did you do that?

655
01:12:51,619 --> 01:12:54,457
I did it for you. I swear it.

656
01:12:55,793 --> 01:12:57,170
I wanted to explain it.

657
01:12:59,799 --> 01:13:01,552
To explain it to you.

658
01:13:02,887 --> 01:13:04,348
Take me to the hospital.

659
01:13:04,724 --> 01:13:06,852
Take me, please. Get me out of here.

660
01:13:22,585 --> 01:13:23,544
Get in.

661
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:33,560
I wasn't going to leave him there.

662
01:13:34,854 --> 01:13:37,066
I couldn't leave my baby in the cemetery.

663
01:13:43,868 --> 01:13:45,204
I could not leave him!

664
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:02,021
You still have time!

665
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,279
They are torturing us all!

666
01:14:08,406 --> 01:14:09,366
Funes!

667
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

668
01:15:45,308 --> 01:15:46,268
I hear you.

669
01:15:48,104 --> 01:15:50,107
Captain Funes, are you there?

670
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:54,739
I've been calling you for hours.
The police station is a mess.

671
01:15:55,657 --> 01:15:57,995
The woman came over, your friend.

672
01:15:58,412 --> 01:16:01,166
The child's mother.
She was looking for you desperately.

673
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:03,878
I didn't have an alternative.
I told her where you were.

674
01:16:03,962 --> 01:16:05,298
She was going to meet you.

675
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,386
I did everything I could to stop her.

676
01:16:09,429 --> 01:16:11,098
You weren't answering the phone.

677
01:16:12,809 --> 01:16:16,773
Captain Funes, the mayor was here.
You've put my career at risk.

678
01:16:18,861 --> 01:16:20,237
Do you hear me?

679
01:16:22,408 --> 01:16:25,078
I am in the neighborhood.
I'm looking for you.

680
01:16:25,579 --> 01:16:26,789
Your van's not here.

681
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:36,638
Enrique, do you hear me?

682
01:16:40,269 --> 01:16:41,772
Listen to me carefully.

683
01:16:42,481 --> 01:16:44,233
Get out of that place.

684
01:16:44,317 --> 01:16:47,238
Get out of there now, it's an order.

685
01:16:53,873 --> 01:16:55,877
Holy shit, Enrique!

686
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,881
It's an order. Get out of that place now.

687
01:16:59,466 --> 01:17:03,097
Tell me you're listening to me, damn it!

688
01:17:04,056 --> 01:17:07,061
I copy you, Captain.
I'm in front of Alicia's house.

689
01:17:07,144 --> 01:17:08,605
I don't see your van.

690
01:17:09,022 --> 01:17:10,608
Your friend Jano is here.

691
01:17:11,609 --> 01:17:14,823
I can't see very well.
He's standing in front of the house.

692
01:17:14,948 --> 01:17:15,991
He's being weird.

693
01:17:16,242 --> 01:17:17,494
- Very weird.
- Enrique.

694
01:17:17,577 --> 01:17:22,376
Get away from that place now.
It's an order. Did you get that?

695
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,799
Roger that. I'm leaving.

696
01:18:38,766 --> 01:18:39,723
Alicia!

697
01:18:40,431 --> 01:18:42,305
We have to go, Alicia!

698
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

699
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

700
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,638
Mr. Blumetti.

701
01:21:39,138 --> 01:21:43,927
This is Dr. Razoni
and this is officer Guzmán.

702
01:21:45,176 --> 01:21:50,133
I want you to know that this is
being recorded with your consent.

703
01:21:50,216 --> 01:21:53,880
And the testimony of the parties
will not have evidentiary value.

704
01:21:54,755 --> 01:21:56,754
On October 3rd...

705
01:21:57,296 --> 01:22:01,877
of this year at 6:40 p.m.

706
01:22:04,917 --> 01:22:05,875
Mr. Blumetti,

707
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:12,622
do you recognize these people
who visited you a year ago?

708
01:22:14,954 --> 01:22:17,911
- Yes.
- Do you remember their names?

709
01:22:18,994 --> 01:22:22,534
But you remember them talking to you.
What did they tell you?

710
01:22:23,409 --> 01:22:24,366
Yes.

711
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:28,240
They came here to help me...

712
01:22:29,155 --> 01:22:30,822
because they had evidence...

713
01:22:32,612 --> 01:22:34,237
of my wife's disappearance.

714
01:22:36,194 --> 01:22:37,151
What else?

715
01:22:38,235 --> 01:22:39,900
They made me sign documents.

716
01:22:39,984 --> 01:22:41,817
Yes, some authorizations.

717
01:22:41,899 --> 01:22:43,066
What else?

718
01:22:43,482 --> 01:22:44,524
I don't remember.

719
01:22:45,314 --> 01:22:47,438
I was very medicated at that time.

720
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:50,145
Do you know inspector Funes?

721
01:22:53,519 --> 01:22:54,477
Yes, I do.

722
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:57,433
Yes, he's a police officer.

723
01:22:58,017 --> 01:23:01,848
He had a relationship with
my neighbor, Alicia.

724
01:23:02,181 --> 01:23:03,597
Alicia Pérez?

725
01:23:04,014 --> 01:23:04,972
Okay.

726
01:23:05,763 --> 01:23:07,762
When did you last see Funes?

727
01:23:09,053 --> 01:23:13,301
I saw him the day of
Alicia's son's burial.

728
01:23:14,176 --> 01:23:19,548
Is there anything else about Funes
that you consider pertinent?

729
01:23:24,921 --> 01:23:30,377
He told me he was about to retire
and that he had some health issues.

730
01:23:31,917 --> 01:23:33,667
And that's it.

731
01:23:35,166 --> 01:23:41,121
Officer Guzmán is collaborating with us
and he witnessed how Funes

732
01:23:41,247 --> 01:23:44,328
set your house on fire,
with people on the inside.

733
01:23:45,535 --> 01:23:47,576
Inspector Funes is a fugitive

734
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:52,282
and we believe he may be connected
to your wife's case.

735
01:24:02,903 --> 01:24:04,902
Let's go back to your wife's case.

736
01:24:04,985 --> 01:24:10,066
It was stated that the officers found
fingerprints with your wife's blood

737
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:13,356
not only on the bathroom,
but also all over your house.

738
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:17,479
-This muddles the investigation--
-Him.

739
01:24:18,811 --> 01:24:20,102
Did he come with you?

740
01:24:25,433 --> 01:24:26,391
Who?

741
01:24:27,099 --> 01:24:28,058
Blumetti...

742
01:24:28,848 --> 01:24:33,721
we're investigating unconventional things
from the system's point of view.

743
01:24:38,136 --> 01:24:39,093
It's him.

744
01:24:39,635 --> 01:24:40,593
Rosentok.

745
01:24:41,218 --> 01:24:42,176
Yes.

746
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:44,758
It's not the same. His face is burnt.

747
01:24:46,924 --> 01:24:47,881
It's him.

748
01:24:53,378 --> 01:24:54,378
He came with you.

749
01:24:56,461 --> 01:24:57,418
Yes.

750
01:24:58,876 --> 01:24:59,876
He came with you.

751
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
