Yeah, we won't be touching

- Yeah, this'll blow up.

Yeah, there.
That one's supposed to be there.

DEBORAH: No, I have not.

129
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,338
- Always been a regret of mine.
- Mom, you went to Germany.

130
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,998
Remember?

131
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,168
- Well, that must, um...
- Remember?

132
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,507
Oh, must've been
a long time ago.

133
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,641
Well, but you were there.
You loved it. Remember?

134
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,269
The story of Alzheimer's
is never about one person.

135
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:30,183
My PhD thesis film posits
that this insidious disease

136
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,271
not only destroys the patient,

137
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,152
but has
a physiological influence

138
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,029
on the primary caregiver.

139
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,316
<i>Alzheimer's occurs when
abnormal protein fragments</i>

140
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,326
<i>accumulate in the hippocampus,
killing neurons.</i>

141
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,409
<i>The disease then creeps towards
the front of the brain,</i>

142
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,532
<i>wiping out neurons responsible
for logical thought</i>

143
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,334
<i>and problem solving.</i>

144
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,415
<i>It then assaults
the sensory region,</i>

145
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,706
<i>sparking terrifying hallucinations.</i>

146
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:58,298
<i>Eventually, it erases a person's
oldest and most precious memories.</i>

147
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,760
<i>In end stage, Alzheimer's
destroys the part of the brain</i>

148
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,799
<i>that regulates the heart
and breathing.</i>

149
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,435
<i>When swallowing goes,
death is not far behind.</i>

150
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,188
- DEBORAH: Take this one off.
- SARAH: Huh?

151
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,691
- Well, it's so military.
- What do you think?

152
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,772
Let's just... Yeah.

153
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,108
Wouldn't you agree?
I mean, you always look so pretty.

154
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,022
Whatever. OK, fine. Yep.

155
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,736
- Thank you. That's great.
- Gone.

156
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,401
Happy?
- I am happy-

157
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,285
Awesome.

158
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,287
DEBORAH: Is that
a shirt of your dad's?

159
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,416
I guess I would have,
you know, a senior moment.

160
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,498
Sure, you know, I'd put the toast in
and it would pop up

161
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,040
and I'd put the... push it
back down again or something.

162
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,924
Toast it twice.
Big deal.

163
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,336
On several occasions,
she left the stove on.

164
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,755
OK? Burnt up the spice rack,
the whole wall.

165
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,389
DEBORAH: If you remember
your grandmother,

166
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,015
she was frightening.

167

what we call MCI-

174

175

Through a battery of tests,

176
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,204
we were able to diagnose
with 95% certainty

177
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,207
that she was in the early stages
of Alzheimer's.

179

It's devastating,
obviously, for anyone,

180
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,421

to go down without a fight.
