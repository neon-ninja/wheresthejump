1
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,321
All right, kitty cats.

2
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,200
You ready to carve
the pumpkins or what?

3
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,800
- Hey, I was watching that.
- Sorry.

4
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,099
He wasn't watching that.
You weren't watching that.

5
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,250
Yes, I was.

6
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,090
All right then,
what was it?

7
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,600
A monster movie.

8
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,250
Fine, I'll put it back on.

9
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,599
Hey, Miss Witch, why don't you give
those fingers a rest...

10
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,300
and go wash your face.

11
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,379
I will.
What time are my parents coming home?

12
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,409
Uh, I don't know.
1:00? Hopefully sooner.

13
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,179
I get to stay up till one?

14
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,580
No, bedtime's at 11.

15
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,351
Stop eating all that candy.
You're gonna be up until tomorrow morning.

16
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,750
Very cute.

17
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,899
Your parents
owe me for this one.

18
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,330
You could slap him if you want.
I won't tell.

19
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,200
Oh, really?
I'll keep that in mind.

20
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,999
- What time is it?
- Oh, it's 10:50.

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,499
All right, seriously,
pumpkin carving in 10 minutes.

22
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,339
I wanna get this over with.

23
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,299
Yeah, come on, Timmy.
Get the hell up.

24
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,500
I'm not done
counting my candy, loser.

25
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,099
Can we just bury him
in the backyard...

26
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,600
and tell my parents
we lost him trick-or-treating?

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,150
Hey, look what I got.

28
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,200
What is that?

29
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
It's a videotape.

30
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,269
Where did
you get that?

31
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,130
Fell out of my bag.

32
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,070
Let me see it.

33
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,600
- Who gave this to you?
- I don't know.

34
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,500
You don't remember
who put it in your bag?

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,900
No.

36
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,100
It's creepy.

37
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,700
- What'd it say?
- It doesn't say anything.

38
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,300
Let's watch it.
Oh, absolutely not.

39
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,300
Why?

40
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,900
Why? Because God knows
what's on this, that's why.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,500
Only one way
to find out.

42
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,270
- Timmy, you're not watching it.
- Yes I am.

43
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,100
Timmy, stop being
such an asshole.

44
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,099
Hey! I said no.

45
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,999
It's my tape, I can do
what I want with it.

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,500
Yeah, well, I'm in charge of you
and you have to listen to me.

47
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,410
Let your parents watch it.
If they say it's okay, you'll watch it tomorrow.

48
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,610
No, I wanna watch it now.

49
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,300
No, you're not watching it.

50
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,299
Fine.
Let's put it to a vote.

51
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,400
I vote we watch it right now.
Tia?

52
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,299
Put it to a vote?

53
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,450
What is this?
The town hall?

54
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,690
I vote we watch it, too.

55
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,800
Little traitor,
now you're on his side?

56
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,239
What? I just wanna see
what's on the tape.

57
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,009
Two against one.
We win, put it on.

58
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,670
Do you understand
this is creepy?

59
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,479
Some pervert could have
put it in your bag.

60
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,179
Who knows what's on this?

61
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,800
Probably it's
just a scary movie.

62
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,000
If it's that bad, you can turn it off.
We won't tell our parents.

63
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,199
It can't be worse than the stuff
we see on the Internet every day.

64
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,219
You're gracious 10 years old.
What do you watch on the Internet?

65
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,850
You know what?
I don't wanna know.

66
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,659
Please.

67
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,500
We won't make you
carve the pumpkin.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,199
Fine, but you have to go
in the other room.

69
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,140
- I need to see what's on it first.
- Yes!

70
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,399
You too!

71
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,500
Ugh, this is retarded.

72
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,000
- Well, what is it?
- Well, give me a second!

73
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,440
Anything?

74
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,900
I don't see anything.

75
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,650
Looks like you
got hosed, Timmy.

76
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, wait a minute.

77
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,890
What is it?

78
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,300
Uh, I don't know.

79
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,850
This is stupid.
Come on.

80
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,200
Stop it! Excuse me. Who said the two of you
can come back in here?

81
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,299
See?
It's just a scary movie.

82
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,700
Let's watch it.

83
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,300
<i>Wait for the gate agent to give
your boarding announcement.</i>

84
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,000
<i>Check your monitors.
Thanks you.</i>

85
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,709
Fine, but if it gets out of control,
I'm turning it off.

86
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, yeah.

87
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,950
Oh, my God, it's great.

88
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,100
Um, girl.

89
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,550
Do you know when the train comes?

90
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,100
Uh, it should be about
10 minutes or so.

91
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,250
Uh, do you have
a cigarette? Heh!

92
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,000
No, sorry.

93
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,200
Yeah, thanks.

94
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,970
Well, happy Halloween.

95
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,650
Come on, let's go.
I need a fucking cigarette.

96
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,700
Come on.

97
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,650
<i>- Passengers, slow down train is delayed.
- Please stand by for further information.</i>

98
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,670
Please stop.

99
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
Ahh!

100
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,969
What are you doing?

101
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,700
Let me go. Help!

102
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,680
Help!

103
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Ah-a-a!

104
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,200
No! No!
Help! Help!

105
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,050
Help! Help!

106
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,500
Help!

107
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Help! Help!

108
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,600
Help!

109
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,600
Some help, would you please?

110
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,500
Come on!

111
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,200
Somebody answer me!

112
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,600
Please! Look!

113
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,200
Who's there?

114
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,749
Where am I?

115
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,000
What's happening?

116
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,600
Would someone
talk to me?

117
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,600
Please stop screaming.

118
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
- What's happening to us?
- This is where he keeps us.

119
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,250
There were three of us.
There was another girl.

120
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,799
What happened to her?

121
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,599
She was dragged down
into that tunnel.

122
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,200
They're pulling us down
by our chains one at a time.

123
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,700
Why are you two
just sitting there?

124
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,500
Why aren't you
trying to escape?

125
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,000
We've tried everything,
there's no way out.

126
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,750
Why is he keeping us here?

127
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,000
Why doesn't he just
kill us already?

128
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,900
Why are you doing this?

129
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,219
Let us go! Please!

130
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,000
Don't cry.

131
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,500
We're gonna die
down here.

132
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,500
Don't say that.

133
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,600
We're gonna get
out of here.

134
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,199
I don't want to die.

135
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,099
- Shut up! Just shut up!
- Kristen!

136
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,430
I can't take it anymore.
I can't... I can't keep listening to this.

137
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,199
She's just scared. Okay?

138
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,500
Help her realize...

139
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,830
I'm sorry.

140
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,600
We can't fall apart
on each other now.

141
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,500
We're all we've got.

142
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
What's your name?

143
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,500
Casey.

144
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,200
I'm Sara.

145
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,300
That's Kristen.

146
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,750
There has to be
a way out of here.

147
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,750
I told you, there isn't.

148
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,100
Then we have to go
down into that tunnel.

149
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,699
- What?
- We can't just stay here.

150
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,269
Going into that
tunnel is suicide.

151
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,099
Oh, and staying
here isn't?

152
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,100
What do you know?
You didn't see what happened to that girl.

153
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,899
We did. We watched her
getting dragged down into that tunnel...

154
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,499
and she was screaming
for her life,

155
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,999
and we were trying
to hold on to her...

156
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,159
but he just... He pulled her
right out of her hands.

157
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,900
We're not strong enough.

158
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,400
There's three of us now.

159
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,199
If we go together,
we might have a chance.

160
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,000
We don't even know
how many of them are down there.

161
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,399
What do you suppose we do?

162
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,209
The only thing we can do
is just wait here

163
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,650
and hope that
somebody finds us.

164
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,500
She's right, Kristen.

165
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,100
There's no other way.

166
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,580
No, Sara. Please.

167
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,400
You know I'm right.

168
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,199
Don't listen to her.
She's dead already.

169
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,300
Don't go!

170
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,899
There's no other choice.

172
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Don't leave me here alone!
He's gonna kill you.
Kristen, we have to, we can't just
wait here to see who's gonna...

173
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,500
Oh-oh!

174
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Oh! Oh!
Oh-o!

175
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,900
Oh, God.
It's got her.

176
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,200
Oh, my God.

177
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,250
Listen to me!
Kristen, we have to go now.

178
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,100
You hear me?
We have to go down there.

179
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,929
I... I can't,
I'm so scared.

180
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,699
I know you are,
and so am I,

181
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,800
but right now
I'm thinking about my family.

182
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,699
I'm gonna get out of here
and I'm gonna see them again...

183
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,899
and everything's gonna be
like it was before.

184
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,599
I know you feel the same,

185
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,980
but we're never gonna see them again
if we don't try to get out of here.

186
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,850
I can't stay here
anymore, Kristen.

187
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,900
I can't wait here to die.

188
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,800
I just can't.

189
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,160
We're gonna make it.
Do you understand me?

190
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,999
We're gonna be all right.

191
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,500
We stay close, and...
be quiet.

192
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,900
It's not further.
Stay right here.

193
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,500
Oh, God! Look, look, look!
You got it on the chains.

194
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,600
I think it's big enough.

195
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,750
Come on,
I think it's working.

196
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

197
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,000
Help!

198
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,300
No!

199
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,600
Oh, God!

200
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,000
All right!

201
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,000
Help me,
help me please.

202
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,740
There's something down there.
We have to get out of here.

203
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,000
Come on!

204
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

205
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

206
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,630
No!

207
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,250
Please.

208
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,600
Please.

209
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,450
Please stop.

210
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,700
Please stop.

211
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,900
Don't hurt my baby.

212
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,700
That was sick!

213
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,200
Okay, that is enough
for tonight.

214
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,640
Hey, what're you doing?

215
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,810
I'm turning it off.

216
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,800
It's too violent
for the two of you.

217
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,949
No, it's not.
We've seen way worse.

218
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,899
Then you should be punished.

219
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,900
You're too young to be watching
a baby cut out of someone's stomach.

220
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,499
- Come on, let's go. It's bedtime.
- Bedtime?

221
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,399
Yes, bedtime.
Tia, go wash your face.

222
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,200
I want the both of you
to brush your teeth.

223
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,399
- Man, it was just getting good.
- Aw.

224
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,150
I know.
I liked the clown.

225
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,999
Yeah, he was great.
I liked when he honked his horn at the lady.

226
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,199
That was so funny.

227
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,600
Yeah, that was hysterical.

228
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm gonna be up
to check on you guys in 10 minutes.

229
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,199
Hey, what's up?

230
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,800
<i>Hey, this call is to be sure
you're not dead.</i>

231
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,501
What is that
supposed to mean?

232
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,400
<i>Baby sitting on the Halloween night,
that's just asking for trouble.</i>

233
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,819
Yeah, tell me that it's already been
quite an eventful evening.

234
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,000
<i>Why? What happened?</i>

235
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,199
Some creep slipped a videotape into
Timmy's candy bag while they're trick or treating.

236
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,199
<i>A videotape?</i>

237
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,690
Hell, like a 1982 VHS.

238
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,399
<i>That's very twisted.</i>

239
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah, what you should see
with honest.

240
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,799
<i>Oh, God! What did you</i>
<i>subject those kids to?</i>

241
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,169
I got through.

242
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,799
Fucked up short film
with a clown...

243
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,200
and the devil
raping the woman.

244
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,000
<i>Sounds like my kinda movie.</i>

245
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,849
No, seriously, what
kind of sick bastard...

246
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,800
puts that in
a kid's candy bag?

247
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,000
<i>- Probably some loser who still lives
in his parents' garage?</i> - Probably.

248
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,599
<i>Don't sweat it!
Look at the seemed way it was.</i>

249
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,200
Yeah, that's what
Timmy and Tia said.

250
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,400
- Move away.
- I have to spit.

251
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,959
- I was here first.
- Get out!

252
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,100
You better move.

253
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,700
Now what?

254
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,069
That's it.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

255
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,869
Timmy, don't even!

256
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,770
Okay.

257
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,900
Timmy!

258
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,240
Hold on a minute, Dee.

259
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,200
What's going on up there?

260
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,299
Sarah, Timmy spit in my hair!

261
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,650
It was an accident!

262
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,850
Cut it out,
I'm calling your parents.

263
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,550
...reconsidering having children
at this point.

264
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,110
<i>Can you think of anything
better to do tonight?</i>

265
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,929
<i>How did Barbara ever</i>
<i>talk you into this?</i>

266
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,530
She never says right to anything.
What was I supposed to say? No?

267
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,729
<i>You're a good friend.</i>

268
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,030
Yes, I am.

269
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,970
Speak...

270
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,000
Speaking of good friends,

271
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,599
join me for a drink after this?

272
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,550
<i>Yeah, I can totally do that.</i>

273
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,240
All right, perfect.
I need one.

274
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,699
I'll text you
when I'm leaving.

275
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,619
<i>- Cool! Oh, Sarah...</i>
- Yeah?

276
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,720
<i>Don't get killed.</i>

277
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,989
Funny.

278
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,800
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

279
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

280
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,750
Little shit!

281
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,000
All right, let's go.

282
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,800
Is my tape in there?

283
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,999
- No.
- Where is it?

284
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,500
Downstairs.

285
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,350
Can I have it, please?

286
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,200
No.

287
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,500
I don't know why you're
making such a big deal out of this.

288
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,550
My parents are just
gonna give it to me in the morning.

289
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,049
All right, then,
the faster you get your little butt to bed,

290
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,600
the faster you'll
get your tape.

291
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,200
You suck, Sarah.

292
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,000
Goodnight.

293
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,130
Lights out, kiddo.

294
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,230
All right.

295
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,550
- You gotta come back.
- Are you gonna tell my parents...

296
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,400
that Timmy spit in my hair?

297
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,660
Well, it depends.
Is he gonna get in trouble?

298
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,499
Yeah.

299
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,739
Then absolutely.

300
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,250
Cool.

301
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,810
- Did you have a good Halloween?
- Yeah.

302
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,500
Did you get
enough candy?

303
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,180
I guess so.

304
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,600
You guess so?

305
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,500
Look at that bag, it looks like
you were trying to find the golden ticket.

306
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,800
Do you think
that clown was real?

307
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,700
See? Ugh, I knew this was gonna
come back to bite me.

308
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,000
No, it's just make-believe.

309
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,300
Demons, witches, monsters, that...
That doesn't exist.

310
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,599
But he wasn't really a monster,
if you think about it,

311
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,400
like a vampire or a werewolf.

312
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,500
He was just a man
in a costume.

313
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,199
Someone like that
could really exist, right?

314
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,800
Like a serial killer,
I mean.

315
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,500
What do you know
about serial killers?

316
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,199
See, you watch so much
stuff on that computer.

317
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,600
It's gonna
rot your brain.

318
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,600
I sound like my grandmother.

319
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,600
Listen to me,
the clown's only on
the video, right?

320
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,700
So if you don't watch it,
he can't hurt you.

321
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,000
And even if he could,
I wouldn't let him.

322
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,800
- You swear?
- I cross my heart.

323
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,170
Okay.

324
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,140
Time to go to bed.

325
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,080
Wait, Sarah.

326
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,980
Do you want me
to leave it on?

327
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,100
All right, sweetie.

328
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,900
If you need me,
I'll be downstairs.

329
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,600
- Okay.
- Okay. Sweet dreams.

330
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,400
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, sweetie.

331
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,500
Sleep tight.

332
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,949
<i>Does anyone up there know
why we're being attacked?</i>

333
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,900
<i>Whatever it is,
it isn't just happening here.</i>

334
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,200
<i>It's some kind of mass murder
that's going on everywhere.</i>

335
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,600
<i>- The radio said to stay inside...
- Radio?</i>

336
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,550
Radio upstairs,
I heard the news from it.

337
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,499
<i>There's a radio upstais,
and you boarded us in down here!</i>

338
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,499
<i>- I know what I'm doing.
- What did it say?</i>

339
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,800
<i>Nothing! Nothing!
They don't know anything yet.</i>

340
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,200
<i>But there's a mass murder everywhere,</i>

341
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,400
<i>and people are supposed to look for
a safe place to hide.</i>

342
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,150
<i>- Take the boards off that door.
- We are staying down here, Hellen.</i>

343
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,249
<i>Harry, that radio is at least
some kind of communication.</i>

344
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,800
<i>It is the authority to know
what happening with the friends.</i>

345
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,400
<i>People force that
they'll tell us what to do.</i>

346
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,999
<i>How we're going to know
what's going on...</i>

347
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
<i>if we lock ourselves
in this dungeon?....</i>

348
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,050
Timmy?

349
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,290
What do you want?

350
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,990
Can I sleep in here
with you tonight?

351
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,630
Are you serious?
Why?

352
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,480
The clown scared you,
didn't he?

353
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,100
I thought he was so funny.

354
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,240
Fine.

355
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,700
Don't hog all the blanket,
all right?

356
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,090
It's my bed,
I'll hog it if I want.

357
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,999
<i>First eyewitness accounts
of this grizzly development...</i>

358
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,469
<i>came from people who were
understandably frightened,</i>

359
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,000
<i>almost incoherent.</i>

360
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,450
<i>Officials and newsman</i>
<i>first discounted there...</i>

361
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,669
You know what we saw
on our property this afternoon?

362
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,800
<i>What?</i>

363
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,799
- A deer.
<i>- Get out of here!</i>

364
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,250
I'm not kidding.
It was only ten feet away.

365
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,299
It's really beautiful.

366
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,000
<i>Oh, that's so cute!</i>

367
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,000
I know, isn't it?

368
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,899
<i>That is a sign.
Deer symbolize peace...</i>

369
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,399
<i>in the beginning
of new adventure.</i>

370
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,280
<i>I think things are really gonna
work out great for you guys.</i>

371
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,900
God, I hope so.

372
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,000
You know, the hardest part is just gonna be
adjusting to this new lifestyle.

373
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,100
It's just estrange not hearing an ambulance
or a bus every two minutes.

374
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,599
I'm standing by my window,
you know what I hear...

375
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,000
outside right now?
Listen...

376
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,499
- You hear that?
<i>- No, what is it?</i>

377
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,900
It's nothing.
It's absolutely nothing.

378
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,400
You could hear a pin drop,
that's how quiet it is here.

379
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,499
You know what 8:00
in the city sounds like?

380
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,709
<i>Like stress?</i>

381
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,200
Exactly.

382
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,099
And at least here
I can just clear my head...

383
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,199
and John can focus
on his work.

384
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,800
<i>How is John, by the way?</i>

385
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,999
He's good. He gotta have his first exhibition
coming up in a couple of weeks,

386
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,999
Found just talking article really well.

387
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,999
That's really pretty careline.

388
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,250
<i>I'm gonna have to get my hands
on one of his paintings before he becomes too famous.</i>

389
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,299
Ugh, I wish you'd buy
his latest painting...

390
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,100
so I can get it
the hell out of this house.

391
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,060
Thing gives me the creeps.

392
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,999
<i>What is it?</i>

393
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's a face.

394
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,169
Just a horrible face.

395
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,000
Honestly, I just...

396
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,299
I can't even be
in the same room with this thing.

397
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,299
That's the furor.

398
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,200
<i>I didn't know
John painted things like that.</i>

399
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,000
He doesn't.

400
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,261
According to him,
he doesn't even remember painting it.

401
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
<i>He doesn't remember painting it?</i>

402
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,000
No, he swears he was
in some sort of trance or something. And...

403
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,589
all he remembers is waking up
from this terrible nightmare...

404
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,800
with this image
in his head.

405
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,900
And the next morning,
there's this painting in the living room.

406
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,750
<i>That's really strange.</i>

407
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,099
Yeah, well,
you know how artists are.

408
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,099
As my chopstick feels,

409
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,600
and I still can't figure out
how his mind works.

410
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,700
The owner of the gallery thinks that
it's gonna be one of his best sellers.

411
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,699
<i>Well, I hope everything
works out for you guys.</i>

412
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,541
<i>I'm really looking forward
to seeing the house.</i>

413
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,410
Yeah, you know, when we get settle here,
maybe you and Bob could come up for a weekend.

414
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,780
<i>- Sounds like friend!</i>
- Okay, Marry, I'll talk to you later.

415
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,080
<i>Bye.</i>
All right, bye.

416
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,000
Shit.

417
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,510
Fuck!

418
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,799
<i>We're sorry, your call cannot...</i>

419
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,830
Oh, fuck!

420
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,200
Fuck this.

421
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,469
Well.

422
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,580
Are you kidding me?

423
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,500
You can't be fucking
kidding me, come on.

424
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,620
Start!
Fucking car, start!

425
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,650
What?

426
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:24,019
Are you fucking kill me?

427
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,260
Oh, my God.
It's okay.

428
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,299
It's just a meteor, right?

429
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,599
It's just a meteor.

430
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,899
Just like
the one in Russia....

431
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,599
It's fine.
It's totally fine.

432
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,800
The electricity goes out,
nothing works.

433
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,740
You're gonna be fine.
It's okay.

434
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,200
Calm down.

435
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,610
Calm down.

436
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

437
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,500
What the fuck is that?

438
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,000
God damn it.

439
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,970
- John!
<i>- Hey, there you are.</i>

440
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:52,299
- Where are you? <i>- I'm headed back now.
I tried calling the house, but I couldn't get through.</i>

441
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,900
<i>- Is everything okay?</i>
- No!

442
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,800
Something landed
by the house.

443
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,999
<i>- What do you mean something landed?</i>
- Something land to the house. I don't know,

444
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,449
It's just a few minutes ago. It was just so loud,
I thought it was gonna crash into the kitchen.

445
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,789
<i>Was it a plane?</i>

446
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,799
I don't know.

447
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,659
I thought it was a plane or...
or a helicopter,

448
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,349
- but before we.
<i>- Before we?</i>

449
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,000
<i>You mean you can actually
see it from the house?</i>

450
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,899
Yes. It was only a hundred feet away
from the house.

451
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,199
<i>- Did you call the police?</i>
- I couldn't.

452
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,600
My phone wasn't working
until you called me.

453
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,769
<i>Call them. And whatever you do,
stay in the house.</i>

454
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,900
Okay, I will.

455
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,200
John, I'm really,
really scared.

456
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,949
I think there's
somebody in the house.

457
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:33,800
<i>Okay, calm down! There's no one in the house.
You're just getting spooked.</i>

458
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,299
<i>Listen, you'll be fine.
Call the police and then call me right back.</i>

459
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,749
I don't want you to go.

460
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,399
You have to call them.
You'll feel 100 times better
knowing they're on your way.

461
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,599
No, no. What if
I get off the phone...

462
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,759
and then I can't get in touch
with you again?

463
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,399
<i>Then don't call the police.</i>

464
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,099
<i>Worse case scenario,
just get in the car drive it to town.</i>

465
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,800
<i>You can stay at the Red Lion</i>
<i>until the power comes back on.</i>

466
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,740
I can't. The car's dead.

467
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,799
<i>What do you mean
the car's dead?</i>

468
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,199
I told you,
nothing's working, John.

469
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,600
There's something really strange
going on around here.

470
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,400
John?
John, are you there?

471
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,000
God damn it!

472
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

473
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,400
Ah-a-a!

474
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,100
Help, help!

475
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,780
Ahhh!

476
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,100
Ah! Ah!

477
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,650
<i>We're sorry, your call cannot be...</i>

478
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

479
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,939
- John!
<i>- Caroline, what's wrong?</i>

480
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,310
- I don't know what.
<i>- Caroline!</i>

481
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,839
<i>Caroline, listen to me!</i>

482
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,000
- It's at the door. Help me, please!
<i>- Caroline, hang on, hang on!</i>

483
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,400
<i>Caroline!</i>

484
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:55,500
<i>Caroline, can you hear me?</i>

485
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:57,720
<i>The police are coming.</i>

486
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,450
<i>Caroline!</i>

487
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:04,650
<i>- Caroline!
- No! John! Help me, John.</i>

488
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,900
John! No!
No!

489
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,900
John, help me!

490
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,600
John, help!

491
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,100
Ahh-a-a-a!

492
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,600
Ahh-aa!

493
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Help!

494
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,600
Help me, please, John!

495
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,500
Somebody help me!

496
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,030
Who makes this shit?

497
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,100
Why am I watching it?

498
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,300
Where are they?

499
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:05,360
Tia, Timmy, I told the both
of you to go to bed.

500
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,600
Don't pretend
like you're sleeping.

501
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,650
I told you to go to bed.

502
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:24,200
We are in bed.

503
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,099
Oh, really?
So it must have been someone else...

504
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,250
...whose own mischievous feet
running up the stairs.

505
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,350
What are you
doing in here?

506
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,999
She had a nightmare.

507
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,900
I didn't have a nightmare.
I heard a noise.

508
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,200
You heard a noise?

509
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,999
What kind of noise?

510
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,530
I don't know.

511
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,700
You can't describe
the noise?

512
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,600
Well, where did it come from?

513
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,500
My closet.

514
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,300
Your closet?

515
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,850
You always hear noise
that's coming from your closet?

516
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,839
Yes, she does.
This happens all the time.

517
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,009
Shut up, Timmy.
It was real.

518
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:00,480
There was
someone in there.

519
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,150
Maybe it's the clown.

520
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,399
Timmy, stop it!

521
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,080
Shh, listen!
I think I just heard his horn.

522
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,580
Stop it.

523
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,599
He's gonna drug you
and take you to the witches.

524
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,419
Timmy, knock it off.

525
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,700
Tia, listen to me,
we talked about this before.

526
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,400
There's nothing in your closet,
not a clown, not anyone.

527
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,099
And your parents
can be home any minute,

528
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,800
I want both of you to go to bed.

529
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,000
Maybe we could if you'd stop
checking in on us every five minutes.

530
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,400
What are you talking about?

531
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,800
I heard you creeping around
outside the door and turning the handle.

532
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,200
Just go to bed.

533
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,500
Hello?

534
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,700
Hello?

535
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,650
Right, Sarah.
You're watching too many scary movies.

536
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,200
Oh! This is ridiculous.

537
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:14,800
It takes a little gonna be scared
when I can't even convince myself.

538
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,369
<i>You're listening to</i>
<i>WORW 970.</i>

Hello?

547
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,000
Anybody there?

548
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Need some gas.

549
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,200
Fuck guy, dammit!

550
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,200
You're out of your
fucking mind?

551
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,460
Jason, you think it's funny, the piss
all over the place and smear your shit on the walls?

552
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,599
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

553
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,600
I'm giving you 10 seconds
or I'm gonna call the cops.

554
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,900
Hey!

555
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,000
I mean it.

556
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,999
So, what can I get you?

557
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,700
Um, filled up.
Regular. Cash.

558
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,199
So that guy really just
did that to your bathroom?

559
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,359
Uh, not my bathroom.

560
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,759
And I don't care if they fire me.
I'm not picking up someone else's shit.

561
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,390
Why didn't you just
call the cops?

562
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,050
What's the point?

563
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,169
He's already gone.
I'm just gonna have to fill out paperwork.

564
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:56,450
Supposed to be off
in an hour.

565
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,200
Yeah, but what if
he comes back?

566
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:04,300
Uh, I've got enough blunt objects
I can bludgeon him with.

567
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,250
He's lucky I didn't
fucking break his legs.

568
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:11,199
God, you really were low, huh?

569
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,000
Yeah, good thing I saw
your sign when I did.

570
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,189
I'm actually kind of lost.

571
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:17,800
Oh. Well,
where are you headed?

572
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,250
Um, New York.

573
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,520
I'm just trying to get back
to the interstate.

574
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:23,199
Um, you got
a pen and paper?

575
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,259
I can give you directions.
It's not far.

576
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,150
Oh, yeah. Sure.

577
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Where are you
coming from?

578
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,100
Um, Albrightsville.

579
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,709
I was up on
a movie shoot there.

580
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:41,279
Oh, you're in the movies?

581
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,699
Try to be, you know, independents, mostly.
Couple of commercials.

582
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,549
Is there anything
I would have seen you in?

583
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:50,250
Oh, I'm not an actress.
I'm a costume designer.

584
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,000
Oh, I've never met
a costume designer before.

585
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,000
Well, now you have.

586
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,259
All right. Uh...

587
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:01,899
- What you wanna do is
get back onto the 94.

588
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,350
You're gonna go
about six miles.

589
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,920
You're gonna see a bridge...

590
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,200
What was that?

591
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,600
Uh, hang on a second.
I'll be right back.

592
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,300

There's...

603
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,590
That's impossible.

604
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,000
That's fucking impossible!

605
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,600
Please! The killer's out here,
he's following me.

606

Oh, no.

609

Please, God.

610
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,099
Oh, shit!

611
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:30,250
This can't be real.

Halloween prank, is it?

I suppose not.
