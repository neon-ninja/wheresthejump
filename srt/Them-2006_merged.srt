Hello.

5
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,961
Yes, I picked her up.

00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,758
I know, I know.

7
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,560
Talk to her yourself.

8
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:11,763
Daddy wants to talk.
Quick, it's expensive.

00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:12,963
Sanda?

10
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,665
Can't you see I'm busy?

11
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,469
Take this phone!

12
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,373
He can call back.

13
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,672
Take the phone, I swear!

14
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,373
What?
You'll punish me?

15
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,747
Call us at home.
In a half an hour.

16
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:33,153
What's with you!
Why are you like this?

17
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,757
You need help.

18
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,358
Excuse me?

19
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,378
Sanda, are you OK?

20
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,946
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

21
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,365
What are you doing?

22
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,971
I saw someone.

23
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:25,669
What?

24
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,973
Someone was on the road!

25
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,673
Probably a dog.

26
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,952
Can't we go now?

27
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,670
Super...

28
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,661
Try the engine, please.

29
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,149
Try it again.

30
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,754
Mom, what do I do?

31
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,668

Here.

58
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,943
- My curriculum from last year.
- Thanks.

59
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,953
I had a hard time finding it.

60
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,554
Thanks so much.
It'll be a great help.

61
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,757
Are they that bad?

62
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,453
Not at all.

63
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,956
I need some time to adjust.

64
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:05,166
- How long have you been here?
- Nearly 3 months.

65
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,762
You're managing well.

66
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,672
I'd love to speak your language

- It's me.

What do you feel like tonight?

72
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,949
You.

73
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,250
That's all?

74
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,655
I wouldn't say no to some wine.

75
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,955
Wine, me...
Anything else?

76
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,757
Whatever you rummage up.

77
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,264
- How long?
- Half an hour, traffic's good.

78
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,459

- How are you?
- Fine.

81
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,948
What is it?

82
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,252
Nothing.

83
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,151
What's so funny?

84
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,959
- Hope it's productive, at least.
- So-so.

85
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,161
And you?

86
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,467

A dictation calmed them down.

88
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,366

Listen up,

90
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,045
you know a writer
never stops working.

91
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,244
Here, for example,
I turn off the computer.

92
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,946
I close the lid...

93
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,756
I stand up...

94
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,460
But in my head,
I'm still working.

95
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,258
Are you coming?

96
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,367
- And now?
- I'm working.

97
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,144
- And now?
- Still working...

98
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,952
- And now?
- You can keep trying.

99
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,047
- And now?
- Extreme concentration!

100
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,660
Shit!

101
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,262
You lose.

102
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,772
Can I come in?

103
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,253
Are you still there?

104
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,575
Well?

105
00:17:58,677 --> 00:17:59,371
It's delicious.

106
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,672
Really?

107
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,244
It's unusual, but...

108
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,148
It's interesting.

109
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,246
Unusual? How?

110
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,355
Particular.

111
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,465

112
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,367
Everything.

113
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,463
What do you mean?

114
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,667
I threw in all the groceries.

115
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,767
That explains it.

116
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,972
It's all-inclusive.

117
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,049
Starter, main dish, dessert...
From soup to nuts.

118
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,447
You don't like it?

119
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,145
- Yes, I do.
- If you don't like it...

120
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,951
- Fine, that's enough.
- Let's clear the table.

121
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,454
That's the way it goes.

122
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,052
- We're finished.
- It's not bad...

123
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,155
Get out.
You've hurt me enough.

124
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,066
- Are you sleeping?
- No.

125
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,275
Yes, you're sleeping.

126
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,677
I'm not sleeping.

127
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,552
- It looks bad.
- Really?

128
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,355
Really bad.
I think she's cheating on him.

129
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,952
That's unfortunate.

130
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,659
Want me to go?

131
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:33,965
No, it's my turn.

132
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,072
It's so annoying.

133
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,740
Are you going or am I?

134
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,249
It's alright. I'll go.

135
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,654
Doggy...

136
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,358
Doggy!

137
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,348
Here you are.

138
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,444
I thought you lost your appetite.

139
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,950
Stop barking.
It disturbs everyone.

140
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,654
Easy, easy.

141
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,457
That's it. Nothing left.

142
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,963
Go on.

143
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,366
Get lost!

144
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,442
The beast has been subdued.

145
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,345
Let's go to bed?

146
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,045
Come on.

147
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,556
Enough of this crap.

148
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,253
I'm exhausted.

149
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,056
Are you sleepy, Mr. Sleepy?

150
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,360
Aren't you sleepy?

151
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,368
- You're never sleepy.
- Never.

152
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,165
- How do you do it?
- I don't know.

153
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,970
- What's your secret?
- A little secret.

154
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,475
Tell me.

155
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,767
I'm going downstairs
to work a bit, OK?

156
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,958
This is such trash!

157
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,361
Who's on the line?

158
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,965
Who's on the line?

159
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,667
Who's on the line?

160
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,171
Who's on the line?

161
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,451

162
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,355
Lucas...

163
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,661
Wake up.

164
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,064
Wake up.

165

166
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,141
Didn't you hear it?

167
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,954
- What?
- The noise outside.

168
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,166
What are you doing?

169
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,565
Come on.
Let's go down and see.

170
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,249
Are you coming?

171
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,970
What are you doing?

172
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,473
- Nothing.
- Come on.

173
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,658
Why the hell's my car there?

174
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:29,970
Come see.

175
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,174
Do you see?

176
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,340
Don't be silly. I'll just check.

177
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,544
Stay there.

178
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,160
Anyone there?

179
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,265
Is anyone there?

180
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,138
Lucas!

181
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,340

185
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,348
Who?

186
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,458
Stop!

187
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,961
They came into my house.

188
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,259
No! I don't have them.

189
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,073
They're in the car!
