1
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,256
Are there any tickets left, please?

2
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,756
I'm awfully sorry, ladies and
gentlemen. I don't feel terribly well.

3
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,089
Please excuse me.

4
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,174
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to have to inform you

5
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,755
that Mr Bergson has been taken ill,

6
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,803
and will be unable to continue the recital.

7
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,424
He has asked me to apologise...

8
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:46,087
Yes?

9
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,786
You heard it too, didn't you?

10
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,621
That music, didn't you recognise it?

11
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,039
Who are you?

12
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,842
Yes?

13
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,420
Yes.

14
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,721
Worse than yesterday?

15
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,852
No, I'll come straight over.

16
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,866
My mother's very ill.

17
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,906
I must call a taxi.

18
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,489
My car's outside. May I drive you?

19
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,870
Yes.

20
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,053
Do you remember your father?

21
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,506
No. He died the day I was born.

22
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,842
You play like him.

23
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,179
You're too young to have heard him.

24
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,268
He did make recordings.

25
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,816
- I never heard them.
- Why not?

26
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,813
Perhaps because I want to play like myself.

27
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,066
His music had an uncanny quality,

28
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,576
as if inspired by some unseen power.

29
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,957
Divine Mozart?

30
00:07:30,323 --> 00:07:32,335
No, no.

31
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,876
You're wrong to mock.

32
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,086
This morning, I was observing
the sun's eclipse.

33
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,338
I'm an astronomer.

34
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,675
There was some extremely
violent turbulence on its surface.

35
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,765
It was as if the Earth,

36
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,934
or something from the Earth,

37
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,776
was drawing the sun's fire
towards us, like a magnet.

38
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,944
As I watched,

39
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,861
I kept hearing that music.

40
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,198
- Is she upstairs?
- Yes.

41
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,503
Would you wait here?

42
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,665
I'll make you a cup of tea.

43
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,765
Hello, Mother.

44
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:50,373
So much I want to say to you.

45
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,164
There's no time.

46
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,832
No time.

47
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,127
No more time.

48
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,478
She's come.

49
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,232
What are you saying, Mother?

50
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,442
She's here.

51
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:25,862
No.

52
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,819
No, let her stay.

53
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,288
Come nearer.

54
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,121
Come nearer.

55
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,997
Nearer.

56
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,049
Come nearer.

57
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,686
Nearer, nearer.

58
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,187
Find...

59
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,436
must...

60
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,404
must try...

61
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,122
Like as a father, pity of his own children,

62
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,581
even so is the Lord merciful
unto them that fear him.

63
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,008
For he knoweth whereof we are made.

64
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,094
He remembereth that we are but dust.

65
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,181
We therefore commit this body to be cremated,

66
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,636
in the sure and certain hope
of a resurrection to eternal life,

67
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,640
according to the mighty working

68
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,021
whereby he is able to subdue
all things to himself.

69
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,663
There, there. It's okay.

70
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,625
It's all right.

71
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,208
It's upstairs.

72
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,130
Now, would you like a whisky,

73
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,715
or would you like a Scotch?

74
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,341
Lovely.

75
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,151
It's all I've got, I'm afraid.

76
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,501
What did she say to you?

77
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,587
- Who?
- My mother.

78
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,339
Oh.

79
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,217
I could hardly hear her.

80
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,638
Something about the 'Master Magician'?

81
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,981
<i>Musician?</i>

82
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,561
The Master Musician.

83
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,110
He was somebody my father knew in Turkey,

84
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,860
who taught him special
breathing techniques for the flute.

85
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,240
He'd been having some trouble
with his playing.

86
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,364
After that trip, he never played again.

87
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,791
He became obsessed by fire.

88
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,371
And then, shortly afterwards,
he was found dead.

89
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,669
The lower half of his body
was really badly burnt,

90
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,545
and his fingers were locked
in a playing position,

91
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,423
with a flute between his lips.

92
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,492
<i>...Security Council calling

100
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,322
Hello?

101
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,282
Hello, it's me. Paul.

102
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,531
Did you see the news?

103
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,418
<i>A volcano's erupted in Turkey,
near the place where my father died.</i>

104
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,002
It's the sun. It's beginning
to affect the Earth.

105
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,091
I keep hearing that bloody music.

106
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,257
I had an accident on my way home.

107
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,800
I drove into a tree.

108
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,097
What?

109
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,849
You hurt?

110
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,431
No, I'm fine.

111
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,559
I thought I saw...

112
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,892
No.

113
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,110
Shall I come over?

114
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,656
Yes, I'd like that.

115
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,948
Look, I'm freezing cold.
I'm going to have a quick bath.

116
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,908
I'll leave the door on the latch.
Just let yourself in.

117
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,163
Okay? Bye.

118
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,153
Cat!

119
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,287
You hungry? Hmm?

120
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,339
Hmm?

121
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,526
Hello?

122
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,207
Anybody home?

123
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,018
- Oh...
- Hey.

124
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,101
Shh, shh, shh.

125
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:53,280
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

126
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,703
Cold.

127
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,747
Why don't you get in the bath?

128
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,036
Don't you want to know why your father died?

129
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,923
Yes.

130
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,216
And that music?

131
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,006
Yes.

132
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,006
Then you must find him.

133
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,632
Who?

134
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,266
The Master Musician.

135
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

136
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,950
You speak English?

137
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,074
<i>Parlez-vous français?</i>

138
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,077
<i>Sprechen Sie Deutsch?</i>

139
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,504
I'm looking for the Master Musician.

140
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,709
Musician?

141
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,976
Master Musician!

142
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:14,222
<i>Master Musician... Master Musician...</i>

143
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,225
These waters are the graveyard of the djinn.

144
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,563
They should not be disturbed.

145
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,357
You speak English?

146
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,651
My name is Bilal.

147
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,439
I summon the faithful to prayer.

148
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:50,155
I am told you are seeking the Master.

149
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,861
You heard?

150
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,203
Your flute will guide you,

151
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,788
as it once guided your father.

152
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,586
You know who I am?

153
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,913
You are your father's son.

154
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,463
He too came to seek the Master.

155
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,544
Where would I find him?

156
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,631
You shall meet him.

157
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,616
Look at these emission and absorption lines.

158
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,538
Aren't they unusual?

159
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,211
The peaks and troughs
look a little distorted.

160
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,299
Doesn't that indicate
the sun is becoming unstable?

161
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,800
The sun is a main sequence star. It's stable.

162
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,761
During its eclipse,

163
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:03,858
I detected an extraordinary
degree of turbulence on its surface.

164
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,060
I'm convinced there's a connection

165
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,688
with the recent volcanic activity in Turkey.

166
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,397
That's ridiculous!

167
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,150
There's no evidence.

168
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,072
Will you fund a visit to the volcano?

169
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,033
You're not serious?

170
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,624
I shall be taking some leave.

171
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,194
I almost ran over a woman on the way here.

172
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,328
- A woman?
- I think it was a woman.

173
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,992
Cloaked completely in black.

174
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,449
Except for her hand. I could see her hand.

175
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,167
It was really badly burned.

176
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,207
She was totally unaware of me.

177
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:11,297
And then, as she walked away,
smoke rose from her footprints.

178
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,503
You have seen a djinn.

179
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,588
A what?

180
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,890
The Koran has revealed
that the djinn was created

181
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,931
from the fire of scorching winds.

182
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,562
It can take many forms:

183
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:30,152
a snake, a scorpion, a beast of prey.

184
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:37,152
It can even transform itself into a man,

185
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,615
or a woman.

186
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,624
What is this place?

187
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,295
The Christians worshipped here
many centuries ago.

188
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,877
Your father wanted to be alone.

189
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,459
He chose to live here.

190
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:39,798
He believed it protected him
from evil spirits.

191
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,893
Don't be frightened. He won't harm you.

192
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,603
We call him the Silent One.

193
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,988
He's frightened of people.

194
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,774
He comes here to sleep.

195
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,611
You've had a long journey.

196
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,989
I shall leave you to rest.

197
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,916
And I shall come to you tomorrow.

198
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,510
She was there.

199
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,849
They were trying to kill her.

200
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,890
There is nothing there.

201
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,061
Why do I keep seeing this woman?

202
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,612
She was being stoned.

203
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,861
The woman was your father's wife.

204
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,778
My father's wife?

205
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,123
Your father married a woman here.

206
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,952
She was presented to him by the Master.

207
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,505
She gave birth to a deformed child.

208
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:34,924
Soon after, there were four infants
born dead in the village.

209
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,424
The mothers blamed her.

210
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,802
You mean that thing I saw last night was...

211
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,389
Your brother.

212
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,695
The Master.

213
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,775
- I must find him.
- No.

214
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,739
You are not ready.

215
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,665
Have you found him?

216
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,122
No.

217
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,918
But I've heard him.

218
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,009
Didn't you hear the music?

219
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,341
The music is created here.

220
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,011
Its source is fire.

221
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,933
You all right?

222
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,223
The sun's power is so strong,

223
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,472
it's damaging the surface of the Earth.

224
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:54,192
That volcano is the beginning.

225
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,029
Thank God you've come.

226
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,337
Paul!

227
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:01,964
It's okay!

228
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,463
It's okay.

229
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,974
He's harmless.

230
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,556
But he scared me, too.

231
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,063
Don't be afraid.

232
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,147
Don't be afraid.

233
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,151
I won't hurt you.

234
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,624
Don't be afraid.

235
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,995
Don't be frightened.

236
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:41,125
Don't be frightened. It's all right.

237
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,009
I won't hurt you.

238
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,765
Don't be frightened.

239
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:52,274
Ever since we arrived,
I've had the strangest feelings.

240
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,534
As though another part of me had surfaced.

241
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,991
It was quite uncanny.

242
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,040
And then this morning,

243
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,294
walking round this place,

244
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,177
I recognised everything.

245
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,091
Like recalling a dream.

246
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,146
Like I've been here before.

247
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,684
As if I were coming home.

248
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,204
But that village,

249
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,837
it really frightens me.

250
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,278
That's the mosque.

251
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,440
But no-one seems to use it.

252
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,794
Where is everybody?

253
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,798
I don't know.

254
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,259
This place is like a cemetery.

255
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,885
Who are you?

256
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,558
I must speak with Paul.

257
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,981
He isn't well.

258
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,079
He must learn to wield the power

259
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,123
that lies within him,

260
00:49:56,869 --> 00:50:00,044
and turn the flute away from evil,

261
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,130
away from the fire.

262
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:10,015
Otherwise, it will cut him down like a sword.

263
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:15,475
The fever is a warning.

264
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,603
It is the fire of the blood.

265
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:22,611
Through his music,

266
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,984
he must learn to control
the hidden forces of the Earth.

267
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,207
In the solitude of its voice,

268
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,298
a secret is hidden.

269
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:46,878
As long as he does not understand its power,

270
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:50,010
it can be stolen from him.

271
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,227
When he has regained his strength,

272
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,222
I will show him the way.

273
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,139
It's a locket.

274
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:18,772
My father.

275
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,571
And...

276
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,951
<i>Iblis inateçi.</i>

277
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,167
<i>Iblis inateçi.</i>

278
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:24,423
<i>Iblis ina... teçi!</i>

279
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:00,559
Where is she?

280
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,892
Her life is in the hands of the Master.

281
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:05,688
Where can I find her?

282
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,192
He destroyed your father.

283
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:11,566
Now you must destroy him.

284
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:15,570
Fire will become the Master,

285
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:19,740
unless you force him to
submit to the will of Allah,

286
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:21,996
to bow before Man.

287
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,374
How?

288
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,284
You have the power.

289
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,875
Your music must conquer his.

290
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,665
Master Musician.

291
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,337
What can I do?

292
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:34,679
You must enter the circle.

293
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:09,167
You must remain in it,

294
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,459
and search for the never-ending note.

295
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,925
You will be tempted,

296
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,224
you will know fear.

297
01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:24,767
Remember that the djinn can take many forms,

298
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,525
but the circle is your protection.

299
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,066
If you leave it before the will of the Earth

300
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:37,197
burns clearly within you, you will die.

301
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:55,755
The Master is dancing in his own blood.

302
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:06,725
We must act quickly,
or he will drown this Earth in fire.

303
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:26,283
# Allah, Allah, Allah

304
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:38,750
# Allah, Allah, Allah

305
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:59,604
# Allah, Allah, Allah #

306
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:20,863
<i># Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar</i>

307
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:29,259
<i># Allahu akbar</i>

308
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:39,391
<i># Allahu akbar #</i>

309
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
