1
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:28,758
Action, Jake.

2
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:36,206
Cut.
Look, what's the problem here?

3
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,917
Remember, I want you to open the coffin
a beat after you open your eyes.

4
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:43,350
Get him out of here!
Come on! Raise the camera!

5
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:45,073
Joe, give me a hand.
Something's the matter with him.

6
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:47,478
That's all right, Jake.
Just relax.

7
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:50,359
We got you. Something's going on.
Something's weird.

8
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:52,758
- Are you okay, babe?
- Give him some air.

9
00:01:52,823 --> 00:01:55,693
What's the matter? Speak to me.
Come on, talk.

10
00:01:55,768 --> 00:01:57,710
What's the matter?

11
00:01:57,783 --> 00:02:01,079
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

12
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:04,438
I was in the coffin. I closed my eyes.
I thought everything would be okay.

13
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:06,892
I opened my eyes, and the camera
was right on top of me...

14
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:09,553
and I couldn't move.

15
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:11,631
It's no big thing.
I just...

16
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:14,670
For a second there,
I just couldn't move.

17
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:16,750
I don't know what happened.
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:18,514
Fire!

19
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,438
No! What happened?

20
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:24,115
Get up there!
Put some water on it!

21
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:29,231
This is great.
That's terrific.

22
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:30,678
You got it under control?

23
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:37,078
Look, Jake,
you really look exhausted, babe.

24
00:02:37,143 --> 00:02:40,755
Why don't you take a shower
and go on home. We lost the sun.

25
00:02:40,823 --> 00:02:42,995
Let me try it one more time.
I can do it.

26
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:46,577
I know you can,
but we don't have any sun anymore.

27
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:22,191
Can I have nuts with that
and a Manhattan?

28
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:23,638
- Yeah.
- And fries.

29
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,077
- Right.
- Rings.

30
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:28,591
- Anything to drink?
- Two large Cokes with ice.

31
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:31,630
Onions on everything.

32
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:33,711
- That to go?
- Yeah.

33
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:35,955
4.99.

34
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:37,398
Keep the change.

35
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:40,431
You too.
See you guys.

36
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:47,314
- Scully, how's that picture coming?
- Good. Fine.

37
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:50,351
- Great.
- I'll have a Jack Daniels, neat.

38
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:53,391
Are you serious?
You quit drinking. Remember?

39
00:05:53,463 --> 00:05:55,318
Just get the drink, Doug.

40
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:58,354
What's the matter?

41
00:05:58,423 --> 00:06:00,430
They cut your big scene?

42
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:10,101
Again.

43
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:25,494
Carol?

44
00:06:29,143 --> 00:06:31,030
I thought you were a bartender,
not a priest.

45
00:06:32,503 --> 00:06:34,096
That's right.
I'm a bartender.

46
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:36,469
Then keep the fucking glass filled.

47
00:06:39,384 --> 00:06:41,238
Keep your own glass filled.

48
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:46,671
- I'm sorry.
- That's cool.

49
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:49,231
Just don't pay any attention to me.

50
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:50,677
l...

51
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:57,941
You need a place to stay?

52
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:01,718
Yeah, I guess I do.

53
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:33,010
What are you doing here?
I thought you were working.

54
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,933
I am. I got a week off.

55
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:37,235
I figured I'd go
to some interviews, stay busy.

56
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:41,231
- Great.
- Do you know about any sublets?

57
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:43,954
- I'II check around.
- Something available immediately.

58
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,991
- Not offhand.
- What... Ho!

59
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:49,714
The whole world's here.
You two know each other?

60
00:08:49,783 --> 00:08:52,434
- Jake Scully, Sam Bouchard.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

61
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:54,837
- Right here.
- I'll see you in class later.

62
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:57,390
- We got class today?
- At 3:00.

63
00:08:57,463 --> 00:08:59,830
- Right.
- Good luck.

64
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:02,034
What have you been doing lately?

65
00:09:02,103 --> 00:09:05,715
I just started a low-budget,
independent horror film.

66
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:08,434
'Vampire's Kiss."
I play the vampire.

67
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:12,434
Sounds interesting.

68
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:15,470
Before that I did Petruchio
in 'Taming of the Shrew."

69
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:17,234
Anything else?

70
00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:21,230
You mean anything good?

71
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:22,994
You are working.

72
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:27,373
- That's good now, isn't it?
- Yeah.

73
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:42,518
- Hi. Small town.
- Yeah.

74
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,234
- Jack Scully.
- Jake.

75
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:46,677
Give them hell.

76
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:50,677
Hello.

77
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:08,022
I remember that it was dark.

78
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,157
Really black.

79
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:14,671
I was just a little kid.

80
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:18,517
And the wall behind me was cold.

81
00:10:20,023 --> 00:10:21,550
And damp.

82
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:23,314
I was hiding. I was...

83
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:25,073
Oh, yeah.

84
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:27,150
I was part of this game: Sardine.

85
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:29,710
I was it, and I was hiding.

86
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:33,231
Everybody was looking for me.

87
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:36,598
And there was humming.

88
00:10:36,662 --> 00:10:38,834
I was behind the freezer
in the basement.

89
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:45,711
And I had jammed myself in
so hard behind the freezer...

90
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:48,500
that I couldn't move.

91
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:54,350
I'm afraid.

92
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:58,198
Uh-huh.
What are you afraid of?

93
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:01,813
They're not gonna find me.

94
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,206
But they're not supposed
to find you.

95
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:07,758
But I'm afraid
because I can't move.

96
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:11,312
Why don't you cry out?

97
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,470
I can't. I'm afraid.

98
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,754
Besides, I'm the sardine.
They're not supposed to find me.

99
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:23,473
Now particularize that.

100
00:11:23,543 --> 00:11:24,918
Who can't find you?

101
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:27,885
My brothers.
They're bigger than me.

102
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:31,954
First time
they ever let me play.

103
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:34,194
If they're your brothers,
they'll want to help you, right?

104
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:37,077
No. They won't let me play again.

105
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:40,077
- They're bigger than you are.
- Yeah.

106
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:43,151
Will they hurt you?

107
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:44,597
Yes.

108
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,834
How?

109
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:49,074
They'll laugh at me for getting stuck
behind the freezer...

110
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:50,572
and for crying out for help.

111
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:54,514
The big baby.

112
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,957
That's right.

113
00:11:57,623 --> 00:11:59,957
You are a baby.

114
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,677
I know.

115
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:06,518
Yeah, and you're afraid.

116
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,957
Yeah.

117
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:12,278
You must act.

118
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,917
I can't. I'm afraid.

119
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:23,088
- You'll never escape.
- I know.

120
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:25,877
You'll die.

121
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:28,437
Yeah.

122
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,794
Bullshit!

123
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:33,717
You've got to act!

124
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:36,309
Fuck the fear.

125
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:40,757
You've got to cry out for help!
Come on!

126
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:42,677
Use your body!
Cry for help!

127
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,389
You can do it.

128
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:52,052
I want you to cry out.

129
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,548
I can't. I'm a sardine.

130
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:56,491
Sardines in a can are dead.

131
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:58,671
They can't feel.
They can't be afraid.

132
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:01,263
But you're alive and afraid.

133
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:03,309
You're not a goddamn dead sardine!

134
00:13:04,343 --> 00:13:06,198
- This is crap.
- Dig down deep!

135
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:09,781
Cry out!

136
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,266
- I can't.
- Come on.

137
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:19,058
Leave the guy alone.

138
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:21,973
Do not interrupt this exercise.

139
00:13:22,038 --> 00:13:24,821
This looks like
a mind-fuck to me.

140
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,953
What is your name? You're not
a member of this class, are you?

141
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:31,061
That's right. I'm not.

142
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:33,712
I thought this was a class for acting,
not humiliation.

143
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,728
What gives you the right
to fuck around with this guy's head?

144
00:13:42,294 --> 00:13:45,872
- I think you better leave.
- I think that's a good idea.

145
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:48,912
I want to act.
Come on.

146
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:52,812
Class is out.
Come on. Let's go.

147
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,261
I'm sorry, Will.

148
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:56,661
I can't do this today.

149
00:13:58,647 --> 00:14:00,818
This is called an exit.

150
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:07,381
Shit.

151
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:11,695
What a fool I am.

152
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,694
You're too hard on yourself.

153
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:18,898
Some of these guys
can't get a job.

154
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:21,455
They put an ad in the trade.
They call themselves teachers.

155
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,934
What do they teach us?
How to be more fucked up than we are.

156
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:27,381
That's not it.

157
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,955
- Can we get another round?
- Coming up.

158
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:44,789
- Thanks.
- Check.

159
00:14:44,854 --> 00:14:46,709
Are you married?

160
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:51,861
Separated.

161
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:55,636
Me too, as of yesterday.

162
00:14:55,703 --> 00:15:00,492
We weren't married,
but it was almost the same thing.

163
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,941
What happened?

164
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,735
I'm sorry.
That's none of my business.

165
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,662
That's okay.
It's just...

166
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:11,697
Sounds so stupid.

167
00:15:14,006 --> 00:15:15,697
These things usually do.

168
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:20,432
Caught her in bed
with another guy.

169
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,997
Can you believe that?

170
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,445
Man.

171
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,932
You had no idea?

172
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:31,029
None.

173
00:15:33,206 --> 00:15:35,061
Christ, I keep seeing it.

174
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:40,497
Carol lying there.

175
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:45,297
Her face was glowing.

176
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:51,636
- Her face was glowing?
- Yeah.

177
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:55,477
How do you get
a girl's face to glow?

178
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:56,971
I got 16 years of good humping.

179
00:15:57,046 --> 00:16:01,301
Not once did I get a glimmer,
let alone a fucking glow.

180
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:02,741
Glowing?

181
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:09,139
- I'm sorry. That's tough.
- No, you're right.

182
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:11,378
It's not that big a deal, really.

183
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:13,934
- You kicked the bitch out I hope.
- I didn't.

184
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,494
- Why not?
- It was her place.

185
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:26,254
You've been through the shitter.

186
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:31,382
- Where are you staying?
- I got a friend with a floor.

187
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:41,301
You ready for some good news?

188
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:43,373
Yeah.

189
00:16:43,446 --> 00:16:45,454
I got this five-week gig coming up.

190
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:47,698
Seattle Rep's doing a revival
of 'Private Lives."

191
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:49,774
I've been house-sitting
for a friend.

192
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:53,294
- He gives me a good deal on the place...
- I've been looking for a sublet.

193
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:56,181
- Would this be available right away?
- Wait here.

194
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:58,897
Let me make a phone call.
Don't move.

195
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:04,974
- Do you like plants?
- Sure.

196
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:12,880
- I can't believe this.
- It's something, isn't it?

197
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:19,061
Be if ever so humble.

198
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,792
- This is unbelievable.
- I know it's not much.

199
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:26,896
- Can you handle this?
- I've never seen anything like it.

200
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:29,781
- Your friend must really be loaded.
- He's filthy with the stuff.

201
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:34,102
Anyway, here they are.
Water them every day after 6:00.

202
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,173
- Right.
- You got it?

203
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:39,542
- That's it.
- Listen, this is really nice of you.

204
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:42,738
No thanks necessary.
One struggling actor helping another.

205
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:44,497
- That's what it's all about.
- Thank you.

206
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:47,381
- Just don't let the damn plants die.
- You got it.

207
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:50,097
- Where is he anyway?
- Alan?

208
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:52,338
- Yeah.
- He spends a lot of time in Europe.

209
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,740
I got a well-stocked bar.

210
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,814
- Rotating bed.
- "Rotating"?

211
00:17:56,887 --> 00:18:00,662
Sauna and Jacuzzi in the back
just beyond the walk-in closets.

212
00:18:00,727 --> 00:18:02,996
As soon as I pack up,
you can put your stuff away.

213
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:05,451
- Are you leaving now?
- Yeah, l...

214
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:11,058
The hell with it.
I got time for one more drink.

215
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:13,777
I'll still be able
to catch the last flight.

216
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,781
What a setup.
This is great.

217
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,221
Isn't it?

218
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:24,662
Thank you.

219
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:27,061
- Sam, here's to a friendship...
- Wait.

220
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:31,541
Let's do this right.
Come here.

221
00:18:37,526 --> 00:18:38,900
To Hollywood.

222
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:40,341
Yeah.

223
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:46,097
What a view.

224
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:50,254
That's just part of it.

225
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:55,061
There is one very special feature
to this house.

226
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:59,054
- What are you looking at?
- Where are you?

227
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:05,908
There she is.

228
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:09,141
Show time.

229
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:16,973
I'd like you to meet
my favorite neighbor.

230
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,285
- See her?
- Whoa.

231
00:19:26,806 --> 00:19:28,181
It gets better.

232
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:33,941
- What's she doing?
- Just keep watching. You'll see.

233
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,689
- You want to get a little closer?
- You bet.

234
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,377
- Oh, my God.
- Focused?

235
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:43,789
- She's a little out of focus. Yes!
- Yes? Hang on.

236
00:19:46,327 --> 00:19:47,701
Does she do this a lot?

237
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:49,773
Like clockwork, every night.

238
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:32,437
Jesus.

239
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:30,100
What do you think?

240
00:22:34,006 --> 00:22:36,046
- It's something, isn't it?
- Yeah.

241
00:22:36,118 --> 00:22:38,093
Lady does the same gig every night.

242
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,654
Did you get a look at her face?

243
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,955
Too bad. She is gorgeous.
Shit.

244
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:46,095
- I gotta get going.
- Can I help you?

245
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,540
All right.

246
00:22:47,606 --> 00:22:49,297
Don't forget your scarf.

247
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:52,653
Here's the key.

248
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:55,060
Try not to make too many
long-distance phone calls.

249
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:56,817
Thanks again.
This is good of you.

250
00:22:56,886 --> 00:22:58,577
- You're doing me a favor too.
- Thank you.

251
00:22:58,646 --> 00:23:01,461
- Take it easy.
- Knock 'em dead!

252
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:03,860
They're already dead in Seattle.

253
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:05,301
So long.

254
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:14,576
My, my

255
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:16,021
Uh-oh

256
00:23:16,086 --> 00:23:19,698
The house is burning
but there's no one home

257
00:24:51,702 --> 00:24:53,077
Jesus!

258
00:25:03,382 --> 00:25:04,789
Bastard.

259
00:25:35,382 --> 00:25:38,197
Where the hell have you been?
I've been calling you all over town.

260
00:25:38,262 --> 00:25:41,393
I'm sorry, Frank. I've been having
some real problems with Carol.

261
00:25:41,462 --> 00:25:43,851
I've been staying
at a friend's house.

262
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:46,675
You got a few more problems.
Rubin fired you.

263
00:25:46,774 --> 00:25:49,774
- What?
- You dont have a job anymore.

264
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:51,788
He gave me some bullshit
about artistic differences.

265
00:25:51,862 --> 00:25:53,269
What the hell happened?

266
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:55,985
Nothing.
How can he do that?

267
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,614
They're doing it right now.

268
00:25:57,686 --> 00:26:01,003
Can't we do something?
Maybe I should talk to Rubin.

269
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:03,315
You better forget it.
They've already hired another guy.

270
00:26:03,382 --> 00:26:05,803
- How do you know?
- He's my client.

271
00:26:10,358 --> 00:26:12,692
Now bring them up.

272
00:26:12,758 --> 00:26:16,271
You're loving every minute of it,
sweetheart. It feels so good.

273
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:18,993
You're getting ready to take
a nice chunk out of the neck.

274
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:21,550
Hands down. Good.

275
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,477
All right, cut!

276
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,069
Kill the water and steam.

277
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:26,996
I thought you were gonna
give me another chance.

278
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:30,836
Look, I got a picture to make here.
I got 25 days to make it.

279
00:26:30,902 --> 00:26:34,349
I got no time to fuck around
with a claustrophobic vampire...

280
00:26:34,422 --> 00:26:36,593
who freezes every time
he lies down in the coffin.

281
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:39,629
- I'm not claustrophobic.
- Then what happened? Stage fright?

282
00:26:39,702 --> 00:26:41,556
I don't know.
It never happened before.

283
00:26:41,622 --> 00:26:45,396
It's never gonna happen again.
Good-bye. I gotta get back to work.

284
00:26:45,462 --> 00:26:48,429
- You promised me another chance.
- I lied.

285
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:50,193
- Don't you yell at me!
- Big fucking deal.

286
00:26:50,262 --> 00:26:51,952
- Get outta here! Beat it!
- Listen...

287
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:56,113
Joe, get him outta here! You don't come
in here yelling at me on my set!

288
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:58,189
- You don't have the right to lie to me.
- There's the door.

289
00:26:59,062 --> 00:27:00,753
Go on! Get out!

290
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:04,117
Get out the door, you fruitcake.
What's wrong with you?

291
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:05,589
- He's the boss.
- It's not fair.

292
00:27:05,654 --> 00:27:09,484
What's everybody standing around for?
Let's get back to work. Come on.

293
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:35,509
Just like clockwork.

294
00:28:06,262 --> 00:28:07,636
There she goes.

295
00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:43,949
Excuse me.
Could you move, please? Please!

296
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:45,680
I gotta go.
Thank you.

297
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:29,549
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Thank you.

298
00:31:39,382 --> 00:31:41,072
I have to see you.

299
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,792
What time did you call?

300
00:31:45,142 --> 00:31:46,996
I'm never home till after 7:00.

301
00:31:48,982 --> 00:31:50,989
Yes, he hit me again.

302
00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:58,189
I've got to talk to someone.

303
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,916
Today.

304
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,948
The Beach Terrace Motel?

305
00:32:04,981 --> 00:32:07,948
I'II wear something special.

306
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:09,396
You'll see.

307
00:32:14,102 --> 00:32:16,044
Yeah. Okay.

308
00:32:16,118 --> 00:32:17,492
Bye.

309
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:40,116
- Security, please.
- This is security.

310
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:42,996
Please come over to Bellini's.
I think we have a problem.

311
00:36:30,582 --> 00:36:32,108
Excuse me.

312
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:37,236
- May I help you?
- No, thank you.

313
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

314
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:13,555
Did you see that guy?

315
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,716
- It's the cream Mercedes.
- Wait here, please.

316
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,524
- Thank you. Here you are.
- Thank you, ma'am.

317
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:29,363
- Can I have my car, please?
- Yes, sir.

318
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,950
Thank you.
Right away. As soon as possible.

319
00:40:33,653 --> 00:40:35,922
Straight toward the beach,
down the stairs.

320
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:37,364
Thank you.

321
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

322
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:48,723
Hello?

323
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:54,707
Yes.

324
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:57,996
You've got to come.

325
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:02,605
I need to talk to you.

326
00:44:02,677 --> 00:44:04,106
I've got to talk to someone.

327
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:09,995
I need you.

328
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:10,483
Excuse me.

329
00:45:11,765 --> 00:45:13,805
Someone's following you.

330
00:45:20,116 --> 00:45:21,491
I know.

331
00:45:23,189 --> 00:45:24,716
No, it's not me.

332
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

333
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:03,596
Are you all right?

334
00:49:03,669 --> 00:49:05,043
He got away.

335
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,080
You got the purse.

336
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:11,444
You better check it.
He took something.

337
00:49:13,269 --> 00:49:14,643
What's the matter?

338
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:18,643
I'm just out of breath.

339
00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:23,756
Can you take me out of here?

340
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:25,203
Sure.

341
00:49:26,228 --> 00:49:27,789
- Here.
- Thank you.

342
00:49:58,389 --> 00:50:00,876
All right. Thank you.

343
00:50:00,948 --> 00:50:04,396
I feel much better now.
I'm fine.

344
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:08,244
I saw you back there
and at the hotel.

345
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:11,887
- You've been following me.
- Yeah.

346
00:50:14,228 --> 00:50:17,294
Why?
Did my husband hire you?

347
00:50:23,509 --> 00:50:24,883
I'm...

348
00:50:27,701 --> 00:50:29,075
What?

349
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:37,843
Yes.

350
00:52:05,844 --> 00:52:08,714
I can't.
I can't do this.

351
00:52:08,788 --> 00:52:10,163
Not here.

352
00:52:28,788 --> 00:52:31,505
Hello, Gloria.
How are you?

353
00:52:31,572 --> 00:52:34,322
Maybe you remember me.
This is Jake.

354
00:52:34,388 --> 00:52:37,836
I'm the guy that almost fucked you
at the beach today.

355
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:40,559
No, that's terrible.

356
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,618
Hi, Gloria.

357
00:54:16,852 --> 00:54:18,859
- Hello?
- How are you doing?

358
00:54:18,932 --> 00:54:21,266
Sam, how's everything?

359
00:54:21,332 --> 00:54:23,820
Great.
Everything okay over there?

360
00:54:23,892 --> 00:54:26,129
Yeah. No problems.

361
00:54:26,197 --> 00:54:29,874
How's our favorite neighbor?
Still with the midnight shows?

362
00:54:33,973 --> 00:54:37,234
- Uh-huh?
- You sound a little preoccupied.

363
00:54:42,932 --> 00:54:44,787
I just called
to see how things were going.

364
00:54:44,852 --> 00:54:47,340
By the way,
any messages for me?

365
00:54:51,253 --> 00:54:56,555
- Hello? Are you there?
- Yeah.

366
00:54:56,628 --> 00:55:00,621
I'm here. I'm sorry.
There are no messages.

367
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:04,492
Gotta run.
I'll be in touch.

368
00:55:16,852 --> 00:55:18,227
My God.

369
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,187
If you'd like to make a call,
please...

370
00:57:21,076 --> 00:57:23,050
Hurry.

371
00:57:44,692 --> 00:57:47,278
- Hello.
- Look out! He's right behind you!

372
00:57:47,348 --> 00:57:49,584
- What?
- My God!

373
00:58:27,892 --> 00:58:30,194
Stop! You guys, stop!

374
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What do you want?
Are you crazy?

375
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:48,463
- There's a woman being killed.
- What?

376
00:58:48,532 --> 00:58:50,222
Come on!

377
00:59:23,508 --> 00:59:27,185
L.A. City Emergency. This is 911.
What are you reporting?

378
00:59:28,212 --> 00:59:32,467
This is L.A. City Emergency.
Hello?

379
00:59:37,236 --> 00:59:39,309
I'm sorry, I cant hear you.
Please...

380
00:59:42,388 --> 00:59:45,585
Please tell me the nature
of your emergency.

381
00:59:52,948 --> 00:59:54,323
Don't.

382
00:59:58,676 --> 01:00:00,618
No. Please, don't.

383
01:01:44,148 --> 01:01:46,734
Get him off me!
He's killing her!

384
01:02:01,364 --> 01:02:02,738
Stop!

385
01:02:14,132 --> 01:02:15,658
God!

386
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

387
01:02:35,603 --> 01:02:38,156
I'm Detective McLean.

388
01:02:38,227 --> 01:02:40,333
I'm in charge
of this investigation.

389
01:02:42,771 --> 01:02:44,626
I see you're an actor.

390
01:02:49,843 --> 01:02:51,753
Yeah.

391
01:02:51,828 --> 01:02:53,682
Ever been in anything?

392
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:58,386
'Emerald Point" and a "Hart To Hart"
that was pretty good.

393
01:02:59,412 --> 01:03:01,102
Very interesting.

394
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:03,986
You make a living?

395
01:03:06,548 --> 01:03:07,922
Yeah.

396
01:03:09,043 --> 01:03:11,182
Good-looking boy.

397
01:03:11,252 --> 01:03:12,626
Talented.

398
01:03:13,747 --> 01:03:15,951
I got a real problem with you.

399
01:03:17,748 --> 01:03:19,176
What do you mean?

400
01:03:19,251 --> 01:03:22,600
I mean, you're my only witness
to this murder...

401
01:03:22,676 --> 01:03:24,531
and you're a peeper.

402
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:28,975
In my book, that's a pervert
and a sex offender.

403
01:03:29,044 --> 01:03:31,761
- What do you mean "a sex offender"?
- Save it.

404
01:03:31,828 --> 01:03:34,283
I ask the questions.

405
01:03:34,515 --> 01:03:37,483
What about this Indian? When he snatched
her pocketbook, you got it back.

406
01:03:37,556 --> 01:03:40,043
- Is that right?
- That's right.

407
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:42,004
Was anything missing?

408
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,923
I saw him take a credit card.

409
01:03:45,204 --> 01:03:48,303
Not a credit card, a card key.

410
01:03:48,372 --> 01:03:50,314
He used it to get into her house.

411
01:03:57,076 --> 01:03:58,734
Did Gloria know it was missing?

412
01:03:58,804 --> 01:04:01,106
She didn't say anything to me.

413
01:04:03,028 --> 01:04:04,882
You talked to her?

414
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on,
you must have said something.

415
01:04:17,011 --> 01:04:19,794
- It was just small talk, you know?
- No, I don't know.

416
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,715
Did you come on to her?

417
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,722
Were you trying to do a number
on her head?

418
01:04:23,796 --> 01:04:25,705
Trying to freak her out
with all you know about her?

419
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:29,260
- You're wrong.
- Why were you following Gloria Revelle?

420
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:34,796
Because I got concerned
when I saw that guy following her.

421
01:04:34,868 --> 01:04:37,737
But you kept on her tail
after this other guy disappeared.

422
01:04:37,812 --> 01:04:39,186
I know, because...

423
01:04:40,372 --> 01:04:43,983
- I guess I wanted to...
- You wanted to what?

424
01:04:54,707 --> 01:04:56,082
Nothing.

425
01:05:02,964 --> 01:05:04,338
What's this?

426
01:05:08,403 --> 01:05:10,640
Some underpants.

427
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:12,082
Yours?

428
01:05:14,163 --> 01:05:15,625
Where did you get them?

429
01:05:21,523 --> 01:05:24,076
She dropped them in the trash.

430
01:05:24,148 --> 01:05:26,155
- Who?
- Gloria.

431
01:05:26,227 --> 01:05:28,137
And you just picked them up?

432
01:05:29,811 --> 01:05:31,699
- Yeah.
- Why?

433
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:41,168
- I don't know.
- Tell the truth.

434
01:05:41,235 --> 01:05:43,788
You fucked her and kept them
for a souvenir.

435
01:05:43,859 --> 01:05:46,674
You didn't fuck her or you didn't
keep them as a souvenir?

436
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:50,088
- No to both of them.
- Are you just a harmless panty sniffer?

437
01:05:50,164 --> 01:05:52,400
- You got a dirty mind.
- That's a laugh.

438
01:05:52,468 --> 01:05:56,264
You peep on her, follow her, fuck her
and keep her panties as a memento.

439
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:59,209
Then you sit on the 50-yard line
and watch her being slaughtered!

440
01:05:59,283 --> 01:06:01,672
That's not what happened!
I tried to save her!

441
01:06:06,355 --> 01:06:10,217
Mm-hmm. Some save, Scully.

442
01:06:12,692 --> 01:06:15,659
Remind me to never put my life
in your hands.

443
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:22,194
Tell me about Alexander Revelle.

444
01:06:26,196 --> 01:06:30,255
- What?
- Alexander Revelle, Gloria's husband.

445
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:31,785
You knew him?

446
01:06:34,547 --> 01:06:35,922
I never met him.

447
01:06:38,068 --> 01:06:40,457
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

448
01:06:41,652 --> 01:06:44,335
Was he around
when Gloria got nailed?

449
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,689
Do you think he had something
to do with it?

450
01:06:49,428 --> 01:06:53,137
Gloria Revelle was a very rich lady.

451
01:06:55,188 --> 01:06:59,378
When rich wives get dead,
I usually go after the husband.

452
01:07:01,716 --> 01:07:04,618
The only problem is
you saw a thief.

453
01:07:04,692 --> 01:07:07,059
An Indian killed Gloria Revelle.

454
01:07:13,203 --> 01:07:15,789
I won't hold you, Scully.

455
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:18,675
We have witnesses
to back up your story.

456
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:23,024
But I want you
to think real hard about this.

457
01:07:24,051 --> 01:07:25,458
As far as I'm concerned...

458
01:07:25,523 --> 01:07:28,785
you're the real reason Gloria Revelle
got murdered.

459
01:07:31,123 --> 01:07:34,669
If you hadn't been so busy getting off
by peeping on her...

460
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:38,602
if you had called the police
about your blood brother, the Indian...

461
01:07:38,675 --> 01:07:41,425
Gloria Revelle would still be alive.

462
01:07:58,996 --> 01:08:00,370
Oh, yeah.

463
01:08:13,971 --> 01:08:17,746
Linda, we believe that you have
your own production company now.

464
01:08:17,811 --> 01:08:21,007
Yes, Linda Shaw Enterprises.

465
01:08:21,076 --> 01:08:23,629
What are some of those enterprises?

466
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:27,660
We have a film 'Deep Ghost'
and 'The Mating Game. '

467
01:08:29,364 --> 01:08:33,226
- 'One Night at a Time. '
- Yes.

468
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:38,537
I believe you have a film opening
this Friday at the Pussy Flick Theater?

469
01:08:38,612 --> 01:08:42,954
- What is the title of that?
- Thats 'Bold Obsession. '

470
01:08:43,027 --> 01:08:46,410
Tell us, Linda,
what is your 'bold obsession'?

471
01:08:46,483 --> 01:08:51,339
Sid, that script was written especially
for me, because I am an expositionist.

472
01:08:51,411 --> 01:08:54,128
You are an 'expositions'?
Do you mean an exhibitionist?

473
01:08:54,195 --> 01:08:56,562
- Yes, exhibitionist.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

474
01:08:56,627 --> 01:09:00,075
I just get so excited when I know
theyre all out there watching me.

475
01:09:00,148 --> 01:09:02,569
Of course
they're out there watching you.

476
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:04,782
- It gets me so hot.
- It does?

477
01:09:04,851 --> 01:09:06,738
What happens when you get hot?

478
01:09:06,804 --> 01:09:09,138
- It makes me want to come.
- You want to come.

479
01:09:09,203 --> 01:09:11,342
While you're coming,
lets watch this clip.

480
01:09:12,628 --> 01:09:14,995
Five minutes, Miss Body.

481
01:09:15,059 --> 01:09:16,433
I'm ready.

482
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,107
We've got five minutes.

483
01:09:22,772 --> 01:09:26,252
Eddie, where the hell are you?
We need you on the set.

484
01:09:26,323 --> 01:09:29,356
- Come on. Let's go.

Says Eros Magazine: 'The 'Gone
With The Wind' Of Adult Films. '

493
01:09:54,516 --> 01:09:57,811
'Holly Does Hollywood'

Yeah, we do. It's in our adult section.
Follow me.

01:10:50,644 --> 01:10:53,229
- On VHS?
- Yeah, VHS. Whatever you want.

Half-inch, three-quarter, Beta.

505
01:10:58,643 --> 01:11:01,578
- Is this what you're talking about?
- That's it.

506
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:01,515
- Hello. Adult Blue Films.
- I was wondering if you could help me.

507
01:12:01,588 --> 01:12:03,759
Are you the company that distributes
"Holly Does Hollywood"?

508
01:12:03,827 --> 01:12:06,510
- Yes.
- I'm not some fucking stunt cock.

509
01:12:06,579 --> 01:12:09,035
- I'm an actor.
- Youll have to wait.

510
01:12:09,107 --> 01:12:12,403
I have been waiting,
for more than an hour.

511
01:12:12,467 --> 01:12:15,369
Do you know how many pictures
I've made with Holly?

512
01:12:15,443 --> 01:12:17,418
Baby, I am sure
you have made a lot.

513
01:12:17,491 --> 01:12:19,346
I don't have to take this shit.

514
01:12:19,411 --> 01:12:21,200
I got a reputation
in this business.

515
01:12:21,267 --> 01:12:23,307
If you want to audition,
sit down!

516
01:12:23,379 --> 01:12:26,695
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

517
01:12:26,771 --> 01:12:29,105
- Can I help you?
- How late are the auditions going today?

518
01:12:29,172 --> 01:12:31,506
- Probably past 6:00.
- Thank you.

519
01:12:31,571 --> 01:12:33,262
You're welcome. Bye.

01:12:40,179 --> 01:12:41,586
Pleasure to meet you.

522
01:12:42,612 --> 01:12:43,986
Stand over there.

523
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:49,232
- You ready?
- Yeah.

524
01:12:49,299 --> 01:12:50,673
Go ahead.

525
01:12:53,651 --> 01:12:56,618
I like to watch.

526
01:12:58,515 --> 01:13:00,370
Makes you hot, doesn't it?

527
01:13:01,971 --> 01:13:03,345
Yeah.

528
01:13:04,403 --> 01:13:06,542
Makes me hot too.
Real hot.

529
01:13:06,612 --> 01:13:09,579
Come over here.
I'll show you how hot.

530
01:13:11,412 --> 01:13:13,746
All right.
Take off your clothes.

531
01:13:13,811 --> 01:13:15,666
I want to take some pictures.

532
01:13:21,331 --> 01:13:24,909
- What is it that we're watching?
- I don't know.

533
01:13:24,979 --> 01:13:27,914
Are you some kind of method actor?

534
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:39,026
Give it to me one time now

535
01:13:53,556 --> 01:13:56,141
Relax
Dont do it

536
01:13:56,211 --> 01:13:57,837
When you wanna go for it

537
01:14:00,211 --> 01:14:01,902
When you wanna come

538
01:14:04,211 --> 01:14:06,513
When you wanna suck to it

539
01:14:48,051 --> 01:14:51,018
But shoot it
in the right direction

540
01:14:52,051 --> 01:14:54,866
Make making it your intention

541
01:14:56,051 --> 01:14:57,993
Live those dreams

542
01:14:58,067 --> 01:14:59,823
Scheme those schemes

543
01:14:59,891 --> 01:15:01,899
- Gotta hit me
- Hit me

544
01:15:01,971 --> 01:15:05,037
Hit me with those laser beams

545
01:15:55,923 --> 01:15:57,778
I like to watch.

546
01:16:01,747 --> 01:16:04,300
Makes you hot, doesn't it?

547
01:16:04,371 --> 01:16:05,745
Yeah.

548
01:16:07,251 --> 01:16:08,777
Makes me hot too.

549
01:16:10,387 --> 01:16:13,321
Come over here,
and I'II show you how hot.

550
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:29,906
- Where's the come shot?
- Huh? Come?

551
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,906
The come shot. I thought we were doing
'Body Talk" here, not 'Last Tango."

552
01:18:39,635 --> 01:18:42,635
You were great out there. Really.
Come on, I'II buy you a drink.

553
01:18:44,211 --> 01:18:46,600
A drink?
I don't even know you.

554
01:18:46,675 --> 01:18:49,577
I'm talking business.

555
01:18:49,651 --> 01:18:51,025
Come on.

556
01:18:52,051 --> 01:18:54,385
You know the mirror out there?

557
01:18:54,451 --> 01:18:56,305
That was my idea.

558
01:18:57,651 --> 01:19:00,498
So, you're a genius.

559
01:19:00,562 --> 01:19:05,167
No, but I can make a better film
than Corso, with my eyes closed.

560
01:19:05,235 --> 01:19:08,137
Films cost money, you know.

561
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:09,585
I got money.

562
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:14,536
Then what are you doing in hard-core?

563
01:19:14,611 --> 01:19:16,105
I wanted to meet you.

564
01:19:17,523 --> 01:19:19,345
Why?

565
01:19:19,411 --> 01:19:23,185
Because I think you're sensational.
I think you're the best in the business.

566
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:25,771
I'll pay you top dollar.
I'll give you points.

567
01:19:25,843 --> 01:19:27,730
Whatever it takes.

568
01:19:29,202 --> 01:19:32,617
- Really?
- I want you in my picture.

569
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:36,585
- You're really serious?
- Yeah, of course I am.

570
01:19:36,659 --> 01:19:38,033
Okay, good.

571
01:19:39,731 --> 01:19:42,152
There are some things I like
to get straight up front...

572
01:19:42,227 --> 01:19:44,496
so there are no misunderstandings
later on.

573
01:19:44,562 --> 01:19:47,464
- I don't blame you.
- I do not do animal acts.

574
01:19:47,539 --> 01:19:51,281
I do not do S and M or any variations
of that particular bent.

575
01:19:51,347 --> 01:19:53,234
No water sports either.

576
01:19:53,299 --> 01:19:55,633
I will not shave my pussy,
no fist fucking...

577
01:19:55,699 --> 01:19:58,120
and absolutely no coming in my face.

578
01:19:58,195 --> 01:20:03,148
I get $2,000 a day,
and I do not work without a contract.

579
01:20:08,466 --> 01:20:10,354
Fine.
I mean, that's no problem.

580
01:20:12,818 --> 01:20:16,331
- I think we got a deal.
- Cheers.

581
01:20:18,131 --> 01:20:19,985
You ever do any specialty work?

582
01:20:21,843 --> 01:20:24,429
What kind of specialty work
are you looking for?

583
01:20:26,002 --> 01:20:28,523
A woman alone,
getting herself off.

584
01:20:30,419 --> 01:20:31,880
It's got to be really hot.

585
01:20:35,283 --> 01:20:36,657
Is that all?

586
01:20:38,035 --> 01:20:41,679
I have a routine that is a sure ten
on the peter-meter.

587
01:20:42,707 --> 01:20:44,846
- I know. I've seen it.
- Yeah?

588
01:20:44,915 --> 01:20:46,769
A few times.

589
01:20:46,835 --> 01:20:50,217
Yeah, I'm known far and wide...

590
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:52,560
for that little bit of business.

591
01:20:57,747 --> 01:21:00,081
I want you to know
I saw 'Holly Does Hollywood"...

592
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:04,206
and I think your acting
is top drawer.

593
01:21:07,634 --> 01:21:09,457
- My acting?
- Yep.

594
01:21:09,523 --> 01:21:13,581
You're fantastic.
Really. Sensational.

595
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:16,301
I'II tell you something else.

596
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:18,737
- You have got a terrific...
- Body.

597
01:21:20,243 --> 01:21:21,617
Smile.

598
01:21:25,331 --> 01:21:26,705
Smile"?

599
01:21:35,122 --> 01:21:37,424
Look at you.

600
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:40,174
- Kimberly, how are you?
- I'm fine, just lovely.

601
01:21:40,243 --> 01:21:44,465
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your friend?

602
01:21:45,938 --> 01:21:48,273
- Kimberly Hess. Hello.
- Nice to know you.

603
01:21:49,139 --> 01:21:51,244
So, Jake, you working?

604
01:21:51,315 --> 01:21:53,868
Yeah, here and there.
We have to run.

605
01:21:53,939 --> 01:21:55,564
- It's great to see you though.
- Right.

606
01:21:55,634 --> 01:21:57,544
Jake and I worked together
in the past.

607
01:21:57,619 --> 01:21:58,993
- Really?
- Yeah.

608
01:21:59,059 --> 01:22:02,321
I thought I knew everybody
in this business.

609
01:22:03,826 --> 01:22:05,233
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

610
01:22:05,299 --> 01:22:07,819
I don't see how someone
could know everyone.

611
01:22:07,891 --> 01:22:09,713
It's a funny business.

612
01:22:11,795 --> 01:22:13,705
Anyway, I wanted to ask you...

613
01:22:13,778 --> 01:22:17,226
have you heard of any roles
that might be right for...

614
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:20,266
- No, I'm sorry.
- I have. I have a tip for you.

615
01:22:20,338 --> 01:22:23,055
- Really?
- Yes, Simon La Farge is casting.

616
01:22:23,122 --> 01:22:25,064
- You know him, right?
- No.

617
01:22:25,138 --> 01:22:27,953
No? Are you from outer space?

618
01:22:28,018 --> 01:22:31,793
Just tell him that you ran into me.
Here's his number.

619
01:22:31,858 --> 01:22:35,470
You might want to firm up a bit
before you go and see him.

620
01:22:35,539 --> 01:22:38,987
One more thing.
Do you mind working with ladies?

621
01:22:40,979 --> 01:22:43,946
- Acting is acting, right?
- That's right.

622
01:22:44,019 --> 01:22:46,507
I think that's really admirable.

623
01:22:46,578 --> 01:22:48,433
Me, myself, I can't get into it.

624
01:22:48,498 --> 01:22:51,794
But, anyway, good luck
and say hello to Simon for me.

625
01:22:51,859 --> 01:22:54,477
- Good seeing you.
- Sure. Thanks.

626
01:22:54,546 --> 01:22:55,920
By the way...

627
01:22:57,651 --> 01:22:59,658
what's the film about?

628
01:22:59,731 --> 01:23:01,389
That's good.

629
01:23:01,459 --> 01:23:03,630
We need more comedians
in our business.

630
01:23:03,698 --> 01:23:05,127
Good luck.

631
01:23:09,939 --> 01:23:11,313
Very nice.

632
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:14,993
What can I get you?
Jack Daniels?

633
01:23:16,178 --> 01:23:18,993
How about Jake Scully...

634
01:23:19,058 --> 01:23:20,433
straight up?

635
01:23:21,938 --> 01:23:23,313
Very funny.

636
01:23:33,939 --> 01:23:35,313
Hello.

637
01:23:42,579 --> 01:23:44,106
Listen, Holly...

638
01:23:44,178 --> 01:23:46,033
I don't want to talk
any more business.

639
01:23:46,098 --> 01:23:47,473
Yeah, well...

640
01:23:47,539 --> 01:23:48,913
Listen.

641
01:23:48,978 --> 01:23:50,353
Lie down.

642
01:23:56,498 --> 01:23:58,986
We had one of these
in "Star Whores."

643
01:24:00,019 --> 01:24:02,507
There's something I gotta tell you.

644
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:04,105
You're married.

645
01:24:04,178 --> 01:24:06,033
- What then?
- I'm not a producer.

646
01:24:06,098 --> 01:24:07,953
You're not a producer.

647
01:24:09,619 --> 01:24:12,586
l... Hold up. I'm not...

648
01:24:14,099 --> 01:24:15,473
Just a second.

649
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:20,114
I'm not interested
in making a film with you.

650
01:24:22,258 --> 01:24:25,225
- What are you interested in then?
- You.

651
01:24:26,418 --> 01:24:30,193
I saw you in the house
those other nights.

652
01:24:30,258 --> 01:24:31,633
What house?

653
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:35,633
You know,
that show that you put on...

654
01:24:35,698 --> 01:24:38,349
with the masturbation routine
and all the diamonds and everything.

655
01:24:38,419 --> 01:24:40,274
I was watching you from here.

656
01:24:43,538 --> 01:24:47,564
You were the girl in the window.
That wasn't Gloria. That was you.

657
01:24:48,819 --> 01:24:50,226
What's it to you?

658
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:54,033
Just tell me if I'm right.
That was you in the Revelle house.

659
01:24:54,098 --> 01:24:55,473
Right?

660
01:24:57,138 --> 01:25:00,270
I'm not saying that it was me,
and I'm not saying that it wasn't me.

661
01:25:00,339 --> 01:25:03,437
I'm saying,
why are you interested in knowing?

662
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:14,826
I think that one of my crazy friends
has played a practical joke on me.

663
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:17,070
You know how it is
with the idle rich.

664
01:25:20,499 --> 01:25:25,387
Tell me, were you the girl
in the house?

665
01:25:25,459 --> 01:25:26,986
- Yeah, that was me.
- I knew it.

666
01:25:27,058 --> 01:25:29,873
How did this thing get set up?

667
01:25:29,938 --> 01:25:33,234
Tell me just to satisfy my curiosity.

668
01:25:33,298 --> 01:25:37,226
One of my crazy friends set this up,
but I don't know who.

669
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:38,672
Who hired you?

670
01:25:38,739 --> 01:25:41,870
- You were the one I was playing to?
- Yeah.

671
01:25:41,938 --> 01:25:45,233
- And there's no part for me.
- I'm sorry.

672
01:25:45,298 --> 01:25:47,470
- This whole thing was a joke.
- Yeah.

673
01:25:47,539 --> 01:25:49,394
It was a practical joke on me.

674
01:25:49,459 --> 01:25:52,426
Did Sam Bouchard
set this whole thing up?

675
01:25:52,498 --> 01:25:54,353
Did he hire you
to do your routine?

676
01:25:54,418 --> 01:25:56,589
He didn't tell me his name.

677
01:25:56,658 --> 01:25:59,954
Whoever you talked to,
what did he say?

678
01:26:01,458 --> 01:26:05,070
This guy called me up and said
he had seen my self-help routine...

679
01:26:05,138 --> 01:26:06,665
in 'Holly Does Hollywood"...

680
01:26:06,739 --> 01:26:09,870
and he wanted to hire me
to do it in private.

681
01:26:09,938 --> 01:26:14,193
He said that he had this friend
who got off on peeping.

682
01:26:14,259 --> 01:26:18,033
- He didn't tell you who he was?
- No. He didn't tell me his name.

683
01:26:18,099 --> 01:26:21,230
He just sent a messenger over
with money...

684
01:26:21,298 --> 01:26:24,113
and with a card key...

685
01:26:24,178 --> 01:26:26,185
and a wig.

686
01:26:26,258 --> 01:26:27,632
Please don't leave.

687
01:26:27,699 --> 01:26:30,994
Just stay here for a second.

688
01:26:31,058 --> 01:26:32,432
Can you hold on?

689
01:26:35,218 --> 01:26:36,745
- Hello.
- Lf's Sam.

690
01:26:36,818 --> 01:26:39,785
- How are you doing? Can you hold on?
- Sure.

691
01:26:39,858 --> 01:26:41,233
Hold on.

692
01:26:42,578 --> 01:26:44,269
Please, listen to this guy's voice.

693
01:26:44,338 --> 01:26:47,950
Tell me if he's the one
that hired you. Please.

694
01:26:48,019 --> 01:26:50,986
Hello. I'm sorry. You got me
in the shower. How are you doing?

695
01:26:51,058 --> 01:26:55,149
- I'm afraid I got some bad news, pal.
- What's that?

696
01:26:55,218 --> 01:26:57,390
Seattle Rep and I
had some artistic differences.

697
01:26:57,459 --> 01:26:59,313
I'm gonna be heading back to L.A.

698
01:26:59,379 --> 01:27:02,826
So I guess you'll have to find
another place to crash.

699
01:27:02,898 --> 01:27:04,273
That's him.

700
01:27:04,339 --> 01:27:06,673
- You got some company there?
- Actually, I do.

701
01:27:06,738 --> 01:27:10,186
It's kind of a bad time to talk.
You want to call back in 15 minutes?

702
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:13,553
- Yeah...
- That was the guy who hired you?

703
01:27:13,618 --> 01:27:15,309
- Yes, that was him.
- Are you sure?

704
01:27:15,378 --> 01:27:17,385
- Yes, I'm sure that was him.
- Listen.

705
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:20,906
- God, you're really sick.
- Listen to me very carefully.

706
01:27:20,978 --> 01:27:24,426
I am not a film producer,
and I am not a rich kid.

707
01:27:24,499 --> 01:27:26,025
No, you're a jerk.

708
01:27:26,098 --> 01:27:28,433
Holly, please listen to me
for a second.

709
01:27:29,938 --> 01:27:34,673
You were hired to do two nights' work,
to do your routine and leave.

710
01:27:34,738 --> 01:27:36,265
- Is that true?
- Yes.

711
01:27:36,338 --> 01:27:38,672
- Do you know why?
- You just told me why.

712
01:27:38,739 --> 01:27:41,553
You just told me some guy
was playing a joke on you.

713
01:27:41,619 --> 01:27:43,309
He wasn't playing a joke on you?

714
01:27:43,378 --> 01:27:46,193
- Do you want to tell me what it was?
- Yes.

715
01:27:46,258 --> 01:27:48,593
The truth.

716
01:27:48,658 --> 01:27:50,992
The truth is a woman was murdered.

717
01:27:52,818 --> 01:27:56,430
It's not funny. A woman was murdered.
You and I were set up by a murderer.

718
01:27:56,498 --> 01:27:58,505
He wanted to be sure
I witnessed the murder.

719
01:27:58,578 --> 01:28:00,433
That's why he hired you
to do your routine.

720
01:28:00,498 --> 01:28:02,832
Meanwhile, he arranged it
so that I would be watching.

721
01:28:02,899 --> 01:28:05,713
He wanted me to think that the girl
who lived there, Gloria Revelle...

722
01:28:05,779 --> 01:28:07,153
was the one getting off.

723
01:28:07,218 --> 01:28:10,349
Meanwhile, he thought I would watch
and keep watching.

724
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:13,069
Holly, are you listening to me?

725
01:28:13,138 --> 01:28:15,473
Yes.
I don't understand what you've said.

726
01:28:15,538 --> 01:28:17,709
Listen, he's a murderer!

727
01:28:17,778 --> 01:28:20,266
The man who hired you is a murderer!
Come here.

728
01:28:21,618 --> 01:28:23,112
Please, come here.

729
01:28:23,186 --> 01:28:25,008
Do you remember
where you did your routine?

730
01:28:25,075 --> 01:28:27,496
- Yes.
- You see that house down there?

731
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:29,545
- That window is where you were, right?
- Yes.

732
01:28:37,555 --> 01:28:39,943
- Now do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

733
01:28:40,018 --> 01:28:43,466
I understand you're sick and you're
a liar and you need professional help.

734
01:28:43,538 --> 01:28:45,545
- I do not like being yelled at!
- I'm sorry.

735
01:28:45,618 --> 01:28:47,625
I should have known when you told me
I had a terrific smile.

736
01:28:47,698 --> 01:28:50,033
No real producer would tell me that
in a million years.

737
01:28:50,098 --> 01:28:51,886
Get out of my way.

738
01:28:51,955 --> 01:28:53,809
- What?
- Just come with me to the police.

739
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:57,071
To the police? Are you crazy?
Listen to me, you weirdo...

740
01:28:57,138 --> 01:28:59,626
- A woman was murdered!
- I'm leaving! Don't follow me home!

741
01:28:59,698 --> 01:29:01,454
I have friends
who will break your legs!

742
01:29:02,578 --> 01:29:04,879
Let go of me! God!

743
01:29:04,947 --> 01:29:07,314
You weirdo!
There are so many weird people.

744
01:29:19,538 --> 01:29:22,059
Can I have the Hollywood
Police Department, please?

745
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:23,985
Fucking freaky actors.

746
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:25,708
That's what there is here.

747
01:29:25,778 --> 01:29:28,429
Masochistic directors.

748
01:29:28,498 --> 01:29:31,465
I should have known when he didn't
even know what a come shot was.

749
01:29:32,978 --> 01:29:34,986
Yeah, Detective McLean, please.

750
01:29:41,779 --> 01:29:43,950
Excuse me.
Stop, please.

751
01:29:45,138 --> 01:29:47,309
Thank you very much, lady!

752
01:29:51,027 --> 01:29:52,401
I was set up.

753
01:29:54,098 --> 01:29:57,415
Yeah, Hollywood's busiest
sex offender.

754
01:29:57,491 --> 01:29:59,345
Cut it out.
Just listen to me for a minute.

755
01:29:59,411 --> 01:30:01,385
I got something important
to tell you.

756
01:30:02,418 --> 01:30:04,174
I know who killed Gloria Revelle.

757
01:30:04,242 --> 01:30:05,835
Is this a confession?

758
01:30:07,058 --> 01:30:08,432
Listen.

759
01:30:09,458 --> 01:30:11,313
Just pay attention.

760
01:30:11,378 --> 01:30:13,800
A few days ago I was looking
for an apartment.

761
01:30:13,874 --> 01:30:17,070
Do you know any sublets
that would be available right away?

762
01:30:17,138 --> 01:30:18,829
I'll check around.

763
01:30:18,898 --> 01:30:22,510
I noticed this guy,
Sam Bouchard.

764
01:30:22,578 --> 01:30:25,066
He was looking for somebody
who needed a place to stay.

765
01:30:25,138 --> 01:30:28,433
I thought it was a coincidence
that we kept running info each other.

766
01:30:29,618 --> 01:30:31,757
Hi. Again.

767
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:35,623
Anyway, now I realize
he was throwing out a net.

768
01:30:35,698 --> 01:30:38,480
He was sizing me up
for a part that he was casting.

769
01:30:38,546 --> 01:30:40,586
I want you to cry out for help!

770
01:30:42,642 --> 01:30:44,016
I can't.

771
01:30:44,082 --> 01:30:48,904
I fit the bill perfectly:
lovesick sucker, out on his ass.

772
01:30:48,978 --> 01:30:51,084
Shit.
What a fool I am.

773
01:30:51,155 --> 01:30:52,977
And you know what the part was?

774
01:30:53,042 --> 01:30:54,536
I'm listening.

775
01:30:54,610 --> 01:30:56,944
The part of the witness.

776
01:30:57,010 --> 01:31:00,971
He told me there was this neighbor that
did this number on herself every night.

777
01:31:01,042 --> 01:31:04,010
- See her?
- He knew that I would look.

778
01:31:04,082 --> 01:31:06,090
- Nice, huh?
- Yeah.

779
01:31:06,162 --> 01:31:09,260
He knew I would keep looking.
And it wasnt Gloria.

780
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:11,981
It was Holly doing her routine.
Thats why I never saw her face.

781
01:31:13,618 --> 01:31:16,652
You sound like a conspiracy nut:
plots all around you.

782
01:31:16,722 --> 01:31:18,827
Please, just listen to me
for a second.

783
01:31:20,338 --> 01:31:23,502
Sam Bouchard is Alexander Revelle.

784
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:26,700
He hired the Indian
to follow Gloria...

785
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:29,640
and snatch her purse
and steal the card key to her house...

786
01:31:29,714 --> 01:31:32,299
and then sneak inside.

787
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:34,737
Then when she got home...

788
01:31:34,802 --> 01:31:38,632
the Indian opened the blinds
so I could see him kill her.

789
01:31:38,706 --> 01:31:43,408
Alexander Revelle set me up
in this house to witness the murder.

790
01:31:44,466 --> 01:31:46,670
He hired a porno actress
to be the bait.

791
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:52,494
Can I have a ride, please?

792
01:31:52,562 --> 01:31:54,417
Thanks a lot, you jerks!

793
01:32:04,338 --> 01:32:05,745
Oh, my God.

794
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:09,388
I've been trying to build a case
against the husband all along...

795
01:32:09,458 --> 01:32:11,313
but the reason
it hasn't panned out...

796
01:32:11,378 --> 01:32:15,120
is because of your testimony
that Gloria was killed by an Indian.

797
01:32:15,186 --> 01:32:18,000
That's just it! Don't you see?
That's what he wanted!

798
01:32:18,066 --> 01:32:19,789
It looks like a burglary,
but it's a murder...

799
01:32:19,858 --> 01:32:22,192
with me set up
to be the witness!

800
01:32:22,258 --> 01:32:25,007
I'm Alexander Revelle's alibi.

801
01:32:28,114 --> 01:32:30,984
Listen. Stop, all right?

802
01:32:31,058 --> 01:32:35,727
Just stop! Right there!

803
01:32:36,754 --> 01:32:39,143
There has been an accident
up there.

804
01:32:39,218 --> 01:32:42,513
- Those people are probably very hurt.
- Slow down, lady.

805
01:32:42,578 --> 01:32:44,716
- Nobody's bothered to stop.
- Get in the car.

806
01:32:44,786 --> 01:32:46,641
It sounds crazy to me.

807
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:50,545
I know, but it's the truth.

808
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:55,880
Maybe you better come down here.

809
01:33:12,594 --> 01:33:15,855
Pull it up. That's it.
Pull your car right up there.

810
01:33:17,490 --> 01:33:20,654
Stay in your car, please.
There's nothing to look at.

811
01:33:20,722 --> 01:33:22,762
We'll have it cleaned up
in a couple minutes.

812
01:33:25,969 --> 01:33:28,042
Get back in your car, sir.

813
01:33:29,874 --> 01:33:32,591
Officer, there's a woman being killed
in that Ford Bronco right there.

814
01:33:34,194 --> 01:33:36,780
He's killing her. He just hit her
in the back of the head.

815
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:38,508
We gotta do something
to help her.

816
01:33:38,578 --> 01:33:42,288
- Get back in your car.
- He's killing her. He hit her.

817
01:33:43,890 --> 01:33:46,345
- I don't have time to run you in.
- Please!

818
01:33:46,418 --> 01:33:48,458
He's getting away.
Please call somebody on your radio.

819
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:51,377
Don't you understand?
I saw him killing her!

820
01:33:51,442 --> 01:33:53,809
- You fucking idiot!
- All right, that's it, buddy.

821
01:33:53,874 --> 01:33:56,208
- You're coming with me.
- Call Detective McLean.

822
01:33:56,274 --> 01:33:57,965
- He knows all about this.
- All right.

823
01:33:59,474 --> 01:34:01,230
Son of a...

824
01:34:01,298 --> 01:34:02,988
Come here, you son of a bitch!

825
01:38:12,913 --> 01:38:14,288
Are you okay?

826
01:39:29,234 --> 01:39:30,761
Look what you did.

827
01:39:32,434 --> 01:39:35,401
You ruined my surprise ending!

828
01:39:35,473 --> 01:39:40,208
I gave you your part:
the witness.

829
01:39:40,273 --> 01:39:43,950
You were perfect.
You played it to a T.

830
01:39:44,017 --> 01:39:46,439
But that was it.

831
01:39:46,514 --> 01:39:47,888
End of part.

832
01:39:49,073 --> 01:39:50,928
Wrap Jake Scully.

833
01:39:54,481 --> 01:39:56,685
You had to play the hero...

834
01:39:56,753 --> 01:40:00,365
improvise all this crap
about finding a body double...

835
01:40:00,433 --> 01:40:02,921
and unmasking the Indian.

836
01:40:05,874 --> 01:40:08,427
But you didn't think it through.

837
01:40:08,498 --> 01:40:12,971
Sometimes heroes
come to tragic ends.

838
01:40:14,354 --> 01:40:17,801
What's the matter?
A little short of breath?

839
01:40:20,722 --> 01:40:22,347
What a terrible way to die.

840
01:40:23,729 --> 01:40:25,671
Especially when you're
so claustrophobic.

841
01:40:26,738 --> 01:40:28,112
Wait a minute.

842
01:40:28,177 --> 01:40:30,894
I'll give you another take.

843
01:40:33,137 --> 01:40:36,520
The only problem is
you've got to act.

844
01:40:42,577 --> 01:40:43,952
Come on.

845
01:40:44,593 --> 01:40:46,481
Action.

846
01:40:51,538 --> 01:40:52,912
And action.

847
01:41:00,786 --> 01:41:02,760
Cut. Get him out of here.
Move the camera out.

848
01:41:02,833 --> 01:41:05,070
Joe, give me a hand.
Jake, take it easy.

849
01:41:05,138 --> 01:41:07,047
What's going on?

850
01:41:07,121 --> 01:41:08,976
We're getting you out.
That's all right.

851
01:41:09,041 --> 01:41:10,896
We got you. Let go.
Don't worry about it.

852
01:41:10,961 --> 01:41:13,449
- Don't worry about nothing.
- It's all right. We're here.

853
01:41:13,522 --> 01:41:16,653
Give him some air.
Talk to me.

854
01:41:16,721 --> 01:41:19,820
Say something.
Walk it off. Just go for a walk.

855
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:22,159
Just relax. Just breathe in.

856
01:41:22,226 --> 01:41:24,811
All right, that's good.
There you go.

857
01:41:24,881 --> 01:41:26,736
What's the matter, babe?

858
01:41:26,801 --> 01:41:30,282
Boy, you had us scared there.
What's the problem?

859
01:41:30,354 --> 01:41:32,209
Wait a minute.

860
01:41:36,562 --> 01:41:39,529
- Get away from me.
- Babe, just relax.

861
01:41:39,602 --> 01:41:41,609
- We're just trying to help you.
- I know.

862
01:41:41,681 --> 01:41:44,398
I can help myself.

863
01:41:44,465 --> 01:41:48,589
Listen, Scully,
why don't you cool off?

864
01:41:48,657 --> 01:41:52,137
Go on home,
and we'll shoot this another time.

865
01:41:52,209 --> 01:41:53,584
All right?

866
01:41:55,537 --> 01:41:57,610
Don't lie to me.

867
01:41:57,682 --> 01:41:59,853
If I don't get this shot,
you'll fire me.

868
01:42:01,553 --> 01:42:04,488
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would I do a thing like that?

869
01:42:11,474 --> 01:42:16,013
Save the speech, Rubin. I know all about
your personal commitment to the actors.

870
01:42:16,082 --> 01:42:19,529
I'm a little claustrophobic.
Youll work around it, right?

871
01:42:19,601 --> 01:42:21,456
Yeah, that's right.

872
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
- I don't like your attitude.
- Yeah?
If I get this shot,
you'll like it a lot better, right?

873
01:42:42,962 --> 01:42:44,336
Let's do it!

874
01:42:52,785 --> 01:42:55,174
You better get it right this time.

875
01:42:55,249 --> 01:42:57,802
You're one pain in the ass
I don't need.

876
01:42:59,921 --> 01:43:02,572
- Okay, Joe.
- Roll sound. Quiet.

877
01:43:02,641 --> 01:43:04,812
And action I

878
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:13,777
You bastard!

879
01:43:13,841 --> 01:43:15,401
Don't be so melodramatic.

880
01:43:20,593 --> 01:43:22,088
Kill!

881
01:43:32,561 --> 01:43:34,634
What are you doing?

882
01:43:34,706 --> 01:43:37,226
- What am I doing? I'm saving you.
- From who?

883
01:43:37,297 --> 01:43:42,447
- From... The Indian was Sam Bouchard.
- Wait a minute.

884
01:43:42,513 --> 01:43:45,547
Am I missing something?
Is there somebody here that I don't see?

885
01:43:45,618 --> 01:43:47,690
Yes! The dog knocked him in.

886
01:43:47,761 --> 01:43:49,616
Come look. Come here.

887
01:43:50,770 --> 01:43:53,006
Look, he must have knocked him in.
He went...

888
01:43:53,073 --> 01:43:57,678
I thought it belonged to Gloria, but
it must have belonged to the husband.

889
01:43:57,746 --> 01:44:01,226
That's why he never barked at the Indian
when he tried to sneak in the house.

890
01:44:01,297 --> 01:44:03,883
I think you're absolutely right.
We should go to the police.

891
01:44:03,954 --> 01:44:06,255
- Really? You believe me?
- Yes. I believe you.

892
01:44:06,321 --> 01:44:09,704
I believe you are a number one sicko
and should be put away for life!

893
01:44:09,777 --> 01:44:11,981
I know all about you guys.

894
01:44:12,049 --> 01:44:14,896
I've seen about you
on late-night television.

895
01:44:14,961 --> 01:44:17,383
You're one of those necrophiliacs,
a corpse fucker!

896
01:44:17,457 --> 01:44:19,878
- I am not.
- Yes! I turn you on, all right.

897
01:44:19,953 --> 01:44:21,863
The only problem is that
I'm still moving!

898
01:44:21,938 --> 01:44:24,393
Unconscious is good,
but dead is better, right?

899
01:44:26,513 --> 01:44:27,887
Are you all right?

900
01:44:28,914 --> 01:44:30,288
Here, take my hand.

901
01:44:31,217 --> 01:44:33,006
Do not touch me.

902
01:44:33,073 --> 01:44:35,375
I'm not dead yet.

903
01:44:38,257 --> 01:44:43,080
I know this all seems crazy,
but I'm trying to help you.

904
01:44:43,153 --> 01:44:45,968
Are you gonna stay in there
for the rest of your life?

905
01:45:28,594 --> 01:45:30,448
Freeze.
Don't move your hand, Jake.

906
01:45:30,514 --> 01:45:32,040
- How does that look?
- It looks great.

907
01:45:32,113 --> 01:45:35,561
Good. Terrific. Hold that move.
Let's 86 the bat.

908
01:45:35,633 --> 01:45:38,764
That's a wrap on the bat.
Get the bat out.

909
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:41,965
- I gotta hold the hand really still.
- Help him out.

910
01:45:42,034 --> 01:45:45,329
- Turn the water off.
- Can I slip out?

911
01:45:45,393 --> 01:45:48,524
Wait till we get the bar in there.
Wait till we get the stand in here.

912
01:45:48,593 --> 01:45:52,522
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Between the bottom two fingers.

913
01:45:56,753 --> 01:45:59,404
Good. Okay, sweetheart,
you can slide out.

914
01:45:59,473 --> 01:46:01,644
Don't move the hand.
Freeze the hand.

915
01:46:01,713 --> 01:46:03,568
Makeup.
Let's get a touch-up for Jake.

916
01:46:03,633 --> 01:46:05,967
Don't move the hand.
Keep the hand very still.

917
01:46:06,034 --> 01:46:07,560
Excuse me.

918
01:46:07,633 --> 01:46:09,488
Don't move the bar!

919
01:46:11,313 --> 01:46:13,004
- I'm sorry.
- Did the bar move?

920
01:46:13,073 --> 01:46:14,447
That's okay.

921
01:46:15,889 --> 01:46:18,606
- You're doing a great job.
- Did I flash the teeth long enough?

922
01:46:18,673 --> 01:46:21,968
Best teeth flashing I've ever seen.
It looked beautiful, babe.

923
01:46:22,033 --> 01:46:23,888
I'm so glad
I fired that other asshole.

924
01:46:23,953 --> 01:46:26,921
This part was made for you.
I mean it. You look sensational.

925
01:46:26,993 --> 01:46:29,961
- This bar is falling.
- That looks good.

926
01:46:30,034 --> 01:46:31,560
- You holding up?
- Yeah.

927
01:46:31,633 --> 01:46:34,121
Just a little longer.
Okay, girls, step out. Step back.

928
01:46:34,193 --> 01:46:36,048
Let's bring in the body double.

929
01:46:36,113 --> 01:46:38,601
- Thanks.
- The hair looks good.

930
01:46:38,674 --> 01:46:40,845
Is that as hot
as that water gets?

931
01:46:40,913 --> 01:46:42,768
Slide in there, sweetheart.

932
01:46:42,833 --> 01:46:45,484
- Don't move the bar. It's important.
- I know.

933
01:46:45,553 --> 01:46:48,204
Hi. I'm Mindy.
Pleased to meet you.

934
01:46:48,274 --> 01:46:51,241
- Nice to meet you.
- Listen, be very, very careful.

935
01:46:51,313 --> 01:46:53,320
My breasts are very tender.

936
01:46:53,393 --> 01:46:55,084
I've got my period.

937
01:46:56,273 --> 01:46:57,647
We good here?

938
01:46:59,633 --> 01:47:02,765
I'm gonna...
Just bring your body up like this.

939
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:04,688
My hand is right here.
I can't move my hand.

940
01:47:04,753 --> 01:47:07,241
Keep your hand exactly still.
Let's shoot it.

941
01:47:07,313 --> 01:47:09,485
Let's slide the bar out.

942
01:47:09,553 --> 01:47:11,724
Drop the camera.
Let's get the camera down.

943
01:47:13,073 --> 01:47:15,561
Wait till we're in position.

944
01:47:15,633 --> 01:47:17,324
Can you bring your body
up to my hand?

945
01:47:21,713 --> 01:47:24,430
Quiet, please!
I'm trying to think.

946
01:47:38,033 --> 01:47:40,848
You're gonna get a lot of dates
when this comes out.

947
01:47:40,913 --> 01:47:42,440
Here we go. Action.

948
01:47:42,513 --> 01:47:44,040
Action with the hand.

949
01:47:46,834 --> 01:47:49,005
Great action.

950
01:47:49,073 --> 01:47:50,928
Is that too hard?
