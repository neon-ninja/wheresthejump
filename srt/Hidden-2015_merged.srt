1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:19,622
<i>Mom? Are you awake? Mom?</i>

3
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,063
<i>ZoZo? What are you doing up? It's still early.</i>

4
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:30,007
<i>- Go back to sleep.
- I can't. Olive is scared.</i>

5
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:37,449
<i>Mom.</i>

6
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:54,591
<i>Down here.</i>

7
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,041
ZoZo, what are you doing under here?

8
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:07,272
Mom, I told you, I don't like
that stupid baby name anymore.

9
00:02:07,436 --> 00:02:09,507
My name's Zoe.

10
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,977
And I'm under here because I'm hiding.

11
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:17,488
Olive said we had to hide.
She dreamed they found us.

12
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:18,797
Who did?

13
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:24,630
- The Breathers.
- Hey, what did we just talk about?

14
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:25,937
Our new rule, remember?

15
00:02:26,088 --> 00:02:29,501
Rule number four. We're not allowed
to talk about them anymore.

16
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:31,605
I didn't. Olive did.

17
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:33,866
Well, you can tell Olive that no one found us.

18
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,273
Dad's been keeping watch all night,
just like always. We're safe here.

19
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:38,583
You hear that, Olive?

20
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:46,142
<i>- My smile is stuck.</i>
- Her smile is stuck.

21
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:48,983
That means she doesn't want
to be smiling anymore.

22
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:50,556
That means she's still scared.

23
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:54,490
Would it make Olive feel better
if we went and checked with Dad?

24
00:02:59,155 --> 00:03:01,101
It's okay.

25
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,236
All right.

26
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,552
Come on.

27
00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:24,252
It's okay.

28
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,399
Mom, look.

29
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:30,761
- That's just Dad.
- It doesn't look like Dad.

30
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:37,233
- Oh. Someone had another nightmare?
- Dad.

31
00:03:37,393 --> 00:03:38,770
Hey, hey.

32
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:43,207
- Thought we told those nightmares to go away.
- We did.

33
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,513
- Well, then why are you so scared?
- Better ask Olive about that.

34
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,980
Oh, was it Olive this time, huh?

35
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:52,813
How does she even sleep
with her eyes open all the time?

36
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:55,319
- Dad, don't be mean.
- I was just wondering.

37
00:03:55,478 --> 00:03:58,925
- She wants a report.
- Well, then I better consult my notes.

38
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,464
My glasses, please.

39
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,810
Thank you.

40
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:22,439
So my watch started at 10.

41
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:28,646
At 2, I played seven games of solitaire.
Won four, lost three.

42
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:33,624
Lost four, won three.
Ms. Zoe, you see right through me.

43
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:36,423
At 5, a couple of deer ran overhead.

44
00:04:36,585 --> 00:04:41,659
And at 6 in the morning,
I heard little footsteps.

45
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:46,830
Possibly belonging
to my rascal of a daughter. Hmm?

46
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:53,606
But other than that, nothing,
not a creature was stirring, not even...

47
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:56,375
- A Breather?
- ZoZo.

48
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,387
No, not even a...

49
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:06,220
- you know.
- And the locks?

50
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:13,230
- They still hold fast?
- Do you wanna check?

51
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:14,561
- Can I?
- No.

52
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:17,114
Ray, I told you I don't want
her going up there anymore.

53
00:05:17,214 --> 00:05:20,470
What? This little monkey?
She can handle it.

54
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:23,104
Yeah, I can handle it, Mom.
I know the rules.

55
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:24,456
One: Never be loud.

56
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,647
- I know you know the rules.
- Two: Never lose control.

57
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:30,172
Three: Never open the door.
Four: Never talk about the Breathers.

58
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:41,659
- Careful, ZoZo, your shoe.
- I got it, Mom.

59
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:29,306
Hold fast?

60
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,608
Hold fast.

61
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:48,723
Can't I just go barefoot?

62
00:06:48,884 --> 00:06:51,057
No, that wouldn't be right.

63
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:53,204
Why not?

64
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:56,996
Because we're not animals, Zoe.

65
00:06:58,027 --> 00:07:00,268
I need you to remember that.

66
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,337
But it's not like I'm going outside
or anything.

67
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:06,878
Well, who needs to go outside
when we brought the sun with us?

68
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:15,744
Another beautiful day, huh?

69
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:17,949
Hm.

70
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,457
You wanna make it official?

71
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:31,297
Not too hard, okay?
I don't want you to slip.

72
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,610
I got it, Mom.

73
00:07:34,063 --> 00:07:35,213
<i>Okay.</i>

74
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:39,279
- How many days is that?
- If you don't remember, just count them.

75
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:42,211
They're lined up in rows of 25.
And there are how many rows?

76
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:46,046
One, two, three, eight, nine. Twelve.

77
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,710
So 25 times 12 makes?

78
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:51,553
Three hundred plus the one I just marked.
So 301.

79
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:55,321
That's it. See?
Those math lessons are really paying off.

80
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:02,626
<i>- Give me a kiss.</i>
- That means she's hungry.

81
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:09,468
Let's see here. We've got hominy...

82
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:13,679
corn, potatoes, beans.

83
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:17,748
- And peaches.
- Peaches. Definitely peaches.

84
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:19,749
You know, we had peaches yesterday.

85
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:21,649
We can have them again tomorrow.

86
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,417
But I was thinking today, maybe we should
try something with a little protein.

87
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:28,994
- Maybe beans for once.
- Ew, beans are the worst.

88
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:31,358
- Dad. Beans or peaches?
- Yeah?

89
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,399
Uh, I don't know.

90
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,196
- Peaches.
- Peaches sound pretty good to me.

91
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:38,509
Ray.

92
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:44,076
- Uh, how about we take a vote?
- Ray.

93
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,907
All those in favor of beans,
please raise your hand.

94
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:53,449
One vote for beans. Now, all those in favor
of deliciously sweet peaches, raise your hand.

95
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:58,588
Sorry, hon. Two against one.

96
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:00,898
Three.

97
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:31,414
- Is Darlene acting up again?
- No, she's a tough gal.

98
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,424
She just needs a little encouragement,
that's all.

99
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,805
There we go. Told you she was tough.

100
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:55,310
Mom. Dad. The peaches are gone.

101
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:58,179
- Not funny, ZoZo.
- I'm serious. Someone stole them.

102
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:31,374
God. That's 12. That's 12 cans.

103
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,020
That's almost two weeks of rations.

104
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,122
There are no more peaches?

105
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:39,152
Uh, no. No more peaches.

106
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:42,261
Something must've been drawn to the sugar.
Something with teeth.

107
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,693
What has teeth like that?

108
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,003
A rat, probably.

109
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:50,336
But a rat couldn't get in here.
I checked the door. It's hold fast.

110
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:52,836
The door is not the only way in.

111
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:03,079
Can the Breathers get in there too?

112
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:05,479
- ZoZo.
- Can they?

113
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:08,520
No, they're too big to fit in there.

114
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:11,089
But a rat could.

115
00:11:13,148 --> 00:11:15,788
If it's a rat, it's still in here somewhere.

116
00:11:17,686 --> 00:11:20,064
We have to keep an eye out.

117
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:23,203
We have to find it
before it steals any more food.

118
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:27,199
In the meantime,
we'll have to cut down on our rations.

119
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:29,672
Dad, they're already so small.

120
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:35,940
I'm sorry, Zoe.

121
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:39,311
I really am.

122
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:56,192
I'm not gonna ask you again. Eat.

123
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:59,862
- Mom, I told you, I don't want stupid beans.
- Hey, remember rule number two.

124
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:01,632
Never lose control.

125
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:05,040
- Never let anger take over.
- Rule number five: Never call me ZoZo.

126
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,043
- I just wanted some peaches.
- A thief stole them.

127
00:12:08,203 --> 00:12:10,615
And now we're all gonna have
to give some things up.

128
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,251
I already have nothing.

129
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:14,978
I'm stuck in here. I can't even go outside.

130
00:12:15,143 --> 00:12:20,115
I don't have any friends except Olive
and she can only say five things.

131
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,125
- What about us?
- What?

132
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,491
Well, you said you don't have any friends.

133
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:28,000
What about us?
Mom and I aren't your friends?

134
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:30,295
- You know what I mean.
- No, actually, I don't.

135
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:34,407
I think it's silly to say you don't have
anything when you really have everything.

136
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:37,635
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right. Look at that.

137
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:42,474
- How many days did you say that was?
- Three hundred and one.

138
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:45,642
Three hundred and one.

139
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,447
We shouldn't have been around
for any one of those days.

140
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,851
But just when we needed it...

141
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:53,320
we found this shelter...

142
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:57,089
and it's given us food, a home, a life.

143
00:12:57,252 --> 00:13:02,861
And for all we know, we could be
the only ones left, the only ones still alive.

144
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:08,272
So every one of those marks
is really a miracle.

145
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,874
- A miracle?
- That's right. A miracle.

146
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:14,913
And this food is gonna allow you
to live another day.

147
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,346
And that means another hatch
can be drawn, right?

148
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:19,513
Yeah, I guess so.

149
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:24,988
So you see those nasty cold mushy beans
on your plate?

150
00:13:25,547 --> 00:13:27,891
They're really their own kind of miracle too.

151
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:32,031
And if you eat your mushy miracles for us...

152
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:36,663
then maybe we can take a trip afterwards.

153
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:39,328
- A trip? Really?
- Really.

154
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:43,169
But you better eat fast, because I finished
my miracle beans and I want more.

155
00:13:49,104 --> 00:13:50,549
Careful with it, Dad.

156
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,376
- Hm.
- Hm.

157
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,915
- That goes there. Joey's house goes there.
- All right. Off we go.

158
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,656
Eight.

159
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:05,588
Five, six, seven. Sylvia's Ice Cream.

160
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:11,436
Okay. Let me get the door.

161
00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:14,612
Door's open.

162
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:18,644
The chimes ring above you.

163
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,882
And, look, there's Sylvia
standing behind the counter.

164
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:26,576
And she's wearing
that silly cone-shaped apron.

165
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:30,656
Good morning, little Zoe.

166
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:36,122
And she hands you
one of those little pink plastic spoons.

167
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:42,194
And you run your other hand
along that cold glass countertop.

168
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:51,409
Inside, you see barrels and barrels
of Sylvia's fresh homemade ice cream.

169
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:54,410
But now it's still early,
so she's got all the best flavors.

170
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:58,210
Salted Honey. Peanut Butter Brittle Crunch.

171
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:01,217
And of course, your favorite.

172
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:05,390
- Strawberry Shortcake.
- Ha, ha.

173
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:08,552
Are you there?

174
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,832
You happy now?

175
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,680
Till tomorrow.

176
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:25,438
Till tomorrow.

177
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:42,425
You win.

178
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:47,425
I win.

179
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,500
- Aha. I win.
- Everything's gonna work out.

180
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,303
I'm trying to believe that, Ray. I really am.

181
00:15:57,466 --> 00:16:00,140
But imaginary ice cream
isn't gonna feed our daughter.

182
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:02,441
- Told you.
- Just trying to keep her spirits up.

183
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:06,051
And you are.
But what happens when she gets sick?

184
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:12,258
We've lost a lot of weight already,
all of us, and now...

185
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:15,554
And now we're just gonna have to find
a way to get more food.

186
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:19,926
Real food.
I'll go to the damn surface if I have to.

187
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:21,238
You can't, Ray.

188
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:24,133
- They're still looking for us.
- Yeah, well, I can fight them.

189
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:25,828
That's suicide, and you know it.

190
00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:32,706
Do you remember our promise
when we first got here?

191
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:37,044
Zoe comes first. No matter the cost.

192
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,321
- The important thing is we haven't been found.
- Except by a rat.

193
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:44,252
But only by a rat.

194
00:16:50,485 --> 00:16:52,761
Oh, honey.

195
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,606
Try changing your point of view.

196
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:08,512
This shelter can be a prison
or it can be a home.

197
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,913
- Beans can be beans or they can be...
- Miracle beans.

198
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:17,182
- Why not?
- Because I'm not 9 years old, Ray.

199
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:19,552
I get what you're trying to do for ZoZo.

200
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:24,053
But I don't believe in miracles.

201
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:28,931
- Not anymore.
- Well, you should.

202
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:34,836
This is our life now,
and we have to live it the best we can.

203
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:39,103
Or else what's the point?

204
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:42,476
- The point is to stay alive.
- And we can do that...

205
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,351
and still live.

206
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:03,900
- Ray?
- Huh?

207
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,970
What are you doing?

208
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,004
Living.

209
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,681
- Well, we gotta be real quiet.
- Relax.

210
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,002
I'll see you tonight.

211
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:50,473
Have fun.

212
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:05,630
Mom! Mom! Please!

213
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:07,494
Zoe!

214
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:10,968
Mom! Dad! They're coming!

215
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,483
Oh. That's a doozy. A five and a two.

216
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:28,314
- So five divided by two is...
- Two and a half.

217
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:30,820
Bingo. You can move your car now.

218
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,691
Come on. Thought this would be
a fun change of pace.

219
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:36,192
It's still boring math, Mom.
Even with Kingsville.

220
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:39,161
Well, if it's so boring,
how come Olive's still smiling?

221
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:45,333
That's her fake smile.
That's why she looks a little... You know.

222
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:46,995
- Creepy?
- Ah!

223
00:19:47,162 --> 00:19:48,732
I didn't mean that, honey.

224
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,810
She just needs a bath. That's all.

225
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:54,173
How about we have
another go around the board...

226
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:56,646
and then we take a break, okay?

227
00:19:56,805 --> 00:19:57,955
Okay.

228
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:09,725
Mom? Do you think Dad's right?

229
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:12,125
- Right about what?
- You know...

230
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:15,757
about the three of us
being the only ones left?

231
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:25,169
- The periscope?
- That's right.

232
00:20:26,234 --> 00:20:28,771
- What do you want me to do with it?
- What do you think?

233
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:32,218
I want you to look up there.

234
00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:34,372
On the surface?

235
00:20:35,877 --> 00:20:39,950
I thought you said I wasn't allowed to do
that, ever, ever, ever, or I'd be dead meat.

236
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:44,655
Yeah, well, I'm trying something new today.

237
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:45,969
What?

238
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,733
Relaxing.

239
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

240
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:45,020
So, what do you see?

241
00:21:46,214 --> 00:21:49,855
Nothing. The school. Playground.

242
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:51,893
Nothing.

243
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:55,660
Dad's right. It's just us left.

244
00:21:55,824 --> 00:21:58,134
- Us and Olive.
- But do you see us and Olive?

245
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:00,239
- No, Mom.
- Do you see the shelter door?

246
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,242
- I can't see the door. It's covered.
- Exactly.

247
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:15,116
When we first came down here, Dad and I
made sure to hide the door, remember?

248
00:22:15,276 --> 00:22:17,722
So that no one could ever find us.

249
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:21,116
- So?
- So...

250
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:26,456
sometimes, just because you can't see
something doesn't mean it's not there.

251
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:32,161
Sometimes the truth's hidden from us.

252
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:48,148
Do you think our friends
could really be out there?

253
00:22:48,943 --> 00:22:51,219
They're just hidden like us?

254
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:53,689
They could. They'd have to be.

255
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:55,850
Because the Breathers
would be hunting them?

256
00:22:56,017 --> 00:22:57,792
ZoZo.

257
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,695
Yeah, the Breathers
would be hunting them too.

258
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:08,568
They hate us a lot, don't they?
To keep hunting us like that?

259
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,109
I don't know that it's hate. It's just...

260
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,580
They're different than we are.

261
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:17,216
And that makes them as scared of us
as we are of them.

262
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:20,546
- Because of what happened that day?
- Yeah. Because of what happened.

263
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,047
- You said Breathers.
- I know.

264
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,268
The thief.

265
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,797
He's back.

266
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:38,661
Don't look.

267
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:40,763
Hey.

268
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,236
What's wrong?

269
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:45,635
It's the thief.

270
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:59,121
That son of a bitch.

271
00:24:01,516 --> 00:24:04,195
I'll kill it. Just stay back
in case it makes a run for it.

272
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:05,853
No, no, you stay back.
I'll kill it.

273
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:09,230
- No, I'll kill it.
- We can't all kill it, guys.

274
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,462
You remember that Thanksgiving
at Aunt Cathy's a couple years ago?

275
00:24:12,627 --> 00:24:16,165
With that insane possum
in the backyard?

276
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:20,034
Who took care of that thing?

277
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:40,192
- After Dad kills it, can we eat it for dinner?
- ZoZo, quiet.

278
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:52,671
- Get it, Dad.
- Unh. Shit.

279
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:56,045
Dad!

280
00:24:57,972 --> 00:24:59,576
- It's getting away! Hurry!
- I know.

281
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:05,413
Dad!

282
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,929
Mom!

283
00:25:15,657 --> 00:25:17,136
Wow.

284
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:22,037
That was awesome.

285
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:25,304
Even more awesome
than when Dad killed the possum?

286
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:27,036
Definitely.

287
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,420
What is that?

288
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,085
Get back, get back.

289
00:25:41,516 --> 00:25:43,587
Turn it. Turn it off, Dad.

290
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:47,028
It's gonna break. Get back. Get back!

291
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:57,934
- It's burning Kingsville.
- We'll put it out. Just stay here.

292
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:01,971
Stay here.

293
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:07,324
Not again.

294
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:14,922
Come on, Ray!

295
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:23,395
Ray! Help me!

296
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:28,465
- Don't break her!
- Darlene can take it!

297
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:32,901
Ray, come on!

298
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:41,252
I told you she was tough!
All right, move back, move back!

299
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:50,091
ZoZo! I told you to stay back!

300
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:19,291
I can't see a damn thing.

301
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:23,756
Hold on.

302
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:31,942
Where's ZoZo?

303
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,733
- Zoe?
- ZoZo?

304
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:41,875
ZoZo? ZoZo.

305
00:27:44,172 --> 00:27:45,845
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

306
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:48,385
- Did the fire burn you?
- I'm just scared.

307
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:52,252
Well, there's nothing
to be scared of anymore. We put the fire out.

308
00:27:52,413 --> 00:27:57,158
Nobody's hurt. Look, even Olive's okay.

309
00:27:57,318 --> 00:28:01,391
Just a little dirty, that's all. See?

310
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:05,197
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- No, Dad. It's not.

311
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,737
It's not gonna be okay.

312
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:10,668
They're gonna see.

313
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,049
Who?

314
00:28:14,302 --> 00:28:16,282
The Breathers.

315
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,864
My God.

316
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:53,484
Hello, bacon.

317
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:57,712
- Where'd your little sous chef run off to?
- Upstairs getting ready.

318
00:28:57,879 --> 00:29:01,156
Still? How long does it take
to put on a swimsuit?

319
00:29:01,315 --> 00:29:04,228
A long time when you're trying
to impress Joey.

320
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:07,093
- Joey?
- Yeah, he's coming along with us.

321
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:08,666
Joey Neary, next door?

322
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:13,738
- He's a real cutie, don't you think?
- I think he can barely tie his own shoes.

323
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:16,239
That's what I think. Joey Neary.

324
00:29:16,397 --> 00:29:18,434
Come on, you remember young love,
don't you?

325
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:23,173
Yeah, well, I had definitely outgrown
Nerf weapons by our first date.

326
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:27,184
- I don't like this at all.
- Dad. Why didn't you tell me?

327
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:30,150
- Tell you what?
- That Joey's going on vacation.

328
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:34,259
- We were supposed to play Marco Polo.
- That can't be true. I talked to Jillian.

329
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:36,361
Just leave it. We don't need it.

330
00:29:36,517 --> 00:29:39,293
- We have to go. Come on.
- Leave everything there.

331
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:41,364
We got what we need.

332
00:29:45,226 --> 00:29:46,376
Come on.

333
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,774
- Hey, Ted.
- That's good.

334
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:52,172
- Jillian?
- What else?

335
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,176
- Ted, is everything okay?
- Jillian.

336
00:29:55,469 --> 00:29:58,006
- Hey, Joey. What's going on?
- I don't wanna leave.

337
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:00,311
- Why do you have to leave?
- The government man.

338
00:30:00,474 --> 00:30:03,353
He said the virus, it changes people bad.

339
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:05,684
- What kind of virus?
- Come on. We have to go.

340
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,826
- Where are you going?
- Sorry, no time.

341
00:30:07,982 --> 00:30:11,122
- What's happening?
- Just get Zoe and get as far away as you can.

342
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:15,392
- Come on, let's go!
- Tell Zoe I'm sorry I can't play Marco Polo.

343
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:19,032
Ted.

344
00:30:24,565 --> 00:30:26,806
Where's everyone going?

345
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:28,879
I got that. I'll get it. Don't worry.

346
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,209
Just pack that up. I'll be right back.

347
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:53,766
The Breathers.
They're gonna see it, aren't they?

348
00:30:54,762 --> 00:30:56,503
Aren't they?

349
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:01,405
Well, it's sundown.
So maybe it's too dark to see the smoke.

350
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:04,716
Maybe.

351
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,743
Can you see any smoke?

352
00:31:42,143 --> 00:31:44,783
Don't forget rule two, Claire.
We have to stay calm.

353
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:47,152
- Have to stay under control.
- I have to think.

354
00:31:47,314 --> 00:31:49,988
Anyone within a mile of here
will have seen that smoke.

355
00:31:50,151 --> 00:31:52,290
The Breathers are gonna come for us.
I know it.

356
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:54,831
- Let Mom and I talk, okay?
- They're gonna find us.

357
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:56,900
- Just like Olive dreamed.
- They're not.

358
00:31:57,058 --> 00:31:58,230
- They might.
- Stop.

359
00:31:58,392 --> 00:32:00,394
Stop? I'm trying to figure out what to do.

360
00:32:00,561 --> 00:32:03,235
We're not gonna do anything.
Even if they see the smoke...

361
00:32:03,397 --> 00:32:07,072
and I don't think they will,
by time they get here, it'll be gone.

362
00:32:07,234 --> 00:32:10,306
- They'll have no idea where it came from.
- They'll know we're here.

363
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:13,315
- They'll search the area for us.
- So let them come.

364
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:18,148
They've searched here a dozen times before.
They've never found us.

365
00:32:19,914 --> 00:32:24,863
- And they're not gonna find us now.
- Dad's right. We're still hidden.

366
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:26,226
I checked. Remember?

367
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:29,390
All agreed we're safe,
please raise your hand.

368
00:32:30,691 --> 00:32:33,638
- Two against one.
- Three.

369
00:32:51,545 --> 00:32:53,286
What's wrong, Mom?

370
00:32:57,651 --> 00:33:00,894
- The Wood's burned.
- So?

371
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:06,164
So burned wood makes ash.

372
00:33:16,604 --> 00:33:20,347
We're not hidden anymore, are we?

373
00:33:20,508 --> 00:33:23,546
- I don't think they'll notice.
- You really wanna take that risk?

374
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:27,553
- I don't have another choice.
- We cover the ash.

375
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:28,865
How?

376
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:31,157
We'd have to go onto the surface.

377
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:36,832
But what about the third rule?
Never, ever, open the door.

378
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:43,234
Sometimes rules, even Mom Rules,
have to be broken.

379
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:50,311
Listen to me. If you hear anything
up there, anything but me and Dad...

380
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:53,315
- I want you to lock the door behind us.
- What?

381
00:33:53,474 --> 00:33:55,681
No, I'm going up there with you,
I'm gonna help.

382
00:33:55,843 --> 00:33:58,187
- Out of the question, ZoZo.
- It's Zoe.

383
00:33:58,345 --> 00:34:01,519
- Stop treating me like a baby.
- I'm protecting you.

384
00:34:01,682 --> 00:34:05,494
But what if you need me to protect you?
I can fight if I have to.

385
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:07,758
No, you can't. My rules still apply to you.

386
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:13,770
So no matter what happens up there,
no matter what you hear, do not open the door.

387
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:17,068
- But...
- I need you to promise me that.

388
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:19,602
Promise.

389
00:34:21,502 --> 00:34:23,243
Promise.

390
00:34:34,415 --> 00:34:38,022
We have to move fast. I don't wanna be
up there for more than three minutes.

391
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:40,461
Three minutes.

392
00:34:41,555 --> 00:34:43,262
Okay.

393
00:35:14,788 --> 00:35:18,201
They're going this way, Olive. Come on.

394
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:52,567
No. I don't know where they went.

395
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

396
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:50,524
It's just them, Olive. They're okay.

397
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:04,740
Mom! Dad! Look out behind you!

398
00:37:04,898 --> 00:37:08,038
Mom! Dad! Hurry!

399
00:37:42,836 --> 00:37:44,315
Dad!

400
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:49,012
Mom! Dad!

401
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:55,960
Dad!

402
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Mom!
Dad!

403
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,217
What the hell are you doing?
I told you to stay inside.

404
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:08,663
- I saw...
- Slow down. We can't understand you.

405
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,331
Breathers.

406
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:11,999
Watch out!

407
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,712
It's just deer, Zoe.

408
00:38:20,274 --> 00:38:22,447
Nothing to be scared of.

409
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:24,350
Just Bambi.

410
00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:28,988
- They looked scared.
- No, don't be silly.

411
00:38:29,149 --> 00:38:31,652
She's right, Ray. They're running away.

412
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,232
Running away from something.

413
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,935
We have to get back in the shelter.

414
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,050
Careful.

415
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:49,097
- What happened? Did you see something?
- Quiet, quiet.

416
00:39:57,638 --> 00:39:59,447
What is it, Dad?

417
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,853
Footsteps.

418
00:40:21,762 --> 00:40:23,503
- I think it's just one.
- Why just one?

419
00:40:23,664 --> 00:40:25,541
They've always traveled
in groups before.

420
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:27,576
I don't know.

421
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:30,706
Maybe he's the only one
who saw the smoke.

422
00:40:34,174 --> 00:40:36,415
He's headed this way.

423
00:40:39,746 --> 00:40:41,623
ZoZo, we have to stay quiet.

424
00:40:41,782 --> 00:40:43,659
Rule number one, remember?
Never be loud.

425
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:47,629
- I know. I'm trying.
- Try harder.

426
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:51,160
If he hears us, he will find us, understand?

427
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:54,033
- Do you understand me?
- Zoe, Zoe, Zoe.

428
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:56,196
Zoe, come here.

429
00:40:57,064 --> 00:40:58,771
Have a seat.

430
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:05,579
What do you say we get out of here?
Because look what I found.

431
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:06,889
With this car...

432
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:11,282
you can go anywhere you want.

433
00:41:11,445 --> 00:41:13,288
Anywhere in the world.

434
00:41:13,447 --> 00:41:14,824
Any time.

435
00:41:17,884 --> 00:41:20,160
- Where do you wanna go?
- My bed.

436
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,594
- Yeah.
- My old bed.

437
00:41:21,755 --> 00:41:23,234
Yeah.

438
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:28,362
That's an excellent choice. Okay. Okay.

439
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:36,305
You collapse on your bed.

440
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,746
Exhausted after a long day.

441
00:41:40,641 --> 00:41:46,114
And you pull those warm pink polka-dot sheets
all the way up to your eyes.

442
00:41:50,684 --> 00:41:53,756
And you hug all your stuffed animals.

443
00:41:55,055 --> 00:42:00,004
Puffy Bear, Duck Duck, Cathypillar.

444
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,832
Kissing them good night.

445
00:42:11,705 --> 00:42:17,018
And you can feel the fan on your nightstand
blowing a soft breeze through your hair.

446
00:42:23,817 --> 00:42:26,764
And then you look up
at the ceiling above you...

447
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,329
where we hung
those glow-in-the-dark stars...

448
00:42:32,526 --> 00:42:34,904
and they shine for you.

449
00:42:35,729 --> 00:42:38,437
So there's always light.

450
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,874
Even when you sleep.

451
00:42:44,171 --> 00:42:46,151
Even when you dream.

452
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,250
Are you there?

453
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:59,924
Yeah, I'm there.

454
00:43:03,323 --> 00:43:05,303
Can you see the stars?

455
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

456
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:49,676
Let it go, let it go.

457
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:17,458
<i>My smile is stuck.</i>

458
00:45:17,622 --> 00:45:21,331
<i>Stuck. Stuck. Stuck.</i>

459
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,565
It's okay, baby.

460
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:56,802
It's okay, baby. You're gonna be okay.

461
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:08,516
He can get here, can't he?

462
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:12,953
Hold fast, right, Dad?

463
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:23,355
He's too strong!

464
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:28,767
We need something to brace the door.

465
00:46:30,294 --> 00:46:33,935
- Something tough.
- Go! Go!

466
00:46:46,043 --> 00:46:48,182
- You can't go up there!
- Tell Dad to hurry!

467
00:46:48,346 --> 00:46:50,724
- Dad, hurry!
- I am hurrying!

468
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,133
- Mom? Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Just stay down there.

469
00:47:07,298 --> 00:47:09,175
Dad, hurry!

470
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:18,714
Ray!

471
00:47:26,617 --> 00:47:30,121
- He's almost through!
- Hold on!

472
00:47:30,721 --> 00:47:32,564
- Dad!
- Watch out!

473
00:47:34,392 --> 00:47:36,702
- Give me the pipe!
- Wedge it under the handle!

474
00:47:36,861 --> 00:47:38,363
Watch out, Mom!

475
00:47:56,814 --> 00:48:00,887
Watch out, Claire! Die! Die!

476
00:48:04,755 --> 00:48:06,701
Ray!

477
00:48:06,857 --> 00:48:11,135
Ray! Ray! Ray!

478
00:48:17,802 --> 00:48:22,979
Ray! Ray, he's not getting in!
He's not getting in. It'll hold.

479
00:48:25,977 --> 00:48:30,653
It will. Okay? Okay.

480
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:32,692
<i>Hey.</i>

481
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:36,255
<i>Hey.</i>

482
00:48:47,465 --> 00:48:49,376
Hold fast?

483
00:48:51,902 --> 00:48:53,540
Hold fast.

484
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:37,359
He's still up there. Why isn't he leaving?

485
00:49:37,682 --> 00:49:40,162
Why won't he just go away?

486
00:49:41,018 --> 00:49:42,622
I don't know.

487
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:49,730
He's up to something.

488
00:49:50,328 --> 00:49:52,330
What could he be up to?

489
00:49:53,898 --> 00:49:56,572
Why's he still standing there?

490
00:50:33,437 --> 00:50:35,212
That's what he's doing.

491
00:50:37,074 --> 00:50:39,987
- He's waiting.
- Waiting for what?

492
00:50:41,612 --> 00:50:42,762
The rest of them.

493
00:51:25,723 --> 00:51:26,963
Hey, look, there it is.

494
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:30,401
The water tower over there.
Do you see it?

495
00:51:31,662 --> 00:51:34,939
- Once we're past that, we're out of Kingsville.
- Then we'll be safe?

496
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:38,569
- Safe from the sick people?
- That's right, sweetie. Safe from the sick people.

497
00:51:56,821 --> 00:51:59,927
- Why are all those people headed back?
- I don't know.

498
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:05,101
I thought you said we couldn't stay,
that it was dangerous.

499
00:52:05,262 --> 00:52:06,605
Maybe everything's okay now.

500
00:52:06,764 --> 00:52:09,438
- You think that's possible?
- I don't know.

501
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:14,510
Gotta be able to get something.

502
00:52:14,672 --> 00:52:16,413
Maybe A.M.?

503
00:52:18,609 --> 00:52:19,759
Ray, watch out!

504
00:52:29,987 --> 00:52:33,332
<i>All civilians in Kingsville must

This is for your own safety.</i>

512
00:53:00,818 --> 00:53:03,059
Um, what's a quarantine?

513
00:53:04,255 --> 00:53:06,360
Quarantine.

514
00:53:06,524 --> 00:53:08,765
It means they're not letting us out.

515
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You mean we're trapped in here?
<i>The CDC is working closely with the
National Guard to support the deployment...</i>

516
00:53:54,371 --> 00:53:58,217
Dad, they're here.

517
00:54:30,941 --> 00:54:32,818
Darlene's not gonna hold.

518
00:54:32,977 --> 00:54:34,923
We need something else.

519
00:54:46,657 --> 00:54:49,763
Run!

520
00:54:53,998 --> 00:54:56,000
- Get Zoe to the bedroom. Go!
- Hold on!

521
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:04,315
That's not gonna last long.

522
00:55:04,475 --> 00:55:06,546
Ray. Help me!

523
00:55:17,221 --> 00:55:19,565
- Hold long is that gonna last?
- A couple minutes.

524
00:55:19,723 --> 00:55:21,634
- Gotta get out!
- They're blocking the door.

525
00:55:21,792 --> 00:55:25,399
Mom, Dad.
The door's not the only way out.

526
00:55:28,966 --> 00:55:30,411
The periscope.

527
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:36,416
- We can fit.
- I don't know about you.

528
00:55:36,573 --> 00:55:38,075
I'll be fine.

529
00:56:07,905 --> 00:56:09,612
Okay, Ray. It's clear. Get ZoZo.

530
00:56:09,773 --> 00:56:11,047
- You ready?
- Get ZoZo!

531
00:56:12,142 --> 00:56:14,713
- Come on.
- Ray, now.

532
00:56:14,878 --> 00:56:17,586
- Okay, watch your head.
- No.

533
00:56:19,683 --> 00:56:21,594
- You got her?
- Got her!

534
00:56:28,792 --> 00:56:30,032
Okay, she's up. Come on.

535
00:56:37,534 --> 00:56:39,138
I can't fit.

536
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:49,318
I can't fit.

537
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,630
Oh, come on.

538
00:56:54,051 --> 00:56:57,328
Drop it! Hold tight!

539
00:57:02,426 --> 00:57:06,670
- Oh, God.
- Dad? Dad! Dad!

540
00:57:08,766 --> 00:57:11,679
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

541
00:57:12,402 --> 00:57:14,109
I'm okay.

542
00:57:36,627 --> 00:57:39,039
- Ray!
- Remember our promise.

543
00:57:40,297 --> 00:57:41,503
Zoe comes first.

544
00:57:52,142 --> 00:57:56,454
Come on. Come on!

545
00:57:56,613 --> 00:57:58,149
Ray! Ray!

546
00:57:58,315 --> 00:58:02,388
No, Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

547
00:58:04,087 --> 00:58:06,465
Daddy!

548
00:58:11,094 --> 00:58:14,075
- No! No! Dad! Let me go!
- There's nothing we can do.

549
00:58:14,231 --> 00:58:16,973
- We can help him!
- I promised him that I'd protect you!

550
00:58:17,134 --> 00:58:19,614
- I promised him that I'd protect you!
- I don't care!

551
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:23,081
- I promised him!
- I hate you! I hate you!

552
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,084
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
- Let me go.

553
00:58:26,243 --> 00:58:27,984
It's okay.

554
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:39,096
- We have to run.
- What?

555
00:58:39,256 --> 00:58:40,701
Run!

556
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,075
- Olive! Olive!
- ZoZo! Come back!

557
00:58:54,771 --> 00:58:57,342
Run!

558
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:17,366
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

559
00:59:17,527 --> 00:59:20,064
Come on. Come on.

560
00:59:29,072 --> 00:59:30,847
Where are we?

561
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:34,113
Where it all started.

562
00:59:50,527 --> 00:59:53,133
- What do we do?
- Run! Keep running!

563
01:00:09,513 --> 01:00:11,322
The Breathers. They're coming!

564
01:00:22,192 --> 01:00:23,933
She dreamed they found us.

565
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:29,277
They're still looking for us.

566
01:00:35,305 --> 01:00:38,479
They hate us a lot, don't they?
To keep hunting us like that.

567
01:00:38,642 --> 01:00:41,782
- They've always traveled in groups.
- Well, I can fight them.

568
01:00:41,945 --> 01:00:44,016
- That's suicide.
- What's a quarantine?

569
01:00:44,181 --> 01:00:47,788
- It means they're not letting us out.
- The Breathers.

570
01:01:20,817 --> 01:01:22,728
Let us go!

571
01:01:22,886 --> 01:01:26,265
Let us go! Let us go!

572
01:01:26,423 --> 01:01:29,165
- Test them.
- Let us go! Let us out!

573
01:01:52,916 --> 01:01:55,863
Mom, it's an earthquake.

574
01:01:56,586 --> 01:01:59,294
No, sweetie, it can't be.

575
01:02:00,057 --> 01:02:02,628
Kingsville doesn't have earthquakes.

576
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:16,478
Why the hell does the CDC
need military jets?

577
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,812
They're turning around.

578
01:02:31,288 --> 01:02:34,269
They just told everyone
to go back into town.

579
01:02:35,792 --> 01:02:37,897
Mom, Dad, they're coming.

580
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,701
Come on! We gotta get out of here!

581
01:02:44,301 --> 01:02:46,611
No, no, no! It's too far to walk there!

582
01:02:52,976 --> 01:02:55,980
- Kingsville Elementary! There's a shelter.
- What?

583
01:02:56,146 --> 01:02:59,150
- I don't know if it's safe.
- Well, it's safer than here.

584
01:02:59,316 --> 01:03:00,761
Come on!

585
01:03:11,294 --> 01:03:13,171
- We gotta go, guys.
- Come on. Come on.

586
01:03:26,143 --> 01:03:27,293
- Where is it?
- There!

587
01:03:27,377 --> 01:03:29,288
- Where's the door?
- There.

588
01:03:37,888 --> 01:03:41,529
- They're coming! Hurry!
- Ray! Hurry!

589
01:03:44,794 --> 01:03:46,398
Let's go. Come on. I got you now.

590
01:03:47,464 --> 01:03:48,670
Claire, come on. Come on!

591
01:03:52,502 --> 01:03:53,947
Claire!

592
01:04:08,418 --> 01:04:11,797
Are you okay? Claire, are you okay?

593
01:04:13,156 --> 01:04:15,136
Yeah, I'm okay.

594
01:04:16,493 --> 01:04:17,767
- You guys?
- Yeah.

595
01:04:17,928 --> 01:04:21,535
Yeah. Yeah, we're... We're okay.

596
01:04:21,698 --> 01:04:23,302
We're okay.

597
01:04:46,523 --> 01:04:48,662
Oh, they have everything here.

598
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,707
Oh, look at all this food.

599
01:05:06,376 --> 01:05:08,378
Hey, Zoe.

600
01:05:11,047 --> 01:05:12,856
Look at all this.

601
01:05:14,651 --> 01:05:15,857
Huh?

602
01:05:19,623 --> 01:05:21,899
There's...

603
01:05:22,058 --> 01:05:24,561
- There's books and games and...
- Hey, Dad?

604
01:05:24,728 --> 01:05:27,902
More toys, that... Yeah?

605
01:05:29,866 --> 01:05:32,346
How long do we have to stay here?

606
01:05:36,273 --> 01:05:38,014
I don't know.

607
01:05:38,742 --> 01:05:41,279
Not... Hopefully not very long.

608
01:05:42,512 --> 01:05:46,983
We just gotta wait
till they clear this up. And then...

609
01:05:48,685 --> 01:05:50,255
Honey...

610
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,266
what happened up there was a mistake.

611
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:58,402
It was a terrible, terrible mistake.

612
01:05:58,862 --> 01:06:00,808
It wasn't a mistake.

613
01:06:05,468 --> 01:06:07,277
The shelter door, it cut me.

614
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,988
The virus must have gone airborne.
We're infected.

615
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:34,464
Please, just let us go. Just let us go.

616
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:38,602
You cooperate, answer my questions, I'll do
what I can to help you and your daughter.

617
01:06:38,768 --> 01:06:40,748
- Do you understand?
- Yes. Yes.

618
01:06:40,904 --> 01:06:43,077
That shelter,
how long have you been there?

619
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:44,513
Since the beginning.

620
01:06:44,674 --> 01:06:47,746
Did you ever come into contact
with anyone else? Family? Neighbors?

621
01:06:47,911 --> 01:06:50,915
- It was only us.
- Dad says we're the only ones left.

622
01:06:53,049 --> 01:06:57,259
Zoe. I have a little girl about your age.

623
01:06:58,822 --> 01:07:00,893
Goddamn shame.

624
01:07:05,228 --> 01:07:06,536
No.

625
01:07:06,696 --> 01:07:08,232
You said you would help us.

626
01:07:08,398 --> 01:07:10,537
- On my order.
- I won't let you touch her.

627
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,408
I won't let you touch her!
I will not let you touch her!

628
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,379
I won't let you touch her! I will not!

629
01:07:15,538 --> 01:07:18,178
- I will not let you touch her!
- Mom! Never lose control!

630
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:19,945
- Keep away!
- It's too dangerous!

631
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:21,260
Keep away. Keep away.

632
01:07:21,411 --> 01:07:23,550
Remember rule number two:
Never lose control.

633
01:07:23,713 --> 01:07:25,715
Keep away.

634
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:30,356
Don't forget rule two, Claire.
No matter what, we have to stay under control.

635
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,558
<i>- We have to stay calm.
- Never let anger take over.</i>

636
01:07:33,723 --> 01:07:35,794
No! No! No!

637
01:07:35,959 --> 01:07:39,330
They're different than we are and that makes
them as scared of us as we are of them.

638
01:07:39,763 --> 01:07:42,209
<i>- We're not animals.</i>
- Sometimes the truth's hidden from us.

639
01:08:03,386 --> 01:08:04,536
Daddy!

640
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:08,133
- Come on!
- Take him out!

641
01:08:35,251 --> 01:08:38,460
<i>All stations,
this is Echo One. Target secure. Target secure.</i>

642
01:08:38,621 --> 01:08:41,534
<i>- How many casualties?
- Four casualties. Two targets contained.</i>

643
01:08:41,691 --> 01:08:44,763
<i>Gunship, QRF are out of bounds.
Miles out. Standby.</i>

644
01:08:44,928 --> 01:08:46,669
<i>Support is on the way.</i>

645
01:10:21,524 --> 01:10:25,301
Stop! You don't have to kill him.
It's okay.

646
01:10:25,461 --> 01:10:26,769
We're...

647
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:31,007
Remember rule number two, ZoZo?
Remember.

648
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,807
You can stop it. You can stop it.
You can stop it, ZoZo.

649
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:38,578
You can stop it, Zoe. That's it.
Come back to me.

650
01:10:38,741 --> 01:10:42,154
Come back to me. Zoe.

651
01:10:44,213 --> 01:10:45,590
That's it, that's it.

652
01:10:50,086 --> 01:10:51,759
Hey.

653
01:10:53,189 --> 01:10:55,965
- Mom?
- Yeah. It's me.

654
01:10:57,594 --> 01:11:02,065
- You saved me. Protected me.
- I know.

655
01:11:02,231 --> 01:11:05,542
- You called me Zoe.
- I know. Come here.

656
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:14,178
Hey, come on. We gotta go.

657
01:11:15,011 --> 01:11:16,513
Careful.

658
01:11:17,413 --> 01:11:20,189
You're hurt. Here.

659
01:11:22,318 --> 01:11:23,490
Thank you.

660
01:11:30,059 --> 01:11:32,061
What do we do with him?

661
01:11:33,463 --> 01:11:34,613
We let him live.

662
01:11:54,717 --> 01:11:58,130
Mom. Look.

663
01:12:02,792 --> 01:12:03,964
Daddy.

664
01:12:05,962 --> 01:12:07,339
Daddy.

665
01:12:32,288 --> 01:12:34,234
I love you.

666
01:12:36,192 --> 01:12:37,830
I love you.

667
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:53,679
Daddy.

668
01:12:55,311 --> 01:12:56,722
Daddy.

669
01:12:58,347 --> 01:13:00,588
I'm not leaving you.

670
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:08,332
And if... I know I'm not going far.

671
01:13:11,027 --> 01:13:14,167
- No.
- You can always visit me.

672
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:15,968
Yeah.

673
01:13:22,705 --> 01:13:26,448
Just take a trip.

674
01:13:36,986 --> 01:13:38,522
No.

675
01:13:42,859 --> 01:13:44,634
Are you there?

676
01:13:46,729 --> 01:13:48,333
Are you there?

677
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:00,386
No, Daddy.

678
01:14:03,946 --> 01:14:06,187
No, no.

679
01:14:12,021 --> 01:14:14,661
No. No.

680
01:14:24,033 --> 01:14:27,503
We can't stay here, sweetie.
We have to go.

681
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:31,641
- Where?
- We have to hide.

682
01:15:39,108 --> 01:15:41,679
Mom. Mom.

683
01:15:42,311 --> 01:15:44,052
Are you awake?

684
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:47,556
Mom. Mom.

685
01:15:48,251 --> 01:15:52,495
Zoe? What are you doing up already?

686
01:15:52,655 --> 01:15:54,692
Go back to sleep.

687
01:15:54,857 --> 01:15:58,430
I can't. Olive is scared.

688
01:16:06,969 --> 01:16:08,744
What is it?

689
01:16:09,272 --> 01:16:11,445
- What's wrong with Olive?
- We heard something.

690
01:16:11,607 --> 01:16:13,644
- I think a Breather's coming.
- No, sweetie.

691
01:16:13,809 --> 01:16:15,413
You were having another nightmare.

692
01:16:16,812 --> 01:16:18,553
Quick, honey.

693
01:16:18,714 --> 01:16:22,287
<i>Marco! Marco!</i>

694
01:16:22,451 --> 01:16:23,987
Polo?

695
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:29,800
Joey Neary?

696
01:16:30,726 --> 01:16:32,399
I found you.

697
01:17:01,424 --> 01:17:03,370
Who's down there?

698
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,680
Joey, where've you been?

699
01:17:13,402 --> 01:17:14,552
My God.

700
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:18,116
Ted.

701
01:17:24,847 --> 01:17:27,987
- Are they all different like us?
- Yeah.

702
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:30,323
But it's normal here.

703
01:17:33,422 --> 01:17:35,026
Come on.

704
01:17:41,564 --> 01:17:44,841
- Do you see it?
- See what?

705
01:17:46,802 --> 01:17:48,008
The sun.

706
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:58,757
That means it's 302 now.
Three hundred and two days.

707
01:17:59,348 --> 01:18:01,328
Not days.
