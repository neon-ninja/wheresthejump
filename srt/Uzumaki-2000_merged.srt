1
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:33,272
Kurouzu Town, my hometown.

2
00:00:34,282 --> 00:00:35,874
What I'm going to tell you

3
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,885
is a strange story which
took place in this town.

4
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:29,495
Vortex

5
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:55,929
Lost again.

6
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,293
CHAPTER I: PREMONITION

7
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:25,419
Oh no!

8
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

9
00:03:18,312 --> 00:03:19,301
Jesus!

10
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:21,345
Yamakuchi.

11
00:03:21,582 --> 00:03:22,446
Did I scare the hell out of you?

12
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,617
Looks like you're scared

13
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:24,740
You can't blame me!

14
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,251
Are you mad? I like scaring people.

15
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:30,414
I see. What a hobby!

16
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:34,828
What?

17
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,392
Kirie...will you be my girl?

18
00:03:42,103 --> 00:03:47,632
You scared me this time,
I'm in a rush.

19
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:50,976
Kirie!

20
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:54,377
I'm not joking, I really like you.

21
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:21,102
Isn't that Shuichi's father?

22
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,424
How are you?

23
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:52,004
Oh.

24
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:42,447
Here you are, I won today.

25
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:05,202
The bike can only carry one
at a time!

26
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:09,016
Huh?

27
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,138
Narumon rolls
Comestibles spirals.

28
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:25,189
How are you?

29
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,227
Welcome back.

30
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,991
It's all tidied up.

31
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:32,493
I really appreciate that.

32
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:39,905
The sign is gone.

33
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:43,276
Right, it's gone.

34
00:07:55,823 --> 00:08:00,726
Why do we have exams?

35
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,996
It must be great to be
as smart as Shuichi.

36
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:08,296
When I was in junior school,
as long as I attended class,

37
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:10,332
I managed to do well in the exam
even without studying hard.

38
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:13,301
That's not quite the case
after I went to high school.

39
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:16,938
Especially with Maths,
it's an absolute puzzle.

40
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:19,136
If Really gives me a mind block.

41
00:08:22,283 --> 00:08:23,147
Hey.

42
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:26,151
Yeah...oh.

43
00:08:28,622 --> 00:08:31,250
Just now I saw your father
in the alley.

44
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,795
He was filming snail shells
with a video cam.

45
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:44,862
But it was kinda dark,
it might have been someone else.

46
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:50,803
That's my father,
he's been acting a bit funny lately.

47
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,338
No, it's all right.

48
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:10,096
Shuichi, you're not quite yourself
lately.

49
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:13,366
Overworked because of
the admission exam?

50
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:17,099
Relax.

51
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:22,903
You've always done well, you can
enter any university you like.

52
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:23,907
Kirie,

53
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,506
Do you want to run away with me?

54
00:09:27,648 --> 00:09:29,673
Run away?

55
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:33,283
You shouldn't do things like that.

56
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:39,290
There's priorities for everything ...

57
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:48,164
Never mind, let's go home, okay?

58
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:50,160
Shuichi.

59
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:16,186
480 yen, thank you.

60
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,194
Yes.

61
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,192
Yes.

62
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:22,464
Yes.

63
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:27,171
20 yen, thank you.

64
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:28,036
Right.

65
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:32,409
I heard that your dad won
a special prize.

66
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:35,477
Yes, isn't it great?

67
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:40,243
We should now address your dad as
Master Gosima.

68
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:42,284
Please don't say that.

69
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:45,257
I've prepared a gift for you.

70
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:52,696
Really?

71
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,227
Yes, just as a celebration.

72
00:10:56,136 --> 00:10:57,194
Thank you very much.

73
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:17,390
(its) Full of vigour.

74
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:21,227
Mr. Gosima, didn't you
win a prize?

75
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:26,461
It's just coinicidental.

76
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:35,436
Pottery isn't really art.

77
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,436
It would better be called
the art of vortex.

78
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:44,875
Art of vortex?

79
00:11:52,559 --> 00:12:01,866
Like a vortex!
I always feel dizzy doing it!

80
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:07,438
Impressive!

81
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:22,283
Could you draw a pattern on that plate
and give it to me?

82
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,923
A plate with a vortex pattren?

83
00:12:26,126 --> 00:12:35,057
Yes, a vortex,
round and round and round.

84
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:37,561
Round and round and round?

85
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,070
Yes.

86
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:44,308
Okay, I'll try doing that.

87
00:12:46,847 --> 00:13:02,218
There's something mysterious
in the vortex.

88
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:05,120
Something mysterious?

89
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,592
Mr. Gosima should be able to understand

90
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:19,971
a vortex is the highest form of art.

91
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:27,982
And you're the artist of
this highest form of art.

92
00:14:09,096 --> 00:14:11,530
Your dessert.

93
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,904
We're being luxurious today.

94
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:23,000
It's from the fruit shop,
as a token to celebrate with.

95
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,771
Really?

96
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:33,544
It's all because of the lucky charm
that you gave me.

97
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:40,922
It's all because of your work.

98
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:46,361
Shuichi's father
was praising you too.

99
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,564
Keep on with the good work.

100
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:50,334
Right.

101
00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:52,630
Enjoy it.

102
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:57,709
So you saw everything.

103
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:07,578
This melon is really lovely.

104
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:17,126
Yes? It's really good.

105
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:18,691
Wonderful.

106
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:23,199
Marvellous.

107
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:32,390
You're my guardian angel.

108
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:39,838
When Mom died ...

109
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:52,819
Kirie, stop crying.

110
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:56,745
Don't cry.

111
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:03,255
I will be your mother.

112
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:10,396
I don't want a boy to be my mother.

113
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,683
Kirie, do you want to run away with me?

114
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:31,356
Run away.

115
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:37,296
Shuichi, I'm waiting.

116
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:11,457
Good morning.

117
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:23,205
Good morning.

118
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:24,407
Good morning.

119
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:36,955
Does Shuichi want to sit the
exam for the University of Tokyo?

120
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:41,793
Why?

121
00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:44,458
I guess so.

122
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:48,833
Haven't you discussed it with him?
That's important.

123
00:19:49,703 --> 00:19:50,761
No.

124
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:53,562
That's not right.

125
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Are you two dating now?
Not really dating.
If you go on with
this wouldn't-care-less manner...

126
00:20:03,283 --> 00:20:03,977
Did I scare the hell out of you?

127
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:11,884
You're hopeless with Kirie,
she already has a boyfriend.

128
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:16,055
I know, Shuichi Saitou.

129
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:20,657
I really want you to be
my girlfirend...

130
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,267
to be envied by the others.

131
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,571
Idiot, you're really pathetic.

132
00:20:26,706 --> 00:20:28,469
Wait.

133
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:30,570
Stop bugging us.

134
00:20:32,546 --> 00:20:33,535
Kirie.

135
00:20:39,352 --> 00:20:41,752
Kirie, that nerd is staring at us.

136
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:45,050
I was "ambushed" by him yesterday.

137
00:20:45,392 --> 00:20:46,290
"Ambushed"?

138
00:20:46,993 --> 00:20:48,824
You must be careful.

139
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:52,554
A girl from another class
was stalked by him.

140
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,458
Really?

141
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:59,034
Because that guy is ...

142
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,932
What?

143
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,307
Love crazed.

144
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:08,110
X rate contact?

145
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

146
00:21:41,114 --> 00:21:42,843
Are you all right? Kirie.

147
00:21:44,184 --> 00:21:48,120
I'm fine, thanks.

148
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:56,018
But it's awful to see
that kind of thing.

149
00:21:56,563 --> 00:22:00,659
Was he trying to perform ...

150
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:07,700
stunts on the staircase?

151
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,051
He's lucky.

152
00:22:22,956 --> 00:22:23,854
Sekino.

153
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:42,541
Isn't it lucky to be
the centre of focus?

154
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:48,946
Life is meaningless if
no one pays attention to you.

155
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:52,578
It's such pleasure to be watched.

156
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,717
Don't you think so?

157
00:22:56,956 --> 00:22:59,083
I don't like attention.

158
00:22:59,225 --> 00:23:01,216
Besides, he's dead already.

159
00:23:03,997 --> 00:23:06,659
He can't draw attention
without being dead.

160
00:23:08,568 --> 00:23:13,028
I love drawing others' attention,
especially lately.

161
00:23:15,108 --> 00:23:18,441
To be honest,
I want to be the focus.

162
00:23:25,285 --> 00:23:28,220
That's a spiral staircase.

163
00:23:28,822 --> 00:23:30,050
How do you know?

164
00:23:30,523 --> 00:23:31,581
A vortex.

165
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:33,518
Vortex?

166
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:47,632
What about the vortex?

167
00:23:56,216 --> 00:24:00,050
Vortex patterns have a puzzling power.

168
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,219
Those attracted want to
attract others as well.

169
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:09,819
That guy must have been attracted
by the vortex.

170
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:15,758
No, I think it's just coincidental.

171
00:24:20,306 --> 00:24:23,605
I have a bad feeling about this town.

172
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:27,839
Going through that tunnel
always makes me dizzy.

173
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:31,315
This town is already cursed.

174
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:37,521
But I don't have
any strange feeling.

175
00:24:56,142 --> 00:25:00,238
Didn't my father visit
your place yesterday?

176
00:25:03,316 --> 00:25:07,047
He wanted my dad to make a plate
with vortex pattern.

177
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,348
Praised by your father,
Dad was vigorous and high-spirited.

178
00:25:10,723 --> 00:25:12,054
So it's the vortex.

179
00:25:14,394 --> 00:25:16,021
You're being imaginative.

180
00:25:16,396 --> 00:25:18,990
A vortex pattern
is nothing extraordinary.

181
00:25:19,132 --> 00:25:21,259
You're saying that because
you don't understand.

182
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,302
sorry.

183
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:30,801
My father is so obsessed that
you could call it sick.

184
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:36,309
He doesn't go to work anymore,

185
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:40,044
he spends his time collecting things
in the shape of vortexes.

186
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,021
He just stares at
all these vortexes.

187
00:25:44,224 --> 00:25:46,385
He won't answer you no matter
how hard you call him,

188
00:25:47,193 --> 00:25:51,061
he just looks at the vortexes.

189
00:25:53,066 --> 00:25:54,397
Last night,

190
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,070
Father was ill.

191
00:26:03,376 --> 00:26:05,310
Mom, you can't go on like this.

192
00:26:08,248 --> 00:26:09,806
He'd better go to the hospital.

193
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:38,198
You must have had a long day today.

194
00:28:28,588 --> 00:28:31,785
Let me have some more Narumon Roll,
please?

195
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:33,891
That's all we have.

196
00:28:34,794 --> 00:28:36,921
What? That's all?

197
00:28:38,097 --> 00:28:39,121
I'm sorry.

198
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,960
You don't have to apologize.

199
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,565
How can you have miso soup without
Narumon Roll?

200
00:29:20,406 --> 00:29:23,068
Father seemed to be satisfied
by that.

201
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,436
It's not funny.

202
00:29:26,512 --> 00:29:27,536
But ...

203
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:37,147
Want to come to my place now?

204
00:29:38,624 --> 00:29:40,023
When you see it, you'll understand.

205
00:29:44,964 --> 00:29:49,264
Idiot.

206
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:26,336
What are you doing?

207
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:28,197
How dare you!

208
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:29,501
Please don't!

209
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:32,106
Father, what happened?

210
00:30:32,512 --> 00:30:36,039
She threw away all my
favourite collections.

211
00:30:36,215 --> 00:30:37,147
I threw them away.

212
00:30:38,451 --> 00:30:40,282
They should be.

213
00:30:41,354 --> 00:30:44,346
What do you mean? What do you know?

214
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:50,622
Please go back to the old you.
Please wake up.

215
00:30:53,699 --> 00:30:57,658
Too bad, they're all thrown away!

216
00:30:58,371 --> 00:31:02,603
A vortex is not only about
a material being.

217
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:05,467
I finally came to realize
this philospohy.

218
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:09,305
A vortex can be created.

219
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:12,176
Remember,

220
00:31:13,586 --> 00:31:16,919
a vortex can be expressed by our bodies.

221
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:21,357
Like this.

222
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,778
ACT II: EROSION

223
00:32:12,478 --> 00:32:15,072
What happened? You look terrible.

224
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,645
Haven't you seen Shuichi lately?

225
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:23,987
You guys been fighting?

226
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:27,448
He has someone else?

227
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,188
You're dumped?

228
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,190
Come on, tell me what happened.

229
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:37,063
Ishikawa.

230
00:32:37,136 --> 00:32:38,068
Yes ...

231
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:41,135
You don't care if you fail again?

232
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,350
Mr. Katayama,

233
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:01,817
which class do you think
you're having?

234
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:13,364
Sorry, I did leave home on time.

235
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,829
Sir,

236
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:19,033
that guy walks terribly slowly.

237
00:33:19,845 --> 00:33:22,609
Worse than a snail.

238
00:33:24,116 --> 00:33:24,741
Tsumura.

239
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:26,577
Snail...

240
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,414
Sir, you are fat...

241
00:33:28,554 --> 00:33:31,546
Stop singing.

242
00:33:38,731 --> 00:33:46,831
Why do you come to school
only when it rains?

243
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:54,644
Come to the teachers' room
after school.

244
00:33:54,714 --> 00:33:57,649
It'll take him two years to go to
the teachers' room.

245
00:33:57,783 --> 00:33:59,444
Wouldn't we all have graduated
by then?

246
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:04,512
Anyway, sit down.

247
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:20,567
I'm not siding with Tsumura,
but Katayama is really slow.

248
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:21,502
Ishikawa.

249
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,504
Yes ...

250
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:26,134
I didn't ask you to sit down.

251
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:52,130
Disgusting.

252
00:34:55,775 --> 00:34:59,734
It makes me sick to see you, fatso!

253
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:04,145
Go to hell, you make me mad.

254
00:35:05,351 --> 00:35:06,875
I'm upset.

255
00:35:16,495 --> 00:35:17,757
Stop it.

256
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:23,392
Oyama, Tsumura,
go back to your seats.

257
00:36:13,786 --> 00:36:19,281
It's all right.

258
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

259
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:46,518
Did I scare the hell out of you?

260
00:36:50,022 --> 00:36:51,683
Excuse me.

261
00:36:55,394 --> 00:36:56,884
Would you open it?

262
00:36:57,329 --> 00:36:58,387
I can't accept.

263
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:04,963
Just open it, would you?

264
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

265
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:25,422
Happy?

266
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:26,849
Don't do this again.

267
00:37:28,928 --> 00:37:30,589
Why do you hate me so much?

268
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:36,667
I don't like your so-called hobby.

269
00:37:43,142 --> 00:37:47,101
Kirie, I won't give up.

270
00:37:47,947 --> 00:37:51,041
You will change your feelings
towards me.

271
00:38:56,982 --> 00:38:59,041
Dad, I'm home.

272
00:38:59,184 --> 00:39:00,583
Welcome back.

273
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,448
I'll prepare dinner now.

274
00:39:02,588 --> 00:39:03,555
Kirie.

275
00:39:04,623 --> 00:39:09,651
Could you take this plate to
Shuichi's father?

276
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,788
Any problem?

277
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:18,135
If he doesn't like it,
I can do it again.

278
00:41:12,951 --> 00:41:14,316
Hello?

279
00:41:24,363 --> 00:41:25,295
Shuichi?

280
00:41:47,052 --> 00:41:49,282
Shuichi, are you there? Shuichi.

281
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:02,364
Shuichi?

282
00:42:14,646 --> 00:42:24,612
Where are you? Shuichi ...

283
00:43:19,411 --> 00:43:20,378
It's Kirie.

284
00:43:29,354 --> 00:43:30,150
Kirie.

285
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:34,319
What happened? Kirie.

286
00:43:35,294 --> 00:43:36,886
Kirie, what happened?

287
00:44:04,156 --> 00:44:04,986
Vortex.

288
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,521
Do we know the cause of death?

289
00:44:49,434 --> 00:44:50,924
Wasn't it a heart attack?

290
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,504
I heard it was suicide.

291
00:44:54,339 --> 00:44:57,968
Even the families don't know why.

292
00:44:59,111 --> 00:45:02,740
No autopsy?

293
00:45:03,448 --> 00:45:06,440
So what exactly caused him to die?

294
00:45:09,054 --> 00:45:10,214
Thank you.

295
00:45:19,064 --> 00:45:21,498
Are you all right?
You don't look well.

296
00:45:23,068 --> 00:45:24,763
Neither do you.

297
00:45:27,105 --> 00:45:29,903
It doesn't come as a surprise to me.

298
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I worry more about Mom.
Although she said nothing,

299
00:45:37,816 --> 00:45:41,081
we've plan to leave this town
after the week of mourning.

300
00:45:42,454 --> 00:45:44,547
Madam, what happened?

301
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,417
What's that?

302
00:45:48,994 --> 00:45:52,953
Won't you please stop?
Don't go so far.

303
00:45:53,098 --> 00:45:54,360
Mom, what is it?

304
00:45:56,034 --> 00:45:57,296
Shuichi!

305
00:45:57,436 --> 00:45:59,165
Mom, calm down, what happened?

306
00:45:59,304 --> 00:46:02,569
Shuichi, that! It's Father!

307
00:46:12,017 --> 00:46:13,416
Mom!

308
00:46:13,552 --> 00:46:16,385
Hey...call an ambulance.

309
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:18,551
Mom.

310
00:46:42,614 --> 00:46:43,512
Dragonfly Pond.

311
00:47:05,604 --> 00:47:06,662
Cheer up!

312
00:47:07,506 --> 00:47:08,131
Kirie.

313
00:47:09,407 --> 00:47:11,568
Leave this town as soon as you can.

314
00:47:14,946 --> 00:47:24,582
It's under the curse of the vortex.

315
00:47:24,723 --> 00:47:26,213
What about your mother?

316
00:47:26,725 --> 00:47:29,091
She needs a few days to get over it.

317
00:47:34,633 --> 00:47:37,397
Are you Shuichi Saitou?

318
00:47:39,037 --> 00:47:41,369
Ichirou Tamura, Local News Section,
Midoriyama Newspaper.

319
00:47:41,506 --> 00:47:44,100
What happened is really ...

320
00:47:44,409 --> 00:47:47,173
Do you know about my father?

321
00:47:50,682 --> 00:47:56,484
A few weeks ago,
your father went to our office.

322
00:47:58,623 --> 00:48:04,289
Said he'd like to know about
the history of this town.

323
00:48:05,597 --> 00:48:08,464
I showed him some articles.

324
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,933
Anything peculiar
in the way he acted?

325
00:48:12,571 --> 00:48:13,629
You don't mind?

326
00:48:21,213 --> 00:48:27,550
It's all about the vortex.

327
00:48:32,691 --> 00:48:34,955
I've asked the police

328
00:48:35,427 --> 00:48:37,088
about the cause of death.

329
00:48:37,562 --> 00:48:39,393
What I really want to find out is

330
00:48:39,598 --> 00:48:42,692
why did he kill himself in that way?

331
00:48:43,001 --> 00:48:51,204
I feel that your father's death
has a profound meaning.

332
00:48:51,576 --> 00:48:58,573
Together with the smoke
in the crematorium,

333
00:48:59,618 --> 00:49:06,649
there seems to be
some special association.

334
00:49:09,561 --> 00:49:11,654
I hope you can trust me.

335
00:49:26,778 --> 00:49:27,767
Back then ...

336
00:49:28,146 --> 00:49:29,738
A tape that my father made.

337
00:49:36,288 --> 00:49:38,722
It was rewound when he died.

338
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:32,838
Wait a minute, play it again.

339
00:50:52,263 --> 00:50:53,127
Mirror?

340
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
That's my mom's pocket mirror.
Why did he take out the mirror?
Besides ...

341
00:51:06,644 --> 00:51:09,238
Let me keep the tape.

342
00:51:09,914 --> 00:51:12,314
I'll let you know as soon as
I get anything.

343
00:51:19,491 --> 00:51:21,891
You're always with Shuichi?

344
00:51:23,828 --> 00:51:27,855
Yes, we've been friends all our life.

345
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:35,864
Wonderful, life-long friendship.

346
00:51:42,814 --> 00:51:48,548
He helps me all the time.

347
00:51:50,188 --> 00:51:53,851
He brightens up my days.

348
00:51:54,826 --> 00:52:03,859
However,

349
00:52:09,407 --> 00:52:19,806
I can't do anything for Shuichi.

350
00:52:22,287 --> 00:52:29,989
He has to deal with the situation
himself ...

351
00:52:33,832 --> 00:52:47,200
You're a great support to him.

352
00:52:51,983 --> 00:52:53,245
Support ...

353
00:52:56,788 --> 00:53:03,557
Have confidence, don't give up.

354
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:10,665
Yes.

355
00:53:14,305 --> 00:53:16,466
Let me know when it gets near
where you live.

356
00:53:23,982 --> 00:53:27,247
Take the next right turn.

357
00:53:28,953 --> 00:53:31,046
Right turn.

358
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

359
00:53:39,664 --> 00:53:40,460
Watch out!

360
00:53:43,301 --> 00:53:44,359
Dad!

361
00:53:46,004 --> 00:53:47,062
Are you all right?

362
00:53:50,408 --> 00:53:51,375
I'm fine.

363
00:53:53,111 --> 00:53:55,579
What happened? You're all muddy.

364
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,015
I've brought back some mud
from the pond.

365
00:54:16,968 --> 00:54:17,935
Dad.

366
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

367
00:58:07,265 --> 00:58:08,232
Dad.

368
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:10,766
You'll catch cold!

369
00:58:10,935 --> 00:58:14,200
Don't come over, go to bed now!

370
00:58:14,338 --> 00:58:15,134
But ...

371
00:58:15,273 --> 00:58:17,639
Don't worry, I'm okay, go to bed.

372
00:58:37,662 --> 00:58:38,287
Yes.

373
00:58:43,835 --> 00:58:44,859
Yes, okay.

374
00:58:48,406 --> 00:58:49,270
Kirie ...

375
00:58:49,407 --> 00:58:51,739
Have you studied for
the Biology Test tomorrow?

376
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,601
You haven't forgotten, have you?

377
00:59:06,624 --> 00:59:09,115
Okay, next.

378
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:14,764
Kirie, you seem to be
quite distracted lately.

379
00:59:19,937 --> 00:59:22,371
Hey, look.

380
00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:27,969
Sekino's hair is all set and curly
even in the morning.

381
00:59:34,819 --> 00:59:35,581
Yes.

382
00:59:48,065 --> 00:59:49,225
Impressive.

383
00:59:50,434 --> 00:59:52,425
Good for you, Sekino.

384
01:00:08,953 --> 01:00:12,218
You'll get tired easily,
if you drink so much water.

385
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:13,015
Oyama.

386
01:00:13,224 --> 01:00:13,952
Yes.

387
01:01:40,825 --> 01:01:44,000
Sinking a mirror to the bottom
of a pond, signifies a snake
returning home to its favorite water.

388
01:01:44,025 --> 01:01:45,998
Symbolism. Snake cult.

389
01:02:03,834 --> 01:02:04,562
Mirror, body of a snake ... snake.

390
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,799
Snakes.

391
01:02:20,774 --> 01:02:22,799
Mirror. Snake.

392
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:29,459
Mirror. Snake.
Mirror...Eye of Snake.

393
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:31,498
Snake Worship.
Cult.
"Toshioke" (yearly bucket)

394
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:33,529
Ancient mythology.
Ancient snake cult.

395
01:02:33,529 --> 01:02:35,498
Corporal transformation into a snake.

396
01:02:35,959 --> 01:02:39,498
Suicide. Eternity.

397
01:02:40,529 --> 01:02:42,529
Kurozu turns into 'Town of Death'.
Typhoon destroys Dragonfly Pond.

398
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:45,498
Unprecedented typhoon hits Kurozu.
300 Feared dead.

399
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,195
Large quantity of mirrors excavated
from Dragonfly Pond. Elders speak:
Ancient mirrors and Snake cult.

400
01:02:48,195 --> 01:02:49,565
Catastrophe:

401
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:52,432
Typhoon has caused more than...

402
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:55,369
5.000 dead already,
and it's coming near Japan.

403
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,355
These are all for your mother ...

404
01:03:04,862 --> 01:03:06,489
She likes sweets.

405
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:07,528
Thank you.

406
01:03:19,343 --> 01:03:22,005
My mom can't eat this.

407
01:03:25,483 --> 01:03:26,381
Sorry.

408
01:03:27,618 --> 01:03:28,380
My mom ...

409
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:29,281
will think of Father when she sees
things shaped like vortexes.

410
01:03:33,624 --> 01:03:35,023
I'm sorry.

411
01:03:36,227 --> 01:03:38,457
The hair or the fingerprints
is also in the shape of a vortex.

412
01:03:38,596 --> 01:03:40,621
So don't let Mom see it.

413
01:03:42,666 --> 01:03:43,462
You want it?

414
01:04:00,584 --> 01:04:02,313
Sorry to have you dressed like this.

415
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,120
I've told the hospital to pay
attention to vortex-shaped things.

416
01:04:05,623 --> 01:04:08,023
Mom is paying attention to
vortex-shaped things on her body.

417
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,890
She's afriad of vortexes?

418
01:04:11,962 --> 01:04:13,259
By getting rid of the vortex,

419
01:04:13,664 --> 01:04:17,361
I hope she can be cured
of her vortex phobia.

420
01:04:44,728 --> 01:04:45,387
Mom.

421
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:49,299
Kirie.

422
01:04:53,671 --> 01:05:03,205
Mr. Saitou, please go to the reception
if you're in the hospital premises.

423
01:05:07,685 --> 01:05:08,310
Excuse me.

424
01:05:08,452 --> 01:05:09,077
Yes.

425
01:05:09,153 --> 01:05:10,984
I'm Shuichi Saitou.

426
01:05:11,121 --> 01:05:14,648
Mr. Tamura called, said that
he'd like to contact you.

427
01:05:14,792 --> 01:05:16,225
Thank you.

428
01:05:38,148 --> 01:05:40,139
This is Shuichi.

429
01:05:41,018 --> 01:05:46,979
I've found some important points.

430
01:05:48,058 --> 01:05:50,549
I'm going to Dragonfly Pond now.

431
01:05:51,028 --> 01:05:52,120
Mind if I join you?

432
01:05:52,596 --> 01:05:53,688
I'm on my way.

433
01:06:12,549 --> 01:06:14,176
Another one here ...

434
01:06:21,592 --> 01:06:23,082
Shuichi, what are you doing?

435
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:30,327
If Mom sees this vortex,
the result will be disastrous.

436
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:53,847
Mr. Tamura might have
discovered something.

437
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:09,435
So it's because of this guy ...

438
01:07:09,573 --> 01:07:11,666
you treat me like dirt.

439
01:07:11,842 --> 01:07:13,332
Kirie, who is he?

440
01:07:13,477 --> 01:07:18,608
If you've already chosen him,
I can give up.

441
01:07:18,749 --> 01:07:20,114
We're leaving, get lost.

442
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:29,318
Damn it, Kirie,
to make you remember me always ...

443
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Yamakuchi!
Kirie!

444
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

445
01:08:21,545 --> 01:08:22,341
Kirie.

446
01:08:24,848 --> 01:08:27,282
We used to play here all the time.

447
01:08:32,656 --> 01:08:34,886
Kirie was very timid.

448
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,455
I told you there's a gigantic snake
in the pond ...

449
01:08:38,595 --> 01:08:41,758
girls who came here were eaten.

450
01:08:41,965 --> 01:08:43,865
You were scared to tears.

451
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:51,205
Shuichi, you didn't know what to do.

452
01:08:52,242 --> 01:08:56,975
You said you'd protect me,

453
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
as if things would turn out
the way you wanted them.
If this is not a dream,
people are really dying.

454
01:09:22,639 --> 01:09:26,336
This town is cursed by a vortex.

455
01:09:29,847 --> 01:09:30,745
Kirie.

456
01:09:41,024 --> 01:09:49,932
Shuichi, I'm ... I'm so scared.

457
01:09:56,974 --> 01:09:58,965
I'll protect you.

458
01:10:01,912 --> 01:10:02,879
Shuichi.

459
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:10,167
ACT III: INVASION

460
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:35,219
Yukie...Yukie.

461
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:43,031
In fact, there's still a vortex
in your body.

462
01:13:46,503 --> 01:13:50,234
In the deepest part of your ear.

463
01:13:51,308 --> 01:13:56,871
It wants to turn into vortex
and be asleep in your ear.

464
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:58,511
Don't.

465
01:13:58,715 --> 01:14:05,678
There's still a vortex in
the deepest part of your ear.

466
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:12,986
There's still a vortex in your ear.

467
01:14:14,798 --> 01:14:18,495
Vortex.

468
01:14:22,205 --> 01:14:23,672
Don't.

469
01:14:40,724 --> 01:14:43,215
Vortex again.

470
01:14:44,327 --> 01:14:51,756
People in this town become
black vortexes when they die.

471
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:59,937
Can you see the face?

472
01:15:04,314 --> 01:15:06,305
Oh God, yes you can.

473
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,818
That's it, look.

474
01:15:15,325 --> 01:15:16,314
Mom.

475
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:03,663
This is the latest update
on the typhoon.

476
01:17:08,004 --> 01:17:10,666
Due to unknown reasons, this
year's climate has been abnormal.

477
01:17:10,807 --> 01:17:13,071
There has been no typhoon.

478
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,401
Until now.

479
01:17:14,711 --> 01:17:16,736
We finally have our first typhoon.

480
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Typhoon No. 1 has landed in Japan,
With an hourly speed of 6 to 9 km...

481
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:30,392
"Bizarre, the Horror of Kurouzu Town"

482
01:17:31,461 --> 01:17:33,429
Hello, I'm Chie Maruyama.

483
01:17:33,964 --> 01:17:37,866
I'm in Kurouzu Town which is now
being approached by the typhoon.

484
01:17:38,134 --> 01:17:40,830
Recently, many bizarre incidents
have occurred here.

485
01:17:41,338 --> 01:17:42,464
First of all,

486
01:17:42,839 --> 01:17:48,835
a gigantic snail the size
of a person was found.

487
01:17:49,479 --> 01:17:52,812
"Bizarre! Gigantic snails"

488
01:17:55,418 --> 01:17:56,749
Wait a minute!

489
01:17:59,556 --> 01:18:01,990
What's that? How cute!

490
01:18:02,192 --> 01:18:04,490
It was shot by a student.

491
01:18:10,834 --> 01:18:15,737
It seems to be Katayama
who's in the same grade as me.

492
01:18:15,939 --> 01:18:20,433
A vortex pattern has appeared
on his back.

493
01:18:20,577 --> 01:18:24,343
He only goes to school
on rainy days.

494
01:18:24,481 --> 01:18:27,917
That must be Tsumura,
they're both photogenic.

495
01:18:28,051 --> 01:18:30,246
Just the thought of him
makes one happy.

496
01:18:30,387 --> 01:18:33,879
It must be Tsumura,
gobbling water like this.

497
01:18:34,391 --> 01:18:36,359
He's getting slower and slower,
just like Katayama.

498
01:18:36,493 --> 01:18:38,552
Although my father runs
a fruit and vegetable shop,

499
01:18:38,862 --> 01:18:40,762
he saw "Hitomaimai"
on the trail to the hill.

500
01:18:42,499 --> 01:18:45,935
The gigantic snails are actually
human beings.

501
01:18:46,069 --> 01:18:50,438
The two so-called "Hitomaimai"s

502
01:18:50,573 --> 01:18:55,203
are going in the direction
of the hill.

503
01:18:55,812 --> 01:19:00,442
Teenagers in this town are trying
their best to search for them,

504
01:19:01,918 --> 01:19:06,548
but the bizarre stories of
Kurouzu Town do not end here.

505
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:15,388
Beautiful.

506
01:19:17,467 --> 01:19:24,100
All the incidents have
one thing in common : vortexes.

507
01:19:28,211 --> 01:19:32,944
This town is finished.

508
01:19:35,952 --> 01:19:37,283
Let me get Dad.

509
01:19:38,555 --> 01:19:39,544
Kirie!

510
01:19:41,524 --> 01:19:42,616
I'll go with you.

511
01:19:51,134 --> 01:19:52,226
How much longer will it take?

512
01:19:53,403 --> 01:19:54,495
We're almost there,
the tunnel is just up ahead.

513
01:19:57,207 --> 01:19:58,299
Great, next time let's get
a better car.

514
01:20:08,451 --> 01:20:09,543
That's weird, I can't find the exit.

515
01:20:18,094 --> 01:20:19,186
A vortex.

516
01:20:25,668 --> 01:20:29,195
Just now he was here.

517
01:20:30,473 --> 01:20:32,134
Is he at Tsuyomi's place?

518
01:20:34,077 --> 01:20:35,476
Dad?

519
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:49,622
Where is he?

520
01:21:12,982 --> 01:21:13,914
Dad.

521
01:21:19,689 --> 01:21:21,714
What happened? Shuichi.

522
01:21:44,681 --> 01:21:49,550
Kirie...l'm also surrounded
by a vortex.

523
01:21:53,056 --> 01:21:54,114
Don't come over.

524
01:21:58,761 --> 01:22:03,630
Run, I'm done.

525
01:22:05,201 --> 01:22:10,730
No, we said we'd run together.

526
01:22:11,474 --> 01:22:13,704
Kirie ...

527
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:17,707
Sorry, I can't protect you anymore.

528
01:22:19,015 --> 01:22:21,779
Don't say that, hold on.

529
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:28,548
Kirie, I like you very much.

530
01:22:32,395 --> 01:22:40,769
Shuichi?

531
01:22:54,050 --> 01:23:00,080
Don't, didn't we have a deal?

532
01:23:07,463 --> 01:23:13,766
Didn't you say you'd protect me?

533
01:23:19,842 --> 01:23:27,806
Don't die.

534
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

535
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Be a vortex too.

536
01:23:58,781 --> 01:24:01,545
Be a vortex too.

537
01:24:28,811 --> 01:24:30,676
Kirie.

538
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:38,861
ACT IV: TRANSMIGRATION

539
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:39,425
Kurouzu Town, my hometown.

540
01:27:40,469 --> 01:27:42,460
What I'm going to tell you ...
