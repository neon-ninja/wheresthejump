1
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:45,314
- Honey... did you hear that?
- Hear what?

2
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,734
Barbara?

3
00:03:04,027 --> 00:03:07,325
Did you hear that? I could
have sworn I heard whispering.

4
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:11,285
You're reading my mind, that's all.

5
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:14,265
My thoughts sound like whispers.

6
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:17,836
Yeah? What were you thinking?

7
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,083
I love you, Doc.

8
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,251
You sure make it fun to wake up
before dawn, I'll tell you that.

9
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:44,838
Frank?

10
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:05,623
- Did you finish last night?
- No.

11
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:09,372
Honey, it's a quarter to 6:00.

12
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:11,367
It's important.

13
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:13,412
Okay.

14
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,126
Thanks.

15
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:31,932
Okay.

16
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,278
That's everything.

17
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:37,888
Helium for the balloons!

18
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:41,559
I'm picking up a tank at Harold's
right after I drop you off...

19
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,394
per your instructions.

20
00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:46,163
Did I think of that? Cool.

21
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:49,860
I must be starting to get this
delegating authority stuff.

22
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,217
Well, Mrs. Magoo, I guess that's
why they made you principal.

23
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:56,340
I guess so.

24
00:05:58,177 --> 00:06:02,257
- Honey, don't smoke.
- Come on! You're going to make me crash.

25
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:06,436
I'll quit smoking when you decide
to get pregnant, all right?

26
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:18,609
Guys!

27
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:26,744
- Hi!
- Hi.

28
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,118
- Be careful.
- Here I come.

29
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:36,806
Watch your step.

30
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:44,142
You all right?

31
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,516
Jill!

32
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:54,097
- Who's the chef?
- Oliver.

33
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:56,617
Great, I love burnt hot dogs.

34
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:59,436
Thanks. So when's Ben coming home?

35
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:03,331
Six weeks, four days and nine hours.

36
00:07:05,752 --> 00:07:08,697
- Okay, watch the edges. Don't spill it.
- I got it.

37
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:10,836
Let's take it over here.

38
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:13,702
- Callie, how are you?
- Frank. Good. Good to see you.

39
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:15,474
Where's my helium?

40
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:19,333
- Say you love me, baby.
- Not until you get me my helium.

41
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:22,018
Righty-o. I'll get right on it, dear.

42
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,758
- You go here.
- Okay.

43
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:29,739
There's Jill. I've got
those receipts here.

44
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:33,024
- How you doing?
- How the hell are you?

45
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:36,695
- All right, bye.
- Bye. See you later.

46
00:07:48,382 --> 00:07:50,421
- Barbara!
- Frank!

47
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:54,204
Good morning, Sam.

48
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:57,685
And you must be Cindy.
It's nice to finally meet you.

49
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:02,224
Do you want to take a look around?

50
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:05,486
You'll really love this place.

51
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,820
- Harold.
- Morning, Doc.

52
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,292
- Frank.
- Doc, how the hell are you?

53
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,701
Heading over to the school fair?

54
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:31,996
I have to go to Butler County and
make my rounds at the hospital.

55
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:34,374
You've got to try this
muscle machine I made.

56
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,418
Show everybody how strong you are.

57
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:37,461
I don't know.

58
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:41,723
I should probably sit in the shade
and watch you young guys do it.

59
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:46,400
- See you, tough guy.
- Right.

60
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,064
Okay. Thanks, Jill.

61
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:56,899
We need finger paints.

62
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:59,038
Okay. I'll get them.

63
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:02,418
Just put it on the table.

64
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:18,565
Finger paints. Okay.

65
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,610
Yikes.

66
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:13,766
Well, a civilian pilot
spots the smoke.

67
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:17,971
Then I get here and find two of my
officers passed out like babies.

68
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:21,368
Everything on that side of
the white line is out cold.

69
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:24,728
So somebody starts talking
about chemical weapons...

70
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:28,955
and somebody hits a panic button,
and then you people are calling.

71
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,570
- There you go.
- Look, there is no research lab.

72
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,780
There is no chemical plant.

73
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,827
There is no toxic waste dump.
There is no nuclear plant!

74
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:41,512
- There's no nothing around here.
- Okay.

75
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:47,253
Nothing on the news channels or
news services. Nobody's got it yet.

76
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:48,597
Good.

77
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:53,944
I'm just going to take myself
in there and get a look-see.

78
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:04,948
Ed.

79
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:08,109
- That's Frank McGowan's truck, right?
- What's left of it.

80
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:11,613
- Lucky you weren't in town today, Doc.
- What's going on here?

81
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:14,866
Nobody knows anything,
not even that fed doctor down there.

82
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:18,928
She brought this whole circus with her,
and they don't have a clue.

83
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:36,349
Go on out there and see what
the hell's going on. Be careful.

84
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:38,976
- Stay here?
- Yeah, we're just waiting.

85
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:40,664
All right, good.

86
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:04,643
Pull him back!
Get him out of there! Let's go!

87
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:08,926
Get him down!

88
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,947
- Stay back!
- Excuse me.

89
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:13,639
Hits him like a hammer.
That's all we know.

90
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:16,560
- Some kind of chemical gas?
- No, it can't be.

91
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,707
The edges of the affected
area are well-defined.

92
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:21,440
Stationary.

93
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,542
- Doc, this is Dr. Susan...
- Vurner. Like Turner, with a "V."

94
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:29,782
Epidemiologist,
National Science Foundation.

95
00:13:29,882 --> 00:13:31,993
- Alan Chaffee.
- MD?

96
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:35,722
He's breathing. Good pulse.
I think he just fainted.

97
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,791
Is Midwich affected by this?

98
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:40,335
- My hunch would be, yes.
- My wife's in Midwich.

99
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:44,214
We tried calling for the last six hours.
Nobody picks up or calls out.

100
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:47,861
Could somebody please get me
some blood and urine samples?

101
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:52,408
- What's the call?
- 98.

102
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:56,198
You going? Okay, all right.

103
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:59,788
Just take it easy.
Somebody get him a blanket.

104
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:58,358
What happened?

105
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:04,211
Barbara?

106
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:07,926
Thank God. Are you all right?

107
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:12,104
Sweetheart, are you okay?

108
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:16,184
- I'm cold.
- All right, come on. Let's go home.

109
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

110
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:03,735
No.

111
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:09,085
Heavenly Father...

112
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:12,547
we mourn these lives cut short...

113
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:16,176
without warning or apparent purpose.

114
00:17:16,757 --> 00:17:20,220
We search for a reason and find none.

115
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:25,094
We have become accustomed
to the power of science...

116
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:29,691
so when we were struck down,
we turned to science and asked, "Why?"

117
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,567
But it could not answer.

118
00:17:33,191 --> 00:17:35,896
So now we turn our
eyes toward Heaven...

119
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,983
and seek our comfort
in God's infinite mercy.

120
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,861
Let us pray.

121
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:46,793
"Our Father, who art in Heaven...

122
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,650
"...hallowed be Thy name...

123
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,570
"...Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

124
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,958
"...on Earth as it is in Heaven.

125
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,173
"Give us this day our daily bread...

126
00:17:57,302 --> 00:17:59,496
"...and forgive us our trespasses...

127
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:02,809
"...as we forgive those who
trespass against us...

128
00:18:02,974 --> 00:18:05,378
"...and lead us not into temptation...

129
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:07,296
"...but deliver us from evil.

130
00:18:07,396 --> 00:18:10,257
"For Thine is the kingdom,
and the power...

131
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:13,260
"...and the glory, forever and ever.

132
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,604
"Amen."

133
00:18:56,492 --> 00:18:58,946
Did you ever hear of Charles Fort?

134
00:18:59,453 --> 00:19:03,710
He wrote The Book of the Damned,
about unexplainable things.

135
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,738
Like frogs falling from the sky,
blue snow, red rain...

136
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:09,698
Are you suggesting I read him?

137
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:11,718
No. It's just that...

138
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:15,009
Sometimes mysteries don't get solved.

139
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:18,416
I mean, what if something
like this happens again?

140
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:21,169
I don't know. What do I do?
Can I call you?

141
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:23,640
Well, of course, you can call me.

142
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,404
By the way, I suggest you
read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

143
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,471
Sherlock Holmes once said:

144
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:34,975
"When you've eliminated the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable...

145
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:36,866
"...must be the truth."

146
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:02,017
it's not possible.

147
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:06,237
You made a mistake. Do it again.

148
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:10,306
Well, I don't have a problem
running the tests again...

149
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:14,948
I have felt like this before in the morning.
It is just some kind of bug.

150
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:33,298
Melanie?

151
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:50,745
What's the matter?

152
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:57,833
- Maybe I can help.
- No.

153
00:20:58,251 --> 00:20:59,578
You can't.

154
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:06,952
- There they are!
- Hey, guys!

155
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:09,589
We're empty! We need some more here!

156
00:21:09,763 --> 00:21:11,636
Hi, how are you?

157
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,542
It's good to see you.

158
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:14,886
Hi.

159
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:24,149
Ben, this is fantastic.

160
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:36,703
Callie, look up and smile.

161
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:46,412
Ben, after a year in Japan...

162
00:21:46,512 --> 00:21:50,176
did you ever think you'd have
to get used to being a dad?

163
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,327
Hello, Doc.

164
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,670
I said, "Hello."

165
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:20,008
- How long have you been standing there?
- Ages.

166
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,376
Liar.

167
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:25,975
Big boy.

168
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:34,391
Why are you kissing me like that?

169
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,064
I wanted to know first,
so I used a home pregnancy kit.

170
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:42,737
Honey, you know those are unreliable.

171
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,406
And that's why I went to see
Dr. Cornright just to make sure.

172
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:48,243
Are you going to open it?

173
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,464
Alan?

174
00:23:08,227 --> 00:23:10,129
Hi. You got a minute?

175
00:23:10,229 --> 00:23:11,473
Sure.

176
00:23:24,578 --> 00:23:26,534
Everything's positive.

177
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,961
You are pregnant.

178
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:37,425
We'd been trying, you know.

179
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:39,634
Look.

180
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:44,259
I wanted to tell you something before
you hear it from somebody else.

181
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:46,753
There are a lot of pregnancies.

182
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:48,773
I mean, a lot.

183
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:53,269
Much more than would
normally be expected.

184
00:23:54,485 --> 00:23:56,324
What do you mean?

185
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:02,948
Is something wrong with my baby?

186
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:07,651
No, it's nothing to indicate that.
You're a normal, healthy young woman...

187
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:10,916
Alan, don't talk to me like a doctor.

188
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,207
Okay.

189
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,830
All the pregnancies seem to date
from the day of the blackout.

190
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,601
No!

191
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:34,555
Dr. Susan Vurner has flown in...

192
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:37,786
This is all because of
that blackout, isn't it?

193
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:42,313
- Just come out and say something!
- They don't know for sure!

194
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:44,749
They are all going to be deformed!

195
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,905
Wait a minute. That's not true!

196
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:53,534
Excuse me! That's not true.
There's no reason to believe that.

197
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:56,538
Barbara and I are pregnant.
We know how you feel.

198
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:59,499
We know what you are thinking,
so let me say right now...

199
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,335
the same thing I've told
a lot of you individually.

200
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:05,339
The standard tests have not
revealed one abnormality.

201
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:08,217
Anywhere. Not one. All right?

202
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:11,471
Let's listen to Dr. Vurner, please.

203
00:25:11,571 --> 00:25:15,449
She's come to talk to us.
Dr. Susan Vurner, ladies and gentlemen.

204
00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:22,501
I want to start off by saying we are all
very concerned about your well-being.

205
00:25:24,543 --> 00:25:28,090
But ultimately it will come
down to individual decisions.

206
00:25:28,548 --> 00:25:32,660
And I understand that these decisions
will be probably the most intimate...

207
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,351
personal, difficult decisions
that you ever make in your life.

208
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:42,379
However, because your pregnancies have
attracted intense scientific interest...

209
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:46,510
including the National institutes of
Health and National Science Foundation...

210
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,906
those of you who decide
to have your child...

211
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:52,599
will have all prenatal expenses paid.

212
00:25:52,699 --> 00:25:56,743
You'll also receive $3,000
monthly as an allowance.

213
00:25:58,998 --> 00:26:04,529
If you allow your child to be examined
and tested on some sort of regular basis.

214
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,407
Is that $3,000 a family?

215
00:26:07,507 --> 00:26:10,577
What if your wife and your
daughter both have kids?

216
00:26:10,677 --> 00:26:13,345
Then you would receive $6,000.

217
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:15,970
$6,000?

218
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:24,561
I don't want you to interpret this
allowance as some sort of a pressure.

219
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:26,595
It isn't. It's your decision.

220
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:32,033
If you decide to terminate then,
of course, you have the right to do that.

221
00:26:32,743 --> 00:26:34,478
You can do it privately.

222
00:26:34,578 --> 00:26:38,742
Or if financially unable, a medical
team will be brought in next week.

223
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:42,048
- The choice is yours.
- That's killing babies.

224
00:26:48,678 --> 00:26:50,847
Are you okay?

225
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:54,261
Ben's moving out.

226
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:58,398
He won't believe me.

227
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:02,653
What are you going to do?

228
00:27:04,194 --> 00:27:05,949
I can't keep it.

229
00:27:06,865 --> 00:27:09,200
I mean, it can't be Ben's.

230
00:27:10,451 --> 00:27:12,538
I just don't...

231
00:27:12,745 --> 00:27:15,081
I just don't understand.

232
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:20,582
Something very strange is
happening to all of us, Callie.

233
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:24,926
You know, they say...

234
00:27:25,594 --> 00:27:28,095
the Roberts' girl is a virgin.

235
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,936
What are you going to do?

236
00:27:34,144 --> 00:27:35,768
I don't know.

237
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:40,279
I don't know.

238
00:28:35,963 --> 00:28:38,298
- You all right?
- Yeah.

239
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:43,346
It was just a dream.

240
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,467
Okay.

241
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,647
Let's go back to sleep.

242
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,370
What's going on, doctor?

243
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,582
Nothing.

244
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:11,336
They have apparently decided
to keep their babies.

245
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:12,959
All of them?

246
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:14,752
Why?

247
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:17,920
That's a very good question.

248
00:30:34,008 --> 00:30:36,297
Keep pushing! Push!

249
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:39,373
Okay, here we go. Here we go. Almost.

250
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:42,293
Almost done! Good, Mom. That's good.

251
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:44,764
Push, push, push.

252
00:30:50,443 --> 00:30:52,234
That's it. That's it.

253
00:30:54,364 --> 00:30:56,851
You're doing great!
Take a deep breath.

254
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:58,769
Deep breath and push!

255
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:00,825
Push, push, push!

256
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:03,789
Come with that. Push a little more.

257
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:07,696
- Push, Barbara, push.
- A little more. A little more.

258
00:31:07,796 --> 00:31:09,966
Push. Push.

259
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:17,058
Help me!

260
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:19,644
We've got a problem!

261
00:31:20,894 --> 00:31:23,146
ICU, now!

262
00:31:34,408 --> 00:31:36,531
- Push, push, push!
- Come on!

263
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:38,897
- There we go!
- Good, Barbara!

264
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,524
And there we go.

265
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:42,526
Beauty! Looking great, sweetie.

266
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:44,110
Good job.

267
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,965
It's a girl, honey.

268
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:48,547
She's fine.

269
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:56,052
- There we are. Clamp this.
- Look, here's your baby.

270
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:05,267
He's beautiful.

271
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,504
Ben.

272
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,660
Come on, just breathe once. Oxygen.

273
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,092
- Watch the BP.
- Just relax. You're hyperventilating.

274
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:36,680
Push. Doctor, get your ass
over here and help me!

275
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,142
Bear down on her! Push!

276
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:44,811
All right, here we go! Come on, push!
Give me one big push!

277
00:32:45,237 --> 00:32:48,071
Come on, here we go! Come on!

278
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:53,197
I'm sorry. It's stillborn.

279
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,547
Get some fluid in her.

280
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,488
How we doing? Everything all right?

281
00:33:39,588 --> 00:33:41,591
We lost the Roberts' baby.

282
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:46,173
- God. How?
- Respiratory failure.

283
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:48,760
Umbilical asphyxia.

284
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:19,115
Where did you take the baby?
I saw you take Melanie's baby outside.

285
00:34:19,215 --> 00:34:23,507
I took the baby for an autopsy.
I didn't want the other mothers to see.

286
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:57,628
I baptize thee...

287
00:34:57,882 --> 00:35:00,118
in the name of the Father...

288
00:35:00,218 --> 00:35:05,009
and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

289
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:09,892
I got you.

290
00:35:11,647 --> 00:35:13,105
Yes.

291
00:35:17,237 --> 00:35:18,695
Let us pray.

292
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:24,645
Heavenly Father, we thank you that
by the water of the Holy Spirit...

293
00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:28,191
you have bestowed upon
your servants, the forgiveness of sin...

294
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:30,902
and have raised them to
the new life of grace.

295
00:35:31,002 --> 00:35:33,905
"Sustain them, O Lord,
in your Holy Spirit.

296
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:36,909
"Give them an inquiring
and discerning heart...

297
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,787
"...the courage to will
and to persevere...

298
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,456
"...the spirit to know
and to love you...

299
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:46,435
"...and the gift of wonder and
joy in all your work. Amen."

300
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:47,977
Amen.

301
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:06,623
Good girl.

302
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,957
That's a good girl.

303
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:14,449
Note how the section of hair is flat
on one side then arced on the other...

304
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:16,803
- ...like a capital "D."
- Right.

305
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:21,475
The texture is... I don't know.
It's unusually soft.

306
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:26,547
What did you think when
you looked at her nails?

307
00:36:26,647 --> 00:36:28,852
Narrower than normal.

308
00:36:29,608 --> 00:36:32,145
Any results yet from the DNA testing?

309
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:34,263
Common genetic characteristics.

310
00:36:34,363 --> 00:36:37,696
Almost as if they are siblings
from the same parent.

311
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:42,624
It's way too early to
have anything conclusive.

312
00:36:45,918 --> 00:36:47,376
Baby.

313
00:36:47,962 --> 00:36:49,834
What are you doing?

314
00:37:04,229 --> 00:37:06,649
You can spell your name.

315
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:12,233
How can you spell your name?

316
00:37:15,326 --> 00:37:17,447
How can Mommy's...

317
00:37:17,953 --> 00:37:20,704
smart little boy spell his name?

318
00:37:32,302 --> 00:37:34,589
Sweetie, was the soup too hot?

319
00:37:47,736 --> 00:37:49,388
Okay, baby.

320
00:37:49,488 --> 00:37:52,618
We're going to go see our friend Mara.

321
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:45,378
Barbara?

322
00:39:01,317 --> 00:39:03,107
Are you crazy?

323
00:39:14,664 --> 00:39:17,369
Honey, can't you tell
me what happened?

324
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,612
Don't!

325
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:16,333
No! God, no!

326
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:29,149
I understand there are recent
developments at Midwich.

327
00:41:30,189 --> 00:41:31,777
Yes.

328
00:41:32,024 --> 00:41:35,679
The children are beginning to interact
more with the general community.

329
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:37,430
There have been casualties...

330
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,683
I should say accidents, suicides...

331
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:42,477
that might be related to
contact with the children.

332
00:41:42,577 --> 00:41:45,197
But no direct physical
violence was involved.

333
00:41:45,623 --> 00:41:49,880
I have also been trying unsuccessfully
to get Dr. Chaffee back on the program.

334
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:52,321
His daughter's the leader, isn't she?

335
00:41:52,421 --> 00:41:54,448
He's probably got his hands full.

336
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:57,335
Personal considerations
aren't important, are they?

337
00:41:58,303 --> 00:42:02,165
I think that the opportunity to study
these children should take precedent...

338
00:42:02,265 --> 00:42:04,387
over any considerations.

339
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:07,881
Let's cut to the chase here.

340
00:42:07,981 --> 00:42:11,009
It's now of interest to national
security that we continue...

341
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:14,192
to carefully monitor
their developing powers.

342
00:42:17,157 --> 00:42:19,409
I ask for another year's grant.

343
00:43:33,532 --> 00:43:35,703
Good afternoon, children.

344
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,039
Why do you smile?

345
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:45,297
You're trying to hide
your thoughts from us.

346
00:43:46,923 --> 00:43:48,908
Just how deeply do you see?

347
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:51,953
Everything active in your mind.

348
00:43:52,053 --> 00:43:56,311
But the process that leads to
the spoken words eludes us.

349
00:43:56,558 --> 00:44:00,851
Why do you speak some
thoughts and not others?

350
00:44:02,064 --> 00:44:05,443
Wouldn't it be a noisy world if
we said everything we thought?

351
00:44:17,206 --> 00:44:19,162
Okay, I'm going to put a drop of
this in your eyes; it won't hurt.

352
00:44:57,709 --> 00:44:59,486
I'm sorry. Calm down!

353
00:44:59,586 --> 00:45:01,921
I'm going to wash your eye out!

354
00:45:02,464 --> 00:45:05,844
Okay, open your eyes! It's all right!

355
00:45:07,303 --> 00:45:09,342
It's okay!

356
00:46:20,591 --> 00:46:22,713
How's the doctor?

357
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:25,599
Corneal scarring.

358
00:46:25,764 --> 00:46:27,666
Most likely permanent blindness.

359
00:46:27,766 --> 00:46:29,585
How did it happen?

360
00:46:29,685 --> 00:46:31,795
Doesn't remember much.

361
00:46:31,895 --> 00:46:34,516
It will be listed as an accident.

362
00:46:36,401 --> 00:46:38,357
It was the children.

363
00:46:38,778 --> 00:46:40,532
There's no proof of that.

364
00:46:41,948 --> 00:46:43,683
What I want to know is...

365
00:46:43,783 --> 00:46:46,404
are the people in this town safe?

366
00:46:47,955 --> 00:46:50,919
- What are they going to do to us?
- Alan.

367
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,694
- Hi.
- This has got to stop.

368
00:46:53,794 --> 00:46:56,406
They don't belong in regular classes.

369
00:46:56,506 --> 00:46:59,672
It's getting dangerous,
the other children can't learn.

370
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,663
I was thinking maybe
you could teach them.

371
00:47:02,763 --> 00:47:05,165
They seem to respect you.

372
00:47:05,265 --> 00:47:06,474
Respect?

373
00:47:06,684 --> 00:47:09,420
No. They don't even know
the meaning of that word.

374
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,935
Why bother? It doesn't make
any difference what we do.

375
00:47:15,361 --> 00:47:17,530
We need you.

376
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,890
What am I going to teach them?

377
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:23,120
What am I possibly
going to teach them?

378
00:47:24,078 --> 00:47:25,750
Humanity.

379
00:47:31,211 --> 00:47:33,380
Humanity.

380
00:47:42,682 --> 00:47:45,385
Hello, sweetheart.

381
00:47:56,656 --> 00:47:58,778
Come on.

382
00:48:27,231 --> 00:48:30,646
There's no need for you
to become emotional.

383
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:34,489
I'm old enough to do things by myself.

384
00:48:51,507 --> 00:48:54,804
Do you want to talk about what
happened at the clinic today?

385
00:48:54,927 --> 00:48:59,269
Why should I be experiencing
emotion at this moment?

386
00:49:01,643 --> 00:49:04,145
What is that word you're thinking?

387
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,315
What is "empathy"?

388
00:49:11,571 --> 00:49:15,100
So if I have felt pain...

389
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,909
I should be able to identify
with others who feel pain.

390
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,462
Yes.

391
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,644
Good night.

392
00:50:47,802 --> 00:50:49,474
What's the matter?

393
00:50:53,266 --> 00:50:55,056
You want some?

394
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,643
I'm sorry.

395
00:51:01,484 --> 00:51:03,689
I just can't hack it.

396
00:51:46,242 --> 00:51:47,450
"God said...

397
00:51:48,202 --> 00:51:51,581
"...Let us make man in our image...

398
00:51:52,373 --> 00:51:54,660
"...after our likeness."

399
00:51:55,669 --> 00:51:58,822
But "image" does not
mean outer image...

400
00:51:58,922 --> 00:52:03,594
or every statue or
photograph would be man.

401
00:52:04,511 --> 00:52:07,595
It means the inner image.

402
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:11,563
The spirit, the soul.

403
00:52:14,272 --> 00:52:16,442
So we gather here today...

404
00:52:16,775 --> 00:52:19,230
to remember the inner beauty...

405
00:52:19,862 --> 00:52:22,139
of one who lost her hold.

406
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,076
Melanie Roberts...

407
00:52:24,366 --> 00:52:28,447
somehow lost that image
of herself as a creature...

408
00:52:28,747 --> 00:52:32,410
made in God's bountiful spirit.

409
00:52:33,585 --> 00:52:36,122
But what of those in our midst...

410
00:52:37,006 --> 00:52:40,255
who do not have individual souls...

411
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:43,180
or spirits?

412
00:52:43,429 --> 00:52:46,083
They have one mind...

413
00:52:46,183 --> 00:52:48,794
that they share between them.

414
00:52:48,894 --> 00:52:51,229
One spirit.

415
00:52:52,522 --> 00:52:55,059
And they have the look of man.

416
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,069
But not the nature of mankind.

417
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:07,040
What are you doing here?

418
00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:09,871
Looking for the baby.

419
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:16,366
The one who was born with us.

420
00:53:16,466 --> 00:53:18,920
The one who died.

421
00:53:20,595 --> 00:53:22,800
How do you know about that?

422
00:53:25,141 --> 00:53:27,063
The baby's not here.

423
00:53:27,186 --> 00:53:28,879
She was taken away.

424
00:53:28,979 --> 00:53:30,603
Where?

425
00:53:30,981 --> 00:53:32,688
I don't know.

426
00:53:37,322 --> 00:53:40,370
Do you have a memory of the baby?

427
00:53:43,537 --> 00:53:45,743
But it bothers you.

428
00:53:48,418 --> 00:53:50,753
It hurts to lose a loved one.

429
00:53:51,921 --> 00:53:54,506
She was to be with me.

430
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:58,596
We were to be together.

431
00:54:01,014 --> 00:54:03,635
How do you know that?

432
00:54:20,244 --> 00:54:22,615
You've lost someone too.

433
00:55:08,714 --> 00:55:10,717
I think I can teach them.

434
00:55:11,467 --> 00:55:13,506
Anyway, I'll try.

435
00:55:14,428 --> 00:55:17,393
I never told David about
the Roberts' baby.

436
00:55:20,268 --> 00:55:21,512
Right.

437
00:55:21,812 --> 00:55:25,226
And then he said,
"she was to be with me"?

438
00:55:25,483 --> 00:55:27,486
What did that mean?

439
00:55:28,027 --> 00:55:29,650
I don't know.

440
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:38,480
Are they paired up...

441
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,501
like a mate?

442
00:56:04,108 --> 00:56:07,821
What can I teach such
bright young students?

443
00:56:09,531 --> 00:56:11,058
What about human physiology?

444
00:56:11,158 --> 00:56:14,519
That's at least something
I know a little bit about.

445
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:17,398
For example, does anybody
here know how the eye works?

446
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:20,151
Do you mean how do we see, or...

447
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,172
Well, what else can the eye do?

448
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:26,506
- The eyes are...
- The eyes are the windows of the soul.

449
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:28,077
Yes.

450
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:31,288
That's right. I see that
you've been reading proverbs.

451
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,142
I was speaking to Robert.

452
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,478
The eyes are the windows of the soul.

453
00:56:46,864 --> 00:56:50,991
All right, if you'd rather talk
about philosophy instead of...

454
00:56:51,202 --> 00:56:54,949
- ...physiology, let's talk about the soul.
- Alan.

455
00:56:55,122 --> 00:56:56,108
Sorry.

456
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:59,207
Can you come to my office
for a minute, please?

457
00:56:59,836 --> 00:57:02,338
Yes. I'll be right there.

458
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:07,175
While I'm away, why don't you each take
out a volume of the encyclopedia...

459
00:57:16,438 --> 00:57:19,771
and try to learn a little
something about our culture.

460
00:57:39,714 --> 00:57:41,634
I know your game.

461
00:57:42,383 --> 00:57:44,619
I know what you're up to.

462
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:47,423
Ever since you got here,
I've been watching.

463
00:57:48,014 --> 00:57:51,043
Watching people leave this town.

464
00:57:51,143 --> 00:57:53,879
Watching things die.

465
00:57:53,979 --> 00:57:56,924
You aren't right. None of you.

466
00:57:57,024 --> 00:58:00,902
And one of these days, somebody's
going to do something about it.

467
00:58:03,531 --> 00:58:06,615
I don't like the way you're
looking at me, boy.

468
00:58:11,206 --> 00:58:14,586
I got a gun, too,
and I'm not the only one.

469
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:18,865
One day somebody's going
to get up on a rooftop...

470
00:58:18,965 --> 00:58:22,452
and start picking you
little bastards off.

471
00:58:22,552 --> 00:58:26,217
One by one by one.

472
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,556
Aren't you going to do something?

473
00:58:41,656 --> 00:58:45,285
Aren't you going to bawl like
all the other little pissants?

474
00:58:46,037 --> 00:58:48,787
Well, do something, damn it!

475
01:00:49,172 --> 01:00:51,709
There are going to be changes.

476
01:01:04,855 --> 01:01:06,777
God help us.

477
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:08,468
The children did it.

478
01:01:08,568 --> 01:01:10,655
I know they did it.

479
01:01:10,779 --> 01:01:12,865
And my daughter was involved.

480
01:01:13,448 --> 01:01:15,619
Now, who are they?

481
01:01:15,952 --> 01:01:18,396
It was their communal consciousness...

482
01:01:18,496 --> 01:01:20,997
Some abrupt evolutionary jump.

483
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:24,085
It was their communal consciousness...

484
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:26,582
but I couldn't explain the blackout.

485
01:01:27,131 --> 01:01:29,418
Or the mass pregnancies.

486
01:01:30,259 --> 01:01:33,258
Midwich isn't the only
colony of such children.

487
01:01:35,557 --> 01:01:39,553
In a township in northern Australia,
30 infants were born in a single day.

488
01:01:40,645 --> 01:01:42,933
They all died within
ten hours of birth.

489
01:01:43,106 --> 01:01:46,985
In an Inuit community near Anchorage,
a group of 10 children were born.

490
01:01:47,486 --> 01:01:51,862
There were 20 births in a small village
near the Turkish-Iranian border.

491
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:54,894
Each location was remote...

492
01:01:54,994 --> 01:01:58,523
isolated, and each had a
blackout the same as Midwich.

493
01:01:58,623 --> 01:02:00,817
And how long have
you known about this?

494
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:03,362
The way I see it,
there are three possibilities.

495
01:02:03,462 --> 01:02:05,740
Number one: parthenogenesis.

496
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,923
The development of a
fetus without fertilization.

497
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:10,828
I know. I don't buy that, either.

498
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:16,043
Two: we do know the CIA slipped doses
of LSD to men without them knowing it...

499
01:02:16,143 --> 01:02:19,505
in order to study the effects of
psychotropes on gene structure.

500
01:02:19,605 --> 01:02:21,965
Maybe the government
engineered the blackout...

501
01:02:22,065 --> 01:02:25,094
then artificially inseminated
your women with super sperm.

502
01:02:25,194 --> 01:02:28,242
First they knocked them out,
then they knocked them up.

503
01:02:30,658 --> 01:02:33,327
And what's the third possibility?

504
01:02:33,453 --> 01:02:36,537
Xenogenesis. Implantation.

505
01:02:36,665 --> 01:02:39,713
The production of an offspring
unlike that of the parent.

506
01:02:40,878 --> 01:02:43,048
Or should I say host?

507
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:24,633
Come back to the project.

508
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Not just a matter of protecting
your daughter. As you can see, it goes...
far, far beyond that.

509
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:37,507
You have to put this in
the back of your mind.

510
01:03:37,607 --> 01:03:39,426
Don't think about it when near them.

511
01:03:39,526 --> 01:03:42,763
- Don't ever let them know that you know.
- Why didn't you tell us?

512
01:03:42,863 --> 01:03:46,077
- I mean, why didn't you warn us?
- Because I couldn't.

513
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:48,394
Well, I couldn't.

514
01:03:48,494 --> 01:03:51,189
If anybody else knew,
the children would know.

515
01:03:51,289 --> 01:03:54,692
Look, I have spent years of my
life building a wall around this.

516
01:03:54,792 --> 01:03:58,072
Hiding it, so they couldn't
read what was in my mind.

517
01:03:58,172 --> 01:04:02,002
But as their powers grow stronger,
they keep looking deeper and deeper.

518
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:05,093
I need your help.
Would you please just...

519
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,968
come back to the project.

520
01:04:59,364 --> 01:05:01,391
We've made our decision.

521
01:05:01,491 --> 01:05:04,656
Discussion will not change our plans.

522
01:05:07,832 --> 01:05:11,211
We will live in the abandoned
barn outside of town.

523
01:05:11,836 --> 01:05:14,123
You will bring us supplies.

524
01:05:14,839 --> 01:05:17,211
You can't stop us, you know.

525
01:05:17,551 --> 01:05:19,388
Don't try.

526
01:05:25,935 --> 01:05:29,184
You've been discussing
us with Dr. Vurner.

527
01:05:29,981 --> 01:05:32,316
What did she tell you?

528
01:05:36,613 --> 01:05:38,653
You are hiding something.

529
01:06:36,429 --> 01:06:38,302
I'm not letting you go.

530
01:06:41,601 --> 01:06:44,766
- You haven't been given an option.
- Have you?

531
01:06:49,568 --> 01:06:53,031
You know, you don't always have
to do everything they tell you.

532
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:56,447
We are the same.

533
01:06:57,369 --> 01:06:58,895
You're not.

534
01:06:58,995 --> 01:07:01,497
You're David. You're different.

535
01:07:34,409 --> 01:07:37,196
I've come to get Julie.
Have you seen her?

536
01:07:40,749 --> 01:07:42,752
Is she at the barn?

537
01:07:44,962 --> 01:07:46,374
Fine.

538
01:08:10,115 --> 01:08:12,071
Are you all right?

539
01:08:12,451 --> 01:08:13,778
I'm sorry.

540
01:08:14,077 --> 01:08:15,999
You're okay, aren't you?

541
01:08:16,122 --> 01:08:18,908
Julie doesn't want to come with you.

542
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:22,332
Damn it, I don't care what Julie wants.
Her mother's frantic.

543
01:08:22,462 --> 01:08:24,548
I'm bringing her home.

544
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:32,123
Some kind of big accident,
Doc, out by the barn.

545
01:09:33,623 --> 01:09:35,711
Alan, wait!

546
01:09:36,419 --> 01:09:40,114
I was just told that the other towns
with blackout children were destroyed.

547
01:09:40,214 --> 01:09:44,035
- What? All of them?
- Everyone in them, the adults and children.

548
01:09:44,135 --> 01:09:46,914
They couldn't evacuate without
the children knowing.

549
01:09:47,014 --> 01:09:50,209
- The governments gave no warning.
- God. What about Midwich?

550
01:09:50,309 --> 01:09:52,544
I've been told to pack and get out.

551
01:09:52,644 --> 01:09:56,523
I'm leaving tonight. Do the same.
Get out while you can.

552
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,740
Another man is dead.

553
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:17,030
Why do you hate us so much, Mara?

554
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:21,506
It isn't a matter of hate.
It is a biological obligation.

555
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:25,623
You are thinking of what
happened to the others.

556
01:10:25,723 --> 01:10:28,126
Then our actions
shouldn't surprise you.

557
01:10:28,226 --> 01:10:31,129
We have to survive no
matter what the cost.

558
01:10:31,229 --> 01:10:32,964
We are the only ones left now.

559
01:10:33,064 --> 01:10:35,467
I don't see why we can't
reach an understanding.

560
01:10:35,567 --> 01:10:37,344
Why can't we just live together?

561
01:10:37,444 --> 01:10:40,097
If we coexist, we shall dominate you.

562
01:10:40,197 --> 01:10:41,932
That is inevitable.

563
01:10:42,032 --> 01:10:44,435
Eventually you will
try to eliminate us.

564
01:10:44,535 --> 01:10:46,980
We are all creatures
of the life-force.

565
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,744
Now it has set us at one another
to see who will survive.

566
01:10:51,668 --> 01:10:54,863
- That's a cruel sport.
- Life is cruelty.

567
01:10:54,963 --> 01:10:59,672
We all feed on each other,
exploit each other in some way to survive.

568
01:11:01,303 --> 01:11:02,872
I don't agree with you.

569
01:11:02,972 --> 01:11:06,001
I think that adaptation
is the key to survival.

570
01:11:06,101 --> 01:11:09,421
Cooperation and symbiosis...

571
01:11:09,521 --> 01:11:11,393
and compassion.

572
01:11:12,274 --> 01:11:16,236
Why do you think your own survival
depends upon emotion from us?

573
01:11:16,362 --> 01:11:18,014
Should we pity you?

574
01:11:18,114 --> 01:11:21,851
- Empathize with your plight?
- You should feel!

575
01:11:21,951 --> 01:11:24,203
You should feel something!

576
01:11:25,413 --> 01:11:27,900
Without feelings, you're nothing.

577
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,047
You're just second-rate
mimics of a higher organism.

578
01:11:31,545 --> 01:11:35,825
That's right, a higher organism.
We're your superiors in our capacity to love.

579
01:11:35,925 --> 01:11:38,870
Without compassion,
you're a doomed species.

580
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:42,682
Emotion is irrelevant.
It is not our nature.

581
01:11:49,273 --> 01:11:51,509
I'm not so sure you're
right about that.

582
01:11:51,609 --> 01:11:54,261
Still, you are aware
of the other colonies.

583
01:11:54,361 --> 01:11:57,641
So you must be, in some basic sense...

584
01:11:57,741 --> 01:11:59,494
aware of who...

585
01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:01,829
what we are.

586
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:05,037
Yes.

587
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:07,527
So the question becomes...

588
01:12:07,627 --> 01:12:10,128
should you be allowed to live?

589
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:19,175
You're suddenly thinking of an ocean.

590
01:12:24,061 --> 01:12:27,690
You're blocking your thoughts
rather effectively with this image.

591
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:33,930
We must leave here,
spread out, disperse.

592
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:38,185
Soon we will have reached a stage
where we can form new colonies.

593
01:12:38,285 --> 01:12:41,451
You will arrange a method of
getting us away from here.

594
01:12:42,373 --> 01:12:44,459
What if I refuse you?

595
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:46,778
You are a prisoner of your values...

596
01:12:46,878 --> 01:12:50,008
and you won't be able to deceive us.

597
01:12:51,007 --> 01:12:52,631
You know that.

598
01:12:52,884 --> 01:12:54,674
Don't you?

599
01:12:56,013 --> 01:12:57,720
Father?

600
01:13:00,726 --> 01:13:01,970
Yes.

601
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,172
Yes, I know that.

602
01:13:04,272 --> 01:13:05,966
Make your arrangements.

603
01:13:06,066 --> 01:13:08,734
We must leave tonight.

604
01:13:35,181 --> 01:13:37,885
You're thinking of the one who died.

605
01:13:38,685 --> 01:13:40,973
She was to be my partner.

606
01:13:42,939 --> 01:13:45,227
Yes, it's true.

607
01:13:45,776 --> 01:13:48,906
Without a mate, you are
of less importance to us.

608
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,861
And your development of
emotions is disturbing.

609
01:13:55,746 --> 01:13:58,710
We can't leave you behind.

610
01:13:59,374 --> 01:14:02,078
It is time we resolved this.

611
01:14:42,505 --> 01:14:44,425
Hurry up!

612
01:14:44,632 --> 01:14:48,662
"Begone, everyone who is
proud, and bring him low...

613
01:14:48,762 --> 01:14:51,540
"...and tread down the
wicked where they stand!"

614
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,501
- This is the last of it.
- All right, get going.

615
01:14:54,601 --> 01:14:57,547
"Bind their faces in the world below.

616
01:14:57,647 --> 01:15:00,049
"Then will I also
acknowledge to you...

617
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:04,526
"...that your own right
hand can give you victory!"

618
01:15:18,086 --> 01:15:20,208
I'm glad you're here.

619
01:15:20,589 --> 01:15:23,921
I wanted to talk to you.
I really think that I can help you.

620
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:50,897
You've got to stop! Please stop!

621
01:15:50,997 --> 01:15:53,498
You got to stop! Sarah, please!

622
01:16:25,536 --> 01:16:28,037
"Hast thou eyes of flesh?

623
01:16:28,831 --> 01:16:31,961
"Dost thou see as man sees?"

624
01:19:07,005 --> 01:19:09,699
A state of emergency
has been declared.

625
01:19:09,799 --> 01:19:11,826
Please return to your homes...

626
01:19:11,926 --> 01:19:15,424
and remain there until further notice.

627
01:19:20,561 --> 01:19:23,976
- Come here! Grab my hand, quick!
- Come on!

628
01:19:25,901 --> 01:19:29,197
People will be arrested.

629
01:19:31,781 --> 01:19:34,485
This is a state of emergency.

630
01:20:10,616 --> 01:20:11,824
Please be home.

631
01:20:17,207 --> 01:20:19,109
The children murdered Sarah.

632
01:20:19,209 --> 01:20:22,696
Susan too. I just found
her at the clinic.

633
01:20:22,796 --> 01:20:24,906
The police are on their
way to the barn.

634
01:20:25,006 --> 01:20:28,221
They're going after the children.
We've got to stop them.

635
01:20:28,386 --> 01:20:31,080
- You can't go. You'll get hurt.
- We've got to try!

636
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:35,521
No. The state police can't do anything
to stop the children. It'll be a bloodbath.

637
01:20:36,186 --> 01:20:38,630
Now, listen to me. Listen to me.

638
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:40,591
There's another way.

639
01:20:40,691 --> 01:20:42,593
Now, look, something happened today.

640
01:20:42,693 --> 01:20:45,513
I was able to block Mara
from reading my thoughts.

641
01:20:45,613 --> 01:20:48,992
- How?
- I suddenly thought of the ocean.

642
01:20:49,242 --> 01:20:51,936
I suddenly saw the view
in front of our house.

643
01:20:52,036 --> 01:20:55,315
You know how Barbara and I
used to dream our dreams there?

644
01:20:55,415 --> 01:20:57,401
We used to stand on the cliff and...

645
01:20:57,501 --> 01:21:01,447
right in front of us was something so
much more powerful than we'll ever be.

646
01:21:01,547 --> 01:21:05,660
That image came to me. That image came
to me, and they couldn't see past it.

647
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,890
I know I can do that again.
I can build a wall.

648
01:21:09,222 --> 01:21:12,008
I can build a wall and deceive them.

649
01:21:18,608 --> 01:21:20,729
What are you going to do?

650
01:21:22,653 --> 01:21:25,238
The only thing that we can do.

651
01:21:32,706 --> 01:21:34,080
No.

652
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:36,379
Not David!

653
01:21:36,544 --> 01:21:40,042
He's not one of them! No!

654
01:22:18,423 --> 01:22:20,492
Multiple suspects. Possible 417.

655
01:22:20,592 --> 01:22:23,758
All units respond and echo your 10-4.

656
01:22:24,179 --> 01:22:25,803
41-A.

657
01:22:27,141 --> 01:22:29,263
41-A, do you copy?

658
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:32,892
Echo, 41-A. Do you copy?

659
01:22:33,064 --> 01:22:35,216
We're in position. Send them in.

660
01:22:35,316 --> 01:22:38,732
Roger, this is 2-A. I copy.
241 in progress. Stand by.

661
01:22:57,091 --> 01:22:58,826
What are you waiting for?

662
01:22:58,926 --> 01:23:00,966
You got your orders.

663
01:23:35,007 --> 01:23:36,086
Get out!

664
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:34,207
- More death.
- Survival.

665
01:26:42,505 --> 01:26:45,588
Tell us what arrangements
you have made for us.

666
01:26:46,093 --> 01:26:48,298
Well, I haven't had much time.

667
01:26:50,764 --> 01:26:53,100
It is 11:22.

668
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:56,061
What are you anxious about?

669
01:26:57,647 --> 01:26:59,769
The arrangements.

670
01:27:00,442 --> 01:27:02,694
Yes. Actually, I...

671
01:27:02,861 --> 01:27:04,971
I left my notebook out in the car.

672
01:27:05,071 --> 01:27:07,141
I wonder if somebody
could go out and...

673
01:27:07,241 --> 01:27:10,656
get my notebook from
the front seat of my car.

674
01:27:14,123 --> 01:27:15,415
No.

675
01:27:26,429 --> 01:27:28,930
I am unable to see
what you're thinking.

676
01:27:29,641 --> 01:27:31,292
Well, I'm...

677
01:27:31,392 --> 01:27:35,130
just wondering who's going to go out
and get the notebook from my car.

678
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:37,021
- David.
- No.

679
01:27:58,172 --> 01:28:01,006
You are successfully
blocking your thoughts.

680
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:31,033
You are thinking...

681
01:28:31,917 --> 01:28:33,754
of a brick wall.

682
01:28:41,678 --> 01:28:43,965
Why do you keep looking at the clock?

683
01:28:57,112 --> 01:28:58,570
Come on.

684
01:28:59,031 --> 01:29:01,532
- We're going now.
- Mother, no.

685
01:29:15,006 --> 01:29:16,879
Take your place.

686
01:30:02,225 --> 01:30:04,679
Stop it! Leave her alone!

687
01:30:05,186 --> 01:30:06,589
Take him!

688
01:30:06,689 --> 01:30:08,645
Go now! Go!

689
01:32:03,441 --> 01:32:05,065
Don't worry.

690
01:32:06,487 --> 01:32:09,902
We'll go someplace where
nobody knows who we are.
