2
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,564
No.

3
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:41,457
Hey!

4
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:44,953
Where`s Howard and the rest
of the apprentices?

5
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,624
We left them at the bottom to find
their own way up!

6
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,792
They got to learn
sometime.

7
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:50,061
lf you want to be
a troubleshooter,

8
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:51,363
you got to know
the mine.

9
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:52,836
ls it all clear
down there?

10
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:54,770
Yeah, we won`t
need these anymore,

11
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,364
but l wouldn`t go
lighting any matches.

12
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,611
Damn methane.

13
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:03,546
lt`s going to blow
this place to shit one of these days.

14
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:05,312
We ain`t that lucky.

15
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:12,518
Whoo, hey, come on, now.
Knock it off.

16
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:24,204
Howard!

17
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,297
Hey, Howard!

18
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:28,569
Hey! Enjoy
your walk up?

19
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,577
Yeah, real joke.
Why didn`t you guys wait?

20
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,704
Look, Landers, you got
to get a lot of exercise

21
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,714
if you`re going to
grapple with Gretchen.

22
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:36,546
Oh, yeah? Well, l got
a Valentine for her

23
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:38,017
that she`s never
going to forget.

24
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:39,849
Right to the heart, huh?

25
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:42,287
lt`s going to be a hot time
on Saturday night!

26
00:04:42,357 --> 00:04:44,086
Yee-haw!

27
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,218
Hey, Stavinski, you do
anything else with that

28
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:47,887
except throw it
over your shoulder and burp it?

29
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:50,796
Aw, get lost, Axel.

30
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:53,836
Oh, bunch of clowns. Things haven`t
changed a bit. Same as always.

31
00:04:53,903 --> 00:04:55,962
Bet you wish
you never came back.

32
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:59,008
Especially now since Sarah`s
going out with Axel.

33
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:03,043
No skin off my nose.

34
00:05:03,112 --> 00:05:05,080
l don`t give a damn.

35
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:08,082
Come on, last one
into town gets the brew.

36
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:09,585
Let`s go.

37
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:10,745
Okay.

38
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:12,880
Let`s go, guys!
Whoo-ha!

39
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:31,398
Quitting time!
Casanova is here!

40
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:32,905
Yee-haw!

41
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:34,134
Gretchen, it`s me.

42
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:36,677
Howard,
stay away from me.

43
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:38,474
Hi, babe.

44
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:41,107
- How are you?
- l`m fine.

45
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:44,243
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

46
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,911
Hi, sweetie.

47
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:50,782
You big brute,
l missed you.

48
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,923
Anything l should know?

49
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,265
No.
Of course not.

50
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,032
Gretchen, l want you
to be my date for the dance. Will you?

51
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:04,505
Dry up.

52
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,633
Gretchen, you know
what would look really good on you?

53
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,735
- What?
- Me.

54
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:10,144
Suck it in and
zip it up, will you?

55
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:13,047
Gretchen,
why fight it?

56
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:14,482
Oof.

57
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:16,213
Let the good times
roll.

58
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:18,517
All right!

59
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:21,183
Hi, fellas.

60
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:23,658
Mabel, this is the best thing
that`s happened to this town in years.

61
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:26,128
Your decorating committee
has done one hell of a job.

62
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:27,392
Well, after all,

63
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:29,559
the first Valentine`s
dance in 20 years

64
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:31,625
has to be
something special.

65
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:33,603
Uh, yeah, well, uh,

66
00:07:33,672 --> 00:07:35,970
of course, you`re right,
Mabel, but l think we`d all be better off

67
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,702
if you played down
the fact

68
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:40,074
that it`s the first Valentine`s dance
in 20 years,

69
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:42,614
if you know
what l mean.

70
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:53,015
Let`s just concentrate
on having a good time Saturday night

71
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:55,890
and put all that
other business to rest.

72
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:57,486
My thoughts
exactly, Mayor.

73
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:04,662
Hi, guy.

74
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:07,434
Oh, come on,
you clowns!

75
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:10,705
Help Miss Osborne
pick those things up.

76
00:08:12,312 --> 00:08:15,008
What the hell are
you kids doing in here?

77
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:16,710
You`re supposed to be
decorating the room,

78
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:18,911
not each other.

79
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:22,389
Where you going,
son?

80
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:24,391
Where l always go
this time of day--

81
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:28,828
for another beer
and a real good nose pick.

82
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:30,762
Ooh!
l`m sorry, TJ.

83
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:37,333
l don`t think he likes
being back in the mine very much.

84
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:38,566
Well, that`s too bad.

85
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:40,438
Nobody told him to go out
to the West Coast.

86
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:43,069
lt`s not my fault
he couldn`t make it on his own.

87
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:44,703
But now that
he`s back here,

88
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,441
he`s my son and he`s
working in the mine.

89
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:52,654
You guys better put those things back
where you found them,

90
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:54,917
or l`ll turn you both upside down.
Especially you.

91
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:57,255
This is my date, Chief.

92
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:59,352
Chief, that meeting
in Centerville is at 7:00.

93
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:00,794
Maybe we should
hit the road.

94
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:04,356
Then let`s go.
l`ll see you kids later. Bye, Mabel.

95
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:06,664
- Keep up the good work.
- See you, Chief.

96
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:08,466
l might as well go too.

97
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,973
All of this will have
to be rewashed.

98
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:12,532
l`m really sorry, Mabel.

99
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:20,242
This is station QPlD,
940 on your radio dial...

100
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:21,842
Oh.

101
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,580
Mayor!

102
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,654
Mayor?

103
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:29,318
Mayor, somebody
left this for you.

104
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:32,124
For me?
Who was it?

105
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,165
l don`t know. lt was already inside
when we got here.

106
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:36,029
Maybe you got
a secret admirer, huh?

107
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:39,159
You in on this, Mabel?

108
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:41,262
l`m afraid not, Mayor.

109
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:44,236
Oh, no.

110
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,642
No no.
Don`t look at me.

111
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:48,578
l didn`t have a thing
to do with it.

112
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,380
Oh, well, hell,

113
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:52,679
l`ve been looking
for an excuse

114
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:55,949
to get off this miserable diet
Mrs. Hanniger has me on.

115
00:09:56,022 --> 00:09:57,114
Thanks, Howard.

116
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,318
lf there`s one thing
l like better

117
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:02,624
than Christmas candy,
it`s Valentine`s candy.

118
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:03,958
Have some.

119
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:05,794
Hey...

120
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,333
who sent it?

121
00:10:08,702 --> 00:10:10,932
``From the heart
comes a warning

122
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:12,973
filled with
bloody good cheer--

123
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,235
remember what happened

124
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,938
as the 14th draws near.``

125
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:24,479
lt can`t be
happening again.

126
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:27,578
lt can`t be happening
again.

127
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:59,487
lt`s a bad time,

128
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:01,956
this time of year.

129
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:04,186
Bad things coming.

130
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:06,058
My words, you hear.

131
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:09,797
Beware the 14th

132
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:12,631
- if you value your life.
- Here we go again.

133
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:15,138
How many times is he
going to tell this story?

134
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:18,175
Oh, let him tell it.
l love fairy tales.

135
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:21,234
This ain`t no fairy tale,
little girl.

136
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:23,577
lf you don`t
take it seriously,

137
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,014
you`re a fool.

138
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,449
Ohh!

139
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,577
Hurt yourself?

140
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,646
Axel, are you okay?

141
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,351
Oh, no.
Let me see.

142
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,530
l know what
l`m talking about.

143
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,229
l`m telling you now,

144
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,272
this town is a-cursed.

145
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:50,407
Now it started
20 years ago.

146
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,809
lt was the night
of the Valentine`s Day dance

147
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,813
at the Union Hall--

148
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,781
the biggest event of the year.

149
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,311
lt had been a tradition
for over 100 years.

150
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:05,017
Everybody was there,
except for seven miners

151
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,788
who were out
at the Henniger Mine,

152
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:11,195
five of them
still down below.

153
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:14,166
Two supervisors
were waiting for the men to come up.

154
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,500
Anxious to get
to the party,

155
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,563
they left before
the men were safely out

156
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:21,336
failing to check
the methane gas levels

157
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,206
in the tunnels
down below.

158
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:34,122
The five men
were buried alive

159
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,215
as the town
continued its party.

160
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:41,022
For six weeks,
we dug around the clock

161
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:43,088
to try to save them.

162
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,532
After we broke through,

163
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:48,092
one man was found alive.

164
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:51,875
l was the one
who found him.

165
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:01,575
Harry Warden spent the next year
in the state mental hospital.

166
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:03,882
Exactly one year later,

167
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:05,946
on Valentine`s Day,

168
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:08,515
he came back to town.

169
00:13:08,593 --> 00:13:10,026
He killed
the two supervisors

170
00:13:10,094 --> 00:13:12,494
who had left their posts
the year before.

171
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:16,290
Then he cut out
their hearts

172
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:20,269
and stuffed them into
heart-shaped candy boxes.

173
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:23,365
That night at the dance
we found the boxes,

174
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:25,410
blood dripping
out the sides.

175
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:28,671
lnside was a note--

176
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:30,772
a warning from Harry

177
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,978
never to hold
a Valentine`s dance

178
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:35,884
ever again.

179
00:13:37,156 --> 00:13:39,421
Every February 14,

180
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:42,154
Harry comes back to town,

181
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:44,925
his pickax
stained with blood,

182
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:48,695
waiting in the shadows
of the Henniger Mine...

183
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:52,237
just for someone
to kill

184
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:55,206
should they not heed
his warning.

185
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:56,709
lt could be you.

186
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:00,376
l know what l`m saying.

187
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:03,884
You forget about having a party
at all on Saturday night,

188
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:05,578
or you may not live
to see daylight.

189
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:11,590
Laugh now...

190
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,386
but you`ll be sorry
you didn`t listen to me.

191
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:17,796
Uh-oh.

192
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:20,892
Come on, Hap,
lighten up.

193
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:22,334
lt`s a stupid legend.

194
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,736
lt gives me
the creeps.

195
00:14:24,806 --> 00:14:26,740
Hi, you guys.
Who ordered the Moosehead?

196
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:30,335
l did, you gorgeous slab
of female fleshiness.

197
00:14:58,242 --> 00:15:00,733
l hate that song.

198
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:05,144
l mean,
it`s, like, uh--

199
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:06,581
hey, where you going?

200
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:08,915
l just want to put on
some music, okay?

201
00:15:08,987 --> 00:15:10,818
Be my guest.

202
00:15:12,857 --> 00:15:14,188
Excuse me.

203
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,449
Excuse me.

204
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:27,904
lt`s your own fault.
You know that, don`t you, TJ?

205
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:29,441
Never said it wasn`t.

206
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:34,869
Then why can`t you
just accept things the way they are?

207
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:38,509
Maybe because l don`t like
the way things are.

208
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,653
Excuse me.

209
00:15:57,372 --> 00:15:59,465
Yes, all right.

210
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,634
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

211
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,473
l have to call
in the morning.

212
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:07,446
The administration office
is closed at night.

213
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:09,540
The nurse that`s on duty
doesn`t know a thing.

214
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:13,054
Well, she`s got to know whether
he`s there or not.

215
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:14,987
l just hope this is
some kind of joke

216
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,548
and the kids are just trying to scare
the hell out of us.

217
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:21,255
lf it is a joke, l want every one of
those kids strung up,

218
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,060
starting with that damn
Howard Landers!

219
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,658
Well, it`s a human
heart, all right.

220
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,500
A young woman,
about 30 years old.

221
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,597
What the hell are you guys doing
with a loose heart?

222
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:33,835
Looks like a butcher
ripped this thing out.

223
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,710
What`s going on over
in Valentine Bluffs?

224
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:39,339
You remember
Harry Warden?

225
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:42,776
God, of course
l remember.

226
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:44,513
Those were
terrible murders.

227
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:47,984
God, l thought
they locked him up in Easftield

228
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,027
20 years ago.

229
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:51,618
They did.

230
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:54,255
Are you sure
he`s still there?

231
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:56,265
We`ll find out in the morning.
l`m checking on it.

232
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,891
Well, gentlemen,

233
00:16:57,968 --> 00:16:59,492
l`d say you have
your answer.

234
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,267
lt looks like Harry Warden`s
back in town.

235
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:53,348
Well, now,

236
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,188
l wonder who sent this?

237
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,420
Jake?

238
00:19:01,132 --> 00:19:02,360
Ohh.

239
00:19:05,837 --> 00:19:09,398
``Roses are red,
violets are blue...

240
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
one is dead,
and so are you``?

241
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,918
No!

242
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:23,353
No! Get away!
Get away!

243
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:24,856
Get away!

244
00:19:24,924 --> 00:19:26,391
No! No!

245
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:35,392
Get away!
No! No!

246
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:42,407
No! No!

247
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,784
Hey, this is getting
really good.

248
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:53,285
Don`t put
your nose in it.

249
00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:58,852
Hey, this is what
l really call junk food.

250
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:00,394
How much longer, Hollis?
l`m freezing.

251
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:02,327
Hey, relax.
This thing ain`t no microwave.

252
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:04,695
Hey, how about
revving it up?

253
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:06,461
Man, have l got
the munchies.

254
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:09,059
Yeah, me, too.
A little protein patrol, hey, boys?

255
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:11,106
Don`t go
poking my meat.

256
00:20:12,408 --> 00:20:13,875
lt`s hardly cooked.

257
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:16,703
Don`t go sticking
your nose in the food.

258
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:18,576
lt`s his. He can do what
he wants with it.

259
00:20:18,648 --> 00:20:21,014
ls that turkey, Hollis?
l asked for roast beef.

260
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,948
Turkey for the turkey.

261
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:55,417
Here.

262
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,258
Come on, shove over.

263
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,579
Sure is cold tonight.

264
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,138
Yeah.

265
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,962
Well, l guess we got
ourselves a problem, huh?

266
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,371
Yeah.

267
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:50,533
Yeah, l guess so.

268
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:53,876
What are we going
to do about it?

269
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:58,442
Well, there ain`t
nothing to do about it.

270
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:01,723
Sarah`s
going with me now

271
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,417
and that`s
all there is to it.

272
00:22:03,492 --> 00:22:06,757
l ain`t going to back off
for you, TJ.

273
00:22:06,828 --> 00:22:09,627
Nobody asked you
to go away, TJ.

274
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:11,724
Come on, Axel, don`t give me
any of that horseshit.

275
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:13,769
l mean, you`re beginning
to sound like my old man.

276
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:15,360
Too bad, man.

277
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:17,133
Look, you left.
You left.

278
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:18,969
You went away, and we didn`t know
where you were

279
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,032
or-- or when the hell
you were coming back.

280
00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:24,445
l ain`t going to back off
for you, TJ.

281
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:26,106
You stay the hell
away from Sarah.

282
00:22:26,182 --> 00:22:27,275
All right, all right.

283
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:29,911
You want a fight,
then you got it.

284
00:22:29,987 --> 00:22:32,512
Because you and l
both know who Sarah wants.

285
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,878
You were kind of
hard on him, Teege.

286
00:23:00,953 --> 00:23:03,148
You can`t exactly
blame him.

287
00:23:03,222 --> 00:23:06,419
Sure, it`s not his fault.
lt`s nobody`s fault.

288
00:23:06,492 --> 00:23:08,153
l don`t know
what to do.

289
00:23:08,227 --> 00:23:10,252
You know, l really do like
that son of a bitch.

290
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:13,493
Hey, remember--

291
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,625
remember how we used to tear
this place apart?

292
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:18,637
Eh? Get drunk,
race out to the bluffs?

293
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,195
That was great.

294
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:25,511
l guess
things change, huh?

295
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:28,904
Nothing stays the same.

296
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:40,527
W-A-R-D-E-N.

297
00:23:40,595 --> 00:23:43,655
Harry Warden.
He was committed under court order

298
00:23:43,731 --> 00:23:45,130
approximately
20 years ago.

299
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:47,190
Well, l`m afraid
l have no records

300
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:49,065
of a Harry Warden,
past or present.

301
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,935
But how can that be?
He was committed there

302
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:53,338
under court order.

303
00:23:53,408 --> 00:23:56,104
l`m sorry.
l have no records on him.

304
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:58,976
Look, in 20 years, any number of things
could have happened.

305
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:02,483
Now if this Harry Warden
was committed, as you say,

306
00:24:02,551 --> 00:24:04,212
then he`s simply
no longer here.

307
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:05,810
And if l have
no records on him,

308
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,949
l have to assume that he`s transferred,
he`s released,

309
00:24:09,025 --> 00:24:11,721
or he`s on the slab.
One of three, take your pick.

310
00:24:11,794 --> 00:24:14,262
One out of three?

311
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,798
Now look, Mrs. Raleigh, you`re
going to have to do

312
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:18,697
a little bit better
than that.

313
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:21,430
Now l have to know
what happened to this man

314
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,404
and l have to know
what happened to him now.

315
00:24:23,473 --> 00:24:25,202
Now have you
checked everything?

316
00:24:25,275 --> 00:24:26,436
Everything...

317
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,978
except the microfilms
over in central file,

318
00:24:29,046 --> 00:24:31,207
and it will take
several days to check that.

319
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:33,113
Look, l need answers
and l need them fast.

320
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:34,775
l`ll be waiting
for your call.

321
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:38,583
Dr. Peyton, 3-5-3.

322
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,487
Jumping J--

323
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:42,321
they don`t even know what the hell
happened to him.

324
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,225
Well, w-what
do we need to know?

325
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:46,264
lt`s got to be Harry.

326
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:50,027
Maybe we ought
to cancel the dance.

327
00:24:50,101 --> 00:24:52,968
Just decide which one
you really want.

328
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:54,300
And now for
the big moment--

329
00:24:54,372 --> 00:24:57,170
will it be number one,
or will it be number two?

330
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:58,641
Patty, will you
be serious?

331
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,508
This is important.

332
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,842
You can`t have them
both, you know.

333
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:04,109
- l don`t want them both.
- Oh, no?

334
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:05,309
No.

335
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,783
Just what l thought.

336
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:12,756
Oh, l don`t know.
TJ won`t talk to me.

337
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:15,055
He just sulks
all day long.

338
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:16,424
He ends up making me
feel guilty,

339
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:19,158
when he`s the one
who owes me the apology.

340
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:21,530
And Axel is not
behaving any better.

341
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:24,662
Oh, Patty, l don`t even want to go
to the dance on Saturday night.

342
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh, but you got to go.

343
00:25:26,073 --> 00:25:27,870
lt`ll be all right.
Just stay with Hollis and me.

344
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:29,841
Besides, you got to see
the dress l got--

345
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,242
cut down to here,
slit up to there.

346
00:25:32,312 --> 00:25:34,804
l may not get out alive.

347
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:57,500
Mabel?

348
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:04,142
Mabel, l got
to talk to you.

349
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:06,943
We got a problem
concerning the dance.

350
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:13,815
Mabel!

351
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,687
Mabel, you back here?

352
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

353
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:48,780
Okay.
Little John?

354
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:52,453
l want you and Mike
to check the wall.

355
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:53,790
TJ,

356
00:27:53,863 --> 00:27:55,455
take care of the sump.

357
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:59,227
You get a pump down there,
or l ain`t doing it.

358
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:01,599
You do it or you get
your ass out of here for good.

359
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,605
l`ll do it.

360
00:28:04,673 --> 00:28:06,140
l`ll do it.

361
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:09,507
What`s bugging
him today?

362
00:28:10,547 --> 00:28:11,809
Son of a bitch
is after my ass

363
00:28:11,882 --> 00:28:13,406
because of Sarah.

364
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,110
lf he keeps it up,
l`m going to nail him.

365
00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:17,278
l said move it,
Hanniger!

366
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:23,822
Oh, yeah.
Come on, man.

367
00:28:27,732 --> 00:28:30,257
Anytime, loser.

368
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,495
Hey, that`s it!
Break it up, you two!

369
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,664
TJ, you get your ass
up top to crew 17.

370
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,504
Go!

371
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:41,774
There ain`t going to be no fighting
in my section, Palmer!

372
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:43,144
Understand?

373
00:28:59,132 --> 00:29:01,100
What an awful smell.

374
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,999
This is like it was
20 years ago.

375
00:29:09,075 --> 00:29:12,977
l can remember those murders
just like it was yesterday.

376
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:15,038
Jake, you got to get
help from Granville.

377
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:16,844
No, not yet.

378
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:19,477
lf we call in Granville, we`ll have police
crawling all over this place

379
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:21,885
and we`ll have a hell
of a panic on our hands.

380
00:29:21,956 --> 00:29:24,322
You just mention
that Harry`s back

381
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:28,794
and this town won`t
be worth the powder to blow it to hell.

382
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:30,387
Uh, just a minute.
Just a minute, boys.

383
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:32,558
Uh...

384
00:29:32,634 --> 00:29:35,569
l want you to bring
the ambulance around back.

385
00:29:35,637 --> 00:29:37,730
Load her up from there.

386
00:29:37,806 --> 00:29:40,741
l don`t want anybody
in town seeing this.

387
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:42,470
You remember--

388
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:44,637
Mabel Osborne died
of a heart attack

389
00:29:44,713 --> 00:29:46,840
and that`s all.

390
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:48,348
You breathe one word
of this to anybody

391
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,386
and you`ll have
to answer to me.

392
00:29:53,122 --> 00:29:55,090
Wait a minute.
What`s this?

393
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:03,823
Take her away.

394
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:12,836
``lt happened once,

395
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,003
it happened twice.

396
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:18,974
Cancel the dance
or it`ll happen thrice.``

397
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:20,607
Oh, well,

398
00:30:20,684 --> 00:30:22,618
th-th-that`s it.

399
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:24,917
The dance is canceled.

400
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,651
Let`s tear every poster,
every banner,

401
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,922
every decoration down
and-- and out of sight.

402
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,055
l don`t want to see a single Valentine`s
heart anywhere.

403
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:37,363
As long as this town is
decorated to the hilt,

404
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,959
Harry`s going
to keep on killing.

405
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,235
And-- and get that damn
Union Hall locked up.

406
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:43,866
All right.
All right, Mayor.

407
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:47,106
No, l`m sorry.
There`s nothing l can do about it.

408
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,545
Hey, what`s going on?

409
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,082
The mayor has
canceled the dance

410
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,744
and that`s
all there is to it.

411
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:57,847
Well, in the light of Mabel`s death,
he had no choice.

412
00:30:57,924 --> 00:30:59,255
There`ll be
no parties, either.

413
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:01,191
We owe her
that much respect.

414
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:02,785
Mabel would`ve wanted us
to have the dance.

415
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,159
l mean, she worked
so hard on it.

416
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,720
Yeah, you can`t
cancel it now.

417
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:08,097
He`s just looking for an excuse to
cancel the dance.

418
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:10,329
That`s the way it is.

419
00:31:10,403 --> 00:31:12,769
They`ll be no dance
tomorrow night

420
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:15,741
and no parties, either.
Do you understand me?

421
00:31:20,614 --> 00:31:22,138
Hanniger!

422
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:25,482
You and me have
something to settle!

423
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:27,316
You bet we do.

424
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:34,492
Howard, you got
to chew it.

425
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:35,791
You don`t
blow bubbles with it.

426
00:31:35,864 --> 00:31:37,957
l`ll take care
of myself.

427
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:40,524
How`d you ever get
to be so stupid?

428
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:47,365
l`m going to shower.

429
00:31:56,452 --> 00:31:59,512
TJ, will you stop this?
l don`t want to go with you.

430
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:02,854
Are you
listening to me?

431
00:32:02,925 --> 00:32:04,119
Nope.

432
00:32:34,893 --> 00:32:36,360
Remember this spot?

433
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:41,722
Of course l remember
this spot.

434
00:33:01,054 --> 00:33:03,318
Why didn`t you
write me, TJ?

435
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,517
Why didn`t you call?

436
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:09,293
l wanted to, believe me,

437
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,624
but l couldn`t.

438
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:15,196
l mean, l really fell
on my ass out there.

439
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:17,567
l made so many mistakes.

440
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:20,004
But l learned something.

441
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,048
Look...

442
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,644
give me a chance.

443
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:35,189
lf you still want me
to go away, l will.

444
00:33:35,257 --> 00:33:38,158
But l have to tell you that l love you
and l want you back.

445
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:42,459
How was l supposed
to know that, Jessie?

446
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:46,695
l honestly didn`t think
you were ever coming back.

447
00:33:46,768 --> 00:33:48,737
You just left me here.

448
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:52,004
Sarah, please.

449
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:54,700
l`m sorry.

450
00:33:54,777 --> 00:33:56,802
l`m so damn sorry.

451
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,790
Have you seen Sarah?

452
00:34:42,895 --> 00:34:46,592
Ain`t my turn
to watch after her.

453
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:14,589
Damn it, Sarah,
why do you do this to yourself?

454
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:17,825
How am l going
to tell Axel?

455
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:32,536
Sarah!

456
00:35:35,985 --> 00:35:38,044
Chief Newby.

457
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,850
l`m sorry
l startled you.

458
00:35:40,923 --> 00:35:42,288
lt`s all right.

459
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,019
ls something the matter?

460
00:35:46,162 --> 00:35:47,390
No, l`m--

461
00:35:47,464 --> 00:35:50,763
l`m just making
my nightly patrol.

462
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:52,665
Right.

463
00:35:57,173 --> 00:35:58,731
Good night, Chief.

464
00:35:58,808 --> 00:36:00,799
Oh, good night,
Sarah.

465
00:36:04,815 --> 00:36:06,783
Give me a beer, Hap.

466
00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:11,421
You hear about
Mabel Osborne?

467
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:15,016
She got it just
the way l said.

468
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,787
Heart attack,
my ass.

469
00:36:18,996 --> 00:36:20,726
Well, if we aren`t going to have
a Valentine`s dance,

470
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:21,891
what are
we going to do?

471
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:24,162
Why don`t we have
a Valentine party?

472
00:36:24,236 --> 00:36:26,636
Yeah, a party!

473
00:36:26,705 --> 00:36:30,163
Where? Newby`s got this whole town
locked up, bright guy.

474
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:33,642
How about
my father`s mine, huh?

475
00:36:33,712 --> 00:36:36,613
- TJ, are you crazy? Come on.
- The mine!

476
00:36:38,351 --> 00:36:40,785
ln the mine?

477
00:36:40,853 --> 00:36:42,184
That`d be great.

478
00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:43,654
lt would.
What a blast.

479
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:45,452
ln the mine?
That`s exactly what it would be.

480
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:47,493
Oh, it`d be
great!

481
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,585
Come on, Hollis. We`ve got everything
we need down there.

482
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:51,721
We got, uh, let`s see,
we got a rec room.

483
00:36:51,798 --> 00:36:53,356
We got a pool table.
Everything.

484
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:57,131
Yeah, in the mine...
where people get killed and eaten.

485
00:36:57,204 --> 00:36:58,831
Beware of
Harry Warden.

486
00:36:58,906 --> 00:37:01,534
Whooo!

487
00:37:01,608 --> 00:37:03,667
Shut the fuck up.

488
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:06,110
Beware of what you make fun of,
you little asshole.

489
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,239
- Who?
- You.

490
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:11,149
Forget about having
a party at all tomorrow night

491
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:12,379
or you`ll be sorry.

492
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:16,018
Hey, lighten up, Hap.

493
00:37:16,091 --> 00:37:18,525
Piss on Harry Warden
and that damn old legend.

494
00:37:18,593 --> 00:37:21,187
We`re gonna have
ourselves a party.

495
00:37:21,262 --> 00:37:24,595
Don`t you
go telling nobody.

496
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:27,191
Don`t say
l didn`t warn you.

497
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:30,766
That settles it then.

498
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,071
We`re going to the mine
and we`re going to have ourselves a party.

499
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,515
Assholes.

500
00:38:40,814 --> 00:38:43,112
Damn kids.
l`ll show them.

501
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:45,344
Piss on Harry Warden,
will they?

502
00:38:45,418 --> 00:38:47,909
Well, l`ll give them
a scare they`ll never forget.

503
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,296
Ah.

504
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

505
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:33,589
Hey, it`s
party time.

506
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:40,967
Where are
the wieners?

507
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:45,176
Hey, Hollis,
here`s the wieners!

508
00:41:00,094 --> 00:41:02,562
Hi, Ben.
Anything happen?

509
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,325
No, it`s been quiet
all evening.

510
00:41:04,398 --> 00:41:06,161
Good.

511
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:08,565
That came for you
though.

512
00:41:11,506 --> 00:41:13,531
Oh my God.

513
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:21,982
Go and get me
a coffee, will you, Ben?

514
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,847
Yeah, sure, Chief.

515
00:42:00,558 --> 00:42:02,355
Mabel.

516
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:10,029
Yooo! Does anybody
want a beer?

517
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:12,592
Eat you up.
Mmm!

518
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:14,605
Whoo!

519
00:42:14,673 --> 00:42:16,538
Hollis,
check this out.

520
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:19,333
You asshole!

521
00:42:21,547 --> 00:42:23,014
Hey, who busted
the lock?

522
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,243
- l got the keys right here.
- Howard did.

523
00:42:25,317 --> 00:42:27,478
- Uh-oh.
- Howard.

524
00:42:27,553 --> 00:42:30,021
Harry Warden did it.

525
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,580
And whoever parked the red
Volkswagen out front,

526
00:42:32,658 --> 00:42:35,253
l want it parked out back
with the others like l said.

527
00:42:35,328 --> 00:42:37,694
l don`t want Newby
snooping around here.

528
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,732
Let me show you.

529
00:42:58,653 --> 00:43:01,281
- Hey, hold it.
- Whoa.

530
00:43:03,658 --> 00:43:04,818
Hey, John,
where you going?

531
00:43:04,892 --> 00:43:07,326
Sylvia`s gonna
get it tonight.

532
00:43:17,005 --> 00:43:19,565
Talk to you
in a minute, okay?

533
00:43:25,582 --> 00:43:27,573
So you`re looking
pretty good, baby face.

534
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:28,912
What`s the occasion?

535
00:43:28,985 --> 00:43:30,646
l figured it`ll get
Newby off my back.

536
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,883
Besides, l want to get out
of this town pretty quick.

537
00:43:33,957 --> 00:43:36,152
You know, l think
he really likes you.

538
00:43:40,463 --> 00:43:42,557
l`ve got the munchies.

539
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hot dogs.
Here, Spot.

540
00:44:06,024 --> 00:44:08,424
Hey, what`s going on?
Who is that?

541
00:44:39,726 --> 00:44:41,887
l, uh, l got a feeling
about the mine, Ben.

542
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:44,226
l`ll-- l`ll check back
with you, all right?

543
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:48,359
Make sure you call me on the radio
if anything comes up.

544
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,800
Will do.

545
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,767
Now what the hell
is that?

546
00:45:04,385 --> 00:45:05,943
Go on!

547
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,514
Go on!

548
00:45:12,962 --> 00:45:14,827
Go on, get the hell
out of here.

549
00:45:34,851 --> 00:45:36,648
``You didn`t stop
the party.``

550
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:41,917
Stop the party?

551
00:45:41,993 --> 00:45:44,018
What damn party?

552
00:46:02,781 --> 00:46:05,648
Stavinski, you couldn`t
clean that table with a broom.

553
00:46:05,717 --> 00:46:08,709
Hollis, you don`t even
know what pool means.

554
00:46:08,787 --> 00:46:10,277
Hey, guys, check this out.
Check this out.

555
00:46:10,355 --> 00:46:12,414
Gretchen,
this is for you.

556
00:46:15,595 --> 00:46:17,722
Oh, wow.

557
00:46:17,797 --> 00:46:20,197
First time l try to snort Coke, man,
and l almost drown.

558
00:46:20,266 --> 00:46:22,359
Next time,
try harder.

559
00:46:23,703 --> 00:46:26,035
- Axel, please.
- Oh, come on.

560
00:46:26,105 --> 00:46:28,733
- Axel, please don`t.
- What`s the matter, baby?

561
00:46:28,808 --> 00:46:31,436
- Axel, please don`t.
- Oh, come on!

562
00:46:31,511 --> 00:46:34,140
Will you please
stop it?

563
00:46:34,214 --> 00:46:37,411
Guess you better
back off there, Axel.

564
00:46:37,484 --> 00:46:39,543
Back the fuck off,
man.

565
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,783
We were doing just fine until you decided
to come crawling home.

566
00:46:42,856 --> 00:46:45,256
Well, in case you haven`t noticed,
things have changed around here.

567
00:46:45,326 --> 00:46:46,657
She don`t want nothing
to do with you.

568
00:46:46,727 --> 00:46:50,289
Do you mind?
l have my own mouth, thank you.

569
00:46:50,365 --> 00:46:52,993
Then why don`t you use it?
Tell him.

570
00:46:53,068 --> 00:46:55,002
Tell me what?

571
00:46:56,938 --> 00:46:59,133
She wants to come back
with me.

572
00:46:59,207 --> 00:47:00,435
Bullshit, man.

573
00:47:00,508 --> 00:47:03,841
Why don`t you
both just back off?

574
00:47:03,912 --> 00:47:05,880
You`re acting like
a couple of jerks.

575
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,445
Oh, well, you just
love it, don`t you?

576
00:47:12,888 --> 00:47:14,219
That`s it!

577
00:47:18,594 --> 00:47:21,154
You son of a bitch!

578
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:23,165
Hollis, do something.

579
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,268
Hollis!

580
00:47:27,304 --> 00:47:28,999
Let go.

581
00:47:29,072 --> 00:47:33,008
Shit!
Will you guys knock it off?

582
00:47:35,412 --> 00:47:36,879
TJ, are you
out of shape.

583
00:47:36,947 --> 00:47:38,915
Get out of here!

584
00:47:52,563 --> 00:47:54,588
Are you sure
you`re okay?

585
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:09,974
Look, l`m sorry.
l didn`t mean for that to happen.

586
00:48:16,489 --> 00:48:18,684
TJ, please stop it.

587
00:48:18,758 --> 00:48:22,285
l just don`t care
anymore.

588
00:48:22,362 --> 00:48:24,091
Just leave me alone.

589
00:48:32,206 --> 00:48:34,231
Okay, listen. l showed
you how to do it

590
00:48:34,308 --> 00:48:35,502
with the right nostril,
right?

591
00:48:35,576 --> 00:48:37,100
Now you take the straw
and you put it up the neck,

592
00:48:37,178 --> 00:48:39,169
the left nostril, right?
And you snort it.

593
00:48:41,982 --> 00:48:43,472
Come on, loosen up.
Let`s have fun.

594
00:48:43,551 --> 00:48:45,781
We`re at a Valentine`s party,
for God`s sake.

595
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:48,048
l got a little
punchy myself.

596
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,334
How do you
get those down?

597
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:43,175
- Pull the rope.
- Just pull it?

598
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:47,280
Yeah yeah.
Release the hook and let it go.

599
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:54,620
You know what we need?

600
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:57,355
Yeah, l got one
right here.

601
00:49:59,765 --> 00:50:01,426
No, l meant
a couple of beers.

602
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,627
Oh. l`ll go
get them.

603
00:50:03,702 --> 00:50:04,862
l`ll go with you.

604
00:50:04,937 --> 00:50:07,667
No, you stay here
and l`ll be back in a flash.

605
00:50:08,707 --> 00:50:10,538
Okay?

606
00:50:13,713 --> 00:50:15,578
Okay, but don`t take
too long.

607
00:50:15,649 --> 00:50:16,616
Back in a minute.

608
00:50:17,817 --> 00:50:19,409
Okay. Bye.

609
00:50:19,486 --> 00:50:21,010
Bye.

610
00:50:43,244 --> 00:50:44,734
Hey, TJ.

The same old shit.

614
00:50:57,993 --> 00:50:59,620
Well, Howard really
makes me gag.

615
00:50:59,695 --> 00:51:01,060
You`re not kidding.

616
00:51:01,129 --> 00:51:02,687
lf anyone, l kinda
like Tommy.

617
00:51:02,764 --> 00:51:05,131
Oh, l agree.

618
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:06,793
- Hi, John.
- Hi, girls.

619
00:51:09,038 --> 00:51:11,131
Yuck, what is this?

620
00:51:11,207 --> 00:51:14,643
Oh, wow. One of those idiots
really thinks he`s funny.

621
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,471
lt`s probably Howard.

622
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,459
John, is that you?

623
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,866
John?

624
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
John, if you`re trying to scare me,
you`re doing a good job.
John?

625
00:52:30,191 --> 00:52:31,624
Oh!

626
00:52:38,299 --> 00:52:40,597

627
00:52:42,904 --> 00:52:44,997
Help! Help!

628
00:52:45,073 --> 00:52:47,440

Hey, all right.

00:53:58,451 --> 00:54:00,885
And l`m coming in.

637
00:54:02,955 --> 00:54:04,513
Sylvia.

638
00:54:37,926 --> 00:54:40,724
Come in, Mobile One.

00:54:40,795 --> 00:54:42,729
Mobile One, in.

640
00:54:42,797 --> 00:54:45,288
Jake, you just
got a call from Easftield.

641
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:48,359
A woman named Raleigh.
She said it was urgent.

642
00:54:48,437 --> 00:54:52,430
All right.
Mobile One, coming in.

643
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:03,519
Hey, how about
a little trip down to the mine?

644
00:55:03,587 --> 00:55:05,179
- The mine?
- Yeah, it`ll be great. Come on.

645
00:55:05,255 --> 00:55:06,916
lt`s supposed to be
like a roller coaster, isn`t it?

646
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,651
lt`s 2,000 feet down.

647
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:11,250
That`s okay. lt`ll cheer her up anyway.
Come on, Hollis.

648
00:55:11,328 --> 00:55:13,228
Come on, Mike,

649
00:55:13,296 --> 00:55:15,161

00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:19,532
Come on.
Come on, Hollis.

652
00:55:19,604 --> 00:55:21,128
- Chicken.
- Chicken?

653
00:55:21,205 --> 00:55:22,866
Hey, why don`t we
go down to the mine?

654
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,670
All right. One quick ride down
and then right back up.

655
00:55:25,743 --> 00:55:28,576
- Hey, what about gear?
- Yeah, get that six-pack.

656
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:32,814

Ow!

Watch your step.
Come on.

659
00:55:42,094 --> 00:55:44,358
- This is ridiculous.
- This is gonna be great.

660
00:55:50,702 --> 00:55:51,862
Hollis!

661
00:55:51,937 --> 00:55:53,336
Where do you think
you`re going?

662
00:55:53,406 --> 00:55:54,839
We`re just going
to go for a quick ride

663
00:55:54,908 --> 00:55:56,068
and come right back up.
Believe me.

664
00:55:56,142 --> 00:55:57,200
You can`t take them
down there.

665
00:55:57,277 --> 00:56:00,508
You know the rule.
No women in the mine.

666
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,548
We`re gonna come right back up again.
Believe me.

667
00:56:02,615 --> 00:56:03,809
- Come on.
- Watch your step.

668
00:56:11,025 --> 00:56:13,084
Howard, don`t be a pain
in the ass.

669
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,718
Pain in the ass?
What pain in the ass?

670
00:56:14,795 --> 00:56:17,559
Be careful.
Be careful.

671
00:56:17,631 --> 00:56:19,724
Down we go.

672
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,798
Come on, you guys, hop in the cars.
l`ll be right back.

673
00:56:25,873 --> 00:56:28,342
- Yeah, we made it.
- You just let me know.

674
00:56:39,554 --> 00:56:40,851
Here, Sarah,

675
00:56:40,922 --> 00:56:42,184

00:56:42,257 --> 00:56:44,624
Here you go.
And a blanket.

00:56:44,694 --> 00:56:46,423
Hey, Hollis,

678
00:56:46,495 --> 00:56:48,793
Here`s one for you.
l`ll be right back.

679
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,458
Do you believe we`re
really doing this?

680
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:57,305
lt`s so dark
down there.

681
00:56:57,373 --> 00:57:00,274
On second thought,
l think l`m gonna stay right up here.

682
00:57:00,343 --> 00:57:02,369
Oh, no, you don`t.
lf l`m going down there, baby,

683
00:57:02,446 --> 00:57:04,505
- you`re going with me.
- Oh, great.

684
00:57:04,581 --> 00:57:07,311
Hey, hold on, everybody.
Here we go.

685
00:57:07,384 --> 00:57:09,375
Keep your hands inside.

686
00:57:09,453 --> 00:57:11,148
And pass me that beer.

687
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:13,086
All right.

688
00:57:13,156 --> 00:57:14,919
Come on, pass a couple
up this way.

689
00:57:14,992 --> 00:57:17,483
- Where`s the lantern?
- Right here. You just stick with me.

690
00:57:21,699 --> 00:57:23,428
Whoo-hoo!

691
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:25,969
Down she goes.

692
00:57:31,909 --> 00:57:34,275
Hold on.
Get ready to stop.

693
00:57:42,154 --> 00:57:45,146
Hey, Hollis, pass me a beer.
Want one, Mike?

694
00:57:45,224 --> 00:57:47,283
How far down
does it go?

695
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:49,384
300 miles deep.

696
00:57:49,461 --> 00:57:51,929
- Come on, Sarah.
- Here you go.

697
00:57:55,702 --> 00:57:57,795
You`re down here
every night?

698
00:57:57,871 --> 00:57:59,304
Wow.

699
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:16,182
Oh, little bit of a free ride.
There we go.

700
00:58:16,257 --> 00:58:18,782
Stops all by itself.

701
00:58:18,859 --> 00:58:21,987
Yeah, l hope you kids enjoyed yourself,
`cause we`re going right back up.

702
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:23,428
Oh, that was great, Hollis.

703
00:58:23,497 --> 00:58:25,226
- Let`s do it again.
- Howard usually walks.

704
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:28,696
Oh, let`s do it again, Hollis.
Come on.

705
00:58:30,072 --> 00:58:31,869
Hey, where does that go?

706
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,464
Oh, that leads to
an abandoned part.

707
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:35,066
We don`t go down
there anymore.

708
00:58:35,143 --> 00:58:37,543
- Oh, take us on a tour, Hollis.
- Yeah.

709
00:58:37,612 --> 00:58:39,136
Yeah, let`s show
them around.

710
00:58:39,214 --> 00:58:40,511
All right.
All right.

711
00:58:40,582 --> 00:58:42,140
Just because we`re here.
Come on.

712
00:58:42,217 --> 00:58:43,845
Keep those blankets
wrapped around you.

713
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,387
- You`re gonna get chilly.
- Okay, honey.

714
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:48,216
lt`s cold.

715
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:51,422
All right, boys and girls,
this is called a tipple.

716
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:54,258
So that`s a tipple.

717
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,662
This is also called
a tipple.

718
00:58:59,268 --> 00:59:01,430
- Hey, Howard, come on!
- Coming!

719
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:03,439
- Hey, Howard, come on!
- l`m coming!

720
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:05,941
l just heard something.
Probably some rats.

721
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:08,944
Rats! You never told me
there were rats.

722
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,276
This is the old engine room.

723
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:12,906
Oh, uh-huh.

724
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:14,450
Boy, what a nice view
back here.

725
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:16,782
Howard.

726
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:23,687
Hey, Hollis.

727
00:59:23,762 --> 00:59:26,230
We`ll meet you in 10 minutes
over at the main shaft.

728
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:29,357
All right. No longer.
We`re going straight up.

729
00:59:44,884 --> 00:59:46,647
lt`s pretty dark.

730
00:59:50,556 --> 00:59:51,524
How do you like
my pad, huh?

731
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:53,252
lt`s okay.

732
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:02,328
l can`t believe
you work here.

733
01:00:02,402 --> 01:00:04,427
Yep.

734
01:00:23,157 --> 01:00:24,818
- He`s in there!
- What is it?

735
01:00:24,892 --> 01:00:26,417
What`s the matter?

736
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,895
He`s in there.
He`s in there.

737
01:00:30,632 --> 01:00:32,827
What`s going on?
What`s going on?

738
01:00:39,007 --> 01:00:41,271
Dead.
He-- he--

739
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,039
- What are you talking about?
- He killed her.

740
01:00:43,112 --> 01:00:45,945
What are you
talking about?

741
01:00:46,015 --> 01:00:47,312
Dave is dead!

742
01:00:47,383 --> 01:00:50,250
No!
No!

743
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,220
No!

744
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:56,158
TJ, it`s Sylvia.
Somebody`s killed her.

745
01:00:56,226 --> 01:00:57,887
lt`s Harry Warden.
He`s here!

746
01:00:57,961 --> 01:00:59,623
Everybody get
the fuck out!

747
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:02,962
Go! Go! Go!

748
01:01:08,672 --> 01:01:10,867
Come on, come on!

749
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:13,535
Son of a bitch must have cut
the phone lines.

750
01:01:14,645 --> 01:01:16,272
Okay, now listen.
l want you to make sure

751
01:01:16,347 --> 01:01:17,781
that everybody
gets out of here.

752
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:19,111
And l want you
to get the chief

753
01:01:19,184 --> 01:01:21,277
and tell him to get
here and fast.

754
01:01:21,353 --> 01:01:22,650
Now go!

755
01:01:25,991 --> 01:01:28,516
Sarah, she`s in the mine
with the others.

756
01:01:28,593 --> 01:01:29,855
What?

757
01:01:29,928 --> 01:01:31,919
Her, Hollis
and Patty.

758
01:01:31,997 --> 01:01:33,488
They took the railcars
down there.

759
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:36,126
They`re in the mine right now.
We gotta get them out.

760
01:01:36,202 --> 01:01:38,762
That`s where that crazy guy probably is.
Look, he`ll kill them!

761
01:01:39,805 --> 01:01:41,204
l`m gonna get her out.

762
01:01:41,274 --> 01:01:43,970
Come on.
Come on!

763
01:01:52,586 --> 01:01:54,816
Go! Go!

764
01:01:54,888 --> 01:01:57,152
Come on.

765
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:05,125
lf anything happens
to Sarah, it`ll be your fault.

766
01:02:05,198 --> 01:02:07,063
You never should have
let them go down there.

767
01:02:07,134 --> 01:02:08,932
Damn it, let`s just worry about
getting them out.

768
01:02:09,003 --> 01:02:10,095
l`ll take
the abandoned section,

769
01:02:10,171 --> 01:02:11,331
you take
the level above.

770
01:02:11,406 --> 01:02:13,237
We`ll meet in the main shaft
by the elevator.

771
01:02:13,308 --> 01:02:16,641
Hope to God
we get there before Harry does.

772
01:02:16,711 --> 01:02:18,611
Good luck.

773
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Where is he?
l don`t know.
Boo!

774
01:02:49,346 --> 01:02:51,837
Gotcha.

775
01:02:51,915 --> 01:02:54,440
Damn you, Hollis.
Where the hell were you?

776
01:02:54,517 --> 01:02:55,950
l thought you were
right behind me.

777
01:02:56,019 --> 01:02:57,418
You must have gone down
the wrong tunnel.

778
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:59,888
Oh, sure we did.
You did that on purpose.

779
01:02:59,957 --> 01:03:03,017
Me? Come on.

780
01:03:04,195 --> 01:03:06,060
Okay.

781
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:07,358
Watch your head.

782
01:03:07,431 --> 01:03:08,625
Watch your step
as well.

783
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:18,372
This is the oldest
part of the mine.

784
01:03:18,443 --> 01:03:19,876
Oh, God!

785
01:03:19,945 --> 01:03:22,004
These tunnels were
built in the early 1800s.

786
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Really?
- Yeah, it`s all abandoned now.
Ooh.
We haven`t worked
down here in years. Not since...
Harry Warden.

787
01:03:33,493 --> 01:03:35,825
Howard, what do you
think you`re trying to do, you jerk?

788
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:38,557
Easy, l`ve got
a hangover.

789
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:40,223
Boy, did you guys
jump!

790
01:03:40,299 --> 01:03:41,994
Howard!

791
01:03:43,302 --> 01:03:45,668
Oh, Howard,
you goof.

792
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,968
- Get down out of there.
- l`ll go the other way.

793
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:50,533
- For Pete`s sake.
- l know what l`m doing.

794
01:03:52,346 --> 01:03:55,247
Oh, God, you guys.

795
01:03:55,315 --> 01:03:56,782
Come on.
Hold it.

796
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:59,819
Oh, that feels so good.

797
01:03:59,887 --> 01:04:01,354
- Okay.
- Okay.

798
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:04,084
- Get your light.
- All right. Okay.

799
01:04:04,158 --> 01:04:05,455
- Okay?
- Yeah.

800
01:04:05,526 --> 01:04:07,495
- You all right?
- Come on.

801
01:04:07,562 --> 01:04:08,961
Get down!

802
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:11,089
Now stick with us and
quit clowning around.

803
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:12,724
Come on! l was just having
a little bit of fun.

804
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:14,063
Yeah yeah, sure.

805
01:04:14,135 --> 01:04:16,501
Hey, you guys, where`s
Mike and Harriet?

806
01:04:16,571 --> 01:04:17,731
Maybe Harry Warden
got them.

807
01:04:17,806 --> 01:04:19,330
Stop it.

808
01:04:19,407 --> 01:04:21,170
Howard, come along
and behave yourself.

809
01:04:21,242 --> 01:04:23,005
Yeah, let`s go.

810
01:04:24,613 --> 01:04:25,602
My blanket!

811
01:04:25,681 --> 01:04:27,410
Oh, come on, you`d forget
your head

812
01:04:27,483 --> 01:04:29,348
if it wasn`t tied on with rope.
Let`s go.

813
01:04:29,418 --> 01:04:30,544
Come on, it`s freezing
down here.

814
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:32,086
Hey, who`s leading
this tour?

815
01:04:32,154 --> 01:04:33,951
Well, go ahead if you want.

816
01:04:42,299 --> 01:04:44,028
l feel so good.

817
01:04:44,101 --> 01:04:46,433
So do l.

818
01:04:55,545 --> 01:04:56,842
Where are we
going now, Hollis?

819
01:04:56,913 --> 01:04:59,849
Oh, this leads to the main shaft.
We`re going up.

820
01:04:59,917 --> 01:05:02,818
How come the walls
are so white around here, Hollis?

821
01:05:02,887 --> 01:05:04,855
l told you.
lt`s lime powder.

822
01:05:04,922 --> 01:05:06,856
They put it here
to contain explosions

823
01:05:06,924 --> 01:05:09,358
and they put it on the wood
so it doesn`t get dry and crack.

824
01:05:09,427 --> 01:05:11,019
Hey, you guys,

825
01:05:11,095 --> 01:05:13,461
how come Mike and Harriet
haven`t come back yet?

826
01:05:13,531 --> 01:05:15,625
Uh-oh.

827
01:05:16,969 --> 01:05:18,800
What`s that?

828
01:05:29,648 --> 01:05:31,583
l thought
l heard something.

829
01:05:31,651 --> 01:05:34,620
Look, it`s probably
only rats.

830
01:05:34,687 --> 01:05:37,087
That ain`t no rat.

831
01:05:37,157 --> 01:05:39,182
Come on, let`s go
find Mike and Harriet

832
01:05:39,259 --> 01:05:42,387
and get out of here.

833
01:05:42,462 --> 01:05:43,554
- Come on!
- Coming.

834
01:06:05,987 --> 01:06:08,421
Tommy Whitcomb, what the hell`s
the matter with you, anyway?

835
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:10,253
Where`s your brains?
How many times have l told you--

836
01:06:10,325 --> 01:06:13,260
Chief, listen to me.
You have to go to the mine.

837
01:06:13,328 --> 01:06:16,422
We were having a party and Harry Warden
started killing everybody!

838
01:06:16,498 --> 01:06:18,898
Harry Warden?

839
01:06:18,967 --> 01:06:20,366
Harry Warden
is at the mine.

840
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:22,266
There`s a bunch of kids
trapped down below.

841
01:06:22,337 --> 01:06:24,431
Axel and TJ are
trying to get them out.

842
01:06:24,507 --> 01:06:26,441
He killed Sylvia and Dave!

843
01:06:26,509 --> 01:06:29,501
All right. Get back in that car
and get home and stay put.

844
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:31,638
Go on!

845
01:06:41,692 --> 01:06:43,660
- Mobile One in.
- Go ahead, Chief.

846
01:06:43,727 --> 01:06:45,456
Yeah, Ben, call
the mayor right away,

847
01:06:45,529 --> 01:06:47,463
then round up
every available man.

848
01:06:47,531 --> 01:06:49,795
Meet me back at the mine.

849
01:06:49,866 --> 01:06:52,460
l think there`s some kids
trapped down below.

850
01:06:52,536 --> 01:06:53,935
Out.

851
01:06:55,606 --> 01:06:56,801
Howard, would you
get up in front?

852
01:06:56,874 --> 01:06:58,808
l`m trying to get
up in front!

853
01:06:58,876 --> 01:07:01,310
- Ow!
- l can`t even see.

854
01:07:01,379 --> 01:07:03,347
- Watch your head.
- Just stay beside me.

855
01:07:03,414 --> 01:07:06,315
- Okay.
- Michael!

856
01:07:06,384 --> 01:07:07,681
Mike!

857
01:07:07,752 --> 01:07:09,310
Why don`t
they answer us?

858
01:07:09,387 --> 01:07:11,548
- Stavinski!
- Mike!

859
01:07:11,623 --> 01:07:13,819
We never should
have left them in the first place.

860
01:07:13,892 --> 01:07:15,325
Maybe they`re
down there.

861
01:07:15,394 --> 01:07:16,827
- Jesus!
- TJ.

862
01:07:16,895 --> 01:07:18,829
What the hell
are you trying to do?

863
01:07:18,897 --> 01:07:20,057
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

864
01:07:20,132 --> 01:07:23,124
Yeah, we`re fine.
What`s the matter with you?

865
01:07:23,202 --> 01:07:24,499
We gotta get the hell
out of here.

866
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:26,435
Harry Warden is back.

867
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:28,666
He`s killed Sylvia
and Dave up top.

868
01:07:28,741 --> 01:07:31,006
Are you kidding?

869
01:07:31,077 --> 01:07:33,443
Harry`s dead.
Harry died a long time ago.

870
01:07:33,513 --> 01:07:36,277
Will you shut up and listen to me,
goddamn it!

871
01:07:36,349 --> 01:07:38,783
Now they`re dead and
he`s down here somewhere.

872
01:07:38,852 --> 01:07:40,285
lf you wanna get out
of here alive,

873
01:07:40,353 --> 01:07:42,321
you do exactly
as l tell you.

874
01:07:42,389 --> 01:07:44,721
What are we
gonna do?

875
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:47,419
This better not be
your idea of a joke, TJ.

876
01:07:47,494 --> 01:07:50,430
Do l look
like l`m joking?

877
01:07:50,498 --> 01:07:51,863
Come on.
Let`s go.

878
01:07:51,932 --> 01:07:54,594
Wait a minute.
Now what about Mike and Harriet?

879
01:07:54,669 --> 01:07:56,762
Last time l saw them,
they were in the engine room.

880
01:07:56,837 --> 01:07:58,429
You check the main shaft.

881
01:07:58,506 --> 01:08:00,940
l`ll take tunnel six
and meet you there.

882
01:08:01,008 --> 01:08:03,875
Howard, you stay with the girls
and wait for Axel.

883
01:08:03,944 --> 01:08:05,936
- Me?
- Stay with Howard.

884
01:08:06,014 --> 01:08:07,641
- No, Hollis, please!
- Stay back!

885
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:10,014
Hollis!
Wait a minute!

886
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,948
Howard,
you watch the girls!

887
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:18,284
l don`t even know
my way around.

888
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,453
Oh, shit.

889
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,829
Michael?

890
01:08:24,901 --> 01:08:26,459
Harriet?

891
01:08:26,536 --> 01:08:29,869
Michael and Harriet,
this isn`t anytime to be doing anything.

892
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

893
01:10:19,688 --> 01:10:22,351
Oh! Oh, Jesus!

894
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,421
No.

895
01:10:28,031 --> 01:10:30,625
Oh, God, Hollis!

896
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:35,871
Oh, Hollis!

897
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:40,437
Oh, God, Hollis.

898
01:10:40,511 --> 01:10:42,570
Oh.

899
01:10:42,646 --> 01:10:44,671
Oh, it`s not--

900
01:10:44,748 --> 01:10:47,478
Oh, please, God.

901
01:10:56,428 --> 01:10:58,487
Come on.
He`s dead.

902
01:10:58,563 --> 01:11:00,724
He`s dead!
Come on!

903
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:02,892
- Come on!
- Patty, come on.

904
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:05,266
Come on, he`s dead.
Now come on.

905
01:11:06,838 --> 01:11:08,499
- Patty!
- No.

906
01:11:08,573 --> 01:11:10,666
Howard, you bastard!

907
01:11:10,742 --> 01:11:12,108
He`s dead.
Now come on.

908
01:11:12,178 --> 01:11:14,373
You can`t leave us
like this!

909
01:11:17,049 --> 01:11:20,075
Patty, please.
Help me.

910
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:21,346
No!

911
01:11:22,455 --> 01:11:24,184
Leave him alone.

912
01:11:24,257 --> 01:11:25,656
- Let go of me.
- No.

913
01:11:25,725 --> 01:11:28,421
Patty, we need
the light, damn it!

914
01:11:35,769 --> 01:11:39,398
Okay, come on, Patty.
Don`t do this to me.

915
01:11:39,473 --> 01:11:41,907
We have to
get out of here.

916
01:11:41,975 --> 01:11:43,408
No!

917
01:11:43,477 --> 01:11:44,603
Stop it!

918
01:11:49,984 --> 01:11:52,509
Okay okay, come on.

919
01:11:56,491 --> 01:11:58,425
Oh, my God.

920
01:11:58,493 --> 01:11:59,926
Where are the others?

921
01:11:59,994 --> 01:12:03,123
We saw him.
He was standing right there.

922
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:05,428
Harry Warden`s
down here.

923
01:12:05,501 --> 01:12:06,934
Come on, let`s go.

924
01:12:07,002 --> 01:12:09,095
- Come on.
- No!

925
01:12:09,171 --> 01:12:10,433
Let`s go!
Come on!

926
01:12:10,506 --> 01:12:12,440
Where the hell is TJ?

927
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:14,942
He went looking
for Mike and Harriet.

928
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:17,035
He told us to stay here.

929
01:12:20,016 --> 01:12:22,211
Now come on.
The cage is right up ahead.

930
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:23,217
Let`s go!

931
01:12:24,287 --> 01:12:25,720
Keep moving.
You`re gonna be fine.

932
01:12:25,789 --> 01:12:27,950
- Axel, please! No!
- Hold on.

933
01:12:28,024 --> 01:12:30,857
Oh, let go of me.

934
01:12:30,927 --> 01:12:33,452
l don`t want to
leave him there.

935
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:35,623
- Shh. Shh.
- Let`s go back and get him.

936
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:37,634
l don`t want to--

937
01:12:37,702 --> 01:12:39,966
oh, please,
Axel, no.

938
01:12:40,037 --> 01:12:41,595
Patty, stop it!

939
01:12:41,672 --> 01:12:43,469
l don`t want to
leave him there.

940
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:46,476
You`ll be fine.
You`re gonna be just fine.

941
01:12:46,544 --> 01:12:48,978
Oh, God, where
are you taking us?

942
01:12:49,046 --> 01:12:51,742
Keep moving. We`re almost there.
We`re almost there.

943
01:12:51,816 --> 01:12:54,513
Keep moving. You`re doing fine.
You`re doing fine.

944
01:12:54,586 --> 01:12:55,575
That`s it.

945
01:12:57,055 --> 01:12:59,387
God, where are
we going?

946
01:13:01,059 --> 01:13:02,993
l can`t make it anymore.

947
01:13:03,061 --> 01:13:04,995
Shut up.
Yes, you can.

948
01:13:05,063 --> 01:13:06,291
Come on.
Let`s go.

949
01:13:06,365 --> 01:13:08,833
- l can`t!
- Let`s go.

950
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,035
Shit.

951
01:13:33,594 --> 01:13:35,585
lt`s TJ.

952
01:13:37,431 --> 01:13:39,058
Aw, shit!

953
01:13:39,133 --> 01:13:41,533
What the fuck
do you think you`re doing?

954
01:13:41,602 --> 01:13:43,035
l`m sorry, man.
l thought you were Harry.

955
01:13:43,103 --> 01:13:45,538
Do l look like Harry?
Where`s Howard?

956
01:13:45,607 --> 01:13:48,201
- He ran off.
- Oh, that jerk!

957
01:13:48,276 --> 01:13:50,210
He`s never gonna
find his way out of here alone.

958
01:13:50,278 --> 01:13:51,540
Hollis is dead.

959
01:13:51,613 --> 01:13:55,049
Look, we gotta get Sarah
and Patty up top,

960
01:13:55,116 --> 01:13:58,085

back for the others.

961
01:13:59,854 --> 01:14:01,549
- Come on.
- Okay, let`s go.

962
01:14:01,623 --> 01:14:04,149
Come on. Come on.
Let`s get going.

963
01:14:04,226 --> 01:14:05,523
Okay.

964
01:14:54,179 --> 01:14:56,773
Mobile One, come in.

965
01:14:56,849 --> 01:14:59,682
Mobile One.

966
01:14:59,752 --> 01:15:01,310
Come in, Mobile One.

967
01:15:07,025 --> 01:15:08,458
Watch your step.

968
01:15:08,527 --> 01:15:10,962
Okay.
l can`t even see.

969
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:12,463
We`re almost there.

970
01:15:12,532 --> 01:15:14,124
Shh! Keep your
voices down.

971
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,134
- Come on.
- Shh!

972
01:15:16,202 --> 01:15:17,134
Please, hurry.

973
01:15:17,203 --> 01:15:19,068
Shh! Keep your
voices down.

974
01:15:40,227 --> 01:15:42,092
He smashed
the control panel.

975
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,029
There`s no way we`re
getting out of here.

976
01:15:44,099 --> 01:15:46,033
What?

977
01:15:46,101 --> 01:15:48,001
What are we gonna do?

978
01:15:50,572 --> 01:15:52,437
Climb.

979
01:15:52,507 --> 01:15:54,168
- Come on.
- No.

980
01:15:54,242 --> 01:15:55,470
Come on.

981
01:16:07,924 --> 01:16:10,893
Watch your footing now.

982
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,020
Axel, please slow down.

983
01:16:14,096 --> 01:16:15,825
Patty, you`re okay.
l`m right behind you.

984
01:16:15,898 --> 01:16:17,422
Keep going.

985
01:16:25,042 --> 01:16:26,441
Come on. Come on.
Don`t look down.

986
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:28,000
Keep looking up.

987
01:16:28,078 --> 01:16:30,308
Patty, just do as he says,
and you`ll be fine.

988
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:31,904
l promise.

989
01:16:37,021 --> 01:16:40,388
l don`t want to
go any further.

990
01:16:40,458 --> 01:16:43,450
Please, can we stop
and go another way?

991
01:16:43,528 --> 01:16:46,759
There`s no other way.
Now move it, damn it!

992
01:16:58,110 --> 01:16:59,907
Axel, you`ll
have to go slower.

993
01:16:59,979 --> 01:17:02,914
l`m right behind her.
She keeps stopping.

994
01:17:02,982 --> 01:17:04,609
Go slower, okay?

995
01:17:14,895 --> 01:17:17,386
Oh!

996
01:17:17,464 --> 01:17:19,261
l`m scared of heights,
you guys.

997
01:17:19,332 --> 01:17:20,924
l`m not going
any further.

998
01:17:21,001 --> 01:17:22,798
l`m stopping right here.

999
01:17:22,869 --> 01:17:24,564
Sarah, Sarah.
Give her a hand.

1000
01:17:27,108 --> 01:17:29,303
Now l`m behind you.

1001
01:17:29,377 --> 01:17:31,811

Come on.

1002
01:17:31,879 --> 01:17:34,313
Okay.
Okay. Stay close.

1003
01:17:34,382 --> 01:17:36,782
Okay,

1004
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Attagirl.

Good girl.

1005
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:56,466
Come down.
Come down, quick. Down.

1006
01:18:18,896 --> 01:18:20,056
Don`t look.

1007
01:18:21,565 --> 01:18:24,193
Don`t look at him.
Come on.

1008
01:18:25,736 --> 01:18:28,170
Patty, over here.

1009
01:18:30,908 --> 01:18:33,376
Now he`s up top.

1010
01:18:33,444 --> 01:18:36,209
That bastard`s really
playing games with us.

1011
01:18:36,281 --> 01:18:39,148
We can beat him
if we can get to the rail cars.

1012
01:18:39,217 --> 01:18:41,276
Then, come on.
l know a shortcut through the sump.

1013
01:18:41,353 --> 01:18:42,479
lt`s over there.

1014
01:18:45,357 --> 01:18:46,824
Watch your step.

1015
01:18:57,203 --> 01:18:58,602
Come on.

1016
01:18:58,671 --> 01:19:00,605
Come on. Come on.
Nice and slow.

1017
01:19:00,673 --> 01:19:03,164
Let`s go. Let`s go.
Slowly.

1018
01:19:03,242 --> 01:19:05,472
TJ, take the girls over

1019
01:19:05,544 --> 01:19:07,478
and give me a yell
when you`re across.

1020
01:19:07,546 --> 01:19:09,811
Okay.

1021
01:19:09,883 --> 01:19:11,282
Go.

1022
01:19:11,351 --> 01:19:13,319
Watch your head.

1023
01:19:13,387 --> 01:19:14,877
Watch your step.

1024
01:19:28,536 --> 01:19:29,969
Okay.

1025
01:19:32,573 --> 01:19:35,508
Okay, Axel, we`re clear.
Come on over.

1026
01:19:38,413 --> 01:19:39,641
Axel?

1027
01:19:40,782 --> 01:19:41,943
Axel!

1028
01:19:50,059 --> 01:19:52,027
TJ, do something.

1029
01:19:52,094 --> 01:19:54,858
There`s nothing
l can do.

1030
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:56,955
lt`s 60-feet deep.

1031
01:19:57,032 --> 01:19:59,228
Gosh!

1032
01:19:59,302 --> 01:20:01,862
We`ve got to
get out of here.

1033
01:20:01,938 --> 01:20:03,530
We can`t just
leave him here.

1034
01:20:03,606 --> 01:20:05,039
Move it!

1035
01:20:05,108 --> 01:20:07,542
lt`s too late
for Axel.

1036
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:09,043
Come on.

1037
01:20:30,434 --> 01:20:33,063
Okay, you just hug along
the left side of the wall.

1038
01:20:33,138 --> 01:20:36,574
Now just keep going.
Go on. Continue.

1039
01:20:36,641 --> 01:20:39,610
- But why--
- Just do as he says.

1040
01:21:00,466 --> 01:21:02,900
TJ?

1041
01:21:02,969 --> 01:21:04,231

01:21:11,478 --> 01:21:13,912
- He`s--
- Shh!

1044
01:21:13,981 --> 01:21:15,414
Let`s go this way.

1045
01:21:15,482 --> 01:21:16,949
Come on. Go.

1046
01:21:30,231 --> 01:21:31,459
Careful.

1047
01:21:38,506 --> 01:21:39,871
Shh!

1048
01:21:42,011 --> 01:21:44,445
