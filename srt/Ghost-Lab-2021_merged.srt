1
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,916
Do you believe in the afterlife?

2
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,333
Do you believe ghosts are real?

3
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:52,958
Have you ever proven that your beliefs

4
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,416
aren't just nonsense

5
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,291
or just superstitions?

6
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:11,875
I'd like you all

7
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,708
to meet two important people

8
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,875
who will change your beliefs forever.

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

10
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,208
Damn!

11
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,375
Damn it!

12
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,416
I-- Oh.

13
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:43,583
Hey, Dr. "I'm not afraid
of ghosts," you screamed so loud.

14
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,958
I didn't say I wasn't afraid.
I said I don't believe in them.

15
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,750
Shouldn't you be sleeping
before your shift tonight?

16
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,500
-Yeah, yeah.
-Dr. Gla. Dr. Wee.

17
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,708
-Heard about the ER case the other day?
-No.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Well, there was a third-degree burn case.
He felt slighted by his wife
so he tried to commit suicide by arson.

19
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:14,750
He was burnt to a crisp when he arrived
and the whole room stank like burnt flesh.

20
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,375
That's right,

21
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,958
plus, something fell on him
and split his head half open.

22
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:25,208
I heard he wailed and twisted
and turned until he died in his bed.

23
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:28,708
Damn!

24
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:35,041
-Update me if you hear more news, Joon.
-Sure.

25
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,958
What news could there be? He died.

26
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,666
Dude, I didn't mean that
sort of news. I meant news

27
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,500
of the paranormal.

28
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,958
You're a surgeon, not a shaman.

29
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,916
That was very funny, Dr. Wee.

30
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,375
Nice clapback.

31
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,750
I have to go now.

32
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,458
Madam's physio should be done.

33
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,083
Dr. Ar-Jong to Room 237. Stat.

34
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,375
"Ar-Jong" again!

35
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,166
Dr. Ar-Jong to Room 237.

36
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,250
It's "Arj-Ong."

37
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,833
They keep calling me "Ar-Jong."

38
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,250
Shitheads.

39
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,833
They do it in meetings too.

40
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,666
Just embrace your first-year nickname.

41
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,000
I've had it since preschool, actually.

42
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,583
OK.

43
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,625
Are you ready, Dr.--

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,958
"Ar-Jong"?

45
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,541
Very funny.

46
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:40,958
RATANARAJ HOSPITAL

47
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,666
Hi.

48
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,083
Did the physio see you today?

49
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,083
Hmm?

50
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,208
Do you feel better?

51
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,916
-Are you tired?
-Hey, Gla.

52
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,416
Oh, hey, Mai.

53
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,458
What's up?

54
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:10,000
Hey, how long
has Wee's mom been at the hospital?

55
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,125
Seven years? Eight?

56
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,750
He studied medicine
because of his mom's illness.

57
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,541
His paycheck
goes back to her hospital bills.

58
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,500
This is like his home now.

59
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,458
So,

60
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,708
need a doctor, cutie?

61
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,583
Of course I do.

62
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:32,708
I feel a sharp pain in my heart
as if my partner's got no time for me.

63
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,500
Want to get food?

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,833
Let's go.

65
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:01,041
Mom, do you want me to read
you something before bedtime?

66
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,958
Or are you too tired?

67
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,791
I see. You want to sleep right now? OK.

68
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,916
MORGUE

69
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

70
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,333
-Hey!
-What?

71
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,916
Do you think there are
any ghosts here in the dark?

72
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,541
How can they exist?

73
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,625
Just think.

74
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,583
CERN's machines can detect
particles from outer space,

75
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,916
but they've never detected any ghosts.

76
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,291
But are ghosts particles?

77
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:32,125
The things you see are just photons
that strike your eyes, isn't that right?

78
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,708
Basic science.

79
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,333
Maybe ghosts aren't photons.

80
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:40,583
Maybe they're energy or matter
that CERN scientists don't know about yet.

81
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,750
Like the platypus.

82
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,791
Before the discovery

83
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,166
of the platypus,

84
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,750
no one thought mammals could lay eggs.

85
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,125
You even believe
that aliens are real, duh!

86
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,833
Hey.

87
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,958
There are good reasons to support that.

88
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,875
Life-forms can live on planets
with water, heavy elements, etc.

89
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,208
What other energy is there
besides the law of physics?

90
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,625
The power of love.

91
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,000
Hey, dude.
Are you really gonna ignore Joon?

92
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,583
Our hospital doesn't have
many beautiful nurses.

93
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:31,791
When you were giving orders back there,
I saw her looking at you, smitten.

94
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,666
I have to look after Madam.

95
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,208
I have no time for anyone else.

96
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,916
Whoa. Get some real food
if you're that hungry.

97
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:48,125
You want snacks or you want me
to kick your ass? Help me carry these.

98
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,458
Wow. You're so mean these days.

99
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:55,750
Gla.

100
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,791
Damn you, Gla. Hey.

101
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,375
Wow, you're really committing to the bit.

102
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:12,166
Excuse you. Save these pranks
for the ladies. They won't work on me.

103
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,625
Hey.

104
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

105
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,833
A ghost!

106
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,583
Damn it. Wee!

107
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,291
Shit! Did you see what I saw?
Wee, you saw that, right?

108
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,458
An actual ghost, damn it!

109
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,541
A real ghost!

110
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,083
Oh my God!

111
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,750
Damn it!

112
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,875
Wee, you saw it too?

113
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,000
An actual ghost, damn it. A real ghost!

114
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,333
Maybe we were hallucinating.

115
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,041
Identical hallucinations?

116
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,416
That's impossible.

117
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,416
I don't get it.

118
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,166
There's no way to explain this.

119
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,875
Want to find a way?

120
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:40,166
MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDING,
RATANARAJ HOSPITAL

121
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,250
Why are we at this old place?

122
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,458
It's an employee housing building.

123
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,208
This is all storage.

124
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,291
-Ouch!
-Whoa.

125
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,083
It's a damn birdhouse.

126
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,958
Does no one clean up here?

127
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,791
I asked Namo to let me
use this room for my research.

128
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,000
I like this place.

129
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,791
No cameras here.

130
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:44,916
It's convenient.

131
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,625
You need a camera-free zone
for pediatric intestine research?

132
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,458
NORTHERN LIGHTS QUEST

133
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,583
What did you want to show me?

134
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,166
I'm researching ghosts.

135
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,166
I'm sure these videos and photos online…

136
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,250
are all fake.

137
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,250
I understand

138
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,500
that in the past,
images of ghosts were rare. Makes sense.

139
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,958
But now, cameras are everywhere.

140
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,958
Even security cameras.

141
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,250
So why can't they record
any clear videos of ghosts?

142
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,333
The conclusion is
cameras can't record ghosts, damn it.

143
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,125
That movie Shutter is bullshit.

144
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,208
GHOSTS = ?

145
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,416
DESERTED CEMETERIES

146
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,625
DESERTED WAREHOUSES

147
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,500
Hey. What is this shit?

148
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,250
Ghost research?

149
00:14:58,791 --> 00:14:59,791
Are you insane?

150
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,000
In second grade, my dad died.

151
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,000
One night, after the wake,

152
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,208
I came downstairs.

153
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

154
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

155
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,500
Though I only saw him for a split second,

156
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,333
I'm confident

157
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
that it was him.

158
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,791
Since I saw Dad's ghost

159
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,666
over 20 years ago,

160
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,333
I've always wondered about ghosts.

161
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:13,958
It's my life now.

162
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,166
Last night,

163
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,250
we both saw a ghost.

164
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,416
I'm really sure

165
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,416
Dad came to me back then.

166
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,416
It's like the questions
I've asked my whole life

167
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,041
are now answered.

168
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:28,958
Just think.

169
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,333
If I found a way
for others to see ghosts like we did…

170
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,458
what would happen?

171
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,291
I believe I was born to prove

172
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,750
ghosts are real.

173
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,083
I'm in.

174
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,125
Experiment log number 38,

175
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,458
16th May, 2019.

176
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,125
We have big news
about the Northern Lights Quest.

177
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,875
"Northern Lights Quest"?

178
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,208
It's inspired by ancient Inuit people.

179
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,625
They believed
the Northern Lights were departed souls

180
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,916
communicating with the living.

181
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,625
Well, say something, Dr. Specs.

182
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,625
Right. Well…

183
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,541
-Just talk.
-What's so funny? OK--

184
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,833
Hello, I'm Cheewee.

185
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,500
N-- Next,

186
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,458
the two of us

187
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:53,750
will try to prove the existence of
and find answers about ghosts--

188
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,583
It will be one of
the most important discoveries. Like--

189
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,250
Sir Isaac Newton's laws of gravity--

190
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,125
Franklin's electricity or--

191
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,708
Einstein's Theory of Relativity.

192
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:09,583
Our work
must be published in The Experiment,

193
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,208
the world's most famous research journal.

194
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,500
What research did you do
in the past four or five years?

195
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,375
I did field research.

196
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,833
So tell me what you saw.

197
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,625
I interviewed everyone…

198
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,666
You mean ghosts?

199
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,125
I saw it over there and I got goosebumps.

200
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,166
…who saw ghosts.

201
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,541
Here?

202
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,166
I performed every superstitious ritual

203
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,750
to try and see ghosts.

204
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,291
I went to famous haunted places like

205
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,833
a cemetery in Kanchanaburi,

206
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,750
the House of Four Corpses in Chonburi,

207
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,000
an abandoned prison in Vietnam,

208
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,416
a haunted house in Korea,

209
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,208
the Suicide Forest in Japan.

210
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,875
I went to all the famous spots.

211
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,916
But I never saw ghosts anywhere.

212
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,250
Patients die here every day.

213
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,916
I've looked at all
the reported ghost sighting sites.

214
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,041
But I never saw any ghosts. Not until…

215
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,958
We both saw one by the vending machine.

216
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,666
How do you find time for this?

217
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,583
What do you think I do
while you look after Madam?

218
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,625
And if I'd told you,
you'd have said I was mad.

219
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,750
If cameras can't record ghosts,

220
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:04,541
there's only one way to prove
ghosts are real. All we can do…

221
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,666
is make people see them like we did.

222
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,958
First, we'll have to find
some mechanisms or scenarios

223
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,041
to control the ghosts' appearance.

224
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,833
APPEARANCE TRIGGER, PROOF, PUBLIC

225
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:22,833
To date, I've seen ghosts
just twice and you've seen one just once.

226
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,416
We need to see more
to find out what makes them appear.

227
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,750
OK.

228
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,000
So first, we need to…

229
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,958
FIND GHOSTS AS PARTICIPANTS

230
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,250
Alright. Good night, babe.

231
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,791
Why not tell Mai about this?

232
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,208
There's no point.

233
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,958
Hey, it's past 3 a.m. already.

234
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,208
Is her condo near here?

235
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,625
If you're sleepy,
go get some sleep. I'll stay here.

236
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,416
We've been here over a week now.

237
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,625
We've seen nothing.

238
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,000
It's not working.
Let's try something else.

239
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:14,833
A new method.

240
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,458
It's the wind.

241
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,750
Shit.

242
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,083
Damn! Wee!

243
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,708
We were so focused on visible ghosts,

244
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,375
but there are other kinds.

245
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,458
For example, poltergeists are invisible.

246
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,125
What are poltergeists?

247
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,458
Some of my interviewees

248
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,583
said they saw
objects moving, heard strange noises,

249
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,416
and often felt
the temperature suddenly drop.

250
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,125
This past week,

251
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,791
I looked at the hospital's CCTV

252
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,000
and found these images.

253
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,416
Hold on. It's crashed.

254
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,000
Come on.

255
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:17,916
You go first.

256
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,958
-Are you scared?
-I told you to go first.

257
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,791
It's so dark. Turn on the light.

258
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,000
Will it scare the ghosts away?

259
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

260
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:53,875
-Damn it.
-Hey!

261
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,208
-Sorry.
-Dumbass!

262
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,291
-What?
-Watch your step, jackass!

263
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,666
You made me hold
all this. You're holding one thing.

264
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:13,791
Which way now?

265
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,416
-Left.
-Sure. You go first.

266
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,000
Hey.

267
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,041
Why's the wheelchair here?

268
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

269
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,333
Shit.

270
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:06,916
Hey!

271
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Shit!

272
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,833
-Hey!
-It--

273
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What's the temperature?

274
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,500
Unnatural, don't you think?

275
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,916
This time,
we're one step closer to ghosts.

276
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,041
We witnessed energy
and temperature fluctuation.

277
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,583
But our videos are no better than
those that have been shared online.

278
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:04,375
Our evidence isn't solid yet.

279
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,833
I need to review my interviews.

280
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,625
I may learn more.

281
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,250
Gla, you can do it later, man.

282
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,250
Dr. Gla.

283
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,125
Are you alright?

284
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,041
-Stop the bleeding.
-Apply pressure.

285
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,500
Someone get Dr. Namo in here stat.

286
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,875
Immediately, please!

287
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,125
You messed up
the tracheotomy. You nicked the thyroid.

288
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,416
Do better, top student.

289
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:09,708
Your late-night research is your business.

290
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:11,708
But you should know

291
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,583
that doctors' stupid mistakes

292
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,750
cost patients' lives.

293
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,166
Yes.

294
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,958
Certainly. Thank you so much.

295
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,083
Gla.

296
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,833
-Hmm?
-I have bad news.

297
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,000
Listen,

298
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,250
in December,

299
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:47,416
I have to oversee
a condo project in Pattaya.

300
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,583
Can we postpone
our Northern Lights trip to, like,

301
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,541
around next February?

302
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:58,833
-Oh.
-Hmm?

303
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,500
If that's convenient.

304
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,916
Hey! Wait a minute.

305
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,583
Are you being smooth?

306
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,250
You forgot about our trip?

307
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,000
I can tell. I know you.

308
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:21,500
Sorry, babe.

309
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,333
I hardly see you now.

310
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:28,958
It's fine.

311
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:33,083
When you're obsessed with work,

312
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,708
it's so terribly sexy.

313
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:43,666
I have to go.

314
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,833
Sure.

315
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:49,500
I'm going now.

316
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,000
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye, babe.

317
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:32,666
FIND GHOSTS AS PARTICIPANTS,
APPEARANCE TRIGGER, PROOF

318
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,458
Your platypus story gave me an idea.

319
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:39,375
-Tell me, how do we classify animals?
-What? Why?

320
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:40,708
How do we group them?

321
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:42,750
We use criteria.

322
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:45,125
Some are vertebrates.

323
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:46,750
Some lay eggs. Some don't.

324
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:51,166
-The number of legs varies.
-How might we classify ghosts?

325
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:58,375
Have you noticed that when we saw ghosts,

326
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:01,875
we knew some of them,
but some of them were strangers?

327
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:05,666
-We knew some.
-Uh-huh.

328
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,083
-Like my dad.
-That's right.

329
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,916
The burn victim was a stranger to us.

330
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,083
KNOWN VS UNKNOWN

331
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,041
Just think.

332
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,291
Unknown ghosts.

333
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,916
Why do they appear to us?

334
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:25,166
-I don't know, man.
-Exactly. We don't know. It's dumb luck.

335
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,875
Consider the known ghosts.

336
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,708
Why did your dad's ghost come to you?

337
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,875
Maybe he missed me or wanted to see me.

338
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,750
If we focus on ghosts we know,

339
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:40,625
we'll know where
and with whom to go find them.

340
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:41,541
We could try

341
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:45,708
observing someone
whose relative or lover has recently died.

342
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:48,291
The only problem is…

343
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,750
who'd let us do that all night?

344
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:55,666
Especially if they know
we're researching ghosts!

345
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,083
We can't do that.

346
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:01,708
Here's another way.

347
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:04,625
Don't be afraid.

348
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:06,791
Alright?

349
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:15,541
I know this girl,

350
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:20,291
a first-year student who's
in the final stage of cancer.

351
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,375
I heard she's single.

352
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,583
Imagine that.

353
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,291
She's never dated and she's dying.

354
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:30,083
But if you or I

355
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:33,166
become her first and only boyfriend,

356
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,833
when she's gone,
she'll surely come back to us.

357
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,791
Are we going too far?

358
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:45,125
Fooling a dying person for our experiment?

359
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,250
I think we'd be crossing the line.

360
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,416
So what?

361
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:56,416
She gets some love
before she dies. We get a participant. So,

362
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,208
win-win, right? Wee?

363
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:01,916
That feeling when we saw the ghost…

364
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,541
The universe opened
its door of secrets to us.

365
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,583
My curiosity's unstoppable now.

366
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:21,708
Hello?

367
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:26,083
What?

368
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:39,166
The brain can survive
without oxygen for three minutes.

369
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,041
The brain can survive
without oxygen for three minutes…

370
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,250
I resuscitated her.

371
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,375
She's still unresponsive.

372
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,666
Mucus blocked
her airway awhile before we arrived.

373
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:55,458
No oxygen reached her brain
for seven minutes. You have to choose.

374
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,583
-Hey!
-Hey, Wee!

375
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:18,416
Mom…

376
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:21,625
do you remember…

377
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:27,166
the robot you bought me when I was a kid?

378
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:35,083
One day, I threw it a bit too hard,
and after that, it couldn't walk anymore.

379
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,791
Back then, you said

380
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,333
that it couldn't walk…

381
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,750
because it was broken inside…

382
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,458
and we'd be able to fix it.

383
00:34:57,916 --> 00:34:58,791
But…

384
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:04,583
I know what's wrong with you,

385
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:11,416
so why can't I help you at all?

386
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:26,666
So you're sure

387
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,291
the afterlife's real?

388
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,875
Do you want to go now, Mom?

389
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:42,875
Am I torturing you here?

390
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:50,291
I believe

391
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:52,291
that it's real.

392
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,000
I'll let you go, Mom.

393
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,083
Please come back to see me.

394
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,458
There's no new patient here yet,

395
00:36:57,541 --> 00:36:58,916
so I installed a camera

396
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:01,541
to capture any weird movements.

397
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:06,500
And tonight,

398
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,125
I think I should be by Wee's side.

399
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:32,083
Mom?

400
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:50,958
Mom!

401
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:19,666
Mom seemed to be saying
something, but I couldn't tell what.

402
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:26,500
I saw her crying.

403
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,916
Did I make the wrong choice?

404
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,583
Maybe the truth is

405
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,000
she didn't want me to let her go.

406
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,916
After that day,

407
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,916
Mom never let me see her again.

408
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:06,500
I have so many questions in my head,

409
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:09,958
I feel like I'm drowning.

410
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:22,208
So I decided to do PHQ-9, fMRI,
as well as blood and urine lab tests

411
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,625
for chemical imbalances.

412
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,666
We found nothing.

413
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:41,500
That means

414
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:44,958
I'm not depressed
because of what happened.

415
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,166
Therefore, my decision

416
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,750
isn't influenced by anything else.

417
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,916
I will cross over.

418
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,916
"Cross over"? To where?

419
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:31,208
I'll die and go to the other side,

420
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,541
and I'll come back
to do the experiment with you.

421
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,708
Dude. Chill, man.

422
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:41,333
It's what we need
for our experiment to continue.

423
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:45,333
Even if the cancer patient fell for you,

424
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:46,875
even if she came to you,

425
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,291
how much could you experiment with her?

426
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,041
She could disappear
in an instant like your dad.

427
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:58,291
She doesn't know our experiment
like us or understand what we're doing.

428
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,750
Only I can come back for our experiment.

429
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:01,833
Snap out of it.

430
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,416
You're upset about your mom.

431
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,083
You're just depressed, so you're suicidal.

432
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:12,166
Wee, listen to me, damn it.

433
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:16,250
You lost your mom,

434
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,666
but you didn't lose everything.

435
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,791
-You still have so much to do.
-Like what?

436
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:24,916
Huh?

437
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:27,833
What's left to do?

438
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:31,083
Why care if I die?

439
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:32,041
You're my friend!

440
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:33,666
And you're my friend too.

441
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,541
I'm doing your experiment.

442
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:40,250
Since we saw that ghost together,

443
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:43,791
and my mom came back to see me,

444
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:46,250
I'm not afraid of the afterlife anymore.

445
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,041
In this world,

446
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:52,083
there's no one left for me to worry about.

447
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,833
I just want to see my mom.

448
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:04,166
I wanna know what she said.

449
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:10,958
You're the one who told me

450
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:15,208
"the universe has opened
its door of secrets to us"

451
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:16,958
and you expect me to do nothing?

452
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:20,625
It's not unusual, Gla.

453
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:25,541
Lots of scientists trade
their lives for discoveries.

454
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:27,416
Didn't you say so yourself?

455
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,208
That you were born to do this?

456
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:35,791
This is it! This is how you prove it!

457
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:38,083
You don't understand shit!

458
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:40,333
I got you into this!

459
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:42,958
How can I let you die?

460
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:46,083
Think it through.

461
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,125
I can't let you die for this!

462
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:50,291
Don't stop me!

463
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:55,166
You'll get a participant.
I'll get to see my mom.

464
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:57,125
Win-win, yeah?

465
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:16,958
Just admit it.

466
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,625
This is the only way
our experiment can continue.

467
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:36,791
If someone must die,

468
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:39,750
it will be me.

469
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,208
What the hell?

470
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:49,375
Fine, I admit it.

471
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:52,333
Yeah, you're right.

472
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,625
This is the only way we can continue.

473
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,500
But I started this project.

474
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:03,166
-This crucial task should be mine!
-You're talking shit. I volunteer!

475
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,666
I volunteer too!

476
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:07,375
I will die

477
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:10,083
for the research I started.

478
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:11,500
I have that right too!

479
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:24,958
So let's make it fair.

480
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:37,000
If it's heads,

481
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:38,958
I'll go.

482
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:40,958
If it's tails,

483
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:43,666
you'll go.

484
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,375
Whatever the result is,

485
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
you'll accept it.

486
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:01,041
I thought it through.

487
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,583
I'll write a suicide note.

488
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,916
I'll say I got depressed

489
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:10,625
after my mom died.

490
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:13,708
You'll just pretend you found my body.

491
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:17,791
Forensics will say
that I killed myself for sure.

492
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,625
Just keep our experiment secret

493
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:24,083
so the cops won't bother us.

494
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:34,458
I'll wait on the other side to see
our names on that front cover.

495
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:38,791
A free solo mountain climber,

496
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:42,500
or a climber who uses
bare hands and no cables or safety gear,

497
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:44,541
has fatally fallen off a cliff

498
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:46,458
attempting to set a new record

499
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:48,833
by climbing at Yosemite National Park

500
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:51,125
in the US state of California.

501
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:52,958
Why do people do this stuff?

502
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:55,625
What do they get from it?

503
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:58,541
Is it worth dying for?

504
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:13,041
Experiment log number 65,

505
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,833
23rd August, 2019.

506
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:21,833
Every life has an ending.

507
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:26,875
But what
are we going to use that ending for?

508
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,166
True science

509
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,166
is the journey from ignorance

510
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:34,541
to knowledge,

511
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:38,208
from stupidity to wisdom,

512
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:42,208
from mystery to enlightenment.

513
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:46,291
My journey today

514
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:50,458
will bring us closer to
the truth of the universe.

515
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:53,625
This video clip will record

516
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:58,208
my entire journey to the other side.

517
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:02,416
Dr. Arjong Soonyata

518
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,750
will conduct the research on this side.

519
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,166
If I don't return soon,

520
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:13,291
Dr. Ar-Jong may have to work harder.

521
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:20,083
I think

522
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:21,791
it's time

523
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:25,375
for us to begin our journey.

524
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:52,833
I don't know what it'll be like there.

525
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,416
But I will do everything
to make contact with you.

526
00:50:58,166 --> 00:51:01,916
And you have to do
everything you can to contact me too.

527
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,208
I swear I will, man.

528
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,666
I won't stop until you get back,

529
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:08,708
until we succeed.

530
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:44,916
Shit!

531
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I was born to prove ghosts are real.

532
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:40,333
I'm in.

533
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:44,333
Our work must be published
in the most famous research journal.

534
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:49,833
I'll wait on the other side to see
our names on that front cover.

535
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:52,625
Come back to me, Mom.

536
00:52:57,125 --> 00:52:59,000
What are you two doing, honey?

537
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:13,666
Mom!

538
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:38,125
I can't do it.

539
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:40,875
I really can't. My mom, she…

540
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:45,000
I'm sorry.

541
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:54,125
It's OK, man.

542
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:56,333
I'll come back.

543
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:32,000
-Doctor, it's your cue.
-Alright.

544
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,291
Have you ever proven
that your beliefs aren't just nonsense

545
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:37,875
or just superstitions?

546
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:38,833
Ready?

547
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:41,625
I'd like you all to meet
two important people

548
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:45,083
who will change your beliefs forever.

549
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:01,875
Do you believe in the afterlife?

550
00:55:02,458 --> 00:55:05,041
And spirits? What do you think they are?

551
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:06,666
I, Dr. Cheewee Prometheus,

552
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,500
and Dr. Arjong Soonyata,

553
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:10,291
our key research participant,

554
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:12,666
are standing side by side right now.

555
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:17,000
We'll now present our results
as seen in the world-class journal,

556
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:18,041
The Experiment.

557
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:20,750
You are the first group to witness this.

558
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,166
Are you ready,

559
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:24,791
Dr. Ar-Jong?

560
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:38,500
It doesn't work!

561
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:40,250
Dr. Cheewee,

562
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:44,333
I'm happy for… your success.

563
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:48,041
But for this discovery,
which you say is so amazing,

564
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:51,333
were you really willing
to sacrifice a person's life?

565
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:58,875
Do you even have a heart?

566
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,750
You let your friend kill himself

567
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:05,541
for an experiment
you don't know will succeed or not.

568
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:09,750
You're not the researcher
or scientist you think you are.

569
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:13,875
You're a murderer.

570
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,541
Mai.

571
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:23,625
Hey. No!

572
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:04,750
NO CONTACT

573
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:09,541
ON-CALL ROOM SUICIDE!

574
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:11,041
WHY DID DOC SHOOT SELF?

575
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:13,250
DOC KILLS SELF IN HAUNTED HOSPITAL!

576
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:14,958
TRAGIC DOC'S MOTIVE UNKNOWN

577
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,791
I tried everything I could

578
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:31,500
to stop Wee's thoughts.

579
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:41,750
I never thought of this method.

580
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,875
But once he said it,
my heart started beating hard.

581
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:50,041
I felt…

582
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:52,500
Damn!

583
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:56,291
Is this the solution we seek?

584
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:05,291
I'll come back.

585
00:58:15,916 --> 00:58:16,750
I'm sorry.

586
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:25,791
Come back now.

587
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:33,250
Gla donated his body
to the hospital for educational purposes…

588
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:34,291
DR. ARJONG

589
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:35,958
…to benefit others.

590
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:38,750
But the monk said

591
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:41,791
that suicide is a grave sin.

592
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:46,958
I'm doing everything
to make him pure like anyone else.

593
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:50,583
Wee, do you think

594
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:53,208
what I'm doing

595
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:57,833
will help Gla find peace, sweetheart?

596
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,208
Thank you, Wee.

597
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:15,625
I'll bring it all to his mom.

598
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:20,791
Could you think it over again?

599
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,916
Why would Gla do this?

600
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,791
I really don't know.

601
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:32,875
I'm sorry.

602
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:52,916
Not knowing anything

603
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:56,208
really freaking hurts.

604
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:01,833
It's like I meant nothing to him.

605
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:55,333
Shit!

606
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:20,416
Whoa! Shit!

607
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:32,875
Jackass!

608
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,500
You're back, asshole?

609
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:41,916
It's you, right?

610
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:47,125
Gla!

611
01:02:49,791 --> 01:02:50,625
Gla?

612
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:58,166
You're here?

613
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,041
You're back? Why can't I see you?

614
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:02,166
Why don't you show yourself to me?

615
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:10,791
Maybe… you can't show yourself yet.

616
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:13,541
Communicate.

617
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,208
Make sounds. Or--

618
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,333
Or do whatever you can.

619
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:18,958
Do your poltergeist shit.

620
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:01,833
Hey… you're communicating with me, right?

621
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:06,125
Why can't you communicate more?

622
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:11,000
I was falling and you pulled me back!

623
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:20,791
Hold on.

624
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:24,833
You saved me when I was falling?

625
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:30,333
Let me guess.

626
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:32,166
What boosts your power

627
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:34,958
is me being in danger, right?

628
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:38,416
If I put myself at risk again,

629
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,750
will it boost your energy again?

630
01:05:15,291 --> 01:05:16,208
I'm a surgeon.

631
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:20,416
Save my finger, OK?

632
01:05:22,916 --> 01:05:23,750
Dr. Wee?

633
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:26,000
Shit.

634
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:30,250
Please sign the schedule.
I called but you didn't pick up.

635
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,166
Alright.

636
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:51,208
Shit!

637
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:05,291
Is my hypothesis correct?

638
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:06,416
Is my idea right?

639
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:25,625
Ghost participant

640
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,166
found. You're back.

641
01:06:28,916 --> 01:06:31,541
Next, we need to find
a way for you to appear.

642
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:34,750
So do you know what ghosts are now?

643
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:40,958
Gla's return doesn't answer
all the questions we're asking,

644
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:42,458
but we've learned a lot.

645
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:45,916
First of all, Gla can't see other ghosts.

646
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,125
How about there? Can you see anything?

647
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:51,791
Secondly,

648
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,666
he only sees what's around me.

649
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:57,500
He says that before this, he saw nothing,

650
01:06:58,916 --> 01:07:00,250
until I jumped.

651
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:05,416
Suddenly, he saw me and saved me.

652
01:07:06,333 --> 01:07:11,666
It's like something connects
me to Gla, who's in the afterlife.

653
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,458
That means the soul's power increases

654
01:07:16,041 --> 01:07:17,750
when triggered by something.

655
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:24,708
In our case,
Gla was worried about me being in danger.

656
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,041
Let's say ghosts are natural phenomena.

657
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:30,750
If ghosts are like wind…

658
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:33,166
Wind, initially, can't be seen, right?

659
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:36,541
But add air pressure
to wind and you get a storm,

660
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:40,958
which can increase in both speed and size.

661
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:42,416
And then,

662
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:45,375
when that mixes with water vapor,

663
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,708
it creates an electric charge. Finally,

664
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:49,625
we will see…

665
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:57,375
the shape of an actual storm. I believe

666
01:07:57,916 --> 01:08:00,666
that if I can boost your power like this,

667
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:04,000
you'll be able to appear for sure, man.

668
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:12,208
"Weird"? How are my thoughts weird?

669
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:17,750
"Beach"?

670
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,458
No beach pictures in here.

671
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:24,916
Where do you see a beach?

672
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:31,291
Gone already?

673
01:08:37,916 --> 01:08:41,083
W-- What stupid beach
are you talking about?

674
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,208
Aunt Koy?

675
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:55,583
This picture…

676
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:57,708
Where was this?

677
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:00,583
Oh, that was taken in Ranong.

678
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:03,041
It's Gla's hometown.

679
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:07,416
When his dad passed away,
I moved back to Bangkok.

680
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,916
You said you wanted to talk to me

681
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:19,916
about Gla.

682
01:09:22,916 --> 01:09:23,750
What is it?

683
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,125
Well…

684
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:37,958
I saw Gla in a dream.

685
01:09:43,083 --> 01:09:45,041
He told me to tell you something.

686
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:47,875
He said…

687
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:51,791
he's still around.

688
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,666
He can't be reborn yet.

689
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:01,041
What do I need to do?

690
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:03,916
Did he tell you?

691
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:10,625
I guess suicide is a very serious sin.

692
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:16,208
I'm afraid that he's going to
carry on as a wandering ghost.

693
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:31,375
I got goosebumps.

694
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:34,458
Wee, do you feel it too?

695
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:38,416
-I do.
-Maybe Gla is here somewhere.

696
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:43,208
Mom.

697
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:48,833
Excuse me, Wee.

698
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:52,208
What you're saying is upsetting my mom.

699
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:57,416
Plus, you're a doctor. You aren't
supposed to believe in this stuff?

700
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:01,833
I'm just worried for Gla.

701
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:05,833
What you said…

702
01:11:07,916 --> 01:11:09,666
don't you think it hurts Gla?

703
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:13,291
He might be here with us now.

704
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:14,708
That's nonsense.

705
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,541
You're only hurting my mom more.

706
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:20,625
You should leave.

707
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:22,166
Please go.

708
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:25,041
-Gift.
-Hush, Mom.

709
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:41,000
"Kha Kai."

710
01:11:52,916 --> 01:11:54,041
I just remembered.

711
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:57,916
In my dream, Gla said, "Kha Kai."

712
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,916
"Chicken legs"?

713
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:00,916
I don't get it either,

714
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,791
but he really said, "Kha Kai."

715
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:09,250
Wee.

716
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:12,958
Do stay for dinner.

717
01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:21,291
Gla loved my Kha Kai curry.

718
01:12:24,416 --> 01:12:25,250
Oh.

719
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:28,000
He meant curry.

720
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,875
He must want me to offer alms for him,

721
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:33,583
so he told you.

722
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:39,000
Whoa.

723
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,666
Wow. Your cooking is amazing, Aunt Koy.

724
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:46,333
You could open your own restaurant.

725
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:54,833
That's what Gla said too.

726
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:58,333
Gla complimented me.

727
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,166
He said my curry was so good

728
01:13:00,791 --> 01:13:02,500
that I could run a restaurant.

729
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:05,541
I didn't buy that.

730
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:08,958
So he dared me. He said
he'd have you come to taste it.

731
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:22,041
He said you'd say the same thing.

732
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,916
Gla said that I'm not confident…

733
01:13:32,416 --> 01:13:34,666
that I think I'm not good at anything.

734
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,083
He said, "But

735
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:43,583
if that's true,

736
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:46,958
how did you raise your kids alone?"

737
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:53,083
He said, "You raised a doctor, right?"

738
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,833
"Compared to that, Kha Kai is so easy."

739
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:01,833
"Why won't you believe
you're a great cook?"

740
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,000
Thank you, Wee.

741
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:17,250
Now I understand
what Gla wanted to tell me.

742
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:42,916
The curry brought your mom peace.

743
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:46,083
Did you derail my experiment on purpose?

744
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:54,208
You know the plan.

745
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:58,125
I'm trying to make you worry
as much as I can. It worked, see?

746
01:15:08,541 --> 01:15:09,500
I understand

747
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,416
if you don't like me doing this.

748
01:15:14,666 --> 01:15:16,583
But it's for the experiment.

749
01:15:22,416 --> 01:15:23,250
Right now?

750
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:34,250
So is this the beach
in Ranong, your hometown?

751
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:38,500
Hey, Gla!

752
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:40,875
Gla! Hey!

753
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:43,458
Damn it, Gla!

754
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:49,458
Gla has been missing for three days.

755
01:15:51,625 --> 01:15:52,750
Is this normal?

756
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:56,791
Does every spirit have this phase?

757
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:02,166
Or maybe he left
because he's consoled his mom.

758
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,166
WORLD OF THE LIVING

759
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:07,833
GLA

760
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:09,625
Or is the beach another world

761
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:13,125
the dead have to
cross to, like how some folks say

762
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,666
"the dead go to find peace."

763
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,083
Come back.

764
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:47,750
Three…

765
01:16:51,541 --> 01:16:52,416
two…

766
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,000
one!

767
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:15,625
Wee. If you have any problems

768
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:17,500
or stress, you can tell me.

769
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,125
Or the hospital

770
01:17:20,208 --> 01:17:21,833
has professionals who can help--

771
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:22,958
Meaning what?

772
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:28,666
A nurse says you tried
this once before. Is it true?

773
01:17:32,666 --> 01:17:34,041
Who maims themselves?

774
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:41,666
-So is it true?
-I can handle it. I don't need help.

775
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:53,375
Shit.

776
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:57,875
Oh, hi, Mai.

777
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:03,375
Why are you here?

778
01:18:04,916 --> 01:18:06,000
I came to see you

779
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:08,125
to ask you this.

780
01:18:08,791 --> 01:18:10,833
The day I returned Gla's stuff,

781
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:13,166
his laptop was missing.

782
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:14,875
The one with the red cover.

783
01:18:15,583 --> 01:18:19,083
It's not at his mom's place
and the cops didn't take it.

784
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:21,125
Have you seen it?

785
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:25,458
I haven't.

786
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:30,666
I'll look for it and let you know ASAP.

787
01:18:33,958 --> 01:18:35,583
OK. I understand.

788
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:37,916
I have to go.

789
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:47,750
Mai.

790
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,708
Gla chose to do what he did.

791
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:56,458
Looking for answers
is putting you through pain.

792
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:01,916
So can you stand it?

793
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:04,750
Wondering and never knowing?

794
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:22,250
Shit.

795
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:45,333
How'd you get in?

796
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:48,541
-Let me explain--
-About hiding Gla's laptop?

797
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:50,500
-Mai--
-Explain to the cops.

798
01:19:50,583 --> 01:19:52,666
Mai, no! Hey! Mai, wait.

799
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:55,083
Mai, listen to me first.

800
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:58,458
I found his laptop
two days ago, in the trunk of my car.

801
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:03,041
Earlier, I had to lie about not finding it

802
01:20:03,541 --> 01:20:07,958
because you made it sound like
the laptop was evidence. That scared me.

803
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:11,208
I swear I knew nothing about it.

804
01:20:11,291 --> 01:20:13,125
I want to know Gla's story too.

805
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:17,333
But his laptop is locked.

806
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,458
I can't get in.

807
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:33,916
Hey. We've tried for almost an hour.

808
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:36,000
We've gotten nowhere.

809
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,291
It'll be easier to hire an expert.

810
01:20:40,416 --> 01:20:42,083
I know this friend

811
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:44,000
with IT qualifications.

812
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:45,958
Should I ask them?

813
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:48,458
Sure.

814
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:52,791
Alright. I'll take it to my friend ASAP.

815
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:02,500
You think I'm that stupid?

816
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:06,541
You're lying.

817
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:09,041
People like Gla

818
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,375
never just suddenly kill themselves.

819
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:15,416
I was his girlfriend.

820
01:21:16,416 --> 01:21:17,625
I knew him the best.

821
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,708
I've been his friend for longer.

822
01:21:48,625 --> 01:21:49,791
So what now?

823
01:21:52,291 --> 01:21:54,125
Do I have to just accept it?

824
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:57,625
That all this time
I didn't know Gla at all?

825
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,666
I should have known

826
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,166
what Gla was thinking.

827
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:07,750
The night
before he killed himself, I was with him.

828
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:12,500
I was with him in this room.
I should have known what he was thinking.

829
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:20,250
Why didn't he tell me
that something was wrong?

830
01:22:20,916 --> 01:22:21,791
Or maybe

831
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:24,541
he tried to tell me,

832
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:27,083
but I didn't listen.

833
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,416
Didn't I pay attention or…

834
01:22:30,458 --> 01:22:33,500
What was wrong?
Was I such an awful girlfriend?

835
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,250
Was I so shitty that I didn't know
what was wrong with my boyfriend?

836
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:41,833
What was wrong?

837
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,000
Breathe, Mai.

838
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:46,750
I mean, look.

839
01:22:47,416 --> 01:22:49,708
Even my boyfriend's password.

840
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:55,333
-I don't even know it, shit!
-Mai.

841
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's alright.

842
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:42,875
I'll take this to my friend.

843
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:44,375
We might unlock it tonight.

844
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:55,416
What the fuck, man?

845
01:23:56,666 --> 01:24:00,041
Didn't we agree
that no one could know about the research?

846
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:03,291
If Mai finds out,
she'll tell someone for sure.

847
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:06,041
What happens to it then? Do you care?

848
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:22,916
You were MIA so long.

849
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:26,416
You came back to tell your girl the truth?

850
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,916
I called for you, remember?

851
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:30,916
Why didn't you come?

852
01:24:33,916 --> 01:24:36,333
Do you still care about what we're doing?

853
01:24:37,541 --> 01:24:38,375
Huh?

854
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Forget her!
Let her feel guilty. It won't kill her.

855
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:15,125
Whoa!

856
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:32,541
Shit!

857
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:39,833
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

858
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
The elevator's stuck
on the 13th floor. Please help me.
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

859
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:52,541
Shit.

860
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:15,083
It's hot.

861
01:27:16,916 --> 01:27:19,416
So you'll tell me the truth about Gla?

862
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:21,583
You found out more?

863
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:23,208
Yep.

864
01:27:25,416 --> 01:27:27,000
I asked you to meet me here

865
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,833
so you could see for yourself.

866
01:27:32,208 --> 01:27:33,708
You'll understand it all.

867
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:37,625
I have to go and prepare something.

868
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:39,416
I'll be back.

869
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:58,666
At Mai's condo yesterday,

870
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:02,583
I learned of another way
to boost the spirit's power.

871
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:10,000
ENERGY = WORRIES

872
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:16,791
ENERGY = WORRIES / VENGEANCE

873
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:27,250
Oh! Wow! I thought
that you weren't coming back anymore!

874
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:30,166
How's the beach?

875
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:32,208
Huh?

876
01:29:38,666 --> 01:29:40,416
Experiment log number 103.

877
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,041
I decided to redesign
the experiment again.

878
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:46,000
This time, I'm sure that it will succeed.

879
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:51,458
So close now.

880
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:55,125
I'm this close to making the ghost appear.

881
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:14,458
Hey!

882
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:22,166
You said it yourself.

883
01:30:23,333 --> 01:30:26,125
You want Mai to know
about the experiment. Look!

884
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,125
I got her to participate.

885
01:30:31,791 --> 01:30:32,750
Isn't this good?

886
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:37,708
You want this, right?

887

Hey!

888
01:30:54,041 --> 01:30:55,666
Deep down, you know, right?

889
01:30:57,375 --> 01:30:58,208
The truth is

890
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,166
I like Mai too.

891
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:02,833
Oh, right.

892
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,625
I forgot that you're dead.

893
01:31:06,291 --> 01:31:07,291
Shit. Sorry, man.

894
01:31:10,583 --> 01:31:12,000
You mind if I take Mai

895
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:13,375
for myself?

Tell me.

Gla!

904
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,041
You can show yourself now.

905
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:42,500
Can you hear me?

01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:45,458

01:35:28,541 --> 01:35:29,375
Shit.

913
01:35:41,666 --> 01:35:43,041
Experiment log

914
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:46,291
number 104.

915
01:35:47,166 --> 01:35:48,583
The results show that…

916
01:35:51,708 --> 01:35:53,000
using his girlfriend

917
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:57,083
to trigger negative emotions…

918
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:03,041
made the spirit of Dr. Arjong…

919
01:36:07,416 --> 01:36:09,958
show his true form for the first time.

920
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:13,833
This is our first time
seeing his "Northern Lights."

921
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:26,958
Fuck you, Gla!

922
01:36:27,583 --> 01:36:28,416
Not so hard!

923
01:36:31,916 --> 01:36:33,375
Now I know what to do.

924
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:36,125
Now, if you wanna expose the truth

925
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:37,500
or deal with someone,

926
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:39,625
I'll set it up. Maybe next time,

927
01:36:40,166 --> 01:36:41,291
I'll get your sis--

928
01:36:58,833 --> 01:36:59,666
Hey!

929
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

930
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:07,541
Hey--

931
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:11,541
You can get back in your body?

932
01:38:13,583 --> 01:38:14,416
Damn, this is

933
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:17,375
even more than we expected.

934
01:38:18,208 --> 01:38:21,166
If I can keep you
in this form for everyone to see…

935
01:38:24,958 --> 01:38:27,000
Our experiment is coming together!

936
01:38:29,708 --> 01:38:30,708
I must film this.

937
01:38:32,291 --> 01:38:33,416
Let me record this.

938
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

939
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,625
Wasn't it you who told me…

940
01:38:56,041 --> 01:38:57,958
"If we really want the truth,

941
01:39:00,708 --> 01:39:02,375
we must cross the line"?

942
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:10,916
When you shot yourself…

943
01:39:13,541 --> 01:39:16,333
you didn't even think
of your mom, or Gift,

944
01:39:16,875 --> 01:39:18,000
or even Mai at all!

945
01:39:20,958 --> 01:39:24,416
You really want to go
to your beloved  beach?

946
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:26,791
I won't let you.

947
01:39:28,583 --> 01:39:30,291
We've come this far already.

948
01:39:31,041 --> 01:39:32,291
I have to finish it.

949
01:39:34,083 --> 01:39:35,583
Whatever shit I must do,

950
01:39:36,291 --> 01:39:37,125
I will do it!

951
01:40:01,083 --> 01:40:02,083
Whoa!

952
01:41:25,166 --> 01:41:26,875
How did we get to this point?

953
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:34,083
Gla.

954
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:41,875
I've become a monster.

955
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:46,875
And I'm turning you into one too.

956
01:41:53,125 --> 01:41:54,250
Wee.

957
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:56,333
Thanks, man.

958
01:41:57,791 --> 01:41:58,916
You kept your word.

959
01:42:00,541 --> 01:42:01,791
Now you must stop.

960
01:42:03,625 --> 01:42:04,458
No way, Gla.

961
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:07,916
If you don't stop,

962
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:12,500
what other evil things
will you do for the experiment?

963
01:42:20,666 --> 01:42:22,583
But we've come this far already.

964
01:42:24,916 --> 01:42:26,208
We're almost there.

965
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,250
To reach this point,

966
01:42:30,458 --> 01:42:32,041
what did you have to sacrifice?

967
01:42:36,666 --> 01:42:38,916
I've hurt enough people around me.

968
01:42:42,916 --> 01:42:44,416
Everything must stop here.

969
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:54,833
Are you telling me
to let you die for free?

970
01:43:08,333 --> 01:43:09,166
Wee…

971
01:43:11,666 --> 01:43:13,166
you did your best for me…

972
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:16,083
for your mom,

973
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:19,375
and for this experiment.

974
01:43:22,041 --> 01:43:23,958
You don't have to feel guilty anymore.

975
01:43:49,208 --> 01:43:50,208
I have to go now.

976
01:43:53,083 --> 01:43:54,291
My journey goes on.

977
01:44:00,041 --> 01:44:00,875
Damn you, Gla!

978
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:12,333
Gla!

979
01:45:27,041 --> 01:45:29,291
Sir, everything that happened

980
01:45:29,375 --> 01:45:32,166
was caused by his severe emotional trauma.

981
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:33,916
after the loss of his mother

982
01:45:34,958 --> 01:45:36,500
and his friend's suicide.

983
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:41,333
I know you want to protect your resident.

984
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,666
But the Council must investigate.

985
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,666
He may never practice again.

986
01:46:32,916 --> 01:46:36,083
In my first year, I once asked Gla

987
01:46:37,125 --> 01:46:39,500
why he was so fascinated with science.

988
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,875
He told me

989
01:46:43,666 --> 01:46:45,166
that every day we live

990
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:47,666
is like a science experiment.

991
01:46:50,708 --> 01:46:51,875
We set hypotheses

992
01:46:52,583 --> 01:46:54,333
and our expectations.

993
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:58,666
We try to control the variables.

994
01:47:02,083 --> 01:47:04,750
Some are controllable. Some aren't.

995
01:47:08,916 --> 01:47:10,583
Sometimes what's been done

996
01:47:11,875 --> 01:47:13,541
is almost completely ruined.

997
01:47:20,791 --> 01:47:22,458
Whatever the result is…

998
01:47:28,458 --> 01:47:30,458
we still learn something from it,

999
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,125
more or less.

1000
01:47:33,208 --> 01:47:35,958
NORTHERN LIGHTS QUEST

1001
01:47:42,416 --> 01:47:45,666
NORTHERN LIGHTS QUEST

1002
01:48:03,916 --> 01:48:05,625
I got the laptop unlocked.

1003
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:16,416
Mai, listen…

1004
01:48:22,833 --> 01:48:23,666
That night--

1005
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:25,875
Wee. You don't have to say anything.

1006
01:48:28,333 --> 01:48:29,541
I talked to Namo.

1007
01:48:31,083 --> 01:48:35,250
I know. Back then,
you weren't really emotionally stable.

1008
01:48:39,541 --> 01:48:40,500
And maybe…

1009
01:48:43,291 --> 01:48:45,541
I wasn't in my right mind yet either.

1010
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:49,875
You know what?

1011
01:48:51,333 --> 01:48:53,666
The night I fell asleep in your office,

1012
01:48:55,583 --> 01:48:56,416
I think…

1013
01:48:59,041 --> 01:49:00,375
Gla came to see me.

1014
01:49:05,583 --> 01:49:06,458
In my dream,

1015
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:08,875
we were at the seaside.

1016
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:14,583
But I don't know where exactly.

1017
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:52,250
In my dream, I didn't say anything to him.

1018
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:57,958
Just seeing him happy

1019
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,666
was enough to make me so happy.

1020
01:50:18,875 --> 01:50:19,708
Hey, Wee.

1021
01:50:21,375 --> 01:50:22,208
In my dream,

1022
01:50:24,666 --> 01:50:26,791
Gla was holding this magazine.

1023
01:50:28,333 --> 01:50:30,458
On the cover was a photo of you two.

1024
01:50:58,583 --> 01:50:59,791
Wee.

1025
01:51:03,791 --> 01:51:04,916
I'm jealous of you.

1026
01:51:07,833 --> 01:51:09,083
You still have a chance.

1027
01:51:16,541 --> 01:51:18,416
Live your life for the both of us.

1028
01:51:25,791 --> 01:51:26,916
I think he's right.

1029
01:51:30,208 --> 01:51:31,833
We just have to learn from it.

1030
01:51:36,666 --> 01:51:37,791
As long as we live,

1031
01:51:38,458 --> 01:51:41,250
we must continue
our experiments until the end.

1032
01:57:02,541 --> 01:57:05,541
