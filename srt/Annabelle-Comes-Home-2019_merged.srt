2
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,357
It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

3
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,125
And through that,

4
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:39,759
the inhuman spirit
tricked you.

5
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:42,496
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

6
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:44,798
What's an inhuman spirit?

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,866
It's something
that's never

8
00:00:45,868 --> 00:00:48,668
walked the earth
in human form.

9
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,170
It's something demonic.

10
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:53,573
So,
the doll was never possessed?

11
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:56,477
No,
it was used as a conduit.

12
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,346
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

13
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:02,149
Demonic spirits
don't possess things.

14
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:04,218
They possess people.

15
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,620
It wanted to
get inside of you.

16
00:01:06,622 --> 00:01:09,723
And given
this unusual feature,

17
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:12,325
the doll will need to be
properly cared for.

18
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:13,727
- Cared for?
- Mmm-hmm.

19
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:15,398
It should be destroyed.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,801
That would
only make things worse.

21
00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:23,239
We think it best
the doll come with us.

22
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:26,873
We'll keep it somewhere safe.

23
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,376
That sounds like
a great idea.

24
00:01:29,378 --> 00:01:30,712
She's all yours.

How much longer,
do you think?

33
00:01:55,804 --> 00:01:57,470
Eh, about an hour.

34
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:59,373
Why don't you put your
head back? Get some rest.

35
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,542
No, you get lost coming home
from the supermarket.

36
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:06,245
If I do that,
we might end up in California.

37
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:08,447
Well, so you wake up
to the sound of the Pacific.

38
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,517
Nothing wrong with that.

39
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:12,319
I'll pick up Judy
on the way.

40
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:14,787
Ah, that actually sounds
so nice, Ed.

41
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:16,425
We should plan on it.

42
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:17,827
Uh-oh.

43
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:20,729
What's this?

44
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:33,810
You folks need to turn around.
Pretty bad accident up ahead.

45
00:02:34,743 --> 00:02:36,843
Uh, anything we can do?

46
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:38,712
You a doctor or something?

47
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:40,250
Or something.

48
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:45,618
He just meant if you need
an extra set of hands.

49
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,886
Yeah.

50
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:48,690
We got it covered. Thanks.

51
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,632
Nice doll.

52
00:02:56,398 --> 00:02:57,633
That's what you think.

53
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,803
All right, you're gonna head
three miles back to the last exit.

54
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:06,005
You'll hop on 26,
that'll loop you around.

55
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:07,874
- 26. Got it.
- Thank you, Officer.

56
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:12,949
A guy and his doll.

57
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:31,530
I think we missed our turn.

58
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:34,034
We didn't miss it.
Bridgewater's just up ahead.

59
00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:35,868
Bridgewater?
Old Ridge Road.

60
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,339
Where did you get
Bridgewater from?

61
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:41,578
Well, you know what?
I think we missed our turn.

62
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:46,279
I'll keep my eye out
for the Pacific.

63
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:49,686
Ed?

64
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,488
- Ed?
- Hang on, hang on.

65
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:05,235
- Come on.
- What just happened?

66
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:08,837
Uh... I'll pop the hood
and find out.

67
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:14,876
Well, be careful.

68
00:04:28,823 --> 00:04:29,925
There we go.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

70
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:49,569
I like your doll.

71
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:13,462
I feel cold.

72
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:29,011
You were
just in an accident.

73
00:06:31,712 --> 00:06:32,881
I was?

74
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:37,954
Sorry. Wires crossed.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

76
00:06:54,703 --> 00:06:55,871
That should do it.

77
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:00,442
Honey, you okay?

78
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Ed!

79
00:07:17,092 --> 00:07:18,094
I'm okay.

80
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm so sorry!
All of a sudden it was like
somebody took over my truck.
I had no control.
Are you okay?

81
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,736
I'm fine.

82
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:32,441
It's the doll, Ed.

83
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:36,179
It's a beacon
for other spirits.

84
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,539
Over here.

85
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:33,061
Father, sooner the better.
Yeah?

86
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:34,596
Yeah.

87
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:50,010
Be not wise
in thine own eyes.

88
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:53,313
Fear the Lord
and depart from evil.

89
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:59,685
The curse of the Lord is
in the house of the wicked.

90
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:03,792
But He blesseth
the habitation of the just.

91
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:07,894
Surely,
He scorneth the scorners,

92
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:12,131
but He giveth grace
unto the lowly.

93
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:15,367
The wise shall inherit
the glory,

94
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:19,609
but shame shall be
the promotion of fools.

95
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,681
Amen.

96
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,234
We need another
barrier of protection.

97
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,235
A holy one.

98
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:49,839
I agree.

99
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:53,175
The blessing
will only do so much.

100
00:10:57,111 --> 00:10:58,178
That chapel glass

101
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,113
we got from Trinity Church
before it was torn down,

102
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:02,183
where is that?

103
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:24,337
"Let us forgive those

104
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:25,939
who trespass against us

105
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:27,942
and lead us
not into temptation,

106
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:29,210
but deliver us from evil."

107
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:30,979
Amen.

108
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:44,426
Did it work?

109
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:53,201
Hmm. The evil is contained.

You're my hero.

131
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:08,133

is on the counter

132
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:09,434
and numbers are by the phone.

133
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:10,469
Perfect.

134
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:11,603
And we'll be back
early tomorrow morning.

135
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:15,040
Well, and take your time,
we'll be fine. Right, Judy?

136
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,976
Yeah.

137
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:19,045
- So, you'll...
- Behave? Yes.

138
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:20,146
And you'll remember
to go to...

139
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:21,280
Remember to go to bed
on time.

140
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:22,982
Absolutely.

141
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:24,549
- All right, don't forget to...
- To have fun.

142
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:25,587
- I know.
- That, too.

143
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:30,256
Did you guys rehearse that,
or what?

144
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,106
Earth to Judy!

145
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:48,244
What's wrong?

146
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:50,008
Nothing.

147
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,112
I'm fine.

148
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:54,948
Well, it's just a couple more
hours until the weekend.

149
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,049
I'm gonna run to the market

150
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:57,116
for supplies
during my free period.

151
00:14:57,118 --> 00:14:58,119
I'll pick you up after, okay?

152
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:02,090
Sounds super.

153
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:08,297
Bye, Judy!

154
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,468
Have a good day!

155
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:14,293
Mrs. Faley,
it's right over here.

156
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:15,297
Let me show you.

157
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:19,098
How could you not tell me

158
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,266
what the Warrens did
for a living?

159
00:16:20,268 --> 00:16:21,767
Shouldn't you be
in math class?

160
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:23,368
Mary Ellen!

161
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,371
I babysat the Smiths
for over two years

162
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:26,572
and never told you
what they did.

163
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:28,141
Oh, what do they do?

164
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:29,541
They're podiatrists.

165
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:31,209
So not the same.

166
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:33,212
Well, obviously,
I'm coming over later.

167
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:34,679
We do have
that social studies project

168
00:16:34,681 --> 00:16:36,348
- that we need to work on.
- Uh...

169
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,784
We don't have any project.

170
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:39,220
Okay, but how would
they know?

171
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,120
She's psychic.

172
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:43,256
Then, they're heroes.

173
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:44,823
I think
they're concerned parents

174
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:46,324
who wouldn't want
negative influences

175
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:47,459
around their child.

176
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,127
What negative influence?

177
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:51,063
'Cause I sometimes
stay out past curfew?

178
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:53,265
Among other things.

179
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:54,767
So, what's it like
inside the house?

180
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:57,235
Is it all creepy music
and cobwebs?

181
00:16:57,237 --> 00:16:58,805
No. No, it's boring suburbia.

182
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:00,476
The inside
of your locker is scarier.

183
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:06,646
Wait. Whose party,
and why wasn't I invited?

184
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:07,813
Judy's birthday is coming up,

185
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:09,682
so we're gonna
celebrate early.

186
00:17:09,684 --> 00:17:12,551
You really are the best
babysitter, you know that?

187
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,654
Compliments will
get you nowhere.

188
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:15,821
What about threats?

189
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:19,125
Did you, uh, happen to notice
who's working checkout?

190
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:21,094
- Have a good one.
- Will do.

191
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:22,494
- Thank you so much.
- See you soon.

192
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:23,628
You wouldn't.

193
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,231
You know what they call him,
right?

194
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,136
- Have a good one.
- What?

195
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:33,473
Bob's-Got-Balls.

196
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:34,607
How you doing?

197
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:35,711
Hi, Daniela.

198
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:44,649
Uh...

199
00:17:44,651 --> 00:17:48,120
- Hi, Mary Ellen.
- Is this everything?

200
00:17:48,122 --> 00:17:50,289
- I think so.
- Oh, cool.

201
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,523
You live near the Warrens,
don't you, Bob?

202
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:52,559
Uh...

203
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:55,627
Yeah, Mary Ellen's babysitting
for them tonight.

204
00:17:55,629 --> 00:17:58,164
Yeah. Yeah, I live
right across the street.

205
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,500
Do you ever see
anything scary over there?

206
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:02,335
Like a ghost, maybe?

207
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:03,569
Bob...

208
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:04,604
Mrs. Faley went ahead

209
00:18:04,606 --> 00:18:07,139
and dropped a can
of tomato sauce in aisle five,

210
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:10,276
and it looks like a crime
scene, so get the mop.

211
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:11,543
Ladies. Did you find
everything okay?

212
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:12,578
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yes, sir.

213
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,680
Bob here is not giving you
any trouble, is he?

214
00:18:14,682 --> 00:18:15,647
- No.
- No.

215
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:16,915
- Yeah, I got it. Thanks, Dad.
- All right.

216
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,717
I'll do it right after.

217
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:20,121
So, what'd you see?

218
00:18:21,222 --> 00:18:23,289
At the Warrens'?

219
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,857
Uh, nothing. Nothing.

220
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:27,460
Um, your total is $3.50, so...

221
00:18:27,462 --> 00:18:28,464
Oh.

222
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:31,597
But you knew
what the Warrens did?

223
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,200
There were rumors,
I guess, but...

224
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:35,800
Rumors. Interesting.

225
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:38,671
Did you know there's a rumor
going around about you, Bob?

226
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:40,940
- Wait, really?
- What is it about?

227
00:18:40,942 --> 00:18:42,508
Uh, it's about a girl
who has a...

228
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,446
Fine. You can come.
Stop.

229
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:48,246
- Oh. Sorry.
- Sorry.

230
00:18:48,248 --> 00:18:50,515
- That's totally my fault.
- It's okay.

231
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,652
Um... So, what...

232
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:53,886
Bye, Bob. Thanks.

233
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:54,889
Bye.

234
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,793
Uh, she forgot her eggs, so...

235
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:00,893
Here.

236
00:19:00,895 --> 00:19:02,397
She likes you.

237
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,903
There's been an accident.

238
00:19:19,414 --> 00:19:20,549
Don't touch her.

239
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:22,882
You'll get obsessed.

240
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:24,817
- It's "possessed."
- That's what I said.

241
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:27,286
Anyways, if you know so much,

242
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:28,154
why don't you tell us

243
00:19:28,156 --> 00:19:29,825
if you can catch cooties
from a ghost?

244
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:31,691
You can't.

245
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:33,392
Well, then how'd you get 'em?

246
00:19:33,394 --> 00:19:34,926
Anthony Rios!

247
00:19:34,928 --> 00:19:36,564
Don't make me
get your sister.

248
00:19:37,398 --> 00:19:38,463
Please don't.

249
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:40,966
Then go. All of you.
Come on.

250
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:43,402
Come on. Let's go!

251
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:45,574
I'm sorry I can't come
to your birthday party, Judy.

252
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:48,808
You can't either?

253
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,475
My parents said
I'm not really prepared

254
00:19:50,477 --> 00:19:51,746
to process death yet.

255
00:19:53,747 --> 00:19:55,447
It's a birthday party.

256
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:56,484
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:09,464 --> 00:20:11,664
Hey, how long
has that been happening?

258
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,769
Since everyone heard about
the article this week.

259
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:16,335
Please don't tell my parents.

260
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:18,937
I won't.
I won't as long as you do.

261
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:20,940
- I don't want them to worry.
- They're parents.

262
00:20:20,942 --> 00:20:22,008
They're worried
about everything

263
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,512
whether they need to be
or not.

264
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,283
Are you sure the bullying is

265
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:32,917
the only thing
that's bothering you?

266
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,419
That isn't bothering me.

267
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:35,723
You know what I mean.

268
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:43,898
And remember our deal.
No secrets.

269
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,299
I know.

270
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:47,502
I don't have any.

271
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:50,672
What did you get
at the store?

272
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:52,771
A surprise.

273
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:55,674
- You said no secrets.
- A surprise isn't a secret.

274
00:20:55,676 --> 00:20:58,847
- What is it then?
- It's a surprise.

275
00:21:01,448 --> 00:21:06,751
<i>♪ I remember
Finding out about you ♪</i>

276
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:16,631
You're gonna make a mess.

277
00:21:21,502 --> 00:21:23,001
Hey! Save some for the cake.

278
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:24,406
No.

279
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:33,514
I think
there's someone at the door.

280
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:49,361
I was knocking on the door
for, like, ten minutes.

281
00:21:49,363 --> 00:21:51,496
How did you even get in?

282
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:53,699
Back door.
Is this a spirit bell?

283
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:55,367
What's a spirit bell?

284
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:57,802
It tells you if you're in
the presence of any spirits.

285
00:21:57,804 --> 00:21:59,605
- So, it is one.
- No.

286
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:02,007
It's just a bell.
My mom collects them.

287
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:03,545
Oh.

288
00:22:04,044 --> 00:22:05,543
Who are you?

289
00:22:05,545 --> 00:22:08,614
She's Daniela,
and she leaves after cake.

290
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:09,949
Oh, good!

291
00:22:09,951 --> 00:22:11,086
I love cake.

292
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:14,552
So, Judy.

293
00:22:14,554 --> 00:22:18,626
Don't your parents, like, keep
any creepy stuff around?

294
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:21,894
No.

295
00:22:21,896 --> 00:22:24,332
They keep it all locked away
in a room.

296
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,800
Well, can we at least
go in and look?

297
00:22:28,802 --> 00:22:29,937
No!

298
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:33,875
It's not really good
for anyone to go in there.

299
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:35,710
How come?

300
00:22:36,711 --> 00:22:38,080
Just isn't.

301
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:40,648
Wait.

302
00:22:42,015 --> 00:22:43,549
Here.

303
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:44,552
Birthday present.

304
00:22:48,488 --> 00:22:49,722
What is it?

305
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:50,891
Look inside.

306
00:22:58,064 --> 00:22:59,665
How did you
even afford those?

307
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:00,799
They're my old ones.

308
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:02,667
But I only ever used them once
'cause I broke my arm

309
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:04,669
the first time I put them on.

310
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:05,805
You're kidding.

311
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:08,706
She looks
way more coordinated.

312
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,142
They're gonna ruin the floors.

313
00:23:10,144 --> 00:23:12,478
Can we go around
the block, then?

314
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,180
- I don't think...
- Good idea.

315
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:15,280
You guys go.

316
00:23:15,282 --> 00:23:17,386
I'll watch the cake
and make sure it doesn't burn.

317
00:23:18,886 --> 00:23:21,587
Fine. But don't snoop.
Don't touch.

318
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:23,521
Don't do anything. Please?

319
00:23:23,523 --> 00:23:25,494
Stay in the kitchen.
Promise me.

320
00:23:25,993 --> 00:23:27,162
I promise.

321
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:08,901
Fuck it.

322
00:24:08,903 --> 00:24:11,740
I am calling out to the
spirits on the other side.

323
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:14,976
Please unlock this door
and let me in.

324
00:24:29,623 --> 00:24:30,791
Shit.

325
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:57,711
Please don't judge me.

326
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:02,716
Amen.

327
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:23,071
Whoa.

328
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:34,815
Whoa.

329
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:54,995
What'd you do
to get in there?

330
00:29:57,484 --> 00:30:00,021
If there is a presence here
in this room,

331
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,924
please give me a sign.

332
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:09,129
Any sign at all.

333
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:15,969
Dad?

334
00:30:28,882 --> 00:30:29,883
This is stupid.

335
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:12,552
Shit.

336
00:32:46,285 --> 00:32:48,220
You burnt the cake? Daniela.

337
00:32:48,222 --> 00:32:49,754
Only the top.

338
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:52,089
Just put frosting on it.

339
00:32:52,091 --> 00:32:53,558
She'll never know.

340
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,592
How'd it go with the skates?

341
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:56,228
She loved them until she fell
on the way back

342
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,695
and skinned her knee.

343
00:32:57,697 --> 00:32:59,263
Better than breaking her arm.

344
00:32:59,265 --> 00:33:00,464
Where is she anyway?

345
00:33:00,466 --> 00:33:02,634
She's out
feeding the chickens.

346
00:33:02,636 --> 00:33:04,469
They have chickens?

347
00:33:08,408 --> 00:33:09,676
Hey. How's your knee?

348
00:33:10,276 --> 00:33:11,443
Oh.

349
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:14,613
Looks like your jeans will
at least need some stitches.

350
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:15,746
It's okay.

351
00:33:15,748 --> 00:33:17,184
Accidents happen.

352
00:33:21,754 --> 00:33:23,224
So, are you scared yet?

353
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,258
Scared? What? No.

354
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,059
Who says they're scared?

355
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:30,127
Kids in my class.

356
00:33:30,129 --> 00:33:31,829
Anthony Rios started it.

357
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:33,165
I hate him.

358
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,570
Wait. Tony Rios started it?

359
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:38,039
Do you know him?

360
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:41,373
Yeah, he's my brother.

361
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:44,475
Anthony Rios is your brother?

362
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:46,744
Yeah, I know.
Don't hold it against me.

363
00:33:46,746 --> 00:33:49,213
I don't like him either.

364
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:51,119
You know,
he still wets the bed.

365
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:53,585
You didn't hear it from me.

366
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:55,289
Or maybe you did,
I don't care.

367
00:33:55,855 --> 00:33:57,521
Still, just...

368
00:33:57,523 --> 00:33:59,226
go a little easy on him.

369
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,230
It's been a tough year.

370
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:08,101
You lost somebody,
didn't you?

371
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,371
My dad. Uh...

372
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:14,108
Did Mary Ellen tell you?

373
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:16,511
No.

374
00:34:17,377 --> 00:34:18,612
I just knew.

375
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:22,880
Um, for delivery.

376
00:34:22,882 --> 00:34:25,717
Could I do one large, please?

377
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:29,190
Um, it's gonna be
3506 Wayman Street.

378
00:34:30,357 --> 00:34:32,092
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

379
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:37,895
Coming.

380
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,835
Hold your horses.

381
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:52,612
Who is it?

382
00:34:58,451 --> 00:34:59,786
Hello?

383
00:35:01,455 --> 00:35:02,790
Daniela?

384
00:35:11,397 --> 00:35:12,833
Is Annabelle there?

385
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:22,373
Who?

386
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:24,511
Can Annabelle
come out to play?

387
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:39,858
I think you have
the wrong house.

388
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,562
There's no Annabelle here.

389
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,797
Yes, she is.

390
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:47,835
She's right behind you.

391
00:35:58,779 --> 00:36:01,645
People are just...
They're really weird about death.

392
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:03,915
That's probably why the kids
pick on you at school.

393
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:05,817
It scares them.

394
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:08,286
They treat it like it's some
disease they don't wanna get,

395
00:36:08,288 --> 00:36:10,157
even though
everyone already has it.

396
00:36:11,225 --> 00:36:13,224
But here's the thing.

397
00:36:13,226 --> 00:36:14,893
I used to think
it was fatal and whammo.

398
00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:16,228
It's, like, out.

399
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,395
Like turning off a TV.

400
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:19,697
Then I learned
about your parents

401
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:20,799
and their whole exploration

402
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:22,569
into the afterlife
and stuff...

403
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:26,373
and they gave me hope.

404
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:30,877
That maybe
life goes on somehow.

405
00:36:32,612 --> 00:36:33,614
Maybe...

406
00:36:34,614 --> 00:36:38,386
my darling dad
is still out there somewhere.

407
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:40,819
"Darling dad"?

408
00:36:40,821 --> 00:36:42,621
It was a thing.

409
00:36:42,623 --> 00:36:45,626
He was darling dad,
and I was darling Daniela...

410
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:47,795
Stupid.

411
00:36:49,462 --> 00:36:51,231
He's still out there,
you know.

412
00:36:52,398 --> 00:36:53,998
You think so?

413
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,936
My parents
would say he is, too.

414
00:37:16,623 --> 00:37:18,322
Where are you going?

415
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:19,694
Be right back.

416
00:37:31,804 --> 00:37:32,973
Dad?

417
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:51,458
Daniela?

418
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:03,000
Daniela!

419
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:06,003
Where did she go?

420
00:38:06,005 --> 00:38:07,005
What are you doing?

421
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:09,510
Daniela, you're not supposed
to go down there!

422
00:38:11,645 --> 00:38:14,014
- What are you doing?
- I thought I saw something.

423
00:38:17,016 --> 00:38:18,285
What did you see?

424
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:23,420
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

425
00:40:55,174 --> 00:40:56,176
Judy?

426
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:06,119
Judy?

427
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,092
Judy?

428
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,634
Judy?

429
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:27,672
In thee, O Lord,
do I put my trust.

430
00:41:27,674 --> 00:41:29,273
Let me never be
put to confusion.

431
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:31,074
Deliver me into
Thy righteousness

432
00:41:31,076 --> 00:41:32,744
and cause me to escape.
Incline Thine ear...

433
00:41:32,746 --> 00:41:34,612
Hey! Hey, Judy! Judy.

434
00:41:34,614 --> 00:41:36,050
What's going on? What's wrong?

435
00:41:38,018 --> 00:41:39,552
What's going on?

436
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:44,191
What happened?

437
00:41:45,324 --> 00:41:46,493
Nothing.

438
00:41:46,826 --> 00:41:47,962
Judy...

439
00:41:50,263 --> 00:41:52,063
I just got scared.

440
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:53,967
Scared of what?

441
00:41:57,804 --> 00:41:59,106
Sometimes...

442
00:42:00,105 --> 00:42:01,806
I see things.

443
00:42:01,808 --> 00:42:03,811
Like how my mom sees things.

444
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:10,551
You mean like ghosts?

445
00:42:15,355 --> 00:42:17,157
Where do you see them?

446
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:20,761
Everywhere I go.

447
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,168
Judy...

448
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:32,203
Ghosts used to be people.

449
00:42:32,205 --> 00:42:34,842
And not every person
you meet is bad...

450
00:42:36,342 --> 00:42:39,679
so maybe not all ghosts
are bad, either.

451
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:50,891
Daniela.

452
00:42:52,025 --> 00:42:53,958
- You have to see this.
- What?

453
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,194
It's this case the Warrens
investigated about this girl

454
00:42:56,196 --> 00:42:58,262
who was terrorized by
something called the Ferryman.

455
00:42:58,264 --> 00:43:00,098
Here's a picture
of the girl he killed.

456
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,366
Look familiar?

457
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:03,203
I mean,
you two could be sisters.

458
00:43:06,272 --> 00:43:09,275
Here's the rest of the file,
if you want to take a look.

459
00:43:17,049 --> 00:43:18,351
Look at all this stuff.

460
00:43:24,257 --> 00:43:26,190
How cool.

461
00:43:26,192 --> 00:43:28,860
Okay, this is the file
on the Black Shuck.

462
00:43:28,862 --> 00:43:29,895
The Black Shuck?

463
00:43:29,897 --> 00:43:31,829
It was a case
the Warrens investigated

464
00:43:31,831 --> 00:43:34,068
about a hellhound that
possessed a man in England.

465
00:43:35,701 --> 00:43:37,370
He terrorized the shit
out of this town.

466
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:49,249
What's with the coins
over their eyes?

467
00:43:50,382 --> 00:43:51,384
What?

468
00:43:53,118 --> 00:43:54,451
Oh, I don't know.
I didn't get that far.

469
00:43:54,453 --> 00:43:56,820
They used to put them
over the eyes of the dead

470
00:43:56,822 --> 00:43:57,889
to pay the Ferryman,
so he could

471
00:43:57,891 --> 00:43:59,824
take their souls
to the underworld.

472
00:43:59,826 --> 00:44:01,192
It was his toll.

473
00:44:01,194 --> 00:44:03,261
Okay, we should go.

474
00:44:03,263 --> 00:44:05,962
It's okay. I sometimes
like to snoop, too.

475
00:44:05,964 --> 00:44:08,398
Do you know
what this does, Judy?

476
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,703
I think it's called
a Mourner's Bracelet.

477
00:44:13,072 --> 00:44:16,176
It helps you contact
your lost loved ones.

478
00:44:24,717 --> 00:44:26,416
- What's that?
- Um...

479
00:44:26,418 --> 00:44:29,056
It's a case my parents
investigated recently.

480
00:44:29,922 --> 00:44:31,355
The wedding dress.

481
00:44:31,357 --> 00:44:32,960
It haunts people.

482
00:44:34,027 --> 00:44:36,830
And it makes them violent.

483
00:44:38,464 --> 00:44:39,996
Where is the dress now?

484
00:44:39,998 --> 00:44:41,301
Down the hall
in the artifact room.

485
00:44:44,804 --> 00:44:47,441
I mean, that's where
all this stuff is.

486
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,974
Right, Judy?

487
00:44:48,976 --> 00:44:51,211
- That's what you said earlier.
- Oh, um...

488
00:44:51,478 --> 00:44:52,809
Yeah.

489
00:44:52,811 --> 00:44:55,045
My dad says
that everything in there

490
00:44:55,047 --> 00:44:58,449
is either haunted, cursed,

491
00:44:58,451 --> 00:45:01,886
or used in some
ritualistic practice.

492
00:45:01,888 --> 00:45:03,320
What about the doll
that's in there?

493
00:45:03,322 --> 00:45:04,755
Because I read this interview
with your dad...

494
00:45:04,757 --> 00:45:05,759
No.

495
00:45:08,127 --> 00:45:09,763
Don't talk about her.

496
00:45:12,965 --> 00:45:13,967
Why not?

497
00:45:18,203 --> 00:45:20,406
She's in a case for a reason.

498
00:45:21,808 --> 00:45:23,474
Okay, we should go.

499
00:45:23,476 --> 00:45:24,541
I wonder what's on this.

500
00:45:24,543 --> 00:45:26,277
No, Daniela! Wait!

501
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:30,848
<i>I command you,
unclean spirit,</i>

502
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,483
<i>along with all your minions...</i>

503
00:45:32,485 --> 00:45:34,085
<i>I command you</i>

504
00:45:34,087 --> 00:45:36,156
<i>to obey me to the letter!</i>

505
00:45:40,793 --> 00:45:43,828
Okay, show's over.
Let's go do something else.

506
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,864
Do something that's
actually appropriate.

507
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:47,898
Come on,

508
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,770
don't you at least wanna hear
about the samurai?

509
00:45:56,308 --> 00:45:57,808
What about this one?

510
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,509
I don't remember that one.

511
00:45:59,511 --> 00:46:00,780
How do you play?

512
00:46:01,313 --> 00:46:03,183
Let's find out.

513
00:46:10,022 --> 00:46:12,190
Okay. Okay,
so you draw a card

514
00:46:12,192 --> 00:46:13,491
and whatever picture
it has on it

515
00:46:13,493 --> 00:46:14,826
is the object you try to find

516
00:46:14,828 --> 00:46:16,494
by feeling around
inside the box.

517
00:46:16,496 --> 00:46:18,429
If the object you pull out
matches the picture,

518
00:46:18,431 --> 00:46:19,433
then you get a point.

519
00:46:22,335 --> 00:46:23,835
You go first.

520
00:46:23,837 --> 00:46:24,905
Okay.

521
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,306
You gonna get that?

522
00:47:00,473 --> 00:47:02,105
Yeah.

523
00:47:02,107 --> 00:47:04,208
Sorry, you guys keep playing.

524
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:05,244
Oh, got a point.

525
00:47:07,112 --> 00:47:08,114
Nice.

526
00:47:30,469 --> 00:47:31,605
Hello?

527
00:47:49,656 --> 00:47:50,891
Hi, Mary Ellen.

528
00:47:51,491 --> 00:47:53,157
Hi.

529
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:54,692
Remember how, at the store,

530
00:47:54,694 --> 00:47:56,626
Daniela said that
you were babysitting here?

531
00:47:56,628 --> 00:47:57,929
Yeah. Yeah.

532
00:47:57,931 --> 00:47:58,965
Me, too.

533
00:47:59,665 --> 00:48:01,601
Anyways, that's why I'm here.

534
00:48:02,101 --> 00:48:03,134
Oh.

535
00:48:03,136 --> 00:48:07,704
Bob, they don't really want me
having boys over.

536
00:48:07,706 --> 00:48:10,174
No, that's not what I meant.
I don't wanna come in.

537
00:48:10,176 --> 00:48:11,541
I just, uh...

538
00:48:11,543 --> 00:48:12,610
I mean, I would, but...

539
00:48:12,612 --> 00:48:14,581
Well...

540
00:48:15,614 --> 00:48:18,648
I just knew you were
gonna be here,

541
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,953
and I just wanted to come by
and talk to you

542
00:48:21,955 --> 00:48:23,621
without my stupid dad
or somebody interrupting.

543
00:48:23,623 --> 00:48:25,588
Bob's-Got-Balls!

544
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,994
Nice.

545
00:48:28,728 --> 00:48:30,230
You two sharing some pizza?

546
00:48:32,197 --> 00:48:34,134
- I should get the money.
- Yeah.

547
00:48:36,235 --> 00:48:38,268
Are you two, like...

548
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:40,438
I... I wish.

549
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,409
You know you need to, like,
woo her, right?

550
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,277
- Woo her?
- Yeah.

551
00:48:46,279 --> 00:48:50,480
Guys like Mary Ellen,
they need to be wooed.

552
00:48:50,482 --> 00:48:52,616
You mean
girls like Mary Ellen.

553
00:48:52,618 --> 00:48:54,050
What did I say?

554
00:48:54,052 --> 00:48:55,152
Guys.

555
00:48:56,456 --> 00:48:58,322
So, how do I woo her?

556
00:48:58,324 --> 00:49:00,991
There's only one way to woo.

557
00:49:00,993 --> 00:49:02,261
It's obvious.

558
00:49:02,728 --> 00:49:04,397
Rock and roll.

559
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:09,065
Here. Keep it.

560
00:49:09,067 --> 00:49:10,000
Sweet.

561
00:49:10,002 --> 00:49:12,636
Thanks, and that means
you can keep this.

562
00:49:12,638 --> 00:49:15,473
Minus one slice.

563
00:49:15,475 --> 00:49:17,641
I enjoyed that in the car.

564
00:49:17,643 --> 00:49:19,012
See you later, Balls.

565
00:49:20,112 --> 00:49:22,512
I would invite you in,
but like I said...

566
00:49:22,514 --> 00:49:24,148
No, yeah, it's cool.

567
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,653
I thought I'd just stop by
and say hi, I guess, so...

568
00:49:27,652 --> 00:49:29,121
I'm glad you did.

569
00:49:29,755 --> 00:49:31,123
Me, too.

570
00:49:34,192 --> 00:49:36,594
Hey, Bob, um...

571
00:49:36,596 --> 00:49:38,264
How come they call you that?

572
00:49:39,665 --> 00:49:41,098
Um...

573
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,099
Well, you know how
I'm the equipments manager

574
00:49:43,101 --> 00:49:44,136
for the basketball team?

575
00:49:45,038 --> 00:49:46,204
- Yeah.
- That's why.

576
00:49:46,206 --> 00:49:49,239
There's not really, like,
a story or anything behind it.

577
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:50,574
Just like,
"Hey, I need balls."

578
00:49:50,576 --> 00:49:53,244
I'm, like,
"I got it. Balls. Got 'em."

579
00:49:56,748 --> 00:49:58,315
I'll see woo later.

580
00:49:58,317 --> 00:49:59,650
You. You. I'll see you later.

581
00:49:59,652 --> 00:50:01,253
I'm gonna go.

582
00:50:02,355 --> 00:50:03,520
Bye, Bob.

583
00:50:03,522 --> 00:50:04,623
Bye.

584
00:50:16,069 --> 00:50:17,268

Bob?

642
00:54:34,592 --> 00:54:35,525
He left.

643
00:54:35,527 --> 00:54:38,362
Hmm, hopefully he went home
to practice.

644
00:54:38,364 --> 00:54:39,996
Okay. Back up to bed.

645
00:54:39,998 --> 00:54:41,433
- Daniela.
- Yeah, yeah.

646
00:54:48,107 --> 00:54:49,706
I'd feel better
if you let me stay.

647
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:50,840
I can wake up early.

648
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:52,375
We don't even
have to tell Judy.

649
00:54:52,377 --> 00:54:53,576
No. No, it's fine.

650
00:54:53,578 --> 00:54:54,580
Go home.

651
00:54:55,714 --> 00:54:56,913
But...

652
00:54:56,915 --> 00:54:58,715
But what?

653
00:54:58,717 --> 00:55:00,116
Thank you for coming.

654
00:55:00,118 --> 00:55:02,920
I actually think
it helped Judy a lot.

655
00:55:02,922 --> 00:55:04,420
Sorry you didn't get to see
any cobwebs

656
00:55:04,422 --> 00:55:05,521
or hear any creepy music.

657
00:55:05,523 --> 00:55:07,891
Well, the Bob thing
was kind of creepy, at least.

658
00:55:09,027 --> 00:55:11,862
But if Bob comes knocking
on this door late at night,

659
00:55:11,864 --> 00:55:13,996
forget you're you for a minute
and let him in.

660
00:55:16,701 --> 00:55:18,638
Call me tomorrow
and tell me the details.

661
00:55:19,638 --> 00:55:21,040
There will be
no details to tell.

662
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:47,533
Shit.

663
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:13,719
How'd her dad die?

664
00:57:15,487 --> 00:57:17,956
I don't know if that's
the best bedtime story.

665
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:20,924
Look who my parents are.

666
00:57:20,926 --> 00:57:22,161
I'm used to it.

667
00:57:23,661 --> 00:57:24,761
Well,

668
00:57:24,763 --> 00:57:28,898
the short of it is that
he died in a car accident.

669
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,571
And the long of it is that...

670
00:57:32,203 --> 00:57:34,173
Daniela was driving.

671
00:57:35,574 --> 00:57:37,174
Was it her fault?

672
00:57:37,176 --> 00:57:38,708
No.

673
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:39,909
There's only one person

674
00:57:39,911 --> 00:57:41,814
who actually thinks
it was her fault.

675
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000

676
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,862
Okay.

00:59:36,661 --> 00:59:38,130
Let's try this again.

678
00:59:41,366 --> 00:59:43,300

a presence here...

679
01:00:22,674 --> 01:00:23,676

725
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:11,935
<i>I woke up to a noise.</i>

726
01:09:11,937 --> 01:09:13,906
<i>Another coin being dropped.</i>

727
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:18,841
<i>It was like he was...</i>

728
01:09:18,843 --> 01:09:22,211
<i>Like he was calling me.</i>

729
01:09:22,213 --> 01:09:23,781
<i>Have you ever seen
the Ferryman?</i>

730
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:28,350
<i>If you don't pay his toll,</i>

731
01:09:28,352 --> 01:09:29,586

- Oh, thank God. Mrs. Warren?

752
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:15,451
<i>Is everything okay?
What's going on?</i>

753
01:17:15,453 --> 01:17:17,452
Judy's fine. Um...

754
01:17:17,454 --> 01:17:20,288
Something is happening
inside your house

755
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:21,823
and I don't think
it's safe to go outside.

756
01:17:21,825 --> 01:17:23,628
We're not really sure
what to do.

757
01:17:25,029 --> 01:17:27,031
<i>Can I speak to Annabelle?</i>

758
01:17:31,102 --> 01:17:32,400
I'm sorry?

759
01:17:32,402 --> 01:17:34,772
<i>You need to give her
a soul, dear.</i>

760
01:17:36,941 --> 01:17:40,076
- What?
- <i>A soul. She wants her soul.</i>

761
01:17:41,245 --> 01:17:43,179
<i>Give me her soul.</i>

762
01:19:17,909 --> 01:19:19,809
Wait! Don't!

763
01:19:19,811 --> 01:19:21,377
I'm so sorry.

764
01:19:21,379 --> 01:19:22,912
What are you doing here?

765
01:19:43,267 --> 01:19:44,600
Annabelle.

766
01:19:44,602 --> 01:19:47,372
The doll. She's the one
who's doing all of this.

767
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:50,005
A doll?

768
01:19:50,007 --> 01:19:52,777
She wants a soul.

769
01:19:59,517 --> 01:20:02,120
I just wanted
to see him again.

770
01:20:04,387 --> 01:20:07,223
What did you do?

771
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:09,861
I wanted to tell him
I'm sorry.

772
01:20:10,628 --> 01:20:12,831
I know it was my fault.

773
01:20:13,496 --> 01:20:14,999
Daniela...

774
01:20:15,633 --> 01:20:17,068
what did you do?

775
01:20:20,204 --> 01:20:21,973
I let her out.

776
01:20:22,906 --> 01:20:25,075
What else did you touch?

777
01:20:28,913 --> 01:20:30,214
Everything.

778
01:20:37,221 --> 01:20:39,456

Mary Ellen!

780
01:20:48,566 --> 01:20:51,166
It's her asthma.
She's having an attack.

781
01:20:51,168 --> 01:20:52,504
The inhaler's in her car.

782
01:20:53,204 --> 01:20:54,438
I'll go get it.

783
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:57,508
No! Let me!

Mary Ellen!

789
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:54,292
Here.

790
01:22:56,494 --> 01:22:57,629
Are you okay?

791
01:23:03,467 --> 01:23:06,769
Where's Daniela?
She came after you.

792
01:23:06,771 --> 01:23:08,103
Mary Ellen?

793
01:23:08,105 --> 01:23:10,204
Judy? I'm up here.

794
01:23:10,206 --> 01:23:12,610
No. That's not Daniela.

795
01:23:14,145 --> 01:23:15,746
Something has a hold of her.
I can feel it.

796
01:23:21,485 --> 01:23:22,618
What do we do?

797
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:24,189
We have to find Annabelle.

798
01:23:25,222 --> 01:23:27,025
We have to put her back
in the case.

799
01:23:27,657 --> 01:23:29,259
Do you know where she is?

800
01:23:32,195 --> 01:23:33,197
No.

801
01:24:01,157 --> 01:24:02,526
Wait, wait, Judy, don't.

802
01:24:08,865 --> 01:24:10,701
Not all ghosts are bad.

803
01:24:12,203 --> 01:24:13,204
Right?

804
01:24:32,188 --> 01:24:33,624
Not all ghosts are bad.

01:25:35,585 --> 01:25:37,121
What did you say?

809
01:25:37,687 --> 01:25:39,190
Come on, let's go.

810
01:26:04,949 --> 01:26:06,384
Come on.

811
01:26:21,397 --> 01:26:22,534
I'll get her.

812
01:26:28,638 --> 01:26:31,208
No, no, no.
No! Just stop!

813
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:34,743
Where do your parents
keep the key?

814
01:26:34,745 --> 01:26:36,181
I don't know.
It's never locked.

815
01:27:00,937 --> 01:27:02,206
I know where the key is.

816
01:27:07,645 --> 01:27:09,547
- I'll get it.
- No! No, don't.

817
01:27:10,847 --> 01:27:12,216
I'll do it.

818
01:27:26,829 --> 01:27:27,831
Judy!

819
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:30,802
I got it.

Oh, my God.

822

Give us this day
our daily bread,

823
01:30:09,092 --> 01:30:10,125
and forgive us
for our trespasses

824

- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah. We're okay.

- Are you okay?
- No!

865
01:33:43,072 --> 01:33:44,709
There was a werewolf outside!

866
01:33:45,307 --> 01:33:46,944
You saw the werewolf?

867
01:33:47,777 --> 01:33:49,243
Yeah.

868
01:33:49,245 --> 01:33:50,947
He saved me from it.

869
01:33:53,249 --> 01:33:54,250
You did?

01:33:56,786 --> 01:33:58,353
Yeah. Yeah.

871
01:33:58,355 --> 01:33:59,953
Kind of.

872
01:33:59,955 --> 01:34:01,993
Maybe we should talk
about this somewhere else.

Shit! You're not supposed
to have boys over.

879
01:34:38,995 --> 01:34:41,061
I think that's the least of
our concerns right now, Bob.

880
01:34:41,063 --> 01:34:42,896
Yeah, yeah. I should
probably still get going.

881
01:34:42,898 --> 01:34:44,998
Hey, listen, um,
so Homecoming is coming up

882
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,835
- and I would really like...
- Yes. I'll... I'll go.

883
01:34:46,837 --> 01:34:47,769
With me?

884
01:34:47,771 --> 01:34:49,903
Yes, if the Warrens
don't kill me first.

885
01:34:51,842 --> 01:34:53,140
We tell them everything.

886
01:34:57,947 --> 01:34:58,980
Mom!

887
01:34:58,982 --> 01:35:01,515
Judy! What are you
doing up so early?

888
01:35:01,517 --> 01:35:03,283
Don't get mad...

889
01:35:03,285 --> 01:35:05,255
What happened
to your car?

890
01:35:10,293 --> 01:35:11,926
Here we go.

891
01:35:11,928 --> 01:35:13,698
We'll have
our own party, huh?

892
01:35:20,402 --> 01:35:23,139
- What?
- Can you please take that off?

893
01:35:30,914 --> 01:35:33,782
It won't always be like this,
I promise.

894
01:35:33,784 --> 01:35:35,315
You know,
and sooner or later,

895
01:35:35,317 --> 01:35:37,484
you'll find people
who understand.

896
01:35:37,486 --> 01:35:39,887
And as for young Anthony,

897
01:35:39,889 --> 01:35:41,859
he better hope I don't
run into him anytime soon.

898
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:43,925
Ed.

899
01:35:57,072 --> 01:35:58,174
Happy birthday, Judy.

900
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:00,377
Thank you.

01:36:01,076 --> 01:36:02,112
Happy birthday.

902
01:36:05,382 --> 01:36:08,852
I, uh, had a little talk
with my brother.

903
01:36:09,151 --> 01:36:10,518
Thanks.

904
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,287
Come in.

905
01:36:12,289 --> 01:36:14,792
Is it okay
if my boyfriend joins?

906
01:36:15,525 --> 01:36:16,460
Sure.

907
01:36:18,328 --> 01:36:19,293
Um...

908
01:36:19,295 --> 01:36:22,031
- Hi, uh, thanks for having us.
- Hey.

909
01:36:22,898 --> 01:36:24,232
Bob's-Got-Balls.

910
01:36:24,234 --> 01:36:25,899
No kidding.

911
01:36:25,901 --> 01:36:28,036
- Hi, Judy!
- Happy birthday, Judy!

912
01:36:28,038 --> 01:36:29,604
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

913
01:36:29,606 --> 01:36:32,340
- Hello, Judy, happy birthday.
- Hey, guys, welcome.

914
01:36:32,342 --> 01:36:34,141
Keep comin'.

915
01:36:34,143 --> 01:36:35,609
Happy birthday, Judy.

916
01:36:35,611 --> 01:36:37,147
- Anthony?
- I'm really sorry.

917
01:36:38,013 --> 01:36:39,984
Am I still invited?

918
01:36:41,484 --> 01:36:42,520
Sure.

919
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:49,392
Daniela?

920
01:36:50,427 --> 01:36:52,226
I have something for you.

921
01:36:52,228 --> 01:36:53,429
For me?

922
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:07,242
You found out the hard way

923
01:37:07,244 --> 01:37:10,644
that there is a lot of evil
in this room.

924
01:37:10,646 --> 01:37:13,049
But you know
what I actually like about it?

925
01:37:15,317 --> 01:37:18,088
All the evil in here...

926
01:37:19,356 --> 01:37:22,893
reminds me of all the good
that's out there.

927
01:37:38,941 --> 01:37:40,543
Darling Daniela.

928
01:37:45,981 --> 01:37:47,649
Did Judy tell you that?

929
01:37:47,651 --> 01:37:49,954
No. Your dad did.

930
01:37:54,557 --> 01:37:57,928
He also tells me
that he misses you.

931
01:38:00,195 --> 01:38:03,331
And to stop being
so hard on yourself,

932
01:38:03,333 --> 01:38:05,565
'cause it was
not your fault.

933
01:38:15,611 --> 01:38:17,280
Thank you.

934
01:38:19,148 --> 01:38:20,614
Um...

935
01:38:20,616 --> 01:38:21,683
I'm sorry.

936
01:38:21,685 --> 01:38:23,051
Oh.

937
01:38:23,053 --> 01:38:24,351
It's okay.

938
01:38:24,353 --> 01:38:25,623
You're young.

939
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,527
You know,
when I was about your age,

940
01:38:32,529 --> 01:38:35,697
I once ran off with
a boyfriend for three days

941
01:38:35,699 --> 01:38:37,534
without telling my parents.

942
01:38:40,402 --> 01:38:42,403
I unleashed a demon.

943
01:38:42,405 --> 01:38:44,008
So not the same thing.

944
01:38:44,975 --> 01:38:46,977
Well, okay. True.

945
01:38:53,182 --> 01:38:55,451
Does Mr. Warren know
about this boyfriend?

946
01:38:56,386 --> 01:38:58,022
He was the boyfriend.

947
01:39:02,525 --> 01:39:04,391
Anybody wanna
hear a song? Whoa!

948
01:39:04,393 --> 01:39:06,396
Yeah!

949
01:39:08,298 --> 01:39:10,200
All right, okay.
