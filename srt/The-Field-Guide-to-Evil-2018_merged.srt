1
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:54,354
Kathi, that's enough.

2
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,010
Give it to me.

3
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:30,955
Hey, look.

4
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,566
She's not with child.

5
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:07,617
Kathi!

6
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:15,582
It's a sin.

7
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:21,501
If you sin,
the Trud is summoned.

8
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:25,679
Come along.

9
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:33,251
Now pray.

10
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:41,042
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost,
amen.

11
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:44,785
Our Father,
who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

12
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:50,693
Come.

13
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:10,582
Come in.

14
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:15,762
Stop.

15
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,459
Come on!

16
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:45,182
Do you feel it
already?

17
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:48,925
It's still
much too early.

18
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

19
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:38,187
You barred the door?

20
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,191
What's wrong?

21
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,023
What is it, Kathi?

22
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,287
I'm so scared.

23
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:57,206
Something heavy
was crushing me.

24
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:05,693
Help me.

25
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,612
What have you done?

26
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:20,099
'Tis your guilt
that lures the Trud.

27
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,666
Out with it.
What have you done?

28
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:29,456
You'll bring misfortune
on us all.

29
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:33,112
The goat
is on your conscience.

30
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,898
Pray.
There's nothing else for it.

31
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

32
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

33
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,253
Come, now.

34
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:30,251
No. I don't like her style...

35
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:34,385
You wear too much jewelry.
They must be heavy.

36
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:40,914
But I'm so strong!

37
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:43,612
- Excuse me?
You're "so strong"?
- Yup.

38
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:46,572
Dear girl, okay, before I joined the program today,

39
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,312
I had heard so much about you.

40
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:52,491
People are curious about you.

41
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,102
People are asking: Is this girl for real? Or is she just acting?

42
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:01,021
Yup.

43
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:04,198
I think you're acting. I mean, this is not the real you.

44
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:06,548
I dance too, if that's what you're asking.

45
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:09,725
Do you have siblings?

46
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:13,729
I do. I have an elder and a younger.

47
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,690
So you are the middle one.

48
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,343
And you are also the problem child at home, I presume?

49
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:23,739
Uh, I'm the favorite child.

50
00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:28,004
You are? But parents love all their children the same.

51
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:30,529
My grandmother also loves me the most.

52
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

53
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:59,520
Hello.
What's up?

54
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,003
Mmm...

55
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:06,919
Good.
When do you return?

56
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:12,402
I'm afraid.
I told you.

57
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,456
Okay, forget it.

58
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:24,039
No! No, don't!

59
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:05,907
Okay, you wait.

60
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

61
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:25,949
Okay.
Okay, Mommy is here.

62
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:32,130
Ah!

63
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:44,419
No.

64
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,904
-No. No.

65
00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:04,499
You shall become wise...

66
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:09,069
learn all
the secrets of men...

67
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:14,248
and win all wars...

68
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,947
once you consume
three hearts...

69
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:23,213
of the freshly deceased.

70
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:25,565
I can...

71
00:46:28,263 --> 00:46:31,353
present the emperor
with a drum made of her skin.

72
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,096
As soon as the drum
resounds in battle,

73
00:46:36,097 --> 00:46:38,056
he shall be unconquered.

74
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:40,047
Hey, dude.

75
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:42,310
- Hey.
-What are you drawing?

76
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,704
A masterpiece.

77
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:48,447
Hey, are you gonna
buy Mommy a house one day?

78
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,579
I'm gonna buy Mama a truck.

79
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:54,018
-Oh, you know what Mommy needs?

80
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:56,324
A Cabernet.

81
00:48:56,368 --> 00:48:58,239
We'll be there soon, babe.

82
00:48:58,283 --> 00:48:59,762
You've been saying that.

83
00:49:12,862 --> 00:49:14,429
Okay.
Come on, kiddo.

84
00:49:40,455 --> 00:49:42,718
Arnold!
Come on, bud.

85
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:53,991
Can I play outside?

86
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:55,514
Yeah, bud.
Of course.

87
00:49:56,515 --> 00:49:58,952
You wanna
go with him?Yeah.

88
00:49:59,953 --> 00:50:02,738
Oh!
Oh, nice swing!

89
00:50:02,782 --> 00:50:05,045
Ready?

90
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:07,265
Now, try and hit this,
okay?

91
00:50:07,308 --> 00:50:08,527
Ready?

92
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:14,968
Hello? This is Macie.

93
00:50:58,316 --> 00:51:00,405
I'll play with you,
Arnold.

94
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:04,887
Who are you?

95
00:51:04,931 --> 00:51:06,585
My name is William.

96
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:09,022
Why are you hiding?

97
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,372
I'm good at hiding.

98
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:14,027
Do you wanna play
in the woods with me?

99
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,073
My mom will be mad.

100
00:51:16,943 --> 00:51:19,772
Okay, Arnold.
Maybe later.

101
00:51:38,704 --> 00:51:41,881
Well, there you are.
You wanna go on a hike?

102
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:44,144
A hike?

103
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:46,799
Come on, you'll love it.
It's an old Navajo trail.

104
00:51:46,842 --> 00:51:48,279
Where's your mom?

105
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:50,890
Um, I don't know.
On the phone?

106
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:52,413
On the deck.

107
00:51:53,327 --> 00:51:55,982
-Oh. We're, uh--

108
00:51:56,025 --> 00:51:58,941
We're going for a hike.I'll be there
in a second.

109
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:01,509
I thought we weren't
doing work stuff
this weekend.

110
00:52:01,553 --> 00:52:03,946
I just need to do
this one thing.

111
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:05,905
Whatever.

112
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:09,126
Uh, so, yeah,
Mommy's just doing her thing.

113
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:11,084
You ever seen
a grown man do this?

114
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,137
-What do you think
she's talking about?
-Perfume and stuff.

115
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,529
Yeah,
that makes sense.

116
00:52:21,573 --> 00:52:25,185
Okay. Okay, I gotta go.
 Bye.

117
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:27,492
Sorry, boys.Ay-yi-yi.

118
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,278
So, what was
all that about?

119
00:52:32,018 --> 00:52:33,628
Oh, is this a guilt trip?

120
00:52:33,672 --> 00:52:36,414
Yeah.
I guess it is now.

121
00:52:36,457 --> 00:52:39,373
You know, I never said
I was gonna close myself off
to civilization this week.

122
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:41,506
You just wanna fight.

123
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:43,421
Fuck off.

124
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:47,120
Where's Arnold?

125
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:50,341
Fuck. Arnold!

126
00:52:50,384 --> 00:52:51,733
Arnold!

127
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,388
Arnold!

128
00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:58,000
Arnold! Where are you?
Arnold?

129
00:52:58,044 --> 00:53:00,916
-Arnold! Arnold!
-Arnold? Arnold!

130
00:53:02,744 --> 00:53:04,181
Arnold!

131
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:07,358
-You need help?
-Uh, yeah.

132
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:09,360
Our boy, we lost him.
He was right here.

133
00:53:09,403 --> 00:53:11,971
Come on, buddy.Uh, Arnold!

134
00:53:12,014 --> 00:53:14,452
-How old is he?
-Uh, six.

135
00:53:14,495 --> 00:53:15,931
-Oh, shit.
-Arnold! Come out!

136
00:53:15,975 --> 00:53:18,804
-Arnold!
- I'm over here!

137
00:53:18,847 --> 00:53:21,023
Arnold.

138
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:23,635
-I was peeing!

139
00:53:23,678 --> 00:53:26,246
You can't pee out there, son.

140
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,682
Come on back, bud.

141
00:53:29,858 --> 00:53:31,860
Better watch your boy.

142
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:40,042
You having fun, bud?

143
00:53:40,086 --> 00:53:42,654
I made a new friend
today.

144
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:45,961
A friend?

145
00:53:46,658 --> 00:53:48,181
Who's your friend?

146
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,488
William.
He hides in the woods.

147
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:54,361
Uh--

148
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:57,234
Uh, where did you meet
William, sweetie?

149
00:53:58,496 --> 00:54:01,586
In the backyard,
while you were on the phone.

150
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:05,154
Did you see William?

151
00:54:05,198 --> 00:54:07,592
I could only see
a part of him.

152
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:11,422
Well, which...
which part of him,
sweetie?

153
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:15,252
His face was hard to see
and his clothes were all dirty.

154
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,732
Is William a little boy?

155
00:54:19,168 --> 00:54:20,257
Yes.

156
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:24,696
Okay, is...
is William imaginary?

157
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:25,914
I don't think so.

158
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:31,006
You remember
your friend Randy, right?Yeah.

159
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,704
Is he like Randy?

160
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:35,533
Not really.

161
00:54:35,576 --> 00:54:37,622
But kind of
like Randy?

162
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:40,146
-Maybe a little bit.
-Okay.

163
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:42,888
Well,
Randy was imaginary.

164
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:45,412
Do you remember that?Yes.

165
00:54:45,456 --> 00:54:48,197
Yeah? Is that
what William is too?

166
00:54:51,462 --> 00:54:52,593
Yes.

167
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,380
Okay. All right.

168
00:54:56,423 --> 00:54:59,557
Hey, it's okay
to have imaginary friends.

169
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,820
We just wanna know
who they are.

170
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:03,604
Okay, bud?Okay.

171
00:55:03,648 --> 00:55:05,214
Okay.

172
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:12,134
Get in bed, sucka!

173
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:14,311
Dad!I ain't kiddin' around.

174
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:16,313
I got a surprise.What is it?

175
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:18,053
I'll ask the questions
around here.

176
00:55:18,097 --> 00:55:21,318
Now, you get in bed
or you'll never know.Fine.

177
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:23,929
What's my surprise?

178
00:55:24,582 --> 00:55:27,367
It's my...

179
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:28,629
tablet!

180
00:55:28,673 --> 00:55:30,283
Cool!Yeah!

181
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,330
Here. Just pop these things
in your ears there. Okay?

182
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:37,508
All right?
And you're good to go.Okay.

183
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:39,597
Good night, boss.Night.

184
00:55:44,384 --> 00:55:46,168
Hey, LensCrafters.

185
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:50,216
You wanna mess around?

186
00:55:52,174 --> 00:55:53,393
Get over here.

187
00:56:27,514 --> 00:56:29,560
Arnold.

188
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,087
Come play with us tonight,
Arnold.

189
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:38,177
My mom and dad said
you're not real.

190
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,309
Then they'll never know.

191
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:44,836
What's wrong with your head?

192
00:56:44,879 --> 00:56:46,185
Nothing's wrong, Arnold.

193
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:50,842
Let's go have some fun.

194
00:56:59,372 --> 00:57:01,461
Arnold? Arnold!

195
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:03,332
Where the fuck is he?

196
00:57:03,376 --> 00:57:06,161
Chris!
Chris, come in here!

197
00:57:07,032 --> 00:57:08,337
Chris!

198
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:10,035
Oh, fuck.What?
Jesus Christ!

199
00:57:10,078 --> 00:57:12,254
He's gone!
H-He's gone!

200
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:14,605
Arnold?

201
00:57:15,997 --> 00:57:17,129
Call the cops.

202
00:57:26,834 --> 00:57:28,009
Arnold!

203
00:57:33,275 --> 00:57:34,494
Arnold!

204
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:38,455
Arnold!

205
00:57:39,717 --> 00:57:41,022
Arnold!

206
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:42,415
Arnold!

207
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,373
Arnold!

208
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:46,593
Arnold! Arnold!

209
00:57:46,637 --> 00:57:48,160
Arnold!

210
00:57:53,426 --> 00:57:54,732
Arnold!

211
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:06,744
Arnold.

212
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:34,902
Where is Arnold?

213
00:58:45,086 --> 00:58:47,785
What did you do to him?

214
00:58:49,134 --> 00:58:52,180
We crawled inside his brain,
Daddy.

215
00:58:58,752 --> 00:59:00,841
Good boy, William.

216
00:59:07,108 --> 00:59:10,416
Now, eat, little Arnold.
Let Daddy see.

217
00:59:11,765 --> 00:59:13,288
No.

218
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:19,338
Arnold!

219
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:23,255
Can you see your boy, Daddy?
He's doing very well.

220
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:29,000
No. No!

221
00:59:29,043 --> 00:59:30,088
No!

222
01:00:45,424 --> 01:00:48,383
What happened to
Panagas the pagan?

223
01:00:51,212 --> 01:00:53,562
What the hell happened,
Panagas?

224
01:00:56,043 --> 01:00:58,132
What happened to us?

225
01:00:58,176 --> 01:01:01,353
It was Christmas.
Always fucking Christmas.

226
01:01:01,396 --> 01:01:04,661
We'd been drinking since
the break of dawn.

227
01:01:04,704 --> 01:01:08,490
"We're gonna burn this island to the ground!"

228
01:01:08,534 --> 01:01:12,320
We screamed, "More wine!"

229
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:16,498
Wine was sweating
from our pores.
Our minds had left us.

230
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:21,590
Every stinking Christmas with Panagas, always the same.

231
01:01:26,421 --> 01:01:31,818
It was December of 1984
when the goblin sneaked
into our village...

232
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:34,125
and into
our festive frenzies.

233
01:01:34,168 --> 01:01:36,997
He thought he could walk
unseen among us.

234
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:49,357
Louder! Louder!

235
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:54,188
Louder!

236
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:57,670
You old deaf bastard!
Louder!

237
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:01,326
No more, Panagas.
I've had enough
and so have you.

238
01:02:01,369 --> 01:02:04,546
Go home to your woman,
if she'll have you.

239
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:07,332
Come on, old man!
Play the stupid thing!

240
01:02:11,553 --> 01:02:13,991
We've got a ghetto blaster!

241
01:02:14,034 --> 01:02:17,298
All the way up!

242
01:02:17,342 --> 01:02:19,736
Put it all the way!

243
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,541
You're gonna stand there
and eat alone, you bastard?

244
01:02:42,584 --> 01:02:44,499
Don't want to share?

245
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:47,938
Who are you?
That you, Mr. Dimos?

246
01:02:47,981 --> 01:02:50,897
Shut up, Placenta.
Shut up.

247
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:52,594
Mr. Dimos, my ass.

248
01:02:52,638 --> 01:02:54,988
Why don't you lose
the hood?

249
01:02:55,032 --> 01:02:57,686
Lose the hood
so we can feast on you.

250
01:02:58,383 --> 01:03:00,428
I got him! I got him!

251
01:03:02,256 --> 01:03:03,692
Get back here, man!

252
01:03:04,128 --> 01:03:05,694
I got you!

253
01:03:07,218 --> 01:03:09,046
Get over here.

254
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:10,961
Who are you?

255
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:16,531
Take it off.

256
01:03:18,055 --> 01:03:20,579
Come on. Take it off.

257
01:03:20,622 --> 01:03:23,147
Up! Up! Up!

258
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:27,281
Do I know you?

259
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,851
Where the fuck
did you come from?

260
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:34,419
Holy shit.
Are you from the Land Below?

261
01:03:34,462 --> 01:03:37,422
Shut up, man.
You don't know
shit about shit.

262
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:39,990
But you will.
You'll see!

263
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:51,305
A goblin! A goblin!

264
01:03:54,439 --> 01:03:57,224
- To the hole!

265
01:03:57,268 --> 01:03:59,966
Let's fuck that goblin up!

266
01:04:05,754 --> 01:04:09,846
They call it
"The Hole," "The Burrow,"
"The Land Below."

267
01:04:13,153 --> 01:04:16,330
They say a fire burns
blue there, a frozen flame,

268
01:04:16,374 --> 01:04:18,985
the place where the goblins, little devils,

269
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:21,031
the children of
the Goat are born.

270
01:04:22,554 --> 01:04:25,905
In the Hole you are neither
dead nor alive.

271
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:28,038
Devoid of thought
and purpose.

272
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:30,431
To love
the Blue Flame only.

273
01:04:32,216 --> 01:04:36,220
That's what they say,
but no one has ever
come back to tell the tale.

274
01:05:00,635 --> 01:05:02,507
To the Hole!

275
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:05,205
To the Hole.

276
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,576
Get him, Peristeri.

277
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:33,407
Get to it, boy.

278
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:40,327
To the Hole!

279
01:05:46,899 --> 01:05:50,163
-To the Hole!

280
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:08,007
Don't cry about it
like a little girl.

281
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:11,010
I can't even look at you.
Get out of my sight.

282
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:12,794
Get out of here, Peristeri!

283
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:14,796
Go get the priest!

284
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,624
Go fetch
Zolotas the priest!

285
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:19,062
Go fetch
Zolotas the priest!

286
01:06:19,105 --> 01:06:22,761
The Hole is about to open up.
It's splitting.

287
01:06:51,572 --> 01:06:53,096
Priest Zolotas...

288
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,319
They call him the White Man, the Exorcist, the Heretic.

289
01:06:59,363 --> 01:07:01,539
I call him a bastard.

290
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,891
He's coming to fuck that goblin up, and he'll take his time too.

291
01:07:10,287 --> 01:07:13,116
They're all gonna
take their time
with the goblin.

292
01:07:15,814 --> 01:07:17,337
Like a communion.

293
01:07:18,251 --> 01:07:20,123
Like the Lord's supper.

294
01:07:21,428 --> 01:07:23,126
Take him.

295
01:07:23,865 --> 01:07:25,476
Take him.

296
01:08:04,776 --> 01:08:07,170
What do you want from me?

297
01:08:07,213 --> 01:08:10,651
Wine! Wine! Wine! Wine!

298
01:08:10,695 --> 01:08:14,307
Wine! Wine! Wine! Wine!

299
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,373
What do you want from me?

300
01:08:54,217 --> 01:08:58,046
Wine! Wine! Wine! Wine!

301
01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:00,136
Wine! Wine!

302
01:09:24,421 --> 01:09:27,598
They say
the blood of the goblin
drives you mad.

303
01:09:27,641 --> 01:09:29,469
They say it tastes
like Blue Flame.

304
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:36,346
Where are you, Panagas?

305
01:09:38,348 --> 01:09:44,484
The Hole is open!

306
01:09:48,358 --> 01:09:52,144
Leave, Panagas!

307
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:01,545
Where are you from,
brother?

308
01:10:01,588 --> 01:10:04,591
Did ou come from
the Land Below?

309
01:10:20,564 --> 01:10:23,871
Panagas!

310
01:10:58,341 --> 01:11:01,909
Panagas was our leader
and now he follows.

311
01:11:01,953 --> 01:11:05,043
He follows the Blue Flame.

312
01:11:05,086 --> 01:11:08,699
In muddy waters,
he's been baptized a pagan.

313
01:11:08,742 --> 01:11:12,355
Now, far away from
our sorrows and feasts.

314
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,844
Nobody saw a goblin
on the island again.

315
01:11:28,893 --> 01:11:31,809
Panagas was gone too.
Vanished.

316
01:11:34,855 --> 01:11:37,467
He's in the Land Below now.

317
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:42,863
Deep inside the Hole.

318
01:12:31,651 --> 01:12:33,392
Of the events that took place

319
01:12:33,436 --> 01:12:36,656
during that summer of 1913
in West Bengal...

320
01:12:39,006 --> 01:12:41,182
I have no desire to speak.

321
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:48,015
I am infected by those...
horrific events.

322
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,068
I cannot get them
out of my head.

323
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:59,157
Come on, faster!

324
01:13:00,724 --> 01:13:03,422
You both
are being lazy.

325
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:05,555
You could hardly
understand H.B. Gentry

326
01:13:05,598 --> 01:13:07,600
if you hadn't been
to India yourself.

327
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:14,259
He craved this disturbing
paradise of exaggeration.

328
01:13:16,957 --> 01:13:19,090
I was his assistant
in those days.

329
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,052
Gentry was an agent
for the American
Circus Corporation.

330
01:13:25,096 --> 01:13:31,189
He would ship Bengal tigers and whatever else he could find for the Ringling Brothers.

331
01:13:31,232 --> 01:13:34,322
So this king was utterly insane.

332
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:36,716
He cut off pieces of himself

333
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:40,154
and sat on his throne
with most
of his body parts gone.

334
01:13:42,766 --> 01:13:44,245
Mumbo-jumbo.

335
01:13:45,246 --> 01:13:47,945
Two bloody days
had better be worth it.

336
01:13:47,988 --> 01:13:51,644
The king bring them
for his pleasure, Mr. Gentry.

337
01:13:51,688 --> 01:13:54,691
You can fill your circuses
with them.

338
01:13:55,387 --> 01:13:57,128
Who takes care of them?

339
01:13:57,998 --> 01:13:59,478
There it is.

340
01:14:01,611 --> 01:14:05,266
Barnum used to say
Gentry had this
incredible gift of sight.

341
01:14:09,749 --> 01:14:11,795
That he had the strength

342
01:14:11,838 --> 01:14:14,406
to look at things
that others
could not stomach.

343
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:22,936
That's why
they sent him out there.

344
01:14:31,902 --> 01:14:33,207
Tell them...

345
01:14:34,992 --> 01:14:36,210
Sir!

346
01:14:36,254 --> 01:14:37,603
Come this way!
Come this way!

347
01:14:37,647 --> 01:14:39,431
Sir, we won't go any further.Come this way!

348
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,651
You'll get beaten up
if you throw tantrums.

349
01:14:57,928 --> 01:14:59,756
Sir! Listen, sir!

350
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:03,542
-Listen, sir.
- What?

351
01:15:03,586 --> 01:15:05,718
Give us our money here
and we will go back.

352
01:15:05,762 --> 01:15:08,242
I'll give!
I'llgive! I'll give!

353
01:15:08,286 --> 01:15:11,419
We won't go, sir.
We won't go.
We are going back.

354
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:15,249
- Don't create a fuss now.
- Oh, God!
No, we won't go, sir!

355
01:15:15,293 --> 01:15:17,034
Sir, we won't be able
to go ahead.

356
01:15:17,077 --> 01:15:18,688
That's a lot
of wild story.

357
01:15:18,731 --> 01:15:22,213
The freaks survived, Jim,
nd that's all that matters.

358
01:15:22,256 --> 01:15:24,911
We can't go ahead, sir.
We won't go!

359
01:15:25,782 --> 01:15:27,914
Listen! Both of you!No, no.

360
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:31,701
It scares us.Rascals!

361
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:56,203
Tell her.
Tell her that.

362
01:15:58,118 --> 01:16:00,817
They're saying
that the creatures
will be well taken care of.

363
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:02,775
These are God's children.

364
01:16:02,819 --> 01:16:04,603
What did she say?

365
01:16:04,647 --> 01:16:07,693
Can they buy them?
They'll pay good money.

366
01:16:09,956 --> 01:16:12,524
Tell her that
the creatures will be
well taken care of.

367
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:18,225
Come on, James.
For God's sake.

368
01:16:18,269 --> 01:16:19,792
I didn't pay you
to be sick.

369
01:16:21,664 --> 01:16:23,927
Can they buy them?

370
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:26,886
They'll pay good money.

371
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,678
How much just to see them?

372
01:16:35,721 --> 01:16:38,158
Mr. Gentry,
don't waver now.

373
01:16:54,087 --> 01:16:55,132
Remarkable.

374
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,700
Good Lord.

375
01:16:59,484 --> 01:17:01,225
Oh, God.

376
01:17:01,268 --> 01:17:04,097
Oh, my God.

377
01:17:16,066 --> 01:17:18,285
My God, what was that?

378
01:17:20,461 --> 01:17:21,593
Open it.

379
01:17:23,551 --> 01:17:25,379
Don't open that!

380
01:17:25,423 --> 01:17:28,731
Mr. Gentry,
there is a shrine inside.
It is not for us.

381
01:17:29,819 --> 01:17:31,821
Oh, for God's sakes,
you're a man of science.

382
01:17:31,864 --> 01:17:35,259
That houses a holy being.
One cannot worship it directly.

383
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,654
I need to see it.

384
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:40,177
Come on. Pay her.

385
01:17:42,092 --> 01:17:45,269
You cannot look
upon it. It is beyond what
human vision can take.

386
01:18:05,028 --> 01:18:07,421
This should be enough
for three years.

387
01:18:07,465 --> 01:18:10,076
We'll ship them
to London next week.

388
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,035
Would you travel back with us?

389
01:18:12,078 --> 01:18:14,080
Gentry says we stay
until the morning.

390
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:18,694
I don't recommend
you and Mr. Gentry

391
01:18:18,737 --> 01:18:19,825
to stay back here.

392
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:37,713
We'll do this tonight,
Jim.

393
01:18:39,889 --> 01:18:43,936
Their gods are real.
I'm not going to do it.

394
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,938
Goddamn you, Jim.

395
01:18:47,287 --> 01:18:48,767
I'm not paying you
a dime.

396
01:19:20,494 --> 01:19:22,148
I hated Gentry.

397
01:19:24,585 --> 01:19:28,372
His quest for novel scenes
and perverse spectacles

398
01:19:28,415 --> 01:19:30,766
was feverish and insatiate.

399
01:19:34,334 --> 01:19:36,162
I often wished him dead.

400
01:20:33,437 --> 01:20:35,265
If heaven is merciful,

401
01:20:35,308 --> 01:20:38,572
it will someday efface
from my consciousness...

402
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:42,925
the sight
that I saw that night...

403
01:20:47,886 --> 01:20:50,410
and let me live
my last years in peace.

404
01:21:46,162 --> 01:21:47,293
Gentry!

405
01:21:48,555 --> 01:21:49,905
Gentry!

406
01:22:13,406 --> 01:22:15,974
Heaven be thanked
for the instinct
which led me...

407
01:22:17,367 --> 01:22:18,455
to a most...

408
01:22:19,238 --> 01:22:20,848
peaceful sleep...

409
01:22:23,547 --> 01:22:26,202
under the calm stars
of clear skies.

410
01:22:28,421 --> 01:22:31,294
God, I crave a sleep

411
01:22:31,337 --> 01:22:33,165
whose dreams
I should not remember.

412
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:39,389
Now I lay me down to sleep.

413
01:22:39,432 --> 01:22:40,825
I close my eyes.

414
01:22:40,868 --> 01:22:42,653
I pray the Lord...

415
01:22:42,696 --> 01:22:45,569
When I opened them, I was in a Calcutta hospital...

416
01:22:45,612 --> 01:22:47,397
...my soul to keep.

417
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,007
...singing a great deal.

418
01:22:49,051 --> 01:22:52,315
If I should die
before I wake...

419
01:22:52,358 --> 01:22:55,579
And laughing oddly,
but unable to sing.

420
01:22:55,622 --> 01:22:59,452
...I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

421
01:22:59,496 --> 01:23:01,367
Amen.

422
01:24:23,754 --> 01:24:24,972
Good boy, Wachter.

423
01:24:27,497 --> 01:24:29,803
Tomorrow we will
hunt something.

424
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:54,714
Anni?

425
01:26:58,474 --> 01:27:00,040
My dearest.

426
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:27,198
Brother,
I had a terrible dream.

427
01:27:28,634 --> 01:27:30,897
Our cow Minka...

428
01:27:46,217 --> 01:27:48,306
Now the Drude bit you too.

429
01:28:31,088 --> 01:28:34,265
What if our last cow
dies as well?

430
01:28:35,266 --> 01:28:37,050
We will find a solution.

431
01:28:37,094 --> 01:28:40,358
You will not survive
another winter up here.

432
01:28:40,402 --> 01:28:42,578
Go down to the valley.
The snow will come soon.

433
01:28:42,621 --> 01:28:44,493
I will not leave you
here alone.

434
01:28:46,233 --> 01:28:48,323
Do you want to end up
like our parents?

435
01:28:50,281 --> 01:28:53,197
Do you know how much energy
it takes to control her?

436
01:28:55,155 --> 01:28:58,333
Soon nothing will be left
of the good Anni.

437
01:28:59,725 --> 01:29:02,728
There is only one way out.

438
01:29:08,386 --> 01:29:10,214
We need to put
an end to this.

439
01:29:40,113 --> 01:29:41,637
Wachter?

440
01:29:50,123 --> 01:29:52,952
-Wachter, come here!

441
01:29:54,127 --> 01:29:57,000
-Here, I said!

442
01:30:00,482 --> 01:30:02,788
-Begone!

443
01:30:02,832 --> 01:30:04,964
Shh!

444
01:31:02,979 --> 01:31:04,197
Wachter!

445
01:31:07,766 --> 01:31:09,681
Come here!

446
01:31:32,356 --> 01:31:34,140
My good boy.

447
01:31:50,026 --> 01:31:52,594
Did you take good care
of our cow Liesl?

448
01:31:54,291 --> 01:31:56,336
Leave me alone,
you witch.

449
01:32:50,608 --> 01:32:52,828
The Lord is the shadow
over your right hand.

450
01:32:52,871 --> 01:32:55,047
He will keep you
from evil.No prayer will help now.

451
01:32:55,091 --> 01:32:58,137
He will protect your soul.This is God's punishment.

452
01:32:59,965 --> 01:33:01,097
Do it.

453
01:33:04,753 --> 01:33:07,277
Quickly. It is time.

454
01:33:10,759 --> 01:33:12,499
Goddamn it.
Come on.

455
01:33:14,676 --> 01:33:15,981
Brother.

456
01:33:40,658 --> 01:33:42,486
We will stay together.
