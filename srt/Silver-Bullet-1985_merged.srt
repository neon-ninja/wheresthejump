1
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,371
<i>The last full moon of that spring...</i>

2
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:05,000
<i>...came a little more than a month before
school let out for summer vacation.</i>

3
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,053
<i>Our town's long nightmare began that night.</i>

4
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,935
<i>My beer is Rheingold, the dry beer</i>

5
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:27,523
<i>Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer</i>

6
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:32,903
<i>It's not bitter, not sweet,
it's a real frosty treat</i>

7
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:37,408
<i>Won't you buy, won't you buy...</i>

8
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,248
<i>Won't you try, won't you buy, Rheingold Beer.</i>

9
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:02,474
Jesus, Arnie,
are you afraid of the boogeyman?

10
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:08,814
God... Come on outta there, Buster,
and give me a hand.

11
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:15,362
All right. What is it that you want, Arnie?

12
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,698
I want some Rheingold.

13
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
And what're you gonna do...
Soon as I get that dirt outta there...

14
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,098
Rheingold time, Arnie!

15
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,648
Oh, shit!

16
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:04,745
<i>The killing had begun.
But at first no one knew it.</i>

17
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,457
<i>You see, Arnie Westrum was a chronic drunk.</i>

18
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,335
<i>And what happened seemed like an accident.</i>

19
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:15,297
<i>The county coroner concluded
that Arnie had passed out on the tracks.</i>

20
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:18,425
<i>There wasn't enough evidence
to conclude anything else.</i>

21
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:24,139
- Yeah!
- Did you remember the deviled-ham?

22
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:30,354
It's such a wonderful day!

23
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,607
<i>This is Tarker's Mills, where I grew up.</i>

24
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,651
<i>And this is how it looked that spring.</i>

25
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:40,155
<i>A town where people cared about each other
as much as they cared about themselves.</i>

26
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,503
<i>I was nearly 15 years old
and my brother Marty was 11.</i>

27
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,881
We'd like to get things started now.

28
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,013
May I have your attention please, everybody?

29
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,266
We'd like to get things started now,
if we could.

30
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,645
A lotta chairs down here.
Come on right down and sit down.

31
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:18,277
Alright, without further ado, I'd like
to turn things over to Reverend Lowe.

32
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,283
I'm gonna go, okay?

33
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,828
- Alright, but stay close.
- Thank you, folks.

34
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,874
- Now, last June the...
- And make sure your brother's okay.

35
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,418
"Make sure your brother's okay."

36
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,379
Marty's a booger.

37
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,383
- Wow!
- <i>Marty was the cross I had to bear.</i>

38
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:42,843
Isn't that a garter snake?

39
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,721
- Hell, no.
- <i>He wasn't so bad, actually.</i>

40
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,014
Lemme hold him.

41
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:51,185
<i>He was just constantly
thrown in my face by my parents.</i>

42
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,355
- I have an idea.
- What?

43
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,860
Oh, you wouldn't.

44
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,363
Oh, you would.

45
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:07,618
- Only let's not go bananas or anything.
- Who, me?

46
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:13,415
An endeavor like this seems to me to be
the very definition of "community".

47
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,209
Marty?

48
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,963
Marty?

49
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,307
- Aww, Janie!
- Goddammit!

50
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,188
Come on, Jane, it was just a garden snake.

51
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,899
Look at my hose!

52
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,943
Oh, I hate you!

53
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,529
Jane, I'm shocked at you!

54
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,032
Stop it, Brady.

55
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:52,788
Look alive!

56
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,836
Hey, Jane, did you wet your pants?

57
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,295
Jane, I'm sorry.

58
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,339
Oh, yeah, sure.

59
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,633
- I didn't mean to.
- Oh, no...!

60
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:08,929
You never mean to! I hate you, you booger!

61
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,598
I hate you!

62
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,685
Well, sure looks like we got
her goat this time, didn't we?

63
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:18,814
Shut up, Brady! You're warped.

64
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,164
Come here, for a minute,
I have to talk to you.

65
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,000
Listen, I told you, it ain't my baby.

66
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,877
- Don't you ever drag me off like that!
- I can't believe you'd say that.

67
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,086
You know it's your baby.

68
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,672
- We've had this conversation before.
- You know I wasn't with anybody else.

69
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,882
I need help!

70
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,302
It's your oven.
But it ain't my bun you're baking!

71
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,929
- I have to have some help!
- Remember the good times.

72
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,431
You know, what I mean?

73
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:02,691
I want you two to bury the hatchet.
You're being very silly, Jane.

74
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,486
Did you see my knee? Did you see my outfit?

75
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,654
Marty has apologized.

76
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:11,617
And you know he couldn't have
climbed the tree to stop Brady anyway.

77
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,869
You always take his side
because he's crippled.

78
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,621
Well, it's not my fault he's crippled!

79
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:19,833
You just wanna be quiet or
I'm gonna smack you now, I mean it!

80
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,045
Come on, Jane, I'm sorry.
Brady wouldn't stop.

81
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:01,583
Hey, pumpkin,
don't forget to help your brother.

82
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:16,223
- Bob, I don't have my keys.
- Just a minute, sweetheart.

83
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,976
Don't sweat the small stuff, Janie.

84
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,271
Honey, where do you want this?

85
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,190
Come on. Hurry up.

86
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,119
Is Uncle Red still coming to visit?

87
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:41,248
Mom told dad that Uncle Red's
getting a divorce. Another divorce.

88
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,168
And she said he was drunk.
Now that's your great uncle. A chronic drunk!

89
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,921
- He is not!
- He is so!

90
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,731
Janie?

91
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,650
Janie, you awake?

92
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,510
What's the money for?

93
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,804
A new pair of panty hose.

94
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,473
Is it enough?

95
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:51,276
Jane, please take the money.
It was Brady's idea. Honest to God.

96
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,570
I wanna make up.

97
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,617
I can get a pair of L'eggs
down at the pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine.

98
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,287
Here.

99
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:11,004
Is it true what you said about Uncle Red?

100
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,047
Yeah.

101
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,843
I'm sorry I told you the way I did.
It was mean.

102
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,720
It's okay.

103
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,432
I never did much like Sheila anyway.

104
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,061
Maybe I'll like the next one better.

105
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,442
Suicides go to hell.

106
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,278
Especially if they're pregnant.

107
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,821
And I don't even care.

108
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,987
It's not a normal situation down here.

109
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,782
Well, that's what you told me this morning.

110
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,786
Well, I'm happy to hear that.
You think it'll be sometime this week?

111
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,497
Well, that's good. When and how many?

112
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,250
Hey, fuck off!

113
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,378
What'd he say, Joe?

114
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,756
He said they'd be here by noon.

115
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,717
Maybe it wasn't a good idea...

116
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:06,888
...telling that Smokey Bear
from the detective division to fuck off.

117
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:10,141
Well, I waited till he hung up.

118
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:13,395
Jesus Christ, what a mess.

119
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:17,023
Joe Haller couldn't find his own ass
if somebody rammed it full of radium...

120
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,401
- ...and gave him a Geiger counter.
- Could be.

121
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,862
I know a fella who's still P.O.'d...

122
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,990
...about being fined a couple hundred bucks
for that little, uh...

123
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:29,286
...fender bender he had
back on the Ridge Road last year.

124
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,414
Well, could be I know a fat ol' fella...

125
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:37,252
...who oughta take care of his mouth
before someone turns it inside out.

126
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:47,304
We pay our taxes to keep this town safe.

127
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,848
And Joe Haller ain't doin' it.

128
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,977
Last town report said
you were in arrears in your taxes, Andy.

129
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,605
Guess you caught up, huh?

130
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,444
Whatta you, tryin' to be smart?

131
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:08,491
Now you boys better turn down your
thermostats or you can both get out!

132
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,368
You got me?

133
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,370
Now, who's drinkin'?

134
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,585
- Have a wonderful summer.
- Yes, yourself.

135
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:22,422
Hey, it's Madman Marty in the Silver Bullet.

136
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,383
So, Marty, are you allowed to be out of jail?

137
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,261
- No, I like school.
- Poor guy.

138
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,972
Be careful.

139
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,394
Not bad, huh?

140
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,606
Uncle Red changed the regular muffler
for a cherry bomb.

141
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,775
- What's that?
- Glasspack!

142
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:45,320
He said he's making me a new wheelchair.
A custom job.

143
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,613
But now I dunno.

144
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,366
He's getting divorced
and he's in the dog house with my mom.

145
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,869
- For getting a divorce?
- Well, it is his third.

146
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,511
Come on, Tammy.

147
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,352
Thanks for coming home with me, Marty.

148
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,146
I was scared to pass her house alone.

149
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,941
Yeah, it is a little scary.

150
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:28,571
I mean, I saw her all the time.

151
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,783
Hey, take it easy.

152
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:36,121
- I know how you feel.
- There's something else scary.

153
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,666
What?

154
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,418
That.

155
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,586
I've been hearing noises out there.

156
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,215
Tammy!

157
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,927
Tammy, get on in here!
Help your mama with the laundry.

158
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,179
Well, I would go take a look myself...

159
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:56,933
...but I think the Bullet'd get stuck.

160
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,354
You would, wouldn't you?

161
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,233
Yeah, sure. No sweat.

162
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,151
Tammy!

163
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,153
I gotta go, Tammy.

164
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,156
Thanks again for coming home with me.

165
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:19,539
Damn cripples! Always end up on welfare!

166
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:28,339
I'd electrocute 'em all.
Balance the Goddamn budget!

167
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,844
Oh, come on, baby.

168
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,615
- Hey, Mr. Cutts.
- Well, Marty...

169
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,284
...I see you lucked out again.

170
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,745
Yep. Would you fill her up, please?

171
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,081
Want me to check the oil?

172
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,583
Yeah, sure.

173
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:08,129
Wipe the windshield,
check the driver's bullshit level?

174
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,969
There was a guy sitting in a bar.

175
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,763
"Bartender.", he says,
"Hey, jackass, gimme a drink".

176
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,556
So the bartender pours a drink.

177
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,559
And he drinks it. He sits for a while,
then says, "Jackass, pour me another."

178
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:22,769
Se he pours another.

179
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:27,357
This other guys asks the bartender,
"Why do you let him call you jackass?"

180
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,569
The bartender says:
"Hee-aw, hee-aw, he always calls me that."

181
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,324
- It's good isn't it?
- Yeah.

182
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,745
You might as well fold, because you
don't stand a Chinaman's chance.

183
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,288
Yeah...

184
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:46,251
Uh, I'll see ya, and I'll raise you this.

185
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,669
You can't bet managers.

186
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,963
- You can't bet managers.
- Okay, okay.

187
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,049
- I always said you can't bet managers.
- So I'll bet a Yankee.

188
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,010
Piss on the Yankees, piss on the Indians...

189
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,304
- Time for bed.
- Piss on...

190
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,681
Mom, come on.

191
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:03,977
Whoa, Nan. Let him finish the game.

192
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,395
Okay?

193
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,522
- Make it quick.
- Okay.

194
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,527
What did you say, "Yankee"? See your Yankee.

195
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,072
And I'll call ya. I got three kings.
Read 'em and weep.

196
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,243
I got a straight to the Queen.

197
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,955
That's bullshit luck! Bullshit luck!

198
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,916
- That's enough! That's enough!
- I'm thinkin'...

199
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,087
Hey, hold it!
Can I say, can I at least say good night?

200
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,090
Good night.

201
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,803
- Good night.
- Good night.

202
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,430
- See you later.
- Okay.

203
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,140
- See you in the morning. Wake me up.
- Okay.

204
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,308
- No, I'll wake you up.
- Okay.

205
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,726
Okay.

206
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:55,528
Honey, ask your sister to help you.
I'll be up in a minute.

207
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,322
I will.

208
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,283
Good night.

209
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,189
I don't want you drinking around Marty.

210
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:34,943
Don't be tellin' me what to do!
You've told me what to do all my life.

211
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,028
Red, I don't care how you live...

212
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:40,323
...but he is a very
impressionable little boy.

213
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,659
You know,
you think your only responsibility...

214
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,663
...is gettin' his butt outta the chair
and into the tub or the toilet.

215
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:51,000
You oughta realize there's more to Marty
than him not being able to walk.

216
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,463
- It's so easy for you, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is!

217
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:59,634
You blow in here once a month and you
tell a few jokes and have a few beers...

218
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:03,137
...and then you wanna lecture me
about how to raise my son!

219
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:07,267
I am the one who's responsible for
how he feels when you're like this.

220
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,436
And for how he feels when you leave.

221
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,980
Red...

222
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,149
Marty has enough strikes
against him as it is.

223
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,734
He doesn't have any strikes!

224
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,737
I'm scared that one day he'll quit!

225
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:20,863
He's not gonna give up!

226
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:24,325
What he doesn't need is you showin' him how!

227
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,586
Another wonderful night here at Sister Nan's.

228
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,380
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

229
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,340
<i>...to the very best
of professional wrestling:</i>

230
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,510
<i>World Wide Wrestling.
And John, we got a very exciting match.</i>

231
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,721
<i>We have one of the young lions in there...</i>

232
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:49,392
Come on, Rebel!
We're gonna bust him up tonight!

233
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:54,731
We're gonna kick some ass!
We're gonna kick some ass!

234
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:05,742
Bust him up! Bust his chops!

235
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:15,168
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah, Rebel, airplane!

236
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,755
Ooooh, that's it! Oh, that hurts my parts!

237
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,554
Goddamn...

238
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,894
I'm just gonna have to do
somethin' about this.

239
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,903
Let's see if you wanna
come back and bust up my pots...

240
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,740
...after I put rock salt up your ass!

241
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,748
Come around bust up my pots,
I'm gonna bust up your ass!

242
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,917
Sons-o'-bitches!

243
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:04,258
I hope you're in there cause
I'm gonna blow your ass off with this salt!

244
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,665
Shit!

245
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

246
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

247
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

248
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

249
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:34,200
Ain't that a hell of a note!

250
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,371
Isn't that something?

251
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:43,960
<i>...observe Sheriff Haller's curfew,
after 5 p.m., please stay indoors.</i>

252
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,753
Haller!

253
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,677
- Well, you got any leads?
- I'm working on it, Mayor.

254
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,556
Mr. Mayor.

255
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:04,897
David!

256
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,985
Mommy wants you to get inside.

257
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,601
- Brady, I got it.
- Great!

258
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:43,853
Marty Coslaw, you get outta that tree!

259
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,522
Supper was ready an hour ago, dumbo.

260
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:49,775
Oh, Jeez, I forgot. Is she mad?

261
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:53,321
Yeah. At me for not finding you sooner!

262
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:04,457
- Help me with the Bullet, please.
- I oughta let you fall.

263
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,909
Hey, Brady, you comin'?

264
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,078
In a while!

265
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:44,413
Come on, Marty.

266
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,251
Marty, it's getting late.

267
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,356
And we oughta make Joe Haller,
uh, dog catcher.

268
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,359
- You know, nothing big, just for poodles...
- Andy, lighten up!

269
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,027
Let Joe handle the investigation.

270
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,862
- Investigation?
- Yeah.

271
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:22,201
This investigation is as efficient
as a submarine with screen doors.

272
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,371
I've heard enough outta you, Andy Fairton.

273
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,457
- Come on, Pete, it's not worth it!
- Let him go!

274
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:33,295
If you don't shut your mouth,
I'm gonna shut it for you!

275
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,465
What'd you say?

276
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:40,177
You heard what I said, Motor Mouth!

277
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:43,597
You wanna dance, Snow boy? Come on!

278
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:47,977
Has anybody in here seen my son Brady?

279
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:57,862
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

280
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:02,950
Blessed art thou among women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

281
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,997
Hail Mary, Mother of God...

282
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,459
Pray for us sinners...

283
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,463
...now and at the hour of our death...

284
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:27,892
Herb, Herb, wait up, Herb!

285
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,853
- Herb! Come on, Herb!
- Is that my boy?

286
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,189
- Herb, don't go up there!
- Is that Brady?

287
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,815
- Herb!
- Brady!

288
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,729
Mr. And Mrs. Kincaid have asked...

289
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:59,608
...that I say a word of comfort to you,
if I could.

290
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:06,156
If there is any word of comfort
I can give you, it's just this.

291
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,870
That the face of the beast
always becomes known.

292
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:15,291
And the time of the beast always passes.

293
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:25,551
Nan, how about if I take the boy home?

294
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,136
Red...

295
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:32,600
- Okay.
- Thank you.

296
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,602
Come on, Marty, you're going with me.

297
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,521
- Jane, see you at the house.
- All right.

298
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,857
- Come on.
- How do you feel?

299
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,442
How would you feel?

300
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:49,158
I guess they better get that guy.

301
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,452
- Uncle Red?
- Yeah?

302
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,954
What if it's not a guy?

303
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,832
What do you mean?

304
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:01,337
Well, what if it's some kind of monster?

305
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,304
Yeah, what if it's some kind of monster?

306
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:16,393
- You know, a werewolf or something?
- That's a good one! Yeah!

307
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:26,320
Here we go.

308
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:30,032
You know, Tammy told me
she'd heard noises in the greenhouse.

309
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,825
Growling noises.

310
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:35,371
Her father was killed that night.

311
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:43,295
Listen, Marty! You have got to get
this idea out of your head!

312
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,883
Psychotics are more active
when the moon is full.

313
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,637
And this guy's a psycho.

314
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,599
When they catch him you're gonna find out
he's just as human as you and me.

315
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:58,560
- Let's get the show on the road!
- Okay, okay!

316
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:03,399
You all know what groups you're in
and what areas you'll be covering.

317
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:07,277
Groups one through four in the woods
north of the Sturmfuller place.

318
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:10,781
- Okay!
- Five and six west of Carson Creek.

319
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,366
- Yeah
- Yeah

320
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:16,578
If he comes out in the moonlight tonight,
we're gonna get that sucker!

321
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,373
I want all of you people to go home!

322
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,375
I don't remember deputizing
a single one of you.

323
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,626
That's right, Joe!

324
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,504
The only deputy you got
is that fat shit bag beside you.

325
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:29,299
And neither one of you has done
anything about solving this case!

326
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:32,803
- We'll catch him.
- You couldn't catch a cold!

327
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,309
The law has a name
for what you people are planning.

328
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,979
It's called "private justice".

329
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:49,486
And private justice is about a step away
from lynch mobs and hang ropes!

330
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:55,409
Now, I may be no J. Edgar Hoover,
but I am the law in Tarker's Mills.

331
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,248
I want all you people to go home.

332
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,335
Don't let this guy scare you!

333
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,714
And what's he done since this whole thing
started but hang his face out?

334
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,759
- He ain't got so much as a fingerprint!
- Shut up, Andy!

335
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:14,928
- No, don't tell me to shut up!
- Yes!

336
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,265
Shut up!

337
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:31,028
I just came from my boy's funeral.

338
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:39,495
Herb, I know how upset...

339
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,875
- ...how grief-stricken you must be.
- He was torn apart.

340
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,877
I know that. I...

341
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:49,838
Upset?

342
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,258
Grief-stricken?

343
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,762
You don't know what those words mean.

344
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:01,266
My son was torn to pieces.

345
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,728
Pieces!

346
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:11,401
My son was torn to pieces!

347
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:19,868
You come in here and talk to these men
about "private justice"?

348
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,082
You dare to do that!

349
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:32,881
Why don't you go out
to Harmony Hill, Sheriff Haller...

350
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:37,719
...and dig up what's left of my boy Brady...

351
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:41,056
...and explain to him
about "private justice".

352
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,352
Would you wanna do that?

353
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:50,983
As for me...

354
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:57,239
...I'm gonna go out and
hunt up a little private justice.

355
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:05,622
You heard him!

356
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,583
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

357
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,425
Come on, boys!

358
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,720
- Get outta the way, Reverend.
- Stop! Stop!

359
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:23,140
Andy, Andy! Don't do this!

360
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,894
- Joe!
- Let 'em go, Reverend.

361
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:30,772
This is that "community spirit"
you talked about.

362
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,242
Come on, boys, let's go!

363
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:47,831
Virgil! Stop, stop!
This is a bad idea. Don't do this!

364
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,126
No! David, no!

365
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,630
David!

366
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:58,967
Please! Please!

367
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:07,976
It's about frickin' time!

368
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,414
Come on!

369
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,049
- What was that?
- It's over there.

370
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,176
Don't point that at me.

371
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,345
- Over here, Bob.
- Move it up there!

372
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,639
- So we can tell which way it's going.
- Okay.

373
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:48,767
Come on up here. Come on, Jerry, this way.

374
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,895
- Damn, Jack. Turn away!
- All right, all right.

375
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:55,232
- Move the other way.
- I'm sorry.

376
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,191
Come on!

377
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jesus, that was close.
Come on. Be careful.

378
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,158
- You gotta help me!
- What is it?

379
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:51,496
- My foot! My foot! Get it off me!
- I'm coming, Sure. Sure.

380
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,879
Okay. Okay!

381
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,048
Hey, over here!

382
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:05,177
Hold on. I'll get it! I'll get it!

383
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,269
Watch each other's back now.

384
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,858
Andy, there ain't nothin' here.
Let's go back to the car!

385
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,735
Bobby, come on.

386
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:27,199
- Careful, Maggie.
- Damn!

387
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:32,079
Alright, we're gonna go through here.

388
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:35,957
- You follow me one at a time.
- I'm right behind you.

389
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,177
Wait.

390
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,904
- It came from over there.
- As far as I could tell, it came in back of us.

391
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,615
He ain't down there, Andy.

392
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:13,245
We're gonna spread out in a skirmish line.
That son-of-a-bitch tries to come around us.

393
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,247
We'll get him!

394
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,333
Okay, Edgar.

395
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,795
Oh, shit!

396
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:28,927
Come on.

397
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,264
I don't know...

398
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,850
What's wrong, Bobbie,
you gonna make lemonade in your pants?

399
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,978
I ain't scared! Let's go.

400
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Where's it coming from? Over there?

401
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,967
No, it's behind us.

402
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,678
I told you you couldn't trust this fog.

403
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:16,057
It's under the fog.

404
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,851
What are you saying?

405
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's right here with us.

406
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

407
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,000
I can't move!

408
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,628
Start backing up, Andy!

409
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,840
Real... slow.

410
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,185
Oh, my God!

411
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,356
Come on, come on!

412
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:13,240
Son-of-bitch! I'll get...

413
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:31,276
It's hard...

414
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:37,741
...at a time like this to find the words
to offer you any comfort.

415
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:40,535
There is no comfort!

416
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:48,335
There is only private justice.

417
00:43:52,922 --> 00:44:00,096
The Bible tells us not to fear the terror...

418
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,641
...that creepeth by night.

419
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:05,727
Or that which flyeth by noon day.

420
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,356
And yet, we do. We do.

421
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:14,444
Because there's so much we don't know.
And we feel very small.

422
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:18,073
Reverend! He was torn apart!

423
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:27,749
No!

424
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,459
No!

425
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:14,921
Let it end, dear God! Let it end.

426
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:31,020
Oh, they cancelled the fireworks!
It's no fair.

427
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:34,899
Oh, look out world, Marty the Great
didn't get something he wanted!

428
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:38,695
- Stop it, Jane!
- I don't see why everybody cries...

429
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:42,949
- ...when Marty doesn't get what he wants.
- Pumpkin, what did your mother say?

430
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,870
It's time you backed off, young lady!

431
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:50,415
- Oh, it's always my fault.
- Jane, you won't let up.

432
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,168
- Come on, now, let's get home.
- I don't believe it.

433
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:57,172
<i>Residents can insure their safety
by observing the sheriff's curfew...</i>

434
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,883
<i>...and not by leaving town.</i>

435
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,468
<i>And a personal note, folks:</i>

436
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:05,472
<i>This is a time for pulling together,
not for bailing out.</i>

437
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:08,475
<i>Now for Sue Ann Eckerstein.</i>

438
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,992
I need the Phillips screwdriver.

439
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:32,582
It's not enough the monster
killed all those people.

440
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,542
He killed Brady.

441
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:37,587
Now he's got them to cancel the fair.

442
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:41,716
- And the fireworks.
- Yeah, and the fireworks.

443
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,676
That's another thing.

444
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,639
- Where's your mom?
- She and Dad are lighting the barbeque.

445
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:50,558
And Jane's walking around
in her new clothes showing off her tits.

446
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:53,436
Acts like nobody ever had tits before her.

447
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,111
Let me see if I got this right.

448
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:04,697
The guy killed your best friend.

449
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,283
Drove your best girl outta town.

450
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:10,703
Now he's responsible
for cancelling the only carnival you got.

451
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:12,872
Am I lying?

452
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:15,124
Now, you're not lying, Uncle Red.

453
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:20,880
Well, it just so happens that I've got
something that might cheer you up...

454
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:23,424
Oh, you mean I can see it?

455
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:25,468
Yeah, it's time.

456
00:47:25,552 --> 00:47:27,512
- Now?
- Yeah, now. Cover your eyes.

457
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:28,972
- Oh, come on.
- Cover your eyes.

458
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:32,308
- Oh, Jesus...
- I busted my ass on this deal.

459
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,621
Wow!

460
00:47:58,251 --> 00:48:00,420
It's an ass-kicker, isn't it?

461
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,466
- Is that for me?
- Hell yes, it's for you!

462
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:12,181
- Damn, looks good!
- Wow, it's beautiful!

463
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:17,687
- Do you have a pilot's license?
- Do I need one?

464
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,572
- Hey!
- Hey, Red.

465
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:33,912
- The coast is clear. Are you ready?
- Oh, yeah.

466
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:36,623
I feel like a virgin on prom night.

467
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:38,625
Here's how you start it.

468
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:43,129
- Remember what I told you?
- Yeah.

469
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,006
- Now be damned careful.
- Okay.

470
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,799
- Now, you start it.
- Okay.

471
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,551
- Put your hand on the brake.
- Push?

472
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:50,053
Push!

473
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,556
- Sounds good, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

474
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,058
- Yeah, you ready?
- Yes.

475
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,643
Shake!

476
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,395
Go get 'em, now!

477
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:03,983
Go! Be careful!

478
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,577
Stop, brake!

479
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,872
Oh, the kid's dead meat!

480
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,335
Oh, yes!

481
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:26,673
All right!

482
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:50,613
Oh, yeah!

483
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,508
That was wicked.

484
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:15,847
I hope you're happy.
You're lookin' at a dying man here.

485
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,850
This thing goes super, super fast.

486
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:22,520
I know it goes super fast.
And you better watch out.

487
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,689
Because if your mother finds out
just how fast it goes...

488
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:28,192
...I'm gonna end up
singing soprano in the boy's choir.

489
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:31,863
- You know, I don't get you.
- I know you don't.

490
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:32,989
But listen to me.

491
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:38,327
I built that for you because
I love ya, right from my heart.

492
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:40,288
And I want you to be careful on it.

493
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,999
Because if you got hurt, it'd kill me.

494
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,084
Let's get some barbecue, okay?

495
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:48,296
Boy I tell you,
after every pork dinner I eat...

496
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:49,964
...I got fire in the hole.

497
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:52,592
- One more piece of pie.
- Are you sure about that?

498
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:56,721
- Oh, Jesus...
- Would anybody else like a bite?

499
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,139
- The mayo's good.
- Well, go ahead.

500
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,767
Listen, no, put it down.

501
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,227
- I've gotta go.
- Okay.

502
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:05,813
- I've had a wonderful time.
- So have I.

503
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:07,315
I wish it could always be like this.

504
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:10,943
Maybe it will, if you keep inviting me
to these pork dinners.

505
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:12,528
- Okay, it's a deal.
- Well, nice to meet you.

506
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:13,654
Thanks. You too.

507
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:15,239
- Bye.
- See you later, Janie.

508
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:17,366
- Bob.
- So long, Red.

509
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:20,787
- Good thing you didn't spill my drink.
- Okay.

510
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,581
Why don't you walk me to my car?

511
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,666
Walk me to my car and see if I can
stay out of trouble.

512
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,293
- Thanks!
- Bye!

513
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:30,171
- Bye!
- Come on, let's go!

514
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:35,760
Can I have some more coffee?

515
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:41,474
I tell you, I'm gonna start up
a reptile farm...

516
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:44,852
- You're nuts.
- That'd be some kind of barbecue!

517
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:46,813
Here we go. Hold on.

518
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:56,739
Now, I said I had something for you,
as I believe you do recall.

519
00:51:56,823 --> 00:51:59,325
Yeah, what is it?

520
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:04,539
You're gonna have Fourth of July,
but you're gonna have it in September.

521
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,918
Now remember, it isn't just the fireworks.

522
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:12,088
It's so no crazy shithead
can stop the good guys...

523
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,590
- If you can dig that.
- Yeah, I dig it.

524
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:16,759
- Now stay near the house.
- Yeah, sure.

525
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:18,302
Okay.

526
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:21,430
Save this for the last.

527
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:24,684
It's a rocket. You'll like it.

528
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,311
- Thanks a million, Uncle Red.
- You're welcome a Million, Marty.

529
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:30,857
- And stick 'em in the bushes for now, okay?
- All right.

530
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:35,820
Now remember...
stay... near... the house. Okay?

531
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,113
- I promise.
- Okay.

532
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:40,449
- All right.
- That's good. I want you to have a good time.

533
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:42,618
Thanks a lot, Uncle Red.

534
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,248
- Watch out for the werewolf!
- Bye.

535
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,414
All right.

536
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,846
This is for the good guys.

537
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,179
Oh, shit.

538
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,189
- Hello?
- <i>Uncle Red, it's me, Marty.</i>

539
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:25,067
- <i>I saw the werewolf last night.
- Oh, Marty...</i>

540
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:28,279
- <i>I saw the werewolf!</i>
- Hey, buddy, you had a bad dream.

541
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,365
<i>It wasn't a dream, Uncle Red.
I saw the werewolf with the fireworks.</i>

542
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:34,535
There are no such things as werewolves.

543
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:37,913
<i>There is, I saw it!
Uncle Red, it was a werewolf.</i>

544
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:40,082
Have some pity on your poor uncle, okay?

545
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,084
<i>Uncle Red, I saw it!</i>

546
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:44,753
Jesus...

547
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,257
- What?
- Who was that?

548
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:51,594
Obscene phone call.

549
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:57,391
Marty, you okay?

550
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:00,728
You've just been sitting here all morning.

551
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:03,606
Where's Mom?

552
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,941
Out shopping. Why?

553
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:07,818
Jane, I gotta talk to you.

554
00:58:09,487 --> 00:58:11,197
About what?

555
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:17,661
Well, Uncle Red won't believe me,
and if you don't help me...

556
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,873
What is it?

557
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:30,257
<i>He told me something unbelievable.
Yet somehow, I believed most of it.</i>

558
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:37,515
<i>But I understood one thing completely,
Marty himself believed it all.</i>

559
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:52,488
<i>Marty had seen where
the rocket had struck home, he said.</i>

560
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:56,867
<i>And I went out that day looking for more
than just cans and bottles.</i>

561
00:58:56,951 --> 00:58:57,993
Hi, Mrs. Thayer.

562
00:58:58,077 --> 00:59:01,872
I'm collecting returnable bottles and
cans for the MEDCU drive.

563
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:04,833
I was wondering if you had any.

564
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:10,506
<i>I was looking for a man
or a woman with just one eye.</i>

565
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:11,799
Hello, Jane.

566
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:16,262
- Who is it?
- It's Jane Coslaw.

567
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:21,475
Hello, Jane.

568
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:32,736
I know what you're after, Jane,
and you're outta luck.

569
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:36,782
Little Toby Whittislaw come in here
yesterday, and I give 'em all to him.

570
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:38,826
That's okay.

571
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,641
Is that you, Mr. Fairton?

572
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:15,988
- Got any bottles or cans?
- No.

573
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:24,038
- Goodbye, Mr. McLaren.
- Bye, Jane.

574
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:25,706
Jesus...

575
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:36,550
Gentlemen...

576
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:39,428
I'm sorry to disturb your lunch.

577
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,513
I'm collecting bottles for the MEDCU drive.

578
01:00:41,597 --> 01:00:45,434
I was just wondering
if any of you had seen Mr. Robertson?

579
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:50,064
Oh, hi, Mr. Robertson.
I was wondering if you had any.

580
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:54,151
I guess not. Thanks.

581
01:00:55,569 --> 01:01:00,783
It's my own fault for believing Marty.
The little asshole.

582
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:10,292
Hi, Reverend Lowe.
I'm ready to turn my bottles in.

583
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,712
Hi, Janie. And how are you?

584
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:17,383
All right, I guess.

585
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:21,095
It's just that my brother
gets me so mad sometimes.

586
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:22,805
Well, Jane...

587
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:27,267
...little brothers sometimes do that.

588
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:31,271
Take your cart on around to the garage
and bring me your tally sheet.

589
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

590
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:12,873
Having some trouble?

591
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:29,223
Why Jane, you're trembling.

592
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:32,392
I don't feel well.

593
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:36,522
- I think maybe I got too much sun.
- Well, would you like to come in the parlor...

594
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:39,900
- ...and lie down for a bit?
- No!

595
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:44,446
Or have a cold drink? I have some soda.

596
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:46,824
I think I should get home
and help my mom with dinner.

597
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:49,117
- I'll give you a ride.
- No!

598
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:56,750
Give my best to your brother, Jane.

599
01:03:57,626 --> 01:03:59,002
I will!

600
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,970
Jeez... what did you do then?

601
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:12,349
I ran faster than I've ever run
in my entire life. What do you think?

602
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:16,019
By the time I got back here
I thought I was gonna faint.

603
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:20,649
Marty, what are we gonna do?

604
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,487
If we tell anyone...
grownups, I mean, they'd laugh.

605
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,116
Well, what are we gonna do?

606
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,286
I think I know.

607
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,599
<i>I mailed another letter
from Marty the next day.</i>

608
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,559
<i>A third the day after that.</i>

609
01:05:37,643 --> 01:05:41,647
<i>Then on Saturday we told
Uncle Red what we'd been up to.</i>

610
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:44,191
<i>His reaction was less than serene.</i>

611
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:47,319
Holy jumped-up, bald-headed, Jesus palomino!

612
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:50,030
- Uncle Red...
- From him, I'd expect it.

613
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:53,784
Sometimes I think your common sense
got paralyzed along with your legs.

614
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:56,995
But from you, Jane,
you're Miss Polly Practical!

615
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:58,330
You don't understand.

616
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:01,041
I understand that my niece and my nephew...

617
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:03,168
...are sending little love notes
to the local minister...

618
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,712
...suggesting that he gargle
with broken glass...

619
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:08,423
- ...or eat a rat poison omelet!
- It came for me.

620
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:11,218
I shot it in the eye,
now he's wearing an eye patch!

621
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:15,305
I wish I had a tape recorder
so you could hear what you sound like.

622
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:17,641
What about the baseball bat
Jane saw in his shed?

623
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:21,353
- What about it?
- You know who used to have a bat like that?

624
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:22,688
- Mr. Knopfler.
- So?

625
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:25,649
It looked like Bigfoot had used it
for a toothpick.

626
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,234
Do you wanna know what I think?

627
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:30,278
No, we just wanted to admire you.

628
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:35,409
You better watch your mouth right now.
You're on thin ice with me, son.

629
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:40,205
I think you had a hallucination.
The thing was probably a broomstick.

630
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:43,417
It was not! Want me to show you?

631
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,544
I'm not afraid!
I'll show it to you right now!

632
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:47,796
No, no, no, no, no.

633
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:51,049
I'm a little too old to be playing
"the Hardy Boys meet Reverend Werewolf"!

634
01:06:51,133 --> 01:06:54,011
- Jane, forget it.
- Jesus! Yeah, forget it. Forget it.

635
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:56,513
- Werewolf!
- Probably have gotten rid of it by now anyway.

636
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:58,932
This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

637
01:06:59,016 --> 01:07:01,184
Just forget it! It's crazy!

638
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:06,982
- You see your suspect yet, Marty?
- Yes, I see him.

639
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:10,652
Are you saying he took a rocket in the eye...

640
01:07:10,736 --> 01:07:13,030
...and now he's out here painting?

641
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:16,074
He'd be in the hospital or he would be dead.

642
01:07:16,158 --> 01:07:19,077
I didn't shoot him when he was...

643
01:07:19,161 --> 01:07:23,040
What? A werewolf? Oh, Jesus!

644
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,586
Jane, you don't believe this madness, do you?

645
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:30,464
I don't know exactly what I believe.

646
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:35,135
But I know that what I saw
was a baseball bat, and not a broomstick.

647
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:39,347
And I know there was something strange
about the way the garage smelled.

648
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:42,726
It smelled like an animal's den.
And I believe in Marty.

649
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:46,063
You used to believe in him too, Uncle Red.

650
01:07:49,191 --> 01:07:50,442
Kids...

651
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:41,326
Hey, Marty, you wanna go
to Robertson's for a soda?

652
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:43,703
No, thanks. I think I'm gonna go home.

653
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:46,873
- Okay, see you!
- Yeah. See you!

654
01:09:56,902 --> 01:09:58,403
Oh, shit!

655
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:00,739
Oh, my God!

656
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:08,163
Come on. Please!

657
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:10,749
Come on!

658
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:26,348
Come on! Come on!

659
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:40,607
Marty...

660
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:44,152
I'm very sorry about this, Marty.

661
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:46,905
I don't know if you believe that or not,
but it's true.

662
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:50,283
I would never willingly hurt a child.

663
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:53,620
Please... I won't tell anyone.

664
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:57,957
You should have let me alone, Marty.

665
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:00,460
I can't kill myself.

666
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:04,089
Our religion teaches
that suicide is the greatest sin...

667
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:06,758
...a man or a woman can commit.

668
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:09,552
Stella was going to commit suicide.

669
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:13,890
And if she had done so,
she would be burning in hell right now.

670
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:16,393
By killing her I took her physical life...

671
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:19,771
...but I saved her life eternal!

672
01:13:20,522 --> 01:13:26,903
You see how all things serve the will
and the mind of God.

673
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:30,949
You see! You meddling little shit!

674
01:13:31,783 --> 01:13:34,035
You're going to have
a terrible accident, Marty.

675
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:36,329
You're gonna fall in the river.

676
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:48,425
Mr. Zinneman! Help me, please! Help me!

677
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:52,679
Mr. Zinneman! Wait! Mr. Zinneman!

678
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:55,640
On the bridge! Help me, please!

679
01:13:57,976 --> 01:13:59,144
That you, Marty?

680
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:13,491
Spooky in there, isn't it?

681
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:22,584
It's easier to swallow without
the foaming jaws, the hair and teeth.

682
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:25,253
- Did you talk to the Sheriff?
- Yes.

683
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:29,257
After Marty's latest,
thrilling tale of wonder.

684
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:32,594
But he's had no complaints
of poison pen pals.

685
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:35,138
- See, told ya.
- Shut up, Marty.

686
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,254
What color is Lowe's car?

687
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,965
Blue.

688
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:15,303
This blue.

689
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:22,936
Jesus...

690
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:30,985
That is the craziest, goddamn story
I have ever heard in my life.

691
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,613
I know.

692
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:38,409
Do you believe any of this?

693
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:45,250
You do, don't you?

694
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:49,629
Well, let's just say I believe
Reverend Lowe oughta be checked out.

695
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:53,591
That can be arranged.

696
01:15:55,093 --> 01:15:56,803
Thank you, Joe.

697
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,569
Reverend Lowe?

698
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

699
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,539
Can I help you, Joe?

700
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,797
I think you'd better
come along with me, Reverend.

701
01:19:28,306 --> 01:19:30,516
It's not my fault!

702
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:07,303
Sheriff Haller said he'd check him out.
And guess what?

703
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:09,722
No one sees him again.

704
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:13,226
What do you suggest I do about it?

705
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:21,734
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.

706
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:35,081
You won't let go of it, will you?

707
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:40,294
- I saw what I saw.
- Marty, the moon wasn't even full.

708
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:46,050
In the legends, the werewolf guy
only changes when the moon is full.

709
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:49,387
But maybe he's like this almost all the time.

710
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:53,724
- Only, as the moon gets fuller...
- ...the guy gets wolfier.

711
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:55,935
- Shit...
- Here!

712
01:20:56,686 --> 01:21:00,648
- Take mine too.
- Why don't you guys tell me...

713
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:03,526
...how this guy Lowe became a werewolf?

714
01:21:04,819 --> 01:21:06,654
I don't know.

715
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:09,699
Maybe he doesn't know either.

716
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:13,327
I think he's going to come after me.

717
01:21:13,411 --> 01:21:16,622
Not just because I know who he is...

718
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:20,585
...but because I hurt him.

719
01:21:20,668 --> 01:21:24,547
And I think he'll wait till
the moon's all the way full...

720
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:27,717
...and there's no Reverend Lowe at all.

721
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:31,012
Only the monster.

722
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:38,644
You've gone right outta your mind.

723
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:41,898
Will you do it?

724
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:49,113
Boy...

725
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,616
Stay!

726
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:04,962
Hello.

727
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:10,968
My nephew has just
discovered the Lone Ranger.

728
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:13,721
And I wondered if you could help me here.

729
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:26,108
You want a silver bullet, huh?

730
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:32,949
<i>The man Uncle Red had gone to see
was more than a gunsmith.</i>

731
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:37,662
<i>He was, Uncle Red said,
"an old world craftsman ".</i>

732
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:40,748
<i>A sort of wizard of weapons.</i>

733
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:47,964
<i>He confirmed the high silver content
of my crucifix and Marty's medallion.</i>

734
01:22:48,047 --> 01:22:52,969
<i>He melted them down and
molded them into a silver bullet.</i>

735
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:10,820
<i>Marty had read all the legends
about werewolves.</i>

736
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:16,367
<i>And though they differed on several
minor points, they all agreed on one.</i>

737
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:25,084
<i>It takes silver to kill a werewolf.</i>

738
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:29,255
<i>And we were taking no chances.</i>

739
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:33,467
There it is.

740
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:37,638
Nicest piece of work I ever done, I think.

741
01:23:38,848 --> 01:23:43,811
It's got a low-grain load so it won't tumble.

742
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:50,276
- Oughta be pretty accurate.
- Well, shoot, it's just a gag.

743
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:58,117
I mean, what the heck you gonna shoot
a 44 bullet at anyway, made of silver?

744
01:23:59,994 --> 01:24:02,538
How about a werewolf?

745
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:09,253
<i>The night of the next
full moon came on Halloween.</i>

746
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:12,548
<i>And a happy coincidence left us
in the sole care of Uncle Red.</i>

747
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:15,634
Luggage for a month
going to New York for a weekend.

748
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:18,971
- <i>At least it seemed like a coincidence.</i>
- And remember, we'll be at the Plaza.

749
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:21,682
- And I've got the number.
- Right.

750
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:27,313
- Hey... goodbye!
- Bye!

751
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:29,607
- Goodbye, honey.
- Goodbye.

752
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:33,778
- Thank you! Thank you so much!
- Whoa, Sis.

753
01:24:33,861 --> 01:24:36,197
It's just my luck to win
a romantic trip for two...

754
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,157
...after Sheila leaves me. That's how it is.

755
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,367
- Have you got the tickets?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

756
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:42,995
- Okay, now go and have fun.
- Bye.

757
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:44,371
- Have fun, Bob.
- You too, Red.

758
01:24:44,455 --> 01:24:46,373
And don't let these kids run you ragged.

759
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:48,626
- Naw, they won't run me ragged.
- And listen.

760
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:51,420
Don't let any trick-or-treaters in,
even if they come.

761
01:24:51,504 --> 01:24:53,714
- We won't.
- We won't.

762
01:24:53,798 --> 01:24:55,091
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye!

763
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:57,009
- Bye-bye.
- Have fun.

764
01:24:57,093 --> 01:24:58,844
Oh, listen! You kids go to bed early.

765
01:24:58,928 --> 01:25:01,597
You're gonna hurt you head
poppin' in-and-out like that!

766
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,349
Be good, kids!

767
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:05,726
- Yeah, we will.
- Yeah, we will.

768
01:25:07,645 --> 01:25:10,648
- Could I tell you kids something? '
- Sure, Uncle Red.

769
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:15,361
Me and Nan, were just like you guys
when we were growin' up.

770
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:19,698
And the bitch of it is, we still are.

771
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:24,328
Did you really win a trip to New York
from Publisher's Clearing House?

772
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,038
No.

773
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:30,209
But the moon is full.

774
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,545
And your parents are gone.

775
01:25:33,254 --> 01:25:36,966
And I did win a subscription
to Popular Mechanics.

776
01:26:18,549 --> 01:26:20,134
Oh, God!

777
01:26:24,305 --> 01:26:26,974
You're gonna burn yourself up sometime
doing that Uncle Red.

778
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:28,100
Probably will.

779
01:26:29,185 --> 01:26:33,981
If that would have gone off,
that've been the end of our Silver Bullet.

780
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:36,942
This is too much.

781
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You guys are goin' to bed.

782
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:46,744
- But Uncle Red, you said...
- I know what I said.

783
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:49,496
But it's ten till three in the morning
and it's not coming.

784
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:52,791
- The moon's not down yet.
- Well, it's damn near down.

785
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:57,713
I'm gonna sit up the rest of the night
with this stupid gun in my lap...

786
01:26:57,796 --> 01:26:59,798
...because I promised I'd do that.

787
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:04,178
- But you're going to bed, so are you.
- What happens if I say no?

788
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:07,765
Then I'm gonna kick your ass!

789
01:27:11,018 --> 01:27:14,313
- It's a werewolf! I saw him! It's a werewolf!
- Wait, wait, wait!

790
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:17,858
- What did you see?
- The werewolf!

791
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:22,363
- What did you see?
- I was looking at you.

792
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:26,200
God damn...

793
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:31,205
Uh... it's okay. I'll go look, that's all.

794
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

795
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:10,286
A very familiar feeling
is beginning to come over me.

796
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:11,912
What?

797
01:28:17,876 --> 01:28:21,588
I'm beginning to feel like a horse's ass,
that's what.

798
01:28:21,672 --> 01:28:24,008
He's out there! I saw him!

799
01:28:24,091 --> 01:28:27,469
I know you did, Janie.
Why don't you just go upstairs?

800
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Now don't panic!
He's here.

801
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:46,322
Marty, it could be just a fuse.

802
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:57,207
Shit!

803
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:19,188
Over here! Watch out!

804
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:25,903
Jane, get the gun!

805
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:48,384
Hurry, Marty! Please, hurry!

806
01:29:57,643 --> 01:29:59,561
Leave him alone!

807
01:30:09,029 --> 01:30:11,073
Shoot! Shoot!

808
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

809
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:14,761
Holy jumped up Jesus Palomino.

810
01:31:15,429 --> 01:31:16,889
God...

811
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:36,366
It's okay. I gotcha. I gotcha.

812
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:40,329
Don't worry. He's dead.

813
01:31:43,165 --> 01:31:46,627
Are you all right?

814
01:31:48,587 --> 01:31:51,048
All except for my legs.

815
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:52,758
What?

816
01:31:54,927 --> 01:31:57,471
I don't think I can walk.

817
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,186
I love you, Jane.

818
01:32:07,898 --> 01:32:09,816
I love you, too.

819
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,947
<i>I wasn't always able to say that.</i>

820
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:17,991
<i>But I can say it now.</i>

821
01:32:18,992 --> 01:32:21,411
<i>I love you, too, Marty.</i>

822
01:32:21,495 --> 01:32:23,330
<i>Good night.</i>
