00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,372
I'm not gonna
suck your dick.

3
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,794
That's not what this is.

4
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,881
I don't do drugs either.

5
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,927
I'm just trying to help.

6
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,515
What about money?

7
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,476
You got any money?

8
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,897
No, I don't.

9
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,338
I thought you said
this was a shelter.

10
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,049
It is.

11
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,428
Looks like a house.

12
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,141
It used to be.

13
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,638
Let go.

14
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,033
Get the bucket.

15
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,395
Thomas.

16
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,027
Thomas.

There we go.

39
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,380
So now,
the other airplanes

40
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,424
will know where it is.

41
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,804
They're called beacon lights.

42
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,851
Can I keep it?

43
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,311
Try it.

44
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,407
What else you got?

45
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,408
I need you to go.

46
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,831
Can we talk?

47
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,223
Okay.

48
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,103
What do you wanna talk about?

49
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,801
That's it?

50
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,678
I can't sell this stuff.

51
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,681
There's like ten shirts
in there.

52
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:53,941
Thanks.

53
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,820
Does that thing still work?

54
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,382
What are you doing
after work?

55
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,929
Can I get you something
to drink?

56
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,724
I'll have water
and a sweet tea, no ice.

57
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,142
No ice.

58
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,060
- Water.
- Water.

59
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,979
- Water.
- Great.

60
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,438
We're ready to order.

61
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,357
Okay,
what can I get for you?

62
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,402
I don't know what I want yet.

63
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,822
Okay...

64
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,574
How's the Denver
Omelette?

65
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,261
Ah.

66
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,288
I'm sorry,
I thought it would fit.

67
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,292
It's okay.

68
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,340

78
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:08,010
There was a prostitute
working outside the diner today.

79
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,515
How do you
know she was a prostitute?

80
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,018
I've seen her before.

81
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:27,821
She'd actually be
a great catch.

82
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,284
She probably knows
a lot of people.

83
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,411
I doubt any of them
care about her.

84
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,959
Jessie, I don't know.

85
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:52,262
I don't think that I can keep
doing this.

86
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:56,558
He's our brother.

87
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:58,143
I know, I know.

88
00:16:58,227 --> 00:16:59,811
Then, what is it?

89
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,648
He's sick,

90
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,359
he's not getting any better.

91
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:11,156
We shouldn't be doing the
things that we're doing.

92
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,742
So what do you suggest we do?

93
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,334
I don't know.

94
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,016
Don't worry,
there's more food.

95
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,271
Everybody's hungry.

96
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,783
You gotta eat, guys.

97
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,256
Hey.

98
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,967
<i>Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>

99
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,030
I heard some kids playing
outside today.

100
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:39,990
When?

101
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,367
When it was bright out.

102
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,037
You're not supposed
to be awake at that time.

103
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,081
You know this.

104
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,672
Sorry.

105
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,718
Why were you awake?

106
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,681
'Cause they woke me up.

107
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,144
What did you hear?

108
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,652
Voices, and...

109
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,529
and...

110
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,697
yelling, and laughing.

111
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:27,162
Do you think
they're still out there?

112
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,002
Everyone's asleep by now.

113
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,757
We should get some
work done anyway.

114
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:52,312
Do you ever think about
going somewhere else?

115
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,651
I need to get some ice.

116
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,242
Why do you ask?

117
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:08,829
Just thinking.

118
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,831
About leaving?

119
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,211
Maybe.

120
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:17,713
Maybe?

121
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:20,549
Yeah.

122
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:29,850
Well, where would you go?

123
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,522
I've never been to the beach.

124
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:43,155
I went to Miami once
in the '90s.

125
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,531
Yeah?

126
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,283
It's nice.

127
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,495
It's not what it looks like
on TV.

128
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,124
What's it like then?

129
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:59,087
It's crowded, hot.

130
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:06,136
But you can be naked all day.

131
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,442
Here.

132
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,159
Did you break it?

133
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:31,828
No.

134
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:36,583
There.

135
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,302
What if we just left?

136
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,763
To Miami?

137
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:51,098
Anywhere.

138
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:53,934
We could...

139
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,311
We could get in my truck and...

140
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:00,816
Okay,

141
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,236
time's up.

142
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:10,158
Equals six

143
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:13,120
over two.

144
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,747
It's quicker, you could...

145
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:23,380
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,183
Okay, hands up.

147
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,365
1880.

148
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:51,742
- Mm-mm.
- No?

149
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,368
Try again.

150
00:24:57,748 --> 00:25:00,792
Oh, 1875.

151
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:16,892
Dwight?

152
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:22,648
Huh?

153
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,196
Where were you?

154
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:34,826
I went to the thrift store.

155
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:56,557
I don't know, 1950?

156
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:27,963
You okay?

157
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:31,258
Yes.

158
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:52,070
Are you gonna leave us?

159
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,322
What?

160
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:56,825
I don't know what I'd do
if you left.

161
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:02,539
I'm not leaving.

162
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,089
I know this is hard

163
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:14,176
but we can't do it
without you.

164
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:21,058
It has to be the three of us,
together.

165
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:27,689
Do you understand?

166
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:34,029
Tomorrow, you'll go out again.

167
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:39,409
Yes.

168
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:42,037
And don't take
so long this time.

169
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:45,749
Okay.

170
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,724
<i>You ready to order?</i>

171
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,481
<i>Hello?</i>

172
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:14,903
Can I get 10
breakfast burritos?

173
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:31,253
Where are you from?

174
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,052
Uh...
What country are you from?

175
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,346
I don't understand.

176
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,600
Oh, right.

177
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:48,979
What's your name?

178
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,816
Uh... "nombre".

179
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:55,027
My name?

180
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,111
Yeah.

181
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:58,363
Eduardo.

182
00:28:58,906 --> 00:28:59,907
Oh.

183
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:02,576
Dwight.

184
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:11,543
It's okay?

185
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,629
Yeah, it's okay.

186
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:16,632
It's good.

187
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:32,648
I just... have to get
something from the back.

188
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,210
Fuck.

189
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:46,638
Eduardo!

190
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:54,980
Eduardo.

191
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,329
Eduardo!

192
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:17,294
Eduardo, come out.

193
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:19,546
Goddammit.

194
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:28,305
Stop!

195
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,182
Please.

196
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:32,392
Don't kill me.

197
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:36,104
Look at me!

198
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,564
I'm begging you.

199
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:43,237
Please don't kill me.

200
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:46,698
What the fuck?

201
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,209
<i>Make sure you
mix well.</i>

202
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:59,294
<i>Then, you put in the oats
and blend.</i>

203
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,347
What are you doing?

204
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:12,683
What happened to your leg?

205
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,979
This'll hold him over
for tonight.

206
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,358
I'll go out again
in a couple of days.

207
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:23,777
- Jessie!
- I'll be back in a few hours.

208
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:26,446
You can't.

209
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,414
Jessie.

210
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:40,544
Wait, Jessie!

211
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:45,007
Wait!

212
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,739
Fuck, fuck.

213
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:12,594
I'll take room 117.

214
00:34:14,263 --> 00:34:15,639
Just one night?

215
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,391
Yeah, that's fine.

216
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:25,524
Hey, you don't have a wheelchair
I can borrow, do you?

217
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:12,946
It's fine, honey.

218
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,615
<i>Oh yeah?</i>

219
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:12,965
Hey.

220
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,552
Would you mind if
I used your bathroom?

221
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:18,720
Uh... my toilet's broken.

222
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:21,765
You look familiar.

223
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:24,601
Everybody tells me that.

224
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:29,189
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't an emergency.

225
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,942
Okay, come in.

226
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,111
Thank you.

227
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:38,866
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,698
Is this your blood?

229
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,376
<i>Dwight?</i>

230
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:51,999
I know it's messy
but I saved the blood.

231
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,007
What's wrong?

232
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,724
I noticed this
when she smiled.

233
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,002
I wonder how much it's worth.

234
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:06,193
<i>Stop, stop,</i>
<i>stop, stop.</i>

235
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,405
My sister's going to hear you.

236
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,367
That's a very bad thing.

237
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:18,163
Look, I wanna feed you

238
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:20,332
but you have to be quiet.

239
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:40,561
Sorry.

240
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:45,899
Here.

241
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,790
Let me go, asshole.

242
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:07,004
I won't tell.

243
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:10,007
I won't say anything.

244
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,925
I swear.

245
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:36,325
Who's this?

246
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:38,535
Is that your son?

247
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:40,621
Please let me go.

248
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:42,915
Your brother?

249
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:45,876
I don't even know that guy.

250
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:48,462
He was supposed to help me

251
00:43:49,755 --> 00:43:51,924
when I got to this country.

252
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:55,969
He never did.

253
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,232
And now...

254
00:44:09,942 --> 00:44:12,319
Look where I ended up.

255
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:16,114
Do you miss him?

256
00:44:16,698 --> 00:44:18,492
I'm cold.

257
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:22,746
What is "frío"?

258
00:44:29,086 --> 00:44:32,130
Well, okay.

259
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:01,326
I gotta get some ice.

260
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:06,290
I have this friend...

261
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:12,671
Had this friend, who was
always chewing on ice,

262
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:14,923
no matter how cold it got.

263
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:23,390
It was nice,
having someone to talk to.

264
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,983
People look so strange
when they're dead.

265
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:41,825
Please.

266
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:56,924
No, no.

267
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:00,177
I'm begging you.

268
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,012
I'm sorry.

269
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:13,398
Is Dwight gonna eat with us?

270
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:25,869
You know, I was thinking

271
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:28,997
maybe we could all
go out sometime.

272
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,418
Where would we go?

273
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:36,296
Anywhere.

274
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:40,259
I mean, I think it would
be good for all of us.

275
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:52,521
I was just telling Jessie

276
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:56,859
that I think we should all
go out somewhere together.

277
00:46:57,401 --> 00:46:58,694
I'm too tired.

278
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:01,572
Okay,
I can go with Dwight.

279
00:47:02,656 --> 00:47:04,825
There's no one out
at this time.

280
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:07,744
Not here.

281
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:08,829
Not anywhere.

282
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:11,331
No, that's not true,
that's not true.

283
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:13,750
It's three o'clock
in the morning.

284
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:19,756
I need friends.

285
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:24,261
- You have us.
- No, no real friends.

286
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:26,388
Not family, real friends.

287
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:28,098
You have no business
going out at this time...

288
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:29,516
I can make friends
with those kids

289
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,851
who are always outside.

290
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:32,769
I bet we'd be into a lot
of the same stuff.

291
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:35,272
Yeah, and where would
you find them right now?

292
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:40,485
Well, when tomorrow morning

293
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:42,237
when they're out there,
you or Dwight,

294
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:43,780
- you could go out and you can
- Can we talk about

295
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:45,282
tell them to come back
at night... Dwight.

296
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:46,366
something else?

297
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,702
Listen,
that's not happening.

298
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:50,621
Dwight, you could
tell them, right?

299
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:53,957
Right?

300
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:56,543
I don't know.

301
00:47:58,337 --> 00:47:59,379
You don't know.

302
00:47:59,463 --> 00:48:00,672
Hey.

303
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:06,428
I have a lot of things
to do tomorrow.

304
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:13,268
Okay, well...

305
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:14,269
No, Thomas.

306
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:15,812
No, what if we
just went around

307
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,397
for a little drive together,

308
00:48:17,481 --> 00:48:19,608
- all of us, on a little...
- No.

309
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:27,241
You never listen to me.

310
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:28,992
What?

311
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,871
You never listen to me.

312
00:48:32,955 --> 00:48:34,998
- That's not true.
- That is true!

313
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:36,959
Lower your voice.

314
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:45,801
Eat your food.

315
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:52,266
Jessie, please.

316
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:55,102
Don't.

317
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:15,998
Do you have any idea
what we do

318
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:17,916
to get that blood?

319
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Do you have any idea
how stupid you are?

320
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:48,947
I don't wanna live like this.

321
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:50,908
We have to.

322
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:57,122
Oh, we have to.
We have to.

323
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:03,712
I don't...

324
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:06,006
I don't wanna be sick.

325
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,144
Take me outside.

326
00:50:22,064 --> 00:50:24,483
- It's late.
- I don't care.

327
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:18,829
<i>So healthy, too.</i>

328
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:21,415
<i>It's a good idea to keep
your pantry full of them,</i>

329
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:22,791
<i>just in case
you get a craving.</i>

330
00:52:39,117 --> 00:52:40,244

<i>Oh my God,
that's right.</i>

350
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:16,168
Hey!

351
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:27,221
You're gonna get lost.

352
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:28,514
Yep.

353
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:43,445
I'm sorry about last night.

354
00:56:57,209 --> 00:56:59,753
Would you get me some blood?

355
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:04,800
Ready to order?

356
00:57:05,384 --> 00:57:07,886
Um...
Yeah, could I get the turkey

357
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:10,305
and Swiss toasted please?

358
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:13,725
Oh, and could we get
some of those chips?

359
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:15,727
No, sorry.

360
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:19,064
<i>They don't
just come with the meal?</i>

361
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:21,775
Only on Sundays.

362
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:26,488
The other girl always
just gives them to us.

363
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:35,414
You really should try smiling.

364
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:05,337
Holy shit.

365
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:08,131
Oh my God, oh my God.

366
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:49,631
Sorry to bother you,
excuse me.

367
00:59:49,715 --> 00:59:50,841
<i>Yeah.</i>

368
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:52,885
Do you know how to
get to Murray from here?

369
00:59:52,968 --> 00:59:54,845
<i>Murray, sure, sure.</i>

370
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:56,722
- <i>At the next intersection,</i>
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:58,182
<i>just make a left.</i>

372
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,058
<i>You'll be on 700 East.</i>

373
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:02,436
<i>That'll take you all the way.</i>

374
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:05,606
- Would you mind showing me?
- <i>What's that?</i>

375
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:09,401
Would you show me?

376
01:00:12,154 --> 01:00:14,031
- <i>Hey.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

377
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:16,783
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

378
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:23,207
Hey, I saw you
all earlier.

379
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,168
Do you wanna come in?

380
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:32,799
Hey, hey.
Hey, I'm Thomas.

381
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:37,804
I saw you earlier,
and I thought,

382
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:42,434
I thought you guys
wanna come over?

383
01:00:45,395 --> 01:00:48,899
Hey, what took you so long?

384
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:02,246
Are you okay?

385
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:07,626
What was that about earlier?

386
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:14,675
Oh, I was just playing
with my brother.

387
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,973
And, uh... this?

388
01:01:29,565 --> 01:01:31,775
Where are all your friends?

389
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:38,699
Why do you have
Christmas decorations up?

390
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:48,041
Oh, it was just Christmas
a few days ago.

391
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:51,044
It's April.

392
01:01:56,675 --> 01:01:58,802
Would you like
to come inside?

393
01:02:03,098 --> 01:02:05,475
So you get gifts in April?

394
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:07,144
<i>Every month.</i>

395
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:10,731
That's pretty cool.

396
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:31,877
Did you go to West High?

397
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:33,879
No.

398
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:37,674
I learn here at home.

399
01:02:40,302 --> 01:02:42,930
Are you sick or something?

400
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:48,018
I just...
I've never met someone

401
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:50,103
who's homeschooled before.

402
01:02:52,814 --> 01:02:55,108
Trust me,
you're not missing much.

403
01:03:02,032 --> 01:03:03,909
Would you like to play a game?

404
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,914
Yeah, sure.

405
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:11,959
Sit.

406
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,515
I'll play a song.

407
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:28,392
You have to tell me

408
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:30,727
what year you think
it was written.

409
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:32,020
Okay.

410
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:34,189
Okay, hands up.

411
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:36,775
Why?

412
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:40,654
Because you have to have
your hands up.

413
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:00,757
I don't know.

414
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:02,843
I don't really know
music, man.

415
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:09,558
So are your parents home?

416
01:04:25,574 --> 01:04:26,867
What is that?

417
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:28,994
Try it.

418
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:40,839
What are you
doing in here?

419
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,177
- No, Dwight.
- Who are you?

420
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,845
Dwight, please...

421
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:54,353
Answer me!

422
01:04:54,436 --> 01:04:56,271
I don't know,
he invited me in.

423
01:04:56,772 --> 01:04:58,315
That's true.

424
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:05,322
Don't move.

425
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:11,745
You shouldn't be in here.

426
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:13,330
No, let him...
Let him go.

427
01:05:13,413 --> 01:05:14,414
No.

428
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:20,420
Who is he?

429
01:05:21,255 --> 01:05:22,381
I...

430
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:24,091
Who is he?

431
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:28,178
He's my friend.

432
01:05:38,856 --> 01:05:40,107
Go to the living room.

433
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:42,693
- No, Dwight, I...
- Now!

434
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:14,183
How did you get here?

435
01:06:14,266 --> 01:06:15,434
My bike.

436
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:22,149
Come on.

437
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:25,277
Stay on the main roads...

438
01:06:27,571 --> 01:06:28,947
Fuck.

439
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,284
Be quiet.

440
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:50,928
Now, we don't
have to go out for a while.

441
01:06:56,225 --> 01:06:57,768
You gonna help me this time?

442
01:06:57,851 --> 01:06:59,311
Huh, yeah.

443
01:07:01,772 --> 01:07:02,898
Who spilled that?

444
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:04,691
Huh, oh.

445
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,072
We shouldn't waste it.

446
01:07:14,952 --> 01:07:16,495
No, no, no.
Jessie, wait!

447
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:20,707
Don't open that door.

448
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:37,558
- Jessie?
- Get out!

449
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:39,393
<i>Go get him.</i>

450
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,645
No, we have to get you
to the hospital.

451
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:42,896
Get him.

452
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,815
- We have to go.
- Dwight.

453
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:46,191
I'm not leaving!

454
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:49,778
Go get him, kill him.

455
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:53,949
- I can't.
- Listen to me.

456
01:07:54,032 --> 01:07:56,034
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

457
01:07:57,953 --> 01:07:58,912
If you let that kid go,

458
01:07:58,996 --> 01:08:01,206
that's the end of us,
that's it.

459
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:03,208
Do you understand?

460
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,003
Go!

461
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:01,725
Is that your dad?

462
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,520
Yeah.

463
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:09,149
Is it just the two of you?

464
01:09:14,154 --> 01:09:15,613
Yeah.

465
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:24,540
I know what
it's like.

466
01:09:33,131 --> 01:09:34,758
To be alone.

467
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:47,229
You know what'll happen
if we see each other again.

468
01:09:54,236 --> 01:09:55,445
Go.

469
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:26,143
I'm cold.

470
01:10:40,866 --> 01:10:42,701
We shouldn't waste it.

471
01:11:05,098 --> 01:11:07,726
I'm sorry for being
mean to you.

472
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:16,568
We're friends, right?

473
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:19,530
Yes, of course.

474
01:11:29,248 --> 01:11:30,666
It's okay.

475
01:11:40,217 --> 01:11:41,426
No.

476
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:43,846
No, Jessie.

477
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:47,516
No, Jessie, no, no.

478
01:11:47,599 --> 01:11:49,101
No, don't go.

479
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:52,938
Don't go, Jessie.

480
01:11:56,275 --> 01:11:57,484
Don't go.

481
01:13:02,424 --> 01:13:03,425
Get off of her!

482
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:49,781
I'm sorry.

483
01:16:59,953 --> 01:17:01,163
Thomas.

484
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:05,959
I'm leaving.

485
01:17:08,921 --> 01:17:10,547
And I'm not coming back.

486
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:40,661
There you go,

487
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:42,412
can I get you anything else?

488
01:17:42,496 --> 01:17:44,164
Uh... No.

489
01:17:57,177 --> 01:17:58,136
<i>Come on.</i>

490
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,805
That's like more dirty
than funny.

491
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:01,974
Yeah, it is,
I told you it was awful.

492
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:03,058
<i>Yeah, but like...</i>.

493
01:19:49,081 --> 01:19:50,290
Thomas.

494
01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:54,169
Hey.

495
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:08,308
I thought you left.

496
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:12,354
No.

497
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:20,487
I thought you weren't
coming back.

498
01:20:31,707 --> 01:20:33,542
I'm here now.

499
01:20:38,964 --> 01:20:40,424
I'm here.

500
01:20:50,142 --> 01:20:53,103
I'm so sorry about Jessie.

501
01:20:58,734 --> 01:21:01,445
No, it's okay.

502
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:06,200
That's okay.

503
01:21:24,218 --> 01:21:25,969
Open the window.
