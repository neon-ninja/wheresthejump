1
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:03,662
Huh? You sure you got that?
Don't strain yourself.

2
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,279
Well, that's it.
Turned in my key.

3
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,182
Yep. No turning back now.

4
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,785
You still think
this is a good idea?

5
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,620
What, me driving this thing?

6
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,289
I told you, I'm more than
happy to let you drive.

7
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:33,225
No, this, moving in with you.

8
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,729
Having this baby.

9
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:41,800
Jessie, you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

10
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:44,570
I've been ready for this
for a long time.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I just remembered the weirdest
dream I had last night.

12
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,679
It's the last chance
to remove it.

13
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:31,450
A little more suction, please.
Can't see a thing in there.

14
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:39,391
It's skull. It's part
of the guy's skull.

15
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,330
Intertrochanteric fracture
in your hip.

16
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,867
Your left clavicle and
three ribs are shattered.

17
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:52,437
You've got compound fractures
in your right and left tibia.

18
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,439
Good news is you will walk again

19
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,909
within three or
four months of therapy.

20
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,810
My baby?

21
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,916
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,668
I know it's been a long
haul for you, Jessie.

23
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,305
But we'll still need to send a
physical therapist to you at home.

24
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:30,209
Can someone come pick you up?
Your mother or father?

25
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:33,212
Uh, my mom died of cancer
when I was a baby,

26
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:37,516
and my father gave me to my aunt
to be raised after my mom died.

27
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,785
I haven't seen him in years.

28
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:42,788
Miss Laurent, can he come
here to pick you up?

29
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,468
Dad?

30
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,552
Thanks for picking me up, Dad.

31
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,971
Hmm. Glad I could help.

32
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,093
Sorry about your boyfriend.

33
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:07,793
This was your mother's room.
You're gonna have to stay in here.

34
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,896
The other bedrooms are upstairs.

35
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,072
Let's get you in bed.

36
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,503
When your aunt passed away, they
gave me some things you had there.

37
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,671
Clothes.

38
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,984
You hungry? I could make you
a sandwich or something.

39
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,719
Uh...

40
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:44,623
No, I'm fine. Just tired is all.

41
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:53,098
Oh, yeah, the water out of the
tap sometimes comes out bad.

42
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,801
You just let it run a
little, it'll clear up.

43
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,034
Preston.

44
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,940
Dad?

45
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,242
You here?

46
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,268
Oh, my word.

47
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,435
Thank you, Mama.

48
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,218
Ahh!

49
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,041
<i>Hello, Jessabelle.</i>

50
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,310
Mom.

51
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,379
<i>I went back and forth 100 times</i>

52
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,047
<i>whether or not
this was a good idea.</i>

53
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,216
<i>Making these tapes.</i>

54
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,318
<i>But as you can see, here I am.</i>

55
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:26,658
<i>It is March 14, and it is 1988,</i>

56
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,561
<i>and I am seven months
pregnant with you.</i>

57
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,536
<i>I love you, Jessabelle.
I love you.</i>

58
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,175
<i>If you're watching this,</i>

59
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,979
<i>it means I'm gone.</i>

60
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:51,215
<i>But I don't want this
to be a day of sadness.</i>

61
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,151
<i>I want it to be
a day of happiness.</i>

62
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,253
<i>So I'm not even
gonna talk about me.</i>

63
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,621
<i>The only thing that's important</i>

64
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,724
<i>is that you know
that I love you.</i>

65
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:04,662
<i>And that I have been
watching over you, always.</i>

66
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:09,567
<i>Okay. So, enough
of that sad shit.</i>

67
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,602
<i>I told your father
that I wanted him</i>

68
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,439
<i>to give you this tape
on your 18th birthday.</i>

69
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:19,010
<i>So for you, it is 2006.</i>

70
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:22,246
<i>Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday, baby!</i>

71
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,316
<i>I thought about having a cake,</i>

72
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,985
<i>but explaining all
this to Mrs. Davis</i>

73
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,153
<i>just would have been
a little too weird.</i>

74
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,522
<i>Uh, Mrs. Davis is our cook,</i>

75
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,992
<i>and if she's there, could
you tell her I said hi?</i>

76
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:38,730
<i>She's so sweet. That ought
to freak her out, though.</i>

77
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:41,165
<i>She is scared of ghosts.</i>

78
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,367
<i>Whoo-oo-oo!</i>

79
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,604
<i>Anyway, um, I wanted
to make this tape</i>

80
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,741
<i>because I wanted you
to get to know me.</i>

81
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:53,211
<i>And I wanted to give
you a birthday gift,</i>

82
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,446
<i>a birthday reading
with my cards.</i>

83
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,515
<i>I am really good at this.</i>

84
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,220
<i>I'm always right.</i>

85
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,056
<i>You can't cut the deck,
so this will have to do.</i>

86
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,191
<i>Here we go.</i>

87
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,262
I still have your bracelet, Mom.

88
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,633
<i>Okay. So this is Death.</i>

89
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:21,072
<i>But it doesn't mean "death" death.
It means transition.</i>

90
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,241
<i>And this year, your 18th year,</i>

91
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,763
<i>is gonna be
a year of transition.</i>

92
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,749
<i>You know what it says here? It says
that you've never left St. Francis</i>

93
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,085
<i>and that you're
never gonna leave.</i>

94
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,788
<i>Baby, you've gotta get out
there and see the world.</i>

95
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,824
<i>There's so much
great stuff out there.</i>

96
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:44,295
<i>Suits of Cups. That's the water
sign, and water is pragmatic.</i>

97
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,663
<i>It goes the way
of least resistance.</i>

98
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,765
<i>But this is a lot of water.</i>

99
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:51,803
<i>Are you a swimmer, or do you
do something with the sea?</i>

100
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,838
I can't even swim.

101
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,507
<i>You're a homebody,
just like your mama.</i>

102
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,343
Wrong again.
You're terrible at this!

103
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:02,246
<i>Well, it says here
that you're not alone.</i>

104
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,616
<i>That there is a presence
in the house with you.</i>

105
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:09,454
<i>It's not a bad thing. There are
guardian angels everywhere.</i>

106
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,658
<i>Maybe I'm seeing me.</i>

107
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,293
<i>Uh!</i>

108
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,595
<i>Yes, so she's a she.
It's a female.</i>

109
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,435
<i>Um...</i>

110
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,704
<i>She wants you out of the house.</i>

111
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>She says it's hers.</i>

112
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,717
Jesus, Dad! You scared
the shit out of me!

113
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,886
Where did you get that?

114
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,857
I asked you a goddamn question!

115
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,358
I said, "Where did
you get that?"

116
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,594
I found it in my room,
in Mom's room.

117
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,524
Don't, Dad! Don't!
What are you doing?

118
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,337
Dad, what are you doing?

119
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,773
Oh! No, Dad. Oh, God, Dad.

120
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,143
No more snooping around.

121
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,452
Dad? Dad?

122
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,400
Dad.

123
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,241
Dad!

124
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,181
Dad.

125
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,679
<i>It's past your bedtime, sweetie.</i>

126
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:18,809
<i>That there is a presence
in the house with you.</i>

127
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,360
Who are you?

128
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,499
Jessabelle.

129
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,538
I made breakfast.

130
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,416
Look, I'm sorry
about last night.

131
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,619
I was a little drunk. It's
not gonna happen again.

132
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:43,788
It's all right.

133
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,800
That was your
mother's old chair.

134
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,497
It was out in the shed.

135
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,807
Didn't expect to see
your mother last night.

136
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:05,930
That tape, I didn't know
she made that tape,

137
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,014
that she actually
went through with it.

138
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,028
You just found that one tape?

139
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,864
Uh-huh, just one.

140
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,692
<i>Hello, Jessabelle.</i>

141
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,695
<i>I love you.</i>

142
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,565
I love you too, Mom.

143
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:37,601
<i>It's been three weeks
since our last reading.</i>

144
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:43,040
<i>There was so much weird stuff in
there, so I asked Moses about it.</i>

145
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,109
<i>Not Ten Commandments Moses,</i>

146
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:49,947
<i>but my friend Moses from my
church on Jerry's Creek.</i>

147
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:52,550
<i>Don't tell Dad. He'd kill me.</i>

148
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,195
<i>Moses taught me
how to read cards.</i>

149
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:09,833
<i>So I showed him your reading, and
he said something interesting.</i>

150
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:15,239
<i>He said that the two presences
in the house, the two females,</i>

151
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,074
<i>they're both you.</i>

152
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,845
<i>You've been having
nightmares, right?</i>

153
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:26,784
<i>And when you see it, this
presence, it's broken, right?</i>

154
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:29,787
<i>It's a demon,
but it's an inner demon.</i>

155
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:33,123
<i>You were in some sort of
accident or something,</i>

156
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,993
<i>or maybe somebody you know was.</i>

157
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:40,731
<i>Now, I want you to listen to me.
It wasn't your fault.</i>

158
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:46,670
<i>Stop blaming yourself, sweetheart.
It wasn't your fault. Okay?</i>

159
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:50,174
<i>Now that we know that's what
that last reading meant...</i>

160
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:52,610
<i>I mean, that's what Moses says.</i>

161
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:55,913
<i>So, we're gonna
get you a new one.</i>

162
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:57,314
<i>All right.</i>

163
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:05,356
<i>Death. That means transition. You
really don't have to worry about that.</i>

164
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,637
<i>I see a very horrible death.</i>

165
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Dad?

166
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,821
Miss Laurent?

167
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:13,857
I was knocking, but I know
you're in a wheelchair,

168
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,126
so I got in.

169
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:18,896
Hi. It's just Jessie.

170
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,231
Uh, the hospital told you
I was coming, right?

171
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:25,235
Uh, no. Um, yes. Yes.

172
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:26,770
Oh.

173
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,972
You must be Miss Arlenna.

174
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:31,408
Rosaura.
You can call me Rosaura.

175
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,444
It's great to meet you.

176
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:34,878
Let's get started.

177
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:42,886
Okay. Okay. You feel good?

178
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,025
I'll be back and
check on you, okay?

179
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,108
Mmm-hmm.

180
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

181
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,520
No, no!

182
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,931
No, no!

183
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:20,477
What the hell's going on?

184
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,952
Just calm down. Settle down.

185
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:31,434
It's nothing. It's nothing.

186
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,097
Where the hell were you? Huh?

187
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:43,300
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Mr. Laurent.
It was only five minutes.

188
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:45,435
Get out! Now.

189
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,238
I'm sorry. Get out!

190
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:54,344
What did you mean by "nothing", Dad?
What's nothing?

191
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,412
What are you doing?

192
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,649
It's her goddamn tapes!

193
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:00,984
She's got you scared out of your mind.
I told her not to do this.

194
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:04,354
But, Dad, it's Mom.
It's all I have of her!

195
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:07,024
That thing on these tapes
is not your mother.

196
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,460
Five weeks into her pregnancy,

197
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,396
we found out she had
tumors in her brain.

198
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,600
She wouldn't do chemo.
Nothing to help herself.

199
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:20,570
It ate her mind, the cancer.
It just wasn't her anymore.

200
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,140
But, Dad, I want to watch them!

201
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:26,610
Why? So she can scare the
shit out of you some more?

202
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,446
I'm gonna burn these tapes.
Dad, no!

203
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,582
No, Dad! Don't, Dad! Dad!

204
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,435
Dad.

205
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:33,110
Oh, God!

206
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,185
Dad! Dad!

207
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,391
Jessie!

208
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,160
Jessie!

209
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,197
No! Dad!

210
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,332
Dad!

211
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,746
Goodbye, Leon. May your soul
finally find peace. Amen.

212
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,731
Hey, Jessie.

213
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,167
Preston.

214
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,204
How you been?

215
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,839
Uh...

216
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:38,275
That was a really
stupid question.

217
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:41,545
I heard you were
in town last week.

218
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:44,548
I would have come over, but I
figured I should call first.

219
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,683
I tried you a few times,
but no one picked up.

220
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:50,320
I'm sorry. My Dad's
phone is upstairs,

221
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,721
and it's gonna be
a few more weeks

222
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:54,291
before I can walk
upstairs to answer it.

223
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:57,127
Right. I'm sorry.

224
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,762
It's really good
to see you, Preston.

225
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,832
It's good to see you, too.

226
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,519
I'm really sorry about your dad.

227
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,780
Jessie?

228
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,456
Jessie, you okay?

229
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,924
Hey.

230
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,561
Morning.

231
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:38,684
Good morning.

232
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,298
Uh...

233
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,333
You stayed here all night?

234
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,969
Yeah, well, I figured I'd stick
around, make sure you're okay.

235
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:51,208
Thanks. You didn't have to.

236
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:58,615
Well, I guess I should
get going home.

237
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,684
But I'd love to see
you again, though.

238
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,485
Be okay if I come
by some other time?

239
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,621
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

240
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:08,959
All right. You take care.

241
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:10,894
Uh, wait, wait.

242
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,699
Please don't go.

243
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,002
What?

244
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:21,838
If I don't talk to somebody,
I'm gonna go crazy.

245
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,473
Maybe I already am crazy.

246
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,976
Okay. I don't gotta go anywhere.

247
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,647
I'll stay right here. Thank you.

248
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:33,617
But you think we can get the
hell out of this place?

249
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:34,951
Kind of gives me the creeps.

250
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,354
Yeah.

251
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,963
Pretty much
everybody's still here.

252
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:51,635
Rick Foster just got back from Afghanistan.
But he's going back, I think.

253
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:54,838
He's still married to Shawna.

254
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,973
If I was married to Shawna,
I'd be going back, too.

255
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:02,646
Mary Kimball's been married
and divorced twice.

256
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:05,515
Twice? She's got three kids.

257
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,551
Lives in that new subdivision
over by the quarry.

258
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,059
The quarry.

259
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,961
So, the quarry's
still there, huh?

260
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,465
Yes, well, you know,
it is a big, giant hole.

261
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,900
You can't really move
a big, giant hole.

262
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:26,063
Smart ass. Cut me some slack.

263
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,471
Yeah.

264
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:32,042
Nothing's changed, really.
Marriages and mortgages.

265
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,780
I can see why you couldn't
get out fast enough.

266
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:38,581
Uh...

267
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,718
Preston, I'm so sorry.

268
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,323
Hey, you don't
gotta explain to me.

269
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:49,559
If I'd gotten into college, I would've
left this town and never looked back.

270
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,628
Never would have
given it a second thought.

271
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,398
That's not true. I thought
about this place a lot.

272
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,469
I missed you. I'm sorry
I didn't call more.

273
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,572
I just wanted a clean
breakaway, I guess.

274
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:05,742
But me leaving never had
anything to do with you.

275
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:08,011
It's okay. I understand.

276
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,616
How have you been?

277
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,391
Married.

278
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:24,361
Oh, uh...

279
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,563
Where did she think
you were last night?

280
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:29,599
Oh, I told her the truth.

281
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:32,369
I told her I was
with a Make-A-Wish kid.

282
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,413
So tell me what's going on.
Oh...

283
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,515
You seemed so scared back there.

284
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:50,053
Um, okay. I've been
having nightmares.

285
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,855
I've been having
really bad dreams,

286
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:55,417
and they're so real that
I think I'm going crazy.

287
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:04,467
I dreamed there's this girl.
She looks dead,

288
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:08,471
and she's trying
to get me, kill me.

289
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:12,108
And there's this man. It looks
like he's been burnt to death,

290
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,912
and he looks at me
like I did it.

291
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,782
Like whatever happened
to him, it was my fault.

292
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:21,818
Well, after everything
you've been through,

293
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,987
it would be weird if you weren't
having nightmares, right?

294
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,722
Have you thought
about seeing a shrink?

295
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:28,425
I can't afford it.

296
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:30,560
I mean, if I had
any money at all,

297
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:31,928
I wouldn't have come
home to live with Dad.

298
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,497
I'm flat broke.

299
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,132
And there are these tapes.

300
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:53,583
<i>Now that we know that's what
that last reading meant...</i>

301
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,218
<i>I mean, that's what Moses says.</i>

302
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,821
<i>So, we're gonna
get you a new one.</i>

303
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,160
I really don't think you should
be watching these anymore.

304
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:06,996
It's no wonder why you're
having nightmares.

305
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:08,531
It's not good for you.

306
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,500
Would you watch them
if it was your mom?

307
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:13,102
Your only chance
to get to know her?

308
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:16,840
Yeah, I would, but I'd wait,
wait until I was recuperated.

309
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:20,743
Not when I was still stuck in
this house where she died.

310
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:24,013
I mean, it's just weird.

311
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:27,183
And besides, she's wrong
more than she's right.

312
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:30,053
She said you never left
town, you love to swim.

313
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:31,588
She said Dad was gonna die.

314
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,122
No, she thought
you were gonna die.

315
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:36,025
She said 10 things
that were wrong,

316
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:39,596
and you picked one
that was almost right.

317
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:42,165
Jessie, she didn't predict
your dad's death.

318
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,967
She thought she saw your death,

319
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:46,369
and she was wrong
about everything.

320
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,641
Now, look, I've been
thinking about your dreams.

321
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:55,712
That girl you keep
seeing, it's you.

322
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:58,181
And the guy that
burnt in the fire,

323
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,884
you're having a nightmare
about your accident.

324
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:07,162
Shit, that's my wife. I'm
sorry, but I've gotta go.

325
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:13,730
Here. That's my work cell. It's
got my home phone number on it.

326
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:17,600
You call me any time,
day or night, all right?

327
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,649
Promise? Okay.

328
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,540
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

329
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,280
Thank you, Preston.

330
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:33,249
Yeah, of course.
Now you take care.

331
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:26,229
<i>This is beautiful
South Louisiana.</i>

332
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:32,769
<i>And here is the belle
of South Louisiana.</i>

333
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:38,374
<i>That's right. Here she is. I'm gonna
send this to Mr. Hugh Hefner,</i>

334
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:40,109
<i>and I'm gonna make me
some money on the side.</i>

335
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,111
<i>The most beautiful woman
in South Louisiana.</i>

336
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:44,347
<i>Bad.</i>

337
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,684
<i>- This is the family portrait.
- Wait a minute. Wait.</i>

338
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:50,186
<i>I might just send me some tapes
to that Mr. Hugh Hefner.</i>

339
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,055
<i>These bugs are eating my ass up!</i>

340
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:54,424
<i>- Let's see those feet.
- Where'd they go?</i>

341
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:56,059
<i>There it is.</i>

342
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:58,261
<i>Oh! There she is. Baby!</i>

343
00:44:58,263 --> 00:45:00,730
<i>Hey, baby, you can't improve perfection.
Look at that.</i>

344
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:02,031
<i>What are you doing?</i>

345
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,200
<i>Recording for posterity.</i>

346
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:07,170
<i>Those who don't remember the
past are doomed to repeat it.</i>

347
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:10,473
<i>Okay, well, let's go into the future.
Merry Christmas!</i>

348
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:12,775
<i>Merry Christmas! Yeah!</i>

349
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,844
<i>Now, listen, I want to
show you how to use it.</i>

350
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:17,113
<i>You just take it,
point it, and shoot it.</i>

351
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:20,083
<i>You got it? Okay, you got it?
Just hold it.</i>

352
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:22,452
<i>Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!</i>

353
00:45:22,454 --> 00:45:24,320
<i>Mrs. Davis, I think these
people are about ready to eat.</i>

354
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:25,988
<i>They're gonna eat the furniture</i>

355
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,490
<i>if we don't sit them
down and feed them.</i>

356
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:30,426
<i>I'm gonna do the thing.
What? Okay.</i>

357
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:32,748
<i>Let's work with this, okay?</i>

358
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:38,768
<i>Excuse me. Before you unwrap the
presents and get into some funky music,</i>

359
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,003
<i>I just wanted to take a little
second here to brag about something.</i>

360
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:44,073
<i>Oh, yeah, surprise.
How very unlike you, Leon.</i>

361
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:47,944
<i>Now wait a minute. Now wait a minute.
It has come to my attention</i>

362
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:53,282
<i>that my lovely, devoted
wife is with child.</i>

363
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:54,884
<i>I'm pregnant!</i>

364
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,423
<i>Raise your glasses and
toast to Leon and Kate!</i>

365
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,525
<i>Congratulations. I can drink.</i>

366
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:43,399
<i>You're already dead, Jessabelle.</i>

367
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,842
<i>You're already dead!</i>

368
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:17,033
Preston? I'm sorry. I know I
said I wouldn't call, but...

369
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:18,401
<i>Who is this?</i>

370
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,838
Uh...

371
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,842
It's Jessie, Jessie Laurent.
Who is this?

372
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

373
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,588
<i>Come closer.</i>

374
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,366
<i>Closer.</i>

375
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,245
<i>Yes.</i>

376
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,163
Hey. You all right?

377
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,034
Sam just told me
you called last night.

378
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:41,137
I'm all right. I'm so sorry.

379
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:44,040
I just got scared.

380
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,778
Everything okay at home?

381
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,021
Well, "okay" is stretching
it a bit, but I'm fine.

382
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,650
Well, I'm glad you're here.

383
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:57,813
All right. Well, tell
me what happened.

384
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,293
Oh, you see that, too?

385
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:05,361
Yeah.

386
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:11,200
What is that?

387
00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:14,162
I don't know. I think
somebody's out there.

388
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,773
There was somebody definitely
out there last night.

389
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:19,742
You think that old
boat still works?

390
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,744
Sure.

391
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:01,484
What is that?

392
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:04,587
Mmm. Some kind of
voodoo or something.

393
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:08,424
Half the cemeteries in this parish
are full of that kind of shit.

394
00:52:08,426 --> 00:52:10,866
But why would they
put it on our land?

395
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,937
Yeah, someone's definitely
been out here, all right.

396
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,576
That's pretty fresh.

397
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:13,756
What?

398
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:20,462
There's something down there.

399
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,332
What is that?

400
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:26,802
What are you doing?

401
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:29,244
This isn't my first
time in the bayou.

402
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:57,499
Hmm. That's weird.

403
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,627
That's my birthday.

404
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:33,139
Why would someone want
to spook you like this?

405
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,508
Or maybe that's
a real gravestone.

406
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,978
Maybe you had a twin
sister or something.

407
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:47,549
I never had a sister. And why
would we both have the same name?

408
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,919
I don't know. I've got cousins with
two Beauregards in their family.

409
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,823
They just like the name.

410
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:58,927
But who killed that chicken?
And who brings flowers?

411
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,825
Do you think there's
something under that stone?

412
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,707
All right.

413
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:15,444
I guess we'll go back to your house and
see what kind of tools you've got.

414
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,474
Uh!

415
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:29,618
You don't recall any mention of your
parents having another little girl?

416
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:32,721
Hmm.

417
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,825
Well, you were right to call us.

418
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,929
I suspect it was a stillbirth.

419
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:43,031
We'll run some tests,

420
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:46,168
find out if she was a relative of
yours based on your DNA sample.

421
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:50,472
Of course we have a sample of your
daddy already from his autopsy.

422
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:53,575
So we'll give you a call when we
find out who this infant was.

423
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:58,013
Thank you, Sheriff. We knew we
had to call you right away.

424
00:56:58,015 --> 00:57:03,018
Remind me again the nature of your
relationship with Miss Laurent.

425
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,261
We're old friends
from high school.

426
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,191
Y'all have a good night, then.

427
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,127
Thank you, Sheriff.

428
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:22,004
You know you can't
stay here, right?

429
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:24,287
I've got nowhere else to go.

430
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,576
Yeah, you do.

431
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,491
You all right? Yeah.

432
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,034
Hey, honey.

433
00:57:55,739 --> 00:58:00,242
Hey, Sam, this is Jessie.
Jessie, this is Sam, my wife.

434
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:05,914
It's almost 1:00 a.m.
I gotta work tomorrow.

435
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,983
Yeah, I know.

436
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,619
Um, this is my fault.
I'm so sorry.

437
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:12,788
I'm the one who dragged
him all into this.

438
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:15,471
We don't have an extra room.
Hope the couch is okay for you.

439
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,793
Yeah, it's fine.

440
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:19,795
I need to get to bed.

441
00:58:19,797 --> 00:58:21,063
Thank...

442
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,071
I'm sorry about that.

443
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:35,244
Undo these. Yeah.

444
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,719
Okay, now. Yeah, thanks.

445
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,291
All right.

446
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:51,760
Well, just let me know
if you need anything else.

447
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,031
Thank you.

448
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:58,534
Night.

449
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:17,920
I'm sorry for getting you
in trouble last night.

450
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:22,291
That's all right. That's
what old friends are for.

451
00:59:22,293 --> 00:59:26,762
You're just lucky you were asleep
when she left for work this morning.

452
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:28,764
I see.

453
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:31,166
Yeah. So why do you
wanna go to Woodbury?

454
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:34,169
Well, I think there's somebody who
might know who that baby girl is.

455
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:36,004
Do you remember
Scott Davis from school?

456
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:38,006
Yeah, I remember him.

457
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:42,110
His mom, Abbey, used to cook for my
mom and dad back before I was born.

458
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,880
Well, if she's still alive,
I'll take you there.

459
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,057
Excuse me, sir. Abigail
Davis live here?

460
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,760
Thank you.

461
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,737
Mrs. Davis?

462
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:14,142
Hey, Mrs. Davis.

463
01:00:14,144 --> 01:00:17,746
I used to go to school
with your son, Scott.

464
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:20,349
It's Preston. Remember me?

465
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,684
Me and Scott used to play
together when we were little.

466
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:26,321
You used to yell at us for jumping
off your garage. Remember?

467
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:34,229
Preston Saunders.

468
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:37,866
You're gonna break
your arm up there,

469
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:40,109
and I'm gonna laugh my ass off.

470
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:45,974
It's good to see you, Mrs. Davis.
It's been a long time.

471
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,411
There's someone else here to see you.
This is Jessie. Jessie Laurent.

472
01:00:49,413 --> 01:00:51,213
You used to cook for her folks.

473
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,350
Jessie Laurent?

474
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:56,718
Mmm-hmm.

475
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,356
Jessabelle!

476
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,339
Mrs. Davis.

477
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,111
God, is she all right?

478
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:24,746
What did she say?

479
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:26,248
I don't know.

480
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:29,751
She say, "Rain wet us, Mama."

481
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:32,988
"Sun dried us, Papa.

482
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:35,090
"The betrayers are evil."

483
01:01:35,092 --> 01:01:38,794
"Call down Djowou. Call down
Djowou will deal with them."

484
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:40,896
What's that mean?

485
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's an old song from Haiti.
They sing it to call the
spirits to possess someone.

486
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,593
Tell Moses Jessabelle
get what's coming to her!

487
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:56,111
You okay?

488
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,291
Goddamn voodoo shit.

489
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,729
I always hated Scott's mom.

490
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,767
Jessie, don't worry. It's
just some crazy old lady.

491
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:21,236
Probably says shit
like that all the time.

492
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,772
What does that mean "they call
the spirits to get possessed"?

493
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:25,440
On purpose?

494
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:27,683
Well, yeah. In voodoo,
possession ain't a bad thing.

495
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:29,811
What?

496
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:31,279
Yeah, it's part of
their ceremonies.

497
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:34,950
You call down the spirits,
and they possess you,

498
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:36,952
and you dance around.
That's what they do.

499
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:39,488
How do you know that?

500
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:43,058
You grew up here, too. There's
voodoo all around this place.

501
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,093
They really get possessed?

502
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:48,163
Well, that depends on who you ask.
I think it's like hypnosis.

503
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:50,532
You know, like faith-healing,
speaking in tongues.

504
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:52,267
If you're raised
to believe that,

505
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:54,002
that's what you're
gonna think is real.

506
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:57,139
Plus they've got drums going,
people dancing around.

507
01:02:57,141 --> 01:03:00,408
They rub blood on you.
You think you're possessed.

508
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:03,512
"Moses". She said, "Tell Moses."

509
01:03:03,514 --> 01:03:07,215
I don't know. Voodoo mixes all kinds
of religions, Catholic, African.

510
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:08,917
It's all the same to them.

511
01:03:08,919 --> 01:03:12,420
No, my mom knew a Moses.
She said that on the tape.

512
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:16,191
She learned tarot cards
from Moses at her church.

513
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:19,434
I think her church was somewhere
out near Jerry's Creek.

514
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,388
God damn it.

515
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,587
Well, I guess you get to see
my patented 175-point turn.

516
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:50,992
No, wait, wait, wait.
What's that?

517
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:20,422
"Moses Harper.
Born December 12th, 1952."

518
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:22,991
"Died June 12th, 1988."

519
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:34,102
"Legba, open the gate.
Legba, let Moses back in."

520
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:35,570
Get out.

521
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,914
I'm Preston.
This here is my friend...

522
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:51,258
Let's go, Preston. Look, now,
we don't want any trouble.

523
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:54,444
Hey! Stop it!

524
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,661
Wait!

525
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,631
- Preston, you all right?
- Go!

526
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:28,035
You're not coming back here.

527
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:31,192
Ever. There's no way.

528
01:05:31,194 --> 01:05:32,460
Preston...

529
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:34,095
You're not gonna stay here.

530
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:41,369
You go in. Get whatever you need.
You can stay with us again.

531
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:43,851
Your wife's gonna be
thrilled about that.

532
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,809
You could stay at my mom's.

533
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,014
My mom always liked you.
You know that.

534
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:59,054
She's still got
our prom pictures up.

535
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:01,623
That's another reason why
Sam's not so crazy about you.

536
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:07,595
She knows I still
think about you.

537
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:15,403
And she knows we're
probably gonna move on.

538
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:19,074
But you didn't do it, Jessie.
Not you showing up right now.

539
01:06:19,076 --> 01:06:20,716
It's just weird timing is all.

540
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:39,206
All right. I'm gonna
get you out of here.

541
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:43,531
Ready?

542
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:45,734
Yeah.

543
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,093
Excuse me.

544
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,733
All right, let's get you packed.

545
01:07:18,735 --> 01:07:20,101
Would you grab me that bag?

546
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:21,343
Yeah.

547
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:26,674
Here you go. Thank you.

548
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:30,145
I'll get this over here.

549
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:53,134
Preston?

550
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:58,640
All right. Be right back.

551
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,694
You ready? All right.

552
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

553
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,695
Preston?

554
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

555
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:50,585
Preston?

556
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:55,957
Oh! Preston!

557
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:15,877
Your boyfriend is in shock, but
his blood pressure is okay.

558
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:17,679
He should be fine
when he comes to,

559
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:20,448
but they're running him to the
hospital just to be safe.

560
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:24,852
He's not my boyfriend. We were
just friends from high school.

561
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:28,957
Miss Laurent, do you mind telling
me what the hell's going on here?

562
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:35,763
We don't have the results
back on the DNA yet.

563
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:39,567
But that infant we found,
we do know was a female.

564
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:42,303
The date on her gravestone
was probably about right.

565
01:10:42,305 --> 01:10:44,005
Well, then was she a stillborn?

566
01:10:44,007 --> 01:10:49,344
No, she wasn't. She was born alive.
They know that.

567
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:50,645
Then she was murdered.

568
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:52,914
What?

569
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,449
From the nature of the fractures

570
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:55,783
and the splintering
of the vertebrae,

571
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:57,819
it seems like somebody
just picked her up

572
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:01,022
and snapped her over his knee
like a piece of firewood.

573
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:08,870
She was murdered.

574
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:15,536
Miss Laurent, I don't know what
the hell is going on around here,

575
01:11:15,538 --> 01:11:19,540
but clearly, you are one
very frightened young woman.

576
01:11:19,542 --> 01:11:21,309
She doesn't want to hurt us.

577
01:11:21,311 --> 01:11:22,377
What?

578
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,480
She needs our help.

579
01:11:25,482 --> 01:11:27,849
Who? Uh...

580
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:31,819
Sheriff, would you mind calling
me when Preston wakes up, please?

581
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,025
All right.

582
01:11:37,027 --> 01:11:39,794
Please call me when you
know he's all right.

583
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:41,296
All right.

584
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:50,705
I know you were murdered.

585
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,985
What are you trying to tell me?

586
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:23,871
Who were you?

587
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:28,810
Please, I wanna help you.

588
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,555
Who are you?

589
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:44,826
<i>Jessabelle.</i>

590
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,736
What do you want from me?

591
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:06,013
Hello? Hello?

592
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:09,384
<i>It's Sheriff Pruitt.
Your boyfriend's come to.</i>

593
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:11,085
<i>He seems all right. I
thought you'd wanna know.</i>

594
01:13:11,087 --> 01:13:12,720
Oh, he's all right?

595
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,789
<i>The paramedics
said he should rest.</i>

596
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:17,759
<i>He won't even go to the
hospital for an exam.</i>

597
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:19,160
<i>He wants me to take him
back out to the house</i>

598
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:20,595
<i>to protect you from something.</i>

599
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:21,863
<i>Do you know what that is?</i>

600
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:25,166
Sheriff, I can barely hear you.

601
01:13:25,168 --> 01:13:29,904
<i>Miss Laurent, we also just got the
results back from the DNA test.</i>

602
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:34,142
<i>That deceased baby girl
that you dug up was black.</i>

603
01:13:34,144 --> 01:13:37,478
What did you say? She was black?

604
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:41,516
I don't understand. Does that
mean she was my half-sister?

605
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>They crossed your DNA with
your father's, with Leon's...</i>
What?

606
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:13,448
<i>That's you crying.</i>

607
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:22,857
<i>You're crying
'cause you're scared.</i>

608
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:26,761
<i>You don't know where you are.
You don't know who you are.</i>

609
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,197
<i>You don't know shit!</i>

610
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:40,074
<i>I'm gonna tell you who you are.</i>

611
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:42,777
<i>Because that's what
good mothers do.</i>

612
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:45,079
<i>Jessabelle, you're dead.</i>

613
01:14:45,081 --> 01:14:46,814
<i>Your father's dead.</i>

614
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:49,784
<i>Moses.</i>

615
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:26,053
<i>No, it's all gonna be
all right, isn't it?</i>

616
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:34,295
<i>I need you, sugar.
I need you. Good girl.</i>

617
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:40,101
<i>You're gonna come back. I'm gonna
hold the door open for you.</i>

618
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:50,978
<i>Jessabelle, you're gonna
get what's coming to you!</i>

619
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,933
The unwanted presence
in the house.

620
01:16:11,935 --> 01:16:14,302
<i>When you see it,
it's broken, right?</i>

621
01:16:14,304 --> 01:16:15,703
It wasn't the ghost. It was me.

622
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:25,313
<i>You were telling someone
else's fortune, weren't you?</i>

623
01:16:25,315 --> 01:16:28,249
<i>You know what it says here? It says
that you've never left St. Francis</i>

624
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:31,285
<i>and that you're
never gonna leave.</i>

625
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:33,754
Your real daughter, not me.

626
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:39,694
You gave your life
for Jessabelle.

627
01:16:39,696 --> 01:16:41,696
Didn't do chemo.

628
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:43,965
When the baby was born,

629
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:46,801
it wasn't Dad's.

630
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,681
No, no!

631
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:04,171
He killed her, didn't he?

632
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,801
<i>Moses taught me
how to read cards.</i>

633
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:26,207
Look at those.

634
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:28,709
<i>Don't tell Dad. He'd kill me.</i>

635
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:49,296
So Leon adopted a baby girl
to cover the crime?

636
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:54,035
A white girl, me.

637
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:08,683
Your church, Moses' church.

638
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:09,850
Get out.

639
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:13,954
They gave her the grave.

640
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,888
What do you want from me?

641
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:54,428
What can I do?

642
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:01,802
Moses.

643
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:12,279
What are you doing?

644
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:13,447
Payback.

645
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:16,350
What?

646
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:22,923
No! No.

647
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:24,992
It's not my fault!

648
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:27,762
Somebody!

649
01:19:29,832 --> 01:19:31,232
Help!

650
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:37,037
No! What do you want from me?

651
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:39,406
All Jessabelle wants
is what's coming to her.

652
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:47,214
Somebody! No! No!

653
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,818
Let me go!

654
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:02,563
What is... No, no, no!

655
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:05,366
No!

656
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:16,143
Please don't.

657
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:19,046
Where are you taking me?

658
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:23,017
No, God! Please.

659
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:29,089
Please!

660
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,064
Jessie!

661
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:41,335
Please! Help me!

662
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:48,876
No! God!

663
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,542
Oh, my God! Hold on. Hold on.

664
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,649
You all right?

665
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:39,687
I thought I lost you.

666
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:58,005
Take me home, my love.

667
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,995
Miss Laurent? Are you all right?

668
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:24,732
Miss Laurent!

669
01:23:24,734 --> 01:23:26,700
It's Jessabelle.
