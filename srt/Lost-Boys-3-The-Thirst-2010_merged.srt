1
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,959
As soon as you feed, Senator,
you won't need these anymore.

2
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:23,879
Holy shit!

3
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:27,348
It's the attack of Grandpa Munster!

4
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,260
Gross.

5
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,721
Damn it.

6
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,460
Sorry to ruin your party, Senator.

7
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,360
Don't worry,
we'll have you out of here in two minutes.

8
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,563
- Thank you.
- Edgar! Aah!

9
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,770
Alan? Alan!

10
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,243
Alan!

11
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,012
Alan.

12
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,119
Alan. Alan, are you okay?

13
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,464
No. No, Alan, no. No, Alan!

14
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,657
Alan!

15
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,599
I am a vampire.

16
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:22,732
Oh, yeah?
Well, abracadabra. I'm an umpire.

17
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,245
Hocus pocus.

18
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:33,113
Mr. Frog?

19
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:35,446
Yeah?

20
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,221
Were you sleeping?

21
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,623
I work nights.

22
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:42,729
- Apparently not hard enough.
- Hmm.

23
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,489
You're in default on your loans...

24
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,134
...and the bank is repossessing
this property.

25
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,264
This would include any...

26
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:51,268
...structure currently
on the property as well.

27
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,404
- Are you serious?
- You have one week to vacate.

28
00:02:57,913 --> 00:02:59,937
Have a good day.

29
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:04,144
Fucking vampires.

30
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:31,566
Cash or store credit?
Cash.

31
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:36,631
Comes to 65 even.

32
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:38,241
Sixty-five dollars?

33
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,141
Are you kidding me? I mean, this issue
of Destroy All Vampires number 125...

34
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:45,112
...in nearly mint condition
is worth 50 bucks alone.

35
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:47,081
In near-mint condition.

36
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,421
I know near-mint condition
and that ain't it.

37
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,822
What are you talking about?
I haven't even opened this book.

38
00:05:54,993 --> 00:05:57,860
It's been boarded and bagged
since the day I got it.

39
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,191
Well, let's have a look.

40
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:03,767
There are stress marks
at the staple points.

41
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:07,634
The, uh, cover has lost at least 15 percent
of its gloss...

42
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:09,331
...the pages are yellow...

43
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:11,909
...and there's significant
rubbing and fading at the corners.

44
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:13,102
Hmm.

45
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,839
Now, if you were willing to part
with that Batman number 14...

46
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:19,541
...I, uh, might be able
to do a little bit better.

47
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:20,913
That's not gonna happen.

48
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:23,885
Happens to have
some sentimental value to it.

49
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:25,319
That's my offer, Frog.

50
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,220
Take it or leave it.

51
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,494
All right, pay me.

52
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:35,225
Have a nice day.

53
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:38,064
I hate happy people.

54
00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:42,165
- Hmm.
- Hey, Edgar.

55
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:44,174
Did you make any money off of Frank?

56
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:48,013
Are you kidding?
He gave me 65 bucks for everything.

57
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:50,445
Ugh. He's such a cheapskate.

58
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:51,743
Here, let me see.

59
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,545
Uh, not that one.

60
00:06:57,624 --> 00:06:59,752
But there's still some good stuff in here.

61
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:02,918
You want me to put it up on eBay,
see what I can get?

62
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:06,865
Uh, sure, why not.

63
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:09,298
Every little bit helps right now.

64
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,438
Where do I find the graphic novels?

65
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:12,936
You mean comic books.

66
00:07:13,107 --> 00:07:16,270
No, I mean graphic novels.

67
00:07:16,443 --> 00:07:18,673
I don't read comic books. I'm not a geek.

68
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:21,508
Hmm.
- Oh, well, I can't help you then.

69
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:24,048
Here at the Book O'Neer, geek is chic.

70
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:26,584
- Try Barnes & Noble.
Whatever.

71
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:29,279
I guess you don't want me
to spend any money here.

72
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,724
That guy gets on my last nerve.

73
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:38,126
- You know him?
- By reputation only.

74
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:40,466
His name is Jonny Trash.

75
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:42,295
He's a celebrity blogger.

76
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:44,700
What the hell is he doing here
in San Cazador?

77
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:47,967
- They're here for the X-Party.
- The X-Party?

78
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:50,202
- What's that?
- A rave.

79
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:51,606
And it's gonna be here?

80
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,213
If you believe the rumors.

81
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:57,249
But they're not telling anyone where
it's gonna be until the night of the event.

82
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,647
Great.

83
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,278
Sounds like the final nail in my coffin.

84
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,484
What...?

85
00:08:09,964 --> 00:08:11,125
Bye.

86
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:24,240
Oh, shit!

87
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:31,845
Who the hell parked...?

88
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,044
My truck.

89
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:37,681
You sure don't look like a cold-blooded,
meaner-than-hell, badass vampire killer.

90
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,521
Excuse me?

91
00:08:39,695 --> 00:08:41,492
You're Edgar Frog.

92
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:45,600
Sworn enemy to nightcrawlers
and bloodsuckers the world over.

93
00:08:47,002 --> 00:08:48,492
I'm sorry, lady.

94
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:51,105
You must have me confused
with somebody else.

95
00:08:51,273 --> 00:08:52,831
I'm Gwen. Gwen Lieber.

96
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:59,812
- Hi.
- And there is no confusion.

97
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:02,382
You are the same Edgar Frog
that destroyed covens...

98
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:06,749
...in Santa Carla, Luna Bay
and in Washington, D.C.

99
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,386
I have no idea what you're talking about.

100
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:16,299
Can we go inside to talk?

101
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:21,496
You got two minutes.

102
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:26,900
It's my brother, Peter.

103
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:29,011
He's been kidnapped.

104
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:32,772
A couple of years ago,
he started getting into trouble.

105
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:35,144
He was hanging out
with all the wrong kind of people.

106
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:36,410
Hmm.

107
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:42,389
And three weeks ago,
he went to Ibiza to this rave party thing...

108
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:43,992
...and he disappeared.

109
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:02,739
He started following around
this guy, DJ X.

110
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,081
He throws these events called X-Parties.

111
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:09,449
Yeah, I've heard of him.

112
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:18,184
Hi.

113
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:21,722
The same people
that are throwing this party...

114
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,800
...are throwing similar parties
all over the world.

115
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:29,599
And at these raves,
they're handing out this new designer drug.

116
00:10:29,774 --> 00:10:33,267
It's called the Thirst.

117
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:36,675
- It comes in little ampoules like this one.
Why would I care about...

118
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:39,646
...a bunch of drug addicts
with glow sticks?

119
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:41,718
Because the Thirst is not a drug.

120
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,124
It's vampire blood.

121
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:24,692
Nobody has seen him since.

122
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:29,658
Edgar, they are using these raves
to breed an army of vampires.

123
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:32,236
They're creating
their own global pandemic.

124
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:35,033
They've already infected hundreds
in Spain.

125
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,665
Done the same in Thailand, Rio
and in Greece.

126
00:11:38,844 --> 00:11:41,370
And now the rumors say
that they're on their way here.

127
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:46,884
I'm not interested.

128
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:50,047
Look, I would obviously pay you
for your trouble.

129
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:54,284
And this could well be the last time that
you would have to do something like this.

130
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,189
All of my research suggests...

131
00:11:56,362 --> 00:12:00,822
...that the Thirst is made from the blood
of the head vampire.

132
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,798
- The head vampire.
- The bloodsucking alpha.

133
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,699
- The alpha.
- From the Greek, "root"...

134
00:12:05,873 --> 00:12:06,964
...meaning the first.

135
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:10,137
The original.

136
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,735
I knew that.

137
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,717
I'm still not interested.

138
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:23,614
And your two minutes are up.

139
00:12:26,994 --> 00:12:29,792
I'm staying at the Hotel Cazador.

140
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:34,762
I truly hope that you'll reconsider.

141
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:39,933
I know you couldn't save your brother...

142
00:12:40,307 --> 00:12:43,470
...but, Edgar,
maybe you can help me save mine.

143
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,742
Hmph.

144
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:08,558
Go and check on our guest, would you?

145
00:13:20,348 --> 00:13:23,806
Hi, handsome.
How are you feeling?

146
00:13:23,985 --> 00:13:27,751
Hmm. Poor little thing.

147
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:29,821
Just try to relax.

148
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:32,226
This will all be over soon.

149
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:48,440
Why would anyone
jump out of a perfectly good airplane?

150
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:50,771
Because it's so fucking fun!

151
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:01,980
You make sure our package arrives
in one piece.

152
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:04,023
And send someone to take care of Frog.

153
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,375
DJ X...

154
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,679
...the man behind the machine. I've been
whoring the fuck out of your next party...

155
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:01,215
...on my website,
and you can't even text me back?

156
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,915
You know how many media impressions
that is a day?

157
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:06,647
Don't put your hands on me, man.
I don't even know you.

158
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,260
That's our head of security, Kirk O'Dale.

159
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:12,085
There...

160
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:13,553
...now you know him.

161
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,868
Well, just wait a minute.
If you don't give an interview right now...

162
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:22,733
...then I swear I'll make it
my personal mission in life...

163
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:27,900
...to make sure that no one goes
to any more of your stupid parties ever.

164
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,740
Well, we wouldn't want that.

165
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:33,211
After all...

166
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:36,716
...ever is a long time.

167
00:15:36,888 --> 00:15:38,515
Step into my office.

168
00:16:11,522 --> 00:16:13,957
I've got the blues

169
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:17,552
I've got the blues

170
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:22,432
I ain't got nothing but the blues

171
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:25,627
I ain't got nothing but the blues

172
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:27,601
Why did you go?

173
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:29,764
Ugh. Creepy.

174
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:31,409
Why did you go

175
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:36,648
And leave me here with the blues?

176
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:40,115
And leave me here with the blues?

177
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:43,686
You left me sad and you left me sore

178
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:46,484
You left me with the lowdown blues

179
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,992
Hello, Edgar.

180
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:52,027
What brings you all the way down here?

181
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:54,792
Now I have to have an excuse
to visit my own brother?

182
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:57,163
At 1 in the morning, yeah.

183
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:59,327
I figured you'd be up.

184
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:02,565
I've recently learned
there's a nightcrawler...

185
00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:06,405
...who's created a new designer drug
that he's handing out to kids at raves.

186
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:09,241
The only problem is it's not a drug...

187
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:10,541
...it's vampire blood.

188
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:13,878
He's breeding an undead army...

189
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:18,319
...and the only thing that stands
between him...

190
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:20,920
...and the annihilation...

191
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:23,655
...of the entire human race...

192
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,661
...potentially...

193
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:26,956
...would be us.

194
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:30,294
The Frog Brothers.

195
00:17:31,704 --> 00:17:35,640
We haven't been the Frog Brothers
for a long time.

196
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,800
I just...

197
00:17:38,378 --> 00:17:41,075
- I can't do it without you.
- What about Sam?

198
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:42,737
Sam's gone.

199
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:46,182
He turned,
and, uh, I had to do what I had to do.

200
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:49,915
I guess that cancels out
Michael and Star.

201
00:17:51,158 --> 00:17:56,221
Yeah. I'm pretty much persona non grata
with the entire Emerson family at this point.

202
00:17:56,397 --> 00:17:58,524
- Laddie?
- He's moved on.

203
00:17:58,698 --> 00:18:02,100
He's got a wife, kids.

204
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:04,363
He's got a real life now.

205
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:06,733
- Yeah, well, so do I.
- You call this a life?

206
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:10,343
- This from a guy who lives in a trailer.
- Okay, so I've got nothing.

207
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:12,878
But at least I know what side I'm on!

208
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:17,944
Alan, if this is the head vampire,
then maybe we can kill him.

209
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:20,882
If we kill him,
then we just gotta find the one above him...

210
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:26,459
...and then on and on like that forever.
- They are telling me that this is the alpha.

211
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:30,723
The O.G. Of all bloodsuckers,
the head vampire.

212
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:33,560
It's a pyramid scheme, Edgar.

213
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:34,861
Always has been.

214
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:39,006
What if this is it though?

215
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:41,301
What if this really is the head vampire?

216
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:42,966
Get this...

217
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,442
...and get it good, Edgar.

218
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:47,971
As far as I'm concerned...

219
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:53,053
...there's no such thing as vampires.

220
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:58,219
Hola, Trashynistas.
I'm sitting here with the one, the only...

221
00:18:58,393 --> 00:19:00,224
...DJ X.

222
00:19:00,395 --> 00:19:03,057
I'm sorry for those of you
who have a shitty connection.

223
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:06,690
I guess you'll just have to take my word
for when I tell you...

224
00:19:06,868 --> 00:19:10,805
...the man's absolutely scrumptious.

225
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:13,441
They'll just have to
come and see me in person.

226
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:16,237
Yeah, well,
they'll just have to get in line. Ha, ha.

227
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:20,413
So, DJ X,
why do you think the detached and the...

228
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:24,279
...you know, the disconnected youth
of today have latched on so fervently...

229
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:25,749
...to your parties?

230
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,319
Because I create a place...

231
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,256
...where all the lost souls of the world
can come together.

232
00:19:31,694 --> 00:19:34,128
A place where they can do
what they want...

233
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:36,924
...whenever they wanna do it.

234
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,765
Yeah,
you heard it straight from the man himself...

235
00:19:39,935 --> 00:19:43,894
...all you lost boys and girls. This is
gonna be the biggest rave of the century.

236
00:19:44,073 --> 00:19:47,339
And we'll let you know where
it's gonna be an hour before this event...

237
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,572
...so stay tuned to this website
for the deets.

238
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:54,211
That was a great interview, X.

239
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:55,681
Thank you so much.

240
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:58,219
No, no, thank you...

241
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:00,083
...for getting the word out.

242
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:05,193
I wanna have as many people at this event
as possible.

243
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:06,852
It's my pleasure.

244
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:09,657
And I mean that.

245
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:14,996
So anyhow, what do you guys
have to drink in this jalopy?

246
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:17,997
You.

247
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,042
Death to all vampires.

248
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,847
Maximum body count.

249
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,581
We're awesome monster bashers.

250
00:20:33,758 --> 00:20:36,693
- The meanest.
- The baddest.

251
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,174
Edgar.

252
00:21:00,351 --> 00:21:02,944
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need weapons.

253
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:05,217
Lots of weapons.

254
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:10,355
Lots of really expensive,
custom-made weapons.

255
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:12,018
Well, of course. Come in.

256
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,058
Hmm.

257
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:19,266
Please have a seat.

258
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,936
So aren't you the least bit curious
on how I know so much about vampires?

259
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,135
Not really.

260
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:28,540
I know who you are.

261
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:33,242
You're Gwen Lieber. Bestselling author
of the Eternity Kiss series.

262
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,910
First of which is about to be made
into a major motion picture...

263
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,113
...coming soon to a theater near you.

264
00:21:40,658 --> 00:21:43,059
Oh, you've heard of me. I'm flattered.

265
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:45,788
Don't be. Your books suck.

266
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:49,057
I'm sorry you feel that way.

267
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:50,963
Doesn't really matter what I think.

268
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:54,105
You've got millions of emo-goth sheep
all over the world...

269
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:58,004
...who eat up every last word of it,
and keep coming back for more.

270
00:21:58,177 --> 00:22:02,637
I'm sure you've made quite a nice living
off your supernatural bodice-rippers.

271
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:07,410
I'll have you know, I have gotten glowing
reviews from every major periodical.

272
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:10,282
Bought and paid for, I'm sure.

273
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,513
Just like me.

274
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,454
What is your problem, Frog?

275
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:14,752
My problem?

276
00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:17,920
My problem is you glorify vampirism.

277
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:21,800
You make being a vampire look...

278
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:23,329
...sexy.

279
00:22:24,837 --> 00:22:26,202
Well...

280
00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:30,833
...there has always been an element
of eroticism in vampire mythology.

281
00:22:31,277 --> 00:22:35,304
There is nothing sexy
about being a member of the undead.

282
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:39,813
Well, perhaps I have made a serious mistake
in coming to you.

283
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:44,150
If you came to me expecting me to ask
for your autograph, then yes, you did.

284
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:48,988
But if you came to me
expecting me to kill a shitload of vampires...

285
00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:50,958
...that I can do.

286
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:07,373
Don't like the stake...

287
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:10,176
...maybe it needs a little garlic?

288
00:23:13,354 --> 00:23:15,219
Here we go.

289
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:19,185
Freshly served.

290
00:23:20,627 --> 00:23:21,652
Shit.

291
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:36,835
Eat that.

292
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:46,018
- Frog.
GWEN Edgar, it's Gwen.

293
00:23:46,187 --> 00:23:48,245
Can you come by my hotel right away?

294
00:23:48,422 --> 00:23:49,787
It's rather important.

295
00:23:49,957 --> 00:23:52,949
All right. I'll be right there.

296
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:10,606
Hello, Edgar.

297
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:13,839
So, what's so important you need me
to come down here right away?

298
00:24:14,015 --> 00:24:16,677
Well, I thought you should meet
your new partner.

299
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:21,220
When you turned me down,
I was desperate, so I hired someone else...

300
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:25,520
...and I'd really feel bad making him come
all the way from Hollywood for nothing.

301
00:24:25,695 --> 00:24:26,718
Hollywood?

302
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:30,626
I don't like the sound of it. Who is this?

303
00:24:36,071 --> 00:24:37,902
Lars Von Goetz?

304
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:47,175
Lars, this is...

305
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,817
Oh, yeah. The Toad.

306
00:24:50,152 --> 00:24:51,710
Frog.

307
00:24:51,887 --> 00:24:53,980
- Edgar Frog.
- That's what I said.

308
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,018
Yeah.

309
00:24:56,192 --> 00:24:57,454
I'm Lars Von Goetz.

310
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,116
But you already knew that.

311
00:24:59,695 --> 00:25:02,664
And this is Claus, my camera operator.

312
00:25:02,832 --> 00:25:06,165
So let's go kick the shit
out of some little rave punks, huh?

313
00:25:06,336 --> 00:25:08,064
But first, I gotta eat.

314
00:25:08,237 --> 00:25:10,763
I got the metabolism
of a 12-year-old boy.

315
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,703
Can I speak with you for a minute?

316
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:14,967
Right.

317
00:25:16,346 --> 00:25:18,870
Never fear, Lars Von Goetz is here.

318
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:21,882
As long as the check clears.

319
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,684
Lars Von Goetz?

320
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:26,448
You hired Lars Von Goetz?

321
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:29,192
- I thought you'd be happy.
- Happy?

322
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:31,821
First you expect me
to kill a head vampire...

323
00:25:31,995 --> 00:25:34,930
...then you expect me
to babysit some reality show reject?

324
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:37,190
You're not going to have to babysit him.

325
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:39,130
Haven't you seen his show?

326
00:25:39,302 --> 00:25:43,602
The man's wrestled a grizzly bear,
a lion and an alligator.

327
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:45,002
He's amazing.

328
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:46,506
That was staged.

329
00:25:46,676 --> 00:25:50,134
All reality shows are staged, okay?

330
00:25:50,313 --> 00:25:53,339
Von Goetz, whatever his name is,
he's a fraud.

331
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:57,652
Vampires are, like,
10 times stronger than grizzly bears.

332
00:25:58,088 --> 00:26:02,422
- Well, I think he can take care of himself.
- We'll see about that.

333
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:04,185
That creepy guy's looking at me.

334
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,056
Oh, gross.
Here's the deal.

335
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:08,221
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need weapons.

336
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:10,028
Right. You said that.

337
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,929
I'll go see my guy tomorrow.

338
00:26:12,102 --> 00:26:14,435
- You don't want me to come with you?
- No.

339
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,701
He's a little twitchy about new faces.

340
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,718
Listen, buddy, if you're looking
for the diet frozen-yogurt bar...

341
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:38,885
...it went out of business last summer.

342
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:41,759
Actually,
I'm looking for a Batman number 14.

343
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,458
That's a very serious book, man.

344
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:44,897
Only five in existence.

345
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,866
Four, actually.

346
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,802
I'm always looking out
for the other three.

347
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,380
Edgar, since I know...

348
00:27:32,552 --> 00:27:35,749
...I'll never be able to talk you
out of what you're about to do...

349
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:40,648
...I can't let you go up against a potential
head vampire without giving you this.

350
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:44,285
One of the first books on vampire hunting
ever written.

351
00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:48,525
It'll hopefully keep you safe.
Watch your back. Alan.

352
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:53,535
P.S. If you're still alive on Tuesday,
be sure to call Mom.

353
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,606
It's her birthday.

354
00:27:57,277 --> 00:27:59,141
ZOE Book O'Neer.
- Hey, Zoe.

355
00:27:59,312 --> 00:28:01,109
I need your help with something.

356
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:03,209
- It's important.
Sure.

357
00:28:03,383 --> 00:28:05,317
I'll be waiting.

358
00:28:12,225 --> 00:28:16,458
Wow, so the Gwen Lieber
hired you to find her kidnapped brother?

359
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:19,030
Yeah, and I think this book
might help me figure out...

360
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,393
...where they've taken him to.

361
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:23,401
I need you to scour it for any clues,
anything you can find.

362
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:28,473
I don't see how this old book is gonna
help you find anyone, but I'll give it a try.

363
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:30,634
Do me a favor.

364
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:32,937
If you happen to run across
anything in here...

365
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:37,379
...that talks about human sacrifice
or anything like that, make note of it.

366
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:38,677
All right.

367
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:40,012
Cool.

368
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:43,755
Uh, do you wanna tell me why?

369
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:46,086
Not really.

370
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,820
Could put your life in danger.

371
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:52,596
Okay.

372
00:29:21,196 --> 00:29:22,424
Oh, my gosh.

373
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

374
00:29:53,762 --> 00:29:55,559
Where's Frog?

375
00:29:58,433 --> 00:29:59,764
Back off, fucko!

376
00:30:00,202 --> 00:30:02,635
Or what? You gonna mace me?

377
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:10,111
Somebody needed a light?

378
00:30:11,747 --> 00:30:13,009
Frog.

379
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:15,379
Ugly.

380
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:23,819
You're dead.

381
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,560
Suck on this.

382
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:38,931
Watch out!

383
00:30:44,214 --> 00:30:46,113
Nice.

384
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:50,818
Mace?

385
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:52,921
Holy water.

386
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,517
I feel like pancakes.

387
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:57,250
Order up.

388
00:30:58,395 --> 00:31:01,364
I found a whole section
of young male vampire sacrifices.

389
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:03,522
And look, there's a Blood Moon.

390
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,568
They call it that because the moon's face
is deep red or crimson hue.

391
00:31:07,738 --> 00:31:12,107
So they're gonna make a sacrifice
under the Blood Moon.

392
00:31:12,275 --> 00:31:13,300
Exactly.

393
00:31:13,477 --> 00:31:16,913
This Friday is a Blood Moon.

394
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,640
So they're gonna
sacrifice Peter at the rave.

395
00:31:19,816 --> 00:31:23,775
- Well, Edgar, you can't let that happen.
- All right, if I'm gonna do this...

396
00:31:23,954 --> 00:31:27,151
...I need to find out where the rave is
and I need to find out fast.

397
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:29,519
Well, technically, raves are illegal...

398
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:32,958
...so the promoters aren't gonna say
where it is until the last minute.

399
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:36,328
You said that the rumor is that
it was gonna be here in San Cazador.

400
00:31:36,501 --> 00:31:39,765
Even if it is here,
San Cazador is a big place.

401
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,540
If we're gonna find out where that nest is...

402
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:47,269
...we need to learn
how to think like a vampire.

403
00:31:47,445 --> 00:31:49,776
Bloodsuckers have a tendency
to look for a place...

404
00:31:49,947 --> 00:31:53,439
...that's got a history
of suffering and death.

405
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:55,912
You know of a place like that here?

406
00:31:56,087 --> 00:31:58,920
There's an old slaughterhouse
on San Cazador Island.

407
00:31:59,457 --> 00:32:00,685
Slaughterhouse?

408
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:03,754
Perfect.

409
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:07,523
Nothing vampires love more
than blood and carnage.

410
00:32:07,698 --> 00:32:12,693
If there's a slaughterhouse on that island,
that's where they'll be.

411
00:32:23,682 --> 00:32:25,673
Let me go.

412
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,781
- I promise, l...
- Uh-uh-uh.

413
00:32:29,221 --> 00:32:32,452
Let's not make any promises
we can't keep.

414
00:32:32,925 --> 00:32:36,884
You just lie here
like a good piece of veal...

415
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:42,125
...and maybe I'll bring you
a nice glass of warm milk.

416
00:33:17,303 --> 00:33:18,326
Hmm.

417
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,690
So where are we going?

418
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,588
My friend likes his privacy.

419
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:42,853
The name's Blake.

420
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:47,160
Used to be a congressman
before he learned the truth.

421
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:50,659
What's up with all the razor wire?

422
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Yo, Blake. Open up.
It's Edgar.

423
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:28,240
Whew. Edgar.

424
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:30,571
- How's it hanging?
- What's up, Blake?

425
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:32,376
Holy-water grenade.

426
00:34:32,546 --> 00:34:33,740
- Nice touch.
- Yeah.

427
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:36,383
- Needs a little work, though.
- Yeah.

428
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,882
Who the hell's this?

429
00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:40,044
Oh, this is Zoe.

430
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:41,446
She's cool.

431
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:43,215
Yeah, I'll be the judge of that.

432
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:47,920
Touch the cross. Do it now.

433
00:34:51,031 --> 00:34:53,830
Zoe, manners.

434
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:57,201
- Nice to meet you.
- Blake.

435
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,038
What's with the bike?

436
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:02,541
Oh, that's a beauty.
I've been working on her for a full year.

437
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:05,374
Renovations, the lot.
She's gonna be a real killer.

438
00:35:05,547 --> 00:35:08,539
Yeah. Unfortunately, wouldn't do us
much good on this mission.

439
00:35:09,284 --> 00:35:10,308
What else you got?

440
00:35:12,388 --> 00:35:14,947
Welcome to the lair.

441
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:17,651
What happened to this thing?

442
00:35:18,294 --> 00:35:20,261
Looks like something
blew up in the barrel.

443
00:35:20,428 --> 00:35:22,863
You should see the vampire
I was pointing it at.

444
00:35:23,031 --> 00:35:25,728
Let's just say the gun came out
on the winning side.

445
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:28,196
Nice new stuff, Blake.

446
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:29,395
I like it.

447
00:35:32,842 --> 00:35:35,572
You looking for something
to replace your Old Reliable?

448
00:35:35,745 --> 00:35:36,973
Never.

449
00:35:37,146 --> 00:35:38,841
Ah, you say that now.

450
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:41,577
Feast your eyes on this.

451
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,243
An old Russki RG-6 grenade launcher.

452
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:47,116
Whoa.

453
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:48,514
Heavy.

454
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:52,317
Fires 40 mm fragmentation grenades.

455
00:35:52,495 --> 00:35:53,792
Not this one.

456
00:35:53,963 --> 00:35:55,955
This one fires these.

457
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:58,159
What is it? Holy water?

458
00:35:58,334 --> 00:35:59,801
Mixed with a little garlic.

459
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:01,095
Just for giggles.

460
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:05,435
- I'll take it.
- I thought you might.

461
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:09,172
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

462
00:36:12,883 --> 00:36:13,940
What's this?

463
00:36:14,116 --> 00:36:15,982
Hey, put that down, please.

464
00:36:16,153 --> 00:36:17,984
Very carefully, okay?

465
00:36:18,154 --> 00:36:20,715
That is a prototype resin grenade.

466
00:36:20,891 --> 00:36:24,327
I stole it from a military testing facility
at Groom Lake.

467
00:36:25,695 --> 00:36:27,822
What does it do?
- Oh, shit.

468
00:36:35,672 --> 00:36:37,401
Cool.

469
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:39,639
Yeah, cool.

470
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,937
I will take that other resin grenade,
though.

471
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,511
Gotta hand it to the grays...

472
00:36:43,948 --> 00:36:46,883
...they sure are good at making weapons.

473
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,281
Well, it's a pleasure doing business
with you, Edgar, as always.

474
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,552
Mm.

475
00:36:56,727 --> 00:36:59,423
Say, you guys wanna stay for dinner?
I got beans.

476
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:01,923
Yeah, you do.

477
00:37:13,611 --> 00:37:14,908
What the hell are these?

478
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,546
Those?

479
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:18,739
- Those are, uh...
- A reminder.

480
00:37:37,202 --> 00:37:38,429
Vampires.

481
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:40,935
They must have tracked us here.

482
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:47,275
What did you do to them?
- High-powered UV lamps.

483
00:37:47,446 --> 00:37:49,811
Edgar, all the weapons are in the car.

484
00:37:50,649 --> 00:37:52,742
I guess we're gonna have to improvise.

485
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,264
They've taken out the UV lights.

486
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:20,844
Hi, sweetheart,
aren't you gonna invite me in?

487
00:38:21,014 --> 00:38:23,608
No. You're not invited.

488
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:44,696
Wait. Where are you going?

489
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,474
Holy shit, we gotta get out of here.

490
00:38:49,642 --> 00:38:51,166
They'll kill us if we go outside.

491
00:38:51,344 --> 00:38:53,869
I'd rather be bit than burned.
Come on, let's go!

492
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,011
- Hi there.
- Guys, get down!

493
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:14,864
Say hello to Old Painless.

494
00:39:15,368 --> 00:39:17,859
Now, that's what I call a stakeout.

495
00:39:18,304 --> 00:39:19,566
It's cool, right?

496
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:21,571
Yeah, it should be. It's my design.

497
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:11,221
If all of these freaks go to the island
and take the Thirst at the rave...

498
00:40:11,393 --> 00:40:15,523
...we're gonna have a full-on
vampire invasion on our hands.

499
00:40:16,965 --> 00:40:18,762
Okay, man, you got the glow sticks?

500
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:20,696
Let's roll.

501
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,398
Oh, yeah.

502
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:26,469
Oh, yes.

503
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,005
Hey. You didn't tell me...

504
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,202
...Lars Von Goetz was gonna be here.
Yeah.

505
00:40:30,378 --> 00:40:32,471
- I was kind of hoping he wasn't.
Oh, yeah.

506
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:34,548
That guy is a total animal.
Yes, baby.

507
00:40:34,717 --> 00:40:37,185
You see the episode
where he wrestled the grizzly bear?

508
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:38,581
- Missed it.
Oh, yeah.

509
00:40:41,424 --> 00:40:42,754
Toad.

510
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:46,353
Hmm.

511
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:49,488
So, hmm, who's your friend?

512
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:52,633
Hi. I'm Zoe.

513
00:40:52,802 --> 00:40:53,825
Zoe.

514
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,828
Tell me, Zoe, is it just me...

515
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:59,667
...or is there some serious chemistry
between us?

516
00:40:59,842 --> 00:41:01,309
That's just you.

517
00:41:01,477 --> 00:41:03,172
Okay.

518
00:41:05,314 --> 00:41:06,576
Edgar.

519
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:09,708
I hope you brought your bathing suit.

520
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:12,411
I thought we should blend in
with the other partygoers.

521
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:14,613
Covert infiltration.

522
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,950
It's a good idea.

523
00:41:18,627 --> 00:41:20,026
Hi, I'm Gwen.

524
00:41:20,196 --> 00:41:24,360
Yeah, I know.
I've sold, like, a bazillion of your books.

525
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:27,229
- I'm Zoe.
- Right.

526
00:41:28,004 --> 00:41:29,596
You work in a bookstore?

527
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:31,166
Part-time.

528
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,175
And Edgar thinks that you're qualified
for this mission?

529
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:38,604
Just how many bloodsuckers
have you killed, Miss Lieber?

530
00:41:39,316 --> 00:41:42,114
- None.
- More qualified than you.

531
00:41:42,285 --> 00:41:46,517
Well, this is Edgar's show,
and I trust him.

532
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:51,616
Did I mention I hated her books?

533
00:41:51,795 --> 00:41:53,023
So do I.

534
00:42:00,637 --> 00:42:02,537
Rave!

535
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:08,635
All right, everybody.
According to the blueprints...

536
00:42:08,813 --> 00:42:12,840
...there's an entrance to the slaughterhouse
through a series of underground tunnels...

537
00:42:13,017 --> 00:42:16,508
...which will lead us directly
to where the rave is.

538
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:20,684
Now, remember, everyone,
there will be a lot of civilians around.

539
00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:23,590
Toadies, not familiars.

540
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,788
Just innocent partygoers who are all there
because they think they're gonna have...

541
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:29,659
...fun.

542
00:42:31,202 --> 00:42:33,102
Because of this, you will be armed...

543
00:42:33,271 --> 00:42:36,331
...with weapons that are non-lethal
to anything with a heartbeat.

544
00:42:36,774 --> 00:42:41,837
This is a sawed-off, pump action,
Soak and Destroy water gun.

545
00:42:43,214 --> 00:42:44,340
Patent pending.

546
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,443
Turns holy water...

547
00:42:46,618 --> 00:42:49,085
...into holy slaughter.

548
00:42:49,253 --> 00:42:50,846
Zoe, you take it.

549
00:42:51,023 --> 00:42:52,046
Claus...

550
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:55,359
...it's a high-powered UV torch.

551
00:42:55,526 --> 00:42:58,427
Tie it around your waist.
You'll thank me later.

552
00:42:58,596 --> 00:43:00,564
Edgar, what about me?

553
00:43:01,466 --> 00:43:02,593
You're staying here.

554
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:04,295
The hell I am!

555
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:06,529
This is my brother we are talking about.

556
00:43:06,705 --> 00:43:08,638
I understand that...

557
00:43:08,806 --> 00:43:11,275
...but this is not one of your books,
Gwen.

558
00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:14,473
Everybody on this mission
is a trained veteran.

559
00:43:15,013 --> 00:43:17,914
You could be killed, or worse...

560
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:21,574
...you could be turned into one of them.
Okay, time out.

561
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:25,450
Listen, Gwen, I totally buy into
your little vampire goth games...

562
00:43:25,624 --> 00:43:28,559
...that's what you're paying me to do,
but I'm calling bullshit.

563
00:43:28,728 --> 00:43:30,251
If Gwen wants to go, she can go.

564
00:43:30,696 --> 00:43:34,655
Not as long as I'm in charge
of this mission.

565
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:36,562
It's all right, Lars.

566
00:43:36,735 --> 00:43:39,169
Listen to him.
Edgar knows what he's talking about.

567
00:43:39,338 --> 00:43:41,169
He's an experienced vampire hunter.

568
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,435
Wrong. I'm sorry to be the one
to break this to you...

569
00:43:44,611 --> 00:43:47,171
...but there are no
experienced vampire hunters...

570
00:43:47,347 --> 00:43:50,248
...because there are no vampires.
They do not exist.

571
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:52,076
Hmm.

572
00:43:52,518 --> 00:43:55,511
Zoe, take these stakes,
strap them to your leg.

573
00:43:55,688 --> 00:43:57,349
And why does she get stakes?

574
00:43:57,524 --> 00:44:00,049
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were Mr. Tough Guy...

575
00:44:00,226 --> 00:44:04,162
...who wrestled a 6-foot alligator with your
bare hands. You don't need weapons.

576
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,389
No, it was 10-foot.

577
00:44:06,565 --> 00:44:08,625
- And I still want stakes.
- Fine.

578
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,667
There's some stakes.

579
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:14,601
Why are hers metal?

580
00:44:15,441 --> 00:44:17,272
You get what you get.

581
00:44:18,012 --> 00:44:19,740
Let's go.

582
00:44:21,214 --> 00:44:22,442
Edgar, wait.

583
00:44:24,884 --> 00:44:26,283
Bring him back safe.

584
00:44:26,453 --> 00:44:28,182
I'll do my best.

585
00:44:28,621 --> 00:44:29,781
Move out.

586
00:44:32,493 --> 00:44:33,517
Hey, Toad.

587
00:44:33,694 --> 00:44:37,094
Couldn't we come back at night?
It would look so much better on camera.

588
00:44:37,263 --> 00:44:39,494
No. Vampires feed at night...

589
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:43,124
...and I don't plan on
sticking around for dinner.

590
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Is this the VIP room?

591
00:45:24,112 --> 00:45:26,807
Oh, most definitely.

592
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:30,974
- When's the party supposed to start?
- Not for a while.

593
00:45:31,152 --> 00:45:33,950
You guys got here early.

594
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, are those promise rings?
- So cute.
Is that blood on your face?

595
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:25,269
Oh! I think I just broke my coccyx.

596
00:46:25,441 --> 00:46:27,773
Forget the coccyx, is the camera okay?

597
00:46:44,194 --> 00:46:46,491
Radio check.
Check.

598
00:46:46,662 --> 00:46:48,994
Check.
Check.

599
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:56,269
All right. Once inside,
our main objective is to extract Peter.

600
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:59,000
Killing vampires is our second priority.

601
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,274
All right, everybody...

602
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:02,673
...let's rock 'n' roll.

603
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,050
Heads up.

604
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:19,558
Hey, did you name your new gun yet?

605
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,220
Shh.

606
00:47:22,432 --> 00:47:23,729
What?

607
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,960
Did you name your new gun yet?

608
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:30,997
What are you talking about?

609
00:47:31,174 --> 00:47:33,142
All guns need a name.

610
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,800
Like boats.

611
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:36,776
Boats are for sailors...

612
00:47:36,947 --> 00:47:39,542
...guns are for soldiers.

613
00:47:39,716 --> 00:47:41,707
I'm no sailor.

614
00:47:46,657 --> 00:47:48,318
- Lars.
What?

615
00:47:48,492 --> 00:47:50,791
I'm getting a really bad feeling about this.

616
00:47:50,962 --> 00:47:55,830
Ugh. What, you mean being deep within
the earth beneath a thousand tons of rock?

617
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:01,463
Are you feeling "Claus-trophobic"?

618
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,334
Get it? "Claus-trophobic"?

619
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:06,909
That's not funny.
I'm serious, man, look around you.

620
00:48:07,078 --> 00:48:09,342
This shit's freaking me out.

621
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jeepers.

622
00:48:49,454 --> 00:48:50,978
All right, here's the deal.

623
00:48:51,156 --> 00:48:53,681
We're gonna go to the left,
you guys go to the right.

624
00:48:53,859 --> 00:48:55,520
Zoe, you're with me.

625
00:48:55,694 --> 00:48:59,460
Lars and Claus, do whatever it is you do.

626
00:48:59,631 --> 00:49:01,963
We'll reconvene back on the beach...

627
00:49:02,135 --> 00:49:03,829
...maybe.

628
00:49:11,677 --> 00:49:13,771
You know,
I kind of hate the fact we split up.

629
00:49:13,947 --> 00:49:17,245
People in horror movies always split up
and they always get killed.

630
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:19,976
There's nothing to worry about, Claus.
Don't you get it?

631
00:49:20,152 --> 00:49:22,121
This is all some stupid role-playing game.

632
00:49:22,288 --> 00:49:26,384
All we're gonna find is some little emo goth
kids with fake fangs and contact lenses.

633
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,151
You think this is a game?

634
00:49:28,328 --> 00:49:32,662
Of course I think it's a game. Why else
would the Toad give me a water pistol?

635
00:49:34,033 --> 00:49:38,766
Besides, my fans are tired of seeing me
tackle every natural predator on the planet.

636
00:49:38,938 --> 00:49:41,236
Now, we need to give them
something new to watch.

637
00:49:41,408 --> 00:49:42,499
But if you're right...

638
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:46,441
...you're gonna be beating up a bunch
of kids with fake fangs and contact lenses.

639
00:49:46,613 --> 00:49:48,046
I know.

640
00:49:48,214 --> 00:49:49,408
Isn't it great?

641
00:50:05,966 --> 00:50:08,730
This is the entrance
to the slaughterhouse.

642
00:50:08,903 --> 00:50:12,395
Time for Mr. Frog's wild ride.

643
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:15,732
Ow.

644
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:21,812
Claus, we gotta find a place
to do my intro.

645
00:50:22,983 --> 00:50:24,314
Oh, yeah.

646
00:50:24,485 --> 00:50:25,713
This is perfect.

647
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,049
Okay.

648
00:50:30,357 --> 00:50:34,088
Using my tracking ability,
we've located the nest of the vampires...

649
00:50:34,261 --> 00:50:37,094
...deep within
this abandoned slaughterhouse.

650
00:50:37,531 --> 00:50:39,090
It's also haunted...

651
00:50:39,267 --> 00:50:41,757
...by cannibal pirates.

652
00:50:42,337 --> 00:50:45,863
It's built on an
ancient Indian burial ground...

653
00:50:48,609 --> 00:50:51,305
...where they used to burn witches.

654
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,351
Oh.

655
00:51:39,762 --> 00:51:41,286
A promise ring.

656
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:42,897
Virgins.

657
00:51:43,065 --> 00:51:46,465
Vampire filet mignon.

658
00:51:55,478 --> 00:51:59,642
Ugh. What kind of fucked up shit is this?

659
00:51:59,815 --> 00:52:01,646
Are you Peter?

660
00:52:02,351 --> 00:52:04,444
Please, help me.

661
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:08,984
Dude. Turn around, let's go.

662
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,092
- What?
- It's too early to find him.

663
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,388
We gotta find him
at the end of the episode.

664
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:16,691
I haven't even had the chance
to put the beat-down on any goths yet.

665
00:52:16,866 --> 00:52:19,097
- But he's right here.
- Dude, turn around.

666
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:20,896
Sorry, Peter. Let's go.

667
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,368
What the fuck?

668
00:52:22,538 --> 00:52:25,269
Where are you bastards going?

669
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,439
Something smells really bad in here.

670
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,480
It's a slaughterhouse.

671
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:38,246
I don't mean the typical
bad slaughterhouse dead meat smell...

672
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:41,516
...I mean I smell something...
It smells like rotting garbage.

673
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:42,851
Trash.

674
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:45,358
Yeah, like I said. Rotting garbage.

675
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:46,587
No.

676
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:51,097
I mean Jonny Trash.

677
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jeez Louise.
Jeez Louise? Really?

678
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,001
Zoe, get down!

679
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,221
You hear that?
What?

680
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,689
I think it's coming from down there.

681
00:53:18,663 --> 00:53:19,755
What are you doing?

682
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:21,558
Lars.

683
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,333
Lars.

684
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:54,054
Dude, where's my gear?

685
00:53:54,633 --> 00:53:56,260
You left it up...

686
00:53:57,769 --> 00:53:59,066
Oh, shit.

687
00:53:59,238 --> 00:54:00,535
What?

688
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,734
Oh, okay.

689
00:54:39,712 --> 00:54:41,145
Is this it?

690
00:54:41,314 --> 00:54:45,580
I've been waiting 300 years
for a good fight.

691
00:55:09,176 --> 00:55:11,405
Have you had enough, punk?

692
00:55:40,441 --> 00:55:43,035
Nice outfit.

693
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,643
That's funny...

694
00:55:46,113 --> 00:55:48,308
...that's exactly what I was thinking.

695
00:55:48,482 --> 00:55:49,915
But I still have to kill you.

696
00:55:53,587 --> 00:55:55,077
I'm surprised.

697
00:55:56,156 --> 00:55:57,589
By what?

698
00:55:59,393 --> 00:56:02,226
You're really not that good.

699
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,762
- Aah!
Edgar!

700
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:27,582
Zoe. I got this.

701
00:56:39,201 --> 00:56:43,399
Ah, shit! Damn bullets!

702
00:56:43,972 --> 00:56:46,634
See, now that's what happens
when you don't name your gun.

703
00:56:46,808 --> 00:56:48,639
Just pull out the sword!

704
00:56:49,111 --> 00:56:51,305
- On three.
- Okay.

705
00:56:51,747 --> 00:56:52,804
Three.

706
00:56:54,182 --> 00:56:56,742
What happened to one and two?

707
00:56:56,918 --> 00:57:00,116
Edgar? Edgar? Oh, God.

708
00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:01,950
Lars, what's your 20?

709
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,388
- It's not Lars, it's Claus.
- Claus, where's Lars?

710
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,585
He's dead.

711
00:57:06,762 --> 00:57:07,990
Lars is dead.

712
00:57:08,164 --> 00:57:10,632
We're so completely and totally fucked.

713
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,563
Claus, calm down. Just breathe.

714
00:57:13,035 --> 00:57:15,970
We have to get Edgar out of here
before reinforcements arrive.

715
00:57:25,147 --> 00:57:28,515
- Oh, my God. Zoe, what happened?
Just help us lay him down.

716
00:57:28,684 --> 00:57:30,447
Claus, first-aid kit.

717
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:37,086
Hang in there.
Everything's gonna be fine.

718
00:57:37,259 --> 00:57:38,625
Hold this.

719
00:57:38,794 --> 00:57:42,458
Edgar, stay with me.

720
00:57:49,138 --> 00:57:52,506
Notice anything unusual
about Santa Carla yet?

721
00:57:52,676 --> 00:57:55,577
No, it's a pretty cool place...

722
00:57:55,746 --> 00:57:56,804
...if you're a Martian.

723
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,208
Or a vampire.

724
00:57:59,249 --> 00:58:01,513
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint
or something?

725
00:58:01,685 --> 00:58:04,381
You think you know what's
happening around here, don't you?

726
00:58:04,554 --> 00:58:07,216
Well, I'll tell you something.
You don't know shit, buddy.

727
00:58:07,391 --> 00:58:11,293
Yeah. You think we just work
in a comic-book store for our folks, huh?

728
00:58:11,461 --> 00:58:13,487
Actually, I thought it was a bakery.

729
00:58:13,663 --> 00:58:14,858
This is just our cover.

730
00:58:16,067 --> 00:58:18,500
We're dedicated to a higher purpose.

731
00:58:18,668 --> 00:58:21,102
We're fighters for truth...

732
00:58:21,271 --> 00:58:22,636
...justice...

733
00:58:22,806 --> 00:58:24,707
...and the American way.

734
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,706
Edgar.

735
00:58:29,546 --> 00:58:32,141
- Edgar.
- What?

736
00:58:32,316 --> 00:58:34,375
- What happened to me?
- You're okay.

737
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,054
Did we get him? Did we get Peter?

738
00:58:38,221 --> 00:58:41,487
Claus found him,
but they ran into some trouble.

739
00:58:41,926 --> 00:58:45,362
They had him tied
to some twisted table kind of thing...

740
00:58:45,529 --> 00:58:48,158
...pumping him full of drugs,
trying to keep him sedated.

741
00:58:48,331 --> 00:58:50,926
Where's your boss? Von Geek?

742
00:58:51,102 --> 00:58:54,367
Some big-ass, massive juggernaut
of a vampire got him.

743
00:58:55,339 --> 00:58:57,330
Tore his heart right out of his chest.

744
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:00,170
Got it on tape, though.

745
00:59:01,646 --> 00:59:03,546
I'd like to see that
when you get a chance.

746
00:59:03,714 --> 00:59:06,205
- He'd like that.
- Thanks.

747
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:08,517
Gwen...

748
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,018
...it's gonna be okay.

749
00:59:11,556 --> 00:59:13,251
We'll get him.

750
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,450
It's not over yet.

751
00:59:20,631 --> 00:59:21,757
Payback's a bitch.

752
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,425
Damn straight. Let's go.

753
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,934
Rave! Rave!

754
00:59:34,813 --> 00:59:35,973
It's starting.

755
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,547
All right, come on.

756
00:59:43,356 --> 00:59:44,755
Hey!

757
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,747
Hey, there.

758
01:00:08,915 --> 01:00:09,973
Do you wanna party?

759
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:30,466
LILY And now,
the man you've been waiting for, DJ X!

760
01:00:47,387 --> 01:00:51,619
Are you ready for a sacrifice?

761
01:01:00,935 --> 01:01:03,836
Blood, blood, blood!

762
01:01:04,004 --> 01:01:06,632
Blood, blood, blood!

763
01:01:06,807 --> 01:01:09,367
Blood, blood, blood!

764
01:01:09,543 --> 01:01:10,567
Hold up.

765
01:01:11,278 --> 01:01:13,872
Oh, my God. There he is.

766
01:01:47,015 --> 01:01:49,778
If they get through that fence,
we're so undeniably fucked.

767
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:52,886
The sooner we take out X,
the sooner that won't be a problem.

768
01:01:53,054 --> 01:01:54,544
Okay, but what about Peter?

769
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:02,692
All right, listen up, everyone.
I want you all to hold back.

770
01:02:02,864 --> 01:02:04,456
I've only got one shot at this.

771
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:07,693
I'm gonna immobilize X
and then we go in for the kill.

772
01:02:07,869 --> 01:02:10,337
Everybody, stay put. Got it?

773
01:02:10,505 --> 01:02:12,029
- Got it.
- Good.

774
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:40,762
Put on something nasty, X.

775
01:02:40,936 --> 01:02:43,336
I think I found someone
I wanna dance with.

776
01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:48,375
He dropped it. I'm going in.

777
01:02:48,544 --> 01:02:50,136
Zoe, wait.

778
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:51,837
Get in here and help me. Come on.

779
01:03:06,896 --> 01:03:10,765
That is exactly
how I'm going to break your neck.

780
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:17,367
Vinyl still shreds.

781
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:35,685
Very creative, Frog.

782
01:03:39,429 --> 01:03:41,397
But when it comes to killing...

783
01:03:41,565 --> 01:03:47,629
...I prefer more traditional methods...

784
01:03:47,804 --> 01:03:50,568
...like impalement.

785
01:04:39,724 --> 01:04:42,625
Claus, cover us!

786
01:04:44,563 --> 01:04:46,428
Shit. Shit.

787
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,108
You fought admirably.

788
01:04:58,577 --> 01:05:02,411
But you were doomed to fail
from the start.

789
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:07,509
I've fought beside great warriors...

790
01:05:07,686 --> 01:05:09,176
...learned battle techniques...

791
01:05:09,354 --> 01:05:14,291
...that can only be mastered
over several lifetimes.

792
01:05:18,364 --> 01:05:23,323
And do you know
what the first rule of combat is?

793
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,898
Yeah, don't monologue.

794
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:38,974
There's a lot of vampires down here.

795
01:06:07,147 --> 01:06:09,341
Guys, I can't hold them off forever.

796
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,459
Fuck me. Fuck me!

797
01:06:26,834 --> 01:06:28,233
Edgar!

798
01:06:28,669 --> 01:06:30,500
Nice work. I've got it.

799
01:06:45,486 --> 01:06:48,183
You're right. Impalement is good.

800
01:06:49,056 --> 01:06:51,581
Especially when you pierce the heart.

801
01:07:07,241 --> 01:07:08,936
Peter.

802
01:07:11,346 --> 01:07:14,679
All right, everybody, listen up.
The party's officially over.

803
01:07:14,849 --> 01:07:18,285
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

804
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:22,757
Peter, can you hear me?

805
01:07:35,637 --> 01:07:37,572
- Eew.
- Buckets of eew.

806
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:40,231
Edgar, something's wrong.

807
01:07:40,409 --> 01:07:41,637
Yeah, I'd say.

808
01:07:41,811 --> 01:07:46,214
No, I mean we killed DJ X,
but I don't feel any different.

809
01:07:46,381 --> 01:07:48,976
Something's wrong.

810
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,654
They're still vampires. Nothing's changed.

811
01:07:55,825 --> 01:07:57,486
Edgar...

812
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:59,958
...this smells like garlic.

813
01:08:01,597 --> 01:08:03,394
Garlic?

814
01:08:03,566 --> 01:08:04,999
Let me see.

815
01:08:06,435 --> 01:08:09,632
You're right, it...
They were keeping him weak.

816
01:08:11,874 --> 01:08:13,900
You're the alpha.

817
01:08:14,076 --> 01:08:16,135
Oh, I bet you did not see that coming.

818
01:08:16,813 --> 01:08:18,178
Thanks to you.

819
01:08:18,347 --> 01:08:21,612
If X had been able to drink my blood
during the Blood Moon...

820
01:08:21,784 --> 01:08:24,275
...my power would have passed to him...

821
01:08:24,453 --> 01:08:26,979
...and that would have been a shame.

822
01:08:27,156 --> 01:08:30,888
I've been the alpha for a long, long time.

823
01:08:56,053 --> 01:08:59,682
You'll never grow old, you'll never die...

824
01:09:00,124 --> 01:09:01,886
...but you must feed.

825
01:09:07,864 --> 01:09:11,027
I brought you Edgar Frog,
just like you asked.

826
01:09:11,201 --> 01:09:12,668
Now it is your turn.

827
01:09:12,837 --> 01:09:15,704
Remember your promise to me.

828
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,708
I just don't wanna grow old. Sorry.

829
01:09:20,178 --> 01:09:22,009
Oh...

830
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,703
...you won't.

831
01:09:48,806 --> 01:09:50,775
They're all yours!

832
01:09:51,609 --> 01:09:53,201
Alan, wait!

833
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:58,745
No, no, no, this is not a good time
for the batteries to die.

834
01:09:58,916 --> 01:10:02,114
Claus, I need you to get Zoe to safety.

835
01:10:03,455 --> 01:10:05,786
Edgar, I'm not leaving without you.

836
01:10:05,957 --> 01:10:07,322
If we don't kill Peter right now...

837
01:10:07,492 --> 01:10:10,758
...there's gonna be a thousand
emo-goth vampires out there.

838
01:10:10,929 --> 01:10:13,227
I need you to warn the world.

839
01:10:13,398 --> 01:10:15,127
Especially in case I don't survive.

840
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,495
That's not an option.

841
01:10:20,005 --> 01:10:21,233
I'll be waiting.

842
01:10:22,574 --> 01:10:23,939
Just go.

843
01:10:26,879 --> 01:10:27,971
Come on.

844
01:10:29,982 --> 01:10:31,610
Claus.

845
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

846
01:10:55,608 --> 01:10:57,576
I'm disappointed in you, Edgar.

847
01:10:58,010 --> 01:11:00,445
This is no way to treat your savior.

848
01:11:00,613 --> 01:11:04,447
Savior? You got a funny way
of looking at things, kid.

849
01:11:04,617 --> 01:11:06,812
I saved you from a life of Ioneliness.

850
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:10,548
You didn't want to end up
like Robert Neville, did you? Ha, ha.

851
01:11:10,723 --> 01:11:14,250
Robert who?
- You really should read more books, Edgar.

852
01:11:15,828 --> 01:11:18,490
The ones without pictures
and word balloons.

853
01:11:18,998 --> 01:11:23,094
Robert Neville,
the protagonist in I Am Legend.

854
01:11:23,269 --> 01:11:27,433
Last man on Earth
in a world full of vampires.

855
01:11:28,275 --> 01:11:30,105
Is that really what you want to become?

856
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:34,036
I'm not thirsty.
You'll have to kill me first.

857
01:11:38,885 --> 01:11:40,615
I will, if necessary.

858
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:47,285
But that would be a shame...

859
01:11:47,461 --> 01:11:50,794
...especially since I owe you a debt
for killing X.

860
01:11:51,398 --> 01:11:54,731
Why didn't you just kill him yourself?

861
01:11:55,035 --> 01:11:58,061
A father can't murder his own children.

862
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,400
That would be in bad taste.

863
01:12:00,574 --> 01:12:03,543
Even an impertinent little shit like DJ X.

864
01:12:05,847 --> 01:12:10,147
I told him you can't turn all the cattle
into cowboys...

865
01:12:10,318 --> 01:12:13,185
...you'll wind up with too many cowboys.

866
01:12:13,354 --> 01:12:14,379
But he didn't listen.

867
01:12:14,556 --> 01:12:16,318
And now, thanks to his damned raves...

868
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:19,927
...there are going to be far too many
vampires roaming the Earth.

869
01:12:20,095 --> 01:12:21,255
That's where you come in.

870
01:12:21,429 --> 01:12:24,330
Keep the population down
to a manageable size.

871
01:12:25,332 --> 01:12:27,028
Plenty of blood to drink.

872
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:29,368
Everybody's happy.

873
01:12:29,536 --> 01:12:30,833
Precisely.

874
01:12:31,005 --> 01:12:36,342
Which is why I want you to keep on doing
what you're already so very good at.

875
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:39,275
Hunting and killing vampires.

876
01:12:39,446 --> 01:12:44,646
So you want me to be your own personal
hemo-sucking hit man, is that it?

877
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,343
Crudely worded...

878
01:12:46,788 --> 01:12:49,848
...but yes, that's the general idea.

879
01:12:53,061 --> 01:12:55,325
And what makes you think...

880
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:58,466
...that I won't just kill you myself?

881
01:12:58,633 --> 01:12:59,759
Nothing.

882
01:12:59,934 --> 01:13:02,369
Except that you have no real reason.

883
01:13:04,306 --> 01:13:06,103
Think about it, Edgar.

884
01:13:06,275 --> 01:13:08,799
Your brother's already one of us.

885
01:13:08,977 --> 01:13:14,244
Everyone you care about
is either dead or playing for my team.

886
01:13:15,117 --> 01:13:16,243
What do you say?

887
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:18,312
I say...

888
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,785
...why don't you go suck yourself?

889
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:27,391
Alan, kill your brother. You'll feel better.

890
01:13:28,097 --> 01:13:29,155
Alan, no.

891
01:13:29,832 --> 01:13:31,857
Don't do this.

892
01:13:32,802 --> 01:13:34,361
You're my brother.

893
01:13:34,537 --> 01:13:36,061
You're a Frog Brother.

894
01:13:41,611 --> 01:13:44,738
Don't make me hurt you.

895
01:13:48,452 --> 01:13:50,578
I told you not to make me hurt you.

896
01:14:06,837 --> 01:14:09,533
Last chance, Edgar.

897
01:14:19,116 --> 01:14:20,606
What the fuck?

898
01:14:33,063 --> 01:14:34,861
Fuck you!

899
01:14:58,589 --> 01:15:00,216
You okay?

900
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:02,387
Yeah.

901
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,891
Fang check.

902
01:15:08,099 --> 01:15:09,691
Hmm.

903
01:15:09,867 --> 01:15:11,392
Death to all vampires?

904
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:13,298
Maximum body count.

905
01:15:13,471 --> 01:15:16,406
We are awesome monster bashers.

906
01:15:16,574 --> 01:15:18,337
- The meanest.
- The baddest.

907
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:29,849
That's enough of that.

908
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,088
Hey. I thought you went to the beach
with your brother?

909
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:16,429
I did, actually, but, uh,
he wanted to stay out there longer.

910
01:16:16,603 --> 01:16:20,300
He stays out much longer, he's gonna
turn into a human piece of beef jerky.

911
01:16:21,674 --> 01:16:23,301
I guess he's making up for lost time.

912
01:16:23,476 --> 01:16:25,910
Yeah.
- Oh, guess what.

913
01:16:27,112 --> 01:16:30,412
I sold your copy of Destroy All Vampires
number 125...

914
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:32,511
...for 500 bucks.

915
01:16:32,685 --> 01:16:33,777
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

916
01:16:33,953 --> 01:16:35,079
That's great.

917
01:16:35,255 --> 01:16:37,985
That should keep the bank off my butt
for a while.

918
01:16:38,157 --> 01:16:41,525
Now, Zoe,
there's something I need to ask you.

919
01:16:42,061 --> 01:16:44,996
How did you know vampires are real?

920
01:16:45,164 --> 01:16:46,927
Just a hunch.

921
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,224
What are you reading?

922
01:16:49,402 --> 01:16:52,770
Oh, I'm actually scanning the book
into my Kindle.

923
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:54,100
I decided, you know...

924
01:16:54,275 --> 01:16:58,803
...I might as well educate myself about
all the possibilities of the dark underworld.

925
01:16:58,978 --> 01:17:02,038
For example,
did you know that lycanthrope...

926
01:17:02,215 --> 01:17:05,515
...or female werewolves, she-wolves...

927
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:09,147
...actually can change
anytime they want to?

928
01:17:09,322 --> 01:17:12,052
They don't have to do it under a full moon.
That's a myth.

929
01:17:12,225 --> 01:17:14,319
They can turn anytime they want to.

930
01:17:14,495 --> 01:17:17,623
They have complete control.
They can do it in the middle of the day.

931
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,969
Now, that's an interesting theory.
