1
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,612
My child.

2
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,080
My baby.

3
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,209
Finally inside me.

4
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,685
No one will take him from me.

5
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,656
No one can hurt him now.

6
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,320
No one.

7
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,066
Matthieu.

8
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,991
She's doing just fine.

9
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,795
So, Sarah...

10
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,466
have you got a name
picked out for the baby?

11
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,274
All right. We'll admit you
tomorrow morning at 7.

12
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,817
Nothing happens by evening,

13
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,977
then we can always provoke labor.

14
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,781
Don't worry, Sarah.
It'll go just fine.

15
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,329
You have someone to bring you
here tomorrow morning?

16
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,799
Usually, we'd have an ambulance,

17
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,564
but on Christmas morning,
I'm sure you can...

18
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,606
Yes, someone's gonna take me here.

19
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,107
Good.

20
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,338
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll see you tomorrow.

21
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,845
Right.

22
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,349
And enjoy your last night
of peace and quiet.

23
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,159
It won't be long now, huh?

24
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,534
Hmm?

25
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,238
Well, I had four kids.

26
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,279
Your first one, I bet.

27
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,345
It's horrible, the first kid.

28
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:03,614
In my own case,

29
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,954
it took 13 hours to deliver it,

30
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,926
my first baby.

31
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,760
Oh, murder.
I mean murder.

32
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,669
I was in such fucking pain.

33
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:31,479
He put me through all that,
but... he was born dead.

34
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,789
You know very well
that smoking's forbidden here.

35
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,704
Everyone here is so full of shit.

36
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,399
Twat.

37
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,959
I must say,
with what's happening right now,

38
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,621
I'm glad you don't have to work.

39
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,188
It's really nothing
to be freaked out about.

40
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,631
A couple of cars burned.

41
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,566
Well, personally,
I feel better with you home

42
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,228
rather than photographing riots.

43
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,738
It freaks me out less.

44
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,601
So, Jean-Pierre seems like a nice man.

45
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,543
Have you and he gotten to be...

46
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,605
He's my employer.

47
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,684
That's too bad.

48
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:43,950
I was hoping to be introduced
one of these days, you know?

49
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,620
Well, so...

50
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,060
what do you wanna do?

51
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,622
Christmas dinner at your house or at mine?

52
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,328
I'm not hungry, Louise.

53
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,394
I'm sick of eating.

54
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,511
We're going to be all right now.

55
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,013
Look, I need to be alone, Louise.

56
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,450
Go home now, would you, please?

57
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,477
Hello?

58
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,647
Yeah?

59
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,384
What?

60
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,019
I don't give a shit
that he needs headlines.

61
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,858
I don't give a shit.

62
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,921
Go ahead and tell him.

63
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,264
Exactly.

64
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,199
Then you get on it
and figure something out.

65
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,032
Explain it to the guy.

66
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,903
It's burning cars and the whole
fucking mess on page one.

67
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,442
That's the headline.
Nothing else. Thank you.

68
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,708
Right. No. Nothing.

69
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,114
All right. So long.
Merry Christmas.

70
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:59,522
That fucker makes...

71
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,492
gets me fucking irritable.

72
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,788
Bloody mess in the burbs

73
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,626
and not one competent man
to cover it.

74
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,691
So, sweetheart,
how have you been?

75
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,774
It's been rough without you out there.

76
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:20,300
It's just kids having a blast,
'cause they're bored.

77
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,505
Yeah.

78
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,740
Meanwhile, cars are burning,

79
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,373
the cops are on edge,

80
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,213
my reporters are all duds.

81
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,651
Shitty Christmas, you know?

82
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,522
So, my place,
6 in the morning?

83
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,502
- That so?
- Mmm.

84
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,699
I guess that means I better
cut my Christmas Eve short

85
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,537
so I don't keep
the pretty lady waiting.

86
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,906
What about you?

87
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,883
Will you be with your mother tonight?

88
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,113
I don't give a shit about Christmas.

89
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,656
I'd rather be alone.

90
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,485
You won't say that next year.

91
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,394
I can guarantee that.

92
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,776
No, Louise.

93
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,340
No, don't bother coming tomorrow.

94
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,217
I told you, I'll be fine alone.

95
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,053
We've already been through all that.

96
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,022
So you'll come by on Monday.

97
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,524
No, Jean-Pierre's coming to get me.

98
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,866
We just spoke about that, Louise.

99
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,673
I mean, I gave him the keys, yeah.

100
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,776
No. I had enough of this.
I'm gonna turn in.

101
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

102
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,400
Horseshit.

103
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,389
I can't see.

104
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,198
Yeah, who is it?

105
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,360
Hi. Excuse me for disturbing you
on Christmas Eve,

106
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,495
but I got this problem.

107
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,937
Could I come in to make
a quick phone call, please?

108
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,066
Don't you have a cell phone?

109
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,337
My battery's dead.

110
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,538
What exactly happened?

111
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,706
My car broke down on the corner.

112
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:09,085
No. Sorry, but, uh,
my husband works.

113
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:12,385
He's already gone to bed.

114
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,392
I won't make any noise.
It'll just be a minute.

115
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,052
I promise.

116
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,187
Please?

117
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,663
No. I'm really sorry.

118
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,394
Yeah, look, try, uh...
try another house.

119
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,664
There's lots of dinners tonight.

120
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,967
Please, it'll only take a second.

121
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,339
I don't want to be alone
with all this violence.

122
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,776
My husband's sleeping, I told you!

123
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,145
Your husband's not sleeping, Sarah.

124
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,707
He's dead.

125
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,275
What?

126
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,256
Open the door, Sarah.

127
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,151
Who are you?

128
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,923
You know my name. How?

129
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,994
Open the door and you'll know.

130
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,672
I'm calling the police, all right?

131
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

132
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,111
Fine. Go fuck yourself.

133
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,178
Hello?

134
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,990
Look, there's some strange lady
outside my house.

135
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,257
You gotta come really quick.

136
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,196
I can't imagine what she wants.

137
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,632
She knows my name.

138
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,727
She knows all about me. She...

139
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,736
I'm pregnant!

140
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,787
The cops are gonna
be here in five minutes.

141
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,084
Get the hell out of here!

142
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,247
Good evening, ma'am.

143
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,793
Did you call Emergency
about an attempted break-in?

144
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,523
Yeah, that was me.
Come on in.

145
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,465
You live alone?

146
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:56,523
Yes.

147
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,727
Another guy scared of becoming a dad?

148
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,568
Not that simple.

149
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,403
And who is this woman?

150
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,464
I don't know,

151
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,568
but she knows my name.

152
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,478
Which is on the letterbox right outside.

153
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,712
All about who I am.

154
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,342
You're sure it was a woman?

155
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,404
You get a look at the face, or...

156
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,076
No. She stuck to the shadows.

157
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,641
I mean, I tried to get a picture,

158
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,552
but this is all I could get.

159
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:51,611
Yeah, right.

160
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,920
Not much we can do with that.

161
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,434
Nobody around.

162
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,101
Don't worry.
I'm sure she left.

163
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,770
Look, I'm gonna lock you in for the night.

164
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,644
We'll notify the unit on patrol tonight.

165
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,345
We've got everyone
on duty already, but...

166
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,387
we're gonna post a bulletin.

167
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,150
They'll call around
in the course of the night

168
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,282
to make sure you're okay.

169
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,327
Thanks.

170
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,664
Pretty empty around here
for Christmas Eve.

171
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,600
That's how this neighborhood is.

172
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,103
- Good night, ma'am.
- Bye.

173
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,469
- So long.
- Don't worry. She won't be back.

174
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,532
Have a good night.

175
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,477
Which has been going on

176
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,353
since last November 27th

177
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,824
and the accidental death
of two French citizens

178
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,861
from immigrant families.

179
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,226
Rioting has since spread

180
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,289
throughout underprivileged areas
of the Paris suburbs

181
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,357
as well as other major cities.

182
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,801
Mass transit passengers
as well as police

183
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,771
and firefighters have been injured.

184
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,637
Over 300 communities have been affected.

185
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,371
4,900 vehicles set ablaze

186
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:23,881
while scores of businesses,
homes and places of worship...

187
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,854
More than 2,000 immigrants
involved in the riots...

188
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,859
What do you want,
you pain in my ass?

189
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:40,426
The interior secretary's
inflammatory comments,

190
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,398
much quoted in the press
this morning,

191
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,061
exasperated an alre...

192
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,530
Hello. It's me again, Jean-Pierre.

193
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,971
Well, look, you're feeding
your face, I guess.

194
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,771
Something pretty weird
happened tonight,

195
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,835
so I was hoping that tomorrow

196
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,675
you could enhance
a couple of shots of mine.

197
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,943
Right.
See you in the morning.

198
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,787
No!

199
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,608
Sarah?

200
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,990
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you.

201
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,326
Jean-Pierre Montevant,
Sarah's chief editor.

202
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,968
Sarah's on the way to...
to my Christmas dinner.

203
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,663
I stopped here
to see if she was a bit,

204
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,138
you know, worried with
this suburban violence.

205
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,572
I'm supposed to pick her up...

206
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,735
so she left me her keys...

207
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,902
tomorrow morning.

208
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:24,607
Anyway, I see her mom
got here... before me.

209
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,014
When a daughter needs,
her mother knows.

210
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,220
Right.

211
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,849
Well, so everything's okay?

212
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,655
She went to bed an hour ago.

213
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,097
I better get going.

214
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,759
See you later.

215
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,462
Oh, please don't run off.
Will you have a drink?

216
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,732
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

217
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,706
Do say yes.

218
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,827
So, Mrs. Scarangelo,
looking forward to being a grandmother?

219
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,057
It took her hours to fall asleep.

220
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,159
Don't wake her.

221
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,431
Oh, of course.

222
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,972
You're right.
I'm sorry.

223
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,406
I'm glad she's holding up well.

224
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,467
She went through hell
after the accident.

225
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,775
Of course, so did I.

226
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:32,179
These past few months
have been awful.

227
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,115
But I know the birth will save us.

228
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,119
Another drink?

229
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,990
What the hell?

230
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,693
My little photographer.

231
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,426
Always taking her pictures
and leaving them around.

232
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,298
When did she take this one?
Have any idea?

233
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,961
Because I'm pretty sure it's

234
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,598
one of these Sarah called me about.

235
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,568
Really?
What did she have to say?

236
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,703
Something was bothering her.
There was a picture

237
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,247
she wanted to try...

238
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,475
to enhance.

239
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,176
Enhance?

240
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,550
I'm not sure what it's about.
She might have wanted...

241
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,954
to just enlarge it
or to try and clean it up.

242
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,589
Like this face, for example.

243
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:02,099
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

244
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,902
Where's Sarah?

245
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,204
Maybe you should tell us who you are.

246
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,476
You just barge into somebody's house?

247
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,242
Keep your voice down.
Sarah's sleep...

248
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,249
Where's my daughter?

249
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,152
Well, then, who are you?

250
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,921
Pictures of you.

251
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,768
Sarah?

252
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,097
Everything all right up there?

253
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,121
Mom...

254
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,957
Mommy!

255
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,456
Mommy.

256
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,436
Sarah?

257
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,899
Mommy.

258
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Help me.
Help me. Help me.

259
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,644
Shit!

260
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,052
Who the fuck are you?

261
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,831
Open your door.

262
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,493
Open it!

263
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,700
Open the door.

264
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,939
Why me?

265
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:10,650
I want one.

266
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,260
What kind of a man would fuck
a maniac like you?

267
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,733
Open it, Sarah!

268
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:26,003
Don't be afraid.

269
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:29,409
You don't want that child.
I'll take good care of him.

270
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,119
What are you talking about?

271
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,975
We just stop off to see

272
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,042
if the nice lady is all tucked in, okay?

273
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,610
Then we'll take our nightly jackpot winner

274
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:12,677
to the station,

275
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:14,587
Mr. Abdel Shani Asadi.

276
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,785
Abdel Hanusian.
You got the wrong guy, man.

277
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,055
I swear.
I mean, I'm not into Molotov cocktails.

278
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:21,563
Anyway, if I'm gonna go torch some cars,

279
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,862
I'm not so crazy,
I'm gonna have my I.D. In my wallet.

280
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,339
Fuck.

281
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,845
- I wasn't doing anything.
- Quit trying to confuse the issue.

282
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,447
First, we'll see
if Mrs. Scarangelo's head is on her pillow,

283
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:23,254
then we bring
this misunderstood child to get booked,

284
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,454
then we go get his homeys
back in the hood.

285
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,588
Can't let him spend Christmas
all alone in the lockup

286
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,063
with nobody else around.

287
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,463
Your friends are out there.

288
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,661
We're gonna go get them,
and you guys can party down.

289
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:34,829
- I don't observe it, so fuck Christmas.
- Whoa.

290
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,999
Well, hey, right.
Doesn't observe Christmas.

291
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:41,442
Excuse me. Hello?
How are you, babe?

292
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:54,217
Think his girlfriend
is such a pain in the balls?

293
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,486
Maybe. Meantime, he's
in the car with the heat on.

294
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,023
I mean, no.
We're going off duty.

295
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,689
We just gotta check out this woman.

296
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,357
We'll be back right after, you know?

297
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,128
Yes, I love you.
Come on. Quit it.

298
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:06,499
Busting your chops, right?

299
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,767
Wait. Hold on.
Shut your face, all right?

300
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,829
Yeah.

301
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,670
No, I'm talking to a perp in the car,

302
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,176
not to you.

303
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:56,446
Joy to the world

304
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,750
Mrs. Scarangelo, it's the police.

305
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,756
- Hi. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

306
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:12,165
Just stopped by to see if you're okay.

307
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,863
Our duty log says
a woman was harassing you.

308
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,974
No, it's been hours.
I'm okay.

309
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,476
Don't hesitate to call us
if she comes back.

310
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:23,843
Yeah, sure.

311
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:29,015
Excuse me.
What's that noise?

312
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,850
It's the spin cycle
on my ancient washing machine.

313
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,981
- All right.
- Cheaper to run at night, huh?

314
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,183
- Yeah.
- Okay.

315
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,021
- Well, you have a good one.
- Right.

316
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,789
- Thanks.
- Merry Christmas. So long.

317
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,454
Bye, Officer.

318
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,667
God, a cup of coffee about now.

319
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:48,601
Hey.

320
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,066
No, I hear you, I hear you.

321
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,405
Did you forget something?

322
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,841
One stupid detail.

323
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,105
Just wondering what
you were gonna name him.

324
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,172
Who?

325
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,274
Your child.

326
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:12,244
Watch her.

327
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,492
Holy fuck!

328
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,331
Arrest her!
Arrest her!

329
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:28,963
Hands behind you!
On the ground! Fast!

330
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,009
It's a fucking war zone.

331
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,878
It's the police.

332
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:41,907
Don't move!

333
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,091
All right.

334
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,285
I'm gonna remove the scissors.

335
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,384
Don't move.

336
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,960
Open the door!
Open the door!

337
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,841
No! No!

338
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:13,306
All right. All right.
You can make it.

339
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,442
Open the door.

340
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,996
Open it!
Open the fucking door!

341
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,100
Oh, my fucking God!

342
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,177
Sorry. Gotta go.

343
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,311
You're gonna have to come along.

344
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,481
- What?
- Something went bad.

345
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,600
That's police brutality, man.

346
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:06,397
You're putting me on a leash like a mutt?

347
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,733
Put a sock in it and come on.

348
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,899
- Hey, chill out a second.
- Move it.

349
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,887
- Officer, let me out of here, please!
- Here, take this.

350
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,129
Let me go!

351
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:55,240
We gotta get out of this fucking place!

352
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:57,183
Get the hell in here!

353
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:59,517
You all right?
All right. Just calm down.

354
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:02,524
All right?

355
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,457
Lt'll be all right.
It'll be all right.

356
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,690
You, get it together!

357
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:10,494
It's fine.
I'll be back in a second.

358
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:13,058
Just stay there.
You. You!

359
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,536
- You know how to use that?
- No.

360
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:18,096
You arm it here, okay?
And fire.

361
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,438
Yo! Just point
and pull the trigger, okay?

362
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,104
- Please let me out of this awful place!
- You're coming with me.

363
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:25,841
I'll be right back.
Stay here.

364
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,224
- What happened? Huh?
- Is she gone?

365
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:10,384
Yeah, she's gone.

366
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,121
She went out the window
of your bedroom.

367
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:14,857
She's still here! She's still here!

368
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,922
No, calm down.
Calm down. Christ.

369
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,692
You got a circuit breaker?

370
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,635
Know where it is?

371
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:24,900
Look at me, now.
Know where it is?

372
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:28,205
Downstairs?
All right. Let's go.

373
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,111
One second.
I'm gonna give you a gun.

374
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:37,949
Take this. Take it!

375
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:43,191
Careful. Oh, shit!

376
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,591
Got any bandages?
You got any bandages?

377
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:46,924
- There...
- Yes?

378
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,691
There? In the drawer?

379
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,528
Here. Hold this.

380
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,966
Take the flashlight.
Hold it up!

381
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,705
I can't see. Here.

382
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,812
Hold the light up, for Christ sake.

383
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,950
It's all right. Relax.

384
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,750
- Take off the handcuffs!
- Shut your face!

385
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:17,259
Hold this, okay?
Hold the light steady.

386
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,491
I have to put the breaker back on, okay?

387
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:23,191
Wait for me here.

388
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,598
Hold still.

389
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,398
I killed my mother.

390
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,302
- I killed my mother.
- It's all right. Calm down now.

391
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:31,931
Man, we gotta get out of this place!

392
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,498
Shit!

393
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:41,038
I'm gonna call for an ambulance
and backup from my car, okay?

394
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:42,948
You'll be all right.

395
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:46,652
All right.

396
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,089
All right.
Put this on.

397
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,024
Can you walk? Yeah?

398
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:54,563
Okay, so you'll wait in the bedroom.
Give me your hand.

399
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,259
Give me your hand!
Help her up.

400
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,263
Okay. Can you walk?

401
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:02,668
Okay?

402
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:07,335
You all right?

403
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,378
Be right back.

404
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,112
Let's go. Walk.

405
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,953
Hold the light.

406
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:30,920
All right.
Once I get the lights on, I'll let you go.

407
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,928
Once you're outside,
find every cop you can.

408
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,656
Hold the fucking light!
There's nobody here!

409
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:43,004
Don't shine it in my eyes!

410
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,342
- Oh, fuck!
- The flashbulb!

411
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,902
- What?
- The flashbulb!

412
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:53,913
What kind of crap is this?

413
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,054
Back up.

414
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:04,184
Back up!

415
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:28,148
Hey, lady!

416
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:30,276
Hey, lady!
She's still here!

417
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:34,055
Come on! Get up!
Come on! Get up!

418
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:36,489
Fuck!

419
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:42,294
Where the fuck are your keys?

420
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:55,439
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

421
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,031
Sarah.

422
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,525
Where are you hiding, bitch?

423
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:50,107
You can kill me again, Sarah.

424
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:02,416
You already did once.

425
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:08,796
My child.

426
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:11,264
My baby.

427
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,927
Finally inside me.

428
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:16,471
No one will take him from me.

429
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:18,904
No one can hurt him now.

430
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:20,908
No one.

431
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:41,153
They told me that
there were no survivors.

432
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,497
Officer?

433
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,703
Officer?

434
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

435
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:52,556
The baby's coming.

436
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:57,027
The baby!

437
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,527
Shh!

438
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:04,898
Mommy!

439
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:07,464
Shh!

440
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:12,239
Calm down.

441
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:14,282
I'm right here.

442
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:22,083
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

443
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,423
I think it's stuck.

444
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:57,618
- Mommy!
- Shh!

445
01:15:57,686 --> 01:16:00,086
Mommy!

446
