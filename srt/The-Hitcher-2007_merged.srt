00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,143
<i>Hello?</i>

3
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,777
- You still asleep?
- <i>No, I'm not...</i>

4
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,378
Get up. I'm outside.

5
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,080
<i>Why? What time is it?</i>

6
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,523
It's time to go.
Come on, hurry up.
You're late.

7
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,839
- Hey.
- Hi!

8
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,414
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

9
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,416
- Good morning.
- Morning.

10
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,508
Nice pj's.

11
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,688
Let's go.

12
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:14,755
We're going.

13
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,626
I know that look.

14
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,030
You got to pee.

15
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,196
No, I don't.

16
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,566
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I do.

17
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,068
Babe, we just left.

18
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,168
I know. I'm sorry.

19
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,576
We haven't even been
six blocks.

20
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,444
Well, I got to go.

21
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,642
- Okay.
- I'll be fast.

22
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,048
- Okay.
- Okay.

23
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,998
- Can we go?
- Yes.

24
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,802
You sure? Positive?

25
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,671
Yeah. Come on.

26
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:52,853
Gross.

27
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,373
Here. Hand me that water.

28
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,510
- Grab the wheel.
- Whoa, whoa.

29
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,567
Come on.

30
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,825
Yeah. That's impressive.

31
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,054
Thank you.

32
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,644
I'm excited
for the girls to meet you.

33
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,645
I can't wait to meet them.

34
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,027
Are your friends
gonna like me?

35
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
They're gonna love you.
Look out!

36
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,705
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

37
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,837
Did you hit him?

38
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,006
What the fuck
was that guy doing
in the road?

39
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,276
Did you hit him?

40
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,750
No. I don't know.
I don't know. Shit.

41
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,780
You okay?

42
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,121
Yeah. We almost killed him.

43
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,388
I'm gonna go see
if he's okay.

44
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,896
What? Why?

45
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,329
Grace, we're in
the middle of nowhere.

46
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,388
We can't just leave
that guy out here.

47
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,456
We gotta see if he's okay.

48
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,092
That guy is just
standing there, Jim.

49
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,794
He's not even moving.

50
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,904
What kind of freak
just stands
in the middle of the road

51
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,942
and doesn't even flinch?

52
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,072
Oh, man.
He's coming over here.

53
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,272
I'm gonna go talk to him.

54
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,373
No, please. Let's just
call somebody for help, okay?
Let's go.

55
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,146
I don't want to
pick up a stranger
out here.

56
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,181
All right. All right.

57
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,282
What's wrong?

58
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,794
Engine's flooded.

59
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,435
Come on. He's coming up here.

60
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,564
Come on...

61
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,465
Fuck.

62
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,404
Come on, start! Come on!

63
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,876
No signal.

64
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,448
This isn't right.

65
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,191
I'm sure someone else
will come along.

66
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:47,191
Yeah. I hope so.

67
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,946
You know, I never did
a full 360 before.

68
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,074
First one.

69
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,952
Just keep your eyes
on the road.

70
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,484
I will.

71
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,841
Man, raining out there
pretty hard, huh?

72
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:29,932
Yeah.

73
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,575
Hey, Doritos or Cheetos?

74
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,337
Cheetos.

75
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,645
Ding Dongs or Twinkies?

76
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,084
Ding Dongs.

77
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,659
Damn. Lady knows
her processed foods, huh?

78
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:49,888
Yeah.

79
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,090
Pump number seven.

80
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,496
Hey, there's a guy broke down
a few miles back.

81
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,592
Can you send someone
with a tow, or...

82
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,735
Yeah, that's a no-can-do.

83
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,240
That's Buford's truck
out there.

84
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,108
Probably be back
around 7:00.

85
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,305
All right.

86
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,810
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

87
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,910
- Good.
- Oh.

88
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,820
You need a key, ma'am.
And there you go.

89
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,584
I'm just joking with you.

90
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,322
Thanks.

91
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,295
That's a car, ain't it?

92
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,063
What?

93
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,330
442.

94
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,802
That's a bad-ass
fuckin' ride, man.

95
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,968
Regular little
pussy wagon, huh?

96
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:42,803
Right.

97
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,712
What do you drive?

98
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,115
Been fixing up this Camaro
in my back yard.

99
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,053
Guys want to take
a little break
from the drive,

100
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,351
you can come on over.

101
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,655
That's all right.
We got to get
on the road, man.

102
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,251
I got a couple of donkeys
in the back yard.

103
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,524
Me and my cousin
raise those things.

104
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,565
I got kicked in the eye.

105
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:00,656
That's why I got
a lazy eye and shit.

106
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:01,825
I tried to milk
that son of a bitch.

107
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,027
You can't milk
a fucking donkey, though.

108
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,194
You know what I'm saying?

109
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,259
Yeah.

110
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,532
All right. Anyway.

111
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,212
I'm okay.

112
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,656
- There you go.
- Thanks.

113
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,289
- Hi.
- Hey.

114
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,989
You have a motel nearby?

115
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:45,362
There's one in Tatum,
about 15 miles north of here.

116
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,566
Hey, I bet you he's that guy
who was having car troubles.

117
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:57,112
Yeah. Hey, sorry
for taking off back there.

118
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,511
That was you?

119
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,075
Yeah.

120
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,710
Don't worry about it.

121
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,779
I wouldn't have
picked me up, either.

122
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,718
You still headed north?

123
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,322
Yeah.

124
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,767
Would you mind giving me
a ride to the motel?

125
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,801
Yeah, okay.

126
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,270
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

127
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:23,934
What's going on?

128
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,636
This is the guy
we almost hit.

129
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,008
He can't get a tow
until morning,

130
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,242
so I told him
we could give him a ride
to the motel.

131
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,707
Hi.

132
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,149
I'm John Ryder.

133
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,510
Grace.

134
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,489
Nice to meet you, Grace.

135
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,538
So, where you from, man?

136
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,136
All over.

137
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,367
What do you do?

138
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,805
I'm between jobs. You know?

139
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,480
Yeah.
My dad changed jobs a lot
when I was a kid.

140
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:09,612
Yeah?

141
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,349
Yeah, he's a salesman.

142
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,447
It's Ford trucks now,

143
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,926
but he's sold
everything from Buicks
to farm equipment.

144
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,793
That's probably what
I'll end up doing, too.

145
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,435
Where you heading?

146
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,503
Lake Havasu. Spring break.

147
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,643
Sounds like fun.

148
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,584
Yeah.

149
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,986
I hope so.

150
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,390
She's a good-looking girl.

151
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,334
Thank you.

152
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,172
How long
you been fuckin' her?

153
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,108
Excuse me?

154
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,015
It's a simple question.

155
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,284
How long you been fucking
your wife?

156
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,390
I don't have one.

157
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,938
Well, what's with
the wedding ring, then?

158
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,701
It helps strangers
think I'm trustworthy.

159
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,414
Aren't you?

160
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,513
No.

161
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:57,894
Hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

162
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,761
All right, you know what?
That's it.
Ride's over, pal.

163
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,162
Keep driving.

164
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,199
All right. Okay? Okay?

165
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,085
Look, we don't want
any trouble, all right?

166
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,317
We just...
What do you want?

167
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,381
We got money.

168
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,483
I don't want your money.

169
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,085
What do you want?
You want the car?

170
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,131
I don't want your car.

171
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on, man.
What do you want, man?

172
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,610
Stop!
Hey, what are you doing?

173
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,371
Jim.

174
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,677
If you fucking hurt her,
you're a fucking dead man!

175
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:50,874
Jim.

176
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,881
I want you to stop me.

177
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,748
Don't hurt her, all right?
Jim!

178
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,287
Then stop me.

179
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,517
How? You're the one
with the fuckin' knife.

180
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:03,356
All you have to say
is four little words.

181
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,922
"I want to die."

182
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,131
Say what?

183
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:13,463
"I want to die."

184
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:14,796
Don't say it.

185
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,898
For your sake, he better.

186
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:20,838
You want her to die?

187
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:21,971
No. No.

188
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,241
Say it!

189
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,513
Come on. I...

190
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,153
I...

191
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,424
Want...

192
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:40,887
Want...

193
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,092
To...

194
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,594
To...

195
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,999
Die.

196
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I don't want to die!

197
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,475
Get his door! Get the door!

198
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,540
I'm going to kick
this motherfucker out!

199
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,321
Get the door!

200
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,421
Get out of my car!

201
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,053
Fucking psycho fuck!

202
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,733
Fuck you, asshole!

203
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,244
You okay?

204
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,511
Yeah.

205
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,430
Hey, hey, come on.

206
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,131
It's okay.

207
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:54,268
Hey, come on.
We're okay. It's okay, huh?

208
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,035
It's okay.

209
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,914
We should call the cops.

210
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,611
Okay.

211
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,998
What is it? What is it?

212
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,495
My phone's gone.

213
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,629
<i>Well, as we</i>
<i>come up on 4:00, I've got</i>

214
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,137

Grace? Grace?

218
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,760
Morning.

219
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,428
Jim, I just wanna go home.

220
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:43,902
Come on.

221
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,140
We'll stop in the next town,
we'll get some food,
I'll talk to the cops,

222
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,311
and we'll be drinking beers
with your friends
by tonight.

223
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,948
Besides, we got one hell
of a story to tell.

224
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,159
Yeah, you just wanna
tell all my friends
you saved my life.

225
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,489
Yeah.

226
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,284
Let's go eat.

227
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,785
Look at this.
It is a beautiful day.

228
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,287
Yeah.

229
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,419
You ever think
about having kids?

230
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,287
Sometimes. I don't know.

231
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,956
Yeah, I guess, eventually.

232
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,344
Oh, my God!

233
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,206
Pull up, pull up.

234
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,751
Shit!
We gotta warn these people.

235
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,097
Sir, you got to stop!

236
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,666
Hey! Hey!

237
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,834
The guy in the back
of your car is crazy!

238
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,303
He pulled a knife on us!

239
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,930
- Stop the car, sir!
- He's dangerous.

240
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,232
Pull your car over!

241
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,675
The guy in the back
of your car is crazy.

242
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,876
He's dangerous!
He has a knife!

243
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,047
- Pull over! He tried to...
- Oh, shit!

244
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:39,105
What?

245
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,232
Grace.

246
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,063
- Okay.
- Oh, fuck.

247
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,806
We're fine.

248
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,512
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

249
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:10,939
Yeah.

250
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,643
They didn't stop!

251
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,829
We gotta walk.

252
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,197
Give me a minute.

253
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,395
All right.

254
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,580
Fuck!

255
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,273
Fuck!

256
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,486
How did he find us?

257
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,684
I don't know.

258
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,357
Maybe he wasn't
looking for us.

259
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,164
Maybe it was
just bad luck.

260
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,112
What about
those people?

261
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,077
It's gonna be okay.

262
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,352
No, it isn't.

263
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,216
Hey.

264
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,449
Oh, God.

265
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:02,652
Hey!

266
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:03,920
Stop!

267
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,829
- Hey!
- Stop. Stop!

268
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,421
Stop! Please!

269
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,898
- Please!
- Please stop!

270
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,140
Nobody stops for strangers.

271
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,685
Jim.

272
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:38,890
Oh, no.

273
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,466
You stay behind me.

274
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,342
He might still be inside.
Just stay here.

275
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:11,688
You don't want to see this.

276
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:12,855
Why?

277
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,092
Just stay there. Please.

278
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,000
What is it?

279
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,773
Don't you come over here,
all right?

280
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,644
Just... Please! Please!

281
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,261
Oh, sir! Sir!

282
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,465
Oh, Grace, Grace,
this guy's really bleeding.

283
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,164
I think we got to
leave the knife in.
I don't know.

284
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,231
What do we do?
What do we do?

285
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,606
Open the back door.
Can you clear it out?

286
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,804
We gotta get him
to a hospital.

287
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:01,971
Okay.

288
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,906
Come on, Grace!

289
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,172
Sir?

290
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,240
Okay.

291
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,683
It's all right, sir.

292
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,584
Come on, pick him up.
Pick him up.

293
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,020
Come on, you gotta just...

294
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,522
Sir?

295
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,956
Sir, stay with me,
all right?

296
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,425
I'm gonna get him
in the back seat.

297
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,086
I'll get his legs in.

298
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,926
Okay, go on. Come on.

299
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,862
You gotta drive.
Sir, please...

300
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:22,957
Oh, God...

301
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,023
Grace!

302
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,019
Be with me in this darkness,
dear Lord.

303
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,685
We're gonna get you help.
Okay, sir?

304
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:51,922
Is she okay?

305
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,725
No. She is not okay.

306
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,260
You sure she's not okay?

307
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,662
She's not okay.

308
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,003
Try not to move, sir. Please.

309
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,268
How could somebody do this?
You don't just kill a family.

310
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,502
Grace...

311
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,971
- What the fuck?
- What...

312
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,240
Oh, my God. It's him! Fuck!

313
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:12,942
Just keep driving.

314
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,075
I'm driving. I'm driving.

315
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,681
What does he want?

316
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,782
I don't know. We pushed him
out of a fucking car!
What do you think?

317
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:24,056
Yeah? What were we
supposed to do?
Let him kill us?

318
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,799
Can't this thing go
any faster? Just drive!

319
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,529
I'm trying, okay?

320
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,865
Come on! Come on!

321
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,717
Come on.
I don't wanna die out here.

322
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,857
What do you think?
What's he doing?

323
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,058
What do you think
he's doing?

324
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,623
Where'd he go?

325
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,634
Oh, shit.

326
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:12,608
We gotta get this guy
to a hospital, Grace.

327
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,148
Grace, go inside
and call the police,
all right? Get some towels.

328
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,387
- I'm gonna stay here
with him.
- Okay.

329
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,655
Okay.

330
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,030
Sir, we're gonna
get you some help.

331
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,565
Okay? Okay?

332
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,542
Can you call 911, please?
It's an emergency!

333
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,201
What's going on?

334
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,308
Towels. I need towels.

335
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:49,504
Paper towels are
in the bathroom.

336
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,173
- Where is your bathroom?
- It's over there.

337
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,341
Thank you.

338
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,556
Sustain me in the darkness

339
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,030
which overwhelms me.

<i>Torrance County</i>

00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,799
Marlene, it's Beth
down at EI Dorado's.

00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,000
<i>Oh, hi, Beth.</i>

343
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,600
You better get Harlan

344
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,346
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

345
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,416
Bless my family and friends
as I depart from them.

346
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:36,575
Sir.

347
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,256
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

348
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:40,689
I will fear no evil.

349
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,812
- Stop right there!
- What?

350
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:43,581
Put your hands
behind your back!

351
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,848
Freeze!

352
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,021
Let me see your hands!
Get out of the car!

353
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,258
No, no, no.

354
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,421
We're the ones
who called you! Tell him!

355
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:53,989
- Quiet! Move.
- No, no...

356
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,123
You're under arrest.
Come on, move!

357
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,064
No, you don't understand.
You have to help
those people.

358
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,898
You have the right
to remain silent.

359
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,962
Anything you say can
and may be used against you
in a court of law.

360
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,803
- I just saw him right there.
- You have the right
to an attorney.

361
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,069
If you cannot

362
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,235
She didn't do anything!

363
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,856
This guy you picked up,
he give you a name?

364
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,833
I told you,
he said his name
was John Ryder.

365
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,830
Sit in the chair, please.

366
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,946
Young lady, have a seat.

367
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,544
<i>Where was</i>
<i>this gas station located?</i>

368
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,682
<i>I don't know.</i>

369
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,452
<i>God, I don't even know</i>
<i>where I am.</i>

370
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,894
<i>Tatum.</i>
<i>We saw signs for Tatum.</i>

371
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:02,990
<i>Tatum.</i>

372
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,262
<i>Did anybody see you</i>
<i>pick this guy up?</i>

373
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,372
<i>Yeah, the clerk</i>
<i>at the gas station saw him.</i>

374
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,239
<i>Clerk got a name?</i>

375
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,836
<i>I didn't ask him his name.</i>

376
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,782
<i>I'm trying to help you.</i>

377
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,317
Put your hands
through the opening.

378
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,886
Look at me.
I didn't kill that family.
All right?

379
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,892
I was trying
to help that guy.
Come on.

380
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,890
Hey.

381
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,194
Hey, come on!
I don't need to be
down here, man!

382
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,168
I was trying
to help that family!

383
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,237
I was trying to help them!

384
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,399
<i>And I'm telling you</i>
<i>the truth, okay?</i>

385
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,975
<i>I opened the door,</i>
<i>Jim pushed him out of the car.</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

386
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,615
<i>Marlene,</i>
<i>this is unit seven...</i>

387
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,016
<i>Marlene, are you</i>
<i>gonna answer that?</i>

388
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,577
<i>Are... Are you kidding?</i>

389
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,555
<i>Why are you</i>
<i>wasting your time</i>
<i>in here with me?</i>

390
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,524
<i>You should be out there</i>
<i>looking for him.</i>

391
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,593
<i>He is gonna kill</i>
<i>more people.</i>

392
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,128
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

393
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,829
Come on, man,
you can't leave me
down here like this!

394
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,381
Hello?

395
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:34,820
I know somebody is in there.

396
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,452
<i>I know that you can hear me!</i>

397
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,756
<i>Come on!</i>

398
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,528
<i>I didn't do anything!</i>

399
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:47,468
Hello?

400
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:50,967

402
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,612
Just let me talk to Grace.

403
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,614
I just want to talk to Grace.

404
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,969

Why are you doing this?

416
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:47,919
You're a smart kid.
You can figure it out.

417

Jim?

Jim!

423
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,271
Jim, answer me!

424
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:18,845
I've got a gun!

425
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:34,898
Grace!

Everybody's dead.
Everybody upstairs.

428
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,443
Come on. Come on.
Get me out of here.
Get me out of here.

429
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,676
Okay, okay, okay.
Hold this.

430
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,284
Light. I need light.

431
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,384
Okay.

432
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:28,989
Come on.

433
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,173
You think they got him?

434
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,335
I think we need to go back.

435
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,944
Come on.
We're not going back there.

436
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,078
We need to get help.

437
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,980
He killed the help.

438
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,384
Here. Give me the gun.

439
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,890
What?

440
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,550
Give me the gun.

441
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,949
Fine.

442
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,555
We should have gone home
when we had the chance.

443
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,530
Come on. Don't blame this
on me, all right?
It's not my fault.

444
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,588
I'm not.

445
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:10,757
Yes, you are.

446
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,329
Well, why'd you have to
offer the guy a ride?

447
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:16,202
I didn't offer him a ride!
He asked for one.

448
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,865
All right?
That stupid hick clerk
brought it up.

449
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:18,931
And you agreed!

450
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,499
Yeah! Yeah.

451
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,042
What else was I
supposed to do?

452
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,817
How was I supposed to know
he was a sick fuck lunatic?

453
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,486
You could have
just listened to me.

454
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,003
You okay?

455
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,537
- You okay?
- Yeah.

<i>This is Albuquerque SP.</i>

<i>He'll show up</i>

464
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,367

<i>Is that confirmed</i>
<i>they passed along</i>
<i>that suspect description</i>

466
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,182
<i>to Arizona DPS?</i>

467
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,278
There's another one
over here.

468
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,583
Right.

469
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,451
<i>Yeah, that is confirmed.</i>

470
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,023
My goodness.

471
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,442
How old did you say
these kids are?

472
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:03,878
Early 20s.

473
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:22,421
The boy,
you said he was locked up
downstairs, right?

474
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:23,727
Yes, sir.

475
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,064
And the girl,
she was interrogated
inside here?

476
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:30,497
Yes, sir.

477
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,371
Then who the hell did that?

478
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:35,500
Get me air support now.

479
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,274
I want eyes in the sky.

480
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,115
Looks like we have
a third suspect.

481
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:54,824
Hello?

482
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:57,961
Hello?

483
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,268
Hello?

484
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:07,837
Hello?

485
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,405
- Jim?
- What?

486
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:17,615
Come on,
we'll get one of
these cars.

487
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,984
- Jim, get down!
- Oh, fuck.

488
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,344
- Is there a way out?
- No!

489
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,440
- See him?
- No.

490
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,850
He comes through
that door, he's dead!

491
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,000
Twenty-one years old.

492
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,839
They didn't do it, boys.

493
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:17,278
College students.
They didn't do this.

494
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:18,609
They didn't.

495
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,511
You see him?

496
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,348
No, I don't see him.

497
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,147
I don't know
where he went.

498
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:30,889
Oh, God. Jim... Jim...

499
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:33,857
- What?
- There's a cop.

500
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,895
It's the cop from the diner.

501
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:42,299
We got to talk to him.

502
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,397
No. No. No.
He thinks we did it.

503
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,410
Only chance we have
to get out of here.

504
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,017
All right.
You take this, all right?

505
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,454
Okay.

506
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:01,582
- All right?
- Okay.

507
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:02,682
I'm gonna go talk to him.

508
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,250
You just watch. Watch.

509
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:05,522
Okay.

510
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,040
Officer, please,
you don't understand!
We're all in danger here.

511
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,075
You aren't going anywhere
this time, son.

512
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,132
Please, Officer!

513
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,234
This is SO-235.

514
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,539
I have the male suspect
in custody.

515
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,548
<i>I repeat, I have</i>
<i>the male suspect in custody.</i>

516
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:28,015
The female remains at large.

517
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,852
Get off him.

518
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,623
State 531.

519
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,319
We have a support unit
just minutes away.

520
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:38,383
<i>Do you copy?</i>

521
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:39,553
Come on. Get up.

522
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,154
Take it easy.

523
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,822
Let's not go do
anything stupid.

524
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,128
Just stay calm.

525
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,496
I am calm.

526
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:46,968
Grace.

527
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,665
Hey! Just keep your hands
in the air, please.

528
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,674
Grace, you don't need
to do this.

529
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,266
Jim, take it.

530
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,078
Sorry about this, man.

531
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,440
We have to
get out of here.

532
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:04,548
We got to go. Come on,
let's get in the car.

533
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:06,579
Please, sir. Please.

534
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,056
- Turn around, please, sir.
- Okay. Okay.

535
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,595
Okay.

536
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,028
What the fuck
are you doing?

537
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,826
What am I supposed to do?
We have to get out of here.

538
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,059
I know,
but this is crazy.

539
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,795
I know.

540
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:20,200
Just go...

541
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,702
Please get in the car, sir.

542
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,644
Listen. Just take it easy.

543
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,509
- Just give me the gun.
- No. You don't understand.

544
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:34,573
We don't have time
for this.

545
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:35,640
We have to
get out of here.

546
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:36,777
Grace, we got to go.

547
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:40,221
Come on, please just
get in the car. Get in.

548
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What did you do?
- Freeze!
- I didn't do it!

549
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,394
Get in the car!
Get in the car!

550
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,096
We got to get out of here!

551
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,376
SO-236.
We have an officer down!

552
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,180
We have an officer down!

553
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,214
<i>Female suspect shot Edwards.</i>

554
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:14,587
She took off
in a Torrance County
Sheriff's vehicle!

555
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:33,236
What the fuck
happened back there?

556
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,073
It must've been him!

557
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,478
He's not going to stop, is he?

558
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:41,309
No.

559
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,290
He's framing us.

560
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,091
No. No. If he was doing that,
he would have stopped

561
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,222
when he killed the family.

562
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,288
Then what does he want?

563
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,628
I don't know!

564
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,670
<i>Suspects armed</i>
<i>and considered dangerous.</i>

565
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,781
<i>Lieutenant, we are</i>
<i>in pursuit of the suspects</i>
<i>on Highway 285.</i>

566
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:16,485
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>They are armed and dangerous.</i>

567
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,680
<i>How long till</i>
<i>my air support is 10-97?</i>

568
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:21,951
<i>This is Air 2.</i>
<i>We're on their 20,</i>
<i>but don't have a visual.</i>

569
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,083
Get on that thing
and tell them

570
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,593
that he's back there
in the trailer park.

571
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,356
Get on that thing.

572
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:28,657
Hello?

573
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:31,864
<i>Is this on?</i>
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

574
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,233
Oh, shit!

575
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:40,133
<i>Air 2 to base.</i>
<i>We've spotted the suspects.</i>

576
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:42,336
<i>We're joining</i>
<i>ground pursuit.</i>

577
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,312
This is bad.

578
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,542
<i>Grace Andrews</i>
<i>and Jim Halsey.</i>

579
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,615
This is
Lieutenant Esteridge

580
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,380
with the New Mexico
State Police Department.

581
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:51,751
How y'all doing?

582
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,518
Listen, we're really
not too good, okay?

583
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:56,286
The guy that shot that cop
is back there

584
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,988
in the trailer park
that we just pulled out of,
off of that dirt road.

585
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,791
Well, now, you see,
I have an officer down,

586
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:02,525
and I have a witness
says that you did it.

587
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,260
<i>So you'll pull</i>
<i>your car over.</i>

588
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,928
If you feel like
talking about it,
we can talk about it then.

589
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:07,993
Okay, what do we do?

590
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,060
Just tell him
that you didn't do it.

591
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,504
Listen to me.

592
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:13,134
<i>I did not shoot that cop!</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

593
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,644
I didn't shoot him,
we didn't kill that family,
we haven't done anything.

594
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,646
When are you gonna
believe us?

595
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:21,081
Now, now, now, you don't
make the rules around here,
you see? I do.

596
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,915
<i>So, why don't you</i>
<i>just pull over</i>
<i>so we'll chat about it</i>

597
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,084
<i>before this thing gets</i>
<i>out of control, okay?</i>

598
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:27,453
We can't. He's close.

599
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,253
We can't pull over here.
It's not safe.

600
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,351
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>just pull the car over,</i>

601
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,554
or I'll have my men
help you do it?

602
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,393
We cannot pull over here!

603
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:36,625
You don't understand!

604
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:40,701
<i>Suspects are still</i>
<i>not stopping, sir.</i>

605
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:42,962
I don't give a rat's cock bag
how you do it!

606
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,201
<i>You will pull them over</i>
<i>and stop them right now!</i>
<i>Over!</i>

607
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:46,264
<i>Copy on that.</i>

608
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,343
What the...

609
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:49,877
Oh, my God!

610
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,009
Oh, shit!

611
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:56,745
- I'm gonna pull over!
- Okay! Okay! Okay!

612
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,878
Oh, fuck!

613
00:50:57,954 --> 00:50:59,649
<i>Lieutenant,</i>
<i>ground is firing on suspects.</i>

614
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,486
Hold her steady!

615
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:05,786
Okay, we're pulling over.

616
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:06,886
Please, just stop shooting!

617
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:09,932
<i>Air 2 to ground,</i>
<i>you got another vehicle</i>
<i>approaching fast from behind.</i>

618
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,059
<i>It's a late-model</i>
<i>black Trans Am.</i>

619
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:19,939
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

620
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,811
It's him, Jim.

621
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:24,005
Fuck!

622
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:29,209
<i>Somebody talk to me.</i>

623
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,880
<i>Have you pulled over</i>
<i>the suspects yet?</i>

624
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:39,887
<i>What the fuck</i>
<i>is going on down there?</i>

625
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,170
Fuck!

626
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,645
Oh, my God!

<i>What's going on</i>
<i>down there?</i>

628
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,458
Fuck!

Son of a bitch!

630
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,111
You gotta be
five-finger fucking me!

631
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,912
Keep going!

632
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,180
Grace, I can't go
any faster!

633
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:40,245
Just drive. Go.

634
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,312
I can't go
any fuckin' faster!

635
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,417
Oh, fuck.

636
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:04,039
Where's he going?

637
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:22,663
Come on. We got to go.

638
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,063
He might come back.

639
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,294
Where?

640
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,505
Jim.

641
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,642
Get your gun. Let's go.

642
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,140
Okay.

643
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,849
All right.
We're good.

644
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,867
Try to call home.

645
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:01,957
What's wrong?

646
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,490
It goes right to
the front desk.

647
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:06,853
Are you serious?

648
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,035
I should go find a payphone.

649
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,475
Call our folks,
see if we can get some help.

650
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,204
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

00:56:58,615 --> 00:56:59,604
Okay.

00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:10,990
Hey.

653
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,690
I'm sorry

I'm gonna get you down.

- It really hurts!
- I know. Just hold still.
Just hold still.

677
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:47,933
- Please stop him. Please!
- Wait, wait, wait.

678
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:54,966
No!

679
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,137
Stop it!
You're killing him!

680
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,241
Turn it off!

681
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:04,777
No.

682
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,583
Turn the truck off!

683
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:08,985
These clutches
are tricky things.

684
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:10,686
Touchy, you know.

685
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:16,996
One little slip, and...

686
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:18,793
I will shoot you.

687
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,901
You shoot me,
my foot comes off the clutch.

688
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:23,970
Now, get in.

689
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:26,071
- Get in!
- Okay.

690
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:34,374
Close the door.

691
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,119
Turn it off.

692
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:45,092
Stop! Stop the truck!

693
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:48,196
Turn it off!

694
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:53,290
I can't.

695
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,532
Yes, you can.
Just turn it off.

696
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:59,839
I can't. I can't.

697
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:04,836
You're sick.

698
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:08,443
What do you want?

699
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,689
Point it in my face.

700
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:23,388
Right here.

701
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:28,264
Do it.

702
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:34,903
It's your chance, Grace,

703
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,137
your chance to kill a man

704
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:38,112
who's gonna kill
your whiny fuckin' boyfriend.

705
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:41,344
No! Don't you say that!
Don't say that to me!

706
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:45,251
I want to die.

707
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:49,818
Now pull the fuckin' trigger.

708
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,126
State police!

709
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:04,898
Put the gun down!

710
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:08,576
This is the police!
Drop the gun now!

711
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:10,168
Don't listen to them.

712
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:17,616
No. Stop. Please.

713
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:18,779
Put the gun down!

714
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,948
Go ahead. You can do it!

715
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,218
Put it down!
Put the gun down!

716
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,425
Put the gun down now!

717
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:28,088
Put that gun down,
God damn it!

718
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,495
I can't...

719
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:35,734
Please.

720
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:37,705
Please, don't tease him.
Please.

721
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,774
Please,
just stop hurting him.

722
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:41,434
Please!

723
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:46,179
This is the police!
Put the gun down now!

724
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:50,644
No.

725
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You useless waste!
No! No!

726
01:04:57,693 --> 01:04:59,217
No!

727
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:03,754
No!

728
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,360
Get your hands off of me!

729
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,268
<i>Get up here!</i>
<i>Get up here!</i>

730
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,569
<i>Let's go, man. This way!</i>

731
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,381
<i>I want to die.</i>

732
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:31,693
- <i>No!</i>
- Grace?

733
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:44,271
Grace, do you know
who this man is?

734
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,844
That's the real John Ryder.

735
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,879
He's been missing
since Tuesday.

736
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,680
Then who...

737
01:05:58,754 --> 01:05:59,880
We don't know yet.

738
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,150
Now, we've run
his fingerprints
and mug shots

739
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:03,282
through every database
we've got,

740
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,417
and we've come up
with nothing.

741
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,358
This guy's a ghost.

742
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:09,431
<i>So, I need your help</i>
<i>here, Grace.</i>

743
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:12,296
<i>Is there anything</i>
<i>he told you about himself?</i>

744
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:14,028
<i>No.</i>

745
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,063
<i>Anything at all?</i>

746
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,233
No.

747
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:29,675
Open cell F!

748
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:36,915
Ryder, I need you to stand up
and put your hands
behind your back.

749
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:40,360
I need you to stand up,
put your hands
behind your back.

750
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:02,644
So, where are you from?

751
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:05,015
All over.

752
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:08,520
Is that so?

753
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,155
You're a sick fuck,
aren't ya?

754
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,554
The way you tortured
that young man.

755
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:18,990
I know
you enjoyed yourself.

756
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:22,764
I just can't figure out
why you did it.

757
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,600
You knew
you'd get caught.

758
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:26,265
Why'd you do it?

759
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,272
Why not?

760
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:34,981
How many others
have you killed?

761
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,054
Hard to say.

762
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:47,524
You see,
here in the great state
of New Mexico,

763
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:49,893
we do have
the death penalty.

764
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,461
You don't seem
too worried.

765
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:58,972
Should I be?

766
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:06,446
You comfy down there, John?

767
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:09,009
Are those cuffs
a little tight?

768
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:11,412
Yeah, a little tight.

769
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:14,217
Yeah, you see,
those are the new ones.

770
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:20,426
They stretch out after
you wear them for a while.
Let me see.

771
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:25,690
Look at me.

772
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,633
You have yourself
a nice trip.

773
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:34,935
We'll chat again real soon.

774
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:38,809
Maybe next time,
you'll be better company.

775
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:14,071
Thanks.

776
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,249
Where are we going?

777
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,818
I'm taking you to Albuquerque
for trauma support.

778
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:25,425
I can release you
to your parents there.

779
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:53,486
Step up.

780
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:44,599
03 X-ray,
we're about 20 minutes out.

781
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:46,436
<i>Copy that, 03 X-ray.</i>

782
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:50,906
I get home,
I look at my paycheck.

783
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:51,969
It's so skinny.

784
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,238
I decide to take
another job.

785
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:55,907
So now
I'm delivering pizza.

786
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,919
What are you
getting your daughter
for her birthday?

787
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:08,155
She's just turned five.

788
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,754
She wants to take me...
Go to the mall,

789
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:11,766
get one of those big
customized teddy bears.

790
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:13,358
A customized teddy bear?
Come on.

791
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:14,766
Yeah.

792
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:17,635
It's just another way
they can charge...

793
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:40,755
Look, Grace...

794
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:43,624
I wish I could have
stopped this

795
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:46,566
before it got
all out of control.

796
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:52,338
I know there's
nothing that I can say
that'll bring Jim back,

797
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:55,934
but I am sorry.

798
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:58,545
I truly am.

799
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:03,815
Get your own little pants,
your own little jacket.

800
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:05,911
Make your own
little teddy bear.

801
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,170
For real, you spent
100 bucks on a teddy bear?

802
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,730
Yeah, I know.
It was hurting me.

803
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,365
Yeah, it's 100 bucks...

804
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,714
You know,
this week's check,
it's gone.

805
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Stop moving.
What the fuck?

806
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:06,837
It's cool...

807
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:10,844
Oh, shit!

808
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:17,718
Son of a bitch!

809
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:38,406
My leg's stuck.

810
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,777
03 X-ray.

811
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:48,345
I need a Code 3 backup
on Highway 19.

812
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:50,148
<i>10-4, 03 X-ray.</i>

813
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:54,622
Grace, I want you
to run up over that hill
and wait there for help.

814
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:57,731
I'm done running.

815
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,132
Grace! Grace!

816
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:03,101
That's not the answer.

817
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:05,200
You don't know
what you're doing.

818
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,605
Yes, I do.

819
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:15,476
Grace!

820
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:25,522
Grace, be careful!

821
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

822
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,233
Backup, now!
Let's go!

823
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:51,043
03 X-ray. Where the hell
is my goddamn backup?

824
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,454
You better hurry.

825
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:55,713
Grace!

826
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:20,734
Go fuck yourself!

827
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:25,837
No!

828
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,173
Feels good, doesn't it?

829
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,517
I don't feel a thing.
