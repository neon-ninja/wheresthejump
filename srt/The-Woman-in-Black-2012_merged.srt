1
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:42,208
My babies!

2
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:08,202
Arthur...

3
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:24,607
Daddy!

4
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:26,808
Coming.

5
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:40,403
Do you like it, daddy?

6
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:43,204
Very much.

7
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:47,605
You didn’t look at it properly.
- Of course I did.

8
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:51,806
That's me, that's nanny,

9
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:55,207
that's mommy, that's you.

10
00:03:57,008 --> 00:04:01,008
Why do I look so sad?
- That's what your face looks like.

11
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,709
Oh it is, is it?

12
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,110
I wish you didn’t have
to go away from me.

13
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,200
Me too. But we’ll have the whole
weekend in the countryside.

14
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:16,201
See... tomorrow,
then thursday,

15
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:21,202
then we’re back together.
Not long at all.

16
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:28,605
You look just like your mother.

17
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:31,405
Have you got the train tickets?
- Yes, we've got the train tickets.

18
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:34,106
And you know the times?
- Yes, we know the times.

19
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:37,306
Okay, I've got to go.
I don't wanna be late.

20
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:41,007
Go. We'll be fine. We'll
see you friday. - See you.

21
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:48,301
I take it Tomes has briefed you
on Mrs Alice Drablow

22
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:53,102
of Eel Marsh House.
Died. Last month.

23
00:04:53,903 --> 00:04:57,103
Years since I went there, of course.

24
00:04:57,304 --> 00:05:01,204
The old widow didn't
greatly care for visitors.

25
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:04,406
No children?

26
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:08,207
A boy. Died young.

27
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,908
Many years ago. I'll let you have
the details to read on your journey.

28
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:17,109
But, principally, you're going to go
through Mrs Drablow's documents.

29
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,400
Her private papers,
whatever they may be,

30
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:23,501
wherever they may be
and to bring them back,

31
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:26,501
in preparation for a sale.
- Very good.

32
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:29,903
I know you've had it rough, Kipps.

33
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:33,504
And I'm sympathetic
to your situation.

34
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:38,505
But we can't carry passengers.

35
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,406
We are a law firm, not a charity.

36
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:46,607
This is your last chance.

37
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:36,701
Mommy!

38
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:16,405
Mr Kipps...

39
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:21,707
It's a boy.

40
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:35,609
I'm very sorry, Mr Kipps.

41
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,401
Have we passed
Crythin Gifford yet?

42
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:02,002
Next stop.

43
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:10,202
So, you're from London?
- I am.

44
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:13,603
Trying to sell Eel Marsh House?

45
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:18,503
You won't find a local buyer.

46
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:24,705
Are you staying at
the Gifford Arms? - Yes.

47
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:28,106
It's a bit of a walk from
the station. I can give you a lift.

48
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,307
It's on my way home.
- Thank you.

49
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:35,408
- Samuel Daily.
- Arthur Kipps.

50
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:39,007
It's a beautiful car, Mr Daily.

51
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:42,108
First one in the county.
Still scares the locals.

52
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,608
Here we are.

53
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:47,009
Thank you.

54
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,510
Very good to talk
to you, Mr Daily.

55
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:54,401
Mr Kipps!

56
00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:58,102
Would you like to have supper with
my wife and me tomorrow evening?

57
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:01,203
We don't get to see
many new faces here.

58
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:05,202
That'd be lovely. Thank you.
- 'Night.

59
00:09:10,404 --> 00:09:12,804
Good evening.

60
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:15,905
I'm Mr Kipps. I've got
a room booked until sunday.

61
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,605
No, I don't find any booking.

62
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:23,506
- My offices telegraphed ahead.
- Well, we're packed to the rafters.

63
00:09:25,408 --> 00:09:27,408
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

64
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:30,709
I was just telling Mr Kipps
that we don't have any room.

65
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,610
Oh, we can't have him out
in this weather, can we?

66
00:09:34,811 --> 00:09:38,411
Not in the rain.
We must have something.

67
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:41,412
Just for tonight.
- We don't.

68
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:45,513
Unless you want to
put him in the attic.

69
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Fine.

70
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:54,602
It's this way.

71
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:06,901
Actually I was hoping
to stay til the weekend.

72
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,800
My son and his nanny are
travelling up to join me.

73
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,301
Oh, I see.

74
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:18,001
If a holiday’s what you’re after,
you’d be better off further inland.

75
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,802
It gets awfully cold here
with the sea mists.

76
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:24,003
<i>Sea mists.
Sea mists.</i>

77
00:10:25,404 --> 00:10:27,904
It's this way.

78
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:39,506
How old is your son?
- He's four.

79
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:42,307
Lovely age.

80
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:52,309
Thank you.

81
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:05,101
Good night.

82
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,400
In!

83
00:12:26,602 --> 00:12:28,802
Hello?

84
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,200
Mrs Jerome?

85
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:48,001
- Mr Kipps?
- Yes.

86
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:51,802
My husband went to meet
you at the Gifford Arms.

87
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:56,903
This is Mr Kipps.

88
00:12:57,504 --> 00:13:01,004
I made it clear to your firm there was
no need for you to make the journey.

89
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:03,905
We could have sent all the
relevant documents to London.

90
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:07,205
In any event, you’ll find
all the legal papers in here.

91
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:10,206
Mr Fisher tells me
you're leaving today.

92
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:13,506
Not until I've taken care of all
the Mrs Drablow's paperwork.

93
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:15,407
It's all in there, as I said.

94
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:18,408
No, at the house. I'm told
there's quite a substantial amount.

95
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:21,908
I don't expect to be finished
until friday at least.

96
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:26,209
That's not possible.

97
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,510
Gifford Arms is fully
booked for the week.

98
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I shall have to contact my office.
Do you have a telephone?

99
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:38,501
Not even Mr Daily has a telephone, sir.
You'll not find one in Crythin Gifford.

100
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:40,902
Fine, I'll send a telegram.

101
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:43,603
Post office is closed
on a Wednesday morning.

102
00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:45,704
The London train leaves
in half an hour.

103
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:48,604
My colleague Keckwick is waiting
outside with your luggage.

104
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:51,705
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Kipps.

105
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,608
Mr Keckwick,
change of plans.

106
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,509
I'm not catching the train.
You'll take me to Eel Marsh House.

107
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,610
Jerome paid me to
take you to the station.

108
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,801
Make it six and I'll think
about it. - Six shillings?

109
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:26,502
You’ll not find anyone else
willing to take you there.

110
00:15:41,202 --> 00:15:43,802
There you are.

111
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:52,503
Can you pick me up at three?

112
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:55,304
I can't. I need to get back to
mainland before the tide comes in,

113
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:57,405
otherwise I'll be stuck
here for the day.

114
00:15:57,506 --> 00:16:00,106
It'll be out again by five.
I'll come back for you then.

115
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:02,707
Five then.

116
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

117
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:02,809
Come on then.

118
00:23:47,407 --> 00:23:49,607
Hello?

119
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

120
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:23,403
Who's there?

121
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

122
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:44,007
Keckwick!

123
00:24:48,408 --> 00:24:50,408
Mommy!

124
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:18,801
Constable, I'm telling you.
I've heard an accident.

125
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,601
No one has used Nine Lives
Causeway for years, sir.

126
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:27,202
Not since the little Drablow boy
was drowned in the marshes.

127
00:25:27,303 --> 00:25:29,903
And Eel Marsh House - it’s empty.

128
00:25:30,004 --> 00:25:33,004
It's not, though.
I saw a woman there.

129
00:25:33,405 --> 00:25:36,605
I can assure you no one
goes there. - Collins!

130
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,503
Excuse me one moment, sir.

131
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:55,005
Sir, my sister needs help.

132
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:58,406
What's the matter?
What's your name, darling?

133
00:25:58,507 --> 00:26:01,507
- Her name is Victoria Hardy.
- Did something bad happen?

134
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
She drank some lye.
Our mom was out.
Lye? Oh god... Constable!
Is she going to die?
- Constable!
It's going to be alright,
darling. Just let me...

135
00:26:18,807 --> 00:26:21,007
Constable!

136
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,800
My baby!

137
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:37,403
Hello? Mrs Fisher?

138
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:44,805
<i>My baby!</i>

139
00:28:13,202 --> 00:28:16,802
It's getting late.
You'll miss your London train.

140
00:28:18,002 --> 00:28:20,602
I can't leave yet.

141
00:28:20,803 --> 00:28:23,803
Please don't go back
to Eel Marsh House.

142
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:25,803
Why?

143
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,704
Mr Kipps. You said you have a son.

144
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:31,905
Yes.

145
00:28:32,206 --> 00:28:36,006
Go home to him. Cherish him.

146
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:39,307
Love him.

147
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,700
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

148
00:28:55,005 --> 00:28:57,805
Oh, Mr Kipps.

149
00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:01,006
Glad you could make it.
- My pleasure.

150
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:04,307
I'm just bidding my son
Nicholas goodbye.

151
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:08,208
- My condolences, Mr Daily.
- It was a long while ago.

152
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:11,909
There's a place ready in there
for my wife and me.

153
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,110
So we can all be together.

154
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:21,001
I heard about the girl
in the village. Terrible.

155
00:29:21,902 --> 00:29:25,102
Are you alright?
- Yes.

156
00:29:26,302 --> 00:29:28,702
My wife doesn't know,

157
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:32,303
and I'd be grateful if you
could avoid the subject.

158
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:36,704
Indeed, the subject of children
altogether, if at all possible.

159
00:29:38,406 --> 00:29:42,406
He would've been about your
age now. - Thank you, Archer.

160
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:47,608
Ah, there you are, dear.

161
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:50,209
Mr Kipps, I've been so looking
forward to meeting you.

162
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:53,309
The pleasure is all mine.
I'm sorry, I must look a bit of a mess.

163
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,900
I found myself without a room.

164
00:29:56,001 --> 00:29:58,499
Oh, then you must stay with us.
Mustn't he, Samuel?

165
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,200
Indeed he must, dear.
Now, lets eat.

166
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,801
Arthur...
- Thank you.

167
00:30:05,101 --> 00:30:08,501
The twins won't be dining with
us tonight, Archer. - Samuel!

168
00:30:08,702 --> 00:30:12,302
I'm sure Mr Kipps won't mind.
- Not at all.

169
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,603
Emily!

170
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:18,404
Thank you.

171
00:30:19,004 --> 00:30:22,004
Now, say hello to Mr Kipps.

172
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:24,205
Hello.

173
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,006
Thank you, Archer.

174
00:30:32,008 --> 00:30:34,208
There.

175
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:39,409
Are you married, Mr Kipps?
Stop the gobble, that's rude.

176
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,900
Any children?
- A son.

177
00:30:43,101 --> 00:30:46,901
Ah, that's lovely. You don't
want to end up like us.

178
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:51,602
Wealthiest folk in the county,
and no one to leave it to.

179
00:30:53,203 --> 00:30:56,203
Did he tell you about Nicholas?
- Elizabeth!

180
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:58,704
That's him.

181
00:30:59,005 --> 00:31:02,605
I painted that myself.
I love to paint and sketch.

182
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:05,106
It's lovely.

183
00:31:05,307 --> 00:31:08,307
Nicholas loved to sketch too.

184
00:31:13,008 --> 00:31:16,208
- He still does.
- Elizabeth, please...

185
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:20,401
He wants to draw you a picture.

186
00:31:20,602 --> 00:31:22,802
Elizabeth...

187
00:31:23,603 --> 00:31:26,103
Elizabeth, no!

188
00:31:26,603 --> 00:31:28,803
Elizabeth!

189
00:31:31,004 --> 00:31:34,204
Archer! The medication!
- No! No!

190
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:37,605
Archer! Medication!

191
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:06,104
I thought some company
would do her good.

192
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:08,605
Please, think nothing of it.

193
00:32:08,706 --> 00:32:12,906
She's convinced it's our son,
speaking through her.

194
00:32:14,804 --> 00:32:18,604
You don't believe in this
spiritualism stuff, do you?

195
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:22,005
Seances and contacting the dead.

196
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:24,806
I didn't.

197
00:32:25,807 --> 00:32:29,007
But since my wife
passed away... I don't know.

198
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,200
Ah, forgive me. I didn't...

199
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:38,201
Sometimes I feel
she's still with me.

200
00:32:39,602 --> 00:32:42,402
Sometimes I just...

201
00:32:43,203 --> 00:32:46,303
...feel she's there. In the room.

202
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:50,003
Trying to reach me.

203
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:53,604
You must be careful, Arthur.
These charlatans, they prey

204
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:57,705
on those most in need.
They're more harm than good.

205
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:02,402
I think the worst
they do is disappoint.

206
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:06,503
I have to keep looking.

207
00:33:07,605 --> 00:33:11,405
It's not natural to lose
someone so young.

208
00:33:13,307 --> 00:33:17,307
But if open the door to superstition,
where does that lead?

209
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:21,008
It's just chasing shadows, Arthur.

210
00:33:52,403 --> 00:33:55,403
Come on. Lay down.

211
00:34:43,803 --> 00:34:47,203
I'll lose my job if I don't get
this paperwork done.

212
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:50,804
If Jerome gives me some help,
I can go and meet my boy.

213
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:54,305
I doubt if Jerome will be
of much help to you.

214
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:14,704
Mr Jerome!

215
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:03,608
Go away!

216
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:07,710
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- You killed Victoria Hardy!

217
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,200
Get away from me! Go!

218
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:14,201
Go!

219
00:36:16,803 --> 00:36:20,303
- What the hell is going on?
- Complete nonsense.

220
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:23,404
Lets take you to the house.

221
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:37,602
You should've left. You should've
gone when we told you to. - John!

222
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:40,503
His little girl is dead.

223
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:43,104
He saw her!

224
00:36:43,305 --> 00:36:45,705
Did you see her?

225
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:49,806
For god sake! Take him home.
This isn't helping him.

226
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:53,107
All your superstitious rubbish.

227
00:36:53,808 --> 00:36:57,208
You think it's superstitious
rubbish that took your boy?

228
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:08,801
Alright.

229
00:37:09,002 --> 00:37:11,802
I'll take him to the station.

230
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

231
00:37:33,007 --> 00:37:37,007
Pay no attention to them, Arthur.
They're still living in the dark ages.

232
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:41,008
But I did see someone at the house.
I wasn't alone.

233
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:45,409
Trust me, Arthur, it's just a strange
old place cut out from the world.

234
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:49,401
Sooner the house is
sorted out and sold,

235
00:37:49,502 --> 00:37:52,102
sooner people can move on.

236
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:55,202
Here. This will keep you going.

237
00:37:56,604 --> 00:37:59,804
The late tide is due at eleven.
I'll come back for you then.

238
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:03,305
It's fine. I'd rather just
work through the night.

239
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:07,905
Well, take the dog.
Come on, girl!

240
00:38:09,906 --> 00:38:12,406
Just for company.

241
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:15,507
Don't go chasing shadows, Arthur.

242
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

243
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

244
00:46:10,307 --> 00:46:12,707
<i>Dear Alice.</i>

245
00:46:12,908 --> 00:46:16,308
<i>You leave me no option
but to give up my son.</i>

246
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,500
<i>If I am deemed unfit to raise
my child, what can I do?</i>

247
00:46:21,002 --> 00:46:24,602
<i>You and Charles can take him
from me, but he is mine.</i>

248
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:28,003
<i>Mine. He can never be yours.</i>

249
00:46:28,204 --> 00:46:30,404
<i>Jennet.</i>

250
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>Dear Alice, I find it
hard to express</i>
<i>the depth of betrayal
from you, my own sister.</i>
<i>At your refusal
to let me visit my son.</i>

251
00:47:07,305 --> 00:47:10,305
<i>Or even give him my birthday
cards. I begin to believe</i>

252
00:47:10,405 --> 00:47:14,005
<i>you're not doing this for the good
of the boy, but to cause me pain.</i>

253
00:47:14,106 --> 00:47:18,106
<i>He's mine. If you won't let me
see him, I will find the way.</i>

254
00:47:46,602 --> 00:47:49,602
<i>His blood is on your hands.</i>

255
00:47:49,803 --> 00:47:53,403
<i>You didn't try to save him.
You just saved yourself.</i>

256
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:56,404
<i>You didn't even give
him a proper burial.</i>

257
00:47:56,504 --> 00:47:59,504
<i>You just left him there in the mud.</i>

258
00:47:59,705 --> 00:48:03,705
<i>My world is destroyed.
My life is over.</i>

259
00:48:04,405 --> 00:48:07,405
<i>Rot in hell.</i>

260
00:56:58,402 --> 00:57:01,002
Who's there?

261
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

262
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

263
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You don't believe me, do you?
I believe even the most rational
mind can play tricks in the dark.

264
01:02:13,003 --> 01:02:15,803
I saw them, Sam.

265
01:02:16,404 --> 01:02:19,204
I saw her and her boy.

266
01:02:20,006 --> 01:02:24,206
The boy was lost to the marsh.
His body was never recovered.

267
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,009
I saw them.

268
01:02:48,403 --> 01:02:50,603
Lucy!

269
01:02:52,204 --> 01:02:54,204
Lucy!

270
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:56,805
Arthur!

271
01:02:57,307 --> 01:02:59,807
- Arthur!
- No!

272
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

273
01:03:26,203 --> 01:03:29,603
Stay there! I'm gonna
come and get you.

274
01:03:39,405 --> 01:03:41,005
No!

275
01:05:23,407 --> 01:05:25,607
Arthur?

276
01:05:27,707 --> 01:05:29,707
Here.

277
01:05:41,702 --> 01:05:46,102
I remember when the Jeromes
lost their first child.

278
01:05:48,604 --> 01:05:51,604
They decided to have another.

279
01:05:52,005 --> 01:05:54,005
Lucy.

280
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:57,905
They locked her up
to protect her.

281
01:05:59,606 --> 01:06:03,606
Not that you can ever replace...
- She was there, Sam.

282
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,200
You're tired. Get some rest.

283
01:07:03,203 --> 01:07:06,403
What happened to him, Mrs Daily?

284
01:07:07,604 --> 01:07:10,404
He was playing at the beach
with his friends.

285
01:07:10,605 --> 01:07:14,205
They said the tide must've
caught them off guard.

286
01:07:21,007 --> 01:07:24,007
You've seen her, haven't you?

287
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,400
She was there
this morning in the fire.

288
01:07:28,801 --> 01:07:31,401
She's always there.

289
01:07:32,702 --> 01:07:35,602
You mustn't blame yourself.

290
01:07:36,001 --> 01:07:39,001
- Blame myself for what?
- For not listening to the others.

291
01:07:39,102 --> 01:07:41,902
For not staying away
from the house.

292
01:07:42,003 --> 01:07:44,603
I don't understand.

293
01:07:46,202 --> 01:07:49,002
Whenever she's been seen,

294
01:07:49,403 --> 01:07:52,803
on the Causeway, on the marsh,
in the grounds of the house,

295
01:07:53,004 --> 01:07:55,904
however briefly and whoever by,

296
01:07:56,004 --> 01:08:00,004
there has always been
one sure and certain result.

297
01:08:00,305 --> 01:08:02,105
Yes?

298
01:08:02,806 --> 01:08:06,306
In some violent or
dreadful circumstance,

299
01:08:06,505 --> 01:08:09,105
a child has died.

300
01:08:09,406 --> 01:08:12,806
So many children...
So many children.

301
01:08:13,407 --> 01:08:16,307
The Fishers' daughters and...

302
01:08:16,508 --> 01:08:19,808
Jerome's eldest, Keckwick's son...

303
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
my Nicholas...
- How?

304
01:08:24,401 --> 01:08:26,801
Mrs Daily?

305
01:08:27,802 --> 01:08:30,202
Mrs Daily?

306
01:08:31,503 --> 01:08:35,503
She makes us!
She makes us do it.

307
01:08:36,203 --> 01:08:40,403
She makes us...
she can't find him,

308
01:08:40,604 --> 01:08:43,404
so she takes us.

309
01:08:57,206 --> 01:08:59,606
She saw you.

310
01:08:59,807 --> 01:09:02,407
She saw you.

311
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,200
She's coming!
She's coming!

312
01:09:14,101 --> 01:09:16,101
Sam!

313
01:09:17,202 --> 01:09:20,002
Elizabeth! No!

314
01:09:20,503 --> 01:09:23,103
No, daddy! No!

315
01:09:28,203 --> 01:09:30,203
Elizabeth...

316
01:09:39,404 --> 01:09:41,504
Joseph!

317
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:47,805
If we can get the telegram off now,
it will catch them before they leave.

318
01:09:48,005 --> 01:09:51,005
How could you take me to Eel
Marsh if even a small part of you

319
01:09:51,106 --> 01:09:54,106
feared the stories were true?
- But I never believed.

320
01:09:54,207 --> 01:09:56,607
You didn't want to.
There's a difference.

321
01:09:56,708 --> 01:10:00,308
I'd no choice, Arthur. Either Nicholas
is in a better place, or he's lost.

322
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:03,300
Forgive me, Sam,
but my son is alive.

323
01:10:03,401 --> 01:10:06,001
He's on his way here.

324
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:14,003
The next village
is over an hour away.

325
01:10:14,504 --> 01:10:17,504
They'd left by then.

326
01:10:19,205 --> 01:10:22,105
What time is the tide back out?

327
01:10:22,206 --> 01:10:24,806
Five. Why?

328
01:10:25,607 --> 01:10:28,407
If we can reunite Jennet
Humfrye with her son,

329
01:10:28,508 --> 01:10:31,308
perhaps she’ll finally be at peace.

330
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,200
They never recovered
the child's body, Arthur.

331
01:10:34,301 --> 01:10:37,301
But you have something
they never had.

332
01:11:55,802 --> 01:11:58,002
Arthur?

333
01:12:12,406 --> 01:12:15,006
Sam, I feel it!

334
01:12:15,807 --> 01:12:18,807
It's just beneath my feet!

335
01:12:19,608 --> 01:12:23,008
Need the rope more taut.
- Be careful!

336
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:58,005
Arthur?

337
01:12:59,606 --> 01:13:02,206
Oh my god!

338
01:13:43,207 --> 01:13:45,807
Keep driving!

339
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,300
- Don't stop!
- The pedal's on the floor!

340
01:14:07,604 --> 01:14:11,804
The engine is overheating! I don't
think it can take any more weight!

341
01:14:12,106 --> 01:14:14,706
I found the boy!

342
01:14:29,002 --> 01:14:31,802
Can you go any further?

343
01:14:32,603 --> 01:14:35,203
Stop. There he is!

344
01:15:23,406 --> 01:15:26,406
Lets just put him
in the ground, Arthur.

345
01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:29,207
Lets get it over with.

346
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:31,401
Sam...

347
01:15:31,802 --> 01:15:34,802
There's something
I need to do first.

348
01:15:35,202 --> 01:15:37,602
They're lost.

349
01:15:40,003 --> 01:15:43,003
They need to find each other.

350
01:16:38,007 --> 01:16:40,807
Nearly time now.

351
01:18:00,608 --> 01:18:03,008
Come on.

352
01:18:25,605 --> 01:18:27,805
Nicholas?

353
01:18:57,204 --> 01:18:59,204
Daddy?

354
01:19:09,406 --> 01:19:11,606
Arthur!

355
01:20:35,904 --> 01:20:39,004
No! You're not my mother!

356
01:21:12,402 --> 01:21:14,402
Arthur!

357
01:21:20,004 --> 01:21:22,804
I think she's gone.

<i>I'll never forgive you
for letting my boy die.</i>

360
01:23:06,806 --> 01:23:09,606
<i>Never forgive.</i>

361
01:23:11,207 --> 01:23:13,507
<i>Never forgive.</i>

362
01:23:13,908 --> 01:23:16,208
<i>Never forgive.</i>

363
01:23:16,809 --> 01:23:19,109
<i>Never forgive!</i>

364
01:23:25,802 --> 01:23:29,002
One step, two steps. Good boy.

365
01:23:36,804 --> 01:23:39,304
- Joseph!
- Daddy!

366
01:23:47,405 --> 01:23:50,105
What do you say to daddy?

367
01:23:50,306 --> 01:23:52,906
- I love you, daddy.
- I love you too.

368
01:23:53,407 --> 01:23:56,907
Joseph, this is my friend Sam.
- Hello, Sam.

369
01:23:57,108 --> 01:23:59,908
Hello, Joseph.
It's very nice to meet you.

370
01:24:00,209 --> 01:24:02,409
Change of plans. We're not
staying here tonight.

371
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:04,310
We're going straight
back to London.

372
01:24:04,411 --> 01:24:07,411
Can you fetch us some tickets?
I'll explain on the way.

373
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:13,012
Are you sure you don't want
to stay with us tonight?

374
01:24:13,213 --> 01:24:16,713
- Yes. I just want to get him home.
- I understand.

375
01:24:17,214 --> 01:24:19,814
Three tickets back
to London, please.

376
01:24:20,615 --> 01:24:24,215
Will you and Elizabeth be alright?
- We will.

377
01:24:24,816 --> 01:24:28,016
You must come
to London and visit us.

378
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:12,004
Arthur!

379
01:25:51,402 --> 01:25:53,602
Sam?

380
01:26:09,007 --> 01:26:12,007
Daddy, who's that lady?

381
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,600
That's your mommy.
