1
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:51,405
What do you boys
think about going
turkey hunting this year?

2
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:56,627
-Think you ought to go...
-Mr. Willie, my momma

3
00:03:56,671 --> 00:04:00,240
wanted me to ask you
would you come
down to our house?

4
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:03,199
There's some
kind of wild man

5
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,809
down there in the woods
by the creek.

6
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:07,290
Now, boy,

7
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:09,161
I want you to go
back down there
and tell your momma

8
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:11,860
there ain't a thing
in the world
to be afraid of.

9
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:14,036
I'll come down there
tomorrow and check it out.

10
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,258
Go ahead.

11
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:21,739
Yes, sir.

12
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:25,482
Thank you, sir.

13
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:28,877
You know that's
the third time

14
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,879
that ol' lady's
sent that kid
up here to tell me

15
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:33,229
there's a big ol'
hairy monster
down in my field.

16
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,318
I guess I'll have to
get down there tomorrow
and see about it.

17
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,650
I was seven-years-old when I first heard him scream.

18
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:50,132
It scared me then,
and it scares me now.

19
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:44,246
This is Fouke, Arkansas.

20
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,857
I grew up here.

21
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:50,731
The population was about
350 when I was a boy.

22
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:52,689
It still is.

23
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,955
Fouke is way down
in the southwest corner

24
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:01,524
where Arkansas joins
Texas and Louisiana.

25
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:05,223
If you've ever driven from
Shreveport to Texarkana,

26
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:07,312
you'll pass
right through Fouke.

27
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:09,184
Even if you don't
remember seeing it.

28
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:13,362
Aside from homes,

29
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:15,886
Fouke has several stores,

30
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,627
a couple of gas stations,

31
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:19,803
a post office and school,

32
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:22,023
garage and motel,

33
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:25,069
and two cafes for
the menfolk to stop by

34
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:27,463
for coffee and conversation

35
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,553
on the fish they've caught,
or the duck, quail, squirrel,

36
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,990
or deer they've hunted.

37
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:36,603
Fishing and hunting
take up a lot of
almost everybody's time.

38
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:41,346
Maybe Smokey Crabtree,
who lives way back down

39
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,566
on the edge of the Bottoms
will tell about

40
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,787
a mink or beaver
he or his son Travis caught.

41
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,676
Smokey raises beef cattle
and traps part time

42
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,852
and works as
a pipeline welder

43
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:10,680
when the good jobs
come along.

44
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,601
Travis walks and paddles
for miles every morning,

45
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:21,561
running his trap lines
before school starts.

46
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,399
Most of the people
who live around Fouke

47
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:37,794
are farmers or ranchers.

48
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:40,014
This country
is rich and fertile

49
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:42,233
with plenty of
grass and water.

50
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:45,846
Our land is veined with
a great network of

51
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,892
branches, creeks,
river and lakes.

52
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:51,808
Fouke is a right pleasant
place to live...

53
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:56,030
Until the sun goes down.

54
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:18,008
That day in the store,

55
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:19,706
Willie Smith
didn't believe me
when I told him

56
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:22,578
about a wild, hairy
creature in the woods.

57
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,407
He believes me now.

58
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,544
And he ran on East,

59
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,068
jumped over the fence.

60
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,244
It just seemed like
he just, sort of,
pushed it down

61
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:37,898
with his left hand,
just stepped over.

62
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:40,770
It was wounded and was
holding that right chest.

63
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:42,685
It had that right hand
on his chest

64
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,382
all the time that
it was in sight.

65
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,907
Maybe if it hadn't been
hurt pretty badly,

66
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,171
why, it might have
ran on all four legs,
I don't know.

67
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:51,520
But it wasn't.

68
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:54,654
It was running on
two legs at all times.

69
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:57,395
That was about
all I saw of this thing.

70
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,008
Something came through
here last night

71
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:03,401
and killed my two
prized shoats.

72
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:04,707
Found one of them
lying right here

73
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,578
deep gashes,

74
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,798
cuts and his tongue
was hanging out.

75
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:10,713
Looked like something
had strangled him.

76
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:14,543
I keep them off down here
by the creek in this pen.

77
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:17,111
And whatever it was,
got in the pen,

78
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:20,331
lifted both them 200-pound
hogs over the fence.

79
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,204
I couldn't find
no place where they'd
been dragged under.

80
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:26,076
I couldn't find no tracks,
so I figured
whatever it was,

81
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,732
came and left
travelling up and down
that creek.

82
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:32,039
Not knowing what
had killed them hogs,

83
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:33,431
I just threw them away.

84
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,564
I carried them way off
out there in the bushes

85
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:38,001
so the smell wouldn't
get back up to the house.

86
00:11:39,176 --> 00:11:40,482
Next day,

87
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:41,788
I got up and
looked out there

88
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:43,398
and thought it
kind of funny

89
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:46,749
not seeing any buzzards
circling or anything.

90
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:49,404
So, came down here
and both hogs were gone.

91
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,583
That thing,
whatever it was,
must've come back,

92
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:57,934
and the grass wasn't
even disturbed,
where the hogs was.

93
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:01,764
What kind of thing
can pick up
200-pound hogs

94
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:03,287
and walk off with them.

95
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,993
I doubt if you
could find a lonelier,

96
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,995
spookier place
in this country

97
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:17,084
than down around Boggy Creek.

98
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:26,963
It twists and winds its way
across the Fouke countryside,

99
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,139
widening and narrowing,

100
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,576
sheltering within
its thickly wooded banks

101
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,970
a multitude of creatures

102
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:39,236
that run, fly, swim,
creep and crawl.

103
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,762
Eventually, Boggy
empties into Days Creek

104
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,025
and flows onward
into the Sulphur River.

105
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:47,941
Heavy rainfall half the year

106
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:50,334
causes our creeks
and rivers to flood

107
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:52,815
and spread over
wide sections

108
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:56,166
of densely thicketed
and forested bottomland.

109
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,432
In the Sulphur River Bottoms,

110
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:05,741
the water spreads out
for miles across
the bottomland.

111
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,223
A lot of which is
so densely thicketed

112
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:12,617
that only a few hunters
and trappers have the skill

113
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:17,100
to make their way
deep into this wild,
swampy country.

114
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:21,888
A lot of people believe

115
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:25,108
the creature prowls
back in here
most of the time.

116
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:27,197
But every now and then,

117
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:30,635
drawn to civilization
like a moth to flame,

118
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,334
he creeps out about dusk.

119
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,909
These nighttime visits
have set off waves of terror

120
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:46,434
around Fouke
for over 15 years.

121
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:49,002
What in the world
is this creature?

122
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:52,005
"Where did he come from,
and what does he eat?"

123
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:55,965
are questions I've heard
discussed a thousand times

124
00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:00,187
around winter fires
and on hot summer evenings.

125
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,407
When the creature,
whom the newspapers
quickly named

126
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:06,410
"The Fouke Monster,"
was first seen,

127
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,586
he didn't seem to make
any special effort

128
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,632
to hide from people.

129
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,808
At least, Fred Crabtree,

130
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,637
a farmer who hunted a lot,
had that opinion.

131
00:14:40,357 --> 00:14:43,186
He just didn't look like
anything I'd ever seen.

132
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,365
I thought at first,
it might be some
kind of a wild man.

133
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:51,847
I couldn't tell
under all that hair
just what it was.

134
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,850
I changed the shells
in my shotgun

135
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,853
from my squirrel shot
to my buck shot.

136
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,466
- More for my protection
than anything else.

137
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:05,556
If I'd have had my rifle,

138
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,037
I believe I could have
knocked him down easy.

139
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:10,387
But I doubt if I would have.

140
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:13,390
'Cause I kept thinking
there's just a chance

141
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:15,305
he might be a man.

142
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:16,741
And if I had shot that thing,

143
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:18,743
and it turned out to be a man,

144
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:21,181
I'd have had to live with that for the rest of my life.

145
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,881
Although he was
never sure,

146
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,622
Fred got the impression

147
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:30,625
the creature had been
washing his feet
in the icy water.

148
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,065
A few months later,

149
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:38,850
James Crabtree
was squirrel hunting.

150
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:40,591
Only a short distance
from the spot

151
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:44,291
where Fred Crabtree
had seen it.

152
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:47,207
I've spent
a lot of my life
in these woods,

153
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,427
and there was something
strange about that evening

154
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:53,865
that I couldn't put
my finger on it.

155
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:56,216
It was just a feeling I had.

156
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:58,870
There didn't seem
to be as many birds

157
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:01,047
and little small animals
out as usual.

158
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,267
In fact, they seemed
mighty scarce.

159
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,091
It stepped right out
in plain sight.

160
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:47,571
Right out there
in front of me.

161
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,660
And he was...
It was some kind of thing

162
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:52,402
that I've never
come across before.

163
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:55,057
Well, he stared at me
for a little while

164
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,798
and just slipped
out of sight.

165
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:00,410
I never saw him again.

166
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,978
Neither Fred Crabtree,
nor his uncle James

167
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,676
told anyone about
their experience for years.

168
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,504
They figured nobody
would believe them.

169
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,424
He always travels
the creeks.

170
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,950
That was one of
the first things
we figured out.

171
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:27,394
This little branch
feeds into Boggy Creek.

172
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:30,658
The Searcy family
lives here.

173
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:33,835
Mary Beth Searcy
is a teenage student.

174
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:35,793
Right now,
her older married sister

175
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:37,273
and her baby are visiting.

176
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,797
Her father's working
in another town,

177
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:43,018
and her younger brother
is spending the night
with a friend.

178
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,716
So, this evening,
just the two girls,

179
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,937
their mother and the baby
will be alone in this house.

180
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,721
They have no phone

181
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:53,855
and the nearest neighbor
is a mile or so
across the woods.

182
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:05,769
Mary Beth?

183
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:10,121
Mary Beth, would you
please hang something
over the window?

184
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:11,558
There's a draft on the baby.

185
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,344
Yeah. Okay.
Just a minute.

186
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:42,023
Come here, kitty.

187
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,938
Come here, kitty.
Come here.

188
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:46,070
Come, kitty.

189
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:33,596
Mary Beth,

190
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,250
would you please
hurry up!

191
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,121
This draft's gonna
give the baby a cold.

192
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:39,254
Okay! Okay!

193
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,915
Mary Beth, what's the
matter with you?

194
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,917
What happened?
Tell me. Answer me...

195
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:36,572
It was a long
night of terror.

196
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:39,009
In a few minutes,
Mary Beth was revived,

197
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:41,664
and the three women,
shaking in fear,

198
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:45,146
freezing at every sound
in the darkness,

199
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:49,019
waited out the long
hours of blackness.

200
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:52,066
The baby slept peacefully
through it all.

201
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:55,112
Next morning,
they would discover
their dead kitten

202
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,116
completely unmarked.

203
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,294
Apparently, she had simply
been scared to death.

204
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,300
The beauty of the Bottoms
under soft moonlight

205
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:12,913
is transformed into
dark and menacing danger.

206
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:16,046
And the shadows of the night
trigger your imagination

207
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,486
into being places,
where possibly,
the creature is lurking.

208
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:23,750
Because you know
he's out there somewhere.

209
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,806
If, like this
13-year-old boy,

210
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:22,765
you've grown up as
a woodsman and hunter,

211
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:26,465
you never miss
an opportunity to
get yourself a deer.

212
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:35,474
Yes, there's
no doubt about it,

213
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,171
the dogs are
hot on the trail

214
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:38,868
chasing the deer
in this direction.

215
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,460
Later, they found
two-inch saplings

216
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:35,681
broken down by the creature
in his pain and fury.

217
00:26:35,724 --> 00:26:38,161
They saw crushed underbrush
and blood stains,

218
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:39,598
which in the excitement,

219
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,991
no one thought to
gather a sample of.

220
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:45,212
But they did not
find the creature.

221
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:46,779
The terrifying stories

222
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:49,259
of face to face encounters
with the creature

223
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:51,958
triggered the Fouke
community into action.

224
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:55,265
A big hunt was organized

225
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:56,702
with some of
the best hunting dogs

226
00:26:56,745 --> 00:26:59,052
in Arkansas
and Texas involved.

227
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:01,924
They even brought in
some famous dogs
from Tennessee.

228
00:27:01,968 --> 00:27:03,839
I got to go along.

229
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:07,669
And I still vividly recall
how I was trembling
with excitement.

230
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:09,584
We'd heard that earlier,
some other dogs

231
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,542
had refused to
trail the creature,

232
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:13,544
cowering in fear
and running back

233
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:16,199
at the first whiff of his
sour pig-pen smell.

234
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:19,681
But we were confident
our dogs would
get the job done.

235
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:28,124
Hey, Earl, where did
that ol' boy go that
brought them dogs in here.

236
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,076
While several groups
hunted on foot,

237
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,557
others scouted designated
areas on horseback.

238
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:23,440
While we made our way
along the dirt road
he had been crossing,

239
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:25,878
the men on horseback
swept across the woodlands

240
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,314
along the creek areas.

241
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:26,590
About this time,
our dogs struck his trail
where he'd crossed the road.

242
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:29,419
- Go get him.
- Spot, go get him!

243
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:30,769
They found his trail.

244
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:33,249
Go get him! Atta boy!
Trail him now. Get him.

245
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:35,469
You've never seen
a more embarrassed

246
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:37,471
and angry group
of dog owners.

247
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:40,735
Neither one of these
famous hunting dogs

248
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,129
would trail the
creature's scent.

249
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:45,087
They whined,
tucked their tails,

250
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:47,829
and came running back
obviously scared.

251
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,789
I was sure disappointed.

252
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:19,295
Despite the failure
of the dogs to trail
the creature,

253
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:22,124
several groups of
hunters kept going
far into the night.

254
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:26,389
Later, we got word

255
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:28,391
that one hunting party
had got the creature

256
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:31,917
to scream angrily back
at a wounded rabbit call,

257
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,180
but moved deeper
into the forest

258
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:36,095
when they tried
to get closer.

259
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,914
Not too many of
the hunters were
interested in plunging

260
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,395
into thick woods
in pitch darkness

261
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:17,049
knowing he was out there.

262
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:24,926
Often I've tried to imagine
how the creature must feel.

263
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:29,061
Since his very appearance
and the sounds he makes
frightened us,

264
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:33,282
our immediate reaction
was to try to kill him.

265
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:35,981
I suppose if
a strange-looking creature

266
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:38,200
from another world
showed up,

267
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:39,810
he'd get the same reception.

268
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,335
Actually, at first,

269
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:45,077
the creature didn't
try to harm anybody,

270
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,428
but now, after being
hunted and hurt,

271
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:50,212
he suddenly disappeared.

272
00:31:50,256 --> 00:31:52,345
So, far as we know,

273
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:54,651
he wasn't seen again
for eight years.

274
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:57,959
Where did he go?

275
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:00,266
Well, we believe
he simply headed back

276
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,921
deeper and deeper
into the Bottoms,

277
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,010
beyond the reach of men.

278
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:07,534
Only the alligator and wolf,

279
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:09,710
crane and possum,

280
00:32:09,753 --> 00:32:12,582
and a thousand other
wild creatures

281
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:15,977
heard his occasional,
lonely cries

282
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:18,675

his watery domain.

of the Bottoms,

00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:29,746

Fouke boys would admit it,

but for a long time,

306
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:23,338
knowing the creature
might be around

307
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:26,994
had put a damper
on our pack trips
back into the wilderness.

308
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:29,997
But as time passed,
and stories and conversation

309
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,652
about the Fouke monster
died down,

310
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:34,958
teenage boys again
began to go off

311
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:37,700
on long camping trips
in the Bottoms.

312
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:39,659

outdoor kid that
would have gone anyway,

even knowing the creature
was around.

00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:46,492
There's nothing
Travis likes better

00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:48,320

00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:39,317
He's been living alone
in these Bottoms
for the past 20 years.

349
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:04,037
Hey, Herb!

350
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:14,177
Well, Travis.

351
00:39:22,142 --> 00:39:25,450
Travis always enjoys
these visits with Herb,

352
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:29,236
and never fails
to bring him tobacco
and other supplies.

353
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,369
Herb can spin yarns
for hours

354
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:32,979
about his experiences

355
00:39:33,022 --> 00:39:35,808
with the wild creatures
of the Bottomland.

356
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:37,766
Herb tells Travis
to be on the look out

357
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,074
for a big ol' wild boar
with double curled tusks

358
00:39:41,117 --> 00:39:42,902
he spotted a day
or two earlier.

359
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:45,470
Herb limps because
he once accidentally shot

360
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:48,168
part of his foot away
in a boating accident.

361
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:49,735
Although he was all alone,

362
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:51,911
he made it out of
the Bottoms to a doctor.

363
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:03,096
I've been living down here
by myself for a long time.

364
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:06,447
About 14-miles by boat

365
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:09,581
from my place
to the nearest road,

366
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:11,931
then it's a pretty good
walk to town.

367
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:15,282
Them Crabtree boys,

368
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:17,284
especially that Travis,

369
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:18,981
always drop by
to see me

370
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:20,505
when they come
hunting and fishing.

371
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:24,378
They always brung me
tobacco and sugar

372
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,162
and stuff like that.

373
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:30,166
Even a bottle of wine
every once in a while.

374
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,735
Did you notice
my bottle tree
on the way in?

375
00:40:33,779 --> 00:40:39,045
I use them bottles
as hooks on my trout lines.

376
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:43,179
I catch some mighty
big catfish and buffalo
on them lines.

377
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:49,359
And an old crane
flies over every day.

378
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:51,579
Looks at my place.

379
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:54,887
I don't know
what he's looking for.

380
00:40:56,932 --> 00:41:00,762
Once you get to know
these Bottoms,

381
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:02,982
you never lack
for something to do.

382
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:08,335
People always ask me
why I stay down here.

383
00:41:08,378 --> 00:41:12,165
I tell them I stay 'cause
I like it better here

384
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,820
than I would anywhere else.

385
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:18,301
Looks like they could
figure that out
for themselves.

386
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:21,174
And another thing,

387
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:25,221
people always ask me

388
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:27,659
have I seen
the Fouke monster.

389
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,488
Let me tell you something,

390
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:33,055
there ain't no such thing.

391
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:34,970
I've been living here
in these Bottoms

392
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:38,496
for better than 20 years.

393
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:41,977
I ain't never seen
nor heard no monster.

394
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,724
What was that?

395
00:41:49,768 --> 00:41:51,857
I don't know,
but let's get out of here.

396
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:18,318
The creature was back.

397
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:20,712
Once again,
the lure of civilization

398
00:42:20,755 --> 00:42:22,278
had brought him
out of the wilderness.

399
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:54,310
Soon, newspaper
headlines would herald,

400
00:42:54,354 --> 00:42:56,704
"The Return of
the Fouke Monster."

401
00:42:56,748 --> 00:42:59,402
And people would
get together around
Fouke to relate

402
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:02,754
the latest rumors
on the creature.

403
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:04,930
Every dead animal
found in the forest

404
00:43:04,973 --> 00:43:06,148
was blamed upon him.

405
00:43:07,149 --> 00:43:09,325
This dog and others found dead,

406
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:11,458
might well be his victims.

407
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:13,721
Excitement in the community
reached a new peak

408
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:15,941
when a farmer
named O.H. Kennedy

409
00:43:15,984 --> 00:43:18,683
discovered these strange
three-toed footsteps

410
00:43:18,726 --> 00:43:20,815
in Willie Smith's bean field.

411
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:23,644
Radio, newspaper
and television coverage

412
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:26,516
resulted in
nation-wide publicity.

413
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,389
...must not be over
four inches wide.

414
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:30,912
Mr. Kennedy,

415
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:34,046
you say you found
these tracks late Sunday.

416
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:36,352
Now, was that
late yesterday afternoon?

417
00:43:36,396 --> 00:43:38,877
Yes, sir.
Just about sundown.

418
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,314
My wife and I went out
for a ride,

419
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:43,533
she's been feeling
poorly lately.

420
00:43:43,577 --> 00:43:46,101
And we decided to stop by
the bean field

421
00:43:46,145 --> 00:43:48,974
to see if the ground
was too wet to plow.

422
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:50,976
We called Willie Smith
right away.

423
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:53,195
Mr. Kennedy,
do you think

424
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:55,589
this creature could
be a sasquatch?

425
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,461
A... A sasquatch?

426
00:43:58,505 --> 00:44:00,899
I don't believe I know
what that is, sir.

427
00:44:00,942 --> 00:44:02,683
Well, the sasquatch was

428
00:44:02,727 --> 00:44:05,033
the Indians' word
for a legendary giant tribe

429
00:44:05,077 --> 00:44:06,861
of very shy people.

430
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:09,037
They live mostly in the woods

431
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:10,778
up in the Pacific Northwest.

432
00:44:10,822 --> 00:44:13,868
Well,
I didn't see anybody.

433
00:44:13,912 --> 00:44:15,740
All I've seen, sir,
is these tracks.

434
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:17,611
Well, now,
doesn't the sasquatch

435
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,613
have a normal five toes?

436
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,398
This thing here
has only three toes.

437
00:44:22,442 --> 00:44:25,010
Yes, and the adult
sasquatch footprint
is bigger, too.

438
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:27,055
It's 18 inches long
on the average.

439
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,753
Could these be
gorilla tracks?

440
00:44:28,796 --> 00:44:30,624
No, I don't think
it's a gorilla.

441
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,495
A gorilla has five toes,

442
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:35,629
and very seldom moves upright
on two legs for very long.

443
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,631
This thing, it had to
drop down on all fours

444
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,806
to travel this far.

445
00:44:40,068 --> 00:44:42,418
What about
an orangutan?

446
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:44,986
This is the same thing
people around here

447
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,946
reported seeing
over the past few years.

448
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,861
He's reddish-brown,

449
00:44:49,904 --> 00:44:52,515
that's the same color
as an orangutan.

450
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:55,649
Well, I don't think
this could be orangutan.

451
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,303
The number of the toes
are wrong.

452
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,610
Now, excuse me,
Mr. Kennedy,

453
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:03,657
you spend a lot of time
working in this field, right?

454
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,354
Did you ever see
tracks like this

455
00:45:05,398 --> 00:45:06,965
when you were here before?

456
00:45:07,008 --> 00:45:10,055
No, sir.
Can't say that I have.

457
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:13,406
There's a lot of fresh animal
tracks around this field
all the time.

458
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:15,321
Deer, wolf, bobcat,

459
00:45:15,364 --> 00:45:17,758
and all kinds of
other tracks.

460
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:19,804
But I've never seen
anything like these before.

461
00:45:19,847 --> 00:45:23,329
Well, Mr. Kennedy,
did you ever hear anything

462
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:25,113
out of the ordinary
down here?

463
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,376
Well,

464
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,727
I've heard some pretty peculiar things down here,

465
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,165
but I've never seen anything
unusual like this before.

466
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:35,733
I wonder
what moves the creature

467
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:38,039
to pick a particular patch
of woods

468
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:40,781
and return to it
again and again.

469
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:43,175
These woods next
to the bean field

470
00:45:43,218 --> 00:45:45,394
must be one of his
favorite haunts.

471
00:45:48,528 --> 00:45:50,878
More than what
I heard, I guess it was

472
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:53,141
what I didn't hear that
made it kinda spooky.

473
00:45:54,186 --> 00:45:55,927
Even when that tractor
is running

474
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,319
and you can't hear nothing,

475
00:45:57,363 --> 00:46:00,453
you get a funny feeling that

476
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:01,759
something's wrong.

477
00:46:03,021 --> 00:46:05,719
Then, I think, wasn't sure,

478
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:09,070
but I think I'd hear
a low growl, a hoot,
a grunt or something

479
00:46:09,114 --> 00:46:11,246
from back at the trees.

480
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,988
And you know that
someone out there
is watching you.

481
00:46:14,032 --> 00:46:16,425
I tell you, there's some
kind of animal

482
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:18,384
hanging around this field,
all right.

483
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,342
And he's no animal

484
00:46:20,386 --> 00:46:21,909
from this part
of the country.

485
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:26,827
He always
travels Boggy Creek.

486
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:41,380
That's Bessie
Smith's children

487
00:47:41,423 --> 00:47:43,773
playing at the edge of
the woods over there,

488
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:45,863
where Kennedy
heard the creature.

489
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,692
Grandpa! Grandpa!

490
00:47:49,736 --> 00:47:52,347
Grandpa! Grandpa!

491
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:54,262
Be quiet. You're gonna
wake up your grandpa.

492
00:47:54,306 --> 00:47:56,438
I saw him,
I saw that monster.

493
00:47:56,482 --> 00:47:58,353
You're getting filthy
down there...

494
00:47:58,397 --> 00:48:00,312
Grandpa! Grandpa!
We saw the monster.

495
00:48:00,355 --> 00:48:03,315
Be quiet! You're gonna
wake up your grandpa.

496
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:05,273
If you don't be quiet,
you'll get a switch.

497
00:48:05,317 --> 00:48:08,102
Well, Mom, will you come down
and see it if I show you?

498
00:48:08,146 --> 00:48:09,321
Show me what?

499
00:48:09,364 --> 00:48:11,279
-Show you...
-The Fouke monster.

500
00:48:11,323 --> 00:48:13,151
You know there isn't
anything there.

501
00:48:13,194 --> 00:48:15,109
Yes, there is!

502
00:48:15,153 --> 00:48:17,068
Come on, hurry. He might go.

503
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,889
He's over there.

504
00:49:08,597 --> 00:49:10,164
Let's go back home!

505
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:11,557
Come on!

506
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:14,821
Where now? Where did you see it?

507
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:16,562
It was right over there.

508
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:17,737
Right over there.

509
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,608
See, there isn't anything
over there.

510
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:21,436
- Well, there was.
- He was.

511
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,568
He was.

512
00:49:22,611 --> 00:49:23,830
That's where
we saw him last.

513
00:49:33,796 --> 00:49:35,973
Run! Go! Run!

514
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,452
Go! Run!

515
00:49:37,496 --> 00:49:40,978
Run!

516
00:49:56,819 --> 00:49:59,909
That's Charlie Walraven
coming down the road.

517
00:49:59,953 --> 00:50:03,304
This road runs along
the north side of the woods.

518
00:50:03,348 --> 00:50:04,958
It was long about dark.

519
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,700
I was heading into
town that evening.

520
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,876
When I seen this thing coming
out across the road

521
00:50:09,919 --> 00:50:11,617
in front of my car.

522
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:16,274
I just couldn't even
believe what I was watching.

523
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:23,107
You know, I reckon
there's a lot of folks

524
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,586
that don't believe anything

525
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:27,285
until they see it
for themselves.

526
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:28,938
Of course,
if they're like me,

527
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:30,592
they'd be wishing
they hadn't seen

528
00:50:30,636 --> 00:50:31,811
what they did.

529
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:34,727
You know, that thing's gonna

530
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,337
up and kill somebody
one of these days,

531
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:38,209
sure as the world.

532
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:40,733
On a bright, moonlight night like this one,

533
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:42,648
you'd figure he'd
stay out of sight.

534
00:50:42,691 --> 00:50:44,650
But nothing seems
to worry him

535
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:46,913
when the urge to prowl
comes over him.

536
00:50:48,175 --> 00:50:49,785
It could've been
a fatal mistake

537
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:50,960
if the man who lives here

538
00:50:51,004 --> 00:50:52,527
had been home tonight.

539
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:54,703
He has a high-powered
rifle handy,

540
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:56,183
and knows how to use it.

541
00:50:56,227 --> 00:50:57,880
His daughter, Nancy,

542
00:50:57,924 --> 00:50:59,578
has invited
two girlfriends over

543
00:50:59,621 --> 00:51:01,493
for a bunking party.

544
00:51:01,536 --> 00:51:04,452
No, our team's
much better than Arkansas High.

545
00:51:04,496 --> 00:51:06,237
-You know that.
-Arkansas High had a win.

546
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,890
I know,
but they're defensive.

547
00:51:07,934 --> 00:51:11,068
Yeah,
look at their offense.

548
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:12,939
Nancy, I like the way
they cut your hair.

549
00:51:12,982 --> 00:51:14,549
I think it's cute.

550
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:16,551
Well,
Frank liked it long.

551
00:51:16,595 --> 00:51:18,423
He's been sulking
all week.

552
00:51:18,466 --> 00:51:20,120
Now, don't pay
any attention to him,

553
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:22,209
he doesn't know
anything about it.

554
00:51:25,038 --> 00:51:26,300
Did y'all hear something?

555
00:51:28,563 --> 00:51:29,695
That's the wind.

556
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:51,369
I can't see anything.
Do you?

557
00:51:51,412 --> 00:51:53,719
No, I don't see anything.

558
00:51:53,762 --> 00:51:55,242
Then it must've
been the wind.

559
00:51:57,592 --> 00:51:58,941
I hope.

560
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,553
Let's all have a Coke.

561
00:52:01,596 --> 00:52:02,771
Do you all want one?

562
00:52:02,815 --> 00:52:04,773
-Yeah, get me one.
-Yeah.

563
00:52:21,399 --> 00:52:23,140
Nancy, there's somebody
moving around

564
00:52:23,183 --> 00:52:24,271
outside this trailer.

565
00:52:27,927 --> 00:52:30,625
Do you... Do you think
it could be some of the guys?

566
00:52:30,669 --> 00:52:33,237
If it is, I'll kill 'em.

567
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,543
I can't believe it's them.

568
00:52:35,587 --> 00:52:37,937
They went to that game
in Texarkana.

569
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:41,593
Listen.

570
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:47,164
I hear something breathing.

571
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,619
I can hear it, too.

572
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:16,932
Get the gun! Get the gun!

573
00:53:22,895 --> 00:53:24,157
Where are the shells?

574
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,332
Where are the shells?

575
00:53:33,906 --> 00:53:35,037
Go away!

576
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:49,226
Go away!

577
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:55,623
Shh. Shh. Hey, shh. Shh.

578
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,234
I don't hear it anymore.

579
00:53:58,191 --> 00:54:00,062
I don't either.

580
00:54:00,106 --> 00:54:01,847
Be still, I'm gonna look out.

581
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:03,109
No.

582
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:24,609
Next morning
when her parents returned,

583
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:28,308
they would find the girls
still half hysterical
with shock.

584
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:30,528
Before the creature
finally wandered off,

585
00:54:30,571 --> 00:54:32,181
he smashed flower pots

586
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:34,183
and overturned
everything in sight.

587
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,274
These radical changes

588
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:39,319
in his usually
cautious behavior

589
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:42,409
may be caused
by lonely frustration,

590
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:45,673
for he apparently is
the only one of his kind.

591
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:48,850
Normally, he never comes out
of the woods before dusk,

592
00:54:48,894 --> 00:54:51,070
and then moves
very cautiously,

593
00:54:51,113 --> 00:54:52,680
staying within quick return

594
00:54:52,724 --> 00:54:54,421
to the shelter of the trees.

595
00:54:54,465 --> 00:54:56,945
But tonight,
he's on the rampage.

596
00:55:13,135 --> 00:55:14,746
It wasn't the first time
the creature had

597
00:55:14,789 --> 00:55:16,051
prowled in the vicinity

598
00:55:16,095 --> 00:55:18,227
of Howard Walraven's
mobile home,

599
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,491
which is located only
a couple of hundred yards

600
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:23,494
from where Boggy Creek
flows across Highway 71.

601
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:27,498
We heard him
lots of nights.

602
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,064
Sometimes, it sounded like

603
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:30,805
he was right outside
of the window,

604
00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:32,198
it was so loud.

605
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:35,462
And I had my two good dogs

606
00:55:35,506 --> 00:55:37,725
tied up right there
behind the house.

607
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:39,597
And they'd always get excited

608
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,381
and scared, you know,
whenever he'd come around,

609
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:42,774
we heard him,

610
00:55:42,817 --> 00:55:45,864
but, heck, I never figured
he'd attack them.

611
00:55:45,907 --> 00:55:48,693
It just looked to me
like he grabbed my dog

612
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:50,999
and ripped the hide
right off his back.

613
00:55:51,043 --> 00:55:52,740
Now let me tell you something.

614
00:55:52,784 --> 00:55:55,395
He killed the finest dog
that I ever had.

615
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:57,136
But I'm gonna get him
one of these days

616
00:55:57,179 --> 00:55:58,920
and that's gonna be
all she wrote.

617
00:56:04,056 --> 00:56:06,972
Sometimes,
the creature sticks
to one patch of woods

618
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:08,495
for a long time.

619
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:10,845
Then, impulsively
works his way

620
00:56:10,889 --> 00:56:12,238
far up the creeks

621
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:13,892
before being heard from again.

622
00:56:15,546 --> 00:56:17,548
The creeks...

623
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:20,551
He always travels
the creeks.

624
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:22,553
When he next showed up,

625
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:24,555
it was several miles upstream.

626
00:56:27,427 --> 00:56:30,474
In the spring, this house was rented to two young couples

627
00:56:30,517 --> 00:56:32,824
who moved in together
to save money.

628
00:57:06,379 --> 00:57:08,076
They were Charles Turner,

629
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:10,601
his wife, Anne,

630
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,212
and Don Ford,

631
00:57:13,255 --> 00:57:15,475
who was Anne Turner's brother.

632
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,521
And Don's wife, Sue.

633
00:57:18,696 --> 00:57:21,350
Each couple had a small child.

634
00:57:21,394 --> 00:57:23,309
Don and Charles had just
been hired

635
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:25,616
by a big cattle ranch
in the Fouke area.

636
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:28,357
Since both men
would be required

637
00:57:28,401 --> 00:57:29,663
to work late at night,

638
00:57:29,707 --> 00:57:31,709
the girls would be
company to each other.

639
00:57:37,323 --> 00:57:38,585
Thank you. Thank you.

640
00:57:39,717 --> 00:57:41,893
The two families
moved in on Monday.

641
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:43,851
Thursday night,

642
00:57:43,895 --> 00:57:45,549
the first of a series

643
00:57:45,592 --> 00:57:47,855
of hair-raising
incidents occurred.

644
00:59:15,029 --> 00:59:16,640
Shh!

645
00:59:16,683 --> 00:59:18,032
What's the matter?

646
00:59:18,076 --> 00:59:19,207
Shh.

647
00:59:24,909 --> 00:59:26,737
-Did you hear that?
-Yeah.

648
00:59:59,987 --> 01:00:02,163
That chair... Put that chair
under the door.

649
01:00:49,907 --> 01:00:51,604
Who do you suppose
that was?

650
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:53,911
I don't know.

651
01:00:53,954 --> 01:00:56,000
Let's take the kids
and go to the landlord's.

652
01:01:48,226 --> 01:01:49,706
I had a pretty good look around

653
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:51,098
and I couldn't find a thing.

654
01:01:51,142 --> 01:01:53,448
Are you sure you don't
want to go back to my place

655
01:01:53,492 --> 01:01:54,754
till the men get here?

656
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:56,669
No, no. That's okay

657
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,758
if you checked and you're sure
there's nothing here,

658
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:00,194
then we'll be okay, I think.

659
01:02:00,238 --> 01:02:01,805
I couldn't find a thing.

660
01:02:01,848 --> 01:02:04,285
But I'll come back
in a little while
and check on you.

661
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:05,939
Okay, listen, mister,

662
01:02:05,983 --> 01:02:08,115
we sure do thank you
and we appreciate it

663
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:10,335
-so much...
-Well, you're welcome.

664
01:02:10,378 --> 01:02:12,293
I'll wait here till
you get in the house.

665
01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:13,860
Okay. Buh-bye.

666
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:14,905
Bye.

667
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:31,530
The next day, Friday,

668
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:33,575
the Fords and Turners
had visitors.

669
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:36,013
Don Ford's younger brother,
Bobby Ford,

670
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:38,145
and a cousin,
12-year-old Corky Hill,

671
01:02:38,189 --> 01:02:39,799
arrived for the weekend.

672
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:42,193
They'd heard about the great fishing around Fouke

673
01:02:42,236 --> 01:02:44,238
and were anxious
to wet a hook.

674
01:02:44,282 --> 01:02:46,110
Y'all be back before dark.

675
01:02:46,153 --> 01:02:48,286
Yeah, yeah.
We're gonna bring back
some supper.

676
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:06,233
Bobby.

677
01:04:06,277 --> 01:04:08,496
Who told you the fishing
was good here?

678
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,109
They're here.
Just have patience.

679
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:50,974
Bobby, come here. Come here!

680
01:04:52,758 --> 01:04:54,325
What do you want?

681
01:04:54,368 --> 01:04:55,892
Just come here. Come here!

682
01:05:13,344 --> 01:05:15,912
Boy, look at the size of
that guy's footprint!

683
01:05:16,738 --> 01:05:18,218
That ain't no footprint.

684
01:05:20,873 --> 01:05:21,918
That's funny.

685
01:05:21,961 --> 01:05:23,397
What's so funny
about that?

686
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:25,225
He's only got three toes!

687
01:05:34,626 --> 01:05:36,019
Well, it's getting
kinda late,

688
01:05:36,062 --> 01:05:37,542
and the fish
aren't biting anyway,

689
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:38,847
so I think we oughta go.

690
01:05:40,762 --> 01:05:42,547
Sure is spooky
down here.

691
01:05:55,908 --> 01:05:58,998
I still say, that's the biggest
foot that I've ever seen.

692
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:00,130
No.

693
01:08:09,868 --> 01:08:12,088
Shh. I think I hear something.

694
01:08:36,851 --> 01:08:37,852
Go get Annie and Sue.

695
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,424
Get up, get up.
Bobby heard something.

696
01:08:48,646 --> 01:08:50,517
My gosh.
It's back.

697
01:08:52,084 --> 01:08:54,260
Shh. I heard something.

698
01:08:58,395 --> 01:08:59,613
Shh!

699
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:02,050
Is that him back?

700
01:09:02,094 --> 01:09:03,226
It's gotta be.

701
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:11,756
Corky, go get the kids.

702
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:34,648
I seen him!
He's coming around the porch!

703
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,522
Bobby, put that chair
under the door.

704
01:10:16,516 --> 01:10:18,039
I think I heard a car.

705
01:10:21,826 --> 01:10:24,220
It's Don and Charles.

706
01:10:26,134 --> 01:10:29,399
Hey, Don. Hey, Don.
Listen, listen. I swear...

707
01:10:29,442 --> 01:10:31,879
You wouldn't
believe what happened.

708
01:10:31,923 --> 01:10:33,490
You wouldn't
believe what happened.

709
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:35,013
I've never seen
nothing like this.

710
01:10:35,056 --> 01:10:37,102
-All right. Hold it. Hold it.
-You wouldn't believe it.

711
01:10:37,145 --> 01:10:38,756
You wouldn't
believe what happened.

712
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:40,845
I just can't
believe what happened.

713
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:42,368
- I just can't...
- I'm sorry, I ain't...

714
01:10:42,412 --> 01:10:44,196
Calm down.
Everybody's talking at once.

715
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,719
That's right.
I saw it.

716
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,287
All right, just calm down.

717
01:10:48,331 --> 01:10:50,115
He's been around
this house.

718
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:51,638
We can't all talk
at one time.

719
01:10:51,682 --> 01:10:52,944
I told you there was
something funny

720
01:10:52,987 --> 01:10:54,467
about that footprint I found.

721
01:10:54,511 --> 01:10:55,773
I just told you there was.

722
01:10:55,816 --> 01:10:58,645
Charles, this is the second timein two nights

723
01:10:58,689 --> 01:11:01,082
that someone has been
around this house.

724
01:11:01,126 --> 01:11:03,955
I think you oughta get
some protection, man.

725
01:11:03,998 --> 01:11:05,957
Think we oughta
go to the landlord's
to get the gun?

726
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,350
That'd be a great idea.

727
01:11:07,393 --> 01:11:09,134
Why don't you go down
and get the gun

728
01:11:09,177 --> 01:11:11,484
- I'll stay here
with them...
Be careful.

729
01:11:11,528 --> 01:11:14,182
...and everything will be
a little quieter.

730
01:11:14,226 --> 01:11:15,749
Okay, I'm going
to go with you.

731
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:19,013
We're have a gun here
so y'all don't be scared.

732
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:20,624
Go on in the house.

733
01:11:57,269 --> 01:12:00,141
No way. No.

734
01:12:00,185 --> 01:12:02,056
I'm just glad Charles
and Don are home.

735
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,362
Yeah, me too.

736
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Listen, Corky,
you gotta get some sleep
and so do you.
I'm gonna go on the bed.
Okay.

737
01:12:13,677 --> 01:12:15,374
What happened?
What happened?

738
01:12:15,418 --> 01:12:17,158
I saw him!

739
01:12:17,202 --> 01:12:19,683
I swear, I ain't ever seen
nothing like it in my life.

740
01:12:19,726 --> 01:12:22,163
He just came through there.
I saw him.

741
01:12:22,207 --> 01:12:24,122
He was long and hairy.

742
01:12:24,165 --> 01:12:27,386
-It was like a bear
or something.
-Hold it, hold it, hold it.

743
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:29,432
Hold it. Don, go get the light

744
01:12:29,475 --> 01:12:30,955
and we'll go see
what this thing is.

745
01:12:33,261 --> 01:12:34,567
All right, once more.

746
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:37,570
If he's out here,
let's get him now.

747
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:40,617
I'll look back here,
just a minute.

748
01:12:43,663 --> 01:12:46,013
Keep your eyes open.

749
01:12:46,057 --> 01:12:48,755
Say, I ain't scared,
this ain't no thing.

750
01:12:50,931 --> 01:12:52,193
What's that right there?

751
01:12:52,237 --> 01:12:53,673
That right over there?

752
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:55,893
Is that him right there?

753
01:12:55,936 --> 01:12:57,851
Yeah, that's him.

754
01:12:57,895 --> 01:12:59,287
You better say something
out there.

755
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:01,942
-You better say something.
-Hey, man.

756
01:13:01,986 --> 01:13:04,292
-Gonna shoot.
-Shoot him.
He's not saying anything.

757
01:13:04,336 --> 01:13:05,990
Shoot him.
Shoot him!

758
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:08,340
Shoot him!

759
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:13,389
See, right there.

760
01:13:20,744 --> 01:13:22,485
-Get him?
-I don't know.

761
01:13:22,528 --> 01:13:25,836
-Hey, I think you got him.
-I don't see a thing.

762
01:13:25,879 --> 01:13:27,315
Shine your light over here.

763
01:13:28,882 --> 01:13:30,406
I don't see anything.

764
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:31,668
Nothing out there either.

765
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:33,321
I think that you got him.

766
01:13:33,365 --> 01:13:35,106
Hey, let's go get the sheriff.

767
01:13:37,674 --> 01:13:39,676
Hey, let us through,
will you?

768
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:41,765
All right, leave the gun
here with me.

769
01:13:43,027 --> 01:13:44,594
Did you shoot him?

770
01:13:44,637 --> 01:13:46,857
We don't know. We don't even
know if we hit it.

771
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:49,076
He's going after the sheriff.
I'm gonna stay here.

772
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,818
-I'm gonna go with him,
all right?
-Go inside.

773
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:53,951
Hurry back.

774
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,727
There's something here
outside of the house.

775
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:32,076
What did it look like?

776
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:33,556
Well, best I can tell,

777
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:37,298
the thing was tall
and had a lot of hair.
Red eyes.

778
01:14:37,342 --> 01:14:39,649
-Find anything, Constable?
-Not yet.

779
01:14:39,692 --> 01:14:41,825
This piece been like this
the whole time?

780
01:14:41,868 --> 01:14:43,130
No, sir, it hasn't.

781
01:14:43,174 --> 01:14:44,523
Have you looked in
under there?

782
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:46,307
No, sir, we haven't
looked down there.

783
01:14:48,962 --> 01:14:51,095
This is a panther track
and her little cub

784
01:14:51,138 --> 01:14:52,662
with it under this house.

785
01:14:52,705 --> 01:14:54,968
You mean a panther's
been living under the house?

786
01:14:55,012 --> 01:14:56,927
That's what it is.
It's a panther track.

787
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:59,538
That wasn't any panther
we shot at, Constable.

788
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:03,411
That's what that track is.

789
01:15:03,455 --> 01:15:06,763
You keep this shotgun
and this light, these shells,

790
01:15:06,806 --> 01:15:09,069
and if you need me,
you come ask.

791
01:15:09,113 --> 01:15:10,723
Okay, sir, we sure will.

792
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:12,638
I'm gonna drive
up the highway

793
01:15:12,682 --> 01:15:14,988
to see if I can see anything.

794
01:15:15,032 --> 01:15:16,424
We'd sure appreciate it.-Yeah.

795
01:15:16,468 --> 01:15:18,644
And I'll pick the gun up
tomorrow sometime.

796
01:15:18,688 --> 01:15:20,254
I sure do thank you
for coming by.

797
01:15:20,298 --> 01:15:21,647
-You're welcome.
-Thank you, sir.

798
01:15:21,691 --> 01:15:23,736
You're welcome. If you need me,
give me a call.

799
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:25,564
Okay, we sure will.

800
01:15:25,608 --> 01:15:27,131
-We're damn glad you came.
-Yeah.

801
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:28,262
- Good night.
- Good night.

802
01:15:28,306 --> 01:15:29,916
What kind of place is this?

803
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,789
I mean, we have a panther
living under the house,

804
01:15:32,832 --> 01:15:34,617
somebody trying to break in?

805
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,793
Well, we've got the flashlights,we've got the guns.

806
01:15:36,836 --> 01:15:38,098
Now let's all go to bed

807
01:15:38,142 --> 01:15:39,622
-and get some rest.
-I'm with you.

808
01:15:39,665 --> 01:15:41,667
Let's go to bed.
Come on, Annie.

809
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:43,451
Let's go. Come on, Annie.

810
01:15:43,495 --> 01:15:44,931
I gotta stay here with
the thing coming in
through the window?

811
01:15:44,975 --> 01:15:48,587
Don't worry about it.
We got the guns.

812
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:51,285
I don't wanna stay here
no more with that thing...

813
01:15:52,243 --> 01:15:53,853
I gotta go to the bathroom.

814
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

815
01:16:30,194 --> 01:16:31,674
What's the matter?

816
01:16:31,717 --> 01:16:34,459
Back there.
Tried to come through
the window.

817
01:16:34,502 --> 01:16:35,634
What's the matter?

818
01:16:35,678 --> 01:16:37,636
My God!

819
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,638
Right there. Right there.

820
01:16:39,682 --> 01:16:42,510
Tried to come in through
the window.

821
01:16:42,554 --> 01:16:44,600
Get your gun, Charles.
Let's go.

822
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:12,628
There he is!

823
01:17:13,716 --> 01:17:15,065
Hold this, Bobby.

824
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:17,850
Bobby, take the light.

825
01:17:34,214 --> 01:17:36,173
You got him.
That's it! He fell.

826
01:17:46,357 --> 01:17:48,228
I think you got him, man.

827
01:17:48,272 --> 01:17:49,795
I think I saw him fall
over there.

828
01:17:50,404 --> 01:17:51,492
Let's go see.

829
01:17:52,493 --> 01:17:54,104
Be careful.

830
01:17:54,147 --> 01:17:57,716
Be careful!

831
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,849
Don't get too far.
Come back!

832
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,236
Somebody come back here!

833
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:41,586
Bobby, will you go back
and take care of the girls?

834
01:18:41,629 --> 01:18:42,718
Charlie...

835
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

836
01:18:56,688 --> 01:18:59,082
Help! Bobby!

837
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:24,934
When Bobby
could not be aroused

838
01:19:24,977 --> 01:19:26,544
from the state of shock
he was in,

839
01:19:26,587 --> 01:19:28,154
everyone piled into the car

840
01:19:28,198 --> 01:19:30,461
and raced to Constable
Walraven's house for help.

841
01:19:30,504 --> 01:19:32,550
Walraven took one look
at Bobby,

842
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:34,247
arranged a police escort

843
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:36,772
and sent them on
to the hospital in Texarkana.

844
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:35,700
Nurse, what do you think's wrongwith him? He hasn't said a thingin the car on the way here.

845
01:20:35,743 --> 01:20:37,354
Let's check him up.

846
01:20:37,397 --> 01:20:40,879
Doesn't move.
Hasn't said a word.
Breathing's kinda funny.

847
01:20:40,923 --> 01:20:42,663
You think he'll be all right?

848
01:20:42,707 --> 01:20:46,232
Let's check.
We'll let you know.

849
01:20:46,276 --> 01:20:49,714
Blood pressure's 60 over 40.
I think we better start
an IV.

850
01:20:49,757 --> 01:20:51,020
He's in a state of shock.

851
01:20:52,195 --> 01:20:53,892
Bobby recovered swiftly,

852
01:20:53,936 --> 01:20:55,894
and the Fords and Turners
moved away.

853
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,592
They don't plan on coming back.

854
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:06,905
What the creature was after
inside the Ford house

855
01:21:06,949 --> 01:21:09,081
is perhaps
the biggest mystery of all.

856
01:21:23,269 --> 01:21:24,792
I was thinking about it today

857
01:21:24,836 --> 01:21:26,142
when I decided to drive out

858
01:21:26,185 --> 01:21:27,839
to our old home place,

859
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,885
now run down
and abandoned.

860
01:21:30,755 --> 01:21:32,148
Standing out in this field,

861
01:21:32,191 --> 01:21:34,367
it all comes rushing back.

862
01:21:34,411 --> 01:21:37,240
And an icy tingle
starts down my spine

863
01:21:37,283 --> 01:21:38,589
when I recall that

864
01:21:38,632 --> 01:21:41,548
terrible, lonesome cry.

865
01:22:00,872 --> 01:22:02,743
It was so long ago that

866
01:22:02,787 --> 01:22:05,964
it seems incredible that the creature is still out there

867
01:22:06,008 --> 01:22:08,575
somewhere right this minute,

868
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:10,926
maybe even watching me.

869
01:22:18,194 --> 01:22:20,065
Of course, you may not
believe that,

870
01:22:20,109 --> 01:22:23,112
or any of this story.

871
01:22:23,155 --> 01:22:25,462
You may think
the whole thing is a hoax.

872
01:22:25,505 --> 01:22:27,507
And that's your privilege.

873
01:22:31,598 --> 01:22:33,122
But if you're ever driving down

874
01:22:33,165 --> 01:22:35,515
in our country
along about sundown,

875
01:22:35,559 --> 01:22:37,691
keep an eye
on the dark woods

876
01:22:37,735 --> 01:22:39,998
as you cross
the Sulphur River Bottoms,

877
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:41,608
and you may
catch a glimpse

878
01:22:41,652 --> 01:22:43,741
of a huge, hairy creature

879
01:22:43,784 --> 01:22:45,830
watching you from the shadows.

880
01:22:49,051 --> 01:22:51,053
Yes, he's still here.

881
01:22:51,096 --> 01:22:53,272
And you know,
I'd almost like to hear

882
01:22:53,316 --> 01:22:55,057
that terrible cry again

883
01:22:55,883 --> 01:22:57,450
just to be reminded

884
01:22:57,494 --> 01:23:00,584
that there is still a bit of
wilderness left.

885
01:23:00,627 --> 01:23:04,370
and there are still mysteries
that remain unsolved,

886
01:23:04,414 --> 01:23:07,330
and strange, unexplained noises

887
01:23:07,373 --> 01:23:08,766
in the night.
