1
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,793
You don't have to hold just on me,

2
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,261
you know.
I'm not even in character.

3
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,663
Just catch the atmosphere,
get the feeling.

4
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,533
Feel the place. God, Mary.

5
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,535
Get that tree, that's good.

6
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,337
MARY: That?
Yeah, just get the tree.

7
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:38,538
Why?
You got it?

8
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,173
Because we have to film everything.

9
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,741
I need atmosphere, all right?
I gotta get the setting.

10
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:44,743
It's a desert.

11
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,412
For God's sake.

12
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,948
Feels hot.

13
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,485
Wait until you see it.

14
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,889
You are going to be amazed.

15
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:04,696
<i>♪ We're gonna have a little party</i>

16
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:10,469
<i>♪ And we got some
special people comin' ♪</i>

17
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,539
Ready? Behold the gates.

18
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:19,079
MARY:
Oh, my God, it's a dump.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,414
What the hell are
you talkin' about?

20
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,616
It's a hell of a lot
better than last time.

21
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,057
Look, it's isolated, we got room
for everybody, it is perfect.

22
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,955
Welcome home.

23
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,065
FATHER SIMON: Mary?

24
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,068
Mary?

25
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,075
(GUNSHOTS)

26
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,317
(GUNSHOT)

27
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,078
FATHER SIMON: <i>What did
we do wrong last time?</i>

28
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,759
If you'll recall,

29
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,628
somebody got a little
antsy and lost control.

30
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:46,865
(SHOOTS GUN)

31
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,504
So this time

32
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,907
let's streamline the plot.

33
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:58,810
(SHOOTS GUN)

34
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,383
FATHER SIMON:
No fuckin' around,

35
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,787
no losing control.

36
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,721
Let's keep it simple.

37
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,625
Nobody gets antsy

38
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,131
(SHOOTS GUN)

39
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,700
and nobody gets away.

40
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,577
FATHER SIMON: <i>Here, one box,
then we'll be ready to start.</i>

41
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,077
Okay, get the camera ready.

42
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,517
All right.

43
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:41,287
Okay, you ready?
All right, frame me up. Okay.

44
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,724
So, this is our church set.

45
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,859
Crude, but simplistic.

46
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,528
I've always been an admirer
of the Spartan approach.

47
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,833
Clothes make the man.

48
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,369
No seams on the sides,
bigger shoulder line.

49
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,538
Short sleeves make
me look taller, right?

50
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,007
Nice? Beautiful? Yeah.

51
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,942
Uh...

52
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:06,913
A few quasi-religious props.

53
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:10,984
You need a central focus.
Pull their eyes here.

54
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:13,786
Humans are so easily distracted.

55
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,355
Keep your eye on the birdie,
right?

56
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:19,025
(SHOUTS)

57
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,326
(CHUCKLES)

58
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,928
Didn't see that comin', did you?

59
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,463
You can't just
dress like Superman

60
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,265
and expect to
fuckin' fly, can you, huh?

61
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,935
No, you can't.
You must have movement,
dynamic movement.

62
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,670
Spread your arms wide. Kneel.

63
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,973
Eyes straight ahead.

64
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:37,977
Dynamic finger movement,
always slightly curled.
You see?

65
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:41,948
The voice that I'm using right
now is clearly designed

66
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:46,386
to make you, against all of
your better judgment like me.

67
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:51,189
But you drop down the tone,
just ever so slightly.

68
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,527
We face you.

69
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:58,731
We speak to you with a
slightly halting cadence.

70
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,668
Questioning, searching eyes.

71
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:06,004
A quietly discomforting, although
caring, effect can be achieved.

72
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,875
Do you see?

73
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:14,580
Well then we get deep down in
fuck-you-in-the-ass territory.

74
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,882
And that's a place
I like to be, baby.

75
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,718
So here it is.

76
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,088
This is our playroom.

77
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:26,858
Let's play.

78
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,732
Looks like I'm
heading to Mexico.

79
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,004
I wanna share
something with you.

80
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:45,143
This is the last thing I got from
my sister before she disappeared.

81
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,616
"Dear El,

82
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,419
"I wish you could
be here with me.

83
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,856
"Every day is
a perfect experience.

84
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,258
"Father Simon has shown me what
a beautiful person I really am.

85
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,065
"I know you won't understand
this, but it's what I needed.

86
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,133
"I feel like I am finally home.

87
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:10,869
"Love, Janet."

88
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,906
That is not my sister.

89
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:24,751
I'm now about 200 Ks
south of the U.S. border.

90
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,952
They said they'd
meet me here at noon.

91
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,821
(VAN APPROACHING)

92
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,691
ELLEN: Hey.

93
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,126
MARY: Are you Ellen?

94
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:36,761
Yeah.

95
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,296
I'm Mary.

96
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,599
Hop in.

97
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,735
Guys, this is Ellen.

98
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,003
Hey.

99
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,604
Hey.
Hi.

100
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,672
Hey.

101
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,809
It's hot out there.

102
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,144
Where are you from?

103
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,150
London.
Oh.

104
00:06:57,151 --> 00:07:00,019
Like fish and chips
and stuff? (CHUCKLES)

105
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,089
I've never left
the state before.

106
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,690
Well, you're a long
way from home now.

107
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,560
Yeah. Long way from home.

108
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:10,228
Bye, home.
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

109
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,746
You must be Ellen.

110
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,283
Welcome.

111
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,153
It's good to be here.

112
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,562
<i>Hi, my name is Simon Leach.</i>

113
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,898
I'm 42 years old.
I'm from Alabama.

114
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,166
And I love my new
life in his service.

115
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:27,240
<i>My life was a mess</i>
<i>when he found me.</i>

116
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:30,909
<i>I was just another lost soul looking
for meaning in the emptiness.</i>

117
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,713
<i>I drank and I drugged.</i>

118
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,516
Slept with wayward women,

119
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,117
lost myself in all kinds of
sinful distractions.

120
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,788
<i>And then one day,</i>

121
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,191
<i>in a moment of deep personal
darkness, he found me.</i>

122
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:51,163
<i>I had blood on my hands,</i>
<i>hate in my heart,</i>

123
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,497
<i>but he didn't judge me.</i>

124
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,836
<i>He set my spirit free that day.</i>

125
00:08:56,837 --> 00:09:00,105
I promised him I'd do anything
I could to repay him.

126
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,891
ELLEN: <i> Well, I finally</i>
<i>arrived at the compound.</i>

127
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,928
Looks like this is
gonna be my new room.

128
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,768
Not quite sure
who my roommate is yet though.

129
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,783
FATHER SIMON: Hey, Mary.
Give me a little smile.

130
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,988
That's my sunshine girl.

131
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,912
Shit!
FATHER SIMON: Hey.

132
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,846
Sorry.
What's with the camera?

133
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,853
You settling in okay?

134
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:21,988
Yeah, I'm fine.

135
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,122
FATHER SIMON: Need anything?

136
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,856
No, I'm good.

137
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,932
You have a really pretty face.

138
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,600
You look good on camera.

139
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,203
Thanks.

140
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,447
FATHER SIMON:
Hey, we're glad you're here.

141
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,211
Thanks.

142
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,464
They've locked me up in this
room so I have time to reflect.

143
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,567
Hold on.

144
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,870
What is that?

145
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,944
(FAINT SCREAMING)

146
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,881
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

147
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,014
Shit.

148
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,690
Let me give you a little lesson

149
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:31,991
in costume design.
Do you mind?

150
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,994
MARY: Okay, go. Yeah.
Is it okay? Yeah?

151
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:39,065
Earth tones, they
calm the brain. Neutrals.

152
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,867
You'll always find priests and religious
figures wearing neutral tones.

153
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,936
Whites.

154
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,806
Look at altars, you'll
find soft neutral tones.

155
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:50,009
Bright colors excite the mind
and we don't want that.

156
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,480
So we've got an array of neutral
tones, of sands and whites.

157
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:58,217
What do you think? Hold on.

158
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,087
What do you think?
Wait, this is kind of
a western vibe here.

159
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,354
It's very friendly.

160
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,156
Hi, I'm Father Simon.

161
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,025
I'm glad you're here.

162
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,493
Tell me a little about yourself.
What do you think?

163
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,863
MARY: No.

164
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,064
No?
No.

165
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,899
Fine. Okay.

166
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,600
What do you think?
What do you think?

167
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,939
Nice? Yeah?
Yeah.

168
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,941
Hey, welcome.
Where are you from?
Tell me about your family.

169
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,142
Who gives a fuck?

170
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,745
(LAUGHS)

171
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,679
No, but seriously,
tell me about yourself.

172
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,249
Yeah. Yeah, what do you think?

173
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,884
MARY: Yeah.

174
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:32,985
Yeah? Button-down?

175
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,220
MARY: Try the last one.

176
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,421
I don't like that color.

177
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,123
Damn, woman.

178
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,891
All right, what do you see?
What do you like?

179
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,760
Yeah, I like that one.

180
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:41,894
FATHER SIMON: Hi.

181
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:42,961
Welcome.

182
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,099
I wanna tell you
that I care about you.

183
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,500
Don't tell any of
the other children this, but

184
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,236
you're probably my favorite.

185
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,506
I love you.

186
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,878
I love you.

187
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:04,150
FATHER SIMON: This is the next in a series
of entrance interviews with Sister Tracy.

188
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:06,117
Entrance interview
with Brother Alan.

189
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,554
Brother Ben.

190
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,990
Robin.

191
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,959
Entrance interview,
Brother Brian.

192
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,760
Entrance interview,
Brother Frank.

193
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,497
Entrance interview,
Sister Grace.

194
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,569
Veronica.

195
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,106
Welcome, Sister.

196
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,340
Thank you, Father.

197
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,375
We're glad you're here.

198
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:30,976
I'm really glad to be here.

199
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,113
The purpose of the interview is

200
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:37,016
for you to let people
know why you're here,

201
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:40,151
how you came to be here, and
how you feel about being here.

202
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,686
Okay.

203
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,091
FATHER SIMON:
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

204
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,093
<i>Are you willing to be completely
and totally honest with me?</i>

205
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,228
About everything?

206
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,362
Yeah.

207
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,331
'Cause like, I didn't have...

208
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:57,002
Because I didn't have anywhere
else to go, I guess and I...

209
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,504
Um...

210
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:03,976
<i>'Cause everything else</i>
<i>was really bad and I...</i>

211
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,578
Hey, Alan, what...
What was bad?

212
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,613
You say things were bad,
everything was bad.

213
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,647
What was bad?
I don't know.

214
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:11,816
You'd run away, hadn't you?

215
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,154
You'd run away from home?

216
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,691
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Why?</i>

217
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:29,500
I couldn't live there anymore.

218
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,872
Um... More physically...

219
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,705
Did you have sex with him?

220
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,243
I did.

221
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,443
How old were you?

222
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,212
Seventeen.

223
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,914
How old was he?

224
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,083
Forty-four.

225
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,751
FATHER SIMON: <i> What is a man?</i>
<i>What's a man to you?</i>

226
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,662
A man's strong and he's able to

227
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,130
take care of himself and

228
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,503
he's not
a failure in life and...

229
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,972
You think you're a failure?

230
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:10,109
BEN:
<i>But as I got older, the</i>

231
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,643
<i>drinking got worse and</i>

232
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,782
it became drinking and

233
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,651
beating and

234
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,989
fucking and

235
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,958
drinking and
beating and fucking,

236
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,326
and drinking and
beating and fucking,

237
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,627
and drinking and
beating and fucking.

238
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,396
I didn't leave a family.

239
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:34,066
I left a woman and a man

240
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,801
living for themselves and wanting
me to live for them as well.

241
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,304
You need to be yourself.

242
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,473
<i>You need that.</i>

243
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,344
<i>And I never got that.</i>

244
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,580
And that's what I want.

245
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,688
I...

246
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,660
I lost someone really close
to me a while ago.

247
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,329
FATHER SIMON: I'm sorry.

248
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,533
And I...

249
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,204
I kind of pushed everyone away.

250
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,142
FATHER SIMON: As you can see,
we don't have much.

251
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,179
But I'll tell you what,
we make do.

252
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,383
And here's some of our
children doing their laundry.

253
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,518
Hey, Brother Ben. How are you?
What do you got there?

254
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,521
Got your laundry there?

255
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,792
Looks good, nice and clean.

256
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,196
All right, carry on, Brother.

257
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,335
We have Sister Grace,
Sister Ellen.

258
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,336
Hi, Father Simon.

259
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,542
Better be careful in there,
you might get a tidal wave.

260
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:53,911
(WOMEN EXCLAIMING)
(FATHER SIMON LAUGHING)

261
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,325
Well, it's...

262
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,596
It's really not what I expected.

263
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:13,798
But this group of people, I
don't think they'd hurt anyone.

264
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,335
ELLEN: <i> Simon is</i>
<i>definitely a crook, but</i>

265
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,937
<i>I don't think he's murderous.</i>

266
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,277
Mary's creepy, though.

267
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,878
<i>Every time I'm around her,</i>
<i>my skin crawls.</i>

268
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,284
I don't know.

269
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,921
MARY:
Why are we getting this again?

270
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,392
'Cause we need the happy stuff.

271
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,860
Okay?

272
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,204
FATHER SIMON: Hey, guys.

273
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,573
Hi, Father Simon.
Father Simon.

274
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,141
So we're gonna
have a camera chat

275
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,444
and we're gonna find out
about what you're doing

276
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:03,248
and tell everybody what we
do here, Sister Veronica.

277
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,784
With your sweet smile.
And your nice dancing eyes.

278
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,320
Are you Irish?

279
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,855
Yeah, I am.

280
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,324
You look like you got
some Irish in you there.

281
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,425
Why don't you tell the people
what you're doing?

282
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,462
We're sewing our caftans.

283
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,700
To be ready for our transition.

284
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,769
And each of
the children got to choose

285
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,671
their own
pattern for the caftan.

286
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,406
Right? Yeah?
That's right. Yes.

287
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:31,443
So I'm guessing
yours is stylish?

288
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,513
I don't know what it's gonna turn out like.
It's not that good.

289
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,381
It's gonna be great, yeah.

290
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,450
Thank you, Father Simon.

291
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,421
It's really great being here

292
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,457
because everyone is
really nice to me.

293
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,793
Father Simon is...

294
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,262
Just makes me feel at home

295
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:54,666
and everyone else makes me feel
like I'm part of a family.

296
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,401
FATHER SIMON: You are at home
and you are part of the family.

297
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,806
Thank you, my dear. So sweet.

298
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,241
Seamstress Robin.

299
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,775
Hard at work.

300
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:08,780
She probably knows
the size of needles to use.

301
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:11,617
If I had a sewing
machine for you, I bet you

302
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:12,918
could just crank out
all kinds of things.

303
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,319
I wish.

304
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,221
This is good, though.

305
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:19,591
These needles are good for
getting through the fabric.

306
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,727
You probably wouldn't mind
sewing everyone's caftan.

307
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,462
(LAUGHING)

308
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,397
Well, but then they wouldn't
each be different.

309
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,932
They'd all be the same.

310
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:30,402
And that's just
a little part of the lesson,

311
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:34,640
preparing your own caftans
because I prepared my own.

312
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:38,944
We're family and each family
member has a responsibility

313
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:42,414
and we work together
all for the common good.

314
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:45,350
I am an idealist at heart

315
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:49,221
and I'm still idealistic
enough even at this age to

316
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:52,324
believe that it's possible to
work together for something good.

317
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,425
You guys with me?

318
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,493
Yes, Father Simon!

319
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:55,760
Okay.

320
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,198
Blessings on you, Sister.

321
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,732
MAN: Go, go, go, go, go!
WOMAN: All right, come on.

322
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:01,799
WOMAN: Whoo!

323
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,406
MAN: All the way home.
All the way home. Nice.

324
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,549
Go, go, go, go, go!

325
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,754
Mary, Mary, Mary.

326
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,431
I don't know what to say.

327
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,467
It's fantastic.

328
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,539
Where the hell did you get this?

329
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,009
I like it, it's good.
It's a bent candle, it's nice.

330
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,879
Universal religious symbolism
mixed with a little pagan shit.

331
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,882
So the parrot turns to the
magician on the raft and he says,

332
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,318
"Okay, I give up.
How'd you do the trick?"

333
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,022
(ALL LAUGHING)

334
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,457
Is there love in this room?

335
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,625
GROUP: Yes, Father.

336
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,492
Is there happiness in this room?

337
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,693
Yes, Father.

338
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:02,794
Is there trust in this room?

339
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,363
Yes, Father.

340
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,565
Take a step back.

341
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:09,668
'Cause sometimes we need to trust
each other with a big thing.

342
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,970
Not just a small thing.

343
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:14,006
Yes?
Yes, Father.

344
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:17,141
And we send trust to you,
Brother Frank.

345
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,076
One,

346
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:20,878
two,

347
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,247
three!

348
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,553
Hug your brothers and sisters!

349
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:29,820
Yes.

350
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,858
Yes.

351
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,328
FATHER SIMON: Other people...

352
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,828
GROUP: Other people...

353
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,731
<i>are shadows.</i>

354
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,433
<i>are shadows.</i>

355
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,368
<i>We let the shadows go.</i>

356
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,370
<i>We let the shadows go.</i>

357
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:46,905

00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,170
that I was trying to hurt you?

538
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:02,373
Have I done anything
to earn the distrust?

539
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,242
I need to know... I need to
know what happened to Janet.

540
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:09,946
I need to know.
I need to know why she died.

541
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,724
You weren't truthful with me,
but I'll be truthful with you.

542
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,791
She died because of you.

543
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,029
That's not true.

544
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,538
We shared
everything with each other.

545
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:36,673
Did you?
Did you know she
tried to kill herself?

546
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:40,144
You're lying.

547
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:41,646
Right after her husband left
and took the kids.

548
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:44,816
No, she was depressed
and we talked about it.

549
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,484
She stopped drinking
and she went to therapy.

550
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:50,621
Now that I did know.
That helped for a while.

551
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:51,688
For a while.

552
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,362
She was so lonely.

553
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,831
Poor Janet.

554
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,536
But that all changed
the day she found our website.

555
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,541
She told me that was the day

556
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,877
she felt she was finally able to
connect with someone, really connect.

557
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,885
She confessed her sins.

558
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,691
The next day she
moved into our church.

559
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,829
Would you like to
know how she died?

560
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,832
What happened?

561
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,437
We were fine.

562
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:42,840
Everything was fine until stories
began to appear in the...

563
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,441
Stories that were true.

564
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,679
Lies.

565
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,581
The same thing that always happens
when people come across something

566
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,683
they don't
understand and they need

567
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,517
an easy answer to
explain it away.

568
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,290
And when the lies came,
the police came.

569
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,691
That's what brought
the police to our door.

570
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,627
So why did you shoot at them?

571
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:06,497
We didn't.
They came in shooting.

572
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,366
We tried to hide in the main room.
They burned us out.

573
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,903
She saved my life.

574
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:19,911
She was proud of you.

575
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:21,779
No, she wasn't.

576
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,848
She always talked about you.

577
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,582
Her beautiful sister.

578
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,451
She was so proud of you.

579
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,322
She was happy, Ellen.

580
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:32,789
She was happy.

581
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,698
Look, I'm sorry I made you
cry, but now you understand

582
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,367
why we tape
everything around here.

583
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,236
Because people don't understand,

584
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:46,870
because people
get the wrong ideas.

585
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,376
And I'll be damned if I will
let any one of my followers

586
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,913
ever be hurt by anybody.

587
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:58,915
I want people to know
that we weren't monsters.

588
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,798
I'm sorry I lied to you.

589
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,611
In my hand

590
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,144
I hold a recipe.

591
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,748
It's a recipe for distrust.

592
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:35,185
It's a recipe for fear.

593
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,723
It's a recipe for hatred.
You know what it is?

594
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:39,824
ALAN: What is it?

595
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,859
It's love.

596
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,328
"Simon,
there's no love on the plate.

597
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,798
"There's nothing but pens and papers.
There's no love there."

598
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,635
There will be.

599
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:52,637
'Cause we're each gonna
take a slip of this paper

600
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,998
and we're gonna write something
about the person next to us.

601
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,644
All right.

602
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:01,712
Can everybody write?
'Cause I didn't ask that.

603
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:05,983
You never know.
Just wanna make sure, right?

604
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:08,986
Which way do we go?
This way or this way?

605
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,656
I haven't decided that.

606
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:15,526
Evan, if we will just wait for
instructions, then we will find out

607
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,361
the way things are done
instead of jumping ahead.

608
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:19,530
That's good, Father Simon.

609
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,899
Here we are.
I know it's good because I said it.

610
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,003
All right. Everybody write
something loving and affirming.

611
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,938
I'm gonna join in, too.
I will write about

612
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,876
Brother Brian.

613
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:33,477
You will write
about Brother Frank.

614
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,779
Who will write
about Sister Tracy.

615
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,414
Who'll write
about Sister Veronica

616
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:37,682
who will write
about Brother Ben,

617
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:38,916
who will write
about Sister Ellen

618
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,250
who will write
about Brother Alan.

619
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,022
Time's almost up.

620
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,659
All right.

621
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,227
Let's begin.

622
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,765
Brother.

623
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,836
Read.

624
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,803
Stand and read
for us, would you?

625
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,776
"Brother Brian sings like a bird.
He also has nice eyes."

626
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:08,879
It's true.

627
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,947
MAN: Yes.

628
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:12,016
BRIAN: Thank you,
Father Simon.

629
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:15,752
"Brother Frank is the most
amazing kickball player."

630
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:19,722
Stand up.

631
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,961
(GIGGLES)

632
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:27,898
"Sister Tracy has the sweetest smile.
It lights up the whole place."

633
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,900
FATHER SIMON: How nice!

634
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:33,637
"You are helpful and handy.
I love your birdhouse."

635
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:35,305
TRACY: It's really pretty.

636
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:43,147
"Brother Ben, you are so loving
and kind, so considerate.

637
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:44,814
"I love you."

638
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,716
I love you, too.

639
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,789
"You are so warm
that when you finally came,

640
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,057
"our family felt complete."

641
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,528
Thank you.

642
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:01,165
"Brother Alan has
a beautiful smile."

643
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,199
And there's a smiley face.

644
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,641
"Brother Evan has nice eyes
and doesn't judge me."

645
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:18,983
EVAN: There it is.

646
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:20,917
Sister?

647
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,653
Father Simon.

648
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,660
"Father Simon,

649
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:32,829
"the most powerful man who
gives us strength and love."

650
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:37,201
I wish it were true,
but I'm not powerful at all.

651
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:39,202
I'm a very weak man.

652
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,405
But with love,

653
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,708
all things are possible.

654
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:47,445
And with love, we are strong.

655
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:50,046
And with love, we are family.

656
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,554
FATHER SIMON: <i>You know, when you
came in, you didn't smile much</i>

657
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:58,821
and now you smile a lot.

658
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,991
I know.

659
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,560
I'm glad to see it.

660
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:03,627
It's because of you,
Father Simon.

661
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,162
Thank you.

662
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:06,829
No. Thank you.

663
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,067
FATHER SIMON: Have you ever
thought about what you would say

664
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:13,471
if you could say something to

665
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,573
those who might be left behind
when you leave the earth?

666
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,208
Have you thought about it?
Yes, Father.

667
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:20,010
I guess everybody has.
I guess it's just human.

668
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,213
I know I have.

669
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:24,248
And I think the great
thing about our family

670
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:26,750
is we have
the opportunity to do it.

671
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,818
Because we're going
to a better place.

672
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:32,822
(SOBS)

673
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,260
It's hard.

674
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:40,329
Because I've always been taught
to keep my feelings in check.

675
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,069
But I feel free with you.

676
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,140
I've never been more welcomed

677
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:54,678
into a group of
strangers in my entire life.

678
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:59,683
<i>I was around people for over
20 years in my hometown that</i>

679
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,753
didn't give a damn
whether I lived or died.

680
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:05,822
I don't know that I've
done right by this world

681
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,826
and I think I could
do better in the next.

682
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,464
But I wanna please you.

683
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,102
I'm scared, nervous.

684
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:21,037
It's good,
it's a good scared-nervous.

685
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,477
It's not that hard, you just
gotta have the balls to do it.

686
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,683
I mean,
if you think you're happy

687
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:35,119
like with, with your family
and like, working your job

688
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,121
and like, going to school,
you're wrong.

689
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:39,290
You guys, you're all wrong.

690
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:41,224
And this is the best ever.

691
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:46,630
This family, this group,

692
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:49,098
has taken me in and
become my new family.

693
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,071
ELLEN: <i>I guess I don't really
know what I'm looking for,</i>

694
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,305
but I hope I find it here.

695
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,008
FATHER SIMON:
I hope so, too.

696
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,285
And when I

697
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:10,119
see my father

698
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,523
and show him who I've become,

699
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,794
I'm good now.

700
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,935
I don't know what else to say.

701
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,040
FATHER SIMON:
<i>It's a surprise for someone.</i>

702
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,109
It's a surprise for someone.

703
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,744
What's going on?

704
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:35,079
It's a surprise for someone.

705
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,915
What's going on?
What's going on?

706
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:41,384
GROUP: Happy birthday!

707
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,556
Yes!

708
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,729
FATHER SIMON:
Each one of these candles

709
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,564
represents someone in
your life who's hurt you,

710
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,368
someone who's let you down,

711
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:59,336
someone who's been mean to you,

712
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:01,938
someone outside of the family.

713
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,106
With all of your might

714
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,909
blow their lives away.

715
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,082
All dead!

716
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:52,923
MARY: Simon.

717
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:55,426
Not now, Mary.

718
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:57,159
FATHER SIMON:
So what's going on with you?

719
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,464
ALAN: Nothin'.

720
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:04,000
No, everything's good.

721
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:10,907
Now, just between you and me and the
camera, is anything bothering you?

722
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,278
You like being here?

723
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:17,147
Yeah. Yeah, I love it.

724
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:18,982
It's great.

725
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:22,119
Yeah, I really...
I really like it.

726
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,986
You making friends?
Yeah.

727
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,255
All the kids?
Yeah.

728
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,125
Yeah.

729
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:30,260
Friends with Grace and...

730
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:31,627
Ellen?
Yeah.

731
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,797
Evan?

732
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:35,097
Yeah.

733
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,068
Yeah.
Yeah.

734
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:43,440
<i>And then, I just went for it.</i>

735
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:44,875
You know, I just...

736
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:46,110
FATHER SIMON: What do you mean?
What'd you do?

737
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,045
Well, I kissed him.
Yeah.

738
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:49,379
And then I just
leaned in and kissed him.

739
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,181
Did he kiss you back?
Hmm?

740
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:52,648
Did he kiss you back?

741
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:12,503
Now.

742
00:46:12,504 --> 00:46:14,403

I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!

745
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,727
EVAN:
Do we have to film this?

746
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,566
Would it make you
more comfortable

747
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:18,001
if we turned
the camera to the wall?

748
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,102
If you wouldn't mind, Father?

749
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:40,823
(WOMEN CHATTING)

750
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:49,132
FATHER SIMON: <i>Now wait a minute.
I find this hard to believe.</i>

751
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:50,666
You never had a boyfriend?

752
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:54,804
(STAMMERS)

753
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,675
I mean,
I could be your boyfriend.

754
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,279
That'd be creepy.

755
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,747
Why?

756
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:10,119
Because you're my father.
You can't be both.

757
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,690
What if I told you
that I can do anything I want?

758
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,866
FATHER SIMON: Here we have two of
my children in an intimate moment.

759
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,607
What do you see in front of you?

760
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,348
ALAN: A girl.

761
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:39,616
FATHER SIMON: What's her name?

762
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:40,883
ALAN: Robin.

763
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:43,886
FATHER SIMON:
What's her purpose?

764
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,225
ALAN: I don't know.

765
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:51,094
FATHER SIMON: Her purpose is to serve
you, son, because you're a man.

766
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:52,362
Do you hear me?
Do you understand?

767
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:54,164
ALAN: Okay.

768
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:55,966
FATHER SIMON:
And at this moment,

769
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:58,568
you're looking at your
property and your playground.

770
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:02,039
A thing of beauty and delicacy.

771
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,473
Put your hands on
your property, son.

772
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:05,808
Do it.

773
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:07,644
Do it. Do it now.

774
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:08,712
ALAN: I don't know how.

775
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:09,778
Okay.

776
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,051
FATHER SIMON:
Is that the way you handle property?

777
00:49:14,052 --> 00:49:15,252
I don't know.

778
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:16,353
Touch her.

779
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:17,620
Higher.

780
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,623
Higher.

781
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:22,025
You know where to go.
Do it. Touch 'em.

782
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:23,193
Put your hand on the other one.

783
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:24,460
ALAN: Okay.

784
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:26,430
I'm sorry.

785
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:27,763
FATHER SIMON: Good. Just feel.

786
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:31,233
Robin, how does it feel?

787
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,936
Don't lie.

788
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:36,406
How does it feel?

789
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:37,907
It doesn't feel like anything.

790
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:39,977
I'm sorry.

791
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:44,715
Because Alan doesn't yet know
how to appreciate a woman.

792
00:49:44,716 --> 00:49:46,183
But he will.

793
00:49:46,184 --> 00:49:47,449
Kiss her.

794
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,486
Kiss her, Alan.

795
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:56,192
The other way, I can't see you.

796
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,894
Kiss her.

797
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:03,151
You're not kissing your goddamn
grandmother, kiss her.

798
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:17,514
ELLEN:
<i>Something's changed</i>

799
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,782
<i>and everyone's acting scared,</i>

800
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,653
<i>but they won't</i>
<i>tell me what's what.</i>

801
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:25,722
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>maybe they don't even know.</i>

802
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:28,657
<i>Things just...</i>
<i>They feel heavier.</i>

803
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,329
<i>Simon and Mary keep disappearing
for long hours at a time</i>

804
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:35,431
<i>and when they get back, they run
us through even crazier drills.</i>

805
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:38,300
(SHOUTING)

806
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:44,508
It's getting harder to focus.

807
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:46,709
<i>They're not</i>
<i>letting us sleep anymore.</i>

808
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,320
FATHER SIMON:
<i>I wanna talk now.</i>

809
00:50:57,321 --> 00:51:00,824
<i>I'd like to talk about music.</i>

810
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:03,292
<i>And the power that music
has to change people.</i>

811
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:06,895
Some people.

812
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,801
<i>The song</i> Amazing Grace,
<i>I've heard a million times.</i>

813
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:16,805
<i>I heard it growing up in church.</i>

814
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,778
I was a pretty bad kid.

815
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:23,779
I didn't listen to
that stuff, you know?

816
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:28,384
<i>Then one day that song came up</i>
<i>and it hit me</i>

817
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,520
square in the face.

818
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,693
I was in County, again,

819
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:39,663
<i>trying to lower my points,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

820
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:45,567
<i>Bullshit motherfucking
say-no-to-drugs meetings they had.</i>

821
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,406
God.

822
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:51,807
Sweet Jesus, it was boring.

823
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,112
You know the routine.

824
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:57,180
Some fat motherfucker gets up

825
00:51:57,181 --> 00:51:59,549
starts talking about how doing
blow made him suck dick.

826
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,017
Whatever. I don't give a shit.

827
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:17,567
<i>Then he starts</i>
<i>talkin' about that song.</i>

828
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:20,537
About how it changed him, you know.
He was blind but now he sees.

829
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:23,072
You know, blah, blah, blah,
I'm about half-listening.

830
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,510
<i>Then he starts to sing.</i>

831
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,680
<i>♪ Amazing Grace</i>

832
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,951
<i>♪ How sweet the sound ♪</i>

833
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,395
<i>He sung like an angel.</i>

834
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:46,895
<i>Just like an angel.</i>

835
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:51,801
So I figured

836
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:54,204
"Hell,

837
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:56,872

BRIAN:
<i>We were six when we first met.</i>

842
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,605
She was my best friend.

843
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:17,079
I think we knew even back then
we were gonna get married.

844
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,488
She got pregnant.

845
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,222
We were only 17.

846
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:28,991
But...

847
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,861
we weren't worried.

848
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,898
We knew we'd make it work.

849
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,670
She died.

850
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,073
FATHER SIMON:
What happened?

851
00:55:43,074 --> 00:55:45,574
The baby cut off
her blood supply.

852
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:47,976
What about the baby?

853
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:56,086
Why would anyone blame you?

854
00:55:56,087 --> 00:55:58,220
It's my fault she got pregnant.

855
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:02,858
And were they right?
Was it your fault?

856
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,097
You think it was lust or love?

857
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,136
It was love.

858
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:14,937
You sure you
know the difference?

859
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,641
Yes, Father.

860
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,678
What are you afraid of? Most?

861
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,847
Most of all?

862
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:27,983
Don't lie.

863
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,021
That I won't get
to see her again.

864
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:45,834
Good.

00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,308

866
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:58,080
Let's talk about Mama.

867
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,752
Mama didn't give
a shit about me.

868
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:07,891
Or what happened to me.

869
00:57:07,892 --> 00:57:11,094
So I got in trouble real early
and real often, you know.

870
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:14,497
<i>Petty theft, stole</i>
<i>some cars, shit like that.</i>

871
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:16,632
<i>And I got caught a lot.</i>

872
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,069
<i>She didn't do shit</i>
<i>to get me outta there.</i>

873
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,174
<i>So I stayed.</i>

874
00:57:24,175 --> 00:57:25,909
And I didn't care.

875
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:27,544
At least in there
the hot water worked.

876
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:29,311
You know,
I got something to eat.

877
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,149
God,
you see some things, though.

878
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:36,553
Back up, baby,
let me show you something.

879
00:57:36,554 --> 00:57:39,688
The first time I saw a man
take another man's life,

880
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:44,960
he stabbed him in
the eyeball for an orange.

881
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,963
<i>A fuckin' orange.</i>

882
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,899
I mean, fuck!

<i>There's always somebody who wants
to get fucked or fuck you.</i>

885
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:12,254
That's the only thing she ever
did say that made any sense.

886
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,993
<i>I wonder what</i>
<i>she'd think of me now.</i>

887
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,509
Fuck you, Mama!

888
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,842
Fuck you!

889
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:37,379
Turn it off.

<i>Just being in this world?</i>

891
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:44,254
<i>I'm here to tell you it
doesn't have to be that way.</i>

892
00:58:44,255 --> 00:58:47,155
You can call it what you will,
I call it a transition.

893
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,927
But it's a change,
brothers and sisters.

894
00:58:50,928 --> 00:58:52,461
It's a change.

895
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:55,363
And it's a hard way

896
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,569
and I can't make you choose it.

897
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,971
And if there's anyone
in this room right now

898
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:04,173
if there's anyone
under the sound of my voice

899
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:07,176
who feels that this
way is not for them,

900
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:09,779
I wish, I beg,

901
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:13,982
I plead for them to stand up
and walk out that door.

902
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,854
And I swear to you
upon my honor as a man

903
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:19,955
that you will not be stopped.

904
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:24,459
I will turn my
back and I will wait.

905
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,396
If you must leave, leave.

906
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:35,470
Very well.

907
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,875
Who's ready to feel that moment?

908
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:40,176
I am ready, Father.
I'm ready.

909
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:41,678
Who's ready to feel that power?

910
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:43,311
I'm ready, Father.

911
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:46,783
Brother Evan.
Yes?

912
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:48,784
He tells me it is your time.

913
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:51,887
Oh, my God.

914
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:00,929
Thank you, Father.

915
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,465
Celebrate with your brother.

916
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,604

<i>Exit interview, Brother Evan.</i>

918

EVAN: <i> Hi.</i>
<i>Hi, Brother.</i>

919
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:14,611
FATHER SIMON: This is a great
opportunity for you

920
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:18,781
to tell those who may
watch this in the future

921
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:22,117
what you're feeling,
what you'd like them to know.

922
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:31,995
This is it.

923
01:00:31,996 --> 01:00:36,331
<i>This is the only</i>
<i>holy place on earth.</i>

924
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:40,937
<i>I feel sad for you</i>

925
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:44,005
<i>because you will never experience
what we are experiencing.</i>

926
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,610
We only live once.

927
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,346
We only have one shot.

928
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,616
And this is it.

929
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,422
GROUP: <i> Yes, Father.</i>

01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:01,257
FATHER SIMON:
<i>This is a moment of joy</i>

931
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:04,193
for all of the family.

932
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:06,862
We will soon be
reunited in our new home.

933
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,104
Give me the camera.

934
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:20,609
Now, now.

FATHER SIMON: Perfect.

939
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:05,954
Absolutely perfect.

940
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:13,556
FATHER SIMON: Yesterday you saw
Brother Evan transition.

941
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:14,622
Yeah.

942
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,227
What was that like?

943
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:19,427
I don't know.

944
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:23,765
Yesterday,

945
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,237
I got to witness

946
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:32,707
the most beautiful thing I have
ever seen in my entire life.

947
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,145
I was really happy.

948
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:42,517
I knew that Brother Evan was

949
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,789
in a better place,
a place I wanted to be in.

950
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:53,328
Who's this guy?

951
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:58,501
The truck?
Yeah.

952
01:03:58,502 --> 01:03:59,768
Yeah.

953
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,505
You like trucks?
Yeah, I do.

954
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:04,473
I've always liked trucks.

955
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:06,574
Yeah. Yeah, they're strong.

956
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:11,212
Do you want to talk about
Brother Evan's transition?

957

(GRUNTS)

958
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:18,319
Why don't you just
tell us what it was like?

959
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:24,559
I don't know why,
I felt confused.

960
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,661
Confused about what?

961
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,266
I didn't want him to be in pain.

962
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,638
Don't you find
that hard to watch?

963
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,511
If it troubles you,
why didn't you stop it?

964
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,418
I've asked myself that
and I don't know why.

965
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,589
Should I have stopped it?

966
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,349
ELLEN: <i> I don't know what</i>
<i>I'm doing here anymore.</i>

967
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,768
<i>He was right.</i>

968
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,141
She was alone.

969
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,413
And I was too busy all the time.

(SOBS)

971
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,488
<i>I didn't listen to her.</i>

972
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:31,227
<i>Not at all.</i>

973
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:33,428
<i>She would try and tell me things</i>

974
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,801
and I know it's too
late for her, but...

975
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,775
<i>I decided to</i>
<i>stay and help Leach.</i>

976
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,815
If he made her feel better,
maybe he'll do the same for me.

01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:16,771
I'm ready.

980
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:19,607
You sure?

981
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,776
Yes, Father.

982
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,181
I wanna feel what she felt.

983
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,851
You're unhappy, aren't you?

984
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,298
FATHER SIMON: This is a
special night, my children.

985

GROUP: Yes, Father.

986
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:47,370
FATHER SIMON: Our last member

987
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:51,507
has expelled the fear in her
heart and she shall join us.

988
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:52,707
GROUP: Yes, Father.

989
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:01,849
Are you ready to join us?

990
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:04,819
Yes, Father.

991
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,561
(SCREAMING)

992
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,715
FATHER SIMON:
<i>Can I share a story with you?</i>

993
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,774
So I'm 18 years old, right?

994
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,377
And I get a girl pregnant.

995
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,784
And it's complicated by the
fact that we're in love.

996
01:07:34,785 --> 01:07:37,386
And her mama didn't like it,
and my mama didn't like it

997
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:41,323
so we were cast out
on our own, you know.

998
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:44,794
I took a job at the burger joint,
mowed lawns on the weekends.

999
01:07:44,795 --> 01:07:49,397
A few months go by, she goes into
labor and she loses the baby.

1000
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,734
And I lose her.

1001
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:57,673
They had to cut her open
and bled too much.

1002
01:07:57,674 --> 01:07:59,341
There was nothing
they could do, you know.

1003
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:00,775
It was over real quick.

1004
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:05,381
So what do you do

1005
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:07,516
when the worst thing,

1006
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:11,587
the worst thing you can possibly
imagine, actually happens?

1007
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:12,987
What do you do?

1008
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:51,494
We're always going through life
and we're just getting by.

1009
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:56,731
<i>And doing what they're told to do,
but you don't have to do that.</i>

1010
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:02,770
You can do what you want
and you can be happy.

1011
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:16,152
Is everyone ready for
our next transition?

1012
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:17,752
GROUP: Yes, Father.

FATHER SIMON: You've done all
that you can so far.

1019
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:40,809
You've purged
the poison from your soul.

1020
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:43,378
He knows that
you're here to serve him.

1021
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,915
He doesn't want to lose you
to the other side.

1022
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:53,355
He knows the pain
that you've suffered.

1023
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:55,890
It's time to take the first
step toward forgiveness.

1024
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:59,962
Are you ready
for your moment of revelation?

1025

I'm just scared.

1053
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:11,085
And all that
I've asked in return

1054
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,822
is that you have
a little faith in me.

pierced my soul.

She lost her transition

1082

When I was a kid,

1083
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:01,489
I found this puppy.

1084

But my timing was off.

1085
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:13,569
See, Mama was bad to drink, she
wasn't studying no puppy that day.

1086
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:17,306
Mama was studying teaching me
how to tie my shoes.

1087
01:16:17,307 --> 01:16:20,876
I'd been trying it maybe six
months, but I couldn't get it.

1088

No matter how I tried,
I couldn't get it.

She took Phil and she

1090
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:29,250
hung him outside the window.

1091
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:32,286
She told me I had 30 seconds.

1092
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:35,790

1093
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:37,958

1096
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:50,371
It was mine.

Yes, Father.

01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:34,268
Have you thought
about your own moment?

1117
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,405
I just...

1118
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:42,210
I just think
about the better place

1119
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:44,178

the transition to you.

1120

could you be more perfect?

1123
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:58,625
I know you won't understand.

1124

I want you to know
it's not your fault.

1127

But you never could have made
me as happy as I am now.

1128
