4
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:38,962
Dear Mom,
Get well soon.

5
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,056
- Tell the head nurse to stand by.
- Yes.

6
00:00:56,648 --> 00:01:04,905
Ryoko.

7
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,704
Hello.

8
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,229
I'm so sorry.

9
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:43,402
5:28 p.m.

10
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:33,869
I brought this for Mom.

11
00:03:23,252 --> 00:03:27,297
Seven years later

12
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,428
Hey!

13
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:36,306
Let's go home.
The waves are too high.

14
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:43,397
Dad!

15
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:45,565
No luck again?

16
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,150
You don't understand.

17
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,487
I'm only after the big ones.

18
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:56,660
I prefer real-life girls
to imaginary big fish.

19
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,286
Well...

20
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:01,623
When you grow up
you'll understand.

21
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,583
It's called being romantic.

22
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:10,549
Hello?

23
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:13,510
Yes. The proposal is ready.

24
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,762
I'll bring it tomorrow.

25
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:17,264
Yes.

26
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:18,723
Hello?

27
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:23,145
I gotta go. See you tomorrow.

28
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,123
This is too big for us.

29
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:45,167
We'll share it with Rie.

30
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:58,013
You haven't brought friends home lately.
Is everything okay?

31
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:01,933
Did you know all
black sea bream are born male?

32
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:03,560
What?

33
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:07,522
When they reach 15cm long,
they become hermaphrodites.

34
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:10,942
Then some become female.

35
00:05:11,152 --> 00:05:12,319
I see.

36
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:15,947
What about this one?

37
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,535
Didn't you see the ovaries
when we cut it?

38
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:24,080
That's right.

39
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,585
I don't know much about ovaries.

40
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:33,798
Have you been feeling down
or something recently?

41
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:36,426
Why?

42
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,346
You look dispirited.

43
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:46,186
Gang.

44
00:05:58,074 --> 00:05:59,533
Hey, Dad...

45
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,161
why don't you get remarried?

46
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:08,208
Why do you say that?

47
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:11,503
I just think you should.

48
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,276
Thanks for dinner.

49
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,789
It's your turn to wash the dishes.

50
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:24,409
Well...

51
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:28,204
It's like a ceremony for worshippers.

52
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:32,000
They're pretty much the same...
lonely people.

53
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:36,671
Happy people wouldn’t go
to that kind of concert.

54
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:40,008
All Japanese are lonely.

55
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,597
Are you?

56
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,101
You too?

57
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:56,274
Boss.

58
00:07:56,484 --> 00:08:00,528
Ueno wants to change
tomorrow's meeting from 1:00 to 3:30.

59
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:01,780
Okay.

60
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:04,240
It doesn't matter to me.
I'll be here.

61
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,286
I'll drop in at Starts,
then meet Yoshikawa tonight.

62
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:10,121
I won't be back at the office.

63
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:13,750
If there are any changes,
I'll call you on your cell phone, then.

64
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,126
Okay.

65
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,305
- Excuse me.
- What?

66
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:32,811
I'm going to get married soon.

67
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,066
Really?

68
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:40,110
Congratulations.

69
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:43,446
To whom?

70
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:47,200
Someone you don't know.

71
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:53,289
Anyway, congratulations.

72
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,061
You're a busy man!

73
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:20,775
It's been all right,
but the profit margins are shrinking.

74
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:24,279
- How about you?
- Well...

75
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:26,156
Didn't you know?

76
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,784
The movie industry
is recession-proof.

77
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:31,536
- Really?
- I'm lying.

78
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:39,043
It's a survival game,
or a test of endurance.

79
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:40,628
What's your outlook?

80
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:43,298
Seems like there is
a bright future ahead.

81
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:46,384
But I don't know
how long we should wait.

82
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,721
Yoshikawa...

83
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,891
didn't you say the same thing
a year ago?

84
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,476
Did I?

85
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:02,901
Awful girls.

86
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:06,196
No class and stuck up.

87
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,573
Stupid as well.

88
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:11,367
Where are all the attractive girls?

89
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:18,291
Japan is finished.
Give me another one.

90
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,169
Well...

91
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:26,424
I'm thinking about getting remarried.

92
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:30,970
What made you decide to do that?

93
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,557
- To whom?
- I haven't got a girl yet.

94
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:37,477
My son told me...

95
00:10:37,686 --> 00:10:41,231
that I looked dispirited
and I should get remarried.

96
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,025
That's the story.

97
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:46,653
Look dispirited, huh?

98
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:52,700
So, how are you going to look for one?
An arranged marriage?

99
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,622
No, that's not my style.

100
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,254
I wish there was a very nice woman
hiding somewhere.

101
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:13,137
What kind of girl are you looking for?
Preferably young?

102
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:18,560
Not too young.

103
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:21,396
Possibly she has a job

104
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:24,357
and has some skills.

105
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,192
Skills?

106
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:29,904
For example,
playing the piano, singing,

107
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:32,699
or Japanese dance.

108
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:36,661
Your wife Ryoko was like that.

109
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:46,129
I believe that confidence comes
only from having decent skills.

110
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,840
Lack of confidence
makes you dependent on someone,

111
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:51,467
and that brings unhappiness.

112
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:55,263
Pianist, huh?

113
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:57,557
lt'll cost you a lot.

114
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:01,603
She doesn't have to be
a successful professional.

115
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:05,815
I don't want to fail
at marriage at my age.

116
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:10,361
I'd like to have enough time
to get to know her.

117
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:13,156
I want to meet
as many girls as possible

118
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,909
and choose my ideal one.

119
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:20,705
What are you laughing at?

120
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:26,127
Am I expecting too much?

121
00:12:26,337 --> 00:12:27,629
I probably am.

122
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:30,340
No. Just leave it to me.

123
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,425
I have a good idea.

124
00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:36,888
Conduct an audition.

125
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,850
"Looking for Love"

126
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,602
lt'll be a romantic story.

127
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:45,355
Remember the documentary
we made before?

128
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:50,318
It was about a former dancer,
a patron, and an autistic boy.

129
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:55,073
The one where we teamed up
with the German TV station?

130
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:57,158
It's based on the story.

131
00:12:57,368 --> 00:12:58,743
Any problems?

132
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:01,829
Well... but...

133
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,164
Well...

134
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:06,042
Are we really going
to hold an audition?

135
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,336
Trust me.

136
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:12,006
Have I ever disappointed you?

137
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:13,299
But...

138
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:16,886
The heroine is supposed to be
in her early 20s to early 30s.

139
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,181
One of the requirements is
that she is skillful at something.

140
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:21,516
Any objections?

141
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:25,395
But don't you think
that would be fraudulent?

142
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,773
This audition is not only
for finding you a wife.

143
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:31,025
It's part of making a movie.

144
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:33,319
If we can find funding,
we can make the movie.

145
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:36,656
The story isn't bad.

146
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:38,700
Well...

147
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:44,539
Am I going to marry
the lead girl of this movie?

148
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:45,873
No.

149
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,210
Any girl who could get the lead
wouldn’t marry you.

150
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,879
They aren't the marrying type.

151
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:55,299
Really good ones pass
the preliminary screening

152
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:58,052
and fail the second screening.

153
00:13:58,262 --> 00:13:59,512
Really?

154
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:04,225
Those are about 10
of the 1,000 applicants.

155
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:08,062
They are quite attractive.

156
00:14:08,272 --> 00:14:10,523
Smart and well-bred.

157
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:14,235
Obedient and well-trained.

158
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:17,321
The kind you'd want
your son to marry.

159
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:19,699
I don't get it.

160
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:23,411
Why can't she get the lead, then?

161
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,330
Because she won't be unhappy.

162
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,501
Unhappy people can act well.

163
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:34,422
One more thing.

164
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:38,217
I have a plan to work
with an FM station, so I'll combine this.

165
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:42,138
It's a program called
Tomorrow's Heroine.

166
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:46,434
Trust me.

167
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:48,978
I am a pro at auditions.

168
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:53,608
This is Yoshikawa.

169
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:55,610
I'm in room number two.

170
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:57,445
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

171
00:14:57,654 --> 00:14:59,697
Is coffee okay for you?

172
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:01,657
Bring two coffees, please.

173
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:06,871
I'm in a middle of a traffic jam.
I might be late...

174
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,295
Can you hand that tape
to Mr. Kaneda? Yes.

175
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:16,714
Okay. Thanks.

176
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:27,350
Tomorrow's heroine,

177
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,311
I'm just wondering
where you are now.

178
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:33,815
Sometimes
unbelievable things do happen.

179
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:37,652
All you need to do
is gather your courage.

180
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:41,239
Every star has her defining moment,

181
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:44,158
even Hepburn and Julia Roberts.

182
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:48,329
They lived normal lives
before they became stars.

183
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:53,793
Tomorrow's heroines
are living just like you.

184
00:15:55,546 --> 00:16:01,092
Tomorrow's heroine could be you.

185
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:11,936
I'm home.

186
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:21,571
- You're home early today.
- Yeah.

187
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,907
I have to work at home tonight.

188
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,201
Please heat up your dinner.

189
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:29,704
The bigger dish is for Shigehiko.

190
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:31,205
Okay.

191
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:33,374
I'll see you on Monday, then.

192
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:36,043
My daughter's going to visit me
with her children.

193
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:37,753
I have to go shopping.

194
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,214
- That's exciting.
- Hey, Gang.

195
00:16:40,424 --> 00:16:42,216
Please put the laundry
in the hamper.

196
00:16:42,426 --> 00:16:45,344
- I got to go.
- Okay.

197
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:47,847
- Thanks.
- Bye.

198
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:44,672
Hello. This is Aoyama.

199
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:46,215
It's me.

200
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:50,219
Oh, Yoshikawa.
I'm checking out the applications.

201
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,388
They're all good, aren't they?

202
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,098
Right.

203
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:57,018
I don't know what to do.

204
00:18:57,227 --> 00:19:00,271
It's like buying my first car.

205
00:19:01,732 --> 00:19:04,608
Don't confuse your car with your wife.

206
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:07,194
I'd like to have the audition
late next week.

207
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:09,322
Can you choose about 30 applicants?

208
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:11,991
Thirty applicants?

209
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,410
Okay. I'll let you know.

210
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:17,538
And... don't trust pictures.

211
00:19:17,748 --> 00:19:19,623
An essay can be more useful.

212
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,917
- Okay. I got it.
- Bye.

213
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,669
Bye.

214
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:30,676
Choose 30, huh?

215
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:36,891
Oh, you're here.

216
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,560
Why don't you knock?

217
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,270
Did you just come home?

218
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,064
Are you ready for dinner?

219
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:46,233
I'll eat later.
Why don't you eat now?

220
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:47,943
Okay.

221
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,612
Well...

222
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,822
I have a friend of mine here.

223
00:19:53,116 --> 00:19:55,076
A girl?

224
00:19:55,285 --> 00:19:57,745
You guys can eat mine too.

225
00:19:57,954 --> 00:19:59,330
Thanks.

226
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:35,616
Asami Yamazaki.

227
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:49,046
Piano, classical ballet for 12 years.

228
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,391
"I'm not sure
I can become an actress,

229
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,686
"and you probably won't choose me.

230
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,897
"I'm simply attracted to this story.

231
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:11,193
"I studied ballet for a long time,

232
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,738
"then damaged my hips
when I was 18.

233
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:17,867
"It happened when I was planning
to study ballet in London.

234
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,453
"I was devastated.

235
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:23,456
"Ballet was my top priority,

236
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:25,749
"so my dream died.

237
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,003
"It might sound like I'm exaggerating,

238
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:32,423
"but it's like accepting death.

239
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:36,886
"Living is another way of
reaching death.

240
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,431
"I think I know these things very well.

241
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,934
That's why I want
to audition for the role."

242
00:22:01,244 --> 00:22:02,870
When did this dinosaur live?

243
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:05,372
The latter part
of the Cretaceous period.

244
00:22:05,582 --> 00:22:08,459
The latter part of
the Cretaceous period means...

245
00:22:08,668 --> 00:22:10,294
Well...

246
00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:13,881
That's the period
for the parasaurolophus.

247
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,424
Good.

248
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,177
What about the dinosaur
that has a Syracuse model?

249
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:20,054
- I don't know.
- Do you want to see it?

250
00:22:20,263 --> 00:22:21,680
Yes, I do.

251
00:22:31,107 --> 00:22:34,485
- Hi! Good evening.
- Good evening.

252
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:36,320
I am his father.

253
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:38,989
Nice to meet you.

254
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:42,076
- My name is Misuzu Takagi.
- Nice to meet you.

255
00:22:42,285 --> 00:22:44,078
I often see her on the train.

256
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:47,081
I thought she was pretty.
Then I tried to talk to her.

257
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,832
Good job.

258
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,628
Since I'm interested in biology too,

259
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:55,673
- I wanted to see his books.
- I see.

260
00:22:55,882 --> 00:22:57,591
- We ate your dinner.
- Fine.

261
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:00,678
What? Was that his?

262
00:23:00,887 --> 00:23:03,889
What should I do? I ate it.

263
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:05,266
I'm sorry.

264
00:23:05,475 --> 00:23:07,226
I can cook something for you.

265
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:09,270
Don't worry about it.

266
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:11,146
Take it easy.

267
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,773
Thank you.

268
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:18,821
Gang.

269
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:23,909
Come here.

270
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:26,662
Good boy. Let's go for a walk.

271
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:29,957
Shigehiko, make sure
she gets home all right.

272
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,292
Of course.

273
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:32,876
Come on, Gang.

274
00:23:38,258 --> 00:23:39,675
Let's go.

275
00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:57,484
Ready?

276
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:02,656
You know, I feel like a criminal.

277
00:24:03,783 --> 00:24:05,159
I'm ready.

278
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:08,871
Let's start.

279
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:12,541
Pleased to meet you.

280
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,336
Please sit.

281
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,762
My name is Yu Tanaka.
Nice to meet you.

282
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:26,847
Please have a seat.

283
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:30,184
- Are you nervous?
- Yes. A little bit.

284
00:24:30,393 --> 00:24:33,020
- Sorry you're the first.
- That's okay.

285
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:35,731
We're going to film this,
but just be natural.

286
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,317
Do you mind if I ask
what your father does?

287
00:24:38,526 --> 00:24:41,945
My father's job is... well...

288
00:24:42,155 --> 00:24:44,114
What can I say?

289
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:46,325
Next one.

290
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,745
- I'm going to ask you frankly.
- Yes.

291
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:52,623
What made you decide
to audition for this role?

292
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:55,417
Have you ever had sex
with someone you didn't like?

293
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,252
Are you interested in drugs?

294
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:58,712
Did you play any interesting roles?

295
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:01,131
Can you act a little bit for us?

296
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:03,801
- Sure.
- Go ahead.

297
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:10,808
What kind of music do you like?

298
00:25:11,017 --> 00:25:14,186
- Which actresses do you like?
- I like Mitsuko Mori.

299
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:15,145
Next.

300
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:22,111
I used to like sports.

301
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,530
In high school, I played...

302
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:27,116
Have you thought about working
in the sex industry?

303
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:31,829
I have a friend who is working
in the industry, however...

304
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,622
Next.

305
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:45,467
How do you view men?

306
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,553
Have you ever seen
any Tarkovsky movies?

307
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:49,304
Ren Osugi.

308
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:53,767
There are some sex scenes.
Can you handle that?

309
00:25:53,977 --> 00:25:55,894
No problem.

310
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:57,980
Do you have a sixth sense?

311
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:09,199
Okay. Next.

312
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:11,160
May I ask you a question?

313
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,995
Can you smile?

314
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,457
What kind of men do you not like?

315
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:19,418
I'm Yoko Sugimura.
Nice to meet you.

316
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:24,381
If I didn't have confidence,
I wouldn’t be an actress.

317
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,425
Excuse me.

318
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:34,641
When I was two, my mother decided
that I would be an actress.

319
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:38,061
Can you walk around the chair?

320
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:40,689
Turn around.

321
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,191
Next, please.

322
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,574
It was nice meeting you.

323
00:26:54,537 --> 00:26:59,208
It's time for a break,
according to our schedule.

324
00:27:00,835 --> 00:27:02,878
We're 30 minutes behind.

325
00:27:03,087 --> 00:27:05,589
- Let's take a 10-minute break.
- Sure.

326
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:16,058
Why are you making me
ask all these questions?

327
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,228
Don't tell me you're
not interested anymore.

328
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:22,439
It's not like that.

329
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:25,484
Then what?

330
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,446
I'm kind of nervous.

331
00:27:29,656 --> 00:27:31,406
I gotta go to the restroom.

332
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:57,266
I lived in Paris for three years.

333
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:01,103
Then I came back to Tokyo,
and I was working as a designer.

334
00:28:01,855 --> 00:28:03,897
I can't think about anything else
except being an actress.

335
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:06,733
I realized my agent
specialized in porn.

336
00:28:06,943 --> 00:28:08,861
Can you keep this one
for another job?

337
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,823
I'm not satisfied with
just being called a cover girl.

338
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:22,082
This scar is from the first attempt,
and this one is from the second.

339
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:25,002
I was sent to a mental hospital
three times.

340
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:28,171
Next one.

341
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:31,008
Emi Kitani. Nice to meet you.

342
00:28:31,217 --> 00:28:34,344
Didn't we finish your interview?

343
00:28:34,554 --> 00:28:37,681
Right. But I haven't finished
what I have to say.

344
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:41,435
You have a great career.
Why do you want to audition for this role?

345
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:45,856
Well... It's so difficult for me, and...

346
00:28:46,065 --> 00:28:47,524
I tried hard, but...

347
00:28:48,651 --> 00:28:50,319
I'm sorry.

348
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,446
I am a pediatric nurse.

349
00:28:52,655 --> 00:28:54,364
My work is very tough, but...

350
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,618
Next, please.

351
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,038
The next one is Asami Yamazaki.

352
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:05,292
Please.

353
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:22,392
- Asami Yamazaki.
- Have a seat.

354
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:27,564
Sorry for the delay.

355
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,362
Have you done any movies or TV jobs?

356
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:37,991
There were some opportunities,
but they all fell through.

357
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:42,579
Do you belong to any agency?

358
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:44,039
Not really.

359
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:48,919
A guy from a record company
is supposed to represent me,

360
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:51,672
but we haven't contacted
each other for a long time.

361
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:53,590
Which record company?

362
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,676
Ace Records.

363
00:29:57,553 --> 00:30:01,473
Could you tell me his name?

364
00:30:01,683 --> 00:30:04,851
Director Shibata,
in the Japanese music department.

365
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:15,946
It says you've been unemployed
since you quit your previous job.

366
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:18,073
How do you manage
your daily expenses?

367
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:20,534
If you don't mind, can you tell us?

368
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,205
I work at my friend's place
three times a week.

369
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:27,165
What kind of place?

370
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,876
It's a small bar located in Ginza.

371
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:35,882
The owner used to be my classmate
in a voice training class.

372
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:39,636
If I keep my expenses low,
I have no money problems.

373
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:43,015
Don't you want
to live a luxurious life?

374
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:47,394
Being too poor isn't good.

375
00:30:47,603 --> 00:30:51,189
But if I can afford books and CDs,

376
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:53,483
I'm pretty happy.

377
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,029
May I ask you about ballet?

378
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,322
Certainly.

379
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:02,701
- You damaged your hips.
- That's correct.

380
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:07,122
It must've been awful to quit
what you had been doing.

381
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,000
Yes.

382
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,713
I must sound a bit rude, but...

383
00:31:14,922 --> 00:31:20,093
Your essay says
that your dream died,

384
00:31:20,303 --> 00:31:24,973
and it was like accepting death.

385
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:28,685
I was highly impressed.

386
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:33,940
I think everyone
has similar experiences.

387
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:38,779
There is always something
beyond our control in our lives.

388
00:31:38,988 --> 00:31:43,116
You just have to accept it.

389
00:31:43,326 --> 00:31:46,578
I think that's life.

390
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:49,122
I mean...

391
00:31:49,332 --> 00:31:54,086
I was amazed a young girl
like you understands that.

392
00:31:54,295 --> 00:31:58,298
I think you've been taking
your life very seriously.

393
00:31:58,508 --> 00:32:01,968
That's what I thought.

394
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,067
Thank you very much.

395
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,576
Are you finished?

396
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:34,000
Thank you. We may contact you later.

397
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,460
Yes.

398
00:32:38,172 --> 00:32:39,756
Excuse me.

399
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,229
May I call the next one?

400
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:57,274
- Let's have a 15-minute break.
- Fine.

401
00:32:57,483 --> 00:33:00,819
Please call Mr. Ito
and tell him I will be late.

402
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:11,454
What do you think about her?

403
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:13,832
She made me very nervous.

404
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:16,126
She made me want
to smoke a cigarette.

405
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:21,590
You knew you would like her
before the audition.

406
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,968
I've been thinking about her
since I read her essay.

407
00:33:25,178 --> 00:33:27,888
I like her much more
after meeting her in person.

408
00:33:28,097 --> 00:33:31,600
You said, "I think you've been
taking your life seriously."

409
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,395
That's not a comment an interviewer
says in an audition. I was stunned.

410
00:33:35,605 --> 00:33:39,524
Don’t joke about that.
She really impressed me.

411
00:33:45,114 --> 00:33:49,534
I'm sure she's a serious girl.

412
00:33:49,744 --> 00:33:52,037
She looks better than her photo,

413
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:54,748
and may also be goodhearted.

414
00:33:57,877 --> 00:34:00,462
But there's something
I don't like about her.

415
00:34:01,714 --> 00:34:03,131
What?

416
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:06,593
I don't know what it is.

417
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,679
I can't explain exactly what's wrong.

418
00:34:10,806 --> 00:34:12,307
Something bothers me.

419
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:37,165
The girl you brought
the other night looked nice.

420
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,875
Misuzu?

421
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:41,795
- She looks nice, but...
- What?

422
00:34:42,922 --> 00:34:44,756
One of those girl things.

423
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:48,468
- I don't understand girls.
- Come on.

424
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:54,015
Thanks.

425
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,101
Hey, Dad, about your remarriage.

426
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:01,481
Preferably someone
who cooks better than Rie does.

427
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,403
Why are you in such a hurry?

428
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:10,490
Another dinosaur was discovered
at Moon Valley in Argentina.

429
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,660
That one could be older than eoraptor.

430
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:16,830
- Really?
- I'll be busy collecting information.

431
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:20,750
Take a bath.

432
00:35:56,162 --> 00:35:58,705
Yes, hello.

433
00:35:58,914 --> 00:36:01,249
Sorry for calling so late.

434
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:06,171
This is Aoyama, one of the producers
who interviewed you today.

435
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,549
Thank you for your time today.

436
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:11,384
Not at all.

437
00:36:11,594 --> 00:36:13,053
Well...

438
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,350
I would like to talk to you more.

439
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:21,102
I wonder if you might have some time.

440
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:24,189
Of course. I'd love to see you.

441
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:27,150
What time would be good for you?

442
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,862
Anytime during the day
would be fine.

443
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:35,450
Really. Let me see.
How about...

444
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,499
Good night.

445
00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:59,516
This is Aoyama.

446
00:36:59,725 --> 00:37:01,393
It's me.

447
00:37:01,602 --> 00:37:03,144
What's up?

448
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,271
Well...

449
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,274
Regarding the girl, Yamasaki?

450
00:37:08,484 --> 00:37:12,821
I called Ace Records
just to make sure.

451
00:37:14,657 --> 00:37:16,533
It's not a big deal.

452
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,120
But something didn't seem right.

453
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:22,539
- What is it?
- Well...

454
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:27,919
There is no Director Shibata
in the Japanese music department.

455
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:31,714
To be precise,
he isn't there anymore.

456
00:37:34,593 --> 00:37:37,470
This guy, Shibata...

457
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,265
has been missing
for a year and a half.

458
00:37:42,852 --> 00:37:44,769
He just disappeared.

459
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:53,611
I'm nervous.

460
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:58,741
I won't ask you
any special questions,

461
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:01,161
so please relax.

462
00:38:02,746 --> 00:38:08,209
Do you only want me to enjoy
this nice food and talk to you?

463
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,211
That's correct.

464
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,923
That's the best request
I've ever had.

465
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:18,511
Just one question.

466
00:38:19,722 --> 00:38:23,391
The guy from the record company.

467
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,519
Mr. Shibata?

468
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:29,564
I'm sorry.

469
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:32,317
I said so at the audition,

470
00:38:32,526 --> 00:38:36,321
but, in fact, I've never met him.

471
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:41,326
I was advised to say so,

472
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:44,996
since it would be too difficult
without an agency.

473
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:49,709
I see.

474
00:38:50,836 --> 00:38:52,545
I didn't mean to lie.

475
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:54,839
It's okay.
I've clarified that question.

476
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:57,842
That means there is no problem.

477
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,180
Here is your food.

478
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,934
It looks delicious.

479
00:39:11,357 --> 00:39:12,649
Go ahead.

480
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,122
Delicious.

481
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,166
Good.

482
00:39:34,964 --> 00:39:41,094
I hope I'm not asking
too much of you...

483
00:39:42,304 --> 00:39:45,723
but if you have some free time,

484
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:49,102
I'd like to talk to you more.

485
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:51,938
That would be wonderful.

486
00:39:52,147 --> 00:39:57,193
I don't have any adult men
to be frank with.

487
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,655
If I'm good enough, I'd love to.

488
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:03,074
Really?

489
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:05,285
I'm very happy about that.

490
00:40:05,494 --> 00:40:07,704
I'll try not to bother you.

491
00:40:08,622 --> 00:40:11,833
Anywhere is fine.

492
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,918
Even just on the telephone
would be fine.

493
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,132
I wrote down my cell phone number
on the business card I gave you.

494
00:40:19,341 --> 00:40:22,010
Please call me anytime.

495
00:40:23,137 --> 00:40:26,889
Thank you very much.
Thanks for the meal too.

496
00:40:29,518 --> 00:40:32,520
I've decided.

497
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,982
I don't care about the movie.

498
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:38,735
I'm interested only in her.

499
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:46,492
Don't worry about the movie.
I'll handle that.

500
00:40:46,702 --> 00:40:48,411
I'm not worried about that.

501
00:40:49,705 --> 00:40:51,956
But don't be too hasty.

502
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:56,294
You said you wanted to have
enough time to get to know her.

503
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:01,924
Why are you so negative about her?
What's wrong with her?

504
00:41:02,134 --> 00:41:06,596
I only think that life isn't so easy.

505
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:12,935
She's beautiful, classy, and obedient.

506
00:41:13,145 --> 00:41:15,730
And she doesn't have any boyfriends.

507
00:41:15,939 --> 00:41:19,734
And she fell into our trap.
Isn't it too good to be true?

508
00:41:20,944 --> 00:41:24,572
I checked her references,
but none are accessible.

509
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,827
The bar she said she was working at
is also unknown.

510
00:41:30,954 --> 00:41:35,917
We can't reach anybody
who knows her.

511
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,044
I wasn't born yesterday.

512
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:40,546
I won't be fooled this easily.

513
00:41:40,756 --> 00:41:44,550
I trust myself
more than the opinions of others.

514
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,805
If there's any trouble,
I will handle it.

515
00:41:50,182 --> 00:41:51,599
Right.

516
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:56,646
As you said before, I found
my ideal woman from an audition.

517
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,774
I appreciate it, Yoshikawa.

518
00:42:04,988 --> 00:42:06,447
Hey, Aoyama.

519
00:42:07,574 --> 00:42:09,701
Promise me one thing.

520
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,786
Don't call her for a while.

521
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:15,248
I hope I'm wrong.

522
00:42:15,457 --> 00:42:18,084
It's going to affect your whole life.

523
00:42:18,293 --> 00:42:20,336
You had better not be hasty.

524
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,552
Cool down a bit.

525
00:42:32,975 --> 00:42:35,977
All right. I promise you.

526
00:43:45,172 --> 00:43:46,798
You're not sick, are you?

527
00:43:48,467 --> 00:43:51,594
It's rare for you to take a day off.

528
00:43:51,804 --> 00:43:54,722
This is the first time
since I started working for you.

529
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:57,642
Oh, well...

530
00:43:57,851 --> 00:44:00,686
It's good to have a break.

531
00:44:00,896 --> 00:44:03,356
You might be a little tired.

532
00:44:03,565 --> 00:44:08,361
Since your wife passed away,
you've raised your son by yourself.

533
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:11,697
You started your own company,
which is doing quite well.

534
00:44:11,907 --> 00:44:14,450
You've been working too hard.

535
00:44:16,245 --> 00:44:19,747
I wish my husband was like you.

536
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,124
My life would be easier.

537
00:44:26,255 --> 00:44:28,756
You must have a nice girlfriend.

538
00:44:48,861 --> 00:44:51,195
I'm sure you do.

539
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:56,242
A man can't function
without a woman's help.

540
00:45:38,285 --> 00:45:41,162
I'm done. I'm going home now.

541
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:45,291
Bye.

542
00:46:01,642 --> 00:46:03,392
I'm leaving.

543
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,729
See you.

544
00:46:14,446 --> 00:46:17,239
What? Do you have
anything to tell me?

545
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:20,284
Not really. See you tomorrow.

546
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,954
Bye.

547
00:48:17,486 --> 00:48:19,070
This is Aoyama.

548
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:22,823
Really? Good.

549
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:25,910
I thought you
wouldn't call me anymore.

550
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:32,333
You might think I'm desperate
if I tell you this...

551
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:37,004
but I was longing for your call.

552
00:48:38,757 --> 00:48:40,382
I'm sorry.

553
00:48:41,593 --> 00:48:44,095
So, how are you?

554
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,890
What?

555
00:48:49,017 --> 00:48:51,352
What's so funny?

556
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:56,941
I didn't think I would see you again,
so I'm pretty excited.

557
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,282
Here's your drink.

558
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:28,305
I didn't ask you about your family
at the audition.

559
00:49:28,515 --> 00:49:30,307
Are they fine?

560
00:49:30,517 --> 00:49:32,143
Yes. They're fine.

561
00:49:32,352 --> 00:49:34,311
You're from Tokyo, right?

562
00:49:34,521 --> 00:49:38,190
They moved to Chiba last month.

563
00:49:39,317 --> 00:49:42,736
My father loves golfing, and living
in Chiba is more convenient.

564
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:46,323
- I see.
- We're not that close,

565
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:49,243
but not that distant either...
quite an average family.

566
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:53,080
Do you still work at the bar?

567
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,916
- Yes.
- Is that in Ginza?

568
00:49:56,126 --> 00:50:00,045
The Stone Fish on 4th Street.
Isn't it a funny name?

569
00:50:00,255 --> 00:50:03,174
The Stone Fish?
Shall I come for a drink?

570
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:07,094
I would love to have you come over,
but my boss tries to...

571
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:10,097
interfere with my private life.
She is a good person, though.

572
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:14,935
If you don't want me to come,
of course I won't.

573
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:17,688
I just want to know you better.

574
00:50:17,898 --> 00:50:22,735
I won't lie to you. Definitely not.

575
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:24,320
I promise.

576
00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:25,738
I have to tell you this...

577
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,952
It's about the movie.

578
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:35,039
Did someone else get the part?

579
00:50:35,248 --> 00:50:38,542
It's not like that.
The movie...

580
00:50:42,714 --> 00:50:46,800
Actually, the sponsor
didn't like the story.

581
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,721
It looks like the production
is going to be on hold.

582
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:55,893
The movie production might...

583
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,729
fall through.

584
00:51:00,523 --> 00:51:02,441
Oh, really?

585
00:51:02,651 --> 00:51:04,818
You might be hurt.

586
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:09,198
Not me. But you might be.

587
00:51:09,407 --> 00:51:12,660
You read my essay, didn't you?

588
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:17,539
I never thought about getting
the main role.

589
00:51:17,749 --> 00:51:19,250
It's okay.

590
00:51:19,459 --> 00:51:21,835
The good thing is that I met you.

591
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:25,589
I felt wonderful...

592
00:51:27,592 --> 00:51:30,427
Seeing myself in the mirror,

593
00:51:30,637 --> 00:51:33,931
picturing myself
among beautiful things.

594
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:39,603
That's incredible.
I trained myself hard to release pain.

595
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:46,568
That's why I could go through
the difficult lessons.

596
00:51:46,778 --> 00:51:51,031
But, after all, I lost ballet too.

597
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:05,629
It's hard to overcome
that experience...

598
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,969
but someday you'll feel
life is wonderful.

599
00:52:13,805 --> 00:52:17,308
That's life, isn't it?

600
00:52:32,157 --> 00:52:34,116
Thank you.

601
00:52:35,618 --> 00:52:38,787
Living alone is a hassle.

602
00:52:38,997 --> 00:52:42,458
I have nobody to talk to.

603
00:52:44,002 --> 00:52:46,712
There were some guys
who approached me,

604
00:52:46,921 --> 00:52:51,592
but you're the first one
who is really warmhearted

605
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,053
and tries to accept

606
00:52:54,262 --> 00:52:59,266
and understand who I really am.

607
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:03,520
Let's have dinner soon.

608
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:06,023
When will that be?

609
00:53:07,776 --> 00:53:09,485
Sorry, am I pushing you?

610
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,614
I'll call you.

611
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:16,533
Yes. I'll look forward to it.

612
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,215
You can stop here.

613
00:53:31,424 --> 00:53:33,425
Please stop the car.

614
00:53:33,635 --> 00:53:35,177
She's getting out.

615
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:43,227
Thank you very much for today.

616
00:53:43,436 --> 00:53:45,145
See you.

617
00:53:49,818 --> 00:53:52,403
- Good night.
- Good night.

618
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,415
Take me to Okusawa.

619
00:54:28,106 --> 00:54:29,648
Yes.

620
00:54:32,026 --> 00:54:34,695
Can I talk to you for a moment?

621
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,155
What?

622
00:54:42,203 --> 00:54:43,871
The curtain is dirty.

623
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,831
What?

624
00:54:50,378 --> 00:54:54,548
- Well...
- You found a girlfriend.

625
00:54:54,757 --> 00:54:56,717
Right?

626
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,385
Bingo.

627
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:03,807
You're acting strange lately.
Sometimes you smile to yourself.

628
00:55:09,314 --> 00:55:12,316
She is just 24 years old.

629
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,402
She's closer to my age.

630
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,446
She must be very beautiful.

631
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,241
I'm the same as you.
I like pretty girls.

632
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,535
Don't get fooled.

633
00:55:24,662 --> 00:55:27,080
I'm much smarter than you.

634
00:55:28,374 --> 00:55:31,084
Have you proposed to her?

635
00:55:32,253 --> 00:55:33,837
Not yet.

636
00:55:34,047 --> 00:55:36,006
We're going away this weekend.

637
00:55:36,216 --> 00:55:37,966
I'm going to propose to her then.

638
00:55:38,176 --> 00:55:39,635
Good luck!

639
00:55:41,554 --> 00:55:45,307
I'll introduce her to you soon.

640
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:51,230
If I think she's all right
it will be fine...

641
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:56,860
because you're in love now,
and love is blind.

642
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,509
Well...

643
00:57:03,803 --> 00:57:06,638
What can we do before dinner?

644
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:12,102
The chef here is very skilled.

645
00:57:12,312 --> 00:57:16,023
He prepares very good food.
You can look forward to it.

646
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:20,777
Not only is he a good chef,
he also has a bad mouth.

647
00:57:25,533 --> 00:57:29,786
There is a small museum close by.

648
00:57:29,996 --> 00:57:34,666
If we leave now,
we can still make it.

649
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,729
It's about 20 minutes away by car.

650
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:05,030
After that, we can go to the harbor.

651
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,577
It's a little harbor,
but there is a great coffee shop.

652
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:15,290
And they serve delicious cheesecake.

653
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,459
The desserts are...

654
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:24,776
Come to me.

655
00:59:31,117 --> 00:59:32,701
Please.

656
00:59:52,513 --> 00:59:55,390
No. Don't take off your clothes yet.

657
01:00:00,354 --> 01:00:02,147
Please...

658
01:00:04,776 --> 01:00:07,319
look at my body.

659
01:00:44,982 --> 01:00:50,445
I burnt myself when I was little.

660
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:59,538
I want you to know all about me.

661
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:19,266
You're very beautiful.

662
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:28,066
Please love me. Only me.

663
01:01:30,611 --> 01:01:32,445
I will.

664
01:01:34,532 --> 01:01:36,825
Everybody says so.

665
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:42,122
But I hope you're different
from other guys.

666
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:47,711
Only me. Okay?

667
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,298
Only me.

668
01:01:52,425 --> 01:01:54,467
Please love me. Only me.

669
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,800
- Yes.
- Is this Mr. Aoyama?

670
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:01,261
This is the front desk.

671
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:02,846
Yes.

672
01:04:03,055 --> 01:04:06,433
I'm terribly sorry.
You must be in bed.

673
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:10,854
We called a few times,
but no one answered.

674
01:04:12,106 --> 01:04:14,524
Since your partner left,

675
01:04:14,734 --> 01:04:17,944
we wanted to know if you're staying.

676
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:20,530
I'm sorry to call you so late.

677
01:04:23,367 --> 01:04:24,993
Left?

678
01:04:34,378 --> 01:04:37,047
What do you mean
she disappeared?

679
01:04:38,632 --> 01:04:41,051
She doesn't answer the phone.

680
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:44,012
There is no way to contact her.

681
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:47,640
When I send her home by taxi,

682
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:51,644
she usually gets out on a nearby street,
not in front of her place.

683
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,819
What happened at the hotel?

684
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,488
I just told you everything.

685
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:04,407
People don't just disappear like that.

686
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:12,415
We might have
misunderstood each other.

687
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:17,045
I just want to talk to her face-to-face.

688
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:23,593
Yoshikawa, can you
find out her address?

689
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:29,849
Listen to me.
All we got is her résumé.

690
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,143
It's impossible.

691
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:35,146
Aoyama...

692
01:05:35,356 --> 01:05:38,858
Why don't you forget about her?

693
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:41,361
I can't do that.

694
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:45,198
I know I can't convince you, but...

695
01:05:45,407 --> 01:05:49,119
Anyway, I think
you should forget about her.

696
01:06:01,549 --> 01:06:03,133
You're saying...

697
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:05,885
that I got too crazy...

698
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:10,682
about a young girl.

699
01:06:12,393 --> 01:06:14,269
Are you saying...

700
01:06:15,896 --> 01:06:17,897
I'm a pathetic, lonely,
middle-aged man?

701
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:21,151
Yes, you are.

702
01:06:25,197 --> 01:06:27,657
What's the matter with you?

703
01:06:27,867 --> 01:06:30,660
Didn't you say,
"I wasn't born yesterday"?

704
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:35,456
Whatever problems come up,
you can fix them, right?

705
01:06:41,672 --> 01:06:43,214
What?

706
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,509
It's okay.

707
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:48,094
What's okay?

708
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:50,555
It's okay now.

709
01:06:51,682 --> 01:06:55,685
I won't ask for your help anymore.
I'll look for her by myself.

710
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:09,407
- I'll find her by myself!
- Aoyama!

711
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:45,818
Shimada Ballet Studio

712
01:08:20,562 --> 01:10:23,309
Excuse me.

713
01:10:28,941 --> 01:10:30,608
Are you...

714
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,237
Mr. Shimada?

715
01:10:36,615 --> 01:10:38,866
I am...

716
01:10:39,076 --> 01:10:41,452
the one who called you
this afternoon.

717
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,086
Hello?

718
01:10:50,295 --> 01:10:54,173
- Regarding Miss Asami Yamazaki.
- Go home.

719
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,222
Well...

720
01:11:02,349 --> 01:11:04,851
Let me be frank with you.

721
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,479
Did you have any problems...

722
01:11:09,773 --> 01:11:12,191
with Asami before?

723
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:17,155
I just want to know
how to contact her.

724
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:22,452
Do you know her whereabouts?

725
01:11:40,387 --> 01:11:41,846
So...

726
01:11:42,973 --> 01:11:44,682
did you see her?

727
01:11:47,019 --> 01:11:48,436
Yes.

728
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:57,820
Did you hear her voice?

729
01:11:59,907 --> 01:12:02,992
What do you mean by that?

730
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:12,460
Did you touch her body?

731
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:17,256
Did you hold her in your arms?

732
01:12:18,926 --> 01:12:20,593
How was that?

733
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,638
Was it good?

734
01:12:28,852 --> 01:12:31,812
Did you smell her?

735
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:05,054
Asami.

736
01:13:29,121 --> 01:13:30,830
Go home.

737
01:13:45,095 --> 01:13:47,179
4th Street. The Stone Fish.

738
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:47,490
The Stone Fish

739
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:55,164
No one is there.

740
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:04,256
Is it closed today?

741
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:07,343
That bar has been closed
for more than a year.

742
01:15:09,054 --> 01:15:10,680
What?

743
01:15:15,102 --> 01:15:18,521
The owner was murdered.
That was a huge mess.

744
01:15:19,856 --> 01:15:24,276
Do you know an Asami
who used to work here?

745
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:25,778
Asami?

746
01:15:25,987 --> 01:15:27,822
I don't recall.

747
01:15:28,031 --> 01:15:32,368
Normally the owner worked here alone.

748
01:15:32,577 --> 01:15:37,456
Asami was supposed to work here
three times a week.

749
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:40,751
I don't think so.

750
01:15:40,961 --> 01:15:44,964
Excuse me.
Why was the owner killed?

751
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:51,303
I'm not sure, but...

752
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:54,265
people say it was about
some sort of man problem.

753
01:15:54,474 --> 01:15:57,727
She was having an affair
with a music industry guy.

754
01:15:57,936 --> 01:16:00,604
She used drugs too.

755
01:16:03,275 --> 01:16:05,234
Did she get murdered here?

756
01:16:05,444 --> 01:16:09,113
The body was chopped up completely.

757
01:16:09,322 --> 01:16:14,660
It's a 28-year-old building.
The whole building is tilted.

758
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:17,913
We saw her blood flowing
through the gap under the door.

759
01:16:19,124 --> 01:16:22,334
The other mystery was...

760
01:16:24,296 --> 01:16:29,675
The police collected all the body parts
and tried to put it together.

761
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:34,221
They found three extra fingers
and an extra ear...

762
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:37,057
and an extra tongue as well.

763
01:16:44,983 --> 01:16:47,359
Isn't it a terrible world?

764
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:17,389
Mealtime, Gang.

765
01:17:24,481 --> 01:17:25,856
Bye.

766
01:18:20,036 --> 01:18:22,997
Hi, this is Shigehiko.

767
01:18:23,206 --> 01:18:27,167
I'm going to stay at
my friend's house tonight.

768
01:18:27,377 --> 01:18:30,713
It's none of my business,
but eat properly.

769
01:18:30,922 --> 01:18:33,966
There's some yogurt.
You can eat it if you want.

770
01:18:35,093 --> 01:18:39,138
And Gang was hiding
underneath the house,

771
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:41,140
so please feed him
when he comes out.

772
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:42,725
Talk to you later.

773
01:20:15,986 --> 01:20:17,486
I'm sorry.

774
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:20,864
So, how are you?

775
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:27,162
I didn't think
I would see you again,

776
01:20:27,372 --> 01:20:29,540
so I'm pretty excited.

777
01:20:32,877 --> 01:20:36,547
I didn't ask you about your family.

778
01:20:36,756 --> 01:20:39,133
Are they fine?

779
01:20:50,186 --> 01:20:54,148
When I was little,
my parents got a divorce.

780
01:20:55,275 --> 01:20:59,319
I was sent to my uncle's house.

781
01:21:01,406 --> 01:21:03,741
That was a terrible place.

782
01:21:07,287 --> 01:21:11,081
I only remember being abused.

783
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:16,086
My uncle's wife
was that kind of woman.

784
01:21:18,339 --> 01:21:22,217
I used to have many scars.

785
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:32,352
If it's too painful,
you don't have to talk about that.

786
01:21:32,562 --> 01:21:37,566
No, I want you to know
everything about me.

787
01:21:40,236 --> 01:21:45,407
I was forced into cold baths
in winter, and I got pneumonia.

788
01:21:48,369 --> 01:21:53,707
She pushed me down the stairs,
and I broke my shoulder bones.

789
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:59,088
The doctor got worried about me.

790
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:04,676
He sent me back
to my mother's house.

791
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:10,599
How old were you?

792
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:14,353
I was seven years old.

793
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:19,483
I see.

794
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:30,285
My mother got remarried.

795
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:35,707
I didn't get any more scars...

796
01:22:39,212 --> 01:22:41,338
but my stepfather...

797
01:22:42,465 --> 01:22:45,634
hated me so much.

798
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:51,890
He had bad legs.

799
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,560
He used to stay home all the time.

800
01:22:57,272 --> 01:23:01,150
I did nothing...

801
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:04,194
in a dark room every day...

802
01:23:05,321 --> 01:23:09,992
until my mother came home.

803
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:13,662
I'm sorry.

804
01:23:15,373 --> 01:23:19,459
It's not an easy story, is it?

805
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:24,381
If you dislike me...

806
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:28,760
please say so.

807
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:30,637
Strange.

808
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:36,810
I never imagined
you'd had such a painful past.

809
01:23:37,937 --> 01:23:40,606
Because ballet helped me get through.

810
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:43,025
You had talent.

811
01:23:43,234 --> 01:23:47,779
I'm not sure,
but only when I danced it...

812
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:52,284
purified the dark side of me.

813
01:23:53,411 --> 01:24:00,000
That might be the reason
why I didn't kill myself.

814
01:24:08,718 --> 01:24:11,845
I think you're wonderful.

815
01:24:14,515 --> 01:24:18,727
I've been looking
for someone like you.

816
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:22,731
Darling.

817
01:24:30,531 --> 01:24:32,241
Ryoko.

818
01:24:34,494 --> 01:24:37,371
This is a good opportunity
to introduce you.

819
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,748
This is Asami Yamazaki.

820
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:54,096
She isn't good for you. No!

821
01:24:56,432 --> 01:24:58,267
She is a very fine woman.

822
01:24:58,476 --> 01:24:59,977
No...

823
01:25:01,104 --> 01:25:02,771
No!

824
01:25:04,274 --> 01:25:05,857
Darling.

825
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:11,238
I want you right now.

826
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:40,142
Asami.

827
01:25:55,116 --> 01:25:57,909
It was just a mistake, right?

828
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:00,287
You made love to me.

829
01:26:01,414 --> 01:26:03,790
Only once.

830
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,169
I expected something from you.

831
01:26:08,963 --> 01:26:10,756
Was I stupid?

832
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:12,883
Sorry.

833
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:17,137
Forgive me.

834
01:26:17,347 --> 01:26:21,683
I'll do anything
to give you pleasure.

835
01:26:23,019 --> 01:26:26,688
I like doing this.

836
01:26:26,898 --> 01:26:29,900
What are you doing? Stop it.

837
01:26:36,449 --> 01:26:39,451
Look, you've got a hard-on.

838
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:41,203
Stop it!

839
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

840
01:28:01,117 --> 01:28:06,037
Meal...

841
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:47,787
Three extra fingers, an extra ear...

842
01:28:47,997 --> 01:28:51,833
and an extra tongue as well.

843
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,476
Yummy!

844
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:25,784
You'll love only me, right?

845
01:29:25,993 --> 01:29:27,452
Only me.

846
01:29:51,269 --> 01:29:58,400
Asami.

847
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:00,860
Dance for me.

848
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:08,285
Dance.

849
01:30:08,494 --> 01:30:10,579
Dance, you bitch!

850
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:15,208
Dance for me, or...

851
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:19,421
I'll torture you as usual.

852
01:30:21,924 --> 01:30:27,053
Dance. Please dance for me.

853
01:30:27,263 --> 01:30:31,391
Dance!

854
01:30:46,198 --> 01:30:47,741
Asami.

855
01:30:49,035 --> 01:30:51,036
Good girl.

856
01:31:05,301 --> 01:31:06,509
Asami!

857
01:31:45,049 --> 01:31:46,758
This wire...

858
01:31:46,967 --> 01:31:50,637
can cut flesh and bones easily.

859
01:32:10,241 --> 01:32:13,284
You're wonderful.

860
01:32:16,122 --> 01:32:19,666
I never felt unhappy...

861
01:32:20,793 --> 01:32:25,714
because I have been unhappy
all the time.

862
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:29,551
Asami.

863
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,512
Please stop! No!

864
01:32:33,639 --> 01:32:37,934
A man can't function...

865
01:32:39,061 --> 01:32:41,312
without a woman's help.

866
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:43,148
Aoyama.

867
01:32:44,275 --> 01:32:45,692
Conduct an audition.

868
01:32:54,285 --> 01:32:56,369
My son told me that...

869
01:32:56,579 --> 01:33:00,915
I looked dispirited,
so I should get remarried.

870
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:03,918
That's why I decided.

871
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:00,099
Asami.

872
01:34:14,573 --> 01:34:16,616
Asami...

873
01:34:22,331 --> 01:34:23,706
You...

874
01:34:44,937 --> 01:34:46,980
You can't move anymore.

875
01:34:48,107 --> 01:34:51,985
You'll be paralyzed,
but your nerves will still have feeling.

876
01:34:57,116 --> 01:35:02,203
That way your skin gets sensitive
and you can enjoy the pain.

877
01:36:37,716 --> 01:36:40,551
You guys auditioned many girls...

878
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:43,596
and you didn't pick me...

879
01:36:44,723 --> 01:36:47,517
but you called me afterward.

880
01:36:47,726 --> 01:36:50,019
You just wanted
to have sex with me.

881
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:53,022
All guys are the same.

882
01:37:54,334 --> 01:38:03,926
Deeper, deeper...

883
01:38:05,596 --> 01:38:07,055
Painful?

884
01:38:09,767 --> 01:38:12,310
Words create lies.

885
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:14,854
Pain can be trusted.

886
01:38:17,483 --> 01:38:19,025
Right?

887
01:38:22,404 --> 01:38:24,697
You can feel pain.

888
01:38:24,907 --> 01:38:27,825
You can study
the human body as well.

889
01:38:28,952 --> 01:38:30,828
Deeper, deeper...

890
01:38:33,749 --> 01:38:36,417
That's the most painful spot
around the belly.

891
01:38:39,838 --> 01:38:41,547
How about...

892
01:38:41,757 --> 01:38:42,924
here too?

893
01:38:44,843 --> 01:38:46,219
Here as well.

894
01:38:48,013 --> 01:38:49,222
Right?

895
01:38:50,349 --> 01:40:14,140
Deeper, deeper...

896
01:40:20,105 --> 01:40:21,564
See?

897
01:40:21,773 --> 01:40:24,358
Underneath the eyes
is also very painful.

898
01:40:30,115 --> 01:40:33,117
You only realize who you are

899
01:40:33,327 --> 01:40:35,703
by going through pain
and suffering.

900
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:38,915
Only when you feel pain

901
01:40:39,124 --> 01:40:41,834
can you know
the shape of your heart.

902
01:40:49,635 --> 01:40:53,763
Your son's name is Shigehiko, right?

903
01:40:57,309 --> 01:41:02,730
Your son has to feel pain.
Then you'll understand more.

904
01:41:04,233 --> 01:41:05,691
Stop that.

905
01:41:07,486 --> 01:41:10,780
Stay away from my son.

906
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:15,076
You love your son too?

907
01:41:16,286 --> 01:41:19,372
You are a liar.
You only love me, right?

908
01:41:21,124 --> 01:41:24,377
I've got only you.

909
01:41:24,586 --> 01:41:27,380
But you have many others.

910
01:41:31,093 --> 01:41:34,345
I don't want to be
just one of those.

911
01:41:38,267 --> 01:41:40,601
Even if I give you everything I have,

912
01:41:40,811 --> 01:41:44,230
you won't be mine completely.

913
01:41:46,024 --> 01:41:47,900
Everybody is the same.

914
01:41:49,695 --> 01:41:54,198
Everybody.

915
01:42:08,005 --> 01:42:11,549
You can't escape without your feet.

916
01:42:19,349 --> 01:42:24,603
This wire can cut flesh
and bones so easily.

917
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:30,234
Stop.

918
01:42:31,069 --> 01:42:32,737
Stop it!

919
01:44:08,583 --> 01:44:10,584
Right foot, please.

920
01:44:26,935 --> 01:44:28,561
I'm home.

921
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:30,896
Dad, are you still awake?

922
01:44:40,407 --> 01:44:44,118
My friend got sick all of sudden.

923
01:44:44,327 --> 01:44:46,745
Then we called an ambulance.

924
01:44:57,716 --> 01:44:59,341
Are you sleeping?

925
01:45:11,563 --> 01:45:13,772
What happened, Dad?

926
01:46:39,317 --> 01:46:41,485
What's going on?

927
01:46:53,123 --> 01:46:55,332
What's wrong?

928
01:46:55,542 --> 01:46:57,585
Are you okay?

929
01:46:59,337 --> 01:47:02,131
Yes. Yes.

930
01:47:13,768 --> 01:47:15,394
Well...

931
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:19,064
I...

932
01:47:20,525 --> 01:47:23,152
I will respond to your proposal.

933
01:47:25,363 --> 01:47:26,739
What?

934
01:47:30,118 --> 01:47:34,246
Your proposal...

935
01:47:35,373 --> 01:47:37,124
I accept.

936
01:47:42,547 --> 01:47:44,173
Proposal?

937
01:47:52,724 --> 01:47:55,434
It's like a dream.

938
01:47:58,021 --> 01:48:00,731
I'm so happy.

939
01:48:05,487 --> 01:48:08,113
Among the girls
who auditioned for the role...

940
01:48:09,949 --> 01:48:12,284
I am...

941
01:48:14,954 --> 01:48:17,122
the luckiest one.

942
01:48:19,209 --> 01:48:23,045
Because I became the real heroine...

943
01:48:24,172 --> 01:48:26,965
not in the movie.

944
01:48:53,535 --> 01:48:55,035
Deeper, deeper...

945
01:48:56,204 --> 01:48:58,747
What happened, Dad?

946
01:49:04,212 --> 01:49:05,713
Who the hell are you?

947
01:49:11,344 --> 01:49:12,761
What do you want?

948
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:24,398
What?

949
01:50:19,704 --> 01:50:21,246
Dad!

950
01:50:22,832 --> 01:50:24,708
Are you all right, Dad?

951
01:50:25,835 --> 01:50:27,419
Dad!

952
01:50:29,297 --> 01:50:31,507
Call the police...

953
01:50:41,351 --> 01:50:42,684
Is this the police?

954
01:50:42,894 --> 01:50:45,687
This is the Aoyama residence
in Okusawa.

955
01:50:45,897 --> 01:50:48,148
Please send an ambulance right now.

956
01:50:49,526 --> 01:50:51,860
My father has been seriously injured.

957
01:50:52,070 --> 01:50:54,613
And a woman too.

958
01:50:56,241 --> 01:50:58,200
I don't know the details.

959
01:50:58,409 --> 01:51:02,204
His left leg has been chopped off
and is bleeding badly.

960
01:51:02,413 --> 01:51:04,832
Yes. Yes.

961
01:51:05,041 --> 01:51:09,169
The address is Setagaya-ku,
Okusawa, 6-20-4.

962
01:51:11,005 --> 01:51:13,632
I thought you were a busy man.

963
01:51:15,426 --> 01:51:18,095
I don't know what you do very well.

964
01:51:19,597 --> 01:51:24,643
You may think I am desperate.

965
01:51:26,604 --> 01:51:30,023
I was longing for your call.

966
01:51:45,081 --> 01:51:49,918
I didn't think I would see you again.

967
01:51:50,128 --> 01:51:53,839
Sorry, I'm pretty excited.

968
01:51:55,758 --> 01:51:59,803
Living alone was a hassle.

969
01:52:00,972 --> 01:52:05,350
I have nobody to talk to.

970
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:09,771
You are the first one...

971
01:52:10,899 --> 01:52:12,983
who is really warmhearted...

972
01:52:14,110 --> 01:52:17,070
and tries to accept me

973
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:21,992
and tries to understand
who I really am.

974
01:52:26,998 --> 01:52:29,666
It's hard to overcome that experience,

975
01:52:29,876 --> 01:52:35,088
but someday you'll feel
that life is wonderful.

976
01:52:36,215 --> 01:52:39,718
That's life, isn't it?
