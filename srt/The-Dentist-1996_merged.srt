1
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:30,410
Ah, there. Puccini should do the trick.

2
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,220
Let it carry you away.

3
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,420
There, now. Better?

4
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,498
Thank you. Oh, no. No, I
haven't always practiced here.

5
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,414
Mystory?

6
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,213
I believe there's a story
to be told on every corner.

7
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,738
I had a beautiful wife.
I had a beautiful home.

8
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,537
We had a perfect life together.

9
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,370
Brooke!

10
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,052
Underneath that clean, white surface,

11
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,057
there was the stench of decay.

12
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,336
Brooke!

13
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,976
Hello.

14
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,935
The IRS?

15
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,974
Yes. Yes, it's me.

16
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,500
Yeah, look, Mr. Goldblum. No.

17
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,692
No, Sir, I'm not trying to avoid you,
but I told you before all my returns

18
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,615
are handled by my business
manager. It's just a mistake.

19
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,493
It's their mistake.

20
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,179
You can't do this to me.

21
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,040
Yes. Yes, we can meet.
My office. No. No, no.

22
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,734
Not this afternoon. I'm
sorry. That is impossible.

23
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,011
Fine, fine. Whatever you say.

24
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,813
Yes, a checkup.

25
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,255
Yes, I could.

26
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,255
I'll see you then.

27
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,335
What is it, honey?

28
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,096
Look at this.

29
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,576
What?

30
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,650
There. You can't see that? The stain?

31
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,960
How could you let them send it back
looking like that? I can't wear that.

32
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,858
I'm sorry. I must have missed it.

33
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,249
Now, I have to wear this.

34
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,973
Well, what's wrong with it?

35
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,298
My diamond cufflinks. When I wear white
shirts, I wear my diamond cufflinks,

36
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,320
but I can't wear my diamond cufflinks because
they're still at the jeweler's having

37
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,412
the stones reset, unless of
course, you picked them up for me.

38
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,652
I didn't have a chance. I've been
working on a fundraiser all week long...

39
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,734
Things are going to hell around
here. This has got to stop, Brooke.

40
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,211
I wanted to wait until tonight but...

41
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,893
Happy anniversary.

42
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,097
Platinum. You are amazing.

43
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,460
What would I do without you?

44
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,216
I don't know.

45
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,099
They must have cost a fortune.

46
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,210
Oh, god.

47
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,700
I just...

48
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,499
Where are we going tonight?

49
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,651
That is my surprise. You
just be ready at seven.

50
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,019
Well, I need to know what to wear.

51
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,854
Your black dress.

52
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,492
Oh, that little black dress?

53
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,892
That little black
dress. Happy anniversary.

54
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,779
Honey, you know what?

55
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,659
You're not wearing anything.

56
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,979
Well, I was going to take
a shower after you left.

57
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,052
You were dressed like that
in front of the pool man?

58
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,019
I'm wearing a robe.

59
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,976
Yeah, but you got to be
careful. You know what I mean.

60
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,813
Alan, don't ruin it.

61
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,216
You've been smoking.
- I have not.

62
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,411
You're lying to me. I can
smell it on your breath.

63
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,453
Now, I have to brush my teeth
again. Just be ready by seven.

64
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,616
Fine.

65
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:17,254
Nothing. No matter how good
or how pure is free of decay,

66
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,736
once the decay gets started,

67
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,333
it can only lead to
rot, filth, corruption.

68
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,731
Hey. Hey, what is all that brown crap?

69
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,613
Make sure you clean that up, right?

70
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:42,139
Hey, your filter's shot, man. You need a
new one. I'll take care of it next week.

71
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,980
No. No, no. Not next week, I want
it done tomorrow. Do you hear me?

72
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,580
Oh, man. I'm busy tomorrow.

73
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,735
If you want to keep your job,
you'll have it done tomorrow.

74
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,011
Like I said, tomorrow, man.

75
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,452
The filth was everywhere.

76
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,811
The infection was spreading.

77
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,252
How deep did it go?

78
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,698
Right to the nerve.

79
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,980
Oh, yeah. Oh, baby.

80
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,289
Ah, yes.

81
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,857
Oh yeah.

82
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,178
Oh, that's good.

83
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,012
Get your filthy hands off her.

84
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,973
I am very disappointed in you.

85
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,414
Please, Mr. Feinstone.
- Doctor. Dr. Feinstone.

86
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,975
I am a dentist and this is my wife,

87
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,251
you filthy piece of shit.

88
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,336
Please, please.

89
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,560
Do you know what that means?

90
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,300
It means that she has got a
perfect bite. Come on, hon.

91
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,539
Show him how good your teeth are.
Show him how good your teeth are.

92
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,336
Show him your teeth, you lying
bitch, you cunt sucking whore.

93
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,496
No.

94
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,255
Show him.
- No.

95
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,531
Show him.
- No.

96
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,413
No.

97
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,539
Is the dentist here or what?

98
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,480
If you could just have a seat.

99
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,935
Dr. Feinstone will see you
all just as soon as he can.

100
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,296
Jody has jamboree at 10:30.

101
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,616
There won't be a problem. We
don't want him to miss that.

102
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,252
Could you fill this out
for me, please? Thank you.

103
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,853
I'm sorry. I can't wait anymore.

104
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,172
He'll be with you just
as soon as possible.

105
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,569
I've been waiting over an hour.

106
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,320
Would you like to make
another appointment?

107
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,376
I had an appointment.

108
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,096
I'm sorry, Mr. Schaeffer. If you
could just relax and have a seat.

109
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,418
I know he'll be with you as
soon as possible. Mr. Schaeffer.

110
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,410
Any sign of him?

111
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,496
No.

112
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,535
Great. We're going to have
to rush the morning patients.

113
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,858
I know. I know. 8:30 already left.

114
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,735
This is all going to be
my fault somehow. Watch.

115
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,495
Good attitude, Jessica.
- Watch.

116
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,770
April. April Reign.

117
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,172
Where is he? I'm calling him.

118
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,651
Alan, what are you doing here?

119
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,650
Paula. I didn't want to call from
the house, but I'm thinking about

120
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,897
throwing Brooke a
surprise party next week.

121
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,099
I wanted to make sure
the time was good for you.

122
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,530
Yeah. What day?

123
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,176
Friday.

124
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,370
Friday is good.

125
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,857
You really should
schedule a time. A checkup.

126
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,080
God, I hate dentists.

127
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,854
Yeah, but we've got that filling
to redo. It's only getting worse.

128
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,376
Well, I guess I should.

129
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,380
The office will call then.

130
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,976
Matt.

131
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,853
Hey, what's up, baby?

132
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,295
What's up, baby?

133
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,733
Welcome to heaven.

134
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,335
It's kind of neat.

135
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,811
Well, Dr. Feinstone believes that
it helps to relax the patient.

136
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,812
I could certainly use some relaxing.

137
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,092
You're a beauty queen.

138
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,099
Just the state fair.

139
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,891
I'm sorry. The doctor is not in yet.

140
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,099
Okay, fine. Thank you.

141
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,455
Will you excuse me for a
minute? I'll be right back.

142
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,453
Dr. Feinstone?

143
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:00,295
You know I don't want
you anymore. You bore me.

144
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,579
Hey, like I said, tomorrow, man.

145
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,337
I'll throw her out into the streets

146
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,177
where she belongs with nothing.

147
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,615
Just fill this out for
me, please. Thank you.

148
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,970
Hi.

149
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,898
Hi.
- I know I'm early.

150
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,779
You're not due until 11:30.

151
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,209
Couldn't wait, huh?

152
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,491
I know. No more braces. Thank god.

153
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,612
Tonight, I'm going to have
this really cool party.

154
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,891
I'd like you to schedule an appointment
for Mrs. Roberts for tomorrow afternoon.

155
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,130
Okay.

156
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,899
No, no. You've got your
seminar tomorrow afternoon.

157
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,040
Right. See if you can make
it first thing tomorrow.

158
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,050
Okay.

159
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,770
Oh, Mr. Schaeffer, your 8:30, had
to leave, but Jody Sanders is ready.

160
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,569
It's his first time.

161
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,489
Jody Sanders.
- Oh, that's us.

162
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,329
Jody, it's your turn. Isn't
this exciting, sweetheart?

163
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,940
I know you're just going to do great.

164
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,296
Hi, there. How you doing today, Jody?

165
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,251
Fine.

166
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,618
Is this your first trip to the
dentist? Are you a little scared?

167
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,733
No? Good. Give me five.
All right. Let's go.

168
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,930
Thank you.

169
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,455
I was lying down in my office.
I had a little migraine.

170
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,697
We're just glad to have you here.

171
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,640
Isn't this exciting?

172
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,652
Jessica, could you help me
with the patient, please?

173
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,011
I'm sorry. I didn't
know you had arrived.

174
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,138
I've been here for almost two hours.
We'll be in the rainforest room.

175
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,936
Jessica, where's the patient's tray?

176
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,820
It's all prepared.

177
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,700
I'll go get it for you,

178
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,132
O' king of the jungle.

179
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,377
Have you taken a look around, huh?

180
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,440
Yes.

181
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,975
We've turned dentistry
into interactive medicine.

182
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,016
What do you think about this
room here, Jody? Huh? Pretty cool?

183
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,297
You see, I think it's important
for the patient to enjoy a positive

184
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,700
dental experience conducive to continued
care. You ready to get started?

185
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,769
Today, I'm just going to
take a look at your teeth.

186
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,860
That's all I'm going to
do. Just a little look.

187
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,880
You can hold my hand, honey.

188
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,132
Okay. Now, I want you to open your
mouth nice and wide for Jessica.

189
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,178
You've built up quite
a practice, doctor.

190
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,011
A lot of money in
dentistry these days, huh?

191
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,339
I work hard.

192
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,653
Too hard to lose it all.

193
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,412
I'm sure that won't happen.

194
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,692
You're doing really good, honey.

195
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,377
If I kick her out,
she'll take everything.

196
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,690
What?

197
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,534
Every penny I ever made.

198
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,097
What did you do? He's bleeding.

199
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,372
He moved. He has to learn to sit still.

200
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,219
Mrs. Sanders, we're very sorry.

201
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,093
It's okay, Jody. We're going to go home.

202
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,731
This visit is over, Dr. Feinstone.

203
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,053
Mrs. Sanders...
- It's over.

204
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,214
Doctor, are you all right?

205
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,136
We can't take children anymore. That
child is spoiled. Spoiled rotten.

206
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,819
Mrs. Sanders, what...

207
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,011
It's okay, Jody. We're going to go home.

208
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,376
They're okay.

209
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,174
I remember my first time
at the dentist. I bit him.

210
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,094
Oh, we charge extra for that.

211
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,139
Under control. Keep it under control.

212
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,016
Alan?

213
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,097
Oh, my god. Alan.

214
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,094
Are you all right?

215
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,577
What's the matter? Here.

216
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,576
I'm fine. I'm fine. What do you want?

217
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,210
I just finished with Miss Reign,
but if you're not feeling well...

218
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,533
Is there a problem?

219
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,219
Oh, well. You don't have to see her.

220
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,380
There's nothing major indicated.
Why don't you rest for a while?

221
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,690
Hello.

222
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,853
Hello. Who is this?

223
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,536
It's me.

224
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,010
Alan?

225
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,816
Yes, your husband Alan.

226
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,693
I know who you are, silly.

227
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,413
Brooke, I was just sitting here

228
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,253
trying to remember our first practice.

229
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,057
Alan, you're not having
a moment, are you?

230
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,735
You know what you get
like. Take one pill.

231
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,495
I love you.

232
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,858
Is something the matter?

233
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,577
Alan, is everything okay?

234
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,451
I'm just running a
little late. That's all.

235
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,854
You'll have to meet me
at the office tonight.

236
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,056
Okay.

237
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,815
Tonight then?

238
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,095
Tonight.

239
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,060
Our anniversary.

240
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,054
All right. Bye bye.

241
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,209
Asshole.

242
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,336
Bitch.

243
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,978
April, the doctor is busy right now,
but he'll be able to see you next time.

244
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,058
Well, I think Steve, my
manager, wanted to talk to him.

245
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,058
He thinks my mouth needs a makeover.

246
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,651
It's the only part of me
he hasn't totally rebuilt.

247
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,218
Well, I'll make you another appointment.

248
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,097
Well, Karen. Who do we have here?

249
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,534
This is April Reign. I'm sorry,
doctor. I thought you were busy.

250
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:56,700
All the time. Decay is always
busy, so we're always busy.

251
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,580
How's the patient?

252
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,090
She looked fine, doctor. Nothing
that calls for immediate attention.

253
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,931
Good. We'll just take a little look.

254
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,452
Well, all she needed was a cleaning.

255
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,540
So I could be irresistible
with all the world at my feet.

256
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,458
There's a shadow here on number
31 right there on the X-ray.

257
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,656
Yes, doctor. There is some abrasion
on the lingual at the gum line.

258
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,092
Tell Jessica I'll need a filling tray.

259
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,575
Okay.

260
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,929
You have a cavity on one of your lower
right molars. It isn't too serious,

261
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,377
but we really should take a
look it before it gets any worse.

262
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,854
Will you have to drill?

263
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,499
They're your teeth. You wouldn't
want them to fall out, would you?

264
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,098
It's really not bothering me at all.

265
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,491
Well, we'll give you
a little anesthetic.

266
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,053
You won't feel anything at all.

267
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,219
I have this thing about needles.

268
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,420
Well, then, we'll give you a topical.

269
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,213
Needles really freak me out.

270
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,092
Have you ever had nitrous oxide?

271
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,460
Right through the snapper.

272
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,736
Jesus, here.

273
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,457
All right. Doggie bursts through fence.

274
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,095
Growl. Assailant shoots doggie.

275
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:46,455
Bullet goes right through here.

276
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,094
I think he shot the doggie.

277
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,458
Elementary, my dear Watson.

278
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,460
You don't think this is a robber,
do you? He's never used a gun before.

279
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,657
He's never had a dog attack him before.

280
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,734
To the lab. Check out the neighbors.

281
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,977
Cop stuff, huh?

282
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,978
Now, did you talk to
anybody else about it?

283
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,851
All right. Is that comfortable? Just
keep breathing nice deep breaths.

284
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,218
You have an interesting name.

285
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,014
Steve wanted to call me April Showers,
but I liked Reign, like a queen,

286
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,691
not just like Rain.

287
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,093
Just keep breathing normally. Everything
will be fine in a couple of seconds.

288
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,412
I'm fine. Why don't you take a break?

289
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,139
You don't want me to assist you?

290
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,650
Not necessary.

291
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,135
Are you sure?

292
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,216
Yes, doctor.

293
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,096
Open.

294
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,939
Right, right over there. There we go.

295
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,738
All right. Now, just keep breathing.

296
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,778
Are you a model? You look like a model.

297
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,057
Have you ever done any runway work?

298
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,335
It ain't easy. No sir. Those girls got
to be very confident to get up there

299
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,131
in front of those judges. They got
to have the walk. You want to try?

300
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,976
No.

301
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,537
We all got to have our secret dreams.
Go on. Stand up. Give it a shot.

302
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,850
No, I've never...

303
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,137
I don't know how. I've
never done anything like...

304
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,980
Come on. Take a few
steps to a new beginning.

305
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,855
Go on.

306
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,096
Go on.

307
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,296
Go on.

308
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,580
Hold your head up.

309
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,340
Like this?

310
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,380
That's it. More attitude. Throw
some attitude. Lots of attitude.

311
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,094
Do a little turn right
here. That's it. Beautiful.

312
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,170
Excuse me.

313
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,212
What the hell is going
on with April back there?

314
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,377
Dr. Feinstone is taking care of her.
- Yeah?

315
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,775
You okay, Sarah?

316
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,729
Oh, yeah. I was just stretching.

317
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,414
How are you feeling?

318
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,380
All right.

319
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,055
You don't hurt me, doctor,
and I won't hurt you.

320
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,209
Filth.

321
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,410
Whore.

322
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,657
All right. Just relax.
This won't hurt a bit.

323
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,619
That's what men always say.
They're the biggest liars.

324
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,739
Just keep breathing.

325
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,413
That's it. Deep, slow breaths.

326
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,050
I'd like to speak to the doctor,
please. He's got to know that April

327
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,576
and I have another appointment
and it's getting late.

328
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,413
I know and I'm sure
he'll be finished soon.

329
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,417
I hope so. You got a bathroom here?

330
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,572
Yeah, down the hall and to the left.

331
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,530
Excuse me.

332
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,209
May I help you?

333
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,056
I was wondering where the bathroom was?

334
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,016
It's right over there.

335
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:15,458
Do it to me, Alan.
Like a big, strong man.

336
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,219
Come on, baby.

337
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,975
Oh yeah, just like Matt.

338
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,892
Just like Matt?

339
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,172
Death is too good for you.

340
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,978
What?
- The nitrous must have run out.

341
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,614
I don't feel good.

342
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,770
You'll be fine in a couple
of minutes. Just relax.

343
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,340
I have to go now.

344
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,331
Please just stay there and sit
still for a couple of minutes.

345
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,817
Steve, Steve.

346
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,293
Please could you...

347
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,810
Please would you just sit back down?

348
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:45,000
Please. Please come back. Please.

349
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,216
This is not what I
advise. Would you just...

350
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,456
You come back inside?

351
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,000
What's the matter?
What's the problem?

352
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,658
Who are you?

353
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,737
I'm Steve Landers,
doctor. April is my client.

354
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,535
Steve.
- Yeah, baby?

355
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,696
Yes. Well, yes. She's had a
minor reaction to a small dose

356
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,136
of nitrous oxide. That's all.
- Wow.

357
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,811
No, no, no. It's nothing serious.
She'll be fine in a minute or two.

358
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,440
Okay. You're going to
be okay, baby? All right.

359
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,416
No.

360
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,895
Would you both like to just come inside
and sit down until she's ready to leave?

361
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:22,134
Some fresh air though might
bring her around a little faster.

362
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:27,298
Why don't you pick her up so she
doesn't fall? I'll be right there.

363
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,697
Okay. We're going to bring you outside
in the fresh air and you'll feel better.

364
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,690
We tried to make her feel
a little more comfortable

365
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,210
when she wasn't feeling so well.
This is the quickest way out.

366
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,576
We'll get you some fresh air,
baby. You'll be all right.

367
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,739
They're dropping like flies.

368
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,177
Candy, one of the tanks
of nitrous is dead.

369
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,960
I'm switching over to the other
one, but we need to order a backup.

370
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,653
More gas? Okay. You got it.

371
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,855
Mrs. Roberts will be
here first thing tomorrow.

372
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,179
She also asked if you'd
noticed anything this morning?

373
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,410
Noticed?

374
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,455
I don't know. Her dog was killed. She just
thought perhaps you'd seen something.

375
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,375
No? Okay.

376
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,375
Karen.

377
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,491
I'll be right back. We're almost
done. Then the doctor will see you.

378
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,017
I can't wait. It's all I've been thinking
about, just being able to smile.

379
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,493
What? I'm with a patient.

380
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,131
Look what I found in room
number one. Talk about heaven.

381
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,053
Did you show Alan?

382
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,691
Are you kidding? Did you see when
the patient left how she left?

383
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,376
He did something to her.
- Maybe they fell out of her purse.

384
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,657
Yeah, right and I can make
flames shoot out of my ass.

385
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,573
Well, give them to me and I'll ask him.

386
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:47,412
No. I don't want to cause any more
trouble. I'm already on his shit list.

387
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,893
I'll be with you in a moment.

388
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,840
Mr. Goldblum,
Dr. Feinstone is with a patient

389
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,419
and really can't be disturbed.

390
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,254
Look, lady. I'm telling
you he'll see me right away.

391
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,934
I don't think this is a good time to...

392
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,494
Doctor, this is Mister...
- Marvin Goldblum, IRS.

393
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,296
Ah, yes. Mr. Goldblum,

394
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,651
I was expecting you a little later.

395
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,619
As you can see, I'm a
little behind here right now.

396
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,419
You know, Dr. Feinstone, Alan...

397
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,175
You don't mind if I call you
Alan, right? You can call me Marv.

398
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,494
You got real tax problems. You
need to do a good job for me.

399
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,653
I got a little action back there.

400
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:32,058
All right. All right. Why don't
you just come in back here?

401
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,136
Thank you.

402
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,019
You fucking pervert.

403
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,120
I ought to kick the shit out of you.

404
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,177
What you did to April,
we're suing you, man.

405
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,336
Alan, what's happening?

406
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,215
This guy, this guy right here
is a fucking degenerate, a sicko.

407
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,293
We're going to sue your ass.

408
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,250
Is he all right?

409
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,133
Doctor, do you want
me to call the police?

410
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,173
No. I'm fine.

411
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,172
It's really not your day.

412
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,290
I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

413
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:16,058
I'm fine. The patient just overreacted.
You don't know what it's like.

414
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,019
The discipline, the long hours
and the lack of respect in a world

415
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,820
that goes on ignoring dental hygiene.
- Doctor.

416
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,017
What happened?
- You're okay.

417
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:42,937
I'm sorry, everybody. This
has never happened before.

418
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,777
Why don't you all just
please just go home?

419
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,777
This way. Come on. Easy.

420
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,416
Easy.

421
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,616
Is he crazy, Alan,
or something happened?

422
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,740
I told you. Nothing happened, Karen.
Come on. You know me better than that.

423
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,773
Look. Tell Candy to close up.
The rest of you take the day off.

424
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,452
Please, just go.

425
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,894
If it's what you want.
- Yes. Thank you.

426
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:23,130
Well, my mom isn't picking me up
until 1:30, so maybe I can wait

427
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,815
in case he can still see me.

428
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,015
I'm sorry, honey. You
heard what the doctor said.

429
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,931
I think it may have to wait another day.

430
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:48,175
Who do they think they are
with their vile infected lives?

431
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,293
Happy anniversary, Brooke.

432
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,456
Alan? Are you here?

433
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,496
Alan, we're going to be
late for the reservation.

434
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,970
Alan?

435
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,055
Alan?

436
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,089
My dear.

437
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,137
I wanted you to be the first

438
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,776
to see my finest achievement.

439
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,934
Operatory number four.

440
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:15,052
La Scala, the home of the Italian opera,

441
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,131
the finest opera house in the world.

442
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,817
I wanted it to be a surprise
for you for our anniversary.

443
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,690
Impressive.

444
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:33,577
In a world where romance has
been replaced by technology,

445
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:38,930
in this room, the two are wed.

446
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,018
Please, sit.

447
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,177
Just how many pills did you take?

448
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:54,370
Do you hear how she hits
the high notes so perfectly

449
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,130
from the depths of her soul?

450
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,419
She sings of love.

451
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,053
All love.

452
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,699
We're going to lose our table.

453
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,889
Brooke, please. Humor me.

454
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,374
Well, Alan. I mean, this really
doesn't seem like a good time.

455
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,092
Brooke, it's our anniversary.

456
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,140
Pretty please?

457
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,140
Just enough.

458
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,491
We wouldn't want to lose you.

459
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,453
You thought you could fool me, huh?

460
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,937
Oh, no. I've been watching you. I've
been watching what you've become.

461
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,538
Filth, just like the rest of them.

462
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:33,059
You, Paula Roberts, Matt.

463
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,690
You wouldn't want me to cut
out your tongue, would you?

464
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,299
What would Matt think?

465
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,173
You wouldn't be much use to him then.

466
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:13,210
Tonight, you pay for all
that you've done to me.

467
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,256
Mercy?

468
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,735
You want me to show mercy?

469
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,219
Not tonight, my sweet.

470
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,820
I never use it, the pool.

471
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,333
I built it for you.

472
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,900
Maybe I should.

473
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,097
We could swim together.

474
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,732
That's the way we were meant to be,

475
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,419
together forever.

476
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,376
No one will come between us.

477
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:20,130
Dr. Feinstone. Gibbs, LAPD
and this is Detective Sunshine.

478
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,040
Is there something wrong, detective?

479
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,291
The world is full of
wrong, doc. May we come in?

480
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,893
I was just having breakfast.

481
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,298
The most important meal of the
day. I'm a fruit man myself.

482
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,458
We've got a couple of
questions we'd like to ask you.

483
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,374
There's been a series of
robberies in the neighborhood.

484
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,090
We were wondering if maybe you might
have heard something, seen something.

485
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,412
No, I've heard nothing, seen nothing.

486
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,811
Mrs. Feinstone?
- What do you mean?

487
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:50,134
Well, did she hear or see anything
out of the ordinary yesterday morning?

488
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,616
I don't think so but I could
ask her when she wakes up.

489
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,576
Well, she's a lucky lady. Soon
as the sun hits my eyes, I'm up.

490
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,493
Here's my card.

491
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,889
Give me a call.

492
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,292
Do either of you own a firearm?

493
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,970
No.

494
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,575
You're a dentist, right?

495
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,896
Yes.

496
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,136
That's a little like a
cop, a necessary evil.

497
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,655
What the...

498
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,735
Oh, god.

499
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,575
Brooke. Hey, Brooke.

500
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,850
God.

501
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,414
Shame on you.

502
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,099
No, man. Don't. Don't.

503
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,977
It's doctor,

504
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:50,851
Dr. Feinstone and Brooke is my
wife, you filthy piece of shit.

505
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:17,497
I am an instrument of
perfection and hygiene,

506
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,940
the enemy of decay and corruption,

507
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:26,692
a dentist, and I have
a lot of work to do.

508
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,652
Don't you guys ever
start on time around here?

509
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,453
It won't be long now. I promise.

510
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,330
Hello, Sarah.

511
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,011
Hi. I had to postpone the party.

512
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,615
Paula, would you like to come in?

513
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:00,534
Well, this certainly is a little
different. You can 86 the tunes, honey.

514
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,410
All right. We're just
going to numb up that molar.

515
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,572
Jessica, we're doing a
replacement on number 18.

516
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,338
I think Dennis shot the dog, Alan. He
knew I'd finally gotten attached to it.

517
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,211
What?

518
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,178
You didn't see anything
yesterday, did you?

519
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,173
No. Open wide.

520
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,809
God.

521
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,690
We're just going to let that
numb up for a second, all right?

522
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,697
It happened right after you left, you
know. Matt didn't see anything either.

523
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:49,930
Matt?

524
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,417
The new guy from the pool service.

525
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:58,696
That Matt, he's real good.

526
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:05,253
Jessica, give me the burr block.

527
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,818
How's he been working out for you?

528
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,574
Oh, we've been having a little problem
with our sludge filter lately, but

529
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,695
I think we've got
that all cleared up.

530
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:37,896
Doctor.

531
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:43,896
Doctor.

532
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,490
Doctor?

533
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,211
What?

534
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,734
Can I speak to you for a moment?

535
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,054
Just relax, Paula.

536
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,694
I'll be right back.

537
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:07,300
Doctor, what were you doing
using that doughnut burr?

538
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,960
You were destroying that woman's tooth.

539
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,300
Are you questioning me?

540
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,938
Don't you think I know
what my patient wants?

541
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,256
Doctor...

542
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,531
Don't ever do that
again. I run this office.

543
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,377
Yes, I know.

544
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,578
When I tell you to do
something, you do it.

545
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:25,574
Now, get back in there and
take care of the patient. Now.

546
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,179
Alan, I need to talk to you.

547
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,800
Do you think that this could wait?
I am in the middle of a procedure.

548
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:36,419
I don't think so. Candy just got a
call from a Mr. Goldblum from the IRS.

549
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,740
I think you should leave now.

550
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,895
When is he coming?
- Now, I guess.

551
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,814
Leeches. Bloodsucking leeches.

552
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,375
Where the hell is she?

553
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,130
She insisted on leaving.

554
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:03,374
You clearly haven't learned what it
takes to perform your duties here.

555
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:07,132
The patient comes first. You should
have made her more comfortable.

556
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,053
Wait a minute. Are you blaming me?

557
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:16,054
Not only am I blaming you, I am firing
you and don't expect a recommendation.

558
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,920
I have found your work here to
be thoroughly unprofessional.

559
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,616
Unprofessional? You're the one
who destroyed that woman's molar.

560
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:28,891
What about this? That woman yesterday,
the one they carried out of here,

561
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,414
what did you do to her?

562
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,969
Nothing.

563
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,013
Right. Like you had to
remove these to fill a cavity.

564
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,416
Everyone else here is
scared to death of you

565
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,975
but not me. I'm going to shut you down.

566
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:51,054
Jessica. Nothing happened.

567
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,895
Bullshit. I'm going to report
you to the Dental Association.

568
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:59,496
You filthy pig. You dirty, disgusting...

569
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,538
Oh, fuck you. You're the pig.

570
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,017
When are you going to see
a dentist about that tooth?

571
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,978
I'd rather live with the
pain. What have you got?

572
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,013
You were right, Sherlock.
This is not our robber.

573
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,133
A .380 caliber slug flattened
by the dog's cranium.

574
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:28,140
Surprise me, Sunshine. Surprise me.

575
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:32,051
There's about 300 registered gun owners
in a two-mile radius of the house.

576
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,499
Nearer, nearer.

577
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:39,173
Across the street, a Dr. Feinstone is
a fully subscribed, bona fide member

578
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:43,810
of the Encino Gun Club and a
registered owner of a .380 Walther PPK.

579
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,773
A regular James Bond.

580
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,175
James Bond regular.

581
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,376
No.

582
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,450
Sarah, you're up next.

583
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,080
Just go on back and let
him know you're next.

584
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,056
Okay.

585
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,976
Hi. Remember me?

586
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,015
I'm next.

587
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,057
She's been waiting an
awfully long time already.

588
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,052
Yeah, two years and one day.

589
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:28,419
Kid, you'll understand. See,
Dr. Feinstone can't kept me waiting.

590
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:33,376
It's in his own interest or
do we start the audit now?

591
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,179
Look, Mr. Goldblum, I...

592
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,293
It's all right, Sarah.
He won't be too long.

593
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,254
You understand.

594
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,934
I can't take this.

595
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:59,334
Kid, that's nice but
next time take the money.

596
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,819
I'll let myself in.

597
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,018
Hey, Doc, you got business.

598
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,615
Why don't you go in that
first room right there?

599
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,453
Yes, boss.

600
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,971
Real nice place here, Alan.

601
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,850
Hell, this place is like a palace.

602
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,493
Like your home.

603
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:52,012
You got all these beautiful
rooms here. Real special.

604
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,812
You're not going to
put them on, are you?

605
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:00,294
I was just in the gas closet.

606
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,253
You're not out?

607
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,100
What?
- Nerve gas.

608
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,413
I was hoping for a little
whiff of the goof today.

609
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,933
Please, have a seat.

610
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,451
What do you want from me, Mr. Goldblum?

611
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:24,333
Alan, I've seen your returns.
You're doing really well here,

612
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,655
but those deductions...

613
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:30,774
Whoo. I mean, really?
You didn't really think...

614
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,939
I mean, with penalty and
interest, it could cost you plenty.

615
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,734
What do you mean?

616
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:46,933
Alan, I'm your friend. I don't have to
go to my supervisor with this, you know?

617
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:50,131
Lot cheaper to pay me than Uncle Sam.

618
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,690
How much?

619
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:58,175
You can start with these.

620
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,576
We'll use laser bonding
to reattach them.

621
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:10,054
Good. Lasers, yeah. Make me look nice.

622
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,736
Hey, doc. Don't take
what I'm saying personal.

623
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,538
After all, we don't have
any secrets now, do we?

624
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,054
Got a great marriage.

625
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:32,057
I can tell by your returns.
You spend plenty on her.

626
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:33,935
Hot stuff.

627
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,575
Well, is she, Doc?

628
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,612
Really hot?

629
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:45,579
I'm sorry, Doc. I know I got
a dirty mind. It's this job.

630
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,693
You spend so much time in the sewer.
You can't help getting a little dirty,

631
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:52,054
but I guess as a tooth
man, you know all about it.

632
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:58,019
Mild sedation is called for. I'm going
to be administering some nitrous oxide.

633
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:03,300
Great. Go for it, doc. Seize the day.
I'll take care of your little problem.

634
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:10,290
Just breathe normally and relax.

635
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:16,656
Brooke. Such a waspy name.

636
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:22,089
Those shiksa broads really
know how to do the deed,

637
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,780
don't they, doc?

638
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:26,700
I love it.

639
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:30,180
Am I right or am I right?

640
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,099
What the hell?

641
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:47,251
You'd never be satisfied, would
you? Much worse than I thought, Marv.

642
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:51,050
The decay is out of control. It's
gone right through to your soul.

643
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,770
Come on, Marv. Open wide.

644
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,256
Hi,

645
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:26,080
I'm Matthew Zeigler. Estrada Dental
Supply Company. How you doing today?

646
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,457
What is today? Thursday?
Thursdays, I'm good.

647
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,739
Great. I'm your new area representative.

648
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,360
I was hoping to meet
with the doctor today.

649
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:36,772
You can meet me. I do all the ordering.
I'm the office manager, Candy Wittridge.

650
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:45,094
Hey, you hear it all the time. Every dentist
has a screamer or two for a patient.

651
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,419
Oh, god.

652
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,053
This may take a while.

653
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,640
Get your tongue out of the way.

654
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,492
Get it out of the way, god damn it.

655
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,090
Alan?

656
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,820
What? What is it?

657
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,374
Is there a problem?

658
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:31,240
No. No. Not anymore. Low pain
threshold. The patient is fine now.

659
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,137
Okay.

660
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,011
Thank you.

661
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,660
Have you seen Jessica?

662
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:38,180
She's not here. I had to let her go.

663
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,840
We're short-staffed as it is.

664
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:43,720
We'll just have to perform her duties
ourselves for the rest of the day.

665
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:44,696
That's all.

666
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:48,450
Maybe there shouldn't be a rest of
the day. Maybe we should close up

667
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,840
until things are under control.

668
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:54,537
Things are under control. Everything is
under control. This is a business, Karen.

669
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:59,297
My business. I cannot afford
to have a bad day. Please.

670
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,420
Go back to work.

671
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,412
I just don't get it.

672
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,371
Why would he want to shoot a dog?

673
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,895
He's a dentist. They're
capable of anything.

674
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:45,420
Did you know dentists have
the highest rate of suicide?

675
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:57,137
Let's go. Come on.

676
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:13,453
Call for backup. I'm going in.
- Okay.

677
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:37,294
Oh, Jesus.

678
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:48,655
Jessica?

679
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,369
Alan?

680
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:13,854
Help me.

681
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,729
Alan.

682
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,014
It's horrible, isn't it?

683
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,213
The discoloration,

684
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,011
the periodontal deterioration,

685
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,329
the smell.

686
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:36,777
We deal with this every day

687
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:44,010
and we clean it up, the filth they make.

688
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:46,691
They hate us for it.

689
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,693
Filthy whore.

690
01:07:52,900 --> 01:08:00,899
She put his dirty, rotten in her mouth.

691
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:17,297
Don't fight it, Karen. The air
bubbles will go to your brain

692
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,020
and then it will be poof.

693
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,859
Dr. Feinstone.

694
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:44,610
Karen?

695
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:47,450
Doctor?

696
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,480
Dr. Feinstone.

697
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,490
Yes.

698
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:55,255
Are you okay?

699
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:56,976
I'm fine.

700
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:00,174
Sarah Andrews is still
here. I'm breaking for lunch.

701
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,453
Karen or Jessica can assist.
Shall I send Sarah back?

702
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:05,969
Yes.

703
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:11,734
Nothing goes on around here
without me knowing about it.

704
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:19,094
Candy, have you ever had the
slippery shrimp at Yang Chow's?

705
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:21,340
Not this week.

706
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,979
The doctor will see you
now. You can come on back.

707
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:37,859
Hey, can I take your order for a new
tropical flavored dental floss today?

708
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,374
Dr. Feinstone?

709
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:25,850
Doctor?

710
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:41,540
What we've got here is a seriously
derailed train. A man over the edge.

711
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:43,817
Black and whites will
meet us at his office.

712
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:08,779
Take a look.

713
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:15,372
I think they look great.

714
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:37,731
So sad. Now, it can only be ruined.
The rest of your life can only

715
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:41,738
spoil what we've made.

716
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:52,574
The idea that every second,
they're just rotting away.

717
01:11:55,260 --> 01:12:00,255
Can you live with that?
I don't think you can.

718
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,213
Please somebody help me.

719
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,056
Sarah?

720
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:53,249
Sarah.

721
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,498
Sorry, Sarah.

722
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,576
Please. Let me explain.

723
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:14,415
Come on out now, Sarah.

724
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:21,054
Sarah. You can't hide.

725
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:27,978
Not from your dentist.
I know where you are.

726
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:57,257
Why didn't you answer
when I called you, Sarah?

727
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:49,849
So sorry, Sarah.

728
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,375
So young,

729
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,056
so innocent.

730
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:08,096
Still decay is just
knocking at your door.

731
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:13,180
Open wide, Sarah. Let me in.

732
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:20,615
Do you understand that's the way it is?

733
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:23,690
Do you?

734
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,134
I'm sorry.

735
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:49,739
Please. I won't eat candy. I'll
brush three times a day. Please.

736
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,814
Pretty please.

737
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,096
Pretty please, Dr. Feinstone.

738
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:03,330
Three times a day. Three times a day.

739
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,134
Three times a day.

740
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:11,774
No candy.

741
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:14,292
Three times.

742
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:18,490
Three times a day. No candy.

743
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

744
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:56,377
It's okay. It's okay.

745
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:00,336
Just tell me where he
is. You're safe now.

746
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:38,858
He didn't say where he was going? Did he
say anything at all? A place, anything?

747
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:43,095
A good marriage. A great dentist.

748
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:46,139
Did he mention a name? Anybody?

749
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:49,696
A respected teacher.

750
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
God, will you shut up? Don't you
get it? He's a fucking lunatic.
Did you say teacher?
Did you say teacher?

751
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,092
I really think she need some anesthetic.

752
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:16,177
Pain is an abstract emotion.
It has to be managed, shaped,

753
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:19,737
disregarded as a distraction. Continue.

754
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:24,533
What have we got here?

755
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:31,660
A pulsating gum. A vile
and infected pulsating gum.

756
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:35,132
Just ready and waiting for lancing.

757
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:36,660
I want a second opinion.

758
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:41,054
My second opinion is extract.

759
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:43,140
Extract what?

760
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,296
All of them.

761
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:49,374
You heard me. Extract.

762
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:50,696
What is he talking about?

763
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:55,178
I want everybody to extract.

764
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,259
I said extract.

765
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:03,895
My god.
- Now!

766
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:12,618
Extract now. I said extract.

767
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,696
Why did you kill me, Alan?

768
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:21,819
Why?

769
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,298
You sick bastard.

770
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:51,494
Feinstone, drop the gun now.

771
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:02,056
Now.

772
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:05,731
Move it. Move it. Move it. Go. Go.

773
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Damn.

774
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:26,935
Out of the way.

775
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:32,499
That way. That way.

776
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,099
Enough about me.

777
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:28,256
You sure want the anesthetic?
You won't feel the pain.

778
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:38,020
Okay, Feinstone. It's time
for your regular visit.

779
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:42,610
No. I won't. I won't go.
You can't make me.

780
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:47,459
I won't. I won't.

781
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:49,180
Okay, guys.

782
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,295
Please no.

783
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,530
Yes.
