1
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,663
Whippoorwill flies about
27 miles an hour.

2
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:19,069
That what you thought
it would have been?

3
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:27,736
I'd have thought more like

4
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:31,573
31 or something.

5
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:37,822
32.

6
00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:45,354
Goddamn, that's a pisser.

7
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,164
Normally, I could
look at anything,

8
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:52,762
tell you exactly
how fast it's going
within 2 miles per hour.

9
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,500
That's fascinating.

10
00:01:57,377 --> 00:01:58,810
I'm gonna...

11
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:09,648
Get the fuck out of the way,
cocksucker!

12
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:15,312
Morning, Mayor.

13
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:19,457
Hi. How you all doing?

14
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:26,864
Easy come, easy go.

15
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:36,137
When Darwin said "fittest,"

16
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,573
he didn't necessarily mean
the strongest,

17
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:42,342
or the most intelligent,
or any one trait.

18
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:46,682
He merely meant those
organisms most well-suited
to their environments.

19
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,320
Now, we humans,

20
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:54,924
we think we're more fit,
more evolved,
because we're smarter.

21
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:56,755
But we're neophytes.

22
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,897
We've only been on this Earth
two million years,
give or take.

23
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:04,665
The cockroach, that fellow's
been around 350 million years.

24
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:09,566
So, based on that,
which of us is
the more successful species?

25
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:15,380
A lot of folks build houses
on unsafe ground.

26
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:17,849
The erosion in Cambodia
is some of the worst.

27
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:19,442
My friends wanted to
buy a house there, but...

28
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,611
Hey. Come on.

29
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:21,779
Hey, Grant.

30
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:23,686
Okay.
Later, Hank.

31
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:27,023
He's teaching
environmental studies.

32
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:28,856
He's gonna borrow
one of my lesson plans.

33
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:32,193
Oh, I know what he
wants to borrow,
and I ain't lending.

34
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:34,995
Come on, you little varmint.
Cassidy, come.

35
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,467
That's it.
Hey, can Cassie come over?

36
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:38,504
Did she say she was
gonna be here?
Quit your lollygagging.

37
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,198
Hi, sweetie.
See you guys later.

38
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:41,262
Come on!
That's it.

39
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,865
Here, sweetie.
You have
a good day today?

40
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:45,104
Very nice.
Hop on in there, baby.

41
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:47,578
Baby, when did you
go to Jack in the Box?

42
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:50,416
That's one match
I'll never get.

43
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:52,617
Ain't no mystery.

44
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:55,655
Starla's raised in them
shanties off St. Luc.
Dirt poor.

45
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,815
All she ever wanted was
to be a lady.

46
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,223
Old Grant Grant, he's
always been made of green.

47
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:02,557
Gold digger, huh?
Oh, hell, Margaret.

48
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:04,892
Starla's mother left her.
Her daddy's a drunk.

49
00:05:04,964 --> 00:05:06,227
She's 17 years old.

50
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:10,258
Old Grant pulls up,
big old Cadillac. House on
the hill and college tuition.

51
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:11,360
What would you do?

52
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,098
Blow.
Hell, if he had a 'gina,

53
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:15,698
you'd have married him, too.
What's a 'gina?

54
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:18,341
It's a country.

55
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:20,743
You know,
where Ginese people come from.

56
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:22,213
Learn to eavesdrop better.

57
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,079
Zach. Hell, your mother's
waiting over there.

58
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,016
What the hell you doing here?
Scoot, scoot.

59
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,484
Sugarplum,
you coming to bed?

60
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:32,218
...why the crocodile has
survived for millennia,

61
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,454
when so many similar species
have gone extinct.

62
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:51,306
Oh, yeah.

63
00:05:59,352 --> 00:06:00,842
You know what, baby?

64
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,313
I'm just not
really in the mood.

65
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:09,156
Come on, baby doll.
It's been a long time.
We both need it.

66
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:11,221
I know. I'm just...

67
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:18,302
Baby, come on now.
I don't just have some switch.

68
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:21,539
Sure you do.

69
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:24,071
Flick, flick.

70
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:30,473
That's disrespectful.
Come on now.
I'm just playing with you.

71
00:06:31,117 --> 00:06:33,347
Come on, honey.
No, come on, baby.

72
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,580
Why don't you just,
you know, work one out for
yourself there, darling?

73
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:37,918
Come on.

74
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:42,287
Honey, I'm just not
in the mood. Can't you tell?

75
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:46,632
When the hell are you
in the mood anyway?

76
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:51,462
Dang.

77
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,011
Where you going?

78
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,775
Out. For a walk.

79
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:09,011
Grant. Baby.

80
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,082
I...

81
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,941
Yeah.
Hit me again there, killer.

82
00:08:01,674 --> 00:08:04,109
Megan Montgomery's
little sister.

83
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:06,873
You're kidding me.
Nope.

84
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:08,875
Brenda.

85
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:14,383
My sister, Megan,
she was a big fat old cow,
and I'd be thinking,

86
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,752
"What does he see in her
that ain't in me?"

87
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:18,586
Shit, come on now.

88
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:22,889
You couldn't have been
more than 10 or 11.
Hell, I was game.

89
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:31,033
I'll give you
a ride, then.
All right, come on.

90
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:32,901
Yee-haw! Giddyup.

91
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,847
Come on.
Where we going, girl?

92
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:42,938
Come on, you.
Where we going?

93
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,278
Get over here.

94
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:48,386
What'd I tell you?

95
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:51,120
I had a crush on you.

96
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:55,117
Will you look at that?
Your initials, "B.M."

97
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:59,594
Like a piece of shit.
Oh, shut up.

98
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:01,927
At least I don't got
the same last name
as the first.

99
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:04,868
Oh, you're nothing
but a little turd, girl.
Oh, stop!

100
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:06,769
Stop, yourself.
Stop.

101
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:20,477
Wait. Wait, wait.

102
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:23,621
Oh, Grant.
Oh, God. You gotta stop.

103
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:24,815
I can't.

104
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:27,989
Starla.

105
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,594
She gets real worried about me
if I'm out too late.

106
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,793
I'm sorry. I gotta go. I...

107
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:41,373
Starla.
Yeah, shit. Go.

108
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:50,173
What is it?

109
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:53,942
I don't know.

110
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:03,294
There's a trail.

111
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:24,073
Oh. Oh, that's gross.

112
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:27,917
Come on.
Oh...

113
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:29,545
Come on. Grant.

114
00:10:29,855 --> 00:10:31,983
Come on.
Wait, wait, wait.

115
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the fuck?

116
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:46,066
God dog it!

117
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,773
Oh, God.

118
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:57,972
Grant.

119
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,525
Grant?

120
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:17,363
Grant.

121
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Grant.

122
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,648
Grant, are you okay?

123
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:46,224
Grant.

124
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:56,604
You okay?

125
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,154
Meat.

126
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:26,855
Good morning, baby.

127
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,330
We haven't heard
this song for a while.

128
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,006
I was hoping it could be
a peace pipe.

129
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,749
I'm sorry about last night.

130
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:57,791
I don't mean
to push you away.

131
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,458
Or make you feel rejected.

132
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:11,536
I do want to be a good wife.

133
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:21,743
You're crying.

134
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:25,087
Baby.

135
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:50,477
Baby, what's this?

136
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:56,218
It's just a little bug bite.

137
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:21,041
What are you so smiley about?

138
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,743
Nothing.

139
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,850
Grant and I had
a good morning.

140
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:27,511
And it's been a while.

141
00:15:28,086 --> 00:15:30,248
Oh, you slut.

142
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:31,687
Janene.

143
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:33,748
Quiet.

144
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:35,760
You're a married woman.

145
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,129
It's Grant.

146
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:41,230
I don't know, he's like...

147
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,827
It was like he was discovering
all these different parts
of my body.

148
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,770
You know,
like a little boy
or something.

149
00:15:47,873 --> 00:15:51,605
I'm telling you, this morning
I sensed a real change
in Grant.

150
00:15:58,283 --> 00:15:59,410
Meat.

151
00:16:00,385 --> 00:16:01,444
Meat. Meat.

152
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,353
Howdy, Mr. Grant.
Oh, hey there, killer.

153
00:16:04,656 --> 00:16:07,717
What can I do you for?
Give me
a couple of your rib eyes.

154
00:16:07,793 --> 00:16:09,852
How many you need?
Eight.

155
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:12,491
Know what? 10.

156
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,826
No, no, no. You know what?

157
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,330
Give me 14.

158
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:20,929
Having a party?

159
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:23,701
Yeah, yeah,
something like that. Yeah.

160
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,370
It's a little surprise
for the wife.

161
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,061
Grant. What's this lock
doing on the door?

162
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:48,062
Baby, you drilled right into
the frame. It's all busted up.

163
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:57,035
Sugarplum, you really think
you should be asking
so many questions

164
00:16:57,109 --> 00:16:58,599
when it's so close
to your birthday?

165
00:16:58,677 --> 00:17:00,543
My birthday's
not for two months.

166
00:17:00,612 --> 00:17:02,774
That's close.
Not really.

167
00:17:02,848 --> 00:17:04,543
Matter of opinion.

168
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:47,120
Grant, I'm jumping in
the shower. Baby, we need to
leave in 40 minutes.

169
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,607
What are you doing?

170
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,376
Nothing. I gotta...

171
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:20,009
I gotta go to work.
I left something at work.

172
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:24,352
What? Grant, Deer Cheer starts
in about an hour,
and you promised me.

173
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:27,483
Gotta go! Gotta go to work.
I'll meet you there!

174
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:50,214
I will never understand
what joy a grown man gets

175
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:53,149
using a $1,000 weapon
to blow the face off
a cute little deer.

176
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:54,344
Yeah.

177
00:20:00,392 --> 00:20:04,055
Surprised you're able to lift
a mug, you've been carrying
that torch for so long.

178
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:06,723
Oh, that reminds me
of something I want to
tell you.

179
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:08,823
What's that?
Fuck you, fat ass.

180
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:12,668
Melvin,
clean up the toilets.
It stinks over here.

181
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:14,467
Okay, I'll be right there.

182
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:22,578
Look what you did,
you fucking asshole!

183
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:31,784
Grant.

184
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:33,958
Damn, girl.

185
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,291
You are chocolate
for the eyes.

186
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:40,929
I thought maybe you was dead
after the other night.

187
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,658
I am dead. Don't I look it?

188
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,240
The old half-Mexican around?

189
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:52,971
At his mama's for the weekend.
I'm all alone.

190
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:55,406
Besides this one.

191
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:13,754
Hey.

192
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:15,492
Hi.
Scared you?

193
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:16,996
Hey, Bill.

194
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,539
What you doing?
Oh, nothing. Just...

195
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:24,608
I'm trying to get a buzz on,
but I can't.

196
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,341
I'm too buff.
Got too much muscle mass.

197
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,675
I don't know what it is.
Oh, really?

198
00:21:31,716 --> 00:21:33,685
Congratulations, by the way.
Thank you.

199
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,982
Yeah, on the promotion,
that's...
Thank you.

200
00:21:36,054 --> 00:21:37,454
Chief.
Yeah.

201
00:21:37,522 --> 00:21:38,614
Yeah.

202
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:41,620
Sounds weird, doesn't it?
No, it sounds nice.

203
00:21:45,497 --> 00:21:47,124
So where's old Grant?

204
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,394
I don't know.
He was supposed to
meet me here, but...

205
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:57,006
It's kind of chilly tonight.
Yeah.

206
00:21:57,075 --> 00:21:58,600
It sure is pretty.

207
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:11,249
You know...
It's probably time

208
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:13,450
for the countdown, almost.
Right.

209
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:15,755
Yeah, I think Jack's gonna
make a speech or something.

210
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:17,795
Well,
that will be interesting.

211
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:19,562
Thank you.

212
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,500
I would like to introduce
Mayor Jack MacReady.

213
00:22:37,015 --> 00:22:38,244
Thank you.

214
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,983
Cheese and crackers.
Ladies and gentlemen,

215
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:49,386
right after God invented
this world of ours,

216
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:51,828
he came unto Adam

217
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:55,396
and he said that man
should have dominion

218
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:58,392
over the fish of the sea,

219
00:22:59,037 --> 00:23:01,301
and over the birds of the air,

220
00:23:02,274 --> 00:23:04,708
and over every living thing

221
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:07,677
that moveth upon the Earth.

222
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:09,339
Amen! All right! Yeah!

223
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:13,442
Now, I believe
when God said that,

224
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:17,952
he was thinking of
deer season in Wheelsy

225
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:20,992
and how much damn fun it is
to shoot a buck or two!

226
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:22,720
Huh? Am I right?

227
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:32,334
Are you ready?

228
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:33,801
Yes!

229
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:37,934
Ten, nine, eight,

230
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,403
seven, six, five,

231
00:23:42,914 --> 00:23:46,680
four, three, two,

232
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:48,010
one!

233
00:23:48,353 --> 00:23:49,445
Oh, God, Grant!

234
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:53,690
Let the hunt begin!

235
00:23:54,592 --> 00:23:57,858
Grant, what is it? No!

236
00:25:25,116 --> 00:25:26,345
Grant?

237
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,461
Grant,
you know about this fuse?

238
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:51,807
Grant, why didn't you
answer your phone?

239
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Grant?

240
00:26:09,494 --> 00:26:12,054
Oh, my God, baby,
what happened to your face?

241
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:14,329
It's just a bee sting.

242
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:19,630
I'll be all right.

243
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:22,798
I have a little reaction,
that's all.

244
00:26:23,274 --> 00:26:25,607
Oh, we gotta get you
to the hospital.
No.

245
00:26:25,677 --> 00:26:27,270
No, no, no, no.

246
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,647
I already saw Dr. Karl.

247
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:32,313
Gave me a prescription,

248
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,909
said it should clear up soon.

249
00:26:35,954 --> 00:26:38,980
Said things like this happen.

250
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:42,091
Happens to people
all the time.

251
00:26:44,963 --> 00:26:46,794
Come on, baby, don't...

252
00:26:47,832 --> 00:26:49,596
Don't look at me like that.

253
00:26:52,971 --> 00:26:55,872
Yes, hi, Dr. Karl.
This is Starla Grant.

254
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:59,373
O£, Starla. How are you?
I'm fine, thank you.

255
00:26:59,444 --> 00:27:02,504
I was calling about...
About Grant's condition.

256
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,776
I think that it may be
getting worse.

257
00:27:05,617 --> 00:27:07,642
What condition is that, dear?

258
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,654
The one you just
saw him about.

259
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:15,651
Starla, I haven't
seen your husband
in over a year.

260
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:05,736
What's the matter?

261
00:28:06,277 --> 00:28:08,268
Come on now, don't cry.

262
00:28:08,913 --> 00:28:12,372
Now, look here.
You're doing a good job.

263
00:28:13,117 --> 00:28:16,553
I'm so hungry,
I think I'm gonna die.

264
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:21,081
No, no, no, no. Here.
I got something here,
help you feel better.

265
00:28:23,861 --> 00:28:25,693
Brought you munchies.

266
00:28:27,432 --> 00:28:29,958
Come on now. Treat yourself.

267
00:28:32,737 --> 00:28:35,331
Yeah, that's my girl.

268
00:28:36,407 --> 00:28:38,637
Everything's
gonna be all right.

269
00:28:50,788 --> 00:28:52,347
Hey, Starla.
Hey.

270
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:55,521
Bill. Wally.
Howdy.

271
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,955
Grant around, by any chance?
Oh, no. He's not
home from work yet.

272
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,329
Mr. Grant!
He's not home yet, Wally.
I just said.

273
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:05,634
What's going on?

274
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:08,905
Do you know
a Brenda Gutierrez?

275
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,232
Maybe she
called the house, or...
No.

276
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:16,173
What's...

277
00:29:16,247 --> 00:29:20,013
Girl disappeared Friday night.
Signs of a struggle
in the house.

278
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:22,343
Here in town?
Yeah.

279
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,720
The thing is,
people saw Grant
going into her house,

280
00:29:26,124 --> 00:29:28,524
and that's the last
anyone's seen of her.

281
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,688
It must've been someone
that looks like Grant.

282
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,526
Yeah. Maybe.

283
00:29:36,768 --> 00:29:39,999
But have him give me a call
as soon as he gets in.

284
00:29:41,172 --> 00:29:43,072
All right.
All right.

285
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:44,369
Well, thanks.

286
00:29:46,044 --> 00:29:47,102
Night.

287
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,169
Night.

288
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

289
00:31:33,084 --> 00:31:35,109
...116·.

290
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You've reached Chief Pardy.
No, no, no, no, no.
Please leave a message
and your call will be
returned promptly.

291
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,684
Bill! It's Starla.

292
00:31:44,996 --> 00:31:49,194
You were just here.
And you need to get back here
right now. I think...

293
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,494
Grant is sick or something.

294
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

295
00:32:10,988 --> 00:32:14,481
Why are you running from me,
baby? I wasn't gonna hurt you!

296
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:17,922
I love you, baby.
I tried not to change.

297
00:32:17,995 --> 00:32:20,021
No!
I'll get it.

298
00:32:20,631 --> 00:32:24,033
I'm too ugly for you now,
is that it?
You don't wanna hurt me.

299
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:25,569
You betrayed me.

300
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,034
I can't trust you no more.

301
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:29,771
Let me go.

302
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:33,137
Here, I got a little surprise
for you. Huh, sugarplum?

303
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:56,159
Starla?
Starla, you in there?

304
00:32:57,335 --> 00:32:58,928
Starla, you all right?

305
00:33:00,371 --> 00:33:01,532
Stop!

306
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,977
What the fuck was that?

307
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:49,317
Whole damn Council's
a bunch of fucking morons.

308
00:33:49,387 --> 00:33:52,720
I don't know how any of them
got elected. They blame me
for it, like it's...

309
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,020
Bill. Bill, we need to talk.

310
00:33:55,226 --> 00:33:56,921
Shit. Morning, Jack.

311
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,860
We need to find this Grant,
I mean yesterday.

312
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:01,194
Town Council lit
a Roman candle,
stuck it up my ass.

313
00:34:01,265 --> 00:34:03,165
Jack, your leisure activities
ain't my business.

314
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:05,965
Hey, don't you fuck with me,
Bill. Your post here
as Chief is in dire straits.

315
00:34:06,037 --> 00:34:07,197
Nobody wants to go
hunting in a town

316
00:34:07,271 --> 00:34:08,500
with a pet-murdering
kidnapper in it.

317
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:09,904
We'll find him, Jack.

318
00:34:09,974 --> 00:34:12,033
Ain't many places he can hide.
Looks like a damn squid.

319
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:14,476
Sea World, maybe.
See? She heard you say squid.

320
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:16,536
She's going to go out
and create a goddamn hysteria.

321
00:34:16,614 --> 00:34:18,138
Shelby,
you gonna create a hysteria?

322
00:34:18,215 --> 00:34:20,377
Not today, Bill.
What's this?

323
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:22,818
I thought we could
use that like a police sketch,
Chief.

324
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:25,879
You know,
take it door to door,
see if anybody recognizes him.

325
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:29,621
Y'all show
some respect right now!

326
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:32,595
And you! You don't know
what was in there.
You said it was dark!

327
00:34:32,663 --> 00:34:35,360
You don't know
what the hell you saw.
His arm was all bendy, Mayor.

328
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:38,095
Well, it's obvious
the bastard's got
Lyme disease.

329
00:34:38,169 --> 00:34:39,762
What?
Lyme disease.

330
00:34:40,404 --> 00:34:41,804
You touch some deer feces

331
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:45,309
and then you eat a sandwich
without washing your hands,

332
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,741
you got your Lyme disease.

333
00:34:46,811 --> 00:34:48,870
And that makes you
look like a squid?

334
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:52,681
Well, fuck you all
for laughing.

335
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,479
Chief, another attack.

336
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:56,281
Over at the Castavets'.
What?

337
00:34:56,354 --> 00:34:59,084
Grant's been stealing animals
off farms, edge of town.

338
00:34:59,156 --> 00:35:00,818
Oh, Jesus Christ.
All right, folks, let's go.

339
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:03,326
Don't forget your guns.
We don't want any Lyme disease
popping out at us.

340
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:06,090
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
Ha, ha, fucking ha.

341
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:10,790
I reckon Grant ain't
got one of them
puppy calendars on his desk.

342
00:35:10,868 --> 00:35:13,769
He just don't strike me
as a real dog lover, is all.

343
00:35:14,038 --> 00:35:15,801
Hey, look!

344
00:35:17,274 --> 00:35:19,300
Knocked this one's head
clear on over here.

345
00:35:19,377 --> 00:35:21,368
Put that down, numb nuts.

346
00:35:21,712 --> 00:35:23,612
He drug the cow through here.

347
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:26,644
How can one man do that?

348
00:35:26,784 --> 00:35:28,718
Slay all them dogs by hisself?

349
00:35:29,053 --> 00:35:32,045
Well, he's gotta be
in the forest. All three
ranches run alongside it.

350
00:35:32,123 --> 00:35:34,421
You think we should
get up a posse?

351
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:36,286
Head in there?

352
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,921
It's 100,000 acres.
Be finding a needle
in a fuckstack.

353
00:35:41,632 --> 00:35:42,895
Gather some folks together.

354
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:45,936
I think I know where
Dr. Dolittle's gonna
strike next.

355
00:35:46,537 --> 00:35:47,834
Right after
Grant ran off,

356
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:50,875
a calf went missing from here,
Raglan's ranch.

357
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:54,842
Two nights ago,
a mare was stolen from this
property owned by Fitzgibbon.

358
00:35:54,912 --> 00:35:56,175
That rancher with
the cleft palate?

359
00:35:56,247 --> 00:35:58,010
Yeah. I know that guy.
He looks like a chipmunk.

360
00:35:58,082 --> 00:36:00,608
Your mama weren't too proud
when you came out neither,
Wally.

361
00:36:00,684 --> 00:36:02,846
And then we got
the Castavets right here.

362
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,718
That's where last night's
shit storm took place.

363
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:07,485
And if he keeps to that
pattern, next he's gonna
end up here,

364
00:36:07,558 --> 00:36:09,890
owned by a family
called the Strutemyers.

365
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,021
I know you're all tired.
You've barely seen
your families.

366
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:16,192
But we're gonna have to
go there tonight,
lie low and wait.

367
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:18,133
Well, let's go and get
that son of a bitch, Chief!

368
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:19,192
Yeah.
Yeah.

369
00:36:19,837 --> 00:36:21,464
All right, boys.

370
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:26,107
Where's my little darling?
There she is.

371
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:31,247
Hey, Bill, we got this
grenade we confiscated
from them jokers

372
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:32,806
who wanted to use it
to fish for trout.

373
00:36:32,883 --> 00:36:34,874
No. We should be
all right with what we got.

374
00:36:34,952 --> 00:36:36,215
All right.

375
00:36:38,022 --> 00:36:40,388
I didn't know the Russkis
were invading.

376
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:44,351
You seen this guy,
you'd have wished they was.

377
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:54,229
Give me...
Just give me one second.

378
00:36:54,305 --> 00:36:56,671
Bill, I heard you're
going to get Grant.

379
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,402
Yeah. We...
I think I should go with you.

380
00:36:58,476 --> 00:37:00,467
What? Go... Honey, no. No.

381
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,739
Bill, you need to let me help.

382
00:37:01,812 --> 00:37:02,836
Look, I ain't well-read
on police procedure,

383
00:37:02,913 --> 00:37:03,937
but I'm sure there's
a heap of regulations

384
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,812
No, this is my fault.
against taking
a civilian on a stakeout.

385
00:37:05,883 --> 00:37:07,908
I should've seen it coming.
This is my fault.
It ain't your fault!

386
00:37:07,985 --> 00:37:10,352
He tried to kill you.
He had all those
physical symptoms.

387
00:37:10,421 --> 00:37:11,820
He was acting peculiar...
Starla. Thank you.

388
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:13,880
I was just trying to
pretend that it wasn't
happening, Bill.

389
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:16,723
Thank you, Starla.
I appreciate the offer,
but I can't.

390
00:37:16,794 --> 00:37:19,525
If that girl's
still out there,
how are you gonna find her?

391
00:37:19,597 --> 00:37:21,895
How, unless you bring
Grant back alive?

392
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:25,464
Your best...
Your only chance of
doing that is with me.

393
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:29,165
She's got a point.

394
00:37:41,752 --> 00:37:43,379
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

395
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:46,147
You all done, honey?
Thank you.

396
00:37:48,092 --> 00:37:49,855
Hey, come on now.

397
00:37:51,028 --> 00:37:54,794
Kylie, what did you
do to your fingers?
Kiri Goshimi done them.

398
00:37:54,865 --> 00:37:56,731
She's Japanese.
Yeah?

399
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:59,370
Looks more like that
Pokeyman's done them, to me.

400
00:38:00,871 --> 00:38:03,568
Foreign stuff is classy,
if you knew something.

401
00:38:06,844 --> 00:38:08,334
There's Jack.

402
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:12,315
Now, I want you all to
stay inside tonight. You hear?

403
00:38:16,987 --> 00:38:18,353
Hey, Otis!

404
00:38:20,191 --> 00:38:21,783
This turns out to be
a mountain lion,

405
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:24,123
we're gonna look like
a bunch of damn idiots.

406
00:38:24,195 --> 00:38:25,253
Oh, yeah?

407
00:38:28,499 --> 00:38:29,762
Thanks.

408
00:39:15,746 --> 00:39:18,545
Be a good night to
chase some pussy, wouldn't it?

409
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:22,285
How about that
Deputy Margaret?

410
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,415
You have a little
deputy thing going on,
you two?

411
00:39:27,892 --> 00:39:29,860
Margaret packs a box lunch.

412
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:31,886
No shit.

413
00:39:37,868 --> 00:39:39,097
Hey, Starla.

414
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:42,736
You remember that time
we were kids

415
00:39:42,806 --> 00:39:46,174
and you came knocking
on my window in the middle
of the night?

416
00:39:48,312 --> 00:39:50,110
So Starla here, 12.

417
00:39:50,714 --> 00:39:52,341
I guess I was 14.

418
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,012
I said, "Starla, what the hell
are you doing out there?"

419
00:39:55,085 --> 00:39:59,045
She says that she's gonna
run away to Hollywood
and be a big star.

420
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:03,192
And she knew I was
in the ROTC, so she says
she needs a bodyguard

421
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,660
and invites me to come along.

422
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:08,927
And I said, "Starla,
if there's anyone who can
take care of herself,

423
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,959
"I think it's you.
I'm gonna have to decline. "

424
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:15,672
How far did you get?

425
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,403
About the bus stop.

426
00:40:18,742 --> 00:40:21,006
Because Ranger Rick here
called my dad.

427
00:40:21,078 --> 00:40:23,809
Damn. A cop from the get-go.
You son of a bitch!

428
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:27,310
You fucked up our fame
and fortune there, Bill Pardy.

429
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,414
Yeah.

430
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:33,785
Yeah, I guess maybe I did.

431
00:40:52,343 --> 00:40:53,867
You said squid.

432
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,376
It got worse.

433
00:41:11,295 --> 00:41:15,288
He looks like something
that fell off my dick
during the war.

434
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:16,995
Hey. Hey.

435
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:23,000
Grant?

436
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:28,002
Holy shit.

437
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,084
What are we
gonna do now, Bill?

438
00:41:36,186 --> 00:41:37,984
Cuffs won't even
fit on him.

439
00:41:50,401 --> 00:41:52,096
Starla, where are you...

440
00:41:57,975 --> 00:41:59,204
Go, go.

441
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:01,907
Come on.

442
00:42:20,197 --> 00:42:21,426
Grant.

443
00:42:31,642 --> 00:42:33,303
It's okay, Grant.

444
00:42:34,578 --> 00:42:36,478
You're
just sick, is all.

445
00:42:36,547 --> 00:42:37,912
You're just sick.

446
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,179
We're just here
to take you to get some help.

447
00:42:43,987 --> 00:42:45,148
Right now.

448
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,720
And I'm gonna stay by you.

449
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,019
Just like I swore I would.

450
00:42:53,397 --> 00:42:55,160
For better or worse.

451
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,067
Much fucking worse.

452
00:42:58,368 --> 00:42:59,563
Grant.

453
00:43:01,038 --> 00:43:03,200
Marriage is a sacred bond.

454
00:43:05,509 --> 00:43:06,738
Right, baby?

455
00:43:13,484 --> 00:43:15,418
It's gonna be all right,
Grant.

456
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,083
Just come with us.

457
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:29,797
You stop right there,
you son of a bitch.

458
00:43:30,134 --> 00:43:32,830
Now, I don't care
what kind of
leprosy you got.

459
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:35,463
We need to find that girl.

460
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:38,074
Now you can make this peaceful

461
00:43:38,976 --> 00:43:40,671
or you can make it hard.

462
00:43:55,058 --> 00:43:56,924
No!
Fire!

463
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,287
Fire!

464
00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:00,126
Move!
Grant!

465
00:44:00,197 --> 00:44:02,165
Get him!
Get him!

466
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,427
Wally, on my tail!
Do not lose him in the woods!

467
00:44:08,071 --> 00:44:09,733
That fucking...

468
00:44:10,641 --> 00:44:12,802
Get the fuck
out of the way!

469
00:44:14,144 --> 00:44:15,908
I don't want to
lose anybody! Stay together!

470
00:44:15,979 --> 00:44:17,777
Wait for me. Wait for me.

471
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,441
Come on out, you cocksucker!

472
00:44:22,653 --> 00:44:24,644
What are you,
some little pussy?

473
00:44:24,755 --> 00:44:25,949
You afraid?

474
00:44:27,424 --> 00:44:28,755
Psychology.

475
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,103
Over there!

476
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,049
Where did he go?
Now we ain't never
gonna find that girl.

477
00:45:00,123 --> 00:45:02,422
Starla,
get the hell out of here.

478
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,119
What's that smell?

479
00:45:35,225 --> 00:45:36,590
Something dead.

480
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:40,963
It's coming
from in there, ain't it?
Do you think he's inside?

481
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:03,182
One, two, three.

482
00:46:04,421 --> 00:46:05,786
You suck.

483
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:08,919
Margaret, get over here.

484
00:46:18,368 --> 00:46:20,667
Oh, God.

485
00:46:26,043 --> 00:46:28,443
Something's wrong with me.

486
00:46:31,148 --> 00:46:32,274
Yeah.

487
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:36,115
Oh, Jesus! God!

488
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,354
Brenda.

489
00:46:45,395 --> 00:46:48,991
Oh, I didn't want
no one seeing me like this.

490
00:46:51,968 --> 00:46:53,129
Shit.

491
00:46:54,171 --> 00:46:55,832
How's my boy, Bill?

492
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:57,366
Is he all right?

493
00:46:57,441 --> 00:46:59,170
Boy's fine, Brenda.

494
00:47:02,045 --> 00:47:06,505
So what's
going on here exactly?

495
00:47:07,551 --> 00:47:11,647
I'm so fucking hungry, Bill.
I'm so hungry.

496
00:47:11,722 --> 00:47:14,520
I never knew anyone
could be so hungry.

497
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:18,887
Do you mind handing me

498
00:47:19,429 --> 00:47:22,228
a piece of that possum
over there?

499
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:24,528
Just a little bit.

500
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:32,932
I think we best get you
to a hospital right quick.

501
00:47:33,009 --> 00:47:35,342
What the fuck they gonna do
with her in a hospital, Bill?

502
00:47:35,412 --> 00:47:36,402
Shut up.

503
00:47:37,547 --> 00:47:39,311
Jesus!
Why is she doing that?

504
00:47:39,383 --> 00:47:41,476
Her tumors is moving.
Relax.

505
00:47:42,419 --> 00:47:45,753
Somebody get her
to stop doing that shit!
It hurts, bitch!

506
00:47:47,357 --> 00:47:48,518
Jesus.

507
00:47:52,129 --> 00:47:54,029
Please help me!
Bill.

508
00:47:54,398 --> 00:47:57,492
Oh, the little fuckers
are tearing me apart!

509
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,002
Oh, the bastard led us here.

510
00:48:09,746 --> 00:48:11,771
Christ,
look out, everybody!

511
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,445
Fuck!

512
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:19,921
Wally!

513
00:48:27,397 --> 00:48:30,560
Margaret, cover your mouth!
Don't let them in your mouth!

514
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,267
God dang.

515
00:49:06,636 --> 00:49:08,366
Tried to get in my mouth.

516
00:49:09,372 --> 00:49:11,671
What kind of thing
wants you to eat it?

517
00:49:53,817 --> 00:49:56,718
Kylie, honey,
you're gonna turn into
a plum in there.

518
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:59,688
Prune, Mama.
Plums turn into prunes.

519
00:49:59,756 --> 00:50:01,656
I know what turns into what.

520
00:50:01,725 --> 00:50:05,593
So I want you to finish up
in there and get yourself
into bed, you hear?

521
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:25,748
Time to turn in, ladies.
Just a couple more pages, Mom.

522
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:27,078
No.

523
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,448
Besides, you know
what day tomorrow is.

524
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:31,044
Family fun day.
Family fun day.

525
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:32,213
That is correct.

526
00:50:32,289 --> 00:50:34,120
So good night.

527
00:50:35,225 --> 00:50:36,658
Sleep tight.

528
00:50:37,661 --> 00:50:39,595
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

529
00:50:40,597 --> 00:50:41,860
Night, night.
Night, Mom.

530
00:50:41,932 --> 00:50:43,297
Night.

531
00:51:59,876 --> 00:52:01,207
What the fuck?

532
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!

533
00:52:52,595 --> 00:52:55,463
Help!
Emily! Jenna!

534
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,259
Jenna, open the door!

535
00:54:43,173 --> 00:54:44,697
Shelby, come in.

536
00:54:44,774 --> 00:54:48,335
11-41. I need paramedics
out here right away.
I got four men down.

537
00:54:50,547 --> 00:54:52,139
Shelby, are you there?

538
00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:58,615
Shelby, we got
an emergency here.
This is Bill.

539
00:54:59,823 --> 00:55:01,120
Oh, crud.

540
00:55:01,891 --> 00:55:03,120
Shelby.

541
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,658
This is no time for a break,
Shelby. I mean it.

542
00:55:05,728 --> 00:55:07,788
Shelby?
They alive?

543
00:55:07,864 --> 00:55:09,764
Shelby, I need your help now.

544
00:55:09,899 --> 00:55:11,367
Praise Jesus.

545
00:55:12,135 --> 00:55:15,503
Praise Jesus?
That's fucking pushing it.

546
00:55:15,939 --> 00:55:18,965
This shit's about as far
from God as shit can get.

547
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:21,533
Either of you ever seen
anything like that?

548
00:55:21,978 --> 00:55:24,572
You ever heard
of anything like that?

549
00:55:27,383 --> 00:55:28,680
Me neither.

550
00:55:28,751 --> 00:55:31,448
And I watch Animal Planet
all the fucking time.

551
00:55:31,588 --> 00:55:32,714
I got no reception out here.

552
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:35,019
I'm gonna run back to the car,
try to call the paramedics
from there.

553
00:55:35,091 --> 00:55:37,583
That's a long way
with those worms out there.

554
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,721
Yeah, well,
nice change of pace
from shooting them deer.

555
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,224
All right, you three,
get these folks
out of the barn.

556
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:45,199
All the rot and stench
can't be doing them any good.

557
00:55:45,268 --> 00:55:47,202
You take this. I got my Colt.

558
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:51,307
Be careful.
Yeah, there's a thought.

559
00:56:11,261 --> 00:56:13,286
You know what this is?

560
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:15,256
You know what this is?

561
00:56:15,398 --> 00:56:18,129
It's goddamn
biological weapons,
that's what it is.

562
00:56:18,201 --> 00:56:20,795
Government's testing them
on Wheelsy. You know why?

563
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:23,498
Because I don't take
no shit from nobody
at those State hearings.

564
00:56:23,573 --> 00:56:25,871
They wanna put a cock
in Jack MacReady,

565
00:56:26,342 --> 00:56:27,867
they can kiss my ass.

566
00:56:27,977 --> 00:56:31,174
If this shit is contagious,
I turn into a fucking mollusk,

567
00:56:31,247 --> 00:56:33,807
I'm gonna sue those bastards,
I swear to God!

568
00:56:34,918 --> 00:56:37,910
And you can sue right
alongside of me. I don't care
if you're a lesbo.

569
00:56:37,987 --> 00:56:39,284
You don't deserve this shit.

570
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:40,618
It's like...

571
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:44,149
Oh, man, it smells like
rotten mayonnaise in here.

572
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

573
00:57:25,034 --> 00:57:26,525
Hi, sugarplum.

574
00:57:28,671 --> 00:57:32,267
Marriage.
It's a sacred bond.

575
00:57:33,142 --> 00:57:34,667
Just like you said.

576
00:57:36,646 --> 00:57:40,639
What?
I'm sorry for trying to
strangle you and all.

577
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:44,582
I lost my head.

578
00:57:45,555 --> 00:57:48,752
I didn't mean to do
none of them things I done.

579
00:57:49,459 --> 00:57:50,619
Not

580
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,421
kill them

581
00:57:52,695 --> 00:57:53,719
pets.

582
00:57:55,331 --> 00:57:59,530
Not make Brenda a worm.

583
00:58:00,837 --> 00:58:03,897
But it's my nature,
ain't it?

584
00:58:05,475 --> 00:58:08,706
How can you blame
someone for acting

585
00:58:10,413 --> 00:58:13,007
according to his own nature?

586
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:16,109
I wanted to tell you
what was going on,

587
00:58:16,185 --> 00:58:19,986
but I was afraid
you wouldn't love me no more.

588
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:24,990
I never knew love, Starla...

589
00:58:25,061 --> 00:58:26,256
Wally?

590
00:58:26,829 --> 00:58:28,058
You all right?

591
00:58:29,365 --> 00:58:32,528
Maybe you better
set back down.
You don't look so good.

592
00:58:32,835 --> 00:58:33,928
Hey.

593
00:58:58,227 --> 00:59:01,789
Kylie, honey, you okay?

594
00:59:01,864 --> 00:59:04,231
Hi, Kylie, it's me.

595
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,327
Kylie, open the door,
jellybean.

596
00:59:07,403 --> 00:59:08,495
Come on, Kylie.

597
00:59:08,571 --> 00:59:10,198
Open the door.

598
00:59:10,273 --> 00:59:13,800
We love you, sweetheart.
Come on out now.
Open the door.

599
00:59:13,876 --> 00:59:15,105
Get away!

600
00:59:15,978 --> 00:59:17,469
You all get away.

601
00:59:17,547 --> 00:59:22,246
Kylie. Kylie, there's
no excuse. No excuse
not to be with your family.

602
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:25,015
This is family fun day,
isn't it, Kylie?

603
00:59:25,455 --> 00:59:29,050
Y'all better just
set back down.
You need to get some rest.

604
00:59:29,659 --> 00:59:31,320
You're sick!
Meat.

605
00:59:31,894 --> 00:59:33,590
Hey!
Let her go!

606
00:59:34,831 --> 00:59:37,459
Y'all just take
a step back now, all right?

607
00:59:37,967 --> 00:59:39,935
There you go, sugarplum.

608
00:59:41,137 --> 00:59:43,572
Why you choosing camps
before you hear

609
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:45,767
both sides of the story?
Both sides of the story.

610
00:59:45,842 --> 00:59:49,107
Why are you talking
like Grant?
'Cause I am Grant.

611
00:59:49,278 --> 00:59:50,712
I'm your husband.
I'm your husband.

612
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,579
You swore to honor
and obey me.
Obey me.

613
00:59:53,649 --> 00:59:57,017
So put that goddamn gun down.
So put that goddamn gun down.

614
00:59:59,622 --> 01:00:01,249
Oh, shit.

615
01:00:01,524 --> 01:00:03,014
Get away from her!

616
01:00:03,793 --> 01:00:06,057
It burns. What the...

617
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:10,527
Get away from her!
Meat.

618
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,433
Get away from her!
I am gonna shoot you,
I swear to God!

619
01:00:13,503 --> 01:00:15,733
You ain't
gonna shoot me, Starla.

620
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I told you, you always
needed me to protect you!
You for damn sure
ain't got the balls to...

621
01:00:31,187 --> 01:00:33,087
Christ on a cross.

622
01:00:40,163 --> 01:00:41,824
Go. Go, go, go.

623
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:44,730
Uncle Grant's gonna
show you a good time, girlie.

624
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,961
Get out!

625
01:00:46,035 --> 01:00:49,027
Open this door,
you little whore!

626
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:51,039
Don't mess with me,
you little slut.

627
01:00:51,107 --> 01:00:53,303
Kylie.

628
01:00:53,543 --> 01:00:56,637
This is your last chance.

629
01:00:56,712 --> 01:00:58,510
Open this door now!

630
01:01:00,182 --> 01:01:01,775
Come on,
you spoiled brat!

631
01:01:01,851 --> 01:01:03,080
No!

632
01:01:04,253 --> 01:01:05,414
No!

633
01:01:06,389 --> 01:01:08,221
You little bitch!
Hey!

634
01:01:11,027 --> 01:01:13,962
What's going on?
What the hell are you doing?

635
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:17,365
Hey, hey, easy, easy, easy.

636
01:01:18,401 --> 01:01:20,562
What the hell
happened to you, Otis?

637
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:23,671
Poison ivy out back, maybe?

638
01:01:23,873 --> 01:01:25,705
We're itchy.
We're itchy.

639
01:01:25,775 --> 01:01:27,766
No, they're not my parents.

640
01:01:27,877 --> 01:01:30,107
They're trying to trick you.

641
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:32,705
Hey.
The worms are in their brains.

642
01:01:33,849 --> 01:01:36,216
All right, look,
y'all stay right there
on the spot.

643
01:01:36,285 --> 01:01:38,379
I'm gonna call the paramedics
to come help you.

644
01:01:38,454 --> 01:01:40,354
And Kylie's gonna
come with me.

645
01:01:40,423 --> 01:01:41,788
Hey there, killer.

646
01:01:48,364 --> 01:01:50,526
Starla's my woman, you prick.

647
01:02:02,411 --> 01:02:06,974
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

648
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:16,086
Come on.

649
01:02:19,295 --> 01:02:21,661
Damn it!
Come on, Kylie.

650
01:02:21,797 --> 01:02:23,527
Hey, come on, come on.

651
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:27,533
Don't mess with me,
little girl!

652
01:02:28,771 --> 01:02:30,205
Hear me, girl?

653
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:35,939
What's with the spitting?

654
01:02:36,579 --> 01:02:38,945
Margaret, come in.
Margaret? Margaret,
are you there?

655
01:02:39,015 --> 01:02:41,108
Chief, go!
They're gonna get in. Go!

656
01:02:41,183 --> 01:02:43,652
My friends
are still out there... Trevor?

657
01:02:45,921 --> 01:02:47,685
What the heck is going on?

658
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:55,290
My easygoing nature is getting
sorely fucking tested.

659
01:03:24,493 --> 01:03:25,722
Bitch is hard-core.

660
01:03:25,795 --> 01:03:28,093
Get in the car.
Get in the car!

661
01:03:28,164 --> 01:03:29,529
All right, yeah.

662
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:30,922
Go, go.

663
01:03:31,934 --> 01:03:33,959
Go! Go! Go!

664
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:35,760
Starla!

665
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:39,536
Starla! Starla!
Starla! Starla!

666
01:03:40,042 --> 01:03:41,601
Starla!

667
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:55,985
So,

668
01:03:56,892 --> 01:03:58,883
how's everybody's evening?
Good?

669
01:03:59,995 --> 01:04:01,156
Good.

670
01:04:02,665 --> 01:04:03,894
Thanks.

671
01:04:09,672 --> 01:04:10,935
Shelby?

672
01:04:15,277 --> 01:04:16,939
Shelby, you there?

673
01:04:17,146 --> 01:04:19,842
Hey, Chief,
how you doing?
Did you find that...

674
01:04:21,517 --> 01:04:24,077
There's a skeeter in here
driving me bonkers.

675
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,311
Shelby,
you seen any of these...

676
01:04:26,856 --> 01:04:28,414
I don't know
what to call them.

677
01:04:28,491 --> 01:04:31,255
They're like big slugs,
only they're fast.

678
01:04:31,527 --> 01:04:32,824
No slugs.

679
01:04:32,895 --> 01:04:36,126
But your mama called.
She said, "The toilet's
all backed up again.

680
01:04:36,198 --> 01:04:38,292
"Why don't you come over
soon as you're
finished there?"

681
01:04:38,367 --> 01:04:39,425
All right, sweetheart, listen.

682
01:04:39,502 --> 01:04:41,971
I need you to listen to me
just for a second, okay?

683
01:04:42,037 --> 01:04:45,804
She said it's what you done
in there on Sunday
what caused the backup.

684
01:04:47,543 --> 01:04:49,511
All right, listen.
I need you to...

685
01:04:49,578 --> 01:04:52,446
I need you to get the CDC
on the horn for me, okay?

686
01:04:55,851 --> 01:04:57,547
Shelby, are you nodding?

687
01:04:58,154 --> 01:05:00,918
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I'll get you right back.

688
01:05:05,828 --> 01:05:09,321
There's a big tree
in her front yard and
the roots got in the pipes

689
01:05:09,398 --> 01:05:12,629
and it messes with
the whole system
on the way to the main.

690
01:05:13,903 --> 01:05:15,530
She uses lots of paper.

691
01:05:32,388 --> 01:05:34,220
Where is the Mr. Pibb?

692
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:40,388
I told your secretary
to pack Mr. Pibb.
It's the only Coke I like.

693
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:45,561
Goddamn Brenda exploding
like a water balloon

694
01:05:45,634 --> 01:05:48,866
and worms driving
my friends around like
they're goddamn skin-cars.

695
01:05:48,938 --> 01:05:51,668
People are spitting acid
at me, turning you into
cottage cheese,

696
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:55,700
and now there's no fucking
goddamn Mr. Pibb!

697
01:05:55,778 --> 01:05:58,440
Jesus Christ, Jack.
Let me get right on it.

698
01:06:01,984 --> 01:06:03,315
It was me.

699
01:06:04,053 --> 01:06:06,715
I became it... Him.

700
01:06:08,157 --> 01:06:10,057
Part of him.
Who?

701
01:06:12,528 --> 01:06:13,620
Who?

702
01:06:14,663 --> 01:06:16,461
Mrs. Grant's husband.

703
01:06:18,334 --> 01:06:20,063
But it wasn't always him.

704
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:23,632
He came from...

705
01:06:29,411 --> 01:06:32,404
He's a goddamn Martian?
Martians is from Mars, Jack.

706
01:06:32,481 --> 01:06:35,610
Or it's a general term meaning
"outer space fucker. "

707
01:06:35,684 --> 01:06:37,880
No, it isn't.
Look it up, cocksucker.

708
01:06:37,953 --> 01:06:39,148
Enough.

709
01:06:40,256 --> 01:06:41,518
Kylie.

710
01:06:42,191 --> 01:06:43,351
Honey.

711
01:06:45,027 --> 01:06:46,722
Honey, what do you mean?

712
01:06:47,263 --> 01:06:49,390
His real face
looks like a needle.

713
01:06:50,132 --> 01:06:51,964
But he's always got another.

714
01:06:52,501 --> 01:06:54,970
He goes from place to place,

715
01:06:55,037 --> 01:06:57,563
worlds, planets, killing them.

716
01:06:58,741 --> 01:07:02,905
Some he gets pregnant,
others he just takes over
with his worms.

717
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:06,505
And the rest he eats
till they're gone.

718
01:07:09,418 --> 01:07:10,909
Now he's here.

719
01:07:11,954 --> 01:07:13,149
Are you saying
these worms...

720
01:07:13,222 --> 01:07:15,623
These worms in their brains,
you saying
they're all connected?

721
01:07:15,691 --> 01:07:16,851
It's like
they're all one deal?

722
01:07:16,926 --> 01:07:21,158
An animal
that doesn't procreate.
It spreads, grows,

723
01:07:21,897 --> 01:07:25,857
absorbing the minds and bodies
of the organisms around it.

724
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:29,861
It's a conscious disease.

725
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:34,942
If I weren't about
to shit my pants,
I'd be fucking fascinated.

726
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:39,572
We're back.
Everything's gonna be okay.

727
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:51,025
Shelby,
did you get the CDC for me?
We're at the city limits.

728
01:07:51,093 --> 01:07:52,686
Welcome back,

729
01:07:53,462 --> 01:07:54,520
killer.

730
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:58,899
Got a little surprise
for the lot of you,
just right around the corner.

731
01:08:25,728 --> 01:08:27,457
Starla!

732
01:08:34,269 --> 01:08:37,467
Starla. Starla! Let her go!

733
01:08:37,606 --> 01:08:38,801
Jesus.

734
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,881
Meat.

735
01:08:55,057 --> 01:08:56,183
Meat.

736
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:01,191
Chief!
Come on, come here.

737
01:09:04,633 --> 01:09:07,466
Stay here. Stay here.
Jack, wake up.

738
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:09,764
Wake up!
Hurry!

739
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:12,267
Jack!

740
01:09:12,775 --> 01:09:13,901
Meat.

741
01:09:17,846 --> 01:09:18,904
Meat.

742
01:09:34,997 --> 01:09:36,328
Stay here.

743
01:09:50,546 --> 01:09:52,275
Worms beat us here.

744
01:09:57,786 --> 01:09:59,413
Okay. All right.

745
01:10:00,389 --> 01:10:02,619
There's a grenade
in that station.

746
01:10:03,225 --> 01:10:06,661
Now, if I use that to destroy
Grant... He's the center of
the whole system, right?

747
01:10:06,729 --> 01:10:09,459
Does that mean
the whole thing
will be destroyed?

748
01:10:09,565 --> 01:10:11,294
Maybe.
Maybe.

749
01:10:12,568 --> 01:10:13,762
Okay.

750
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:18,199
Okay.

751
01:10:19,274 --> 01:10:21,766
You wait here.
All right? Stay hid.

752
01:10:22,544 --> 01:10:23,841
I'll be back.

753
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:06,354
Okay. All right.

754
01:11:07,089 --> 01:11:08,215
Easy.

755
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

756
01:11:37,586 --> 01:11:39,111
This is Chief Pardy.

757
01:11:44,059 --> 01:11:45,390
I can't...

758
01:12:02,845 --> 01:12:04,107
Fuck me.

759
01:12:10,686 --> 01:12:11,812
No!

760
01:12:24,533 --> 01:12:27,002
Get... Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

761
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:33,540
Hey. Motherfucker.

762
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:41,613
Thank you. Come on, come on.

763
01:12:46,088 --> 01:12:49,421
We gotta go.
Once one sees us,
they all see us.

764
01:12:52,194 --> 01:12:54,629
Okay. Take this. Here.

765
01:13:01,937 --> 01:13:03,302
Starla.

766
01:13:37,372 --> 01:13:38,806
Oh, God!

767
01:13:39,641 --> 01:13:41,632
Sweetie, don't look.
Don't look.

768
01:13:44,846 --> 01:13:46,041
What are we gonna do now?

769
01:13:46,114 --> 01:13:48,083
Probably turn into a couple
of these fucked-up things.

770
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:51,313
That's kind of negative.
Well,
it's been that sort of day.

771
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:57,525
Thank you for saving
my ass back there.
You're welcome.

772
01:13:57,592 --> 01:14:00,255
Of course, when I tell
that story, it's gonna be
the other way around.

773
01:14:00,329 --> 01:14:02,593
What do you mean?
Like I saved you.

774
01:14:02,931 --> 01:14:05,764
Yeah, if we live.
Right.

775
01:14:07,502 --> 01:14:09,164
Now, they're dragging
these bodies due north.

776
01:14:09,237 --> 01:14:11,729
Do you think that will
lead us to Ms. Grant?

777
01:14:11,807 --> 01:14:13,502
You like her, don't you?

778
01:14:15,577 --> 01:14:16,840
Come on.

779
01:14:40,102 --> 01:14:42,400
Starla,
don't you be fooling, girl.

780
01:14:42,471 --> 01:14:44,029
Come on down!

781
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:03,690
Who's there?

782
01:15:06,128 --> 01:15:07,186
Bill?

783
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:09,356
Bill?

784
01:15:10,432 --> 01:15:11,627
Starla?

785
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:17,700
Hello?

786
01:15:36,324 --> 01:15:38,657
Don't you look
at me like that!

787
01:15:41,263 --> 01:15:43,322
Don't you judge me!

788
01:15:44,433 --> 01:15:48,233
You got no idea
what it's like
to be this hungry!

789
01:15:48,303 --> 01:15:51,432
I just ate pig
and I still want more.

790
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:54,404
Oh, God damn!
Don't you dare judge me!

791
01:15:54,676 --> 01:15:58,806
Are you trying to judge me?
Damn Republican.

792
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,282
We'll run all
you Republicans out of town.

793
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:29,370
Starla,
I hear you in there.

794
01:16:29,911 --> 01:16:34,246
Come on down and fulfill
your wifely duties,
you hear me?

795
01:17:33,074 --> 01:17:36,067
Starla. Starla.

796
01:18:20,055 --> 01:18:22,353
You said for better or worse!

797
01:18:22,424 --> 01:18:23,982
You lied!

798
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:25,717
Bitch!

799
01:18:26,094 --> 01:18:27,323
Slut!

800
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:28,827
Whore!

801
01:18:37,038 --> 01:18:38,938
There's the worm heads.

802
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:41,835
That's where
they're bringing the bodies.

803
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:44,936
Probably new breeders
feeding inside.

804
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,347
Oh, my God, that's Grant.

805
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:51,879
That's where
they're joining together.

806
01:19:06,468 --> 01:19:08,766
Well, now,
that is some fucked-up shit.

807
01:19:14,676 --> 01:19:16,235
There's Starla.

808
01:19:17,545 --> 01:19:19,275
Okay. Okay.

809
01:19:20,982 --> 01:19:22,814
All right. All right.

810
01:19:23,084 --> 01:19:26,384
You stay here.
No, I ain't
staying here by myself.

811
01:19:29,157 --> 01:19:30,886
All right, come on.

812
01:19:39,301 --> 01:19:44,204
You tried to kill me
and run off with Pardy.

813
01:19:44,406 --> 01:19:47,068
You just wanna fuck him now,
cause he's so good-looking.

814
01:19:47,142 --> 01:19:48,871
It's all over, Starla.

815
01:19:48,943 --> 01:19:52,345
And I'll keep growing
till I'm everywhere.

816
01:19:52,414 --> 01:19:54,814
Till I'm all that is!

817
01:19:56,317 --> 01:19:59,310
Then you'll know
what it feels like
to be betrayed.

818
01:19:59,387 --> 01:20:01,219
Won't you, sugarplum?

819
01:20:01,589 --> 01:20:04,252
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

820
01:20:04,659 --> 01:20:07,424
I just thought
you were trying to kill me.

821
01:20:07,996 --> 01:20:11,898
And you can't expect me
not to go through

822
01:20:13,468 --> 01:20:14,993
some adjustments

823
01:20:16,004 --> 01:20:17,995
after all these changes.

824
01:20:21,476 --> 01:20:24,104
You did a real nice job
decorating, baby.

825
01:20:24,746 --> 01:20:26,578
You like these memories?

826
01:20:27,182 --> 01:20:28,342
Yeah.

827
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:31,349
I know you don't wanna
hurt me, Grant.

828
01:20:39,594 --> 01:20:40,720
Yeah.

829
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:43,594
You like being called Grant,

830
01:20:44,265 --> 01:20:45,460
don't you?

831
01:20:47,736 --> 01:20:48,998
I can do that.

832
01:20:50,038 --> 01:20:51,767
I can call you that.

833
01:20:53,141 --> 01:20:55,735
'Cause you're lonely. Right?

834
01:20:56,878 --> 01:21:00,314
You've been alone so long
I can't even imagine, I bet.

835
01:21:02,917 --> 01:21:06,149
You don't have to
be alone anymore.

836
01:21:09,491 --> 01:21:11,152
'Cause you and I,

837
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:14,024
we could be together.

838
01:21:14,863 --> 01:21:17,832
I never had much use
for this world, anyway.

839
01:21:20,068 --> 01:21:24,938
And I can stay with you
while you do
what you need to do.

840
01:21:25,907 --> 01:21:29,901
'Cause it's your nature,
and I see that now.

841
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:33,671
I'm here for you.

842
01:22:14,422 --> 01:22:15,446
Pardy!

843
01:22:15,523 --> 01:22:18,755
Kill me, Pardy, please!

844
01:22:19,994 --> 01:22:24,591
You Podunk whore!
I've been around
a billion years.

845
01:22:24,666 --> 01:22:26,930
You think you can
fuck with me?

846
01:22:28,937 --> 01:22:30,063
Yep.

847
01:22:32,373 --> 01:22:33,534
Shit!

848
01:24:30,124 --> 01:24:31,490
Shoot him.

849
01:24:31,726 --> 01:24:33,091
Shoot him!

850
01:25:43,398 --> 01:25:44,558
Bill.

851
01:25:47,535 --> 01:25:48,627
Bill.

852
01:25:50,705 --> 01:25:51,831
Bill.

853
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,767
Bill.

854
01:25:56,677 --> 01:25:58,805
Oh, that...
That really hurt.

855
01:26:08,823 --> 01:26:10,188
Are you all right?

856
01:26:11,392 --> 01:26:14,760
You need both of them things
in you to get all wormy.

857
01:26:14,896 --> 01:26:17,729
Oh, that's awesome. Yeah.

858
01:26:56,904 --> 01:27:00,966
Bet you regret not running off
with me to Hollywood now,
hey, Bill?

859
01:27:01,776 --> 01:27:03,471
Oh, hell, Starla,

860
01:27:04,145 --> 01:27:05,840
I always regretted that.

861
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:15,617
Now, Bishopville's just
a few miles down the 10.

862
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:19,558
They got that hospital there
with the big green
steeple thingy up top.

863
01:27:22,764 --> 01:27:27,497
Hey, Kylie, why don't you tell
Ms. Grant that story about how
I saved you from that deer?

864
01:27:27,702 --> 01:27:28,965
Oh, yeah.

865
01:27:29,203 --> 01:27:31,035
Bill saved me from a deer.

866
01:27:32,807 --> 01:27:34,070
Oh, yeah?
