1
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,159
We're taking fire!
We're taking sustained fire!

2
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,947
Watch your six!

3
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,439
Move it! Let's go!

4
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,351
Give me some cover fire!

5
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,159
Go, go!

6
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,946
Move out!

7
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,586
Let's go!

8
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,901
Jimmy, go with him.

9
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,599
Fuck.

10
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,501
Jesus, what's that smell?

11
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,271
Oh, no.

12
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,039
What is that?

13
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,919
What the fuck is that?

14
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,079
What the...

15
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,741
Shit!

16
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,359
Where is it?

17
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,839
Garbage man found it in the
bottom of the dumpster.

18
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,159
It's over there now.

19
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,279
Is that Sarchie?

20
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,079
Yeah, him and Butler
were first on the scene.

21
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,469
Officer, if I could take that.

22
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,390
Officer, if I could
take that now, please.

23
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,745
What's that?

24
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,999
- What?
- On your head.

25
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,661
It's a hat.

26
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,039
It's a Red Sox hat.

27
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,119
I love the Red Sox.

28
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,639
Fuck that. You don't
even watch baseball.

29
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,999
I love baseball.

30
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,902
Okay, name me one
player on the Red Sox.

31
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,905
Larry Bird.

32
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,759
Don't laugh.

33
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,479
You think that's funny.

34
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,399
When a Yankee fan strings you up

35
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,039
by the balls for wearing that hat,

36
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,079
I'm gonna be sitting there,

37
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,599
I'm gonna be laughing my ass off.

38
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,399
Oh, come on, Sarchie,
we both know you don't laugh.

39
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,519
I'll be laughing my fucking ass off.

40
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,519
Six-Adam, respond to a
10-52 violent dispute.

41
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,519
1459, East 183rd Street,
apartment 2 King,

42
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,839
Burnside to Grand Conk on the cross.

43
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,759
Six Spec Ops Sergeant to Central K.

44
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,159
Go, Sergeant.

45
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,439
Run a name check on the 10-52.

46
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,399
Ten-four. Just a second.

47
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,664
What, you want a domestic call?

48
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,719
Oh, shit. Radar?

49
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,439
You know, when your radar goes off,
you usually wind up with stitches?

50
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,599
You're an adrenaline junkie,

51
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,079
and without my radar,
you don't get your fix. Okay?

52
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,879
You're right, and for that,
I am grateful.

53
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,999
Six Special Ops,

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,439
the name of the 10-52
tenant is Jimmy Tratner.

55
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,239
Any warrants?

56
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,119
Tenant is 10-19.

57
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,199
What?

58
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,199
No warrants? Could Sarchie's radar

59
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,599
be off tonight, ladies and gentlemen?

60
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,919
Do you show a tenant occupation?

61
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,999
It says USMC.

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,959
Marine. Might think he's
still fighting the war.

63
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,119
Six Spec Ops, have Adam disregard.
We'll take the call.

64
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,270
- Oorah!
- Let's go.

65
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,589
Police, open up.

66
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,519
What?

67
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,479
- We got a call.
- Uh-huh.

68
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,559
Are you alone in there?

69
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,639
My wife.

70
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,159
We gotta see her.

71
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,511
Okay.

72
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,862
Maid's on vacation, huh?

73
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,599
Watch out for a dog.

74
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,670
Ma'am, are you all right?

75
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,230
Nothing happened. She's fine, see?
Now get the fuck out!

76
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,399
All right, put a shirt on. Let's go.

77
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,639
You ain't locking me up, man.

78
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,479
You wanna go the hard way?

79
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,904
Put your hands behind
your back right now.

80
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,541
He just...

81
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,199
He just went crazy.

82
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,239
You shut up!

83
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,319
Shit!

84
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,901
Mommy?

85
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,399
Sweetie, stay right there.

86
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,062
Everything's gonna be... Aah!

87
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,239
Butler!

88
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,265
I'm good.

89
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,479
Do you like to beat
your wife and kid? Huh?

90
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,224
Next time you think about doing that,
you think of me, okay?

91
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,599
Come on, come on, that's enough.

92
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,262
Come on, that's enough.
He's a veteran, for Christ's sakes.

93
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,781
Stitches.

94
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,671
Told you, Radar-Man.

95
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,387
Double shot, Johnnie
Walker Black, please.

96
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,227
You're all sweaty.

97
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,670
You look good sweaty.

98
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,919
You could sip that, you know.

99
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,119
It's not medicine.

100
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,639
Oh, sweetheart,

101
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,665
it is for me.

102
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,751
You have a good night.

103
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,065
You, too.

104
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,439
Four-Six Special Ops Sergeant,
you have a possible 10-25

105
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,119
at River Parkway and Fordham Road.

106
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,622
The perp is possibly
still on the scene.

107
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,826
Hey, Sergeant Sarchie, right?

108
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,119
I read about you in the
paper a few years back.

109
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,559
Sarge here took down Marvin
the Molester. Remember him?

110
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,239
That was you? Nice.

111
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,519
What's the damage here?

112
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,639
It happened right at closing.
Some woman flipped out,

113
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,719
threw her own kid in the moat.

114
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,279
Little boy, two years old.

115
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,679
Jeez.

116
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,959
Lions eat him?

117
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,759
No, they've been put up all day.

118
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,879
Good. I hate cats.

119
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,719
The kid cracked his head pretty good.

120
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,439
EMS. took him to St. Barnabas.

121
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,999
They think he'll be okay.

122
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,079
Where's the woman?

123
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,239
She split against the crowd.
Now, we can't find her.

124
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,039
She must be hiding
somewhere in the park.

125
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,279
Why is it so dark in here?

126
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,399
Weirdest thing.

127
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,039
Right after the lady tossed the kid,

128
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,119
the whole zoo lost power.
We can't see shit.

129
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,599
All we got is emergency power
from the backup gennies.

130
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,159
That's why we called for Special Ops.

131
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,424
We need you guys to find her.

132
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,959
This place is creepy after hours.

133
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,439
We should split up.

134
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,399
I'll go this way.

135
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

136
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,105
Fuck you.

137
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

138
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,319
Everybody loves my baby.
Everybody loves my baby.

139
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,959
Ma'am, what's wrong with you?

140
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,879
He tried to run. He tried to run.

141
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,359
Can you hear me?

142
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,464
Why did you do that to your kid?

143
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,159
And we're going to...
Break, break, break.

144
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,661
What's she saying?

145
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,919
Break on through to the other side.

146
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,519
It's The Doors. She's quoting
a song. Jim Morrison.

147
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,319
- Oh, yeah.
- Doors.

148
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,519
Break on through to the other side.

149
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,839
Break on through to the other side.

150
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,999
Break, break, break...
Break on through to the other side.

151
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,479
Drugs, probably.

152
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,279
Or maybe she's just a big fan.

153
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,999
You guys get any statements
from the witnesses

154
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,079
who saw her throw the kid?

155
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,319
Only two.

156
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,551
People got out of here fast
when the power went out.

157
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,621
Who's that?

158
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,839
Oh. Gosh.

159
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,879
I thought he was finished.

160
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,559
He's been at it since
early this morning.

161
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,999
Did you guys get a
statement from him?

162
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,141
No, I didn't even realize
he was here till just now.

163
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,945
Hey, you!

164
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,141
Jesus.

165
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,067
Hey!

166
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,021
I wanna talk to you!
You stay right there!

167
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,588
Get me in there.

168
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,142
You stay right there.

169
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,508
Come on out.

170
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,839
Don't fucking shoot.
Don't piss them off.

171
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,229
Just get me out of here!

172
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,705
Oh, dear God!

173
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,110
Oh, dear!

174
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,759
Stay calm!

175
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,785
Don't panic!

176
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,519
Don't panic!

177
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,306
Just get back in here!

178
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,501
Oh, shit.

179
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,639
Good morning, beautiful.

180
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,141
Mmm.

181
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,559
Good morning, stinky.

182
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,679
You're the stink.

183
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,181
Hmm.

184
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,879
I don't want to get up.

185
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,111
Come on. I've been up all night.

186
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,079
Where's little stink?

187
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,879
Raring to go.

188
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,427
Mmm.

189
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,919
Go, Savannah, kick it.

190
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,599
Let's get it down here. Let's go!

191
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,104
Christina, you gotta run, baby!
You gotta run!

192
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,639
Oh, yeah!

193
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,959
Attagirrl!

194
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,064
Attaway, Christina!

195
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,260
Yeah, baby!

196
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,639
All right, Ralph, sign her out,

197
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,551
and she's off to Hanwell.

198
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,741
Is she drugged?

199
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,223
She's been sedated.

200
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,919
You know this lady?

201
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,559
Yeah, her name is Jane Crenna.

202
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,039
You got a name?

203
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,879
Joe Mendoza. She's one of my charges.

204
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,839
One of your "charges"?
What does that mean?

205
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,079
I'm a Jesuit priest.

206
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,439
Ain't they the priests
you always read about?

207
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,999
Dying in bed with hookers and shit?

208
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,559
There are worse ways to go.

209
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,919
Where's your collar, Padre?

210
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,679
I work undercover, like you.

211
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,799
Are you going with her?

212
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,959
He's here at the family's request.
They felt she needed a specialist.

213
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,919
Specialist.

214
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,599
Are you a psychiatrist, too?

215
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,039
No, I'm not.

216
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,439
Can you tell me exactly how she was

217
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,319
behaving when you first
saw her at the zoo?

218
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,799
Like she was nuts, that's how.

219
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,239
She's going to the loony
bin where she belongs.

220
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,319
When you arrested her,
did she seem unusually strong?

221
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,439
No, why?

222
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,999
No reason that would interest you.

223
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,079
But if you do think of
something more specific,

224
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,439
or if I can be of any help,
please call me.

225
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,624
Okay.

226
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,065
Do you think she's single?

227
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,661
Oh, shit.

228
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,359
No usable prints on the ladder
or any of the paintbrushes.

229
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,639
What about the security cams?

230
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,349
The zookeepers can't explain how
he let those goddamn lions loose.

231
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,639
Cameras were on the backup genny,
but the lawyers for the zoo

232
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,639
want a written request
for the footage.

233
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,799
Should only take a day or two.

234
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,223
I'm gonna find that
fucking freak painter.

235
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,310
I promise you.

236
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,479
Hi, Daddy.

237
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,839
I'm going to sleep now,

238
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,719
but first, I want to tell
you that I love you,

239
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,359
and I miss you, and I wish you
were home, and good night,

240
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,989
and I got a gold star
in class yesterday.

241
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,719
And I also love you, and miss you,

242
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,879
and if you're home in time,
I'll see you in the morning.

243
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,959
- Oh!
- Sorry.

244
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,260
That's okay. I'll get you another one.
Here, give Daddy a kiss.

245
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,399
Be safe tonight.

246
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,188
Sarchie. Hey, Sarchie? Watch this.

247
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,119
Lady's out of her fucking mind, man.

248
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,399
She's crazy. Out of her mind.

249
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,559
Why? What does it say?

250
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,519
She said that nobody's
been down in that basement

251
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,839
since it was painted two weeks ago,

252
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,759
but that's where all the strange
noises are coming from.

253
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,479
I'm so sick of these bullshit calls.

254
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,479
Waste of my fucking time.

255
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,919
Gordon, did you say something
about a room being painted?

256
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,919
Yeah, it was a basement.
This crazy lady down in Belmont

257
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,359
complaining about some
strange disturbances, noises,

258
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,919
shit moving around
on its own. Weird, huh?

259
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,999
And then today she gets
a call from her father

260
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,559
saying, "Shut the doors, the doors.
Shut the goddamn doors."

261
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,639
That's not so weird.

262
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,222
Yeah, but she swears it was her pop.

263
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,999
He's been dead for seven years.

264
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,759
She's a whack job, trust me.

265
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,750
Let me see that.

266
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,719
Nadler, you guys can skip this one.

267
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,119
We'll take the call.

268
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,031
Radar?

269
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,039
This is it.

270
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,542
I think the Addams Family lives here.

271
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,639
You know, the last time we
took somebody else's job,

272
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,439
you almost got eaten.

273
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,759
Yeah, if something eats me here,

274
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,750
feel free to say, "I told you so."

275
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,839
Salvatore Alberghetti?

276
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,069
We're from the 46 precinct.

277
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,621
May we come in?

278
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,989
Yes, please.

279
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,466
Sorry for, uh, mess.

280
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,599
It's, uh, much trouble here.

281
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,039
- You all, uh, sleeping in the living room?
- Yes.

282
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,541
We, uh...

283
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,380
Since worse, we sleep
by door in case...

284
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,119
No sleeping alone.

285
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,719
This is my wife, Serafina.

286
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,479
- The boy, Mario, he will tell.
- Hello.

287
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,119
Is nightmare!

288
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,159
Since a few weeks ago,

289
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,903
we started seeing and hearing things.

290
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,479
What kind of things?

291
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,879
Things moving and sounds,

292
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,270
mostly at night,
coming from the basement.

293
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,679
Come. This way.

294
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,599
Mama says, it's like the
whole house is possessed.

295
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,479
"Possessed"?

296
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,602
Gordon called it. She's a whack job.

297
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,679
She knows you don't believe,

298
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,519
but it's okay.

299
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,719
She says,

300
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,824
"Let me show you."

301
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,470
Do you ever change a
light bulb around here?

302
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,079
No matter how many times we get new,

303
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,867
they burn out in a few hours.

304
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,159
We get holy candles from priest,

305
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,822
but here, they no burn.

306
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,279
The candles won't burn?

307
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,359
No. We all try light them.

308
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,624
Many times.

309
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,111
This Jesus,

310
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,223
he came down off the wall and broke.

311
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

312
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,159
Jesus.

313
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,959
What the hell is wrong with it?

314
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,479
It's a cat.
That's what's wrong with it.

315
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,959
What are they saying?

316
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,839
They think

317
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,865
that down there

318
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,781
is where the evil comes from.

319
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,590
Excuse me.

320
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,359
All right.

321
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,039
Take the kid. Wait upstairs.

322
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,039
We are gonna go down and
check out the basement.

323
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,239
The bulb, it burn out.

324
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,469
No light down there.

325
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,225
After you.

326
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,991
Listen.

327
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,039
You missed your calling.

328
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,826
You should have been a plumber.

329
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,667
There. Look at that.

330
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

331
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,519
You wanna read him his rights
or shoot him while he's down?

332
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,319
You know, it stinks down here.

333
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,026
I'm gonna go get some air.

334
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

335
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,630
Watch your step.

336
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,799
Do me a favor. Get these lights on.

337
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,519
So these two painters you hired,

338
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,359
did they ever say
anything strange to you?

339
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,679
Tell you do anything?

340
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,919
No. They...

341
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,421
Barely speak.

342
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,399
Is one of them, no?

343
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,479
You tell me. This is his ID.

344
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,159
- His name was David Griggs.
- Si.

345
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,919
Did you ever meet him or the other
painter before you hired them?

346
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,279
No.

347
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,439
As far as we can tell,
the other painter

348
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,359
was the last person
to see Griggs alive.

349
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,147
So, did you ever get
a good look at him?

350
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,621
No.

351
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,910
Wore a hood.

352
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,079
A hood?

353
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,359
Dark.

354
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,464
Part of jacket.

355
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,747
F12. This is it.

356
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,781
Shit.

357
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,639
Griggs and Jane Crenna,

358
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,222
the lady from the zoo.

359
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,346
Sarch.

360
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,386
Griggs, body in the basement.

361
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,709
Jimmy, the wife-beater.

362
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,787
There.

363
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,662
That's the guy we're looking for.

364
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,825
Santino.

365
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

366
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,182
Oh, sweet Mary, that is sick.

367
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,639
- There you go, princess.
- Thanks, Daddy.

368
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,559
Christina, here's your toast.

369
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,744
Why doesn't Daddy
go to church with us?

370
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,719
Legend has it, your daddy used
to go before we were married.

371
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,268
Did Grandma make you
go when you were little?

372
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,759
I go Christmas and Easter. Doesn't
that pretty much cover it, anyway?

373
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,625
Christina, go wait for me in the car.

374
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,119
Bye, Daddy.

375
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,826
Bye.

376
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,906
I'm pregnant.

377
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,266
That's great.

378
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,341
Are you sure?

379
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,426
Yeah.

380
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,319
When did you find out?

381
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,919
A week ago.

382
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,344
A week? Why didn't you tell me?

383
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,031
You've been working a lot. It's okay.

384
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,829
Hey, honey...

385
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,786
I'm sorry. I'm happy. I am.

386
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,145
I'm so happy.

387
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,759
I know.

388
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,959
More time at home.

389
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,199
I understand the hours
you got to work,

390
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,749
but even when you're here,
you're not here.

391
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,428
I get it. I do.

392
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,660
I do.

393
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,865
I'm sorry.

394
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,066
I love you.

395
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,310
I love you.

396
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,199
Hey. Give me another one of these.

397
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,679
This one's full of static.

398
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,119
I also got that surveillance
video you requested.

399
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,679
Great. Set it up.

400
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,319
- Sign it out with Smith.
- Okay.

401
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,839
Hey.

402
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,399
Hey. Zoo clips are
in the comm center.

403
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,239
"Zoo clips"? Sounds like
my favorite porn site.

404
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,999
- Let's go.
- Go ahead. I'll meet you there.

405
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,679
What can I do for you, Father?

406
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,039
You must be Catholic.

407
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,999
It's the second time
you've called me Father.

408
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,799
I was an altar boy at Saint Ignatius.

409
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,159
I was raised Catholic.

410
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,279
Past tense.

411
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,719
Yeah, I guess I outgrew all that.

412
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,585
You outgrew God?

413
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,959
What do you want?

414
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,639
I came to see if you've made any
progress in Jane Crenna's case.

415
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,439
What makes you think
the case is still open?

416
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,599
Well, I went to the zoo

417
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,199
and asked them to let me see
the security camera recordings,

418
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,180
and they told me only the arresting
officers had permission for that.

419
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,559
Why do you want to
see the recordings?

420
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,479
To help me determine why Jane did it.

421
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,919
I can save you the time.

422
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,279
The reason she hurt her kid is
because she's fucking crazy,

423
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,359
and now, she's in the loony
bin where she belongs.

424
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,639
Jane Crenna is no lunatic.

425
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,959
You kidding me? I was there.

426
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,399
And I've known her for years.

427
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,839
Well, how do you
explain what she did?

428
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,919
That's not the issue here.

429
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,999
I just want to see the recordings.

430
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,585
No, you explain to me why
you think she's not crazy.

431
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,639
I believe Jane's problem
to be spiritual in nature.

432
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,346
I knew it.

433
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,279
I've experienced two types of evil

434
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,359
in this life, Officer Sarchie.

435
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,879
Secondary evil, the evil that men do.

436
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,599
I'm sure you know all about that.

437
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,079
I've seen enough.

438
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,199
And primary evil,

439
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,759
which is something else entirely.

440
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,959
Meaning what?

441
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,919
I'm sure you remember
that in Catholic teaching,

442
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,879
there are very specific signs that
indicate the presence of an evil spirit.

443
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,031
Well, Jane is demonstrating
many of them.

444
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,549
You think she's possessed?

445
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,479
I'm sorry, Padre,
but I think it's ridiculous

446
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,599
to blame invisible fairies
for the bad shit people do.

447
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,079
Okay? I've seen some horrible things

448
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,821
but nothing that can't be
explained by human nature.

449
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,064
Then you haven't seen true evil.

450
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,070
Look, Officer, I'm only here
because I care about Jane.

451
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,479
So if you see something
strange or inexplicable

452
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,666
on those recordings,
please call me. I need to know.

453
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,830
Okay, Father.

454
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,861
What you got?

455
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,548
Military files. DOD sent them over.

456
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,719
Name is Mick Santino.

457
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,239
Both he and our wife-beater Jimmy

458
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,079
served in Griggs' platoon in Iraq.

459
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,599
All three were
dishonorably discharged.

460
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,039
Why?

461
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,951
They attacked the battalion chaplain.

462
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,279
Chaplain?

463
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,439
Yeah, they cut him up pretty good.

464
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,279
All three served time
in the brig at Quantico

465
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,359
before the Corps cut them loose.

466
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,999
So does the Corps got a home
address on record for Santino?

467
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,679
Nope, just an old PO
box that's no longer his.

468
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,919
What about Jane Crenna?

469
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,039
That's Griggs' wife.

470
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,639
And the kid she tossed
at the zoo was theirs.

471
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,711
Look at this.
It's Griggs' autopsy report.

472
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,719
Suicide?

473
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,639
Yep. Griggs guzzled two
quarts of paint thinner

474
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,666
with no sign he was forced.

475
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,319
Now, he didn't wrap himself
up in the drop cloth,

476
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,868
and Santino was the
only one down there.

477
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:45,465
So, Santino watches Griggs kill
himself down in the basement.

478
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,079
Then later watches Griggs'
wife try and kill her own kid?

479
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,519
Yeah.

480
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,431
He's a bad influence.

481
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,991
What's that writing on the back wall?

482
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,988
Graffiti? Maybe he was
brought in to paint over it.

483
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,559
Graffiti in a lion's den?

484
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,061
Hmm.

485
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,184
She knew Santino.

486
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,024
So what was she doing there?

487
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,759
Look at him.

488
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,546
It's like nothing ever happened.

489
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,559
You hear that?

490
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,919
What?

491
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,439
Static.

492
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,181
It's like a bad connection.

493
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,471
I don't hear anything.

494
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,741
You hear that?

495
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,546
Hear what, man? There's nothing.

496
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,079
You didn't hear anything?
No static, no other voices?

497
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,239
Don't get nutty on me, Sarch.

498
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,504
There's no sound here.
These clips are silent.

499
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,781
You're fucking with me.
I can tell. You're a bad actor.

500
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,519
That's when I called out to him.

501
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,431
He's about to move behind the trees.

502
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,519
Son of a bitch knew
we'd be watching this.

503
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,021
Jeez.

504
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,903
That is just creepy.

505
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,306
Bullshit.

506
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,639
Is he fucking talking to the lion?

507
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

508
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,110
Don't tell me you didn't see that.

509
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,500
Are you okay?

510
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,239
We missed you at the game today.

511
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,479
I had something to do.

512
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,319
Mommy took me to Grandma's
house afierschooL

513
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,479
and I got a new stuffed
Angel Owl for my birthday!

514
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,839
And look!

515
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,261
Did she eat too much sugar?

516
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,479
Ma gave her some cupcakes.

517
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,599
"Some"?

518
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,999
Two. It's her birthday, Ralph.

519
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,039
Well, the party's Saturday.

520
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,319
What, your mother couldn't wait?

521
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,079
Why don't you get your butt off my
mother's couch when you say that?

522
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,105
Christina, settle down.

523
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,079
What's wrong?
Still that thing at the zoo?

524
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,879
- No.
- The zoo? Daddy, I wanna go to the zoo.

525
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,359
- I don't know.
- Daddy, look at me.

526
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,799
Daddy? Look at me!

527
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,790
Christina, will you shut up!

528
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,159
What the hell was that?

529
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,399
You never talk to her like that.

530
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,426
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, Jen! Okay?

531
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,710
I got a guy

532
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,999
who beats his wife's face in,
in front of their kid,

533
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,707
and the next day he's back home.

534
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,999
All right.

535
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,743
I got a lady who throws
her kid into a ravine.

536
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,829
You want another one? Hmm?

537
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,711
Last week, an alleyway off Buck
Street, first call of the night,

538
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,626
I pull a baby out of the
bottom of a dumpster.

539
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,759
I'm giving it mouth-to-mouth.

540
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,262
It's already dead.

541
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,439
Just a little, tiny,

542
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,959
dead sack in my hands.

543
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,747
All right? There you go.

544
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,463
That's my week.

545
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,665
You didn't tell me.

546
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,107
No. No, I did not.

547
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,791
You want to talk about it now?

548
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,599
I walk through the sewer every night.

549
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,547
I don't want to come home
and do it again with you.

550
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,670
I'll talk to her.

551
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,822
She'll be all right.

552
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,639
Lucinda Tratner?

553
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,222
Yes. I remember you.

554
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,063
My husband's gone.
Jimmy hasn't hurt me again.

555
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,519
Do you know these other two men?

556
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,199
Jimmy served with them in Iraq.

557
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,279
Why do you ask?

558
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,703
Sergeant Griggs is dead.

559
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,359
When was the last time
you saw Mick Santino?

560
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,719
Two weeks ago.

561
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,623
He and Sergeant Griggs,
they started a painting company,

562
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,719
and as a favor to Jimmy,
they came over

563
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,239
and started painting Jimmy's office.

564
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,980
Can you show me the room?

565
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,147
My husband, Jimmy,

566
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,079
sometimes he has these fits

567
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,901
where he claws at things.

568
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,519
One night I found him in the street

569
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,988
clawing at the asphalt.

570
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:43,621
Sometimes he digs at the floor
so hard, his fingers bleed.

571
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,439
Does he use any drugs?

572
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,639
Mental problems?

573
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,188
- Hallucinations?
- No.

574
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,919
I don't know.

575
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,679
He came back broken.

576
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,864
I don't know him anymore.

577
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,908
A few nights ago, he started
to scare me again, and I left.

578
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,999
When I came back the next
morning, he was gone.

579
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,104
I haven't seen him since.

580
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,199
What's on these drives?

581
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,465
Jimmy was a combat videographer.

582
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,984
It's all footage from the war.

583
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,231
Do you mind if I stay for a
bit, take a look at these?

584
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

585
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,351
Shit.

586
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,159
Jesus, what's that smell?

587
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,909
Come on. Oh, no.

588
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,359
No.

589
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,879
What is that?

590
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,879
What the fuck is that?
What the... Aah!

591
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,039
Shit!

592
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,029
Mick! Mick!

593
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,879
Holy shit!

594
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,239
Fucking bats, man!

595
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,599
Oh, my God!

596
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,719
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here!

597
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,745
Mick, let's go!

598
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,189
The fuck are you doing?

599
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,550
Holy shit.

600
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,919
Oh, my God.

601
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,581
Mick?

602
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,307
What is it? What is that?

603
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,119
Ralph Sarchie, 46 precinct.
I'm meeting someone here.

604
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,860
No one called me about it.

605
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,999
You a doctor?

606
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,343
I'm the supervising physician.

607
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,711
And the receptionist, it looks like.

608
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,959
I'm here to talk to Jane Crenna.

609
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,919
Sorry, but that patient
is heavily medicated.

610
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,309
It's all right, Doctor. He's with me.

611
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,839
Hey, Father. Thanks for coming.

612
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,079
All right, 10 minutes

613
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,199
unless the patient is upset or
interfered with in any way.

614
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,986
Thank you, Doctor. This way.

615
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,959
What is this place?

616
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,905
The isolation floor.

617
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,509
Maximum security.

618
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,519
Upstairs is for the disturbed.

619
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,799
Down here is for the
dangerous and the deranged.

620
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,870
Jane?

621
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,359
You got a visitor.

622
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,430
Hello, Jane.

623
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,306
Do you remember me?

624
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,751
Do you know a man named Santino?

625
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,239
Mick.

626
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,391
That's right, Mick. Mick Santino.

627
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,186
Why'd you go visit him at the zoo?

628
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,386
Message.

629
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,508
He had a message for you?

630
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,919
Jane, what was the message
Santino had for you?

631
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,984
You speak Latin, huh?

632
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,222
What do you think of this?

633
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,549
Let go of my arm, Jane.

634
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,026
Let go of my goddamn arm!

635
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,541
Hey!

636
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,101
Shit.

637
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,466
Marvin.

638
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,199
Are you all right?

639
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,799
Gonna need a fucking HIV test.

640
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,359
I told you not to upset her!

641
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,639
Upset her? Look at my fucking arm!

642
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,159
Yeah, I'm on the phone
with your precinct!

643
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,559
I'm about to talk to your captain!

644
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,719
Yeah. Tell him I said hello.

645
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,399
You're okay. Calm down. Calm down.

646
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,902
You dropped this.

647
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,350
What's this writing mean?

648
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,066
Let's go get a drink.

649
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,479
What about this third photograph?

650
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,879
Where did you uncover the writing?

651
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,839
Inside the lion habitat at the zoo.

652
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,959
I went back there this morning.

653
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,239
These are messages to
the spirits of Babylon.

654
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,039
The images are Persian pictographs,
but the words are in Latin.

655
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,359
Persian and Latin?

656
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,559
Yeah. That's not odd in itself.

657
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,719
That mixture has been around
since before the time of Christ

658
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,079
when the Romans occupied
the Middle East.

659
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:24,879
But the Latin here refers to
providing a "gateway" or "portal."

660
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,959
So these messages,
they're references to doors?

661
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,319
Yes.

662
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,319
There must be an invitation
that opens a doorway

663
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,759
before an evil entity
can slip into our world.

664
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,439
Some people invite it themselves
by dabbling in the occult.

665
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,119
Others are just victims
of a curse, like this.

666
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,999
The message here provides a
point of entry for the demonic.

667
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,229
Here you go, guys. Hmm.

668
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,439
So you're not all pedophiles, huh?

669
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,559
Any other stereotypes you
want to hit while I'm here?

670
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,719
I've met a lot of priests.
You don't seem the type.

671
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,479
And I've known a lot of cops,
and you're exactly the type.

672
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,144
Seriously, why the priesthood?

673
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,959
I had a drug problem
when I was younger.

674
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,799
Bad one.

675
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,679
One morning, I woke up naked
in a pool of my own urine

676
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,959
in the middle of Kenmore Square

677
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26,022
with a dirty needle of speedball
still sticking out of my arm.

678
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,984
I had a choice, to live or die.

679
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,519
It always comes down to a choice.

680
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,439
I chose God.

681
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:39,104
I got sober through Narcotics
Anonymous and joined the priesthood.

682
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,462
You're sober but you drink and smoke?

683
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,719
I'm NA, not AA.

684
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,999
These get me by.

685
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,839
They might kill me slowly,
but they won't kill me fast.

686
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,069
Not like heroin.

687
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,305
What about you?

688
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,719
When did you outgrow God?

689
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,824
When I was 12.

690
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,679
Some meth-head frying his brains
out broke into our house.

691
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,359
He was in the same room as
my mom who was sleeping.

692
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,199
You know what stopped him?

693
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,799
God didn't stop him. I did.

694
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,719
With a baseball bat.

695
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,319
You see, Father,

696
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,719
as we speak, every day,
out there, someone's getting hurt,

697
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,871
ripped off, murdered, raped.

698
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,704
Where's God when all
that's happening? Hmm?

699
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,343
In the hearts of people like you,
who put a stop to it.

700
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,359
I mean, we can talk all night
about the problem of evil,

701
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,350
but what about the problem of good?

702
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,239
I mean, if there's no God,

703
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,879
if the world is just
"survival of the fittest,"

704
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,879
then why are all the men in this room

705
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,782
willing to lay down their
lives for total strangers?

706
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,301
Hmm?

707
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,221
I brought something for you to hear.

708
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,559
My first year in the priesthood,

709
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,439
I met a young single
mother named Claudia.

710
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,919
She was brand-new in NA.

711
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,919
She had grown up
Catholic in Venezuela

712
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,559
and was convinced that there
was an evil presence in her home

713
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,279
here in the Bronx.

714
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,199
As her priest, I began a ritual
cleansing of the apartment,

715
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,199
not because I believed
that she was right,

716
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,828
but because I thought it
might put her mind atease.

717
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,839
What happened during that cleansing

718
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,229
changed me forever.

719
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,159
It was actually the
event that started me

720
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,679
down the path to
becoming this sort of...

721
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,679
Specialist.

722
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,740
Exactly. Specialist.

723
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,599
I now believe there was an evil
presence in Claudia's house,

724
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,999
because I watched it try to take
possession of her daughter.

725
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,919
You'll hear three voices
on the recording.

726
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,799
One belongs to me,

727
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,559
one belongs to Claudia,

728
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:51,860
and one of the voices is coming
from a five-year-old girl.

729
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,079
Mommy?

730
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,999
Mommy? I want to make them...

731
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,279
Just please make it stop!

732
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,479
I don't like this!

733
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,630
Please, Mommy!

734
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,470
Stop it, Priest.

735
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,827
Eventually, it retreated.

736
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,025
It let the girl go.

737
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:01,039
And from that moment on, I devoted
myself to the study of demonology.

738
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:05,679
Every culture, every religion since
humans dropped out of the trees

739
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,420
has practiced exorcism.

740
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,559
Most of them are bullshit. It's true.

741
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:13,507
But maybe 10, 15% just aren't.

742
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,559
Besides superhuman strength,

743
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,745
each possessed person
used an altered voice

744
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,199
and had clairvoyant powers.

745
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,226
They knew things they
could not have known.

746
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,546
So, tell me,

747
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,546
who's Marvin?

748
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,919
What?

749
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,660
Marvin.

750
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,069
The name Jane mentioned to you.

751
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,069
Perhaps another time.

752
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,102
You play pool?

753
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,919
Sure.

754
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,399
You know, I think it's no accident

755
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,639
that you're the man who
discovered these messages.

756
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,639
You seem to either
be attracting evil,

757
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,239
or you're uniquely able to detect it.

758
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,079
Even if you don't understand it.

759
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,439
Tell me something.

760
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,919
Do you sense when something
bad is happening on the street?

761
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,479
I get hunches.

762
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,919
My partner calls it my "radar."

763
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,900
Maybe you have been
called into the Work.

764
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,279
"The Work"?

765
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,759
Yeah.

766
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,319
And if you have,

767
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,119
I feel sorry for you, man.

768
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,959
Hey. Don't feel sorry for me.

769
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,031
You're the one who
took a vow for celibacy.

770
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,821
Hey.

771
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,142
Christina cried herself
to sleep tonight.

772
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,799
What? Why?

773
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,319
Because she heard scratching
noises under the floor in her room.

774
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,559
Told her it was just mice.

775
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,079
Scratching noises?

776
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,424
Yeah. She was really scared.

777
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,159
She's not hearing mice in the floor.

778
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,707
I know!

779
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,639
Did you hear the sounds?

780
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,586
No. I don't think she
really did, either.

781
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:09,349
Don't you get it?
The floor isn't the problem!

782
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,869
She doesn't feel safe,

783
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,583
because she needs you.

784
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,505
So do I.

785
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:34,319
Something's happening to me. Okay?

786
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,391
It's something I don't understand.

787
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,119
You got to talk to me.

788
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,119
You know, I need to know.

789
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,827
You know, I can help you,

790
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,702
but you got to let me in.

791
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,839
It's nothing.

792
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,439
I don't want to talk
about it, okay? Not right now.

793
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,944
So, this is all I get? This is it?

794
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,119
You get the best of me.

795
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,860
Yeah.

796
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,505
I hope not.

797
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,599
I hope this isn't the best.

798
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

799
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,188
Jesus Christ.

800
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,507
The message he painted opened
a door for the demonic.

801
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,583
Those who are susceptible can become
possessed when they see this.

802
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,106
So you're saying by
seeing this message,

803
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,359
Jane became possessed.

804
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,039
Yes.

805
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,159
And then she tried
to kill her own child.

806
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,239
Why?

807
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,479
That's the mystery of primary evil.

808
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:40,507
Its destructiveness makes
no sense. Not to us.

809
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,039
Santino saw this message in Iraq,

810
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,146
became possessed.

811
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,599
Now he's trying to recruit with it.

812
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,879
What this man is doing
must be stopped.

813
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:54,159
He can't be allowed to keep
creating these doorways.

814
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,424
Take a look at this.

815
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,119
Tell me you saw that.

816
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,239
Saw what?

817
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,822
The face. It just flashed
across the screen.

818
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:21,999
No.

819
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,239
You didn't hear any of those sounds?

820
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,039
I heard nothing.

821
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,430
These sounds,

822
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,959
the static, the children's voices,
the wet thumping,

823
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,359
I keep hearing them.
I'm going out of my fucking mind!

824
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,199
No, you're not.

825
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,559
The painter in this video could
be sending you messages.

826
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,279
Perhaps he knows your gift.

827
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,439
My "gift"?

828
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,599
Those hunches you get,
what your partner calls your radar,

829
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,199
we call it "the
Discernment of Spirits."

830
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,599
You can sense what others can't.

831
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,519
It is a spiritual gift,

832
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,704
but it also puts you at risk.

833
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,944
It makes you a target.

834
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,839
Those Latin messages
weren't written in paint.

835
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,559
They were written in human blood.

836
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,381
We ran a DNA test, searched
the database and got a match.

837
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,719
Santino's got a police record?

838
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,879
Arrested for violent
assault two years ago

839
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,639
when he was home between deployments.

840
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,039
Acquitted and arrest record expunged
when the victim disappeared.

841
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,559
But his DNA sample was
in the felony database

842
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,143
along with a recent address.

843
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,879
Holy shit.

844
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,439
Right here in the South Bronx.

845
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,749
I'll see the judge about the warrant.

846
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,319
Hey!

847
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,159
No landlord around, no key.

848
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,071
Want to kick it in? Go in strong?

849
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,586
Please?

850
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,759
You wait out front.
I'll take the back.

851
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,069
We'll pop him when he shows.

852
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,679
He said he'd be there.

853
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,959
I know. Daddy's got a lot to do.

854
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:17,862
I'm gonna run your bath,
then it's time for bed, okay?

855
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,060
Mommy!

856
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,759
Christina!

857
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,039
- Mommy!
- Christina!

858
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,079
Christina!

859
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,070
Mommy!

860
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,839
Christina. What's wrong?

861
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,119
I heard scratching again,

862
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:37,590
and the door wouldn't open!

863
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,864
You're okay. Shh.

864
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,381
Baby.

865
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,221
Oh.

866
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,559
Do you have a crucifix in your home?

867
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,919
We're Italian. What do you think?

868
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,581
Good.

869
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,625
That's a start.

870
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,079
If you have been
called into the Work,

871
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,901
you and your family
are already in danger.

872
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,479
And now listen to me.

873
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,639
I can't help you any further

874
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,079
unless you humble
yourself before God.

875
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,319
What do you mean,
like a confession? Like in church?

876
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,039
We don't need a church.

877
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,621
We can do it right here.

878
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,159
You can call it confession,

879
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,159
admission, coming clean,
therapy, whatever.

880
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,279
Jesus.

881
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,559
This is spiritual evil you're
dealing with, Sarchie.

882
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,999
You cannot fight it in the usual way.

883
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,919
Whatever your sins are,
you need to face them now,

884
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,999
because they will be
used against you.

885
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,502
I guarantee you that.

886
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:35,239
I don't know, Father.

887
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,265
I can't do that.

888
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,279
Do you remember that
tape I played you?

889
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,239
Claudia, the woman from Venezuela.

890
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,469
How could I forget?

891
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,599
The night you and I first met,

892
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,671
I went to Claudia's house for
the first time in many years.

893
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,279
After seeing Jane Crenna that night,

894
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,101
I needed to see Claudia again.

895
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,999
To remind myself that an
encounter with true evil

896
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,628
can always bring out the evil in me.

897
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,301
What do you mean?

898
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,199
Less than a year after the ritual
cleansing I did at Claudia's house,

899
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,782
she and I relapsed together.

900
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,879
- No shit?
- Yeah.

901
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,384
Several times a week, for months.

902
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:21,070
No pain, no anguish,
no anxiety. Total euphoria.

903
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,864
And then when we
came down, we'd have sex.

904
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,067
She got pregnant.

905
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,679
And against my best efforts,
she had an abortion.

906
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,466
Jesus.

907
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,639
You're no saint, Father.
I'll give you that.

908
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,505
Funny you should say that.

909
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,159
Because when I couldn't
take the guilt anymore,

910
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,239
I confessed what I'd done.

911
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,839
And of course I assumed
I would be defrocked.

912
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,239
I certainly deserved to be.

913
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,504
But you know what my
parish priest told me?

914
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,439
He said,

915
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:53,547
"A saint is not a moral exemplar.

916
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,582
"A saint is a life-giver."

917
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,759
He heard my full story,

918
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,919
told me that if it happened
again I would be defrocked,

919
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,742
and I left his office committed
to walking the path of grace.

920
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,663
So I do know how difficult it is.

921
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,102
But you need to unburden
yourself, Sarchie.

922
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,079
You need to deal with
that hidden pain.

923
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,582
It's killing you inside.

924
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,159
Holy shit, there he is.

925
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,119
He's approaching the building.
I'll meet you around the back.

926
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,279
We'll go in through the side.

927
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,759
Stay in the car.

928
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,119
Sarchie.

929
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,951
Don't be deceived by his tricks.

930
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,505
He's not here.

931
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,990
What is it? What's wrong?

932
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,679
You don't hear nothing?

933
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,306
No.

934
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,990
Do you hear something?

935
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,661
Radar.

936
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Sarch, that's just the alarm.

937
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,559
Son of a bitch!

938
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,028
Radio the floor he stops on!

939
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,182
Basement, he's in the basement!

940
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:37,226
No, please,

941
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,311
help me.

942
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,825
Help me.

943
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,599
Okay, push.

944
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,039
Are you fucking kidding me?

945
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,639
It's stuck, man.

946
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,426
No!

947
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,141
God damn it!

948
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

949
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,861
As a cop,

950
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,821
I've always had a pretty heavy hand.

951
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

952
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,541
Where's Butler?

953
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,159
I don't know.

954
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,039
Shit.

955
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,519
Butler?

956
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,545
No, no, no, no, no, no!

957
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,599
10-13, officer down.

958
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,119
Repeat, officer down!

959
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,039
144 and Rider.

960
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,719
- Attention all units.
- Butler?

961
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:36,039
10-13, officer down.
I repeat, officer down.

962
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,919
10-13, please advise. What's your 20?

963
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,679
Address is 144 and Rider.

964
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,909
Repeat, 144 and Rider.

965
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,599
If I'd gotten there sooner,
he'd still be here.

966
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,399
You know that's not your fault.

967
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,311
What else?

968
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,039
I've neglected my wife and
daughter for years now.

969
01:25:58,040 --> 01:25:59,879
Shut them out.

970
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,064
I put the job first.

971
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,900
I understand.

972
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,799
As a cop,

973
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:15,429
I've always had a pretty heavy hand.

974
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,101
Go on.

975
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,421
Oh.

976
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,862
I killed a man, Father.

977
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,986
Marvin,

978
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,744
the one Jane Crenna
mentioned back in her cell.

979
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,239
Yes.

980
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,359
Was he a good man?

981
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,879
No. He was the worst
kind of man there is.

982
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:46,519
Folks, listen up.
This is Marvin Scrimm.

983
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:50,308
He's wanted on 11 counts
of child sexual assault,

984
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,226
and now, two counts of child murder.

985
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,985
Let's get this guy off the street.

986
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,782
He was everything I hate.

987
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:03,869
And I feed off that hate.

988
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,381
She was six years old.

989
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,187
Same age Christina is now.

990
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,022
My blood ran ice cold.

991
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,839
Marvin, the sick fuck,

992
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:59,581
he came back to have a second look.

993
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,910
And that's when I saw him.

994
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,905
I had him under control.

995
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:15,039
But I couldn't stop the rage.

996
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,701
I was like an animal.

997
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,119
I couldn't stop myself.

998
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,543
I didn't want to stop.

999
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,469
No, please,

1000
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,300
help me.

1001
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,719
Help me.

1002
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,999
I just kept hitting him.

1003
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,582
Over, and over,

1004
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,430
and over.

1005
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,585
Even after he was dead.

1006
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,759
And ever since that night,

1007
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:04,185
I've had a darkness growing inside
of me like a fucking cancer.

1008
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,919
I can't control my anger.

1009
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,639
I can't talk to Jen. I just...

1010
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:10,630
Wrath.

1011
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:19,119
Are you certain the guy
you killed was guilty?

1012
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,439
Yeah.

1013
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:23,466
His DNA was on all the victims.

1014
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:27,630
I've tried telling myself
he deserved to die.

1015
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,039
But if that's true,

1016
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:33,783
why does this eat away
at me every goddamn day?

1017
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:38,119
Because even if he got
what he deserved,

1018
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:41,119
what you gave him wasn't justice.

1019
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,429
It was vengeance.

1020
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:47,544
And vengeance always
destroys the avenger.

1021
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:55,142
I absolve you from your sins.

1022
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:04,479
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

1023
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,141
Amen.

1024
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Mommy.

1025
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1026
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:08,959
This is Sergeant Ralph Sarchie.

1027
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:12,039
I need a bus and an 85 forthwith

1028
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,621
at Valentine and East Tremont.

1029
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,639
I have a jumper.

1030
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:17,471
Female.

1031
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,706
Her name is Jane Crenna.

1032
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:30,781
Jen?

1033
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,799
Jen, are you there? You okay?

1034
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,359
It was me.

1035
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,159
It was me who made her jump.

1036
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:40,150
Santino?

1037
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:44,439
Are you in my house?

1038
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,159
I need help.

1039
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:59,583
My house. Now.

1040
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,159
Get down!

1041
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,520
Get down on the ground right now,
or I'll fucking shoot you!

1042
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:14,229
- Jen! Christina!
- They're not here.

1043
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,102
They'll die if you don't find them.

1044
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,870
Where are they?

1045
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,421
Where are they?

1046
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:41,864
Tell me where the fuck they are.

1047
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,919
Let us in.

1048
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,865
Let us in, and we'll tell you.

1049
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:56,791
Let me in. It's the only
way you'll find them.

1050
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,021
Do it.

1051
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,239
Do it. Go on. Do it. Do it. Do it.

1052
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,039
Fucking do it!

1053
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:13,143
If you won't let me in...

1054
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,946
then your family dies.

1055
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,221
And so will you!

1056
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,559
Sarchie! Sarch!

1057
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:25,300
Go, go, go!

1058
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,159
Put him on the ground!

1059
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,583
Grab his arms.

1060
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:35,919
Hold still! Hold still!

1061
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,626
Get his legs!

1062
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:57,671
Where are my wife and daughter?

1063
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Where is my family?

1064
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:07,342
Fucking cat!

1065
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,941
Get him!

1066
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:21,028
Put him down. Put him down.

1067
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,039
This guy's not human!

1068
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,701
No.

1069
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,999
- Get his arms.
- Put your arms down.

1070
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,582
Get him! Put them down!
Put them down!

1071
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,879
Leave us alone.
I'll take full responsibility.

1072
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,030
Can't do that, Sarch.

1073
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,426
Do it.

1074
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,750
Go.

1075
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:04,079
We need to perform a full
ritual exorcism on this man,

1076
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,239
but we need time to prepare.

1077
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:09,079
We don't have the time. I need
him to tell me where my family is.

1078
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,239
Leave me alone with him.

1079
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:13,239
I can't do that, Father.
Not while he's under arrest.

1080
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:16,839
Do what you got to do.
Don't worry about me. I'll help you.

1081
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:18,119
All right.

1082
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,861
We'll perform the exorcism now.

1083
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:24,831
Get the fuck out of here.

1084
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,581
Read the responses only.

1085
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,199
There are six stages to exorcism.

1086
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:37,319
Presence, Pretense, Breakpoint,
Voice, Clash and Expulsion.

1087
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:40,199
During each stage, you will do
exactly as I say and nothing else.

1088
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,959
Don't talk to it. Don't listen to it.

1089
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:45,439
Just read and pray.
Do you understand?

1090
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,941
Yeah, I got it.

1091
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:55,030
"Is everybody in? Is everybody in?

1092
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:59,306
"Is everybody in?

1093
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,780
"The ceremony is about to begin."

1094
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:09,501
Yes. Let's begin.

1095
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:19,159
"Glorious prince of
the Heavenly Host,

1096
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:20,919
"Saint Michael the Archangel,

1097
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,039
"defend us now in this conflict

1098
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,199
"against the rulers of
this world of darkness,

1099
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:28,559
"against the spirits of
wickedness in high places!"

1100
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:32,039
"Come to the rescue of men,
whom God has created in His likeness,

1101
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:33,919
"and has redeemed from
the tyranny of evil."

1102
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:36,239
"I rebuke thee, devil!"

1103
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:40,839
"In the name of Dominus, depart."

1104
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:43,422
"The Lord be with you."

1105
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,999
"And also with, with you."

1106
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,679
What you're feeling is the
Presence, the first stage.

1107
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:51,919
It's a deep psychological terror.

1108
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:54,787
Don't give in to it.
It will pass in a moment.

1109
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:00,639
"Let God arise! And let
his enemies be banished!

1110
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:04,519
"And let them that hate Him
flee before his face!"

1111
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:07,439
"As wax melteth before the fire,

1112
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:11,831
"so let the wicked perish
at the presence of God!"

1113
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,543
Are you okay? Can you continue?

1114
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:34,426
I... Yes...

1115
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,719
What's happening?

1116
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:48,199
Who are you people?
What am I doing here?

1117
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:51,079
Is that it? Is it over?

1118
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:53,981
No. This is the Pretense.

1119
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:57,279
The demon is trying to hide behind

1120
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,239
the personality of the possessed.

1121
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:05,429
"In the name of Jesus, we refuse and
rebuke this evil sent against us."

1122
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,380
"O Father in Heaven, so be it."

1123
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,707
Tell me your name, demon.

1124
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:18,839
God knows your name!
Knows your number!

1125
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,519
His mark is upon you!

1126
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,439
God beckons you to depart!

1127
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:25,399
Now! Now! Now! Now!

1128
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,662
Oh, my fuck.

1129
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,279
This is the Breakpoint.

1130
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,359
What does that mean?

1131
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,749
We're about to hear the Voice.

1132
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:24,941
Your name, demon. Tell me your name.

1133
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:30,188
Jane Crenna... Mendoza.

1134
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,390
Is Jane Crenna dead?

1135
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,759
Is Jane Crenna dead?

1136
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:49,944
I killed Jane, just like I'm
going to kill your son.

1137
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:58,065
You have a son.

1138
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:06,919
Claudia kept the baby.

1139
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:09,821
No.

1140
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:13,911
He too will be mine.

1141
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,866
You liar. You're a liar.

1142
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:21,439
You're a liar!
You're a fucking liar! No!

1143
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,279
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1144
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,959
Listen to me! Stop! Stop!

1145
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:30,919
Listen! I don't know what
he just said to you,

1146
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:34,039
but you're doing exactly
what you told me not to do!

1147
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:39,399
You're talking to it! Stop! Focus.

1148
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,665
You hear me? Focus.

1149
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:02,187
By the authority of our Lord,

1150
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:10,279
and in His holy name,

1151
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:11,759
I command you, demon...

1152
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,719
I brought it out of you,
didn't I, Priest?

1153
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:14,799
Silence.

1154
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,079
I brought out the beast.

1155
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:20,710
Silence. Silence.

1156
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:27,781
I command you to tell
me what I shall call you.

1157
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Your name, demon?

1158
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,879
Jungler, Jungler, Jungler.

1159
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:00,999
What is it?

1160
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,911
You didn't hear that?

1161
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:08,679
My name is the Jungler.

1162
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:13,479
Do you hear the Voice?
Is it giving you a name? What is it?

1163
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:14,879
- What is it?
- Says it's called...

1164
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,879
- Jungler.
- "Jungler."

1165
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:21,239
Jungler! You have been vanquished
by the blood of Christ!

1166
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:23,679
And by the authority of that blood,

1167
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:26,399
I command you to depart
this servant of God!

1168
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:29,119
Desist, Jungler! You know your peril

1169
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:31,959
is imminent, and your end is near!

1170
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:35,959
Desist! Desist! Desist!

1171
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:40,879
Get ready.

1172
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:42,839
For fucking what?

1173
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:46,119
The fifth stage, the Clash.

1174
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:50,079
What is it?

1175
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,911
Music!

1176
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:53,781
<i>Break on through, oh!</i>

1177
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:56,101
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

1178
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:03,799
"By the precious blood of Christ,

1179
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:08,430
"we command you to depart and
go where the Lord sends you!"

1180
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:13,268
Hold him down!

1181
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:31,984
"Holy Cross, be my light,
let not the dragon be my guide."

1182
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:55,199
Be gone, demon!

1183
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,279
By the authority of Christ,

1184
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:01,102
and by His power alone,
I cast you out!

1185
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:02,999
I cast you out! I cast you out!

1186
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,079
<i>Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!</i>

1187
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:06,919
I cast you out!

1188
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:40,185
That's Expulsion. The beast is gone.

1189
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:44,063
The beast is gone.

1190
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:03,624
Tell me, please, where are they?

1191
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:18,199
Hey. What child is presented in
this home today for holy baptism?

1192
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:20,319
Daniella Ann Sarchie.

1193
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:23,719
And who presents this
child to be baptized?

1194
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:26,199
Jennifer and Ralph Sarchie.

1195
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:32,343
Ralph Sarchie, do you renounce
Satan and all of his works?

1196
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,999
I do renounce him.

1197
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,359
All his works, and all his ways.

1198
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,385
I renounce all evil.

1199
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,119
<i>You know the day destroys the night</i>

1200
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:53,519
<i>Night divides the day</i>

1201
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:56,359
<i>Tried to run, tried to hide</i>

1202
01:50:56,360 --> 01:51:01,439
<i>Break on through to the other side</i>

1203
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:04,910
<i>Break on through
to the other side, yeah</i>

1204
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:11,959
<i>We chased our pleasures here</i>

1205
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:14,239
<i>Dug our treasures there</i>

1206
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:17,319
<i>But can you still recall
the time we cried?</i>

1207
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:23,270
<i>Break on through to the other side</i>

1208
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:51,860
<i>Everybody loves my baby</i>

1209
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,505
<i>She gets high</i>

1210
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:01,144
<i>She gets high</i>

1211
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:03,704
<i>She gets high</i>

1212
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:07,948
<i>She gets high, yeah</i>

1213
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,639
<i>I found an island in your arms</i>

1214
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:17,319
<i>Country in your eyes</i>

1215
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:20,039
<i>Arms that chain, eyes that lie</i>

1216
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:25,359
<i>Break on through to the other side</i>

1217
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,559
<i>Break on through, ow!</i>

1218
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:30,984
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

1219
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:38,839
<i>Made the scene, week to week</i>

1220
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:41,639
<i>Day to day, hour to hour</i>

1221
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:44,239
<i>The gate is straight, deep and wide</i>

<i>Break on through! Break on through!</i>

01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:57,839
<i>Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!</i>

1225
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,389
<i>Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!</i>
