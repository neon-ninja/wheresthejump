1
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:29,810
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider
Crawled up the waterspout</i>

2
00:00:29,878 --> 00:00:35,750
<i>Down came the rain
And washed the spider out</i>

3
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:40,721
<i>Out came the sun
And dried up all the rain</i>

4
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:45,192
<i>And the itsy-bitsy spider
Crawled up the spout again</i>

5
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,563
Jesse, you get in
this house right now!

6
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,031
Oh, Mom.

7
00:00:50,098 --> 00:00:51,465
Right now.

8
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:35,810
No!

9
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:52,059
Who are you?

10
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:55,096
Well, I'm Mrs. Voorhees,
an old friend of the Christys.

11
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:00,935
No, no. They're all dead.
They're all dead.

12
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:02,503
All right, I'll go look.

13
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,172
Please don't leave me.
He'll kill you too!

14
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,274
I'm not afraid.

15
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:13,714
No!

16
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,320
Did you know
that a young boy drowned

17
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:22,757
the year before those
two others were killed?

18
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:25,492
The counselors weren't
paying any attention.

19
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,863
They were making love
while that young boy drowned.

20
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:32,499
His name was Jason.

21
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:38,372
I was working the day that
it happened. Preparing meals.

22
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,975
Here. I was the cook.

23
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:44,444
Jason should have been
watched, every minute!

24
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:45,612
He was...

25
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:51,351
He wasn't
a very good swimmer.

26
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:55,923
We can go now, dear.

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,894
No!

28
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:06,567
My sweet,
innocent Jason.

29
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:09,403
My only child.

30
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:11,605
Jason.

31
00:03:16,678 --> 00:03:18,212
You let him drown.

32
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:21,515
You never paid
any attention!

33
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,418
Look
what you did to him.

34
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:28,488
Look
what you did to him!

35
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:40,234
No!

36
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:51,345
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her!

37
00:03:52,313 --> 00:03:55,415
She can't hide.
No place to hide.

38
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:59,153
Get her, Mommy. Get her.

39
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:00,988
Kill her. Kill her.

40
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

41
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:49,296
Two of my men pulled you
out of the lake. We...

42
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:50,764
...thought you
were dead too.

43
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:54,401
Do you remember
very much?

44
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:58,239
The boy.
Is he dead too?

45
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:00,307
Who?

46
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,909
The boy. Jason.

47
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,413
Jason?
In the lake.

48
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:08,249
The one who attacked me.
The one who...

49
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:10,417
...pulled me
underneath the water.

50
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:15,289
Ma'am, we didn't
find any boy.

51
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:18,692
Then he's still there.

52
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:38,779
God!

53
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:02,602
Hello?

54
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:04,305
Hi, Mom.

55
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,907
I know. I'm sorry.

56
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:09,843
I meant to call earlier,
but I fell asleep.

57
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,348
Really, I'm fine.

58
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:18,652
I need a little time
alone, that's all.

59
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:27,328
I know you and Dad worry,
and I appreciate that.

60
00:07:30,298 --> 00:07:33,633
Come on, Mom, we've
been through all of this before.

61
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:37,604
I just have
to put my life back together,

62
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:40,140
and this is the only way
I know how.

63
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,680
Look...

64
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:48,449
Mom, please.
It's getting late,

65
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:50,384
and I really don't
want to get into it.

66
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:54,488
I'll call you
tomorrow. Bye.

67
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:16,803
Mom!

68
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:19,673
Hello?

69
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

70
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,491
Oh.

71
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,574
Cute.

72
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:36,476
You want something
to eat?

73
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:37,544
Hmm?

74
00:13:56,017 --> 00:13:58,618
All right,
keep your eyes peeled.

75
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:00,553
I think we're
getting close.

76
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:07,761
Hey,
there's a gas station.

77
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:25,712
Okay,
let's call Ted.

78
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:43,263
Hey,
Teddy, buddy!

79
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,065
We just rolled in.

80
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:46,299
Yeah, yeah,
Sandra's here.

81
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:47,968
Hi, Ted!

82
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:50,370
Hey, so you gonna come down
and get us or what?

83
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:52,739
Yeah, okay. Okay,
give me the directions.

84
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:57,110
Here, wait, wait, wait. All right.
Okay, go ahead, I'm ready.

85
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:59,746
All right,
Old North Road,

86
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:01,614
and then look
for a Dairy Queen?

87
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:03,650
Okay. And then
over...

88
00:15:03,717 --> 00:15:07,020
I told the others.
They didn't believe me.

89
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:10,157
You're all doomed.

90
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:12,058
You're all doomed.

91
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,135
What?
Oh, no, nothing.

92
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:24,370
No, go ahead.
No. All right.

93
00:15:24,438 --> 00:15:27,207
So... All right,
covered bridge.

94
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:30,310
Okay. Then what?

95
00:15:30,377 --> 00:15:34,347
All right, so, then past an old cemetery.
All right.

96
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:36,283
And then...

97
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,719
Left down an old dirt road
for half a mile.

98
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:42,455
Oh, my God!
They're towing us!

99
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:43,824
Shit! Ted,
I'll call you back.

100
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:47,227
Hey, wait!
Hey, mister!

101
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:55,468
This is my truck! Come on!
This is my truck!

102
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:58,138
Asshole,
this is my truck!

103
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:02,742
Shit!

104
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:17,490
Welcome to
God's country.

105
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:20,693
You rat shit!

106
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:26,933
Thanks, Max!

107
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:28,468
Max owns
the gas station.

108
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:31,804
He's crazy too.
I should have known.

109
00:16:31,873 --> 00:16:34,274
It's great to see you.
It'll be like old times.

110
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:37,310
Yeah, that's what
I'm afraid of.

111
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:38,945
Help me load my gear
and we'll split.

112
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:46,386
So, Ted,
what's the scoop?

113
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:50,190
I know that guy Paul that's
running the course. He's okay.

114
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:52,225
He's kind of
macho, though.

115
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:55,262
He takes the whole thing
very seriously.

116
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:58,365
Senior
camp counselor, of course.

117
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:01,067
We'll probably all get a
Brownie badge if we survive.

118
00:17:01,135 --> 00:17:03,270
If we survive?
That's right.

119
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:04,837
Didn't I tell you you're
gonna be a second assistant?

120
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,173
Oh, no!

121
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,277
Wait, listen, listen.

122
00:17:10,344 --> 00:17:13,079
A bear and a rabbit are in the woods.
Both are taking a dump.

123
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:14,915
The bear looks down
at the rabbit and says,

124
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:18,318
"Excuse me, Mr. Rabbit,
does shit stick to your fur?"

125
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:20,887
The rabbit says,
"No, Mr. Bear."

126
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,956
So the bear wiped his
ass with the rabbit.

127
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,527
What the heck
is that?

128
00:17:39,106 --> 00:17:40,840
Where did this sucker
come from?

129
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:43,043
I don't know.
Let's move it.

130
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:48,581
This place is spooky.

131
00:17:50,784 --> 00:17:52,585
It looks like
somebody dragged it here.

132
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:54,421
Yeah, but
what for?

133
00:18:08,102 --> 00:18:10,236
Hey, you guys,
look at this.

134
00:18:16,944 --> 00:18:18,544
It's Camp Blood.

135
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:20,646
This place is on the same
lake as we're gonna be.

136
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:22,215
Camp Blood?

137
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:23,649
Isn't that the place...
Let's get out of here.

138
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:25,352
Can't we take a look? No way.

139
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:26,686
What's the problem?

140
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:28,421
You don't wanna hear about it, man.
Believe me.

141
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:30,023
Not before lunch.

142
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:24,877
Need some help?
Oh. Uh...

143
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:27,980
No, it's okay. I got it.
Thanks, anyhow.

144
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:51,438
Ow!

145
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:09,889
Okay, let's
settle down.

146
00:20:09,957 --> 00:20:13,126
It's great to have you here at our
new counselor training center.

147
00:20:13,194 --> 00:20:16,496
You've all worked as counselors
at one camp or another.

148
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:18,931
Terry, Vickie, you were
upstate last summer, right?

149
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:22,068
Scott! Hi! Good to see you here, buddy.
You need it.

150
00:20:23,537 --> 00:20:27,140
And, Mark, I know we worked a
season or two together, right?

151
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,210
Okay. The rest of you I'm sure
I'll get to know soon enough.

152
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:32,945
I'm also sure there's one thing
I don't have to tell you.

153
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:36,449
Being a counselor isn't the gravy
summer job everybody thinks it is.

154
00:20:57,438 --> 00:20:59,606
And what we're gonna do
over the next two weeks,

155
00:20:59,673 --> 00:21:02,609
if the rest of my staff
ever shows up,

156
00:21:02,676 --> 00:21:04,644
is go back to basics.

157
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:09,982
Survival, first aid, boating,
archery, rifle range, all of it.

158
00:21:13,621 --> 00:21:14,621
What the hell...

159
00:21:21,595 --> 00:21:22,928
I'll be right back.

160
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:28,701
Hi! I'm late.

161
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:49,289
What is this crap? You're
supposed to be my assistant.

162
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:51,624
Everyone else
got here hours ago.

163
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:54,260
I said I was sorry.
You did?

164
00:21:56,197 --> 00:21:58,831
I'm sorry. Okay?

165
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:00,132
But my car's sick.

166
00:22:00,201 --> 00:22:01,634
You could have called.

167
00:22:01,702 --> 00:22:04,404
Paul, I tried, but your phones
aren't even working yet.

168
00:22:05,105 --> 00:22:06,506
Oh.

169
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:10,943
Okay, get your gear stowed
and help me outside, okay?

170
00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:14,447
Paul, look, the course
starts today, right?

171
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:16,482
Well, here I am.

172
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:21,554
And I promise you, I'll never, ever
be late again in my entire life.

173
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:25,157
Is it a deal?

174
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:27,793
All right, all
right, what the hell.

175
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:30,096
Uh...

176
00:22:31,465 --> 00:22:34,300
Ginny, I was starting
to worry about you.

177
00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:36,569
Bullshit, Paul.

178
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:57,022
Ginny, put your car
on the lot, okay?

179
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,058
This place looks
like a Burger King.

180
00:23:00,394 --> 00:23:01,994
Where was I?

181
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:03,696
You were about to give your "Let's
keep our shit together" speech.

182
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:06,132
Mr. Holt.

183
00:23:07,334 --> 00:23:09,402
Right, Ted. Right.

184
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,070
Okay, look, a few words
about safety.

185
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,742
Axes, knives, lanterns, saws.
They can all be trouble.

186
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:17,644
Their misuse is the main
cause of camp accidents.

187
00:23:19,246 --> 00:23:21,614
Take care of your equipment,
and it'll take care of you.

188
00:23:21,682 --> 00:23:26,619
Now, a word of caution about
our friends in the forest.

189
00:23:26,687 --> 00:23:28,988
Among other things,
this is bear country.

190
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:32,091
And contrary to what everybody
hears, bears are dangerous.

191
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,026
That means no food fights.

192
00:23:34,094 --> 00:23:35,361
Aw!

193
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:38,864
Change often. Food odors
cling to clothing.

194
00:23:38,932 --> 00:23:41,801
If you're a woman,
don't use perfume.

195
00:23:41,868 --> 00:23:43,936
And keep clean during
your menstrual cycle.

196
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:50,743
Having trouble?

197
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:52,211
You gotta
treat them gentle.

198
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,680
Just like kids.

199
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:56,382
Use a little of that child
psychology you're majoring in.

200
00:24:00,487 --> 00:24:01,721
Try it.

201
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:16,369
It's more fun using that
child psychology on you.

202
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:18,571
You're such a sucker
for it.

203
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:24,711
Thanks much.
I don't want to scare anyone,

204
00:24:26,814 --> 00:24:29,181
but I'm gonna give it to
you straight about Jason.

205
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:35,388
His body was never recovered
from the lake after he drowned.

206
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:38,858
If you listen
to the old-timers,

207
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:40,827
they'll tell you
he's still out there.

208
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:43,129
Some sort of
demented creature,

209
00:24:44,498 --> 00:24:46,198
surviving in
the wilderness.

210
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:47,967
Full-grown by now.

211
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:51,538
Stalking.

212
00:24:51,605 --> 00:24:55,875
Stealing what he needs, living
off wild animals and vegetation.

213
00:24:58,445 --> 00:25:00,312
Some folks claim
they've even seen him,

214
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:02,314
right in this area.

215
00:25:04,384 --> 00:25:09,022
The girl who survived that night at
Camp Blood, that Friday the 13th,

216
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:12,692
she claims
she saw him.

217
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:16,930
She disappeared
two months later.

218
00:25:18,131 --> 00:25:19,432
Vanished.

219
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:22,969
Blood was
everywhere.

220
00:25:24,905 --> 00:25:27,373
No one knows
what happened to her.

221
00:25:30,978 --> 00:25:35,682
Legend has it that Jason saw his
mother beheaded that night,

222
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:37,750
and he took
his revenge.

223
00:25:39,352 --> 00:25:41,220
A revenge that he'll
continue to seek

224
00:25:41,288 --> 00:25:43,489
if anyone enters
his wilderness again.

225
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:52,799
And by now, I guess you all know,
we're the first to return here.

226
00:25:56,436 --> 00:25:58,270
Five years.

227
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:00,974
Five long years,
he's been dormant.

228
00:26:03,143 --> 00:26:04,777
And he's hungry.

229
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,380
Jason's
out there

230
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,784
watching.

231
00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:15,655
Always on the prowl
for intruders.

232
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,424
Waiting to kill.

233
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Waiting to devour.
Thirsty for young blood.

234
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:34,107
Hey, come back!
Come back!

235
00:26:39,212 --> 00:26:42,481
Okay, look, now that we've
got that out of our system,

236
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:44,517
I don't want to hear
any more about it.

237
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:47,654
It's ancient history. Jason
drowned, Mrs. Voorhees was killed,

238
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:51,290
and Camp Crystal Lake
is off-limits. You got it?

239
00:26:51,358 --> 00:26:54,393
Got you, huh?
What did you think?

240
00:26:55,896 --> 00:26:57,964
The second act
needs work.

241
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:12,712
- Too bad.
- Come on.

242
00:27:15,582 --> 00:27:18,918
You got him. You got him.
You got him now.

243
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,720
Go on.

244
00:27:23,991 --> 00:27:25,792
That's luck.
That's luck, all right?

245
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:27,326
Thanks a lot.

246
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:29,128
Next.

247
00:27:31,264 --> 00:27:32,965
Hi, Terry. Do you
wanna dance?

248
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:34,433
No, thank you.

249
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:37,937
Hi there. How about you?
Do you wanna dance?

250
00:27:45,645 --> 00:27:51,350
So there I was, sitting in this
fast-food joint, thinking to myself,

251
00:27:51,418 --> 00:27:55,988
"Scott, old boy, what are you gonna
do with the rest of your life?"

252
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:07,967
I'm striking out
all over the place.

253
00:28:08,035 --> 00:28:10,502
Well, I think
I've got you. Check.

254
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:14,006
Wrong, white man.

255
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:17,376
Checkmate.

256
00:28:19,713 --> 00:28:21,981
Well, what next?

257
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:24,450
I could get my arm
broken by Mark,

258
00:28:24,517 --> 00:28:27,754
my brains Ponged by
our electronical wizard

259
00:28:29,156 --> 00:28:30,689
or bed.

260
00:28:32,692 --> 00:28:35,461
Good night, Paul.
See you in the morning.

261
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:02,889
Jeff, I just gotta
see that place.

262
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:05,191
What place? That camp.
Camp Blood.

263
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:07,193
You're crazy.

264
00:29:07,261 --> 00:29:10,296
I've just got to. Maybe there
is something to that legend.

265
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:11,563
I'm serious.

266
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:14,167
No way. You're not
getting me out there.

267
00:29:14,234 --> 00:29:15,935
Besides, Paul said
it was off-limits.

268
00:29:16,003 --> 00:29:17,469
We'll see.

269
00:30:14,862 --> 00:30:16,062
Hello?

270
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:20,666
Who's there?

271
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:32,811
Paul, God damn it!
What do you...

272
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,014
Hey, hey, hey.
Calm down.

273
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:37,549
You'll wake
the natives.

274
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:40,253
I'm not supposed to be
fraternizing with the staff.

275
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:47,894
I won't tell.

276
00:31:03,843 --> 00:31:06,512
I missed you,
Ginny.

277
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:10,049
And I really was worried when
you didn't show on time.

278
00:31:31,704 --> 00:31:35,308
Oh, Paul, there's something
I think I should tell you.

279
00:32:23,774 --> 00:32:26,409
Come on! Come on!
What's the matter, guys?

280
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,810
Jeff, the women
are showing you up.

281
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:28,878
What's the matter
with you?

282
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:32,882
Hey!

283
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:54,036
We've got about a half a
mile, then we're gonna have lunch.

284
00:32:54,104 --> 00:32:57,940
Try to stay on this trail, because
there's a lot of poison ivy along here.

285
00:32:58,008 --> 00:32:59,275
How far are we
from camp?

286
00:32:59,342 --> 00:33:01,911
Hey, you guys,
don't trip on that.

287
00:33:04,548 --> 00:33:07,216
Mr. Holt. What are
we gonna have for lunch?

288
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:09,351
Ted's
probably gonna cook.

289
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:15,725
All right, after lunch,
we're gonna do some more running.

290
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:01,504
Here you go, Ted.
Thank you, dear.

291
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:08,177
Come and
get them!

292
00:34:08,244 --> 00:34:09,244
I'm here.

293
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:18,020
Muffin?
Here, girl.

294
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:19,956
Muffin.

295
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:25,127
Muffin?

296
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:27,329
Terry, lunch!

297
00:34:27,397 --> 00:34:29,064
Okay. I'm coming!

298
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:01,797
Jeff.
What?

299
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:02,999
You ready?

300
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:05,968
For what?
Camp Blood.

301
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:07,803
I thought we weren't supposed
to go near that place.

302
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:11,106
Come on, it's only a short walk.
They'll never know we're gone.

303
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:13,943
Jeff, I'm serious.
I really wanna see it.

304
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,411
Look, when we
get back to the city,

305
00:35:15,478 --> 00:35:18,113
we can tell everyone
we were there.

306
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:20,449
Oh, come on,
you chicken shit.

307
00:35:34,998 --> 00:35:36,566
Okay, let's go.

308
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,599
Okay, you guys.
I got one. Ready?

309
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:13,035
What's green and red and
moves 100 miles an hour?

310
00:36:13,103 --> 00:36:15,605
What? A frog in a blender.

311
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:17,707
Ha-ha. That
wasn't funny.

312
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:20,309
What's brown and
sits on a piano?

313
00:36:20,376 --> 00:36:22,078
Your face.

314
00:36:22,145 --> 00:36:23,445
Beethoven's
last movement.

315
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:24,914
Ew!

316
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,082
God.

317
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,187
This must be it.

318
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:06,421
Yeah.

319
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:47,863
Oh, my God!

320
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:49,065
What is it?

321
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:50,933
It looks like a dog.

322
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:53,468
It's too mangled
to tell.

323
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,304
What do you think
did it?

324
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:57,206
Wild animal, I guess.

325
00:37:59,509 --> 00:38:01,811
What are
you kids doing out here?

326
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:08,951
You're gonna have to keep your
people away from that place.

327
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:11,253
It's condemned.

328
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:13,622
Next time I catch anybody
there, I'll run them in.

329
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,358
He told us...
I'll handle this, Jeff.

330
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,696
I might just get a warrant against you.
Oh, really?

331
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:29,972
Look, Holt, people say what you're
doing with these kids is great.

332
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,608
You've got a
good reputation.

333
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:35,644
But if I was you, I'd have
located in the next county.

334
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:37,679
You're too close.

335
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,716
Things have been quiet for five years.
That's the way we want it.

336
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:44,220
So do I, Officer.
So do I.

337
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:46,956
Okay, you two, take off, and
I'll talk to you at dinner.

338
00:38:47,023 --> 00:38:49,091
We'll never
do it again, sir.

339
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,325
Thanks, Mr. Holt.

340
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:55,497
You're not even
gonna reprimand them?

341
00:38:55,565 --> 00:38:57,099
No punishment?

342
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,634
What kind
of place is this?

343
00:38:58,701 --> 00:39:00,335
Ginny?
Yes, Paul?

344
00:39:00,403 --> 00:39:03,639
No seconds on dessert
for Jeff and Sandra tonight.

345
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:09,711
You okay?

346
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:14,583
Should we tell Terry? You
know, about what we saw?

347
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:18,154
No way. As far as I'm concerned,
we didn't see a thing.

348
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,215
Hey! Hey, you!

349
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, my God.

350
00:42:46,662 --> 00:42:49,031
- Oh, no.
- Anybody want...

351
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,932
Who made this shit?

352
00:42:52,502 --> 00:42:54,903
Okay, people.

353
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:56,605
Today was fun
and games, right?

354
00:42:56,672 --> 00:42:59,574
I like to start
you out slow, ease you in.

355
00:42:59,642 --> 00:43:00,876
Tomorrow,
we'll get serious.

356
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,846
Anybody who wants a last night
on the town, now's your chance.

357
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:08,317
Okay, who else?
We only have two cars.

358
00:43:10,153 --> 00:43:12,454
By the way, our wanderers have
volunteered to stay and watch the camp.

359
00:43:12,522 --> 00:43:15,157
Isn't that
nice of them?

360
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,659
I think I'll stay too.
Muffin may show.

361
00:43:17,727 --> 00:43:19,694
Well, I'm gonna
go change, you guys.

362
00:43:20,796 --> 00:43:22,664
You know,
I'm pretty tired.

363
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:24,199
I think I'll
stick around too.

364
00:43:25,668 --> 00:43:26,935
Get me another cup of coffee?
Sure.

365
00:43:27,003 --> 00:43:28,470
Don't drink too much.

366
00:43:28,538 --> 00:43:29,804
Bye-bye.

367
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,042
Hey, you staying?

368
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:36,211
Yeah. Nothing spoils a party faster
than a drunk in a wheelchair.

369
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:39,548
That's crap. Look, we can
go together if you want.

370
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:43,152
I appreciate that,
but I'm in training.

371
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:44,653
Then I'm staying too.

372
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,854
Suit yourself.

373
00:43:47,857 --> 00:43:50,359
So how about it, second-in-command?
You coming?

374
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:51,593
You buying?
Sure.

375
00:43:51,661 --> 00:43:52,794
You got a deal.

376
00:43:53,663 --> 00:43:54,729
Got the keys?

377
00:43:58,334 --> 00:44:00,569
Beer time!

378
00:44:00,636 --> 00:44:04,173
Take it easy. Have fun.
I'll have a Jack for you.

379
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,274
See you later!

380
00:44:05,341 --> 00:44:08,110
Bring back
my truck in one piece.

381
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,878
I'm going
for a walk.

382
00:44:09,946 --> 00:44:11,880
We'll wait up
for you, all right?

383
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:21,557
Go, scooter.

384
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,182
Now I know how you can
afford tuition to grad school.

385
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:50,452
You always find some fool to fix
your car and buy you a beer.

386
00:44:52,088 --> 00:44:53,489
You got it.

387
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:26,788
Muffin?

388
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,363
- Here we are!
- All right.

389
00:45:44,106 --> 00:45:47,209
Everybody, get out
for some beers! All right!

390
00:46:41,998 --> 00:46:45,601
Come on, Mark.
Come on.

391
00:46:50,006 --> 00:46:52,908
You're gonna lose.
All right!

392
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,375
Hey!
Cheater.

393
00:46:54,443 --> 00:46:56,211
Okay, okay, okay.
Two out of three.

394
00:46:56,278 --> 00:46:57,545
All right.

395
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:02,784
Jeff, don't
wear yourself out.

396
00:47:02,852 --> 00:47:05,220
You wanna wrestle,
come with me.

397
00:47:06,856 --> 00:47:07,889
Later, scooter.

398
00:47:09,158 --> 00:47:11,026
Wanna take me on?

399
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:12,794
Sure. Have a seat.

400
00:47:18,668 --> 00:47:20,535
I only want
your fingers.

401
00:47:20,603 --> 00:47:21,703
What?

402
00:47:22,872 --> 00:47:24,840
Take your pick.

403
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:26,775
They're Ted's.
It's okay with him.

404
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,544
Football and hockey.

405
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:31,747
Which one
do you prefer?

406
00:47:31,814 --> 00:47:33,615
The one
with the puck.

407
00:47:34,884 --> 00:47:35,917
You mean hockey?

408
00:47:35,985 --> 00:47:38,453
Is that
what you call it?

409
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:40,956
Okay. What do you
wanna play for?

410
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:43,491
Position.

411
00:48:32,008 --> 00:48:33,909
Looking for something?

412
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:47,422
Come and get it.

413
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:49,390
Give me my shirt, Scott.

414
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:53,962
If I get my
hands on you...

415
00:48:55,131 --> 00:48:56,331
Scott!

416
00:48:59,668 --> 00:49:01,970
It's no longer
funny, Scott.

417
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,874
Help! God damn that Paul!

418
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,575
Him and his
wilderness bullshit!

419
00:49:08,277 --> 00:49:09,344
What can I do?

420
00:49:09,411 --> 00:49:11,113
Get me down, that's what!

421
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,048
I'll have to get a knife
to cut the rope.

422
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,050
Well, hurry, okay?

423
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:21,489
I ought to let you
hang, you pervert.

424
00:49:21,557 --> 00:49:24,592
Come on, Ter.
Give me a break.

425
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,861
You gonna cut
the crap?

426
00:49:25,928 --> 00:49:27,996
Sure, anything.
I promise.

427
00:49:28,597 --> 00:49:29,731
Okay.

428
00:49:32,101 --> 00:49:33,401
Don't go anywhere.

429
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:38,039
Very funny.

430
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:32,194
Where is she?

431
00:51:08,597 --> 00:51:10,732
Scott, I'm gonna
cut you down.

432
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:14,836
But I swear, if you ever do this
to me again, I'm gonna kill you.

433
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,438
Scott?

434
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:07,555
Look at this.

435
00:52:07,623 --> 00:52:09,424
I think
I'm in love.

436
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:11,926
No, no, it's just
tremendous affection.

437
00:52:14,497 --> 00:52:17,599
Are you sure you don't
want me to clear those?

438
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:18,966
No, I'm
collecting these.

439
00:52:19,034 --> 00:52:20,301
Have it
your way, honey.

440
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:23,104
I just don't want the bar
to fall down on you.

441
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:24,406
Thanks.

442
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:26,641
I think
she likes you.

443
00:52:26,709 --> 00:52:28,175
I think so too.

444
00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:32,380
This whole thing's
ridiculous, really.

445
00:52:32,448 --> 00:52:36,183
Two of our kids got hauled in
today, because five years ago

446
00:52:36,251 --> 00:52:39,921
some girl panics and falls
out of a canoe.

447
00:52:39,988 --> 00:52:40,988
It's absurd.

448
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,625
What if there is
a Jason?

449
00:52:43,692 --> 00:52:45,460
Oh, bullshit, Ginny.

450
00:52:45,528 --> 00:52:47,395
No, what if there is
some kind of boy-beast

451
00:52:47,463 --> 00:52:49,597
running around
Camp Crystal Lake?

452
00:52:49,665 --> 00:52:53,301
Let's try to think beyond the legend.
Put it in real terms.

453
00:52:53,368 --> 00:52:55,437
I mean, what would he
be like today?

454
00:52:55,504 --> 00:52:58,573
Some kind of out-of-control
psychopath?

455
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:02,977
A frightened retard? A child
trapped in a man's body?

456
00:53:03,045 --> 00:53:04,446
Let me out!

457
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:08,917
He'd be grown
by now, right?

458
00:53:08,984 --> 00:53:10,852
Right.

459
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,422
And, you know, the only person
that ever knew him was his mother.

460
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:17,291
He never went to school,
so he never had any friends.

461
00:53:18,093 --> 00:53:19,828
She was everything to him.

462
00:53:19,895 --> 00:53:22,229
Yeah. Deranged killer.

463
00:53:24,533 --> 00:53:27,769
No, no, no. You're
missing my whole point.

464
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:31,138
I mean, I doubt Jason would have
even known the meaning of death.

465
00:53:31,206 --> 00:53:33,608
Or at least until
that horrible night.

466
00:53:33,676 --> 00:53:37,144
He must have seen
the whole thing happen.

467
00:53:37,212 --> 00:53:39,246
He must have seen
his mother killed,

468
00:53:39,314 --> 00:53:41,382
and all just because
she loved him.

469
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,685
Isn't that what her revenge
was all about?

470
00:53:43,752 --> 00:53:45,386
Her sense of loss,

471
00:53:45,454 --> 00:53:47,789
her rage at what
she thought happened,

472
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:50,157
her love for him?

473
00:53:54,162 --> 00:53:55,864
Bizarre, isn't it?

474
00:53:58,266 --> 00:53:59,667
He must be
out there right now,

475
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:03,404
crying for her return,
her resurrection.

476
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:07,141
Well, what do you think?

477
00:54:07,209 --> 00:54:08,977
I think
you're drunk.

478
00:54:09,044 --> 00:54:12,246
I'll drink to that.
Hit us again, sweetheart.

479
00:54:12,314 --> 00:54:13,548
Not me.

480
00:54:18,453 --> 00:54:20,788
You know, Paul, I'm really
serious about this though.

481
00:54:22,124 --> 00:54:23,758
Jason's a
legend, Ginny,

482
00:54:24,627 --> 00:54:25,827
a legend.

483
00:55:15,143 --> 00:55:18,546
Your turn. Three goals
or you're gonna lose.

484
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:19,948
I've heard
that one before.

485
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:25,687
Mark, what happened that
you have to be in a chair?

486
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:30,091
Motorcycle accident,
paralyzed my legs.

487
00:55:30,158 --> 00:55:31,793
Is it permanent?

488
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:34,062
The doctor thinks so.

489
00:55:34,529 --> 00:55:36,230
I don't.

490
00:55:36,298 --> 00:55:38,967
I don't intend to be in this
thing the rest of my life.

491
00:55:40,168 --> 00:55:41,669
Just your legs,
huh?

492
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:43,170
Is everything else okay?

493
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,209
Oh, I do all right,
one way or another.

494
00:55:52,881 --> 00:55:54,448
Toke?

495
00:55:54,516 --> 00:55:56,584
I'm in training,
remember?

496
00:55:57,385 --> 00:55:58,686
For what?

497
00:56:46,468 --> 00:56:49,270
What does
the winner get?

498
00:56:49,337 --> 00:56:51,105
What does
the winner want?

499
00:56:51,173 --> 00:56:52,339
Guess.

500
00:57:00,182 --> 00:57:02,150
Want to stay
together tonight?

501
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:04,251
I was
just about to ask you.

502
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,188
My cabin or yours?

503
00:57:07,255 --> 00:57:10,825
Ted's in mine. I don't
think that would work out.

504
00:57:10,893 --> 00:57:13,627
We've got the whole camp.
We'll find our own cabin.

505
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:16,530
Just give me a few minutes
to get some things, okay?

506
00:57:16,598 --> 00:57:18,800
Sure.
I'll be right back.

507
00:57:30,212 --> 00:57:31,679
Oh, damn it.

508
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:37,384
Terry, you turkey.

509
00:59:47,482 --> 00:59:49,016
There you are.

510
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,439
Vickie?

511
01:00:18,947 --> 01:00:20,748
Vickie, is that you?

512
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:45,373
Vickie?

513
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

514
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,398
I looked up "ugly"
in the dictionary.

515
01:02:51,466 --> 01:02:52,699
There's a picture
of him.

516
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:57,604
I got to get some sleep.
I'm tired.

517
01:02:57,672 --> 01:02:59,240
You guys quitting already?

518
01:02:59,307 --> 01:03:01,308
Ted, you'd have me out
till breakfast.

519
01:03:01,376 --> 01:03:03,210
I'm gonna ride with
you, okay? Okay.

520
01:03:03,278 --> 01:03:06,080
Good night, Ted.
Good night, Ginny.

521
01:03:06,147 --> 01:03:08,749
When this place closes,
come straight back to camp.

522
01:03:08,816 --> 01:03:11,118
Yes, boss. And let Maggie
drive the pickup.

523
01:03:11,186 --> 01:03:12,552
Yes, boss.

524
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:18,058
Okay, let's
make a run for it.

525
01:03:19,227 --> 01:03:21,828
Move it!
I'm going! I'm going!

526
01:03:31,907 --> 01:03:33,673
This thing
had better start.

527
01:03:33,741 --> 01:03:34,909
You fixed it.

528
01:03:34,976 --> 01:03:36,710
I know, that's
what worries me.

529
01:03:47,822 --> 01:03:49,589
Are there any after-hours
places around here?

530
01:03:49,657 --> 01:03:50,925
Sure are.

531
01:03:52,294 --> 01:03:53,294
"Sure are."

532
01:04:02,137 --> 01:04:03,270
Mark?

533
01:04:11,246 --> 01:04:12,379
Mark?

534
01:04:17,118 --> 01:04:18,919
Mark, where are you?

535
01:04:30,731 --> 01:04:32,632
Is anybody still here?

536
01:04:37,272 --> 01:04:38,405
Sandra?

537
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,374
Jeff?

538
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,979
Sandra? Jeff?

539
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,553

540
01:04:57,492 --> 01:04:58,692

01:05:07,135 --> 01:05:08,768
No! No!

543
01:05:12,374 --> 01:05:13,440
No!

544
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:18,212
No! Stop!

545
01:05:20,348 --> 01:05:21,748
No!

546
01:05:21,816 --> 01:05:22,816
No!

547
01:06:03,591 --> 01:06:05,225
Nice night.

548
01:06:05,293 --> 01:06:06,960
Yeah, for a duck.

549
01:06:23,678 --> 01:06:25,279
God.

550
01:06:27,449 --> 01:06:29,849
What the hell are
all the lights on for?

551
01:06:29,917 --> 01:06:32,453
Paul, they wouldn't have
left the place like this.

552
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:38,792
Think something's wrong?

553
01:06:40,895 --> 01:06:42,696
I'll check upstairs.

554
01:06:46,901 --> 01:06:49,936
These kids smoke
better dope than I do.

555
01:06:50,004 --> 01:06:51,138
Paul!

556
01:06:53,808 --> 01:06:55,642
Yeah, Ginny, what...

557
01:06:58,613 --> 01:07:00,180
What is this,
a joke?

558
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:02,483
They wouldn't do
anything like this.

559
01:07:07,355 --> 01:07:08,922
Ginny, come on.

560
01:07:09,857 --> 01:07:11,291
Wait for me.

561
01:07:15,963 --> 01:07:17,998
Kitchen light's
still on. Must...

562
01:07:18,065 --> 01:07:19,899
Must be
the main fuse again.

563
01:07:19,967 --> 01:07:21,801
Paul, what's going on here?
Nothing.

564
01:07:27,675 --> 01:07:29,376
Where is
everybody?

565
01:07:29,444 --> 01:07:30,944
I don't know.

566
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,781
The rain's stopping.
We'll go look for them.

567
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:53,700
Paul, there's
someone in this room.

568
01:07:57,472 --> 01:07:59,473
Paul, there's someone
in this fucking room!

569
01:08:05,112 --> 01:08:07,581
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

570
01:08:07,649 --> 01:08:08,748
Paul?

571
01:08:08,816 --> 01:08:09,816
Paul?

572
01:08:14,322 --> 01:08:16,323
Paul? Paul?

573
01:08:22,263 --> 01:08:23,397

Please help me.

587

Oh, God...

588
01:17:51,966 --> 01:17:53,299
Jason!

589
01:17:53,367 --> 01:17:54,768
It's all done, Jason.

You've done your job well,
and Mommy is pleased.
