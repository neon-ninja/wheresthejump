2
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,359
from the very beginning...

3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,928
it was the children
who gave me my power.

4
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:41,032
The Springwood Slasher...

5
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,066
that's what they called me.

6
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:10,494
My reign of terror
was legendary.

7
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,701
Dozens of children
would fall by my blades.

8
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:22,138
Then the parents of Springwood
came for me...

9
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:32,155
taking justice
into their own hands.

10
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,358
When I was alive, I might
have been a little naughty...

11
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,196
but after they killed me,

12
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:43,692
I became something much,
much worse--

13
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,865
the stuff nightmares
are made of.

14
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,475
The children
still feared me...

15
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,606
and their fear gave me the power
to invade their dreams.

16
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:58,016
And that's when the fun
really began!

17
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:06,793
Until they figured out
a way to forget about me...

18
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,853
to erase me completely!

19
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,694
Being dead wasn't a problem.

20
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,963
But being forgotten--
now, that's a bitch!

21
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,203
It's only a dream!

22
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,730
Die, motherfucker!

23
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:25,006
I can't come back
if nobody remembers me!

24
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:29,379
I can't come back
if nobody's afraid!

25
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:37,251
I had to search the bowels of hell...

26
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,192
but I found someone...

27
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:43,993
someone who'll make 'em remember.

28
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:48,695
He may get the blood,
but I'll get the glory.

29
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:53,230
And that fear is my ticket home.

30
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:55,735
Mike?

31
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,511
Is that you?

32
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,148
All right, fuck you, then.

33
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,174
I'm heading in.

34
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,127
Mike?

35
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,195
Come on, it's not funny anymore.

36
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No!

37
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,700
Jason.

38
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:13,311
I should've been watching
them, not drinking...

39
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,338
not meeting a boy
at the lake.

40
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,144
I deserve to be punished.

41
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,677
We all deserved
to be punished.

42
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,418
Jason.

43
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,488
My special, special boy.

44
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,896
Do you know what
your gift is?

45
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,490
No matter what they do to you...

46
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,661
you cannot die.

47
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,193
You can never die.

48
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,765
You've just been
sleeping, honey.

49
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:46,871
But now the time
has come to wake up.

50
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:51,075
Mommy has something
she wants you to do.

51
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:55,347
I need you to go
to Elm Street.

52
00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:00,122
The children have been
very bad on Elm Street.

53
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,788
Rise up, Jason!

54
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,128
Your work isn't finished!

55
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:10,000
Hear my voice and live again!

56
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:23,373
Make them remember me, Jason.

57
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,477
Make them remember
what fear tastes like.

58
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:33,883
I've been away from my children
for far too long.

59
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,036
Marry, fuck, or kill?
Your choices are--

60
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,628
your choices
are the Three Stooges.

61
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,832
Go, Kia.

62
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,205
Oh, God...

63
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:25,370
Which one had
the super-bad toupee hair?

64
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,471
Harry, Mar--

65
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,311
No! No, no, no.
It was Moe.

66
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,216
Either one, I'd kill him.

67
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,344
OK, who'd you fuck, then?

68
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:34,684
This is stupid, y'all.

69
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,484
Come on. Come on.

70
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,649
Oh, God. Whatever, look.

71
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,181
I'd fuck the bald guy,
and I'd marry Larry.

72
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,456
Jesus. Is this what
we're doing all night?

73
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,861
'Cause, y'all,
this is really stank.

74
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,161
Hey! Gibb, what are you doing?

75
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,223
I thought you were gonna quit.

76
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,825
I only smoke when I drink now.

77
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,496
But you're always drinking.

78
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,164
Yeah, well, I'll work
on that next.

79
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:54,670
Hey, OK.

80
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,675
I got another one.

81
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,507
Fred, Scooby, or Shaggy?

82
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,911
Oh! I'm not answering that
and neither is she.

83
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,745
Do you guys think
I should get a nose job?

84
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:04,978
Oh, my God.

85
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,646
Oh, please, Kia, what you need
is a lobotomy.

86
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I think I'm gonna
get some candles.
I'm gonna get some beer.
Do you guys want anything?

87
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Are you sure you
should be driving?
I'm so under the limit, Lori.
Surprise.

88
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,964
Oh, Trey.
You answered my prayers.

89
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:26,995
Thank you.

90
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:28,975
Whoa, babe!

91
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,135
What'd I tell you
about kissing me...

92
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,474
after you've smoked, huh?

93
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,138
Lighten up.
They're menthols.

94
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,478
Yeah. I brought Blake.
Where's Linda?

95
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,914
It's Lori.

96
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,316
This is her house,
so don't be a total cocksmith.

97
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,341
Whatever.

98
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,182
Where are the ladies?

99
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,921
Relax, they'll be here.

100
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,485
I'm relaxed, man.
I'm just wet.

101
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,326
Did you know they
were coming over?

102
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,832
Listen, you gotta be quiet.

103
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,165
Hey, we knew you were be here
all alone this weekend.

104
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,172
Blake's cute.

105
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,072
He's not my type.

106
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,508
Oh! Who is? No one's
ever gonna live up...

107
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,535
to the fuzzy memory
of your first love, Lori.

108
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,377
You were fucking fourteen,
so get over it.

109
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,939
Yeah, I know
we were young...

110
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,076
but what Will and l
had was real.

111
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,110
Well, correct me if I'm wrong...

112
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,816
but didn't Mr. Real
just drop-kick your ass...

113
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,757
without so much
as a good-bye handshake?

114
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:22,489
He ever even call or maybe even
write to you after he moved?

115
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,791
Send you an e-mail?

116
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,161
No.

117
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,257
You see my point?

118
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,495
It's time to leave
the convent, Lori.

119
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,265
You need to meet a guy.

120
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,419
Hey, Lori...

121
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,723
I like the...
flow of your place.

122
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,695
Got good feng shui.

123
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,595
Yeah.

124
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,698
You know about feng shui?

125
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,107
Oh, oh!

126
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,110
Oh, you should see her bedroom!

127
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,942
-Hmm?
-Great flow in there.

128
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,710
Lori, why don't you go upstairs
and show Blake your feng shui?

129
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,081
Shut up!

130
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,047
I got a kink in my neck.

131
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,751
Come on.
You can massage it out for me.

132
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,118
I think I need
a few more drinks...

133
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,426
before there'll be
any massaging.

134
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,395
What do you see in him?

135
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,369
I don't know,
but he has a cute ass.

136
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:40,805
Babe, don't make me
ask you twice, OK?

137
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,342
So, Lori...

138
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,406
am I gonna get that
grand tour or what?

139
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,748
Yeah.

140
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,310
You know, why don't you
start in the kitchen...

141
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:55,514
and get us some beers?

142
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,920
Cool.

143
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,324
Oh, my God, Kia,
he is a total idiot.

144
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,352
Get him out of here.

145
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,661
Oh, Lori, come on,
give him a chance.

146
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,860
I don't like him.

147
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,869
You know what?
You don't like anybody.

148
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,632
I mean, Lori, you've
barely gone out since--

149
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,798
Since what?
Since my mom died?

150
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,535
Yeah, well, you know what?
My dad needs me.

151
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,566
So I can't just go out
with guys all the time...

152
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,910
and if I did, it would not be
with somebody like Blake.

153
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,516
Yeah, fuck me, baby!

154
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

155
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,472
Your back door was open.

156
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,599
I closed it.

157
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,074
Mmm.

158
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:27,546
Babe, you know I don't like
to be touched after, OK?

159
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,242
Fine. I'll go have
a shower then.

160
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,551
Good.

161
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,919
Your hair smells like
menthols, anyway.

162
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,652
Asshole.

163
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

164
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,414
Trey!

165
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,283
What the hell are you doing?

166
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,097
Help us! Help us!

167
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,837
Oh, my God!

168
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,107
Over here!

169
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,046
Please help us!

170
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,048
Help us!

171
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,413
You kids need
some assistance?

172
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,543
What the fuck
do you think?!

173
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,485
We need to lock this down now.

174
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,045
Keep it contained, you hear me?

175
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,613
Killed in bed.

176
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,387
Jesus.

177
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,861
It's even the same damn house.

178
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,386
1428 Elm.

179
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,262
It's gotta be him, right?

180
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,857
It's gotta be
Freddy Krueger.

181
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:28,868
Hey! Don't even say...

182
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:29,869
that son of a bitch's
name out loud.

183
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,098
Let's just keep it together.

184
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,606
We've been through too much
to let this thing spread now.

185
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,131
Take all the kids
down to the station.

186
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,700
Keep them separate.
Do it now.

187
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,143
Yes, sir.

188
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,441
We'll be in touch.

189
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,471
Thank you.
Let's go home.

190
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,652
So?

191
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:49,916
She doesn't know anything.

192
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,447
None of them do.

193
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,584
I'm pretty sure we're good.

194
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,685
Pretty sure?
You better make damn sure...

195
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,888
none of those kids
knows anything...

196
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,296
or I'll send your ass up
to Westin Hills with them.

197
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,731
Knows what?
What do you mean?

198
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,701
Good work there tonight, Stubbs.

199
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,828
Right place, right time.

200
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,771
But we'll take it
from here, all right?

201
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,746
Your father's on his way.

202
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:17,909
Do they know who did this?

203
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,010
No, not yet.

204
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,179
But I thought I heard...

205
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,916
one of the officers
mention a name.

206
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,548
You know, to tell
you the truth, Lori...

207
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,786
I--I just moved here
about a month ago...

208
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,226
but if they have a suspect,
I'd be the first to know.

209
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,025
But they asked me all these
really weird questions...

210
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,361
Iike about my dreams--

211
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,636
What was the name?

212
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,402
What was the name?

213
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,180
Freddy.

214
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,469
Hello?

215
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,250
Are you OK?

216
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,131
His name is Freddy Krueger...

217
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:20,936
and he loves children,
especially little girls.

218
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:23,568
Freddy's coming back.

219
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,238
Soon he'll be strong enough.

220
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,612
It's OK to be afraid.

221
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,742
We were all afraid.

222
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,276
Warn your friends.
Warn everyone.

223
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:49,624
One, two, Freddy's
coming for you

224
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,435
Three, four,
better lock the door

225
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:57,807
Five, six, grab a crucifix

226
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:01,678
Seven, eight,
try to stay up late

227
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Nine, ten, never sleep again
One, two, Freddy's
coming for you...

228
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:21,021
Blake, we have to talk.

229
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,364
What the hell were you
doing over there?

230
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,773
You were supposed to be
watching your sister.

231
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,334
Were you drinking?

232
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:35,347
My best friend was
just killed, Dad!

233
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:39,078
So how about giving me
some fucking space?

234
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,014
You watch yourself, boy.

235
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,336
I'm gonna get him for you, Trey.

236
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,703
Cop let it slip.

237
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,298
It was somebody named Freddy.

238
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:05,436
I'm gonna take him out
myself, Trey.

239
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,777
I swear to God.

240
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,326
Who is that?

241
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,163
Someone there?

242
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,569
Jesus.

243
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,115
I'm OK. I'm all right.

244
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,859
Not strong enough yet.

245
00:19:56,896 --> 00:20:00,388
Well, I will be soon enough.

246
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,698
Until then...

247
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,933
I'll let Jason have some fun.

248
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Dad?

249
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,170
Hypnocil.
What does this shit do, anyway?

250
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,839
How come we all
have to take it?

251
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,577
It keeps you nice and docile
while I kick your little ass.

252
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,679
I'm fine with that.

253
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,255
We interrupt this program
for a special report.

254
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,262
After tonight's murder...

255
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,127
in this neighborhood
of Springwood...

256
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,825
the Sheriff's Department
has confirmed...

257
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,857
that there is one victim...

258
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,163
Hey, turn that up, man.

259
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,262
Remain sketchy,
but the sheriff--

260
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,830
Sorry, Will.
You know the rules.

261
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:15,898
Turn that back on.

262
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,206
I know somebody
that lives in that house.

263
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,109
Come on, turn it back on, man!

264
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,443
I never ask for anything.

265
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,006
Just turn on
the fucking TV, please!

266
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,620
Fuck you, man!

267
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,815
What the fuck is your problem?

268
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,051
What are you doing, man?

269
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,423
You want 10ccs of that pink
tranquilizer in your ass?

270
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,052
That was Lori's house.

271
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,995
They said something
about a murder.

272
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,122
I gotta go to her.

273
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:40,792
I gotta see if she's OK.

274
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,892
Back to Springwood?

275
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,199
Do you want me to start
having nightmares again?

276
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:47,206
Don't start with that
dream demon shit again.

277
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,869
OK? You know that's all
just in your head.

278
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,277
Yeah, yeah, and who are you,
the poster boy for sanity?

279
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,302
You're the one
that told the cops...

280
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,940
Lori's dad killed his wife.

281
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,541
Yeah, right, and now it
looks like someone else...

282
00:21:58,584 --> 00:21:59,710
got killed in the same house.

283
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,276
You think that's
a coincidence?

284
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,845
Two murders in one house?

285
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,291
Kurt, how many times
do I have to tell you, man?

286
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,021
I don't do checkers.

287
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,052
I'm an UNO guy, all right?

288
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:15,033
So go grab the fucking UNO deck
and we'll play, OK?

289
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,466
Please. Thank you.

290
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:22,134
Look at us, Will.

291
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,199
Look around you, man.

292
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:26,234
We're institutionalized.

293
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,941
We're stuck here.
We're not going anywhere.

294
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:42,019
I do miss my family, man.

295
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:48,057
I mean, it's been four years
since I've seen 'em, you know.

296
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,000
All these years,
and you're still convinced...

297
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,401
you saw her father do that?

298
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,234
I know what I saw, Mark.

299
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:56,400
Fuck what the doctors try
to get me to believe.

300
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,433
I need to know if she's OK.

301
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,388
You want to play?

302
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,737
Sweet dreams, monkey boy.

303
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,779
What the hell
was that for, man?

304
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,615
Heh heh heh!

305
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,490
You're a fucking lunatic,
you know that?

306
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,052
I know you are,
but what am l?

307
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,274
Are you sure
you didn't see anyone?

308
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:12,409
No, Dad, none of us did.

309
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,386
I already went over this
with the police.

310
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:24,653
It's just...

311
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,631
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

312
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,190
You're all I have left.

313
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:32,030
Dad, I'm not going anywhere.

314
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,707
I promise.

315
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:38,039
Look at you.

316
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You're exhausted.
Lori.
We need to get you to bed!

317
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:49,112
I don't want to
go to sleep, Dad.

318
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,679
I just want to see my friends.

319
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:53,521
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to go to school today.

320
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,584
You've just been through
a very traumatic experience.

321
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:57,926
Dad, please...

322
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,488
I just need to get
out of the house, OK?

323
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:03,866
I'll be fine.
I promise.

324
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,044
Well, at least drink your juice.

325
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:19,883
Will Rollins
and the Davis boy...

326
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,819
escaped from Westin Hills
last night.

327
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,118
Oh, Jesus.

328
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,420
It's all coming apart again.

329
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:29,087
Don't worry.
We'll find them.

330
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,187
Keep this thing contained.

331
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:44,604
Lori!

332
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,976
Oh, my God! God, you guys,
I'm so glad you're here.

333
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,878
Blake's dead, too.

334
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,042
What?

335
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,382
Yeah, he--

336
00:25:56,088 --> 00:26:00,047
He was stabbed
to death late last night.

337
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,219
Same with his dad.

338
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,990
What?

339
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,000
Shit, shit!
This is bullshit!

340
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,558
The police are blaming
everything on Blake...

341
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:12,628
Iike its some kind
of Columbine thing or something.

342
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,434
They're saying he went crazy.

343
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:17,499
Killed Trey, killed his dad,
and then took his own life?

344
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,773
This is so fucking messed up.

345
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:21,336
This is messed up.

346
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,181
Excuse me. Sorry.

347
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,706
Lori?

348
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,218
What is it, Linderman?

349
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,720
Um, well, I heard
what happened,

350
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,619
and I just wanted to
express how, um...

351
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:33,250
well, to tell you
how sorry I was.

352
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,556
Thank you.
That's sweet.

353
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,495
Right. Actually if you need
anybody to talk to or maybe--

354
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:40,692
Whoa, Linderman,
let me give you a tip.

355
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,667
Place your hormones
back in the box...

356
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,293
and quit while
you're ahead, OK?

357
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,167
We don't have time
for Date-a-Dork right now.

358
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,365
Thanks.

359
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,370
Right. Sorry.

360
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,309
I swear, every day
it's the same thing.

361
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,902
He's like one of those
fucking froufrou dogs...

362
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,379
that keeps humping your leg.

363
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:58,548
Give a couple to some ladies.

364
00:26:58,584 --> 00:26:59,846
Thanks, man.

365
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:00,852
I see what
you're saying, Gibb...

366
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:01,910
but that's exactly
why you should go.

367
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,683
I mean, be amongst friends,
where it's safe.

368
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,019
There's gonna be a whole lot
of loving there for you...

369
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,218
and my boy Trey, all right?

370
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,954
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
I should go.

371
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,791
I could use a few dozen drinks.

372
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,797
That a girl.

373
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,628
Let your freak flag fly.

374
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:15,258
See you there.

375
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,290
You want to go?

376
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,235
No, I don't think so.

377
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,738
I--I didn't get much
sleep last night...

378
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:22,240
and when I did sleep...

379
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,901
I had the most
terrible nightmares.

380
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,104
Lori, you had to sleep
at a police station.

381
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,510
I'd have nightmares, too.

382
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,070
No, no, no,
it wasn't like that.

383
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,048
I mean, this was really real.

384
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,710
I mean, there was this man...

385
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,776
but he more like
a monster really...

386
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,185
and they kept
calling him Freddy...

387
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:38,019
-and he was so real.
-Shh!

388
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,422
What did he look like?

389
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,256
He--he had this...

390
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,125
dark brown hat, and...

391
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,563
his skin was
terribly burnt...

392
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,931
and on this right hand
he had this like these...

393
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,458
razor fingers, and--

394
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,799
You must be tripping.

395
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,997
No, no, no!

396
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,437
And then there were
these little girls...

397
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,270
It's OK.
It was a bad dream.

398
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,640
They were singing like
this--this song like--

399
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:03,808
One, two, Freddy's
coming for you.

400
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,942
You know why they sing that?

401
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:08,545
Because that's when
he comes for you...

402
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,555
in your dreams.

403
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,750
You're lucky to be alive.

404
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,019
Who is he?

405
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,617
He's a child murderer...

406
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,720
that some parents
from around here burned alive...

407
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:20,027
but then he came back.

408
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,398
Back for revenge
in our nightmares.

409
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,096
Funny no one ever
told us about him, huh?

410
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,365
-OK, thank you!
-No!

411
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:27,497
You want some free advice?

412
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,370
Coffee.
Make friends with it.

413
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,966
Mark!

414
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,170
That's enough.

415
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,236
You're scaring her.

416
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:41,446
Will?

417
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:43,648
Hey.

418
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,251
I thought you might
be in trouble, so we--

419
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,786
Lori! Oh, my God!

420
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,956
Lori, honey, wake up!

421
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,466
Someone get help, please!

422
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,093
Someone get some help, please!

423
00:28:57,136 --> 00:29:01,129
The principal!
Will, let's go, let's go!

424
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,936
Please, somebody help her.
Lori?

425
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,783
How much longer
is it gonna take?

426
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,446
-ls she OK or what?
-Shh!

427
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,284
Tsk!

428
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,345
For nose jobs,
what kind of anesthesia...

429
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,009
do the doctors use?

430
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,711
They put you
all the way under, right?

431
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

432
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,830
Got your nose!

433
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,500
Strong work, man.

434
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:12,669
I came to make sure she's OK...

435
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:15,043
and you put her
in the infirmary.

436
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,174
What were you
thinking about...

437
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:21,982
telling her
all that stuff, man?

438
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,249
I mean, we're not in group.

439
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,448
Because I'm thinking
for the first time in my life...

440
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,390
that maybe I'm not crazy...

441
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,915
that my brother wasn't crazy.

442
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,928
She had the same dream, Will.

443
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:31,930
Will Rollins!
Mark Davis!

444
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,774
This doesn't make any sense.

445
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,208
There's nothing on Krueger.

446
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:48,270
Not his arrest, his death,
not even a birth certificate.

447
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:51,043
Whole sections of
the records are gone.

448
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:54,382
Look at all these
blacked-out obituaries.

449
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,090
January eighteenth.

450
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:07,428
That's the day my brother
committed suicide.

451
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,457
Why isn't that in here?

452
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:14,167
I don't know!

453
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,538
But I'm sure there's
a good reason.

454
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,500
Remember in group
when they told us...

455
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:20,910
not to jump to conclusions?

456
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:22,106
Listen to yourself.

457
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,978
You're holding onto
that psychobabble bullshit...

458
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:26,576
Iike it's some kind of
security blanket, man.

459
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:30,247
Let it go.
They've covered him up, Will.

460
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,722
They never told us
about Freddy...

461
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,657
because that's how they
decided to beat him.

462
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:36,593
They treated him like he
was a fucking disease...

463
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:37,652
and they locked up
all the kids...

464
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:38,663
who had made
contact with him...

465
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,426
so they wouldn't
infect the others.

466
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:41,660
That's crazy.

467
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,168
Is it?

468
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:46,467
How come we were
never allowed...

469
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,973
to call any of
our friends, man?

470
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,407
How come none of our
friends ever called us?

471
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,469
We were in a fucking
quarantine, man.

472
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,981
That's what
Westin Hills was for.

473
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,381
Well, even if all
you're saying is true...

474
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,818
then why didn't
Freddy kill Lori?

475
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:04,414
Maybe he's not
strong enough yet.

476
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:07,084
My brother said it's our fear
that gives him his power.

477
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:08,457
Yeah, well,
you sure as hell...

478
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,985
spread enough fear
today at school.

479
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,020
Holy shit.

480
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,631
You're right.

481
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,834
They wanted to forget Freddy so
they wouldn't fear him.

482
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:25,469
What if I screwed up
the town's plan?

483
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:29,543
Fuck! This fucker's gonna spread
like the plague, man!

484
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:32,812
Kids are gonna start
falling asleep, it's gonna--

485
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:34,284
Let's leave, man.
Let's leave right now.

486
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,286
No, I can't leave.

487
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,480
Why not?

488
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,456
I gotta go talk to Lori.
I gotta see if she's OK.

489
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,787
Well, is she worth dying for?

490
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,350
Because if you fall asleep,
you ain't waking up.

491
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,693
If that's the case,
how come you're not dead?

492
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:46,925
Or any of the freaks at Westin?

493
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,196
When's the last time
you even had a nightmare?

494
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:51,725
I don't know.

495
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,704
I can't remember
my dreams anymore.

496
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,266
Look, just give me
one night, OK?

497
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,245
Just let me find Lori,
and then we're out of here.

498
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,739
I swear.

499
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,076
All right.

500
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,916
If your ass isn't back here by
dawn, I'm gone.

501
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,980
We clear on that?

502
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:15,858
This baby's my brother's
pride and joy, so be careful.

503
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,584
Oh, shit.

504
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:50,617
Linderman!

505
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:53,722
Shack, I don't drink.

506
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,578
Hi, Lori. Didn't think
I'd see you here.

507
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:18,317
Can I get you
something to drink?

508
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:21,986
Smooth opening, but, you know,
we're already taken care of.

509
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,359
What happened
to your clothes?

510
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,489
Oh, this.

511
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,623
I was playing
a drinking game...

512
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,999
with some
of the lower primates...

513
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,526
and I guess I'm penalized
for my ability...

514
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,198
to read above
a fourth-grade level.

515
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,968
Linderman, you know,
I always pictured you...

516
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:38,499
as a straight up bedwetter.

517
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,511
You know what, Kia?

518
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,012
I used to think you hated me...

519
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,776
because you thought
I wasn't good enough for Lori...

520
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,077
but that's not it.

521
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:47,347
You tear me down
to make yourself feel better...

522
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:48,785
because you really
hate yourself...

523
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,515
which is kind of pathetic
when you actually...

524
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,715
stop and think about it,
assuming, of course...

525
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,588
you can think
with all that makeup...

526
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:55,650
weighing down your head.

527
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,624
The cops said Blake
committed suicide.

528
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:05,227
Apparently,
it was grief over Trey.

529
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,498
No, man, that's bullshit.

530
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,506
I heard some guy Krueger
killed them both.

531
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,508
Said his name to my parents,
they almost shit themselves.

532
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:11,509
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man,
and I heard...

533
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,010
that Freddy freak,
he used to live here.

534
00:35:13,045 --> 00:35:15,479
Fucking gutted Trey like
a Goddamn turkey, man.

535
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:19,450
Like I heard his intestines and
shit was on the floor--

536
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,647
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

537
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,384
Oh, my God.

538
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:30,020
Look who's here.
Look who's here!

539
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,563
What are you looking at?

540
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,904
Come on, come on, let's dance.

541
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:46,376
Come on, Linderman, let's go.

542
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,402
Where have you been, Will?

543
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,176
Didn't you get my letters?

544
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:51,580
What letters?

545
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,585
They must've never
even mailed them.

546
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,588
Who?

547
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:01,888
The...doctors at Westin Hills.

548
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,358
I've been in
a psychiatric hospital.

549
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:07,865
Mark was with me there.

550
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,663
Some other kids, too.

551
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,693
I don't understand.

552
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,667
Well, I saw on the news
the other night...

553
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,801
I mean, that kid that was
killed at your house.

554
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,608
I mean, I needed to know
that you were safe.

555
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,238
What happened?

556
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,771
I don't know.
I don't know.

557
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,681
Nobody knows.
Nobody saw what happened...

558
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,185
and the police have been
acting really weird...

559
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,653
Iike they know something...

560
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,849
and I heard them
mention some name.

561
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,619
Some...

562
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,058
Freddy. Freddy Krueger.

563
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,959
Where was your dad?

564
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,429
Out of town.

565
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:40,761
Are you sure?

566
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,391
What is going on, Will?

567
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,095
Well, look, four years ago,
I thought l--

568
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:45,296
Enough with
this bullshit talk.

569
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,305
Let's go shake our ass
on the dance floor.

570
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:48,636
Come on!

571
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

572
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,059
I'm dead one day...

573
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,119
and you're already out
getting shit-faced?

574
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:12,289
Same old Gibb!

575
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,960
Trey, l--
I can't believe it.

576
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:18,731
Come on, let's go.

577
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:24,333
Babe, don't make me
ask you twice, OK?

578
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,841
Now!

579
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,757
Trey?

580
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

581
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No!
Open the door!
Please, the door--

582
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,281
No! No!

583
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,043
You're the one
that killed Trey!

584
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:49,747
Oh, don't worry about
my little errand boy.

585
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:54,487
The only to fear
is fear himself!

586
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

587
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,078
No!

588
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,274
She's mine.

589
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,651
Mine! Mine!

590
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:41,190
This everclear
is kicking my ass.

591
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,256
This--

592
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:58,239
Check out this fucking guy.

593
00:41:58,283 --> 00:41:59,511
Well, hey, Jethro!

594
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,577
This is a rave,
not a Halloween party.

595
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,522
Why don't you go
find yourself a pig to fuck?

596
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,116
Yeah!

597
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,560
Invite only, cornpoke,
and you weren't invite--

598
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:13,655
Son of a bitch.

599
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:24,900
Yeah!

600
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:27,776
Burn, motherfucker!

601
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:48,659
No!

602
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:17,850
Run, man, run!

603
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:32,434
Freak!
You killed my brother!

604
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,289
Gibb! Oh, my God!

605
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:50,191
Oh, Gibb! No!

606
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:51,695
Let's go!
Let's go, come on!

607
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:00,463
Was that him?

608
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:02,735
The guy you were talking about--
Freddy Krueger.

609
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:04,503
No, that wasn't
the guy in my dream.

610
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:05,566
That was somebody else!

611
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:08,511
Who cares about some
fucking dream guy, OK?

612
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:10,411
That psycho
in the hockey mask was real.

613
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:12,746
Dude, that goalie was
pissed about something.

614
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:13,944
We need to find the police.

615
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,283
No, no! Fuck the police!

616
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,845
Just take me home, Will.

617
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,090
Gibb, l--

618
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,601
I can't believe she...

619
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:32,796
I know.

620
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,368
Look, call me later, OK?
Please.

621
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,935
Just to check in.

622
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:49,753
Bye, Will.

623
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,221
Be careful.

624
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:12,576
Will, I'm gonna go inside now.

625
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,545
I think that's the last thing
you should do right now.

626
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,343
Oh, Will, please.

627
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:18,474
After everything
that's happened...

628
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:19,483
I just want to go to--

629
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:22,247
There's more
to it than that.

630
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:25,814
Look, I tried to tell
you this earlier.

631
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,449
The reason
I was sent to Westin...

632
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:31,929
is because I saw
your dad kill your mom.

633
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,622
Will, my mom died
in a car accident.

634
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:38,067
No, that's what he
wanted you to believe...

635
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,296
but I was there, Lori.

636
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:42,602
I was sneaking up to your room,
like I used to do.

637
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Only you weren't there.
I saw him kill her.

638
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:52,283
Dad!

639
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:53,750
Get out of the van.

640
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:55,412
Get out of the van!
Where were you?

641
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:56,420
What are you doing?

642
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:57,853
I've been looking
all over for you!

643
00:45:57,889 --> 00:45:59,049
Get away from her!

644
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,421
You're in a helluva
lot of trouble, you know that?

645
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,016
Like I give
a shit anymore.

646
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,254
Get in the house!

647
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:04,556
You! I'm taking you
back to Westin.

648
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,586
No! No way!
You can't trust him, Lori.

649
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,428
Whatever you do,
don't go home with him!

650
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,093
No, listen to me!

651
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,068
He was the one
who had me committed!

652
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,627
You didn't understand.

653
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:15,161
You still don't.
You were confused!

654
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:16,173
Stop it!

655
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:17,799
Both of you, stop it!

656
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:19,434
Damn it, Will!
I am not gonna let you...

657
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,342
endanger my daughter again!

658
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:23,609
Not after everything
that's happened!

659
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:25,946
Stop it! Stop it! Fuck!

660
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:28,384
Lori!

661
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:36,653
I--l--

662
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:38,628
Did Mom die
in a car accident?

663
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:40,824
Yes. Of course she did.

664
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:42,332
Prove it.

665
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:43,994
Show me a death certificate.

666
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:46,367
Show me an autopsy report.

667
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,998
Lori, I don't think now
is the right time--

668
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,007
Really, Dad?

669
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,804
Because I think
it's a perfect time!

670
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:53,504
Why didn't you tell me
about Westin Hills?

671
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,011
Do you work there?

672
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:57,207
Because I thought you were
a fucking general practitioner!

673
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:59,216
Yes, l...

674
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,741
I do some consulting
there now, but...

675
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:03,515
it's--it isn't
what you think.

676
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:07,115
Oh, my God.

677
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:10,059
So you knew about Will
this whole time.

678
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:13,655
Lori, listen to me.

679
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:17,896
You're upset.
We both are.

680
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,903
Now I think what you need now...

681
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:23,202
more than anything
is to get some rest.

682
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:24,902
Why don't I give you
some pills...

683
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,603
and that'll help you sleep...

684
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:29,135
and then we talk
about it in the morning?

685
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,011
I don't want
to sleep, Dad!

686
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:33,142
I want to know why
you've been lying to me!

687
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,242
We'll talk about it
in the morning!

688
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:36,014
Now do what I say!

689
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:37,487
Lori! Lori!

690
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,290
Open this door.
Open this door!

691
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,727
Go away!

692
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:46,730
Damn it, Lori!

693
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:48,391
Let me in!

694
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:55,565
Goddamn it!

695
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

696
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:20,454
It's OK, it's me.
It's me, shh! Shh!

697
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:22,625
You OK? Are you OK?

698
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,794
It's me, all right?

699
00:48:24,836 --> 00:48:29,671
I don't know how your father's
connected to all this...

700
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:30,969
but I think
Mark was right.

701
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,841
There's some kind of cover-up
going on here with Krueger.

702
00:48:35,847 --> 00:48:38,145
We can't trust the police.

703
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:41,512
We can't trust
any of the adults.

704
00:48:43,888 --> 00:48:45,321
So what do we do?

705
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:47,119
We gotta get to Mark.

706
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,052
He's the expert in all of this.

707
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,082
He'll know what's going on.

708
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:05,270
You always looked out
for me, bro.

709
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,708
Hey, Mark.

710
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,513
I gotta stay awake.

711
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

712
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:04,262
Shit!

713
00:50:16,185 --> 00:50:18,210
Hey, Mark.

714
00:50:18,254 --> 00:50:19,812
You didn't forget
about me, did you?

715
00:50:19,855 --> 00:50:21,220
Oh, God.

716
00:50:21,257 --> 00:50:23,282
Oh, that's right!

717
00:50:23,326 --> 00:50:24,657
Everyone forgot!

718
00:50:24,694 --> 00:50:27,128
That's why they weren't
afraid anymore!

719
00:50:27,163 --> 00:50:28,653
That's why I needed Jason
to kill for me...

720
00:50:28,698 --> 00:50:30,791
to get them to remember.

721
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:36,100
But now he just won't stop,
that hockey puck!

722
00:50:43,779 --> 00:50:47,271
This isn't...real.

723
00:50:49,652 --> 00:50:53,281
Somebody, please, wake me up!

724
00:50:53,322 --> 00:50:54,619
Please!

725
00:51:05,468 --> 00:51:08,266
Mark! Mark, wake up!

726
00:51:08,304 --> 00:51:11,137
I need you to send
a little message for me.

727
00:51:11,173 --> 00:51:14,506
That's all,
just a little message.

728
00:51:14,543 --> 00:51:16,443
I'm not gonna do it.

729
00:51:16,479 --> 00:51:18,106
I won't do it!

730
00:51:18,147 --> 00:51:20,672
No?!

731
00:51:20,716 --> 00:51:23,617
I won't do it.

732
00:51:32,028 --> 00:51:37,864
I'll have to pass that message
myself, won't l?

733
00:51:43,072 --> 00:51:44,835
Oh, my God!

734
00:51:48,377 --> 00:51:52,313
Let go of me!

735
00:51:52,348 --> 00:51:53,906
Help...me.

736
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:55,576
Mark!

737
00:52:06,095 --> 00:52:10,361
Pass on a little
message for me, will ya?

738
00:52:21,844 --> 00:52:24,813
Sheriff,
I've been compiling info...

739
00:52:24,847 --> 00:52:26,781
based on eyewitness reports
of the hockey mask killer.

740
00:52:26,816 --> 00:52:28,545
We already know who did this.

741
00:52:28,584 --> 00:52:30,575
Sheriff, we closed
down the school...

742
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:32,382
and set up a curfew
for anyone under eighteen.

743
00:52:32,421 --> 00:52:33,513
Good.

744
00:52:33,556 --> 00:52:35,319
Now I want twenty-four-hour
roadblocks set up.

745
00:52:35,357 --> 00:52:36,949
Nobody leaves town,
nobody gets in.

746
00:52:36,992 --> 00:52:38,516
We're gonna contain
this son of a bitch...

747
00:52:38,561 --> 00:52:39,755
before he spreads any further.

748
00:52:39,795 --> 00:52:41,990
Yes, sir.

749
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:43,931
Sir, shouldn't we have
the F.B.I. come in and--

750
00:52:43,966 --> 00:52:46,127
No outsiders, Stubbs.

751
00:52:46,168 --> 00:52:48,636
We can handle this.
We've stopped him before.

752
00:52:48,671 --> 00:52:50,901
OK, I'm a little lost here.

753
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,339
Stopped who before?

754
00:52:52,374 --> 00:52:55,571
We don't say his name out loud.

755
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:57,545
You're not from around here.

756
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,547
I don't expect you
to understand.

757
00:52:58,581 --> 00:53:00,640
With all due resect, Sheriff...

758
00:53:00,683 --> 00:53:03,277
I think we have a copycat
of the old Jason Voorhees...

759
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:04,684
Crystal Lake killer
on our hands--

760
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,017
You listen to me.

761
00:53:06,055 --> 00:53:08,489
We do things around here
a certain way for a reason...

762
00:53:08,524 --> 00:53:10,890
and that's given us
four years of peace.

763
00:53:10,926 --> 00:53:12,985
So you either do your job
and keep your mouth shut...

764
00:53:13,028 --> 00:53:15,223
or, so help me God,
I will lock you up!

765
00:53:15,264 --> 00:53:17,596
Do you understand me?!

766
00:53:20,636 --> 00:53:21,796
Yes, sir.

767
00:53:32,515 --> 00:53:34,380
Why don't we all just leave?

768
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:39,149
No, even if we leave,
Freddy can still get us.

769
00:53:39,188 --> 00:53:42,624
We all know about him.
We're all afraid of him.

770
00:53:44,393 --> 00:53:49,092
It was our fear that
gave him his power.

771
00:53:49,131 --> 00:53:51,725
We're marked now.

772
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:53,564
Man, screw that clown.

773
00:53:53,602 --> 00:53:55,069
I mean, what kind
of a pussy...

774
00:53:55,104 --> 00:53:56,765
comes after you
in your dreams anyway?

775
00:53:56,806 --> 00:53:59,832
Now, that big-ass mother fucker
back at the cornfield...

776
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:02,036
all right, that's who
we should be afraid of.

777
00:54:02,077 --> 00:54:04,272
Tell me who
the fuck that was.

778
00:54:04,313 --> 00:54:06,713
His name was Jason Voorhees.

779
00:54:06,749 --> 00:54:09,980
Shit, man...um...

780
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:12,954
How'd you know
we were here?

781
00:54:12,988 --> 00:54:15,218
Nothing personal,
but the Scooby van out back...

782
00:54:15,257 --> 00:54:17,054
wasn't exactly subtle.

783
00:54:17,092 --> 00:54:19,424
And never keep
your keys in the door.

784
00:54:19,461 --> 00:54:21,725
Great, so now we're
completely fucked.

785
00:54:21,764 --> 00:54:23,629
No, you're not.

786
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:26,191
I'm here to help you.

787
00:54:26,235 --> 00:54:29,033
Now, this Jason Voorhees
supposedly drowned...

788
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:31,562
at Camp Crystal Lake
back in 1957...

789
00:54:31,607 --> 00:54:33,336
when he was
eleven years old.

790
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:36,173
The counselors weren't
watching him...

791
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:39,010
then they made the mistake
of killing his mother.

792
00:54:39,048 --> 00:54:41,175
The legend has it...

793
00:54:41,217 --> 00:54:43,708
that Jason kept returning
from his grave...

794
00:54:43,752 --> 00:54:45,583
to punish whoever
returned to the camp.

795
00:54:45,621 --> 00:54:48,522
I think we're dealing
with a copycat here.

796
00:54:48,557 --> 00:54:50,149
No. No. No, no, no.

797
00:54:50,192 --> 00:54:51,682
He's not a copycat.

798
00:54:51,727 --> 00:54:53,354
I've seen what he can do.
He's the real Jason.

799
00:54:53,395 --> 00:54:55,693
That's impossible, Linderman.
Jason is dead.

800
00:54:55,731 --> 00:54:58,859
You'd better start thinking
outside your little box, dude...

801
00:54:58,901 --> 00:55:00,562
'cause somebody's
definitely breaking...

802
00:55:00,603 --> 00:55:02,628
the fucking reality rules, OK?

803
00:55:02,671 --> 00:55:04,036
It makes sense in a way.

804
00:55:04,073 --> 00:55:07,600
I mean, what if Freddy
brought Jason back...

805
00:55:07,643 --> 00:55:09,907
because he was too weak
to go after us on his own...

806
00:55:09,945 --> 00:55:12,505
so he used Jason.

807
00:55:12,548 --> 00:55:14,607
I mean, he knew that
we'd think it was him...

808
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,174
that we'd spread
the fear again.

809
00:55:16,218 --> 00:55:17,412
And now that it's working...

810
00:55:17,453 --> 00:55:20,013
it's like he can't
shut Jason back down.

811
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:21,682
Wait a minute.

812
00:55:21,724 --> 00:55:24,750
Freddy died by fire,
Jason by water.

813
00:55:24,793 --> 00:55:26,852
How can we use that?

814
00:55:26,896 --> 00:55:29,694
I think we should
concentrate on Jason first.

815
00:55:29,732 --> 00:55:31,427
But I thought we decided...

816
00:55:31,467 --> 00:55:33,162
that Freddy was the one
pulling the strings.

817
00:55:33,202 --> 00:55:35,636
Shouldn't we go
after him first?

818
00:55:35,671 --> 00:55:38,299
I don't know, maybe
what we need to do is...

819
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,934
to offer Freddy
a sacrifice.

820
00:55:40,976 --> 00:55:42,534
Yeah, yeah, totally.

821
00:55:42,578 --> 00:55:45,809
Like a virgin, right?
Someone pure.

822
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,620
Dude, don't look at me.

823
00:55:53,656 --> 00:55:56,124
Even if you pay for it,
it still counts.

824
00:55:56,158 --> 00:55:58,217
Oh, come on.

825
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,058
Look, we all know who
the real virgin is here.

826
00:56:01,096 --> 00:56:03,758
-Kia!
-Oh, come on, Lori.

827
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:05,596
I know you never
made it with Will.

828
00:56:05,634 --> 00:56:10,435
Why would he want to when
he can fuck somebody like me?

829
00:56:15,878 --> 00:56:17,470
Let's tie the bitch up.

830
00:56:20,449 --> 00:56:22,440
What?

831
00:56:24,887 --> 00:56:27,253
Don't worry, angel.

832
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You've still got me.
Come on, give daddy a kiss.

833
00:56:36,165 --> 00:56:39,828
Your eyes say no-no...

834
00:56:39,868 --> 00:56:44,305
but my mouth says yes-yes.

835
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Lori, are you all right?
You fell asleep.

836
00:56:59,688 --> 00:57:01,781
Oh, shit!

837
00:57:05,627 --> 00:57:07,618
I pulled that out of my dream.

838
00:57:07,663 --> 00:57:09,654
How is that possible?

839
00:57:09,698 --> 00:57:11,723
Anything is possible now!

840
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:13,029
God, you just don't get it!

841
00:57:13,068 --> 00:57:15,195
Oh, God, y'all, two killers?

842
00:57:15,237 --> 00:57:17,137
We're not safe awake or asleep.

843
00:57:17,172 --> 00:57:19,003
It's not the sleep
that's killing us...

844
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:20,008
it's our dreams.

845
00:57:20,042 --> 00:57:22,704
At Westin, Mark and l
never had dreams.

846
00:57:22,745 --> 00:57:25,475
Were you on any drugs?

847
00:57:25,514 --> 00:57:27,914
Yeah, but there's
something called hypnocil.

848
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:30,009
They never told us
what it was for...

849
00:57:30,052 --> 00:57:32,077
but everyone there
was taking it.

850
00:57:34,189 --> 00:57:36,817
Experimental drug...

851
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:38,417
not even approved yet
by the F.D.A.

852
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,257
Oh, shit.

853
00:57:40,295 --> 00:57:44,197
Used for...
suppression of dreams.

854
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:47,725
We need those pills,
enough for all of us.

855
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,897
Can you get us
back to Westin Hills?

856
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:11,817
All right,
this isn't it, guys.

857
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,691
Come on, let's go.

858
00:58:13,729 --> 00:58:14,696
Hey, dude.

859
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,061
Let's take a little
J-break, huh?

860
00:58:16,098 --> 00:58:18,760
No, man. He's a cop.

861
00:58:18,801 --> 00:58:21,292
Come on. What's he
gonna do, arrest me?

862
00:58:21,336 --> 00:58:23,668
Hold up.
Hang on a second.

863
00:58:23,705 --> 00:58:25,070
Fuck.

864
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:35,880
That's better.

865
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:53,294
Where's Freeburg?

866
00:58:53,335 --> 00:58:54,324
Come on. Come on!

867
00:59:12,121 --> 00:59:13,281
This is "D" wing.

868
00:59:13,322 --> 00:59:16,018
These are the ones
who wouldn't stop dreaming.

869
00:59:24,066 --> 00:59:25,294
Are they dead?

870
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,639
They're in a coma.

871
00:59:31,673 --> 00:59:34,471
It says they were given
too much hypnocil.

872
00:59:35,844 --> 00:59:37,709
Who would do this to people?

873
00:59:37,746 --> 00:59:40,374
Your dad's name
is at the bottom...

874
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,973
of both of these charts.

875
00:59:50,092 --> 00:59:52,458
Cool...yeah.

876
01:00:02,437 --> 01:00:05,065
What the fuck?

877
01:00:18,854 --> 01:00:20,253
Nice.

878
01:00:27,963 --> 01:00:29,760
Oh, yeah.

879
01:00:34,203 --> 01:00:35,898
Hold up, man.

880
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:48,940
What?

881
01:00:54,923 --> 01:00:56,117
What do you want?

882
01:00:59,294 --> 01:01:02,923
No, I don't know where
the hypnocil is, OK?

883
01:01:13,976 --> 01:01:15,341
I can't pour these
down the drain.

884
01:01:15,377 --> 01:01:16,810
We need this stuff.

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

886
01:01:33,629 --> 01:01:34,994
Freeburg!

887
01:01:36,999 --> 01:01:37,966
Freeburg!

888
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,262
What are you doing?

889
01:01:39,301 --> 01:01:40,427
We need those drugs!

890
01:01:41,436 --> 01:01:42,698
Dude, no! Dude--

891
01:01:49,678 --> 01:01:51,305
Go on! Get out of here!

892
01:01:51,346 --> 01:01:53,007
Go!

893
01:02:08,697 --> 01:02:10,130
What was that?

894
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:14,959
Let's go check it out.
Let's go.

895
01:02:16,238 --> 01:02:20,436
Get back! Shit! Hell!

896
01:02:20,475 --> 01:02:21,999
Fucker!

897
01:02:22,044 --> 01:02:23,443
Help me!

898
01:02:40,529 --> 01:02:41,826
Shit! They're all empty!

899
01:02:41,863 --> 01:02:42,830
We gotta keep looking.

900
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Maybe there's some down here.
Damn, it's gotta
be here somewhere.

901
01:02:56,878 --> 01:02:57,970
Freeburg, come on!

902
01:02:58,013 --> 01:02:59,913
Come on! Come on!

903
01:02:59,948 --> 01:03:02,178
What are you waiting for?
Come on!

904
01:03:02,217 --> 01:03:04,344
Freeburg, time to go.

905
01:03:04,386 --> 01:03:06,684
We gotta go!
Now! come on!

906
01:03:06,722 --> 01:03:09,384
Let me handle this, bitch.

907
01:03:09,424 --> 01:03:11,085
What?

908
01:03:12,627 --> 01:03:14,424
Come on, come on!
OK, let's go!

909
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:17,162
Let's go.

910
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:18,291
No, wait, wait!

911
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:19,322
Look.

912
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:24,563
Come to Freddy.

913
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:28,574
These are my children, Jason.

914
01:03:28,977 --> 01:03:31,468
Go back where you belong!

915
01:03:42,157 --> 01:03:44,352
Fuck you!

916
01:03:46,128 --> 01:03:48,062
Linderman...

917
01:03:49,931 --> 01:03:53,298
These are my children, Jason.

918
01:03:53,335 --> 01:03:55,803
Go back where you belong.

919
01:04:08,116 --> 01:04:11,950
Jason...Jason.

920
01:04:11,987 --> 01:04:15,320
My special, special boy.

921
01:04:19,694 --> 01:04:22,060
I'm disappointed
in you, Jason.

922
01:04:22,097 --> 01:04:23,997
You disobeyed me.

923
01:04:24,032 --> 01:04:25,727
You were supposed
to come back home...

924
01:04:25,767 --> 01:04:27,530
just kill a few of them!

925
01:04:27,569 --> 01:04:29,764
But I blame myself.
I should've known...

926
01:04:29,805 --> 01:04:31,932
you wouldn't be able
to stop killing!

927
01:04:31,973 --> 01:04:37,138
You are like a big, stupid dog
who can't stop eating...

928
01:04:37,179 --> 01:04:41,616
even though your master
said you've had enough!

929
01:04:47,722 --> 01:04:52,159
Now it's time to put
this bad dog to sleep...

930
01:04:54,563 --> 01:04:55,689
for good!

931
01:05:02,871 --> 01:05:04,463
Not my arm!

932
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:33,067
Welcome to my nightmare.

933
01:05:53,154 --> 01:05:55,384
Penny for your thoughts, chief!

934
01:05:57,225 --> 01:05:59,386
Oh, scary.

935
01:06:19,247 --> 01:06:20,509
Tilt.

936
01:06:44,205 --> 01:06:46,400
Why won't you die?

937
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,159
Come on. Come on!

938
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,749
So you are afraid of something
after all, huh?

939
01:07:46,034 --> 01:07:48,662
How in the fuck did I let y'all
talk me into this?

940
01:07:48,703 --> 01:07:50,796
Why don't we just
try and do it here?

941
01:07:50,839 --> 01:07:52,830
Why go all the way
to Crystal Lake?

942
01:07:52,874 --> 01:07:54,933
Best-case scenario: Jason wins.

943
01:07:54,976 --> 01:07:57,740
He'll already be home,
back where he belongs.

944
01:07:57,779 --> 01:07:58,973
I mean, why follow us anymore?

945
01:07:59,014 --> 01:08:00,675
And if Freddy wins?

946
01:08:00,715 --> 01:08:03,707
At least Jason
has home-field advantage.

947
01:08:28,843 --> 01:08:32,210
Aww...how sweet.

948
01:08:33,348 --> 01:08:35,509
You ugly little shit.

949
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:40,385
Now there's a face...
only a mother could love!

950
01:08:42,724 --> 01:08:43,918
Yeah!

951
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:45,858
Now we're getting somewhere.

952
01:08:45,894 --> 01:08:48,522
Let's see
what really scares you.

953
01:08:55,603 --> 01:08:58,436
And dig a little deeper.

954
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm dying to see what skeletons
are hidden in your closet.

955
01:09:49,424 --> 01:09:51,722
We're seriously running
out of tranq here, guys.

956
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,991
I got maybe one dose,
plus enough for Lori.

957
01:09:55,029 --> 01:09:56,257
Well, we're almost there.

958
01:09:56,297 --> 01:09:57,696
Then I better get going.

959
01:09:57,732 --> 01:09:58,960
No, no, just...

960
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:05,336
I don't want you to go.

961
01:10:05,373 --> 01:10:06,897
I'm coming back.

962
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:09,603
Just give me fifteen minutes,
then wake me up.

963
01:10:09,644 --> 01:10:11,874
I'll bring that bastard
Freddy back through.

964
01:10:11,913 --> 01:10:14,643
Just make sure
Jason's waiting for him.

965
01:10:19,287 --> 01:10:22,415
Now I lay me down to sleep.

966
01:10:43,978 --> 01:10:48,278
Freak show! Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

967
01:10:48,316 --> 01:10:49,806
Bull's-eye!

968
01:10:53,922 --> 01:10:55,947
Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

969
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:57,389
Try this on!

970
01:10:58,593 --> 01:11:01,687
Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

971
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,033
Stupid!

972
01:11:10,338 --> 01:11:12,306
Aren't you gonna help the kid?!

973
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,865
Can't you see I'm busy here?

974
01:11:14,909 --> 01:11:16,342
You mean you're not coming?

975
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,545
It's not my fault this bitch
is dead on her feet.

976
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:32,951
It's been five minutes.

977
01:11:32,994 --> 01:11:35,189
Well, that was the last
of the tranq, OK? We're out.

978
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:37,164
Calm down, OK?
Just relax!

979
01:11:50,945 --> 01:11:52,879
Heeeeelp!

980
01:11:52,914 --> 01:11:56,543
Wait! Give me your hand!

981
01:11:56,584 --> 01:11:59,348
Give me your hand!

982
01:12:00,855 --> 01:12:01,947
Help!

983
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:04,254
Jason?

984
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:06,055
Jason Vorhees?

985
01:12:16,738 --> 01:12:18,706
Y'all...y'all...

986
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:19,764
Y'all, something's wrong.

987
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:21,001
It's like he's drowning
or something.

988
01:12:21,042 --> 01:12:22,407
Freddy must be killing him.

989
01:12:22,443 --> 01:12:23,410
We need him alive!

990
01:12:23,444 --> 01:12:24,536
Dude, what do you
want me to do...

991
01:12:24,579 --> 01:12:27,047
Iike, give him
mouth-to-mouth or something?

992
01:12:34,789 --> 01:12:36,620
Hell no.
Why are you--

993
01:12:36,658 --> 01:12:39,126
No! No, I'm not
gonna do that. No!

994
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,422
Kia, look, I would
do it myself...

995
01:12:40,461 --> 01:12:42,156
but I've had asthma
since I was six, OK?

996
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:43,663
I don't have the lung power.

997
01:12:43,698 --> 01:12:45,131
No.

998
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:47,498
Kia, he has asthma!

999
01:12:47,535 --> 01:12:50,060
Ooh! Ooh...

1000
01:12:51,306 --> 01:12:53,001
Look, you can do this, OK?

1001
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:54,167
You can do this.
You just--

1002
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:57,939
Shut up! You're not the one
that has to do this.

1003
01:12:57,979 --> 01:12:58,968
I know, but l--

1004
01:12:59,013 --> 01:13:00,378
Shut up!

1005
01:13:03,451 --> 01:13:05,510
Oh, my God.

1006
01:13:07,455 --> 01:13:09,923
Ohh, God!

1007
01:13:15,163 --> 01:13:16,824
Oh, man.

1008
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1009
01:13:43,524 --> 01:13:45,651
You!

1010
01:13:59,841 --> 01:14:01,570
What's wrong, Lori?

1011
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:03,509
Miss your wake-up call?

1012
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,241
Wake me up!
I got him! I got him!

1013
01:14:13,354 --> 01:14:15,481
No!

1014
01:14:15,523 --> 01:14:16,547
Lori, come on! Wake up!

1015
01:14:16,591 --> 01:14:18,252
Lori, wake up, please!

1016
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:19,691
Look!

1017
01:14:19,727 --> 01:14:21,217
Guys, look.

1018
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:24,022
We're almost there.

1019
01:14:24,065 --> 01:14:26,863
Help me. Come on.
We gotta get her up.

1020
01:14:28,136 --> 01:14:30,195
Come on. Start running.
Start running.

1021
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:32,138
Wake me up!

1022
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:35,536
Daddy, don't!

1023
01:15:01,903 --> 01:15:04,428
Daddy!
No, daddy, don't!

1024
01:15:04,472 --> 01:15:06,303
Freddy!
It was you!

1025
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:08,433
I've always had a thing...

1026
01:15:08,476 --> 01:15:11,274
for the whores
that live in this house.

1027
01:15:21,456 --> 01:15:22,480
Lori, wake up!

1028
01:15:25,426 --> 01:15:26,757
Oh, shit.

1029
01:15:31,699 --> 01:15:33,132
It's him. He's here.

1030
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:34,759
Lori, come on!
You gotta wake up!

1031
01:15:39,507 --> 01:15:41,134
Oh, yes.

1032
01:15:46,214 --> 01:15:48,182
My God!

1033
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on, Lori, wake up!
Lori, please. Wake up!
Lori, please.
Lori, please.

1034
01:16:01,696 --> 01:16:02,720
Go! Go, go, go!

1035
01:16:05,766 --> 01:16:07,063
Lori!

1036
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:14,331
Oh, you fuckin' asshole!

1037
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:15,501
Goddamn it!

1038
01:16:19,547 --> 01:16:22,573
Welcome to my world, bitch.

1039
01:16:24,819 --> 01:16:27,549
I should warn you, princess...

1040
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:30,182
the first time tends
to get a little...

1041
01:16:31,425 --> 01:16:33,552
messy.

1042
01:16:50,578 --> 01:16:51,567
Get away from her!

1043
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,052
Linderman.

1044
01:17:07,161 --> 01:17:08,423
Oh! Oh, no!

1045
01:17:16,137 --> 01:17:18,799
Die, you little bitch.

1046
01:18:13,194 --> 01:18:15,594
Jesus, Linderman.
You--you're really hurt.

1047
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:17,461
No. No, no, no.
Don't worry about me.

1048
01:18:17,498 --> 01:18:18,624
Just a scratch.

1049
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:19,792
Just go get help, OK?

1050
01:18:19,834 --> 01:18:21,859
What? You don't think--

1051
01:18:21,902 --> 01:18:23,699
Look, I'm just gonna
rest here a minute.

1052
01:18:23,738 --> 01:18:26,036
-Linderman--
-I'm fine, Kia.

1053
01:18:26,073 --> 01:18:27,335
Really.
Now get out of here.

1054
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:28,899
-Go get help.
-But you--

1055
01:18:28,943 --> 01:18:30,467
Just go.

1056
01:18:31,545 --> 01:18:35,037
OK, but I'm gonna be back
as soon as I can.

1057
01:19:15,022 --> 01:19:16,284
Lori!

1058
01:19:16,324 --> 01:19:18,656
Think you're so smart,
huh, bitch?

1059
01:19:20,127 --> 01:19:21,492
Freddy!

1060
01:19:31,038 --> 01:19:33,131
How sweet...

1061
01:19:33,174 --> 01:19:35,074
dark meat.

1062
01:19:35,109 --> 01:19:37,976
-No! Kia!
-Let's go!

1063
01:19:38,012 --> 01:19:39,479
Nooo!

1064
01:19:39,513 --> 01:19:41,845
So you're the one
everyone's afraid of?

1065
01:19:44,118 --> 01:19:46,143
Tell me something.

1066
01:19:46,187 --> 01:19:47,882
What kind of faggot...

1067
01:19:47,922 --> 01:19:50,550
runs around
in a Christmas sweater?

1068
01:19:51,926 --> 01:19:54,258
I mean, come on. Get real.

1069
01:19:54,295 --> 01:19:55,956
You're not even scary.

1070
01:19:55,996 --> 01:19:57,759
You're not even scary.

1071
01:19:57,798 --> 01:20:01,632
And let's talk about
the butter knives.

1072
01:20:01,669 --> 01:20:03,466
What is with the butter knives?

1073
01:20:03,504 --> 01:20:06,598
You trying to compensate
for something?

1074
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,107
Maybe coming up
a little short there...

1075
01:20:08,142 --> 01:20:11,202
between the legs,
Mr. Krueger?

1076
01:20:11,245 --> 01:20:12,405
Hmm.

1077
01:20:12,446 --> 01:20:15,973
I mean, you got these
teensy-weensy little things...

1078
01:20:16,016 --> 01:20:21,454
and Jason has got this
big ol' thing that's like...

1079
01:20:30,498 --> 01:20:31,487
Kia!

1080
01:20:31,532 --> 01:20:33,432
-No! No!
-Come on!

1081
01:20:38,806 --> 01:20:39,795
Come on, Lori.
Let's go.

1082
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,864
We can't help her anymore.

1083
01:20:40,908 --> 01:20:42,535
No! I'm staying!

1084
01:20:42,576 --> 01:20:45,136
Are you crazy?
You got what you wanted.

1085
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:47,010
You pulled Freddy out,
and now he's fighting Jason.

1086
01:20:47,047 --> 01:20:48,241
Come on!
What more do you want?

1087
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
He killed my mother, Will!
It was Freddy.
My dad covered it up
to protect me.
He didn't do it.
Look, he has taken
everything from us!

1088
01:20:56,524 --> 01:20:58,856
He has ruined
both of our pasts...

1089
01:20:58,893 --> 01:21:02,260
and I am not leaving
until I see him die!

1090
01:21:30,991 --> 01:21:32,822
Man the torpedoes.

1091
01:21:56,951 --> 01:21:58,578
Hey, asshole!

1092
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,747
Up here!

1093
01:22:08,362 --> 01:22:10,159
Aha!

1094
01:22:27,248 --> 01:22:28,613
Yeah.

1095
01:22:39,293 --> 01:22:41,124
Ah, give me a break.

1096
01:23:06,854 --> 01:23:08,287
Oh, no.

1097
01:23:08,322 --> 01:23:12,281
Ohh, noooo!

1098
01:24:36,377 --> 01:24:38,311
Lori, get the tanks!

1099
01:24:42,049 --> 01:24:43,311
Give it up!

1100
01:25:10,611 --> 01:25:12,169
Freddy!

1101
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:15,112
Go to hell!

1102
01:27:04,224 --> 01:27:06,158
It's OK. It's OK.

1103
01:27:37,558 --> 01:27:39,185
You...

1104
01:28:11,024 --> 01:28:13,925
Welcome to my world, bitch!
