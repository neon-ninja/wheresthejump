7
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:55,478
I don't understand

8
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:56,981
what you're talking about.
What is this break?

9
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:59,816
Like, I-I... I'm here
as often as I can be.

10
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,384
I'm working two jobs.

11
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:02,952
I don't know what else
you want me to do.

12
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:04,789
Ah, what a wonderful day.

13
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,727
The sun is out.
The water is shimmering.

14
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,795
Scallops are chirping.

15
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:15,032
So peaceful.

16
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:16,600
Good morning to you, sir.

17
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:18,902
Would you care to blow a bubble?

18
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

19
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

20
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:23,734
Oliver.

21
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:25,735
We're okay. We're okay.

22
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:28,037
What happened? Huh?

23
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:30,140
Can you use your words, please?

24
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:33,943
There you go.

25
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:40,984
Something.

26
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:42,919
In.

27
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:44,121
House.

28
00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:46,255
Something in house.

29
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:48,125
That was probably
just a nightmare,

30
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:50,259
'cause there is nobody
in the house

31
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,228
but your mom and your dad.

32
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:53,830
All right, come here.

33
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:55,499
Come here, come here, come here.

34
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:58,435
Can you take some deep breaths
for me, huh?

35
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:02,306
Okay? We're gonna do
some deep breaths.

36
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:04,807
Okay?

37
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:21,291
So, he woke up in the
middle of the night screaming.

38
00:08:21,323 --> 00:08:23,893
I went in there. I was up
for two hours with him.

39
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:25,763
He's a little boy.

40
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,098
- He has nightmares.
- That's easy for you to say.

41
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:30,032
You never go in with him.
It's always me.

42
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,435
I slept through it.

43
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,503
- All right? I'm sorry.
- No, don't do that.

44
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:35,939
Why can't you just admit
that you don't want to help?

45
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:37,975
I help, okay?

46
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:39,877
I always help... when I'm awake.

47
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,044
Hey, buddy.

48
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:44,148
No more nightmares, huh?

49
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:46,550
I heard you had
a bad dream, bud.

50
00:08:46,582 --> 00:08:48,951
Need a hug?

51
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:51,888
I know what the problem is.

52
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:54,859
Too far away.

53
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,527
Yep. Let's see.

54
00:08:57,561 --> 00:09:00,964
Ten feet. Oh, that's definitely
too far for a hug.

55
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:03,066
What do you think five feet is?

56
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:04,501
Yeah, okay.

57
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,102
Little closer.

58
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:08,437
I'm getting the weirdest
reading on this thing.

59
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,806
It just...

60
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,109
Tummy tickles!

61
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:13,343
Ooh!

62
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,012
Your throne, sire.

63
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:22,518
Are you able to make it
to his speech therapy today?

64
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:24,153
Oh, sorry, I can't.

65
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:26,989
Uh, I picked up a shift
at the parking lot.

66
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:29,192
Oh, well, hopefully,
you can make one soon, right?

67
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:30,527
Yeah, for sure.

68
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,029
Are.

69
00:09:33,562 --> 00:09:35,965
We.

70
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,334
Moving.

71
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,304
Are we moving?

72
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:48,412
You are not moving anywhere,
okay?

73
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:50,281
So don't worry.

74
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:53,950
Today, we're gonna start in

75
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:55,619
with multiplying
more than two numbers.

76
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:57,554
Not cool, man.

77
00:09:57,586 --> 00:10:00,157
You don't even know
what you're groaning about.

78
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,992
It's not so hard.
If you can multiply

79
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:04,126
two numbers, you can multiply
three. You just take it...

80
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,495
Make sure you pay attention
to the lesson, okay?

81
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:08,231
Anybody want to take this?

82
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:10,399
Come on, you learn by trying.

83
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:12,468
Nobody?

84
00:10:12,502 --> 00:10:14,171
Oliver.

85
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:19,409
What do you make
of these three numbers?

86
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,450
The.

87
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:27,584
Answer.

88
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,286
Is.

89
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:31,054
Eight.

90
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:33,289
The answer is eight.

91
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:35,524
Not quite. I see
what you did there, though.

92
00:10:35,557 --> 00:10:36,926
You were adding
instead of multiplying.

93
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,262
Very good try, Oliver.

94
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:40,163
Anyone else
want to give it a go?

95
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:41,931
Go ahead, Byron.

96
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:44,468
How come Oliver still gets
to use his phone in class

97
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,335
but you took mine away?

98
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:48,238
He's autistic, dude.

99
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:50,107
So he gets special treatment?

100
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:52,074
Oliver gets to use his phone

101
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:53,210
because he wasn't playing
<i>Fortnite</i>

102
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:54,378
during the Pledge of Allegiance.

103
00:10:54,411 --> 00:10:56,046
Ooh.

104
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,614
Let's get back
to our first pair.

105
00:10:58,648 --> 00:11:02,252
The product of two and four...
why don't we start there?

106
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:03,986
Try one of those

107
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,055
radioactive sludge balls
you call food?

108
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:07,324
Next, I suppose you'll want me

109
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:08,624
to go square-dancing
with Patrick.

110
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:10,159
Hey. What's up?

111
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:12,028
Sorry, Patrick.

112
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:14,632
Do you want to come
hang out with us?

113
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:18,502
Where?

114
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:20,670
Oh, uh, it's just...

115
00:11:20,704 --> 00:11:22,973
I saw something cool over there.

116
00:11:28,277 --> 00:11:30,113
That way.

117
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:32,216
I'll catch up in a sec.

118
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:08,151
Friends.

119
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,560
Hello?

120
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,370
Hey.

121
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:29,038
I can't believe
he actually fell for it.

122
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:31,207
Of course he did.

123
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,508
- He's such a loser.
- Is he having

124
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:34,076
- a heart attack?
- He totally is.

125
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:35,211
We're supposed to call 911.

126
00:12:35,244 --> 00:12:36,312
Dude, dude, listen.

127
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:38,347
That's just how he talks.

128
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,082
Moaner Boner.

129
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:42,686
It's like, he can't even talk.

130
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:51,427
Exactly. Hey, maybe
he's a robot under his skin.

131
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,196
Moaner Boner thinks he's special.

132
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:58,167
Oh, did you want
to say something?

133
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,469
I can't believe you used to be

134
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:00,737
friends with
Moaner Boner over here.

135
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:02,371
- My mom made me.
- You.

136
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:03,739
I didn't want to.

137
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:06,609
Are.

138
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:08,077
Very.

139
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:12,548
You are very ugly.

140
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:18,721
Who's ugly now?

141
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,258
Come on.

142
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:45,148
<i>I didn't know
what to think when I pulled up</i>

143
00:13:45,181 --> 00:13:47,551
and he wasn't there
waiting for me.

144
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:50,387
I went right into
the worst-case scenarios.

145
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,322
Uh, did he get in trouble?

146
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:54,324
Did someone take him?

147
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:59,796
And then I found him
just screaming in the field.

148
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:02,599
That sounds very scary
for both of you.

149
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:05,268
And he lost his phone somehow.

150
00:14:06,536 --> 00:14:08,405
I wish he could explain
what happened.

151
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:10,506
Good.

152
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,243
Now we're gonna try
using our words.

153
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:14,678
"Lost...

154
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,580
in field."

155
00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:19,749
We're gonna work
on your F's, okay?

156
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:21,484
F's can be tricky.

157
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:23,353
"Field."

158
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:26,422
"Field." Can you try that?

159
00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:28,558
F...

160
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,595
F...

161
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:35,131
F...

162
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,700
Oliver, you can do it.

163
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:39,536
F...

164
00:14:42,504 --> 00:14:43,672
Okay.

165
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:46,276
Good practicing.

166
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:48,344
<i>Have you been
trying to provide him</i>

167
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:49,912
<i>with social experiences,</i>

168
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:51,480
like we discussed?

169
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:53,282
Poor guy still doesn't have
any friends.

170
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:58,254
You said he was hanging out
with your friend's son?

171
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:00,257
- Jennifer's son, Byron.
- Yeah.

172
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,226
- Yeah, w-we're not close anymore.
- Okay.

173
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:06,662
<i>So, if you can make any effort
to help him find friends...</i>

174
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:09,331
<i>take him to birthday parties,
anything...</i>

175
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:11,935
<i>it can be a good way
to get him to open up.</i>

176
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:14,437
<i>And just like he's trying
to get better at talking,</i>

177
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,439
<i>we have to make sure
we're listening.</i>

178
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:23,380
Okay, Patrick,
it's all in the technique.

179
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:25,315
First, go like this.

180
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:26,850
Spin around. Stop.

181
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:28,718
Double-take three times.

182
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,553
- One, two, three.
- Come on.

183
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:32,622
Oliver, you got to stay
with me, okay?

184
00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:51,207
Five bucks, please.

185
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,942
Thanks a lot.

186
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:12,762
Come on.

187
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

188
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

189
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,479
Oliver, take that box off.

190
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:10,813
Whoa, buddy.

191
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:12,982
It's time to brush your teeth.

192
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,019
He's full of energy tonight.

193
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,521
Yeah, he is.

194
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:20,590
Where'd you get that?

195
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:22,926
It was at
the lost and found at work.

196
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,994
I think it just
needs to be charged.

197
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:27,563
I guess you like it, huh?

198
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:29,632
Hey, be careful with the screen.

199
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:31,701
It's a little cracked.

200
00:18:31,734 --> 00:18:32,968
- What?
- You know what.

201
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:34,738
I run around
with our son all day,

202
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:37,407
and you get to swoop in
and be the hero once again?

203
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,674
The hero?

204
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:02,432
It's not all presents
and tummy tickles with me

205
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:04,167
like it is with you.

206
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:06,535
I just wish I could take
that part of him

207
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:08,638
and put it in a box
and tape it up

208
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,905
and hide it somewhere

209
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:12,574
so he didn't have to deal
with it.

210
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:14,845
Then he wouldn't be our Oliver.

211
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,483
I should've...

212
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:23,720
I should've taken him sooner.

213
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:27,924
What if he never learns to talk
because I didn't

214
00:19:27,956 --> 00:19:29,825
- do anything for so long?
- No.

215
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:31,595
We didn't do anything.

216
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:36,999
He's never looked me
in the eyes.

217
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:39,135
Do you know what it's like
for your own child

218
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,537
to never look you in the eyes?

219
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:46,074
Well...

220
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:48,878
he's got nice eyes,
if that helps.

221
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:54,884
No, Marty, it doesn't help,
because he... he loves you

222
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,119
and he hates me.

223
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

224
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,067
Okay, now, how many of you

225
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,202
have played
musical instruments before?

226
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:35,237
Do instruments of torture count?

227
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:38,707
- No.
- Is mayonnaise an instrument?

228
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:41,444
No, Patrick, mayonnaise
is not an instrument.

229
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:08,871
Is.

230
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:11,107
Dad.

231
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:12,876
Gone.

232
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:17,112
Is Dad gone?

233
00:24:18,513 --> 00:24:20,250
Yes.

234
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:27,891
Hello.

235
00:24:40,002 --> 00:24:42,338
Who.

236
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,107
Are.

237
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:47,877
You.

238
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:50,479
Who are you?

239
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,201
I am Larry.

240
00:25:16,237 --> 00:25:18,840
Your parents want you

241
00:25:18,873 --> 00:25:21,042
to be normal.

242
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:23,513
I just want

243
00:25:23,545 --> 00:25:26,181
to be your friend.

244
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:35,257
Hi, honey.

245
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:39,328
So, I just had a little chat
with Jennifer.

246
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,164
You know how Dr. Robyn's always

247
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:43,198
talking about
you making friends?

248
00:25:43,232 --> 00:25:46,035
Well, we're gonna have
a sleepover this weekend.

249
00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:47,503
I know it's scary.

250
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:49,337
I'm nervous, too.

251
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,842
I haven't really seen Jennifer
since that whole incident,

252
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:56,780
but can you try and have
some fun for me?

253
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:05,888
You noticed your dad's gone
earlier than usual, huh?

254
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,390
I have something
I need to talk to you about.

255
00:26:08,424 --> 00:26:11,093
Um, I've been wanting
to talk to you about it

256
00:26:11,126 --> 00:26:12,862
for a while, but I've just...

257
00:26:12,895 --> 00:26:15,097
I haven't been sure what to say.

258
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:17,999
Your dad and I love you so much.

259
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:20,069
I don't want you to feel alone.

260
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:23,305
That's why we're gonna have
the sleepover this weekend.

261
00:26:44,092 --> 00:26:45,460
Is that your way of saying

262
00:26:45,494 --> 00:26:47,562
you don't want to talk to me
about it?

263
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,122
- Hi.
- Hi.

264
00:27:14,156 --> 00:27:15,590
- How are you?
- Thank you for coming.

265
00:27:15,623 --> 00:27:17,425
- Nice to see you.
- You, too.

266
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:20,897
So, I hope you're gonna be okay
with these guys.

267
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:23,666
They can be a little bit
of a handful.

268
00:27:23,698 --> 00:27:25,301
Oh.

269
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,003
Yeah, I think we'll be fine.

270
00:27:27,035 --> 00:27:29,237
Byron just felt more
comfortable with his posse.

271
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:32,541
- You're welcome to stay for a while.
- Oh.

272
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:34,342
And spend more time with Byron
than I have to?

273
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:35,978
- Mom.
- Yes.

274
00:27:36,011 --> 00:27:38,214
I'm just kidding, honey.

275
00:27:38,246 --> 00:27:40,282
Not kidding.

276
00:27:41,282 --> 00:27:44,654
So, um, can I say hi?

277
00:27:44,686 --> 00:27:46,656
Oh, yeah. Of course, yes.

278
00:27:46,688 --> 00:27:48,323
Yeah.

279
00:27:49,725 --> 00:27:51,526
Oliver.

280
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,561
You remember Jennifer, right?

281
00:27:53,594 --> 00:27:55,163
Hi, Oliver.

282
00:27:56,465 --> 00:27:58,667
Why does he do that
weird thing with his fingers?

283
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:01,070
- Okay, be nice, guys.
- No, it's okay. Um...

284
00:28:01,102 --> 00:28:03,171
It helps calm him down.

285
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:05,174
- It's called stimming.
- Okay.

286
00:28:05,206 --> 00:28:06,574
But why?

287
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:09,712
Well, he's under-sensitive
to stimulation,

288
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:12,180
so sometimes he needs
to touch his own skin

289
00:28:12,214 --> 00:28:15,216
or spin in a circle,
and it makes him feel good.

290
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,520
Can he spin forever
without puking?

291
00:28:17,552 --> 00:28:19,522
Sure seems like it.

292
00:28:19,554 --> 00:28:21,423
That's kind of cool.

293
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:23,126
Come on, Oliver.

294
00:28:24,193 --> 00:28:25,394
Hi, Oliver.

295
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:27,495
It's really nice
to see you, honey.

296
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:29,231
My gosh, you've gotten big.

297
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:31,233
Yeah. Yeah, he's...
he's still not talking,

298
00:28:31,265 --> 00:28:34,003
but his writing
has really improved.

299
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:37,005
- That's awesome.
- Mm-hmm.

300
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,641
High five?

301
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,013
Whoa. Still strong.

302
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:46,247
Okay, that is not gonna happen,

303
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:49,417
because he knows now
to keep his hands to himself.

304
00:28:49,451 --> 00:28:51,320
- Of course.
- Right, Oliver?

305
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:54,489
Well, the boys have
all agreed to include Oliver,

306
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:57,392
so I'm sure it's just gonna be
a really great night.

307
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:23,285
Is he gonna make
those sounds the whole night?

308
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:25,221
Keep it down.

309
00:29:34,128 --> 00:29:36,398
Isn't it sad that your mom
has to force kids

310
00:29:36,432 --> 00:29:38,634
to come over and pretend
to be your friend?

311
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,369
What are you
staring at, anyway?

312
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:43,238
Moaner Boner's been looking
at that closet all night.

313
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:46,274
Maybe that's where he keeps
his secret candy stash.

314
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:49,644
What? Are you guys telling me

315
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:51,414
you don't have
a secret candy stash?

316
00:29:51,446 --> 00:29:53,349
I'm gonna check it out.

317
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:04,460
Do you see any candy?

318
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:22,778
Hey!

319
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:25,080
What's your deal?
We all got these.

320
00:30:25,113 --> 00:30:26,781
Aw, does he think
we're gonna steal it?

321
00:30:26,814 --> 00:30:29,517
Want to see what kind of games
you got on here.

322
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,554
What's this?

323
00:30:32,588 --> 00:30:34,523
Does your mommy still read you
bedtime stories?

324
00:30:39,194 --> 00:30:40,596
"This is Larry."

325
00:30:40,628 --> 00:30:42,465
Who's Larry?

326
00:30:42,497 --> 00:30:44,165
Yeah, who's Larry?

327
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:45,400
This guy.

328
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:47,735
Whoa. Look at that dude.

329
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:49,472
Yeah.
He looks just like your dad.

330
00:30:49,504 --> 00:30:50,738
Shut up.

331
00:30:50,772 --> 00:30:53,208
My dad is way hairier.

332
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:57,378
"Larry never gets to play pretend.

333
00:30:57,411 --> 00:30:59,547
He gets made fun of
because he's different."

334
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,852
Okay, did your parents
forget to pay

335
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:04,720
the electricity bill?

336
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:09,825
"Larry just wants a friend."

337
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:14,396
Are you guys seriously
afraid of a dead light bulb?

338
00:31:16,732 --> 00:31:18,701
Two dead light bulbs.

339
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:35,584
"He's tall and pale and thin

340
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:37,753
"and tries to hide his face.

341
00:31:39,554 --> 00:31:41,623
"He isn't from
the world you know.

342
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:46,494
Larry comes from another place."

343
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:48,764
Uh, maybe we should
stop reading.

344
00:31:55,637 --> 00:31:57,639
"Larry watches
through your windows,

345
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
"which connect
his realm to yours.
"He needs you to know
his whole story
to turn those windows
into doors."
What does that mean?

346
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:10,818
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

347
00:32:10,851 --> 00:32:13,688
Shit! Shit!

348
00:32:13,722 --> 00:32:14,924
Oh, my God.

349
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:16,457
What's going on?

350
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:18,194
Oh, my God!

351
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:23,766
Oh, my God!

352
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,275
Come on.

353
00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:55,731
Are you making
those sounds, Moaner Boner?

354
00:33:52,888 --> 00:33:56,324
What the shit is that?

355
00:33:56,358 --> 00:33:57,859
Shit.

356
00:33:57,892 --> 00:33:59,995
Shit, shit, shit.

357
00:34:06,702 --> 00:34:09,338
- What the hell kind of app is this?
- Is it an app?

358
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:11,507
Should I read the next page?
I'm gonna read the next page.

359
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,442
No, no, no.
Don't read the next page.

360
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:16,045
"Larry has looked
through the glass

361
00:34:16,078 --> 00:34:17,946

362
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:19,814
"He understands your loneliness.

363
00:34:19,848 --> 00:34:21,951
"A true friend is what you lack.

364
00:34:24,752 --> 00:34:26,020
Will you be Larry's friend?"

365
00:34:26,054 --> 00:34:29,925
No! No, I will not
be Larry's friend.

366
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:33,095
Guys, guys, th-there's nothing
in the corner.

367
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:34,696
- No. No, no, no.
- No. No, no, no.

368
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,998
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

369
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:37,632
- Don't! No, don't!
- No, don't! Don't!

370
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:44,439
See?

371
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:50,446
It's probably just a fuse.

372
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Do you see him?
Do you see Larry?
Guys, there's
no such thing as Larry.
It's just your imagination
playing tricks on you.

373
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:09,031
What is happening?

374
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:10,799
Oh, my God!

375
00:35:10,831 --> 00:35:12,868
Byron, are you okay?

376
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,710
I don't know how this happened.

377
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:24,746
I don't see how Oliver
could've done this.

378
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:27,715
Byron, baby?

379
00:35:27,748 --> 00:35:30,118
Do you think you can tell us
what happened now?

380
00:35:30,152 --> 00:35:31,686
Who did this?

381
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:36,825
It was... it was Oliver.

382
00:35:36,857 --> 00:35:39,094
He's a freak.

383
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:43,065
- Excuse me?
- Let's go.

384
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,503
Jennifer, I... I'm sorry.

385
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:49,538
I am so sorry.

386
00:35:49,571 --> 00:35:51,906
We got to go.

387
00:36:09,657 --> 00:36:11,893
How did you blow out
all of these lights?

388
00:36:13,494 --> 00:36:14,763
I don't understand.

389
00:36:14,795 --> 00:36:16,831
Were you trying
to hurt Byron again?

390
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,969
Not you?

391
00:36:22,002 --> 00:36:23,871
Well, who else
could it have been?

392
00:36:23,904 --> 00:36:25,173
You know, if you want friends,

393
00:36:25,206 --> 00:36:26,674
you can't push furniture
into them.

394
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:29,978
Will you at least help me
move this table?

395
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:31,980
Please stop humming.

396
00:36:32,013 --> 00:36:34,016
We are not happy right now.
This...

397
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:38,487
Is that the <i>SpongeBob</i> song?

398
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:01,177
You don't...
you don't have to stop.

399
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:05,014
Does that help you calm down?

400
00:37:06,915 --> 00:37:09,884
Maybe I pushed you
into this too fast.

401
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:13,187
We've got a lot going on
in this house,

402
00:37:13,221 --> 00:37:16,257
and maybe we're just
not ready for friends.

403
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:27,735
Let's fly on over

404
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:29,237
to the Midwestern region.

405
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,607
Which one is this?
North or South Dakota?

406
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:34,042
South Dakota.

407
00:37:34,074 --> 00:37:35,710
That's right.

408
00:37:35,743 --> 00:37:39,146
Underneath South Dakota is...?

409
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:42,250
- Nebraska?
- Nebraska.

410
00:37:42,284 --> 00:37:44,286
Jade, what's under Nebraska?

411
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:45,786
Kansas.

412
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:47,855
Kansas. Nice one.

413
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:51,059
Oliver, do you want
to give this one a try?

414
00:37:51,092 --> 00:37:53,596
Oliver, did you bring
your talker today?

415
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,600
Another day.

416
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:01,569
And under Kansas?

417
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:04,172
Oklahoma?

Hello?

425
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,810
Hello?

426
00:41:30,277 --> 00:41:31,812
Hello.

427
00:41:41,522 --> 00:41:44,325
Is somebody watching me?

428
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:47,496
Oliver, what the hell
did you download on this thing?

429
00:41:47,529 --> 00:41:51,433
Say goodbye to Oliver.

430
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:53,400
Have you been talking to my son?

431
00:41:53,433 --> 00:41:56,203
You need to stop.
This is not funny.

432
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:06,415
Stay away from my son.
I won't let you hurt him.

433
00:42:07,514 --> 00:42:09,752
Not hurt.

434
00:42:12,085 --> 00:42:14,355
Take.

435
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:15,857
Take, take,

436
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:18,192
take, take, take, take.

437
00:42:29,036 --> 00:42:32,507
Why? To collect and...

438
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:36,377
- Everything okay?
- Sorry. Uh, Oliver?

439
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:38,446
- Is Oliver here?
- Yeah.

440
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:40,381
Thank God you're all right.

441
00:42:40,415 --> 00:42:42,150
We got to go.

442
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:47,121
We have a family emergency,
so we're just gonna go.

443
00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:53,561
We just got to get you home,
okay?

444
00:42:53,594 --> 00:42:56,464
I know. I know this isn't
part of your routine.

445
00:42:56,496 --> 00:42:58,533
It's just...

446
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:02,369
Someone was watching us at home.

447
00:43:02,402 --> 00:43:04,973
They said they want to take you.

448
00:43:05,005 --> 00:43:07,275
Oh.

449
00:43:09,444 --> 00:43:12,114
Hi. Jen, I can't...

450
00:43:13,647 --> 00:43:16,250
What do you mean,
he's not talking?

451
00:43:17,552 --> 00:43:20,488
I don't know what
they got up to this weekend,

452
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,924
but Byron,
he still hasn't slept.

453
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,327
Won't go to school.

454
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,429
Won't eat.

455
00:43:27,462 --> 00:43:29,431
Two days with him not talking,
and...

456
00:43:29,464 --> 00:43:31,400
I seriously don't know
how you do it.

457
00:43:33,134 --> 00:43:36,471
I think someone hacked
into Oliver's screen.

458
00:43:36,503 --> 00:43:39,241
Someone was talking to me.

459
00:43:47,915 --> 00:43:50,951
SpongeBob, I just want
to say that I'm...

460
00:43:50,985 --> 00:43:53,021
sorry.

461
00:43:53,054 --> 00:43:54,122
What?

462
00:43:54,154 --> 00:43:57,359
I'm trying to say I'm...

463
00:43:59,594 --> 00:44:01,429
What?

464
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:03,898
I mean, how could someone
use that to get to...

465
00:44:08,268 --> 00:44:10,437
Honey, it's nice of you
to try and apologize,

466
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:13,308
but I don't think he wants
to watch <i>SpongeBob</i> right now.

467
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,509
It was Larry.

468
00:44:16,043 --> 00:44:17,612
Honey?

469
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,049
Oliver didn't do anything.

470
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:22,417
It was Larry.

471
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:23,685
Who's Larry?

472
00:44:23,717 --> 00:44:27,554
I read about Larry today
in that story.

473
00:44:27,587 --> 00:44:30,457
Tell me what you saw, please.

474
00:44:30,491 --> 00:44:32,393
Larry just wants a friend.

475
00:44:32,427 --> 00:44:35,330
H-He made the lights go out.

476
00:44:37,297 --> 00:44:39,533
I-I could hear him in the house.

477
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:42,536
H-He moved things, but...

478
00:44:42,569 --> 00:44:44,906
but I couldn't see him.

479
00:44:45,706 --> 00:44:47,574
Not really.

480
00:44:47,607 --> 00:44:50,077
So, you guys
played make-believe?

481
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:51,545
No.

482
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
He's the one that hurt me,
not Oliver.
Larry.
I could feel him.
His hands around my neck.

483
00:45:08,128 --> 00:45:10,098
He tried to kill me.

484
00:45:12,266 --> 00:45:14,036
Larry just wants a friend.

485
00:45:15,036 --> 00:45:16,938
Larry just wants a friend.

486
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:19,574
Larry just wants a friend.

487
00:45:20,574 --> 00:45:22,944
<i>Larry just wants a friend.</i>

488
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:28,382
Hurry! Oliver!

489
00:45:28,415 --> 00:45:30,952
We got to get to Dad.
We can't stay here.

490
00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:38,326
Honey, I'm sure it's nothing,
but better to be safe, right?

491
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:40,194
Can you look at me?

492
00:45:43,498 --> 00:45:45,701
We should get going, okay?

493
00:45:47,235 --> 00:45:49,271
And no screens.

494
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

495
00:47:50,491 --> 00:47:52,159
Oliver!

496
00:48:26,393 --> 00:48:28,795
What are you talking about?

497
00:48:28,828 --> 00:48:31,198
I know it sounds crazy,

498
00:48:31,232 --> 00:48:33,768
but I was reading this story
about Larry,

499
00:48:33,801 --> 00:48:35,770
and then the lights...

500
00:48:35,802 --> 00:48:38,306
they started going on and off.

501
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:42,143
And then another one
was going on and off.

502
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:45,779
It was like he was using
the electricity

503
00:48:45,813 --> 00:48:47,382
to move around the room.

504
00:48:47,415 --> 00:48:50,851
And then he screwed in
all the new light bulbs.

505
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:53,220
So, he helped you
with your chores.

506
00:48:54,922 --> 00:48:59,293
He must have needed the power
or something to come alive.

507
00:48:59,326 --> 00:49:01,362
- Larry?
- Larry.

508
00:49:02,496 --> 00:49:04,766
I knew I shouldn't
have moved out.

509
00:49:05,766 --> 00:49:07,534
I'm not making this up.

510
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:09,836
Oliver saw him.

511
00:49:09,869 --> 00:49:15,275
There is something
inside our house.

512
00:49:15,308 --> 00:49:18,345
O-Oliver, here.

513
00:49:18,378 --> 00:49:19,915
Tell Daddy.

514
00:49:23,317 --> 00:49:24,953
He.

515
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:26,920
Wants. Me.

516
00:49:26,953 --> 00:49:29,456
As. Friend.

517
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:32,560
This thing wants our son.

518
00:49:32,592 --> 00:49:34,395
Okay.

519
00:49:34,427 --> 00:49:37,331
I think you need
a good night's sleep.

520
00:49:37,364 --> 00:49:38,966
I'll take him to school
in the morning.

521
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,402
No, I am not letting him
out of our sight.

522
00:49:41,435 --> 00:49:43,270
How do we know
the school is safe?

523
00:49:43,304 --> 00:49:45,673
Okay, well, why don't I bring
him to work with me tonight

524
00:49:45,706 --> 00:49:47,242
if he's not going
to school tomorrow?

525
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,710
Absolutely not.

526
00:49:48,743 --> 00:49:50,744
Oh, come on. What, you don't
trust me with him?

527
00:49:50,777 --> 00:49:52,546
No, it's not that. It's...

528
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,882
Rest is important for the body.

529
00:49:55,915 --> 00:49:58,485
So, you sleep, and...

530
00:49:58,518 --> 00:50:00,955
we can talk about
all this tomorrow.

531
00:50:02,556 --> 00:50:04,891
Really, come on.

532
00:50:04,924 --> 00:50:07,261
Let me take care of him.

533
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,770
Give this and the change
to the gentleman.

534
00:50:16,804 --> 00:50:18,673
There you go.

535
00:50:18,706 --> 00:50:20,341
Thanks so much.

536
00:50:20,373 --> 00:50:22,909
Have a good one.

537
00:50:22,942 --> 00:50:25,279
My man is a pro!

538
00:50:26,846 --> 00:50:28,782
Very nicely done.

539
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:31,319
See? Look how good
you are at that.

540
00:50:31,351 --> 00:50:33,754
You could take over for me some nights.

541
00:50:33,788 --> 00:50:34,989
The best part is that,
in between cars,

542
00:50:35,022 --> 00:50:36,023
you can do whatever you want.

543
00:50:36,056 --> 00:50:38,058
You can listen to the radio.

544
00:50:38,092 --> 00:50:40,328
You can even watch <i>SpongeBob.</i>

545
00:50:47,868 --> 00:50:49,471
Oh, hey.

546
00:50:50,705 --> 00:50:53,808
Ah. Is this the infamous haunted screen?

547
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,842
It's okay.

548
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:58,612
Hey. Do you know how
your nightmares aren't real?

549
00:50:58,645 --> 00:51:02,015
Well, neither are ghosts or
ghouls or vampires or witches,

550
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:04,052
and certainly not Larrys.

551
00:51:04,085 --> 00:51:06,621
"This is Larry."

552
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,857
"Will you be Larry's friend?"

553
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:05,413
It's nothing.

554
00:52:05,446 --> 00:52:07,014
Happens all the time.

555
00:52:07,047 --> 00:52:09,016
It's okay.

556
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:11,919
Huh.

557
00:52:14,554 --> 00:52:15,857
Hang tight.

558
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:33,407
All right.

559
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:38,645
Let's see what we have here.

560
00:55:16,936 --> 00:55:18,739
Oliver, what are you doing, buddy?

561
00:55:18,772 --> 00:55:20,975
What if a car drove in? Huh?

562
00:55:21,007 --> 00:55:23,043
You got to be more careful.

563
00:55:28,382 --> 00:55:29,850
Hey. Here.

564
00:55:29,882 --> 00:55:31,085
Give me this.

565
00:55:31,118 --> 00:55:32,953
Look. Hey.

566
00:55:32,987 --> 00:55:34,221
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Look.

567
00:55:34,253 --> 00:55:36,022
Buddy, there's nothing.

568
00:55:36,056 --> 00:55:37,592
Hey. Look at me.

569
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:40,194
Okay? There's nothing out there.

570
00:55:40,226 --> 00:55:42,330
Okay? I'll show you. Look.

571
00:55:44,897 --> 00:55:47,033
See?

572
00:55:47,067 --> 00:55:48,703
Look at that.

573
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:58,878
See?

574
00:56:00,279 --> 00:56:01,915
Totally safe.

575
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Oliver!
Let him go!

576
00:56:30,944 --> 00:56:32,913
Okay.

577
00:56:32,946 --> 00:56:36,183
Okay. Okay.

578
00:56:36,215 --> 00:56:39,786
I saw through that-that...
that screen

579
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:42,122
the way he was holding Oliver.

580
00:56:42,156 --> 00:56:44,358
Why does he want our son?

581
00:56:44,391 --> 00:56:47,427
The story said something,
um, about, uh...

582
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,229
"A true friend
is what you lack."

583
00:56:49,263 --> 00:56:52,433
He hasn't had a friend
since-since...

584
00:56:52,465 --> 00:56:55,168
Oh, yeah, since Jennifer and I
got in our fight.

585
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:57,337
- I know.
- Yeah, some stupid fight.

586
00:56:57,371 --> 00:56:59,006
Hey, Oliver hit Byron,

587
00:56:59,038 --> 00:57:01,375
and then she decided
our son was dangerous.

588
00:57:02,976 --> 00:57:05,146
Either way, he's been lonely
long before that.

589
00:57:05,179 --> 00:57:06,714
I mean, Oliver's been staring

590
00:57:06,746 --> 00:57:08,449
at his screens for years,
and that...

591
00:57:08,482 --> 00:57:10,851
that thing has been
staring right back.

592
00:57:10,884 --> 00:57:12,719
And how come
we can't see it, huh?

593
00:57:12,752 --> 00:57:14,220
I-I don't know.

594
00:57:14,253 --> 00:57:15,989
Doesn't make any sense.

595
00:57:16,022 --> 00:57:18,892
How-how can he be here
and not here at the same time?

596
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:21,962
What have you got, honey?

597
00:57:22,962 --> 00:57:25,365
That's very nice.

598
00:57:43,449 --> 00:57:45,218
We got some kid.

599
00:57:45,252 --> 00:57:47,955
Larry's in his world,
and we're in ours, but...

600
00:57:47,987 --> 00:57:50,223
But we're also together.

601
00:57:50,257 --> 00:57:54,095
Larry can interact with us,
but he can't reach us.

602
00:57:54,127 --> 00:57:55,962
He can't get to Oliver yet.

603
00:57:55,996 --> 00:57:58,232
That's why he wants
to get into our world.

604
00:57:58,264 --> 00:58:01,101
If that's his window...

605
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:04,104
Then we have to destroy it
before it becomes his door.

606
00:58:39,373 --> 00:58:41,942
We have the cookie,
we have the blue car,

607
00:58:41,975 --> 00:58:45,011
and you get to choose...
whichever one you want.

608
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:46,880
What's it gonna be?

609
00:58:46,913 --> 00:58:48,214
Yeah. Good.

610
00:58:48,248 --> 00:58:50,384
Marty and I
both experienced it.

611
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:53,052
It's not just
in Oliver's imagination.

612
00:58:53,085 --> 00:58:54,988
I'll be right back, kiddo.

613
00:58:57,523 --> 00:59:02,996
Sarah, do you know
what a physical empath is?

614
00:59:03,029 --> 00:59:04,430
No.

615
00:59:04,464 --> 00:59:07,835
It's when you love
someone so much

616
00:59:07,868 --> 00:59:10,571
that you feel or experience
their pain.

617
00:59:10,603 --> 00:59:12,205
It's a good sign.

618
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:14,175
It shows just how much
you care about Oliver.

619
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:16,277
And it's very common in parents.

620
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:19,947
So, you're saying that we could
be seeing his imagination

621
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,415
because we love him?

622
00:59:21,447 --> 00:59:23,183
That doesn't make any sense.

623
00:59:23,217 --> 00:59:24,585
But an invisible monster

624
00:59:24,618 --> 00:59:26,554
that travels
through electricity does?

625
00:59:28,621 --> 00:59:30,924
Well, we're hoping
that that's over now

626
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,526
because we destroyed that thing.

627
00:59:32,558 --> 00:59:36,062
So, does he have a way
to communicate?

628
00:59:37,063 --> 00:59:38,565
I'll...

629
00:59:38,598 --> 00:59:40,867
let him take my phone
with him to school

630
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,837
until we can afford a new one.

631
00:59:42,869 --> 00:59:44,904
Unless you could get him
talking first.

632
00:59:44,938 --> 00:59:46,607
Sarah.

633
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:48,609
Come on, it's...

634
00:59:48,641 --> 00:59:51,011
it's extremely rare
for kids his age

635
00:59:51,043 --> 00:59:53,480
to start verbalizing in the way
I fear you're imagining.

636
00:59:53,513 --> 00:59:56,616
I know. I know.

637
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,987
I just...
I just want to make sure

638
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,389
that you still have
the right expectations.

639
01:00:02,422 --> 01:00:04,558
If he can say a few words...

640
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,594
maybe a sentence here or there...

641
01:00:06,627 --> 01:00:08,596
that would be a big win.

642
01:00:08,628 --> 01:00:12,266
We have to keep remembering
his strengths.

643
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:20,141
Have you seen him again?

644
01:00:30,284 --> 01:00:32,320
What's this?

645
01:00:33,453 --> 01:00:35,522
He. Gave.

646
01:00:35,554 --> 01:00:39,326
It. To. Me.

647
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,628
Seriously?

648
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:43,330
Yes.

649
01:00:43,362 --> 01:00:48,067
Then Mom and Dad broke him.

650
01:00:48,101 --> 01:00:50,170
Broke him?

651
01:00:50,203 --> 01:00:53,172
S-So, like, he's gone, then?

652
01:00:53,206 --> 01:00:55,376
Yes.

653
01:01:09,556 --> 01:01:12,092
Can I ask you something?

654
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:13,393
Yes.

655
01:01:13,427 --> 01:01:16,130
Why'd you stop being my friend?

656
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:20,368
We used to hang out
all the time.

657
01:01:22,368 --> 01:01:25,138
I. Did.

658
01:01:25,172 --> 01:01:27,273
Bad. Thing.

659
01:01:27,306 --> 01:01:28,641
You did?

660
01:01:28,674 --> 01:01:31,077
Punch. Face.

661
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:34,248
Your. Mom. Mad.

662
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:36,350
I barely even had a bruise.

663
01:01:36,382 --> 01:01:38,217
The next day,
I was asking my mom

664
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,321
when we could have
another sleepover.

665
01:01:40,353 --> 01:01:43,256
But she played me
a message from your mom.

666
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:46,060
Your mom said you didn't want
to be my friend anymore.

667
01:01:49,261 --> 01:01:52,332
That is lie.

668
01:01:52,366 --> 01:01:53,967
Wait.

669
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,502
So, you never said that?

670
01:01:56,536 --> 01:01:58,973
Lie.

671
01:01:59,005 --> 01:02:00,674
Wrong.

672
01:02:00,706 --> 01:02:03,076
I never.

673
01:02:05,277 --> 01:02:06,647
Lie.

674
01:02:09,549 --> 01:02:11,552
Moms are so weird.

675
01:02:11,585 --> 01:02:13,420
What are you watching
over there?

676
01:02:13,453 --> 01:02:14,655
Wait.

677
01:02:14,688 --> 01:02:16,423
Let me guess.

678
01:02:16,456 --> 01:02:18,258
<i>SpongeBob?</i>

679
01:02:50,156 --> 01:02:51,424
No.

680
01:04:20,313 --> 01:04:21,682
No!

681
01:04:23,282 --> 01:04:24,750
Help!

682
01:04:24,784 --> 01:04:26,386
Hello!

683
01:04:26,418 --> 01:04:28,254
Somebody help!

684
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

685
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,342
Where are you?

686
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:04,978
No!

687
01:07:05,011 --> 01:07:07,346
Shit.

688
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

689
01:07:44,817 --> 01:07:46,919
You need any help
with your homework?

690
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:53,793
Hey, I talked to Jennifer today.

691
01:07:53,826 --> 01:07:56,462
She said Byron's doing
much better.

692
01:08:06,105 --> 01:08:07,741
Hello?

693
01:08:09,509 --> 01:08:11,110
How?

694
01:08:11,143 --> 01:08:13,679
We found him in his
car on the side of the road.

695
01:08:13,712 --> 01:08:16,782
We're not sure how it happened.
He was unresponsive.

696
01:08:16,816 --> 01:08:18,919
W-We rushed him
to the hospital...

697
01:08:18,951 --> 01:08:21,387
Hello?

698
01:08:25,657 --> 01:08:26,959
Hello?

699
01:08:26,993 --> 01:08:28,995
Hello!

700
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:50,717
Welcome to the Krusty Krab.

701
01:08:50,749 --> 01:08:53,018
How may I help you?

702
01:08:53,052 --> 01:08:54,955
- Yeah...
- Did you turn it on?

703
01:08:54,987 --> 01:08:56,990
...two large fries
and a Jumbo Krabby Patty.

704
01:08:57,022 --> 01:08:58,657
Hey! What's that?

705
01:09:00,192 --> 01:09:02,161
What are you doing
behind the counter?!

706
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:12,539
- He...
- Will...

707
01:09:12,571 --> 01:09:13,873
- Follow...
- You...

708
01:09:15,008 --> 01:09:16,676
- Until...
- You...

709
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:17,844
- Finish...
- The...

710
01:09:17,877 --> 01:09:20,914
Story.

711
01:09:20,946 --> 01:09:23,549
Why are you doing this to us?

712
01:09:25,084 --> 01:09:27,121
Where did you come from?

713
01:09:32,691 --> 01:09:34,660
- World...
- Only...

714
01:09:34,694 --> 01:09:36,196
- Look...
- At...

715
01:09:36,228 --> 01:09:38,197
- Screens...
- Not...

716
01:09:38,231 --> 01:09:39,532
Each other.

717
01:09:39,566 --> 01:09:41,802
What?

718
01:09:41,834 --> 01:09:44,036
What does that mean?

719
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:46,139
- People...
- Very...

720
01:09:46,172 --> 01:09:47,040
Lonely.

721
01:09:47,072 --> 01:09:49,109
- All...
- That...

722
01:09:49,142 --> 01:09:50,710
- Loneliness...
- In...

723
01:09:50,743 --> 01:09:52,846
- World...
- Made...

724
01:09:52,879 --> 01:09:54,815
Larry.

725
01:09:54,847 --> 01:09:56,682
- Larry...
- Made...

726
01:09:56,715 --> 01:09:58,986
- Of...
- Loneliness.

727
01:10:00,085 --> 01:10:02,054
Larry is lonely?

728
01:10:03,255 --> 01:10:07,593
How do you think I would feel
if Larry took Oliver?

729
01:10:12,731 --> 01:10:14,133
- Finish...
- The...

730
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:15,535
Story.

731
01:10:15,567 --> 01:10:16,936
- Finish...
- The...

732
01:10:16,969 --> 01:10:18,038
Story.

733
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:19,205
No.

734
01:10:25,879 --> 01:10:27,681
No, no, no, no.

735
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:40,627
No. Stop. Stop.

736
01:11:00,847 --> 01:11:02,581
No. No!

737
01:11:02,615 --> 01:11:03,851
No.

738
01:11:55,133 --> 01:11:58,804
Can you just be normal
for one second?

739
01:12:05,044 --> 01:12:06,746
Oliver.

740
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:08,848
Oliver, I didn't mean it.

741
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:13,654
Honey.

742
01:12:15,288 --> 01:12:17,691
Sometimes...

743
01:12:17,723 --> 01:12:20,726
even moms and dads say things
that they shouldn't.

744
01:12:22,762 --> 01:12:24,731
I just... I...

745
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:29,369
Your dad...

746
01:12:29,401 --> 01:12:33,639
he's been in an accident,
and, um...

747
01:12:33,673 --> 01:12:35,842
they're trying to wake him up.

748
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:42,014
Something happened to him,
and I think it was Larry.

749
01:12:42,048 --> 01:12:45,085
And I cannot let Larry
get us, too.

750
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:14,313
Oh, my God.

751
01:14:49,075 --> 01:14:52,946
Okay. Okay. Okay.

752
01:15:20,272 --> 01:15:22,808
We're gonna go for the door.

753
01:15:22,842 --> 01:15:25,044
Stay quiet.

754
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:51,404
Oliver.

755
01:15:51,437 --> 01:15:53,907
If something happens to us...

756
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:57,811
...I don't want you to think

757
01:15:57,843 --> 01:16:00,279
that I meant
what I said downstairs.

758
01:16:09,088 --> 01:16:11,057
What did I lie about?

759
01:16:12,357 --> 01:16:14,060
Byron?

760
01:16:15,061 --> 01:16:16,196
Oh, honey, I...

761
01:16:16,228 --> 01:16:18,431
You hit him out of nowhere.

762
01:16:18,463 --> 01:16:20,966
I thought it would be
easier for everyone

763
01:16:20,999 --> 01:16:22,468
if I just cut ties.

764
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:26,972
"You took away...

765
01:16:28,507 --> 01:16:31,044
"...friend.

766
01:16:31,076 --> 01:16:33,312
"Now I...

767
01:16:33,346 --> 01:16:35,549
go with..."

768
01:16:38,551 --> 01:16:40,853
No. No, don't...
d-don't go with Larry.

769
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:42,188
You're right.

770
01:16:42,221 --> 01:16:43,556
I did lie.

771
01:16:43,588 --> 01:16:45,490
And I didn't do it...

772
01:16:45,523 --> 01:16:48,527
Honey, I didn't do it
to protect you.

773
01:16:48,561 --> 01:16:51,598
I did it to protect me.

774
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,634
Oliver.

775
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:58,036
Can you look at me, please?

776
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,574
Please, can you look at me?

777
01:17:03,008 --> 01:17:04,576
It's okay.

778
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:06,980
I know you're listening.

779
01:17:07,012 --> 01:17:09,148
You're always listening.

780
01:17:12,551 --> 01:17:15,155
Much more than I listen to you.

781
01:17:31,137 --> 01:17:32,572
Oliver.

782
01:17:43,648 --> 01:17:45,218
Oliver.

783
01:17:46,252 --> 01:17:48,254
Hey.

784
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:28,128
Oliver.

785
01:18:38,404 --> 01:18:41,975
Come...

786
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:44,511
play.

787
01:19:19,145 --> 01:19:21,481
Friend.

788
01:19:25,151 --> 01:19:28,088
Friend...

789
01:19:40,266 --> 01:19:42,634
F...

790
01:19:42,668 --> 01:19:44,670
F...

791
01:19:47,572 --> 01:19:49,575
F...

792
01:19:51,142 --> 01:19:53,779
F...

793
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fie-ld.
Field, field, field, field.
Field, field, field,
field, field...

794
01:20:08,259 --> 01:20:10,062
No! No!

795
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:13,532
Oliver!

796
01:20:26,579 --> 01:20:28,447
Field, field, field, field,
field, field, field, field.

797
01:20:28,481 --> 01:20:30,850
Why the field?

798
01:21:38,383 --> 01:21:40,585
There's no electricity here.

799
01:21:40,619 --> 01:21:42,255
He can't get us.

800
01:21:42,288 --> 01:21:43,857
Hey.

801
01:21:57,703 --> 01:21:58,737
Hey.

802
01:21:58,771 --> 01:21:59,871
Oh, you did it.

803
01:21:59,905 --> 01:22:01,641
You did it.

804
01:22:01,673 --> 01:22:02,841
You saved us.

805
01:22:02,874 --> 01:22:04,377
Oh!

806
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Run!

807
01:22:34,306 --> 01:22:35,741
Run! Come on!

808
01:22:35,773 --> 01:22:37,209
Run!

809
01:23:01,566 --> 01:23:03,703
Stop! No, Oliver!

810
01:23:03,736 --> 01:23:05,938
No.

811
01:23:05,971 --> 01:23:07,272
Oliver.

812
01:23:11,442 --> 01:23:13,445
Oliver!

813
01:23:19,884 --> 01:23:21,686
No!

814
01:23:23,955 --> 01:23:25,924
Oliver!

815
01:24:18,043 --> 01:24:21,580
Friends.

816
01:25:14,732 --> 01:25:16,601
I'll be your friend, Larry.

817
01:25:18,669 --> 01:25:21,639
We both want the same thing.

818
01:25:21,673 --> 01:25:24,410
We both want to protect Oliver.

819
01:25:42,527 --> 01:25:44,496
I love you.

820
01:25:45,998 --> 01:25:48,000
I love all of you.

821
01:27:31,069 --> 01:27:32,571
Good.

822
01:27:32,603 --> 01:27:35,007
Now, you want to give it a try?

823
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,209
M...

824
01:27:38,243 --> 01:27:40,646
Mom...

825
01:27:40,678 --> 01:27:43,214
"Mom." Excellent.

826
01:27:43,248 --> 01:27:47,620
Loves...

827
01:27:49,288 --> 01:27:51,624
M...

828
01:27:51,656 --> 01:27:54,226
Me.

829
01:27:54,258 --> 01:27:55,694
Wonderful.

830
01:27:55,727 --> 01:27:57,696
"Mom loves me."

831
01:27:57,728 --> 01:28:00,165
I know for a fact
your mom loves you very much.

832
01:28:01,667 --> 01:28:03,134
You're so good with him.

833
01:28:03,168 --> 01:28:05,905
So are you.

834
01:28:05,937 --> 01:28:08,007
How's he doing at home?

835
01:28:09,674 --> 01:28:11,209
He seems okay.

836
01:28:12,678 --> 01:28:14,246
I've been trying to give him

837
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:16,749
more social experiences,
like you said.

838
01:28:16,781 --> 01:28:18,717
Uh, we've been practicing
his speech,

839
01:28:18,749 --> 01:28:21,085
like, uh, five times a day.

840
01:28:21,119 --> 01:28:23,188
Well, you don't want
to wear him out.

841
01:28:23,221 --> 01:28:25,257
Let's say three times a day.

842
01:28:25,289 --> 01:28:28,192
Oh. Okay.

843
01:28:28,226 --> 01:28:30,295
Got it.

844
01:28:33,065 --> 01:28:35,134
Three times a day.

845
01:28:36,368 --> 01:28:39,737
For speech work.

846
01:28:45,377 --> 01:28:48,246
I mean, you know Sarah...
she was...

847
01:28:50,214 --> 01:28:51,883
...incredible.

848
01:28:54,352 --> 01:28:57,989
I thought I understood, but I...

849
01:29:05,262 --> 01:29:08,299
I just wish I could tell her

850
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:10,570
that I'm sorry.

851
01:29:12,838 --> 01:29:14,740
That I'm trying now.

852
01:29:16,741 --> 01:29:19,044
I'm sure she'd like
to hear that.

853
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:22,615
I hope...

854
01:29:22,647 --> 01:29:24,282
they'll find her.

855
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:36,795
Is that you?

856
01:29:44,369 --> 01:29:47,039
- Hey.
- Hey.

857
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:50,743
Can I, uh...

858
01:29:50,776 --> 01:29:53,245
eat lunch with you guys
tomorrow or something?

859
01:29:53,277 --> 01:29:55,414
That depends.

860
01:29:55,446 --> 01:29:57,815
Are you willing
to take the pledge?

861
01:29:57,848 --> 01:29:59,819
What pledge?

862
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,657
A secret handshake.

863
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:07,759
For those of us
who've seen Larry.

864
01:30:07,793 --> 01:30:10,696
The pledge to stay friends.

865
01:30:10,728 --> 01:30:12,364
To play together forever.

866
01:30:12,396 --> 01:30:16,134
<i>So no one has to be alone
like Larry.</i>

867
01:32:13,317 --> 01:32:15,420
I'll protect you.

868
01:32:25,227 --> 01:32:30,227
