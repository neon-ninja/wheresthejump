00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,356
Daddy, I heard something.

3
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,816
-Oh, yeah? What'd you hear?
-A noise.

4
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,820
It's just us working.

5
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,322
Why can't I come in with you?

6
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,741
'Cause I said so.
Ain't a place for kids.

7
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,409
We're almost done now.

8
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,329
Do not leave this truck.
Or drive off with it.

9
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,456
You hear me?

10
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,628
Go and put that in the glove box.

11
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,506
I'll be right back, bud.

12
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,424
Love you!

13
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,594
I'll finish up
and we'll go get your brother, Lucas.

14
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,846
All right, let's get outta here.

15
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,945
Hey, Frank, we still got plenty
to do one more batch if you want.

16
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,957
The fuck was that?

17
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,125
Listen.

18
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,468
You said they weren't gonna reopen this place
for another few weeks.

19
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,180
The fuck is that, Frank?

20
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,644
That's gotta be an animal.

21
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,943
Fuck me.

22
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,030
-The fuck you going, Frank?
-Come on.

23
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,782
Fuck.

24
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,670
The fuck is going on?

25
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,341
Where you going?

26
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,469
Frank.

27
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,473
Fuck.

28
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,442
Frank, let's get the fuck
outta here, all right?

29
00:05:58,609 --> 00:05:59,651
Let's get the fuck outta here.

30
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,778
Something's on fucking fire, man.

31
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,073
Frank!

32
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,285
Let's get the fuck outta here, buddy.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

33
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,412
This is fucked up, man.

34
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,122
Where you going?

35
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,416
Let's get the fuck outta here.

36
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,543
Frank!

37
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,754
Run, Frank, run!

38
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,299
Oh, my God!

39
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,426
Frank!

40
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,389
Kenny!

41
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,501
Daddy?

42
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,296
Daddy?

43
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,667
I'll be right out.

44
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,313
It's obviously much more than just that.

45
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,482
Would anyone like to help him elaborate?

46
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:09,531
So, storytelling is a way for people
to explain their world...

47
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,783
their culture...

48
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,995
passing on customs and beliefs
from one generation to the next.

49
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,832
In America, and especially here in Oregon...

50
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,169
storytelling started with
our indigenous people.

51
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,839
Native Americans who were teaching
the younger people...

52
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,176
in their communities
about their culture and identities.

53
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:34,431
Can anyone give me an example
of a fable or a myth?

54
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,975
Or a fairy tale even.

55
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,354
Brody, give it a shot.

56
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,610
Evie, do you have any stories
you wanna share?

57
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,863
Lucas.

58
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,573
Give me an example of...

59
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,369
a fable or a myth.

60
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,537
Come on.

61
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,249
Anyone? Anyone?

62
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,168
Okay. Go ahead, Jasmine.

63
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,838
"Goldilocks."
"Goldilocks" is a fairy tale.

64
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,005
That's very good.

65
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,632
What's the story of "Goldilocks"?

66
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,716
Lucas.

67
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,635
While a family of bears are away...

68
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:15,264
Goldilocks enters their house
and eats their porridge.

69
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,724
Then the bears come home
and get angry with her.

70
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,143
That's right. Very good.

71
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,771
So, is there a moral or a lesson
in that story?

72
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:23,939
Yes.

73
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,732
Don't eat bears' food without permission.

74
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,361
That's right.
Don't take something that's not yours.

75
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,614
Hey, everyone, be prepared to discuss
and write about...

76
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,076
a fairy tale or a myth when you come back.

77
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,522
Guys, let's go.

78
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,470
Here you go, ma'am. Nice to see ya.

79
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:10,105
That'll be $3.

80
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,110
Is that everything?

81
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,328
That'll be $4.50, please.

82
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:30,000
<i>...have already begun rolling back
environmental regulations.</i>

83
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,587
<i>Today, an EPA spokesman
announced a comprehensive plan...</i>

84
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:38,800
<i>to revive the coal industry by promoting
what is known as mountaintop mining.</i>

85
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,136
<i>In remote Cispus Falls, Oregon...</i>

86
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:45,849
<i>the Greymouth Mine is one of a handful

87
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,144
<i>ending what they say
is a war on American energy.</i>

88
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,877
Hey, sis.

89
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:57,880
How was school?

90
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,759
It's about the same.

91
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,556
Just give it time.
They'll warm to you.

92
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,560
I'm not sure it's about warming.

93
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,774
It's just not... what I hoped it would be.

94
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,492
You want me to move that out of here?

95
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,834
All right, I'm gonna try
and get some sleep. Good night.

96
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,085
Good night.

97
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,607
Boy.

98
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,452
<i>Opioid epidemic persists in rural Oregon.</i>

99
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,882
The basket by the phone.

100
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,933
Can you not move my stuff, please?

101
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,436
I have it all where it is,
so I know where it is.

102
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,648
Sorry. Yeah.

103
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,863
I was just trying to give us more space.

104
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,699
I'm gonna move out as soon as I can.

105
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,786
Jules, I didn't say anything
about moving out.

106
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,545
I'm sorry.
I'm just getting ready to go evict...

107
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,548
another family with kids.

108
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,843
Give 'em 10, 15 minutes...

109
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,928
to grab what they can carry,
throw it in their car...

110
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,597
if they have a car, and then...

111
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,018
I wish you wouldn't have run, Paul.
You didn't have to.

112
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,979
There weren't exactly too many people...

113
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:47,025
banging down the doors for the position
after Warren Stokes retired.

114
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,991
I barely recognize this place anymore.

115
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:59,913
Yeah, well, a lot can change in 20 years.

116
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,461
It's our own little slice of paradise here.

117
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,682
<i>Who's next?</i>

118
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,311
Lucas.

119
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,771
You wanna read us your story?

120
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,398
He can't read, Ms. Meadows.

121
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:27,858
-Clint.
-Yes, he can.

122
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,528
I know you've been working on a story.

123
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,989
Will you read us a little bit?

124
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:50,797
Once, there were three bears...

125
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:54,384
that lived in a dark and wet cave...

126
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,887
up above a small town.

127
00:18:57,054 --> 00:19:00,891
Big Bear, Little Bear, and Baby Bear.

128
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,855
Big Bear used to take care
of the little bears.

129
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,691
But Big Bear got sick.

130
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,570
Lost his job.

131
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,406
And his insides turned black.

132
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,997
One day, Little Bear came home...

133
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:27,417
and Big Bear and Baby Bear were different.

134
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,755
Big Bear's sickness had gotten worse.

135
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:36,885
Big Bear has become
more angrier and meaner...

136
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,348
because they had no food.

137
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,100
No meat.

138
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,857
It's very good, Lucas.

139
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,486
But they had each other.

140
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,463
You know he belongs there, right?

141
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:19,094
Oh, my God! Is that dog shit?

142
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,972
God, dude. That smells like ass. God.

143
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,767
What kind of a person
would put that in there?

144
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:31,565
You motherfucker!
You think this is funny? Eat it!

145
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,360
Fight! Fight! Fight!

146
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,613
-Clint! Hey! Clint, stop!
-Eat it!

147
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,072
Does that hurt?

148
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:43,702
Okay.

149
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,539
Okay, you put your shirt back on.

150
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,546
I'll be right out.

151
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:07,846
Hey. I was just about to go in there.
You wanna join me?

152
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,392
That's not why I invited you in.

153
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,562
I invited you in to have ice cream...

154
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:19,733
because I wanted to know
if ice cream is your favorite vegetable.

155
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:22,236
Because it's mine.

156
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:24,821
Ice cream isn't a vegetable.

157
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,073
Yeah, it is.

158
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,699
It's a dessert.

159
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:30,285
To most people, yeah.
But to me?

160
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:32,538
Totally a vegetable.

161
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:40,128
So, if ice cream is a vegetable,
what's your favorite fruit?

162
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:43,757
Come on.

163
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,218
Donuts?

164
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:49,429
Mine too. Chocolate, obviously.

165
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:52,349
I also like cheeseburgers as a fruit.

166
00:23:57,229 --> 00:24:00,232
What about your brother?
Does he like ice cream?

167
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,402
How do you know I have a brother?

168
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,572
Teachers know everything.

169
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,492
So where is he?

170
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,078
At home.

171
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:14,413
With your mom?

172
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:19,751
If you knew everything,
then you would know my mom's dead.

173
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,046
I'm sorry to hear that.

174
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:28,260
But that's something we have in common.
My mom died too.

175
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:31,680
Really?

176
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,224
When I was 12.

177
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,351
I'm 12.

178
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:37,936
I know.

179
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,565
So tell me about your brother.
What's his name?

180
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:46,445
Aiden.

181
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,073
How old's Aiden?

182
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,118
Seven.

183
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:56,496
Oh, so he's... Is he in our school?

184
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,999
Not anymore.

185
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:05,839
He's always with my dad.

186
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,135
Does your dad teach him at home?

187
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,554
What's your dad do?

188
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:16,975
I gotta go.

189
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:23,148
And don't follow me this time.

190
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,068
Move!

191
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,236
Shoo.

192
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

193
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:21,827
Hello?

194
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,957
-What... What?
-Jesus! Jesus!

195
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,418
I thought you heard me.

196
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,961
No.

197
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:15,547
The fuck is this?

198
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:20,052
Is that the kind of thing
you taught in California?

199
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:25,849
'Cause I don't think that's gonna fly here.

200
00:29:32,523 --> 00:29:33,524
Paul.

201
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:42,324
You have every right to resent me.

202
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,332
I don't blame you for that.

203
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,294
I know you couldn't have understood then...

204
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,839
but I couldn't stay in this house anymore.

205
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:02,344
Just know that I have spent my life...

206
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:06,181
trying to deal with leaving you.

207
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:12,563
And resolve my issues.

208
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,440
And it has not been easy.

209
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,738
Yeah, and I've spent my entire life
praying you'd come back.

210
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

211
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:48,867
Go!

212
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:11,849
Here.

213
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:14,351
I got this for you.

214
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:28,115
I'll come back after he's eaten.
He'll be tired.

215
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:52,241
<i>Daddy, no.</i>

216
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:57,913
<i>No. Daddy.</i>

217
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,166
<i>Please. You're hurting me.</i>

218
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:04,962
Hey, Jules. What? What?

219
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:08,257
-Jesus!
-Sorry.

220
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:10,342
You okay?

221
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:13,846
-Jesus.
-Sorry.

222
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:16,223
I was just...

223
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:20,768
I wanted to clear the air and talk.

224
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,731
-You sure you're okay?
-Yeah.

225
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:30,946
Well, no. I'm...

226
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:34,324
So many...

227
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:44,585
Hey... do you know Frank Weaver?

228
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,085
Of course.

229
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:47,713
I've cited him...

230
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,759
and revived him with Narcan
more times than I can count.

231
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:54,219
Why?

232
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:57,222
His son is a student of mine.

233
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:00,017
That was his drawing.

234
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:02,394
I pulled it from the trash.

235
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:03,979
That makes sense, yeah.

236
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:05,480
Every time I see him...

237
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:09,109
I expect to find Frank dead
with a needle in his arm.

238
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:11,361
So why isn't he in jail?

239
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,114
I don't know. I've tried many times...

240
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:18,994
but he goes away,
who takes care of the boys?

241
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:20,954
After their mother died...

242
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:26,627
Protective Services felt he was somehow
fit enough to be their guardian.

243
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:30,631
And what can I say to that?

244
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,758
Something is going on there.

245
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:35,594
First of all,
it looks like no one even lives there.

246
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,971
And when I got close...

247
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:40,057
You went to his house?

248
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:44,561
I thought I heard something
that did not sound normal.

249
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,063
You can't do that.

250
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,898
You can't go to Frank Weaver's house...

251
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,608
-without telling me.
-I heard something, and it was not normal.

252
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:53,403
Do you understand? You can't do that.

253
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,072
Everyone thinks these problems
are just gonna go away...

254
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,990
and we know that they don't.

255
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:08,502
Lucas?

256
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:15,008
Lucas... I'm hungry.

257
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:19,007
-Where did you get this?
-His desk.

258
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:26,348
It's textbook, Ellen.

259
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:28,141
Emotional, physical...

260
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:29,560
Hold on.

261
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:33,897
Neither of us are experts
in diagnosing abuse, but I hear you.

262
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,401
This is very disturbing.

263
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,198
But sadly, Lucas is not the only one
not getting the attention he needs.

264
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:45,409
But he's here. In a safe space.

265
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:47,119
What is that supposed to mean?

266
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:49,580
His younger brother, why isn't he enrolled?

267
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:52,583
We've had plenty of students
that are homeschooled.

268
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:55,419
And they're kept out
so they can move product for their parents.

269
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:59,965
Or so we don't smell methamphetamine
on their clothes, and turn their parents in.

270
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:05,262
Okay, but regardless, that is a cry for help.

271
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:09,391
Take it from someone who can diagnose abuse.

272
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:24,281
I tell you what, next chance I get,
I will reach out to his father.

273
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:28,202
<i>Here you go.</i>

274
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,042
What can I do for ya?

275
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,381
Sorry.

276
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:43,926
Hey.

277
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:51,600
I don't know, Paul.
It was just...

278
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:54,102
The bottom half was all chewed to hell.

279
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,979
Damnedest thing I ever saw.

280
00:39:57,689 --> 00:39:59,274
All right, well...

281
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:02,611
We'll go take a look.
Thank you, Warren.

282
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,404
Thanks, Sheriff.

283
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:13,121
What's going on?

284
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:18,043
He found a part of a man
in the woods today.

285
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:20,963
Part of a man?

286
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:24,007
Who is that?

287
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:26,760
You don't remember Sheriff Stokes?

288
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:29,054
-When we were kids?
-Yeah, I do.

289
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:34,059
Yeah, he said he was
hiking up near Greymouth...

290
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:37,271
when a stench led him...

291
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:39,773
to a man half buried in the woods.

292
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:45,904
I guess the other half was found in the mine,
near a meth lab.

293
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:51,034
It was probably
a bear or a cougar, something.

294
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:52,494
Jesus.

295
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:54,371
Well, from what he just told me...

296
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:59,459
I don't think Jesus was anywhere to be found.

297
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:02,921
All right.
We gotta get out there and meet the coroner.

298
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,175
See you later.

299
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:09,636
Ready?

300
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:39,499
-Hi.
-Hi.

301
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,376
Are you okay?

302
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,257
Is God really dead?

303
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:48,509
What?

304
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:51,553
Daddy said God is dead.

305
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,732
Just remember what Mama told us.

306
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:09,154
Me and you...
we was born under the lucky star.

307
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:18,121
Here. I brought you these.

308
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:04,543
Determining cause was virtually impossible.

309
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:09,464
This has got to be an animal, right?

310
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:12,634
No animal that I've ever seen.

311
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:17,181
What's more troubling are the teeth marks...

312
00:43:17,347 --> 00:43:19,600
on the radial bone.

313
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,102
They seem human.

314
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:29,109
I don't quite know what to tell you, Paul.

315
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:32,070
I'm sorry.

316
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:40,908
<i>She false with Cassio!
Did you say with Cassio?</i>

317
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:42,910
<i>With Cassio, mistress.
Go to, charm your tongue.</i>

318
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:46,038
<i>I will not charm my tongue,
I am bound to speak.</i>

319
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:49,583
<i>My mistress here lies murdered in her bed.</i>

320
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,084
<i>Heavens forfend!</i>

321
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:58,091
<i>Nay, stare not, masters, it is true, indeed.</i>

322
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:02,513
<i>Nay, lay thee down and roar.</i>

323
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:06,308
<i>For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent
that e'er did lift up eye.</i>

324
00:46:06,475 --> 00:46:07,476
<i>Oh, she was foul!</i>

325
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:10,395
<i>Iago knows that she with Cassio
hath the act of shame...</i>

326
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:11,605
<i>a thousand times committed.</i>

327
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:12,648
<i>Oh, heavens!</i>

328
00:46:12,814 --> 00:46:14,066
<i>Cassio confessed it.</i>

329
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:16,902
<i>And she did gratify his amorous works
with that same handkerchief.</i>

330
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:18,445
<i>-Handkerchief.
-Alas!</i>

331
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:20,155
<i>'Twill out, 'twill out.</i>

332
00:46:20,322 --> 00:46:21,698
<i>-Hold your peace.
-I peace?</i>

333
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:24,868
<i>-No, I will speak as liberal as the north.
-Be wise.</i>

334
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:29,081
<i>Let heaven and men and devils...</i>

335
00:46:29,248 --> 00:46:31,083
<i>let them all, all, all...</i>

336
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:40,425
Hello?

337
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:52,271
Mr. Weaver, it's Ellen Booth, from school.

338
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:12,958
<i>Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil.</i>

339
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:16,461
<i>Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?</i>

340
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:19,173
<i>Demand me nothing.</i>

341
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:21,717
<i>What you know, you know.</i>

342
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:26,597
<i>Are there no stones in heaven...</i>

343
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:29,099
<i>but what serve for the thunder?</i>

344
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:15,354
Mr. Weaver!

345
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:09,283
Hello?

346
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,513
Oh, my God.

347
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:34,725
You must be starving.

348
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:37,394
What has he done to you?

349
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:24,626
<i>Here's where we found
the other half of Kenny Glass, right here.</i>

350
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:28,338
What are these?

351
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:32,050
Medicine bags. Wards, for defense.

352
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:35,721
But why would these be hanging in here?

353
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:50,903
What about this?

354
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:56,158
Is that from a buck?

355
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:57,576
Nope.

356
00:51:57,743 --> 00:52:00,537
Nothing like anything I've seen before.

357
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:03,999
How far back does this go?

358
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:06,919
Far. But I wouldn't go any further.

359
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:11,048
Go for Paul.

360
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:16,595
Say again.

361
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:22,392
10-9.

362
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,605
<i>...missing person.</i>

363
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:27,773
Shit.

364
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:31,276
All right. Let's go.

365
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:11,900
Headed to your house
full of drugged-out freaks?

366
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:16,446
Teacher can't step in
to save your ass out here, faggot.

367
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:17,865
I said I was sorry.

368
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:19,658
I don't take apologies from pussies.

369
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:24,538
Hey! Don't walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

370
00:53:36,758 --> 00:53:37,593
Lucas!

371
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:56,046
<i>When was the last time
you heard from Ellen?</i>

372
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:57,548
Ellen Booth?

373
00:54:59,216 --> 00:55:01,969
Yesterday. Why?

374
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:05,931
<i>Her husband called in
a missing person's report.</i>

375
00:55:06,098 --> 00:55:08,725
<i>Said she hadn't returned his calls...</i>

376
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:10,811
<i>or been home all day.</i>

377
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:11,812
<i>Really?</i>

378
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:15,941
What are you doing about it?

379
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:17,526
<i>Filed a report.</i>

380
00:55:17,693 --> 00:55:20,070
<i>Issued an APB, searched the hospitals...</i>

381
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:25,409
<i>but aside from that,
just hope it's all a misunderstanding.</i>

382
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:32,374
I asked her to talk to Frank Weaver.
About Lucas.

383
00:55:40,757 --> 00:55:42,176
You smell that?

384
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:43,302
Yeah.

385
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,770
Frank, it's Sheriff Meadows.

386
00:55:57,733 --> 00:55:59,985
Fucking place smells like death.

387
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:04,448
Yeah, there's something wrong here.

388
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,704
Frank!

389
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,545
Let's get outta here.
We'll get a warrant tomorrow.

390
00:56:43,612 --> 00:56:45,781
<i>...small town of Cispus Falls, Oregon.</i>

391
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:48,158
<i>Rumors of another round
of gruesome attacks...</i>

392
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:52,246
<i>...processing evidence
and provide forensic expertise.</i>

393
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:55,332
<i>Our attempts to contact
local law enforcement have gone unanswered...</i>

394
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,876
Have you spoken with Clint's parents
this morning?

395
00:56:58,669 --> 00:57:02,464
Yes. They wanted to know
if he had been in school yesterday.

396
00:57:02,631 --> 00:57:05,008
And he was here
till the end of the day, right?

397
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:12,558
Look, I know this has...

398
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:16,478
been difficult on all of us.

399
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:20,315
But right now, we have to work
under the assumption...

400
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:24,194
that this is just some kind of a coincidence.

401
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:25,571
We'll find him.

402
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:27,823
We'll find him.

403
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:34,413
Excuse me.

404
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:39,710
-What?
-A coincidence?

405
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,172
That my student is now missing, too?
What the fuck, Paul?

406
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:45,757
What else would you like me to do, Jules?

407
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:50,262
The warrant is being processed right now.
It takes time.

408
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:51,471
-It doesn't just happen overnight.
-This is all related.

409
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:54,099
-What would you like me to fucking do?
-You cannot tell me that it isn't.

410
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:50,822
God almighty.

411
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:04,378
These Frank Weaver's footprints?

412
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:05,879
Some.

413
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,841
There's also a child's.

414
00:59:21,228 --> 00:59:23,146
What the fuck is this?

415
00:59:26,608 --> 00:59:27,776
Jesus Christ.

416
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:31,613
It's charred.

417
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:34,449
It's burnt.

418
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:36,618
And flayed.

419
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:40,205
It's gotta be Frank Weaver.

420
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:44,209
Yeah, the teeth will tell us.

421
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:47,045
Looks like something just burst out of him.

422
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,891
Lucas. Lucas, listen to me.
Listen, I don't want you to go in there.

423
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:01,935
-No. No. Let me go!
-Listen, I know. It's okay.

424
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:03,312
What's going on here?

425
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:28,003
Well, needless to say, I'm concerned.

426
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,923
He's severely dehydrated,
suffers from chronic malnourishment.

427
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:34,301
I recommend keeping him overnight,
possibly longer...

428
01:00:34,468 --> 01:00:38,222
but I don't have to tell you
that he is a deeply damaged boy.

429
01:00:38,388 --> 01:00:41,475
Could be the circumstances
or his genetic disposition...

430
01:00:41,642 --> 01:00:45,771
but there are definite signs
of a psychiatric crisis here.

431
01:00:45,938 --> 01:00:49,149
Anti-anxiety, anti-psychotics
will be our friend...

432
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:51,777
but given what he's just experienced...

433
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:54,738
When do you think
I'll be able to interview him?

434
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:57,241
Well, not tonight, certainly.

435
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:00,869
What do you plan on doing with him?

436
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:02,996
Well, we're discussing that.

437
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:07,167
But it's complicated.

438
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:08,961
Oh, I'm sure.

439
01:01:09,419 --> 01:01:12,089
The little fella's
got a long road ahead of him.

440
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:14,925
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention...

441
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:19,388
but it's clear that he has been
subjected to abuse.

442
01:01:20,222 --> 01:01:21,932
And for some time.

443
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:24,977
Thank you, Alan.

444
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:36,196
We can't. No.

445
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:37,948
He has no one.

446
01:01:39,908 --> 01:01:41,493
We don't know where the brother is.

447
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:44,663
So where's he gonna go?

448
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:48,250
I have no idea right now,
but he is not your responsibility.

449
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:50,460
He doesn't have a family.

450
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:54,089
And he's my student.
So he is my responsibility.

451
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:55,883
Jules...

452
01:01:57,134 --> 01:01:59,428
This is not about you.

453
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:01,763
This is about him,
and getting him the help...

454
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,640
What did you just say to me?

455
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:06,185
What did you just say to me?

456
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:12,274
Don't put our past on him.

457
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:14,318
Oh, I'm sorry.

458
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:16,695
Did he snap your arm in two?

459
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:20,407
Did he force you
to hide under the floor of that kitchen...

460
01:02:20,574 --> 01:02:22,451
-praying he would never come home?
-You have no idea what he...

461
01:02:22,618 --> 01:02:24,244
Did you have to meet
his every fucking need?

462
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:26,330
Because I don't remember that.

463
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:31,293
You have no idea what he did to me.

464
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:08,705
Let us in!

465
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:10,123
<i>Daddy!</i>

466
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:11,875
Daddy!

467
01:03:12,835 --> 01:03:14,545
-Dad, please!
-Open the door, Daddy!

468
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:18,423
Guys, you have to give me a second.

469
01:03:18,757 --> 01:03:20,217
Daddy's just sick.

470
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:25,973
Daddy! Daddy, please!

471
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,434
Daddy, what's happening to you?

472
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:31,395
-Open the door!
-No!

473
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:33,272
Daddy!

474
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:44,324
Look at me. Daddy is very, very sick.

475
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,827
You lock that fucking door.

476
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:49,580
No matter what I do,
you don't open that door.

477
01:03:49,746 --> 01:03:51,039
You hear me?

478
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:55,043
Lock it!

479
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:56,545
<i>Lock the door!</i>

480
01:03:56,712 --> 01:03:59,131
<i>Daddy, Aiden's very sick.</i>

481
01:04:41,757 --> 01:04:44,927
If you wouldn't mind, just telling me
what you make of these.

482
01:05:01,735 --> 01:05:03,153
Where did you find this?

483
01:05:03,904 --> 01:05:05,781
Belongs to a student.

484
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:09,535
Is the student Native?

485
01:05:10,494 --> 01:05:11,745
No.

486
01:05:11,912 --> 01:05:13,455
How can that be?

487
01:05:13,622 --> 01:05:16,375
I don't know. He isn't.

488
01:05:25,801 --> 01:05:27,636
This is what was in the mine.

489
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,520
This... is what was in the mine.

490
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:41,775
It's the wendigo.

491
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:43,861
Translates to...

492
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:48,282
a diabolical wickedness that devours mankind.

493
01:05:48,448 --> 01:05:51,118
According to legend,
during a brutally cold winter...

494
01:05:51,285 --> 01:05:54,496
a lost hunter's severe hunger
drove him to cannibalism.

495
01:05:55,122 --> 01:05:56,999
And after feasting on human flesh...

496
01:05:57,165 --> 01:05:59,626
he became crazed...

497
01:06:01,128 --> 01:06:05,966
and transformed into an amorphous spirit
that could take many forms.

498
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:10,095
And roamed the forest for fresh victims.

499
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:13,640
His insatiable appetite was never satisfied.

500
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:19,271
Excuse me.
This is a myth you're talking about.

501
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,106
For you, yeah.

502
01:06:21,732 --> 01:06:25,652
But a cautionary tale
to the indigenous people who believe in it.

503
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:29,072
They're elusive.

504
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:33,535
And known to be eternally starving,
but feasting only makes them hungrier.

505
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:34,995
And weaker.

506
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:37,664
Those who are unfortunate enough
to encounter one...

507
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:42,169
can only kill it
when it's in its weakened state.

508
01:06:42,711 --> 01:06:46,673
And only by extinguishing
its beating heart...

509
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,385
forcing it to search for another host.

510
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:53,472
But it all makes sense, you see.

511
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:56,350
I mean, our ancestral spirits never died.

512
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:58,393
They were here long before we were...

513
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,230
and they'll be here
long after we are gone.

514
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,150
But now, they're angry.

515
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:19,957
<i>Paul.</i>

516
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:22,751
Go for Paul.

517
01:07:24,378 --> 01:07:26,588
<i>Pumphouse Road.
You gotta come by the tracks.</i>

518
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,386
What? What happened?

519
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:34,680
<i>We got a body out here.</i>

520
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:39,393
<i>It's bad, Paul. It's real bad.</i>

521
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:57,244
ID?

522
01:07:57,411 --> 01:07:59,204
Yeah. It's Clint Owens.

523
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:04,877
I don't know where to start, Paul.

524
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:07,713
Let me see it.

525
01:08:14,052 --> 01:08:16,095
Tell me this was a train, Jake.

526
01:08:19,183 --> 01:08:21,435
<i>That boy was eaten in half.</i>

527
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:22,769
The fuck is going on here?

528
01:08:22,978 --> 01:08:25,147
I don't know, Dan.

529
01:08:26,648 --> 01:08:27,858
We've...

530
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:32,237
Let's get back to the station...

531
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:36,325
and we'll figure it out.
I'll call the mayor...

532
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:39,161
and we'll get out in front of it.

533
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:49,921
I'm sorry.
I'm not inclined to believe anybody...

534
01:08:50,087 --> 01:08:55,219
about some mythological nature beast.

535
01:08:55,676 --> 01:08:58,305
Things like that don't exist, Jules.

536
01:08:58,471 --> 01:09:00,098
Regardless of what Stokes said.

537
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:05,103
There's a logical, reasonable explanation
for this.

538
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:08,106
So Ellen Booth...

539
01:09:09,274 --> 01:09:13,946
and that... husk that you pulled out
of the Weavers'.

540
01:09:16,907 --> 01:09:19,117
And what about Lucas's brother, where is he?

541
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,665
I don't know.

542
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:29,336
Take me to the hospital.

543
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:17,301
I'm outside your house.

544
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,513
<i>Good. I'm wrapping up with the mayor,
then headed over.</i>

545
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,098
<i>Just take a look around.</i>

546
01:10:46,538 --> 01:10:48,498
Can I get you anything else?

547
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:51,001
No, thank you.

548
01:11:03,388 --> 01:11:08,602
<i>Lucas, do you remember
when we were talking about our moms?</i>

549
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:11,104
And how they died?

550
01:11:14,066 --> 01:11:16,860
Well, what I didn't tell you...

551
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:20,322
was that my dad died, too.

552
01:11:24,076 --> 01:11:25,702
How did he die?

553
01:11:28,372 --> 01:11:31,667
Well, he kind of did it to himself.

554
01:11:32,543 --> 01:11:34,670
When did he die?

555
01:11:35,212 --> 01:11:37,339
Not too long ago.

556
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:39,633
Were you here when he died?

557
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:41,718
No.

558
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:44,930
Why?

559
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:48,475
Didn't you love your father?

560
01:11:54,147 --> 01:11:58,986
Well, I moved back here
to be with my brother.

561
01:12:00,237 --> 01:12:02,573
We actually, we grew up in this house.

562
01:12:04,283 --> 01:12:05,742
And I missed him.

563
01:12:27,598 --> 01:12:31,935
Lucas, did they tell you at the hospital?

564
01:12:33,562 --> 01:12:35,480
Tell me what?

565
01:12:38,192 --> 01:12:40,569
Your dad died.

566
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,741
He's not dead.

567
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:48,577
Yeah, he is, Lucas.

568
01:12:50,662 --> 01:12:52,331
My brother, Paul...

569
01:12:53,248 --> 01:12:55,209
he found him in your house.

570
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:59,546
No. That was my old dad.

571
01:13:00,172 --> 01:13:02,549
The one who was sick and mean.

572
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:07,804
My new dad is with Aiden,
but Aiden doesn't understand.

573
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:09,640
And he needs me.

574
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:13,060
I just have to feed him,
and he'll love me.

575
01:13:15,812 --> 01:13:16,897
What?

576
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:47,219
See? I told you.

577
01:13:51,807 --> 01:13:55,894
He'll come for me,
and take me to the mine to be with Aiden.

578
01:14:05,654 --> 01:14:07,447
He's here.

579
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:18,208
Hey, Paul?

580
01:14:21,378 --> 01:14:22,963
Yeah, Dan, what is it?

581
01:14:24,631 --> 01:14:25,966
<i>There's something here.</i>

582
01:14:27,676 --> 01:14:29,678
I think it's in the shed.

583
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:51,658
Come on. Let's go.

584
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:04,546
Where are you taking me?

585
01:15:15,265 --> 01:15:16,808
I wanna see my brother.

586
01:15:49,216 --> 01:15:50,133
<i>Dan?</i>

587
01:15:55,138 --> 01:15:56,723
<i>Dan, do you read me?</i>

588
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
There's a little kid in here.
<i>What, Lucas?</i>

589
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:11,864
<i>Lucas is at the house.</i>

590
01:16:15,325 --> 01:16:15,993
<i>Dan!</i>

591
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:19,913
Dan, come in!

592
01:16:26,295 --> 01:16:27,296
Oh, shit.

593
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:29,423
They all have locks.

594
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:56,200
Goddamn it.

595
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:59,411
Fuck.

596
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:02,998
Paul.

597
01:17:08,879 --> 01:17:11,965
Lucas, stay. Don't move.

598
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:33,695
Paul, no.

599
01:17:36,532 --> 01:17:37,824
No. Lucas!

600
01:18:10,607 --> 01:18:11,608
Dan.

601
01:18:15,946 --> 01:18:16,947
It's okay.

602
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

603
01:19:56,129 --> 01:19:57,130
Paul?

604
01:19:58,131 --> 01:19:59,132
Paul?

605
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:11,895
Lucas?

606
01:20:37,671 --> 01:20:38,672
Paul?

607
01:20:41,925 --> 01:20:43,010
Oh, my God!

608
01:20:44,469 --> 01:20:47,222
Paul! Oh, my God. Paul!

609
01:20:50,017 --> 01:20:51,310
Oh, God.

610
01:21:07,284 --> 01:21:08,285
Paul...

611
01:21:09,786 --> 01:21:13,248
Paul, I have to move you. Paul.

612
01:21:17,377 --> 01:21:18,670
I'm gonna move you.

613
01:21:18,837 --> 01:21:19,838
To where?

614
01:21:21,798 --> 01:21:22,799
Come on.

615
01:21:25,344 --> 01:21:26,678
Is Lucas dead?

616
01:21:26,845 --> 01:21:28,514
Be still. Be still.

617
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:32,267
He went to the mine.
I'm gonna go after him.

618
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:33,435
What?

619
01:21:33,602 --> 01:21:34,978
He thinks that's where Aiden is.

620
01:21:35,145 --> 01:21:37,564
No, you can't do that.
You can't...

621
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:39,900
I have to. I have to go find him.

622
01:21:40,067 --> 01:21:41,443
Not by yourself.

623
01:21:42,778 --> 01:21:44,238
You need a doctor.

624
01:21:44,404 --> 01:21:45,864
I'm coming with you.

625
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:48,283
Get my gun.

626
01:21:50,869 --> 01:21:52,955
You're not leaving me.

627
01:22:17,563 --> 01:22:19,106
This is Julia Meadows.

628
01:22:19,773 --> 01:22:21,817
Paul and I are at Greymouth Mine.

629
01:22:22,192 --> 01:22:23,694
He needs an ambulance.

630
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:08,280
Lucas?

631
01:23:48,362 --> 01:23:49,363
Lucas?

632
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:29,796
Lucas?

633
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:31,298
Lucas.

634
01:25:32,633 --> 01:25:33,634
He's...

635
01:25:36,762 --> 01:25:37,930
What?

636
01:25:38,096 --> 01:25:39,348
Go back.

637
01:25:39,515 --> 01:25:40,516
Go.

638
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:37,020
He's gonna be okay.

639
01:30:37,187 --> 01:30:38,647
He's just sick.

640
01:30:42,609 --> 01:30:44,027
Lucas, listen to me.

641
01:30:46,154 --> 01:30:48,782
He is never gonna get better.

642
01:30:49,533 --> 01:30:50,742
Yes, he is.

643
01:30:50,909 --> 01:30:52,703
Lucas, he's not.

644
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:54,663
It's too late for him.

645
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:55,747
He's sick...

646
01:30:56,498 --> 01:30:58,584
but he'll be better, I promise.

647
01:31:02,713 --> 01:31:04,298
Lucas, listen to me.

648
01:31:04,464 --> 01:31:06,925
You know he's not gonna get any better.

649
01:31:08,051 --> 01:31:10,387
I need to know that you understand.

650
01:31:24,985 --> 01:31:28,447
Look away. Look away, Lucas!

651
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:31,325
It's okay.

652
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:50,219
I'm so sorry.

653
01:32:45,357 --> 01:32:47,234
What are we gonna do with him?

654
01:32:49,862 --> 01:32:52,197
Keep him. For now.

655
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:55,742
We have no choice.

656
01:32:59,079 --> 01:33:01,623
It's like living with a tiger cub.

657
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:06,086
You know what he's going to grow into.

658
01:33:10,799 --> 01:33:14,011
Do you think you could kill
something you love?

659
01:33:31,445 --> 01:33:32,196
There.

660
01:33:33,071 --> 01:33:34,239
Come on, let's go.

661
01:33:37,743 --> 01:33:40,454
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'll catch up to you.
