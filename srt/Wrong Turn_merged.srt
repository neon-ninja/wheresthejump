00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,360
Which means I make coffee for a living.

176
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,778
[laughs]

177
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,363
But right now I'm looking at you,

178
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,989
and I'm seeing some
yellowing in your eyes.

179
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,242
Which means what, Milla? Hmm?

180
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,411
Oh, um, it could be liver problems.

181
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,623
Jaundice, hepatitis, Gilbert syndrome.

182
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,334
You should probably
see a doctor, actually.

183
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,382
All right, well...

184
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,801
you kids be safe.

185
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,513
Maybe we'll see you again.

186
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,312
- [sighs]
- Seriously, do not do that ever again.

187
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,356
- I can't handle that.
- Dude, why do we let you drink?

188
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,691
Because usually I'm very funny.

189
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,193
No, actually, you have never,
ever been funny.

190
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,486
Like, never.

191
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,946
Where are the drinks?

192
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,282
[rock song playing]

193
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,742
[Milla]
You know this song.

194
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,619
[Adam]
Do you know this?

195
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,663
No, but it's a good song.

196
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,889
Okay, people, 8:00 a.m.

197
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,016
Luis, Gary, I'm talking to you.

198
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,767
Okay, I'm not a morning person.

199
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,853
If I don't get my eight hours,
I will be a zombie.

200
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,771
- [Milla] Be a zombie who hikes.
- [Darius] Hey, guys.

201
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,024
- Guys.
- [Milla] What?

202
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,610
[Darius] Who's that by the car?

203
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,820
Is that one of those assholes
from the bar?

204
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,780
[Darius]
Yeah, probably.

205
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,824
- Hey.
- [Darius] Adam.

206
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,868
- Relax.
- [Adam] Hey!

207
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,953
Get away from the car, man.

208
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,123
Get away from there. Shoo.

209
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,125
- He's not a dog.
- Yo!

210
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,462
Are you deaf or something?
Back the fuck off!

211
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:38,175
Jesus, Adam, are you trying
to piss off everyone in Middle America?

212
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,927
You gotta be tough with these people.

213
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,428
[Milla]
Okay, big guy, time for bed.

214
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,763
- Come on.
- Back me up here.

215
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,473
Adam.

216
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,058
[whispering]
Come on, forget about it.

217
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,768
[Adam]
Where the hell did that guy go?

218
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,519
- [phone line ringing]
- [Milla] Come on.

219
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,229
[Scott, on voicemail]
<i>Hi. This is Scott.</i>

220
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,231
<i>Leave a message and I'll get
right back to you. Thank you.</i>

221
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,193
- [voicemail beeps]
- [Jen] <i>Hey, Dad. Sorry to call so late.</i>

222
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,195
We're still hiking the Appalachian Trail.

223
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,197
When I get back,
I promise I'll give you an answer

224
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,865
about what I plan to do.

225
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,203
I love you.

226
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,579
Say hi to Corinne.

227
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,498
Maybe she'll say hi back for a change.

228
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,376
Okay, talk soon.

229
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,170
Bye.

230
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,173
[Milla]
<i>So is Adam right?</i>

231
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,716
<i>Are you on edge?</i>

232
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,052
We can go home right now.

233
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,722
Hey, nice try,
but you don't have to protect me.

234
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,107
You know why I work in nonprofit
instead of on Wall Street?

235
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,820
Because...

236
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,908
I want to build a community
where people are valued

237
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:48,745
on their skills and their character.

238
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:55,877
Not their bank account
or their skin color.

239
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,047
Everyone works.

240
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,300
Everyone shares.

241
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:07,097
I'd give anything for that.

242
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,599
I know.

243
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,021
That's why I love you.

244
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,695
These are beautiful.
Did you make all this?

245
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,031
Some.

246
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,493
Hey.

247
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,162
I'm Jen. What's your name?

248
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,875
- [laughs]
- Don't mind Ruthie.

249
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,293
She don't like to talk.

250
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,212
I was shy too at her age.

251
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,131
- Is she yours?
- In a manner.

252
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,134
It takes a village to raise a child,
isn't that what they say?

253
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:27,969
How much?

254
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,346
Ten dollars.

255
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,181
[zipper opens]

256
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,354
[Jen laughs]

257
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,980
Thanks.

258
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,110
[Milla] Good morning.

259
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,028
I've literally never seen you wear this.

260
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,988
- Wow. Wow.
- Okay.

261
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,448
[indistinct chattering]

262
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,325
[all]
Yeah!

263
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,576
[applause]

264
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,829
[Adam]
Walk of shame.

265
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,048
[Milla] Hey, what's up, you guys?
Me and Gary are going on a hike.

266
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,925
[Gary]
I didn't know that you were filming.

267
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,344
[Milla] Everyone's here.
Yeah, it's for a YouTube video.

268
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,276
[Milla]
Catch me.

269
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,903
[all laughing]

270
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,072
Oh, my God! Help!

271
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,574
[indistinct chatter]

272
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,035
[Milla]
Oh, it's beautiful. Nature.

273
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,121
[Adam]
Is anyone still drunk from last night?

274
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,123
- [all laughing]
- [Gary] Bitch, I am.

275
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,708
That last shot was a bad idea.

276
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,335
[Jen] Wait, looks like the trail ends.

277
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,172
[Milla] Are we going this way,
or are we going this way?

278
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,132
[Luis]
Do you have signal on your phone?

279
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,717
[Milla]
No.

280
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,594
[all laughing]

281
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,888
- [Jen] I can do that.
- [Darius] I've been horrible.

282
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,308
- [Adam] Look at that.
- This is fucking awesome!

283
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,976
[all laughing]

284
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,811
Whoo!

285
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,029
It's up here.

286
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,160
Okay?

287
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,014
[no audio]

288
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,194
[Milla] Do you know where we're going?

289
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,153
[Adam] I don't.

290
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,821
[Milla] Do you know where we're going?

291
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,448
[indistinct chattering]

292
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,536
Okay, quick little side trip, guys.

293
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,163
- [Jen] What?
- There's supposed to be

294
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,749
a very well-preserved
Civil War fort near here.

295
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,960
Cool. Let's find it.

296
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,587
Um, the woman at the inn
said we shouldn't leave the trail.

297
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,547
It's just a quick look around.

298
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:13,051
Babe, if we don't find anything,
we'll just cut back over to the trail.

299
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:16,638
You know what we wouldn't have found
if we would have stayed on the trail?

300
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,932
Hmm? The waterfall.

301
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,476
And that cliff, hmm?

302
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,062
[laughs]
Come on. We'll be good.

303
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,358
- Okay.
- Okay?

304
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,027
- [laughs]
- She said yes!

305
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,363
- [Jen] Whoo! Whoo!
- [Gary] Let's do it.

306
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,739
[Adam] What does that mean?
They getting married?

307
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,241
[Milla] Wait, just for the hike, right?

308
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,040
[Jen] You good?

309
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,419
[Gary] Such a hiker.

310
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,342
[Milla] What was that?

311
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,136
- [Adam] A snake.
- [Milla] Oh, my God.

312
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,180
[Milla gasps]

313
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,601
- [Adam] You okay?
- Yeah.

314
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,563
[Gary] We're good.

315
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,898
- [Jen] Shit. Yeah, thanks.
- Fuck.

316
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,198
[camera clicks]

317
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,578
- Ah!
- [all scream]

318
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,542
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

319
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,545
Dar, how much longer
is this gonna take?

320
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,506
Look, it's just a little further, okay?
I promise, okay?

321
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,674
Please.

322
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,301
- You okay?
- No!

323
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,264
[Darius] We got to go.
We got to keep going.

324
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,683
[Adam] We've been walking
for fucking hours.

325
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:44,642
That's what we've been doing.

326
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,478
[Milla] We've been walking
way more than an hour.

327
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,646
What are you talking about?
It's been like four hours.

328
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,231
- [Gary] Four hours?
- [Adam] No, I mean...

329
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,025
I mean, since we passed that thing.

330
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,651
You know what?

331
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:57,530
Why don't you guys
just, um, just head back to the trail.

332
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,990
I'll meet you guys up there.

333
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,242
[wood cracking distantly]

334
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,244
What is that?

335
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,045
- [gasps]
- Oh, my God! Adam!

336
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,755
- Oh, my God!
- Go, go, go, go, go.

337
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,715
[log rumbling]

338
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,302
[Darius] You guys, move left!

345
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,381
Adam?

346
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,051
Milla. Hey.

347
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,846
[grunts]

348
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,306
You left me.

349
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,310
- What?
- You left me.

350
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,062
I know. I know. I'm sorry, okay?

351
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,106
I was freaking out.
I didn't know what I was doing.

352
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,774
- You left me!
- I know. I'm sorry.

353
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,901
[sobbing]
You left me!

354
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,736
Please, don't do that again!

355
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,738
- [panting]
- [Adam] I'm so sorry, okay?

356
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,490
Come here.

357
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,742
Oh, fuck.

358
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,453
Jen? Jen?

359
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,039
Jen! Jen!

360
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:31,833
Are you okay?

361
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,878
[panting]

362
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,254
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

363
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,881
Oh, my God, Darius! Your finger!

364
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,382
Oh, fuck!

365
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,633
[hyperventilating]

366
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,094
We're okay. Oh, fuck.

367
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,597
Where's Luis and Gary?

368
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,015
Huh?

369
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,942
[shrieks]

370
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,111
[Adam] Oh, shit.

371
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,827
Luis. Luis, man. Get out of here.

372
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,245
Come on. Let's go over here. Come on.

373
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,622
No, no, no, no.

374
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,540
- No, no! No!
- Let's go over here.

375
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,751
Do not fucking touch me!

376
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,213
Okay.

377
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,256
[sobbing]

378
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,841
No, no, no.

379
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,303
Oh, fucking shit.

380
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,971
[crying]

381
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,890
We need to call for help.

382
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,850
I can't... I can't find my phone.

383
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:33,019
I can't find my phone. Help me find it.

384
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,772
Oh, fuck. No service.

385
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,649
We need to go to higher ground.

386
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,609
I'm going to climb up
and try and make a call.

387
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,070
There's no way we're going to go
back up there, okay?

388
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,989
- I'll find a way around.
- What fucking way around?

389
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:48,117
- Not by yourself.
- Jen... this is my fault.

390
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,453
It goddamn is.
It is your goddamn fault!

391
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,996
[all shouting]

392
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,915
[Adam]
Luis! Hey! Hey!

393
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,167
It's nobody's fault, okay?
Did Darius make the tree fall?

394
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,419
Look at me.
Did Darius make the tree fall? No.

395
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:02,382
This is fucking awful, okay?
But it's nobody's fault, okay?

396
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,925
[Luis sobbing]

397
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:08,221
Luis, I'm sorry, man!
I'm fucking sorry, man!

398
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,182
I'll go by myself. I'll go right now.

399
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,809
We all have to go.

400
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,019
- [Darius] Why?
- [sobs] I can't leave him.

401
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,729
[thunder rumbles]

402
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:21,192
If it rains,
which it looks like it's about to...

403
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,029
we're exposed out here, guys.

404
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,783
This slope's not safe.

405
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,831
I think... I think someone's up there.

406
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,292
- [Darius] What?
- [Jen] Someone's up there.

407
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,297
- [Darius] I don't... I don't see anyone.
- [Jen] Where are they?

408
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:49,554
I saw someone. I did.
I-I saw someone.

409
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:50,972
This is so fucked up.

410
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,473
[Jen] I saw someone.

411
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,058
It's okay.

412
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:58,438
Fuck this. Fuck this!

413
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,782
- [bone cracks]
- [whimpers]

414
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,868
You okay?

415
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,624
[clears throat]

416
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,167
Thanks.

417
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,377
No problem.

418
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,766
He won't be here long.

419
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,138
[Luis] No one's gonna admit it.

420
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,225
So I will.

421
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,644
We're lost!

422
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,063
Just admit it, Darius.

423
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,526
- No fucking clue where we are.
- Hey. Hey. We're fine.

424
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,361
We're-we're cutting across the mountain,

425
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,947
and eventually,
we'll hit the AT on the other side.

426
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,491
But I think that we can probably
camp out for the night.

427
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,285
I'm not leaving Gary
out there in the woods overnight

428
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,497
for animals and insects
and whatever the fuck!

429
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,332
That's not Gary anymore.

430
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,210
Luis, that was his body.

431
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,337
His spirit's moved on.

432
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,298
That's what he believed, right?

433
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:53,136
He's in paradise now. He's happy.

434
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,642
- Come here, man.
- [Luis sobs]

435
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:09,944
Okay?

436
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,530
Okay.

437
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,449
[thunder rumbles]

438
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,126
Can you pull this?

439
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,559
[rain pattering]

440
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,954
[thunder crashes]

441
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,062
[birds tweeting]

442
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,693
Oh, fuck.

443
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,657
Thank God it stopped raining.

444
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,784
Where's Milla?

445
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,743
Hmm?

446
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,163
I-1 didn't feel her get up.

447
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,166
She probably went somewhere to pee.

448
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:48,501
Milla?

449
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,794
[thump]

450
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:57,844
Jesus.

451
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:02,849
We've been sleeping in a graveyard.

452
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,184
[Darius] Hey, guys, come check this out.

453
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,562
What?

454
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,021
Look at this.

455
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:12,900
This is a declaration pledge
to the foundation of America.

456
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:16,195
[scoffs] You mean the Confederacy.

457
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,155
Long live slavery.

458
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:23,703
Uh, no, actually, this is...
dated before the war.

459
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,163
"November 24, 1859."

460
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,749
There's like a dozen families listed here,

461
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,295
pledging their lives
and their-their children's lives.

462
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:35,256
Hey, did one of you take my phone?

463
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,884
Um... no.

464
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:40,386
Maybe you dropped it yesterday
when everything was happening.

465
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:44,390
[Luis] No, no, I-I put it back
in my pack last night.

466
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,313
[Jen] Mine's not here either.

467
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:55,109
- Did Milla come back?
- [Luis] No.

468
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,153
- Hey, do you have your phone?
- What?

469
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,155
[patting pants]

470
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,411
Shit.

471
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,413
Where's our fucking phones?

472
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,040
[Luis] Okay, all our phones are gone.

473
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,917
What the fuck is going on?

474
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,544
I thought I saw somebody
outside the tent last night.

475
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,087
- [Darius] What?
- What?

476
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,173
- When?
- [Jen] In the middle of the night.

477
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,841
Just for a second.

478
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,635
Could have just been
shadows from the trees.

479
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,553
Fuck!

480
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,555
You guys, help me... Help me find Milla.

481
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,599
- Adam...
- [Jen] I'm sure she's fine.

482
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,143
You thought you saw someone
after the tree fell,

483
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:32,313
and then again last night,
and now our fucking phones are gone.

484
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:35,024
They're probably fucking
watching us right now!

485
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,486
No, no, no, no, I promised her
that I wouldn't fucking leave her again.

486
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:39,946
I fucking promised her that.

487
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,447
Hey, Adam! Adam!

488
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,366
[Adam] Milla!

489
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:47,078
Milla!

490
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,330
- [Jen] Milla!
- [Darius] Milla!

491
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,957
Milla!

492
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,709
Milla?

493
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,920
- [Luis] Milla!
- [Adam] Milla!

494
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,756
Milla!

495
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,258
Milla!

496
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:02,510
Hey.

497
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,553
[Luis] Milla!

498
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,516
- What are you doing out here?
- [Adam] Milla!

499
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:11,811
Who's that?

500
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,647
I saw her in town.

501
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,357
I think her name's Ruthie.

502
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,150
In town?

503
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,443
Hey!

504
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,654
Hey. Sorry.

505
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,572
Come here.
Why don't you come here for a second.

506
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,074
- Adam.
- [Adam] I just wanna ask you something.

507
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,869
No, you see this girl, and now she's here
out of fucking nowhere, and Milla's gone?

508
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,329
You think that this is a coincidence?

509
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,164
- No fucking way.
- Calm down.

510
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,250
I fucking warned you
about these white-trash hillbillies.

511
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,002
- Hey!
- Adam! Stop!

512
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,378
[Adam] Get over here!

513
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,046
Hey! Hey!

514
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,923
- [Jen] Adam!
- Hey!

515
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,758
Stop. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

516
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,095
[grunts]

517
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,221
[Jen]
Adam.

518
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:51,559
[Adam groaning]

519
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,185
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't let her get away!

520
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:55,521
- Dar, go on after her!
- [Jen] No, wait!

521
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,815
What?

522
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:00,109
Guys? Guys, what is that?

523
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,486
My foot's caught on something.

524
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,738
What the hell is that?

525
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,865
Guys! Whoa!

526
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,366
What the hell is this?

527
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,036
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Darius!

528
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,830
- What's going on? Guys?
- [Jen] Darius, help!

529
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,081
What? What?

530
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:16,417
[Adam screaming]

531
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,838
[Jen] Adam! Oh, my God!

532
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
[screaming]
No, no, no, no, no, no!
[Darius] Adam?
Can you hear me?
- Adam!
- Do you see him?

533
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:30,890
[breathing heavily] No.

534
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,100
Uh, I-I feel a draft.

535
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,643
Luis, grab my legs.

536
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,145
Lower me in, okay?

537
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,897
[grunts]
[pants]

538
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,398
Adam!

539
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,067
Adam...

540
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,779
Adam.

541
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,032
Oh, fuck! Shit! Shit!

542
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,533
[hissing]

543
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:52,203
Darius, this is crazy. We need help.

544
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,871
Look, if I can get that snake
out of there,

545
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,581
- maybe I can reach Adam, okay.
- [Jen] And do what?

546
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,709
He's still caught on that chain.
What if he's hurt?

547
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:01,420
Maybe this hole connects
to an old mine or something.

548
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,963
We can look for an entrance, and then...

549
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,425
Okay, how long do you want to look?
An hour? Two? All day?

550
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,760
That chain goes somewhere!

551
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,638
I know! Somebody put it there.

552
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,389
Do you hear what I'm saying?

553
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:15,518
We need to get the fuck
off this mountain and get help.

554
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,603
No phones. No GPS.

555
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,523
How are we supposed to find
our way back here, huh?

556
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,691
Jen, what the hell are you doing?

557
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,572
Let's go.

558
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,770
What is this place?

559
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:03,315
[Darius] Looks like a lost and found
for the whole mountain.

560
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,537
I think maybe Adam
was right about these people.

561
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,122
We should go.

562
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,207
[footsteps]

563
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,670
[whispering] Guys, guys, shh.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

564
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:31,927
[Jen] Is that them?

565
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,430
- Those hunters from town?
- I don't know.

566
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,973
I-I can't...

567
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,226
That's Adam.

568
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,729
That's Adam.

569
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,149
[blade unsheathes]

570
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,942
[Jen] Darius, no.

571
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,867
Hey, hey. Put him down right now.

572
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,411
Put him the fuck down!

573
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,000
[speaks in foreign language]

574
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,627
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't understand.

575
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,129
[speaking foreign language]

576
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,839
Speak English.

577
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,093
- Oh, my God, Adam.
- Is he dead?

578
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,720
[Darius] Hey, where's our friend?

579
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,388
Where's our friend?
Did you take her? Did you?

580
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,474
Did you kill her? Answer me!

581
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,185
- Where is she? What'd you do?
- Did you fucking take her? Hey!

582
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,728
I will fucking kill you! Back up!

583
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,147
Get the fuck back!

584
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,483
[Jen] Where is she?
What did you do with her?

585
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,026
Where is she? Where the fuck is she?

586
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,487
- [speaking foreign language]
- I can't fucking understand you.

587
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,072
Speak English! Speak English!

588
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,574
[overlapped shouting]

589
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:37,284
[yells]

590
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:55,302
You killed her! You killed her!
You killed her!

591
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:57,471
[grunts]
[yells]

592
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,431
- Adam! Adam!
- You killed her!

593
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,475
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [Darius] Adam, Adam.

594
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,019
[wails]

595
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:08,274
Adam, Adam, Adam. Shit.

596
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,318
- [Adam whimpers]
- [Darius] Shit.

597
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:13,696
- [Adam] Where's the other one?
- [Darius] Oh, shit.

598
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:20,536
He's gone.

599
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:22,871
Oh, my God.

600
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,666
I had to.

601
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:26,917
They...

602
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:29,295
They killed Milla. They...

603
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,088
They killed her.

604
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,799
Adam.

605
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,051
- Adam.
- Oh, my God.

606
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:37,886
[Milla] What happened to you guys?

607
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,097
What the hell's going on here?
What's going...?

608
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,891
What is that?
What the fuck is going on?

609
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,351
Fuck.

610
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,564
What the fuck is that, guys?

611
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,357
What happened?

612
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:52,776
You're alive.

613
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,403
Yes. I'm alive. What is this?

614
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,946
Where have you been?

615
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,240
I left to go pee. I was in the woods.

616
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:01,243
I saw these two huge guys.
They were... they were dressed like this.

617
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:02,828
So I hid in the bush.

618
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,456
We went looking for you.
Didn't you hear us calling?

619
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,541
[Milla] Yeah, but I couldn't answer back,
or else they'd hear me.

620
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,085
By the time they left, you had all gone.

621
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,463
- Babe, what happened to you?
- I thought you were dead.

622
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:14,131
Milla, we thought that they'd taken you,

623
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,551
or-or-or killed you or something.

624
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,429
Did you just kill this man for no reason?

625
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,473
No-no reason?

626
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,850
They dragged me into a fucking hole,

627
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,935
trussed me up
like a goddamn Christmas turkey.

628
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,063
Who knows what they were
going to do to me?

629
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,732
All we know for sure
is that you just killed someone.

630
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:35,444
They were going to kill me, okay?

631
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,821
Look at him. He's a...
He's a fucking animal.

632
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,656
He's right. Listen, listen.

633
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,992
There's one fucking dead guy
on the ground, the other one left.

634
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:43,452
We don't know how many more there are.

635
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,246
We have to get the fuck
off of this mountain, right?

636
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,664
What about the body?

637
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,750
Yeah, what about it?
I mean, we left Gary.

638
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:53,003
Yeah. When we get back to town,
we'll let the fucking police

639
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,422
- handle this shit.
- No, fuck that.

640
00:36:55,798 --> 00:37:00,010
No way. I-I-I am not turning myself over
to some redneck judge.

641
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:02,054
No, fuck that.
We-we-we were never here.

642
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,098
We were never here.

643
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,683
So we just walk away from this?

644
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,435
Yes.

645
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,687
What about the other one? He saw us.

646
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,065
Oh, the other one.
The really friendly-looking one

647
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,734
with the skull mask
that was... that was speaking tongues?

648
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,986
Yeah, I'm sure he's a regular
at city council meetings.

649
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,364
- Dude, listen. Hey, hey, listen.
- [Adam] They were gonna kill me!

650
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,990
Listen, okay, I get it.
They didn't kill Milla.

651
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:25,786
But the-the-the snare trap
and the lumber mill, right?

652
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,414
- And Adam tied to a fucking log?
- Yes, yes.

653
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,916
I mean, who fucking knows?
They probably killed Gary.

654
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,961
Like, these are clearly not good people.

655
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,090
We got to get the fuck out of here, guys.

656
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,926
Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on.

657
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,553
[Milla] Come on.

658
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,225
[Adam] <i>We're still headed east.</i>

659
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,811
Once we find a stream,
we can follow it down the mountain.

660
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,521
Why don't we just go straight down?

661
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,398
You want to take a header off a cliff?
Be my guest.

662
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,525
Okay, you don't have to be
a fucking bitch about it. I get it.

663
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,402
It's my fault. I should've
announced I was leaving to go pee.

664
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,571
- [Adam] It's okay. Forget it.
- [Darius] Fuck.

665
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:02,656
We should've grabbed some
of that climbing gear we saw.

666
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:05,242
No, it's good we didn't touch
anything, right? No traces?

667
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,202
If we've done nothing wrong,
we have nothing to hide.

668
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:11,206
Jesus, fucking quit it
with the morality police bullshit, Jen.

669
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,666
You're clueless about what you want

670
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,043
for your own blessed
all-American white girl life,

671
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,171
and yet you know exactly
what's right for everybody else?

672
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,755
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Really?

673
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,549
Do we honestly not know
what's right and wrong here?

674
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,677
What's right for you
has nothing to do with anyone else.

675
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,262
What's right should be right, period.

676
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,305
- [Adam] Look...
- It's not for you to say.

677
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,265
The guy's dead. It's over.

678
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,642
We're not talking about it
to anybody, all right?

679
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:31,768
Whatever.

680
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:34,104
[Darius] Hey, how about we all
just shut up and relax?

681
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:35,647
Let's see if we can make that happen.

682
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,316
Fuck.

683
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,067
Jesus Christ.

684
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:49,870
[Jen] Oh, my God! Darius!

685
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,790
Are you okay? Are you okay?

686
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:55,709
Another fucking trap.

687
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,046
Still think these people aren't monsters?

688
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:03,842
[Milla] Ooh, okay. It's not that bad.

689
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,260
You're lucky you didn't tear an artery.

690
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,970
[Jen] Where'd it come from?

691
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,515
Must've stepped on something
to trigger it.

692
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,225
Fuck this place.

693
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:15,812
Thanks... again.

694
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,774
You're welcome. Again.

695
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,443
- [Darius laughs]

Good morning.

You're late. And you're carpool today.

- I know.
- I have class.

767
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,755
I got a meeting in Saddle River

and a concrete guy in Millburn.

769

- Hey.
- Hey.

770
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,718
- You haven't heard from Jen, have you?
- Why would she call me?

771
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:40,595
- Because you're her mom.
- Don't say "mom."

772
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,558
She hates that. Get your stuff.
You have one minute.

773
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,184
Jenny, it's your dad.

774
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:50,188
I'm, uh, just calling again
to see how you're doing.

775
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:53,066
I hope you're having fun
with your friends.

776
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,902

Want to know why she doesn't call?

790
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:26,224
Jennifer went off to find herself,

791
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:29,060
which is a choice she made
to avoid making a choice.

792
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:33,607
Look, how about you focus
on my boys, our boys?

793
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,233

"He killed my brother Samuel."

879
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:51,664
No. We didn't know.

880
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,375
They were wearing skulls,

881
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:57,044
and their bodies were covered
with leaves and blood.

882
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:01,257
What we wear when we go hunting, huh?

883
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,052
To hide our scent and our faces
from our prey.

884
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:06,846

Did this man murder
Morgan's brother, Samuel?

It's not murder.

902
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:30,721
We thought they were kidnapping him.

903
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:32,974
We thought they were taking him
somewhere to kill him.

Why? Why did you think this?

00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:38,312

It was a mistake.

<i>Vee nor.</i> What...?

1060
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:54,261
"Friends?"

1061
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,846
Does that mean "friends?"

1062
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,686
- [laughs]
- [man grunts]

1063
01:07:06,899 --> 01:07:08,650
[Edith]
Come with me.

1064
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:29,755
[door creaks open]

1065
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:00,494
[Venable] I've had no wife for a year.

1066
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:10,128
She died in a fall.

1067
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:17,177
Here, people die
of either accidents or old age.

1068
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:23,016
Can we ever leave?

1069
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,607
Why would you want to?

1070
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,537
I know about life below.

1071
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,206
You're alone.

1072
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:52,462
People come to the mountains
looking for something.

1073
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:57,968
Something to remind them
that life is worth living.

1074
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:05,767
You came looking for something.

1075
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:09,563
[sighs]

1076
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:12,899
And now you've found it.

1077
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,672
You're not as strong as you pretend to be.

1078
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:02,240
[phone line ringing]

1079
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,953
[Jen, over voicemail]
<i>Hey, it's Jen.</i>

1080
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,747
<i>Leave a message, and I'll hit you back.</i>

1081
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,499
<i>Thanks. Bye.</i>

1082
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:12,459
[computerized voice]
<i>The mailbox is full</i>

1083
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,336
<i>and cannot accept any messages
at this time. Goodbye.</i>

1084
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:15,962
[phone rings]

1085
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:19,007
Hi.

1086
01:10:19,091 --> 01:10:21,551
<i>No. I don't know.</i>

1087
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:23,220
<i>Maybe a couple more days.</i>

1088
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:26,640
<i>I'm waiting to hear back
from the local police before I move on.</i>

1089
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,810
I know.

1090
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:32,687
She's, uh... she's missing.

1091
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:34,731
[country music playing]

1092
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:51,832
[sighs]

1093
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:54,418
Hello.

1094
01:10:55,794 --> 01:10:57,838
I'm sorry about your daughter
and her friends.

1095
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:00,590
- [waitress] Double whiskey.
- Thank you.

1096
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:04,511
I told her to stay on the trail.

1097
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:08,890
There are people living on that mountain.

1098
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,894
What people?

1099
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,858
The Foundation.

1100
01:11:19,151 --> 01:11:20,861
The Foundation?

1101
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:24,364
It's a story people here know
but don't talk about,

1102
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:26,241
except in whispers.

1103
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:27,868
Like a ghost story.

1104
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,161
Oh.

1105
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:34,749
In 1859, a dozen or so families
packed up and fled up the mountain.

1106
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:39,212
They feared the collapse of America,
and wanted to protect their way of life.

1107
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:41,590
They said when America fell,

1108
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:47,179
they would be the foundation
on which a new nation would be built.

1109
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:52,350
And these descendants of these people

1110
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:56,021
are still living up there on the mountain?

1111
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:58,607
We don't bother them,
and they don't bother us.

1112
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:04,321
But anyone who goes up there,
they don't come back...

1113
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:06,698
alive or dead.

1114
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,869
And you know this how?

1115
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:13,371
It's happened before.

1116
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:14,915
But if it's happened before,

1117
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:17,709
why hasn't someone
done something about it?

1118
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:20,086
Because...

1119
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:23,757
it's made to look like they left.

1120
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:26,676
I'm sorry.

1121
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:51,201
[grunts]

1122
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:57,791
You just don't listen, do you, mister?

1123
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:08,510
Your girl is dead,
and you don't want to find what's left.

1124
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,512
She's not dead.

1125
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:12,430
[all grunting]

1126
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,516
Oh, you son of a...

1127
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:17,435
[siren chirps]

1128
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:21,815
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1129
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,025
Hey.

1130
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:25,610
Hey!

1131
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,530
No, no, no.

1132
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,031
No! No!

1133
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:31,908
- Get him up.
- Hey!

1134
01:13:31,992 --> 01:13:34,911
You son of a bitch.

1135
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:44,087
[spits]

1136
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:01,688
Oh, shit.

1137
01:14:06,318 --> 01:14:08,236
What are you doing?

1138
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,988
What does it look like I'm doing?

1139
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:11,615
You don't want to go up there.

1140
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:14,326
She's my daughter. I'm gonna find her.

1141
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:15,285
Scott...

1142
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:17,579
And there's nothing you can do to stop me.

1143
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,372
Jesus. What happened?

1144
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,543
Whatever happened to you
is nothing compared to what they'll do.

1145
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:26,796
Wait.

1146
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,884
I could help you.

1147
01:14:46,191 --> 01:14:47,942
[car doors open and close]

1148
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:49,444
This him?

1149
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,071
Yes.

1150
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:52,614
Ed, this is Mr. Shaw.

1151
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:56,117
Ed's my nephew. He's a hunter.

1152
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:58,036
You get in a car wreck or something?

1153
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:00,080
Or something.

1154
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:01,831
You got the money?

1155
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:06,169
[Scott] Five thousand.

1156
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,630
[trunk closes]

1157
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,800
Okay.

1158
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,344
We'll see you in the morning, then.

1159
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,929
[Scott] No, no.

1160
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,639
We go now.

1161
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:20,892
You got gear?

1162
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,853
Can't go up there
dressed for no ladies' tea.

1163
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:25,480
You need glasses?

1164
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:27,941
Backpack, sleeping bag, poles.

1165
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,818
Okay, okay, okay. Coop.

1166
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:32,362
Toss me my go bag.

1167
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:36,366
I got everything you need in there.

1168
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:39,077
Why don't you go and take that
yellow jacket off your back.

1169
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,287
Look like a fucking bull's-eye
walking around.

1170
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,747
Give the keys to Aileen.

1171
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:44,416
She'll park your car outside the inn,

1172
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,835
make it look like
you been there all night.

1173
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:48,878
Hey, let me ask you a question.

1174
01:15:48,962 --> 01:15:50,338
Why'd you agree to do this?

1175
01:15:50,422 --> 01:15:52,257
[Ed] Money.

1176
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,051
Got a son here I want to send
through welding school,

1177
01:15:55,135 --> 01:15:59,222
and I ain't got no love
for them Foundation fuckers.

1178
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:02,475
Arrow did that.

1179
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:04,978
Nineteen stitches.

1180
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:08,648
A warning shot across the old brain pan
to keep off of their mountain.

1181
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,776
Wouldn't mind returning the favor.

1182
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stay back.

1183
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,093
Stake trap.

1184
01:16:37,177 --> 01:16:39,637
Sneaky motherfuckers.

1185
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:41,514
Get out of the creek.

1186
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,107
[Ed] These Foundation folks
like to set traps like these

1187
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:53,026
to drive strangers up off the mountain.

1188
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:57,614
There's a second set further up
where I got my trophy.

1189
01:16:57,697 --> 01:17:00,200
What comes after the second set?

1190
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:02,869
Strangers don't get to leave.

1191
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,455
You walk where I walk.

1192
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,544
[exhales]

1193
01:17:13,505 --> 01:17:14,756
Jesus.

1194
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,257
How much further?

1195
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:19,052
There's a steep trail up along this ridge.

1196
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,971
I won't lie, though.
It's a bitch of a hike.

1197
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:24,557
But it shortcuts us right up
to the bastards' front door.

1198
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:25,809
[screams]

1199
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:28,019
Cooper! Cooper!

1200
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:29,896
Cooper, you hurt?

1201
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:31,564
Are you all right?

1202
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:32,982
I think I twisted my ankle.

1203
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,109
Christ. Come on, help me pull him out.

1204
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:37,153
Okay, give me your hand.

1205
01:17:37,237 --> 01:17:38,696
[Cooper groans]

1206
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:42,033
[grunts]

1207
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:44,536
[Scott] Give me your other hand.

1208
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:51,626
[groans]

1209
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:57,882
[Ed] Come on. Come on.

1210
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:00,051
Come on.

1211
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,511
[grunts]

1212
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:18,319
[Scott] What?

1213
01:18:25,994 --> 01:18:27,704
Cooper?

1214
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,669
Jesus.

1215
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:12,290
[breathing heavily]

1216
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:16,586
One step at a time.

1217
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1218
01:19:54,374 --> 01:19:56,876
[twigs snap]

1219
01:19:58,211 --> 01:19:59,837
[faint rustling]

1220

[coughs]

1224

Darius?

1225
01:20:34,998 --> 01:20:37,250
Uh, it's me.

1226
01:20:41,129 --> 01:20:42,630
Where's Jen?

1227
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:46,759
What's happened to you?

1228
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:54,684
What the fuck is happening?

1229
01:20:57,437 --> 01:20:59,022
Where's my daughter?

1230
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:01,649
Stay back.

1231
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:09,657
[gunshots]

1232
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:12,827
What's wrong with you people?

[grunts]

1234
01:21:37,685 --> 01:21:39,062
Jen?

1235
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:42,732
Jen.

1236
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:46,778
What have they done to you?

1237
01:21:56,871 --> 01:21:58,748
What have you done to my daughter?

1238
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:09,550
Whoever you are...
this woman is not your daughter.

1239
01:22:09,634 --> 01:22:12,345
She's my wife.

1240
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,263
What are you talking about?

1241
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:17,016
[speaking foreign language]

1242
01:22:18,726 --> 01:22:20,520
[all chanting in foreign language]

1243
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:22,021
[Scott] What the fuck is that?

1244
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:24,315
[Venable] No trial is necessary.

1245
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:27,318
We find this stranger guilty
of trespassing.

1246
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:30,905
The sentence is darkness,
to be carried out at dawn.

1247
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:32,782
What are you saying?

1248
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,492
Hey... Ah!

1249
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:38,704
You won't get away with this.

1250
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:40,623
People will come for me.

1251
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,041
They know where I am!

1252
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:44,585
No. No one will ever come.

1253
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:46,379
[Scott] Jennifer!

1254
01:22:55,096 --> 01:22:57,390
[Venable] Are you all right?

1255
01:22:57,473 --> 01:22:59,600
I'm fine.

1256
01:22:59,684 --> 01:23:01,310
Why?

1257
01:23:01,394 --> 01:23:05,523
That man is your father.

1258
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,496
I've made my choice.

1259
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:30,047
[yelling]

1260
01:23:30,131 --> 01:23:32,967
[panting]
[grunting]

1261
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:44,312
[footsteps approaching]

1262
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:47,982
- [thumping]
- [rocks shifting]

1263
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,698
- Jen.
- Shh.

1264
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,492
[whispering] We don't have much time.

1265
01:23:58,576 --> 01:24:01,579
You found your way up here.
Do you know a safe way back?

1266
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:04,457
Okay.

1267
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,209
Let's go.

1268
01:24:11,005 --> 01:24:12,965
You shot me with an arrow.

1269
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
They would've killed us both.
Come on, let's go.

1270
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:28,898
[gasps]
[pants]

1271
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:38,908
What is this?

1272
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,284
Time to leave.

1273
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:42,119
Why now?

1274
01:24:42,203 --> 01:24:44,413
Because tomorrow morning,
they're gonna kill my dad.

1275
01:24:45,164 --> 01:24:46,332
We need to go.

1276
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:48,125
Come on.

1277
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:49,752
[Darius] I'm not going.

1278
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,839
What?

1279
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:55,800
These people see me.

1280
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:58,010
I belong to them.

1281
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,555
They belong to me.

1282
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:04,517
Go.

1283
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:07,520
I won't stop you.

1284
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:22,827
Do you really think you can
go back to your old life?

1285
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:40,636
Stay close.

1286
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:50,021
This gate's never locked like this.

1287
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:53,149
Jen.

1288
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:02,074
Ruthie.

1289
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:04,744
I have to go.

1290
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:06,287
Do you understand?

1291
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:11,292
I know you like to sneak down
the mountain sometimes.

1292
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,127
Do you know another way out?

1293
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:58,005
Through there?

1294
01:26:58,089 --> 01:26:59,924
You're saying there's a way out
through there?

1295
01:27:15,106 --> 01:27:17,441
Do you want to come with me, Ruthie?

1296
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,695
You can if you want to.

1297
01:27:32,206 --> 01:27:34,583
[door opens]

1298
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,763

[gasps]

1300
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:56,730
Let's go.

1301
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,035
[croaking]

1302
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,000

[Jen panting]

1304
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:48,968
[Scott] Aw, geez.

1305
01:29:50,553 --> 01:29:52,471
I barely made it up here in the daylight.

1306
01:29:52,555 --> 01:29:53,764
Shh!

1307
01:29:54,932 --> 01:29:56,433
[whispers] Did you hear that?

1308
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:04,191
[yelps]

1309
01:30:06,402 --> 01:30:08,779

1312
01:30:19,873 --> 01:30:21,250
Jen!

1313
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:24,003
Jen!

1314
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:26,088
[men shouting distantly]

1315
01:30:34,221 --> 01:30:36,557

[whispering] Dad.

1318
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:45,774
Dad.

1319
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:51,864
Jen?

1320
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jen?

1321
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,012
[Hobbs] I can smell your juices.

1322
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:18,974
- [yells]
- [screams]

1323

[gasping]

1324
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:30,235
After Venable takes your eyes,
your ears, and your tongue,

1325
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:31,862
I'm going to keep you for myself.

1326
01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:33,822
- [yells]
- [knife thuds]

1327

1331
01:32:09,066 --> 01:32:10,150
Jen?

Jennifer.

1336
01:32:39,638 --> 01:32:41,140
All right.

1337
01:32:41,223 --> 01:32:42,891
[sobbing softly]

1338
01:32:47,938 --> 01:32:49,690
Hey.

1339
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:05,706
[panting]

1340

[breathing heavily]

1344
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:41,033
What do we do now?

1345
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:45,287
All that matters now is the next choice.

1346
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,165
That's what I've learned on this mountain.

1347
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:52,419
That's how I've survived.

1348
01:33:58,592 --> 01:34:00,594
[gun clicks]

1349
01:34:12,105 --> 01:34:13,482
Let's go.

1350
01:34:25,661 --> 01:34:28,205
[gasping]

1351
01:34:28,372 --> 01:34:30,082
[panting] Which way?

1352
01:34:35,879 --> 01:34:37,589
Told you I'd see you again.

1353
01:34:38,507 --> 01:34:41,260
Back the fuck up!

1354
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:42,803
Whoa, wait a minute. We're here to help.

1355
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,847
- Bullshit.
- And fuck you, too.

1356
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:47,724
Hey, mister, I was trying
to save your life back there.

1357
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:51,228
I figured a good beat down
might send your ass packing.

1358
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:53,063
And you.

1359
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:56,191
That yellow in my eyes...

1360
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:58,735
was my liver turning on me.

1361
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:00,445
You were right.

1362
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:04,199
Look, I ain't got any kids.

1363
01:35:04,283 --> 01:35:09,454
But my nephew disappeared
in these woods six years ago.

1364
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:12,624
And I never found the body.

1365
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:14,751
Fucking Foundation.

1366
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:18,380
I'd like to shoot every one
of those sons of bitches.

1367
01:35:19,965 --> 01:35:21,717
Where's your friends?

1368
01:35:22,593 --> 01:35:24,386
It's just us.

1369
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:27,347
Well, then, let's get you
the hell off this mountain.

1370
01:35:29,975 --> 01:35:31,602
Come on.

1371
01:35:39,026 --> 01:35:40,736
Ah!

1372
01:35:45,449 --> 01:35:47,326
- [Lloyd] Fuck!
- [Scott] No, no, no!

1373
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:50,203
- I'll get you.
- [Osborn] Where the fuck is it?

1374
01:35:56,627 --> 01:35:58,545
[Jen groaning loudly]

1375
01:35:58,629 --> 01:36:00,380
[screams]

1376
01:36:01,924 --> 01:36:03,634
[Nate] I think we got 'em.

1377
01:36:03,717 --> 01:36:05,844
[Jen breathing heavily]

1378
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:16,563
[meaty thud]

1379
01:36:21,485 --> 01:36:23,028
[Jen groaning]

1380
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:26,531
[Nate] Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1381
01:36:28,659 --> 01:36:30,327
[truck doors slam]

1382
01:36:30,494 --> 01:36:32,371
[Venable] Jennifer!

1383
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:35,165
[Nate] Get in the truck.

1384
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:36,667
Get in.

1385
01:36:38,085 --> 01:36:39,544
[engine starts]

1386
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:49,888
[glass shatters]

1387
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:44,151
[Nate] It's my Great-Uncle Willie's
special recipe.

1388
01:37:47,029 --> 01:37:48,864
All right, suit yourself.

1389
01:38:25,317 --> 01:38:28,195
I want to set that footing
by tomorrow evening.

1390
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:30,197
- Yeah. Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, Dad.

1391
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,907
I brought you the revised blueprints

1392
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:33,742
- for the North Caldwell house.
- Oh, you're kidding.

1393
01:38:33,825 --> 01:38:35,702
You didn't need to bring them
all the way down here.

1394
01:38:35,786 --> 01:38:37,412
I know you wanted to see them right away.

1395
01:38:37,496 --> 01:38:40,373
I also know you're gonna hate
the new master bath.

1396
01:38:40,457 --> 01:38:42,125
Well, you did warn me.

1397
01:38:42,209 --> 01:38:43,293
Mm-hm.

1398
01:38:45,629 --> 01:38:46,838
What?

1399
01:38:46,922 --> 01:38:49,132
Nothing. I'm just proud of you.

1400
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:51,968
Thanks, Dad.

1401
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:55,430
Come on.

1402
01:38:58,809 --> 01:39:00,435
I love you.

1403
01:39:00,519 --> 01:39:02,312
I love you, too.

1404
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:09,569
Well, good night.

1405
01:39:09,653 --> 01:39:10,987
I'll see you at home.

1406
01:39:12,489 --> 01:39:14,282
Oh, and remember,
it's pizza and movie night,

1407
01:39:14,366 --> 01:39:15,867
so don't be late.

1408
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:19,412
The boys picked something
with inbred cannibals?

1409
01:39:19,496 --> 01:39:20,914
Again?

1410
01:39:21,957 --> 01:39:24,417
- Geez.
- [laughs]

1411

1413
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,651
[Miles] It's a privacy screen.

1414
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:51,069
- [man] Oh.
- [Miles] Yeah.

1415
01:39:51,153 --> 01:39:52,362
You can't see it from the side.

1416
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:54,030
[Corinne] All right, here we go.

1417
01:39:54,114 --> 01:39:55,490
Oh, hi, hon.

1418
01:39:55,574 --> 01:39:59,369
Uh, meet our new neighbors,
John and Ruthie.

1419
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:02,247
They're looking at the Kaplan
house down the street.

1420
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:03,832
Nothing is set in stone yet.

1421
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:06,293
[Corinne]
Well, it turns out John knows Scott.

1422
01:40:06,376 --> 01:40:08,837
[Venable] Our paths crossed.

1423
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:13,341
Said if I was ever in the neighborhood
to stop by and meet the family.

1424
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:16,136
[Corinne] Small world, right?

1425
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:19,222
Yes. Very.

1426
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:24,144
Are you going to put those groceries down?

1427
01:40:26,062 --> 01:40:27,314
[Venable] Corinne...

1428
01:40:27,397 --> 01:40:29,941
this coffee is wonderful, thank you.

1429
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:33,069
[Corinne] Uh, can you stay for dinner?

1430
01:40:33,153 --> 01:40:35,780
I'm sure Scott would love to see you.

1431
01:40:35,864 --> 01:40:38,116
We're having pizza.

1432
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,035
Yes.

1433
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:43,079
We would love to stay.

1434
01:40:43,163 --> 01:40:45,207
It's been a long drive.

1435
01:40:46,625 --> 01:40:49,544
- Thank you.
- Oh, be right back.

1436
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:54,132
And I see you're eating for two.

1437
01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:58,303
Congratulations.

1438
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:00,180
I need to use the bathroom.

1439
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:28,041
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- [Corinne] Jen!

1440
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:31,253
Put your weapon down,
or I kill your family.

1441
01:41:34,756 --> 01:41:36,549
I was wrong about you, Jen.

1442
01:41:38,051 --> 01:41:39,344
You are strong.

1443
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:42,264
I had to be if I was ever
gonna get away from you.

1444
01:41:42,347 --> 01:41:44,140
Now it's time to come home.

1445
01:41:44,224 --> 01:41:46,393
What's the point? You have to kill me.

1446
01:41:46,476 --> 01:41:47,394
[Venable] Yes.

1447
01:41:48,478 --> 01:41:51,147
But not until our child is born.

1448
01:41:53,692 --> 01:41:56,069
Congratulations, Grandma.

1449
01:41:56,486 --> 01:41:58,697
[yells]

1450
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:08,790
[grunts]

1451
01:42:11,293 --> 01:42:12,961
[gasping softly]

1452
01:42:23,555 --> 01:42:24,848
[Corinne] Jen...

1453
01:42:27,434 --> 01:42:29,644
what are you doing?

1454
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,230
Jen?

1455
01:42:36,443 --> 01:42:38,320
[Jen] Mom?

1456
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:41,239
Can you and the boys excuse us?

1457
01:42:41,323 --> 01:42:43,992
John's here to talk business.

1458
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:46,703
Of course. Come on. Laundry.

1459
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:50,790
Come on. You want pizza? Mush.

1460
01:43:04,471 --> 01:43:06,639
I was wrong about you, Jen.

1461
01:43:06,723 --> 01:43:09,142
You are strong.

1462
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:12,687
I had to be if I was ever
gonna get away from you.

1463
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:15,273
You let us make you strong.

1464
01:43:15,357 --> 01:43:17,692
That's good.

1465
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:20,570
You're carrying my child, so...

1466
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:25,325
time to come home.

1467
01:43:29,454 --> 01:43:31,081
Promise me you won't hurt them.

1468
01:43:34,084 --> 01:43:35,460
Ever.

1469
01:43:37,879 --> 01:43:39,964
You'll never come back here.

1470
01:43:41,257 --> 01:43:42,967
Promise, and I'll go with you.

1471
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:45,804
You have my word.
