Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

The police is still looking

after twenty-one years
College student Heather Price.

6
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:33,577
She has been missing for three days,

7
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,580
after last
a friend had visited in "Mills Falls"

8
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,708
At the time of her disappearance
she wore a striped sweater,

9
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,873

The police are looking for anyone who notes

Photo will be uploaded

12
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,906
The time has come.

13
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,197
Kill Kristy,

14
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:19,291
Kristy: Female first name
Latin origin.

15
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:21,910
Kristy means follower of Christ.

16
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,751
Kill Kristy, then you kill God.

17
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:35,054
Kristy is pretty,
innocent and sheltered

18
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,765
Find them,

19
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,196
Follow her,

20
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,819
Recognize your fear,

21
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,540
mobile phone jammer

22
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,886
Photo will be uploaded

23
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,019
Let all partake of your work

24
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,269
Together we are strong.

25
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,944
They are weak.

26
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,585
You are Kristy.

27
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,870
To see the world in a grain of sand
and heaven in a wild flower,

28
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:11,441
hall infinity in your hand
and the hour is for eternity.

29
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:15,486
A robin in a cage
calls the wrath of heaven ...

30
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:17,157
Can not you even be serious?

31
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,618
I have to laugh.
because you sound so bored.

32
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:24,033
No, I think it's not boring.
I just do not know how to unravel it.

33
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,753
This is poetry, you nerd
No dry physics.

34
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:30,122
Did you just "nerd"
said to me? - Yes.

35
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,006
This is not an equation
or a formula, but interpretation.

36
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,255
As for poetry,
can hold a candle Hardly Blake.

37
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,973
Therefore, the best way is perhaps
mentally to slip into his skin.

38
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,393
Not in all of us
slumbers a writer

39
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,974
A dormant writer

40
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,604
Sounds interesting. - Okay,
a two in the course can I forget.

41
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,230
I focus
on the other subjects,

42
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:58,074
I save at least my
Scholarship. - I'll help you.

43
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:00,945
You wanted to start driving time
remember?

44
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,163
Sulking because someone?
You did not come.

45
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,701
Everything good, Aaron. You got me
? achgelegt, now you can go.

46
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:08,834
Take with Nicole, if you want

47
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,294
Is it idiotic,
Thanksgiving hang out here alone?

48
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:15,926
A long weekend, two girls
innocent and alone, you can find idiotic?

49
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:19,171
Actually, this sounds hot. - That's right!
Too bad that you can not be there.

50
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:20,763
Down there! - Just you wait. you!

51
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:39,487
Heisenberg dealt with the limits
the Predictable. When light for example.

52
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:43,862
We know exactly what happened,
when sodium nitrate meets water. Boom!

53
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:46,832
But no, the turbulence
Qualms of the previously calculated.

54
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,380
I know, Mom., We have already
discussed. The flights are really expensive.

55
00:06:57,415 --> 00:07:00,424
Every time for the holidays
explode prices.

56
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,676
No, I just said, explode prices
Yes, I'll see you at Christmas.

57
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:06,426
And you've got to happiness
Tammy and the baby.

58
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,020
Should I leave the lights on, Justine?

59
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:13,776
No, you can make it quiet
I'm also almost finished.

60
00:07:13,811 --> 00:07:16,234
Come on, come with me.
I swear to you, she lets you in peace

61
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,863
I will never forget the 4th of July
where they asked me

62
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:21,031
as for my career
as a dishwasher so runs.

63
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,036
Since she has misunderstood what.
- But she already understands that some people

64
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:26,871
for their livelihood
have to work. - Now is time well.

65
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:29,493
My goodness,
sometimes you're something of stubborn.

66
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:32,081
What should I do
so are you satisfied?

67
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,967
I want you to stay here.
With me. Just this once.

68
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:45,055
You know my family
I must go there.

69
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,059
Einstein's universe
is a universe of order,

70
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:54,100
in principle, everything is predictable
Whereas Heisenberg theorized,

71
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:57,194
the world is chaotic by nature
and ultimately not predictable.

72
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,401
Your missing me terribly.

73
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:02,070
Hey, Justine!

74
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,695
That was Scott the caretaker

75
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,704
You're also soon end, yes?

76
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:18,630
So then I wish you a nice
Thanksgiving. - I wish you well, Greg.

77
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:23,967
A famous quote that Einstein at least
is attributed, is: God does not play dice.

78
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:27,557
In contrast, according to Heisenberg's approach
dices God continually,

79
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,728
Say it. - What can I say?

80
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,389
You know.

81
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,608
Your high-tech weapons
not work for me unfortunately.

82
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,697
Say it. - Come on, Aaron.

83
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:48,366
I love you.

84
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,789
I raise you, Justine,

85
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,470
Have a good trip,

86
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,186
Come on.

87
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,618
Until then.

88
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,076
Hi, Wayne, how are you?
- Hey! Well, you alone at heart?

89
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:57,491
I console myself with wash laundering and
Then I stick my nose in the books.

90
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

91
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,902
Oh shit!
- Oh my God, I'm sorry.

92
00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:37,829
Are you okay? - Yes, all right.
But this light makes me really ready.

93
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:42,210
Say. is this the whole weekend
remain so? - Well, as I know my luck.

94
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:43,374
God

95
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,626
There you go, who says's it.

96
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,715
Do you still have space in the machine?

97
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,799
You're the best.
And do not forget the sweets.

98
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,639
No, never.
as I could. - See you soon!

99
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:01,267
The windows were smashed and the
Tire was found dried sludge residues.

100
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:03,606
The investigators gave further known
that her body

101
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,272
in a nearby
Has found dumpster.

102
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:08,067
They assume,
that a connection

103
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:12,152
to the recently reported disappearance
of two other women there.

104
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,161
Hello, Anna. And?
You fly to London today?

105
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:22,451
No, only to friends in the north.
Nicole and you, will you really stay here?

106
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:26,455
Yes. the turkey pie
sizzles already in the oven. - Doswidanje.

107
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,081
Happy Thanksgiving.

108
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,002
Yes, all good.
I know, Dad

109
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,651
If it breaks up
I can do that too.

110
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:38,425
Okay. then we long afterwards,
I love you too.

111
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,100
You're not serious? - Please do not be angry,
my dad has suddenly appeared.

112
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,975
As a surprise, he has
the whole family invited to Aspen.

113
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,022
Okay.
- I'm about to pick up.

114
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,271
Come with me also.
A plane ticket I'll get you yet.

115
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:53,865
No, thank you.
- You can not stay here all alone.

116
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,951
Hi, Jus! - All good.
I get by, honest

117
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,031
I'm really sorry. I swear
I wanted to hang out with you.

118
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:03,032

and the whole family will be there.
And it's Aspen. - All good, Nicole.

120
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:09,170
I understand that but everything
Family is family.

121
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,550
But promise me. that you do not
all the time on campus hang around.

122
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:15,091
Driving times and get some fresh air,
somewhere into the green.

123
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,474
You can take my baby,
- Better not, because if something goes wrong.

124
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:23,060
Please, take it now already.
I know you're very keen on it.

Thank you.

Quiet and peaceful.
