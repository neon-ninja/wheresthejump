1
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:04,399
EYES WITHOUT A FACE

2
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,366
The professor?

3
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:06,535
No, not yet.

4
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,834
I'll tell him, once he's finished.

5
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:19,172
<i>Is not the greatest of man's new hopes</i>

6
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:21,675
<i>that of physical rejuvenation?</i>

7
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,346
<i>This hope comes with the heterograft.</i>

8
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:29,391
<i>But the heterograft –
in other words, the transplanting</i>

9
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:35,522
<i>of living tissue or organs
from one human being to another –</i>

10
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:37,983
<i>has only been possible until now</i>

11
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:41,194
<i>when both subjects in question</i>

12
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:44,781
<i>were perfectly identical
from a biological standpoint.</i>

13
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:49,035
<i>This means biologically modifying</i>

14
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:54,207
<i>the nature of the host organism.</i>

15
00:06:54,291 --> 00:07:02,340
One method involves using
heavy X-ray irradiation

16
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:07,178
to destroy the antibodies that create
resistance to the heterograft.

17
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:13,059
Unfortunately, this irradiation
requires such a high level of intensity

18
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:17,230
that no human being can survive it.

19
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:21,401
So we resort to exsanguination.

20
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:26,114
We drain every last drop of blood

21
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:28,491
from the subject
exposed to radiation.

22
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:39,210
- You just had a call, Professor.
- From whom?

23
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:42,589
The medico-legal –
You know, the morgue.

24
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:45,050
They want to see you right away.

25
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:48,970
Oh, Professor,
your lecture was so invigorating.

26
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:51,181
Thrilling, wasn't it, Carlo?

27
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:53,725
What a wonderful future
you've shown us.

28
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:58,104
The future, madame, is something
we should have started on long ago.

29
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,741
He's changed so much
since his daughter vanished.

30
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,910
He says such strange things.

31
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:24,422
<i>It's a strange business,
but that's how it looks to me.</i>

32
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:28,426
When Génessier's daughter
vanished from the clinic,

33
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,596
her face was an open wound.

34
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,934
True, the missing facial tissue
confirms your theory.

35
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,312
The car accident,

36
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:43,149
the facial burns,
the long immersion in the river.

37
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:46,361
And the rats, Doctor.
Don't forget the rats.

38
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:47,696
True.

39
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:53,827
Still, the drowning victim's description
also fits that of Simone Tessot.

40
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,663
I called the Tessot girl's father down.

41
00:08:58,373 --> 00:09:00,875
Something doesn't quite make sense.

42
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,547
What's odd is the body was fished out
naked... in a man's coat.

43
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:09,801
Why should Génessier's daughter,

44
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:12,887
distraught at her disfigurement,

45
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:19,060
feel the need to strip naked
in mid-winter before drowning herself?

46
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:25,775
And that large open wound
where the face should be –

47
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:28,361
it's strange.

48
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:32,741
The edges are as smooth as if
someone had taken a scalpel to them.

49
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:39,497
Here he is.

50
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:08,234
Dr. Lherminier.

51
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:11,279
Detective Parot,
of the Missing Persons Bureau.

52
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:25,710
I'm so sorry we had to meet
under such unfortunate circumstances.

53
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:27,587
Let's hear it.

54
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,965
This morning, bargemen fished
a girl's body out of the Seine.

55
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:33,718
The time of drowning coincides

56
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:37,639
with that of your daughter's
disappearance.

57
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:41,351
The description also fits.

58
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:45,355
The damaged face...
Only the eyes are intact.

59
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:58,910
IDENTIFICATION ROOM

60
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,104
It's her.

61
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,358
Christiane.

62
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:41,369
Mr. Tessot is here, Doctor.

63
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:46,499
Tell him she's been identified
beyond a doubt. It's not his daughter.

64
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,338
I called him in, in case...

65
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:55,592
Of course.

66
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:08,605
Excuse me, Professor.
I'm Henri Tessot.

67
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:11,274
I'm also here about my daughter.

68
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,985
The custodian said she was yours.

69
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:18,156
Are you really sure, sir?
Are you very sure?

70
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,242
Sadly, sir, only too sure.

71
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:25,371
It was such a shock when they phoned.

72
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:27,415
I thought I'd go mad.

73
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:31,169
It's been 10 days
since we last saw Simone.

74
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:33,838
Something must have happened to her.

75
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:39,677
How odd I should have to comfort you.

76
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:42,889
You still have some hope, at least.

77
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,549
She's looking for a room.

78
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:23,990
With age, he looks
more and more like his father.

79
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:28,327
Remember Génessier, the attorney?
No beanpole, either.

80
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,456
He sure has had a string of bad luck.

81
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:36,753
Losing his wife four years ago...
now his daughter.

82
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:42,050
Paris, fame, fortune –
what's it all add up to?

83
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:57,774
Who's the young man?

84
00:14:57,857 --> 00:14:59,984
The girl's fiancé.

85
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:03,321
A doctor.
He works with the professor.

86
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:04,989
And the woman?

87
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:07,450
His secretary, it seems.

88
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:09,619
A foreigner.

89
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:11,871
She looks deeply affected.

90
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,340
Go home, son.

91
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:39,524
No, let's go.

92
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:41,192
I like order.

93
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,424
Let's go!
I can't take any more of this.

94
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:11,889
Shut up!

95
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:25,027
TO MY BELOVED DAUGHTER

96
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:41,103
DR. GÉNESSIER'S VILLA

97
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:44,815
NO ADMITTANCE
BEYOND THIS POINT

98
00:21:13,274 --> 00:21:15,109
Where did you find this?

99
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:18,529
I don't like your snooping around.

100
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,452
I have no time to explain it
to you just now.

101
00:21:24,827 --> 00:21:27,830
Sure, you see your name
with a black border around it.

102
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:33,377
What can you possibly be imagining?

103
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,880
I don't have to imagine a thing.

104
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:39,717
I see horrible things.
I'm living them!

105
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,802
What have you done now?

106
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:43,929
What had to be done.

107
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,432
For your own good.

108
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:49,768
Always for your good, Christiane.

109
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:53,939
An obituary notice.

110
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:58,235
Names were simply substituted.

111
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:07,411
Since that girl died
after the operation,

112
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:11,749
I took an additional risk.

113
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,503
I made everyone believe it was you.

114
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:22,343
Everyone thinks you're dead.
They won't look any further.

115
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,680
They won't come around
asking what happened.

116
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:31,101
Christiane, your mask!

117
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:35,481
Get into the habit of wearing it.

118
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:38,859
Where did you hide it?

119
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:40,945
The habit...

120
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,448
I only meant
the habit of wearing it

121
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:48,327
until we succeed.

122
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:52,164
Please don't cry, darling.

123
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,670
I'll succeed, I promise you.

124
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,341
I don't believe it anymore.

125
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:18,232
There's no reason for you
to doubt me.

126
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,570
I know my abilities, don't I?

127
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:27,074
You'll have a real face.

128
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:29,910
I promise you.

129
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:39,753
They've removed all the mirrors,

130
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:42,339
but I can see
my reflection in the glass

131
00:23:42,423 --> 00:23:44,633
when the windows are open.

132
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:46,844
There are lots of shiny surfaces...

133
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:49,346
a knife blade,

134
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,849
varnished wood...

135
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,560
My face frightens me.

136
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:57,062
My mask frightens me even more.

137
00:23:57,146 --> 00:23:59,815
Have faith, Christiane.

138
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:03,527
Look at me.

139
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:05,404
Didn't he succeed with me?

140
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,364
But you had a face.

141
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:12,161
Damaged, maybe,
but not destroyed like mine.

142
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:15,873
He's lying to me,
because he knows it was his fault.

143
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:17,583
His fault?

144
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:21,086
It was a car wreck.
It was an accident.

145
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:25,591
Accident? He has to control everyone,
even on the road!

146
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:28,302
He drove like a lunatic.

147
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:36,477
The crash nearly killed me.
Why did he try so hard to save me?

148
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:39,980
I wish I were blind.

149
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:42,941
Or dead.

150
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:21,034
<i>Who is this?</i>

151
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:23,328
<i>Say something!</i>

152
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,208
I see you're alone, miss.

153
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,294
I have an extra ticket.

154
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:14,963
My friend didn't show up.

155
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,549
I'd be delighted, madame,

156
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:20,802
but I planned to buy
an inexpensive seat.

157
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:23,430
Don't worry.
I'm not asking you to pay.

158
00:29:58,632 --> 00:30:01,426
Sorry I'm late.
My class ran overtime.

159
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,387
It's all right.

160
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,140
I was so anxious
to give you the good news.

161
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:10,102
I found you a room.

162
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:14,272
I can't believe it! I'm so glad.

163
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:15,816
How can I ever thank you?

164
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:20,988
First take a look at the room.
I think you'll like it.

165
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,031
What neighborhood?

166
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:25,200
A lovely neighborhood.

167
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:30,288
The same for the young lady.

168
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:35,752
I'll drive you there.
The owners are friends.

169
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:38,839
It's surrounded by trees.

170
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,389
It seems very far.

171
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:32,726
I took the long way.

172
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:36,480
The traffic's heavy
at this time of day.

173
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:53,663
That's the train
that will take you to Paris.

174
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:55,749
In less than 20 minutes.

175
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:01,755
Don't you feel lonely,
so far from your family?

176
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:05,092
A little, sometimes.

177
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:25,172
Those dogs...

178
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,716
How many are there?

179
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:31,386
You see?
You'll be well protected.

180
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,119
Miss Edna Grüberg.

181
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:58,163
Mr. Dormeuil.

182
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:00,040
Delighted.

183
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,960
Some port
to refresh you after the drive?

184
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:07,756
No, thank you, sir.
I don't want to stay too long.

185
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,509
Come now, there's no hurry.

186
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,143
I'll show you your room.

187
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:23,188
It looks out over the trees.

188
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,023
I'm sure you'll like it.

189
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:27,901
I don't know.
I have to think it over.

190
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:34,991
First, you really must see the room.

191
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:43,041
Of course, at night
it's hard to judge.

192
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:48,421
It's not that, but the suburbs
aren't very convenient for me.

193
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,757
What do you mean?

194
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:54,844
The suburbs are very convenient.
Very convenient.

195
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:57,389
Maybe so, but...

196
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:01,768
I don't want to get back
to Paris too late tonight.

197
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:07,565
I'm meeting a friend.
I'll let you know tomorrow.

198
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,903
Tomorrow will be too late, my dear.

199
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

200
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:01,471
Open up, quickly.

201
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:55,692
I'll start after dinner.

202
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:57,360
This time...

203
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:01,030
I must try removing
a larger section.

204
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:05,618
In one piece.

205
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:08,955
Not in sections.

206
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:26,564
Pencil.

207
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,485
Scalpel.

208
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:05,371
Wipe my brow.

209
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:16,299
Pencil.

210
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:39,614
Scalpel.

211
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:07,850
Forceps.

212
00:48:14,018 --> 00:48:15,853
Here we go.

213
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:39,877
People are all the same.

214
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,129
They love pets
when they're young.

215
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:44,840
When their pets grow up
and eat too much,

216
00:48:44,924 --> 00:48:47,009
they abandon them in the woods.

217
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:51,931
I say you should never
do things halfway.

218
00:48:54,642 --> 00:48:59,939
Especially since the second half
is by far the easiest part.

219
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:32,972
Calm down!

220
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:54,910
Shut up!

221
00:50:13,846 --> 00:50:17,349
Did she eat normally?
- Yes, very well.

222
00:50:17,433 --> 00:50:19,810
She'd been wasting away.

223
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:22,521
She's happy this time.
She has faith.

224
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,773
Finally.

225
00:50:24,857 --> 00:50:27,943
I showed her how nicely it's healing.

226
00:50:28,027 --> 00:50:31,614
I changed the bandages.
It looks fine.

227
00:50:31,697 --> 00:50:33,199
Much better than yesterday.

228
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:37,494
- I'm so afraid.
- Don't be.

229
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:39,830
I have faith this time too.

230
00:50:41,707 --> 00:50:44,168
All I can do is hope.

231
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,633
If this were a success... God!

232
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:52,468
You couldn't put a price on it.

233
00:50:55,054 --> 00:50:57,890
I've done so much wrong
to perform this miracle.

234
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,061
I've done you a lot of wrong, too.

235
00:51:02,144 --> 00:51:06,398
I know, but I'll never forget
that I owe you my face.

236
00:51:09,735 --> 00:51:11,487
I sometimes forget that myself.

237
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,364
With good reason.

238
00:51:13,447 --> 00:51:16,075
There's hardly any trace now.

239
00:51:23,707 --> 00:51:26,627
What have you decided about Edna?

240
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:30,256
Look after her. Feed her.

241
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,926
I'll decide later.

242
00:53:27,873 --> 00:53:30,542
Edna! She's escaped!

243
00:53:30,626 --> 00:53:32,211
That way.

244
00:57:44,296 --> 00:57:47,341
No other details that come to mind?

245
00:57:47,424 --> 00:57:48,634
Well, no.

246
00:57:50,844 --> 00:57:52,929
Yes!

247
00:57:53,013 --> 00:57:56,850
Edna said the woman
always wore a thick pearl necklace.

248
00:57:57,559 --> 00:57:59,895
See what I mean?

249
00:57:59,978 --> 00:58:02,939
She wore it high around her neck,
like a choker.

250
00:58:07,069 --> 00:58:09,446
That doesn't help us much.

251
00:58:12,366 --> 00:58:13,992
Please sign.

252
00:58:19,498 --> 00:58:21,833
That'll be all, young lady.

253
00:58:38,642 --> 00:58:40,686
Pretty, isn't she?

254
00:58:40,769 --> 00:58:43,188
The same series of blue-eyed girls.

255
00:58:44,564 --> 00:58:50,153
All students, all the same age,
all the same type of beauty.

256
00:58:50,237 --> 00:58:52,614
And all mysteriously missing.

257
00:58:52,698 --> 00:58:56,326
This one's Swiss. You can imagine –
the embassy, the phone calls...

258
00:58:58,453 --> 00:59:02,290
Speaking of blue-eyed girls,

259
00:59:02,374 --> 00:59:04,751
what do I do with mine?

260
00:59:04,835 --> 00:59:07,796
She was caught shoplifting.

261
00:59:09,297 --> 00:59:11,633
Give her a stern lecture
and let her go.

262
00:59:11,717 --> 00:59:15,887
But get her address.
It might come in handy.

263
00:59:21,768 --> 00:59:24,688
This is how you end up in prison.

264
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,149
It was the first time.

265
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:28,942
I don't know what got into me.

266
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,362
Next time, you'll go to court.

267
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:34,573
Let me have your address.

268
00:59:34,656 --> 00:59:37,909
12 rue des Pyrénées,
in the 20th arrondissement.

269
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:40,871
Now get lost.

270
00:59:53,467 --> 00:59:55,510
I knew I would succeed.

271
00:59:59,139 --> 01:00:01,433
To think that
you didn't believe in me.

272
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:05,937
Now you have your lovely face.

273
01:00:07,606 --> 01:00:09,441
Your real face.

274
01:00:11,443 --> 01:00:13,695
You can start life over again.

275
01:00:15,322 --> 01:00:16,823
True.

276
01:00:17,324 --> 01:00:20,494
But I also have to come back
to life for others.

277
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,621
How can I?

278
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:27,292
You can start by taking a trip,
a long trip.

279
01:00:29,127 --> 01:00:31,254
I'll get you new papers.

280
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:34,549
You can choose yourself a name.

281
01:00:36,051 --> 01:00:38,053
Won't that be fun?

282
01:00:38,136 --> 01:00:40,055
A new face,

283
01:00:40,597 --> 01:00:42,682
a new identity.

284
01:00:42,766 --> 01:00:45,727
You're more beautiful than ever.

285
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:50,148
There's something angelic
about you now.

286
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:55,487
Angelic?
I don't know about that.

287
01:00:57,447 --> 01:00:59,741
When I look in a mirror,

288
01:00:59,825 --> 01:01:02,828
I feel I'm looking at someone
who looks like me,

289
01:01:03,995 --> 01:01:06,998
but seems to come from the Beyond,

290
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:09,501
from the Beyond.

291
01:01:10,377 --> 01:01:12,212
What about Jacques?

292
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,846
Obviously, that does pose a problem.

293
01:01:22,681 --> 01:01:24,349
I'll explain it to him.

294
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,520
He loves you so much.

295
01:01:31,189 --> 01:01:33,024
He'll be very happy.

296
01:01:35,235 --> 01:01:36,653
Smile.

297
01:01:37,612 --> 01:01:39,155
Smile.

298
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,200
Not too much.

299
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,723
Give him a shot of Pentothal.
I'll be right down.

300
01:02:08,685 --> 01:02:10,228
Another emergency.

301
01:02:13,023 --> 01:02:15,942
Will you come with me?
Sorry, darling.

302
01:02:38,423 --> 01:02:40,592
You're not wearing makeup, I hope?

303
01:02:44,012 --> 01:02:45,055
Why?

304
01:02:47,223 --> 01:02:49,100
No reason.

305
01:02:49,893 --> 01:02:52,854
You have rosy cheeks, that's all.

306
01:02:55,273 --> 01:02:57,192
See you tomorrow, darling.

307
01:03:03,573 --> 01:03:07,160
I won't be long.
I'll come up to say good night.

308
01:03:18,254 --> 01:03:20,382
You looked anxious examining her.

309
01:03:20,465 --> 01:03:23,843
You're imagining things.

310
01:03:25,971 --> 01:03:27,555
Why are you lying?

311
01:03:28,306 --> 01:03:31,393
I've known you long enough
to read your face.

312
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,561
Tell me the truth.

313
01:03:37,482 --> 01:03:38,984
I've failed.

314
01:03:53,832 --> 01:03:55,542
<i>February 15.</i>

315
01:03:56,751 --> 01:03:58,336
<i>February 20.</i>

316
01:03:59,671 --> 01:04:04,551
<i>A week after healing,
spots of pigmentation appear.</i>

317
01:04:06,011 --> 01:04:12,017
<i>Later, palpation reveals
small subcutaneous nodules.</i>

318
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:19,649
<i>On Day 12, necrosis
of the graft tissue is apparent.</i>

319
01:04:21,192 --> 01:04:23,069
<i>Day 20...</i>

320
01:04:24,029 --> 01:04:30,326
<i>The first ulcerations and signs
of rejection of the graft tissue.</i>

321
01:04:31,202 --> 01:04:34,664
<i>The necrotic graft tissue
must be removed.</i>

322
01:05:09,407 --> 01:05:13,953
With any old dog,
everything's possible.

323
01:05:16,748 --> 01:05:21,544
I'll have to settle
for this beastliness.

324
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:18,143
I'm listening.

325
01:06:20,228 --> 01:06:22,063
Say something.

326
01:06:22,147 --> 01:06:23,731
This is infuriating!

327
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,401
Say something!

328
01:06:28,403 --> 01:06:29,779
Jacques.

329
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:44,127
Are you mad?
Who were you calling?

330
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,503
No one.

331
01:06:46,045 --> 01:06:48,339
Do you realize
how reckless you're being?

332
01:06:49,257 --> 01:06:52,135
I know.
The dead should keep quiet.

333
01:06:52,218 --> 01:06:54,846
Then let me be dead for good.

334
01:06:55,388 --> 01:06:57,348
I can't stand it anymore!

335
01:06:57,932 --> 01:07:00,101
I don't dare look at myself.

336
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,021
I can't touch my face

337
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:07,901
for fear of feeling the furrows
and crevices in my skin.

338
01:07:07,984 --> 01:07:10,528
It feels like rubber!

339
01:07:12,989 --> 01:07:16,951
Calm down, my dear.
Trust in him.

340
01:07:17,035 --> 01:07:19,454
I'm sure he'll succeed.

341
01:07:19,537 --> 01:07:21,956
He never will.

342
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,751
He'll keep experimenting on me
like one of his dogs.

343
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:28,004
A human guinea pig.
What a godsend for him!

344
01:07:28,713 --> 01:07:30,506
You have no right to say that.

345
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:34,260
I want to die... please!

346
01:07:34,928 --> 01:07:39,766
There are those injections he gives
the dogs when things go wrong!

347
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:43,645
Stop talking like that!

348
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:48,900
You have to kill me.
I can't stand it anymore!

349
01:07:56,532 --> 01:07:58,701
Come up, quickly!

350
01:07:59,994 --> 01:08:02,664
I'm sure of it.
I heard Christiane's voice.

351
01:08:02,747 --> 01:08:06,167
You thought you did.
Over the phone.

352
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,836
Did you mention it
to Professor Génessier?

353
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,590
Of course. But he insists
he identified his daughter's body.

354
01:08:12,674 --> 01:08:14,717
I know. I was there.

355
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,053
What can I say?

356
01:08:17,595 --> 01:08:19,931
Maybe it was a practical joke.

357
01:08:21,099 --> 01:08:22,350
Still...

358
01:08:22,433 --> 01:08:25,520
Well, Doctor, I deal in facts.

359
01:08:26,187 --> 01:08:28,815
These files are filled
with testimonies.

360
01:08:28,898 --> 01:08:32,318
“I think that...”
“My feeling is that...”

361
01:08:33,069 --> 01:08:34,612
A lot of vague descriptions.

362
01:08:34,696 --> 01:08:37,448
Here: The red taxi picking up a girl.

363
01:08:38,032 --> 01:08:41,202
The handsome woman
with a pearl choker

364
01:08:41,286 --> 01:08:43,496
who was seen with the other girl.

365
01:08:44,831 --> 01:08:46,958
A pearl choker?

366
01:08:49,836 --> 01:08:51,963
That ring a bell?

367
01:08:52,046 --> 01:08:53,798
Hold on.

368
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:58,136
Yes, it reminds me of someone.

369
01:09:31,878 --> 01:09:34,756
But the other day you said
I was off the hook.

370
01:09:35,256 --> 01:09:38,343
I hoped so, Miss Paulette Mérodon,

371
01:09:38,926 --> 01:09:41,429
but the case went higher up.

372
01:09:42,055 --> 01:09:44,182
They say I was too easy on you.

373
01:09:46,517 --> 01:09:49,645
So that means I'm done for.

374
01:09:50,938 --> 01:09:54,150
Does that mean prison?
- There's the trial first.

375
01:09:54,984 --> 01:09:56,736
The trial!

376
01:09:59,322 --> 01:10:01,824
My parents will never get over it.

377
01:10:03,534 --> 01:10:05,411
I've been thinking.

378
01:10:06,162 --> 01:10:09,248
There may be a way to avoid all this.

379
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:14,253
Obviously, it would involve
a great deal of discretion.

380
01:10:15,129 --> 01:10:16,798
And some intelligence.

381
01:10:16,881 --> 01:10:18,800
I can be very discreet.

382
01:10:18,883 --> 01:10:20,927
And as for intelligence...

383
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:23,096
if it's not too complicated.

384
01:10:23,179 --> 01:10:24,639
You'll see.

385
01:10:24,722 --> 01:10:27,392
You just have to do us
a little favor.

386
01:10:27,475 --> 01:10:32,063
- What do I have to do?
- Bleach your hair, for starters.

387
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:35,733
- You're kidding.
- That's not our style.

388
01:10:36,651 --> 01:10:39,404
You have to be much blonder.

389
01:10:39,987 --> 01:10:42,323
- It won't suit me.
- It doesn't matter.

390
01:10:42,407 --> 01:10:46,702
Then a doctor will have you
admitted to a clinic.

391
01:10:46,786 --> 01:10:49,580
- But I'm not sick!
- You'll say you are.

392
01:10:50,456 --> 01:10:53,084
Brief her on the details.

393
01:10:53,793 --> 01:10:56,963
At the clinic,
you'll complain of migraines.

394
01:10:57,046 --> 01:10:58,923
I'll write it all down.

395
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:02,218
I'll give you a note for Dr. Gleize.

396
01:11:06,097 --> 01:11:08,933
He'll give you a letter
for Dr. Génessier.

397
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:12,437
Speaking.

398
01:11:16,983 --> 01:11:18,609
What's that?

399
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:21,112
Wait, I'll write it down.

400
01:11:28,703 --> 01:11:31,289
She can be admitted
tomorrow morning.

401
01:11:33,332 --> 01:11:36,169
Don't worry.
I'll keep an eye on her.

402
01:11:36,252 --> 01:11:39,172
Sure, it's just to check out a hunch.

403
01:11:42,091 --> 01:11:46,012
If anything happens,
I'll let you know immediately.

404
01:12:04,614 --> 01:12:06,073
You're coming along fine.

405
01:12:06,157 --> 01:12:07,783
Just fine, Doctor.

406
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:18,169
The young lady
was admitted this morning.

407
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:20,338
- The attending physician?
- Dr. Gleize.

408
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:23,007
Here's his letter.

409
01:12:29,472 --> 01:12:30,973
You're in great pain?

410
01:12:32,808 --> 01:12:34,268
Yes.

411
01:12:34,352 --> 01:12:36,646
At times.

412
01:12:39,649 --> 01:12:44,820
Do a funduscopy
and an electroencephalogram today.

413
01:12:47,865 --> 01:12:49,534
Are you going to shave my head?

414
01:12:51,577 --> 01:12:53,663
I hope not, anyway.

415
01:12:53,746 --> 01:12:55,540
That would be a shame.

416
01:13:02,964 --> 01:13:07,843
An e...lectro...encephalogram...

417
01:13:25,778 --> 01:13:27,405
Don't be afraid.

418
01:13:28,114 --> 01:13:30,074
We're friends.

419
01:13:30,783 --> 01:13:32,785
Don't touch your forehead.

420
01:13:35,955 --> 01:13:38,249
Tell me how many fingers
I'm holding up.

421
01:13:53,264 --> 01:13:54,515
Three.

422
01:13:58,853 --> 01:14:01,355
And now... how many?

423
01:14:03,691 --> 01:14:04,775
Three.

424
01:14:06,611 --> 01:14:09,071
No... two.

425
01:14:40,019 --> 01:14:42,688
What do you think, Doctor?

426
01:14:42,772 --> 01:14:44,357
I'm hopeful.

427
01:14:46,776 --> 01:14:48,736
Tell me, Doctor.

428
01:14:49,987 --> 01:14:51,322
Can you save him?

429
01:14:51,405 --> 01:14:52,990
Of course we can.

430
01:14:54,075 --> 01:14:55,660
Trust me.

431
01:15:01,707 --> 01:15:03,626
Your prognosis?

432
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:05,336
And yours?

433
01:15:06,337 --> 01:15:07,922
We agree.

434
01:15:14,887 --> 01:15:16,514
Close your eyes.

435
01:15:18,683 --> 01:15:20,476
Open your eyes.

436
01:15:33,406 --> 01:15:35,866
That's it.
You can open your eyes.

437
01:15:39,912 --> 01:15:43,374
You'll feel a slight electric shock.
It won't hurt.

438
01:15:44,917 --> 01:15:46,544
Don't move.

439
01:15:58,097 --> 01:15:59,223
Close.

440
01:16:03,436 --> 01:16:04,895
Continue.

441
01:16:08,941 --> 01:16:10,568
Open your eyes.

442
01:16:11,569 --> 01:16:13,195
Close them.

443
01:16:36,802 --> 01:16:39,597
Bring me the chart
as soon as you've finished.

444
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:54,945
Nothing seems to be wrong
with this Paulette Mérodon girl.

445
01:17:09,418 --> 01:17:12,004
Bed 15 is hemorrhaging, sir.

446
01:17:12,755 --> 01:17:14,799
Take care of it, Jacques.

447
01:17:56,382 --> 01:17:58,175
Here's the chart, sir.

448
01:18:02,888 --> 01:18:05,683
No abnormalities.

449
01:18:06,559 --> 01:18:08,727
Release her tonight.

450
01:18:08,811 --> 01:18:10,729
It will free up a bed.

451
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,233
We may have an emergency tonight.

452
01:18:37,256 --> 01:18:40,759
- Do I give this form to you?
- That's right.

453
01:18:40,843 --> 01:18:43,596
- May I make a call?
- To Paris?

454
01:18:44,346 --> 01:18:47,391
What number?
- 4284.

455
01:18:58,444 --> 01:19:00,946
Mom? It's Paulette.

456
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:03,490
Everything's fine.
I'm coming home.

457
01:19:03,574 --> 01:19:05,075
See you in a bit.

458
01:19:05,993 --> 01:19:07,995
What do I owe you?
- There's no charge.

459
01:19:08,579 --> 01:19:10,956
How can I get back to Paris?

460
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:15,294
By bus. Turn left as you leave.
It's a 15-minute walk.

461
01:19:42,905 --> 01:19:47,034
Can I give you a lift, miss?
I'm going your way.

462
01:19:47,117 --> 01:19:48,702
With pleasure, madame.

463
01:20:02,841 --> 01:20:04,468
Inspector Parot?

464
01:20:05,177 --> 01:20:07,137
It's Jacques Vernon.

465
01:20:09,431 --> 01:20:10,975
What's that, Doctor?

466
01:20:11,642 --> 01:20:13,477
She left already?

467
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,813
They don't drag
their feet at your clinic.

468
01:20:16,814 --> 01:20:19,108
They sure don't keep them locked up.

469
01:20:22,027 --> 01:20:23,821
What did I tell you?

470
01:20:24,363 --> 01:20:27,324
But we'll check to make sure
she got home safely.

471
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,994
Thanks for letting us know.

472
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,097
There are two men
asking for you at the clinic.

473
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:52,850
You know I don't have time.

474
01:20:53,058 --> 01:20:54,935
Tell them to come back tomorrow.

475
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:27,861
Sorry to disturb you at this hour.

476
01:22:27,945 --> 01:22:33,450
We want to know if Miss Paulette
Mérodon checked out earlier.

477
01:22:34,618 --> 01:22:36,620
How did you know
she was checking out?

478
01:22:37,371 --> 01:22:40,958
She called home to say
she was on her way.

479
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:44,378
She never arrived.

480
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:46,713
So we came down to check.

481
01:22:48,465 --> 01:22:50,384
Easy enough.

482
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:54,221
I gave the order to release the patient.

483
01:22:55,973 --> 01:23:00,227
Has Paulette Mérodon been released?
- I'll see.

484
01:23:03,438 --> 01:23:07,901
So, interested
in this young lady, are you?

485
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,822
She's mixed up in a case we're on.

486
01:23:12,531 --> 01:23:14,783
We wanted to talk to her tonight.

487
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,580
I have a feeling that you're a little late.

488
01:23:19,663 --> 01:23:22,082
Paulette Mérodon. Here it is.

489
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:28,172
I remember now: a girl with blue eyes.
She made a call from here.

490
01:23:28,255 --> 01:23:30,674
I told her where she could
catch the bus.

491
01:23:32,259 --> 01:23:33,844
You see?

492
01:23:34,595 --> 01:23:36,180
I'm sorry,

493
01:23:37,097 --> 01:23:38,932
but once they walk
through those doors,

494
01:23:39,016 --> 01:23:41,435
my patients are no longer
my responsibility.

495
01:23:42,186 --> 01:23:44,479
I understand.

496
01:23:45,355 --> 01:23:48,275
Again, sorry to disturb you.

497
01:23:49,193 --> 01:23:51,111
Don't mention it.

498
01:23:59,828 --> 01:24:02,372
Well, good night, Professor.

499
01:24:03,999 --> 01:24:08,420
Since you're leaving, Jacques,
please show these gentlemen out.

500
01:24:35,614 --> 01:24:37,824
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

501
01:24:37,908 --> 01:24:40,410
It's nothing.

502
01:24:40,494 --> 01:24:43,121
We're used to following up bum leads.

503
01:24:44,539 --> 01:24:48,043
And I put myself in your place.
You start getting ideas...

504
01:24:49,753 --> 01:24:52,381
It's all these coincidences.

505
01:24:52,464 --> 01:24:54,508
I wanted to put my mind at ease.

506
01:24:54,591 --> 01:24:57,052
So we've put our mind at ease.

507
01:24:57,636 --> 01:25:00,013
As for your heart,

508
01:25:00,097 --> 01:25:04,851
I'm sure things will work out
for you on that end.

509
01:25:05,769 --> 01:25:08,063
You're young, Doctor.

510
01:25:08,146 --> 01:25:10,315
You have your life ahead of you.

511
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:30,145
Put that down!

512
01:26:41,573 --> 01:26:43,033
Why?
