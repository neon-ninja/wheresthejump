- Big storm tonight.

00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,841
Don't mean to pry,
      but I can't imagine

10
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:18,143

    wants to do at the lots.

-<i> You made it?</i>

22
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,691
- Yup.

-<i> Storm coming tonight.</i>

24
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,128
- Yeah, I heard.
      Can you put her on?

25
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,100
-<i> Julia...she's asleep.</i>
         - Please, mom.

26
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,335
Can you please call her over
  so I can tell her goodnight?

27
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,438
-<i> Julia, don't think</i>
      <i> about her tonight.</i>

28
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,074
- Well, if she wakes up,
  can you just please tell her
         that I called?

29
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,075
-<i> Okay.</i>

30
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,912

34
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,720
- Yeah, I know that, mom.

35
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:12,057
-<i> Remember your</i>
     <i> breathing exercises.</i>
            - Yeah.

-<i> I don't know how many more</i>
   <i> opportunities you'll get.</i>

37
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,695
- Yeah. Yeah, okay, mom.
          I gotta go.

38
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,729
Alright, bye.

39
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,077
[doorbell buzzing]

40
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:39,818
- You're a student, correct?
          - Yes, sir.

41
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
I'm gonna become
        a nurse someday.

42
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,822
- Best of luck with all that.

43
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,728
Around here, you work
      in the night shift.

44
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,296
<i> 2 guards man every shift.</i>

45
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,132
1 guard on patrol duty,
   the other on the screens.

46
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:59,104
- Wow. What is this place?

47
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,707
- The building was erected
      during the big boom.

48
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,976
Assumption being
    industry drives growth.

49
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:07,045
Growth brings up demand for more
   affordable luxury housing.

50
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:20,993
Imagine living in a place
 providing everything you need

51
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:23,028
for a comfortable life.

52
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,230
You'd never have to leave.

53
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:31,136
And as you know, boom became
     bust, and here we are.

54
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,474
- What a waste.

55
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,910
- You have to be careful here,
         Ms. Streak.

56
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:42,381
Things are starting to...
          fall apart.

57
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,323
Ballroom, grand hall, gym

58
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,025
mail and storage rooms

59
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:56,728
plus a residential tower,
        30 floors high.

60
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,798
As a patrol guard,
  you make sure nobody gets in

61
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,467
nobody vandalizes the place,
      nothing bad happens

62
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,437
to the structure...
  and nobody steals anything.

63
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,372
-<i> Does that happen?</i>
        -<i> All the time.</i>

64
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,308
Steal whatever they can
      get their hands on.

65
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,310
We've been having issues
  of vagrancy, tryin' to make

66
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,012
<i> the place into a squat,</i>
    <i> so don't let anyone in.</i>

67
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,348
This job pays well for a reason.

68
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,118
The nights here
    can be long...and dark.

69
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,822
Some of the lights are on timer,
    so they turn off to save
           on power.

70
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,359
The combination
 can make some people...uneasy.

71
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,329
- I like the night.

72
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,931
- We've blanketed the entire
 building with security cameras

73
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,833
so we only need two guards.

74
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,768
One on patrol and the other..

75
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,171
- In front of the screens.
            Got it.

76
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,306
Where's the control room?

77
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:42,674
- Upstairs.

78
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,817
I see your partner's
         already here.

79
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,253
This is Dennis Cooper.

80
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,823
He's been here since day one.

81
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,460
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

82
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:04,196
I'm Julia, but everybody
        calls me Streak.

83
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,198
- That's great.

84
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,204
- Nice.

85
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,306
<i> Cooper will take you</i>
     <i> through the controls.</i>

86
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:16,174
But I think you'll find
  the system pretty intuitive

87
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,744
once you start using it.

88
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,879
You'll go on patrol
     once every two hours.

89
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,115
Cooper will communicate with you

90
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:25,250
using this headset.

91
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:28,086
Packs a small camera
       and a microphone.

92
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,323
Show us the feed, Cooper.

93
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,125
[keyboard keys clacking]

94
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,896
Simple enough?

95
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,866
Also, we've been having trouble
       with electricity.

96
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,567
We lose a video feed
       from time to time

97
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,270
so you'll have to throw
           a breaker.

98
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,571
- Got it.

99
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,808
-<i> You know what a breaker is?</i>
            - Yup.

100
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,043
- Don't forget the uniform.

101
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,312
That is the most important part
         of this job.

102
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,183
- Have a great night.

103
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,318
- There is a locker room
   in the back, to the right

104
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,687
if you wanna change there.

105
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:07,125
Unless you feel more comfortable
    changing in here, which

106
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:11,263
I could probably make
an exception for that...tonight.

107
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,632
- I'm gonna go
      to the locker room.

108
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,634
- Okay.

109
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,506
[door closes]

110
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,446

[thunder rumbling]

112
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,538
- This place is really big.

113
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:32,043
A person could spend
      a lifetime in here.

114
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,579
- Well, most people don't last
      more than a week.

115
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,290
- What's your story?

116
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,226
- What's my story?

117
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,696
My story. Um, let me see.

118
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,498
It's a very long, detailed

119
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,002
richly...boring tale.

120
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,738
However, let's start
    with tonight's chapter.

121
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,474
I guess it starts out

122
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,377
that I'm sick and tired of Dixon

123
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,046
wheeling in some..

124
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,915
...local community college brat

125
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,984
<i> and expecting me to entertain</i>
        <i> them all night.</i>

126
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,921
That's my story.

127
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:20,392
'Cause tomorrow or the next day
  or possibly a week from now

128
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,961
but without question, it's going
 to happen, you're gonna decide

129
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,864
that patrolling a big,
 empty building every two hours

130
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,432
is not what was meant for you

131
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,801
and your life
      and big aspirations.

132
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,736
You're then gonna quit.

133
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,339
Then Dixon's gonna bring in
  someone who's just like you

134
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,874
and gonna sit
      right in that chair

135
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,208
I'm gonna have
     the same conversation

136
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,412
and be forced to babysit
     that person all night.

137
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,780
- Really?

138
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,648
- No tips, either.

139
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,350
- This is gonna be
         a long night.

140
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,352
- You have no idea.

141
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,422
Sorry, sweetheart.

142
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,258
Welcome to the big world
          of security.

143
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:57,162
Excuse me. Time to lock up.

144
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,166
Lights out.

145
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:05,303
2, 3, 4. Ta-da.

[clears throat]

149
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,260
- Gross.

150
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:35,000
- It's weird. That happens
   every time I try to burp.

151
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,508
What are you, 24?

152
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,179
25? 23?

153
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,885
Alright, we're just
   gonna stick with 24 then.

154
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,754
- What, are you
       talking to me now?

155
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,756
- Tough. Right?

156
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,026
<i> Bet you were a good student.</i>

157
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,028
Little teacher's pet.

158
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,931
Am I right?

159
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,369
Fit. Like your arms.

160
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,739
<i> You do a little</i>
      <i> self-defense maybe?</i>

161
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,276
Little karate?

162
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,712
Little, uh, tae kwon do?

163
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:24,282
Judo? Jiujitsu?
       Jell-O wrestling?

164
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,352
Pillow fights?

165
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:28,987
[exhales heavily]

166
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,657
Kickboxing, maybe?

167
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,792
- Yeah.

168
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,795
Yeah, I do kickboxing.

169
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:41,166
Yup. You have to for this job.

170
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,835
- Ho-ho. Yeah?
           -<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

171
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:46,037

685
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:01,937
Is that why?
    - You don't understand.

686
00:54:01,939 --> 00:54:03,839
I have seen some things
      down there, Cooper.

687
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:06,675
I have seen things down there.
    - You're gonna sit down.

688
00:54:06,677 --> 00:54:07,910
You're not going anywhere.
           - Why not?

689
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:10,379
- Because you're delusional,
          that's why.

690
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:12,348
You've done enough tonight.

691
00:54:13,718 --> 00:54:16,185
- Cooper, I --
     - I'm not letting you
          out of here.

692
00:54:16,187 --> 00:54:20,823
- Why?
      - Because you're not
        thinking right.

693
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:22,291
Because you put me in jeopardy.

694
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:24,827
Because I need this job.

695
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:27,529
I don't have anywhere else
             to go!

696
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:29,732
You can take your pill
    and go fool someone else

697
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:31,300
like you fooled me!

698
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:33,369
I can't.

701
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:44,713
- I'm so sorry.
          - Don't be.

702
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,715
I don't need your pity.

Are you<i> fucking</i> kidding me?

704
00:54:57,928 --> 00:55:00,896
- They won't leave us alone
unless we shut the door, Cooper.

705
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:03,098
- Or what,
     you're gonna stun me?

706
00:55:04,235 --> 00:55:06,869
- I'm gonna do it.
         - Put it down.

707
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:08,904
You're not gonna do it.

708
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:10,572
No, you're not,
 because it's just gonna prove

709
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:12,875
that you're crazy and you're
     gonna lose everything.

710
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:17,446
- Please, Cooper,
    I'm begging you. Please.

711
00:55:20,685 --> 00:55:22,318
- I'll go down.

712
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:25,387
I'll go down
    and I'll shut the door.

713
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:27,690

Cooper, no! Don't leave me

     - That's a good idea.
