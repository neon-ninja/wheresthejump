1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,961
-

2
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:09,177
'I am she that liveth and was dead..

3
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:12,681
... and behold, I am alive forever more...

4
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:16,268
... and have the keys of hell and death.'

5
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,960
'Dear Elizabeth..

6
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:28,755
... I suggest you come out here as soon as possible.

7
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,967
I've tried to sort things out, but I don't think I'm getting anywhere.

8
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,345
This pace is unbelievable..

9
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:40,141
... there's no electricity. and none of the comforts of 20th century living.

10
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:42,894
You shoud see the brown sack they make me wear...

11
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:47,690
The height of fashion for auto-flaggelating creeps and crimson saints alike

12
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,359
... I can assure you!

13
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:53,029
I tell you l'l never complain about London again.

14
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:54,864
See you soon. Theresa.

15
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:58,701
... your friend from the land before time.'

16
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:56,660
No, not tonight

17
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:01,123
I'm not crossing in this weather

18
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:15,137
A deal?

19
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,186
What's the hurry?

20
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,690
That island has been there a very long time.

21
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:30,903
.. and it ain't going to disappear now...

22
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:32,905
I'll tell you what...

23
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:36,367
... go to that dump across the road.

24
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:38,118
... hire yourself a room...

25
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:40,329
... and next week...

26
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,874
... I'll take you to the island.

27
00:18:49,547 --> 00:18:52,508
I need to reach the convent tonight..

28
00:18:57,555 --> 00:19:01,642
Are you afraid of death, lady?

29
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,727
I am!

30
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:06,730
My say is no!

31
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:10,109
Come back next week.

32
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,487
Come back next week!

33
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:16,115
I'll take you for free.

34
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:54,987
I'm not afraid.

35
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,489
Sorry?

36
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:02,161
Death. I'm not scared of death

37
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:05,539
- I'll take you.. - Tonight?

38
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,251
Tonight, now

39
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,092
It's money up front..

40
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:25,225
If we go down tonight...

41
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:30,356
... I want the fish to eat it out of my pocket

42
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:34,944
When they've finished feasting on my eyeballs.

43
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,152
- Can you give me a hand, please? - You won't drown.

44
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:22,658
If you fall there, you'll be crushed to death.

45
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,430
Oh my God!

46
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:52,623
Don't mind him...

47
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,252
... he keeps the other freaks away.

48
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,545
Candles...

49
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,924
In London they don't even have them in churches any more.

50
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:10,010
Nowadays that's all electric lightbulbs...

51
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:13,764
... put a coin in, press a button and pronto, up it flashes...

52
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:15,974
... salvation guaranteed!

53
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:20,062
woud like to go to your country, one day.

54
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,898
Engand?

55
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,317
Why?

56
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:29,154
You'd hate it. Sarah.

57
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,496
- Cigarette? - No, thank you..

58
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,749
I wouldn't know where to start..

59
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:55,430
What a beautiful woman..

60
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:59,226
- Who is it? - My mother.

61
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:04,606
She came from this island.

62
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,775
Is she living in London now?

63
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,278
She died giving birth to me.

64
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:13,115
- Sorry,  didn't mean to... - Don't worry, it's not your fault.

65
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,661
I'm sorry, truly..

66
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:25,419
That the only photo I have of her

67
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:29,464
My father spent his whole life trying to forget about this island..

68
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,552
... and my mother.

69
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:39,766
Mother Superior will see you in half an hour.

70
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:43,729
I better get ready.

71
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:29,251
We didn't think you would make it tonight.

72
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,712
I like to keep my appointments.

73
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:35,090
Commendable.

74
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:39,261
... but now, what can I do to make your stay in our humble home.

75
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:42,556
... a pleasant and fruitful one?

76
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:47,060
As you know, my father died last October...

77
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:49,062
... and left me everything...

78
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:54,359
... and that incudes a commitment on my part to continue with the regular payments..

79
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:57,571
... my father made to this convent for the past 20
years.

80
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:00,282
I didn't know anything about it.

81
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,661
... his was very secretive about his sudden conversion to religion.

82
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:19,259
Sometimes secrecy is a blessing..

83
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:22,846
We are a very secretive order, Elizabeth.

84
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:26,224
... we don't allow the corruption of the outside world...

85
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:29,811
.. to divert us from our divine purpose.

86
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:33,482
But doesn't money count as a corrupting factor?

87
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:41,406
There is such a thing as a necessary evil, my child.

88
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:46,453
... unfortunately, there are things which are not solved by prayer alone.

89
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,914
I appreciate that..

90
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:51,082
but  hope you won't begrudge me the right..

91
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:54,336
... to know why  should carry on with these payments..

92
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,448
They serve a purpose. Elizabeth..

93
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:28,078
... your father understood that, and I trust you too, in time.

94
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:33,124
In the mean time.  will do all I can to help you.

95
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:38,547
Our library, our ceremonies, you have access to it all.

96
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:41,758
And Sarah is a good girl...

97
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:44,636
... she'll make a willing assistant.

98
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,265
Thank you...

99
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:09,244
Excuse me, what's going on here?

100
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,084
Convent rule.

101
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:20,630
You're allowed anything, but what they provide for you...

102
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:30,223
You'll get your stuff back when you leave, of course...

103
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:40,275
This is for you.. from your friend, Theresa...

104
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,403
She had to leave in a hurry..

105
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:45,905
Theresa left? When?

106
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:48,366
Two days ago...

107
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:51,453
I don't understand...

108
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:54,664
She had some business to attend to in London.

109
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,959
Business in London? What's going on, Sarah?

110
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:01,087
I'm as in the dark as you are..

111
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,299
Of course, look, I'm sorry.

112
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:07,636
I think we both better try and catch up on some sleep now

113
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:10,430
Al right, see you tomorrow.

114
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:12,891
Oh, Sarah..

115
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:14,893
... thanks for everything.

116
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:11,212
Did you bring Theresa here?

117
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:14,883
No, not everyone has access to the library...

118
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,261
.. and from the look of the place. I'd say...

119
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:20,930
... you're the first to visit in ages.

120
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:29,230
I have to go now...

121
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,443
If you need me, I'll be in my room...

122
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:35,046
'The beast that thou sawest was and is not

123
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,423
... and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder..

124
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:42,303
... when they behold the beast that was. and is not, and yet is.

125
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:45,473
And they shall make an image of the beast...

126
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,396
... for the whole of the image shall make the beast ascend out of the bottomless pit...

127
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,441
... and power shall be given unto the beast

128
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:59,237
And all, both small and great, rich and poor.

129
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:02,657
... free and bond, that sawest the true face of the beast.

130
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:06,703
. shall receive a mark, the mark of blindness.

131
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:09,580
... that is, and yet is not.

132
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:13,459
For those who are blind shall see the true face of the beast.

133
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:16,921
... and forever suffer it in their soul

134
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,091
The beast shall say unto the world...

135
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:24,595
... 'l am Apha and Omega, the first and the last.

136
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:28,099
... I am she that liveth, and was dead...

137
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:31,436
... and behold, I'm alive forever more...

138
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:34,981
... and have the keys of hell and death.'

139
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

140
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

141
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,764
Calm down, it's me, Sarah!

142
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:20,558
They killed her, Sarah. they killed her.

143
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:24,729
- Who are they? - The nuns, they killed Theresa!

144
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,190
We better move. Follow me.

145
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:33,821
Did you see where they took the body?

146
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,158
No.  I lost them. Why. Sarah?.

147
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:40,077
Why would they do somethng like that?

148
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:44,498
I don't know... I don't know...

149
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:49,712
You're probably involved too... you probably helped them...

150
00:43:50,046 --> 00:43:51,922
I swear, I'm as shocked as you are, Elizabeth...

151
00:43:52,048 --> 00:43:55,509
Why should I beieve you? You're one of them, Sarah...

152
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:59,347
You shoud believe me, because right now I'm the only thing you've got..

153
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,516
... and because I saved you up there...

154
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:10,649
Are you sure it was Theresa?

155
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,737
I saw them carrying the body..

156
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:17,156
... and that awful painting!

157
00:44:17,323 --> 00:44:19,700
I know they killed her...

158
00:44:20,076 --> 00:44:23,204
We should do something... we should call the police.

159
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:27,416
There's no police on the island.

160
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:32,046
... and the boat for the mainland doesn't sail until next wveek.

161
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,676
We're left to our own devices...

162
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:39,804
What can we do?

163
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:43,140
Is there no way of communicating with the mainland?

164
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:45,434
No, just the boat...

165
00:44:47,103 --> 00:44:51,107
Look, we've got to find out what's going on..

166
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:54,985
... and maybe, I know exactly where to start...

167
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:57,738
- Come with me.. - Sarah...

168
00:44:58,781 --> 00:45:00,741
Why are you doing this?

169
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:02,910
Why are you heping me?

170
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,166
I'm doing it because I like you.

171
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,463
When I was a child, someone used to smuggle Sherlock Holmes books.

172
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,382
... from the mainand.

173
00:45:16,799 --> 00:45:19,510
Now's my chance to pay amateur detective.

174
00:45:20,094 --> 00:45:22,096
Satisfied?

175
00:45:22,263 --> 00:45:25,933
- Can we go now? - This is not a game, Sarah!

176
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:28,394
We could get killed!

177
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:30,479
If your theory is right..

178
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:33,607
... there s a good chance we're going to get killed anyway.

179
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:37,528
... so we might as well try to find out why.

180
00:45:48,205 --> 00:45:50,875
It's full of his old paintings..

181
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:54,795
I thought we could find some clues...

182
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:57,965
How did you find this place?

183
00:45:58,132 --> 00:46:01,552
I told you... Sherlock Holmes, remember?

184
00:46:08,017 --> 00:46:09,977
What do you know about the painter?

185
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,021
Not very much...

186
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:15,316
... I'm not even supposed to know he exists.

187
00:46:15,858 --> 00:46:19,111
Only a handful of nuns have access to his quarters...

188
00:46:19,195 --> 00:46:22,198
... all the others don't even know he's there.

189
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:26,827
I suppose it was your affinity with Sherlock Homes.

190
00:46:26,994 --> 00:46:29,580
.. that allowed you to unravel the mystery.

191
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:31,916
Absolutely right...

192
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:35,377
My guess is they used the painter as a sort of oracle.

193
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:37,171
An orace?

194
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:38,964
You mean, all these paintings are real?

195
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:42,927
You've seen the paintng of Theresa. How do you suppose he knew?

196
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:45,262
He never leaves the pit..

197
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:49,058
and even if he did, how's he supposed to have seen her?

198
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:59,360
Look at the little girl. She was in another paintng I saw in the painter's pit.

199
00:46:59,777 --> 00:47:01,946
Any idea who she is?

200
00:47:02,488 --> 00:47:04,156
No...

201
00:47:04,615 --> 00:47:08,786
I don't know, it's like I shoud know who she is...

202
00:47:09,036 --> 00:47:11,038
... who they both are...

203
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:17,795
Does the amulet they carry mean anything to you?

204
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:29,890
We need more light..

205
00:47:30,057 --> 00:47:33,102
You stay here I'll go to get more lamps...

206
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:35,104
We should stay together!

207
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:37,523
I won't be long.

208
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,150
Oh, shit...

209
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:05,361
Eizabeth... what happened?

210
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:08,155
They tried to kill me, Sarah...

211
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:24,880
I can't stay here...

212
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:28,008
Where else can you go?

213
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:30,678
I don't know...

214
00:49:32,304 --> 00:49:34,431
... the village...

215
00:49:35,808 --> 00:49:37,935
Nobody will let you in.

216
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:40,979
Listen to me...

217
00:49:41,105 --> 00:49:43,565
... you're a lot safer here tonight...

218
00:49:44,441 --> 00:49:48,404
You need to rest. I'll stay with you

219
00:49:54,785 --> 00:49:58,038
When I was a child I was scared of nuns...

220
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:01,083
... they gave me the creeps.

221
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,504
I suppose wvhat's happening just proves your fear was justifed.

222
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:07,965
Yeah,  suppose it does..

223
00:50:10,426 --> 00:50:14,430
It's funny, but that's almost all I remember from my childhood...

224
00:50:15,472 --> 00:50:19,143
It's like the first seven years have been erased from my memory...

225
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:23,397
My father always tried to keep me in the dark about my past...

226
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:27,693
He didn't even have a photograph of me before my seventh birthday..

227
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:30,654
... my first English birthday..

228
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:34,032
What do you mean, your first "'English birthday'?

229
00:50:35,701 --> 00:50:39,705
I wasn't born there.. I was born on this island, Sarah...

230
00:50:40,998 --> 00:50:44,460
This is where I spent the first seven years of my life...

231
00:50:45,294 --> 00:50:47,463
I didn't know anything about it.

232
00:50:48,297 --> 00:50:51,258
My father told me just before he died...

233
00:50:51,383 --> 00:50:53,969
... and then he made me promise never to come here.

234
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:57,431
Now I wish I'd kept that promise..

235
00:50:59,475 --> 00:51:01,935
But you had to come, Eizabeth...

236
00:51:03,395 --> 00:51:05,481
Maybe...

237
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:08,776
... maybe I had to come.

238
00:51:08,942 --> 00:51:10,569
Look...

239
00:51:10,778 --> 00:51:13,322
... why don't you try and sleep, now?

240
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:17,826
The door is locked and l'll stay with you tonight.

241
00:51:18,577 --> 00:51:20,329
Thank you...

242
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:23,329
-

243
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:26,331
-

244
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,181
If you just came in to look at that...

245
00:55:24,389 --> 00:55:26,266
... it'll cost ya

246
00:55:28,435 --> 00:55:29,937
Sorry...

247
00:55:30,104 --> 00:55:34,441
... I just wanted to know, the boat which just left, was it going to the mainland..

248
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:40,030
I need to contact the mainand. Can you help?

249
00:55:44,326 --> 00:55:47,204
Do you have a telephone? A radio?

250
00:55:52,251 --> 00:55:55,212
I don't suppose there's any chance I could post a letter?

251
00:55:59,925 --> 00:56:02,553
Well... put it in here..

252
00:56:02,803 --> 00:56:05,055
... they haven't taken it away in more than a month..

253
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,516
... but you can always hope.

254
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,144
Did you have another girl, an English girl...

255
00:56:10,269 --> 00:56:13,647
... try to post a letter, about two wveeks ago?

256
00:56:13,939 --> 00:56:15,732
Maybe...

257
00:56:16,984 --> 00:56:19,194
Can I look?

258
00:56:20,445 --> 00:56:22,406
Pease..

259
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:46,013
Take your time.

260
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,030
Thanks... I'll be going now

261
00:57:03,864 --> 00:57:06,241
You wouldn't know of any hotels here on the island..

262
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:09,828
... where I coud stay, until the boat sails again next week, woud you?

263
00:57:10,037 --> 00:57:12,456
No, sorry, lady...

264
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:16,627
No, I thought so. Thanks, anyway.

265
00:58:45,048 --> 00:58:47,384
Eizabeth...

266
00:58:47,926 --> 00:58:50,554
... you are back...

267
00:58:53,181 --> 00:58:56,268
I'll hope to God this letter reaches you in time.

268
00:58:56,768 --> 00:59:00,272
Don't come, Elizabeth. Your father knew...

269
00:59:00,439 --> 00:59:02,774
... he tried to protect you.

270
00:59:02,941 --> 00:59:07,446
Someone, or something, is trying to put the amulet together again.

271
00:59:07,863 --> 00:59:12,284
I have found the location of one of the pieces of the image of the beast.

272
00:59:12,451 --> 00:59:16,330
... she who was, and is not, and yet is.

273
00:59:16,455 --> 00:59:18,165
The amulet.

274
00:59:18,457 --> 00:59:23,337
... I must prevent the image of the beast ever being whole again.

275
00:59:24,004 --> 00:59:27,758
Pease, God, have mercy on my soul.'"

276
01:00:45,752 --> 01:00:47,379
Eizabeth?

277
01:00:47,546 --> 01:00:49,506
Are you all right?

278
01:00:49,631 --> 01:00:51,216
Eizabeth...

279
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,427
... please, open the door.

280
01:00:53,552 --> 01:00:56,513
I've been very worried all day.

281
01:00:56,638 --> 01:00:58,098
Where have you been?

282
01:00:58,223 --> 01:01:01,893
Liar. Go away, liar!

283
01:01:02,102 --> 01:01:04,020
What do you mean?

284
01:01:04,146 --> 01:01:08,024
- I don't understand.. - Liar!

285
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:12,112
I coud have been out of here by now, safe on the mainand...

286
01:01:12,904 --> 01:01:15,449
You're not making sense, Elizabeth...

287
01:01:15,699 --> 01:01:17,409
Let me in, please...

288
01:01:17,784 --> 01:01:22,622
The boat, Sarah. The boat to the mainland went this mornng.

289
01:01:23,123 --> 01:01:25,167
Oh God. Elizabeth.

290
01:01:25,292 --> 01:01:27,711
... I got it wrong, forgive me!

291
01:01:27,878 --> 01:01:30,922
You knew, Sarah! You knew!

292
01:01:31,089 --> 01:01:33,967
It was a mistake, believe me!

293
01:01:34,593 --> 01:01:37,220
don't know what to believe any more..

294
01:01:39,097 --> 01:01:42,934
I was sure the boat wasn't sailng until next week

295
01:01:45,103 --> 01:01:48,440
'm tired, Sarah, leave me alone..

296
01:01:50,609 --> 01:01:53,778
I'm as anxious as your are to leave this place...

297
01:01:54,362 --> 01:01:56,740
We're in danger, Elizabeth..

298
01:01:57,115 --> 01:01:59,534
... we must stick together

299
01:01:59,701 --> 01:02:03,079
I want to be left alone

300
01:02:03,413 --> 01:02:05,290
Alone.

301
01:04:05,452 --> 01:04:07,203
Do you want to eat?

302
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:16,504
Come inside. I've got something that could be of real interest to you.

303
01:04:17,505 --> 01:04:20,342
But it will cost you, I'm afraid

304
01:04:43,073 --> 01:04:45,200
Nobody ever liked her.

305
01:04:45,533 --> 01:04:48,161
... only that weird daughter of hers

306
01:04:48,745 --> 01:04:51,289
She hasn't changed all that much.

307
01:04:55,460 --> 01:05:01,716
And what about this. That weird daughter of hers got married to the American...

308
01:05:07,055 --> 01:05:08,807
Mother...

309
01:05:11,976 --> 01:05:14,354
Hey, lady, what's the matter?

310
01:05:16,564 --> 01:05:19,025
She hasn't changed so much..

311
01:06:16,124 --> 01:06:18,543
Venuchka...

312
01:06:21,421 --> 01:06:24,924
Eizabeth... my name's Elizabeth...

313
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:29,345
I don't know what you want from me, but I think you owe me an expanation...

314
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:34,017
You have changed, Venuchka...

315
01:06:34,184 --> 01:06:36,352
Don't call me that again!

316
01:06:36,519 --> 01:06:38,938
Don't you ever call me that!

317
01:06:39,939 --> 01:06:46,237
Is the wolf not a wolf if you call it by any other name?

318
01:06:46,488 --> 01:06:49,365
I don't need riddles, I need answers!

319
01:06:49,491 --> 01:06:51,493
Where is my mother?

320
01:06:52,076 --> 01:06:53,703
Dead...

321
01:06:54,162 --> 01:06:55,955
... she died for you.

322
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,332
Lies! That's all I ever got from my father.

323
01:06:57,457 --> 01:07:01,419
and now that's all I'm getting from you!

324
01:07:01,628 --> 01:07:05,006
This photograph was taken six years after my birth.

325
01:07:05,131 --> 01:07:07,634
... she didn't die giving birth to me

326
01:07:09,302 --> 01:07:12,263
I didn't say that..

327
01:07:12,806 --> 01:07:15,099
You said she's dead!

328
01:07:15,266 --> 01:07:17,143
She would be...

329
01:07:17,644 --> 01:07:21,231
... if she'd ever been born.

330
01:07:44,629 --> 01:07:46,464
Venuchka!

331
01:07:47,382 --> 01:07:48,925
Venuchka!

332
01:07:49,801 --> 01:07:49,926
Venuchka!

333
01:07:49,926 --> 01:07:52,011
Venuchka!

334
01:08:01,688 --> 01:08:03,940
Venuchka!

335
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,755
Venuchka!

336
01:08:28,006 --> 01:08:30,216
Venuchka!

337
01:08:30,842 --> 01:08:33,177
Venuchka!

338
01:08:40,435 --> 01:08:42,562
Venuchka!

339
01:08:42,812 --> 01:08:44,522
Venuchka!

340
01:08:44,898 --> 01:08:48,735
Venuchka... Venuchka...

341
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:02,832
Venuchka...

342
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:05,251
Venuchka...

343
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:21,309
Venuchka!

344
01:09:21,976 --> 01:09:23,811
Venuchka!

345
01:09:55,051 --> 01:09:57,345
Venuchka!

346
01:19:45,975 --> 01:19:47,977
No!

347
01:19:56,735 --> 01:19:58,279
Eizabeth...

348
01:19:58,487 --> 01:20:00,239
Eizabeth...

349
01:20:00,823 --> 01:20:02,700
Oh God. what have you done?

350
01:20:02,866 --> 01:20:04,618
Eizabeth!

351
01:21:43,425 --> 01:21:45,094
Sarah?

352
01:21:48,472 --> 01:21:50,307
I've been waiting for you..

353
01:21:50,474 --> 01:21:51,809
... 'sister'.

354
01:21:51,975 --> 01:21:53,769
Why, Sarah?

355
01:21:54,061 --> 01:21:55,896
Why?

356
01:21:56,897 --> 01:21:59,775
Our father was scared of what you are.

357
01:21:59,942 --> 01:22:03,237
... you, so pretty and so like him...

358
01:22:03,487 --> 01:22:07,074
He thought region would save you... Foo!

359
01:22:07,282 --> 01:22:09,451
I think it's madness.

360
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:11,912
... I think we shoud stop it.

361
01:22:12,162 --> 01:22:14,623
Stopping it we're stopping us

362
01:22:15,624 --> 01:22:17,960
It's part of us. Elizabeth

363
01:22:18,919 --> 01:22:21,130
It's not part of me...

364
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,259
What are you afraid of, Elizabeth?

365
01:22:27,594 --> 01:22:30,013
Are you afraid of this?

366
01:22:33,892 --> 01:22:36,603
You're afraid of yourself...

367
01:22:40,983 --> 01:22:42,860
You're mad...

368
01:22:43,402 --> 01:22:45,863
... I've got nothing to do with you.

369
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:53,912
Don't cover your true self..

370
01:22:54,037 --> 01:22:57,499
.. our father tried, but it all was in vain.

371
01:22:58,208 --> 01:22:59,960
We are daughters of the Beast...

372
01:23:00,377 --> 01:23:06,425
... born from the union of a human being and the mother of eternal sorrow.

373
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:08,427
We need you...

374
01:23:10,012 --> 01:23:11,680
No...

375
01:23:12,222 --> 01:23:16,393
Now. this time. I will not allow it...

376
01:23:16,643 --> 01:23:20,939
... this time you won't ruin everythng, like you did 20

377
01:23:46,131 --> 01:23:48,383
Is our mother here?

378
01:23:50,093 --> 01:23:51,804
Yes...

379
01:23:53,096 --> 01:23:55,599
... our real mother is here

380
01:23:57,893 --> 01:24:01,063
Go... and meet her..

381
01:25:07,796 --> 01:25:10,966
Partake of the human's flesh...

382
01:25:13,051 --> 01:25:15,888
... awaken the beast inside..

383
01:25:25,564 --> 01:25:29,651
... and rejoice in the triumph of sorrow!

384
01:26:31,088 --> 01:26:32,422
Daddy.

385
01:26:32,589 --> 01:26:34,800
... it's part of me, Daddy...

386
01:26:35,092 --> 01:26:37,928
It's winning. Daddy.. it's winning.

387
01:26:38,095 --> 01:26:40,389
... they made me do it, Daddy...

388
01:28:43,386 --> 01:28:45,347
'For those who are blind, shall see..

389
01:28:45,472 --> 01:28:48,308
... the true face of the beast...

390
01:28:48,433 --> 01:28:51,895
... and forever suffer it in their soul.'
