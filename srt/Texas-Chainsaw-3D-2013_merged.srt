So did I.

178
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,127
I just wanted to have a child.

179
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,211
GAVIN: Enough.

180
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,671
- I wanted to have a child so bad...
- Enough!

181
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,340
- ...and I couldn't!
- Enough, Arlene. Enough!

182
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,051
Why couldn't you tell me?

183
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,553
Tell you what?

184
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,138
Your mother has a defective uterus?

185
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,641
She wanted a kid. End of story.

186
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,895
So what? We're not
good enough for you now?

187
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,104
I didn't say that.

188
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:35,149
I just wanna know where I came from

189
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,275
and who I came from.

190
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,527
Well, we're the ones that raised you.

191
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,863
And you were damn lucky, I'd say.

192
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,531
Those people were...

193
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:44,770
I can't even put that into words.

194
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:45,951
- There are no words...
GAVIN: - Shut up, Arlene.

195
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:47,620
- ...for that, Heather.
- Shut up!

196
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,334
You came from a shit heap.

197
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,421
There. Now you know.

198
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,174
If I'd had half a mind, I'd've left you there.

Heather.

204
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,316
Heather. You go down there
you're gonna bring trouble on us.

205
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,692
What are you talking about?

206
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:21,320
Trust me.

- Like shit.

It sucks when you find out

211
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,976
your parents have been
lying to you your whole life.

Baby, I'm sorry.

213
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,728
I was adopted.

214
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,276
I never felt right about them.

215
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:03,946
I'm gonna go pack.

216
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:05,948
- For Texas, not New Orleans.
- Wait.

217
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,783
- Hold on.
- No, Ryan. I have to go.

- Forget Halloween.
- Wait. Wait, just listen to me, please.

- That's really cool art.

00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,153

- How about here?

356
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,660
What is going on here?

357
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:14,037
(CHUCKLES) Wow.

358
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:15,747
Some fine dining.

359
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:20,335
- Heather, can I open this one?
- Yeah.

KENNY: Wow.

361
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:28,468

365
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:36,059
What exactly did Granny do for a living?

366
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:38,270
I have no idea.

00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,021
Hey! Check this out!

368
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:45,159
Look like Granny liked to play a little pool.

369
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:47,863

372
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:53,618
Okay, rack 'em up.

373
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:55,503
- What'd you say about my rack?
- Rack 'em up.

374
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,956
- Oh!
- Whoo.

375
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,708
Now it's a party!

Y'all have to let me cook for you tonight.

388
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,382
RYAN: Yeah. And you can thank Darryl.

389
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:54,864
He's the one
splurging on the steaks, ain't that right?

390
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,408
Hey, Shreveport can wait.

391
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,292
