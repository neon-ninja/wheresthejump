00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,069
<i>Dad.</i>

2
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,504
<i>I've gone to the city.</i>

3
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:15,707
<i>Please don't come for me.</i>

4
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:20,646
<i>There's a curfew here. Just... just keep them safe.</i>

5
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,549
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

6
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,754
<i>I love you.</i>

7
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:39,098
<i>You are listening to NPR.
I'm host, David Newborn,</i>

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,868
<i>and this is Global Position.
Now for today's top headlines.</i>

9
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,237
<i>Months after the initial worldwide outbreak,</i>

10
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,739
<i>national and local governments are beginning to suppress</i>

11
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:50,342
<i>the necroambulis virus epidemic.</i>

12
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:54,546
<i>The Department of Agriculture has found
no solution for infected, dying crops.</i>

13
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,783
<i>Agriculture Officials are encouraging
farmers to burn their crops</i>

14
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:01,120
<i>in a desperate attempt to destroy
what may be preventing growth.</i>

15
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,891
<i>Please return to your homes.</i>

16
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,193
<i>Curfew is at 8:00.</i>

17
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,836
<i>While citizens of inner cities and
metropolitan areas remain hardest hit,</i>

18
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,872
<i>through quick response and quarantine,</i>

19
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,341
<i>weekly infections reports have dropped 30%.</i>

20
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,351
<i>Cleanup and martial law are still in effect.</i>

21
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,920
<i>Medical officials, along with the CDC,</i>

22
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:37,756
<i>have been tight-lipped about a cure or vaccine.</i>

23
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,932
<i>As for the infected, scientists are now suggesting</i>

24
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:50,169
<i>that an elevated sense of smell is the telltale sign</i>

25
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:53,772
<i>of what's being referred to as "the turn."</i>

26
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,990
Check this one for infection.

27
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,359
- Look at that skin.
- <i>Yeah, we caught another, 10-4.</i>

28
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,829
<i>Curfew-breaker. See if infected, over.
Get her here.</i>

29
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,490
<i>Doctors with stage three patients are reminded</i>

30
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:22,361
<i>quarantine pickup is at 1700 hours.</i>

31
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,871
Sir? You shouldn't be in here.

32
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,307
This is the shelter for the infected.
It's dangerous.

33
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,342
But my daughter is here.

34
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,480
- What's her name?
- Maggie.

35
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,349
Marguerite.
Marguerite Vogel.

36
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,618
Marguerite Vogel...

37
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,063
Mr. Vogel?

38
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,767
Your daughter's bite wound was very severe.

39
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,471
Now, we may know a lot about this,

40
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,007
except that we can't stop this yet.

41
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,779
She's probably going to show more signs of aggression.

42
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,616
She's gonna lose her appetite, and
then she's gonna get it back again.

43
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,355
Look at me.

44
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,957
When that happens, take her to quarantine.

45
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,861
I wouldn't normally release
someone with her type infection.

46
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,064
I'm doing this as a favor for Vern.

47
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,099
Quarantine is eight weeks in.

48
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:37,703
Say your goodbyes and get her straight to Blaire.

49
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,038
I'll send all the necessary paperwork to Vern.

50
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,608
He'll follow up and answer any questions you have.

51
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,045
Good luck, Mr. Vogel.

52
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,735
Dad? Dad!

53
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,747
- I'm sorry.
- I've been searching everywhere for you.

54
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,449
I'm sorry.

55
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,164
What did he say?

56
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,467
The doctor?

57
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,106
Vern helped us get you out.

58
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,948
Stop picking at it!

59
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,061
- Where are you going?
- Inside.

60
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,169
- Mag.
- I'll be fine.

61
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,666
Hello?

62
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,810
Hello?

63
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

64
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,576
Maggie? Maggie?
Get in the truck!

65
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:41,613
- What's wrong?
- Just do it right now. Come on. Go.

66
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,357
Mom! Daddy's home!

67
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,828
Slow down, honey! Oh!

68
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,131
- Did you pack your bag?
- Mm-hm.

69
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:09,067
- Is Pretty Pony going?
- Mm...

70
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:12,270
You're not taking Pretty Pony?

71
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,207
- Got everything you need?
- Yeah.

72
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,853
- Molly!
- Daddy!

73
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,462
We missed you.

74
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:41,232
- It's so good to see you.
- Hey. Hey, Moll.

75
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,401
What happened to your arm?

76
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,070
Oh, uh...

77
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,407
I just got hurt.

78
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,410
I scratched mine.

79
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,213
But Mommy fixed it.

80
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,882
- Who fixed yours?
- Uh, the doctors.

81
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,785
Is that where you were?

82
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:03,888
Yeah. It took a while for them to fix it.

83
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,416
I missed you.

84
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,911
Dad said you were sick...

85
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,881
but you're dying, huh?

86
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,950
Bobby...

87
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,990
A few kids at my school got infected.

88
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:15,226
I knew one of them. Steven.

89
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:21,966
I didn't like him much, but...
I don't think he deserved to die.

90
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,440
Does it hurt?

91
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:33,444
No. Not anymore.

92
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,889
Why do we have to stay with Aunt Linda?

93
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,261
Because I'm contagious.

94
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,199
Mom's afraid we'll get it.

95
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,869
Just because she loves you.

96
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:06,544
Hey. Go on, and be nice to Molly.

97
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,850
Bobby?

98
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:16,287
- I missed you, kiddo.
- Missed you, too.

99
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,903
Ready?

100
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,160
<i>They tell us that patients have days left</i>

101
00:14:56,162 --> 00:15:00,064
<i>before what they're considering the final stage.</i>

102
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:05,069
<i>And stay tuned at the top of the hour.
We'll be in conversation...</i>

103
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,573
Why don't you get settled and help me with the dishes?

104
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,438
Caroline is fixing us something to eat.

105
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,007
I'm not hungry.

106
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,754
Allie called a few times.

107
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,043
Two weeks?

108
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:00,284
You spent two weeks out there looking for me?

109
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,725
Yeah.

110
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,733
I made a promise to your mother,

111
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,802
that I would protect you.

112
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:25,209
Yeah, but...
what about you guys?

113
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:29,781
- What if I hurt you?
- Don't worry.

114
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:33,051
Caroline and I, we know the precautions.

115
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,733
You shouldn't have brought me back.

116
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,472
You have to eat something.

117
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,642
For me.

118
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,213
I'll try.

119
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,837
Maggie?
Where are your bandages?

120
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,610
I'm so glad I came down.

121
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,155
I know, I know. I...

122
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,691
I just can't look at it.

123
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:49,760
I can't see it, knowing what's going to happen to her.

124
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:53,231
I just can't do it, Wade.
I'm...

125
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,899
I'm sorry.

126
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,852
I just don't understand.
I...

127
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:18,156
I keep asking Him and asking Him,

128
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,859
but... He's not giving me any answers.

129
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,831
Wade?

130
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,809
- <i>You've reached Fred and...</i>
- <i>Ken.</i>

131
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,278
<i>And we're currently out on the farm.</i>

132
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,714
<i>Leave us a message and we'll get back to you.</i>

133
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,950
<i>Oh, that was awful.</i>

134
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:21,219
<i>That was pretty funny, though.</i>

135
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,448
<i>What do you think about the schools opening up?</i>

136
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,317
<i>No, you need to stop pretending</i>

137
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,885
<i>bad things ain't happening out there.</i>

138
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,353
<i>Bad things?</i>

139
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,412
<i>Well now, as the government sanction...</i>

140
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:32,817
<i>...people are ID'ed in the system
and sent home with families.</i>

141
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,119
<i>They even have forced appointments
with their local doctors,</i>

142
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:37,922
<i>who report back to the hospitals in the cities.</i>

143
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:39,690
<i>And if they violate their allotted time,</i>

144
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:43,828
<i>Yeah. And how long does it take to turn?</i>

145
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,730
<i>How long is that allotted time?</i>

146
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,399
<i>They say six to eight weeks for any one person to turn.</i>

147
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:52,370
<i>But, well, we know it's different
depending on who you are.</i>

148
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,971
<i>And what if someone turned early?</i>

149
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>I mean, how many people they gonna hurt...</i>

150
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,150
Maggie!

151
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,521
No. No.

152
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:13,090
<i>You don't do that and then leave.</i>

153
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,159
<i>You don't send half of them home to their families</i>

154
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,761
<i>and hope they come back to be killed.</i>

155
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:18,129
<i>You just kill them.
That's all.</i>

156
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:23,100
Mag! Are you okay?

157
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:28,038
Your finger!

158
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,477
--Come on, I've got you.

159
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,182
Here, sweetie. Sit down.

160
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,119
- Caroline?
- Let's see what I have.

161
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:48,192
I'll call our doctor.

162
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:03,507
- Yes, it's Mrs. Vogel.
- Caroline Vogel.

163
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:07,478
Yes, I'm--
I'm calling about my stepdaughter.

164
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,016
It's urgent.

165
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:30,534
It's an emergency.

166
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:47,244
Get behind me.

167
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,585
Nathan.

168
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:58,155
No, don't!
Please, Dad. No. Please!

169
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:02,092
Go home. Just go home.

170
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:09,099
--Please, say something.

171
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,776
Nathan, please.

172
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,273
I asked him to say something.

173
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:26,143
Maggie used to babysit for her.

174
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:29,980
It had to be done.
Ain't nobody fighting that.

175
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:34,685
Bonnie was wrong for what she done.

176
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:39,189
- Was she?
- She kept them in the house and didn't notify anybody.

177
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,094
She should have brought them into quarantine.

178
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,697
We had damn near the whole station out there.

179
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,527
Now we can't even find Bonnie.

180
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,806
Look, Wade.
When the time comes...

181
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:59,009
- Now, Ray...
- I know.

182
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:03,981
I know what you're thinking,
but... it's for the best.

183
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,083
You think about what those two could have done today

184
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:09,019
if you hadn't have been out there.

185
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,788
Quarantine rules apply to everybody, Wade.

186
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,691
- I mean, wake up! Look at the--
- Holt!

187
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,292
Go call the trucks down from Owensboro.

188
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,695
Tell them we've got two bodies to clean up.

189
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,465
Holt.

190
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,403
Unbelievable.

191
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:31,408
Now, Ray, you and I, we go back a long ways.

192
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,344
You've always done us right,

193
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:37,948
especially after Sarah's passing.

194
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,350
But I swear to God,

195
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:43,454
if you, him, or anyone else come out here for her...

196
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:46,090
She's my daughter, Ray.

197
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:57,101
Trucks will be down here in the
morning, pick up the remains.

198
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,476
Wade...

199
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,380
Think about what you had to do today,

200
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:13,283
what you might have to do in the future.

201
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,378
How is she?

202
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,349
She asleep?

203
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:48,519
Her finger is gone.
She made sure of that.

204
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:50,420
I got it all bandaged up,

205
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:55,025
but she's still refusing to go to the doctor.

206
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,294
I figured that.

207
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,032
What did Ray say?

208
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:05,536
He said that Bonnie kept them locked up for a while.

209
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,571
Too long.

210
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,275
I killed them both.

211
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:14,444
No. You, uh...

212
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,814
They'd already moved on.

213
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:21,852
- There was something in their eyes.
- Wade.

214
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:25,489
You can't do this to yourself.

215
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,425
Bonnie should have taken them in.

216
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,397
And what about Mag?

217
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,466
What happens when she gets close?

218
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:40,037
Don't think about that right now.

219
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:44,842
Just... just...

220
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:50,314
Let's enjoy the time we have with her.

221
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,537
- What is it?
- Shh.

222
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,349
Wade?

223
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,558
Stay here.

224
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,649
Bonnie?

225
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,158
It's late.

226
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,233
How's Mag?

227
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,606
About as good as she can be.

228
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:34,184
Doctors gave us all these special rules

229
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:38,188
and papers for children with her condition.

230
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,327
"Lock subject in room at night.

231
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:46,496
"Avoid touching subject without gloves."

232
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:49,666
Never once said her name.

233
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,369
Julia.

234
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,712
She's just four.

235
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:04,281
She was scared.

236
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:08,051
She slept with us most nights as it was, so we'd...

237
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,756
We'd take turns with her through nights.

238
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,195
She got worse.

239
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,567
One night Nathan went in,

240
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:27,471
didn't wake me for my turn.
Next morning, door was locked.

241
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,709
Locked himself in with her.

242
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:37,180
I pounded and pounded on that damn door,

243
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:40,751
cried till I couldn't no more.

244
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:44,755
Still, never answered.

245
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,593
But he knew.

246
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,697
He knew what he was doing.

247
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,105
Take me to where they're at.

248
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,777
Dad! There's someone on the phone.

249
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,083
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Vogel?</i>

250
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:50,520
- Yes?
- <i>Yes. Hello, sir. This is Mr. Garmen</i>

251
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:53,423
<i>from the quarantine unit of St. Mary's Hospital.</i>

252
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:56,726
<i>We're calling to inform you that we've
scheduled a follow up appointment</i>

253
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,863
<i>with Dr. Vern Kaplan to track
your daughter's progress</i>

254
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:02,465
<i>in advance of quarantine.</i>

255
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:09,072
Tomorrow we're gonna go and see Vern about your finger.

256
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:12,809
No arguments.
You hear me?

257
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,810
James, Carrie, get over here.

258
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:49,179
Right now!

259
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:51,581
Come here, sit by Mama.

260
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,634
--Wade.

261
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,471
- Vern.
- Maggie.

262
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:25,782
Okay, take a deep breath for me.

263
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:27,584
--Let it out.

264
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,755
Lungs are clear.

265
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:36,059
Scans show that the asthma has receded already,

266
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,862
and your heartbeat is abnormally strong.

267
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:41,564
That's a good sign.

268
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,670
Now... let's have a look at your arm.

269
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,517
Looks like the origin site is spreading.

270
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,888
Maggie, what happened here?

271
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,691
- She broke it.
- I cut it off.

272
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,560
Why would you do such a thing?

273
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:13,530
What good's a finger if your arm's falling off?

274
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:16,266
Maggie, your arm is not going to fall off.

275
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:18,968
Now, there's a lot we don't know about this thing,

276
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:23,873
but this decay, it'll stop.

277
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:28,311
Your arm is yours to keep.
You got me?

278
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:30,747
I'm gonna take a sample, okay?

279
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,784
Allie's been asking about you.

280
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:39,088
Said she tried to call a few times.

281
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,191
I know she'd love to hear from you, so...

282
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:45,295
give her a call, okay?

283
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:47,063
Doctor's orders.

284
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,635
All right, all done.

285
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,077
All we gotta do now is put a dressing on it.

286
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,347
I'll have Judy come in and take care of that.

287
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,688
There you are.

288
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,359
She's strong,

289
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:51,394
but from what I've seen,

290
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,630
it's progressing fast in her.

291
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:58,635
Pretty soon, she ain't gonna want any food.

292
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:01,237
She's gonna want something more.

293
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:05,308
Skin will start smelling like meat.

294
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,411
When it finally happens, you're gonna have a few choices.

295
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,282
One, take her to quarantine.

296
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:16,185
I'm not gonna do that.

297
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:18,254
I wasn't suggesting it.

298
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:21,090
My report will say she's progressing slow,

299
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:23,393
so it'll buy you some time.

300
00:44:23,395 --> 00:44:26,729
Option two:

301
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:30,099
We give her the cocktail they'd give her in quarantine.

302
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:32,735
At least this way she'd be with you when she takes it,

303
00:44:32,737 --> 00:44:36,339
and not a bunch of strangers or other infected people.

304
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:41,944
But you know how she doesn't feel anything right now?

305
00:44:41,946 --> 00:44:44,947
She will feel this.

306
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:49,419
Reports say that it's painful.

307
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:50,987
Extremely.

308
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:54,157
All the way up till the end.

309
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,827
What's option three?

310
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:02,198
Make it quick.

311
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,440
Caroline, the food is delicious.

312
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:21,277
Oh...
Ah, the stove is shot. I...

313
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,913
Some of it's really...

314
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:31,454
You think this is funny? Hm?

315
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:36,325
--Well, no dessert for either of you.

316
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:39,262
Is that a threat or a stay of execution?

317
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,856
Why do you even still have this piece of crap?

318
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:08,991
Well, because I trust this piece of crap.

319
00:47:11,095 --> 00:47:13,196
You know, Caroline had four cars now,

320
00:47:13,198 --> 00:47:16,165
- and they all broke down.
- Yeah, I know.

321
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:18,835
I had to pick her up the last time.

322
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:21,537
What did you pick her up in?

323
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,239
You see?

324
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,346
What are you reading there?

325
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:33,482
Uh, it's called
"Morning Light of the Past."

326
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:36,185
It was in one of Mom's boxes.

327
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,355
It's like really, really weird.

328
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:44,527
Your mother was a bookworm.

329
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:50,066
Until today, I still don't know what she saw in me...

330
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:54,237
because she had everything.

331
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,873
She was smart, beautiful,

332
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:59,609
- and she had those long legs.
- Okay. Okay, Dad. Thank you.

333
00:47:59,611 --> 00:48:03,446
- That's enough.
- What? I mean, I'm just saying.

334
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:07,383
I mean, the whole time we dated,
she always pushed books on me.

335
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,886
She always wanted me to read more.

336
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,058
And I just didn't have the time with the farm and all.

337
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,629
- You read to me all the time.
- Only because she made me.

338
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:24,467
I remember just before you were born...

339
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,471
and I bought a whole bunch of books.

340
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:31,340
And your mother had a hell of a green thumb.

341
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:33,643
And there was this one book

342
00:48:33,645 --> 00:48:36,545
that I read to you over and over.

343
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:40,383
It was called, uh,
"A Daisy's Journey."

344
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:43,452
That's actually how you got your name.

345
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:48,491
- There's a Marguerite in it?
- And your mother loved those flowers.

346
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:50,927
She just loved them.

347
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,365
And she was so strong.

348
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:59,201
I mean, every time she needed to fight back,

349
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:01,570
she did.

350
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:05,474
You have a lot of your mother in you.
You know that?

351
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:19,088
You know, maybe it was the, um, truck.

352
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,494
What?

353
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:26,329
Why Mom loved you.

354
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:33,169
Well, that's for sure.

355
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:35,204
My truck.

356
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:42,011
<i>No!</i>

357
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>No!</i>
--No! No!

358
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:13,502
Maggie? Allie's here.

359
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:21,710
Hey. Oh my God.
There she is!

360
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:24,413
Shut up.

361
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,714
- Oh...
- Hi!

362
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,716
Where have you been?

363
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:30,820
Oh. Well, I haven't been feeling too well.

364
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:32,755
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

365
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:35,257
Well, how are you feeling right now?

366
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:38,194
- Uh, right now?
- Yeah.

367
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:40,563
Um... why?

368
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:44,133
Okay. All right.
Trent and Candace and a few other people

369
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:46,368
are going out to the reservoir tonight.

370
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:51,373
I know it's not like a super fun trip to KC or whatever,

371
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:54,410
but school starts soon and I doubt our parents

372
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:57,279
are gonna let us out much further than that.

373
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:01,350
- Trent's going?
- Yeah. Did you hear?

374
00:52:01,352 --> 00:52:05,221
Yeah. How's he doing?

375
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:08,457
I don't know.
I mean, he seems all right,

376
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,759
but don't take my word for it.

377
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:13,295
You should come see for yourself.

378
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,764
Right.

379
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:20,269
Come on. Everybody misses you.
They wanna see you.

380
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:21,871
I miss you,

381
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:24,473
and I'm not going without you.
Okay?

382
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:28,777
Hey, uh, hold on real quick.

383
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:31,647
- What?
- Here.

384
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:36,552
I found it on the couch the other
day and threw it on this old thing.

385
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:39,455
I figured you might wanna wear it.

386
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:46,896
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's nothing.

387
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:50,900
Go, get out of here before Allie explodes.

388
00:52:50,902 --> 00:52:52,501
Yeah, I know, right?
We are late.

389
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:56,939
And you have a nice young man waiting for you.

390
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:58,774
Is it gonna be like this all night?

391
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:00,743
- Um, yes.
- Oh god!

392
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:03,345
- Yes, it actually is.
- Take me now.

393
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:47,756
Oh, here we go!

394
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:49,358
- Hey! How are you?
- Hey.

395
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,827
- Hey!
- Hi. Long time no see!

396
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,276
<i>I don't get why they're opening up the school so soon.</i>

397
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:10,779
- Gotta get back to normal.
- Normal?

398
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:13,249
What's normal about all of this?

399
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:15,351
Now, we have teachers missing.

400
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:17,526
Still have a bunch of infected people.

401
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,422
No offense.
Not you guys.

402
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:23,459
But like the Andersons.
You know?

403
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:26,795
- How many more are like that?
- What happened?

404
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,931
She had them locked up in a room.

405
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:32,968
Didn't tell anybody.

406
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:36,438
And they got out, and Mag's dad found her.

407
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,375
Holy shit, Mag.
What'd your dad do?

408
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:41,910
Look, does it matter?
They're dead.

409
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:43,946
Point is, she screwed up.

410
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:48,617
I mean, how many other people have
people locked away? You know?

411
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,753
What should Bonnie have done?

412
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:53,289
What would you do?

413
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:56,892
What should my dad do to me?
Quarantine?

414
00:54:56,894 --> 00:54:59,828
Do you know what it's like there?

415
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,867
My uncle works at the hospital in KC.

416
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:07,936
He said that they tell people everything's nice.

417
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:11,940
That they'll--
they'll hold your hand until the end,

418
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:14,910
but they don't.

419
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:18,047
They throw you in a big room with everyone else.

420
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:20,783
They don't separate the phases.

421
00:55:20,785 --> 00:55:23,585
Everyone's all bunched up together,

422
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:27,823
people eating people,

423
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:31,060
and they don't care.

424
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:32,594
So what would you do?

425
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:37,766
You know what I would do to me?

426
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,338
I'd put a gun right here.

427
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:45,674
Bang.

428
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:02,558
Mason's a dick.

429
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:07,363
He's just afraid.

430
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:09,631
Yeah, but he's still a dick.

431
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:19,875
You know he stayed over the night before I got bit?

432
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:27,383
Played video games and got into all of Dad's beer.

433
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:31,153
And when he found out, he put me to
work in the field the next morning.

434
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:36,792
She looked really bad, Mag.

435
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:42,164
I don't know why I went over to her, but I did.

436
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:45,067
Felt bad, I guess.

437
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:50,706
I told her to stay there,

438
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:54,610
but when I turned around to call for Dad...

439
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:59,114
she bit me.

440
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:04,453
I could see it in her eyes.

441
00:57:04,455 --> 00:57:07,022
She regretted it.

442
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:09,725
Probably didn't even know she did it.

443
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,896
Then Dad showed up.

444
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:17,466
He shot her in the chest and in the head.

445
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,975
I'm sorry.

446
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:29,111
It's not your fault.

447
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:33,882
No. No. I mean...

448
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:35,918
about us.

449
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:40,088
I figured I'd done something wrong.

450
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:44,660
No. I was just...

451
00:57:44,662 --> 00:57:46,862
scared, I guess.

452
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:49,932
Yeah. Me, too.

453
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:56,238
I missed you.

454
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,240
I missed you, too.

455
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,822
I missed that.

456
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,791
So did I.

457
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,920
Well...

458
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:47,723
Thanks.

459
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:51,093
Yeah. I'm gonna see you
again this weekend, right?

460
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:54,263
Yeah. I promise.

461
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,201
Okay. Well, I'm going to hold you to it.

462
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:01,570
Yeah, when don't you?

463
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,815
Hey, wait. Wait.

464
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:18,120
I love you, okay?

465
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,658
I love you, too.

466
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,100
- I'm gonna let you go.
- Okay.

467
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:58,360
Dad?

468
00:59:58,362 --> 01:00:01,330
Hey.
There's no need to shout.

469
01:00:01,332 --> 01:00:04,299
He's downstairs.

470
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:08,604
- Let me see.
- Not too close.

471
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:10,339
I'll be fine.

472
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,881
Do you smell that?

473
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:20,383
No.

474
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,357
Are you sure?
It smells like food.

475
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:33,261
It's probably your father cooking
up something you shouldn't have.

476
01:00:33,263 --> 01:00:35,897
I'll get the drops.

477
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,407
Wade?

478
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:13,001
Caroline?
You find the drops?

479
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:16,138
No! No. Hold on a sec.

480
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:31,186
Oh, hey, did you find them?

481
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,256
Thanks.

482
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:43,932
So, what was Dad cooking?

483
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:52,140
- Caroline?
- Oh, uh...

484
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:56,078
Nothing. Hm... Nothing.

485
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,735
Maggie? Phone!

486
01:02:19,737 --> 01:02:21,369
Hello?

487
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:24,473
Trent?

488
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:26,141
What?

489
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:55,403
Trent.

490
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,939
Please.

491
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,242
Just open the door.

492
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,112
Please.

493
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:13,488
What are you doing in here?

494
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:18,126
Just let me talk to him.

495
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,542
Trent?

496
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,578
Maggie.

497
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:44,319
I can't open the door.

498
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:47,556
I smelled him, Mag.

499
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:50,959
I can't go to quarantine.

500
01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:58,834
<i>We're ready for the extraction and will confirm with you</i>

501
01:03:58,836 --> 01:04:01,436
<i>- that we are en route.</i>
- Easy, gentlemen. Easy.

502
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:03,338
<i>Go ahead with the extraction.</i>

503
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:07,042
Your uncle said he would take care of you!

504
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:10,011
- He said it wouldn't be like the others.
- I won't go!

505
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:18,320
Look, I know that you're scared.

506
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,390
I am, too.

507
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:32,601
But you are so strong.

508
01:04:32,603 --> 01:04:34,436
I've always seen that in you.

509
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:43,011
Just... just let me in!

510
01:04:43,013 --> 01:04:45,080
This is the police.
We are entering the home!

511
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,651
Let's go.

512
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:15,977
Get away from the door, Maggie.

513
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:22,150
Maggie? Please?

514
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,229
You need to open the door!

515
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:39,567
Come on, son.
It's time.

516
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:43,271
Trent?
Just open the door.

517
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:51,012
Step back, son.

518
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:01,089
Dad? Please? Dad, please!

519
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:02,657
- Dad! Dad! Dad!
- Listen.

520
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:05,126
- It's gonna be okay! Trent!
- Maggie!

521
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:08,596
It's gonna be okay!

522
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:16,338
Go home, Maggie.

523
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,006
Just go home.

524
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:17,826
Dais? Maggie!

525
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:28,603
Wade? Oh!

526
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:33,241
Maggie!

527
01:08:33,243 --> 01:08:35,443
Wade!

528
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:40,181
Wade!
We have to take her in!

529
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:42,317
- No! No! No!
- We have to take her in now!

530
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,818
No!

531
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:56,397
Look at me. Look at me.

532
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,634
Good, Daisy baby.
That's good.

533
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:02,770
Now tell me.
What happened?

534
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:04,772
- Hey, come on.
- Don't!

535
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:08,843
I'm not moving!
I'm not moving.

536
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:10,845
He was afraid of me.

537
01:09:10,847 --> 01:09:13,381
I didn't know it.
I didn't know it.

538
01:09:13,383 --> 01:09:16,151
I swear, I didn't know it.
I didn't know it.

539
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:18,920
What was?
What was afraid of you?

540
01:09:18,922 --> 01:09:23,258
The fox. The fox.

541
01:09:25,896 --> 01:09:28,496
I heard--
I heard it and then I--

542
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:32,467
And then I caught it in the trap, and it smelled...

543
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:36,437
I couldn't stop.

544
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:39,841
I couldn't stop.
I couldn't stop.

545
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:42,610
Daddy, I just wanted to help it!

546
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:46,681
Daddy, I just wanted to help it!
I'm sorry!

547
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,856
Don't.

548
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:56,724
I'm sorry.

549
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,370
It's okay.

550
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:17,612
It's okay.

551
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,626
Wade, please,

552
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:41,663
just call them.
It's time now.

553
01:11:41,665 --> 01:11:43,364
She has to go in.

554
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,839
What if it was Molly?

555
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,909
Or Bobby?

556
01:11:54,911 --> 01:11:59,047
After everything that we've been through,

557
01:11:59,049 --> 01:12:01,449
you still think it's about that?

558
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:06,321
I've loved her like she was my own,

559
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:08,489
but she's not her anymore.

560
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:14,462
- Wade, please.
- Don't.

561
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,729
I'm chewing so loud.

562
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,413
She was afraid of me, wasn't she?

563
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,756
When did she leave?

564
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,094
Yesterday.

565
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:32,473
I don't feel well.

566
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

567
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,095
You got enough firewood there?

568
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:03,831
Well, if you'd get the power turned back on again,

569
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,133
I wouldn't have to do this everyday.

570
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:08,703
Well, you know that's not my department.

571
01:15:08,705 --> 01:15:10,271
So, why are you here?

572
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:14,642
Need to talk to you about Mag.

573
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:16,577
The time's come, Wade.

574
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,582
Can we see her?

575
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:25,686
- This is bullshit.
- Holt.

576
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:28,523
No. She's well beyond the time.
She needs to be in quarantine.

577
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:31,259
We've got an entire town to protect!

578
01:15:31,261 --> 01:15:33,124
I'm going to the house, Wade.

579
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:37,231
You know she needs to be in quarantine.

580
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:42,703
Wade...

581
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:45,740
Get out of my way.

582
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:48,776
Now, come on, boys.
We don't need this.

583
01:15:48,778 --> 01:15:52,547
Wade, just...

584
01:15:52,549 --> 01:15:55,016
let us take a look at her.
All right?

585
01:15:55,018 --> 01:15:57,685
You're not gonna take her in.

586
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:15,636
--Wade!

587
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:24,312
--Wade!

588
01:16:24,314 --> 01:16:28,583
Stop it!

589
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,254
Leave us alone.

590
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:38,292
Maggie, you tell me you're doing
okay, and we'll leave. All right?

591
01:16:38,294 --> 01:16:42,663
Ray, look at her.

592
01:16:42,665 --> 01:16:43,998
I'm all right.

593
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,868
Good.

594
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:50,371
That's all I needed to know.

595
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:52,273
Get your ass in the car.

596
01:16:58,046 --> 01:17:01,349
Get in the goddamn car.

597
01:17:01,351 --> 01:17:03,851
- Now, Ray...
- Shut up and listen.

598
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:06,754
I'll be back.

599
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:09,056
Between now and then,

600
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:11,626
you need to figure out what you're gonna do.

601
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:15,963
I'm sorry about what happened.
I am...

602
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:20,234
but you and her ain't the only ones in this town.

603
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:34,315
Are you okay?

604
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:37,652
- Are you?
- Yeah.

605
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:41,956
- What happened?
- Sit down.

606
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:44,358
They wanna take me away, don't they?

607
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:48,329
Don't worry.

608
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:51,832
You're not going anywhere.

609
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:05,746
There's something I want to show you.

610
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:23,230
It's Mama's garden.
But how?

611
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:29,837
It was your idea.

612
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:34,408
Before you ran off, you said that I should
plant some daisies in Mom's garden.

613
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:37,044
That they would grow.

614
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:41,082
After you left,

615
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:43,250
I planted some.

616
01:18:43,252 --> 01:18:46,420
And when we came back, this was here.

617
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:51,759
It's the most beautiful thing ever.

618
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:05,239
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

619
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:17,351
You have to promise me that you'll do it.

620
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:20,221
Please.

621
01:19:20,223 --> 01:19:23,758
Promise me that you'll make it stop.

622
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,399
I just can't...

623
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:37,104
I can't do it anymore.
You know?

624
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,442
Please, Dad. Please?

625
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:49,383
You have to do it.
Please.

626
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:59,059
- Please.
- Okay, baby.

627
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:43,037
This is what they give the quarantined.

628
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,328
You want my personal opinion?

629
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:13,467
Use that instead.

630
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,423
Hey, munchkins.

631
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:44,531
I just wanted to call to say that I love you guys.

632
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:48,168
Bobby, Holly.

633
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:51,005
I just wanted to say...

634
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:53,540
Is that you, Holly?

635
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:56,977
Tell him thank you for bringing me home.

636
01:21:56,979 --> 01:22:01,916
I just...
It was horrible.

637
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:05,619
I'm so lucky to have you.

638
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:16,931
- Dais?
- No.

639
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,000
No.

640
01:22:20,002 --> 01:22:21,635
Maggie, what happened?

641
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:25,973
--Maggie!

642
01:22:27,343 --> 01:22:30,144
Maggie! Snap out of it!
Maggie! Snap out of it!

643
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,715
--Come on!

644
01:22:34,717 --> 01:22:37,351
Come on, don't do this!

645
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:41,422
Not yet. Maggie?

646
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,992
Snap out of it. Come on.

647
01:22:44,994 --> 01:22:47,394
Daddy?

648
01:22:47,396 --> 01:22:50,731
Daddy?

649
01:22:50,733 --> 01:22:54,168
That's my girl.

650
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:56,403
- That's my baby.
- Daddy.
