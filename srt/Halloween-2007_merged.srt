Come on, sweetie pie.

00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:12,242
Morning, Elvis.
You're a pretty Elvis, aren't you?

4
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,617
Yes, you are.

5
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:17,282
Yes, you are.

6
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:20,815
Jesus Christ, Ronnie, you know
I have to fucking work tonight.

7
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:22,552
Somebody around here
has got to make some money.

8
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:25,757
I'm all broken up here, bitch.
I can't work.

9
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,199
- Yeah, and whose fault is that?
- Fuck you.

10
00:01:28,268 --> 00:01:30,532
Oh, my God, you're pathetic.

11
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:32,799
You know that new waitress
over at the Bingo Lounge?

12
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:35,103
She's been giving me the freaky eye.

13
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:37,575
Oh, the whore with the big tits
hanging down to her knees?

14
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:38,838
Maybe I'll choke the chicken,

purge my snorkel
all over them flappy-ass tits.

Good. Well, have
a good fucking time.

17
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:44,078
- I will.
- I hope she likes cripples.

Bitch, I will crawl over there,
and I will skull fuck the shit outta you!

That's all that fucker does is cry.

Waah! Waah!

24
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:02,329

Just like you.
That's all you do is cry and shit.

Can't you see I'm making eggs over here?

30
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:22,821
I'll pass.

31
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:23,947

32
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:27,357
Since now. They're chicken abortions,
and they're fucking gross.

33
00:02:27,427 --> 00:02:29,258
They are not chicken abortions.

34
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,024

You know what, can you please
go upstairs and get your brother?

36
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:36,662
Why do I always have to do it?

37
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:37,930
Just do it!

a nice little dumper.

- You heard me.

No, say it again, Ronnie!
Say it to my face!

Aaaahhh!

Let me tell you something.

That freak of yours,
he needs some serious discipline.

I mean, he runs around like a little bitch.

57
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,720
You leave him alone.
Keep your hands off him.

58
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:32,019
Give me a fucking break.
He's probably a queer.

59

end up cutting his dick and balls off

You were there. He was like,
"I'm not gonna fight you." I was like--

Yes!

87

I heard your sister got caught
selling blow jobs in the bathroom.

Shut up.

and let me suck her tits?

- Shut up! Shut up!
- Don't fucking yell in my face, you bitch!

120
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,056
I do not enjoy calling you down here
every five minutes.

121
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:23,425
Really?
It sure seems like you fucking do.

122
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:25,589
Can't you get control
over your school, principal?

123
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:28,930
Yes, I can get control.
I can control my school.

124
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:31,800
There's something you gotta know.

125
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,537
Will you just relax a moment?
Please sit down and let me talk to you.

126
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:42,808
- Please. Please.
- Okay. What?

127
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:44,941
Please, sit down.

- Thank God.
- Hi, Jim. How are you?

129
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:48,945
Is this her?

130
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,787
Miss Myers, this is Dr. Loomis.
I took the liberty of calling him in.

131
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,321
- Happens to be a child psychologist--
- Thank you, Jim.

132
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:57,693
Psychologist?

133
00:06:57,764 --> 00:06:59,095
May I ask you,

134
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:02,498
has your son ever had any kind
of serious psychiatric evaluation?

135
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:05,037
Okay, I've had enough.
This is crazy.

136
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:06,766
- Miss Myers, please.
- I gotta get back to work.

137
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,307
- I gotta go.
- Please, ma'am.

138
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:11,138
We only want the best for the child.
Please don't take offense.

139
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:12,803
Please, sit down. Sit down.

140
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,903
Thank you.

141
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,642
Look, uh, Miss Myers...

142
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:18,377
we found this...

143
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:20,248
in Michael's school bag.

144
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:24,656
Come on. Big deal.
He found a dead cat.

145
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,057
And these.

146
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:30,619
What is that?

147
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:32,858
I hope you're not squeamish, Mrs. Myers.

148
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:36,231
Oh, God.

149
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:38,270
Oh, this is really sick.

150
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,199
Are you saying Michael did this?

151
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:45,301
Michael loves animals. He--

152
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:49,514
Why would he do this?

153
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:55,077
Mrs. Myers, typically the thrill of hurting
or causing pain to smaller creatures,

154
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:57,589
it's often an early warning sign.

155
00:07:57,657 --> 00:07:59,215
Early warning sign for what?

156
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:04,056
For much deeper and bigger problems.

157
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,462
[Mrs. Myers] What do you mean problems?
What is this?

158
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,195
[Loomis]
He's a very disturbed young man.

159
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:13,103
I have to evaluate him,
and I'd like to interview him.

160
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:16,074
I need to take him
through a series of tests.

161
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:17,769
[Mrs. Myers] Well, you can talk to him,
but what does--

162
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:19,573
what does evaluating him--
what does that mean?

163
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:23,742
[Loomis] Obviously, he's a very deranged
young mind that can do this to his pets.

164
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,785
[Mrs. Myers]
You don't know that he did that.

165
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:31,487
Fuck, man, if I get one more fucking detention,
I'll be fucking expelled.

166
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:32,957
My old man's gonna beat my ass.

167
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:36,018
We gotta get that piece of shit
on the weekend so we don't get in trouble.

168
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,120
Dude, if I see that Myers pussy,
he's fucking dead.

169
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,069
You want it?

170
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:56,672
Huh? Do you want it?

171
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:37,787
Aah!

172
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:39,381
Ow!

173
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:43,827
What the fuck?

174
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:46,661

00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:48,148
...like my best friend.

528
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:53,295
It just shows you how fucked up my life is.

529
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:58,833
I've done all I possibly can for you.

530
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:02,634
So I'm sorry to tell you

531
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:05,335
that this is going to be my last day.

532
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:07,536
Michael...

533
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:08,942
I have to move on.

534

I'm sorry.

535
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,934
Take care, Michael.

536
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:35,865
Take care.

537
00:41:58,663 --> 00:42:01,029
These eyes will deceive you.

538
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:06,268
They will destroy you.

539
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:10,034
They will take from you your innocence...

540
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:12,337
your pride...

541
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,538
and eventually your soul.

542
00:42:15,613 --> 00:42:20,778
These eyes do not see
what you and I see.

543
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:27,818
Behind these eyes
one finds only blackness,

544
00:42:27,892 --> 00:42:30,884
the absence of light.

545
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:35,160
These are the eyes...

546
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:37,895
of a psychopath.

547
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:39,869

548
00:42:39,937 --> 00:42:42,132

552
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,646
Thus creating a psychopath

553
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,450

554
00:42:58,522 --> 00:43:01,548

my favorite watering hole

559

I'll fuckin' hold it against you.

00:43:18,075 --> 00:43:20,270
Hey, you know what? I'll fuck her.
You don't want to fuck her?

562
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:22,369

Okay, that is so not funny.

705
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:51,200
Want a screwdriver, Mommy?
You want a hammer?

706
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:52,832
Look at this, Mom. Oh!

707
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:54,700
- Laurie, stop!
- I'm sorry. Okay.

708
00:54:54,771 --> 00:54:57,331
- Are you eating?
- No, I'll get something at school.

709
00:54:57,407 --> 00:54:59,102
- Oh, my God.
- [Dad] Oh, sure.

710
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:02,441
Just let the faceless marauding
corporate monsters of America

711
00:55:02,512 --> 00:55:04,207
destroy everything
beautiful about this town.

712
00:55:04,281 --> 00:55:07,614
Corporate monsters or not,
Epic Mart's a lot cheaper.

713
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:09,845
Oh, man, I gotta get out of here.

714
00:55:13,757 --> 00:55:16,749
- Thanks again for dropping that thing off.
- No sweat, Dad.

715
00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:19,387
Just shove the envelope
inside the mail slot, okay?

716
00:55:19,463 --> 00:55:20,691
Yeah, Dad, I know.

717
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:22,254
They're coming by to look at it later, honey.

718
00:55:22,332 --> 00:55:23,321
- So, it's very important that--
- Dad, okay.

719
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,630
I understand.
<i>Muy importante.</i>

720
00:55:25,702 --> 00:55:26,760
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

721
00:55:26,837 --> 00:55:27,929
Have a good day.

722
00:55:28,005 --> 00:55:31,771
Mason, you forgot your briefcase, honey.

723
00:55:31,842 --> 00:55:34,003
- Ah, shit.
- Ah, shit.

724
00:55:34,077 --> 00:55:35,510
I feel like "What round is it?"

725
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:39,374
Yeah.

726
00:55:39,449 --> 00:55:43,442
Oh, uh, you think you could...
glue Mr. Bones' arms on or something?

727
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,853
- Have a good day, baby.
- Yeah. Top on my priority list.

728
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:51,383
Hey, Laurie!

729
00:55:51,461 --> 00:55:52,519
- Wait up!
- Oh, God.

730
00:55:52,596 --> 00:55:55,497
- Leave me alone, Tommy.
- Wait.

731
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:58,534
Definition: Stop walking.

732
00:55:58,602 --> 00:56:01,969
- Can I ask you something serious?
- Sure, why not?

733
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:04,405
Did you ever hear
about the Mexican Wolf Man?

734
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:06,533
- No.
- Yeah, well, he's real.

735
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,134
- I saw him on TV last night...
- Yeah.

736
00:56:08,211 --> 00:56:11,977
And his name's Danny, and his face
is completely covered with hair.

737
00:56:12,049 --> 00:56:13,744
And he likes soccer.
I swear it! They showed--

738
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:14,875
- Okay.
- He's a wolf!

739
00:56:14,951 --> 00:56:17,215
Tommy, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

740
00:56:17,287 --> 00:56:18,652
Lay off the candy corn, kid.

741
00:56:18,722 --> 00:56:21,247
Stop acting like I'm crazy. It's true!

742
00:56:21,324 --> 00:56:23,349
Tommy, I'm your babysitter.
You're crazy.

743
00:56:23,427 --> 00:56:25,918
- I know this. You're crazy.
- Ooohhh!

744
00:57:51,948 --> 00:57:54,212
[Laurie]
All right, gotta make a stop here.

745
00:57:54,284 --> 00:57:57,481
[Tommy]
Whoa! What are you, insane?

746
00:57:57,554 --> 00:57:59,988
Oh, my gosh, Tommy,
I'm not even listening to you.

747
00:58:00,056 --> 00:58:02,081
You'd better listen to me.

748
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:03,353
He's right there.

749
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:05,519
What are you, crazy?
You can't go in there.

750
00:58:05,595 --> 00:58:07,290
Oh, yes, I can.

751
00:58:07,364 --> 00:58:09,594
Hold my books, please?

752
00:58:11,034 --> 00:58:13,594
That's the devil's house.
The Boogey Man lives in there.

753
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:15,729
Yeah.
Oh, no, Tommy.

754
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:17,899
Don't even joke about it.
I'm serious.

755
00:58:17,974 --> 00:58:20,067
Oh, you're scaring me.

756
00:58:20,143 --> 00:58:23,374
The Boogey Man will get me
or Danny the Wolf Man.

757
00:58:29,886 --> 00:58:31,513
Oh, no, Tommy.

758
00:58:31,588 --> 00:58:34,352
Oh, no!

759
00:58:34,424 --> 00:58:36,051
Oh, no, it's pulling me--

760
00:58:36,126 --> 00:58:38,617
Oh, no, Tommy, it's pulling me in!

761
00:58:38,695 --> 00:58:40,629
Ha ha ha.

762
00:58:41,331 --> 00:58:42,798
It was just a joke. Chill.

763
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:44,766
I wish it wasn't.

764
00:58:44,835 --> 00:58:46,666
Come on, hurry up.

765
00:58:46,736 --> 00:58:48,931
Chill, spazz-monkey.

766
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:50,199
Thanks.

767
00:58:53,276 --> 00:58:55,244
That's no place to screw around,
Laurie.

768
00:58:55,312 --> 00:58:57,837
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?

769
00:58:57,914 --> 00:59:00,075
Do you know whose house that is?

770
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:01,447
Come on.

771
00:59:01,518 --> 00:59:03,611
- It's going to be fine.
- Yeah.

772
00:59:03,687 --> 00:59:05,120
What if something happens?

773
00:59:05,188 --> 00:59:07,952
- Laurie, what is going to happen?
- I don't know.

774
00:59:08,024 --> 00:59:09,685
It's going to be fine.

775
00:59:09,759 --> 00:59:11,989
What is going to be fine?

776
00:59:12,062 --> 00:59:15,395
Annie wants me to pretend
to baby-sit Lindsey Wallace,

777
00:59:15,465 --> 00:59:19,026
then sneak out and dump her with me
so she can go and see Paul.

778
00:59:19,102 --> 00:59:20,467
Sounds like
one of my crafty ideas.

779
00:59:20,537 --> 00:59:21,765
- Yeah.
- I like it.

780
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:24,705
Anyway, I thought Paul was, like, grounded
for trashing his dad's motorcycle.

781
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:26,765
Oh, yeah.
No, he was, but he got out of it.

782
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:28,105
- You know.
- Yeah.

783
00:59:28,178 --> 00:59:30,442
Please?

784
00:59:30,513 --> 00:59:31,878
What if they come home early?

785
00:59:31,948 --> 00:59:34,610
Dude, they are not
going to come home early.

786
00:59:34,684 --> 00:59:36,481
Okay? Mrs. Wallace is a lush.

787
00:59:36,553 --> 00:59:39,545
They're going to be out all night
getting hammered.

788
00:59:39,623 --> 00:59:42,490
Yeah. Annie, I really hate lying.
You know that.

789
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,119
God, what are you, Mother Teresa?

790
00:59:45,195 --> 00:59:46,526
- No.
- Yes, she is.

791
00:59:46,596 --> 00:59:48,223
Look at her.
She's like a little angel.

792
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:52,132
- She's Mother-fucking Teresa.
- Stop. I am not!

793
00:59:52,202 --> 00:59:53,692
Please?

794
00:59:56,473 --> 00:59:58,407
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes!

795
00:59:58,475 --> 00:59:59,669
You owe me big time.

796
00:59:59,743 --> 01:00:01,677
- I love you.
- I love you.

797
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:07,780
Did you know that ethyl alcohol
boils at 78.5 degrees Celsius?

798
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:09,318
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

799
01:00:09,386 --> 01:00:10,853
That's pretty cool, right?

800
01:00:11,855 --> 01:00:12,947
Call me back.

801
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:18,190
This is all your fault.

802
01:00:18,261 --> 01:00:20,092
I mean, you're responsible.

803
01:00:21,531 --> 01:00:26,559
I cannot be responsible
for everything that goes on in here.

804
01:00:26,636 --> 01:00:28,103
- What about you?
- No, no, no, no.

805
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:30,139
You're not pinning this on me.

806
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:33,903
- He was your patient, Doctor.
- Was my patient.

807
01:00:33,977 --> 01:00:37,435
Look, all you guys had to do
was to play zoo-keeper.

808
01:00:37,514 --> 01:00:40,972
Just keep the monkeyhouse locked
until the monkey died of old age.

809
01:00:41,051 --> 01:00:42,518
How difficult is that?

810
01:00:42,585 --> 01:00:46,419
Christ, you can barely tell
he's breathing half the time.

811
01:00:46,489 --> 01:00:50,289
He's been like a comatose kitty
for 15 years.

812
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,193
If our security wasn't sufficient, Sammy,

813
01:00:53,263 --> 01:00:55,060
you should have warned us.

814
01:00:55,131 --> 01:00:59,397
I see. So you're just going
to wash your hands of the whole thing.

815
01:00:59,469 --> 01:01:02,302
You know, you two make me sick.

816
01:01:10,447 --> 01:01:14,781
"He is mad that trusts
in the tameness of a wolf."

817
01:01:16,486 --> 01:01:19,114
We've given the authorities
his complete profile.

818
01:01:19,189 --> 01:01:22,681
Two road blocks and an all-points bulletin
wouldn't stop a 5-year-old.

819
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:24,420
Well, what do you want us to do?

820
01:01:24,494 --> 01:01:26,485
Yes. I mean,
what do you want us to do?

821
01:01:27,964 --> 01:01:29,932
I want you to get on the phone,

822
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,697
and I want you to tell them
who broke out of here last night.

823
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:37,228
And I want you to tell them
exactly where he's going.

824
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:38,774
Christ, we don't know where he's going.

825
01:01:38,842 --> 01:01:40,935
It must be great living in denial.

826
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:42,603
I must try it sometime.

827
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:46,376
Look, you and that army
of shirt-tuckers up there,

828
01:01:46,449 --> 01:01:48,417
you know damn well where he's going.

829
01:01:50,186 --> 01:01:51,210
And where is that?

830
01:01:54,591 --> 01:01:56,422
Haddonfield!

831
01:01:56,493 --> 01:01:59,257
Haddonfield's a hundred miles
away from here.

832
01:01:59,329 --> 01:02:00,455
[School bell rings]

833
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:01,792
This is so fucked.

834
01:02:01,865 --> 01:02:03,992
What, me suspended from the squad?

835
01:02:04,067 --> 01:02:05,261
I don't mean to sound conceited,

836
01:02:05,335 --> 01:02:07,496
but I'm, like, the fucking hottest
cheerleader they've got.

837
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:09,299
Yeah, Lynda,
that doesn't sound conceited.

838
01:02:09,372 --> 01:02:11,272
What, so now nobody
can take a joke anymore?

839
01:02:11,341 --> 01:02:12,968
- What did you say?
- Check it.

840
01:02:13,043 --> 01:02:15,637
So Lady Fuck-face gives us
three new cheers to learn,

841
01:02:15,712 --> 01:02:19,671
so I'm like, "Hey, why don't we just
rock it commando, flash some snatch?

842
01:02:19,749 --> 01:02:21,808
And maybe nobody will notice
we're doing the same old tired cheers."

843
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:23,819
- Oh, you didn't.
- Oh, yeah, I did.

844
01:02:23,887 --> 01:02:24,876
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah.

845
01:02:24,954 --> 01:02:26,649
You know what that
dried-up fucking bitch did?

846
01:02:26,723 --> 01:02:29,419
- What?
- Calls my dad and tells him what I said.

847
01:02:29,492 --> 01:02:30,481
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

848
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,791
That C-U-N-T, yeah,
needs to get laid.

849
01:02:33,863 --> 01:02:35,490
What did your dad say?

850
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:36,793
Oh, who cares?

851
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:40,632
I'll just give him the little sweetie-pants
princess suck-up routine.

852
01:02:40,703 --> 01:02:43,934
Daddy's little pookie would never
say something like that.

853
01:02:44,007 --> 01:02:45,770
Gosh, ever since your parents split up,

854
01:02:45,842 --> 01:02:47,901
you have your dad
wrapped around your little finger.

855
01:02:47,977 --> 01:02:50,207
Totally wrapped.

856
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,805
- Hey, bitches!
- Hey, Annie.

857
01:02:52,882 --> 01:02:56,545
- Thanks for waiting for me.
- Whatever. Hurry your ass up.

858
01:02:56,619 --> 01:02:58,348
God.

859
01:02:58,421 --> 01:03:01,652
Hey, I heard about your
little cheerleading incident.

860
01:03:01,724 --> 01:03:03,954
Yeah, I'm totally famous.

861
01:03:04,027 --> 01:03:05,654
You're totally a slut.

862
01:03:05,728 --> 01:03:07,252
Yeah.
[Laughs]

863
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,161
Anyway, today in class,
in French class,

864
01:03:09,232 --> 01:03:11,200
Mr. Leclerc was totally
flirting with me.

865
01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:15,169
- God, here we go!
- We were conjugating the verb "to want."

866
01:03:15,238 --> 01:03:19,004
- Because he so wants you!
- <i>Je veuxl Je veuxl</i>

867
01:03:19,075 --> 01:03:21,873
- Oh, my gosh.
- Bare Leclerc.

868
01:03:21,945 --> 01:03:23,572
Bare Leclerc wants me.

869
01:03:23,646 --> 01:03:25,546
I think that guy's watching us.

870
01:03:25,615 --> 01:03:27,276
- What guy?
- That guy over there.

871
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:28,442
Yeah?

872
01:03:28,518 --> 01:03:30,315
- Oh, please.
- I saw him outside school earlier.

873
01:03:30,386 --> 01:03:32,411
Probably just some pervert
cruising school poontang.

874
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:34,548
Yeah, wait. Watch this.

Hey, freak!

Huh? Why don't you go crawl back

881
01:03:46,202 --> 01:03:48,762
- Yeah, whatever.
- See, I told you.

882
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:50,772
He's just some
stupid fucking pervert.

883
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,865
- Total pervert.
- Gosh, you guys are crazy.

884
01:03:52,942 --> 01:03:54,204
That guy could have been dangerous.

885
01:03:54,277 --> 01:03:55,505
- Oh, God.
- Whatever.

886
01:03:55,578 --> 01:03:57,375
- What is he going to do?
- I don't know.

887
01:03:57,447 --> 01:04:00,939
Oh, my God.
You should date him!

888
01:04:02,385 --> 01:04:04,319

What's up, Dad?

896
01:04:16,332 --> 01:04:19,028
I'm on my way home.
Anybody want a ride?

Hey, kiddo.

903
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:34,782
- Kind of a drag having a pig as a dad.
- Nah, I like him.

904
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:37,319
Yeah? Do you think
he was flirting with me?

905
01:04:37,387 --> 01:04:39,218
- You are so demented.
- Totally.

906
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:41,587

Aw, how cute.

909
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:29,931
Would you please help me
with this stupid thing?

910
01:05:30,006 --> 01:05:31,837
Okay, okay, okay.

911
01:05:31,908 --> 01:05:35,002
Jeez. Mom, why do you
deal with this every year?

912
01:05:35,078 --> 01:05:37,137
Because for some unbelievable reason,

913
01:05:37,213 --> 01:05:39,977
your father likes it.

914
01:05:40,049 --> 01:05:42,074
- The feet look like the hands--
- It's not working.

915
01:05:42,151 --> 01:05:45,348
And the hands like the feet,
and I can't get the thing in the hole, and--

916
01:05:45,421 --> 01:05:48,447
- Oh, I can't get it!
- Calm down, I'm helping--

917
01:05:48,524 --> 01:05:49,889
Oh, I got it.

918
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:52,928
- You got it?
- Will you try and get those right?

919
01:05:52,996 --> 01:05:54,463
Okay, I'll try.

920
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:55,690
Oh, jeez.

921
01:05:55,765 --> 01:05:58,928
I've been out here
for two hours doing this.

922
01:05:59,002 --> 01:06:00,970
There.

923
01:06:01,104 --> 01:06:03,504
- Hey, do you want me to get--
- Just hang himself. No!

924
01:06:03,573 --> 01:06:06,303
I'm still upset about the whole
bagel thing this morning,

925
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:07,365
if you want to know the truth.

926
01:06:07,443 --> 01:06:08,603
Mom, that was a joke.

927
01:06:08,678 --> 01:06:10,043
- Oh, yeah. Well, let me tell you.
- It was a joke.

928
01:06:10,113 --> 01:06:11,978
There are some things
moms don't need to hear.

929
01:06:12,048 --> 01:06:13,640

Yeah. Hello? He--

Oh, sh-- ugh!
Can I borrow your cell phone?

936
01:06:38,241 --> 01:06:40,801
This thing's about as useful
as a row of Christmas puddings.

Oh, no. I don't have one.

Oh, yeah. Right.

940
01:06:46,449 --> 01:06:49,816
You know, I remember this mess
just like it happened yesterday?

941
01:06:49,886 --> 01:06:51,251
It was tragic.

942
01:06:51,321 --> 01:06:53,118
The poor woman,
I guess she couldn't stand the stress

943
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:56,124
of being labeled "Satan's mother."

944
01:06:56,192 --> 01:06:58,626
I think she blew her fucking head off.

945
01:06:58,695 --> 01:07:00,526
I'm still amazed.

I think he wrote a book or something.

Fucking blood money.

949
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:11,435
Yeah, I read that book.
It was a masterpiece.

Jesus Christ!

953

Don't they think I have anything better to do
with my time than clean up this shit?

954
01:07:24,454 --> 01:07:26,445
Fucking little idiots! God damn it!

955
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:28,183

Yeah, with like, your $10 you have
in your piggy bank?

962

It's a shithole anyway.

Don't worry, dude.

965
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:25,845
We'll find another house to party in.

Besides, I'm gonna
get the van all jacked up.

All right, I'll go.

983
01:09:32,248 --> 01:09:36,878
So, seriously, on a scale from 1 to 10,
should I have a 5?

984
01:09:36,953 --> 01:09:41,356
How about... zero?

985
01:09:41,424 --> 01:09:42,584
- More like--
- Zero.

986

- Oh, Happy Halloween.
- You, too.

1042
01:14:16,932 --> 01:14:19,594
- Bye, you guys.
- Thank you. Bye.

1043
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:22,967
So cute.

1044
01:14:23,038 --> 01:14:25,632
I cannot believe you're graduating this year.

1045
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:28,438
I remember when you used
to run around looking like that.

1046
01:14:28,511 --> 01:14:30,445
Mom, I was never a princess.

1047
01:14:30,513 --> 01:14:32,777
Last thing I was at their age
was dead Little Red Riding Hood.

1048
01:14:32,848 --> 01:14:34,145
You were this beautiful ballerina--

1049
01:14:34,216 --> 01:14:36,980
No, you bought me the blood
and you gave me the cuts.

1050
01:14:37,052 --> 01:14:38,417
"My costume's too tight."

1051
01:14:38,487 --> 01:14:40,079
- You don't remember that?
- I never wore a tutu.

1052
01:14:40,156 --> 01:14:41,885
You getting many kids?

1053
01:14:41,957 --> 01:14:44,824
Only two so far.

1054
01:14:44,894 --> 01:14:47,328
Listen...

1055
01:14:47,396 --> 01:14:48,385
be careful tonight.

1056
01:14:48,464 --> 01:14:49,453
I know.

1057
01:14:49,532 --> 01:14:51,932
A lot of nut cases come out on Halloween.

1058
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:55,198
It's, uh--
What was it you told me to say?

1059
01:14:56,672 --> 01:14:59,334
- Amateur night.
- Yeah, that's right. Amateur night.

1060
01:14:59,408 --> 01:15:01,535
Dad, I'm just going to be babysitting.

1061
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:03,202
- What's the worst thing I could do?
- All right, okay.

1062
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:04,974
- I'm just saying.
- Nice.

1063
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:06,071
- All right.
- Sorry.

1064
01:15:06,148 --> 01:15:07,706
- Aah!
- Mom, st--

1065
01:15:11,987 --> 01:15:13,716
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Strode!

1066
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:14,915
- Hey, Annie.
- Hey.

1067
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:16,048
How's your dad?

1068
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:18,719
Oh, you know, same as always.

1069
01:15:18,794 --> 01:15:20,989
- You know what that means?
- Mm-hmm.

1070
01:15:22,665 --> 01:15:24,132
Yeah. Love you guys!

1071
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,532
- Love you, too!
- Bye-bye!

1072
01:15:26,602 --> 01:15:27,864
Gonna give me some lovin'?

1073
01:15:27,937 --> 01:15:32,237
I'll give you some lovin' later, but first
you're going to talk about the vacation.

1074
01:15:32,308 --> 01:15:35,675
I'm going to go build a fire.

1075
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:37,439
Vacation.

1076
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
I hate vacation. Let's stay home.

1077
01:16:12,348 --> 01:16:13,645
Aaahhh!

1078
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:42,600
No! No!

1079
01:16:42,678 --> 01:16:45,943
You leave my baby alone, you--

1080
01:16:59,361 --> 01:17:01,056
[crack]

1081
01:17:06,035 --> 01:17:08,503
Okay, Tommy,
here's your jelly sandwich,

hold the peanut butter.

1083
01:17:10,673 --> 01:17:11,901
Good.

1084
01:17:11,974 --> 01:17:13,874
You know, if you listened to me
the first time,

1085
01:17:13,943 --> 01:17:15,433
you wouldn't had to have made it twice.

1086
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:21,149
- Laurie?
- What?

1087
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:23,851
Is the Boogey Man real?

1088
01:17:23,919 --> 01:17:26,217
Why are you so obsessed
with the Boogey Man, Tommy?

1089
01:17:26,288 --> 01:17:29,587
- Well, I hear things at school.
- Like what?

1090
01:17:29,658 --> 01:17:32,388
Well, I heard that on Halloween night,

1091
01:17:32,461 --> 01:17:35,919
the Boogey Man sneaks out
and attacks kids who don't believe.

1092
01:17:37,766 --> 01:17:39,791
You know what, Tommy?

1093
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:41,836
It is true.

1094
01:17:41,904 --> 01:17:44,566
He likes to eat little boys like you.

1095
01:17:46,642 --> 01:17:48,234
Oh, my God!
The Boogey Man's here!

1096
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:50,005
We're going to die!

1097
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:51,410
[Telephone rings]

1098
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,038
Hold that thought.

1099
01:17:53,115 --> 01:17:55,310
That's not appropriate
babysitter behavior, Laurie.

1100
01:17:55,384 --> 01:17:56,612
Hello?

1101
01:17:57,319 --> 01:17:58,752
<i>[Laurie]</i>
<i>Shut up.</i>

1102
01:17:58,821 --> 01:18:01,654
- <i>My parents will hear about this one.</i>
- Yo, it's me. Hey.

1103
01:18:01,724 --> 01:18:04,022
So the Wallaces are finally out of my face.

1104
01:18:04,093 --> 01:18:05,685
I just talked to Paul.
He's on his way over.

1105
01:18:05,761 --> 01:18:11,256
So I'm finishing making the Queen of Sheba
her popcorn, and then I will be over.

1106
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:14,461
I have some fun and exciting news for you,
so I'll see you in a few minutes.

1107
01:18:14,536 --> 01:18:15,969
Okay, bye.

1108
01:18:17,706 --> 01:18:20,038
- Guess what, Tommy.
- What?

1109
01:18:20,109 --> 01:18:22,600
Lindsey Wallace is coming over.

1110
01:18:22,678 --> 01:18:24,703
What? She can't come over here!

1111
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:27,578
- What if the guys see her?
- So?

1112
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:29,116
One, she's a girl.

1113
01:18:29,184 --> 01:18:31,311
Two, she's not a boy.

1114
01:18:31,387 --> 01:18:33,048
And three, she smells like you.

1115
01:18:33,122 --> 01:18:36,523
This is going to be a long night.

1116
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:37,923
For the both of us.

1117
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:39,916
- Don't start with me.
- Uh, uh.

1118
01:18:39,995 --> 01:18:42,020
What's the matter with you?

1119
01:19:08,657 --> 01:19:11,455
Lindsey... get your coat on.

1120
01:19:11,527 --> 01:19:13,461
We're going to go over
and see Tommy Doyal.

1121
01:19:13,529 --> 01:19:15,292
Okay.

1122
01:19:22,771 --> 01:19:25,706
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1123
01:19:25,774 --> 01:19:28,106
Yeah, exactly.
I said get your coat on.

1124
01:19:28,177 --> 01:19:32,238
We're going over to your late-night lover
Tommy Doyal's house.

1125
01:19:32,314 --> 01:19:33,440
No, you didn't.

1126
01:19:33,515 --> 01:19:34,777
Yes, I did.

1127
01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:36,841
No, you didn't.

1128
01:19:36,919 --> 01:19:41,356
Don, I'm sorry if I don't
sound too concerned,

1129
01:19:41,423 --> 01:19:45,519
but a dead coyote and a missing headstone
doesn't prove anything.

1130
01:19:45,594 --> 01:19:46,618
Well, I think you're wrong, Sheriff.

1131
01:19:46,695 --> 01:19:49,391
I think it does prove
that he's here in Haddonfield.

1132
01:19:49,465 --> 01:19:52,025
It was a Halloween prank.

1133
01:19:52,101 --> 01:19:54,399
Kids pull shit like that all the time.

1134
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:55,994
The stone will be returned tomorrow.

1135
01:19:56,071 --> 01:19:58,130
And besides, it weighs over half a ton.

1136
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:00,675
That's my point exactly.

1137
01:20:00,742 --> 01:20:04,678
So you're saying that one man picked it up
and walked away with it?

1138
01:20:04,746 --> 01:20:05,872
Yes.

1139
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:08,644
Doc, I may have been born,
but I wasn't born yesterday.

1140
01:20:08,717 --> 01:20:11,982
I'm sorry, Sheriff,
but please listen to me.

1141
01:20:12,054 --> 01:20:14,284
This may be a matter of life and death.

1142
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:17,484
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1143
01:20:17,559 --> 01:20:19,356
You come by my office tomorrow--

1144
01:20:19,428 --> 01:20:21,862
Tomorrow is too late.

1145
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:24,194
Evil is here.

1146
01:20:24,266 --> 01:20:26,097
It's walking amongst us.

1147
01:20:26,168 --> 01:20:29,160
Doc, it sounds to me like
you're talking about the Antichrist.

1148
01:20:29,238 --> 01:20:31,798
Well, perhaps I am.

1149
01:20:31,874 --> 01:20:32,863
Smell my feet

1150
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:34,602
Give me something good to eat

1151
01:20:34,676 --> 01:20:36,473
If you don't, I don't care

1152
01:20:36,545 --> 01:20:38,479
I'll pull down Annie's underwear

1153
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:41,675
I can't believe you're making me
haul this thing all the way over there.

1154
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:45,186
I can't believe you think
I'm not going to tell.

1155
01:20:46,288 --> 01:20:49,121
Gonna share some popcorn
with your little boyfriend?

1156
01:20:49,191 --> 01:20:51,056
No, I'm not.

1157
01:20:51,126 --> 01:20:52,650
You know you are.

1158
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:55,390
You know you're going
to share something with Paul.

1159
01:20:55,464 --> 01:20:57,659
You know how annoying you are?

1160
01:20:57,733 --> 01:20:59,598
How?

1161
01:20:59,668 --> 01:21:01,727
Trick or treat, smell my feet.

1162
01:21:01,803 --> 01:21:03,532

- I swear to God, Lindsey.

we're going to have
a pumpkin-smashing party

Tommy, where's your girlfriend Laurie?

1169
01:21:23,025 --> 01:21:25,391
Laurie's not my girlfriend.
I hate girls.

1170
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:27,655
Why doesn't anyone understand this?

1171
01:21:27,729 --> 01:21:29,321
Good. So does Lindsey.

1172
01:21:29,398 --> 01:21:31,093
Go worship your god.

01:21:31,166 --> 01:21:33,566
- Hey.
- Brought you a present.

01:21:33,635 --> 01:21:35,262
Thanks.

1175
01:21:35,337 --> 01:21:38,431
You, my dear, will be happy to know

1176
01:21:38,507 --> 01:21:41,476
that I talked to Paul
about his buddy Ben Tramer.

1177
01:21:41,543 --> 01:21:44,034
Oh, I thought you said
Ben Tramer was retarded.

1178
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:48,242
Yeah, but he's not
<i>Shortbus</i> retarded or anything.

1179
01:21:48,317 --> 01:21:49,375
What? He's okay.

1180
01:21:49,451 --> 01:21:53,080
- I mean, you need a boyfriend!
- Annie, I don't need a boyfriend.

1181
01:21:53,155 --> 01:21:54,486
- No, that's not what I meant.
- I'm fine.

- Okay, Annie--

I need a boyfriend.

1189
01:22:06,001 --> 01:22:08,936
He said, and I quote,

1190
01:22:09,004 --> 01:22:12,462
"Dude, she's fucking hot."

Good.

1200
01:22:36,765 --> 01:22:40,724
You have to stop thinking
that we're dealing with a normal man here.

1201
01:22:40,802 --> 01:22:44,067
We're dealing with
a soulless killing machine,

1202
01:22:44,139 --> 01:22:46,767
driven by pure animal instinct.

1203
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:51,912
Dr. Loomis, I'm going
to have to level with you.

1204

I read your book.

I know exactly who you are,
and frankly, I don't like you.

And I'll tell you something else.

1207
01:22:58,687 --> 01:23:02,350
I think you have created
quite the masterpiece of a monster

01:23:02,424 --> 01:23:07,828
off the blood of this town,
because monsters sell books.

on the cover of the book.

All right.

1211
01:23:15,437 --> 01:23:18,873
I first met Michael 17 years ago.

1212
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:24,503
When I first met him,
he was a sweet, charming little boy.

1213
01:23:24,579 --> 01:23:28,276
But he had nothing inside.

1214
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:30,978
There was something missing, a void.

1215
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:34,614
There was no conscience, no reason,

1216
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:40,287
even a rudimentary sense
of life or death, right or wrong.

1217
01:23:40,362 --> 01:23:44,128
Yeah. He's come back for her.

1218
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:48,568
And who is her?

1219
01:23:48,637 --> 01:23:52,198
He's come back for his baby sister.

1220
01:23:52,274 --> 01:23:55,072
I know it in my bones, Sheriff.

1221
01:23:56,645 --> 01:23:57,976
To do what?

1222
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:03,780
I don't know, Sheriff, but...

1223
01:24:05,153 --> 01:24:07,383
it's not good.

1224
01:24:11,426 --> 01:24:15,328
If I break a promise I made a long time ago,

1225
01:24:15,397 --> 01:24:18,833
then you must promise that you will play it

1226
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:22,563

- Laurie?
- What, Tommy?

1239
01:25:00,976 --> 01:25:05,436
I would like to return to the subject
we started earlier this evening.

1240
01:25:05,514 --> 01:25:07,038
What? Your hatred of peanut butter?

1241
01:25:07,115 --> 01:25:09,276
No, the Boogey Man.

1242
01:25:09,351 --> 01:25:11,512
I need some closure on this topic.

1243
01:25:11,586 --> 01:25:13,110
I've heard all about this.

1244
01:25:13,188 --> 01:25:15,588
What do you want to know, Tommy?

1245
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:17,955
Why would he only attack kids
who don't believe?

1246
01:25:18,026 --> 01:25:20,153
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

1247
01:25:20,228 --> 01:25:22,822
Is it because if you believe,
then you're protected by his powers?

1248
01:25:22,898 --> 01:25:24,832
Okay, Tommy,
enough about the Boogey Man.

1249
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:25,958
It's nonsense.

1250
01:25:26,034 --> 01:25:28,764
I'm with Tommy on this one.

1251
01:25:28,837 --> 01:25:32,830
Yeah. Why do you keep
avoiding the subject, Laurie?

1252
01:25:32,908 --> 01:25:34,705
Is-- Is she scared?

1253
01:25:34,776 --> 01:25:36,004
- Maybe she is.
- Ooh, yeah.

1254
01:25:36,077 --> 01:25:38,238
- Maybe you're scared!
- Are you scared?

1255
01:25:38,313 --> 01:25:40,008
Okay, stop! Stop!

1256

[Siren wailing]

1292
01:29:01,616 --> 01:29:05,780
About 17 years ago,
I respond to a 911

1293
01:29:05,854 --> 01:29:08,846
which turned out to be
the Myers woman's suicide.

1294
01:29:08,923 --> 01:29:14,020
And I see this beautiful,
innocent baby sitting in this bloody mess,

1295
01:29:14,095 --> 01:29:17,258
and I can't imagine this child growing up
with a stigma around her neck,

1296
01:29:17,832 --> 01:29:23,634
so I omit her from the report,
I drive her to another town,

1297
01:29:23,705 --> 01:29:25,969
and drop her off
at the nearest emergency room.

1298
01:29:26,041 --> 01:29:27,872
And I think that this
is going to be the end of it.

1299
01:29:27,942 --> 01:29:30,809
About three months later,
I find out from a friend of mine,

1300
01:29:30,879 --> 01:29:33,939

that he's adopted the baby.

1301
