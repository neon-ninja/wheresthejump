1
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:32,465
Griffin. Griffin.

2
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:35,707
- Griffin, what did I say?
- I'm in the middle of a game.

3
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:38,293
You can't play that in the car
unless you take your Dramamine.

4
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:40,753
It's too late for Dramamine.
We're practically there.

5
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:43,506
Don't roll your eyes at me.
You want him puking in the car again?

6
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:45,258
- I said I was sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.

7
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:46,676
That was smelly.

8
00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:49,470
- Was not! It was only an accident.
- Nobody's blaming you, honeybun.

9
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,555
It was smelly.

10
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:52,682
- I'm following the GPS.
- It stinked.

11
00:01:52,782 --> 00:01:54,100
Look, she says left on Kitty Hawk.

12
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,268
No, no, Dad.

13
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:57,103
- There's no way we can live here.
- Oh, come on.

14
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:59,564
You haven't even seen the house yet.

15
00:01:59,664 --> 00:02:01,107
- There are power lines.
- Relax.

16
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:04,152
- I can feel the tumors forming already.
- No one's getting tumors.

17
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:07,071
- What tumors?
- It's a joke. Dumbass.

18
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:09,699
- It's a joke, dumbass!
- Don't say that, sweetie.

19
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:12,827
- Make a U-turn in 50 feet.
- What?

20
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:14,662
- You missed the turn?
- Yes, ma'am.

21
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:18,602
Dumbass. Whee!

22
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,286
Come on.

23
00:02:50,423 --> 00:02:51,824
Nice, right?

24
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:52,934
Yeah.

25
00:02:53,426 --> 00:02:54,536
Cozy.

26
00:02:54,636 --> 00:02:55,995
I think it's nice.

27
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:57,830
I think it's nice, too.

28
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,957
Piggy-corn, too.

29
00:02:59,057 --> 00:03:00,208
Mr. and Mrs. Bowen.

30
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:03,888
Hi. Sorry we're late.
We missed that turn on Kitty Hawk.

31
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:06,005
Yeah, modern technology.

32
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:08,716
She's just gonna go right in,
start checking it out.

33
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:09,816
That hoop is cool.

34
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,681
Nice tree, huh?

35
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:17,350
That's been here longer
than any of the houses.

36
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,870
Be fun to climb.

37
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,521
- Mom, there's a kitchen!
- Oh, wow.

38
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:22,855
I'm gonna go see my bedroom!

39
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:24,691
Slow down, please, on the stairs.

40
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,701
That security system works.
The owner was a bit of a technophile,

41
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:30,029
so this house is wired
for whatever you might need.

42
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,459
You'll notice he put speakers
in all of the walls,

43
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:35,217
so you can hear music in every room...
including the john.

44
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:37,745
So, this is the kitchen through here.

45
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:39,873
- Do you wanna see this?
- Sure.

46
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:44,878
- Will either of you two be commuting to work?
- Not me. I'll be home with the kids.

47
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:47,046
- Amy is an amazing writer.
- Oh, Eric!

48
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:48,423
- She is.
- Come on!

49
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:50,550
She's being very humble right now.
She's very good.

50
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,530
I'm trying to be, but you know,
it's just hard to find the time.

51
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:57,223
I know, believe me,
I have two of my own.

52
00:03:57,323 --> 00:03:59,283
They're in college.
I'm glad they're gone.

53
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:02,946
I mean, I'm getting my life back.

54
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:05,732
Where did you say that you worked,
Mr. Bowen?

55
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:08,735
John Deere corporate, over in Moline.

56
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:11,169
That's a wonderful company.
We have a riding mower.

57
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:13,406
It's lasted us for years.
We love John Deere.

58
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:17,535
Well, I'd be very flattered right now
if I hadn't gotten laid off.

59
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:19,204
- I'm sorry. I didn't realize...
- That's all right.

60
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:22,540
They do have a quality... mower.
It's fine.

61
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,583
They do, but...

62
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:25,543
They were making some cutbacks,
and I was...

63
00:04:25,643 --> 00:04:28,213
Hey, Eric, come look at this.

64
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:31,774
I'd love to, but I'm in the middle of a very
awkward exchange with our realtor right now.

65
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:34,427
- Come see.
- Is that all right?

66
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,737
- Don't go anywhere.
- Please.

67
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:39,891
- Look, there's a field down there.
- Oh, hey.

68
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:42,602
- Whose property is that?
- That's city property.

69
00:04:42,702 --> 00:04:45,202
That's a good place for a brushfire.

70
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:48,539
You have to try to like this.

71
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,375
Okay. I'll try.

72
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:54,280
Would you like to see the upstairs?

73
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,710
Yes, I would.

74
00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:58,993
And this is a master
that you're showing us?

75
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:00,553
That's correct.

76
00:05:02,388 --> 00:05:03,623
How is it up there, kiddo?

77
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:04,999
I like our house better.

78
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,086
Well, that's not an option, honey.

79
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:11,089
You can call that a bedroom,
but really, it's an attic.

80
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:13,189
That can be where Griffin sleeps.

81
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,803
This place has so much light.

82
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:18,203
Huh, Eric?

83
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:19,738
Very nice.

84
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:21,307
Yeah.

85
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:22,642
Very nice.

86
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:24,936
The house faces...

87
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:27,814
Yeah, it's a little bit quiet
on this side of the street...

88
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:31,254
but just one block up,
things are starting to fill up.

89
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,749
It's funny. Yeah.

90
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,420
Piggy-corn?

91
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:44,163
No, Piggy-corn's not my baby.

92
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:45,456
She's just a doll.

93
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:47,500
She's half-pig and half-unicorn, see?

94
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,919
She has a little horn. Honk, honk.

95
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:51,769
Who are you talking to?

96
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:55,193
No one.

97
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:58,442
Mom, we like this house!

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

99
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:30,543
Jesus, this is really stuck.

100
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:33,483
That's probably just moisture.
It rained last week.

101
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:39,052
Okay. Well, I don't know.

102
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:41,304
All the houses are like this
in our price range.

103
00:06:41,404 --> 00:06:43,473
And this is the least sucky one
we've seen...

104
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:45,642
- so I think, maybe...
- Maybe?

105
00:06:45,742 --> 00:06:49,854
Okay, look. Foreclosures have
hit this neighborhood really hard.

106
00:06:49,954 --> 00:06:52,124
There's some wiggle room on the price.

107
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:55,499
How much wiggle we talking?

108
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:02,742
Come on, man!

109
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:03,972
Sorry.

110
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:05,912
Perfect.

111
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:07,932
Buck up, kiddo. It's temporary.

112
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:10,625
We've ruined your life.

113
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:11,709
Good.

114
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:13,019
Yay!

115
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:18,518
Hey, hey, hey.

116
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:19,968
Come on.

117
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:21,594
You said you wanted
to get rid of that stuff.

118
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:22,637
What, are you kidding?

119
00:07:22,737 --> 00:07:25,098
This is my old bat bank.
I'm saving it for Griff.

120
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:26,182
Yeah, right.

121
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:28,702
Griff, let's play some catch. Here.

122
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:30,704
Hi-yo, Silver!

123
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:34,871
Yeah! Nice. Team Bowen!

124
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,998
Eric, leave him be.

125
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:39,070
Well, we're bonding.

126
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,238
I don't know that you are.

127
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:41,878
I'll throw you a ball, okay?

128
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:43,225
Why?

129
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:44,971
'Cause it's fun.

130
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:47,537
I'll throw you a pop-up, okay?

131
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:49,455
You gotta go for this one.

132
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:51,095
Okay, you ready?

133
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:55,477
You got it.

134
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,690
Well, that's my bad.

135
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:00,049
I missed.

136
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:01,359
That's okay.

137
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:04,596
We'll try again later. It was my fault.
I threw it too hard.

138
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:06,431
Well, get the ball, will you, kiddo?

139
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:07,911
Good job!

140
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:09,684
He can play soccer.

141
00:08:09,784 --> 00:08:11,414
Yeah. Or chess, Eric.

142
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:13,406
I'm getting rid of this.

143
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:18,249
Have you seen the baseball?

144
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:10,203
Mom! Mom! Mom!

145
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:11,454
The tree made a noise!

146
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:12,539
- What?
- The tree growled!

147
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,376
Okay, look, Griff, Griff, Griff, Griff.
It's an old tree.

148
00:09:16,476 --> 00:09:17,961
Okay? Things creak when they get old.

149
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:19,045
Yeah, tell me about it.

150
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:20,765
Right? Like Daddy.

151
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,030
What can I do to make it better?

152
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:27,703
I don't know.

153
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:30,606
You wanna go inside
and check out your new room?

154
00:09:31,032 --> 00:09:32,141
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

155
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:34,519
- All right. Can we get rid of this?
- I don't know.

156
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:35,645
- Say yes.
- Yes.

157
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:38,375
Mommies creak when they get old too.

158
00:09:58,184 --> 00:10:00,336
What if the bad guys break in a window?

159
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:02,046
Then the alarm will still go off.

160
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:04,132
But what if the bad guys
cut the wires to the alarm?

161
00:10:04,232 --> 00:10:06,092
The wires are in the house.

162
00:10:06,192 --> 00:10:09,137
But what if the bad guys go to the
power plant and cut the wires there?

163
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:12,724
They'll be electrocuted
and then they'll be dead.

164
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:15,184
And if they're dead,
then they can't get in the house.

165
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:16,294
We armed yet?

166
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,980
Getting there.

167
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,275
Might wanna think about
getting a dog or something.

168
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,651
No!

169
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:27,155
Here, it says you have to input
the security code, and then the Stay key.

170
00:10:27,255 --> 00:10:28,531
Oh, yeah, smart guy?

171
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:29,782
What was that?

172
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:31,117
Same thing happened to me.

173
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:33,717
Isn't that weird? It's not even winter.

174
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:38,851
And they found this house,
and they ate it all up.

175
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:41,274
What are you doing?

176
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:43,655
Playing.

177
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:46,443
Do you wanna see a trick?

178
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:48,937
What kind of trick?

179
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:08,465
No way. How are you doing that?

180
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:15,548
You try.

181
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,280
You look ridiculous!

182
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:05,944
Shoot.

183
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:36,763
What is that?

184
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:06,439
I just lost an earring
behind the washing machine.

185
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:08,499
That's a bummer, honey.

186
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,498
I'll go look for it.

187
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:12,285
There's a leak back there.

188
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:16,256
Great. Welcome to owning a new home.

189
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I had to do something.
This place is, like,
a complete shithole.
There's not even any malls.
Like, the malls are boarded up.

190
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:26,386
Oh, my God,
that actually sounds really sad.

191
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:28,127
- So, your dad can't find...
- Dude.

192
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:31,339
This 1920s bungalow
was the site of a murder.

193
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:33,229
Oh, yeah, I love that show.

194
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:37,637
Oh, my God, that guy's a total freak.

195
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:39,237
I know.

196
00:13:40,573 --> 00:13:44,293
I'm Carrigan Burke,
and I'm here to clean house.

197
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:47,814
Oh, yeah. I love when he's, like...
Okay, ready?

198
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:49,399
"This house is clean."

199
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:50,499
"Is clean."

200
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,957
Hey, hey, hey. Can you turn that down?

201
00:13:53,503 --> 00:13:54,487
Come in?

202
00:13:54,587 --> 00:13:55,877
Kids are going to sleep.

203
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:57,907
Hi, Lauren.

204
00:13:58,007 --> 00:13:59,427
Hey, Mrs. Bowen.

205
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:02,089
Thank you. Good night.

206
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:05,347
"Mrs. Bowen"?

207
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:18,428
All right, lovebugs. It's time for bed.

208
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,346
Look at this mess.
Can you clean this up, Griff?

209
00:14:20,446 --> 00:14:21,848
The door's stuck.

210
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:22,932
Awesome!

211
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:26,686
- I think there are magnets in there.
- They're not magnets. They're my friends.

212
00:14:26,786 --> 00:14:28,076
Who are your friends?

213
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:30,398
The lost people.

214
00:14:30,498 --> 00:14:33,498
The lost people?
Who are the lost people?

215
00:14:35,211 --> 00:14:39,881
They live here. But they don't like it.
They wanna go to their home.

216
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,888
Sweetheart, we are home.

217
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:46,012
We're not lost.

218
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:48,875
This is our home
for a little while, okay?

219
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,543
Okay, Mommy.

220
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:51,643
You sure?

221
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:15,485
But why do I have to be up here?

222
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:19,155
Because this is the coolest room
in the house.

223
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:21,625
And you are the coolest kid
in the house.

224
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,118
But I don't like the ceiling.

225
00:15:24,218 --> 00:15:26,968
Now you're just being silly. Come on.

226
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:32,502
Who's my super boy?

227
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:33,753
Mom.

228
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:36,773
I'm sorry, are you too big
to say it now?

229
00:15:37,148 --> 00:15:38,148
No.

230
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:39,904
Then who's my super boy?

231
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:41,844
I am.

232
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:44,244
Yeah, you are.

233
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:46,031
I love you.

234
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:48,309
I love you, too.

235
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:51,039
All right, get some sleep, okay?

236
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:07,051
The night-light! Night-light!

237
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:11,124
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay, okay, okay?

238
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:12,224
Is that better?

239
00:16:13,768 --> 00:16:16,018
Griffin, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

240
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:17,806
Okay.

241
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Good night, buddy.
Good night.

242
00:16:34,914 --> 00:16:36,774
What was Griff freaking out about?

243
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:38,318
- The night-light.
- Yeah?

244
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:41,905
"The night-light, the night-light!"
I don't know what it is with him.

245
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:43,615
Yeah, well, we got too many kids.

246
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:47,055
I know. I said
we should have stopped at two.

247
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:48,933
Maddy's not the problem.

248
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:50,429
Not yet.

249
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:52,934
Here's to the little jerks.

250
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:57,795
Do you think we should
take him to a shrink?

251
00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:00,757
No. No. He's fine.

252
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:04,302
He's not fine.
It's because I lost him in that mall.

253
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:06,763
Baby. That was three years ago...

254
00:17:06,863 --> 00:17:08,973
and you were more freaked out
than he was.

255
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:11,184
Some kids are just nervous, you know?

256
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:14,354
- My brother was the same way.
- Yeah, now he lives alone in a trailer park.

257
00:17:14,454 --> 00:17:15,438
- He doesn't live alone.
- Yes, he does!

258
00:17:15,538 --> 00:17:17,357
No, he's got, like, 20 cockatoos.

259
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:20,037
You are not making me feel better!

260
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

261
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,320
Maybe you could coach.

262
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,280
What, high school?

263
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,658
Yeah. It'd be something.
I mean, you'd be happy.

264
00:18:50,758 --> 00:18:52,577
Yeah, I'd be hungry. We'd all be.

265
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:56,057
Can't support a family
coaching high school.

266
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:58,958
I should go back to work.

267
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:02,170
Again with that? Come on.
You don't wanna do that.

268
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,671
You're gonna leave me all alone
with these monsters?

269
00:19:03,771 --> 00:19:05,757
I need new underwear. Look at these.

270
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:07,091
These are sad.

271
00:19:07,191 --> 00:19:08,468
Your underwear is sad?

272
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:11,137
Yes, my underwear is sad.

273
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:14,367
Well, mine are very happy right now,
so get over here.

274
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:16,535
I'm serious.

275
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,910
You can't keep holding out
for something at your old salary.

276
00:19:20,496 --> 00:19:22,273
I think you're holding out.

277
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:24,150
- Why can't I just look for something?
- I'm not holding out.

278
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,194
Because we agreed I'd work
so you could write your book.

279
00:19:26,294 --> 00:19:28,054
That's what we agreed about.

280
00:19:28,755 --> 00:19:30,323
I'm not writing my book.

281
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:32,116
You will, when the kids
go back to school.

282
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:33,993
Don't put this on the kids.
This is all me.

283
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:36,829
Hey, I'm gonna find something, okay?

284
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:38,331
You gotta trust me.

285
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:40,101
We got that dinner party tomorrow night.

286
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:44,254
You love parties.
You can watch me drink bourbon.

287
00:19:44,354 --> 00:19:47,257
It's gonna be such a drag.
We don't even know those people.

288
00:19:47,357 --> 00:19:49,437
But Gary knows them.
He says the husband might be hiring.

289
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:50,969
Yeah.

290
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:54,109
Maybe our luck is about to change.
Aren't you feeling lucky?

291
00:19:54,864 --> 00:19:57,308
I think things are looking up.

292
00:19:57,408 --> 00:20:00,103
You're such a dork!

293
00:20:00,203 --> 00:20:02,963
I'm a dork? I'm a dork?

294
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,108
You and your sad underwear.

295
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,276
Take your pants off.

296
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:08,027
Yes, ma'am.

297
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:09,696
- Really?
- Yes, really.

298
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:10,947
- Wow.
- Play ball.

299
00:20:11,047 --> 00:20:12,127
All right.

300
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,723
- Dad!
- Yes!

301
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:17,745
Hey. What's up, buddy?

302
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:19,247
There's something upstairs.

303
00:20:19,347 --> 00:20:20,967
I think there's something in my room.

304
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:23,251
I'll be out there in a second.

305
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:24,711
So much for my luck.

306
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:25,753
- Don't move.
- Okay.

307
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:28,673
I'll be right back.
Think dirty thoughts.

308
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:31,573
What is it, buddy?
Where is it? In the attic?

309
00:20:33,152 --> 00:20:36,992
Houses make noises at night.
It's normal, I promise.

310
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:40,025
Not our old house.

311
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:42,293
Well, that's true.

312
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Tell me where you heard it.

313
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:54,198
Where did all of these clowns come from?

314
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:55,838
I found them in there.

315
00:20:57,051 --> 00:21:00,011
Why would somebody have a box of clowns?

316
00:21:01,014 --> 00:21:03,166
People collect weird things, pal.

317
00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:04,636
I don't like it up here.

318
00:21:05,393 --> 00:21:09,363
What's the matter? You scared?
What are you scared of?

319
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:11,398
Everything.

320
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:18,244
You're gonna get over that.
You gotta try to worry less, kiddo.

321
00:21:18,823 --> 00:21:19,823
You know?

322
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:23,415
If you're scared all the time,
Maddy's gonna get scared.

323
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:26,564
You gotta set a good example.

324
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:29,464
You're the big brother.
You gotta be brave, you know?

325
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:32,127
Holy shit!

326
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:35,839
What is it?

327
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:38,052
Talk to me.

328
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,430
Why do you linger here?

329
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:43,557
Use me. I can release you. Use me.

330
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:49,546
What's going on?

331
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:50,896
I don't know.

332
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:56,898
Eric, what is going on up there?

333
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,070
What, what, what?

334
00:22:09,749 --> 00:22:10,749
We have a squirrel.

335
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,194
You are such a nut ball!

336
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:15,029
- Big, fluffy tail!
- You scared us!

337
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:16,155
Terrifying!

338
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:18,085
Perfect. Rodents.

339
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:21,828
I'll set a trap tomorrow.

340
00:22:21,928 --> 00:22:26,165
After you catch it with the trap,
will you release it to the woods?

341
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:29,435
Yeah, sure. Would that make you
feel better, honey?

342
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:31,939
I'm not sleeping up there
until it's gone.

343
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:56,022
Where are you?

344
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:03,403
Are you nice?

345
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:09,241
How did you get there?

346
00:24:12,955 --> 00:24:14,495
Did you cry?

347
00:24:22,298 --> 00:24:24,218
Help you how?

348
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:35,056
But I can't see you.

349
00:24:39,607 --> 00:24:42,227
Who else is there with you?

350
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:50,743
Can Griffin come, too?

351
00:24:55,498 --> 00:24:58,828
Yes, I can be brave.

352
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:06,005
I have to ask my mommy.

353
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:22,152
No.

354
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:25,738
I'm not afraid.

355
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,950
Yes.

356
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,740
But, how will you get here?

357
00:25:41,794 --> 00:25:43,594
Maddy, what's going on?

358
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:47,837
They're coming.

359
00:25:48,176 --> 00:25:49,176
Who is?

360
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:50,969
Who is coming?

361
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,716
Maddy!

362
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:05,566
Get away from the TV!

363
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:18,708
What's going on?

364
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,510
They're here.

365
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

366
00:26:48,027 --> 00:26:50,763
It says here it's probably just a
loose conductor in the electrical panel.

367
00:26:50,863 --> 00:26:52,390
I'm calling an electrician.

368
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,392
Are you gonna pay him
for what I can do myself?

369
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:56,603
Those guys charge an arm and a leg.
Griff will help. Right, buddy?

370
00:26:56,703 --> 00:26:59,272
- Griff will help you fix an electrical panel?
- Yeah.

371
00:26:59,372 --> 00:27:02,108
I found out where the squirrel
got in, by the way.

372
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:04,310
There's a hole by the roof line.
I'm gonna block it up.

373
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,446
Daddy, I don't want cereal.
I want pizza.

374
00:27:06,546 --> 00:27:08,948
- Yeah, for breakfast?
- For all the time!

375
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:10,116
Three times a day?

376
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:12,285
Griffin! I told you not to
touch my phone!

377
00:27:12,385 --> 00:27:13,578
I didn't touch your phone.

378
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:15,622
- Then why is it fried?
- How should I know?

379
00:27:15,722 --> 00:27:17,207
Here we go.

380
00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:19,375
- I need a new phone.
- You do?

381
00:27:19,475 --> 00:27:20,627
No more phones, honey.

382
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:23,421
This isn't a luxury item, Dad.
It's a necessity.

383
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:25,423
What if you need to reach me
in an emergency?

384
00:27:25,523 --> 00:27:26,633
We can't afford it, honey.

385
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:27,800
That's bullshit.

386
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,636
What are you being so selfish about?

387
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:31,095
That's bullshit!

388
00:27:31,195 --> 00:27:33,473
If you want a new phone,
you could get a part-time job.

389
00:27:33,573 --> 00:27:35,225
I'll get a job when you get a job.

390
00:27:35,325 --> 00:27:36,476
Hey, she has a job!

391
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,560
Excuse me?

392
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,080
You kids are her job!

393
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:42,249
Yeah. Which I apparently suck at.

394
00:27:42,582 --> 00:27:44,002
I don't think you suck at it.

395
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,880
Thank you, sweetheart.

396
00:27:49,088 --> 00:27:50,258
Hey, Maddy.

397
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:53,493
Do you remember last night?

398
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:55,553
When you said, "They're here"?

399
00:27:58,348 --> 00:28:00,333
What did you mean?

400
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:01,501
Who's here?

401
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:03,628
Just my friends.

402
00:28:03,728 --> 00:28:05,171
Yeah?

403
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:07,257
Your pretend friends?

404
00:28:07,357 --> 00:28:11,277
No, they're lost people.
They're not pretend, Mommy.

405
00:28:17,116 --> 00:28:19,644
That girl's gonna put me in a hole, man.

406
00:28:19,744 --> 00:28:21,254
She's grounded.

407
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:24,857
Judge Bowen has spoken.
For at least 24 hours.

408
00:28:24,957 --> 00:28:27,037
Remind her she's babysitting
tonight, will you?

409
00:28:27,293 --> 00:28:28,945
I hate when Kendra babysits.

410
00:28:29,045 --> 00:28:30,530
So does she, pal.

411
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,032
I think I might get some squirrel traps.

412
00:28:33,132 --> 00:28:34,784
Yeah, that's a good idea.

413
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:36,894
What is this?

414
00:28:37,553 --> 00:28:38,663
- Griffin, put that down.
- What is that?

415
00:28:38,763 --> 00:28:40,707
- Put that down.
- Is that a bone or something?

416
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:42,584
- Yeah, just put that down.
- Let me see.

417
00:28:42,684 --> 00:28:45,274
I guess this is a buried pet or something.
Maybe it's a horse.

418
00:28:46,312 --> 00:28:47,547
Maybe it's a pig, too! A pig!

419
00:28:47,647 --> 00:28:48,767
Is this freaking you out?

420
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,400
- Stop! Stop!
- What's the matter?

421
00:28:52,068 --> 00:28:53,068
All right, put that back.

422
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,642
- That's not going through.
- I'm sorry about that.

423
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:03,012
My wife said she might cancel one of the
cards because we don't need them all.

424
00:29:03,112 --> 00:29:05,660
- I didn't know she did it.
- It's not canceled, it's over the limit.

425
00:29:06,582 --> 00:29:08,332
- Is that what it says there?
- Yep.

426
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:11,629
Okay, let's try this one.

427
00:29:13,756 --> 00:29:16,242
Nice apron. Are you in the union?

428
00:29:16,342 --> 00:29:18,642
You have a good pension here, for this?

429
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:21,998
- Sorry.
- Yeah?

430
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:24,428
This one's "canceled" too.

431
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:29,005
Strike two, huh? All right.

432
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:30,590
Hey, third one's the charm.

433
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,980
Fingers crossed.

434
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:40,828
How are we doing? Are we good?

435
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,727
- I like that sound.
- Yeah, you're good.

436
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:44,247
Okay.

437
00:30:04,807 --> 00:30:08,836
Damn it! Griffin! I asked you to bring
these comic books upstairs.

438
00:30:08,936 --> 00:30:12,632
- I was just about to do it.
- Yeah, I almost broke my neck.

439
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:16,010
Because you were walking and playing
that game at the same time, I bet.

440
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,740
Thank you.

441
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:41,263
Maddy?

442
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:43,433
Is that you?

443
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,060
Maddy?

444
00:31:02,615 --> 00:31:03,775
Maddy.

445
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:06,294
This isn't funny.

446
00:32:12,435 --> 00:32:14,712
All right, everybody, come downstairs!

447
00:32:14,812 --> 00:32:16,297
- Family meeting.
- Dad! Dad!

448
00:32:16,397 --> 00:32:18,550
- Let's go! Kendra!
- Dad! I have to tell you something!

449
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:22,323
- What's going on with the flowers out there?
- I don't know. Did you get pizza?

450
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:24,931
- I just made chicken nuggets.
- That's okay. We'll have both.

451
00:32:25,031 --> 00:32:26,266
- Pizza!
- My baby wanted pizza.

452
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:28,434
You put them together,
you got chicken nugget pizza.

453
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:30,270
Dad, the weirdest thing happened!

454
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:33,439
- Why are you screaming at me, Griffin?
- Griffin, you got to tone it down.

455
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:36,209
- What?
- "What?" Here's what.

456
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:38,444
- What's that?
- What do you think of that?

457
00:32:38,544 --> 00:32:39,779
- No way!
- Yeah, way!

458
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:41,155
- You know what else?
- Now get off my back.

459
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:42,448
- Thank you, Dad.
- You got it.

460
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:44,158
- Dad! And guess what?
- Yeah.

461
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:45,952
- The ball rolled across the floor...
- What? What?

462
00:32:46,052 --> 00:32:47,704
- knocked into the closet...
- Hey, look at this!

463
00:32:47,804 --> 00:32:49,747
I got you that AR drone you wanted.

464
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:51,833
- Look at that. Isn't that cool?
- Dad, you aren't listening to me!

465
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:53,367
- It's got a camera on it.
- It does?

466
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:56,004
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, cutie?

467
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:58,047
Look at that.
These are the ones you liked.

468
00:32:58,147 --> 00:32:59,340
You can wear them to the party tonight.

469
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Dad, that's not all!
Then this tower of comic books formed!
When I turned around
they blew back at my face!
- Wow.
- They had just appeared out of nowhere...
Really? That's crazy!
- It's not funny, Dad!
- Yeah, it's hilarious.

470
00:33:09,784 --> 00:33:11,124
How did you pay for this?

471
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:14,147
How do you think? I stole it.
Robbed a bank.

472
00:33:14,247 --> 00:33:15,315
Uh-oh.

473
00:33:15,415 --> 00:33:17,275
Uh-oh, Daddy-O!

474
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,736
We gotta bring this stuff back.
You have to take it back.

475
00:33:19,836 --> 00:33:20,945
- Mom, no.
- Yes.

476
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:22,405
- I'm not bringing anything back.
- Dad!

477
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:23,990
- Griffin.
- I think we deserve a treat.

478
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,826
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

479
00:33:26,926 --> 00:33:29,596
Griffin! Gosh!
It's been all afternoon with this.

480
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:32,457
Just so you know,
I'm putting the passcode on my phone...

481
00:33:32,557 --> 00:33:34,417
- so you can't get to it.
- Please don't antagonize him.

482
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:36,794
- Dad, we have to move.
- We're not moving!

483
00:33:36,894 --> 00:33:37,962
- Now, quit it!
- Amy...

484
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:39,088
No, I expect this from Maddy...

485
00:33:39,188 --> 00:33:40,938
but I'm starting to think
that he's the baby in the family.

486
00:33:44,861 --> 00:33:46,179
- Here you go, Mommy.
- Perfect.

487
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,472
Thank you, sweetheart.

488
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:48,848
Griffin, I'm sorry.

489
00:33:48,948 --> 00:33:50,698
That didn't go as I hoped.

490
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:52,369
How's the pizza?

491
00:33:53,077 --> 00:33:54,938
- Not good.
- No?

492
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:56,288
No.

493
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:00,318
You got to try it with the nuggets.

494
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:01,748
It's a little better.

495
00:34:08,343 --> 00:34:12,973
I am an awful person.
I called my own son a baby.

496
00:34:13,473 --> 00:34:17,693
Well, if it's any consolation,
my mom called me a lot worse.

497
00:34:19,312 --> 00:34:21,652
There's something wrong with him, Eric.

498
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:24,282
It's not just the anxiety.

499
00:34:24,817 --> 00:34:26,553
- He's fine.
- He's not fine.

500
00:34:26,653 --> 00:34:29,453
He is saying the craziest things
and he believes them.

501
00:34:31,991 --> 00:34:35,103
All right, what do you want me to do?
You want me to... I'll take him to someone.

502
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:38,231
How? I mean, you keep spending money
that we don't have.

503
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:39,274
Why are you doing that?

504
00:34:39,374 --> 00:34:42,004
I mean, what do I got,
the illusion of...

505
00:34:43,086 --> 00:34:44,153
Spending money?

506
00:34:44,253 --> 00:34:45,655
I'm trying to...
I'm doing the best I can.

507
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:48,385
I wanna give you guys what you want.
I'm trying to...

508
00:34:49,258 --> 00:34:51,077
I know. I know. I know.

509
00:34:51,177 --> 00:34:53,927
Look, look, look, look,
it was a bad day, okay?

510
00:34:54,597 --> 00:34:55,807
It'll get better.

511
00:34:58,518 --> 00:35:00,638
- I'm gonna go get ready.
- Okay.

512
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- It's the windmill!
- Daddy! Break my arm!
- Okay. Okay.
- Break my arm! Break my neck!

513
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Dad?
- Neck! Neck!
Dad, what if the squirrel gets in?
I sealed up the hole.
It's tighter than Fort Knox up there.

514
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:25,111
Bye-bye, Daddy.

515
00:35:25,211 --> 00:35:27,614
- Then why did you leave the trap?
- Insurance. You can't be too safe.

516
00:35:27,714 --> 00:35:29,407
Squirrels are wily.

517
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:31,451
- Don't worry about it.
- Bye-bye.

518
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:33,244
- Set the alarm, call us if you need us.
- I will.

519
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:34,954
- Call you on my new phone.
- Yeah, you will.

520
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:36,706
- Be good for your sister.
- Bye, Mommy.

521
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:38,958
- Lock the door!
- Bye. We will. Bye.

522
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:41,628
- I wanna stay up all night!
- No. Madison...

523
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Stay up all night!
- No, go upstairs.
No!
All right. All snug?
Wait.
Piggy-corn said she wants more kisses.

524
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
She does?
How many?

525
00:35:55,241 --> 00:35:56,476
She says three.

526
00:35:56,576 --> 00:35:57,602
- Three?
- Three.

527
00:35:57,702 --> 00:35:59,452
Sure? Okay.

528
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:02,982
One, two, three...

529
00:36:03,082 --> 00:36:04,882
20. 900.

530
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:07,005
I can't fall asleep.

531
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,090
Why not?

532
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:12,416
I think there's a storm coming.

533
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:18,331
Gary tells me you played
ball together in college.

534
00:36:18,431 --> 00:36:19,707
He said you had quite the swing.

535
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:21,793
Triple-A, but I still do swing
with the best of them.

536
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:23,563
Don't get any ideas, Barbara.

537
00:36:24,812 --> 00:36:27,257
He could have played in the majors.
He's being very modest.

538
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
No, I... Bad shoulder,
so it wasn't meant to be.
What are you gonna do?
Lucky you had a plan B to fall back on.
There's nothing wrong
with a suit and tie.

539
00:36:35,615 --> 00:36:37,995
I keep telling my son, it pays the rent.

540
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:39,894
It's a good thing I have a suit
and a tie then.

541
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:43,231
I can put it on Monday morning if you
like. What time do I start? Nine?

542
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:44,581
They just moved to Willow Point.

543
00:36:44,832 --> 00:36:47,694
My brother had a house
in that development back in the 90s.

544
00:36:47,794 --> 00:36:50,113
We'd never visit him
because of the cemetery thing.

545
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:52,240
The thought of it
just gave me the willies.

546
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,533
What "cemetery thing"?

547
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:56,578
Just that that development
was built on a former cemetery.

548
00:36:56,678 --> 00:36:58,454
- Yeah, but they moved it though.
- Yeah.

549
00:36:58,554 --> 00:37:00,957
The developers relocated the whole thing
to Broxton Park.

550
00:37:01,057 --> 00:37:03,637
200 acres. This was years ago.

551
00:37:04,727 --> 00:37:06,847
You're kidding me!
They moved the whole cemetery?

552
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,715
The realtor didn't mention it?

553
00:37:08,815 --> 00:37:11,551
No. Actually, they didn't mention it.

554
00:37:11,651 --> 00:37:15,930
Isn't it like, you know, very uncool
to move all those bodies and...

555
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,516
Well, it's not like it was
an ancient tribal burial ground.

556
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:19,559
Yeah, I know.

557
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:22,979
It's just 10 minutes away.
People can still visit loved ones.

558
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:25,039
But now it's in a nicer neighborhood.

559
00:37:25,498 --> 00:37:26,668
I'm sorry.

560

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

561
00:39:29,205 --> 00:39:30,773
There's nothing to be afraid of.

562
00:39:30,873 --> 00:39:32,775
There's nothing to be afraid of.

563
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:35,028
There's nothing to be afraid of.

564
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:36,958
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:39,068

567
00:41:39,168 --> 00:41:40,958
Please, help!

568
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:15,805
Kendra!

569
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,480
Maddy.

570
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:33,123
We're gonna get in big trouble.

571
00:43:38,204 --> 00:43:39,214
Griffin?

572
00:43:41,457 --> 00:43:42,497
Griffin!

573
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:44,485
I'm scared!

574
00:43:44,585 --> 00:43:46,321
Just stay away from the closet.

575
00:43:46,421 --> 00:43:48,381
Don't leave me!

576
00:43:51,884 --> 00:43:53,184
Kendra!

577
00:43:54,554 --> 00:43:55,554
Kendra!

578
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:12,472
Griffin! Please open the door!

579
00:44:12,572 --> 00:44:15,225
Please help! Please help me! Please!

580
00:44:15,325 --> 00:44:16,745
Open the door!

What the hell is that?

583
00:46:59,072 --> 00:47:00,412
Honey, stop...

584
00:47:01,074 --> 00:47:02,664
Stop the car.

585
00:47:03,201 --> 00:47:04,411
Stop the car.

586
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:12,777
Somebody!

587
00:47:12,877 --> 00:47:15,238
- Griff!
- Dad! Help!

588
00:47:15,338 --> 00:47:16,338
Griffin!

589
00:47:16,756 --> 00:47:19,376
Oh, my God! Baby, are you all right?

590
00:47:19,842 --> 00:47:21,494
- Mom, Mom!
- Okay, baby.

591
00:47:21,594 --> 00:47:23,288
What the hell is going on?

592
00:47:23,388 --> 00:47:24,388
Mom!

593
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:26,498
- Dad, Mom...
- What's going...

594
00:47:26,598 --> 00:47:29,669
There were voices, I got locked in the
basement and the tree grabbed Griffin...

595
00:47:29,769 --> 00:47:33,114
- Slow down. I cannot... What did you say?
- I can't find Maddy!

596
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

597
00:47:44,701 --> 00:47:45,911
Madison!

598
00:47:47,286 --> 00:47:48,786
Maddy, honey...

599
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:54,791
Madison!

600
00:48:01,968 --> 00:48:03,138
Maddy?

601
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:14,311
Mommy...

602
00:48:21,654 --> 00:48:23,744
- Madison?
- Mommy...

603
00:48:26,993 --> 00:48:28,243
Mommy.

604
00:48:32,665 --> 00:48:33,665
Mom?

605
00:48:34,584 --> 00:48:35,924
Mom?

606
00:48:36,836 --> 00:48:37,836
Mom!

607
00:48:38,254 --> 00:48:39,239
Mom!

608
00:48:39,339 --> 00:48:41,299
Griff. What...

609
00:48:43,551 --> 00:48:45,681
Mommy? Mommy?

610
00:48:51,017 --> 00:48:52,637
Maddy, where are you?

611
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:02,358
Mommy. Mommy.

612
00:49:07,283 --> 00:49:09,663
Daddy, is that you?

613
00:49:17,502 --> 00:49:19,779
- I don't even know what happened.
- I know, but we have to tell them.

614
00:49:19,879 --> 00:49:21,698
We gotta figure out what happened.

615
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:23,449
We can't call the cops.

616
00:49:23,549 --> 00:49:25,618
What are you gonna tell them?
That our daughter got...

617
00:49:25,718 --> 00:49:27,537
- I don't know what just happened.
- I'm gonna tell them...

618
00:49:27,637 --> 00:49:29,956
We need to figure out
what's going on. Okay?

619
00:49:30,056 --> 00:49:31,958
Listen to me. Listen to me.

620
00:49:32,058 --> 00:49:34,802
- If you call the cops they're gonna blame us.
- No, they're not gonna blame us.

621
00:49:34,902 --> 00:49:37,630
We're just gonna tell them what happened.
We're just gonna tell them the truth.

622
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:40,633
I'm gonna tell them the truth.
I'm gonna tell them the truth.

623
00:49:40,733 --> 00:49:41,968
We're gonna tell them the truth
together.

624
00:49:42,068 --> 00:49:45,096
I'm gonna tell them the truth.
What happened, I'm gonna tell them.

625
00:49:45,196 --> 00:49:47,682
But we don't know
what the truth is, honey.

626
00:49:47,782 --> 00:49:49,412
Eric, we have to call somebody.

627
00:49:52,078 --> 00:49:54,958
There's gotta be somebody
who's gonna believe us.

628
00:50:00,294 --> 00:50:02,322
Griffin was the first one
to notice things.

629
00:50:02,422 --> 00:50:06,432
Noises... and just things.

630
00:50:09,262 --> 00:50:10,932
We thought he was making it up.

631
00:50:11,723 --> 00:50:13,103
I'm sorry, buddy.

632
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,002
We didn't know where else to go.

633
00:50:16,102 --> 00:50:17,962
No, you did the right thing coming here.

634
00:50:18,062 --> 00:50:22,193
When I was a student here
this office had the craziest reputation.

635
00:50:22,442 --> 00:50:23,572
I think we still do.

636
00:50:25,194 --> 00:50:26,512
May I ask where your husband is?

637
00:50:26,612 --> 00:50:28,765
He's at home with Kendra, our oldest.

638
00:50:28,865 --> 00:50:30,835
We don't wanna leave Maddy alone.

639
00:50:31,326 --> 00:50:34,896
The last time you had contact with her
was after she disappeared?

640
00:50:34,996 --> 00:50:38,566
Just the one time,
through the television set.

641
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:41,069
I'm sorry...
I hear how crazy this sounds.

642
00:50:41,169 --> 00:50:42,695
I know I must sound ridiculous.

643
00:50:42,795 --> 00:50:45,615
No, it doesn't.
It doesn't sound crazy at all.

644
00:50:45,715 --> 00:50:47,367
- It's my fault.
- No, it is not.

645
00:50:47,467 --> 00:50:50,870
Look at me. It is not your fault.

646
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:53,560
Why do you think it's your fault?

647
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,310
I left her alone.

648
00:50:55,892 --> 00:50:57,982
I knew I shouldn't have.

649
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:00,380
But I was scared.

650
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,980
Of course you were scared.

651
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:06,886
You have to get my sister back.

652
00:51:06,986 --> 00:51:08,526
You have to.

653
00:51:09,989 --> 00:51:11,619
Can you do that?

654
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:15,161
I can try.

655
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
That's the TV...

656
00:51:34,263 --> 00:51:39,002
where Maddy's hands
were pressed against.

657
00:51:39,102 --> 00:51:44,340
This is the staircase that Griffin
was first grabbed by the tree.

658
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,342
It's probably something to do
with Maddy.

659
00:51:46,442 --> 00:51:48,469
And then there's that.
That's a little shocker.

660
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:49,971
You guys want some sandwiches
or something?

661
00:51:50,071 --> 00:51:51,639
- It won't be necessary.
- I'm gonna start recording.

662
00:51:51,739 --> 00:51:55,123
- Is that cool?
- Yeah. Knock yourself out.

663
00:51:58,287 --> 00:51:59,355
That's solid wall.

664
00:51:59,455 --> 00:52:03,205
I've poked and prodded
about a hundred times, so...

665
00:52:03,918 --> 00:52:06,946
But you think she got pulled
through there somehow?

666
00:52:07,046 --> 00:52:08,376
We don't know.

667
00:52:09,215 --> 00:52:11,715
What do you think,
it's like a magic portal?

668
00:52:12,468 --> 00:52:13,638
I just said we don't know.

669
00:52:13,886 --> 00:52:15,288
Do you mind if I hold onto that?

670
00:52:15,388 --> 00:52:16,956
Till she gets back.

671
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I don't want it, you know,
lost in the shuffle.
No problem.

672
00:52:26,232 --> 00:52:29,636
I shot a pretty amazing
occurrence recently.

673
00:52:29,736 --> 00:52:33,156
We were at this old house in Naperville,
and a piano bench...

674
00:52:33,573 --> 00:52:36,033
rolled 10 feet across the parlor floor.

675
00:52:36,743 --> 00:52:38,163
It took seven hours.

676
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,980
- To roll 10 feet?
- Yeah.

677
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,817
I used a special time-lapse setting
on my camera.

678
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:47,627
So, nailed the whole thing.

679
00:52:48,087 --> 00:52:50,837
You can't catch that kind of a thing
with the naked eye, so I...

680
00:53:00,975 --> 00:53:04,475
Did you get all that
on your time-lapse camera?

681
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:08,174
From my experience...

682
00:53:08,274 --> 00:53:11,114
this doesn't seem to be
a classic haunting.

683
00:53:11,694 --> 00:53:14,013
What you have here...

684
00:53:14,113 --> 00:53:17,850
is probably closer to
a poltergeist intrusion.

685
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:19,686
What's the difference?

686
00:53:19,786 --> 00:53:22,230
Ghosts usually appear
as harmless apparitions.

687
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,170
Whereas poltergeists...

688
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:27,360
They're noisy, they lash out...

689
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,946
they're violent, they move objects.

690
00:53:30,046 --> 00:53:34,626
It comes, and then it can
just as suddenly go away.

691
00:53:35,468 --> 00:53:37,338
And take Maddy with it?

692
00:54:30,273 --> 00:54:31,943
- You okay?
- Yeah.

693
00:54:33,109 --> 00:54:34,529
What's going on?

694
00:54:36,696 --> 00:54:40,196
I should've been... home.

695
00:54:40,867 --> 00:54:42,769
- I should've been home.
- Don't do this, okay?

696
00:54:42,869 --> 00:54:44,749
I can't lose you now.

697
00:54:45,455 --> 00:54:48,191
If I say it's not gonna be okay...

698
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:50,711
you have to say,
"Of course it is, sweetheart."

699
00:54:52,879 --> 00:54:55,259
Otherwise, we're not
gonna get through this.

700
00:55:08,895 --> 00:55:12,674
We've done a scan of the house,
and now we're wiring into your system.

701
00:55:12,774 --> 00:55:14,717
So if Maddy tries
to make contact again...

702
00:55:14,817 --> 00:55:16,719
we'll have a better sense
of what's going on...

703
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:18,680
which may help us get her back.

704
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,973
Does that sound okay?

705
00:55:20,073 --> 00:55:22,413
That sounds great.
Can we do it a little faster?

706
00:55:23,785 --> 00:55:24,955
Watch out.

707
00:55:27,747 --> 00:55:29,577
Let me ask you something.

708
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:31,828
Your dad...

709
00:55:32,835 --> 00:55:34,795
he's been out of work a while, right?

710
00:55:35,755 --> 00:55:37,595
Yeah, I guess.

711
00:55:39,133 --> 00:55:41,973
That's okay. Nobody's perfect.

712
00:55:43,638 --> 00:55:45,428
I was just thinking about it.

713
00:55:45,765 --> 00:55:48,710
If he really wanted
to make some money quick...

714
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:51,440
a poltergeist abduction
isn't a bad idea.

715
00:55:52,313 --> 00:55:54,591
Even if it turned out to be a fake.

716
00:55:54,691 --> 00:55:57,719
You go public with it,
you do some TV appearances.

717
00:55:57,819 --> 00:56:00,096
- You get your own reality show.
- Would you stop?

718
00:56:00,196 --> 00:56:01,606
How cool would that be?

719
00:56:02,156 --> 00:56:04,601
We don't want a reality show.

720
00:56:04,701 --> 00:56:06,241
We just want Maddy back.

721
00:56:10,206 --> 00:56:11,786
You're good, kid.

722
00:56:12,959 --> 00:56:14,539
Very good.

723
00:56:15,795 --> 00:56:19,032
Did you set up the heat sensor
in the back of the closet yet?

724
00:56:19,132 --> 00:56:20,366
No, not yet.

725
00:56:20,466 --> 00:56:22,506
I didn't know how to fasten that thing.

726
00:56:24,137 --> 00:56:25,677
Screw it, Boyd.

727
00:56:27,307 --> 00:56:28,517
Okay...

728
00:56:29,517 --> 00:56:30,637
Captain.

729
00:56:41,487 --> 00:56:42,987
"Screw it."

730
00:57:50,723 --> 00:57:52,603
Gotta be kidding me.

731
00:58:23,423 --> 00:58:24,803
God damn it.

732
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

733
00:59:04,172 --> 00:59:05,302
Gotcha.

734
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:40,666
No!

735
01:00:11,864 --> 01:00:13,534
You all done up there?

736
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:15,518
Yeah.

737
01:00:15,618 --> 01:00:17,698
The heat sensor is in the closet?

738
01:00:20,832 --> 01:00:21,832
Sort of.

739
01:00:23,084 --> 01:00:25,754
Boyd, I really need you to
take this more seriously, okay?

740
01:00:26,212 --> 01:00:27,196
Okay?

741
01:00:27,296 --> 01:00:29,046
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

742
01:00:31,384 --> 01:00:33,244
I think what I was saying is...

743
01:00:33,344 --> 01:00:35,955
some people believe
there are different levels of reality.

744
01:00:36,055 --> 01:00:37,305
We're on a physical plane...

745
01:00:37,598 --> 01:00:40,960
but when we die
our spirits go to another level.

746
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:44,589
An astral plane or a spiritual plane.

747
01:00:44,689 --> 01:00:48,979
Which is sort of here
and not here at the same time.

748
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:52,240
Okay...

749
01:00:53,698 --> 01:00:55,118
Look at this.

750
01:00:58,995 --> 01:01:01,875
Okay. Now this...

751
01:01:02,415 --> 01:01:03,816
Thank you, Dr. Powell.

752
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:06,626
This is us here. In the physical level.

753
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,420
And somehow Maddy got pulled here.

754
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:16,551
Here and not here at the same time.

755
01:01:17,013 --> 01:01:18,513
Exactly.

756
01:01:20,725 --> 01:01:24,655
Then someone should go in there
and show her the way back here.

757
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:28,402
That's actually not a bad idea.

758
01:01:32,195 --> 01:01:34,138
I'm fairly certain...

759
01:01:34,238 --> 01:01:37,684
Maddy is able to hear us
a lot better than we can hear her.

760
01:01:37,784 --> 01:01:42,855
So this equipment is going to
filter out all the interference...

761
01:01:42,955 --> 01:01:46,526
so that we'll be better able
to communicate with her.

762
01:01:46,626 --> 01:01:47,956
How do we start?

763
01:01:50,755 --> 01:01:52,595
You just call out to her.

764
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,340
Okay.

765
01:02:01,265 --> 01:02:02,635
Maddy?

766
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:08,610
Madison, it's Mommy.

767
01:02:10,483 --> 01:02:11,783
Can you hear me?

768
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:14,858
Madison, we wanna talk to you.

769
01:02:15,655 --> 01:02:18,625
We just want you
to let us know that you're safe.

770
01:02:22,829 --> 01:02:24,329
Are you with us?

771
01:02:25,748 --> 01:02:29,208
Maddy, we need to hear your voice,
okay, sweetheart?

772
01:02:29,627 --> 01:02:31,797
Can you say hello to Mommy?

773
01:02:39,595 --> 01:02:40,755
Are you with us?

774
01:02:41,973 --> 01:02:44,023
We all miss you so much.

775
01:02:51,649 --> 01:02:55,649
Mommy misses you
so, so, so, so, so, so much.

776
01:02:58,948 --> 01:03:00,658
Hi, Mommy.

777
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,769
Hi, baby!

778
01:03:02,869 --> 01:03:04,312
Hey, honey. Daddy's here, too.

779
01:03:04,412 --> 01:03:06,648
We're all waiting for you, honey.

780
01:03:06,748 --> 01:03:08,858
Daddy, where are you?

781
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:12,111
We're home. We need you
to come back to us now, honey.

782
01:03:12,211 --> 01:03:16,449
I tried, but I can't find you.

783
01:03:16,549 --> 01:03:18,952
Okay, okay, okay. Keep on trying, okay?

784
01:03:19,052 --> 01:03:22,052
Because we are right here.
You're so close!

785
01:03:23,097 --> 01:03:26,793
Mommy? Mommy?

786
01:03:26,893 --> 01:03:28,962
Daddy, is that you?

787
01:03:29,062 --> 01:03:30,338
No, Daddy's right here, honey.

788
01:03:30,438 --> 01:03:32,924
There's somebody with her!
Who's with you, baby?

789
01:03:33,024 --> 01:03:34,551
- Daddy's right here.
- Who is with you?

790
01:03:34,651 --> 01:03:37,241
They're all around me.

791
01:03:43,201 --> 01:03:46,201
Maddy! Maddy? Maddy?

792
01:03:51,459 --> 01:03:53,209
- Maddy, can you hear us?
- What's going on?

793
01:03:55,254 --> 01:03:57,594
Mommy. Mommy.

794
01:03:58,049 --> 01:03:59,089
Daddy?

795
01:04:00,093 --> 01:04:01,263
Maddy!

796
01:04:01,594 --> 01:04:02,644
Madison?

797
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:07,350
Daddy, I'm scared.

798
01:04:12,355 --> 01:04:13,339
Maddy!

799
01:04:13,439 --> 01:04:14,382
No, wait!

800
01:04:14,482 --> 01:04:15,482
Mr. Bowen, no!

801
01:04:54,772 --> 01:04:55,942
Maddy.

802
01:05:11,914 --> 01:05:14,004
Maddy, it's me, honey.

803
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:33,190
Give her back! Give her back!

804
01:05:34,896 --> 01:05:36,476
Give her back! You can't have her!

805
01:05:38,691 --> 01:05:40,361
Get out!

806
01:06:08,388 --> 01:06:10,498
You okay? Did you get hit?

807
01:06:10,598 --> 01:06:11,749
No? You okay?

808
01:06:11,849 --> 01:06:12,792
Everything okay?

809
01:06:12,892 --> 01:06:13,960
What is that?

810
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,962
You're okay. Eric!

811
01:06:16,062 --> 01:06:17,088
Eric.

812
01:06:17,188 --> 01:06:18,228
What happened?

813
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,345
That, Mr. Bowen...

814
01:06:24,445 --> 01:06:26,065
that's Maddy's way out.

815
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,769
But I think we're gonna need some help
in getting her there.

816
01:06:31,869 --> 01:06:32,869
What kind of help?

817
01:06:34,038 --> 01:06:36,708
Have you ever heard of Carrigan Burke?

818
01:06:37,959 --> 01:06:41,379
No effing way.

819
01:07:31,471 --> 01:07:33,181
What happened to your hand?

820
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:37,519
Blanchard, Michigan. '97.

821
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:42,150
Haunted root cellar.
Spirit didn't wanna leave.

822
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:45,900
Luckily, they're not all that angry.

823
01:07:46,486 --> 01:07:47,486
Ours is.

824
01:07:49,614 --> 01:07:51,057
- Buddy, you okay?
- Yeah.

825
01:07:51,157 --> 01:07:52,141
Guy's here.

826
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:53,726
You must be the Bowens.

827
01:07:53,826 --> 01:07:55,486
And you must be the cavalry.

828
01:07:59,832 --> 01:08:01,172
Dr. Powell.

829
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:05,050
We're all set up
if you wanna get started.

830
01:08:11,678 --> 01:08:12,912
Hey.

831
01:08:13,012 --> 01:08:15,790
Big fan. My name's Boyd.
Nice to meet you.

832
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:16,890
Here.

833
01:08:22,021 --> 01:08:23,521
He knows this can't be on TV, right?

834
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:26,030
No, I told him that.

835
01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:29,053
So why is he doing it?

836
01:08:29,153 --> 01:08:31,163
This was the area of bilocation?

837
01:08:31,781 --> 01:08:33,516
A table fell out of there.

838
01:08:33,616 --> 01:08:35,366
I was almost crushed.

839
01:08:37,912 --> 01:08:39,772
Is everything all right?

840
01:08:39,872 --> 01:08:42,042
If it was, I wouldn't be here.

841
01:08:49,966 --> 01:08:53,386
This house is not clean.

842
01:08:54,304 --> 01:08:55,304
What?

843
01:09:40,099 --> 01:09:43,545
All right, first things first.

844
01:09:43,645 --> 01:09:45,655
I want you to tell me
a little bit about Maddy.

845
01:09:46,356 --> 01:09:50,009
Did you ever feel that
she was a little bit off?

846
01:09:50,109 --> 01:09:51,261
- Off?
- Yeah.

847
01:09:51,361 --> 01:09:53,388
- What do you mean?
- How do you mean, "Off"?

848
01:09:53,488 --> 01:09:57,016
Did you ever hear her
talking to things that weren't there?

849
01:09:57,116 --> 01:10:00,446
Yeah, she has imaginary friends,
but that's normal.

850
01:10:01,287 --> 01:10:05,400
I think what he's trying to say is that
Maddy might have been born with a gift.

851
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,130
That's not the word I'd use,
but all right.

852
01:10:08,628 --> 01:10:12,008
You mean she can talk to ghosts?

853
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:14,075
She's six years old.

854
01:10:14,175 --> 01:10:17,078
Which means that her life force
is at its purest...

855
01:10:17,178 --> 01:10:20,468
without judgment or cynicism.

856
01:10:21,432 --> 01:10:23,626
Why do you think they reached out
to her in the first place?

857
01:10:23,726 --> 01:10:25,545
They didn't reach out to any of you.

858
01:10:25,645 --> 01:10:28,275
You keep saying "they." Who are "they"?

859
01:10:30,108 --> 01:10:34,358
Brooke tells me that this development
was built on a cemetery.

860
01:10:36,447 --> 01:10:37,765
- Right?
- Dad, really?

861
01:10:37,865 --> 01:10:40,560
Calm down. It's a former cemetery.
Former.

862
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,520
They moved the bodies a long time ago.

863
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:45,231
- They relocated...
- They moved them to a nicer neighborhood.

864
01:10:45,331 --> 01:10:47,191
I don't think that they are.

865
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:50,862
I think they just told people
they moved the cemetery.

866
01:10:50,962 --> 01:10:53,364
I think they just moved the headstones.

867
01:10:53,464 --> 01:10:55,514
And they left the bodies?

868
01:10:57,885 --> 01:10:58,925
Oh, my God.

869
01:10:59,929 --> 01:11:03,458
This isn't just a few pissed off spirits
that we're dealing with.

870
01:11:03,558 --> 01:11:07,253
This is unlike anything
that I've ever felt before.

871
01:11:07,353 --> 01:11:10,173
This is... It's more like a mob.

872
01:11:10,273 --> 01:11:13,676
They suffered a terrible injustice...

873
01:11:13,776 --> 01:11:18,776
and that anger and frustration
has created a new, more powerful force.

874
01:11:19,907 --> 01:11:21,809
The poltergeist.

875
01:11:21,909 --> 01:11:24,562
They are trapped and they are desperate.

876
01:11:24,662 --> 01:11:28,274
And your daughter is their ticket
out of this purgatory.

877
01:11:28,374 --> 01:11:30,526
What do they want with her?

878
01:11:30,626 --> 01:11:33,376
They want her to be their lantern
in the darkness.

879
01:11:34,172 --> 01:11:36,172
To lead them into the light.

880
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,331
What happens if she goes into the light?

881
01:11:43,431 --> 01:11:46,351
There's no getting her back
if she does that.

882
01:11:46,684 --> 01:11:49,104
Just because he said that,
it doesn't mean...

883
01:11:49,979 --> 01:11:51,729
that's true, okay?

884
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,927
Nothing you've said makes sense to me.

885
01:11:56,027 --> 01:11:58,846
And everything else does, right?

886
01:11:58,946 --> 01:12:01,474
The closet, the tree,
the smoldering hole in the ceiling.

887
01:12:01,574 --> 01:12:04,143
All that makes sense to you,
but I'm full of crap.

888
01:12:04,243 --> 01:12:06,203
I don't know, okay? I don't know.

889
01:12:07,872 --> 01:12:10,525
We just want our daughter back, okay?

890
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:12,860
We just want our daughter back.

891
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,821
Eric, I know exactly how you feel.

892
01:12:14,921 --> 01:12:15,989
I don't know if you do.

893
01:12:16,089 --> 01:12:19,534
I've felt it every single day
of my entire life.

894
01:12:19,634 --> 01:12:24,122
It is hard to know what to believe in,
but I am here to help.

895
01:12:24,222 --> 01:12:26,312
You believe that, don't you?

896
01:12:31,145 --> 01:12:32,145
Okay.

897
01:12:34,774 --> 01:12:37,194
You're all I've got, so let's do it.

898
01:13:00,258 --> 01:13:02,327
Everybody gets a GPS tracker.

899
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
This is gonna tell us
where you are, anytime...
in case anything gets weird.

900
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,878
What am I supposed to do with this?

901
01:13:11,978 --> 01:13:13,478
Just put it in your pocket.

902
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:29,896
Weird, right?

903
01:13:29,996 --> 01:13:31,206
Yeah.

904
01:13:31,789 --> 01:13:32,869
What's with the leg?

905
01:13:33,499 --> 01:13:35,079
I don't know.

906
01:13:36,377 --> 01:13:38,087
Can you show me how to fly this thing?

907
01:13:38,755 --> 01:13:40,031
Okay.

908
01:13:40,131 --> 01:13:42,551
It's kind of complicated.
Do you want me to fly it?

909
01:13:43,593 --> 01:13:45,223
I can handle it.

910
01:13:46,554 --> 01:13:49,314
You gonna ask me about it,
or just stare at my leg the whole day?

911
01:13:50,558 --> 01:13:52,388
I don't know what you're talking about.

912
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:55,088
Let's just get this over with, shall we?

913
01:13:55,188 --> 01:13:56,673
What are you doing?

914
01:13:56,773 --> 01:13:59,483
No, no, no. We don't need to see that.
That's weird.

915
01:14:00,652 --> 01:14:02,387
What happened to you?

916
01:14:02,487 --> 01:14:04,305
Portugal, 2003.

917
01:14:04,405 --> 01:14:06,766
There was a monastery
in the forest of Bussaco...

918
01:14:06,866 --> 01:14:09,102
with a particularly nasty entity.

919
01:14:09,202 --> 01:14:11,412
And you got rid of it?

920
01:14:11,746 --> 01:14:14,649
Not before it took
a piece of my leg with it.

921
01:14:14,749 --> 01:14:16,901
Okay, thank you for that. That's gross.

922
01:14:17,001 --> 01:14:19,301
I'm gonna go throw up. Thanks.

923
01:14:23,633 --> 01:14:24,933
And what about that one?

924
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:29,038
That's a good story.

925
01:14:29,138 --> 01:14:32,138
Let's save that for
after this is all over, shall we?

926
01:14:32,725 --> 01:14:34,635
Assuming you don't die.

927
01:14:38,314 --> 01:14:39,574
Okay.

928
01:14:41,192 --> 01:14:43,572
- Why do you do that?
- What?

929
01:14:44,028 --> 01:14:45,889
You tell your old war stories...

930
01:14:45,989 --> 01:14:47,974
and you make yourself
sound like an old man.

931
01:14:48,074 --> 01:14:49,244
Comes with the territory.

932
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:51,477
We age in dog years.

933
01:14:51,577 --> 01:14:53,271
Do you have kids, Mr. Burke?

934
01:14:53,371 --> 01:14:54,814
Sadly, no.

935
01:14:54,914 --> 01:14:57,734
My wife didn't think it was a good idea
given our line of work.

936
01:14:57,834 --> 01:14:59,424
It wasn't just the work.

937
01:15:02,338 --> 01:15:04,574
- The two of you were...
- Briefly.

938
01:15:04,674 --> 01:15:06,159
We were young and stupid.

939
01:15:06,259 --> 01:15:07,577
Only one of us was stupid.

940
01:15:07,677 --> 01:15:10,830
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I was irresistible back then.

941
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:12,957
I'm gonna go check
the readings upstairs.

942
01:15:13,057 --> 01:15:15,585
And she goes,
just like she fled our marriage.

943
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:19,839
Straight into the arms of academia.
Safe, stable academia.

944
01:15:19,939 --> 01:15:21,674
- Still misses me though.
- No, I don't.

945
01:15:21,774 --> 01:15:22,842
You do, a little.

946
01:15:22,942 --> 01:15:24,260
No, not even a little bit.

947
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,055
She forgets I can sense these things.

948
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:28,848
I have special powers, you know.

949
01:15:28,948 --> 01:15:31,118
They're not that special.

950
01:15:32,952 --> 01:15:33,952
You all right?

951
01:15:35,038 --> 01:15:36,272
I'm a little scared.

952
01:15:36,372 --> 01:15:37,941
Yeah.

953
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:39,317
Me too.

954
01:15:39,417 --> 01:15:41,917
What are we gonna do about that?

955
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,090
I don't know.

956
01:15:45,131 --> 01:15:46,301
Think about Maddy?

957
01:15:46,632 --> 01:15:47,882
Let's try that.

958
01:15:54,098 --> 01:15:56,000
Feeling less scared?

959
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:57,430
No, not really.

960
01:15:58,311 --> 01:15:59,601
Yeah, me neither.

961
01:16:02,231 --> 01:16:03,481
I feel a little braver, though.

962
01:16:04,651 --> 01:16:06,031
Me too.

963
01:16:06,569 --> 01:16:07,971
We're good.

964
01:16:08,071 --> 01:16:10,111
Brooke, video's up!

965
01:16:10,448 --> 01:16:12,642
- Let's go.
- We're all set to go down here.

966
01:16:12,742 --> 01:16:16,082
Kendra, would you ever throw me
that belt that's in that bag there?

967
01:16:18,414 --> 01:16:20,924
All right, just so we're all clear.

968
01:16:21,793 --> 01:16:25,633
First, we use the rope to bridge
the way in to the way out.

969
01:16:28,299 --> 01:16:30,660
The rules are different in there.

970
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:34,080
There is no up, there is no down...

971
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,640
and there are no straight lines.

972
01:16:37,475 --> 01:16:40,345
Which is why we have to make one.

973
01:16:41,062 --> 01:16:43,089
This rope is our lifeline.

974
01:16:43,189 --> 01:16:47,859
If we let go of it,
we'll never find our way back.

975
01:16:50,863 --> 01:16:52,283
It worked!

976
01:16:57,537 --> 01:16:59,022
Once we've done that...

977
01:16:59,122 --> 01:17:01,372
we send the drone in
to get eyes on Maddy.

978
01:18:36,552 --> 01:18:38,802
Keep it steady, now. Keep it steady.

979
01:18:40,181 --> 01:18:41,811
Keep it steady there, Griffin.

980
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:46,750
Maddy!

981
01:19:47,206 --> 01:19:48,206
Maddy?

982
01:19:50,335 --> 01:19:51,345
Mommy.

983
01:19:52,211 --> 01:19:53,196
Mommy?

984
01:19:53,296 --> 01:19:54,296
Maddy.

985
01:19:54,839 --> 01:19:55,969
Mommy?

986
01:19:56,716 --> 01:19:57,909
Maddy?

987
01:19:58,009 --> 01:19:59,494
- Madison, can you hear me?
- Mommy.

988
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:01,514
Madison! Madison?

989
01:20:03,473 --> 01:20:08,169
Madison, honey.
Maddy, sweetheart, it's Mommy.

990
01:20:08,269 --> 01:20:10,024
- Mommy?
- Maddy?

991
01:20:10,938 --> 01:20:11,938
Daddy?

992
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,910
Madison! Madison!

993
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:23,309
- No! I'm going in.
- Listen to me, Eric.

994
01:20:23,409 --> 01:20:25,603
- I am her mother. I have to go.
- Mom, you can't!

995
01:20:25,703 --> 01:20:26,896
You're not going in!

996
01:20:26,996 --> 01:20:29,816
She's too close to the light.
I gotta go in and get her out.

997
01:20:29,916 --> 01:20:31,818
No, I'm going. You can't go.
She won't come to a stranger.

998
01:20:31,918 --> 01:20:33,152
You've never done this before.

999
01:20:33,252 --> 01:20:36,222
- You have no idea what you're dealing with.
- All right, I'm going!

1000
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:40,076
Sort all this out in family therapy.
We've got to get her out of there.

1001
01:20:40,176 --> 01:20:42,296
Wait, everyone, stop!
Griffin is already upstairs.

1002
01:20:42,679 --> 01:20:45,259
Griff! Oh, my God! Griff!

1003
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Griffin!
Griffin!
I should have never left her alone.

1004
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,400
No!

1005
01:20:57,276 --> 01:20:59,896
Griffin! No!

1006
01:21:06,869 --> 01:21:08,699
Griffin!

1007
01:21:09,414 --> 01:21:10,714
Griffin!

1008
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:13,328
No!

1009
01:21:14,127 --> 01:21:17,780
Go downstairs! Grab ahold of the rope!

1010
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,826
When I give you the signal,
pull with all your might!

1011
01:21:21,926 --> 01:21:23,578
What if it doesn't work?

1012
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:24,787
Amy.

1013
01:21:24,887 --> 01:21:26,177
Sweetheart...

1014
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:28,678
it's gonna work.

1015
01:21:34,147 --> 01:21:35,307
This better work!

1016
01:21:36,733 --> 01:21:38,573
You said you could
talk to these things, right?

1017
01:21:38,943 --> 01:21:41,363
Tell them it's time to let Maddy go!

1018
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:44,659
I'm counting on you!

1019
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:02,242
This child has done you no harm.

1020
01:22:02,342 --> 01:22:04,142
She speaks none harm.

1021
01:22:09,474 --> 01:22:10,774
Wait.

1022
01:22:12,518 --> 01:22:13,461
Wait.

1023
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:16,731
No, no, no. He's off the screen.
We lost him.

1024
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:23,737
Maddy?

1025
01:22:30,161 --> 01:22:31,201
Maddy?

1026
01:22:39,295 --> 01:22:40,335
Maddy?

1027
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,340
Griffin?

1028
01:23:00,024 --> 01:23:02,694
Maddy, we have to go.

1029
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:05,054
I can't.

1030
01:23:05,154 --> 01:23:07,824
Yes, you can. We have to go now.

1031
01:23:19,544 --> 01:23:21,844
They'll never let me leave.

1032
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:26,593
The rope!

1033
01:23:33,516 --> 01:23:34,516
The rope!

1034
01:23:48,364 --> 01:23:49,374
Run, Maddy, come on!

1035
01:24:05,089 --> 01:24:07,379
Maddy! Griffin!

1036
01:24:07,717 --> 01:24:08,743
Oh, my God.

1037
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:10,828
I got you, my babies.
You'll be okay. Oh, my God.

1038
01:24:10,928 --> 01:24:12,288
They have a pulse.

1039
01:24:12,388 --> 01:24:13,581
Eric!

1040
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:15,708
They're breathing. She's breathing.

1041
01:24:15,808 --> 01:24:17,210
Mommy's right here.

1042
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:18,378
Jesus! God!

1043
01:24:18,478 --> 01:24:19,768
Are they okay?

1044
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:22,048
- What do we do?
- Get them in the water now!

1045
01:24:22,148 --> 01:24:23,648
Okay, come on.

1046
01:24:23,983 --> 01:24:25,385
Wake up, baby.

1047
01:24:25,485 --> 01:24:26,678
Okay, sweetheart.

1048
01:24:26,778 --> 01:24:28,263
Come on, baby, wake up.

1049
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:30,098
Can you hear me? Can you hear Momma?

1050
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:31,724
All right, wake up, sweetheart.

1051
01:24:31,824 --> 01:24:33,226
Come on.

1052
01:24:33,326 --> 01:24:35,395
Griffin, please wake up. Please.

1053
01:24:35,495 --> 01:24:38,175
- I'm counting on you, buddy.
- I need you to wake up right now.

1054
01:24:38,998 --> 01:24:40,650
Good boy! Good boy!

1055
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,652
- There he is!
- Is Maddy okay?

1056
01:24:42,752 --> 01:24:44,112
- Yeah, Maddy's okay.
- Is Maddy okay?

1057
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:45,321
Maddy's gonna be okay.

1058
01:24:45,421 --> 01:24:47,511
- Can you hear Momma?
- Come on, sweetheart.

1059
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,260
Please wake up. Please wake up.

1060
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:54,581
Oh, sweetheart! Oh, baby!

1061
01:24:54,681 --> 01:24:57,083
Hi, sweetheart. Hi, sweetheart.

1062
01:24:57,183 --> 01:24:59,502
Hi, Mommy. Hi, Daddy.

1063
01:24:59,602 --> 01:25:00,753
Hi.

1064
01:25:00,853 --> 01:25:02,130
Hi, sweetheart.

1065
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:03,900
It's okay, Mommy.

1066
01:25:04,524 --> 01:25:05,758
Griffin saved me.

1067
01:25:05,858 --> 01:25:07,760
Yeah, he did. You know why?

1068
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:09,971
Because you're our super boy.

1069
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:11,701
Yeah. Yeah.

1070
01:25:13,366 --> 01:25:15,366
I love you, two. I love you, Daddy.

1071
01:25:16,119 --> 01:25:18,699
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1072
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,325
All right, hop in your seat.

1073
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:32,202
Are we ever coming back?

1074
01:25:32,302 --> 01:25:34,829
No, sweetie. There's no way in hell.

1075
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:36,873
Okay, seatbelt.

1076
01:25:36,973 --> 01:25:39,353
Hey, thanks for everything...

1077
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:41,691
and I hope we never see you again.

1078
01:25:42,186 --> 01:25:44,214
I don't know why they always say that.

1079
01:25:44,314 --> 01:25:45,364
- Bye.
- Bye.

1080
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:50,986
So tell me. I deserve it.

1081
01:25:55,867 --> 01:25:58,577
Burbank, California, 2012.

1082
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:02,710
We were shooting an episode
in a haunted car wash.

1083
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:06,496
And the sound guy fell asleep.

1084
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:09,113
- So, not a ghost?
- No.

1085
01:26:09,213 --> 01:26:14,223
Just a dozy boom operator
with a very, very large microphone.

1086
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:19,473
Do the line.

1087
01:26:19,891 --> 01:26:21,042
I'm not saying it.

1088
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:22,627
Mom, it's for Lauren.

1089
01:26:22,727 --> 01:26:24,227
Burke, give her the line!

1090
01:26:25,563 --> 01:26:26,613
The house is clean.

1091
01:26:27,065 --> 01:26:28,115
Better. Come on.

1092
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:31,427
The house is clean.

1093
01:26:31,527 --> 01:26:32,987
Oh, my God! She's gonna freak.

1094
01:26:34,238 --> 01:26:36,099
"This house is clean."

1095
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:37,517
It isn't though.

1096
01:26:37,617 --> 01:26:39,185
Of course it is, sweetheart.

1097
01:26:39,285 --> 01:26:41,312
You helped the spirits
go into the light.

1098
01:26:41,412 --> 01:26:42,872
But they didn't.

1099
01:26:44,707 --> 01:26:45,775
- Dad, go!
- Dad, go!

1100
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:47,610
They didn't go into the light, Mommy.

1101
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:50,488
They needed me to take them
but I wouldn't go in...

1102
01:26:50,588 --> 01:26:52,258
so neither did they.

1103
01:26:53,049 --> 01:26:54,089
- Dad, go!
- Go!

1104
01:26:59,597 --> 01:27:01,097
Get out of the car.

1105
01:27:36,676 --> 01:27:38,086
Honey, you okay?

1106
01:27:38,678 --> 01:27:39,871
You okay?

1107
01:27:39,971 --> 01:27:41,206
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah.

1108
01:27:41,306 --> 01:27:42,457
Eric. Eric.

1109
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:44,427
Here, baby. Hold on.

1110
01:27:45,977 --> 01:27:46,977
Where's Maddy?

1111
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:49,547
Where is she? Where is she?

1112
01:27:49,647 --> 01:27:50,767
Maddy!

1113
01:27:51,316 --> 01:27:52,476
Mommy.

1114
01:27:53,526 --> 01:27:55,526
Something's wrong, Mom.

1115
01:27:57,947 --> 01:27:58,681
Maddy!

1116
01:27:58,781 --> 01:27:59,871
- Oh, God!
- Mom!

1117
01:28:16,215 --> 01:28:17,755
Maddy!

1118
01:28:26,809 --> 01:28:28,479
- Mom! Mom!
- Maddy!

1119
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:30,129
Mom!

1120
01:28:30,229 --> 01:28:31,798
- Hold on!
- Mom! Mom!

1121
01:28:31,898 --> 01:28:33,675
Come on, baby. Come on.

1122
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:34,785
Mommy!

1123
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:38,070
Come on, baby.

1124
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:39,446
Hold on!

1125
01:29:02,053 --> 01:29:03,621
Pull!

1126
01:29:03,721 --> 01:29:05,351
Pull!

1127
01:29:08,101 --> 01:29:10,879
Release your hold on this family...

1128
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:13,769
as you yourselves wish to be released...

1129
01:29:27,745 --> 01:29:29,272
No. Don't do something stupid.

1130
01:29:29,372 --> 01:29:32,191
I always do something stupid.
Isn't that why you left me?

1131
01:29:32,291 --> 01:29:33,484
Carrigan, please.

1132
01:29:33,584 --> 01:29:35,570
They're never gonna let this family go.

1133
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:37,630
I'm tired of faking it
for the cameras, Brooke.

1134
01:29:38,548 --> 01:29:41,878
I'm the only one left who can lead
those souls into the light. You know that.

1135
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:43,912
Wait!

1136
01:29:44,012 --> 01:29:45,622
You don't have to do this.

1137
01:29:45,722 --> 01:29:47,832
I know. I want to.

1138
01:29:47,932 --> 01:29:48,917
Wait.

1139
01:29:49,017 --> 01:29:51,085
How will I know that
you've made it back?

1140
01:29:51,185 --> 01:29:53,171
I'll think of something.

1141
01:29:53,271 --> 01:29:54,361
Bye, Brooke.

1142
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:02,320
Amy, come here.

1143
01:30:02,613 --> 01:30:04,163
Let's go.

1144
01:30:08,911 --> 01:30:10,251
Maddy!

1145
01:30:10,747 --> 01:30:11,997
Let's go! Come on.

1146
01:30:16,919 --> 01:30:20,796
- Watch your head. Let's go.
- Maddy. Okay, let's go.

1147
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:30,750
Mommy's gonna get you.

1148
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:31,834
No!

1149
01:30:31,934 --> 01:30:34,295
Kendra! Come here. Let's go!

1150
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:36,047
I'm sorry I'm such a bitch to you, Dad.

1151
01:30:36,147 --> 01:30:38,187
It's okay, honey.
Can we talk about it later? Let's go.

1152
01:30:43,946 --> 01:30:45,066
Oh, shit.

1153
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:55,608
Hey!

1154
01:30:55,708 --> 01:30:56,788
What are you doing?

1155
01:30:57,377 --> 01:30:59,995
- I've got a job to do!
- Wait!

1156
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:11,274
Dad!

1157
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:23,261
Amy, we gotta find a car.

1158
01:31:23,361 --> 01:31:26,161
Eric, take mine. Go!

1159
01:31:31,244 --> 01:31:32,294
Mom!

1160
01:31:36,874 --> 01:31:38,424
Come on! Let's go!

1161
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:16,792
Dad, is it gonna follow us?

1162
01:32:18,124 --> 01:32:21,174
Griff, don't look back. Don't look back.

1163
01:33:24,691 --> 01:33:26,481
Any sign of him?

1164
01:33:30,863 --> 01:33:33,123
Nothing. The GPS isn't picking him up.

1165
01:33:38,413 --> 01:33:40,923
Wait. We're getting something.

1166
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:57,123
- Hello!
- Hi.

1167
01:33:57,223 --> 01:33:59,834
Hello! You obviously found it okay.

1168
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:01,127
Isn't it beautiful?

1169
01:34:01,227 --> 01:34:03,630
I think this one is it.
Great school district...

1170
01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:05,798
the high school ball field's close by.

1171
01:34:05,898 --> 01:34:07,133
Wait till you see the inside.

1172
01:34:07,233 --> 01:34:08,384
Four proper bedrooms...

1173
01:34:08,484 --> 01:34:10,534
and the place is just swimming
in closet space.

1174
01:34:11,738 --> 01:34:13,640
That's not really high on our wish list.

1175
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:15,740
Our last closet ate me.

1176
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:17,909
That's sweet.

1177
01:34:19,412 --> 01:34:21,981
Anyway, this house
just screams character.

1178
01:34:22,081 --> 01:34:24,751
Look at the wainscoting.
And in here is the foyer.

1179
01:34:25,084 --> 01:34:26,986
Period detail throughout.

1180
01:34:27,086 --> 01:34:28,363
And this is the den.

1181
01:34:28,463 --> 01:34:31,324
The den leads right into the back yard.
Perfect for the kids.

1182
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:34,344
And do you see that tree?
It's ancient. It was here before...

1183
01:34:34,927 --> 01:34:36,137
Hello?

1184
01:34:37,305 --> 01:34:38,475
Hello?

1185
01:34:40,433 --> 01:34:41,523
Perfect.

1186
01:34:42,602 --> 01:34:44,272
Let's get out of here.

1187
01:35:36,906 --> 01:35:41,144
Is this labyrinthine network
of sewers playing host...

1188
01:35:41,244 --> 01:35:42,834
to a malevolent spirit?

1189
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:46,608
I'm Carrigan Burke, and I'm here to...

1190
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:49,110
And I'm Brooke Powell,
and we're here to clean house.

1191
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:51,070
- I hadn't finished!
- I'm sorry. Was that not my cue?

1192
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:52,280
- I hadn't finished my line.
- I'm sorry.

1193
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:55,116
And we're not saying "clean house."
We cut that.

1194
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:58,328
Because I thought that my cue was
when you said, "And I'm Carrigan Burke."

1195
01:35:58,428 --> 01:36:00,163
- I didn't even say that.
- As soon as I heard "and"...

1196
01:36:00,263 --> 01:36:01,331
I just came right out.

1197
01:36:01,431 --> 01:36:02,916
That's the wrong one, though.

1198
01:36:03,016 --> 01:36:04,176
Okay.

1199
01:36:08,021 --> 01:36:10,191
Does someone wanna tell me
the right one?
