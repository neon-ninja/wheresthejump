1
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,510
Hey!

2
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,150
So, did you get it?

3
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:16,693
Have you got it installed yet?

4
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,133
Okay.

5
00:01:19,134 --> 00:01:20,189
Yeah, no, it's great.

6
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,659
I'm looking at myself right now.

7
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,265
You're missing out.

8
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:26,403
Okay, I'll send you an invite.

9
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:36,819
- Hey!
- Hey!

10
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,329
How's it going? Look at you!
- Good, good!

11
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,499
How are you?

12
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,309
I'm good! It's good to
see your virtual face.

13
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,563
Yeah, same, oh my gosh.

14
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,169
So, welcome to the future.

15
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,419
Yeah, right?

16
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,539
I'm still stuck in the past, I guess.

17
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,109
I'm trying to match your speed.

18
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,489
Well, I mean, I love this.

19
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,619
I'll never have to leave the house again.

20
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,739
And why would you?

21
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,769
I mean, you have a nice pad!

22
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,289
Ah, thank you.

23
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,259
Yeah, I guess I'm-
- How's San Fran?

24
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,269
Yeah, it's good!

25
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,329
It's been kind of weird.

26
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,939
There was a bit of culture shock at first,

27
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,449
but I got used to it.

28
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,039
A culture shock.

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,409
Okay, what is it,

30
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,423
bougie, or is it not
bougie, or what is it?

31
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,600
It's kinda hard to explain, but,

32
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,129
basically, it's really loud here,

33
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,969
and I wasn't used to that.

34
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,793
And it's buildings, and
people, and cars, and,

35
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,649
yeah, it's a little bit,
it's a little bit much.

36
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,669
But you sort of get numb to it,

37
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,389
so I'm enjoying that.

38
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,873
So, how are you?

39
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:52,513
You're still in San Antonio?

40
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,539
Unfortunately.

41
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,473
It looks like I might die here.

42
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,723
Yeah, I mean,

43
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,619
my college degree in history
isn't doing me any favors,

44
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,769
but oh well.

45
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,909
I mean, there's worse things

46
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,469
than breakfast tacos and clubbing.

47
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,479
At least I've got my own space now!

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,089
Yeah, I was gonna say, it's nice!

49
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,969
I don't see your mom anywhere.

50
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,429
That's right, that's right.

51
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,811
I'm not solo, I have a
roommate, but you know,

52
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:25,019
it's not bad.

53
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,649
I finally cut the cord, out on my own.

54
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,229
Okay, all right!

55
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,659
Now, how about you?

56
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,479
I mean, we've been talking
about me the whole time.

57
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,189
I noticed you've got

58
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,709
a pretty extensive collection behind you.

59
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,109
How's the new place?

60
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,479
It's been good.

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,349
Yeah, I definitely
expanded my video library.

62
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,819
I actually sold some records.

63
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,339
But it's kind of this,
and then a kitchenette,

64
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,569
an en suite, and then I've
got a fold out couch bed,

65
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,823
but it's too small for me
to actually fold it out.

66
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,689
So, that was kinda depressing.

67
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,149
But it's good.

68
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,149
I just, you know, it's everything I need.

69
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,143
Oh, my imagination is running wild.

70
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,108
How about things with, what's his name?

71
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,139
Donny, David, right?

72
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,140
Da-veed?

73
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,219
Of course I can't even
pronounce the most basic name.

74
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,969
How are things with Da-veed?

75
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,973
Yeah, okay, so,

76
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,913
believe it or not, that
didn't last super long.

77
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,139
Yeah, because I moved out here for him,

78
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,529
and we were doing the
open relationship thing,

79
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,219
and he managed to cheat on
me, which is hard.

80
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,593
In an open relationship.

81
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,273
Yeah, lines were crossed.

82
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,193
I'm sorry, that sucks, Rach.

83
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:04,359
You should follow my lead.

84
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,629
Multiple partners is not the way to go.

85
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,139
I'm loving life with zero partners.

86
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,120
It's working out great.

87
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:12,159
It's going well for me.

88
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,489
Yeah, I don't know.

89
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,519
It's like, I came out here for free love,

90
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,639
and I get no love, but a good video store.

91
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,989
And, you know, that's all I need.

92
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,529
Very comforting.

93
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,549
You moved out there
for him though, right?

94
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,999
Are you gonna, you're
gonna stay out there?

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,009
I think so,

96
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,580
it's just been a little
bit embarrassing, because

97
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:37,759
he left me for this girl that he met

98
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,760
in this real vampire chat room, and-

99
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,253
Vampire chat room?

100
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:48,009
Are you kidding me?

101
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,949
Yeah, real vampire.

102
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,209
Real vampire chat room,

103
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,409
as opposed to fake vampire chat room.

104
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,149
Yeah, 'cause you would think that,

105
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,859
because there are no vampires,

106
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,719
that a real vampire chat room
wouldn't be a thing.

107
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,499
It is a thing.

108
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
It's a thing.

109
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,410
But...

110
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,789
Yeah.
- What is it?

111
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,119
Okay, so it's like a
subset of the goth scene,

112
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,729
where they have little fake names,

113
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,279
and little stick-on fangs,

114
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,269
and soul bonding.

115
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,379
And they are eternal beings

116
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,046
who cannot pay their own rent.

117
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,889
But yeah, I mean, I just need to-

118
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,809
So, you didn't see any red flags when

119
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,319
he didn't have a reflection,

120
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,802
or refused to eat anything with garlic?

121
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,129
Nothing about him?
- I mean,

122
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,069
he's microbiotic anyway,

123
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,829
so I didn't fully comprehend

124
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,169
His dietary restrictions, or whatever.

125
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,183
But yeah, no,

126
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,610
I'm pretty sure he's
not actually a vampire.

127
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,069
Sorry, Jay.

128
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,619
But you're still
gonna stay out there.

129
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,333
Yeah, I'm definitely,
yeah, I've got a job.

130
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:07,751
You've got a job?

131
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:08,969
- Huh?
- Still in film?

132
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,463
You've got a job, still in film?

133
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,849
Kind of. It's mostly video,

134
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,789
but you know, it works.

135
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,869
I clean some films sometimes,

136
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,983
and I've done some PA stuff, but,

137
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,083
hopefully, something will happen.

138
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,583
I mean, that's still amazing.

139
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,279
I mean, that's awesome.

140
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,529
You're doing what you love.

141
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,372
I'm proud of you.

142
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:33,636
Well, you're doing what you love, right?

143
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,286
So, what about Amy?
- Getting there.

144
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:40,639
Why isn't she here, huh?

145
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,039
- What's that?
- Amy!

146
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,890
Amy.

147
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:44,923
Yeah, what are you guys up to?

148
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,483
Was hoping you wouldn't bring that up.

149
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,570
Things are kind of...

150
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,469
I don't know, I haven't
heard from her in a while.

151
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,173
It's been a year or two.

152
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,730
Huh.

153
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:01,134
That's weird.

154
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:02,259
What did you do?

155
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,023
You guys were so close!

156
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,639
Yeah, it's kinda awkward.

157
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,890
So, she...

158
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,859
We were always hanging out together.

159
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,349
You know, you saw the connection,

160
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,789
everybody saw the connection.

161
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,023
It was kind of like,

162
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,529
I thought we were getting along great,

163
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,529
and I figured the next step
was going out on a date,

164
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,379
but she saw us more as just friends.

165
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,079
But I was like, most couples
start out as friends, right?

166
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,153
And to her, she just, you know,

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,213
kind of ghosted me after that.

168
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,233
Oh, man.

169
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:43,373
Well, you know, she doesn't
like labels, so that could be,

170
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,169
could be part of the problem.

171
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,589
But I'm sorry.

172
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,609
I mean, I wasn't asking
for a label, but it's,

173
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,279
whatever, you know, I'm over it.

174
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,449
We've moved on.

175
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,813
I think it's, it's fine.

176
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,957
You haven't talked to her
or anything, have you?

177
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,303
No, not really.

178
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:09,579
Yeah, I admit, I was kinda
distracted when I moved out here,

179
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,889
but I did send her some emails

180
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,589
and never really got a response.

181
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,319
But it's not that big a deal,

182
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,110
'cause when you're close...

183
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,849
You know, I just feel like there's

184
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,299
an unbroken thread between us,

185
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,513
and we don't have to talk every
day, or month, or whatever.

186
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,253
But yeah, I mean, I see
her on AIM all the time.

187
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,739
Huh.

188
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,253
You know, maybe I should
just give her a call.

189
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:42,889
I don't,

190
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,463
I don't think that's the
best idea, to be honest.

191
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:50,503
What other features does this thing have?

192
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,419
Well, we have this
thing called share screen.

193
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,650
So, basically...

194
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,363
What do I do?

195
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:01,389
Okay.

196
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,539
So, we'll be able to
both see the same thing,

197
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,563
and go to websites together.

198
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,333
Okay, let me open up a browser.

199
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,800
Okay, I think...

200
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,593
Okay, I think it's working.

201
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,469
Okay, well, who chooses where we go?

202
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,593
I think we both do.

203
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,853
Nice.

204
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,877
How did that get in there?

205
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:35,493
Okay, no.

206
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,660
Oh, shit.

207
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,870
Oh.

208
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,860
Sorry, I thought I closed that.

209
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:50,259
It's okay, you don't have to delete it.

210
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,260
It's fine.

211
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,388
Oh no, it's just,

212
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:57,119
it's just corrupted or something?

213
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
I don't know.

214
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,100
Okay, I'm gonna give her a call.

215
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,613
Wait, you're not calling her, are you?

216
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,823
Rachel, No!

217
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,159
Hey!

218
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,499
Amy, yeah, it's me!

219
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,419
Oh my god!

220
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,439
Yeah, I'm just talking to Jay right now,

221
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,639
and your name came up.

222
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
Yeah, he's,

223
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,069
yes, yes!

224
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,533
No, he's really sorry for
being such a jerk, oh my god.

225
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,369
Oh my god.

226
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,323
Oh my god, your face.

227
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,949
She didn't answer!

228
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,209
You're being an asshole!

229
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,809
Why would you do that?

230
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,243
I'm sorry, I thought it'd be funny.

231
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,109
Why do you want
to see her so much?

232
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,281
I don't know!

233
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:49,739
It's just, seeing you, and,

234
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,382
you know, we were a bit of a trio.

235
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,230
Okay.

236
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,109
You seem really,

237
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,449
don't worry, it's fine.

238
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,500
I'll just send her...

239
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,700
I'll send her a little message on AIM.

240
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:12,683
Hmm.

241
00:12:14,844 --> 00:12:15,886
What is-

242
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:18,089
"House of Hunger?"

243
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,497
Let me try something.

244
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,289
Okay, so it's a graphic choose
your own adventure type game.

245
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,939
It looks like a,

246
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,509
you know, the,

247
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,029
that's weird, the knocker
looks like a hungry ghost.

248
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,783
A what?

249
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,910
Hold on.

250
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,343
Okay, here it is.

251
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:11,016
"Hungry ghosts, demon-like
creatures described

252
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:13,056
"in Buddhist, Taoist," blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

253
00:13:13,057 --> 00:13:15,016
"Texts about the remnants of the dead

254
00:13:15,017 --> 00:13:17,356
"who are afflicted with insatiable desire,

255
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:19,456
"hunger, or thirst as a result

00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:23,927
"of bad deeds or evil carried
out in their lifetime."

257
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,429
Found in the Far East.

258
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,036
They're "human-like wraiths
with mummified skin,

259
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:32,886
"withered limbs, bulging stomachs,

260
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:34,747
"long necks, and tiny mouths."

261
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,329
Let's play, let's do it.

262
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,163
No!

263
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:40,163
I'm not...

264
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,589
I'm not into this type of stuff.

265
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,439
No, I know you like this stuff,

266
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,429
but I gotta work in the morning.

267
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,459
I'm not trying to play this all night.

268
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,619
But they're hungry, and
they've got long necks!

269
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,620
Come on!

270
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,469
Rachel, I don't like
this weird shit.

271
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,679
Honestly, I think that's
most of the reason

272
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,349
why Amy and I stopped talking.

273
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,339
She's into the weird occult shit,

274
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,309
and no offense to you, I
know you like weird shit too,

275
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,729
but she was just a whole different level.

276
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,279
Wait, my Amy, really?

277
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,069
I mean, she seemed kind
of squeamish, right?

278
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,889
I'm a little bit more
religious, I think she's not.

279
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,792
So, I think the cult stuff is for you, I-

280
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:24,626
Oh.

281
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,803
Okay, one sec.

282
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,739
Hello?

283
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,389
Yeah, hey!

284
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,310
Yeah.

285
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:36,269
I got your email, I did, I'm sorry.

286
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,523
I'm just kind of bad at

287
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:41,599
replying right now.

288
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,253
Yeah, work's been crazy.

289
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,059
Yeah.

290
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,876
Yeah, if you could send
that, that'd be good.

291
00:14:49,877 --> 00:14:51,293
Could you get past cookies?

292
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,963
Oh my god, thank you.

293
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,230
Thank you.

294
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:58,649
Yeah, no, it's good, it's good.

295
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,730
Again, just really busy.

296
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:03,606
Mm-hm.

297
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,284
Okay, I mean, yeah, I'll definitely try

298
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:10,945
and come for Thanksgiving.

299
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:12,516
I said try.

300
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:14,499
I'm not gonna make any promises,

301
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,231
I don't want to break them.

302
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:17,813
Mm-hm, right.

303
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:18,981
Love you, bye.

304
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,899
Sorry. Hey, what's up?

305
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,743
Oh, change your mind, huh?

306
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:29,103
I didn't do anything.

307
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,393
Well, it must've decided for us.

308
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,463
I don't, I didn't click it.

309
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,610
It's probably

310
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,069
automatically set to select yes.

311
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,119
I wouldn't worry about it.

312
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,473
Let's just try it for a few minutes.

313
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,433
Rachel, I have to work in the morning.

314
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,579
Yay!

315
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,763
Okay, do you have any booze in the house?

316
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,529
I live in San Antonio,
what do you think?

317
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,363
Okay, well let's go get a shot,

318
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,703
and let's go meet some hungry ghosts.

319
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,565
All right.

320
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:14,149
See you in a sec!

321
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:35,354
Hey!

322
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:36,763
- Hey.
- Party!

323
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,239
To friends who are uniting

324
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,213
and encountering spooky ghouls.

325
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,893
Spooky ghouls.

326
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:55,954
Oh no!

327
00:16:55,955 --> 00:16:57,653
One second, sorry.

328
00:16:57,654 --> 00:16:59,237
What are you, 12?

329
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,233
I guess it's been a while, ugh.

330
00:17:09,673 --> 00:17:10,943
That was nasty.

331
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,010
All right.

332
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,180
You ready?

333
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,319
I guess so.

334
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Okay.

335
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,353
Let the game begin.

336
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
Hmm.

337
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,733
Amy's name.

338
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:39,929
And it's the only name.

339
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,493
Maybe it's unreleased.

340
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,563
How would Amy be the only
person to play something?

341
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,049
I told you, I'm a big gamer,
I've never heard of this.

342
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,400
Maybe she was the only one.

343
00:18:02,477 --> 00:18:04,310
Are you gonna sign in?

344
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,834
Yeah.

345
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:30,166
"Welcome to the House of Hunger.

346
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,696
"Inside, you will guide yourself

347
00:18:31,697 --> 00:18:33,486

"and lost souls inside.

"Good luck."

358
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Kinda creepy.

359
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:00,740
Yeah, a little bit.

360
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,363
Okay, Mr. Gamer.

361
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,958
What are we looking at?

362
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,859
Well, it's a graphic puzzle adventure.

363
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,039
You click a door, takes
you to another room,

364
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,143
you solve some kind of
puzzle, and then you move on.

365
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,973
Okay.

366
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,003
Which door do we choose first?

367
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,633
The left one, I guess.

368
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,860
What now?

369
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:50,389
I don't know, I don't
see any other doors.

370
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,546
Maybe one of the,

371
00:19:51,547 --> 00:19:54,513
maybe one of the books does something.

372
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:00,496
No, nothing.

373
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,889
What about the desk, or typewriter?

374
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,890
The typewriter?

375
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:08,983
What is that?

376
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:10,997
Where do I know that from, "Six realms?"

377
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:14,710
And there was a hungry
ghost on the door knocker.

378
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:20,391
Hold on.

379
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:21,392
Let's see.

380
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
Yes.

381
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,809
In my Religious Studies class,

382
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:34,689
we actually had this chapter
all about Buddhism and rebirth,

383
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,863
and they talk about six realms.

384
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,949
Here it is.

385
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,843
Yeah, so it was,

386
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,549
six, yeah, Buddhists believe in six realms

387
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,869
that you can be reborn into.

388
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,473
It's Heaven, Asura,

389
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,633
the human, animal, ghost, and Hell.

390
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
Okay.

391
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,592
Hold on.

392
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Anything?

393
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:24,517
There's a book on the
shelf that looks red.

394
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,690
Let me see.

395
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,620
Okay, there we go.

396
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,469
Ugh, I think this might be

397
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,183
a little bit too intense for kids.

398
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,653
Just for kids?

399
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Jesus.

400
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,463
This hallway looks different.

401
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,363
Yeah, it's more modern.

402
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:24,416
Come on.

403
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,939
Are you sure you're doing this right?

404
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,109
We've been down the same hallway 10 times.

405
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,010
Well, there's nothing else to click.

406
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,703
What about the frames,
the frames on the wall?

407
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
Nope.

408
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Nothing.
Here, let me.
Well, shit.

409
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,579
Maybe it's purgatory, or something.

410
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,230
I think we made the wrong choice.

411
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:03,933
What the hell was that?

412
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:06,016
I don't know!

413
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,353
Can you go back?

414
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,090
Wait.

415
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,823
There's something at the
end of the hallway now.

416
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:21,827
Here we go.

417
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,063
Which floor should we go to?

418
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,890
Rachel.

419
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,020
Rachel!

420
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,020
Huh?

421
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:39,918
Yeah...

422
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:42,707
You know the weird thing?

423
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,399
The girl?

424
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Yeah.

425
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,789
Didn't it kind of look like Amy?

426
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,453
Oh my god.

427
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,779
Rachel, it's a game.

428
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,379
It's made of ones and zeros.

429
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,409
Amy is a human.

430
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,979
Okay, it's stupid.

431
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,729
Never mind.

432
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,639
I'm just getting a little spooked,

433
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,383
which I think is the intention.

434
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:11,613
So, floors.

435
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,363
Start at six, work our way back?

436
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:20,219
Hold on, I bet these
six floors all represent

437
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,509
those six realms that
we were talking about.

438
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,609
Oh, what were they?

439
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,799
It's Heaven, Asura, human,
animal, ghost, and Hell.

440
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,139
Okay.

441
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,523
Let's avoid Hell for a second.

442
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,863
That's fair.

443
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,359
How about, human sounds neutral.

444
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,360
Okay.

445
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,813
Human is not as expected!

446
00:24:59,993 --> 00:25:01,917
It's like human suffering.

447
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,950
I guess.

448
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:08,966
Wait, do you hear that?

449
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,967
Is that a voice?

450
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
I hear it.

451
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,150
All right, let's move.

452
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,283
Good idea.

453
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,749
Why don't you pick this time?

454
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,199
Oh, okay.

455
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,099
What did we do last time?

456
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,509
Left?

457
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,019
Yeah.

458
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,683
Okay, let's go right.

459
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,593
Well, great choice.

460
00:25:56,037 --> 00:26:00,286
"If I am not
my body, not my feelings,

461
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:03,363
"not my mind, then what am I?"

462
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,590
You're

463
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,992
nothing.

464
00:26:16,232 --> 00:26:17,232
Huh.

465
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,039
I didn't click it.

466
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Wasn't me.

467
00:26:24,466 --> 00:26:27,689
But it opened right when
you said that.

468
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,509
There's no voice activation.

469
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,863
It's impossible.

470
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,763
It wasn't me.

471
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,010
It's weird.

472
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,080
Never mind.

473
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
Little help?

474
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,070
Jay!

475
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,927
Jay?

476
00:26:57,928 --> 00:26:59,733
I don't wanna play this anymore.

477
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,929
What are you talking about?

478
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,419
It's just a stupid game.

479
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,949
It's getting good!

480
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,793
We're in the center of the game.

481
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,399
No, it's late, I have
to work in the morning.

482
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,719
I gotta go.

483
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,359
Oh, come on, Jay.

484
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,873
We're probably almost done, right?

485
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:20,609
I don't like this occult shit!

486
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,837
It's starting to freak me out!

487
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,670
Amy?

488
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,959
Do I accept?

489
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
No!

490
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,940
Let's just see what she wants.

491
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:55,807
Amy?

492
00:27:59,657 --> 00:28:00,657
Hey, Amy!

493
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,110
Amy, can you hear us?

494
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,060
Hello?

495
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,583
That's enough for me, I'm out.

496
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,907
Jay again, oh my god.

497
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:48,053
What the hell, nothing better to do.

498
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:02,850
Come on.

499
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:13,777
Ugh, fuck.

500
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:41,319
Hey!

501
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,159
No, it's okay, I'm sorry.

502
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,073
It's probably just a glitch
from Hell or something.

503
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,289
I know, I know, it's just,

504
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:53,899
I was trying to play without
you, and it wouldn't let me.

505
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,717
It said, "Waiting for player two."

506
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,960
I know, it's kind of annoying, but

507
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,489
I just feel bad not
finishing it, you know?

508
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,699
I don't want to leave it open.

509
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,083
I need closure, Jay.

510
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,510
Please?

511
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,673
Please.

512
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Please.

513
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,909
Oh my god, amazing, okay.

514
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,199
I will send you an invite,

515
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,750
and I will see you in a second.

516
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

517
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:40,014
Hey.

518
00:30:41,997 --> 00:30:42,997
Hey!

519
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,729
How's it going?

520
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,096
Rach, you look a little on edge.

521
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,520
Ah, no, sorry, I'm just...

522
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,449
You know.

523
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,199
We could play some other time.

524
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,879
No, no, no, no, please.

525
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,289
I just, I'm ready.

526
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,853
I won't be able to sleep
unless we finish this.

527
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,269
Listen, it's 2:10 right now.

528
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,343
At three, I have to go.

529
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,469
It's a blast solving all
these Buddhist riddles

530
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:17,159
with you and everything,
but at three, I gotta go.

531
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Is that a deal?

532
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,647
Yes, it's a deal.

533
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:23,648
Good, good.

534
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,879
So, it wouldn't let you play without me?

535
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,339
Yeah, it kept saying,
"Waiting for player two."

536
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,340
That's weird.

537
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:38,963
"Aren't they beautiful?

538
00:31:39,937 --> 00:31:42,413
"Some of the rarest works in the world.

539
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:47,223
"Each painting, a
creation from the creator.

540
00:31:48,057 --> 00:31:52,287
"A painting is complete when
it has the shadow of god."

541
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,939
So, this must be the Asura
realm, or the God realm.

542
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,940
God?

543
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,329
God created the universe, created us.

544
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,439
When we create art,

545
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,597
we're mimicking God.

546
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,700
What?

547
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,689
Oh, nothing, I just,

548
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,793
I guess I kind of forgot
you were religious and shit.

549
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,149
I don't make fun of you

550
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,519
and these trippy games you take me to,

551
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,509
and all these weird riddles.

552
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,999
Actually, I don't even
know what you believe.

553
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,599
What do you believe in?

554
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,373
Let's maybe not go there, okay?

555
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,809
No, I want to know!

556
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,939
What is it?

557
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,773
Tell me.

558
00:32:36,774 --> 00:32:38,749
I'm, you know, I'm a realist.

559
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,823
This is it.

560
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,529
But why?

561
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,143
This is it, why?

562
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,463
I just know, okay?

563
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,020
I...

564
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,029
Okay, this is dumb, but David

565
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:01,310
and his vampire bride...

566
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:06,735
Yeah, when that was going on, it seemed

567
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:08,086
really horrible,

568
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,459
just kind of watching them fall in love.

569
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,849
And obviously, now, I realize that

570
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:21,379
he wasn't the most
amazing man in the world.

571
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,313
But at the time,

572
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,623
at the time,

573
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,149
it seemed like everything was
gonna end when he left me,

574
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:36,853
and I didn't want to
have to deal with that.

575
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,389
I wanted to kinda end it first.

576
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,003
And because I'm kind of
an evil bitch, I guess,

577
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,073
I thought that,

578
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,442
I don't know, that if I
killed myself,

579
00:33:54,443 --> 00:33:55,440
I don't know.

580
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:59,899
But yeah, it wasn't a great choice.

581
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,149
But basically, I got really drunk,

582
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,830
and I took a bunch of pills, and...

583
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,670
I mean...

584
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,849
There was nothing, honestly.

585
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,850
Nothing.

586
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,229
The only light was when I was brought back

587
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:26,879
and I saw the fluorescent
tubes of the hospital.

588
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,310
I woke up with my wrists

589
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,019
tied to a bed, and I was so fucking happy.

590
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,020
But,

591
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,330
now I know.

592
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
Nothing.

593
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,869
Oh, don't look so sad, it's fine.

594
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,759
No, that's really uplifting.

595
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,633
I'm glad to hear that
there's nothing.

596
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,223
I'm glad that you're okay.

597
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:56,699
Yeah.

598
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,419
- Now if you'll-
- Me too!

599
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,579
Come on, haven't you ever
done anything really stupid?

600
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,230
Done a lot of stupid things, but...

601
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,770
I dunno, I hope you change your mind about

602
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,026
the afterlife, just because-

603
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,089
I mean, I have time now, so!

604
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,279
Right.

605
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,188
Well, just 'cause you-
- Anyway!

606
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:20,139
Were lying on a
hospital bed doesn't mean

607
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,683
that you have the answers.

608
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,537
Now, if you'll join me in prayer.

609
00:35:25,538 --> 00:35:26,723
Oh, come on.

610
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:34,003
Okay, no more religious
talk, I'm kidding.

611
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,750
Moving on.

612
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:44,947
"View each painting
carefully and choose one."

613
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,950
Okay.

614
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,610
We should probably stay
away from the gory one.

615
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,489
But maybe this is one of those things

616
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,853
where the one that looks the
worst is actually the best.

617
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,999
It could be, but

618
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,969
why don't we just see
what else is in here?

619
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:07,970
Okay.

620
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,439
Am I tripping,
or does that painting

621
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,513
kind of look like-

622
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,450
Me.

623
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,630
Yeah.

624
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,170
Should we choose it?

625
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,687
Let's skip this one, okay?

626
00:36:45,094 --> 00:36:48,594
I guess this is the only one left.

627
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,003
Seems okay.

628
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,230
Definitely, just a haunted forest.

629
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What's not to like?

630
00:38:02,443 --> 00:38:06,323
That didn't really make any sense, right?

631
00:38:07,158 --> 00:38:08,700
It was the birth of something.

632
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,879
Just like an artist creates a painting,

633
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,053
I think creation is
supposed to represent birth.

634
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,130
Deep.

635
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,820
Okay, looks like we're in

636
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,639
some kind of crypt.

637
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,739
No, catacombs.

638
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,669
Oh yeah, like in Paris!

639
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,220
This one's different, though.

640
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,133
What realm do you think this is?

641
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,489
Judging by the bones,
suffering and death,

642
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,523
I'm guessing Hell.

643
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:54,321
What is that?

644
00:38:54,322 --> 00:38:55,322
What?

645
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:59,999
The shadow thing,
at the end of the hallway?

646
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,989
I don't see anything.

647
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,123
Right there, by the mouse?

648
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,310
Are you gonna go?

649
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,893
Yeah, okay.

650
00:39:29,027 --> 00:39:30,933
"Life is uncertain.

651
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:33,993
"Death is certain."

652
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:40,467
Duh.

653
00:39:44,036 --> 00:39:48,133
Okay, "Daniel, 38,
male, death by drowning.

654
00:39:54,247 --> 00:39:57,593
"David, 45, male, death by unknown.

655
00:40:04,057 --> 00:40:07,720
"Amy, 31, female, death by murder"?

656
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:21,669
What the hell?

657
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,363
Dude, it's like a spirit board.

658
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:29,423
"The spirits from the
other realms await you.

659
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:33,176
"Each player must place two fingers

660
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:36,466
"from each hand on their mouse

661
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,873
"to talk with the other side.

662
00:40:39,827 --> 00:40:43,086
"If anyone lets go of
their mouse at any time,

663
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:47,726
"the session will end immediately.

664
00:40:47,727 --> 00:40:50,023
"Good luck, and remember,

665
00:40:51,217 --> 00:40:52,567
"it's just a game."

666
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,119
Okay, that's my cue.

667
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,123
This is enough spirit stuff for
one night, I think I'm good.

668
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,709
Oh, come on.

669
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,239
I mean, if it were a real board,

670
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,719
and there were candles, and we were naked,

671
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,009
I would get your point.

672
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,209
But come on, ones and zeros.

673
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,769
Doesn't count.

674
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,229
Rachel, this is not just a game.

675
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,819
Virtual checkers is a
game, charades is a game.

676
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,559
This is like what you play before

677
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,789
you're about to tear open a
cat and sacrifice it somewhere.

678
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,773
I don't want any part of this.

679
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,770
Come on.

680
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,601
It's too weird.

681
00:41:31,602 --> 00:41:33,772
Jay, come on,

682
00:41:33,773 --> 00:41:37,805
just go like, put your
little fingers on the mouse.

683
00:41:37,806 --> 00:41:38,929
It'll be fun!

684
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:39,989
We're almost done!

685
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,813
Yay, thank you!

686
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,600
Go ahead, ask the question.

687
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:56,339
What do I ask?

688
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,823
I don't know, you're
the spirit board expert.

689
00:42:04,442 --> 00:42:05,942
Is anyone there?

690
00:42:13,326 --> 00:42:15,636
Did you move it?

691
00:42:15,637 --> 00:42:18,083
No, I swear to God,
I didn't move at all!

692
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,934
How many years have you been dead?

693
00:42:31,395 --> 00:42:32,395
It's her.

694
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,883
What's your name?

695
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,899
What the fuck?

696
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,939
Jay, Jay, don't let go.

697
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,993
Stay there.

698
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,120
If you're...

699
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,570
If you're really Amy, prove it.

700
00:43:29,235 --> 00:43:30,235
Who's that?

701
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,853
Jay?

702
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:36,726
Jay?

703
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:10,143
Jay?

704
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,877
Mom, it's already tomorrow!

705
00:44:22,582 --> 00:44:23,602
No!

706
00:44:23,603 --> 00:44:25,759
No, I'm not watching any
of that stuff anymore!

707
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,843
I'm talking to a real girl!

708
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,609
You owe me some privacy!

709
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:34,763
Go to bed!

710
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,387
Mom, go to bed!

711
00:44:38,864 --> 00:44:39,931
Go to bed!

712
00:44:42,189 --> 00:44:43,189
Ugh.

713
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,213
Sorry, my roommate is just
being ridiculous right now.

714
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,119
Jay?

715
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,120
What?

716
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,223
Your roommate sounds
a lot like your mom.

717
00:44:57,518 --> 00:44:59,168
I thought you said you moved out.

718
00:45:05,547 --> 00:45:08,380
Okay, guilty, guilty as charged.

719
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:12,709
I'm still planning on moving out,

720
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,899
it's just taking a little
bit longer than expected.

721
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,009
And, I don't know, you're
doing all the stuff

722
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,713
in San Francisco, I'm
stuck here in SA, and-

723
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,060
Jay.

724
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,473
Jay, come on.

725
00:45:28,222 --> 00:45:29,699
I don't know.

726
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,529
I just, I thought you'd be honest.

727
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,483
We're really far away from each other.

728
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,263
Honesty helps, okay?

729
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,113
No more lies.

730
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,319
I'm sorry, no more lies.

731
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,320
Promise.

732
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,283
So, what'd I miss?

733
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,683
It just kind of stopped.

734
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,030
Really?

735
00:46:08,203 --> 00:46:11,570
Do I accept?

736
00:46:11,571 --> 00:46:12,821
I don't know.

737
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,147
I mean, it was just
a blank screen before.

738
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,570
Click it.

739
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,219
Amy?

740
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,220
Hello?

741
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:40,410
Amy!

742
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,160
Amy!

743
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:48,683
Are you trying to freak us out?

744
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,530
Amy?

745
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,650
I don't think she's there.

746
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,819
Was she hearing voices when you left?

747
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,610
I mean, this is pretty

748
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,033
weird, Jay.

749
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,690
No.

750
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:15,449
She was normal, or her version of normal,

751
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,219
for a while, and then
she just kind of flipped,

752
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,330
did a 180, and

753
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,649
went from typical Amy

754
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:28,429
to ignoring my calls, emails,

755
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:29,603
shut me out.

756
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,640
I don't know.

757
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:34,987
Did she have a blog?

758
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,639
Oh yeah, she had that stupid,

759
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,819
it was so stupid,

760
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,919
it was "Amy's Hidden Corner," or,

761
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,629
no, it was stupider than
that, it was "Amy's Hideaway"?

762
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:50,846
One sec.

763
00:47:50,847 --> 00:47:51,680
"Amy's..."

764
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,700
No.

765
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:00,156
"Amy's Hidden Nook,"

766
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:02,859
"Amy's Hidden Nook," that's it.

767
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,860
Okay.

768
00:48:05,017 --> 00:48:06,998
N-O-O-K?

769
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:08,913
N-O-O-K, it was so stupid.

770
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,393
Okay, let's see.

771
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:24,090
Looks like she didn't finish it.

772
00:48:27,765 --> 00:48:28,598
No.

773
00:48:28,598 --> 00:48:29,598
What's HOH?

774
00:48:33,716 --> 00:48:34,966
I don't know.

775
00:48:37,662 --> 00:48:39,963
Oh, the game.

776
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,679
She was obsessed.

777
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,023
I told you, she was
obsessed with this book,

778
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,687
was it "Ghosting a Machine"?

779
00:48:50,117 --> 00:48:51,687
"Ghost in the Machine"?

780
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,663
It looks like she thinks
the game is haunted.

781
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,500
I'm starting to believe it.

782
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,543
Okay, videos.

783
00:49:14,578 --> 00:49:16,459
Well, let's check them out.

784
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,659
Can we close Amy's chat window?

785
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,393
It's just starting to creep me out.

786
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:26,177
Let's just wait, maybe she
left for a bit, you know?

787
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:41,465
What is that?

788
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:53,225
Fuck.

789
00:50:44,621 --> 00:50:46,393
Oh my god!

790
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,560
They're trying to
summon the hungry ghost.

791
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,959
The heart was some kind of offering.

792
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,110
They feast on the dead.

793
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,400
Was...

794
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,103
Jay, in the video,

795
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:08,950
was that Amy?

796
00:51:08,951 --> 00:51:11,809
I told you she
went off the deep end.

797
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:12,810
I mean...

798
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,543
One video left.

799
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,300
Part two?

800
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:30,950
Is this a picture?

801
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:34,103
I think,

802
00:51:34,104 --> 00:51:36,069
I think it's like a live stream.

803
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:38,693
But who would live stream a graveyard?

804
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,440
There's something there in the back.

805
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,669
I don't see anything.

806
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:50,220
Can you raise the brightness?

807
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:54,940
Okay.

808
00:51:58,989 --> 00:51:59,989
There we go.

809
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,077
Shit.
- That's Amy.

810
00:52:14,206 --> 00:52:15,349
No it's not.

811
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:17,503
That's Amy, it's her.

812
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,723
Wait, the graveyard.

813
00:52:24,212 --> 00:52:25,283
It's from the game.

814
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:30,427
Is this from the same live stream?

815
00:52:34,853 --> 00:52:36,103
I don't know.

816
00:52:37,853 --> 00:52:38,853
But

817
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:42,033
the woman is still there, Jay.

818
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,733
Let me see if we can still move.

819
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,740
That's Amy, I'm telling you.

820
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:05,013
That's Amy's shirt.

821
00:53:06,297 --> 00:53:07,297
Fuck.

822
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

823
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,257
How?
- Close it!

824
00:53:23,258 --> 00:53:25,929
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.

825
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,730
I don't want to play this anymore!

826
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:29,943
I don't either!

827
00:53:41,245 --> 00:53:43,673
Amy?

828
00:53:43,674 --> 00:53:44,674
Amy.

829
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,589
Amy, are you there?

830
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,019
Amy.

831
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,764
Amy. Amy, we just saw you.
- She's not gonna want

832
00:53:50,765 --> 00:53:51,598
to talk to us.

833
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,339
Could you come out
and talk to us, please?

834
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,839
- She's crazy.
- Amy, we just want to know

835
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,859
what's going on here, okay?

836
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,529
I'm telling you, she's twisted.

837
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:59,939
She's messed up in the head.

838
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,299
She's not gonna do it.

839
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,899
Jay, what the fuck?

840
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,900
Amy!

841
00:54:05,406 --> 00:54:06,406
Amy.

842
00:54:08,823 --> 00:54:10,573
We just want to talk.

843
00:54:13,103 --> 00:54:14,103
Amy?

844
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:23,131
Wait a second, do you hear that?

845
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,476
That's not her voice.

846
00:54:26,477 --> 00:54:28,629
Who the fuck else would it be?

847
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:29,630
Amy!

848
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,410
Amy!

849
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:42,650
Jay?

850
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,540
You still live in the same place, yeah?

851
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:50,803
Really close to Amy,
right, a couple blocks?

852
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,150
Yeah.

853
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:58,209
I think you should probably
go check on her, okay?

854
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,093
Hell no, are you crazy?

855
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,763
But I mean, please, she could be hurt.

856
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,679
I just, please.

857
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,630
Or she could be waiting with a knife.

858
00:55:14,763 --> 00:55:16,573
Okay.

859
00:55:17,682 --> 00:55:19,141
I think we should call the police.

860
00:55:19,142 --> 00:55:21,927
No, no police, no police, uh-uh.

861
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:25,173
No police.

862
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:30,750
Why?

863
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:35,453
I might've made a teensy mistake.

864
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,409
Jay, what the fuck did you do?

865
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:42,639
You said it yourself,
we were inseparable.

866
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,949
We were hanging out all the
time, we were best friends.

867
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:48,089
And I agree with you, everybody saw it.

868
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:49,699
We're together, we're laughing,

869
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,289
we're enjoying each other's company,

870
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:52,529
so I ask her out on a date,

871
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:55,609
and she shuts down.

872
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:57,749
She rejects me.

873
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,830
And not only did I lose

874
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:04,369
just the possibility of a
relationship with my best friend,

875
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:05,639
but I lost my best friend.

876
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,329
I lost everything.

877
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,609
And so, I hacked into her computer,

878
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,329
I blocked her family and friends

879
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,700
so that she would maybe think that

880
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:19,009
they weren't there for her, and I was.

881
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:20,010
So...

882
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,909
I just don't want the police
to see all that stuff.

883
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:26,223
I think it could go horribly wrong.

884
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:32,557
You fucking bastard.

885
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,990
When I, she...

886
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:41,861
You didn't even fucking-

887
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,409
It wasn't my proudest moment,

888
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:45,989
I admit it, it was wrong,

889
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,879
I shouldn't have done that.

890
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,659
But I've moved on, she's moved on,

891
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:53,993
I think everybody's moved
on, I figure we can move on!

892
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,140
I regret it!

893
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,693
You fucking regret it!

894
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:02,693
Jay, go now!

895
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:07,959
Go right now, and you
make sure that she's okay.

896
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,939
If you do not go, I will call the police,

897
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,223
I promise you.

898
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,179
Fine!

899
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,653
I'll go, okay?

900
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,790
Does that work for you?

901
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:21,999
Yes.

902
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It's gonna take,

903
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:26,133
I don't know, she's five minutes away.

904
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:30,100
I will call the police in 10
minutes if you're not there.

905
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:33,913
I am sorry.

906
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:50,710
Amy!

907
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,963
Amy, I hope you're there.

908
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,500
Amy?

909
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,776
Amy, somebody's coming.

910
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:01,777
Fuck!

911
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,993
She doesn't answer?

912
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,700
I don't know.

913
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:42,390
No.

914
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:44,460
Don't kick the door down.

915
00:58:47,312 --> 00:58:50,347
Can you just use a
credit card or something?

916
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:28,819
Rach.

917
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:29,653
Rach, do you see me?

918
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:30,653
Hey.

919
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,153
Anything?

920
00:59:33,154 --> 00:59:34,250
No sign of her yet.

921
00:59:37,795 --> 00:59:39,545
This place is a mess.

922
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:46,973
Look around, okay?

923
00:59:46,974 --> 00:59:48,643
Just see if you find anything.

924
00:59:57,990 --> 00:59:58,990
Oh, shit.

925
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:01,859
Look familiar?

926
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,383
Holy shit, that's from the game.

927
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,100
There's gotta be

928
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,323
20 paintings of you in here.

929
01:00:21,093 --> 01:00:23,649
Ugh, fuck the paintings.

930
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:24,943
Check her desk, okay?

931
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,734
Looks like she has some, wait, is that,

932
01:00:33,735 --> 01:00:35,859
MiniDV tapes over here.

933
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:36,989
What do they say?

934
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:39,893
It's "House of Hunger," one through six.

935
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,763
Okay, come back and
bring them with you, okay?

936
01:00:44,611 --> 01:00:46,809
It looks like the footage is digitized.

937
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,797
Can you share her screen?

938
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:50,381
I don't know how.

939
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:55,063
Just the little option menu,

940
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,269
in the right.

941
01:00:58,270 --> 01:00:59,829
Is it working?

942
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:00,853
Oh, god.

943
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,361
There's a file named house of hunger.

944
01:01:11,362 --> 01:01:12,362
Click it.

945
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

946
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:28,899
Okay, I'm here.

947
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,023
Where's everybody else?

948
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:37,863
Wow, love what you've done with the place!

949
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,059
Yeah, of course you're sorry!

950
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,403
You're fucking pathetic!

951
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:47,929
You know what, I'm always
here helping you out,

952
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,929
trying to make sure
that everything's okay.

953
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:52,389
What do you ever do for me?

954
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:54,703
I'm getting really sick of this shit, Amy!

955
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,279
No, you know what?

956
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,529
I am done.

957
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:01,670
I'm fucking done helping you out.

958
01:03:01,671 --> 01:03:04,588
You can fucking die for all I care!

959
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

960
01:03:39,867 --> 01:03:44,867
I am so fucking sorry.

961
01:03:44,957 --> 01:03:45,957
Amy...

962
01:03:51,485 --> 01:03:54,503
I'm selfish, and I'm small.

963
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:59,546
And I should just have left you

964
01:03:59,547 --> 01:04:02,300
and been happy, but...

965
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:07,393
I felt so empty.

966
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:13,051
I thought,

967
01:04:13,052 --> 01:04:16,850
I thought I needed more, and

968
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,597
bigger, and better, and...

969
01:04:24,326 --> 01:04:26,559
Fucking idiot.

970
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,330
But I just wanted

971
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:33,719
I wanted a big, crazy life.

972
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,720
I wanted...

973
01:04:35,888 --> 01:04:36,888
I...

974
01:04:38,111 --> 01:04:40,666
I am so fucking sorry.

975
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:45,667
Amy, I am so fucking sorry.

976
01:04:46,306 --> 01:04:49,556
I thought that,

977
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:55,183
I thought that if I was gone,

978
01:04:56,038 --> 01:04:58,266
that you would find somebody better,

979
01:04:58,267 --> 01:05:00,743
that you would find somebody
who could just be happy.

980
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:03,551
Please.

981
01:05:04,765 --> 01:05:05,765
Please,

982
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,563
just fucking talk to me.

983
01:05:11,256 --> 01:05:13,673
Amy, just fucking talk to me.

984
01:05:15,525 --> 01:05:16,525
Amy.

985
01:05:17,711 --> 01:05:19,772
I need to hear your voice.

986
01:05:19,773 --> 01:05:20,773
Amy.

987
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:22,570
Amy.

988
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:48,590
Amy...

989
01:06:00,654 --> 01:06:01,654
Is this,

990
01:06:03,664 --> 01:06:04,664
is this Amy?

991
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,320
Amy,

992
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:18,677
do you hate me?

993
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:29,567
What do you want me to do?

994
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:38,902
What do you want me to do, Amy?

995
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:44,830
No, no...

996
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:50,466
No.

997
01:06:52,191 --> 01:06:53,191
Jay!

998
01:06:58,584 --> 01:06:59,417
No-
