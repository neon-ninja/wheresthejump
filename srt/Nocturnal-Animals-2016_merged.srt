00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,292
By the way, dear, that your cleavage

3
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:15,667
I ought to put my dick
greater than that guy has!

4
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:19,334
And as I recall,
told me when he came

5
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:22,834
That was sparse
such as coconut water! Honey, this is the reason for termination!

6
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,501
It is so rare.
I see that now, and we meet with less!

7
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:31,834
This is too...

8
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,959
Mrs. Morrow,
a package arrived for you.

9
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,959
Thank you.
I found him lying in the mailbox this morning.

10
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:42,792
Can I know who you would like
on duty this weekend?

11
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:45,959
Why not give everyone a free weekend?

12
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,959
Are you sure? -Yes.
Maybe we go to the beach house,

13
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,417
Otherwise it would be nice to spend a weekend alone
.

14
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:54,667
I will inform everyone.
-Thank you.

15
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:00,000
Hell.

16
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:04,083
Christopher? -Yes? -Sorry.
Can you help me open this?

17
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,042
I cut myself on paper.
Course. Give it to me. -Thank you.

18
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:09,751
It's only a paper cut.

19
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,751
There are messages.
-It's fine. You can read it.

EDWARD Sheffield

21
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,292
Dear Susan, I wrote a novel
which will be released in the spring.

22
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:25,083
It's different from what I
wrote when we were together.

23
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:28,959
Set.

24
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,751
In the end, you left me with inspiration
I had to write from the heart.

25
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:35,417
I wanted to read it first.
So I send you a copy.

26
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:39,459
I'll be in LA until the middle of the business and it would be nice to see
and after so much time.

27
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:42,083
My mobile number and email address
below. Edward.

28
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,250
Thank you.

29
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,626
Good morning.
-Good morning.

30
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:03,292
What is it?
-Tropisms To me by Edward sent.

31
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,375
Wrote a novel.

32
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:07,250
What Edward?

33
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,792
Edward, my first husband. Remember him?

34
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,709
I did not know that he can write.

35
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:15,709
Ume. He wrote a novel when we
you and I connect, just can not remember.

36
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,876
Have you talked to in 20 years?
Nineteen.

37
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:24,042
Yes. I tried to call him several times before
years

38
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:25,751
But we hung up.

39
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:28,709
I think teaching English in
a preparatory school in Dallas.

40
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:30,751
It's sad. She did not remarry.

41
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,334
Where were you last night?
You did not come to the site.

42
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:41,501
I'm sorry, really. When I left the office
I was late for dinner...

43
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:45,626
It would have taken away 15 minutes.
15 minutes would mean a lot to me.

44
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,834
It does not matter.

45
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:51,918
You did not come to bed last night.

46
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,709
I did not want to wake you.

47
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,792
Yes.

48
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,667
Well, I have not slept.

49
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,834
I was too nervous about the opening.

50
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:05,125
By the way, it went well. Obviously.

51
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:07,584
Good.
-Yes.

52
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,125
Listen. Why do not we go
to the beach?

53
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:17,083
We can go tonight and come back on Monday.

54
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,709
Perhaps
to spend some time, just the two of us?

55
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:29,459
Why do you wear this blazer on Saturday?

56
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:31,918
Because I have to go back to the office

57
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,501
Then I have to go to the airport,
but have to go back to New York.

58
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:39,751
You just come from New York.
-I know. Do I have to go back

59
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:43,334
If you want to complete the job.
I do not want to have to sell something else.

60
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,876
Shit.
-It's fine.

61
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:51,000
The funny thing is...

62
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:54,000
I no longer care about art.

63
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:59,751
It's not like you.
-I know. But that is the truth.

64
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:02,542
I care.

65
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,667
Irritates me.

66
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:07,334
I know this irritates.

67
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,751
Do not worry.
Can fill the walls with some new artists from LA

68
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:14,250
And people will think we are
step ahead of time instead of going broke.

69
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,792
You will not have to blush.

70
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,834
Are things any better?
He's got a problem with the business now.

71
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:37,083
Carlos told me.

72
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,959
I'm surprised.
I thought that hiding pretty good.

73
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,000
Hutton would be very upset
to discover that someone knows.

74
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:45,417
I do not like to lose.

75
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:47,292
Are you sleeping?

76
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,834
Did you call my psycho pharmacology?

77
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,584
Did you call him?
You should mail a genius.

78
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:55,584
I'm worried about you.
Seriously.

79
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:58,250
Look at me for a moment.
Look at me.

80
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,209
You scared me when we talked last time
.

81
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:06,542
I'm fine.
I'm all right. I'm...

82
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,542
I can not believe I
I told you everything.

83
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:13,459
I'm embarrassed about it.

84
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,459
What right do I not be happy?

85
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:19,834
I have everything.
I feel happy that I am not ungrateful.

86
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:22,292
Same right as the others, Suzanne.

87
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:24,667
Same right as other
because everything is relative.

88
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:32,042
You are incredibly hard on herself.

89
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,792
How do you do it?

90
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:39,250
You mean Carlos?
I do not mind it.

91
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,083
It's not so bad to have a gay man.

92
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:47,501
We are best friends.

93
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:51,292
We love to all beings.
I'm sure that I'm the only woman in his life.

94
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:54,042
And it lasts longer than lust, is not it?

95
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:56,626
Lasts forever.

96
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,834
Hutton and I do not have to.

97
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:00,584
Have you ever had?

98
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,751
I think we want different things.
Or I want different things.

99
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,834
Do you still love him?

100
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:14,584
Called me. Sorry.

101
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:17,125
Mira to catch a plane.
I have to say goodbye.

102
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,375
I hope you enter into this business.

103
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,209
Really.
I know it's necessary.

104
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:29,792
Us necessary.
-Not.

105
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,667
You need that.

106
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:37,626
Hi.
-Hi.

107
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:49,292
So I said,
"My mother always said

108
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:52,709
if you rub your goldfish
spray cooking" Pam "

109
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,542
A month before the baby is born
do not need a rejuvenation of the vagina! "

110
00:08:58,209 --> 00:08:59,959
I have to get a little spray.

111
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,959
And she will get a nomination this year.

112
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,209
Nomination?
'S Going to win.

113
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,417
Let's talk about your opening.

114
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,876
my favorite subject.
and not mine.

115
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:17,834
opening was spectacular last night.

116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,709
Really?
is that what you think?

117
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:21,584
you're not? No.
.

118
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,751
thought
item that is incredibly strong.

119
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:27,959
So perfect with all this garbage
-culture in which we live.

120
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:33,375
Are the garbage. garbage
. Totally rubbish.

121
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:37,125
Honey, you're very successful.

122
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:41,334
None of us really do not
loves what he does.

123
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:44,125
Why are you dealing with it?
Because we are urged.

124
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,375
Maybe a little insecure.

125
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:52,000
Avila things when we are young

126
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,000
Because we think that means something.

127
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:57,918
A then discover that you do not mean.

128
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:04,000
Susan, enjoy
absurdity of our world.

129
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,292
Much less painful.

130
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:14,042
Believe me, our world is
a lot less painful than the real world.

Nocturnal
Edward Sheffield

132
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,083
FOR SUSAN

133
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:07,375
Why do we have to go this
old miracle in Mara?

134
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,709
Because it is fully restored.
This is a classic.

135
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:13,042
There's a horrible sound system.

136
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,000
You'll have to tolerate it.

137
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,000
You've got two pairs of boots, India?

138
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,042
Do we have that we stop tonight?
I prefer to get there?

139
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:22,501
Okay, ask your mother.
She's the boss.

140
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,626
I turned on the alarm.

141
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:47,083
India hanging on that thing for hours.

142
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,918
I thought you wanted to drive all night?

143
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:57,042
I wanted. But what to do, sing
songs that are sung around the campfire?

144
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:06,209
How much?
-I do not know.

145
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:11,250
Approximately three, three and a half hours.

146
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,959
Tara will realize your wish.
Network has just disappeared.

147
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,042
God. Can you believe that there is no network
here? How is it possible?

148
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:21,626
Two things I love about the most
western Texas:

149
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,876
No phones and no people.

150
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,709
Give me a break.

151
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:06,042
The real jerks.
Are we lost them?

152
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:10,834
India, do not do it! What?
What did she do? He showed them the finger.

153
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,584
Mama, I'm afraid.
-Toni. Speed up.

154
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:20,250
It's all right. -Shit!
-Not. I do not like this.

155
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,584
Pick it up, Toni.

156
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,667
Shit!
-Everything is fine.

157
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,083
Just let them go.
Let them pass.

158
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,250
India, do not look at them.

159
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:36,542
But they...
Do not give them an excuse.

160
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:41,209
Why are you laughing?

161
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:43,834
I do not know, honey.
Everything is fine.

162
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:52,918
Crazy!

163
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,959
God.
-Oh my God.

164
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,792
Shit!

165
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:11,042
You jerk, stop!
Stop! God, Toni.

166
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,751
India, did it work phone?

167
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:23,042
No, but I wrote them
registration number.

168
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:32,459
Yes.

169
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:37,459
Yes.

170
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,167
Oh, no.

171
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:44,834
Stop, stop fucking!
-Dad!

172
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,959
Asshole, stop!

173
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:51,375
Yes.
-What do you want?

174
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,250
Beware!

175
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:56,042
Stop!

176
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,125
Shit!

177
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,959
Do not mess!

178
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,542
Do not worry, honey. It's fine.

179
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:38,792
You probably have a gun.
Please, Toni. Go.

180
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:41,042
I can not move.
Blocked the car.

181
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,751
What is he doing?

182
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:56,918
It's okay.

183
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,584
Do not get out of the car.
I'm not going to get out of the car, honey.

184
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,792
Good evening.
-Good evening.

185
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:13,292
You know you need to stop when it comes to
the accident, right? -I know.

186
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:15,167
Why do not we?

187
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,501
It's not going to work.

188
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,834
There's no signal here.

189
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,626
Do not leave the scene of an accident.
This is a crime.

190
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,626
After the way you drive?

191
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:31,584
I'm sorry, what did you say?
Just that you were driving crazy.

192
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,751
Turk!

193
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,083
Do not approach higher.
It's okay, honey.

194
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,125
It's okay. You know what?
I pray you return to the car. Ma'am.

195
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,584
Leave us alone. -Calm down.
I need to report an accident, that's all.

196
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,417
Relax. Ma'am, ma'am.

197
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:50,709
It's just a flashlight, honey.
Only a flashlight. It's fine.

198
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:55,083
God. -OK.
Let's exchange information.

199
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,792
Information? -Yes.
Exchange of information. -OK.

200
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:00,417
Open the glove box, honey.
I'm an identical twin

201
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:04,959
Favorite color is delicate pink,
I love long walks and kittens.

202
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:21,834
You must be... You know what,
we should call the police.

203
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:26,250
Yes. Really?
-Yes. It's a great idea.

204
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,209
You were to blame, right?
-Re? What?

205
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:30,375
It does not matter who was at fault, Toni.

206
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:33,542
Ray, the guy dropped the rubber.
-You bet.

207
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:36,751
What a surprise.
-What did he say? What?

208
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,501
Do not fall for that, Dad.

209
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,042
He said we dropped the tire.
-What did he say?

210
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,417
Do not believe him,
we do not let out of tires.

211
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:51,584
What? What? -Yes. Left tires you
dropped. You bet. Totally.

212
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:54,375
You must have it drilled
when you graveling us the way.

213
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:57,501
Give me a break. We have not you pushed me
the way! You are us!

214
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:01,834
That's a lie. You think I'm a liar?
-It's fine. It's fine.

215
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,000
She's just a child.
Do you think I'm a liar?

216
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,876
No, do not think that, man.
She's just a child.

217
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,209
You have discharged rubber...

218
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,501
Go and drive.

219
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:17,209
Start the car and drive.
Please, drive. Just drive.

220
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,959
Ride on it, asshole.
No one will stop you. Ride.

221
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:23,626
Go. Fuck off, you idiot.

222
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:27,959
Shit! Damn it!
God! God!

223
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:32,334
It's okay, do not worry.
It's not right, we are in the middle of nowhere.

224
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,250
What do we do, Tony?
What we do?

225
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:37,542
What do we do, Tony?

226
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,250
You know what?

227
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:44,334
Replace her instead of you, is not it, guys? -Of course.

228
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:49,459
Really? Yes, just to show that we will replace the
good for you.

229
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:51,292
You will not have your finger to move.

230
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:54,417
Then we'll go to the police
together. Right? You and me.

231
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,042
To report your car accident.
-OK. -Thank you.

232
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,834
Can?
-Yes. -Thank you.

233
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:03,417
Do you have a tool, sir?
There is no need. Our will. Come on.

234
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:22,918
Do you have a spare tire, mate?

235
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:27,209
We can not change a tire without a spare.

236
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:32,751
Will you give me the keys to the trunk?
-Not. What do you think you are?

237
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:35,626
Open up the trunk.

238
00:20:36,918 --> 00:20:38,584
I will.

239
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:40,751
It's okay, I'll do it.
OK.

There below.

242
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,501
There are many things inside.

243
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:59,042
I apologize.
-Bring The woman out of the car.

244
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:01,125
Come on, get them.

245
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:07,125
Come on, man! We need to raise
auto crane, so bring them up.

246
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:14,501
Comrade! We will have to raise
your wife, child and car?

247
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,417
Good.
-Bring The woman out of the car.

248
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:20,250
It's okay, honey. Step out.
I need to repair the car. -Not.

249
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:23,959
Relax. Replace the tire.
-OK dear.

250
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,375

251
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:35,626
Come here. Have you seen what you've done

252
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,375
What are you?

253
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:40,375
What are you?
-One Must think you're a guy.

254
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:43,959
When?
-You are serious? Your bitch. Who else?

255
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:47,959
No, do you think you're something special.
You can hit the borrowed car. -Not.

256
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,209
I want to leave the scene of an accident.
-Playing A wacky game...

257
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,792
God. God.

258
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:12,042

You fucking bitch.
Arrogant rich bitch. I'll teach you a lesson.

262
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:31,000
It's okay.

263
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:38,501
What is it? What are you looking at? Dude.

264
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:41,584
How do you mean?
What were you trying to do on the road?

265
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:44,834
What?
I... What are you?

266
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,292
Listen.

267
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:49,292
We... We...

268
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:53,417
We're just trying to get
where we were going.

269
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:55,125
Where is it?

270
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,209
I said, wherever you go.
-Mara.

271
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,792

273
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:07,626
Leave me alone! Fuck you, baby.
It's not what I meant. She's just a child.

274
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:10,417
Dad will tell me,
why would not you? -Let me!

275
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:14,250
Why do you ask? We're the good guys.
Do not touch anything my daughter!

276
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,584
We just want to know where you're going.

277
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,709
You want to play? Do you want to play?

278
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:21,876
Building a house.
Really? That is all?

279
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:26,876
Look at your father. He thinks he's
much better than me. What do you think?

280
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:30,751
Have better. I mean, seriously.
Look at him. -Let her go!

He's a wimp.

00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:01,584
Are you okay?
Do you need a handkerchief?

289
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:05,751
Damn! It looks bad.
Maybe you need...

00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:07,584
Honey, do you have a tampon?

291
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:10,250
Your nose looks terrible.

00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:24,542
How much down the road we will get a network?

296
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:28,459
Why would you want to drive down the road?
If you could once again escape the scene of the accident?

297
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,209
Leave him alone!

298
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:38,584

For the 4 in the morning.

-31, Please.

338
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:12,501
It's not a normal floor.
-Our Common room was not free.

339
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:15,209
You should have seen what I did
scene in the lobby.

340
00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:20,459
I hope you got some sleep on the plane.

341
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:24,334
I'm worried about you, though
do not care, but I care.

342
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,667
You must be exhausted.

343
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:29,292
I hate that flight. It's really...
-31, ma'am.

344
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:36,042
I arrived on my floor. I have to go. I'll call you later. Right? Suzanne?

345
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,459
Suzanne? Can you hear me?

346
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,792
Yes.

347
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,584
I heard this.

348
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,667
Get some sleep.

349
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:20,250
You're going to drive.

350
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,501
Is this the way out?
For what exit?

351
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:35,334
For Bailey?
-Go on.

352
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,834
Set speed up.

353
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:58,417
What can you do?
-Here. Turn down here.

354
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,792
Fuck you.
I'm not going down that path!

355
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:05,876
Listen, sir.
Do you want to see your wife and child?

356
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,918
Then turn left on the road.

357
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,250
You will cry now?

358
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:48,667
But we've just passed my car!
It's not your car, man. Go on.

359
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:51,542
There's no need to worry
for his wife and child.

360
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:58,250
As I said there is no need to worry
for them. -What do you mean?

361
00:29:58,417 --> 00:30:01,501
What does it mean? -Calm down.
No one has so far not killed.

362
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:04,167
Just to think.
At least not that I know of.

363
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:06,334
Killed! Why are you talking about killing?

364
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:08,709
I said that nobody ever killed.

365
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,125
If you had listened to me,
to hear what I was saying.

366
00:30:38,584 --> 00:30:43,334
So, it looks like
we ran out of time. They're not here.

367
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,792
I wonder if I'm wrong.

368
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,959
It's time to get out now.
OK?

369
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:51,959
Get out!
-What are you doing?

370
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:57,375
Get killed if you're not careful.
Stop.

371
00:30:57,626 --> 00:30:59,334
Stop!

372
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,667
No! Stop! Stop!

373
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,959
No! Not!

374
00:31:37,918 --> 00:31:39,626
Shit!

375
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:58,083
Why did you leave here?

376
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:03,959
Lord?

377
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:07,292
Your wife called.

378
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:11,375
Get in the car!

379
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:16,000
Lord! Your wife!

380
00:32:17,584 --> 00:32:19,918
Lord!

381
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:22,375
Shit.

382
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:40,751
Can I use your phone?

383
00:34:57,584 --> 00:35:01,000
Mr. Hastings, no
nearby town named "Bailey".

384
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:05,167
That's what I was afraid of.
-Motel Is across the street.

385
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:09,042
Do you have money?
I have a credit card.

386
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,542
It's still early, G. Hastings.

387
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:16,292
We'll call if we had something.
-OK. Thank you.

388
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:24,751
Hello?
-Here Lieutenant Graves.

389
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,334
They found your car in the dry streamlined at
topping.

390
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:30,250
What's with my wife and daughter?

391
00:36:30,584 --> 00:36:33,626
I still have no news.
They were in the car.

392
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,918
We leave this case
lieutenant Andes.

393
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:39,834
He wants to know if you can come
after you for a few minutes?

394
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:41,667
Yes, I'm ready now.

395
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:56,834
Good morning.
I'm glad you came.

396
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:59,834
I'm Bobby Andes.
I'm conducting an investigation here.

397
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:03,667
You found my car?
-They Found him in the streamed.

398
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,876
You know what?
If you go back to the house where we picked you up

399
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:13,125
Can I go back to the same
through there? I can try.

400
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:17,667
Well, then, try.
Here we go.

401
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:26,667
I understand
these guys were not armed.

402
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:29,250
Yes.

403
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:33,459
Good.

404
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:36,959
Do I understand this.
Guy named Lu

405
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:40,709
Brought you into the bushes, leaving
you there? I made them me drive.

406
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:42,626
He made you to drive.

407
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:46,751
I went to see when you're
them to come back. -Yes.

408
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:50,584
What kind of car was it?
I think it was mine.

409
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:53,375
Do?
What do you mean?

410
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:56,584
Based on his appearance, sound.
He sounded like my car.

411
00:37:56,751 --> 00:37:58,918
Are you able to see them in the dark?

412
00:38:01,709 --> 00:38:04,334
Not good.
Are they something?

413
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:08,167
They said:
"Sir, your wife asks you."

414
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:11,459
You did not go with them?

415
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:13,209
Why did not you go with them?

416
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:18,918
I do not know why I did not go.

417
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:30,125
Good.

418
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,667
Can you take it from here?

419
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:37,042
I came highway.
I walked for a long time.

420
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:39,417
No one has stopped.

421
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:44,375
Sergeant, slow
go backwards to the edge.

422
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,501
Start the rotation.

423
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:03,292
Stop the car.
Stop the car!

424
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:06,626
I slipped through that fence
barbed wire. Right there,

425
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:08,501
Near the limelight.
I remember that.

426
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:11,501
Let's go out to walk.
You said you were walking there, is not it?

427
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:21,375
I came right here because I
walked over there along the streamed.

428
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:24,626
This is part of the estate of the old Valdez.
There's an old station for cattle

429
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:27,417
Down that road not far from where
burn their trash.

430
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:29,959
This road leads there.

431
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,250
Is she okay?

432
00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:41,083
Mama? Is that you?
Is everything OK?

433
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,751
Yes, everything is fine.
I just wanted to hear your voice.

434
00:40:44,918 --> 00:40:46,626
I miss you.

435
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:51,501
You woke me. I'm still in bed. Sunday morning, Mom.

436
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:57,542
Can I call you back? -Yes. Invite
me later. Go back to bed, honey.

437
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,834
You sound strange.
Are you OK?

438
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:04,792
I'm fine.

439
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:08,417
I'm fine.
Back to bed.

440
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:15,209
I love you. -Me too.
I'll call you later. -Okay.

441
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:42,417
Edward? Edward?

442
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,751
Hello.
-Susanna. Hello. God.

443
00:41:45,751 --> 00:41:48,250
How are you?
It's nice to see a familiar face.

444
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:50,125
I'm glad to see you.

445
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:53,959
You look beautiful. As always.

446
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:56,834
What are you doing in New York?

447
00:41:57,417 --> 00:42:01,167
I'm here to talk to
scholarship to Columbia.

448
00:42:01,459 --> 00:42:03,959
Colombia? I thought you
at the University of Texas

449
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:08,250
Where you become a great writer.
A big writer? I do not know.

450
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,542
I do not think so. That's right.

451
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:14,459
Are not you at Yale, where
become a great artist?

452
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:17,417
I graduated from Yale, Columbia
or the finishing master.

453
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:20,876
Yes, the history of art.
-Great.

454
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:24,250
Do you know anyone else in New York?

455
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:29,250
Just you. -Just me?
-Okay. Would you like for dinner?

456
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:32,209
Course.
-Okay.

457
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:35,667
Great. Let me...

458
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:39,167
Just to leave the bags in the apartment.
Will I bring them?

459
00:42:39,209 --> 00:42:41,834
Yes, great. Thank you.
I miss Texas gentleman.

460
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,501
You know, we do not have such a snowstorm in Texas.
No, you do not have.

461
00:42:59,584 --> 00:43:03,167
You know, you were my first crush
in Hastings.

462
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:07,125
The only reason I spent so much time
with your brother

463
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:10,250
Was to be close.
And you were his first crush.

464
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:12,167
What?
-Yes.

465
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:14,459
I had no idea that Cooper is gay.

466
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:19,125
I do not think he did not know,
but he was obsessed with you.

467
00:43:21,209 --> 00:43:22,918
Yes.

468
00:43:22,918 --> 00:43:24,834
If I had not noticed that so much looking at me,

469
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:27,125
I thought I would not sleep with him.

470
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:33,375
I feel terrible that he did not call
years.

471
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:37,209
I have a feeling that I was a bad friend.
I hope that it is not affected.

472
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:42,876
You're good. Do you know that? Really.
Most guys would panic when they find out

473
00:43:42,918 --> 00:43:46,918
That their best friend
in love with them. Very nice of you.

474
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,709
You need to call him.

475
00:43:50,876 --> 00:43:55,876
I would love to. My parents have it
to speak up. We no longer speak.

476
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:59,292
Why? -Why?
Are you serious?

477
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:01,459
You know my parents.

478
00:44:01,626 --> 00:44:04,792
The religious, conservative,
sexist, racist...

479
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:09,334
Republicans, materialistic, narcissistic
. Racists.

480
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:13,250
Can I continue... Yes
I just want to know what you really think, Suzanne.

481
00:44:13,459 --> 00:44:15,125
It's true, I know.

482
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:17,918
They look at us as his reflection.

483
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:20,959
Why can not I accept
Cooper as it is.

484
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,584
I'm not sure how I'm going to go.

485
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,167
Are not you a little hard on them?

486
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:28,542
Yes.

487
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:33,417
They have outdated ideas about how to
to live my life, especially the mother.

488
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,292
I understand.
I always liked your mother.

489
00:44:37,459 --> 00:44:39,209
Really?
-Yes.

490
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:41,834
Super acted according
me when my dad died.

491
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:46,083
Both have the same kind of sadness in his eyes.

492
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:50,542
What?
You and your mother.

493
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:54,209
It's weird to say, Edward.

494
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:57,083
I'm sorry. I did not mean to offend you.
I was just...

495
00:44:57,584 --> 00:45:00,334
I always looked sad.

496
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:04,584
There are sad eyes. This opinion
I have since childhood.

497
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:07,876
You have the same eyes.

498
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:10,834
One su...

499
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,584
Divine.

500
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:24,876
Just do not say I'm like my mother.
I do not want to be like her.

501
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:33,250
I've always envied your family.
I felt like an intruder in a large school.

502
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:38,375
You feel the same way?
I thought that the only way I feel. -You? -Yes.

503
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:41,792
I have always been preoccupied with time
to be perfect. I... do not you feel so?

504
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:45,792
Yes. That this administration
seems so perfect.

505
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:54,167
You'll be a great novelist
because you created a fictional character in his head.

506
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:58,709
Yes. -Yes.
-Not. -Yes. -Not.

507
00:45:59,334 --> 00:46:01,459
I do not believe it.

508
00:46:03,709 --> 00:46:06,167
Why have you given up on
addition to becoming an artist?

509
00:46:09,626 --> 00:46:12,626
Because I'm too cynical
to be an artist.

510
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,083
To be very good, you need to you come from

511
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,709
Someplace within
that I do not think I have.

512
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:21,000
You underestimate yourself.

513
00:46:23,167 --> 00:46:24,918
Do you know that?

514
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:33,751
Edward...

515
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:39,626
Will you come home with me?

516
00:46:41,417 --> 00:46:43,167
It's a little intrusive.

517
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:45,042
Yes.

518
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:47,709
I would not expect from
Texas debutantes.

519
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:50,167
You know that all the debutantes sluts.

520
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,584
You were my first crush.

521
00:46:57,584 --> 00:46:59,292
I know.

522
00:47:25,834 --> 00:47:28,292
We have a report from Ozone.

523
00:47:28,459 --> 00:47:32,083
Someone else is bullied at
highway last night like you.

524
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:40,959
If it is not a problem, I could come
us your fingerprints.

525
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,959
More? He's got a lot of prints
the trunk of your car.

526
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:46,501
It might help
identify them.

527
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:52,459
There's something else.

528
00:47:52,709 --> 00:47:56,918
Do?
We got the cause of death.

529
00:48:00,626 --> 00:48:04,584
Your wife has fractured skull.

530
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:07,834
Probably was hit with a hammer,
or a baseball bat.

531
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:10,667
Probably once or twice, but...

532
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:15,709
Your daughter has gone through much worse.

533
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:18,167
Stifled it.

534
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,042
Also  her arm is broken.

535
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:28,292
I both were raped.

536
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:36,834
Turns out you were right
and barracks. -How?

537
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:40,375
These guys have taken your family
there as you thought.

538
00:48:42,209 --> 00:48:46,501
How do you know? -We Found your fingerprints
women on STUBICA beds.

539
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:50,501
Whose is this shack?
He's clean.

540
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:53,083
Tip do not even live here.
He's in El Paso.

541
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:55,751
The hut was broken into.
Some lived in it.

542
00:48:55,918 --> 00:48:59,542
The prints are all over the barracks.
We'll have to compare them with the fingerprints of the owner,

543
00:48:59,626 --> 00:49:01,918
To see if they can be sorted out.
-Okay.

544
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:05,167
But lay hope.
The owner was not there since last fall, so...

545
00:49:06,584 --> 00:49:08,792
Looks promising.

546
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,834
Promised...

547
00:49:15,501 --> 00:49:17,501
Promising?

548
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:31,375
Why did you not tell it?

549
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:33,417
Will leave New York

550
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:37,751
I'll move to Austin to go to class
cursed University of Texas?

551
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:40,501
Why are you doing this?

552
00:49:40,918 --> 00:49:44,209
I mean, where is this going?
How to think where this is going?

553
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:46,334
I will marry Edward.
That's where it goes.

554
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:49,083
This is a stupid conversation.

555
00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:53,167
You're too young to be getting married.
Really?

556
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:56,751
Mama, last year you tried to convince me
I have to marry Basa.

557
00:49:56,918 --> 00:49:59,209
This was different.

558
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:01,125
Bass is like you.

559
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:03,167
God, did you just say that?

560
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,375
Did you really say that?
That came out of your mouth? It's...

561
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:11,000
Why do you always think the worst of me?

562
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:15,751
I did not mean it.

563
00:50:15,918 --> 00:50:17,918
I thought...

564
00:50:18,626 --> 00:50:21,250
If you were a very determined...

565
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:24,375
A Edward besides being cute,
it is too bad for you.

566
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:29,292
I do not think Edward described as poor.
I would use the word sensitive,

567
00:50:29,501 --> 00:50:33,083
What is the word I used the
to describe anyone from this family,

568
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:36,083
Except maybe Cooper.
No Cooper pulls into this.

569
00:50:36,584 --> 00:50:38,250
I'm sorry.

570
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,334
Come on, Susan.

571
00:50:41,876 --> 00:50:45,959
I know you think that we do not care about
to the same things, but you're wrong.

572
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,667
For several years, all of these "bourgeois"
things that you like to call them

573
00:50:49,667 --> 00:50:51,375
You will be very important.

574
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:54,417
Edward will not be able to provide them to you.

575
00:50:55,459 --> 00:50:57,250
He has no money.

576
00:50:59,501 --> 00:51:02,167
Not motivated. It is not ambitious.

577
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:07,042
I can promise you, if you marry
Edward is not your father's will not provide.

578
00:51:07,209 --> 00:51:12,250
No, you're right, he is not motivated
the way you want it to be,

579
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:14,125
Or is strong.

580
00:51:14,292 --> 00:51:18,209
He's Stronger than me in many ways.
Just...

581
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:20,584
He just has a different kind of power.
That is all.

582
00:51:20,918 --> 00:51:25,125
A different kind of strength?
What kind of power?

583
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:29,667
It has the power to believe in yourself.

584
00:51:29,959 --> 00:51:32,000
Do not believe in me.

585
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:34,626
Suzanne...

586
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:38,626
Set to see him if you must.
Lives with him. I do not care

587
00:51:38,626 --> 00:51:40,709
But do not marry him.

588
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:45,459
I understand what you see in Edward.
I understand. -Not.

589
00:51:45,459 --> 00:51:48,375
No, wait, I get it.
I do not understand.

590
00:51:48,417 --> 00:51:51,292
I see. I do not understand.
He's a romantic.

591
00:51:51,918 --> 00:51:53,918
But it is also very fragile.

592
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:56,125
I saw that when his father died.

593
00:51:58,459 --> 00:52:00,125
Do not...

594
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:02,584
Do not do that.

595
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,292
You'll be sorry.

596
00:52:06,959 --> 00:52:09,542
I'll only hurt Edward in the end.

597
00:52:11,584 --> 00:52:16,250
Things like about it now, you will hate
for several years.

598
00:52:17,626 --> 00:52:20,918
Perhaps do not see that but...

599
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:24,834
You and I are a lot alike
than you think.

600
00:52:26,918 --> 00:52:30,918
Yes.
You're wrong. You and I do not like.

601
00:52:31,876 --> 00:52:33,584
Really?

602
00:52:35,334 --> 00:52:37,501
Wait.

603
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:41,167
All
eventually turn into their mothers.

604
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,334
Dear Edward, I read your book.
Shocking. I am deeply touched.

605
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:56,459
It's wonderful to be written. Let's meet on Tuesday evening
. Tell me if you're still free.

606
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:59,834
I have much to tell you.
Love, Susan.

607
00:53:22,959 --> 00:53:25,542
Do?
-Toni Hastings?

608
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:30,501
Yes. Who is this?
-Robert Andes.

609
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:32,667
I sent you an email.
Did you get it?

610
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:35,375
Yes.
Do you recognize this man?

611
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,334
Yes.
-Shit.

612
00:53:38,876 --> 00:53:40,792
Hell.
Are you sure?

613
00:53:40,959 --> 00:53:43,417
The entire event is confusing me.

614
00:53:43,584 --> 00:53:45,918
The prints of the man they were
all over your car.

615
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:48,334
We found them in the barracks.
His name is Steve Adams.

616
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:52,209
There are records in California, stealing rounds
s acquittal for rape.

617
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:55,792
I betrayed warrant for his arrest.
He is the only clue we have, Toni.

618
00:53:55,834 --> 00:53:58,209
I'm sure that there are no other witnesses.

619
00:53:59,918 --> 00:54:02,292
Sure you do not recognize?

620
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:05,959
Yes.
Holy shit. What's up, man?

621
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:09,959
Do not you want to send this
guys in jail? -Of course I want.

622
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:12,918
The whole event is just...

623
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,959
My mind froze.

624
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:36,792
I know it was him!

625
00:54:36,834 --> 00:54:39,334
That may be, but nobody
it is not just about video here.

626
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:42,584
Listen, I have to be honest with you.
At the moment it does not look good.

627
00:54:42,626 --> 00:54:46,876
Sometimes in these cases no
shift for months, even years.

628
00:54:46,876 --> 00:54:49,375
You have to prepare for it.

629
00:55:30,876 --> 00:55:33,542
Why are you so motivated to write?

630
00:55:33,751 --> 00:55:37,375
I guess in that way
keep things in life.

631
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:43,167
Rescuing
things will eventually die.

632
00:55:44,501 --> 00:55:47,042
If it down

633
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:49,626
Then it will last forever.

634
00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:21,292
Good afternoon. -Hello.
-I apologize for being late.

635
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:24,125
Wry traffic on the interstate
way. -Does not matter.

636
00:56:24,709 --> 00:56:27,584
You look different.
I do not have a beard.

637
00:56:29,209 --> 00:56:30,918
You look different.

638
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:34,000
Yes.

639
00:56:34,417 --> 00:56:38,334
I'll tell you what we have.
We have attempted robbery supermarkets

640
00:56:38,334 --> 00:56:42,375
At the mall last night just before closing
. We caught one.

641
00:56:42,417 --> 00:56:45,167
One was killed and one was wiped out.

642
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:47,751
What do you want me to do?

643
00:56:48,209 --> 00:56:51,167
See if you can identify
guy we caught.

644
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:57,334
You look at the dead, although I
it's not necessary. We know who he is.

645
00:56:57,667 --> 00:57:00,876
When?
-Stiv Adams.

646
00:57:02,209 --> 00:57:06,459
The one you called "Turk" and whose
I sent you a picture on the mail last year.

647
00:57:11,626 --> 00:57:13,334
Get in.

648
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:21,334
Are you afraid to look
of this type in the eye? To see?

649
00:57:21,584 --> 00:57:23,292
Yes.

650
00:57:23,459 --> 00:57:26,083
That's good. I think this will help you to sing
.

651
00:57:39,584 --> 00:57:44,000
That's him. Type the left.
First on the left. That's him.

652
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:49,042
No, no. Hold on, son.

653
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,250
You're not that lucky.
Come here.

654
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:57,542
This guy?
-Yes. I understand.

655
00:57:57,709 --> 00:58:00,584
I do not understand.
Lu.

656
00:58:00,876 --> 00:58:02,542
Lu. Hey you.

657
00:58:03,292 --> 00:58:05,709
Name is Lu?
You know my name. I told you.

658
00:58:05,709 --> 00:58:07,834
Really?
About what is it?

659
00:58:09,959 --> 00:58:13,876
I want you to tell me
have you ever seen this man.

660
00:58:14,042 --> 00:58:16,501
Carefully consider.
Have you ever seen him?

661
00:58:18,876 --> 00:58:20,584
Yes. I do not know him.

662
00:58:20,709 --> 00:58:24,417
Who is he? Why do not you try
say, Tony? Tell him who he is.

663
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,709
Last year, this one Lu and his comrades
pushed us out of the way

664
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:31,042
Interstate on the way. Then the two of them
forcibly entered my car

665
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:34,292
With my wife and daughter and then
is this man... Why this man? Lu?

666
00:58:34,334 --> 00:58:36,584
Yes. Lu made me
to drive his car

667
00:58:36,626 --> 00:58:39,209
He took me to the middle of the desert
and left me there.

668
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:45,125
Later, my wife and daughter
found dead near the same city.

669
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,334
It's not right.

670
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:02,792
What have you to say about
wife and daughter of this man?

671
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:06,125
I do not know anything about it.
I never saw him.

672
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:11,417
What are you going to tell me about Ray and Turks?
-About whom? -About whom?

673
00:59:12,584 --> 00:59:14,292
What are you, an owl?

674
00:59:14,542 --> 00:59:16,250
Are you an owl, Lu?

675
00:59:16,459 --> 00:59:19,542
I have never heard of them.
You've never heard of them?

676
00:59:19,709 --> 00:59:21,501
No, sir.

677
00:59:33,626 --> 00:59:35,334
Good.

678
00:59:38,334 --> 00:59:40,125
Officer.

679
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:41,959
Lock him.

680
00:59:45,584 --> 00:59:48,292
Are you sure this is the man?
Course. Yes.

681
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,375
I could have sworn in court
under penalty of perjury?

682
00:59:51,626 --> 00:59:53,334
Yes.

683
00:59:58,209 --> 01:00:00,042
Good.

684
01:00:01,292 --> 01:00:02,959
Well...

685
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,083
I have Lu.

686
01:00:05,334 --> 01:00:08,626
Accuse him of murder.
-You Have enough evidence?

687
01:00:08,626 --> 01:00:11,542
Course. We've got you,
his fingerprints on the car and barracks.

688
01:00:11,542 --> 01:00:13,792
He returned to the barracks after
you left me?

689
01:00:13,792 --> 01:00:18,042
Yes, so it seems. Probably
returned to tell them where you are,

690
01:00:18,209 --> 01:00:22,876
So they returned with the bodies.
They wanted to kill you.

691
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:27,626
Understand? Yes. I bet it's your friend Ray
the third robber.

692
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,375
What now?

693
01:00:30,459 --> 01:00:33,209
You'll wait for the trial.

694
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:38,334
I'll find Reja.

695
01:00:44,542 --> 01:00:48,667
Do not forget that you have a meeting
committee at the museum in three.

696
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,250
I'm sorry. What did you say?

697
01:00:55,709 --> 01:00:57,417
Again did not sleep, did not you?

698
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:05,042
You know me.
I do not sleep.

699
01:01:05,918 --> 01:01:08,626
My ex-husband called me
"nocturnal."

700
01:01:08,792 --> 01:01:10,501
Which ex-husband?

701
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,375
I did not know you had an ex-husband.
Since when?

702
01:01:13,626 --> 01:01:16,459
A few years ago, when I was
diploma studies.

703
01:01:17,501 --> 01:01:20,042
It's strange to think of it
a lot lately

704
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:23,250
Recently sent me
book written and it is...

705
01:01:24,626 --> 01:01:30,501
Violent and sad. He called it
"Night Animals" and dedicated it to me.

706
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:34,834
Did you love him?
-Yes. I loved him.

707
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:37,250
He was a writer and...

708
01:01:37,834 --> 01:01:40,375
I did not believe in him.

709
01:01:40,542 --> 01:01:44,167
I panicked and done something terrible to him
. Something unforgivable.

710
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:48,959
Really. -Then You?
-Then It.

711
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:53,083
I left him...
in a brutal manner.

712
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,751
Because the handsome and dashing Hutton.

713
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
What is very convenient...
-I dashing. Yes.

714
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:04,250
Do you sometimes feel that your life
into something you did not intend?

715
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,959
Yes.

716
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:12,751
Yes.

717
01:02:12,959 --> 01:02:16,167
Of course not.
You've only just begun to live your life.

718
01:02:17,751 --> 01:02:20,042
I really have not slept at all, is it?

719
01:02:23,292 --> 01:02:24,959
Yes.

720
01:02:56,959 --> 01:02:58,751
REVENGE

721
01:03:13,918 --> 01:03:15,959
Where did this picture come from?

722
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:19,083
What do you mean where did she come from?
You bought it for us. You remember?

723
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:21,709
As part of the items that were exhibited
8 years ago.

724
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:23,501
It's great, is not it?
-Yes.

725
01:03:24,626 --> 01:03:26,334
What is it?

726
01:03:26,584 --> 01:03:31,626
God is awesome. Applications using
to watch Willow while in the cradle.

727
01:03:31,792 --> 01:03:34,417
Really? Do not trust your nanny?

728
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:36,501
No, I believe, only hate.

729
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:39,834
I love that I'm more involved around Willow
during the day, but...

730
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:42,292
View. Here she is.

731
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:45,834
I sound amazing.
You can hear her breathing.

732
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:48,042
I can not tell her if you want.

733
01:03:50,584 --> 01:03:52,292
I'm sorry.

734
01:03:52,292 --> 01:03:54,000
I'm so sorry. I...

735
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:55,751
Are you okay?
-Yes.

736
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,709
Yes, I just...

737
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,501
I thought I saw someone.

738
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:06,250
You really see anyone.
It was Willow. And she was in the cradle.

739
01:04:06,292 --> 01:04:11,042
Sleeping. Really I
sorry for your phone. Can...

740
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:14,000
No matter. New outputs
next week or sooner. -Thank you.

741
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:16,918
Will we?

742
01:04:17,542 --> 01:04:19,709
All of us are waiting.

743
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:42,584
In any case,
should be let go.

744
01:04:42,584 --> 01:04:45,501
It is no longer the same as it was when we hired
. -I do not agree.

745
01:04:45,501 --> 01:04:48,667
I think we should keep it for now.
-Why? Because it's great.

746
01:04:48,709 --> 01:04:52,083
I love it all. She just needs our support
. I some time.

747
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:54,501
But it does not work.
We have to let go.

748
01:04:54,626 --> 01:04:58,542
There's an excellent candidate who can steal
"Hamer" If we act quickly.

749
01:04:58,542 --> 01:05:02,792
I agree with Linda.
We are engaged is supposed to support her.

750
01:05:02,959 --> 01:05:04,667
New Doctor?

751
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:08,167
No new haircut.

752
01:05:09,834 --> 01:05:13,792
But, Susan, you are initiated on this
last meeting to seek a change.

753
01:05:13,792 --> 01:05:16,876
I know, but now I think
we should keep it.

754
01:05:16,876 --> 01:05:18,626
Sometimes it's...

755
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:26,083
Sometimes it might not be such a good idea
much changed things.

756
01:06:41,792 --> 01:06:43,584
I do not understand.

757
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,209
What are we doing here?
-Shit.

758
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:51,042
Are you all right?

759
01:06:52,459 --> 01:06:56,542
Yes.
I'm all right. For me.

760
01:07:06,667 --> 01:07:08,375
It's Ray Markus.

761
01:07:08,626 --> 01:07:12,125
Characterized as a frequent contributor
Lu Bates and Steve Adams.

762
01:07:12,959 --> 01:07:17,626
Works part-time as an electrician and plumber
, hence smart toilet.

763
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Fits your description
and the guy from the heist.
No prints but that we already knew.
I wonder why no fingerprints.

764
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,751
His hands are probably
were on your wife.

765
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:31,834
His files are clean.

766
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:34,417
In addition to charges of rape
which was rejected.

767
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:38,584
I heard from the bartender from the bar "Line Camp"
Re to live here with the girl Leila,

768
01:07:38,626 --> 01:07:41,918
But it also has another place where
leads the girls that she does not know.

769
01:07:41,918 --> 01:07:44,083
Probably the barracks where
was murdered family

770
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:46,125
Before it became notorious.

771
01:07:47,626 --> 01:07:50,709
Does it feel that this is the right man?
-Yes.

772
01:07:50,876 --> 01:07:52,751
That's him.
-Okay.

773
01:07:53,459 --> 01:07:55,542
Let's talk to him.

774
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,584
Ray.
What the fuck?

775
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:13,542
Who are you?

776
01:08:13,792 --> 01:08:15,501
Get off my property, man!

777
01:08:16,918 --> 01:08:18,626
Shit! I'll call you.

778
01:08:18,918 --> 01:08:20,626
I want to ask you some questions.

779
01:08:20,667 --> 01:08:24,751
Fuck you.
I'm busy now.

780
01:08:25,834 --> 01:08:28,292
What is it?
Just a few questions, that's all.

781
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:30,667
You need to come with us.
-Why?

782
01:08:31,292 --> 01:08:33,959
I did nothing.
I did not say you did.

783
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:37,501
Ask me here. -Not.
You have little to take a ride with us.

784
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:39,751
Come on. Finish what you're doing and go.

785
01:08:39,959 --> 01:08:41,834
Can you turn around?

786
01:08:44,542 --> 01:08:47,542
Believe me, I wish I could, but...

787
01:08:49,918 --> 01:08:51,918
Unbelievable.

788
01:08:58,125 --> 01:09:01,167
OK. Enough.
Come on.

789
01:09:01,167 --> 01:09:02,876
Come on now.

790
01:09:03,417 --> 01:09:06,459
Okay, come on. Get dressed.
Come on.

791
01:09:15,042 --> 01:09:18,125
Interrogate me?
-Yes. We do, right?

792
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:19,876
You have not read the law.

793
01:09:25,751 --> 01:09:28,876
Do you know your rights, Ray.
He needs to read them out.

794
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:32,584
I read you, eh, Tony?

795
01:09:35,334 --> 01:09:37,167
I read these rights.

796
01:09:37,167 --> 01:09:39,542
It's not legal, man.
You need to have a lawyer.

797
01:09:39,834 --> 01:09:43,792
Take it easy, sunshine.
This is just an informational hearing.

798
01:09:44,042 --> 01:09:46,792
That's all. You help me.
I've never accused of anything.

799
01:09:46,959 --> 01:09:50,542
If you want a lawyer, I can take you to the station
i blame you for something.

800
01:09:50,584 --> 01:09:54,000
No kidding. No need for bringing me.
I answer the questions, right?

801
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:56,834
Come on. -I do not know. -Set
Me some questions.

802
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,709
I will answer them.
I do not know anything more about that robbery

803
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:01,959
Than before
I knew before I met you.

804
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,334
You know what, let me ask you another question.
Do you recognize this car?

805
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:07,209
What kind of car?
-This.

806
01:10:07,209 --> 01:10:10,375
It in which to ride.
Why should we be familiar with this car?

807
01:10:10,626 --> 01:10:13,375
They did not know each other?
On anything and does not resemble? In the past?

808
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,709
Why?
I do not remember that they're driving?

809
01:10:15,918 --> 01:10:18,959
I think I know.
-Yes. A driver?

810
01:10:19,042 --> 01:10:23,167
What? This guy? This guy
behind the wheel, my friend Toni.

811
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:25,125
Do you remember it?

812
01:10:26,959 --> 01:10:28,709
I do not see it.

813
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:31,250
One turned.

814
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:33,042
Stop the car, Tony.

815
01:10:37,584 --> 01:10:40,042
Turn around and look at this garbage.

816
01:10:42,876 --> 01:10:45,751
Who is this guy?
Do not remember it?

817
01:10:46,459 --> 01:10:49,417
I can not say that I remember.
-Remember You know him, Toni?

818
01:10:49,459 --> 01:10:51,542
Yes.
-refresh His memory.

819
01:10:51,667 --> 01:10:55,083
Last year the interstate road.
Tell him remember what he did.

820
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,459
You killed my wife and daughter.

821
01:10:57,667 --> 01:10:59,417
It's crazy. I did not kill anybody.

822
01:10:59,417 --> 01:11:01,125
Tell him the whole event.

823
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:04,125
You and your buddies on the interstate
you pushed us out of the way.

824
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:07,918
Tell him who his buddies. - On the Turk.
Do you remember that? Remember monkey

825
01:11:07,959 --> 01:11:11,501
On the interstate road with friends?
Plays a coward with other cars?

826
01:11:11,542 --> 01:11:15,250
You're crazy. It's crazy. -I made You
us to stop and we had discharged the tire.

827
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:19,083
Lu i Turk had been replaced. Then you and
Turk got into the car with my wife and daughter

828
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:22,834
But you forced me to get in your car with Lou
. What was it, Tony?

829
01:11:22,834 --> 01:11:25,375
Lu took me into the bushes and kicked me.

830
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:27,459
Then you went back to my car.

831
01:11:27,709 --> 01:11:30,792
You called me and tried to make me
retract into the trap. You're back

832
01:11:30,834 --> 01:11:34,918
Where I was Lu left.
Because you're back there, Ray?

833
01:11:41,918 --> 01:11:45,167
You're crazy!
Tell him what we found there, Toni.

834
01:11:45,959 --> 01:11:49,292
You tell him. -Do I have to?
Do not you know, Ray?

835
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:56,876
You're crazy. He's crazy.

836
01:11:57,751 --> 01:11:59,876
Which you took back there

837
01:12:00,292 --> 01:12:01,959
And germs.

838
01:12:03,584 --> 01:12:05,292
You're the one.

839
01:12:05,334 --> 01:12:07,042
I know you.

840
01:12:07,042 --> 01:12:08,751
What do you say, Ray?

841
01:12:08,918 --> 01:12:11,375
You're crazy. You're making a big mistake.

842
01:12:12,459 --> 01:12:14,167
I do not think so.

843
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:16,375
I do not think so, Ray.

844
01:12:16,626 --> 01:12:18,792
Stretch out your hand.
You have no rights.

845
01:12:18,959 --> 01:12:23,292
I have no right? Law, law, law
. You and your rights.

846
01:12:23,292 --> 01:12:27,042
Speaking of rights, know
to record the whole conversation.

847
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:30,626
Here.
Understand? OK.

848
01:12:30,667 --> 01:12:32,375
Come on, Toni.

849
01:12:34,959 --> 01:12:36,959
Let's go to a place that you might remember.

850
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:39,876
Can I help myself
so what are you going to tell me about it.

851
01:12:39,959 --> 01:12:41,667
But if you do not remember,

852
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:43,501
Toni remembers.

853
01:12:43,667 --> 01:12:46,459
OK? I'm sorry you lost
family man.

854
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:48,417
Pity.

855
01:12:48,459 --> 01:12:50,584
But I had nothing to do with it.

856
01:13:09,459 --> 01:13:11,334
What is this place?
You know you here.

857
01:13:11,626 --> 01:13:14,083
I swear, I do not know.
You want to get out, Tony?

858
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:17,626
You want to look in there, Ray?
-Why? Come on. Let's look.

859
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:32,250
OK.

860
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,959
OK.

861
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:40,584
I suppose you
them raped her on the bed.

862
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:43,042
No one I never raped her.
Do not be stupid, Ray!

863
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:45,709
We've seen your file.
We know that girl in Lubbock.

864
01:13:45,709 --> 01:13:49,918
The charge was dismissed. I've never raped anybody
. I want to know, Ray.

865
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:54,167
I want to know what they're doing exactly.

866
01:13:55,667 --> 01:13:59,250
You'll have to ask someone else.
I want to know what you were saying.

867
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:05,334
I want to know what my wife told
and what my daughter said.

868
01:14:14,834 --> 01:14:17,042
I want to know how you kill them.

869
01:14:17,417 --> 01:14:19,792
I want to know if
know what happened to them.

870
01:14:20,042 --> 01:14:21,918
I want to know how they felt!

871
01:14:25,501 --> 01:14:27,209
I want to know if you have suffered!

872
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:32,751
Answer me!

873
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:35,834
Answer me!

874
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:40,792
Answer me, you fucking bastard!

875
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:00,501
Is it better?

876
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:03,209
You're going the wrong way or

877
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:07,709
I think you should write
about something else and not of themselves.

878
01:15:10,918 --> 01:15:13,334
But nobody writes about anything else
care of themselves.

879
01:15:13,584 --> 01:15:17,626
My mind began to wander as I read
and it's not good. Is not it?

880
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:20,167
I do not know what to do.
May have something to write about.

881
01:15:20,334 --> 01:15:24,042
Give yourself a little vent. Do something else.
Can you not do that? What?

882
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:27,709
Because I feel that because you do not believe me
. -Edward, I did not say that.

883
01:15:27,876 --> 01:15:31,501
No, you said it, but talking about
to his face, sighs,

884
01:15:31,501 --> 01:15:34,167
Whatever you say, talking about
me to go back to college.

885
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:37,792
I have to go back to college.
I do not see anything wrong with that.

886
01:15:37,792 --> 01:15:42,042
I'm just realistic.
You will work in a bookstore i'll write a novel

887
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:45,125
As if it
what you want from your life?

888
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:50,125
It's very romantic.
Is this it?

889
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:53,167
This is it? This is...
You sound like your mother.

890
01:15:55,209 --> 01:15:59,459
You always said this much
remind her, but...

891
01:15:59,626 --> 01:16:03,375
This is why I do not want to read your work
because you take a defensive stance.

892
01:16:03,584 --> 01:16:06,083
Of course I am taking the defensive!

893
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,584
Do you know how to put all creative

894
01:16:08,751 --> 01:16:11,709
And then someone you love
says it does not understand?

895
01:16:11,876 --> 01:16:15,375
No, I do not know because I'm not creative.
Because you so chose.

896
01:16:18,334 --> 01:16:21,083
I do not want to fight.
I'm tired, nervous.

897
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:25,000
I wrote the whole night.
I just wanted you to enjoy. OK?

898
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:35,042
Thank you.

899
01:16:44,918 --> 01:16:47,584
I have news that you will not like.

900
01:16:47,751 --> 01:16:49,792
They let Reja Markus.

901
01:16:50,209 --> 01:16:52,292
What? How do you think you play him?

902
01:16:52,334 --> 01:16:55,167
The district prosecutor says
do not have enough hard evidence,

903
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,626
We have only indirect.

904
01:16:57,792 --> 01:17:00,209
He needs irrefutable evidence.

905
01:17:03,209 --> 01:17:05,334
I'm really sorry, Toni.

906
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,375
Really counted.

907
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:12,542
Bar banged him well.
No, it's not enough.

908
01:17:12,751 --> 01:17:15,042
What else can we do?

909
01:17:15,751 --> 01:17:17,959
I can think of something.

910
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:22,250
Although better come here quickly.
Will not be long here.

911
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:24,792
Good. I'll go.

912
01:17:27,792 --> 01:17:29,501
What?

913
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:32,459
I told you. I have lung cancer.

914
01:17:32,501 --> 01:17:34,667
Metastasized.

915
01:17:34,918 --> 01:17:38,876
Do you smoke all the time.
-Yes. So it goes.

916
01:17:39,042 --> 01:17:41,667
Why have to interrupt?
I'll be dead in a year.

917
01:17:41,834 --> 01:17:47,083
Court awarded Ray lawyer
behalf Jenks. Wise guy from Dallas.

918
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:50,334
He and the DA concluded an agreement
and Ray out of jail.

919
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:52,876
Politics.
When did you tell me you were sick?

920
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:54,918
Trying to forcibly evict me.

921
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:57,501
Already have the other type
planned job.

922
01:17:57,667 --> 01:18:02,083
I do not understand what you mean.
Rejected would murder case to do so? -Yes.

923
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:05,083
It gives them a reason and ammunition.

924
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,667
They said that my case
not well prepared.

925
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:10,209
That investigation was sloppy and superficial
. Without evidence.

926
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:14,292
The evidence was not properly collected,
will not hold up in court.

927
01:18:15,292 --> 01:18:19,834
Prosecutor too afraid to be
accept cases that can not lose.

928
01:18:22,709 --> 01:18:24,959
There will dismiss the case against Lua.

929
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:29,626
There is no benefit from the addition
if not middle of Reja.

930
01:18:31,042 --> 01:18:32,751
Good.

931
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,584
I was hoping you'd say that.

932
01:18:35,584 --> 01:18:40,709
They want to retire and enjoy the blessings of my
cancer elsewhere.

933
01:18:40,751 --> 01:18:43,167
Fuck you.
-I Have not told me the cancer.

934
01:18:43,209 --> 01:18:45,751
Problem with Ray is his alibi.
You got a family?

935
01:18:45,918 --> 01:18:48,876
Ray claims that he was with the little...
-Bobi. Bobi.

936
01:18:49,209 --> 01:18:50,918
What is it?

937
01:18:51,334 --> 01:18:53,417
Do you have someone in your life?

938
01:18:59,876 --> 01:19:02,918
Yes. I do not have a wife.

939
01:19:05,417 --> 01:19:08,042
I have a daughter in the Corps.

940
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:13,542
Is that helpful?

941
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:19,417
She does not know.
What can be done about it?

942
01:19:24,584 --> 01:19:29,250
In any case, Ray says he was with
the little Leila, whatever it's called,

943
01:19:29,292 --> 01:19:32,834
And she confirmed his story.
Her aunt confirmed her story.

944
01:19:32,876 --> 01:19:34,626
What are we going to do?

945
01:19:36,792 --> 01:19:41,542
The question is how serious you are
that justice is carried out.

946
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:44,876
Do you understand me?

947
01:19:51,417 --> 01:19:55,209
I can not eat. Maybe throw.
How are you going to do anything if you can not eat?

948
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:58,751
Sometimes I eat, sometimes not.
This restaurant is a disaster.

949
01:19:58,918 --> 01:20:00,626
You have to eat something.

950
01:20:11,709 --> 01:20:14,751
Let me ask you something personal.

951
01:20:15,709 --> 01:20:17,834
Unofficially. Between you and me.

952
01:20:18,626 --> 01:20:20,751
What do you want to do with Ray Marcus?

953
01:20:20,918 --> 01:20:26,209
What can he do?
-Everything you want. -Okay.

954
01:20:29,876 --> 01:20:31,751
I thought you said...

955
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:35,125
Listen.

956
01:20:36,542 --> 01:20:38,292
I have nothing to lose.

957
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:41,584
I will not let this asshole prosecutor
to screw up my last case.

958
01:20:41,792 --> 01:20:45,042
You will not keep aside
and watch how the murderer is drawn.

959
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:47,667
Video'm too sick
morons like Reja Markus

960
01:20:47,667 --> 01:20:49,501
How are released over the years.

961
01:20:49,501 --> 01:20:51,292
Are you ready to get out of the frame

962
01:20:51,292 --> 01:20:54,125
Strict procedures when it comes to this? -Yes.

963
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:55,834
Are you sure?
-Yes.

964
01:21:02,751 --> 01:21:04,709
Andes online.

965
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:09,209
Are you kidding? Okay. Thank you.

966
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:14,417
Ray appeared in the "Line Camp".

967
01:21:15,459 --> 01:21:17,792
I'm gonna let that little idiot
to surprising and drinking,

968
01:21:17,959 --> 01:21:21,584
Then I'll get him
and returned to my camp.

969
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:23,292
I want you to come with me.

970
01:21:23,334 --> 01:21:26,042
We will keep it for a while.
We'll handle it.

971
01:21:26,042 --> 01:21:29,542
It will become a little violent,
we will make him suffer.

972
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:32,083
A then we'll see what to do.

973
01:21:33,334 --> 01:21:35,375
Would you like to?

974
01:21:40,042 --> 01:21:43,584
You have to understand that this is not working.

975
01:21:43,751 --> 01:21:45,959
We do not go. -Susanna
Too... we are different.

976
01:21:45,959 --> 01:21:48,792
We're not right for each other.
-Susanna Stop.

977
01:21:48,959 --> 01:21:51,125
We're not right for each other? We're not.
-What Are you talking about?

978
01:21:51,292 --> 01:21:54,626
We're perfect for each other.
We're not, Edward.

979
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:58,250
Perhaps we were perfect for each other
that we do not live in the real world.

980
01:21:58,417 --> 01:22:01,542
Do I live in the real world
i need a structured life

981
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:03,417
Structured future.

982
01:22:03,417 --> 01:22:06,000
I want to be the person who
want me to be or not.

983
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,709
You did. You did.
I can do it. No, stop it.

984
01:22:09,751 --> 01:22:13,792
I really wanted to be a person
that you thought you did.

985
01:22:13,959 --> 01:22:16,083
Really, but I'm not that person.

986
01:22:16,083 --> 01:22:18,167
I'm cynical. No, listen.
I -Pragmatic.

987
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:21,626
No, I did. No, you are.
I'm a realist. -You are scared. -I'm not afraid.

988
01:22:21,626 --> 01:22:23,542
It is not our first time.
I'm not scared.

989
01:22:23,542 --> 01:22:26,209
I'm not scared.
-OK. -unhappy Himself.

990
01:22:29,542 --> 01:22:32,459
I'm just very, very unhappy.

991
01:22:38,042 --> 01:22:39,751
You're so...

992
01:22:40,501 --> 01:22:43,959
You are so wonderful, and you're so...

993
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:46,125
The sensitive and romantic, and...

994
01:22:46,167 --> 01:22:49,167
Slab. What? -There What you want to say.
I did not say you were bad.

995
01:22:49,209 --> 01:22:51,584
You've already talked about.
I did not say you were bad.

996
01:22:51,626 --> 01:22:53,834
You've already talked about.
Why not say again?

997
01:22:53,834 --> 01:22:56,250
Slab.
I did not say you were bad.

998
01:22:56,292 --> 01:22:58,584
I did not say that you are weak.
-Do you love me?

999
01:22:58,626 --> 01:23:00,542
It's not about that.
No, not about that!

1000
01:23:00,584 --> 01:23:04,542
No, it's not about that! -It's About it!
-Not! -You did not answer me!

1001
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:09,876
Yes, I love you.
-When You love someone...

1002
01:23:10,042 --> 01:23:11,751
Amends.

1003
01:23:11,918 --> 01:23:14,083
Do not turn your back.

1004
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:17,292
You have to be careful with that.
It may never get.

1005
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:21,083
I can not do this to
work with you, Edward.

1006
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:24,167
I can not keep doing this.

1007
01:23:24,334 --> 01:23:26,042
Susan.

1008
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:30,167
You can not turn your back on
problems all the time.

1009
01:23:39,542 --> 01:23:41,459
Come on. Come on.
-Shit.

1010
01:23:41,626 --> 01:23:45,042
I told you I do not know.

1011
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:48,417
Why do not you ask me there, man?
I'll see you soon. OK?

1012
01:23:49,751 --> 01:23:51,459
Hi, honey.

1013
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:05,584
Let's go to my camp.

1014
01:24:05,876 --> 01:24:09,792
It is located in White Creek near
barracks where they took your family.

1015
01:24:09,959 --> 01:24:11,876
Follow me.

1016
01:24:27,083 --> 01:24:28,792
Sit down.

1017
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:35,667
Jeez, I'm sick.
Toni, come here quickly.

1018
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,709
Here. Use this. OK?

1019
01:24:37,959 --> 01:24:40,751
Shoot him if exaggerated.

1020
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:51,501
Bu!
Man, this is illegal.

1021
01:24:51,501 --> 01:24:55,042
Yes it is legal, it took me
the cell, not in the shack.

1022
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:56,959
We can not be more legalistic.

1023
01:25:00,417 --> 01:25:02,125
No new evidence.

1024
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:05,918
Really? Why do not you arrest me
if you have new evidence?

1025
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:10,334
I like it here.
Is relaxed.

1026
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:13,792
It seems to me that you are trying
this trick before.

1027
01:25:13,792 --> 01:25:15,667
If you think that this type of
to break me,

1028
01:25:15,709 --> 01:25:18,042
You've already seen it does not work.
-Yes.

1029
01:25:18,209 --> 01:25:24,042
What if I told you that your drug
Lu Bates connected with the murder of Hastings?

1030
01:25:24,459 --> 01:25:26,709
If Lu did it,
arrested to me.

1031
01:25:26,876 --> 01:25:30,626
Do not worry. We'll take you to the station.
Do not worry.

1032
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:32,501
Who is this?

1033
01:25:34,209 --> 01:25:38,834
Look at that. Get in!
-Son Son. -OK.

1034
01:25:39,792 --> 01:25:42,834
OK. Come on, boy.
Come here.

1035
01:25:42,959 --> 01:25:44,959
Lu, what did you say this guy?
Nothing.

1036
01:25:45,042 --> 01:25:48,167
He said you told him I
I killed a woman and a child from that type.

1037
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,042
What? It's the same thing for you.

1038
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:54,292
You're supposed to be representative
Act. What is this shit? Fuck off.

1039
01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:56,167
Both.

1040
01:25:56,209 --> 01:26:00,209
Have you two last
words you want to say to each other?

1041
01:26:02,417 --> 01:26:06,709
Toni, I think it should be
to kill them now.

1042
01:26:06,709 --> 01:26:09,334
It will be tough for them outside,

1043
01:26:09,834 --> 01:26:11,959
Since they will not know how to handle them.

1044
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:15,834
Maybe Ray is killed
while resisting arrest.

1045
01:26:21,959 --> 01:26:24,417
Came home late at night...

1046
01:26:25,542 --> 01:26:27,626
Burglar could kill him.

1047
01:26:32,459 --> 01:26:34,709
Uneasily with you, boy?

1048
01:26:35,834 --> 01:26:38,209
Get up!

1049
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:41,417
You look uncomfortable.

1050
01:26:41,417 --> 01:26:44,501
I'm sorry.
What? -I'm sorry. -What did you say?

1051
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:46,959
I will not kill you, son.

1052
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,042
I'm a cop.

1053
01:26:49,959 --> 01:26:52,751
What is it? Plakaćeš?
Are you going to cry?

1054
01:26:55,959 --> 01:26:59,125
Well, since you feel so uncomfortable...

1055
01:26:59,501 --> 01:27:01,209
Toni, come here.

1056
01:27:01,334 --> 01:27:03,042
Take this.

1057
01:27:03,417 --> 01:27:05,417
Come here. OK?
-Please.

1058
01:27:05,459 --> 01:27:09,042
Fuck.
Exactly here. Right here. OK?

1059
01:27:09,125 --> 01:27:12,876
OK. -What about me? Maybe
is me uncomfortable.

1060
01:27:13,042 --> 01:27:15,334
Here.
Really?

1061
01:27:15,334 --> 01:27:17,584
Good. Come on.

1062
01:27:19,918 --> 01:27:22,709
Here. Free as a bird.

1063
01:27:22,792 --> 01:27:25,042
OK? What do you say to that?

1064
01:27:25,209 --> 01:27:28,000
What do you say, Tony?
What do we do with these two?

1065
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:31,918
What are you gonna do?

1066
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:34,250
What are you going to do, son?

1067
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:37,167
Come on.

1068
01:27:37,334 --> 01:27:39,042
Come on.

1069
01:27:43,751 --> 01:27:45,626
Let's go.
He's got a gun.

1070
01:27:46,459 --> 01:27:48,584
Bobbi? -Shit!
Shoot him, Toni!

1071
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,334
Come back, you little bastard!

1072
01:28:11,792 --> 01:28:13,501
Yes.

1073
01:28:13,584 --> 01:28:15,292
Yes.

1074
01:28:15,584 --> 01:28:17,292
No, please.

1075
01:28:47,626 --> 01:28:49,584
Are you okay?

1076
01:28:51,501 --> 01:28:54,125
'll Repent for this.

1077
01:28:56,292 --> 01:28:58,417
I repent now.

1078
01:29:00,667 --> 01:29:03,417
I'm a Catholic. I do not believe in abortion.

1079
01:29:05,292 --> 01:29:07,334
I'm so sorry.

1080
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,501
I feel so useless.

1081
01:29:11,918 --> 01:29:14,959
You are all but useless.
You always know what to do.

1082
01:29:16,834 --> 01:29:18,542
Thank you.

1083
01:29:23,626 --> 01:29:26,292
I think I will never be able to look
Edward

1084
01:29:26,459 --> 01:29:29,876
After what I did to his
child. He will never know.

1085
01:29:37,751 --> 01:29:40,876
What did I do?
What did I do?

1086
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,834
I promise I'll be all right.

1087
01:29:43,709 --> 01:29:46,042
I will do everything to be in order.

1088
01:29:52,876 --> 01:29:54,918
God, no.

1089
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:01,959
Edward.

1090
01:30:06,751 --> 01:30:08,459
Toni.

1091
01:30:14,626 --> 01:30:17,542
You know I had to shoot him, right?

1092
01:30:19,375 --> 01:30:23,000
I do not care what you
had to shoot him!

1093
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:27,417
I'm glad you shot him!
I'm glad he's dead!

1094
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:36,792
It was supposed to prevent!

1095
01:30:38,918 --> 01:30:42,876
I was supposed to protect them!
I should have expected this!

1096
01:30:43,334 --> 01:30:45,876
It was supposed to prevent!
-Enough.

1097
01:30:45,918 --> 01:30:49,667
It was supposed to prevent!

1098
01:30:49,834 --> 01:30:51,667
It's okay.
You're supposed to stop it!

1099
01:30:51,751 --> 01:30:53,542
It's okay.

1100
01:30:56,167 --> 01:31:00,292
Okay.
You're supposed to stop it, Bobby!

1101
01:31:00,542 --> 01:31:02,250
Look at me.

1102
01:31:02,584 --> 01:31:04,584
You're a good man.

1103
01:31:06,751 --> 01:31:08,459
You're a good man.

1104
01:31:14,209 --> 01:31:18,125
Come on, we have to stand up.
If Ray came to the road, they will have to hitchhike.

1105
01:31:18,292 --> 01:31:21,083
We have to catch him before
than catching a ride. Listen to me.

1106
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:23,083
When you come to a fork road, turn left
.

1107
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:26,042
This will take you back to the
place where you took the family.

1108
01:31:26,083 --> 01:31:28,000
I doubt that
headed for the highway.

1109
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:29,792
I will go in that direction.

1110
01:31:29,918 --> 01:31:32,876
Take this.
I have one in my car.

1111
01:31:33,209 --> 01:31:35,501
Bobbi.
-What is it?

1112
01:31:35,834 --> 01:31:38,083
Are you in trouble about all this?

1113
01:31:38,792 --> 01:31:40,542
I do not know.

1114
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:42,584
I do not give a fuck.

1115
01:31:42,918 --> 01:31:44,626
I'm dying, do you remember?

1116
01:33:28,751 --> 01:33:30,459
What the fuck!

1117
01:33:30,709 --> 01:33:34,751
Ti. Where's your friend?
-Ariving.

1118
01:33:36,292 --> 01:33:37,959
Your cop friends?

1119
01:33:41,209 --> 01:33:42,918
Around are.

1120
01:33:44,751 --> 01:33:46,459
Are they here?

1121
01:33:48,709 --> 01:33:50,417
Just me now.

1122
01:33:53,876 --> 01:33:56,459
You and that fucking gun
who do not know how to use it.

1123
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:01,334
What happened Luu?

1124
01:34:03,083 --> 01:34:05,375
Dead.
What?

1125
01:34:05,542 --> 01:34:07,709
Fucking son of a bitch.

1126
01:34:07,876 --> 01:34:11,125
This is a big problem for
your friend, you know that?

1127
01:34:11,876 --> 01:34:14,876
I do not think so.
Do not you know?

1128
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:17,834
What the fuck do you want?

1129
01:34:19,167 --> 01:34:21,792
You and that stupid gun.

1130
01:34:22,751 --> 01:34:26,959
I saw how much you're handy with
miracle. -Sit down. Have a seat.

1131
01:34:27,834 --> 01:34:29,626
Sit down or I'll kill you.

1132
01:34:36,083 --> 01:34:38,292
Listen, man.

1133
01:34:39,918 --> 01:34:46,709
Why is a nice guy like you hanging out with a guy like
Andes? He kills people.

1134
01:34:47,209 --> 01:34:49,751
You kill people.

1135
01:34:56,209 --> 01:34:59,709
Deserve it, your wife and child.

1136
01:34:59,876 --> 01:35:03,292
You mistake me understand.
It was an accident. -Accident?

1137
01:35:03,292 --> 01:35:07,292
People have to come to me
with a certain respect.

1138
01:35:07,751 --> 01:35:10,334
Some things can not tolerate.

1139
01:35:10,501 --> 01:35:13,626
When someone accuses me of something,

1140
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:16,125
I take that as an insult.

1141
01:35:16,918 --> 01:35:19,334
It gives me the right.

1142
01:35:19,501 --> 01:35:22,584
If my fish accuse
to fuck another,

1143
01:35:22,751 --> 01:35:25,375
Then go to fuck another.

1144
01:35:26,918 --> 01:35:30,501
If your daughter thinks I'm
rapist, then being raped.

1145
01:35:34,834 --> 01:35:37,042
No one will get away with
what you did to us.

1146
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:38,834
Niko.

1147
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:41,792
Niko.
Really?

1148
01:35:41,959 --> 01:35:43,667
Niko.

1149
01:35:45,167 --> 01:35:46,876
Niko.

1150
01:35:47,709 --> 01:35:51,792
Niko.
Then you just have to kill me.

1151
01:35:52,626 --> 01:35:54,334
Do not you?

1152
01:35:54,876 --> 01:35:57,375
You need to kill me.

1153
01:36:00,876 --> 01:36:03,042
You have no idea.

1154
01:36:04,542 --> 01:36:06,959
It's fun to kill people.

1155
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:09,667
You of all people should be
to try it sometime.

1156
01:36:09,834 --> 01:36:11,542
Fun?

1157
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:15,959
It's fun to kill people?

1158
01:36:20,959 --> 01:36:24,250
Did you have fun while
You killed my wife and daughter?

1159
01:36:26,626 --> 01:36:28,334
Get up.

1160
01:36:28,751 --> 01:36:32,584
Get up. Come on. Come on.

1161
01:36:34,167 --> 01:36:35,876
Come on.

1162
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:38,918
Come on.

1163
01:36:51,417 --> 01:36:53,834
I remember your fucking wife.

1164
01:36:54,626 --> 01:36:58,626
I remember fucking your wife.

1165
01:36:59,501 --> 01:37:01,542
You're too weak.

1166
01:37:01,709 --> 01:37:04,167
Too fucking bad.

1167
01:37:05,042 --> 01:37:07,501
You're too weak to do something about it.

1168
01:37:10,417 --> 01:37:12,250
Son of a bitch!

1169
01:41:23,751 --> 01:41:25,459
Edward.

1170
01:41:47,876 --> 01:41:50,167
