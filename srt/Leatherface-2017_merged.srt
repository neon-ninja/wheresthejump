1
00:00:57,328 --> 00:00:59,796
Okay, now make a wish.
Blow 'em out.

2
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:07,236
- Yay!
-All right!

3
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:09,672
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4
00:01:09,674 --> 00:01:10,706
All right.

5
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:18,081
Drayton,
where are your manners?

6
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,649
Give the first piece
to the thief.

7
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:36,766
I didn't steal
your fuckin' pigs!

8
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,869
You callin' my son a liar?
He saw your grubby hands
steal our property.

9
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:47,610
Why would I go anywhere near
your dirty pigs?

10
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:49,312
Or your filthy family?

11
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:51,814
I swear, the whole world
gonna find out

12
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:54,717
what kind of brood
you raising here, verna!

13
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,452
Shut him up. I've had enough.

14
00:01:56,454 --> 00:01:59,155
-Ohh!
-Listen to me.

15
00:01:59,157 --> 00:02:02,191
No hillbilly's gonna ruin
my son's special night.

16
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:06,629
You ready
for your present?

17
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:12,502
You know
you're my special boy.

18
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:15,371
Come on, jed.
Here you go.

19
00:02:15,373 --> 00:02:17,773
Jed.

20
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:19,709
Yeah, this is it, jed.

21
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:24,413
Now, remember,
bad people like him,

22
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:26,616
they're trying to
break our family apart.

23
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:28,618
But we're not gonna
let that happen, right?

24
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,319
Now go on now, pick it up.

25
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,922
Jed, pick it<i> up.</i>

26
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:35,291
Jed.
Jed.

27
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:37,193
Jed. Jed.

28
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:39,295
- Jed. Jed. Jed.
- Pick it up, jed.

29
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:42,465
Jed. Jed. Jed. Jed.
Jed. Jed. Jed. Jed.

30
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:45,501
- Come on now.
- -You know what you have to do.

31
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:48,838
- That's right, jed!
- -Get him, boy!

32
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,641
--Come on now, jed.

33
00:02:51,643 --> 00:02:54,210
Jed. Jed. Jed. Jed. Jed...

34
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:56,412
No! No!

35
00:02:56,414 --> 00:02:58,648
- Here you go.
- -Get him, son!

36
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,383
No!

37
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:02,652
Ohh. Ohh. Ohh. Ohh...

38
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:10,359
- No!
-You can do it!

39
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:12,862
- Whoo!

40
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:16,632
No!!!

41
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:19,602
No, please! No!

42
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:22,438
- No!!!
-Jed. Jed.

43
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,541
- Jed. Jed. Jed...

44
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:27,777
Jed, go. Go.

45
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:30,546
That's right, do it!

46
00:03:30,548 --> 00:03:32,481
Jed. Jed. Jed!

47
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:34,784
No!!!

48
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:38,521
Aaaah!

49
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:41,390
Stop! Stop now!

50
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:42,658
Aaaah!

51
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:59,642
Hey. You let us down, jed.

52
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,813
--It's okay.

53
00:04:03,815 --> 00:04:05,548
Your family's
always here for you.

54
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,717
Remember that.

55
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,718
Okay.

56
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:36,912
-You tryin' to make us crash?
-You want me to stop?

57
00:04:36,914 --> 00:04:38,948
Nah, didn't say that.

58
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:46,789
Look out!

59
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:53,629
What the hell was that thing?

60
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,431
Hey, Betty.

61
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:04,740
What is it?

62
00:05:04,742 --> 00:05:06,776
I don't know.

63
00:05:10,013 --> 00:05:11,881
Well, let's go.

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What?

65
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,367
It's just a kid.

66
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:35,938
Let's go!
We're gonna be late!

67
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,642
Hey, there.

68
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:45,114
You okay?

69
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:53,622
You shouldn't play in the road.

70
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:55,624
Help me! Please!

71
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:03,899
Hey, Betty, where you goin'?
I didn't hit him!

72
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:05,868
-There's something wrong!
-Betty!

73
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,703
He needs help!

74
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:08,971
Jesus Christ.

75
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,644
Hey, little guy, you hear me?

76
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,748
Let me help you!

77
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,487
Hello?

78
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:33,462
It's okay!
You can come out!

79
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,565
Betty!

80
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:42,605
Betty, where'd you get off to?

81
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:41,931
Hello?

82
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:48,637
Come on.

83
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,473
I won't touch you.

84
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:54,210
I just want to help.

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Okay?

86
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:25,274
You done good, jed.

87
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:27,977
Looks like you can
learn a after all.

88
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:03,012
Nubbins, go ahead
and learn him some more.

89
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:19,061
Show him.

90
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:33,609
--Where is she?!
-Take 'er easy, hal.

91
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:36,011
-Let me through, goddamnit!
-Hold it! Hold it!

92
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:38,581
-Get the fuck off me!
-We need to figure out
what happened.

93
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:42,585
-Easy there, hal.
-That's my baby in there.

94
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:45,354
Is she in there?
Is my baby in there?

95
00:09:45,356 --> 00:09:47,189
Answer me, goddamnit!

96
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:48,857
We got one of them.

97
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:51,594
Arggh!

98
00:09:57,835 --> 00:10:00,135
I couldn't
get to her on time.

99
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:02,304
I'm real sorry, sir,
i swear to god.

100
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:06,809
Drayton Sawyer.

101
00:10:08,878 --> 00:10:10,713
This time it ain't
the gorman house.

102
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:13,716
Nah. You're grown up now.

103
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:18,787
That means the gas chamber
for you.

104
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,225
For what?

105
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:25,294
You arrestin' me
for finding a body?

106
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:27,329
That ain't no crime I heard of.

107
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:29,999
How about I put a bullet
right in your fuckin' skull?

108
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:31,800
-Hold on.
-Put it away, hal.

109
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:33,902
He's right.
We ain't got nothin' on him.

110
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:36,238
Easy, hal.
Keep your head on.

111
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,740
Hal, he ain't worth it.

112
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:38,974
Come on, hal. Put the gun down.

113
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:40,809
Fuckin' trash.

114
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:53,389
You let those boys go
this instant.

115
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:56,291
Don't count on it, verna.

116
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:58,894
You see them do something wrong?
No, I didn't think so.

117
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:01,130
You uncuff him.
You let him out of the car.

118
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:02,398
No.

119
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,833
He's stayin' right there.

120
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:06,335
What for?

121
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:09,238
He's not under arrest.
He's under protection.

122
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,241
-From you.
-What are you talkin' about?

123
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:14,877
I can't count how many
crime scenes I've been to

124
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,113
where there just happened
to be Sawyers there already.

125
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:21,750
-Them kids ain't safe with you.
-Horseshit.

126
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:24,053
Send some units over
to the Sawyer house.

127
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:26,355
You round up all the minors.
I want all of them.

128
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:28,257
-You hear me?
-You can't do that.

129
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:30,292
Well, I'll have a warrant
that says I can

130
00:11:30,294 --> 00:11:32,194
by the time we arrive.

131
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:36,065
It's called child endangerment.

132
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:38,867
You take one of mine...

133
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:42,104
And I'll take all yours, verna.

134
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,011
All of 'em.

135
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:57,086
<i> In 1935, the state</i>
<i> of Texas instituted</i>

136
00:11:57,088 --> 00:11:59,321
<i> an endangered childcare</i>
<i> program.</i>

137
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:03,025
The first year nearly fifty
children were taken from homes

138
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:06,228
where criminal activity
was the norm.

139
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,264
Most of these children
were given new names

140
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:11,166
and entered into foster care.

141
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:14,336
Others, the product of
degenerate parentage,

142
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:18,741
<i> were remitted here</i>
<i> to gorman house.</i>

143
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:23,812
We take care of
their psychological
and physical needs.

144
00:12:23,814 --> 00:12:25,247
Yes, sir.

145
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:27,883
I've been wanting to
come on here for a long time.

146
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:30,252
I think I can help them--
-Elizabeth.

147
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:32,221
Oh, please, sir,
lizzy's fine.

148
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:34,757
Elizabeth.

149
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:37,826
Most of these kids
will end up in prison

150
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:39,828
or mental institutions.

151
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,166
Keeping them here
is safer for everyone.

152
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:46,201
Keep your guard up.

153
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:32,447
Well, hello.

154
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:34,082
My name is lizzy.

155
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:37,553
I'm new here, and I want
to get to know y'all.

156
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:42,825
[Man[ Oh. That's bud.

157
00:13:44,828 --> 00:13:48,297
You don't say all that much,
do you, big guy?

158
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:50,232
-Nuh-uh.
-Unh-unh.

159
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:54,903
-Uh...You're in my seat.
-Oh. Sorry.

160
00:13:54,905 --> 00:13:57,206
I thank you kindly.

161
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,507
-Uh, I'm--
-lizzy.

162
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:01,076
Yeah, I heard. I heard.

163
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:03,879
S-sorry, I'm Jackson.

164
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:07,616
Jackson and bud.

165
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:10,319
And what meds
we have you on, Jackson?

166
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:12,321
Meds, huh?

167
00:14:12,323 --> 00:14:14,423
They give 'em to us
and we take 'em, right?

168
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,928
We figured you'd know more about
all of that than us, lizzy.

169
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,030
You aren't gonna be trouble
for me, are you?

170
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:24,933
No, not me, lizzy.

171
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:28,070
Is there a reason
you keep saying my name
like that?

172
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:33,342
No, uh, I reckon I might like
how it sounds, is all.

173
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fuck you, asshole!
I'll pop your eyes right
the fuck out of your head!

174
00:14:41,252 --> 00:14:43,452
-Let him go.
-Mind your own business!

175
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:47,055
Is it my business.
What is the problem?

176
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:49,091
He said some things
i didn't care for.

177
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:51,627
Something about a girl
in a nurse uniform,

178
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:54,096
what she might taste like.

179
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:58,233
Hey! Hey! Get off me! Let go!

180
00:14:58,235 --> 00:14:59,902
Fuck you, Frankenstein!

181
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:01,603
Break it up, pinheads!

182
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:03,939
-Back to what you were doing.
-I didn't do nothin'.

183
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,577
Don't look at me.

184
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

185
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:11,139
What are you doing?

186
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:16,678
Come here.

187
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:22,150
What's the big deal?

188
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:24,019
It was just a stupid mouse.

189
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:28,557
Got a light?

190
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,226
You're not allowed
to smoke in here.

191
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:35,497
I got me special permission.

192
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:38,700
True story.
You can ask Dr. lang.

193
00:16:38,702 --> 00:16:42,671
-I will.
-He'll tell you it helps me.

194
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:46,041
On account of my anxiety.

195
00:16:48,745 --> 00:16:51,246
Truth is...

196
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:53,582
It's 'cause I'm his favorite.

197
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:55,450
He told me so.

198
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:57,786
-You just got yourself
a warnin'.
-For what?

199
00:16:57,788 --> 00:17:01,490
-I was takin' a bath.
-Get out.

200
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,028
Bitch.

201
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,365
Everything all right?

202
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:12,701
Uh, yes, Dr. lang, I'm fine.

203
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:17,773
I'll have a word
with Isaac and bud.

204
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:19,508
Bud didn't do nothin'.

205
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,744
Lookin' forward to our session
tomorrow, Jackson?

206
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:25,714
Sir, he's right, actually,
bud didn't do anything.

207
00:17:25,716 --> 00:17:28,650
He was just fighting?

208
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:31,486
-Well, he was protecting me.
-Remind me to tell you later

209
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:33,255
what he did to his last
foster family.

210
00:17:33,257 --> 00:17:35,090
They took away his dog.

211
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:37,359
Yes.

212
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:41,329
That's a perfectly good reason
to bludgeon somebody
into a coma.

213
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:44,533
Yeah, well, I'm just sayin'.

214
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
--I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.
You didn't.

215
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:23,238
Thanks for helping bud.

216
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,510
I know you don't even know him,
so that's, um, that's nice.

217
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:30,479
Well, I'm here to help you all.

218
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,750
You're the first nice one
we've had around here.

219
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:41,289
So I thought you should know.

220
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,625
Know what?

221
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:46,628
What goes on in the ect chamber.

222
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,766
Kids around here
got to callin' that
Dr. lang's chamber of horrors.

223
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:52,868
Piece of shit.

224
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,170
Why is that?

225
00:18:55,172 --> 00:18:59,508
You drop by tonight,
you can find out for yourself.

226
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,510
I think maybe you could even
do something about it.

227
00:19:03,312 --> 00:19:05,213
Yeah.

228
00:19:05,215 --> 00:19:06,781
Jackson.

229
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:11,486
You're gonna get out of here
some day.

230
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:15,290
And just because you can't
trust certain people...

231
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:18,627
It doesn't mean
you shouldn't trust others.

232
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:20,629
Yeah, I'll think about that.

233
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,175
I'm sorry to
keep you waiting.

234
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:36,178
Barry Farnsworth.
We've been here an hour.

235
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,679
We?

236
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:44,219
- Miss Sawyer.
- [Farnsworth
it's Mrs. Carson now.

237
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:51,593
I want to see jed.

238
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:53,762
We've been through this before.

239
00:19:53,764 --> 00:19:55,664
Year after year.

240
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,232
He's my son.

241
00:19:57,234 --> 00:19:59,334
And I can afford me
a lawyer now.

242
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:00,902
Which changes nothin'.

243
00:20:00,904 --> 00:20:05,407
He was taken from you
for a<i> reason.</i>

244
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:06,975
Show him.

245
00:20:06,977 --> 00:20:10,312
It's an injunction.
The court says

246
00:20:10,314 --> 00:20:12,781
Mrs. Carson has the right
to visit.

247
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:22,524
You have to let me see him.

248
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:25,560
You bring me jed.

249
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:27,395
Well, that's a problem.

250
00:20:27,397 --> 00:20:30,365
Most of these kids
are given a new name

251
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:34,269
so they can hide
from their degenerate...

252
00:20:34,271 --> 00:20:36,638
Criminal families.

253
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,341
Jed probably wouldn't be able
to recall you

254
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:41,009
or even his real name.

255
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:42,877
But you know who he is.

256
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,546
You and that sideways ranger.

257
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:45,647
You know 'em all.

258
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:49,251
I have a lot of patients.

259
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:52,020
We'll have to check the records
to be certain...

260
00:20:52,022 --> 00:20:55,423
That's bullshit.
...And that requires

261
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:58,660
an entirely different
court order.

262
00:20:59,895 --> 00:21:02,764
The records are very sensitive.

263
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:05,700
Get me the correct court order,

264
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:08,570
I'll be happy to help you.

265
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:10,705
That one took three months
to get!

266
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,674
Then I advise you
to get on it quick!

267
00:21:12,676 --> 00:21:15,277
Jed is eighteen soon.

268
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,612
I'll recommend
he be transferred to prison.

269
00:21:17,614 --> 00:21:20,382
You're a bastard.

270
00:21:20,384 --> 00:21:22,284
Even though
you married into money

271
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:25,820
and hired yourself
a snot-nose shyster,

272
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:30,759
you are still hillbilly trash.

273
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,034
I have a friend,
a country clerk,

274
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:40,669
maybe he can push it through.

275
00:21:40,671 --> 00:21:41,870
It don't matter!
It's all bullshit!

276
00:21:41,872 --> 00:21:43,471
- Whoa!
-Lavatory.

277
00:21:43,473 --> 00:21:44,606
That way.

278
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:54,783
I warned you, bud,
but you wouldn't listen.

279
00:21:57,787 --> 00:22:00,722
Come on, man up, bud.
This is for your own good.

280
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:11,960
Go get her.
Office hours are over.

281
00:23:11,962 --> 00:23:14,863
I can't go into
the ladies' room.

282
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:26,574
-Ma'am?
-It's Mrs. Carson.

283
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,678
Goddamnit, she's gone!

284
00:23:35,751 --> 00:23:38,620
Get-- get...Off me!

285
00:23:39,688 --> 00:23:40,655
Get out--

286
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:46,461
jed, I'm coming!

287
00:23:46,463 --> 00:23:49,664
<i> Jed! Jed!</i>
- What in the hell is that?

288
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:50,999
<i> I'm here for you!</i>

289
00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:54,602
<i> -You hear me?</i>
-What is it?

290
00:23:57,741 --> 00:23:59,707
You're next, Isaac.

291
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:04,746
Are we ready?

292
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,213
--What the hell is that?

293
00:24:42,585 --> 00:24:45,920
--Jed! Jed!

294
00:24:45,922 --> 00:24:47,155
You can't be here!

295
00:24:48,624 --> 00:24:50,658
Damn that woman.
I'll be back.

296
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,594
<i> Jed!</i>

297
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:57,499
--Jed!

298
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,664
Lizzy. Come quick.

299
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:31,165
The kids are loose
in the halls.

300
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:35,236
Help me.

301
00:25:38,274 --> 00:25:40,642
Jed? Jed--

302
00:25:40,644 --> 00:25:41,943
get your hands off me!

303
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,891
No way, she--

304
00:25:58,027 --> 00:25:59,327
my client was acting

305
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:01,996
in self-defense.
-Get out. Get out.

306
00:26:01,998 --> 00:26:03,965
She was--

307
00:26:07,704 --> 00:26:10,104
that's it. Lock it down.

308
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:27,622
I can't believe you did that.

309
00:26:53,382 --> 00:26:55,316
Want to give me a hand?

310
00:26:55,318 --> 00:26:58,019
I saw you with him.

311
00:26:58,021 --> 00:27:03,725
And you<i> know</i>
that ike is my soul mate.

312
00:27:14,803 --> 00:27:17,839
There's an emergency exit
in the basement.

313
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:19,974
Come on, follow me!

314
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:24,312
I told you a thousand times
we're understaffed.

315
00:27:24,314 --> 00:27:25,813
Just get here before they--

316
00:27:27,984 --> 00:27:31,252
ah-- just<i> hurry.</i>

317
00:27:32,722 --> 00:27:34,722
--Who's there?

318
00:27:58,947 --> 00:28:00,214
Don't be stupid, bud.

319
00:28:01,383 --> 00:28:03,084
Bud?

320
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:05,319
They'll never let you go.

321
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:07,321
Think about it, bud!

322
00:28:21,403 --> 00:28:24,205
Let's get the fuck out of here,
y'all!

323
00:28:26,442 --> 00:28:29,444
Ike, where you at?
Ike!

324
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,353
-Let's hide.
-Hide.

325
00:29:12,355 --> 00:29:13,888
Right here.

326
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

327
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

328
00:30:01,937 --> 00:30:03,070
Come on.

329
00:30:08,377 --> 00:30:10,378
Jackson's got a hostage.

330
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,079
Hey what's up!

331
00:30:12,081 --> 00:30:14,248
Hey, doc has a nice ride.

332
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:18,452
- Don't touch him!
- -Let go of me!

333
00:30:18,454 --> 00:30:21,589
- Be quiet!
-Let go!

334
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:24,091
You fuck!

335
00:30:28,397 --> 00:30:30,932
They'll think twice
about shooting us down

336
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:32,033
with her along.

337
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:34,068
They will!

338
00:30:45,347 --> 00:30:46,480
Hey.

339
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:49,350
Hop in, stupid.
I owe you one.

340
00:30:58,428 --> 00:31:00,928
Fuck you, gorman!

341
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:27,154
Well, don't you look nice.

342
00:31:27,156 --> 00:31:30,658
You just had to bring the
prettiest nurse along with us,
didn't you?

343
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,660
Well, I didn't pick her.

344
00:31:32,662 --> 00:31:35,096
No, Jackson did.

345
00:31:35,098 --> 00:31:38,266
You got no reason
to be jealous.

346
00:31:38,268 --> 00:31:42,203
Why'd I be jealous of someone
who's about to die?

347
00:31:42,205 --> 00:31:44,372
Everything at the proper time.

348
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jackson!
Oh, here we go.

349
00:32:02,058 --> 00:32:05,293
Hey, where do you think
you're going, bitch!

350
00:32:05,295 --> 00:32:06,527
Unhh!

351
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:08,129
Put me down, put me down.

352
00:32:08,131 --> 00:32:09,497
Fuck you!

353
00:32:18,074 --> 00:32:20,474
Let go of me! Let go of me!

354
00:32:24,313 --> 00:32:29,283
Do that again, I'll turn you
into strawberry pie.

355
00:32:29,285 --> 00:32:33,087
I'm gonna kill him,
I'm gonna kill him,

356
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:36,190
right before your eyes.

357
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:41,062
And that goes for you two,
as well.

358
00:32:41,064 --> 00:32:43,731
Anyone bolts,

359
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:45,633
and everyone dies.

360
00:32:45,635 --> 00:32:48,402
- You son of a bitch.
- Jackson, wait.

361
00:32:48,404 --> 00:32:51,572
We're all gonna look out
for each other. It's okay.

362
00:32:56,645 --> 00:32:59,046
Change.

363
00:32:59,048 --> 00:33:01,182
No, you ain't makin' her
get undressed.

364
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,516
Oh, ain't I?

365
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:06,320
You got clothes underneath?

366
00:33:08,724 --> 00:33:10,191
All right.

367
00:33:20,068 --> 00:33:21,402
Cut it out, you bastard,

368
00:33:21,404 --> 00:33:24,071
before I slit her throat.

369
00:33:24,073 --> 00:33:27,274
That ain't no way
to talk about our new friend.

370
00:33:27,276 --> 00:33:29,677
She's going with us all the way.

371
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,612
Where are you takin' us?

372
00:33:31,614 --> 00:33:32,747
Mexico.

373
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:36,317
Perhaps you've heard of it?

374
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:38,452
Gonna find us some money,
find us some more wheels,

375
00:33:38,454 --> 00:33:40,688
go past Austin, see my mom.

376
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,390
Y'all be welcome there,

377
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:44,125
my mama loves company.

378
00:33:46,428 --> 00:33:48,262
And soon as we get
to the Mexican border,

379
00:33:48,264 --> 00:33:50,264
we go our separate ways.

380
00:33:53,268 --> 00:33:56,537
Jackson, you got someplace
you want to get to?

381
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:59,440
You got family somewhere?

382
00:33:59,442 --> 00:34:01,275
No.

383
00:34:01,277 --> 00:34:03,477
No, Mexico sounds like a plan.

384
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,326
-You sorells?
- Yes, sir.

385
00:34:19,328 --> 00:34:21,328
Glad you could make it.

386
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,330
-We know which one did this?
-No.

387
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:24,832
We know who's missing.

388
00:34:24,834 --> 00:34:26,700
They're pulling up the files
for us right now.

389
00:34:26,702 --> 00:34:29,770
I bet I know who it was.

390
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:33,641
This ain't the work
of a confused child.

391
00:34:33,643 --> 00:34:35,676
This is evil.

392
00:34:35,678 --> 00:34:37,678
Needs puttin' down.

393
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:47,154
They all mine?

394
00:34:47,156 --> 00:34:50,224
All but one were brought in
by you, yeah.

395
00:34:54,096 --> 00:34:55,629
Roadblocks set?

396
00:34:55,631 --> 00:34:58,466
Ten. Twenty miles out.
Push 'em out more.

397
00:34:58,468 --> 00:35:00,768
I want every local cop
from here to new Mexico

398
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,370
on the lookout.
-Yes, sir.

399
00:35:34,536 --> 00:35:35,870
Hello.

400
00:35:37,405 --> 00:35:40,274
They're loose. Cops lookin'?

401
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:44,879
Yeah, of course we'll pay ya.

402
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:47,281
You just keep us updated.

403
00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:49,316
We're gonna find jed.

404
00:36:03,598 --> 00:36:05,799
-Lang's car was just spotted.
-Where?

405
00:36:05,801 --> 00:36:09,370
South on 385.
I'll meet you there.

406
00:36:09,372 --> 00:36:11,505
Sorells.

407
00:36:11,507 --> 00:36:13,274
Yes, sir.

408
00:36:13,276 --> 00:36:15,643
Knowing these kids the way I do,

409
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:18,312
they ain't givin' up easy.

410
00:36:18,314 --> 00:36:21,382
-I understand.
-I don't think you do.

411
00:36:21,384 --> 00:36:24,485
Just 'cause they're kids,
i don't want your men
going soft.

412
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:27,288
If they gotta shoot first,
then let god sort it out,

413
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,723
well, that's permissible.

414
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:31,358
Copy that?

415
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,726
Copy.

416
00:36:52,314 --> 00:36:53,914
Fuck, I'm hungry.

417
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:55,549
I thought the plan
was not to be seen.

418
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:57,885
People are looking for a group
with a mongoloid.

419
00:36:57,887 --> 00:36:59,486
We go in separate.

420
00:36:59,488 --> 00:37:02,389
And you stays outside.

421
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:04,658
And you stays quiet.

422
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,661
-We have no money.
-Blah blah fuckin' blah.

423
00:37:07,663 --> 00:37:09,797
We improvise.
There's food, there's money,

424
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:11,498
and there's cars to grab.
Get in there.

425
00:37:19,242 --> 00:37:20,908
Want me to see if I can
throw it in your mouth?

426
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,875
-Yeah.
-Okay.

427
00:37:22,911 --> 00:37:24,645
Oh, yeah.

428
00:37:26,015 --> 00:37:27,748
You all right, darlin'?

429
00:37:29,484 --> 00:37:30,551
Ma'am?

430
00:37:30,553 --> 00:37:32,753
You haven't touched your food.

431
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:35,723
I'm just not hungry, I guess.

432
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:37,391
I'll bag it up for you.

433
00:37:39,728 --> 00:37:41,895
Throw it in my mouth.

434
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:47,635
- Aah!

435
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:51,672
What the fuck you lookin' at?

436
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:56,644
Yeah, that's right, nothin'.

437
00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:00,814
Everybody think
they can look down on us.

438
00:38:00,816 --> 00:38:02,583
It's not funny.

439
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:04,285
You know,

440
00:38:04,287 --> 00:38:06,887
why don't you check to see
if he's got a gun?

441
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:15,529
He's got a gun.

442
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:18,666
Let's start some shit up.

443
00:38:18,668 --> 00:38:19,733
Okay.

444
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:23,804
I wish this was just normal.

445
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:26,373
I wish we were just
two people...

446
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:29,009
Here at a diner, you know.

447
00:38:31,046 --> 00:38:33,080
I wish I was somebody else.

448
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,088
Sorry, y'all. That was my fault.

449
00:38:45,694 --> 00:38:47,761
Think it's time y'all clear out.

450
00:38:47,763 --> 00:38:49,430
Pay up and go.

451
00:38:59,908 --> 00:39:01,408
Goddamn!

452
00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:04,712
Holy shit!

453
00:39:14,823 --> 00:39:16,123
Fuck, I love Texas.

454
00:39:18,493 --> 00:39:20,694
Everybody go ahead
and put your keys and cash

455
00:39:20,696 --> 00:39:21,962
on the edge of the table.

456
00:39:21,964 --> 00:39:23,731
Clarice, get a bag.

457
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:25,532
Put your cash on the table, man!

458
00:39:25,534 --> 00:39:27,968
-Clarice?
-Coming.

459
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,570
Put your money on the table.

460
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:32,740
Are you all deaf?
Get your fuckin' money out now!

461
00:39:32,742 --> 00:39:35,109
-Get it on the table!
-Come on! We ain't got all day!

462
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:36,777
Fuck you!

463
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:38,579
-You!
-Let's go!

464
00:39:38,581 --> 00:39:40,714
-Give it up!
-No, wait!

465
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:42,850
Thank you!

466
00:39:42,852 --> 00:39:44,051
Let's go!

467
00:39:46,855 --> 00:39:48,455
Fuck!

468
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,859
-Ow!
-No.

469
00:39:51,861 --> 00:39:53,026
Where you go, bitch?

470
00:39:53,028 --> 00:39:55,729
-Keep a hold of her!
-Stop it!

471
00:40:16,084 --> 00:40:17,785
Let me go!

472
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:23,891
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

473
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:27,594
Come on! Come on! Go!

474
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:29,596
Get in!

475
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:15,843
Yep, it were them.

476
00:41:15,845 --> 00:41:17,644
No doubt about it.

477
00:41:20,915 --> 00:41:22,916
What happened?

478
00:41:22,918 --> 00:41:25,219
They went buck-shit crazy.

479
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:26,954
Cuttin' up with the waitress.

480
00:41:26,956 --> 00:41:29,089
Then they started shootin'.

481
00:41:31,226 --> 00:41:33,093
You see which way they went?

482
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:35,095
What car they took?

483
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:38,031
Maybe they left in a wagon.

484
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:41,502
-What color?
-Blue, I reckon.

485
00:41:41,504 --> 00:41:43,604
Or gray.

486
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:45,806
A Ford.

487
00:41:45,808 --> 00:41:47,274
Hey,

488
00:41:47,276 --> 00:41:51,144
could have at least stolen a car
with a full tank of gas.

489
00:41:51,146 --> 00:41:52,913
I don't look
at the gas Gauge

490
00:41:52,915 --> 00:41:55,148
when someone's shooting me,
asshole.

491
00:42:30,985 --> 00:42:32,119
Quiet, now.

492
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:36,189
Clarice, get over here.

493
00:42:37,926 --> 00:42:39,293
Get the door.

494
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:41,161
Okay, on three, right? One,

495
00:42:41,163 --> 00:42:43,630
two, three.

496
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:50,737
Smells like an old barn.

497
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:52,639
You first, lizzy.

498
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:55,275
Well, go on and get in there.

499
00:42:55,277 --> 00:42:57,578
Get the fuck in.

500
00:42:58,913 --> 00:43:00,581
Check it out, all right?

501
00:43:16,698 --> 00:43:19,800
Well, it's as good a place
as any for the night.

502
00:43:19,802 --> 00:43:22,903
We can rest up,
let the cops pass us up,

503
00:43:22,905 --> 00:43:25,639
enjoy my mama's barbecue
by dinnertime.

504
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

505
00:43:55,737 --> 00:43:59,072
Guess he died of loneliness.

506
00:44:04,245 --> 00:44:07,881
- Sit down.
- -You're gonna be okay.

507
00:44:07,883 --> 00:44:10,317
Okay.

508
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,386
I'm just gonna take a look,
okay?

509
00:44:12,388 --> 00:44:16,957
You're gonna be okay,
but I gotta put some
pressure on it.

510
00:44:16,959 --> 00:44:18,859
Moonshine.

511
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:20,961
That's good, that's good,
that's good.

512
00:44:20,963 --> 00:44:23,930
--Now breathe slow.

513
00:44:23,932 --> 00:44:26,800
-Come on, come on.
-Let's go. Let's go.

514
00:44:26,802 --> 00:44:29,202
Squeeze. Make it better.

515
00:44:29,204 --> 00:44:31,238
Big arms like that
and that's all you got?

516
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,040
That's good.

517
00:44:35,743 --> 00:44:38,211
We just gotta put
some pressure on it. Okay?

518
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:44,885
Jesus.

519
00:45:03,104 --> 00:45:05,272
Man, you're lucky I love you.

520
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:12,312
Want some of this?

521
00:45:12,314 --> 00:45:13,847
All right.

522
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:21,822
Make you feel better.

523
00:45:21,824 --> 00:45:24,357
Oh, god. Really?

524
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:26,359
Well, why not?

525
00:45:26,361 --> 00:45:28,462
What else we gonna do?
-Yeah.

526
00:45:34,035 --> 00:45:35,302
Easy.

527
00:45:35,304 --> 00:45:37,437
--Yeah.

528
00:46:57,852 --> 00:47:00,420
You're gonna aggravate
your condition.

529
00:47:02,924 --> 00:47:06,827
My condition?

530
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:09,196
What do you know about me?

531
00:47:10,498 --> 00:47:12,499
What now?

532
00:47:12,501 --> 00:47:15,435
You know she's seen our files.

533
00:47:15,437 --> 00:47:17,270
So?

534
00:47:17,272 --> 00:47:20,440
So, she knows where
all those foster moms

535
00:47:20,442 --> 00:47:22,876
who gave you shit live now.

536
00:47:22,878 --> 00:47:25,111
No, I don't.

537
00:47:25,113 --> 00:47:27,113
I only saw your medical charts,
i swear.

538
00:47:27,115 --> 00:47:28,315
She's lying, Jackson.

539
00:47:28,317 --> 00:47:32,352
She says she doesn't know.

540
00:47:32,354 --> 00:47:34,588
Who cares if she saw anything?

541
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:37,490
You don't want to find your
family?

542
00:47:37,492 --> 00:47:41,094
Bud's the only family I got.

543
00:47:41,096 --> 00:47:44,564
No real family.

544
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:47,067
That's all I want.

545
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:50,136
I thought you said your family
were in Austin,

546
00:47:50,138 --> 00:47:51,605
they'd be thrilled to see you.

547
00:47:51,607 --> 00:47:53,540
They keep fuckin' movin'.

548
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:55,609
I swear, I don't know.

549
00:47:58,279 --> 00:48:01,281
Come on, man,
let's leave her be.

550
00:48:01,283 --> 00:48:04,584
You sweet on her now?

551
00:48:04,586 --> 00:48:07,554
Fine...Lover boy.

552
00:48:07,556 --> 00:48:13,159
Hey, good luck getting it up
with all the junk
they got you on.

553
00:48:13,161 --> 00:48:16,096
Sleep tight, asshole.

554
00:48:18,032 --> 00:48:20,267
Bud, you're on first watch.

555
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:22,669
Get your ass out of bed.

556
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What'd I tell you
about running away?
Let go of me!

557
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:14,614
I guess I'm just too intense.

558
00:50:14,616 --> 00:50:17,117
I think for the benefit
of folks sleeping

559
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,119
you best keep your mouth shut.

560
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:35,368
Run!

561
00:50:51,052 --> 00:50:55,455
What in the holy hell
is going on here?!

562
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:07,634
This little piggy's
the worst goddamn lookout
in the lone star state.

563
00:51:07,636 --> 00:51:11,304
And this little piggy
just tried to abandon us all.

564
00:51:11,306 --> 00:51:14,407
Including his girlfriend here.

565
00:51:18,446 --> 00:51:21,748
Well, then maybe it's time
we get rid of
all this dead weight.

566
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:27,253
Calm down. We got a plan
and we're stickin' to it.

567
00:51:27,255 --> 00:51:30,457
Take these two back
to the trailer, okay?
Don't take your eyes off 'em.

568
00:51:30,459 --> 00:51:32,625
Bud, you're an idiot and a fool

569
00:51:32,627 --> 00:51:34,561
and I don't know why god
bothered to make you.

570
00:51:34,563 --> 00:51:36,229
Now get away from me.

571
00:51:50,611 --> 00:51:52,512
Shit.

572
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

573
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:39,886
Where's ike?

574
00:53:39,888 --> 00:53:41,955
Hey!

575
00:53:41,957 --> 00:53:43,456
Where's ike?

576
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:48,294
Maybe you should
keep your voice down in case
somebody else is out there.

577
00:53:48,296 --> 00:53:50,897
And maybe you should
kiss my texan ass.

578
00:53:57,938 --> 00:53:59,572
Ike!

579
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:03,977
Where's bud?

580
00:54:03,979 --> 00:54:05,612
Oh, shit.

581
00:54:08,649 --> 00:54:09,882
Ike!

582
00:54:11,518 --> 00:54:13,720
Ike!

583
00:54:14,888 --> 00:54:16,689
Okay, come on.
Ike?

584
00:54:16,691 --> 00:54:19,425
Jackson! This is our chance.
Let's run.

585
00:54:19,427 --> 00:54:20,760
If she finds bud
she's gonna kill him.

586
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:23,296
Bud can take care of himself.

587
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,312
Ike, where you at!

588
00:54:50,624 --> 00:54:51,791
Whoa, stop!

589
00:54:51,793 --> 00:54:53,359
What?

590
00:54:54,928 --> 00:54:56,929
You don't want to see it.

591
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:04,671
Bud, you okay?

592
00:55:11,312 --> 00:55:12,979
Hey.

593
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:15,014
What did you do, big guy?

594
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:16,849
Come on, let's get you up.

595
00:55:16,851 --> 00:55:17,984
Come on.

596
00:55:17,986 --> 00:55:19,319
I got ya.

597
00:55:19,321 --> 00:55:22,322
Let me get a look at you.

598
00:55:22,324 --> 00:55:23,589
Let's go.

599
00:55:40,774 --> 00:55:42,942
Ike, where you at!

600
00:55:45,479 --> 00:55:46,679
Ike?

601
00:55:50,552 --> 00:55:53,519
Nope. Hands up, darlin'.

602
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:55,355
It's over.

603
00:55:56,523 --> 00:55:57,990
I got one!

604
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,727
Drop the gun.

605
00:56:02,363 --> 00:56:03,763
I said drop it.

606
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:08,034
All right, now turn around.

607
00:56:12,506 --> 00:56:14,073
Where are the others at?

608
00:56:14,075 --> 00:56:17,744
What do you mean the others?
It's just me and ike.

609
00:56:17,746 --> 00:56:21,047
And I can't find him.

610
00:56:21,049 --> 00:56:23,883
Just tell me
where the others are,
and you'll be safe and sound.

611
00:56:23,885 --> 00:56:25,051
What do we got?

612
00:56:27,421 --> 00:56:29,822
Fuckin' hartman.

613
00:56:29,824 --> 00:56:32,825
He won't ask but once.
Just tell me where they are.

614
00:56:32,827 --> 00:56:35,027
What'd she say?

615
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:38,064
That it's just her and Isaac.
She don't know where he is.

616
00:56:38,066 --> 00:56:40,633
Nothin' but bullshit then, huh?

617
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:44,670
Good to see ya again, Clarice.

618
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:47,473
Aaah!

619
00:56:47,475 --> 00:56:49,976
Jesus Christ, hartman!
You coulda killed her.

620
00:56:49,978 --> 00:56:53,813
Get everybody to spread out.
They're close.

621
00:56:53,815 --> 00:56:55,081
Dogs are on the way.

622
00:56:55,083 --> 00:56:57,850
All right, fan out!
Wide circle.

623
00:56:57,852 --> 00:56:59,419
They're somewhere close by,
okay?

624
00:56:59,421 --> 00:57:01,454
Don't!

625
00:57:04,459 --> 00:57:05,892
Yeah, you laugh it up, girl.

626
00:57:05,894 --> 00:57:09,061
Let's see how funny this gets.

627
00:57:09,063 --> 00:57:11,564
Feel that? Huh?

628
00:57:11,566 --> 00:57:13,833
Hey.

629
00:57:13,835 --> 00:57:16,936
This is your last chance, baby,
to tell me what I want to know.

630
00:57:16,938 --> 00:57:19,205
--Huh?

631
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:20,573
Don't!

632
00:57:20,575 --> 00:57:23,142
Where. They. At?

633
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:34,921
<i> Cops! Cops!</i>

634
00:57:34,923 --> 00:57:36,222
<i> Fuckin' cops!</i>

635
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:41,227
Fuckin' cops!

636
00:57:44,165 --> 00:57:46,532
Shit. Hide! Go, go. Go on.

637
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:53,072
Oh, fuck.

638
00:57:53,074 --> 00:57:54,507
Who is he?

639
00:57:54,509 --> 00:57:56,843
Rounds up kids like us.
Bad news.

640
00:58:03,651 --> 00:58:04,917
He's a policeman.

641
00:58:04,919 --> 00:58:06,519
Yeah, a policeman
that broke my nose once.

642
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:08,054
-He can help us.
-He's a corrupt son of a bitch

643
00:58:08,056 --> 00:58:09,989
who has it out for kids
that get into trouble.

644
00:58:09,991 --> 00:58:13,059
He filled gorman house
almost single-handedly.

645
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:16,028
--Get. Come on.

646
00:58:24,104 --> 00:58:26,105
Get down there.

647
00:58:26,107 --> 00:58:28,708
Come on out!

648
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,843
Y'all got nowhere to go!

649
00:58:37,284 --> 00:58:39,085
You want to let me in
on the joke?

650
00:58:39,087 --> 00:58:41,087
Fuck you, pig.

651
00:58:41,089 --> 00:58:44,590
You're the fuckin' joke.
You ain't shit.

652
00:58:44,592 --> 00:58:46,626
I said come out!

653
00:58:49,796 --> 00:58:51,898
Your friends got guns in there?

654
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,866
You ain't law.

655
00:58:53,868 --> 00:58:56,536
You're just a sad old man...

656
00:58:56,538 --> 00:59:00,139
Cryin' over his stupid,
dead little girl.

657
00:59:04,112 --> 00:59:07,046
If you go, me and bud
will be next.

658
00:59:07,048 --> 00:59:10,082
Holy shit, hartman!

659
00:59:10,084 --> 00:59:13,819
Jesus fuck, hartman!
You out of your mind?

660
00:59:13,821 --> 00:59:16,222
You forget what
these fuckin' kids
did at the diner?

661
00:59:16,224 --> 00:59:17,857
It's called justice, boy.

662
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:27,300
Let go of me!

663
00:59:41,882 --> 00:59:43,082
Get in there.

664
00:59:54,161 --> 00:59:55,628
What do you got?

665
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:56,829
<i> We got a body.</i>

666
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:59,065
It's not one of them.

667
00:59:59,067 --> 01:00:00,333
It's been in there a while.

668
01:00:00,335 --> 01:00:03,002
Let's move out.

669
01:00:03,004 --> 01:00:05,071
They gotta be close.

670
01:00:13,313 --> 01:00:15,214
Lizzy!

671
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:17,016
Hey!

672
01:00:17,018 --> 01:00:18,784
Ohh.

673
01:00:21,888 --> 01:00:24,757
- <i> -Fan out!</i>
- Shit. Dogs.

674
01:00:24,759 --> 01:00:27,193
<i> We just got something</i>
<i> over here!</i>

675
01:00:28,796 --> 01:00:30,262
They been here.

676
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:39,171
It's nothin'.
Head over the Ridge.

677
01:02:42,829 --> 01:02:44,797
Hey! Hey!

678
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:47,399
Stop! Please stop!

679
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,503
Stop!

680
01:02:53,807 --> 01:02:58,344
Dispatch. I got three suspects
at the old bridge.

681
01:02:58,346 --> 01:03:01,213
<i> Copy that.</i>
<i> Backup is on the way.</i>

682
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,984
Don't you fuckin' move!

683
01:03:08,955 --> 01:03:10,523
Get back! Stay back!

684
01:03:12,192 --> 01:03:14,160
No!!!

685
01:03:41,856 --> 01:03:44,356
Stop! Stop it!

686
01:03:47,294 --> 01:03:50,262
- Roaring]

687
01:04:00,373 --> 01:04:02,374
They fucking killed bud! Fuck!

688
01:04:02,376 --> 01:04:04,176
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

689
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:06,011
Fuck! Fuck!

690
01:04:06,013 --> 01:04:10,049
Fuck! Why'd you run away?!
Why the fuck did you run away?!

691
01:04:10,051 --> 01:04:12,585
You're insane.
You just killed that cop.

692
01:04:12,587 --> 01:04:15,287
You got bud killed!
You got bud fucking killed!

693
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:17,556
Fuck! Fuck!

694
01:04:17,558 --> 01:04:20,893
You're just like everybody else.
You fuckin' liar.

695
01:04:20,895 --> 01:04:23,128
Why'd I think you'd be
any different?

696
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:25,064
Fuck!

697
01:04:30,437 --> 01:04:32,471
It's hartman! Drive! Drive!

698
01:05:16,284 --> 01:05:18,150
<i> Hartman?</i>

699
01:05:18,152 --> 01:05:20,986
<i> Come in, hartman, you there?</i>

700
01:05:20,988 --> 01:05:22,354
<i> Hartman?</i>

701
01:05:38,004 --> 01:05:39,438
<i> Hartman, come in.</i>

702
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,473
<i> It's sorells. Can you hear?</i>

703
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:45,577
<i> Hartman?</i>

704
01:05:45,579 --> 01:05:47,279
<i> Hartman, come in.</i>

705
01:05:57,724 --> 01:05:59,425
Hello?

706
01:05:59,427 --> 01:06:01,060
My name is Elizabeth white.

707
01:06:03,296 --> 01:06:07,132
I was kidnapped
from gorman house
and held hostage.

708
01:06:07,134 --> 01:06:08,667
<i> Elizabeth?</i>

709
01:06:08,669 --> 01:06:11,503
This is trooper sorells,
Texas state police.

710
01:06:11,505 --> 01:06:12,638
Where you at, girl?

711
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:17,076
I don't know.

712
01:06:17,078 --> 01:06:19,445
I'm locked in the back
of a police car.

713
01:06:19,447 --> 01:06:21,747
Why don't you go on
and tell me what you see?

714
01:06:21,749 --> 01:06:23,248
<i> An old barn.</i>

715
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:26,352
Looks like it might collapse.

716
01:06:26,354 --> 01:06:28,721
<i> All right, you stay put,</i>
<i> darlin'.</i>

717
01:06:28,723 --> 01:06:31,056
Dispatch? I'm on it.

718
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

719
01:06:49,709 --> 01:06:51,176
Get down there.

720
01:06:54,581 --> 01:06:57,116
Jackson?

721
01:06:57,118 --> 01:06:59,018
There is no Jackson, honey.

722
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:02,221
It's jed. Jedidiah Sawyer.

723
01:07:05,058 --> 01:07:07,092
What are you doing to him?

724
01:07:07,094 --> 01:07:09,495
I'm settin' things right.

725
01:07:12,632 --> 01:07:14,600
You know where he started?

726
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:19,071
Killin' my little girl.

727
01:07:19,073 --> 01:07:23,375
-Right here.
-Please let me go.

728
01:07:24,778 --> 01:07:26,745
You ain't goin' nowhere.

729
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:32,451
This shit's about to get fun.

730
01:07:49,202 --> 01:07:50,602
What do you want?

731
01:07:50,604 --> 01:07:52,738
-Where's verna?
-Other side of town.

732
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:56,341
-Carson estate.
-She's not there.

733
01:07:56,343 --> 01:07:58,143
Look, it's about jed.

734
01:08:01,347 --> 01:08:05,150
Pig is here.
Says it's about jed.

735
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,627
What is it?

736
01:08:15,629 --> 01:08:18,664
Hartman's got your boy.

737
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:21,200
Holed up in an old barn
somewhere.

738
01:08:21,202 --> 01:08:23,235
-Sound familiar?
-Sounds right.

739
01:08:23,237 --> 01:08:26,371
Hey. What about me?

740
01:08:26,373 --> 01:08:28,640
What about you?

741
01:08:28,642 --> 01:08:30,676
I thought we had an arrangement.

742
01:08:30,678 --> 01:08:34,513
You know? Some kind
of understanding?

743
01:08:40,553 --> 01:08:42,287
That we did.

744
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:02,608
Pig.

745
01:09:05,378 --> 01:09:06,912
No.

746
01:09:06,914 --> 01:09:09,348
No. No, no.

747
01:09:10,517 --> 01:09:13,418
No. No! Aah!

748
01:09:25,599 --> 01:09:27,266
Let's go get jed.

749
01:09:27,268 --> 01:09:29,401
He's at the old barn.

750
01:09:29,403 --> 01:09:32,237
You sure he's gonna remember us?

751
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,206
I got something
that'll jog his memory.

752
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:55,627
Don't do this.

753
01:09:55,629 --> 01:09:57,930
-Well, who's gonna know?
-Me.

754
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,367
Hey! Hey!

755
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:04,836

01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:13,245
Hey, verna!

Jed!

759
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,718
Elizabeth, meet verna Sawyer.

760
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:23,255
Jed's aunt. Or is it mother?

761
01:10:23,257 --> 01:10:25,357
Or maybe both.

762
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:26,959
You're too late, verna.

763
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:28,860
He's dead.

764
01:10:28,862 --> 01:10:31,897
And I know you Sawyers
all travel in packs.

765
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:33,699
So where they at? Huh?

01:10:40,474 --> 01:10:42,774
Verna, get the fuck down.

770
01:10:43,977 --> 01:10:45,477
Get in!

771
01:10:47,981 --> 01:10:49,781
All right, well, maybe
I'll just get on a roll.

772
01:10:49,783 --> 01:10:51,783
Kill every goddamn Sawyer

Pull him out!
Come on, we got ya!
We got ya, jed.

779
01:12:37,423 --> 01:12:40,659
This'll hold it all together
till you're all healed up.

780
01:12:42,962 --> 01:12:46,798
Okay, you're gonna feel it.
I'm gonna tug it real hard.

781
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:49,901
Almost at the end here.

782
01:12:55,074 --> 01:12:56,508
Okay.

783
01:13:01,881 --> 01:13:03,749
Oh, jed.

What were you
gonna do with me?

790
01:14:04,477 --> 01:14:06,044
I don't know.

791
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:13,051
But I'm sorry.

792
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,620
I am.

793
01:14:24,764 --> 01:14:26,798
Jesus Christ.

794
01:14:28,634 --> 01:14:30,469
Oh, god, let's go.

795
01:14:42,114 --> 01:14:43,815
<i> Nubbins, get over here.</i>

796

All right.
Let's go.

802
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:39,871
You messed with
the wrong family.

803
01:15:39,873 --> 01:15:42,874
Yeah, you're proud of
this goddamn family, huh?

804
01:15:42,876 --> 01:15:44,743
Jed?

805
01:15:46,979 --> 01:15:48,880

What are you gonna do?

809
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:12,037
Huh?

810
01:16:22,748 --> 01:16:24,983
This ain't over, boy.

This ain't fuckin' over,

812
01:16:29,122 --> 01:16:31,823
Jed? What did I tell you
about outsiders?

813
01:16:31,825 --> 01:16:33,858
They fill your ears with lies.

814
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:36,761
You show 'em who you are, jed.

815
01:16:36,763 --> 01:16:39,631
Look what that man
did to your face. Huh?

816
01:16:45,037 --> 01:16:46,671
Jackson, don't do it!

817
01:16:50,644 --> 01:16:52,644
You shut up over there.
You're next, do you hear me?

818
01:16:52,646 --> 01:16:53,878
Fuck you!

819
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,747

01:17:05,225 --> 01:17:07,926
Hartman screams in agony]

822
01:18:07,887 --> 01:18:09,754
Goddamnit.

823
01:18:09,756 --> 01:18:12,023
Go, go, go, go get her, now!
Go get her!

824
01:18:12,025 --> 01:18:13,458
Whoo-hoo!

825
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:16,394
Jed, remember what I told you?
Go. Go get her.

826
01:18:16,396 --> 01:18:17,462
Get her, jed.

827
01:18:18,932 --> 01:18:20,932
Nobody messes
with our family.

828
01:19:23,062 --> 01:19:24,362
Huh?

829
01:20:10,042 --> 01:20:11,576
No!!!

830
01:20:36,036 --> 01:20:38,937
Jackson, don't do this!

831
01:20:38,939 --> 01:20:41,506
Please, don't do this.

832
01:20:41,508 --> 01:20:43,842
I tried to help you.

833
01:20:43,844 --> 01:20:46,110
That's all I ever tried to do.

834
01:20:46,112 --> 01:20:48,479
You know that, right?

835
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:51,349
Listen to me.
It's not too late.

836
01:20:51,351 --> 01:20:53,151
We can still
get out of here
together.

837
01:20:53,153 --> 01:20:55,587
That bitch is a liar, jed.

838
01:20:55,589 --> 01:20:57,522
She doesn't care about you.

839
01:20:57,524 --> 01:20:59,624
Kill her. Kill her now.

840
01:20:59,626 --> 01:21:02,393

listen to her.

841
01:21:02,395 --> 01:21:03,928
Please.

I know there's good in you.

843
01:21:06,066 --> 01:21:07,465
I've seen it.

844
01:21:07,467 --> 01:21:09,500
Please listen to me.

845
01:21:09,502 --> 01:21:12,370
This isn't you, Jackson.

846
01:21:12,372 --> 01:21:14,038
This isn't you.

847
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,507
It's your crazy mother!
It's your crazy--

848
01:21:33,092 --> 01:21:35,126
that's my boy.

849
