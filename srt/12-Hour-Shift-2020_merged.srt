2
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:42,842
It was a long
one today, I'll tell you that.

3
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:44,508
Mm.

4
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,842
There's cake in the break room.

5
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:49,408
Somebody's birthday,
I don't remember who.

6
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,909
It's just one of them
sheet cakes from Kroger,

7
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,276
but, it's pretty good
for a grocery store cake.

8
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:58,042
You don't really look like
you eat cake, though, do you?

9
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,775
- I eat cake.
- Mm.

10
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:04,876
You know, my mama always said,
"Never trust a skinny woman.

11
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:07,076
While we're eating,
they're plotting."

12
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:10,343
Well, if you eat cake,
how do you stay so little?

13
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:12,575
You are skin and bones, girl.

14
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:16,276
Smoking?

15
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,976
Mm-mm, smoking
don't make you thin. I smoke.

16
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:26,276
You know, I never know
if someone being quiet

17
00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:28,609
is a sign of ain't got
nothing to say,

18
00:01:28,742 --> 00:01:31,375
or they ain't got
nothing going on up here.

19
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:35,475
You seem to have it
altogether, though.

20
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,343
- Money-wise, I mean.
- How do you know that?

21
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:41,442
'Cause you come in here
wearing some nice shoes.

22
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:43,276
I've seen you wearing
those Candies.

23
00:01:43,408 --> 00:01:44,575
Those aren't cheap.

24
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:48,142
Well.

25
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,076
Have a good shift, Mandy.

26
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:55,542
Hey, Cathy.

27
00:01:56,243 --> 00:01:57,142
Yeah?

28
00:01:57,809 --> 00:01:58,842
Go fuck yourself.

29
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:18,675
<i>Oh, you're here.</i>

30
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:20,709
Okay, I'm very dizzy, okay?

31
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:22,508
And I spoke to Karen,
she's not listening to me.

32
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,109
I need to talk to a doctor
right away.

33
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:25,775
What if I fall down
and break a hip?

34
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:27,642
What if I fall down
and I crack my head

35
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:30,343
- and get a staph infection?
- Did you check in at this desk?

36
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,343
Yes.

37
00:02:31,475 --> 00:02:32,909
- Mr. Kent...
- Karen.

38
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,176
I told you we will call you
when we have a bed ready.

39
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:38,876
You need to sit down.

40
00:02:40,142 --> 00:02:42,209
You know, it is hot in here,
so I'm gonna wait outside

41
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:45,009
until you're ready.
And it better not rain.

42
00:02:47,276 --> 00:02:48,742
I don't like to be wet.

43
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,309
You starting now?

44
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:55,343
You should know,
you scheduled me.

45
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,109
- Oh, yes.
- I'm about to work a double.

46
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:01,575
Well, you may wanna
start with 202.

47
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:04,475
And you should probably go
and get a soda.

48
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:07,876
I don't drink soda.
Karen, you know that.

49
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:09,809
You got about 30 minutes.

50
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,909
Chug it, chug it, chug.

51
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:30,343
This is good to go.

52
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:35,508
Can you believe our insides
look like this?

53
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:37,976
Like, that's our guts.

54
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:40,909
Seems to me like it would
all just come

55
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:42,842
bubbling out of us sometimes.

56
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:46,876
Like, "Oops, my pancreas
just fell out."

57
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:48,375
Regina.

58
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:52,176
- Hmm?
- Give me the money.

59
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:54,976
Okay, but first, uh...

60
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:58,909
let me show you something.
This is what I like to do.

61
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:08,176
I like to use the soda
to keep 'em extra cold in here.

62
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,042
I always say, "Keeping it cool
is the key to my job."

63
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:14,142
I made that up.

64
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:16,343
And then I can drink 'em
when I'm done,

65
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:17,909
like it's a celebration.

66
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:22,209
- I really don't care, Regina.
- Look, we're family, right?

67
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:25,675
I mean, how many cousins
your age you got?

68
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:27,842
- Cousins by marriage.
- Right.

69
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:29,809
And who knew we're into
the same stuff?

70
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:32,042
You know,
the blood and organs and...

71
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,642
We're not. The money, Regina.

72
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:38,042
'Cause Nicholas needs
a kidney, like, right now.

73
00:05:38,243 --> 00:05:39,742
But I got held up.

74
00:05:40,343 --> 00:05:41,276
You know Wayne?

75
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,809
He... he needed help
with his science homework.

76
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:46,609
You know they teach
evolution in fifth grade now?

77
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:49,642
- In public school?
- Regina!

78
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,109
Ah. Sorry.

79
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,709
Now, was there a kidney,
in that sack?

80
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:56,876
Was there?

81
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:59,309
I know what a damn kidney
looks like.

82
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,375
Like a bean? Kidney bean?

83
00:06:03,076 --> 00:06:05,442
Jesus. Grumpy ass bitch.

84
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,009
Hey, bitch!

85
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:28,609
Fuck your mom, asshole.

86
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:00,076
Are you my mother's nurse?

87
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:03,842
Was it you who told me that
she was possibly in a coma?

88
00:07:05,109 --> 00:07:06,375
Were you here earlier?

89
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,408
I just got here.

90
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:10,309
Okay.

91
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:13,475
Any idea when the results
will be back from her tests?

92
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:15,942
The doctor won't be back
until tomorrow

93
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:19,775
- to go over test results.
- But are the test results here?

94
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:23,575
I... don't see them here, ma'am.

95
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:26,109
So am I just supposed
to stay here all night?

96
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:30,842
You don't have to.

97
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,508
I'm sorry.
It's just have a baby at home.

98
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:37,809
And I help run my...
my husband's business.

99
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:40,675
You know the... the Catfish King
over on South Grand?

100
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:41,575
Mm-hmm.

101
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:43,309
It's just I feel so guilty
not staying

102
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,343
in case she wakes up.
She might be confused.

103
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:47,775
She's got dementia
or Alzheimer's

104
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,842
or whatever they're calling it
these days.

105
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,575
If she doesn't know
where she is, she can be...

106
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:53,475
she can be real difficult
and she's...

107
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:55,343
she's very strong and...

108
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,842
Is that your mother's
overnight bag?

109
00:07:58,176 --> 00:07:59,609
Some of her personal things.

110
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:01,909
I grabbed real quickly.

111
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:07,475
You know, I just love
that Catfish King.

112
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,909
Mm! I love those hush puppies.

113
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:14,742
- Still pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:15,876
But don't you worry,

115
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:18,109
the good Lord will be
with your mama all night.

116
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:19,876
Promise you that.

117
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:38,508
No.

118
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:53,442
Ain't no way you're waking up.

119
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:57,042
Room 218 needs cleaning.

120
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,542
I already cleaned it.

121
00:08:58,842 --> 00:08:59,775
He pissed the bed.

122
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:03,276
He urinated a moment ago.
That's why I cleaned it.

123
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,809
Dorothy, clean the sheets.

124
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:23,375
- What is that about?
- State Pen.

125
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,408
Tried to kill himself.
He'll make it, though.

126
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:26,709
Poor thing.

127
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:28,609
They gotta leave him
handcuffed to the bed

128
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:29,742
even though he's passed out?

129
00:09:29,976 --> 00:09:32,408
He murdered someone.
Don't you read the paper?

130
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,508
She only reads the Bible.

131
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,408
And those Good News bulletins
that folks leave

132
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:40,475
on your front porch
when you don't answer the door.

133
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:43,309
Okay.

134
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:45,809
Emergency dialysis.
67-year-old male.

135
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:47,976
Three times in a month.
That's you.

136
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:49,442
Mr. Collins?

137
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:52,442
Yep, but not critical,
so just prioritize.

138
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:57,243
<i>I don't like this room.</i>

139
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:59,375
You hear me?

140
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:00,976
I said I don't like it.

141
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:04,109
You can leave when you're done
with your dialysis.

142
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:08,475
Sad sweat.
That's what it smells like.

143
00:10:11,508 --> 00:10:13,042
You ever smelled sadness?

144
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:17,442
Only every day.

145
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:21,542
You know, they only gave me
three months.

146
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:24,642
Two and a half now, maybe.

147
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:28,842
I'm here half the damn time.
I do wanna go home, though.

148
00:10:31,076 --> 00:10:32,408
You turn on that TV?

149
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,109
Sure.

150
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:39,109
<i>My husband likes a clean car,</i>

151
00:10:39,243 --> 00:10:40,343
<i>what can I say?</i>

152
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:42,276
<i>Well, you know what they say</i>

153
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,775
<i>about Arkansas,
if you don't like the weather,</i>

154
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:45,842
<i>just wait a minute.</i>

155
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:47,809
<i>My grandma did always say that.</i>

156
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:49,209
<i>Mine too.</i>

157
00:10:49,343 --> 00:10:51,375
<i>Well, thanks
for the weather update, Wendy.</i>

158
00:10:51,475 --> 00:10:54,042
<i>Let's get back to the real news
of this evening.</i>

159
00:10:54,442 --> 00:10:56,343
<i>The local Eighth Grade
Science Fair.</i>

160
00:10:56,475 --> 00:10:57,842
<i>Now, these kids show
some real aptitude.</i>

161
00:10:57,976 --> 00:11:00,442
You know...

162
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:05,375
...sad thing about dying is that
the minutes really slow down.

163
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:08,442
You forgot to appreciate
all those other minutes

164
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:11,508
and all you got are these
shitty ones.

165
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:16,675
Hey, Mandy, they're bringing in
an OD, and I'm too busy.

166
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,309
They could use some extra hands.

167
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:24,942
Shit.

168
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:39,609
Hey, male, 30s.
OD'd, no identification.

169
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:41,542
Found at a motel.
Heart rate is 38.

170
00:11:41,675 --> 00:11:43,976
Respiratory rate, critical.
Administered Narcan.

171
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:46,176
What?

172
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,842
- Nothing.
- You know him?

173
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,508
Uh. Sort of.

174
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,142
Okay. He needs his whole
system flushed.

175
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:53,442
Okay.

176
00:11:54,142 --> 00:11:56,009
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

177
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,609
Oh, shit, he's having a seizure.

178
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:01,575
Code blue,
someone get a line set up.

179
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,642
Oxygen's going down, code blue.

180
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:33,408
You're late.

181
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,009
But there's nothing I like
better than cash in my hand.

182
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:46,542
There's a few things I like
a lot more than cash in my hand.

183
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,508
Me too, actually.

184
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:50,542
Or maybe not.

185
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,176
202 is too tricky.

186
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,976
I have another idea.
Mr. Collins. Dialysis.

187
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:02,076
Just gotta keep
prying eyes away.

188
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:05,076
Well, look at you
taking initiative.

189
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,575
I like my initiative too.

190
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:10,609
Well, I guess I could have
your crazy ass cousin

191
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:12,109
do another pickup tomorrow.

192
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:15,508
That girl is not my cousin.

193
00:13:17,675 --> 00:13:19,109
You better tell her that.

194
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:16,775
Regina, where the fuck
have you been?

195
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:19,475
Geez, Nick,
I told you I was running late.

196
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:21,976
I reckoned you guys
would be in here playing poker

197
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:24,475
- or whatever you do.
- Nah, I already won.

198
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,876
Yeah, that shit ended hours ago.
You...

199
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:30,709
- kept me waiting.
- Geez, sorry.

200
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:32,009
I came right here.

201
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:35,009
- Our cousin said...
- Our cousin?

202
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:39,076
No, no, you're my cousin.
She's your cousin.

203
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,109
And she's your cousin
by marriage.

204
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:45,343
Mm-hmm. And that makes her
your cousin too.

205
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:47,142
Regina,
that's not how family works.

206
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:50,375
What's happening to her?

207
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:52,209
She's getting her
belly button pierced.

208
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:53,609
Stop moving, it'll hurt less.

209
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:55,508
Uh. Mikey,
get her a drink, okay?

210
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:57,243
It don't look like
she likes it much.

211
00:15:57,408 --> 00:15:59,408
And how is that any
of your fucking business?

212
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:02,742
Mandy said one of those things
is a kidney.

213
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:04,942
"One of those things"?
You don't recognize a kidney?

214
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:07,475
Telling you, public school here
is a lot of...

215
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:10,775
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh.

216
00:16:11,408 --> 00:16:13,876
I use those to keep it
a little bit cooler.

217
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:15,243
You know, I always say,

218
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,842
"Part of my job
is to keep things cool."

219
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,009
That's sweet,
but where are my fucking organs?

220
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:22,375
Uh. Under the drinks.

221
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:24,042
No, no, there's nothing here.

222
00:16:26,076 --> 00:16:28,742
- Is this a fucking joke?
- No, no joke.

223
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:31,809
Uh. I... I don't know.
Let me check my car.

224
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:34,276
Regina, I...
I realize you're new here.

225
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,942
You've been with us,
what, a couple of weeks?

226
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:37,176
- A month.
- Okay.

227
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,276
But your sole purpose
is to bring me

228
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:40,876
the fucking organs.

229
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:42,375
I'm sure I left them in my car.

230
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:44,976
I need the fucking organs
right fucking now!

231
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:48,076
I've got a guy who needs
an organ tonight.

232
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:50,076
An important guy,
more important than...

233
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:51,675
than my cousin.

234
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:53,009
You had one job to do

235
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:55,609
and that was to bring me
the kidney from the hospital.

236
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:57,809
It's really...
it's really very simple.

237
00:16:58,076 --> 00:16:58,775
I know.

238
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:00,408
This is an emergency, Regina.

239
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:02,042
Shut up!

240
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:06,475
- I... I'll check my car.
- You do that.

241
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:08,775
And if it ain't out there,
I can think of another place

242
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:11,243
where we can find ourselves
a kidney.

243
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:14,842
Maybe that's
what you're good for.

244
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:18,375
- Parts.
- I... I'll check my car.

245
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:28,508
- Somebody get this.
- Somebody come get this.

246
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:37,408
Shit. Shit.

247
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,842
It's at the hospital.
I'll be right back.

248
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:02,542
It takes 30 minutes
to get there.

249
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:06,675
She's not back in an hour,
drag her back by the hair.

250
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:08,976
Can do.

251
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:28,042
Hey, will you turn it up?
I wanna know if it's gonna rain.

252
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:31,575
You deaf?

253
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:36,642
You know, it's Karen's birthday
next week.

254
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:38,276
You gonna pitch in for flowers?

255
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,508
We're all chipping
in three bucks.

256
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:42,508
- Probably not.
- Everybody's doing it.

257
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:46,142
When are you done
with your probation?

258
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:48,842
Bite me.

259
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:54,575
Hey, EMT Derrick said you knew
that trash OD downstairs.

260
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:55,876
Who is he?

261
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:00,575
Bitch.

262
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,475
<i>Hoppity the Bunny
is what his name is,</i>

263
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:08,442
<i>and that Beanie Baby sold
for over 500 dollars</i>

264
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:09,475
<i>right here in town.</i>

265
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,309
<i>Wow, better stock up on those.</i>

266
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:13,343
<i>Our top story this evening
is the police force</i>

267
00:19:13,508 --> 00:19:15,375
<i>Y2K Preparation Convention.</i>

268
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:17,343
<i>Looks like our whole force
is out there.</i>

269
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:18,642
<i>That and then some.</i>

270
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,709
<i>Tonight began the first night
of a three...</i>

271
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:28,909
Don't tell the next shift yet.
Maybe not Mr. Collins.

272
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:32,842
I like him.
I wanna think of someone else.

273
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:36,675
- What about that prisoner?
- He has a guard.

274
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,842
I ain't scared of that.

275
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:43,042
Well, he is gonna get the chair.

276
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:47,942
I guess that could work.

277
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:51,809
- It your birthday next week?
- Yeah.

278
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,775
They getting me
some flowers or some shit?

279
00:19:55,176 --> 00:19:57,542
- Yeah.
- That's depressing.

280
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:00,508
Okay.

281
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:21,475
- Ma'am.
- Just checking in.

282
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:27,475
- You here all night?
- Uh. Unfortunately so, ma'am.

283
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:34,942
How's he doing?

284
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,909
- You're the expert.
- Hmm.

285
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:40,609
Do you need anything?

286
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,642
- I could use a coffee.
- You know, I'm not allowed

287
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:46,842
to do that for you.

288
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:49,709
But I could watch him
for a while if you wanna go

289
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:50,909
grab one. Go on.

290
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:53,076
They don't... they don't want me
to leave his side.

291
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,042
Oh, he is not going anywhere.

292
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:59,109
Yeah.

293
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Thanks, but, rules are rules.
Get me some goddamn drugs.

294
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,709
I'll see if I can get you
that coffee.

295
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:33,609
How you feeling today?

296
00:21:43,142 --> 00:21:44,842
- Did you find that coffee?
- Nope.

297
00:21:55,976 --> 00:21:59,775
We made a mistake.

298
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:02,375
What the fuck
are you doing here?

299
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:05,675
- Whoa, is that Andrew?
- What mistake?

300
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:06,976
He OD?

301
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:08,976
What's it about this family
that makes you guys

302
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:12,809
all into junkies, huh?
Must be your daddy or something.

303
00:22:18,243 --> 00:22:19,343
Is Andrew gonna die?

304
00:22:19,475 --> 00:22:21,276
- I never liked...
- There is a reason

305
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:24,209
we meet down
by the soda machine, Regina.

306
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:25,475
You can't be seen here.

307
00:22:25,675 --> 00:22:27,343
I didn't want
to come in here, okay?

308
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:29,709
You know, surrounded
by all these dying people.

309
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:33,742
This is how you get one of those
flesh-eating bacteria diseases

310
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:34,809
like they got on TV.

311
00:22:35,142 --> 00:22:37,408
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, you think it's an itch?

312
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:39,508
And...
and then you scratch it...

313
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:42,142
and your whole face
comes right off.

314
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,675
And it always begins
in a hospital.

315
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:48,142
- Why are you here?
- We fucked up.

316
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:51,842
- Shit.
- Told you that it wasn't here.

317
00:22:52,176 --> 00:22:53,375
Well, where the hell is it?

318
00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:54,809
I don't know.

319
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,176
I don't know,
I... I don't know. I... I...

320
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,976
Maybe you lost it
on the way there.

321
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:01,775
I didn't touch the cooler
between here and the warehouse.

322
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:04,609
I checked my car.
I checked everywhere.

323
00:23:04,742 --> 00:23:08,642
Look, if it's not here,
there is nothing I can do.

324
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:10,942
- We are laying low.
- Look...

325
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:12,942
I'm a little bit desperate here.

326
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:16,375
Nicholas is gonna have my ass
if I don't bring him a kidney.

327
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:19,809
Maybe more than my ass. He...
he is gonna take my kidney.

328
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:23,375
He said so. How many...
how many do I need to live?

329
00:23:23,642 --> 00:23:26,243
- One.
- How many was I born with?

330
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:28,842
- Two.
- That's not too bad.

331
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:30,642
Look... Mm-mm.

332
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:35,775
I don't wanna point
fingers at you.

333
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:38,976
It's your job to make sure
I get the package securely.

334
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:41,909
And apparently, I didn't.
Just help me out.

335
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:42,742
Regina.

336
00:23:42,942 --> 00:23:44,842
Why, just explain it to me.

337
00:23:44,976 --> 00:23:48,609
- How do you murder people?
- I don't murder them.

338
00:23:48,876 --> 00:23:50,775
It's killing someone.

339
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:53,508
That's murder,
whatever you do to them.

340
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:55,542
I don't know what you do,
but how... how do you do it?

341
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:58,742
- Mandy, just tell me. Come on.
- Bleach.

342
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:03,642
- I use bleach.
- Hmm. And then you wait?

343
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:07,142
Someone else does the removals
on the next shift.

344
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:08,675
I don't even know who.

345
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:10,742
Maybe you know
how to do it right.

346
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:14,909
You went to school, you know...
you know what thing sits where,

347
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:17,609
- whatever it sits in there.
- Yes, I know how to do it.

348
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:20,109
So you could do it all,
you could do it real fast.

349
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:24,842
- Like, all in one night.
- No. It's too hard.

350
00:24:25,442 --> 00:24:28,343
- Uh-huh.
- Mandy, help me, please?

351
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:29,775
I'm fucked.

352
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:33,609
Regina, you lost thousands
of dollars worth of organs.

353
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:37,475
- What about Andrew?
- What about Andrew?

354
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:40,675
I mean, is he gonna
make it outta here alive?

355
00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:42,742
- Yeah.
- Really?

356
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:44,142
He didn't look too good.

357
00:24:45,842 --> 00:24:48,508
You never really liked him,
right?

358
00:24:49,176 --> 00:24:52,675
I... I know he's family too,
but...

359
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:54,976
not like you and me.

360
00:24:55,343 --> 00:24:57,109
I never did like him

361
00:24:57,442 --> 00:24:59,942
when it all came out
that he did that...

362
00:25:00,508 --> 00:25:03,343
that awful stuff
to you when you was kids...

363
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:04,809
Shut it.

364
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:09,876
Don't you dare go in that room.
Get the fuck out of here.

365
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:11,442
Do you understand me?

366
00:25:14,742 --> 00:25:17,442
You are gonna have to solve
this problem by yourself.

367
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:19,142
Yes.

368
00:25:19,276 --> 00:25:21,475
Mandy?

369
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:25,243
Is it 'cause I said
all that stuff, about Andrew...

370
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:27,876
about your fucked up childhood?

371
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,775
Well, look at you.

372
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:22,842
Mm-hmm.

373
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,542
How dead are you?

374
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,575
<i>This is Wendy with the weather.</i>

375
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,508
<i>That big storm looks like
it's coming in tonight.</i>

376
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:55,942
<i>Straight from the north
and hitting us right here</i>

377
00:26:56,076 --> 00:26:59,976
<i>in Northeast Arkansas,
and it is gonna be a wet one.</i>

378
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,142
<i>Tune in here
for flash flood warnings.</i>

379
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:03,142
<i>Remember the basics.</i>

380
00:27:03,408 --> 00:27:05,475
- Close the windows to your car?
- Why?

381
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,475
It's gonna rain.

382
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:10,909
I don't leave the windows
to my car open.

383
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:12,276
Then they're closed.

384
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:15,209
<i>High humidity of 87 today.</i>

385
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:16,809
Get that package out all right?

386
00:27:18,176 --> 00:27:19,375
Yep.

387
00:27:20,276 --> 00:27:22,642
And the other?

388
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:24,609
I'll keep you updated.

389
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:27,575
<i>Next week,
we got another hot one for you.</i>

390
00:27:28,243 --> 00:27:31,176
- This is a nasty ass cake.
- Yeah.

391
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:32,809
They always get...

392
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:34,942
gross cake.

393
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:37,575
<i>Stay tuned</i>
<i>next for</i> American Life.

394
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:51,542
Oh.

395
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:53,375
Thank you.

396
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,675
Guess I fell asleep.

397
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:03,442
It's easy to get
tired on these night shifts.

398
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:04,709
Mm.

399
00:28:09,642 --> 00:28:14,042
- You, uh, work for the prison?
- Nah, I'm just hired security.

400
00:28:14,775 --> 00:28:16,042
They don't even give me a gun.

401
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:19,209
I mean, not that...

402
00:28:19,675 --> 00:28:21,076
not that I need one.

403
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,009
I do parties.

404
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:31,542
And nightclubs too.
And sometimes, I do the...

405
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:34,309
do the show circuit,
the stadium shows.

406
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:35,942
I just did a Marilyn Manson...

407
00:28:36,942 --> 00:28:38,076
show. Do you like them?

408
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,842
- Mm. No.
- No, yeah. Just a bunch of...

409
00:28:43,176 --> 00:28:44,609
long-haired
vampire-looking kids,

410
00:28:44,742 --> 00:28:46,209
but it was... it was cool.

411
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:49,475
Yeah, that guitarist used to be
on <i>The Wonder Years.</i>

412
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:51,276
Yeah, he got one of his ribs
taken out

413
00:28:51,408 --> 00:28:54,675
so he could suck his own dick.
Yeah.

414
00:28:55,675 --> 00:28:56,675
Uh...

415
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:03,176
Hey.

416
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,909
- Hi!
- You here for his blood work?

417
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,142
Uh-huh, yep, mm-hmm.

418
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:08,508
He's probably gonna be
a vegetable.

419
00:29:08,742 --> 00:29:10,475
It's a waste, he's pretty cute.

420
00:29:10,642 --> 00:29:12,675
Maybe he's an asshole
in real life.

421
00:29:13,076 --> 00:29:14,176
Cute ones always are.

422
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:17,809
Excuse me.
Could you direct me to room 222?

423
00:29:17,942 --> 00:29:18,942
I keep getting lost.

424
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:23,142
I'm busy.

425
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:27,109
- It's just around the corner.
- Well, I can't seem to find it.

426
00:29:28,276 --> 00:29:29,442
Then I guess...

427
00:29:30,176 --> 00:29:31,408
I'll show you.

428
00:29:32,076 --> 00:29:33,076
You will.

429
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:43,009
Just keep going.
It's on this floor.

430
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:52,276
- You are not very helpful.
- I'm busy, can't you see that?

431
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:54,475
Well, I need to know
where I'm going...

432
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:57,176
I'm like the other nurse.
You know, I'm also busy.

433
00:29:57,343 --> 00:29:58,508
This is my patient.

434
00:29:58,742 --> 00:30:03,475
Mrs. Eliza Patrick.
And Mrs. Patrick needs me.

435
00:30:03,642 --> 00:30:04,909
Who is your supervisor?

436
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:06,909
I'm sorry, I don't have time
to talk to you.

437
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:08,442
Who is your supervisor?

438
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:10,542
I want to tell them about
your poor customer service.

439
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,442
You're the one
who can't find her way around

440
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:14,243
one story of a building.

441
00:30:14,475 --> 00:30:16,109
I'm gonna tell
everyone about that.

442
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:18,343
Are you my nurse?

443
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:21,442
- Yes, ma'am, I am.
- I need to get up for a bit.

444
00:30:21,575 --> 00:30:23,742
Nah. I think that's a bad idea.

445
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:25,309
<i>Nurse!</i>

446
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:28,542
- <i>Can I get a nurse in here?</i>
- Where are you going?

447
00:30:28,775 --> 00:30:30,142
To help this screaming man.

448
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:31,876
- <i>Nurse?</i>
- What is your name?

449
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:32,942
Mandy.

450
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:36,142
Well, I'm gonna report you,
Mandy!

451
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:42,209
I think I must be done.

452
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:47,508
- Been here for over two hours.
- Probably so, then.

453
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:52,675
What's happening to you in here?

454
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:53,775
What?

455
00:30:55,742 --> 00:30:58,176
Dialysis.

456
00:30:58,675 --> 00:31:01,809
- Are you a nurse or what?
- Obviously.

457
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:04,876
Look at my outfit.

458
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:06,909
Could you turn that TV up?

459
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:08,375
Can't hear anything.

460
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:13,909
What happened?

461
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:17,408
She tried to stand.
I saw her from the hallway.

462
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,309
I didn't think she'd wake up.

463
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:22,076
- She's stronger than she looks.
- Mrs. Patrick?

464
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:23,675
Your daughter just stepped out.

465
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:25,809
We need to get you
back in the bed, okay?

466
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:26,809
Where is she?

467
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,742
Call her daughter, please,
and tell her she's awake.

468
00:31:30,142 --> 00:31:31,076
Come on now.

469
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,009
- That's right.
- Up we go.

470
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:41,475
Where is Shawna?

471
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:46,209
Mrs. Patrick. Eliza.
Listen to me, okay?

472
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:48,009
We're here to take care of you.

473
00:31:52,742 --> 00:31:54,775
- Stay here a minute, will you?
- Okay.

474
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:11,709
Shit.

475
00:32:14,942 --> 00:32:16,009
What the fuck?

476
00:32:16,742 --> 00:32:19,675
- It's bleach.
- Oh, my sweet Jesus.

477
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:20,976
Did you say bleach?

478
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:23,675
- Mr. Collins?
- He's gone.

479
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,942
Oh, no! Oh!

480
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:29,542
What the fuck happened to him?

481
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:31,442
- I don't know.
- Have you lost your damn mind?

482
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:32,642
I can't cover
something like this.

483
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:34,976
- No. Dammit. It wasn't me.
- You sure?

484
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:36,475
Yes.

485
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:38,909
- Somebody call the cops?
- Yep.

486
00:32:39,243 --> 00:32:40,408
Damn!

487
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:46,609
- You going home?
- They told me to wait

488
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:47,876
and give a statement.

489
00:32:48,742 --> 00:32:52,408
- We are fucked.
- I know, Karen.

490
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:58,642
This is gonna set us way back.

491
00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:00,309
We can't do anything
for weeks now.

492
00:33:00,742 --> 00:33:03,408
Do you think I don't fucking
know that, Karen? Damn.

493
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:05,109
Well, if you didn't do it,
who did?

494
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:09,176
You know,
he was really depressed.

495
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:11,142
Ain't nobody drinking bleach,
Mandy.

496
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:15,142
Then I don't know.

497
00:33:16,408 --> 00:33:17,909
Is there any more cake?

498
00:33:20,076 --> 00:33:21,508
- What?
- Oh, my God.

499
00:33:22,142 --> 00:33:23,375
Wha...

500
00:33:24,508 --> 00:33:25,942
Oh, good.

501
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:38,742
Oh, goddammit. What the fuck
are you doing here?

502
00:33:38,876 --> 00:33:40,775
Why are you wearing that?

503
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,343
This is not funny, Regina.

504
00:33:42,475 --> 00:33:43,942
You need to get
the fuck outta here.

505
00:33:44,076 --> 00:33:45,343
We just had an a...

506
00:33:49,942 --> 00:33:51,009
What did you do?

507
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:57,642
- Uh... Well, I was...
- What the hell did you do?

508
00:33:58,176 --> 00:34:00,375
Nothing,
I was just helping you out.

509
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:05,909
Did you pour bleach
down that man's throat?

510
00:34:07,176 --> 00:34:08,408
Yeah.

511
00:34:09,076 --> 00:34:11,009
I just did what you do.

512
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:14,575
- That is not what I do.
- Hmm?

513
00:34:15,642 --> 00:34:19,076
Why, I need that man's kidney.
I need it tonight.

514
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:21,309
Just give it to me
and I'll leave.

515
00:34:21,742 --> 00:34:23,309
I'll go, you won't ever see
me again.

516
00:34:23,442 --> 00:34:24,609
Oh, my God.

517
00:34:27,508 --> 00:34:28,809
You're so stupid.

518
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:33,675
You are such a stupid bitch.

519
00:34:34,343 --> 00:34:35,442
Excuse me?

520
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:39,408
- Fuck you.
- You are so dumb.

521
00:34:40,675 --> 00:34:42,809
Do you know what dialysis is?

522
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,176
Mr. Collins was on dialysis

523
00:34:45,343 --> 00:34:47,243
because his kidneys
are so shitty

524
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,942
he can't flush out
his own system.

525
00:34:49,076 --> 00:34:52,109
So even if I was stupid enough
to help you,

526
00:34:52,442 --> 00:34:54,243
that man's kidneys are useless.

527
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,709
You killed an innocent man
for no reason.

528
00:34:58,209 --> 00:34:59,642
Do you understand that?

529
00:35:02,675 --> 00:35:04,909
I'm not leaving
till you give me a kidney.

530
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:06,742
You are gonna leave.

531
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:09,009
And you are gonna leave
right now.

532
00:35:09,876 --> 00:35:13,076
The cops are coming here.
And when they get here,

533
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:15,876
I'm gonna tell them
who did this shit,

534
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:18,209
the girl posing as a nurse

535
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:21,076
standing in the storage room
like an idiot.

536
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:23,909
You wouldn't turn on me
like that.

537
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:26,009
You brought me
into this whole thing.

538
00:35:26,976 --> 00:35:28,609
Oh, like hell I wouldn't.

539
00:35:29,442 --> 00:35:31,542
Then I'll tell them everything.

540
00:35:32,176 --> 00:35:34,375
All the bad stuff about you...

541
00:35:35,408 --> 00:35:37,009
about your little operation.

542
00:35:37,709 --> 00:35:40,408
Hell, about all the drugs
you do in here.

543
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:46,542
If I leave here
without a kidney...

544
00:35:47,343 --> 00:35:48,508
I'm dead.

545
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:10,609
What happened to this guy?

546
00:36:10,942 --> 00:36:12,076
Alcohol and morphine.

547
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:14,809
- Is he dead?
- No.

548
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:17,408
Whoa.

549
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,976
Is this, like, a prisoner
or something?

550
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:21,408
Mm, he's perfect.

551
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:23,309
Just bleach him
and take his kidney.

552
00:36:23,742 --> 00:36:26,575
Probably deserves it.
What did he do?

553
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:28,375
Haven't you heard?

554
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:31,742
Murder. I murdered a cop.

555
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:33,475
I hate cops...

556
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:36,542
but I love blondes.

557
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:42,542
- We didn't know you were awake.
- Come on.

558
00:36:42,775 --> 00:36:46,642
Take one of my kidneys,
and I'll take one of yours.

559
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,942
Fuck.

560
00:36:48,575 --> 00:36:50,109
Hey, you ever do it
on someone who's awake?

561
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:51,742
I... I mean,
he could still work.

562
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,709
No, stop trying to help.

563
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:56,542
Give me an hour, wait outside.

564
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:58,709
Okay, fine,
but we have to hurry.

565
00:36:58,942 --> 00:36:59,976
An hour.

566
00:37:21,642 --> 00:37:23,775
Lucky you got family checks
on you.

567
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:46,609
I could've used this tonight.
Hope you enjoy it.

568
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:03,375
Mandy, you're next.
He needs a statement.

569
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:05,842
- I was just, uh...
- Mandy, wait right there.

570
00:38:05,942 --> 00:38:06,642
It'll just be a minute.

571
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:08,709
Ma'am, would you mind
closing the door?

572
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:09,976
Okay. Sit.

573
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:14,775
Hour's up.

574
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:26,976
Fuck you.

575
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:39,575
Mikey. Shit.

576
00:38:48,343 --> 00:38:51,642
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

577
00:38:52,243 --> 00:38:54,675
No one else in the unit
at the time that you know of?

578
00:38:54,942 --> 00:38:55,809
- No.
- No, sir.

579
00:38:56,142 --> 00:39:00,575
Nothing strange to report
when you saw Mr. Collins last?

580
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:02,109
- Nope.
- No, sir.

581
00:39:02,742 --> 00:39:05,176
Although he was always
a bit surly.

582
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:07,009
We'll notify the family.

583
00:39:08,109 --> 00:39:10,675
His poor family.

584
00:39:11,442 --> 00:39:12,775
They were never around.

585
00:39:13,508 --> 00:39:14,809
Well, it doesn't make it right.

586
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:16,642
No, ma'am, it does not.

587
00:39:19,508 --> 00:39:20,442
Have a good night, officer.

588
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,343
Uh, No, I'm staying
here till morning,

589
00:39:22,508 --> 00:39:24,243
just to make sure
you ladies are safe.

590
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:26,408
Just gotta take care
of you ladies.

591
00:39:26,675 --> 00:39:28,642
I wanna keep an eye on things.

592
00:39:28,876 --> 00:39:31,675
Make sure that
no bad guys get in.

593
00:39:32,442 --> 00:39:34,042
Yeah, we got another officer
coming by to ask

594
00:39:34,176 --> 00:39:37,109
y'all some questions later.
He's like a detective, you know?

595
00:39:37,243 --> 00:39:39,109
I'm just sorta night shift.

596
00:39:39,842 --> 00:39:42,276
You know, I... I think y'all
got nothing to worry about.

597
00:39:42,475 --> 00:39:43,575
It was just
an out-of-the-ordinary

598
00:39:43,742 --> 00:39:46,809
- type situation.
- Well, you can say that again.

599
00:39:47,408 --> 00:39:48,709
It was just
an out-of-the-ordinary

600
00:39:48,842 --> 00:39:49,775
type situation.

601
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:53,909
Oh.

602
00:39:54,408 --> 00:39:55,575
I get it.

603
00:39:59,176 --> 00:40:02,243
But I'll be here, all night.

604
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:03,976
You two will be safe.

605
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:08,408
- Are we done here?
- Yes, ma'am.

606
00:40:08,642 --> 00:40:09,742
That's all my questions.

607
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:11,942
I got a lot of patients
to get to.

608
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:19,109
Karen, Karen, Karen, Karen.

609
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:21,142
Are you sure you don't have
a room for me?

610
00:40:21,276 --> 00:40:23,609
- Mr. Kent.
- Hmm?

611
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:25,909
We have to get to
the priority problems first.

612
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:27,542
I mean, look at you.
You're walking around,

613
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,343
you're standing up. I...
I don't know even know

614
00:40:29,475 --> 00:40:31,042
- what's wrong with you.
- I'm dizzy.

615
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:34,042
You don't need a room.

616
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:37,842
- Hey.
- Hey.

617
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:45,709
- You get interviewed?
- By that cute cop?

618
00:40:46,508 --> 00:40:48,742
- Yeah.
- He funny, ain't he?

619
00:40:48,876 --> 00:40:51,642
I like 'em funny, and rich.

620
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:53,442
But he ain't rich.

621
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:58,842
Mr. Kent.
Go sit down and wait your turn.

622
00:40:59,009 --> 00:41:00,109
You are nosy as hell.

623
00:41:01,343 --> 00:41:03,109
It's too stuffy in here, so.

624
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:08,243
Someone expired in the ICU.
The coroner just left.

625
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:11,142
And the body is in the morgue
waiting to be transferred.

626
00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:13,475
But I thought we agreed.

627
00:41:14,876 --> 00:41:17,675
Extenuating circumstances.
I'll explain later.

628
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,542
Well, damn, bitch,
you could've warned me.

629
00:41:20,209 --> 00:41:22,276
You know, I got a bad heart,
I can't take this shit.

630
00:41:22,442 --> 00:41:23,642
Trust me.

631
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:25,942
Trust you about as far
as I can throw you.

632
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:32,076
Mr. Kent.

633
00:41:34,142 --> 00:41:35,442
Mr. Kent?

634
00:41:36,209 --> 00:41:37,508
We have a room for you.

635
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,542
Where the hell did he go?

636
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:32,042
Shit.

637
00:42:48,976 --> 00:42:49,942
Shit.

638
00:43:02,176 --> 00:43:03,408
Shit.

639
00:43:13,775 --> 00:43:17,976
Hey. Isn't it a little late
for you to be out here skating?

640
00:43:48,243 --> 00:43:49,508
Amen.

Oh. Sorry.
Heard a noise.

655
00:45:38,408 --> 00:45:41,508
- Uh. It was me.
- Yeah.

656
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:45,542
What happened?

657
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:51,042
Man, y'all sure do get dirty,
huh?

658
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:56,542
I could not do that.

659
00:45:56,842 --> 00:45:58,408
You want some help
with this guy?

660
00:45:59,142 --> 00:46:00,076
Uh...

661
00:46:00,876 --> 00:46:01,575
Sure.

662
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,209
Sorry, I'm trying
to be a gentleman and all.

663
00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:07,809
One, two.

664
00:46:12,775 --> 00:46:15,009
You guys probably get a lot
of back issues, huh?

665
00:46:15,709 --> 00:46:16,909
Some people do.

666
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:19,408
You look like you work in a...

667
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:21,809
butcher shop.

668
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:25,209
Hey, you want a soda?

669
00:46:25,775 --> 00:46:27,675
I just got an extra one
from the machine.

670
00:46:30,243 --> 00:46:31,408
I'm good.

671
00:46:32,976 --> 00:46:35,309
No offense, uh,
this room is real creepy.

672
00:46:35,442 --> 00:46:38,775
- And smells, so.
- Uh. Yeah.

673
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:41,508
Totally.

674
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:44,442
Wow.

675
00:46:48,642 --> 00:46:50,408
Oh, sorry.

676
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,609
Probably not allowed
to touch that, huh?

677
00:46:53,842 --> 00:46:58,375
- Yeah. Better not.
- I mean, oh, okay.

678
00:46:58,508 --> 00:47:00,109
Just trying to be,
make a joke, you know?

679
00:47:00,243 --> 00:47:02,442
It's pretty disgusting.

680
00:47:02,876 --> 00:47:04,575
Not that I'm not used
to seeing...

681
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,876
disgusting things. I mean, I...

682
00:47:07,642 --> 00:47:09,442
I really am.
You'd be surprised what happens.

683
00:47:09,575 --> 00:47:11,976
This one guy, he, um,
yeah, I mean, he, uh...

684
00:47:13,942 --> 00:47:15,809
Guess I don't really have
any stories.

685
00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:18,742
You know, just stuff happens,
you know? Yeah.

686
00:47:19,209 --> 00:47:20,375
It's kinda like, you
know, like <i>Cops,</i>

687
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:23,109
- if you've ever seen that show.
- You know...

688
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:28,575
- I think I will take that soda.
- All right.

689
00:47:31,408 --> 00:47:35,775
I'm so glad you're here,
to take care of us...

690
00:47:36,442 --> 00:47:37,976
to make sure we're safe.

691
00:47:40,742 --> 00:47:42,375
Just doing my job.

692
00:47:46,142 --> 00:47:47,575
I'll let you get back to yours.

693
00:47:47,709 --> 00:47:50,575
Mm-hmm. Bye.

694
00:48:23,976 --> 00:48:24,976
Shit.

695
00:48:28,475 --> 00:48:30,575
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Dorothy?

696
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:32,842
Mandy?
I gotta go get that cute cop

697
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:36,442
'cause I swear to God, there's
a dead body over there!

698
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:39,709
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
There's another one.

699
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:42,575
- A dead body, can you hear me?
- Where?

700
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:44,408
- Huh?
- Where?

701
00:48:44,642 --> 00:48:46,709
Over by the storage shed!

702
00:48:46,775 --> 00:48:48,475
I don't know what I was...
I just went out there,

703
00:48:48,575 --> 00:48:50,542
just looking for somewhere
outta the rain to smoke.

704
00:48:50,675 --> 00:48:52,442
Oh, God, I shouldn't even
be smoking!

705
00:48:52,675 --> 00:48:54,408
And then...
and then there was a dead body!

706
00:48:54,675 --> 00:48:56,942
Do you know what that means?
Mandy!

707
00:48:57,076 --> 00:48:58,976
There is a murderer
loose in the hospital.

708
00:48:59,209 --> 00:49:02,109
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.

709
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:06,642
- We're gonna die. Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

710
00:49:20,343 --> 00:49:22,642
- So, are you a doctor?
- No, I'm a nurse.

711
00:49:22,942 --> 00:49:25,209
Now go sit down.
I'll be with you in a minute.

712
00:49:29,408 --> 00:49:32,142
- We have a problem.
- Yeah, no kidding.

713
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:34,742
Y'all found
someone to help me yet?

714
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:36,609
Nope.

715
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:38,876
Just let me know
when you do.

716
00:49:42,276 --> 00:49:43,542
Y'all... y'all stay safe.

717
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:45,976
- Okay.
- What the hell?

718
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,009
I guess we have multiple
problems.

719
00:49:49,809 --> 00:49:50,809
I need your help.

720
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:53,809
Mandy, what did you get into?

721
00:49:53,942 --> 00:49:56,375
I'm just gonna apologize
in advance.

722
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,375
<i>Wait, so this bitch
might be wearing scrubs?</i>

723
00:50:02,642 --> 00:50:05,042
She might be snorting up all
the Valium in the building,

724
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:07,076
for all I know.
She's fucking nuts.

725
00:50:07,475 --> 00:50:09,343
I don't like it when
people call women nuts.

726
00:50:09,475 --> 00:50:11,243
It's just an excuse
to belittle their problems.

727
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,243
And mental health
is nothing to belittle.

728
00:50:13,709 --> 00:50:16,076
This bitch is actually nuts.

729
00:50:16,343 --> 00:50:18,042
Say what you want,
doesn't mean I like it.

730
00:50:18,442 --> 00:50:20,176
- Excuse me, ladies?
- Not now, all right?

731
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:21,209
Fine.

732
00:50:21,343 --> 00:50:22,542
<i>So, what's your plan here?</i>

733
00:50:22,909 --> 00:50:25,309
<i>Find this crazy bitch
and get her the fuck outta here</i>

734
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:27,142
<i>before she tells on both of us.</i>

735
00:50:27,408 --> 00:50:28,475
<i>You're sure this was her?</i>

736
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:29,609
<i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

737
00:50:30,142 --> 00:50:31,976
<i>Why would you bring
this cousin of yours into this</i>

738
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:34,742
<i>if you knew she would kill
people and rat us both out?</i>

739
00:50:34,942 --> 00:50:37,542
I sometimes have
too much faith in humanity.

740
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:41,375
That is what I like about you.

741
00:50:46,142 --> 00:50:48,542
But just so you know, if either
of you get me in trouble,

742
00:50:48,675 --> 00:50:51,076
I will ask God
to strike you both down,

743
00:50:51,209 --> 00:50:52,508
'cause he listens to me.

744
00:50:58,642 --> 00:50:59,575
Shit.

745
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:11,142
Come on.

746
00:51:13,675 --> 00:51:15,343
- Ah, shit.
- We're going on a walk.

747
00:51:15,475 --> 00:51:16,442
All right.

748
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:18,408
Hey, Dr. Wilder.

749
00:51:28,909 --> 00:51:29,976
Y'all look mad.

750
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:33,142
Damn, bitch, where's your shoes?

751
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:34,809
That guy pooped on them
when he died.

752
00:51:34,909 --> 00:51:36,475
Oh, Lord, you're right,
she is a murderer.

753
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:38,042
Y'all are murderers first.

754
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:43,109
- Look, I... I can explain.
- Mm-hmm.

755
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:44,609
Yeah.

756
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:47,042
- Are those your panties?
- Yeah.

757
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:48,942
It's all I had to put
the kidney in.

758
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,508
And I didn't hear from you

759
00:51:50,709 --> 00:51:52,142
and...
and it had been over an hour...

760
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,309
I was caught up
in the mess you created.

761
00:51:54,442 --> 00:51:55,609
Well, I was all alone...

762
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:58,775
and then Mikey came and there
was a cop waiting around...

763
00:51:59,176 --> 00:52:01,775
- Did they see you?
- No, never, I was just hiding.

764
00:52:02,076 --> 00:52:03,709
And then that kid came,
so I went over there

765
00:52:03,842 --> 00:52:05,575
- and I just... I...
- ...got it.

766
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:07,475
Stop. You need to get
the fuck outta here.

767
00:52:07,609 --> 00:52:09,508
Those cops are gonna be
looking for you

768
00:52:09,642 --> 00:52:11,109
or anybody that did this shit.

769
00:52:11,276 --> 00:52:13,942
And there's some creep outside
waiting to rip your tits off.

770
00:52:14,076 --> 00:52:16,609
Well, it's fine now
'cause I have a kidney.

771
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:19,475
Now I can see Mikey.
He won't rip my tits off.

772
00:52:19,609 --> 00:52:21,909
- That ain't no kidney.
- What isn't?

773
00:52:22,475 --> 00:52:25,243
That is not a kidney.
That's a bladder.

774
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,209
- Oh, Lord Jesus.
- But how do you know that?

775
00:52:27,408 --> 00:52:29,375
I don't know if my heart
can take this right now.

776
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:31,309
I saw where you opened
that kid up.

777
00:52:31,442 --> 00:52:32,575
You didn't even go in the back.

778
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:35,042
No, my... my...
my kidneys are right here.

779
00:52:35,209 --> 00:52:37,243
Those are your ovaries.

780
00:52:37,809 --> 00:52:40,475
That is a bladder.
Damn, you're nuts!

781
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:43,009
Maybe you should think
about this shit

782
00:52:43,142 --> 00:52:44,309
before you go murdering someone.

783
00:52:44,442 --> 00:52:45,343
I hate you.

784
00:52:47,076 --> 00:52:48,909
Shit. They're coming for me.

785
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:51,276
It's just the storm.

786
00:52:51,842 --> 00:52:53,109
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

787
00:52:53,276 --> 00:52:55,876
<i>I have to inform you that we
are in a lock down situation.</i>

788
00:52:57,176 --> 00:52:58,909
Oh, that is not necessary.

789
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,876
<i>Do not exit
or enter the building.</i>

790
00:53:03,575 --> 00:53:05,109
Shit, I gotta get
the fuck outta here.

791
00:53:05,508 --> 00:53:06,876
I just, I'm gonna go run.

792
00:53:09,176 --> 00:53:11,176
- I'm just gonna run outta here.
- Stop.

793
00:53:12,508 --> 00:53:14,375
I got you a kidney,
like I said I would.

794
00:53:14,642 --> 00:53:15,675
It's down by the soda machine.

795
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:19,343
Go down there, get it,
and get the fuck outta here.

796
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:21,709
But there's cops outside.

797
00:53:22,508 --> 00:53:23,508
Karen will walk you out.

798
00:53:23,642 --> 00:53:24,876
- Mm-mm.
- And I'll distract the cops.

799
00:53:24,942 --> 00:53:26,876
I... I'm not going anywhere
with that murderer, no.

800
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:27,642
I'm pulling rank.

801
00:53:27,976 --> 00:53:29,575
All right, all right,
all right, fine.

802
00:53:31,009 --> 00:53:31,976
I will walk you out.

803
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:34,742
Will you kindly...

804
00:53:35,343 --> 00:53:37,243
distract the cops?

805
00:53:37,442 --> 00:53:39,209
Just get them
to the waiting room

806
00:53:39,343 --> 00:53:40,542
and we'll sneak out the back.

807
00:53:43,243 --> 00:53:46,542
Fuck, can't believe I'm taking
pity on your redneck ass.

808
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:49,508
Okay, give me ten minutes...

809
00:53:50,575 --> 00:53:52,176
and if I catch...

810
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:56,109
your skinny ass,
impersonating a nurse again,

811
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:58,508
I will rip your bladder out.

812
00:53:58,775 --> 00:54:01,542
- Okay. Thank you.
- She said, "Thank you."

813
00:54:02,775 --> 00:54:04,909
- Ten minutes.
- Yeah, ten minutes.

814
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,909
We're just gonna wait here
for a minute.

815
00:54:10,575 --> 00:54:13,809
<i>Hospital,
code red. Shelter in place.</i>

816
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,542
Um...

817
00:54:20,475 --> 00:54:21,508
Let's go to the nurse's station.

818
00:54:21,609 --> 00:54:22,842
We're gonna go
to the nurse's station.

819
00:54:22,976 --> 00:54:25,009
Why do we have to go
to the nurse's station?

820
00:54:25,709 --> 00:54:27,508
- We just have to.
- Why?

821
00:54:28,076 --> 00:54:29,142
People are there.

822
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:39,842
Throw that away.

823
00:54:42,408 --> 00:54:43,609
<i>Hospital, code red.</i>

824
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:45,842
- You look sweaty.
- Shut up, let's go.

825
00:54:46,042 --> 00:54:47,009
Wait.

826
00:54:48,709 --> 00:54:51,109
- I just wanna go home.
- It's late

827
00:54:51,243 --> 00:54:52,542
and I can't get a hold
of anyone.

828
00:54:52,775 --> 00:54:54,109
Well, then I'm going on a break.

829
00:54:54,276 --> 00:54:57,475
We don't have time for you
to take a break, Dorothy.

830
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:02,243
Mandy, I need you out front.
Someone needs to be out there

831
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:03,508
to keep the public
from getting in.

832
00:55:03,642 --> 00:55:06,609
It's like no one understands
what lockdown means.

833
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:09,909
I was just, um...
I was just going out

834
00:55:10,042 --> 00:55:11,976
- for a smoke break.
- Is that a joke?

835
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,909
And you, little missy, need to
get back to your own floor.

836
00:55:15,209 --> 00:55:16,243
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.

837
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:18,742
- I'll take her.
- Why would you need to do that?

838
00:55:19,343 --> 00:55:20,508
Dammit, Mandy.

839
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:24,009
There is too much going on.
Just go before I write you up.

840
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:27,642
It's just been a long night.

841
00:55:28,142 --> 00:55:33,009
For everyone. It's been
a long night for everyone.

842
00:55:33,642 --> 00:55:34,375
Go.

843
00:55:34,876 --> 00:55:36,375
<i>Hospital,
code red. Shelter in place.</i>

844
00:55:36,442 --> 00:55:37,675
Double go.

845
00:56:31,609 --> 00:56:33,675
- Hey, you can't be back here.
- Help.

846
00:56:34,243 --> 00:56:35,876
Help, really scary guy...

847
00:56:36,009 --> 00:56:37,142
...in the waiting room.

848
00:56:37,508 --> 00:56:39,542
Probably the murderer
that you're looking for.

849
00:56:40,142 --> 00:56:41,542
Huge, very huge, hulking.

850
00:56:41,942 --> 00:56:44,408
- Okay, you stay here...
- Nope, no, no, no.

851
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:46,243
Definitely both of you
'cause...

852
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:49,142
...he's huge.
So can you just, like...

853
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:52,042
Yes, waiting room.

854
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:02,475
Oh, it's you.

855
00:57:03,009 --> 00:57:04,809
Finally, I... I was calling
about my mother.

856
00:57:18,675 --> 00:57:20,742
What can I do for you?

857
00:57:22,642 --> 00:57:25,142
Oh, hi, we're on lock down.
You can't be on this floor.

858
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,675
Uh. Excuse me, who are you?

859
00:57:30,642 --> 00:57:31,609
Hello?

860
00:57:32,276 --> 00:57:33,475
Excuse me!

861
00:57:34,276 --> 00:57:35,909
We are on lockdown!

862
00:57:37,942 --> 00:57:39,942
Did...
did you speak to my daughter?

863
00:57:40,142 --> 00:57:41,343
- What?
- You said you were gonna

864
00:57:41,475 --> 00:57:43,475
- get her back up here.
- That... that was someone else.

865
00:57:43,642 --> 00:57:45,876
My daughter needs
to know that I'm sick.

866
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:49,176
That's the reason
I'm in this fancy hotel.

867
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:51,243
Uh. Wha... wha...
what kind of sick?

868
00:57:51,442 --> 00:57:53,809
I feel nauseated.
Can I get a warm towel?

869
00:57:53,942 --> 00:57:56,976
- I'll get a nurse.
- You look like a nurse.

870
00:57:58,343 --> 00:57:59,276
Who are you?

871
00:57:59,475 --> 00:58:01,042
You are not supposed to be
in here.

872
00:58:02,542 --> 00:58:04,442
- I'm a new nurse.
- In what unit?

873
00:58:04,675 --> 00:58:08,076
- Uh. Today's my first day.
- Where do you work?

874
00:58:09,309 --> 00:58:11,842
Third floor.
I just came down here

875
00:58:11,976 --> 00:58:14,909
'cause, uh, I know this...
this woman.

876
00:58:15,076 --> 00:58:16,042
Does she know you?

877
00:58:16,675 --> 00:58:20,508
She's sick. Obviously.
Doesn't remember a damn thing,

878
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:24,009
but we are such good...

879
00:58:24,675 --> 00:58:28,408
- friends from church.
- I do go to church.

880
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:32,408
Well, what... is her name?

881
00:58:33,508 --> 00:58:36,909
Uh. Patrick. Uh. Mrs. Patrick.

882
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:39,276
That's my married name.

883
00:58:39,508 --> 00:58:41,809
Okay. Fine. Sorry, Mrs. Patrick.

884
00:58:42,475 --> 00:58:44,942
I didn't realize that you
were such good friends.

885
00:58:45,176 --> 00:58:46,276
You know we're on a lockdown?

886
00:58:46,675 --> 00:58:48,408
You're not supposed
to leave your floor.

887
00:58:49,042 --> 00:58:49,775
Really?

888
00:58:49,909 --> 00:58:51,309
There was a dead body.

889
00:58:51,475 --> 00:58:54,508
I found it. I was smoking,
please don't tell.

890
00:58:55,309 --> 00:58:56,343
You need to go back upstairs.

891
00:58:56,475 --> 00:58:57,675
Did they not announce
it up on third?

892
00:58:57,809 --> 00:58:59,609
- No, no, no.
- Yes, they did.

893
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:02,609
You gotta get back up there.
Where are your shoes?

894
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:04,775
Uh...

895
00:59:11,142 --> 00:59:14,109
- Help me!
- No, no.

896
00:59:14,243 --> 00:59:16,508
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no.

897
00:59:18,675 --> 00:59:20,642
I threw up.

898
00:59:21,276 --> 00:59:23,475
Can you get that
warm towel for me?

899
00:59:28,876 --> 00:59:31,542
You better not have
given me a disease.

900
00:59:34,609 --> 00:59:37,009
Dammit. Goddammit.

901
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:40,375
You're strong.

902
00:59:43,209 --> 00:59:45,642
Dammit! Dammit!

903
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,675
Ma'am, are you okay?

904
00:59:51,243 --> 00:59:53,475
Help me! Help us!

905
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:58,442
Hey, girl. Are you new?

906
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:18,243
Where do you think
you're going?

907
01:00:18,976 --> 01:00:20,675
Just heading back
to the third floor.

908
01:00:20,809 --> 01:00:22,842
No, ma'am. No elevators
'cause of lock down.

909
01:00:22,976 --> 01:00:25,508
- You gotta take the stairs.
- Mm. Okay.

910
01:00:26,642 --> 01:00:28,408
And make sure
that someone from your floor

911
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:29,642
comes down to assist the cops.

912
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,542
- Sure.
- We can't do everything.

913
01:00:31,909 --> 01:00:32,942
Yep, thanks.

914
01:00:37,442 --> 01:00:38,508
Could you tell if he was armed?

915
01:00:38,742 --> 01:00:40,742
I don't know, don't murderers
always have weapons?

916
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:48,709
Well, I... I mean, he was...
he was here just a minute ago.

917
01:00:48,842 --> 01:00:50,508
Uh. And like I said,
he was really, really...

918
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:51,742
He was really horrible-looking.

919
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:53,809
- Maybe he left.
- Or... or maybe he went back

920
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,408
into the hospital
and murder more people.

921
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:58,742
Murder people? What is going on?
Are we in danger here?

922
01:00:58,876 --> 01:01:01,309
No, ma'am, everything is fine.
Just remain calm.

923
01:01:01,442 --> 01:01:03,042
Well, I need to know
what's going on.

924
01:01:03,408 --> 01:01:05,942
- I'm going. Good luck.
- Okay, good luck to you.

925
01:01:16,942 --> 01:01:17,976
Well, hello.

926
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:19,842
Wow.

927
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:22,276
You look fucking gross, Regina.

928
01:01:22,909 --> 01:01:25,009
You know, I've been...

929
01:01:25,142 --> 01:01:26,809
I've been looking for you,
skanky.

930
01:01:27,742 --> 01:01:28,675
Good.

931
01:01:29,408 --> 01:01:31,309
I was looking for you too.

932
01:01:31,442 --> 01:01:33,442
Hmm, you know,
I'm supposed to drag you back

933
01:01:33,575 --> 01:01:34,842
to Nicholas by your hair.

934
01:01:34,942 --> 01:01:37,109
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

935
01:01:37,243 --> 01:01:40,009
Now, I've got legs.
I can just walk.

936
01:01:40,408 --> 01:01:43,042
Don't you want a damn kidney?

937
01:01:43,309 --> 01:01:44,976
Oh, it's a little late for that.

938
01:01:45,842 --> 01:01:46,742
Look...

939
01:01:47,343 --> 01:01:50,276
it's not my fault.
My stupid cousin...

940
01:01:50,942 --> 01:01:54,209
she lost it, but...
but she got me another one.

941
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,142
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

942
01:01:59,109 --> 01:01:59,809
No.

943
01:02:00,176 --> 01:02:03,609
No, do not try all that
sexy shit with me, Regina.

944
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,709
You are covered in blood
and puke.

945
01:02:08,343 --> 01:02:09,508
Not impressed.

946
01:02:10,475 --> 01:02:12,609
- Told you.
- That's a great cooler.

947
01:02:13,009 --> 01:02:15,942
- Can you open it up?
- A lot of work went into this.

948
01:02:16,609 --> 01:02:21,709
You wouldn't believe the trouble
we went to to get you this.

949
01:02:22,508 --> 01:02:24,109
Now, what the fuck?

950
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:29,009
What the fuck indeed, Regina.

951
01:02:29,109 --> 01:02:30,209
Come here.

952
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:31,575
- Oh, wait.
- Come here!

953
01:02:43,142 --> 01:02:44,076
Thanks for these.

954
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:47,675
Maybe the nicest thing
you ever did for me.

955
01:02:48,243 --> 01:02:50,076
Mandy?

956
01:02:51,609 --> 01:02:53,675
This is the suspicious woman,
ma'am?

957
01:02:54,209 --> 01:02:55,542
I don't think so.

958
01:02:56,343 --> 01:02:57,842
It is Mandy, isn't it?

959
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,508
- Yeah.
- This isn't her.

960
01:03:01,642 --> 01:03:02,575
Mandy?

961
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:04,842
What are you doing
with my patient?

962
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:06,343
- Excuse me.
- Uh...

963
01:03:06,542 --> 01:03:08,876
Goddammit! Again?

964
01:03:09,475 --> 01:03:11,009
All right, now go over
with me again

965
01:03:11,142 --> 01:03:13,209
where you were around 2:00 a.m.

966
01:03:13,609 --> 01:03:15,142
- You saw me.
- In the morgue.

967
01:03:15,276 --> 01:03:16,442
What were you doing
in the morgue?

968
01:03:16,575 --> 01:03:17,842
You have no business
being in there.

969
01:03:18,009 --> 01:03:20,842
I was checking
a deceased patient's records.

970
01:03:21,076 --> 01:03:24,243
Officer Myers,
this woman is on probation.

971
01:03:24,475 --> 01:03:26,309
That is an internal probation

972
01:03:26,442 --> 01:03:27,609
and he doesn't need to know
about it.

973
01:03:27,775 --> 01:03:30,876
It's relevant
and now it's extended.

974
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:33,209
If you were checking records

975
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:35,642
in the morgue,
why were you covered in blood?

976
01:03:36,609 --> 01:03:38,243
Oh, that's what happens
in a morgue.

977
01:03:38,442 --> 01:03:40,809
- But you changed?
- That's what we do.

978
01:03:40,976 --> 01:03:42,909
Don't wanna walk around
covered in blood.

979
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:46,042
That's right.

980
01:03:47,709 --> 01:03:49,909
Come on, Janet, you know me.

981
01:03:50,942 --> 01:03:52,675
What were you doing
with those vials?

982
01:03:52,909 --> 01:03:55,542
Checking them,
seeing what you had him on.

983
01:03:55,742 --> 01:03:57,775
- And why would you do that?
- Hey.

984
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,609
That's enough. I think
we're gonna have to go down

985
01:04:00,742 --> 01:04:02,309
to the station
and talk this thing out.

986
01:04:02,575 --> 01:04:04,209
- Oh!
- Unless, you can explain to me

987
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:05,508
what's going on.

988
01:04:11,276 --> 01:04:12,475
That's my brother.

989
01:04:14,442 --> 01:04:17,042
That's my brother
in that room in a coma.

990
01:04:17,642 --> 01:04:20,842
The drug addict.
I was worried about him.

991
01:04:23,642 --> 01:04:25,142
She's lying.

992
01:04:25,508 --> 01:04:27,909
She has never mentioned
a brother, not once.

993
01:04:28,209 --> 01:04:29,942
I'm not lying, Jesus. I'm...

994
01:04:31,209 --> 01:04:33,809
His name is Andrew McCandry.

995
01:04:34,343 --> 01:04:35,508
My half-brother.

996
01:04:35,675 --> 01:04:39,209
He has OD'd three times
in the past two years.

997
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:40,742
And this time...

998
01:04:42,276 --> 01:04:43,609
may be his last,
according to what

999
01:04:43,742 --> 01:04:46,243
I just read on that chart.
Did you check his files?

1000
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:47,976
- Yeah.
- That's right, isn't it?

1001
01:04:48,442 --> 01:04:50,109
Yeah. That's right.

1002
01:04:50,442 --> 01:04:52,009
I'm sorry,
I really do trust you.

1003
01:04:52,276 --> 01:04:55,909
I just wanted to make sure
he was getting the best care.

1004
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:57,976
I care about him and...

1005
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:05,042
So much I care about him.

1006
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,775
Fuck, I believe you.

1007
01:05:14,942 --> 01:05:16,508
Thank you, Officer Myers.

1008
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:19,375
But you still gotta come down
to the station with me.

1009
01:05:19,508 --> 01:05:21,042
I got a lot of questions
for you, Mandy.

1010
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:23,408
I just answered
all your questions.

1011
01:05:23,575 --> 01:05:24,842
Stephen.

1012
01:05:25,442 --> 01:05:28,542
Ma'am. Uh. We got an issue.
A new one.

1013
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,343
Oh. Mandy, come with me.

1014
01:05:33,209 --> 01:05:37,042
I can still get you a kidney.
I know how.

1015
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:41,109
You are so fucking stupid,
do you know that?

1016
01:05:41,508 --> 01:05:43,842
Every teacher I ever had
told me that already,

1017
01:05:43,976 --> 01:05:44,942
so shut up!

1018
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,542
These nurses...

1019
01:05:48,609 --> 01:05:50,742
they just go for someone
on the verge of death

1020
01:05:50,876 --> 01:05:52,243
so no one notices.

1021
01:05:52,809 --> 01:05:56,109
Me and you can take one
of these dying fuckers

1022
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:58,176
and just drag him on outta here.

1023
01:05:58,675 --> 01:06:00,508
Use a whole damn body
if you want.

1024
01:06:00,675 --> 01:06:02,042
It'll be fresh as hell.

1025
01:06:02,642 --> 01:06:04,876
You'll probably make Nicholas
real happy.

1026
01:06:05,343 --> 01:06:06,976
Well, you don't just get
a kidney.

1027
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:09,675
You get all the organs inside.

1028
01:06:10,775 --> 01:06:13,809
I know the exact dying asshole
you can use.

1029
01:06:21,642 --> 01:06:23,709
Just having a lover's quarrel.

1030
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:25,842
I've been there.

1031
01:06:28,076 --> 01:06:29,076
It's raining, huh?

1032
01:06:29,542 --> 01:06:31,609
Yeah, it's really pissing out
there tonight.

1033
01:06:34,775 --> 01:06:38,742
- I know you. Don't I?
- Regina.

1034
01:06:40,009 --> 01:06:41,842
Didn't you say had someone
you needed to see inside?

1035
01:06:42,009 --> 01:06:45,109
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's leave the man alone.

1036
01:06:48,408 --> 01:06:49,876
Good seeing you again, blondie.

1037
01:06:58,309 --> 01:06:59,542
Call it in.

1038
01:07:00,675 --> 01:07:02,209
- Where's his pants?
- Charmaine,

1039
01:07:02,343 --> 01:07:04,042
we've got a 10-74
at the hospital.

1040
01:07:05,276 --> 01:07:06,542
Looks pretty dead to me.

1041
01:07:25,276 --> 01:07:26,976
Hey, hey, you're not permitted
to leave.

1042
01:07:28,042 --> 01:07:30,309
Hey, Mandy! Mandy, hey!

1043
01:07:30,842 --> 01:07:33,609
Go downstairs, wait for backup.
Hey, hey.

1044
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:35,675
What the hell's wrong with you?

1045
01:07:35,775 --> 01:07:36,508
<i>Mandy!</i>

1046
01:07:36,675 --> 01:07:38,508
- <i>Someone get in here!</i>
- Co... come on!

1047
01:07:47,675 --> 01:07:49,475
- Whoa.
- What the fuck?

1048
01:07:49,609 --> 01:07:51,209
Please, dear, don't curse.

1049
01:07:51,343 --> 01:07:53,209
She's alive, someone get
a stretcher.

1050
01:07:53,343 --> 01:07:54,942
A... all right, everybody
just calm down.

1051
01:07:55,109 --> 01:07:57,942
- I didn't do it.
- What the fuck is happening?

1052
01:07:58,109 --> 01:08:00,442
- What did you do, Mandy?
- I was with you.

1053
01:08:00,575 --> 01:08:01,942
Hey, hey, stay calm.

1054
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:04,309
- I'll go get help.
- No, no, you stay here

1055
01:08:04,442 --> 01:08:05,508
and I... I... I'll call it in.

1056
01:08:05,642 --> 01:08:06,942
We need to get that
woman off the ground

1057
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:09,942
and help her now.
She is bleeding, badly.

1058
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:11,909
Shit! Fuck! Mandy!

1059
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:15,176
You are not permitted
to go anywhere.

1060
01:08:16,042 --> 01:08:18,076
I took an oath to help people,
Officer Myers.

1061
01:08:18,209 --> 01:08:20,442
I'm not just gonna leave Dorothy
on the floor dying.

1062
01:08:20,575 --> 01:08:22,675
And I'm telling you
not to fucking move.

1063
01:08:23,508 --> 01:08:25,942
I'll come clean with you.

1064
01:08:26,642 --> 01:08:28,542
There may be someone
in the hospital

1065
01:08:28,675 --> 01:08:31,609
doing all of this
and I know who it is.

1066
01:08:38,276 --> 01:08:40,142
Shit.

1067
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,809
I fucking hate cops.

1068
01:08:44,042 --> 01:08:45,475
But we already went over this.

1069
01:08:51,876 --> 01:08:52,842
Get the fuck off of him.

1070
01:08:53,176 --> 01:08:55,142
I couldn't find any bleach!

1071
01:08:57,375 --> 01:09:00,009
Oh, man!

1072
01:09:00,243 --> 01:09:01,176
Ooh!

1073
01:09:01,442 --> 01:09:04,408
What the fuck? What the fuck?
Fucking bitch!

1074
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:06,542
Both of you get the fuck outta
here.

1075
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:08,343
I gotta get some organs.

1076
01:09:08,542 --> 01:09:10,976
There is a kidney in the cooler.

1077
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:12,142
It's gone!

1078
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:14,076
- You are lying.
- That's the truth.

1079
01:09:14,842 --> 01:09:17,142
Are you telling me you lost
two kidneys in one night?

1080
01:09:17,276 --> 01:09:18,609
- She said you lost them.
- She did.

1081
01:09:18,675 --> 01:09:19,809
I'm the one who got them
for her.

1082
01:09:19,976 --> 01:09:21,675
- How could I lose 'em?
- This is too much talking.

1083
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:22,876
We taking this guy with us
or what?

1084
01:09:23,009 --> 01:09:25,375
No, you are not. You are gonna
go back to Nicholas

1085
01:09:25,508 --> 01:09:27,442
and you are gonna tell him
this shit is off.

1086
01:09:27,642 --> 01:09:28,976
He can go to hell
and so can you.

1087
01:09:29,109 --> 01:09:31,575
Come on, what the fuck
did Andrew ever do for you

1088
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,942
except give you an addiction,
huh?

1089
01:09:34,076 --> 01:09:36,675
What the fuck is happening?
Get off of her!

1090
01:09:41,176 --> 01:09:43,742
Fuck.

1091
01:09:46,442 --> 01:09:47,909
Freeze!

1092
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:49,109
No!

1093
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:50,742
You freeze.

1094
01:09:51,442 --> 01:09:54,343
Fuck! Fuck.

1095
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:57,343
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1096
01:09:57,609 --> 01:10:00,343
- I don't wanna shoot you!
- You already fucking shot me!

1097
01:10:00,475 --> 01:10:02,142
I don't wanna shoot you again!

1098
01:10:02,442 --> 01:10:03,876
You fucking asshole.

1099
01:10:03,976 --> 01:10:04,675
I have hostages.

1100
01:10:05,042 --> 01:10:06,408
Just back away from the door
and let me through.

1101
01:10:06,575 --> 01:10:07,775
Don't hurt 'em.

1102
01:10:10,109 --> 01:10:11,442
Patch me up, now!

1103
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:14,142
- Okay. Okay.
- Come on.

1104
01:10:14,309 --> 01:10:15,508
- I'm coming.
- Fuck.

1105
01:10:15,709 --> 01:10:16,876
Don't try anything weird.

1106
01:10:24,575 --> 01:10:26,309
The bullet is in there.
You need to get it out.

1107
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:27,442
Yeah, I know that.

1108
01:10:27,609 --> 01:10:29,176
You think this is the first time
I've been shot?

1109
01:10:29,276 --> 01:10:30,742
I'm coming in!

1110
01:10:31,076 --> 01:10:32,742
I swear to God, I will shoot
both these bitches!

1111
01:10:32,909 --> 01:10:35,675
We're gonna go out the backdoor
and you're gonna let us!

1112
01:10:35,809 --> 01:10:36,742
No, you're not!

1113
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:39,009
I will shoot them
if they try anything!

1114
01:10:39,742 --> 01:10:40,942
And we're taking this fucker
with us.

1115
01:10:41,076 --> 01:10:42,809
- Get him in the wheelchair.
- No fucking way.

1116
01:10:43,142 --> 01:10:45,909
Regina said we can have
all his organs, let's go!

1117
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:48,809
You are not taking my brother.

1118
01:10:49,009 --> 01:10:52,009
Save him or save yourself.
It's your choice.

1119
01:10:52,142 --> 01:10:53,742
We are taking him regardless.

1120
01:10:54,076 --> 01:10:56,142
Mandy, what's going on in there?

1121
01:11:00,408 --> 01:11:05,709
Okay. I'll do it.
Get that gun out of my face.

1122
01:11:08,176 --> 01:11:09,109
Regina, get the wheelchair.

1123
01:11:14,176 --> 01:11:15,575
Let's go. Go, go, go, go.

1124
01:11:17,909 --> 01:11:19,775
Damn, get the thing out
of his face.

1125
01:11:24,109 --> 01:11:26,709
Come on, hang on. Dammit.

1126
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:30,809
Goddammit.

1127
01:11:32,942 --> 01:11:33,709
All right.

1128
01:11:34,076 --> 01:11:35,709
Uh. We're gonna head downstairs
and when we get outside,

1129
01:11:35,842 --> 01:11:38,009
- I'm taking him with me.
- Stay where you are!

1130
01:11:38,142 --> 01:11:39,343
Jesus Christ, shut up!

1131
01:11:43,142 --> 01:11:44,809
- Shit!
- What's happening?

1132
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:48,243
Don't these people need, like,
machines to breathe and shit?

1133
01:11:48,675 --> 01:11:50,243
I swear to God,
what did you do, lady?

1134
01:11:50,408 --> 01:11:51,309
It is just the lights.

1135
01:11:51,709 --> 01:11:53,709
Backup generator takes care
of all the vital stuff.

1136
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:58,109
Now... ...we are going
to go down the hall,

1137
01:11:58,243 --> 01:11:59,442
carry him down the stairs,

1138
01:11:59,575 --> 01:12:00,876
and you can go out
the backdoor, okay?

1139
01:12:00,976 --> 01:12:02,442
All right, but I'm taking
Regina with me.

1140
01:12:02,575 --> 01:12:04,842
- Regina is staying here.
- No, she does not.

1141
01:12:05,042 --> 01:12:09,042
That is the deal.
You get Andrew, I get Regina.

1142
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:11,343
You know,
I don't have time for this shit.

1143
01:12:11,475 --> 01:12:15,142
Fine, fuck it, whatever.
You push him. Go!

1144
01:12:18,809 --> 01:12:20,343
Wait, I wanna give him
a sedative.

1145
01:12:20,475 --> 01:12:21,442
Why?

1146
01:12:21,709 --> 01:12:23,309
So he doesn't wake up
in the middle of you

1147
01:12:23,442 --> 01:12:24,642
operating on him.

1148
01:12:29,109 --> 01:12:30,009
Fuck.

1149
01:12:31,642 --> 01:12:34,009
- Fuck!
- You got this?

1150
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:36,475
Yeah. Yeah.

1151
01:12:38,408 --> 01:12:39,909
Nurse, hurry up!

1152
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:46,142
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck is going on?

1153
01:12:46,276 --> 01:12:47,909
- I'm nervous.
- Junkie.

1154
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:57,176
Oh, my fucking eye!

1155
01:12:57,309 --> 01:12:59,076
- Go.
- Bitches!

1156
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,243
Why take Andrew? Leave him.

1157
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:02,976
I don't want him
taken away for organs.

1158
01:13:03,076 --> 01:13:04,243
Why the fuck are you so nice

1159
01:13:04,309 --> 01:13:05,609
to someone
who just treated you like shit?

1160
01:13:05,709 --> 01:13:07,408
- You treat me like shit.
- We gotta go.

1161
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:08,909
- Hold on!
- Get up!

1162
01:13:31,942 --> 01:13:34,742
- He's got my knife.
- Crazy cunts.

1163
01:13:38,142 --> 01:13:39,209
I'm going out the front.

1164
01:13:39,343 --> 01:13:42,009
I can't do that,
they got cops outside.

1165
01:13:42,343 --> 01:13:43,909
Mandy?

1166
01:13:44,176 --> 01:13:45,076
Mandy?

1167
01:13:45,442 --> 01:13:46,942
Did you hear that noise,
what the fuck is going on?

1168
01:13:47,276 --> 01:13:48,209
Janet, run!

1169
01:13:51,742 --> 01:13:53,842
Goddammit.

1170
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:57,709
Sorry, ma'am.

1171
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:00,876
Go in that room
and lock the door.

1172
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:01,942
Go!

1173
01:14:09,209 --> 01:14:10,375
Shit.

1174
01:14:10,508 --> 01:14:12,142
Someone turned out
my nightlight.

1175
01:14:12,276 --> 01:14:13,375
What is happening here?

1176
01:14:13,475 --> 01:14:14,642
Do you know why the lights
went out?

1177
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:16,309
And is this blood on the floor?

1178
01:14:16,442 --> 01:14:18,009
Y'all just need to stay cool.

1179
01:14:19,009 --> 01:14:20,009
Shit.

1180
01:14:25,642 --> 01:14:28,042
You assholes took my eye!

1181
01:14:29,575 --> 01:14:32,375
Janet, Janet.
Come on, come on.

1182
01:14:34,042 --> 01:14:35,442
That's right, put your head up.

1183
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:41,109
What's going on?

1184
01:14:42,942 --> 01:14:44,976
Okay, lift up
for one second, one second.

1185
01:14:45,142 --> 01:14:46,575
Okay.

1186
01:14:53,508 --> 01:14:56,775
No! That's my friend!
From church!

1187
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:00,142
Dammit.

1188
01:15:00,575 --> 01:15:02,408
Get the fuck outta here!

1189
01:15:02,542 --> 01:15:03,976
He's in there. Run.

1190
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:06,109
- Get the fuck over here!
- No!

1191
01:15:06,209 --> 01:15:07,276
You think
you can just run away

1192
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:08,609
and I wouldn't catch you?

1193
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:09,809
Well, now I'm taking
both of y'all,

1194
01:15:09,909 --> 01:15:11,775
you and the fucking
wheelchair boy.

1195
01:15:11,909 --> 01:15:13,876
There's gotta be something
useful inside each of you,

1196
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:16,408
unless yours is blackened
from painkillers!

1197
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:17,809
Mikey, don't hurt her.

1198
01:15:20,976 --> 01:15:24,475
Okay, y'all go!
Go, this ain't gonna last long.

1199
01:15:26,009 --> 01:15:27,009
Run!

1200
01:15:30,042 --> 01:15:31,442
Oh, shit.

1201
01:16:06,742 --> 01:16:08,976
Oh, come on.

1202
01:16:09,243 --> 01:16:10,909
What the fuck, ladies?

1203
01:16:12,343 --> 01:16:13,976
I know you're out here
somewhere.

1204
01:16:18,876 --> 01:16:20,909
Come on, bitches,
it's cold out here!

1205
01:16:21,042 --> 01:16:22,375
Where you at?

1206
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:24,609
Woo.

1207
01:16:25,542 --> 01:16:26,809
You out in that rain?

1208
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:29,408
Ooh, you better be running
in that rain!

1209
01:16:29,575 --> 01:16:32,775
You better be singing
in that rain! Enjoying it!

1210
01:16:34,209 --> 01:16:35,542
But I know you're not...

1211
01:16:36,609 --> 01:16:38,408
not with all them cops
out there...

1212
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:41,542
'cause I may do some...

1213
01:16:43,109 --> 01:16:44,408
illegal shit...

1214
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:48,809
but it ain't nothing
compared to you two lunatics.

1215
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:52,976
But I got plans for y'all.

1216
01:16:58,842 --> 01:16:59,809
Mm.

1217
01:17:00,976 --> 01:17:01,909
Spurt.

1218
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:05,642
Better come on out...

1219
01:17:06,942 --> 01:17:09,675
'cause both y'all have
an appointment...

1220
01:17:10,343 --> 01:17:12,842
to have all your little organs
taken outta

1221
01:17:12,976 --> 01:17:14,408
your skinny little bodies!

1222
01:17:33,642 --> 01:17:35,109
- He's dead.
- No.

1223
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:45,575
Are you a good witch
or bad witch?

1224
01:17:48,209 --> 01:17:49,109
There cops out there?

1225
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:51,176
Yeah, and we'll scream
if you try anything.

1226
01:17:51,343 --> 01:17:52,876
- No, you won't.
- Are you here to kill us?

1227
01:17:52,976 --> 01:17:55,276
No. But I need your help
getting outta here.

1228
01:17:55,508 --> 01:17:56,709
Mandy, do something, help me.

1229
01:17:56,842 --> 01:17:59,309
No, you're a fucking psychopath.
This is all your fault.

1230
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:02,343
- It's yours.
- Just take her.

1231
01:18:02,609 --> 01:18:05,642
Thank you kindly, ma'am.
She sure is a pretty one.

1232
01:18:08,343 --> 01:18:12,375
Blonde hair and blue eyes.

1233
01:18:25,009 --> 01:18:26,276
I wasn't gonna hurt her.

1234
01:18:26,609 --> 01:18:28,575
I was just gonna use
her to get outta here.

1235
01:18:28,775 --> 01:18:32,442
You better hurry up.

1236
01:18:33,309 --> 01:18:36,542
- You girls are crazy.
- Go home, Regina.

1237
01:18:37,176 --> 01:18:39,575
Get the fuck outta here.

1238
01:18:40,542 --> 01:18:42,909
Is this gonna give me a disease?

1239
01:18:43,309 --> 01:18:45,142
No, just go home.

1240
01:18:46,309 --> 01:18:47,642
You can't wear that.

1241
01:18:48,243 --> 01:18:49,508
Take it off.

1242
01:18:50,742 --> 01:18:52,942
Am I... am I fired?

1243
01:18:53,209 --> 01:18:54,109
Oh, yeah.

1244
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:57,709
Yeah. I... I won't tell no one.

1245
01:18:58,909 --> 01:19:00,042
I know you won't.

1246
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:14,109
See you around, then, cuz.

1247
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:18,675
Yeah. See ya.

1248
01:19:23,508 --> 01:19:25,142
<i>More on that in the next hour.</i>

1249
01:19:25,609 --> 01:19:27,309
<i>Our top story this
morning concerns</i>

1250
01:19:27,442 --> 01:19:29,508
<i>the three deaths reported
at the local hospital</i>

1251
01:19:29,642 --> 01:19:32,408
<i>over night, with two additional
people in critical condition.</i>

1252
01:19:32,942 --> 01:19:35,709
<i>What's now being considered
a combination of a suicide,</i>

1253
01:19:35,876 --> 01:19:38,542
<i>a potential homicide,
and a freak accident</i>

1254
01:19:38,742 --> 01:19:40,709
<i>is currently
under investigation.</i>

1255
01:19:42,408 --> 01:19:43,575
<i>The police are
on the scene now,</i>

1256
01:19:43,709 --> 01:19:46,276
<i>but due to the Y2K
preparation weekend,</i>

1257
01:19:46,408 --> 01:19:48,309
<i>much of the police force
wasn't in the area</i>

1258
01:19:48,475 --> 01:19:49,742
<i>when the events
began to unfold.</i>

1259
01:19:49,876 --> 01:19:51,642
<i>But the official statement
from the chief</i>

1260
01:19:52,009 --> 01:19:53,575
<i>is that the delays
in police arrival</i>

1261
01:19:53,742 --> 01:19:55,309
<i>did not contribute
to additional...</i>

1262
01:19:55,475 --> 01:19:56,876
<i>...deaths and injuries.</i>

1263
01:19:58,542 --> 01:19:59,709
<i>It's been a tragic year.</i>

1264
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:01,508
<i>We extend our condolences
to the families</i>

1265
01:20:01,675 --> 01:20:04,076
<i>of those injured or killed
in the hospital last night.</i>

1266
01:20:04,642 --> 01:20:05,876
<i>The investigation
is still open,</i>

1267
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:08,542
<i>but we've been informed
that the area is secure.</i>

1268
01:20:08,675 --> 01:20:10,942
<i>We'll be hearing more
from the police later today.</i>

1269
01:20:33,675 --> 01:20:38,209
I told Officer Myers all that.
And he said I was free to leave.

1270
01:20:40,542 --> 01:20:43,508
I was real sad
about Mr. Collins.

1271
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:47,575
He just couldn't handle
being here anymore.

1272
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:52,542
No one deserves to go that way,
but I... I think it was suicide.

1273
01:20:52,775 --> 01:20:56,775
Uh, uh. Sir,
you are not listening to me.

1274
01:20:57,176 --> 01:20:58,076
He was a madman.

1275
01:20:58,309 --> 01:20:59,675
He... he clearly killed
all these people.

1276
01:20:59,775 --> 01:21:01,809
I mean, what kind
of hospital is this?

1277
01:21:01,976 --> 01:21:04,176
Ma'am, uh,
can I get you a drink of water?

1278
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:06,475
- Yes, you can!
- You wanna come with me?

1279
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:12,709
She's right. He was crazy.

1280
01:21:14,775 --> 01:21:16,408
We may have some
more questions for you,

1281
01:21:16,575 --> 01:21:18,375
but I think I've got
all your information,

1282
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:19,942
so you should be okay.

1283
01:21:35,243 --> 01:21:37,709
- Is everybody dead?
- No.

1284
01:21:39,276 --> 01:21:41,109
Janet may not be able
to talk for a while,

1285
01:21:41,243 --> 01:21:43,575
but that cute cop
ain't doing so good.

1286
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:47,642
- Cute ones always die.
- You mind helping?

1287
01:21:49,109 --> 01:21:50,642
My shift just ended.

1288
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:52,775
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1289
01:21:54,475 --> 01:21:56,276
Don't you dare touch her.

1290
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:59,442
I don't want anyone
in this hospital near her!

1291
01:22:00,142 --> 01:22:01,176
Are you going home?

1292
01:22:01,909 --> 01:22:05,042
No, they want me to stay
until things get settled.

1293
01:22:05,508 --> 01:22:07,375
That's a long shift for you.

1294
01:22:07,675 --> 01:22:09,642
Yeah, well,
I'm getting overtime.

1295
01:22:11,809 --> 01:22:16,742
- Uh... I'll see you later.
- Yeah, see ya.

1296
01:22:23,976 --> 01:22:24,909
How you doing?

1297
01:22:26,575 --> 01:22:28,076
That was very strange.

1298
01:22:28,575 --> 01:22:30,976
Why is this so small?
And this so big?

1299
01:22:31,243 --> 01:22:33,575
Who's gonna do something
with these bags that I found?

1300
01:22:33,709 --> 01:22:34,775
Who's gonna help me with this?

1301
01:22:35,109 --> 01:22:37,575
Someone gonna do something
with these bags that I found?

1302
01:22:38,243 --> 01:22:39,309
I found this one,

1303
01:22:39,442 --> 01:22:41,309
looks like they're
chock-full of organ meat.

1304
01:22:41,508 --> 01:22:43,309
I found this
at the soda machine.

1305
01:22:43,575 --> 01:22:44,775
I went down for a nice drink

1306
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:46,775
and then I went down
again later,

1307
01:22:46,876 --> 01:22:48,276
'cause no one's seen me
for a while,

1308
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:49,542
and then I found this one.

1309
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:51,942
It looks like someone
was keeping them there.

1310
01:22:52,508 --> 01:22:54,009
Oh, oh, now you're gonna
pay attention.

1311
01:22:54,109 --> 01:22:55,909
- Got the organs in my hands.
- Whoa, whoa.

1312
01:22:56,009 --> 01:22:56,909
Okay, thank you.

1313
01:22:57,109 --> 01:22:59,709
This has about seven
or eight different ones inside.

1314
01:22:59,909 --> 01:23:02,508
Yeah, and I had... I kept
the soda far away, it's fine.

1315
01:23:02,575 --> 01:23:04,209
I'm a little dizzy.
You need to be very careful

1316
01:23:04,276 --> 01:23:05,408
with your hands.

1317
01:25:58,105 --> 01:26:03,105
