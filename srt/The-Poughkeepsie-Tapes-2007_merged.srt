1
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:06,295
(lion roaring)

2
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:15,804
(wind blowing)

3
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:25,525
(downbeat music)

4
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,038
[Girl] Look at her smile, see, like

5
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:44,412
- her dimples stick out.
- The Lord is my shepherd.

6
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,253
[Girl] Know what I mean?

7
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:48,295
[Priest] I shall not want.

8
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,510
He makes me lie down in green pastures.

9
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:55,590
He leads me beside still waters.

10
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:58,634
He restores my soul.

11
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:04,265
He leads me in paths of
righteousness for his name's...

12
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:16,444
The story of Cheryl
Dempsey and what she became

13
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,413
is truly one of the strangest,
most disturbing things

14
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:23,501
I've ever come across in the
history of serial murder.

15
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:28,714
I've been doing this for
close to 25 years now.

16
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:43,475
(car door slamming)

17
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,223
(engine rumbling)

18
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:02,161
(downbeat creepy music)

19
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:03,350
I had a tenant in this house here

20
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:05,891
who was a very terrible person.

21
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,891
This is the house where they
found the Poughkeepsie tapes.

22
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,892
Before we got our hands
on the Poughkeepsie tapes,

23
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,610
we thought...

24
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:15,024
Well, we knew there had been some killings

25
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,897
and we were aware that
some of them appeared

26
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,899
as though they were being carried out

27
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,446
in an organized fashion,

28
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:23,321
but until we got our hands on those tapes,

29
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,699
we had no idea what we were dealing with.

30
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:29,584
No idea.

31
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,796
It was my job to watch
and log all 2,400 hours

32
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:34,415
of the Poughkeepsie tapes.

33
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,507
In the first month alone,

34
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:39,049
I couldn't sleep for more
than an hour or two at night.

35
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:40,762
I still have nightmares about them.

36
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:44,804
I think torturing and
murdering turn him on.

37
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,349
And I think these tapes are something

38
00:03:47,344 --> 00:03:50,598
of a homemade porn film or a memento

39
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,396
that he can savor long after the murder.

40
00:03:53,392 --> 00:03:54,735
He has definitely stalled

41
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:58,606
halfway through many a
killing to switch tapes.

42
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:01,867
I remember one night,

43
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:03,827
I brought some of the tapes home with me

44
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,699
to keep working, and unbeknownst to me,

45
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:11,248
my wife watched about half
an hour of one of the tapes

46
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:15,373
and it took her a year before
she let me touch her again.

47
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,419
That's what's on those tapes.

48
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:24,006
They found the tapes in this closet.

49
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:26,008
(camera shutter snapping)

50
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:27,931
And down here, you know.

51
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,066
When we searched the yard we
found the bodies of two women

52
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:35,434
there, and there.

53
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,779
We found a deep hole here
where there was buried

54
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,523
a young couple and
their 10-month-old baby.

55
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:43,696
There was a body of a man there,

56
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:47,822
and four more women there,
there, there, and there.

57
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:53,043
And it was obvious that they'd all

58
00:04:53,035 --> 00:04:55,709
been killed in a horrific manner.

59
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:58,253
(Creepy music)

60
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,595
Beside me here is one
complete set of the tapes.

61
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:06,386
And just to give you a
sense, from about here,

62
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:19,899
to here, are all about Cheryl Dempsey.

63
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:21,317
When people think of serial killers

64
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:23,156
they think of four or five people.

65
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:26,869
You know, Ted Bundy,
Dahmer, Gacy, et cetera.

66
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,118
But what most people don't realize

67
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:32,332
is how many more there are.

68
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:35,998
At any given time, there
are somewhere between

69
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:40,044
25 and 50 active serial
killers in America alone.

70
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:45,838
It is really a much bigger
problem than most people realize.

71
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:50,055
There are probably hours
and hours of these tapes

72
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,348
that nobody's watched except me.

73
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:55,974
Like, for example, there's over 100 hours

74
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:59,102
of weird balloon stuff on these tapes.

75
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:07,367
Like this?

76
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,235
[Ed] Yes.

77
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,418
Like this?

78
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,294
[Ed] Yes.

79
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:30,925
Now pop it.

80
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,471
What?

81
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:33,593
[Ed] Pop it!

82
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:40,856
(Creepy music)

83
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,574
If I've learned one thing

84
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:50,661
from teaching this class, it's this.

85
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:53,781
After what we're gonna see here today,

86
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,499
three of you will go home tonight

87
00:06:56,491 --> 00:07:01,088
and decide that this is not
what you want with your life.

88
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,174
You know, there are some
terrible people in this world

89
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,136
who do unbelievably terrible things.

90
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,350
So it's important that
each of you ask yourself,

91
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:17,688
do I really wanna surround
myself with these terrible things

92
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:20,728
for the rest of my professional life?

93
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:25,730
And it's okay if you don't.

94
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:29,279
I would guess something
happened in his life at that time.

95
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:33,654
He got in a fight, lost a
job, got left by his wife,

96
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:37,284
something like that,
and went out in his car

97
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:39,956
and at some point said,

98
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:43,330
the next vulnerable person I see is dead.

99
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:50,651
[Ed] Hi.

100
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,703
I like your dolls.

101
00:08:59,781 --> 00:09:01,909
I said, I like your dolls.

102
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:04,211
What's that one's name?

103
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:05,249
Susie.

104
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,374
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

105
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,168
[Ed] Well, you're not supposed

106
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,387
to have bad manners either.

107
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,224
You know, if I was the Big Bad Wolf

108
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:21,186
there's nothing you can do about it.

109
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:26,517
You wanna say something to the camera?

110
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:27,483
Like what?

111
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,193
[Ed] I don't know.

112
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:31,314
Maybe you could say, I am,

113
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:36,030
I am a happy, pretty little girl.

114
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:38,282
No.

115
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:43,618
[Ed] You wanna see what it
looks like through the camera?

116
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,413
No.

117
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
[Ed] Here.
(loud thumping)
(Ed grunting)

118
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:22,410
(engine rumbling)

119
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,920
(man breathing heavily)

120
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,757
On first inspection, it looked like

121
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:39,598
she had been hit in the
head with a blunt object.

122
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:42,513
We found there was a missing
girl, Jennifer Gorman,

123
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,264
eight years old, from Putnam
County, about 50 miles away,

124
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:50,439
fitting the description,
last seen in similar clothes.

125
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:53,562
(gentle creepy music)

126
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:01,828
[Cynthia] I think something bad

127
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,867
has happened to my daughter.

128
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:03,910
I think somebody took her.

129
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:05,327
- Like who?
- I don't know who!

130
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:06,165
Out of the yard!

131
00:11:06,157 --> 00:11:08,034
There's blood out there,
please, do something.

132
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,126
Do something, do something!

133
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:09,961
- Somebody took her!
- If it's a missing person

134
00:11:09,953 --> 00:11:11,250
- we have to wait 24 hours.
- No!

135
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:13,465
There is blood, there is blood out there.

136
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:15,174
Send the police now!

137
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,715
(Creepy music)

138
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:24,517
Obviously, you don't ever
get over something like this.

139
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:27,729
You think the pain will subside, and...

140
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:33,901
And get better.

141
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:37,989
But it doesn't.

142
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,028
Not at all.

143
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:44,280
What kind of a sick bastard
rapes a little girl.

144
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,077
She was just a child.

145
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,325
She was barely eight.

146
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:49,372
I'm so sorry.

147
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:52,166
(Cynthia weeping)

148
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,845
This is nothing.

149
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:02,589
He doesn't even know what he's doing yet.

150
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,968
(ominous music building)

151
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:11,806
Hey, having a little car problem?

152
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:13,524
[Ed] Yeah, this old thing

153
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:16,235
isn't even worth driving some days.

154
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:18,355
Could I get a lift into the next town?

155
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:19,197
Yeah, no problem.

156
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:19,985
Hop in.

157
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:31,126
[Ed] Do you mind if I film this?

158
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,963
I'm making a little movie about my trip.

159
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,878
Knock yourself out.

160
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:39,922
Look Hon, we're gonna be movie stars.

161
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:44,844
So what's your name?

162
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:45,635
[Ed] Ed.

163
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,559
Ed, I'm Frank, this is Jeanette.

164
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:49,347
Hi.

165
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:57,314
[Ed] If you take this exit up here,

166
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,154
you can drop me off at
the little gas station.

167
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,363
[Frank] Okay.

168
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:14,582
[Ed] It's to the right here,

169
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:17,000
just a couple miles off the freeway.

170
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,466
[Frank] All right.

171
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:21,505
[Jeanette] You from around here?

172
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:22,969
[Ed] Not really.

173
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,848
Where are you from?

174
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:32,304
[Ed] I think the gas
station's right around the bend.

175
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

176
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:59,168
[Jeanette] Oh my god!

177
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:00,336
Oh my god!

178
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:04,461
(car crashing)
(Jeanette screaming)

179
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:11,393
(ominous music)
(heavy breathing)

180
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,945
A Poughkeepsie couple
vanished over the weekend,

181
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,817
seemingly without a trace.

182
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:29,319
Family members say they haven't heard

183
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:30,866
from Frank or Jeanette Anderson

184
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:33,035
since they left Pittsburgh last Friday.

185
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:34,658
Authorities still have no leads

186
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:36,284
as to the couple's whereabouts.

187
00:14:36,284 --> 00:14:40,460
This homicide announces a
completely new kind of killer.

188
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:42,924
There is almost nothing
left of the impulsiveness

189
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,886
that he displayed with Jennifer Gorman.

190
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:50,599
Here is a man who's figured
out he's good at something.

191
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,184
Imagine what it would take to do this.

192
00:14:53,176 --> 00:14:55,725
From the seat behind her he takes a rag

193
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,394
with some sort of chemical
agent with his right hand,

194
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:01,188
and he places it over her mouth.

195
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:02,936
And with his left hand holding the camera

196
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,109
he's reaching it out and holding it

197
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:08,154
in front of her face like this.

198
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:11,574
This isn't the kind of
thing that just happens.

199
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:14,869
He must've practiced this motion
thoroughly to get it right.

200
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:17,708
I mean, his car's
parked alongside the road.

201
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,579
He knows where the next gas station is,

202
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:23,457
he knows it's only a mile
or two off the freeway,

203
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,800
and he knows that it's a desolate area

204
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,887
between the freeway and the gas station.

205
00:15:28,878 --> 00:15:31,757
In fact, this station is abandoned,

206
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,848
and I bet he knows that too.

207
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:39,644
And he had a ready made
excuse for the camera.

208
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:44,482
This man is what we call a mixed killer.

209
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:48,277
He plots and hides his crimes
in an organized manner,

210
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:52,403
but he mutilates and does,
well, let's say similar things

211
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:57,616
with the bodies that a
disorganized killer would do.

212
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:05,589
[Ed] Wake up.

213
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:07,671
Wake up.

214
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:10,295
Come on, wake up.

215
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:15,634
Come on, wake up, I
have a surprise for you.

216
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:17,886
Wake up.

217
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,724
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.

218
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:23,725
Wake up.

219
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:25,939
Wake up.

220
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:27,983
Wake up.

221
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,235
Wake up.

222
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:36,203
You're gonna love this.

223
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:40,326
(woman groaning)
(Creepy music)

224
00:16:58,676 --> 00:16:59,893
Yeah, I know.

225
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:04,349
Today the search for a
missing Poughkeepsie couple

226
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,193
ends tragically, this when
human remains are found

227
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:10,155
buried in a wooded area
of rural Pennsylvania.

228
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:11,523
They brought a woman's body in

229
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:13,900
that was very badly mutilated.

230
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,403
The corpse had a head
placed in its abdomen

231
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,781
in a kind of strange, ceremonial fashion.

232
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:21,783
I took one look at the skull,

233
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:24,252
the upper edges of the
eye orbits were smooth,

234
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,087
and the cranial vault was rigid,

235
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,423
and showed heavy muscular markings.

236
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,543
I said, this is a man's
head in a woman's body.

237
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:33,965
This is two murders, not one.

238
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:35,839
After talking to their
friends and families,

239
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:38,307
we were able to ascertain
that the Andersons

240
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:40,267
were coming back from Pittsburgh

241
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,854
to Poughkeepsie where they lived.

242
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:47,146
That distance winds up
being about 350 miles or so.

243
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:49,894
The nice thing about this route,

244
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:51,988
is that there are really only a couple

245
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,403
of logical ways to drive it.

246
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:56,777
Under the best conditions,
that particular make of car

247
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,199
can only go about 200 miles to the tank,

248
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:00,742
more likely about 150.

249
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:03,958
So we went from that point on the freeway,

250
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,248
200 miles in both directions,

251
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:09,168
and we went to every gas
station along the route

252
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:11,541
and asked to see their surveillance tapes

253
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,589
from that particular day.

254
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:17,681
That took some doing,
but we did manage to get

255
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:21,802
our first video image of
the killer in this manner.

256
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:26,602
(gentle music)

257
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:36,107
[Student] What's he doing with his hand?

258
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:37,984
[Student] He's signing.

259
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,452
[Mike] That's right.

260
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:41,617
Anybody know what he's saying?

261
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:42,579
Red house.

262
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:44,619
Good.

263
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:48,666
Right, we found the
second body in the woods

264
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,790
behind a place called the Red House Tavern

265
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:54,042
about three miles away.

266
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:57,216
But the thing to keep in mind is this.

267
00:18:57,211 --> 00:19:01,182
He signed this before he
even met the Andersons.

268
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:06,180
Timeliness is of the
essence in any investigation,

269
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,523
but especially a murder.

270
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,141
If we find a fresh crime scene,

271
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:13,315
there's just a lot more
information to work with

272
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:15,029
than say, a skeleton.

273
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:19,951
Often, the serial killers who
avoid detection and capture

274
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:24,413
are the ones who are especially
good at disposing of bodies.

275
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:28,251
The killer documented on
the Poughkeepsie tapes

276
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:30,995
is very, very good at it.

277
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:33,544
Not only does he know
how to dispose of bodies,

278
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,715
he knows how to dispose of
bodies in many different ways.

279
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,509
Elizabeth Jackson was
abducted in Hanson County,

280
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:42,849
which is about 100 miles from the location

281
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,184
we later found the tapes in.

282
00:19:45,176 --> 00:19:46,894
The killer then took a circular saw,

283
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,355
cut off her head and hands.

284
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:52,726
He then dumped her torso in Putnam County,

285
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,069
and her head and hands in Broome County.

286
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,029
When someone's disposed of like this,

287
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:59,649
it's almost impossible
to put it all together

288
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:03,244
because even if the
various counties did talk,

289
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,989
and they don't, but even if they did,

290
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:10,084
there may be a five year
gap between finding the head

291
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,171
and the torso of a body like this.

292
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:16,382
I see this and I say, okay,

293
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:20,216
here's a killer who
understands bureaucracy.

294
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:22,760
(Creepy music)

295
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,719
Usually a killer won't think through

296
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:29,595
their first dismembering,

297
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,188
and they have a dead body in the house

298
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,807
and they need to take it apart.

299
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,855
So they go out to the garage and get a saw

300
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:38,651
and take some hours to get the head off.

301
00:20:38,646 --> 00:20:41,445
So the next time, they'll
go and get a better saw

302
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:44,320
before they kill someone, and
that makes it a little better,

303
00:20:44,318 --> 00:20:48,118
but if they really wanna
get into the killing,

304
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:53,795
they'll often go and get a real saw.

305
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:58,587
Something that cuts
through quick and easy.

306
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:03,342
And at that point, they'll
never go back to a handsaw.

307
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:06,807
Except this guy, he did it repeatedly.

308
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,303
Sometimes he uses a circular
saw, sometimes a handsaw.

309
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,520
It's part of the reason that we never

310
00:21:11,512 --> 00:21:13,981
grouped his killings together.

311
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:17,519
It's probably why he did it.

312
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:20,146
But after all that effort
to mask his killings,

313
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:24,492
He shows us each and every
disassembly in his tapes.

314
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,033
I guess he just wanted
someone to appreciate

315
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:30,032
how good he is at this,
and the thought that maybe

316
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:33,661
we'd be strangely sort
of impressed with it.

317
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,170
[Interviewer] Are you?

318
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,334
No.

319
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,583
After seeing what he
did to Cheryl Dempsey,

320
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:43,212
I could feel nothing but
loathing for this guy.

321
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:45,839
(ominous music)

322
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:10,075
(radio crackling)

323
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:20,248
[Cheryl] It was so sweet.

324
00:22:20,248 --> 00:22:22,671
[Tim] Should've gone with you.

325
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:23,463
(garbled speech)

326
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:24,301
[Cheryl] Cow's gone on her trip.

327
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:27,137
My mom was being such a bitch.

328
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:28,255
[Tim] How long are they gone for?

329
00:22:28,256 --> 00:22:30,008
[Cheryl] Like a week.

330
00:22:30,007 --> 00:22:31,680
[Tim] Like Wednesday, right?

331
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:32,973
[Cheryl] Yeah.

332
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,724
(garbled speech)

333
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,599
[Tim] No.

334
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:40,768
[Cheryl] Tim?

335
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:42,111
[Tim] Yeah?

336
00:22:42,103 --> 00:22:45,903
[Cheryl] Do you ever get a feeling?

337
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,070
[Tim] What do you mean?

338
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:51,572
[Cheryl] Like feeling like
something's going to happen?

339
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,369
[Tim] Sometimes, why?

340
00:22:53,364 --> 00:22:54,365
[Cheryl] It's weird.

341
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:56,538
Everything's been so good lately.

342
00:22:56,534 --> 00:22:59,629
Everybody seems to be happy,
and everything's just like,

343
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,497
too good, you know?

344
00:23:01,497 --> 00:23:04,467
(low ominous music)

345
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:21,346
(shower water pattering)

346
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:42,075
[Cheryl] Hello?

347
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:44,000
Is that you?

348
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:46,374
Tim?

349
00:26:01,469 --> 00:26:02,345
[Tim] Hello?

350
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:03,220
[Cheryl] Hello?

351
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,346
Is that you?

352
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:06,269
[Tim] Hey, you mind if
I grab something to eat?

353
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,266
[Cheryl] Yeah, go ahead.

354
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,643
Can you grab some ice cream
while you're down there?

355
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:09,689
[Tim] Sure.

356
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:14,574
[Cheryl] Will you grab me a towel?

357
00:26:15,483 --> 00:26:18,077
I know you're still there.

358
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:20,617
Come on, you're not scaring me.

359
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:29,880
[Tim] Hey, what kind of ice cream did you want?

360
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:31,465
[Cheryl] Whatever, chocolate?

361
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:32,504
[Tim] Done.

362
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,619
(ominous music)

363
00:27:20,297 --> 00:27:21,549
You scared me.

364
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:23,176
You shouldn't jump out
at somebody like that.

365
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,472
[Tim] Sorry.

366
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:27,267
I brought you ice cream, and beer.

367
00:27:27,263 --> 00:27:28,059
Thanks.

368
00:27:29,056 --> 00:27:31,400
Why did you move my clothes?

369
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:32,769
[Tim] I didn't.

370
00:27:33,727 --> 00:27:36,276
They were all over the place.

371
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:42,027
[Tim] Come here.

372
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,279
[Cheryl] Why?

373
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,155
[Tim] You'll see.

374
00:27:44,154 --> 00:27:46,532
(Cheryl chuckling)

375
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:48,375
[Cheryl] Let's just go watch a movie.

376
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,040
[Tim] Like what?

377
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,413
[Cheryl] I rented a couple.

378
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:57,294
[Tim] You wanna stay here for a while?

379
00:27:57,293 --> 00:27:59,466
Maybe for a little while.

380
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:02,431
(suspenseful music)

381
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:28,583
(low ominous music)

382
00:29:24,338 --> 00:29:25,590
Hey.

383
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:27,967
We're starting to fall asleep.

384
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:30,095
You wanna go to bed?

385
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:31,687
[Tim] Yeah, yeah okay.

386
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,976
[Cheryl] You're staying over tonight, right?

387
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:34,269
[Tim] Yeah.

388
00:29:34,264 --> 00:29:35,231
[Cheryl] Cool.

389
00:29:35,224 --> 00:29:37,818
I get a little scared here by myself.

390
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,812
[Tim] I think I might too.

391
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:41,485
[Cheryl] Do you mind putting
this stuff in the sink?

392
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,232
I just wanna pee and brush my teeth.

393
00:29:43,232 --> 00:29:44,449
No, it's fine.

394
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:46,159
[Cheryl] Thank you.

395
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
(glass shattering)

396
00:30:15,723 --> 00:30:19,853
(fighting impacts and cries)
(ominous music)

397
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:25,942
(Cheryl whimpering)
(frightening music building)

398
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:34,416
(low rumbling music)

399
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:40,923
(Ed breathing heavily)

400
00:30:58,932 --> 00:31:02,402
(rumbling music building)

401
00:31:06,648 --> 00:31:09,447
This weekend ends in
tragedy for one family.

402
00:31:09,443 --> 00:31:11,821
Victoria and James Dempsey returned home

403
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,663
after leaving their 19-year-old daughter,

404
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:16,329
Cheryl Dempsey, home
alone for the weekend.

405
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:18,703
Now when they returned
they found Cheryl missing,

406
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:23,082
and her boyfriend, Tim
Surrey, brutally murdered.

407
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:27,633
I remember maybe three days
before Cheryl's abduction

408
00:31:27,628 --> 00:31:32,099
she asked me, do you ever feel
like someone's watching you?

409
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:33,889
I said not really.

410
00:31:33,884 --> 00:31:35,886
And she told me, sometimes I feel like

411
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:39,186
maybe someone's following me around.

412
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:41,354
I said, you know, you're
probably just being paranoid.

413
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,444
And she said, yeah, maybe.

414
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:47,277
You know, hindsight's 20/20.

415
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:50,151
(disjointed music)

416
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,204
What's happening?

417
00:31:53,195 --> 00:31:54,071
Where am I?

418
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,085
Stay away from me!

419
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:00,873
Stay away!

420
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,623
Why are you doing this to me?

421
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,422
(Cheryl shouting)

422
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:10,504
Please don't hurt me.

423
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,974
I'll do whatever you want.

424
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,183
I know you will.

425
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:16,051
(Cheryl mumbling)

426
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:16,847
Shut up!

427
00:32:21,014 --> 00:32:22,982
What is your name?

428
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,147
Cheryl Dempsey.

429
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:24,939
Wrong!

430
00:32:28,063 --> 00:32:29,610
Your name is slave.

431
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:35,579
What is your name?

432
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:37,994
Cheryl.

433
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,415
(pained groaning)

434
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,128
Your name is slave!

435
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:48,000
What is your name?

436
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,092
My name is slave!

437
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:50,210
[Ed] What is your name?

438
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,712
[Cheryl] Slave!

439
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,339
What is your name?

440
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,134
Slave!

441
00:33:00,053 --> 00:33:01,145
[Ed] Good.

442
00:33:01,138 --> 00:33:04,358
(Ed breathing heavily)

443
00:33:15,444 --> 00:33:18,869
Because of the gruesome
condition of Tim's body,

444
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:21,242
we had very little hope
of finding Cheryl alive.

445
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:24,370
His head had been crushed
in, kind of like this.

446
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:29,341
And he had been cut from
his anus up to his throat,

447
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:32,086
and his intestines had been pulled out

448
00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:35,715
and strewn around like they
were Christmas tree lights.

449
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:38,888
And his genitals had been
removed and they were placed

450
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:42,605
in the sock drawer in the master bedroom.

451
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:44,018
Our basic thinking was that the killer

452
00:33:44,014 --> 00:33:47,439
had lost all control of his faculties,

453
00:33:47,434 --> 00:33:50,529
and again, judging from
the condition of the body,

454
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,024
that he had probably killed her here,

455
00:33:54,024 --> 00:33:57,995
and then probably dumped
her body in the woods.

456
00:33:57,986 --> 00:33:59,488
We took one look at the
scene and wrote it off

457
00:33:59,488 --> 00:34:02,037
as the work of a disorganized killer.

458
00:34:02,032 --> 00:34:04,251
The truth we later learned
from the Poughkeepsie tapes

459
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,666
was that this killer had carefully crafted

460
00:34:06,662 --> 00:34:08,710
the murder site to mislead us.

461
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:09,831
And it worked.

462
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,379
Funny thing is, to be able
to murder and mutilate a body

463
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:18,758
in such a way and to maintain
composure while doing so,

464
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:21,886
coupled with his bizarre
sense of theatricality,

465
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:26,015
you know, the masks and
costumes and whatnot,

466
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:29,814
shows that this man is
extremely mentally ill.

467
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,778
Comedia del arte is a form of theater

468
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,523
that dates back to 16th century Italy.

469
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:36,321
They actually had to
pass a law prohibiting

470
00:34:36,316 --> 00:34:39,035
carrying weapons while wearing a mask,

471
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:41,871
because people stopped being
responsible for their actions

472
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:43,331
the moment they put one on.

473
00:34:43,323 --> 00:34:45,542
I think the costumes
serve two functions.

474
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:49,084
First, they let him draw
out the act of killing.

475
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:52,333
And second, they help him to
alleviate any sense of guilt

476
00:34:52,332 --> 00:34:55,632
or regret he may have for the
horrible things he's doing.

477
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:58,176
This character went out of
fashion hundreds of years ago.

478
00:34:58,171 --> 00:35:01,721
It's the character Dottore Peste.

479
00:35:01,717 --> 00:35:03,765
The Doctor of the Plague.

480
00:35:09,766 --> 00:35:11,768
(Cheryl whimpering)

481
00:35:11,768 --> 00:35:13,896
[Ed] Why are you crying?

482
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:17,316
'Cause I want my mom.

483
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:20,156
I want my mom.

484
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:23,031
[Ed] Didn't I tell you?

485
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,872
What?

486
00:35:23,864 --> 00:35:26,492
[Ed] I killed your mom.

487
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,710
I killed your whole family.

488
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:31,830
I'm all you have left.

489
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,457
No, no you didn't.

490
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,130
[Ed] You tell me!

491
00:35:37,419 --> 00:35:41,344
Tell me you're happy I killed your family.

492
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,466
[Cheryl] No!

493
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,977
[Ed] What?

494
00:35:46,887 --> 00:35:48,013
[Cheryl] No.

495
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:49,973
No!

496
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:51,603
No!

497
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:56,022
(Cheryl screaming)

498
00:36:04,154 --> 00:36:04,950
Say it!

499
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:09,910
Say it!

500
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,752
What?

501
00:36:10,744 --> 00:36:11,836
What?

502
00:36:11,828 --> 00:36:14,877
You're happy I killed your parents!

503
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:23,177
Say it!

504
00:36:24,341 --> 00:36:26,469
(Cheryl panting)

505
00:36:26,468 --> 00:36:27,264
What?

506
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,063
I'm happy you killed my parents.

507
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:32,057
Say it again.

508
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,105
I'm happy you killed my parents.

509
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:36,820
You don't have parents.

510
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:38,155
You're a slave.

511
00:36:38,146 --> 00:36:41,070
(Cheryl crying)

512
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,192
I'll say it.

513
00:36:43,193 --> 00:36:44,410
Those people.

514
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:49,033
I'm happy that you killed them.

515
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:49,828
Why?

516
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:52,623
Why?

517
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:53,620
Why!

518
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,748
(Cheryl crying)

519
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:58,045
Because I don't like them!

520
00:37:00,877 --> 00:37:03,505
(Cheryl crying)

521
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,310
[Ed] Who do you like?

522
00:37:12,305 --> 00:37:13,522
[Cheryl] You.

523
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:15,434
[Ed] Who?

524
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:18,062
[Cheryl] Only you.

525
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:22,899
[Ed] Why?

526
00:37:24,526 --> 00:37:26,620
[Cheryl] Because you're the master,

527
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,080
and it please me to serve you.

528
00:37:32,909 --> 00:37:34,911
[Ed] Did you want me
to kill those people.

529
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:36,538
Yes.

530
00:37:36,538 --> 00:37:37,505
I don't know.

531
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:38,339
Yes!

532
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:39,173
I don't know!

533
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,008
Yes!

534
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,002
That's why I did it.

535
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:43,925
I did it because of you.

536
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,968
[Cheryl] Thank you Master!

537
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:46,760
Thank you!

538
00:37:48,008 --> 00:37:49,681
[Ed] Say it.

539
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:51,303
[Cheryl] You're the master.

540
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:54,022
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

541
00:37:57,851 --> 00:38:01,606
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

542
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:06,780
You're the master...

543
00:38:06,776 --> 00:38:09,620
(Cheryl mumbling)

544
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:11,911
People have come from as
far away as Lancaster County

545
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:15,332
to search the wooded area
around the Dempsey residence.

546
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,421
This in hopes of finding any clues

547
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:19,540
in the disappearance of
their daughter Cheryl.

548
00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:24,386
I'd just like to say to
the person who's done this,

549
00:38:24,377 --> 00:38:27,221
please bring my daughter back home.

550
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:43,481
[Ed] If there's
anything I can do to help,

551
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,027
please let me know.

552
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:47,029
Thanks.

553
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:53,160
Wait.

554
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:56,663
Wait.

555
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:58,961
Oh my god.

556
00:38:58,954 --> 00:39:02,333
(Ed chuckling)
Oh my god.

557
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:07,421
I play that moment in my
head over and over again.

558
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:11,467
I knew it was him, and I didn't stop him

559
00:39:11,466 --> 00:39:13,059
because I was scared.

560
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,770
(downbeat music)

561
00:39:26,815 --> 00:39:30,410
[Ed] Are you through screaming?

562
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:31,870
Do you need water?

563
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:55,219
If I take the gag off, will
you do something for me?

564
00:40:11,735 --> 00:40:13,863
I want you to put this on.

565
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:33,048
[Cheryl] You're the master
and it pleases me to serve you.

566
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:37,015
Pleases me to serve you.

567
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,184
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

568
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:46,566
(gentle downbeat music)

569
00:40:59,532 --> 00:41:02,160
By the summer of '93,
the area was really

570
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,505
starting to feel the
effects of this man's work.

571
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:07,875
Most killers getting
this much media attention

572
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:09,842
will do one of three things.

573
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,836
One, they will realize it's not safe

574
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:15,557
for a serial killer to work
that town anymore and leave.

575
00:41:15,548 --> 00:41:17,721
Two, they will give it a
rest for a little while

576
00:41:17,717 --> 00:41:19,845
and let it cool off.

577
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,562
Or three, they'll just keep doing it,

578
00:41:21,554 --> 00:41:23,648
maybe even speed of the
rate of their killings,

579
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,517
until they get caught.

580
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:29,192
But this killer did
something quite unique,

581
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,736
he kept killing, but changed his MO.

582
00:41:31,731 --> 00:41:34,701
(ominous music)

583
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,445
A third body was found here today.

584
00:41:36,444 --> 00:41:38,196
We're standing on the west bank

585
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:39,994
of the Hudson River in Poughkeepsie,

586
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:41,616
police believe this to be another killing

587
00:41:41,616 --> 00:41:44,495
by the man some are calling
the Water Street Butcher.

588
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:45,495
Sixth killing believed to be the work

589
00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:47,213
of the Water Street Butcher.

590
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,878
Police are warning local prostitutes

591
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,841
to stay off the streets.

592
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,107
[Prostitute] Wasn't me!

593
00:42:10,103 --> 00:42:13,073
(low ominous music)

594
00:42:14,315 --> 00:42:16,738
[Cheryl] You're the master
and it pleases me to serve you.

595
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:19,079
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

596
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,162
You're the master and it pleases--

597
00:42:23,158 --> 00:42:24,705
[Woman] This ain't right.

598
00:42:24,701 --> 00:42:27,204
[Cheryl] You're the master
and it pleases me to serve you.

599
00:42:27,203 --> 00:42:28,876
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

600
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,464
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

601
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:38,594
At around the same time we started

602
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:42,311
getting word from the
prostitutes that worked that area

603
00:42:42,302 --> 00:42:44,179
that girls are getting arrested

604
00:42:44,179 --> 00:42:46,352
and never being heard from again.

605
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:47,815
[Prostitute] You can't just arrest me!

606
00:42:47,807 --> 00:42:49,275
You can't arrest me!

607
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:52,237
(low ominous music)

608
00:42:53,855 --> 00:42:55,072
[Woman] Will you help me?

609
00:42:55,064 --> 00:42:56,407
[Cheryl] No.

610
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:58,493
[Woman] Please, I, come on!

611
00:42:58,485 --> 00:43:01,409
[Cheryl] No, no, he won't like it.

612
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:03,657
[Woman] If I'm with
you, he can't stop you.

613
00:43:03,656 --> 00:43:04,498
[Cheryl] He won't like it.

614
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:05,333
(woman screaming)

615
00:43:05,325 --> 00:43:06,702
No, no, no, no!

616
00:43:08,912 --> 00:43:09,708
No!

617
00:43:11,164 --> 00:43:14,885
(woman screaming and crying)

618
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,508
No, no, no, please!

619
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:20,340
Please no!

620
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,136
No, no!

621
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:25,682
Please no!

622
00:43:25,678 --> 00:43:27,055
Oh no, oh no, no!

623
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:32,482
(woman screaming)

624
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:33,444
[Ed] Now you.

625
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:34,858
[Cheryl] No, she was trying to escape--

626
00:43:34,854 --> 00:43:38,779
(Ed screaming)
(Cheryl crying)

627
00:43:38,775 --> 00:43:39,822
No I didn't!

628
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:40,614
I didn't!

629
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:46,200
(Cheryl screaming)

630
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:50,916
[Ed] Okay.

631
00:43:50,912 --> 00:43:52,880
This is your punishment.

632
00:43:53,832 --> 00:43:56,460
(Cheryl crying)

633
00:44:24,946 --> 00:44:27,745
All of the victim's
bodies had been mutilated.

634
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,290
In part to cover up
the bite marks on them.

635
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:36,717
They all had been sliced
from mouth to ear,

636
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:39,928
and they had been raped postmortem.

637
00:44:39,919 --> 00:44:44,049
And we found matching sperm
on four of the bodies.

638
00:44:45,508 --> 00:44:48,808
Years ago, I was
granted the dubious honor

639
00:44:48,803 --> 00:44:52,478
of interviewing Theodore Robert Bundy

640
00:44:52,473 --> 00:44:55,067
in connection with another case.

641
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:59,189
But the insight that I gained
there is relevant here.

642
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:03,869
I remember the first question
he asked me was, did he--

643
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,736
Rape her?

644
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,289
[Mike] Ah, yes he did.

645
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:09,749
Before or after?

646
00:45:11,993 --> 00:45:14,212
[Mike] Before or after what?

647
00:45:14,203 --> 00:45:16,171
You know, killing her.

648
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:19,793
[Mike] After.

649
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:23,922
You see Mike, I think that's
an important distinction.

650
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:28,143
This might all sound a little weird but

651
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:31,646
the kill and rape variety,

652
00:45:31,638 --> 00:45:34,482
these guys will continue
to have sex with the body

653
00:45:34,474 --> 00:45:38,900
way past the point where
we thought possible.

654
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:43,321
Mild decomposition,
even maggots and things,

655
00:45:43,316 --> 00:45:45,785
may just serve to turn him on.

656
00:45:47,028 --> 00:45:50,658
Next time you find a fresh dump site,

657
00:45:50,657 --> 00:45:52,500
keep quiet about it.

658
00:45:52,492 --> 00:45:53,539
Stake it out.

659
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:56,754
Your guy'll come back to it.

660
00:45:56,746 --> 00:46:00,546
Unfortunately, we have never
found a fresh enough body.

661
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:03,294
But there was evidence that he had

662
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:07,424
in fact been returning to
them, for sexual reasons.

663
00:46:29,237 --> 00:46:31,660
Hi, we're selling cookies.

664
00:46:31,656 --> 00:46:33,499
Would you like to buy some?

665
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:34,458
[Ed] Uh...

666
00:46:35,952 --> 00:46:37,545
Sure.

667
00:46:37,537 --> 00:46:39,790
Sure, why don't you come in.

668
00:46:41,624 --> 00:46:44,343
Um, we're not really supposed to.

669
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:46,429
[Ed] Well that's smart.

670
00:46:46,421 --> 00:46:49,015
You know, there's a lot
of weirdos out there,

671
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:51,806
but I'm a policeman, so it's okay.

672
00:46:53,553 --> 00:46:54,395
<i>_</i> okay.

673
00:46:54,387 --> 00:46:55,639
[Ed] Okay.

674
00:46:55,638 --> 00:46:56,730
Come on in.

675
00:46:56,723 --> 00:46:59,693
(low ominous music)

676
00:47:06,774 --> 00:47:08,401
Just sit right there.

677
00:47:08,401 --> 00:47:09,527
[Girl] Okay.

678
00:47:15,575 --> 00:47:16,872
[Ed] Okay.

679
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:18,745
Hey, you girls want some Cokes?

680
00:47:18,745 --> 00:47:19,667
Sure.

681
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:20,914
- Yeah?
- Okay.

682
00:47:20,913 --> 00:47:21,880
[Ed] Okay.

683
00:47:28,421 --> 00:47:29,388
Thank you.

684
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:39,900
[Ed] Hey, did you ride
your bikes here today?

685
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:42,440
No, I live over on Dupont.

686
00:47:42,435 --> 00:47:44,813
[Ed] Oh, so you live
in the neighborhood?

687
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:45,563
Yeah.

688
00:47:47,023 --> 00:47:47,945
I don't.

689
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,659
I live over by Central.

690
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:52,449
[Ed] Well, before you leave,

691
00:47:52,445 --> 00:47:55,574
do you tell your parents where you go?

692
00:47:56,699 --> 00:47:57,791
Sometimes.

693
00:47:57,784 --> 00:47:58,785
Yeah.

694
00:47:58,785 --> 00:47:59,752
[Ed] Yeah.

695
00:48:02,997 --> 00:48:04,795
(woman screaming distantly)

696
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:06,464
What's that?

697
00:48:06,459 --> 00:48:07,426
[Ed] What?

698
00:48:08,544 --> 00:48:10,262
I thought I heard something.

699
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:14,134
[Ed] Oh, well I left
the TV on in the basement.

700
00:48:14,133 --> 00:48:15,601
Oh.

701
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:18,563
(woman groaning)

702
00:48:18,554 --> 00:48:20,181
[Ed] You know, it sounds like I'm not

703
00:48:20,181 --> 00:48:23,355
going to be able to get cookies today.

704
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:26,776
You know, I get a raccoon
in the basement sometimes.

705
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:29,945
There's no raccoons around here.

706
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:31,989
[Ed] Sure there are.

707
00:48:31,984 --> 00:48:36,785
Hey, do you wanna see the
raccoon I got in the basement?

708
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:37,577
Sure.

709
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:40,827
[Ed] He's awful mean.

710
00:48:40,827 --> 00:48:42,625
I don't believe you.

711
00:48:43,538 --> 00:48:44,585
I wanna go.

712
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:50,382
[Ed] You know I'll have to
get cookies some other day.

713
00:48:50,378 --> 00:48:53,097
Why don't you let yourselves out?

714
00:48:58,136 --> 00:48:59,934
[Girl] Mark him off.

715
00:49:15,611 --> 00:49:18,160
[Ed] Sounds like something
got loose down there.

716
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:20,250
[Cheryl] I'm sorry Master,
I thought that it was tight.

717
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:22,289
[Ed] You felt pity for it.

718
00:49:22,285 --> 00:49:23,582
You tried to let it go.

719
00:49:23,578 --> 00:49:24,921
[Cheryl] No, no Master.

720
00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:26,380
I would never betray you.

721
00:49:26,372 --> 00:49:28,420
[Ed] This is your fault.

722
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:29,633
[Cheryl] No.

723
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:32,253
(Cheryl crying)

724
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:43,473
(Ed shouting)
(distant crashing)

725
00:49:47,268 --> 00:49:49,362
Suddenly, we had 10 bodies.

726
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:53,859
Six of whom had matching
samples of semen on them.

727
00:49:53,858 --> 00:49:55,576
Then we had a breakthrough.

728
00:49:55,568 --> 00:49:57,195
At one of the victim's apartments,

729
00:49:57,195 --> 00:50:00,870
we found an unwashed glass of water.

730
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:04,586
It had a fingerprint
and DNA from the saliva.

731
00:50:05,745 --> 00:50:08,669
We ran the prints we
found on the glass of water.

732
00:50:08,664 --> 00:50:11,508
It came back with a match.

733
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,174
It matched my partner, Jim Foley.

734
00:50:15,254 --> 00:50:18,258
They placed him under arrest
and started building a case.

735
00:50:18,257 --> 00:50:20,476
He had been in town
for all those killings,

736
00:50:20,468 --> 00:50:22,721
and there were three
killings in Pennsylvania

737
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,097
that matched the same MO,

738
00:50:24,096 --> 00:50:28,351
and he had been in Pennsylvania
on family vacation.

739
00:50:28,351 --> 00:50:31,821
He had no substantiated
alibi for any of the murders.

740
00:50:31,812 --> 00:50:33,564
We searched his car and his house

741
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:38,035
and found jewelry and bloodstains
that matched the victims.

742
00:50:38,027 --> 00:50:40,906
That point, we knew we had our man.

743
00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:43,624
(downbeat music)

744
00:50:57,296 --> 00:50:59,924
When they came and arrested my dad

745
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:02,803
as the Water street
Butcher, it was devastating.

746
00:51:02,802 --> 00:51:06,147
I couldn't sleep, I dropped out of school,

747
00:51:06,138 --> 00:51:09,392
I became a freak even to my own friends.

748
00:51:09,392 --> 00:51:11,645
Everything changed in one second.

749
00:51:11,644 --> 00:51:13,988
Foley had no alibi for these murders

750
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,359
because he was a cop who
rode in an unmarked cruiser

751
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:19,486
by himself most of the time.

752
00:51:19,485 --> 00:51:23,115
There was plenty of time for
him to commit these crimes.

753
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:26,163
Secondly, he had a history
of getting prostitutes.

754
00:51:26,158 --> 00:51:30,254
Apparently Mr. Foley was
a fairly regular customer.

755
00:51:30,246 --> 00:51:33,591
One of the prostitutes,
Cindy Jackson, took the stand

756
00:51:33,582 --> 00:51:35,004
and placed him in the neighborhood

757
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:38,631
at the time of three of the abductions.

758
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:40,427
As defense, my hands were really tied

759
00:51:40,423 --> 00:51:43,597
because he kept refusing a
plea bargain of any kind.

760
00:51:43,592 --> 00:51:45,265
I kept telling him, Jim,

761
00:51:45,261 --> 00:51:48,140
they're gonna kill you
if you don't cop a plea.

762
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:50,392
He kept telling me that he'd fire me

763
00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:53,736
and defend himself if I
didn't shut up about it.

764
00:51:53,728 --> 00:51:56,072
It was really quite frustrating.

765
00:51:56,063 --> 00:51:58,782
(downbeat music)

766
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:09,706
He was my father.

767
00:52:12,455 --> 00:52:16,005
Now it's over and he needs to be punished.

768
00:52:23,716 --> 00:52:25,935
But I think that your
life should be spared,

769
00:52:25,926 --> 00:52:28,429
because we are not like you.

770
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:31,148
(downbeat music)

771
00:52:35,561 --> 00:52:37,780
[Cheryl] You're the master
and it pleases me to serve you.

772
00:52:37,772 --> 00:52:39,945
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

773
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:44,116
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

774
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:48,874
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

775
00:52:50,785 --> 00:52:52,879
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

776
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:57,208
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

777
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,837
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

778
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,132
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

779
00:53:06,008 --> 00:53:08,602
You're the master and it
pleases me to serve you.

780
00:53:08,594 --> 00:53:10,767
The governor has not granted reprieve,

781
00:53:10,763 --> 00:53:14,484
James Foley will be
executed within the hour.

782
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

783
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:23,325
(disjointed music)

784
00:53:23,317 --> 00:53:26,036
(downbeat music)

785
00:53:44,547 --> 00:53:46,015
[Man] Two members of the execution team

786
00:53:46,006 --> 00:53:48,725
are preparing their injections.

787
00:53:48,717 --> 00:53:50,594
A third is standing by.

788
00:53:59,728 --> 00:54:01,696
The superintendent will
now give the condemned

789
00:54:01,689 --> 00:54:04,738
the opportunity to make a last statement.

790
00:54:04,733 --> 00:54:07,828
He has declined to make a last statement.

791
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,699
(woman whimpering)

792
00:54:14,368 --> 00:54:18,339
He's afforded the opportunity for prayer.

793
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:21,049
The condemned has declined this also.

794
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:23,760
(downbeat music)

795
00:54:36,557 --> 00:54:40,687
We have now completed the
first phase of the execution.

796
00:54:42,688 --> 00:54:46,818
We have now completed the
second phase of the execution.

797
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,571
We have now completed the third

798
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:52,289
and final phase of the execution.

799
00:54:57,244 --> 00:55:01,715
One of the physicians is
now making his examination.

800
00:55:01,707 --> 00:55:04,711
Now the second is making his check.

801
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:08,806
Now the third and final
physician is making his check.

802
00:55:08,797 --> 00:55:10,799
Examination is completed.

803
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,801
The superintendent has
advised the witnesses

804
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:16,601
that death did occur
at 12:24 on this date.

805
00:55:16,597 --> 00:55:19,225
(ominous music)

806
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,959
When I got home, I
found a map in my mailbox.

807
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:48,262
There was a mark on it
that said, "Missed one."

808
00:55:48,254 --> 00:55:49,756
And then my phone rang.

809
00:55:49,755 --> 00:55:52,349
They said you gotta get
down here and see this.

810
00:55:52,341 --> 00:55:53,638
It was another body.

811
00:55:53,634 --> 00:55:55,307
I knew right away.

812
00:55:55,302 --> 00:55:58,476
[Reporter] Death by lethal injection.

813
00:55:58,472 --> 00:56:00,315
After three stays of execution,

814
00:56:00,307 --> 00:56:02,355
the death warrant has now been issued,

815
00:56:02,351 --> 00:56:05,901
and James Foley will be put
to death within the hour.

816
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:09,617
In 1996, a jury convicted
and sentenced Foley to death

817
00:56:09,608 --> 00:56:11,030
for the brutal murders of four women

818
00:56:11,026 --> 00:56:13,449
in Pennsylvania and Upstate New York.

819
00:56:13,445 --> 00:56:16,289
Authorities believe the
death toll to be much higher.

820
00:56:16,282 --> 00:56:18,876
[Woman] We need to
stop killing everyone.

821
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:20,460
And if the government sanctions it

822
00:56:20,452 --> 00:56:23,456
it just gives everyone a taste for blood.

823
00:56:23,455 --> 00:56:25,924
[Reporter] Pennsylvania's
third execution in 25 years.

824
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:27,714
Right after I go work,

825
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:31,556
police come in and handing me DNA sample,

826
00:56:31,547 --> 00:56:34,346
and demanding I do immediate.

827
00:56:34,341 --> 00:56:36,639
I was very stressful.

828
00:56:36,635 --> 00:56:40,765
And it turn out same as Water
Street Butcher, James Foley.

829
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:43,434
We're still not sure.

830
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,186
Apparently he had gone
to a fertility clinic

831
00:56:45,185 --> 00:56:49,782
some years before, we
think maybe that's how.

832
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:51,650
But we're still not sure.

833
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:54,699
Three days after my dad's execution,

834
00:56:54,695 --> 00:56:57,915
they realize that he had been innocent.

835
00:56:57,906 --> 00:57:00,204
They were gonna put out a thing
in the paper the next day,

836
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,124
and then 9/11 happened.

837
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,250
So, the article on clad gets
bumped down to page six.

838
00:57:08,584 --> 00:57:12,384
Former cop cleared of
charges after execution.

839
00:57:13,339 --> 00:57:16,593
People still jokingly when
I say my name they'll ask,

840
00:57:16,592 --> 00:57:19,596
any relation to the Water Street Butcher?

841
00:57:19,595 --> 00:57:23,520
And I tell them, Jim Foley
wasn't the Water Street Butcher.

842
00:57:23,515 --> 00:57:27,645
Nobody heard that they found
him innocent, 'cause of 9/11.

843
00:57:28,896 --> 00:57:30,773
Any other week in American history

844
00:57:30,773 --> 00:57:33,401
and this would've been a
serious national sensation.

845
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,121
Serial killer kills cop
using justice system.

846
00:57:38,739 --> 00:57:40,207
Come on.

847
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:42,543
But then September 11th happened,

848
00:57:42,534 --> 00:57:46,414
and no one gave a shit
about anything else.

849
00:57:46,413 --> 00:57:48,211
You know, after 10 or more years

850
00:57:48,207 --> 00:57:51,711
of planning and executing
what I considered to be

851
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:56,056
the crime of the century,
nobody even heard about it.

852
00:57:56,048 --> 00:58:00,178
See, when people read there's
a serial killer in town,

853
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:04,808
their guards go up, which was happening.

854
00:58:04,807 --> 00:58:06,400
But then when they read the serial killer

855
00:58:06,392 --> 00:58:10,363
only preys on prostitutes,
if you're not a prostitute,

856
00:58:10,354 --> 00:58:13,153
your defenses are going to go back down.

857
00:58:13,148 --> 00:58:16,994
So he created this Water
Street Butcher persona

858
00:58:16,985 --> 00:58:21,081
to assuage people's fears
about this unknown killer.

859
00:58:21,073 --> 00:58:25,203
So that he could continue
to prey on everyone else.

860
00:58:28,455 --> 00:58:29,297
- Hi.
- Hi,

861
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:30,211
you having some car trouble?

862
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:32,460
[Woman] Oh yeah, my car just died.

863
00:58:32,459 --> 00:58:33,551
I don't know what's wrong with it.

864
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:35,421
[Ed] Oh, you need me
to call you a tow truck?

865
00:58:35,421 --> 00:58:36,923
Oh, Officer, thank you.

866
00:58:36,922 --> 00:58:38,640
That would be great.

867
00:58:38,632 --> 00:58:40,054
I've been stuck here for over an hour.

868
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,927
[Ed] You know, you really
shouldn't be out here

869
00:58:41,927 --> 00:58:43,645
by yourself with that Water Street Butcher

870
00:58:43,637 --> 00:58:45,355
on the loose and all.

871
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:49,852
[Woman] I thought he
just attacked prostitutes?

872
00:58:49,852 --> 00:58:51,149
[Ed] Hey, look, there's a gas station

873
00:58:51,145 --> 00:58:53,193
a mile down where you'll be safe.

874
00:58:53,188 --> 00:58:54,360
Let me drop you there,

875
00:58:54,356 --> 00:58:57,075
then you won't have to
wait out here alone.

876
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:58,819
[Woman] You wouldn't mind?

877
00:58:58,819 --> 00:58:59,786
[Ed] Not at all.

878
00:58:59,778 --> 00:59:01,906
[Woman] Oh, thank you, okay.

879
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,657
[Ed] I have a lot of stuff up here,

880
00:59:03,657 --> 00:59:06,877
would you mind jumping into the back?

881
00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:08,667
Sure, sure, why not.

882
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:16,715
Thank you.

883
00:59:21,341 --> 00:59:24,436
This is what it looks
like to be arrested, huh?

884
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:26,351
[Ed] Hey, you ever been arrested?

885
00:59:26,346 --> 00:59:28,519
(laughing)

886
00:59:28,515 --> 00:59:31,860
Not that I care to admit to.

887
00:59:31,852 --> 00:59:35,948
I once got arrested for drinking
underage, but that's it.

888
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:49,586
Wow, I've had such a long day.

889
01:00:01,423 --> 01:00:05,053
I think, I think that was
the exit to the gas station.

890
01:00:05,052 --> 01:00:09,353
Excuse me, wasn't that the
exit to the gas station?

891
01:00:09,348 --> 01:00:11,146
[Ed] I guess it was.

892
01:00:15,354 --> 01:00:16,526
Perhaps you better turn around.

893
01:00:16,522 --> 01:00:20,026
[Ed] You know, can I ask you something?

894
01:00:20,025 --> 01:00:20,947
What?

895
01:00:20,943 --> 01:00:22,160
Would you please turn around?

896
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:24,120
[Ed] Why did you call me Officer?

897
01:00:24,112 --> 01:00:25,238
Sorry, what do you mean?

898
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:26,707
[Ed] Well, before you got into the car,

899
01:00:26,698 --> 01:00:29,326
you called me Officer.

900
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:31,499
Why did you call me that?

901
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:35,216
I thought police liked it
when you called them that.

902
01:00:35,207 --> 01:00:36,800
[Ed] Well, they do.

903
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:38,089
But I'm not cop.

904
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:42,005
You're not?

905
01:00:42,923 --> 01:00:43,719
[Ed] No.

906
01:00:46,301 --> 01:00:48,770
That's not very funny.

907
01:00:48,762 --> 01:00:51,561
[Ed] Well, I'm not trying to be.

908
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:02,776
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

909
01:01:02,776 --> 01:01:04,244
What are you then?

910
01:01:05,279 --> 01:01:06,997
[Ed] I'm a butcher.

911
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,344
That's not funny.

912
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:27,263
[Ed] Yeah, no, it's not.

913
01:01:27,259 --> 01:01:30,433
You shouldn't get into stranger's cars.

914
01:01:34,308 --> 01:01:35,651
You're not a cop?

915
01:01:35,642 --> 01:01:37,895
[Ed] Didn't you learn about assumptions?

916
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:40,273
They make an ass of u and me.

917
01:01:46,653 --> 01:01:48,530
Where are you going?

918
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:49,998
[Ed] You'll see.

919
01:01:58,832 --> 01:02:00,209
Please don't do this.

920
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:01,050
Sir?

921
01:02:01,043 --> 01:02:02,169
Please don't hurt me.

922
01:02:02,169 --> 01:02:03,341
I'm...

923
01:02:03,337 --> 01:02:05,931
I'm, I'm a good person, I have a family,

924
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,766
and they'll tell someone I'm missing.

925
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:10,602
I'm so sorry, perhaps I
made you want to do this--

926
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:12,141
[Ed] Well how about
this, I'll make you a deal.

927
01:02:12,137 --> 01:02:12,979
Yeah?

928
01:02:12,971 --> 01:02:16,191
[Ed] We'll pull over,
and I'm gonna rape you.

929
01:02:16,183 --> 01:02:19,813
But then, then if you've been good,

930
01:02:19,811 --> 01:02:23,941
and you haven't done anything
stupid, I won't kill you.

931
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:28,407
Okay.

932
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:32,495
[Ed] You think I'd fall for that?

933
01:02:32,491 --> 01:02:34,869
You're not just gonna let me rape you.

934
01:02:34,868 --> 01:02:35,869
Yes I am.

935
01:02:35,869 --> 01:02:38,088
[Ed] I don't believe you.

936
01:02:39,831 --> 01:02:40,627
Why?

937
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,930
[Ed] You know, to be perfectly honest,

938
01:02:50,926 --> 01:02:53,304
I don't think either of us
are gonna want you alive

939
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:56,432
for the things I'm going to do to you.

940
01:02:59,434 --> 01:03:02,233
(woman screaming)

941
01:03:05,732 --> 01:03:07,109
[Woman] I'm so sorry!

942
01:03:07,109 --> 01:03:08,110
Please, let me...

943
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:09,657
(woman screaming)
Obviously I wouldn't

944
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:11,701
leave handles on the doors.

945
01:03:11,697 --> 01:03:14,496
(woman screaming)

946
01:03:24,543 --> 01:03:26,887
[Woman] Somebody help me!

947
01:03:26,878 --> 01:03:27,674
Help me!

948
01:03:31,091 --> 01:03:33,344
Oh my god, somebody help me!

949
01:03:37,055 --> 01:03:37,851
No!

950
01:03:38,765 --> 01:03:41,564
(woman screaming)

951
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:47,240
Help me!

952
01:03:47,232 --> 01:03:48,905
Somebody help me!

953
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,699
(woman screaming)

954
01:03:53,864 --> 01:03:57,334
(static hiss building)

955
01:03:57,325 --> 01:04:00,374
(low rumbling music)

956
01:04:01,496 --> 01:04:05,626
(dramatic frightening music)
(woman whimpering)

957
01:05:29,209 --> 01:05:31,928
(woman groaning)

958
01:05:52,732 --> 01:05:56,612
This killer knows
how to play the profile

959
01:05:56,611 --> 01:05:59,740
in exactly the way he wants,

960
01:05:59,739 --> 01:06:02,083
just like a really good actor

961
01:06:02,075 --> 01:06:06,922
can make you think they're
really crying, or laughing.

962
01:06:06,913 --> 01:06:08,881
To give you an example of what I mean,

963
01:06:08,874 --> 01:06:12,003
let me read a couple of these profiles.

964
01:06:14,212 --> 01:06:17,762
Suspect is a white male, age 18 to 25.

965
01:06:17,757 --> 01:06:20,135
White male, age 25 to 35.

966
01:06:20,135 --> 01:06:22,763
Black male, age 25 to 30.

967
01:06:22,762 --> 01:06:24,605
Disorganized, highly organized.

968
01:06:24,598 --> 01:06:27,272
Serial killer, most likely
his first time killing.

969
01:06:27,267 --> 01:06:29,861
First killing, definitely
not his first killing.

970
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:32,402
Lives alone, probably
in a very messy house.

971
01:06:32,397 --> 01:06:34,274
His home will be clean and kempt.

972
01:06:34,274 --> 01:06:36,572
Sadist, sadistic, sadist.

973
01:06:36,568 --> 01:06:38,491
Has most likely been institutionalized

974
01:06:38,486 --> 01:06:40,284
for a good portion of his life.

975
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:42,783
Highly functional, may
have limited faculties.

976
01:06:42,782 --> 01:06:45,205
Highly intelligent,
probably highly educated.

977
01:06:45,202 --> 01:06:46,670
Most likely never finished high school.

978
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:49,005
Most likely works in law enforcement,

979
01:06:48,997 --> 01:06:51,796
possibly a police officer
or a security guard.

980
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:54,214
Probably lives off some
sort of disability.

981
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:55,633
Most likely cannot hold a job.

982
01:06:55,629 --> 01:07:00,351
Knows profiling, and may be
employed as an FBI profiler.

983
01:07:00,342 --> 01:07:01,389
(Sighs)

984
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:04,137
(downbeat music)

985
01:07:12,354 --> 01:07:15,107
I went back to the map
that the killer had sent me.

986
01:07:15,106 --> 01:07:17,734
It was made online using MapQuest.

987
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:19,202
So I put in a call to the FBI

988
01:07:19,194 --> 01:07:21,447
to see what we could get from this.

989
01:07:21,446 --> 01:07:23,699
They got the records from MapQuest,

990
01:07:23,698 --> 01:07:25,621
and only one download was made

991
01:07:25,617 --> 01:07:29,793
from that exact map during
the month in question.

992
01:07:29,788 --> 01:07:32,132
My name is Captain Harvey Scroggs.

993
01:07:32,123 --> 01:07:33,875
I lead the assault on the house.

994
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:38,005
As I like to say, we dropped
the whole hammer on him.

995
01:07:39,172 --> 01:07:43,143
Helicopters, SWAT, clogs,
bomb squad, everything.

996
01:07:45,136 --> 01:07:46,183
Just in case.

997
01:07:47,681 --> 01:07:51,276
(helicopter rotor whirring)

998
01:08:05,407 --> 01:08:06,249
[Officer] It's clear!

999
01:08:06,241 --> 01:08:07,083
- Clear.
- Clear.

1000
01:08:07,075 --> 01:08:08,543
[Officer] Clear.

1001
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:13,752
- Clear.
- Clear.

1002
01:08:13,748 --> 01:08:14,715
[Officer] All clear.

1003
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:17,427
People ask me how we found him,

1004
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:21,970
and I say, first, we didn't find him.

1005
01:08:21,965 --> 01:08:23,262
Just this house.

1006
01:08:23,258 --> 01:08:27,229
And second, we didn't
find it, he gave it to us.

1007
01:08:28,763 --> 01:08:31,186
He wanted us to find it.

1008
01:08:31,182 --> 01:08:34,106
And that's further evidenced
by the fact that there

1009
01:08:34,102 --> 01:08:38,232
was not one single fingerprint
in the entire house.

1010
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:43,825
Over here on the wall, got
a little bit of blood here.

1011
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:46,915
And here, point the camera
down Sean, point it down.

1012
01:08:46,906 --> 01:08:50,331
Got one, two, three, four,
five boxes of videotapes

1013
01:08:50,327 --> 01:08:51,920
numbered sequentially--

1014
01:08:51,911 --> 01:08:53,037
[Officer] Hey guys.

1015
01:08:53,038 --> 01:08:54,631
Hey guys, come here.

1016
01:08:54,622 --> 01:08:56,249
Come on.

1017
01:08:58,293 --> 01:08:59,510
[Agent] Whoa.

1018
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,047
Get in here Sean.

1019
01:09:02,047 --> 01:09:03,390
Get over here.

1020
01:09:03,381 --> 01:09:04,177
Over here.

1021
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,552
Ready?

1022
01:09:06,551 --> 01:09:07,347
Go.

1023
01:09:10,472 --> 01:09:11,268
My god.

1024
01:09:12,474 --> 01:09:14,522
[Officer] Is she alive?

1025
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:17,779
[Agent] Oh my god she is.

1026
01:09:17,771 --> 01:09:18,647
We need a medic in here.

1027
01:09:18,646 --> 01:09:20,694
Get a medic in here now!

1028
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:23,990
(gentle downbeat music)

1029
01:09:27,989 --> 01:09:29,582
Oh, people kept trying to tell me

1030
01:09:29,574 --> 01:09:33,374
all those years that
Cheryl was probably dead.

1031
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:36,670
That I should probably start to move on.

1032
01:09:38,124 --> 01:09:39,967
But I wouldn't.

1033
01:09:39,959 --> 01:09:44,089
I kep telling everyone, I have
to keep hope until I know.

1034
01:09:46,758 --> 01:09:49,352
But then I got the call.

1035
01:09:49,344 --> 01:09:52,644
The officer said, we found your daughter.

1036
01:09:52,639 --> 01:09:55,267
And I thought he meant her body.

1037
01:09:58,144 --> 01:10:01,193
I have never seen a human being

1038
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:04,409
born and raised in the United States

1039
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:07,405
show evidence of this kind of torture.

1040
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:09,406
She had been burned, cut,

1041
01:10:09,406 --> 01:10:14,253
she had five teeth removed
by pliers or a hammer.

1042
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:15,917
She had multiple broken bones.

1043
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:18,916
Not only that none of them
have been allowed to heal,

1044
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:21,134
some have been further aggravated

1045
01:10:21,126 --> 01:10:24,630
by some sort of tightening apparatus.

1046
01:10:24,629 --> 01:10:28,759
She had also been extremely malnourished,

1047
01:10:28,758 --> 01:10:32,854
and her organs were in
really bad shape as a result.

1048
01:10:32,846 --> 01:10:35,895
There also was severe sexual torture.

1049
01:10:37,183 --> 01:10:41,438
Including things like
electrocution of genitals,

1050
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:45,443
and things that are too
horrible to say out loud.

1051
01:10:53,158 --> 01:10:55,081
While she was in the hospital,

1052
01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:58,000
a lot of her injuries seemed
to get worse instead of better,

1053
01:10:57,996 --> 01:11:00,294
and we couldn't figure it out.

1054
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:03,965
Then I realized that pain, not
just pain, but brutal pain,

1055
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,213
had been such a huge part
of her life for so long

1056
01:11:06,212 --> 01:11:08,510
she didn't know how to exist without it.

1057
01:11:08,506 --> 01:11:11,134
She no longer knew how
to exist in the world

1058
01:11:11,134 --> 01:11:13,728
if not through horrific pain.

1059
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:17,441
She was torturing herself
when nobody was looking.

1060
01:11:17,432 --> 01:11:21,562
It was very strange, seeing
Cheryl after all that time.

1061
01:11:23,021 --> 01:11:24,443
You know, the time that she was missing,

1062
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:26,737
I went from being a carefree college girl

1063
01:11:26,733 --> 01:11:29,202
to having two girls of my own.

1064
01:11:30,778 --> 01:11:32,746
It was hard to see the girl that I loved

1065
01:11:32,739 --> 01:11:34,662
and the girl that came back.

1066
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,376
(downbeat music)

1067
01:12:00,725 --> 01:12:02,773
I don't know.

1068
01:12:02,769 --> 01:12:06,649
I don't know what you want me to say.

1069
01:12:06,648 --> 01:12:10,778
[Interviewer] Talk about what
it's like being home again.

1070
01:12:11,653 --> 01:12:13,655
I don't know.

1071
01:12:13,655 --> 01:12:15,874
What do you want me to say?

1072
01:12:17,075 --> 01:12:17,917
[Interviewer] It had to be nice

1073
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:19,536
seeing your mom again after all that time.

1074
01:12:19,536 --> 01:12:20,332
Yeah.

1075
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:23,456
Maybe.

1076
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:29,046
I don't know what you want me to say.

1077
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:29,887
[Interviewer] What was the man

1078
01:12:29,879 --> 01:12:32,849
you lived with all these years like?

1079
01:12:38,263 --> 01:12:39,264
I don't know.

1080
01:12:39,264 --> 01:12:42,234
I don't think that I
want to do this anymore.

1081
01:12:42,225 --> 01:12:43,772
[Interviewer] Why?

1082
01:12:43,768 --> 01:12:47,818
'Cause I don't know
what you want me to say.

1083
01:12:47,814 --> 01:12:51,614
[Interviewer] You can
say anything you want.

1084
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:55,029
He loved me.

1085
01:12:56,406 --> 01:12:59,785
Nobody ever lets me say it, but it's true.

1086
01:12:59,784 --> 01:13:00,751
He loved me.

1087
01:13:02,287 --> 01:13:04,915
He didn't mean to leave me.

1088
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:08,418
And someday he's gonna come back to me.

1089
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:10,716
And he's gonna take me away.

1090
01:13:14,632 --> 01:13:17,351
(downbeat music)

1091
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:51,757
Well, another tragedy for
this small family in Reading,

1092
01:13:51,753 --> 01:13:53,426
Take a look here at the crime scene.

1093
01:13:53,421 --> 01:13:55,594
The recently buried body of Cheryl Dempsey

1094
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:57,137
was stolen from her grave.

1095
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:59,886
It happened here last
night at Woodlawn Cemetery.

1096
01:13:59,886 --> 01:14:02,014
The only thing left
behind a broken casket.

1097
01:14:02,013 --> 01:14:03,481
As you can see, a real mess.

1098
01:14:03,473 --> 01:14:05,521
Police are now investigating
a possible link

1099
01:14:05,516 --> 01:14:08,269
between this demented
crime and a serial killer

1100
01:14:08,269 --> 01:14:10,363
who has been tormenting the East Coast

1101
01:14:10,355 --> 01:14:12,449
known as the Water Street Butcher.

1102
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:15,159
(downbeat music)

1103
01:14:20,615 --> 01:14:24,085
My feeling is that he's
moved somewhere else.

1104
01:14:24,077 --> 01:14:27,832
I doubt very strongly
that he's stopped killing.

1105
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:32,461
I doubt very strongly that
anyone even knows he's there.

1106
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,679
But in some town out there,

1107
01:14:36,047 --> 01:14:39,768
the disappearance and
murder rates are rising,

1108
01:14:39,759 --> 01:14:44,515
and somewhere out there
he's responsible for it.

1109
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:46,391
Something I find
interesting about these tapes

1110
01:14:46,391 --> 01:14:47,813
is that they're numbered sequentially,

1111
01:14:47,809 --> 01:14:51,939
but there were 27 tapes
missing when we found them.

1112
01:14:54,649 --> 01:14:57,823
I wonder what was on those tapes.

1113
01:14:57,819 --> 01:14:59,321
I wonder if they were just too private

1114
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,448
for him to let anyone see.

1115
01:15:03,074 --> 01:15:05,577
Or if his face was visible in those,

1116
01:15:05,576 --> 01:15:09,206
or if they revealed
just too much about him.

1117
01:15:11,249 --> 01:15:15,595
Or maybe they were worse than
anything that we've seen.

1118
01:15:15,586 --> 01:15:18,180
I'll tell you one
place we'll be watching.

1119
01:15:18,172 --> 01:15:20,015
If this documentary thing you're making

1120
01:15:20,007 --> 01:15:22,351
ever gets to the theaters,

1121
01:15:22,343 --> 01:15:25,438
he won't be able to help himself.

1122
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:29,151
He'll see this movie as
many times as he can.

1123
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:32,312
We'll keep an eye on as
many screenings as we can,

1124
01:15:32,311 --> 01:15:34,188
because he'll be there.

1125
01:15:35,148 --> 01:15:38,197
(low downbeat music)

1126
01:15:54,876 --> 01:15:57,595
(downbeat music)

1127
01:17:47,947 --> 01:17:51,292
(ominous music building)

1128
01:18:03,087 --> 01:18:06,307
(eerie downbeat music)

1129
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,728
(woman panting)

1130
01:20:24,603 --> 01:20:26,697
[Ed] I'll make you a deal.

1131
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:30,284
You can live as long as you don't blink.

1132
01:20:30,276 --> 01:20:34,031
(woman panting and screaming)
