Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:45,956
Edward!

3
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:55,048
- Pretorious!
- Go away!

4
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:59,469
No, listen to me. I've got to talk to you.
The resonator - it's working.

5
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,308
If this is your idea of a joke...

6
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,019
No, listen to me.
The new program - it worked.

7
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,604
Just like you said.

8
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,570
My God.

9
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:38,258
Do you feel it, Crawford?

10
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,116
Turn it off. Edward! Shut it off.

11
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,660
Never!

12
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,495
Can't you feel it?

13
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,831
Crawford! In the mind.

14
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,085
The mind!

15
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,337
It's out of control.
You've got to turn it off.

16
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,298
No! No!

17
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,425
No, I want to see more.

18
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,595
More than any man has ever seen.

19
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:28,183
Edward! It's running itself!

20
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,106
Something's...

21
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,442
coming.

22
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,783
They're at it again.

23
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,161
With the coloured lights
and the weird sounds.

24
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,621
Last time I called

25
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:53,208
you said you'd send a squad car
if there was another disturbance.

26
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,585
Well, I'm disturbed.

27
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,379
Hello?

28
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,506
Hello!

29
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,969
Bunny! Come back!

30
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,070
Bunny.

31
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,659
Bunny.

32
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,953
Oh, please.

33
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,112
Bunny.

34
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,867
Oh, Bunny.

35
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:14,206
- Bunny.
- Get back! It's out of control!

36
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:18,085
Edward! Turn it off! Edward!

37
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Here we are, you little sweetheart.

38
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,693
Somebody! Help!

39
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,584
Help! Help!

40
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,719
Hold it, fella!

41
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,682
Oh God!

42
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,851
Oh my God!

43
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,811
Come on! Come on!

44
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,022
Bunny!

45
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:57,846
Dr Bloch, I'm Jordan Fields from the DA's
office. This is Dr Katherine McMichaels.

46
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,055
Hello.

47
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,392
I've read some of your work.
Very... impressive.

48
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,186
Oh, yes. So is this facility.

49
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,939
Though if you've read my work...

50
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,568
you know I'm not in favor of
locking away schizophrenics.

51
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:16,323
Yes, I know. You're in favor of
using them in experiments, like...

52
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,407
lab animals.

53
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,454
We've asked Dr McMichaels
for her expert opinion

54
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,706
on the sanity of Crawford Tillinghast,

55
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:29,127
as it pertains to his ability to stand
trial for the murder of Edward Pretorious.

56
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,799
Thank you.

57
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,595
Just a minute. Ray?

58
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,191
Thank you.

59
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,651
And...

60
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,875
I'm sorry. I am.

61
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:13,963
I'm sorry.

62
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,050
May God in heaven...

63
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Get them out of here!
Get them out of here!

64
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,330
He's in here, doctor.

65
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,010
Crawford?

66
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,891
This is Dr Katherine McMichaels.

67
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,059
Hello.

68
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,814
I suppose you're another psychiatrist.

69
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,567
Yes, I am.

70
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,569
And you're a physicist.

71
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,033
Your record at Miskatonic University
was brilliant.

72
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,620
Oh yes. I had quite a future, didn't I?

73
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,249
Yes. You were working
with Edward Pretorious.

74
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:38,131
I was assisting Dr Pretorious
with his experiments, yes.

75
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,719
What was the purpose of the experiments?

76
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,475
To stimulate the pineal gland
with resonant vibrations.

77
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,435
The pineal gland? Why?

78
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,189
Dr Pretorious believed the pineal was
a dormant sensory organ.

79
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,776
- A sixth sense.
- Yes. Well, that's not a new theory.

80
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,487
The philosopher Descartes believed
it was the third eye.

81
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,447
It's not a theory. It's a fact.

82
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,491
Then your experiments worked.

83
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,202
They proved the theory.

84
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,041
Yes.

85
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,793
Then what went wrong?

86
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,089
Nothing, at first.

87
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,218
But then we saw them.

88
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,720
What did you see?

89
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,391
We saw creatures.

90
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,395
We saw creatures, these...

91
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:44,906
things that were swimming around
in the air and fill it all the time.

92
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,035
Are they around us now?

93
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,662
You bet.

94
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:55,166
Only we can't see them without
the resonator and they can't see us,

95
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,002
unless they're under the influence
of the vibrations.

96
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,421
That's why I had to destroy it.

97
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,923
Destroy what?

98
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,843
The resonator - Pretorious's invention.

99
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,515
Because...

100
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,268
it...

101
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,104
came.

102
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,647
What came?

103
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,485
Dr Tillinghast?

104
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,156
Crawford, what did you see?

105
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,451
It ate him.

106
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,039
Bit off his head.

107
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,880
Like a gingerbread man.

108
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,634
Crawford.

109
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,762
- Dr McMichaels.
- I'm not mad.

110
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,849
I saw it.

111
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,188
Do you hear me? I saw it.

112
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,191
- Why doesn't anyone believe me?
- We can't reach him.

113
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,736
He keeps returning to
the same fantasy.

114
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,487
Let's do a CAT scan on him.

115
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,408
Why? You've already seen everything
you need to see.

116
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,411
There's always more to see.

117
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,043
No machines, please.

118
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,586
No, it's all right.

119
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,171
You'll be all right.

120
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,176
I promise.

121
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,609
Oh God.

122
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,278
No. No. No!

123
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,740
No! No!

124
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,367
No!

125
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,037
No!

126
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,338
Oh my God!

127
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,382
There. Do you see that?

128
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:11,636
The pineal gland is oversized and
extending through the optic thalami.

129
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,222
Think the tumour is causing his delusions?

130
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,099
I don't think that's a tumour.

131
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,937
I think the pineal gland is growing.

132
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,190
- That's impossible.
- I know but the CAT scan bears it out.

133
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,068
The pineal stalk is elongating
through the brain.

134
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,405
Wait a minute.
I don't know from the inside of brains.

135
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,990
What does all this mean?

136
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,076
Well, it could mean that the experiment
they were performing

137
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,995
actually does stimulate the pineal.

138
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,163
You mean he's not crazy?

139
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,750
I don't know.

140
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,920
He actually believes that he saw
these creatures.

141
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:50,758
It still doesn't explain how Pretorious
died or what happened to his head.

142
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,513
I'd like to recreate their experiment

143
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,515
and I'll need Tillinghast to do it.

144
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,518
That is absurd and unethical.

145
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,564
I know your methods. The girl wonder.

146
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,568
You use your patients so you can make
your great discoveries.

147
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,195
At least here we try to cure them.

148
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,822
By locking them up?

149
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,783
Giving them drugs?
Taking their lives away?

150
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,828
I can give him his life back.

151
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,290
I'll give you an expert opinion.

152
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:26,544
Crawford Tillinghast is a classic
paranoid schizophrenic

153
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,755
and a dangerous one.

154
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,382
If I can recreate the experiment,

155
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,177
then I can find out
what happened to Pretorious.

156
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,016
I'd like nothing better than
to lock this guy up.

157
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,560
I've got a dead man
with his head twisted off,

158
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,938
covered in some shit
the pathologist can't even identify.

159
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,233
No other fingerprints found
except Tillinghast's,

160
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,445
no blood on the axe,
no blood anywhere.

161
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,949
I wanna know what the hell
happened up there.

162
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,248
He's all yours.

163
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,178
You're my patient now, Dr Tillinghast.

164
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,559
Thank you.

165
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,104
I'll call for an appointment.

166
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,147
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

167
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,734
You've been released into my custody.
You have to come with me.

168
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,653
Where do you plan on taking me?

169
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,322
Back to the Pretorious house.

170
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,366
I want you to recreate your experiment.

171
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,494
No.

172
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,748
Look... You can either stay here for the
rest of your life or you can come with me.

173
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,293
That's not much of a choice, is it?

174
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,839
I believe you, Crawford.

175
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,216
I wanna see what you saw.

176
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,150
Hi! You must be Doc McMichaels.

177
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,318
No. I'm Dr McMichaels.

178
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,112
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

179
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,613
Then you must be...

180
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,199
- This is Dr Crawford Tillinghast.
- The crazy.

181
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,373
I'm Sergeant Buford Brownlee but
my team mates call me Bubba.

182
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,834
I used to play pro football.

183
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,003
We were all crazy.

184
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,622
Not exactly cheery.

185
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,443
Sorry about that. Childproof lock.

186
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,196
Last stop. Everybody out.

187
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,336
Dr Tillinghast, would you care to
show us around?

188
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:48,973
Doctor, if you're telling us the truth,
the only way to free yourself

189
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:53,269
is to go back... through this door.

190
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,088
Come on, doc.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

191
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,091
Look, I'll show you.

192
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,447
See? What did I tell you?

193
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,908
Bubba, you all right?

194
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,618
Yeah, yeah. OK.

195
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,495
Electrical cables.

196
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:58,709
We needed more power so...
they rewired the whole house.

197
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,630
Where are the circuit breakers, doctor?

198
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,300
Doctor?

199
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,429
Tillinghast.

200
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,267
Damn! Have we lost him?

201
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,605
He knows this place better than we do.

202
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,192
First thing's to find the power.

203
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,377
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

204
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,255
I'll bet these cables lead
to the resonator.

205
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,133
First we find our missing mental patient.

206
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,194
I want more yelling.

207
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,374
This guy was into some weird shit.

208
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:25,296
Where's that mouth? I wanna kiss it.

209
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,424
That's him.

210
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,844
Dr Edward Pretorious.

211
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,478
I don't care about his private life.

212
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
The Pretorious resonator.
- Is that how you hacked up Pretorious?
- That's where I hit it.

213
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,301
I knocked a fork off.

214
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,719
There.

215
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,846
There it is.

216
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,473
What do you want me to do with him?

217
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,475
- Let him go.
- Are you crazy too?

218
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,436
He's reliving it - the night of
the murder. Let him go.

219
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,649
DA says you call the signals.

220
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:12,904
Yes.

221
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,955
This is how it was.

222
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:33,173
That's where it ate him.

223
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,092
Wait a minute. What ate who?

224
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,306
We can start in the morning, Crawford.

225
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,768
I've started.

226
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,478
All right.

227
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,445
All this talk about eating
is making me hungry.

228
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,697
How about we have some dinner?

229
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,870
The real danger here is starving.

230
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,979
Pretty, isn't she?

231
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,565
She is beautiful.

232
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,693
So how's it going, doc?

233
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,529
Need some help?

234
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,365
He used to bring beautiful women here.

235
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:28,163
They'd eat fine meals, drink fine wine,
listen to music.

236
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,585
But it always ended with screaming.

237
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,509
And I would just lie there
and listen to them.

238
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,763
Screaming.

239
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,058
Your boss had some screws loose.

240
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,935
He was a genius.

241
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:57,109
It's just that the five senses weren't
enough for him. He wanted more.

242
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,950
Is it finished? Are we ready?

243
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,119
Yes.

244
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,208
I...

245
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,754
had to bypass the computer

246
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,965
because the magnetic field
erased the program.

247
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,927
And of course the monitor's
completely useless

248
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:29,349
so the entire system has to be
manually operated.

249
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:33,103
And unfortunately the resonator was
so severely damaged

250
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,899
that I had to convert it to
just an on-off system.

251
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:41,320
When we reach 20,000 MHz,
we throw this switch

252
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:47,868
and a powerful magnetic field vibrates
these forks at a precise frequency.

253
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,829
Stimulating the pineal gland,
allowing us to see with it.

254
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,706
Listen to me.

255
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,586
Don't move when we're in
the field of the vibrations.

256
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:02,382
- Why?
- You move and they may see you. It...

257
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,426
will see you.

258
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,719
What is this "it" anyway?

259
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,430
Pray you don't see for yourself.

260
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:13,811
Now, I'm staying right by this switch.
If it appears, I'm shutting down.

261
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,231
Are you sure we're ready for this?

262
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,818
- Yes.
- Please...

263
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:25,405
Remember... Stay still.

264
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,440
This looks real great, people.

265
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,365
Oh, man.

266
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,001
What the hell is that?

267
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,088
- What?
- I don't know what.

268
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,340
No, don't move!

269
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,268
Holy shit!

270
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,730
Is this what you saw?

271
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,483
Yes. These things are
around us all the time.

272
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,951
It's coming.

273
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,911
- Bubba, are you all right?
- No!

274
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,871
Lost a little piece, but I'll be fine.

275
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,457
When you move in the field
it can sense you.

276
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,210
How far does the field extend?

277
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,003
I'm turning it off.

278
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,255
Crawford!

279
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,174
No.

280
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,968
Who is it?

281
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,719
Show yourself.

282
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,021
Welcome home, Crawford.

283
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,066
I'm glad you came back.

284
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,153
Who's the lovely woman?

285
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,198
It can't be you.

286
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,909
Dr Pretorious?

287
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:19,830
You have me at a disadvantage, my dear.

288
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:24,209
Crawford, where are your manners?
Bring your friend to me.

289
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,420
- I saw you die.
- No.

290
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:31,258
Not die. Just pass beyond.

291
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,509
It was horrible.

292
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:36,972
A necessary rite of passage.
Quite wonderful, in fact.

293
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,765
Where have you been hiding?

294
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:42,644
Move toward me, my dear.
I want to see you.

295
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,692
- How?
- Did I survive?

296
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,945
I am the master here.

297
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,323
Is it...

298
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,162
Is it really you, Edward?

299
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,122
Touch me.

300
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,041
If it pleases you.

301
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,669
If it helps you understand.

302
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:46,875
It's just a body, but my mind
is indivisible.

303
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,252
Bodies change.

304
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:21,201
That will be quite enough of that.

305
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,613
I feel exhilarated.

306
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,907
We almost died.

307
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:05,912
Incredible creature. It must have total
bodily control on a molecular level.

308
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,373
Yes, and Edward's mind.

309
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,626
He's become the thing that ate him.

310
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:15,797
Crawford, we saw the same things.
We've proved you're not insane.

311
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,008
I'm not so sure.

312
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,845
No. You faced your fear
and you overcame it.

313
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,265
You saved our lives.

314
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,561
Yeah. I owe you one.

315
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,482
Want some breakfast?

316
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,904
How can you eat after that?

317
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,698
Can't work without eating.

318
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,033
What work?

319
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,826
I've got to record the results.

320
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,412
The pineal gland was stimulated.

321
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,290
It gave me one hell of a headache.

322
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,375
Expansion of the pineal.

323
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,922
I'll have to do a study of the CAT scans
of schizophrenics.

324
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,758
If there's a statistical correlation

325
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,053
between schizophrenia and
an enlarged pineal, why...

326
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,805
they may be seeing or feeling
what we saw.

327
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:09,684
Their minds may be influenced
by those creatures.

328
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,896
Well, how about the hard-on I got?

329
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,941
Is there a statistical correlation
for that too?

330
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:22,405
Well... We know that the pineal gland
helps to regulate the sex drive.

331
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,909
Perhaps pineal stimulation causes a...

332
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:30,455
an accompanying sexual stimulation.

333
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,374
There's so much to learn.

334
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,043
Well, we learned what we came for.

335
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:39,464
He ain't crazy and that...
"it" ate Pretorious's head.

336
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:43,426
They're gonna think we're crazy
but that's their problem.

337
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,680
Well, we just have to try
the experiment again.

338
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,349
Did you say "we"?

339
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,936
Katherine, you can't.

340
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,146
You don't mean go back up there
now, do you?

341
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:58,149
You always run an experiment
twice to check the results.

342
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,068
Wait.

343
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,070
I saw it get to him, Katherine.

344
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,532
Just exactly what you're feeling
and it ruined him.

345
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,242
Pretorious.

346
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,620
Yes, I'd like to know more about him.

347
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,540
That resonator is a work of genius.

348
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,919
Were we in the same nightmare?

349
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,339
I mean didn't we just almost
all get eaten by an "it"?

350
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:25,260
All it takes is a hand on the switch.
If it appears you make it disappear.

351
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,430
I got a better idea. How about if
we disappear out the door?

352
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,807
Don't you understand?
This is the greatest discovery

353
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,269
since Van Leeuwenhoek first looked through
a microscope and saw an amoeba.

354
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,396
Yeah, but he wasn't down there
with the amoebas.

355
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,357
I have to find out if the pineal gland
is really the key.

356
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,280
OK fine. Fine, but not here. Not now.
Under controlled conditions.

357
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,616
But we have control. No one knows
that resonator better than you do.

358
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,077
You're right, and that's why
no one is touching it.

359
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
Crawford!

360
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:57,000
This could be the first step
in curing schizophrenia.

361
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,337
Crawford.

362
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:05,216
My father spent 15 years in
an institution - he died in one.

363
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,513
They called his condition incurable.

364
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:15,185
They tried everything.
Drugs, shock therapy, even surgery.

365
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,314
But they turned him into a vegetable.

366
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,651
I'm sorry.

367
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:29,282
We can save so many others.
Please, Crawford.

368
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,327
We can do it.

369
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,870
Help me.

370
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,246
Help you.

371
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:41,211
Help you to take your mind and shatter it?

372
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,050
I can't.

373
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,551
And I won't let you.

374
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:52,305
I'm the law here. You turn on that
machine, and it's reckless endangerment.

375
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,848
Look, we all need some rest.

376
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,768
Why don't we just get some sleep
and then we'll think about it.

377
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,854
Yeah, we'll get some rest
and then we're going.

378
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,724
Turn it off.

379
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,435
No.

380
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,064
I have to see more.

381
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,276
Feel more.

382
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,735
Turn it off.

383
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,613
No.

384
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,429
No. No.

385
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,974
We've got to stop it.

386
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,935
Don't stop.

387
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,192
I'm impressed, Crawford.

388
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,154
Do you realize now what I was creating?

389
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:39,115
Edward, my God, what have you become?

390
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,330
Myself.

391
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,834
Get the switch. I'll distract him.

392
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:55,214
Yes! I do find you distracting.

393
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,383
Don't! Crawford.

394
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,388
Listen to me.

395
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,809
Whatever you are, you're still Edward
Pretorious. You're still human.

396
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,729
More than human.

397
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,274
Join me, for ever.

398
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,946
Everyone must join me.

399
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,829
We'll be waiting for you, Crawford.

400
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,962
Where the hell are you going to now?

401
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,048
The circuit breaker.
I've got to turn it off.

402
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,216
Damn!

403
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,010
Smell.

404
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,430
Taste.

405
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:05,201
In another life I would have enjoyed you
in another way.

406
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,163
Messing with that damn machine again.

407
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,586
What the hell is that?

408
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,922
The vibrations must reach down here.

409
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,010
I'll be right back.

410
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,477
What are you gonna do to me?

411
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,565
I'm going to kiss you.

412
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,235
I'm sorry.

413
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:51,534
I really thought that I could control it.

414
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,875
It's changing us, doc.

415
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,711
All of us.

416
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,171
And not for the better.

417
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:10,261
I was wrong to turn on the resonator
with other subjects present.

418
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,683
It's clear now that only one person
should run the experiment.

419
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,727
This ain't an experiment.

420
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,353
It's suicide!

421
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,857
The presence of other subjects causes
dangerous distractions.

422
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,109
Now, I can stand right at
the master switch

423
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,529
and maintain control of that resonator
but I must do it myself.

424
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,199
I know this behaviour.
I've seen it in the streets.

425
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,996
You may be a scientist, lady, but
right now you're acting like a junkie.

426
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,248
Oh, just take him and leave.

427
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:44,003
Wrap him up. I'll get the van ready.

428
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,969
Put some clothes on,

429
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:55,348
unless you want me to take you
kicking and screaming like that.

430
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,951
What the hell are you doing?

431
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,213
I told you to get dressed.

432
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,224
I did.

433
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,354
The van's ready. You going like that?

434
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,700
What a shame.

435
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I just... love what you've done
with this room.

436
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,388
You're asking for it.

437
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,822
Look at yourself! Look at yourself!

438
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,949
Is that who you are?

439
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,329
I don't know.

440
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:57,084
I don't know who I am.

441
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,888
Listen.

442
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:14,018
- Crawford, we're leaving now.
- No, listen.

443
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,438
The resonator. It's him.

444
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,400
He's trying to start the resonator
from Beyond.

445
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,319
Son of a bitch!

446
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,500
Bastard!

447
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,845
Bubba, pull the cable!

448
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,525
Use the axe! The axe!

449
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,711
Damn!

450
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,903
No, God!

451
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,743
God!

452
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,374
God!

453
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,254
No!

454
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,471
Bubba!

455
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,587
Katherine.

456
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,890
Crawford!

457
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:00,100
Kiss.

458
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,395
Kiss, my dear.

459
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:17,367
Humans are such easy prey.

460
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,369
Let her go.

461
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,830
Oh, I will...

462
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,875
beyond her wildest dreams.

463
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:31,173
She will go into my mind
and I will go into hers.

464
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:34,885
It's the greatest sensual
pleasure there is.

465
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:38,764
You never knew pleasure or gave it.
Only pain.

466
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:47,898
You are evolving into a being

467
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:51,985
that has never existed before.

468
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:55,781
I'm Crawford Tillinghast.

469
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:58,367
Let it happen, Crawford.

470
00:58:58,409 --> 00:58:59,660
No!

471
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:03,330
- Let it out!
- No!

472
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,174
Crawford!

473
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:23,058
Oh, it's so beautiful.

474
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,228
So...

475
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,065
beautiful!

476
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,944
Now you can truly see.

477
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,988
What have you done to him?

478
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:42,160
I only awakened his sleeping pineal gland.

479
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:45,747
It did the rest itself.

480
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,803
No!

481
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,985
Crawford!

482
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,537
You whore!

483
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,585
Die, you fucker!

484
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,563
Oh, Crawford!

485
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,582
The police are here.

486
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,885
She's been telling us a pretty wild story.

487
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:07,139
I have been telling you the truth.

488
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,351
We'd like your opinion
of her mental state.

489
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:15,147
I'd rather give you my opinion
of her professional conduct.

490
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,983
You're contemptible.

491
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,405
Look at her.

492
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:26,575
I doubt she even understands
what she's done.

493
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,163
You cost Crawford Tillinghast his mind.

494
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:33,415
Quite possibly his life.

495
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,587
And another man's life.

496
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,093
That machine has got to be destroyed.

497
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:50,766
I listened to you the first time and
now I've lost one of my best men.

498
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:54,561
The DA's going to chew me a new asshole,
thanks to you.

499
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:58,023
She's in your custody now.

500
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:01,151
No, no, wait a minute.
You can't lock me up.

501
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,695
Not here, please.

502
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:08,241
I can't do much with her in this agitated
state. She'll upset the other patients.

503
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,453
Do whatever you think best.

504
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:15,749
Listen, Dr Bloch, please.

505
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:21,296
You know that I'm sorry for everything
that I've done.

506
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,800
You have got to let me go back.

507
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:28,178
Don't you tell me what I have got
to do, girl wonder.

508
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:32,682
You always have all the answers,
don't you.

509
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,686
Well, you're my patient now

510
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:39,397
and I've got a few answers myself.

511
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,025
Prepare her for electroshock therapy.

512
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,361
But... Dr Bloch...

513
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:47,614
- hospital policy says...
- Hospital policy dictates

514
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:52,035
that the nursing staff has to follow
orders. Now, do as I say.

515
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,704
- Yes, doctor.
- No!

516
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:02,420
Stop her!

517
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,092
My God, Bloch! No!

518
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:10,595
Set her up in number five.
I'm going to go check on Tillinghast.

519
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:13,348
If she continues to resist, sedate her.

520
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:38,516
Please, don't do this.

521
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,352
It's not necessary.

522
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,187
I'm all right now.

523
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,001
He's gone.

524
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,045
Call security.

525
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,749
Crawford.

526
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,002
Please don't eat those.

527
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,424
Delicious.

528
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:55,760
They... can make you very sick.

529
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,193
Oh God!

530
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:20,118
What is happening to me?

531
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:25,123
We...

532
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:29,669
We don't know for sure
but we're going to find out.

533
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:57,655
We're going to go in
the hall now, Crawford.

534
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,112
Take it easy, honey.

535
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,120
Come quick. Something's happened
and we need your help.

536
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:47,747
Wait a minute. What about her?

537
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,833
Lock her up in her room.

538
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:30,999
Katherine?

539
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:36,421
Katherine?

540
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:12,165
I need a drink.

541
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:17,754
Oh God! Let me outta here.

542
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:23,593
- You'd better hurry...
- Yeah, yeah.

543
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:25,678
Before he goes into DTs.

544
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:34,103
Oh, and get me a candy bar. I'm starving.

545
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,524
Harley.

546
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:43,321
Harley, what's going on?

547
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,201
Oh no! Oh, dear Lord!

548
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,245
Oh God! Oh no!

549
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:54,290
I saw... a snake.

550
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:59,003
A snake came out of its head
and ate him. Dear Lord!

551
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:02,632
Shit, Harley, you son of a bitch,
he's gone into DTs.

552
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:03,841
A long... A long...

553
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:06,010
Harley!

554
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:09,681
Oh, dear Lord! No, God!

555
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,517
Harley?

556
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:15,353
You all right?

557
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:26,072
That's the snake man! That's him!

558
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:35,790
Somebody! Somebody help me!

559
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:46,592
Help! Help!

560
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,904
Oh help! Somebody!

561
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:08,406
Help!

562
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:05,106
Crawford! Stop!

563
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:07,275
Crawford, let me go.

564
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:09,110
What are? Crawford?

565
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:12,572
Crawford, stop!

566
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:20,538
Crawford, oh my God!
Why are you doing this?

567
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:23,082
Because I love you, Katherine.

568
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:26,461
Crawford, we have to get out of here.
The resonator's going to blow up.

569
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:28,087
I want us to be together.

570
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,422
Listen to me.

571
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,592
I set a timing device on a bomb.
We only have a few minutes.

572
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,135
It doesn't matter.

573
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:39,307
If Pretorious can turn on that machine
then he'll always have a way back here.

574
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:40,600
He's always here.

575
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,570
Don't you understand?
He won't just influence us.

576
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,865
He'll devour us and the rest
of the human race if he can.

577
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,575
You're so beautiful.

578
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:59,911
Please, Crawford.

579
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:03,831
It won't hurt, I promise.

580
01:15:33,737 --> 01:15:35,029
Crawford!

581
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:37,031
Help me!

582
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,079
Katherine?

583
01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:50,378
Welcome, my dear.
I've been waiting for you.

584
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:53,172
- Edward! No!
- Yes!

585
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:59,011
The greatest sensual pleasure there is
is to know the desires of another mind.

586
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:02,056
I know your desires, you impotent pig!

587
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:07,228
We are the most powerful being
in the universe.

588
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:11,983
She'll know, Edward, how pathetic you are.

589
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:14,986
How you can't make love.

590
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:18,656
Maybe you could teach me.

591
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,121
Crawford!

592
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:39,885
All right, come and get me, eunuch.

593
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,722
This time I'm not running away.

594
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:24,216
Katherine, run!

595
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:31,419
Crawford!

596
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,016
What happened?

597
01:20:56,059 --> 01:20:58,602
There was a big explosion
near the top of the house.

598
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:16,120
I've called the fire department.
They'll get you to the hospital.

599
01:21:16,162 --> 01:21:18,414
Oh, my God!

600
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:21,250
What happened up there?

601
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:27,339
It...

602
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:30,926
ate him.
