1
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,112
<i>West of Arkham...</i>

2
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,280
<i>...the hills rise wild...</i>

3
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,791
<i>...and there are valleys
with deep woods</i>

4
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,116
<i>that no ax has ever cut.</i>

5
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,351
<i>There are dark, narrow glens</i>

6
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,279
<i>where the trees
slope fantastically...</i>

7
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,317
<i>...where thin brooklets trickle</i>

8
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,751
<i>without ever having caught
the glimpse of sunlight.</i>

9
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,432
<i>When I went into the hills
and vales</i>

10
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,638
<i>to survey
for the new reservoir,</i>

11
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,911
<i>they told me
the place was evil.</i>

12
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,592
<i>They told me this in Arkham,</i>

13
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,156
<i>and because
that is a very old town,</i>

14
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,079
<i>full of witch legends,</i>

15
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,430
<i>I thought the evil
must be something</i>

16
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,513
<i>which grandams
had whispered to children</i>

17
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,916
<i>through centuries.</i>

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,993
<i>Then I saw the dark
westward tangle of glens</i>

19
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,874
<i>and slopes for myself...</i>

20
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,354
<i>...and ceased
to wonder at anything</i>

21
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,952
<i>besides its own elder mystery.</i>

22
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,558
Before me, Raphael.

23
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,196
Behind me, Gabriel.

24
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,079
To my left...

25
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,759
...Uriel.

26
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,675
And to my right, Michael.

27
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,555
I call upon
the principalities of earth,

28
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,640
air, fire, water, and ether.

29
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,718
Be present with me now.

30
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,639
Spirit of fire,

31
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,913
continue to burn out

32
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,078
any trace of cancer

33
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,037
from the body
of Theresa Gardner, my mother.

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,392
Grant me your protection.

35
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,878
Grant me my freedom.

36
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,756
And last, not least,

37
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,393
get me out of here.

38
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,520
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to intrude.

39
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,376
- I didn't see you.
- This is private property.

40
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,536
Oh, I was told
this is county land.

41
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,280
County land ends at the river.
You're trespassing.

42
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,870
Ah. They said the mayor notified
all the property owners.

43
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,436
- Uh, I apologize.
- First I've heard of it.

44
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,556
What now?

45
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,672
Sorry.
I'm, uh... I'm Ward Phillips.

46
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,440
I'm doing a survey of the valley
for Hydrolit.

47
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,953
The hydroelectric company.

48
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Cool story.

49
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:16,155
Well, thanks for
ruining my ritual, Ward.

50
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,673
- Ritual?
- Yes, ritual.

51
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,918
You know, will, intent,
blessed be?

52
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,555
Is it Wiccan or Alexandrian?

53
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Which do you think?

54
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,354
Definitely Alexandrian.

55
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,994
That's your
second mistake today.

56
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,795
Stick to the east bank
and you'll find your way back.

57
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,991
Yeah, I will.
Thanks.

58
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,680
Hey, uh,
I didn't get your name.

59
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,676
Lavinia Gardner.

60
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,033
I live out here.
Unfortunately.

61
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,039
- Let's go.
- Nice knowing you.

62
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,639
Come on, Comet.

63
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,514
Where were you?

64
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,631
Are you trying to give
your mother a heart attack?

65
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,776
I just thought I'd take Comet
around the trail before dinner.

66
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,359
It's not a big deal.

67
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,176
And I thought I told you
not to go without your helmet.

68
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,856
And where are your boots?
What happened to your boots?

69
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,236
Dad, Jesus, relax.
It's not like I'm trick riding.

70
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,715
Accidents happen, Lavinny.
Someday...

71
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,150
I'll have kids of my own,
and I'll understand.

72
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,176
Exactly right. See?
Communication. Me and you, babe.

73
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,920
Now get Comet back into the barn
before your mother finds out.

74
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,553
Lavinia.

75
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,592
Have you seen your brother?
He's been gone all afternoon.

76
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,836
He's supposed to be studying,
as are you.

77
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,553
How should I know?

78
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,336
He's probably listening
to NASA recordings with Ezra.

79
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,230
Do you mean to tell me that
your brother is smoking dope

80
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,512
with that hippie reprobate,
and you didn't do anything?

81
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,153
Lavinia?
You didn't do anything?

82
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,520
- Let it go, sweetie.
- No.

83
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,358
It's fine. She's fine.
Everything is fine.

84
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,836
Benny, I can smell
your stoned ass from here.

85
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,629
- Busted.
- You're so obvious.

86
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,160
Sam!

87
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,032
Benny's little
partner in crime.

88
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,736
Hey, I found some more
of Grandpa's old stuff.

89
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,399
- Oh, no way!
- Check this out.

90
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,556
Let me see.

91
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,398
Ooh! Heh.
Dibs.

92
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,856
- No fair!
- You already got his compass.

93
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,280
I need that compass.

94
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,553
Oh.
Did you manage to curse us all?

95
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,200
I don't do curses.

96
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,720
They come back on you
times three.

97
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,576
Now go put Comet's tack away
so we're on time for dinner,

98
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,069
and Mom doesn't bust
any more blood vessels.

99
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,316
- I'm not your barn bitch.
- Actually, you are.

100
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,072
Witch. Sorceress.
Soul-sucking succubus.

101
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,874
Hey, I met some weird guy
down by the river.

102
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,559
Said he was doing a survey.

103
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,398
A survey of what?

104
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,397
The water table
or something.

105
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,035
Not sure.

106
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,594
He's kind of cute, though.

107
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,869
Aw.

108
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,152
What are you looking at,
Jack-Jack?

109
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,919
Dad said
if you look long enough,

110
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,838
you can see stars
down there.

111
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,031
Hmm!
I wouldn't hold my breath.

112
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,152
Dad took too much acid
back in the hippie days.

113
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,272
But I do see stars!

114
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,959
Your eyes are playing tricks.

115
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,720
W-What are you
doing out here, anyway?

116
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,150
Dad sent me for water,
but I can't untie the rope.

117
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,634
Jesus.

118
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,390
Why can't they just buy bottled
water like everyone else?

119
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,514
Thanks for cooking again,
Dad.

120
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,870
Aw, you know I love cooking
for you guys.

121
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,274
Oh, by the smell

122
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,676
I can tell
it's really coming a long way.

123
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,752
- I miss Mom's pancakes.
- Okay.

124
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,077
So, uh, what is for dinner?

125
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,270
Cassoulet.

126
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,516
Oh, no.
Gross.

127
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,711
It's a traditional French dish.

128
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,240
In other words, peasant food.

129
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,136
Jack, can you take the
lid off the veggies, please?

130
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,197
- Yeah.
- I think it smells great.

131
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,536
That's because you're high.

132
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,136
Shut up. We all know
you'd rather be eating

133
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,216
fast food right now,
anyway.

134
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,674
I love mystery meat.

135
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,077
Well, this is not
mystery meat, dear.

136
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,875
It's a mélange of duck,
pork, regional spices,

137
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,912
and it just happens to be
your mother's favorite.

138
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,952
Yeah!
I love ducks!

139
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,878
Everybody loves ducks.

140
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,435
We are down four pips,
but we didn't get oversold.

141
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,831
The market came up.

142
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,270
No, we don't want to
be selling just yet.

143
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,152
Uh, when I took
the short position,

144
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,669
I was assuming that we'd get
two-to-one on it.

145
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,393
Theresa!
Dinner's ready!

146
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,558
Look, we have
a nice ratio confluence.

147
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,592
It's getting cold!

148
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,996
Just take a look
at the ratio strategy I sent,

149
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,430
and I'll call you
in an hour?

150
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,954
Great.

151
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:02,275
I'm coming.

152
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,437
You're not gonna
have it? Really?

153
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,240
Babe, can you do something
about that router?

154
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,749
I'm gonna start
losing clients.

155
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,872
It's probably the dish.
I'll take a look at it tomorrow.

156
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,320
Oh, thank you.

157
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,430
Hmm.

158
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,637
Sam, lie down.

159
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,875
Good boy.

160
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,877
- What's this?
- Cassoulet.

161
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,755
Although apparently our daughter
would rather have fast food.

162
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,519
Uh, and just
what kind of meat

163
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,416
do you think you're eating
at the Golden Arches?

164
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,033
I know
it's mechanically retrieved,

165
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,799
but it tastes like heaven.

166
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,079
Then you'll know
what heaven is.

167
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,160
No, I'm gonna puke.
No one eats alpacas.

168
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,669
They use them
to make sweaters.

169
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,360
I don't know why you bought them
in the first place.

170
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,678
Because they're the animal
of the future, remember?

171
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,837
Those Mayans knew
what they were about.

172
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,136
- That's why they went extinct.
- Lavinia, stop it.

173
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,310
Come on, eat up.

174
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,113
Nathan, do you think
that you could

175
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,518
go down to the basement and
choose us one of your finest?

176
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
I know just the thing.

177
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,072
Next time I'll cook.

178
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,759
- It's not that bad.
- Yeah.

179
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,430
There's a smell of
a conspiracy here.

180
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,636
What's the matter?
Hmm?

181
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,160
Nothing.
It's just...

182
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,556
I just don't think
I can handle this.

183
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,990
- Like, it's been...
- She's being moody.

184
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,520
...a year of really...

185
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,835
Guess what time it is?

186
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,936
- I mean...
- No. Don't say it. Please.

187
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,429
Guess what time it is.

188
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,911
- Dad.
- Time for you to do the dishes!

189
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,997
- You! You! You!
- No! Jack! Jack!

190
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,236
- No, it's you, Jack.
- No!

191
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,536
It's you, Jack.
You got to do it.

192
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,994
Now it's Lavinia!

193
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,316
No, it's not my turn.
That's not how this works.

194
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,591
We have a system in this house.
It's Jack's turn.

195
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,634
- Hey.
- Hi.

196
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,275
God, you know,
I hear myself with her.

197
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,516
I am turning into my mother.

198
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,994
Oh, God.

199
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,111
You couldn't be any more
different than your mother.

200
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,310
Believe me.

201
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,159
That's what everyone says
until they are.

202
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,237
What about me?

203
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,351
Living on
my father's old farm,

204
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,234
exactly like I said
I never would.

205
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,033
But it's the first thing
you've ever done

206
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,434
he would have approved of.

207
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,639
Yeah, I can still hear his
intellectually abusive voice

208
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,399
in my head.

209
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,238
"You're never gonna be
a painter, Nathan.

210
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,556
So you can just get the fuck
out of my sight, Nathan."

211
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,831
Stop it.
It'll fade.

212
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,873
- Just look at this place, hmm?
- Yeah.

213
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,879
I mean, he wouldn't even
recognize it.

214
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,400
It's ours.

215
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,675
Nathan, I...

216
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,632
Just...

217
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,832
It's been six months.
Don't you think we should try?

218
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,519
I...

219
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,279
I just...

220
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,075
I don't know how you can
still be interested in me.

221
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,712
You know I've always been
a leg man.

222
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,279
So if I have my legs cut off,
would you still love me then?

223
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,719
Bit kinky, but...

224
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,956
Yes!

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,276
Could tuck you into
my carry-on luggage

226
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,277
and enjoy you
wherever I go.

227
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,879
Ooh!
Now, that <i>is</i> sexy.

228
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,320
Mmm.

229
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,640
And look at this.

230
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,275
Look at us.

231
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,279
All those years in the big city,
and we finally got out.

232
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,960
Yeah.

233
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,593
We're living the dream.

234
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,512
Maybe it is a dream.

235
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:25,079
Well, a dream you dream alone
is just a dream.

236
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,114
A dream you dream together
is reality.

237
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,711
You are even more beautiful
to me now than ever.

238
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,197
It's because you took
your glasses off.

239
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,720
It's true.

240
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,797
I feel, um...

241
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,436
...tarnished.

242
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,556
Honey...

243
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,199
...you will always be
my golden lady.

244
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,874
- Really?
- Yeah.

245
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,240
I love you.

246
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,197
Oh, hey, Sam.
Good boy.

247
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,197
Good boy, Sam.

248
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,960
Oh, you're not interested
in the black hole, Sam?

249
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,559
Hmm?

250
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,433
Mommy?

251
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,439
Oh, baby.

252
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,554
Oh, my God.
I've missed you.

253
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
Sam?

254
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,000
Mommy?

255
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,193
What?!

256
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,696
What the hell is that?!

257
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,519
- Jack?
- Jack?

258
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,153
Jack?

259
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,795
Jack.
Look at Daddy.

260
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,672
Jack.
Jack.

261
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,360
Come here. Come here.
Come on up. Come on.

262
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,520
- Look at Daddy.
- Mom?

263
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,976
Look at Daddy.
What are you looking there?

264
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,216
- Dad?
- I know.

265
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,856
What the fuck was that?
An earthquake?

266
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,856
Just watch your language.
Can you watch your language?

267
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,336
God, what is that smell?

268
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,512
Holy fucking shit!

269
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,056
Benny, bring your phone.
Come on! Come on!

270
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,560
Smoking like crazy.

271
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,216
No, don't go near it.
Don't go near it.

272
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,311
Sam, get back inside.
Get back inside.

273
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,716
- I said go inside.
- What the hell is that?

274
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,830
Just go inside!

275
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,200
Jesus.
What a mess.

276
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,833
It smells.

277
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,678
Nate!

278
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,040
There's something wrong
with Jack!

279
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,431
Ohh.
It's okay, baby.

280
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,795
You just had a bad dream.

281
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,513
No, I think...
I think he's in shock.

282
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,994
We should take him
to the hospital.

283
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,396
No, it's over an hour away.
Jack, can you talk to Daddy?

284
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,113
Why does it matter
how far away it is?

285
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,391
- Look at him!
- What the hell happened?

286
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,794
Did you guys hear it?

287
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,256
It sounded like a propeller
plane having an aneurysm.

288
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,749
No, it wasn't a plane.

289
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,636
That smell.

290
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,717
I don't know, like, funny.

291
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,513
You can still...

292
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,199
Still smell it now.

293
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,799
I thought it was
a nuclear strike.

294
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,274
The Russians and Chinese,
dude.

295
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,976
- End-of-the-world shit.
- You wish.

296
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,976
We'd be vaporized,
become part of the reaction,

297
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,320
and convert into pure energy.

298
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,636
Maybe the meteorite
sent an alien plague

299
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,592
infecting the entire
fucking planet.

300
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,552
Seriously apocalyptic.

301
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,755
- Mommy?
- Yes, baby, I'm right here!

302
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,917
- My head hurts.
- Okay, honey.

303
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,350
Look, um,
let's get you upstairs.

304
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,596
I'll put you to bed,
and you'll be okay.

305
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,552
- I don't want to!
- Mm!

306
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,717
No, it's okay, baby.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

307
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,798
Oh, your son is sick, and this
is what you're gonna do, huh?

308
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,072
Well, under the circumstances,
I don't see what else I...

309
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,952
Come on.
Let's get you up.

310
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,593
You can sleep with me tonight.

311
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,031
In the morning
everything is gonna be okay.

312
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,231
Mayor Tooma.

313
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,590
Sheriff Pierce.
Thank you for coming.

314
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,996
This better be
worth my time.

315
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,316
I am so sorry
about the smell.

316
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,591
Can you smell it?

317
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,199
I don't smell anything.

318
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,357
Like somebody
lit a dog on fire.

319
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,438
Well, anyway,
that <i>was</i> my front yard.

320
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,039
Careful.
It's still hot.

321
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,355
All right.
Thanks.

322
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:15,761
Something metallic
down here.

323
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,950
What the hell happened here?

324
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,512
Well, it was last night.

325
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,153
I was in bed with my wife.

326
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,989
It was the first time that we,
you know, since the operation,

327
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,440
and then there was this boom,

328
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,079
like... like a...
like a sonic boom,

329
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,591
and a big flash,
like a pink light.

330
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,376
Or, actually, I don't even know
what color it was.

331
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,710
It wasn't like any color
I'd ever seen before,

332
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,117
and then everything just blew up
or fell from the sky.

333
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,593
What are you doing here?

334
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,314
Think this is the result
of your little ritual yesterday?

335
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,511
Ha!
If only.

336
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,710
Are you looking at my legs?

337
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,719
What? Oh. No. Um...
No, I was...

338
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,036
Yeah, sure you weren't.
Come on.

339
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,000
Who's this?

340
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,794
Oh, this is that
weird guy I met by the river.

341
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,240
Sorry,
what was your name again?

342
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,555
Ward Phillips.

343
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,159
Let me guess.
Boston.

344
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,271
Providence, actually.

345
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,816
He's doing a survey
of the groundwater.

346
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,616
Um, isn't... isn't that what
you said yesterday?

347
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,632
Yeah, yeah.
I'm a... I'm a hydrologist.

348
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,036
Ward, do you have any idea
what's going on here?

349
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,037
Oh, excuse me.

350
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,393
- Hey, Ward.
- Hey.

351
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,079
- Hey.
- Hey, I'm Benny.

352
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,994
D-Don't get too close.

353
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,112
Uh, looks like a meteorite.

354
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,436
Usually they disintegrate
before they hit the ground,

355
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,874
but not always.

356
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,435
A meteorite?
Whoa.

357
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,831
Sheriff, we need to get
some photographs.

358
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,270
Nathan, would you mind
if I bring some press next time?

359
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,549
This can be great for tourism.

360
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,080
I'd just as soon
not publicize it.

361
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,793
Mayor, wait.

362
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,896
Is there a doctor around here
who's open on weekends?

363
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,274
My son isn't feeling well...

364
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,277
You can try the hospital
in Arkham.

365
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,437
They usually have somebody
on the emergency desk.

366
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,354
- Isn't there anywhere closer?
- Welcome to life in the sticks.

367
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,240
You know, you should have
sold this place to me

368
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,795
Bye-bye.

369
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,040
Isn't it insane?

370
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,033
Check it out.

371
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,560
Hurry!

372
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,553
Lavinia, can you go back inside
and check on your mother?

373
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,560
Dad!

374
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:32,631
It's okay.
We got this covered.

375
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
Off you go.

376
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,556
- See you later.
- Yeah.

377
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,513
Why don't you
go check on her?

378
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
- Be careful.
- Okay.

379
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,193
It's cooling off
really fast now.

380
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,560
Is that normal?

381
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,231
Smoke coming out of it,
crazy color.

382
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,192
- It was so cool.
- Okay.

383
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,536
You ever seen anything
like this before?

384
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Um...

385
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,431
Hey.
Who's that guy?

386
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,159
Who?

387
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,431
Um, Ward something.

388
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,637
- He's a hydrologist.
- Oh.

389
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,718
- You like him, huh?
- What? No.

390
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,989
Why would you say that?

391
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,997
Oh, well, come on.
It was obvious.

392
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,760
You were practically
throwing yourself at him.

393
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,393
- I mean, honey...
- Mom.

394
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,816
Think... Look at the way
you're dressed.

395
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,150
Think of the signals
you're giving out.

396
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,350
Oh, God.

397
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,199
Do you think it's radioactive
like kryptonite?

398
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,391
Christ, I hope not.

399
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,113
Well, what about, like,
an alien virus?

400
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,560
I mean, it's from space,
right?

401
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,876
than ordinary rocks.

402
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,276
Well, do you think
it could be valuable?

403
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,630
Now, that's something
I hadn't considered.

404
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,912
Well, if you don't mind,
it's time we milked the alpacas.

405
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,160
Milk the what?

406
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,394
It's not like
milking a goat.

407
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,750
You don't get a lot of milk
from an alpaca.

408
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,874
It takes great patience
and technique.

409
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,631
And, of course, you have to be
very gentle with the, uh, boobs.

410
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,558
But once you get them
warmed up...

411
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,195
Oh.
Nice one, dad.

412
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,792
Yeah, I find mixing
a little fennel into their feed

413
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,392
increases the yield
and improves the flavor.

414
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,016
- Would you like a taste?
- Oh, no.

415
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,396
Um, lactose intolerant.

416
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,315
Your loss.

417
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,076
Sweetie?

418
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,753
Can you open the door, please?

419
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,360
I'm so sorry.

420
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,360
I-I don't... I don't know
what came over me.

421
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,399
Lavinia, come on.
Please open the door.

422
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,229
Uh, is there anyone else
living on the property,

423
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,999
aside from your family?

424
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,553
There's Ezra, our squatter,
but he keeps to himself.

425
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,080
I haven't seen him in months.

426
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,520
Would it be okay
if I talk with him?

427
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,791
You can try. I mean,
Benny can show you the way.

428
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,069
Yeah.
Yeah, for sure.

429
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,800
But I can't promise
he's gonna talk to you.

430
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,313
He's, um, special.

431
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,431
Looks like
there's a storm coming in.

432
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,715
Yeah.

433
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,439
Are those cameras?

434
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,194
Yeah. Ezra used to be
an electrician back in the day.

435
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,416
He's got this whole place
wired up.

436
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,318
Oh.

437
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,192
Where's his juice come from?

438
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,960
Solar.
Totally off the grid.

439
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,957
Hey!
Ezra!

440
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,639
You got a visitor!

441
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,351
Oh!
It's the surveyor man!

442
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,792
I'm sorry.
I don't think we've met yet.

443
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,433
- I'm, uh...
- The hydrologist.

444
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,876
Yeah.

445
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,559
Pretty well informed.

446
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,514
Lot of little birdies flitting
around here in this ecosphere.

447
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,677
You just got to know
how to decode them.

448
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,154
Come on in.

449
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,078
We'll talk about
the space metal.

450
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,672
- Want a hit?
- Oh, no, thank you.

451
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,791
I didn't think so.

452
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,354
Hey, some java?

453
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,516
- Yeah.
- All right.

454
00:28:33,321 --> 00:28:36,439
Aw.
What's her name?

455
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,830
G-spot.
- What?

456
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,600
What? Come on. That's
like the coolest name ever.

457
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,997
A pussy named G-spot?
It's totally hilarious.

458
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,192
Hey.
Come here, lady.

459
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
Hi.

460
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:50,641
All right.

461
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,718
Oh, yeah, you like this?
You like that?

462
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,116
Hey, my apologies
for the Adam's ale.

463
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,278
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

464
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,279
Yeah, the H2O has gone
a little brackish.

465
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,998
Yeah, I can't...
I can't smell anything.

466
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,918
It's probably just rust
from the taps.

467
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,555
Have you tried running the
faucet, see if it runs clear?

468
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,877
Hey, that, my friend, is
straight from the mother's tit.

469
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,879
Yeah, we've had some
problems with the well before

470
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,115
but only in the summer.

471
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,435
Something about the aquifer.

472
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,671
Right.
Yeah.

473
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,235
That's to do with the level
of the water table, but...

474
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,440
I don't know. Shouldn't be
happening this time of year.

475
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,794
Freshest water
in the department.

476
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,799
That's what Dad always says.

477
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,115
I'm sure it's fine,

478
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,231
but if you want
I could run a test on a sample.

479
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,112
I have all my equipment
back up in the tent.

480
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,720
So, you know,
better safe than sorry.

481
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,831
Hey, knock yourself out.

482
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,232
All right!

483
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,919
Damn, that was close.

484
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,429
Tell it, baby.
Tell it, tell it!

485
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,752
It's so beautiful.

486
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,797
Lavinny, what are you doing?

487
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,197
Come on.
Let's go back inside.

488
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,554
It's drawing the lightning.

489
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,995
<i>In my next term
as your mayor,</i>

490
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,636
<i>we will be undertaking the
largest infrastructure project</i>

491
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,149
<i>in our city's history
with the construction</i>

492
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,669
<i>of the freshwater reservoir
on the Miskatonic...</i>

493
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,633
<i>The economic impact alone...</i>

494
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,311
Hello?

495
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,834
Hello?

496
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,800
Who is that?

497
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,874
What the hell?

498
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

499
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,000
How can something that big
just disappear?

500
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,714
I don't know, but I'm glad.

501
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,077
Did you plant those?

502
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,553
No.
Maybe they're perennials.

503
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,030
Great.
Here comes the circus.

504
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,436
Baby.

505
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,936
<i>Could you please tell us
exactly what happened?</i>

506
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,136
<i>Well, there was a boom.</i>

507
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,674
<i>Uh, it was a couple nights ago.</i>

508
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,677
<i>A boom and a flash of light
and a vibration,</i>

509
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,760
<i>and we came out,
and we saw this large rock.</i>

510
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,679
Horrible. Hideous.
Oh, my God.

511
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,871
Couldn't somebody have given me
a comb? Jesus!

512
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,656
<i>I'm here with Arkham resident
Nathan Gardner,</i>

513
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,512
<i>who claims that
an unidentified flying object</i>

514
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,816
<i>landed in his front yard
last night.</i>

515
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,160
"UFO witness"?

516
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,396
You said UFO!
I didn't say UFO!

517
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,510
Oh, for fuck's sake.

518
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,120
Theresa, can you
get out here, please?

519
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,838
Did you see a UFO?
I didn't see any UFO.

520
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,195
<i>Right, and, uh...</i>

521
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,754
<i>We had
a top hydrologist here...</i>

522
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,234
<i>not a geologist...</i>

523
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,078
Yeah, I think
the freaked-out-abductee look

524
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,920
suits you pretty well.

525
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:34,921
<i>Very good.</i>

526
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,235
<i>So the meteorite,</i>

527
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,999
<i>which happened to
mysteriously disappear</i>

528
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,679
<i>before the time
my team and I got here.</i>

529
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,916
<i>How does an object
of that size...</i>

530
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,997
Theresa, can you please
get out here?

531
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,520
<i>Mr. Gardner, were you sober</i>

532
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,758
<i>at the time
that this event happened?</i>

533
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,951
<i>Uh, well, I mean,
I like a bit of bourbon.</i>

534
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,071
<i>Um, uh,
it comes out of Texas.</i>

535
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,316
Oh, for fuck's sake.

536
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,238
<i>I was... I was not...
The night before,</i>

537
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,033
<i>I had a few drinks,
but I wasn't...</i>

538
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,400
<i>I was sober when I came out.</i>

539
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,656
- Oh, man.
- Jack, go get your mother.

540
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,911
Okay.

541
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,954
What part of "meteorite"
do you not understand?

542
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,519
Mom.

543
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,216
<i>I wouldn't classify that
as mental illness.</i>

544
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,913
<i>WARK News.</i>

545
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,429
Daddy!
Mommy's hurt!

546
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,556
Baby?

547
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,360
Dinner's ready.

548
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,216
<i>...calling the family's
claim into question.</i>

549
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,118
God, why did I do that?

550
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,152
It's all right.

551
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,031
- Keep your hand elevated.
- Okay.

552
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,639
- Just keep it up.
- Yeah.

553
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,592
We'll call you
from the hospital.

554
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,677
Benny,
you're man of the house.

555
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,360
And I want those alpacas
back in the barn by 10:00.

556
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,834
- You got it, Dad.
- 10:00!

557
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,871
What are we gonna do?

558
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,231
I don't know.
You're the man of the house.

559
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,035
Come on, Jack-Jack.
Time for bed.

560
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,869
Benny will look after us
because he's so responsible.

561
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,990
Race you upstairs.

562
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,031
Come on.
Come on.

563
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,073
Come on.

564
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,270
Benny?

565
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,518
Benny, get your stupid ass
out here now!

566
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,270
Fuck.
What?

567
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,696
You were supposed
to feed the alpacas.

568
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,439
I already did.

569
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,760
What are you talking about?
They're standing right there.

570
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,999
I already fed them.

571
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,191
- Well...
- What the...?

572
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,436
Get them into the barn, okay?

573
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,558
And lay off the weed,
all right?

574
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,432
I can't fucking do this
on my own, okay?

575
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
- Go.
- Okay.

576
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:13,955
Go!
Just do it already!

577
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,231
Harpy. Harridan.
Hairy ax wound.

578
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,078
Maggot dick.

579
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,159
Jeez.

580
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,316
Hey, girl.

581
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,192
Come on, girl.

582
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,954
Jack?

583
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,640
What are you doing?

584
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:51,233
Shh!

585
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,840
It's talking
to me.

586
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,997
Who?
Who's talking to you?

587
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,635
The man in the well.

588
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,198
Okay.

589
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,639
Dad?
Hello?

590
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,430
Dad?

591
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Hello?

592
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,197
Hello?
Lavinia?

593
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,913
Is that you?

594
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,656
<i>A weather report
for Arkham County,</i>

595
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,400
<i>Innsmouth, Aylesbury,
Dunwich, Kingsport...</i>

596
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,636
<i>Low temperature
around 54 degrees.</i>

597
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,797
<i>High near...</i>

598
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,080
Don't puke.
Don't puke.

599
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,316
Dad?

600
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,160
Lavinia, hey.

601
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,557
Um, this really isn't
a good time.

602
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,512
Are you guys okay?

603
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,711
Um, no,
I'm not feeling too well.

604
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,035
All right, well,

605
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,072
that's actually what I want to
talk to you about.

606
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,896
I think there's something wrong
with the water here,

607
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,760
some kind of contamination.

608
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:05,559
Sorry, what?

609
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,712
A contamination
with the... the water.

610
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,816
Um, I don't know exactly what.

611
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,096
But, um, we're sending a sample
back to the lab in Arkham.

612
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,176
In the meantime...

613
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,759
I believe it, science guy.

614
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,520
Hey, try not to drink
the water, okay?

615
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,239
Hey, kiddo.
What are you up to?

616
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,590
Playing with my friends.

617
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,399
Okeydokey.
Well, um, have fun, okay?

618
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,359
Ezra?

619
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,680
Ezra?

620
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,750
Ezra?

621
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,397
Hey, make yourself
comfortable, amigo.

622
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,272
What the hell
are you doing down there?

623
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,516
I'm reorganizing.

624
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,598
- Oh, want some java?
- Uh, no, thank you.

625
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,757
That's actually what I wanted
to talk to you about.

626
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,871
I don't think
you should be drinking that.

627
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,515
I found something in the water.
Just a trace, really.

628
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,517
Um... Hey, where's G-spot?

629
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,313
Heh!
Who knows?

630
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,670
Caterwauling out there
somewhere.

631
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,280
Really haven't seen her
since it all started.

632
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,595
Since what all started?

633
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,791
Shh!

634
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,160
You can hear them down there.

635
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,877
H-Hear them?
Hear who?

636
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,273
Yeah, I could hear them
while I slept,

637
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,994
shuffling around, chattering.

638
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,033
See, I knew no one would believe
me unless I got it on Memorex.

639
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,440
What exactly am I supposed to be
listening to?

640
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,714
The people under the floor,
dude.

641
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,955
The aliens.

642
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,750
They're there.

643
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,032
Well, yeah, it is strange.

644
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,720
But it's probably
geothermal activity

645
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,399
- or magnetic distortions.
- No, no.

646
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,635
Something like that.

647
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,080
They came on the rock.

648
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,911
Look, no offense, Ezra,
but that's pretty out there.

649
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,997
You don't get it, do you?

650
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,431
It's not out there.
It's in here.

651
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,669
It's in the static.
It's in the moisture.

652
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,916
Up is down.
Fast is slow.

653
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,873
What's in here is out there,

654
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,116
and what's out there
is in here now.

655
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,719
Comprendo?

656
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,558
Um, look,

657
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,816
why don't you think about
getting out of here for a while?

658
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,160
I'm gonna be back tomorrow.

659
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,680
I'll have some more equipment
with me.

660
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,189
I'm sure it will all make
more sense in the morning.

661
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,152
Morning?

662
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,873
Dude, it's already morning.

663
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,350
All right. Um, stick to
bottled water, okay?

664
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,120
Oh, hey, I will let you know
if I see G-spot.

665
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,114
You might see her, but I don't
think you'll recognize her.

666
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,395
Nathan.

667
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,919
Doing okay?
We're almost there.

668
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,236
Yeah.
I just feel so stupid.

669
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,749
I mean, I just don't even know
what I was thinking.

670
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,276
And I don't even want to
think about

671
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:56,111
how many clients I pissed off
by not getting back to them.

672
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,595
- Mm.
- The surgery was successful.

673
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
That's the important thing.
Look out!
Aah!

674
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,496
- Christ, that was close.
- What... What...

675
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,557
Did you see that thing?
What was that thing?

676
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,399
- Did you see its eyes?
- Oh, my God.

677
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,671
What are you doing?

678
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,758
I-I want to call the kids,
just check that they're okay.

679
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,120
Honey, the kids are fine.

680
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,596
What are you doing
in my room?

681
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,235
- Where have you been?
- I was out in the back field.

682
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,911
I thought I heard Sam.
I was worried about him.

683
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,599
Look, I know it sounds weird,

684
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,439
but I kind of got lost
out there.

685
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,160
You know, like,
one second it was daytime,

686
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,635
then all of a sudden
it was so dark

687
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,034
I couldn't even
find the house.

688
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,113
What the hell is going on?

689
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,595
It's probably Dad.

690
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,438
At least I hope it's Dad.

691
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,800
Dad?

692
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,676
Who was that?

693
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,750
I'm not sure.

694
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,909
Christ, now what?

695
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,240
Wait, where's Jack?

696
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,320
Baby, what are you doing
out here all by yourself?

697
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,352
Mommy!

698
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,437
- Jack.
- Jack!

699
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,557
Oh, my God.

700
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,035
What is wrong
with you two?

701
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,799
Why is your brother out here
by himself?

702
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,016
- No, it didn't happen that way.
- What is this?

703
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,872
While the cat's away,
the mice will play?

704
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,320
Isn't that right?

705
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,976
I'm seriously disappointed
in both of you.

706
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,595
No, there was this sound,
and I got sick,

707
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,200
and then you called
and yelled at me.

708
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,039
Honey, what are you
talking about?

709
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,515
We couldn't even get through,
and believe me, we tried.

710
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,416
She's telling the truth, Dad.
Something weird is going on.

711
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,080
I don't want to hear
your excuses either, Benny.

712
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,554
I'm gonna take him upstairs.

713
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,638
I'll leave you
to deal with these two.

714
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,399
Holy shit.

715
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,510
They should have been put back
in the barn hours ago.

716
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,016
You haven't even fed them yet,
have you?

717
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,874
- Dad, I tried, but...
- What do you mean, you tried?

718
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,311
Do you have any idea
how much those animals cost us?

719
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,591
They are alpacas!

720
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,994
Alpacas.

721
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,680
Dad...

722
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,675
I mean, should we, like,
try to warn him.

723
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,520
Warn him about what?

724
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,509
Sam?

725
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,678
Come on.
Come on.

726
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,155
Sam?
Here, boy.

727
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,394
Stupid goddamn dog.

728
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,636
You too, huh?

729
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,320
You know,
if I could just get

730
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,194
a little consideration
around here,

731
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,754
just a little support,

732
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,952
it would be
greatly fucking appreciated.

733
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,513
Dad's acting weird, right?

734
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,835
You noticed?

735
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Where's Sam?

736
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,798
T-They must have got him.

737
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,354
They?

738
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,915
Uh, what the fuck
are you talking about?

739
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,793
They, them, it.

740
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,877
That thing that has been
fucking this place up.

741
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,990
I mean, come on, Dad.

742
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,336
Don't pretend that
you haven't noticed.

743
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,239
Nothing has been
fucking this place up.

744
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,636
Why are you so in denial?

745
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,594
Okay, you know, I've had it
with your drama, Lavinia,

746
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,838
so do me a favor and get
the fuck out of my sight, okay?

747
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,793
No, no, actually,
I'll save you the trouble

748
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,116
and get the fuck
out of yours!

749
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,994
Look, he doesn't mean it.

750
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,839
Do you still have
that girlfriend in Aylesbury?

751
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,314
Well, she wasn't
my girlfriend,

752
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,636
and I haven't seen her
in months.

753
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,797
Why?

754
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:41,040
Because we need to get
the hell out of here.

755
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,990
Look.

756
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,509
Make him really scary.

757
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,560
Oh, yes.

758
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,591
What?

759
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,597
Uh, are you okay?

760
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,757
No, I just blew up
at Lavinia.

761
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,520
I don't think I'll be winning
any "father of the year" awards.

762
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,394
Oh, she's that age.
She's just impossible.

763
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,075
Aah!

764
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,351
Aah!

765
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,590
Aah!

766
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,916
No, baby.
No more.

767
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,236
We need to call a plumber
or an exterminator.

768
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,239
Drains got shit
growing in them.

769
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,112
So many crumbs on the bed.

770
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,516
Do you think
Sam is with Grandpa?

771
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,758
No, baby, Grandpa is in heaven,
and Sam just,

772
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,156
I don't know, he found a friend
or went for a walk.

773
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,715
But he was scared.
He was growling.

774
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,797
I could see all of his teeth
like this.

775
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,677
- Don't do that face.
- Oh, God. What is that smell?

776
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,111
What smell?
We washed everything.

777
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,039
What is it, like...
like damp or drains?

778
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,514
No, I-I've been smelling it

779
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,793
ever since the night
that thing hit the farm.

780
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,038
Maybe it's, like, the black mold
in the basement coming up.

781
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,833
It's exactly the same smell

782
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,599
as the cancer ward
where my father was.

783
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,552
You know, death, disinfectant.

784
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,576
The cancer smell. Rotting milk.
You know the smell.

785
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,056
You know the cancer smell
better than anybody.

786
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,176
And now the dog has vanished
off the face of the Earth,

787
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,200
so connect those dots.

788
00:59:50,201 --> 00:59:51,681
I told you
Sam was with Grandpa!

789
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,996
No, he's not.
Oh, my God, I just...

790
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,679
Ugh!
Stop saying that!

791
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,076
No, no, no, Jack, Jack,
Sam is fine.

792
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,190
Is he really?

793
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,656
Honey, would you please
take it easy?

794
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,336
It's a miracle the hospital
even let you go home.

795
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,591
I just have to get online.
All right?

796
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,836
I have so much work
I have to do.

797
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,872
- Daddy?
- Yeah, I'll take care of...

798
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,070
Everything's gonna be A-OK.

799
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,912
Everything's gonna be A-OK.

800
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,352
<i>Be careful not to
overwater all the plants.</i>

801
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,552
<i>Mount the spray to remind
you... it's easy to forget...</i>

802
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:43,392
<i>so try setting a timer to make
sure overwatering never occurs.</i>

803
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,514
<i>Even, steady watering is
every master gardener's secret</i>

804
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,279
<i>and the key to harvesting</i>

805
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,392
<i>those plump, juicy,
flavorful tomatoes</i>

806
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,874
<i>that last
throughout the season.</i>

807
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:59,314
Just look at you beauties.
And a month early.

808
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,319
<i>...makes for
a perfect arrangement.</i>

809
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,719
Peaches!

810
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,760
Heh.

811
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,270
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

812
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,358
You do that very well,
Theresa Peach.

813
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,996
If we went to 143-9
and kept it under the 10 handle,

814
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,838
that could actually...

815
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,634
What?
Not dollars.

816
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,720
Euros?
Christ, uh, um...

817
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,391
Then there should be
at least a two-pip spread.

818
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,717
What? What?

819
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,558
Can you hear me?

820
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,716
Hello?

821
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,840
Fuck!

822
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,671
You have got to do something
about that dish.

823
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,155
I am literally
hemorrhaging clients.

824
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,640
It should be working, sweetie.
I just checked it this morning.

825
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,752
No, it's garbling the fuck
out of everything I say.

826
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,550
Nate?

827
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,629
Nate, are you
listening to me?

828
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,115
You know, I did everything
I was supposed to do!

829
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,356
I followed every fucking rule
in the book,

830
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,871
and they still fucking taste
like shit, so you know what?!

831
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,718
Fuck that.

832
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,036
Okay!
Coming up!

833
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,436
Okay, stop it!
Stop.

834
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,874
Slam dunk!

835
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,152
You know what?! Just do
something about that dish.

836
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,839
All right.
Do you know what?

837
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,236
I'm gonna go and lie down.

838
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:45,351
But just fix that dish,
okay?!

839
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,031
Yeah, I think
it's a good idea, sweetie.

840
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,992
I should have grown barley.

841
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,997
Ain't that right, Dad?

842
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,040
<i>That is why,
in my next term as your mayor,</i>

843
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:20,279
<i>we will be undertaking the
largest infrastructure project</i>

844
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,755
<i>in our city's history
with the construction</i>

845
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,395
<i>of a freshwater reservoir
on the Miska...</i>

846
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,432
<i>Well, Katie,
you also have people</i>

847
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,591
<i>with different views on this.</i>

848
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,109
<i>You have scientists
who very much dispute it.</i>

849
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:36,279
<i>So is there climate change?</i>

850
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,710
<i>Will it go back?
Will it change back?</i>

851
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,639
<i>Probably.
I believe so.</i>

852
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,637
<i>Mankind...
I mean men and women...</i>

853
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,354
Dad?

854
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,996
- Whoa.
- Mm.

855
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,759
Pretty beautiful, huh, buddy?

856
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,079
Help me.

857
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,273
Protect me.

858
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,591
Get me out of here.

859
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,314
Jack?

860
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,309
Jack?

861
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,120
Jack?

862
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,034
Jack?

863
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,038
What's happening to them?

864
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,439
Uh, I-I don't know.

865
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,149
Go. Go. Go!

866
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,911
- Go!
- Oh, my God!

867
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,719
Mom!

868
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,595
Benny?

869
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,154
Benny.

870
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,231
Oh, my God.

871
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,070
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

872
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,634
Oh, my God.

873
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,640
Let's...

874
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,151
...take them in the house.

875
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,637
Benny, call 911.
Call an ambulance.

876
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,909
Okay.

877
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,429
Come on, hurry up.
Get the operator.

878
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:10,314
It's not working.
I can't get a dial tone.

879
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,816
What do you mean,
you can't get a dial tone?

880
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,433
Just give it to me.

881
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,797
All this static.

882
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,256
- Fuck!
- There's nothing there.

883
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,216
- I can't get a dial tone.
- How hard can it be to dial 911?

884
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,016
Yeah, I told you.
There's no one there!

885
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,111
- What are we gonna do?
- What are these sounds?

886
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,637
Fuck!

887
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,114
- Lavinny.
- Vinny.

888
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,629
Lavinia, what did you do
to yourself?

889
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,558
Lavinny.

890
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:03,796
You cocksucker.
You fucking cocksucker!

891
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,116
You cocksucker!
You cocksucker!

892
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,800
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Aah!

893
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,400
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

894
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,554
Aah! Aah! Aah!

895
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,800
Looks like she's absorbing him.

896
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:11,397
Trying to reassimilate him
into her body.

897
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,559
Don't say that.

898
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,200
Shh, it's okay.

899
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,120
I'm here, Mom.

900
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,871
I'm right here.

901
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,674
I mean, how can any of this
even be possible?

902
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,791
That thing from
the meteorite happened to them.

903
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,115
It changes
everything around it.

904
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,118
Not just matter.

905
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,150
Time as well.

906
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,874
Time,
it stretches around it,

907
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,230
like when you're approaching
a black hole, right?

908
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,136
I mean... I mean, how long
have we been sitting here?

909
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,391
How long has it been since Dad
went out to the car?

910
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,317
God, I think she's trying
to talk to us.

911
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,998
What was that, Mom?

912
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,189
No, this is useless.

913
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,416
- We've got to get help.
- No, wait.

914
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,920
We're gonna die
in this fucking place.

915
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,756
The, uh,

916
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,113
car is not happening.

917
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,231
What do you mean,
the car is not happening?

918
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,794
What does that mean?

919
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,799
Something sucked the charge
out of the battery overnight.

920
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,115
Probably the same thing

921
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:42,039
that's screwing with the cells
and the computers.

922
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:46,074
It's like
an electromagnetic field.

923
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,555
And you believe me now?

924
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,996
I don't know
what I believe anymore.

925
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,593
Why do they keep making
that sound?!

926
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,936
I don't think they like
the sunlight, Dad.

927
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,714
- I think it's hurting them.
- We've got to do something.

928
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,956
Help me get them
up the stairs.

929
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,359
Easy does it.

930
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,675
You got her?
You got her?

931
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:32,756
Yeah.

932
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,519
Lavinia,
put the mattress down.

933
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,836
Mom.

934
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,560
Uh, we're here, Mom.

935
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,034
It's gonna be okay.

936
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,833
Daddy...

937
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,318
You want me to get you
some water?

938
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,992
Something's happening
to the alpacas.

939
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,914
You two stay here with Jack
and your mother.

940
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,997
Everything's under control.

941
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,954
Dad?

942
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,632
You son of a bitch.

943
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,036
You're gonna
leave my family alone now.

944
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,312
You're gonna
leave my family alone.

945
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,113
Haven't we been through
enough?

946
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,197
Haven't we?

947
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,593
Aah!

948
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,596
Aaaah!

949
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,235
Aah!

950
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,114
Aah!
Aaaah!

951
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,956
Shooting stopped.

952
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,356
I hope he's okay.

953
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,800
Him?

954
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,639
And are we okay?
Is any of this okay?

955
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,991
I can't take this.

956
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,996
Make it stop.

957
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,599
We've got to get
off this farm.

958
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,040
Tonight.

959
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,075
Dad.

960
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,874
Go downstairs, both of you.

961
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,240
- But...
- Just do as I say, please.

962
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,752
What are you gonna do?

963
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:16,915
Handle it.

964
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:29,913
Like you handled
the alpacas?

965
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,029
Get out.

966
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,279
Come on.

967
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,118
You've done all you could.

968
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,754
I'm sorry, Mom.

969
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,917
Sorry, Jack.

970
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,680
- Love you, Dad.
- I love you too.

971
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,031
Theresa baby,

972
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:14,994
I'm really trying
to do my best.

973
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,633
Shh.

974
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:55,315
You will always be
my golden lady.

975
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,551
Now, you want to know
what I'm gonna do?

976
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,560
I'm gonna go outside, and I'm
gonna find you some help.

977
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,876
I promise.

978
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,560
And then we're gonna take that
trip we've been talking about.

979
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,193
Okay, baby?

980
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,273
Oh, yeah.

981
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,551
That's what we're gonna do.

982
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,274
Holy shit,
that's what we're gonna do.

983
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,238
That's what
we're gonna do.

984
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,316
I don't care about
someone identifying

985
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,000
fucking contamination
in the groundwater!

986
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:51,431
The contracts have already
been signed.

987
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,718
- Do you think those...
- If you'll follow me.

988
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,036
Would you like
a glass of water?

989
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,560
No, thank you.

990
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,637
That's actually
why I'm here.

991
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,240
...half the drinking
water for the East Coast!

992
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,400
Ward!

993
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,840
Can you come here for a sec?

994
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:19,552
You know Jake.

995
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,716
Tell him.

996
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,195
Found these
by the Gardner place.

997
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,120
Oh, my God.

998
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:36,750
What happened to them?
They look burned.

999
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,836
I don't know.

1000
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,314
Jake said he found them
bunched up

1001
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,511
like they were
running from something.

1002
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,712
Got a couple birds in there,
a white-tail, rabbit.

1003
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,160
Got a fucking cat.

1004
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,115
It looks like
radiation burns.

1005
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,480
Shut up!

1006
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,151
What's your problem?
Come on.

1007
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,635
Go get the tack.

1008
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,672
Well, I, uh...

1009
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,712
It's real dark
back there, so...

1010
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,956
And?

1011
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,674
I'll just
go get the tack, then.

1012
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,633
Benny, just be careful.

1013
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,637
I don't want to
lose you too.

1014
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,160
Come on.
Shh, shh, shh.

1015
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:45,080
Leech. Nightmare.
Leprous spellcaster.

1016
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,434
Asshat.

1017
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,674
Comet.

1018
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,913
Whoa!
Steady, boy. Steady.

1019
01:24:22,281 --> 01:24:24,637
Comet, steady.
Be steady.

1020
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,434
Steady.

1021
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,955
Jesus, Benny, you nearly
gave me a heart attack.

1022
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,719
Com, steady.
Come on.

1023
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,336
- Comet...
- What's wrong with the horse?

1024
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,736
There's nothing wrong
with the horse.

1025
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,816
Right now Comet is the last
thing you need to be afraid of.

1026
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:40,311
Fuck!
No, Comet.

1027
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:41,840
Fuck.

1028
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,680
Looks like we're gonna
have to walk out of here.

1029
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,120
In the dark?

1030
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,356
Through 12 miles
of ancient woodland?

1031
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:08,360
What are you doing?
We have to get out of here.

1032
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,736
Sam, is that you?

1033
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,717
Benny.
Benny!

1034
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,080
Fuck!

1035
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:16,916
He sounds hurt.

1036
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,400
Hold on, boy!

1037
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,636
- What are you doing?
- We can't just leave him.

1038
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,558
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

1039
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,080
I have to, all right?

1040
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,976
I'll put him in the bucket,
and then you can pull him up.

1041
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,832
No, Benny...

1042
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,236
- Whoa! Whoa.
- Fuck this.

1043
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,840
No, give me your hand.
It is just a dog.

1044
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,161
- Please give me your hand.
- It's gonna take two minutes.

1045
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,992
Idiot.

1046
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,835
Benny!

1047
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,234
God, jeez.

1048
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,954
Smells like something died
down here.

1049
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,874
Sam?

1050
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,037
Come on!

1051
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:06,077
I-I can see him moving.

1052
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,376
What is it?
What do you see?

1053
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,394
No!
No, no, no!

1054
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:16,715
No!

1055
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:28,909
Benny!

1056
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,839
No!

1057
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No.
Aah!
I have been looking all over
for you!
You expect me to do
everything on my own, huh?

1058
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,440
The both of you.

1059
01:26:41,441 --> 01:26:42,669
I mean, whatever happened

1060
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,315
to the good old-fashioned
concept of teamwork?!

1061
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,352
If we could all just
pull together

1062
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,119
just once
for the sake of your mother.

1063
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:52,995
Daddy!
You're hurting me!

1064
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:58,389
Honey.
Honey, I'm not that.

1065
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:01,638
No, I'm not a monster.

1066
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:04,752
I know I'm not my dad.
I know.

1067
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,679
Please don't make me
go in there.

1068
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,880
I promise.
I'll do whatever you want.

1069
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,995
I'll even
clean up my room.

1070
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:31,919
Well, it's like I said,
Lavinia.

1071
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,838
- We're a family.
- No.

1072
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:38,557
Now, if there's one thing that
families do, they stay together.

1073
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:42,230
Now feed your mother.

1074
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,999
Dad!

1075
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:46,595
Please!

1076
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,797
Please!

1077
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,880
But, Dad!

1078
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,151
You seeing this?

1079
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:12,759
Wait,
is that Lavinia's horse?

1080
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,999
I put
your favorite movie on.

1081
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,590
I know this one by heart.

1082
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:48,216
<i>You have a little something
in your eyes, you know?</i>

1083
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,200
<i>Oh.</i>

1084
01:28:49,201 --> 01:28:54,639
I think
after Roman Colosseum...

1085
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:59,916
...we should go Corsica,

1086
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:04,159
Malta, Greek Isles.

1087
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,711
Greek Isles are the best.

1088
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:12,713
Dad!

1089
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:15,832
Please!

1090
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,396
Lavinia!

1091
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Lavinia!
Lavinia!

1092
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,155
You never know.

1093
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,275
Mr. Gardner?

1094
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,199
Lavinia?

1095
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:10,152
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1096
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:21,715
It's you.
Toxologist.

1097
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,274
I'm the hydrologist, sir,
yeah.

1098
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:26,233
Um, we came to make sure
you're okay.

1099
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,714
That's very kind of you.

1100
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,434
We've been having a hard time,
you know?

1101
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:35,231
The car and telephone
and Wi-Fi.

1102
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,636
Heh.
Life in the sticks.

1103
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,273
Come in.

1104
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,676
Theresa will be happy
to see you.

1105
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:44,315
I'm hungry!

1106
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,520
I'm hungry.

1107
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:52,075
Mom. Mom.

1108
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:54,954
- Mommy!
- I'm hungry.

1109
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,635
What happened to your arms?

1110
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,717
It's just a rash.

1111
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,154
Where's your wife?

1112
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:09,760
She's right there.

1113
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:21,918
And the rest
of your family?

1114
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:25,590
Everybody's here.
We all stick together.

1115
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,757
What?

1116
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:33,431
Theresa says,
"Except for Benny.

1117
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:37,196
Benny lives
in the well now."

1118
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:45,034
Drink?
I'm having one.

1119
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,117
- Lavinia!
- Mom!

1120
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,680
Lavinia!

1121
01:31:50,681 --> 01:31:52,035
Mom, stop!

1122
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:55,553
Ward!

1123
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,600
Out of the way.

1124
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,959
No!

1125
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,753
Please, Mommy!

1126
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,598
No, no!

1127
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,678
Daddy...

1128
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:46,117
They're not my family.

1129
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,075
Daddy...

1130
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:59,278
Lavinia.
Lavinia! Lavinia.

1131
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:00,436
Come here.

1132
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,798
All right.
It's gonna be okay, all right?

1133
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,036
You're gonna be okay.
I mean...

1134
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,594
Fuck!
I'm gonna carry you.

1135
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:11,616
I'm gonna carry you outside
in the patrol car, okay?

1136
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:13,279
I got you.
Oh, God.

1137
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,551
You're okay.

1138
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,831
Okay, we're almost there.

1139
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,392
The color.

1140
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,440
Ward!

1141
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:36,789
No!

1142
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,115
Dad!

1143
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:45,198
Fuck!
You shot my dad! Look!

1144
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,311
Look what you did!

1145
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:50,960
Dad.

1146
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,592
Beautiful.

1147
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:05,917
Like a flower.

1148
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:07,679
It's gonna be okay, Dad, now.

1149
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:10,997
You can help us.

1150
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,953
Three Charlie one seven.
I've got a code 33.

1151
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,992
D-Don't...

1152
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:17,793
Don't...

1153
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:20,719
Please don't leave me.

1154
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,320
Daddy?

1155
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,039
Daddy?

1156
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:35,280
I'm not getting anything.
We've got to get out of here.

1157
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,879
We're not
getting out of here.

1158
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,310
None of us are.

1159
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:43,036
That thing won't let us.

1160
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:45,151
Come on, look, that...
that's silly.

1161
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,896
There's nothing stopping us
from getting up and leav...

1162
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,436
What the hell was that?

1163
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,876
It sounded like it came
from Ezra's cabin.

1164
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:00,776
We can't leave him out there
on his own.

1165
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,359
Ward, give me a hand.

1166
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:06,158
Lavinia.

1167
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,953
I'm not going with you.

1168
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,519
We've got to go.

1169
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:14,359
I'm sorry, we've got to go.
You... You can't stay here.

1170
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,719
I live here.

1171
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:27,720
I'm gonna come back for you.

1172
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,319
I'll be back.

1173
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:43,952
<i>Nothing.</i>

1174
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:51,591
<i>Nothing.
Nothing.</i>

1175
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:53,916
<i>Nothing.</i>

1176
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:56,395
- Ezra?
<i>- Cold and wet.</i>

1177
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:57,440
You in there?

1178
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:00,274
<i>But it burns.</i>

1179
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:04,674
I'm going in.

1180
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:10,160
<i>Sucking the life
out of everything.</i>

1181
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:15,914
<i>It came down in the rock.</i>

1182
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:17,917
Ezra?

1183
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:19,917
<i>It lives in the well.</i>

1184
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:22,236
<i>It grew down there.</i>

1185
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:24,590
Ezra?

1186
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:27,633
<i>Poisoning everything.</i>

1187
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:33,840
<i>Changing everything</i>

1188
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:37,635
<i>into something like the world
it came from.</i>

1189
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:43,631
<i>Into what it knows.</i>

1190
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:49,119
<i>We all know it's coming,
but we can't get away.</i>

1191
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:55,520
<i>It's got everything
that lives.</i>

1192
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:58,917
<i>They all drunk the water.</i>

1193
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:03,354
<i>It got strong.</i>

1194
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,800
Sheriff.

1195
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:07,992
<i>Fed itself on them.</i>

1196
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,635
<i>It came from the stars...</i>

1197
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,434
Skin's all...

1198
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:18,400
<i>...where things
ain't like they are here.</i>

1199
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:23,677
<i>It's just a color.</i>

1200
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:27,794
<i>But it burns.</i>

1201
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:33,791
<i>It sucks, and it burns.</i>

1202
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,320
Sheriff!
No! Sheriff!

1203
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,155
<i>It burns.</i>

1204
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,954
Sheriff?

1205
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,800
Sheriff?

1206
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,150
Lavinia?

1207
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:17,593
It's so beautiful.

1208
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:10,994
Lavinia!

1209
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,955
<i>No, Jack!</i>

1210
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,231
<i>It's you, Jack.</i>

1211
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:40,239
<i>Now it's Lavinia.</i>

1212
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:41,999
<i>There's something wrong
with Jack!</i>

1213
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:45,112
<i>Why does it matter how far away
it is? Look at him.</i>

1214
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:59,036
Are you looking
at my legs?

1215
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:00,799
You're dead, Nathan!

1216
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:02,559
It's no big deal.

1217
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,913
Don't make... Stay away.

1218
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:18,960
<i>Daddy!</i>

1219
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:30,111
No! No!

1220
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,157
<i>I hope the dammed water
that covers this place</i>

1221
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:26,112
<i>will be very deep.</i>

1222
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,399
<i>But even then...</i>

1223
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:34,077
<i>...I will never drink it.</i>

1224
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:08,033
<i>There are only a few of us that
remember the strange days now.</i>

1225
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,632
<i>What touched this place
cannot be quantified</i>

1226
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:16,832
<i>or understood
by human science.</i>

1227
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:30,596
<i>It was just a color
out of space...</i>

1228
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:37,035
<i>...a messenger from realms
whose existence stuns the brain</i>
