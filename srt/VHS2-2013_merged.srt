00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,963
- Hey! ( speaking Spanish )
- ( cameraman whispering ) Shh shh shh!

9
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,406
No. No no no.

10
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,164
Just be quiet.

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,491
- Cameraman: Oh shit!
- Aw, man, fucking...

12
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,847
Shit. Shit. Shit.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,923
- Shit.
- Man: Hey! Hey!

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,242
- Get the fuck back here!
- ( car door opens )

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,880
- Hey, give me that fucking camera!
- ( car starts )

16
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,283
-( bangs )
- ( tires screech )

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,644
Cameraman: Yeah, so you're
watching that footage I sent?

18
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,040
Man:
Yeah, I fucking saw it. You--

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,890
Cameraman: So as you probably guessed,
your wife hired me to get that.

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,924
My problem is if I show it to her,
she stops paying me.

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,691
So I was thinking you might want
to make a counter-offer there.

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,922
Oh, and whatever number
you come up with,

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,560
you can put 300 bucks on top
for the dent you put in my car.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,291
-( Indistinct shouting )
- Well, you scratched the paint anyway.

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,886
You know what? If I don't hear from you
by tomorrow, your wife gets that file.

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,690
- Goodbye.
- ( phone beeps )

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,605
- So what's the deal now?
- Ah, probably nothing.

28
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,240
Just this woman thinks
her son is missing.

29
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,131
He hasn't been to class in a week.
He won't answer her calls.

30
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,726
He's probably passed out
in a pile of beer cans.

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,008
In which case we're gonna
take the kid on a road trip

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,243
and rack up some expenses, 'cause we're
getting 1,000 bucks a day on this one.

33
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,725
Turn left up here.

34
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,161
- Woman: Your button cam's working?
- Yeah, it's working.

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,090
Woman:
This is it?

36
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,167
Yeah.

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,089
Woman: It doesn't look like
anyone's home.

38
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,730
She couldn't give you a key?

39
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,008
She doesn't have one.
She said the lock

40
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,606
on the back window's busted,
so maybe we can get in that way.

41
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,684
- Woman: And the cops haven't been here?
- No, the cops don't give a shit

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,241
about some college kid
who's missing for a couple of days.

43
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,124
( Distant barking )

44
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,009
Man: Here.

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,367
- ( Metal clanks )
-( unzips )

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,682
- ( distant bang )
- Woman: ls there someone in there?

47
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,047
- ( Crowbar clanks )
- Here. Come on, give me the cam.

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,202
There's nothing there. See?

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,806
Woman: It sure as fuck
sounded like there's something in there.

50
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,485
Man:
It's an old house.

51
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,251
Besides, if there is somebody in there,
I'm gonna want to talk to 'em.

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,050
(whispers )
Here.

53
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,680
( Low rumbling, creaking )

54
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,441
Ow.

55
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,364
- Man: You all right?
- Ow.

56
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,091
Just great. Ow.

57
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,844
Man:
You okay?

58
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,008
( Static buzzing )

59
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,809
Woman: Huh.

60
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,250
- Man: Um...
- What?

61
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,641
You know what? Stay in here, okay?
I'm gonna go check

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,644
the rest of this apartment and make sure
no one else is in here, okay?

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,325
- You got your gun?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,687
All right, good.

65
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,571
Just-- just, um, pull anything
relevant onto the drive.

66
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,324
Okay? And record everything.

67
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,403
That was part of the deal.
She likes me to do that.

68
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,369
Well, you took my camera.

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,090
Man:
Oh. Then...

70
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,848
All right, so I'll be right back.
Just, um--

71
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,361
just-- I don't know,
see what's on that computer, okay?

72
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,364
If it's encrypted, we can take it home.
If not, just pull what you can.

73
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,806
Got it.

74
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,885
( Water dripping )

75
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,248
( rustling )

76
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,851
- Man on recording: Show her tits!

( door creaks )

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,446
( man on computer sighs )
I found a new one.

79
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,524
It's third or fourth generation
from the quality.

80
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,684
L-- I got it from some guy
down in Little Armenia

81
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,569
with a pawn shop.

82
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,166
He is definitely not the type
of guy you usually see

83
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,766
on here trading with us,
but I think he's somebody

84
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,610
who's worth checking in on again.

85
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,491
(thrumming )

86
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,608

( hissing )

88
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,528
Okay.
That's fucking weird.

89
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,762
Man on computer:
Most of his collection, I would say,

90
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,208
was snuff and CP, but he had
at least one that was the real thing.

91
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,368
I don't even think
he knew what it was.

92
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,204
' Anyway...

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,802
-( beeping )
- ( distorted voices )

98
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,730
A little bit of redness,

99
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,884
some irritation, but it looks okay.

100
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,804
- How's it working?
- Guy: It's good.

101
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,645
Um, yeah, I can see,
but what about my other eye?

102
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,802
- Follow.
- Okay.

103
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,724
(whirring )

104
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,928
You can't see anything
out of your biological eye?

105
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,487
- No.
- Okay.

106
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,290
How about now?

107
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,568
Yeah. I mean, it's a little better.

108
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,643
It's just kind of blurry and shadowy.

109
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,002
Yeah. All right.

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,482
Well, because your prosthesis is
attached directly to your visual cortex,

111
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,365
your real eye's essentially
battling with your camera eye

112
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,891
to give you input right now.

113
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,008
So when your brain gets used
to having that chip in there,

114
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,766
you should start to see more and more
out of your uninjured eye again.

115
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,207
Until then
you might see some glitches.

116
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,402
What do you mean by glitches?

117
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,528
Well, this is just being tested now.

118
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,445
Eye injuries like yours are quite rare.

119
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,080
So that's why we've installed
a recording chip

120
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,130
into the eye itself so we can
test the data that it's receiving.

121
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,964
Guy:
Right. Yeah, about that.

122
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,248
- Yes?
- Oh my God.

123
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,324
So if I want private time,
what do I do?

124
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,086
- How do I turn this off?
- Uh, well, you can't.

125
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,129
But that's just for this trial period.

126
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,487
I mean, you can't expect
the KPG Corporation

127
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,650
to just give you this implant
and not expect to test its data.

128
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,045
( Guy sighs )
Of course not.

129
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,680
So you guys are gonna sit around
and watch me take shits?

130
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,446
I'd say that's a fair compromise,
Mr. Middleton.

131
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,046
You can read a newspaper during,
or something.

132
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,726
- Mm-hmm.
- So make an appointment for next week.

133
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,240
We'll see how it's working.
Call me if you have any concerns.

134
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,765
All right.
Thank you.

- All right.

141
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,648
- Sure you gonna be okay, bud?
- Yeah, dude, I'm good. I'm good.

142
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,245
All right, give me a shout
if you need anything.

143
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,890

and a fucking bloody person, okay?

You're the doctor.

Look, I'm coming in there tomorrow

Hey, are you in there?

Look, I can see you
through the peephole.

216

Middleton: Weren't you
at the doctor's office yesterday?

217
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,241
Yeah.

218
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,527
Okay, so what's the deal?
Are you following me?

219
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,371
I'm not following you. I--

220
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,363
look, just open the door.

221

I don't mean to be rude,

222

- but it's kind of weird, you know?
- Look, are you seeing weird stuff?

223
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,323
Like people who look dead?

224
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,409
You should really open the door.

Yeah, come on in.

229

- Thanks.

230
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,130
Clarissa:
Do you have any beer?

231
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,044
Middleton: I do. Yes.

232
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,170
What about painkillers?
Did the doctor give you any?

233
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,368
No, I'm not actually in any pain.

234
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,249
I'll just take a beer then.

235
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,768
Look, Clarissa,
I'm actually on my way out of here.

236
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,003
Dude, you're not gonna get anywhere
if you don't hear what I have to say.

237
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,640
Just give me a beer,
get one for yourself.

238
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,609
You're gonna need it.

239
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,569

- Thanks.
- Sure.

243
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,448
I was born deaf.

244
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,762
When I was 16
my parents put me up

245
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,644
for a new cochlear implant.

246
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,244
It worked, obviously.

247
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,682
But I began to be able to pick up
certain frequencies in my environments.

248
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,248
What happened
to your eye anyway?

249
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,641
(sighs)
I was in a, um--

250
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,802
in a car accident.

251
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,563
So who's the little girl?

252
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,609
Middleton:
What little girl?

253
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,728
There's a little girl here.

254
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,201
I heard her crying when I came in.

255
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,089
But you know...

256
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,442
I don't hear her now.

257
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,127
Some people never
hear them or see them--

258
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,567
maybe once in their entire lives,

259
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,051
if they're open to it.

260
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,089
So...

261
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,005
when you can sense them,
they know.

262
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,969
They can tell.

263
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,048
That's why I wanted to find you...

264
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,201
to warn you.

265
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,966
Middleton:
Warn me about what?

266
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,490
Yeah.

267
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,609
The more you interact with them,
the more they can

268
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,330
touch you,

269
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,124
hurt you,

270
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,486
stuff.

271
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,369
Middleton: Well, tomorrow
I'm gonna get this fuckin' thing

272
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,488
taken out of my head
and that'll be that, right?

273
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,085
Don't be so sure.

274
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,647
Have you ever done
anything bad to anybody?

275
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,688
Look, if you get
the implant taken out,

276
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,569
they're still gonna be there.

277
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000

You're just not gonna
be able to see 'em.
I don't know,
maybe that's better.
Well, I guess-- oh shit!

278
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,203
Um, I don't want
to alarm you right now,

279
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,806
but there's a fucking creepy dude
standing right behind you.

280
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,088
I know. I can hear him.

281
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,801
- Do you know him or something?
- He was my uncle.

282
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,167
Oh, of course, right.
I mean--

283
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,244
well, I didn't mean to call him
creepy, but I mean--

284
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,283
- He wasn't a nice person.
- ( dance music playing )

285
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,369
Okay.

286
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,122
- Jesus.
- I know how to make him go away.

287
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,004
- Just focus on me.
- Okay.

All right, you scientist assholes,

294
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,769
I want a copy of that footage.

295
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,088
Like, I want you to put it
on a disc or something,

296
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,571
but don't watch it.

297
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,604
Just get it to me, okay?

298
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,405

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,764
It couldn't have been reals.

353
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,321
Okay.

354
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,244
Is there anything on that computer?

355
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,210
I'm cloning his hard drive now.
It shouldn't take too long.

356
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,203
Here, look at this.

357
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,688
Tape is the final link for me.

358
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,049
Um, I know a lot of you
have posted that

359
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,806
it only affects you if you play it
in a correct sequence.

360
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,567
But I've been experimenting on--

361
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,404
( lowers volume )

362
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,211
- Is this the kid?
- Yeah, that's him.

363
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,011
I found some notebooks in his room,
kind of like journals.

364
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,686
Mostly just nonsense though.
I'm going through them right now.

365
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,046
Why don't you, like,
keep looking at these tapes?

366
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,202
The kid's a collector.
I don't know. Who knows?

367
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,964
Maybe there's something
relevant on them.

368
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,406
Oh.

369
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,164
Um... okay.

370
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,687
Man on computer:
We're all just electromagnetic energy.

371
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,969
If these analog tapes capture
the images of the supernatural,

372
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,647
they can affect our cerebral cortex.
They-- they--

373
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,406
- ( clicks )
- ( static continues )

374
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,561
( electronic hum )

375
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,886
- ( beeps )
- ( birds chirping)

376
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,521
( beeps )

377
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,610
(cellphone chiming )

378
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,726
Guy:
Hey, babe.

379
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,882
Amy:
Don't "Hey, babe" me, Mike Sullivan.

380
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,089
- We're supposed to be having breakfast.
- Mike: Yeah, but it's a beautiful day.

381
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,930
I just want to take the bike
out for a spin.

382
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,481
Amy:
I wanted you to take me for a spin.

383
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,007
You know, you ride that bike
more than you ride me.

384
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,091
Mike: Yeah, but you know the bike
is just a physical thing, babe.

385
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,288
(Amy chuckles )
Mm-hmm.

386
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,330
Now tell me you love me.

387
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,608
- I love you.
- ( woman chuckles )

388
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,290
Okay, good enough.

389
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,807
- Be safe, babe.
- All right, bye.

390
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,762
( Techno music playing in headphones )

391
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,528
( bike rattling )

392
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,361
Help! Help me! Please!

393
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,805
- Are you okay?
' MY boyfriend!

394
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,650
- You have to help my boyfriend!
- ( Mike mumbles)

395
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,002
- ( veins )
- I'm getting help.

396
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,288
No, please! Help Dan!

397
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,167
- Mike: Oh God!
- ( woman retching )

398
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,971
Mike: Hey.
Hey hey hey, stay with me.

399
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,804
- ( Retching )
- Mike: Shit!

400
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,201
Fuck! God.

401
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,562
( Faint growl )

402
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,443
- ( faint growling)
- Who's there?

403
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,571
The police are right behind me,
so you'd better run!

404
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,368
I got a big fucking stick!

405
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,648
(growling, moaning)

406
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,564
What the fuck?

407
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,762
Oh.
( panting )

408
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,530
Hey hey, come on, we've got to go!

409
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,126
- ( Roars )
- Whoa, aah!

410
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,691
- ( Screaming )
- ( chomping )

411
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,330
Ow, get off!

412
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,249
( Hisses, gr0al1iﬂ9 )

413
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,162
( distorted gibberish )

414
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,686
Die, you fucking bitch!

415
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,763
You fucking bitch!

416
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,130

Help. Help!

425

(coughing )

426
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,845

427

434
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,408
( silence )

435
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,609
Woman: Honey, are you sure
you know where you're going?

436
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,764
- This does not look like a trail.
- Man: Of course I know where I'm going.

437
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,366
- Just trust me.
- Woman: How can you tell?

438
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,171
- Man: Well, it used to be a trail.
- There's no trail here.

439
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,729
Man: This doesn't look
familiar to you at all?

440
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,729
Woman:
No, not whatsoever.

441
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,604
I mean it's pretty,
I'll give you that much.

442
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,404
Man:
Holy shit.

443
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,130
Woman:
Oh my God.

444
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,565
Is he...?

445
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,685
I think so.

446
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,888
It looks like
he's been bit by something.

447
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,371
Yeah.

448
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,122
Will you check his pulse,
just to be sure?

449
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,126
Nothing.

450
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,442
My God, I mean,
what could have done this?

451
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,681
Man:
I don't know.

452
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,763
I don't know.
An animal?

453
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,566
Oh, um, yes, hello.
We found someone.

454
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,246
He's, like, covered in blood
and there's no pulse.

455
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,609
We're on the bike trails and--

456
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,007
I mean, it looks like he's been
bit by something.

457
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,889
- It's a bite, right?
- That would be my guess.

458
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,483
Um, what state park is this?
I don't remember.

459
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,843
- This is Gold Stone State Park.
- Yeah, we're at Gold Stone State Park.

460
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,243
Um, but I'm not sure exactly
where we are here.

461
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,488
It's the--
the trail off of Highway One.

462
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,847
Yeah, on the trails
off of Highway One.

463
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,162
- Okay.
- They're sending somebody?

464
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,806
They're gonna send--
connect us with a park ranger.

465
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,325
Okay.

466
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,766
Holy shit.

00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,127
- God.
- ( Mike wheezes )

468
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,525
- Wait a minute.
- Honey, what are you doing?

469
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,284
I think I heard a noise.

470
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,169
- What kind of noise?
- I don't know.

471
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,482

532
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,329

534
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,487
( teddy bear moans )

535
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,040
- ( moans )
- ( sobbing continues )

536
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,284
Amy on phone: Mike?

537
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,683
Mike? Mi-ike?

538
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,171
Hello?

539
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,129
Mike?
Mike, Mike, Mike.

540
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,890
Are you okay?

541
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,402
( Sighs )
You butt-dialed me, goofball.

542
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,845
Oh well, I love you, baby.

543
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,526
Can't wait for you
to get home. Bye.

544
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,364
(Mike whimpering)

545
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,086
( chomping )

546
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,402
( Mike gags, whimpering )

547
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,849
(gunshot)

548
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,165
( static, electronic hum )

549
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,730
( clatters )

550
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,204
Larry:
Hey, how's it going in here?

551
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,091
( Static buzzing )

552
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,844
Larry: Hey-

553
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,967
( static increases )

554
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,406
( both gasp)

555
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,370
sorfY-

556
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,329
I must've fallen asleep.

557
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,243
Oh my God.

558
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,409
Your nose is bleeding.

559
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,847
Don't tilt your head back.
It'll just go down your throat.

560
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,361
This one of your migraines?

561
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,807
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

562
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,525
Are your pills in your purse?

563
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,489
Yeah.

564
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,601
They're not in here. Could you have
left them at your apartment?

565
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,286
I don't-- maybe. I don't know. I--

566
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,409
All right, so what do you want me to do?
We passed a drugstore on the way here.

567
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,530
I could go back,
get you some aspirin or something.

568
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,370
Ayesha: Yeah.

569
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,409
I don't feel like moving.

570
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,566
All right, well,
I feel kind of weird leaving you--

571
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,643
Just go.

572
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,522
Okay. I'll be right back.

573
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,687
( Static buzzing )

574
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,489
( creaking )

575
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,045
( static increases, stops )

576
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,929
( electronic hum )

577
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,651
( man breaking up )
Malik, I'm getting audio, but no visual.

578
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,406
- Malik: You check the connection?
- Man: Wait wait.

579
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,766
Malik:
Okay, how about now?

580
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,490
Man:
That's, um--

581
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,483
okay, we're good.

582
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,688
- Malik: We're good?
- We're good.

583
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,046
Malik:
All right.

584
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,806
Let me see.

585
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,883
All right, perfect.
Now switch to Lena-cam.

586
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,371
Man:
All right.

587
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,010
Lena:
Do you see me, gents?

588
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,371
Crystal clear.

589
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,682
Adam, can you tell?

590
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,968
Adam:
No. From here, not a thing.

591
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,804
But if I zoom in...

592
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,644
- Man: The top button, Adam.
- Malik: Well?

593
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,326
Adam: Let's just say
you really have to be looking for it.

594
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,205
( Malik, in Indonesian )
Excuse me if I'm wrong but, paradise?

595
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,931
Yes, that's correct,
our paradise.

596
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:51,450
This, all you see before you,
is temporary.

597
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,406
There is a higher order,
another plane of existence.

598
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,127
My family and I, all of my disciples

599
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,280
we're getting closer and closer
to crossing over to the promised gates.

600
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,163
You mean in a spiritual sense,
metaphorically speaking--

601
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:23,491
No, not a metaphor!
It's as literal as it gets.

602
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,450
It's here in this world.

603
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,331
It has already begun.
We're on the precipice of...

604
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,488
We're on the verge of...

605
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,444
Do you have to be so close?

606
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,280
Just doing my job here.

607
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,048
Malik:
We'd love to discuss this further,

608
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,407
but in a more suitable location.

609
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,446
I was wondering
if we could come and visit

610
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,924
your family at the commune
and continue this interview...

611
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,003
No, I'm sorry.

612
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:06,571
I do not allow nonbelievers
to enter Paradise Gates.

613
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,010
Experience has taught us
that in your eyes we are seen

614
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,131
as nothing more
than a carnival freakshow.

615
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,930
- I understand, sir, but...
- Lena: Malik.

616
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,688
Excuse me, sir, but that's why
we want your approval.

617
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:28,688
We want to show
an unbiased view of your family.

618
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,729
No editorial slant,

619
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,327
just a platform for you
to show our viewers

620
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,364
the truth behind the ideology
at Paradise Gates.

621
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,926
What do you say?

622
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,450
(tone)

623
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,887
( electronic hum )

624
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,045
( children singing in Indonesian )

625
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,688
( clicking )

626
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,564
(man, in English)
Yo, Adam.

627
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,882
- Would you pass me the spy cam?
- Where?

628
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,605
In my bag.
In the front.

629
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,001
- Sure.
- Thanks, man.

630
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,365
( Camera beeps )

631
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,363
- Here, heads up.
- Whoa!

632
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,682
You're a fucking dick,
you know that?

633
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,090
Okay, guys'

634
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,401
( speaking Indonesian )
Madame, my name is Malik.

635
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,689
- This is my crew.
- Hi, I'm Lena. I'm the producer.

636
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,729
- Hello.
- It was quite a journey.

637
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,281
Yes, we found being
too close to the city

638
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,488
was a little dangerous for Father.

639
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,689
- It's safer for us out here.
- I see...

640
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,731
We can't let any harm come to Father.

641
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,801
He's our sole shepherd
on ourjourney to immortality.

642
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,851
- You've got a large compound here.
- Yes, out of necessity.

643
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,924
- Hi, what's your name?
- This is Lydia.

644
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,242
Hi, Lydia. Oh.

645
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,090
Thank you.

646
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,406
Did the other little girls help you?

647
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,927
I'm not a girl anymore.
Father took care of--

648
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,402
Enough, Lydia.
Tend to your sisters now.

649
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,721
Please follow me.

650
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,291
( In English )
Yeah, all right.

651
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,481
Adam:
Oh, wait. Wait wait wait wait.

652
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,531
Wait.

653
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,604
Hey, Lena, you want
to upsize that thing?

654
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,966
No, this is creepy, man.
I don't want to wear this.

655
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,723
Hey, Joni.

656
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,008
This belongs to you, man.

657
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,764
Malik:
Hey, Joni, Adam, come here.

658
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,649
Adam:
Coming coming coming.

659
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,682
( Rope smacking )

660
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,371
(woman speaks Indonesian )

661
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,962
How many children are in the commune?

662
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,043
Twenty in total.

663
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,567
How about Father?
Does he have any children?

664
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,929
- We are all Father's children here.
- ( man speaking Indonesian )

665
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,524
- Our Father...
- ( clicks )

666
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,523
( speaks English )
Joni, not too bright.

667
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,170
( Speaks Indonesian )
Sorry, madame.

668
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,961
Our almighty Father has a lot
of responsibilities for his family.

669
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,121
Adam.

670
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,924
Woman:
As you spend more time with him

671
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,766
- you'll grow to appreciate our ways.
- ( distant children singing )

672
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,369
Malik: How long have you
had this building?

673
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,249
For some time.

674
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,210
Ah, here are Father's
little chosen ones.

675
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,887
( Children continue singing )

676
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,003
Would it be okay for us to film them?

677
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,845
You can film only what Father allows.

678
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,731
(Joni, in English ) Hey,
we're not the only one filming, guys.

679
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,123
( In Indonesian )
Yes, those. Security purposes.

680
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,645
Please, this way.

681
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,881
Joni: Yeah.

682
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,841
Malik:
Okay, we'll be ready to start soon, sir.

683
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,207
I'd like to start by getting
your perspective,

684
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,762
then we'll move on
to your family and the commune.

685
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,086
Are you all right?

686
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,129
( Hisses )

687
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,362
- I am fine. I am ready.
- Okay.

688
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,886
( Malik whispers in English )
Dude, can you speed things up?

689
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,330
Don't forget his. Go.

690
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,086
(whispers )
Dude, there's blood on the mic.

691
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,565
( In Indonesian ) Sir, are you sure
you're okay to do this interview?

692
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,567
I've waited a long time for this day.

693
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,564
In that case,
we'll start straightaway.

694
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,006
- I'd like to ask...
- ( retches )

695
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,249
Father:
Wait. Are you okay?

696
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,084
I'm fine.

697
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,766
All right, so as I said...

698
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,042
-( Lena retches )
- ...I'd like to begin by asking you...

699
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,049
(whispers in English )
You okay?

700
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,441
( Lena, in Indonesian )
Excuse me, sir, the restroom?

701
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,162
Go downstairs, third door on the left.

702
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,402
- Thank you.
- ( Malik, in English ) Lena, you okay?

703
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,090
Just start without me.

704
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,163
- Are you sure?
- Lena: Yeah.

705
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,527
( Father, in Indonesian )
Come on, let's start.

706
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,967
( In English )
Yeah, um...

707
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,721
Hey, you know what? Sorry.

708
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,604
You want me to go check on Lena?

709
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,125
( Father, in Indonesian )
There's no need.

710
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,930
( In English )
Just to make sure she's fine.

711
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,125
( Father, in Indonesian ) Do not be
worried, Madame will take care of her.

712
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,203
It's okay, sir. Technical issues.

713
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,521
Exactly, sir.

714
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,605
He'll do field control
and leave us to talk.

715
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,169
Well, first I must start
with a somewhat challenging question.

716
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:47,930
A question that I am sure
is on most people's minds.

717
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,765
Regarding your lifestyle,

718
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:56,211
specifically the relationship
you have with the children here.

719
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,767
What's your point?

720
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,003
- ( Distorted music playing )
-( Lena sighs ) Okay.

721
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,966
Hey, kids, where's your teacher?

722
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,001
Wow, these are really great.

723
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,769
What's this a painting of?

724
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,490
( Madame clears throat )

725
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,524
Lena: I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to just barge in.

726
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,126
Beautiful, aren't they?

727
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,203
Lena:
Yes, they are.

728
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,687
But not as beautiful
as yours will be.

729
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,286
Lena:
Excuse me?

730
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,889
No, you will bear something
very special indeed.

731
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,611
You are very blessed.

732
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,889
- Wait, don't be scared.
- ( In English ) Hey, Lena.

733
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,370
You okay?

734
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,966
- ( In Indonesian ) Excuse me, madame.
- ( In English ) Lena, what's wrong?

735
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,249
Yo. Hey, Lena.

736
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,401
What happened?

737
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,643
( In Indonesian ) In order to follow
this path you have to remain pure.

738
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,724
I can help maintain that purity.

739
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,566
They bring their wives, their children

740
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,770
so that I may wash away
their impurities.

741
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,606
Wash away their impurities?
They're still children.

742
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,604
You may see it as unnatural,

743
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,843
but we see it as a progression.

744
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,082
I see it as underage children

745
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,084
involved in what many consider
illegal behavior, sir.

746
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,322
I have blessed them.

747
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,960
They will stand by me on the front line,

748
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,646
in the heavenly glow of the gates.

749
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,604
Oh, how long they have waited.

750
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,043
Men in robes may seek
heaven in the skies.

751
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,202
But not me.

752
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,567
I do not need to look upwards.

753
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,848
I simply look ahead.

754
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,048
For paradise is right in front of me

755
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,567
and I hold the key to unlock the gates.

756
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,724
Pull with all my might,
I will open the gates of paradise.

757
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,123
- This world of ours is temporary.
- Um... Malik?

758
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,324
- This is just the beginning.
- Sorry, the battery is almost out.

759
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,369
- ( In English ) Seriously?
- My bad.

760
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,603
- I thought I charged it yesterday.
- Man! Don't worry, I got this.

761
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,650
( Speaking Indonesian )
Sir, please excuse me a moment.

762
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,041
- Father: Where are you going?
- We need a spare battery.

763
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,725
I'll be right back.

764
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,402

766
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,521

( indistinct conversation
on video feed )

769
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,162
It's been over a day, Adam.

770
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,130
(Adam speaks )

771
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,602
Listen, I need to know whether it's
going to be me or you telling Malik.

772
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,007
We owe it to him.

773
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,849
Adam:
Are you even sure it's mine?

774
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,647
- Malik and I haven't--
- Haven't what?

775
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,648
It's been a while.

776
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,728
Fuck! He's my fucking--

777
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,486
- he's my fucking best friend.
- And he's my fiancé.

778
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,010
Adam, I am pregnant
and you're the father.

779
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,850
Just cover your fucking camera.

780
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,968
( Lena crying )

781
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,242
Do you think I wanted this to happen?

782
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,564
Adam:
Hey hey, come on, come on.

783
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,324
Listen.

784
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,209
We can go see someone,

785
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,805
fix this,

786
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,803
no one's gonna know.

787
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,769
Lena:
What the fuck?

788
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,366
- Adam: What?
- Fuck you!

789
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,530
I don't need you.
I'll tell Malik myself.

790
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,324
And whether or not I keep this,

791
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,091
and whether or not he walks,
I still don't fucking need you!

792
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,969
What?

793
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,043
You heard me.

794
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,486
Fine.
Decision made.

795
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,041
Fuck me, fuck you, fuck him.

796
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,328

( P.A. echoing )
Brothers and sisters.

804
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,964
My children.

805
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,891
Lovers of my life.

806
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,526
Follow me,

807
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,685
for I have been the compass
of your souls.

808
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,131

- Even years...

810

Oh, it felt like an eternity.

But now we are approaching
the final steps.

812

Today, at this very moment,

813
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,641
- we will reach our salvation.

- The final key to Paradise is ours.

816

Father has been waiting for you,
we must go to him directly.

817

- My wives and my children.
- Take one cup each, my little ones.

818

- Don't waver from your path.
- Make sure to drink every drop.

819
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,204
Yesterday you were tainted and sullied.

820
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,682
Today you stand as angels of purity.

821
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,488
Don't be afraid, hold firm.
Guide yourself to the promised land.

822

what you're about to do...
