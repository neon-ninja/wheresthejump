1
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,711
Not too long.

2
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,735
Okay.

3
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,294
Don't get too close
to the water.

4
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:20,399
- What?
- I said don't get too close to the water.

5
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,780
- Why?
- You never know what could be in there.

6
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,849
Piranhas, maybe.

7
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,918
I don't know.

8
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,821
That's just the point,
you never know.

9
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,690
It could be necrotizing
fasciitis.

10
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,261
- What's that?
- A germ that eats your living flesh.

11
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:42,498
- Ew, that's not real.
- Is too.

12
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,334
- What's your name?
- Peter.

13
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,802
My mom and I just moved here.

14
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,804
Hi, Peter.

15
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:52,775
So, do you come here just to
warn people about piranhas?

16
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,511
No. This is my place.

17
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,980
No, this is my place.
I found it.

18
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:02,318
Um, I don't think you're the
first person to find it ever.

19
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,986
No one else has never found it.

20
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,391
I did. Besides, this place
has a name already.

21
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,726
I know that.

22
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,631
I guess we'll just have to
battle to the death over it.

23
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:20,536
- You're crazy.
- That's what they call me. Crazy Maggie.

24
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,772
Well, Maggie,

25
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,797
prepare to meet thy doom.

26
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,938
- My snail won again.
- No way.

27
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,442
- It totally did.
- Mine never wins.

28
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,913
- Yours is too distracted.
- Yours has a rocket boosters or something.

29
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:08,050
Just skills. That's
all my snail needs.

30
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,819
So how come you moved here?

31
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,455
So my mom could work
at the college.

32
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,625
We used to live a
few towns away.

33
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,928
Do you miss your old home?

34
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:23,566
Sometimes. I'm kind of glad we moved here
though because my friend lives here.

35
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,736
What about your dad?

36
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,738
That's the other
reason we moved.

37
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,407
Oh. Sorry.

38
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:36,045
- It's okay.
- Do you like it here?

39
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:41,917
I guess. It's a little
quieter than I imagined.

40
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,775
I like this place though.

41
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,625
How long have you been here?

42
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,462
- A long time.
- Do you like it here?

43
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,722
Sometimes. Right now, I do.

44
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:14,850
- Be free.
- Stay together.

45
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,075
I don't want them to get lost.

46
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,662
I think I have to go home now.
It's getting late.

47
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,726
- Do you have to? - My mom gets

48
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:30,789
worried if I stay out too late.

49
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,138
Okay.

50
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,207
Hey, I was wondering...

51
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,044
Maybe we could hang
out again sometime.

52
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,614
- Yeah, definitely.
- I live across the woods.

53
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:49,084
Where do you live?

54
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,021
How about you come here again?
To my place.

55
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,924
- My place.
- Our place.

56
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,960
Okay, cool. See you tomorrow?

57
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,484
Yep.

58
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:33,088
You know, turning your broccoli
upside down on the plate

59
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,957
isn't fooling anybody, bub.

60
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,926
What?

61
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,161
Well, you can leave it until
you've finished everything else,

62
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,931
but sooner or later, you're
gonna have to bite the bullet.

63
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:45,734
- Broccoli.
- Yes, broccoli.

64
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,804
- So go ahead and bite it.
- Broccoli is gross.

65
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:53,275
You're gross, but you don't
hear me complaining.

66
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,111
Well, somebody's just gonna
have to choke it down

67
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,048
if he ever wants to see me
make pumpkin cupcakes again.

68
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,072
- Mom.
- Mm-mm.

69
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,624
Hmm. Oh, so who's this
girl you met today?

70
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,159
- Just a girl. - Well, come on.

71
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:11,694
You have to do better than that.

72
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,629
- What's her name?
- Maggie.

73
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,297
- Maggie what?
- I don't know.

74
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,300
- Well, you should ask.
- I will, I will.

75
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,286
- Where's you meet her?
- At my place by

76
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:22,271
lost creek. She was
playing there, too.

77
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:27,276
Hmm. Your secret lair. I love that
you're hanging out with more people.

78
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,312
It's not like there are any
people to play with anyway.

79
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,948
- It's weird.
- Hey, hey.

80
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,217
What about the kids
in school, huh?

81
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,987
That's the other side of town.
There's only bill,

82
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,289
and even he's hard to get to.

83
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,825
Pete, you know why
we moved here.

84
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,693
It was tough to find this job.

85
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,696
- I know.
- And we talked about this.

86
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,999
We had to get away from
your bleeping father.

87
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,266
Don't say bleeping.

88
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,769
I didn't. I bleeped it.

89
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,204
I could tell what it was.

90
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,339
- Could you really?
- Um...

91
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:01,176
And we are lucky that grandma and
grandpa let us have this house

92
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,779
- for so little money when they moved.
- I know.

93
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:08,050
Even though mommy swore after college
she'd never move back here again.

94
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:11,053
- Mom, it's fine.
- It's okay.

95
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,790
I mean, I think this
is important for us,

96
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,826
and I just need to know that...
That you're okay.

97
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,330
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

98
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,967
"I'm okay." I mean it.

99
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,335
I think this is
important for us,

100
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,304
and I need to know that
you think so, too.

101
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,107
- Do you think so, too?
- Yes.

102
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,109
Good. I love you.

103
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,679
- I love you, too.
- Good.

104
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:40,449
Now can you take that box of cups down to
the basement like I asked you yesterday?

105
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,173
Okay.

106
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,463
Peter?

107
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,850
Dad?

108
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,285
Where are you?

109
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,309
I'm in here.

110
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,560
I miss you, Peter.

111
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,952
Can you find me?

112
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,994
This way, Peter.

113
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,589
Peter.

114
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hey, hey, hey.

115
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,023
Easy, honey. It's okay.
It's just me.

116
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,091
Easy, baby. Easy.

117
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,494
You had a bad dream. It's okay.

118
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,130
You're awake now.

119
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:51,233
- Mom.
- I know, I know.

120
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:55,304
It's over. It's okay.

121
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:58,473
Since when did you start
sleepwalking again?

122
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:02,277
Has this been happening
for a while?

123
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:07,449
Okay, well, it's over now.
It's okay.

124
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,285
- Tough night, huh?
- Yeah.

125
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,210
Yeah.

126
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,501
I mean, it was so scary and weird.
It was so real.

127
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:30,038
I think I'm in love with pop-tarts.
Like, actually in love.

128
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:34,209
That's great, bill. I could smell things,
you know? Like rotten leaves and stuff.

129
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:38,146
- Like, I could actually marry one.
- I actually felt cold.

130
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,615
Or a cheese Danish. Yeah, a
pop-tart may be a girlfriend,

131
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,417
but I'd marry a cheese Danish.

132
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,187
Have you been listening
to anything I'm saying?

133
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,689
Yeah, sure, scary
dream, blah, blah.

134
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,459
No, not just a scary dream.
More than that.

135
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,561
I've had scary dreams a
million times before.

136
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,330
This was... different.

137
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,632
Ooh, different.

138
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,768
- Never mind.
- Exactly.

139
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,071
- Peter Roland.
- Oh, sorry. Here.

140
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,641
Ah, there you finally are.
William dury?

141
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,077
- Bill.
- Excuse me?

142
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,412
It's bill.

143
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,448
Are you William dury or not?

144
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,417
Yeah, that's me.

145
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,453
Thank you.

146
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,023
- Anyways, what's your costume?
- It's a secret.

147
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:24,126
- Oh, don't be a dork.
- You'll see.

148
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,662
Fine. I'm going as the cat.

149
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,732
- The cat?
- Yeah.

150
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,702
The cat from... from what?

151
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,438
From nature. From
our neighborhood.

152
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:40,809
- The black and white one?
- Yeah.

153
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,545
That's adorable.

154
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,748
No, it's not. That's
just what it's not.

155
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,618
You don't understand. You
don't live on its street.

156
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:53,088
It waits for me. It's
always so quiet.

157
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,757
You're supposed to go as something
scary, so that's what I'm doing.

158
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,261
- I hate it.
- It's a she.

159
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,596
Okay, class, settle
down, settle down.

160
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:07,235
My name is Mr. Vernon, and I will be
replacing Mrs. "mc-creddy" for a while.

161
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:11,273
- Mrs. Mccready.
- Oh, thank you.

162
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,408
Mccready, thank you.

163
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,078
What happened to Mrs. Mccready?

164
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,713
How should I know? Shut up.
You're gonna get us into trouble.

165
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,483
Here we go.

166
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,452
Yes, uh, Peter?

167
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,354
Um, Mr. Vernon, what happened to Mrs.
Mccready?

168
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,257
I don't know. She's not
able to come in today.

169
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,627
But she was fine yesterday. She promised
to talk more about the field trip.

170
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,797
- Maybe she's sick today.
- She didn't seem sick.

171
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,632
- Peter, I only know
what they tell me,

172
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,601
and I don't know why
she's not here today.

173
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,294
But I'm sure she's gonna be
fine, so don't worry, okay?

174
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,614
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

175
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,549
Wow, you sure are a
talkative class.

176
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,586
- I told you not to be weird.
- So, I'm still new here.

177
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,156
Can anyone tell me something interesting
about living in brackenvale?

178
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,160
- Yes?
- There's a big college here.

179
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,395
Very good. That's true.
Thank you.

180
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,631
Anyone else?

181
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,334
Ah, bill, not William.

182
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,370
The woods near my
house is haunted.

183
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,307
- Ah, yes. - Yeah, I heard the

184
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:21,243
story at camp,
like, summers ago.

185
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,913
Someone is supposed to have died out
there in the woods, like, 20 years ago.

186
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,315
It's supposed to be
haunted or something.

187
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:32,821
Oh, yes? Anyone else?

188
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,657
- Yes?
- There's a shark in the lake.

189
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,692
There's a shark...

190
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:41,863
Well, not in the lake.
At the beach.

191
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:45,467
- All the time?
- Not all the time.

192
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:49,571
But they're in the ocean, so they
sometimes have to be near the beach.

193
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,807
Oh, well, that's very true. Very true.
Good, thank you.

194
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,809
Okay, good, good. Okay.

195
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:59,303
So, let's continue with the reading
that Mrs. Mccready assigned.

196
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,565
- What happened to Mr. Raimi?
- I don't

197
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,279
know. The sub said
he was just gone.

198
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,340
- Every year?
- You never see it coming.

199
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:31,279
You're like some poor, little, innocent
baby chick just walking into it.

200
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,748
You're such a heel.

201
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,201
- A what? - I heard it in

202
00:19:36,213 --> 00:19:38,653
english. It means a giant jerk!

203
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,678
You're such a dork.

204
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,564
- It's so close.
- I know.

205
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,000
And now that you're here,
it's gonna be insane.

206
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,636
We're gonna need a plan...
All the prime candy routes.

207
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,405
Pillow cases this year. No
more wimpy plastic bags.

208
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,809
This year, we're all
gonna be candy monsters.

209
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,811
Where do you get all that
Halloween stuff anyway?

210
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,879
Some kids at the cafeteria.
They didn't want it.

211
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,816
Yeah, I can see why. Some
of them are really scary.

212
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,452
Yeah. They're gonna look
awesome at my house.

213
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,477
- Can I have some?
- Yeah, but leave this one.

214
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:21,753
Hi!

215
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,036
Our pillowcases
are still packed.

216
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,704
Mom said they're
lost in the abyss.

217
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,275
Oh, don't worry. You can
borrow one of mine.

218
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:37,445
You know Mr. Queeg? That old guy who
lives by the market value time?

219
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,164
- Yeah. - I don't think he

220
00:20:39,176 --> 00:20:40,882
can see too well anymore.

221
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,851
I bet we can go to
his house twice.

222
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,919
Bill, why do you do
this to yourself?

223
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,355
- Do what? - You threw up 2.35

224
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:49,791
pounds of chocolate last year.

225
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,660
Whatever. It wasn't that much.

226
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,862
- We weighed it.
- Whatever.

227
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,464
- I was impressed.
- Whatever!

228
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,367
Anyway, are you still gonna
hang with this Maggie?

229
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,637
- Yeah, so?
- So how come I haven't met her before?

230
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,539
Well, you will.

231
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,775
- Where are you meeting her?
- By the creek again.

232
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,845
You know, my mom says we shouldn't
even be in lost creek woods.

233
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,747
She says some parts
are dangerous.

234
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,549
It's not dangerous.

235
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,319
I bet your mom would
be mad if she knew.

236
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,487
You're a loser, and
it's not dangerous.

237
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,956
It's, like, special there.

238
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,659
Oh, special.

239
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,629
Shut up. Anyway, I'm gonna ask
Maggie to trick or treat with us.

240
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,865
Great. A girl to slow us down.
We got work to do.

241
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,934
She won't slow us down.

242
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,804
She better not. The Wilkins' house
had the good candy corn last year.

243
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:39,574
If we don't make it that
far, I'm blaming you.

244
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,743
I don't want to go by the
Wilkins' house anyway.

245
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,112
What? Are you still
thinking about those kids?

246
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,048
Bill, they were huge, and they
chased us for, like, an hour.

247
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,084
Don't be a baby.

248
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:53,588
You were just as scared as me. We
were lost and we were both crying.

249
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,590
Yeah, but they
really got to you.

250
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:59,083
- They were really scary.
- Yeah.

251
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,566
Anyway, she better
not slow us down.

252
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,403
Maggie's cool, you'll see. Anyway,
if anyone slows us down, it's you.

253
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:12,574
- You run like a grandma.
- Nuh-uh. A race car grandma, maybe.

254
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:15,543
- That doesn't even make sense.
- You don't make sense.

255
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,369
Gotta go. Bye, weirdo.

256
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,429
Hey!

257
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:08,663
Where were you?

258
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,565
Jumpy much?

259
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,734
I didn't see you.

260
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,103
I thought maybe you didn't come.

261
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,672
Nah, don't worry.

262
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,941
I'm always here.

263
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,644
You scared me.

264
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,479
I can't help it if you're blind.

265
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,505
I've just been right
here the whole time.

266
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:58,206
So what are you going as?
- For what?

267
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,975
- Halloween, duh.
- I don't know.

268
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,911
Oh, come on. You have
to have some idea.

269
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:08,216
Well, I remember for
the last Halloween,

270
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,252
- I went as a werewolf Princess.
- What?

271
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,987
You heard me.

272
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,557
What does that look like?

273
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:19,060
Well... whoa. I had
the best fangs.

274
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:23,097
And my mom had this fake
bearskin rug that I cut up.

275
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:26,935
She was so mad. I had a
crown and a dress, too.

276
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,870
I was beautiful.

277
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,573
Sounds lovely.

278
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:34,242
Well, I bet it's better than
whatever lame thing you're gonna be.

279
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,011
Oh, just you wait.
I love Halloween.

280
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,680
- It's...
- It's the best.

281
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,704
Yeah.

282
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:47,922
- Do you ever think about it?
- -Think about what?

283
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:52,727
Being a kid. Like, one
day you're not anymore.

284
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,796
I guess.

285
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,232
It feels like we've
been kids forever.

286
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,970
- Yeah.
- But one day, you're not anymore.

287
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,906
And it's not that long, really.

288
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,931
That's really weird.

289
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,379
Do you want to grow up?

290
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,116
- Sometimes.
- I guess.

291
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,208
But I like this so much.

292
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,627
Come on, let's go across.

293
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,547
- Come on, it's not even that

294
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,782
deep over here. - I can't.

295
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:51,019
- Don't be a...
- I can't!

296
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:54,612
- Why?
- I just can't, okay?

297
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:57,114
Okay.

298
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,697
Besides, there's a monster
on the other side.

299
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,966
What? No, there's not.

300
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,869
Yeah there is. I heard it.
It's true.

301
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:11,873
It's a ghost, not a monster anyway, duh.
I heard it in school.

302
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:15,076
They told it wrong then.
It's definitely a monster.

303
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,146
- You're making it up.
- No, I'm not. I swear.

304
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,948
I heard that there's a monster that
lives really deep in the woods

305
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,784
on the other side of the creek.

306
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,853
It's really old and it waits
for kids to come out at night.

307
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:29,279
- That's stupid. There's no...
- I don't want to go across.

308
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,750
Okay.

309
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:53,347
I had this weird
dream last night.

310
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,850
What was it?

311
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,252
A little bit like some of
the other dreams that I had

312
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:01,389
after my mom and dad...

313
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,392
You don't have to talk about
it if you don't want.

314
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:08,496
It's okay. This one was
different from the others.

315
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,198
Why?

316
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:13,034
I was in the woods,
but not this part.

317
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,403
Somewhere else.

318
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:20,775
It was creepy. I heard this...
voice.

319
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,844
Do you remember what
the voice said?

320
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,968
Yeah. It said my name.

321
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,317
Don't go across
the creek, Peter.

322
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:32,920
- Why?
- Just don't, okay? Promise.

323
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:36,780
Okay, okay, I promise. Why
are you so weird about this?

324
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,753
Some things don't go away
when you stop pretending.

325
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,208
My pumpkin.

326
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,899
- Mom, mom, I have to tell you.
- Hi, honey, not now.

327
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:59,600
But, mom, the
neighbors are gone.

328
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,469
Well, maybe they
went out somewhere.

329
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:03,905
- All of them?
- Honey, do I know?

330
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,439
- I... - look, can you
tell me about this later?

331
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,341
I have a million things
to do right now.

332
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,677
I realized the heat
was due this month,

333
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,329
- and somehow I've got
to figure out how

334
00:31:11,341 --> 00:31:12,980
we're gonna... - there's
something wrong.

335
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,916
You bet there's something wrong.

336
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,285
It takes a lot to keep this
little ship afloat, bub.

337
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:20,221
- But...
- I said not now!

338
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:25,192
There's food and dinner and
stuff on their tables.

339
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,094
Well, maybe they went
out for something.

340
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:29,130
How do you know there's
food on the table?

341
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:30,398
Were you looking in their house?

342
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,500
- But...
- Were you?

343
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,503
- Just listen for a second.
- Why would you do something like this?

344
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:38,272
We just moved here. We're
trying to settle in.

345
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,540
We're trying to
make a new start,

346
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,208
and you're spying
on the neighbors?

347
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,944
Peter, you know how
hard this has been.

348
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,445
Why would you try
and make it harder?

349
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,080
I'm not trying to
make it harder.

350
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:49,550
Would you please listen
and stop being so stupid?

351
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,186
That's it, up to bed.

352
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,256
Now.

353
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,980
Vamonos.

354
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,469
Hey, Peter. Come in here.

355
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,858
Peter! Peter!

356
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:48,295
Peter? Peter? What's wrong?

357
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,798
Oh, oh. It was just a dream.

358
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:55,703
It was just a dream, okay?
Are you okay?

359
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,727
I heard you again.

360
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,878
I'm sorry I got so
angry earlier, babe.

361
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:08,182
Oh, no, no, no, no. Please, don't cry.
Don't cry.

362
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,352
It's okay. God. Oh,
it's a mess, isn't it?

363
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,554
I'm a mess, and...
And you're a mess.

364
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:18,448
But... but we're okay, right?
The two of us, we're okay.

365
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:55,462
I'm telling you,
something is wrong.

366
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,498
You were dreaming. You
always sleepwalk.

367
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,366
You really freaked me out the
first time you stayed over.

368
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,870
I swear I wasn't sleeping.

369
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,472
Ah, so you're trying to tell me

370
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,374
that the basement talked to you

371
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:10,311
and then a monster tried
to break in your house.

372
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,679
Well, yeah.

373
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:15,549
Did your mom see the monster?

374
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,719
The monster was gone
before my mom got there.

375
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,521
Ah-ha.

376
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:22,356
Well, what about all
the missing people?

377
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,558
- What missing people?
- My neighbors.

378
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,760
Your neighbors aren't missing.

379
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,629
Well, something's going on.

380
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:32,399
You're right. You've got
a crazy imagination.

381
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:36,403
Remember the time when you tried to make
me believe that my toys came to life

382
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:39,740
and you only ended up scaring yourself
and locking all your toys in the closet?

383
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,409
This is totally different.
I'm not making this up.

384
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,578
Maggie said there was something
weird about this place.

385
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:47,481
There is something weird
about this place... you.

386
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:51,318
Maggie said there was a monster or
something that lived in the woods.

387
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,620
Not a ghost, by the way.

388
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,588
That's not what I heard.

389
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,957
Well, Maggie knows
more than you.

390
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,360
And you are scared of
your toys coming to life.

391
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,429
- Hey!
- Well, the point is

392
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:06,367
that I used to believe
that, well...

393
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,736
Well, you shouldn't believe,
'cause it's not real.

394
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,531
There's no such thing as monsters,
ghosts, bigfoots, or any of that stuff.

395
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,746
There might be aliens.
We just don't know.

396
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,615
- Bill, I'm trying to tell you...
- Okay, um, sorry. I gotta go.

397
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:25,753
Uh, you go home and get some rest or...
Something.

398
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,921
Uh, see you tomorrow.

399
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,491
Well, just remember
to be careful.

400
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:34,028
You do you know that this is how
my crazy uncle Bruce sounded

401
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:35,696
before they took
him to the home,

402
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,856
but my mom pretended
he moved to Florida?

403
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,076
Peter.

404
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,760
Peter!

405
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,763
Maggie? What's going on?

406
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,865
- We've got to go.
- What? Where am I?

407
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:28,724
Come on, you're in danger.
We've got to go!

408
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:35,064
It's here.

409
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:41,395
It's okay. I don't
hear anything.

410
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:43,397
I think we're safe now.

411
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:45,432
Come on, we can head
back to my house.

412
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,968
Back that way?

413
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,904
No. We can cross the
creek and follow it

414
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,306
on the other side to the road.

415
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,964
Come on.

416
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:09,746
What's wrong, really?

417
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,430
I lied before.

418
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:19,399
What?

419
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,401
There is a ghost.

420
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,204
What do you mean?

421
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,229
She died here.

422
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,277
No.

423
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:32,045
No, you're a kid.

424
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,880
I used to be.

425
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:37,350
- Stop lying!
- I'm not lying. I'm not.

426
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,052
You have to be because
that's crazy.

427
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,888
Why do you think no one
has ever seen me before?

428
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,291
Why do you think
I'm always here?

429
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:45,782
No.

430
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:50,119
No. I don't believe you.

431
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,968
Look at me.

432
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,325
Really look.

433
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:00,430
Believing is seeing.

434
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,189
How can you be dead?

435
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:52,259
Because no one came to help,

436
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:54,828
and the water was too strong.

437
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,519
And I couldn't keep it out.

438
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,460
Please don't be afraid of me.

439
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,400
So that's why you can't cross.

440
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:23,890
We can stay on this side if we
cut through the playground.

441
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,414
Come on.

442
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:33,600
What's it like?

443
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,827
It's... lonely.

444
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:54,588
After they found me,

445
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:58,181
my mom came to the creek
one time to visit.

446
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,062
She was crying.

447
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:21,181
I wanted to tell her
I was right here,

448
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,949
but I couldn't.

449
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,074
Grownups can't see.

450
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:32,025
Later, my mom and
dad moved away,

451
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,950
but I couldn't go with them.

452
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,522
When I was little,

453
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:06,983
my dad made up these
great bedtime stories.

454
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:13,199
He used all these great voices.

455
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,425
But I didn't know
dads could be liars.

456
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:23,476
I don't know what
I'd do if he died.

457
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,002
You must miss them a lot.

458
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,384
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

459
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,154
I thought maybe...

460
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:35,422
You'd leave me.

461
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:38,058
Never. We're best friends.

462
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,582
Right?

463
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,702
Do you like to know
how it happened?

464
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:50,927
It's a scary story.

465
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:55,742
There really is a monster.

466
00:48:55,766 --> 00:49:00,046
My sister told me to scare
me, but she was right.

467
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,614
I saw it.

468
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:04,184
It takes kids away.

469
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:08,722
It tried to get me, but there
was a storm, and I got lost.

470
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:11,691
It wants you next.
It's calling you.

471
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:15,195
And I don't think it's gonna
stop until it gets you.

472
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:17,430
Why me?

473
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,733
Because you're the kid
who finally came.

474
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:23,370
Haven't you noticed there aren't
any other kids around here?

475
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,138
Yeah, I guess.

476
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,707
Bill said the last time
kids lived around here

477
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,410
was when his mom was little.

478
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,213
People don't know
the real reason,

479
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:36,205
but they learn. This
is not a good place.

480
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:41,254
Maybe that's why all the
grownups are leaving.

481
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:44,624
That's what grownups
do sometimes.

482
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,393
I think this is different.

483
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:49,763
I think the monster
is taking them away.

484
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:52,432
We've got to do something.

485
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:55,368
What?

486
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,737
My mom and I are used to moving.

487
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,407
You can come with.

488
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:03,243
Your mom won't believe you.
You know she won't.

489
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:06,546
And... I can't leave.

490
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:10,083
Oh, I'm sorry.

491
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:12,118
What are we supposed to do then?

492
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,754
I don't know.

493
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,779
- Peter?
- Bill?

494
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,829
What are you doing here?

495
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,498
Oh, you know, just going for a
run in the middle of the night

496
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,400
because my toys are
trying to kill me.

497
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,370
- What?
- All right, you win.

498
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,772
I just had to crawl out
of my bathroom window

499
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,741
because a doll was trying
to break down the door.

500
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:38,144
All right, calm down. Calm
down, you're safe now.

501
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,447
Safe? Somehow, I don't think so.

502
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:42,449
Anyway, what are you doing here?

503
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:46,086
Escaping from the monster.
That's real, too, by the way.

504
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,611
Great. "Calm down," he says.

505
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,792
- Ahem.
- Uh, bill, this is Maggie.

506
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,295
Hi, Maggie, I'm bill. Not Billy.

507
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:57,330
Hi. Why not Billy?

508
00:50:57,354 --> 00:51:00,533
'Cause then the people take me
more seriously if I'm bill.

509
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,669
There are plenty of bills
that people respect.

510
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:06,372
Bill Clinton, bill
nye, the science guy.

511
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,274
- Does it work?
- Not really.

512
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:09,776
My mom just calls
me the unpaid bill.

513
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,644
Look, I hate to be rude,

514
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,546
but what the heck are we
supposed to do about this?

515
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,705
Would you be quite for a second?
I'm trying to think.

516
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:25,391
This would all go away if the
monster goes away, right?

517
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,595
- How does she know?
- She just knows, okay?

518
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,619
But that's right, right?

519
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,670
We've gotta fight it, don't we?

520
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,572
What? Are you crazy?

521
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,508
Maybe.

522
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:43,243
But I think we have to.

523
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,178
We're a bunch of stupid kids.

524
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,747
Bill, it's after me, and
it's not gonna stop.

525
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,782
None of us are safe now.

526
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,751
What?

527
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,720
It tried to get you, too.

528
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:55,355
Did you try and get him to help?

529
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:57,490
- Yeah.
- That's why.

530
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:59,192
It doesn't want
you to have help,

531
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:00,627
and it's just going
to get worse.

532
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:03,730
- Great.
- She's right. You're right.

533
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:07,800
Grownups won't ever believe
until it's too late.

534
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:11,571
It's up to us. Are you
going to help or not?

535
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:16,476
Fine. But if I die, I'm
going to be so mad at you.

536
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,378
Okay, tomorrow
night's Halloween.

537
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:20,313
That's when we'll do it.

538
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,482
Our parents will think we're
going out trick or treating,

539
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:23,783
so wear your costume.

540
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,586
We'll meet at my house. Come on.

541
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,288
This was all gonna be so good.

542
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:33,626
Get a ton of candy, scare
the pants off of Peter...

543
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,496
I hate to tell you this,
but if we fight it,

544
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,666
I think it will know,
and it will be angry.

545
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:43,225
I picked the wrong people to
trick or treat with this year.

546
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,919
Do you... sleep?

547
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:15,468
Don't worry about it.

548
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,493
I'll see you tomorrow.

549
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:47,033
So the monster might
still be out there,

550
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,036
because Victor Frankenstein
never finds him.

551
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,006
But he wasn't really
a monster, was he?

552
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,608
He had turned into a monster

553
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:59,312
from loss and fear

554
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:03,383
and loneliness and anger.

555
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,385
That's the sad part.

556
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:08,321
Had someone actually
taken the time

557
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:10,990
to get to know the
person inside,

558
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,774
maybe things would have
turned out different.

559
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:16,329
Okay, class, that's
it for today.

560
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:18,398
Remember your math
homework for tomorrow.

561
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,500
And, hey, I know
tonight's Halloween,

562
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:22,735
I know we're all
excited, but remember,

563
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,760
be safe out there.

564
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,616
- Are you ready for this?
- No.

565
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,319
- Are you?
- No.

566
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:41,954
We've gotta do something.

567
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:44,857
Just look around.

568
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:49,362
This is Halloween. There
should be people everywhere.

569
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:50,763
This has gotta stop

570
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,955
before everybody's gone.

571
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,805
Remember, meet at
my house at eight.

572
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:00,707
And bring your costume.

573
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:03,843
Don't tell anyone.

574
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:07,080
Even if they did believe us,
they'd just try and stop us.

575
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:09,716
Maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

576
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,751
Promise?

577
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,776
All right, all right.

578
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,860
See you later.

579
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,885
Here goes nothing.

580
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,875
Mom, what time is it?

581
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:19,145
It's a quarter till eight. Are you excited?
It's finally here.

582
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,881
- Yeah.
- Well, you could have fooled me.

583
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,884
- No, I am.
- Honey, what's wrong?

584
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:29,489
- Nothing.
- That's an awful big nothing.

585
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:32,258
It's just this year...

586
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,026
Don't open the door.

587
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:37,196
- Huh?
- Just leave the bowl of candy outside.

588
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,965
Well, I thought you
said that was lame.

589
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:40,633
I thought there were rules.

590
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:43,870
I know. This year's different.

591
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:46,506
Besides, you've been stressed.
You should relax.

592
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:49,242
Are you sure there's
nothing wrong?

593
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:51,277
I'd just rather you
stayed in tonight.

594
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,979
Peter?

595
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:56,148
Anyway, I have to put on
my Halloween costume.

596
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,851
Okay. Do I finally
get to see it?

597
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,876
Yes.

598
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:37,913
Mom?

599
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:42,584
Mom, do we have any flashlights?

600
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:47,289
Mom?

601
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:14,226
Whoa, nice costume.

602
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,861
She's gone.

603
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:20,289
- What?
- It took my mom. She's gone.

604
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,663
Come on. We have to save her.

605
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:43,255
Well, guys...

606
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:45,024
Here we go.

607
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:48,260
Nice costume, Pete, though
I could have guessed.

608
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:49,829
I almost brought pillowcases,

609
00:59:49,853 --> 00:59:52,398
but I guess we don't
need 'em now.

610
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,624
No.

611
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,339
Are you sure about this?

612
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:02,975
It took my mom.

613
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,677
I bet if you went to your house,

614
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:07,002
your parents would be gone, too.

615
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:11,083
Okay.

616
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:14,420
Hey, I thought you
were going as a cat.

617
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:18,024
It annoyed my neighbors.

618
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:19,892
Skeletons are good, too.

619
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:21,961
Cat was better.

620
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,295
Hey, where's your costume?

621
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:26,365
Oh, believe me,
she's wearing it.

622
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:29,291
- Huh?
- Well, guys.

623
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:39,178
That's my pumpkin.

624
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:42,448
Did you carve it like that?

625
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,718
No. It disappeared a while ago.

626
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:48,243
I told you it'd be mad.

627
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,840
Run!

628
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:42,698
Look.

629
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:50,372
I wonder if there's
anybody left at all.

630
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:18,399
I don't those kids are
from our neighborhood.

631
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:32,947
- I think we should go.
- Yeah.

632
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:44,526
Go!

633
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:51,800
Don't look behind you!

634
01:03:04,047 --> 01:03:08,016
I said don't look!

635
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

636
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,399
Come on!

637
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:44,056
Thanks.

638
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,525
Now I see why you like
Halloween so much.

639
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:51,063
- This is great.
- It's not normally like this.

640
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:52,520
Come on, guys. We gotta go.

641
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,162
This way!

642
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:23,952
- I think we lost them.
- Not for long.

643
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:45,340
Where's bill?

644
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:52,024
What are you doing?

645
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:54,093
- Go, Peter.
- Come on.

646
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,462
- No.
- What?

647
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:58,697
Get to those trees. Go, hide.

648
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:01,200
- Bill!
- You and Maggie gotta stop this.

649
01:06:01,224 --> 01:06:03,235
If you can't, no one can.

650
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:06,372
Someone's gonna have to stop these
things from being on your tail.

651
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:08,630
Those things will kill you.

652
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:14,435
- I run fast.
- No, you don't.

653
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:19,574
Just go. Get to those trees.
Hide, doofus.

654
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:33,054
Here goes nothing.

655
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:50,616
Hey, creepy kid demon!
Over here.

656
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,820
You make me want to throw up...
On your face.

657
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,479
That was a good one.

658
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,185
Gentlemen...

659
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:08,790
Start your engines.

660
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:38,630
What is all this?

661
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,655
I don't know.

662
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:49,641
These are bill's dad's glasses.

663
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:51,844
He borrowed them once.

664
01:07:51,868 --> 01:07:54,335
They made everything look funny.

665
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,642
And those are his mom's shoes.

666
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:12,454
That's my mom's.

667
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:17,258
We have to figure something out.

668
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:23,742
I don't know.

669
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:28,480
Okay, so why does
it even want us?

670
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,182
'Cause we scare easily.

671
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:33,152
- What?
- Think about it.

672
01:08:33,176 --> 01:08:35,854
All this is meant to scare us.

673
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:38,590
No one believes like kids.

674
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,893
I wish your sister told
us how to kill it.

675
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:43,351
She didn't know it was real.

676
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:11,913
Peter!

677
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:35,737
I know this place.

678
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,318
This is where I was in my dream.

679
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:41,753
I know this, too. This is it.

680
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:44,579
This is where it lives.

681
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:48,816
Stay together.

682
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:18,747
Peter?

683
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:20,882
Peter?

684
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:25,587
Peter?

685
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:34,689
You can't hurt the
people I love anymore!

686
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:40,688
I... I lost you.

687
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:45,660
Maggie?

688
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:53,835
What's going on? Come on.

689
01:12:55,638 --> 01:12:59,751
It looks like in my dream.
Exactly like.

690
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:01,787
It's meant to scare us.

691
01:13:01,811 --> 01:13:05,690
What are you talking about?

692
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:08,449
- There is no monster.
- What?

693
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:13,432
- Stay away, Peter.
- What are you doing?

694
01:13:13,456 --> 01:13:15,901
It's me. It's coming from me.

695
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:18,170
Maggie, what?

696
01:13:18,194 --> 01:13:21,006
It's from my bad dreams.
They're coming true.

697
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:23,508
You're not making sense.

698
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:28,547
Think about it. Bill said it
started when his mom was little.

699
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:31,116
When I was little.

700
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:32,784
It started when I died.

701
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:34,119
Bill doesn't know anything.

702
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:38,089
Maybe when something
bad enough happens,

703
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:39,991
it can change things.

704
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:41,927
Stop it. You're not doing this.

705
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:46,587
Believing is seeing. I
think it's real, so it is.

706
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:51,025
Just stay away from me
before you get hurt, too.

707
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:58,900
Watch out!

708
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:16,595
I was wrong.

709
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,697
You should be scared of me.

710
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:22,033
No, you're just a kid.
It can't be from you.

711
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:23,502
I mean, how?

712
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:26,271
I don't know, but it's true.

713
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,040
Besides, it doesn't
look like a monster.

714
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:33,979
It looks like kids, like,
trick-or-treating.

715
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:37,749
It's a monster. It has to be.

716
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:40,151
I'm not afraid of
trick-or-treaters.

717
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:43,688
No, but I am.

718
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:47,859
Last Halloween, I was chased
by older kids in masks.

719
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:50,028
They scared me really bad,

720
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,698
and bill was always scared
of toys coming to life.

721
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:57,068
I'm not scared of that, either.

722
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:59,604
- That's it.
- What's it?

723
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:02,774
- It's all of us.
- What?

724
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:04,643
It must have started with you,

725
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,678
but now it's spreading
to all of us.

726
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:11,049
Spreading? What do
you mean, spreading?

727
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:12,918
Like a germ or something.

728
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:17,088
Maggie, believing is seeing.
You said it.

729
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:19,791
No one believes like kids,

730
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:22,160
so no one gets scared like them.

731
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,796
Don't you see? It's not you.

732
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,165
It's the fear.

733
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:30,057
It's alive.

734
01:15:31,794 --> 01:15:33,728
We're all feeding it.

735
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:38,977
We've still gotta stop it.

736
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:41,780
I don't know how.

737
01:15:41,804 --> 01:15:45,350
It's taking over the whole town.

738
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:49,187
But... it's fear.

739
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,279
How do you stop that?

740
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:58,953
What scares you most?

741
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,593
Come on.

742
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:13,645
That's why all the grown-ups
are disappearing, isn't it?

743
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:15,570
You're scared of that, too.

744
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:25,112
I don't like this.

745
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:32,687
- Ready?
- Okay.

746
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:35,890
Go!

747
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:10,725
We've got to cross.

748
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:14,695
I don't think I can.

749
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:31,212
- Don't let go.
- I won't.

750
01:18:44,987 --> 01:18:46,898
I remember...

751
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:49,868
I was mad at my mom, because
she wouldn't let me stay over

752
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:55,029
at a friend's house, so I
snuck out and got lost.

753
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:08,987
I think we won.

754
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:11,156
I forgot it could be pretty.

755
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:14,259
It's a great spot.

756
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:16,427
I didn't mean to scare you.

757
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:19,030
I know.

758
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:23,468
So this is where you
played before...

759
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:24,925
Yeah.

760
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:30,765
Well, do you want
to play with me?

761
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,536
Hey, come on.

762
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,972
It's over now.

763
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:35,229
I know, we did it.

764
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:40,334
I think I have to go home.

765
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:46,918
No. You can't go. Together
forever, remember?

766
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:49,654
I can't stay. It had
to end sometime.

767
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,146
- No.
- You know that.

768
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:57,996
It's not fair. I want
it to be forever.

769
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,431
Every kid does.

770
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:03,368
Maybe it should be.

771
01:21:03,392 --> 01:21:05,459
Then you'd just be like me.

772
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:14,045
When I was with you,
I wasn't a ghost.

773
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:16,170
I was just... Maggie.

774
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,374
I'm really glad I finally
found you, Peter.

775
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:24,455
You were my best friend ever.

776
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,624
I'm going to miss you so much.

777
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:29,016
I'm going to miss you, too.

778
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:42,296
Your turn to be free.

779
01:21:43,532 --> 01:21:45,366
See you later, Pete.

780
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:49,570
Just wait.

781
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:16,501
Peter, what's wrong?
What's going on?

782
01:23:16,525 --> 01:23:18,803
It's good to see you, mom.

783
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:21,439
Yeah. I, uh...

784
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:23,441
I think we all came
out to see the sun

785
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:27,045
come up or something. I
don't really remember.

786
01:23:27,069 --> 01:23:30,448
It's okay. It's over.

787
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:33,117
Oh? Is that why you're crying?

788
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:36,087
Oh, I know that Halloween's
over, but, hey,

789
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:38,823
did you know that today
is all Saint's day?

790
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,458
What's that?

791
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:43,761
It's the day that you
honor the dead, honey.

792
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:45,296
Honor the dead?

793
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,465
That's right.

794
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:53,237
I think I feel good about that.

795
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:54,705
That's what she deserves.

796
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:58,109
Who? What's gotten into you?

797
01:23:58,133 --> 01:24:01,379
Just... the season.

798
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:04,138
- Let's go home, mom.
- Okay.

799
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:47,492
Well, now everything's
back to normal.

800
01:24:47,516 --> 01:24:49,560
Yeah.

801
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:52,130
My mom didn't remember anything,

802
01:24:52,154 --> 01:24:53,698
even when they woke
up in the field.

803
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:55,900
I guess they just forgot.

804
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:57,802
My mom, too. I guess grown-ups

805
01:24:57,826 --> 01:24:59,670
just wanna see what
they wanna see.

806
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:01,639
Yeah. It's weird.

807
01:25:01,663 --> 01:25:03,564
So where's Maggie?

808
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:07,812
- She moved away.
- What? When?

809
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:10,181
Is she gonna come
back and visit?

810
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:13,173
- I don't think so.
- This is stupid!

811
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,557
What was with her? Really.

812
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:22,927
Come on, I'm not that dumb.

813
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:26,564
All this? A monster?
Something was weird.

814
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:31,191
- She was the best ever.
- Okay, okay.

815
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:34,939
Look, I'll talk to you later.

816
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:37,308
Hey, where are you going?

817
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:40,545
There's just something
I have to do.

818
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:43,337
Thanks again, for everything.

819
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,773
No big deal.

820
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:54,325
All right, all right.
Don't get crazy again.

821
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:56,650
- I won't.
- See you.

822
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:38,225
I'm glad you're happy now.

823
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:40,938
Who are you talking to?

824
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:41,962
What?

825
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:49,247
- Uh, no one.
- Uh-huh.

826
01:26:49,271 --> 01:26:51,538
Don't get too close
to the water.

827
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:54,652
What did you say?

828
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:56,887
I said don't get too
close to the water.

829
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:59,890
You might fall in.

830
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:01,915
Because piranhas?

831
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:06,797
I think piranhas only
are in the Amazon.

832
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:08,399
I'm Lilly, by the way.

833
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:10,968
Hi, Lilly. I'm Peter.

834
01:27:10,992 --> 01:27:13,971
Nice to meet you.
We just moved here.

835
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:18,009
Well, my mom lived here, but she
moved away when she was little.

836
01:27:18,033 --> 01:27:21,969
There was an accident where her
sister died a long time ago.

837
01:27:23,872 --> 01:27:28,653
It's weird. I feel like
I've been here before.

838
01:27:28,677 --> 01:27:31,956
Anyway, wanna play?

839
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,891
Yeah, I think I would.

840
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:36,961
Great! Can you help me
look for some snails?

841
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:39,630
I would pick them up, but they're
totally gross and slimy,

842
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:42,256
