1
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,460
And some hamachi. Two pieces.

2
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,133
What is a “holiday roll"?

3
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,761
Okay.

4
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,596
Thank you.

5
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,644
I'm late, I know. Sorry.

6
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,355
They kept me at work an extra hour.

7
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,606
Are you okay?

8
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,691
Okay.

9
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,317
What's that?

10
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,861
I fell off my bike.

11
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,863
- That thing? -Yeah.

12
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,240
Looks like you never rode it.

13
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,450
And you see why?

14
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,872
You've carefully avoided saying what this job is.

15
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,916
I told you, it's entry level.

16
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,003
But there's a fast track to promotion.

17
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,171
Kind of manager.

18
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,839
Kind of McDonald's?

19
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,132
Yeah.

20
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,927
I brought you a present.

21
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,555
It's from Josie, really.

22
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,682
It was her idea.

23
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,560
You look very handsome.

24
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,607
We'll go back and take another photo after the birth.

25
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,358
Like a before and after.

26
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,987
Josie's full of ideas for decorating.

27
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,281
She never had her own place till now.

28
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,242
How much do you need for the apartment?

29
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:47,662
I didn't ask for money.

30
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,748
No, it was me, hearing voices.

31
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,418
I planned to ask you to provide collateral, not money.

32
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,214
And Josie's boyfriends?

33
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,050
Any of them moving in, too?

34
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,676
No, why...

35
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,471
Shit! It was just cleaned.

36
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,395
That girl is clearly dysfunctional.

37
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,980
You know nothing about her.

38
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,443
Except she was raised in a commune by unwashed idiots.

39
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,820
An arts collective.

40
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,405
Why you? What's she after?

41
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,033
What could she be after? I have no money.

42
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,035
I have.

43
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,703
What's with you today?

44
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,923
I'll give you 3 months' rent. But I look at the place first.

45
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,925
I didn't want to pressure you.

46
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,261
You won. Quit while you're ahead.

47
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,356
<i>_ </i> -Bye.

48
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,630
Change all the locks, upstairs and down.

49
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,173
Okay.

50
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,926
I left the key in the mailbox.

51
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,677
Thanks a lot.

52
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,846
You've seen Vincent's apartment?

53
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,682
6 months ago, he was dealing weed and getting into fights.

54
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,184
You see him as a family man?

55
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,978
That bitch Josie is a real menace.

56
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,814
He just doesn't see it.

57
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,056
Kwan, we agreed

58
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,767
the orgasmic convulsions are way too timid.

59
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,644
As if they're scared of sex.

60
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,312
I upped it 5 times.

61
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,981
You can't tell. Push it.

62
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,857
Can we discuss the real issues?

63
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,778
We get one shot at Activision,

64
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,905
but our controller is so crappy

65
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,866
the demo is almost unplayable.

66
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:17,122
What's the point coming up with hyper
realistic environments for Stix

67
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,000
if the player throws the controller through the screen!

68
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,420
Kurt, you're off track, focusing on known glitches.

69
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,170
<i>No.</i>

70
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,881
The real problem is right there.

71
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,762
The real problem is, your background in publishing and literature

72
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,975
is completely inappropriate for evaluating playability.

73
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:46,359
Okay, maybe Anna and I should've founded
a different sort of company.

74
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,154
Maybe Kronos was only a hit

75
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,281
thanks to your genius ideas.

76
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,243
Maybe we're just two bitches who got lucky.

77
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,411
But the fact is,

78
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,039
the boss here is me.

79
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,666
And we're 6 months behind.

80
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,632
Our goal is simple, as you all know.

81
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,301
When the player guts an orc,

82
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,887
he needs to feel the blood on his hands.

83
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,680
Thick, warm blood.

84
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,182
If at all possible.

85
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,475
Let's go.

86
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,769
I love you.

87
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,860
Does Kurt hate me or is it just me?

88
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,945
No, he hates you.

89
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,364
They all hate you, except Kevin.

90
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,451
He really loves you. even if he tries to laugh it off.

91
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,497
And you knew it, right?

92
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,216
Press here.

93
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,384
She knows I want a full STD panel?

94
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,636
Yes, of course.

95
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,972
If you're worried about a recent exposure,

96
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,682
I can prescribe a PEP.

97
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,019
No, I looked online. Too many side effects.

98
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,688
I can't miss any work.

99
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,483
I guess we roll the dice.

100
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:31,965
Hello?

101
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,384
My evening just cleared up.

102
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,595
- I can't. -Make an effort.

103
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,056
I can't. I have...

104
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,893
I have my period. I'm not well.

105
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,187
I'll wear a condom.

106
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,065
I appreciate your sense of sacrifice.

107
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,359
A little blood doesn't turn me off.

108
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,652
No, I can't.

109
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:53,903
See you.

110
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:04,372
Scum!

111
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,033
You and your father.

112
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,701
I love everything you do to me.

113
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,163
Let's do it again.

114
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,752
Next time, ring the bell.

115
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,630
If you want to avoid being treated to upsetting sights,

116
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,842
Then you won't be treated to gruesome sights.

117
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,053
I'd better put some pants on.

118
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,932
How much do you pay them?

119
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,434
-It's pitiful! -Save your pity.

120
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,936
I'm not ashamed.

121
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,063
It's my life. My sex life.

122
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,689
You're a little bitch, Michéle.

123
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,484
I'm just saying, with your finances. be careful.

124
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,277
Did you eat? I made spaghetti.

125
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,737
I'll take a coffee.

126
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,906
- Not taking your coat off? -I'm cold.

127
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,994
You had more work done?

128
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,788
Will you stop going on about that?

129
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,624
I'm sorry.

130
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,751
Just a little Botox.

131
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,419
It's your business.

132
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:37,590
Very good.

133
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,967
You seem surprised.

134
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,468
Better like this?

135
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,805
Michéle, some other time, I have to take off.

136
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,390
No. not yet.

137
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,314
My mother told you she's HIV-positive?

138
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,900
I warned Ralf you'd try that one.

139
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,694
Nice meeting you.

140
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,159
One question. Think before you answer.

141
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,620
What would you say if I remarried?

142
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,330
It's simple, I'd kill you.

143
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,873
No need to think.

144
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,251
You always wanted a sanitized version of life.

145
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,878
You asked, I answered.

146
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,213
I'd kill you.

147
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,258
You're so selfish, it's frightening.

148
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,759
I know.

149
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,556
By the way, here's your check.

150
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,935
You never give anything truly of yourself.

151
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,315
- Your father, it's such an ordeal? -Don't.

152
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,442
- He's old. -Still breathing.

153
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,027
Some bonds never break.

154
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,279
I walk in and it's one horror after another.

155
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,989
He has a parole hearing.

156
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,325
That's enough. Okay?

157
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,748
Your stud forgot his hernia belt.

158
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,090
- You need a hand? -No, I've got it.

159
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,886
Is it big enough?

160
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,972
Any taller and the star will scrape the ceiling.

161
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,226
Michéle!

162
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:13,603
Evening.

163
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,230
I'm so glad I caught you. Here...

164
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,107
I'm handing these out.

165
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,110
It's about the Board's trash separation policy.

166
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,028
Thank you.

167
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,073
The fines for non-compliance are exorbitant.

168
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,367
We're meeting Wednesday to oppose it.

169
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,535
You're on the Board, aren't you?

170
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,829
- Yes. -I've tried to point out

171
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,998
that minor conflict of interest.

172
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,334
It's an interesting position.

173
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,252
Yes, that's right. Exactly.

174
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,588
I hope you can make it.

175
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,756
Perhaps.

176
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,216
- Goodnight. -Goodnight.

177
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,886
I'll just deliver these.

178
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,138
Be right back!

179
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,780
- Good evening. -Good evening.

180
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,450
Last one. Your new keys are on the table.

181
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,701
Thank you.

182
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,622
Did you notice the back doorjams?

183
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,167
I only do locks.

184
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,211
How come?

185
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,171
Okay.

186
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,076
How'd you get out there?

187
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Come on in.

188
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,598
You didn't have to claw his eyes out but scratch him at least.

189
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,517
I'm just saying.

190
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,661
I found you very narrow, for a woman of your age

191
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,753
That one's 25.

192
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,926
That's the Safety Angel.

193
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,970
- The most powerful? -Serious stuff.

194
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,764
0.2 oz of pepper spray at 110 mph.

195
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,724
Gives you quite an advantage.

196
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,351
I'll take it.

197
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,946
And this.

198
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:32,778
Hey, you!

199
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,198
You told Vincent you'd pay his rent?

200
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,534
No, I said I'd help out for a while.

201
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,703
Mr. Casamayou, your table's ready.

202
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,665
Don't expect me to pitch in. I'm stone broke.

203
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,375
I'm the one who made the promise.

204
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,127
Why?

205
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,671
Struggling to get by builds character.

206
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,298
Trouble is, he's dating a psycho.

207
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,799
Thank you very much.

208
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,136
The wacko won't tolerate struggling.

209
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,596
Psycho's the word.

210
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,349
Often though, that kind of girl's good in bed.

211
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,726
What does that even mean, " good in bed" ?

212
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,104
- I never knew. -You read my proposal?

213
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:14,403
Richard, would you say I'm tight for a woman my age?

214
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,947
Hi there!

215
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,159
- Hi. -Thanks.

216
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,702
What's up, loser?

217
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,953
How are you, pumpkin?

218
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:27,041
Just in time to hear Michele avoid giving
her thoughts on my game idea.

219
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,542
No! It was very interesting.

220
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,127
You bet it's interesting.

221
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,046
Tell all.

222
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,923
- Bubbly, 4 glasses. -No. a bottle!

223
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,677
It's set in a time when dogs have been wiped out by a virus.

224
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,638
So people have robotic canines as pets.

225
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,182
The player's the Spartacus of the robot-dog world.

226
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,476
Original.

227
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,565
Interesting.

228
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,901
I have something to tell you all.

229
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,908
I was looking for a way of simply and naturally

230
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,412
tossing this out. but I can't find one.

231
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,914
So...

232
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,792
Here goes. I was assaulted

233
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,335
at home.

234
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,047
I guess I was raped.

235
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,342
Raped?

236
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,470
- Oh my god. -For real?

237
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,514
When?

238
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,142
Thursday, at 3pm.

239
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,685
And you never said?

240
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,272
I don't know what to say. What can I say?

241
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,107
Oh my god!

242
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,736
- I feel stupid for bringing it up. -Are you insane?

243
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,530
A Piper-Heidsieck.

244
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:40,906
Very good.

245
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,660
Wait a few minutes before popping it.

246
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,540
Are you alright?

247
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,375
You have to see a doctor.

248
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,793
Done that.

249
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,670
What did the cops say?

250
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,215
You didn't report it?

251
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,552
Michele, you have to report it immediately.

252
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,553
What for?

253
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,096
What for!

254
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,849
It's over. It doesn't need talking about anymore.

255
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,976
It's not worth a debate.

256
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,232
How about we order?

257
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,486
You avoid the police because...

258
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,781
Of course I avoid the police "because!"

259
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,450
I won't deal with the police ever again.

260
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,786
- See you! -See you!

261
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,289
<i>- I'll</i> get you a gun. -A gun! You're out of your mind.

262
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,041
Richard. I should tell you...

263
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,336
Your proposal, our investors aren't interested.

264
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,962
I don't want to discuss it now.

265
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,340
But I'd like your opinion on it.

266
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,384
It's got nothing to do with the quality of your work.

267
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:46,764
It's a business that's tied into a particular demographic.

268
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,141
A demographic oblivious to quality?

269
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,518
Exactly.

270
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,228
Come on, I can take it!

271
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,188
Be honest. What did you think of it?

272
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:57,650
Richard, go back to your novel. You're a writer.

273
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,485
Sure. A penniless writer.

274
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,531
Somebody trashed your fender.

275
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,659
Somebody?

276
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,412
See you.

277
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,384
Shit!

278
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,639
Here you go.

279
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,521
I'll be right there, I...

280
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,773
I'll just grab myjacket.

281
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,571
You got my sundae?

282
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,616
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

283
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,004
Here, for you.

284
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,089
- For me? -Yes, made it myself.

285
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,924
That's so sweet.

286
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,977
- Delicious. -Not bad, right?

287
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,024
Mrs. Leblanc? Hello.

288
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:20,566
Hello

289
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,818
I'm Philippe, from the agency.

290
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,195
Vincent, good timing, I need you here.

291
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,654
Hey, Michéle.

292
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,948
- What can I do? -Stand against the wall.

293
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,534
- Yeah? -Yeah.

294
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,369
With your arms...

295
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:36,624
The bookcase is 5 feet wide. I want to visualize it.

296
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,167
Like this, okay?

297
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,292
Vincent...

298
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,755
Don't act the bookcase. Be the bookcase.

299
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,216
Okay, hold this.

300
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,720
Vincent is quite the actor.

301
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:51,680
Are you hurt?

302
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,182
- No. -No, it's fine.

303
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,685
Age 12, he was young Achilles in Kronos.

304
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,562
A video game I produced.

305
00:23:58,646 --> 00:23:59,939
Yeah?

306
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,650
I bet you were the cutest knight in armor.

307
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,276
Not too shabby.

308
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,329
Nice, huh?

309
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,830
A little too nice, don't you think?

310
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,793
There's room for a 50-inch here.

311
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,211
Did you ask her?

312
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,673
You mentioned a microwave,

313
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:29,760
but we thought a TV makes a better housewarming present.

314
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,680
Don't you need an oven more than a TV?

315
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,724
We don't need one. The kitchen comes fully equipped.

316
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,727
Is this the apartment you told me about?

317
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,480
No, it's a 2-bedroom here.

318
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,857
$250 a month more.

319
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,403
The other one was a dump. Nowhere to put a crib.

320
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,779
Totally insane.

321
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,448
Dump, I don't think so.

322
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,451
Basic, maybe.

323
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,120
Dump, definitely not.

324
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,790
Basic, sure.

325
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,629
You realize having a child is all about suffering?

326
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,257
Vincent's birth was sheer hell.

327
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,675
Torture.

328
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,300
Three hours of agony.

329
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,303
If you don't want to help us, don't.

330
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:14,763
Nobody's forcing you.

331
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,932
How'll you get by if I don't?

332
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,768
That's our problem.

333
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,771
You can't talk to me like that and take my money.

334
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,065
I don't give a shit about your money.

335
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,650
I never asked for it.

336
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,488
You just stand there, saying nothing, as usual!

337
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,576
It's bullshit! When are you going to get off your ass?

338
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,540
Butt out, you!

339
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,959
You realize that this is impossible?

340
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,461
- What? -She's a lunatic.

341
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,755
She's not. she's my girlfriend.

342
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,257
You refuse to see I've changed.

343
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,261
What do you feel now?

344
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,013
Fear or anger?

345
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,514
Anger.

346
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,018
You've missed your wife. Anna's in Angouléme today.

347
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,106
And you knew it.

348
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,580
You know I went through a traumatic experience

349
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,040
recently.

350
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,628
You gave the impression of soldiering on like nothing happened.

351
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,507
If I seem insensitive, I'm sorry.

352
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,175
That's just me, right?

353
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,136
I see you're staying in character.

354
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,057
A big part of my character

355
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,696
is being unpredictable.

356
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,451
Hold on.

357
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,486
Say, have you experienced any incidents recently?

358
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,320
Incidents?

359
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,030
You know what I mean.

360
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,450
A man threw pizza at me from his car. He missed.

361
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,787
People were staring at me at the market.

362
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,538
But I always feel that.

363
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,291
I wonder if it isn't starting again.

364
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,210
A new cycle.

365
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:14,753
You don't know?

366
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,966
The Accused Will Rise about your father aired again last Saturday.

367
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,760
- Refreshes people's memories. -I'd no idea.

368
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,303
And you?

369
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,639
Anything happened?

370
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,224
No, nothing special.

371
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,061
It's because of his parole hearing.

372
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,771
A media feeding frenzy.

373
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,815
He's up before the judge next week.

374
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,608
You don't miss a beat.

375
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,652
Two coffees, please.

376
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,237
Come with me.

377
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,282
They'll never let him out. Thank god!

378
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,951
The parole hearing is a charade.

379
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,703
Like you telling me to come,

380
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,122
when you know I'd rather gouge my eyes out.

381
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,957
How long will you hang on to hatred?

382
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,377
I'll never see him again, in this world or any other.

383
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,212
- Anyway, there is no other. -Your coffee.

384
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,214
- There isn't much time left. -Thanks.

385
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,424
He's ill.

386
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,843
<i>Look...</i>

387
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,679
Look, just for one moment.

388
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,558
You're afraid to look at your own father?

389
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,401
Put it away now.

390
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,404
You're not like the mob.

391
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,823
People who only know the monster.

392
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,784
You know the man. He's just a man.

393
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,786
Who happens to be a monster.

394
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,788
You see a contradiction there?

395
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,584
Drink up. I'm done here.

396
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,086
Be careful, won't you?

397
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,089
Some people won'tjust toss crap

398
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
from their cars.

399
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

400
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,408
Marty!

401
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,038
Give me that bird.

402
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,082
Marty!

403
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,961
We don't treat wild birds. It's a sparrow?

404
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,462
Yes.

405
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,299
I wouldn't even know how to intubate your sparrow.

406
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,968
If it is a sparrow.

407
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,805
Thanks very much.

408
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:12,931
Goodbye.

409
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,474
You're welcome. Goodbye.

410
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,868
...victims of all ages.

411
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,372
Seen today, this quiet street in the suburbs of Nantes

412
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,084
bears no trace of the atrocities that took place here

413
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,586
39 years ago.

414
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,172
Few of today's inhabitants

415
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:46,798
know the name, Georges Leblanc.

416
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,842
Or if they do,

417
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:52,220
it's a name associated with a horror story

418
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,055
that they can hardly remember.

419
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,225
An urban folktale from another time.

420
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,936
And yet, in 1976,

421
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,148
the eyes of France were trained on this street.

422
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,609
A nation held its breath.

423
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,235
In shock.

424
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,237
Time has dulled the terror

425
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,406
of that distant day in May.

426
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,784
But for some the horror will never fade away.

427
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,412
Nor will the unanswered questions.

428
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,499
What drove Georges Leblanc,

429
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,083
a practising Catholic,

430
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,919
loving husband and father,

431
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,088
to commit such monstrous and senseless acts?

432
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:32,260
And what role exactly was played by his daughter, Michele?

433
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,096
A ten-year-old child at the time.

434
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,602
After years of trials and psychiatric evaluations,

435
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:44,688
over 3O years after Georges Leblanc's incarceration,

436
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,608
sentenced to life,

437
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:49,653
the questions remain,

438
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,321
as banal yet chilling as ever.

439
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,031
First and foremost...

440
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,448
Why?

441
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,951
Murderer!

442
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,760
I hope that's recyclable.

443
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,929
It's a dead bird.

444
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,229
Richard!

445
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,527
What were you thinking?

446
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,446
I was worried about you.

447
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,656
Jesus!

448
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,658
Don't rub your eyes.

449
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,579
You say you were raped and didn't report it,

450
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,956
obviously I'm going to...

451
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,210
Holy shit, you really did a number on me!

452
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,878
I'm sorry.

453
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,839
That helps? You know what you're doing?

454
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,050
It's on the pepper spray label.

455
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,510
Could be, I'll go blind.

456
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,387
Of course, you won't go blind!

457
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,555
There we go.

458
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,893
- Glass of wine? -Yes. please.

459
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,814
I didn't recognize the car. Whose is it?

460
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,273
A friend's.

461
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,817
A girl friend's?

462
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,070
- Her name's Héléne. -Héléne.

463
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,825
I borrowed hers. Mine's in the shop.

464
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,702
Somebody smashed the bumper.

465
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,371
It was barely visible.

466
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,919
She's a friend, Michéle.

467
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,713
Why am I even justifying this?

468
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,423
You have nothing tojustify.

469
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,301
- She's a student? -Grad student.

470
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,262
Surprise me.

471
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,932
She's not my student. She organizes a De Beauvoir seminar.

472
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,475
She invited me to speak.

473
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:08,893
And she's read your book.

474
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,061
She's read it.

475
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,522
And told me how deeply it touched her,

476
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,482
I melted inside.

477
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,068
That's all. You can imagine the rest.

478
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,279
I can imaginejust fine, actually.

479
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,698
Yourjealousy is insane.

480
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,700
No, I'm just concerned.

481
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,788
I'm concerned because this is what I feared.

482
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,000
The bimbos with big tits never worried me,

483
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,795
but a woman who's read The Second Sex will chew you up

484
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,672
and spit you out.

485
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,133
The real danger, Michéle, is you.

486
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,181
Did you know about her?

487
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,891
Yeah, I met her once.

488
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,476
When was that?

489
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,979
Last week. We all had dinner at Dad's.

490
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,148
Why didn't you mention it?

491
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,524
Idunnom

492
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,067
Josie, put that down. I'll do it.

493
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,652
When?

494
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,155
Can I have some focus here, please?

495
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,072
What?

496
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,949
What's Héléne like?

497
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,661
She's cool. A yoga teacher. Bikram yoga, I think.

498
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,163
Move your feet, will you?

499
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,414
Where?

500
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,166
- Why? -I told Eric he could have it.

501
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,835
Eric? Who's this Eric?

502
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,170
Marais Yoga Center.

503
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,923
- Can't it wait? -Move your feet!

504
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,010
How about you help me unpack?

505
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,470
I'll be right there.

506
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,597
The fight'll be over in 10 minutes.

507
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,516
And soccer next up.

508
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,565
Josie! Where are you going?

509
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,610
Vincent, I'll call you back.

510
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,028
Yeah.bye.

511
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,705
Seen it?

512
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,999
It was sent to the whole office?

513
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,167
Take a look.

514
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,350
This isn't the first thing he's sent me.

515
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,686
First thing who's sent you?

516
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,481
The guy who attacked you?

517
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:19,899
Of course.

518
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,819
You think that's possible? Your attacker?

519
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,280
I mean, the email seems to come from here.

520
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,532
Looks like it.

521
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,325
Call the police now.

522
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:32,120
The police, never again. It's pointless.

523
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,414
This is different. You're the victim.

524
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,374
I was the victim then!

525
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,458
Sorry, I...

526
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,211
I don't want the police involved.

527
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,839
I won't let this cretin stir up all that shit.

528
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:46,885
I fought too hard to rebuild my life, so police,journalists...

529
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,803
No way.

530
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,263
God help us.

531
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,848
There's a nutjob out there.

532
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,517
Nutjobs, I can handle. My specialty.

533
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,353
When our server was hacked in June,

534
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:05,069
somebody ripped the Cthulhu template off our mainframe.

535
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,655
Images like these have floated around since then.

536
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,450
My secret admirer

537
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,535
must be highly tech savvy.

538
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,664
- A former employee maybe? -Yeah.

539
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,796
Last question. You think she's pretty?

540
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,176
Bend forward, from low in your back.

541
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,179
Stretch your spine all the way to the floor.

542
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,972
Deep breath.

543
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:36,684
Push the floor with your left hand until seated again.

544
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,227
Thank you all very much.

545
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,980
Have a good day. Excellent work.

546
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:43,858
Namaste.

547
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,319
Héléne?

548
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:50,573
I'm Michéle. Richard's ex.

549
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,410
- Nice to meet you. -Hello.

550
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,955
Hope you don't mind me barging in.

551
00:40:57,038 --> 00:41:00,041
I wanted to apologize face to face.

552
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,209
For what?

553
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,503
Your car window. I'm sorry.

554
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:08,049
Please. it's nothing. Anyway, Richard explained it all.

555
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,052
Really? What was his explanation?

556
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,262
It was an accident.

557
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,016
Yes, that's right. An accident.

558
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,978
And a good chance to meet you.

559
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,269
Yes, great!

560
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,648
It's wonderful finally meeting you.

561
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,901
- I was thinking... -Richard won't have to introduce us.

562
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,070
We've dodged an awkward situation.

563
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,115
Why would it be awkward?

564
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,409
Well...

565
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,452
Of course, you're right, it's...

566
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,705
I guess we could have...

567
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,582
- I mean... -But it's behind us now.

568
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:42,625
Exactly!

569
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,548
We should get together some time, all of us.

570
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,050
Yes. I'm having a Christmas party.

571
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:53,428
You really must come.

572
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,138
Come along.

573
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,848
If I must.

574
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:00,268
I'll give Richard the details. I should get going.

575
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,228
Lovely to meet you.

576
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,355
Yes, lovely to have met you.

577
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,815
- Good bye. -Good bye.

578
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:18,578
Hello?

579
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,375
Port Royal, right now?

580
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,253
Really?

581
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,134
She was losing blood. They did an ultrasound.

582
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,678
- She has a... -A placental abruption.

583
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:38,181
They say it's okay but they're inducing labor.

584
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,016
- Oh -Omar, a buddy of mine.

585
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,309
- Hello. -Dad!

586
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,062
- What's the news? -Nothing yet.

587
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,482
- Hi. -Hi.

588
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,858
I'm right here.

589
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,861
- I'm scared. -it's gonna be okay.

590
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,073
It hurts!

591
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,699
I'll go get a coffee.

592
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,160
Deep breaths.

593
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,621
Fuck, it hurts!

594
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,874
So suddenly you're throwing a Christmas party?

595
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:08,711
I thought it'd be good to get to know each other better.

596
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,129
She's lovely, by the way.

597
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,422
Another of your traps?

598
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:15,676
I have better things to do than plot diabolical Christmas dinners.

599
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,305
Is there anything she won't eat? Any allergies?

600
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,808
The cat's shedding like crazy.

601
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,394
I made no fuss about your violinist.

602
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:26,813
That was different!

603
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:30,108
He was married with 3 kids. He checked every box.

604
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,111
She's a young, single woman of child-bearing age.

605
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,403
You've broken all the rules.

606
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,782
First I heard we had an agreement. It's not my fault if...

607
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:42,036
It is your fault. We should still be together.

608
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,123
-It's your fault. -You left me.

609
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,541
You hit me.

610
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,463
If there's one thing in my life I regret, it's that.

611
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:54,966
All done!

612
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:56,843
- All done? -Yes.

613
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,488
We're going to need a DNA test.

614
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,419
- Are they bringing him in? -Right now.

615
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:33,671
I'll be a good mother to him.

616
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,715
Silly! You'll be awesome!

617
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,067
Should we go?

618
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:57,612
<i>No.</i>

619
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,155
It's fine.

620
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,032
Lots of people here.

621
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,751
Hey, everybody!

622
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,965
Who's a proud Daddy!

623
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:26,432
A little marvel! Isn't he handsome!

624
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,476
Look at that!

625
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,481
This is where I had my son.

626
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,524
In this maternity unit.

627
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,901
That's funny.

628
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,153
Not really. The amazing thing is,

629
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,279
my friend Anna...

630
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:43,366
- You saw her up there, you met her. -Yes.

631
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,661
She gave birth here that same night.

632
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,039
This is where we met.

633
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,751
Her child was still born. She asked to breastfeed mine.

634
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,378
Oh my!

635
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,714
I said to her, fine.

636
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,842
Since then, I've often wondered.

637
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,679
They've always been very close.

638
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,764
Anna and my son.

639
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:10,268
I wonder if there wasn't some kind of

640
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,896
imprinting, like with ducks.

641
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,359
With me. on the other hand...

642
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:21,028
- You know... -Sorry, they're paging me.

643
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,282
Sometimes I look at Vincent,

644
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,077
the big lout with nothing special about him

645
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,204
that came out of my belly,

646
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,291
and I have to admit I don't know him.

647
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,146
- Evening, Michéle. -Evening, Rebecca.

648
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,898
Patrick will walk you inside. There's a prowler.

649
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:00,735
- There is? -Patrick fought with him.

650
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,610
- A prowler? -Yes.

651
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,323
They're sending 3 cars after the creep.

652
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:07,241
You fought with him?

653
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,951
I caught him crouched in the bushes,

654
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,786
watching your house.

655
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,830
When I approached, he took off.

656
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,291
You saw his face?

657
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,252
No, he was wearing a mask, like a ski mask.

658
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,338
Like a stalker on a TV show.

659
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:21,839
He got away.

660
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,924
Pat, go in with her.

661
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,718
No, don't bother.

662
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,390
- Do it anyway. -Okay, be right back.

663
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,648
It's really not necessary, honestly.

664
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,318
I have pepper spray in the house.

665
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:43,778
Good to know.

666
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:04,131
Light switch on your left there.

667
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:17,478
Everything seems to be okay.

668
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,398
Thanks, anyway. I appreciate it.

669
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,358
No problem, I didn't do much.

670
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,360
I nearly caught him,

671
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,028
but he took off so fast.

672
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,491
In high school, I ran the 1,000 meters in 2'42".

673
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:35,996
Perhaps his speed shows how scared he was of you.

674
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,584
Thank you for salvaging my pride.

675
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,086
You're welcome.

676
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,428
Well...

677
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,730
See anything or hear anything,just shout.

678
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:02,898
Okay.

679
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,028
I'm a grandmother.

680
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,907
- Congratulations. -Thank you.

681
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,421
God knows why I said that.

682
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,324
Morning, Michéle.

683
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,620
I like your sweater.

684
00:49:58,954 --> 00:49:59,955
Do you ski?

685
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,583
Sure.

686
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:04,835
I'll take you anytime.

687
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:29,360
Kevin?

688
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,862
You shoot, right?

689
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,740
I mean. real shooting.

690
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,492
That's right, I do.

691
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:38,994
You own guns?

692
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,497
A couple.

693
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,335
Could you teach me?

694
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,337
I could show you, sure.

695
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:56,470
In real life, that'd do the job.

696
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:59,223
In real life, he'd run faster.

697
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,766
True.

698
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:02,977
Try the .44 now.

699
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,820
Kevin, I also wanted to talk to you

700
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,031
because I've got an unofficial assignment for you.

701
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:17,950
A black op?

702
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:22,538
I want to know who created that animation.

703
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,332
You know the one I mean?

704
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,713
Hack into the home computers of the whole office.

705
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,215
All the guys, at least.

706
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:38,387
I want to help, but that's a major violation.

707
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,265
I'm offering $10,000 cash in hand.

708
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,019
Between you and me. Our secret.

709
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,608
When you snoop on people, you turn up some weird shit.

710
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:54,320
I know. I won'tjudge.

711
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,157
Where does this one go?

712
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,117
Put it right there.

713
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,653
I untangled that one. Try it.

714
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,906
- This one? -On the right. I'll do the other next.

715
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,409
- Hi, Rebecca! -Hi. Michéle.

716
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,536
Beautiful!

717
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,621
- Evening. -Evening.

718
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,834
The Nativity gets me every time. Where it all began.

719
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,087
Very true.

720
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,176
I know it's rude to invite you last minute,

721
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:25,471
but I'm having a Christmas get-together tomorrow.

722
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,306
Patrick, did you hear that?

723
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,348
Yeah.

724
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,226
With pleasure.

725
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,603
Yes, with pleasure, absolutely.

726
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,647
Well then...

727
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,274
See you tomorrow.

728
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,650
- See you then. -See you then.

729
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:39,735
Thank you.

730
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,911
In theory, we could put a toothpick

731
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,746
inside one for Richard's ladylove.

732
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,332
Or just poison her.

733
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,918
She has me pegged as a Medea, She'd see it coming.

734
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,377
Consumed by jealousy.

735
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,671
She was a classics major, too?

736
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,637
- Josie. -Robert.

737
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,013
Merry Christmas!

738
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,431
- Okay, Dad? -Great.

739
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:10,557
Hi, kiddo.

740
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:13,060
Jeez, he stinks. Here!

741
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,021
How you doing?

742
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:20,484
You trying to deafen us all with your shit? Careful.

743
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,860
Hello, all!

744
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,404
Merry Christmas!

745
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,829
If I ever show up like that, kill me.

746
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:33,288
Evening!

747
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,000
- Evening! -Evening!

748
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,670
Sorry we're late. I was digging out a great...

749
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,712
Excuse me.

750
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,422
Cabernet.

751
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,510
- Evening! -Evening!

752
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,220
Scrabble party!

753
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,390
Thank you.

754
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,474
- Evening! -Evening!

755
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,976
Any more alerts?

756
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,228
No, the bogeyman's deserted us.

757
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:59,273
Anyway, we're safe tonight.

758
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,900
I got my red belt in March.

759
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:06,154
I did Taekwondo for years before switching to Shotokan.

760
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:07,739
I've never done karate.

761
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,700
She was making fun of me.

762
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,368
Ok.

763
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,833
You can't avoid me all night.

764
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:18,917
Want a bet?

765
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:27,801
I'm glad you made it.

766
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,595
We don't get out much.

767
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:32,723
Unfortunately for Rebecca, who's a very social person.

768
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:34,766
Unlike me.

769
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,978
I'm glad she dragged you over here tonight.

770
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,607
It was no hardship.

771
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,067
Good evening!

772
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,361
So sorry I'm late.

773
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,155
I couldn't get off work.

774
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,407
Wejust sat down. Hi, Héléne.

775
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,700
- Evening! -Evening!

776
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,368
Evening, everybody.

777
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:54,661
Iréne, this is Héléne.

778
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,163
- Evening! -Evening!

779
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,081
- Evening. I'm Ralf. -Evening.

780
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,418
Well, enjoy your meal!

781
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,544
Thanks

782
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:04,922
I'm sorry...

783
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,508
I'd like to say grace, if nobody objects.

784
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:11,970
Of course not. Please do.

785
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,513
Thank you.

786
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,061
Bless us, Lord, and bless this meal.

787
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:21,355
And provide bread to the needy.

788
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,147
Amen.

789
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,108
- Amen. -Amen.

790
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,568
Wine, Michéle?

791
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,111
With pleasure.

792
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,280
So, Patrick, what do you do?

793
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:31,782
I work in banking.

794
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,494
I'm a broker. And I plead guilty.

795
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,037
How come?

796
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:41,500
Just joking. It's not a popular profession right now.

797
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,043
It never was.

798
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,213
- I guess not. -Well.

799
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:47,881
To Christmas!

800
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,257
And to us!

801
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:53,595
Especially the newcomers to our table...

802
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:54,930
Iréne,

803
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,182
Patrick,

804
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,767
Rebecca.

805
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,397
Ralf.

806
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:05,107
Ralf.

807
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:06,733
Merry Christmas!

808
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:08,777
Merry Christmas!

809
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,699
Michéle's worked like a trooper.

810
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:14,741
Absolutely.

811
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:16,910
I love cooking.

812
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,328
When are you going?

813
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:21,581
I'll try to book the...

814
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,169
But the period we want books up fast.

815
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:29,881
People don't realize the art muscle needs training.

816
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,634
Or else culture collapses, goes flabby.

817
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,512
That's what we've got now. Flabby culture.

818
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,347
Is that aimed at me?

819
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:38,974
Originality or singularity

820
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:42,185
used to be valued and sought after.

821
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:45,522
Or even an end in itself. Now it's a liability.

822
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,149
Richard's a theorist.

823
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,401
I'm not talking about novelty.

824
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,862
Coming out of our ass, novelty!

825
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,655
Delightful image at dinner.

826
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:56,742
Anyway, what's inspiration? 80% hard work.

827
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:59,703
Some people know nothing of hard work.

828
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,912
It's not in their culture.

829
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:03,081
We know who you mean.

830
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,459
I didn't say a word.

831
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,878
Everybody's different. I love everyone.

832
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,425
We're all children of God!

833
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:17,179
Yeah, Africans eat goat's innards. They're different.

834
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,220
Exactly.

835
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,599
I went on safari in Kenya. It was great.

836
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,224
Right, there you go.

837
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,769
I think now is a good time.

838
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,772
I have an announcement to make.

839
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:32,027
Ralf and I are engaged to be married.

840
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:43,580
Sorry.

841
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:48,668
How do you manage to be so grotesque?

842
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,630
Don't you realize?

843
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,926
I hope everyone likes blueberries.

844
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:00,263
Josie added a ton to the official recipe.

845
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:04,476
I was feeling creative, so I added blueberries.

846
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,605
Looks good to me.

847
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:15,904
It's almost midnight. Do you mind if I put on the Mass?

848
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,239
On the contrary.

849
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:24,955
You're leaving?

850
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,499
It was wonderful. Really.

851
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,001
Next time, our turn. You'll come to us.

852
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,962
Let's not rush things.

853
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,004
Leave it to us.

854
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:37,008
We'll have lunch first, Michéle and I.

855
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:38,260
Just the two of us.

856
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,512
One step at a time.

857
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,305
I agree, excellent idea.

858
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,431
Goodnight.

859
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:44,474
Great.

860
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,601
- See you! -See you!

861
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,313
See you, 'night!

862
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,569
Flirting with the banker, was that a test?

863
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:59,072
You're making a scene in my home? It's come to that?

864
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,952
- We'll talk later. -Make yourself useful.

865
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:18,257
Disaster!

866
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,802
- That's two double words. -One double word.

867
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:22,470
I can top that.

868
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,097
Journey!

869
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:26,474
-64. -Hold on, I've got it.

870
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:27,766
No, that's 70.

871
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,436
70, you see.

872
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,729
My bad.

873
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,771
- Ladies... -No, thanks.

874
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,399
- Sure? -Really.

875
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:41,406
Curse him! Damn him!

876
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:44,951
Close the book, ring the bell, blow out the candle.

877
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,162
What's that?

878
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:48,914
Call yourself a Catholic?

879
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:51,249
You don't know the excommunication rite?

880
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:53,293
And you do?

881
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,504
I've heard about it.

882
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,925
My father made the sign of the cross on me,

883
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:01,635
before I left for school.

884
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,929
He did it to all the local kids

885
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,765
until some parents asked him to stop.

886
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,183
Sounds reasonable.

887
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,269
Apparently, my father was offended.

888
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,647
That night. he made the rounds.

889
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,524
Knocked on every door,

890
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,027
went into every house on the street

891
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,778
with a shotgun, a butcher's mallet

892
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,656
and a pair of kitchen knives.

893
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,617
Yes, I heard about that.

894
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:30,830
You heard about the 27 human victims, not about the animals.

895
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:32,999
They never get a mention.

896
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,793
6 dogs,

897
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,420
a couple of cats, too.

898
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,966
For whatever reason, he spared a hamster.

899
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,134
You couldn't make it up.

900
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:52,060
I was doing my homework when he arrived home

901
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,770
with blood all over him.

902
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,231
My mother was at work.

903
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,566
She was a nurse back then.

904
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,903
Can you imagine my mother. a nurse?

905
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:03,780
Funny, isn't it?

906
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,573
We don't have to go over it.

907
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,868
I don't mind. It does me good to talk.

908
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,998
He decided to burn everything in the house.

909
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,500
I helped feed the fire.

910
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,211
We gutted the place. Curtains, carpets...

911
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:19,671
Tables, chairs...

912
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,006
All in the fire.

913
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,843
It was exciting. You get caught up in it.

914
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,973
We were about to burn our clothes when the police arrived.

915
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,683
Someone snapped a photo.

916
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:36,646
Bizarrely, it's that photo that stuck in people's minds.

917
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:40,025
Me, half-naked, smeared with ash.

918
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,486
The photo of a little girl as psychopath,

919
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:45,405
next to her father,

920
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,032
the psychopath.

921
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,204
My empty stare in the photo is terrifying.

922
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,838
Not bad, huh?

923
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:04,549
Cognac?

924
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,135
- Love one. -Same glass okay?

925
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:10,847
Cognac anyone?

926
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,557
- Me, please. -Whiskey.

927
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,476
- Champagne, please. -I'm out.

928
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,020
So, one whiskey and one cognac.

929
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,563
Are you aware

930
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,232
how mean you were to me at dinner?

931
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:22,566
Yes, I am.

932
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,777
You're cruel

933
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:26,404
when you find anything or anyone unpleasant.

934
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,323
I'm on the list, apparently.

935
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:31,534
Neither of us is drunk enough for this conversation.

936
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,869
Okay?

937
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,299
-Iréne! -lréne!

938
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:47,509
What's happened?

939
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:48,927
Can you hear me?

940
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,678
I don't believe it!

941
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,389
You better believe it!

942
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:12,742
What?

943
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,204
Go see...

944
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,081
your father.

945
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,466
She's had a major stroke.

946
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:33,430
We alleviated the pressure on her brain
but she remains unresponsive.

947
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:36,266
Unresponsive. meaning?

948
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:38,560
She is comatose.

949
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,895
How long for?

950
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,107
Sorry, there's no telling.

951
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:46,860
- I mean, she's stable... -This is real?

952
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:48,987
Excuse me?

953
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,530
No. I mean...

954
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:55,702
There's no way she's faking it or playing it up?

955
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:59,080
You're medically certain this is for real?

956
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,752
I'm sorry, but yes it's for real.

957
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:09,632
In fact, there's a strong probability your mother will not wake up.

958
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,970
But as I say, she's stable right now.

959
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,931
I suggest you get some rest.

960
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,559
There's nothing you can do here now.

961
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:23,146
We'll call you if there's any news.

962
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,070
Goodbye and thank you.

963
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,530
Be strong.

964
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:45,752
Well?

965
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:47,962
It's not good.

966
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,381
Do you mind sleeping in the guest room?

967
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:52,217
<i>No.</i>

968
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,010
You're sleeping with me.

969
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,560
Did you see Richard with Héléne?

970
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:03,728
I did.

971
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,397
Telling the same old stories.

972
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,566
And she seemed amused by them all.

973
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,027
You'll wind up being good friends.

974
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,112
No doubt.

975
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:16,032
I'll go over for dinner,just the three of us.

976
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,118
I picture myself at their door with a box of macaroons.

977
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,204
It makes me want to puke!

978
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,315
You remember in Cassie?

979
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:51,859
We tried.

980
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,908
It was hopeless. we couldn't stop laughing.

981
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,769
What are you doing?

982
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:29,772
Anna's gone to the office. I was trying to cheer you up.

983
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:32,650
Oddly, your stupidity was what first attracted me.

984
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,653
Sorry if I misjudged.

985
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:37,572
I can't do this anymore. We have to stop.

986
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,533
You were great and everything.

987
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:41,909
We'll stay friends but...

988
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:44,203
Are you kidding?

989
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,874
This whole ridiculous situation is unbearable, right?

990
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,626
Don't you think?

991
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:50,752
<i>No.</i>

992
01:08:58,259 --> 01:08:59,677
Your breasts are bigger.

993
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,346
Not that I'm aware of.

994
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:02,722
I'm telling you.

995
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:09,687
Say you don't want me anymore and we're done.

996
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:11,648
It's not that simple.

997
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:14,317
But if you like...

998
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:17,987
I don't want this anymore, this situation, the lies.

999
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,907
You dodged my question.

1000
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:23,618
Sorry.

1001
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,453
I don't want to fuck you anymore.

1002
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,372
Was that the question?

1003
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,004
I won't see him.

1004
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,798
I'm not superstitious.

1005
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,592
I couldn't care less about death-bed requests.

1006
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,971
If you hope to keep manipulating me with this abject stunt...

1007
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:48,184
Ever since you gave up on basic morality,

1008
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:51,145
acting out like a spoiled teenager,

1009
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,398
you never gave a shit what I thought.

1010
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,149
How much it hurt me.

1011
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:59,612
This aneurysm thing is just treachery.

1012
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:01,698
Disgusting.

1013
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,953
Like this salad, with its shitty olives.

1014
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:14,127
You can't stay mad at me till the end.

1015
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:31,519
Sure, the news channel works fine.

1016
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,395
She's in v-tach.

1017
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:34,897
What's going on?

1018
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,067
What's that beep?

1019
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:39,818
Ma'am. please.

1020
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,279
Cardiac arrest!

1021
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:47,118
20 mg of GTN.

1022
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:49,245
No change. Up it to 40!

1023
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,789
Still no change.

1024
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:53,708
We're losing her.

1025
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1026
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,219
What are you doing?

1027
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,795
I'm looking for a spot with some significance.

1028
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,799
It's not like there'll be a sign that says,

1029
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,718
"Dispose of mother here.“

1030
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:09,594
His pacifier.

1031
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:13,139
We had a picnic there once, that hollow there.

1032
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:16,434
I remember only too well.

1033
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:20,313
Her chicken salad gave me horrific gas.

1034
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,522
You forgot it?

1035
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,776
How can you be such an idiot?

1036
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,029
Three times I reminded you.

1037
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,990
At home and in the car. You enjoy this?

1038
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,950
See how she talks to him?

1039
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,493
Give up the Xbox, moron!

1040
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:36,412
Stop it.

1041
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,915
Stop it? Stop what?

1042
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:40,791
I'm embarrassing you?

1043
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:43,377
All you deserve, asshole!

1044
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,635
Baby blues.

1045
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:55,181
I hope my boy doesn't inherit her temperament.

1046
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,641
Vincent,

1047
01:13:56,724 --> 01:14:00,227
he's cute but he's not your son. You know that, right?

1048
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:01,562
<i>Found Kt.</i>

1049
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:03,898
Josie!

1050
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,733
Are you listening?

1051
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:06,817
What's up?

1052
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,235
He's not your son.

1053
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,947
Look at his skin.

1054
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:14,283
It's two tones darker than yours or Josie's.

1055
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,827
Don't you see?

1056
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:20,456
- Whose is he, if he's not mine? -He's his father's!

1057
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,333
His father's not you.

1058
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,627
Sorry, but you're being made a fool of.

1059
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:28,756
Don't lay a finger on me.

1060
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,093
Cunt!

1061
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,511
What? Say that again.

1062
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:34,303
Cunt!

1063
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:36,222
- What? -Cunt!

1064
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:38,849
Vincent

1065
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,562
Stop!

1066
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:45,356
I know why you're angry.

1067
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,066
Leave me alone.

1068
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:50,486
So what now?

1069
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,951
Okay, this'll have to do.

1070
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,163
The Wind's picking up.

1071
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:28,315
Sorry to bother you. I saw your shutters open.

1072
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:29,859
Come in.

1073
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:33,237
Sorry if I'm disturbing you...

1074
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,530
You're not.

1075
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:37,158
With your shutters open and a storm brewing,

1076
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,118
your windows'll shatter.

1077
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,619
That would be bad timing.

1078
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,705
The wind can do serious damage.

1079
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:43,789
I know.

1080
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:46,375
You weren't here in '99. The end of the world.

1081
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:49,086
I believe it. You need a hand?

1082
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:51,297
Perhaps, yes. Thanks.

1083
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:54,175
I never counted. but there must be

1084
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,635
something like 20 windows in this house.

1085
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,055
It's a westerly, so let's start there.

1086
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,389
In the kitchen.

1087
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:30,753
You're cold?

1088
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:32,463
A little.

1089
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:37,968
Next window perhaps?

1090
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,014
Okay.

1091
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:48,979
I wasn't expecting anyone.

1092
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,572
Looks like a Grumman Wildcat.

1093
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,324
I don't know.

1094
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,993
I'd love to restore one.

1095
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:05,955
And fly it to New York.

1096
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:08,332
You're a pilot?

1097
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,292
<i>No.</i>

1098
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,253
You've got to have a dream.

1099
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:21,178
Let's start with that one.

1100
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:04,513
Sorry.

1101
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:28,078
The Summoning scene needs to come later.

1102
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:30,998
- No. this is... -Kurt, we have no time to argue.

1103
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:33,000
The player encounters Kira

1104
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,752
in her sweet, schoolteacher persona

1105
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:36,837
before her Dark Rebirth.

1106
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,923
- Or there's no boner moment! -Right.

1107
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,219
- Michéle. -Yes?

1108
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:44,511
Got a minute?

1109
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:46,639
Yeah.

1110
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:51,268
I found something on Kurt's private server.

1111
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:54,521
It looks like he's into crushing.

1112
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:57,816
What's "crushing"?

1113
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,236
What it sounds like. Crush-sh.

1114
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,112
Emoy

1115
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,913
Twisted, but hardly a smoking gun.

1116
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:12,873
I guess not.

1117
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,925
Good work. Keep on it.

1118
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,172
Ash girl.

1119
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:24,486
Deliciously nasty.

1120
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:26,989
Deliciously nasty.

1121
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:38,459
You're here?

1122
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:45,215
You're mad?

1123
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:46,842
I'm mostly curious.

1124
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:49,636
I guess I should explain.

1125
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,602
I was never going to show it to anyone.

1126
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,396
Philippe Kwan ripped it off my computer

1127
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,147
and sent it out.

1128
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:02,649
But you created it?

1129
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:05,777
Yes.

1130
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:06,570
Why?

1131
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:10,449
At first, as a game idea

1132
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:11,950
based on true crime photos.

1133
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:13,786
Then it got weird.

1134
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:16,372
Nobody would've seen it

1135
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:18,040
if that asshole Kwan hadn't...

1136
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:20,334
If I'm fired, he deserves it too.

1137
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:24,505
Take out your dick.

1138
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:28,717
Pardon me?

1139
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:31,261
Show me your dick and I might not fire you.

1140
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:51,031
It's pretty.

1141
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:53,200
Manon.

1142
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:56,203
You look circumcised.

1143
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,166
I still get the 10 grand?

1144
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:03,794
That's a no.

1145
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:06,380
And delete all that.

1146
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:31,280
Fantastic!

1147
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1148
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,666
Get out!

1149
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:07,751
Get out!

1150
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,294
Get out of here!

1151
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:12,965
Get out!

1152
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:21,658
A wave of enthusiasm in Spain.

1153
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:25,746
Pope Francis will join crowds of pilgrims walking barefoot

1154
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:28,999
on the road to Santiago de Compostela.

1155
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:30,208
In France,

1156
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:33,128
Georges Leblanc stays in prison, unsurprisingly.

1157
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:35,297
The serial killer failed

1158
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:38,634
in his latest application for parole.

1159
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,970
Georges Leblanc is 76 years old.

1160
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:45,307
He must wait ten years to apply again.

1161
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:47,351
His lawyers announced <i>he...</i>

1162
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:56,401
Fuck you, fuck you!

1163
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:37,776
I'm Michele Leblanc. I called yesterday.

1164
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:39,653
Right.

1165
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:42,155
Wait there for someone to come get you.

1166
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:43,365
Thank you.

1167
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:56,503
Ms. Leblanc?

1168
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,257
- I'm the Assistant Warden. -Hi.

1169
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:03,051
- A coffee or something? -No, thanks.

1170
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:06,847
Can we talk in my office if you don't mind? This way...

1171
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:09,641
I'm here to spit in my father's face.

1172
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,601
I can't guarantee it's a metaphor.

1173
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:12,936
People have all kinds of reasons.

1174
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:19,109
I came because I gave the bastard too much power over me.

1175
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:22,404
My whole life fleeing him, fearing him.

1176
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:25,282
What a waste!

1177
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:26,783
Ms. Leblanc...

1178
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:28,910
Your father is dead.

1179
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:33,248
Shortly before 8 am,

1180
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:35,834
we found him deceased in his cell.

1181
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:37,919
HOW?

1182
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:40,213
There'll be an investigation,

1183
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:43,800
but he appears to have hanged himself with a sheet.

1184
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:56,062
When did this happen?

1185
01:27:57,397 --> 01:28:01,485
We only know it must have been between 7pm and 7am.

1186
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:12,579
At what time was my father notified that I was coming today?

1187
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:18,376
Shortly before 7pm.

1188
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:22,798
Your mother requested cremation,

1189
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:25,425
with a vault for his ashes next to hers.

1190
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:29,054
She won't be there, even if her plaque's next to his.

1191
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,781
I had a list of things to say to him.

1192
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:49,533
Nine bullet points.

1193
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,082
I killed you by coming here.

1194
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:21,647
Hello?

1195
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,816
Emilie Fontaine, reporter at Le Parisien.

1196
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:28,280
I was wondering if you'd like to comment
on your father's passing.

1197
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
How did you get this number?
I realize it's an awkward time.
It's an opportunity for you...

1198
01:29:43,086 --> 01:29:43,837
Hello?

1199
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:45,714
Ms. Leblanc?

1200
01:29:46,882 --> 01:29:47,924
Ms. Leblanc?

1201
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,093
Are you feeling anger?

1202
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:52,095
Grief?

1203
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,264
Relief perhaps?

1204
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:11,698
Anna's voice-mail. I can't take your...

1205
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:17,829
This is Richard. Leave me a message.

1206
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,577
How are you feeling?

1207
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:00,455
How am I feeling?

1208
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:03,041
Are you dizzy? Head spinning?

1209
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:05,460
- No. I'm fine, I think. -Ok.

1210
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,045
Except my leg-

1211
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:11,883
Don't bother. It's jammed.

1212
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:14,386
Unbuckle and I'll help you out.

1213
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:42,080
You should let me look at it.

1214
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:43,999
I played soccer.

1215
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:46,835
Great, so what?

1216
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:50,380
I mean, I know a bit about leg injuries.

1217
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:53,842
As a teen, I tore my anterior cruciate ligament.

1218
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,176
Okay?

1219
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:57,929
One year of rehab.

1220
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:04,019
Alright, I'd better disinfect it now.

1221
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:10,065
A nasty sprain.

1222
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:11,526
It needs treatment.

1223
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:26,958
So, how was it?

1224
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:44,184
Was it good? How was it?

1225
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:56,362
Answer me. Did you enjoy it?

1226
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:09,918
Why did you do it?

1227
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:17,383
It was necessary.

1228
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:41,032
- Have a good day, ma'am. -Thanks. goodbye.

1229
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:01,052
Stop it, Michéle. You can't do this.

1230
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:02,846
What can't I do?

1231
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:05,265
Walking in without ringing the bell.

1232
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:08,059
I have a key, Ralf. Why ring the bell?

1233
01:34:08,434 --> 01:34:10,228
Ignore me, I won't be long.

1234
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:12,146
It's not about how long.

1235
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:14,566
- Don't be unpleasant. -You have to go immediately.

1236
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:16,609
I own this apartment!

1237
01:34:16,818 --> 01:34:18,820
Yes, well I will be going...

1238
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:21,865
This is not the time.

1239
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:24,868
Anyway I put on sale, that's why I'm here.

1240
01:34:28,872 --> 01:34:30,707
I saw your father passed away.

1241
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:33,710
One less bastard in the world.

1242
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,798
You should start packing your bags.

1243
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:43,553
I saw all the shows on TV about you and your dad.

1244
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:45,722
When you murdered all those people.

1245
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,731
I saw all the corpses, all the dead children.

1246
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:03,406
The bastard's dead now, and at least I fucked his wife.

1247
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:14,417
Hello?

1248
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,293
It's Robert.

1249
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:18,379
Anna's gone to her London meeting. My afternoon's free.

1250
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:19,631
Robert.

1251
01:35:20,048 --> 01:35:20,924
I was going to call.

1252
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:23,593
I sprained my knee. It's in a brace.

1253
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:25,386
I can hardly walk.

1254
01:35:25,762 --> 01:35:28,223
So? We're not going skiing.

1255
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:52,997
You were fabulous.

1256
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:55,124
Where'd you get the idea of playing dead?

1257
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:57,835
Anyway. you got what you wanted.

1258
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:00,421
See, I'm as good as my word.

1259
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:01,881
Now that...

1260
01:36:02,382 --> 01:36:05,134
It was a very peculiar sensation.

1261
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:08,554
So we can still be friends.

1262
01:36:11,349 --> 01:36:13,059
You know what I mean by "friends"?

1263
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:15,353
No more fucking.

1264
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:24,821
Vincent

1265
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:31,411
What are you doing here?

1266
01:36:34,539 --> 01:36:36,207
Josie kicked me out.

1267
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:38,209
What happened?

1268
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:40,420
I don't know.

1269
01:36:41,671 --> 01:36:43,131
So think about it.

1270
01:36:43,715 --> 01:36:45,883
There must be a reason, however demented.

1271
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:47,302
There's a reason.

1272
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:49,178
I lost my job.

1273
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:50,596
Lost?

1274
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:52,556
I resigned.

1275
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:54,600
- You resigned? -I had to.

1276
01:36:54,767 --> 01:36:56,185
My car broke down.

1277
01:36:57,103 --> 01:36:59,646
You resigned because your car broke down?

1278
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:02,775
It's one hour there, one hour back, from the house.

1279
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:04,235
That's unhealthy.

1280
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:08,698
I saw a thing on TV about air quality in the subway.

1281
01:37:12,035 --> 01:37:13,578
You brought him here?

1282
01:37:16,706 --> 01:37:19,125
- I had no choice. -No choice?

1283
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:23,338
Josie threatened to go to America.

1284
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:25,256
And take Lucien along.

1285
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:28,634
I can't believe I'm defending her

1286
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:30,928
but she has a right to be mad at you.

1287
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:34,974
You have responsibilities, an apartment, and you quit your job?

1288
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:37,185
You say it exactly like her.

1289
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:39,895
My car broke down. That's not my fault!

1290
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:42,315
You have to give that baby back right now.

1291
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:44,984
You're not married. It could be seen as kidnapping.

1292
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:46,652
Kidnapping? He's my son!

1293
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:49,238
My Son!

1294
01:37:49,322 --> 01:37:50,656
Alright, he's your son.

1295
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:51,949
No, not alright.

1296
01:37:55,161 --> 01:37:56,621
Who could that be?

1297
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:03,753
Where is he?

1298
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:05,296
- Who? -My baby!

1299
01:38:06,339 --> 01:38:08,466
- Where is he? -Upstairs.

1300
01:38:09,759 --> 01:38:12,095
My baby! What did you do to him?

1301
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:13,388
What did I do to him?

1302
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:15,807
I wouldn't trust you with a hamster!

1303
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:18,309
Let go! Let go of me!

1304
01:38:18,393 --> 01:38:19,685
Let go of her.

1305
01:38:19,769 --> 01:38:21,479
Let go of me, dammit!

1306
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:23,313
Let go of her!

1307
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:24,649
Let go of me!

1308
01:38:27,527 --> 01:38:28,569
Vincent!

1309
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:29,987
What?

1310
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:35,243
He's my baby, get it?

1311
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:38,621
My child!

1312
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:53,553
It was always about the baby for you.

1313
01:38:54,804 --> 01:38:56,722
You were in it for his sake.

1314
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:00,643
I could be a good father.

1315
01:39:01,644 --> 01:39:02,854
I know it.

1316
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:10,611
These?

1317
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:14,323
Sure, but unsalted ones.

1318
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:18,578
Hi, Vincent.

1319
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:20,620
- Okay? -And you?

1320
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:23,458
Buy Bonne Vie. They're made in Florange.

1321
01:39:29,672 --> 01:39:30,923
Evening, Michéle.

1322
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:33,718
How's your knee?

1323
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:35,386
And you? Your hand?

1324
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:38,097
Patrick said Bonne Vie unsalted chips

1325
01:39:38,181 --> 01:39:40,641
are made in Florange.

1326
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:45,354
Rebecca's on a trip and left tons of lasagna.

1327
01:39:45,605 --> 01:39:47,607
I'll never be able to finish it.

1328
01:39:48,733 --> 01:39:50,610
I got this to go with it.

1329
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:53,446
Sounds good to me.

1330
01:39:57,992 --> 01:39:59,619
Yes. sure.

1331
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:02,538
No, thanks.

1332
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:07,251
Where did Rebecca and her parents go?

1333
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:10,296
To see the Pope in Santiago de Compostela.

1334
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:13,216
Driving and on foot at the end.

1335
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:15,968
I saw he'll be saying mass in the cathedral.

1336
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:17,970
The Pope.

1337
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:21,933
I have a hard time imagining the guy barefoot.

1338
01:40:22,308 --> 01:40:25,978
It's so weird to think he's a real person, like with feet.

1339
01:40:30,316 --> 01:40:32,151
Go easy, sweetheart.

1340
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:46,165
He's out.

1341
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:48,960
Eyes bigger than his belly.

1342
01:40:50,336 --> 01:40:51,587
Thank you.

1343
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:25,496
The floor's warm.

1344
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:30,710
It's a wood boiler. I installed it myself.

1345
01:41:32,545 --> 01:41:33,921
Sounds like a job.

1346
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:36,173
Yes.

1347
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:39,218
Works by inverted flame combustion.

1348
01:41:41,137 --> 01:41:43,222
Inverted flame combustion?

1349
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:46,851
- Sounds like you just made it up. -No.

1350
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:48,769
I'm not making anything up.

1351
01:41:58,195 --> 01:41:59,447
It's in the basement.

1352
01:42:05,411 --> 01:42:06,829
I can imagine.

1353
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:12,209
You want to see it?

1354
01:42:21,594 --> 01:42:22,511
Ok.

1355
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:02,593
There we are.

1356
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:07,390
All noise is muffled by the door.

1357
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:21,195
- Vincent's upstairs. -Yes, he is.

1358
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:35,418
<i>Do it.</i>

1359
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:43,634
It doesn't work like that.

1360
01:43:44,385 --> 01:43:45,511
Not for me.

1361
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:48,139
It has to be like before.

1362
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:56,665
Let's go.

1363
01:45:10,930 --> 01:45:12,389
Thank you for dinner.

1364
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:13,349
Anytime.

1365
01:45:45,673 --> 01:45:46,382
Kurt.

1366
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:49,218
Bravo.

1367
01:45:53,389 --> 01:45:55,891
Anna, I have an idea.

1368
01:45:56,225 --> 01:45:57,852
The party for the game launch.

1369
01:45:57,935 --> 01:45:59,812
We could ask Vincent to organize it.

1370
01:46:00,104 --> 01:46:01,230
Good idea.

1371
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:05,317
I know I was always against throwing work Vincent's way but...

1372
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:09,280
What's wrong?

1373
01:46:13,409 --> 01:46:15,035
Robert's fucking someone.

1374
01:46:19,415 --> 01:46:20,666
Are you sure?

1375
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:26,213
I recognized the scent

1376
01:46:26,422 --> 01:46:29,425
of that stupid body wash they use in hotels

1377
01:46:29,508 --> 01:46:31,260
trying to be classy.

1378
01:46:31,635 --> 01:46:33,387
We don't have that at home.

1379
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:38,267
That's your only evidence?

1380
01:46:42,062 --> 01:46:44,023
I smelled his underwear.

1381
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:51,572
I waited all day for him to take off his shorts.

1382
01:46:52,031 --> 01:46:56,035
When he did at last, I pounced on them. And sniffed.

1383
01:46:57,995 --> 01:46:59,622
I felt ashamed beyond words.

1384
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:05,044
Shame isn't a strong enough emotion
to stop us doing anything at all.

1385
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:07,796
Believe me.

1386
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:29,610
You're becoming a regular.

1387
01:47:29,735 --> 01:47:31,153
Looks like it.

1388
01:47:31,236 --> 01:47:33,530
- Your wife? -Couldn't make it.

1389
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:36,533
What do you mean, "Ah"?

1390
01:47:36,784 --> 01:47:39,453
We should've come together. Carpooling is hip.

1391
01:47:40,204 --> 01:47:42,164
How are you?

1392
01:47:42,539 --> 01:47:46,168
Fauchon made this up for us. Taste that. it's awesome.

1393
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:48,504
- Hi. -Hi.

1394
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:49,505
Right this way.

1395
01:47:50,172 --> 01:47:51,382
You're maitre d' tonight?

1396
01:47:51,465 --> 01:47:54,927
Morn put me in charge of the party.

1397
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:56,387
Evening.

1398
01:47:57,429 --> 01:47:59,056
- How are you? -Fine.

1399
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:01,350
- Good evening. -Good evening.

1400
01:48:01,433 --> 01:48:03,227
- How are you? -Good.

1401
01:48:04,269 --> 01:48:06,605
Sorry, lipstick on your cheek.

1402
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:09,233
Welcome to my home.

1403
01:48:10,067 --> 01:48:11,318
Want to give it a try?

1404
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:13,403
No, thanks, I'm no gamer.

1405
01:48:13,404 --> 01:48:14,029
Really?

1406
01:48:14,113 --> 01:48:16,573
- I'd love a go. Show me? -Ok.

1407
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:21,245
- Good evening. -Good evening.

1408
01:48:21,578 --> 01:48:22,788
Can I get you a drink?

1409
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:24,748
- Champagne? -Red wine, please.

1410
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:26,333
I'll switch to red, too.

1411
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:29,003
- Champagne for you? -No, I'm good.

1412
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:31,964
Bottle of red, please.

1413
01:48:32,172 --> 01:48:34,258
I was told to pour glasses.

1414
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:35,884
I'm in charge here.

1415
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,845
I was given specific instructions.

1416
01:48:38,012 --> 01:48:39,680
Whiskey here, please.

1417
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:49,106
Faster, much faster!

1418
01:48:49,231 --> 01:48:51,025
You can press the circle.

1419
01:48:51,275 --> 01:48:52,776
Get him moving now.

1420
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:54,153
Press there to jump.

1421
01:48:57,072 --> 01:48:59,033
You didn't bring Héléne?

1422
01:48:59,616 --> 01:49:01,076
We've met now.

1423
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:04,788
I won't lie to you. It's over.

1424
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:06,790
What happened?

1425
01:49:08,417 --> 01:49:12,212
Laying in bed, I asked her which of my books was her favorite.

1426
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:15,007
Why'd you do that?

1427
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:16,759
She said Scent of Poplar.

1428
01:49:17,176 --> 01:49:18,635
Scent of Poplar

1429
01:49:19,094 --> 01:49:21,555
is a novel by one Pierre Casamayou.

1430
01:49:32,524 --> 01:49:34,777
I'd no idea there were two Casamayous.

1431
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:36,653
Apparently, he's talented.

1432
01:49:38,697 --> 01:49:39,907
Poor Richard.

1433
01:49:40,157 --> 01:49:42,493
Yes, poor Richard.

1434
01:49:56,131 --> 01:49:57,633
So...

1435
01:49:58,092 --> 01:50:02,012
it looks like somehow, despite our best efforts,

1436
01:50:02,346 --> 01:50:04,765
we have a success on our hands.

1437
01:50:05,766 --> 01:50:08,102
All I can say is thank you.

1438
01:50:08,185 --> 01:50:11,730
To your good health and hip hip hooray!

1439
01:50:16,276 --> 01:50:23,867
Michéle! Michéle! Michéle!

1440
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:25,577
Michéle! Michéle!

1441
01:50:29,164 --> 01:50:31,333
Well...

1442
01:50:31,542 --> 01:50:34,253
I couldn't put it any better.

1443
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:38,132
Have a great evening!

1444
01:50:42,511 --> 01:50:43,846
Have you met Richard?

1445
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:47,683
Some time ago, Richard pitched a very interesting idea.

1446
01:50:47,766 --> 01:50:51,603
You two working together could make something fabulous of it.

1447
01:50:51,812 --> 01:50:53,063
I think, at least.

1448
01:50:53,772 --> 01:50:56,024
Talk it over.

1449
01:50:57,234 --> 01:50:59,194
This isn't charity?

1450
01:50:59,278 --> 01:51:03,365
You should know me better than that.

1451
01:51:03,448 --> 01:51:05,701
Go on, tell him your idea.

1452
01:51:07,494 --> 01:51:09,329
So, it's set in a...

1453
01:51:09,454 --> 01:51:11,290
Let me get you a drink.

1454
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:18,547
We can go whenever you want, darling.

1455
01:51:18,714 --> 01:51:21,341
We'll have more fun in bed than here.

1456
01:51:46,575 --> 01:51:48,577
How about a whiskey, guys?

1457
01:51:50,662 --> 01:51:52,414
Give me a minute, then we can go.

1458
01:51:52,497 --> 01:51:54,124
Whatever you say.

1459
01:51:58,212 --> 01:52:00,589
Two whiskeys and an OJ, please.

1460
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:04,218
It's going great!

1461
01:52:06,929 --> 01:52:08,138
It's me.

1462
01:52:09,097 --> 01:52:10,182
What's you?

1463
01:52:12,684 --> 01:52:14,645
It's me, sleeping with Robert.

1464
01:52:18,649 --> 01:52:20,901
It's over now, but it was me.

1465
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:33,205
How long?

1466
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:34,915
6-8 months.

1467
01:52:42,339 --> 01:52:43,882
I didn't have a clue.

1468
01:52:44,633 --> 01:52:46,009
I know.

1469
01:53:00,148 --> 01:53:01,608
What did you do?

1470
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:04,236
I stopped lying-

1471
01:53:17,958 --> 01:53:19,293
- See you. -See you.

1472
01:53:21,461 --> 01:53:23,630
Take my keys. Patrick's driving me home.

1473
01:53:23,714 --> 01:53:26,383
- You're leaving already? -You did wonderfully.

1474
01:53:26,466 --> 01:53:27,509
Relax.

1475
01:53:27,884 --> 01:53:28,802
See you.

1476
01:53:45,277 --> 01:53:46,695
It's twisted.

1477
01:53:49,323 --> 01:53:50,324
- Sorry? -Twisted.

1478
01:53:50,407 --> 01:53:53,201
Between us, it's sick. Diseased.

1479
01:53:57,831 --> 01:54:01,335
I was in some kind of weird denial but I see clearly now.

1480
01:54:04,796 --> 01:54:06,298
What do you see?

1481
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:11,136
You don't expect to get away with what you did to me?

1482
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:18,018
I'll do what I should've done at once.

1483
01:54:19,144 --> 01:54:20,354
What do you mean?

1484
01:54:20,729 --> 01:54:23,648
It's not just about me. There's your wife, too.

1485
01:54:25,484 --> 01:54:27,277
And others, perhaps.

1486
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,404
Who knows.

1487
01:54:31,281 --> 01:54:32,366
What do you mean?

1488
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:36,161
How many others? That you've done the same thing to?

1489
01:54:40,749 --> 01:54:44,211
I'll go to the police. I'll tell them everything.

1490
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1491
01:58:14,504 --> 01:58:16,381
Why?

1492
01:58:37,611 --> 01:58:39,946
It's over.

1493
01:58:49,539 --> 01:58:51,207
It's over.

1494
01:58:54,044 --> 01:58:55,253
It's over.

1495
01:59:05,513 --> 01:59:06,723
Ms. Leblanc?

1496
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:18,151
- Hello. -Hello.

1497
01:59:27,494 --> 01:59:30,664
What was your relationship with the deceased?

1498
01:59:34,125 --> 01:59:35,710
He was my neighbor.

1499
01:59:36,336 --> 01:59:39,673
Like have-a-cup-of-coffee neighbor?

1500
01:59:40,256 --> 01:59:42,300
Borrow-the-lawnmower neighbor?

1501
01:59:43,009 --> 01:59:46,137
No, I never borrowed his lawnmower.

1502
01:59:46,221 --> 01:59:47,931
But it was...

1503
01:59:48,765 --> 01:59:51,142
Yes, that kind of neighbor.

1504
01:59:51,226 --> 01:59:52,894
Until maybe...

1505
01:59:54,854 --> 01:59:55,814
recently.

1506
01:59:56,231 --> 01:59:58,483
When he attended this party with you?

1507
01:59:59,734 --> 02:00:00,443
Yes.

1508
02:00:01,027 --> 02:00:03,780
That's when your relationship became

1509
02:00:04,489 --> 02:00:06,366
more personal?

1510
02:00:10,245 --> 02:00:11,955
Yes. I mean...

1511
02:00:13,707 --> 02:00:15,667
It was heading in that direction.

1512
02:00:17,919 --> 02:00:20,714
When this man appeared in your house, masked,

1513
02:00:21,506 --> 02:00:26,136
you never suspected for a moment it might be your neighbor?

1514
02:00:29,931 --> 02:00:32,308
Who could imagine such a thing?

1515
02:00:50,702 --> 02:00:52,704
- The color okay for you? -Just fine.

1516
02:00:52,912 --> 02:00:54,038
It's perfect.

1517
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:09,511
Careful, the statues are fragile.

1518
02:01:09,512 --> 02:01:10,638
Rebecca!

1519
02:01:13,516 --> 02:01:14,726
Hi.

1520
02:01:16,144 --> 02:01:17,729
You found a buyer?

1521
02:01:17,896 --> 02:01:20,023
I took a bit of a hit, but not too bad.

1522
02:01:20,106 --> 02:01:22,108
The realtor did a great job.

1523
02:01:22,484 --> 02:01:24,611
I'll give you his details. If ever you...

1524
02:01:24,694 --> 02:01:26,738
I'm not going anywhere.

1525
02:01:31,326 --> 02:01:32,911
Stuff piles up.

1526
02:01:34,287 --> 02:01:35,997
I wanted you to know...

1527
02:01:36,998 --> 02:01:38,374
I'm

1528
02:01:39,751 --> 02:01:42,462
I'm very sorry for all you've been through.

1529
02:01:44,589 --> 02:01:46,382
Fortunately, I have faith.

1530
02:01:47,133 --> 02:01:49,761
What's it for if not to get through tough times?

1531
02:01:50,762 --> 02:01:54,808
Patrick was a good man but he had a tortured soul.

1532
02:02:01,773 --> 02:02:03,650
- Good bye. -Good bye.

1533
02:02:06,486 --> 02:02:07,487
Michéle!

1534
02:02:09,155 --> 02:02:12,283
I'm sincerely glad you could give him what he needed.

1535
02:02:12,367 --> 02:02:13,785
For a time, at least.

1536
02:02:32,303 --> 02:02:33,513
Hey there!

1537
02:02:34,264 --> 02:02:35,723
Wow, beautiful!

1538
02:02:35,807 --> 02:02:36,683
Check it out.

1539
02:02:36,975 --> 02:02:38,476
Josie let me choose.

1540
02:02:40,103 --> 02:02:41,271
A convertible.

1541
02:02:41,354 --> 02:02:42,605
He's earned it.

1542
02:02:42,730 --> 02:02:43,857
Hello.

1543
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:48,945
Let's go.

1544
02:02:51,322 --> 02:02:52,615
Baby!

1545
02:02:58,204 --> 02:02:59,163
Happy?

1546
02:03:00,498 --> 02:03:01,708
Crazy!

1547
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:30,570
I heard you were here.

1548
02:03:35,533 --> 02:03:36,993
Physically, anyway-

1549
02:03:48,796 --> 02:03:51,007
We're going ahead with Richard's project?

1550
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:53,343
Let him fool around for a while.

1551
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:57,305
How's Robert?

1552
02:03:59,933 --> 02:04:02,310
- I kicked him out. -No.

1553
02:04:02,852 --> 02:04:05,021
Ever since, he's hit the bottle.

1554
02:04:06,022 --> 02:04:07,649
What did you see in him?

1555
02:04:08,274 --> 02:04:10,068
It was just one of those things.

1556
02:04:10,526 --> 02:04:11,694
An opportunity.

1557
02:04:12,779 --> 02:04:14,113
I wanted to get laid.

1558
02:04:17,075 --> 02:04:20,203
That's no excuse. It was shabby.

1559
02:04:21,704 --> 02:04:23,289
Worse than that even.

1560
02:04:33,967 --> 02:04:35,677
Vincent's grown up now.

1561
02:04:36,761 --> 02:04:38,179
It's just the two of us.

1562
02:04:39,681 --> 02:04:41,933
And I'm all alone in that huge house.

1563
02:04:43,017 --> 02:04:44,310
I'm going to sell it.

1564
02:04:45,603 --> 02:04:49,607
I was thinking I could move in with you for a while.
