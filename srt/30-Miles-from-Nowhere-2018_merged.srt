00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

3
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:17,919
Oh, shit!

4
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:21,056
Shit.

5
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:43,945
Max?

6
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,482
Norma?

7
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:13,207
This girl is how old?

8
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:14,407
23.

9
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:17,244
Ah wow, that is...
even for Jack.

10
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:18,477
Yeah well, he's in LA.

11
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,846
23 is like, you
know, fossilized.

12
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:22,850
He's become
that guy, you know,

13
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:24,651
the one you see with
some teenage girl,

14
00:03:24,653 --> 00:03:26,786
think he's a father
with his daughter

15
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:28,488
until he like, kisses
her on the mouth

16
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,023
or smacks her ass.

17
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:31,291
Then you don't know whether
to call Family Services

18
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:32,826
or just call him an asshole.

19
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:34,928
Yeah, an asshole who's
getting 23-year-old pussy.

20
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,363
Is it that much better?

21
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:38,231
Yeah it's something
that every man covets.

22
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:41,300
Why, because it makes your
dick feel less geriatric?

23
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:42,703
That's right.

24
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:45,371
Um, excuse me, what kind
of tequila do you have?

25
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:46,741
The one with the worm.

26
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:48,841
Jesus.

27
00:03:48,843 --> 00:03:50,543
It is a college bar,
what do you want?

28
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:52,478
Fine, I'll take
that on the rocks.

29
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,382
No worm.

30
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:55,881
Hi, yes, sorry.

31
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:58,518
What cabernets do you have?

32
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,755
The red one.

33
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,125
I will take it.

34
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:04,691
Embarrassing.

35
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:06,393
I cannot believe we drank here.

36
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:07,427
You practically slept here.

37
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:08,961
That I did.

38
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:11,165
Remember Funny Hat Fridays?

39
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:13,366
Ah, I was always the pirate.

40
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:14,669
Oh, you were.

41
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:21,274
So what do you
think the note said?

42
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:23,676
Probably "Sorry I bailed,
sorry I made you fly

43
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:25,779
"800 miles to my funeral
in the middle of Larry's

44
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:26,846
"fucking busy season."

45
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:28,214
No, I mean about his wife.

46
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:30,384
Like do people say
why or just goodbye?

47
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:31,186
I don't know.

48
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:35,189
It probably just said "Fuck
you, I win, love Max."

49
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:36,990
Oh come on.

50
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:37,925
Good luck finishing
a crossword puzzle.

51
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:39,293
Oh my god, totally.

52
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,062
Who does Sundays in pen?

53
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:43,165
So aggressive.

54
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:49,872
By the way, I'm so
sorry about your mom.

55
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:52,238
But I...

56
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,007
Ah, well, that's what
happens when you have

57
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:57,110
a gastric bypass at 70,
become a late-life alcoholic.

58
00:04:57,112 --> 00:05:00,283
Thought I'd get a jump
on it.

59
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:02,748
Hey, is Paulie coming?

60
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,017
Yeah, apparently.

61
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:05,618
Fuck, now they
decide to make up.

62
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,685
Oh, be nice.

63
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,753
I am nice, I'm always nice.

64
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:08,924
I'm here, aren't I?

65
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,759
Um, I gave you a 50.

66
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,594
No, it was a 20.

67
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:15,665
Cool.

68
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:18,397
Okay you keep the change.

69
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:22,572
All righty, so when do
we board the fun bus?

70
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:28,944
Are you kidding me?

71
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:40,990

Hey, oh me too!

78

Oh my god it fell all out.

79
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:03,077
Sorry, I can
taste my teeth.

80
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,312
Mmm, it's airplane pretzels
and house red,

81
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:07,546
and the recycled air, and the
breathing other people's farts

82

for four hours.

83
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:09,983
Haha, for JFK?

84
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:11,685
Yeah, two on the
runway, two in the air.

85
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:12,985
It wasn't that bad.

86
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:14,253
Oh, you were
in first class.

87
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:15,320
Well, people fart
in first class.

88
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:16,490
So how are you?

89
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,558
Oh, it's been like
a really long time.

90
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,659
Your wedding.

91
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:21,094
No.

92
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:22,562
No, no, there was that
winter in New York.

93
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:23,663
Oh god, that was like...

94
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:24,930
Years... ago.

95
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:26,433
I know, I know.

96
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:27,834
And I've been meaning to...
and you have kids now,

97
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:29,668
oh my god, so cute.

98
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,404
You post all those
great pictures.

99
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:32,572
Yeah, thanks.

100
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:34,640
And thank you for the flowers.

101
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:38,647
It's too bad you couldn't
make it to either baby shower.

102
00:06:39,814 --> 00:06:42,848
It was like, impossible
to leave town

103
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,385
with like life stuff and
work, it's been insane.

104
00:06:45,387 --> 00:06:47,122
For the last six years?

105
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:50,858
I'll have a white wine.

106
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:54,527
So, suburban life, how's that?

107
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,329
Very good, we're managing.

108
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,932
Managing, sounds promising.

109
00:06:58,934 --> 00:06:59,798
How's your man Chad?

110
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,632
-Brad.

111
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:01,702
Brad.

112
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:03,269
So what is it like, uh,

113
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:06,005
the playdate soccer
practices, dinners at six?

114
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:07,373
Actually I enjoy it.

115
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,043
It's the most important
job I've ever had.

116
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:12,245
Good, 'cause
nothing's as important

117
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:14,113
like a four bedroom
Tudor in Connecticut.

118
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:16,183
Better than herpes on
a Grateful Dead poncho.

119
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,552
♪ Anyway ♪

120
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:20,486
That poncho was handcrafted
in the fucking Appalachians.

121
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:23,223
So, how's the job, Elaine?

122
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,925
Oh, be awesome if I
don't wanna kill myself

123
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,325
by 9:15 in the morning.

124
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:27,560
And I didn't
give you herpes.

125
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:28,461
Well somebody did.

126
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:29,865
And, cut!

127
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,332
Sylvia, hi.

128
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:35,769
I'm just kidding,
the lighting was terrible.

129
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:39,072
Oh, you poor thing,
I am so sorry.

130
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:41,173
Oh, and I did not mean
that thing I just said.

131
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:42,442
I'm so sorry about Max.

132
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:44,713
But I remember
that poncho.

133
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:47,046
Oh god, uh.

134
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:48,615
Once a filmmaker,
always a filmmaker, huh?

135
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:50,050
Oh yeah, I guess so.

136
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,584
Sorry, can you
delete that?

137
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,786
How does that, like work?

138
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:55,055
I mean it's not exactly L.A.

139
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,623
- Larry.
- at least the herpes part...

140
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,257
- I don't actually have...
- No, it's not, is it?

141
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,060
But I just, you know,
I still like to dabble.

142
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:01,894
...I mean it's not contagious.

143
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:03,796
That'll
be eight dollars.

144
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:05,231
Sorry.

145
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,132
My country's overrun
with psychotherapists

146
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:11,236
and Max, you know, he
liked academic life.

147
00:08:11,238 --> 00:08:12,938
He was the breadwinner, so.

148
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,875
Oh please, I think we'd
all love to get away,

149
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:17,379
move to Iowa, or...

150
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,812
Wisconsin.

151
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:19,978
Or Wisconsin.

152
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,649
30 miles from nowhere.

153
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:25,051
Exactly, I mean if
I never saw another

154
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:27,620
six-inch cockroach
in the subway.

155
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:29,923
Oh, no cockroaches here.

156
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,192
The cold kills them.

157
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:36,094
And it's so civilized and quiet.

158
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:38,033
Just you and the great outdoors.

159
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:42,704
Well,
it certainly is now.

160
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:47,040
Sylvia, I'm so sorry
about Max, it's just...

161
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:47,940
Awful.

162
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:48,874
Terrible.

163
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:49,944
It's so sad.

164
00:08:50,144 --> 00:08:51,544
Do you want a drink?

165
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:53,949
Oh, no, no, no, I
can't, I can't really.

166
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:55,983
So what happened?

167
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:58,852
Unless you don't...
I mean, if it's private...

168
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,987
We should probably get
Paul and head north

169
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:02,291
before it gets dark.

170
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:03,757
Sure.

171
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,992
Oh. Wait, what about Jack?

172
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:06,892
Oh, they missed their flight.

173
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,462
They?

174
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,433
His girlfriend Amber,
apparently she's coming too.

175
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:12,801
Sweet.

176
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:27,980
Yo!

177
00:09:27,982 --> 00:09:30,249
Smally Pauly!

178
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:32,354
Hi!

179
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:34,621
Get over here!

180
00:09:34,623 --> 00:09:35,521
I...

181
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:36,355
Your bag.

182
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:37,225
Uh, yeah.

183
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:39,961
I'm just...

184
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:44,966
Hi.

185
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,098
You look great, Paul.

186
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,533
Oh, totally, dude.

187
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:50,502
Starving social worker
thing looks good on you.

188
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:51,573
Larry.

189
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:53,973
What, I'm saying, fancy
dinners make you fucking fat.

190
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:55,142
You look awesome.

191
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,444
So, how's the practice?

192
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:00,115
Oh yeah, reporting
live, shrink good.

193
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:02,748
No, no, that was
a slow news day.

194
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,050
Max would have killed
for a story like that.

195
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:06,518
It was about the center, not me.

196
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,387
You're still a big
deal though, huh?

197
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:09,622
Well no.

198
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:11,590
Yeah, yeah if it's on
NPR it's a big deal.

199
00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:14,262
Trust me I had to hear
enough about it to know.

200
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,743
...but sometimes,
these studies have

201
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:32,545
unintended consequences.

202
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:35,983
There are casualties,
psychologically speaking.

203
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,249
Well I don't get
it, why would anyone...

204
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:38,350
This was a dedicated student

205
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:40,152
wanting to please a professor.

206
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:42,022
Even stayed at the
house for a time.

207
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:44,190
Jesus, sounds like
a fucking prisoner.

208
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:46,161
Oh, no.

209
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:47,627
No, no.

210
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:50,595
It was just images that
might be disturbing

211
00:10:50,597 --> 00:10:52,799
to people with
certain constitutions.

212
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:53,867
But nothing tactile.

213
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:55,435
So what happened?

214
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:58,838
Well I mean he failed,
pathologically speaking.

215
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,906
Did he quit?

216
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:01,174
He disappeared.

217
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:03,410
And I mean just gone
without a trace.

218
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,511
The university opened
an investigation

219
00:11:05,513 --> 00:11:08,013
so they canceled
all Max's classes,

220
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,781
his grants dried up overnight.

221
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:12,184
I mean as you know,
Paul, an incomplete study

222
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:13,719
is a useless one.

223
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:14,853
Whoah.

224
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:15,854
Whoah!

225
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:17,556
Oh my god.

226
00:11:17,558 --> 00:11:18,223
What was that?

227
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:19,158
Should we stop?

228
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,594
No, gross, no.

229
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,395
We got a lot of
stray dogs out here.

230
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:24,030
I'm sorry, I'm not good with...

231
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:25,398
Blood, yeah we know.

232
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,666
With the economy,
people just

233
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:28,003
stopped caring for them.

234
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:31,371
But they do what they
have to do to survive...

235
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:32,272
-So sad.

236
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,475
...until they don't.

237
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:36,642
Okay, so how did Max
do it, did you say?

238
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:38,243
- Larry.
- Dude, come on.

239
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:40,879
A 1911 Colt 45.

240
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:43,550
I mean, I don't know from guns,

241
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:46,288
but that's what
the police told me.

242
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:49,289
I'm so sorry, Sylvia.

243
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,823
I'm glad we could be here.

244
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:52,224
We all are.

245
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:54,762
Those college years
meant the world to Max.

246
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,466
You guys, the McHale Hall Crew.

247
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,602
It was the closest he
ever got to family.

248
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:06,039
I think he always
knew that you guys

249
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,475
would be there in the end.

250
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:41,074
I can't believe it.

251
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:43,209
It looks exactly the same.

252
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:44,546
Ah, the memories.

253
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:46,278
This is very <i>Big Chill.</i>

254
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,546
Please, those people
were like a hundred.

255
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,215
Ooh, we're
like a hundred.

256
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:50,784
And didn't they all
sleep together?

257
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:52,285
Did they?

258
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:53,953
I don't know, I'm assuming.

259
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:55,222
Don't they always?

260
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:56,623
Don't forget to
sign the guestbook.

261
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,059
Even in death, Max would
wanna know who was here.

262
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:01,196
He was always a
stickler for detail.

263
00:13:01,763 --> 00:13:04,600
He's not asking for
a fucking cheek swab.

264
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,502
Anyhoo, I put you
all in the loft.

265
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:11,637
Paul and Larry can
take the twins.

266
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,239
Bess, you and Elaine
can share the queen,

267
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:15,742
you're good friends.

268
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:17,477
And I put Jack and his
girlfriend in the back bedroom.

269
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:18,980
Pssh, per usual.

270
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,748
Max's mother and I will
be in the main house

271
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,949
if you need anything.

272
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:24,383
Oh, I didn't know
Norma was living here.

273
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:25,852
She's been staying
here year-round

274
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:27,453
for the last few months now.

275
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:29,525
She was having some...

276
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:35,127
confusion, and Max
was always fascinated

277
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:36,561
by the aging process,

278
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:41,370
so she's here but her
mental state is not.

279
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:43,136
Oh wow.

280
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:45,139
But you don't turn
away family, so.

281
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:49,007
Paul, your father,
didn't he have...

282
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:50,611
Yeah, it's not easy.

283
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:04,225
Amazing what strain
does to the human brain.

284
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:08,895
So, uh,
the kitchen's the same.

285
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:10,563
We're still on well water.

286
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:13,766
The filtration system is
not what it used to be

287
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:16,502
so you might catch
a little sediment.

288
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:20,305
It has its own flavor but
it's drinkable, and oh!

289
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:21,342
- Oh!
- Ugh.

290
00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:24,145
Oh, for goodness sake.

291
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:30,885
Maisy!

292
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:36,258
Maisy, get in here!

293
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:38,594
Oh, that cat.

294
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:48,001
Max used to work out
here in the guesthouse.

295
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:51,271
Maisy would bring him a
dead rat every morning.

296
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:52,774
Guess she misses him too.

297
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:55,842
Well anyhoo, it's
one less rat for you

298
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,410
to have to worry about.

299
00:14:57,412 --> 00:15:00,646
Okay, so the cellphones,
they don't work up here.

300
00:15:00,648 --> 00:15:02,381
You'll have to use the landline

301
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:04,717
if you wanna make outside calls.

302
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:08,353
I left some menus in case
you want to order food.

303
00:15:08,355 --> 00:15:09,555
There are only two
or three places

304
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:11,190
that will deliver this far out

305
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:14,694
so I would say Top Ling's
Chinese is the best of them.

306
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,561
Ooh, I'd kill for a pork bun.

307
00:15:16,563 --> 00:15:18,432
I remember.

308
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:21,968
Just stay away from
Caldova Lucha.

309
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,401
We're so hard to find

310
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:25,972
and all they have are
these kids driving.

311
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:28,373
Half of them never even make it.

312
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,008
God forbid we had
a real emergency.

313
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,846
We'd be decomposing by the
time the cops got here.

314
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:40,389
Thank you...

315
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,488
All of you, for coming.

316
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,326
It means the world to us.

317
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:54,334
Wow, she perked
right the fuck up.

318
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,536
I'm exhausted, no
wonder he offed himself.

319
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,036
She's lonely.

320
00:15:58,038 --> 00:15:59,939
She probably hasn't talked
to anyone in months.

321
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:01,708
Weren't they gonna get a
divorce 10 years ago?

322
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,743
They got married 10 years ago.

323
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:04,977
Exactly.

324
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:06,912
Guys, can we focus on
food, I'm starving.

325
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:09,515
Wow, does Chinese food in
Wisconsin <i>not</i> sound good?

326
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:12,584
There's Indian
here too and Thai.

327
00:16:12,586 --> 00:16:14,422
It's the midwest, shouldn't
there be cheeseburgers?

328
00:16:14,688 --> 00:16:15,821
Well, they probably
don't deliver

329
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:17,355
to the middle of
fucking nowhere.

330
00:16:17,357 --> 00:16:18,723
Oh, come on, you loved it here.

331
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:21,728
You were the slut
of Chez Lehman.

332
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,897
Was I?

333
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,866
It was like
hunting season, man.

334
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:28,300
Everyone's date was fair game.

335
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:29,634
Grouch much?

336
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:31,170
I'm just saying I
always drove home

337
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:33,573
with a full pack of condoms
and an awkward car trip

338
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,640
to look forward to.

339
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:38,076
Well dude, you can't spend
four nights in the woods

340
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,214
and spend three of them with
chicks crying on your shoulder.

341
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:43,584
No one wants to have sex with
their fucking teddy bear.

342
00:16:44,051 --> 00:16:45,550
Yeah, okay.

343
00:16:45,552 --> 00:16:47,353
So, dumplings?

344
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:48,186
Yes ma'am.

345
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:49,122
Yes.

346
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:50,457
Okay, if I have to.

347
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:56,295
Uh, not a word.

348
00:16:56,297 --> 00:16:57,331
Wait, wait,
wait, hold on.

349
00:16:58,131 --> 00:16:59,198
Not a word.

350
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,166
Sure it is.

351
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:01,699
- Meaning?
- Bruns.

352
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,603
I don't know what it means,
but I know it's a word.

353
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,737
We'll never
know, will we?

354
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:06,373
Not without wifi, we won't.

355
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,408
How does a guy with
a PhD not have a dictionary?

356
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,676
Language of the mind.

357
00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:12,077
Words are superfluous.

358
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,613
As are ethics, apparently.

359
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,950
There, there it is.

360
00:17:15,982 --> 00:17:17,018
Did you hear that?

361
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:18,750
No.

362
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:20,853
Like a buzzing, I
keep hearing this hum.

363
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:23,323
Scientists are
always misunderstood.

364
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:24,489
Like Mengele.

365
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:25,624
I don't hear anything.

366
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:26,926
It's gone now.

367
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:28,628
You seriously equating
Max with a Nazi?

368
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,028
Well, why do you have the
right to torment people

369
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,764
just because you have a
degree and some funding?

370
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:33,032
They weren't tormenting people,

371
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:34,499
they vet these
studies, you can't do...

372
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:35,468
Do they thought?

373
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,538
There!

374
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,307
Where'd it go?

375
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:43,642
You know, just because you
work with the unwashed masses

376
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:46,179
doesn't mean that all
shrinks are saints.

377
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:47,747
Did I say that we were?

378
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:49,347
Nothing like paying a guy
like 200 dollars an hour

379
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:50,783
to tell you your life sucks.

380
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:52,854
Now you're a sad
sack and a sucker.

381
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:55,054
You would make a
terrible patient.

382
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:56,422
Damn right.

383
00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:57,790
I don't need some
dick in a turtleneck

384
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,292
to tell me how to
process my feelings.

385
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:01,192
I don't think people
wear turtlenecks anymore.

386
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:02,495
No?

387
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:03,728
Max isn't a dick,
he's a scientist

388
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,030
and he is your friend.

389
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:06,665
<i>Was,</i> Paul, he was a scientist.

390
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:07,799
None of us have
seen him in years.

391
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,403
Who knows what he is now?

392
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:11,673
Dead.

393
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:14,875
He's dead now.

394
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:18,645
Okay, whatever.

395
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,480
This kid knew what he
was getting himself into,

396
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:24,249
otherwise he shouldn't have
signed on the dotted line.

397
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:26,051
What, what was he like, 18?

398
00:18:26,053 --> 00:18:27,519
Think of us at 18.

399
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:28,756
<i>Caveat emptor.</i>

400
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:31,960
Crazy always finds its way out.

401
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:37,798
Who's ready to party?!

402
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:39,100
What is up?

403
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:42,969
Hey Jack.

404
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:44,603
Oh, baby girl!

405
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:46,505
There he is!

406
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:47,774
Hey buddy.

407
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,911
Good to see you, buddy.

408
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:54,380
Yo, man, how you been?
It's been a long time!

409
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:56,915
Yeah it's been a
while, I'm good.

410
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:57,718
Yeah, all right.

411
00:18:58,318 --> 00:19:00,085
Hey, let me help with those.

412
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:02,188
So you're a model,
is that right?

413
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,055
Give up the dream, Larry!

414
00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:06,728
Once you go Jack,
you never go back.

415
00:19:06,994 --> 00:19:09,897
You got me, I'm a dreamer.

416
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:11,831
You don't change, man.

417
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,400
Oh thank god, someone
brought booze.

418
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:16,035
So this is...?

419
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:16,768
Oh, Amber.

420
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,337
Amber this is everyone.

421
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:20,940
- Hey.
- Hello.

422
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:24,679
So, who's ready to
grieve into a 2008 Pinot?

423
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:27,479
Lucky for you, we went shopping.

424
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:29,817
We got spray cheese.

425
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:32,586
Beef jerky.

426
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,490
Glow
in the dark condoms.

427
00:19:36,857 --> 00:19:39,158
So come on, fill me in!

428
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,897
Do we know why this
fucker offed himself?

429
00:19:58,045 --> 00:20:00,145
Yeah, he didn't talk to
me for like two weeks

430
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:03,682
because I wouldn't fill out
that dumbass sex survey.

431
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:07,754
Oh god the sex survey.

432
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:10,989
Am I the only one
who filled that out?

433
00:20:12,326 --> 00:20:13,327
You sucker!

434
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:16,528
He was like Houdini, man,
he got you every time.

435
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,229
Because it was
flattering though,

436
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:20,132
I mean I think we all want to
be the subject of something.

437
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:22,200
The quickest way to get
your ass broken up with

438
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:24,636
is to be honest about
your sex habits.

439
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:26,071
Cause and effect, man.

440
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:28,674
We get dumped because
of his shitty survey

441
00:20:28,676 --> 00:20:30,776
and then he gets his
pick of our exes?

442
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:32,277
Yeah, pick exes!

443
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:34,548
Oh he would have loved you.

444
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:37,082
Absolutely, totally.

445
00:20:38,286 --> 00:20:39,120
Dude.

446
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,386
But what, no, whatever,

447
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:42,821
that was, it was a psych study.

448
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:44,824
That wasn't like a sex plot.

449
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,160
Well, you two had your
level of shit going on.

450
00:20:49,364 --> 00:20:51,163
It was college man,
it was competitive.

451
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:53,967
Yeah, then you had to
rat him out to the IRB

452
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:56,035
for quoting a fucking
science journal.

453
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,902
It was a little more
than just a quote.

454
00:20:57,904 --> 00:20:58,970
Well it's none of your business

455
00:20:58,972 --> 00:21:00,573
is what it was, Mr. Rogers.

456
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:01,539
Or was it?

457
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,409
Guys, shut up.

458
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,447
Got you the grant
though, didn't it?

459
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:09,748
Yeah, it did, because
you don't get funding

460
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,982
unless you have numbers.

461
00:21:10,984 --> 00:21:13,251
Right, which you're
not gonna have

462
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:14,819
if all your friends
are ratting you out.

463
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:16,488
Oh Larry, come on.

464
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,390
I apologized, okay?

465
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:19,926
I'm still apologizing.

466
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:22,061
Hey, you don't have to
apologize to me, man.

467
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:24,596
Pickaxe for a pickin' ass!

468
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:29,835
Oh yes.

469
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:32,604
Shirt down, babe, we
can see your tits!

470
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:33,838
Thank you for that.

471
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,309
Do you need help with those?

472
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:37,478
- Oh, I do.
- Yo!

473
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:42,014
Okay, the only way that

474
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,816
having sex with a stranger
does not count as cheating

475
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:47,719
is if you're a hooker.

476
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:50,222
Then it's like
your nine to five.

477
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:56,965
Holy shit,
what the hell is that?

478
00:21:58,398 --> 00:22:00,334
Whoah, whoah, whoah,
where you going, dude?

479
00:22:02,636 --> 00:22:03,602
It's a woman.

480
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:04,670
It's a ghost.

481
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:05,906
Why is he talking to it?

482
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:10,642
- Holy shit!
- What the hell?

483
00:22:11,878 --> 00:22:13,379
Oh my god,
is that a wolf?

484
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:15,948
Get out of here!

485
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,385
Go on, shoo!

486
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:20,620
Do you have dogs?

487
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:22,654
No, she's just an alpha.

488
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:23,991
I can also be beta.

489
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,892
Oh, I totally have
the shakes, dudes.

490
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:29,228
Oh, shit like detox shakes?

491
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,997
'cause I think I
killed the bottle.

492
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:32,264
How many does that make?

493
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:33,565
Oh don't judge.

494
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:34,665
I'm the only one here with
no hope of getting laid.

495
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,067
Hello, married.

496
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:38,403
I don't think pork
buns is getting laid.

497
00:22:38,405 --> 00:22:42,109
It's a funeral, you really
wanna get laid at a funeral?

498
00:22:46,146 --> 00:22:47,147
That was Norma.

499
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,951
She said she was
looking for Max.

500
00:22:50,852 --> 00:22:53,017
She didn't even recognize me.

501
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:55,554
Oh, what was in those pork buns?

502
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:57,288
Bartendo, what have we got?

503
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:02,296
Ah, whiskey, two
lights and a zinfandel.

504
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,765
Larry?

505
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:06,565
Top Ling just tried to kill me.

506
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:10,835
I want red, white,
and a little bit of Jack.

507
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:12,371
Oh you want a
little bit of Jack?

508
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:13,372
You want a bit of Jack?

509
00:23:13,374 --> 00:23:14,373
Come here.

510
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:29,890
Oh shit!

511
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:39,901
What the fuck?

512
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:43,672
What the...?

513
00:23:50,377 --> 00:23:51,245
Oh fuck.

514
00:23:55,482 --> 00:23:56,882
Whoah, you all right?

515
00:23:56,884 --> 00:23:58,284
Yeah fine, fine.

516
00:23:58,286 --> 00:23:59,884
I'm just getting used
to the well water.

517
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:02,153
Oh yeah, it's like
an egg being filtered

518
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:03,588
through a fucking diaper.

519
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,690
Yeah, hey, was anyone in
the basement just now?

520
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:09,294
Uh, not unless that kid
came back for his dignity.

521
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:10,796
Larry.

522
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:11,965
Bessie.

523
00:24:15,502 --> 00:24:17,004
What's up, you're tense.

524
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,572
Yeah, I wonder why.

525
00:24:20,574 --> 00:24:23,144
Yeah, dead friend.

526
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:26,911
Are you missing
the little people?

527
00:24:26,913 --> 00:24:28,380
The rocky marriage?

528
00:24:28,382 --> 00:24:29,248
What?

529
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,282
Oh please.

530
00:24:30,284 --> 00:24:31,482
We're managing?

531
00:24:31,484 --> 00:24:34,253
I mean, I know a sinking
ship when I see one.

532
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:36,891
Believe me, I've
sunk two of them.

533
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,458
Karen, oh, really?

534
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,992
Yeah, it's all over
but the signing.

535
00:24:40,994 --> 00:24:44,263
Oh Larry, I'm
sorry, that's awful.

536
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:45,100
Yeah.

537
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,001
It's not so bad.

538
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,774
Off, what do you say we
revisit the summer of '05?

539
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:57,377
You have puke breath.

540
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:00,781
Goddammit.

541
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:15,460
Oh my god!

542
00:25:15,462 --> 00:25:16,629
What happened?!

543
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:18,529
Oh my god, there's
somebody out there.

544
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:19,399
Oh my god.

545
00:25:22,036 --> 00:25:23,971
He was on the balcony.

546
00:25:26,207 --> 00:25:29,775
He was there up against
the glass like a vampire.

547
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:30,842
A hot one?

548
00:25:30,844 --> 00:25:32,044
What?

549
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:34,313
Babe, you're tired.

550
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:37,015
No, there's somebody out there!

551
00:25:37,017 --> 00:25:37,917
Did you see a ladder?

552
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,384
No.

553
00:25:39,386 --> 00:25:41,990
Did you see wings?

554
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,458
Oh my god, fuck you!

555
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:48,462
'Cause you know last time I
checked, man couldn't fly.

556
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:06,411
I can't believe I
forgot she does this.

557
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:08,817
We used to call
it pulling a Cho.

558
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:14,319
Well, I mean we could just
like adjust her, right?

559
00:26:14,321 --> 00:26:16,388
Please, I've lifted her off
the bathroom floor before.

560
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,226
She's like a concrete slab.

561
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:21,259
Okay well, I'll sleep with her,

562
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:23,230
and you can push the
twins together.

563
00:26:24,498 --> 00:26:26,898
After 20
years of wussing out,

564
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,267
now you're gonna make your move?

565
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:31,636
I will leave my clothes on.

566
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:33,838
Of course you will.

567
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,806
No, no, we'll take the twins.

568
00:26:35,808 --> 00:26:36,944
Like old times.

569
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,547
Why are we always the
ones stuck in the balcony

570
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:44,482
while everyone else
played the sick card

571
00:26:44,484 --> 00:26:48,653
or fucked their faces off
in the actual bedroom?

572
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:50,221
Yeah, that sounds familiar.

573
00:26:50,223 --> 00:26:52,090
I mean I didn't really
have any options, but you...

574
00:26:52,092 --> 00:26:54,961
No, I was surrounded by wolves.

575
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:58,063
Well the pack leader
ain't getting any tonight,

576
00:26:58,065 --> 00:27:00,168
not after those pork buns.

577
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:08,009
This room used to be dark.

578
00:27:08,942 --> 00:27:10,677
Seems exactly the same.

579
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:13,277
Just a little older.

580
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,345
A little drunker.

581
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:15,884
And without all the baggage.

582
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:21,389
Yeah right.

583
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:27,261
Good night.

584
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:30,497
Good night, E.

585
00:27:31,832 --> 00:27:33,899
Can you tell me a story?

586
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:35,100
-No.

587
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:36,704
Come on, a short story.

588
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:38,871
Sleeping time.

589
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:41,042
- That's my face.
- I know.

590
00:28:30,357 --> 00:28:31,190
Morning!

591
00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:32,425
Hope you slept okay.

592
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:34,793
Oh yeah... hi!

593
00:28:34,795 --> 00:28:35,893
What time is it?

594
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:37,030
Breakfast time.

595
00:28:37,964 --> 00:28:40,465
Oh Sylvia, we should
be taking care of <i>you.</i>

596
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:43,668
Oh, no, no, don't be silly,

597
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,170
you're my guests.

598
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:46,774
Who is it?

599
00:28:47,307 --> 00:28:48,707
Just thought you might
need a little something

600
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:50,042
to soak up the booze.

601
00:28:50,044 --> 00:28:53,112
Oh no, I'm so
sorry, were we loud?

602
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:57,516
No, no, I just figured
old college crowd.

603
00:28:57,518 --> 00:29:00,286
Max always said you
guys were a little wild.

604
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,121
Oh you should have joined us.

605
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:04,189
No, no, I
don't drink anymore.

606
00:29:04,191 --> 00:29:05,259
Oh god.

607
00:29:11,064 --> 00:29:12,663
Babe?

608
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:13,533
You okay?

609
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:18,103
So I picked these up in town.

610
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:19,371
People are closing down early,

611
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:21,873
what with the weather coming in.

612
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:24,176
Is it supposed to rain?

613
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:29,349
Rain, hail, maybe a
tornado if we're lucky.

614
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,219
We call it flood season.

615
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:36,254
Sometimes it's best to
just lock up and sit tight.

616
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:40,892
Oh wow, I'm sure, so...

617
00:29:40,894 --> 00:29:44,031
Of course the dead don't
wait on the rain, do they?

618
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:50,770
I'll be back in a bit to
pick you up for the service.

619
00:29:51,238 --> 00:29:52,774
Ow.

620
00:30:10,457 --> 00:30:12,460
That is so loud.

621
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,994
I don't think it's
ever even worked.

622
00:30:15,996 --> 00:30:18,699
There's probably produce
from 1998 down there.

623
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,632
Oh, wow.

624
00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:23,636
Who throws up in
the kitchen sink?

625
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:26,771
Says the man who spent half
the night in the bathroom.

626
00:30:26,773 --> 00:30:28,006
How dare you.

627
00:30:28,008 --> 00:30:29,874
I was poisoned by pork buns.

628
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:35,081
That woman was poisoned by
wine and youth and stupidity.

629
00:30:35,282 --> 00:30:37,615
Ah, she was nervous, she's 23.

630
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:38,984
Pretty sure I was
waking up in a pool

631
00:30:38,986 --> 00:30:41,019
of my own vomit at 23.

632
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:42,421
I remember, you were.

633
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,525
Now I have the tolerance
of an Irish seaman.

634
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:48,293
Vomit aside, I was
thinking I might tap that.

635
00:30:48,295 --> 00:30:49,428
Oh Larry.

636
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,929
I am kidding.

637
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:52,597
You've been stealing
girlfriends for 20 years.

638
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,167
Give someone else a chance.

639
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:56,170
Who?

640
00:30:57,003 --> 00:30:58,469
Fuck me.

641
00:30:58,471 --> 00:31:00,540
I guess the storm's coming in.

642
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:13,187
That's better.

643
00:31:14,855 --> 00:31:15,690
That's nice.

644
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:22,494
Hi!

645
00:31:22,496 --> 00:31:25,663
Hi, sorry, sorry, did I, sorry.

646
00:31:25,665 --> 00:31:27,999
I thought I'd bring
aspirin and some water,

647
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:31,336
a little hair of the dog,
if you're so inclined.

648
00:31:31,338 --> 00:31:34,038
Oh yes, doggy needs some hair.

649
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,243
Okay here you go.

650
00:31:42,215 --> 00:31:43,815
Do you want
the aspirin bit, too?

651
00:31:43,817 --> 00:31:44,652
-Oh yeah.

652
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,987
Was it bad?

653
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:50,423
Which part?

654
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,695
I kind of threw up a little bit.

655
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:57,764
Oh my god, you did?

656
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,565
Okay, in the sink, yeah.

657
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,767
It's better than in the fridge.

658
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:03,901
I guess, yeah.

659
00:32:03,903 --> 00:32:05,770
Besides you made
Larry feel better.

660
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:08,373
He thinks we forgot he was
shitting pork buns all night.

661
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:10,842
I just, I don't
usually drink whiskey.

662
00:32:10,844 --> 00:32:13,978
I'm more of a pink
wine kind of girl.

663
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,515
Well, desperate times.

664
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,250
Oh my god,
do I seem desperate?

665
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:20,885
No, no, no, it's a quote.

666
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:22,754
Oh my god, 'cause I usually
drink when I get nervous.

667
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:24,855
And then I saw that
thing in the window.

668
00:32:24,857 --> 00:32:26,292
-I get it.

669
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:29,630
It's kind of hard to be the
newbie among crazy people.

670
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:34,599
Jack gets really annoyed.

671
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:37,738
Please, he's lucky to have you.

672
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:41,875
At least I kept my
clothes on, right?

673
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:45,278
Oh my god, he's gonna kill me.

674
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:47,144
No, it was nothing.

675
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:48,446
I mean you flashed us.

676
00:32:48,448 --> 00:32:49,715
-Oh that's so embarrassing.

677
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,283
But it was super
fast, like too fast.

678
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:55,389
And no, it's not, because
you have... a great rack.

679
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:57,756
Really?

680
00:32:57,758 --> 00:32:58,625
Totally.

681
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,760
Thank you.

682
00:33:01,428 --> 00:33:02,896
You're welcome.

683
00:33:03,864 --> 00:33:08,236
Maybe you should get drunk
and nervous more often.

684
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

685
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:13,097
What the hell?

686
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:14,233
Jack, what are you doing?

687
00:34:14,235 --> 00:34:15,400
I thought you might need help.

688
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:16,737
No, I'm good.

689
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:21,240
Baby, I know you're having
trouble reaching your back.

690
00:34:21,242 --> 00:34:22,843
Knock it off, give me a towel.

691
00:34:23,777 --> 00:34:26,480
Hey, summer of '02,
what do you say?

692
00:34:26,914 --> 00:34:30,115
Jack, it's his
funeral, I'm not gonna...

693
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:31,249
What, cheat on him again?

694
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:32,119
Yeah.

695
00:34:32,385 --> 00:34:33,784
Come on, babe.

696
00:34:33,786 --> 00:34:35,787
There's a statute of
limitations on all that.

697
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:37,891
Especially when the
injured party is dead.

698
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,994
You have a girlfriend
in the other room.

699
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:42,927
So?

700
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:45,597
So, she was vomiting,
maybe you should go and...

701
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,934
We could go canoeing.

702
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:50,202
Maybe you should
go check on her.

703
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:52,506
I won't tell Max if you don't.

704
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:27,742
Mmm, that feels good.

705
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:29,909
Mm, totally.

706
00:35:30,577 --> 00:35:31,645
Who knew?

707
00:35:32,612 --> 00:35:35,148
As a kid, I used to love
having my arm tickled.

708
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:38,652
But the neck feels good too.

709
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,262
What the hell, what happened?

710
00:35:51,264 --> 00:35:52,329
Cockroaches!

711
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:53,731
There were fucking cockroaches!

712
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:55,200
Oh my god, there was
like thousands of them,

713
00:35:55,202 --> 00:35:56,170
they're everywhere!

714
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:57,501
They're bugs, Amber.

715
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,269
I know they're bugs, Jack.

716
00:35:59,271 --> 00:36:00,572
Why are you wet?

717
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:01,873
What's up,
what's going on?

718
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:02,974
There are cockroaches
in the bed!

719
00:36:02,976 --> 00:36:03,708
What?

720
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,110
In our bed, ugh!

721
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:06,376
That's disgusting, I
thought there weren't...

722
00:36:06,378 --> 00:36:07,845
No, it's a lie.

723
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:09,414
Cockroaches do not
die in Wisconsin.

724
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:11,282
They come inside to get
warm in your fucking seat.

725
00:36:11,284 --> 00:36:13,219
Oh god I feel like
there's one in my mouth.

726
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:14,619
Wait, there was a cockroach?

727
00:36:14,621 --> 00:36:16,054
Not a cockroach, Paul!

728
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:17,287
Like 60 of them!

729
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:18,188
And they were...

730
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,289
On you, we get it.

731
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,224
Just calm down, so we can...

732
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:22,293
Get out of here?

733
00:36:22,295 --> 00:36:23,728
We're not going anywhere, babe.

734
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,496
We got a funeral to go to.

735
00:36:25,498 --> 00:36:26,630
I didn't know him.

736
00:36:26,632 --> 00:36:28,066
I'm not going.

737
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:30,969
In the woods, they're bugs.

738
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:32,970
Maybe the wind just
blew something open.

739
00:36:32,972 --> 00:36:34,371
Like your pants?

740
00:36:34,373 --> 00:36:35,576
Shit.

741
00:36:41,914 --> 00:36:43,347
It's like the end of
the world out there.

742
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:45,516
Nope, just
Wisconsin in October.

743
00:36:45,518 --> 00:36:47,020
Jesus, she's like a ninja.

744
00:36:47,887 --> 00:36:50,591
Okay, time to say our goodbyes.

745
00:36:57,664 --> 00:36:59,664
We are here to
celebrate the life

746
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:01,934
of Maxwell Lehman,

747
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:05,840
who now returns to his home
with our God, the Father.

748
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,344
With each flower, we give
our love, our hearts,

749
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:15,347
our commitment to
cherish your memory.

750
00:37:16,215 --> 00:37:19,752
May you find more peace
among God's angels

751
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:27,628
and may your tortured soul
find solace in the afterlife.

752
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:29,827
Here you go.

753
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:30,994
Thanks, I'll...

754
00:37:30,996 --> 00:37:32,331
- No, for the coffin.
- Sure.

755
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,331
No, that's okay, that's okay.

756
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,967
I didn't really know him.

757
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:38,771
No, any friends of Jack's
is a friend of Max, please.

758
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:50,518
Um.

759
00:37:51,851 --> 00:37:53,985
These guys really miss you,

760
00:37:53,987 --> 00:37:56,923
and, uh, wherever you are...

761
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

762
00:38:08,802 --> 00:38:10,004
Oh my god!

763
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:12,673
Grab my hand!

764
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:15,505
Grab my hand, give me your hand!

765
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:16,576
Amber!

766
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:36,896
Well, it was a
very nice service,

767
00:38:38,264 --> 00:38:41,432
- all things considered.
- Short and sweet.

768
00:38:41,434 --> 00:38:43,901
Max was never one for sentiment.

769
00:38:43,903 --> 00:38:46,637
I just wish that his
colleagues had come,

770
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,342
you know, show a little remorse.

771
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:54,378
Scientist can be so cold-hearted
when they want to be.

772
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,249
I remember.

773
00:38:56,382 --> 00:38:58,619
Milk-livered man.

774
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:02,253
Thou bear'st a cheek for
blows, a head for wrongs.

775
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:03,121
-Norma, please.

776
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:04,625
Pluck out his eyes!

777
00:39:05,492 --> 00:39:07,825
She thinks that she's
back in Pittsburgh,

778
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:08,726
doing some kind of...

779
00:39:08,728 --> 00:39:09,797
King Lear.

780
00:39:11,231 --> 00:39:13,267
We did it in my
cold reading class.

781
00:39:14,534 --> 00:39:17,003
Madness can be so unforgiving.

782
00:39:18,304 --> 00:39:21,673
You just gotta hope it's
not genetic, right Paul?

783
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:22,740
I'm sorry?

784
00:39:22,742 --> 00:39:24,945
Your dad, with his early onset.

785
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:28,081
Mmm.

786
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:31,952
Stink... shit.

787
00:39:33,353 --> 00:39:34,385
Eggs!

788
00:39:34,387 --> 00:39:35,788
See it can happen so fast.

789
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,555
Max!

790
00:39:38,557 --> 00:39:40,293
Max is dead, Norma.

791
00:39:41,393 --> 00:39:42,261
He's dead.

792
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:49,066
She gets this way, I'm sorry.

793
00:39:49,068 --> 00:39:49,934
No, no.

794
00:39:49,936 --> 00:39:51,771
I think it's time for us to go.

795
00:39:58,311 --> 00:40:00,948
So what the hell is that
about your dad, dude?

796
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:03,380
Doesn't matter.

797
00:40:03,382 --> 00:40:04,449
Oh, come on.

798
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:05,885
I thought it was shitty.

799
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,155
People grieve in
different ways, you know.

800
00:40:10,322 --> 00:40:12,523
When my dog Sparky died,
I got drunk for a week

801
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:14,394
and I went skeet shooting.

802
00:40:16,596 --> 00:40:19,065
I've never gone skeet
shooting a day in my life.

803
00:40:20,132 --> 00:40:22,168
Death does strange
things to people.

804
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:26,206
Fuck!

805
00:40:26,472 --> 00:40:28,139
Why is it freezing in here?

806
00:40:28,141 --> 00:40:30,340
Where is the fucking firewood?

807
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:31,575
Out there.

808
00:40:31,577 --> 00:40:32,946
Oh, no thank you.

809
00:40:34,347 --> 00:40:35,679
I'll go.

810
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:36,683
I'll go.

811
00:40:37,884 --> 00:40:38,950
What?

812
00:40:38,952 --> 00:40:40,083
I'm the perfect human.

813
00:40:40,085 --> 00:40:41,887
I work in non-profit.

814
00:40:42,121 --> 00:40:44,354
I just offered to go get wood.

815
00:40:44,356 --> 00:40:45,389
You're welcome.

816
00:40:45,391 --> 00:40:46,758
It's not his fault
he's chivalrous

817
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,825
and you're a dick, Larry.

818
00:40:47,827 --> 00:40:49,661
Hey, at least I still have mine.

819
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:51,762
You seen the size of those
fucking ticks out there?

820
00:40:51,764 --> 00:40:53,231
They don't want
your dick, trust me.

821
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:54,499
How would you know?

822
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:56,403
Yeah, we really missed out.

823
00:40:57,436 --> 00:40:58,271
You didn't.

824
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:01,074
Whatever, not worth it.

825
00:41:01,574 --> 00:41:03,173
Ever the pacifist.

826
00:41:03,175 --> 00:41:05,376
Why, because I don't care
about your tick-bait dick?

827
00:41:05,378 --> 00:41:07,012
No, because you don't
care that someone

828
00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:08,345
called your dad crazy and said

829
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:09,947
it's only a matter
of time for you!

830
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:11,548
The woman is grieving, man,

831
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,684
she just lost her husband!

832
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:14,117
I'm not gonna be
a jerk about it!

833
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,686
No, of course not.

834
00:41:15,688 --> 00:41:17,387
It would ruin your reputation
as a fucking saint!

835
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:20,023
Shut up, you don't know
what you're talking about.

836
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:21,425
There it is, there
it is, let it out.

837
00:41:21,427 --> 00:41:22,730
Fuck you!

838
00:41:23,797 --> 00:41:26,032
Okay, you satisfied,
prick, fuck you.

839
00:41:27,766 --> 00:41:28,666
Hey!

840
00:41:28,668 --> 00:41:29,870
Hey, hey, stop it.

841
00:41:34,373 --> 00:41:37,141
Well, there goes
your peace prize.

842
00:41:37,143 --> 00:41:38,842
I'll come with you, Paul.

843
00:41:38,844 --> 00:41:40,146
Let's go get tick bit.

844
00:41:48,822 --> 00:41:50,121
Don't pay attention.

845
00:41:50,123 --> 00:41:51,759
They do this all the time.

846
00:41:56,996 --> 00:41:58,432
Where are they going?

847
00:41:58,965 --> 00:41:59,963
For a screw.

848
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:01,168
Yeah right.

849
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:03,833
So she dates girls, right?

850
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:05,471
Most lesbians do.

851
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:08,673
Paul's really nice.

852
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:10,374
And so is Mr. Rogers.

853
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:11,110
Who?

854
00:42:11,644 --> 00:42:14,077
That old dude that used
to ride tiny trains

855
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,083
with a bunch of puppets on them?

856
00:42:16,983 --> 00:42:18,284
That's really creepy.

857
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:19,883
Exactly.

858
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
That's why I always come on
when you least... expect it.

859
00:42:27,994 --> 00:42:29,396
Oh, Jesus fuck!

860
00:42:29,862 --> 00:42:33,331
Oh man damn, that was... fuck.

861
00:42:40,873 --> 00:42:42,474
It's a raccoon.

862
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,943
The size of a horse?

863
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,047
Damn, how many of
them are there?

864
00:42:52,751 --> 00:42:54,684
Oh my god, that's him.

865
00:42:54,686 --> 00:42:55,954
What, who?

866
00:42:55,956 --> 00:42:56,954
Him!

867
00:42:56,956 --> 00:42:57,887
What about him?

868
00:42:57,889 --> 00:42:59,590
That's the man.

869
00:42:59,592 --> 00:43:00,825
That's the man that I saw.

870
00:43:00,827 --> 00:43:01,791
In this picture?

871
00:43:01,793 --> 00:43:03,293
No, in the window.

872
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,662
Babe, have some water.

873
00:43:04,664 --> 00:43:06,731
No, no, I saw him yesterday.

874
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:07,898
And today I thought...

875
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,367
It couldn't be.

876
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:10,370
Why not?

877
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:13,104
'Cause that's Max.

878
00:43:13,106 --> 00:43:14,704
Who's Max?

879
00:43:14,706 --> 00:43:16,941
Max, the guy we just buried.

880
00:43:16,943 --> 00:43:18,041
He's dead.

881
00:43:18,043 --> 00:43:18,976
Very dead.

882
00:43:18,978 --> 00:43:20,545
Not anymore.

883
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:23,548
Ooh!

884
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,985
Man it sucks out there.

885
00:43:25,751 --> 00:43:27,818
You guys okay?

886
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,854
Yeah, yeah we're fine.

887
00:43:29,856 --> 00:43:31,859
Just a little tipsy.

888
00:43:32,724 --> 00:43:33,993
As you should be.

889
00:43:37,297 --> 00:43:38,862
Man, the window in
the kitchen busted.

890
00:43:38,864 --> 00:43:40,731
Yeah, 'cause it's a
fucking thousand years old.

891
00:43:40,733 --> 00:43:42,066
All right, I'm gonna
call a cab.

892
00:43:42,068 --> 00:43:43,767
Huh, I don't blame you.

893
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:44,871
Can I come?

894
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:47,472
Oh yeah, because
they're everywhere.

895
00:43:47,474 --> 00:43:50,407
Just hop on down the corner
and fucking hail one.

896
00:43:50,409 --> 00:43:52,411
Okay, well I'm not staying here.

897
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:53,744
We're in Wisconsin, babe.

898
00:43:53,746 --> 00:43:55,612
We're in the middle of nowhere.

899
00:43:55,614 --> 00:43:57,182
You wanted to come.

900
00:43:57,184 --> 00:43:59,617
I want to milk cows,
I want to eat cheese.

901
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:01,184
I didn't know that
we'd be in a shack

902
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:02,720
in the middle of the woods

903
00:44:02,722 --> 00:44:05,155
with fucking dead people
and rabid dogs in the walls!

904
00:44:05,157 --> 00:44:06,590
Well it's not really a shack.

905
00:44:06,592 --> 00:44:07,758
I said it was rustic!

906
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
This is not rustic, Jack.

907
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:11,128
This is survival!

908
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:14,567
Hello?

909
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:19,405
Hi, I need a cab to
the airport please.

910
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:23,210
No, I know, I know.

911
00:44:24,677 --> 00:44:25,943
Where are we?

912
00:44:25,945 --> 00:44:26,978
The Lehman house.

913
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:27,778
The Lehman house.

914
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,713
Black Hill road.

915
00:44:28,715 --> 00:44:30,050
On Black Hill road.

916
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:35,489
Hello?

917
00:44:36,588 --> 00:44:37,456
Hello?

918
00:44:40,126 --> 00:44:42,358
Maybe there's service
in the main house.

919
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,996
Or Sylvia could drive us.

920
00:44:44,297 --> 00:44:45,896
The woman just
buried her husband.

921
00:44:45,898 --> 00:44:48,532
We can't ask her to drive
30 miles in a rainstorm.

922
00:44:48,534 --> 00:44:50,001
That's what happens
when you live

923
00:44:50,003 --> 00:44:51,434
in the middle of
the fucking boonies.

924
00:44:51,436 --> 00:44:52,802
You have to drive people
places, deal with it.

925
00:44:52,804 --> 00:44:54,371
Dude, let it go.

926
00:44:54,373 --> 00:44:56,039
If you wanna act like a
pussy, do it on your own time.

927
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:58,508
I didn't cheat a dead guy out
of a fucking science grant

928
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,510
20 years ago, I have
nothing to apologize for

929
00:45:00,512 --> 00:45:01,845
so don't include
me in your fucking

930
00:45:01,847 --> 00:45:03,347
never ending <i>mea culpa.</i>

931
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:05,016
So sleeping with his
girlfriends doesn't count?

932
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:06,550
Oh Jesus, it was
college, asshole,

933
00:45:06,552 --> 00:45:08,355
who didn't sleep
with his girlfriends?

934
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:09,690
You did?

935
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:11,255
What?

936
00:45:11,257 --> 00:45:13,157
No, I... maybe.

937
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:14,858
I don't know.

938
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,092
We're here, okay.

939
00:45:16,094 --> 00:45:17,729
We all did shit
we're not proud of

940
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:18,963
but we're here now so can we
please try to be civilized

941
00:45:18,965 --> 00:45:20,197
for a goddamn second?

942
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:22,398
And who the fuck
finished the wine?

943
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,501
You have a drinking problem.

944
00:45:24,503 --> 00:45:25,336
No fucking duh.

945
00:45:25,338 --> 00:45:26,704
Who the hell has a funeral

946
00:45:26,706 --> 00:45:27,972
in the middle of the
damn woods anyway?

947
00:45:27,974 --> 00:45:29,240
Oh Max does, of course he does.

948
00:45:29,242 --> 00:45:30,809
God forbid he make
anything easy.

949
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,342
It's like making people
go to your wedding

950
00:45:32,344 --> 00:45:34,513
in Columbus, Ohio
on New Years Eve.

951
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,912
You didn't have to come, Larry.

952
00:45:35,914 --> 00:45:37,481
No one dragged you there.

953
00:45:37,483 --> 00:45:39,150
The roads are closed, Amber.

954
00:45:39,152 --> 00:45:40,083
No one's gonna drive you.

955
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:41,487
Then I'll walk.

956
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,759
Fine, go.

957
00:45:48,994 --> 00:45:50,961
You wanna go?!

958
00:45:50,963 --> 00:45:52,128
Hey, whoah.

959
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:52,963
- You wanna go.
- Don't touch me!

960
00:45:52,965 --> 00:45:53,998
Relax!

961
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,432
Hey, if you wanna go, go.

962
00:45:55,434 --> 00:45:57,668
You can't even catch the
right train to Brooklyn.

963
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:00,271
You think you're gonna
find the fucking airport?

964
00:46:00,273 --> 00:46:01,541
Good luck!

965
00:46:02,574 --> 00:46:03,807
Oh, come on!

966
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:05,012
What the fuck?

967
00:46:06,612 --> 00:46:07,912
I'm sorry.

968
00:46:07,914 --> 00:46:11,081
I tried to call but
the lines are down.

969
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:12,650
Yeah, we got that.

970
00:46:12,652 --> 00:46:15,355
Nature's way of telling
us to unplug I guess.

971
00:46:18,023 --> 00:46:19,691
Any trouble with the rooms?

972
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:20,758
Actually, kind of, yeah.

973
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,825
Do you have...

974
00:46:21,827 --> 00:46:22,661
-Yeah, the kitchen window broke.

975
00:46:22,996 --> 00:46:25,396
Oh geez.

976
00:46:25,398 --> 00:46:27,498
We're fine.

977
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,367
We're actually not fucking fine.

978
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,869
Oh geez, I am
sorry, the windows.

979
00:46:32,871 --> 00:46:34,238
But don't worry about it.

980
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,507
We can just use one of these.

981
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:37,409
I brought these
tarps, in case, um,

982
00:46:38,577 --> 00:46:42,246
we had some leaking in the
crawlspace a while back

983
00:46:42,248 --> 00:46:45,249
and I'm a little worried
about the foundation.

984
00:46:45,251 --> 00:46:47,717
Of the fucking house?

985
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:49,755
Under it, really.

986
00:46:50,922 --> 00:46:53,791
Oh is that the animal
farm you got down there?

987
00:46:53,793 --> 00:46:57,026
'Cause they were having a
fucking dance party earlier.

988
00:46:57,028 --> 00:46:59,197
Oh, I don't think so.

989
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,268
An animal could
barely fit in there.

990
00:47:02,168 --> 00:47:03,434
We used to have raccoons

991
00:47:03,436 --> 00:47:05,605
but Max chased those
away years ago.

992
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:07,905
No.

993
00:47:07,907 --> 00:47:10,874
No, the only thing that's
there is old boxes and dust.

994
00:47:10,876 --> 00:47:12,876
Huh, well this was not dust.

995
00:47:12,878 --> 00:47:15,545
It was like a couple
fat guys on a treadmill.

996
00:47:15,547 --> 00:47:18,481
So you might wanna maybe
reset your traps or something.

997
00:47:18,483 --> 00:47:20,583
We don't really do traps.

998
00:47:20,585 --> 00:47:22,420
The only killing
that we do out here

999
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,124
is of the mercy variety.

1000
00:47:24,891 --> 00:47:26,289
Oh my god.

1001
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:29,459
Anyhoo, here are
the tarps, Paul.

1002
00:47:29,461 --> 00:47:31,795
If you don't mind
checking the crawlspace

1003
00:47:31,797 --> 00:47:33,097
when you get a chance.

1004
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:37,504
It's just no handyman till
after the storm passes.

1005
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,606
Yeah, mmhmm, yeah sure.

1006
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:42,106
Great.

1007
00:47:42,108 --> 00:47:44,941
It's through the carport.

1008
00:47:44,943 --> 00:47:48,815
And, um... under the house.

1009
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:52,016
Great.

1010
00:47:52,284 --> 00:47:53,950
Listen, Sylvia.

1011
00:47:53,952 --> 00:47:57,454
A few of us were thinking about
heading out a little early,

1012
00:47:57,456 --> 00:47:59,456
you know just get ahead
of the rain, you know.

1013
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:02,596
Yeah, any chance you could
drive us to the airport?

1014
00:48:03,563 --> 00:48:06,097
Oh, well I mean I would

1015
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:07,898
but the roads are washed out.

1016
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,537
But they should be
clear by daybreak.

1017
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:12,404
Morning daybreak?

1018
00:48:13,338 --> 00:48:16,407
Yeah, happens every
October through March.

1019
00:48:16,409 --> 00:48:17,844
Nature's curfew.

1020
00:48:19,478 --> 00:48:20,846
That's really cute.

1021
00:48:21,748 --> 00:48:25,215
If the lights blow, we keep
candles and a kerosene lamp

1022
00:48:25,217 --> 00:48:27,219
or two in the back
of the basement.

1023
00:48:28,353 --> 00:48:30,756
May as well just
shelter from the storm.

1024
00:48:40,867 --> 00:48:43,233
Maybe we should pack
it in, try to sleep.

1025
00:48:43,235 --> 00:48:45,436
I'm too wired to sleep.

1026
00:48:45,438 --> 00:48:46,806
I'm probably too sober.

1027
00:48:48,106 --> 00:48:49,440
What is the deal
with this thing?

1028
00:48:49,442 --> 00:48:50,974
Does the garbage
disposal even work?

1029
00:48:50,976 --> 00:48:53,311
Maybe Amber's right, this
is kind of fucked up.

1030
00:48:53,313 --> 00:48:54,711
Oh please, she's a ding dong.

1031
00:48:54,713 --> 00:48:57,615
Hey Paul, this thing
is totally clogged.

1032
00:48:57,617 --> 00:48:59,249
Maybe the pump is broken.

1033
00:48:59,251 --> 00:49:00,316
She's not a...

1034
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:02,586
I mean she's young and hot.

1035
00:49:02,588 --> 00:49:05,121
Hey Paul, can you
please check the well?

1036
00:49:05,123 --> 00:49:06,324
She's not an idiot.

1037
00:49:06,326 --> 00:49:07,791
Nice of you to defend her.

1038
00:49:07,793 --> 00:49:09,325
Well, because she
doesn't even want a beer,

1039
00:49:09,327 --> 00:49:10,595
give her a break.

1040
00:49:10,597 --> 00:49:11,829
Please.

1041
00:49:15,201 --> 00:49:16,369
Uh, Sylvia?

1042
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,670
Oh, good, it's you.

1043
00:49:20,672 --> 00:49:22,274
Could you give me a hand, Paul?

1044
00:49:22,507 --> 00:49:25,041
Oh, I was just coming
down to check the well.

1045
00:49:25,043 --> 00:49:27,010
The sink's all backed up.

1046
00:49:27,012 --> 00:49:28,545
Oh, sorry about that.

1047
00:49:28,547 --> 00:49:31,450
There really is no good
way to dispose of these.

1048
00:49:34,621 --> 00:49:36,052
<i>What do you care?</i>

1049
00:49:36,054 --> 00:49:37,354
It's not like you're
gonna remember anyway.

1050
00:49:37,356 --> 00:49:38,356
You'll be blacked out by nine.

1051
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:39,824
What the fuck?

1052
00:49:39,826 --> 00:49:42,025
I mean, two baby
showers, Elaine?

1053
00:49:42,027 --> 00:49:43,126
Oh my god.

1054
00:49:43,128 --> 00:49:44,293
And you didn't come to Jojo's,

1055
00:49:44,295 --> 00:49:45,229
you didn't come to Sally's.

1056
00:49:45,231 --> 00:49:46,264
She's your step-kid.

1057
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:47,898
She was four years old!

1058
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,635
She was two and a half and
she was still my first baby!

1059
00:49:50,637 --> 00:49:52,101
Seriously, who doesn't
visit their best friend

1060
00:49:52,103 --> 00:49:54,572
just because they live
a fucking bus ride away?

1061
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,907
It's Connecticut,
Bess, not a bus ride.

1062
00:49:56,909 --> 00:49:59,010
It's called the
Metro North, Elaine,

1063
00:49:59,012 --> 00:50:00,811
and it takes about
an hour and a half!

1064
00:50:00,813 --> 00:50:02,479
You're right, I'm so sorry!

1065
00:50:02,481 --> 00:50:03,880
Between paying two rents,
changing adult diapers

1066
00:50:03,882 --> 00:50:05,682
and keeping my mom from
falling down the stairs,

1067
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:08,284
I definitely had time for
a joyride to the suburbs!

1068
00:50:08,286 --> 00:50:09,519
We would have come in, okay?

1069
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:10,887
We could have come
to the funeral,

1070
00:50:10,889 --> 00:50:12,722
taken you out to lunch,
taken you to the park.

1071
00:50:12,724 --> 00:50:14,391
Oh because going to
a fucking petting zoo

1072
00:50:14,393 --> 00:50:16,659
with your perfect family is
exactly how I want to spend

1073
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:18,195
my first days as an orphan!

1074
00:50:18,197 --> 00:50:19,563
You made a choice!

1075
00:50:19,565 --> 00:50:20,965
You were all about work.

1076
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:22,465
You never once talked
about having kids!

1077
00:50:22,467 --> 00:50:24,168
Oh how could I?

1078
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,737
You never for a second stopped
fucking talking about yours!

1079
00:50:45,257 --> 00:50:46,692
Everyone okay?

1080
00:50:49,094 --> 00:50:50,963
I think we unclogged the sink.

1081
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,900
Oh, come on, dudes!

1082
00:50:55,134 --> 00:50:56,369
Fuck.

1083
00:50:56,635 --> 00:50:57,936
I'm gonna change.

1084
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:04,744
Of course it doesn't.

1085
00:51:06,545 --> 00:51:07,613
Come on.

1086
00:51:15,887 --> 00:51:16,755
Oh gosh.

1087
00:51:17,724 --> 00:51:19,525
I should be listening
to my uh oh feelings.

1088
00:51:19,724 --> 00:51:21,258
Ah, smells like shit down here.

1089
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,726
That's what I tell the kids.

1090
00:51:22,728 --> 00:51:24,662
Listen to their uh oh feelings.

1091
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:25,595
What are they, five?

1092
00:51:25,597 --> 00:51:26,699
They're fucking idiots.

1093
00:51:27,266 --> 00:51:28,565
I don't see any lamps.

1094
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:30,570
Okay, hold up, would you please?

1095
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,406
She said back of
the basement, ah.

1096
00:51:35,106 --> 00:51:36,342
Back of the basement.

1097
00:51:37,175 --> 00:51:38,641
Come on, Larry.

1098
00:51:38,643 --> 00:51:40,209
I'm sure it's in here.

1099
00:51:40,211 --> 00:51:41,112
Yeah.

1100
00:51:44,617 --> 00:51:47,387
Yeah, maybe some old
Playboys back here.

1101
00:51:50,755 --> 00:51:52,057
Blow up sex doll.

1102
00:51:54,092 --> 00:51:55,027
That'd be fun, huh?

1103
00:51:56,295 --> 00:51:57,762
Okay, wait.

1104
00:51:57,764 --> 00:52:00,396
Is this it, this is
one of those, um...

1105
00:52:00,398 --> 00:52:01,831
Oh yeah, that's, let me see.

1106
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:02,867
- Camping lamps, right?
- Yup.

1107
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,767
I think you just...

1108
00:52:04,769 --> 00:52:06,706
I think you just...

1109
00:52:09,842 --> 00:52:11,575
- Yup.
- Ah, cool.

1110
00:52:11,577 --> 00:52:12,445
Boom.

1111
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:14,345
We have light.

1112
00:52:14,347 --> 00:52:16,313
Oh, it smells like a
damn public bathroom, man.

1113
00:52:16,315 --> 00:52:17,682
It was like a stack.

1114
00:52:17,684 --> 00:52:19,282
It was like a stack
of animals, dude.

1115
00:52:19,284 --> 00:52:20,383
And Sylvia was just...

1116
00:52:20,385 --> 00:52:21,318
Dude, I don't wanna know, man.

1117
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,552
I'm sorry, I can't.

1118
00:52:22,554 --> 00:52:24,153
I just, I don't
have my pipe here

1119
00:52:24,155 --> 00:52:24,990
and I just...

1120
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:27,858
I'm not high enough
to hear this shit.

1121
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,994
And you definitely can't
be telling the girls.

1122
00:52:29,996 --> 00:52:32,097
We cannot take any
more crazy right now.

1123
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:34,697
Fine, can you just hand
me the tarps please?

1124
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:36,133
You know, you're nuts, man.

1125
00:52:36,135 --> 00:52:37,400
The last thing we
should be doing

1126
00:52:37,402 --> 00:52:38,702
is Sylvia's damn housework.

1127
00:52:38,704 --> 00:52:40,003
Right, whatever, come on.

1128
00:52:40,005 --> 00:52:41,838
You know, that's
why she asked you.

1129
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,576
She knew that you would be
the only sucker to say yes.

1130
00:52:46,244 --> 00:52:47,112
Bye.

1131
00:52:48,213 --> 00:52:49,615
Look at that.

1132
00:52:53,652 --> 00:52:54,617
Is it on?

1133
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:56,653
Yeah, say cheese.

1134
00:52:56,655 --> 00:52:58,958
Maybe Sylvia's working
on a rat documentary.

1135
00:52:59,257 --> 00:53:00,324
Wanna say a few words?

1136
00:53:00,326 --> 00:53:01,691
Turn it off, it's super creepy.

1137
00:53:01,693 --> 00:53:03,427
You look really
hot in this light.

1138
00:53:03,429 --> 00:53:04,795
Shut up.

1139
00:53:04,797 --> 00:53:07,396
Maybe Max has a science
blog, LonelyMax15.

1140
00:53:07,398 --> 00:53:08,800
Right, Max on the internet.

1141
00:53:08,802 --> 00:53:11,300
He wouldn't even be
in photographs.

1142
00:53:11,302 --> 00:53:12,269
Okay, let's see.

1143
00:53:12,271 --> 00:53:13,336
Let's see what's on it.

1144
00:53:13,338 --> 00:53:14,871
No, Larry, stop, okay,

1145
00:53:14,873 --> 00:53:16,206
what if he's masturbating
or something?

1146
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:17,441
I don't want that
image in my head.

1147
00:53:17,443 --> 00:53:18,608
Dead guy jacking off?

1148
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:19,679
Larry.

1149
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:24,847
And, ah, not naked.

1150
00:53:24,849 --> 00:53:26,983
Needs a shower maybe but...

1151
00:53:26,985 --> 00:53:27,885
Oh, Max.

1152
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:29,121
<i>Yeah, uh.</i>

1153
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:32,121
<i>Those were some
really great years.</i>

1154
00:53:32,123 --> 00:53:37,996
<i>You know, you guys, you were
the McHale Hall Crew, and...</i>

1155
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:42,534
<i>...my best friends, so.</i>

1156
00:53:51,344 --> 00:53:54,213
I know I'll see you
on the other side, so...

1157
00:53:57,483 --> 00:53:58,914
Forgive me.

1158
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:03,855
What the fuck?

1159
00:54:04,289 --> 00:54:05,657
Oh Jesus.

1160
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:07,691
Why did you show me that?

1161
00:54:07,693 --> 00:54:10,594
Why the fuck did we
watch that, you asshole!

1162
00:54:10,596 --> 00:54:11,762
I didn't know.

1163
00:54:11,764 --> 00:54:12,795
I didn't know!

1164
00:54:12,797 --> 00:54:14,197
How was I supposed to know

1165
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:15,331
that he was gonna off
himself on camera?

1166
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:16,233
She didn't tell us.

1167
00:54:16,235 --> 00:54:17,300
She did, remember?

1168
00:54:17,302 --> 00:54:18,834
She said he asked for us.

1169
00:54:18,836 --> 00:54:20,371
Not before he offed himself,
she didn't say that!

1170
00:54:20,373 --> 00:54:21,637
Well, she didn't have to,

1171
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:23,005
we got to see for ourselves.

1172
00:54:23,007 --> 00:54:24,608
Why didn't he say anything?

1173
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:27,276
I mean who did he have, Sylvia?

1174
00:54:27,278 --> 00:54:28,278
He had us.

1175
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,014
Yeah, right.

1176
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,282
He should
have told somebody.

1177
00:54:31,284 --> 00:54:32,182
Who?

1178
00:54:32,184 --> 00:54:33,251
He's a therapist.

1179
00:54:33,253 --> 00:54:34,687
Another fucking
therapist, I don't know.

1180
00:54:35,387 --> 00:54:37,686
Fuck, Larry, we
shouldn't have seen that.

1181
00:54:37,688 --> 00:54:39,021
It was private.

1182
00:54:39,023 --> 00:54:41,358
Please, she didn't
take the tape out.

1183
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,562
The camera was on.

1184
00:54:42,762 --> 00:54:43,793
Well maybe it was a
shrine or something

1185
00:54:43,795 --> 00:54:45,362
too painful to deal with.

1186
00:54:45,364 --> 00:54:47,197
So she sends us down
here to get candles

1187
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:48,300
and kerosene lamps?

1188
00:54:56,074 --> 00:54:57,273
Oh shit.

1189
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Um... uh dude?
I think there's something in...

1190
00:55:05,717 --> 00:55:06,615
Ah shit!
No, fuck, get off!

1191
00:55:06,617 --> 00:55:07,650
Get the fuck off!

1192
00:55:07,652 --> 00:55:08,686
Yo!

1193
00:55:08,688 --> 00:55:10,088
Goddamn shit!

1194
00:55:11,289 --> 00:55:12,354
The fuck?

1195
00:55:12,356 --> 00:55:13,226
Dude?

1196
00:55:14,226 --> 00:55:15,358
You all right, man?

1197
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,764
No, I'm, I'm fine.

1198
00:55:18,496 --> 00:55:20,329
I'm fine.

1199
00:55:20,331 --> 00:55:21,166
I'm fine.

1200
00:55:23,536 --> 00:55:24,604
Oh shit.

1201
00:55:29,507 --> 00:55:30,576
Oh shit.

1202
00:55:42,554 --> 00:55:43,623
He reloaded?

1203
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:49,525
Is that Sylvia?

1204
00:55:49,527 --> 00:55:50,862
Yeah.

1205
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:53,733
Not exactly sheltering
from the storm.

1206
00:56:10,516 --> 00:56:11,384
What was that?

1207
00:56:16,887 --> 00:56:17,787
Oh Jesus.

1208
00:56:17,789 --> 00:56:18,891
Oh my god.

1209
00:56:31,603 --> 00:56:32,702
Fuck!

1210
00:56:32,704 --> 00:56:33,903
What, what, come on, come on!

1211
00:56:33,905 --> 00:56:35,005
It won't budge!

1212
00:56:35,007 --> 00:56:36,940
I can't do it, it's just locked.

1213
00:56:36,942 --> 00:56:38,842
- Guys!
- Guys!

1214
00:56:38,844 --> 00:56:39,912
Hey guys!

1215
00:56:49,021 --> 00:56:51,021
You are a saint, dude.

1216
00:56:51,023 --> 00:56:53,259
Not enough people like
you in this world.

1217
00:56:54,693 --> 00:56:55,925
Thanks, man, thanks.

1218
00:56:55,927 --> 00:56:58,161
Oh shit
man, what happened?

1219
00:56:58,163 --> 00:57:00,831
- Oh, there's this...
- You gotta wrap that, man,

1220
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:02,465
that is nasty.

1221
00:57:02,467 --> 00:57:03,934
Thanks man, I'll do that.

1222
00:57:03,936 --> 00:57:05,903
Hey, so what'd you find?

1223
00:57:05,905 --> 00:57:07,037
Any cash?

1224
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:09,809
Oh no, it's just
a bunch of junk.

1225
00:57:10,643 --> 00:57:12,008
Total hoarders huh?

1226
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,411
Yeah, yeah some
people don't know

1227
00:57:14,413 --> 00:57:15,780
when to let things go.

1228
00:57:15,782 --> 00:57:17,581
- Hey guys!
- Guys!

1229
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:20,353
Where the fuck did everybody go?

1230
00:57:22,621 --> 00:57:23,619
Fuck, I can't get through that.

1231
00:57:23,621 --> 00:57:24,753
Wait.

1232
00:57:24,755 --> 00:57:26,090
Do you hear that?

1233
00:57:28,226 --> 00:57:29,626
Hey!

1234
00:57:29,628 --> 00:57:30,894
Yo guys!

1235
00:57:30,896 --> 00:57:32,295
Who is that?

1236
00:57:32,297 --> 00:57:33,697
Fuck if I know.

1237
00:57:33,699 --> 00:57:35,065
Maybe Jack and Gandhi are
done underneath the house.

1238
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:36,132
It doesn't sound like Jack.

1239
00:57:36,134 --> 00:57:38,668
Yeah, sure shit ain't Paul.

1240
00:57:41,239 --> 00:57:42,107
Holy shit!

1241
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:45,842
Open the fucking door!

1242
00:57:45,844 --> 00:57:47,112
Help guys!

1243
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,748
Hey, hey, hey!

1244
00:57:50,949 --> 00:57:52,216
Fuck, fuck, come on!

1245
00:57:52,518 --> 00:57:53,918
Fuck!

1246
00:57:54,186 --> 00:57:55,920
What the hell, dudes,
what are you doing?

1247
00:57:55,922 --> 00:57:56,987
Going to second fucking base,

1248
00:57:56,989 --> 00:57:57,920
what do you think we're doing?!

1249
00:57:57,922 --> 00:57:58,921
Well what happened?

1250
00:57:58,923 --> 00:57:59,889
It's Max.

1251
00:57:59,891 --> 00:58:01,391
What?

1252
00:58:01,393 --> 00:58:02,161
Max?

1253
00:58:04,663 --> 00:58:05,998
He's fucking back.

1254
00:58:10,135 --> 00:58:12,369
What you said was that
you saw Max shoot himself.

1255
00:58:12,371 --> 00:58:13,570
We did.

1256
00:58:13,572 --> 00:58:15,274
Well who the hell is
gonna kill a guy twice?

1257
00:58:15,474 --> 00:58:17,541
Fuck me, come on!

1258
00:58:17,543 --> 00:58:19,376
He was right there, I swear.

1259
00:58:19,378 --> 00:58:20,276
Told you.

1260
00:58:20,278 --> 00:58:21,845
There was fighting, okay?

1261
00:58:21,847 --> 00:58:23,447
Someone was fighting,
we heard a thump

1262
00:58:23,449 --> 00:58:26,450
and then suddenly his dead
ass body is on the ground

1263
00:58:26,452 --> 00:58:28,017
staring back at us.

1264
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:29,952
The same dead ass body
we buried this afternoon?

1265
00:58:29,954 --> 00:58:31,220
I don't know.

1266
00:58:31,222 --> 00:58:32,557
Okay, so
where's the body?

1267
00:58:33,025 --> 00:58:34,090
I mean did he walk away?

1268
00:58:34,092 --> 00:58:35,958
I don't see drag marks.

1269
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,094
Well, it's been raining.

1270
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,494
What are you, CSI guy now?

1271
00:58:38,496 --> 00:58:40,331
Wanna test for
fucking coat fibers?

1272
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,965
What happened
to your arm?

1273
00:58:41,967 --> 00:58:43,499
All I'm saying is that
if there was a body

1274
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:45,034
it would be here.

1275
00:58:45,036 --> 00:58:46,536
Well so maybe that freaky
kid dug up Max's body

1276
00:58:46,538 --> 00:58:48,704
and he's running
around scaring the shit

1277
00:58:48,706 --> 00:58:49,572
out of people with it.

1278
00:58:49,574 --> 00:58:50,441
Jack?

1279
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,608
Hold on, babe.

1280
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,177
I don't
know, it's Wisconsin.

1281
00:58:53,179 --> 00:58:54,577
What do people do
for fun around here?

1282
00:58:54,579 --> 00:58:55,744
So an 18 year
old's gonna drag around

1283
00:58:55,746 --> 00:58:56,646
a 200 pound dead man?

1284
00:58:56,648 --> 00:58:58,081
Maybe he had help.

1285
00:58:58,083 --> 00:58:59,715
Who would do
that, another student,

1286
00:58:59,717 --> 00:59:01,084
a member of the faculty?

1287
00:59:01,086 --> 00:59:02,318
Maybe.

1288
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,052
Why?

1289
00:59:03,054 --> 00:59:04,119
Jack, what is that?

1290
00:59:04,121 --> 00:59:05,521
Just a second, babe.

1291
00:59:05,523 --> 00:59:07,257
I don't know
dude, I don't know why.

1292
00:59:07,259 --> 00:59:08,525
Max wasn't exactly the
easiest to get along with.

1293
00:59:08,527 --> 00:59:10,360
But he's
not a monster, man.

1294
00:59:10,362 --> 00:59:12,597
I mean you wouldn't dig him
out of the ground over it.

1295
00:59:14,532 --> 00:59:15,432
To someone out there,
death was not punishment enough.

1296
00:59:15,434 --> 00:59:15,932
Jack!

1297
00:59:15,934 --> 00:59:16,700
What?

1298
00:59:20,472 --> 00:59:21,307
Shit!

1299
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,416
Oh... oh shit.

1300
00:59:32,684 --> 00:59:33,583
Oh god.

1301
00:59:33,585 --> 00:59:34,684
Jack!

1302
00:59:34,686 --> 00:59:35,954
Are you all right, man?

1303
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:37,688
What the fuck was that, man?

1304
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:38,755
What the fuck was that?

1305
00:59:38,757 --> 00:59:40,023
Oh my god, it's a trap,

1306
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:41,057
a fucking animal trap.

1307
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:42,159
Look at that shit!

1308
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,693
It's gotta be like a trip line

1309
00:59:43,695 --> 00:59:44,894
right, for the dogs, to
keep them off the property!

1310
00:59:46,965 --> 00:59:48,300
What was that?

1311
00:59:49,034 --> 00:59:50,400
We've gotta get out of here.

1312
00:59:50,402 --> 00:59:51,668
No, we have to take
him to a hospital

1313
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:53,170
'cause he doesn't look good.

1314
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,637
We're gonna have to ask
Sylvia to borrow her car.

1315
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:56,305
No, fuck that,
we're gonna take it.

1316
00:59:56,307 --> 00:59:58,074
I'm not stealing a car, Larry!

1317
00:59:58,076 --> 00:59:59,342
You know what, you stay here

1318
00:59:59,344 --> 01:00:00,844
and console the fucking widow.

1319
01:00:00,846 --> 01:00:02,479
And tell him how bummed you are

1320
01:00:02,481 --> 01:00:04,847
that her husband keeps
showing up covered in blood.

1321
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:05,883
But I am done here!

1322
01:00:05,885 --> 01:00:07,184
We have to tell Sylvia.

1323
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,086
I mean it's gotta be a prank!

1324
01:00:09,088 --> 01:00:10,186
Oh because this is
really, really funny.

1325
01:00:10,188 --> 01:00:11,755
And even if it's not,

1326
01:00:11,757 --> 01:00:13,222
I mean if somebody is
desecrating her husband's grave

1327
01:00:13,224 --> 01:00:15,559
she has a right to know!

1328
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:17,293
Okay fine, you
want to tell Sylvia

1329
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:19,331
someone dug up her husband,
now's you're chance.

1330
01:00:20,666 --> 01:00:22,197
Good luck with that, dude.

1331
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:23,368
Oh that's typical.

1332
01:00:24,804 --> 01:00:25,872
What was that?

1333
01:00:27,204 --> 01:00:28,438
You, sticking your neck out,

1334
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,173
it's not really
your thing, is it?

1335
01:00:30,175 --> 01:00:31,974
What the hell, man,

1336
01:00:31,976 --> 01:00:33,209
now you're gonna ball up?

1337
01:00:33,211 --> 01:00:35,110
It's cool, I'll go.

1338
01:00:35,112 --> 01:00:37,613
No, no, no, fuck that, I'll go.

1339
01:00:37,615 --> 01:00:38,882
Yeah, up to you.

1340
01:00:38,884 --> 01:00:40,550
Let's go!

1341
01:00:40,552 --> 01:00:42,753
You picked the fucking hell
of a time to ball up, dude.

1342
01:00:42,755 --> 01:00:44,320
I'm taking her car.

1343
01:00:44,322 --> 01:00:45,255
I'll come too.

1344
01:00:45,257 --> 01:00:46,423
- What?
- What?

1345
01:00:46,425 --> 01:00:47,657
Or I could stay here, you know

1346
01:00:47,659 --> 01:00:48,525
if Amber needs me.

1347
01:00:48,527 --> 01:00:49,295
Bess can stay!

1348
01:00:51,096 --> 01:00:52,565
I'll be back in a sec, babe.

1349
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:56,967
If you leave without
me, I will find you,

1350
01:00:56,969 --> 01:00:58,367
set fire to your apartment

1351
01:00:58,369 --> 01:01:00,705
and tell your girlfriend
we fucked in the shower.

1352
01:01:00,972 --> 01:01:02,905
You must be an amazing mother.

1353
01:01:02,907 --> 01:01:04,441
I'm serious, Jack.

1354
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:06,646
Don't you fucking start
that engine without me.

1355
01:01:26,664 --> 01:01:28,231
What are you gonna
do with a knife,

1356
01:01:28,233 --> 01:01:29,768
the guy's already dead!

1357
01:01:30,001 --> 01:01:32,267
You're right, you're
totally right.

1358
01:01:32,269 --> 01:01:33,405
I need a shotgun.

1359
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:35,338
Can you fire a shotgun?

1360
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:38,275
No, okay, but like
an ax or something.

1361
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,577
But we like to have
decapitate him.

1362
01:01:39,878 --> 01:01:41,146
Okay, you watch a lot of TV.

1363
01:01:41,545 --> 01:01:43,612
Sorry, I don't want
my brains eaten.

1364
01:01:43,614 --> 01:01:45,782
Look, look, there's that
wack job student of Max

1365
01:01:45,784 --> 01:01:47,483
who's just pissed off
decides to freak out his wife

1366
01:01:47,485 --> 01:01:48,885
to fuck up his
body, I don't know,

1367
01:01:48,887 --> 01:01:49,885
people are sick.

1368
01:01:49,887 --> 01:01:51,320
Knives, knives.

1369
01:01:51,322 --> 01:01:53,155
Will you stop it, you
don't need a knife!

1370
01:01:53,157 --> 01:01:54,557
How do you know?

1371
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,258
How do you know that
he's not gonna come back

1372
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:59,695
with a dead guy, with a
whole bunch of dead guys?

1373
01:01:59,697 --> 01:02:01,398
Amber, stop it!

1374
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,034
It's about to be the zombie
freaking apocalypse in here!

1375
01:02:05,036 --> 01:02:07,503
Amber, stop!

1376
01:02:07,505 --> 01:02:10,173
- Mrs. Lehman?
- Norma?

1377
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,577
- Louder.
- Norma?

1378
01:02:12,543 --> 01:02:15,013
Sorry to bother
you, Mrs. Lehman.

1379
01:02:22,755 --> 01:02:24,720
Oh my god, wait, a camera.

1380
01:02:24,722 --> 01:02:26,992
This place is a dump,
there's nothing to steal.

1381
01:02:27,793 --> 01:02:29,528
They're not watching the house.

1382
01:02:30,262 --> 01:02:31,430
They're watching us.

1383
01:02:35,467 --> 01:02:39,668
Norma, it's Jack and
Elaine, Max's friends.

1384
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:40,938
Can we come in?

1385
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:44,441
We're looking for car
keys, to Sylvia's car.

1386
01:02:44,443 --> 01:02:45,678
Do you mind if we...

1387
01:02:46,612 --> 01:02:48,043
Oh.

1388
01:02:48,045 --> 01:02:50,613
Norma, sorry to wake you.

1389
01:02:50,615 --> 01:02:53,052
Do you have the keys
to Sylvia's car?

1390
01:02:54,485 --> 01:02:56,254
Oh no, no, don't get up, we can.

1391
01:02:58,389 --> 01:03:00,224
Oh shit, holy shit.

1392
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:02,891
What the fuck, is she dead?

1393
01:03:02,893 --> 01:03:03,695
Norma?

1394
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:09,601
Norma?

1395
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:15,206
Oh fuck, what the fuck?

1396
01:03:15,507 --> 01:03:16,639
Out, out!

1397
01:03:16,641 --> 01:03:19,177
Out out out now,
get out now, now!

1398
01:03:27,753 --> 01:03:29,221
I found another one.

1399
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:38,798
Fuck.

1400
01:03:48,005 --> 01:03:49,104
Found one.

1401
01:03:49,106 --> 01:03:51,141
Over the sink, sick fucks.

1402
01:03:51,143 --> 01:03:53,342
Points directly at the toilet.

1403
01:03:53,344 --> 01:03:54,476
Hah, they asked for it.

1404
01:03:54,478 --> 01:03:56,112
You put a camera
in the bathroom,

1405
01:03:56,114 --> 01:03:57,583
you're gonna see some shit.

1406
01:04:09,661 --> 01:04:10,459
Oh, come on!

1407
01:04:10,461 --> 01:04:11,797
- Hey!
- Open up!

1408
01:04:15,266 --> 01:04:16,801
What the hell, dude?

1409
01:04:24,909 --> 01:04:26,278
Hello?

1410
01:04:32,217 --> 01:04:34,420
Are you watching or playing?

1411
01:04:35,721 --> 01:04:37,655
'Cause either way,
you're paying.

1412
01:05:03,514 --> 01:05:05,850
Hello, anybody home?

1413
01:05:13,425 --> 01:05:15,494
You don't seem
particularly concerned.

1414
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,764
Norma's been going downhill
for a very long time now.

1415
01:05:20,766 --> 01:05:23,465
Well, there's nothing I can do
until the phone lines are up.

1416
01:05:23,467 --> 01:05:25,334
What about the rat massacre?

1417
01:05:25,336 --> 01:05:27,369
It's hardly a massacre.

1418
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:29,741
Maisy used to
kill one rat a day.

1419
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:34,075
Well, it's not my job to
monitor my husband's work,

1420
01:05:34,077 --> 01:05:35,512
strange as it is.

1421
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:37,046
Then what's with
all the cameras?

1422
01:05:37,048 --> 01:05:38,780
Oh, Max got nervous.

1423
01:05:38,782 --> 01:05:41,383
He received a bunch
of phone calls

1424
01:05:41,385 --> 01:05:43,552
and threatening emails.

1425
01:05:43,554 --> 01:05:45,487
This place is wired like
the fucking White House.

1426
01:05:45,489 --> 01:05:47,490
He was afraid he
was being targeted.

1427
01:05:47,492 --> 01:05:49,094
By scientists?

1428
01:05:49,393 --> 01:05:52,061
I wouldn't expect
you to understand.

1429
01:05:52,063 --> 01:05:53,731
Where are Paul and Larry?

1430
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:56,099
They're not with you?

1431
01:05:56,101 --> 01:05:57,403
Where's Max?

1432
01:05:58,369 --> 01:06:00,135
Max is dead, Jack.

1433
01:06:00,137 --> 01:06:01,406
You sure about that?

1434
01:06:03,108 --> 01:06:04,777
I don't have to listen to this.

1435
01:06:06,677 --> 01:06:07,778
You do, if you ever wanna see

1436
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:09,244
your creepy ass footage again.

1437
01:06:09,246 --> 01:06:10,214
Amber?

1438
01:06:10,414 --> 01:06:11,617
I got 'em.

1439
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:14,950
Good, so you tell us
where Paul and Larry are,

1440
01:06:14,952 --> 01:06:17,586
why Max's corpse
keeps showing up,

1441
01:06:17,588 --> 01:06:21,557
or Amber burns every
memory card in this house.

1442
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:23,760
Oh, it's Max's project.

1443
01:06:23,762 --> 01:06:25,896
I don't particularly care.

1444
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,630
Although I'm sure it's
exactly what he would

1445
01:06:27,632 --> 01:06:29,434
have expected of you.

1446
01:06:29,668 --> 01:06:31,501
Not me, he didn't know me.

1447
01:06:31,503 --> 01:06:34,506
Well he didn't need to,
you're kind of obvious.

1448
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:40,578
You see, human nature
never disappoints.

1449
01:06:43,282 --> 01:06:45,017
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

1450
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,117
Follow me.

1451
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:49,019
No, no, no, no.

1452
01:06:50,054 --> 01:06:51,487
Well I can't really
explain it to you.

1453
01:06:51,489 --> 01:06:52,889
I wouldn't do it justice.

1454
01:06:52,891 --> 01:06:53,755
Try.

1455
01:06:53,757 --> 01:06:56,261
But I know just the one who can.

1456
01:06:57,494 --> 01:06:59,597
If we're not back in
15 minutes, burn them.

1457
01:07:24,322 --> 01:07:26,055
Oh my god, Larry?

1458
01:07:26,057 --> 01:07:27,123
What the hell, Max?

1459
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:28,659
Please, please don't touch them.

1460
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:32,262
These are consenting
adults, albeit implied.

1461
01:07:32,264 --> 01:07:33,563
Jesus, what the hell?

1462
01:07:33,565 --> 01:07:34,532
I said don't touch them!

1463
01:07:35,699 --> 01:07:36,932
Whoah, I don't believe this.

1464
01:07:36,934 --> 01:07:39,336
Sylvia, Sylvia,
put down the gun.

1465
01:07:39,771 --> 01:07:42,539
I'm sorry, that
doesn't feel right.

1466
01:07:43,273 --> 01:07:45,007
Now Max would explain everything

1467
01:07:45,009 --> 01:07:49,244
but our creative differences
have rendered him speechless.

1468
01:07:49,246 --> 01:07:50,412
So, I will.

1469
01:07:50,414 --> 01:07:51,981
Oh Sylvia, please, can we just...

1470
01:07:51,983 --> 01:07:52,951
Back the fuck up!

1471
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,588
Back the fuck up.

1472
01:07:58,489 --> 01:08:00,555
Now if he could
speak, Max would say

1473
01:08:00,557 --> 01:08:01,925
he had no choice.

1474
01:08:01,927 --> 01:08:04,427
An unfinished study
is a worthless one

1475
01:08:04,429 --> 01:08:08,565
and I promised him that we
would finish it together.

1476
01:08:08,567 --> 01:08:10,900
But I'm all about the art.

1477
01:08:10,902 --> 01:08:13,536
And he's all about the science

1478
01:08:13,538 --> 01:08:16,005
which does get annoying.

1479
01:08:16,007 --> 01:08:17,406
Sylvia, come on.

1480
01:08:17,408 --> 01:08:18,607
It's a damn college study!

1481
01:08:22,146 --> 01:08:23,146
What the fuck?!

1482
01:08:23,148 --> 01:08:24,516
Shit, Sylvia!

1483
01:08:26,216 --> 01:08:30,822
So uh, we've had to give
each other a little space.

1484
01:08:31,555 --> 01:08:33,024
Healthy in any marriage.

1485
01:08:35,293 --> 01:08:36,362
Shut up, Max.

1486
01:08:37,895 --> 01:08:38,764
Hey.

1487
01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:47,072
Did you guys know
that in World War II

1488
01:08:47,972 --> 01:08:51,840
only 25 percent of soldiers
actually fired their weapons

1489
01:08:51,842 --> 01:08:54,678
at an exposed enemy soldier?

1490
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,746
Our mammalian brains,
our dog brains

1491
01:08:57,748 --> 01:08:59,281
kept getting in the way.

1492
01:08:59,283 --> 01:09:01,616
Reluctance to kill one
of our own species,

1493
01:09:01,618 --> 01:09:03,586
can you believe that?

1494
01:09:03,588 --> 01:09:05,724
What a waste of
government spending.

1495
01:09:05,957 --> 01:09:07,190
I'm very uncomfortable
right now.

1496
01:09:07,192 --> 01:09:08,691
-Quiet!

1497
01:09:08,693 --> 01:09:12,829
Stimulate that amygdala
enough, that fear center,

1498
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:16,766
follow it up with a little
loathing, make it personal,

1499
01:09:16,768 --> 01:09:19,304
and that little dog
brain just goes to sleep.

1500
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:23,106
Just a little nap, just long
enough to pull the trigger

1501
01:09:23,108 --> 01:09:24,473
and then, <i>voila!,</i>

1502
01:09:24,475 --> 01:09:28,345
your ordinary citizen
becomes an instant soldier.

1503
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,848
As you can see Jack, it's not
just a damn college study.

1504
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:35,751
This is a potentially game
changing tactic of war!

1505
01:09:35,753 --> 01:09:37,452
That's really fucked up.

1506
01:09:37,454 --> 01:09:38,524
Isn't it?

1507
01:09:40,225 --> 01:09:43,159
But no ending, no cash.

1508
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:46,996
So Max's friends were
the obvious choice.

1509
01:09:46,998 --> 01:09:51,336
The perfect petri dish of
boring middle class America.

1510
01:09:51,636 --> 01:09:54,103
Just give us our
friend and we will go.

1511
01:09:54,105 --> 01:09:54,972
Which friend?

1512
01:09:55,672 --> 01:09:56,974
You can only have one.

1513
01:09:58,042 --> 01:10:00,477
Shut up, Jesus, I cannot think

1514
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:02,611
with you moaning all the time!

1515
01:10:03,914 --> 01:10:04,981
Hey, hey, hey, what did I say,

1516
01:10:04,983 --> 01:10:06,249
what did I say?

1517
01:10:06,251 --> 01:10:08,250
If it was up to you we
would still be on the web

1518
01:10:08,252 --> 01:10:11,019
searching for fucking zip ties.

1519
01:10:11,021 --> 01:10:12,120
Now shut it!

1520
01:10:12,122 --> 01:10:13,990
Sylvia, you don't
need to do this.

1521
01:10:13,992 --> 01:10:15,858
This is Max's fucked up thing.

1522
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:17,994
I mean you're like the real
deal, you do documentaries.

1523
01:10:17,996 --> 01:10:20,731
No one funds
documentaries anymore.

1524
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:23,799
Unless they're about
orphans in Sudan

1525
01:10:23,801 --> 01:10:26,103
or fat people in America!

1526
01:10:27,104 --> 01:10:29,472
Max was in on all
of this of course.

1527
01:10:31,443 --> 01:10:34,079
Hey!

1528
01:10:36,046 --> 01:10:36,914
Until now.

1529
01:10:38,884 --> 01:10:42,520
This is where we
part ways, creatively.

1530
01:10:43,354 --> 01:10:44,188
Max?

1531
01:10:45,556 --> 01:10:48,424
And literally too, I suppose.

1532
01:10:48,426 --> 01:10:49,659
Yo, Max, are you...?

1533
01:10:49,661 --> 01:10:51,227
Guess I don't know
my own strength.

1534
01:10:51,229 --> 01:10:53,696
Well, it's time to put
it to some good use.

1535
01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:54,865
Shit, man!

1536
01:10:55,832 --> 01:10:58,401
Ooh, I might have to
make that hole bigger.

1537
01:10:58,403 --> 01:10:59,771
Oh come on, Sylvia.

1538
01:11:00,706 --> 01:11:02,772
If you kill us,
your project's dead.

1539
01:11:02,774 --> 01:11:05,040
You're just part of the story.

1540
01:11:05,042 --> 01:11:07,311
You're ultimately dispensable.

1541
01:11:07,712 --> 01:11:09,144
No, no, no, if we're not back,

1542
01:11:09,146 --> 01:11:11,112
Bess and Amber are gonna
burn all the footage.

1543
01:11:11,114 --> 01:11:13,316
You really think
they'll still be there?

1544
01:11:13,318 --> 01:11:14,186
Yeah I do.

1545
01:11:16,054 --> 01:11:16,922
You would.

1546
01:11:17,921 --> 01:11:20,255
You are relentlessly optimistic

1547
01:11:20,257 --> 01:11:24,461
for someone with such
a sad little life.

1548
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:26,329
Oh no.

1549
01:11:26,331 --> 01:11:28,199
Oh I didn't say that,
he did.

1550
01:11:30,702 --> 01:11:32,671
Now's your chance
to get him back.

1551
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:36,104
Get up!

1552
01:11:36,106 --> 01:11:38,741
- Oh shit!
- Hey, hey!

1553
01:11:38,743 --> 01:11:40,812
Get the fuck up before I
kill off your character!

1554
01:11:45,582 --> 01:11:47,552
Still gotta have an ending.

1555
01:12:06,171 --> 01:12:08,707
So, here's the deal.

1556
01:12:10,442 --> 01:12:14,943
One of you could run and
have a 10 percent chance

1557
01:12:14,945 --> 01:12:16,413
of making it out that door.

1558
01:12:17,414 --> 01:12:20,083
If all of you run
at the same time,

1559
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:22,919
your odds go up to
40, maybe 50 percent

1560
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:26,121
but the odds that I
shoot your pal Larry here

1561
01:12:26,123 --> 01:12:28,827
at close range are 100 percent.

1562
01:12:29,793 --> 01:12:32,728
So you might live
but your friend

1563
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:34,666
will most certainly
die, up to you.

1564
01:12:44,108 --> 01:12:46,744
Oh, well, you're
eyeing the exit.

1565
01:12:47,712 --> 01:12:49,014
And who can blame you?

1566
01:12:50,981 --> 01:12:52,680
No sense in risking your life

1567
01:12:52,682 --> 01:12:57,288
for someone who wouldn't even
hail you a cab in the rain.

1568
01:12:59,524 --> 01:13:00,859
You're crazy.

1569
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,960
Well, look around you.

1570
01:13:04,962 --> 01:13:06,765
It's all relative.

1571
01:13:08,733 --> 01:13:10,268
You're on the fence.

1572
01:13:11,301 --> 01:13:13,102
Oh, I can tell.

1573
01:13:13,104 --> 01:13:16,671
He's a dick of a friend, but,

1574
01:13:16,673 --> 01:13:20,375
you're really in no condition
to make any new ones.

1575
01:13:20,377 --> 01:13:23,745
Huh, I'd say misery
loves company

1576
01:13:23,747 --> 01:13:26,348
but you see your sad little life

1577
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:29,218
is the only thing keeping
his sad little life

1578
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:32,790
from seeming
comparatively less sad.

1579
01:13:36,327 --> 01:13:39,861
You really wanna sacrifice
yourself to someone

1580
01:13:39,863 --> 01:13:41,130
who's sitting here thinking

1581
01:13:41,132 --> 01:13:42,800
at least I'm not you.

1582
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,867
That's nice Larry,
that's really nice.

1583
01:13:47,305 --> 01:13:48,807
But not you, Jack.

1584
01:13:49,506 --> 01:13:50,873
You never liked Larry.

1585
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:52,541
He never let you forget

1586
01:13:52,543 --> 01:13:55,143
that he was a lawyer, and you
were selling phone bundles

1587
01:13:55,145 --> 01:13:56,880
to housewives in the valley.

1588
01:13:57,849 --> 01:13:59,883
You make in a week what
he makes in an hour,

1589
01:13:59,885 --> 01:14:01,450
I mean that has gotta be hard.

1590
01:14:01,452 --> 01:14:05,053
Guys like Larry are what's
wrong with this world,

1591
01:14:05,055 --> 01:14:07,690
taking your jobs,
your girlfriends,

1592
01:14:07,692 --> 01:14:10,025
maybe it's time
to take them back!

1593
01:14:12,896 --> 01:14:14,296
Hey, hey, hey.

1594
01:14:14,298 --> 01:14:16,400
It is not your turn to speak.

1595
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:26,744
Well, I mean, come on.

1596
01:14:31,047 --> 01:14:35,086
I think we all knew that
Connecticut thing wouldn't last.

1597
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,122
You're hanging on
by a small thread

1598
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:44,760
just calculating, how much
more therapy you'll need

1599
01:14:44,762 --> 01:14:47,263
to get over the latest trauma

1600
01:14:47,265 --> 01:14:48,865
and how much guilt
you should feel

1601
01:14:48,867 --> 01:14:50,933
for refusing to fuck
Larry in the kitchen

1602
01:14:50,935 --> 01:14:53,802
last night for old time's sake.

1603
01:14:53,804 --> 01:14:54,702
Jesus, Bess.

1604
01:14:54,704 --> 01:14:56,004
What do you care?

1605
01:14:56,006 --> 01:14:57,673
She has a point.

1606
01:14:57,675 --> 01:14:58,877
Yeah.

1607
01:15:01,945 --> 01:15:04,280
I mean we may as
well clear the air

1608
01:15:04,282 --> 01:15:06,284
while we're all
still breathing it.

1609
01:15:24,202 --> 01:15:25,070
So.

1610
01:15:26,671 --> 01:15:31,009
Kill or be killed, my
little lab rodents.

1611
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:33,010
You choose.

1612
01:16:01,238 --> 01:16:03,540
Fascinating!

1613
01:16:04,676 --> 01:16:07,543
Ah, you think the
outcome would be obvious!

1614
01:16:07,545 --> 01:16:12,382
But the D.O.D. do love to
have the numbers crunched!

1615
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:17,087
Oh, I almost wish Max
was here to see this!

1616
01:16:20,358 --> 01:16:25,529
But my film will finally
show our work, my work,

1617
01:16:26,029 --> 01:16:27,264
to the world!

1618
01:16:28,699 --> 01:16:32,903
All I need now is
the perfect ending.

1619
01:16:40,711 --> 01:16:44,412
And there's nothing
more final than fire.

1620
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:22,019
All right, all right.

1621
01:17:23,621 --> 01:17:25,021
Paul, Paul.

1622
01:17:25,023 --> 01:17:26,455
Ma'am, you're
gonna have to stay back.

1623
01:17:26,457 --> 01:17:27,589
No, no, no
you don't understand,

1624
01:17:27,591 --> 01:17:28,790
there's been a mistake.

1625
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:29,892
Ma'am I don't
have to understand,

1626
01:17:29,894 --> 01:17:31,160
that's not my job.

1627
01:17:31,162 --> 01:17:32,628
No, but you can't
just...

1628
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:34,097
Ma'am I'm gonna
ask you one more time.

1629
01:17:34,099 --> 01:17:35,031
He's a therapist,
he's a pacifist!

1630
01:17:35,033 --> 01:17:36,665
With a loaded gun.

1631
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:38,134
Paul would never
hurt anyone, that's not him.

1632
01:17:38,136 --> 01:17:39,434
It isn't
till it is, ma'am.

1633
01:17:39,436 --> 01:17:41,372
They don't walk
around wearing a sign.

1634
01:17:42,872 --> 01:17:44,740
Ah, it's a shame too.

1635
01:17:44,742 --> 01:17:46,244
She was a real nice lady.

1636
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:48,477
This is all wrong, okay?

1637
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:51,446
He's not, he's the
one who's unstable.

1638
01:17:51,448 --> 01:17:53,080
Well I'm not a doctor, ma'am.

1639
01:17:53,082 --> 01:17:54,517
I don't diagnose.

1640
01:17:54,519 --> 01:17:57,152
But you're all
consenting adults.

1641
01:17:57,154 --> 01:17:58,487
And if you don't
want to participate,

1642
01:17:58,489 --> 01:18:00,423
you shouldn't sign the waiver.

1643
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:01,259
The what?

1644
01:18:09,867 --> 01:18:11,334
Weaponizing fear.

1645
01:18:11,336 --> 01:18:12,968
A comprehensive study
of the effects of fear

1646
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:15,003
on the human brain.

1647
01:18:15,005 --> 01:18:16,474
Sound familiar?

1648
01:18:17,975 --> 01:18:19,741
These your signature?

1649
01:18:19,743 --> 01:18:21,477
I didn't sign that.

1650
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:24,548
Ah, at least someone's got
some brains around here.

1651
01:18:25,483 --> 01:18:27,316
The things people do
for money these days.

1652
01:18:27,318 --> 01:18:28,750
Okay folks.

1653
01:18:28,752 --> 01:18:30,956
We'll give you a ride
down to the station.

1654
01:18:32,823 --> 01:18:34,022
Max.

1655
01:18:34,024 --> 01:18:35,458
Hey Max!

1656
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,162
Yeah, what the fuck, man?

1657
01:18:39,096 --> 01:18:40,929
They'll take your
statements in town.

1658
01:18:40,931 --> 01:18:42,196
Let's go.

1659
01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:43,598
No wait, no, no, no, wait wait.

1660
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,134
What about that kid,
that student, you know,

1661
01:18:45,136 --> 01:18:46,768
he freaked out, he
disappeared, and...

1662
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:48,169
Dropped out of college.

1663
01:18:48,171 --> 01:18:49,306
Say it ain't so.

1664
01:18:50,108 --> 01:18:51,339
I mean, but look at him,

1665
01:18:51,341 --> 01:18:52,307
his wife is dead,
he's not even...

1666
01:18:52,309 --> 01:18:53,275
Who, Professor Lehman?

1667
01:18:53,277 --> 01:18:54,677
Ex Professor Lehman.

1668
01:18:54,679 --> 01:18:56,812
No ma'am, he still
works at the university.

1669
01:18:56,814 --> 01:18:59,647
He runs that psychology
department or something.

1670
01:18:59,649 --> 01:19:01,384
And he'll be the first
to tell you...

1671
01:19:01,918 --> 01:19:04,989
Crazy always finds its way out.

1672
