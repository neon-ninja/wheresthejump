1
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,651
Ow.

2
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:17,473
Should pale death with treble dread
make the ocean caves our bed,

3
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:22,682
god who hear'st the surges roll,
deign to save our suppliant soul.

4
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,856
To four weeks.

5
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,026
No, sir. Thank you.

6
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,446
It's bad luck to leave
a toast unfinished, lad.

7
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,365
Oh, meanin'... meanin' no disrespect.

8
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,741
Man what don't drink
best have his reasons.

9
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,202
Uh... ain'tit... I...

10
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,503
I... I understood
it's against regulations, sir...

11
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,625
Did you?

12
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,874
I did, sir. From, uh...
From them's manual.

13
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,256
Didn't picture you a readin' man.

14
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,132
Well, I ain't trying for trouble.

15
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,683
Then you'll do as I say.

16
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,052
That's in your book too.

17
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,805
To four weeks.

18
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,571
Aye. Aye. The cistern needs a-lookin' to.

19
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:57,321
One of your duties, lad.
Or didn't y'read yourself about it?

20
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:01,951
You'll clean the brass and the clockwork,
and you'll tidy up the quarters after.

21
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,792
And there's well more
to be mended outside.

22
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,914
D'you hear me, lad?

23
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,413
Yes, sir.

24
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,507
Aye, sir!

25
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,004
Aye, sir.

26
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,686
When the fog clears,
you'll work through the dog watch.

27
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,647
Doggin' it?

28
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,817
I was 'specting I'd get up
to see the lantern.

29
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,905
I tend the light.

30
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,232
Well, the rules is alternatin' shifts.

31
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:42,321
It's the mid-watch that's to dread, lad.
My watch, night to morning.

32
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,825
Some new junior man I'm fixed with.

33
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,295
See to your duties. The light is mine.

34
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,077
Son of a bitch!

35
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,163
Shingles.

36
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,492
Tend to 'em after the cistern.

37
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,331
And the lamp, she needs oil.

38
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,884
Aye, sir.

39
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,931
Go!

40
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,057
Move it.

41
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,047
You don't go in there!

42
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,383
- Qil, sir.
- Tired? Use this next time.

43
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,932
Save you a hell of a lot of trouble.

44
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,222
Catch your breath, lad.

45
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,279
I said, catch your breath, lad.

46
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,410
Then bring that drum back down
the ladder well where y'found it.

47
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,369
'Less you're fixin'
to burn the whole light down.

48
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,375
Then see to the rest of your duties.
You're behindhand already.

49
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,216
Aye, sir.
You're too slow. You a dullard?

50
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,635
No, sir.

51
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,966
Fooled me.

52
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:04,151
Should pale death with treble dread
make the ocean caves our bed,

53
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:09,330
god who hear'st the surges roll,
deign to save the suppliant soul.

54
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,209
Still tastes o'the head?

55
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:28,766
Ah, find some chirk in ye, lad.
Now is the time for gab and chatter.

56
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,934
Y'best be enjoying it.

57
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,683
Come a fortnight,
and the brace of us'll be wantin'

58
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,311
to be ever silent as the tomb.

59
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,604
I ain't much for talkin'.

60
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,898
Reckon you're the first?

61
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,064
No, sir. I don't.

62
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,159
Y'ain't.

63
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,859
Y'ain't.

64
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:53,124
The chicopee, a fine-un she were.

65
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,410
Clean-built and trig-lookin'.

66
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,377
None more fleet in '64 than she.

67
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,216
We were on the breaks.

68
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,302
A mutiny, it were.

69
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,838
And why, ask ye? Why?

70
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:13,516
What's the terrible part
of a sailor's life, ask ye, lad?

71
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,644
"Tis when the work stops
when you're twixt wind and water."

72
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:22,354
Doldrums. Doldrums. Eviler than the devil.

73
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:27,363
Boredom makes men to villains,
and the water goes quick, lad, vanished.

74
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,448
The only med'cine is drink.

75
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,284
Keeps them sailors happy,
keeps 'em agreeable,

76
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,959
keeps 'em calm, keeps "em..."

77
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,127
Stupid.

78
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:50,640
Curse me if there ain't an old tar spirit
somewheres in ye, lad.

79
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,900
Out with it, lad.

80
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,193
Uh...

81
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:09,117
What, uh...
What made your last keeper leave?

82
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,739
Him? Me second?

83
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,911
Mm-hmm.

84
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Died.

85
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,784
Went mad, he did.

86
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:23,126
Ravin' about sirens, merfolk,
bad omens and the like.

87
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:28,879
In the end, weren't no more sense left
in him than an hen's tooth.

88
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:34,012
He believed that there was
some enchantment in the light.

89
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:40,143
He notioned that St. elmo
had cast his very fire into it.

90
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,187
Salvation, said he.

91
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:57,991
Tall tales.

92
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,415
I seen ye sparrin' with a gull.

93
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,633
Best leave 'em be.

94
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,096
Bad luck to kill a seabird.

95
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,924
More tall tales.

96
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,053
Bad luck to kill a seabird!

97
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,781
Pay me no mind, lad.

98
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,577
None.

99
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,029
Fix us up some coffee.

100
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,744
Long night ahead.

101
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:44,044
Drop o'coffee will do us good.

102
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,621
You've been neglecting your duties, lad!

103
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,633
Don't deny it!

104
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,677
What do you call that?

105
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,422
Sir? “What?

106
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,804
I... I mopped and swept twice over, sir.

107
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,102
Ye lyin' dog.

108
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,440
- I swept 'em.
- 'Tis begrimed and bedabbled.

109
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,109
Unwiped, unwashed, and distained.

110
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,609
You get some kinda peart
outta molestin' me?

111
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,940
Come now?

112
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,412
I already says...

113
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,328
How dare ye contradict me, y'dog.

114
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,498
Now look here,
I ain't never intended to be no housewife

115
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,371
nor slave in takin' this job.

116
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,792
It ain't right.

117
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:35,458
These lodgings is more ramshackle
than any shanty boy's camp I ever seen.

118
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,751
The queen of england's
own fancy housekeeper

119
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,365
couldn't even done no better
than what I done,

120
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,472
'cause I tell you, I scrubbed
this here place twice over, sir...

121
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,515
And I say y'did nothin' o'the sort.

122
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:49,268
And I say y'swab it again,
and y'swab it proper-like this time,

123
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,850
and you'll be swabbin' it
ten times more after that.

124
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,069
And if I tells ye to pull up and apart

125
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,772
every floorboard and clapboard
of this here house

126
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,109
and scour 'em down with your bare,
bleedin' knuckles, you'll do it!

127
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,079
And if I tells ye to yank out
every single nail

128
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:11,001
from every molderin' nail-hole
and suck off every speck of rust

129
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:15,502
till all them nails sparkle
like a sperm whale's pecker,

130
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:20,052
and then carpenter the whole light station
back together from scrap,

131
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,926
and then do it all over again,
you'll do it!

132
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,756
And by god and by golly,

133
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:27,093
you'll do it smilin', lad,
'cause you'll like it.

134
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,473
You'll like it 'cause I says you will!

135
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:36,982
Contradict me again,
and I'll dock your wages.

136
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:40,613
D'ye hear me, lad?

137
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,155
Aye, sir.

138
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,445
Ah.

139
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,786
Swab, dog. Swab!

140
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,283
Keep 'em steady, lad!

141
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,580
Aye, sir.

142
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,869
Whitewash must be even, lad.
Bright! Shinin'!

143
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:21,833
Like a silver whorehouse token.
Give them sailors a proper daymark.

144
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,418
They're not going to see it
in a goddamn storm!

145
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,962
Keep your temper now, lad.

146
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:31,517
"Tis fine work. And you're makin'
high marks in me logbook."

147
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,843
Them's gospel.

148
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,471
I'll drop y'down a few feet.

149
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,777
Easy!

150
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,360
Never been in better hands.

151
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,357
Easy!

152
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,316
Quit your flailing, lad.

153
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,027
- I ain't!
- Y'are!

154
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,783
- Keep still!
- I am!

155
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,696
Git! Git! Git! Git!

156
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:03,983
Thank ye, lad.

157
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,732
Winslow.

158
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,860
Ephraim winslow.

159
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,867
These last two weeks, I'd...

160
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,571
I'd like it if you'd call me by my name.

161
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,701
Listen to ye,

162
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,617
giving orders, lad.

163
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,374
- Winslow.
- All right, all right.

164
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,295
Suits me just as fine, Ephraim winslow.

165
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:33,427
So, what brung such a one as ye
to this damned rock?

166
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,591
Such as what?

167
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,718
Pretty as a picture.

168
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,764
Only joshing, lad, only Josh...

169
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,473
- Winslow.
- Winslow.

170
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,147
What brung ye...

171
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,484
To this rock, Ephraim winslow?

172
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,866
What were your work afore?

173
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,283
- Timber.
- Timber?

174
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:06,038
Big timber. Up north. Canada ways.

175
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,624
- Hudson bay outfit?
- The same.

176
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,677
True what they say?
"Forest as far as the eye can see"?

177
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,135
Yes, sir. Spruce, tamarack, white pine.

178
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,259
"Bush," them folk up there call it.

179
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,345
Had enough of trees, that it, then?

180
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,808
Yes, sir.

181
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,935
Can't say I blame ye.

182
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:29,232
I Hearn tell about that life. Hard goin'.

183
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,111
Work one man harder
than two horses, they say.

184
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,321
No, thankee.

185
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:42,537
The sea, she's the only situation
wantin' for me.

186
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,380
Miss it?

187
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,545
Ain't nothing what can touch it.

188
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,156
But I can't...

189
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,466
Be draggin' me old stump about.

190
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,597
Nay. Not worth the trouble.

191
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,429
Now I'm a wickie and a wickie I is.

192
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:07,312
And I'm damn-well wedded
to this here light,

193
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:12,153
and she's been a finer,
truer, quieter wife

194
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,071
than any alive-blooded woman.

195
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,284
You ever married?

196
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,742
Thirteen christmases at sea...

197
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,075
Little 'uns at home.

198
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:27,873
She never forgave it.

199
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,374
"Tis for the better."

200
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:38,381
Since we're getting too friendly,
Ephraim winslow,

201
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:43,344
tell me, what's a timber man
want with being a wickie?

202
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,897
Not enough quiet for ye up north?

203
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,611
Sawdust itching your nethers?

204
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,611
Foreman found ye too high-tempered
for carrying an ax?

205
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:03,239
Like you said,
I just had enough of trees, I guess.

206
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,336
Since I left dad,

207
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,923
I done every kind of work
that can pay a man.

208
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,134
Some I ain't near proud of.

209
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,128
Drifter, en?

210
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,429
No, just...

211
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,263
Can't find a post
I can take a real shine to,

212
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:24,809
so I keep movin' along.

213
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,542
And I ain't the kind to look back
at what's behind him, see.

214
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,601
On the run?

215
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:33,061
Now look here, ain't nothin' wrong
with a man startin' fresh, startin' new,

216
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,340
just lookin' to earn a living.

217
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,900
No.

218
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,114
Just like any man,

219
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,943
just wanna settle down
quiet-like with some earnings.

220
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:46,448
I read someplace
that a man could earn 630 or...

221
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,958
I read $1,000 a year

222
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,536
if he tends a light far off shore.

223
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,088
The further away, the more he earns.

224
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,131
I read that, and hell, I says, work.

225
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:00,929
Save my earnings.

226
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,144
Sometime soon I'll raise my own roof,

227
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,644
somewheres up country,
with no one to tell me what for.

228
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,361
And that's all.

229
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,733
Same old borin' story, eh?

230
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,327
Well, you asked.

231
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,377
Say, why is it bad luck to kill a gull?

232
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:41,303
In 'em's the souls of sailors
what met their maker.

233
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,049
You a prayin' man, winslow?

234
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,308
Not as often as I might.

235
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,890
But I'm god-fearin',
if that's what you're askin'.

236
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,513
Shit.

237
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:33,988
Wind's changed.

238
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,152
Oh. Good riddance.

239
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:39,987
Oh, don't be so darn foolish.
It's the calm afore the storm, winslow.

240
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,995
She were a gentle westerly wind
you're cursin'.

241
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,873
Only feels roughly 'cause you don't know
nothin' about nothin',

242
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:52,003
and there ain't no trees on this here rock
like your Hudson bay bush.

243
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,297
Nor'easterly wind'll come soon

244
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,174
a-blowin' like Gabriel's horn.

245
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,177
Best board up them signal house winders.

246
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,592
- Aye, sir.
- "Twill keep steady

247
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,303
afore the tender comes in the morn,
I 'spect,

248
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,723
but there's dirty weather knockin' about.

249
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,437
Somethin' stirring in ye?

250
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,987
You're gettin' off this rock tomorry,
winslow.

251
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,198
Don't start grudgen me now.

252
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,030
No, sir.

253
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,456
Keeping secrets, are ye?

254
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,295
I could just use a hand
with them boards, is all.

255
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,642
Pull, winslow!

256
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,390
Look at 'em.

257
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,229
Better than fin fishin'.

258
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:06,248
Ain't no crime to take a snort now.
A clear night, and our last afore relief.

259
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:11,332
I ain't never known an inspector
what wouldn't turn a blind eye.

260
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,419
And I won't take no for an answer.

261
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:27,264
Should pale death and treble dread...

262
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,977
Ah, hell. To... to relief.

263
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,979
And how.

264
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,313
Oh!

265
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,924
& hurrah, we're homeward bound j

266
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,093
j hurrah, we're homeward bound! &

267
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,387
> when we're arrived at bedford docks &

268
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,590
j» them bloomers comin' out in flocks &

269
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,051
j them pretty girls
they all did say j

270
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,262
j here comes Jack
with his nine-month pay &

271
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,347
& hurrah, we're homeward bound j

272
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,477
j hurrah, we're homeward bound! &

273
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:18,353
and a pretty lass, she were,
takin' off her bonnet,

274
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:23,066
but as I says, I'd broke me leg,
and banged meself all up.

275
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:26,027
It was to a nuns' hospital.

276
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,489
All of them nuns
were catholics, I tell ye.

277
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:40,713
But I never went to Salem since
without hoping that I should see her,

278
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:45,722
for beddin' down weren't the same since.

279
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,678
You feel shame when you lie with a woman?

280
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,353
I ain't 'shamed of nothing!

281
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,648
Well, I'll say it...

282
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,819
I might even miss ye, Ephraim winslow.

283
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:08,119
You're fastly a true blue wickie

284
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,992
in the making, you is.

285
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:13,199
Thought one night you was bound to
split me skull in twain,

286
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:14,830
but you're a good-un.

287
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,793
Why, you'll be workin' the lamp
in no time.

288
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:20,922
Why haven't 1?

289
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,470
What?

290
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,628
The light.

291
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,520
I'm the keeper of this station, lad.

292
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,689
Some other station, y'can tend the light.

293
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:37,776
The manual says...

294
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,852
- My log is the only book on this rock...
- Since I'm wickie...

295
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,488
I'm the keeper of the light, lad.
I never let no man touch her...

296
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,442
Don't concern yourself
with the beacon, lad!

297
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,571
Mine!

298
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,339
Have it your way.

299
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:14,726
Say, I never...

300
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:18,230
I don't... I don't know your name.

301
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:20,527
W ake.

302
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,068
Your Christian name.

303
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:26,401
Thomas.

304
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:31,285
- Thomas?
- Aye, Thomas wake.

305
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:34,996
Call me Tom.

306
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:44,461
Well...

307
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,799
To my friend Tom.

308
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,223
And gettin' off this goddamn rock.

309
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,434
What are y'splittin' your lungs fer?

310
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,198
You smell o' shit.

311
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,705
Best swab this mess
afore the tender comes.

312
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,998
Do as you're told, lad.
The quarters are dire.

313
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,585
Aye... aye, sir. Aye.

314
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:45,842
They didn't come.

315
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:29,643
The damp's got to the provisions!

316
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:34,192
What?

317
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,689
The damp's got to the provisions!

318
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:00,291
The damp's got to the foodstuffs.
The salt COD is out.

319
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,295
- Out?
- Blasted. Gone to rot.

320
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,681
- Praised be.
- Will you hear me now?

321
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,767
- Hear what?
- That we best be rationing.

322
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,521
- Rationing?
- Insubordinate again?

323
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,937
It's only been one day.

324
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,142
Devil's tail.

325
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:23,530
Look, maybe the tender did come.
We just missed her, is all.

326
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,782
I can take the dory out.

327
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,743
Weeks, winslow. Weeks.

328
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,658
What?

329
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,615
What do you mean, what?

330
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,541
- Weeks?
- Weeks. Aye, weeks.

331
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,536
We slept in. Dead drunk.

332
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,668
It's been weeks ago
since we missed her, winslow.

333
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,509
And I've been askin' ye
to ration for weeks now, too,

334
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,429
but you've kept barking at me
like a mad dog

335
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:50,428
sayin' you can take the dory out.

336
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:53,386
- Now, look here...
- Oh, no. Don't be losing your head now.

337
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:55,721
- This ain't funny.
- No, it ain't.

338
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,976
And I ain't want to be stranded here
with some damn lunatic.

339
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,104
Stranded?

340
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,576
That's what I said.

341
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,701
Why, I thought... I thought you said
relief was coming.

342
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:12,488
If we can wait out the storm.

343
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:16,250
The tender is coming.

344
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:23,216
In '75, oi' striker were marooned here
for seven long months, he was.

345
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:27,928
The storm died on the mainland,
but here, the waters were too rageful

346
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,425
neither to launch nor land.

347
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,267
You're just tryin' to scare me.

348
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,970
Look at ye. Pretendin'.

349
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,935
But ye well know your lot.

350
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:09,629
Dig!

351
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,765
Dig, says I!

352
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:15,895
Dig!

353
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,220
Dig!

354
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,730
There she lies.

355
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,086
Rations.

356
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:51,879
The worst of us
couldn't fend 'gainst the ship rats

357
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:55,182
what gnawed on the soles of our feet.

358
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:03,600
Their legs withered
and turned gangree'nous,

359
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:06,731
every shade of the peacock's tail.

360
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:12,358
Their gums grew swollen,
the color of bone, then to rot.

361
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,903
Tarry blood oozed,

362
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:20,492
teeth droppin' to the deck
with none to hold on to.

363
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:27,297
"Land ho!" Hears I,

364
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:33,008
but only grass on that island.
So we et upon the grass.

365
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:38,388
And 'twas that scurvy
what left me locked ever since.

366
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,813
I thought you said you'd broke it.

367
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,525
Aye?

368
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,149
Your leg.

369
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,569
Catholic nuns and such like.

370
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:52,398
You must've misheard.

371
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:05,286
- I told that dumb bastard...
- Yep. Them eaves be gonners.

372
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,213
"Give me your cant hook," I says to him.

373
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:13,006
But... foreman winslow,

374
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,554
that goddamned canady bastard...

375
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:19,554
- Winslow?
- Always callin' me a dog.

376
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:20,976
A filthy dog.

377
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,645
I'll show you who's a dog.
“Winslow.

378
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,399
- What of him?
- Who, winslow?

379
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,318
The eaves be fallin'...

380
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,488
- He's always raggin' on me.
- Ragging?

381
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:37,864
Like you. Damn fool nonsense.

382
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,161
That's the trouble with ye, winslow.

383
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:45,288
Trouble with you is eatin' grass
without no teeth.

384
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,043
Come now?

385
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:53,584
Your sea Matey's teeth had fallen out.

386
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,259
What are ye gettin' at, winslow?

387
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:03,059
Ah. Well, it just seems powerful hard

388
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:08,731
to eat grass with no teeth.

389
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:13,361
'Cause goats and sheeps and cows,

390
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:17,908
well, now, they all got teeth, don't they?

391
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:24,290
Y'know how y'eat grass without your teeth?

392
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,288
Oblige me.

393
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:29,711
Ye rip it out and ye swallow it.

394
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,800
"You rip it out and you swallow it."

395
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:40,972
- Ye rip it out...
- I don't know 'bout that.

396
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:42,977
Y'don't?

397
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,430
I don't.

398
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,323
What?

399
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,702
What?

400
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,457
What?

401
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:11,996
What?

402
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,872
What?

403
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,173
- What?
- What?

404
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,375
- What?
- What?

405
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:17,470
- What?
- What?

406
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,554
- What?
- What?

407
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,638
- What?
- What?

408
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:20,758
- What?
- What?

409
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,840
What?

410
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:25,642
- That's what I mean!
- W hat?

411
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,391
That's the trouble with you.

412
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:29,562
That's the trouble with ye!

413
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,764
- With you!
- With ye!

414
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:33,521
No! No!

415
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,736
I want a steak!

416
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,489
I want a goddamned steak!

417
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,816
I...

418
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:43,698
If I had a steak... oh, boy.

419
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:46,656
A... a rare, a bloody steak.

420
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,036
If I... if I had a steak,

421
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,584
I would fuck it.

422
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:58,880
You don't like me cookin'?

423
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,756
Ugh, don't be such an old bitch!

424
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,923
You're drunk!
You don't know what you're talkin'.

425
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:08,602
How could I possibly like
the horseshit you fix us for supper?

426
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:11,725
You're drunk,
or ye wouldn't be saying that!

427
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:14,809
Them tin kitchen shanty cooks
gave us fried doughnuts three times a day

428
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:17,381
and country ham bigger than your fist.
You're drunk! You're drunk! You're drunk!

429
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,612
- I'm drunk? I...
- You heard me!

430
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,898
- You've been drunk...
- Damn ye!

431
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,780
Drunk since I first laid eyes on you.

432
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,157
You're fond of me lobster, ain't ye?

433
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,197
You're drunker than a virginy fence.

434
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,705
I seen it. You're fond of me lobster.

435
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,795
Say it.

436
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:38,882
Say it.

437
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,255
Say it!

438
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,878
I don't have to say nothin'.

439
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,134
Damn ye!

440
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:49,764
Let Neptune strike ye dead, winslow!

441
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,722
Hark!

442
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:57,814
Hark, triton, hark!

443
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,816
Bellow, bid our father, the sea king,

444
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:08,324
rise from the depths,
full foul in his fury,

445
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:11,953
black waves teeming with salt-foam,

446
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:16,628
to smother this young mouth
with pungent slime,

447
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:22,676
to choke ye, engorging your organs
till ye turn blue and bloated

448
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:26,300
with bilge and brine
and can scream no more.

449
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:31,260
Only when he, crowned in cockle shells

450
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:36,098
with slithering tentacled tail
and steaming beard,

451
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:40,277
take up his fell, be-finned arm,

452
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,025
his coral-tined trident screeches,

453
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,653
banshee-like in the tempest,

454
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:48,827
and plunges right through your gullet,

455
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:55,333
bursting ye, a bulging bladder no more,

456
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,207
but a blasted bloody film now,

457
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:03,418
a nothing for the harpies
and the souls of dead sailors

458
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,344
to peck and claw and feed upon,

459
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:11,767
only to be lapped up and swallowed
by the infinite waters

460
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,890
of the dread emperor himself,

461
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,931
forgotten to any man,

462
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,150
to any time,

463
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:26,653
forgotten to any god or devil,
forgotten even to the sea,

464
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:33,535
for any stuff or part of winslow,
even any scantling of your soul,

465
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:36,458
is winslow no more,

466
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:41,208
but is now itself the sea.

467
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,302
All right. Have it your way.

468
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:52,851
I like your cooking.

469
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:21,767
Son of a bitch.

470
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:49,560
Queer way to wear your shoes.

471
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,156
Just didn't wanna wake you, is all.

472
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,115
It's a long night.

473
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:02,864
And such.

474
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,746
Hmm. The sun is over the yardarm.

475
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:10,331
Best find some winks
afore the day draws farther on.

476
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:19,014
Get back to your duties
or I'll give you a real keelhauling.

477
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,237
You ain't even human no more.

478
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:38,449
"Workin" apart from folks so long.

479
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,390
You're only tolerable when you're drunk.

480
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,154
Get to work, says I.

481
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:45,248
To work!

482
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:51,726

Aye.

Get off me! Get off me!

509
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,396
- Thomas.
- Aye.

510
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,854
- It's Thomas.
- Aye.

511
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,316
No, I'm Thomas.

512
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:14,531
I'm Thomas. You're Ephraim.

513
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,614
I lied.

514
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:21,242
Well, I'll be scuppered.

515
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:26,255
I'm Thomas. Tommy.

516
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:30,547
Tommy? Tommy winslow.

517
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,258
No. Tom Howard.

518
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:35,969
What's winslow?

519
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,850
- It's nothing.
- Nothing?

520
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:44,899
Can I trust you?

521
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:49,103
Don't be spilling any of your beans to me.

522
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:50,817
I ain't interested.

523
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,445
No. It wasn't that way, is all...
Just, see...

524
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:56,243
I see what you're fixin' to do.
You get me all liquored up...

525
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:59,322
Your guilty conscience
is ever as tiresome-borin'

526
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,624
as any a guilty conscience.

527
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:04,122
- Who...
- Worse. Worse.

528
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,704
It was... it was a drive, see.

529
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:11,919
It was a log drive,
and he... he's raggin' on me.

530
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:16,423
No, I see what you're doing.

531
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:17,517
Nothing.

532
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:24,765
Look, Tom, don't be working
to twist words out of my head.

533
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:26,019
I ain't.

534
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:30,027
Um, I can't... I can't do it. I can't...

535
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:32,821
Shut up your own rag box.

536
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:38,282
I trust... I trust... I trust you.

537
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:39,578
No.

538
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:44,292
I... I trust you, Tom.

539
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:46,623
You trust me?

540
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:53,217
No, I don't trust you at all.

541
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,947
And I had 'im handy and helpless.

542
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:20,577
Alone.

543
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,748
Too far downstream.

544
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:30,504
And I... I wanted to do 'im in.
I admit I did.

545
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:35,752
Seein' the back of his head.

546
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:40,765
One swipe of the cant hook'd be all.

547
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,764
Uh... it was...

548
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,643
I... 1 didn't...

549
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:51,434
I didn't... I did not.

550
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:57,948
The day was long as hell on that drive.

551
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:01,653
I was lead-tired. I admit it.

552
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,577
But I saw him slippin', not me.

553
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:09,373
We saw the jam comin'.

554
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,921
I stood and he slipped.

555
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:17,964
He shouted up.
And I... I just stood there.

556
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,677
"Tom, you dog!"

557
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:27,512
I just stood there, is all. Just...

558
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:33,276
Just stood and watched 'im
get swallowed by them logs.

559
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:39,235
And all I could think
when he was done was,

560
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,910
"I... I could use me a smoke."

561
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:45,829
That's it.

562
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:52,586
So, I packed up his kit and fixin's,
as if they was my own and...

563
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:57,417
Ephraim winslow, well, now,
he got a spiffy clean slate.

564
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:01,762
And Thomas Howard, well, he don't.

565
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,715
No prospects.

566
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:11,354
How else am I gonna find respectable work?

567
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,229
Tom!

568
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:24,117
Tom!

569
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:39,004
Why'd y'spill your beans, Tommy?

570
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:53,597
Why'd y'spill your beans?

571
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:02,778
Why'd y'spill your beans?

572
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

573
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:26,858
Don't leave me!

574
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:06,442
You crazy son of a bitch!
You smashed up the lifeboat!

575
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:09,116
You're abandoning your post!

576
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,208
What're you gonna do?
Send for the lighthouse establishment?

577
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:27,419
Certain, says I. I'll report ye,
I'll bring the inspector up.

578
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:30,630
I'll report you! I know what you done.

579
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:35,935
Who's reportin' who?
Ephraim winslow? Or Thomas Howard?

580
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,186
I know what you done.

581
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:39,605
You killed your second.

582
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,644
Your one-eyed junior man.

583
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:51,155
I found him. In the lobster pot.

584
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:54,782
Said he went mad?

585
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,583
You made him mad with that charm!

586
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:02,328
That scrimshaw trinket.

587
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:06,795
But I broke it, see. See?

588
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,804
Now I'm free. I'm free from your designs!

589
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:19,140
And I got it all figured out,

590
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:23,144
'cept what's the secret mischief
your keepin' up there!

591
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:28,066
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Tommy.

592
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:33,318
Last night you made a confession
'twould make a Saint swear.

593
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,070
I don't have nothin' to confess,

594
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:40,158
but you, spillin' your beans,
look what it's done to ye.

595
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,288
It's made ye mad.

596
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:48,424
And I knew ye was mad
when y'smashed up that lifeboat just now,

597
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,673
a-chasing me with an ax,
tryin' to kill oi' Tom.

598
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,342
Don't ye trust me, Tommy?

599
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:03,059
Better hand me
the dinner knife ye pocketed.

600
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,150
Y'ain't safe with it.

601
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,243
That's a good lad.

602
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:20,747
Them's government property.

603
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,503
Deducted from your pay.

604
01:21:32,096 --> 01:21:34,132
Look at your shiverin'.

605
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:38,428
You're so mad, y'know not up from down.

606
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:44,809
How long have we been on this rock?

607
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:47,023
Five weeks?

608
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:48,563
Two days?

609
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:51,528
Where are we?

610
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:57,448
Help me to recollect,
who are you again, Tommy?

611
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:01,868
I'm probably
a figment of your imagination.

612
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:06,293
This rock is a figment
of your imagination too.

613
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:14,006
You're probably wand'rin' through a grove
of tag alders up north in canady,

614
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:19,056
like a frostbitten maniac,
talkin' to yourself,

615
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,512
knee-deep in snow.

616
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:46,830
I could use me a smoke.

617
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:51,338
We're outta drink.

618
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,448
Ooh!

619
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,038
Monkey pump!

620
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

621
01:24:57,843 --> 01:24:59,458
This place is a sty.

622
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,295
Mornin' to you too.

623
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:12,058
I wish I could go for a walk.

624
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,315
Be my guest. You'll get drowned.

625
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

626
01:26:57,003 --> 01:26:58,288
Fiery pit.

627
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:07,094
Ain't there no justice left in this world?

628
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:17,604
Thankee.

629
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:20,481
What's wrong with your hand?

630
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,146
The other one.

631
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:30,826
Ye hear o' tetanus?

632
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:34,113
- Tet-a-nus?
- Hmm. Yeah.

633
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:36,243
It started as a sliver of a cut, is all...

634
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,334
I said I heard of it.

635
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,751
From the forestaysail
when we shoved off...

636
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:41,399
- Don't you ever shut up?
- But come a fortnight,

637
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:43,630
- the bosun was a-shakin'.
- Stop.

638
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:46,925
His jaw locked tighter than an anchor...

639
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,549
Shut your gum, goddamn it!
I can't hear no more!

640
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:51,550
What were it ye accused me of?

641
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:54,641
Y'already told me y'had me figgerd.

642
01:27:55,687 --> 01:28:02,104
I'm tired of your damned-fool yarns
and your cap'n ahab horseshit.

643
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:05,026
You sound like a goddamned parody.

644
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:09,698
Givin' and nagging orders
like a spinster schoolmarm,

645
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:11,366
and all the while turning this station

646
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:13,639
- to the devil's own rum hole.
- You're makin' a fool of yourself.

647
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:15,278
Well, it's all horseshit...

648
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:21,205
Your leg, and your sea life, all of it!

649
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:27,424
And if I hear one more word of horseshit
coming out of your foul, rotten-toothed,

650
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:29,877
- smelly old mouth...
- Ye... damn ye...

651
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:32,713
Shut up your gum, goddamn it!
I ain't finished yet!

652
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:36,637
You think
you're so goddamned high and mighty

653
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,969
just 'cause
you're a goddamned lighthouse keeper?

654
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:42,352
Well, you ain't a captain of no ship
and you never was!

655
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:46,147
You ain't no general, you ain't no copper,

656
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:48,570
you ain't the president,
and you ain't my father!

657
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:51,026
And I'm sick of you actin' like you is!

658
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:58,076
I'm sick of your laughing, your snoring,
and your goddamned farts.

659
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,582
Your goddamned...

660
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:03,705
Goddamn your farts!

661
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:09,341
You smell like piss,
you smell like jism,

662
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:13,883
like rotten dick, like curdled foreskin,

663
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:17,721
like hot onions fucked
a farmyard shit house.

664
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:20,177
And I'm sick of your smell.
I'm sick of it!

665
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:21,978
I'm sick of it, you goddamned drunk.

666
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:25,933
You goddamned no-account,
son-of-a-bitch-bastard liar!

667
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,312
That's what you are!

668
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:34,742
You're a goddamned drunken,
horse-shitting, short, shit liar.

669
01:29:35,412 --> 01:29:36,572
A liar!

670
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:44,872
Ye have a way with words, Tommy.

671
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:48,205
Damn you!

672
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:53,676
You're relieved of your duties.

673
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:58,469
No need to tell me, old-timer.

674
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,020
"Assistant slept late."

675
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:14,026
"Work below standard."

676
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:16,945
"Attitude hostile."

677
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,412
"Assistant missing."

678
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,744
"Given to habitual self-abuse
in the supply shed."

679
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:30,755
"Drunk on duty!"

680
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:32,416
"Assault!"

681
01:30:32,886 --> 01:30:33,886
"Theft!"

682
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:38,134
"Recommend severance without pay."

683
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:41,387
Severance without pay?

684
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:44,435
Are you trying to ruin me?

685
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:46,892
I'm a hard worker.

686
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:50,229
I am. I work as hard as any man.

687
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,356
- Ye lie, Thomas.
- Stop it!

688
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:56,110
Ye lie to yourself,
but y'ain't have the sauce to see it.

689
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:57,407
Please...

690
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:01,619
Just let me into the light, old man.

691
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:06,242
I've learned so much from you.
Just let me show you. Another chance.

692
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,869
Forgive and forget, I says.

693
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:11,579
Just let me into that lantern, is all.

694
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:15,087
Don't make me beg... or I'll beg.

695
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:17,009
I'll beg if that's what you want.
I'll beg.

696
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:20,009
Please.

697
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:24,684
Please. Please! Please!

698
01:31:25,105 --> 01:31:26,220
Stand down.

699
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:31,441
You selfish bastard!
Keepin' it all to yourself.

700
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:36,113
You left your old lady,
your children, for what? For what?

701
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:41,739
Look at ye, handsome lad,
with eyes bright as a lady.

702
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:45,447
Come to this rock playin' the tough.

703
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:49,080
Ye make me laugh with your false grum.

704
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:54,039
Ye pretended to some mystery
in your quietudes,

705
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:57,376
but there ain't no mystery.

706
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:01,922
You're an open book. A picture, says I.

707
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:07,144
A painted actress
screaming in the footlights,

708
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:10,893
a bitch what wants to be coveted
for nothin' but being born,

709
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:13,896
cryin' 'bout the silver spoon
what should've been yours.

710
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:19,231
Now look at ye cryin'.

711
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,450
Boo. Boo.

712
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:24,910
What you gonna do?

713
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:29,162
Will ye kill me? Will ye?

714
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:32,327
Will y'kill me like y'done that gull?

715
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:35,914
- I didn't...
- Liar! Y'murdering dog!

716
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:41,887
'Twas ye what changed the wind on us.
"Twas ye what damned us, dog. 'Twas ye!"

717
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:46,300
Will y'do what y'wish
y'done to oi' winslow?

718
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:49,602
Will ye best me then?
For winslow were right.

719
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:54,809
Thomas, you're a dog. A filthy dog! A dog!

720
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,040
Git down!

721
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:13,288
Let go of me!

722
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:16,394
You're killing me!

723
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:57,983
Bark.

724
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:04,316
Bark, boy.

725
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:07,698
Bark, laddie.

726
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:10,787
Bark.

727
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:15,786
Woof.

728
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:18,497
Ain't ye never been to sea before?

729
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:21,003
Bark, I says. Bark!

730
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:24,048
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

731
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:25,545
Bark, laddie!

732
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:29,129
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

733
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:31,135
- Now, there's a good boy.
- Ruff!

734
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:36,306
- There's a good dog.
- Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

735
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:38,979
Ruff!

736
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:41,395
Now roll over.

737
01:35:58,628 --> 01:35:59,708
Come on.

738
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:02,203
Come on.

739
01:36:11,808 --> 01:36:13,514
Git!

740
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,352
Come on.

741
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:38,118
Get up here.

742
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:59,010
Good boy. Good boy.

743
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:02,639
Now you get in there, where you belong.

744
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:06,351
You do as I say, dog.

745
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:12,941
There's my good lad.

746
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:31,593
Ye wish to see
what's in the lantern?

747
01:37:33,348 --> 01:37:35,054
So did me last assistant.

748
01:37:35,141 --> 01:37:36,347
Shut up, old dog!

749
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:39,725
Polish your brasswork.

750
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:47,317
O what protean forms swim up
from men's minds,

751
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:51,066
and melt in hot promethean plunder,

752
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:55,070
scorching eyes,
with divine shames and horror...

753
01:37:57,330 --> 01:38:01,824
And casting them down to Davy Jones.

754
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:05,660
The others, still blind,

755
01:38:05,755 --> 01:38:08,713
yet in it see

756
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:13,214
all the divine graces

757
01:38:13,971 --> 01:38:18,715
and to Fiddler's green sent,

758
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:25,522
where no man is suffered to want or toil,
but is...

759
01:38:27,276 --> 01:38:28,356
Ancient...

760
01:38:29,779 --> 01:38:32,816
Mutable and unchanging...

761
01:38:34,283 --> 01:38:39,994
As the she who girdles 'round the globe.

762
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:43,038
Them's truth.

763
01:38:44,877 --> 01:38:46,208
You'll be punished.

764
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

765
01:40:15,885 --> 01:40:17,876
The light belongs to me!

766
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:15,317
Should pale death with treble dread
make the ocean caves our bed,

767
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:21,735
god who hear'st the surges roll,
deign to save the suppliant soul.
