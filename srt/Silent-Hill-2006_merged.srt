1
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,028
Sharon!

2
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,447
She's not here.

3
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:35,493
Oh, God.
Christopher, can you see anything?

4
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,203
Sharon!

5
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,123
- Sharon!
- She's there.

6
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,502
Sharon!

7
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,964
Honey!

8
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,844
Sharon!

9
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,266
Wait for Mommy!

10
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:17,287
Sharon!

11
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:25,086
Wait.

12
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:38,933
Sharon! Honey!

13
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:54,534
Oh, my God. Sharon!

14
00:01:54,702 --> 00:02:11,551
Home.

15
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,345
No!

16
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:23,063
- Home! Home!
- We're going home.

17
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:25,106
Silent Hill!

18
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:27,984
- Silent Hill!
- Rose!

19
00:02:28,152 --> 00:02:30,111
- Wake up.
- Hey.

20
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:32,989
- It's okay, sweetie. We're here now.
- It's okay. It's okay.

21
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:34,699
It's okay.

22
00:02:36,077 --> 00:02:38,620
It's okay, baby.
We're going right home.

23
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:41,457
- What are we gonna do?
- We'll get there.

24
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,544
We'll find a way through this.
We'll find a way.

25
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:46,337
No.

26
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:50,132
- She said it again.
- I know.

27
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:55,931
- Come on, baby. It's okay.
- Calm down, baby. It's okay.

28
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,683
- It's okay, baby.
- We're right here.

29
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:06,233
It's okay.

30
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,445
It's okay, baby.

31
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:40,602
- Wanna see?
- Sure.

32
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:43,229
What are you doing there, pumpkin?

33
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:50,487
This is an amazing lion.
Did you do that all by yourself?

34
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,407
I'm so impressed with you, honey.

35
00:04:00,248 --> 00:04:04,877
Hey, you know we're going
on a special trip, don't you?

36
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,838
Do you know where we're going?

37
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,799
No?

38
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:14,553
Honey, sometimes when you go
to sleep, you go on a little walk.

39
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,015
And sometimes
you talk about a place...

40
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,060
...called Silent Hill.

41
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:25,023
I don't remember.

42
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:27,359
Oh, that's okay, sweetie.

43
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:31,363
That's why we're gonna go there,
so you can remember.

44
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,540
Daddy's not coming?

45
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:46,629
No, sweetie.
It's gonna be just you and me.

46
00:05:26,713 --> 00:05:29,965
Hey.

47
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,218
Break's over, sweetie.

48
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,679
You awake?

49
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:38,598
You wanna go?

50
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:59,829
Damn it, Rose. What's going on?

51
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,168
Hi, this is Rose Da Silva.

52
00:06:05,627 --> 00:06:09,130
Please leave a message,
and I'll call you back.

53
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:28,984
Oh, no, Rose.

54
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:37,534
No.

55
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:52,904
Honey, you're awake?

56
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,281
Long drive.

57
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:56,826
Can I ask you something, sweetie?

58
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:01,664
Why did you change your pictures?

59
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:05,877
I didn't.

60
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:08,087
- Mommy?
- You can't remember?

61
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,507
No. I don't like that, Mommy.

62
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:15,261
- Baby, you can't remember doing this?
- Who did that?

63
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:18,514
- Hey, hey, baby, it's okay.
- Mommy, who did that?

64
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:20,892
It's okay, honey. Mommy's here.

65
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:24,520
Can you wait in the car for me?

66
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:27,148
Can I sit in front?

67
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:31,110
- Of course you can sit in the front.
- Okay.

68
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,959
Jimmy, we need
a ham and cheese on white.

69
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:47,586
Hi.

70
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,299
I just wanna pay for the gas.

71
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:54,594
And can you tell me the best way
to get to Silent Hill?

72
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:57,764
I can't seem to find it on the map.

73
00:08:57,932 --> 00:09:01,434
- Why do you wanna go there?
- I... I read about it.

74
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,395
Road don't go through no more.

75
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:07,315
Your card was declined.

76
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:12,237
Hey there.

77
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:16,991
- Is everything all right?
- Don't talk to strangers.

78
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:20,078
Good girl.

79
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:23,331
All right. Well, thanks for your help.

80
00:09:27,962 --> 00:09:29,671
Why did you cut off the cards?

81
00:09:29,838 --> 00:09:31,924
That's not gonna stop me
from taking her there.

82
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:35,052
Listen, honey,
we gotta put Sharon in a hospital.

83
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:37,554
She needs constant care,
and she needs medication.

84
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:40,474
The medication doesn't work.

85
00:09:40,642 --> 00:09:43,270
She's getting worse every day.

86
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:47,148
Honey, the adoption people said
Sharon came from West Virginia...

87
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,859
...and Silent Hill is in West Virginia.

88
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:51,903
I'm not giving up on her, Chris.
I'm not.

89
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:54,030
Have you actually read
the websites, Rose?

90
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:56,992
Yes, Chris, I read them.

91
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:00,745
Just trust me on this, please?
Just trust me on this.

92
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:02,539
Listen, honey...

93
00:10:02,707 --> 00:10:06,251
- I love Sharon every bit as much as I...
- Chris, I gotta go.

94
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,130
- I love you.

95
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:13,967
- Need any help, ma'am?
- No, we're... We're fine, thanks.

96
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:18,305
We're fine.

97
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:36,136
Are we there?

98
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,722
Not yet, honey.

99
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:52,027
Keep your seatbelt fastened.

100
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:55,572
Hey!

101
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:17,302
Mommy!

102
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,213
It's okay. It's just the radio.

103
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:53,632
- I'm turning it off.
- Mommy!

104
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:46,354
Sharon?

105
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:54,695
Sharon!

106
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:58,407
Somebody! Help!

107
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:00,576
Please!

108
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,623
We've had an accident!

109
00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:12,297
Anybody!

110
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:23,309
Sharon. Honey.

111
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,532
Ashes.

112
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:59,450
Sharon!

113
00:16:00,243 --> 00:16:01,911
Wait!

114
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:03,788
Sharon!

115
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:05,498
Wait!

116
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:30,315
Sharon!

117
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:36,238
Sharon?

118
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:44,914
Honey?

119
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,839
What's happening?

120
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,640
Mommy.

121
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:45,810
Sharon.

122
00:18:20,722 --> 00:18:37,280
Sharon?

123
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,102
Hello?

124
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,583
Hey!

125
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,293
Wait!

126
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,003
Hey!

127
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:38,802
Sharon.

128
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,652
No!

129
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:17,301
Help me!

130
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:22,389
Help.

131
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:25,267
Help me. Help.

132
00:20:25,435 --> 00:20:28,187
Someone! Shit!

133
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,860
Get off me! Get off!

134
00:21:08,229 --> 00:21:09,647
Get off! Get off!

135
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:11,148
Get off me!

136
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:14,068
No! Get off me!

137
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:18,614
No! Get off me! Get off me!

138
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:36,340
Get off...!

139
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:31,376
Only the dark one opens
and closes the door to Silent Hill.

140
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,169
Please.

141
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:37,966
I don't know what's happening.
Do you know what's going on here?

142
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,719
My daughter.

143
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,889
I'm looking for my daughter.
I'm afraid that she's been hurt.

144
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,475
We've all lost our children.

145
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:49,562
Our light.

146
00:23:50,523 --> 00:23:52,524
They deceived me.

147
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:54,109
Their evil.

148
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,862
Their hate.

149
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,366
They hurt my child.

150
00:24:01,534 --> 00:24:03,535
They did terrible things to her.

151
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:06,538
Alessa.

152
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,750
This is my daughter, Sharon.

153
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:12,878
She sleepwalks,
so you have to be careful...

154
00:24:13,045 --> 00:24:18,216
...but if you see her,
please, tell her to wait for me.

155
00:24:18,593 --> 00:24:21,344
Yes, she's mine.

156
00:24:21,512 --> 00:24:22,721
- It was mine.
- It's mine.

157
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:24,764
- It's mine.
- It's mine!

158
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:26,766
- It's mine!
- Get off me!

159
00:24:34,442 --> 00:24:38,111
Into the fire
she swallowed their hate.

160
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:08,810
- Hi there.
- Yeah.

161
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:14,233
Listen, my wife,
she came through here last night.

162
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,152
- Maybe you saw her?
- Daughter worked night shift.

163
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,409
Actually, she was heading
for this place, Silent Hill.

164
00:25:24,577 --> 00:25:26,787
- How do I get there?
- You don't.

165
00:25:26,955 --> 00:25:28,956
Town's closed down
because of the coal fire...

166
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:31,667
...still burning underground,
you know?

167
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:34,379
Breathe enough of them fumes,
oh, bound to kill you.

168
00:25:37,383 --> 00:25:38,925
Okay...

169
00:25:40,427 --> 00:25:42,470
...where's the turnoff?

170
00:25:55,527 --> 00:25:57,236
Sharon?

171
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:30,729
Come on.

172
00:26:37,903 --> 00:26:41,489
Hi, this is Chris.
Please leave a message.

173
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:43,659
Christopher, it's me.

174
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:47,830
I'm in Silent Hill.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

175
00:26:47,998 --> 00:26:50,291
Sharon's lost,
but I think I know where she is...

176
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:53,753
...so I'm going to the school
to look for her.

177
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:57,465
I'm not okay, all right?
I need your help.

178
00:26:57,632 --> 00:27:01,344
Please, please, hurry.

179
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:05,222
Fuck. Come on!

180
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,850
Ma'am, I want you to put
both hands on the wheel.

181
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:13,022
Put both hands on the wheel.

182
00:27:15,192 --> 00:27:17,026
Where's the little girl, ma'am?

183
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:20,822
Please, my daughter, she's gone.
I need your help.

184
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,991
- Get out of the car.
- What?

185
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,743
Move it.

186
00:27:25,953 --> 00:27:27,621
Jesus, what are you doing?

187
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:29,915
- You're under arrest.
- What?

188
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:33,126
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

189
00:27:33,294 --> 00:27:36,088
I don't think you understand.
There's something weird going on.

190
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,798
My daughter, she's in danger.

191
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:40,134
If you really cared,
you wouldn't have sped off.

192
00:27:40,302 --> 00:27:42,553
Listen to me, she 's ill.
She sleepwalks.

193
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:45,139
Just calm right down.
I'm gonna find the little girl.

194
00:27:47,476 --> 00:27:49,811
Officer Bennett to base, over.

195
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:54,023
Base, do you copy, over?

196
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:57,151
- Shit.
- You're bleeding.

197
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:03,616
Cracked my head on the road
pretty good...

198
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:07,286
...when my bike went down.
I must have been out for a while.

199
00:28:07,663 --> 00:28:10,998
- You all right to walk?
- Sure.

200
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,836
Then it looks like we'll be
hiking back to Brahams.

201
00:28:14,003 --> 00:28:15,337
What?

202
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:18,340
You're going back to the station.

203
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:20,676
- Are you kidding?
- Nope.

204
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:23,178
Have you heard
a single word I've said?

205
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:24,972
- Yeah, I hear you.
- Have you heard...

206
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,682
...a single word I've said?

207
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:30,269
I'm sure she's at the school,
we just need to turn around...

208
00:28:30,437 --> 00:28:33,272
- Silent Hill...
- sorry...

209
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,023
- Sharon...
- lost...

210
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:40,864
- think I know where...
- going to the school to look for her...

211
00:28:41,031 --> 00:28:42,532
I'm not okay...

212
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,911
I need your... Your help.
Please, hurry!

213
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:07,433
Sorry, sir, this road is closed.
You'll have to turn around.

214
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:10,478
I'm looking for my wife.
She may have come through here.

215
00:29:11,313 --> 00:29:15,733
She drives a Jeep Liberty.
Silver, Ohio plates.

216
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:20,279
Sir, this man's wife
was driving the Jeep.

217
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,239
Bring him down.

218
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,074
- Come on.
- You've seen her?

219
00:29:30,582 --> 00:29:31,665
Where is she?

220
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:34,753
Inspector Thomas Gucci.
Enjoying the weather, are you?

221
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:37,172
For God's sake,
I'm trying to find my wife.

222
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,590
I know. Hang on a second.

223
00:29:38,758 --> 00:29:41,176
Now, that vehicle you were
talking about, we found it.

224
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,595
It's at the end of the bridge here,
but it's empty.

225
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:46,306
We've got no indication
anyone's come under any harm.

226
00:29:46,474 --> 00:29:48,308
- Good Christ.
- Now, you mind telling me...

227
00:29:48,476 --> 00:29:50,477
...what your wife's doing
up here, Mr...?

228
00:29:50,645 --> 00:29:52,771
- Da Silva, Chris Da Silva.
- My pleasure, Chris...

229
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:55,649
The faster we start looking,
the faster we're gonna find her.

230
00:29:55,816 --> 00:29:58,319
All right, hold your horses,
hold your horses, Chris.

231
00:29:58,487 --> 00:30:00,613
I've also got a missing deputy.

232
00:30:00,781 --> 00:30:02,907
And knowing Officer Cybil Bennett
the way I do...

233
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:05,868
...she's probably out there looking
for your wife and daughter.

234
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:08,371
Bobby, make sure no one
comes through that barricade.

235
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:10,456
We're gonna get our asses up
to Silent Hill.

236
00:30:10,624 --> 00:30:12,250
- Let's take a look around.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:14,293
While Chris here tells me
what's going on.

238
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:19,006
She disappeared yesterday.
I spoke to her...

239
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:20,883
...when she stopped for gas
in Brahams.

240
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:23,970
Why were you coming up here
in the middle of the night?

241
00:30:24,137 --> 00:30:27,640
- I thought it would help her.
- You people. You get off the highway...

242
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:31,478
...from whatever big city, bringing
all your sick problems with you.

243
00:30:33,273 --> 00:30:35,566
Why aren't you listening to me?

244
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:38,151
We had a guy come up here
two years ago...

245
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,655
...snatched a little boy from a rest stop,
dropped him into a mine vent.

246
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:43,657
I never wanna see
anything like that again.

247
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:46,660
Look, I don't know what
you're thinking, but you're not helping.

248
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:49,037
There is no way I would ever
harm my own daughter.

249
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:51,583
How do I even know
she is your daughter?

250
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,167
Come on.

251
00:30:58,132 --> 00:30:59,882
What the hell?

252
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,671
Okay.

253
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,090
Now do you see
what I'm talking about?

254
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:41,884
Will you take these handcuffs
off me?

255
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:44,512
No. Get walking.

256
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,349
There's a fire-lookout tower
on the far side of Toluca Lake.

257
00:31:47,516 --> 00:31:50,268
- It should have a radio.
- Fuck you, you stupid cop.

258
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:53,772
This place is completely cut off.

259
00:31:54,565 --> 00:31:57,067
- You have no idea what's going on.
- Hey!

260
00:31:58,194 --> 00:32:00,362
Hey, you up there!

261
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,657
I'm a police officer!

262
00:32:07,745 --> 00:32:09,412
What's going on?

263
00:32:17,088 --> 00:32:18,922
What is that?

264
00:32:23,386 --> 00:32:24,761
Stand back.

265
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:30,726
Jesus Christ, shoot it.

266
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,242
Stay where you are!

267
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:48,453
Stop!

268
00:34:41,321 --> 00:34:42,363
Sharon!

269
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:13,582
Rose.

270
00:36:33,187 --> 00:36:35,438
Mrs. Da Silva,
I am an officer of the law...

271
00:36:35,606 --> 00:36:37,523
...and I will take you to safety.

272
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:40,610
Mrs. Da Silva,
I am an officer of the law...

273
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:42,779
...and I will take you to safety.

274
00:36:42,947 --> 00:36:45,698
- Why don't you let me do that?
- Ninety percent of the time...

275
00:36:45,866 --> 00:36:47,200
...when a wife takes a run...

276
00:36:47,368 --> 00:36:49,702
...she takes the daughter
to a place like this...

277
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,913
...I'd say she's damn mad
at her husband.

278
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,875
You like hauling skeletons
out of your family closet?

279
00:36:56,043 --> 00:36:59,504
No, not all the time, but we're
driving on top of them right now.

280
00:36:59,672 --> 00:37:02,132
Coal fire's still burning
underneath.

281
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,218
You see the barbershop over there?

282
00:37:04,678 --> 00:37:07,262
- Used to be my father's.
- Your father?

283
00:37:08,723 --> 00:37:10,516
He's dead.

284
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:13,269
November '74,
when the fire caught.

285
00:37:13,437 --> 00:37:16,815
They tried to evacuate this place
as quick as they could...

286
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:19,985
...but it was hellish, people were
dying and disappearing.

287
00:37:20,152 --> 00:37:22,862
Hell, they couldn't even find
half the bodies.

288
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,656
That was the end of Silent Hill.

289
00:37:24,824 --> 00:37:28,076
These were good people,
most of them.

290
00:37:28,285 --> 00:37:30,620
Some, you might say deserved it.

291
00:37:30,788 --> 00:37:32,372
A little bit.

292
00:37:48,222 --> 00:37:50,181
Sharon!

293
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:23,070
Sharon.

294
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:28,742
Where are you hiding?

295
00:39:39,797 --> 00:39:44,342
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!

296
00:39:46,554 --> 00:39:48,471
Alessa Gillespie.

297
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:56,813
Hey!

298
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:00,775
Wait!

299
00:41:05,344 --> 00:41:07,053
It's okay.

300
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:11,265
It's gonna be okay.

301
00:41:14,478 --> 00:41:16,979
I promise I'm gonna help you.

302
00:43:06,844 --> 00:43:08,345
Come on.

303
00:43:08,846 --> 00:43:10,723
Oh, God.

304
00:43:11,058 --> 00:43:12,641
Come on.

305
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:23,903
Help me. Oh, God.
Please, please, help me. Help...

306
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:32,078
Help me. Please, help me.
Help me. Help me, please.

307
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,093
It's happening again.

308
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

309
00:46:43,777 --> 00:46:48,156
Help me! Please! Please!

310
00:47:00,378 --> 00:47:02,963
Come on! Come on!

311
00:47:17,061 --> 00:47:18,854
Rose!

312
00:47:20,398 --> 00:47:22,190
Sharon!

313
00:47:25,903 --> 00:48:33,306
Rose!

314
00:48:44,194 --> 00:48:45,945
Rose.

315
00:49:01,336 --> 00:49:03,629
- Rose!
- Put your mask on.

316
00:49:03,797 --> 00:49:06,465
Rose, where are you?

317
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:15,224
- I felt her.
- You what?

318
00:49:15,392 --> 00:49:16,767
Her perfume.

319
00:49:18,103 --> 00:49:19,520
- She was here.
- Who was?

320
00:49:19,688 --> 00:49:21,773
- My wife.
- She wasn't here. Put this mask on.

321
00:49:21,941 --> 00:49:24,735
- Perfume.
- Breathe. Through that mask.

322
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on, let's go.
We're gonna go this way.
Chris, come on.
- She was here.
- No, no, she wasn't here.

323
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:35,871
I know it.

324
00:49:51,638 --> 00:49:52,930
Come on.

325
00:49:53,098 --> 00:49:55,558
Come on. Let's keep looking.

326
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

327
00:50:22,462 --> 00:50:24,671
Get off! Get off! Get off!

328
00:50:38,562 --> 00:50:40,480
Get me that pipe.

329
00:50:41,357 --> 00:50:43,608
Rose, the pipe!

330
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,778
Okay. Okay.

331
00:50:48,405 --> 00:50:51,115
- I got it. I got it.
- Quick, come on!

332
00:51:06,508 --> 00:51:08,300
Can we get out of here?

333
00:51:08,844 --> 00:51:10,469
We're trapped.

334
00:51:11,054 --> 00:51:12,555
Last mag.

335
00:51:12,722 --> 00:51:15,432
- That's all the bullets you got?
- Yeah.

336
00:51:18,103 --> 00:51:19,728
Thanks.

337
00:51:31,826 --> 00:51:33,076
You hear that?

338
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
That's him.

339
00:51:48,301 --> 00:51:50,302
Stay down! Stay down!

340
00:51:50,469 --> 00:51:52,596
Jesus Christ.

341
00:51:54,181 --> 00:51:56,099
Get down!

342
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,817
Shit!

343
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

344
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:12,720
What?

345
00:53:52,304 --> 00:53:56,391
What the fuck?

346
00:53:58,686 --> 00:54:01,438
You saw that, right?
That was real?

347
00:54:03,858 --> 00:54:05,316
What the fuck is going on?

348
00:54:05,484 --> 00:54:08,236
All right, I know this is crazy. I know.

349
00:54:08,404 --> 00:54:10,822
We gotta calm right down,
because my kid is not here...

350
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,950
...and I've gotta find her
before this happens again.

351
00:54:14,702 --> 00:54:16,828
I don't even know where to start.

352
00:54:17,204 --> 00:54:18,913
I found this.

353
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:21,082
It's from a hotel.

354
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:24,211
I don't know where it is,
but she is in this hotel.

355
00:54:24,963 --> 00:54:26,630
Hotel?

356
00:54:30,052 --> 00:54:31,594
Hey.

357
00:54:33,388 --> 00:54:35,473
It's gonna be okay.

358
00:54:37,184 --> 00:54:39,227
We're gonna be okay.

359
00:54:52,158 --> 00:54:54,076
Now, don't be trying
anything, all right?

360
00:54:54,243 --> 00:54:56,286
We got men up here
all night long.

361
00:54:56,454 --> 00:54:59,206
We're gonna find your wife,
we're gonna find your daughter.

362
00:54:59,373 --> 00:55:02,334
Can't have civilians
wandering around on their own.

363
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,128
You're not telling me everything.

364
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,714
What really happened up here?

365
00:55:07,882 --> 00:55:10,217
Just let it rest in peace.

366
00:55:13,429 --> 00:55:15,847
- Directory assistance.
- Toluca County Archives, please.

367
00:55:16,015 --> 00:55:17,557
One moment.

368
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:20,228
- Archives?
- Yeah, listen.

369
00:55:20,395 --> 00:55:23,022
Do you have the records there
from Silent Hill?

370
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,359
- Which records, sir?
- The police records.

371
00:55:26,527 --> 00:55:29,028
Sorry, sir,
those records are confidential.

372
00:55:29,196 --> 00:55:31,365
No, no, I can't...
No, listen, I...

373
00:55:31,533 --> 00:55:33,784
Sorry, sir,
I can't access that information.

374
00:55:33,952 --> 00:55:35,452
- Listen, goddamn it.
- Sir.

375
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,037
- This is an emergency.
- I can't...

376
00:55:37,205 --> 00:55:39,248
I can't help you.

377
00:55:55,473 --> 00:55:58,225
They used to say
this place was haunted.

378
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:00,936
I think they were right.

379
00:56:10,363 --> 00:56:12,990
Help! No!

380
00:56:13,158 --> 00:56:15,033
- Stay away.
- Come on.

381
00:56:15,201 --> 00:56:18,121
Stay away, sinner.

382
00:56:18,289 --> 00:56:19,664
Get back!

383
00:56:19,832 --> 00:56:21,666
Hey.

384
00:56:21,834 --> 00:56:23,586
It's here.

385
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,590
Faith is our destroyer.
Faith has brought us doom.

386
00:56:27,757 --> 00:56:29,675
- Get back!
- Hey, hey!

387
00:56:29,843 --> 00:56:32,803
- Get back!
- Hey, stop.

388
00:56:32,971 --> 00:56:35,389
Think you of thee
who cast the first stone.

389
00:56:35,557 --> 00:56:37,933
Lambs without a shepherd,
shepherd without a flock.

390
00:56:38,602 --> 00:56:40,686
It's your sins which hold you here.

391
00:56:40,854 --> 00:56:42,438
- Stop your lies!
- Calm down.

392
00:56:42,606 --> 00:56:43,606
Calm down, it's okay.

393
00:56:43,773 --> 00:56:45,941
- We're not gonna hurt you.
- She's gone.

394
00:56:46,902 --> 00:56:48,485
What's your name?

395
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:52,448
Anna. My name is Anna.

396
00:56:52,616 --> 00:56:54,658
What's going on here, Anna?
Who was that?

397
00:56:54,826 --> 00:56:57,953
- I've seen her before.
- Dahlia was cast out.

398
00:56:58,121 --> 00:57:00,206
Not even the darkness wants her.

399
00:57:00,373 --> 00:57:03,000
- She's lost her daughter too.
- What?

400
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:08,547
- Sinners deserve to lose their spawn.
- What are you doing here, Anna?

401
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,885
Mother needs more food.

402
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:15,096
You mean there are
other people here?

403
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,186
Christabella keeps us safe.

404
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,813
- Anna.
- We take refuge in the church.

405
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:26,234
Anna, listen to me.

406
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:29,195
I've lost my daughter.
She's all alone.

407
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:32,198
Can you imagine how frightened
she must feel?

408
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,367
Tell me, have you seen her?

409
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,952
Do you know where she is?

410
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,667
If she has faith, she might survive.

411
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:43,834
If not...

412
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,922
I'm taking this.

413
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:51,968
Have you seen this?

414
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:54,804
I've seen it at the school.

415
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:59,183
It's on all the buildings
the elders of my elders built.

416
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:03,854
It's a symbol of our unity,
a symbol of our faith.

417
00:58:15,244 --> 00:58:16,953
Rose, look at this.

418
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:22,208
- What is it?
- Just like yours.

419
00:58:23,585 --> 00:58:27,046
- Where did you find it?
- They're all over the floor.

420
00:58:41,312 --> 00:58:42,562
Rose.

421
00:58:43,272 --> 00:58:44,897
Check this out.

422
00:58:46,734 --> 00:58:50,862
- What number did you take this from?
- 111.

423
00:58:52,823 --> 00:58:55,158
We gotta go to room 111.

424
01:00:28,673 --> 01:00:30,340
Gucci.

425
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:02,874
- Directory assistance.
- Yeah.

426
01:01:03,501 --> 01:01:06,086
Toluca County Orphanage, please.

427
01:01:06,254 --> 01:01:08,297
One moment, please.

428
01:01:10,175 --> 01:01:12,509
- Yes, I have that information for you.
- Yeah.

429
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:15,679
Can you give me that address?

430
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:28,066
We are wandering far
from refuge here.

431
01:01:30,236 --> 01:01:33,197
Let's keep her with us.
She's all we got.

432
01:02:00,393 --> 01:02:02,061
There's no room 111.

433
01:02:02,229 --> 01:02:04,688
The first burning.

434
01:02:05,524 --> 01:02:09,068
- What is it, Anna?
- The first burning.

435
01:02:09,236 --> 01:02:11,195
Before the town had a name.

436
01:02:11,363 --> 01:02:14,865
The elders of my elders
kept us pure.

437
01:02:15,408 --> 01:02:17,785
The founders of this town
were witch-hunters.

438
01:02:18,245 --> 01:02:20,788
Burning the witch
held back the darkness.

439
01:02:20,956 --> 01:02:22,623
It stopped the apocalypse.

440
01:02:28,463 --> 01:02:30,130
It's here.

441
01:02:46,482 --> 01:02:48,692
There's a room in here.

442
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,747
Look at this.

443
01:03:09,673 --> 01:03:11,257
Here.

444
01:03:11,925 --> 01:03:13,676
Damn.

445
01:03:28,735 --> 01:03:30,986
What is this place?

446
01:03:31,154 --> 01:03:33,363
I don't know.
We're in the next building.

447
01:03:33,531 --> 01:03:35,657
Some factory, maybe?

448
01:03:37,368 --> 01:03:39,536
Looks like there was a fire.

449
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:47,628
Hey.

450
01:04:08,567 --> 01:04:10,276
Rose!

451
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:42,935
Who are you?

452
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:57,117
It's okay.

453
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:01,663
Don't be scared.
I promise I'm not gonna hurt you.

454
01:05:19,975 --> 01:05:21,642
Rose?

455
01:05:43,498 --> 01:05:45,833
Okay. Come on.

456
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:47,710
Come on.

457
01:05:51,966 --> 01:05:55,093
It's okay. Hey.

458
01:05:55,344 --> 01:05:56,803
Hey.

459
01:05:59,766 --> 01:06:09,901
It's okay.

460
01:06:10,068 --> 01:06:12,278
I'm not gonna hurt you.

461
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:23,790
Oh, my God.

462
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:26,542
You could be her twin.

463
01:06:30,714 --> 01:06:32,715
Are you Alessa?

464
01:06:34,426 --> 01:06:36,552
Where's my Sharon?

465
01:06:37,221 --> 01:06:39,055
Look at me.

466
01:06:40,516 --> 01:06:42,517
I'm burning.

467
01:06:45,312 --> 01:06:46,855
Rose?

468
01:06:49,692 --> 01:06:50,818
Rose? My God.

469
01:06:51,736 --> 01:06:54,279
- How did you get over there?
- Where is she?

470
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:00,036
Grab onto it.

471
01:07:01,413 --> 01:07:05,041
- Now swing back around.
- Okay.

472
01:07:09,797 --> 01:07:11,214
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

473
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:13,299
What the hell
were you doing over there?

474
01:07:13,467 --> 01:07:15,009
You're gonna get yourself killed.

475
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:17,887
I think I just saw Dahlia's daughter.

476
01:07:19,557 --> 01:07:21,266
She was the one
that brought us here.

477
01:07:21,433 --> 01:07:22,767
What are you talking about?

478
01:07:22,935 --> 01:07:25,353
She was the one
that made me crash my car.

479
01:07:26,021 --> 01:07:27,272
Alessa.

480
01:07:27,439 --> 01:07:29,649
We don't say her name.

481
01:07:33,404 --> 01:07:35,947
That's the seal, isn't it, Anna?

482
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
The symbol of your faith?
Something terrible happened here.

483
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:51,673
We have to leave.
We have to leave!

484
01:07:52,967 --> 01:07:55,176
- The darkness is coming!
- Let's go.

485
01:07:55,595 --> 01:07:57,220
Let's go!

486
01:08:08,983 --> 01:08:11,276
The church isn't far.

487
01:08:11,444 --> 01:08:13,361
- Run. Run!
- Rose, come on!

488
01:08:13,529 --> 01:08:15,280
Rose!

489
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:26,833
Hurry!

490
01:08:33,966 --> 01:08:35,175
Rose.

491
01:08:35,343 --> 01:08:37,886
- Come!
- We gotta go.

492
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:57,491
- Rose, come on.
- I've seen this.

493
01:09:09,087 --> 01:09:10,837
Rose, let's go!

494
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:15,550
- Cybil!
- Rose, come on.

495
01:09:23,476 --> 01:09:24,476
Cybil!

496
01:09:24,644 --> 01:09:27,562
You run not towards sanctuary
but from your fears.

497
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:30,482
Do not join the others.
They are deceivers. They are damned.

498
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:32,234
- We gotta get inside.
- No!

499
01:09:32,402 --> 01:09:34,027
They are wolves
in the skin of sheep.

500
01:09:34,195 --> 01:09:37,073
They brought about their own hell.
They'll take you with them.

501
01:09:37,241 --> 01:09:39,493
- Filth and lies!
- Hey!

502
01:09:39,661 --> 01:09:41,078
Stop it!

503
01:09:42,414 --> 01:09:45,582
Please. I've seen your daughter.
I've seen Alessa.

504
01:09:48,545 --> 01:09:51,171
- It's coming!
- She's dead, isn't she?

505
01:09:51,339 --> 01:09:53,048
Fire doesn't cleanse, it blackens.

506
01:09:53,508 --> 01:09:55,551
- Listen to me.
- Rose, hurry!

507
01:09:55,885 --> 01:09:57,970
She looks exactly like Sharon.

508
01:09:58,138 --> 01:10:00,597
She brought us here, didn't she?

509
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,562
Why? What does she want?

510
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:08,439
Evil wakes in vengeance.

511
01:10:08,606 --> 01:10:11,275
Be careful what you choose.

512
01:10:31,172 --> 01:10:32,714
Rose!

513
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:08,209
Oh, God, no.

514
01:11:30,191 --> 01:11:31,566
- Witches!
- She's evil.

515
01:11:31,734 --> 01:11:32,985
Keep away the witches!

516
01:11:36,532 --> 01:11:38,533
- No.
- Send them back!

517
01:11:39,118 --> 01:11:40,535
No.

518
01:11:41,078 --> 01:11:42,578
We're lost.

519
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,340
This is a sanctuary.

520
01:12:04,393 --> 01:12:07,895
Please, Christabella,
they lured my Anna.

521
01:12:08,063 --> 01:12:10,523
They gave her to the fiend.

522
01:12:10,816 --> 01:12:14,443
Eleanor, you must remember
that Anna went against our laws.

523
01:12:14,611 --> 01:12:17,364
She went alone outside
into the devil's playground.

524
01:12:19,534 --> 01:12:22,870
She was not the responsibility
of these two strangers.

525
01:12:24,789 --> 01:12:26,957
We'll deal with them later.

526
01:12:32,882 --> 01:12:34,924
Now we must pray.

527
01:12:55,821 --> 01:12:57,071
And then I saw them...

528
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:00,658
...from whose presence
earth and heaven fled away.

529
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:03,703
And no home was left to them.

530
01:13:03,871 --> 01:13:05,997
And then I saw them...

531
01:13:06,165 --> 01:13:09,460
...from whose presence
earth and heaven fled away.

532
01:13:09,628 --> 01:13:12,379
And no home was left to them.

533
01:13:12,797 --> 01:13:15,591
And I saw the dead,
the great and the small...

534
01:13:15,759 --> 01:13:18,969
...and they were judged
according to their deeds.

535
01:13:19,137 --> 01:13:24,183
And I saw the dead,
the great and the small...

536
01:13:24,351 --> 01:13:27,604
...and they were judged
according to their deeds.

537
01:13:30,107 --> 01:13:34,486
And anyone's name not found
written in the book of life...

538
01:13:34,654 --> 01:13:37,864
...they will be thrown
into the lake of fire.

539
01:13:48,334 --> 01:13:51,211
And now I lay me down to sleep...

540
01:13:51,379 --> 01:13:54,339
...I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

541
01:13:54,507 --> 01:13:57,008
If I should die before I wake...

542
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:00,763
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

543
01:14:00,931 --> 01:14:02,807
Amen.

544
01:14:03,183 --> 01:14:05,935
All right, girls, into bed.
Quickly, now.

545
01:14:06,103 --> 01:14:08,729
No better place to be
on a rainy night.

546
01:14:08,897 --> 01:14:12,316
In you go, Lindsey, thattagirl.
You've got your bear, that's a girl.

547
01:14:12,484 --> 01:14:14,902
No. No talking
after lights are out.

548
01:14:18,657 --> 01:14:20,616
Good night, children.

549
01:14:20,784 --> 01:14:22,827
And God bless.

550
01:14:26,791 --> 01:14:29,334
I'm sorry, Sister Margaret,
this really can't wait.

551
01:14:30,211 --> 01:14:32,045
I can't imagine why.

552
01:14:33,923 --> 01:14:35,757
Nine years ago...

553
01:14:35,925 --> 01:14:37,968
...a baby was left
outside this orphanage.

554
01:14:38,136 --> 01:14:40,262
My wife and I were the ones
who adopted her.

555
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:43,265
I'm very happy for you,
Mr. Da Silva...

556
01:14:43,433 --> 01:14:47,269
...but I can't give out
information on our children.

557
01:14:48,855 --> 01:14:50,188
Look.

558
01:14:51,524 --> 01:14:54,569
That girl, she looks
exactly like my daughter.

559
01:14:54,737 --> 01:14:56,738
I can't help you, I'm sorry.

560
01:14:56,905 --> 01:14:59,574
- It's late.
- She must be 40 now.

561
01:14:59,742 --> 01:15:00,992
Where can I find her?

562
01:15:01,827 --> 01:15:03,745
This story isn't hers alone...

563
01:15:03,912 --> 01:15:05,663
...but all of ours!
- You people.

564
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:07,040
You got yourself something.

565
01:15:07,207 --> 01:15:10,209
You know what you got now, Chris?
How about breaking and entering?

566
01:15:10,377 --> 01:15:12,503
By the looks of this,
a little assault as well.

567
01:15:13,172 --> 01:15:14,922
Thank you, Thomas.

568
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:17,759
- This can't go any farther.
- It won't, Sister.

569
01:15:19,219 --> 01:15:21,429
You know,
I have some 12-year-olds...

570
01:15:21,597 --> 01:15:23,974
...who cover their tracks
better than you do.

571
01:15:24,351 --> 01:15:25,684
What's this?

572
01:15:25,852 --> 01:15:27,436
Look, Gucci, do you know her?

573
01:15:27,604 --> 01:15:30,105
Is that my daughter's birth mother?

574
01:15:35,278 --> 01:15:38,781
- Look, turn around.
- What are you doing?

575
01:15:40,825 --> 01:15:43,911
I knew that girl. I did.

576
01:15:45,038 --> 01:15:47,624
I was told she didn't make it
through the night.

577
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:50,001
The night of the fire.

578
01:15:50,252 --> 01:15:52,295
The night of the big fire
in Silent Hill.

579
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:57,008
There were these people...

580
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:00,178
...these fanatics.

581
01:16:00,346 --> 01:16:03,640
What they did
to that child was terrible.

582
01:16:03,808 --> 01:16:06,559
That was 30 years ago,
and it's over now.

583
01:16:06,977 --> 01:16:08,645
Not as far as I'm concerned.

584
01:16:09,271 --> 01:16:11,314
What's it gonna be, city boy?

585
01:16:11,482 --> 01:16:14,025
I can put you in jail...

586
01:16:14,193 --> 01:16:15,902
...or you can go home.

587
01:16:16,487 --> 01:16:19,240
And that's your definition of justice?

588
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:24,161
Many different forms
of justice, Chris.

589
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:27,915
See, you've got man's, God's...

590
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,835
...and even the devil's.

591
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:35,005
Certain forms you just can't control.

592
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,175
So I want you to go home now...

593
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,804
...to your nice warm bed...

594
01:16:40,972 --> 01:16:43,432
...and let me deal with this town...

595
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,351
...and what has happened
over the last 30 years.

596
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:49,354
Okay? End of story.

597
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:04,161
Tell me first how you got here.

598
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:08,748
Honestly, I don't know
how I got here.

599
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:11,835
Right now, I've lost my little girl...

600
01:17:12,003 --> 01:17:14,671
...and all I know is that
I'm supposed to be in this church.

601
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,883
Are you a person of faith?

602
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:19,385
- I love my daughter.
- That's not what I asked.

603
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:20,887
Who are you to judge?

604
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:24,307
We judge because the souls of history
hang in the balance.

605
01:17:24,475 --> 01:17:26,142
Because our faith
has never failed us.

606
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:28,769
Our faith keeps the darkness
of hell at bay.

607
01:17:28,937 --> 01:17:32,566
Then use your faith
to help me find my little girl.

608
01:17:33,193 --> 01:17:35,235
Only the demon knows where she is.

609
01:17:35,403 --> 01:17:37,696
Then tell me,
where do I find this demon?

610
01:17:39,532 --> 01:17:42,075
No one has ever returned
from the core of the darkness...

611
01:17:42,243 --> 01:17:43,660
...where the demon lies in wait.

612
01:17:43,828 --> 01:17:45,287
She's not gonna help us.
Let's go.

613
01:17:45,455 --> 01:17:48,040
If you wish to face the demon
to find your daughter...

614
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:49,416
...I won't stop you.

615
01:17:49,584 --> 01:17:52,294
- Christabella, they can't go down...
- Silence, Adam.

616
01:17:56,007 --> 01:17:58,717
Perhaps your faith will protect you.

617
01:17:59,135 --> 01:18:01,261
Perhaps not.

618
01:18:15,069 --> 01:18:17,320
If you don't wanna do this...

619
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,323
...I'll understand.

620
01:18:21,492 --> 01:18:23,493
Sharon's adopted...

621
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:25,621
...but I'm her mother.

622
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:28,916
I knew that from the moment
I first laid eyes on her.

623
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:33,128
She's lucky to have you.

624
01:18:34,548 --> 01:18:37,299
Mother is God in the eyes of a child.

625
01:19:48,165 --> 01:19:49,624
Quiet.

626
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:52,460
We're in his domain now.

627
01:19:57,883 --> 01:20:00,217
Look at this map. Memorize it.

628
01:20:01,219 --> 01:20:03,387
Your memory may save your life.

629
01:20:04,723 --> 01:20:07,725
- Do you see this room?
- Yeah.

630
01:20:07,893 --> 01:20:10,605
That is where the darkness lies.

631
01:20:10,773 --> 01:20:13,232
The demon is in the bowels
of this building.

632
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,777
It hides behind the face
of an innocent.

633
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:17,278
You mean a child?

634
01:20:17,446 --> 01:20:19,739
Don't believe your eyes.
Your eyes will lie to you.

635
01:20:19,907 --> 01:20:23,034
Faith is the only truth.

636
01:20:24,078 --> 01:20:25,286
I will pray for you, Rose...

637
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:28,748
...but I won't expect you
and your friend to return.

638
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:31,167
Goodbye.

639
01:20:33,587 --> 01:20:34,962
Adam.

640
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:38,675
Left. Right.

641
01:20:39,343 --> 01:20:41,719
Left. Left.

642
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:46,849
- Right. Right. Left.
- Take them to the lower level.

643
01:20:47,017 --> 01:20:48,851
- In the basement?
- Do it, then return.

644
01:20:49,019 --> 01:20:51,437
- Left. 3A.
- But...

645
01:20:51,605 --> 01:20:53,189
- Right. 4A.
- I said, do it.

646
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:57,527
- Left. Left. Right.
- Rose. Rose.

647
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:02,615
- Left. Right. Left. Left.
- Rose, she's killing you.

648
01:21:02,783 --> 01:21:05,119
- Rose!
- Let me do this.

649
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,289
I need to do this.

650
01:21:26,267 --> 01:21:27,851
Take this.

651
01:21:28,018 --> 01:21:31,896
They'll be drawn to the light,
but you won't be able to see without it.

652
01:21:34,692 --> 01:21:36,443
Thank you.

653
01:21:42,825 --> 01:21:45,618
- So this thing actually works?
- It will.

654
01:21:45,786 --> 01:21:47,829
If the demon wants you, it will.

655
01:21:49,999 --> 01:21:51,207
Forgive me.

656
01:21:52,585 --> 01:21:55,295
We've lived too long as scavengers.
I believe this is yours.

657
01:22:02,889 --> 01:22:05,640
Witch! Her child's
the likeness of Alessa.

658
01:22:05,808 --> 01:22:07,184
Her child's the next vessel.

659
01:22:07,351 --> 01:22:10,187
Stop her!
Don't let the witches go down!

660
01:22:15,026 --> 01:22:16,568
Come on!

661
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,454
Get off her!

662
01:22:29,624 --> 01:22:30,957
Find her.

663
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:34,377
No! Wait! Cybil!

664
01:22:34,545 --> 01:22:36,713
Cybil! Open the door!

665
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:02,199
No!

666
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:32,458
8A.

667
01:24:32,959 --> 01:24:37,297
7A. Right.

668
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:50,602
Right. 6A.

669
01:24:52,021 --> 01:24:53,980
4A.

670
01:24:54,983 --> 01:24:56,859
3A.

671
01:24:59,446 --> 01:25:02,198
Left, left. Right, right.

672
01:25:02,366 --> 01:25:05,076
Left, left.

673
01:26:19,111 --> 01:26:23,073
Okay. I can do this.

674
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

675
01:27:34,106 --> 01:27:37,024
Congratulations, Rose.

676
01:27:37,192 --> 01:27:38,859
You're here.

677
01:27:40,445 --> 01:27:42,029
You did it.

678
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:48,161
Your reward is the truth.

679
01:27:50,873 --> 01:27:55,001
Did you see that Alessa
was a good little girl?

680
01:27:57,672 --> 01:28:01,216
Even though nobody
looked at her that way.

681
01:28:01,926 --> 01:28:07,390
- Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
- Their parents told them she was bad.

682
01:28:08,433 --> 01:28:11,811
She didn't have a father
like they did.

683
01:28:18,068 --> 01:28:21,070
Alessa was alone in the world.

684
01:28:25,409 --> 01:28:29,871
You know what can happen
to little girls when they're left alone.

685
01:28:33,876 --> 01:28:35,918
It's okay, it's me, come on.

686
01:28:36,086 --> 01:28:38,504
Even her mother couldn't help.

687
01:28:40,883 --> 01:28:43,886
Even though she loved her baby.

688
01:28:44,762 --> 01:28:47,681
But the rest of the family
didn't love Alessa.

689
01:28:47,849 --> 01:28:51,143
They were just like the others
and made her scared.

690
01:28:51,311 --> 01:28:53,228
We know.
Even the children know it.

691
01:28:53,396 --> 01:28:54,938
Your daughter...

692
01:28:56,232 --> 01:28:58,567
Why you won't
just name the father...

693
01:29:01,989 --> 01:29:04,699
You've brought sin amongst us.

694
01:29:04,867 --> 01:29:06,826
The faithful must gather
in judgment...

695
01:29:06,994 --> 01:29:10,121
...for we are called to purify this filth.

696
01:29:10,331 --> 01:29:12,207
What does she mean, Mommy?

697
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:16,085
You're weak, my dear sister.
You always were.

698
01:29:16,253 --> 01:29:19,797
Trust us, Dahlia.
Have faith in our virtue.

699
01:29:19,965 --> 01:29:22,467
We will restore innocence.

700
01:29:23,135 --> 01:29:27,347
They had met many times
since the town was built...

701
01:29:27,514 --> 01:29:30,767
...to restore innocence and purity.

702
01:29:31,727 --> 01:29:33,978
They had a special place for that.

703
01:29:46,451 --> 01:29:48,911
Do you remember the hotel?

704
01:29:49,454 --> 01:29:52,249
I led you to all these places...

705
01:29:52,416 --> 01:29:55,877
...and you were very good
at following my clues.

706
01:29:56,671 --> 01:29:58,880
You may leave, Dahlia.

707
01:29:59,632 --> 01:30:01,508
We fight the sin, not the sinner.

708
01:30:02,051 --> 01:30:04,302
Mommy! Mommy!

709
01:30:05,012 --> 01:30:06,554
Mommy!

710
01:30:06,722 --> 01:30:10,058
You know how that feels,
don't you, Rose?

711
01:30:10,601 --> 01:30:12,978
To lose your little girl?

712
01:30:13,688 --> 01:30:15,855
What have I done?

713
01:30:18,359 --> 01:30:22,654
- Oh, God.
- Weep not for the demon.

714
01:30:23,197 --> 01:30:24,447
No!

715
01:30:24,615 --> 01:30:28,410
Once again
we are locked in mortal battle.

716
01:30:29,036 --> 01:30:32,622
They thought they knew
how to cast out evil.

717
01:30:33,749 --> 01:30:37,544
- Praise God for our clarity.
- Amen.

718
01:30:37,712 --> 01:30:41,966
Praise the innocent
for their sacrifice.

719
01:30:42,134 --> 01:30:44,135
But you should be careful
how you fight evil.

720
01:30:44,303 --> 01:30:47,431
- They give us back our purity.
- Purity.

721
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,519
- And our unity.
- Unity.

722
01:30:52,687 --> 01:30:56,356
Your weapons
can turn back on you.

723
01:31:21,799 --> 01:31:26,261
No.

724
01:31:26,429 --> 01:31:29,556
Now you know
why Dahlia is broken.

725
01:31:31,142 --> 01:31:33,560
She tried to get help...

726
01:31:33,728 --> 01:31:35,897
...but she went too late.

727
01:31:37,274 --> 01:31:39,485
Get her up, boys.
Get her up now!

728
01:31:39,819 --> 01:31:42,112
There were good people
in the town...

729
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,573
...people like you, Rose.

730
01:31:44,741 --> 01:31:47,201
People who like to help.

731
01:31:49,913 --> 01:31:54,291
Alessa was so lonely
and hurt and scared.

732
01:31:54,793 --> 01:31:57,544
They should have known better
than to hurt her so badly.

733
01:32:00,924 --> 01:32:03,550
When you're hurt
and scared for so long...

734
01:32:04,469 --> 01:32:06,970
...your fear and pain turn to hate...

735
01:32:07,138 --> 01:32:11,225
...and the hate
starts to change the world.

736
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:18,982
Alessa's hate grew and grew,
burning inside her.

737
01:32:23,238 --> 01:32:25,948
Her hate got so strong...

738
01:32:26,491 --> 01:32:30,285
...she even hurt someone
who was only curious.

739
01:32:44,594 --> 01:32:46,804
That's when I came.

740
01:32:53,854 --> 01:32:55,855
I told her it was their turn.

741
01:32:57,732 --> 01:33:03,487
I promised they would all
fall into her darkest dream.

742
01:33:33,145 --> 01:33:37,857
Now, Rose, we must talk.

743
01:34:30,538 --> 01:34:32,956
Don't be afraid.

744
01:34:39,171 --> 01:34:41,130
She won't hurt you.

745
01:34:41,715 --> 01:34:43,967
She needs your help.

746
01:34:44,134 --> 01:34:45,343
Who is she?

747
01:34:46,387 --> 01:34:49,514
- She is Alessa.
- Then who are you?

748
01:34:49,932 --> 01:34:53,893
I have many names.

749
01:34:54,436 --> 01:34:58,273
Right now,
I'm the dark part of Alessa.

750
01:34:59,650 --> 01:35:01,109
Where's my child?

751
01:35:01,569 --> 01:35:04,612
She's not your child.

752
01:35:06,657 --> 01:35:07,991
She's hers.

753
01:35:09,035 --> 01:35:12,788
The little girl is
what's left of her goodness.

754
01:35:13,081 --> 01:35:14,707
We hid her in safety...

755
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:18,043
...in the world outside this hell.

756
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:35,270
Now the dream
of this life must end...

757
01:35:35,438 --> 01:35:39,357
...and so, too,
must the dreamers within it.

758
01:35:39,525 --> 01:35:41,860
For over 30 years...

759
01:35:42,028 --> 01:35:45,196
...they've lied to their own souls.

760
01:35:45,364 --> 01:35:49,618
For 30 years they've denied
their own fate.

761
01:35:49,785 --> 01:35:52,954
But now is the end of days...

762
01:35:53,122 --> 01:35:55,999
...and I am the reaper.

763
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,168
What do you want?

764
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:00,879
All we ask for is satisfaction.

765
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:02,882
Satisfaction?

766
01:36:03,717 --> 01:36:05,676
Revenge.

767
01:36:07,471 --> 01:36:09,221
Why me?

768
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,599
You chose.

769
01:36:12,059 --> 01:36:14,393
You chose Sharon.

770
01:36:14,561 --> 01:36:17,855
Christabella will find Sharon.

771
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:20,900
She plans to purify her.

772
01:36:23,154 --> 01:36:25,197
Oh, God, no.

773
01:36:25,782 --> 01:36:29,201
Their blind conviction
repels me from their church.

774
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:33,080
I cannot enter
while they deny their fate...

775
01:36:33,247 --> 01:36:34,748
...but you can.

776
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:40,420
- Just tell me what I need to do.
- Tell them the truth.

777
01:37:53,247 --> 01:37:55,165
The child is mine!

778
01:37:55,332 --> 01:37:57,333
Mine!

779
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,758
She's mine.

780
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:08,428
She's mine!

781
01:38:14,393 --> 01:38:17,688
The truth is clear to those who see.

782
01:38:18,732 --> 01:38:22,359
Just as I could see
you had this child.

783
01:38:41,172 --> 01:38:42,714
Let's go.

784
01:38:45,384 --> 01:38:48,512
Out of the car. Turn around.

785
01:39:03,528 --> 01:39:05,529
Just a friendly warning...

786
01:39:06,072 --> 01:39:08,573
...I'll be back with people
who know what they're doing.

787
01:39:11,369 --> 01:39:15,122
Before you do that, Chris,
I wanna tell you about Officer Bennett.

788
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:19,752
Few years back, some wacko,
he abducted a kid...

789
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:23,089
...threw him down a mine vent
up there in Silent Hill.

790
01:39:23,465 --> 01:39:25,758
Cybil Bennett, she found that boy.

791
01:39:25,926 --> 01:39:27,677
She spent three days
holding onto him...

792
01:39:27,845 --> 01:39:30,096
...keeping him alive
until they were rescued.

793
01:39:30,264 --> 01:39:31,722
We know what we're doing.

794
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:33,892
I need to do everything I can.

795
01:39:40,817 --> 01:39:42,651
Let's go.

796
01:40:06,301 --> 01:40:08,552
Please.
Christabella, let her live.

797
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,972
Your weakness
led these souls to judgment.

798
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:13,474
- This time you will bear witness.
- She is innocent.

799
01:40:13,642 --> 01:40:16,644
Look at her.
She's the whelp of your daughter.

800
01:40:16,812 --> 01:40:18,062
The demon!

801
01:40:18,606 --> 01:40:23,860
The demon fathered this disgusting
abomination from her child!

802
01:40:24,028 --> 01:40:25,111
No, she's mine!

803
01:40:28,241 --> 01:40:30,326
Sharon. Sharon, look at me.

804
01:40:30,493 --> 01:40:33,120
Look at me. Don't be afraid.

805
01:40:33,288 --> 01:40:36,832
It's okay, it's okay.
Your mama's coming.

806
01:40:37,542 --> 01:40:41,253
Once again we are called upon
to restore innocence.

807
01:40:41,421 --> 01:40:45,341
We burn this witch.
We vanquish evil.

808
01:40:46,217 --> 01:40:48,427
No. You can't. You can't.

809
01:40:48,595 --> 01:40:51,263
- Don't let her say this! No!
- We burn the child!

810
01:40:51,431 --> 01:40:53,682
We fight the demon!

811
01:40:56,645 --> 01:40:57,937
She's just a child!

812
01:40:58,104 --> 01:41:01,065
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

813
01:41:01,524 --> 01:41:03,484
Let her go!

814
01:41:03,902 --> 01:41:07,989
Leave her alone!

815
01:41:08,658 --> 01:41:10,533
Those who aid the demon...

816
01:41:10,701 --> 01:41:14,537
...they must be cleansed
by the fire from whence they came.

817
01:41:14,705 --> 01:41:17,332
That's crazy. You're crazy.

818
01:41:18,042 --> 01:41:20,252
No!

819
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:22,088
Why are you listening to this?

820
01:41:22,255 --> 01:41:24,590
Why?

821
01:41:26,385 --> 01:41:29,387
Burn the witch! Burn her!

822
01:41:29,554 --> 01:41:34,684
Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn the witch!

823
01:41:41,692 --> 01:41:43,526
Sharon.

824
01:41:50,742 --> 01:41:52,785
Evil witch!

825
01:41:53,704 --> 01:41:55,746
Suffer.

826
01:42:00,127 --> 01:42:06,758
Burn the witch! Burn her!

827
01:42:12,141 --> 01:42:14,559
Oh, my God.

828
01:42:21,775 --> 01:42:32,243
Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn the witch! Burn her!

829
01:42:32,411 --> 01:42:33,995
Burn her!

830
01:42:36,373 --> 01:42:38,750
You're in your own hell.

831
01:42:46,884 --> 01:42:50,636
Mama, be with me.

832
01:43:13,996 --> 01:43:15,914
Here is where the apocalypse began.

833
01:43:16,082 --> 01:43:18,958
This is where we stopped
the annihilation of the world.

834
01:43:19,126 --> 01:43:21,669
We drew a line in the sand
and said:

835
01:43:21,837 --> 01:43:24,297
"Demon, you will not cross!"

836
01:43:24,465 --> 01:43:28,176
But the demon is wicked,
full of treachery.

837
01:43:28,344 --> 01:43:32,514
Yet again he comes to tempt us
in the guise of an innocent.

838
01:43:32,681 --> 01:43:34,724
To rid the world of this demon...

839
01:43:34,892 --> 01:43:37,560
...we must burn this child!

840
01:43:39,355 --> 01:43:41,397
That's not gonna happen!

841
01:43:44,401 --> 01:43:45,401
Mommy!

842
01:43:46,487 --> 01:43:49,906
It's okay, baby.
Everything's gonna be okay.

843
01:43:50,074 --> 01:43:54,119
Oh, my God.

844
01:43:54,286 --> 01:43:56,454
What have you people done?

845
01:43:56,622 --> 01:43:59,918
- You have returned.
- Yes, I have.

846
01:44:00,545 --> 01:44:02,546
The witch has returned.

847
01:44:05,508 --> 01:44:09,177
Do not believe her lies.

848
01:44:09,554 --> 01:44:11,555
I come from a world
outside this place.

849
01:44:12,014 --> 01:44:13,807
I come from a world full of life!

850
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:18,812
Why don't you tell them the truth.

851
01:44:18,980 --> 01:44:22,440
Tell them the truth that you deny,
even to yourself.

852
01:44:22,608 --> 01:44:24,818
There was no apocalypse!

853
01:44:24,986 --> 01:44:27,070
You burned in the fire
that you started...

854
01:44:27,238 --> 01:44:30,574
...and nothing can save you
because you're already damned!

855
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:33,743
- Mommy!
- Take her.

856
01:44:34,078 --> 01:44:36,496
Burn her. Burn her as a witch.

857
01:44:37,081 --> 01:44:39,749
Burn her! Burn her!

858
01:44:40,084 --> 01:44:41,418
Demon witch!

859
01:44:41,586 --> 01:44:43,211
- Burn me?
- Demon witch.

860
01:44:43,379 --> 01:44:45,338
That's your answer.

861
01:44:45,882 --> 01:44:47,883
Burn anything you're afraid of.

862
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:50,595
Burn anything you can't control.

863
01:44:52,472 --> 01:44:55,933
This woman uses your fear
to control you.

864
01:44:56,101 --> 01:44:58,687
She led you to burn
Alessa Gillespie.

865
01:44:58,855 --> 01:45:01,732
She led you to burn
an innocent child.

866
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:05,110
But you will not deny your guilt...

867
01:45:05,278 --> 01:45:07,863
...and you cannot deny her pain!

868
01:45:08,031 --> 01:45:11,241
That child was sin incarnate.

869
01:45:11,701 --> 01:45:15,287
No, it's you who have sinned.

870
01:45:16,497 --> 01:45:19,583
You darkened the heart
of an innocent...

871
01:45:19,751 --> 01:45:23,629
...and now you cower in the face
of Alessa's revenge.

872
01:45:23,796 --> 01:45:25,797
- Sinner.
- Heresy.

873
01:45:25,965 --> 01:45:28,050
Burn her. Burn her!

874
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:33,430
Your faith brings death!

875
01:45:34,766 --> 01:45:36,725
You are alone in this limbo...

876
01:45:36,893 --> 01:45:39,686
...and God is not here.

877
01:45:41,064 --> 01:45:42,147
Mommy!

878
01:45:55,497 --> 01:45:59,583
She was a blasphemer.

879
01:46:00,377 --> 01:46:07,675
Blasphemer!

880
01:47:23,211 --> 01:47:25,004
What have you done?

881
01:47:25,881 --> 01:47:27,840
You've brought the darkness in
with you.

882
01:47:28,885 --> 01:47:30,969
Do you know what you've done?

883
01:47:40,104 --> 01:47:42,022
For Sharon.

884
01:47:46,694 --> 01:47:48,445
Mommy.

885
01:47:48,613 --> 01:47:51,491
Mommy. Mommy.

886
01:49:04,984 --> 01:49:06,609
Mommy!

887
01:49:35,515 --> 01:49:39,477
Oh, Lord, give me the strength
to stay pure.

888
01:50:13,722 --> 01:50:16,265
No! No!

889
01:50:48,258 --> 01:50:52,427
Alessa, what have you become?

890
01:51:06,485 --> 01:51:08,403
Mommy!

891
01:51:09,613 --> 01:51:13,074
Sharon! Sharon, honey, it's me.
It's Mommy.

892
01:51:34,305 --> 01:51:35,680
Down! We're getting down.

893
01:51:35,848 --> 01:51:38,309
Shut your eyes.
Shut your eyes, baby.

894
01:51:39,352 --> 01:51:52,072
Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes.

895
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:55,785
It's just a bad dream.
It's just a bad dream.

896
01:52:44,419 --> 01:52:47,923
Why did she not take me
with the others?

897
01:52:49,759 --> 01:52:51,927
Because you're her mother.

898
01:52:56,808 --> 01:52:59,851
Mother is God in the eyes of a child.

899
01:53:27,922 --> 01:53:29,798
I love you.

900
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:41,207
- Hi, this is Chris.
- And this is Rose.

901
01:54:41,374 --> 01:54:43,209
And I'm Sharon Da Silva.

902
01:54:43,376 --> 01:54:45,795
Please leave a message!

903
01:54:47,714 --> 01:54:50,341
Christopher, it's me.

904
01:54:50,884 --> 01:54:52,218
I'm with Sharon.

905
01:54:54,262 --> 01:54:57,681
Hello? Hello? Rose?

906
01:54:58,099 --> 01:54:59,558
Rose?

907
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,778
Yeah. We're coming home.
