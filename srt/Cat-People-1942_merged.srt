1
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:12,334
Thank you.

2
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:24,876
You won't believe this,
you've probably heard it before...

3
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:26,811
...but I've never known any artists.

4
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,382
- I am not an artist.
- Well, what's all this?

5
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:33,351
I do sketches for fashion drawings.

6
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:36,387
- May I see it?
- Oh, no, it's not good.

7
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,257
If I let you see it, you might not
want to know any artists, ever.

8
00:02:40,564 --> 00:02:44,022
I'm afraid it would have to be pretty bad
to do that. Besides, look:

9
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:46,930
"Let no one say,
and say it to your shame... "

10
00:03:12,028 --> 00:03:14,519
Irena Dubrovna, is that a Russian name?

11
00:03:14,698 --> 00:03:17,599
- No, I'm from Serbia.
- Oh, I see.

12
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,462
Would you mind spelling it?

13
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,365
Want to know
how to spell my name?

14
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:26,036
- Are you going to write me a letter?
- I'd like to write you a letter.

15
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:28,234
- What about?
- I would say in this letter:

16
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:32,040
"Dear Miss Dubrovna... "
I would say, "Will you have tea with me?"

17
00:03:33,283 --> 00:03:36,184
In that case, I'd just have
to write you another one. I'd say...

18
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:37,980
Here's my house.

19
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:45,085
Perhaps, Mr. Reed, you would like
to have tea in my apartment?

20
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:48,428
Oh, Miss Dubrovna...

21
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:50,793
...you make life so simple.

22
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:03,842
You know...

23
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:08,578
...I never cease to marvel at what lies
behind a brownstone front.

24
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,692
- Well, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

25
00:04:19,996 --> 00:04:21,224
But you...

26
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:25,892
- You looked at me in such a funny way.
- I've never had anyone here.

27
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:28,660
You're the first friend
I met in America.

28
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:30,836
Oh, I know lots of people in business.

29
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:35,137
Editors, secretaries,
other sketch artists, you know.

30
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:40,544
- But you might be my first real friend.
- Thank you.

31
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,324
- Nice.
- That's Lalage.

32
00:04:51,494 --> 00:04:54,190
- Lalage?
- The perfume I use. I like it.

33
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:58,801
Perhaps too well. Maybe I use
too much of it, living alone like this.

34
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:02,769
It's hard to describe.
Not like flowers, exactly. It's...

35
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:05,099
It's like something warm and living.

36
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:32,264
What's that?

37
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:36,531
It's the lions in the zoo.
One can hear them here often.

38
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:41,109
Many people in this building complain.
The roaring keeps them awake.

39
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:43,370
- And you don't mind it?
- No.

40
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:46,777
To me, it's the way the sound
of the sea is to others:

41
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,852
Natural and soothing. I like it.

42
00:05:52,555 --> 00:05:55,786
Some nights there is another sound,
the panther.

43
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,484
It screams like a woman.

44
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:00,686
I don't like that.

45
00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:03,859
Oh, I hadn't realized how dark
it was getting.

46
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:09,271
I like the dark. It's friendly.

47
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,773
No, no, keep still, please.

48
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:38,365
- Are you admiring my statue?
- Not exactly.

49
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:40,560
- Who's it supposed to be?
- King John.

50
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:43,171
Oh, King John, the Magna Carta
and all that stuff?

51
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,773
No. King John of Serbia.

52
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:47,807
He was a fine king.

53
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:51,344
He drove the Mamluks out of Serbia
and freed the people.

54
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:55,073
- Well, why have this around?
- Well, perhaps you have in your room...

55
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:58,379
...a picture of George Washington
or Abraham Lincoln.

56
00:06:58,555 --> 00:07:00,147
Well, what does it mean?

57
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:04,384
- Why is he...? Why is he spearing that cat?
- Oh, it's not really a cat.

58
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:09,555
It's meant to represent the evil ways
into which my village had once fallen.

59
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:14,091
You see, the Mamluks
came to Serbia long ago...

60
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,295
...and they made the people slaves.

61
00:07:16,673 --> 00:07:18,971
Well, at first, the people were good...

62
00:07:19,142 --> 00:07:22,634
...and worshipped God
in a true Christian way.

63
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:26,680
But little by little, the people changed.

64
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:30,846
When King John drove out
the Mamluks...

65
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,716
...and came to our village...

66
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,324
...he found dreadful things.

67
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:39,918
People bowed down to Satan...

68
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:42,428
...and said their Masses to him.

69
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,260
They had become witches...

70
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:48,495
...and were evil.

71
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:52,635
Well, King John put some of them
to the sword...

72
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:54,805
...but some...

73
00:07:54,978 --> 00:07:58,573
...the wisest and the most wicked...

74
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:01,816
...escaped into the mountains.

75
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:04,713
Now do you understand?

76
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:07,652
Well, I still don't see
what it has to do with you.

77
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:13,455
Those who escaped,
the wicked ones...

78
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,157
...their legend haunts the village
where I was born.

79
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:29,209
Boys who come to tea
can't expect to stay to dinner.

80
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,313
Some other time perhaps.

81
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:36,950
Tomorrow?

82
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:43,459
Well, what time tomorrow?

83
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:45,218
Dinner?

84
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:14,789
A little more to the left, Harry.

85
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,825
Easy. Just a hair.

86
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:24,023
- I'm afraid she's gonna be all right, Alice.
- She's got what it takes, commodore.

87
00:09:47,824 --> 00:09:50,452
Isn't it a darling?

88
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:53,919
- Where'd you get it?
- I bought it.

89
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:57,362
- You're not going in for cats, are you?
- No, I bought it for a friend.

90
00:09:57,533 --> 00:10:00,730
We arrive at the inescapable conclusion
that our Oliver has a girl.

91
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:02,268
A brilliant deduction, Carver.

92
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:04,599
- I want to show you something.
- A girlfriend?

93
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:06,765
- A girl.
- Anybody I know?

94
00:10:06,943 --> 00:10:08,740
Not yet, but I know you'll like her.

95
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:11,446
Well, if you like her,
she's okay with me.

96
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:26,284
- Well, hello.
- Look, Irena. I brought you a present.

97
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:44,474
Why, you little devil.

98
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:48,073
Oh, it's all right.

99
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:51,311
It's just that cats
don't seem to like me.

100
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:53,216
Yeah, but this is only a kitten.

101
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:55,987
It's very friendly.
When I had it in the office...

102
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,821
...Alice, that's the girl who works
in our department...

103
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:00,428
...it played with her.

104
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:04,563
Cats just don't like me.

105
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:06,292
Oh, I know what we can do.

106
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:09,437
- You got it at a pet store, didn't you?
- Yes.

107
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:12,938
Good. Well, we could exchange it
for some other pet.

108
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:16,140
I'll get my coat.

109
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:47,902
- I'd like to exchange this kitten for a canary.
- You'll have to talk louder.

110
00:11:48,144 --> 00:11:52,376
- What did you say?
- I can't understand a word you say.

111
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:02,157
I can't imagine what...

112
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:05,089
Oh, landie, dearie me. I can't imagine
what got into them.

113
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:06,558
All that caterwauling.

114
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:09,425
The last time they did that was
when an alley cat got in...

115
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,499
...and ate up one of my
nice Rice finches.

116
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,828
I wanted to exchange this kitten
for a bird.

117
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:16,198
Why, of course.
I have some lovely canaries.

118
00:12:16,372 --> 00:12:20,240
One little lemon-colored fellow
with top notes like Caruso.

119
00:12:24,113 --> 00:12:25,876
As peaceful as my dream of heaven.

120
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:29,245
Shall we go back now
and select just which little birdie?

121
00:12:29,452 --> 00:12:32,683
You go, please, Oliver.
You pick the one you like.

122
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:34,856
I'd rather stay here.

123
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:38,221
Of course. I'll only be a minute.

124
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:40,892
Animals are ever so psychic.

125
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:43,429
There are some people
who just can't come in here.

126
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:45,328
My dear brother's wife, for instance.

127
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:48,664
She's a very nice girl.
I have nothing against her...

128
00:12:48,838 --> 00:12:52,740
...but you just should see what happens
when she puts her foot inside this place.

129
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:55,469
The cats particularly.
They seem to know.

130
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:59,342
You can fool everybody, but landie,
dearie me, you can't fool a cat.

131
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:03,383
They seem to know who's not right,
if you know what I mean.

132
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:06,920
Here we are.
Isn't he a ducky little angel?

133
00:13:10,126 --> 00:13:12,253
- This is it.
- Thank you.

134
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:29,539
- What do you think of it?
- Oh, he is sweet.

135
00:13:29,712 --> 00:13:31,577
He will like me very much.
You will see.

136
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:35,979
- I like to be liked.
- That ought to be easy. Really easy.

137
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:51,229
- Irena.
- Yes.

138
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:54,901
- I've been asleep.
- I know.

139
00:13:55,538 --> 00:13:57,699
It couldn't have been
very entertaining for you.

140
00:13:58,341 --> 00:14:00,309
I was watching you.

141
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,268
And that was fun?

142
00:14:04,914 --> 00:14:06,745
Do you love me, Irena?

143
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:12,353
You know I love you, don't you?

144
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:19,995
I've never kissed you.

145
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:23,222
Do you know, that's funny.

146
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:27,693
- Why?
- Well...

147
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,765
When people in America are in love,
or even think they're in love...

148
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:34,409
...they've usually kissed long ago.

149
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:38,903
Well?

150
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:45,116
Irena, what's wrong?

151
00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:49,520
I've lived in dread of this moment.

152
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,854
I've never wanted to love you.

153
00:14:55,464 --> 00:14:58,331
I've stayed away from people...

154
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:01,493
...I lived alone.

155
00:15:03,072 --> 00:15:06,769
- I never wanted this to happen.
- But you just told me you love me.

156
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:08,768
I do.

157
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,076
I do.

158
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:14,312
I've fled from the past...

159
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:17,578
...from things you could never know...

160
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,683
...or understand.

161
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,687
Evil things.

162
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,249
Evil.

163
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:27,925
Irena...

164
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:30,065
...you've told me something
of the past.

165
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:32,632
About King John and the witches
in the village...

166
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:34,702
...and the cat people
descended from them.

167
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,360
They're fairy tales, Irena.

168
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:39,702
Fairy tales heard in your childhood.
Nothing more than that.

169
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:42,035
They've nothing to do with you, really.

170
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:45,372
You're Irena.
You're here in America.

171
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:49,482
You're so normal, you're in love with me,
Oliver Reed, a good, plain Americano.

172
00:15:49,752 --> 00:15:51,777
You're so normal,
you're gonna marry me...

173
00:15:51,954 --> 00:15:56,414
...and those fairy tales, you can tell them
to our children. They'll love them.

174
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:19,545
Comitadji.

175
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:24,049
Oh, Mr. Carver, you should not call
a good man that.

176
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,848
But it's Serbian. I got it
from my barber this afternoon.

177
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:28,513
But you might insult him.

178
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:33,151
- Comitadji means "thief," "bandit. "
- I've been double-crossed.

179
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:41,028
Oliver's bride seems to be a very nice girl.
And a very pretty one too.

180
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:44,101
Carver tells me she's a bit odd.

181
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:47,731
- He's worried about the marriage.
- Nonsense, Irena's a grand girl.

182
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:50,275
She and Oliver are going
to be very happy together.

183
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:51,708
I certainly hope so.

184
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:58,044
- To the bride.
- To the bride.

185
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:11,525
Look at that woman.
Isn't she something?

186
00:17:15,538 --> 00:17:16,766
Looks like a cat.

187
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,310
Thank you so much
for this lovely party, Alice.

188
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:24,737
I didn't know
there was a Serbian restaurant.

189
00:17:24,914 --> 00:17:27,178
Anything you want to know
about this city, ask me.

190
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,408
I know all the unimportant details.

191
00:17:57,346 --> 00:17:59,143
Well, how do you like that?

192
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:01,340
What did that woman
say to you, darling?

193
00:18:02,618 --> 00:18:04,347
Well, what did she say?

194
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:07,387
Now, wait a minute.
It can't be that serious.

195
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:08,921
Just one single word.

196
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:10,718
She greeted me.

197
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,591
She called me sister.

198
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,789
You saw her, Oliver.

199
00:18:16,966 --> 00:18:19,730
- You saw what she looked like.
- Oh, the cat people.

200
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:24,271
She looks like a cat, so she must be one
of the cat people. One of King John's pets.

201
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,965
Irena, you crazy kid.

202
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:33,477
I know a joke about weddings.

203
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:36,948
Why would my wedding
be a dollar-and-cents wedding, eh?

204
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:38,550
All right, why?

205
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:40,951
I haven't a dollar,
and me girl hasn't any sense.

206
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:45,389
- That's a corny joke even for you, doc.
- Come on, Carver.

207
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:05,140
What is it, darling?

208
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:09,684
I'm... I'm going to beg.

209
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:13,683
Mrs. Reed.

210
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:17,857
It's nice to hear that. Nice.

211
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:22,263
- I want to be Mrs. Reed.
- Well, you are.

212
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:25,531
But I want to be Mrs. Reed really.

213
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:29,194
I want to be everything
that name means to me.

214
00:19:30,105 --> 00:19:32,767
And I can't. I can't.

215
00:19:33,342 --> 00:19:34,809
Oliver...

216
00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:37,578
...be kind, be patient.

217
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:39,542
Let me have time.

218
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:43,546
Time to get over that feeling
there's something evil in me.

219
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:45,577
Darling...

220
00:19:46,422 --> 00:19:49,550
...you can have all the time
there is in the world if you want it...

221
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:52,057
...and all the patience
and kindness there's in me.

222
00:19:53,128 --> 00:19:55,028
Only a little time, Oliver.

223
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:57,865
I don't want more than that.

224
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:13,639
Good night, Irena.

225
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:35,735
Good night, Oliver.

226
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:37,769
Good night, Irena.

227
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:05,289
Well, ain't seen you here
in some time, ma'am.

228
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:08,368
I've been married.
I've been married for almost a month.

229
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:10,329
That's what I tell this critter.

230
00:21:10,506 --> 00:21:13,566
Nobody comes to see him
when they're happy. No, sir.

231
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:16,336
The monkey house and the aviary
gets the happy customers.

232
00:21:16,512 --> 00:21:18,002
But he's beautiful.

233
00:21:19,214 --> 00:21:20,704
No, he ain't beautiful.

234
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,050
He's an evil critter, ma'am.

235
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:27,211
You read your Bible. In Revelations...

236
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:30,381
...where the book's talking about
the worst beast of them all.

237
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,924
It says:

238
00:21:32,094 --> 00:21:34,358
"And the beast which I saw...

239
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,361
...was like unto a leopard. "

240
00:21:36,598 --> 00:21:39,328
- Like unto a leopard.
- Yes, ma'am.

241
00:21:39,568 --> 00:21:42,765
Like a leopard, but not a leopard.

242
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:44,906
I guess that fits this fella.

243
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:47,201
Yes, it fits him.

244
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:57,752
Best wishes for your marriage, ma'am.

245
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:26,133
Would you like some sherry?

246
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,273
If you're determined to mourn that bird,
we'll have a regular wake.

247
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:41,507
It's not just because the bird died.

248
00:24:41,683 --> 00:24:43,116
It's me.

249
00:24:43,285 --> 00:24:46,914
I envy every woman I see on the street.

250
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:50,650
- They can't match your little finger.
- I envy them.

251
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:54,785
They are happy.
They make their husbands happy.

252
00:24:54,963 --> 00:24:57,864
They lead normal, happy lives.

253
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:00,866
They're free.

254
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:10,871
- Do you know what happened to the bird?
- It died.

255
00:25:11,046 --> 00:25:14,140
It died of fright when I tried
to take it in my hand.

256
00:25:14,316 --> 00:25:16,784
All right, the bird was afraid of you.
That's nothing.

257
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:18,852
I had a rabbit once that hated me...

258
00:25:19,021 --> 00:25:21,649
...yet I grew up to be
quite a nice fella.

259
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:25,454
Oliver.

260
00:25:27,196 --> 00:25:30,029
When I went past
the panther's cage...

261
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:32,690
...I had to open the box.

262
00:25:33,335 --> 00:25:35,701
I had to throw the bird to him.

263
00:25:36,371 --> 00:25:40,865
Do you understand?
I had to. I had to do it.

264
00:25:45,013 --> 00:25:47,140
That's what frightens me.

265
00:25:56,925 --> 00:26:00,952
Irena, I've been trying
to kid you out of it.

266
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:02,391
Maybe that's wrong.

267
00:26:02,564 --> 00:26:06,295
- I've tried to...
- No one could have been more gentle...

268
00:26:06,468 --> 00:26:07,696
...or more patient.

269
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:11,168
I've tried to make you realize
all these stories are so much nonsense.

270
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:15,737
But now I see it's not the stories.
It's the fact that you believe them.

271
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:18,410
We've got to have help, Irena.

272
00:26:23,085 --> 00:26:24,313
Not that sort of help.

273
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:28,113
There's something wrong, and we have
to face it in an intelligent way.

274
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,418
We don't need a King John
with fire and sword.

275
00:26:31,593 --> 00:26:35,586
We need someone who can find
the reason for your belief and cure it.

276
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:39,397
That's what we need.

277
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:41,827
A psychiatrist.

278
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:44,428
Oh, find one for me, Oliver.

279
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,803
The best one. The very best one.

280
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:52,572
You were saying, the cats...

281
00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:55,344
They torment me.

282
00:26:56,285 --> 00:26:57,718
I wake in the night...

283
00:26:58,253 --> 00:27:02,246
...and the tread of their feet
whispers in my brain.

284
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:05,784
I have no peace...

285
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:09,320
...for they are in me.

286
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,566
In me.

287
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:16,633
In me.

288
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:45,357
Hypnosis always tires me.

289
00:27:45,534 --> 00:27:48,162
Some of my patients, too,
find it exhausting.

290
00:27:48,503 --> 00:27:51,700
It's only that I remember nothing.

291
00:27:51,873 --> 00:27:55,240
It's my duty to remember.
I have it all here.

292
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,738
Most interesting.

293
00:27:57,112 --> 00:28:01,378
You told me of your village
and the people and their strange beliefs.

294
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,077
I am so ashamed.
It must seem so childish.

295
00:28:05,253 --> 00:28:08,416
And the cat women of your village too.
You told me of them.

296
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:12,218
Women who, in jealousy or anger
or out of their own corrupt passions...

297
00:28:12,394 --> 00:28:15,488
...can change into great cats,
like panthers.

298
00:28:16,431 --> 00:28:18,729
And if one of these women
were to fall in love...

299
00:28:18,934 --> 00:28:21,960
...and if her lover were to kiss her,
take her into his embrace...

300
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:25,072
...she would be driven by her own evil
to kill him.

301
00:28:26,108 --> 00:28:29,271
That's what you believe and fear,
isn't it?

302
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:33,780
These things are very simple
to psychiatrists.

303
00:28:35,717 --> 00:28:37,651
You told me about your childhood.

304
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:41,550
Perhaps we will find this trouble stems
from some early experience.

305
00:28:41,823 --> 00:28:43,950
You said you didn't know your father.

306
00:28:44,126 --> 00:28:48,153
That he died in some mysterious
accident in the forest before your birth.

307
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,561
And because of that, the children
teased you and called your mother...

308
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:53,826
...a witch, a cat woman.

309
00:28:55,637 --> 00:28:59,971
These childhood tragedies
are inclined to corrode the soul...

310
00:29:00,142 --> 00:29:02,337
...to leave a canker in the mind.

311
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:04,877
But we will try to repair the damage.

312
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:07,872
You're not to worry.

313
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:10,381
And what shall I tell my husband?

314
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:13,112
Naturally, he is anxious
to have some word.

315
00:29:13,288 --> 00:29:16,746
What does one tell a husband?
One tells him nothing.

316
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,670
Alice, it's so nice to see you.

317
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:34,302
Hello, darling.

318
00:29:34,476 --> 00:29:36,910
- How did you make out with Louis?
- Louis?

319
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:38,840
Dr. Judd.

320
00:29:39,748 --> 00:29:40,976
Alice knows, darling.

321
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:46,453
Of course. Didn't I suggest Dr. Judd?
I met him on the commodore's boat.

322
00:29:46,621 --> 00:29:49,647
The way he goes around kissing hands
makes me want to spit cotton.

323
00:29:50,025 --> 00:29:52,960
But I guess he knows all
there is to know about psychiatry.

324
00:29:57,365 --> 00:29:59,890
I told Alice. I knew she'd know
some good doctor.

325
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:03,837
I don't see why that was necessary.

326
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:08,810
Sorry. I seem to have put
my big foot in it.

327
00:30:14,316 --> 00:30:16,011
I'm sorry, Irena.

328
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:19,551
I'm sure neither Oliver nor I
had any notion of offending you.

329
00:30:19,855 --> 00:30:21,880
I'm dreadfully sorry.

330
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,490
Goodbye, Alice.

331
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:37,332
- Darling, really, there's no reason to...
- But, Oliver...

332
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:39,406
...how can you discuss such things?

333
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:43,806
Such intimate things about me?
How much did you tell her?

334
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:47,312
You can tell Alice anything. She's
a good egg, she understands anything.

335
00:30:47,482 --> 00:30:51,612
There are some things a woman doesn't
want other women to understand.

336
00:31:56,284 --> 00:31:57,546
Irena.

337
00:32:01,022 --> 00:32:03,889
I woke up. You were gone.

338
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:07,654
- What's wrong, darling?
- I couldn't sleep. I went out.

339
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:10,729
- Where'd you go?
- Just walked.

340
00:32:10,932 --> 00:32:12,957
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

341
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,828
I just didn't think.

342
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:18,666
Oliver...

343
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,865
...we should never quarrel.

344
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:23,909
Never let me feel jealousy or anger.

345
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,072
Whatever is in me is held in,
is kept harmless...

346
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:29,682
...when I am happy.

347
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:32,012
I'd turn handsprings, darling.

348
00:32:32,187 --> 00:32:34,849
I'd dance in the streets
to make you happy.

349
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,122
Toward the sheer line.

350
00:32:46,468 --> 00:32:48,333
Sixty-two degrees.

351
00:32:49,838 --> 00:32:51,203
Hey.

352
00:32:53,341 --> 00:32:57,277
I'm sorry. I must have given you
the wrong figure. Let me try again.

353
00:32:57,445 --> 00:32:59,072
Wait, let's have a cigarette first.

354
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:02,375
That's the third wrong figure
you've given me this morning.

355
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,575
Getting careless in my old age.

356
00:33:04,753 --> 00:33:08,086
Something's on your mind.
Anything wrong?

357
00:33:09,124 --> 00:33:10,489
Nope.

358
00:33:13,928 --> 00:33:15,725
Must be marriage.

359
00:33:17,332 --> 00:33:19,300
Well, in a way, it is.

360
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:21,393
I'm worried about Irena.

361
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:24,060
But I thought she was going
to Dr. Judd.

362
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:27,572
Yeah, that's what I thought.
But I ran into Dr. Judd this morning.

363
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:29,801
She hasn't been back
since the first visit.

364
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:33,345
But you told me she seemed
so anxious to be cured.

365
00:33:34,282 --> 00:33:37,581
- Apparently not.
- I'm sorry, Ollie.

366
00:33:37,752 --> 00:33:40,084
Must make you very unhappy.

367
00:33:41,356 --> 00:33:43,449
You know, it's a funny thing.

368
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,025
I've never been unhappy before.

369
00:33:47,395 --> 00:33:51,695
Things have always gone swell for me.
I had a grand time as a kid.

370
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:53,959
Lots of fun at school...

371
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:57,901
...and here at the office with you
and the commodore and doc.

372
00:33:59,274 --> 00:34:02,334
That's why I don't know
what to do about all this.

373
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:04,634
I've just never been unhappy.

374
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:09,683
Hey.

375
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:13,651
Now, wait a minute.

376
00:34:20,662 --> 00:34:24,393
I can't help it.
I just can't help it.

377
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:27,566
I can't bear to see you unhappy.

378
00:34:27,736 --> 00:34:31,467
I love you too darn much,
and I don't care if you do know it, Ollie.

379
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,368
I love you.

380
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:38,035
I'm sorry. Forget it.

381
00:34:38,213 --> 00:34:41,876
- There's Irena, you're in love with her.
- I don't know.

382
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:46,315
All this trouble has made me think...

383
00:34:47,422 --> 00:34:49,982
...I don't know what love really is.

384
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:52,082
I don't know...

385
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,060
...even whether I'm in love with Irena.
- I know what love is.

386
00:34:56,397 --> 00:34:58,297
It's understanding.

387
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,101
It's you and me,
and let the rest of the world go by.

388
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,873
It's just the two of us living our lives
together, happily and proudly.

389
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:09,541
No self-torture and no doubt.

390
00:35:10,178 --> 00:35:12,408
It's enduring and it's everlasting.

391
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,580
Nothing can change it.

392
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:17,210
Nothing can change us, Ollie.

393
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,346
That's what I think love is.

394
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:21,486
Well...

395
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,388
...that isn't the way
I feel about Irena.

396
00:35:25,393 --> 00:35:27,156
It's a different feeling.

397
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:30,822
I'm drawn to her.

398
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:33,957
There's a warmth from her...

399
00:35:34,636 --> 00:35:36,695
...that pulls at me.

400
00:35:36,938 --> 00:35:39,771
I have to watch her
when she's in the room.

401
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:42,569
I have to touch her when she's near.

402
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:46,906
But I don't really know her.

403
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:49,572
In many ways, we're strangers.

404
00:35:50,385 --> 00:35:52,319
You and I...

405
00:35:53,021 --> 00:35:55,512
...we'll never be strangers.

406
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:27,950
You forgot your key.

407
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:30,989
Oh, I'm always forgetting it.
But ain't no worry in it.

408
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,923
Nobody would want to steal
one of them critters.

409
00:36:41,603 --> 00:36:44,128
You resist temptation admirably.

410
00:36:44,305 --> 00:36:47,138
- Temptation?
- The key.

411
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:50,140
- Why would I want it?
- For many reasons.

412
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:55,010
There is, in some cases, a psychic
need to loose evil upon the world.

413
00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:58,311
And we all of us carry within us
a desire for death.

414
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:02,479
You fear the panther, yet you're drawn
to him again and again.

415
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:06,254
Couldn't you turn to him
as an instrument of death?

416
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:11,054
You didn't come back to see me Friday,
I've had to come to you.

417
00:37:11,232 --> 00:37:15,635
- Well, how did you know where to find me?
- You told me many things.

418
00:37:16,504 --> 00:37:18,665
Why didn't you come back?

419
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,899
I don't feel you can help me.

420
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:23,509
You're very wise,
you know a great deal...

421
00:37:23,678 --> 00:37:27,444
...yet when you speak of the soul,
you mean the mind.

422
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:31,608
- And it is not my mind that is troubled.
- What a clever girl.

423
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:34,380
All the psychologists
have tried for years to find...

424
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:36,750
...that subtle difference
between mind and soul.

425
00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:38,187
And you found it.

426
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:40,759
It does seem presumptuous of me,
doesn't it?

427
00:37:41,362 --> 00:37:42,886
Goodbye, doctor.

428
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:02,314
Irena.

429
00:38:11,392 --> 00:38:13,917
I'm worried. What's happening to us?

430
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:15,824
I love you, Oliver.

431
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:18,090
I know, but people can love...

432
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:20,632
...and people can still drift apart.

433
00:38:20,802 --> 00:38:23,566
And that's what I feel
is happening to us.

434
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,072
We don't talk together openly.

435
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,505
- You're not frank with me.
- I've never lied to you.

436
00:38:31,346 --> 00:38:34,008
I ran into Dr. Judd today.

437
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,085
- You haven't been back to see him.
- He cannot help me.

438
00:38:39,253 --> 00:38:42,984
Well, you won't let him help you.
You won't let me help you.

439
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:44,556
You won't even help yourself.

440
00:38:44,892 --> 00:38:46,757
It's what I said to Alice
this afternoon.

441
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:48,919
- You're content to go on as we are...
- Alice.

442
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:56,762
Oh, I... I promised you
we'd never quarrel.

443
00:38:58,439 --> 00:38:59,770
Let's calm down a bit.

444
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:04,003
I'll go back to the office.

445
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:06,747
I've got some work to do.

446
00:39:30,538 --> 00:39:32,870
Oh, do you wanna go up
to the office, Mr. Reed?

447
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:37,171
I think I'll go around to Sally Lunn's, get
a cup of coffee before I get to work.

448
00:39:37,345 --> 00:39:39,108
I'll be back.

449
00:39:54,162 --> 00:39:56,596
- Hello, Mr. Reed.
- Minnie.

450
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:58,994
Maybe you'd like some nice
chicken gumbo today?

451
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:00,759
No, thanks, Minnie.

452
00:40:00,935 --> 00:40:03,495
How about some apple pie
and a cup of coffee?

453
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:05,002
Yes, sir.

454
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:08,538
My goodness, don't nobody
like chicken gumbo?

455
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:29,228
Hello?

456
00:40:30,865 --> 00:40:31,854
Hello?

457
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,695
Hello?

458
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:36,097
Hello?

459
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:45,705
John Paul Jones, don't you hate
people who do that?

460
00:40:53,454 --> 00:40:54,853
Good night, John Paul.

461
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:13,234
Here, Mrs. Agnew, new
matchbooks for your collection.

462
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:15,068
Oh, thank you, Miss Moore.

463
00:41:15,243 --> 00:41:17,734
Chartreuse. Ain't that elegant?

464
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:20,513
Too bad you wasn't here
just a minute ago.

465
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:22,842
- Mr. Reed looked in.
- Oh, where did he go?

466
00:41:23,017 --> 00:41:25,008
Said he was going around
to Sally Lunn's.

467
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:28,849
- I'll see if I can catch him. Good night.
- Good night, Miss Moore.

468
00:41:36,364 --> 00:41:39,197
- Could you squeeze the coffee pot for me?
- Hello.

469
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:43,861
I sure could, only this coffee's
been working so long it's got muscles.

470
00:41:44,305 --> 00:41:47,741
What are you doing in this part of town
at this hour of night?

471
00:41:49,977 --> 00:41:51,638
Stormy weather.

472
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:06,886
You're going to have to solve
your problems your own way.

473
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:09,291
I'm going to drink up and go home.

474
00:42:11,632 --> 00:42:14,760
I think you'd better go home too
and make it up with Irena.

475
00:42:14,936 --> 00:42:17,166
Alice, you're very swell.

476
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:20,307
That's what makes me dangerous.
I'm the new type of other woman.

477
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:21,964
- Good night, Minnie.
- Good night.

478
00:42:22,143 --> 00:42:24,008
- Good night, Minnie.
- Good night.

479
00:42:33,788 --> 00:42:37,280
- You cold?
- A cat just walked over my grave.

480
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:47,030
Don't you want me to walk you home?

481
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:49,897
No, thanks. I'm a big girl now
and I'm not afraid.

482
00:42:50,071 --> 00:42:53,097
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

483
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

484
00:44:27,635 --> 00:44:31,332
Climb on, sister. Are you riding with me,
or ain't you?

485
00:44:33,808 --> 00:44:37,744
- You look as if you'd seen a ghost.
- Did you see it?

486
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:36,735
Taxi, lady?

487
00:46:02,563 --> 00:46:05,293
No, please, don't. Don't touch me.

488
00:46:08,102 --> 00:46:09,433
Irena.

489
00:46:10,104 --> 00:46:11,867
I'm sorry.

490
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:16,066
I've been worried to death.
I didn't know where you were. I thought...

491
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:21,713
What happened tonight
happens in every family.

492
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:23,941
I was all on edge.

493
00:46:24,285 --> 00:46:27,379
You've got to understand
and you've got to forgive me.

494
00:46:30,925 --> 00:46:32,893
I forgive you.

495
00:46:57,418 --> 00:46:59,613
- Irena.
- What?

496
00:47:00,654 --> 00:47:04,750
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

497
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:37,555
- to loose evil upon the world.

498
00:47:37,725 --> 00:47:42,856
There is, in some cases, a psychic
need to loose evil upon the world.

499
00:47:43,364 --> 00:47:48,199
There is, in some cases,
a psychic need, a desire for death.

500
00:47:48,836 --> 00:47:52,135
- to loose evil. A desire for death.

501
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:55,173
A psychic need. The key.

502
00:47:55,543 --> 00:47:57,340
The key.

503
00:47:57,611 --> 00:47:59,545
The key.

504
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:01,578
The key.

505
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,749
I'm afraid this is dull for Irena.

506
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:47,325
Darling, there are some
beautiful moderns upstairs.

507
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:50,793
- Why don't you take a look at them.
- But I like these little boats.

508
00:48:50,965 --> 00:48:52,557
I want to be with you.

509
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:54,963
- Don't send me away.
- We're not sending you away.

510
00:48:55,135 --> 00:48:57,126
We just don't want you to be bored.

511
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:01,768
We'll meet you in the main lobby
in an hour.

512
00:49:03,811 --> 00:49:06,837
Ollie, look, a drawing of the Victory.

513
00:49:07,081 --> 00:49:10,608
You know, that's the last man-of-war
with a lateen sail aft.

514
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:58,397
- Could I have the key to the swimming pool?
- Of course, dearie.

515
00:49:58,565 --> 00:50:00,089
What a darling kitten.

516
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:03,634
Yeah. It's one of four.
A tabby had them about a month ago.

517
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:09,703
- Turn the lights out when you're through.
- I won't forget.

518
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:11,607
Hello?

519
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,212
Yeah.

520
00:50:19,453 --> 00:50:22,183
- Just a moment, dearie. Yes?
- Is Miss Moore in?

521
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:24,449
She just went downstairs
to the swimming pool.

522
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:26,525
Would it be all right
if I went to see her?

523
00:50:26,694 --> 00:50:29,458
Of course, dearie.
Right down them steps there.

524
00:50:30,064 --> 00:50:32,123
Oh, gee, I can't tonight.

525
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

526
00:52:10,564 --> 00:52:12,054
Help!

527
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:17,293
Help!

528
00:52:20,574 --> 00:52:22,405
Gee whiz, Mrs. Hanson.

529
00:52:23,343 --> 00:52:25,641
Help!

530
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:38,190
What is the matter, Alice?

531
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,924
- Gee whiz, dearie, are you all right?
- It's nothing.

532
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:49,626
It was dark down here, and Mrs. Reed
coming in unexpectedly frightened me.

533
00:52:49,803 --> 00:52:51,168
I'm terribly sorry.

534
00:52:53,574 --> 00:52:56,042
No, don't go. I'm coming right out.

535
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:03,449
Sorry to have disturbed you, Alice.

536
00:53:03,617 --> 00:53:06,848
I missed you and Oliver,
and I thought you might know where he is.

537
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:11,354
We waited for you at the museum.
You'll probably find him at home.

538
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:14,255
If you don't mind then, I'll run on.

539
00:53:29,076 --> 00:53:32,011
- Could I have my robe, please?
- Sure.

540
00:53:34,114 --> 00:53:37,106
Gee whiz, honey, it's torn to ribbons.

541
00:53:50,764 --> 00:53:53,096
Thank you for coming
at so late an hour, Dr. Judd.

542
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,565
I phoned you because I'm troubled.
I think you can help me.

543
00:53:57,037 --> 00:53:59,335
How much do you believe
about the cat people?

544
00:53:59,506 --> 00:54:00,734
The cat people?

545
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:03,877
- The story Mrs. Reed told me?
- Yes.

546
00:54:04,044 --> 00:54:08,105
I believe, my dear Miss Moore,
exactly as I told Mrs. Reed:

547
00:54:08,282 --> 00:54:13,276
The story is a product of her own fear,
her own overworked imagination.

548
00:54:13,453 --> 00:54:16,183
What would you say, Dr. Judd,
if I were to tell you...

549
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:18,824
...that I believe Irena's story?
- Yes?

550
00:54:19,192 --> 00:54:21,990
Twice I've been followed
by something that was not human...

551
00:54:22,162 --> 00:54:24,926
...something that attempted
to take my life.

552
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:28,596
I believe that was the cat form
of Irena.

553
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:31,260
But why should she wish to harm you?

554
00:54:31,672 --> 00:54:33,606
Because I'm in love with her husband.

555
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,999
My dear Miss Moore...

556
00:54:36,176 --> 00:54:38,872
...this story grows more
and more charming.

557
00:54:39,046 --> 00:54:41,606
Simpler too, all the time.

558
00:54:42,683 --> 00:54:45,151
You're both victims of fear.

559
00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:48,982
Mrs. Reed fears the past,
and you fear the present.

560
00:54:49,156 --> 00:54:51,954
Mrs. Reed has a very strong
imagination...

561
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,150
...and you have
an equally strong conscience.

562
00:54:54,328 --> 00:54:56,990
Dr. Judd, the danger that threatened me
was very real.

563
00:54:57,164 --> 00:54:59,689
You disappoint me, Miss Moore.

564
00:55:01,535 --> 00:55:03,662
Here is my robe.

565
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:10,273
To understand this,
I should first have to hear...

566
00:55:10,444 --> 00:55:13,106
...Mrs. Reed's version of the story myself.

567
00:55:13,914 --> 00:55:16,144
That should be a most
interesting interview.

568
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:18,750
I shouldn't advise you
to see her alone.

569
00:55:18,919 --> 00:55:21,979
Do you think I'm afraid
of so charming a lady?

570
00:55:22,155 --> 00:55:25,283
Dr. Judd, I know you don't believe me,
but you must be careful.

571
00:55:25,459 --> 00:55:27,950
Oh, you want me to carry
some means of protection.

572
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:31,597
A gun, perhaps, with a silver bullet.
Is that what you mean?

573
00:55:31,765 --> 00:55:34,290
If you are lucky enough to have one.

574
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:37,300
Of course...

575
00:55:38,605 --> 00:55:40,664
...this isn't silver.

576
00:55:42,642 --> 00:55:44,337
Good night, Miss Moore.

577
00:55:50,817 --> 00:55:54,014
You say you have lapses of memory
for which you cannot account.

578
00:55:54,187 --> 00:55:56,519
They are becoming more frequent,
and you're afraid.

579
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,624
Help me.

580
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:01,352
I can't help you.
You're not truthful with me.

581
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:05,328
But I am. I've told you everything.
I have not lied to you.

582
00:56:05,499 --> 00:56:08,662
Do you sincerely believe that
if your husband were to kiss you...

583
00:56:08,835 --> 00:56:12,032
...you would change into a cat
and rend him to bits?

584
00:56:12,205 --> 00:56:15,106
I don't know. I am only afraid.

585
00:56:17,077 --> 00:56:19,341
And if I were to kiss you?

586
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,109
I only know that I should not like
to be kissed by you.

587
00:56:27,954 --> 00:56:30,479
My dear Mrs. Reed,
sometimes in my profession...

588
00:56:30,657 --> 00:56:33,922
...there comes a contest of wills
between the doctor and his patient.

589
00:56:34,694 --> 00:56:37,891
Patients are clever. Very clever.

590
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:41,091
And they can fool the doctor
sometimes.

591
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:45,837
You are very clever.

592
00:56:46,006 --> 00:56:49,237
And perhaps you enjoy this little game
you are having with me.

593
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:51,934
But I shall discover your secret.

594
00:56:52,112 --> 00:56:55,377
Dr. Judd, believe me.
I beg you to believe me.

595
00:56:55,549 --> 00:57:00,179
I have no secret. I told you everything.
I have not lied to you.

596
00:57:00,353 --> 00:57:02,446
I need your help.

597
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,990
I can't help you.

598
00:57:06,226 --> 00:57:08,251
But I can warn you.

599
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:10,988
These hallucinations approach insanity.

600
00:57:11,164 --> 00:57:15,123
This nonsense about Miss Moore
at the park and in the swimming pool...

601
00:57:15,302 --> 00:57:18,999
...it's a deterioration of the mind,
escape into fantasy.

602
00:57:19,172 --> 00:57:21,163
And it's dangerous.

603
00:57:22,142 --> 00:57:23,803
At this moment...

604
00:57:23,977 --> 00:57:27,970
...I could go before a board
and have you put away for observation.

605
00:57:28,148 --> 00:57:31,015
You are that close to real insanity.

606
00:57:35,856 --> 00:57:37,551
I can't help you.

607
00:57:37,724 --> 00:57:39,555
You can only help yourself.

608
00:57:39,726 --> 00:57:42,991
You keep going back
to the mad legends of your birthplace.

609
00:57:43,163 --> 00:57:44,926
Forget them.

610
00:57:45,098 --> 00:57:48,124
You surround yourself
with cat objects, pictures.

611
00:57:48,301 --> 00:57:51,702
Get rid of them. Lead a normal life.

612
00:57:52,706 --> 00:57:55,334
You know, for the first time
you've really helped me.

613
00:57:55,509 --> 00:57:58,205
Maybe it's because you interest me.

614
00:58:22,102 --> 00:58:23,660
Oliver.

615
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:26,362
I went back to Dr. Judd's office.

616
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:28,971
I'm no longer afraid.

617
00:58:30,076 --> 00:58:33,045
Believe me, Irena, I'd have been
the happiest man in the world...

618
00:58:33,213 --> 00:58:35,113
...if you told me that
a little while ago.

619
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:37,742
But things have changed.

620
00:58:39,085 --> 00:58:42,885
I had to learn, maybe through
this marriage of ours.

621
00:58:43,156 --> 00:58:45,420
I didn't want to tell you this...

622
00:58:45,725 --> 00:58:48,387
...but now, you see, I have to.

623
00:58:49,162 --> 00:58:50,959
I love Alice.

624
00:58:51,364 --> 00:58:53,355
Irena, it's too late.

625
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:55,160
Too late.

626
00:58:56,736 --> 00:58:59,796
Well, there seems only one decent thing
for me to do.

627
00:59:00,173 --> 00:59:02,403
I'll give you a divorce.

628
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,974
- Believe me, it's better this way.
- Better?

629
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:10,016
- Better for whom?
- Irena, I...

630
00:59:10,183 --> 00:59:11,912
Speak.

631
00:59:12,185 --> 00:59:14,176
You can't speak.

632
00:59:14,354 --> 00:59:16,515
There's nothing you can say.

633
00:59:17,924 --> 00:59:20,188
There's only silence.

634
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:27,226
But I love silence.

635
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,334
I love loneliness.

636
00:59:30,103 --> 00:59:32,071
And they... They are in me.

637
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:34,867
Their strength, warmth.

638
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:38,169
They're soft. They're soft.

639
00:59:38,345 --> 00:59:41,940
- Irena, you're talking like an insane woman.
- Please go.

640
00:59:43,283 --> 00:59:45,615
I want you to go, please.

641
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:47,713
Go.

642
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:49,517
Go.

643
01:00:14,881 --> 01:00:16,906
Bavarian cream?

644
01:00:20,186 --> 01:00:21,983
Roquefort?

645
01:00:23,923 --> 01:00:26,357
And you get the apple pie.

646
01:00:27,227 --> 01:00:30,355
I have pointed out
two alternatives, Mr. Reed:

647
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:33,124
Either have her put away
for observation and restraint...

648
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,165
...or have your marriage annulled.

649
01:00:35,335 --> 01:00:37,496
It's tough for Oliver
either way, doctor.

650
01:00:38,038 --> 01:00:41,405
As a psychiatrist, I should recommend
that you have her put away.

651
01:00:41,574 --> 01:00:44,839
As your friend, however, I have
much more reasonable advice to offer.

652
01:00:45,011 --> 01:00:47,172
I think you should have
your marriage annulled.

653
01:00:47,347 --> 01:00:49,907
In that way, you are free
of responsibility.

654
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:53,211
- You two could marry.
- And if Irena's sent away?

655
01:00:53,386 --> 01:00:56,719
The law is quite explicit.
One cannot divorce an insane person.

656
01:00:57,057 --> 01:00:59,457
If she's not well,
I've got to take care of her.

657
01:00:59,626 --> 01:01:01,184
It's the only right thing, Ollie.

658
01:01:01,361 --> 01:01:03,955
As you will. I'll have
the commitment papers drawn up...

659
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:07,258
...and arrange an interview
with Mrs. Reed at her apartment tonight.

660
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:09,197
Shall we say 6:00?

661
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,088
Let's not play that.

662
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:33,288
I don't think Irena's coming.
We've waited an hour and a half.

663
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:36,625
Perhaps it's useless to wait.

664
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:40,029
I don't think she intends coming.

665
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:42,865
She's probably walking in the park.

666
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:51,110
Ollie, let's get back to the office.
We've had a broken-up day...

667
01:01:51,277 --> 01:01:54,269
...and there's lots of work to be done.
- Suits me.

668
01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:19,599
How stupid of me, I left
my walking stick in the apartment.

669
01:02:19,773 --> 01:02:21,638
- I'll get it for you.
- No, it's my fault.

670
01:02:21,808 --> 01:02:24,038
Give me the key.
I shall only be a moment.

671
01:02:50,537 --> 01:02:52,505
Five and a half.

672
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:54,829
Five and a half.

673
01:02:55,008 --> 01:02:56,703
And...

674
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:01,307
...one and three-eighths.

675
01:03:01,748 --> 01:03:04,342
And one and three-eighths.

676
01:03:04,517 --> 01:03:06,144
There.

677
01:03:06,586 --> 01:03:08,417
I'll get it.

678
01:03:14,227 --> 01:03:15,524
Hello?

679
01:03:16,763 --> 01:03:18,128
Hello?

680
01:03:19,399 --> 01:03:20,798
Hello?

681
01:03:23,636 --> 01:03:25,661
They hung up on me.

682
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,534
- That's funny.
- What?

683
01:03:29,709 --> 01:03:32,109
It happened once before like that.

684
01:03:32,345 --> 01:03:34,973
The telephone rang, and I answered.

685
01:03:35,381 --> 01:03:37,713
There was someone
on the other end of the line.

686
01:03:37,884 --> 01:03:39,749
I could almost hear them listening.

687
01:03:39,919 --> 01:03:43,184
And then there was a little click
as they hung up the receiver.

688
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:47,055
That was the night
I was followed on the transverse.

689
01:03:47,293 --> 01:03:49,056
Ollie...

690
01:03:49,229 --> 01:03:51,754
...let's get out of here. I'm afraid.

691
01:03:52,365 --> 01:03:54,492
That was Irena.
I know it was Irena who called.

692
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:57,659
She could call from downstairs.
She may be on her way up now.

693
01:03:57,837 --> 01:03:59,566
Get your things.

694
01:04:04,777 --> 01:04:07,837
The door's open. We can see
to get out into the hall.

695
01:04:12,051 --> 01:04:14,451
I'll turn out the table lights.

696
01:04:17,023 --> 01:04:20,515
It's shut now.
Just a minute ago, it was open.

697
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,427
It's locked.

698
01:04:55,728 --> 01:04:57,093
Irena.

699
01:04:58,565 --> 01:05:00,089
Irena.

700
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:05,501
Leave us, Irena!

701
01:05:15,648 --> 01:05:18,776
In the name of God, leave us in peace.

702
01:05:35,301 --> 01:05:37,030
Come on.

703
01:05:57,323 --> 01:05:59,689
Let's go down the stairs.

704
01:06:07,266 --> 01:06:10,235
Don't, Alice. It's gone.
Everything's all right. Don't be afraid.

705
01:06:10,403 --> 01:06:12,303
I'm not afraid.

706
01:06:12,972 --> 01:06:14,803
Look.

707
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:21,607
Irena's perfume. Strong. Sweet.

708
01:06:32,358 --> 01:06:34,519
I need a drink.

709
01:06:56,382 --> 01:06:57,906
- Yes?
- Dr. Judd.

710
01:06:58,084 --> 01:06:59,278
Miss Moore?

711
01:06:59,452 --> 01:07:03,411
Yes. We've been trying to get you
on the phone, Dr. Judd. I called your hotel.

712
01:07:03,589 --> 01:07:07,491
Yes, I know, that's what
I want to talk about. Are you alone?

713
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:10,891
You'd better leave then.
She may be on her way back now.

714
01:07:11,264 --> 01:07:13,960
But she is dangerous, Dr. Judd.
I warn you.

715
01:07:16,335 --> 01:07:19,463
Hello? Hello, Dr. Judd?

716
01:07:22,608 --> 01:07:24,371
Dr. Judd?

717
01:07:25,111 --> 01:07:27,375
I think Irena just came in.
He hung up on me.

718
01:07:27,547 --> 01:07:29,139
Come on.

719
01:07:29,515 --> 01:07:31,415
We'll get a taxi.

720
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:35,414
You're late, aren't you?

721
01:07:35,588 --> 01:07:37,818
I kept my appointment.

722
01:07:38,691 --> 01:07:41,353
You see, I've never believed
your story.

723
01:07:42,762 --> 01:07:44,923
I am not afraid of you.

724
01:07:46,532 --> 01:07:48,693
I take you in my arms.

725
01:07:49,068 --> 01:07:52,435
So little, so soft.

726
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,405
This warm perfume in your hair.

727
01:07:55,575 --> 01:07:57,236
Your body.

728
01:07:59,278 --> 01:08:01,803
Don't be afraid of me, Irena.

729
01:09:27,567 --> 01:09:29,262
He's dead.

730
01:09:31,003 --> 01:09:34,131
Mr. Reed. Oh, Mr. Reed.

731
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,104
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Reed.

732
01:09:42,281 --> 01:09:45,614
Sue Ellen and I phoned the police
just as soon as we heard the racket.

733
01:09:49,856 --> 01:09:51,585
Thank you.

734
01:10:02,335 --> 01:10:04,496
Sue Ellen, you know better than that.

735
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:08,367
You're not supposed to touch anything
until the police get here.

736
01:10:08,574 --> 01:10:10,838
- The sword cane.
- Broken. Half of it's gone.

737
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:13,501
We've got to find her. Come on.

738
01:12:03,689 --> 01:12:05,953
She never lied to us.
