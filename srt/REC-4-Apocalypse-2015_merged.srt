1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,593
No detailed information has been received
from the centre of Barcelona so far.

2
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:15,765
A whole building has been closed off
as a preventative measure

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,934
due to an unknown virus...

4
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:20,228
...more than 20 people are trapped
inside the building.

5
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:25,024
Other than the residents inside,
there are police officers and fire fighters

6
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,278
and among them, two TV reporters
that are accompanying them...

7
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,907
It has not been clarified as to
what type of virus it is.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,036
Neither the authorities
nor specialists have yet been able...

9
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,748
...according to the last contact with the
inside, there may be only one survivor.

10
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:45,128
It appears to be the TV reporter
who entered the building with the firemen

11
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,798
in order to cordon off a secure area
of several blocks around the building.

12
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:54,011
We can confirm that the situation
is now under military control.

13
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,806
We're in.

14
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,557
Roger, proceed.

15
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,890
Let's go.

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,307
Guzman, Lucas, third floor.

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,766
Cover me.

18
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:26,599
In here.

19
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:29,766
All set...

20
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:32,475
2nd floor, devices planted...

21
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:34,975
Going up, third floor.

22
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:53,101
Lucas. Lucas. Shit!

23
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:57,643
- Lucas. What the fuck were you doing?
- Done.

24
00:01:58,436 --> 00:02:00,810
- Devices planted.
- Roger!

25
00:02:01,227 --> 00:02:02,268
Let's go.

26
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:05,685
- What's that?
- Shit, shit, shit.

27
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:08,852
Proceeding to activate detonation.
You have four minutes to evacuate.

28
00:02:08,936 --> 00:02:09,977
Go, go, go!

29
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:17,686
Come on, let's go. Let's get out of here.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

31
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:29,853
Are you okay? Can you breathe?

32
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:31,436
Let's get out of here.

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,519
Now!

34
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:36,686
Shit!

35
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:41,478
I don't have a shot!

36
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,312
Shoot! Shoot!

37
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,979
Shit!

38
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:13,479
You're a doctor,

39
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:16,646
you can help me.

40
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:25,188
Evacuate. Three minutes remaining.

41
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:28,647
The rules.

42
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:41,314
Do it. Do it. Do it!

43
00:03:43,815 --> 00:03:45,856
Come on, we have to get out of here.

44
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:50,648
Help me! I'm up here!

45
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:52,857
It's her. We can't leave her here.

46
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,232
No, no, don't even think about it.
There's no time!

47
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:58,857
- Get out of here! I'll handle it.
- You're crazy.

48
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:03,732
Fuck!

49
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:32,316
Okay, okay, it's okay.

50
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,734
You have to trust me, okay?

51
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:40,859
One minute until detonation.

52
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:44,317
Look at me. Look at me!
We're going to get out of here.

53
00:04:53,402 --> 00:04:59,151
APOCALYPSE

54
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,318
Hello, Angela.

55
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:24,485
It's okay,

56
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,111
they're to stop you from hurting yourself.

57
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:37,986
That's it.

58
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:45,319
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

59
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:47,987
No.

60
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:51,195
Stay still.

61
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:53,987
No. No.

62
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:00,446
It's all right.

63
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:09,113
Where am I?

64
00:06:09,989 --> 00:06:12,654
We just want to make sure you're okay.

65
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:15,988
Let her rest.

66
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:36,159
Pardon me.
Could you tell me where the wedding is?

67
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:40,742
I think I must have drunk too much.

68
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:44,534
My daughter-in-law sent me for a lie-down,

69
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:47,159
and I think I've overslept.

70
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:49,826
Sorry, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

71
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:54,826
I don't know where I am. It must be my head.

72
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:59,743
Okay, neither do I know where we are.

73
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:02,076
Then we're in a bit of a fix.

74
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:04,617
Have you seen anyone else around here?

75
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,744
Okay, how about this?
I'll go and try to find out where we are.

76
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:15,660
You stay here. Stay calm and wait.
Someone will come and get you soon.

77
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:20,326
Okay, but if you see my daughter-in-law,
tell her I'm here.

78
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:23,785
- Don't let them forget me.
- Yes, yes, I'll tell her.

79
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:43,327
How is she?

80
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:46,494
She's awake. She seems calm.

81
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:52,036
We're wasting our time.

82
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:54,162
This is the third test
and all have come out negative.

83
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,078
The girl's fine. There are no signs...

84
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:58,495
She was exposed for over six hours in there.

85
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,996
We have to make sure.

86
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:19,955
They really hurt.

87
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:25,329
Okay. I'll loosen them a bit.

88
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:45,956
Stop!

89
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:55,248
We've got a problem in the infirmary.

90
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:56,664
The girl's gotten out.

91
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,081
Get her. Use your weapons if necessary.

92
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,874
How much longer?
It's processing, two minutes.

93
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,666
- I've got her, she's heading upstairs.
- Hold it!

94
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:29,083
Come on!

95
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,458
She's heading for the dining room corridor.

96
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,584
Stop! Don't move!

97
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:46,375
Run.

98
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,500
Go, go, go!

99
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:50,125
Go, go.

100
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:54,500
Stop!

101
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:57,542
- You!
- Out of the way!

102
00:10:57,626 --> 00:11:00,168
We've got her. I said move!
Can't you hear me?

103
00:11:00,335 --> 00:11:02,543
- Help me!
- I said move!

104
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:07,585
- After them!
- Hold it!

105
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,168
Shit.

106
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:10,752
Come on, come on!

107
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:13,835
Let's go, move it!

108
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:21,002
Stop! Hands up! Don't move!

109
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:23,626
Stay there! Don't move!

110
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:29,043
- We've got her. Awaiting orders.
- What is this? Where the hell are we?

111
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,919
Lower your weapons.
We have the test results. She's clean.

112
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:36,210
- Who are you?
- Take her to her cabin.

113
00:11:38,004 --> 00:11:40,003
- You should get some rest.
- No!

114
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:44,336
It's okay, no more restraints, I promise.

115
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,962
I asked you who you were.

116
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:59,295
Please accept my apologies.
I'm Dr Ricarte, the medical protocol...

117
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:01,545
I want to speak to my superiors.

118
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:12,171
- Your superiors sent you here, I'm afraid.
- And my partner?

119
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,171
I assume you're referring to Corporal Lucas.
We had to carry out some extra tests.

120
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:18,421
Just routine.

121
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,088
You'll be able to see him soon.

122
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,796
Why? What the hell are we doing here?
This wasn't part of the operation.

123
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:27,380
It's the only way to ensure total isolation
and you know it.

124
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:29,838
Isolation from what? We're clean, aren't we?

125
00:12:29,922 --> 00:12:31,255
You've obviously already checked.

126
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:35,046
The situation is more complicated
than you think.

127
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,088
There was another outbreak
close to Barcelona.

128
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:40,756
Luckily, we have it under control,

129
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,756
but we can't make any more mistakes.

130
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:46,922
Don't tell me, a wedding.

131
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:51,256
Only one survivor,
but I see you've already met.

132
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,506
Well! New passengers. How wonderful!

133
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:58,173
And now if you'll excuse me,

134
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:02,965
I'm sure Captain Ortega would be delighted
to show you his boat.

135
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:05,048
Captain.

136
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,423
I imagine you boarded with that group
at the last minute?

137
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:13,673
- So it would seem. I'm Guzman.
- Come, I'll show you around.

138
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:34,258
So you're in charge here?

139
00:13:34,342 --> 00:13:36,674
Don't be fooled. The ones in charge
are the ones with the money.

140
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:40,717
And those doctors are paying me
enough to retire on.

141
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:43,842
Forty years at sea are a lot.

142
00:13:44,217 --> 00:13:47,633
So after this, I'm going home.

143
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,092
So the doctors are in control.

144
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:54,176
And just so we don't forget,
they've brought their own little army.

145
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:56,759
I believe you've already had the pleasure.

146
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:09,093
How are we doing?

147
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:12,843
28 knots.
North-easterly wind coming in stronger.

148
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:15,760
In a few hours
we'll be entering a low pressure area.

149
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:17,010
Very good.

150
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:20,093
Reduce speed to a minimum,
with any luck it'll pass us by.

151
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:22,635
Sure. We're not in any rush.

152
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,385
Gorostiaga is our bridge officer.
From Bilbao.

153
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:29,927
- A good man!
- "Pilot," it's easier. And call me Goro.

154
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:32,719
- That bruise doesn't look good.
- This?

155
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:36,178
Tell the imperial soldiers out there,
this is their work.

156
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:37,510
- Have you put something on it?
- No.

157
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:39,677
I think you should put
some antiseptic on there.

158
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:44,344
Listen to the man, he's a doctor.
Specialises in viruses and things like that.

159
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:47,178
Here we go again.

160
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,887
I'm afraid this boat's too old
to throw such a party.

161
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:54,095
No. Not too old.

162
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:55,970
The problem is that
they're overloading the generator

163
00:14:56,054 --> 00:14:58,887
with all that medical equipment
they've got in the hold.

164
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:01,678
- What happened?
- Power cuts.

165
00:15:01,763 --> 00:15:03,678
It's been happening since we set sail.

166
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:06,845
It's worse at night.
Sometimes it goes down for a long time.

167
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:09,721
They're setting up
some kind of lab down there.

168
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:14,387
- What medical equipment?
- Like I said, it's none of our business.

169
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:29,138
Pardon me.

170
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:34,930
I don't mean to trouble you.
But, have we met?

171
00:15:35,431 --> 00:15:36,472
No.

172
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:40,097
With so many people I get confused.

173
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:46,222
Are you on my grandson's side
or the bride's?

174
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:54,014
Did you have a bit too much to drink?

175
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:58,264
Don't worry dear, me too!

176
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:26,141
Nic. Nic!

177
00:16:27,558 --> 00:16:29,974
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

178
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:34,057
Nic is the radio operator,
despite his appearance.

179
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,974
Yeah, though there's not much for me to do.

180
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,224
Those assholes coded the frequency
as soon as they got here, so...

181
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:44,349
You're saying we're cut ofF?

182
00:16:44,893 --> 00:16:47,850
So much so
that we don't even have lifeboats.

183
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,558
I guess they hadn't told you that.

184
00:16:50,768 --> 00:16:51,850
They're inoperative.

185
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:54,184
They blocked the offloading mechanism
before we set sail.

186
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:55,642
Those were their conditions.

187
00:16:56,185 --> 00:17:00,184
Yeah, what was it?
Security... Security protocol.

188
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:01,684
Pure bullshit.

189
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:03,809
How are you getting on with the camera?

190
00:17:04,518 --> 00:17:06,350
I'm working on it,
but it's going to take time.

191
00:17:07,102 --> 00:17:10,893
The camera still works,
but the hard drive's pretty busted,

192
00:17:10,977 --> 00:17:13,642
so I'm going to have to do it
frame by frame.

193
00:17:13,977 --> 00:17:15,310
A pain in the ass!

194
00:17:15,394 --> 00:17:19,351
Nic is also our IT man.

195
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:22,268
The doctors asked him to recover
the recording from the camera.

196
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:24,393
They seem very interested in it.

197
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:28,351
I found it next to the girl.
God knows what's on it.

198
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:29,810
No way...

199
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:32,602
So you're the guy who saved Angela Vidal?

200
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:34,643
Something like that.

201
00:17:34,978 --> 00:17:36,394
You don't know how happy you've made him!

202
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:39,269
I'm such a huge fan of that chick.

203
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:41,728
When I'm on land, I never miss her show.

204
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,644
And when you're not, she comes to visit,
isn't that nice?

205
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,811
Let's see.

206
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:52,561
So if you saved her,
you must know her pretty well, right?

207
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:54,519
Well, more or less.

208
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:58,103
I mean, maybe you could introduce me?

209
00:17:59,188 --> 00:18:00,728
Sure. Of course.

210
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,896
Check this out. We've got a Filipino DJ.

211
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:08,437
They come cheap apparently!

212
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,854
The chef. That's the dinner bell,
you'll get used to it.

213
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:29,688
- Depths ofthe sea, how can I help?
- How's it going down there?

214
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:32,646
Worse and worse.
I don't even know where to start.

215
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:35,605
You'd better tell them
to keep calm up there.

216
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:37,855
Calm is not an option, I assure you!

217
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:40,480
Come up and get some dinner.
You can carry on later.

218
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:43,522
Okay, whatever you say.

219
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:51,397
Here.

220
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:55,106
It's all there is!

221
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,564
I don't usually eat much dinner.

222
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:05,315
A glass of warm milk is more than enough.

223
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:09,064
Right. Hey, you!

224
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,023
Could you bring this lady a glass of milk?

225
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,899
Milk?

226
00:19:13,982 --> 00:19:16,231
And some cookies, if you have any.

227
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:18,607
While you're there, see if there's
anything else to eat.

228
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,774
Some meat, or sauce even.

229
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:27,065
This isn't an all-inclusive cruise!
Don't forget it.

230
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:31,441
Take it easy.

231
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:35,441
- Where the hell were you?
- And you?

232
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:37,858
Yeah.

233
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:42,608
- Have you spoken to my daughter-in-law?
- No.

234
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:50,733
I know it's one of those modern weddings,
but this is too much.

235
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,567
- Milk and cookies.
- Wonderful! Thank you dear!

236
00:19:57,818 --> 00:20:00,066
Ma'am. There's sugar over there.

237
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:04,026
Really? I'll go and get some.
A little bit won't hurt.

238
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,610
She's completely disoriented.
She's got no clue where she is.

239
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:16,443
Somebody should talk to her.

240
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,067
Yeah? And tell her what?
That her whole family's dead?

241
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:27,194
I've just seen the ship's captain.

242
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,943
They made him immobilise the lifeboats.

243
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,943
And cut all radio communication.

244
00:20:32,944 --> 00:20:34,027
What?

245
00:20:34,153 --> 00:20:37,486
That's what I heard.
And they've set up a lab in the hold.

246
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,360
This was supposed to be
a precautionary quarantine, right?

247
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,235
- What kind of lab?
- They're hiding something.

248
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:47,611
Otherwise why so much security?

249
00:20:48,862 --> 00:20:50,861
Haven't you seen the cameras?

250
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:52,944
They're all over the boat.

251
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:55,278
You can't even take a piss
without them watching you.

252
00:20:57,779 --> 00:20:59,528
They're pissing me off.

253
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,945
Maybe it's not such a bad thing.

254
00:21:14,696 --> 00:21:18,820
So, looks like you got it working. Good job.

255
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,945
You know you could work
for naval intelligence. Maybe I could...

256
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,613
- Seriously?
- Well, you never know.

257
00:21:26,864 --> 00:21:29,196
Wow! Naval intelligence!

258
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,279
Listen, I was wondering...

259
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:35,113
Do you think you could access
the security cameras from here?

260
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:37,780
Who do you take me for?

261
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:39,530
Well, it's just that before,
I saw you looking.

262
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:43,280
That was the first thing I did!
I keep myself entertained!

263
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:45,489
How do you think I knew she was here?

264
00:21:46,531 --> 00:21:47,156
Unbelievable!

265
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:49,614
Don't forget to
introduce me. You promised!

266
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:51,113
Yeah, yeah, of course.

267
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:54,031
And the lab?

268
00:21:58,115 --> 00:22:00,364
The door's locked and security coded.

269
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:02,615
Seems they don't want us
sticking our noses in.

270
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:06,989
They've done a good job down there,
but they didn't count on Nic.

271
00:22:09,032 --> 00:22:10,698
Go, Nic! There you have it.

272
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:15,239
Any idea what they're up to in there?

273
00:22:15,324 --> 00:22:19,698
No idea, but I saw them
taking a load of cages in there.

274
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,282
- God knows what they need cages for.
- Cages.

275
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:29,699
And that door? You know what's behind it?

276
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:33,115
No idea, there are no cameras in there.
But look.

277
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:37,240
This is the maximum zoom we can get.

278
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:45,200
-200%. Not bad, eh?
- No, not bad at all.

279
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:51,700
- Can you do that with all the cameras?
- Which one do you want?

280
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:09,495
No, not now. Here we go again.

281
00:25:17,874 --> 00:25:19,081
What the hell is going on?

282
00:25:19,874 --> 00:25:22,332
I don't know what the fuck you do
down here all day,

283
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:25,540
but that should be fixed by now.
The whole system's down.

284
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,540
Really? I hadn't noticed.

285
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,248
Is he fucking with us?

286
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,999
Maybe where you come from,
people don't know much about hard work,

287
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,791
but here we do things differently.

288
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,791
So fucking sort it out!

289
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:50,249
I'm from Spain and here things are done
however I fucking feel like it!

290
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:52,750
You heard what I said.

291
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:54,625
Hurry up and sort it!

292
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,876
No, no, it's all right, it's me.

293
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What are you doing here?
I got scared.

294
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:22,210
Everything's okay. I'm with you, okay?

295
00:26:23,543 --> 00:26:25,460
- Let's go back to the cabins.
- Wait!

296
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,793
Don't tell them, please.

297
00:26:31,294 --> 00:26:35,043
Listen to me, nobody's going to hurt you.
Nobody.

298
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,168
Let's go.

299
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:29,832
This is going to be a force eight,
I bet you.

300
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:32,129
And it's coming straight for us.

301
00:27:32,547 --> 00:27:34,213
- Looks like it.
- Shit.

302
00:27:34,631 --> 00:27:36,921
It's going to be here before expected.

303
00:27:38,464 --> 00:27:41,755
What did you expect? It's my last voyage...

304
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:44,505
I couldn't go out without a bang!

305
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:46,379
I don't like the look of it.

306
00:27:46,923 --> 00:27:49,380
- Excuse me.
- Morning.

307
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:52,880
- Morning.
- This is Angela.

308
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:54,713
- Hello.
- Hello.

309
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:59,214
- We've heard a lot about you!
- That over there is Goro.

310
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:02,964
And over there is your number one fan.
Or so they tell me.

311
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,339
Indeed he is.

312
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,589
Well, sometimes I watch your show.
I'm Nic.

313
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:11,089
- Hi.
- Hi.

314
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:13,131
Nic's downloading the images
from your camera.

315
00:28:13,216 --> 00:28:15,714
Well, trying to.

316
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:21,131
My camera? It's here?

317
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:31,757
Do you normally watch them later?
I mean on TV?

318
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:33,757
- No.
- No, of course not.

319
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:38,632
My favourite was the one
with the garbage men, it was so funny!

320
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,257
When you jumped

321
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:42,716
in that container,

322
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:44,299
the guy couldn't believe his eyes!

323
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:45,674
Brilliant TV!

324
00:28:51,383 --> 00:28:53,091
- Want one?
- No.

325
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:06,966
Sorry to ask, but you wouldn't mind,
would you?

326
00:29:07,176 --> 00:29:08,175
What?

327
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:11,467
If you could do that "Hi, I'm Angela Vidal.
Welcome to..." thing,

328
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:13,383
but personalised for me.

329
00:29:14,177 --> 00:29:16,218
I know it's stupid but it'd make my day!

330
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:20,259
No, leave it, maybe later.

331
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:24,176
You must be sick of people
asking you to do it, I understand.

332
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:27,176
- Damn it!
- Sorry.

333
00:29:27,344 --> 00:29:29,510
What a klutz. No, it was me. It's okay.

334
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:35,052
It's waterproof,
or at least it's supposed to be.

335
00:29:35,594 --> 00:29:36,843
In case we sink!

336
00:29:44,677 --> 00:29:48,052
- Have you seen it?
- I saw some of the images.

337
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:53,219
I don't know what it's all about,
but I'm glad I wasn't there.

338
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,761
That's it!

339
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,719
Done!

340
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:08,053
Now I just have to put them in order.

341
00:30:08,346 --> 00:30:11,386
Twenty-five frames per second,
it'll take a little while.

342
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:16,720
- How long?
- Not long, an hour or so.

343
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:18,720
Maybe less.

344
00:30:18,805 --> 00:30:21,428
Sure you don't want one? It tastes good.

345
00:30:35,472 --> 00:30:36,554
Let's go.

346
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,263
It's gone! The host is gone!

347
00:30:44,972 --> 00:30:46,971
What the hell are you talking about?

348
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:49,055
- Raise the alarm!
- No!

349
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,263
We need to stay in control.

350
00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:54,013
Close everything down.

351
00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:30,723
The restraints aren't broken.
Someone let it out.

352
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:32,307
That's impossible.

353
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,349
They couldn't have got round
the security system.

354
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:37,265
- We'd have seen them.
- Not if it was during the blackout.

355
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:39,265
What about the security code?

356
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:43,682
- How many people know the code.
- Very few.

357
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:45,974
Who would do such a thing?
It makes no sense.

358
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:49,891
Come with me.
Get the Taser and the retroviral.

359
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:53,682
- What are you going to do?
- Find it before it attacks someone.

360
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:56,600
We'd better hope this works.

361
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:41,896
- Hey! What's up with the food?
- What do you mean?

362
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:46,063
That Filipino's fucking about. We've been
here 10 minutes and still no food.

363
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:52,271
Edwin?

364
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:59,647
What the hell? Have you seen this mess?

365
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:08,564
At least it looks like
you made an effort today.

366
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,689
Are you high or what?

367
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:17,898
The dining room's full
and they're starting to get hungry,

368
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:20,648
so you'd better get moving.

369
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,106
I'll take this to the dining room,

370
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:25,981
but get a move on or
the shit will hit the fan.

371
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,649
Yes! Nice one!

372
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,398
Go, Nic!

373
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:59,483
Lamb! Now we're talking, gentlemen!

374
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:01,983
I hope you've left some for us.

375
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:05,650
Second shift starts in 20 minutes.
If you hurry, you'll miss the jarheads!

376
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:06,900
What?

377
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,067
How are you feeling today?

378
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,900
They think I don't know what's going on.

379
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,192
They've put me in a home

380
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,734
without even telling me.

381
00:35:27,735 --> 00:35:29,901
Are you feeling hungrier today?

382
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:33,109
No, it's not a question of hunger,

383
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:35,776
it's a question of my stomach.

384
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:38,693
Could you talk to the waiter?

385
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:43,777
See if he could make me some pasta,
or an omelette?

386
00:35:44,361 --> 00:35:47,235
I'll go see. But I can't promise anything!

387
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:54,944
Hello? Hello?

388
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:19,570
Hi, sorry, I was wondering
if there was anything else?

389
00:36:19,737 --> 00:36:22,403
The old lady's got a delicate stomach.

390
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:24,779
Something grilled would be good or...

391
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

392
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:43,737
Shit!

393
00:36:49,781 --> 00:36:52,071
Come on, just have a taste and then decide.

394
00:36:55,823 --> 00:36:58,863
It doesn't smell half bad.
Credit where credit's due.

395
00:36:59,073 --> 00:37:03,405
- No! No! Don't eat it!
- What's wrong?

396
00:37:03,572 --> 00:37:06,405
The chef's like the people in the building!
He tried to bite me!

397
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,905
Lucas, did he?

398
00:37:09,156 --> 00:37:10,864
No. No.

399
00:37:10,948 --> 00:37:12,781
- Has anyone eaten anything?
- No.

400
00:37:13,615 --> 00:37:14,739
Okay, stay here.

401
00:37:15,573 --> 00:37:17,114
- Wait! Wait!
- Stay with her!

402
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:21,240
Don't move!

403
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:24,240
- What happened?
- You tell us.

404
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:26,532
This was supposed to be
a precautionary quarantine.

405
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,073
Tell me what happened.

406
00:37:28,324 --> 00:37:30,864
The chef tried to bite me,
that's what happened.

407
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:32,448
Do you know what this means?

408
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:35,323
Where is he?

409
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,740
In the kitchen.
I managed to shut him in the refrigerator.

410
00:37:41,908 --> 00:37:44,573
Okay. Come with us.

411
00:37:44,991 --> 00:37:46,241
Just you.

412
00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:52,241
It's here already.

413
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:56,574
This is going to be a hell of a party.

414
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,825
- Are you okay?
- I don't know. I don't feel well.

415
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:07,408
- Must have been something I ate.
- I'm not surprised.

416
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:11,158
- Probably that worm you get from raw fish.
- Anisakis.

417
00:38:11,243 --> 00:38:14,784
- What?
- The worm's called Anisakis.

418
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:19,575
- Whatever you call it.
- But we didn't have fish today.

419
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,076
You should go and lie down.
I'll take care of everything.

420
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,909
A retroviral. That's what we've been doing.

421
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,701
We've managed to control two outbreaks
in 24 hours,

422
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:44,910
but we might not be so lucky next time.

423
00:38:45,078 --> 00:38:47,868
How did you do it?
We don't know anything about the virus.

424
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:52,327
We know more than you think.
We have a sample.

425
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:57,160
We injected it into a healthy host
and waited for the symptoms to appear.

426
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,160
Hang on. A sample?
Where did you get it from?

427
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:03,369
That's not important. What's important
is that someone let the host out,

428
00:39:03,453 --> 00:39:05,994
and now we're in big trouble.

429
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,410
- Fucking awesome!
- Give him the Taser.

430
00:39:08,787 --> 00:39:10,577
There's no more time to lose.

431
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:13,619
- What are you going to do?
- Test the retroviral.

432
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:19,453
As soon as I open the door, shoot.
The shot will paralyse him,

433
00:39:20,037 --> 00:39:22,161
- but only for a few seconds.
- Okay.

434
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:25,245
Ready? Now!

435
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:36,829
Out of my way!

436
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:55,372
Come on! Get out!

437
00:40:07,373 --> 00:40:09,664
What the hell happened?

438
00:40:09,748 --> 00:40:12,163
The virus is feeding, getting stronger.

439
00:40:12,248 --> 00:40:16,455
- Shit! That's not possible!
- Obviously it is!

440
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,122
It should have worked.
We followed all the steps.

441
00:40:21,249 --> 00:40:22,831
You've obviously lost control.

442
00:40:22,915 --> 00:40:25,623
So call whoever you need to
and get us the hell out of here!

443
00:40:25,749 --> 00:40:29,915
- He's right. Tell them to come and get us.
- You know the rules.

444
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:33,164
Nobody's coming to get us.

445
00:40:34,707 --> 00:40:35,915
Not now.

446
00:41:06,084 --> 00:41:07,375
Let's get back to the lab.

447
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:08,749
We have to find out what went wrong.

448
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,792
Hey! Wait a minute! And what about us?

449
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:13,875
We don't know if the food is infected.

450
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:15,500
We can't take any risks.

451
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:17,250
No, no, no. No one's eaten anything.

452
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:21,375
- It's true. I got here in time. I swear.
- Then there's no need to worry.

453
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:25,583
- No need to worry? We're the second shift!
- You can't leave us here.

454
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:29,834
As I said, we can't take any risks.
Let's go.

455
00:41:29,918 --> 00:41:31,834
Wait, wait!

456
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:37,459
I brought you what you asked for.
You can't do this to us.

457
00:41:37,627 --> 00:41:40,751
- What the fuck is he talking about?
- I'm sorry.

458
00:41:42,086 --> 00:41:47,668
- Let's go. There's no time to lose.
- Lucas? What have you done?

459
00:41:49,086 --> 00:41:51,043
I took a blood sample from the building.

460
00:41:51,253 --> 00:41:53,168
They told me I had to, for all our sakes.

461
00:41:53,253 --> 00:41:54,710
You took infected blood?

462
00:41:54,795 --> 00:41:57,669
Just a small sample. They said they
needed it before blowing up the building.

463
00:41:57,753 --> 00:41:58,752
Who?

464
00:41:59,837 --> 00:42:01,418
It's not just a simple virus.

465
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,086
Some priests came to see me. I saw photos.

466
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:06,502
Things you can't even imagine!
That shit's not what you think.

467
00:42:06,753 --> 00:42:09,919
- What else?
- They know what they're doing.

468
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:15,086
- They're financing this whole thing.
- Son of a bitch! And now what?

469
00:42:15,254 --> 00:42:16,253
Okay.

470
00:42:16,587 --> 00:42:19,545
I don't know what's going on here,
but where are your manners?

471
00:42:19,629 --> 00:42:21,753
You don't know what's going on here.

472
00:42:23,088 --> 00:42:28,878
Well maybe it's about time you knew
your whole family's dead!

473
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,128
Dead!

474
00:42:30,255 --> 00:42:31,753
- Leave her alone!
- Enough!

475
00:42:35,171 --> 00:42:36,671
I don't care what that shit is,

476
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:40,254
but if the food is infected,
we're really screwed.

477
00:42:43,213 --> 00:42:45,128
Okay, we'll go up to the bridge
and stay there.

478
00:42:45,213 --> 00:42:46,462
Captain Ortega will help us.

479
00:42:46,547 --> 00:42:50,587
Really? And how? We're unarmed!

480
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:57,255
Grab anything that we can use. Hurry!

481
00:43:30,924 --> 00:43:33,339
- Here.
- That's not going to help us.

482
00:43:33,423 --> 00:43:35,131
Well, it's all we've got. Let's go!

483
00:43:35,382 --> 00:43:36,631
Let's go! Let's go!

484
00:43:37,424 --> 00:43:38,548
Let's go!

485
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,590
I don't mean to be rude,

486
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:03,258
but I think I'm going to go and lie down.

487
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:11,633
- Get back, get back.
- Go, go, go!

488
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:17,217
Get back, get back!

489
00:44:24,343 --> 00:44:25,634
Get off me!

490
00:44:33,552 --> 00:44:34,759
Get back!

491
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:57,760
- Come on. We have to reach the bridge.
- Go, go, go!

492
00:44:58,594 --> 00:45:00,760
They're all over the ship.
It's like a fucking plague.

493
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,219
- Where's Goro?
- I don't know. He wasn't feeling well.

494
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:05,718
- I told him to go and rest.
- Shit!

495
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,844
- Depths of the sea, yes?
- Everything okay down there?

496
00:45:09,262 --> 00:45:11,553
I haven't even stopped to eat,
if you call that okay.

497
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:14,312
Good, stay there.
Don't move until I tell you.

498
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:15,761
What's going on?

499
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:17,094
Do as I say.

500
00:45:20,178 --> 00:45:21,594
Lock the door.

501
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:48,054
- Come on, this way.
- Are you sure?

502
00:45:48,138 --> 00:45:49,720
Yes, move it!

503
00:45:49,805 --> 00:45:53,263
Could you ask my children to come
and get me?

504
00:45:54,264 --> 00:45:58,429
- We're almost there. Just a few meters.
- Tell them I won't be any trouble.

505
00:45:58,597 --> 00:45:59,721
Let's go!

506
00:46:17,473 --> 00:46:18,764
Now what?

507
00:46:18,848 --> 00:46:21,430
Have you got nothing better to do
than piss me ofF?

508
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:24,764
Hey! What are you doing?

509
00:46:57,141 --> 00:46:58,932
Help me!

510
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:01,849
I can't.

511
00:47:02,267 --> 00:47:03,890
- Shoot it!
- I can't! I can't!

512
00:47:04,058 --> 00:47:05,266
Get it off me!

513
00:47:06,517 --> 00:47:08,099
What's that?

514
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:12,766
Let it go! Let it go!

515
00:47:18,226 --> 00:47:19,517
What the hell's that?

516
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:23,100
Machine room, loss of oil pressure.

517
00:47:23,393 --> 00:47:24,433
Just what we needed!

518
00:47:54,561 --> 00:47:56,518
Get out! Let go!

519
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,352
Shit!

520
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:03,269
What was that?

521
00:48:04,311 --> 00:48:06,310
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

522
00:48:09,936 --> 00:48:11,018
Where is she?

523
00:48:12,687 --> 00:48:15,435
- She's gone.
- Fuck me!

524
00:48:15,728 --> 00:48:16,727
What are we going to do?

525
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,936
You go up to the bridge.
I'll look for her.

526
00:48:20,145 --> 00:48:22,228
Hey! Where the fuck are you going?

527
00:48:22,396 --> 00:48:25,727
You're unarmed, she's got no chance.
It's suicide.

528
00:48:25,812 --> 00:48:27,936
We can't leave her. Someone has to go.

529
00:48:31,979 --> 00:48:33,728
I fucked up.

530
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:37,478
I owe you.

531
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:46,312
Let's go.

532
00:49:06,273 --> 00:49:09,230
It's us! Open up!

533
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:12,480
- Wait!
- It's us! Open the door!

534
00:49:12,772 --> 00:49:15,564
- We don't know if they're infected.
- Open up! Open the door!

535
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:16,772
Nic!

536
00:49:20,356 --> 00:49:23,313
Come on! Close it! Close it now!

537
00:49:25,274 --> 00:49:28,564
What the hell's going on out there?
The quacks have fucked us over, right?

538
00:49:28,648 --> 00:49:31,814
The situation's changed.
From now on, you're back in charge.

539
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:35,856
- We're going home.
- I wish I could. The engine's leaking oil.

540
00:49:36,482 --> 00:49:37,981
If it overheats, it could catch fire.

541
00:49:38,232 --> 00:49:40,231
- I have to turn it off.
- No!

542
00:49:40,357 --> 00:49:42,648
- Calm down!
- You don't know what that thing is!

543
00:49:42,732 --> 00:49:43,940
Wait!

544
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,940
- We could try the backup engine.
- Start it up.

545
00:49:48,024 --> 00:49:50,439
I can't from here.
It can only be started from the engine room.

546
00:49:50,566 --> 00:49:52,065
Shit! Shit!

547
00:49:53,275 --> 00:49:57,107
What the fuck is this?
You were in the building, you should know!

548
00:49:57,191 --> 00:50:00,315
I don't know anything, but those doctors do.

549
00:50:00,608 --> 00:50:03,607
If we're going to stand any chance,
we need to know what they know.

550
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:05,858
Oh, sure! How shall we do that?

551
00:50:05,942 --> 00:50:08,024
Are you going to go out there
and take a survey?

552
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:14,649
Their computers.
Do you think you can access them?

553
00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:24,608
They put me online to send them
the camera images.

554
00:50:24,776 --> 00:50:26,108
They've handed it to us on a plate.

555
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:31,067
Okay, it's what I thought.
The system's encrypted and reinforced.

556
00:50:31,277 --> 00:50:33,192
- What's that?
- Nothing serious. I hope.

557
00:50:35,568 --> 00:50:39,984
I don't understand, everything's in order.
It should have worked.

558
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,776
Maybe the virus mutates
according to the host's DNA.

559
00:50:45,819 --> 00:50:48,067
That would make each strain different.

560
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:53,734
We need the original strain,
free of mutations.

561
00:50:54,944 --> 00:51:00,151
The girl. And obviously, we don't have her.

562
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:05,569
Gentlemen, it's game over.

563
00:51:05,861 --> 00:51:10,360
No, wait. There must be another way.

564
00:51:10,444 --> 00:51:14,111
I'm very sorry. You know the protocol.

565
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:24,570
- No!
- Twenty minutes. Make the most of them.

566
00:51:24,654 --> 00:51:28,069
No, listen!
We could try to modify the DES1 enzyme,

567
00:51:28,195 --> 00:51:30,111
then the membranes will become more rigid

568
00:51:30,195 --> 00:51:31,862
and we could delay the virus
reaching the DNA.

569
00:51:31,946 --> 00:51:34,862
That will just slow down the process.
It won't help.

570
00:51:35,404 --> 00:51:38,862
Not without the original strain. I'm sorry.

571
00:51:39,113 --> 00:51:42,237
Please. You can't.

572
00:51:42,446 --> 00:51:46,112
There was no room for error.
You know the rules.

573
00:51:46,988 --> 00:51:49,779
Wait! The boy's done it!

574
00:51:50,946 --> 00:51:52,946
We've got the camera images.

575
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:58,071
Go, Nic! All yours.

576
00:52:02,114 --> 00:52:04,779
How can I find the oldest files?

577
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,196
Let's see. Here.

578
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,280
What is all this?

579
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:15,697
- What the fuck?
- Wait, wait.

580
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:18,822
I saw that name in the building.

581
00:52:21,115 --> 00:52:22,281
In the attic.

582
00:52:23,115 --> 00:52:25,447
There were newspaper cuttings
with that name.

583
00:52:29,781 --> 00:52:33,823
It's her! It's the same girl.
The place was full of her photos.

584
00:52:35,115 --> 00:52:37,364
Information about a hospital admission,

585
00:52:38,032 --> 00:52:40,489
ordered by the Diocese of Naples.

586
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:41,906
Priests?

587
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:43,990
Parascientific diagnosis,
what the fuck is this?

588
00:52:44,116 --> 00:52:45,156
Wait.

589
00:52:47,032 --> 00:52:50,240
The cuttings were about the girl
being possessed or something.

590
00:52:51,782 --> 00:52:54,699
About the Church. The Devil.

591
00:52:54,783 --> 00:52:57,907
- Stop fucking around, man!
- It makes sense.

592
00:52:59,032 --> 00:53:01,240
They admitted her to get
medical confirmation.

593
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:03,949
The doctor in charge...

594
00:53:06,075 --> 00:53:08,074
What a surprise.

595
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:21,867
What's that?

596
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:26,616
- It can't be.
- Yes, it can. It's the girl.

597
00:53:29,784 --> 00:53:33,117
- What the hell was she doing there?
- Rewind.

598
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:44,492
What is this? God!

599
00:53:50,368 --> 00:53:54,034
- A parasite.
- The source of the virus.

600
00:53:54,952 --> 00:53:56,951
It was right in front of our noses!

601
00:53:57,286 --> 00:53:59,159
This was the devil they were searching for?

602
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,201
A parasite?

603
00:54:01,327 --> 00:54:05,451
That thing was controlling the girl's body
and mind and used her as a transmitter.

604
00:54:05,953 --> 00:54:08,119
But it kept her immune to protect itself.

605
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,410
Clever.

606
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:13,785
It's been growing inside the girl
all these years.

607
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:16,869
Until it found a better host.

608
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:23,202
The original strain. We've got it!
Get everything ready. Surgical material.

609
00:54:23,495 --> 00:54:27,119
We have to get that thing out of her.
We can still stop this!

610
00:54:34,288 --> 00:54:39,870
Ma'am. Ma'am, come on.
We have to find the others.

611
00:54:40,454 --> 00:54:41,495
You have to trust me.

612
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

613
00:55:06,455 --> 00:55:08,454
No, no, no.

614
00:55:20,581 --> 00:55:22,038
Fuck you!

615
00:55:24,831 --> 00:55:26,122
Don't move!

616
00:55:29,998 --> 00:55:33,163
Drop your weapon and turn around slowly.

617
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,290
Where's the girl?

618
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:46,206
On a cruise!

619
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:52,248
Last chance.

620
00:55:53,124 --> 00:55:55,164
Where is she?

621
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:59,082
What's wrong? No answer?

622
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:01,582
And there's not going to be.

623
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,790
Then we have to go down there
and do it ourselves.

624
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,332
We have to start that engine.

625
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:09,124
Easy.
Except I'm not planning on going out there.

626
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,374
And what do you suggest?

627
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:13,749
We just wait here for those things
to come get us?

628
00:56:13,834 --> 00:56:15,833
Listen, this was my last voyage.

629
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:18,833
And no one wants to go home more than me.

630
00:56:20,166 --> 00:56:21,624
But I want to make it alive.

631
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:24,833
Open up!

632
00:56:25,959 --> 00:56:27,292
- Lucas.
- Open up, please!

633
00:56:32,042 --> 00:56:35,417
- Hey, hey! What are you doing?
- Nobody touch her!

634
00:56:35,501 --> 00:56:37,667
Get away from her. Stand aside!

635
00:56:37,751 --> 00:56:40,208
- What's going on?
- It's a parasite.

636
00:56:40,418 --> 00:56:42,417
It's inside her.
It's the source of the virus.

637
00:56:42,501 --> 00:56:43,542
What?

638
00:56:44,002 --> 00:56:46,209
- What are you talking about?
- We saw it on the video.

639
00:56:46,294 --> 00:56:49,542
How it went inside her.
You can see for yourself...

640
00:56:49,626 --> 00:56:53,418
What are you talking about?
You said she was clean.

641
00:56:53,502 --> 00:56:56,585
She is. That thing keeps its host immune.

642
00:56:56,669 --> 00:57:01,459
That's how it goes unnoticed.
Careful! We need her alive!

643
00:57:01,586 --> 00:57:03,126
Tell them to let her go.

644
00:57:11,627 --> 00:57:14,586
- You're making a mistake.
- Let her go.

645
00:57:16,587 --> 00:57:18,335
That gun's not loaded.

646
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:19,711
But this one is.

647
00:57:21,378 --> 00:57:25,085
Don't you understand?
This parasite's the original strain.

648
00:57:25,169 --> 00:57:27,627
It's the only way to make the retroviral.

649
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:30,211
That's why it didn't work before.
There's no other way.

650
00:57:30,296 --> 00:57:33,586
- I don't care.
- Please be reasonable.

651
00:57:33,837 --> 00:57:36,836
We only have to extract it.
She doesn't need to get hurt.

652
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,044
- No, no, no! They're lying!
- You're a doctor.

653
00:57:40,129 --> 00:57:44,336
You have experience controlling epidemics.
You know this is the only way.

654
00:57:54,462 --> 00:57:56,379
We'll never get her to the lab like this.

655
00:57:56,463 --> 00:57:58,628
On that table. We'll do it there.

656
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:02,546
- Hurry!
- Nic! Nic!

657
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:03,838
Be careful!

658
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,880
- On her back.
- Help me!

659
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,546
Grab her head.

660
00:58:18,047 --> 00:58:20,505
Tie her down. Like that. Good.

661
00:58:21,214 --> 00:58:25,630
- Wait a minute, and if it's a mistake?
- I told you, it's on video.

662
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:28,589
You can see it yourselves.
Time's running out.

663
00:58:28,965 --> 00:58:29,964
Nic!

664
00:58:30,172 --> 00:58:31,171
Hold her down.

665
00:58:32,631 --> 00:58:35,089
- I can't find it.
- We saw it. It has to be there.

666
00:58:35,464 --> 00:58:36,505
Doctor.

667
00:58:53,591 --> 00:58:56,173
Don't move. Push her head back.

668
00:59:06,425 --> 00:59:08,424
- I need towels!
- In the bathroom.

669
00:59:08,508 --> 00:59:09,965
Quickly!

670
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hurry! Hold her down!
What the hell's going on?

671
00:59:38,759 --> 00:59:39,758
Help me!

672
00:59:39,843 --> 00:59:41,842
I don't have a shot!

673
00:59:44,593 --> 00:59:46,633
Shoot! Shoot!

674
00:59:47,135 --> 00:59:48,467
What's going on?

675
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:01,885
Get her!

676
01:00:12,136 --> 01:00:13,843
Don't let her escape!

677
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:49,595
It's superficial. It's nothing.

678
01:00:52,054 --> 01:00:57,429
Wait. The DES1 will work.
You said so yourself.

679
01:00:57,513 --> 01:01:00,679
We can still find the girl
and make the antidote.

680
01:01:00,971 --> 01:01:03,470
You know there's no time.

681
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:08,013
You still need me.

682
01:01:09,388 --> 01:01:10,762
Not any more.

683
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:21,096
- And now what?
- Now we find the girl!

684
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:25,471
No! This is over.
Stop fucking around and call for help.

685
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:28,805
- You're the only one who can use the radio.
- Not without an antidote.

686
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,055
You'll never do it. You're crazy.

687
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,471
Well if I don't,

688
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:37,055
I can assure you that very soon
there'll be nowhere to go back to.

689
01:01:38,806 --> 01:01:40,639
Let's go! We're wasting time.

690
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:46,639
Walkie-talkies on frequency 9.
She can't have gone far.

691
01:02:19,309 --> 01:02:20,932
Shit!

692
01:02:24,392 --> 01:02:27,474
Okay, fuck this. Can you pilot the ship?

693
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:33,391
I can try, I've helped a couple of times,
but I don't know.

694
01:02:39,767 --> 01:02:43,100
Okay, we'll go down and get the backup
engine started. Do you know how?

695
01:02:43,184 --> 01:02:46,975
I think so.
But I can't go down there, I'm sorry.

696
01:02:47,685 --> 01:02:50,767
He's right, all we have is four kitchen
knives, which won't take us very far.

697
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,225
- Are you fucking kidding?
- Any better ideas?

698
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:57,559
Wait, there's some fishing material
stored on the stern deck.

699
01:02:57,643 --> 01:02:59,475
Fucking great! Now we're going fishing!

700
01:02:59,768 --> 01:03:02,601
Okay, you stay here.
We'll go and grab whatever we find.

701
01:03:03,144 --> 01:03:06,101
We'll come back
and then all go down to the engine room.

702
01:03:06,603 --> 01:03:10,976
Lock the door. We need you alive,
you're the only one who can pilot this ship.

703
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:20,810
Stern, this way.

704
01:03:22,644 --> 01:03:25,643
This is a fucking maze. We'll never find it!

705
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:30,477
Over there!

706
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:47,061
Got her! She's in the cabin corridor.

707
01:03:47,146 --> 01:03:49,644
- Where?
- Cabin corridor.

708
01:03:49,854 --> 01:03:51,353
Let's go! Let's go!

709
01:04:06,897 --> 01:04:09,396
No! Shit! She's smashing the cameras!

710
01:04:09,605 --> 01:04:10,896
We've lost her.

711
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:21,062
Where is she?

712
01:04:25,814 --> 01:04:26,980
Shit!

713
01:04:52,316 --> 01:04:55,064
Got her! Dining room corridor.

714
01:04:55,149 --> 01:04:57,148
Go, go, go!

715
01:05:10,858 --> 01:05:12,149
Quickly! Hurry!

716
01:05:16,442 --> 01:05:18,899
Angela, no! Here!

717
01:05:19,275 --> 01:05:20,274
It's Nic.

718
01:05:21,233 --> 01:05:23,065
The walkie-talkie,
pick up the walkie-talkie.

719
01:05:23,983 --> 01:05:29,399
Pick it up!
Come on, come on, pick it up. Do it!

720
01:05:29,609 --> 01:05:32,399
Okay! Now, dial 7.

721
01:05:32,483 --> 01:05:33,983
Dial 7, come on!

722
01:05:34,317 --> 01:05:36,566
Dial 7, dial 7!

723
01:05:37,318 --> 01:05:38,358
Nic?

724
01:05:38,443 --> 01:05:40,774
Good. We're alone now.

725
01:05:41,151 --> 01:05:42,150
I can see you.

726
01:05:42,234 --> 01:05:44,108
But I can't help you
if you smash the cameras.

727
01:05:44,484 --> 01:05:46,692
- Okay.
- Now get the hell out of there.

728
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,233
They're coming for you.

729
01:05:48,818 --> 01:05:50,066
What the fuck are you doing?

730
01:05:50,234 --> 01:05:52,567
You have to get out of there!
They're right behind you!

731
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:58,901
What are you doing?
They'll be there any minute!

732
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,318
Angela, listen to me.

733
01:06:02,485 --> 01:06:04,109
You have to get out of there right now.

734
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:05,276
Go!

735
01:06:13,444 --> 01:06:14,818
Why did you do that?

736
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:19,568
Come on!

737
01:06:27,361 --> 01:06:29,902
- Go, go!
- Take this!

738
01:06:34,236 --> 01:06:38,194
What the fuck are you doing, Lucas?
Come on! Let's go!

739
01:06:39,737 --> 01:06:41,320
It's party time!

740
01:06:42,486 --> 01:06:45,777
Where is she? How did you lose her?
She was here!

741
01:06:46,487 --> 01:06:47,694
Careful!

742
01:06:48,529 --> 01:06:50,737
Where the hell is she?

743
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:57,278
Help!

744
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fucking help me!
Get it off me!
The fire extinguisher!
Get the fire extinguisher!

745
01:07:06,196 --> 01:07:07,820
Move!

746
01:07:08,988 --> 01:07:10,237
Hurry!

747
01:07:12,655 --> 01:07:13,821
Help!

748
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:18,154
- I don't know how it works.
- Its head! Hit it on the head!

749
01:07:29,947 --> 01:07:31,155
You're wrong.

750
01:07:31,489 --> 01:07:35,863
I don't know what you want from me,
but you're wrong.

751
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:52,031
Now check it.
Go back to your fucking lab and check it.

752
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:54,822
Then tell them to leave me alone.

753
01:08:04,574 --> 01:08:05,990
I'm sorry.

754
01:08:13,991 --> 01:08:17,365
- What now? We're unarmed.
- Go home.

755
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:18,699
Wait!

756
01:08:19,825 --> 01:08:21,824
What happened to your hand?

757
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,490
You've been bitten.

758
01:09:12,702 --> 01:09:14,701
Nic? Are you there?

759
01:09:14,827 --> 01:09:16,701
Angela, fuck! I saw you!
Why did you do that?

760
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:19,910
You have to trust me.
I need the access code to the lab.

761
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:21,285
What?

762
01:09:21,827 --> 01:09:24,285
Fuck! I have to prove to them
that they're wrong!

763
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:26,493
- But...
- Please!

764
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:30,118
But you bit him, Angela.
I saw it on the camera.

765
01:09:30,202 --> 01:09:31,452
Trust me, Nic!

766
01:09:31,995 --> 01:09:36,327
We can get out of this together.
But I need that code.

767
01:09:36,578 --> 01:09:37,994
Please.

768
01:09:40,745 --> 01:09:41,744
Nic!

769
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:45,119
Okay. I've got it.

770
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,453
Guzman showed me how to get it
from the camera above the door.

771
01:09:51,078 --> 01:09:55,661
Here it is.
I hope you know what you're doing.

772
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:02,495
It can't be.

773
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:19,954
- It can't be.
- Yes, it can.

774
01:10:20,872 --> 01:10:22,787
I saw it on the video.

775
01:10:23,122 --> 01:10:26,455
- I saw it enter your body.
- I don't care what you saw.

776
01:10:26,663 --> 01:10:29,330
I don't know what you're looking for,
but it's not me.

777
01:10:58,165 --> 01:11:00,581
- Harpoons.
- Yes, harpoons

778
01:11:00,665 --> 01:11:02,040
Is that all?

779
01:11:04,665 --> 01:11:06,248
- Okay.
- Fine.

780
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:09,373
We'll go down there, you'll get
the engine started and we're done.

781
01:11:09,499 --> 01:11:10,748
And then go home.

782
01:11:10,832 --> 01:11:14,665
Hang on. Angela's okay.
There's nothing in her.

783
01:11:14,916 --> 01:11:17,081
Ricarte checked, I saw it on the camera.

784
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:18,916
They're in the lab.

785
01:11:18,999 --> 01:11:20,457
We have to go and get her.

786
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:25,582
Okay, I'll go.
You two go down to the engine room.

787
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,457
We'll meet back here.

788
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:35,082
Now tell them!

789
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:38,124
It's impossible. There must be a mistake.

790
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:40,291
There's no mistake.

791
01:11:41,751 --> 01:11:45,625
Tell them right now to leave me alone
or I swear I'll kill you.

792
01:11:46,043 --> 01:11:48,000
Tell them now!

793
01:11:48,084 --> 01:11:49,791
Tell me what?

794
01:11:56,585 --> 01:11:59,667
The parasite leaves its host
when it finds a better one.

795
01:12:00,793 --> 01:12:03,667
She was the best way
to get it out of the building.

796
01:12:04,835 --> 01:12:07,626
The video doesn't lie. We've all seen it.

797
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:11,293
I don't care what you saw
but your tests don't lie either.

798
01:12:11,585 --> 01:12:12,751
That's true.

799
01:12:12,835 --> 01:12:15,418
If it were inside her you'd be infected.
She bit you.

800
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:19,627
I know! But there must be an explanation.

801
01:12:22,711 --> 01:12:24,710
She's lying.

802
01:12:29,169 --> 01:12:32,501
Is that true, Angela? Are you lying?

803
01:12:35,711 --> 01:12:38,710
And you? Are you lying?

804
01:12:41,503 --> 01:12:43,919
Why did you want the lab access code?

805
01:12:46,003 --> 01:12:48,586
You asked Nic for it. What for?

806
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:51,336
I wanted to know what they were
doing in there. Didn't you?

807
01:12:52,587 --> 01:12:56,170
Last night in the corridor, you were coming
back from the lab, weren't you?

808
01:12:58,503 --> 01:13:01,003
You used the power cut
to let the monkey out.

809
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:05,253
Really? And why would I do such a thing?

810
01:13:08,922 --> 01:13:11,378
You rescued me from the building.

811
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:14,837
We were alone almost a minute.

812
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:19,503
If that thing was in me...

813
01:13:21,713 --> 01:13:24,671
It leaves its host when
it finds a better one.

814
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,338
Wasn't that it?

815
01:13:26,796 --> 01:13:27,796
Exactly.

816
01:13:29,963 --> 01:13:32,630
So the old host is of no more use.

817
01:13:39,964 --> 01:13:42,755
You're brave Angela, I love that...

818
01:13:42,839 --> 01:13:45,005
Auto-destruct protocol activated.

819
01:13:45,632 --> 01:13:46,631
Twenty minutes.

820
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,756
AII personnel evacuate immediately.

821
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:50,339
It's over.

822
01:13:50,465 --> 01:13:52,130
Fuck you!

823
01:14:09,049 --> 01:14:11,048
Where do you think you're going, Angela?

824
01:14:13,883 --> 01:14:16,465
Careful with that, don't hurt yourself.

825
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:44,133
Evacuate immediately.

826
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:45,883
Now it's party time.

827
01:14:46,217 --> 01:14:51,592
Detonation in 18 minutes.
Evacuate immediately.

828
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

829
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:43,930
Wait!

830
01:16:58,598 --> 01:17:00,389
Get back! Get back!

831
01:17:21,308 --> 01:17:23,432
Come on, Nic! Let's go!

832
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:36,182
This way.

833
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:41,266
- Is this it, Nic?
- Yes.

834
01:17:43,184 --> 01:17:45,766
- Hurry, hurry! Shit!
- What? What's wrong?

835
01:17:47,934 --> 01:17:48,933
Nic, what's wrong?

836
01:17:49,017 --> 01:17:50,058
It won't start.

837
01:17:50,184 --> 01:17:52,350
What do you mean?
You said you knew how to start it!

838
01:17:52,517 --> 01:17:54,350
I said I could try and
that's what I'm doing!

839
01:17:54,434 --> 01:17:55,975
Don't try! Do it!

840
01:18:12,518 --> 01:18:14,434
Hurry, hurry, come on!

841
01:18:15,602 --> 01:18:17,517
Quickly! Shit!

842
01:18:18,518 --> 01:18:19,517
Fuck!

843
01:18:23,352 --> 01:18:24,351
Give me that!

844
01:18:29,019 --> 01:18:30,393
Quickly, Nic!

845
01:18:30,478 --> 01:18:32,768
Holy shit! The motor! Start it!

846
01:18:44,686 --> 01:18:45,727
Help, Nic!

847
01:18:59,395 --> 01:19:03,144
- No, no! Not now!
- Nic!

848
01:19:09,271 --> 01:19:14,145
Evacuate immediately.
Detonation in 13 minutes.

849
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,365
Evacuate immediately.

850
01:19:22,979 --> 01:19:25,354
Detonation in 13 minutes.

851
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:25,398
Evacuate immediately.
Detonation in 10 minutes.

852
01:20:26,566 --> 01:20:28,357
Evacuate immediately.

853
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:32,857
No! No! I'm okay!

854
01:20:33,733 --> 01:20:34,906
Where's Angela?

855
01:20:35,006 --> 01:20:37,482
I don't know.
Listen, we can get out of here.

856
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,149
The ship's about to explode.

857
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:45,024
Look, it's an inflatable life raft.

858
01:20:45,233 --> 01:20:46,608
We can use that motor.

859
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:48,524
Where's Angela?

860
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:53,274
Forget her! You can't help her now.
Look out for yourself.

861
01:20:54,484 --> 01:20:57,983
You and I can get out of here.
We still have time.

862
01:21:01,234 --> 01:21:02,484
Come on!

863
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:05,858
Fuck you!

864
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:15,317
Go, Nic!

865
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:26,901
Evacuate immediately.
Detonation in 8 minutes.

866
01:21:26,985 --> 01:21:28,276
Shit!

867
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:49,486
Angela!

868
01:22:07,904 --> 01:22:09,028
Shit!

869
01:22:13,029 --> 01:22:16,028
We have to get out of here.
This place is going to blow!

870
01:22:19,529 --> 01:22:20,779
The dining room...

871
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:32,904
They're going.

872
01:22:44,155 --> 01:22:45,196
Can you hear anything?

873
01:22:45,405 --> 01:22:46,404
No.

874
01:22:48,156 --> 01:22:53,197
Evacuate immediately.
Detonation in 6 minutes.

875
01:22:54,697 --> 01:22:57,489
We have to get to the deck.
Time's running out.

876
01:22:59,073 --> 01:23:01,238
The motor? Where's the motor?

877
01:23:01,698 --> 01:23:04,697
- It got stuck. I left it in the corridor.
- Fuck!

878
01:23:05,531 --> 01:23:11,364
It's okay. We'll go back,
grab it and run, okay?

879
01:23:12,157 --> 01:23:16,448
Okay, one, two, three!

880
01:23:20,074 --> 01:23:22,198
You're not leaving without me?

881
01:23:31,783 --> 01:23:33,615
After all we've been through...

882
01:23:42,742 --> 01:23:45,532
No, Angela. I'm going with you.

883
01:23:45,909 --> 01:23:47,741
I still have a lot of work to do.

884
01:24:26,952 --> 01:24:28,576
Come on! Go!

885
01:24:29,202 --> 01:24:30,785
Detonation in 4 minutes.

886
01:24:30,869 --> 01:24:31,910
Come on! Run!

887
01:24:31,994 --> 01:24:33,368
Run, run!

888
01:24:52,994 --> 01:24:54,402
Run!

889
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:20,037
The motor! Give me the motor!

890
01:25:50,206 --> 01:25:52,163
- We have to jump!
- I can't! I can't!

891
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:54,622
If you don't jump, we're going to die.

892
01:25:54,706 --> 01:25:55,705
Jump!

893
01:25:57,748 --> 01:25:59,330
I can't! I can't!

894
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:03,163
Jump!

895
01:26:07,165 --> 01:26:08,497
Nic!

896
01:26:13,123 --> 01:26:14,581
Jump, Angela!

897
01:26:33,707 --> 01:26:36,915
Jump, damn it! Jump!

898
01:26:36,999 --> 01:26:39,915
You have to Jump! Jump!

899
01:27:07,376 --> 01:27:09,000
Angela!

900
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:53,168
Nic!

901
01:27:53,252 --> 01:27:55,293
Here! Angela!

902
01:28:01,962 --> 01:28:03,710
Grab my hand.

903
01:28:10,879 --> 01:28:12,378
Take my hand, Angela.

904
01:28:35,797 --> 01:28:40,046
Come on!

905
01:28:41,255 --> 01:28:44,380
Shit! It won't start! It's jammed.

906
01:29:59,008 --> 01:30:00,883
Any cars for the Plaza Hotel?

907
01:30:01,759 --> 01:30:04,883
Car 5, I'll drop my passengers downtown
and head over there.

908
01:30:11,968 --> 01:30:13,175
Some party, eh?
