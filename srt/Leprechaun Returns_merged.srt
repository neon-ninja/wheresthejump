Hi, Katie, uh,
this is Lila Jenkins.

10
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:39,755
I'm pretty sure you said
you were gonna pick me up

11
00:02:39,757 --> 00:02:41,725
but I'm-I'm here
at the bus stop,

12
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:45,031
so I guess I'll just
keep waiting.

Uh, no.

for someone.

It's hard not to know

Not-not that I try to know it,

26
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:40,983
I just seem to end up
knowing it anyway.

27
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:43,686
Ok, well I should keep waiting
for my friend.

28
00:03:43,688 --> 00:03:44,755
I don't mind.

29

I don't usually travel out
that way much anymore,

30
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:53,665
but... you look like someone
I used to know.

31
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,108

Are you Irish?

38
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:55,891
No, no.

39
00:04:55,893 --> 00:04:56,792
Oh.

40
00:04:56,794 --> 00:04:58,627
Just a fan of the culture?

41
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:02,532
Not at all.

42
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:07,504
I... I haven't seen you before.

43
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:09,506
I'm pretty good at
remembering people.

I...

45
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:12,242
Oh, yeah, no.
It's my first year.

46
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:14,877
Well, I'm not a freshman,
it's my first year at Laramore.

47
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,112
I just transferred.

48
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:18,247
Am I talking too much?

49
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:19,249
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:20,783
I'm a little nervous.

51
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:22,754
Oh, I'm always
a little nervous.

52
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:34,097
You know, I've always wanted
to come here.

53
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:35,831
My mom used to live here.

54
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,967
In Devil's Lake?

55
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:37,934
Yeah.

56
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:39,669
Yeah, actually at the house
we're going to.

57
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:42,271
Her dad, well, my grandfather,
bought it for her.

58
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:44,139
But now the university owns it.

59
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:46,910
You're Tory Reding's daughter?

60
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:47,811
Yeah.

61
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:48,778
Yeah, I am.

62
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,114
Did you know her?

63
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:51,948
Yeah.

64
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,115
Is that who you thought
I looked like?

65
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:56,151
Yes.

66
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:58,187
How is she?

67
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:00,192
She passed away last year.

68
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:05,028
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,766
She was... nice to me.

70
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:13,102
Well, if you have any stories
about her I'd like to hear them.

71
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:14,603
She didn't tell you anything

72
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:17,908
about the place
where you're going?

73
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,742
No.

74
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:21,177
Ah.

75
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:24,848
Well, it's probably because
everything's alright now.

76
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,749
What is?

77
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,019
Nothing.

78
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:34,891
I didn't realize the house
was so far from campus.

79
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:39,265
It's far from... everything.

80
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,534
Thank you.

81
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:24,006
Everything ok?

82
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:27,076
Oh... yeah.

83
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:28,780
Everything.

84
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:32,785
We made sure of it.

85
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:48,801
But if it's not,
look in the basement.

86
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,672
Wait, what?

94
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:39,882
Yeah.

95
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:41,117
What're you doing here?

96
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,251
I thought your bus
didn't get in until 4:00.

97
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:43,987
It did.

98
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:44,853
It's 4:00?

99
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:46,021
It's 5:30.

100
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:48,924
Oh, that means you had to spend
an hour in a truck alone

101
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:52,227
with Ozzie the weirdo.

102
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:53,729
It's probably for the best,
though.

103
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:55,098
Meredith isn't even back
with the car yet.

104
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,899
Ugh.

105
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:58,404
Who the hell knows
where she went?

106
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:02,439
Ok, be warned.

107
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,140
Hmm?

108
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,907
Rose has gone all Ed Begley Jr.-

109
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:05,842
Who?

110
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:06,910
Never mind.

111
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:08,111
I'm thinking of crushing up
some of my Klonopin

112
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:09,878
and spiking her clover juice.

113
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,947
I love clover juice.

114
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:11,448
Right?

115
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,849
I'm so over kale.

116
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:16,352
We found this random clover
patch in the yard a while back.

117
00:09:16,354 --> 00:09:18,054
It inspired us to grow some
in the garden.

118
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:18,987
<i>Did you pick it up yet?</i>

119
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:20,290
Not yet!

120
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:21,924
Lila's here.

121
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:26,264
I thought she wasn't
getting in until... oh.

122
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,833
Well, it's good
you're here, Lila.

123
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:31,468
We need your help.

124
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,236
She just got here, Rosie.

125
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:36,305
Lila, do you wanna pee
outside or inside this week?

126
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:38,775
Uh, inside?

127
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:40,977
Then it's time to get to work.

128
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:42,314
Grab that wire.

129
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:46,248
Ok, Lila, this hose is gonna be
our water line

130
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,351
until we get the pipes in.

131
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:52,889
Then our water source will
be officially self-contained.

132
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:54,290
Step one of going off the grid.

133
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:57,327
Oh, wait, you guys weren't using
the well before?

134
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:00,229
No, they stopped using it years
ago because they said the water

135
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:03,500
was corrupted but I tested it
myself and it's totally fine.

136
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,200
Like, perfect.

137
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:07,837
We should have been done with
this already but it took longer

138
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,343
because someone decided to try
and jury-rig the solar panels

139
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:15,245
so she could use it
to get internet.

140
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,079
Dude, we haven't had it for,
like, three days.

141
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:18,915
Wait, there's no internet?

142
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:22,819
Yeah, no internet, no power,
and no cell service, either,

143
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:26,522
until we get these frikken'
solar panels installed.

144
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:27,391
There.

145
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,925
Once this juices up
we'll have water

146
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:31,795
and once Meredith gets back-

147
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,295
Ok, who's-who's Meredith?

148
00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:36,332
She's... she's the asshole.

149
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:38,168
Yeah, but she's the only one
at the sorority

150
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,304
that's studying native plant
landscape architecture.

151
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:42,838
So we need her.

152
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,144
Yeah, well, she loves her
native plants.

153
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:53,849
Oh...

154
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:57,187
(INDISTINCT CURSING)

155
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,588
Think, Ozzie.

156
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,325
You had your phone
at the bus stop.

157
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:04,894
You had your phone in the truck.

158
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:07,429
On the way to the house.

159
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:10,934
And now you don't.

160
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,236
It's at Tory's.

161

<i>Darnit.</i>

162
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:27,516
As long as Meredith is focused
and booze-free she's great.

163
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:30,319
I brought refreshments.

164
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:31,854
Also, I got beer.

165
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:32,856
Katie.

166
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,224
Meredith didn't tell me
you were gonna be here.

167
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,392
Didn't I?

168
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:38,394
Hey.

169
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:39,896
I'm Matt.

170
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:40,863
I'm Andy's friend.

171
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:41,930
It's nice to meet you all.

172
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:42,899
No, Meredith.

173
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:44,567
No, no, no.

174
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,002
This is not why we're here.

175
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:49,439
This is not supposed to be
a four-week party,

176
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:50,906
this is serious.

177
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:54,977
This is me being serious
with a beer in my hand.

178
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:56,913
Mmm.

179
00:11:56,915 --> 00:11:58,514
Plus, you told me to find people
that are handy.

180
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:00,282
That's Matt and Andy.

181
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:01,351
That rhymed weird.

182
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,886
Anyway, it's like six.

They aren't mutually exclusive.

185
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:10,093
Well, actually the sun doesn't
go down until about 7:00,

186
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:13,463
so, you know, we could work
for a while...

187
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:14,463
Who's the party killer?

188
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:16,232
Oh, uh, hi.

189
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,099
I'm-

190
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:18,400
That's Lila, Meredith.

191
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:21,670
Our newest Alpha Epsilon sister.

192
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:25,974
Well, I also got pizza but
if you guys don't want any...

(CLICKS TONGUE)

194
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,681
Fine!

195
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:35,083
But only because I'm starving!

196
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:37,687
We're still starting
early tomorrow!

197
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:40,490
We're still starting
super early tomorrow.

198
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:41,926
Yes.

199
00:12:43,494 --> 00:12:44,694
Ugh.

200
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:46,963
Of course she invited Andy.

201
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,631
She always has to start trouble.

202
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,133
Andy and I used to date.

203
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:54,874
I'm absolutely not going
to sleep with him tonight.

00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,723
It's just coincidence.

00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:22,460
Just a coincidence.

We... we killed you...
25 years ago.

218
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:43,506
You're dead!

226
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,463
There once was a lad
they thought died,

His flesh had melted
off his whole hide,

228
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:14,469
But he escaped from the well,
alive and quite swell,

229
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:17,205
And now he'll be killing
in stride.

231
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:24,146

to the well.

We are actually the only

to start a chapter.

you will have contacts

00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:49,298
What's this for?

254
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,233
The golden trowel?

255
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:53,735
I got that for building
yurts out of...

00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:56,806
Look, can we stop talking
about work for five minutes?

257
00:17:56,808 --> 00:18:00,909
I wanna learn more
about our new friend, Lila.

258
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:01,778
Yeah.

259
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,446
I'm sure this can't be easy
for you.

Leaving all your friends
at your other school

261
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:07,716
to hang with some strangers
in the dark.

262
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:10,453
Um, actually I lived at home
and commuted

263
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:12,722
so I didn't know
that many people.

264
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,956
But you had some friends.

265
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,024
No.

266
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:18,793
Um, I spent most of my time
taking care of my mom.

267
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:19,627
What was wrong with her?

268
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:21,731
Maybe she doesn't wanna
talk about it.

269
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,566
No, it's ok.

270
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:25,867
It's what people do, right?

271
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:29,805
Um, she had some
mental health issues.

272
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:31,906
She thought that monsters
were always trying to get her

273
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:35,011
so she never left the house.

274
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,948
And then she got cancer.

275
00:18:42,786 --> 00:18:45,856
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
said all that.

276

another beer.

00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,763
I'll help you.

279
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:55,697
I got it.

280
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:57,599
I'll help anyway.

00:18:57,601 --> 00:18:59,402
Ugh.

282
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:02,771
I love how she's all pretending
she's not gonna screw him later.

in your room, ladies.

00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:13,382
Sure.

287
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:14,649

00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,085

289
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:18,087
Careful, Matt.

290
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:19,789
Sounds like Lila's mother
was crazy

291
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,327
and that shit's hereditary.

292
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:29,098
She wasn't... she couldn't...
that wasn't very nice.

293
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,665
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

294
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm just kidding, Lila.

00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,703
I'm just tired.

297
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:36,742
Well, goodnight.

298
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:41,545
Is it just me or is she
a little weird?

299
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:44,916
Crap.

00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,358
Only you could make cleaning
look so filthy.

301
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,693
Stop it.

302
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:59,965
I'm trying to clean.

303
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:09,006

won't get you anywhere.

00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:57,599
Well, it doesn't matter!

317
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:58,867
Look at all this water!

318
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:01,803
Um, ok, well if you let me have
the well pump for a couple hours

319
00:24:01,805 --> 00:24:04,772
I can use it to drain
the water in here.

00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:07,842
Yeah, really.

at problem solving.

327
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:20,289
But, helpful, friendly hint:

328
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:23,261
maybe don't mention
your mother so much.

329
00:24:25,862 --> 00:24:27,296
What are those?

330
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:29,865
Meredith likes to juice
the fruit and vegetables

Wow.

333
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:34,837
I had no idea she was
so health conscious.

00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:35,838
Please.

to drill it straight down,

otherwise it might get loose.

341
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:11,040
It's fine to do it this way.

342
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,408
I've done it before.

343
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,810
Me too, and I'm telling you
if you-

344
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:18,047
I knew you were gonna get weird
if we had sex again.

remember?

And second of all,
this is so not about that.

349

You're literally just putting
it in wrong.

350

Or...

351
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:32,631
you're being weird.

352
00:25:33,997 --> 00:25:36,231

you ruined it.

00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:16,805
Yep. Peachy.

of you being here

what we're doing here?

Yes, I care.

A plant has one job, Rose.

It does it really well.

375

The right plant in the right
place won't only thrive

376
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:43,898
for itself it helps the world
around it thrive.

That's ok, I can fix
my own sink.

to do the interview if...

419
00:28:57,967 --> 00:29:04,306
No, no sorry, I just thought
I saw the taxi guy, but dead.

00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:35,809
Oh, gross.

546
00:38:35,811 --> 00:38:37,011
You give great head.

547
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:39,848
<i>Lila? You ok?</i>

548
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,683
IN LILA'S VOICE: <i>I'll be
right there, Matty.</i>

549
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:43,154
Wait, no!

550
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:01,172
(GROANS)

551
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:04,771
Are you ok?

552
00:39:04,773 --> 00:39:05,239
Yeah.

553
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:06,541
Wait, wait.

554
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:07,509
Did you see it?

555
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,110
Something ran past me
and knocked me down.

556
00:39:09,112 --> 00:39:11,512
Like an animal or something.

557
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:12,746
I caught it on my camera.

558
00:39:12,748 --> 00:39:14,148
No, that wasn't an animal, ok?

559
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,550
It was-it was...

560
00:39:16,552 --> 00:39:17,918
look, we need to get
out of the house.

561
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,753
I'm sure we can set traps
in the morning.

562
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:21,221
It's not exactly
the end of the world-

563
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:22,690
No, it is kind of the end.

564
00:39:22,692 --> 00:39:26,694
We seriously need to go!

565
00:39:26,696 --> 00:39:27,561
Um...

566
00:39:27,563 --> 00:39:30,197
Look, I'm not crazy, ok?

567
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,833
(LAUGHS) But how would
you know that?

568
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:33,233
You don't know me.

569
00:39:33,235 --> 00:39:35,869
None of you know me so of course
you think that I'm crazy

570
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:38,105
just like everyone thought
my mother was crazy

571
00:39:38,107 --> 00:39:42,110
and Rose told me not to talk
about my mom too much.

572
00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:43,914
We are all so screwed.

573
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,284
Where is everyone?

574
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:52,253
I don't know.

575
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:53,858
We need to find them.

576
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:25,889
God. What an asshole.

577
00:40:33,362 --> 00:40:34,195

God!

582
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,335
Why do you have to be
such a jerk all the time?

583
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,770
What's wrong?

584
00:40:42,772 --> 00:40:45,607
Hmm?

585
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,009
I think there's another box
of fuses in the barn.

586
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:50,878
If we don't turn
everything on at once

587
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,779
I think we can get the lights
working again.

588
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:55,083
Aren't you the smarty pants?

589
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:56,083
Stop it.

590
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:57,652
Hmm?

591
00:40:57,654 --> 00:41:01,154
I am not.

592
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:03,726
I'm not gonna keep doing this.

00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:14,835
<i>There once was a lass

00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:18,005

00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:21,742
<i>She laid hard with the devil,

596
00:41:21,744 --> 00:41:25,248

598
00:41:33,288 --> 00:41:35,790
A golden shower.

599
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:37,858
I don't care what the others say
about you.

600
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,360
You're a keeper.

601
00:41:40,362 --> 00:41:41,462
What do they say?

602
00:41:41,464 --> 00:41:50,038
You know... I got a glad eye
for a fellow tosspot.

603
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,773
I think I'm having
alcohol hallucinations.

604
00:41:52,775 --> 00:41:54,875
Don't be selling yourself short.

605
00:41:54,877 --> 00:41:56,779
Short?

606
00:42:05,822 --> 00:42:08,790
A walkman and a camera
all in one.

607
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,891
Impressive.

608
00:42:10,893 --> 00:42:13,761
What's a walkman?

609
00:42:13,763 --> 00:42:14,962
Forget it.

610
00:42:14,964 --> 00:42:17,431
I'm looking for something
and if you tell me where it is

611
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:20,268
I won't rip you to shreds.

612
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,902
What're you looking for?

613
00:42:21,904 --> 00:42:27,644
Come a little closer
and I'll tell you.

614
00:42:28,777 --> 00:42:30,210
Katie?

615
00:42:30,212 --> 00:42:32,246
Oh, Rose.

616
00:42:32,248 --> 00:42:34,215
Do not tell me something else
is wrong.

617
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:35,882
I filmed an animal in the house.

618
00:42:35,884 --> 00:42:37,217
It's inside?

619
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:39,487
Everyone needs to close
the doors when they go.

620
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:41,255
Ok, it is not an animal.

621
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:43,925
It's a leprechaun.

622
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:45,759
So, no animal?

623
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:47,862
Ok, I am going to try
to explain this calmly

624
00:42:47,864 --> 00:42:50,931
so that you both can see
that this is real.

625
00:42:50,933 --> 00:42:53,000
I went to get my speakers
and the leprechaun was wearing

626
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:54,869
my bear's head and it-

627
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:56,770
it attacked me
and then it ran off

628
00:42:56,772 --> 00:42:59,407
when all the lights went out.

629
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:00,208
Thank god.

630
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,342
Not for you, Lila,
for the house.

631
00:43:02,344 --> 00:43:04,411
Oh, for you that sounds...

632
00:43:04,413 --> 00:43:07,447
mental illness is a really
unfortunate problem.

633
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:10,150
Maybe she hit her head.

634
00:43:10,152 --> 00:43:12,453
There is a deranged dwarf
obsessed with money

635
00:43:12,455 --> 00:43:13,320
in the kitchen!

636
00:43:13,322 --> 00:43:14,322
(TOGETHER) What?

637
00:43:14,324 --> 00:43:15,822
Yeah, I got away before
he could do anything.

638
00:43:15,824 --> 00:43:16,824
See? That's him.

639
00:43:16,826 --> 00:43:18,058
I told you.

640
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,427
It could be a crackhead who
got a hold of the wrong stuff.

641
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:21,762
(ALL) It's a leprechaun!

642
00:43:21,764 --> 00:43:22,797
How did you get that?

643
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:25,233
Guys, I always thought
that my mom was sick, ok?

644
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,501
I mean, the strange things
that she used to say.

645
00:43:27,503 --> 00:43:28,969
That he would murder anyone
for his gold.

646
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:30,804
Yeah, well, maybe we shouldn't
take stock

647
00:43:30,806 --> 00:43:32,840
in the rantings
of a crazy person.

648
00:43:32,842 --> 00:43:35,476
She wasn't.

649
00:43:35,478 --> 00:43:36,610
Ok?

650
00:43:36,612 --> 00:43:39,846
I mean, I always thought, but...
you know, she wasn't.

651
00:43:39,848 --> 00:43:41,282
Katie and Andy are out back.

652
00:43:41,284 --> 00:43:43,287
We can't leave them.

653
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:45,286
Guys.

654
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:48,859
Guys, I really don't think
this is a good-

655
00:43:51,326 --> 00:43:53,730
I gotta go take a leak.

656
00:43:54,429 --> 00:43:58,034
No, no, no, no, that's latex
which isn't biodegrade...

657
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:04,441
I make such bad choices.

658
00:44:08,844 --> 00:44:09,811
Come on, Katie.

659
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:14,148
I don't wanna have another talk
right now, ok?

tearing out their tongues.

663
00:44:22,157 --> 00:44:23,523
What the hell are you?

664
00:44:23,525 --> 00:44:27,962
I'm a leprechaun and I've come
to get me gold back.

665
00:44:27,964 --> 00:44:29,596
You wouldn't know anything
about that now, would you?

666
00:44:29,598 --> 00:44:30,801

you're talking about.

No, no, no, no.

728
00:49:05,641 --> 00:49:07,373
I- I don't think
that he's a cannibal.

Well, he could be a cannibal,
I mean...

730
00:49:09,377 --> 00:49:11,378
No one cares, Matt!

731
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,213
No, he seems a little
too refined, though.

I mean, he wears
that frikken' jaunty hat!

733

Ok.

It's the right thing to do.

surprising coming from you.

739

Right?

00:49:57,259 --> 00:50:00,663

killing that one.

01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:50,904
I did what you wanted.

910
01:01:50,906 --> 01:01:51,838
I left Lila for you.

911
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,040
You said you wouldn't lay
a hand on me.

912
01:01:54,042 --> 01:01:56,041
I suppose I did.

Let's go.

916
01:02:10,558 --> 01:02:12,992
I won't lay a hand on you.

917
01:02:12,994 --> 01:02:14,159
Really?

918
01:02:14,161 --> 01:02:15,598
We're friends.

919
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:39,652

You promised!

923
01:03:13,221 --> 01:03:14,721
Why are you doing this?

924
01:03:14,723 --> 01:03:17,090
I promised I wouldn't lay
a hand on you.

925
01:03:17,092 --> 01:03:20,396
I didn't say I wouldn't
kill you.

Is everything alright?

Yeah, I think I can get this
working with my phone.

You guys keep going.

01:04:00,402 --> 01:04:02,434

in case it came back.

to kill us for?

he wants then we just-

1021
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:09,841
we have to give it to him.

months ago, ok?

it was just here,

01:09:24,959 --> 01:09:28,461
I only took what I needed
for the house project.

1031
01:09:28,463 --> 01:09:30,095
I- I kept a record of it

1032
01:09:30,097 --> 01:09:31,797
so I would know how much
to buy back

1033
01:09:31,799 --> 01:09:34,701
once I could afford it
after everyone saw what I-

1034
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:38,738
what we did with
the house project.

1035
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:41,541

get away.

The only people that gave money
were my stepmother out of guilt

1044
01:09:58,927 --> 01:10:01,094
and some dude from Albuquerque
who asked if I would send

1045
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:03,363
a naked picture of myself
in return for 20 bucks,

1046
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,698

1047
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,935
So I funded it all myself.

1048
01:10:08,937 --> 01:10:11,871
But I only took as much
as I needed.

1049
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:14,040

and returning it

when you first found it?

1053
01:10:21,816 --> 01:10:22,614
Not much more.

1054
01:10:22,616 --> 01:10:25,717
Well, what does
your notebook say?

1055
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:29,788
I guess like...

1056
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:30,689
Oh my god.

1057
01:10:30,691 --> 01:10:32,792
So overflowing?

1058
01:10:32,794 --> 01:10:33,859
Ok, look.

1059
01:10:33,861 --> 01:10:35,795
We can just take it back
to the Cash for Gold place

1060
01:10:35,797 --> 01:10:36,796
and get it back.

1061
01:10:36,798 --> 01:10:38,631
It's all the way in Bismarck.

1062
01:10:38,633 --> 01:10:39,698

1063
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,967
What have you done, Rose?

1064
01:10:41,969 --> 01:10:43,802
Now we have nothing
to offer him!

1065
01:10:43,804 --> 01:10:45,704
Oh my god, oh my god,
he's gonna kill us all.

01:10:45,706 --> 01:10:46,773

his gold then...

1069
01:10:50,712 --> 01:10:52,545
then there's only one thing
left to do.

1070
01:10:52,547 --> 01:10:53,578

01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,846
No.

1072
01:10:54,848 --> 01:10:57,683
We use his strengths
against him.

1073
01:10:57,685 --> 01:11:00,155
And we kill him.

1074
01:11:04,025 --> 01:11:06,192
Where are you going?

1075
01:11:06,194 --> 01:11:07,193
Ok, I don't know, actually.

1076
01:11:07,195 --> 01:11:08,161
That just seemed like
the right thing to do

1077
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:10,195
but we should probably make
a plan first.

1078
01:11:10,197 --> 01:11:11,465
Yeah.

1079
01:11:25,879 --> 01:11:28,213
Ok, well, we know his strengths.

1080
01:11:28,215 --> 01:11:29,881
I mean, that's something.

1081
01:11:29,883 --> 01:11:31,716
Yeah, but we don't know
what his weaknesses are

1082
01:11:31,718 --> 01:11:34,787
and we can't just Google
how to kill a leprechaun.

1083
01:11:34,789 --> 01:11:36,788
Wait, can we?

1084
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:37,957
If we had power, yeah.

1085
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:41,060
We could just reboot the
internet and call the police.

1086
01:11:41,062 --> 01:11:44,564
Wait, is there a way to turn
the power back on?

1087
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,966

01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:58,845
Lila, why didn't he take
the coin around your neck?

1090
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:01,980
Well, he tried but it burned
his hand when he grabbed it.

1091
01:12:01,982 --> 01:12:03,552
Let me see it.

1092
01:12:05,553 --> 01:12:07,487
I think it's fool's gold.

1093
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,087
How can you tell?

1094
01:12:09,089 --> 01:12:10,857
Andy tried to pass off
this bracelet he got

1095
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:12,992
for my birthday as real gold.

1096
01:12:12,994 --> 01:12:14,627
It wasn't.

1097
01:12:14,629 --> 01:12:17,162
Lila, fool's good
is iron pyrite.

1098
01:12:17,164 --> 01:12:18,163
Iron.

1099
01:12:18,165 --> 01:12:19,165
That's a thing, right?

1100
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:20,733
That sounds like a thing
we can stop him with.

1101
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,533
Oh, yeah.

1102
01:12:21,535 --> 01:12:22,801
And four-leaf clovers.

1103
01:12:22,803 --> 01:12:23,836
How do you know that?

1104
01:12:23,838 --> 01:12:24,703
I just do.

1105
01:12:24,705 --> 01:12:26,506
Where are we gonna get
that much iron?

1106

this off?

We can do this.

1110
01:12:39,687 --> 01:12:40,956
We can do this.

1111
01:12:52,866 --> 01:12:54,567
Well, we have to give it to him.

1112
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:56,836
That's easy for you, you have
protection around your neck.

1113
01:12:56,838 --> 01:12:58,871
Ok, I thought we said that we
were all gonna stick together?

1114
01:12:58,873 --> 01:13:00,840
We have been, and look
where that got us!

Well, fine.

1122
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,586
Then I'll just give
it to him myself.

1123
01:13:13,588 --> 01:13:14,686
- Fine.

1124
01:13:14,688 --> 01:13:15,156

1131

It's yours.

1132

Looks like your friends
didn't agree with your plan.

1133
01:14:04,172 --> 01:14:06,305
They didn't want me
to give it to you.

But if I didn't
you'd just kill us.

Ok?

1136
01:14:12,112 --> 01:14:15,982
So it's yours, just-
just take it and leave.

Maybe you need to be
more fiscally responsible.

1267
01:22:42,789 --> 01:22:43,792
Maybe you...

1268
01:22:48,262 --> 01:22:50,828
need to liquidate!

1269
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:53,700
(CHOKING)

1270
01:23:08,214 --> 01:23:11,216
It's a little too little,
a little too late.

1271
01:23:11,218 --> 01:23:16,622
The best you can hope for
is a painful fate.

(CACKLING)

1273
01:23:20,694 --> 01:23:23,228
Hey, you minuscule monster.

1274
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:24,766
It's time to cash out.

1275
01:23:30,404 --> 01:23:32,804
Oh, shite!

1276
01:23:32,806 --> 01:23:34,805
How is that for energy
efficient?

1277
01:23:34,807 --> 01:23:38,612
(SCREAMING)

1278
01:24:02,937 --> 01:24:04,302
We need to go!

1279
01:24:04,304 --> 01:24:05,770
Come on, come on!

1280
01:24:05,772 --> 01:24:07,674
(CONTINUES TO SCREAM)

1281
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:11,779

Wait!

1288
01:24:37,771 --> 01:24:39,537
Dying in the basement
is your best idea?

1289
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:41,707
Ok, Katie, we are not going
to die!

1290
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:43,242
(THUD)

1291
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:45,213
Hopefully!

1292
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:51,949
Ok. Ok, come on.

Eat a dick, Ass Baggins.

1298

(COUGHING)

1302
01:25:31,792 --> 01:25:34,025
Oh my god.

1303
01:25:34,027 --> 01:25:36,761
Ow, I think it punctured
my trapezius.

1304
01:25:36,763 --> 01:25:38,630
What?

1305
01:25:38,632 --> 01:25:39,730
It's ok, I'll be ok.

1306
01:25:39,732 --> 01:25:40,297
Ok, ok.

1307
01:25:40,299 --> 01:25:41,466
Um, come on, come on.

1308
01:25:41,468 --> 01:25:42,971
We gotta go.

(COUGHING)

1311
01:26:30,851 --> 01:26:32,451
Why are you doing that?

1312
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:33,652
What?

1313
01:26:33,654 --> 01:26:35,790
You don't see...

1314
01:26:37,857 --> 01:26:38,659
<i>See what?</i>

1315
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,794
<i>See what?</i>

1316
01:26:41,861 --> 01:26:44,128
Nothing. Nothing.

1317
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:46,500
I don't see anything, either.

1318
01:26:48,968 --> 01:26:50,804
Thank you.

1319
01:27:05,451 --> 01:27:07,922
What the hell happened here?!

01:27:10,891 --> 01:27:12,791
Are you girls ok?

1321
01:27:12,793 --> 01:27:14,760
Yeah.

1322
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:19,163
We just learned that sometimes
the best green footprint...

1323
01:27:19,165 --> 01:27:21,069
is no footprint.

1324
01:27:30,777 --> 01:27:32,476
Actually, we're probably
gonna need a ride

1325
01:27:32,478 --> 01:27:34,412
'cause I'm losing a lot
of blood, so...

1326
01:27:34,414 --> 01:27:35,882
Ok, yep.
