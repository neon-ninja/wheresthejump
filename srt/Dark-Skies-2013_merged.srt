1
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,805
<i>Here we are, top of the eighth,</i>

2
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,928
<i>and Fourth of July
is just around the corner...</i>

3
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,324
- How's the specimen?
- His tail came off.

4
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,209
Well...
maybe you should let him go.

5
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,170
I'm gonna nurse him back to health.

6
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,324
I don't know lizards...
is that compassion or torture?

7
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,251
Uh, I'm gonna go with the latter.
You gonna want cheese?

8
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,363
Yes! Did you text Jesse?

9
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,568
Yeah, he's with Rat Face.

10
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,927
He said he'd be home
eight minutes ago.

11
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,570
I'll Call him.

12
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,245
And it's Ratner, not Rat Face.
Don't be cruel.

13
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,324
Not being cruel.
It's descriptive.

14
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,244
There's something wrong with that kid.

15
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,404
Hey, we got people coming over in five.
Get your butt home.

16
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,047
An epic game of Modern Warfare.

17
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,611
<i>Yeah, that's
what save buttons are for, pal.</i>

18
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,723
OK, I'm coming.
Tell Dad to chill.

19
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,245
<i>OK. Bye.</i>

20
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,246
Dog, this shit is weak, man.

21
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,642
I've totally done this stuff,
like, so many times.

22
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,202
<i>You've been</i> a <i>bad girl.</i>

23
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,091
<i>Well, I guess
you better punish me, then.</i>

24
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,969
<i>Ooh, that feels so good.</i>

25
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,883
- Boy, this beer works.
- Works every time.

26
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,646
The Fed can prime
the pump in DC all it wants,

27
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,406
but all it's gonna do is raise the price
for a cup of coffee in California.

28
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,042
- Mm-hmm.
- Alicia told me he's back in rehab.

29
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,646
I think you have to point
the finger at the parents.

30
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,609
Do you know they have
an open relationship?

31
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,921
Wait. What?

32
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,411
How long have you known this?

33
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,131
- What kind of relationship?
- Eat your food.

34
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,282
Tell me everything you know,
right now.

35
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,370
You're gonna kill that thing.

36
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,807
No, I'm not.
I'm re-habiting him.

37
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,691
It's "rehabilitate," brainiac.

38
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,968
- A three-year-old?
- Let's go four.

39
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,921
OK, four-year-old.
A compromise. Four.

40
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,407
I got two scary words
for you, though: China. India.

41
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,289
I'm terrified.

42
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,843
I'll give you a dollar
if you eat that potato salad.

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,890
- A dollar?
- I just don't know what you see in him.

44
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,048
- You're so much smarter than he is.
- Ratner's smart.

45
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,009
He's so not smart.

46
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,050
That stunt he pulled
with the car, that's smart?

47
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,965
His parents forgot about it.
Why can't you?

48
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,487
- Oh. Hello. Why can't you?
- Oh, come on. Come on.

49
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,881
Daniel... Come on.

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,083
I just think you should be hanging out
with kids your age, that's all.

51
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,765
I'm old enough.

52
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,931
<i>...the Dow Jones Industrial Average</i>

53
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,447
<i>plummeted another 148 points today,</i>

54
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,762
<i>causing some analysts to predict
a major recession on the horizon...</i>

55
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,888
I have my father's hair.

56
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,087
Your father doesn't have hair.

57
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,089
That's something to look forward to.

58
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,730
- Daniel.
- Sorry.

59
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,886
Daniel, come on.

60
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,451
I've gotta prep these viewings.

61
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,489
We need this.

62
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,811
"Recovering my courage
with an effort,"

63
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,521
I take a cautious look out.
In the middle of the room...

64
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,364
<i>...in front of my father,</i>

65
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,841
<i>stands the Sandman,
the bright light of the lamp</i>

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,570
<i>"falling full upon his face."</i>

67
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,291
Lunar Base to Command Control. Over.

68
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,171
<i>Go for Command Control.</i>

69
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,767
Why does the Sandman
steal people's eyes?

70
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,444
So he can feed 'em
to his children on the moon.

71
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,524
Why doesn't he feed them
something else?

72
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,524
Sam, everyone knows
eyes taste the best.

73
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,808
<i>You think he'll steal mine?</i>

74
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,608
<i>Maybe.</i>

75
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,489
<i>But yours are still pretty small.</i>

76
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,762
<i>He'd probably take mine first.</i>

77
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,170
Lunar Base, over and out.

78
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,204
You guys gotta keep
this door locked tonight, OK?

79
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,004
- I didn't touch it.
- Me neither.

80
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,721
What kind of animal eats all the lettuce
but leaves the bacon?

81
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,245
A rabbit.

82
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,210
A very large rabbit,
with opposable thumbs.

83
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,250
Maybe it was a mutant lizard who's mad
at Sammy for imprisoning her offspring.

84
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,290
No... Don't listen to your brother.
You want juice?

85
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,487
Ahh! Gotta go.

86
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,367
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

87
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,846
I have a second showing at two
up on Croft.

88
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,286
I should be back before then.

89
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,484
Oh.

90
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,560
Luck.

91
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,440
You were laid off from Jacobson?

92
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,491
Uh, yes, sir. The development I was on
ran into cash flow issues,

93
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,847
and the entire design team was let go.

94
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,047
But I was thinking of making
a switch anyway, so...

95
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,887
How did it go?

96
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,167
- It went well.
- Really?

97
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,405
- When do they get back to you?
- Mm... next week, most likely.

98
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,370
Daniel, that's great.

99
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,488
I'm proud of you.

100
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,846
I want to hear
the other one again.

101
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,408
<i>"Ah, little wretch, little wretch..."</i>

102
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,608
Lunar Base
to Command Control, over.

103
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,643
Enough scary stories, Sammy.

104
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,729
Say good night to your brother.

105
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,123
Mom says I have to say good night.

106
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,760
- <i>Night, Mom.</i>
- <i>Night,</i> Jess.

107
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,129
You, sleep, now.

108
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,647
- Night, Mom.
- Good night.

109
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

110
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,327
Oh, Sammy, you scared me.

111
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,562
I had a bad dream.

112
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,881
You had a bad dream?

113
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,840
Oh, it's OK. It's OK now.

114
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,207
It's OK now.

115
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,928
Sammy...

116
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,805
do you know who did this?

117
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,561
The Sandman.

118
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,121
The Sandman?
Is that one of your toys?

119
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,203
He was in my dream.

120
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,082
And did he tell you to do this
in your dream?

121
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,122
He did it himself,
before he came to my room.

122
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,487
Well, there's no sign
of forced entry.

123
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,041
You sure all the doors
and windows were locked?

124
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,646
Yeah, I'm sure.
We check them every night.

125
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,644
And other than the food,
nothing's missing?

126
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,451
- No.
- No. Nothing.

127
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,251
OK, well, as I see it,

128
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,283
Either the person who did this
had a key or, uh, it was...

129
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,645
someone in the house.

130
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,969
Uh... no, I don't think so.

131
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,360
No, we were all asleep.

132
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,124
I'm not saying
it's anything sinister.

133
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,090
People do a lot of strange
things when they sleep.

134
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,890
Got a call over on Langford once,

135
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,601
family kept waking up to a mess
in the kitchen every morning.

136
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,525
Turns out the teenage daughter
was a sleep eater.

137
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,682
- A sleep eater?
- Yeah.

138
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,605
It's like a sleep walker,
but instead of getting up

139
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,569
and walking in their sleep,

140
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,770
they actually go to the kitchen and eat.

141
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,649
It's the craziest thing.

142
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,647
Look, Officer,
this wasn't a cooking mess.

143
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,963
This was like a mathematician's
idea of a geometry joke.

144
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,361
I don't know whether to be
pissed or impressed.

145
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,206
Well, maybe you just got some
real bright kids on your hands.

146
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,442
- I see you have an alarm.
- Yeah.

147
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,768
We have the system,
but we let the service lapse.

148
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,922
Trying to cut back a little.

149
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,162
Yeah. Well, I'd suggest
turning it back on.

150
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,560
It's money well spent.

151
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,165
Be safe.

152
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,561
Three bedroom, two bath.
It needs a bit of updating,

153
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,849
but that's just a chance
to really make it yours.

154
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,485
Wait till you see the kitchen.

155
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,290
I checked the comps, honey.

156
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,124
This is a great buying opportunity.

157
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,044
You know, I gotta take this.

158
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,248
Why don't you ladies keep going.
I'm gonna catch up.

159
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,845
Sure.

160
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,730
OK... come here... It's OK.

161
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,848
It's OK. It's all right.

162
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,480
- Do you need anything?
- No-no-no, I got it.

163
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,768
Hang on. Here we go. OK, OK.

164
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,888
OK. Deep breath. Ready?

165
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,005
- You better?
- Mm-hmm.

166
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,640
Yeah?
All right. Good girl.

167
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,881
It gets easier.

168
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,402
My oldest, Jesse, was sick
all the time when he was little.

169
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,007
It was like he was allergic
to the entire world.

170
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,481
How'd you get through it?

171
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,688
I worried a lot.

172
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,801
Yeah. And I took it day by day.

173
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,407
And he got older and the episodes
happened less and less and...

174
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,365
Now, hardly ever a cold.

175
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,651
That sounds nice.

176
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,162
So what do you think of this place?

177
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,883
Is it a "buying opportunity"?

178
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,444
I know I'm supposed to be
selling you...

179
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,807
But you can probably do better.

180
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,244
<i>A silent hunter, the great white shark</i>

181
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,290
<i>stalks its prey
with near invisibility,</i>

182
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,202
<i>its attack both unstoppable and fatal.
Here off the coast of...</i>

183
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,051
I think maybe we should cut
back on the cable for a while.

184
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,969
Well, maybe we should
just wait a week,

185
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,243
because you might get
the good news on that job.

186
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,120
I...

187
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,524
Yeah, I don't...
I don't think I got it, Lace.

188
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,160
Wait a second. I don't understand.
You said it went great.

189
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,810
Oh, no, it went OK. It did.

190
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,169
But there's just...
there's a lot of competition.

191
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,687
So...

192
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,968
- You lied?
- Come on, Lace.

193
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,845
You did, didn't you?

194
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,002
Why would you do that, Daniel?

195
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,524
Look, I just didn't...

196
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,882
I wanted to not give you bad news.

197
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,280
- OK.
- For once.

198
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,761
- So you lied about it?
- I didn't lie...

199
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,049
exactly. I just...

200
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,009
You know, you've been
so stressed lately...

201
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,844
Do not do that!
Do not make this about me.

202
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,766
<i>Lunar Base to Command Control.</i>

203
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,890
<i>Come in, Command Control. Over.</i>

204
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,604
Go for Command Control.

205
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,481
Picking up hostile transmission
on all frequencies. Over.

206
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,120
<i>Just ignore them, Sammy.
Try to go to sleep.</i>

207
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,530
<i>Command Control?</i>

208
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,569
Yes, Lunar Base?

209
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,287
Do you think Dad's gonna leave?

210
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,090
No.

211
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,169
Why would you say that, Sammy?

212
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,202
<i>Sammy, why would you say that?</i>

213
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,569
'Cause Tau told me
his parents argued every night,

214
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,724
then his dad moved
to an apartment by the airport,

215
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,969
<i>and now he only sees him
on the weekends.</i>

216
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,726
Don't worry Sammy,
Dad's not moving anywhere.

217
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,484
Now try and go to sleep.

218
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,485
Stay with your brother!

219
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,849
- Hello?
- <i>This is City One Protection.</i>

220
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,490
<i>May I have your name
and password, please?</i>

221
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,201
Yes, my... It's Daniel Barrett.
My password is "Lacy214."

222
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,846
<i>Thank you, Mr. Barrett. Are you
currently experiencing a break-in?</i>

223
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,361
Uh, I don't think so.
I don't know.

224
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,845
We were sleeping,
the alarm went off.

225
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,765
Uh, I'm at the keypad now.

226
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,800
Uh, it's not telling me
what sensor was tripped.

227
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,491
- You there?
- Yes. Yes, Mr. Barrett.

228
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,689
<i>We believe this was a false alarm
due to a system malfunction.</i>

229
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,929
What kind of malfunction?
What sensor was tripped?

230
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,651
- <i>All of them.</i>
- What?

231
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,043
<i>The system is reporting
that all eight entry points to the house</i>

232
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,123
<i>were breached at the same time.</i>

233
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,442
I don't understand.
How is that possible?

234
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,443
<i>We're not sure what happened either,</i>

235
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,047
<i>but we'll send someone out tomorrow
at 9:00 a.m. to check your system.</i>

236
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,123
<i>We apologize for the inconvenience.</i>

237
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,924
OK. Thank you.

238
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,723
They said it was a false alarm.

239
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,723
A system malfunction.

240
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,562
Daniel, what's happening?

241
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,365
Mr. Barrett, have you talked
to your children about this?

242
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,126
Yeah... They both said
they were asleep.

243
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,164
And you're sure
they're telling you the truth?

244
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,805
Hey, I've got kids, too. Right?

245
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,406
I mean, they do stuff like this to get
your attention, then they lie about it.

246
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,291
Happens all the time.
It's no reflection on you as a parent.

247
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,647
Oh.

248
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,404
I understand how that can happen,

249
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,927
but this doesn't seem
like one of those things.

250
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,248
My wife doesn't feel safe
in the house right now.

251
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,529
Listen, I know this can be tough,
but... is there any reason

252
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,200
for either of your children
to be angry with you or your wife?

253
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,443
Any... discord in the family?

254
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,449
Kids have a way
of picking up on these things.

255
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,405
Excuse me, Mr. Barrett?
I'm all through here.

256
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,001
I couldn't find anything
wrong with the system.

257
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,605
So what set it off?

258
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,161
Well, it could be any number of things.
It's technical.

259
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,443
Bottom line, though, I don't think
anybody actually tried to get in.

260
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,483
Look, do either of you have
anything that you want to tell us?

261
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,165
Like What?

262
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,890
Um...

263
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,203
Uh, look,
we know things have been

264
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,408
a little strained around here lately.

265
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:11,044
And... when that happens,
that can create feelings

266
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,929
towards us that, um...

267
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,889
It's about the photos, isn't it?

268
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,927
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

269
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,048
Did either of you take them?

270
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,601
We were sleeping.
How could we take them?

271
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,844
Sammy?

272
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,368
Sam, did you have that dream again?

273
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,204
About the Sandman?

274
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,091
What dream?

275
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,086
Samuel...

276
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,280
did the Sandman take the photos?

277
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,807
It's OK. You can tell us.

278
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,962
I can't.

279
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,963
What's going on, Lace?

280
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,282
What do you mean, you can't?

281
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,848
He told me not to say.

282
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,091
Daniel, stop.
I don't care about the photos right now.

283
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,681
Daniel, are we gonna talk about this?

284
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,330
Now you want to talk?

285
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,804
When were you gonna tell me
he was having these dreams?

286
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,126
I didn't think it was a big deal.

287
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,930
- Kids have nightmares.
- Yeah.

288
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,600
Yeah. They don't act them out, though.

289
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,370
Obviously, I was wrong.

290
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,204
It's not funny, Sammy.

291
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,124
Just tell them where the photos are.

292
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,203
But I don't know where they are.

293
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,930
I didn't take them.

294
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,129
The Sandman isn't real.

295
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,089
You do understand that, right?

296
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,922
Daniel, stop!
What are we gonna do about this?

297
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,003
I don't know, Lace.
What do you want to do?

298
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,283
Want to put him in therapy?
How we gonna pay for that?

299
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,205
He's our son, not a cable bill.

300
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,125
I know, Lace.

301
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,409
Karen says she knows someone
who talked to Shelly

302
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,722
when she was going
through some stuff.

303
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,888
I guess she works
on a sliding scale, so...

304
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,247
Did you tell them
we were having money trouble?

305
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,923
Daniel, stop!

306
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,810
OK.

307
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,008
Let's just wait a few days, all right?

308
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,768
What do you keep scratching at?

309
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,560
Nothing.
It's, like, a bite or something.

310
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,120
There they are. Go get 'em.

311
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,370
Hey, there he is.

312
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,441
Bobby, get up!
Get up. You're not hurt.

313
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,568
There you go! Now get the ball!

314
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,481
Hey, so Karen says you guys are,
what, looking for a therapist for Sammy?

315
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,691
No.

316
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,161
No, no, it's nothing.

317
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,526
It's a rough spot.

318
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,284
Is everything all right at home?

319
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,364
- Yeah.
- Ew!

320
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,410
He peed himself!

321
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,810
Sammy?

322
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,602
- Sammy?
- Ew, he peed himself!

323
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,683
Hey, buddy,
if you had to go to the bathroom,

324
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,922
you should've just told me.

325
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,844
Sammy, what's wrong?

326
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,005
Hey.

327
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,289
Sammy, what's wrong? Sammy.

328
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,480
No. It's OK.

329
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,490
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Sammy, stop! Sammy!

330
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,483
<i>Sammy, $109'-!</i>

331
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,483
But you're sure he's OK now?

332
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,564
OK, just get home. I'm here.

333
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,210
Bye.

334
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

335
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, shit.
God.

336
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,771
<i>_</i>

337
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,321
They just hit the house,
hundreds of them.

338
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,847
Karen, I can't even
begin to describe it.

339
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,166
Yeah. No, there's...

340
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,845
We got an army of people
over here right now.

341
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,889
No, you guys, don't touch it!

342
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,684
They could be contaminated.

343
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,126
We're just looking at them.

344
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,328
OK, but just, both of you,
don't touch them.

345
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,045
Yeah.

346
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,851
Dude, this is awesome!

347
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,049
This is definitely
the start of an outbreak.

348
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,965
- Bitch, you're gonna get quarantined!
- Shut up.

349
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,849
If I am, so are you.

350
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,248
We'll run autopsies on a sample,
see if they're sick.

351
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,681
We haven't had any reports
of avian flu

352
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,287
in the local starling population,
but it could be something new.

353
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,329
Well, and if they weren't sick?

354
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,404
Then we'll look
for environmental causes...

355
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,562
uh, hail storms, lightning.

356
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,200
We're coming up on the Fourth,
so you can't discount fireworks.

357
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,011
They'll disorient a flock pretty easily.

358
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,241
Look, uh, it'd be great if we get
some answers to what caused this.

359
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,641
We've been having some...

360
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,968
uh, strange things
going on around here,

361
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,602
and it would just be really nice
if this wasn't adding to it.

362
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,127
Uh, we'll do our best, Mr. Barrett.

363
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,285
I'll give you a call.

364
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,244
OK. Thank you.

365
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,203
Sam, Dad said
you got scared in the park today?

366
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,761
You don't remember
screaming at the park, buddy?

367
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,490
What do you remember?

368
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:10,121
I remember going in the grass
to play with the other kids.

369
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,805
Yeah?

370
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,089
Then I wasn't me any more.

371
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,929
Hey, uh, Sam, why don't you
head up and, uh, brush your teeth,

372
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,684
and I'll tuck you in, OK?

373
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,330
- OK.
- OK.

374
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,448
I'll be right up.

375
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,891
Thanks, pal.

376
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,683
OK. OK. We'll call
the therapist in the morning.

377
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,764
I'll figure how
to pay for it somehow.

378
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,691
Can't hear any.

379
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
What do you mean?
Sam?
I promise,
I won't tell them anything.

380
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,090
- What's going on?!
- There was someone...

381
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,248
- I... I just turned on the light.
- What?

382
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,640
- There was someone in the room.
- What did you see?

383
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,200
The light, and there was someone...

384
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,366
- Sam?
- There was someone in here!

385
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,807
Sam?! Sam!

386
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,241
What happened?

387
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,731
Sam?<i>'</i>What going on?

388
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,251
Sam?

389
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,242
Sammy? Sam!

390
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,971
Sam?

391
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,649
Sam!

392
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,802
Oh, shit!

393
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,451
Sam!

394
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,490
Hey, what the hell are you doing? Sam.

395
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,564
Sam.

396
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,449
Mom?

397
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,204
It's OK.

398
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,203
Sam! Wake up.

399
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,849
Why are we outside?

400
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,048
Shh.

401
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,161
They don't know how he got out
without setting off the alarm.

402
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,001
They're gonna send someone to check
the system again in the morning.

403
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,088
Daniel...

404
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,891
I saw someone in Sam's room.

405
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,247
The window was locked, Lacy.
You were standing by the door.

406
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,449
If somebody was there,
where'd he go?

407
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,163
I don't know. I can't explain it.

408
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,244
But I saw someone
standing over Sam's bed.

409
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,483
And when I turned on the lights,
both of them were gone.

410
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,051
You didn't see Sammy in his room.

411
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,009
You couldn't have.
He was already outside.

412
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,525
So you think I imagined it?

413
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,129
Lace“.

414
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,648
What is this?
What are we talking about?

415
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,282
I don't know. I'm...

416
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,051
I'm just saying,
something's going on.

417
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,601
This is me now. It's not Sam.

418
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,604
Look, I hear you.l do.

419
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,083
But we've got enough to handle right now
without getting crazy.

420
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,571
It's not gonna help anything.

421
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,801
What the fuck?

422
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,006
Light her up!

423
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,884
Butt in your face! Butt in your face!

424
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,444
Listen, you can't tell
your mom about this place.

425
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,002
What, you think
I'm gonna get you in trouble?

426
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,321
Promise?

427
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,887
What are you gonna do for me?

428
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,527
You've... been a bad girl.

429
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,008
What are you doing? Stop it!
Dude, what is wrong with you?

430
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,003
Sorry, I...

431
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,806
Have you ever even
kissed a girl before?

432
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,010
Come here.

433
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,885
Pucker your lips.

434
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,691
Close your eyes.

435
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,087
If someone's
coming into this house,

436
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,686
we'll see him on this.

437
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,129
This isn't some kind of twisted way
for you to spice up our sex life, is it?

438
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,600
That wasn't the idea.

439
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,286
But I like the way you think.

440
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,331
This is gonna solve it, Lace.

441
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,444
<i>Do you think he's watching us?</i>

442
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,284
<i>You mean Dad?</i>

443
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,965
Yeah.

444
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,482
<i>Probably.</i>

445
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,211
Do you think there's somebody here?

446
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,209
No.

447
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,409
<i>Then why did Dad
put up the cameras?</i>

448
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,243
<i>'Cause he's just making sure.</i>

449
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,166
- Command Control?
- Yes, <i>Lunar Base?</i>

450
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,209
I'm scared.

451
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,802
Don't worry, Sammy.

452
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,770
I won't let anything happen to you.

453
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,726
<i>I promise.</i>

454
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,608
What the...?

455
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,084
So, three bedroom, two bath.

456
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,891
It needs a bit of updating,
but that's really a chance

457
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,651
to make it your own,
get exactly what you want.

458
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,689
Hm.

459
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,244
What do you think, honey?

460
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,971
It looks like a lot of work.

461
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,891
I have to say, you know,
I know this area pretty well now,

462
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,726
and you're not gonna do
much better for this price.

463
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,089
Um, how flexible do you think
the sellers will be on the terms?

464
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,725
They are highly motivated.

465
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,326
I mean, I think
we can be very...

466
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,001
Are you OK?

467
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,044
Lacy?

468
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,010
Lacy?"

469
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

470
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,521
<i>Lacy!</i> Oh, my God!

471
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,762
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, it's Pete.</i>

472
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,129
<i>What the hell happened to you?
I've been calling for hours.</i>

473
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,442
<i>I got a message from a very distressed
client saying you had</i>

474
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,285
<i>some kind of a breakdown in the middle
of the walk-through this morning.</i>

475
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,124
<i>They were about to call 911,
for Christ's sakes,</i>

476
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,489
- <i>but you Walked out of the house.</i>
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

477
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,961
<i>Look, I know it's been
rough out there,</i>

478
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,248
<i>but maybe you should
take a break for a little while.</i>

479
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,402
No, Pete, I can't do that.

480
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,643
<i>OK, well, the thing is
I'm not asking, Lacy.</i>

481
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,929
<i>Your clients took their business
over to Sunshine Realty.</i>

482
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,084
<i>I'm sorry, kiddo. Just call me
when you're feeling better.</i>

483
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,049
Oh, God.

484
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,562
- Pete, please let me explain, OK?
- Mrs. Barrett?

485
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,405
<i>This is Janice Rhodes
from the National Wildlife Centre.</i>

486
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,841
<i>I got your husband's voice mail,
so I thought I'd try you.</i>

487
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,242
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, go ahead.

488
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,323
<i>I have some new information
about the incident,</i>

489
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,007
<i>but I'm afraid it raises
more questions than it answers.</i>

490
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,845
Oh, w-what kind of questions?

491
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,321
<i>The birds were negative for avian ﬂu.</i>

492
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,882
<i>But what we did determine
is that the impact trajectories</i>

493
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,202
<i>indicate the birds were
part of three different flocks</i>

494
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,204
<i>and not one,
as we originally assumed.</i>

495
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,489
I don't understand.
So what does that mean?

496
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,927
<i>What it means is
that three different migrations</i>

497
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,766
<i>coming from three different directions
flew into your house, Mrs. Barrett.</i>

498
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,720
<i>It's as if something was
drawing them to your home.</i>

499
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,163
Have you been working on
anything since leaving Jacobson?

500
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,243
You know, I've been tinkering
with a few personal projects,

501
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,290
but pretty much enjoying
just being a stay-at-home dad.

502
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,886
Oh, really?
Oh, man, what I wouldn't give

503
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,769
for a little time
like that with my family.

504
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,208
Yeah. No, it's... it's been great.

505
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,567
You guys got big plans
for the Fourth, or...?

506
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,802
My kids got me running all over
town looking for fireworks.

507
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,169
No, I think we'll probably
stick close to home.

508
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,362
Well, listen, Daniel,
I'm really glad you came in.

509
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,090
I loved what you did
on the Bay Cities project.

510
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,520
- Thank you.
- All the other partners

511
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,286
are very supportive,
so I say we do it.

512
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,330
- Really?
- Really.

513
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,562
- What do you say?
- I... Yes!

514
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,324
- It's yours. All right?
- Fantastic.

515
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,528
- Absolutely. I'll be in touch, OK?
- Great.

516
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,727
- OK.
- Have a good Fourth.

517
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,127
Thank you very much.

518
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,846
Hello?

519
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,925
Hi.

520
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,171
I've got news.

521
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,002
- Me, too.
- I got it, Lace.

522
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,685
I got the job.

523
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,042
Are you serious, Daniel?

524
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,407
They want me to start on the 15th.

525
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,971
Daniel, that's... that's amazing!

526
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,564
Let's see if Karen and Mike
will take Sammy tonight.

527
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,530
Jesse can stay at the Ratners'.

528
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,604
We need to celebrate,
for a change.

529
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,885
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
What was your news?

530
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,604
Uh... nothing.
Let's celebrate.

531
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,650
Daniel?

532
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,765
Daniel?

533
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

534
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,601
Daniel?

535
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,290
Daniel?

536
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,328
Why aren't you answering me?

537
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,046
Daniel.

538
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,931
Daniel.

539
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Daniel, wake up. Daniel!
Wake up. Wake up.

540
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,965
Daniel.

541
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,803
What am I doing in the kitchen?

542
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,281
I found you in the backyard.

543
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,801
You don't remember
getting out of bed?

544
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,564
No.

545
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,529
That is so... weird.

546
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,206
It's more than weird.

547
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,647
I'm ready to tell you my news.

548
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,244
I lost six hours today.

549
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,124
I mean, the last thing I remember,

550
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,090
I was in the middle
of this walk-through.

551
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,166
The clients told Pete that they thought

552
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,322
I was having some kind of breakdown.

553
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,162
And I woke up in bed, and I had this.

554
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,930
Jesus, Lace.

555
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,250
Daniel, I've got to show you something.

556
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,400
So I started with the birds.

557
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,370
And the best they can
understand it is that

558
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,605
something is interfering
with the Earth's geomagnetic field,

559
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:56,169
and... and that's causing
the birds to veer off course.

560
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,840
Some people say that it has something
to do with the government,

561
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,965
that they're testing some kind of
super-secret weapons technology.

562
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,407
And other people...

563
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,251
think it's something else,
something...

564
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,324
not from here.

565
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,404
What does that mean, "not from here"?

566
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,480
Not from... this planet.

567
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,087
- Lacy.
- I know this is so hard to believe.

568
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,891
- Just trust me. I've been research...
- No, it's more than hard to believe.

569
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,850
I mean... aliens?

570
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,171
That's...

571
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,487
That's insane. Right?

572
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,887
You know this is the reason
we don't self-diagnose on the Internet.

573
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,201
Stop. Hear me out on this.

574
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,761
There are people
who have reported experiencing

575
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,002
the same things
that we have been experiencing,

576
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,891
in these communities where these
other bird deaths have taken place.

577
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,970
This picture was drawn
by a five-year-old

578
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,727
in Chesapeake Bay in 2007,
shortly before he vanished.

579
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,689
Vanished, Daniel.

580
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,286
His family claims
he was taken by aliens

581
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,286
and that they had been
entering their home for weeks.

582
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,449
Sam drew this yesterday.

583
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,808
Yeah, well, maybe Sammy saw
this drawing online and copied it.

584
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,570
And maybe he made
800 birds hit our house?

585
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,049
I found a guy in the city who claims
to be an expert on this stuff.

586
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,323
- I think we gotta go talk to him. Yes.
- No. No, no, no, no.

587
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,767
Well, what other explanation
do you have?

588
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,242
Just because I can't explain something,
doesn't mean aliens are responsible.

589
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,687
Why can't you understand that
some things defy normal explanations?

590
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,120
We're not those people
who believe in crazy things!

591
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,964
Maybe those people
aren't the crazy ones!

592
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,600
- Who are you? Who...
- Don't do this.

593
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,761
- Where is my wife?
- Don't do that!

594
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,967
- You always...
- My sane wife!

595
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,360
Crazy stuff is happening right now!

596
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,682
Stop it! I'm not saying
nothing is going on.

597
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,241
But this, this is...
this is too much.

598
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,128
There's got to be another answer.

599
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,087
Right there.

600
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,841
You can go. Go ahead.

601
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,731
- Jump in.
- Cannonball!

602
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,045
Hey, shirt off, string bean.

603
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,123
Can't swim with your clothes on.

604
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,001
Come on, dork,
I know you want to swim.

605
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,641
Sammy, come here.
Let me take a look at you.

606
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,570
Sammy, come here.

607
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,608
It's OK, baby.
I'm just gonna take a look, OK?

608
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,171
Put your arms up.

609
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,002
Sammy, tell me who did this to you.

610
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,364
Sammy, I need you to tell me
who did this to you.

611
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,044
Hey, you know that girl Jennifer?

612
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,885
- Yeah.
- That bitch was on my jock.

613
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,644
- Really?
- Yeah.

614
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,370
What about you? You get any?

615
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,522
I saw you with Shelly.

616
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,762
Did you kiss her?

617
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,367
- Yeah.
- Did you feel her titties?

618
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,931
Kind of, I guess.

619
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,650
Shit, dawg!

620
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,370
That's nothing!

621
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,204
You got to go down-town.

622
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,964
That's what I do with all my ladies.

623
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,247
Hey, Barrett.

624
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,890
"Ow!"

625
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,884
- Dude, stop.
- Better run, bitch!

626
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,441
Stop being a dick! Stop!

627
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,724
I'm gonna pop a cap in your ass!

628
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,566
Man down!

629
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,448
Oh, come on,
it didn't hurt that bad, you pussy.

630
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,525
Jesse?

631
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,805
Jesse!

632
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,285
How is he?

633
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,442
Well, I didn't find
anything physically wrong with Jesse

634
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,170
that would cause a blackout or seizure.

635
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,845
And the MRI was clear.

636
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,241
So, as I said, I don't think
what we're dealing with here

637
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,129
is a neurological problem.

638
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,691
So what do you think it is?

639
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,209
Well, I believe this episode was
the result of some emotional trauma.

640
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,883
Now, I need you to listen to me
very carefully, Mr. and Mrs. Barrett.

641
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,762
During my examination, I found some
unusual marks on your son's body.

642
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,048
What... I'm sorry.
What kind of marks?

643
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,966
Well, they look like
small geometric shapes.

644
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,248
Uh, squares, rectangles, circles.

645
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,011
But the troubling part is

646
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,721
that they appear to have been
applied with a brand.

647
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,926
Now, Mr. and Mrs. Barrett,

648
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,924
it's my opinion
that he did not do this to himself.

649
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,724
Jesse says he doesn't know
how he got them.

650
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,770
Do you have any idea
how he got them?

651
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,530
Uh, no.

652
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,728
Well, I have to inform you
that because of his age,

653
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,723
I'm required to refer this information

654
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,565
to Child Protective Services
for further investigation.

655
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,121
This is standard procedure.

656
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,090
They're gonna follow up
with some questions.

657
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,409
Do you understand
what I've just told you?

658
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,211
Yes... Yes.

659
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,051
Now, Mr. Barrett, the incident report
says that Jesse was playing

660
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,124
in the woods with his friend
at the time of his blackout.

661
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,365
Yeah.
Uh, a boy named Kevin Ratner.

662
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,210
He's a few years older than Jesse.

663
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,611
Well, do you have any reason
to believe that your son

664
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,651
and this boy
were into anything strange?

665
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,641
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Daniel, stop!

666
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,609
- Daniel, stop right now.
- Hey, Mr. Barrett.

667
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,410
- Jesse, are you OK? What?
- What'd you do to my son?

668
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,291
- Stop, Daniel!
- Huh? What did you do?

669
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,241
- Nothing! What the fuck?
- Stop it right now!

670
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,845
Tell me, you little freak!
He's only 13 years old!

671
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,367
- He didn't do anything!
- Hey!

672
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,329
Daniel! Whoa, whoa!

673
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,166
- You guys, stop it!
- Ask your son what he did!

674
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,561
There's something wrong
with you people!

675
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,530
Just leave it on. You have to.

676
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,044
Jesse.

677
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,810
- Hey...
- Leave me alone.

678
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,169
Hi.

679
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,324
Don't touch me!

680
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,366
Tomorrow, we're gonna get a call
from Child Protective Services.

681
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,842
My best friend just
treated me like a criminal.

682
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,405
- Lacy...
- Karen said that Sammy

683
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,449
told her the Sandman did this.

684
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,331
You realize who she thinks
the Sandman is, right?

685
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,130
- I know.
- Did you do this?

686
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,090
- Did you put your hands on our son?!
- Jesus Christ!

687
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,005
Something is hurting our children,
Daniel, and you're too stubborn

688
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,083
- to believe what it is!
- I'm not listening to this shit!

689
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,526
Then tell me who did it!
Tell me.

690
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,210
Because it's not just
happening in their heads!

691
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,328
I don't know!

692
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,321
But when I find out,
I'm gonna deal with it.

693
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,560
Yeah, you really dealt
with things today, all right.

694
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,931
Daniel the hero!

695
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Wake up, Sammy.
Sammy. Wake up.

696
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,409
What's wrong, Daddy?

697
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,444
Oh, shit.

698
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,729
Come on, come on, come on.

699
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,371
What is it?

700
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,089
Do you remember right after Jesse
was born, and he was so sick?

701
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,847
The doctors didn't know what it was,
and they told us all we could do

702
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,361
was wait until morning
to see if he was gonna be OK.

703
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,806
That was the longest
night of my life.

704
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:33,206
I just felt... too helpless.

705
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,801
I didn't know if I was
gonna be kissing a child

706
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,968
or burying one in the morning.

707
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,050
It took me most of the night,

708
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,208
but I finally realized
something that allowed me

709
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:51,250
to watch the sun
come up without fear.

710
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:57,527
However it all turned out,
no matter what I had to face...

711
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,329
I knew I would get through it,
because I had you.

712
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,289
I'm ready to believe.

713
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,444
Mr. Pollard?

714
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,165
Yes.

715
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,006
I'm sorry.

716
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,640
I had to run to the store.

717
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,925
That's OK. Um, I'm Lacy,
and this is my husband, Daniel.

718
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,284
You said on the phone
you have two children.

719
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,526
Yes, I...

720
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,365
We were just thinking
that it was better maybe

721
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,091
if we met you first, and then...

722
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,961
- Thank you.
- Have a seat in the living room.

723
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,090
I'll, uh, put on some tea.

724
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,650
Of course
he would have cats.

725
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,041
Cats don't
seem to care about them.

726
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,849
I used to live
in the suburbs, but...

727
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,041
the dogs always barked at night
when they came around.

728
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,965
Dogs have a sense for them.

729
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,528
Kept me up at night, so, uh...

730
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:31,291
so I moved here to a building
that doesn't allow dogs.

731
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,206
Helps me sleep
a little better at night.

732
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,568
I don't fight them any more.

733
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,290
Them?

734
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,764
The Grays.
That's what they're called.

735
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,769
They, uh“.

736
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:59,289
There are three generally
accepted kinds of aliens:

737
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,970
the Grays, lnsectoids
and the Reptilians.

738
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:10,001
But nine times out of ten, what people
report seeing are the Grays.

739
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:14,404
In fact, I'm... I'm dubious
about the other two altogether.

740
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,449
Especially the Reptilians.

741
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,524
I don't think
those accounts are credible.

742
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:24,129
Yeah.
That would make anyone sceptical.

743
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,048
I'm sorry, uh...
I'm getting ahead of myself.

744
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:38,445
The... the first thing we need to do
is determine whether or not

745
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,486
you actually are
experiencing an encounter.

746
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,966
Is-is that a test?

747
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,886
Uh, just a series of questions.

748
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,441
Helps weed out the lunatics.

749
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,083
Well, good. Let's do it.

750
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,641
OK.

751
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,201
Have either of you seen
any bright lights in the sky

752
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,045
above your neighbourhood
that moved in an unusual way?

753
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,168
No.

754
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:14,321
Have you experienced any
severe headaches or migraines?

755
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,364
Nope.

756
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,681
Either of you heard
a ringing in your ears

757
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:26,003
that seems to be happening
only inside your head?

758
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,289
Yes.

759
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,251
Have you experienced
any unexplained illnesses,

760
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,880
strange allergies or nosebleeds?

761
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,407
- Yes.
- Yes.

762
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:49,441
Have you witnessed any abnormal behaviour
by animals in your neighbourhood?

763
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,560
Three different flocks of birds
flew into our house the other day.

764
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,681
I would say that qualifies.

765
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,650
Have either of you
experienced any blackouts,

766
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,009
stretches of time
that you can't account for?

767
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,329
And have you experienced a feeling

768
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:18,082
that you might not be
in control of your own body?

769
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,089
How do you know all this?

770
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,680
You are not alone in this.

771
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,207
Others have experienced
what you're going through

772
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:34,524
and have struggled
the way you're struggling now.

773
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,685
Why are the Grays, or whatever they are,
so interested in us?

774
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,565
What makes us so special?

775
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,842
Nothing.

776
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,241
There's nothing special about you.

777
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,126
I'm sorry.

778
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,966
You were hoping
for a different answer.

779
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,045
But this is beyond
our comprehension.

780
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,249
What answer would a lab rat
understand from a scientist

781
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,883
in a white coat putting electrodes
in its brain, giving it cancer?

782
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,691
I've interviewed
literally thousands of people

783
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,764
who claim to have been
visited by the Grays.

784
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,884
They come from all walks of life.

785
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,965
The only thing they have in common

786
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:25,409
is that their lives have
become a living hell because of it.

787
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,570
People think of aliens
as these beings

788
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:32,610
invading our planet
in some great cataclysm,

789
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:38,563
destroying monuments,
stealing our natural resources.

790
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,927
But it's not like that at all.

791
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,289
The invasion... already happened.

792
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:53,522
No one knows exactly when, but...

793
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,407
they're here.

794
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,361
They've been here.

795
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:06,204
The presence of the Grays
is now a fact of life.

796
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,806
Like death and taxes.

797
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,241
Do you know what they want?

798
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,165
They seem to be...

799
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,450
studying us, experimenting on us.

800
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,367
One thing we know for sure is,
they use our fears against us.

801
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:30,047
It can start like a...
a childish prank...

802
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:36,331
a mess in the kitchen
or things missing in the house.

803
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,927
And before you know it, you're walking
through a full-blown nightmare.

804
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,287
You probably already have implants.

805
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:47,091
Implants?

806
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,084
That's how they control you.

807
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,607
Make you do things
you can't remember,

808
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,604
make you see things
that aren't there.

809
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,649
Shall we have a look?

810
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,371
He has...

811
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,246
Let me see.

812
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,241
Yeah, there she is.

813
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,767
This one didn't take as well.

814
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,800
Skin's pretty irritated,
that happens sometimes.

815
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,003
It's a... it's a rash or a bite.

816
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,049
That's what they want you to think.

817
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,925
The Grays...

818
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,810
hide what they do.

819
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:31,521
Disguise the implants
as something perfectly normal.

820
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,602
Most people don't even
know they have them.

821
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,289
Well, can we remove it?

822
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,281
No.

823
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,848
No. Believe me, I've tried.

824
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,884
Oh, my God.

825
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:57,648
Every time I think I'm getting it,
it seems to burrow in deeper.

826
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,449
We'll move. Pack everything
in the car and just drive away.

827
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,006
These beings almost certainly

828
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:17,563
came millions of light-years
to get here.

829
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,643
Do you really think
moving to the next town

830
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,407
or checking into a motel
will stop them from finding you?

831
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,646
The events you've been experiencing,

832
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,804
the disturbances in your home,
the blackouts,

833
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,645
the marks on your bodies...

834
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,610
they are not the beginning
of something, Daniel.

835
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,364
They are the end of something.

836
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,281
It's like a countdown.

837
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,081
The Grays will watch a family
for a long time

838
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,527
before they reveal themselves.

839
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:56,601
But once they do, it means they're
getting ready to take someone.

840
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,402
What are you talking about?

841
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,285
This is important.

842
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:07,046
Which member of your family did
the Grays first make contact with?

843
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,644
My youngest son, Sam.

844
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,723
Then Sam is in the most danger.

845
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,889
The Grays almost always abduct

846
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,247
the first family member
they showed an interest in.

847
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,611
So that's it?

848
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,127
- We just wait until they take our son?
- No.

849
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,890
You fight them
with everything you've got.

850
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,806
Your only hope is
to make it so difficult for them,

851
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:37,123
that they simply move on
to someone else.

852
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,886
Wait-wait-wait-wait, I'm sor...

853
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,041
That can work?

854
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,644
It has before, in some cases.

855
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,486
Yes. I've even heard of cases
where someone who's been taken

856
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,531
has eventually returned,
but you can't count on it.

857
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:56,366
Everything the Grays do is intended
to divide us from one another,

858
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,251
to isolate the one they've chosen.

859
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:04,804
Your greatest defence against them
is if your family is unified.

860
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,446
But you have to act quickly.
There isn't much time.

861
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,440
Protect your family, Mr. Barrett.

862
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,086
We'll go to the police.
We'll show them the surveillance video.

863
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,607
And say what, "We think aliens
have come into our house",

864
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,525
implanted some probes we can't see"?
The police will think we're crazy, Lace.

865
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,091
- Hell, I think we're crazy.
- They have to believe us.

866
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,571
- It's the truth!
- You realize what will happen

867
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,245
if we do that?
They won't just not believe us.

868
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,681
They'll take Jesse and Sam.

869
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,049
They'll say we're unfit to be parents.
Everybody's already suspicious.

870
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,651
We have to do something.
You heard what he said!

871
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,325
This only goes one way!

872
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,521
I mean, you've got your Remington .17,

873
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,081
uh, your Ruger .204...

874
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,402
uh, then there's
a Winchester .243 A-Bolt,

875
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,166
if you're looking to go
with a higher calibre. Uh...

876
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:58,530
I need something that packs
a lot of punch at close range.

877
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,800
What kind of hunting
you say you're doing?

878
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,321
Morn, what's going on?

879
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,090
Why are we getting a dog?
I thought Dad was allergic.

880
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,607
Dad can take medicine, and dogs
are good to have around the house.

881
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,683
- It's for protection, isn't it?
- We'll talk about it later.

882
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,365
- I want to talk about it now.
- What about this one?

883
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,044
Yeah.

884
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,681
- Hey, pal.
- You're boarding up the windows?

885
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,649
We're keeping out the Sandman.

886
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,610
- Where's the dog?
- In a room in back with Mom.

887
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,211
We got a dog?

888
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,005
You want to give me a hand?
I could use some help.

889
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,447
No. This is bullshit!

890
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,090
Hey, Jesse, come on.

891
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,283
Jesse, stop!

892
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,209
- Let's talk about it.
- Talk about what?

893
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,091
How you beat up my best friend?
How everyone thinks we're freaks?

894
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,730
You've ruined everything.

895
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,041
Come... come inside.
Let me explain.

896
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,168
There's nothing to explain.

897
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,488
You can't keep treating me
like a little kid.

898
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,120
You can lie to Sammy,
but you can't lie to me.

899
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,648
Jesse!

900
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,931
I hear your dad's boarding up
all the windows.

901
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,290
What's he trying to keep out?

902
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,931
I think I know, but...

903
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:43,290
if I told you, you'd probably
think I'm crazy like him.

904
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,845
Look, I've known your dad
since I was four.

905
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,930
And he's always been
totally weird, but...

906
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,689
I don't think he's crazy.

907
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:15,010
If the Sandman comes
to talk to you tonight,

908
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:18,642
I want you to promise me
you won't listen to him

909
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,441
or do anything that he says, all right?

910
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:27,524
- I promise.
- OK.

911
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:32,322
Maybe if I just gave him my eyes,
he would leave us alone.

912
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,811
No, baby, you can't.

913
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,128
The Sandman is never satisfied.

914
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,282
So we can't give him anything.

915
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:41,046
That's the only way
we can make him go away.

916
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,648
Something's coming, isn't it?

917
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,086
Tonight?

918
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,201
Maybe.

919
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,010
I don't know.

920
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,925
But we've got to be prepared.

921
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,730
Do you think it's gonna hurt us?

922
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,641
That's what your morn and I are
gonna make sure doesn't happen.

923
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,283
Why don't you just call the police?

924
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,642
They wouldn't understand.

925
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,086
It's up to us.

926
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,923
Look, whatever happens tonight...

927
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,281
don't let your brother
out of your sight, OK?

928
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,691
I won't.

929
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,282
Do you guys want to watch fireworks?

930
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:25,326
How? We're stuck inside.

931
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,086
We can watch them on TV.

932
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,404
<i>...savory beef
grilled to perfection.</i>

933
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:38,040
<i>And with just the right
of Mr. Sunshine...</i>

934
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:24,926
Sammy, do you remember
your first big Fourth of July,

935
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:28,448
when we went up to visit Aunt Maureen
and Uncle John in San Francisco?

936
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,331
When we went on the boat?

937
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,802
That's right, Uncle John's boat.

938
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,170
And do you remember
what you said the fireworks looked like?

939
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,006
Ice cream?

940
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,487
That's right.

941
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:47,529
Ice cream.

942
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,410
What about you, Jess? You remember
your first big Fourth of July?

943
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,923
We were at the old house.

944
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:08,530
And you and Mom woke me up.

945
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,842
And you put me on your shoulders,

946
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,480
and you carried me
to the top of White's Hill.

947
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:16,206
And do you remember
what you said when we got there?

948
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,645
I said I wanted to go home.

949
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,845
Yeah.

950
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,843
I carried you all the way up there

951
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,686
to see your first big fireworks,
and you couldn't care less.

952
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,241
Lacy, take the boys upstairs.

953
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,290
No. We need to stick together.

954
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,602
No, no. We need to stick together.

955
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,922
- Jesse, upstairs now.
- Dad. Come on...

956
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,491
Jesse, now.

957
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,769
- Lock yourself in Jesse's room.
- Go, go, go, go!

958
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,723
Don't open this door
under any circumstance, OK?

959
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,281
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Baby, I'm going to be right out here.

960
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,408
- I'm going to be right outside.
- Mommy!

961
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:22,925
Come on.

962
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

963
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

964
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,847
Daniel! Daniel!

965
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,804
Daniel!

966
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:37,291
Leave us alone!

967
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,565
- Come on!
- OK.

968
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:08,724
Daniel! Daniel!

969
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,089
Daniel!

970
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,447
Stand back! Back! Back!

971
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,049
In! In!

972
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:18,326
Sammy. Sammy!

973
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,802
GO, 901

974
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

975
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,809
Mommy!

976
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,450
Sammy, no!

977
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,006
Sam?

978
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,809
You were right.
I ruined everything.

979
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,606
No!

980
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,681
Sammy.

981
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,406
Sammy!

982
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,723
<i>You've been a bad girl.</i>

983
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,087
<i>I guess you'd better punish me.</i>

984
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,931
<i>That feels so good.</i>

985
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,929
Watch with us, Jesse.

986
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,650
Sammy?

987
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,326
Sammy?

988
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,010
Sam...

989
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,604
Jesse!

990
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,931
<i>No! No!</i>

991
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,043
Right. Yeah.

992
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,202
No, I... I know
they don't believe us,

993
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,089
but, Marty, you're... you're...
you're our lawyer.

994
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:06,527
I need you to at least
act like you believe us.

995
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,764
Yeah.

996
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,968
So, when's the next court date?

997
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,411
Uh-huh.

998
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,011
Hey, brought up some more toys.

999
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:53,171
Have you experienced
any unexplained illnesses,

1000
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:56,125
strange allergies or nosebleeds?

1001
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:59,210
Do you remember right after Jesse
was born and he was so sick,

1002
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,010
and the doctors
didn't know what it was?

1003
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,647
My, uh, oldest, Jesse, was sick
all the time when he was little.

1004
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,724
<i>It was like he was allergic
to the entire world.</i>

1005
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:43,251
Command Control?

1006
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,969
<i>Sam!</i>

1007
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,244
<i>Sammy!</i>
