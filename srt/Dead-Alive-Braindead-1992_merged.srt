1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've got the vibes.

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,490
This thing is evil,
Man.

3
00:00:27,535 --> 00:00:29,867
I got a bad feeling.

4
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,565
Shut up and keep moving.

5
00:00:31,606 --> 00:00:33,631
Is big mistake.

6
00:00:33,674 --> 00:00:34,470
Let it go, Man.

7
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:37,068
We set it down,
And we let it go.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's only a bloody monkey,
For christ's sake.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,992
Now pick it up.

10
00:00:50,938 --> 00:00:51,996
Listen,

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,695
You no pick up the cage,

12
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:56,966
You no get
The big dollars.

13
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:58,097
Ooh!
Grr!

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,573
Holy shit!

15
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:06,076
Don't move!

16
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:10,778
What are these buggers
Playing at?

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,628
He says that that monkey
Must be set free.

18
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:20,728
He says we must leave
This valley

19
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:21,533
And never return,

20
00:01:21,572 --> 00:01:24,905
Or the evil spirits
Will exact their revenge.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,728
Permit.

22
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:44,702
Look and see. Permit.

23
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:46,727
Permit!

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,627
I'm a new zealand
Zoo official,

25
00:01:56,669 --> 00:02:00,469
And this monkey is going
To new town.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,297
Oh! Aah! Aah!

27
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:07,842
No.

28
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:10,326
No!

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,991
Move it!

30
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:36,780
Start her up! Quick!

31
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,693
Hey!

32
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:48,929
Wait!

33
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,962
Drive, You buggers!

34
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,539
Ow!

35
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,632
Man, Wait.

36
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:55,870
Step on it!

37
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:14,918
The little bugger bit me.

38
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:16,794
Zingaya.

39
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:18,822
Zingaya!

40
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,370
You've got the bite.

41
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:32,403
There's... There's some
Dettol in the jeep.

42
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:35,906
Aw, Jeez! No!

43
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:39,312
No! What are you doing?!

44
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,385
Zingaya.

45
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,428
Oh, Jee... Oh!

46
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:56,360
Zingaya!

47
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,797
Thank you.

48
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:18,137
HI, Paquita.

49
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:22,167
Good morning, Roger.

50
00:06:24,814 --> 00:06:26,076
That's the lot.

51
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,481
Tell your dad I'll be
Round on thursday

52
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:31,510
With the saveloys.

53
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:39,251
That's a pretty dress,
Paquita.

54
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:46,425
See you later,
Alligator.

55
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:54,766
You like that boy,
Paquita?

56
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,992
Shuffle the cards.

57
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:06,876
We will see
If you and roger

58
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,777
Are destined
To be together.

59
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:13,000
Create his image
In your mind

60
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,901
And cut the cards.

61
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:16,493
Paquita,

62
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,300
I thought we'd seen
The last of this.

63
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:23,332
Whenever he come,
You start over again.

64
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,524
This...

65
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:27,559
Is you.

66
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:32,000
And this...

67
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Is the man
Of your future.

68
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But he doesn't look
Like roger.

69
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,992
It is not roger.

70
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
There will be
One romance,

71
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:50,736
And it shall last
Forever.

72
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:52,000
Romance. Puh.

73
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What about money?

74
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,557
This man will enter
Your life...

75
00:07:56,557 --> 00:07:58,535
In the near future.

76
00:07:58,572 --> 00:08:01,234
And you will become...

77
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:04,244
Romantically entangled
With him

78
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:06,000
Almost immediately.

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But who is it?

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You will recognize
This man...

81
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
By the symbol...

82
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,059
Of the star...

83
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:18,094
And of the moon.

84
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:21,171
What is this?

85
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,675
Oh! No, Not that one.

86
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,540
Paquita,
We have a customer.

87
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:31,081
It is bad, Yes?

88
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:32,676
Oh, Nothing.

89
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,710
Paquita!

90
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:54,230
Uh, Just dropping off
Our order.

91
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:01,145
Mum says to pack
The biscuits on top,

92
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:04,947
Because she doesn't
Want any broken.

93
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:07,215
Uh, Actually...

94
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:11,247
I'll take
One of these now.

95
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,695
Sorry.

96
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,992
Santa maria.

97
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:37,872
I better be off,
Then.

98
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,992
Woman: Lionel!

99
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,991
Lionel!

100
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,764
Woman on radio:
Good morning, Everybody.

101
00:10:13,804 --> 00:10:16,295
Morning, Everybody.
Well, Now I'd like...

102
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,967
There's a beetle.

103
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:18,634
Eh?

104
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:21,000
There. Under the fridge.

105
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,833
Horrid little creature
Scuttled right in front of me.

106
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:25,962
I thought I told you
To spray this house!

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,332
The place is infested
With vermin.

108
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll get on it
Straight away, Mum.

109
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,991
Lionel!

110
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,000
You'll be pleased
To know

111
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,458
That your mother has been
Voted treasurer elect

112
00:10:41,503 --> 00:10:43,664
Of the w.L.W. L...

113
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:47,039
The wellington ladies
Welfare league.

114
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:48,873
Ah, That's great, Mum.

115
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:50,000
And on friday,

116
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,331
The president
Nora matheson

117
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:54,000
Is dropping by to offer
Her congratulations.

118
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Wow. The president.

119
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,365
Oh, God!

120
00:10:58,402 --> 00:11:03,339
Look at the state
Of this place!

121
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:06,274
All the windows
Will have to be polished.

122
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,301
Woman on radio: Whiter,
Brighter, Cleaner wash.

123
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:09,778
Look at this dust!

124
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:11,371
It's an inch thick!

125
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:13,178
You'll have to do
The silver.

126
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,582
I polished it
Last week.

127
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:17,314
And the drapes
Need cleaning.

128
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:19,584
Woman on radio:
Once a week, Once a month...

129
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:20,917
I just mowed
The lawn.

130
00:11:20,957 --> 00:11:23,687
Does this look like
A well-Maintained frontage?

131
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:25,718
Woman on radio: Very often
After drying the dishes...

132
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:42,633
Get up,
You stupid dog.

133
00:11:42,674 --> 00:11:44,369
Here,
I'll help you.

134
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:46,343
No. I manage.

135
00:11:46,378 --> 00:11:50,000
Your brother usually does
The deliveries.

136
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,992
Not today.

137
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,992
Ohh. Is big house.

138
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:08,300
You live here always?

139
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,170
Yeah.

140
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,763
You like my dog?

141
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:14,667
Is very big, Yes?

142
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:18,000
Any bigger,
And he'd belong in a zoo.

143
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,967
Zoo? Pardon?

144
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:20,468
Zoo. You know.

145
00:12:20,502 --> 00:12:22,000
Uh... Animals.

146
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,989
Cages.

147
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:25,369
Claro.

148
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:28,372
I like to go with zoo.

149
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:30,670
I go with the zoo?

150
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,040
Oh, No. No, No.

151
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:34,705
You want to go
To the zoo.

152
00:12:34,746 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes, Please.

153
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,828
Oh, Ok.

154
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:43,862
Tomorrow?

155
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:50,807
I'll meet you outside
The shop.

156
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:52,838
Ok.

157
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,992
I have to go.

158
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,934
My jardiniere.
It's shattered.

159
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:11,664
Ah, Mum,
That was your favorite.

160
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:14,172
It wouldn't have happened
If you'd dusted carefully.

161
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:16,106
I can get you another one.

162
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:17,000
It's irreplaceable.

163
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,968
A present
From your father.

164
00:13:19,002 --> 00:13:21,197
Our last
Wedding anniversary.

165
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:22,465
Before...

166
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:26,305
He was taken from us.

167
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:32,239
I miss him, Too.

168
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:58,958
Look.

169
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,468
Cary grant.
He is such a dream.

170
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,736
I wish I could be
Grace kelly.

171
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:06,538
She is so pretty.

172
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:10,570
Such beautiful
Blond hair.

173
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,991
Lionel?

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,992
What is wrong?

175
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,534
Uh, Sorry.

176
00:14:31,842 --> 00:14:34,333
When I was young,
I was at the beach,

177
00:14:34,378 --> 00:14:35,538
And I...

178
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:36,978
I nearly drowned

179
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
When I fell off
This pier.

180
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,959
Uh, My dad dived in
To save me, But...

181
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,969
As he was climbing out,
This...

182
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Freak wave just...

183
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Washed him out to sea,
And...

184
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,992
He drowned.

185
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,467
Oh, The little monkeys!

186
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:08,493
Look, Lionel.

187
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,992
There! For you!

188
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,992
Poor little bugger.

189
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,996
You get out of there,
You vicious little shit!

190
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:33,008
Reckon they're only found
On one island, You know?

191
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:36,000
Story goes,
These great big rats...

192
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Come scuttling off
The slave ships...

193
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And raped all
The little tree monkeys.

194
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,466
You know,

195
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,000
The natives use them
In black magic rituals.

196
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,024
Really?

197
00:16:49,068 --> 00:16:50,296
Yeah.

198
00:16:50,336 --> 00:16:51,166
Don't ask me how.

199
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:55,231
Probably suck the blood
Of virgins, Eh? Eh?

200
00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:58,266
I want to sit down.

201
00:17:57,497 --> 00:17:59,055
Holy shit!

202
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:00,725
Look at this.
It bit me.

203
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,291
I've been savaged.

204
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:04,860
And my dress.

205
00:18:04,904 --> 00:18:07,168
Here. I help you.

206
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:12,568
Lionel...

207
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:15,704
Take me home.

208
00:18:31,497 --> 00:18:33,692
There you are, Vera.

209
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:36,497
Now you just rest up.

210
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:38,590
I'll be back
In a couple of days

211
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:40,099
To change
That dressing.

212
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:41,260
Thanks,
Nurse mctavish.

213
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:42,564
It's all right,
Lionel.

214
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:46,000
I'll see myself out.

215
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:18,794
Why have you
Deliberately

216
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:22,497
Gone out of your way
To upset me?

217
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:25,489
I'm sorry.

218
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:30,490
It won't happen again.

219
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:46,274
I don't deserve
All this attention, Darling.

220
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:48,410
If you need anything
During the night,

221
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:49,612
You just call.

222
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:51,712
You're so good to me.

223
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,747
Good night, Mum.

224
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,991
Lionel!

225
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,991
Hello!

226
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:19,827
Keep your voice down.

227
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:21,734
Look.
I have your jacket.

228
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:23,830
Yeah.
I'll get it tomorrow.

229
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:25,864
What?

230
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:28,767
Look.

231
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:49,421
It could've waited
Till the morning.

232
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:52,000
Is that all
You have to say?

233
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:55,000
Look, I'm really sorry
About the zoo, Paquita.

234
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,499
It's just mum.

235
00:20:57,534 --> 00:20:58,796
She's...

236
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:00,564
You know.

237
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:03,090
I'd like to...

238
00:21:00,604 --> 00:21:02,936
We go out again?

239
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:04,270
To a movie?

240
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:11,000
But it's not...
It's just not possible.

241
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:05,569
Look...

242
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,989
Not possible?

243
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:15,935
But we are romantically
Entangled.

244
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,437
Entangled?

245
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:18,905
Oh, Look...

246
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,465
Look, I don't know
What you're thinking,

247
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:23,101
But, Um...

248
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:27,137
I just can't see you
Anymore.

249
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:45,489
Oh, Paquita.

250
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,662
There will be
One romance...

251
00:22:01,702 --> 00:22:05,695
And it shall last
Forever.

252
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,333
Mum, What a beautiful day.

253
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:32,829
I'm gonna call
Nurse mctavish.

254
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:34,993
No. You'll do
No such thing.

255
00:23:35,035 --> 00:23:37,503
I'm perfectly
All right.

256
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:39,529
But...

257
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:44,100
You look after me,
Lionel.

258
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Nora matheson.

259
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,799
Ladies welfare league.

260
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,993
Your mother's
Expecting us.

261
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:04,839
The mathesons are here.

262
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,610
No, Mum.
You're not well!

263
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:13,639
Get my dress!

264
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,855
Jeez.

265
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:22,586
Please go back to bed,
Mum.

266
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:24,890
I'll put them off.
It's only the mathesons.

267
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:27,920
It's the w.L.W.L.

268
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:37,671
Sorry.

269
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:46,205
Careful.
It'll stick on crooked.

270
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:47,944
Ok.

271
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,092
Our...

272
00:24:55,135 --> 00:24:57,330
Main objective
Next year,

273
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,598
Is to...

274
00:24:58,638 --> 00:25:01,129
Get the younger
Generation

275
00:25:01,174 --> 00:25:02,607
Involved
In the league.

276
00:25:02,642 --> 00:25:04,303
That's why
I'm so pleased

277
00:25:04,344 --> 00:25:08,474
That you're on
The committee.

278
00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:11,507
Thank you, Nora.

279
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:15,744
It's a great... Honor.

280
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
H- Have you had
Any thoughts

281
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
On the agenda for
The annual meeting?

282
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,992
Annual meeting.

283
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,992
Annual meeting.

284
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,991
Ann...

285
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,627
Ann...

286
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:39,965
What we need's
Another war!

287
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,992
Yes, Dear.

288
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,093
I hear
Sir Edmund Hillary's

289
00:25:46,135 --> 00:25:50,367
Planning an attempt
On the south pole.

290
00:25:50,406 --> 00:25:51,566
Right you go.

291
00:25:51,608 --> 00:25:56,602
Have some more beans,
Mrs. Matheson.

292
00:25:56,946 --> 00:25:58,073
I'll have
A few of those, Lad.

293
00:25:58,073 --> 00:26:00,564
I really think
We should be going.

294
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:03,000
Thank you, Lionel.

295
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,160
What?

296
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,156
No pudding?

297
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,247
Only custard,
I'm afraid.

298
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:09,247
Custard!

299
00:26:09,247 --> 00:26:12,188
I haven't had
A good custard in years.

300
00:26:12,188 --> 00:26:16,000
She never
Makes the stuff.

301
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:30,629
Damn fine custard.

302
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:36,679
Mmm.

303
00:26:36,713 --> 00:26:42,709
Rich and creamy,
Just the way I like it.

304
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Touchy on
The old food front, Eh?

305
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Never mind.

306
00:27:09,201 --> 00:27:12,170
That was
A fine meal, Boy.

307
00:27:12,204 --> 00:27:16,197
Thank you,
Mr. Matheson.

308
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,365
Lionel!

309
00:28:01,402 --> 00:28:02,232
What's wrong?

310
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:05,727
Lionel,
You must listen to me.

311
00:28:05,773 --> 00:28:10,767
Dark forces are amassing
Against you.

312
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,934
My grandmama has seen it.

313
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:17,735
Say, "The path ahead
Is one of fear

314
00:28:17,772 --> 00:28:19,933
And great danger."

315
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:21,135
Eh?

316
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,991
Fernando!

317
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,612
Paquita, Wait!

318
00:28:32,358 --> 00:28:34,349
God, Mum.

319
00:28:51,377 --> 00:28:53,620
Oh, Fernando.

320
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Your mother ate my dog!

321
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,992
Not all of it.

322
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,993
Get nurse McTavish, Quick.

323
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:41,636
How long has your mother
Been like this?

324
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,000
Since this morning.

325
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,662
Oh. I'll call
An ambulance.

326
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:50,000
You pack some things
For the hospital.

327
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,867
I'll do it.

328
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,992
Nurse McTavish.

329
00:30:18,514 --> 00:30:22,507
Your mother's dead,
Lionel.

330
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,093
I'm sorry, Lionel.

331
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:40,000
There was nothing
We could do.

332
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,265
She loved you very much.

333
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

334
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,992
Which toothbrush?

335
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,932
Lionel!

336
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:33,435
Your mother's
Toothbrush...

337
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:36,927
The white one
Or green one?

338
00:31:36,973 --> 00:31:38,964
Green!

339
00:31:45,748 --> 00:31:47,147
Man on radio: Mother.

340
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:48,650
You are looking well today.

341
00:31:48,685 --> 00:31:50,619
Woman on radio:
I woke up this morning,

342
00:31:53,356 --> 00:31:55,347
How about
A nice cup of tea?

343
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:58,849
I'll just put the jug on.

344
00:31:58,895 --> 00:32:03,000
Sorry, Mother. That
Was your favorite teapot.

345
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It slipped
Out of me hand.

346
00:32:05,203 --> 00:32:08,195
Never mind that.

347
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Jacket,
Nightgown, Slippers,

348
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,992
And toothbrush.

349
00:32:55,705 --> 00:32:57,468
Where's your mother?

350
00:32:57,507 --> 00:32:59,566
She's gone to hospital.

351
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:02,509
I didn't hear
The ambulance.

352
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:03,978
No, No.

353
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:07,548
No

354
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,000
She went
In nurse McTavish's car.

355
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,059
Sort of, Uh, Well,

356
00:33:12,102 --> 00:33:14,468
Sort of Iying across
The back seat, Really.

357
00:33:14,505 --> 00:33:18,000
Yeah. Her and nurse McTavish.
Off to hospital.

358
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,467
But her night bag?

359
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:24,494
I'll take that.

360
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:31,908
Man on radio:
So, It's you

361
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:33,708
Who've been poaching
My rabbits.

362
00:33:33,747 --> 00:33:34,270
Lionel.

363
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:35,303
Man on radio:
I've a good mind

364
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:37,874
To let you have it
With both barrels.

365
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:39,146
Second man on radio:
It weren't me, Sir.

366
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:41,000
It were that johnny
Morris what did it.

367
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,659
Well, I go now.

368
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:43,999
Man on radio: You just be
On your way, Young lad.

369
00:33:44,036 --> 00:33:46,732
If I see you here again,

370
00:33:46,772 --> 00:33:50,765
I'll give you what for.

371
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,992
What do you want?

372
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:32,561
You're not
From the immigration?

373
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:34,470
I told you people

374
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:38,068
I lost
My bloody papers, Ok?

375
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:41,672
My family left Latvia

376
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:43,306
During the occupation.

377
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:46,876
We were hunted
Like dogs.

378
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:50,000
I just want to buy some...

379
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Sedatives.

380
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,595
What do you think I am,
A goddamn doctor?

381
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:58,630
I don't sell sedatives.

382
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:03,902
Tranquilizers,
I do have.

383
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,627
Do you want
A syringe,

384
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:39,661
Or are you
Going to sniff?

385
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

386
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Oh, Lionel,
I am happy to see you.

387
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,000
Tell me about these...

388
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,992
Dark forces.

389
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,492
Death surrounds him.

390
00:37:40,537 --> 00:37:42,835
There will be torment

391
00:37:42,873 --> 00:37:44,773
And suffering.

392
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,992
You are marked.

393
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:53,897
Lionel.

394
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,867
Lionel, If something
Is wrong, I can...

395
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:01,000
Nothing's wrong, Ok?

396
00:38:10,782 --> 00:38:15,000
It contains the power
Of the white light.

397
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It will protect you.

398
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,993
Keep it with you always.

399
00:38:26,842 --> 00:38:29,000
How is your mother?

400
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,659
Oh, Fine.

401
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,000
They want to keep her in
Hospital for a few more days.

402
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,993
She ran
Right in front of me.

403
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
They must have
Discharged her early.

404
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It was
A dreadful shock,

405
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,695
Losing vera
Like that.

406
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:20,000
Had lunch with her
Only last friday.

407
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,058
Picture of health.

408
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:24,000
That boy of hers,
Where is he?

409
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Fine lad.

410
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Lionel called half a dozen
Times in the last 2 days.

411
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,764
Very keen
To view the remains.

412
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:32,498
Of course,
I had to put him off.

413
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:34,096
It would have been
Far too distressing.

414
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,940
As it is, It's been a damn
Difficult embalming job.

415
00:39:37,977 --> 00:39:40,207
Oh, My god.
Excuse me.

416
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,833
I can tell
You're not a cosgrove.

417
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:04,000
You're far
Too good looking.

418
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,932
Pardon?

419
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:06,000
Les is the name.

420
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,992
I'm lionel's u...

421
00:40:10,905 --> 00:40:12,202
Lionel's uncle.

422
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,902
And who might you be?

423
00:40:14,943 --> 00:40:18,936
Paquita Maria Sanchez.

424
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:22,711
Latin, Eh?

425
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:24,082
Excuse me, Father.

426
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,211
I am looking
For lionel.

427
00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:25,810
I haven't seen him.

428
00:40:25,854 --> 00:40:27,185
And if he's not here
In 10 minutes,

429
00:40:27,222 --> 00:40:30,248
His mother will be delivered
Into the hands of the lord

430
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:33,000
In his absence.

431
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Mortician: You idiot.

432
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,127
I told you to stay in there.

433
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:11,165
The embalming machine
Should be turned off.

434
00:41:13,544 --> 00:41:16,536
Oh, Great!
Blowout!

435
00:41:23,988 --> 00:41:25,922
Mortician:
You're a half-Wit.

436
00:41:25,956 --> 00:41:27,000
This is coming
Off your wages.

437
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'll fix them up.

438
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,466
No, Leave it.

439
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
We've got to get the body
To the service.

440
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The theme of
Today's service

441
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:53,627
Is the sanctity
Of motherhood.

442
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:57,129
Vera cosgrove
Will be surely missed

443
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,939
By her friends
And grieving family,

444
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,571
For she was indeed
A fine woman,

445
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:08,000
And everything a boy
Could wish for in a mother.

446
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,550
Father mcgruder: Lionel...

447
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,750
Though deprived of his father
At an early age,

448
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:17,000
Was blessed with an abundance
Of mother love.

449
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Father mcgruder:
Though our dear ones depart,

450
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,525
They live on in our hearts
And memories

451
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:25,000
Until,
In the fullness of time,

452
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,231
We, Too, Depart
From this world...

453
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,434
Until we are reunited
Once again.

454
00:43:32,474 --> 00:43:36,274
A christian spirit
Is eternal.

455
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:42,307
Yea, Whosoever believeth
In the lord jesus christ

456
00:43:42,484 --> 00:43:45,476
Shall be...

457
00:43:49,391 --> 00:43:52,383
Resurrected.

458
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,695
Poor lionel.

459
00:44:08,735 --> 00:44:11,226
He was always dreadfully
Attached to his mother.

460
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:13,739
Well, I've seen some displays
Of grief in my day,

461
00:44:13,774 --> 00:44:17,767
But nothing
Quite like that.

462
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,025
Do you need anything?

463
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:24,060
I'm fine.

464
00:44:24,772 --> 00:44:26,740
I called
To see you yesterday,

465
00:44:26,774 --> 00:44:28,799
But you didn't
Answer the door.

466
00:44:28,842 --> 00:44:34,000
I just want to be left
Alone for a while, Ok?

467
00:44:35,249 --> 00:44:38,480
At least he's
Well provided for.

468
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:41,647
Yes, Well, The cosgroves
Were hardly paupers.

469
00:44:41,688 --> 00:44:45,000
He'll be the sole
Beneficiary.

470
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Hey, Guys.

471
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,992
Look what I found.

472
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:39,469
What are you doing
With this thing?

473
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:42,101
Digging up a few stiffs?

474
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,228
L...
Shut up!

475
00:46:03,268 --> 00:46:06,000
You know
What you are?

476
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,968
A bloody sicko.

477
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,992
Yeah, Mean talk.

478
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,992
Get his wallet.

479
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
That's my mother
You're pissing on.

480
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,025
It's a zombie!

481
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,991
Mom, No!

482
00:47:11,279 --> 00:47:16,273
What in God's name
Is going on here?

483
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:33,998
The devil is amongst us.

484
00:47:34,035 --> 00:47:36,000
Stay back, Boy.

485
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
This calls
For divine intervention.

486
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:41,995
Yaaaaaah!

487
00:47:49,981 --> 00:47:53,974
I kick ass for the lord!

488
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,992
There you are, Mum.

489
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,467
Void.

490
00:49:48,501 --> 00:49:51,493
Use the spoon.

491
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,934
Hey, Hey.

492
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:33,732
Cut that out.

493
00:50:35,939 --> 00:50:37,930
Shh.

494
00:50:46,783 --> 00:50:49,513
How's it going, Lionel?

495
00:50:49,553 --> 00:50:50,485
Uh...

496
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,000
Come on, Mate.

497
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,093
I'm dying for a slash.

498
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:55,468
I've got a urinary infection.

499
00:50:55,505 --> 00:50:57,996
Christ, What a stink.

500
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,365
Yeah. Dog
Must have crawled

501
00:50:59,401 --> 00:51:01,665
Under the house
And died.

502
00:51:02,037 --> 00:51:05,200
Can't have been easy for you
These past few weeks, Lionel,

503
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:09,233
What, With your mother gone.

504
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,262
Who's that, Uh,

505
00:51:18,301 --> 00:51:21,000
Little girl
You've been seeing?

506
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,092
What?

507
00:51:22,135 --> 00:51:24,797
You know,
The little latin number

508
00:51:24,837 --> 00:51:26,000
With the cute bum.

509
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,467
Paquita.

510
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:29,060
Oh, Yeah, Paquita.

511
00:51:29,103 --> 00:51:30,968
That's the one.

512
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,438
She's a bit of all right.

513
00:51:32,473 --> 00:51:35,374
Wouldn't mind her
Doing the growl on me.

514
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,991
So...

515
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,959
All this is coming
Your way, Eh?

516
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:49,972
Of course, Uh...

517
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,968
Your mother
Was always intending

518
00:51:52,002 --> 00:51:53,833
To leave me a bequest.

519
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:54,768
Oh.

520
00:51:54,805 --> 00:51:55,328
Oh, Yes.

521
00:51:55,372 --> 00:51:57,306
We talked about it
Many times.

522
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,968
It was a foregone
Conclusion, Really.

523
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:02,979
It's just, With her
Dying suddenly,

524
00:52:03,013 --> 00:52:06,471
She didn't get the chance
To include me in her will.

525
00:52:06,516 --> 00:52:08,609
Well, You'll have
To talk to the lawyers

526
00:52:08,652 --> 00:52:09,619
About it, Uncle les.

527
00:52:09,653 --> 00:52:12,884
Don't bring the bloody
Lawyers into it.

528
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,696
This is a private
Family matter.

529
00:52:15,536 --> 00:52:18,562
What the hell's that?

530
00:52:18,606 --> 00:52:21,166
It's the pipes.

531
00:52:21,209 --> 00:52:22,301
They do that sometimes.

532
00:52:22,343 --> 00:52:23,503
It's not the pipes,
Lionel.

533
00:52:23,544 --> 00:52:25,569
It's somebody
Doing the business.

534
00:52:25,613 --> 00:52:27,877
Please, Uncle les,
You just gotta leave.

535
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:33,912
So you found your dad's
Old stag movies, Eh?

536
00:52:33,955 --> 00:52:35,820
Yeah.

537
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,228
Is that the one
With the donkey

538
00:52:39,268 --> 00:52:40,360
And the chambermaid?

539
00:52:40,403 --> 00:52:42,303
No, Please.

540
00:52:42,338 --> 00:52:44,101
All right.

541
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,937
I understand,
Lionel.

542
00:52:45,975 --> 00:52:48,205
Some things
A man prefers

543
00:52:48,244 --> 00:52:49,472
To do on his own.

544
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:55,173
It's all part
Of the grieving process.

545
00:53:02,258 --> 00:53:06,251
Be seeing you, Lionel.

546
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,797
Man on radio: Nijinsky
Was of what nationality?

547
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:34,293
Second man on radio:
Nijinsky is russian.

548
00:53:34,338 --> 00:53:36,704
Russian is right.
That's very good.

549
00:53:36,741 --> 00:53:37,366
Um, 13.

550
00:53:37,408 --> 00:53:41,401
Number 13,
He's going for.

551
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,991
Lionel!

552
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,314
I dropped a shilling.

553
00:54:08,314 --> 00:54:10,000
It must have, Uh...

554
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,194
Rolled down the drain.

555
00:54:11,234 --> 00:54:12,394
I come to see you,

556
00:54:12,435 --> 00:54:14,062
You shut the door
In my face.

557
00:54:14,104 --> 00:54:15,264
You built a big wall.

558
00:54:15,305 --> 00:54:18,274
I telephone,
And you don't answer.

559
00:54:18,308 --> 00:54:19,138
Why?

560
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:21,905
Speak to me.

561
00:54:21,945 --> 00:54:25,642
You don't want
To see me anymore?

562
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:28,674
It was a mistake.

563
00:54:29,552 --> 00:54:31,543
Sorry.

564
00:54:32,555 --> 00:54:34,546
Good-Bye.

565
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,932
Paquita.

566
00:54:49,968 --> 00:54:51,000
Leave me alone.

567
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,092
I'm sorry.

568
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:53,534
Leave me alone.

569
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:58,564
Take your hands
Off her, You creep!

570
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:01,000
You know what they're saying
About you, Don't you?

571
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
You've gone funny
In the head.

572
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,833
A real bloody weirdo.

573
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:06,427
You touch her again,

574
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,371
And I'll knock you into
The middle of next week.

575
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,992
Hello. Hello.

576
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,163
How's cute little selwyn
There?

577
00:57:40,008 --> 00:57:43,000
Peekaboo.
Peekaboo.

578
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,992
So I said...

579
00:58:51,743 --> 00:58:53,734
Yeah!

580
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,992
Hyperactive.

581
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,865
So, I tackled
This guy, Right?

582
00:59:27,902 --> 00:59:29,995
I brought him down
This real bone cruncher.

583
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And the ball rolls free,
So I scooped it up,

584
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,762
And you know what I did?

585
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:35,235
I drop-Kicked
From 50 yards out.

586
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:37,033
Ha ha! God, You
Should have seen it.

587
00:59:37,072 --> 00:59:40,000
Put us 3 points ahead.
Gave us the match.

588
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Fantastic.

589
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,092
Hello, Lionel.

590
00:59:57,135 --> 01:00:00,000
That's quite
A collection Of stiffs You got down there.

591
01:00:00,204 --> 01:00:03,173
And I thought you were
Such a quiet chappie.

592
01:00:03,207 --> 01:00:05,801
Uncle les,
They're not what you think.

593
01:00:05,843 --> 01:00:07,140
Back off, Mate!

594
01:00:07,178 --> 01:00:08,236
Lay a hand on me,

595
01:00:08,279 --> 01:00:10,338
I'll have you
For breakfast.

596
01:00:12,517 --> 01:00:13,984
I'm sorry, Lionel.

597
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,467
If I don't
Report this,

598
01:00:15,502 --> 01:00:20,496
I'll be an accessory
After the fact.

599
01:00:25,745 --> 01:00:28,000
I hope they can keep it
Out of the papers

600
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
For your mother's sake.

601
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
She always
Hated a scandal.

602
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,797
This is hard
For me, Lionel,

603
01:00:33,835 --> 01:00:36,326
Informing on
Me sister's boy and all.

604
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:37,998
Of course, If I was
To keep me mouth shut,

605
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:39,700
I'd be taking
A hell of a risk.

606
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:44,000
Hey, Put me through
To the police, Please.

607
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,490
Of course,
If I was to, Uh,

608
01:00:45,535 --> 01:00:48,663
Get my fair share
Of vera's estate,

609
01:00:48,705 --> 01:00:49,967
I might be
More inclined

610
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
To protect a member
Of the family.

611
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,194
You want the money?

612
01:00:54,235 --> 01:00:55,998
Speak to sergeant bauer.

613
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,994
I'd like to report
A multiple murder.

614
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,400
Yes, I'll wait.

615
01:01:04,436 --> 01:01:08,429
The money and the house.

616
01:01:10,842 --> 01:01:15,836
Blood is thicker
Than water, Lionel.

617
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,262
Yeah, G'day.

618
01:01:50,301 --> 01:01:53,031
Les about?

619
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:54,401
Hey, You bastard!

620
01:01:54,438 --> 01:01:55,370
Thought
We'd pop over

621
01:01:55,406 --> 01:01:57,499
And take a squish
At your new digs.

622
01:01:57,541 --> 01:01:58,303
Yeah, Mate. Why not?

623
01:01:58,342 --> 01:02:00,105
Rip the skins off
A few brown ones.

624
01:02:00,144 --> 01:02:01,441
Yeah. We'll make
A night of it.

625
01:02:01,479 --> 01:02:02,503
Where are you going?

626
01:02:02,546 --> 01:02:03,103
Just for a walk.

627
01:02:03,147 --> 01:02:04,000
No, Mate. These people
Want a feast.

628
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,864
We'll get a party going.

629
01:02:04,901 --> 01:02:06,869
Let's get
Some snacks, Mate.

630
01:02:06,903 --> 01:02:09,201
You got real-Live
Stiffs here?

631
01:02:09,238 --> 01:02:11,706
Man: Hey, Les, Let's
Stick some real music on.

632
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:13,504
Oh, Yeah.
Comin' through, Buzzer.

633
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:15,841
Clear the dance floor.

634
01:02:15,878 --> 01:02:16,867
I don't know
What sort

635
01:02:16,913 --> 01:02:18,847
Of kinky shit
You're into,

636
01:02:18,881 --> 01:02:23,875
But I want
Those things buried.

637
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Come on, Babe.
Have a dance.

638
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,968
It's no good asking lionel.

639
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
He's nothing
Like his old man.

640
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,228
He was a real stick man.

641
01:03:16,268 --> 01:03:18,532
Used to pull the birds
Like you wouldn't believe.

642
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:20,436
Don't talk about
My father like that.

643
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Tasty.

644
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,332
You got anything else
That I can, Uh,

645
01:03:30,369 --> 01:03:31,097
Nibble on?

646
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
So, You know,
I throw him a dummy,

647
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Fooled him
Completely.

648
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Now, You
Gotta imagine,

649
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
This is, Like,
10, 15 Yards out

650
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,694
From the sideline.

651
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,262
There are several
Of these big buggers

652
01:03:46,302 --> 01:03:47,599
Coming towards me,
Right?

653
01:03:47,636 --> 01:03:48,500
So what do I do?

654
01:03:48,537 --> 01:03:50,266
L... I put
My head down,

655
01:03:50,306 --> 01:03:52,000
And I shot
To get a touchdown

656
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,729
Right between
The posts. God.

657
01:03:53,769 --> 01:03:55,100
The coach reckons
I'm a dead certain

658
01:03:55,137 --> 01:03:56,331
For the next
Callback trials.

659
01:03:56,371 --> 01:03:57,668
What do you think
About that, Paquita?

660
01:03:57,706 --> 01:04:03,000
You could be going out
With the next bob scott.

661
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Where were you?

662
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,899
A cute little
Se}orita, Eh?

663
01:04:49,899 --> 01:04:50,365
Oh, God. Wait.

664
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,000
Oh, Come on, Now.
Don't be a party pooper.

665
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,467
Come and have a drink.

666
01:04:54,935 --> 01:04:57,000
Oh, I bet you go off
Like a rocket.

667
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:04,000
Oh! Oh! Little bitch!

668
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,592
I'll get you!
Where is she?

669
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:09,000
Aw, You foreign bitch!
I'll get...

670
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,991
Hello?

671
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:34,504
Hello?

672
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,991
Paquita!

673
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,991
Paquita.

674
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,993
"Death surrounds him."

675
01:06:15,977 --> 01:06:19,000
Lionel: They're not...
Dead exactly.

676
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
They're just...

677
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,730
Sort of rotting.

678
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:25,170
Nurse McTavish.

679
01:06:25,206 --> 01:06:27,572
Father McGruder.

680
01:06:29,009 --> 01:06:32,001
Your mother!

681
01:06:33,247 --> 01:06:37,047
I don't know what to do,
You know? I...

682
01:06:37,084 --> 01:06:41,077
Don't know how
To stop it.

683
01:06:41,822 --> 01:06:45,000
You must destroy them.

684
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,467
I...

685
01:06:46,501 --> 01:06:48,492
I can't.

686
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:50,795
Not mum.

687
01:06:52,874 --> 01:06:57,868
That thing
Is not your mother.

688
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,993
Come on, Les.
Join in.

689
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,992
I'll do it.

690
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,830
Aye, What's this?

691
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:44,428
Her lap bird's
Flying the coop, Is it?

692
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:45,095
Out of the way!

693
01:08:45,138 --> 01:08:47,000
You're not going
Anywhere, Mate,

694
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Until the house
Papers come through.

695
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,989
Come on, Lionel.

696
01:08:51,034 --> 01:08:53,161
No, You don't!

697
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,991
Come on!

698
01:09:10,035 --> 01:09:12,000
Rrrr! You foreign
Animal bitch.

699
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,437
Time you and I got
Better acquainted.

700
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

701
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Help! Someone!

702
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,991
Please!

703
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,934
For God's sake, Run!

704
01:10:08,968 --> 01:10:11,960
Not so loud, Mate!

705
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,991
Bitch!

706
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,992
Lmadre de dios!

707
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,898
Help us!

708
01:11:05,934 --> 01:11:08,926
Bugger that!

709
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,992
Run, Paquita!

710
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,991
Help!

711
01:12:16,444 --> 01:12:18,275
Help! Help! Help!

712
01:12:18,312 --> 01:12:21,304
Oh, No! Shit!

713
01:12:24,819 --> 01:12:27,811
Help! Help!

714
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,993
Please don't kill me.

715
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,992
It's ok. It's me.

716
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
That's a nasty plaque
Problem you got there, Mate.

717
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,865
Got a bit of a cavity
There, Mate.

718
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,991
Mandy.

719
01:15:11,536 --> 01:15:13,697
It's me, Rita.

720
01:15:13,738 --> 01:15:15,729
Remember?

721
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,993
Ya mutant
Little shit!

722
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,992
You'll be ok.

723
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,295
For christ's sake,
Let me in!

724
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:51,670
Let me in!

725
01:18:54,295 --> 01:18:56,593
Let me in! Help me!

726
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:57,460
Help!

727
01:18:57,498 --> 01:18:59,261
Paquita,
We must.

728
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,325
Come on! Help!

729
01:19:01,368 --> 01:19:03,359
Quickly!

730
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:14,000
There's thousands of them!

731
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,901
What the hell's this?!

732
01:19:16,936 --> 01:19:18,000
Leave her alone.

733
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,126
She's been bitten!

734
01:19:19,168 --> 01:19:20,726
You know
What that means?!

735
01:19:20,769 --> 01:19:22,464
She's gonna turn
Into one of them!

736
01:19:22,504 --> 01:19:25,496
I won't. I won't.

737
01:19:27,776 --> 01:19:28,936
Help me!

738
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,365
You stay out of it!

739
01:20:08,401 --> 01:20:10,961
I know what to do.
She's history.

740
01:20:11,004 --> 01:20:12,062
I've read
The comics!

741
01:20:12,105 --> 01:20:14,767
Total lobotomy!
Dismemberment!

742
01:20:14,808 --> 01:20:16,070
Are you crazy?!

743
01:20:16,109 --> 01:20:22,105
There's no room for
Hysterical women in my unit.

744
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,994
Step right up,
You creepo bastards!

745
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:27,967
Lionel.

746
01:21:28,001 --> 01:21:29,662
Paquita!

747
01:21:29,702 --> 01:21:31,693
No!

748
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,164
Just as well someone around
Here's got balls, Eh, Girls?

749
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,993
Goddamn little rug rat!

750
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:13,732
Get out of the way!

751
01:23:15,345 --> 01:23:19,338
Come on, You little maggot!

752
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,994
Where are you,
You little crawler?!

753
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,991
Lionel!

754
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,992
Holy christ. Vera.

755
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,991
Leave me.

756
01:25:11,618 --> 01:25:14,610
Party's over.

757
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,991
Rita?

758
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,991
No!

759
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Now, You just get
Out of here.

760
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,991
What?

761
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,935
Haven't seen mum yet.

762
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,595
Come to mummy,
Lionel.

763
01:31:04,637 --> 01:31:06,628
Come on!

764
01:32:02,362 --> 01:32:04,353
No!

765
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,993
You don't
Scare me, Mum.

766
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
All my life...

767
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,468
You told me nothing
But lies.

768
01:32:18,502 --> 01:32:20,663
That stuff about dad,

769
01:32:20,704 --> 01:32:24,697
None of that was true!

770
01:32:27,778 --> 01:32:30,872
You drowned them both,
Mum...

771
01:32:30,915 --> 01:32:33,179
Dad and that blond woman.

772
01:32:33,217 --> 01:32:34,582
You caught them together,

773
01:32:34,618 --> 01:32:36,000
And you killed them,
Didn't you?

774
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
How dare you speak
To me like that?

775
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,992
Didn't you?!

776
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,663
Lionel, Help! Quick!

777
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:06,695
Slut!

778
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,868
Don't you touch her.

779
01:33:18,903 --> 01:33:20,700
No!

780
01:33:20,739 --> 01:33:26,735
No one will ever love you
Like your mother.

781
01:33:27,912 --> 01:33:29,903
No! No!

782
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,992
Such a good boy.

783
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,991
No.

784
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,969
The sign of love

785
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,992
Has cost its toll

786
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,992
The truth foretold

787
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,992
Is now revealed

788
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,992
Its mystery

789
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,992
Our destiny

790
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,992
The stars and moon

791
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,992
The sign of love

792
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,992
Has come at last

793
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,992
2 Lonely hearts

794
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,992
Are in the past

795
01:36:48,839 --> 01:36:51,603
It blazes bright

796
01:36:51,641 --> 01:36:54,804
Love's blinding light

797
01:36:54,845 --> 01:36:57,000
Through darkest night

798
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,993
And floods the room

799
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,992
The stars and moon

800
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,992
The sign of love

801
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,992
Our time has come

802
01:37:34,971 --> 01:37:39,000
The stars and moon

803
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,992
Will shine for us

804
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,561
The stars and the moon

805
01:37:46,604 --> 01:37:49,596
Are guiding us

806
01:37:51,609 --> 01:37:54,601
We follow the sign

807
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,992
To perfect love

808
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,992
The sign of love

809
01:38:32,204 --> 01:38:35,196
Our time has come

810
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,992
The stars and moon

811
01:38:39,838 --> 01:38:42,830
Will shine for us

812
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,766
The stars and the moon

813
01:38:47,804 --> 01:38:50,796
Are guiding us

814
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,992
We follow the sign

815
01:38:56,471 --> 01:38:59,463
To perfect love
