1
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,089
Am I staring?

2
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,320
A little.

3
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,401
Sorry.

4
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,651
You just have such beautiful skin.

5
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,490
I'm Ruby, by the way.

6
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,723
Do you have a name,
or you want me to guess?

7
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,526
- Jesse.
- Jesse.

8
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,887
And you just got to LA, Jesse?

9
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,090
How did you know?

10
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,290
You've got that look.

11
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,211
Oh, don't worry, honey.

12
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,925
That whole deer-in-the-headlights thing
is exactly what they want.

13
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,249
Here. Let me help you with that.

14
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,291
Are you a model?

15
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,788
No, I do makeup.

16
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,794
So, where are you staying?

17
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,046
At a motel in Pasadena.

18
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,799
By yourself?

19
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:35,929
Mmm-hmm.

20
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,076
What do your parents think about that?

21
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,942
They don't really.

22
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:48,450
Don't think, or just don't care?

23
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,451
They're not around anymore.

24
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:58,485
I'm sorry.

25
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,998
Hey, You wanna go somewhere?

26
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,310
Where?

27
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,304
A party.

28
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,649
What kind of party?

29
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,450
The fun kind.

30
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,098
God, I love this color on me.

31
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,512
Red Rum.

32
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,593
What?

33
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,906
That's what it's called.

34
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,772
They say women are
more likely to buy a lipstick

35
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,108
if it's named after food or sex.

36
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,282
Just think about it.

37
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,785
Black Honey.

38
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,113
Plum Passion.

39
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,557
Peachy Keen.

40
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,450
Pink Pussy.

41
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,630
What about you, Sarah,
what would your lipstick be called?

42
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,294
Fuck off.

43
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,463
Apt.

44
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,304
What about you?

45
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,968
What about me?

46
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,806
Are you food

47
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:37,782
or are you sex?

48
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:44,121
She's dessert because she's so sweet.

49
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:53,460
Hmm.

50
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,168
Shouldn't we get back to the party?

51
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,302
Don't talk.

52
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,344
Still.

53
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,987
So what do we think?

54
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,276
I think that I wish I had your hair.

55
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,597
Is this your natural color?

56
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,206
You are just so beautiful.
Don't you think that she's just perfect?

57
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,677
Is that your real nose?

58
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,877
Yeah.

59
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,843
God, life is so unfair.

60
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,221
Gigi just got out of the body shop.
She's still a little sensitive.

61
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,053
You had work done?

62
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,394
You say that like it's a bad thing.

63
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,725
Sweet, plastics is just good grooming.

64
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,733
Imagine going a year
without brushing your teeth.

65
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,559
I go to this guy in Beverly Hills.

66
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,569
- Andrew.
- Dr. Andrew.

67
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,573
- She is in love with him.
- Of course I love him.

68
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,903
Look at me.

69
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,568
He calls me The Bionic Woman.

70
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,746
Is that a compliment?

71
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,250
I hear your parents are dead.

72
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,085
That must be really hard for you.

73
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,094
Do you have other family?

74
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,174
No.

75
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,358
No one at all?

76
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,268
You must have a boyfriend.

77
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,410
All she really wants to know is,
who are you fucking?

78
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,780
Sorry?

79
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,876
What?

80
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,916
Isn't that what everyone wants to know?

81
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,288
A pretty new girl walks into a room,
everyone's head turns,

82
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,453
looks her up and down, wondering,

83
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,053
"Who is she fucking?

84
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,457
"Who could she fuck?

85
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,901
"And how high can she climb,
and is it higher than me?"

86
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,218
I don't... I don't know.

87
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,972
I just got to town,
so I don't know anybody here.

88
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,479
Right. But you've slept with men before.

89
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,481
You do sleep with men, don't you?

90
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,651
All the time.

91
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,663
I think I will get back to the party.

92
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,996
Someone said there was gonna be a show.

93
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,667
Jesse, are you coming?

94
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,234
Who did you say shot these? A boyfriend?

95
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,499
Not really.

96
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,600
Not really or no?

97
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,775
No.

98
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,375
It was just some guy, he found me online.

99
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,951
Be careful with that.

100
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,425
You're very fit.

101
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,583
Thank you.

102
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,858
You're also very young.

103
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,922
I think you're perfect.

104
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,700
I would never say you're fat.

105
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,538
But that doesn't mean
that someone else won't.

106
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,628
Understand?

107
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,809
I see 20 or 30 girls
come in here every day.

108
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,208
Mostly from small towns with big dreams

109
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,146
because some guy named Chad
in the food court told them

110
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,811
they were beautiful enough to be a model.

111
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,979
And they're all good.

112
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:01,814
You...

113
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,654
You're going to be great.

114
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,979
Some girls crack under the pressure,
but if you do okay,

115
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,663
then we are off to New York.

116
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,502
You'll work with all the top designers.

117
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,736
International success.

118
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,924
So the first thing we need to do

119
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,678
is get you some pictures
that are a little less amateur hour,

120
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,115
no offense.

121
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,089
Jack MacArthur is in town. Do you know him?

122
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,592
No.

123
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,820
Get to know him.

124
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:43,509
I had to pull some strings,
but I sent him your Polaroids,

125
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,865
and he has agreed to do a test with you.

126
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,428
How does that sound?

127
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:50,935
It sounds great.

128
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,531
It sounds...

129
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,706
Sounds good.

130
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,611
Well, there's just a teensy bit
of paperwork.

131
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,128
I'll need a copy of your drivers license
and a voided check,

132
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,881
and I can take those right now.

133
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,120
When did you graduate from high school?

134
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,861
I'm actually still kind of working on it.

135
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,138
I need a parental consent form.

136
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,052
You can go.

137
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,152
Parental consent form.

138
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,593
Just one signature there
for parental consent.

139
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,596
One little signature and we're off.

140
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:54,837
When someone asks,
I want you to say you are 19.

141
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,016
Always 19.

142
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,905
Eighteen is too on the nose.

143
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,404
No one's going to believe that.

144
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,270
Honey.

145
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,113
People believe what they are told.

146
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,651
- Hi.
- Hi.

147
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,752
- I have...
- I bought you flowers, but...

148
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,982
- Oh. Sorry. You go.
- No, you first.

149
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:24,089
I was just gonna say
I signed with that agency.

150
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,605
That's great news. Congratulations.

151
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:27,755
Thanks.

152
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,432
Hey, did they say anything
about my pictures?

153
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,202
Didn't come up.

154
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,450
Cool, that's cool.

155
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,600
Come on.

156
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,111
Don't forget me when you're all famous now.

157
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:09,630
In Georgia, the sky is also this big.

158
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:14,097
Makes being a person down on Earth
feel really small.

159
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,371
You could feel small here, too.

160
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,207
Do you?

161
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,875
Sometimes.

162
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:29,984
When I was a kid,

163
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,289
I would sneak out onto the roof at night.

164
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:39,819
I thought the moon
looked like a big round eye.

165
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:45,135
And I would look up and I'd say,

166
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,638
"Do you see me?"

167
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,133
I would stay out there for hours.

168
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:56,403
Sometimes I'd fall asleep just dreaming.

169
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,179
About what?

170
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,420
What I would be.

171
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,424
What was that?

172
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,355
I could never figure it out.

173
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,940
I can't sing. I can't dance.

174
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,009
I can't write.

175
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,659
No real talent.

176
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,445
But I'm pretty,

177
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,571
and I can make money off pretty.

178
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,727
So...

179
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,045
I think you're probably good
at a lot of things.

180
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,120
You can't tell.

181
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,086
We just met.

182
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,611
We didn't just meet.

183
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,409
We met the other day.

184
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,091
Trust me.

185
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,965
I can tell.

186
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,410
They want me to lie.

187
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,090
Who wants you to lie?

188
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,570
The agency.

189
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,880
They want me to say I'm 19.

190
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,485
How old are you?

191
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,127
Sixteen last month.

192
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,400
You know, I think
I left the stove on at home.

193
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,925
Stop.

194
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,966
Listen. I think

195
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,966
you ought to do what you think is right.

196
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,285
I should go.

197
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,280
- Bye.
- Bye.

198
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,691
Thank you.

199
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,046
Jesse.

200
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,609
Do you wanna go out again?

201
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,846
Yeah. That...

202
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,730
That'd be cool.

203
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

204
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,560
- Yeah?
- Something's in my room.

205
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,240
What do you mean,
something's in your room?

206
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,970
I saw something in my room.

207
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,325
Are you high?

208
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,520
What are you doing?

209
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,647
Calling the police.

210
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

211
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,764
Relax, okay?

212
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,806
Mikey.

213
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,081
Yeah?

214
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,802
This lady has an unwanted guest.

215
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,366
212.

216
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,246
All right, asshole. Party's over.

217
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,850
Open up.

218
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,961
Give me the key.

219
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,769
Mikey, open the door.

220
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,210
Mikey.

221
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,085
The fuck?

222
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,686
You're paying for this.

223
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,160
I didn't do it.

224
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,641
You fucking kids are all the fucking same.

225
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,200
I will find you.

226
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,406
Got it?

227
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,562
There's your visitor.

228
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,881
You're done.

229
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,931
Let's go show him.

230
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,526
Jack?

231
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,081
Ready, ready.

232
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,124
Take off your shoes.

233
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,600
All right, everybody.

234
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,811
Thank you for your work.

235
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,804
It's gonna be a closed set.

236
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,440
I don't mind staying. It's not a problem.

237
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,521
We're good.

238
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,685
Take off your clothes.

239
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,086
Is there a problem?

240
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,247
All of it.

241
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,441
Turn around.

242
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,091
Jesse.

243
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,764
You're still here?

244
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,801
How did it go?

245
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,766
It went good.

246
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,490
It was great actually.

247
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,846
Did he say anything?

248
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,440
My agency said
if the pictures turned out good,

249
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,648
he might consider them for an editorial.

250
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,165
Do you think he would?

251
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,284
I think he makes
a lot of promises to young girls.

252
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,601
I should go, before my meter runs out.

253
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,361
I don't think you should be alone with him.

254
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,570
He seemed fine to me.

255
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,888
That's not what I'm saying, Jesse.

256
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,808
I'm not as helpless as I look.

257
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,560
Will you promise me something?

258
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,246
Will you call me if you need anything?

259
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,207
Night or day. Doesn't matter.

260
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,121
Give me your phone.

261
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,202
It's good to have good girls around.

262
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,045
You promise you'll call?

263
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,160
I promise.

264
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,449
Thank you for the makeup today.

265
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,680
Sorry I'm late.

266
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,640
Would you like to hear the specials?

267
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,087
- Sure.
- You're not gonna eat it.

268
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,448
But they work so hard to memorize them.

269
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,083
Today we have a loaded
baked potato with a side of broccoli,

270
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,771
a pan-seared halibut
served with rice and a fruit cup,

271
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,803
and a steak sandwich that comes with fries.

272
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,082
If I don't want fries,
could I substitute the fruit cup?

273
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,245
If you just want the fruit,
you'll have to order the fruit bowl.

274
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,081
How about we just have three coffees
and a fruit cup?

275
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,205
How was the shoot?

276
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,325
Jesse was there.

277
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,401
Who?

278
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,770
Oh, yeah, her.

279
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,611
Why?

280
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,320
Jack was shooting her.

281
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,481
What?

282
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,880
She's been in town for, like, a minute.

283
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,644
They brought her in for a test.

284
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,760
Jack doesn't test new models.

285
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,126
Well, he does now.

286
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,685
Apparently, they think
she is gonna be this giant star.

287
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,642
Jack shoots me all the time.

288
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,490
That's not gonna last.

289
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,760
What's that supposed to mean?

290
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,650
It means your expiration date
is almost due.

291
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,445
Who wants sour milk
when you can get fresh meat?

292
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,120
Right.

293
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,761
Sarah, these girls
come and go all the time.

294
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,640
She's not special yet.

295
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,721
Mmm...

296
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,800
But you have to admit,
there is something about her.

297
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,041
Like what?

298
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,000
She's young, and she's thin.

299
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,490
No, it's more than that.

300
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,520
She has that

301
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,931
thing.

302
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,246
Thank you.

303
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,571
Erin.

304
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,131
So the same. Straight back.

305
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,276
This way, ladies.

306
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,991
So do straight back between
the pillars, and then right back here.

307
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,494
Okay. Thank you very much.

308
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:26,967
Next.

309
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,210
Robert, you remember Sarah?

310
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:39,577
Oh.

311
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,423
Let's just see the walk.

312
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,513
Should I go again?

313
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,048
No, thank you, that will be all.

314
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:24,865
Could you come forward, please?

315
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,803
This is Jesse.

316
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,629
Where's your card?

317
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,831
I don't have one yet.

318
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:04,837
Jesse's new in town,

319
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,318
but she's just been signed
by Roberta Hoffmann.

320
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:08,775
How old are you?

321
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,242
Nineteen.

322
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,081
Any runway experience?

323
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:19,018
Not really.

324
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:22,514
Okay, let's see the walk, dear.

325
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:01,127
Thank you. We'll take her to measurements.

326
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,223
Thank you.

327
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:10,463
Lift up.

328
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:53,635
- You should really fix this.
- I don't wanna fix it.

329
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:06,111
I thought you did great.

330
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:08,345
Honest.

331
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:13,823
Don't do that.

332
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,330
Pretend that you don't know.

333
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,161
People see you.

334
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:23,664
They notice.

335
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:31,178
Do you know how lucky you are?

336
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:36,050
I'm a ghost.

337
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:45,860
What's it feel like?

338
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,059
What do you mean?

339
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:54,794
To walk into a room,

340
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:59,483
and it's like in the middle of winter,

341
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:00,906
you're the sun.

342
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,972
It's everything.

343
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:13,816
Ow!

344
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,686
- Oh, shit.
- Let me see.

345
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,401
Stop! Stop!

346
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:09,136
Sorry, I'm late.

347
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,438
Hey. No problem.

348
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:22,646
Are you the manager?

349
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,228
Depends who's asking.

350
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:26,308
My friend says she owes you some money.

351
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,170
Room 212.

352
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,073
Oh, the wildcat.

353
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:35,681
That's some real hard candy.

354
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:37,479
You know what I mean?

355
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:39,480
I beg your pardon?

356
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,180
- What, are you a Mormon?
- No, sir.

357
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,503
- Are you with the DPH?
- No.

358
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,187
'Cause we passed our last inspection.

359
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,192
I can show you the paperwork if you want.

360
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,612
She said she owes you for the damages.

361
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:58,536
I should charge her
for emotional distress.

362
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:01,272
You know how long it took
to get that thing out of here?

363
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:03,502
Well, I don't think she should have to pay.

364
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:07,215
- That so?
- Yeah. I mean, technically it wasn't her fault.

365
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,873
Not her fault?

366
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:10,610
Who do you think
left the sliding door open?

367
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:12,277
- Yeah, but I don't see how that makes...
- Was it you?

368
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:14,378
- No.
- Sure as hell wasn't me.

369
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:17,034
How much?

370
00:55:17,114 --> 00:55:19,617
New door plus labor.

371
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:21,286
At least 100.

372
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:28,297
Or was it two?

373
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:35,407
- I have 140 in cash.
- Sold.

374
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:45,082
- Is there a pharmacy around here?
- Why?

375
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:47,821
She send you out for tampons, too?

376
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:50,385
You know, you've got
a real attitude problem, you know that?

377
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:53,989
I'm just being friendly.

378
00:55:54,418 --> 00:55:57,241
I just wanna make sure
you're getting something out of this deal.

379
00:55:57,321 --> 00:55:58,391
'Cause if you're not,

380
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,845
got plenty of other girls here.

381
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:05,031
Take a peek in Room 214
if you get a chance.

382
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:08,418
Rented it this week to a girl
from Sandusky, Ohio.

383
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:09,602
Runaway.

384
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,178
Thirteen years old.

385
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,179
Real Lolita shit.

386
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,006
Real Lolita shit.

387
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,284
Room 214.

388
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,947
Gotta be seen.

389
00:56:59,316 --> 00:57:00,317
Jesse?

390
00:57:01,218 --> 00:57:02,720
What are you doing here?

391
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:05,325
They told me to wait.

392
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:06,823
For what?

393
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:09,301
For makeup.

394
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:11,970
You're in the show?

395
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:14,164
Yeah.

396
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:16,467
This show?

397
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:19,245
Yes.

398
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:23,746
That's my chair.

399
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,192
Well.

400
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:40,768
You certainly move fast.

401
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,502
What do you mean?

402
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:45,867
You must be fucking him.

403
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:48,666
Sarno doesn't let just anyone
walk his collection.

404
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:52,144
I don't think I'm his type.

405
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:53,606
Why not?

406
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:55,612
You're very masculine.

407
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:00,221
I bet they made you do the casting.

408
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,800
I didn't have to.

409
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,224
I just come in, choose what I wanna wear.

410
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:09,688
But I'm not sure
about the makeup this year.

411
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:15,400
I think you look perfect.

412
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,282
Yeah.

413
00:58:18,362 --> 00:58:21,036
Well, flattery will get you everywhere.

414
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,409
You wanna know what I had done, don't you?

415
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:28,959
Well, I thought I'd get more work
if I went down a cup size.

416
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,061
So I look like a hanger. You know?

417
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:32,984
But then my surgeon, Dr. Andrew,

418
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,420
he pointed out a lot
of other problems with my body.

419
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:39,670
So I had them shave my jaw,
I had a slight eyebrow lift,

420
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,924
new nose, cheeks, inner and outer lipo,

421
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,730
oh, and they pinned my ears.

422
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:48,896
Why?

423
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,567
So I could wear a ponytail.

424
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,404
Didn't it hurt?

425
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:57,111
Anything worth having hurts a little.

426
00:58:58,235 --> 00:59:00,772
Besides, nobody likes the way they look.

427
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:03,445
I do.

428
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:06,519
Are you Jesse?

429
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:07,611
Mmm-hmm.

430
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,280
They wanna see you.

431
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,123
I already had my fitting.

432
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:13,117
I'm just the messenger.

433
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,305
You.

434
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,649
I've decided you're gonna close the show.

435
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:37,067
"...pry through the portage
of the head..."

436
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:39,089
- Hi.
- ...like a brass cannon."

437
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:41,843
I want you to meet my friend.
This is Dean.

438
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:43,177
Hi.

439
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,261
- Your name's Bean?
- No, Dean.

440
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:46,429
- Dean?
- Dean, yeah.

441
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:48,819
- Dean, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

442
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:51,835
Well, come, join us. Have a drink.

443
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:53,189
Sit down.

444
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:54,852
I don't think there's room for two.

445
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:58,598
That's all right,
we can just sit over there.

446
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,762
"Now set the teeth

447
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,773
"and stretch the nostril wide,

448
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,376
"hold hard the breath

449
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:13,606
"and bend up every spirit
to his full height.

450
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:16,183
"Oh, oh!"

451
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,131
And so on and so forth.

452
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:22,465
Wow!

453
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,456
Did you always wanna be an actor?

454
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,959
Well, performing always
came naturally to me

455
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:28,805
because I'm a creator.

456
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:31,729
All right? I build, I make.
It's in my blood.

457
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:36,531
So whether I'm designing a collection
or creating a character,

458
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:38,895
it's all the same, right?

459
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:43,386
- I went out for a film last week.
- Oh, yeah, how did it go?

460
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,810
They said my face didn't match my voice.

461
01:06:45,902 --> 01:06:48,075
- Well, you can fix your face.
- No, don't do that.

462
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:49,239
Why not?

463
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:53,582
Because you can always tell
when beauty is manufactured.

464
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,316
And if you aren't born beautiful,
you never will be.

465
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:59,169
- That's terrible.
- No, it's true.

466
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:00,751
I don't think you can always tell.

467
01:07:02,919 --> 01:07:03,989
Dean,

468
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:08,097
we're having a little debate over here,
and we need your expertise.

469
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:10,599
Okay.

470
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:13,349
You know Gigi, right?

471
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:14,931
Well, I mean, we just met.

472
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:18,336
Will you stand up so that
he can take a look at you?

473
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:19,435
Go on, stand up.

474
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:26,178
Well?

475
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:30,116
Well, what?

476
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,023
What do you think?
Do you think she is beautiful?

477
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,693
I don't know, I mean...

478
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,193
Yeah, I guess she's fine.

479
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:42,361
Yes, yes. That's exactly the word
that I was looking for.

480
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:44,131
She's fine, right?

481
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:45,535
You can sit down now, thanks.

482
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:47,969
Thank you, Dean.

483
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,901
Now look at Jesse.

484
01:07:53,136 --> 01:07:56,083
Nothing fake, nothing false.

485
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,816
A diamond in a sea of glass.

486
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:06,885
True beauty is the highest
currency we have.

487
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,155
Now, without it, she would be nothing.

488
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:13,994
I think you're wrong.

489
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:15,992
Excuse me.

490
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,599
I said, I think you're wrong.

491
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:24,420
So are you gonna tell me that
it's what's inside that counts?

492
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,343
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.

493
01:08:29,072 --> 01:08:30,517
Well, I think

494
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:34,012
that if she wasn't beautiful,

495
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,752
you wouldn't have even stopped to look.

496
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:49,360
Beauty isn't everything.
It's the only thing.

497
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,644
Hey, let's get out of here.

498
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:01,981
I wanna go.

499
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:05,218
So go.

500
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,511
What are you doing here?

501
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,150
What are you?

502
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:47,888
Is that what you want?

503
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,923
You wanna be like them?

504
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:56,602
I don't wanna be them.

505
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:03,367
They wanna be me.

506
01:13:56,299 --> 01:13:57,903
Wider.

507
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,357
Wider.

508
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,368
- Hello?
- Ruby.

509
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,800
- Thank God you're awake.
- Jesse?

510
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:15,160
I didn't know who to call.

511
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,480
Are you okay?

512
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,091
Lt sounds like he's killing her.

513
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,682
What? Who is?

514
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,730
What do I do?

515
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,409
He already tried to get in.

516
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,245
Can you get out?

517
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,610
I think so.

518
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,760
Come here.

519
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,565
You're gonna be safe.

520
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,811
I brought you some things.

521
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,167
Thanks.

522
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,247
You can wear this if you want.

523
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,767
Unless you prefer to sleep naked.

524
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,240
Are you going out?

525
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,129
I'm not going anywhere.

526
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,008
I'm going to stay here with you.

527
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,285
This house is amazing.

528
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,526
How long have you lived here?

529
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,720
I don't live here.

530
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,727
But I thought you said
this was your house.

531
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,401
No, I said I'm house-sitting.

532
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,889
Watering the plants.

533
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,410
Checking the mail.

534
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,205
Oh, well...

535
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,241
Do you think they'll mind
that I'm crashing?

536
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:13,328
You can stay here for as long as you like.

537
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,850
Sit.

538
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,805
My mom used to brush my hair
after a bad day.

539
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,605
It's very soothing.

540
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,206
Ruby?

541
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,649
Just relax.

542
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,166
Ruby?

543
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,601
Mmm?

544
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,406
Thank you.

545
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,561
For what?

546
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,808
For being so good to me.

547
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,602
It's what friends are for.

548
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,044
No, I mean...

549
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,643
I think you're really wonderful.

550
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,965
I think you're just...

551
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,450
I think you are, too.

552
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,842
I think you're so beautiful.

553
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,440
And you have such beautiful skin.

554
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,600
What are you doing?

555
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,604
I thought that's what you wanted.

556
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:57,761
No.

557
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:00,561
Oh.

558
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,964
It's not what you think.

559
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,685
Then what is it?

560
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,850
I lied before.

561
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:35,360
I've never been with anyone like that.

562
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:50,960
I don't care.

563
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,087
Ruby.

564
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,727
Ruby.

565
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,810
I don't care.

566
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,360
Stop.

567
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,120
- Stop.
- I want to.

568
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,600
- I wanna be your first.
- Stop.

569
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,284
I said stop!

570
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:41,686
Jesse.

571
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:45,685
What are you doing?

572
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,487
You know what my mother used to call me?

573
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,246
Dangerous.

574
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,768
"You're a dangerous girl."

575
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:12,003
She was right.

576
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,446
I am dangerous.

577
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,924
I know what I look like.

578
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,291
And what's wrong with that anyway?

579
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,406
Women would kill to look like this.

580
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,411
They carve and stuff

581
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,965
and inject themselves.

582
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:39,529
They starve to death,

583
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,244
hoping,

584
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:48,204
praying that one day they'll look
like a second-rate version of me.

585
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:12,444
Are we having a party or something?

586
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

587
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,320
My girlfriend,
she hasn't worked in months.

588
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:29,200
I mean, I keep telling her,
"Girl, you need to retire."

589
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:30,641
Right.

590
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:34,720
Once you hit 21 in this industry,
you're so irrelevant.

591
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,120
Try 20.

592
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:38,480
True. She won't listen.

593
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,005
Of course she won't.

594
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,800
No.

595
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:45,320
I mean, she's so desperate,
the other day she went uptown,

596
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:49,280
she was trying to buy this baby seal fat
from this random woman.

597
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,407
What, you think that's funny?

598
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:06,640
No, I don't.

599
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:10,565
You ever had a girl screw you out of a job?

600
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:16,966
Yes.

601
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,602
So what did you do about it?

602
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,325
I ate her.

603
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:29,485
Ew!

604
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,010
Gross.

605
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:33,845
Do I know you?

606
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,890
What are you doing here?

607
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,568
I'm waiting for my friend.

608
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,002
I'd like to use you for this.

609
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,209
Would you be okay with that?

610
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:04,881
Annie, you're fired!

611
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:09,325
Thank you.

612
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,769
Are you serious?

613
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:15,360
It's not fair.

614
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,363
You... You can't fire me.

615
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:37,641
Gigi.

616
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:41,927
Can you tell us what's so interesting?

617
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,370
You're staring in the pool.

618
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,280
Look in the camera.

619
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:33,762
I need to get her out of me.

620
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:37,091
I need to get her out of me.
