8
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:28,856
This girl is accusing you

9
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:31,124
of cutting her face
with a razor.

10
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:32,162
Is this true?

11
00:04:33,796 --> 00:04:35,061
No, Mother.

12
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:37,297
She's a liar.

13
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:39,299
Did you hear
what Peter said, Giovanni?

14
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:41,102
Yes, milady.

15
00:04:41,104 --> 00:04:44,972
- But that would...
- The girl is a liar. That'll be the end of it.

16
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:47,010
I want her off my property
by this evening.

17
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,727
You know I love
you, don't you?

18
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:06,096
I do.

19
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:09,299
Give me the razor, Peter.

20
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,965
No, Mother.

21
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,003
Please, do it for me.

22
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:15,268
My father gave it to me.

23
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,372
It's mine.

24
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:12,826
I see you found your dog
in the end.

25
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:15,496
Inside a box.
Underground.

26
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:17,431
It's your fault.
You took too long.

27
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:19,232
The garden isn't so big.

28
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:21,402
Lasciami!

29
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:23,304
Try it... peasant.

30
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:27,474
Lay one hand on me and my mother
will cast your family out.

31
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:30,514
And you... will starve.

32
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

33
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:53,586
You're even more stupid
than I thought.

34
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:55,457
Did you think I didn't
recognize you?

35
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:21,985
I didn't know you were
a poet, Alfredo.

36
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:27,153
"And Oh! Far worse
than all beside.

37
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:28,491
"You killed the dog..."

38
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:35,030
And now you will die.

39
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:00,055
Let me out!

40
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:03,657
Let me out of here,
you bastard.

41
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,258
I'll have you killed for this.

42
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:06,686
Your materials are here,
Professor Nash.

43
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:08,457
- From Froome? On my desk please.
- Yeah.

44
00:11:58,174 --> 00:11:59,174
No, not yet.

45
00:12:00,742 --> 00:12:03,579
Please tell me,
why do you have this book?

46
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:08,818
Fine.

47
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:34,711
I think I'm in for it with Liz.

48
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:36,843
Boys?

49
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:38,515
Christ, no.

50
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:41,918
She thinks I'm a total idiot.

51
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:47,256
In reality I suspect it's
something to do with her mother.

52
00:12:49,324 --> 00:12:50,526
Do you think
she feels guilty?

53
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,558
Guilty?

54
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,427
Liz?

55
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:57,431
After she died, you stopped
traveling, locked yourself away.

56
00:12:57,433 --> 00:13:00,300
I hate to say it,
but you're wasting your life.

57
00:13:00,302 --> 00:13:03,803
Maybe Liz thinks it's...
because of her.

58
00:13:03,805 --> 00:13:06,842
What person's gonna give me a
chance after messing up like that?

59
00:13:08,244 --> 00:13:10,244
There's a restoration job
going in Italy.

60
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:12,215
Quite interesting,
not too demanding.

61
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:15,282
Where?

62
00:13:15,284 --> 00:13:16,716
Town in Sicily.

63
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:18,320
There's even a school for Liz.

64
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:22,759
You've thought
of everything, boss.

65
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:27,893
That way you can show the
world what I already know.

66
00:13:27,895 --> 00:13:29,431
That you can still
run a site.

67
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:18,513
And this is
the English cemetery.

68
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:22,715
Much of it destroyed
by the earthquake.

69
00:14:22,717 --> 00:14:26,952
Along with almost 90%
of the estate's capitals.

70
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:29,922
Messina was one of
the richest cities in Sicily.

71
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:32,996
And English ancestors
did good business here.

72
00:14:34,862 --> 00:14:37,967
It's probably not the most
interesting place for a young girl.

73
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, when she
was six years old,

74
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:44,838
Liz was playing in the Catacombs of
Paris amongst millions of skeletons.

75
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,942
She'll be fine.

76
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:34,047
The school is a two-minutes
walk from the house.

77
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:36,550
You can go straight
through the wood.

78
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:38,855
"I can walk myself."

79
00:16:39,922 --> 00:16:40,923
Alone?

80
00:16:41,924 --> 00:16:42,924
We'll see.

81
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:47,796
Teenagers, no?

82
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:49,931
Tell me about it.

83
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:30,236
Professor.

84
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:32,906
- Norman.
- Norman.

85
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:35,911
Uh, you should come for
lunch at my house sometime.

86
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:39,079
If you like.

87
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:41,851
My aunt is a great cook
and she'd love to meet you.

88
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,285
Liz is a vegan.

89
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:47,721
It's a touchy subject.

90
00:17:47,723 --> 00:17:49,525
That's no problem for Aunt Emma.

91
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:51,861
Great.

92
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:54,763
Yes. Thank you.

93
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:29,691
<i>Grazie. Grazie.</i>

94
00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:50,209

95
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:51,212
"See.

96
00:19:54,082 --> 00:19:57,320
"A horrid
and wicked boy was he."

97
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:24,811
What did he say?

98
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:29,049
Um... These toys have been
put there for a little boy.

99
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:32,088
That way, he can keep
playing in the next life.

100
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:23,408
Help me.

101
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,412

Help me!

107
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,311
Are you all right?

108
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,182
You're scared.

109
00:26:02,182 --> 00:26:03,184
Why?

110
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:06,386
What's your name?

111
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:14,127
There you are.

112
00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:15,130
Hello.

113
00:26:16,663 --> 00:26:19,698
I'm Harriet. I live nearby.

114
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,236
I have to walk
through these woods.

115
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:23,468
You're English.

116
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,669
Yes, Oxford.

117
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:27,240
I didn't think there were
any English people left here.

118
00:26:27,242 --> 00:26:28,277
Somebody remained.

119
00:26:30,144 --> 00:26:31,278
Uh...

120
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,613
My daughter can't hear,
but she lip reads very well.

121
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:36,985
- Her name is, uh...
- Liz, yes, as you said.

122
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:39,287
Right.

123
00:26:40,354 --> 00:26:41,356
I'm Norman.

124
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:43,359
Pleased to meet you.

125
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:46,462
I hope to see you again.

126
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:49,497
Bye.

127
00:29:34,428 --> 00:29:35,764
Mom!

128
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:49,809
This is
Edgar Hoffmann.

129
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:54,679
He committed suicide in 1907,
slitting his own throat.

130
00:29:54,681 --> 00:29:55,814
Why did he do it?

131
00:29:55,816 --> 00:29:57,882
Well, no one seems to know.

132
00:29:57,884 --> 00:30:00,019
It was a big scandal
at the time.

133
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:01,920
He was one of the
wealthiest men on the island

134
00:30:01,922 --> 00:30:04,290
and Peter was his son.

135
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:08,494
Now, he disappeared
on the 25th of December, 1908.

136
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:10,329
That's three days
before the earthquake,

137
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:12,398
and he was never found.

138
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,567
- Hmm.
- Twelve years old at the time.

139
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:15,604
Quite the mystery.

140
00:30:22,877 --> 00:30:23,946
They destroyed it.

141
00:30:30,985 --> 00:30:32,353
Do these cameras work?

142
00:30:33,321 --> 00:30:35,620
Ah, unfortunately, they don't.

143
00:30:35,622 --> 00:30:37,389
Well, make them work.

144
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:38,626
Yes, sure.

145
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:53,634
Ho una cosa per lui.

146
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,651
A gift for you.

147
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:13,953
What is it?

148
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:17,822
It's a piece of material that
has been bathed in holy water.

149
00:32:17,824 --> 00:32:19,593
Inside it,
there's an image of Christ.

150
00:32:22,063 --> 00:32:25,965
She'd never admit it,
but she has one too.

151
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:29,801
My auntie believes that the
dead can either be good or evil.

152
00:32:29,803 --> 00:32:31,872
This helps keep
the evil ones away.

153
00:34:45,907 --> 00:34:46,975
You used this?

154
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,011
Don't worry.

155
00:34:51,211 --> 00:34:54,515
This...
It's only a toy.

156
00:35:00,854 --> 00:35:01,923
It's not a toy?

157
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:06,660
You heard Mum?

158
00:35:10,798 --> 00:35:11,800
Please.

159
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:13,869
You couldn't.

160
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:15,903
It's impossible.

161
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,276
"What will it take
for you to believe me?"

162
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:27,883
Liz...

163
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,529
Bianca.

164
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

165
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:28,367
What's missing?

166
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:30,372
Uh, in this mess
it's difficult to know.

167
00:37:32,372 --> 00:37:34,238
Where is the metal box?

168
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,076
It was right here
and now it's gone.

169
00:37:40,014 --> 00:37:42,481
I'm sorry, Bianca.

170
00:37:42,483 --> 00:37:45,285
Liz and I, we got off
to a bad start this morning.

171
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:49,690
We can talk about it
if you want.

172
00:38:05,072 --> 00:38:07,675
Correva l'anno 1908...

173
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:15,280
I never asked you
what brought you here.

174
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:16,515
I mean,

175
00:38:16,517 --> 00:38:18,983
for someone
of your experience...

176
00:38:18,985 --> 00:38:20,188
it's a little low key.

177
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:25,125
I thought
that was common knowledge.

178
00:38:27,427 --> 00:38:28,796
Not for me.

179
00:38:35,202 --> 00:38:37,535
Five years ago...

180
00:38:37,537 --> 00:38:39,907
my wife and I were working
on a dig in Turkey.

181
00:38:42,142 --> 00:38:44,244
During the excavation, we...

182
00:38:45,278 --> 00:38:48,282
uncovered this
Roman sarcophagus.

183
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,115
Beautiful.

184
00:38:51,117 --> 00:38:52,386
Totally intact.

185
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,220
All I had to do
was clean it up

186
00:38:55,222 --> 00:38:57,025
and it would
have been perfect.

187
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:02,126
I could've waited
till the next day.

188
00:39:02,128 --> 00:39:05,833
But I was so excited that I...
I couldn't leave it.

189
00:39:09,003 --> 00:39:11,305
So I sent Jane home
in her car...

190
00:39:13,106 --> 00:39:14,242
with Liz.

191
00:39:19,814 --> 00:39:20,815
A truck...

192
00:39:22,048 --> 00:39:23,985
knocked her car off a bridge.

193
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:30,289
While I...

194
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:32,927
was dusting the earth
off piece of marble.

195
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:37,999
I lost her...

196
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:42,470
and Liz lost her hearing.

197
00:39:47,608 --> 00:39:49,010
The day after the accident...

198
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:51,443
I...

199
00:39:51,445 --> 00:39:53,544
I returned to the site,

200
00:39:53,546 --> 00:39:55,881
I grabbed a pickax,

201
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:58,419
and I smashed that
sarcophagus into pieces.

202
00:40:35,521 --> 00:40:39,393
Go away.

203
00:40:41,361 --> 00:40:45,400
Go away.

204
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

205
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
"Tomorrow...
"school finishes early."

206
00:42:47,387 --> 00:42:48,689
Shall I pick you up?

207
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:52,260
I'm sorry about earlier.

208
00:44:11,371 --> 00:44:13,673
Liz.

209
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:16,444
I'm confused.

210
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,046
Please tell me, why?

211
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:24,785
I don't buy that.

212
00:44:25,818 --> 00:44:27,788
Something is up.

213
00:44:29,122 --> 00:44:30,390
I eat meat.

214
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:33,327
But with you there, never.

215
00:44:36,497 --> 00:44:37,498
Please.

216
00:44:38,631 --> 00:44:40,601
Can we talk
about this together?

217
00:44:50,144 --> 00:44:51,212
That's enough!

218
00:44:51,845 --> 00:44:53,845
I'm your father.

219
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:56,450
And I don't want
any cheeky talk from you.

220
00:44:57,684 --> 00:45:00,919
I'm not the father of the year,

221
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:04,856
but... I'm trying my best
to connect with you

222
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:07,095
and you're just
driving me crazy.

223
00:45:53,539 --> 00:45:55,707
Professor Nash.

224
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:58,178
Lieutenant Calarco,
the Carabiniere.

225
00:45:58,512 --> 00:45:59,778
Finally.

226
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,546
We've been waiting for you.

227
00:46:01,548 --> 00:46:04,448
We've had some
tomb damage and a theft.

228
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,285
Oh. What did they steal?

229
00:46:07,287 --> 00:46:10,287
A, uh, a metal box
containing some toys

230
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:13,390
and, uh, a wooden tombstone.

231
00:46:13,392 --> 00:46:15,760
That is not
much of a robbery.

232
00:46:15,762 --> 00:46:18,597
Have you made
any enemies here?

233
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:19,667
Enemies?

234
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:22,369
Whatever for?

235
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,206
Maybe you did something wrong?

236
00:46:26,572 --> 00:46:29,374
I'm simply trying
to protect this cemetery

237
00:46:29,376 --> 00:46:31,778
against vandals
and decades of neglect.

238
00:46:33,347 --> 00:46:35,680
This cemetery, not a colosseum.

239
00:46:35,682 --> 00:46:36,948
No one cares about the dead.

240
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,619
Well, I do, for a start.

241
00:46:41,622 --> 00:46:44,292
Professor, take my advice.

242
00:46:45,425 --> 00:46:46,992
Go back to England.

243
00:46:46,994 --> 00:46:50,198
How about
you do your job...

244
00:46:51,365 --> 00:46:52,433
I'll do mine.

245
00:46:53,834 --> 00:46:54,835
I am.

246
00:46:55,869 --> 00:46:56,871
I am.

247
00:47:05,778 --> 00:47:06,780
Hello!

248
00:47:30,537 --> 00:47:31,539
Hey.

249
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

250
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:52,385
What were you thinking?

251
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,019
The whole place is crumbling.

252
00:48:55,021 --> 00:48:58,088
All the coffins
are full of rusty nails.

253
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:00,791
Last week,
Giuseppe hurt himself the same way.

254
00:49:00,793 --> 00:49:02,729
It wasn't a nail.

255
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,939
This wasn't there before.

256
00:50:09,496 --> 00:50:10,698
Sure you wouldn't like some?

257
00:50:14,934 --> 00:50:16,770
I just wanted to apologize.

258
00:50:17,736 --> 00:50:18,937
For what?

259
00:50:18,939 --> 00:50:20,171
I'm a complete stranger

260
00:50:20,173 --> 00:50:22,941
and there I was chasing your
daughter around the woods.

261
00:50:22,943 --> 00:50:24,544
You could've got the wrong idea.

262
00:50:25,479 --> 00:50:27,544
I didn't get any idea.

263
00:50:27,546 --> 00:50:29,012
Well, I'm the one
who should be reprimanded.

264
00:50:29,014 --> 00:50:31,816
I was three hours late from
picking her up at school.

265
00:50:31,818 --> 00:50:34,655
She seemed
to manage just fine.

266
00:50:35,921 --> 00:50:37,988
With a father like me,
she has to.

267
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:39,626
Don't be so hard on yourself.

268
00:50:40,894 --> 00:50:42,463
We do what we can
for our children.

269
00:50:45,764 --> 00:50:46,833
Do you have kids?

270
00:50:48,602 --> 00:50:49,603
No.

271
00:50:51,104 --> 00:50:53,941
It's getting late.
I should get going.

272
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

273
00:54:32,325 --> 00:54:33,427
I scared you.

274
00:54:35,861 --> 00:54:39,133
I try to defend the villa...
as I can.

275
00:54:45,972 --> 00:54:48,742
Questo and <i>de Padre</i> Nicolo.

276
00:54:50,043 --> 00:54:52,443
He lost his arm...

277
00:54:52,445 --> 00:54:53,713
Nel terremoto.

278
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,079
In the earthquake.

279
00:54:56,081 --> 00:54:57,150
And who's this?

280
00:54:57,718 --> 00:54:59,820
His brother. Alfredo.

281
00:55:01,019 --> 00:55:02,822
He was not so lucky.

282
00:55:04,823 --> 00:55:07,258
What about Peter Hoffmann?

283
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,760
Your father must have told you
something about him.

284
00:55:11,164 --> 00:55:12,166
Well...

285
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:15,269
my father said...

286
00:55:16,802 --> 00:55:18,803
in all his life...

287
00:55:18,805 --> 00:55:22,776
he never met anyone
as mean as Peter.

288
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:27,378
<i>He enjoyed hurting others,</i>

289
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,950
<i>and he did it without fearing
to be punished.</i>

290
00:55:31,117 --> 00:55:34,852
<i>His mother
always protected him.</i>

291
00:55:34,854 --> 00:55:38,726
<i>She also did it
when he killed his father.</i>

292
00:55:39,626 --> 00:55:43,794
<i>Peter wanted his mother
for himself.</i>

293
00:55:43,796 --> 00:55:46,999
<i>She silenced what happened,
claiming it was a suicide.</i>

294
00:55:48,535 --> 00:55:51,001
<i>Everybody knew the truth
in the villa,</i>

295
00:55:51,003 --> 00:55:52,872
<i>but they were too scared
to talk.</i>

296
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:57,809
<i>One day, my uncle,
tired of that cruelty,</i>

297
00:55:57,811 --> 00:56:00,211
<i>decided to make him pay.</i>

298
00:56:00,213 --> 00:56:02,479
<i>Peter had to be stopped.</i>

299
00:56:40,485 --> 00:56:43,454
<i>But Alfredo
was not a murderer.</i>

300
00:56:43,456 --> 00:56:46,059
<i>And my father convinced him
to set him free.</i>

301
00:56:46,925 --> 00:56:48,227
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

302
00:56:49,195 --> 00:56:51,231
<i>he chose the wrong day.</i>

303
00:57:35,642 --> 00:57:39,109
<i>Corpses everywhere.</i>

304
00:57:39,111 --> 00:57:43,282
<i>Tens and thousands of bodies
were thrown into mass graves.</i>

305
00:57:50,456 --> 00:57:52,325
Alfredo!

306
00:57:54,693 --> 00:57:56,630
<i>With death everywhere,</i>

307
00:57:58,331 --> 00:58:01,568
<i>no one cared about Peter
and Alfredo's fate.</i>

308
00:58:37,436 --> 00:58:38,971
Alfredo!

309
00:58:40,372 --> 00:58:42,075
Alfredo!

310
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:45,646
Alfredo!

311
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,387
<i>It was
the 28th of December, 1908.</i>

312
00:58:56,389 --> 00:58:59,959
<i>The city of Messina
was completely destroyed.</i>

313
00:59:03,262 --> 00:59:05,463
<i>Mrs. Hoffmann
didn't accept the idea</i>

314
00:59:05,465 --> 00:59:08,765
<i>of losing this boy
she loved more than anything.</i>

315
00:59:08,767 --> 00:59:10,704
<i>And they were
not only rumors.</i>

316
00:59:11,537 --> 00:59:14,171
<i>That woman was a witch.</i>

317
00:59:14,173 --> 00:59:16,173
<i>Back in the villa,
my father saw her</i>

318
00:59:16,175 --> 00:59:19,642
<i>while she performed a ritual
on the body of a housekeeper.</i>

319
00:59:19,644 --> 00:59:22,146
<i>As soon as she was pulled
from the rubble...</i>

320
00:59:22,148 --> 00:59:23,280
Mom.

321
00:59:23,282 --> 00:59:25,716
<i>...that lifeless body
spoke with Peter's voice.</i>

322
00:59:25,718 --> 00:59:27,187
Help me.

323
00:59:28,787 --> 00:59:30,657
Help me.

324
00:59:32,592 --> 00:59:35,725
<i>On the same night, Mrs.
Hoffmann disappeared in the woods</i>

325
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:37,331
<i>and nobody saw her again.</i>

326
00:59:38,731 --> 00:59:42,099
<i>People say
she's still looking for Peter,</i>

327
00:59:42,101 --> 00:59:45,238
<i>and that she won't find peace
until they're back together.</i>

328
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,408
Let's try to finish classifying
the monuments tomorrow.

329
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:27,845
I want to get back to
London as soon as possible.

330
01:00:27,847 --> 01:00:29,682
- Why?
- It's Liz.

331
01:00:31,249 --> 01:00:33,052
She's unwell,
she needs help.

332
01:00:36,622 --> 01:00:38,258
That's a bishop sphere.

333
01:00:38,624 --> 01:00:39,856
Yes, it is.

334
01:00:39,858 --> 01:00:41,561
It's a dangerous thing.

335
01:00:42,695 --> 01:00:44,562
Why is it in this house?

336
01:00:44,564 --> 01:00:47,634
Liz had it. She's been
trying to contact her mother.

337
01:00:48,401 --> 01:00:49,603
And what happened?

338
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:52,669
Nothing.

339
01:00:52,671 --> 01:00:54,338
Nothing!

340
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,809
Her mother's dead!
What do you think happened?

341
01:01:00,813 --> 01:01:02,812
Liz should see
Aunt Emma.

342
01:01:02,814 --> 01:01:06,283
We already moved a month ago,
so this is past normal.

343
01:01:06,285 --> 01:01:10,620
By using that thing,
Liz could have left a doorway open.

344
01:01:10,622 --> 01:01:13,526
I'm just asking you to let
her spend a day with my aunt.

345
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:18,428
You've met her.
She's a good person.

346
01:01:19,731 --> 01:01:23,269
She understands things
that others do not.

347
01:01:26,405 --> 01:01:28,775
And I will be there.

348
01:01:41,454 --> 01:01:42,519
They are making a cake.

349
01:01:42,521 --> 01:01:43,720
<i>What did your aunt say?</i>

350
01:01:43,722 --> 01:01:45,722
She's just trying
to get her to relax.

351
01:01:45,724 --> 01:01:47,258
We'll see.

352
01:01:49,896 --> 01:01:51,798
- Norman?
- <i>Yes?</i>

353
01:01:56,635 --> 01:01:59,669
- I'd be sorry if you left.
- <i>Me too.</i>

354
01:01:59,671 --> 01:02:01,407
But I have to look
after Liz.

355
01:02:01,907 --> 01:02:03,110
<i>Okay.</i>

356
01:02:04,709 --> 01:02:05,711
Right.

357
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,582
I'm gonna finish my rounds.

358
01:02:09,948 --> 01:02:11,717
See you soon.

359
01:03:31,997 --> 01:03:33,900
Liz!

360
01:03:39,905 --> 01:03:42,242
<i>Zia! Zia!</i>

361
01:03:42,742 --> 01:03:43,743
<i>Zia!</i>

362
01:03:45,845 --> 01:03:47,611
<i>Zia! Zia!</i>

363
01:03:52,684 --> 01:03:54,520
<i>Zia! Zia!</i>

364
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:00,293
<i>Zia.</i>

365
01:04:01,526 --> 01:04:02,528
<i>Zia.</i>

366
01:04:03,762 --> 01:04:04,764
<i>Zia.</i>

367
01:05:05,057 --> 01:05:06,426
Liz.

368
01:05:07,392 --> 01:05:08,927
It's a rite of purification.

369
01:05:10,528 --> 01:05:11,928
Liz is possessed.

370
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:13,863
She had black magic marks
on her body.

371
01:05:13,865 --> 01:05:15,568
The marks of the witch.

372
01:05:19,671 --> 01:05:21,073
Hello, sweetheart.

373
01:05:21,907 --> 01:05:22,909
Help you?

374
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:25,975
Yes? You wanna go home?

375
01:05:25,977 --> 01:05:27,778
- No. No, don't do it.
- Norman, please.

376
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:30,981
That's enough.
She's terrified.

377
01:05:30,983 --> 01:05:33,753
We are going back
to London, tomorrow.

378
01:05:35,521 --> 01:05:37,720
- Out of my way. Please.
- Please.

379
01:05:37,722 --> 01:05:39,592
- Out of my way.
- I beg you.

380
01:06:12,892 --> 01:06:16,629
Tomorrow, you and I
will go back home.

381
01:06:18,097 --> 01:06:20,066
You will feel...

382
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,434
much better.

383
01:06:27,939 --> 01:06:30,510
I'll get it.

384
01:06:48,593 --> 01:06:51,695
- Hi, Rod.
- <i>Hi! Did you try to call me?</i>

385
01:06:51,697 --> 01:06:53,963
I did.
I need to talk to you.

386
01:06:53,965 --> 01:06:55,401
It's important.

387
01:07:44,048 --> 01:07:45,050
<i>What's that?</i>

388
01:08:09,807 --> 01:08:10,809
Liz?

389
01:08:33,232 --> 01:08:34,234
Liz?

390
01:08:36,568 --> 01:08:38,638
Liz, stay there.

391
01:08:41,607 --> 01:08:42,942
Stay there, Liz.

392
01:08:45,878 --> 01:08:48,180
Not Liz. Peter.

393
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,913
No. No!

394
01:08:50,915 --> 01:08:52,851
Liz!

395
01:09:16,741 --> 01:09:18,110
Liz, hey...

396
01:09:25,284 --> 01:09:26,882
Liz!

397
01:09:26,884 --> 01:09:28,220
Liz!

398
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:57,784
Liz...

399
01:11:21,967 --> 01:11:23,736
Stay still.

400
01:11:26,004 --> 01:11:28,171
I've to get
back to the woods.

401
01:11:28,173 --> 01:11:31,373
- I have to find her.
- You'll never find the way.

402
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:33,142
Dark forces
have been unleashed.

403
01:11:33,144 --> 01:11:34,944
And they will
keep you from it.

404
01:11:34,946 --> 01:11:35,812
What am I supposed to do?

405
01:11:35,814 --> 01:11:37,950
Just accept that
I've lost my daughter?

406
01:11:40,753 --> 01:11:41,754
Diglielo.

407
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:47,794
There is a water tank
at the back.

408
01:11:48,728 --> 01:11:52,028
We have to find Peter's body
and exorcise it.

409
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:54,029
But we must do it tonight.

410
01:11:54,031 --> 01:11:56,533
- Or she'll be lost forever.
- But it's impossible.

411
01:11:56,535 --> 01:11:58,237
It could be anywhere.

412
01:12:09,046 --> 01:12:12,050
Then we must ask
someone who knows...

413
01:12:13,418 --> 01:12:16,986
and this time,
you must believe.

414
01:12:16,988 --> 01:12:18,090
Hm.

415
01:12:21,093 --> 01:12:23,996
Alfredo, I call out to you.

416
01:12:31,804 --> 01:12:32,805
Alfredo...

417
01:12:36,909 --> 01:12:38,177
I call out to you.

418
01:12:49,955 --> 01:12:52,992
Alfredo, are you there?

419
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

420
01:13:48,045 --> 01:13:49,546
<i>Hello, Peter.</i>

421
01:13:49,548 --> 01:13:51,948
<i>I left you some air.</i>

422
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:54,920
<i>More than what
you gave my dog.</i>

423
01:14:29,353 --> 01:14:31,020
I know where he is.

424
01:14:32,325 --> 01:14:35,592
I know where he is,
but he was trying to tell me something.

425
01:14:35,594 --> 01:14:37,129
- Who?
- Alfredo.

426
01:14:45,403 --> 01:14:46,938
It's Peter's mother.

427
01:14:49,006 --> 01:14:50,974
She's the one who took
Liz through the woods.

428
01:14:50,976 --> 01:14:53,112
She was here, in my house.

429
01:14:57,381 --> 01:14:59,919
And my daughter said something
about speaking to Jane.

430
01:15:01,053 --> 01:15:02,153
She wasn't lying.

431
01:15:03,287 --> 01:15:05,254
But it wasn't
her mother she saw,

432
01:15:05,256 --> 01:15:06,659
it was Peter's mother.

433
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:12,964
Liz?

434
01:15:18,437 --> 01:15:19,668
Good evening, Norman.

435
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:21,538
I'm sorry to
bother you so late,

436
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:24,210
- but I'm quite sure that I saw Liz.
- Where?

437
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:26,411
In the woods.

438
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,279
Can I come in?

439
01:15:30,281 --> 01:15:32,414
No! Don't come in, witch!

440
01:15:58,043 --> 01:15:59,245
Amen.

441
01:16:04,782 --> 01:16:07,784
We are safe in the house.

442
01:16:07,786 --> 01:16:12,055
The witch cannot come in
until somebody invites her.

443
01:16:12,057 --> 01:16:15,725
Take the car
and go to the cemetery.

444
01:16:15,727 --> 01:16:19,529
Once there, you will be safe.

445
01:16:19,531 --> 01:16:22,332
The witch cannot walk
on consecrated ground.

446
01:16:22,334 --> 01:16:23,469
And what about you?

447
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:29,207
Don't be afraid, honey.
I'll be fine.

448
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:34,746
You know what to do.

449
01:16:39,116 --> 01:16:40,753
- Thank you, Emma.
- Now go.

450
01:18:18,616 --> 01:18:20,717
Giuseppe.

451
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:23,586
Giuseppe, I want you
to open the gates now.

452
01:18:25,156 --> 01:18:26,855
Open it!

453
01:18:36,367 --> 01:18:37,900
It is fucking locked.

454
01:18:39,737 --> 01:18:41,904
It's all right, Bianca.
It's all right. Don't worry.

455
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:48,377
Shit. Don't look. Don't...

456
01:18:48,379 --> 01:18:50,180
It's all right.

457
01:18:53,617 --> 01:18:56,588
Don't look at him!

458
01:19:21,312 --> 01:19:22,514
Come on. Come on.

459
01:20:17,869 --> 01:20:18,871
Help.

460
01:21:07,719 --> 01:21:11,290
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

461
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:40,101
In the name of the God...

462
01:23:40,103 --> 01:23:41,203
Go away.

463
01:23:50,881 --> 01:23:53,082
We believe in you
and we pray thee,

464
01:23:53,084 --> 01:23:56,485
come be with those who love
and learn to accept your will,

465
01:23:56,487 --> 01:23:58,553
as it is the blessed
Virgin Mary.

466
01:23:58,555 --> 01:24:00,890
Mother of Sorrows,
at the foot of the cross.

467
01:24:00,892 --> 01:24:03,195
The Queen of the Martyrs,
through Christ, our Lord.

468
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,015
O divine light,
urge the evil spirits

469
01:24:26,017 --> 01:24:28,818
to leave us forever
and accept the light.

470
01:24:32,189 --> 01:24:34,660
We believe in you
and we pray thee...

471
01:24:40,264 --> 01:24:42,597
We believe in you
and we pray thee.

472
01:24:42,599 --> 01:24:44,967
Come be with those who love
and learn to accept you.

473
01:24:46,804 --> 01:24:49,038
...Mother of Sorrows,
at the foot of the cross.

474
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,510
We believe in you
and we pray, my God...

475
01:26:03,714 --> 01:26:04,913
Liz.

476
01:26:04,915 --> 01:26:06,382
Liz, wake up, darling.

477
01:26:06,384 --> 01:26:07,819
Please, my love.

478
01:26:08,652 --> 01:26:09,655
Wake up.

479
01:27:28,398 --> 01:27:29,634
Lieutenant.

480
01:27:31,702 --> 01:27:33,804
Why did you not
listen to me, professor?

481
01:27:35,272 --> 01:27:36,842
Why did you not leave?

482
01:27:38,209 --> 01:27:39,941
What do you mean?

483
01:27:39,943 --> 01:27:41,910
You can't kill the dead.

484
01:27:41,912 --> 01:27:43,378
You drove her to him.

485
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:45,980
And now, they'll be
together forever.

486
01:27:45,982 --> 01:27:48,719
Lieutenant, what do you mean?

487
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:40,839
<i>Mom.</i>

488
01:28:46,009 --> 01:28:47,178
<i>Mom.</i>

489
01:28:49,946 --> 01:28:51,348
<i>Help me.</i>

490
01:28:55,318 --> 01:28:56,854
<i>Help me.</i>

491
01:30:21,543 --> 01:30:26,543
