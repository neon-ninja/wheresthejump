1
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,500
It's like this.

2
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,000
We live in claustrophobia,
a land of steel and concrete,

3
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,400
trapped by dark waters.

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,600
There is no escape,
nor do we want it.

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,900
We've come to thrive on it
and each other.

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,600
You can't get the adrenaline pumping
without the terror.

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,300
I love this town.

8
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,400
You've been listening to WGAZ,
the electricity of Manhattan.

9
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,900
This request goes out
to Crystal Lake,

10
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,100
to the senior class of Lakeview High.

11
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,800
That's us!

12
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,100
They'll be graduating
on the 13th of this month

13
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,100
and we wish them the best of luck
and success

14
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,700
when they come to visit
our seductive city.

15
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,300
Our lure is a great one,
young friends, but beware -

16
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,200
the city of lights
casts many shadows indeed.

17
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,800
- I love you.
- I love you.

18
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,700
Got to throw the anchor over.

19
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,500
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

20
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,700
Come on, Jimmy,
something's bothering you.

21
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,100
We're near that summer camp
where all those murders took place.

22
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,400
- What murders?
- You don't want to know.

23
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,600
- Tell me.
- Forget about it, Suzi.

24
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,300
The guy's dead now,
somewhere at the bottom of this lake,

25
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
if you believe the stories.

26
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,600
What stories?

27
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,800
There was this boy
named Jason Voorhees.

28
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,300
He drowned in Crystal Lake
about 30 years ago.

29
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,500
None of the counsellors heard him.

30
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,300
Help!

31
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,600
A bunch of years went by,
everyone forgot about it

32
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,600
and that's when the murders started.

33
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,900
Jason did it?

34
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,600
His mother blamed the counsellors
for her son's death

35
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,200
and she tried to kill them all

36
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,100
but she got her head chopped off
by one of them.

37
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,700
Legend has it that Jason came back
to get even,

38
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,600
vowing to kill every teenager
in the area.

39
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,300
And every now and then,
the murders just start up.

40
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,600
Forget about it,
they're just stories.

41
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,500
CRYSTAL LAKE CAMP.

42
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,700
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

43
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,300
Come on, I'm serious.

44
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,300
All right, I'll go check it out.

45
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,700
Jim?

46
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,500
Stop screwing around. I mean it.

47
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,500
Got you good, Suzi.

48
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,300
All right, so I'm a major ass.

49
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,400
- You'll never do it again?
- Never again.

50
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,700
- Forgive me?
- No.

51
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Jason?

52
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,900
No. Please, no!

53
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,400
Toby's gone awful quiet back there.

54
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Yeah, I guess he's a little nervous
about the trip.

55
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,700
Here.

56
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Go on, open it.

57
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,400
Stephen King supposedly used it
in high school.

58
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,400
I don't know what to say.

59
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,200
Rennie, you are the best student
I have ever had.

60
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,200
You have a real gift.

61
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,200
If there's anybody that can
make use of that pen, it's you.

62
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,700
- Charles.
- Colleen.

63
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
This cruise was your idea

64
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,300
so at the very least
you could show up on time.

65
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,700
- Has everyone checked in?
- No.

66
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,900
Jim Miller and Suzi Donaldson
never showed up

67
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and I'm very concerned.

68
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,500
They probably decided to explore
each other rather than New York.

69
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,700
That's nice. We're running
five minutes late already.

70
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,100
There's someone else coming, too.

71
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,800
You never should've brought her.

72
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,200
It's up to Rennie to decide
what she wants to do.

73
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,800
She doesn't know. She never had
a stable life till she lived with me.

74
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,400
She certainly doesn't have one now.

75
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,700
I'm her legal guardian,
not you or anybody else

76
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,200
and I know what's best for her.
End of discussion.

77
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,300
I think it's just the beginning.

78
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,100
Have you decided on
your departure protocol?

79
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,300
I thought I'd leave that honour
to my son.

80
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
That's not necessary.

81
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,000
Relinquishing command
of the motor vessel Lazarus

82
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,300
to Captain Sean Robertson.

83
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,200
But before you take the helm,
take this.

84
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,100
Something old and something new.

85
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,900
I used that sextant
when I was your age.

86
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Now those goddamn computers
do all the work for you.

87
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Have you decided on
a plan of departure, Captain?

88
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,100
How about we start up the engines
and come around 180 degrees?

89
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,400
Aren't you forgetting something?

90
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Send out
the international maritime signal,

91
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,300
followed by a broadcast

92
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,100
warning other ships
that we are underway.

93
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,700
This voyage is doomed.

94
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,200
Tell me about it.

95
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,600
- Have fun in New York!
- Bye!

96
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,800
LAKEVIEW GRAD CRUISE.

97
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,700
- Rennie.
- Hi, Sean.

98
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,300
I heard you weren't coming.

99
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
We changed our minds.

100
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,400
- I got you a present.
- But I didn't get you one.

101
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,700
Forget it.
It's a dumb little thing anyway.

102
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,900
I love it.

103
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,900
I thought when we got there we
could hike to the top of the statue,

104
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
if you felt like it.

105
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,900
It's supposed to be 22 storeys tall.

106
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That sounds wonderful.

107
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,100
Mr Robertson,
your father was looking for you.

108
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,500
I guess I'll see you later.

109
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,700
What are you doing here?
We've already been through all this.

110
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm sorry, Uncle Charles.
Please don't be upset with me.

111
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,500
I'm not upset, I'm just concerned.

112
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,400
Is this axe awesome or what?

113
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,400
Too cool, JJ.
Your parents really came through.

114
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,300
No lie. I hear there's
this big power room downstairs,

115
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,000
we can get supreme
concert hall echo.

116
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,500
Come down and shoot a basement
tape.

117
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,300
I've got to get some
shockumentary footage first.

118
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,400
Oh, man! Don't tell me you're still
trying to scam on Tamara?

119
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,100
How long have we known each other?

120
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,600
Don't be a dweeb, Wayne.

121
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,900
She's only interested in
what you can do for her.

122
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,300
She is a user.

123
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
She's sexy.

124
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,500
So what? So's this guitar.

125
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,100
I'll talk to you later, all right?

126
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,300
There's a big storm
predicted for tonight.

127
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,300
You're making a big mistake.

128
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,100
It's not too late
to put you back on shore.

129
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,900
If Miss Van Deusen
knew how afraid...

130
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,500
She didn't push me into this.

131
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,500
Why are you doing this to yourself?

132
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,000
I don't even know what I'm afraid of.

133
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,700
I can't even remember
when it started.

134
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,700
Don't you think it's time I found out
and got over it?

135
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,100
Facing your fear
doesn't always conquer it.

136
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,800
I'm staying.

137
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,000
OK.

138
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,000
Man, this place
is aching for a video!

139
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
Wayne, you're an asshole.

140
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,900
So what do you think?

141
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,200
Time for some personal experiences
to fuel our minds?

142
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,900
I agree.

143
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Mommy?

144
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Help! Help me!

145
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Toby!

146
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,000
Is that a muscular bod or what?

147
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,200
He's undefeated, you know that?

148
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,300
Julius is the only senior
I'd even consider doing it with.

149
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,000
He is so good-Iooking.

150
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,700
Gorgeous guy at 10 o'clock.
Look sensual.

151
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,300
I think it's time
for some recreational activity.

152
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,200
Have you seen my niece?

153
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,900
She's motorvating downstairs,
what's the problem?

154
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,200
Senior predictions has started
and she hasn't shown up.

155
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,200
Maybe some of us
don't want our futures predicted.

156
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,100
In your case, I'm sure that's true.

157
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,700
Night-time is the right time.

158
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,700
- No thanks.
- Don't be a lightweight.

159
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,300
If we get caught,
I could lose my science scholarship.

160
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,000
You're talking to the prom queen.
Would I risk getting caught?

161
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,100
- Jesus!
- Have you guys seen my dog?

162
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,700
No, we haven't.
Would you care for a hit?

163
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
No thanks.

164
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Real space cadet.
Wonder if she'll nark on us?

165
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,400
Here, boy!

166
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,800
GAMES ROOM LAZARUS.

167
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,000
Ready to party and then some.

168
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,200
- What are you doing in here?
- Nothing.

169
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,800
Are you girls using drugs?

170
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,200
Do you think I would use drugs,
Mr McCulloch?

171
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,700
We were just exploring the ship.

172
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,700
I'll be coming to your room
in exactly 15 minutes, Miss Mason.

173
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,200
Have your biology project ready
or I'll be phoning your parents.

174
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,800
They're out of town.

175
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,400
I'll make sure that you remain
on board

176
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,300
while your classmates
are out seeing the sights.

177
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,200
- Now what?
- Relax.

178
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,800
I've got McCulloch covered.

179
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,600
That narking bitch niece of his
is a different matter.

180
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Rumour has it she's a teensy bit
afraid of the water.

181
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,500
Nice fight, Julius. I need to work
on my left-right-left combo.

182
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,600
Listen, no hard feelings, OK?

183
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,600
What do you say we track down
those babes?

184
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,800
- So, are you having fun yet?
- Yeah, a lot.

185
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Come on, level with me.

186
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,300
If you can't trust me,
who can you trust?

187
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
It was an accident, I swear.

188
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,900
Stay calm
and grab the life preserver!

189
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,500
I've got you. Come on.

190
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That was truly excellent.

191
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,000
- Let's check out the waiters.
- I think I'll pass.

192
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,100
- What?
- See you later.

193
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,000
Some friend you are.

194
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,600
Come on, grab her hand!

195
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,900
It's OK. Sit down.

196
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Grab her some towels.

197
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,000
She's fine,
just go back to what you were doing.

198
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,600
Care to talk about it?

199
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,900
I can't swim.

200
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,100
No kidding.

201
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,700
Have you thought about
taking lessons?

202
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
It's not that simple.

203
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Good God!

204
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,100
Take it easy, she's all right.

205
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,300
You've done wonderful job
supervising the kids. What happened?

206
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,600
- It wasn't her fault.
- Give me those towels.

207
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,000
You stay away from her. Both of you!

208
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,700
He's come back
and you're all gonna die.

209
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,100
Just leave me alone!

210
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

211
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,100
Help!

212
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,800
The door's open.

213
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,300
I'm in no mood for any more
of your stall tactics.

214
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,700
Where is your final project?

215
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,700
Wouldn't you like
a glass of champagne first, Charles?

216
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,100
Where did you get this?

217
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,100
I packed it just for us.

218
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,200
That's it.

219
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,700
You're not stepping off this ship
until we return home.

220
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,800
I haven't even shown you
my biology project.

221
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,500
What do you think you're doing?

222
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,200
You stop that!

223
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
I mean, really.

224
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,700
Take a closer look, Charles.

225
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,900
I want to make sure I've labelled
all my organs correctly.

226
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,200
Get off of me! I don't believe this.

227
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,800
What do you think you're doing?
I'm your teacher.

228
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,000
Not only are you going home

229
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:37,500
but I will see to it that you spend
next year back in high school.

230
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,800
What is going on?

231
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,400
- Get anything good?
- Very kinky.

232
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,400
- Give me that tape!
- Come and get it.

233
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,200
You're going to be very, very sorry,
young lady.

234
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,200
And as for you, you can forget about
attending any film school.

235
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Ever!

236
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,800
Relax, he's not going to risk
trying a thing.

237
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,200
I guess you're right.

238
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:25,600
Listen, this is going to sound
supremely lame and I know it

239
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,700
but I've had the major hots for you
since our sophomore year.

240
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,300
That's so sweet, Wayne.

241
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,000
And I really would love
to stay and chat

242
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,600
but I really am pressed for time.

243
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,200
- Let's get together later.
- I just thought...

244
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,300
Maybe we could...

245
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,900
Wayne, you're an asshole.

246
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

247
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,500
Let's kick in the stabilizers,
keep the seas off the quarter.

248
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,900
Yes, sir.

249
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,400
These kids are in for
one hell of a storm.

250
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,100
- How old's your boy now?
- 19 months.

251
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,600
Tremendous age.

252
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,000
Take some advice.
Don't push him too hard.

253
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,300
- Take the helm, Jim.
- Certainly, sir.

254
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,800
I'd double-check
those lifeboat stations, too.

255
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,800
My God!

256
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,700
- Can you take us home?
- I'll the Coast Guard for you.

257
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,900
What about you? Are you staying
here?

258
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,200
I'm never going to be
what he wants me to be,

259
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,800
so I guess I'm going with you.

260
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,800
Jesus!

261
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Dad?

262
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,200
Attention everybody.
This is Sean Robertson.

263
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,800
Have you seen JJ? She was supposed
to be down in the power room.

264
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,300
This is an emergency.
Everybody come to the bridge.

265
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,300
What the fuck is this?

266
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,200
Mayday.

267
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,100
Shit.

268
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,100
This is the motor vessel Lazarus.

269
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,900
What's going on?

270
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,500
- Jesus Christ.
- Can anybody out there hear me?

271
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,700
Thank God.

272
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,300
Hello?

273
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Are you there?

274
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,400
I demand to know what is going on!

275
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
Christ.

276
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,900
Where's the radio?

277
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,500
It's dead.

278
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,900
You're all gonna die.

279
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,800
You're the last ones.
He's come back for you.

280
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,600
- What are you talking about?
- Jason Voorhees.

281
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,800
You're insane!
He's been dead for years.

282
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,800
He came down the river
and he got on board.

283
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,400
He walks this ship here and now.

284
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,700
Yes, a killer walks this ship.
And it's certainly none of us!

285
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,100
- Bastard!
- What are you doing?

286
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,600
You're the one who's insane.

287
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,500
That lunatic has been talking about
Jason ever since he came aboard.

288
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,400
- It's no coincidence.
- It doesn't prove he's the one.

289
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,700
Walking corpses are not real.

290
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,200
These dead bodies are real enough.

291
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,800
I say we regroup

292
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and go find this motherfucker
before he finds us!

293
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,700
- Are you with me?
- Watch your mouth!

294
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,700
You'll do no such thing.
I'm in charge here!

295
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,600
School is out, McCulloch. OK?

296
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,600
Let's go.

297
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,300
You come back here!

298
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,500
Christ. Where's Rennie?

299
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,400
She's dropping the anchors.

300
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,700
- You had me worried to death!
- Sean said to drop the anchors.

301
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,300
I'm the one
you should be listening to.

302
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:13,600
Do you think dropping an anchor
in the middle of a storm makes sense?

303
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,700
Come on.

304
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,800
Tamara?
Did you hear the announcement?

305
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,800
We managed to scrounge this up
in game rooms and hallways.

306
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,700
All right, grab what you want.

307
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,400
- What are you taking, Julius?
- Nothing...

308
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,600
...but this gun.

309
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,000
JJ?

310
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,700
Are you down here?

311
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,300
You got a major problem, Wayne.

312
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,700
Shit, I can't see a damn thing.

313
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,100
Did you find Rennie?

314
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,300
She's safe in her room,
no thanks to you.

315
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,400
Have you brought her
back on course yet?

316
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,600
He's doing the best he can.

317
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,400
He's the son of a captain.

318
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,900
He ought to be able to operate
this thing. Do something!

319
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,800
It worked.

320
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,200
- We're back on course.
- Good!

321
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,400
- What's that?
- The fire alarm.

322
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,400
We thought about that. Nobody could
see a flare gun in this storm.

323
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,100
Only one person needs to see it.

324
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,200
I'm gonna find that deck hand.

325
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,600
But what about the fire?

326
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,300
- How do we know there really is one?
- What?

327
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,400
Use some common sense.

328
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,900
Setting off
a fire alarm causes panic,

329
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,900
the same panic caused by suggesting
Jason is alive and on this ship.

330
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,200
Enough is enough.

331
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,400
Help me!

332
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,800
I don't understand
what's happening to me.

333
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,300
- What is that?
- The power room.

334
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:44,100
Listen. I want you to stay here
until I get back with the others.

335
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,200
Understand?

336
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

337
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,700
Water's got into the engine circuit.

338
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,400
ENGINE ROOM.

339
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,700
We have to get everybody
off the ship!

340
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,400
Quick! Dive!

341
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,900
What the hell? Let go of her!

342
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,500
She shouldn't be on this ship!
It's all your fault!

343
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,700
- It's Jason's fault.
- Not another word, you hear?

344
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,400
No, I don't!

345
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,300
You listen to me
if you want off this ship alive.

346
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,700
Thank God.
I just lowered the lifeboat.

347
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,000
We have to go.

348
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,100
Wait! I left the others
in the restaurant.

349
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,300
There is no more restaurant.

350
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,300
Come on.

351
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,300
Get back!

352
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,300
Son of a bitch!

353
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,000
Come on.

354
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,600
Hurry up!

355
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,300
Start rowing!

356
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,400
Come on!

357
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,300
Keep rowing!

358
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,700
I hope you can find shore soon,
Captain.

359
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,600
We don't want to drown out here.

360
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,600
Do you have any idea where we are,
Sean?

361
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,400
Come on, man. I made it, so can you.

362
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,600
All right, man.

363
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,200
Hey, man. Wake up!

364
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,200
Shit! Check it out!

365
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,400
Damn! We're in New York! You did it!

366
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,800
We are in New York! New York City!

367
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,800
I don't believe it, we made it!

368
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,900
There must be a phone around here.

369
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,100
Wonderful choice of places
to dock a boat, Mr Robertson.

370
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,600
Wonderful.

371
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,100
- I can't believe we made it.
- Or that we're alive.

372
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,200
We are all very lucky.

373
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:21,600
- Give me your money.
- Give him the money. Now!

374
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,400
Here.

375
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,400
Got some good shit here.

376
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,900
You got that right.

377
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,400
Give me your wallet.

378
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,500
- Ain't that sweet.
- Bastard!

379
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,900
Go ahead Superman, be a hero.

380
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:57,400
- Come on, now.
- Got a problem, Dad?

381
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:13,700
- Please don't hurt her.
- Miss Princess?

382
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,100
Would I do that?

383
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,300
You look like a real party girl.

384
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,000
Want to go on a date
with me and my friend?

385
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,700
If you're free, that is.

386
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:34,000
Follow us,
we'll blow her fucking head off.

387
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,200
Are we just going to stand here?
Let's go.

388
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:43,900
Julius! Calm down, will you?
You heard him, they'll kill her!

389
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,500
We have to find the police!

390
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:53,700
I think it'll be more productive
if we split up.

391
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,000
No discussions now, please!

392
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:23,100
Help! Stop it! Somebody help me!

393
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,400
Shut the fuck up!

394
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,200
Welcome to the Casbah, princess.

395
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,300
Please, don't hurt me.

396
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:46,200
Loosen up, baby. You'll feel
way better if you're stoned.

397
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:58,900
Better sling her some more caine.
We only got a half load here.

398
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:01,500
We're in for a long night.

399
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,200
It's your parade, princess.

400
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,600
It can be smooth, it can be rough.

401
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,700
It's your choice.

402
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,200
Come on, baby. Lay back and enjoy it.

403
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,000
I think I'm in love.

404
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,600
Forgot my money, homes.

405
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,900
Who the fuck are you?

406
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,300
You're dead, fuckhead.

407
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:14,500
Come on. Operator, this is
an emergency, get me the police.

408
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:59,300
Use the combos, keep the feet light.
This is it.

409
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,600
Take your best shot.

410
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,800
Motherfucker.

411
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:25,400
- What did they do to you?
- He's here.

412
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,800
Jason is here.

413
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,400
We have to find the others now.

414
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,800
- Freeze!
- It's OK, she's with me.

415
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,800
My apologies, miss.
Are you all right?

416
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,500
Thank God.

417
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,600
Are you OK?

418
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,100
Mr McCulloch,
Jason is here in New York.

419
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:19,600
- Rennie saw him.
- Just shut up about Jason.

420
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:22,000
Is it true?

421
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:32,500
I find it a tall tale indeed
but you seem honest

422
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,900
so I kind of believe
some of what you say.

423
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,500
First we need to find Julius.

424
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,800
I'm sure he'll pop up.
I'll call for back-up.

425
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:55,100
Dispatch!

426
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,900
Hold it! What are you doing?

427
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,900
For God's sake, Rennie, slow down!

428
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,500
Quickly! Let's move!

429
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:03,300
Miss Van Deusen!

430
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,800
It's so pretty today.

431
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,500
Perfect day for swimming.

432
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:23,900
You've been coming out here
every summer for three years

433
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:27,000
and you still haven't learned
how to swim.

434
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,700
I'll take some lessons this time.
I promise.

435
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,200
That's what you said last year.

436
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,900
I think the time has come
for your first swimming lesson.

437
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:48,100
You don't want to end up drowning
like that Voorhees boy, do you?

438
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,800
He never learned how to swim, either.

439
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,300
He's still in the bottom
of this lake.

440
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,300
- He is not.
- He is.

441
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:04,500
And he's ready to pull down
anybody who falls in and can't swim.

442
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,900
You're telling a lie.

443
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,600
Am I? Let's find out.

444
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:21,200
Better swim, Rennie,
before Jason pulls you down.

445
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,400
- I can't!
- You can and you will!

446
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,200
Come on! Swim!

447
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,000
You pushed me into the lake.

448
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,500
I was only trying to teach you.

449
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:26,100
You almost killed me.
I was drowning!

450
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:30,100
I pulled you out, I saved your life!

451
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,100
You son of a bitch!

452
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,700
He was down there.

453
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,600
Just keep away from her!

454
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,700
You! It's not possible!

455
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,300
Please!

456
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:54,400
I'm begging you! Please!

457
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,100
I was at school when they told me.

458
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:52,400
Rennie, your parents died
in a car accident.

459
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:00,500
It seems like
everybody I care about I lose.

460
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,000
That won't happen this time.

461
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

462
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,000
Help!

463
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,600
EMERGENCY BRAKE
$100 FINE FOR UNLAWFUL USE

464
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,800
Is this my stop?

465
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,200
Get it moving!

466
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,800
DANGER 6000 VOLTS.

467
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:26,100
SUBWAY.

468
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:23,100
It's over.

469
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,100
- Somebody please...
- Let's go!

470
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,600
You are dead meat, slimebag!

471
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,700
Yo, man. It's cool.

472
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,600
Di's Diner.

473
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:50,700
- We're open till 3am like always.
- We've got to call the police.

474
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,200
There's a payphone in back
but it's broke.

475
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:58,900
Look, you don't understand,
a maniac is trying to kill us.

476
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,400
Welcome to New York.

477
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:18,300
Son of a bitch.

478
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,400
Come on!

479
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,100
Come on!

480
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,300
What are you kids doing down here?

481
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:31,300
- Can you help us get out?
- We haven't got a man to spare.

482
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,000
- What do you mean?
- Toxic waste.

483
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:38,800
The sewer floods with the stuff
at midnight, ten minutes from now.

484
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,700
Follow me.

485
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,800
You didn't get me in the lake

486
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,900
and you're not gonna get me now!

487
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,900
DANGER
TOXIC
CHEMICALS.

488
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:45,700
Get up!

489
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:52,300
Get up!

490
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,600
Go!

491
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,200
Run!

492
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:41,300
Mommy! Don't let me drown!

493
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,700
Help!

494
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:44,300
I hear there's a statue here
that's 22 storeys tall.

495
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,000
Toby!
