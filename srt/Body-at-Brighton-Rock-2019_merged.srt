00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,996
<i>Now, onto trail conditions,</i>

3
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,732
we've got another cold front
coming across Truman county

4
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,699
for the next few days,
onto the weekend.

5
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:45,669
Temperature drops overnight
can hit 25 degrees.

6
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,975
<i>Make sure to carry
with you extra water</i>

7
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:54,443
and be prepared for an increase
in frostbite related calls.

8
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:56,980
Stay safe.
Stay warm out there.

9
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:11,962
If you see any hikers out there,

10
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:14,031
walk them through
our standard precautions.

11
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:24,776
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

12
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:26,742
We'll be moving
the public waiting line

13
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:29,645
for the Botany exhibit indoors
through the rest of the week.

14
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:04,915
Hey.

15
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:07,117
- Honey.
- Mm-hmm.

16
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:09,885
<i>There has also been
an increase in bear</i>

17
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:12,654
and mountain lion sightings
in the upper west end trails.

18
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,522
As winter's setting in,
they're coming down the mountain

19
00:03:14,524 --> 00:03:17,058
looking for food.
You don't want to be that food,

20
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,560
especially those of you
heading down the back country.

21
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:21,664
Okay, we're gonna do
a roll call.

22
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:24,565
Just give me a here people
and we can get this wrapped up.

23
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:26,535
Oh, and no trades day of shift.

24
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:29,536
It's getting too confusing
for the office to keep up.

25
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:31,540
- Okay, Adam.
- Here.

26
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:33,676
- Craig.
- Here.

27
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,776
- Daniel.
- Here.

28
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:37,678
- Davey.
- Here!

29
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,214
- Chip.
- Where have you been?

30
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:41,249
My car broke down,
I missed the bus again.

31
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:42,952
- Maya.
- Um, present.

32
00:03:43,386 --> 00:03:47,520
Oh, Ms. McHolmes,
how nice of you to join us.

33
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:49,223
Maybe you wanna tell us what uh,

34
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,125
whatever tale seems to be
so much more important

35
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:53,594
- than my morning minutes.
- Um...

36
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:55,695
Actually, you know what?
Why don't you come on up here

37
00:03:55,697 --> 00:03:57,666
and do it for me,
and then I can sit down?

38
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,101
Um, no ma'am,
you're doing great.

39
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:04,606
I mean, uh, I didn't mean, uh...
I mean...

40
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,574
Remember people,
to be early is to be on time.

41
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,943
If you are not checked in

42
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:12,211
at the beginning
of my safety meeting,

43
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:14,814
minutes will be deducted
from your timecard.

44
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:16,216
For those of you
who haven't checked yet,

45
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:17,351
your assignments
are on the board

46
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:20,219
and assignment packets
can be found in the eagle rooms.

47
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:21,890
Stay safe out there!

48
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,525
Stay safe out there!

49
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:32,766
So, do you, uh,
know where you're at yet?

50
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:35,602
- Nah, I gotta check.
- I'm at exhibits with Chip.

51
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,769
Been after that guy for a week.

52
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:41,040
Just look at his face.
It's... It's so...

53
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:43,243
- Frat boy?
- Yes! Bing! Love it.

54
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:45,277
Oh, looks like
you're not the only one.

55
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,477
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.

56
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,614
She's been bird-dogging everyone
I even glance at recently.

57
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:50,582
Let's get her.

58
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:52,751
Wendy, you really
stepped in it this time.

59
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:54,152
Are you trying to get fired?

60
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:55,720
What? What do you mean?

61
00:04:55,722 --> 00:04:57,289
I was being sincere!

62
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,257
Just, you know,
the one time I'm late.

63
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:00,593
Oh!

64
00:05:01,328 --> 00:05:02,660
What?

65
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:04,098
Girl, you are late all the time.

66
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:05,997
Come on, I'm not always late.

67
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:08,032
It's adorable
that you think that.

68
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:10,634
Uh-oh.
You're not on exhibits today.

69
00:05:10,636 --> 00:05:13,004
You're, uh, posting signs
on Hitchback Ridge.

70
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:15,873
What? No, no, no, no.
I'm supposed to be on exhibits

71
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,942
- flirting with a quarterback!
- Nope.

72
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:20,813
I'm on exhibits, you guys
need to stop reading this wrong.

73
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:24,117
- Um, Craigy.
- No.

74
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:26,917
- Craigy.
- I'm not switching with you.

75
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:29,919
I can do it.
Yeah, you take the info booth

76
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:31,556
and I'll take the trail
and then...

77
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,558
That way you get to see Chip
all day.

78
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:35,794
Hmm.

79
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:37,964
I know that face.

80
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,331
Yeah, that's your pity face.

81
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,665
- No!
- It so is.

82
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,801
- I'll handle this for you.
- Thank you.

83
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,039
Maya doesn't think
that you can do it.

84
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:50,776
I'm just as qualified
as you guys.

85
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:54,044
Yeah, don't you mostly do
like kiddie trails?

86
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:55,945
What about the, uh, spider
that made you jump...

87
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:57,814
- Oh, my God.
- ...15 feet across the way?

88
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,817
You guys it was a black widow!

89
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:01,384
- It was a daddy long leg.
- It was a daddy long leg.

90
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:03,086
So, I don't want you
to get in your head

91
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:05,321
- about this though, it's okay.
- It's not a big deal.

92
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,855
It's just that
being on the trail,

93
00:06:06,857 --> 00:06:08,057
you kinda have to be,
like, tougher.

94
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:10,959
- Yeah, hardy. Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Hardy is a great word.

95
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:14,964
Uh-hmm. Come on you guys,
it's just tying signs to trees.

96
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:16,866
No, it's a lot of rough terrain.

97
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:19,168
And you have to be ready
to get your hands dirty,

98
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,237
your pretty hands.

99
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:23,972
Listen, you're an indoor kid,
okay?

100
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:26,842
- Like, uh, Davey.
- Oh!

101
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,613
- Oh, Davey?
- Oh, Davey.

102
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:32,981
- We're trading.
- Wow, okay.

103
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:35,853
All right, okay, fine,
your... your funeral babe!

104
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,887
- Thanks, Davey.
- All right, calm down...

105
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,989
Uh, let's switch packs, yeah?

106
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:42,723
So, you don't have to go
through outfitting.

107
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:43,893
Yeah.

108
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:48,097
Here ya go, and, um,
you're sure you're okay, yeah?

109
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:49,998
Yeah, I'm fine.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,302
- Okay.
- I'll be fine.

111
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:54,135
Great, I will see you later.

112
00:06:54,137 --> 00:06:56,270
Yeah, it's just
a walk in the woods.

113
00:06:56,272 --> 00:06:58,007
I mean, how hard can it be?

114
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:17,333
Jesus Christ, Davey.
You scared the shit out of me!

115
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:20,068
It's not my fault,
I called your name three times.

116
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,238
You didn't look up!

117
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:23,638
Oh, I'm sorry. Lemme help you.

118
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- It's fine
- Oh, nope, okay.
It's fine. I've got it. Thanks.
What are you doing out here?

119
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:35,085
I'm refilling
the dog shit bag holders.

120
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:41,424
All the way out here?

121
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,390
Not usually.

122
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,428
Usually, I work
with the maintenance crew,

123
00:10:45,796 --> 00:10:47,662
helping them
with electric stuff.

124
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:50,931
- Hmm.
- But I left the gate open

125
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,933
and one of the mowers
rolled down the hill

126
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,268
right into a maintenance shack

127
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,139
so, now I'm on
dog shit bag duty.

128
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,509
Yeah.

129
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,484
Do you ever feel like...

130
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:12,119
I don't know, this isn't
the right job for you?

131
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,121
No, I mean,

132
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:16,525
I may not be the biggest guy
in the crew.

133
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,994
They may not think
I'm the best person for the job,

134
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,263
but I know I can do it.

135
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:24,432
That's what matters, right?

136
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:28,103
Yeah.

137
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:32,374
Well uh...

138
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:35,708
I guess I'm gonna, you know...

139
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,110
get back to it.

140
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:38,444
Okay, right yeah.

141
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:39,581
See ya!

142
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:43,283
Hey!

143
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:46,454
I could come with you!
If you want.

144
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:50,123
To make up for messing up
half your stuff.

145
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,024
- I'm pretty much done.
- No, it's okay.

146
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:54,361
It's just less work
for me now, so...

147
00:11:54,928 --> 00:11:57,598
Right, right.
I should probably go too.

148
00:11:58,365 --> 00:11:59,900
All right, see ya!

149
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:02,033
Watch out for snakes!

150
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:06,038
Okay, I will.

151
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:51,841
Here.

152
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,662
So...

153
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:14,565
let's see.

154
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,333
Okay. So, I'm here.

155
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,824
I can make it up there.

156
00:15:19,393 --> 00:15:20,461
You lost yet?

157
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:08,257
Yes.

158
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:42,557
Okay.

159
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,863
What's she talking about?

160
00:19:58,865 --> 00:19:59,966
I'm here.

161
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,185
What?

162
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:44,600
Okay. Let's get back here.

163
00:22:07,155 --> 00:22:08,256
Oh, shit.

164
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:52,067
Hey!

165
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:53,767
Hello!

166
00:22:54,368 --> 00:22:56,237
Are you okay down there?

167
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:01,976
Hello?

168
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:09,783
No, no.

169
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,120
Shit!

170
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:22,228
Okay.

171
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:26,666
Okay. Okay.

172
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,874
Hello?

173
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:19,181
I, uh...

174
00:24:19,183 --> 00:24:21,052
I... I work for the park.

175
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,770
Sir?

176
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Sir.

177
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:50,739
Okay.

178
00:25:59,548 --> 00:26:01,849
Come in, this is Wendy McHolmes,

179
00:26:02,384 --> 00:26:04,886
is anyone there?
Please, come in.

180
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:12,827
I've... I've got a code 030.

181
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:16,997
Repeat I have a code 030, over.

182
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:23,137
I have a dead fucking body here.

183
00:26:27,442 --> 00:26:29,441
<i>This is APAC Kevin
at base, over.</i>

184
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:32,143
Oh, God.
Hi, this is Wendy McHolmes.

185
00:26:32,145 --> 00:26:35,180
I'm on Hitchback
just over the peak

186
00:26:35,182 --> 00:26:38,284
and, um, I have got a code 030.

187
00:26:38,286 --> 00:26:41,019
<i>You're breaking up Wendy,
can you repeat?</i>

188
00:26:41,021 --> 00:26:42,921
Um, there's a man,

189
00:26:42,923 --> 00:26:45,993
I... I think
he must have fell, um...

190
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:47,861
<i>Switch to channel three.</i>

191
00:26:48,428 --> 00:26:49,429
Okay.

192
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:54,299
Okay, channel three here.

193
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:56,201
<i>Are you sure he is 030?</i>

194
00:26:56,203 --> 00:26:57,901
<i>You checked all his
vital signs?</i>

195
00:26:57,903 --> 00:26:59,904
Yes, yeah, yes definitely.

196
00:26:59,906 --> 00:27:02,574
Um, he looks like
he's been here,

197
00:27:02,576 --> 00:27:05,476
um, I don't know. He looks like
he's been here a while,

198
00:27:05,478 --> 00:27:07,446
um, like a couple of days maybe.

199
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:11,316
<i>Wendy we don't show you
on any trails today,</i>

200
00:27:11,318 --> 00:27:13,953
<i>you don't have that level
of trail clearance yet.</i>

201
00:27:14,454 --> 00:27:18,155
Yeah, um, I traded
with Maya Davis earlier

202
00:27:18,157 --> 00:27:20,459
and, um, she had Hitchback.

203
00:27:22,094 --> 00:27:23,095
Fuck!

204
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,965
Actually,
I'm not actually on Hitchback.

205
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:29,167
I don't think.

206
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:31,934
Um, I don't have my map.

207
00:27:31,936 --> 00:27:34,873
And I must have lost it
a while back on the trail.

208
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:38,175
<i>Copy that,
okay now Wendy.</i>

209
00:27:38,177 --> 00:27:40,812
<i>Are there any distinguishable
landmarks you can see?</i>

210
00:27:43,915 --> 00:27:45,183
Um...

211
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:50,188
yes, yeah, I can... I can see
Brighton Rock, uh, just...

212
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:52,488
just across the valley.

213
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,956
<i>Okay copy,
see anything else?</i>

214
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,759
Uh, I'm on a ridge,

215
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:58,628
just a big flat spot.

216
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,463
<i>That'll be a good place
for you to be</i>

217
00:28:00,465 --> 00:28:01,366
<i>when the search team arrives.</i>

218
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,399
<i>Now, is anyone else there?
Is anyone else hurt?</i>

219
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:08,371
No. It's just me and him,
I mean the body.

220
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:10,542
There's, uh,
there's no one else up here.

221
00:28:11,276 --> 00:28:13,543
<i>Listen, it's a long ridge
around Brighton</i>

222
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:15,545
<i>but we'll reach out
to the fire lookout station</i>

223
00:28:15,547 --> 00:28:17,346
<i>and the proper authorities.</i>

224
00:28:17,348 --> 00:28:18,349
<i>Be careful up there,</i>

225
00:28:18,582 --> 00:28:20,282
<i>that area has active
wildlife warnings</i>

226
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:21,950
<i>and category three terrain.</i>

227
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,519
<i>It might take us a while
to find you</i>

228
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:25,087
<i>without an exact location,</i>

229
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:27,858
<i>just secure the area
and hold tight.</i>

230
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:29,626
Okay, um...

231
00:28:30,227 --> 00:28:33,995
do I leave a sign
or tie a t-shirt to a tree?

232
00:28:33,997 --> 00:28:36,400
I mean, what... I mean,
what... what do we do now?

233
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:39,034
<i>As I said,
a park official</i>

234
00:28:39,036 --> 00:28:40,501
<i>must secure the area</i>

235
00:28:40,503 --> 00:28:42,573
<i>and you're a long ways
out there.</i>

236
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:47,141
Are the fire lookout people
gonna be here soon at least?

237
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,513
Is... is anyone
gonna be here soon?

238
00:28:50,214 --> 00:28:53,447
<i>The area you're in
is about six hours from base.</i>

239
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:54,715
<i>It's 16:00 now,</i>

240
00:28:54,717 --> 00:28:56,652
<i>they're not gonna get to you
before dark.</i>

241
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,153
That's... That's not
until midnight now.

242
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,155
I have to stay here until then?

243
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:03,658
<i>No, Wendy. You need
to stay until morning.</i>

244
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,560
<i>Every ranger pack is equipped
for these types of emergencies.</i>

245
00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:08,129
<i>You should be fine
for one night.</i>

246
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:10,131
No fucking way,
are you out of your mind?

247
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,466
I'm not staying here
with a dead body!

248
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:14,568
<i>Look without an
exact pinpoint location,</i>

249
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:17,003
<i>you shouldn't move
from where you are at all</i>

250
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,706
<i>until we can send someone
up there safely</i>

251
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:21,074
<i>and that unfortunately
won't be until morning.</i>

252
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:27,350
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

253
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:29,017
Shit.

254
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,322
<i>Wendy?
Wendy! It's Sandra.</i>

255
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:38,224
<i>Listen, someone has to stay
until the first responders</i>

256
00:29:38,226 --> 00:29:39,327
<i>can get to the scene.</i>

257
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:42,094
<i>They can't get up there
in the dark for extraction,</i>

258
00:29:42,096 --> 00:29:43,265
<i>it isn't safe.</i>

259
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:45,933
And me staying here is?

260
00:29:46,134 --> 00:29:48,001
<i>Well, it's safer than
you trying to come down</i>

261
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,102
<i>in the dark
without even knowing</i>

262
00:29:49,104 --> 00:29:50,272
<i>where you are in the daylight.</i>

263
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:52,438
<i>There's miles and miles</i>

264
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,074
<i>of unmaintained woods
up there, Wendy.</i>

265
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:57,378
<i>You could get lost
and we'd never find you ever.</i>

266
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,045
But I'm not a forest, uh...

267
00:30:00,047 --> 00:30:03,081
service official or certified,
whatever.

268
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,083
And anyway,
I'm like a park guide, you know,

269
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:07,653
like, I like pick up trash
and I like hand out pamphlets

270
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:11,056
and I tell kids not to start
forest fires, I'm not...

271
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:12,759
<i>Someone has to stay
and trust me,</i>

272
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:14,228
<i>I'm sorry that's you.</i>

273
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:17,228
<i>They know the vicinity
you're in,</i>

274
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,730
<i>just, just stay put.</i>

275
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:21,968
<i>Tough it out and we'll be there
as soon as we can.</i>

276
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:31,777
<i>And Wendy, you didn't touch
or move the deceased, did you?</i>

277
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:36,249
No.

278
00:30:36,684 --> 00:30:39,420
<i>Good.
That's really good.</i>

279
00:30:40,753 --> 00:30:42,487
<i>Whatever you do,
make sure that you...</i>

280
00:30:43,656 --> 00:30:46,392
Fuck!

281
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:49,262
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
No, no, no, no.

282
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:53,533
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

283
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:57,435
Fuck!

284
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:02,139
Fuck!

285
00:31:58,296 --> 00:31:59,363
Hello?

286
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:05,235
Anybody in there?

287
00:32:22,218 --> 00:32:24,387
I'm an employee
with the park service.

288
00:32:32,796 --> 00:32:34,364
You know it's, uh...

289
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:37,233
it's illegal not to answer
a park employee.

290
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

291
00:38:11,224 --> 00:38:12,592
Oh, my God!

292
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,561
Hey, hey are you okay?

293
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,983
Shit, what do I do?

294
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:41,485
Oh, fuck!

295
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:50,462
Fuck.

296
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,701
Fuck! Wait till dawn.

297
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:01,740
Oh, shit. Wait till dawn.

298
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:04,241
Okay.

299
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,260
Okay.

300
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Okay. Okay, so...
okay, so...
Okay.

301
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:49,817
Okay.

302
00:41:18,738 --> 00:41:19,840
Anybody in there?

303
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

304
00:42:26,372 --> 00:42:28,104
Come in.
This is Wendy again

305
00:42:28,106 --> 00:42:29,941
to office or Kevin.

306
00:42:31,476 --> 00:42:33,945
Come in.
My radio is dying. Hello.

307
00:42:34,913 --> 00:42:37,349
Come on.

308
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:45,924
Come in.

309
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:48,226
Shit.

310
00:43:05,409 --> 00:43:08,111
Ugh, yes! Oh.

311
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,248
Hello, this is Wendy
to main station, over.

312
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,849
<i>There ya are!
How ya doing out there?</i>

313
00:43:14,851 --> 00:43:16,884
<i>Have you secured the area?
Anything to report?</i>

314
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:20,121
Um, I found a tent
about half a mile from the body.

315
00:43:20,123 --> 00:43:22,524
But it didn't look like anyone
had been there in a while.

316
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:24,492
<i>Copy.
Did you find anything else?</i>

317
00:43:24,494 --> 00:43:26,995
I thought there might have been
something in the tent

318
00:43:26,997 --> 00:43:29,129
so I went in there
to check if...

319
00:43:29,131 --> 00:43:31,131
<i>Wait! You went inside the tent?</i>

320
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:33,100
<i>That could be a crime scene.</i>

321
00:43:33,102 --> 00:43:34,504
<i>You should not have done that.</i>

322
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:38,273
Well I was just... I was just
checking to see if there...

323
00:43:38,275 --> 00:43:41,844
if there was someone hurt or
if there was someone in there.

324
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,511
<i>Look, I know
this might be hard for you,</i>

325
00:43:44,513 --> 00:43:46,914
<i>but you might have just
contaminated evidence.</i>

326
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,184
Evidence of what?

327
00:43:48,818 --> 00:43:50,918
<i>Well, they probably just fell,</i>

328
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,919
<i>nine times out of ten,
that's the cause of death</i>

329
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,556
<i>out here, and it sounds like
that from what you've described</i>

330
00:43:55,558 --> 00:43:57,424
<i>but that's why the coroner
needs to come</i>

331
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,027
<i>so just don't touch
anything else, okay?</i>

332
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:02,263
<i>In the morning, you should
get back up on that ridge</i>

333
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,130
<i>so the search team
can spot you.</i>

334
00:44:04,132 --> 00:44:05,531
<i>The team is gonna start...</i>

335
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:07,536
<i>...a little before dark, copy?</i>

336
00:44:10,205 --> 00:44:11,773
There's someone here.

337
00:44:12,308 --> 00:44:14,208
<i>What do you mean,
like another hiker?</i>

338
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,209
No, there's just a man.
He's just...

339
00:44:16,211 --> 00:44:18,213
he's just standing
over the dead body.

340
00:44:18,713 --> 00:44:20,313
<i>Well, go tell him to back off.</i>

341
00:44:20,315 --> 00:44:22,050
<i>That's the whole reason
you're there.</i>

342
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:25,184
You just told me that
there might be a crime scene

343
00:44:25,186 --> 00:44:27,188
and that means that he might be
a murderer!

344
00:44:29,023 --> 00:44:30,155
Shit!

345
00:44:30,157 --> 00:44:31,191
No.

346
00:45:01,322 --> 00:45:02,456
Shit.

347
00:46:03,248 --> 00:46:05,180
You're with the park?

348
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:07,285
Whoa, whoa! It's okay.
It's okay.

349
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:10,387
You're okay, okay?

350
00:46:10,389 --> 00:46:12,157
What were you doing?
You shouldn't be here.

351
00:46:13,425 --> 00:46:15,125
I've been coming up here
for years.

352
00:46:15,127 --> 00:46:16,558
No, I don't mean the woods.

353
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,064
I... I mean, right there.
There's been an accident.

354
00:46:20,297 --> 00:46:21,433
Who is he?

355
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,568
I don't know, a hiker.

356
00:46:24,101 --> 00:46:25,835
The police are on their way.

357
00:46:25,837 --> 00:46:27,139
When are they getting here?

358
00:46:27,605 --> 00:46:28,905
Soon.

359
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:33,677
Hey!

360
00:46:34,713 --> 00:46:35,680
Hey!

361
00:46:39,183 --> 00:46:41,583
Stop! You really need to leave.

362
00:46:41,585 --> 00:46:42,952
This is a crime scene.

363
00:46:43,454 --> 00:46:45,054
I thought you said
it was an accident.

364
00:46:47,024 --> 00:46:48,492
Maybe. Maybe not.

365
00:46:48,993 --> 00:46:50,528
That's why you need to leave.

366
00:46:52,061 --> 00:46:53,461
Hey, what are you doing?

367
00:46:53,463 --> 00:46:55,731
You're gonna contaminate
the... the remains.

368
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:57,434
Oh, I don't think
he's gonna mind.

369
00:47:00,604 --> 00:47:01,705
I said stop.

370
00:47:03,606 --> 00:47:05,442
Stay, right there.

371
00:47:06,543 --> 00:47:07,610
Which one is it?

372
00:47:07,844 --> 00:47:09,679
You want me to stay right here
or go away?

373
00:47:10,013 --> 00:47:11,281
I can't do both.

374
00:47:18,488 --> 00:47:19,955
What were you looking for?

375
00:47:21,357 --> 00:47:23,460
Look,
I know what a fall looks like.

376
00:47:23,793 --> 00:47:26,095
Broken neck, broken bones,

377
00:47:26,996 --> 00:47:29,729
and this just... this just
doesn't look like that

378
00:47:29,731 --> 00:47:31,668
or at least not just that.

379
00:47:32,568 --> 00:47:34,336
What does it look like then?

380
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:37,507
I don't know. That's what
I was trying to figure out.

381
00:47:38,073 --> 00:47:40,373
I was looking for a wallet
or ID or something,

382
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:41,543
but he's got nothing on him.

383
00:47:41,877 --> 00:47:44,012
But I did feel...

384
00:47:48,417 --> 00:47:49,384
Hah!

385
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,386
That thing doesn't still work,
does it?

386
00:47:54,388 --> 00:47:55,390
Nah, it's dead.

387
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,258
I got one just like it.

388
00:47:57,826 --> 00:48:00,393
Oh, you've got a phone?

389
00:48:00,395 --> 00:48:01,763
Ah, not on me.

390
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,598
I think I left it at home.

391
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,533
Always have that damn thing
with me, you know?

392
00:48:05,868 --> 00:48:07,299
It isn't safe to be up here

393
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,536
without a means
of communication.

394
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:10,672
You know?

395
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,042
When did you say
help was coming?

396
00:48:16,377 --> 00:48:17,278
Soon.

397
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:23,050
Yeah, well, getting dark
pretty soon.

398
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,687
- Yeah, they'll be here soon.
- Hmm.

399
00:48:29,456 --> 00:48:31,191
Lotta big critters up here.

400
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,129
Actually, I'm surprised
they haven't gotten to him yet.

401
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,299
In fact,

402
00:48:39,566 --> 00:48:40,567
kinda...

403
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:44,569
As a forest service marshal,

404
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:46,337
I'm gonna have to request
that you vacate

405
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:48,174
the premises immediately.

406
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,175
- Look.
- Go on.

407
00:48:52,177 --> 00:48:53,611
I'm just trying to help,
all right?

408
00:48:53,613 --> 00:48:55,313
Now, if you wanna stay up here
all night,

409
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:57,450
sit in the dark with a cadaver,
that's your own damn business.

410
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,718
But I'm telling you,
this is not the kind of place

411
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,188
you want to be at night.

412
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:05,157
Especially
a little thing like you.

413
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,193
Lotta predators up here.

414
00:49:08,762 --> 00:49:11,161
If you find yourself
face-to-face with one,

415
00:49:11,163 --> 00:49:12,197
don't run.

416
00:49:13,132 --> 00:49:15,367
You're still a couple notches
down on the food chain.

417
00:49:16,335 --> 00:49:17,336
Remember that.

418
00:49:20,205 --> 00:49:22,608
Have a good night, marshal.

419
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

420
00:53:29,848 --> 00:53:31,016
What the fuck.

421
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,325
Shit.

422
00:53:50,702 --> 00:53:51,836
This is...

423
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:12,906
Oh, God.

424
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:17,110
What the fuck.

425
00:56:43,302 --> 00:56:44,636
Okay.

426
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:58,516
Hello.

427
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:21,706
Is anybody there?

428
00:59:07,876 --> 00:59:08,943
Hmm.

429
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,228
Okay.

430
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

431
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>Wendy?</i>

432
01:06:12,588 --> 01:06:13,522
<i>Wendy?</i>

433
01:06:16,291 --> 01:06:19,592
<i>you just
have to be tougher...</i>

434
01:06:19,594 --> 01:06:21,362
<i>tougher... tougher.</i>

435
01:06:21,696 --> 01:06:24,198
<i>Maya doesn't think
that you could do it.</i>

436
01:06:25,768 --> 01:06:28,000
<i>If you get lost,
we'd never find you...</i>

437
01:06:28,002 --> 01:06:29,468
<i>find you... find you...</i>

438
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:31,673
<i>You aren't ready for this.</i>

439
01:06:32,006 --> 01:06:33,708
<i>Ever. Ever.</i>

440
01:06:34,709 --> 01:06:37,376
<i>And you have to be willing
to get your hands dirty,</i>

441
01:06:37,378 --> 01:06:39,477
<i>to jump 15 feet across the way.</i>

442
01:06:39,479 --> 01:06:41,781
<i>You mostly do like
kiddie trails, right?</i>

443
01:06:48,923 --> 01:06:50,524
<i>I'm sorry that it's you.</i>

444
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:52,459
<i>That it's you. That it's you.</i>

445
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:06,773
Ha.

446
01:07:07,474 --> 01:07:08,508
Ha!

447
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

448
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:01,001
You're just cells
and tissues and atoms

449
01:11:01,235 --> 01:11:03,569
breaking down
into their composite parts.

450
01:11:04,871 --> 01:11:06,706
It's a totally natural process.

451
01:11:08,608 --> 01:11:10,342
There's nothing to be afraid of.

452
01:11:12,178 --> 01:11:13,613
I'm not afraid of you.

453
01:11:16,448 --> 01:11:18,884
I'm not afraid of you.

454
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

455
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

456
01:15:58,456 --> 01:16:00,191
Hey! Stop!

457
01:16:00,991 --> 01:16:02,892
No! No!

458
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:09,791
All right.

459
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

460
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:45,343
No!

461
01:19:57,053 --> 01:19:58,088
Oh, shit!

462
01:21:32,613 --> 01:21:35,246
That's how we found you,
we saw you up on the peak,

463
01:21:35,248 --> 01:21:37,983
and the next thing we saw,
you were fighting a bear.

464
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:41,087
I can't believe you fought
a fucking bear, dude!

465
01:21:41,488 --> 01:21:43,488
How did they find me so fast?

466
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:45,356
Sandra convinced the police

467
01:21:45,358 --> 01:21:47,093
to come out early in the dark.

468
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,460
I mean, we followed the peaks
by the moonlight

469
01:21:49,462 --> 01:21:51,228
almost all the way
to Brighton Rock.

470
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:53,098
To be early is to be on time.

471
01:21:57,637 --> 01:21:58,903
A fall then?

472
01:21:58,905 --> 01:22:03,275
No. These marks indicate a bear
most likely got to him first.

473
01:22:03,542 --> 01:22:05,609
Poor bugger was probably
still alive.

474
01:22:05,611 --> 01:22:08,613
Wendy, will you sit down?
I mean, your leg.

475
01:22:08,615 --> 01:22:10,082
...fall probably
happened after.

476
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:12,384
There's bear hair
underneath his nails.

477
01:22:15,354 --> 01:22:16,555
You're real lucky, miss.

478
01:22:17,088 --> 01:22:18,789
Once a bear gets a taste
for blood,

479
01:22:18,791 --> 01:22:20,759
there's no fear of humans
left in them.

480
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,661
This one was denned up in a cave
not a quarter mile up that way.

481
01:22:24,663 --> 01:22:26,264
Real territorial
this time of year.

482
01:22:26,832 --> 01:22:28,333
Smart of you not to run.

483
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,403
If you had you would've
ended up like this fella here.

484
01:22:32,404 --> 01:22:33,772
Wh... who was he?

485
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,540
Red Bumgardner.

486
01:22:36,542 --> 01:22:38,008
He's a local hunter.

487
01:22:38,409 --> 01:22:39,711
He went missing a while back.

488
01:22:39,979 --> 01:22:42,113
Camping. Presumed dead.

489
01:22:45,283 --> 01:22:46,551
This can't be him.

490
01:22:47,085 --> 01:22:50,053
He was here.
I... I... I talked to him.

491
01:22:50,788 --> 01:22:54,459
Look, honey,
whoever you talked to,

492
01:22:55,326 --> 01:22:56,361
was not him.

493
01:22:56,995 --> 01:22:59,695
This man's been lying here dead
for days now.

494
01:22:59,697 --> 01:23:02,466
No, I saw him, okay?

495
01:23:02,867 --> 01:23:04,334
He had a knife, and...

496
01:23:04,535 --> 01:23:05,737
Do you mean this knife?

497
01:23:07,104 --> 01:23:09,474
No. That...
That's not possible.

498
01:23:09,841 --> 01:23:12,441
Well, we need to get
his prints back to the lab

499
01:23:12,443 --> 01:23:14,711
to be 100 percent, but...

500
01:23:15,012 --> 01:23:17,178
- the photos match.
- Photo?

501
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:19,116
Oh now, we found this
in his pocket. Here.

502
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:21,184
It still works
if you can believe it.

503
01:23:21,385 --> 01:23:23,420
It charged right up
after we gave it some juice.

504
01:23:29,325 --> 01:23:30,725
I've been coming up here
for years.

505
01:23:30,727 --> 01:23:31,860
I've got one just like it.

506
01:23:31,862 --> 01:23:33,297
There's a lot of predators
up here.

507
01:23:34,431 --> 01:23:35,332
No!

508
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:42,371
You had a rough night.
You did good.

509
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:44,775
There's nothing
to be afraid of now.

510
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:54,317
Miss? Miss?

511
01:23:56,752 --> 01:23:57,787
Is she okay?

512
01:23:58,021 --> 01:23:59,221
Are you all right?

513
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:01,722
Wendy?

514
01:24:01,724 --> 01:24:03,491
Wendy?

515
