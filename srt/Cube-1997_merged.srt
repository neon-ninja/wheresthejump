1
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,846
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

3
00:05:16,646 --> 00:05:19,313
It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you.

4
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:20,766
What do you want?

5
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:21,719
I thought you were...

6
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:22,892
What?

7
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:25,188
I don't know.

8
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:39,602
Help! Help!

9
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:45,140
Help! Help!

10
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,938
Stop!

11
00:05:56,153 --> 00:06:00,229
- What? What?
- It's okay. Come here.

12
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:23,447
It's okay. Calm down.
Everything's gonna be fine.

13
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,777
What was in there?

14
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:26,898
Just gimme a minute
to figure things out.

15
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:29,990
- Why were you afraid of that room?
- Gimme a minute I said.

16
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,781
How many people are in this thing?

17
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:43,195
Listen. We can't go
climbing around in here.

18
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:44,566
Why not?

19
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:49,030
- There are traps.
- What do you mean traps?

20
00:06:49,162 --> 00:06:52,326
Booby traps. I looked
into a room down there and

21
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,154
something almost cut my head off.

22
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:03,031
Holy cats. Holy, holy cats.

23
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:25,125
You alright? Mister?

24
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:28,658
Worth!

25
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:34,784
Don't worry.

26
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:42,042
I hit my head.

27
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,954
Let me take a look at that.
I'm a doctor. It doesn't look that bad.

28
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:52,547
What the hell are you doing?

29
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:08,544
Hey, old man,
did you hear what I said?

30
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:33,512
Motion detectors. Integrated
into the walls. Tough to spot.

31
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:38,303
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

32
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:45,095
Wait a second.
Let's all just relax for a minute.

33
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:49,298
Does anybody remember
how they got here?

34
00:08:57,476 --> 00:08:58,506
Perogies.

35
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:03,590
I was eating dinner.

36
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,423
Perogies. Cheese and potatoes.

37
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,186
I ran out of sour cream and then
I went to the fridge and then...

38
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:10,134
I don't know.

39
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:14,014
You? Leaven?

40
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:19,177
I, I just went to bed and...

41
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:23,052
What about you?

42
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,807
I just woke up here.

43
00:09:27,106 --> 00:09:28,267
Middle of the night.

44
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:31,600
It's like Chile. They always come
in the middle of the night.

45
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,555
Who?

46
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:36,220
Only the goverment could build
something this ugly.

47
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:37,429
It ain't government.

48
00:09:37,524 --> 00:09:39,894
- Then what is it?
- I don't know.

49
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:42,519
Aliens.

50
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:49,314
Please.
We're spooked enough as it is.

51
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:54,106
Let's rule out aliens for now and
concentrate on what we know.

52
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,391
My mom's gonna freak.

53
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:56,934
Rennes?

54
00:09:57,861 --> 00:10:01,558
- I just won't be there. They'll freak.
- What do you think, Rennes?

55
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:04,732
We won't solve jack shit sittin' still.

56
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,310
I'm moving in a straight line
'till I get to the end.

57
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:09,445
All right, I tend to agree.

58
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:12,192
- Shouldn't we wait here?
- For what?

59
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,106
To see if anybody comes.

60
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,649
No one is gonna come.

61
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:19,687
Look. There is a way in here,
so there's gotta be a way out.

62
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,314
We can avoid
the traps using the boot.

63
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:26,314
Holloway is it?
What do you think? Look for an exit?

64
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:27,904
Okay.

65
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,063
What about you?

66
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:33,656
- It can't be that simple.
- It won't be that simple.

67
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,780
Look around.
Take a good long looksee.

68
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:41,905
'Cause I got a feeling
it's looking at us.

69
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:51,702
I just want to wake up.

70
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:01,490
Leaven. We can do this.

71
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:05,281
We just have to stay calm
and work together as a team.

72
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,824
There's gonna be a lot of people
looking for us on the outside.

73
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:11,363
I'm a cop.

74
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:13,114
All right?

75
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:16,201
- You're a cop?
- Yeah.

76
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,490
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise.

77
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,117
You gotta be with me on this one.

78
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:28,158
Okay.

79
00:11:40,045 --> 00:11:41,076
Boot it!

80
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:49,953
Clean.

81
00:12:09,884 --> 00:12:11,377
That one sounded closer.

82
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:14,587
It's mechanical. It seems
to come at regular intervals.

83
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,840
Maybe it's the ventilation system.

84
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:19,719
- No vents.
- No kidding, I'm boiling.

85
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:24,257
What is it?

86
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,834
Serial numbers?

87
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:31,928
Room numbers.
They're different in each room.

88
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:36,506
Oh great. There are only 566 millions
400 thousand rooms in this thing.

89
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:37,924
Well, there better not be?

90
00:12:38,014 --> 00:12:40,135
We have about 3 days
without food and water

91
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:42,213
before we are too weak to move.

92
00:12:42,556 --> 00:12:44,263
Well, they have to feed us,
don't they?

93
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,760
Holloway.

94
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:51,969
Oh, we have heat, stress, physical
exsection, i.e., dehydratation,

95
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:55,424
headaches, dizziness, disorientation,
confused mental processes.

96
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:58,432
The body eventually begins
to break down its own tissue.

97
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:01,553
Suck on it.

98
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:07,266
Keeps the saliva flowing.

99
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:27,975
- What?
- The air seems dry in there.

100
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:29,220
Trapped?

101
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:31,430
Molecular chemical sensor.

102
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:33,602
Why the hell didn't
the boot set it off?

103
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:35,017
The boot's not alive.

104
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,558
Detects hydrogen sulphide
excreted from the skin.

105
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:41,222
How is it you know
so much about sensors, Renz?

106
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:50,935
Renn. Not Renz. It's French.

107
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,184
Fine, you're French.
I'm asking how you...

108
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,234
Renn. Sensor expert,

109
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:00,516
about the right age.

110
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:02,641
I don't believe it.

111
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:08,892
- This guy is the Wren.
- The what?

112
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:13,273
He's the Wren. The Bird of Attica.
Flew the coop on 6 major prisons.

113
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,811
Seven.

114
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:16,737
You're kidding, right?

115
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,900
You can get us out.

116
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:20,109
Maybe.

117
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:22,321
An escape artist.

118
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:24,314
Yeah, I'm Harry fucking Houdini.

119
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,152
The only reason I dragged you
this far is 'cause I need your boots.

120
00:14:29,908 --> 00:14:32,397
If you don't smarten up,
I'll be gone like that.

121
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:35,063
No more talking.

122
00:14:36,284 --> 00:14:37,563
No more guessing.

123
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:41,817
Don't even think about nothing
that's not right in front of you.

124
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:44,407
That's the real challenge.

125
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:48,357
You got to save yourselves
from yourselves.

126
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,242
Merde.

127
00:15:09,206 --> 00:15:10,534
Get him out!

128
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:46,457
Oh my god!

129
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:59,496
So, it was electro chemical or
whatever, right? And he missed it.

130
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:03,830
The Wren. That's great!
That's fuckin' great!

131
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:20,000
All right. It's time
to reassess this place.

132
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,584
I've been over it again and again.

133
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,793
Why would they throw
innocent people in here?

134
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:26,344
Are we being punished?

135
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:29,751
I've never done anything
to deserve this.

136
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,417
Forget about all that!

137
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:35,470
You can't see the big picture
from in here, so don't try.

138
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:37,345
Keep your head down.
Keep it simple.

139
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,670
Just look at what's in front of you.

140
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:40,877
That's what he said.

141
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:45,639
Start with us.
We got an escape artist and a cop.

142
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,051
There's gotta be a reason for that.

143
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:51,671
You're doctor, Holloway. It gives you
a function, a reason, right?

144
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:53,973
No. It's just makes me go why me

145
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:57,092
and why not one of the other
10 million doctors out there.

146
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:05,677
Leaven, what are you?

147
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:12,307
Nothing. I just go to school.
I hang out with my friends.

148
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:14,883
- What else?
- There's nothing else.

149
00:17:15,937 --> 00:17:19,718
My parents are these people.
I live with them. I'm boring.

150
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:23,849
I think we have to ask
the big questions.

151
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,354
What does it want?

152
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,187
What is it thinking?

153
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,604
One down, four to go.

154
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:36,638
Why don't you tell us
what your purpose is, Worth?

155
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:38,433
Often wondered that myself.

156
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,513
I'm just a guy.

157
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,899
I work in an office building,
doing office building stuff.

158
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:54,147
I wasn't exactly bursting with
"joie de vivre" before I got here.

159
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:55,858
Life just sucks in general.

160
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:59,393
- I can't stand that attitude.
- Because he's right.

161
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:02,357
What's your purpose, Quentin?

162
00:18:07,404 --> 00:18:09,975
Kids, three of them.

163
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,987
I haven't made my peace yet.

164
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,021
I'm getting out of here,
no matter what.

165
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,153
That's where
my strength comes from.

166
00:18:19,823 --> 00:18:21,730
You, people,
find yours wherever you got it.

167
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:25,154
For Christ's sake, Worth.
What do you live for?

168
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,480
Don't you have a wife or
a girlfriend, or something?

169
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:29,986
No. I've got a pretty fine
collection of pornography.

170
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:32,779
Oh, nice, nice.

171
00:18:34,575 --> 00:18:38,190
I haven't got anybody either, but
I'm not giving up! I am pissed off.

172
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:39,867
They came into our homes!

173
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:44,445
They stripped us bare.
They took my rings, they took...

174
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:47,365
...oh, my amethyst.

175
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:52,945
I wanna know who's responsible.

176
00:18:54,037 --> 00:18:56,526
Leaven. Your glasses?

177
00:18:58,871 --> 00:18:59,901
You don't need them?

178
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:01,985
They're for reading.

179
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,705
Well they took off our jewelry,
but why they put these on you.

180
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:11,320
If nothing is random,

181
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:13,452
why are they here?

182
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:25,115
Leaven. What do you do
in school? Math?

183
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,574
What can they mean?

184
00:19:42,379 --> 00:19:43,658
149.

185
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:03,287
Prime numbers. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

186
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:04,378
See what?

187
00:20:04,674 --> 00:20:07,210
It seems like, if any
of these numbers are prime,

188
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:08,372
then the room's trapped.

189
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:15,873
645, 645... That's not prime.

190
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:19,165
372... no.

191
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,917
649...

192
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:26,500
Well, 11 times 59.
It's not prime either.

193
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,463
So that room is safe.

194
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:31,918
Wait.

195
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:35,260
How can you make that assumption
based on one prime number trap?

196
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:39,506
I'm not. The incinerator thing
was prime 083.

197
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,677
The molecular chemical thing had
137. The acid room had 149.

198
00:20:43,848 --> 00:20:45,127
You remember all that in your head?

199
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:46,675
I have a facility for it.

200
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:52,220
Leaven, you beautiful brain.

201
00:20:53,808 --> 00:20:54,554
Boot it.

202
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:00,171
Okay, out of the way.

203
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:01,927
Brains before beauty.

204
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:10,722
Safe, safe.

205
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:16,099
Prime numbers! Prime numbers!

206
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:27,350
Oh, how long have we been in here?

207
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:30,843
Nine or ten hours.

208
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,352
How do you know?

209
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:40,557
Five o'clock shadow. Last thing
I remember was shaving.

210
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:45,149
I guess
I missed breakfast or lunch...

211
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:47,014
or whatever.

212
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:52,103
Don't worry.
I'll be home in time for dinner.

213
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:57,313
If we get out, I'll make you dinner.

214
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,723
You got a date.

215
00:22:19,697 --> 00:22:20,692
Doin' good.

216
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,899
I need to smoke.
I'd smoke a butt off a sidewalk.

217
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:42,907
Holloway.
Just reel yourself in a bit. Come on.

218
00:22:43,202 --> 00:22:44,860
We're moving along.
Things are looking up.

219
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:48,199
Ok, ok. You are right.
I quit smoking years ago.

220
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,363
I just need to be occupied.

221
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:55,111
Talk then. Have a conversation.
What kind of doctor are you anyway?

222
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:57,529
Oh, you know, the free kind.

223
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,319
Come on. Help me.
Tell me about your rug rats.

224
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,825
We have three boys. 9, 7 and 5.

225
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:14,243
Good God. Poor woman.
There's no way I'd survive that.

226
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:17,238
She didn't either.

227
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,203
She's not dead,
we're just separated.

228
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:27,160
I'm sorry.
I can't just shoot the breeze.

229
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:30,536
These numbers aren't prime.

230
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:32,368
Okay, clear.

231
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:38,413
Excuse me, sorry.

232
00:23:44,212 --> 00:23:47,045
You, could try and
help me out here, buddy.

233
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:48,624
No, I couldn't.

234
00:23:58,089 --> 00:23:59,748
This one's trapped too.

235
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,340
We have to backtrack?

236
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,087
Not yet.

237
00:24:18,885 --> 00:24:19,915
Read them to me.

238
00:24:33,762 --> 00:24:36,926
- What are you, his coat rack?
- Oh, please!

239
00:24:48,431 --> 00:24:49,462
It's stuck.

240
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:53,220
Look out.

241
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:02,766
This room is green.

242
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,430
Holloway?

243
00:25:17,562 --> 00:25:18,391
Hi there.

244
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:24,721
This room is green.

245
00:25:25,396 --> 00:25:26,309
Yes, it is.

246
00:25:28,605 --> 00:25:30,561
I wanna go back to the blue room.

247
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:33,558
What is it? Shock or what?

248
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:35,890
I think he's mentally handicapped.

249
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,064
I like the blue room.

250
00:25:39,482 --> 00:25:42,978
- Jesus Christ.
- He almost broke my neck.

251
00:25:43,691 --> 00:25:47,602
Hey there, are you all alone?
You want to hold my hand, honey?

252
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:52,015
Butter first, then honey, Kazan.
Butter first, then honey...

253
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:56,359
- How'd he survive?
- I want to go back to the blue room.

254
00:25:56,735 --> 00:25:59,438
There's lots of blue rooms.
We'll find you another real soon.

255
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:02,235
This is just way too bizarre.

256
00:26:03,236 --> 00:26:05,441
Well, you just worry
about your numbers then.

257
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:09,652
Go on. I'll look after him.

258
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:17,061
Safe. Obviously,
since he almost fell on my head.

259
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:20,486
Should we go for a walk, Kazan?

260
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:22,728
You want to go for a walk?

261
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:39,357
Let's not make him do
the climbing thing right away.

262
00:26:39,576 --> 00:26:40,440
Holloway...

263
00:26:41,576 --> 00:26:42,606
Hol-Io-way.

264
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:50,191
Could they have taken us
all the way to New Mexico?

265
00:26:50,328 --> 00:26:51,785
What are you
talking about, Holloway?

266
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:55,781
I'm talking about where do you
hide something this big.

267
00:26:56,495 --> 00:26:58,072
At least he's good for something.

268
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,988
I'm sorry to shake
your foundations, Quentin,

269
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,492
but you have no idea
where your tax dollars go.

270
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:08,864
Free clinic doctors?

271
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:11,951
Only the military
industrial complex could afford

272
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,746
to build something this size.

273
00:27:13,873 --> 00:27:17,489
Holloway, what is
the military industrial complex?

274
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:18,956
Have you ever been there?

275
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,582
I'm telling you,
it's not that complex.

276
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,414
How would you know
from where you are?

277
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,574
Who do you think
the establishment is?

278
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:26,946
It's just guys like me.

279
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:29,574
Their desks are bigger,
but their jobs are't.

280
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:31,623
They don't conspire...
they buy boats.

281
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:35,328
No, this place is...
remember Scaramanga?

282
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,201
The bad guy in
"The Man With The Golden Gun".

283
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:42,831
It's some rich
psycho's entertainment.

284
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:47,040
Is that what you think?

285
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:48,959
Clear.

286
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:01,956
Ok. You are a cop.

287
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:06,130
Single bullet theory. Right on.

288
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:19,218
- Gas!
- Holloway, get back here!

289
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:27,465
It's okay.
I just swallowed my button.

290
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:33,886
I hate this. I hate this.

291
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,134
Your boy is having
a conniption fit in there.

292
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:47,713
It's like cramming without coffee.

293
00:28:48,056 --> 00:28:49,928
- She needs a break.
- She can do it.

294
00:28:59,892 --> 00:29:01,266
They don't look like prime to me.

295
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:04,007
Is that your two bits worth, Worth?

296
00:29:05,018 --> 00:29:06,510
For what it's worth.

297
00:29:11,894 --> 00:29:17,097
- Well?
- Well, he's right. Not prime.

298
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,603
Stop! In front of you!

299
00:29:38,273 --> 00:29:39,186
What is it?

300
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,562
Shut up!

301
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:56,645
I don't know what happened.
It wasn't prime.

302
00:29:58,985 --> 00:30:00,644
Quentin, hold still.

303
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:07,812
- Somebody stops that racket.
- Worth!

304
00:30:10,904 --> 00:30:12,148
Leave the boots.

305
00:30:21,906 --> 00:30:23,813
And shut the fucking door!

306
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:30,022
I had a feeling
about that fucking guy.

307
00:30:30,824 --> 00:30:32,365
He knew about that trap.

308
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:34,235
These numbers aren't prime.

309
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:36,067
Then your number system failed,
but he knew...

310
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:37,900
Knew what? How would he know?

311
00:30:38,034 --> 00:30:39,610
You are the paranoid one,
think about it.

312
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:42,272
His only function so far has been
to kick us when we're down.

313
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:45,283
So he has a bad attitude. Are you
saying, that makes him a spy?

314
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:48,071
Trust me on this. It's my job
to read people like an X-Ray.

315
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:54,941
He doesn't like red rooms.

316
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,610
So what happened?

317
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,701
- You saw what happened.
- Quentin!

318
00:31:08,122 --> 00:31:09,947
I guess the numbers are
more complicated that I thought.

319
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:11,659
Maybe they mean nothing at all.

320
00:31:11,998 --> 00:31:13,740
No. It means
they are more involved.

321
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:15,955
They've worked for us up 'till now,
haven't they?

322
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,747
I just need more time with them.

323
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,280
Well, we need to rest anyway.

324
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:24,330
Well. That's handy. 'Cause there's
not a fuck of a lot else we can do.

325
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:39,368
Are they telling you anything?

326
00:31:40,503 --> 00:31:41,912
They're not tarot cards.

327
00:31:44,212 --> 00:31:46,961
Do you have any idea how many
variables I have to consider

328
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:49,665
before I can
decipher numbers this size?

329
00:31:50,504 --> 00:31:52,412
They don't reveal
themselves right away.

330
00:31:53,672 --> 00:31:54,785
They're like people.

331
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:03,248
Oh, gross.

332
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,500
Oh, not here honey.
Over in the corner.

333
00:32:16,676 --> 00:32:18,382
Well, he's just peeing.

334
00:32:19,468 --> 00:32:20,961
Jesus Christ.

335
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,545
That's excellent.
Now it totally reeks in here!

336
00:32:26,969 --> 00:32:28,711
You find this all
pretty funny, don't you?

337
00:32:34,345 --> 00:32:36,253
What's your
fucking problem, Worth?

338
00:32:37,971 --> 00:32:39,927
Even Holloway's
holding up better than you.

339
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:44,715
Get over there and help her with him.
That's your job. Babysitter.

340
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:48,597
Jawohl, Kommandant.

341
00:32:51,557 --> 00:32:53,880
Somebody has to take
responsability around here.

342
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:56,637
And that somebody has to be you.

343
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,763
Not all of us have
the luxury of playing nihilist.

344
00:32:59,266 --> 00:33:02,099
Not all of us are
conceited enough to play hero.

345
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,842
This is a will to live.

346
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,682
Everybody's got it,
Worth, even you.

347
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:10,133
Especially you,
hiding behind that cynical front.

348
00:33:10,685 --> 00:33:11,680
A will to live.

349
00:33:12,144 --> 00:33:14,715
That's the warm,
cosy feeling deep inside.

350
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:17,225
Thanks Quentin, I'm a new man.

351
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:20,926
Oh, poor Worth. Nobody loves me.

352
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:22,853
If that's the chip
on your shoulder, why

353
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:24,057
did you lug it all this way?

354
00:33:24,354 --> 00:33:25,930
Why didn't you
just lie down and die?

355
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,970
Do it.

356
00:33:41,482 --> 00:33:44,231
Show us you have some backbone
and jump in the sushi machine.

357
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:45,769
Be a man.

358
00:33:55,318 --> 00:33:56,515
Thought so.

359
00:33:59,277 --> 00:34:00,734
Fuck you Quentin!

360
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:05,814
I don't wanna die.
I'm just being realistic.

361
00:34:05,903 --> 00:34:07,728
Do you think they'd go to all
the trouble to build this thing

362
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,934
if we could just walk out?

363
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:10,190
Do you think
they would have left us clues

364
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:12,316
and let us beat it so far
if there wasn't a way out?

365
00:34:12,404 --> 00:34:13,683
You think we matter? We don't.

366
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:16,446
Put us out of your misery so we can
get on with getting out of here.

367
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,904
You're not getting out of here!

368
00:34:17,988 --> 00:34:19,529
- Yes, we are!
- No, you're not!

369
00:34:19,614 --> 00:34:22,695
- Yes, we are!
- There is no way out of here!

370
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:39,481
Gotchya.

371
00:34:45,743 --> 00:34:49,524
How do you know that?

372
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,612
Answer the question, Worth.

373
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,860
Oh, god.

374
00:35:02,746 --> 00:35:03,908
Who are you?

375
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,747
I'm the poison.

376
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,831
I designed the outer shell.

377
00:35:21,749 --> 00:35:22,828
The what?

378
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,907
The shell. The sarcophagus.

379
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,743
You built this thing?

380
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:30,113
Not this part. The exterior.

381
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:33,000
I don't know anything about the
numbers or anything else in here.

382
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:37,663
I was contracted to draw
plans for a hollow shell.

383
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:40,283
A cube.

384
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:44,037
A cube? Why didn't you tell us?

385
00:35:45,128 --> 00:35:48,162
For God's sake, Worth,
you knew what it was.

386
00:35:50,087 --> 00:35:51,249
No.

387
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:55,004
Worth. You're lying.

388
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:00,457
Was not at first.

389
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:02,619
Who's behind it?

390
00:36:06,674 --> 00:36:07,669
I don't know.

391
00:36:08,382 --> 00:36:09,757
Who hired you?

392
00:36:11,716 --> 00:36:12,747
I didn't ask.

393
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:16,792
I never even left my office.

394
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,916
I talked on the phone to some
people, other guys like me.

395
00:36:20,093 --> 00:36:22,167
Specialists,
working on small details.

396
00:36:22,343 --> 00:36:23,622
Nobody knew what it was.

397
00:36:24,343 --> 00:36:25,457
Nobody cared.

398
00:36:25,677 --> 00:36:28,380
Bullshit.
You knew from square one.

399
00:36:29,261 --> 00:36:32,343
Look at him. He is up
to his eyeballs in this thing.

400
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,717
No, Quentin.
That's how they stay hidden.

401
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:37,376
You keep everyone separated

402
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:39,924
so the left hand doesn't know
what the right hand is doing.

403
00:36:40,054 --> 00:36:42,211
The brain
never comes out in the open.

404
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,258
Whose brain?

405
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:48,045
It's all the same machine, right!

406
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:51,962
The Pentagone, multinational
corporations, the police.

407
00:36:52,598 --> 00:36:56,427
If you do one little job,
you build a widget in Saskatoon,

408
00:36:56,557 --> 00:36:58,928
and the next thing you know
it's two miles under

409
00:36:59,058 --> 00:37:02,222
the desert, the essential
component of a death machine.

410
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:05,849
I was right.
All along, my whole life,

411
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:08,262
I knew it. I told you, Quentin.

412
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,846
Nobody's every gonna
call me paranoid again.

413
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:13,933
We gotta get out of here and
blow the lid of this thing!

414
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:22,386
Holloway, you don't get it.

415
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:25,634
Then help me,
please, I need to know.

416
00:37:27,104 --> 00:37:28,811
This may be hard
for you to understand,

417
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:30,638
but there's no conspiracy.

418
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:32,562
Nobody is in charge.

419
00:37:33,105 --> 00:37:37,598
It's a headless blunder operating
under the illusion of a master plan.

420
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:39,053
Can you grasp that?

421
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,597
Big brother is not watching you.

422
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:46,056
What kind of
fuckin' explanation is that?

423
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:47,435
It's the best you are gonna get.

424
00:37:47,524 --> 00:37:49,350
I looked, and the only conclusion
I could come to is that

425
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:50,934
there is nobody up there.

426
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:53,188
Somebody had to say
yes to this thing.

427
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:55,183
What thing?
Only we know what it is.

428
00:37:55,276 --> 00:37:58,393
- We have no idea what it is.
- We know more than anybody else.

429
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,856
I mean, somebody might have
known sometime before they go,

430
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:03,479
they got fired, or
voted out, or sold it,

431
00:38:03,861 --> 00:38:05,484
but if this place
ever had a purpose,

432
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:08,058
and it got miscommunicated,
or lost in a shuffle.

433
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:09,730
I mean, this is and accident,

434
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,233
a forgotten perpetual
public works project.

435
00:38:13,487 --> 00:38:15,146
Do you think anybody
wants to ask questions?

436
00:38:15,404 --> 00:38:17,525
All they want is
a clear conscience,

437
00:38:17,655 --> 00:38:18,899
and a fat paycheck.

438
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,986
I leaned on my shovel
for months on this one.

439
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:22,488
This was a great job!

440
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:26,447
Why put people in it?

441
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,531
Because it's here. You have
to use it or you admit it's pointless.

442
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:33,814
But it is pointless.

443
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,488
Quentin. That's my point.

444
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,657
What have we come to?

445
00:38:42,201 --> 00:38:44,357
It's so much worse than I thought.

446
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:48,409
Not really. Just more pathetic.

447
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,490
You make me sick, Worth.

448
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:53,617
I make me sick too.

449
00:38:54,494 --> 00:38:55,987
We're both part of the system.

450
00:38:56,578 --> 00:39:00,074
I drew a box, you walk a beat.
It's like you said, Quentin,

451
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,076
is keep your head down,
keep it simple,

452
00:39:02,204 --> 00:39:03,614
just look at what's in front of you.

453
00:39:03,746 --> 00:39:05,536
I mean, nobody wants to see
the big picture.

454
00:39:05,788 --> 00:39:07,067
Life's too complicated.

455
00:39:07,872 --> 00:39:12,909
I mean, let's face it, the reason
we're here is that it's out of control.

456
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,491
This is how we ruin the world?

457
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:32,582
Well, have you been on glue
all your lives?

458
00:39:33,209 --> 00:39:36,741
I've felt guilty for ruining
the world since I was like 7.

459
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:41,409
God, if you need someone
to blame, throw a rock.

460
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,832
Well, I feel better.

461
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:52,836
That's why you stayed with us.

462
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:55,534
To confess.

463
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:12,835
You still looking
for someone to bust, Quentin?

464
00:40:22,926 --> 00:40:24,917
Quentin! Stop it! Stop it!

465
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,916
We need him.

466
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,464
What for?

467
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:33,675
Have you gone absolutely mad?

468
00:40:33,803 --> 00:40:36,209
He's the only one who knows
anything about the place.

469
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:51,512
- Worth.
- Hi.

470
00:40:52,306 --> 00:40:55,258
- So there's this outer shell.
- Yeah.

471
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:59,296
- And it's a cube, right? Like this.
- I assume so.

472
00:40:59,516 --> 00:41:02,219
- Are there any doors?
- There's one door.

473
00:41:02,308 --> 00:41:04,714
- Where?
- Wherever the door guy put it.

474
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,970
Six guesses, and
it's sealed from the outside.

475
00:41:08,976 --> 00:41:12,010
And, what are the dimensions
of the outer shell?

476
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,051
434 square feet.

477
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:26,974
May I?

478
00:41:27,062 --> 00:41:28,935
Come on, honey, slide over.

479
00:41:34,772 --> 00:41:37,059
14 by 14 by 14.

480
00:41:37,314 --> 00:41:40,396
The inner cube can't be flush
with the shell wall, there's a space.

481
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:42,019
One cube?

482
00:41:42,398 --> 00:41:43,808
I don't know, it makes sense.

483
00:41:45,191 --> 00:41:50,607
Ok. The biggest the cube
can be then is...

484
00:41:51,317 --> 00:41:54,730
26 rooms high,
26 rooms across, so...

485
00:41:55,192 --> 00:41:57,598
17.576 rooms.

486
00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:01,807
Seventeen thousand, five hundred
and seventy-six rooms?

487
00:42:04,402 --> 00:42:05,860
That makes me queasy.

488
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,017
Descartes!

489
00:42:13,737 --> 00:42:16,985
- Leaven, you are a genius.
- What? What?

490
00:42:17,654 --> 00:42:21,815
Cartesian coordinates. Of course,
coded cartesian coordinates.

491
00:42:22,114 --> 00:42:25,065
They're used in geometry to plot
points on a 3-dimensional graph.

492
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:27,314
In English, slower.

493
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:31,237
Bonjour?
These numbers are markers,

494
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:34,405
and grid reference, like latitude
and longitude on a map.

495
00:42:34,741 --> 00:42:37,526
The numbers tell us where
we are inside the cube.

496
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:39,032
Well, where are we?

497
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:43,732
It works.

498
00:42:43,992 --> 00:42:47,821
Okay. All I have to do is add
the numbers together.

499
00:42:48,451 --> 00:42:50,241
The X coordinate is 19...

500
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:54,863
Y is 26 rooms...

501
00:42:56,203 --> 00:42:57,696
So that places us...

502
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:02,327
...seven rooms from the edge.

503
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:04,861
All right, let's go.

504
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:09,110
Just out of curiosity, I mean,
don't hit me again, or anything...

505
00:43:09,247 --> 00:43:10,444
but what are you gonna do
when you get there?

506
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:12,079
Maybe we can get the door open.

507
00:43:13,497 --> 00:43:16,828
What we need is to do figure out
how to get around the traps.

508
00:43:16,915 --> 00:43:18,159
I'm dealing with that Holloway.

509
00:43:18,248 --> 00:43:19,825
I'm looking for
practical solutions here.

510
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:22,156
Well, you haven't found any yet.

511
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:30,289
We cut the risk with the numbers
and the boot. Worth will go in first.

512
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:33,160
No, he won't Quentin!
We take turns!

513
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:35,407
Relax.

514
00:43:44,003 --> 00:43:45,116
Room for two in there?

515
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:52,618
What's the matter?

516
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:56,454
These coordinates. 14, 27, 14.

517
00:43:57,088 --> 00:43:59,375
- What about 'em?
- They don't make sense.

518
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,830
Assuming the cube is
26 rooms across,

519
00:44:01,964 --> 00:44:03,872
there can't be
a coordinate larger than 26.

520
00:44:04,465 --> 00:44:06,705
If this were right, then
we would be outside of the cube.

521
00:44:09,674 --> 00:44:11,795
No, not outside of the cube.

522
00:44:13,758 --> 00:44:15,500
I guess that means
we're not having dinner.

523
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:22,629
Trap. Trap. Trap. Trap.

524
00:44:24,885 --> 00:44:26,046
Trap!

525
00:44:33,553 --> 00:44:34,715
Trap!

526
00:44:40,012 --> 00:44:41,209
Sound activated.

527
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,589
Lovely.

528
00:44:59,891 --> 00:45:02,462
How come the sound of the door
opening didn't set it off?

529
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:04,516
Must be rigged to ignore it.

530
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,303
So that's it. The edge is
surrounded by traps.

531
00:45:07,434 --> 00:45:11,096
Well, I guess we have to backtrack,
and try somewhere else.

532
00:45:11,226 --> 00:45:13,383
Who knows how many detours
we'll have to take.

533
00:45:14,018 --> 00:45:15,760
I say we cross the bitch.

534
00:45:16,144 --> 00:45:17,471
Right!

535
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:20,640
How many boots do we have left,
Holloway?

536
00:45:24,895 --> 00:45:26,092
Get it off him.

537
00:45:27,104 --> 00:45:29,260
We know how it works.
We just have to be quiet.

538
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:31,139
That's pretty fucking quiet.

539
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:34,970
I'm glad you're on side,
Worth, 'cause... you're up.

540
00:45:36,564 --> 00:45:37,761
And he is not coming.

541
00:45:38,231 --> 00:45:39,640
Of course, he is.

542
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:42,848
- No way.
- We are not leaving him behind.

543
00:45:42,982 --> 00:45:44,095
He's unpredictable.

544
00:45:44,482 --> 00:45:46,023
When we get to the edge,
we can come back for him.

545
00:45:46,107 --> 00:45:47,849
But he'll get somebody killed here.

546
00:45:48,191 --> 00:45:49,221
Am I right?

547
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,597
Shame on you.

548
00:45:53,442 --> 00:45:55,314
Will you look at yourselves?

549
00:45:56,567 --> 00:45:58,108
What have you turned into?

550
00:45:58,526 --> 00:46:02,603
They may have taken our lives away,
but we are still human beings.

551
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,317
That's all we've got left.

552
00:46:07,736 --> 00:46:09,146
We'll come back for him.

553
00:46:10,653 --> 00:46:12,691
That's a lie and you know it.

554
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:23,900
He'll be quiet.

555
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:02,462
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna wait for him.

556
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:04,883
- No.
- You go out, I'm here.

557
00:49:05,225 --> 00:49:06,255
Okay.

558
00:49:17,894 --> 00:49:19,007
This way.

559
00:51:03,745 --> 00:51:06,448
- You fucking fuck!
- That's enough!

560
00:51:06,538 --> 00:51:09,205
- He is a trap!
- Let him go right now!

561
00:51:09,288 --> 00:51:11,907
The law of the jungle!
He is endangering the pack!

562
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,154
Let him go, you Nazi!

563
00:51:16,498 --> 00:51:17,659
What did you call me?

564
00:51:17,831 --> 00:51:20,581
Quentin, you let
that innocent boy go.

565
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:24,537
You listen to me, woman.

566
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:28,373
Everyday I mop up
after your bleeding heart.

567
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,781
The only reason you
even exist is because I keep you.

568
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:35,161
I know your type,

569
00:51:36,043 --> 00:51:39,373
no kids, no man to fuck you.

570
00:51:39,918 --> 00:51:41,625
So you go around outraged,

571
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,284
sticking your nose up
other people's assholes,

572
00:51:44,377 --> 00:51:45,918
sniffing their business!!!

573
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:50,077
You missed your boat, Holloway.

574
00:51:53,171 --> 00:51:55,624
You're all dried up
inside there, aren't you?

575
00:51:56,296 --> 00:51:58,003
That's your fucking problem.

576
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:01,125
How dare you say that to her?

577
00:52:02,255 --> 00:52:05,420
You don't know her, Quentin.
None of us know each other here.

578
00:52:05,548 --> 00:52:08,996
- Oh, I do.
- No you don't.

579
00:52:09,382 --> 00:52:11,787
No wonder your wife left you.

580
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:16,915
All that bottled up anger.

581
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:21,207
And a thing for young girls.

582
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:33,129
God help you, Quentin.

583
00:52:35,136 --> 00:52:37,293
Did you smack
your kids around too?

584
00:52:51,806 --> 00:52:56,464
Is anybody besides me interested in
what's on the other side of that door?

585
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,635
Open it.

586
00:53:08,267 --> 00:53:11,514
Door number six? Not number one?
Door number two?

587
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:14,802
Open the fuckin' thing.

588
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:21,008
Oh, sunshine.

589
00:53:46,815 --> 00:53:47,846
Night time.

590
00:53:48,732 --> 00:53:50,558
My old friend, the shell.

591
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:56,106
It's there. Morning!

592
00:53:59,651 --> 00:54:00,515
Hang on to me.

593
00:54:09,194 --> 00:54:10,391
I can't see shit.

594
00:54:12,861 --> 00:54:14,058
Nothin' to hang on to.

595
00:54:19,446 --> 00:54:20,524
We gotta try something.

596
00:54:21,154 --> 00:54:22,647
We gotta see
if the door's over there.

597
00:54:24,363 --> 00:54:26,189
Someone has to swing
over there, and take a look.

598
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,395
Swing?

599
00:54:29,406 --> 00:54:31,895
We make a rope,
out of clothes.

600
00:54:33,073 --> 00:54:34,780
Take 'em off.
I'll tie it around myself.

601
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:36,734
Ah, yeah, and you're gonna go.

602
00:54:36,991 --> 00:54:39,361
You weight like 500 ponds,
it'll snap in two seconds.

603
00:54:40,324 --> 00:54:41,355
I'm the lightest.

604
00:54:42,158 --> 00:54:43,023
Forget it.

605
00:54:43,658 --> 00:54:44,653
I'll go.

606
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,230
I'm going, Holloway.

607
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:50,024
She's right Quentin,
you're too heavy.

608
00:54:50,368 --> 00:54:52,026
I'm the lightest after Leaven.

609
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,486
Anyway, it's my turn.

610
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:03,988
How long did you know
people were being put in here?

611
00:55:04,912 --> 00:55:06,191
A couple of months.

612
00:55:06,954 --> 00:55:08,233
That's not long,

613
00:55:08,704 --> 00:55:10,197
if you consider your whole life.

614
00:55:11,163 --> 00:55:12,111
I am.

615
00:55:13,372 --> 00:55:15,528
You opened my eyes Worht.
That's something.

616
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:18,744
David.

617
00:55:20,956 --> 00:55:21,786
Helen.

618
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:26,575
You're such a Helen.

619
00:56:14,841 --> 00:56:16,499
That's as far as you go.

620
00:56:21,134 --> 00:56:22,674
There's nothing down here.

621
00:56:24,592 --> 00:56:25,587
Hold tight.

622
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:28,342
I try swinging over there.

623
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:39,718
Brace yourselves,
I'm gonna try again.

624
00:56:45,846 --> 00:56:51,049
- Okay, one more time.
- Hurry, you're getting heavy.

625
00:57:02,432 --> 00:57:04,258
What the hell's going on?

626
00:57:04,766 --> 00:57:06,389
Get up here now!

627
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,557
- Quentin!
- Have you got her?

628
00:57:41,189 --> 00:57:45,100
- What's going on?
- Quentin, is she okay?

629
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:15,527
She... slipped.

630
00:58:17,029 --> 00:58:18,059
Holloway?

631
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,449
Hey, shhh...
Come on, Kazan.

632
00:58:53,452 --> 00:58:55,407
Kazan, will you please
stop doing that?

633
00:58:56,369 --> 00:59:00,114
Leaven, you got be strong,
sweetheart.

634
00:59:00,244 --> 00:59:01,572
Don't even talk to me.

635
00:59:04,078 --> 00:59:05,655
We gotta get down to the bottom.

636
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:10,152
It will be easier to get on
to the shell from there.

637
00:59:12,205 --> 00:59:14,694
It's a long fucking way
with only one boot.

638
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:17,362
But we gotta do it
before we get too weak.

639
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:20,864
You gotta keep
cracking the numbers, Leaven.

640
00:59:22,206 --> 00:59:23,783
I can't think anymore.

641
00:59:23,915 --> 00:59:26,914
Sure you can. It's your gift.

642
00:59:27,499 --> 00:59:30,581
It's not a gift. It's just a brain.

643
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:34,784
Let her sleep for a while. We haven't
slept in fuck knows how long.

644
00:59:36,334 --> 00:59:37,496
All right.

645
00:59:39,126 --> 00:59:40,204
One hour.

646
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:43,372
How the fuck are you gonna know
how long an hour is?

647
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,746
An hour is as long as I say.

648
01:00:52,722 --> 01:00:54,002
What are you doing?

649
01:00:56,223 --> 01:00:57,632
We have to make it down
to the bottom.

650
01:00:58,015 --> 01:00:59,887
It'll be quiet there, and
you can concentrate.

651
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:04,093
- You just want to leave them?
- They're traps, Leaven.

652
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:06,428
We are the key.

653
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:09,303
I'll get us down there.
You think us out.

654
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:10,880
Believe in me!

655
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:14,094
Try and see what I see,
how my mind works.

656
01:01:14,226 --> 01:01:17,059
The flash when I look into someone's
head like a fucking X-ray.

657
01:01:20,727 --> 01:01:21,971
I looked through the walls.

658
01:01:22,852 --> 01:01:26,894
I dreamed him at his desk,
designing everything.

659
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,227
He can't let you solve the puzzle,
see, 'cause

660
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:32,556
there is a purpose.

661
01:01:33,104 --> 01:01:34,562
We are the purpose. The cube...

662
01:01:35,438 --> 01:01:36,516
...is us.

663
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:41,394
- Quentin.
- We fit. Like numbers.

664
01:01:43,022 --> 01:01:45,974
A man and a woman.
Two halves of the equation.

665
01:01:47,273 --> 01:01:50,888
I take you down, the perfect key.

666
01:01:51,524 --> 01:01:52,934
I slip you in the lock.

667
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:01,641
Leaven, it's time to go down.

668
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:17,475
Get away from her.

669
01:02:19,695 --> 01:02:22,398
Leaven, they're fuckin' spies.

670
01:02:22,696 --> 01:02:24,023
Him, the retard.

671
01:02:24,613 --> 01:02:27,232
Holloway, had outside
information about my family...

672
01:02:27,322 --> 01:02:30,237
but she slipped up, didn't she?
She crossed the line!

673
01:02:32,989 --> 01:02:34,613
You dropped her.

674
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:39,652
Just go, Quentin.

675
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:43,356
Give us the boot, you pig!

676
01:03:02,495 --> 01:03:04,071
You don't want the boot.

677
01:03:24,998 --> 01:03:28,412
You want to came with us, Worth?
Down the hatch.

678
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:37,661
What the fuck's with him?

679
01:04:25,842 --> 01:04:27,039
How did...

680
01:04:28,926 --> 01:04:33,833
It's, it's, it's the Wren.
It's the old Wrenster.

681
01:04:35,761 --> 01:04:37,005
How could...

682
01:04:37,928 --> 01:04:40,251
We've been going around in circles.

683
01:04:41,262 --> 01:04:42,292
That can't be.

684
01:04:46,763 --> 01:04:48,837
- Where are we?
- I don't know!

685
01:04:50,847 --> 01:04:53,133
Where are we?

686
01:04:58,598 --> 01:04:59,842
You figure it out!

687
01:05:00,057 --> 01:05:03,719
You haven't done anything.
All you do is freak out you,

688
01:05:04,307 --> 01:05:05,635
murderer!

689
01:05:47,856 --> 01:05:49,515
I guess you were right, Worth.

690
01:05:50,774 --> 01:05:52,516
There is no way out of here.

691
01:06:19,112 --> 01:06:20,605
Get away from me.

692
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:57,318
Wasn't Rennes killed in that room?

693
01:07:08,454 --> 01:07:10,030
How come there's nothing out there?

694
01:07:12,746 --> 01:07:13,908
It's the edge.

695
01:07:14,121 --> 01:07:16,824
We weren't at the edge before.
Where's the room that killed Rennes?

696
01:07:17,914 --> 01:07:19,111
Fuck off!

697
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,117
Oh, that was good.

698
01:07:25,832 --> 01:07:29,447
What difference does it make?
We're dead anyways.

699
01:07:29,624 --> 01:07:34,163
Hey, listen to what I'm saying.
There was a room there before.

700
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,582
We haven't been moving in circles.
The rooms have.

701
01:07:39,959 --> 01:07:42,448
- Of course.
- The rooms?

702
01:07:42,793 --> 01:07:44,500
That explains
the thunder and the shaking.

703
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,333
We've been shifting the whole time.

704
01:07:48,419 --> 01:07:50,873
It's the only logical explanation.

705
01:07:53,587 --> 01:07:55,293
I'm such an idiot!

706
01:07:56,129 --> 01:07:58,582
- What are you on to, Leaven?
- Give me a minute.

707
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:03,915
The numbers are markers,
points on a map, right?

708
01:08:04,422 --> 01:08:05,286
Right.

709
01:08:06,505 --> 01:08:09,753
How do you map a point
that keeps moving?

710
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:14,244
Permutations.

711
01:08:16,757 --> 01:08:17,752
Permu what?

712
01:08:18,883 --> 01:08:19,913
Permutations.

713
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:22,675
A list of all the coordinates
that the room passes through.

714
01:08:22,758 --> 01:08:24,630
Like a map, that tells you
where the rooms starts,

715
01:08:24,717 --> 01:08:27,087
how many times it moves,
and where it moves to.

716
01:08:28,301 --> 01:08:29,959
The numbers tell you all that?

717
01:08:30,468 --> 01:08:32,091
I don't know,

718
01:08:32,177 --> 01:08:34,049
see, I've only been looking
at one point on the map,

719
01:08:34,135 --> 01:08:36,173
which is probably
the starting position.

720
01:08:36,844 --> 01:08:40,293
All I saw was what the cube looked
like before it started to move.

721
01:08:40,553 --> 01:08:41,880
Okay, so it's moving.

722
01:08:45,304 --> 01:08:46,548
How do we get out?

723
01:08:49,096 --> 01:08:50,376
27.

724
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:56,506
I know where the exit is.

725
01:08:57,848 --> 01:08:58,760
Where?

726
01:08:59,598 --> 01:09:01,921
- Stay away from me.
- Back off, Quentin.

727
01:09:03,099 --> 01:09:04,378
I just wanna know.

728
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:06,968
Don't you wanna know?

729
01:09:11,017 --> 01:09:13,221
You remember that room
we passed through before,

730
01:09:13,475 --> 01:09:15,762
the one with the coordinate
larger than 26?

731
01:09:16,226 --> 01:09:17,256
What about it?

732
01:09:18,351 --> 01:09:22,428
That coordinate placed the room
outside the cube.

733
01:09:25,102 --> 01:09:26,015
A bridge.

734
01:09:26,519 --> 01:09:29,932
Right.
But only in its original position.

735
01:09:31,562 --> 01:09:32,841
What are you talking about?

736
01:09:36,729 --> 01:09:39,930
Look.
The room starts off as a bridge,

737
01:09:40,022 --> 01:09:42,059
and then it moves its way
through the maze,

738
01:09:42,147 --> 01:09:43,604
which is where we ran into it.

739
01:09:43,981 --> 01:09:47,062
But at some point,
it must return to its original position.

740
01:09:47,148 --> 01:09:50,146
- So a bridge is only a bridge.
- For a short period of time.

741
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:53,178
This thing is like
a giant combination lock.

742
01:09:53,274 --> 01:09:55,679
When the rooms are in their
starting position, the lock is open.

743
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:58,263
But when they move
out of alignment, the lock closes.

744
01:09:58,441 --> 01:10:00,349
With a structure this size,
it must take days

745
01:10:00,442 --> 01:10:02,314
for the rooms
to complete a full cycle.

746
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:04,233
So, when does it open?

747
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:14,808
Don't.

748
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:17,933
To find the original coordinates,
the numbers are added together.

749
01:10:18,028 --> 01:10:20,778
To find the permutations, they're
subtracted from one another.

750
01:10:24,029 --> 01:10:24,693
That's it!

751
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:29,353
This room moves to zero,
1 and -1 on the X-axis.

752
01:10:29,488 --> 01:10:31,526
2, 5 and -7 on Y.

753
01:10:32,156 --> 01:10:34,988
And 1, and -1 and zero on Z.

754
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:36,655
And what does that mean?

755
01:10:37,365 --> 01:10:38,644
You suck at math?

756
01:10:39,157 --> 01:10:41,728
Okay, I need the room numbers
around us as reference points.

757
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:48,104
666, 897, 466.

758
01:10:50,117 --> 01:10:54,858
- 567, 898. Okay?
- Yes.

759
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:58,115
And 545.
Did you get that?

760
01:11:02,161 --> 01:11:06,404
656, 778, 462.

761
01:11:07,828 --> 01:11:12,072
That's enough.
X is 17, Y is 25 and Z is 14.

762
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:17,617
Which means
this room makes 2 more moves

763
01:11:17,705 --> 01:11:19,743
before returning
to its original position.

764
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:21,703
- Do we have time?
- Maybe.

765
01:11:21,831 --> 01:11:22,660
Then let's go!

766
01:11:22,956 --> 01:11:24,366
Can you work
the traps into this system?

767
01:11:24,456 --> 01:11:26,447
Fuck the traps.
Let's get to the bridge.

768
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,994
You threw out our last boot,
you fucking idiot.

769
01:11:29,082 --> 01:11:31,950
- Technically, I can identify the traps.
- Technically?

770
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:33,576
At first, I thought
that they were identified

771
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:35,408
by prime numbers,
but they are not.

772
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,953
They are identified by numbers
that are the power of a prime.

773
01:11:38,042 --> 01:11:39,950
- Ok, so?
- Can you calculate that?

774
01:11:40,709 --> 01:11:41,739
The numbers are huge.

775
01:11:41,834 --> 01:11:44,121
But you can, right? She can.

776
01:11:44,251 --> 01:11:46,871
I'd have to calculate
the number of factors in each set.

777
01:11:47,044 --> 01:11:48,287
Maybe if I had a computer.

778
01:11:48,377 --> 01:11:50,119
- You don't need a computer.
- Yes I do.

779
01:11:50,211 --> 01:11:51,787
- Figure it out.
- I can't.

780
01:11:51,878 --> 01:11:54,580
I'm not dying in a fucking rat maze!

781
01:11:55,212 --> 01:11:58,625
Look. Nobody in the whole world
could do it mentally.

782
01:11:58,712 --> 01:12:02,209
Look at the numbers. 567898545.

783
01:12:02,296 --> 01:12:04,168
There's no way I can factor that!

784
01:12:04,255 --> 01:12:09,625
I can't even start on 567!
It's astronomical!

785
01:12:11,673 --> 01:12:12,585
2.

786
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,796
Astronomical.

787
01:12:19,966 --> 01:12:21,163
What did you say?

788
01:12:21,716 --> 01:12:23,956
Astronomical.

789
01:12:24,467 --> 01:12:25,545
Before that.

790
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:28,504
Factors.

791
01:12:29,676 --> 01:12:32,710
How many factors Kazan?
Of 567.

792
01:12:33,385 --> 01:12:34,298
2.

793
01:12:34,927 --> 01:12:36,669
What, are you fucking kidding?

794
01:12:37,469 --> 01:12:40,088
Kazan. How many
factors does 30 have?

795
01:12:40,219 --> 01:12:41,049
3.

796
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,671
- How about 7?
- 1. Gum drop.

797
01:12:45,304 --> 01:12:46,713
I don't have any gum drops.

798
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:48,459
Gum drop.

799
01:12:48,888 --> 01:12:53,593
Kazan. I'll give you a whole box
of gum drops for each answer.

800
01:12:53,972 --> 01:12:56,046
Gum drops come in bags.

801
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:58,255
Okay. You want them in bags,
they are coming in bags.

802
01:12:58,348 --> 01:13:00,753
I don't like the red ones.

803
01:13:03,515 --> 01:13:06,597
- 898.
- 2.

804
01:13:07,933 --> 01:13:11,014
- 545.
- 2.

805
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:12,676
He's giving us the factors.

806
01:13:13,267 --> 01:13:15,507
Astronomical.

807
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,675
You're telling me
telethon boy is a genius?

808
01:13:20,851 --> 01:13:23,138
By those numbers,
the room should be safe.

809
01:13:23,602 --> 01:13:25,392
Only one way to find out.

810
01:13:27,519 --> 01:13:28,349
Don't!

811
01:13:32,979 --> 01:13:33,808
Safe.

812
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:38,559
Kazan, my man.

813
01:13:42,188 --> 01:13:43,812
What's the number, buddy boy?

814
01:13:44,522 --> 01:13:47,853
Hey, right here, look here!

815
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:50,564
Make him do it!

816
01:13:53,732 --> 01:13:56,221
Kazan, we're gonna do
some numbers now, okay?

817
01:13:56,316 --> 01:13:57,939
We like to do numbers, right?

818
01:13:58,441 --> 01:14:00,349
- Prime numbers.
- That's right.

819
01:14:00,692 --> 01:14:03,725
- Can you tell me the factor of 656?
- 2.

820
01:14:04,276 --> 01:14:06,765
- 779?
- 2.

821
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,975
- 462?
- 3.

822
01:14:09,276 --> 01:14:10,556
- Clear.
- Move!

823
01:14:11,443 --> 01:14:14,525
Come on. Come on,
let's go. You too, Worth!

824
01:14:18,278 --> 01:14:21,893
Move your scawny ass, Worth.
I'm not through with you yet.

825
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,564
Leaven, open that door.

826
01:14:23,737 --> 01:14:25,563
Get Einstein
working on the numbers.

827
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:29,859
Oh, jeez.

828
01:14:29,947 --> 01:14:31,404
- Go!
- Worth!

829
01:14:31,572 --> 01:14:33,812
- Hurry!
- Leaven!

830
01:14:37,698 --> 01:14:38,646
563!

831
01:14:39,865 --> 01:14:42,780
- Please, Kazan, 563?
- You fuckers, you're dead!

832
01:14:43,324 --> 01:14:44,983
- 2.
- Clear!

833
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:53,356
- 1.
- Trapped!

834
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:58,610
- Check the floor.
- Is he dead?

835
01:14:59,869 --> 01:15:00,863
Not quite.

836
01:15:01,452 --> 01:15:03,858
Not even close. Worth,
I'm getting out of here and

837
01:15:03,953 --> 01:15:06,276
I'll feed you to
a fucking trap on the way.

838
01:15:15,455 --> 01:15:16,533
Where is he?

839
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:21,821
Come here. I said
come here right nooowwww!!

840
01:15:26,498 --> 01:15:28,785
Gotchya. That way.

841
01:15:31,374 --> 01:15:32,748
- 2.
- Clear!

842
01:15:33,749 --> 01:15:34,780
- 4.
- Clear!

843
01:16:07,589 --> 01:16:10,124
Guess that proves our theory.
Numbers.

844
01:16:10,256 --> 01:16:13,586
- 4, 2, 3.
- Clear.

845
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:25,373
Kazan!

846
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:46,465
Listen.

847
01:16:48,721 --> 01:16:51,210
- He hasn't moved far.
- I'll go find him.

848
01:16:57,055 --> 01:16:58,086
What do you think?

849
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:01,137
You don't have a lot of lives left.

850
01:17:19,143 --> 01:17:22,591
- Kazan!
- I didn't move.

851
01:17:22,685 --> 01:17:24,676
Yeah, good. But you're gonna have
to climb up here, okay?

852
01:17:24,769 --> 01:17:26,309
I don't like that.

853
01:17:41,313 --> 01:17:45,770
14, 26, 14.

854
01:17:46,189 --> 01:17:48,393
Worth, get back here right now!

855
01:17:48,481 --> 01:17:49,974
Five bags of gum drops.

856
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:52,814
27 bags total.

857
01:17:52,898 --> 01:17:54,142
27 bags. Deal.

858
01:17:55,232 --> 01:17:58,433
This room's next move
takes it to the bridge!

859
01:17:58,649 --> 01:17:59,728
We're coming!

860
01:18:02,733 --> 01:18:03,563
Over here!

861
01:18:04,484 --> 01:18:08,181
Move it! We don't have
much time. Come on.

862
01:18:40,407 --> 01:18:42,197
Worth? Worth?

863
01:18:45,241 --> 01:18:46,698
This better be it.

864
01:18:47,866 --> 01:18:48,897
It should be.

865
01:18:57,201 --> 01:18:57,983
Where?

866
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:10,776
Oh, well!

867
01:19:14,204 --> 01:19:16,112
Give me a minute. Be patient.

868
01:19:17,413 --> 01:19:19,653
- So, guess what?
- No.

869
01:19:21,164 --> 01:19:23,202
This is the room we started in.

870
01:19:24,248 --> 01:19:28,289
I was right. We should
never have moved in the first place.

871
01:19:52,127 --> 01:19:53,371
The bridge.

872
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:55,493
Red.

873
01:19:56,211 --> 01:19:57,242
Kazan?

874
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:04,708
- 4, 2, 4.
- Clear!

875
01:21:07,224 --> 01:21:08,053
Worth!

876
01:21:11,849 --> 01:21:12,798
Go ahead.

877
01:21:13,433 --> 01:21:14,511
What are you doing?

878
01:21:14,725 --> 01:21:16,266
You can't quit now.

879
01:21:20,601 --> 01:21:22,592
It's not your fault!

880
01:21:23,101 --> 01:21:27,475
I have nothing to live for out there.

881
01:21:30,686 --> 01:21:31,965
What is out there?

882
01:21:44,855 --> 01:21:47,474
Boundless human stupidity.

883
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:55,517
I can live with that.

884
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:15,895
Noooooo!!!

885
01:22:20,736 --> 01:22:22,526
Kazan! Get out through the door!

886
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:52,729
Red, Kazan.
