1
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,207
I LOVE YOU

2
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:18,386
4th OF JULY CROAKER FESTIVAL

3
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:33,735
Let's welcome back
our six finalists to the stage.

4
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:38,990
They're pretty as can be,
aren't they?

5
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:44,162
You worked hard. Your parents
worked hard. We're proud of you.

6
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:57,384
She was born for this.

7
00:04:57,551 --> 00:05:04,140
- Her breasts are so... ample.
- She does exercises to pump 'em up.

8
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:10,230
Guys, I'm on sexist overload
as it is. Kill the commentary.

9
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:14,818
"In the spirit of Mother Teresa,
what will be your contribution -

10
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:19,447
- to your community
and the world at large?"

11
00:05:19,614 --> 00:05:26,913
At summer's end, I plan to become
a serious actress in New York City.

12
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:34,212
By entertaining the world through
art, I shall serve my country.

13
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:41,428
Did you feed her this shit?

14
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:46,933
Work it. Babe!
They're eating it up.

15
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:59,279
And this year's Croaker Queen is:
Miss Helen Shivers.

16
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:08,955
That's my girl!

17
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:16,087
That's my girlfriend!

18
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:55,585
- How's my hair?
- Hurricane-proof.

19
00:06:55,752 --> 00:07:00,298
It's all about hair. Don't forget it
when you become a big lawyer.

20
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:05,428
Professional women think it's all
about brains, and ignore the "do".

21
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:09,015
The "do" is vital. Got it.

22
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:14,980
- Are you riding with me?
- No. Tell Mom I'll be home late.

23
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:21,778
- Is Miss Croaker gonna get sautéed?
- A twit with a wit.

24
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:31,788
- Julie. A shooter on the house.
- I can't get past the slime.

25
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:36,376
How about I take you out
before you leave town?

26
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:44,050
I don't think so. Max.

27
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:48,638
We've been friends since forever.
You can't leave without a farewell.

28
00:07:50,182 --> 00:07:53,643
A toast... to us.

29
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:59,858
To our last summer of immature.
Adolescent decadence.

30
00:08:00,942 --> 00:08:06,615
- Somebody's buzzed.
- Chum bait. Take a hike.

31
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:12,954
- Easy, easy!
- Barry, they're just friends.

32
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:17,501
Come on. This is tired.

33
00:08:18,835 --> 00:08:24,716
- I'm just taking care of your girl.
- Thanks, buddy. Let's blow.

34
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:30,055
Let's beam down to Dawson's Beach.
A little joyride.

35
00:08:35,185 --> 00:08:38,230
Bye.

36
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:54,412
They're making out
when they hear over the radio -

37
00:08:54,579 --> 00:09:00,627
- that a killer with a hook for a
hand escaped from the insane asylum.

38
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:07,634
- You're telling it wrong.
- Shut up. The girl gets all scared.

39
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:12,556
She wants to go home.
The boy gets pissed and peels out.

40
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:17,435
No, the boy goes for help
and the girl stays in the car.

41
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:24,442
- She hears a scratching sound...
- It's not a scratch, it's a drip.

42
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:29,948
No, the guy's been hung from a tree.
His feet are scratching the roof.

43
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:36,288
No, he's been decapitated,
and the blood's dripping on the car.

44
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:41,126
No, he wasn't decapitated,
he was gutted with a hook.

45
00:09:43,962 --> 00:09:48,300
- That's the way I heard it.
- You're all wrong.

46
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:54,764
They get to the girl's house and
find a bloody hook in the car door.

47
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:59,519
That's the original story.
That's the way it really happened.

48
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:03,523
None of it really happened.
It's a bullshit story.

49
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:09,988
- No. It's not. It's true.
- I don't think so, Ray.

50
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:14,618
It's a fictional story to warn girls
of the dangers of premarital sex.

51
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:23,126
You know how terrified I am of
your I.Q., but it's an urban legend.

52
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:29,132
And they all originate from
some sort of real-life incident.

53
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:49,319
By that time I'll be finishing my
two-year deal on "Guiding Light", -

54
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:55,992
- coinciding with your first year
as quarterback for the Steelers.

55
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:02,082
Then we can elope to Europe
or the Caymans, -

56
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:06,670
- where I'll let you impregnate me
with the first of three children. -

57
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:11,007
- before you head off to rehab.

58
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:15,971
Then we can live happily...
blah. Blah. Blah.

59
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,185
Ray? Where did you go?

60
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:26,606
I'm gonna hook you!

61
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:31,653
- Do you really believe that crap?
- It's true.

62
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,783
The hook is really a phallic symbol.
Ultimately castrated.

63
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:41,121
I'm gonna miss you.

64
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:45,917
You can always ditch Boston
and come to New York with me.

65
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:51,298
We can't all sit in coffee-houses
and ramble on our laptops.

66
00:11:51,464 --> 00:11:57,137
- Nobody gets me the way you do.
- I understand your pain.

67
00:11:57,304 --> 00:12:00,265
I hate this.

68
00:12:00,432 --> 00:12:06,479
You're gonna fall for a head-shaven,
body-piercing philosophy student.

69
00:12:06,646 --> 00:12:12,819
- That sounds attractive.
- I'll never see you again.

70
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:19,659
High-school relationships are more
successful than any other kind.

71
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:24,247
Cite your source.

72
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,262
Are you sure?

73
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,999
- Give me the keys.
- Nobody drives my car but me.

74
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:13,004
I know, baby, but the Croaker Queen
has to get home now.

75
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:17,467
- Hey, you two.
- Give me my fucking keys.

76
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:22,472
Come ride in the back with me.
I'll let you do things to me.

77
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,352
- Nobody drives my car but me.
- Get in the car.

78
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:44,828
You can't drive for shit.

79
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:49,541
Can you say "alcoholic"?

80
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:58,633
What the hell is this crap?

81
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:17,861
What's wrong with you?

82
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:21,573
Watch out!

83
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:32,542
- What was that?
- Is everybody okay?

84
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:37,547
- I think it was an animal.
- You're bleeding.

85
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:43,053
- It's not mine.
- It must have been a dog.

86
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,973
Jesus Christ, my fucking car!

87
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:56,066
- Can't you see where you're going?
- It came out of nowhere.

88
00:14:56,233 --> 00:15:00,403
- A dog couldn't have done that.
- A deer could.

89
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:05,158
- My dad's gonna freak on my ass.
- It was an accident.

90
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:10,288
- If it was a deer. Where is it?
- Maybe it ran off.

91
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:15,168
- I hope we didn't kill it.
- Oh, my God...

92
00:15:22,926 --> 00:15:26,179
- No way.
- I thought...

93
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:30,600
- I didn't see it.
- There's no way.

94
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:33,770
This isn't happening.

95
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:40,777
Check that side.

96
00:15:50,412 --> 00:15:55,000
I couldn't see it.
I swear!

97
00:15:55,167 --> 00:16:01,131
<i>- Is he dead?
- Check his pulse. You rammed him!</i>

98
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:26,448
I think he's dead.

99
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:35,373
- Who is he?
- His face is all messed up.

100
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,879
- What was he doing out here?
- We've got to get an ambulance.

101
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:43,965
What's your hurry?

102
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:48,512
- The guy's dead.
- You're not a doctor.

103
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:52,849
Use your brain, Julie.
If we call the police, we're fucked.

104
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:56,728
- It was an accident.
- Let's think about this.

105
00:16:56,895 --> 00:17:02,692
Think about what? He crossed
the road in the middle of the night.

106
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:08,406
- You weren't drinking or speeding.
- They won't believe I was driving.

107
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:13,995
- It's my car. They'll nail my ass.
- That's not true.

108
00:17:14,162 --> 00:17:17,791
I'm drunk as shit. I'm fucked!

109
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,294
We'll call the police
and tell the truth.

110
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:25,632
It's manslaughter.

111
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:31,012
- We're gonna fry no matter what.
- Then we leave now.

112
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:33,849
Are you crazy?

113
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:38,353
- The grille's busted and bloody.
- We can clean it up.

114
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,110
- We're going to the police!
- We don't have time for your shit!

115
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:50,198
Let's try to stay calm.

116
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:57,038
<i>If there's some of the car on him.
You're looking at a hit-and-run!</i>

117
00:17:58,081 --> 00:18:02,127
- Then we dump the body.
- You've lost it.

118
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:06,715
- Let's pretend we were never here.
- We'll dump him in the water.

119
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,137
When they find him,
the evidence will be washed away.

120
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:16,099
If they found him at all.

121
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:22,772
Maybe the undertow could carry him
out to sea.

122
00:18:22,939 --> 00:18:26,193
I won't be any part of it.

123
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:29,654
I'm scared. Julie.
I'm not like the rest of you.

124
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:36,161
I don't have the family or money
to get me out of this. Please.

125
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:44,336
This is your future, Julie. Think
about college. Your scholarship.

126
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:50,634
The guy's already dead. If we go
to the police, we're dead too.

127
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:02,771
- What do we do?
- Help me.

128
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:11,780
They're slowing down.

129
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:14,866
- Who is it?
- It's Max.

130
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:18,995
Get rid of him.

131
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,713
- Have you got car trouble?
- Actually...

132
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:34,553
Barry had too much to drink. We
don't want upchuck in the new car.

133
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:39,266
- It doesn't look so new anymore.
- Yeah. Don't drink and drive.

134
00:19:39,432 --> 00:19:42,102
Daddy's gonna be mad.

135
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:50,527
- What can I do for you, Max?
- Wipe that grin off your face.

136
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:59,661
Okay, Max, will do.
Have a good night.

137
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:06,168
- You got that rich boy act down.
- We'll be seeing you.

138
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:13,091
Take care. Julie.

139
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:04,434
Even if his body washes ashore, -

140
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:09,022
- he'll be eaten by crabs
and small fish.

141
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:12,901
Maybe we'll get lucky with a shark.

142
00:21:13,985 --> 00:21:17,489
Take him to the side.

143
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,079
Put him down.

144
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:33,797
- Let's do it.
- Wait.

145
00:21:33,964 --> 00:21:38,593
- Should we find out who he is?
- Why?

146
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,056
- Just to know.
- I don't want to know.

147
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:48,103
Let's just pretend he's an escaped
lunatic with a hook. Ray, help me.

148
00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:58,196
- I don't think I can.
- Barry, it's not too late.

149
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- You, just shut up!
- Christ. I'll do it.

150
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:10,500
Get him off me!

151
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:15,839
My crown!
He's got my crown!

152
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

153
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,579
Over here!

154
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:06,139
- Let's get out of here.
- We're going home now.

155
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:14,439
Never, under any circumstances,
speak about this again.

156
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:20,111
It's now merely
a future therapy bill. Agreed?

157
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:27,953
- I'll never mention it again.
- We'll make a pact.

158
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:32,082
We take this to our grave.

159
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:35,710
Julie?

160
00:23:37,295 --> 00:23:41,883
- Don't nod! You fucking say it!
- Yeah, okay.

161
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,763
- "We take this to our grave."
- Let her go.

162
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:53,103
- You fucking say it.
- We take this to the grave.

163
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:05,156
It'll be okay.

164
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:32,809
ONE YEAR LATER

165
00:24:48,992 --> 00:24:51,578
It's time to go.

166
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:59,377
Move your tired, ugly ass.
We're late.

167
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:02,464
I changed my mind.

168
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:07,677
<i>Get your white-as-death corpse
in the car.</i>

169
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:14,601
Come on!

170
00:25:14,768 --> 00:25:19,689
You're going home for the summer
to get a tan on your pale tail.

171
00:25:21,858 --> 00:25:24,069
Let's go.

172
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:52,222
Remember. Sun and fun.

173
00:25:58,228 --> 00:26:01,898
Julie? Welcome home. Dear.

174
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:09,656
I missed you.

175
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,662
How's the snapper?

176
00:26:17,414 --> 00:26:21,877
I really wanted monkfish,
but it's been a bad season.

177
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:29,092
- Are you on drugs?
- What?

178
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:32,512
I just wanted an honest reaction.

179
00:26:33,513 --> 00:26:38,643
No, Mom. No drugs.

180
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:44,608
Then what is wrong?
You look like death.

181
00:26:45,358 --> 00:26:48,445
I've had a rough year.

182
00:27:10,383 --> 00:27:12,469
CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT

183
00:27:13,887 --> 00:27:20,143
You got some mail.
Your report card came last week.

184
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:24,314
I know it looks bad.
But the summer session went well.

185
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:30,487
- It's also your last chance.
- It's not that serious.

186
00:27:30,654 --> 00:27:33,615
What happened to my daughter?

187
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:39,079
You went away,
and you don't call or visit.

188
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:43,333
Your father must be turning over
in his grave.

189
00:27:59,182 --> 00:28:02,185
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID
LAST SUMMER!

190
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,075
Who sent this? There's
no postmark or return address.

191
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:21,746
- Why? What does it say?
- Nothing.

192
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:55,131
Guys, easy...
It's called glass. It breaks.

193
00:29:58,176 --> 00:30:01,012
Good morning.

194
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:12,357
Well, look what the cat drug in.

195
00:30:12,524 --> 00:30:18,446
Elsa. Hi. I need to talk to Helen.
Can you give me her New York number?

196
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:22,909
- Her New York number?
- Yeah. I need to talk to her.

197
00:30:23,076 --> 00:30:29,791
Helen doesn't have a New York
number. Try Women's Fragrances.

198
00:30:33,587 --> 00:30:37,048
Frightening, isn't it?

199
00:30:37,215 --> 00:30:40,802
Julie.

200
00:30:43,013 --> 00:30:47,100
- When did you get home?
- Yesterday.

201
00:30:47,267 --> 00:30:52,647
- It's good to see you.
- What happened to New York?

202
00:30:52,814 --> 00:30:57,235
I went for a while.
It didn't really work out.

203
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,161
Somebody sent this to me.

204
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:10,582
- Somebody knows.
- How?

205
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:15,712
- I don't know.
- We were so careful.

206
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:20,675
What if somebody else
was there that night?

207
00:31:20,842 --> 00:31:24,930
- Who? It's been a year.
- I don't know.

208
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:29,976
Has Barry seen this?

209
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:36,316
<i>- Do you ever see Barry at school?
- It's a big campus. He is back?</i>

210
00:31:37,275 --> 00:31:42,614
- I saw his car at the gym.
- Did you guys break up?

211
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:49,204
What are you two doing here?

212
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:56,044
Hi, Barry.

213
00:32:01,842 --> 00:32:07,764
"I know what you did last summer."
What a crock of shit.

214
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:14,604
- We need help.
- I'll say, you two look like shit.

215
00:32:14,771 --> 00:32:17,190
You're a prick.

216
00:32:17,357 --> 00:32:23,238
- We can't just ignore it.
- How do you know it's related?

217
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:27,284
- You did a lot last summer.
- Only one murder comes to mind.

218
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,328
You shut the hell up!

219
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:38,753
- We didn't murder anyone.
- He was still alive.

220
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,257
He was in the middle of the road.

221
00:32:42,424 --> 00:32:46,219
- His name was David Egan.
- Who?

222
00:32:46,386 --> 00:32:52,809
David Egan. He was found
three weeks after we...

223
00:32:52,976 --> 00:32:59,816
His body was caught in a shrimp net.
It was in the paper.

224
00:32:59,983 --> 00:33:04,571
I think the police called it
an accidental drowning.

225
00:33:04,738 --> 00:33:09,075
But he died because of us.
That's certain.

226
00:33:12,204 --> 00:33:18,502
What about Ray? Have you shown
the letter to him? What does he say?

227
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:23,715
We broke up last summer. Last
I heard, he was working up north.

228
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:33,642
Let's suppose someone was there.
Why send a letter one year later?

229
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:37,896
It's probably some crack
fucking around.

230
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:44,110
Max.

231
00:33:44,277 --> 00:33:48,198
- Max, you think?
- Who else? He was there.

232
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,416
You two wait here.
I know what I'm doing.

233
00:34:05,048 --> 00:34:10,387
Go figure. I was just wondering
what happened to that Barry Cox.

234
00:34:10,554 --> 00:34:17,686
Hey, Max. Can we talk a second,
in private?

235
00:34:17,853 --> 00:34:21,898
This isn't private enough for you?

236
00:34:27,737 --> 00:34:29,823
What?

237
00:34:31,658 --> 00:34:34,077
We got your letter.

238
00:34:34,244 --> 00:34:38,248
- Don't fuck with me. You saw us.
- What the fuck are you on?

239
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:44,462
I'll say this once. I'll kill you.
I have no problem with that.

240
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:47,883
- Get off of me!
- Understand?

241
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:05,775
Motherfucker.
Don't you test me.

242
00:35:05,942 --> 00:35:09,029
I'll call the cops on your ass.

243
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:15,577
- Did he admit to the letter?
- He won't bother you anymore.

244
00:35:15,744 --> 00:35:19,998
I scared the shit out of him.

245
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:24,336
Well. I'll be damned.

246
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:33,637
So Ray's a fisherman.

247
00:35:33,803 --> 00:35:39,142
Yeah, almost a year now.
I work on that one over there.

248
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:41,520
That's nice.

249
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:46,483
Have a nice life, guys.
I'm out of here.

250
00:35:49,194 --> 00:35:52,155
Have you got a minute?

251
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:59,329
I've got to get back to work.
Call me, we can get together.

252
00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:10,382
We need to talk.

253
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,595
- And you think Max sent it?
- Barry does.

254
00:36:15,762 --> 00:36:23,103
He's probably just screwing around.
He doesn't have much else to do.

255
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:31,236
- So... how's school?
- So, you're a fisherman.

256
00:36:31,403 --> 00:36:35,699
Prophecy fulfilled.
I've become my father.

257
00:36:35,866 --> 00:36:41,329
- I didn't think you knew your dad.
- All I know is he worked the boats.

258
00:36:43,123 --> 00:36:48,420
I know you hold me responsible
for what happened last summer.

259
00:36:48,587 --> 00:36:55,969
No, I'm responsible for
my own actions. I don't blame you.

260
00:36:57,429 --> 00:37:02,726
But I don't want to know you either.

261
00:39:05,974 --> 00:39:09,102
Hello?

262
00:39:37,964 --> 00:39:41,259
Hello?

263
00:39:50,644 --> 00:39:53,313
I KNOW

264
00:40:30,183 --> 00:40:33,103
My fucking jacket!

265
00:40:35,647 --> 00:40:39,276
Hank, is anybody else here?

266
00:40:39,442 --> 00:40:42,863
Just you and me.

267
00:40:47,576 --> 00:40:50,412
You fucker!

268
00:40:59,754 --> 00:41:01,464
Max, you're fucking dead.

269
00:41:01,464 --> 00:41:02,799
Max, you're fucking dead.

270
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,482
Help me!

271
00:42:00,649 --> 00:42:05,654
Help me! Somebody!

272
00:42:11,743 --> 00:42:15,497
What do you want?

273
00:42:22,504 --> 00:42:28,468
I'm sorry.
I swear. We didn't mean it.

274
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:35,308
One moment please, Officer.

275
00:42:43,233 --> 00:42:48,280
- Julie...
- What happened?

276
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,368
No. For the fortieth time.
I couldn't see his face.

277
00:42:53,535 --> 00:42:57,539
Somebody tried to kill you.
We have to go to the police.

278
00:42:57,706 --> 00:43:03,003
If he wanted me dead. He could
have done it. He's fucking with us.

279
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,339
- Who is?
- Some guy in a slicker.

280
00:43:06,506 --> 00:43:09,968
That narrows it down.
This being a fishing village.

281
00:43:10,135 --> 00:43:15,640
Since you bring it up...
You have a slicker.

282
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:22,647
- You're not gonna throw this on me.
- This isn't getting us anywhere.

283
00:43:26,776 --> 00:43:30,071
Maybe we should come clean.

284
00:43:30,238 --> 00:43:34,701
No. We made a pact,
and we're gonna keep it.

285
00:43:34,868 --> 00:43:39,289
That's insane. Look at us.
The secret's killing us.

286
00:43:39,456 --> 00:43:42,209
We're not going to the police.

287
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:47,214
We can put an end to it, and
salvage a small fraction of a life.

288
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:54,971
It was murder. Julie.
Your words. Remember? Murder.

289
00:43:56,765 --> 00:44:01,853
- We find this guy and fix him up.
- Like last night?

290
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:07,609
He's right. This guy won't go to the
police. We'll find him, talk to him.

291
00:44:09,778 --> 00:44:12,614
How do we find him?

292
00:44:12,781 --> 00:44:17,911
It has to be a friend or family
member of... What was his name?

293
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:27,254
- David Egan.
- Right. David Egan.

294
00:44:29,381 --> 00:44:32,634
It could still be Max.

295
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:37,931
- Then find him. Prove Barry wrong.
- I just want for you and me...

296
00:44:38,098 --> 00:44:43,186
Listen to me. Get something.
There is no "you and me".

297
00:44:54,072 --> 00:44:59,327
I can access the local library
and pull up all we need to know.

298
00:44:59,494 --> 00:45:02,122
Egan... David.

299
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:09,921
- All these articles are about him?
- Yeah. Or at least mention him.

300
00:45:11,923 --> 00:45:15,343
Wait. July 5th, two years ago.
What's this?

301
00:45:16,178 --> 00:45:21,892
"Susie Willis drowned, trapped in
a car near Dawson's Beach."

302
00:45:22,058 --> 00:45:26,313
- "The driver, Egan, was unharmed."
- I remember that wreck.

303
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:31,067
Susie was engaged to David.

304
00:45:31,234 --> 00:45:35,363
Her name was tattooed on his arm.
I saw it.

305
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:41,703
"Survived by his mother, Claire, and
sister, Melissa, of Maribel County."

306
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:45,957
They live in the sticks.
What do you think?

307
00:45:46,124 --> 00:45:48,752
What have we got to lose?

308
00:45:54,049 --> 00:45:57,344
Turn right...
Back there.

309
00:46:09,648 --> 00:46:15,403
Do we just say, "We killed your son
and we were nearby, so..."

310
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,697
We play it by ear.

311
00:46:17,864 --> 00:46:22,577
Angela Lansbury always had a plan.

312
00:46:32,379 --> 00:46:36,091
What if they recognize us?
They could shoot us.

313
00:46:36,258 --> 00:46:39,761
They could've done that already.

314
00:46:39,928 --> 00:46:43,390
Jodie Foster tried this.
A serial killer opened the door.

315
00:46:57,737 --> 00:47:01,116
Well, it was a good try.

316
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Adding "breaking and entering"
to our crimes?

317
00:47:15,922 --> 00:47:19,843
Can I help you?

318
00:47:22,053 --> 00:47:27,517
Hi. Our car stalled down the road.
Can we use your phone?

319
00:47:37,152 --> 00:47:41,615
- The phone's over there.
- Thanks.

320
00:47:41,781 --> 00:47:46,745
Jodie.
Will you call Triple-A?

321
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You got it... Angela.

322
00:48:08,183 --> 00:48:12,562
My name is Missy Egan.
Are you girls from Maribel?

323
00:48:12,729 --> 00:48:16,316
- No, Southport.
- I went to Southport High.

324
00:48:16,483 --> 00:48:21,655
- You looked familiar. What year?
- Class of '88.

325
00:48:21,822 --> 00:48:28,328
Your name, "Egan", sounds familiar.
Did you have a brother?

326
00:48:28,495 --> 00:48:31,873
I did, but he was younger than me.
David.

327
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,127
- What class was he?
- '92. But he died last July.

328
00:48:36,294 --> 00:48:40,882
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

329
00:48:41,049 --> 00:48:45,554
Do you live alone?

330
00:48:46,513 --> 00:48:49,266
Yeah. I do.

331
00:48:49,432 --> 00:48:54,604
My daddy died a long time ago
and my mother's in a home.

332
00:48:54,771 --> 00:48:59,067
She didn't take too well
to what happened to David.

333
00:48:59,234 --> 00:49:03,780
Things haven't been the same
since he died.

334
00:49:07,742 --> 00:49:10,662
They're on their way.

335
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:15,292
I could make you guys a cup of tea
while you're waiting.

336
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:19,504
- Thanks.
- That's nice of you.

337
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:39,774
I think I remember David.
He had a friend. What was his name?

338
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:44,362
Didn't he hang out with this guy...?
What was his name?

339
00:49:44,529 --> 00:49:49,409
I didn't know too many
of David's friends.

340
00:49:51,786 --> 00:49:54,998
There was one guy...

341
00:49:55,165 --> 00:50:03,215
He stopped by not too long after
David's death, to pay his respects.

342
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:09,221
He was a really nice guy.
He was cute and smart and...

343
00:50:10,347 --> 00:50:16,269
We were sweet on each other for
a minute or so. But it didn't work.

344
00:50:16,436 --> 00:50:21,399
He never said it. But I think
it hurt him to be around me.

345
00:50:23,985 --> 00:50:28,573
- Where is this old friend now?
- Oh. I don't know.

346
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:32,118
- Do you remember his name?
- Billy.

347
00:50:32,285 --> 00:50:36,540
- Did he have a last name?
- Blue. Billy Blue.

348
00:50:37,499 --> 00:50:44,047
- We should wait back at the car.
- Don't be ridiculous. Stay.

349
00:50:44,214 --> 00:50:48,885
- I don't want to miss Triple-A.
- We appreciate the phone.

350
00:50:49,052 --> 00:50:53,306
Any time. I don't get
too many knocks on my door nowadays.

351
00:50:53,473 --> 00:50:58,019
- Are you okay?
- I wigged out. I'm sorry.

352
00:50:59,521 --> 00:51:04,901
Being in his house
and seeing his sister...

353
00:51:05,652 --> 00:51:11,575
- God, do you see what we've done?
- It was an accident.

354
00:51:13,827 --> 00:51:18,081
We killed a man. Then ruined
the lives of everyone he knew.

355
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
We're not that powerful.
You're giving us too much credit.

356
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:32,596
- You forgot your cigarettes.
- Thank you.

357
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:40,854
- I see you got the car started.
- Yeah, it started right up.

358
00:51:41,021 --> 00:51:44,608
Funny how that happens.

359
00:52:02,459 --> 00:52:08,256
- So what now?
- Now we try and find Billy Blue.

360
00:52:13,386 --> 00:52:17,265
Maybe he wanted to die.

361
00:52:17,432 --> 00:52:21,102
- What?
- David Egan.

362
00:52:21,269 --> 00:52:26,107
His girlfriend died on the same
road, July 4th, one year earlier.

363
00:52:26,274 --> 00:52:31,363
Maybe he was sitting in the road,
waiting for us to hit him.

364
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:36,034
Yeah, if that will help you
sleep at night.

365
00:52:37,327 --> 00:52:42,290
What happened between us?
We used to be best friends.

366
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:46,503
We used to be a lot of things.

367
00:52:47,546 --> 00:52:50,674
I miss you.

368
00:53:31,506 --> 00:53:33,884
Hey, Dad.

369
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

370
00:55:48,101 --> 00:55:52,731
Is the washed-up has-been
having a moment?

371
00:55:54,608 --> 00:55:57,235
What do you want?

372
00:55:57,402 --> 00:56:01,740
We're doing inventory tomorrow.
I need you there by 10.

373
00:56:01,907 --> 00:56:07,162
I can't. I'm in the parade tomorrow.

374
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:13,251
Dad put me in charge of the store,
and I want you there by 10.

375
00:56:13,418 --> 00:56:17,839
The outgoing queen
has to ride in the parade.

376
00:56:18,006 --> 00:56:21,718
It's tradition.
There's nothing I can do about it.

377
00:56:23,136 --> 00:56:28,058
You and your hair...
It's so pathetic.

378
00:56:28,225 --> 00:56:33,647
- You can leave now.
- So very pathetic.

379
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:55,437
SOON

380
00:58:04,154 --> 00:58:09,117
What?
Oh, my God...

381
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

382
00:59:24,025 --> 00:59:26,736
Max...

383
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:53,847
- Are you sure he was dead?
- I saw him... with these crabs.

384
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:58,226
You do it.

385
01:00:09,404 --> 01:00:14,868
He was there. And he was
wearing yourjacket, Barry.

386
01:00:15,035 --> 01:00:20,582
- Did the crabs carry him away?
- I believe you, Julie.

387
01:00:20,749 --> 01:00:24,878
- He took the body.
- Why would he do that?

388
01:00:25,045 --> 01:00:30,926
Why did he try to run you over,
and make coleslaw on Helen's head?

389
01:00:31,092 --> 01:00:35,931
- Let's go back to the house.
- Where's yourjacket, Barry?

390
01:00:36,097 --> 01:00:43,271
Don't you see? He's got us.
We can't go to the police now.

391
01:00:43,438 --> 01:00:48,485
He's watching us and waiting.
What are you waiting for?

392
01:00:49,069 --> 01:00:53,365
What are you waiting for?

393
01:00:58,286 --> 01:01:00,372
What are you doing here?

394
01:01:00,539 --> 01:01:04,042
- I've been looking for you guys.
- You're gonna die.

395
01:01:05,335 --> 01:01:09,089
- Stop it.
- I didn't do anything.

396
01:01:09,256 --> 01:01:13,176
- You're fucking lying!
- Leave him alone. Get a grip.

397
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:19,349
- Wake up, Julie. He's behind this.
- He's after me. Too.

398
01:01:21,268 --> 01:01:24,396
I got a letter.

399
01:01:24,563 --> 01:01:29,109
A letter? I got run over,
Helen gets her hair chopped off, -

400
01:01:29,276 --> 01:01:35,157
- Julie gets a body in a trunk, and
you get a letter. That's balanced.

401
01:01:35,323 --> 01:01:40,370
- You killed Max and took my jacket.
- Max is dead?

402
01:01:40,537 --> 01:01:47,043
You always wanted to be our friend,
but were too jealous to handle it.

403
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:50,380
Fuck you.

404
01:01:50,547 --> 01:01:55,051
We have to stick together.
Help each other.

405
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:06,188
So if it's not fisherboy here,
who is it?

406
01:02:06,354 --> 01:02:11,860
- We think his name is Billy Blue.
- How do you know that?

407
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:16,364
- David had a friend by that name.
- He's probably a school friend.

408
01:02:16,531 --> 01:02:20,660
According to his sister,
that would make him class of '92.

409
01:02:20,827 --> 01:02:25,207
Elsa was class of '92. Maybe
there's something in her yearbook.

410
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:29,669
It's hard to believe that's the guy.

411
01:02:29,836 --> 01:02:32,506
His face isn't splattered
on the road.

412
01:02:34,257 --> 01:02:41,556
- Maybe Blue's not his real name.
- He could have lied to Missy.

413
01:02:41,723 --> 01:02:45,769
- If we bring the book to Missy...
- She could point him out.

414
01:02:45,936 --> 01:02:49,606
I'm not going anywhere.

415
01:02:50,899 --> 01:02:54,528
High school mugshots...

416
01:02:55,695 --> 01:03:00,408
- I'll go. You've got that parade.
- Forget it.

417
01:03:00,575 --> 01:03:04,287
- You have to, in case he shows up.
- I don't want him to!

418
01:03:04,454 --> 01:03:08,583
This could be our chance.
We could catch him.

419
01:03:09,793 --> 01:03:14,589
I'll go to Missy's. Barry, you go
with Helen. If he shows up...

420
01:03:14,756 --> 01:03:17,259
I'll pound his ass.

421
01:03:17,425 --> 01:03:21,221
- You sound like vigilantes.
- It's July 4th, Ray.

422
01:03:21,388 --> 01:03:26,268
Whatever he has planned is gonna
happen today, unless we stop him.

423
01:03:26,434 --> 01:03:32,524
Don't you see? It's that moment
where we have to make a decision.

424
01:03:33,316 --> 01:03:38,864
- Let's make the right one.
- I'll do what's smart, not right.

425
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:42,659
Then let's go.
Leave town. Disappear.

426
01:03:42,826 --> 01:03:46,454
<i>I have disappeared.
Now I want my life back.</i>

427
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:54,212
We have to face this.
What's it gonna be, Ray?

428
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:05,283
Barry.

429
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:09,579
Over there!

430
01:05:37,357 --> 01:05:39,818
Where the hell is he?

431
01:06:08,638 --> 01:06:12,017
Missy?

432
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

433
01:07:12,118 --> 01:07:16,206
Please.
Missy...

434
01:07:16,373 --> 01:07:22,170
Do you remember me
from the other day? The car trouble?

435
01:07:22,337 --> 01:07:24,464
What are you doing here?

436
01:08:04,004 --> 01:08:07,716
Please. We need to talk.

437
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:12,095
I need to find
your brother's friend. Billy Blue.

438
01:08:12,262 --> 01:08:17,392
- Can you look through the yearbook?
- What's this all about?

439
01:08:17,559 --> 01:08:23,815
It has to do with your brother
and last July 4th.

440
01:08:23,982 --> 01:08:29,613
- What about it?
- What happened wasn't an accident.

441
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:33,909
- I know.
- You know what?

442
01:08:34,075 --> 01:08:36,912
He killed himself.

443
01:08:38,497 --> 01:08:42,876
He went up there to die
where Susie died.

444
01:08:43,043 --> 01:08:47,506
The whole town blamed him
for her death.

445
01:08:47,672 --> 01:08:53,303
- So he blamed himself.
- How do you know it was suicide?

446
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:56,056
He left a note.

447
01:08:57,265 --> 01:09:03,438
I hid it from the insurance company.
They don't pay if it's suicide.

448
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:12,489
That don't much matter anymore,
because the money's been spent.

449
01:09:12,656 --> 01:09:14,783
I WILL NEVER FORGET
LAST SUMMER

450
01:09:16,493 --> 01:09:20,789
This isn't a suicide note.
It's a death threat.

451
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:26,294
- What are you talking about?
- Your brother didn't kill himself.

452
01:09:26,461 --> 01:09:31,341
I saw him. I was there and
whoever sent this was there too.

453
01:09:31,508 --> 01:09:35,887
- Where did you see him?
- We hit him. It was an accident.

454
01:09:36,596 --> 01:09:41,059
- My brother drowned.
- "Susie" was tattooed on his arm.

455
01:09:41,226 --> 01:09:45,814
He doesn't have a tattoo.
You didn't see anything. Get out!

456
01:09:48,733 --> 01:09:52,487
Get out of my house.

457
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:02,664
Oh, my God...

458
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:06,585
It wasn't your brother.

459
01:10:27,481 --> 01:10:34,988
- I'll be up in the balcony.
- He had a big, huge hook.

460
01:10:37,073 --> 01:10:42,662
Everything's going to be all right.
I won't let anything happen to you.

461
01:10:45,373 --> 01:10:47,709
Nicely done, ladies.

462
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:52,589
Now, let's meet last year's winner:
Miss Helen Shivers.

463
01:11:08,438 --> 01:11:13,944
As we continue our pageant,
we move into the talent competition.

464
01:11:52,315 --> 01:11:55,360
Oh. Jesus.

465
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,205
Barry!

466
01:12:12,419 --> 01:12:15,505
Somebody help him!

467
01:12:29,561 --> 01:12:32,230
Excuse me.

468
01:12:32,397 --> 01:12:37,277
- What's the problem?
- He's gonna kill him!

469
01:12:37,444 --> 01:12:41,031
- Up in the balcony.
- Everybody stay calm.

470
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:44,659
Get off of me!

471
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,711
Stay behind me.

472
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:09,184
Nobody's up here. This is not
my idea of a funny joke.

473
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:14,105
The fisherman was here.
He killed Barry.

474
01:13:14,272 --> 01:13:19,194
There's nobody up here.
Let's go back downstairs.

475
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:27,077
Watch your step.

476
01:13:27,244 --> 01:13:32,249
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, false alarm.
We'll resume in a few minutes.</i>

477
01:13:37,337 --> 01:13:42,551
I'm gonna take you home.
Your parents are worried about you.

478
01:13:42,717 --> 01:13:46,429
You have to believe me.

479
01:13:47,347 --> 01:13:50,809
Let me take you home.

480
01:13:53,728 --> 01:13:59,860
Excuse me.
We'll be needing this.

481
01:14:06,825 --> 01:14:09,369
Come on.

482
01:14:09,536 --> 01:14:14,082
So then he killed him
with a fish-hook.

483
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:18,128
Did he use the same hook
to cut your hair off?

484
01:14:18,295 --> 01:14:22,966
No. He used a scissors. Asshole.

485
01:14:23,133 --> 01:14:26,845
I know I sound delusional.
But it's true.

486
01:14:27,012 --> 01:14:33,477
I heard the version with a mental
patient with a hook for a hand.

487
01:14:39,733 --> 01:14:43,695
We'll have to take the alley.

488
01:14:55,165 --> 01:14:59,586
Look.
You little shit-stick reject...

489
01:14:59,753 --> 01:15:04,132
There's been a murder. And
you'll fry in hell if you ignore it.

490
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:09,304
I'll contact Barry's parents,
and we'll put out a search for him.

491
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:14,184
He was probably
just playing a prank on you.

492
01:15:16,561 --> 01:15:23,235
Oh, Jesus. I'm just gonna see
if this fella needs help.

493
01:15:35,705 --> 01:15:38,083
It's him...

494
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:41,169
What's the trouble?

495
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:45,215
That's him! Behind you!

496
01:15:45,382 --> 01:15:47,759
Behind you!

497
01:16:35,056 --> 01:16:38,435
"Susie Willis killed.
Trapped in car."

498
01:16:38,602 --> 01:16:43,398
"Survived by her father Benjamin,
a local fisherman."

499
01:17:04,711 --> 01:17:07,297
Elsa...

500
01:17:07,464 --> 01:17:12,385
Elsa!
Open the door!

501
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:20,602
Elsa, open the door!
Jesus Christ, hurry!

502
01:17:24,397 --> 01:17:28,860
What are you doing? Elsa!

503
01:17:29,027 --> 01:17:33,782
Jesus Christ, hurry!
Open the door!

504
01:17:35,534 --> 01:17:38,578
I'm coming.

505
01:17:42,123 --> 01:17:46,294
- The Broad Street entrance is open.
- I'm being attacked.

506
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:49,005
You're what?

507
01:17:49,172 --> 01:17:55,053
Lock the other door.
I'll call the police. Do what I say!

508
01:18:46,104 --> 01:18:49,191
Elsa...

509
01:18:59,242 --> 01:19:02,245
Elsa?

510
01:19:04,289 --> 01:19:08,210
Elsa, where are you?

511
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

512
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

513
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:05,780
Ray.

514
01:23:09,826 --> 01:23:12,412
Ray!

515
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:22,047
- What are you doing here?
- It wasn't David Egan we killed.

516
01:23:22,214 --> 01:23:24,382
It was Susie's father. Ben Willis.

517
01:23:24,549 --> 01:23:29,971
- But they found David's body.
- I think Willis killed David.

518
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:36,937
- Then we killed Willis?
- But what if he didn't die?

519
01:23:38,605 --> 01:23:41,566
This is crazy.

520
01:23:41,733 --> 01:23:44,528
Come aboard.

521
01:23:44,694 --> 01:23:48,865
- We have to find Helen and Barry.
- We will.

522
01:24:02,295 --> 01:24:04,798
You...

523
01:24:05,757 --> 01:24:08,218
It's you.

524
01:24:08,385 --> 01:24:11,930
Billy Blue.
You went to Missy's.

525
01:24:12,097 --> 01:24:17,519
- You're the friend. The fisherman.
- I can explain. Julie, wait!

526
01:24:25,569 --> 01:24:28,738
- Wait.
- Stop it!

527
01:24:32,951 --> 01:24:37,080
- Please, help me.
- Easy, child.

528
01:24:37,247 --> 01:24:40,959
I need to call the police.

529
01:24:41,126 --> 01:24:44,921
On the boat! Hurry!

530
01:25:32,761 --> 01:25:36,181
Are you in some kind of trouble?

531
01:25:37,766 --> 01:25:41,478
Yes. I'm in a lot of trouble.

532
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:50,403
That's a shame.
Being it's the 4th of July and all.

533
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:56,076
Kids like you should be out
having fun. Drinking, partying, -

534
01:25:56,243 --> 01:26:01,581
- running people over, getting away
with murder, things like that.

535
01:26:04,167 --> 01:26:07,128
You...

536
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:12,676
- Ben Willis.
- Good. You did your homework, too.

537
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:54,820
Welcome aboard, Ray.

538
01:29:53,355 --> 01:29:57,484
Open the door, Julie.
You've got no place to hide.

539
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

540
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

541
01:32:10,075 --> 01:32:13,161
Come on. Julie.

542
01:32:25,423 --> 01:32:30,720
- Happy 4th of July, Julie.
- Please, it was an accident.

543
01:32:30,887 --> 01:32:35,851
When you leave a man for dead,
make sure he's really dead.

544
01:33:27,486 --> 01:33:32,407
We never killed anyone.
This whole year was for...

545
01:33:32,574 --> 01:33:37,787
The guilt was killing me.
I had to know who he was.

546
01:33:37,954 --> 01:33:40,665
That's why I went to see Missy.

547
01:33:40,832 --> 01:33:46,213
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but I wanted you back.

548
01:33:46,379 --> 01:33:50,675
I couldn't lose you again.

549
01:33:50,842 --> 01:33:56,765
I love you, Julie.
No one gets me the way you do.

550
01:33:57,808 --> 01:34:01,645
I understand your pain.

551
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:14,241
Do you have any idea
why this man would want you dead?

552
01:34:15,033 --> 01:34:17,369
None.

553
01:34:17,536 --> 01:34:20,747
Here it comes.

554
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:36,763
Well, don't worry.

555
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:42,227
The body will turn up.
They usually do.

556
01:34:50,402 --> 01:34:52,529
ONE YEAR LATER

557
01:34:52,696 --> 01:34:57,159
I made the dean's list.
Thank you very much.

558
01:34:57,325 --> 01:35:02,164
I miss you too, but I'll see you in
a couple of weeks. I love New York.

559
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:08,003
Of course I love you more.
You know that.

560
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:10,922
But I've got to take a shower.

561
01:35:11,089 --> 01:35:15,177
- Julie, you got some mail.
- Thanks. Deb.

562
01:35:18,054 --> 01:35:20,432
A towel.

563
01:35:20,599 --> 01:35:26,646
Don't start with me.
You can ravage me in two weeks.

564
01:35:26,813 --> 01:35:30,525
I love you too. Bye.

565
01:35:59,888 --> 01:36:02,390
POOL PARTY
THIS SATURDAY AT NOON

566
01:36:21,034 --> 01:36:27,833
I STILL KNOW

567
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
