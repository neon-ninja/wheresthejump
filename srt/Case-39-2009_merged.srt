1
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,558
I can see you.

2
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,316
...pull into this gas station,
the guy was like,

3
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,759
"Yo, man, you got problems."

4
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,474
Like, "What the hell do you think
I pulled in here for?"

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,639
So your car broke down
on the way to your blood check.

6
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,035
Yeah, smoke, everything.

7
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,991
I'm willing to give you the benefit
of the doubt, Javier, but a judge won't.

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,237
I missed a couple of meetings?
What's the problem?

9
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,108
I mean,
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

10
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,152
You're here because your son has
gotten into fights every day at school,

11
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,078
and the last one sent one of his
classmates to the hospital.

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,792
Juanita came here for help voluntarily

13
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,229
before the court stepped in
and made it mandatory,

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,590
that's what you're doing here.

15
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,836
He's on a dangerous road.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,589
Your history, all the violence,
all the anger,

17
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,632
that's his future
unless you break the cycle.

18
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,196
- I heard you, Mrs Lynch.
- You're trying to steal my boy!

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,515
No one is trying to steal your child.

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,517
- Then what are you trying...
- They found bruises

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,073
- and cigarette burns...
- I told you,

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,952
he was playing with some sparklers.

23
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,718
Mrs Lynch, I read the medical report.

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,637
I wanna talk to my own doctor.
I want a lawyer.

25
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,557
If you feel
that you need legal representation

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,591
- that's perfectly within your rights...
- I don't need your help, in no case.

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,469
- You've already interfered enough.
- You... Hello?

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,558
- How many active cases you got?
- Thirty-eight.

29
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,754
- Okay.
- Wayne, come on!

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,156
- Look, I'm buried here.
- I'm sorry, Em, we all are.

31
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,072
- You have three new voice messages.
- Hi.

32
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,639
Hey, it's Suze, missed you at yoga
the other day, give me a call.

33
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,111
Hey, Em, it's Jackie. Just checking in,
hope you're good.

34
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,590
Exhausted,
her career path questionable,

35
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,109
her faith in mankind shaken,

36
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,151
she resisted her tendency
toward introspection

37
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,795
and decides to go have a drink
with her charming friend Doug.

38
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,680
- I am so in your head.
- Be honest.

39
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,156
The whole psychology thing,
it's just about scoring chicks, isn't it?

40
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,840
Regrettably, yes. Two.

41
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,155
Well, what are we gonna
drink to tonight?

42
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,111
The never-ending fun
of a career in public service?

43
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,275
Yeah.

44
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,471
You know,
I sit there talking to these families,

45
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,238
the authority on everything.

46
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,717
And I have these moments
where I think I might be totally full of it.

47
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,030
Everybody's full of it.

48
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,955
In the end you're a number to call
for people who don't have anyone else.

49
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,957
There's no way that's bad.

50
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,835
Anyway, I've done some soul searching

51
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,158
and I just want to say

52
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,352
that if a full-on relationship
feels like too much right now,

53
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,517
I'd be willing to consider
a purely physical one.

54
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,757
- What?
- Nothing.

55
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,678
- What, you might actually enjoy yourself.
- Yeah, yeah, I probably would.

56
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,476
- It's just...
- I know, I know, the job,

57
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,832
you get home, no time for anybody else.
Whatever.

58
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,190
Listen, I'm giving you a month. Okay?
One month.

59
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,629
- And then?
- I don't know.

60
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,394
Probably give you another month,
but that is it.

61
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,239
Except for two more, then, it's over.

62
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,676
If it were anyone...

63
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,751
What are they doing to you?

64
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,029
- What?
- Emily Jenkins. Child Services?

65
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,639
We spoke on the phone?

66
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,672
- You said the 17th.
- It's the 17th.

67
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,712
- Is not.
- I'm sorry, but it is.

68
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,316
Monday the 17th.
The day of our appointment.

69
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,195
Hi.

70
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,475
Come down, I'd like to meet you.

71
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,109
My name's Emily. What's yours?

72
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,073
- Lily.
- That's a pretty name.

73
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,915
Is there somewhere we can talk?

74
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,397
So, when are you
expecting your husband back?

75
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,119
Because we've found that it's better
when the whole family participates.

76
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,916
Well, he's not here, so...

77
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,758
Do you have some way
of contacting him?

78
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,110
Not if I don't know where he is.

79
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,352
Is that...

80
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,633
Would you mind asking him
to join us, please?

81
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,514
- He doesn't have anything to say.
- Will you ask him, please?

82
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,429
Edward.

83
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,233
That lady is here from the state.
She wants to talk to you.

84
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,430
I don't have anything to say, tell her that!

85
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,154
I told her already, she wants to anyway.

86
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,198
It'll be okay.

87
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,633
Hi, I'm Emily.

88
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,949
Okay.

89
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,234
I'm here because we received a call

90
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,477
that Lilith
is showing serious signs of neglect.

91
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,552
Now at this point we can only assume
it's the result of family problems.

92
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,480
Eddie says
we don't have family problems.

93
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,239
Well, many families won't realise
that they're having problems

94
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,238
until it's too late.
And that's where we come in.

95
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,112
We help families communicate

96
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,277
and learn healthier ways
of resolving conflict.

97
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,675
Eddie says we don't need your help.

98
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,599
Mr Sullivan, is there a reason
why you won't speak to me directly?

99
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,635
Is there a reason why your husband
won't speak to me directly?

100
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,359
Eddie doesn't like speaking out of anger.

101
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,718
There's no laws
against being weird, Em.

102
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,831
I didn't say weird, I said scary.

103
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,349
That man sat there
staring at me the whole time,

104
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,994
and the mother is his emotional slave.

105
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,588
Wait, you didn't just fly to New York
and meet with my parents, did you?

106
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,233
Wayne?

107
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,033
All right. All right.
Are there any cuts, any bruises,

108
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,639
any signs she's being abused?

109
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,355
No, not physically.
But this girl's in trouble, I can feel it.

110
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,754
You wanna know what I can feel?

111
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,269
The lawsuit we're gonna get hit with
if we violate her parents' rights

112
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,436
without any evidence
they've done something wrong.

113
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,074
All right, Wayne.
You put these files on my desk

114
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,758
and you ask me to tell you
what's going on.

115
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,509
I've told you, I've done my job,
what you do with it is yours.

116
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,272
We're not perfect parents,
we know that,

117
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,038
but we figure if they know
how much you love them

118
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,072
a lot of the other stuff
takes care of itself.

119
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,035
She knows how we feel about her.

120
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,310
So, tell me, Mr Sullivan,

121
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,352
since you've suddenly acquired
the ability to speak,

122
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,879
doesn't it concern you a little

123
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,470
that Lily's grades have dropped
from A's to D's in three months?

124
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,830
Of course it does, she's our daughter.

125
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,555
So you have no idea why your daughter
falls asleep in class every day?

126
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,148
Why she can't sleep at home? No idea?

127
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,555
Bad dreams maybe?

128
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,518
Don't tell me you're buying
this whole "daddy's little girl" routine?

129
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,870
Look, they're not my favourite people
either, okay?

130
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,673
But we can't guarantee every kid
a happy childhood. I wish we could.

131
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,030
Let me talk to her.
She wants to talk. Alone.

132
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,550
- Em, we do not have a case.
- Just five minutes, okay?

133
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,399
Talk to them
about how much they love kids.

134
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,796
Hey, girls, slow down!

135
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,872
I used to wish I had a sister
when I was growing up.

136
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,433
To play with and to talk to

137
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,189
about all those things that you
just can't tell anybody else, you know?

138
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,153
Did you ever wish that?
That you had a sister?

139
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,673
Well, that was a silly thing to do,
wasn't it?

140
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,071
What's happening with you?

141
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,271
You know I can help. Let me help you.

142
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,991
What is it, sweetheart?

143
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,519
They hate me.

144
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,590
I'm sure they don't hate you.

145
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,554
They do. I hear them.

146
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,152
They go into the cellar and talk.

147
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,031
What do they talk about?

148
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,992
Sending me to hell.

149
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,996
You heard them say that?

150
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,629
You can tell him. He's on your side.
It's okay.

151
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,715
Lily, did you hear your parents say
they were gonna hurt you?

152
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,672
I was just thinking about you,
got a nice letter from Sandy Hutchinson.

153
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,715
Well, well, well.

154
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,308
It's sitting right in front of me,
which means our good friend Wayne

155
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,398
has decided it fails to meet the criteria
for child endangerment

156
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,080
and has told you in no uncertain terms
to leave it alone.

157
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,237
- Surprise, surprise.
- I'm sorry, Emily. I can't.

158
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,954
Please, Mike, I'm really desperate here.

159
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,754
Emily.

160
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,718
Now, you know how dear to my heart
the work you do is,

161
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,389
but the department doesn't pay me
to stake out potential child abusers.

162
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,476
Last time almost cost me my job.

163
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,991
This little girl heard her parents say
they're going to send her to hell.

164
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,432
Sickening as that is,

165
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,517
you're a part of the system that
deals with those situations, I'm not.

166
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,756
But sometimes the system doesn't work.

167
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,155
Well, maybe you should just let it.

168
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,999
Wow. Feel like
I'm talking to Wayne here.

169
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,349
All right. You don't want to get involved,
that's fine,

170
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,313
but don't bullshit me, Mike,
I'm running out of people I respect.

171
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,797
Okay. No bullshit. Bring me evidence
of a crime, I'm all over it. Till then...

172
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,717
Let's go, hurry up!

173
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,831
Lily! Lily!

174
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,071
Hi. I came to tell you
I hadn't forgotten about you.

175
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,997
I'm doing everything I can.

176
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,956
If I disappear will you come look for me?

177
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,597
- You're not going to disappear.
- If I do?

178
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,799
I have to go. They get mad at me
when I miss the bus.

179
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,519
Lily, wait. Wait.

180
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,430
Here. It's my home number.

181
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,116
If you get scared,
I want you to call me, okay?

182
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,073
I'm gonna get you out of there,
I promise.

183
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,029
Okay.

184
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,118
Hey, this is Doug, here it comes.

185
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,119
Hey, it's me,
thought you might be awake.

186
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,435
Just calling 'cause...

187
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,273
Well, I don't really know why I'm calling.

188
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,231
Call me if you get this, okay?

189
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,591
...proposal in Morton Township
has some residents...

190
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,837
Here we go golfers and shoppers...

191
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,273
Let's look at the crepe batter.
In order to make the crepe batter...

192
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,838
- Too late, I met someone else.
- Emily.

193
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,632
Lily? Are you okay?

194
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,237
- I'm scared.
- Why, honey? Why are you scared?

195
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,314
They're waiting to get me,
I can hear them.

196
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,069
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you sorry?

197
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,596
- I'm falling asleep.
- Okay, listen.

198
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,518
Go over and open the window.
Can you do that?

199
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,950
- I'm sorry.
- Lily? Lily?

200
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,276
- Yeah, Barron.
- Mike, it's Emily.

201
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,630
That girl that I told you about,
I think she's in a lot of trouble.

202
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,955
- Emily, you're going...
- No, I know what you said.

203
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,116
Mike, you're not listening! Help me!

204
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,634
- What are we doing here, Emily?
- Saving her life!

205
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,672
- They're asleep like we should be.
- They're not asleep.

206
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,553
- Did you hear that?
- I didn't hear anything.

207
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,954
Leave her alone!

208
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,189
No!

209
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,033
Let me out!

210
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,274
- Did you hear that?
- Police, open up!

211
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,434
Stop!

212
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,670
Break, break it down. Break it down!

213
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,589
Help me. Help me.

214
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,192
- Police!
- Lily!

215
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,395
Lily!

216
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,269
God! Oh, my God!

217
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,675
No! Help me!

218
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,873
Please, help me.

219
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,910
I got you, I got you, I got...

220
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,468
Okay. I got you.

221
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,830
What the hell's the matter
with you people?

222
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,279
I got you.

223
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,436
It's okay, honey. I got you.

224
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,351
It's okay. I got you.

225
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,512
The egregiousness of the crime makes

226
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,313
the competency question
all the more relevant.

227
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,115
I hereby order the defendants to
undergo psychiatric evaluation

228
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,800
to determine their fitness for trial.

229
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,518
Steal a pizza, San Quentin.

230
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,949
Try to kill your kid,
Freudian dream analysis.

231
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You're gonna hate me for saying this
but my money's on crazy.
What kind of people
put their kid in an oven?
Bad people. Remember that
when people were just bad?
Before everything had a diagnosis
and a justification?

232
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,153
It's human nature.

233
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,109
What's the most important thing

234
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,993
that we talked about
that you have to remember?

235
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,316
It's not my fault what happened.

236
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,716
That's right. You know what? It's not.

237
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,110
Good. I'll see you soon.

238
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,631
- Hey.
- Hi.

239
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,639
That is some seriously proactive
social work happening there.

240
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,392
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

241
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,556
- How's she doing?
- Typical reaction.

242
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,873
But she blames herself. We'll get there.

243
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,917
I'm gonna put her in a group setting,
see if I can get her to open up.

244
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,999
Group therapy for kids,
when am I going to get used to that?

245
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,797
- See you later. Okay.
- See you.

246
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,789
Hi.

247
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,110
Good news. They say you can
get out of here tomorrow.

248
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,438
Doug said I might have to go
to a state home.

249
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,915
Yeah, but it's only temporary,
till we find you a nice family.

250
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,997
Why can't I live with you?

251
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,194
Sweetheart, that would
never be allowed.

252
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,514
Why?

253
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,877
Well, it's complicated, I mean,
there's this whole process,

254
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,958
and I'm not even a foster parent. So...

255
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,438
It'll be fine.

256
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,517
- Hi, Barb.
- Hi, Em. Right this way, little lady.

257
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,879
I'll check in, in a couple of days, okay?

258
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,909
I don't want to stay here,
I want to live with you.

259
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,718
Please. I'll be good.

260
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,829
Lily, it's impossible, I told you.

261
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,837
Will you try?

262
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,630
Honey, listen, even if they said yes,
it would never work.

263
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,316
I work all day and
I'm hardly ever home and...

264
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,792
I'm sorry, I'm just not mom material.

265
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,594
How do you know if you've never tried?

266
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,517
So, it's just until we can find
the right family for her,

267
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,756
just until we can place her
in a really good home.

268
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,429
You know you'd have to give up
the case, conflict of interests and all.

269
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,879
Yeah.

270
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,512
Can I ask you a question?
Why are you doing this?

271
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,476
What Lily needs right now is
a safe, supportive environment

272
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,272
with someone she trusts.

273
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,517
The system can't provide that for her,
I think that I can.

274
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,313
Better than anyone, given my training.

275
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,193
We spend so much of our time
negotiating red tape,

276
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,313
I think if we look at this situation,
this one situation,

277
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,228
this one child,
it's clear what's best for her.

278
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,989
How long till Foster Services can
place her in a permanent home?

279
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,351
Three weeks, three months,
it's hard to predict.

280
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,632
No more visits.

281
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,036
- What?
- They said yes.

282
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,111
It's your new beginning.

283
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,594
Okay. It's what I like to think of as
a glass-half-full situation.

284
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,518
Bathroom. Kitchen. Fish.

285
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,871
And this is your room.

286
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,998
Be okay?

287
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,674
- You live alone?
- Just me.

288
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,228
Just us.

289
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,759
- What's this?
- It's chamomile.

290
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,359
Helps me sleep.

291
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,877
You know none of this
should ever have happened.

292
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,150
If I could make it go away, I would.

293
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,714
You did.

294
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,434
Here. Climb in.

295
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,039
Night night.

296
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,871
- Okay. All right.
- Here we go.

297
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,276
- Just got to grab some of her things.
- Okay.

298
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,278
- So, here's the key.
- You're not coming?

299
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,351
I got 15 other places I got to be.

300
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,836
So make sure you lock it on the way out.
Okay? Bye.

301
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

302
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,312
The kids at school are
saying all this stuff like saying

303
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,270
my mother is a puta

304
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,153
and I mean, I know
we can't go back home

305
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,513
but I miss it.

306
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,997
Sometimes when our parents
aren't getting along,

307
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,714
it's better if they spend some time apart.

308
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,479
That's what a restraining order does.

309
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,518
She's starting to come out of her shell.

310
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,756
It's good,
but you got to expect some hiccups.

311
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,110
And you can't undo
10 years of trauma in six weeks.

312
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,593
School? Too soon?

313
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,597
No, I don't have a problem
with her going back,

314
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,632
just as long as she's comfortable with it.

315
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,073
I went by the house.
I think her mom and dad were

316
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,236
barricading themselves
in their room at night.

317
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,713
How sick is that?

318
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,796
Well, fear and hatred are
part of the same pathology.

319
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,558
- See you. Bye, Diego.
- You too, Lily.

320
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,193
- But I forgot.
- Bye.

321
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,356
- Bye.
- You don't think they're crazy.

322
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,471
Well, I'm coming around.

323
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,193
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

324
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,916
- Wayne's looking for you.
- Okay.

325
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,038
- Wayne wants to see you.
- Yeah, I got it.

326
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,117
What's up with Diego?

327
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,358
Oh, hey.
Look, why don't we go talk in my office.

328
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,596
No, tell me what's going on.

329
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:56,070
Well, we don't... We don't know why yet
but he killed both his parents last night.

330
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,238
- Excuse me... Go ahead.
- Officer, let her through.

331
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,709
What happened?

332
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,991
Gets a tyre iron from the garage,
comes back inside,

333
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,513
locks all the doors and windows,
and kills them in their sleep.

334
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,834
"Slaughters" would be a better word.

335
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,398
Oh, my God!

336
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,672
A 10-year-old did this? There's no way.

337
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,071
I was there when they brought him in.
Took three guys to subdue him.

338
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,191
And the kid was climbing the walls.

339
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,392
Man's best friend, huh?

340
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,600
What happened?
Tell me what happened.

341
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,631
I killed my mom and dad.

342
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,436
Every family you sit down with,

343
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,711
every day of every week,
it's a family in crisis.

344
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,954
Those are your odds. Well,
that's your job, trying to beat them.

345
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,518
You're one person, Em.

346
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,271
You can't save the world.

347
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,430
I know somebody you did save.

348
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,909
Yeah.

349
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,433
- You okay?
- Yeah.

350
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,110
It's just work. Don't worry.

351
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,957
- I think you have a hard job.
- So do I.

352
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,117
People have kids and then they decide
they don't want to be parents.

353
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
And then the kids grow up
thinking it's their fault.
Is that what your parents did?

354
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,037
You said you were alone.

355
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,909
Yeah.

356
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,871
I never met my dad.

357
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,669
And my mom... My mom had problems.

358
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,112
- She must have scared you.
- Why do you say that?

359
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,554
You don't like to talk about it.

360
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,196
You're a clever little girl.

361
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,433
Sweetheart. Breakfast.

362
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,393
What you got?

363
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,713
Let me see.

364
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,636
You went through my things?

365
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,552
I'm sorry. I wanted to know about you.

366
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,631
Is that your mother?

367
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,078
What happened to her?

368
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,597
She died when I was about your age.

369
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,353
- How?
- An accident.

370
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,995
It was raining
and she was driving too fast.

371
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,152
We had an accident.

372
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,918
Are you mad at me?

373
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,992
No, I'm not mad at you.

374
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,831
But I need you
not to do that again, okay?

375
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,679
Go through my private things
without asking.

376
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,348
Okay? All right.

377
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,149
Omelette's getting cold. Better hurry.

378
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,434
You watch, six months,
their lawyer will hire an expert

379
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,030
to say they're rehabbed and they'll sue
for custody when they get out.

380
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,673
She's not going back there.

381
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,473
I'll take her out of the state
before I let them near her again.

382
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,477
Didn't hear you say that.

383
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,599
You guys okay?

384
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,832
We're great. She's sweet,
very intuitive about everything.

385
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,555
You wanted to talk about something?

386
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,076
We pulled the Ramirezes'
phone records.

387
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,430
There was a call that night
before the murder.

388
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,552
- From who?
- The call came from your house, Emily.

389
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,389
What?

390
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,559
I'm not accusing you of anything,
I just want to know what was said.

391
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,398
But that's impossible.

392
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,750
I mean, I might have called them
the week before or something, but I...

393
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,872
I'm talking to you as a friend,
you know that, right?

394
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,956
Mike, did you not hear me?

395
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,629
As a friend, I'm telling you
that I didn't call that family.

396
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,871
He's in my group.
Why, did something happen?

397
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,591
We're trying to figure out why.

398
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,553
Diego got a call from here,
last Thursday night.

399
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,636
I'm just wondering
if he might have said something.

400
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,228
- That wasn't me.
- You didn't call him?

401
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,470
Lily, it's difficult sometimes
to tell the truth,

402
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,750
but I know you will
because you're a good kid.

403
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,632
I am telling the truth.

404
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,790
My backup files are in the cabinet.
Diego's is in there.

405
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,916
Maybe you got curious and went
through some, dialled a number?

406
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,349
It wasn't me, I swear.

407
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,709
The call came at 2:00 a.m.
You ever up that late?

408
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,513
- I didn't call him.
- You ever up that late?

409
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,552
Mike, she said no.
Maybe somebody made a mistake.

410
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,353
Yeah, maybe so.

411
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,799
Why would Diego do this?
He loved his mom and dad.

412
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,796
You never want to think anyone you
know is capable of that kind of thing.

413
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,435
In your mind, it's always some
nameless, faceless creature.

414
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,674
Sometimes, the city seems full of them.

415
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,193
But they're just people,
like you and me.

416
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,274
She's lying.

417
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,232
Do you believe me?

418
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,959
I believe you.

419
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,709
I need to ask you something
about the night it happened.

420
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,718
Did you get a call? Really late?

421
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,439
You didn't.

422
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,191
Diego, I know that you did.

423
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,276
The call came from my house.

424
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,232
What's the matter?

425
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,509
What's scaring you? Diego.

426
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,391
It's okay, it's all right. Deep breaths,
deep breaths, you'll be all right.

427
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,988
Can we get some help in here, please?

428
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,556
Who called you? Was it Lily?

429
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,190
Did she say something to you?
Something that scared you?

430
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,838
- Él dijo.
- "Él dijo"?

431
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,231
What do you mean, "He said"?

432
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,232
- Era un hombre.
- It was a man?

433
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

434
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,636
Do you

435
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,195
like working here?

436
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,755
Well, photocopying isn't much fun.

437
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,032
- What?
- Knock, knock. Sorry I'm late, guys.

438
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,071
You ready to go, kiddo?

439
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,397
- So, how's school?
- Fine.

440
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,631
Any of your classmates
giving you a hard time?

441
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,194
No, they've been nice.

442
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,398
You sleeping okay?

443
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,789
That's not really what
you want to talk about, is it, Doug?

444
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,148
You got me.

445
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,796
Question 16, am I afraid of the dark?
You answered no.

446
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,357
Question 23, am I afraid of being alone?
You answered no.

447
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,230
26, am I afraid of my parents? No.

448
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,272
You answered no
to everything in that section.

449
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,753
I think that some of those
should have been yeses.

450
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,359
Everybody is scared of something.

451
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,391
Working through our fears,
conquering them,

452
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,192
is how we get better.

453
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,551
So, I want you to tell me,
what scares you?

454
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,029
I'll tell you what scares me
if you tell me what scares you.

455
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,353
Fair enough.

456
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,151
When I was a kid, I was climbing a tree,

457
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,919
and I accidentally put my hand
through a giant hornets' nest.

458
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,952
And they didn't like it.
I was stung over a hundred times.

459
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,514
They had to rush me to the hospital.

460
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,715
Been afraid of hornets ever since.

461
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,075
I don't climb many trees either.

462
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,519
Everybody has fears.
Now, what scares you?

463
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,431
- Me.
- You scare yourself?

464
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,919
- Sometimes.
- Why? What about yourself scares you?

465
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,711
I have bad thoughts.

466
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,990
- About what?
- People.

467
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,071
- People in general or certain people?
- Certain people.

468
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,872
- Like who?
- You.

469
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,035
You have bad thoughts about me?

470
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,470
- Why?
- I just do.

471
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,837
Did I do something or say something
that upset you?

472
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,718
It's just the way you are.

473
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,194
How am I?

474
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,389
- Facile.
- Facile?

475
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,319
Do you even know what that means?

476
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,479
Easily comprehended.
Often lacking sincerity or depth.

477
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,638
You're smug, too.

478
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,798
Want me to tell you what that means?

479
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,198
- If I seemed smug or facile I want to...
- Don't apologise.

480
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,435
Why not?

481
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,153
You're a grown-up. It's embarrassing.

482
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,148
Number 12,
I worry about what's going to happen.

483
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,873
- Yes or no?
- You want me to answer that?

484
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,268
- Yes or no?
- No.

485
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,518
That should be a yes.

486
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,150
Should we talk about school now?

487
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,035
My grades are getting a lot better.

488
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,878
I talked to a lot of kids, I don't think
I've ever felt like that before.

489
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,228
Like what?

490
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,074
Threatened.

491
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,436
I know a specialist,
I'm gonna call him in the morning.

492
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,833
Are you mad at me?

493
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,599
No. No, I'm just tired.

494
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,557
- Want me to brush your hair?
- No, thanks.

495
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,553
- Are you sure?
- Some other time.

496
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,512
It will make you feel better.
I'll get the brush.

497
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,312
I said no, thank you.

498
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,595
Doug said something, didn't he?

499
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,396
Doug? No.
Doug says you're doing great.

500
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,000
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing.

501
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,955
Hello.

502
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,158
Try again, sorry.

503
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,554
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God,

504
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,672
of his great mercy,
to take unto himself the soul

505
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,597
of our dear brother, here departed,

506
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,518
we, therefore,
commit his body to the ground.

507
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,671
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
and dust to dust,

508
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,198
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life,

509
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,073
through our Lord, Jesus Christ, amen.

510
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,590
You think it's my fault, don't you?

511
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,395
It's no one's fault. It was an accident.

512
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,079
There was no sign of forced entry,

513
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,156
he was alone
and the doors were locked.

514
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,716
I know he didn't kill himself.
He was scared.

515
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,230
He came out of that room with her, Mike,
and he was scared.

516
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,759
He said she threatened him.

517
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,916
Emily, you're in shock,
let's not get carried away.

518
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,476
Diego, he said it was a man
on the phone.

519
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,033
There was no one else in the house.

520
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,390
Do you think I don't know
how crazy this sounds?

521
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,034
Kid in that state of mind
is not the most reliable witness.

522
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,311
But why was he in that state of mind?
Why was Doug?

523
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,874
Pull my phone records.
See if she called him.

524
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,514
I already did, Emily. There was no call.

525
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,158
So, you're saying that
you've seen this before,

526
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,350
someone just dying like that?

527
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,435
Truly? I'm shocked every day by
the violence people do to themselves.

528
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:54,150
Her mom and dad had deadbolts
on their bedroom door, big ones.

529
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,393
Something came through that door,
and whatever it was,

530
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,671
they didn't want it
ever coming through there again.

531
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,474
- Hey guys, come on, are you ready?
- Yeah.

532
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,317
- Let's get to it?
- Yeah.

533
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,075
Take me through the conversation,
Margaret, about the oven.

534
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,599
Eddie said, "We're gonna burn her,"
and I said, "Okay."

535
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,358
So it was Edward's idea?

536
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,869
Just the oven part,
we both wanted her dead.

537
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,993
Why did you say that it was God's will
that you should kill your daughter?

538
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,238
- Why is that funny, Margaret?
- 'Cause she's not my daughter.

539
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,716
You think your daughter is the devil?
Evil incarnate?

540
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,958
I don't care what you call it.

541
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,594
But you have stated
that she kills people?

542
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,235
Not by her own hand, they just die.

543
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,518
I had two brothers,

544
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,352
Eddie had three sisters.

545
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:19,233
Soon as she was born,
they just started dying.

546
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,672
Me and Eddie, I guess,

547
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,316
she couldn't get rid of us
until she found somebody else.

548
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,995
The nurse on duty heard screaming,

549
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,590
found Mrs Sullivan on the floor
clawing at her own skin,

550
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,234
absolutely convinced she was on fire.

551
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,432
In no condition for visitors
as you can see.

552
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,718
If you'd like,
I can let you see Mr Sullivan.

553
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,635
Okay.

554
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:36,269
I know I'm probably the last person
you want to see right now,

555
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,996
but you're the only one that I can talk to.

556
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,348
Who died?

557
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,314
- A friend.
- You're scared.

558
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,198
You ought to be.

559
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,311
Is she...

560
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,158
- What is she?
- I can tell you what she's not.

561
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,237
She's not a daughter of mine. She's not
a 10-year-old having trouble in school.

562
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,828
And she's not some innocent victim
whose door you busted down

563
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,598
and life you saved.

564
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,474
She's not going anywhere soon, lady.

565
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,996
Not till she's good and done with you.

566
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,918
- Done with me how?
- However she wants.

567
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,874
You think it's an accident
her ending up with you?

568
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,150
She saw you coming a mile away.

569
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,349
Why me? I don't have anything.

570
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:32,116
You have that you're good. Kindness.
Decency. That's what she feeds on.

571
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,395
Bleeds you dry, moves on to the next.
We were a big family,

572
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,279
she went through us
like a wrecking ball.

573
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,430
It's like she sees everything.

574
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,232
And what she doesn't see, she senses.

575
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:53,388
Like when you call a friend
and they pick it up before it rings?

576
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,676
They say when you're born
you're given your eternal soul.

577
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,871
The part of you that lives on, lives again.

578
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:06,239
Whatever evil she is,
didn't come from us.

579
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,513
It was already there.

580
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,950
From the moment she came into being,
she brought something with her.

581
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,275
Something older, destructive.

582
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,718
Soul of a demon.

583
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,351
What does she want?

584
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,433
To know what your idea of hell is

585
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,355
and make you live there.

586
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

587
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,438
- Hi.
- Hi.

588
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,549
You weren't there so I took the bus.

589
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,559
Sorry, work, I lost track of time.

590
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,948
It's okay, I know how busy you are.

591
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:36,109
Doesn't matter anyway, the bus
stops right at the end of the street.

592
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,233
So I can always get home,
whether you're there or not.

593
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,109
Lucky.

594
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,478
Where's the phone?

595
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,471
It wasn't working, so...

596
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,470
Wow. That one, too.

597
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,194
We had gym today.
I'm gonna have a shower.

598
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,398
- Are they being nice to her?
- Who?

599
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,748
My mother.

600
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,358
How would I know that?

601
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,713
I thought you said
you were going to see her.

602
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,112
I never said that.

603
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,712
I must have dreamt it.

604
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,709
- Nancy.
- Emily.

605
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:58,869
I'm so sorry about Doug.
I know you two were close.

606
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,031
Do you have a minute?

607
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:06,196
I was just wondering if you've had any
luck finding a place for Lilith?

608
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,831
Still looking. You know,
more kids than homes right now.

609
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,996
So, how long you think
we're talking here? Like...

610
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:15,157
Honestly, she's not my first priority.

611
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,794
She's in a safe environment with
someone who understands her needs.

612
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,148
Nancy,

613
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,793
if there's anything that
you could do to expedite

614
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,998
- the process...
- Are you serious?

615
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,029
Emily, you petitioned for custody,
you got it.

616
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,628
She's your responsibility. Make it work.

617
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:39,356
How? How do I make it work
if it's not working?

618
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:43,519
With the same coping skills you teach
these moms and dads every week!

619
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:46,598
Walk the talk, Emily! Walk the talk!

620
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,630
See you next time. Good work.

621
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,789
Why is she hurting...

622
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:33,232
Hey, wait a minute. Who do you think
you are, barging in there like that?

623
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,716
It's okay, Diane,
Emily's been under a lot of stress lately,

624
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,913
but she's really nice to me and
I hope I can stay with her a long time.

625
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,791
Don't ever do that again.

626
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,352
See you next week, Diane.

627
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,516
Don't worry,
it was all a misunderstanding.

628
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:59,633
- You're not going back there.
- Why, Emily?

629
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:07,675
Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

630
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:12,749
Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

631
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,271
Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

632
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,949
Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

633
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,593
Why, Emily?

634
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,878
Can I go back to group next week?

635
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,915
You're never going back there!

636
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,233
Are you sure?

637
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,593
No. No.

638
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,600
- I know.
- You were terrific back there.

639
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,917
Really enjoyed the service, Father.
Thanks.

640
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,794
- Mike.
- Emily.

641
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:41,073
They are not crazy, Mike. Her parents.

642
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,599
They're right about her.

643
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,837
You want to wind up where they are?
Keep talking like this.

644
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,269
Emily, you're grieving for Doug

645
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,119
and you're still confused
about what Diego did.

646
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,800
- Aren't you?
- Diego grew up in a bad home,

647
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,559
he saw violence, he repeated it,
that's the cycle.

648
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,990
- You know that better than anyone.
- Why did she lie about calling him?

649
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,873
Because she's a liar, but that
doesn't mean she made him do it.

650
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,558
Let me tell you what Lily is.

651
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,956
She's a damaged child,
she's a deceitful child,

652
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,593
she's a manipulative child.

653
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,030
But a damaged, deceitful,
manipulative child is not a demon.

654
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,878
You think I'm crazy.

655
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,514
You believe in there.
But out here it's all just bullshit?

656
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,438
Mike, you know I'm not crazy.

657
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,677
Don't run away from this
just because it scares you.

658
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,155
I'll tell you what is scaring me
is not recognising my friend.

659
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,077
- Get some help. Seriously.
- Mike...

660
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,156
I don't want to report you.

661
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,399
Good night.

662
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,636
Mrs Lynch, I told you that...

663
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,274
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Do you think I'm just making this up?

664
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,358
- That's not what you said. I'm not stupid.
- Yeah, no.

665
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,799
You never said anything
about unsupervised visits.

666
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:30,875
No, that is not what I said.

667
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,718
You said if my husband got help,
then my son could come home.

668
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,876
- I did not. No.
- Nothing between the lines there.

669
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:35,989
You never said that...

670
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,553
Who do you think you are
telling me how to raise my son?

671
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,635
- Mrs Lynch...
- You know nothing about me.

672
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,637
You know nothing about my son.
You know nothing about my family.

673
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:41,715
Will you please let me respond?

674
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,671
How I raise my child is
none of your business.

675
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,755
Would you let... Would you...

676
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,393
How my son and his father relate
is none of your business.

677
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:49,796
Shut the fuck up,
you miserable, miserable woman

678
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,388
before I come and beat your ass
like you beat your son!

679
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,192
I have your address!

680
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,517
Think about that before you call
and swear at me!

681
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,955
Okay, so, you're certainly in no state
of mind to be here right now.

682
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,198
Come on, it's late,
you look like shit, go home.

683
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,597
I don't want to go home.

684
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:14,949
Hello?

685
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,999
It's for you.

686
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,789
Emily Jenkins.

687
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,514
You shouldn't leave me
home alone, Emily.

688
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,469
Wayne?

689
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

690
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,990
There you are. I made supper.

691
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,835
Don't ignore me.
My mother used to ignore me.

692
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,796
Emily? Can I come in?

693
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,639
I'm scared.

694
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:30,512
Emily? Please? I know you're in there.

695
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,359
Please, Emily?

696
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:04,237
Let me in, let me in.

697
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,435
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in,

698
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,551
let me in, let me in, let me in.

699
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,318
Leave me alone.

700
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,432
Please, help me.

701
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:34,274
Please! No, please open the door?

702
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,270
Open the door, she's coming!

703
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,234
- Drive.
- There's nobody out there.

704
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:48,835
- Drive!
- There is nobody out there. Look.

705
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,237
There's nobody out there.

706
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,239
It's okay.

707
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,476
Leaving the child unattended
is a jailable offence.

708
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,515
You have to do what I say.

709
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
If I say I want to go to group,
you have to do it.
If I say I want a new dress,
you have to do it.

710
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,639
If I say I want ice cream every day,
after school,

711
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,390
you have to do it, okay?

712
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,715
Don't be sad.
This is your new beginning.

713
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,669
Emily.

714
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:00,632
I tried to call you.
Good news, we found a home for Lily.

715
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,873
Family in Cloverfield.
Really good people.

716
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
They're picking her up Friday,
after school.
What's the matter? They're perfect.

717
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,559
- If they take her...
- The whole thing starts all over again.

718
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,910
You can't let her go,
you can't let her stay.

719
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,429
Leaves you one option.

720
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,035
- I can't.
- You have to.

721
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,878
- You don't understand.
- Don't tell me I don't understand.

722
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,911
You've had her, what, two months?
I had her 10 years.

723
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,837
We had her 10 years.

724
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,520
- Think of it as a test of faith.
- I don't wanna have any faith.

725
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,074
How about anger?
You got some of that?

726
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:50,273
- How? How do I...
- Kill her?

727
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,799
In her asleep.

728
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,516
That's the only time you got
the upper hand, is when she's sleeping,

729
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,153
but she almost never does.

730
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,396
We checked on her room,
every night for three months.

731
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:04,195
First night she slept was the night
that you busted in our front door.

732
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:08,751
And I'll tell you what I'd do different,
count yourself dead at the outset.

733
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,792
Accept that going in,
use it to your advantage.

734
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,999
If you're not afraid, she can't hurt you.

735
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,789
No money, no way to contact her.

736
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,997
Must have went 80 on the way back,
straight through,

737
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,997
didn't stop for nothing.

738
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,270
When we got home,
she was waiting for us on the doorstep.

739
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:56,594
Where is she now?
Some family, somewhere?

740
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,351
Eddie said, "We're gonna burn her,"
and I said, "Okay."

741
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:05,557
They did what I said for a while,
but then they stopped

742
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,870
and started with the secrets.

743
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:12,200
But they weren't really secrets, I guess,

744
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,633
because I always knew
what they were thinking.

745
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,629
- Don't leave me.
- It's okay, Maggie. I'll check on you later.

746
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,792
I'm glad you're getting
the help you need, Daddy.

747
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:58,915
Get somebody down here now.

748
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,314
- Somebody call it in.
- Base, this is Sanchez.

749
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,512
We're gonna need medical personnel
right away to the cafeteria...

750
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,756
- Edward Sullivan...
- I know.

751
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,870
Something I want you to hear.

752
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,991
This came in this morning,
right about 2:00 a.m.

753
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,792
You might wanna sit.

754
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:34,196
...decide what to do with you
and your family, Michael.

755
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:40,473
Every time I think about it,
a voice in my head says, "Kill them."

756
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,839
Who is this?

757
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,318
Just a little girl.

758
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:50,037
- Up past her bedtime.
- Lilith?

759
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:59,028
You were right. She did call Doug.
She used your cell phone.

760
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,990
Took me a couple of extra days
to check your cell phone records,

761
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,395
but that's what she's been using.

762
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,430
- She's tearing me apart.
- You're not crazy, Emily. This is real.

763
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,710
Edward said I have to kill her.

764
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,479
I'll help you.

765
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,996
Keep her at the house.

766
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,395
Physically you're fine. How's the stress?

767
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,511
I'm not sleeping.

768
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:36,200
I was hoping you could
give me something.

769
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,195
Take one of these, you'll sleep.

770
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,155
Lily?

771
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,155
What?

772
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,713
Oh, my God.

773
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,319
Who is this?

774
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,120
Emily, it's Wayne,

775
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,515
I just got a call, Mike's dead.

776
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,831
- No, he's...
- Listen, Em.

777
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,030
They think he shot himself.

778
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:24,189
- Emily? Em?
- No...

779
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:30,910
Emily? Emily, are you okay?

780
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:49,628
Get out of my house!

781
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,517
Get out of my house!

782
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:11,032
Don't yell at me!

783
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:41,599
Emily, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

784
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,712
Can I come in so we can talk
and work it out?

785
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:50,959
Emily?

786
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,918
Stay away from me!

787
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:58,591
Don't be mad. I said I was sorry.
I'll brush your hair for you.

788
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,278
Stay away from me!

789
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:23,435
No! No. No.

790
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:52,674
Emily. Emily.

791
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,754
We need to learn healthier ways
of resolving conflict, Emily.

792
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:05,156
Most families
don't even know they have a problem

793
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,118
until it's too late.

794
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:27,030
What are you doing,
you silly pumpkinhead?

795
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,877
You don't want me to come under there
and get you, do you?

796
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,639
- No.
- I'm going to count to three.

797
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:38,874
- One, two...
- No.

798
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:43,030
Two and a half, two and three quarters,

799
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:47,877
three. Here I come.

800
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:53,034
- No! What do you want?
- What you wanted from your mother.

801
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:58,075
I want you to love me.

802
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,115
Okay. I will.

803
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,312
Come tuck me in.

804
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,318
Oh, my God.

805
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,553
Emily.

806
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,559
Chamomile.

807
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:16,195
Maybe you should have it,
you look stressed.

808
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,472
I'll have one later.

809
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:28,036
I'm really sorry
that I let things get like this.

810
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:31,232
- We'll do better from now on.
- We have to.

811
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,550
Someone could get hurt.

812
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,791
What should we do tomorrow?

813
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:44,319
- Surprise me.
- I'm not so good at surprises.

814
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,876
You're getting better.

815
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,678
Everybody get out okay?

816
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,439
Ma'am, anyone else inside? Yes or no?

817
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,993
That was mean.

818
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:35,515
You follow us downtown,
we'll find someplace for you to stay.

819
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:38,271
Miss? You okay?

820
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,313
I'm fine.

821
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:54,038
Maybe we can find a hotel
with a swimming pool.

822
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:08,719
- Where are we going?
- You said I should surprise you.

823
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:16,397
She hated herself.

824
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,837
And she hated you.

825
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:23,669
They said it was an accident,
but you knew it wasn't.

826
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,028
Your mother.

827
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:27,833
That's why you never had
any kids of your own.

828
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,315
That's what you're afraid of, isn't it?

829
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:33,352
The part of you that's her.

830
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,272
What are you?

831
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:46,834
- Slow down!
- What the hell are you?

832
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,873
You're upset, you shouldn't be driving.

833
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,029
Mom.

834
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,235
Mom, slow down, you're scaring me.

835
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,195
Mom! Slow down, please!

836
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:32,959
Look out!

837
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:36,958
- It's not real.
- Yes, it is!

838
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:42,074
It's not real!

839
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,673
Are you scared?

840
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,508
I'm not.

841
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,033
I'm not afraid.

842
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,239
