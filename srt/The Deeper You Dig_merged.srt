00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:08,781
- Hey beautiful.
- Hi.

3
00:02:09,347 --> 00:02:10,546
I just gotta run
to the store real fast,

4
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,015
case we get snowed in.

5
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:13,384
'Kay.

6
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,787
How was school?

7
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:17,954
Fine.

8
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:20,826
Miss Nichols says I can't
wear dark lipstick anymore.

9
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,762
You want me to go in
and kick her ass?

10
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,901
- Are we going hunting this weekend?
- Mm-hmm.

11
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:31,802
Remember,

12
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:33,906
I'm gonna get my seventh
in under twenty.

13
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:36,074
I don't doubt it.

14
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:44,881
Wanna go sledding tonight?

15
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:46,448
Sure.

16
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,587
Oh, wait, I got a session
with Mrs. Minskey tonight.

17
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,789
She still tryin' to talk
to her dead husband?

18
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,058
Yeah, but I'm gonna shake her
out of a little more money

19
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,560
before she gets
to talk to him.

20
00:02:57,562 --> 00:02:59,996
That's cunty.
I like it.

21
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:01,031
Thank you.

22
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,699
That's called business.

23
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:03,936
Noted.

<i>Sub-zero temperature gonna be

27
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:21,885
What's goin' on, man?
That's it?

28
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:23,485
<i>Stay safe out there folks,</i>

29
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:24,788
<i>this storm is one

30
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,791
Twelve fifty.

31
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:27,991
Stockin' up for the storm?

32
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:28,992
<i>Stay off the road,</i>

33
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:30,829
<i>and let the road cleaners

34
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:33,065
Drive safe out there.

35
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:35,031
Mom, I'm gonna get
a cinnamon

36
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,733
coffee cake cappuccino.

37
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:38,001
You want one?

38
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:39,903
No, and you can't
have one either.

39
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:40,737
Why?

40
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,074
Because you'll be
up all night.

41
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:44,074
Good, I'm gonna be
sledding all night.

42
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:46,109
No, I can't be at the bottom
of the road to watch you.

43
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:48,144
I got that session
with Mrs. Minskey.

44
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,915
And I know
you have homework.

45
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:52,885
Fuck homework.

46
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:17,042
- Ah!
- Ah!

47
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:45,971
So, how we doin'
over here?

48
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:49,908
Lemme get another shot
and a beer.

49
00:05:06,158 --> 00:05:08,091
What are we asking
of the cards tonight,

50
00:05:08,093 --> 00:05:09,993
Mrs. Minskey?

51
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:13,196
I'd like to know if my
sciatica will ever go away.

52
00:05:13,198 --> 00:05:14,632
It hurts!

53
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:18,068
Also,

54
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,206
I'd like to know if my son
is ever going to visit me.

55
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,641
Maybe a phone call.

56
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:28,644
But most of all,

57
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:32,117
I'd like to speak
to my beloved husband.

58
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,616
My darling Ivan.

59
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:36,086
Can we do that, please?

60
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:41,124
Is that a good one
or a bad one?

61
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:46,665
Whispers from the shadows.

62
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,965
Pass through the filament

63
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:51,602
and pierce this
earthly realm.

64
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:57,009
Two hearts, once one,
still yearn to shine.

65
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:01,213
Bound by love,
locked in time.

66
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:04,748
Listen now
and hear our calls.

67
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,251
Show a sign
within these walls.

68
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:09,721
Ivan.

69
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,090
Ivan Minskey?

70
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,826
Are you there, Ivan?

71
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:17,996
Can you hear us?

72
00:06:19,231 --> 00:06:21,066
Ivan, honey, I'm here.

73
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:23,567
I'm here.

74
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:27,571
Please, please
won't you talk to us?

75
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:32,175
The filament is thick.

76
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:34,880
The veil won't part.

77
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,690
Oh, Valley of Death.

78
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:50,695
We stand on the
Mountain of Hope.

79
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:52,862
We call out your name,

80
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:56,234
but all we hear
is an echo.

81
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,936
<i>Mom.</i>

82
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:01,706

83
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:04,040
<i>I love you.</i>

84
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,977
A whisper?

85
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:10,849
No.

86
00:07:12,184 --> 00:07:13,952
No.

87
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:17,956
Nothing.

88
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:19,623
Oh well.

89
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:22,194

Uh, seven o'clock.

105
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,491
I came home from work
about fifteen minutes ago,

106
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:03,760
and she wasn't here.

107
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:05,731
She's not here.

108
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,535
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure
that she's not here.

109
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:16,138
Her coat is gone
and her sled is gone,

110
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,210
but if she went sledding,
she didn't come back.

111
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:23,246
No,
no she couldn't be out there,

112
00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:26,050
I just drove up my road,
I would've seen her.

Hey, uh, we're lookin'

Fourteen year old girl?

She's been missing
since last night.

141
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,491
- Have you happened to see her at all?
- No. No.

142
00:19:02,493 --> 00:19:04,928
Do you know your uh,
neighbors down the road?

143
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,364
I don't.

Uh, went to Main Street

153
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:26,716
Couple drinks.

154
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:28,484
- What time you stay 'til?
- Late.

155
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:29,351
How late?

156
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:30,720
I... I wasn't
keeping track of time,

157
00:19:30,722 --> 00:19:32,956
but probably I left
around ten?

158
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,658
That's not that late.

159
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,893

No.

00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:40,565
Not even a deer?

162
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:44,402
Maybe, I don't know.
I...

163
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:47,806
You okay?
Look a little nervous.

- No.

Hey man,
before you leave,

197
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,825
you wanna spread the word?

198
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:30,662
She's a good kid.

199
00:27:39,577 --> 00:27:41,012
Hello?

200
00:27:43,248 --> 00:27:44,280
<i>Hello?</i>

201
00:27:44,282 --> 00:27:45,583
Yeah, hold on.

202
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:48,184
Oh hey, um,
could uh...

203
00:27:48,186 --> 00:27:50,119
could I just talk to you
for a second?

204
00:27:50,121 --> 00:27:53,089
I'm Ivy Allen, I...
I live down the road um,

205
00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:55,327
I'm lookin' for
my daughter, Echo?

206
00:27:56,428 --> 00:27:58,163
You know her?

207
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,268
We live right down the road.

208
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,339
She rides her bike here.
Are you sure?

209
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:12,444
Yeah, I don't know her,
I've never seen her.

210
00:28:16,014 --> 00:28:17,349
Did the cops come?

211
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:19,482
Yeah.

212
00:28:19,484 --> 00:28:21,353
She didn't run away.

213
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:29,861
So you're tryin' to
resurrect this dump?

214
00:28:30,362 --> 00:28:31,060
Yeah.

215
00:28:31,062 --> 00:28:33,198
I'm gonna fix it
and flip it.

216
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:36,132
It's been abandoned
for years.

217
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:38,103
We used to come here
to party.

218
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,006
You must've cleaned out
a lot of glass and beer cans.

219
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:46,378
What's your name?

220
00:28:47,112 --> 00:28:48,613
Kurt.

221
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:52,949
You got a cat?

222
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:57,122
No this house just...
makes noise.

223
00:28:58,123 --> 00:28:59,658
Echo!

224
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:09,733
I saw you on the road
the other day,

225
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:11,269
you didn't stop.

226
00:29:12,504 --> 00:29:14,103
Huh,
I don't remember that.

227
00:29:14,105 --> 00:29:16,007
Yeah,
then I saw you in the town.

228
00:29:17,142 --> 00:29:19,175
I doubt that was me.

229
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:21,613
It was you.
It's okay.

230
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:25,684
Well, I live...

231
00:29:28,386 --> 00:29:30,654
We live in the first house
this side of the cemetery,

232
00:29:30,656 --> 00:29:32,622
up the steep drive?

233
00:29:32,624 --> 00:29:34,192

00:44:32,658 --> 00:44:33,925
Hungry?

294
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:35,460
Drink?

295
00:44:36,027 --> 00:44:38,027
- Water?
- No.

296
00:44:38,029 --> 00:44:39,364
Sit.

297
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:51,174
Nice place.

298
00:44:51,176 --> 00:44:52,642
Thanks to you.

299
00:44:52,644 --> 00:44:54,479
You taught me
everything I know.

300
00:44:56,247 --> 00:44:57,949
I lost my sight.

301
00:44:58,183 --> 00:45:00,018
You lost your faith.

302
00:45:02,354 --> 00:45:03,922
I read your book.

303
00:45:05,658 --> 00:45:07,892
Times bestseller list, huh?

304
00:45:09,594 --> 00:45:11,329
How much of it was true?

305
00:45:12,364 --> 00:45:13,865
All of it.

306
00:45:16,301 --> 00:45:18,201
In the book it says

307
00:45:18,203 --> 00:45:21,005
that you were given the key
to the Seven Circles.

308
00:45:21,707 --> 00:45:23,441
Is that true?

309
00:45:26,144 --> 00:45:28,411
Del, on the night
that Echo disappeared,

310
00:45:28,413 --> 00:45:30,646
she reached out to me
from the darkness.

311
00:45:30,648 --> 00:45:32,917
That's a mother's intuition.

312
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:34,452
Maybe.

313
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,320
But then she
revealed to me a sign

314
00:45:37,322 --> 00:45:39,391
of the Seven Circles.

315
00:45:41,092 --> 00:45:44,229
And you know that has
nothing to do with intuition.

316
00:45:47,499 --> 00:45:49,167
Please.

317
00:45:56,709 --> 00:46:00,211
The Seven Circles
are unforgiving.

318
00:46:02,715 --> 00:46:05,150
They are locked in grief.

319
00:46:06,484 --> 00:46:09,521
They will warp
everything within them.

320
00:46:11,189 --> 00:46:15,059
Every gift is its own
twisted curse.

321
00:46:17,629 --> 00:46:19,295
And for you,

322
00:46:19,297 --> 00:46:21,564
who's turned her back
on her calling,

323
00:46:21,566 --> 00:46:24,269
you will pay dearly.

324
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,971
I'll pay.

325
00:46:42,487 --> 00:46:44,989
Whoever opens the box

326
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,191
enters the Seven Circles.

327
00:46:48,193 --> 00:46:51,162
But it is not you
who goes through them.

328
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:54,466
It is they
that go through you.

329
00:47:02,407 --> 00:47:04,708
Once the door's opened,

330
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,045
it cannot be shut.

331
00:47:24,629 --> 00:47:26,331
What happens now?

332
00:49:13,806 --> 00:49:14,805
Listen,

333
00:49:14,807 --> 00:49:16,907
we just need to ask you
a couple more questions,

334
00:49:16,909 --> 00:49:18,677
we're still at square one.

335
00:49:20,411 --> 00:49:22,345
Ivy,
did Echo ever talk about

336
00:49:22,347 --> 00:49:24,215
being bullied at school?

337
00:49:24,582 --> 00:49:26,217
No.

338
00:49:29,387 --> 00:49:30,620
You don't have any
reason to believe

339
00:49:30,622 --> 00:49:33,124
that she would have run away,
do you?

340
00:49:37,495 --> 00:49:39,464
Echo did not run away.

341
00:49:40,298 --> 00:49:42,333
Something terrible
happened to her.

342
00:49:42,868 --> 00:49:45,802
I know, because
she reached out to me

343
00:49:45,804 --> 00:49:47,572
from another realm.

344
00:49:49,675 --> 00:49:52,778
I need you
to help me find out

345
00:49:53,578 --> 00:49:55,211
what happened to her.

346
00:49:55,213 --> 00:49:57,582
But you can't help me
find her.

347
00:49:58,483 --> 00:50:00,184
Only I can do that.

348
00:50:03,454 --> 00:50:04,555
Alone.

349
00:50:05,256 --> 00:50:06,355
Okay.

350
00:50:06,357 --> 00:50:08,159
Ivy, one last thing.

351
00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:12,996
You said you left
Mrs. Minskey's

352
00:50:12,998 --> 00:50:14,731
at about nine that night?

353
00:50:14,733 --> 00:50:15,832
And the whole way home

354
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:17,500
you didn't see
any other cars.

355
00:50:17,502 --> 00:50:18,669
Nobody passed you?

356
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:19,736
Okay,
let's start from the beginning.

357
00:50:19,738 --> 00:50:20,771
You guys came
home after shopping.

358
00:50:20,773 --> 00:50:22,706
What'd you get?
What you buy?

359
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:23,774
Did Echo buy anything?

360
00:50:23,776 --> 00:50:24,708
You made dinner,

361
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:26,810
and then you left
at about seven, right?

362
00:50:26,812 --> 00:50:28,244
Any
boyfriend or girlfriend

363
00:50:28,246 --> 00:50:29,645
in the picture
that you know of?

364
00:50:29,647 --> 00:50:31,313
Does she disobey you often?

365
00:50:31,315 --> 00:50:32,749
Do you think
she would hurt herself?

366
00:50:32,751 --> 00:50:34,953
Do you happen to remember
your conversation with her?

367
00:50:52,336 --> 00:50:54,238
I know you're not real.

368
00:50:55,774 --> 00:50:57,976
I'm as real
as I am dead.

369
00:51:08,352 --> 00:51:10,421
I know you're not real.

370
00:51:13,992 --> 00:51:15,861
You're in my head.

371
00:51:16,294 --> 00:51:18,229
I'm not in your head yet.

372
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:22,498
Why don't you go get
your big gun

373
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,602
and shoot me again?

374
00:51:28,907 --> 00:51:30,943
Tell my mother
what you've done.

375
00:52:03,641 --> 00:52:05,610
<i>♪ Far away</i>

376
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:09,112
<i>♪ I watch you drift
away from me</i>

377
00:52:09,114 --> 00:52:11,582
<i>♪ Far away</i>

378
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,788
<i>♪ Far away</i>

379
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,924
<i>♪ I watch
you drift away from me</i>

380
00:52:20,926 --> 00:52:22,726
<i>♪ Far away</i>

381
00:52:26,965 --> 00:52:29,398
<i>For the past fifteen years,</i>

382
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,802
<i>this is where we wind down
from a rough weekend</i>

383
00:52:31,804 --> 00:52:33,636
<i>and prepare
for another week.</i>

384
00:52:33,638 --> 00:52:35,404
<i>In hell.</i>

385
00:52:38,509 --> 00:52:39,810
<i>We got some old,
we got some new,</i>

386
00:52:39,812 --> 00:52:41,111
<i>we got some in between!</i>

387
00:52:41,113 --> 00:52:44,382
<i>Here comes somethin'
fresh from the vault.</i>

388
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,540
<i>Hi.</i>

389
00:53:10,976 --> 00:53:12,543
Echo.

390
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:19,785
<i>I broke my arm.</i>

391
00:53:21,653 --> 00:53:22,988
How?

392
00:53:24,156 --> 00:53:25,958
<i>Sledding.</i>

393
00:53:26,825 --> 00:53:28,457
Where are you, Echo?

394
00:53:30,494 --> 00:53:31,797
Bye.

395
00:54:01,827 --> 00:54:03,128
You okay?

396
00:54:05,496 --> 00:54:06,932
Is that your car?

397
00:54:12,704 --> 00:54:14,438
Can you please move it?

398
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:49,675
<i>Tell my
mother what you've done.</i>

399
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

400
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:29,647
Now I'm in your head.

401
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:33,986
Bye.

402
00:55:39,858 --> 00:55:42,127
<i>Tell my
mother what you've done.</i>

403
00:56:08,687 --> 00:56:12,322
<i>Hey W. H. E.
L. radio ninety-two point one...</i>

404
00:56:12,324 --> 00:56:13,857
What's goin' on buddy?

405
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:16,625
<i>Rockin' the mountains
for over thirty-five years.</i>

406
00:56:16,627 --> 00:56:18,728
<i>You know, this Sunday
we got a big charity,</i>

407
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:21,097
<i>it's close to my heart
and to yours.</i>

408
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:22,132
<i>Am I right?</i>

409
00:56:22,134 --> 00:56:24,000
<i>It's for the Missing
Children's Foundation.</i>

410
00:56:24,002 --> 00:56:25,802
<i>That's right,
lotta kids go missing</i>

411
00:56:25,804 --> 00:56:27,670
<i>and are never found,</i>

412
00:56:27,672 --> 00:56:30,306
<i>and the parents are worried,
so we wanna help them out,</i>

413
00:56:30,308 --> 00:56:32,709
<i>so we do a little
charity event on Sunday...</i>

414
00:56:39,217 --> 00:56:42,752
<i>...and is here on Kid California
and much, much more.</i>

415
00:56:42,754 --> 00:56:44,320
No beer tonight?

416
00:56:44,322 --> 00:56:45,955
<i>It's gonna rock your
world, and help those people...</i>

417
00:56:45,957 --> 00:56:47,459
Cinnamon coffee cake
cappuccinos.

418
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,930
<i>All right,
we have a killer show for you tonight...</i>

419
00:57:04,076 --> 00:57:05,576
Bye.

420
00:57:58,029 --> 00:58:00,165
Thanks for the extra
marshmallows.

421
00:58:04,836 --> 00:58:06,469
So, the old house,

422
00:58:06,471 --> 00:58:09,207
how's the transformation
coming?

423
00:58:10,308 --> 00:58:12,177
It's a struggle.

424
00:58:16,281 --> 00:58:18,016
So, what is this?

425
00:58:20,485 --> 00:58:22,921
Uh, I'm just...

426
00:58:24,122 --> 00:58:26,224
tryin' to find some answers.

427
00:58:31,963 --> 00:58:33,365
About your daughter?

428
00:58:33,965 --> 00:58:36,001
Oh, she's dead.

429
00:58:37,435 --> 00:58:38,968
You see, the cards
are a projection

430
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:42,238
of what we see,

431
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,075
and what's hidden.

432
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,110
And what wants to be seen.

433
00:58:47,112 --> 00:58:48,914
Shuffle.

434
00:59:07,265 --> 00:59:08,934
Hindsight.

435
00:59:10,335 --> 00:59:12,137
Insight.

436
00:59:15,173 --> 00:59:16,975
Foresight.

437
00:59:19,211 --> 00:59:21,179
The Devil.

438
00:59:21,913 --> 00:59:22,745
Don't worry,

439
00:59:22,747 --> 00:59:24,916
it's not always as bad
as it seems.

440
00:59:26,384 --> 00:59:29,419
This card is basically
about bondage.

441
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:31,821
Something from your past,
let's say,

442
00:59:31,823 --> 00:59:35,360
that still has a hold
or sucks life from you.

443
00:59:40,232 --> 00:59:42,234
The High Priestess.

444
00:59:43,068 --> 00:59:45,435
That was Echo's
favorite card.

445
00:59:45,437 --> 00:59:48,974
The authentic blueprint
of our soul.

446
00:59:49,407 --> 00:59:51,474
Perfectly captures
the duality in all of us.

447
00:59:51,476 --> 00:59:52,942
You see the two columns?

448
00:59:52,944 --> 00:59:56,813
Black, white,
male, female.

449
00:59:56,815 --> 00:59:58,982
And then the veil
that she's wearing,

450
00:59:58,984 --> 01:00:02,085
literally the thin veil
between two worlds.

451
01:00:02,087 --> 01:00:04,220
Life and death,

452
01:00:04,222 --> 01:00:06,758
the visible and invisible.

453
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:08,992
And then, of course,

454
01:00:08,994 --> 01:00:10,960
the crescent moon
at her feet to remind us

455
01:00:10,962 --> 01:00:13,265
of the innate power
of femininity.

456
01:00:15,467 --> 01:00:17,934
Cool.

457
01:00:17,936 --> 01:00:19,771
Yeah, it's cool.

458
01:00:20,438 --> 01:00:22,207
This is what's to come?

459
01:00:26,144 --> 01:00:27,946
Ten of swords.

460
01:00:29,547 --> 01:00:31,016
What?

461
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:34,083
All is lost.

462
01:00:34,085 --> 01:00:35,918
Over and done.

463
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,919
Dead.

464
01:00:36,921 --> 01:00:38,990
And yours is in reverse.

465
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:43,261
What's that mean?

466
01:00:44,396 --> 01:00:46,097
Slow pain.

467
01:00:49,067 --> 01:00:50,566
But, look.

468
01:00:50,568 --> 01:00:53,436
You see that sun peeking out
from behind the clouds?

469
01:00:53,438 --> 01:00:54,937
Yeah.

470
01:00:54,939 --> 01:00:57,108
Every end has
a new beginning.

471
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:01,246
At least that's what they say
to make you feel better.

472
01:01:06,418 --> 01:01:08,217
They're just cards.

473
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:09,954
I'm sorry, Kurt.

474
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,159
I gotta piss.

475
01:01:14,926 --> 01:01:16,428
Where's your bathroom?

476
01:01:16,662 --> 01:01:18,396
Upstairs.

477
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:13,318
Ah.

478
01:03:08,106 --> 01:03:09,507
I gotta go.

479
01:03:38,236 --> 01:03:41,206
What are we asking of the
cards today, Miss Allen?

480
01:03:43,274 --> 01:03:45,508
I wanna talk
to my daughter.

481
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:48,146
I wanna talk to my
beautiful Echo.

482
01:03:48,814 --> 01:03:51,449
Can we do that?
Please?

483
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:07,530
Is that a good one
or a bad one?

484
01:04:18,243 --> 01:04:19,575
Whispers in the dark.

485
01:04:19,577 --> 01:04:20,811
Pass through the filament

486
01:04:20,813 --> 01:04:22,645
and pierce
this earthly realm.

487
01:04:22,647 --> 01:04:24,247
Listen now
and hear our calls,

488
01:04:24,249 --> 01:04:26,584
show a sign
within these walls.

489
01:04:28,386 --> 01:04:30,119
Echo?

490
01:04:30,121 --> 01:04:32,290
Echo Allen?

491
01:04:32,858 --> 01:04:35,126
Are you there, Echo?

492
01:04:36,127 --> 01:04:38,429
Where the fuck are you?

493
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,332
Echo, I'm here, honey.

494
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:45,036
I'm here!

495
01:04:47,572 --> 01:04:49,474
Echo?

496
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:52,243
Echo.

497
01:04:55,179 --> 01:04:57,448
Echo, talk to us,
please.

498
01:04:59,384 --> 01:05:01,553
Please talk to us.

499
01:05:03,689 --> 01:05:05,187
Hmm.

500
01:05:05,189 --> 01:05:07,189
The veil is thick.

501
01:05:07,191 --> 01:05:09,093
It won't part.

502
01:05:29,347 --> 01:05:32,515
Please help me
talk to my daughter.

503
01:05:32,517 --> 01:05:34,252
Please.

504
01:05:34,787 --> 01:05:36,588
Nothing.

505
01:05:39,892 --> 01:05:43,694
Tell my
mother what you've done.

506
01:07:57,428 --> 01:07:59,898
Tell my
mother what you've done.

507
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,736
Give her peace.

508
01:08:08,841 --> 01:08:10,575
It was an accident.

509
01:08:13,912 --> 01:08:16,014
It coulda happened
to anyone.

510
01:08:16,547 --> 01:08:19,250
And you shouldn't have
been sledding in the dark.

511
01:08:22,955 --> 01:08:25,858
You shouldn't
have been driving drunk.

512
01:08:27,525 --> 01:08:30,294
You might've
had your eyes on the road.

513
01:08:31,395 --> 01:08:34,131
You might've
known I wasn't dead.

514
01:08:34,133 --> 01:08:36,534
And you
wouldn't have had to murder me.

515
01:08:43,441 --> 01:08:45,476
Get outta my head, kid.

516
01:08:47,478 --> 01:08:49,882
Or I'll
kill your fucking mother.

517
01:08:53,018 --> 01:08:54,853
I'm Kurt.

518
01:08:57,689 --> 01:08:59,590
I'm Kurt.

519
01:09:50,709 --> 01:09:51,910
Shit.

520
01:09:56,849 --> 01:09:58,984
Fuck is that?

521
01:10:15,934 --> 01:10:20,871
<i>Every
morning, every evening</i>

522
01:10:20,873 --> 01:10:23,842
<i>Ain't we got fun?</i>

523
01:10:25,043 --> 01:10:30,013
<i>Not much money,
oh, but honey</i>

524
01:10:30,015 --> 01:10:33,384
<i>Ain't we got fun?</i>

525
01:10:34,152 --> 01:10:38,489
<i>The rent's unpaid, dear</i>

526
01:10:39,057 --> 01:10:42,560
<i>We haven't a bus</i>

527
01:10:43,829 --> 01:10:48,198
<i>But smiles are made, dear</i>

528
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:52,068
<i>For people like us</i>

529
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:56,973
<i>In the winter,
in the summer</i>

530
01:10:56,975 --> 01:11:00,112
<i>Ain't we got fun?</i>

531
01:11:00,913 --> 01:11:05,882
<i>Time's are bum
and gettin' bummer</i>

532
01:11:05,884 --> 01:11:08,921
<i>Still we have fun</i>

533
01:11:10,088 --> 01:11:13,524
<i>There's nothing surer</i>

534
01:11:14,226 --> 01:11:17,495
<i>For people like us</i>

535
01:11:18,664 --> 01:11:23,499
<i>In the morning,
in the evening</i>

536
01:11:23,501 --> 01:11:25,936
<i>Ain't we got fun?</i>

537
01:11:50,628 --> 01:11:52,662
<i>I can't wait.</i>

538
01:11:52,664 --> 01:11:54,700
<i>It's almost hunting season.</i>

539
01:11:55,067 --> 01:11:56,800
You feelin' lucky?

540
01:11:56,802 --> 01:11:58,634
<i>I'm feelin' deadly.</i>

541
01:11:58,636 --> 01:12:01,537
How old were you
when you started hunting?

542
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:02,872
<i>Eight.</i>

543
01:12:02,874 --> 01:12:06,309
So, six seasons,

544
01:12:06,311 --> 01:12:08,046
six shots,

545
01:12:09,047 --> 01:12:11,014
six bucks.

546
01:12:11,016 --> 01:12:13,185
You got this year's
tags yet?

547
01:12:15,787 --> 01:12:17,287
Come on,

548
01:12:17,289 --> 01:12:20,256
seven's the perfect number.

549
01:12:20,258 --> 01:12:22,227
It's got to be complete.

550
01:12:24,196 --> 01:12:25,862
Do you think deer
know they're dying

551
01:12:25,864 --> 01:12:27,563
when they've been shot?

552
01:12:27,565 --> 01:12:28,865
Yeah.

553
01:12:28,867 --> 01:12:30,300
Sure.

554
01:12:30,302 --> 01:12:31,101
I don't.

555
01:12:31,103 --> 01:12:32,769
Animals don't know
the difference

556
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:34,706
between life or death.

557
01:12:35,707 --> 01:12:38,108
But when humans die,

558
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:40,511
they know what
they're gonna miss.

559
01:12:42,948 --> 01:12:45,015
Mom?

560
01:12:45,017 --> 01:12:47,817
Would you still love me
if I murdered someone?

561
01:12:47,819 --> 01:12:49,919
I'll always love you.

562
01:12:49,921 --> 01:12:51,221
No matter what.

563
01:12:51,223 --> 01:12:53,859
Even if I killed
someone you loved?

564
01:12:54,659 --> 01:12:56,161
Always.

565
01:13:11,777 --> 01:13:14,146
Hey, I carved you
a pumpkin.

566
01:13:15,947 --> 01:13:18,250
Y'know, for Halloween.

567
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:25,055
In case anybody came over
I thought you might want...

568
01:13:25,057 --> 01:13:26,590
one.

569
01:13:31,129 --> 01:13:32,228
What?

570
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:34,766
It just reminds me
of Echo.

571
01:13:36,034 --> 01:13:38,334
She always used
to carve a pumpkin,

572
01:13:38,336 --> 01:13:41,137
hoping trick-or-treaters
would come but

573
01:13:41,139 --> 01:13:43,041
nobody comes up here.

574
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:50,080
She really loved
this time of year.

575
01:13:50,082 --> 01:13:51,917
Halloween...

576
01:13:53,051 --> 01:13:55,187
then hunting season.

577
01:13:56,088 --> 01:13:58,757
What more could
a Goth kid ask for?

578
01:14:02,928 --> 01:14:05,261
- You takin' a walk?
- Yeah,

579
01:14:05,263 --> 01:14:08,665
just a little
mental homework.

580
01:14:08,667 --> 01:14:10,035
Fuck homework.

581
01:14:23,682 --> 01:14:25,350
Thanks, Kurt.

582
01:15:47,465 --> 01:15:49,265
- Hey.
- Hey.

583
01:15:49,267 --> 01:15:51,770
I was just...

584
01:15:54,272 --> 01:15:56,139
There's really good hunting
behind your house.

585
01:15:56,141 --> 01:15:58,007
That was Echo's favorite spot.

586
01:15:58,009 --> 01:15:59,943
I don't really like goin' alone.
You wanna go?

587
01:15:59,945 --> 01:16:01,077
Go hunting?

588
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:01,945
Do you hunt?

589
01:16:01,947 --> 01:16:03,846
Yeah.
I'd love to.

590
01:16:03,848 --> 01:16:06,282
I... I just got a shotgun
though, uh,

591
01:16:06,284 --> 01:16:07,784
and no tags.

592
01:16:07,786 --> 01:16:09,018
I got an open tag.

593
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:10,286
Lemme get my hat
and my gun

594
01:16:10,288 --> 01:16:12,224
and we'll go.

595
01:16:57,002 --> 01:16:58,470
It's cold.

596
01:17:16,988 --> 01:17:19,489
Last year, Echo bagged
a buck out here

597
01:17:19,491 --> 01:17:21,557
in under thirty minutes.

598
01:17:21,559 --> 01:17:23,094
Nice.

599
01:17:24,496 --> 01:17:27,399
She said this year she was
aiming for under twenty.

600
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:31,467
Alright, I can do it.

601
01:17:31,469 --> 01:17:32,969
Oh yeah?

602
01:17:32,971 --> 01:17:34,406
Sure.

603
01:17:39,577 --> 01:17:42,147
Let's split up
and find out.

604
01:18:44,275 --> 01:18:46,277
Oh, fuck.

605
01:19:02,327 --> 01:19:03,993
Snuck up on that
pretty fast.

606
01:19:03,995 --> 01:19:05,463
What're you,
some kinda ghost?

607
01:19:07,499 --> 01:19:09,232
That's seven.

608
01:19:09,234 --> 01:19:11,002
It's complete.

609
01:19:13,338 --> 01:19:15,140
What'd you just say?

610
01:19:19,244 --> 01:19:21,146
Kurt.

611
01:19:44,035 --> 01:19:45,170
<i>Hey wait!</i>

612
01:19:45,437 --> 01:19:46,938
<i>Hey wait!</i>

613
01:19:48,473 --> 01:19:49,574
<i>Hold on!</i>

614
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:51,376
<i>Hold on!</i>

615
01:19:52,577 --> 01:19:54,243
<i>Stop for a second.</i>

616
01:19:54,245 --> 01:19:55,714
<i>Stop for a second.</i>

617
01:20:08,626 --> 01:20:10,195
Did you hear that?

618
01:20:12,063 --> 01:20:13,666
That echo?

619
01:20:14,466 --> 01:20:17,035
I've never heard an echo
in these woods.

620
01:20:17,569 --> 01:20:19,270
And in the snow.

621
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:25,109
I'm almost here.

622
01:20:25,577 --> 01:20:27,111
What?

623
01:20:29,815 --> 01:20:32,450
I'm... I'm almost here.

624
01:20:34,085 --> 01:20:35,453
Kurt.

625
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,489
I'm Kurt.

626
01:20:44,629 --> 01:20:46,331
I'm Kurt.

627
01:20:50,803 --> 01:20:52,771
<i>Mom?</i>

628
01:21:27,272 --> 01:21:29,107
<i>I love you.</i>

629
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:08,177
Candles glowing,
shadows throwing,

630
01:22:08,179 --> 01:22:10,448
cards ready,
ever knowing.

631
01:22:11,482 --> 01:22:13,817
A mockery I made of thee.

632
01:22:13,819 --> 01:22:16,554
Blind no more,
I choose to see.

633
01:22:17,756 --> 01:22:20,389
I swallow whole
the worm of shame,

634
01:22:20,391 --> 01:22:23,161
and turn my nature
towards the flame.

635
01:22:23,929 --> 01:22:25,829
My purpose to
the truth affixed,

636
01:22:25,831 --> 01:22:28,701
I call upon the Circle Six.

637
01:22:29,534 --> 01:22:33,104
I turn a card;
I beg it shows...

638
01:22:34,539 --> 01:22:37,108
the secrets that
my daughter knows.

639
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

640
01:23:38,369 --> 01:23:39,872
Oh!

641
01:23:43,608 --> 01:23:45,476
Ha-ha-ha!

642
01:23:56,722 --> 01:23:59,255
Detective
Sanford, it's Ivy Allen.

643
01:23:59,257 --> 01:24:03,394
I think I have some
information on Echo's killer.

644
01:24:04,328 --> 01:24:07,396
I know, I know, but,
I know she's dead.

645
01:24:07,398 --> 01:24:09,668
Because I'm her mother
and I know.

646
01:24:10,936 --> 01:24:13,504
Because I've seen things.

647
01:24:14,505 --> 01:24:17,606
Signs she's been sending me.

648
01:24:17,608 --> 01:24:19,943
And then
the cards last night,

649
01:24:19,945 --> 01:24:22,411
I... I pulled the High Priestess
card, that's Echo.

650
01:24:22,413 --> 01:24:24,047
And then I pulled
the Devil card, that's him!

651
01:24:24,049 --> 01:24:25,684
That's my...

652
01:24:29,587 --> 01:24:31,957
Yeah. Okay.

653
01:27:32,637 --> 01:27:33,837
Hi.

654
01:27:48,887 --> 01:27:50,552
Ow.

655
01:27:52,057 --> 01:27:53,555
Echo.

656
01:28:11,043 --> 01:28:12,876
It was an accident.

657
01:28:12,878 --> 01:28:14,980
She never should've been
sledding in the dark.

658
01:28:39,204 --> 01:28:40,772
Oh!

659
01:29:07,933 --> 01:29:09,733
Ah!

660
01:29:22,814 --> 01:29:24,182
Ah!

661
01:30:07,092 --> 01:30:08,860
Ah!

662
01:30:14,866 --> 01:30:17,769
That was cunty,
and I like it.

663
01:30:20,939 --> 01:30:22,705
But...

664
01:30:22,707 --> 01:30:23,873
Oh my God.

665
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:25,842
Don't pull it...
don't pull it out!

666
01:30:25,844 --> 01:30:28,244
- But it hurts.
- Don't pull it out!

667
01:30:30,415 --> 01:30:32,984
There's so much blood.

668
01:30:35,387 --> 01:30:37,122
Echo?

669
01:30:41,026 --> 01:30:42,792
Mom.

670
01:30:42,794 --> 01:30:44,694
Come closer.

671
01:30:44,696 --> 01:30:46,296
Echo.

672
01:30:46,298 --> 01:30:48,200
Come here, please.

673
01:31:30,375 --> 01:31:32,308
Ow!

674
01:31:46,758 --> 01:31:48,293
We won.

675
01:32:30,835 --> 01:32:33,071
I made it
just how you like it.

676
01:32:33,939 --> 01:32:36,107
Extra marshmallows.

677
01:33:06,871 --> 01:33:08,071
