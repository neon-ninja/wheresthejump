1
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:36,833
I was dreamin'.

2
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:40,503
Dreamin' my dick was out
and I was checking to see

3
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:43,907
if that infected bump on the head
of it had filled with pus again.

4
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:46,741
If it had, I was gonna name
that bump after my ex-wife Priscilla

5
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:48,906
and bust it by jackin' off.

6
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:50,040
Oh, man.

7
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:51,947
Or I'd like to think that's what I'd do.

8
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:55,117
Dreams let you think like that.

9
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:59,648
Truth was, I hadn't had
a hard-on in years.

10
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,039
Oh, man.

11
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:59,508
My God, man.
How long have I been here?

12
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:03,078
Am I really awake now,
or am I just dreamin' I'm awake?

13
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:06,319
How could my plans
have gone so wrong?

14
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:08,554
When the hell are they
gonna serve lunch?

15
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:11,358
Considerin' what they serve,
why the hell do I care?

16
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:16,833
If Priscilla discovered I was alive,
would she come and see me?

17
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:21,169
Would we still wanna fuck?
Or would we merely have to talk about it?

18
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,970
Is there, finally and really,

19
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:26,376
anything to life other than
food, shit, and sex?

20
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,781
Well, goddamnit.

21
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,788
How could I have gone from
the "King of rock and roll"to this?

22
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:46,158
Old guy in a rest home in East Texas
with a growth on his pecker.

23
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,375
And what is that growth, man?

24
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:09,183
Cancer? Nobody's talkin'.

25
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:12,781
No one seems to know...
or wants to.

26
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:18,684
Makes you wonder, doesn't it,
what kind of life this old guy had?

27
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:23,660
W hat kind of life he had, you know.
His kids, his grandkids, his legacy.

28
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,890
Look at him now.

29
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:26,625
Oh, who gives a shit?

30
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:10,006
W ell...

31
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:22,548
Make you comfortable.

32
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,224
No.

33
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

34
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:13,891
I'm gonna squish you, cockroach!

35
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:19,587
Help me.

36
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,781
You know, I was thinkin'...

37
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:16,015
W hat? You gonna get
all weepy on me again?

38
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,082
No. I was merely gonna suggest that you
use some of this here deodorizer

39
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,651
and spray it on that corpse
because she's smellin' pretty ripe.

40
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:28,698
Good idea.

41
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:41,870
Excuse me, miss?

42
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:44,604
You gonna throw all that stuff out?

43
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:46,669
Yeah.

44
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:49,579
Could I have one
of them pictures of Bull?

45
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,415
Maybe his... his Purple Heart?

46
00:12:53,286 --> 00:12:55,948
I mean,
he was pretty proud of that.

47
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:59,719
And maybe that... that tin
of chocolates there?

48
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,125
I suppose.

49
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:12,431
The revealin' of her panties
wasn't intentional or unintentional.

50
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:13,995
She just didn't give a damn.

51
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:17,133
She saw me as so physically
and sexually non-threatenin',

52
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,475
she didn't mind if I got
a bird's-eye view of her love nest.

53
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:23,276
It was the same to her
as a house cat sneakin' a peek.

54
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,184
I felt my pecker flutter once like
a pigeon havin' a heart attack...

55
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:31,515
then it laid back down
and remained limp and still.

56
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:35,251
'Course, these days, even a flutter
was kind of reassurin'.

57
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,361
- Here.
- Thank you.

58
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:41,093
Say...

59
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:43,163
Bull your kin?

60
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:44,396
My daddy.

61
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:48,603
Never seen you here before.

62
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:53,003
I've only been here once before.
W hen I checked him in.

63
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:55,877
That's three years ago, wasn't it?

64
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,681
You and him friends?

65
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,948
No, we just roommates. I mean,
he never felt good enough to say much.

66
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:05,751
I just hated to see what
was left of him go away so easy.

67
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:10,493
Seemed like an all right guy.

68
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:14,499
Mentioned you a lot.
You're... you're Callie, right?

69
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,057
Yeah.

70
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:18,467
W ell... he was all right.

71
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:21,600
But not enough so you'd
come and see him, though.

72
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:25,933
Don't lay some guilt trip on me, mister.
I did what I could.

73
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:29,675
I mean, if it hadn't been for Medicaid
or Medicare... whatever that stuff was...

74
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:31,649
he'd have been
in some ditch somewhere.

75
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:36,644
And I sure didn't have the money
to take care of him.

76
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,790
My own daughter...

77
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,895
Iost long ago to me...

78
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:47,899
if she knew I lived,
would she come and see me?

79
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:49,366
Would she even care?

80
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:53,828
You could've come and seen him.
They don't charge you for that.

81
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,939
Mind your own business.

82
00:14:57,376 --> 00:14:58,866
I was busy.

83
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:17,590
W ell, well, well.
If it isn't my favorite patient.

84
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:19,654
How are you this morning, Mr. Haff?

85
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:21,393
I'm all right.

86
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:24,868
But I prefer Mr. Presley or Elvis.
I keep tellin' you that.

87
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:27,428
I don't go by
Sebastian Haff anymore, okay?

88
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,769
I'm not tryin' to hide anymore.

89
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:32,777
W ell, of course I knew that.
I forgot.

90
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:35,177
Good morning, Elvis.

91
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,814
Did you knowwe have
a celebrity here, Miss Thomas?

92
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:44,014
Elvis Presley. You know,
the rock and roll singer.

93
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:47,185
I thought he was dead.

94
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:52,190
W ell, actually, Elvis is dead.
Mr. Haff knows that. Don't you, Mr. Haff?

95
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:55,530
Hell, no. I'm right here.
I ain't dead.

96
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:57,398
Yet.

97
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,303
Now, Mr. Haff!

98
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:03,035
I don't mind calling you "Elvis."

99
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:05,942
But you're a little confused
and you like to play sometimes.

100
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:10,881
You were an
Elvis impersonator, remember?

101
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,887
You fell off the stage
and broke your hip... when was it?

102
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:17,445
Twenty years ago.

103
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:21,357
It got infected and you were
in a coma for quite a while.

104
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:25,761
You came out with a few...
problems.

105
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:31,798
Look, I was just impersonatin' myself.
I couldn't do nothin' else.

106
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:33,202
I don't have any problems.

107
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:35,365
You're tryin' to say
my brain's messed up, aren't you?

108
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:37,932
W hy would you
wanna be somebody else?

109
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:40,104
I got tired of it.

110
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:43,004
I was hooked on pills, you know.

111
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:44,674
I wanted out.

112
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,480
And this boy Sebastian Haff...
he was an Elvis imitator.

113
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:50,386
He was the best of 'em.
He took my place.

114
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:52,852
Problem is, he had a bad heart.

115
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:56,025
He liked drugs, too.
Liked them more than I did.

116
00:16:56,095 --> 00:17:00,122
So it was him that died, not me.
I just took his place.

117
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:04,067
But why would you want
to leave all that fame, Mr. Presley?

118
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:06,728
All that money?

119
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:09,138
I don't know.
'Cause they got old.

120
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:17,239
The woman I loved... Priscilla...
she was gone.

121
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:19,978
The rest of the women...
werejust women.

122
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:24,147
I mean, the music
wasn't mine anymore.

123
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,215
I wasn't even me anymore.
Just this thing they made up.

124
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:31,226
And my friends...

125
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,664
Well, they were suckin' me dry.

126
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:43,035
So I took a little road trip
down to Nacogdoches...

127
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:48,036
to check out this Sebastian Haff.

128
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:36,755
It's all right, boys.
Just wait here.

129
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:01,913
Oh, my God.

130
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,390
I didn't think you'd really...

131
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:33,816
It's all right, boys.
Just another freak.

132
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:36,481
Let's split.

133
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:51,768
- Sorry, man.
- King, I got it. I got it.

134
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:53,168
It's all yours, baby.

135
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:04,948
So I signed everything
over to Sebastian.

136
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:08,509
Except for enough money
to sustain me if things got bad.

137
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:11,613
I was determined
to make myself a new life.

138
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,021
A better one.

139
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:18,023
But me and Sebastian,
we had us a deal.

140
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,090
If I wanted to trade back, he'd let me.

141
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:25,326
It was all written up in the contract.

142
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:27,997
The thing was...

143
00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:30,564
I lost my copy
in a barbeque accident.

144
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,469
But that wasn't so bad, either.

145
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:36,709
I was makin' new friends
and enjoyin' myself.

146
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:40,445
Cheers!

147
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,090
Oh, my God.
Did you see that thing?

148
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:59,026
It just went up like that.

149
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:03,169
- Now, Elvis.
- Yes?

150
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:07,436
Don't carry it too far.

151
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:11,506
You may just get way out there
and not come back.

152
00:21:12,651 --> 00:21:14,141
Oh, fuck you.

153
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:17,645
Shit.

154
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:21,215
Get old, you can't even cuss
someone and have it bother 'em.

155
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:25,286
Everything you do is either
worthless or sadly amusing.

156
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:27,498
W ell...

157
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:29,397
I've got what I want.

158
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:33,102
The clothes can go
to Goodwill or Salvation Army.

159
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:37,802
V ery well. And I'm sorry about
your father. He was a nice man.

160
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:39,343
Yeah.

161
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:42,103
It was nice to meet you, Mr. Presley.

162
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:44,376
- Get the hell out.
- Now, now.

163
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:51,588
I'll be back later to do that little... thing
that has to be done. You know.

164
00:21:56,228 --> 00:21:57,286
Elvis!

165
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:09,133
Poor Bull.

166
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:15,307
In the end...
does anything really matter?

167
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:21,476
No one here ever listened to me.

168
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:26,557
Except this one guy...
only, he was certifiable.

169
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,820
That's where they took
a piece of my brain.

170
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:32,352
They got it back in D.C.
in that goddamn jar.

171
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:37,359
I got a little bag of sand
up there now.

172
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:40,928
Jack... no offense, but...

173
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:43,941
President Kennedy was a white man.

174
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:46,000
That's how clever they are!

175
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:49,070
They dyed me this color.
All over!

176
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:52,549
Can you think of a better way
to hide the truth than that?

177
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

178
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:52,670
I was livin' simple.

179
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,574
The way Haff had been.

180
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:58,639
Going from town to town
doin' the Elvis act.

181
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:01,951
Only, I felt like I
was really me again.

182
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,351
Can you dig that?

183
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:06,687
W e're diggin' it, Mr. Haff...
Mr. Presley.

184
00:24:44,696 --> 00:24:46,186
Women were
throwin' themselves at me

185
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:48,199
'cause they could imagine I was Elvis.

186
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:52,135
Only, I was Elvis playing
Sebastian Haff playing Elvis.

187
00:24:52,204 --> 00:24:53,694
It was all pretty good.

188
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:55,865
I didn't mind the contract
being burned up.

189
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:58,102
Didn't even try to go back
and convince anybody.

190
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:01,939
Then I had the accident.

191
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:05,245
I was gyratin', see, takin' care business,
and then my hip went out.

192
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:08,614
I'd been havin' trouble with it.

193
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,267
Damn. It's cold in here tonight.

194
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,313
No way. That's it.
This time, I make it.

195
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:44,821
No more piss or crap
in the bed.

196
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:11,813
Shake it out...

197
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:23,058
There we go.

198
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Man... that is one
big bitch cockroach.

199
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:35,161
All right, man. Let's go.

200
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:45,666
Damn.

201
00:27:49,715 --> 00:27:51,444
Hot damn!

202
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:22,844
Got you, you six-legged bastard.

203
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

204
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:07,485
Even a big bitch cockroach
like you should know...

205
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,354
Never... but never fuck with the King.

206
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:34,746
Hey! Is anybody out here?

207
00:29:39,524 --> 00:29:42,357
I think we got some major
bug problems in this place, man!

208
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

209
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:51,595
Oh, man...

210
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:54,223
Hey, Jack?

211
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:07,375
Hey, man, you okay?

212
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:16,877
W hat the Sam Hill is that?

213
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:21,452
Mr. Kennedy?

214
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,763
Hey, man...
you're on the floor.

215
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:34,399
No shit.

216
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,968
W ho are you?

217
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,136
Look, I'm...

218
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:43,572
Sebastian. Sebastian Haff.

219
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:46,976
Did you see him go by in the hall?

220
00:31:48,286 --> 00:31:50,447
He scuttled like.

221
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:53,918
- W ho, man?
- The one they sent.

222
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:58,317
- W ho's "they"?
- Oh, you knowwho.

223
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:00,125
No, Jack, I don't.
Come on, man.

224
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,931
Lyndon Johnson.

225
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,492
Castro, maybe.

226
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,562
They sent somebody to finish me off.

227
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,803
I think maybe it was Johnson himself.

228
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:15,903
Real ugly.
Real goddamn ugly!

229
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:18,245
Look, man,
President Johnson's dead.

230
00:32:18,316 --> 00:32:21,808
Shit. That ain't gonna stop him.

231
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:28,185
Get his feet.

232
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,258
So, you say you heard a... a noise?

233
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:40,202
W ell, a sound's a sound, you know?
I mean, I heard something.

234
00:32:40,272 --> 00:32:44,675
It was like a... I don't know.
Like a... like a scuttling.

235
00:32:44,743 --> 00:32:47,268
- A scuttling sound?
- Yes, sir.

236
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,172
W ere you awake or were you
in bed when you heard this noise?

237
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,084
I was in bed first, then I was awake
'cause the damn bugs woke me up.

238
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:57,985
You got bugs all over this place.

239
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:03,856
Bugs... well, Mr. Haff, what kind
of bugs have you been seeing?

240
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:06,328
Look, do I look like
an ichthyologist to you?

241
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:07,558
Big damn bugs, all right?

242
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:10,795
The size of my fist. The size
of a peanut butter and banana sandwich.

243
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:13,201
W hat do I care?
I got a growtth on my pecker.

244
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:15,432
Okay, Mr. Haff.
Don't worry about a thing.

245
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:18,943
W e'll call the exterminator tomorrow
and we'll take care of the problem.

246
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,841
Good. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

247
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,597
It's time for that little thing again.

248
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:17,426
A doll like this handlin' me
without warmth or emotion...

249
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:19,493
Twenty years ago.
Just twenty, man.

250
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:23,234
I could've made with the curly-lip smile
and had her eatin' out of my asshole.

251
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:28,575
Doctor says this cream
ought to do the trick.

252
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:30,807
Corticosteroids.

253
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:34,613
Should heal the inflammation,
stop the pus.

254
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:37,712
Where'd my youth go?

255
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:41,992
Why didn't fame
hold off old age and death?

256
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,722
Why the hell did I leave
the fame in the first place?

257
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:46,457
Do I want it back?
Could I have it back?

258
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:50,023
And if I could...
would it make any damn difference?

259
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:14,180
Mr. Haff!

260
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:22,764
Lord almighty.

261
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:27,096
You old rascal.

262
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:32,832
I think you better take
a cold shower, Mr. Haff.

263
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:37,411
There'd been two presidential elections
since I had a boner like that one.

264
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:38,972
What gave here?

265
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,950
Then I realized what gave.

266
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:43,214
I was thinkin' about something
that interested me.

267
00:35:43,288 --> 00:35:45,347
Not my next meal
or goin' to the crapper.

268
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:48,456
I'd been given a dose of life again.

269
00:35:53,064 --> 00:35:55,430
You get in there with me,
I'll take that shower.

270
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,991
You silly thing.

271
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:00,629
Come on, now.
W hy don't you pull on it a little?

272
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:04,671
You ought to be ashamed.

273
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:42,874
W here at? W here at?

274
00:36:42,947 --> 00:36:44,175
I haven't seen my kids.

275
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:45,409
It's an ambush!

276
00:36:47,886 --> 00:36:51,014
Under the bridge.
I saw him under the bridge.

277
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:55,124
It's an ambush!
Tonto, my boots, Tonto!

278
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:58,924
That's my friend Kemosabe.
We used to play cards together.

279
00:36:58,997 --> 00:37:01,989
- My boots!
- Now he doesn't even know who I am.

280
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:01,518
Daddy.

281
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:07,791
Baby?

282
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

283
00:38:14,906 --> 00:38:18,740
Sebastian. Sebastian! It's loose!

284
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,970
W hat's loose?

285
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:21,636
lt. Listen.

286
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,684
Jesus Christ. W hat's that?

287
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,728
I thought it was Lyndon Johnson,
but I was wrong.

288
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:41,356
I've come across new evidence
to suggest another assassin.

289
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,161
Assassin?

290
00:38:44,235 --> 00:38:46,829
He's after another target tonight.

291
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:48,804
Come on, I wanna show you something.

292
00:38:48,873 --> 00:38:51,341
I don't think it's safe
if you go back to sleeping.

293
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:54,037
For chrissake, man.
Just tell the administrators.

294
00:38:55,613 --> 00:38:58,707
Suits and white starches?
No, thank you!

295
00:38:58,783 --> 00:39:03,083
I trusted them when I was back in Dallas,
and look where they got my brain and me.

296
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:06,146
I'm thinkin' with sand here.

297
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:09,387
I mean, I pick up some waves,
maybe, from my brain,

298
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,291
but someday, who knows.

299
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:14,525
Somebody might just disconnect
the battery at the W hite House.

300
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:17,762
Oh, yeah. That's something
to worry about, all right.

301
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,701
Listen here. Listen.

302
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:24,605
I know you're Elvis.

303
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,814
There was a rumor, you know,
that you hated me.

304
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:38,287
But I thought about that.

305
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:43,817
If you hated me, you could've
finished me off the other night.

306
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:49,497
W hat I want from you is
that you look me straight in the eye

307
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:54,732
and assure me you had nothing
at all to do with that day in Dallas,

308
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:58,867
and that you did not know
Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby.

309
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:08,345
Look, man...

310
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:10,580
I had nothing to do with Dallas.

311
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:14,216
And I knew neither
Lee Harvey Oswald nor Jack Ruby.

312
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:19,792
Good. May I call you Elvis
instead of Sebastian?

313
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:21,659
You may.

314
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:23,223
Excellent.

315
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:24,962
You wear glasses to read?

316
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:27,527
W ell, I wear glasses
when I really want to see.

317
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,596
Get them. Come on.

318
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:37,203
Come on.
Right down the hall.

319
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:42,252
The walker was
swingin' along easier now.

320
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,651
Not even like I needed it.

321
00:40:44,455 --> 00:40:46,616
Damn, this here Jack was a nut.

322
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:49,349
Maybe I was nuts, too...

323
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:51,657
but there was
an adventure goin' on.

324
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:52,821
It's in here.

325
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:00,562
In here.

326
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:13,614
That's it?

327
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:17,245
W e're investigating a scuttling in the hall,
trying to figure out who attacked you,

328
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:20,154
and you bring me here to look
at stick pictures on the shit house wall?

329
00:41:20,224 --> 00:41:21,748
Look close.

330
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:42,405
It's Egyptian.

331
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,879
Right-a-reen-o.

332
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:47,884
Hey, you're not as stupid
as some folks made you out.

333
00:41:47,952 --> 00:41:52,912
- Thank you.
- Now, I copied this down yesterday.

334
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:57,518
I came in here to take a shit because
they hadn't cleaned up my bathroom.

335
00:41:57,595 --> 00:42:00,928
Saw that on the wall,
took it back to my room,

336
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:03,694
looked it up in my books,
and I wrote it all down.

337
00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:09,764
Now, this top line
translates roughly into,

338
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:13,675
"Pharaoh gobbles donkey goobers."

339
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:18,238
And the bottom line,
"Cleopatra does the nasty."

340
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:19,374
Say what?

341
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:22,180
W ell, pretty much.
That's the best I can translate it.

342
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:26,779
All right, so, one of the nuts in here...
present company excluded...

343
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:29,691
thinks he's Tutankhamen,
comes in here, writes hieroglyphics.

344
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,854
Big deal! W hat's the connection?
W hy are we standin' here in the toilet?

345
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,331
W ell, I don't knowwhat
the connection is, exactly... not yet.

346
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,995
But that thing
caught me asleep last night.

347
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:42,562
And I came awake just in time.

348
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,369
He had me on the floor.

349
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:48,139
I had his mouth over my asshole.

350
00:42:48,212 --> 00:42:49,372
A shit-eater?

351
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:50,937
I don't think so.

352
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:53,745
He was after my soul.

353
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:57,686
Now, you can get that out of any
major orifice of a person's body.

354
00:42:57,755 --> 00:42:58,813
I read about it.

355
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,949
Yeah? W here, man? Hustler?

356
00:43:01,025 --> 00:43:04,961
The Everyday Man Or Woman's
Book of the Soul by David W ebb.

357
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:07,259
And they got pretty good
movie reviews in there

358
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:10,266
about stolen soul movies
in the back.

359
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,359
Come on. I'll show you.

360
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

361
00:44:11,662 --> 00:44:16,224
I think that there might be some sort
of electrical problem in the gardener's shed.

362
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,235
That light...
looks like it's shortin' out.

363
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:21,897
This whole damn place is fallin' apart.

364
00:44:21,973 --> 00:44:24,134
But you don't have to think about that.

365
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:27,200
Mrs. Biddlestein is waitin'
on her enema.

366
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:31,146
All right. All right. I'm comin'.

367
00:44:33,184 --> 00:44:36,244
Just let me finish my cigarette, first.

368
00:44:37,188 --> 00:44:38,348
God.

369
00:45:30,274 --> 00:45:31,969
Here's an ugly son of a bitch.

370
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:44,313
Damn! Hey, Jack.

371
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:47,551
W hat it says here
is that you can bury some dude,

372
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:52,619
and if he gets the right tanna leaves
and spells said over him and such bullshit,

373
00:45:52,696 --> 00:45:56,029
that he can come back to life
thousands of years later, man.

374
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:57,825
But hold on, now.

375
00:45:57,902 --> 00:46:01,668
To stay alive, he has to suck
on the souls of the livin',

376
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:05,402
and that if the souls are small,
his life force doesn't last long.

377
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:08,338
Small.
W hat's that mean?

378
00:46:08,412 --> 00:46:10,903
Read on.
No, never mind.

379
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:12,642
I'll tell you myself.

380
00:46:13,384 --> 00:46:16,182
But first,
would you like a Ding Dong?

381
00:46:17,588 --> 00:46:19,078
I don't mean mine.

382
00:46:19,957 --> 00:46:21,618
I mean a chocolate Ding Dong.

383
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:25,951
Of course, mine would be chocolate
now that I have been dyed.

384
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,554
You got Ding Dongs, man?

385
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:31,691
I got Paydays
and I got a box of Baby Ruths.

386
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:33,100
Oh, mama!

387
00:46:34,939 --> 00:46:38,534
W hich will it be?
Let's get decadent.

388
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:40,805
I'll take a Baby Ruth.

389
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:45,014
All right.

390
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:50,218
Now... small souls...

391
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:54,918
are those that don't have
much fire for life.

392
00:46:54,992 --> 00:46:56,459
You know a place like that?

393
00:46:56,527 --> 00:47:00,520
Man, if souls were fires,
they couldn't burn much lower than in here.

394
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:02,361
Exactamundo.

395
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:07,769
W hat we have here at Shady Rest
is an Egyptian soul sucker of some sort.

396
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:10,329
You know, a mummy hiding out.

397
00:47:10,407 --> 00:47:13,899
Coming in here,
feeding on the sleeping.

398
00:47:13,978 --> 00:47:16,139
It's perfect, you see?

399
00:47:16,213 --> 00:47:19,876
W e're small souls,
so we can't provide him much.

400
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:24,954
But if that thing comes back
two or three times in a row

401
00:47:25,022 --> 00:47:29,721
and wraps his lips
around some elder's asshole,

402
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:33,524
that elder is going to die pretty soon.

403
00:47:33,597 --> 00:47:35,963
And who would be the wiser?

404
00:47:55,953 --> 00:47:57,284
Asshole.

405
00:47:59,323 --> 00:48:02,690
A mummy can't be getting
too much energy from all this...

406
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,890
not like with big souls...
but the prey is easy.

407
00:48:07,431 --> 00:48:11,925
W ith new people comin' all the time, he can
keep this up forever... this soul robbin'.

408
00:48:12,002 --> 00:48:13,731
That's what they
brought us here for...

409
00:48:13,804 --> 00:48:16,398
to get us out of the way
until we die.

410
00:48:16,473 --> 00:48:22,309
And those who don't die first from
disease or just plain being old, he gets.

411
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,714
Look, that's all well and good, Jack,
but there's one thing that still throws me.

412
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:31,914
How does an ancient Egyptian
wind up in an East Texas rest home,

413
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:35,220
and why is he writin'
on the shit house walls, man?

414
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:37,783
W ell, he went in to take a crap,

415
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:40,728
got bored,
started writing on the walls.

416
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:44,199
He probably wrote
on pyramid walls centuries ago.

417
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:47,237
Come on. W hat would he crap?
It's not like he'd eat.

418
00:48:47,304 --> 00:48:49,465
W ell, he eats souls.

419
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,306
So, I assume
that he would crap soul residue.

420
00:48:53,377 --> 00:48:57,279
By that, I would mean
that if you die from his mouth,

421
00:48:57,348 --> 00:49:00,340
you don't go to the other side
where the souls go.

422
00:49:00,417 --> 00:49:05,514
He digests souls
until they don't exist anymore.

423
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:09,423
And you're just so much
toilet water decoration.

424
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:11,859
And speaking of toilets...

425
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:15,387
This is how I figured
that whole thing out.

426
00:49:16,267 --> 00:49:19,498
He's just like anybody else
when it comes to taking a dump.

427
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:22,061
He wants a nice,
clean place with a flush.

428
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:23,970
They didn't have that in his time.

429
00:49:47,865 --> 00:49:49,924
No, no.
Don't go out in the hall.

430
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,800
- That's all right. I'm not asleep.
- That don't mean he won't hurt you.

431
00:49:53,871 --> 00:49:57,432
"He" my ass. There isn't
any mummy from Egypt.

432
00:50:01,478 --> 00:50:03,537
Nice knowin' you, Elvis.

433
00:52:25,556 --> 00:52:26,716
Asshole.

434
00:53:34,124 --> 00:53:37,457
Kemosabe was dead of a ruptured heart
before he hit the floor.

435
00:53:40,264 --> 00:53:42,755
Gone down and out
with both guns blazing.

436
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:45,867
Soul intact.

437
00:53:49,973 --> 00:53:52,237
Once again, we got scolded.

438
00:53:54,311 --> 00:53:57,246
This time, we got quizzed about
what had happened to Kemosabe,

439
00:53:57,314 --> 00:53:59,714
but neither of us told the truth.

440
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:03,479
I mean, who was gonna believe
a couple of nuts?

441
00:54:04,755 --> 00:54:06,586
Elvis and Jack Kennedy explaining

442
00:54:06,657 --> 00:54:09,717
that Kemosabe was gunning
for a mummy in cowboy duds?

443
00:54:09,793 --> 00:54:12,455
Some kind of Bubba Ho-Tep?

444
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,129
So, what we did was...

445
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:17,827
we lied.

446
00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:04,110
Life sure is fleetin', you know?

447
00:55:04,181 --> 00:55:07,514
- W hat?
- Life. I'm saying it's fleetin'.

448
00:55:07,584 --> 00:55:10,246
One minute you're here,
and the next minute you're gone...

449
00:55:12,122 --> 00:55:14,283
Shit! Shit! Come on!

450
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:18,558
Come on. Move it!
Come on. Get it!

451
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:24,427
Nonchalant. Nonchalant.

452
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:25,559
Nonchalant.

453
00:55:26,603 --> 00:55:27,763
Get it in there.

454
00:55:30,107 --> 00:55:31,938
You are one fuckin' idiot.

455
00:56:00,137 --> 00:56:01,297
Mr. Haff?

456
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:05,703
Mr. Presley?

457
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:13,480
Now, now, Mr. Presley.

458
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:18,283
You are looking much stronger,
but you shouldn't be out here too long.

459
00:56:18,355 --> 00:56:20,118
It's time for your nap.

460
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:24,718
And it's also time for us to do
that little... you know.

461
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:26,922
You fuck off,
you patronizing bitch!

462
00:56:28,665 --> 00:56:32,658
I'm sick of your shit! I'll lube
my own crankshaft from now on.

463
00:56:35,038 --> 00:56:36,528
You treat me like a baby again,

464
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:39,268
I'll wrap this goddamn walker
right around your head!

465
00:57:13,243 --> 00:57:15,177
How in the hell
did that mummy do that?

466
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:48,341
W ell... what the hell.

467
00:58:35,025 --> 00:58:36,959
W here did old Bubba Ho-Tep go?

468
00:58:38,595 --> 00:58:40,085
W here did he come from?

469
00:58:42,032 --> 00:58:43,761
How the hell did he get here?

470
00:58:47,704 --> 00:58:49,035
W ait a minute.

471
00:59:09,492 --> 00:59:11,983
Under the bridge.
I saw him under the bridge.

472
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:47,189
Come on, mama.

473
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:20,722
It's a cancer.

474
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:25,034
They're keepin' it from me 'cause I'm old,
and to them, it don't matter.

475
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:27,763
They think age will kill me first,
and they're probably right.

476
01:00:27,837 --> 01:00:28,997
Well, suck them!

477
01:00:30,006 --> 01:00:32,065
I know what it is,
and if it isn't...

478
01:00:32,142 --> 01:00:33,473
it might as well be.

479
01:01:31,434 --> 01:01:37,430
Station KROP is proud to present
the Elvis Presley movie marathon.

480
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:45,838
It's 24 hours of Elvis
in the roles he made famous.

481
01:01:45,915 --> 01:01:50,181
Watch that two-fisted Hound Dog
out-strum, outrace,

482
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:53,586
out-fight, and outwit the bad guys.

483
01:01:54,824 --> 01:02:00,091
And at the same time,
watch the King slay the girls.

484
01:02:03,466 --> 01:02:04,865
Shitty pictures, man.

485
01:02:05,935 --> 01:02:07,266
Every single one.

486
01:02:10,306 --> 01:02:13,798
Here I was complainin' about
loss of pride and how life had treated me,

487
01:02:13,877 --> 01:02:17,313
and now I realized...
I never had any pride.

488
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,712
And much of how life
had treated me had been good.

489
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:22,115
The bulk of the bad
was my own damn fault.

490
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,853
Should've fired Colonel Parker
by the time I got in the pictures.

491
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:28,652
Old fart had been a shark and a fool,

492
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:31,057
and I was an even bigger fool
for following him.

493
01:02:32,429 --> 01:02:34,420
If only I'd treated Priscilla right.

494
01:02:35,899 --> 01:02:38,026
If I could've told
my daughter I loved her.

495
01:02:39,502 --> 01:02:42,335
Always the questions.
Never the answers.

496
01:02:42,405 --> 01:02:45,897
Always the hopes...
never the fulfillments.

497
01:02:52,849 --> 01:02:56,580
I had the woman who calls herself
my niece come get me.

498
01:02:56,653 --> 01:02:59,816
She took me downtown this morning
to the newspaper morgue.

499
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:02,357
She's been helping me
to do some research.

500
01:03:03,293 --> 01:03:06,126
- Research on what, man?
- On our mummy.

501
01:03:06,196 --> 01:03:07,857
You know somethin' about him?

502
01:03:07,931 --> 01:03:09,990
I know plenty.

503
01:03:12,402 --> 01:03:15,803
Now, one of the lesser mummies,

504
01:03:15,872 --> 01:03:18,466
on loan from the Egyptian government,

505
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:21,601
was being circulated
all over the United States.

506
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:23,236
You know, museums,
stuff like that.

507
01:03:23,313 --> 01:03:25,338
W hat do you mean?
Like King Tut or whatever?

508
01:03:25,415 --> 01:03:27,212
No, more like King Tut's brother.

509
01:03:27,283 --> 01:03:31,652
His mummy was flown or carried
by the train from state to state.

510
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:34,315
W hen it got to Texas,
it was stolen.

511
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:35,379
Stolen?

512
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:40,225
Evidence points to it being stolen at night
by a couple of guys in a silver bus.

513
01:03:40,296 --> 01:03:43,026
Bus? Hey, I've seen that!

514
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:45,329
Anyway, the thieves
broke into the museum,

515
01:03:45,401 --> 01:03:48,336
stole it in hopes of a ransom,

516
01:03:48,404 --> 01:03:53,273
when in comes the worst storm
in East Texas history.

517
01:03:54,244 --> 01:03:55,336
Let me guess.

518
01:03:56,312 --> 01:03:58,303
The bus was washed away, see?

519
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:01,544
'Cause I think I saw it today.
It was way back in the creek.

520
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:04,451
The mummy was imprisoned
by the debris.

521
01:04:05,355 --> 01:04:07,414
Look here...
how'd it come back to life?

522
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,890
And how did I end up
inside its memories?

523
01:04:09,959 --> 01:04:12,792
Speculation broadens here,
but from what I've read,

524
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:15,695
some mummies get buried
without their names...

525
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:18,063
a curse put on their sarcophagus.

526
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:22,429
Hey, now, maybe our boy's
one of them.

527
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:26,669
I mean, when he's in the coffin,
he's just a dried-up old corpse,

528
01:04:26,743 --> 01:04:29,974
but when the bus got washed away,
maybe it overturned or broke open,

529
01:04:30,046 --> 01:04:32,037
and now he's free of coffin and curse.

530
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:36,484
He's free from imprisonment,
but he still needs souls.

531
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,451
Now he's free to have them.

532
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:42,719
He can just keep on feedin'
unless he's finally destroyed.

533
01:04:45,562 --> 01:04:47,052
So, what do we do, Jack?

534
01:04:48,398 --> 01:04:51,196
Changing rest homes
might be a good idea.

535
01:04:51,267 --> 01:04:52,894
I can't think of much else.

536
01:04:52,969 --> 01:04:54,960
But I will say this...

537
01:04:55,038 --> 01:04:58,701
Our mummy is
a nighttime kind of guy.

538
01:04:58,775 --> 01:05:01,972
So, I'm gonna go and sleep now.

539
01:05:02,045 --> 01:05:04,411
I'll set my alarm
for just before dark,

540
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,108
then I can get myself
a couple of cups of coffee.

541
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:09,046
Damn straight.

542
01:05:09,118 --> 01:05:12,849
If he comes in here tonight, I don't
want him slappin' his lips on my asshole.

543
01:05:12,922 --> 01:05:15,288
Yes. Consider it.

544
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:21,025
He's got the proverbial
bird's nest on the ground here.

545
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:42,684
What do I really have
left in life but this place?

546
01:05:47,257 --> 01:05:48,986
It ain't much of a home...

547
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:51,717
but it's all I got.

548
01:05:57,066 --> 01:05:58,465
W ell, goddamnit.

549
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:04,865
I'll be damned if I let some foreign,
graffiti-writin', soul-suckin',

550
01:06:04,941 --> 01:06:08,274
son of a bitch in an oversized
cowboy hat and boots

551
01:06:08,344 --> 01:06:12,178
take my friends' souls and shit 'em
down the visitors toilet!

552
01:06:18,288 --> 01:06:21,121
In the movies,
I always played heroic types.

553
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,623
But when the stage lights went out,

554
01:06:22,692 --> 01:06:26,355
it was time for drugs and stupidity
and the coveting of women.

555
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:28,893
Now it's time.

556
01:06:28,965 --> 01:06:32,696
Time to be a little of what I
had always fantasized bein'...

557
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:34,100
a hero.

558
01:06:46,516 --> 01:06:47,574
Hello?

559
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:50,286
Mr. Kennedy?

560
01:06:50,353 --> 01:06:52,617
Ask not what your rest home
can do for you.

561
01:06:53,656 --> 01:06:56,022
Ask what you can do
for your rest home.

562
01:06:56,092 --> 01:06:59,755
Hey, you're copying my best lines.

563
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:02,093
Then let me paraphrase
one of my own.

564
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:05,023
Let's take care of business.

565
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:08,435
Just what are you
getting at, Elvis?

566
01:07:08,504 --> 01:07:10,699
I think you know
what I'm gettin' at, Mr. President.

567
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:13,731
W e're gonna kill us a mummy.

568
01:07:26,656 --> 01:07:29,056
Two bottles of rubbing alcohol.

569
01:07:30,193 --> 01:07:32,821
Check.
Don't even have to toss 'em.

570
01:07:32,895 --> 01:07:34,385
Look here.

571
01:07:34,464 --> 01:07:36,898
Found this in the storage room.

572
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:38,998
I thought they kept it locked.

573
01:07:39,068 --> 01:07:41,866
They do. I stole a hairpin
and picked the lock, baby.

574
01:07:41,938 --> 01:07:43,235
Great.

575
01:07:43,306 --> 01:07:44,398
Matches.

576
01:07:45,174 --> 01:07:47,836
Check. Even scrounged up
a cigarette lighter.

577
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:51,413
Good. Uniform.

578
01:07:56,185 --> 01:07:58,016
Big check on that, baby.

579
01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:04,620
W ell, I got a nice pair of shoes
to go with this.

580
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:05,752
Check.

581
01:08:07,797 --> 01:08:08,957
Scissors.

582
01:08:09,031 --> 01:08:10,259
Check.

583
01:08:11,467 --> 01:08:12,525
All right.

584
01:08:12,602 --> 01:08:15,969
Now, I got my chair
oiled and ready to roll.

585
01:08:16,572 --> 01:08:18,597
That's good, man.
W e could use some wheels.

586
01:08:18,674 --> 01:08:22,508
And I picked some words of power
from my book of magic.

587
01:08:22,578 --> 01:08:24,307
I don't know
if they'll stop a mummy,

588
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:26,712
but they're supposed
to ward off evil.

589
01:08:27,383 --> 01:08:30,284
I wrote them down.
One for each of us.

590
01:08:30,353 --> 01:08:32,344
W ell, we'll use what we got, baby.

591
01:08:33,222 --> 01:08:35,690
All right, 2:45 a.m.,
we hook up right back here.

592
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:40,024
No, at the rate we travel,
maybe we ought to start at 2:30.

593
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:43,890
Say, Jack?

594
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:47,663
Do we know
what the hell we're doin', man?

595
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:53,707
No. But they say
that fire cleanses evil.

596
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:57,371
Let's just hope that they...
whoever they are... is right.

597
01:08:57,447 --> 01:08:59,005
Check on that, too.

598
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:00,639
All right, synchronize watches.

599
01:09:00,716 --> 01:09:03,947
And... mark.

600
01:09:04,921 --> 01:09:09,756
Now, the twwo key words for tonight
are "caution" and "flammable."

601
01:09:09,826 --> 01:09:13,318
And also...
"watch your ass."

602
01:10:22,231 --> 01:10:24,131
W hat's that you got
hanging around your neck?

603
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:27,164
That's my medicine bag.

604
01:10:27,236 --> 01:10:29,170
Indians used to wear 'em into battle.

605
01:10:30,306 --> 01:10:32,274
Full of all kinds of lucky stuff.

606
01:10:33,409 --> 01:10:36,469
See here?
Mucho mojo.

607
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:45,580
That's my daughter.

608
01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:50,257
I know.

609
01:10:52,929 --> 01:10:56,490
W e weren't there for our kids
when they needed us, were we?

610
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:01,726
Man, if I could just talk to her again...

611
01:11:03,005 --> 01:11:04,165
tell her I love her...

612
01:11:05,608 --> 01:11:07,667
try and make things right somehow.

613
01:11:08,911 --> 01:11:10,902
No time for regrets, Elvis.

614
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:14,177
W e were the best fathers we could be
under the circumstances.

615
01:11:16,419 --> 01:11:18,580
Yeah, I guess,
no time for regrets.

616
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:21,583
W e got business to take care of.

617
01:11:21,657 --> 01:11:24,353
Look here.
Top it off with this.

618
01:11:24,427 --> 01:11:26,759
I stole it from the gardener
when he wasn't lookin'.

619
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:34,465
It's gonna be
one hell of a barbeque.

620
01:11:44,347 --> 01:11:45,746
Let's do it, amigo.

621
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:51,577
Hey, Jack?

622
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:57,183
I just got one last question.

623
01:11:59,462 --> 01:12:00,520
Marilyn.

624
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:06,031
Come on, man.
Marilyn Monroe?

625
01:12:06,936 --> 01:12:08,927
W hat was she like in the sack?

626
01:12:09,905 --> 01:12:13,068
That is classified information.
Top secret!

627
01:12:14,644 --> 01:12:16,305
But betwween you and me...

628
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,540
W ow!

629
01:12:22,818 --> 01:12:24,911
You old dog.
W atch your back, Jack.

630
01:12:30,626 --> 01:12:31,786
Gotta hump it.

631
01:13:23,079 --> 01:13:26,947
Shit... when Bubba Ho-Tep
comes out of that creek bed,

632
01:13:27,016 --> 01:13:29,075
he's gonna come out
hungry and pissed.

633
01:13:29,151 --> 01:13:31,813
When I try and stop him, he's gonna
jam this paint can up my ass

634
01:13:31,887 --> 01:13:34,219
and jam me and that wheelchair
up Jack's ass.

635
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:19,892
Shit.

636
01:14:27,777 --> 01:14:28,971
Hey, Jack.

637
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

638
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:45,550
Don't make me use
my stuff on you, baby.

639
01:16:29,131 --> 01:16:31,691
Damn!
W here did he go to?

640
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:36,267
Hey! You stay put!

641
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:38,303
I'll flush him out!

642
01:16:41,043 --> 01:16:42,635
You be careful, man.

643
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No, Jack!

644
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:25,478
Oh, man.

645
01:18:02,257 --> 01:18:05,920
Come and get it,
you undead sack of shit.

646
01:18:31,453 --> 01:18:32,613
Sorry, man.

647
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:02,710
Mr. Kennedy?

648
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:13,661
The President is soon dead.

649
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:23,900
So, now...
it's up to you, Elvis.

650
01:19:23,972 --> 01:19:26,406
You got to get him.

651
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:30,707
You... got to...

652
01:19:30,779 --> 01:19:32,610
take care of business.

653
01:19:49,531 --> 01:19:50,691
That's right, man.

654
01:19:52,501 --> 01:19:53,991
T.C. B...

655
01:19:56,271 --> 01:19:57,602
It's just you and me.

656
01:20:16,592 --> 01:20:17,752
Mr. President.

657
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:42,081
"You nasty thing
from beyond the dead...

658
01:20:43,252 --> 01:20:48,417
"No matter what you think or do,
good things will never come to you.

659
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:54,924
"And if evil
is your black design,

660
01:20:54,997 --> 01:20:59,661
"you can bet the goodness
of the Light Ones...

661
01:20:59,735 --> 01:21:02,863
will kick your bad behind"?

662
01:21:03,906 --> 01:21:05,567
For chrissake...

663
01:21:05,641 --> 01:21:06,801
That's it?

664
01:21:08,877 --> 01:21:11,778
That's the chant against evil
from the Book Of Souls?

665
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:13,109
Yeah, right, boss.

666
01:21:13,182 --> 01:21:15,673
And what kind of decoder ring
comes with that, man?

667
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:18,049
Shit, it doesn't even rhyme well!

668
01:21:45,814 --> 01:21:47,213
This is dog shit.

669
01:21:52,087 --> 01:21:54,817
It's time for A-C-T-l-O-N.

670
01:21:57,025 --> 01:21:59,186
Come on, baby.
Here we go.

671
01:23:17,539 --> 01:23:18,938
I was goin' out.

672
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:22,643
And if I did, not only would I be
one dead son of a bitch,

673
01:23:22,711 --> 01:23:23,871
but so would my soul.

674
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,711
I'd be just so much crap.

675
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:31,315
No afterlife, no reincarnation,
no angels with harps.

676
01:23:32,054 --> 01:23:34,614
Whatever lay beyond
would not be known to me.

677
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:38,020
It would all end right here
for Elvis Aaron Presley.

678
01:23:38,694 --> 01:23:40,753
Nothin' left but a quick flush.

679
01:23:44,966 --> 01:23:46,456
T.C.B., baby.

680
01:23:55,744 --> 01:23:58,872
Your soul-suckin' days
are over, amigo.

681
01:24:56,204 --> 01:24:59,605
I felt somethin' inside
gratin' against somethin' soft.

682
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:03,577
I felt like a water balloon
with a hole poked in it.

683
01:25:06,381 --> 01:25:08,542
I was goin' down for the last count.

684
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:10,811
And I knew it.

685
01:25:13,255 --> 01:25:15,086
But I still have my soul.

686
01:25:17,259 --> 01:25:18,658
It's still mine.

687
01:25:20,195 --> 01:25:21,594
All mine.

688
01:25:26,134 --> 01:25:29,399
And the folks up there
at Shady Rest...

689
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,930
they have theirs, too.

690
01:25:34,576 --> 01:25:36,066
And they're gonna keep 'em.

691
01:25:37,946 --> 01:25:39,436
Every single one.

692
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:09,370
Thank you.

693
01:26:12,147 --> 01:26:13,978
Thank you very much.
