1
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:01:00,638 --> 00:01:03,608
Hello?! Is anyone in there?

3
00:01:04,408 --> 00:01:08,311
Oh, thank God! Let me in!
Please let me in!

4
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:13,117
Sorry, lady, we just closed.

5
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:15,119
No, No! Please!

6
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:38,776
- 911, state your emergency.
- You've got to help me!

7
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:40,945
- They took them!
- Took who?

8
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:46,083
My boys! Oh, God.
We were just here, and they took them!

9
00:01:46,183 --> 00:01:49,654
Ma'am? Ma'am? I need you to calm down
and give me your location.

10
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:51,255
Can you look around
and tell me what you see?

11
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:54,458
There's a gas station, on the highway...

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the fuck?

14
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:58,420
Whoa!

15
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:27,518
- What the hell's going on?
- Well, we're not sure, boss.

16
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:30,621
This here is a... weird one.

17
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:33,424
Store clerk here said a woman,
brunette, like 30,

18
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:36,060
shows up around midnight,
she's acting irate,

19
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,597
banging on the door here
and wants to use the phone.

20
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:42,400
- And then...
- Then what?

21
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,501
I think I'll let the boy
tell you himself.

22
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:50,074
Now, sheriff, I'm not gonna lie to you,

23
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:53,971
I've done a lot of hallucinogens
in my day,

24
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:58,028
but what I saw last night,

25
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:02,186
that shit was out of this world.

26
00:04:03,387 --> 00:04:05,421
Straight up.

27
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:23,507
Nancy McPherson.

28
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,642
Where did you go?

29
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:10,948
I know, yeah, I won't forget.

30
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:14,918
In the garage. Don't worry,
I'm using a wide angle lens.

31
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,157
Never mind. Mom? Ok.

32
00:06:20,257 --> 00:06:23,360
Mom, I gotta go. I'm packing.

33
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,262
Mom, I'm getting off the phone now.
Ok. I love you, too. Bye.

34
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:33,068
- Mom busting your balls again?
- Yeah, she's driving me fucking nuts.

35
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:35,706
Are you sure you want to come with me?

36
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:37,741
I could just take the photos
and come home tonight.

37
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:40,444
No, I'm coming with you
and it's gonna be great.

38
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:43,681
It's been a brutal semester, God knows
we both deserve some R and R.

39
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:45,981
If you say so.

40
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:51,232
It's gonna be fun. We can go on a hike,

41
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:56,827
little small campfire,
look up at the stars. And then...

42
00:06:57,428 --> 00:06:59,563
I will make you my bitch.

43
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:02,566
Or I can be your bitch,
I can be your bitch, too, if you want.

44
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,737
You're already my bitch.

45
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:10,972
Dad, what do you want?

46
00:07:11,742 --> 00:07:13,844
Hey, April!

47
00:07:13,944 --> 00:07:17,348
- You actually see me over there?
- Hey, dad. Yeah, I can see you.

48
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:20,117
I can't talk for long, ok?
We're just getting ready to leave.

49
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:23,854
I still can't believe your mother's
making you go all the way out there.

50
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:28,158
Couldn't she just have gotten the real estate
agent to take the damn photos?

51
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:30,728
I don't know, she said it was gonna
cost too much. You know mom.

52
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:36,333
Cheapest woman I ever met. She's just
selling it to spite me, you know that right?

53
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,536
As if getting the goddamn house
wasn't enough.

54
00:07:39,636 --> 00:07:42,573
Dad, are you drinking?
It's like eleven in the morning.

55
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:48,045
You know what they say, the only cure
for a hangover is to keep it coming.

56
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:52,449
Dad, seriously. Slow down.
I worry about you.

57
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:55,119
Did you catch the game last night?

58
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:58,555
Dad, I really can't talk for long,
we're, like, almost out the door.

59
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:00,558
Well, wait, wait. I...

60
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:03,660
I need you to grab some things
for me while you're out there.

61
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:08,032
Two fishing rods in the garage,
and a tackle box.

62
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:10,134
You'll find it behind the work bench.

63
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:13,455
Ok, fishing rods, tackle box. Got it.

64
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:18,876
Oh... and my shotgun. The double barrel.
It's in the basement.

65
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:23,447
If your mother wants that, she's gonna have
to pry it out of my cold, dead hands.

66
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:28,052
Got it. One shotgun, dead hands.
Ok, dad, I'm gonna go now, ok?

67
00:08:28,152 --> 00:08:30,421
I love you, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

68
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:33,390
Ok, how do I turn off...

69
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,760
I feel like I'm seventeen
all over again.

70
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,563
Did your dad find a new job yet?

71
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:43,667
He's been looking,
but he's not in very good shape.

72
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:47,605
Jesus, what now?

73
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:49,974
- Hello?
- Yo, bitch!

74
00:08:50,074 --> 00:08:52,375
Are we doing this shit, or what?

75
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:56,580
- We'll be down in a sec, chill.
- Well, it's hot as fuck down here, Kyle,

76
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,516
my balls are sweating
like a motherfucker. Let's go!

77
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:01,051
Who is that, is that Seth?

78
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:03,187
Ok, I probably should have
told you this earlier,

79
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:08,758
but I might have invited a few people
to come with us to the cabin.

80
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:13,161
- Kyle, seriously?
- April!

81
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:18,001
- Hey, Mel.
- Come on, April, let's do this shit!

82
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:22,270
Time is money.
I got places to go, people to see.

83
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:27,678
It's gonna be fun, I promise.

84
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:32,815
Oh, yeah, hey April, can I come upstairs
real quick? I gotta take a fat shit.

85
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:35,352
I so hate you right now.

86
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:54,571
- Come on, come on!
- Seth, watch it!

87
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:57,572
Watch this shit!

88
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,019
Motherfucker!

89
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:03,447
Don't fucking do that again.

90
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:06,817
Don't be such a fuckin' pussy, man.
There's nobody on the road!

91
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:11,552
- Oh, fuck.
- If he searches us, we're fucked.

92
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:25,553
I gotta tell you,

93
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:29,573
that is pretty high on the list of
stupidest things I've ever seen in my life.

94
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:32,676
Yeah, I'm really sorry,
officer. I'm an idiot.

95
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:36,079
I'm glad you're aware of it.
License and registration.

96
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,997
Yeah...

97
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:40,884
Where you kids headed?

98
00:10:40,984 --> 00:10:44,021
My mom owns a cabin out here.
We're just staying at it for the weekend.

99
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:48,025
Well, we've had some
disturbances around here...

100
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,228
some break-ins, vandalism,
animals being killed.

101
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:54,097
Obviously, you kids wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

102
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:56,066
No, nothing. We just got here.

103
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,802
- You're just visiting.
- Yes.

104
00:10:58,902 --> 00:11:03,307
See, we get a lot of that. Kids coming down
for the weekend, getting drunk,

105
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:07,311
thinking they can do whatever they want.
I'm here to tell you that's not the case.

106
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:09,646
While you're in my town you best behave,

107
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:12,082
or you're gonna have to deal
with me and you don't want to do that.

108
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:15,351
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir.

109
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:18,655
- I'm gonna give you a warning.
- Thank you.

110
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:22,293
No more fuckin' around. Got it?

111
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:25,527
Yes, thank you.
We're not gonna be a problem.

112
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:29,764
Yep.

113
00:11:30,701 --> 00:11:33,068
Remind me to punch you
in the dick, Seth.

114
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:46,283
Wow, this is amazing!

115
00:11:46,383 --> 00:11:48,552
It's beautiful out here.

116
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:50,830
Yeah, April,
when you said cabin in the woods

117
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,922
I thought this
was gonna be a total shithole.

118
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:08,705
Oh, yeah! Fuckin' A!

119
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:11,472
This is what I'm talkin' about!

120
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:14,642
This is such a trip.

121
00:12:15,712 --> 00:12:19,015
Last time I was here,
we were in middle school.

122
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:21,257
Yeah.

123
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,223
We used to come out here every summer.

124
00:12:26,023 --> 00:12:28,169
I'm gonna go grab my camera,
hopefully I can get all the rooms

125
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:30,060
- before it gets dark out.
- Do you need any help?

126
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,062
- No, it's ok baby, I got it.
- Alright.

127
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:34,102
Hey, think fast, fuckhead!

128
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:38,766
Bottoms up, motherfuckers!

129
00:13:11,468 --> 00:13:14,137
I figured it was coyotes,
so I replaced the whole damn fence.

130
00:13:14,237 --> 00:13:16,773
Now I don't know what to think.

131
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:19,122
Well...

132
00:13:20,444 --> 00:13:25,315
it doesn't look like coyotes, Rick.
It's too perfect, too clean.

133
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:27,784
If this keeps up,
I'm not gonna survive the season.

134
00:13:27,884 --> 00:13:33,556
I'm gonna get animal control down here,
get things cleared up, ok? You take care.

135
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:46,182
I'm over here at the Riseman farm,
got another animal mutilation

136
00:13:46,282 --> 00:13:49,938
- same as the others.
- Copy that, sheriff.

137
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:03,685
What the hell is going on in this town?

138
00:14:04,354 --> 00:14:05,505
- No.
- Yeah.

139
00:14:05,605 --> 00:14:07,157
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you slept with that guy.

140
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:08,225
- Yeah.
- No!

141
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:11,094
- Yeah!
- He was, like, forty and so guido!

142
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:15,599
Oh, whatever. He was hot.

143
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,402
So...

144
00:14:18,502 --> 00:14:22,005
NYU probably has a pretty
good writing program.

145
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:25,575
You know, it would probably
be easy to transfer there.

146
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:27,266
- What?
- For Kyle.

147
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,211
If he wanted to go with you.

148
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:32,816
Melanie, I put a lot of thought into this, ok?
I just don't see it happening.

149
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:37,558
I don't know, it's just that there are
a lot of douchebag guys out there,

150
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:39,756
and Kyle isn't one of them.

151
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:43,159
- You guys are great together.
- I know we are, I just...

152
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:45,747
I don't want to be one of those girls
that marries her high school sweetheart

153
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:48,532
and then pops out three kids
and wonders what could have been.

154
00:14:48,632 --> 00:14:51,034
Look, all I'm saying is that, you know,

155
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:53,971
maybe you should just think
about it a little bit more.

156
00:14:56,807 --> 00:15:01,511
What? What is it? What the fuck?
What the fuck's your problem?

157
00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:04,281
Rusty, stop being so aggro.

158
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:07,451
Fucking... Rusty, come back here!

159
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:10,353
- Rusty!
- Fucking dumb dog.

160
00:15:10,453 --> 00:15:12,320
Rusty!

161
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:25,535
Fuck. I think he's back there.

162
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:28,005
Rusty!

163
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:30,438
Rusty!

164
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:38,880
Really, Mel?

165
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:45,153
Don't be a square. Come on.

166
00:15:54,497 --> 00:15:58,702
Wow. What a shithole.

167
00:16:00,003 --> 00:16:02,639
Fuck, I think he's back there.

168
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:11,446
Holy shit, Melanie, look.

169
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,586
Oh, my God.

170
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:18,653
Score!

171
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:27,697
Thank you, God, thank you, God.

172
00:16:27,997 --> 00:16:30,467
Ok, remember,
we're here to find the dog.

173
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,767
What dog?

174
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:38,152
Oh.

175
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,850
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle!

176
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,752
Melanie, put it down.
Come on. This is sketch.

177
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:50,854
It's probably some drug dealer's stash.

178
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:54,989
- Can I just take one bag?
- No! I don't wanna get killed!

179
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Ok, fine. Fine.
There you are! Don't do that again.
Come on, let's go ok? Oh, my God!

180
00:17:07,203 --> 00:17:09,356
What are you doing on my property?

181
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:11,041
We weren't trying
to steal anything, I promise!

182
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:12,342
You're trespassing!

183
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:15,278
No, no, no, my dog just ran back here
and we came back to get him!

184
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:18,381
Who sent you? Who sent you?

185
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:21,182
My parents own a cabin
right down the road!

186
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:26,573
April?

187
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:30,627
I know you?

188
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:34,929
Hell, I haven't seen you since you
were knee high to a bait pail.

189
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:40,270
Remember? Your dad and I
used to take you fishing out on the lake!

190
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,505
- Travis?
- Yeah!

191
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:55,952
Sorry for spookin' you guys back there,
I don't get many visitors.

192
00:17:56,252 --> 00:18:01,622
I see somebody on my property,
they're usually here lookin' for trouble.

193
00:18:04,094 --> 00:18:05,762
Is this you?

194
00:18:06,863 --> 00:18:11,300
Oh, yeah, a little green
behind the ears in that one.

195
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:15,972
So... were you in, like,
Vietnam or whatever?

196
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:21,811
'67 through '71.

197
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:23,680
Brave as shit.

198
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,208
I've seen things...

199
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:30,988
things your generation
just wouldn't understand.

200
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:33,924
Hey, what's that thing?

201
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:42,032
My motion activated thermal cameras
picked this one up last week.

202
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:43,934
What is it?

203
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:46,436
What do you think it is?
Secret military air craft!

204
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:50,774
They've been using this whole area for test
flying ever since the end of the Cold War.

205
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:52,876
Maybe things have been heating up.

206
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:57,703
Just last night I tracked one of these babies
going about 2400 clicks an hour,

207
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:02,852
it stopped right on a goddamn dime, did a 180
quicker than any aircraft known to man.

208
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:04,487
You had to see it.

209
00:19:04,587 --> 00:19:07,422
- No way!
- Way.

210
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,875
Oh, you guys are so young,

211
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:15,565
you have no idea
what's going on out there.

212
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:18,034
Why should you?

213
00:19:18,835 --> 00:19:20,904
When I was your age,

214
00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:26,142
I thought the world was...
a good and fair place.

215
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:29,410
I've seen some shit since then.

216
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:34,865
People nowadays live in their naive,
comfortable bubble worlds,

217
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,154
and the men behind the curtain
want to keep them that way.

218
00:19:38,254 --> 00:19:42,957
The last thing they want is an informed,
public cable free-thought.

219
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:46,596
Free. Yeah.

220
00:19:46,696 --> 00:19:50,266
People out there, they think they're free,
but they couldn't be further from the truth.

221
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:54,936
That's why you gotta stay off the radar.
Keep off the grid.

222
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:04,683
'Cause they're out there,
and they're watching.

223
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:10,518
So... can I buy some weed?

224
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:16,092
Of course you can.

225
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:18,997
So then, I was like "oh, my god."

226
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:22,233
And I was, like, freaking out and I felt
super dizzy and out of it, and I mean,

227
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,435
I was having a full on panic attack
in the middle of the club!

228
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:28,605
All of my friends were totally TTYL,
I didn't know what to do.

229
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:34,010
So anyway, out of nowhere, he comes over
and he's all like "hey, are you alright"?

230
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,715
He takes me to his dorm and he takes care
of me all night and he gives me water

231
00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:41,184
and I just knew he was
the right guy for me.

232
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:44,385
So yeah, that's how we met.

233
00:20:46,256 --> 00:20:51,292
- Wow, that sounds amazing.
- I know, right?

234
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:55,131
Hey... can I talk to you for a second?

235
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:59,934
- Just, like, upstairs?
- Yeah, ok, sure.

236
00:21:10,446 --> 00:21:12,713
Actually, could you close the door?

237
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:16,720
- Are you ok? You're acting really weird.
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

238
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:19,754
So, I...

239
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:25,628
I don't know how to say this, really.

240
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:27,728
Say what?

241
00:21:31,134 --> 00:21:33,703
You know that I care about you
a lot, right?

242
00:21:34,003 --> 00:21:37,473
Yeah, of course I do. What is it?

243
00:21:38,074 --> 00:21:40,326
Ok, here goes.

244
00:21:41,944 --> 00:21:44,052
April...

245
00:21:44,454 --> 00:21:47,484
we know each other inside and out,

246
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:51,221
and the last three years have been
the best three years of my life.

247
00:21:51,321 --> 00:21:55,356
I love waking up next to you, and...

248
00:21:55,456 --> 00:21:59,362
and I want to keep waking up
next to you for the rest of my life.

249
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:01,097
So...

250
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:05,234
What are you doing, Kyle?

251
00:22:05,635 --> 00:22:08,638
April, what do you say?

252
00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:11,275
You want to keep waking up
next to me, too?

253
00:22:13,276 --> 00:22:15,945
Kyle, are you serious?

254
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:17,914
Is that a yes?

255
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:21,785
I don't know.

256
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:24,854
You don't know?

257
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:27,888
Oh, fuck.

258
00:22:32,862 --> 00:22:35,455
You can't leave me hanging here.

259
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,175
Kyle, I...

260
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:48,899
- I can't.
- But why?

261
00:22:49,712 --> 00:22:53,214
Fuck, I haven't told you this yet. I...

262
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:55,852
I didn't want it to be like this.

263
00:22:56,152 --> 00:23:00,056
- I got a job offer in New York.
- New York?

264
00:23:00,156 --> 00:23:02,960
- Yeah.
- When does it start?

265
00:23:05,061 --> 00:23:07,363
The middle of May.

266
00:23:08,164 --> 00:23:11,067
That's like a month away!
When the hell were you gonna tell me this?

267
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:15,238
This weekend, but then you ended up
inviting a bunch of people over here.

268
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:19,641
That's right in the middle of the semester,
I can't transfer that quickly.

269
00:23:22,812 --> 00:23:24,214
What, did you not want me
to go with you?

270
00:23:24,314 --> 00:23:26,938
No, Kyle, I didn't say that.
I just... I...

271
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:29,915
Oh, my God. You're breaking up with me.

272
00:23:30,015 --> 00:23:32,889
No, no Kyle, I just...

273
00:23:32,989 --> 00:23:36,857
I don't know if I'm ever gonna get another
opportunity like this again.

274
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:41,130
- Oh, I'm such an idiot.
- No, Kyle.

275
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,532
- I'm such a fucking idiot.
- Kyle...

276
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:48,836
Kyle, don't walk away.

277
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:52,208
Surprise!

278
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:54,210
Let's get this motherfucking
party start...

279
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,644
Fuck off, Seth.

280
00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:02,116
- You said no?
- Seth!

281
00:24:04,554 --> 00:24:07,821
That is some cold ass shit.

282
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:57,173
Welcome to the gayest
surprise party ever!

283
00:24:57,673 --> 00:25:00,023
Not only did the surprise
completely backfire,

284
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,512
but there's no TV,
there's no cell phone service,

285
00:25:03,612 --> 00:25:08,284
and I just got the worst news
that my chick is on the rag.

286
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:10,253
In this corner we have Kyle,

287
00:25:10,353 --> 00:25:14,157
who has just taken a merciless beating
from April and could be out for the count.

288
00:25:14,257 --> 00:25:17,890
Hey! Say something
for the camera there, champ!

289
00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:21,931
Come here, you fuckin' dumb dog.

290
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:24,400
Oh, yeah, gimme this shit.

291
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:27,471
What are these dirty sluts up to?

292
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:31,674
Fuck, I just wish it didn't have to go down
like that. I fucking care about him.

293
00:25:31,774 --> 00:25:32,675
Are you filming this?

294
00:25:32,775 --> 00:25:36,869
That is some fucked up shit. I mean really,
who says no to a guy on one knee?

295
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,353
Seth, fuck off.

296
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,450
I just, I'm trying to understand
the situation.

297
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,485
- So am I.
- Seth.

298
00:25:42,585 --> 00:25:44,755
I thought we were happy together.

299
00:25:44,855 --> 00:25:49,525
It's "April and Kyle", remember? We're in it
for the long haul. Where you go, I go.

300
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,894
- He fuckin' loves you, April.
- Enough.

301
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:54,130
Seth, get the fuck out of here.

302
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,133
- I care about you, but...
- But what? But what?

303
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:59,068
I fucking love you and you love me.

304
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:02,338
I don't even think I believe
in the concept of marriage, Kyle.

305
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:05,975
Look how well it turned out for my parents,
they can't stand each other!

306
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:07,343
But you are the one for me.

307
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:09,512
Kyle, that is just something
we are raised to believe

308
00:26:09,612 --> 00:26:13,049
that we're supposed to want, ok?
The one, you know?

309
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:16,352
Like it's some magical fucking thing
that is going to complete us and it's crap!

310
00:26:16,452 --> 00:26:19,155
- Are you listening to me?
- What are you talking about?

311
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:23,226
I'm saying that at the end of the day,
we're all just alone in the universe.

312
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:26,662
April, that is the worst
fucking logic...

313
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:28,477
What the fuck is that?

314
00:26:37,507 --> 00:26:38,807
What the fuck?

315
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,211
Holy fuck!

316
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,745
Oh, my God!

317
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:50,319
- We gotta go!
- Leave this shit! Let's go!

318
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:51,421
No way, man!

319
00:26:51,521 --> 00:26:54,590
- What the fuck, April?
- Melanie!

320
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,989
Shit!

321
00:26:57,827 --> 00:26:59,929
What the hell is that?

322
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:03,332
Are we really fucking doing this shit?

323
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:10,539
Fuck sakes man, I'm too fucking drunk
for this shit, man.

324
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,975
Come on, hurry the fuck up.

325
00:27:13,075 --> 00:27:14,775
Fuck.

326
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,981
Oh, my God.

327
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:23,285
- What the hell is that?
- It's an airplane, right?

328
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:26,622
I don't know, maybe man,
but what's with the red light?

329
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:29,590
- I don't fuckin' know, man.
- Seth!

330
00:27:39,702 --> 00:27:42,470
Is that what I think it is?

331
00:27:50,713 --> 00:27:54,182
Oh, my God, this is fucked up!

332
00:27:55,418 --> 00:27:57,554
What is this?

333
00:27:58,855 --> 00:28:03,958
I know one thing for sure it's not,
this is definitely not an airplane!

334
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,915
No way.

335
00:28:22,478 --> 00:28:24,781
This is so light, it's like tinfoil.

336
00:28:25,781 --> 00:28:29,252
Do you think it's a military thing
like Travis was saying?

337
00:28:29,952 --> 00:28:33,823
- It has to be.
- Ok, seriously, fuck this!

338
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:36,859
This is not fucking happening!
I'm going back to the car.

339
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:39,914
Yeah, yeah, yeah baby,
I'm with you. Yo, yo guys, let's go.

340
00:28:41,697 --> 00:28:43,074
Come on, let's go!

341
00:28:43,174 --> 00:28:46,467
Seth? Look at this!

342
00:28:53,743 --> 00:28:57,011
Yo, yo, yo! Come check this out!

343
00:29:00,182 --> 00:29:02,115
Get over here!

344
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,853
Come on.

345
00:29:08,758 --> 00:29:10,291
Holy shit.

346
00:29:20,736 --> 00:29:22,632
Are those footprints?

347
00:29:48,064 --> 00:29:49,897
Seriously?

348
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:54,434
Fuck.

349
00:29:55,738 --> 00:29:58,339
Hey, you got the video?
I want to see the video.

350
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,679
I know one thing for sure it's not,

351
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,816
- this is definitely not an airplane!
- This is so fucked!

352
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:12,288
I knew this shit was real, man.
That fuckin' Roswell Area 51 shit is true.

353
00:30:12,388 --> 00:30:14,624
- No, it's gotta be something else.
- Look at it, for Christ's sake!

354
00:30:14,724 --> 00:30:17,226
It's a UFO! It's a fucking crashed UFO!

355
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:20,296
I think we should pack our shit
and get the hell out of here, you guys.

356
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:22,765
Let's just drive until we get reception
and then call someone.

357
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:25,501
Who the fuck are we gonna call? 911?
They'll think it's a fucking joke.

358
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:30,638
- I don't know, but we can't just stay here!
- You guys! She's right.

359
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,230
Those footprints...

360
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
they were headed in this direction.
Alright, calm down.
Everything is gonna be fine.

361
00:30:44,954 --> 00:30:47,023
You've got to be kidding me!

362
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:56,365
Ok, guys, it's ok. The power's gone out here
before when the weather was this bad.

363
00:30:56,465 --> 00:31:00,000
- It's probably just the breaker.
- Well, where's the breaker?

364
00:31:17,386 --> 00:31:19,954
Come on, hurry the fuck up.

365
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:27,825
- Alright, where is it?
- It's over there.

366
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Where?
- Here.
I think it's the ground line.

367
00:31:36,403 --> 00:31:37,540
Are you ok?!

368
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,008
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, my God.

369
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:47,714
Oh, shit.

370
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:58,358
What the fuck is he barking at?

371
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

372
00:32:08,571 --> 00:32:11,774
There's someone in the house!

373
00:32:12,074 --> 00:32:15,044
Yeah, or something.

374
00:32:15,144 --> 00:32:19,013
There's a gun. There's a gun down here.

375
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:27,854
It's unloaded.

376
00:32:29,058 --> 00:32:31,257
Oh, my God, let me do it.

377
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:36,665
Where did you learn how to do that?

378
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:38,935
My dad and I used to hunt.

379
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:49,540
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Rusty!

380
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,459
Come on.

381
00:33:16,906 --> 00:33:18,727
Oh, my God.

382
00:33:19,842 --> 00:33:21,737
Quick, shut it!

383
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:32,521
Do you see anything?

384
00:33:32,621 --> 00:33:34,121
No.

385
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:39,092
Is it still in the house?

386
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,877
Oh, shit.

387
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:04,784
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

388
00:34:08,223 --> 00:34:10,190
Anything up there?

389
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:18,465
Come on.

390
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
You see anything out there?
No. Whatever was in here,
it's definitely gone now.

391
00:35:09,918 --> 00:35:11,919
Oh, my God.

392
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:15,758
Hello?

393
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,561
Did I just hear a gunshot?

394
00:35:37,112 --> 00:35:38,632
Is that blood?

395
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:45,385
What the fuck is that?

396
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:59,134
Jesus.

397
00:35:59,234 --> 00:36:03,460
Dude, that's a dead fuckin' alien.

398
00:36:10,312 --> 00:36:12,588
Kyle, it's cold! Drive faster!

399
00:36:12,688 --> 00:36:15,083
Do you guys realize what we just saw?

400
00:36:16,184 --> 00:36:18,120
I mean, do you realize what this means?

401
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,955
I don't care, I don't care.
I just wanna get home.

402
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:22,424
No, no, no, we gotta come back
in the morning and take pictures!

403
00:36:22,524 --> 00:36:25,994
- Oh, my God, are you fucking kidding me?
- Think about it! We're gonna be rich!

404
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:30,457
We're gonna be on TV and shit! We have
proof that life on another planet exists.

405
00:36:30,557 --> 00:36:33,500
Give it a rest, babe. Fuck!

406
00:36:40,642 --> 00:36:42,475
Kyle, slow down.

407
00:36:55,157 --> 00:36:57,126
Great. Perfect.

408
00:36:57,226 --> 00:37:00,596
- Just drive over it, man.
- It's too big to drive over.

409
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:02,664
Can't you just, like,
move it or something?

410
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:07,367
Move it? Look at it.
This thing probably weighs two tons.

411
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:18,748
Kyle, look at this!

412
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:28,981
What did this?

413
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:31,442
Was it lightning?

414
00:37:33,929 --> 00:37:39,466
This is the only road back into town.
What're we gonna do?

415
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:43,637
Well, at least it stopped raining.

416
00:38:15,938 --> 00:38:17,769
What the hell?

417
00:38:22,545 --> 00:38:24,276
Oh, my God!

418
00:38:27,216 --> 00:38:29,074
Jesus Christ, what the fuck is that?

419
00:38:30,252 --> 00:38:32,421
Get in the car!

420
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,741
I'm getting the fuck out of here!

421
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:53,874
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Get back in the car!

422
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:58,305
What is she doing? Let's go!

423
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,965
Oh, my God!

424
00:39:25,874 --> 00:39:28,077
Get in the fucking car!

425
00:39:39,354 --> 00:39:41,988
Oh, my God, no!

426
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

427
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:09,482
Oh, my God, no!

428
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:46,586
Sheriff's department. Open up!

429
00:40:49,591 --> 00:40:51,458
Hello?

430
00:41:24,259 --> 00:41:28,830
We're finally here, at Echo Lake,
it is unbelievably gorgeous,

431
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,632
and it's Matty's first time fishing.

432
00:41:30,832 --> 00:41:34,069
One, two, three, go!

433
00:41:34,169 --> 00:41:36,841
I'm gonna catch a fish
that's even bigger than this!

434
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:40,139
- Say hi to grandma!
- Hi, grandma!

435
00:41:44,947 --> 00:41:48,541
Live it up, I want to live that dream...

436
00:41:49,651 --> 00:41:52,788
- Oh, my God, what is that?
- Are you filming this?

437
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Honey, is that a plane?
Matty, what are you doing?
Get back in the camper!
Mom, I can see something up there.

438
00:42:01,129 --> 00:42:03,734
- Oh, my God, Matty!
- Jesus! Matty!

439
00:42:11,106 --> 00:42:12,943
Oh, God.

440
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:25,451
Anybody there?

441
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

442
00:42:53,548 --> 00:42:55,115
Don't hurt me!

443
00:42:56,218 --> 00:42:59,722
Ma'am, I am not going to hurt you.

444
00:43:00,422 --> 00:43:02,925
I'm here to protect you.

445
00:43:03,325 --> 00:43:09,264
8732, I'm over here at Dudney Trunk,
I am requesting immediate medical assistance.

446
00:43:09,364 --> 00:43:11,533
10-4 sheriff, we're on our way.

447
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:15,771
Ma'am, what happened?
Who did this to you?

448
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:20,642
They took Jeffrey! They took my Matty!

449
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:24,781
Took them where? Who took them?

450
00:43:27,182 --> 00:43:29,151
Who do you think?

451
00:43:35,123 --> 00:43:38,460
They do tests, experiments.

452
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,263
They want to know everything about us.

453
00:43:42,564 --> 00:43:44,433
They'll show you things.

454
00:43:44,533 --> 00:43:47,937
Put things in your mind.
Terrible things.

455
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:51,840
Ma'am. You're safe now.

456
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:54,937
They held me down!

457
00:43:58,513 --> 00:44:00,727
I couldn't stop them.

458
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:04,419
They held me down.

459
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:06,553
Oh, God.

460
00:44:26,808 --> 00:44:29,844
Oh, shit. What the fuck?

461
00:44:29,944 --> 00:44:32,581
What the fuck is happening?
What the fuck was that?

462
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:35,016
They just fucking took her, man!

463
00:44:35,116 --> 00:44:37,719
They just fucking took her!
We are fucking here!

464
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:39,588
- We're in the middle of fucking nowhere...
- Seth, calm down.

465
00:44:39,688 --> 00:44:41,456
Don't! Just don't touch me, ok?

466
00:44:41,556 --> 00:44:44,226
- I said get the fuck off me!
- What the hell is your problem?

467
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:48,763
Guys, guys, guys! Stop! Look!

468
00:44:48,863 --> 00:44:51,333
It's Travis's place.

469
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on. Let's go.
- Yo, you sure this guy's cool?
- Yeah, he's totally on the level.

470
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,544
Nobody move! Or this one will be dead
before he hits the floor!

471
00:45:02,644 --> 00:45:05,450
Travis, please don't hurt him!
It's just me!

472
00:45:06,147 --> 00:45:07,916
April?

473
00:45:08,516 --> 00:45:11,753
What the hell are you doing,
sneaking up on me?!

474
00:45:12,153 --> 00:45:14,689
We thought you were dead!

475
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:18,767
No, no. I've been sleeping
with one eye open for years.

476
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:21,096
Yeah? You want to let go
of me then, please!

477
00:45:21,196 --> 00:45:23,532
Oh, I'm sorry, son.

478
00:45:23,832 --> 00:45:25,630
Old habits die hard.

479
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:32,947
I was watching the dolphins
and niner's Super Bowl game and...

480
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:35,811
must have dozed off.

481
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:39,681
We didn't mean to scare you, we just...

482
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:42,350
didn't know where else to go.

483
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,951
We're in trouble and need help.

484
00:45:46,988 --> 00:45:48,762
Trouble?

485
00:45:50,725 --> 00:45:53,160
Seth, show him the video.

486
00:45:54,996 --> 00:45:56,699
Video?

487
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,689
What video?

488
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:03,571
You're gonna want to add this one
to your collection.

489
00:46:03,671 --> 00:46:06,972
This is definitely not an airplane!

490
00:46:13,214 --> 00:46:15,116
Aliens.

491
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:17,920
I should have known.

492
00:46:19,754 --> 00:46:24,110
See, everyone within the inner circle
knows that the US government

493
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,249
has had a treaty with the extraterrestrials
after since Roswell.

494
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:32,534
We don't have time
for this conspiracy theory bullshit!

495
00:46:32,634 --> 00:46:34,436
We need to get help! Now!

496
00:46:34,536 --> 00:46:38,038
Seth! Let him talk.

497
00:46:43,712 --> 00:46:46,312
What kind of treaty?

498
00:46:47,481 --> 00:46:48,883
Well...

499
00:46:49,183 --> 00:46:51,643
The powers that be
turn a blind eye to them

500
00:46:51,743 --> 00:46:55,256
abducting civilians and doing
whatever the hell it is they do with them.

501
00:46:55,356 --> 00:47:00,128
And, in turn, we get to run around
down here as if we own the place.

502
00:47:00,528 --> 00:47:03,932
It's a basic simple agreement
with one cardinal rule:

503
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:07,002
Do not engage. And you...

504
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:10,138
you engaged.

505
00:47:10,238 --> 00:47:12,474
What do you mean?

506
00:47:13,775 --> 00:47:15,877
Sweetheart, you shot one of them.

507
00:47:15,977 --> 00:47:19,115
Broke the treaty.
Now they're out for blood.

508
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:21,816
You guys, what does this mean?

509
00:47:39,968 --> 00:47:41,734
It's them.

510
00:47:51,012 --> 00:47:54,477
It's gone, right? Did it fly over us?

511
00:47:54,577 --> 00:47:56,518
- No, they landed.
- What?

512
00:47:56,718 --> 00:47:59,585
Landed, what do you mean landed, man?

513
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:09,561
Oh, my God.

514
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,200
It's time to move.

515
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,208
Where are we going?

516
00:48:20,308 --> 00:48:22,844
If you guys go that way,
you'll find a path back to your place.

517
00:48:22,944 --> 00:48:25,414
Wait, aren't you coming with us?

518
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:28,950
Look, nobody invades my property
without expecting a fight.

519
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,074
I'm American. It's my right to defend
what's mine, and nobody,

520
00:48:32,174 --> 00:48:35,357
not even little green men,
are gonna take that right away from me.

521
00:48:36,057 --> 00:48:39,159
Now you go, go on. Go on.

522
00:48:46,868 --> 00:48:48,918
Come and kiss my ass.

523
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:04,384
What the hell?

524
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Where are you, you son of a bitch?

525
00:49:33,514 --> 00:49:35,081
Shit.

526
00:50:02,877 --> 00:50:06,293
So we want to play hide and seek, do we?

527
00:50:11,052 --> 00:50:14,534
Yeah. Yeah.

528
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

529
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:06,945
Got you.

530
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Time to get your friends.

531
00:51:20,621 --> 00:51:24,493
- You have to help the others.
- What do you mean?

532
00:51:26,194 --> 00:51:30,965
They bring most people back.
Like they did with me.

533
00:51:31,265 --> 00:51:33,401
But not everyone.

534
00:51:33,701 --> 00:51:37,873
There's hundreds of people
still alive up there.

535
00:51:38,573 --> 00:51:41,643
Some of them
have been up there for years.

536
00:51:41,743 --> 00:51:44,646
Maybe even their whole lives.

537
00:51:46,147 --> 00:51:48,826
You've gotta do something.

538
00:52:19,781 --> 00:52:22,014
It can't be.

539
00:53:09,697 --> 00:53:11,966
I hope the boards hold.

540
00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:14,400
I think we're gonna be alright.

541
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

542
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,380
What was that?

543
00:53:31,853 --> 00:53:34,320
Ok, whoa, whoa, whoa.

544
00:53:37,825 --> 00:53:39,512
- What do you see?
- I can't see anything.

545
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:41,996
- What?
- I'm telling you, I can't see shit.

546
00:53:42,296 --> 00:53:44,329
Move, let me see.

547
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

548
00:53:53,595 --> 00:53:55,109
What? What? What is it?

549
00:53:55,209 --> 00:53:57,342
Oh, my God, it's right outside the door!

550
00:53:59,647 --> 00:54:01,387
It's going to get inside!

551
00:54:07,255 --> 00:54:09,455
Oh, my God, they're coming!

552
00:54:22,336 --> 00:54:26,340
Down! Get down!
Get on your knees! Get down!

553
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,109
- Don't shoot!
- Put it down!

554
00:54:28,209 --> 00:54:29,877
Do it now! Back up!

555
00:54:29,977 --> 00:54:31,679
- Officer, we need your help!
- Back up!

556
00:54:31,779 --> 00:54:35,183
- Shut up, both of you!
- Hands against the wall! Now!

557
00:54:35,283 --> 00:54:39,597
You need to help us! We didn't do anything,
alright? This is fucking bullshit!

558
00:54:39,697 --> 00:54:44,525
This one's breath smells like whiskey,
sheriff, and he's belligerent!

559
00:54:45,226 --> 00:54:49,689
You, face me. We found your car
abandoned on the side of the road,

560
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:51,801
do you mind telling me what the hell
is going on and why your friend

561
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:53,901
- just tried to kill us?
- We were attacked.

562
00:54:54,001 --> 00:54:57,205
- We are not safe here!
- Quiet! He isn't talkin' to you!

563
00:54:57,305 --> 00:54:59,674
Cool it, Mitchell.

564
00:55:01,275 --> 00:55:04,445
You said you were attacked.
What happened?

565
00:55:04,945 --> 00:55:08,115
Look, I know that this is
gonna sound crazy, ok,

566
00:55:08,215 --> 00:55:12,989
but we saw something crash in the woods.
We thought it was a plane,

567
00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:16,224
but it was, like,
this disc shaped craft...

568
00:55:16,324 --> 00:55:18,226
It took our fucking friend.

569
00:55:18,326 --> 00:55:20,261
It was a UFO!

570
00:55:20,561 --> 00:55:23,145
I mean... it abducted our friend!

571
00:55:23,245 --> 00:55:26,283
- And it was a fucking UFO!
- She's telling you the truth, I swear!

572
00:55:26,383 --> 00:55:30,838
Listen to me for a second, listen to me.
There are fucking aliens everywhere, man!

573
00:55:30,938 --> 00:55:33,508
It was right outside the cabin,
we thought you were one of them!

574
00:55:33,608 --> 00:55:35,725
Why do you think I shot at you,
you dumb pig?

575
00:55:35,825 --> 00:55:37,311
Why do you think
we boarded up all the windows...

576
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:39,413
Put your hands against the wall!

577
00:55:40,611 --> 00:55:43,284
Come on! Aliens? UFOs?

578
00:55:43,384 --> 00:55:47,722
Are you fucking listening to this shit,
sheriff? I mean, take a look around.

579
00:55:47,822 --> 00:55:51,058
There's booze and narcotics everywhere!

580
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:54,469
You cannot possibly believe
this load of shit.

581
00:55:54,569 --> 00:55:58,570
Sheriff, I bet we search the basement,
we'll find us a full-on meth lab,

582
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:02,203
- won't we, you little shit?
- We can prove it!

583
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,771
One of them was in the house.

584
00:56:03,871 --> 00:56:07,306
I shot it. It's in the pool.

585
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:12,628
Show me. Both of you.

586
00:56:12,728 --> 00:56:15,881
- You stay put. Go on.
- Ok.

587
00:56:17,018 --> 00:56:18,217
Get up, kid.

588
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:30,363
Oh, my God. It was right here, I swear.

589
00:56:32,796 --> 00:56:34,728
It wasn't dead.

590
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:43,311
You guys have another friend
hiding back there?

591
00:56:43,711 --> 00:56:47,548
No. It's just us. I swear.

592
00:56:47,648 --> 00:56:50,283
Get back in the house. Now.

593
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:04,973
Sheriff's department.

594
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:11,211
If someone's in there,
come out where I can see you.

595
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

596
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

597
00:59:20,468 --> 00:59:22,393
Oh, my God.

598
00:59:24,205 --> 00:59:31,476
So, when they took you
on board their... space ship,

599
00:59:32,546 --> 00:59:36,417
did they give you one of them...

600
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,221
you know, anal probes?

601
00:59:40,521 --> 00:59:42,851
Oh, yeah, very original
you fucking idiot,

602
00:59:42,951 --> 00:59:46,193
I already told you it was my girlfriend
who got taken, not me!

603
00:59:46,293 --> 00:59:47,862
Hey!

604
00:59:48,162 --> 00:59:53,134
You know, you ain't got to go
into outer space to get probed.

605
00:59:53,234 --> 00:59:57,738
You'll be getting plenty of that
in the shower every day

606
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:01,474
from a big guy named Mootombo.

607
01:00:07,047 --> 01:00:10,484
Sheriff, you have got to get a load
of this kid's story.

608
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:13,954
The boys back at the station,
they're gonna love this!

609
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:19,525
Sheriff? Hey, you with me?

610
01:00:22,896 --> 01:00:24,732
They're tellin' the truth.

611
01:00:26,967 --> 01:00:29,770
You see? I fucking told you!

612
01:00:30,971 --> 01:00:33,107
You can't be serious.

613
01:00:33,507 --> 01:00:36,989
I mean, come on man,
these kids are obviously high as kites,

614
01:00:37,089 --> 01:00:39,613
makin' this shit up! UFOs?

615
01:00:39,713 --> 01:00:43,648
Alien abductions?
I mean, this is horseshit!

616
01:00:50,591 --> 01:00:52,793
It's because of this, isn't it?

617
01:00:53,093 --> 01:00:56,308
It's been ten years, Alan.

618
01:00:56,597 --> 01:01:00,168
Now look. I mean no disrespect,

619
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:03,944
but it is time to face reality, man.

620
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:05,684
She left you.

621
01:01:07,307 --> 01:01:11,358
People have been trying to
convince me that she just split town,

622
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:15,377
just took off with another guy.
People have been saying it so long

623
01:01:15,477 --> 01:01:19,519
I almost believed it myself
but now I know what happened.

624
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,267
What the hell are you talkin' about?

625
01:01:22,367 --> 01:01:27,561
She would have never done that to me.
We were in love with each other.

626
01:01:27,661 --> 01:01:33,298
That night I went to bed sleeping
next to her and I woke up...

627
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,736
and she was...

628
01:01:36,937 --> 01:01:39,140
she was gone.

629
01:01:40,941 --> 01:01:45,179
She didn't take any of her clothes,
didn't leave a note.

630
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,716
How could she lock the front door
without taking her keys?

631
01:01:51,017 --> 01:01:53,077
I don't know,

632
01:01:53,179 --> 01:01:57,491
but I think you need to accept the fact
that she ain't never coming back.

633
01:01:57,691 --> 01:02:00,892
If it had been her choice,
Mitchell, then I would.

634
01:02:00,992 --> 01:02:03,630
But I don't think she had one,
she was taken from me!

635
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:07,135
Kidnapped, abducted, whatever you
want to call it, but goddammit,

636
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
what happened to her is what's happening
to these kids right now!
And we gotta get 'em outta here.

637
01:02:17,444 --> 01:02:21,449
Whoa, what the hell is that?
What the hell is that!?

638
01:02:28,589 --> 01:02:32,337
Oh, shit! Start the damn car!

639
01:03:15,936 --> 01:03:16,934
Don't do it!

640
01:03:21,175 --> 01:03:23,538
Fuck!

641
01:03:26,179 --> 01:03:30,281
Fuck! Shit! Shit!

642
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

643
01:03:43,497 --> 01:03:44,765
Are you ok?

644
01:03:44,865 --> 01:03:47,167
Get me out of this fucking car!

645
01:03:47,467 --> 01:03:50,871
Get these things off me, man!
Get 'em off, get 'em off!

646
01:03:51,171 --> 01:03:53,607
- What the fuck happened?
- Shit!

647
01:03:54,808 --> 01:03:58,515
They made him do it!
They got inside his fucking head,

648
01:03:58,615 --> 01:04:03,550
and they made him blow
his own fucking brains out! Oh, shit.

649
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:05,753
Shit, they're gonna take control
of all of us!

650
01:04:05,853 --> 01:04:08,322
- Just stay away from me!
- Seth. Calm down, ok?

651
01:04:08,422 --> 01:04:12,693
We can't stay here, ok? We can't stay here
'cause this shit, this shit

652
01:04:12,793 --> 01:04:16,995
is not gonna do anything, alright?
We are gonna die in here.

653
01:04:18,999 --> 01:04:20,801
- Give me that cop's gun.
- What?

654
01:04:20,901 --> 01:04:23,804
I said give me the fucking gun!

655
01:04:23,904 --> 01:04:27,123
- Shut the fuck up, Melanie.
- Put the fucking gun down.

656
01:04:27,223 --> 01:04:28,761
Oh, my God!

657
01:04:29,376 --> 01:04:32,106
I'm the one with the gun,
so you listen to me, ok?

658
01:04:32,206 --> 01:04:34,365
Do you understand that, tough guy?

659
01:04:34,465 --> 01:04:37,582
- Seth!
- Back the fuck off!

660
01:04:39,586 --> 01:04:43,291
Ok, everyone, just calm down, alright?

661
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:47,327
Ok, ok, just let me think.

662
01:04:47,427 --> 01:04:49,930
Just let me think, ok.

663
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:53,834
Those fuckers are not gonna
get inside my head.

664
01:04:54,034 --> 01:04:58,940
Just give me a second, alright?
Just... everyone just fucking calm down.

665
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,609
Let me think. These fuckers are not
gonna get inside my head, alright?

666
01:05:02,709 --> 01:05:05,522
So this is what we're gonna do.
We're gonna make a break for town,

667
01:05:05,622 --> 01:05:09,216
you're coming with me, you get up,
you're coming with me.

668
01:05:09,316 --> 01:05:13,887
You stay put, because this is your fault.
They want you!

669
01:05:13,987 --> 01:05:16,323
So if they want you,
they can fucking have you!

670
01:05:16,423 --> 01:05:19,359
You're out of your fucking mind, Seth!
We're not leaving without her.

671
01:05:19,459 --> 01:05:21,995
Is that right? Is that right?

672
01:05:22,295 --> 01:05:24,631
Well, to hell with you.

673
01:05:24,731 --> 01:05:27,332
You can all stay here and rot.

674
01:05:31,104 --> 01:05:33,341
Have fun on your fucking honeymoon!

675
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:36,209
Oh, my God, are you ok?

676
01:05:36,309 --> 01:05:37,545
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

677
01:05:37,645 --> 01:05:40,278
I can see why you
didn't want him to come.

678
01:05:55,729 --> 01:05:57,695
You guys?

679
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the fuck was that?

680
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Get away from the window!
- Oh, God.

681
01:06:47,281 --> 01:06:48,916
Oh, my God.

682
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

683
01:07:45,405 --> 01:07:47,668
We gotta get to the basement!

684
01:07:49,376 --> 01:07:52,675
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go!

685
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:57,716
Kyle, let's go!

686
01:08:02,455 --> 01:08:05,559
- Kyle, what're you doing?
- I'm not letting them get you, babe.

687
01:08:05,659 --> 01:08:07,895
No, Kyle! Open the fucking door!

688
01:08:07,995 --> 01:08:12,632
- No, I'm gonna be ok!
- No, Kyle, please don't do this!

689
01:08:12,732 --> 01:08:15,669
Babe, there's no other choice.
I have to, I'm sorry.

690
01:08:15,869 --> 01:08:18,238
You are gonna get out of here,
and you're gonna survive.

691
01:08:18,338 --> 01:08:21,875
No! What about you?

692
01:08:22,175 --> 01:08:23,941
I'm full of surprises!

693
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,891
Kyle?

694
01:08:29,649 --> 01:08:34,020
Kyle, No! Kyle! Kyle!

695
01:08:40,694 --> 01:08:42,062
Ok.

696
01:09:01,181 --> 01:09:03,717
Hey! I'm up here, you motherfucker!

697
01:09:03,817 --> 01:09:05,920
Up here! Come on!

698
01:09:31,711 --> 01:09:34,147
Shit! Shit!

699
01:09:35,248 --> 01:09:37,517
Fuck. Shit.

700
01:09:37,617 --> 01:09:42,520
No, no, no. Fuck. Fuck! Shit!

701
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:52,143
Ok, alright. Fuck.

702
01:10:00,107 --> 01:10:02,106
Who's there?

703
01:10:06,413 --> 01:10:08,580
Who's out there!?

704
01:10:12,886 --> 01:10:15,756
Fuck, who's out there?! Huh?

705
01:10:18,592 --> 01:10:20,907
Fuck you!

706
01:10:22,229 --> 01:10:24,598
You motherfucker!

707
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:27,678
You're not taking me!

708
01:10:29,703 --> 01:10:33,071
You fuck! Shit! Shit!

709
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

710
01:11:15,815 --> 01:11:18,683
Fuck! Fuck!

711
01:11:23,857 --> 01:11:26,569
No! No!

712
01:11:31,097 --> 01:11:34,233
No, no, please, you can't take me!
You can't...

713
01:12:04,397 --> 01:12:08,935
You remember when we came out here
that summer before high school started?

714
01:12:09,035 --> 01:12:12,672
Yeah, it was right before
my parents broke up.

715
01:12:12,772 --> 01:12:17,476
We raided your parents' liquor cabinet
and got so drunk.

716
01:12:20,981 --> 01:12:24,415
And your dad took us
fishing the next day...

717
01:12:25,616 --> 01:12:27,836
And you threw up all over the boat.

718
01:12:30,156 --> 01:12:36,396
And you covered for me,
you said that I was just sea sick.

719
01:12:36,496 --> 01:12:39,197
We were only on the lake.

720
01:12:43,303 --> 01:12:47,332
That was the best summer ever.

721
01:12:57,450 --> 01:13:00,352
I think I took too many.

722
01:13:01,053 --> 01:13:04,892
No, Mel. No, Mel, why did you do that?

723
01:13:05,192 --> 01:13:09,850
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

724
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:15,959
I don't want to go up there.
I don't want them to take me.

725
01:13:16,459 --> 01:13:20,060
No. No, it's ok.

726
01:13:24,377 --> 01:13:26,947
I'm really tired.

727
01:13:27,447 --> 01:13:31,018
I think I'm gonna close my eyes
for a little while.

728
01:13:31,318 --> 01:13:33,486
No. No.

729
01:13:33,586 --> 01:13:37,023
No, Mel, no, no! Please, no!

730
01:13:37,123 --> 01:13:39,426
Mel! Wake up!

731
01:13:39,526 --> 01:13:43,663
Mel, wake up! Don't do this to me!

732
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

733
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

734
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

735
01:17:42,101 --> 01:17:43,829
Kyle?

736
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,776
No. No!

737
01:17:49,876 --> 01:17:51,644
No!

738
01:17:51,944 --> 01:17:54,083
No, wait!

739
01:17:54,183 --> 01:17:56,833
No! Don't go!

740
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:16,905
Come back, please!

741
01:18:17,371 --> 01:18:19,304
Come back!

742
01:18:20,707 --> 01:18:24,344
Come back! Come back!

743
01:18:25,044 --> 01:18:27,514
No, please! Come back!

744
01:18:27,814 --> 01:18:29,609
Come get me!

745
01:18:30,516 --> 01:18:32,621
Come get me!

746
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,577
I'm right here, please!

747
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:41,726
No, please.

748
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,690
I'm sorry, Kyle.

749
01:19:13,593 --> 01:19:16,435
I'm sorry, Kyle.

750
01:23:33,186 --> 01:23:35,517
Oh, oh, shit!

751
01:23:41,027 --> 01:23:44,342
Help! Somebody, help!

752
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

753
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:14,042
Fuck!

754
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, my God.

755
01:26:49,548 --> 01:26:50,850
Kyle!

756
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:54,309
Oh, my God, Kyle!

757
01:26:55,487 --> 01:26:58,055
I'm gonna get you out of here!

758
01:26:59,258 --> 01:27:00,725
It's ok.

759
01:27:02,726 --> 01:27:04,461
It's ok.

760
01:27:05,064 --> 01:27:08,067
No. No!

761
01:27:08,167 --> 01:27:10,774
No. Kyle!

762
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:28,021
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

763
01:27:31,223 --> 01:27:33,317
Oh, God.

764
01:27:34,326 --> 01:27:39,617
When you proposed, I should have
said yes, I was just scared.

765
01:27:40,466 --> 01:27:43,702
Well, I'm not scared anymore.

766
01:27:43,802 --> 01:27:48,739
Because what I said about us being alone,
I know that's not true.

767
01:27:54,246 --> 01:27:57,549
So wake up. Wake up!

768
01:27:57,950 --> 01:28:02,587
You're not dying!
No, you're not dying! Wake up, Kyle!

769
01:28:05,324 --> 01:28:09,494
No, wake up, Kyle! Kyle, wake up!

770
01:28:09,795 --> 01:28:11,863
Wake up!

771
01:28:12,764 --> 01:28:16,836
Kyle! Kyle, wake up! Wake up!

772
01:28:23,275 --> 01:28:28,347
Oh, my God, it's ok!
Just breathe! Just breathe!

773
01:28:28,647 --> 01:28:32,135
April! What're you doing here?

774
01:28:32,851 --> 01:28:35,922
It's "April and Kyle", remember?

775
01:28:36,222 --> 01:28:38,406
Where you go, I go.

776
01:28:40,092 --> 01:28:42,761
I didn't mean outer space.

777
01:30:08,314 --> 01:30:10,273
What happened?

778
01:30:13,619 --> 01:30:15,955
I don't know.

779
01:30:17,456 --> 01:30:19,010
You came back for me.

780
01:30:22,027 --> 01:30:24,665
You're fucking crazy, April.

781
01:30:32,137 --> 01:30:34,764
You just realized that now?

782
01:30:55,727 --> 01:31:00,593
<i>The book of love is long and boring</i>

783
01:31:00,693 --> 01:31:05,204
<i>No one can lift the damn thing</i>

784
01:31:05,504 --> 01:31:10,375
<i>It's full of charts
and facts and figures</i>

785
01:31:10,475 --> 01:31:14,413
<i>And instructions for dancing</i>

786
01:31:14,513 --> 01:31:17,205
<i>But I,</i>

787
01:31:20,318 --> 01:31:24,690
<i>I love it when you read to me</i>

788
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:27,247
<i>You</i>

789
01:31:30,362 --> 01:31:34,831
<i>You can read me anything</i>

790
01:31:39,838 --> 01:31:44,543
<i>The book of love has music in it</i>

791
01:31:44,643 --> 01:31:47,413
<i>In fact that's where...</i>

792
01:31:47,713 --> 01:31:49,715
Wait, wait, wait.

793
01:31:50,516 --> 01:31:52,653
Do you hear that?

794
01:31:55,354 --> 01:31:57,223
What is that?

795
01:31:58,624 --> 01:31:59,923
It's over there!

796
01:32:03,929 --> 01:32:06,665
<i>I love it when you sing to me</i>

797
01:32:06,765 --> 01:32:09,199
Hey! Over here!

798
01:32:12,671 --> 01:32:14,505
Help us!

799
01:32:39,131 --> 01:32:42,151
No! No, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

800
01:34:36,782 --> 01:34:38,984
That's the last of them.

801
01:34:39,084 --> 01:34:42,621
Good. Do we know anything yet?

802
01:34:42,721 --> 01:34:46,992
Intel is still coming in, but it looks like
the storm caused the crash.

803
01:34:47,092 --> 01:34:49,327
Like the one last year in Portugal.

804
01:34:49,427 --> 01:34:53,264
- Fatalities?
- Fairly minimal.

805
01:34:53,765 --> 01:34:56,468
Stories are already being prepared.

806
01:34:56,568 --> 01:34:59,205
What should we do with the bodies?

807
01:35:12,618 --> 01:35:15,165
Same thing we always do.

808
01:35:38,143 --> 01:35:41,780
<i>When I die and they lay me to rest</i>

809
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:45,683
<i>Gonna go to the place that's the best</i>

810
01:35:45,783 --> 01:35:49,487
<i>When I lay me down to die</i>

811
01:35:49,587 --> 01:35:53,325
<i>Goin' up to the spirit in the sky</i>

812
01:35:53,425 --> 01:35:56,995
<i>Goin' up to the spirit in the sky</i>

813
01:35:57,095 --> 01:36:01,066
<i>That's where I'm gonna go when I die</i>

814
01:36:01,166 --> 01:36:04,002
<i>When I die and they lay me to rest</i>

815
01:36:04,102 --> 01:36:08,504
<i>Gonna go to the place that's the best</i>

816
01:36:24,255 --> 01:36:27,592
<i>Prepare yourself, you know it's a must</i>

817
01:36:27,692 --> 01:36:31,763
<i>Gotta have a friend in Jesus</i>

818
01:36:31,863 --> 01:36:35,166
<i>So you know that when you die</i>

819
01:36:35,266 --> 01:36:39,104
<i>He's gonna recommend you
to the spirit in the sky</i>

820
01:36:39,204 --> 01:36:43,441
<i>Gonna recommend you
to the spirit in the sky</i>

821
01:36:43,541 --> 01:36:47,245
<i>That's where you're gonna go
when you die</i>

822
01:36:47,345 --> 01:36:50,215
<i>When you die and they lay you to rest</i>

823
01:36:50,315 --> 01:36:54,650
<i>You're gonna go to the place
that's the best</i>

824
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:44,692
<i>Never been a sinner, I've never sinned</i>

825
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:48,963
<i>I got a friend in Jesus</i>

826
01:37:49,063 --> 01:37:52,266
<i>So you know that when I die</i>

827
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:56,204
<i>He's gonna me send me up
with the spirit in the sky</i>

828
01:37:56,304 --> 01:38:00,441
<i>Oh, send me up
with the spirit in the sky</i>

829
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:04,245
<i>That's where I'm gonna go when I die</i>

830
01:38:04,345 --> 01:38:07,215
<i>When I die and they lay me to rest</i>

831
01:38:07,315 --> 01:38:11,350
<i>Gonna go to the place that's the best</i>

832
01:38:11,451 --> 01:38:15,551
<i>Gonna go to the place that's the best</i>
