2
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:13,505
She was possessed and
died during an exorcism.

3
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:15,975
It happened four days ago, but
they're being arrested and charged now.

4
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:18,279
- For murder.
- Why murder?

5
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,314
Because the autopsy report
said it was a homicide.

6
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:22,516
Really, Nic, a possessed nun story?

7
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:25,018
She was tied to a cross for three
days, given no food or water.

8
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,589
They crucified her.

9
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:28,557
She was only 23.

10
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:32,727
Actually, I managed to speak to
the priest's lawyer this morning

11
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:34,061
and he said he could set
up an interview for me.

12
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:36,631
Rule number one: editors assign stories.

13
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,767
Good journalists find
them. You taught me that.

14
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,901
- We both know why you're doing this.
- It's a good story.

15
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:43,639
No, it's another chance for
you to nail faith to the wall,

16
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,508
and it's not gonna bring your mother back.

17
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,412
We're talking about a priest who murdered
a young woman in the name of religion.

18
00:03:50,414 --> 00:03:52,514
People deserve to know about that.

19
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:54,719
For a journalist, you
don't sound too objective.

20
00:03:56,921 --> 00:04:00,490
Okay, Uncle Phil, you want
both sides of the story?

21
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:02,825
How about is this a
madman who murdered a nun

22
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:05,464
or a holy man who lost
a fight with a demon?

23
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,700
Come on.

24
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:10,033
Let me find out.

25
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:11,635
Please?

26
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:13,970
All right, you got your shot.

27
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:15,973
- But you're checking in with me.
- Thanks, Phil.

28
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:20,414
Mmm. You have your mother's
persistence, I'll give you that.

29
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,335
Ms. Rawlins.

30
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:31,622
The doctor had good intentions,

31
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:34,458
but you can't take the devil
out of people with pills.

32
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,163
God and I both know where the truth lies.

33
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:41,098
But you're the one in jail.

34
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,635
Perhaps he feels I'm
needed behind these walls,

35
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:48,173
where many have lost their faith
or have none to comfort them.

36
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:51,943
How do you feel about not
getting the Church's support?

37
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:53,914
I expected it.

38
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,715
They never liked how I was
doing things, but that's okay.

39
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:58,785
I was never doing it for them.

40
00:05:58,787 --> 00:06:01,455
I was doing it for God and my congregation.

41
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:04,491
So why do you think she was
possessed in the first place?

42
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:07,829
She told me about a
sexual experience she had.

43
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:10,865
She had given herself to a boy in Germany.

44
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,968
It got her to question her
faith, making her a target.

45
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,506
I'm sure his seduction was
influenced by the devil.

46
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:22,544
You know, demons are everywhere,
waiting for their opportunity.

47
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:24,946
They're saying you crucified her.

48
00:06:24,948 --> 00:06:27,715
Only because we had to
put her on the cross.

49
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:29,718
No!

50
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,156
The demon knew our intent

51
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:36,658
and had become incredibly
violent against Adelina.

52
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:54,578
So we took Adelina into the church.

53
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,215
We wanted her to feel as close
to God as we could get her.

54
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:11,096
It took a while to get the name
of the demon possessing her,

55
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,565
but we finally did.

56
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:17,238
Agares! Agares!

57
00:07:22,577 --> 00:07:25,177
I knew I was dealing with
an incredibly powerful demon

58
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:27,847
because it could use the
name of God and Mother Mary.

59
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:30,018
Lesser demons can't.

60
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,754
It was at the end of the third day

61
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:35,092
when I could finally feel
the demon starting to give up.

62
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:20,638
The moment I looked into her eyes,

63
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,607
I knew the exorcism was over.

64
00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:25,376
The demon had seen the conflict
between the bishop and myself,

65
00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:27,979
and that destroyed everything
I had done up to that moment.

66
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:30,082
And it wasn't worried anymore.

67
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:32,685
She'd be alive today
if he hadn't interfered.

68
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:34,557
So what happened?

69
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:40,225
She was worn out, vulnerable.

70
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:44,163
The demon took her life
on the way to the hospital.

71
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:46,667
If I only had a little more
time, she would have been saved.

72
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:50,170
I understand an exorcist
needs years of experience

73
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:53,774
in order to recognize and
deal with the possessed.

74
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:55,342
But you haven't had any.

75
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:57,711
And neither did Moses,

76
00:08:57,713 --> 00:09:00,584
but with God's strength
he parted the Red Sea.

77
00:09:04,154 --> 00:09:08,658
I quit my studies because following
the strict rules of the Church

78
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,226
wouldn't allow me to help
those who needed it most.

79
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:13,931
Thanks. That's all I need.

80
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,638
God told me you were here to help.

81
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,150
Because she was so unresponsive, she
was given a high dose of adrenaline

82
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:33,718
when the ambulance arrived.

83
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,252
The autopsy was to determine if perhaps

84
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:37,888
- that was the cause of death.
- So how did she die?

85
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,061
Well, basically, her larynx had
collapsed, cutting off the air supply.

86
00:09:42,063 --> 00:09:43,995
Because she was dehydrated?

87
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:46,931
It might have been some
factor, but not usually.

88
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:50,301
In most cases, it's strangulation
that causes a collapsed larynx.

89
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:51,673
She was choked?

90
00:09:53,073 --> 00:09:55,174
There were no bruise marks.

91
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:57,711
When I dissected the neck area,
actually I thought she might have had

92
00:09:57,713 --> 00:09:59,812
some sort of oral or pharyngeal cancer,

93
00:09:59,814 --> 00:10:02,115
which, in some cases,
could impinge on the larynx.

94
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:05,486
But the tissue samples and the
biopsies came back inconclusive,

95
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:07,254
as I thought they might.

96
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:09,026
Why was that?

97
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,796
'Cause I'd never seen anything like it.

98
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,070
I hope you've got a strong stomach.

99
00:10:29,748 --> 00:10:32,748
So if you don't know what this is,

100
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,118
how can you ever have a
conclusive cause of death?

101
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,520
If we have enough contributing factors,

102
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:39,756
we can make an educated guess.

103
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:42,225
And in this case, what that
girl endured for three days

104
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:44,527
definitely contributed to her death.

105
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:46,900
The photos tell us that much.

106
00:10:58,145 --> 00:11:01,412
How's it going? Did you
get to speak to the priest?

107
00:11:01,414 --> 00:11:04,849
Father Dumitru, yeah. He's adamant
the only reason the nun died

108
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:07,553
is 'cause Bishop Gornik prevented
him from completing the exorcism.

109
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:10,422
But the coroner I met
with thinks it's murder.

110
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:13,793
It's her funeral today, so I'm heading
up to Tanacu to see what I can find out.

111
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:18,065
All right, you take care of
yourself, and. um, call me later.

112
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

113
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:01,140
- Excuse me, Sister?
- Yes?

114
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:03,308
You were close with Sister Marinescu?

115
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,612
Since we were children.

116
00:14:05,614 --> 00:14:08,048
My name's Nicole Rawlins
and I'm a journalist.

117
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,650
Please just leave us alone.

118
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:12,285
Look, I'm just curious about
what happened, that's all.

119
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:15,389
I don't understand how
Father Dumitru could kill her.

120
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:16,993
They didn't kill her.

121
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What are you doing?!

122
00:17:48,821 --> 00:17:51,556
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.
- You have to leave now.

123
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:53,759
- I was just wondering if you could help me...
- This way.

124
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:55,962
...by answering a few questions
about the death of Sister Marinescu.

125
00:17:55,964 --> 00:17:57,866
This way. Now.

126
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,040
Hi. Do you have a room available?

127
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:40,411
- Yes, of course.
- Great.

128
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,447
You don't know what's
going on outside, do you?

129
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:46,283
What's with all the masks?

130
00:18:46,285 --> 00:18:48,717
They are setting up for
the Strigoi Festival.

131
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:50,387
And what's that?

132
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:52,354
A long time ago, once a year,

133
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:54,859
villagers would exhume the
body of someone they thought

134
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:57,727
to be an evil person and remove the heart.

135
00:18:57,729 --> 00:19:02,900
Then they would burn it, mix the ashes
with water from the local well and drink it.

136
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:05,403
They wore masks to cover their faces...

137
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:08,340
...protecting their
identity from dead souls.

138
00:19:08,342 --> 00:19:11,876
But now it's just another
celebration to drink and have fun,

139
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:14,680
I suppose a lot like
your... how do you say...

140
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:16,081
- Halloween.
- Yes.

141
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,817
And how many nights will you be staying?

142
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:20,486
Can I kind of let you know as I go?

143
00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:21,923
Yes, of course.

144
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,570
By lighting the prayer
candles, we not only pray,

145
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,906
but our prayers become symbols
of the one light of Christ.

146
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:13,109
Light also affirms the power of goodness

147
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,846
over the darkness of evil.

148
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,849
I'm Father Anton.

149
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:19,417
Nicole Rawlins.

150
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,119
Is there someone you'd like to pray for?

151
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:23,888
Actually, I came in here
hoping to talk to you.

152
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,724
I saw you at Sister Marinescu's funeral.

153
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,897
You mind if I ask you a few questions?

154
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,004
Do you think Father Dumitru
was responsible for her death?

155
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:40,706
I don't think it would really
be fair for me to say anything,

156
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,074
because I wasn't there.

157
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:43,942
Do you think it would be fair to say

158
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:46,545
that if he truly felt she was possessed,

159
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:49,015
then it was his faith that killed her?

160
00:20:49,017 --> 00:20:51,554
You sound like you don't
have a lot of faith in faith.

161
00:20:53,055 --> 00:20:55,989
Faith is taught, it's not
something you're born with,

162
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:59,626
so whatever you end up
believing defines your actions.

163
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:02,929
Yes, but God gave you free will.

164
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:05,702
It's your choice to accept
those teachings or not.

165
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,105
There was a nun with brown
hair crying over the casket.

166
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:14,142
- Yes, Sister Vaduva.
- And the man standing next to her?

167
00:21:14,144 --> 00:21:17,712
The man was Adelina's
brother, Stefan Marinescu.

168
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:19,681
- Do they live nearby?
- Yes.

169
00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:21,183
He owns a vineyard north of town.

170
00:21:21,185 --> 00:21:25,587
Sister Vaduva said that
"they" didn't kill her.

171
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:29,159
Is there something going on here that
the Church doesn't want her to talk about?

172
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:31,828
I think if you want to know the
Church's response to all of this,

173
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,963
you should speak with Bishop Gornik.

174
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:36,098
Father Dumitru's monastery
was under his governance

175
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,202
and sanctifying responsibility.

176
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:41,474
You can find him at the Saint
Joseph Cathedral in Bucharest.

177
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:45,076
I'm curious...

178
00:21:45,078 --> 00:21:47,779
Is it normal to tie someone
to a cross during an exorcism?

179
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:50,815
No. I hope you find
what you're looking for.

180
00:21:50,817 --> 00:21:52,153
Good night.

181
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,260
Please, take a seat.

182
00:23:33,262 --> 00:23:35,598
I appreciate you seeing me.

183
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:38,632
I'm sorry about yesterday.

184
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:42,103
It wasn't the right time
or place for either of us.

185
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:44,739
I apologize as well.

186
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:48,177
What happened has been very
disturbing for all of us.

187
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,814
I understand that you have some questions.

188
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:54,849
Yes, um...

189
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,952
I'd like to know why the
Church isn't defending

190
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:59,120
Father Dumitru's actions.

191
00:23:59,122 --> 00:24:02,059
Exorcisms aren't out of the
ordinary within your Church.

192
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:08,365
Why don't we take a walk.

193
00:24:10,168 --> 00:24:13,235
After the collapse of
Communism 20 years ago

194
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:15,972
and people could practice religion again,

195
00:24:15,974 --> 00:24:19,243
there was a surge of monasteries
and churches being built...

196
00:24:19,245 --> 00:24:23,883
so many that the Church couldn't
train clergy fast enough.

197
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,418
Father Dumitru was one of them.

198
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,424
I'm actually the one who ordained him.

199
00:24:32,426 --> 00:24:35,726
Had he ever performed an exorcism before?

200
00:24:35,728 --> 00:24:40,032
Yes, and that was another
issue we had with him.

201
00:24:40,034 --> 00:24:43,670
Some priests might perform
one or two exorcisms a year,

202
00:24:43,672 --> 00:24:46,339
and many none at all.

203
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:49,241
He's done four in the last ten months.

204
00:24:49,243 --> 00:24:51,244
Why so many?

205
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:53,346
Mostly because the poor in that area

206
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:56,350
often turn to the Church to cure ills

207
00:24:56,352 --> 00:25:00,720
before they go to Romania's
broken-down healthcare system.

208
00:25:00,722 --> 00:25:03,356
Sister Marinescu wasn't possessed.

209
00:25:03,358 --> 00:25:05,029
She was mentally ill.

210
00:25:06,863 --> 00:25:10,397
I-I should have just terminated
his services a long time ago.

211
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:13,233
Then none of this would have happened.

212
00:25:13,235 --> 00:25:15,769
You have no idea how hard I prayed

213
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:18,874
that he would see the
light and change his ways.

214
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:21,376
It sickens me that deceit

215
00:25:21,378 --> 00:25:24,782
sometimes hides in the
garments of the holy.

216
00:25:28,954 --> 00:25:30,987
- Hey.
- Getting anywhere?

217
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:33,757
Yes, I spoke to Bishop Gornik and
he said he stopped the exorcism

218
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:36,792
because the nun wasn't possessed and it
looked like Father Dumitru was killing her.

219
00:25:36,794 --> 00:25:40,129
Didn't the priest need to get the
Church's approval for the exorcism first?

220
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:43,267
Supposed to, but apparently they've had
a lot of problems with him in the past.

221
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:47,437
Phil, this isn't the first time he's performed
an exorcism on someone who didn't need it.

222
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:51,442
I guess this is beginning to look more
like a madman who murdered a nun story, huh?

223
00:25:51,444 --> 00:25:52,977
I'd say so.

224
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:56,147
It's brutal what happened to her.

225
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:59,217
Anyway, I'm heading back over to the
monastery to see what else I can find out.

226
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:03,454
All right, you take care of
yourself, and, uh, call me later.

227
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

228
00:30:26,342 --> 00:30:29,346
I am so going to hell.

229
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:37,620
I almost didn't recognize you.

230
00:30:43,361 --> 00:30:45,827
Have you got a minute?

231
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:47,763
I'm still having a hard time believing

232
00:30:47,765 --> 00:30:51,834
they couldn't see she was dying,
how they could do that to her.

233
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:55,372
Because from their perspective,
they weren't doing anything to her.

234
00:30:55,374 --> 00:30:57,343
They were trying to stop
the demon from doing it.

235
00:30:59,344 --> 00:31:01,143
No exorcism is the same,

236
00:31:01,145 --> 00:31:02,813
but there are different stages to follow

237
00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:06,750
once we know that the victim
is, in fact, possessed.

238
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,720
The first is what we
refer to as the "presence."

239
00:31:09,722 --> 00:31:12,089
It's important to find out who the demon is

240
00:31:12,091 --> 00:31:13,857
so you can cast it out.

241
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:17,328
In most cases, it has control of the body,

242
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,264
like denying it food and water.

243
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:22,768
The second we call the "breakpoint."

244
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,570
There's usually complete panic, confusion,

245
00:31:25,572 --> 00:31:28,677
accompanied by hallucinations,
noises and odors.

246
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:33,512
The next is called the "clash."

247
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:35,781
The exorcist is now in
direct battle with the demon,

248
00:31:35,783 --> 00:31:38,851
as it wants to stay in
the victim as a resident

249
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:40,756
or it must return to hell.

250
00:31:42,891 --> 00:31:45,893
The last and final stage is
referred to as the "expulsion."

251
00:31:45,895 --> 00:31:48,529
In the supreme triumph of God's will,

252
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,865
the demon leaves in the name of Jesus

253
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,667
because it's been identified.

254
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:56,373
But Adelina died. Why would he kill her?

255
00:31:58,175 --> 00:32:00,574
He didn't need her any more.

256
00:32:00,576 --> 00:32:03,744
One dead nun, five other
clergy in jail for murder,

257
00:32:03,746 --> 00:32:07,149
another dark stain on
the fabric of the Church.

258
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:10,253
And not being exorcised, it
was free to possess again.

259
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:12,354
Demons can possess again?

260
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:14,389
It's called transference,

261
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,194
the demon moving from
one vessel to another.

262
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:20,531
Sometimes it's merely through
physical contact with the possessed,

263
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:23,667
but most often, it possesses
through a weakened soul.

264
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:27,774
The possessed reflect the
demon's anger and its black soul.

265
00:32:33,947 --> 00:32:38,252
It has some pretty good information
about demons that you might find useful.

266
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:45,493
What are these?

267
00:32:47,627 --> 00:32:49,630
Sometimes demons have help.

268
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:56,368
My mother used to say rays of sunshine

269
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,371
are the fingers of God,

270
00:32:58,373 --> 00:33:00,643
giving guidance and showing the way.

271
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:28,439
What?

272
00:34:34,343 --> 00:34:35,843
Come on.

273
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

274
00:35:48,957 --> 00:35:50,660
Hi.

275
00:35:54,663 --> 00:35:57,498
I told you yesterday that I
don't want to speak with you.

276
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,667
I know, and I'm sorry.

277
00:36:00,669 --> 00:36:02,103
But you said to me it
wasn't Father Dumitru...

278
00:36:02,105 --> 00:36:03,641
There's nothing more to be said.

279
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:06,644
It's God's will.

280
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:10,115
What about your will?

281
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:13,818
Father Dumitru killed your friend.

282
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,826
There is nothing I can do.

283
00:36:24,163 --> 00:36:26,562
It's Stefan, right?

284
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:29,867
If Father Dumitru didn't
kill Adelina, who did?

285
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:31,735
What do you care?

286
00:36:31,737 --> 00:36:34,871
All you people want to do is
to print lies about my sister.

287
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:36,740
You don't care what we have to say.

288
00:36:36,742 --> 00:36:38,476
And what is that?

289
00:36:38,478 --> 00:36:40,546
She wasn't sick in the head.

290
00:36:40,548 --> 00:36:44,683
Look, if you've got something
to say, then I want to help you.

291
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:46,517
Please, if Father Dumitru and the nuns

292
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:48,856
didn't kill your sister, then who did?

293
00:36:49,622 --> 00:36:50,991
Tell me.

294
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:54,596
It was the demon.

295
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,133
It spoke to me.

296
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:14,584
Adelina?

297
00:37:33,505 --> 00:37:34,773
Adelina.

298
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:55,260
Adelina.

299
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

300
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,592
Adelina!

301
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,062
Whatever was inside of
her was challenging me too.

302
00:38:59,064 --> 00:39:00,633
Testing my faith.

303
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:05,101
I've never felt anything
so evil in my entire life.

304
00:39:05,103 --> 00:39:08,972
Adelina had been in
Germany for the last year,

305
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:11,208
working as a nanny for a family

306
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,344
who had just adopted two
kids from the orphanage.

307
00:39:14,346 --> 00:39:17,281
Before she went to work
for them, the German embassy

308
00:39:17,283 --> 00:39:20,117
asked her to take a
complete psychological exam.

309
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:22,756
It's the country's policy.

310
00:39:24,825 --> 00:39:26,227
She passed.

311
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,395
Why'd she come back?

312
00:39:29,397 --> 00:39:31,831
She wanted to return to the monastery.

313
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:35,333
She wanted to work at the orphanage.

314
00:39:35,335 --> 00:39:38,404
And nothing had happened in Germany?

315
00:39:38,406 --> 00:39:40,006
No.

316
00:39:40,008 --> 00:39:42,843
It all started when she got back.

317
00:39:42,845 --> 00:39:45,012
The first thing Adelina wanted to do

318
00:39:45,014 --> 00:39:47,680
was go see Father Gabrielle
and give him a gift.

319
00:39:47,682 --> 00:39:51,218
He liked to collect porcelain
figurines of animals.

320
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,221
I'm sorry, who's Father Gabrielle?

321
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:55,390
He was a priest who
really looked out for us

322
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,692
when we were young at the orphanage.

323
00:39:58,694 --> 00:40:00,828
He and Adelina were especially close.

324
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,330
When we left and he became a bishop,

325
00:40:03,332 --> 00:40:05,733
we never saw him any more,

326
00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:08,102
except when he would come
and stay at the monastery

327
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:10,872
for work and prayer.

328
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:12,210
Stefan!

329
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,750
Adelina!

330
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:39,403
He performed exorcisms.

331
00:40:39,405 --> 00:40:41,976
We wish he could have helped Adelina.

332
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:15,242
No!

333
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,018
Father Gabrielle threw
himself off the bell tower.

334
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,823
We don't know what could have driven
him to commit the ultimate sin.

335
00:41:28,825 --> 00:41:32,898
We watched as Adelina cradled
him in her arms as he died.

336
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,808
We were all devastated.

337
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,911
But Adelina took it the hardest.

338
00:41:47,913 --> 00:41:50,246
He'd been like a father to her.

339
00:41:50,248 --> 00:41:53,117
We don't know why he was even up there.

340
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,189
He never rang the bell before.

341
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:02,126
Afterwards, I'd always find
Adelina in the church, crying.

342
00:42:02,128 --> 00:42:04,165
She was so upset.

343
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:09,000
Then one time, we were
all heading in for Mass...

344
00:42:09,002 --> 00:42:11,772
...she refused to go in.

345
00:42:43,974 --> 00:42:46,842
It got a lot worse after that.

346
00:43:22,983 --> 00:43:24,249
Phil, she described some really

347
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:25,950
disturbing things that happened.

348
00:43:25,952 --> 00:43:27,352
Did you believe her?

349
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,654
Well, I believe she believes what she saw.

350
00:43:29,656 --> 00:43:32,424
I guess when you're in the
land of vampires and werewolves,

351
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:35,931
- anything could happen.
- Yeah, I guess so.

352
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:45,274
I read your piece on unanswered prayers.

353
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:50,075
I went online.

354
00:43:53,448 --> 00:43:55,116
Thank you.

355
00:44:08,965 --> 00:44:10,999
For someone who doesn't believe in God,

356
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:14,036
I'm curious why you are trying so hard

357
00:44:14,038 --> 00:44:15,638
to convince others to believe the same.

358
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,277
Free will, remember?

359
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:26,149
It was interesting, the
number of people you quoted

360
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:28,117
who had prayed to God to help them

361
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:31,155
but their prayers went unheard.

362
00:44:31,157 --> 00:44:33,523
What about the prayers that were heard?

363
00:44:33,525 --> 00:44:36,260
The miracles, the miraculous healings

364
00:44:36,262 --> 00:44:38,461
that have occurred over the centuries?

365
00:44:38,463 --> 00:44:41,401
So it's a selective process
whose prayers God responds to?

366
00:44:44,705 --> 00:44:50,040
Whether it be Satan or
people's wills or disbelief,

367
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:52,177
I think it's important
for people to understand

368
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:53,980
that it's not God who
seems so unpredictable.

369
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,449
He's not the one who failed to answer.

370
00:44:56,451 --> 00:44:58,686
We are the ones who have failed to receive.

371
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:08,363
Why is this so important to you?

372
00:45:12,468 --> 00:45:14,434
I think people only pray

373
00:45:14,436 --> 00:45:16,973
because they believe they
can't fix things themselves.

374
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,542
Hmm.

375
00:45:23,279 --> 00:45:26,380
When I was working away
a couple of years ago,

376
00:45:26,382 --> 00:45:28,483
I got a call from my dad,

377
00:45:28,485 --> 00:45:32,787
telling me that my mom had cancer.

378
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:37,325
What he didn't tell me was that
she'd been diagnosed two years earlier

379
00:45:37,327 --> 00:45:41,297
and had been trying to beat it
without saying anything to me.

380
00:45:41,299 --> 00:45:44,067
They didn't want me to worry.

381
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:48,538
I'd been travelling a lot for work,
so I hadn't really been around much.

382
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:54,644
When I came home, I
discovered that she was done...

383
00:45:54,646 --> 00:46:00,453
with the drugs, the chemo, the needles...

384
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:04,622
...and was ready to be, as she put it,

385
00:46:04,624 --> 00:46:07,494
"cradled in the arms of the Lord."

386
00:46:09,595 --> 00:46:11,732
And my dad was somehow okay with that.

387
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,302
I wasn't so ready to let her
go, so I started researching

388
00:46:17,304 --> 00:46:20,641
and I found this new treatment
program that sounded great for her.

389
00:46:22,543 --> 00:46:24,545
She wouldn't even try it.

390
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:28,184
Said she was in God's hands.

391
00:46:30,185 --> 00:46:35,089
I begged my dad to change her
mind, but he wouldn't do it.

392
00:46:35,091 --> 00:46:37,723
Said we had to honor her wishes.

393
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:39,797
Said they'd prayed about it together.

394
00:46:41,297 --> 00:46:43,234
So we watched her slowly die.

395
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:46,804
I was really pissed.

396
00:46:49,505 --> 00:46:52,307
If she didn't have such
faith in a stronger afterlife,

397
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,376
she'd probably be alive today.

398
00:46:55,378 --> 00:46:58,783
That treatment program ended up
having a 90 percent success rate.

399
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:05,721
Her faith made her give up hope.

400
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:08,491
I think her faith made you lose yours.

401
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:10,860
She was fine with it.

402
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:14,431
Her relationship with
God is just that, hers.

403
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:16,136
You shouldn't judge it.

404
00:47:17,704 --> 00:47:20,303
I was trying to save her life.

405
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:22,907
For you, not her.

406
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:27,478
I think the problem is, if you
actually found out God existed,

407
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,417
then you'd have no one to blame.

408
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:44,831
You need to be careful.

409
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:48,534
Your rage against God and lack
of faith makes you an easy target,

410
00:47:48,536 --> 00:47:51,607
especially looking into what
happened to Sister Marinescu.

411
00:47:53,308 --> 00:47:54,377
Has something already happened?

412
00:47:56,212 --> 00:47:59,180
Whether you believe it
or not, demons are real.

413
00:47:59,182 --> 00:48:00,915
There is a heaven and there is a hell,

414
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:03,818
and here, now, what's
happening around this incident,

415
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:07,454
is a battlefield. You need protection.

416
00:48:07,456 --> 00:48:08,956
Without faith, you don't have any.

417
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:10,791
What about Sister Marinescu?

418
00:48:10,793 --> 00:48:13,130
Did her faith protect her?

419
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,366
Listen to me...

420
00:48:17,368 --> 00:48:20,606
It's okay. I know my own way back.

421
00:49:18,468 --> 00:49:19,736
Are you okay?

422
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:28,512
That boy standing outside,
you know who he is?

423
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:32,046
It's Tavian Amanar. He's a Gypsy.

424
00:49:35,753 --> 00:49:37,352
He's slow in the head.

425
00:49:37,354 --> 00:49:40,522
He said to me...

426
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:42,024
What's that mean?

427
00:49:42,026 --> 00:49:44,426
"It's watching you." But that's impossible.

428
00:49:44,428 --> 00:49:47,633
He can't speak. He was
born without a tongue.

429
00:49:50,734 --> 00:49:52,603
Does he live nearby?

430
00:49:52,605 --> 00:49:54,037
Yeah, he lives on a farm with his father.

431
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:57,840
You passed it coming into Tanacu.

432
00:49:57,842 --> 00:50:00,543
Please stay away from
them. They are Gypsies.

433
00:50:00,545 --> 00:50:02,045
They're liars and cheats.

434
00:50:02,047 --> 00:50:04,049
Tourists are easy targets.

435
00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:05,586
He wants something from you.

436
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

437
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

438
00:52:51,498 --> 00:52:52,998
Hey, Nic, is everything all right?

439
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,266
- Hey.
- Must be three in the morning there.

440
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:56,770
Yeah...

441
00:52:58,272 --> 00:53:00,138
I don't know, it's hard to
make sense out of something

442
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,012
- that doesn't make sense.
- How do you mean?

443
00:53:04,778 --> 00:53:06,181
Earlier I was...

444
00:53:08,682 --> 00:53:09,885
I just...

445
00:53:12,586 --> 00:53:15,788
I guess I'm just tired is all.

446
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,893
You know what, I'll call you
back in the morning, okay?

447
00:53:18,627 --> 00:53:19,926
All right.

448
00:53:19,928 --> 00:53:22,031
You get some rest. We'll speak then.

449
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:33,108
You had me a little worried last night.

450
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,876
Yeah, sorry about that.

451
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,077
Seriously, Nic, if this
is too much for you,

452
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:38,814
we don't need this story that badly.

453
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:41,216
No, I'm fine, really.

454
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,185
Actually, I'm already on my
way to go see this Gypsy boy

455
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:45,221
who seems connected to what's going on,

456
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:47,790
and, uh, and then I'm gonna head
back to Sister Vaduva's place.

457
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:50,692
All right. Let me know how it goes.

458
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:52,161
Okay, no problem.

459
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

460
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

461
00:55:00,903 --> 00:55:03,172
Thank you for coming back.

462
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,409
We just want people to
understand the truth.

463
00:55:06,411 --> 00:55:12,047
Adelina was ashamed of
what it was making her do.

464
00:55:12,049 --> 00:55:14,217
She said that the devil kept telling her

465
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:16,352
what a sinful person she was.

466
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,856
And was she?

467
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,994
Stefan doesn't know this.

468
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:25,729
But I got a letter from Adelina

469
00:55:25,731 --> 00:55:29,067
a couple of months before she came home.

470
00:55:29,069 --> 00:55:33,074
She had met a boy in
Germany and fell in love.

471
00:55:35,174 --> 00:55:36,877
He said he wanted to marry her.

472
00:55:38,813 --> 00:55:42,180
She was torn between her feelings for him

473
00:55:42,182 --> 00:55:44,052
and her commitment to God.

474
00:55:45,753 --> 00:55:47,856
She ended up giving herself to him.

475
00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:52,359
Afterwards, she realized he was just lying

476
00:55:52,361 --> 00:55:54,227
to trick her into bed.

477
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:59,031
She came back here to
ask for God's forgiveness.

478
00:55:59,033 --> 00:56:02,238
Instead, she got the devil.

479
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,893
We didn't know what to do.

480
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:57,962
So Sister Lina and I

481
00:56:57,964 --> 00:57:01,031
put all sorts of crosses, icons

482
00:57:01,033 --> 00:57:04,238
and jars of holy water in the
room where she was sleeping.

483
00:57:46,551 --> 00:57:49,350
How did she get diagnosed
with schizophrenia?

484
00:57:49,352 --> 00:57:53,091
One night, after we had all gone to bed...

485
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

486
00:59:06,504 --> 00:59:08,670
Stefan rushed Adelina to hospital.

487
00:59:08,672 --> 00:59:11,274
He was upset with what had happened,

488
00:59:11,276 --> 00:59:16,412
so he told the doctors
everything that had been going on.

489
00:59:16,414 --> 00:59:20,584
They were the ones who
insisted she see Dr. Funar.

490
00:59:20,586 --> 00:59:23,086
She was the psychologist
who said that Adelina

491
00:59:23,088 --> 00:59:25,191
had been suffering from schizophrenia.

492
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:28,394
Were you part of the exorcism?

493
00:59:30,363 --> 00:59:32,499
Not directly, no.

494
00:59:33,966 --> 00:59:35,299
But I was there.

495
00:59:40,106 --> 00:59:41,572
I was terrified.

496
00:59:41,574 --> 00:59:44,409
Water was falling everywhere.

497
00:59:44,411 --> 00:59:46,013
What do you mean?

498
00:59:48,449 --> 00:59:51,417
The demon was making it rain,

499
00:59:51,419 --> 00:59:53,319
mocking our use of holy water.

500
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:21,383
Your article...

501
01:00:21,385 --> 01:00:23,053
You'll tell them the truth, right?

502
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,559
Thank you for talking to me.

503
01:00:48,314 --> 01:00:51,049
Whatever was inside of her

504
01:00:51,051 --> 01:00:56,121
was challenging me too, testing my faith.

505
01:00:56,123 --> 01:00:59,190
I've never felt anything
so evil in my entire life,

506
01:00:59,192 --> 01:01:03,095
or seen such darkness in anyone's eyes.

507
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Adelina had been in
Germany for the last year,
working as a nanny.

508
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

509
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

510
01:02:54,617 --> 01:02:56,184
Hi.

511
01:02:56,186 --> 01:02:57,519
Are you okay?

512
01:02:57,521 --> 01:02:59,753
The... The power went out.

513
01:02:59,755 --> 01:03:03,094
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

514
01:03:03,895 --> 01:03:06,161
Um... I wasn't happy

515
01:03:06,163 --> 01:03:09,165
with the way our conversation
ended the other night.

516
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:10,435
I wanted to apologize.

517
01:03:11,902 --> 01:03:13,402
It's fine.

518
01:03:13,404 --> 01:03:14,874
A peace offering.

519
01:03:17,275 --> 01:03:18,874
Are you trying to trick me into communion?

520
01:03:18,876 --> 01:03:21,478
I forgot the bread.

521
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:25,347
If you have any more questions,

522
01:03:25,349 --> 01:03:26,819
you know where to find me.

523
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,189
Okay.

524
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,527
How about I open it?

525
01:03:34,928 --> 01:03:38,433
Actually, uh, you open
it and I'll get dressed.

526
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

527
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,956
Thank you for making
time to see me, Dr. Funar.

528
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:07,026
You have to understand
something about rural Romania.

529
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,894
Diseases of the mind, such as
schizophrenia, Tourette Syndrome

530
01:05:09,896 --> 01:05:13,365
and other forms of psychosis
are typically regarded

531
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:19,772
as sure-fire signs that some sort of
diabolical infestation is taking place.

532
01:05:19,774 --> 01:05:23,076
Well, her brother said she'd never
shown signs of anything like this before.

533
01:05:23,078 --> 01:05:25,745
There may not be any family
history of schizophrenia,

534
01:05:25,747 --> 01:05:28,081
but there is definitely some mental history

535
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:30,550
that played into my diagnosis.

536
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:33,353
I believe that Father
Gabrielle's death reignited

537
01:05:33,355 --> 01:05:35,722
all those old fears of her early childhood,

538
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:40,062
with what happened with her father's
suicide and her mother's abandonment.

539
01:05:40,064 --> 01:05:41,466
Her father killed himself?

540
01:05:43,434 --> 01:05:44,899
Yes, and she saw him do it.

541
01:05:44,901 --> 01:05:49,470
That's how Adelina
ended up in an orphanage.

542
01:05:49,472 --> 01:05:52,742
The death of the parent is one
of the most difficult experiences

543
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:56,445
a child can go through,
let alone abandonment.

544
01:06:12,097 --> 01:06:15,702
It was in this ward
that we treated Adelina.

545
01:06:23,476 --> 01:06:26,378
Father Gabrielle's
death triggered delusions

546
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:30,916
and hallucinations and
ultimately schizophrenia,

547
01:06:30,918 --> 01:06:33,322
which should have surfaced a long time ago.

548
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:39,692
She was having episodes
right here in the hospital.

549
01:06:39,694 --> 01:06:43,029
She thought we were all
demons, trying to kill her.

550
01:07:50,204 --> 01:07:52,939
Demons are everywhere,
waiting for their opportunity.

551
01:07:52,941 --> 01:07:55,874
Sister Marinescu wasn't possessed.

552
01:07:55,876 --> 01:07:57,512
She was mentally ill.

553
01:08:00,013 --> 01:08:03,583
It's called transference, the demon
moving from one vessel to another.

554
01:08:03,585 --> 01:08:06,520
But most often it possesses
through a weakened soul.

555
01:08:06,522 --> 01:08:08,056
God told me you were here to help.

556
01:08:55,909 --> 01:08:58,242
You're not far. I won't be long.

557
01:08:58,244 --> 01:08:59,813
Thank you.

558
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

559
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

560
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

561
01:10:39,221 --> 01:10:42,421
Nicole! Hey!

562
01:10:42,423 --> 01:10:44,060
Are you okay?

563
01:10:57,373 --> 01:11:00,707
Running away from this
is exactly what it wants,

564
01:11:00,709 --> 01:11:02,310
because somehow you're part of it.

565
01:11:02,312 --> 01:11:04,745
I'm not staying.

566
01:11:04,747 --> 01:11:05,950
You think it's going to go away?

567
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:12,186
Embracing fear is exactly
what the darkness wants.

568
01:11:12,188 --> 01:11:13,992
But by embracing faith...

569
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:18,193
...you have something to fight it with.

570
01:11:18,195 --> 01:11:19,428
A shield.

571
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:21,733
God's been reaching out to you.

572
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:25,701
- He wanted you here.
- To do what?

573
01:11:25,703 --> 01:11:29,139
I don't know. Maybe just forgive yourself.

574
01:11:29,141 --> 01:11:31,411
But you're not going to find
any answers running away.

575
01:11:32,912 --> 01:11:34,478
Let me help you.

576
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,380
That was the rental company.

577
01:11:36,382 --> 01:11:38,416
They said there was
nothing wrong with your car.

578
01:11:38,418 --> 01:11:41,118
It started right up.

579
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,923
They're going to drop it out front for you.

580
01:11:47,427 --> 01:11:50,965
You're safe here, I promise.

581
01:11:58,305 --> 01:12:04,910
I was in the hospital, with
my mom the night she died.

582
01:12:04,912 --> 01:12:07,981
She knew how I felt about God.

583
01:12:07,983 --> 01:12:11,517
But she took my hands in hers

584
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:17,491
and asked me to accept Jesus as my savior,

585
01:12:17,493 --> 01:12:20,296
so the two of us could
spend eternity together.

586
01:12:26,904 --> 01:12:30,208
Even with her dying, I said no.

587
01:12:33,177 --> 01:12:34,913
And she took that with her.

588
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:41,754
I'd do anything to tell her how sorry I am.

589
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:10,816
Whatever's going on here, I don't
want to be a part of it any more.

590
01:13:10,818 --> 01:13:12,320
I'm coming home.

591
01:13:14,221 --> 01:13:15,520
What really happened?

592
01:13:15,522 --> 01:13:18,925
Is an innocent man in jail?

593
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:20,395
I don't know what to think.

594
01:13:21,863 --> 01:13:23,461
All right.

595
01:13:23,463 --> 01:13:26,069
I'll have a ticket waiting
for you at the airport.

596
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:29,903
Nicole?

597
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,174
Yeah, I'll call you back in a bit.

598
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:37,144
Did you know Father Gabrielle?

599
01:14:40,148 --> 01:14:41,283
No.

600
01:14:45,252 --> 01:14:49,254
It's the same date my mom died.

601
01:14:49,256 --> 01:14:51,595
Can you tell me what the inscription reads?

602
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:58,367
"Now cradled in the arms of the Lord."

603
01:15:13,382 --> 01:15:15,150
Demons can possess again?

604
01:15:15,152 --> 01:15:17,286
It's called transference,

605
01:15:17,288 --> 01:15:19,988
the demon moving from
one vessel to another.

606
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:23,594
Sometimes it's merely through
physical contact with the possessed.

607
01:15:26,497 --> 01:15:29,065
Phil, Dumitru's innocent.

608
01:15:29,067 --> 01:15:31,301
Somehow Father Gabrielle
is a part of all this.

609
01:15:31,303 --> 01:15:34,006
I've gotta go back to the
monastery and figure this out.

610
01:15:51,659 --> 01:15:53,461
Are you looking for something?

611
01:15:57,364 --> 01:16:01,032
Is it true Father Gabrielle
died in Sister Marinescu's arms?

612
01:16:01,034 --> 01:16:02,304
Yes.

613
01:16:04,472 --> 01:16:07,109
He used this office when he stayed here.

614
01:16:10,611 --> 01:16:13,581
What was the last exorcism
he performed before he died?

615
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:16,150
No, no, I don't know.

616
01:16:16,152 --> 01:16:21,491
He used to keep his appointments
in here, and we can look.

617
01:16:24,393 --> 01:16:27,098
And the last person was...

618
01:16:28,564 --> 01:16:30,565
- Tavian Amanar.
- Oh, yes.

619
01:16:30,567 --> 01:16:34,035
He's a boy who lives around here.

620
01:16:34,037 --> 01:16:37,475
Yeah, I know who he is.

621
01:16:45,682 --> 01:16:47,219
Mr. Amanar?

622
01:16:48,685 --> 01:16:50,487
- Do you speak English?
- Little.

623
01:16:50,489 --> 01:16:52,589
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

624
01:16:52,591 --> 01:16:54,724
- What about?
- About Father Gabrielle

625
01:16:54,726 --> 01:16:58,127
- and what he did for your son.
- He do nothing for Tavian.

626
01:16:58,129 --> 01:17:01,264
Father Gabrielle didn't come
out here to see your son?

627
01:17:01,266 --> 01:17:04,368
No, Tavian brought him
for me. Why you here?

628
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:07,507
I think Father Gabrielle's death is
connected to something that happened here.

629
01:17:12,344 --> 01:17:16,748
The father tell me my
Tavian is very special.

630
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:18,650
Strong with God.

631
01:17:18,652 --> 01:17:21,287
My head have bad, dark thoughts.

632
01:17:21,289 --> 01:17:23,088
Nothing make me happy.

633
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:26,526
My sister tell me it's a
curse and we try to break it,

634
01:17:26,528 --> 01:17:28,661
but everything got worse.

635
01:17:28,663 --> 01:17:32,201
The voice from my head tell me kill my son.

636
01:17:33,769 --> 01:17:35,235
Almost did.

637
01:17:35,237 --> 01:17:38,272
Tavian bring me to church for help,

638
01:17:38,274 --> 01:17:42,477
but voices said it kill me if I go inside.

639
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:44,280
So Tavian bring father here.

640
01:17:46,248 --> 01:17:49,620
I thank God every day
for what father do for me.

641
01:17:52,522 --> 01:17:55,457
Did Father Gabrielle get
the name of the demon?

642
01:17:55,459 --> 01:17:59,297
Don't know. Me don't remember anything.

643
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:28,425
It took a while to get the name
of the demon possessing her.

644
01:18:28,427 --> 01:18:30,398
Agares!

645
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:33,501
Do you have a phone I can use?

646
01:18:47,781 --> 01:18:50,316
Anton, I figured it out. The last exorcism

647
01:18:50,318 --> 01:18:52,586
that Father Gabrielle performed
was on Tavian's father.

648
01:18:52,588 --> 01:18:54,788
The name of the demon was Agares.

649
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
If Father Gabrielle became
possessed by the demon,
he must have transferred it to Adelina.
Anton, it was transference.

650
01:19:04,733 --> 01:19:06,236
Nicole!

651
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:22,418
Nicole!

652
01:20:56,522 --> 01:20:59,088
You like preying on the
weak, don't you, demon?

653
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:01,659
You're wasting your time.
She has no faith to corrupt.

654
01:21:04,363 --> 01:21:06,630
You're gonna need more than
this to fight me, demon.

655
01:21:27,556 --> 01:21:30,090
Anton, it's killing me!

656
01:21:39,869 --> 01:21:41,968
Nicole, ask for God's help.

657
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:44,872
You need to have faith to fight this demon.

658
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:47,941
Shut up, demon!

659
01:21:47,943 --> 01:21:49,444
Be silent!

660
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:52,646
I adjure you. You can make it stop!

661
01:21:52,648 --> 01:21:56,551
You can make it stop, Nicole.

662
01:21:56,553 --> 01:21:57,852
Leave her, demon!

663
01:21:57,854 --> 01:21:59,489
Leave her now!

664
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:03,759
I don't need the Romana or crucifix

665
01:22:03,761 --> 01:22:05,594
to send you back to hell, demon.

666
01:22:05,596 --> 01:22:07,629
I already know your name. Agares!

667
01:22:13,705 --> 01:22:15,439
You are done with her, Agares.

668
01:22:15,441 --> 01:22:17,875
I adjure you by the living
God, by the Holy God,

669
01:22:17,877 --> 01:22:20,611
who so loved the world that
he gave up his only son.

670
01:22:20,613 --> 01:22:24,514
Begone, Satan's helper, inventor
and master of all deceit.

671
01:22:24,516 --> 01:22:26,517
Stop deceiving human creatures

672
01:22:26,519 --> 01:22:28,752
and pouring out to them the
poison of eternal damnation.

673
01:22:28,754 --> 01:22:32,556
Begone, Satan's helper,
enemy of man's salvation.

674
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Give place to the one Holy Church,
acquired by Christ at
the price of his blood.

675
01:22:42,536 --> 01:22:44,969
You've got to fight back or
you'll never see your mother again.

676
01:22:44,971 --> 01:22:48,441
You told me she taught you to be a fighter.

677
01:22:50,711 --> 01:22:52,646
You can do this. Fight back!

678
01:22:52,648 --> 01:22:54,748
Don't let this demon drag you to hell.

679
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,550
I can't do this without your help.

680
01:23:00,555 --> 01:23:02,723
Stoop beneath the
all-powerful hand of God.

681
01:23:02,725 --> 01:23:05,826
Tremble and flee when we
invoke the Holy name of Jesus,

682
01:23:05,828 --> 01:23:08,129
this name which causes hell to tremble.

683
01:23:08,131 --> 01:23:11,698
Holy is the Lord, the God of armies.

684
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,167
Be gone, demon.

685
01:23:13,169 --> 01:23:15,672
Agares, be gone.

686
01:23:33,959 --> 01:23:35,525
Nicole?

687
01:23:35,527 --> 01:23:36,926
Come on, Nicole.

688
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:38,198
Breathe!

689
01:23:39,831 --> 01:23:42,866
Nicole. Breathe.

690
01:24:24,146 --> 01:24:26,149
I saw my mom.
