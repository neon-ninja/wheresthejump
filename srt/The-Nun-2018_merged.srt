00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,303
I had a vision in Amityville.

2
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,051
I had a premonition of your death.

3
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,488
We have both seen the same inhuman spirit.

4
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,299
Mom, who is that?

5
00:01:00,836 --> 00:01:05,010
The demon in your painting is real.

6
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:09,624
The following occurred in 1952

7
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,495
Abbey of St Carta, Romania.

GOD ENDS HERE

10
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:57,548
Are you certain we're
making the right decision?

11
00:01:59,223 --> 00:02:01,453
We have no other choice.

12
00:02:18,943 --> 00:02:21,364
Will the relic truly save us?

13
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:26,338
Have faith, sister.

14
00:02:42,398 --> 00:02:44,822
Our father, who art in heaven,

15
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:47,064
hallowed be thy name,

16
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:50,576
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done

17
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:52,829
on earth as it is in heaven...

18
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:55,634
Give us this day our daily bread...

19
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:58,526
And forgive us our trespasses,

20
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,813
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

21
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:13,895
Take it!

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
This evil needs a vessel to escape.
It will come after you next.
Don't let it have you.
- You know what you must do.
- I can't.

23
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:26,630
Then, not even God...

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

25
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:38,952
Forgive me, father, for the sin
that I'm about to commit.

26
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,399
Forgive me, Lord.

27
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:34,459
Oh God!

VATICAN CITY
Father Burke?

29
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:53,206
Bishop.

30
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:59,044
So, last time you were here was what night?
Six.. seven years ago?

31
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,948
After my time as a chaplain
ended in the war, Yes.

32
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:06,622
We appreciate you coming again,
under such short notice.

33
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:10,791
Father Burke.

34
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:12,612
Sit.

35
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:20,977
We have received news that a
nun has taken her own life...

36
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:23,848
at an Abbey in the mountains of Romania.

37
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:27,428
Suicide is a terrible, a terrible sin.

38
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:32,098
But it doesn't strike me as a strong
enough reason for our reunion.

39
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:35,302
But the news of it would
not boast our arguments

40
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:38,005
to keep with the
faith and the church...

41
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:39,619
You are not telling me something.

42
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:43,830
- Why do you say that?
- Because we are in the Vatican.

43
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,966
Let me put it this way, father.

44
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:50,062
In this, orbeat rare instance...

45
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:53,715
We do not believe we are
the ones with the secret.

46
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:57,401
Those are your travel documents...

47
00:07:57,425 --> 00:08:01,805
and contact information on the
man who discovered the nun.

48
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:04,808
He lives near the Abbey in a
small village called Biertan.

49
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,856
You will want to talk to him first.

50
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:09,580
Also in the file is the
name of a postulant...

51
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:12,391
who can help assist you in your inquiries.

52
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:17,689
Since it is a cloister at convent
and your access will be limited.

53
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:23,300
She is also familiar
with the territory.

54
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:32,061
VINCENT HOSPITAL,
London, England.

55
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:35,582
I have survived many
terrifying encounters,

56
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:39,384
but nothing could have
ever prepared me for this.

57
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:44,273
My only hope now is that the
beast could not smell me.

58
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:48,881
But then, the wind changed and...

59
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,543
Run!
Run for your lives!

60
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,726
Mother superior says that
dinosaurs were never really alive.

61
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,372
God just put their bones
here, to test our faith.

62
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:05,559
That seems like a pretty
dirty trick, don't you think?

63
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,734
Wait, they are not in the Bible.

64
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:10,870
Well... do you believe in
penguins and koala bears?

65
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:13,405
- Yes.
- They aren't in the Bible either.

66
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,514
The Bible is God's love letter to us...

67
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:20,558
but, it doesn't mean that he doesn't
want us to ask questions...

68
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:22,780
about the wonders of his creation.

69
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:24,716
But Mother Superior says...

70
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,265
Wait a minute, you've got a little
something on your nose.

71
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:28,775
There.

72
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:41,032
- The Vatican?
- I'm as surprised as you.

73
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,001
- I haven't yet taken my vows yet.
- Oh! He's aware of that.

74
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:47,457
He is waiting for you in the garden.

75
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:53,382
And change in to your habit.
This is an official visit.

76
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:59,435
It shouldn't take more
than few days at most.

77
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,797
You were recommended for
the journey because

78
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:04,114
of your familiarity
with the territory.

79
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:05,377
The territory?

80
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:08,141
Yes. Romania.

81
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:13,329
I've never been in that part of the world.

82
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:16,131
- Really?
- There must have been some mistake.

83
00:10:16,155 --> 00:10:19,275
I apologize if you coming here
was a waste of your time.

84
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,629
No apologies are necessary.

85
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:25,487
Every decision that Vatican
makes, is with purpose.

86
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,983
I'm sure they had their
reasons for selecting you.

87
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:58,254
BIERTAN, ROMANIA.

88
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:04,797
What is it?

89
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:07,268
Mr Theriault?

90
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:10,904
Hi.

91
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,393
Jealous husband or angry father?

92
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,010
I'm sorry, what?

93
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:18,307
Usually it's one of the two...

94
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:20,750
when an older man and

95
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:23,348
a young, beautiful...

96
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:27,142
not so innocent girl, show up in the
doors at this hour of the morning.

97
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:31,188
I beg your pardon, Mr. Theriault,
but you and I have never met.

98
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,844
Then perhaps time we do.

99
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,649
Call Me Frenchy,

100
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:39,377
everyone does.

101
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:43,536
Mr. Theriault, we are here because
of the nun you found at the abbey.

102
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,629
How do you ...?

103
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,940
Oh you priest?

104
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,984
And she's a nun.

105
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:58,995
Forgive me for my impure thoughts, Sister.

106
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:04,131
I had no idea. Never seen
a nun out of a vestments.

107
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,182
Not that I am opposed to.

108
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,059
Excuse me.

109
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,346
Mr. Theriault...

110
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,188
The Abbey, is it far?

111
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:18,583
Not of distance, no. But
takes time to get to.

112
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:22,163
If I may ask, why were you there?

113
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,783
I was delivering the quarterly supplies.

114
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:27,823
Apparently, the Abbey
has had some kind of

115
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:31,131
arrangement with the
village for centuries.

116
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:34,485
Do you think you could take
us there sometime soon?

117
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,233
Don't think so, Father.

118
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:39,933
Is there someone else in the village then?

119
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:43,386
Everyone in this village pretend
like the Abbey does not exists.

120
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,237
Even talking about it
might get you in trouble.

121
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:48,880
It's settled then.

122
00:12:48,904 --> 00:12:50,486
You will take us.

123
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,393
- With all due respect, Father...
- Please, Frenchy.

124
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,679
<i>Hey, go home.</i>

125
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:08,307
You took a plane from Rome,
a bus from Bucharest...

126
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:11,770
And now, my friends, you
are in the dark ages.

127
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:14,042
In the backwoods of Romania.

128
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:24,360
Now you travel by horse.

129
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:26,680
Where are your things?

130
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:06,457
The postman's charge, 10 letters with an L.

131
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:10,679
Deliveries.

132
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:13,799
Yeah, but not for this, Sister.

133
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:19,602
What brings a Frenchmen to
the countryside of Romania?

134
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,829
Actually I'm French Canadian,
but don't tell anyone.

135
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:24,858
Doesn't sound as romantic.

136
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:28,667
I came here looking for gold, but
when I met the people here...

137
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:33,935
I just knew this was the place I was meant
to be. Wanted to help them. Anyway I could.

138
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:36,061
That's very noble of you.

139
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:38,009
I know.

140
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,578
Tell me sister... How
long have you been a nun?

141
00:14:44,706 --> 00:14:47,607
I'm not a nun yet,
I'm still just a novice.

142
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:50,199
You still haven't taken
your temporary vows?

143
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,685
Temporary?

144
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,992
I didn't think there was anything
temporary about being a nun.

145
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:58,495
Temporary vows would help prepare me
for a life of total consecration.

146
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,852
Would sister, or will?

147
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:06,748
What happened?

148
00:15:08,628 --> 00:15:10,014
Everything alright?

149
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,806
We walk the rest of the way.

150
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,283
The horse won't go any further.

151
00:15:18,104 --> 00:15:20,115
Maybe you should get a new horse.

152
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:23,814
It's not the horse, Father,
it's what lies ahead.

153
00:15:24,143 --> 00:15:25,220
He is scared.

154
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:29,029
Locals say it's a cursed place.
And the horse agrees.

155
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:40,028
If I may ask, Father, why is it the
church sends you on such tasks?

156
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:44,479
The Church reaches out to me when they need
some investigation into unusual phenomenon.

157
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,036
Associated with Catholicism.

158
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:50,414
Unofficially they call
it "miracle hunting."

159
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:52,445
I thought we were here
because of a suicide.

160
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:55,645
We are, but it's only part
of our investigation.

161
00:15:55,872 --> 00:16:00,906
I also have orders from the Vatican to
determine if the grounds are still...

162
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:02,869
Holy.

163
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:05,952
But I can give you my opinion
on that now, Father.

164
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:18,499
Result of the war?

165
00:16:19,694 --> 00:16:21,372
Bombing raids, yes.

166
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:24,673
I heard stories of how the ground
shook for days after them.

167
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,234
I've tried to find more information
on the castle itself...

168
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:29,680
But there is no record
of it in the village.

169
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:32,273
And the locals only spit
when it's mentioned.

170
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,347
- Spit?
- Yeah, to ward off evil.

171
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:39,639
It is an old and silly superstition.

172
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:43,060
And if you asked me, these crosses
that surround the Abbey...

173
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:45,599
They keep evil in, not out.

174
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:49,366
You tried to contact someone
inside when you found the nun?

175
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,608
I did, no one responded.

176
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:55,751
Then again in the two years
I've been delivering supplies,

177
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:57,955
She was the first nun I'd seen.

178
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:05,643
Frenchy, when you found
the nun, what did you do?

179
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:08,083
I moved it to protect the
body from the elements.

180
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:11,104
- Where did you move it to, son?
- The ice house.

181
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,647
That's where I leave my deliveries.

182
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:17,992
When I found the Sister, I thought...

183
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,186
might be, moving her in here
would help preserve her.

184
00:17:34,198 --> 00:17:35,758
<i>After You.</i>

185
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,448
I should tell you one more thing, Father.

186
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,357
- What?
- That's not how I left her.

187
00:18:09,897 --> 00:18:11,097
What do you mean?

188
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:16,262
She was laying down when I left her here.
Not like that sitting up.

189
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:37,012
There have been cases
of bodies twitching...

190
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:41,370
or sitting up, not long after death.

191
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:44,473
Yeah, but Father, who knows how long
she was dead when I found her.

192
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:47,121
- You are not helping.
- Sorry.

193
00:18:58,177 --> 00:19:01,780
- Father, what is it?
- Seems to be a key of some kind.

194
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:10,198
DELIVERIES

195
00:19:10,222 --> 00:19:13,436
That's the door the nuns would
enter from to choose supplies.

196
00:19:14,193 --> 00:19:16,426
So they wouldn't have to leave the castle.

197
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:21,211
We should give her a proper burial.

198
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:26,789
<i>In the name of the Father and
of the Son, and Holy Spirit.</i>

199
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:28,041
<i>Amen.</i>

200
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:40,708
It's common practice during the plague,

201
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:42,827
when people feared to be buried alive.

202
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:46,163
If you were unfortunate
enough for it to happen...

203
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:49,182
You could ring the bell,
to let those above

204
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:51,775
ground know, they
have made a mistake.

205
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:54,235
I think being here is a mistake.

206
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:15,284
That's where I found her.

207
00:20:56,653 --> 00:20:59,704
How is that possible? It's been weeks.

208
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:03,171
I told you. This place is...

209
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,235
What is the opposite
of a miracle, Father?

210
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:52,941
Hello?

211
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,453
Please excuse us for unannounced arrival.

212
00:23:03,804 --> 00:23:05,507
Hello?

213
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:09,514
What is it you want?

214
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:15,940
I'm Father Anthony Burke.
This is Sister Irene.

215
00:23:16,951 --> 00:23:20,820
- Are you the Reverend Mother?
- I am.

216
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:26,215
You havent taken your vows yet.

217
00:23:28,178 --> 00:23:29,531
No.

218
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:32,702
Why are you here, Father?

219
00:23:32,726 --> 00:23:37,017
We come on behalf of Rome, to inquire
about the recent death in your convent.

220
00:23:37,442 --> 00:23:39,966
Recent death?

221
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,277
One of your nuns.

222
00:23:43,372 --> 00:23:47,485
I found her outside,
hang from her neck.

223
00:23:48,131 --> 00:23:50,384
Is that so?

224
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:56,676
And you saw fit to bury her?

225
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:02,475
Would you allow us for a moment?
Please.

226
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:14,957
You should leave with him.

227
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:20,158
Are you saying you weren't aware
of the risk passing of the nun?

228
00:24:20,182 --> 00:24:24,373
Rome is concerned about safety
and well-being of your closer.

229
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:28,479
I would like to speak with your sister, so
I can offer my assurances to the church.

230
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:32,611
I can offer the assurance you seek.

231
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:35,200
I'm afraid that won't suffice.

232
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:42,111
They will just send more, and perhaps
less diplomatic church officials.

233
00:24:42,135 --> 00:24:44,492
Yes, Father.

234
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:50,626
However the gate will be closing shortly as
we are about to take out vespers..

235
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:55,972
Followed by the Great Silence
which ends near to morning.

236
00:24:55,996 --> 00:25:02,078
Come back tomorrow and you will find
the answers you seek.

237
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:08,255
There is lodging in the convent,
you may stay there.

238
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:16,811
Thank you.

239
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:30,988
Why could you not talk to the sisters now?
Why must we wait til morning?

240
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:35,997
The sisters took the vow of silence from
sunset to sunrise. That must be respected.

241
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,045
You should begin heading back yourself.

242
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:42,146
You might didn't wanna be caught
on the relics when night falls.

243
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:45,657
Better roads than here, Father.

244
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,916
We'll be fine son.
Come back in a few days.

245
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,547
That should give us enough
time to get what we need.

246
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:57,470
Yes, Father.

247
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:41,522
Hello?

248
00:27:07,346 --> 00:27:11,546
Hey... Hey!

249
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

250
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:50,041
I'll take.....that.

251
00:28:55,865 --> 00:29:02,065
OK... alright.

252
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,505
- Father?
- Hmm?

253
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:33,884
You mentioned miracle hunting before.

254
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:35,483
Is that...

255
00:29:36,077 --> 00:29:38,056
Is that a roll you sought up..

256
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,161
No. God, no.

257
00:29:41,923 --> 00:29:43,773
I'm part of a...

258
00:29:43,797 --> 00:29:46,795
small select field that church
relies on to...

259
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:50,553
look in to their more...

260
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:53,306
Unusual matters..

261
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:55,755
So you knew Bishop Forne?

262
00:29:55,778 --> 00:29:58,566
- How do you...
- Because he helped me when I was younger.

263
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:01,612
I had a series of visions
when I was a girl.

264
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:05,102
My father believed
I was mentally unstable.

265
00:30:05,126 --> 00:30:07,413
Or worse, a liar.

266
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:10,364
But word of my vision reached the church..

267
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:13,869
Cardinal Conroy, specifically, and
he sent Bishop Forne to meet with me.

268
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:16,304
What were your visions?

269
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:22,855
There were many, never
the same one repeated.

270
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:28,979
But, after each one ended.
The same thought would be stuck in my head.

271
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:31,291
Which was....what?

272
00:30:33,094 --> 00:30:35,004
Mary points the way.

273
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:46,779
What is it, Father?

274
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:54,647
I was, thinking of a similar incident I
encountered in France. During the war..

275
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:58,584
I was stationed there, near Lyon.

276
00:30:59,347 --> 00:31:02,622
I was told to investigate
a boy with visions.

277
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:08,017
But unlike your case...

278
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,767
after what I believe
with careful evaluation...

279
00:31:14,453 --> 00:31:16,655
I made the judgment he was possessed...

280
00:31:16,956 --> 00:31:20,290
I'm persuaded to act accordingly
within the laws of the church.

281
00:31:22,258 --> 00:31:25,254
My God. Daniel...

282
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:31,974
What have they done to you?

283
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:43,620
Was it a success?

284
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:46,206
The church thought so.

285
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,004
They believed the evil was cast out.

286
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:53,346
But not you.

287
00:31:55,358 --> 00:31:59,689
The most glorious Prince,
of the Heavenly Armies...

288
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,235
Saint Michael, the archangel...

289
00:32:09,966 --> 00:32:11,333
Help me, Father.

290
00:32:11,717 --> 00:32:17,095
Come to the assistance of Daniel.
The God and may in, his likeness.

291
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:20,753
- Behold the cross of Lord.
- Why don't you help me?

292
00:32:20,777 --> 00:32:23,050
Begone, you evil forces.

293
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:32,954
Daniel sustained severe injuries
during the exorcism.

294
00:32:33,462 --> 00:32:35,859
Ones from which he couldn't recover.

295
00:32:35,883 --> 00:32:38,255
Daniel, I'm so sorry.

296
00:32:46,861 --> 00:32:49,357
He died, days later.

297
00:32:53,665 --> 00:32:58,894
I often wonder, if I was too eager
with my determination.

298
00:32:59,382 --> 00:33:01,254
That is a puzzle.

299
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:09,035
Father.

300
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:11,934
Father.

301
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:21,766
Daniel?

302
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,863
Wait. No.

303
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,617
Help.

304
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,499
No.

305
00:38:03,883 --> 00:38:06,086
Help.

306
00:38:07,045 --> 00:38:08,856
Somebody.

307
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

308
00:39:59,946 --> 00:40:01,256
Help.

309
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,151
Sister Irene. Help.

310
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,828
Father?

311
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,877
Father?

312
00:40:24,948 --> 00:40:26,776
Father?

313
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,264
Help.

314
00:41:07,184 --> 00:41:09,015
Help me.

315
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,483
- Father?
- Sister?

316
00:41:25,507 --> 00:41:28,241
- Sister Irene.
- Father, I can hear you.

317
00:41:28,265 --> 00:41:30,384
Over here.

318
00:41:31,771 --> 00:41:34,559
Thank God. Thank you.

319
00:42:37,676 --> 00:42:39,960
Hurry!!

320
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

321
00:43:02,965 --> 00:43:05,254
Thank you, Thank you sister.

322
00:43:13,106 --> 00:43:16,296
How did you get in there?
The ground was covered.

323
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,653
There's some powerful evil
presence in this place.

324
00:43:27,382 --> 00:43:31,053
Maybe those books will help
shine a light on our answer.

325
00:43:34,563 --> 00:43:38,194
There's more of it,
how's that possible?

326
00:43:38,218 --> 00:43:39,712
Another puzzle.

327
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,632
Abbess?

328
00:43:58,812 --> 00:44:03,392
As requested,
we're here to speak with the nuns.

329
00:44:10,835 --> 00:44:18,075
It seems like not so much as an invitation
as we get. - I'll go find the Abbess.

330
00:44:18,385 --> 00:44:20,296
Take this.

331
00:44:22,015 --> 00:44:24,056
See what that you can find out about it.

332
00:44:24,271 --> 00:44:27,124
It was obviously important to the desist.

333
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:30,522
Sister, be careful please.

334
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:33,070
I will, Father.

335
00:44:55,116 --> 00:44:57,191
Hello?

336
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:58,947
Wait.

337
00:45:28,745 --> 00:45:30,403
<i>Plena, Dominus tecum.</i>

338
00:45:30,404 --> 00:45:35,970
<i>Benedicta Tu in mulieribus, et benedictus
fructus ventris tui nobis peccatoribus...</i>

339
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:38,618
<i>nunc, et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen.</i>

340
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,917
<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum.</i>

341
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,712
<i>Benedicta Tu in mulieribus,
et Benedict fructus ventris tui, lesus.</i>

342
00:45:48,768 --> 00:45:54,184
<i>Maria, Mater Dei, Ora pro nobis
peccatoribus, nunc, et in hor...</i>

343
00:45:54,569 --> 00:45:57,274
<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena...</i>

344
00:45:58,908 --> 00:46:02,012
<i>- benetus fructus ventris tui, lesus.
- Sister?</i>

345
00:46:02,036 --> 00:46:05,285
<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum.</i>

346
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:08,190
<i>Benedicta Tu in mulieribus...</i>

347
00:46:08,214 --> 00:46:09,984
<i>ventris tui, lesus.</i>

348
00:46:10,008 --> 00:46:14,701
<i>Sancta Maria, Mater Dei,
Ora pro nobis peccatoribus...</i>

349
00:46:14,725 --> 00:46:17,491
<i>nunc, et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen.</i>

350
00:46:17,939 --> 00:46:22,799
<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum.</i>

351
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:25,074
<i>Benedicta Tu in mulieribus...</i>

352
00:46:25,091 --> 00:46:27,214
Sister.

353
00:46:27,338 --> 00:46:30,463
We mustn't stop praying,
even for a second. This

354
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
convent has had perpetual
etheration for centuries.
This sisters prayers seems to maintain
the constant rituals.
I'm so sorry to have disturbed her.
Sister Ruth has listed more than just
someone sneaking up behind her.

355
00:46:42,796 --> 00:46:45,860
I'm Sister Oana.
We were told you were coming.

356
00:46:45,884 --> 00:46:48,371
Please, follow me.

357
00:46:49,614 --> 00:46:54,112
Benedicta Tu in mulieribus,
et Benedict fructus ventris tui, lesus.

358
00:47:05,976 --> 00:47:07,888
What?

359
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:13,938
Another round.
I told Luca it was on the house.

360
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:20,176
- Why did you cover the mirror?
- It's tradition here when someone dies.

361
00:47:20,177 --> 00:47:22,372
You cover the mirror so
the deceased doesn't

362
00:47:22,396 --> 00:47:24,595
see their reflection
and become a ghost.

363
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:28,623
- Someone died?
- You didn't hear?

364
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:31,473
Luca's daughter committed suicide.

365
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:38,013
I can't believe it.
She was just a kid.

366
00:47:38,037 --> 00:47:42,602
12 years old.
Hang herself in his barn.

367
00:47:43,462 --> 00:47:45,289
Hanged herself?

368
00:47:45,536 --> 00:47:46,822
Why?

369
00:47:46,846 --> 00:47:50,171
Why the Addi Constantine's
crop turn to dust?

370
00:47:50,195 --> 00:47:55,807
Why little Stefan struck blind?
It's that place. The abbey.

371
00:47:56,114 --> 00:48:00,496
Whatever evil is up there, it's
leaking out, poisoning us.

372
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:06,197
And that couple that you took up there
yesterday.

373
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:10,011
- Who were they?
- A priest and a nun.

374
00:48:10,035 --> 00:48:12,323
Are they still up there?

375
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:15,492
Yeah, pick them up tomorrow.

376
00:48:15,621 --> 00:48:17,649
You recently
discovered the body up

377
00:48:17,674 --> 00:48:19,959
- there..didn't you?
- Yeah Grigore, yeah.

378
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:24,037
Well, I believe you are
about to discover two more.

379
00:48:36,763 --> 00:48:42,371
An out of the ground, formed
every beast of the field...

380
00:48:42,372 --> 00:48:45,878
To every bird of the sky.

381
00:48:46,427 --> 00:48:52,554
Forever the man called the demon creature
at last, it's name.

382
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:56,979
Valak.

383
00:48:58,305 --> 00:49:00,661
The defiler.

384
00:49:00,685 --> 00:49:02,565
The Profane.

385
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:05,060
The Marquis of Snakes.

386
00:49:14,881 --> 00:49:16,544
Sister.

387
00:49:20,066 --> 00:49:22,353
Sister Irene.

388
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:32,069
Sister Victoria's death
was a terrible tragedy for the convent...

389
00:49:32,194 --> 00:49:34,690
but we still feel her presence.

390
00:49:34,966 --> 00:49:38,174
She was the most devoted out of any of us.

391
00:49:40,816 --> 00:49:43,103
Excuse me, sister.

392
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,588
Sister Vic...

393
00:50:05,255 --> 00:50:08,991
Forgive us.
We are highly protective of our privacy.

394
00:50:09,015 --> 00:50:12,751
Some other sisters would prefer to not
speak to you, at all.

395
00:50:13,561 --> 00:50:16,324
We appreciate your willingness
to do so.

396
00:50:16,325 --> 00:50:21,237
Sister Oana, can you tell me
about the history of this abbey?

397
00:50:22,745 --> 00:50:26,170
It was built by a duke
in the Dark Ages.

398
00:50:27,868 --> 00:50:29,903
<i>The Duke of St. Carta.</i>

399
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:33,416
<i>He wrote countless texts
on witchcraft and rituals...</i>

400
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,978
in which to call
upon the forces of hell.

401
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:43,350
Hell used him to open a gateway, so that
an unspeakable evil would walk amongst us.

402
00:50:57,885 --> 00:51:00,169
But the church stormed the castle.

403
00:51:04,121 --> 00:51:08,367
They sealed the gateway,
using an ancient relic...

404
00:51:09,495 --> 00:51:12,596
Containing the blood of Jesus Christ.

405
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,011
The church claimed the
castle for their own...

406
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:23,711
and our perpetual praying began, to
secure the abbey and contain the evil.

407
00:51:23,735 --> 00:51:28,607
For centuries it worked,
and evil was keep at bay...

408
00:51:28,736 --> 00:51:31,311
until the bombs of war
shook the abbey...

409
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:35,594
and evil found another way
to open the gateway.

410
00:51:36,556 --> 00:51:42,431
Sister Oana,
last night in the chapel I saw a nun.

411
00:51:43,538 --> 00:51:49,184
She was, she felt anything but holy.

412
00:51:49,348 --> 00:51:51,636
Did you see her too?

413
00:51:52,113 --> 00:51:54,733
I've seen her stalking
the hallways at night.

414
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:57,122
We all have.

415
00:51:57,246 --> 00:51:59,838
She looks like us,
but she's not one of us.

416
00:51:59,842 --> 00:52:01,381
It's something unholy.

417
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:05,319
It takes on different forms to deceive us
and prey on our weaknesses.

418
00:52:05,343 --> 00:52:10,135
It appears as a nun so it could hide among
our clothes until it can corrupt us all.

419
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:13,564
I fear her presence means
the portal has opened again.

420
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:16,275
It means, Sister Victoria
commit the ultimate sin.

421
00:52:16,376 --> 00:52:18,050
Sister Oana.

422
00:52:20,812 --> 00:52:23,641
Sister Ruth is nearly finished
with her prayers.

423
00:52:24,518 --> 00:52:27,639
- It's time you turn to yours.
- Yes sister.

424
00:52:34,091 --> 00:52:37,340
- You haven't taken your vows yet?
- No.

425
00:52:37,664 --> 00:52:41,859
Then, this is not a place for you.
You need to leave, now.

426
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,525
She can't.

427
00:52:43,549 --> 00:52:47,212
The gates have closed.
You must stay until they open again.

428
00:52:47,213 --> 00:52:51,594
- When do they open?
- Sunrise, you must stay the night.

429
00:53:01,787 --> 00:53:04,071
Sister Irene.

430
00:53:16,728 --> 00:53:18,455
Good night, sister.

431
00:53:18,479 --> 00:53:21,652
- Sister, wait.
- Yes.

432
00:53:23,193 --> 00:53:26,064
Sister Victoria had this
in her possession when

433
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:29,096
she died. Do you happen
to know what it's for?

434
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,826
No.

435
00:53:35,214 --> 00:53:37,512
Now please, I must go pray.

436
00:54:13,676 --> 00:54:15,963
Where are you?

437
00:54:17,743 --> 00:54:22,268
You wont find another way in, Father.

438
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,415
Abbess?

439
00:54:36,313 --> 00:54:40,187
What is it that concerns you?

440
00:54:45,705 --> 00:54:51,729
I'm afraid..there is something very
wrong with this place, Abbess.

441
00:54:52,548 --> 00:54:58,553
Like many places in this world,
the abbey has a long history.

442
00:54:58,726 --> 00:55:03,606
Not all good, but we repent.

443
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:09,312
That nun..I found her, clutching
the key in her hands.

444
00:55:09,336 --> 00:55:11,106
What does it open, Abbess?

445
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:18,140
It's too late, Father.
Sister Irene is lost.

446
00:55:26,102 --> 00:55:27,805
Abbess?

447
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

448
00:56:23,656 --> 00:56:25,759
Sister Irene.

449
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:30,327
Mary points the way.

450
00:57:00,255 --> 00:57:01,586
Who are you?

451
00:57:59,095 --> 00:58:01,383
God save you.

452
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

453
00:58:26,271 --> 00:58:28,727
Sister please, come.

454
00:58:29,777 --> 00:58:31,772
Sister Oana?

455
01:00:02,673 --> 01:00:04,247
Oh God.

456
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

457
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Quiet.

458
01:01:44,186 --> 01:01:46,081
The evil grows stronger.

459
01:01:46,105 --> 01:01:48,729
Get your things and meet
me in the chapel, sister.

460
01:01:48,753 --> 01:01:51,214
Only prayer would get
us through the night.

461
01:01:51,614 --> 01:01:53,901
Go, leave.

462
01:01:55,765 --> 01:01:57,384
Now.

463
01:02:35,717 --> 01:02:37,520
Santa María, Madre de
Dios, ruega por nosotros

464
01:02:37,544 --> 01:02:39,661
pecadores, ahora y en la
hora de nuestra muerte.

465
01:02:40,814 --> 01:02:42,647
Hello?

466
01:02:42,671 --> 01:02:44,189
Dios Te salve, Maria. Llena eres

467
01:02:44,213 --> 01:02:45,800
de gracia: El Senor es contigo.

468
01:02:45,824 --> 01:02:48,957

now and at the hour of our death
Hail Mary, full of grace...

484
01:03:35,232 --> 01:03:37,728
How long have I been dead, Father?

485
01:03:39,925 --> 01:03:42,044
How long?

486
01:03:46,059 --> 01:03:47,385
Daniel?

487
01:03:48,478 --> 01:03:50,226
I'm sorry.

488
01:03:52,229 --> 01:03:54,397
Why didn't you help me?

489
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

490
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:25,463

now and at the hour of our death.

We need to pray, now!

497
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:44,455
And what ever happens,
what ever you may see or

498
01:04:44,479 --> 01:04:47,499
hear keep your eyes forward
and don't stop praying.

Hail Mary, full of grace;

DELIVERIES

508
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:06,964
"That's the door the nuns would enter
from to retrieve their supplies".

509
01:06:06,988 --> 01:06:09,774
"So they wouldn't have
to leave the castle".

510
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

511
01:07:22,553 --> 01:07:25,640
Holy Mother of God.

512
01:07:25,802 --> 01:07:27,495
Frenchy.

513
01:07:27,524 --> 01:07:29,811
Thought you could use some help.

514
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,625
Thank you.

515
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:38,336
But please, by all means.
Next time, do use the shotgun.

516
01:07:39,383 --> 01:07:42,423
I'm saving that for emergencies, Father.

517
01:07:42,548 --> 01:07:45,420
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with you.

518
01:07:45,513 --> 01:07:47,516

Among women

01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:05,309
The Mother of God...

524
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:09,360
The Mother of God, pray for us.

525
01:08:09,384 --> 01:08:11,110
Ave Maria

526
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:13,173
full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

527
01:08:13,731 --> 01:08:16,479
Among women because the fruit.

528
01:08:17,837 --> 01:08:21,135
The Mother of God Pray for us...

529
01:08:21,159 --> 01:08:23,491
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

530
01:08:24,876 --> 01:08:27,857
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with you.

531
01:08:27,881 --> 01:08:31,335
Benedicta Tu in mulieribus.

532
01:08:33,848 --> 01:08:36,052
Sister.

533
01:08:37,254 --> 01:08:39,542
Sister Irene.

534
01:08:41,128 --> 01:08:43,415
Father Burke.

535
01:08:50,343 --> 01:08:51,737
It's Father Burke.

536
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:53,865
He will help us.

537
01:08:53,889 --> 01:08:55,759
Sister.

538
01:09:03,604 --> 01:09:05,808
Sister Irene.

539
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:13,671
- Thank God, Father.
- Are you all right, sister?

540
01:09:14,097 --> 01:09:15,916
Frenchy?

541
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,609
What happened?

542
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:20,731
We've been praying, all of us together.

543
01:09:21,077 --> 01:09:26,032
Perpetual etheration, it's the only thing
that's been holding back the evil.

544
01:09:26,056 --> 01:09:27,856
Who's been praying?

545
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,163
All of us. The other nuns.

546
01:09:52,051 --> 01:09:53,878
They were here.

547
01:09:54,178 --> 01:09:56,943
They were praying with me,
when we're attacked.

548
01:09:59,387 --> 01:10:01,515
The nuns tried to warn me.

549
01:10:01,522 --> 01:10:04,501
- Visions.
- It felt so real.

550
01:10:55,631 --> 01:10:57,914
There's no one left.

551
01:11:00,779 --> 01:11:03,023
We have our answer, Father.

552
01:11:03,736 --> 01:11:07,556
As if there was any doubt,
before this place is no longer holy.

553
01:11:13,968 --> 01:11:15,333
Our Father.

554
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Father, what do we do?
Get my bag, sister.
Holy cross.
Put some holy water on this.

555
01:11:30,811 --> 01:11:33,392
- Here.
- Hurry! Please father, hurry.

556
01:11:35,535 --> 01:11:37,823
Put her down.
Cover its face.

557
01:11:40,905 --> 01:11:43,817
The Gods out, the demon in you...

558
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:48,941
In the name of the God, and the Father all
vanity and the power of the Holy Spirit.

559
01:11:48,965 --> 01:11:53,056
I ask this in the name
forefather, Jesus Christ.

560
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,214
Which is the Judge
all the living and the dead...

561
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:58,733
and the world of fire.

562
01:12:16,434 --> 01:12:19,223
That felt like an emergency.

563
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:22,865
We're too late.

564
01:12:23,489 --> 01:12:25,193
The evil is free.

565
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:26,918
No.

566
01:12:27,436 --> 01:12:31,322
For demon to enter our world,
it must possess a human soul.

567
01:12:31,953 --> 01:12:35,761
Sister Victoria must have been the last nun
in this Cloistered.

568
01:12:35,785 --> 01:12:38,037
- You know what you must do.
- I can't.

569
01:12:38,061 --> 01:12:40,865
Then not even God...

570
01:12:43,808 --> 01:12:46,041
It wasn't suicide.

571
01:12:47,193 --> 01:12:49,480
<i>It was a sacrifice...</i>

572
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:53,755
<i>so the evil wouldn't take her soul.</i>

573
01:12:55,557 --> 01:12:58,231
I did not understand what you just
said, but I ahh...

574
01:12:58,254 --> 01:13:02,485
Sounds like your investigation is complete.
So let's get out the here.

575
01:13:02,509 --> 01:13:06,051
- We can't just leave.
- Oh come on, why the hell not?

576
01:13:08,146 --> 01:13:12,377
We have to seal the gateway,
to contain the evil.

577
01:13:19,321 --> 01:13:21,524
The gateways is in the catacombs.

578
01:13:21,648 --> 01:13:26,692
But we can't close it,
without the relic, the blood of Christ.

579
01:13:27,058 --> 01:13:29,847
'Christ.' Jesus Christ?

580
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:33,635
Did the sisters tell you where it is?

581
01:13:33,759 --> 01:13:37,309
The Abbess was found dead
in the tunnel to the catacombs.

582
01:13:39,052 --> 01:13:41,103
I think I know where that tunnel is.

583
01:13:41,108 --> 01:13:44,738
Good, then that's where we look first.

584
01:13:44,762 --> 01:13:47,764
But Father, before we do...

585
01:13:49,129 --> 01:13:51,522
I'd like to take my vows.

586
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,954
Are you certain?

587
01:13:55,487 --> 01:13:57,690
My visions.

588
01:13:57,719 --> 01:14:02,935
I now know they are miracle of God and
I am ready to commit my life to him.

589
01:14:02,991 --> 01:14:05,779
That sister is a noble act.

590
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:08,068
It's a shame, but...

591
01:14:09,803 --> 01:14:15,147
By the authority entrusted to me,
and in the name of the church...

592
01:14:15,171 --> 01:14:17,459
I receive the vows you have taken.

593
01:14:20,195 --> 01:14:22,482
I earnestly commend you to God.

594
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:28,677
That your gift of self is made one,
with the sacrifice of the Eucharist...

595
01:14:28,759 --> 01:14:30,753
And might be brought to perfection.

596
01:14:30,982 --> 01:14:35,897
May the love of God,
unite you forever and ever.

597
01:14:36,747 --> 01:14:40,955
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

598
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:43,131
Amen.

599
01:15:00,722 --> 01:15:02,925
There's nothing here.

600
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:05,012
There has to be.

601
01:15:05,036 --> 01:15:08,041
They told me this key unlocked
the doors to the relic.

602
01:15:08,065 --> 01:15:10,353
That could be anywhere in the castle.

603
01:15:11,571 --> 01:15:15,892
It is here, don't you see, sister?

604
01:15:16,202 --> 01:15:17,822
What?

605
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:22,304
Mary points the way.

606
01:16:20,985 --> 01:16:23,272
The blood of Christ.

607
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:26,841
Holy SHIT.

608
01:16:27,603 --> 01:16:29,890
The Holys'.

609
01:16:37,547 --> 01:16:44,126
Only a true bride of Christ
can wield something so sacred.

610
01:16:49,408 --> 01:16:50,773
Wait.

611
01:16:51,502 --> 01:16:53,297
What is it?

612
01:16:53,321 --> 01:16:57,037
Shouldn't we say a prayer or
something first?

613
01:16:57,059 --> 01:17:00,517
There's a time for prayer,
and a time for action, son.

614
01:17:00,528 --> 01:17:02,584
Now is the time for action.

615
01:17:02,608 --> 01:17:06,373
Also still feels like a time for prayer
as well, Father.

616
01:17:15,605 --> 01:17:17,684
"Finit hic, Deo."

617
01:17:18,192 --> 01:17:20,202
"God ends here."

618
01:17:31,732 --> 01:17:35,478
We need to search everywhere
to find the gateway.

619
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

620
01:18:51,738 --> 01:18:54,690
Sister Irene. This way.

621
01:19:00,251 --> 01:19:02,414
Hello?

622
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Sister Irene.
Sister.

623
01:20:27,642 --> 01:20:29,681
Irene.

624
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:53,122
Lord Jesus, in the holy name...

625
01:20:53,644 --> 01:20:57,390
I bind all evil spirits to this fire.

626
01:20:58,084 --> 01:21:01,958
Protect us from evil
with your holy light.

627
01:21:24,795 --> 01:21:28,169
Frenchy, help me.

628
01:21:31,121 --> 01:21:33,031
Of course.

629
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

630
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

631
01:22:38,315 --> 01:22:41,143
Notre Père qui es aux cieux

632
01:22:41,171 --> 01:22:43,275
Que ton nom soit sanctifi

633
01:22:43,299 --> 01:22:45,502
Que ton r gne vienne

634
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:49,256
Que ta volont soit faite sur la terre
comme Au ciel

635
01:22:49,826 --> 01:22:51,988
Amen.

636
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
You failed.
Just u failed everyone in your life.

637
01:23:23,349 --> 01:23:28,178
Tomorrow, a village will
be missing, you idiot.

638
01:23:28,188 --> 01:23:31,894
You should have kept dreaming
when you had the chance, Frenchman.

639
01:23:32,427 --> 01:23:34,421
I am French-Canadian.

640
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:45,184
Run.

641
01:23:46,635 --> 01:23:48,381
Frenchy!

642
01:23:51,205 --> 01:23:53,405
No!

643
01:24:08,714 --> 01:24:12,699
Sister... Sister Irene.

644
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

645
01:25:26,741 --> 01:25:30,650
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

646
01:27:31,878 --> 01:27:33,705
Come on.

647
01:28:04,354 --> 01:28:08,170
I hope you dont mind,
is called the 'kiss of life'.

648
01:28:09,129 --> 01:28:11,858
Just call that way.
It's just, it's not really...

649
01:28:11,882 --> 01:28:15,355
Frenchy, what's your real name?

650
01:28:16,017 --> 01:28:17,591
Maurice.

651
01:28:18,553 --> 01:28:21,355
Thank you for saving my life, Maurice.

652
01:28:22,183 --> 01:28:23,637
You're welcome.

653
01:28:58,434 --> 01:29:00,145
We should get going.

654
01:29:00,169 --> 01:29:03,751
At your hands O'Lord, we humbly
deliver your servance...

655
01:29:04,174 --> 01:29:06,214
the nuns of St. Carta.

656
01:29:06,963 --> 01:29:10,168
They served You in this life
with strength and faith.

657
01:29:10,707 --> 01:29:13,790
Deliver them now from every evil.

658
01:29:13,799 --> 01:29:17,803
And let them live with you
in perfect grace forever.

659
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:20,177
Amen.

660
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:23,458
I thought this ground
wasn't holy anymore.

661
01:29:26,889 --> 01:29:29,176
It is now.

662
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:33,358
Will you stay on in Biertan?

663
01:29:33,381 --> 01:29:38,174
I think I have live feel of Romania.
My father was a tomato farmer.

664
01:29:39,408 --> 01:29:41,695
Maybe I'll try that for while.

665
01:29:42,129 --> 01:29:45,238
Sounds little boring for a
world traveler like you.

666
01:29:45,262 --> 01:29:47,089
Certainly hope so.

667
01:30:02,803 --> 01:30:05,410
20 YEARS LATER

668
01:30:05,973 --> 01:30:11,429
An exorcism can be very dangerous not only
for the victim, but for anyone in the room.

669
01:30:11,452 --> 01:30:14,974
Take Maurice Theriault.
His friends called him Frenchy.

670
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:18,608
He was a French Canadian farmer.
Nothing more than a third grade education.

671
01:30:18,632 --> 01:30:21,253
After he was possessed...

672
01:30:22,888 --> 01:30:25,119
He spoke some of the best
Latin I had ever heard.

673
01:30:25,143 --> 01:30:30,299
And like that, an upside down cross
started to appear from within his body.

674
01:30:30,323 --> 01:30:34,148
Which brings me to the three stages
of demonic activities.

675
01:30:34,199 --> 01:30:35,608
Infestation...

676
01:30:36,093 --> 01:30:37,648
Oppression...

677
01:30:37,672 --> 01:30:39,538
Possession.
