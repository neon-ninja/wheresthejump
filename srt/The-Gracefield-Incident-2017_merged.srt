1
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,752
- Do you have
to film everything?

2
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:21,520
- Yup.
- Describing...

3
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,422
You're filming everything,
you're describing.

4
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:26,191
- That's his journal. I want him
to remember everything.

5
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,659
- His journal.
You don't even know

6
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,461
if it's a boy
or a girl yet.

7
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,764
- Yeah. But, you know,

8
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,700
we trust the first
ultrason, it's a boy.

9
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:37,236
So tell us.

10
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,071
- Where are we going?
- Yup.

11
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:41,306
- We're going to the hospital

12
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,742
to get our second ultrason

13
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:46,145
and confirm the sex of the baby.

14
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:48,447
This little guy.
- Yeah, little guy.

15
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:52,117
- And we're happy,
we're excited.

16
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,153
Hi.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hi. You're gonna be
editing all this, right?
- Of course.
- All right, so your turn now.
Tell me how you feel,
future dad.
- I'm just really grateful

18
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:06,565
that our kid
is gonna be healthy.

19
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,534
- Matt! Watch out!

20
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,838
- Oh my god!

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,207
Oh! Jess!

22
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,176
Jess! Oh my god!
- Matt!

23
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:18,644
- Oh my god!

24
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:21,146
You got the phone?
Where's the phone?

25
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:24,616
Call 911! Call 911!
Oh my god!

26
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:28,287
- Oh, my baby.

27
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,798
<i> You're gonna be</i>
<i> editing all this, right?</i>

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,100
- <i> Of course.</i>

29
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,621
- I hate night shifts.

30
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:38,323
Did your boss say how much he's
charging us for the weekend?

31
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,392
- Free. Yeah, we have
the cabin to ourselves

32
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,394
for the entire
weekend. Yeah.

33
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,430
He want us to have a good
time before I get back to work.

34
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,633
- That's nice.
I can't believe we're leaving

35
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,735
for a whole weekend.
- It's been so long.

36
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:52,237
- I want us to have fun
and laugh and party.

37
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,805
- Party.
- And be ourselves again.

38
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,541
- Yeah.
- Okay.

39
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:57,843
- You didn't tell anyone
about this, did you?

40
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,711
- No. Why?
- Okay.

41
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,214
I want to make a little surprise
video for Joe's birthday.

42
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:03,615
- Oh. You gonna have
enough time

43
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,217
to put it together
before we leave?

44
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:07,186
- Yeah, if I work
all night on it.

45
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,887
- Okay, well don't work
too hard

46
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,223
'cause I need you to have
your energy this weekend.

47
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:13,358
- Oh, yeah?
- I got the news from Joe.

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,395
All is in order, we can start
trying to have a baby again.

49
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,730
Okay? So, I need you
to have your energy,

50
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:22,434
all of your energy.
I gotta go to work. Bye.

51
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:25,237
Oh, don't forget, you're
picking us up at 11:00, okay?

52
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,838
- Okay.
- Love you!

53
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,507
- Love you!

54
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,654
<i> - Good morning,</i>
<i> you're listening</i>

55
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,956
<i> to the morning show</i>
<i> with me, Dan Hitchcock.</i>

56
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,859
<i> Okay, the weather.</i>
<i> Now, temperatures will today</i>

57
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:56,328
<i> move into the low 80s</i>
<i> and we'll have sunshine</i>

58
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,463
<i> and a few clouds</i>
<i> for most of the day.</i>

59
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,799
<i> With wind from</i>
<i> 10 to 20 miles an hour.</i>

60
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,302
<i> Now, as for</i>
<i> the long weekend ahead,</i>

61
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,538
<i> well, sunny with a few clouds</i>

62
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,641
<i> and temperatures are going to</i>
<i> move down into the lower 70s.</i>

63
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,711
<i> But still,</i>
<i> a perfect weekend to get away.</i>

64
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,981
<i> Now, after the break, we'll</i>
<i> talk about why there's a...</i>

65
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,916
<i> ... you should be taking</i>

66
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,852
<i> an evening stroll</i>
<i> over the long weekend.</i>

67
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,990
<i> - Earlier this morning</i>
<i> an American satellite</i>

68
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,459
<i> was destroyed by what</i>
<i> authorities are calling</i>

69
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,428
<i> an unidentified object.</i>

70
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,030
<i> Images taken by the satellite</i>
<i> itself moments</i>

71
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,900
<i> before it was destroyed seem</i>
<i> to indicate that a collision</i>

72
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:38,370
<i> between the satellite</i>
<i> and the object was the cause.</i>

73
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,472
<i> Mainly over the province</i>
<i> of Quebec, Canada...</i>

74
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:41,873
- Ready Teddy?
All right, let's go!

75
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,775
We're running late,
buddy.

76
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:46,411
<i> - ... and to report</i>
<i> any unusual sightings.</i>

77
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,690
- Hey Joe!
- <i> You're late Matt.</i>

78
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,392
- I know, it's Teddy's fault.

79
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:01,993
<i> - I think he disagrees</i>
<i> with you.</i>

80
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,129
- I'll be there in a minute.
- <i> Yeah, right.</i>

81
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,064
- What's up, birthday boy?

82
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,400
- A weekend away from the
hospital, that's what's up.

83
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,135
Keep your eyes
on the road, man.

84
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,771
- Nice haircut, doc.
- I hate it!

85
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,806
When we get back
to the hospital,

86
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,541
I'm gonna show you
something real sweet.

87
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,976
Check it out!
- What is it?

88
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,544
- Hold on, hold on.

89
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,779
- Come on, what is it?

90
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,647
- Check it out!

91
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,982
- Holy shit!

92
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,717
- Yeah baby.
- No way!

93
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,552
Are you kidding me?
You finally bought it?

94
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,121
- Yeah. It costs me
a small fortune,

95
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:31,123
but I got everything
i wanted. I got lights

96
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,525
for the night shots,
i got everything man.

97
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:37,529
- Wow! Check it out!
Is it recording right now?

98
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,030
- Yup.
Matt, I'm telling you,

99
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,565
I'm ready for
any eventuality now.

100
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,503
- Hold on.
Hi, honey!

101
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,838
- Who's the girl your brother's
bringing, Jess?

102
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,607
His new girlfriend?

103
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,909
- Yeah, I think so.
I don't know much about her,

104
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,845
she's going to school with him.
- Wait. Wow.

105
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,014
- Are you gonna film like that
on the weekend?

106
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,983
- I'm just trying
to make a souvenir here.

107
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,718
- Of my ass?

108
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,853
- You know your nurse outfit
excites me.

109
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,523
- You know you're not bringing
that thing into the bedroom.

110
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,624
- Come on!

111
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,925
- Where's your brother?

112
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,760
Did you tell him
to meet us here?

113
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,462
- Yeah, I did.

114
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,030
- Your brother is a mess.

115
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,199
- What? Is that Trey
and his new girlfriend?

116
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:15,801
- What do you think
you're doing?

117
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,469
Give me that.

118
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,504
- Hey.
- Hi, I'm Jess.

119
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,440
- Julia.
- This is my husband Matt.

120
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,742
- Hey, nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

121
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,577
- What up, Trey?

122
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,878
- What's up, Matt?

123
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,547
Hey, nice to see you, Joe.

124
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:29,781
- Yeah, it's been a while.

125
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,616
- Stop, my god.

126
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,886
- Matt, how long will
it take us to get there?

127
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,855
- Gracefield is about
five hours.

128
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,024
- Five hours? I thought
it was closer than that!

129
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,792
- Five hours? You know what?

130
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,894
Just wake me up
when we get there, tron.

131
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,963
- Why are you
calling him like that?

132
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,200
- He called him that because
Matt's a video game editor.

133
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:50,235
- Oh, okay.
- That's not really why.

134
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,870
Come on,
show it to her, tron.

135
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,839
- Trey! He's driving.

136
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,707
- Come on, man.
You can't see anything...

137
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,809
- I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it.

138
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,545
- She'll like it, man.
I'm telling you.

139
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,615
- Don't do it, Matt.
- You really want to see it?

140
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:06,017
You really want to see it?
All right, I'm doing it.

141
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,986
- You know, Trey,
this is all your fault.

142
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,187
- What is it?

143
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,655
- I'm filming this.

144
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,924
I got this. Oh god!

145
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,795
- Oh my god!

146
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,999
This is disgusting!
- She dropped it in the trunk.

147
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,635
- What? What?
What's going on?

148
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:24,870
- Shit!

149
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,538
- Teddy's licking it.

150
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,540
- What do you mean
she dropped my eye?

151
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,709
- Teddy's licking it.

152
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,078
- Wow!
- Oh, man!

153
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,113
- Matt's prosthetic eye.

154
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,986
- Trey,
can I have it back, now?

155
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,156
- Teddy, don't swallow it!

156
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,679
- Yo, does anyone have
any reception?

157
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,713
- Nope!

158
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,081
- Negative.

159
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,883
- I lost reception
like an hour ago.

160
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,318
- Me too.
- God, Matt.

161
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,287
Why is it taking so long?
Are you lost?

162
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,988
- No. I'm not lost.

163
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,723
We'll be there soon, okay?
- Relax.

164
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,926
- Matt, whose cabin is this,
by the way?

165
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,761
- My boss.

166
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,830
- Please ask him why
he bought a cabin that far.

167
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,799
- 'Cause he traps, Trey.
- He what?

168
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,101
- He's a trapper.
He captures animals.

169
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,270
- No, no, Matt,
tell him the real reason

170
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,873
why your boss bought
a cabin out here.

171
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,875
- That's a good story.
- Why?

172
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,144
'Cause my boss has been
trying to capture bigfoot.

173
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,914
- What did he just say?
- Sasquatch!

174
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,749
- Your boss
is a kooky little man.

175
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,619
- It's a hoax, that's what
it is. But it's cool.

176
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,188
- You'd be surprise how many
people believe in that shit.

177
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,324
And he does! And he's been
trying to capture it.

178
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:55,160
- Nobody believes in that stuff.
Your boss, he freaks me out.

179
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,828
- Hey guys,
i think we're here.

180
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,863
- Ah, finally!

181
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,833
- What kind of cabin
has a gate like this?

182
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,869
- I was expecting a shack
with one room and no toilet.

183
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,872
- Well, if it's true,
I'm sleeping in the car.

184
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:08,940
- Come on, Liz!

185
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,375
- Shotgun!

186
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,310
- "No trespassing"?

187
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,079
- Are we sure this is it?

188
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,814
- I hope so.

189
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:19,117
'Cause if it's not,
we're definitely lost.

190
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,186
- That's reassuring.

191
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,388
- Did he say we were lost?

192
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,990
- Yeah, probably.

193
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,958
- Matt, you do realize

194
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,761
how crazy your boss is for
believing in this shit, right?

195
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,364
- You got that right.
- A bigfoot, come on!

196
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:35,200
- Yeah, man, he even told me
he heard one a while back.

197
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,769
- Yeah, your boss is definitely
out of his mind.

198
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:40,271
Oh, and paranoid too!

199
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,107
- So, Julia and i
are getting

200
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,109
the biggest room,
that's just for sure.

201
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,710
- You guys are getting
the couch.

202
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,345
- No way, man! Are you serious?

203
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,147
- Hell yeah, I am.

204
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,782
- Man, I'm not getting
the couch.

205
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,717
- Yo! Guys!
Check this out!

206
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,286
- That is sick!

207
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:58,189
- This place looks amazing!

208
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,991
- Yeah. You're still getting
the couch, Trey.

209
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,960
- That's bullshit. Come on!
Don't do that.

210
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:04,262
- You're so getting the couch.
- - No, no, no.

211
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,765
- No, I'm gonna go there before
you. You know it.

212
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,900
- You're the youngest,
that's why you get the couch.

213
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,669
- Matt, why are you
locking the doors?

214
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,804
- Give a head start to my wife.
- What?

215
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,706
- Ready? Go, go, go!

216
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,107
Grab the best room!

217
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,143
- Go, go, go. Go, Liz!
Go, go, go.

218
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,878
- That's not cool,
Matt, come on!

219
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,880
- Hey, oh, slow down!

220
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:24,049
- Looks like you got
the couch to me, Trey.

221
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,151
Go, go, go.

222
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,286
- Catch up, Teddy,
come on!

223
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,322
- Wow!
This place is huge!

224
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,857
- Bring you ass, quick!

225
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,693
- Holy shit!

226
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:38,096
Look at this place.
This is unbelievable.

227
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,899
- What's wrong with this guy?
There's a surveillance room.

228
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,000
- Matt, I got it!

229
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,002
- Jess, where are you?

230
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,737
- Right here.
- Right where?

231
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,305
- Upstairs.

232
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:50,875
- No, no, two separate beds?
Definitely not.

233
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,311
- You guys are too young
to sleep together anyway.

234
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,313
- Yeah, yeah,
really funny, Matt.

235
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,715
You should be a comedian.

236
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,316
- We need a double bed.

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Jess?
Oh, oh, oh, tell me
this is our room.
- Hey, Trey, how's the couch?

238
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,827
- Shut up, man.

239
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,329
- Oh, shit!

240
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,767
You have to stop doing that.

241
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,368
- You want me
to stop doing...

242
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,337
- Whoa, whoa. No, no.
- ... that?

243
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,172
- That, you can keep
doing all weekend.

244
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,241
- Yeah? You like that?

245
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,811
- Yeah. I've been waiting for
this weekend for a long time.

246
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,114
- I know, me too.
It's gonna be nice.

247
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,782
- Guys! Come outside!

248
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,017
- Hey, Joe? Heads up.

249
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,419
- Guys, check this out.

250
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,488
- There's a hot tub. Yes!

251
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,259
- Crazy.

252
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,061
- It doesn't get
any better than this.

253
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,963
- I think I can die, now.

254
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,999
Man, I'm telling you,
this is exactly what I needed.

255
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:51,002
No worries, eating,
drinking, and...

256
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,771
- And what?

257
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,773
- And eating again, baby.
Just eating again.

258
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,341
- Like the sound of that.
- Yeah.

259
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,909
- No cameras allowed, tough.

260
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,511
- Dinner's ready.

261
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:02,180
- Oh, man, I'm so hungry.

262
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,915
Thanks, babe.

263
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,550
- To an amazing weekend...

264
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,418
With my best friends!

265
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,421
- Cheers!

266
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,823
- I'm getting drunk.

267
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,191
- Cheers, love.

268
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,492
- It's yours, right there.
Ready?

269
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,927
- Come on, Matt.

270
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,398
- Way to go, way to go!

271
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,567
Come on, buddy, drink it.
Drink it.

272
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,969
- Chug, chug, chug!

273
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,338
- Chug, chug, chug!

274
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,813
- And there we have Jess,

275
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,447
the luckiest poker player
in gracefield.

276
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,216
- She's always winning.

277
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:41,352
- And here is my wife
and her sexy poker face.

278
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,356
Oh, what a lucky bastard.

279
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,927
- That's how
they study biology today.

280
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,229
- At least he got the couch.
- Leave him alone.

281
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,164
- Julia. Julia?

282
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,868
Come on in, baby, the water's
so good. And, well...

283
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,137
You know,
i have a surprise.

284
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,839
- Really?
- All right, I'm coming.

285
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,407
- Trey, your sister
is gonna come out.

286
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,375
- Joe! Who cares?

287
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,511
- Sorry, everybody, but I'm not
getting my bathing suit.

288
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,880
- Don't be sorry.

289
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,315
- Did you see that?

290
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,250
- Yeah. Is she for real?

291
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:15,053
- Whoa!
- What? I... I mean, I didn't...

292
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,121
- Look.
- What?

293
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,957
- Whoa. What is that?

294
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,191
- What is what?

295
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,326
- That!

296
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,594
- Whoa.

297
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:24,229
- Guys, are you seeing this?

298
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,331
- Yeah.
- What is it?

299
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,633
- This thing is getting
bigger and bigger.

300
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,969
- Yo, what is that?

301
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,071
- It's coming
straight at us!

302
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,074
- Watch out!

303
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,876
- Whoa!
- Oh my god!

304
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,377
- Shit.

305
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,546
- Are you all right?
- Did you feel that?

306
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,349
- It crashed right behind the
house. Guys, are you all right?

307
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,284
- Fine!
- Jess, are you okay?

308
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,286
- That was...
- Joe, grab your camera!

309
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,221
- Yeah, I'll meet you
in the front.

310
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,923
- No, guys, no. Matt, no!

311
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,524
- We'll be right back!
- Wait up!

312
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,595
- This is so cool!

313
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,364
- This is insane!

314
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,599
- I'm so glad
i brought the light.

315
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,568
- This is unreal. Make sure
you record everything

316
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,436
because nobody
is gonna believe us.

317
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,473
- Yeah, I got this. Hold on.
Let me just set up here.

318
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,108
- I'm recording
with my camera too.

319
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,110
- What camera?
- Never mind, never mind.

320
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:15,146
- That's what the red light in
your eye is all about, isn't it?

321
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,148
- No. No, it's not.
Come on, let's go!

322
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,250
- Yo, where is it?
- Come on!

323
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,086
Just put some clothes on!
- What is it? I wanna see it!

324
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,222
- Let's go, he's drunk.
- Where are we going?

325
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,357
- You stay here, all right?
Get you clothes on

326
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,326
and make sure you don't
lose sight of us.

327
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,561
- Let's go! He's just trying
to impress his girlfriend.

328
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,398
- I wanna go with you!
- It has to be somewhere close.

329
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,533
- We should see lights
or something, right?

330
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,102
- Talk about a satellite that
was destroyed this morning.

331
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,238
- You think this could be
a part of it?

332
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,340
- Maybe. We should
found out pretty soon.

333
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,042
They said they were
expecting some debris

334
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,044
to fall back to earth.

335
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,979
- Best birthday weekend ever!

336
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,249
Which way do you want to go?

337
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:54,385
- Let's try this way.
Follow me.

338
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,155
Watch you steps.

339
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,557
My boss might have set
some traps around here.

340
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,260
- Seriously? Your boss
and his hunt for bigfoot?

341
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,395
That's pretty sick, too.

342
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,970
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- What?

343
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,505
- Where is Trey?
Trey?

344
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,079
- Trey?

345
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,447
Why doesn't he answer?

346
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,515
- Yo, Matt,
we went way too far.

347
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,250
- Trey?

348
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,991
Trey? Trey?

349
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,459
- Yeah, yeah, I'm right here.

350
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,095
- What's wrong with you?
Answer us.

351
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,497
Hey, Joe! You know what?
You stay here, I'm gonna-

352
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,632
- whoa, hold on, hold on.
What are you saying?

353
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,768
- You stay here,
I'm gonna go check it out

354
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,270
a little bit further in.
It has to be somewhere.

355
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,239
Keep your light on
so I can see you.

356
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,607
- Just don't go too deep.

357
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,242
- We have to find this thing.

358
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,211
- Just don't go too far.
All right Matt?

359
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,312
- Yeah.

360
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,260
- What was that?

361
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,195
What was that?

362
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,563
Oh, come on.

363
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,133
Matt! Come on!

364
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,468
Look, man.
I can't see you anymore.

365
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,570
You should backtrack, come on!

366
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,439
We'll come back tomorrow.

367
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,674
- Hold on,
just a little bit more.

368
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,315
Oh my god!

369
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,785
Joe! I see something!

370
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:37,522
There's a light,
about 50 feet in front of me.

371
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,757
- Hold on.
Hold on.

372
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,827
Trey! Trey! Are you there?

373
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,563
- Yeah, yeah,
I'm right here.

374
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,331
- Matt thinks he's got it.

375
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,500
Really? No way!

376
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,302
No, no, listen to me.

377
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,304
You stay there, I'm gonna go
check it out.

378
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,672
- Are you kidding me, Joe?

379
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,641
Holy shit!

380
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:59,477
Joe!
I found it!

381
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,578
- Really?

382
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,349
I'm coming!

383
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,785
- Oh my god.

384
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,587
- Matt, where are you?

385
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,222
- Hurry up, Joe!

386
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,291
You won't believe this!

387
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,393
- Keep talking.
Where are you?

388
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,228
- Right here.
Right here, Joe.

389
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,737
I told you! I told you
we were gonna find this thing.

390
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:30,208
- Oh, what... what is this?

391
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,243
- Look at the size of it!

392
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,114
- Can you see what it is?

393
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,216
- No, it's too deep.

394
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,184
It's really down there.

395
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,719
- Really?
- Yeah, hold on.

396
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,488
Let me try to get it,
all right?

397
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,256
- What? You don't know
what's in there.

398
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,458
- Stop it.
You're such a pussy.

399
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,497
It's kind of cold.

400
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,533
I feel something.
- Ah!

401
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57,869
- What are you doing?
Why are you backing up?

402
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:01,172
- I don't know, you said
you felt something, I...

403
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,307
- Come on, you're scaring me.
Give me some light.

404
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,642
Come on, Joe!

405
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,919
I think I got it.

406
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,624
It's pretty big too.

407
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,569
- Holy shit!

408
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:34,505
I've never seen
anything like it!

409
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,941
- Look at this, man!
- What the hell is it?

410
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,910
- Looks like some kind
of meteorite.

411
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:41,579
- That has nothing to do with
the satellite. Is it hot?

412
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,314
- No, it's freezing.

413
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,448
- Is it heavy?

414
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,284
- Do you want to hold it?

415
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,486
- No.
- Why are you scare?

416
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,955
- No, it's all right.
I just don't want to touch it.

417
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,291
- Come on, Joe. It's a rock.
It's like lava.

418
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,359
Holy shit!

419
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,528
- Hey!
What are you doing here?

420
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,697
We told you--
- you gotta let me touch it.

421
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,233
- What the hell is wrong
with you? You have amnesia?

422
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,535
- Dude, you're not the one
standing alone in the dark.

423
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,571
I was freezing
my balls out there.

424
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:09,340
- How are we gonna get back
to the cabin now, huh?

425
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,709
- Relax, it's okay, the house
is like right... there.

426
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,611
Oh, shit.
- Yeah. Right, where?

427
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,379
- It was more
or less right there.

428
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,747
- What were you
thinking, Trey?

429
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,616
- The house moved, jackass.

430
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,984
- What a stupid move!

431
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,586
- Come on, let's try this way.

432
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,321
- I'm sure it's that way, okay?

433
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,556
- Yeah, you better be right.

434
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,359
Jess!

435
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,660
- Liz!

436
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,400
We're definitely close,
i can feel it.

437
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,704
- Ah, shit! I think I dropped
my phone out there.

438
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,906
- Sorry, but we're not
going back.

439
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,574
- Oh, shit.

440
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,009
- Guys, guys.
Stop, stop, stop.

441
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,877
- What? What is it?

442
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,380
- You know what? I think
we should just wait here.

443
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,616
I mean, we don't
wanna go too deep.

444
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,751
I'm sure in a few minutes,
the girls gonna come

445
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,886
and look for us, right?
- Yeah, you're probably right.

446
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,822
'Cause if we're going
in the wrong direction,

447
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,590
we are not gonna hear
the girls yelling.

448
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,592
- Exactly.
So, let's wait here.

449
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,893
- Yeah.

450
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,830
Liz!

451
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,699
- Whoa!

452
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,702
What was that, Matt?

453
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:14,038
- What the hell was that?
- Dude, I don't know.

454
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,706
- I'm not--
- shhh! Shhh!

455
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,041
- I heard something--
- shhh!

456
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,647
- You guys
see anything?

457
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,783
I can't see anything.

458
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,885
- What kind of animal
sounds like that?

459
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,757
- Matt!
- Jess!

460
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,793
- I think it was Jess.

461
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,995
- That scream didn't
sound like Jess to me!

462
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,299
- Joe. Joe!
- What?

463
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,801
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- Matt, no!

464
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,870
- Give me your camera,
I'll use the light.

465
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:48,005
- Just stick to the plan
and stay here.

466
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,308
- I think the girls
are looking for us.

467
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,376
I'll be right back.
You guys stay here, okay?

468
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:55,313
- Come on!
Are you out of your mind?

469
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,416
Let's just wait here.
Matt! Matt!

470
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,367
- Jess!

471
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,586
No, no, stay on!

472
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

473
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,645
- Matt! What happened?

474
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,814
Matt!
- Joe!

475
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,517
- Trey, follow me. Come on.
Matt, where are you?

476
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,885
- I need some help!

477
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,020
- Matt!
- Joe, over here.

478
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,789
- Holy shit, what happened?

479
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,924
- I got caught in one
of his frickin' traps.

480
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,926
- Hold on, hold on. Trey?
- Right here.

481
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,995
- Matt?
What was it?

482
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,664
- I didn't see it but it got
really close to me.

483
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,967
It was walking all around me.
- What was walking around?

484
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:24,568
- It was probably hungry
or something.

485
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,036
- What? Hungry?

486
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,873
What the hell are we dealing
with here?

487
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:32,610
- Listen!

488
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,512
- What?
- Listen.

489
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:36,046
- What?

490
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:43,154
- It sounds like my dog.

491
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:44,755
Teddy!

492
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,057
- Matt.
That wasn't Teddy!

493
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,961
- Ted!

494
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,697
Get over here, Teddy!

495
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,834
- Sounds like he's hurt.

496
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,605
Shit. Trey, hold this.
Hold this.

497
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,074
- What? What are you doing?
- We're gonna go get him.

498
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,610
- Get him?
- What? You gotta be kidding me.

499
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,546
What about that sound
we just heard?

500
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:10,548
- Every noise gets amplified,
we're in the woods.

501
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,850
- You want me to believe
that that shit we heard

502
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,718
was some kind of little
squirrel screaming?

503
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,154
- You want me to leave Teddy?
He might get struck

504
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,123
in one of those traps.
You stay here.

505
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,492
Joe, come with me.
- Matt, where are we going?

506
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:24,128
- Keep shining the light.
- Matt, you gotta slow down.

507
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,863
- Teddy!
- You gotta slow down.

508
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,632
- Teddy, where are you?
- Matt, slow down!

509
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,768
Matt! I can't keep up with you.

510
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:33,971
Holy shit!

511
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,007
No way,
he's not in there!

512
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,576
- Teddy!

513
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:40,511
Why the hell
did he go in there?

514
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:42,947
- I'm not sure
i wanna find out.

515
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,485
- Teddy!

516
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:53,224
- Was is wrong with him?

517
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,160
- He sounds scared.

518
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,828
- Scared of what?

519
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,530
- I don't know.

520
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,600
- Where are you going?

521
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:04,935
- I'm going in.
- I'm not going in there.

522
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:07,771
- Hey, I'm not leaving
Teddy here. Okay?

523
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:10,207
You brought that camera and
that light here for something.

524
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,943
- Oh, great, now the night
vision's on.

525
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,278
- Are you coming?

526
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,715
Teddy!

527
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,127
It's sounds like
he's crying.

528
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,697
- Dogs don't cry like that.

529
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,800
Matt, let's go!

530
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,003
- Shhh.
- What?

531
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,681
- Teddy?

532
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,226
Teddy!

533
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,164
- Matt, hold on.
What is that?

534
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,714
- Matt, I say we go.

535
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,089
- Hold on.
- Let's go!

536
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,225
- Teddy!

537
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,744
- What is that?

538
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,247
What is that?

539
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,883
- What the hell is this?

540
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,154
What is it?

541
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,691
- It's Trey's cell phone.
- What?

542
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Yeah.
I'm pretty sure it's his.
How the hell
did it get here?

543
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:17,801
- Oh my god.

544
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,943
Oh, shit!

545
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,932
Oh, shit!

546
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:51,669
- Go, go, go!

547
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,740
Come, come, come.

548
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,143
- What was that?

549
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,365
We gotta go.
We gotta go!

550
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:24,902
Let's get out of here.

551
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:26,837
- Wait, wait, wait.

552
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,006
- Is it gone?
- Can you see it?

553
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:30,441
Can you see it?
- No.

554
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,811
- I think it's safe to go.

555
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,713
- Let's go.

556
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,799
- Joe!
Joe, what are you doing?

557
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,902
Come on, let's go!

558
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,316
Don't move.

559
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,390
Shhh, shhh.

560
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,888
- Is it following us?

561
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,089
- I don't know!

562
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,857
Keep going. Keep going.

563
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,862
- Joe!
- Wait, wait, wait.

564
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,334
- Matt! We're here!

565
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,836
- Julia?
- It's the girls.

566
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:07,871
- Liz?
- Joe, are you okay?

567
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:11,575
- Hey! Don't say anything
to the girls.

568
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:14,111
You have to stay calm,
we don't want them to panic.

569
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:16,513
- Okay, sure, whatever.
- Joe, are you okay?

570
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,215
- Over here!
- Wait, wait, wait.

571
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:20,184
- Where have you been?
- What's going on?

572
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,952
- Stop it. Stop screaming!
- What?

573
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,587
- Are you all right?
- Matt?

574
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:26,256
- I think I just shit my pants.
- Is Matt okay?

575
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,225
- Trey, hold on.
- Yeah, yeah, he's good.

576
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:30,360
- Did you guys find it?
- Yeah, we did.

577
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:32,529
But we should probably
get back to the cabin now.

578
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,264
- Why?
- I'm not staying here.

579
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,999
- What's going on?
- There's something...

580
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,068
In the woods.
- Like an animal? What's...

581
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,037
- We're in the woods,
what did you expect?

582
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:42,973
- Yeah, but don't worry.
It was just a little scream.

583
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,942
- A scream?
- Yeah, bigfoot in a cave.

584
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,946
- Is this a joke?
- No, this is serious.

585
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:51,448
We gotta get our stuff,
we gotta back up and leave now.

586
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,217
- We're leaving tonight?
We just got here.

587
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:55,519
- I think it's safer not
to hit the roads tonight.

588
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,188
- What are you talking about?
- Everybody stays in the cabin.

589
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,957
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

590
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,292
- I agree with Matt,
we shouldn't leave if it's dark.

591
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,061
- What the hell?
No, we leave now!

592
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,029
- Joe, can you calm down?
Nobody's hurt and

593
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,131
you're overreacting as usual.
- Whatever!

594
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:11,501
- Teddy ran away, Jess.
- I know, he was acting weird.

595
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:14,204
My phone
won't stop recording.

596
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,506
- Trey's cell phone
was doing the same thing.

597
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,475
It's probably
because of this.

598
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,979
- Look at this thing.

599
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:23,447
- It's crazy, isn't it?

600
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,616
- Matt, can I talk
to you, please?

601
00:31:25,618 --> 00:31:27,484
- Yeah, give me a minute.

602
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,419
- Should I be worried?

603
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,521
- No, I'm sure there's
nothing to worry about

604
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:34,024
but let me try to find out
what happened back there.

605
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,193
- Okay.
I'll get the bath ready.

606
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,629
Hey, girls!
Check this out!

607
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:40,964
- What's wrong with you?
Why aren't we leaving tonight?

608
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:44,167
- Why do you think it took
so long to get here? I got lost.

609
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,136
- What?
- Yes. We only have enough gas

610
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,605
to make it to the first
gas station and I'm not sure

611
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:51,642
I can find my way in the middle
of the night. If we leave

612
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:54,311
and we get lost, then we are all
stuck in the woods.

613
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:57,114
I'm not risking it.
- Why didn't you say it before?

614
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:59,549
- I didn't think it was
a big deal until now.

615
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,452
We lock ourselves in,
and we'll be fine.

616
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,488
Nobody gets out tonight.

617
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,356
- Shit.

618
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:08,025
- Let's get inside.

619
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:10,560
- There it is.
I told you I got it.

620
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,629
- Joe? What the hell
is that?

621
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,332
I mean, look at the size of it
compared to the trees.

622
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:17,968
- I'm starting to think that
your boss isn't that crazy.

623
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,037
- A big foot?
- Yeah!

624
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,005
- Joe, are you talking
about a bigfoot?

625
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,007
- What else could it be? Huh?

626
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,376
It lives in a cave
in the middle of nowhere.

627
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:29,079
It's huge and
it's hungry for flesh.

628
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:32,349
What do you think
it could be then? Huh?

629
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:35,185
- I'm not sure what to think,
I'll be honest with you.

630
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:37,020
<i> Yeah, I'm pretty sure</i>
<i> it's his.</i>

631
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:38,322
<i> What's wrong with it?</i>

632
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,292
- All right,
that's enough for me.

633
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,054
- Are you coming, Matt?

634
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,123
- Yeah, I'll be there
in a minute.

635
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,534
- Hey. Are you okay?

636
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,770
- Yeah. I'm all right.

637
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,707
- Did you find out
what it was?

638
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,511
- No.

639
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,248
Joe thinks it might be
a bigfoot.

640
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,350
- A bigfoot?
- Yeah.

641
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,619
- Whoa. That's funny.

642
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,590
- I know, it's hard
to believe, right?

643
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,359
- It's hard to believe.

644
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:54,398
- I'm more concerned
about Teddy.

645
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,668
- I'm sure he's okay.

646
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:02,339
It's not his first time running
away. He'll be back.

647
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,675
- I don't think so.

648
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,279
He's gone.

649
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,427
Jess.
- Hmm?

650
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,730
- I'm tired.

651
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,435
I'm really tired...

652
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:34,071
Of losing people I love.

653
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:39,276
The baby, Teddy.

654
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,381
- Matt.
- I'm tired of this.

655
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:47,117
- Are you trying
to tell me something here?

656
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,524
- I don't think I can go
through this again.

657
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,226
I can't.

658
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,528
I know you wanna have a baby,
but I can't.

659
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,132
I don't think I can.

660
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,740
- Having a family is the most
important thing for me.

661
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,512
And a baby is a gift.

662
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,556
I'll understand
if you don't want to have one

663
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,859
but you better make
your mind up soon.

664
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:31,161
You might lose someone else
you love.

665
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,498
- Jess.

666
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Damnit.

667
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,284
- What was that?
- Jess? Jess?

668
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:56,553
- Oh, shit.
- What happened?

669
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,389
Holy shit!
Are you all right?

670
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:00,857
- What was that?
- Matt?

671
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,859
- Jess?
- Guys, what happened?

672
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,794
- We heard a scream.

673
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,563
- Everything's fine.

674
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:09,166
I think a bird just went
kamikaze into our window.

675
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:11,735
- A bird? Jeeze,
i thought it was the...

676
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:13,904
- No. No, it's not.

677
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,839
Jess, you're sure
you're all right?

678
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,908
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

679
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,644
Joe, come with me.

680
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:23,580
- Man, that bird
scare the shit out of me.

681
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,782
I thought
it was that bigfoot.

682
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:28,618
Or whatever it was, you know,
that followed us back here.

683
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,620
- Not the birthday you expected,
isn't it?

684
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,290
- Yo, no. Not at all.

685
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:35,659
- To your birthday, man.

686
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:38,895
- Matt, as your best friend
and as your doctor,

687
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:41,765
don't you think you've been
drinking a lot lately?

688
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,667
I mean, I...
I know you've had

689
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:45,502
a rough couple of months,
but you got--

690
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:47,704
- but what, Joe?
But what?

691
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,806
- You need to move on.

692
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,309
You're not the only person
that has lost a baby

693
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:54,277
and at least,
you can try again.

694
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,914
- And what?
Losing another one?

695
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,649
Take the chance
to lose another one?

696
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,618
- Come on, Matt.

697
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,221
- I'm not gonna have this
conservation with you. I'm not.

698
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:05,622
- Matt, don't be like this.

699
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:06,957
- I'm going to bed.

700
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,758
- That's right. Just go.
Walk away.

701
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,361
- Happy birthday, buddy.
- Hide.

702
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:14,264
- And by the way,
birds don't fly at night.

703
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,000
- I knew it.

704
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:20,337
I knew it. Goddamm it!

705
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
- Stupid phone.

706
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,610
Why won't you stop--

707
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,586
- what the hell's going on?

708
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:06,876
What the hell?

709
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,030
What the hell?

710
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:06,970
What...

711
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,821
What the hell
is going on here?

712
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,026
Shut up, shut up.

713
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,806
What the hell was that?

714
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,118
Hey!

715
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,055
Who's up?

716
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,668
Hey. Who's down there?

717
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,680
- Die.

718
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,817
Die.

719
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,786
Die. Die.

720
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,293
Die... die...

721
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:14,097
It's too late.
It's too late.

722
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,166
Die...

723
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:19,102
- Trey?

724
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:21,037
What are you doing?

725
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,039
Who are you talking to?

726
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,213
Die? Who's going to die?

727
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:33,616
You said it was too late.
Too late for what?

728
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:38,087
What's wrong with you, man?

729
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,897
What the hell is this?

730
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,148
We have to leave this place.

731
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,052
That's right.

732
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,371
Oh god.

733
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:04,173
Oh god.

734
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:54,757
Holy shit! You scared
the shit out of me, Julia!

735
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:56,259
- Who are you screaming at?

736
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:58,895
- This... creature
was in the cabin.

737
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:01,064
We're leaving now.
Grab your stuff.

738
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,965
- Have you seen Trey
anywhere?

739
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:04,867
- Yeah, he's in your room.

740
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,469
- No, he's not.
- What?

741
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:08,738
I put him to bed
a few minutes ago.

742
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,106
- Not in my bed.

743
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:12,041
- Julia, what are
you talking about?

744
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,010
- I woke up
and he wasn't there.

745
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:16,079
- See? Right there.

746
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:18,748
This is right after
i put him to bed.

747
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,984
What?

748
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:24,153
- I told you
he didn't go to bed.

749
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:25,988
Why is he walking
like that?

750
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,258
- Oh, shit.

751
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,127
Where is he going?

752
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,897
Whoa, whoa!

753
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,432
Can you see him?

754
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:38,401
- Hmm, there.

755
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,872
- No. No, no.
Don't go outside, Trey.

756
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:45,174
- Why is he going out?
Where is he?

757
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:47,143
Matt, where is he?

758
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:48,411
- Over there.

759
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,381
No.
- Trey, where are you going?

760
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:54,150
- The forest.

761
00:45:54,152 --> 00:45:57,253
- Trey...
- No. No.

762
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,291
- What the hell
is wrong with him?

763
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,367
- Do you have signal?

764
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:13,236
- No. I don't.

765
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,510
- Trey!

766
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,080
- What's going on?
- Shhh!

767
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:26,249
Your brother went
for a midnight stroll.

768
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:28,084
- What?
- That's what's going on.

769
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:29,852
- Trey!
- Why would he do that?

770
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:31,254
- You tell me!
- Oh, no.

771
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:33,456
I told him
not to go outside.

772
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,192
- Trey!
- Stop screaming!

773
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,929
- Trey! Answer me!

774
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:43,099
Trey, come on...

775
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,438
- Shhh, listen. Listen.

776
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,811
- We need
to get back inside. Now.

777
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,252
- Trey?
Trey, is that you?

778
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:04,520
- We shouldn't be out here.

779
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:06,189
- Trey...

780
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:08,558
Ah, screw this!
I'm going to get him!

781
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,393
- Hey, hey, no!
- What?

782
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:12,428
- I told you
it was too dangerous.

783
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,497
- Matt,
we gotta do something.

784
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:17,266
- You and
your stupid monster!

785
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:20,069
- All right, that's it!
I'm gonna go wake up Joe.

786
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:22,605
Jess, make sure
she doesn't go in there.

787
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:23,840
- Okay.

788
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:26,209
- What's going on?

789
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:27,610
<i> Trey!</i>

790
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,015
- Julia!
- Jess! Where's Julia?

791
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:36,052
- She just went in there.
- I told you to keep her here.

792
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:39,088
- Yeah, I know. She went in,
what do you want me to do?

793
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,923
- Shit!
- What's going on?

794
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:42,425
- Julia's in the forest.

795
00:47:42,427 --> 00:47:44,193
- What?
You're kidding me right?

796
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,862
- I wish.
- Ah, shit.

797
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:47,430
I knew we should have left
last night.

798
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:49,432
- You guys,
get back in the cabin

799
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:51,601
and try to call for help.
Let's go, Joe.

800
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:53,369
- What the hell
is going on here?

801
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,271
- Trey?

802
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:58,040
- I gotta be the dumbest idiot
to follow you.

803
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,877
If I die here, you better tell
my mom it was your fault.

804
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:03,546
- Hey! I'm not losing
anyone else.

805
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,616
- I'm sorry, Matt.

806
00:48:06,618 --> 00:48:08,251
I'm sorry.

807
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,254
- Julia?

808
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,024
Trey?

809
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:17,126
Julia?

810
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:19,428
- I can't believe
we're back in these woods

811
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,963
'cause of that little brat.

812
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:22,398
- Trey?

813
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,166
- I just don't
understand why he had

814
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,102
to come back.
It doesn't make sense.

815
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:28,571
- Look, I don't think Trey
knew what he was doing.

816
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,539
- What? Tell me
what's going on here then!

817
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:33,109
- Trey walked in the forest
like a frickin' zombie.

818
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:35,378
Like some kind of force
was dragging him in.

819
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,613
He looked like
he was hypnotized.

820
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:40,016
- What do you mean,
"hypnotized"?

821
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:43,519
- When I went downstairs,
he kept repeating 'die, die'.

822
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:45,421
Something was going to die.
Or someone.

823
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,156
- Die?
- I don't know if--

824
00:48:47,158 --> 00:48:49,125
- who's gonna die?
- I don't know!

825
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:52,028
But there's one thing I know.
This thing, this creature,

826
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,430
whatever it is, was in the cabin
after Trey disappeared.

827
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,399
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

828
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:58,134
I didn't want
to scare the girls.

829
00:48:58,136 --> 00:49:00,536
- That's great of you.
That's real sweet of you

830
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:02,538
'cause you scare
the shit out of me now!

831
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,632
- Hey!

832
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:32,001
- Matt! Don't!

833
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:36,639
- What do you want from us?

834
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,012
- Look.
- What could they want?

835
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,025
- They're leaving.

836
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

837
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,380
- Oh, shit, Matt!

838
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:25,254
Oh! Oh!
Oh my god! Oh my god!

839
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:28,024
Go, go, go!

840
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,494
Oh! Oh! Oh my god!

841
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:35,531
- Turn off the light. Turn off
the light! Turn it off!

842
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:39,668
No, I don't think so.

843
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,437
- Let's get back now.
Let's go!

844
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:43,606
- No! Not without Trey
and Julia!

845
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,244
- I...
I can't place a call,

846
00:50:48,246 --> 00:50:49,745
my phone
is still recording.

847
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:52,281
- Try mine.
It might work.

848
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,554
- <i> 911,</i>
<i> what's your emergency?</i>

849
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,222
- Yes, 911!

850
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,458
Yeah, hi!
My name is Jessica Donovan,

851
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,361
we're staying at a cottage
in gracefield, Quebec.

852
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:09,331
And the address is 11...
1111 ranger lake.

853
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,634
Can you hear me?

854
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:13,669
Hello? Can you hear?
My brother and his girlfriend

855
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:16,072
disappeared in the forest
after deciding--

856
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:17,673
- <i> I triangulate your location.</i>
- Hello?

857
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:19,775
Shit! Hello, can you hear?

858
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:22,378
If you can hear me,
can you just please send help?

859
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,679
- <i> Madam?</i>

860
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,716
- The call dropped.
The call dropped!

861
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,652
There's no...
There's no signal.

862
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:31,420
- Oh my god!

863
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,289
Look what I've found.

864
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,393
- Bigfoot sightings?

865
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:39,528
What the hell is this?

866
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,799
- That's the cabin.

867
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:46,235
- And...
The cave they went to.

868
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:49,705
Cornfield.
- Farmer blackburn's property.

869
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:51,807
- This is insane!

870
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:54,410
Okay. Matt's boss is a lot
crazier then I thought.

871
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,149
- That's not gonna work.

872
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:02,351
- Yes, it is gonna work.

873
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:04,553
The balloons are gonna
track us back to the cabin.

874
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:06,388
- This is so ridiculous!

875
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:08,224
- Hey, do you have
a better plan?

876
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:10,392
'Cause I'm not getting
lost in these woods again.

877
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:14,797
Let's go. Let's find Trey
and Julia and get out of here.

878
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,470
- Trey?

879
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,206
Where are you?

880
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,476
Trey!

881
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:30,646
Look,
you don't need to try

882
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,548
and impress me anymore, okay?

883
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,186
I can't even see
the cabin from here!

884
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,696
There you are.

885
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,900
Why did you come back here?

886
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:58,807
Trey! Can you please answer me?

887
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Trey?
Where the hell did you go?

888
00:53:34,946 --> 00:53:37,846
- Julia! Julia!

889
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,250
Julia!

890
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:43,886
- Julia!
Where is she?

891
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:46,989
- Julia!
- Julia!

892
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,826
- You see anything?
- No!

893
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:52,661
- Julia!

894
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,601
- Where the hell is she?

895
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:00,369
- She can't be that far.

896
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:02,638
- I think our minds'
are playing tricks on us.

897
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,473
Let's get out of here.
- No!

898
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:07,009
No, no. We can't.
- Come on.

899
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:09,245
Julia!

900
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:15,718
Joe. Joe...

901
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,720
- Is that Julia's?

902
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:19,521
- Yeah.

903
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,626
- Julia!

904
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:26,729
- Oh... my... god...

905
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:28,397
- What?

906
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:30,366
- Oh, Matt!

907
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,469
- Holy shit.

908
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,804
What the hell did
they do to her?

909
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:38,440
- How did her clothes
get up there?

910
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,279
Matt, what's going on?
What happened to her?

911
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:44,647
- I don't know.

912
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:47,816
- What the hell was that?

913
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:50,386
- Trey! Trey!

914
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,489
- No, no, Matt!

915
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,866
- Trey! Where are you?

916
00:55:03,868 --> 00:55:05,567
- Matt!

917
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,373
Matt! Where are you?

918
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,411
Matt! Where are you?

919
00:55:17,415 --> 00:55:18,914
- Trey!

920
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,855
- What the hell
happened here?

921
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,759
- He's not here.
Where the hell is he?

922
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:33,429
- Matt. Let's get
out of here! Now!

923
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:35,464
- No! I'm not leaving
anybody behind.

924
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:37,066
- I don't like
this place, man.

925
00:55:37,068 --> 00:55:39,568
I don't think we're gonna
find Trey or Julia here.

926
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,937
- Guys!
- Stop, Matt.

927
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:44,573
Stop.
- Hey! We can't leave them here.

928
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:46,809
- No, Matt. But look around you.
Look around here.

929
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:49,345
The corn is twelve feet tall.

930
00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:52,648
Everywhere you look,
it's the same damn thing!

931
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,750
The only way you're gonna find
someone here,

932
00:55:54,752 --> 00:55:56,352
is with a helicopter.

933
00:55:56,354 --> 00:55:58,020
- What did you say?

934
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:00,656
- I said that the only way

935
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:02,691
you're gonna find someone here
is through the air

936
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,126
unless you learned how to fly--

937
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:06,795
- that's it. That's it.
- What "it"?

938
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:08,797
- Gimme your phone.
Gimme your phone.

939
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,066
- Matt, it has no reception.
- It doesn't matter.

940
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:13,369
You just said it,
if we can tie this

941
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:15,671
to the balloons, right,
and we can get it airborne.

942
00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:18,006
- And then you'll have a whole
perspective on this place.

943
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:19,742
- Exactly!
- Yes!

944
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:21,910
- How many balloons
do we have left? Come on.

945
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:24,146
- We only have two.
- Oh shit!

946
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:27,850
- What?

947
00:56:27,852 --> 00:56:29,151
- Joe.

948
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:30,853
- What? What is it?

949
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:33,789
- Our balloons.

950
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,491
- What the...

951
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:39,628
- Those are the balloons
we used in the forest.

952
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,166
- Are they doing this to us?

953
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:45,868
- Who else can it be?

954
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:47,836
- Why?
- Grab them.

955
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:49,972
- Yeah, but, how are--
- it doesn't matter.

956
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:52,641
- How are we gonna get back?
- Just pick them up!

957
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:54,109
Is it recording?

958
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:56,478
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

959
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:02,785
All right, let it go.
- All right.

960
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:04,186
You really think
this is gonna work?

961
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:07,689
- Yes. I do.
Don't drop it.

962
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:09,458
- I'm not gonna drop it.

963
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,026
- Come on. Higher.

964
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,530
- It's working. It's working!

965
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:55,137
- Holy shit!
- What is that?

966
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:57,506
- This... this symbol.

967
00:57:57,508 --> 00:57:59,107
- What is it? What?

968
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:01,610
- I saw this symbol
last night on TV.

969
00:58:01,612 --> 00:58:03,111
Just before Trey disappeared.

970
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:04,780
- You saw this before?
- Yeah.

971
00:58:04,782 --> 00:58:06,515
- And you're telling
me this now?

972
00:58:06,517 --> 00:58:08,050
- Yeah.
- What does it mean?

973
00:58:08,052 --> 00:58:10,519
- How should I know
what it means, Joe?

974
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:12,654
What the hell are we
dealing with here?

975
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,590
- Maybe they're trying
to communicate with us.

976
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:16,258
- They? Who's they?

977
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,627
And what the hell
do they want from us?

978
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:20,128
- Trey?
- What?

979
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,730
- Trey!
- Where?

980
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:22,931
- There.

981
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:27,202
- Trey! Trey!

982
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,771
- Matt!
- Where are you?

983
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:32,574
- Shit. Matt, hold on!

984
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:34,743
- Hurry!
- Wait for me!

985
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:36,745
Shit! Shit!

986
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:37,913
- Where are you, kid?

987
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:38,914
- Wait!

988
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:44,653
Matt, wait up!

989
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:46,655
- Oh no! Oh no!

990
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:48,590
Trey!

991
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,093
- Matt!

992
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:53,996
- Oh god.

993
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:55,764
Oh god.

994
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:00,636
- Oh shit.

995
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:02,004
Oh shit.

996
00:59:02,006 --> 00:59:04,206
- Trey is gone, man.

997
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:08,043
Can you believe...

998
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,845
- Matt, Matt. Shhh! Shhh!

999
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:20,188
- Go, go, go!

1000
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:24,092
Ah! Ah!

1001
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,336
- Matt! Matt!

1002
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,174
Oh shit!

1003
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:20,015
Oh no! Oh no!

1004
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:38,834
- Stop, stop, stop.

1005
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,807
Those things
are looking for us.

1006
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,843
- Holy shit.

1007
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:49,678
You think we lost them?

1008
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,014
- No, I don't think so, Joe.
We can't stay here.

1009
01:00:52,016 --> 01:00:53,982
We have to go.
- What's going on?

1010
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,851
What just happened?
Where's Trey? Where's Julia?

1011
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:58,854
- I don't know, Joe!
I don't have the answer to that!

1012
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:00,789
But I have
a really weird feeling

1013
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:02,190
that they used
Trey as a messenger.

1014
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:04,192
- A messenger?
- Yes!

1015
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:06,862
When I went downstairs last
night, he wasn't feeling well.

1016
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:08,296
Why? Because they did
something to him.

1017
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:10,065
They gave him a message.
- A message?

1018
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:11,800
- Yes! About this...

1019
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:13,735
This someone, something,
that was going to die.

1020
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:16,138
All this nonsense that he kept
repeating in the basement.

1021
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,240
- Why would they use Trey?
- Why?

1022
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:20,342
Because these things are
trying to communicate with us!

1023
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:23,111
You were right about this. They
were listening to us out there.

1024
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:25,280
There's a reason why they gave
us back our balloons

1025
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:26,982
when we needed them.

1026
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:30,118
They wanted us to
see that symbol.

1027
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,722
- Yeah but what does
it mean, huh?

1028
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:37,859
- I don't know
what it means.

1029
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,795
But it's not important
for now.

1030
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:42,931
- Yes, it is!
Come on, Matt. Think about it.

1031
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:44,966
These things are getting more
and more aggressive

1032
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:46,935
and impatient with us.
We gotta figure it out.

1033
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:49,971
- We will but right now, we just
have to get to the cabin,

1034
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:51,940
get the girls
and get some help.

1035
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:54,242
- And how are we supposed
to do that, huh? Huh?

1036
01:01:54,244 --> 01:01:57,079
We have no guide, we have no way
to get back. We're lost.

1037
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:59,414
- Shit.

1038
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,249
We can't stay here.

1039
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:03,151
- Oh shit! Shit! Shit!

1040
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:04,186
- What? What?

1041
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:06,321
- The balloons.

1042
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:08,423
They weren't there
a second ago.

1043
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:10,892
- Maybe they'll lead us back
to the cabin.

1044
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,828
- No. No!
- Look, Joe.

1045
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,463
There's no other option.
I say we go.

1046
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:16,098
- Huh, huh.
- Right?

1047
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,833
Let's go before these
things come back.

1048
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:19,468
- No, no, no,
think about it.

1049
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:21,470
- There's no other option.
I'm not staying here.

1050
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:23,105
- They're probably
around us right now.

1051
01:02:23,107 --> 01:02:24,506
- I'm not staying here.
I'm going.

1052
01:02:24,508 --> 01:02:26,141
- Wait, no, no, no!
Wait, wait!

1053
01:02:26,143 --> 01:02:27,876
They are probably
watching us right now!

1054
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:29,778
- Oh shit!
- What's going on?

1055
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,747
- I dropped my eye.
- Matt, forget it!

1056
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:33,782
We can't lose time with this.
Let's go!

1057
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:36,418
- It must be here, I need it.
It recorded the whole thing.

1058
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,521
- What? I knew it! That's what
the red light was all about.

1059
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:42,457
There it is.
Good. All right.

1060
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:44,226
Okay, let's go!

1061
01:02:44,228 --> 01:02:46,027
- We made it.

1062
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:49,998
- Come on!

1063
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,833
Liz!
- Joe?

1064
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:53,869
In here.
- Thank god.

1065
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:55,470
- Where we you guys?
- Where's Trey?

1066
01:02:55,472 --> 01:02:57,239
- And Julia?
- We couldn't find them.

1067
01:02:57,241 --> 01:02:59,207
- What do you mean
you couldn't find them?

1068
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:01,009
- They have to be somewhere.

1069
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:02,878
- We looked everywhere,
we couldn't find them.

1070
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,880
Drop it.
- Oh my god. Oh my god.

1071
01:03:04,882 --> 01:03:07,215
- I'm sorry, baby.
Jess, calm down.

1072
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:09,918
We did everything we could...
- Tell me this is not happening.

1073
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,121
- We have to get out of here.
We have to go get some help.

1074
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:15,257
- I'm not leaving my brother
here. Are you crazy?

1075
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:17,826
- Listen, we can't stay here!
Do you understand me?

1076
01:03:17,828 --> 01:03:19,795
- I'm not leaving him.
They might come back.

1077
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:21,997
- Matt, you can't stay here.

1078
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:23,965
- I know but Jess
won't leave her brother.

1079
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,934
- Take the camera,
you might need the light.

1080
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:28,370
- Okay, thanks.
I think the gas station

1081
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:31,039
is about 25 miles from here
but I'm not sure where exactly.

1082
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:33,508
- We'll be back soon.
It shouldn't take us too long.

1083
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,277
- Yeah, the sooner, the better.
- Yeah.

1084
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:37,045
- Be careful!

1085
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:39,181
- I'm sure Trey and Julia
are gonna be fine.

1086
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:43,518
- That's not reassuring.
- No.

1087
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,921
- It doesn't want to start.

1088
01:03:45,923 --> 01:03:48,156
- You gotta be kidding me.
- No.

1089
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,594
Oh shit!
- What's wrong with it?

1090
01:03:52,596 --> 01:03:54,563
- The fuse box fried.

1091
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:57,299
- Shit!
- It's probably another surge.

1092
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:59,935
- But we haven't used this
since we got here.

1093
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:01,536
- It's probably
the same frequency

1094
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,338
that fried the fuse box
inside the house.

1095
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,841
- So it was caused
by the power surge we got?

1096
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:08,210
- Maybe. Maybe not.
- Can you fix it, baby?

1097
01:04:08,212 --> 01:04:10,045
- Yeah,
with my eyes closed.

1098
01:04:10,047 --> 01:04:12,080
If I had an other fuse
but I don't.

1099
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:14,482
We truck here, we're not going
anywhere the way it is.

1100
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:17,185
- Shit.
- What do we do now?

1101
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,925
- I got an idea.

1102
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:27,596
- You wanna use the bikes?
Come on, Joe!

1103
01:04:27,598 --> 01:04:29,397
- What time is it?

1104
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:32,167
- Shit! My watch
is still messed up.

1105
01:04:32,169 --> 01:04:35,003
- Look, we got about
five hours before sunset.

1106
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:37,472
Liz and I can make it to
the gas station within three--

1107
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:39,608
- Joe, I don't think
this is a good--

1108
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:41,276
- Matt! We have no choice.

1109
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:43,511
- Liz! I think
you should stay with us.

1110
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:46,214
- Hey, I'm not gonna
let him go by himself

1111
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,016
with these things around.

1112
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:50,185
Plus he needs me
to cover his ass.

1113
01:04:50,187 --> 01:04:52,988
- Guys, we'll be back in a
couple hours with some help.

1114
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,990
- Joe, you stay on the road,

1115
01:04:54,992 --> 01:04:56,958
no matter what you stay
on the road, okay?

1116
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,261
- Don't worry, man.
We'll be back in a couple hours.

1117
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:01,062
Come on, Liz. Let's go!

1118
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:06,001
- Joe?

1119
01:05:06,003 --> 01:05:07,469
Joe?

1120
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:20,682
- Whoa. Oh, there.

1121
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,419
Press stop.
- Whoa.

1122
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,121
- Oh my god!

1123
01:05:26,123 --> 01:05:28,256
- I knew I heard something.
- Oh my god!

1124
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:30,659
What happened to Liz and Joe?
- I'm not sure.

1125
01:05:30,661 --> 01:05:32,961
- And what happened
to my brother and Julia?

1126
01:05:32,963 --> 01:05:36,031
- I don't know. I mean, look,
Jess, we... we found them

1127
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:37,432
in this cornfield.
- What?

1128
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:40,068
- After we discovered
that symbol.

1129
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:42,470
- No, no, no. No, no!
What happened to him?

1130
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:45,140
What was this symbol? What does
it have to do with anything?

1131
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:47,108
- I don't know.
- Matt! What's going on!

1132
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,610
- I don't know! Okay?

1133
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:51,112
So can you calm down
and help me find some clues.

1134
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:53,014
I would really
appreciate it.

1135
01:05:53,016 --> 01:05:54,683
- <i> Matt! Watch out!</i>

1136
01:05:54,685 --> 01:05:57,485
- Shit!
I thought I deleted this.

1137
01:05:57,487 --> 01:06:00,021
<i> Ah, oh my god.</i>

1138
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:03,358
I'm sorry.

1139
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,160
- I'm sorry.

1140
01:06:05,162 --> 01:06:07,729
- I'll see if I can find
anything on Joe's camera.

1141
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,969
<i> - Early this morning</i>
<i> an American satellite</i>

1142
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:16,271
<i> was destroyed by what</i>
<i> authorities are calling</i>

1143
01:06:16,273 --> 01:06:18,573
<i> an unidentified object.</i>
- Hold on!

1144
01:06:18,575 --> 01:06:20,608
<i> - Images taken by</i>
<i> the satellite itself...</i>

1145
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,978
- This?
- Yeah. Play it again.

1146
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,613
<i> - ... authorities are calling</i>
<i> an unidentified object.</i>

1147
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:28,483
<i> Images taken by the satellite</i>
<i> itself moments before </i>

1148
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:31,419
<i> it was destroyed seems</i>
<i> to indicate that a collision</i>

1149
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:34,522
<i> between the satellite</i>
<i> and the object was the cause.</i>

1150
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:37,726
- Stop!

1151
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,998
Holy shit.
- Oh my god!

1152
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,468
Ah! Oh my god!
It tried to grab you!

1153
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:48,470
- Shit.

1154
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:53,208
It wasn't trying to grab me.

1155
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:57,178
- Matt!
Matt, open the door!

1156
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:01,583
Matt, please.
What are you doing in there?

1157
01:07:01,585 --> 01:07:04,219
Why did you lock yourself in?

1158
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:09,424
I'm really worried
so open the door.

1159
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:17,098
Matt? Tell me
what's going on.

1160
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,671
Tell me what's going on.

1161
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:25,540
- The symbol.

1162
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,243
- Matt, you're really,
really scaring me right now.

1163
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:30,245
Open the door! Open up!

1164
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:32,213
Matt! Open the door!

1165
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,715
What are you doing in there?

1166
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:35,517
- We're leaving
this place in 30 seconds!

1167
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:38,186
- What? Can you tell
me what's going on?

1168
01:07:38,188 --> 01:07:41,423
- It has been looking
for this rock the whole time.

1169
01:07:41,425 --> 01:07:43,558
- Holy shit!
What do you think it is?

1170
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,226
- Maybe some kind of

1171
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,195
radio transmitting device
or something.

1172
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:48,763
Yeah.

1173
01:07:48,765 --> 01:07:51,332
Look, there's only one way
out of this.

1174
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:53,334
We're gonna give them
this rock

1175
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:55,637
but only if they give us back
our friends.

1176
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:58,807
Otherwise, we're not giving
them anything.

1177
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,116
Wait! Wait!
- What?

1178
01:08:08,118 --> 01:08:11,086
- No. Not that way.
We'll take the basement.

1179
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:13,254
- No.
- They might be right outside.

1180
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:14,789
I think it's safer.

1181
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:17,325
- Okay, let's go.

1182
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,202
Oh I don't wanna go.

1183
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:29,170
- Let me go first. Here.

1184
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:32,173
Grab the camera.
Let's go, follow me.

1185
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:37,112
We saw these creatures today,
in a cornfield.

1186
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:45,220
We have to find a way to make it
there without them seeing us.

1187
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,591
I think that's why they have
your brother and Julia.

1188
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,365
Turn off the light.
Turn off the light.

1189
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:02,470
- What's your plan?

1190
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,772
- The cornfield is about
a quarter mile from here.

1191
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:06,608
There's a farm
on the edge it.

1192
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:09,644
We have to find a way to make it
there and call for help.

1193
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,746
- Come on, are you sure? Okay.
- Yes.

1194
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:17,385
- What?
What are you doing?

1195
01:09:17,387 --> 01:09:19,687
- Oh my god.

1196
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- We have to go.
Matt, what the hell
are you doing?
What's the matter, Matt?

1197

Go, go, go!

Let's get out of here.
Go upstairs!

Oh shit!

Are you all right? Hey!

1214
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:41,402

Let's go! Let's go!

What? What?

Holy shit.

1220
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:19,774
- What happened? Matt,
what happened to Liz and Joe?

1221
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:22,577
- We need to get into
that forest. Let's go, now!

We can't stay.

1227
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,095
I can't.

1228
01:12:14,097 --> 01:12:16,531
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

1229
01:12:18,068 --> 01:12:20,001
Matt!

1230
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,973
Let him go.

Go! Go, go, go!

Get up! Get up!

Let's go! Matt!
Give them the rock.

1242
01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:05,913
- No. They have to give us
our friends first.

1243
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:12,787

01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:03,571
Where is my wife?
Where is my wife?

1254
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:07,208
I'm not giving you this rock
until you give me my wife.
