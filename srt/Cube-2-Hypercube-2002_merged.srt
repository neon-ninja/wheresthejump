1
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,230
Hello?

2
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,350
Anyone here?

3
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,630
Hello.

4
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

5
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,030
Numbers...

6
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,830
where's the goddamn numbers?

7
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,750
There's something...

8
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,550
Oh shit.

9
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,390
I mean, they're my numbers...

10
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,030
Damn! Don't I at least
get a shot with my numbers,

11
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,630
you stupid fucks?!

12
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,070
I want a chance!

13
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,350
I want a chance
like everyone else.

14
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,230
Oh my God.

15
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,590
Oh, you bastards.

16
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,630
Our Father Which art in heaven,

17
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,110
hallowed be Thy name.

18
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,190
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

19
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,070
on earth as it is
in heaven.

20
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,310
Give us this day
our daily bread,

21
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,790
and forgive us our debts
as we forgive our debtors.

22
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,350
Lead us not into temptation...

23
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,430
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

24
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,870
For Thine...

25
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,870
is the kingdom...

26
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,990
and the power...

27
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,710
and the glory,
forever and ever.

28
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,910
Amen.

29
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,590
Hello?

30
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,070
Are you all right?

31
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,230
Can you hear me?

32
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,630
Are you hurt?

33
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,510
Don't move.
Don't make a sound.

34
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,670
I said, "Don't move."

35
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,430
Are you alone?

36
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,990
Blink once for yes,

37
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,990
twice for no.

38
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,310
Is there anyone else
in the other room?

39
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,350
All right.

40
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,750
All right. I'm going
to release you.

41
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,630
But I can take you down again,
as quick as the first time.

42
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,310
So don't scream, understand?

43
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,990
Once for yes,
twice for no.

44
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,470
Are you alone?

45
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,750
All right.

46
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,750
All right.

47
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,710
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

48
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,190
How many rooms
have you been in?

49
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,510
What is this place?

50
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,430
I don't know. You tell me,
how many rooms you've been in?

51
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,310
I don't know, five or six.
What about you?

52
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,390
Uh...
this is my third.

53
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,950
You sure you didn't see
anyone else?

54
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,910
No.

55
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,110
Have you?

56
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,470
No.

57
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,110
So who are you?

58
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,870
Who are you?

59
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,270
What the fuck are those noises?

60
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,030
Relax. This is just for show.
Pretend that you're scared.

61
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,350
Should be easy.

62
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,350
All right. Get down here now,
or she's dead.

63
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,550
Some hero.

64
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,110
I have that effect
on men.

65
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,190
Glad to see you haven't
lost your sense of humor.

66
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,110
- Is this really necessary?
- Just hang on.

67
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,270
Woman:
Isn't that the same...

68
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,230
Yes.

69
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,310
Hey!

70
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,270
Come back!

71
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,310
Wait.

72
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,750
Jesus Christ.

73
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,590
Hey! Wait!

74
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,350
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?

75
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,510
This guy sure moves quickly.
He's just gone.

76
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,750
Maybe something made him go,
maybe you should come back.

77
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,750
This place is awful.

78
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,830
Please don't hurt me.

79
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,830
Don't be frightened.

80
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,030
Don't worry.

81
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,350
There's nobody else here.
Just me.

82
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,590
I'm Kate.

83
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,710
What's your name?

84
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,670
Sasha.

85
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,230
That's a beautiful name.

86
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,150
Don't worry.

87
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,350
Everything's going to be
all right, okay?

88
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,310
Do you understand me?

89
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,710
I'm just blind,

90
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,590
not retarded.

91
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,750
Finally.

92
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,990
I was beginning to wonder
if I was the only one in here.

93
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,470
I kept hoping I would
find some other people.

94
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,750
I've been wondering around
these rooms for hours.

95
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,390
Stay away from me!

96
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,390
No one's going to hurt you.

97
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,390
Well, certainly not.

98
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,550
No. No.
I come in peace, young lady.

99
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,910
I'm Jerry.

100
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,190
This is Sasha.
She's blind.

101
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,670
And she's very scared.

102
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,790
What a bummer,

103
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,470
to be blind
in this place.

104
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,590
Do you know what
this place is?

105
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,310
No. No. No.

106
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,030
I don't suppose,
either of you two could

107
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,390
let me know what
we're doing in here?

108
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,430
No.

109
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,910
Oh... Jerry Whitehall.

110
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,870
Kate Filmore.

111
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,950
What are you doing?

112
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,550
I'm marking the rooms.

113
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,630
This is the fourth room
you've been in?

114
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,590
Yeah.

115
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,950
I thought you said you've been
wandering these rooms for hours.

116
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,390
Yeah. That's the weird thing
isn't it?

117
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,230
Each one of these rooms,
has six of these doors,

118
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,190
or portals.

119
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,910
But no matter how many portals
I go through,

120
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,830
I always wound up
in the same three rooms.

121
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,470
Until now.

122
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,270
It's as if the rooms
were moving around or something.

123
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,230
Yeah. But I don't feel
any motion, do you?

124
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,190
No.

125
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,750
It's just so strange.

126
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,710
I ran into this guy...

127
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,790
Oh no.
It's getting closer!

128
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,070
- What is?
- I don't know.

129
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,470
Something's coming after us,
and I don't think it likes us.

130
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,630
I don't hear any people.
I think it's just motors.

131
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,630
He wants us dead. We have
to get out of here right now.

132
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,790
Any suggestion
on which way to go next?

133
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,590
Your guess is as good as mine.
I don't know.

134
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,550
Please, we have to move!

135
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,750
Uh... here.

136
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,030
Okay. Sasha, we're going to have
to climb a bit of a ladder.

137
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,230
Hold on to me.

138
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,470
- Move quickly.
- Get me out of here!

139
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,070
Help!

140
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,310
- Help me!
- Oh God!

141
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,710
There's a guy hanging.

142
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,590
I can't hold him
much longer!

143
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,790
- Okay. I'm coming.
- Oh my God.

144
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,230
What's happening?

145
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,750
Hurry!

146
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,590
Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on.

147
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,830
Grab his...

148
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,950
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

149
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,590
Here...

150
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,110
Good girl. Good girl.

151
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,150
Sasha,
you're going to be okay.

152
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,550
Just stay here.
You're going to be okay.

153
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,630
There you are.
You've found some friends, huh?

154
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,590
Help me get him down.

155
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,550
Fantastic.

156
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,150
- Give me some space.
- I'm here.

157
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,510
- I can grab his legs.
- I'm loosening the belt.

158
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,910
All right.
All right. I got him.

159
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,590
I'm losing it.

160
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,390
Ready, you got it?

161
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,870
- Yeah.
- Hurry.

162
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,070
There it goes.

163
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,630
I know you want a cigarette,
but not yet.

164
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,030
- Slowly. Easy.
- I've got his legs.

165
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,830
Lean him up
against this wall.

166
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,630
Okay. Watch his head.

167
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,950
That's it.

168
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,750
Just make sure he's upright.

169
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,630
He's alive.

170
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,110
He's breathing.

171
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,470
Good.

172
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,430
He's military.

173
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,670
Colonel Thomas H. Maguire,
Department of Defense,

174
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,510
Jesus Christ.

175
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,910
He's Pentagon,
hi-tech liaison.

176
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,190
You...

177
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,670
how the hell would you know?

178
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,790
A buddy of mine's
doing 10- 20 upstate

179
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,270
for cracking the mainframe
on the Pentagon two years ago.

180
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,110
I helped him write the code.
Maybe that's why I'm in here.

181
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,230
You know for sure
we're in prison?

182
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,950
- I'm assuming...
- You know what they say.

183
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,990
Thanks.
That's helpful.

184
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,110
Jerry Whitehall. Thanks.

185
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,670
Simon Grady.

186
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,190
That's Kate.

187
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,230
Sasha.

188
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,310
I'm sorry. I didn't get
your name.

189
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,150
Max Reisler.

190
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,590
- Thanks.
- Sasha...

191
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,310
Sasha...

192
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,270
Jerry, could you...

193
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,230
Jerry:
Sure, of course.

194
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,550
Simon:
Come on, sit him up.

195
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,310
Let's get you sitting
up straight here.

196
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,190
Sasha, you okay?

197
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,310
This man's been beaten badly.

198
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,430
He's been tortured.

199
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,270
Look at his hand.

200
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,350
- Cigarette burns.
- Jesus.

201
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,790
Sasha:
They're coming for us next.

202
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,390
Don't you worry.
I won't let anyone hurt you.

203
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,390
I hope it's that easy, Kate.

204
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,590
There's nothing in here.

205
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,510
What do you think?

206
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,110
I figure he knows something
he didn't want anyone to know.

207
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,710
That's usually why people
are tortured.

208
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,070
How do you know,
Mr. Cigarette Burns?

209
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,670
What are you, an expert?

210
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,190
As a matter of fact,
you weedy little shit...

211
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,510
They're coming!
They're coming!

212
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,230
They're coming.
They're coming.

213
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,150
Oh, hello.

214
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,310
Do you know where
the showers are?

215
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,550
I seem to be lost, again.

216
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,030
I always get lost
in this gym.

217
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,070
I don't know why my daughter-in-law
insists on bringing me here.

218
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,270
It's all the way across town.

219
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,270
Whoa.

220
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,630
Watch your step.
Watch your step.

221
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,150
Thank you, dear.

222
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,030
Oh my goodness.

223
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,390
I'm afraid I can't help you
with the showers.

224
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,790
I'm Jerry.

225
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,910
You're not little Jerry Reisback,
are you?

226
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,310
No.

227
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,870
Thank goodness. He's my paperboy,
and I owe him $10.

228
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,510
Right. Well, this is Simon.

229
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,870
Kate and Sasha.

230
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,830
Hello.

231
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,590
And uh...

232
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,990
Max.

233
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,310
Max.

234
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,670
- Max.
- And you are?

235
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,150
I'm Mrs. Paley.

236
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,550
How do you do Mrs. Paley?

237
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,630
You don't happen to know
why you're here, do you?

238
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,630
Oh dear. I was never
very good at philosophy.

239
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,590
Do any of us know
what's going on here?

240
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,750
Sorry.

241
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,950
I've been trying to get a handle
on the configuration of these rooms.

242
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,990
All I can say is...

243
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,550
They just don't make
any sense.

244
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,510
That's right.
They sure don't.

245
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,550
It's as if the rooms
are moving around very quickly.

246
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,510
There's got to be
some kind of logic to it.

247
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,910
These rooms
just seem to repeat.

248
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,230
You go in one direction,
the room just loops back on itself.

249
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,190
It's getting closer.

250
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,030
Sasha, do you know
what it is?

251
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,910
Not really.

252
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,710
But I can hear it.

253
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,110
All the time,
even when you don't.

254
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,230
And it sounds...

255
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,070
...it feels wrong.

256
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,910
Mrs. Paley:
Maybe we're in hell.

257
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,590
All right,

258
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,910
let's get
some real answers.

259
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,310
His answer was suicide.

260
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,710
Not exactly
a comforting thought.

261
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,990
Soldier, up on your feet.

262
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,750
Careful, he's hurt.

263
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,390
Come on, pumpkin,
up you come.

264
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,270
Stop it.
He's in serious condition.

265
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,310
Stop it.

266
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,310
Listen to me, sweetheart...

267
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,750
I'm not your sweetheart,
asshole.

268
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,470
All right.
This man's been tortured.

269
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,790
You want to be next
when they come for us?

270
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,830
Who exactly are they?

271
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,350
Well, I'm going to find out.
Come on.

272
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,870
Stop it. Stop it.

273
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,590
Are you trying to kill us?

274
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,230
It's not going to help us
if he dies, you know?

275
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,710
You've got
no information whatsoever.

276
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,630
- It's here.
- Jesus...

277
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,990
what the fuck?!

278
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,910
Come on.

279
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,030
He's conscious.

280
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,990
Sit him up.
Sit him up.

281
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,110
Come on, soldier.
Talk to me, soldier.

282
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,950
Talk to me.
What's going on here?

283
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,550
Colonel:
Are you speaking to me?

284
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,910
Yes. Jesus Christ. Yes.

285
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,590
Just tell me, how do we get
out of here?

286
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,190
I don't know.

287
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,790
You figure out the code,

288
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,590
you get out.

289
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,670
The first one had rules...

290
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,270
The first one?
What are you talking about?

291
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,830
Leave him alone.
He's delirious.

292
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,990
He knows something,
all right?

293
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,310
I'll carry him myself,
just...

294
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,470
Colonel:
The first one had numbers...

295
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,350
What do you mean,
"the first one"?

296
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,590
- Let him go.
- I'm out of here.

297
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,630
Oh my God.
Are you okay?

298
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,870
Did you hit your head?

299
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,150
Yeah. I slipped.

300
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,430
It's a wall.
It wiggled.

301
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,870
- You sure you're okay...
- Look. There it goes again.

302
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,630
Jerry:
That... that... that...

303
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,990
That's... that's...
I don't know.

304
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,950
No!

305
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,390
Holy fuck.

306
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,350
What is that?

307
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,870
I don't know.

308
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,630
But I don't think we should
stick around to find out.

309
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,550
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

310
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,470
Kate:
Come on, Sasha, I'm here.

311
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,430
I'm right behind you, honey.

312
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,510
Hurry, let's go!

313
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,790
Easy, easy...

314
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,990
For Christ's sake.

315
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,190
What the...

316
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,630
Come on.
There you go.

317
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,790
- Grab right there.
- Where are you?

318
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,070
Come on, Colonel.

319
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,950
It's time for us to go.
I'm not done with you yet.

320
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,990
I'm not going.

321
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,110
What did you do that for?

322
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,590
I'm not going anywhere soon.

323
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,590
Well, fuck you.

324
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,590
Come on, Kate.

325
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,790
Let's get out of here.

326
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,150
Come on, where's the key?
Do you have the key?

327
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,710
You mean this?
Yeah.

328
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,590
No.

329
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,670
What did you do
that for?

330
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,270
You don't honestly think
you can escape?

331
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,230
We have to try.

332
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,910
Oh my God.

333
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,790
This is gonna hurt.

334
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,350
Kate,
get the hell up here!

335
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,590
No. I'm not leaving
without him.

336
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,150
For God's sake,
he's a dead man. Move.

337
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,550
God.

338
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,390
There's no time left.
Let's go.

339
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,030
Oh my God.
There's got to be a way.

340
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,110
Get the...
get the hell out of there.

341
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,430
- Oh my God.
- Leave him, he's dead.

342
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,070
Oh my God.

343
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,310
Let me go.

344
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,830
Let me go.

345
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,350
It's still coming.
Come on.

346
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,310
So what the hell happened
back there?

347
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,310
I don't know.

348
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,950
Hello.

349
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,870
And where did you
come from?

350
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,390
What's your name?

351
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,670
I'm... I'm Kate.

352
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,670
Don't you remember me?

353
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,310
I'm Mrs. Paley.

354
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,110
The Colonel was our only link
to this place.

355
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,270
Maybe not.

356
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,910
I designed the door panels
in here.

357
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,670
The touch sensors.

358
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,030
What?

359
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,750
I was freelancing
for a subcontractor, I...

360
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,270
You didn't think this
was worth mentioning before?

361
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,710
I signed a confidentiality...

362
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,470
Given our current situation,
I'd say it's null and void.

363
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,710
- Jesus Christ!
- The legal...

364
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,790
What the hell is
this place?

365
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,030
I don't know.

366
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,590
You don't think the guy that makes
the toilets in the space shuttle,

367
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,230
gets to see the plans
for the rest of it?

368
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,270
You must have had some
idea what they were building.

369
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,190
It was experimental.
It was a prototype.

370
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,150
For what?

371
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,470
- I'm not sure.
- For what?!

372
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,710
Leading-edge stuff.

373
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,510
There were rumors...

374
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,830
What kind of rumors, Jerry?

375
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,190
What rumors?

376
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,070
Quantum teleportation.

377
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,150
Pardon?

378
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,390
They were just rumors.

379
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,230
You mean, like...
"Beam me up, Scotty"?

380
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,190
Okay.

381
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,390
Now this is getting ridiculous.

382
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,590
What do you know, Jerry?

383
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,550
Nothing.

384
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,150
- You're lying.
- Why would I lie?

385
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,870
Because both you and the Colonel
work for them.

386
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,750
Them? Who the hell
are "them" anyway?

387
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,270
What? The government?
The mafia?

388
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,470
Aliens?

389
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,590
Mrs. Paley:
Oh my goodness.

390
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,070
It's a tesseract.

391
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,950
Christ, she's losing it.

392
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,670
Isn't it beautiful?

393
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,670
Isn't what
beautiful, Mrs. Paley?

394
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,310
Holy shit.

395
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,310
If you look at it
from just the right angle...

396
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,510
What did you call it
again, Mrs. Paley?

397
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,470
It's a tesseract, sweetheart.

398
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,670
Tesseract?

399
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,310
Tesseract.

400
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,270
It's...
It's a tesseract.

401
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,190
How do you know
it's a tesser... act,

402
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,430
or whatever
you call it?

403
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,630
Is the second act
beginning already?

404
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,630
We should be getting back
to our seats.

405
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,710
Excuse me.

406
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,910
Yeah.

407
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,950
Is she for real?

408
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,750
A tesseract,
Holy Christ, of course.

409
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,830
A tesseract.

410
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,950
Jerry, you okay?

411
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,270
Yeah, yeah. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

412
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,510
It's been staring at us
in the face the whole time.

413
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,590
Maybe you could share
with the rest of the class.

414
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,230
Oh. Of course.

415
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,430
A tesseract...

416
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,110
it's another name for...

417
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,950
...a hypercube.

418
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,070
A what?

419
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,630
A hypercube...
a four-dimensional cube.

420
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,590
Four dimensions?

421
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,430
All the elements are there.

422
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,390
Rooms repeating.
Rooms folding in on themselves.

423
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,590
Teleportation.

424
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,630
It could all very well
add up.

425
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,270
Look. Here. See?

426
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,430
Let's call one dimension, length,

427
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,350
and represent that
with a simple line.

428
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,310
Now, two dimensions are
length and width,

429
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,270
which can be represented
by a single square.

430
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,950
Now if we extend
that square,

431
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,750
one more dimension...

432
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,310
we get...
a cube,

433
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,670
which has three dimensions.

434
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,350
Length, width, and depth.

435
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,870
Come on, we've all passed
the eighth grade.

436
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,910
Hush.

437
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,350
Here's the really funky part.

438
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,750
If you take this cube,

439
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,990
and extend it one more
dimension,

440
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,710
we get...

441
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,750
A tesseract.

442
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,510
I thought time was considered
to be the fourth dimension.

443
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,110
Sure. That's one idea.

444
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,990
But what if you have
a fourth spatial dimension?

445
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,270
- There's no such thing.
- Why don't you shut up?

446
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,230
Okay. Okay.

447
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,510
Let's just say that
we are in this hyper...

448
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,150
- Cube.
- Cube. Whatever.

449
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,070
Does this diagram
show us how to get out?

450
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,350
Well, uh... no.

451
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,750
A hypercube isn't
supposed to be real.

452
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,110
It's just a theoretical construct.

453
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,590
Oh. Well that makes
me feel better.

454
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,070
Is there a theory on how
we might get out of this...

455
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,590
theoretical construct?

456
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,030
I don't know.

457
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,230
Don't worry, dear.

458
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,510
It's just a matter of time.

459
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,710
That's so much clearer.
Thank you.

460
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,710
Great.

461
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,550
Anyway...

462
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,510
here's my theory
for what it's worth:

463
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,950
We are all...

464
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,270
unwilling participants...
in a game show,

465
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,230
and are being videotaped
as we speak.

466
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,030
Although I don't condone forcible
abduction of innocent people,

467
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,910
we can take comfort in the fact
that once the show airs,

468
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,110
we'll be able to parlay this
into lucrative sponsorship deals.

469
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,030
Okay, Max.

470
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,390
And what's the object
of this game show?

471
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,710
Hmm... I don't know.
To get out alive?

472
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,670
I think
we should make a map.

473
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,790
I don't think a map
is really going to help us.

474
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,430
Look at that.

475
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,070
That wasn't there
a minute ago.

476
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,110
Did you write that?

477
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,750
No. I left my wings
at home.

478
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,670
I just marked this room
as 10 before it.

479
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,750
Somebody's been here
before us.

480
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,710
Thanks.
A really large someone.

481
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,190
Why go through the trouble
of writing it on the ceiling?

482
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,510
60,659 rooms?

483
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,710
Christ.

484
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,350
This place must be huge.

485
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,870
Oh yes, yes.

486
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,190
In a hypercube, there could be
60 million rooms.

487
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,270
She could be right.

488
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,350
There's a comforting thought.

489
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,030
What the hell
are you doing?

490
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,670
Yowza.

491
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,110
The ratings on this show
just doubled.

492
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,430
What do you see?

493
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,870
A girl.

494
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,190
Oh Jesus.

495
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,750
I'm going in.

496
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,630
- I think I'm going to puke.
- You all right?

497
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,110
Okay. I just... whoa...

498
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,310
Hey. Hey. Hey.

499
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,550
- Get back here.
- What's happening?

500
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,710
- What's going on?
- Help!

501
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,230
Simon:
Try to give me your hand.

502
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,230
- Help me!
- You okay?

503
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,550
What the hell
is going on in there?

504
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,710
Max,
don't be an idiot.

505
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,870
- Come on back.
- No, it's okay.

506
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,910
- The gravity shifted.
- She needs help,

507
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,030
- she may be hurt.
- Wow.

508
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,230
Are we going in there or what?

509
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,990
Maybe she knows something.

510
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,750
What about our...

511
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,710
less agile members?

512
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,670
I have an idea.

513
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,630
Hello.

514
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,950
Whoa.

515
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,670
I'm all right.

516
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,070
Miss?

517
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,750
Hey, Miss.

518
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,790
Hey.

519
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,790
Wake up.

520
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,030
She's on her way.

521
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,310
I guess it's time
for plan B.

522
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,110
Give her mouth-to-mouth
and see if it works.

523
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,590
Think I should?

524
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,670
Oh, very funny.

525
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,430
Hi.

526
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,030
What's wrong?

527
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,630
What the hell?

528
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,110
Where am I?

529
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,110
That's the million dollar question.

530
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,590
Does she have
to keep cackling like that?

531
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,230
Come on,
let's get this over with.

532
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,910
All right. This is going
to be some kind of...

533
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,150
Yeah, Mrs. Paley.
Just keep laughing there.

534
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,710
This is more fun
than I've had since

535
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,990
my thirteenth birthday.

536
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,630
Glad somebody is having fun.

537
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,590
This reminds me
of that rope swing

538
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,470
we used to have
at home.

539
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,990
For God's sake, Mrs. Paley,
this isn't a game!

540
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,710
Come on.
Come on down.

541
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,190
Simon, you guys,
keep her steady.

542
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,670
All right, all right.
Come on.

543
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,150
Okay. And you're down.
That's good.

544
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,430
It's okay.
She's down.

545
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,670
- We've landed.
- Yeah.

546
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,190
It's your turn, you'll
have to climb around the sides.

547
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,870
Well, this is a lot
like the other ones, isn't it?

548
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,270
Christ.
This is going to be fun.

549
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,750
Hello there.
I'm Mrs. Paley.

550
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,030
Who the hell
are you people?!

551
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,190
Well...

552
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,030
I'm Kate,
and this is Mrs. Paley.

553
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,750
And I am Julia.

554
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,590
And this is...

555
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,310
Hey. Is this your jacket?

556
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,670
No.

557
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,150
Well then how did I...

558
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,310
I must have had more
to drink last night than I thought.

559
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,950
There's nothing in here.

560
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,950
How the hell did I get here?

561
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,630
Have we been kidnapped?

562
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,870
That's a really good question.

563
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,550
Does anyone remember
how we got here?

564
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,590
Last thing I remember
was going to sleep.

565
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,870
Where?

566
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,710
In my bed.

567
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,670
Where do you live?

568
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,270
Lincoln, Nebraska.

569
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,950
Kate, I am a healthy, married,
male white engineer,

570
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,870
who enjoys reading horror novels
and eating chocolate ice cream,

571
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,790
as well as climbing around
psycho-jungle-gyms.

572
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,070
Okay.

573
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,990
I remember driving home
from Maine State Hospital.

574
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,830
It was late,
and I just wanted to get home,

575
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,790
I've been working long hours.
I'm a psychotherapist.

576
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,390
Simon.

577
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:07,990
New Haven.

578
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,870
I was out for a drink.

579
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,350
What do you do?

580
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,150
A consultant.

581
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,190
Management consultant.

582
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,870
Yeah, right.

583
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,950
And I'm Santa Claus.

584
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,070
Okay, Max.
How about you?

585
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,470
I live in Palo Alto.
I design computer games.

586
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,430
The last thing I remember,
I fell asleep on my keyboard.

587
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,950
Sasha.

588
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,430
And where do you live?

589
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,430
New Mexico.

590
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,550
I was doing my homework
in the kitchen, like I always do.

591
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,990
Nothing ever happens to me.

592
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,950
The last thing I remember...

593
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,110
is taking the dog
for a walk.

594
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,990
Julia?

595
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:04,230
I was at an after party
for a premiere in Santa Monica.

596
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,110
Are you an actress?

597
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,150
No.

598
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,470
No, I'm an attorney.

599
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,110
Let's just say if I was kidnapped
it was for the ransom.

600
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,510
So we've got Silicon Valley,
Connecticut, Nebraska,

601
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,030
Hollywood, Maine.

602
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,950
Mrs. Paley,
where exactly do you live?

603
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,590
In that high-rise at the corner
of Riverside and 94th.

604
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,710
Could you give me
a lift home, dear?

605
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,510
I seem to have lost
my daughter-in-law.

606
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,990
Ignorance is bliss.

607
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,030
This doesn't make any sense.

608
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,270
Yeah, well...

609
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,310
I think they probably
flew us here.

610
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:43,990
Drugged us and flew us out here
in private or military jets.

611
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,750
That's what I think.

612
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,870
- Where is here?
- I don't know.

613
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,190
Your guess
is as good as mine.

614
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:53,590
They could have built
an hypercube structure anywhere.

615
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,550
And if this thing
really does fold space,

616
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,670
we could be
literately anywhere.

617
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,710
What the hell...

618
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,310
What?

619
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,470
Here is that number again.

620
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,270
6-0-6-5-9

621
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,910
This can't be the same room.
Jesus!

622
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,190
It's not, because now they're
in a string of other numbers.

623
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,510
There just can't be
that many rooms.

624
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,950
Maybe they are not
room numbers.

625
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,750
Maybe somebody else
figured something out.

626
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,790
We are definitely
not alone.

627
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,110
Check this out.

628
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,630
What is it?

629
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,630
What's happening?

630
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,030
Julia,
is that your watch?

631
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,310
No.

632
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,190
No, it's mine.

633
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,470
It...

634
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,310
Well, this is bizarre.

635
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,870
What, somebody else
uses a watch just like yours?

636
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,230
Somebody is playing games
with us.

637
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,790
Shit... look...

638
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:55,790
this is the watch that my wife
gave me on my 40th.

639
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,910
See?

640
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,630
This is the watch
we've just found.

641
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,230
Maybe it's your game
that we are playing, Jerry.

642
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,750
You designed the doors,
your watch. What's next?

643
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,750
- No, I...
- For the love of God, Mrs. Paley...

644
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,190
Mrs. Paley, please don't.

645
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,710
Oh, my goodness,
I think he's still alive.

646
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,790
- Mrs. Paley, please.
- Get her down.

647
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,070
Easy, careful.

648
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,950
Max:
Is somebody in there?

649
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,270
- What do you see?
- Jerry?

650
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,830
Oh, God.
There's a guy down here.

651
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,830
Oh!

652
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,070
- The gravity's shifting.
- What's happening?

653
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,390
You okay?
Are you all right?

654
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,030
Simon,
what's going on?

655
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,150
My God.

656
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,630
Hey, hey, fellow.

657
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,190
Oh, Jesus.

658
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,710
- Be careful.
- Ugh!

659
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,670
- Is he alive?
- I don't think so.

660
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,670
- Let's roll him over.
- Yeah, yeah...

661
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,670
Jerry:
Oh God, is he ripe.

662
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,030
What... what is that?

663
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,030
Oh!
It looks pretty dead to me.

664
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,230
Mrs. Paley:
I hope he's still alive.

665
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,390
He's been here
for a while, Mrs. Paley.

666
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,630
Mrs. Paley:
Oh, poor man.

667
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,270
Who do you think
wrote these numbers?

668
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,430
He must have written them himself,
It's all upside down.

669
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,950
It's the same writing
as those numbers we keep seeing.

670
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,870
Oh, no!

671
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,390
It's poor Dr. Rosenzweig.

672
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,270
You know him?

673
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,910
He'll never get
his Nobel Prize now.

674
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,870
- Who the hell is he?
- Holy Christ...

675
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,110
Phil Rosenzweig.

676
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,150
Last year he was the leading
theoretical physicist in his field.

677
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,030
- Which was?
- Quantum chaos.

678
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,150
Oh God, Phil Rosenzweig.
I read his book...

679
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,750
- Oh Jesus.
- Oh my God.

680
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,310
Is he...?

681
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,030
Kate, is he...?

682
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,150
- Yeah, he's gone.
- You are positive?

683
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,750
Uh-huh.

684
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,510
Somebody...?

685
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,390
I'm here, Sasha.
Got you.

686
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,310
Does anyone understand
these numbers?

687
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,510
What was he writing?

688
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,830
Beats me.

689
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,070
May be he was trying to calculate
his way out of here.

690
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,470
Looks like
he ran out of time.

691
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,150
How did old Mrs. Paley
know him?

692
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,110
- I don't know.
- Hey, look. More numbers.

693
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,910
Same handwriting.

694
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,750
The question is,
did he solve it before he died?

695
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,310
God. She's okay.
Are you okay?

696
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,950
He must have
finished it here.

697
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,190
Look, there it is again...
6-0-6-5-9.

698
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,150
How does that
get us out of here?

699
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,550
- It's got to mean something.
- Yeah, but what?

700
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,190
I don't know,
but we better remember it.

701
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:42,430
You know, I wonder
if is he's got a...

702
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,750
What are you doing?
That's disgusting.

703
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,790
Found a pen.

704
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,150
Hope you have better luck
than he did.

705
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,150
Oh no,
this can't be happening.

706
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,470
Oh dear.

707
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,830
Oh dear, just wait.

708
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,670
Oh, I'm such an idiot.
Oh, no. Wait a minute.

709
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
She's gonna drive me
insane.
Oh,
it was right here.
- What is it, Mrs. Paley?
- Izon, where are you?

710
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,630
I'm such an idiot.

711
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,270
- Did she say Izon?
- Izon, where are you?

712
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,070
You come back here
this instant.

713
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,390
Who are you looking for
Mrs. Paley?

714
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,750
Have you seen
my dog?

715
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,990
He's a darling little Shi-Tzu.
Darn it.

716
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:30,310
Her dog's name is "Izon"?
That's weird.

717
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,710
I thought
Izon was a...

718
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,350
Simon and Jerry:
A weapons manufacturer.

719
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,430
Yes.

720
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,830
And you guys
would know that because...

721
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,990
I read the papers.

722
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:51,190
- Mrs. Paley...
- Poor puppy...

723
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:54,630
Mrs. Paley, are you sure
you didn't leave the dog at home?

724
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:58,070
No. He was right here.
I'm such an idiot.

725
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,550
Simon:
This breaks my heart.

726
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,750
Mrs. Paley...

727
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,110
Mrs. Paley,
what do you do for living?

728
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,150
Oh, nothing.
I'm retired.

729
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,350
I shouldn't have let him
off the leash.

730
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,030
Before you retired,
what did you do?

731
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,070
Nothing very exciting.
I was a theoretical mathematician.

732
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,830
Where did you work?

733
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,830
Oh, my head hurts.

734
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,830
At Skippy
Research Affiliates...

735
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,670
what do they called it?
A think-tank in Washington state.

736
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,670
She worked for
Skippy Research Affiliates

737
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,550
and her dog's name
was Izon?

738
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,710
- Mrs. Paley?
- Hmm?

739
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:40,310
Is it possible that you worked
for Izon Research Affiliates

740
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,510
and your dog's name
is Skippy?

741
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,790
How did you know
where I worked?

742
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,310
Oh, God.

743
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,190
She worked
for a weapons manufacturer?

744
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,950
She's a good friend
of our Nobel wanna-be.

745
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:57,630
I don't think we should trust
Mrs. Funnyfarm.

746
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,950
I'm not crazy, and I'm not
hard of hearing either.

747
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,710
I told you no one
would believe me.

748
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,950
Mrs. Paley,

749
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,310
what sort of research
did you do at Izon?

750
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,550
General, I will not be party
to this insanity!

751
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,790
I'm not a general.

752
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,870
I don't care what
Alex Trusk says.

753
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,670
It's impossible.
And what's more, it's inhuman.

754
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,710
- Who's Alex?
- Did she say Alex Trusk?

755
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,830
Oh Christ.
We're dead.

756
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,630
This is really
getting ridiculous.

757
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,150
Who's Alex Trusk?

758
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,550
Alex Trusk? Hacker extraordinare?
He's a legend.

759
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,870
This is exactly the kind
of twisted maze he'd create.

760
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,990
Alex Trusk
doesn't even exist.

761
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,350
Some things
should never be created.

762
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,190
They exist
for theoretical purposes only.

763
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:46,430
It would never last.
Can't you understand that?

764
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,710
Okay, you're a shrink.

765
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:53,110
Can you tell me
what the hell's happening?

766
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,510
I... umm...

767
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,950
I'd say that
seeing the dead man

768
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,830
triggered some sort
of emotional response.

769
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,350
Flashbacks,
post-traumatic stress...

770
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,190
So she is connected
to this, yeah?

771
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,830
Skippy...

772
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:09,790
Ooh,
I think I hear him.

773
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,230
Skippy?

774
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:13,390
Mrs. Paley,
Mrs. Paley, don't...

775
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,590
Skippy?

776
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,430
Mrs. Paley.

777
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,190
Oh my.

778
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:32,790
Help me, please.

779
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:35,750
Uh, uh.

780
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,870
No, don't trust
the old cunt.

781
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,630
She lied
about everything.

782
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,790
What a... Jesus.

783
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:50,190
Sasha:
What just happened?

784
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,710
It took my head, man.

785
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,070
I lost my fucking head!

786
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,750
Paley opened...

787
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,830
the portal...

788
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,430
Wait, wait,
I have an idea.

789
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:13,030
I think we're all tired.
We need to calm down, everybody.

790
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,230
Hold it. Wait a minute!

791
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,710
I have an idea.

792
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:20,350
Let me guess,
you designed the floor too.

793
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,630
You better have a really
good fucking explanation, Jerry.

794
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:25,110
I know what just
happened there was a little...

795
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,350
shocking, but it actually
makes total sense if we're...

796
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,750
in a really multi-dimensional
quantum environment.

797
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,230
English, please.

798
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:37,030
One fundamental idea
of a quantum universe,

799
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:40,830
is that parallel realities
can actually exist simultaneously.

800
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,070
How do you know that,
Jerry?

801
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,110
All you designed
were the door panels!

802
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,710
I read it in
Rosenzweig book,

803
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,590
it was a big part
of this theory.

804
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,510
What if whoever designed
this stinking thing

805
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,550
somehow managed to create
a place where parallel realities

806
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,630
can crossover like that?

807
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,510
So you are saying
we just saw Simon and Mrs. Paley

808
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:00,430
- in a parallel universe?
- Yes, yes!

809
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,670
Stop it!

810
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,110
A universe where things
turn out a little differently.

811
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,870
- Fuck.
- Uh, please.

812
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,710
Think about it,
think about it.

813
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,590
A few minutes before,

814
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,310
- when you found the watch,
- Yeah.

815
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,150
And we realized
that somebody else

816
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,270
had been marking numbers
in the rooms, right?

817
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:18,070
That's when I thought maybe
we should leave markers behind,

818
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,350
in case we doubled back
and got side-tracked.

819
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,550
Things like a piece of clothing
or jewelry.

820
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,830
I think what a pity it would be
to leave my watch.

821
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,030
But I would do it
if I had to.

822
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,670
You're saying
that in an alternate reality

823
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,470
we'd already gotten ourselves
into such trouble

824
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,430
that you decided that is okay
to leave your watch?

825
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,150
- Yes!
- For crying out loud!

826
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,230
What a load of crap!

827
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,630
There's got to be
a logical explanation.

828
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,390
What would you think
that is?

829
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,150
This is just an optical illusion
or something?

830
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:45,670
Yeah, sure.
Why not?

831
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,990
Finally, yeah.
A sane idea.

832
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,590
Kate:
Oh, that's a sane idea.

833
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:50,550
All right.

834
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,590
If Max is right, why don't you
go and open that door?

835
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,390
- Oh, come on.
- Have a look.

836
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:56,430
Excuse me?

837
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,390
If you're so sure
it's an optical illusion,

838
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,270
open the door
and have a look.

839
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:13,470
You might want to stand
to the side, in case that thing...

840
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,110
Fuck off, Jerry!

841
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,350
Okay, hold it!

842
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,430
All right?
Don't open it.

843
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,390
Say Jerry's right,

844
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:35,350
I think all of this
is a hoax, okay?

845
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:38,310
I think Jerry's either full
of shit or part of this experiment.

846
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:40,470
- Simon, I never...
- Shut the fuck up!

847
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,270
I'm agreeing with you, Max.

848
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:46,310
I think we're all pumped
so full of LSD

849
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:48,710
and I think we're hidden
in some CIA hospital

850
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,390
in Area 51, or whatever.

851
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:52,070
But let's just say,
on the off- chance

852
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,470
that Jerry is actually right.

853
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:58,390
Then what happens if whatever
the fuck it was in there

854
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:59,710
that killed the guy,
killed me,

855
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,070
what happens if
that fucking thing gets in here?!

856
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,950
What happens then?!

857
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:06,710
You're all crazy.

858
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,870
Hey, man,
what are you doing?

859
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,990
Just don't
fucking open the door.

860
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,070
What are you
so scared of anyway?

861
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:17,110
I just saw my fucking head
taken off by something or other.

862
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,350
How's that for starters?

863
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,190
Where did you get
that knife?

864
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,870
It's mine.

865
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:26,710
I collect knives.

866
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:29,110
He had it when
I first saw him.

867
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,990
- He sure did.
- That's convenient.

868
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,790
He's the only guy
with a knife here,

869
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:35,350
if anyone was a part
of the experiment... maybe you.

870
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,510
I know! I know!
I've got it! I've got it!

871
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,350
Why don't we all just

872
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,870
get some ice cream

873
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,990
and everyone will feel
a lot better about everything?

874
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,990
You're funny, Mrs. Paley.
You really are a funny old lady.

875
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:55,190
You're also cute and senile.

876
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,430
You leave her alone,
she doesn't understand.

877
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,350
All right, she's already admitted
working for Izon,

878
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:03,230
one of the most powerful weapons
manufacturers in the world.

879
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:05,470
She recognized
the figures on the wall,

880
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:06,910
and she knew the dead guy.

881
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:10,070
No. Maybe my alter ego
wasn't all that wrong.

882
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:13,430
Maybe we shouldn't trust
dear old Mrs. Paley.

883
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,070
Maybe you're the one
we shouldn't trust.

884
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:18,150
I beg your pardon?

885
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:23,390
Maybe you're the one
we shouldn't trust.

886
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:25,310
Oh.

887
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,550
I'm going to ignore that,
little girl,

888
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,350
because you're a cripple.

889
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,990
I think we should
keep moving, huh?

890
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,390
After you.

891
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,710
Sasha:
Kate, I'm really thirsty.

892
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,670
Me too, sweetheart.
Me too.

893
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,150
I'm exhausted.
Are we there yet?

894
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:17,910
Come on, Mrs. Paley.
Just hold on a little longer.

895
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,430
Who's this
Alex Trusk person?

896
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:39,910
Are you kidding?

897
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,150
He programmed the virus
that crashed

898
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:44,750
the Tokyo stock exchange
two years ago.

899
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,470
He's the one that broke into
the Air Traffic Control Grid,

900
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,830
and crashed those two
Air Force jets in Nevada

901
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,950
to protest military spending.

902
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,070
You forgot the one
about Alex Trusk

903
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,630
being the first genetically
engineered superhuman,

904
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,950
bred in a test tube, who now
lives and walks amongst us.

905
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:03,430
That sounds
a bit far-fetched.

906
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:04,710
Don't worry.

907
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:08,150
Alex Trusk is a conspiracy
theorist's wet dream.

908
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,630
He doesn't exist.

909
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:12,230
Fine.
Just keep fooling yourself.

910
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:15,390
Would you people
just shut up and keep moving?

911
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,390
Do you really
believe this stuff

912
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:23,590
about parallel universes?

913
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,230
If you asked me yesterday,
I'd say no.

914
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,710
But this place changes your
perception about what's possible.

915
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,390
Look, let's just keep this
between us for now.

916
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:36,390
Yeah. Okay.

917
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:41,070
Here's the deal.
I'm a private investigator.

918
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:43,590
I'm on a case,
missing persons.

919
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:48,630
Given our current situation,
this counts as irony.

920
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,590
You're right.

921
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:53,590
I think they stuck me in here
because of her...

922
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:55,590
Becky Young.

923
00:50:55,670 --> 00:51:00,030
They've emptied my pockets
except for my knife and this.

924
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:02,030
Maybe it's a message
or a warning.

925
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,910
Here's the kicker.

926
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:09,270
Guess who she worked for?

927
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:15,310
Izon?

928
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:21,430
Kate.

929
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:25,190
Kate.

930
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:28,590
Kate, you have to wake up,
there's...

931
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,310
What is it?
What's wrong?

932
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,510
There's something here.

933
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,950
Do you see anything?

934
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:38,110
You're probably just
dreaming or some...

935
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:40,630
Whoa.

936
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:43,830
There is...

937
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:45,750
there is something.

938
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:47,670
What the hell
is that?

939
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:51,870
Kate.

940
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:55,830
Kate, what do you see?

941
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:58,910
It's a square.
It's just floating.

942
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,590
What is it?

943
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,150
It's beautiful.

944
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:04,110
You recognize this too,
Mrs. Paley?

945
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,070
Well, not exactly...

946
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,950
- What just happened?
- Now there's two.

947
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:09,030
It's multiplying.

948
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:11,670
- Oh my God...
- Maybe it's the way out.

949
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,390
Oh. Wow.

950
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,950
If we're drunk,
I wanna know what this stuff is.

951
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:18,750
Maybe that's what a
four-dimensional object looks like.

952
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,590
If that's the way out,
how do we use it?

953
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:26,590
I hate it.
It sounds wrong.

954
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,670
It's stunning.

955
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,595
The math of it.

956
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:36,510
It's a perfect
quadrangular oscillation.

957
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,030
It's moving.
Mrs. Paley, no!

958
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,190
Ahh.

959
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,350
Get the fuck out
of the way!

960
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:49,470
Jerry, you're hurt.

961
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:51,070
No. I'm okay.

962
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,030
Look out.

963
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,510
Stay low.

964
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:00,110
Whoa! Go on.

965
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,110
Come on, Mrs. Paley.
It's time to go.

966
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:08,190
Over here.
It looks safe.

967
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:17,430
- Don't stare at it. Go.
- It's coming back.

968
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:19,630
Come on, Max.

969
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:21,190
Go, Julia. Go.

970
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,470
- I want to get it.
- No. We've got to go.

971
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:29,750
Oh my God. Go.
Go up the stairs.

972
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:33,670
Come on, Mrs. Paley.
Keep going...

973
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:37,950
Kate!

974
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:38,910
Sasha.

975
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:43,670
Jerry.

976
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,270
- Oh Jesus!
- No.

977
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,630
- Sasha.
- No. Just don't do it.

978
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,670
- Just get in here.
- What the fuck are you doing?

979
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,710
Kate!

980
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:58,270
She's gone. You want
to end up like Jerry?

981
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,190
- Sasha.
- Kate!

982
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:04,390
Kate, I'm here.

983
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,350
Kate.

984
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:07,190
You're a dead woman.

985
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,270
Oh... oh Jesus.

986
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:16,590
Sasha.

987
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:19,790
Kate, help.

988
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,270
- Kate, help!
- I'm coming to get you.

989
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:26,350
Help me!

990
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,150
Drop to the ground, Sasha.
Now.

991
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:31,350
Help me.

992
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,750
Okay, Sasha.

993
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:39,710
Now... uh...
I can see you, Sasha.

994
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:42,510
Flatten yourself
against the wall, on the ground.

995
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,990
- Crawl towards me.
- No. I can't. I'm scared.

996
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:47,550
You've gotta move,
or I can't come and get you.

997
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:49,630
Move towards me.

998
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,230
No. Stop, Sasha!

999
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:53,110
Don't, Sasha.

1000
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:54,070
Get down.

1001
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,150
Damn it, Kate,
what do you want me to do?

1002
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:00,230
Just keep moving until
you hit that corner,

1003
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,510
and then stay put.

1004
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:03,270
Okay?

1005
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,590
Sasha?

1006
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:09,470
Okay?
I'm almost there.

1007
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:14,350
Just crawl on. Keep your side
to the ground. You can do it.

1008
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:16,350
You've made it.
I'm right behind you.

1009
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:18,510
There you are.
Keep your knees in.

1010
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:20,990
Kate, thank God.

1011
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,750
There you are. You're okay.
You're okay...

1012
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,790
What just happened?

1013
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:46,710
I don't know.

1014
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:48,590
I don't know, Sasha.

1015
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:06,830
Sweet Jesus.

1016
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,910
It's shrinking
so it can get us.

1017
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:11,590
Please let it be quick.

1018
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:12,710
Okay.

1019
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,750
We're going to make
a run for it.

1020
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:17,150
- I can't.
- Yes you can. Just hold onto me.

1021
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:18,990
We're going to go
to our right.

1022
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,150
No. We're going to go
to the left.

1023
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:22,630
All right?

1024
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,070
- Okay?
- Okay.

1025
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:26,550
On the count of three...
just hold on to me.

1026
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:32,070
One, two, three...

1027
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,910
I've got you.

1028
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,070
Oh my God!

1029
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,150
Sasha, no.

1030
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,750
It responds
to our movements.

1031
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,710
Don't move.

1032
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:14,670
Stay still.

1033
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:16,150
Don't...

1034
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:28,630
Oh my God.

1035
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,750
Is it gone?

1036
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:32,710
Yeah. It's gone.

1037
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,910
Thank you.

1038
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,910
We did it together. Let's get out
of here before it comes back.

1039
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:38,870
My glasses.

1040
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:41,350
You're glasses are gone.
Just go up the ladder.

1041
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,750
- Kate.
- Yeah? What?

1042
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:45,590
- I can smell it.
- What?

1043
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,510
Did someone die in here?

1044
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:49,070
Yeah.

1045
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,430
- Yeah. Jerry died.
- Oh no.

1046
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,910
He was so nice.

1047
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:00,470
We've got to go.
We've got to go, honey.

1048
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,510
Just get up there.
One foot after the other.

1049
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:05,110
- Where are the others?
- I think we're on our own.

1050
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,510
You're doing good.

1051
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:30,670
I see a pattern.

1052
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:33,830
Anyone connected to this...

1053
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:37,070
this hypercube...

1054
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:40,710
eventually dies a very violent,

1055
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,830
and painful death.

1056
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:54,430
I would hate for that
to happen to you, Mrs. Paley.

1057
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:58,230
I would.

1058
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:59,830
So drop the act

1059
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,870
and tell us how
we get out of here.

1060
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:04,950
Huh?

1061
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:06,030
Simon.

1062
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:07,430
Simon, that's enough.

1063
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:08,990
- Shut up.
- Hey, Simon...

1064
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:10,550
- Shut up.
- Okay.

1065
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:16,510
Okay, Mrs. Paley.
You ready to talk?

1066
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,350
'Cause I'm all ears.

1067
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:25,590
I really don't need
this operation, Doctor.

1068
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:27,070
I'm in perfect health.

1069
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:29,590
Just ask my daughter-in-law
over there. She'll explain.

1070
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,190
This joke's really getting stale.

1071
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,550
I'm going to give you one
more chance, Mrs. Paley.

1072
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:36,510
You tell me what
I need to know,

1073
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:38,390
or I'm going to have
to kill you.

1074
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:41,190
Do you understand?
I'm going to kill you.

1075
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:42,910
It's your choice.

1076
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:44,510
Get away from her!

1077
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:47,310
You have a choice to make.
Right now.

1078
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:49,630
Do you want to get out
of here or not?

1079
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:51,750
- Yes, but...
- There are no buts!

1080
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:53,390
Hey guys, maybe...

1081
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:56,470
All right.

1082
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,950
Oh shit.

1083
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,510
It's here.

1084
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,550
It's gonna take
my head off.

1085
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,110
Let's go.

1086
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,870
What about Mrs. Paley?

1087
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:09,950
Goddamn it.

1088
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:12,430
- I'm not gonna die here.
- You can't leave her.

1089
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:15,190
- Why should I help her?
- She'll die.

1090
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,150
- Forget about her.
- I'm gonna regret this.

1091
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:18,430
Julia!

1092
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:22,470
- I'm trying to get this off.
- Come on. Hurry.

1093
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:24,670
Shit!
Would someone give me a hand?

1094
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:26,430
Would somebody help me
pick her up?

1095
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:28,870
Shit!

1096
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:30,510
Let go of me.

1097
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:31,470
Shit!

1098
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:34,110
I'm not staying here.
I'm out of here.

1099
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:35,350
Let go of me.

1100
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:36,830
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh my God.

1101
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,190
Oh God.

1102
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,270
Where do you think
you're going?

1103
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:09,670
Hurry up.

1104
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:15,070
Get back here.

1105
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:31,750
What the hell?

1106
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:50,710
6-0-6-5-9.

1107
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:54,790
It could mean anything.

1108
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,630
Right.

1109
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:00,070
Maybe it's a coordinate of
some kind but in four dimensions.

1110
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,270
Some...

1111
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,950
I don't know.

1112
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,470
For all we know,

1113
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,510
it could be somebody's birthday,

1114
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,150
or a zip code,

1115
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:10,470
or just a serial number.

1116
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:15,190
I wish I was just...
smarter.

1117
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:21,670
Why do you think
you're in here?

1118
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:25,230
I don't know.

1119
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:27,630
Maybe I was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

1120
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:32,350
Damn it. There's got to be
some sort of meaning to this.

1121
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:36,710
6-0-6-5-9.

1122
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:39,870
Maybe they just like
to watch us squirm.

1123
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:53,710
Alex Trusk is the only one
with the resources

1124
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:56,710
and brains to create
something like this.

1125
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:58,750
Okay, Max.
Say you're right.

1126
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:01,910
Say it is Alex Trusk who's
responsible for all of this.

1127
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:04,070
Does it help us get out?

1128
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:07,030
No, we're still stuck here,
with no clue.

1129
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:11,350
And if this is someone's game,
it isn't a fair one.

1130
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:13,870
Max, do you think...

1131
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:18,550
We've got to keep moving.
Come on.

1132
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:22,550
Max?

1133
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:29,950
Max, what's wrong with you?

1134
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:47,390
Holy shit!
Variable time-speed rooms.

1135
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:50,710
- Pretty wild.
- I guess you could say that.

1136
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:12,550
Holy jumping Jesus!

1137
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:14,350
Get your hands
off me.

1138
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,150
- Hello, Jerry.
- Who the hell are you?

1139
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:17,790
- You don't recognize me?
- Where am I?

1140
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:20,150
- How do you know my name?
- You don't know me?

1141
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:21,950
No.
Where the hell am I?

1142
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:22,990
You don't...?

1143
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:24,070
Wait, wait.

1144
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,550
You don't remember me?

1145
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,110
- No.
- What about the senile old broad,

1146
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:31,230
- or the little blind kid?
- What?

1147
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:33,670
Or that thing that chopped
you up like little pieces

1148
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,510
of deli fucking meat?

1149
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:38,190
I'm a friend...
I mean you no harm.

1150
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,630
Let me go,
and I'll be on my way.

1151
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,190
No come on, you...

1152
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:47,070
You mean me no harm?
You're fucking hilarious, Jerry.

1153
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:50,470
How long
have you been in here?

1154
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:52,990
I don't know.
I just woke up.

1155
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:55,750
You just woke up?

1156
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:57,750
Holy shit!

1157
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:59,510
Holy shit.

1158
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:01,670
Maybe you were
right before, huh?

1159
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:04,590
You or the...
whatever...

1160
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:08,910
This place does crossover
parallel alternate realities, huh?

1161
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:11,190
Have you been drinking?

1162
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:17,270
I really don't give
a shit anymore.

1163
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:19,910
We are talking
about alternate realities.

1164
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:27,070
Can I ask you
a question?

1165
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:28,590
Do you mind?

1166
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:30,670
Yeah, okay, sure...

1167
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,830
just don't hurt me, huh?

1168
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:36,830
Are you hungry?

1169
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:38,830
Are you... hungry?

1170
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:45,750
Yeah, I guess...
my stomach's...

1171
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:50,710
'Cause I am hungry.

1172
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:53,710
I'm fucking starving.

1173
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:33,910
Oh my God.

1174
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:38,470
Kate, what is it?

1175
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,590
Kate?

1176
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:51,470
What do you see?

1177
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:02,510
Kate,
what's going on?

1178
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:06,310
I don't know.
I mean...

1179
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:11,590
I think in some other reality,
things didn't turn out so well.

1180
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:26,430
Again with the Alex Trusk?

1181
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,790
Why are you so afraid
of this Alex Trusk?

1182
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:32,790
Because he's ruthless.
He's a hi-tech genius

1183
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:34,710
whose morals make
Muammar Qaddafi

1184
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,470
look like Mother Teresa.

1185
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,230
Why are you panicking?

1186
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:42,190
Because he's throwing anybody
connected to this thing in here

1187
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:44,470
to fucking die!

1188
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:46,470
Max,
you're not connected.

1189
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:55,390
Can you
keep a secret?

1190
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:58,870
Sure.
I love secrets.

1191
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:03,550
I designed a computer game
called "Relativity,"

1192
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:07,510
where contestants linked
to each over the Internet

1193
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:09,870
do battle in a 3-D environment,

1194
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:12,230
using different time signatures.

1195
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:15,270
What are you saying?

1196
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:18,110
Are you saying
that you designed all this?

1197
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:20,150
No. Just these
variable time speeds rooms.

1198
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:21,910
Just the concept.

1199
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:24,590
It was for a game.
Now here we are.

1200
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:25,550
Wow.

1201
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:27,470
This is really
some game, Max.

1202
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:30,670
Do you have other little secrets
you want to tell me?

1203
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:32,190
People are dead,
okay?

1204
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:33,990
I'm not responsible
for this.

1205
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:35,910
It was just a game.

1206
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,990
I can't even sell
the stupid thing.

1207
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:40,230
It's all involved
in a lawsuit.

1208
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,190
What kind of lawsuit?

1209
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:43,830
I don't know,
some...

1210
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,990
Right, you're a lawyer.

1211
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:50,590
A company called Cyber Thrill
stole it from me.

1212
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:53,550
Cyber Thrill?

1213
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,830
You've heard of them?

1214
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:57,110
Yeah.

1215
01:08:57,150 --> 01:08:59,070
Are you into
computer games?

1216
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:02,950
Settle.

1217
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:04,670
Excuse me?

1218
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:09,070
I strongly recommend that
you settle. You'll never win.

1219
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:12,150
- How do you know that?
- Because...

1220
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:14,470
you're not up against
Cyber Thrill.

1221
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,550
They're just a subsidiary.

1222
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:18,670
Who owns them?

1223
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,310
Izon.

1224
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:22,910
How do you know that?

1225
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:25,110
Because I...

1226
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:27,030
represent them.

1227
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:03,670
I must be
hearing things.

1228
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:20,470
Finally.

1229
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:22,990
I was wondering if I was
the only one in here.

1230
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:25,510
Do you need
a hand there?

1231
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:27,270
You are upside-down.

1232
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:30,870
Do you have any idea
what's going on here?

1233
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:32,470
Be careful.
Watch your step.

1234
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:34,710
Crazy.

1235
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,590
You are not
the only person here, Jerry.

1236
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:40,390
There's lots of people
just like you.

1237
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,590
How do you know
my name?

1238
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:46,230
We've met before,
Jerry.

1239
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:49,430
I get this mouth-watering feeling
when I talk to you.

1240
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:52,350
- What do you mean?
- Come here, look at this.

1241
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:53,510
Hey, hey. Agh!

1242
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:56,190
- Agh, no!
- Take this! And this!

1243
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,150
Why don't you
just go?

1244
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:06,190
I'm blind, Kate.

1245
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:08,230
I'm a burden.

1246
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:11,390
You can move faster
without me.

1247
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:13,710
Sasha, please,
I know how you're feeling.

1248
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:16,790
No you don't.
You have no idea how I'm feeling.

1249
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:19,190
- I know this seems hopeless
- It is hopeless.

1250
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:21,950
No, it's not.
I'm gonna figure this out.

1251
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:28,390
"Figure it out."

1252
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:30,270
Trust me, precious.

1253
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:32,110
If I haven't
figured it out,

1254
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:35,190
you sure as shit
aren't going to.

1255
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:37,110
What did you
just say?

1256
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,710
I'm sorry, Kate.
I didn't mean to...

1257
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:41,950
No, no.
Wait a second.

1258
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:43,990
Back that up.

1259
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:47,630
Why do you think
that you should be able

1260
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:49,830
to figure this out?

1261
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:54,990
I wasn't kidnapped.

1262
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:58,710
When I found out they were
putting people in here,

1263
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:00,830
I tried to blow
the whistle on them.

1264
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:02,790
So they came after me.

1265
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:06,670
I escaped into the one place
they wouldn't dare follow me...

1266
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,630
in here.

1267
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:11,630
Poetic justice,
don't you think?

1268
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,990
Who are you?

1269
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:19,590
Max was right.

1270
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,710
Jerry was wrong.

1271
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:23,630
I exist.

1272
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:25,790
Oh my God.

1273
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:27,670
Sasha. Of course.

1274
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,790
Sasha is the nickname
for Alexandra.

1275
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:31,950
Alex Trusk.

1276
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:34,870
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

1277
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:42,030
Damn it.

1278
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:45,230
This is the worst nightmare
I've ever had.

1279
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,750
I just I wish I'd wake up.

1280
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:50,470
You really think
this is all a dream?

1281
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:14,350
Definitely.

1282
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,910
In the real world
I'd never kiss you.

1283
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:19,830
Oh, really?

1284
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,230
Yeah,
you're not my type.

1285
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:26,710
You're not my type,
either.

1286
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:32,230
Aa-ah!

1287
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:34,110
Ya-aa!

1288
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:35,830
Becky Young.

1289
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:37,230
Yeah.

1290
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:41,190
Rebecca Young.

1291
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:42,670
Yeah.

1292
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:45,350
Who... are you?

1293
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:51,870
Who am I?
I'm Simon Grady.

1294
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:55,310
Your parents hired me
to find you.

1295
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:56,990
- Really?
- Yeah.

1296
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:58,990
Thank God.

1297
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:00,310
Yeah.

1298
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:04,150
I'm happy to see you too, Becky.
I really am.

1299
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:07,150
I've been wandering these rooms
for hours.

1300
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:09,710
Ahhgh!

1301
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:22,110
You gotta love
these parallel universes.

1302
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:27,150
You built this thing?

1303
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:29,230
I gave them the key
to build it...

1304
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:31,110
better than they wanted.

1305
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:33,150
I gave them a real hypercube.

1306
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,710
How do we get out?

1307
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:37,790
Kate, this isn't a game.
There's no happy ending.

1308
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:42,910
This place is out of control.
It's not stable.

1309
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,350
Does this number
mean nothing?

1310
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:48,790
6-0-6-5-9.
It's got to mean something.

1311
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:50,710
It's everywhere.

1312
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:53,990
I'm sorry, Kate.
It's over.

1313
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:56,270
No, it is not over.

1314
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:58,190
Not yet.

1315
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:12,670
I refuse to die here.

1316
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,710
What the hell?

1317
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:34,510
Oh my God.
We've got to move.

1318
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,390
Come on. We've got
to get out of here.

1319
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:38,550
- Leave me.
- No, you're coming with me.

1320
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:41,790
Oh my God.

1321
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:43,750
We got to get out
of here.

1322
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:46,390
Just go up
as fast as you can.

1323
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:48,630
Faster, faster.
Keep going.

1324
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:51,390
Okay. Good girl.

1325
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:57,390
What the hell?

1326
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,470
Oh my God.

1327
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:03,950
Okay, we've got to get
out of here.

1328
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:12,270
This is insane.

1329
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:19,030
It's Jerry's diagram.

1330
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:27,670
It's all the numbers.

1331
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:39,390
They're all just
suddenly in here.

1332
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:44,110
It's Jerry's markings...

1333
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:49,630
that dead
physicist's equations...

1334
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:53,390
and that
damn colonel's corpse,

1335
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:57,070
just hanging there as if
we never even rescued him?

1336
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:03,510
Everything keeps appearing
over and over again.

1337
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:07,070
Sasha...

1338
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:10,950
please, you have to have
some idea what this means.

1339
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:13,150
All the realities
are starting to collapse

1340
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,150
into one space.

1341
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:19,030
And what happens to us
when they... "it" collapses?

1342
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:21,670
The whole thing implodes.

1343
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:24,790
It's only a matter of time.

1344
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:28,830
I'm not gonna just stand here
while it happens.

1345
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:35,310
I'm not
leaving him behind.

1346
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:37,790
- Oh my God.
- Kate!

1347
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:40,830
- Let me go.
- Get the hell up here!

1348
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:42,790
Oh my God.

1349
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:44,510
Kate.

1350
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:46,470
We don't have
much time.

1351
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:08,390
No.
I refuse to die here.

1352
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:10,350
I wish
I had your spirit.

1353
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:12,270
Hello, gorgeous.
Miss me?

1354
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:13,870
Huh?
Come on in.

1355
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:15,830
The water's fine.

1356
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:17,830
Agh!

1357
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:24,030
Hello, Kate.

1358
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:25,470
Let her go.

1359
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:27,510
Who are you?

1360
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:31,470
Yeah, it's me...

1361
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:35,150
good old Simon.

1362
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:38,430
Do you remember this?
Do you?

1363
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:40,990
I've waited a long time
for pay back.

1364
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:44,190
That was just...
seconds ago.

1365
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:45,950
Don't be so stupid, Kate.

1366
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:49,030
Time works differently
in this place.

1367
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:53,630
Hey, just...
okay.

1368
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:56,310
Just let her go.
She's just a kid.

1369
01:19:56,390 --> 01:20:00,030
She'll be a dead little kid,
unless you come here to papa.

1370
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:01,430
Okay.

1371
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:04,150
Just let her go...

1372
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:06,950
we can figure
something out, okay?

1373
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:10,990
You take her place.

1374
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:15,710
What do you want?

1375
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:18,350
I'm hungry.

1376
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:21,350
- Simon?
- Huh?

1377
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:23,710
There's no point.

1378
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:27,390
We're all dead anyway.

1379
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:29,550
Oh, oh.

1380
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:31,190
Okay.

1381
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:33,710
No!

1382
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:46,470
Oh, come on Kate.

1383
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:50,150
The fun's just beginning.

1384
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:52,310
Oh my God.

1385
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:01,430
What the hell?

1386
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:06,150
- Yah!
- Agh!

1387
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:20,270
I'm really gonna miss you.

1388
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:36,550
Jesus...

1389
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:43,190
Of course,

1390
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:45,870
6-0-6-5-9.

1391
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:47,910
It's an expiration date.

1392
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:50,670
He figured out
when it's gonna implode.

1393
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:23,190
Leave me.

1394
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:35,670
Hello, Kate.
Welcome back.

1395
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:40,310
So, you figured it out.

1396
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:42,590
Yes, sir.

1397
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:44,430
No time to spare.

1398
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:48,670
The device...
any luck?

1399
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:11,310
We'll take that to Darcy and see
if anything recorded on it.

1400
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:38,630
Sir?

1401
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:40,310
Yes, sir.

1402
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:42,590
Phase two is terminated.

1403
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:47,390
I see.

1404
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:50,430
Yes, sir.

1405
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:52,110
Right away, sir.
