1
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:12,361
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

2
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:18,463
<i>Do you believe in sin?</i>

3
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:23,537
<i>There's nothing to believe.</i>

4
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:39,086
"The battle against the Devil, which is the principal task
of Saint Michael the Archangel, is still being fought today,
because the Devil is still alive and active in the world."
Pope John Paul II

5
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:46,188
What follows is inspired by true events.

6
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,188
- You finished?
- Yep.

7
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,819
Then wash up and come eat.

8
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:31,756
I've washed up.

9
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:36,588
Well, then eat.

10
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:42,664
And when you're done,
I'll need a hand with the casket.

11
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,111
How'd she do it?

12
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,277
What?

13
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:57,380
Kill herself.

14
00:03:57,553 --> 00:03:59,885
Michael, I've told you this many times.

15
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:02,854
We serve the dead,
but we don't talk about them.

16
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,320
It brings bad things.

17
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,226
We keep dead people in the house, Dad.

18
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:11,594
How much worse could it get?

19
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:05,318
- Are you kidding me?
- No, Eddie. I'm not kidding.

20
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:06,546
Wait, why?

21
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:08,824
So I can get out of here.

22
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:13,190
Why not tell him you wanna go to college?
I mean, you got the grades. You can do it.

23
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:16,958
- You think he'd pay for that?
- Shit, man. Seminary school?

24
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,727
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
Seminary school, really?

25
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,267
Wait, is this your way of telling me
you're gay? I'm just joking. Okay? Joking.

26
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,433
Man, you don't get it. In my family, you're
either a mortician or a priest. That's it.

27
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,704
Well, then change your name.

28
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,441
It's too late. I took the entrance exam.

29
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:36,175
- You what?
- I passed.

30
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,751
I'm leaving Monday.

31
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,391
That's... That's crazy.

32
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:43,923
Dude, I've looked into it.

33
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,618
It's a four-year degree
before you even take your first vows.

34
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:49,026
If it doesn't work out, I can always leave.

35
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:52,926
Wow. Such faith.

36
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:55,600
You know what, Eddie?
You're such a dick.

37
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,740
Cool. Awesome. Whatever, dude.

38
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:01,365
I will never confess to you.
You know that, right?

39
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:02,704
These are on the house.

40
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,938
- Wow.
- Gonna get heat for giving away beers?

41
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,513
Not if they don't know.

42
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:08,445
How about for banging the customers?

43
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:10,442
Screw you, Eddie.

44
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,286
Drink up. I'm off in 10.

45
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,287
Lickety-split.

46
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:20,688
"Lickety-split"? Pbbb.

47
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:24,924
You better make the most of that
before they chop your wiener off.

48
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:28,767
Goodbye, wiener.

49
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:08,633
Don't worry.

50
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,740
The pain is gone.

51
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:15,645
God has taken it...

52
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,914
...away.

53
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:25,123
Michael. Come.

54
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,260
Don't be afraid.

55
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:54,880
Four years later.

56
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,685
<i>This is always a special Mass for me...</i>

57
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,488
<i>... as I look upon our new deacons...</i>

58
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:05,123
<i>... as they prepare to go into the world
with Christ's message.</i>

59
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:09,004
So in the next few months,
you will face your last assessments...

60
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:13,131
...and then be asked to take
your final vows to become priests.

61
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:18,406
So I leave you with these words to
consider, from the Gospel of Saint John:

62
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:22,283
You did not choose me...

63
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:25,151
...it was I who chose you...

64
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:31,088
...and I send you forth
to bear fruit that will last.

65
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,608
Michael.

66
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,117
Exam results.

67
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,515
You aced psychology.

68
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:03,323
- Art history too. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

69
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:06,425
So, what happened with theology?

70
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,794
It's like you blew it on purpose.

71
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,661
I've been distracted.
End of the year, that's all.

72
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:14,865
Drop by my office this week.
We'll discuss it.

73
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:16,796
Okay.

74
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,608
Yeah, jump. Take him out.

75
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,918
Dude, honestly?

76
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:24,599
Michael!

77
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:25,798
Michael, wait!

78
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:48,821
Call an ambulance!

79
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:07,646
Bless me, Father.

80
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:12,616
Father.

81
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:15,085
Bless me.

82
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:18,923
Please, Father.

83
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:22,057
I don't wanna die like this.

84
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:29,563
Uh, through the power vested in me:

85
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:34,676
Let the fire of the Holy Spirit descend,
that this being may be awakened...

86
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:38,540
...in the world beyond
the life of this earth...

87
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:42,415
...and infused with the power
of the Holy Spirit.

88
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:45,946
Lord Jesus Christ, I ask
that you receive this child...

89
00:11:46,822 --> 00:11:48,551
What's your name?

90
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:52,324
Sandra.

91
00:11:56,599 --> 00:12:00,899
I ask you to receive this child,
Sandra, into your loving arms...

92
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,267
...that she might pass in safety
from this crisis...

93
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,601
...as you have taught us
with infinite passion.

94
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:11,076
By this sign, you are anointed with the grace
of the atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ...

95
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:14,239
...and absolved of all past error
and freed to take your place...

96
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,885
...in the world he has prepared for us.

97
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,021
Amen.

98
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:06,360
Michael.

99
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:10,663
I still don't even understand
how it happened.

100
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:13,738
You shouldn't think about it.

101
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:16,442
It was an accident. Really.

102
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:18,311
It's hard not to think about.

103
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:21,305
I feel somewhat responsible.

104
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:25,244
You know the average age
of a nun these days?

105
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:27,019
Sixty-nine.

106
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,219
Three thousand parishes across the U.S.
Don't even have a priest anymore.

107
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,861
You give this speech
to everyone who tries to leave?

108
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:37,294
No, just those I believe in.

109
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,294
I quit smoking and
now I'm addicted to these.

110
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,282
You know, what I saw the other night,
it was really something.

111
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:58,147
I know experienced priests
who wouldn't have handled that.

112
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,949
I just repeated a few prayers
over a suffering girl.

113
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:03,818
And the words meant nothing to you?

114
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:07,394
Father, listen to me,
did you understand my letter?

115
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,894
Yes, I decided not to
pass it on to my superiors.

116
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,593
- Why not?
- I think you're making a mistake.

117
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:21,201
I think this is the part where I say, "It's
not you, it's me" and "Let's just be friends."

118
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,669
Here's the thing.

119
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:26,738
Tastes like shit.

120
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,578
If a seminarian doesn't complete his vows,
then under Article 15...

121
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:37,124
...the Church has the right to convert
the scholarship to a student loan.

122
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,887
That's over 100 grand of education
you'd owe us.

123
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:43,395
Why would you do that?

124
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:46,228
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not saying I'm going to do it...

125
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:48,302
...just yet.

126
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:54,133
You were a mortician
before you joined us, am I right?

127
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:56,841
I imagine that means
you're not very squeamish.

128
00:14:57,012 --> 00:14:58,036
What is this about?

129
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:06,752
Last year, the Vatican received over a half
a million reports of demonic possession.

130
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:09,482
- That's something of a record.
- I'm still not following.

131
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,182
An order has been passed down...

132
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,230
...to place an exorcist in every diocese
across the U.S. By this time next year.

133
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,200
As you might imagine, it's not
a highly sought-after position.

134
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:24,705
There's a new program at the Vatican...

135
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:28,639
...designed to reteach the clergy
the rite of exorcism.

136
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:32,209
I've been asked to keep an eye out
for potential candidates.

137
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:34,747
<i>Wait a minute, you...</i>

138
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:39,017
You want me to be an exorcist?

139
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,452
Why?

140
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,559
Why would you want me?

141
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:46,251
I don't know what I believe in.

142
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:48,157
That's right.

143
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,797
I remember in your letter...

144
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:53,992
...you explained how you used
the priesthood to run away from things.

145
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:57,434
The truth is, you could have run
in any direction, but you ran here.

146
00:15:58,173 --> 00:15:59,800
Why?

147
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,538
Just take the course.

148
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:06,978
And then if you still wanna leave when
you get back, we can talk about it then.

149
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:12,654
Two months in Rome.
How bad could that be?

150
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,080
Keep the change. Thank you.

151
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,320
I'm guessing there's no cable.

152
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:34,188
<i>By the time an exorcist is called
to assess a possible possession...</i>

153
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,026
<i>... the parish priest would have ensured...</i>

154
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,601
<i>... that all psychiatric explanations
had been exhausted.</i>

155
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,137
<i>He would have questioned
the possessed himself...</i>

156
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:48,765
<i>... and forwarded his assessment
on to his bishop.</i>

157
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:51,435
<i>With the bishop's permission...</i>

158
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:56,073
<i>... an exorcist is then summoned
to determine possession.</i>

159
00:18:56,251 --> 00:19:01,154
Often, early signs of a possession
are subtle.

160
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,421
Social withdrawal...

161
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:05,389
...apathy...

162
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:10,454
...a persistent tremor in a limb.

163
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,463
It can go unnoticed
until the victim is deep within...

164
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:16,627
...the demonic spirit's grasp.

165
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:20,468
This was taken at an exorcism in Turin.

166
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:28,975
The woman survived without food or water
for eight weeks...

167
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:31,852
...before the demon released her.

168
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:38,626
This man's jaw spontaneously dislocated
while being read the Lord's Prayer.

169
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:42,025
He made no physical contact
with any object...

170
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:45,598
...nor was he met with
any physical force.

171
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:52,637
Demons are the devil's foot soldiers...

172
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:56,175
...often operating in groups
much like a squadron...

173
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:57,744
...infesting their victims.

174
00:19:57,913 --> 00:20:00,575
It is the job of an exorcist...

175
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:04,446
...to determine the number of
possessing demons and their names...

176
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:08,384
...something the demons protect
with great ferocity.

177
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,421
And when the exorcist has a name...

178
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:14,858
...he can then begin to
assert control over the entity...

179
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,998
...and cast it out.

180
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:20,159
Who have we here?

181
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,773
- Michael Kovak.
- I'm sorry?

182
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,276
Michael Kovak.

183
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,138
Oh, yes.

184
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,609
The American.

185
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:36,475
- Yeah. Sorry I'm late.
- Yes, I prefer punctuality to apologies.

186
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:38,819
Welcome. Sit down.

187
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:47,689
Die, priest, die!

188
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:54,695
The most identifiable sign
of a possession...

189
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,863
...is the negative reaction
to sacred objects.

190
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:03,207
Crucifixes, holy water.

191
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:05,672
The man that you have just heard...

192
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,248
...was reacting to a crucifix
placed on his head.

193
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:11,147
- Excuse me, Father.
- Yes?

194
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,221
What if he was suffering from
the delusion that he's possessed?

195
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:16,788
Wouldn't he react in the same way?

196
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:22,056
Admittedly, it's very easy to
confuse psychotic illness with possession.

197
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,996
It's up to the exorcist
to discern the difference.

198
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,465
So how do you do that?

199
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,264
Well, there are many ways.

200
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:34,603
For example, paranoid schizophrenics
are not aware that they're deluded.

201
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:38,177
Neither are the possessed while
they're being possessed, are they?

202
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:41,748
But people who are possessed
have periods of lucidity. That's my point.

203
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:43,316
So do schizophrenics.

204
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:47,615
One can't suddenly manifest
abilities simply because one is deluded.

205
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:51,418
The man on this tape is German.

206
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,925
How does he spontaneously
speak Russian?

207
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:57,925
How could a boy in a village in Africa
found 400 miles from his home...

208
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,534
...claim that he was abducted by aliens?

209
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:01,930
It's just as unlikely.

210
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:05,039
But we're willing to call him crazy
and your German man not...

211
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:08,074
...because he believes in aliens,
not God.

212
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:15,307
We're not here
to scrutinize religion with science.

213
00:22:16,018 --> 00:22:22,116
The object of this course is to view
phenomena through the lens of faith.

214
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,350
So which do you believe in,
aliens or God?

215
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:27,722
The jury's out on both.

216
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:29,921
Interesting perspective for a priest.

217
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,861
I'm not a priest...

218
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,661
...yet.

219
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:35,962
So you're having a final fling
with atheism?

220
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:39,733
Well, I guess it's more like an ex-girlfriend
who keeps coming around.

221
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:42,241
Angelina.

222
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:45,278
We are going to the library..
Are you joining us?

223
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,826
Thank you, gentlemen. See you at Mass.

224
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:09,869
Michael. Walk with me a moment.

225
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:13,197
I understand you were taught
by Father Matthew.

226
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,865
That's right.

227
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:17,876
He's a dear friend.
We studied together at Loyola.

228
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:21,777
He's asked me to keep an eye on you.
He thinks you've got great potential.

229
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,577
That's a lot of pressure.

230
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:25,845
For both of us.

231
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,384
What do you think of the course so far?

232
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,787
To be honest, I don't know
what to make of it.

233
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:32,586
I suspected as much.

234
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:36,754
Tell me, Michael, do you believe in sin?

235
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:40,299
Yeah, I just don't necessarily believe
the devil makes us do it.

236
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:43,169
He that committeth sin is of the devil.

237
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:46,237
Then that'd be all of us, wouldn't it?

238
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:48,740
And if we're all of the devil,
how do we fight him?

239
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:54,877
Tomorrow, I recommend you take
your doubts for a walk around Rome.

240
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,744
You can pay a visit
to an old friend of mine.

241
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:00,588
Father Lucas?

242
00:24:00,755 --> 00:24:02,916
He's Welsh. Jesuit.

243
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:05,787
His methods are a little less orthodox.

244
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:08,088
Studied under
Father Carmine De Filippis.

245
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:11,460
- I don't know what that means.
- It means he knows his stuff.

246
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,567
He'll be happy to provide you with
the kind of proof you seem to need.

247
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:19,502
Excuse me, I have a Mass to say.

248
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jesus.

249
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:54,163
- Father Lucas?
- Yes?

250
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:56,798
Hi. I'm Michael Kovak.

251
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,635
- Oh. You're the American.
- Yeah.

252
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:03,408
- You don't like cats?
- Not particularly.

253
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:06,547
Welcome to Rome.
It's infested with cats.

254
00:26:06,715 --> 00:26:08,910
I've tried giving them names
but it's pointless.

255
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:12,884
A cat won't come no matter what
you call it. They do as they please.

256
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:16,224
Anyway, welcome.

257
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:21,928
Make sure they don't come in.

258
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:25,123
No. Hey, hey.

259
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:30,571
Father Xavier tells me you're troubled.

260
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:33,230
I don't think Father Xavier
explained the situation.

261
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:35,569
He explained it well enough.

262
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:37,473
I've arranged for you to meet someone.

263
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,340
Speak of the devil.

264
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:56,956
God bless you, Father,
thank you for seeing us.

265
00:26:57,132 --> 00:26:59,760
There's no need to thank me.

266
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:04,928
Put it in the kitchen.

267
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:09,766
Sit down.

268
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:15,374
Have you fed them?

269
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,950
No, they don't need feeding.

270
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:23,354
Lucia. Gabriella. Dante. Federico.

271
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:31,957
Where's Hermione?

272
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,865
Come now.

273
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:35,400
No. I want to see Hermione.

274
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,629
After. Come.

275
00:27:52,153 --> 00:27:55,953
If you wanna watch, you have
to help me. I'll need to absolve you first.

276
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:57,523
Help with what?

277
00:27:57,692 --> 00:27:59,819
The exorcism. What do you think?

278
00:27:59,994 --> 00:28:02,690
Or you can stay down here
with her aunt.

279
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,822
That could be fun.

280
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:06,796
It's up to you.

281
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:11,004
Whatever you do, don't address the girl
directly, no matter what she says.

282
00:28:11,172 --> 00:28:13,231
And if I ask you to hold her down...

283
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:17,105
...it's best you grab her arms
from behind...

284
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,610
...and try keeping her
in a seated position.

285
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,249
The spirit is pretty devious.
Hasn't shown itself yet.

286
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:24,578
- The spirit?
- Yes. Spirit.

287
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:28,853
Demon. The devil.

288
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:32,186
If it hasn't shown itself,
how do you know she's possessed?

289
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:34,828
All right, give me something,
anything that's yours.

290
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:38,662
Put it in this.

291
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:40,227
What is it, a dollar bill?

292
00:28:40,402 --> 00:28:42,563
Come on, do it. Quickly.
It's for your benefit.

293
00:28:43,738 --> 00:28:45,433
What else?

294
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:48,606
Oh, yes. It's Michael, isn't it?

295
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,341
I absolve you of any sins you may
have committed now or in the past...

296
00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:54,812
...in the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.

297
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,747
- Amen.
- All right, come on.

298
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:03,389
Oh, yes, one other thing. If it does manifest,
don't even look into the girl's eyes.

299
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:06,823
Whatever you do, do not address it.
Do not speak to it. It's the devil.

300
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,054
- Leave that to me. Do you understand?
- Cool.

301
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,857
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, I get it.

302
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:12,590
Well, just say so.

303
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:15,258
Bow your head, keep praying
and good luck.

304
00:29:48,837 --> 00:29:50,566
How are you?

305
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:52,497
The same.

306
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:54,742
Have you eaten?

307
00:29:57,979 --> 00:30:00,311
What about your baby?

308
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:03,747
You need to eat.

309
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:06,514
Okay.

310
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,183
<i>Um...</i>

311
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:13,458
What's happened since Tuesday?

312
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:17,696
It won't stop now.
Even when I sleep it talks.

313
00:30:22,003 --> 00:30:23,698
Okay.

314
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:26,736
Now she's gonna guess what's in the bag.

315
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,168
Rosaria?

316
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:31,472
See the bag?

317
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:36,044
Tell me what's in it.

318
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:38,818
How could I know that?

319
00:30:38,987 --> 00:30:41,080
Then I want you to guess.

320
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,049
I don't know.

321
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:47,217
Clear your mind and guess.

322
00:30:47,395 --> 00:30:49,863
It's not a test. Just guess.

323
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:51,157
I don't want to.

324
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:53,232
I'm ordering you to guess! Guess!

325
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:10,446
Show her.

326
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:22,325
There you are.

327
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:24,624
Knowledge of the unknowable.

328
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:26,864
It's the quickest test for possession.

329
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:30,198
The devil is working in and through her
right now.

330
00:31:32,006 --> 00:31:33,439
Okay.

331
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:40,571
<i>Uh...</i>

332
00:31:40,748 --> 00:31:43,239
Did it tell you what was in the bag?

333
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:46,448
Is it talking now?

334
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:48,316
What's it saying?

335
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,725
Disgusting things.

336
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:56,227
It's important you tell me.

337
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:11,371
Has it told you its name yet?

338
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,308
Do you know its name?

339
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:16,643
Tell me its name.

340
00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:18,342
Tell me now.

341
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,827
In!

342
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,730
I can't talk now,
I'm in the middle of something.

343
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,148
Shut up, shut up.

344
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:28,648
Shut up, priest.

345
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,415
You must not touch me.

346
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:33,123
You are disgusting.

347
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:35,021
Keep your dirty hands off me.

348
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:37,130
Shut up! You must not speak.

349
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:38,663
Don't touch me!

350
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,491
Go away, priest. Go away!

351
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:42,966
You stink, you are disgusting.

352
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:10,724
Rosaria.

353
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,093
Rosaria.

354
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:16,193
Open your mouth.

355
00:34:19,006 --> 00:34:20,200
How do you feel?

356
00:34:27,782 --> 00:34:29,215
Okay.

357
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:39,560
Okay, that's it.

358
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,238
Really? That's it?

359
00:34:51,405 --> 00:34:54,135
Well, what'd you expect?
Spinning heads, pea soup?

360
00:34:58,312 --> 00:35:01,008
Spiritual liberation can take months,
sometimes years.

361
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,746
So she's still possessed?

362
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:05,044
Yeah.

363
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:07,881
<i>I know you don't believe me, but...</i>

364
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:10,781
Tell me...

365
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:16,462
...does a thief or a burglar turn on the
lights when he's robbing your house? No.

366
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:20,863
He prefers you to believe
that he's not there.

367
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,027
Like the devil. He prefers you
to believe that he doesn't exist.

368
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:29,939
It gets complicated when no proof of
the devil is somehow proof of the devil.

369
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:32,504
Yeah.

370
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:44,922
The interesting thing
about skeptics, atheists...

371
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:50,086
...is that we're always looking
for proof, certainty.

372
00:35:50,264 --> 00:35:53,324
The question is, what on earth
would we do if we found it?

373
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:55,128
- "We"?
- Oh, yes.

374
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:58,864
There are times when I experience
a total loss of faith.

375
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,702
Days, months when I don't know
what the hell I believe in.

376
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:05,209
God or the devil,
Santa Claus or Tinker Bell.

377
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:07,276
But...

378
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:10,677
...you know, I'm just a man.

379
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:13,218
I'm a weak man. I have...

380
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:16,422
...no power.

381
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:22,629
Yet there's something that keeps
digging and scraping away inside me.

382
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:26,190
Feels like God's fingernail.

383
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,563
And finally I can take
no more of the pain...

384
00:36:29,737 --> 00:36:34,140
...and I get shoved out
from the darkness...

385
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:36,401
...back into the light.

386
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:39,940
Something like that.

387
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,188
Anyway, enough philosophizing
for one day.

388
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:52,816
If you have any more questions,
you know where to find me.

389
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:57,960
I got my eye on you. What you doing?

390
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:52,317
You're in Rome and you go to McDonald's?

391
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:53,510
Oh, hey.

392
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:57,582
Come on. Let me buy you
an Italian coffee.

393
00:38:01,629 --> 00:38:04,723
Where were you today?
Xavier kicked you out, didn't he?

394
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:07,993
Yeah, I've plea-bargained down
from being burned at the stake.

395
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,796
So you're just vacationing now
on the Church's dime?

396
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:13,133
Yeah, and yours.

397
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:17,341
Seriously, why are you taking the course?

398
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:20,002
Why are you?
Are they recruiting nuns for exorcists?

399
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:22,843
"Nuns"?

400
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:27,420
<i>I'm sorry, I just naturally assumed...</i>

401
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:29,818
Yeah, naturally.

402
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:35,455
Well, if you're not a nun,
why are you taking the course?

403
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:40,723
I'm a journalist. I'm covering
the course for an article.

404
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,870
I see. And I thought
you were just buying me a coffee.

405
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:48,174
There's a lot of interest in this.
A lot of debate.

406
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:52,536
Look...

407
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,273
...I know you saw Father Lucas today.

408
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,613
I've been trying to get an interview
with him, but he's been reluctant.

409
00:38:59,787 --> 00:39:01,652
What is it you want?

410
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,884
- I'd love to know what you saw.
- You're asking me to spy?

411
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:07,823
No, I'm asking you to report
your own experiences.

412
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,294
Listen...

413
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:13,862
...I'm just interested in the truth.

414
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:16,736
Seems like you are too.

415
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:23,839
Just as there is a hierarchy
of angels, ranked in ascendant order...

416
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:27,447
...so, too, is the realm of evil ranked.

417
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,776
And just as each angel has a name...

418
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,145
...so, too, does every demon.

419
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:35,948
Beelzebub, Leviathan, Ba'al.

420
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,353
These are some of the names
we look for...

421
00:39:38,926 --> 00:39:41,451
...when performing an exorcism.

422
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,766
Just bear with me for a moment.

423
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:56,402
Well, I think we should leave it there
and pick it up tomorrow. Thank you.

424
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:06,042
Michael, how's my old friend Lucas?

425
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,154
He's unorthodox.

426
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,153
No exorcism is orthodox.

427
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,452
He's treating a pregnant girl
that I believe needs psychiatric care.

428
00:40:13,627 --> 00:40:14,855
You believe?

429
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:17,327
Father Lucas has been doing this
longer than anyone I know.

430
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,329
I'm telling you because I'm concerned.

431
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,694
It's not uncommon...

432
00:40:20,868 --> 00:40:23,928
...to be overly concerned for the subject
in one's first exorcism.

433
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:27,563
You have to see that
it is the demon that's in pain.

434
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:30,743
Trust me. Father Lucas gets results.

435
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:32,242
At what cost?

436
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:24,121
Oh. What can I do for you?

437
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:26,990
Rosaria.

438
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:28,863
You remember this man?

439
00:41:29,036 --> 00:41:31,368
He was sent by the Vatican.

440
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:35,342
I want you to answer his questions.

441
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:38,106
Hi.

442
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:42,841
It was terrible to see you
go through your suffering.

443
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:47,144
This is unimportant. Just nod.

444
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:49,221
Do you remember any of it?

445
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:53,557
He wants to know if you remember things
when the devil takes over your body.

446
00:42:01,802 --> 00:42:06,671
She says it's like a dream or a nightmare.

447
00:42:24,091 --> 00:42:25,490
This is yours, yes?

448
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:31,424
Do you know how it got in my pocket?

449
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,829
Did you put it in his pocket?

450
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:35,697
Tell the truth now.

451
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,428
It wasn't me.

452
00:42:37,605 --> 00:42:39,300
Then who was it?

453
00:42:40,274 --> 00:42:42,640
Rosaria, who was it?

454
00:42:48,515 --> 00:42:49,812
The devil?

455
00:42:50,084 --> 00:42:51,551
Why would she lie?

456
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:54,620
- She's 16.
- Yes.

457
00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:56,517
And she's pregnant.

458
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,248
Who's the father of her child?

459
00:42:58,425 --> 00:42:59,949
She won't say.

460
00:43:00,761 --> 00:43:02,956
Ask her who gave her
the bracelet, please.

461
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:10,797
- Her father.
- And where is he now?

462
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:13,201
- He's gone away. He left the family.
- When?

463
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:16,502
Oh, I don't know.
A few months ago, I believe.

464
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:22,839
- What are you doing?
- I'm giving it back to her.

465
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:13,594
Remember the fat little bitch?

466
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,897
Killed herself.

467
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,801
She says to say hello.

468
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:22,738
Hell-o.

469
00:44:24,144 --> 00:44:26,078
In the name of Jesus Christ,
name yourself.

470
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,376
In the name of Jesus Christ,
name yourself.

471
00:44:30,851 --> 00:44:34,184
By the authority of Jesus Christ,
I command you to declare yourself!

472
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:38,716
By the authority of Jesus Christ,
I command you to declare yourself now!

473
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:41,425
We are the fruit of her womb.

474
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,825
Speak the truth, in the name
of Jesus Christ.

475
00:44:43,997 --> 00:44:46,056
Speak the truth, in the name
of Jesus Christ.

476
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:48,701
We're strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

477
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:54,672
In the name of Judas Cross.

478
00:44:54,842 --> 00:44:58,437
Demon, name yourself.
Your name, demon! Your name!

479
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,204
Tremble before the Lord!

480
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:03,179
We're strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

481
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:04,374
Now!

482
00:45:05,686 --> 00:45:08,382
By the authority of Jesus Christ,
I command you to...

483
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:09,715
Hold her!

484
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:10,948
Help me. Help me.

485
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,422
Hail Mary, full of grace.

486
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:14,993
<i>The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women...</i>

487
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:27,769
Shit on your Holy Spirit!

488
00:45:30,944 --> 00:45:32,707
He that dwelleth
in the secret place of the Most High...

489
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,906
...shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty. He is my refuge...

490
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:37,812
...my fortress and my strength.

491
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,385
<i>He shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler...</i>

492
00:45:40,554 --> 00:45:42,283
Rape me.

493
00:45:46,193 --> 00:45:48,286
My fortress and my strength.

494
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:50,352
Lickety-split.

495
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:56,798
Thou shalt not be afraid for
the terror by night, nor for the arrow...

496
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,962
...nor for the destruction that wasteth.
A thousand shall fall...

497
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,767
<i>...and 10,000 at thy right hand...</i>

498
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:04,410
Father, please.

499
00:46:04,578 --> 00:46:07,046
Don't let it hurt my baby.

500
00:46:07,247 --> 00:46:10,375
They shall bear thee up in their hands,
lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

501
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,881
Take it out!

502
00:46:16,123 --> 00:46:18,956
Shit it out and eat it!

503
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:29,099
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

504
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:32,170
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

505
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:36,776
<i>Give us this day our daily bread and forgive
us our trespasses, as we forgive those...</i>

506
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Help me.
<i>You...</i>
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

507
00:46:47,087 --> 00:46:49,055
Go to hell, priest!

508
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,088
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

509
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:53,818
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

510
00:46:53,994 --> 00:46:56,861
...now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

511
00:46:57,631 --> 00:46:59,997
- Hail Mary, full of grace.
- She's choking. Father.

512
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:02,863
Pray with me! Out!

513
00:47:03,036 --> 00:47:07,268
And begone, you unclean spirits
of terror and darkness. Out!

514
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:10,634
Damned Legion, Satan, Lucifer, out!

515
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:13,006
Begone! We banish you,
we cast you out...

516
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:17,378
...in the name of the Virgin Mary, mother
of Christ, the son of the living God...

517
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:19,815
...in whom we live, and move,
and have our being.

518
00:47:19,987 --> 00:47:21,887
Who lives in us and reigns in us
supreme.

519
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:24,649
We cast you out from
the nothingness and the darkness...

520
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:28,727
...from whence you came.
Out, demon! Out, Lucifer! Out, Satan!

521
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:31,262
Now! Begone! In the name
of the Holy Spirit.

522
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:41,097
Deliver this from the snare
of the fowler, from the pestilence...

523
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,902
...from the darkness.

524
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,154
Well, she's asleep.

525
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,931
She needs to rest.

526
00:48:05,098 --> 00:48:09,899
So I'll send her home in a few days
so she can recover.

527
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,600
I thought you were required
to have a doctor present.

528
00:48:16,777 --> 00:48:18,608
I am a doctor.

529
00:48:21,081 --> 00:48:22,878
Has she seen a psychiatrist?

530
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,917
- Yeah.
- What happened?

531
00:48:26,086 --> 00:48:28,054
Oh, she doesn't respond to treatment.

532
00:48:28,221 --> 00:48:31,520
- Is she on antidepressants?
- No.

533
00:48:31,925 --> 00:48:35,554
- No, she's pregnant.
- So she hasn't been medically treated?

534
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:38,755
Yeah. I'm looking after her.

535
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:43,600
Weren't you concerned for her health
up there?

536
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:45,738
Yeah, of course I was.

537
00:48:45,906 --> 00:48:47,771
Well, how will her baby survive this?

538
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:53,573
See, it's very difficult to predict how
any of this stuff is gonna work out.

539
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,882
- Have you ever lost a patient?
- Yeah.

540
00:48:59,586 --> 00:49:03,613
Yeah, a boy I once treated.
He was about 15 years of age...

541
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:07,449
...and he committed suicide...

542
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:10,195
...and I was depressed
for a few months...

543
00:49:11,098 --> 00:49:14,499
...and I started to doubt everything
I believed in.

544
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:19,197
And I thought the devil had defeated me.

545
00:49:22,342 --> 00:49:25,334
Don't you think she should
see a psychiatrist again?

546
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,512
You're still not convinced...

547
00:49:29,683 --> 00:49:33,779
Oh, Christ! She was raped by her father.
She's internalizing her guilt.

548
00:49:35,355 --> 00:49:38,916
"Internalizing"? Okay.

549
00:49:39,593 --> 00:49:41,493
Still doesn't explain everything,
does it?

550
00:49:41,662 --> 00:49:44,358
It doesn't explain
how she started to speak English.

551
00:49:44,531 --> 00:49:48,194
Well, she's a teenager. She's listened
to a thousand songs on the radio.

552
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,904
What about these nails?

553
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:54,664
It could be that she swallowed them
to hurt the baby.

554
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:56,172
She clearly doesn't want it.

555
00:49:58,378 --> 00:50:03,213
What about the voice inside her? That
wasn't a human voice, though, was it?

556
00:50:04,851 --> 00:50:06,614
You be careful, Michael.

557
00:50:06,787 --> 00:50:08,118
Why?

558
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:12,621
Choosing not to believe in the devil
won't protect you from him.

559
00:50:23,904 --> 00:50:25,929
<i>Michael.</i>

560
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:29,165
Come.

561
00:50:43,423 --> 00:50:45,721
<i>Come closer.</i>

562
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:53,497
You're not a coward. Don't be afraid.

563
00:50:54,901 --> 00:50:57,028
It's just your mother.

564
00:50:57,504 --> 00:50:58,903
Now...

565
00:50:59,506 --> 00:51:01,599
...blow.

566
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:05,367
We want to do a good job, don't we?

567
00:51:06,279 --> 00:51:08,713
The best we can.

568
00:51:10,884 --> 00:51:13,375
Good. Now...

569
00:51:16,389 --> 00:51:18,220
...pray.

570
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:26,221
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

571
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:29,596
<i>Blessed art thou among women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb...</i>

572
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,897
My love.

573
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,572
My flower.

574
00:51:34,741 --> 00:51:37,642
<i>Mother of God, pray for us sinners...</i>

575
00:51:38,645 --> 00:51:40,875
My beautiful.

576
00:51:41,047 --> 00:51:43,277
Amen.

577
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:11,672
Can't get enough, huh?

578
00:52:11,845 --> 00:52:15,781
Doing house calls today.
Take that, it's gonna rain.

579
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,345
Shut the gate after you.

580
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,393
<i>Vincenzo.</i>

581
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:34,091
<i>What happens in your dream?</i>

582
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:36,662
<i>I'm being hurt.</i>

583
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,495
<i>By what?</i>

584
00:52:38,805 --> 00:52:40,739
<i>A mule.</i>

585
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,068
<i>With red eyes.</i>

586
00:52:45,545 --> 00:52:47,172
It kicks me.

587
00:52:47,347 --> 00:52:49,076
And bites me.

588
00:52:51,484 --> 00:52:53,543
And do you try and run away?

589
00:52:56,056 --> 00:52:57,819
Why not?

590
00:52:58,158 --> 00:53:02,492
Because he says he's my father
and I must obey him.

591
00:53:02,662 --> 00:53:04,425
Oh.

592
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,764
What else does he tell you?

593
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,631
He tells me...

594
00:53:17,043 --> 00:53:19,011
...to kill myself.

595
00:53:20,714 --> 00:53:22,614
Show him.

596
00:53:27,687 --> 00:53:30,178
He woke up with these.

597
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,269
The mule from the dream?

598
00:53:50,043 --> 00:53:51,476
Vincenzo?

599
00:53:52,612 --> 00:53:55,775
The mule in the dream?

600
00:53:57,117 --> 00:53:58,880
Mama?

601
00:54:01,755 --> 00:54:03,655
Not Mama?

602
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,025
You hit him?

603
00:54:09,596 --> 00:54:10,858
Are you lying?

604
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:12,692
Are you a liar?

605
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,636
Okay.

606
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:25,742
Come here.

607
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:31,208
Open your mouth.

608
00:54:31,384 --> 00:54:33,215
Ahh.

609
00:54:35,088 --> 00:54:37,886
Bring me his pillow.

610
00:55:05,652 --> 00:55:08,052
Banish all the forces of evil
from this pillow.

611
00:55:08,521 --> 00:55:11,354
Vanquish them. Destroy them!

612
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:14,252
Now!

613
00:55:18,598 --> 00:55:19,622
Ah.

614
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:31,033
The devil!

615
00:55:42,555 --> 00:55:47,254
We cast you out, every unclean spirit...

616
00:55:47,794 --> 00:55:50,262
...every Satanic power...

617
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:54,422
...every onslaught of
the infernal adversary.

618
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,468
Be gone and stay far
from this creature of God...

619
00:55:57,637 --> 00:56:01,095
<i>...for it is he who commands you,
it is he...</i>

620
00:56:06,012 --> 00:56:07,707
He who would still the sea...

621
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:09,781
...the wind and the storm.

622
00:56:12,252 --> 00:56:15,688
Flee, enemy of the faith,
you foe of the human race.

623
00:56:15,855 --> 00:56:21,191
That's enough now, do you hear me?
No one is going to die.

624
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:24,819
Put the unholy tempter to flight.

625
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,958
And of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

626
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,889
I'm supposed to take care
of this place...

627
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:59,359
...but I feel so bad.
Never seem to have any time.

628
00:56:59,532 --> 00:57:02,160
You ever wonder if the people
you help are just mistaken?

629
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,632
Yeah. Sometimes, I suppose.

630
00:57:04,604 --> 00:57:06,799
But you still do what you do.

631
00:57:06,973 --> 00:57:09,635
Why not? I haven't seen a prayer
hurt anyone yet.

632
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:13,472
So you're happy to have them continue
believing something that may not be true?

633
00:57:13,646 --> 00:57:15,477
Yes, why not?

634
00:57:15,815 --> 00:57:18,511
And what is it you believe?

635
00:57:19,085 --> 00:57:22,316
I believe that people prefer to lie
to themselves than face the truth.

636
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:27,157
The truth, yeah. Certainty.

637
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:20,074
I will leave immediately.

638
00:58:20,313 --> 00:58:22,474
I understand. Thank you.

639
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,721
Rosaria just tried to drown herself.

640
00:58:35,828 --> 00:58:39,320
We gave her pethidine
and trazodone but she won't calm down.

641
00:58:39,499 --> 00:58:41,899
Legally we can't give her anything else.

642
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,842
Look what I've done to her, priest!

643
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:53,478
And I'm not finished yet!

644
00:59:25,378 --> 00:59:26,709
Leave it.

645
00:59:27,413 --> 00:59:30,007
Let her see who is in command.

646
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:34,179
Demon. Deceiver.

647
00:59:36,055 --> 00:59:37,750
Speak your name.

648
00:59:37,924 --> 00:59:39,892
Never.

649
00:59:41,294 --> 00:59:42,955
Why are you living in her?

650
00:59:43,129 --> 00:59:47,225
Because her suffering is sweet.

651
00:59:48,101 --> 00:59:49,625
What do you plan to do with her?

652
00:59:49,802 --> 00:59:52,737
Eat the flies from her rotting flesh.

653
00:59:54,073 --> 00:59:55,631
How did you enter her?

654
00:59:55,808 --> 00:59:57,742
With her father's seed.

655
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:01,812
- So you remember being raped?
- Don't address it directly.

656
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:07,647
When the devil has nothing
better to do, he rapes his children.

657
01:00:08,621 --> 01:00:09,645
I don't understand.

658
01:00:16,162 --> 01:00:18,323
You know how to swear
in every language?

659
01:00:18,498 --> 01:00:22,400
Therefore let us
go down and confound their tongue...

660
01:00:22,568 --> 01:00:25,128
...that they may not understand
one another's speech.

661
01:00:26,105 --> 01:00:27,936
You know the Bible well.

662
01:00:28,107 --> 01:00:30,769
We know it very well.

663
01:00:35,682 --> 01:00:36,842
Very clever.

664
01:00:37,016 --> 01:00:38,881
Don't patronize me, doubter!

665
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:42,379
It is I who chose you.

666
01:00:42,955 --> 01:00:45,515
- Why do you call me "doubter"?
- Because it's true.

667
01:00:46,426 --> 01:00:48,894
A liar knows a liar.

668
01:00:51,531 --> 01:00:53,829
Are you a liar, Rosaria?

669
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,161
What is it you want me to believe?

670
01:00:56,336 --> 01:00:58,031
There's nothing to believe.

671
01:00:59,205 --> 01:01:01,400
Then there is no devil
and you're not possessed?

672
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:04,802
You fear me, mortal!

673
01:01:06,612 --> 01:01:09,172
How can I fear you if you don't exist?

674
01:01:31,671 --> 01:01:33,730
You think you outsmarted him?

675
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,068
That's not the devil.

676
01:01:37,543 --> 01:01:40,068
It's just a very, very sick girl.

677
01:01:41,147 --> 01:01:43,980
She doesn't need a priest,
she needs a shrink.

678
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:50,016
He still has you fooled, hasn't he?

679
01:01:54,394 --> 01:01:56,828
You forgot your bag of tricks.

680
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:04,101
He's a deceiver, Michael.

681
01:02:07,206 --> 01:02:09,606
He's a deceiver.

682
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,641
Hold on. Hold on, Rosaria.

683
01:04:27,262 --> 01:04:30,720
<i>This is a tragedy. How could this happen?</i>

684
01:04:31,266 --> 01:04:35,896
Who worked here today?
I want to talk with everyone.

685
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:41,336
Tell me about the mother.

686
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:46,213
There was internal bleeding,
massive hemorrhaging.

687
01:04:49,217 --> 01:04:51,082
We did everything in our power...

688
01:04:51,253 --> 01:04:54,518
...but unfortunately
we couldn't save her or her baby.

689
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,867
What now?

690
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:09,466
Oh, nothing.

691
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:11,805
It's finished.

692
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:15,933
He took a life.
That's what he wants, ultimately.

693
01:05:17,279 --> 01:05:20,077
He'll probably find someone else.

694
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:26,349
You should go home, get some rest.
You've had a hard night.

695
01:05:26,521 --> 01:05:28,352
Yeah.

696
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:33,652
Are you okay?

697
01:05:36,398 --> 01:05:37,763
I failed her.

698
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:41,225
You did what you thought was best.

699
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:43,899
Yeah.

700
01:05:50,312 --> 01:05:52,143
I gotta go.

701
01:05:54,883 --> 01:05:56,282
Take care of yourself.

702
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:04,450
You're a good man, Michael.

703
01:06:05,827 --> 01:06:08,091
You have a good soul.

704
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:10,898
Defend it.

705
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,896
Guard it.

706
01:06:13,702 --> 01:06:15,670
Cherish it.

707
01:06:18,273 --> 01:06:21,401
Oh, God. Oh, God.

708
01:06:43,999 --> 01:06:46,024
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming.

709
01:06:46,201 --> 01:06:48,829
You picked a perfect day for it.

710
01:06:49,004 --> 01:06:50,403
I appreciate you doing this.

711
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:54,839
- No names.
- No names. Promise.

712
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:57,911
There's no way she touched the baby
because she was restrained.

713
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,707
That's right.

714
01:07:00,115 --> 01:07:02,140
What do you make of that?

715
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:05,384
It's confounding.

716
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:08,289
That's the story.
It's yours to interpret as you will.

717
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,948
You can call me
if you have any questions.

718
01:07:11,126 --> 01:07:12,252
Thank you.

719
01:07:16,598 --> 01:07:18,828
What changed your mind?

720
01:07:19,134 --> 01:07:20,567
To do this?

721
01:07:21,403 --> 01:07:24,031
I just needed to tell someone.

722
01:07:26,641 --> 01:07:28,268
<i>So let me get this straight.</i>

723
01:07:28,643 --> 01:07:32,306
You ran away from home
and chose a life of celibacy?

724
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:36,079
- How bad could home be?
- It sounds stupid when you say it like that.

725
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:39,243
It sounds stupid
because it doesn't add up.

726
01:07:39,788 --> 01:07:42,586
Are you saying you never felt a calling?

727
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:45,560
My mother...

728
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:48,628
...she used to say
she felt the hand of God on me.

729
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:50,957
Did you feel it?

730
01:07:52,367 --> 01:07:54,267
I wanted to.

731
01:07:57,305 --> 01:08:00,206
- So how did you end up in all this?
- It's a long story.

732
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,036
We're not going anywhere,
so come on.

733
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:08,180
My parents committed my brother
to a mental institution when he was 19.

734
01:08:10,085 --> 01:08:11,882
He was so tormented.

735
01:08:12,053 --> 01:08:15,420
He said he heard voices
telling him to do things.

736
01:08:16,024 --> 01:08:18,891
He used to tell me
it was the devil speaking to him.

737
01:08:22,664 --> 01:08:25,861
Sometimes he would tell me
what the devil said.

738
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:32,033
And sometimes the things he said
would come true.

739
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:35,533
It frightened me.

740
01:08:36,244 --> 01:08:38,735
He frightened me.

741
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:46,152
I know it sounds terrible, but it's just
easier when I don't think about him.

742
01:09:23,491 --> 01:09:27,222
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

743
01:09:27,395 --> 01:09:29,158
<i>Blessed art thou among women...</i>

744
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:33,324
<i>... and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.</i>

745
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:35,025
<i>Holy Mary...</i>

746
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:37,868
<i>... mother of God...</i>

747
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:41,702
<i>... pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.</i>

748
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:43,640
<i>Amen.</i>

749
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

750
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:29,351
I'm sorry to wake you, Michael.

751
01:10:30,692 --> 01:10:32,717
I thought it best to tell you myself.

752
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:35,096
It's your father.

753
01:10:36,798 --> 01:10:38,527
And he hasn't regained consciousness?

754
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:41,134
<i>No. The stroke was massive.</i>

755
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:44,363
<i>He could stabilize
or he could stay like this.</i>

756
01:10:44,539 --> 01:10:45,563
I see.

757
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:49,176
<i>I'm sorry. There isn't much more
I can tell you at this point.</i>

758
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:57,376
I'm sorry, Michael.

759
01:10:57,552 --> 01:11:00,180
I'll include him in my prayers.

760
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:05,489
We can help arrange your travel.

761
01:11:07,862 --> 01:11:09,557
Thank you.

762
01:12:38,853 --> 01:12:41,321
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

763
01:12:45,193 --> 01:12:48,924
<i>Airlines are warning
passengers to expect more delays...</i>

764
01:12:49,097 --> 01:12:52,123
<i>... even when the dust from
the volcano in Iceland has settled.</i>

765
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:56,737
<i>Tonight, the ash plume has shut the
airports of 22 countries on the continent...</i>

766
01:12:56,905 --> 01:13:01,706
<i>... with Italy and Switzerland among
the latest to close their airspace.</i>

767
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:05,478
<i>Thousands of passengers are stranded,
with some being told...</i>

768
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:07,842
<i>... it could be a week
before they get another flight.</i>

769
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:09,574
<i>- Once the ash clears...
- I need a room.</i>

770
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:12,311
<i>- ... a backlog of flights...
- No problem.</i>

771
01:13:12,487 --> 01:13:16,583
<i>... will mean further disruption.
Valerie Rigg, Egetsa Coverage.</i>

772
01:13:16,758 --> 01:13:19,625
I'm calling to check
on my father's condition.

773
01:13:19,794 --> 01:13:21,421
Istvan Kovak.

774
01:13:21,596 --> 01:13:24,258
K-O-V-A-K.

775
01:13:24,432 --> 01:13:25,956
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

776
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:39,277
<i>- Michael.
- Yeah, yeah. It's Michael.</i>

777
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:41,577
<i>I'm scared.</i>

778
01:13:41,749 --> 01:13:44,274
It's okay. Dad, you're okay.

779
01:13:44,452 --> 01:13:48,445
<i>No. Something happened.</i>

780
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:52,487
<i>- It's okay, Dad.
- Where are you?</i>

781
01:13:53,294 --> 01:13:54,693
<i>I wish you were here.</i>

782
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:59,163
I'll be home soon.
Something happened with my flight.

783
01:14:00,268 --> 01:14:02,236
<i>Where am I?</i>

784
01:14:03,304 --> 01:14:05,329
You're in the hospital.

785
01:14:08,476 --> 01:14:10,637
What is it, Dad?

786
01:14:12,847 --> 01:14:14,508
Dad?

787
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,277
<i>They're hurting me.</i>

788
01:14:17,452 --> 01:14:19,113
Who?

789
01:14:20,321 --> 01:14:21,845
Dad?

790
01:14:22,023 --> 01:14:24,753
<i>- Mr. Kovak?
- Yeah.</i>

791
01:14:24,926 --> 01:14:27,486
<i>- It's Dr. Vorachian.
- Yes.</i>

792
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:32,456
<i>Mr. Kovak, I'm afraid
I've got some very bad news.</i>

793
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,068
<i>Your father passed away this afternoon.</i>

794
01:14:37,805 --> 01:14:39,739
Uh, what?

795
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:46,003
<i>Your father died this afternoon.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Kovak.</i>

796
01:14:46,581 --> 01:14:49,345
<i>Well, that's impossible. I...</i>

797
01:14:49,517 --> 01:14:52,350
I was just speaking with him, just now.

798
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:57,014
<i>Mr. Kovak, your father was
declared dead about six hours ago.</i>

799
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:59,251
<i>I was a witness.</i>

800
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:02,726
<i>I'm very sorry to have to tell you...</i>

801
01:15:31,492 --> 01:15:35,087
"Whoever lives by believing in me
will never die."

802
01:15:35,263 --> 01:15:38,232
Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy...

803
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:41,092
...Lord have mercy.

804
01:15:41,269 --> 01:15:45,603
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

805
01:15:45,773 --> 01:15:47,434
<i>May she rest in peace.</i>

806
01:16:03,124 --> 01:16:05,058
<i>Doubter!</i>

807
01:17:08,823 --> 01:17:10,757
<i>Michael.</i>

808
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:15,192
<i>A liar knows a liar.</i>

809
01:17:17,965 --> 01:17:19,796
<i>Michael, they're hurting me.</i>

810
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:21,325
Dad?

811
01:17:21,502 --> 01:17:23,333
<i>- I'm scared.
- Hey.</i>

812
01:17:27,742 --> 01:17:30,176
Wait! Dad!

813
01:17:30,378 --> 01:17:32,369
<i>- Where are you?
- Radre.</i>

814
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:33,639
<i>Radre.</i>

815
01:17:37,051 --> 01:17:38,484
<i>Don't worry.</i>

816
01:17:39,587 --> 01:17:40,679
<i>The pain is gone.</i>

817
01:17:49,897 --> 01:17:52,593
<i>There's nothing to believe.</i>

818
01:18:47,388 --> 01:18:49,117
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

819
01:18:49,757 --> 01:18:53,158
I'm hallucinating. I'm seeing things,
I'm hearing things.

820
01:18:53,327 --> 01:18:56,455
I can't explain it.

821
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:58,929
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

822
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,159
<i>Michael, what happened?</i>

823
01:19:01,335 --> 01:19:03,462
Look, I need your help.

824
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:06,266
I feel like I'm going insane.

825
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,398
Can you come meet me?

826
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:25,390
<i>He's feeling
much better since the Father prayed for him.</i>

827
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:30,087
Did Father send you?

828
01:19:32,533 --> 01:19:35,969
The other day I saw her son
whisper something to her.

829
01:19:37,004 --> 01:19:38,562
I need to know what it was.

830
01:19:39,907 --> 01:19:42,842
Your son whispered
something to you the other day.

831
01:19:44,445 --> 01:19:46,936
He's a baby.
He doesn't know what he's saying.

832
01:19:47,114 --> 01:19:50,481
Please, it's very important
that you tell us.

833
01:19:52,753 --> 01:19:54,345
Please.

834
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:08,367
He said...

835
01:20:11,472 --> 01:20:13,337
...your father was going to die.

836
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:21,506
Who told him that?

837
01:20:37,865 --> 01:20:39,332
He says you know.

838
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,025
He says you've seen it too.

839
01:20:42,403 --> 01:20:44,337
Seen what?

840
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,905
The demon.

841
01:20:47,842 --> 01:20:49,537
The mule.

842
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:56,348
- Where are you going?
- My father died last night.

843
01:20:56,517 --> 01:20:57,575
What did you say?

844
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:02,854
I said, my father died...

845
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:04,148
...last night.

846
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:07,293
Oh, God.

847
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:09,695
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

848
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:12,826
How did that kid know?

849
01:21:14,802 --> 01:21:17,168
I need to talk to Lucas.

850
01:21:53,007 --> 01:21:55,771
Bless my dolly, Father?

851
01:21:57,478 --> 01:21:58,706
Hm?

852
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

853
01:22:56,103 --> 01:22:57,695
Father?

854
01:22:58,506 --> 01:22:59,530
Father.

855
01:23:02,209 --> 01:23:04,507
Let's get you inside.

856
01:23:30,504 --> 01:23:33,962
- I don't want to lie down.
- Okay.

857
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:36,734
Then what were you doing out there?

858
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:38,845
Huh?

859
01:23:39,013 --> 01:23:41,140
I said, what were you doing out there?

860
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:49,446
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

861
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:54,022
<i>I found myself walking and I...
I think...</i>

862
01:23:54,361 --> 01:23:57,262
I think I did something awful.
It was terrible.

863
01:23:57,431 --> 01:24:01,026
I can't pray any longer because
I'm no longer in a state of grace...

864
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:03,670
<i>... and prayer is our only salvation.</i>

865
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:04,998
It's your only salvation.

866
01:24:05,172 --> 01:24:09,404
It knows you, it knows all your sins.

867
01:24:11,545 --> 01:24:13,740
Secrets.

868
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:26,284
So you'll need help.

869
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:28,519
- With what?
- You'll have to lock me up.

870
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:29,822
Go find Father Xavier.

871
01:24:30,197 --> 01:24:32,825
Because it is strong...

872
01:24:33,734 --> 01:24:36,567
...this thing, this terror.

873
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:51,977
The terror is real, Michael.

874
01:24:54,188 --> 01:24:55,849
<i>It's real.</i>

875
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:59,259
But you'll only defeat it
when you believe.

876
01:25:04,498 --> 01:25:06,227
So go now, lock me up.

877
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,925
Go now. Lock me up!

878
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:16,343
I think Father Xavier has left for the day.

879
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:18,034
Please. It's very urgent.

880
01:25:18,212 --> 01:25:20,544
He's going to Civitavecchia
for the weekend.

881
01:25:20,714 --> 01:25:22,682
What's his cell number?

882
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:34,327
<i>Hello, this is Father Xavier.</i>

883
01:25:34,495 --> 01:25:37,555
<i>I am currently unavailable.
Leave a message after the tone.</i>

884
01:25:38,999 --> 01:25:42,059
This is Michael Kovak. There's
a serious problem with Father Lucas.

885
01:25:42,236 --> 01:25:43,828
Contact me. I'm going to his house.

886
01:26:17,371 --> 01:26:21,068
He belongs to me now.

887
01:26:47,868 --> 01:26:49,392
Michael.

888
01:26:51,238 --> 01:26:52,762
What was that?

889
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What?

890
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:10,948
I don't know.

891
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:16,519
<i>Lover of my soul</i>

892
01:27:16,697 --> 01:27:21,999
<i>Let me to thy bosom fly</i>

893
01:27:22,169 --> 01:27:24,228
<i>When the nearer...</i>

894
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:28,506
Father?

895
01:27:29,109 --> 01:27:31,043
I'm afraid he's out.

896
01:27:31,211 --> 01:27:33,202
Come in, please.

897
01:27:38,018 --> 01:27:39,315
Ah.

898
01:27:40,821 --> 01:27:43,187
So shall we begin?

899
01:27:43,557 --> 01:27:45,525
In time, Father.

900
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:47,024
I told you, he's not here.

901
01:27:47,227 --> 01:27:48,888
Then who are you?

902
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:50,894
I'm just an old friend.

903
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:53,863
- "Friend"?
- Yeah.

904
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:56,665
I'm not sure I follow you.

905
01:27:57,004 --> 01:27:59,666
Oh, you follow me, Michael.

906
01:28:01,008 --> 01:28:03,169
You've always followed me.

907
01:28:04,244 --> 01:28:07,736
Did you enjoy our gift,
the one we hung on your door?

908
01:28:08,182 --> 01:28:10,446
You following me now...

909
01:28:11,085 --> 01:28:12,882
...Michael?

910
01:28:14,254 --> 01:28:16,119
Close the door, please.

911
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:18,087
We don't want to be disturbed, do we?

912
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:27,593
Your father says to say hello,
by the way.

913
01:28:28,268 --> 01:28:30,168
Hell-o.

914
01:28:30,337 --> 01:28:31,634
You don't know my father.

915
01:28:31,805 --> 01:28:35,070
Oh, he says he enjoyed
his final little chat with you.

916
01:28:35,542 --> 01:28:38,033
I'm guessing you didn't enjoy it
as much.

917
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:41,545
- You're a liar.
- Yes, that's what they all tell me.

918
01:28:41,715 --> 01:28:43,979
Your father died at 4:20 P.M...

919
01:28:44,151 --> 01:28:47,314
...in the same miserable hospital
in which your mother died...

920
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:50,946
...or passed away, as they say.
And his last conscious moments...

921
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:55,084
...were full of panic and full of terror.

922
01:28:55,262 --> 01:29:00,222
Alone in that house of the dead
with no family to hold his hand...

923
01:29:00,801 --> 01:29:04,100
...no loved ones to kiss him goodbye.

924
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:07,739
Because you deserted him, Michael...

925
01:29:07,908 --> 01:29:12,743
...and this caused him great pain,
you know, in the end.

926
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,171
You hurt him most.

927
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:18,479
And all for God.

928
01:29:18,652 --> 01:29:19,880
Are you reading my mind?

929
01:29:22,389 --> 01:29:24,755
Yes. No.

930
01:29:24,925 --> 01:29:27,621
<i>Maybe. No. Yes. Rerhaps.</i>

931
01:29:28,028 --> 01:29:30,724
- Are you reading mine?
- What am I thinking now?

932
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:33,867
Oh, you're so tedious,
you little piece of mouse shit.

933
01:29:34,034 --> 01:29:35,501
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

934
01:29:35,669 --> 01:29:39,230
You couldn't even stand up to your father,
could you? Your daddy, your mommy.

935
01:29:39,406 --> 01:29:41,499
- Mikey, Mikey, Mikey!
- Stand back!

936
01:29:41,675 --> 01:29:44,041
- You don't command me.
- No, God does.

937
01:29:44,211 --> 01:29:49,114
Oh, God does. Is that so? Wow, cool.
Awesome. Whatever, dude.

938
01:29:49,283 --> 01:29:50,875
You and your puking truth!

939
01:29:51,051 --> 01:29:54,111
You are nothing! You know nothing!

940
01:29:54,321 --> 01:29:56,221
Doubter!

941
01:29:57,524 --> 01:29:58,923
Cherish your doubts, Michael.

942
01:30:00,294 --> 01:30:02,558
Jesus, lover of my soul.
This is lovely, isn't it?

943
01:30:02,729 --> 01:30:04,754
Oh, I will never leave you. I will never.

944
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:08,993
So please, Mr. Preacher Man, please,
Mr. Priest, pray for God to help me.

945
01:30:09,169 --> 01:30:11,262
Me, I'm just a poor little Welshman.

946
01:30:11,438 --> 01:30:15,807
All dressed up for the carnival, Mommy.

947
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:21,338
God is not here, priest.

948
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

949
01:30:42,536 --> 01:30:44,970
Oh, God, help me!

950
01:30:45,172 --> 01:30:46,469
God help me!

951
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:51,603
God help me!

952
01:30:51,778 --> 01:30:53,609
God help me!

953
01:31:08,929 --> 01:31:10,863
Michael...

954
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:13,697
...what's happening to me?

955
01:31:13,934 --> 01:31:16,300
- Oh, God help me.
- Father.

956
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:18,062
Tie me up. Tie me up.

957
01:31:18,605 --> 01:31:19,936
Angelina!

958
01:31:23,677 --> 01:31:25,201
Angelina!

959
01:31:26,613 --> 01:31:28,672
Angelina!

960
01:31:31,852 --> 01:31:33,342
Help me.

961
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:38,986
Now!

962
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:59,006
- Now what?
- I don't know.

963
01:31:59,179 --> 01:32:02,876
- Maybe we should wait for Father Xavier.
- We can't keep him tied up till Monday.

964
01:32:26,373 --> 01:32:29,308
If you don't wanna do this,
I'll understand.

965
01:32:30,744 --> 01:32:32,336
No.

966
01:32:32,512 --> 01:32:34,980
This is what I asked to see.

967
01:32:47,127 --> 01:32:49,595
<i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son...</i>

968
01:32:49,763 --> 01:32:52,095
<i>... and of the Holy Spirit,
bless this, your servant.</i>

969
01:32:52,266 --> 01:32:54,734
Keep her safe from harm,
protect her from evil. Amen.

970
01:32:55,035 --> 01:32:56,627
Amen.

971
01:32:56,903 --> 01:32:58,530
Amen.

972
01:32:58,705 --> 01:32:59,899
Just repeat what I say.

973
01:33:00,073 --> 01:33:01,836
Just repeat what he says, honey.

974
01:33:02,009 --> 01:33:03,601
- Lord, have mercy.
- Have mercy.

975
01:33:03,777 --> 01:33:05,244
- Unbeliever.
- Christ, have mercy.

976
01:33:05,412 --> 01:33:06,504
- Have mercy.
- Doubter!

977
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,409
- Lord, have mercy.
- Lord, have mercy.

978
01:33:08,582 --> 01:33:10,948
Hell has no mercy!
I took the priest, I'll take you.

979
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:12,344
Let us pray.

980
01:33:12,519 --> 01:33:14,612
"Save this man, Lucas Trevant,
your servant."

981
01:33:14,788 --> 01:33:15,812
I'm no servant.

982
01:33:15,989 --> 01:33:18,184
- Because he hopes in you, God.
- Hope is dead!

983
01:33:18,358 --> 01:33:20,792
Let the enemy have no victory
over him. Lord, hear us.

984
01:33:20,961 --> 01:33:21,985
Lord, hear us.

985
01:33:22,162 --> 01:33:25,563
He can't hear you, he's not here.
God is dead!

986
01:33:36,343 --> 01:33:38,538
Drive out, O Lord,
the power of the devil.

987
01:33:38,712 --> 01:33:41,010
Hey, Angie, has he done it to you yet?

988
01:33:41,648 --> 01:33:44,139
That's what he wants.
That's what you want too, right?

989
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:46,582
Be protected and safeguarded
in body and soul.

990
01:33:46,753 --> 01:33:48,345
Hey, Mikey, I think she likes you.

991
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:49,921
Nice titties, yeah?

992
01:33:50,657 --> 01:33:52,955
I invoke your holy name
and humbly request...

993
01:33:53,126 --> 01:33:56,254
<i>- ...that you snatch from this demon...
- Pokey hokey, pocus holy...</i>

994
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:58,728
- ...this man who was created in...
- Created in sin.

995
01:33:58,899 --> 01:34:02,130
- Who was created in your likeness.
- In your likeness of sin and filth.

996
01:34:02,302 --> 01:34:04,862
In the name of your Lord,
Jesus Christ, your son.

997
01:34:05,038 --> 01:34:06,903
- Climb up on my knees, sonny boy.
- Amen.

998
01:34:07,074 --> 01:34:08,405
Amen.

999
01:34:08,675 --> 01:34:12,873
Amen.

1000
01:34:32,499 --> 01:34:34,899
By the mysteries of the incarnation...

1001
01:34:35,068 --> 01:34:39,095
...the suffering, the death and resurrection
and ascension of our Lord, Jesus Christ...

1002
01:34:39,272 --> 01:34:42,400
"...I command you.
By some sign, give me your name."

1003
01:34:50,217 --> 01:34:51,707
Your name, demon.

1004
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,983
Your name, demon.

1005
01:34:55,155 --> 01:34:56,986
Tell me your name!

1006
01:35:15,108 --> 01:35:16,666
My love.

1007
01:35:16,843 --> 01:35:18,037
My flower.

1008
01:35:19,212 --> 01:35:22,010
My beautiful.

1009
01:35:40,667 --> 01:35:43,534
Hey, Daddy's calling from hell.

1010
01:35:54,648 --> 01:35:56,206
Michael.

1011
01:35:57,217 --> 01:35:59,117
Michael.

1012
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,520
What happened?

1013
01:36:02,689 --> 01:36:04,748
I can't do it.

1014
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:07,655
It's more than just saying the words.

1015
01:36:09,296 --> 01:36:13,255
You've seen him.
What's not to believe in?

1016
01:36:14,968 --> 01:36:16,697
Me.

1017
01:36:18,438 --> 01:36:20,736
Don't you understand?

1018
01:36:21,808 --> 01:36:23,935
Then why are you here?

1019
01:36:27,614 --> 01:36:30,742
Something brought you here, Michael.

1020
01:36:31,084 --> 01:36:33,678
All the decisions you made.

1021
01:36:34,354 --> 01:36:37,653
You left your home, your father.

1022
01:36:38,391 --> 01:36:40,382
You came here.

1023
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:44,925
It all led to this.

1024
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:48,326
It's fate.

1025
01:36:48,635 --> 01:36:51,035
You're not alone.

1026
01:36:55,775 --> 01:36:57,970
What did you just say?

1027
01:36:59,045 --> 01:37:01,309
You're not alone.

1028
01:37:51,031 --> 01:37:52,430
Michael.

1029
01:37:53,533 --> 01:37:54,557
Father.

1030
01:37:55,302 --> 01:37:56,826
Give up.

1031
01:37:57,270 --> 01:38:00,103
You don't have the strength.
You don't have the faith.

1032
01:38:00,273 --> 01:38:01,433
Just pray, Michael.

1033
01:38:03,076 --> 01:38:04,168
Well, hello, Angie.

1034
01:38:04,344 --> 01:38:06,278
And the Holy Spirit. Amen.

1035
01:38:06,446 --> 01:38:07,970
May I ask you a question?

1036
01:38:09,082 --> 01:38:11,073
When was the last time
you saw your brother?

1037
01:38:11,251 --> 01:38:13,651
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

1038
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:15,287
You little slut.

1039
01:38:15,956 --> 01:38:17,184
Don't listen.

1040
01:38:17,357 --> 01:38:19,882
Oh, don't listen. But isn't that
what you did, Angie?

1041
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:22,688
Not listen to him? Your little brother.

1042
01:38:22,862 --> 01:38:27,731
Leaving him to rot away in that stinking
booby hatch, turning your back on him...

1043
01:38:27,901 --> 01:38:30,768
...when he was being strangled
by his own screams.

1044
01:38:30,937 --> 01:38:33,963
Do you remember that, Angie?
Do you remember?

1045
01:38:34,808 --> 01:38:37,174
You will never forget.

1046
01:38:37,344 --> 01:38:39,175
So we do what we do with him now.

1047
01:38:39,346 --> 01:38:44,113
He's living in the land of misery
and dread, thanks to big sister.

1048
01:38:45,418 --> 01:38:49,650
Oh, why the tears, sweetie pie?
I thought you wanted the truth.

1049
01:38:49,823 --> 01:38:52,792
Like laughing boy here.
He just lives for the truth.

1050
01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:54,756
Isn't that so, Mikey?

1051
01:38:54,928 --> 01:38:56,418
Just leave her alone.

1052
01:38:56,596 --> 01:39:00,430
You think I don't know all your festering
secrets? Your nickel-and-dime sins?

1053
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:03,225
You were ashamed of your father,
he was ashamed of you.

1054
01:39:03,403 --> 01:39:05,496
You hated him, he hated you back.

1055
01:39:06,306 --> 01:39:08,797
It was a charming family.

1056
01:39:09,209 --> 01:39:13,339
How could God possibly love you
when your daddy didn't? Hm?

1057
01:39:13,513 --> 01:39:17,950
No. You were never
meant for God, Michael.

1058
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:20,586
You were always meant for me, honey.

1059
01:39:20,787 --> 01:39:21,845
Enough!

1060
01:39:24,858 --> 01:39:26,985
Oopsie-daisy.

1061
01:39:27,327 --> 01:39:29,625
Close to home.

1062
01:39:30,997 --> 01:39:35,661
And that was no squeaky angel
your mother saw all those years ago.

1063
01:39:36,369 --> 01:39:37,461
<i>No.</i>

1064
01:39:37,837 --> 01:39:39,099
'Twas I.

1065
01:39:40,674 --> 01:39:43,336
<i>You chose me long, long ago...</i>

1066
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:48,504
<i>... when you were just an itsy-bitsy
little boy pooping in his pants.</i>

1067
01:39:48,682 --> 01:39:49,706
<i>Remember, Michael.</i>

1068
01:39:49,883 --> 01:39:51,407
You remember, Michael?

1069
01:39:51,584 --> 01:39:53,552
<i>Remember when you bent that cross?</i>

1070
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:56,052
<i>If only you remember.</i>

1071
01:39:56,222 --> 01:39:57,621
<i>Remember, Michael. Remember.</i>

1072
01:39:57,791 --> 01:39:59,850
Remember.

1073
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:03,726
Oh, dear.

1074
01:40:03,897 --> 01:40:07,526
<i>Our poor little savior all alone on his cross.</i>

1075
01:40:09,002 --> 01:40:10,060
Yeah.

1076
01:40:10,236 --> 01:40:13,296
God chose you, Michael.
That's why you're here.

1077
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:15,164
Just accept it.

1078
01:40:15,341 --> 01:40:16,865
- Yeah.
- Accept God.

1079
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>- Accept the devil.
- You can't win without him.</i>
No.
<i>All alone.</i>

1080
01:40:26,653 --> 01:40:27,677
No!

1081
01:40:38,598 --> 01:40:43,160
Shall I pour the sick and rotting truth
of the dying world...

1082
01:40:43,336 --> 01:40:46,464
...into your precious, golden womb?

1083
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:49,840
You remember his strangling screams...

1084
01:40:50,009 --> 01:40:53,206
...when you turned your back on him
and walked away?

1085
01:40:53,379 --> 01:40:57,679
You wanted the truth, little lady.
Well, here I am.

1086
01:41:01,254 --> 01:41:03,347
So how about you, kissy lips?

1087
01:41:07,427 --> 01:41:10,260
Do you feel that probing around
inside you, Michael?

1088
01:41:10,430 --> 01:41:12,091
Lucas, listen to me, please.

1089
01:41:12,265 --> 01:41:14,665
Lucas is not here.

1090
01:41:14,834 --> 01:41:16,199
He's never coming back.

1091
01:41:18,505 --> 01:41:22,805
You feel that digging and scraping around
inside you like God's dirty fingernail?

1092
01:41:23,843 --> 01:41:26,243
Do you believe in me now, Michael?

1093
01:41:27,514 --> 01:41:30,142
Do you believe in me now?

1094
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:32,650
Yes.

1095
01:41:33,987 --> 01:41:35,955
Yes. I believe in you.

1096
01:41:38,958 --> 01:41:41,051
I believe in the devil.

1097
01:42:04,851 --> 01:42:06,079
<i>I believe in you...</i>

1098
01:42:08,054 --> 01:42:09,681
...so I believe in God.

1099
01:42:12,325 --> 01:42:15,317
I accept him in this moment.
I accept God.

1100
01:42:16,196 --> 01:42:19,529
I believe in God the Father,
the maker of heaven and earth...

1101
01:42:19,699 --> 01:42:22,224
...of all that is seen and unseen.

1102
01:42:22,402 --> 01:42:24,302
I believe.

1103
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:27,803
I exorcise you, most unclean spirit.

1104
01:42:27,974 --> 01:42:30,499
Warp of vices, creator of agony.

1105
01:42:30,677 --> 01:42:33,373
In the name of Jesus Christ,
leave this man.

1106
01:42:33,546 --> 01:42:36,071
In the name of the Virgin Mary,
leave now.

1107
01:42:36,282 --> 01:42:37,408
I command you.

1108
01:42:37,851 --> 01:42:39,341
I, who believe.

1109
01:42:39,519 --> 01:42:41,578
In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ...

1110
01:42:41,754 --> 01:42:44,552
...be uprooted and expelled
from this creature of God.

1111
01:42:44,724 --> 01:42:47,659
He who commands you is he
who ordered you to be thrown down...

1112
01:42:47,827 --> 01:42:50,352
...from the highest heaven
into the depths of hell.

1113
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:53,499
Hear therefore and fear,
Satan, enemy of faith.

1114
01:42:53,666 --> 01:42:57,534
Fear him who was crucified as man
and who rose from death!

1115
01:42:59,706 --> 01:43:01,435
I will never leave you, Michael.

1116
01:43:04,978 --> 01:43:07,572
I will never leave you.

1117
01:43:20,226 --> 01:43:21,716
Speak your name.

1118
01:43:24,030 --> 01:43:27,864
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command you, speak your name.

1119
01:43:32,071 --> 01:43:35,973
In the name of the Holy Spirit,
I command you. Give me your name!

1120
01:43:37,877 --> 01:43:40,744
It is God who commands you!
Your name!

1121
01:43:41,114 --> 01:43:42,445
Your name!

1122
01:43:42,615 --> 01:43:43,912
Give me your name!

1123
01:43:45,251 --> 01:43:47,947
Ba'al!

1124
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:52,452
Ba'al!

1125
01:43:54,327 --> 01:43:57,854
Ba'al!

1126
01:43:59,465 --> 01:44:05,495
Ba'al!

1127
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:19,612
I know you, Ba'al.

1128
01:44:19,786 --> 01:44:23,779
And I command you, retire therefore.

1129
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:26,888
Depart from this place. Leave!

1130
01:44:27,393 --> 01:44:28,985
Surrender now.

1131
01:44:29,162 --> 01:44:33,531
In the name of the Father, and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...

1132
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:35,827
...forever and ever.

1133
01:46:05,858 --> 01:46:08,258
It's good as new, huh?

1134
01:46:08,494 --> 01:46:09,984
Yeah.

1135
01:46:10,897 --> 01:46:13,229
Well, she wasn't a bad little bike.

1136
01:46:13,399 --> 01:46:15,299
You know, back in her golden days...

1137
01:46:15,468 --> 01:46:17,629
...she brought me out here
all those years ago.

1138
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:19,996
<i>Anyway...</i>

1139
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:22,366
So you're off. You're leaving.

1140
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:24,066
Yeah, that's right.

1141
01:46:24,243 --> 01:46:28,077
Well, I hope you find your place
in the world one of these fine days.

1142
01:46:28,648 --> 01:46:30,172
- I hope so.
- Now, when you do...

1143
01:46:30,349 --> 01:46:33,147
...don't forget to say a few prayers
for an old sinner.

1144
01:46:33,786 --> 01:46:37,347
Throw a couple of Hail Marys this way
if that's not too much trouble.

1145
01:46:37,523 --> 01:46:38,547
That a deal?

1146
01:46:38,958 --> 01:46:41,722
- It's a deal.
- Good.

1147
01:46:44,130 --> 01:46:46,030
You know, the first day
you showed up...

1148
01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:49,862
...I thought you were so full of it, I was
tempted to kick you into the street.

1149
01:46:50,036 --> 01:46:53,870
But I didn't because I saw
quite a bit of myself in you.

1150
01:46:55,108 --> 01:46:56,939
Scary, isn't it?

1151
01:46:57,944 --> 01:47:01,505
- Yeah, it sure is.
- Yeah.

1152
01:47:01,914 --> 01:47:06,146
All right, that's it. Thanks for everything.
Safe journey. And one other thing.

1153
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:09,288
Faith becomes you. Stay with it.

1154
01:47:09,455 --> 01:47:13,824
Keep fighting the good fight
with all thy might.

1155
01:47:15,361 --> 01:47:17,090
Cool.

1156
01:47:18,564 --> 01:47:20,088
Get out of here.

1157
01:47:25,438 --> 01:47:27,406
Goodbye, Father.

1158
01:49:11,477 --> 01:49:14,378
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1159
01:49:14,547 --> 01:49:18,108
It has been six weeks
since my last confession.

1160
01:49:18,584 --> 01:49:20,916
And what are your sins?

1161
01:49:22,455 --> 01:49:29,327
Father Michael Kovak is one of 14 exorcists
practicing in the United States today. He now works
out of his parish near Chicago.

1162
01:49:31,130 --> 01:49:37,797
Father Lucas Trevant has performed over
two thousand exorcisms. He continues to practice
in a township outside of Florence.
