2
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:50,409
Ah!

3
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:22,905
Aah!

4
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:52,865
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

5
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:56,465
It's Saturday.

6
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:59,771
And Saturday means pancakes,
your favorite.

7
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:05,245
Breakfast in five minutes,
mister.

8
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:22,394
Ah.

9
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:36,541
Thank you.

10
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:43,716
Ew, gross!

11
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,423
Really?

12
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:54,990
Was it gross
when you kissed Roxy

13
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:56,959
at the Sadie Hawkins dance?

14
00:04:56,961 --> 00:05:00,397
Mom, I-I-I did not!
No, I...

15
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,598
Dominic told me all about it.

16
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,901
She's a very nice girl, Stanley.

17
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:07,503
I'm gonna kill Dommer.

18
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,707
All right, honey,
you're embarrassing him.

19
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,613
Hey, kid, what do you say

20
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:18,548
we head up to the cabin
this weekend, just me and you?

21
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,649
On the way up,
we can work on your driving.

22
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:22,151
All right, yeah!

23
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:24,086
What am I supposed to do
while the two of you

24
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:26,389
are out gallivanting
in the woods?

25
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:27,990
Stay here by myself?

26
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:30,793
Yeah, I'm sorry, honey, but this
weekend's just for the men.

27
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,428
Am I right, son?

28
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,531
Yep, men only, no moms allowed.

29
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:38,403
Okay.
All right.

30
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:45,077
Mom?

31
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:47,577
Mom!

32
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,846
Mom! Mom! No, no!

33
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:52,852
Mom, Mom, no!
No, no, please, no! No!

34
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,985
Dad, please don't do that!
Dad, please don't! Dad!

35
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,936
Shit.

36
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,373
Oh, my God.

37
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:30,921
God damn it!

38
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,623
How many times have I told you
not to lock this door?

39
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:50,810
Will you look at yourself?

40
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,480
What, you're going to school
in those rags you slept in?

41
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:59,248
You answer me when
I'm talking to you, boy!

42
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,718
Jesus.
Trouble with you kids today.

43
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,152
You have no sense of respect.

44
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:07,623
Hell, and you, you have
no respect for authority!

45
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,925
You have no respect

46
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:10,993
for the sacrifices I made
for this country.

47
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:13,697
Hell, when I was your age,
I was shipped overseas,

48
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,966
and I went to war
for this country

49
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,267
'cause I stood up
for the things I believed in

50
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:21,704
and I didn't let anyone
push me around!

51
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:23,572
Problem with you kids today
is you have...

52
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:25,074
you have no sense of duty!

53
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:27,276
You have no sense
of responsibility!

54
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:29,449
- You have no sense at all.
- No sense at all!

55
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:33,048
Now, you watch what you say
to me, boy.

56
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,885
You just watch
that mouth of yours!

57
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,656
I thought you learned
that lesson already.

58
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:39,856
Look at me!

59
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,627
Look at me when
I'm talking to you, boy.

60
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:46,296
Now, let's get something
straight, shall we?

61
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:50,534
I am the only reason
you're not still living

62
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,269
in that juvenile hellhole
no more.

63
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:56,007
So as long as you're
under this roof...

64
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,911
...my rules.

65
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:01,646
Am I clear?

66
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,987
Am... I... clear?

67
00:08:10,254 --> 00:08:11,557
Yeah.

68
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:13,789
What?

69
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,760
Yes, sir.

70
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:29,272
Excuse me.

71
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:31,308
That's right.

72
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,047
You just run away
like you always do.

73
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:38,950
And you keep on running!

74
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:43,719
Those problems of yours, they're
gonna come up behind you, boy,

75
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:45,921
and they're gonna bite you
right in the...

76
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:27,363
Is that fucking Stanley?

77
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:30,900
Whoo!

78
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:33,236
Watch out, Stanley!
Ha ha!

79
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:35,308
- Whoa! Fucking pussy!
- Watch out for that tree.

80
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,344
Oh, shit.

81
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:44,280
Stanley, what the hell
are you doing?

82
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:45,248
Sorry.

83
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,218
Boy. Cripes!

84
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,085
You can't be running
into sheriff's cars.

85
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:51,087
Shit.

86
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,022
You're supposed to be in school.

87
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:55,157
Yeah, that's where I'm going.
That's why I'm in such a hurry.

88
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,795
Try keeping your eyes
on the road!

89
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,670
Ah, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

90
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,277
You sure are lucky there's
no damage there, aren't you?

91
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,945
Yeah, I-I guess so.

92
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:19,949
You guess so?
The answer was, "Yes."

93
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:20,849
Okay, yes.

94
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:22,786
Stanley...

95
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,388
don't you got a 18th birthday
coming up soon?

96
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,391
Uh, yeah, next month.

97
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:30,392
- Yeah.
- Why?

98
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:31,997
You know what that means,
don't you?

99
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:35,699
No more juvie hall.

100
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,801
No more second chances
or slaps on the wrist.

101
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:42,906
Next time, you play for keeps,
and the second you screw up,

102
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:46,242
just one little screw-up,
and I'll be right up your ass.

103
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:47,779
You got it?

104
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:51,013
I'm sure you're looking forward
to getting up my ass,

105
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:52,150
Deputy Dave.

106
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:55,350
All right.
Dave, you know what?

107
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:56,886
That's enough.

108
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:58,854
All right?
Stanley, just go to school.

109
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:00,857
Okay.
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:02,360
Get your tires pumped up.

111
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:08,164
Let's go, Dave.

112
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,236
Why do you cut that kid
so much slack?

113
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:14,871
The only thing a kid like that
understands is hard discipline.

114
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:17,206
That kid needs to catch a break.

115
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,244
Or a little jail time.

116
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,281
Or a little break.

117
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:10,259
Unbutton it.
I look down.

118
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,262
And it looked like
a jungle safari, dude.

119
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:16,031
Like, smelled so bad,
and then Dommer's mom came.

120
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,499
Shut the fuck up, Marble.

121
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:19,134
- Huh?
- Whoa.

122
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:21,003
What'd you say,
you fucking homo?

123
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:23,071
Fucking friend!
Fuck you, too!

124
00:12:23,073 --> 00:12:25,208
- Dick.
- How's your mom doing, anyway?

125
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,408
Get your hand off me.

126
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,411
Get your fucking hand off me.

127
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:30,012
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

128
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:32,848
Dick.

129
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,217
Fucking sick.

130
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:35,584
- No! All right.
- Leave him alone!

131
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:37,954
Come on, dude, let's go.
Let's go.

132
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:39,855
What's the matter, can't stand
up for yourself, freak boy?

133
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:41,156
- Fuck you!
- You need your boyfriend

134
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:42,324
- to protect you, huh?
- You dick.

135
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:44,026
You ever been hit before,
Marble?

136
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:45,060
No, I haven't. What,
are you gonna do something?

137
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:46,932
- Maybe.
- Do it.

138
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:50,499
- Break it up.
- Eat shit and die, orphan.

139
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:52,100
Eat shit and live, asshole.

140
00:12:52,102 --> 00:12:53,536
Get to class!

141
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,473
The bell rang five minutes ago,
people.

142
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:59,275
None of you should
be standing here.

143
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:01,176
- Stanley.
- Roxy, let's go.

144
00:13:01,178 --> 00:13:03,313
Get to class right now!

145
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,848
Yeah. Yeah. All right.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

146
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,052
- Agreed.
- Language.

147
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,588
Fuck those stupid fucks,
bunch of fucking pussies.

148
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,523
Dommer.
Dude, just calm down.

149
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:16,158
- Let it go.
- Calm down?

150
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,060
I mean, I deal with their
fucking shit every day.

151
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:19,365
I'm tired of it.

152
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:23,266
Telling you, man, one day
they're gonna go too far,

153
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:24,600
and they're gonna be sorry.

154
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:25,969
What are you gonna do?

155
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,405
I'm gonna fucking kill them.

156
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:30,506
Next time,
I won't save your ass.

157
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:33,278
Who says I need you
to save my ass?

158
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,344
Are you serious?

159
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:36,579
Oh, no, you're right. Yeah.

160
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:38,381
I can handle my shit, man.

161
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:41,917
If you'd let me get up in there,
I would have knocked Marble out.

162
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:44,087
Then I would have knocked
Mr. Deere out, too.

163
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,521
Mr. Deere is such a tool.

164
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:47,190
He's a creeper, man.

165
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:49,525
I see him hanging around
the Roller Castle Friday nights.

166
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:51,426
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

167
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:53,296
What are you doing at
Roller Castle on Friday nights?

168
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:55,632
I just... kind of chill there.

169
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,571
I mean, I can't afford skates.

170
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:08,645
So you ever gonna
ask Roxy out again,

171
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,179
or you just gonna
spank one out to her

172
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:12,281
every day till graduation?

173
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:14,217
I don't know
what you're talking about.

174
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:15,984
Dude, you think
I don't know that shit?

175
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:17,453
It's written all over your face.

176
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:19,988
You're always staring at her
all puppy-eyed.

177
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,925
- It's embarrassing.
- She's just my friend.

178
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,661
- That's it.
- You're so full of shit.

179
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,963
You've been trying to get
in her pants every day

180
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:29,132
since eighth grade
when she let you feel her up

181
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,599
in Marco Richie's basement.

182
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:32,334
Remember that?

183
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:34,570
The real reason you hate Marble
and those shitheads

184
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:36,406
is 'cause she ditched us
for them,

185
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,373
not 'cause they mess with me.

186
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,243
Look, man, people change.
She just outgrew us.

187
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:43,412
- That's all.
- Outgrew us, my ass.

188
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:45,113
She ditched us for that wasteoid

189
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:48,417
'cause he had a cool car
or whatever bullshit reason,

190
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:50,453
and he probably pumped her
and dumped her,

191
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:53,623
and she still won't be caught
dead hanging with us no more.

192
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,124
You know, she's not
fooling anyone.

193
00:14:56,126 --> 00:15:00,228
Everyone knows her mom's white
trash, her stepdad's a psycho,

194
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,730
and she lives here
on the South Side

195
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:04,334
with all the other trash
in this shit-hole town.

196
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,169
It's like she's trying
to be someone else,

197
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,537
- and you know it scabs you, too.
- No, that's bullshit.

198
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:10,339
- It's not bullshit.
- It's absolute bullshit.

199
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:12,041
First of all, who cares what
anyone in this shit town thinks?

200
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:13,642
You think I care?
Hell no.

201
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:15,445
And then you grow up
the way she did,

202
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,213
of course you want
to be someone else.

203
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:18,513
The way we did?

204
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:20,418
I mean, our lives
are just as screwed up.

205
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:23,652
You're pissed off she doesn't
want to sit on this rotten couch

206
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:25,421
drinking warm,
shitty beer with us.

207
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:27,089
That makes two of us, man.

208
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:29,260
We'd take the opportunity
to get out of here, too.

209
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:33,197
So just get over yourself
and stop ragging on Roxy, man.

210
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:37,335
See, you still dig her.
It's embarrassing.

211
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:45,440
All right, dick.
I'm going.

212
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:46,575
Oh, come on. Don't do that.
Stick around.

213
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:48,243
No, I can't.

214
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:50,246
My grandpa's gonna have a stroke
if I don't get back.

215
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:51,613
W-What do you care
if he shits and dies?

216
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:53,281
He croaks, you're a free bird.

217
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:55,050
It'd be the best thing
that ever happened to you.

218
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:58,490
No, if he croaks, I end up
back in state care, dumbass.

219
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:02,190
See you around,
you piece of shit.

220
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:03,593
Bye.

221
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:42,565
Dommer.

222
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:26,174
Hey, Stanley!
Where the hell are you, boy?

223
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,612
Stanley!

224
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:32,651
You get your ass down here
and mow that damn lawn!

225
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,750
Stay the hell out of my beer!

226
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,701
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

227
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:00,412
Ah.

228
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,157
It's okay.
It's okay.

229
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,328
All right?
Nothing's out there.

230
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:40,618
Mow the lawn yourself, prick.
Okay.

231
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:44,288
Ah, shit.

232
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:01,573
What the hell?

233
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Ah!

234
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,865
Freakin' crackhead.

235
00:19:33,003 --> 00:19:34,970
All right. All right.
Hold on.

236
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:36,375
Stay there.

237
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:39,874
All right.
Come on.

238
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,544
Let's go get him.

239
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:43,379
All right, man!

240
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:44,846
I'm gonna give you to the count
of 10 to get out of there,

241
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:46,582
or I'm gonna let
my dog loose on you!

242
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:50,489
I'll let you leave!
Just get the hell out of there!

243
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:54,422
I'm not fucking around, man!
I'll let my dog on you!

244
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:58,460
Come on, get out of there!

245
00:19:58,462 --> 00:19:59,964
Get out of there,
or I'm gonna let him go!

246
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:09,438
All right.
That's it.

247
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,672
Go. Go!

248
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,461
Ike?

249
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:36,367
Ike?

250
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,306
Ike!

251
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:08,797
What the hell's
all the racket in here?

252
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,334
What the goddamn hell
you doing, boy?!

253
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:14,536
T-There's a psycho in the shed!
He killed Ike!

254
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:16,037
Don't you give me
any of your bullshit!

255
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,507
I'm telling you the truth,
Grandpa. He's dead!

256
00:21:21,778 --> 00:21:22,644
Ike!

257
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:24,816
Ike!

258
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:31,956
Where's my dog?

259
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:43,498
Wait.
Wait, Grandpa.

260
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,735
Grandpa, let's wait two seconds,
and let's call the sheriff.

261
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,904
Grandpa!

262
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:49,404
That imbecile.

263
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:52,711
She couldn't screw her way out
of a paper bag.

264
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:55,446
I'll handle this.

265
00:22:34,684 --> 00:22:36,754
You son of a bitch!

266
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:50,535
Here, hold this.
Hold this!

267
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,708
All right, you sorry
sack of shit!

268
00:22:57,575 --> 00:22:58,908
I'm gonna give you
to the count of three

269
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,609
to come out of there
on your own!

270
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:03,077
If you do, I might just let you
crawl out of here

271
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,816
with your ass intact!

272
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:10,121
One!

273
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:17,661
Two!

274
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,500
Wait, Grandpa.

275
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,408
Three!

276
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:39,550
All right, asshole.
It's your funeral.

277
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,023
Grandpa!
Let's wait!

278
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:05,943
Grandpa!

279
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:12,750
Oh, come on.
Oh, no.

280
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:17,920
Oh, you really
shit the bed this time, boy,

281
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:21,724
'cause there ain't nobody
in there except my dead dog!

282
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,726
Now, you get yourself in here...

283
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

284
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:43,081
Aah!

285
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- No! No! No! No!
- Aah!
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

286
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:52,490
Stanley!

287
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:44,742
Ah.

288
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:00,825
Shit.

289
00:26:02,926 --> 00:26:04,929
Shit.

290
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

291
00:27:28,945 --> 00:27:29,847
Grandpa?

292
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:50,961
Stanley.

293
00:28:55,031 --> 00:28:56,233
Hello?

294
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:03,475
Stanley.

295
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Stanley!

296
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:45,282
Stanley.

297
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:04,333
Stanley.

298
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,974
Stanley.

299
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You want me dead!

300
00:31:07,564 --> 00:31:09,334
Whatever.

301
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:14,001
Ridiculous.

302
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:16,705
Oh, freak alert.

303
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:17,609
Hey.

304
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,611
Hey.

305
00:31:21,478 --> 00:31:26,116
Um, so what happened yesterday?

306
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,584
- Did you get into any trouble?
- What?

307
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:31,186
What... What...
What are you talking about?

308
00:31:31,188 --> 00:31:34,626
You know, the fight with Marble.

309
00:31:35,392 --> 00:31:36,525
Yeah. Uh...

310
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:39,227
Roxy, are you serious?
Let's go.

311
00:31:39,229 --> 00:31:42,430
Um, you guys go.
I'll catch you later.

312
00:31:42,432 --> 00:31:44,432
We said we're gonna ditch, so...

313
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:46,301
Okay, so ditch.

314
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:48,439
Fine.

315
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:51,142
What you listening to?

316
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:54,476
Hey, Roxy!

317
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:57,746
Hey, uh, I might need some help
with my homework again.

318
00:31:57,748 --> 00:31:59,581
Think you could, uh...
you can help me out?

319
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:04,621
Just keep your phone on standby.
I'll give you a call.

320
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,631
I know what you're thinking.

321
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,367
What?

322
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:23,238
How could I with... him?

323
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,640
I wasn't gonna say anything.

324
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:28,011
I don't know
what you want me to say.

325
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:31,747
I mean, yeah, it happened.

326
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,614
But I don't...

327
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:36,751
I don't get why it's such a big
deal to everyone, you know?

328
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:39,187
He's a total prick anyways.

329
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:41,092
People judge you here.

330
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:46,460
Not for... who you are,

331
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:49,230
but, like,
who you hang out with.

332
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:51,001
Are you any different?

333
00:32:52,368 --> 00:32:53,768
Maybe.

334
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,603
Like you don't judge people.

335
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:58,440
I mean, judge Marble
and his friends.

336
00:32:58,442 --> 00:33:00,542
That's different.
They're assholes.

337
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:02,044
They weren't always assholes.

338
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,211
They're assholes now.

339
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:06,414
Oh, my God.

340
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,485
You're such a hypocrite.

341
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:12,690
I guess that's just
how it goes around here.

342
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:16,591
You know, if it makes my life
a little easier

343
00:33:16,593 --> 00:33:18,593
to hang out with one crowd
over the other,

344
00:33:18,595 --> 00:33:23,265
then, I mean, I do what I have
to do till I'm out of here.

345
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,236
You think that ends with school?

346
00:33:27,738 --> 00:33:29,606
'Cause that'll go on
the rest of your life.

347
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:32,540
- No.
- Yeah.

348
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,642
Just bouncing from one
phony clique to the other

349
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:36,146
pretending you like people
that you don't.

350
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,716
Ending up like
your shitty parents

351
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:43,818
in some shitty suburban town,

352
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,789
hating your neighbor,
hating your wife.

353
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,724
Hating your parents
for the way you turned out.

354
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:52,393
Please.

355
00:33:52,395 --> 00:33:54,763
Hating your parents
is a rite of passage.

356
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:57,235
We all hate our parents.

357
00:33:58,167 --> 00:33:59,169
Yeah?

358
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,677
I'm... I'm sorry.

359
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,481
Do you want me to go?

360
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,622
No.

361
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:28,231
You're right.

362
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:33,471
I do hate my parents.

363
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,508
I hate them for not being here.

364
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:43,780
I hate them for leaving me.

365
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,487
I'm sorry I-I wasn't there.

366
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:54,222
Do you remember that time I...

367
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:56,224
I tried to run away

368
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:59,396
'cause my stepdad
was hitting my mom again?

369
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:03,534
Um, and you followed me
the whole way.

370
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,400
A-And you didn't try to stop me.

371
00:35:06,402 --> 00:35:08,505
You just...
You just followed me.

372
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:13,340
And... And when I finally asked
you why you were following me,

373
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:17,547
you told me that you didn't
want me to get lost.

374
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,819
You always do the right thing.

375
00:35:28,257 --> 00:35:30,560
Roxy, I have to
tell you something.

376
00:35:32,628 --> 00:35:34,362
My... My grandfather...

377
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:36,666
Hey! There you are.
Where you been all day?

378
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,733
Oh, fuck.
What happened to you, man?

379
00:35:39,735 --> 00:35:41,469
You look like shit.

380
00:35:41,471 --> 00:35:44,574
I mean, more shit than usual,
like if shit took a shit.

381
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:50,644
This is a little awkward.

382
00:35:50,646 --> 00:35:52,646
I'm... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go.

383
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:54,548
Okay.
Um, okay.

384
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,251
I'll see you later.

385
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:57,255
Okay.
Bye.

386
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:01,893
Bye, Roxy.

387
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:03,791
What the hell?

388
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:05,260
- What?
- Seriously.

389
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:06,628
Sorry I interrupted
your tea party.

390
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,697
- What's your problem?
- You're my problem.

391
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:09,965
I'm sorry I scared away
your girlfriend

392
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,800
or not your girlfriend.

393
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,635
You know, I got enough fucking
shit to deal with right now.

394
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:15,673
You seriously had to come up
and do that?

395
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:18,842
I didn't know!

396
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:22,813
Asshole.

397
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,264
Whoo!

398
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,632
Hey, what's the matter?

399
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,467
You and Stanley boy
have a little fight?

400
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,001
Look. Look.
Don't worry.

401
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:50,037
I'm sure you guys will kiss
and make up soon. Relax!

402
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,706
Yeah, they gonna do
a little more than that.

403
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:53,675
Hey, where you going?
We ain't finished talking!

404
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:55,744
What are you doing?

405
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:56,811
What's the matter?

406
00:36:56,813 --> 00:36:58,280
Scared your little boyfriend

407
00:36:58,282 --> 00:36:59,947
isn't gonna be here
to protect you?

408
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:03,517
You know what?
Fuck you guys.

409
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,985
- Oh, we have a tough one.
- Fuck you.

410
00:37:04,987 --> 00:37:06,755
Fuck you.

411
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,659
Fuck me!

412
00:38:37,947 --> 00:38:39,583
Hello?

413
00:38:58,702 --> 00:38:59,870
Hello?

414
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

415
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:21,825
No fucking way.

416
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:33,069
Hey, asshole.

417
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:36,970
Look what they did to me
this time!

418
00:39:36,972 --> 00:39:38,673
You ditched me for Roxy.

419
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:40,541
Those shitheads trampled me
as soon as you left.

420
00:39:40,543 --> 00:39:42,510
I'm so sorry about that,
but you got to fucking leave.

421
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:43,744
I'll explain to you
another time.

422
00:39:43,746 --> 00:39:45,045
No!
What's your damage, man?

423
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:46,481
I'm supposed to be
your best friend!

424
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:48,552
Now tell me what the fuck's
going on!

425
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:54,824
Oh, shit.

426
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:03,534
Okay. Okay.
Come here. Come here.

427
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:19,750
There's something in the shed.

428
00:40:20,784 --> 00:40:23,454
Something dangerous, evil.

429
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,724
It's not human.
It's something else.

430
00:40:30,092 --> 00:40:31,726
It's a murderer.
It killed my dog

431
00:40:31,728 --> 00:40:33,463
and my grandpa the other day.

432
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:38,099
And... And... And then I just,
like, chained the door shut,

433
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:39,534
and now it's trapped
inside, man,

434
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:40,838
and I don't know what to do.

435
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:45,742
I-I-I don't know how
I'm gonna deal with this.

436
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,682
But, Dommer...

437
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,652
...it wants to kill me.

438
00:40:57,253 --> 00:40:59,190
If it gets out,
it's gonna kill me.

439
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:03,724
Are you kidding me?

440
00:41:03,726 --> 00:41:05,059
Are you sniffing glue
or something?

441
00:41:05,061 --> 00:41:06,730
- No. No, no, no.
- Geez.

442
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,134
Dommer, I swear to God
there's something inside.

443
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:12,135
All right.

444
00:41:13,603 --> 00:41:14,771
Then show me.

445
00:41:15,905 --> 00:41:18,241
You want me to believe you,
let me see.

446
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:21,511
Let me see your pet monster.

447
00:41:29,818 --> 00:41:32,523
Okay. Okay.
All right. Fine.

448
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,792
Come on.

449
00:41:41,664 --> 00:41:43,630
Wait. Wait.
Hold on.

450
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:44,898
I-I'm gonna grab something

451
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,070
to patch that hole up
before sunset.

452
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:07,190
Dommer.

453
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:21,605
Dommer.

454
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:34,083
Dommer, you're way
too close, dude.

455
00:42:37,753 --> 00:42:40,723
Dommer.

456
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

457
00:43:07,983 --> 00:43:10,985
Holy shit, man!
That was so rad!

458
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:12,021
God damn!

459
00:43:13,722 --> 00:43:15,123
- Dommer, just chill out.
- Chill out?

460
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,025
Dude, don't you see
what this means?

461
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,126
That I'm dead?

462
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,293
Hell no, man.

463
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:21,195
This is a gift.
We're saved.

464
00:43:21,197 --> 00:43:22,829
What?

465
00:43:22,831 --> 00:43:24,898
Yeah, man, we got a pet monster

466
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,867
like a trained attack dog.

467
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:28,702
We can use this.
This is power.

468
00:43:28,704 --> 00:43:29,771
Are you crazy?

469
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,139
No, dude,

470
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,874
nobody's ever gonna
mess with us again,

471
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,175
not Marble, not nobody.

472
00:43:34,177 --> 00:43:35,677
Think about it.

473
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,179
We get those three dickheads
over here.

474
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:39,713
We send them in one by one.

475
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:41,081
Bam!
Good night, Irene!

476
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,851
Dommer, okay,
listen to me real carefully.

477
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:46,019
You're talking about murder.
Are you out of your mind?

478
00:43:46,021 --> 00:43:47,220
Are you?

479
00:43:47,222 --> 00:43:49,257
It's not murder.
It's payback.

480
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:50,858
Listen to me.

481
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,126
I hate those scumbags,
and I want them dead.

482
00:43:53,128 --> 00:43:54,862
Would you really
feel any remorse

483
00:43:54,864 --> 00:43:56,764
if those three shitheads
fell off the face of the Earth?

484
00:43:56,766 --> 00:43:59,266
- 'Cause I sure as hell wouldn't.
- Listen to me, Dommer.

485
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:02,003
This is not a gift or a weapon.
This is dangerous, all right?

486
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:03,371
I haven't gone to the cops
because I don't want

487
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:04,838
to get dragged
into this whole thing, too.

488
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,708
I'm not going back to juvie,
period!

489
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,842
Look, man, I really think
you're missing the point.

490
00:44:07,844 --> 00:44:08,909
Promise me.

491
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:10,278
Listen to me, you selfish prick!

492
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,479
You ever think about
what it's like for me

493
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:13,146
to get knocked in the dirt
every day

494
00:44:13,148 --> 00:44:16,249
by the same three assholes
year after year, huh?

495
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:17,885
You ever think about
what that's like?

496
00:44:17,887 --> 00:44:19,052
This isn't the solution to that.

497
00:44:19,054 --> 00:44:21,157
Bullshit it's not, man!

498
00:44:23,992 --> 00:44:26,793
Look, Dommer,
I trusted you on this.

499
00:44:26,795 --> 00:44:29,063
I-I told you this fucking secret
as my best friend,

500
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:31,402
and I'm expecting you
to keep it as my best friend.

501
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:34,003
All right?

502
00:44:37,974 --> 00:44:39,209
Please, Dommer.

503
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,715
Please just let me
trust you on this.

504
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,180
Come on, man.
I know I can.

505
00:44:47,182 --> 00:44:49,018
Yeah. Yeah.
You can trust me.

506
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,425
Dommer.

507
00:44:57,193 --> 00:44:59,226
You can trust me.

508
00:44:59,228 --> 00:45:00,431
All right.

509
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:03,867
Okay.

510
00:45:17,813 --> 00:45:19,916
Dommer.

511
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:39,800
<i>We now return to
"Revenge of the Vampire."</i>

512
00:45:39,802 --> 00:45:43,170
<i>You must listen,
my young apprentice.</i>

513
00:45:43,172 --> 00:45:47,374
<i>There are but three ways
to kill the unholy dead.</i>

514
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:49,779
<i>The first is sunlight.</i>

515
00:45:51,547 --> 00:45:54,282
<i>Its fire will burn the beast
to ash.</i>

516
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:56,349
Well, yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

517
00:45:56,351 --> 00:46:01,054
<i>The second way is destroying
its black heart.</i>

518
00:46:01,056 --> 00:46:03,590
<i>The third is decapitation.</i>

519
00:46:03,592 --> 00:46:05,962
<i>These are the only ways.</i>

520
00:46:09,465 --> 00:46:12,102
Good to know, right, ladies?

521
00:46:20,543 --> 00:46:22,546
<i>We must go now quickly.</i>

522
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

523
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

524
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:33,240
Shit.

525
00:48:33,242 --> 00:48:34,976
Ow.

526
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,213
Ow.

527
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:48,488
Oh, shit.

528
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,927
Ow.

529
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,708
Rise and shine, asshole!

530
00:49:53,389 --> 00:49:54,621
You're finished.
You hear me?

531
00:49:54,623 --> 00:49:56,993
This ends today!

532
00:50:42,237 --> 00:50:43,503
Hey.

533
00:50:43,505 --> 00:50:46,206
- Morning, Stanley.
- Morning, Sheriff.

534
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:47,240
Is your grandfather home?

535
00:50:47,242 --> 00:50:48,476
Um, no. No.

536
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,244
He's not here right now.

537
00:50:50,246 --> 00:50:53,746
That's funny 'cause, uh,
the car's still here.

538
00:50:53,748 --> 00:50:55,648
Huh.

539
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:59,686
You don't know where he went or
when he's coming back, do you?

540
00:50:59,688 --> 00:51:01,722
No, I-I don't.
He's...

541
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:04,525
probably out on one of his
drinking binges again, so...

542
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:06,659
he's... he's been gone
a little while.

543
00:51:06,661 --> 00:51:08,595
Can't teach an old dog
new tricks, huh?

544
00:51:08,597 --> 00:51:10,164
No. No, you can't.

545
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:15,436
You know, maybe you could
help me out with something.

546
00:51:15,438 --> 00:51:17,204
Evelyn Bane, she gave me a call.

547
00:51:17,206 --> 00:51:18,771
You know Evelyn Bane, don't you?

548
00:51:18,773 --> 00:51:21,342
No.
I don't know the Banes.

549
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,476
- That's funny.
- Why's that funny?

550
00:51:23,478 --> 00:51:26,479
'Cause they live
right up the road.

551
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:28,481
- Really?
- Her husband, Joe Bane,

552
00:51:28,483 --> 00:51:30,351
they've been getting
all their rabbits killed

553
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,318
on their property.

554
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,155
So he said, "You know what?

555
00:51:35,157 --> 00:51:36,789
I'm gonna go out in the woods
and find them foxes

556
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:38,394
or whatever's doing it."

557
00:51:39,862 --> 00:51:41,364
He never came back.

558
00:51:42,565 --> 00:51:44,197
Huh.

559
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:46,266
Didn't your grandfather
have a little trouble

560
00:51:46,268 --> 00:51:48,471
with Joe Bane
a couple months back?

561
00:51:50,572 --> 00:51:52,606
They... They might have, but I-I
don't really know about that,

562
00:51:52,608 --> 00:51:54,275
'cause, you know, I stay out...

563
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,876
Maybe you could help me out
with something here.

564
00:51:55,878 --> 00:51:57,478
- Well, Sheriff, actually...
- No, no, no, no.

565
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,778
- I really got to get to school.
- No, listen.

566
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,650
It's just gonna take a second.

567
00:52:01,449 --> 00:52:02,816
All right.

568
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:04,952
Do you recognize the guy
in this photo?

569
00:52:04,954 --> 00:52:06,756
Does he look familiar
to you at all?

570
00:52:08,623 --> 00:52:10,292
Um...

571
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:12,661
No.

572
00:52:13,329 --> 00:52:14,795
No?

573
00:52:14,797 --> 00:52:17,865
No. I-I-I've... I've never
seen anyone like that.

574
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:19,569
- Really?
- No.

575
00:52:27,742 --> 00:52:29,378
Could you do me a favor?

576
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,715
If you see anything around here
that kind of...

577
00:52:34,382 --> 00:52:36,983
- ...jumps out at you...
- Mm-hmm.

578
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:39,552
...would you give me a call?

579
00:52:39,554 --> 00:52:41,222
I absolutely will, Sheriff.

580
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:42,325
Of course.

581
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:51,565
Look, uh, Sheriff, I, uh...

582
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:53,499
I really have to get to school.
I'm gonna be really late.

583
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:54,834
- Oh, you got to get to school?
- I'm... I'm gonna be late. Yeah.

584
00:52:54,836 --> 00:52:56,302
Hey, you know what?
I can help you out.

585
00:52:56,304 --> 00:52:58,972
I'm gonna give you a lift
to school.

586
00:52:58,974 --> 00:53:00,407
That way, we can
talk further about this.

587
00:53:00,409 --> 00:53:02,342
No. Sheriff, you don't
have to do that.

588
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:04,847
- I'm sure you got...
- I insist, son.

589
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:10,516
All right, well, I mean, yeah,

590
00:53:10,518 --> 00:53:12,686
that'd be really great,
actually.

591
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:13,753
- Yeah.
- Okay.

592
00:53:13,755 --> 00:53:15,322
Why don't you go get ready?

593
00:53:15,324 --> 00:53:16,927
All right.
I'll go grab my books.

594
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,742
Okay.

595
00:53:52,628 --> 00:53:53,930
Good to go.

596
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:59,932
That's right.
Um, why don't you lead the way?

597
00:53:59,934 --> 00:54:00,971
Sure.

598
00:54:17,552 --> 00:54:20,019
All right, Stan.
It's the end of the line.

599
00:54:20,021 --> 00:54:21,458
What?

600
00:54:23,925 --> 00:54:25,092
We're here.

601
00:54:25,094 --> 00:54:26,592
Oh.

602
00:54:26,594 --> 00:54:28,461
- End of the line.
- Yeah. Right.

603
00:54:28,463 --> 00:54:30,630
- An expression.
- Yeah.

604
00:54:30,632 --> 00:54:32,768
You sure there isn't anything
you want to tell me?

605
00:54:33,835 --> 00:54:34,837
Like what?

606
00:54:35,603 --> 00:54:36,538
I don't know.

607
00:54:38,807 --> 00:54:41,311
Something that's maybe
weighing on your mind.

608
00:54:42,677 --> 00:54:43,943
No.

609
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:45,412
Nothing.

610
00:54:45,414 --> 00:54:46,447
You sure?

611
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,817
Yeah.
I'm sure.

612
00:55:04,766 --> 00:55:06,800
Hey.

613
00:55:06,802 --> 00:55:08,471
Hi.

614
00:55:09,137 --> 00:55:11,738
Hey.
What happened to your face?

615
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,440
Nothing. Nothing.
It's fine.

616
00:55:13,442 --> 00:55:15,577
- Tell me what happened.
- It's okay.

617
00:55:17,112 --> 00:55:19,581
Did you still want
to tell me something?

618
00:55:20,516 --> 00:55:22,416
Roxy, there's a lot
going on right now.

619
00:55:22,418 --> 00:55:24,918
Hey, Roxy, uh, you forgot your
panties at my place last night,

620
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,023
so come by whenever.

621
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:29,055
Screw you.

622
00:55:29,057 --> 00:55:31,728
Oh, no, you did that twice.
Remember?

623
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,961
Fuck off.

624
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:36,130
Calm down, tough guy.
I ain't taking her from you.

625
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:37,597
You can have her.
It's all right.

626
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,733
You just remember one thing,
though.

627
00:55:39,735 --> 00:55:43,036
Uh, you're having
my sloppy seconds.

628
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:52,880
That's enough!
That's enough!

629
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,648
Calm down!
Totally out of control!

630
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:57,985
Calm down.

631
00:55:57,987 --> 00:55:59,653
Just calm down.

632
00:56:00,956 --> 00:56:02,655
Now, listen up.

633
00:56:02,657 --> 00:56:04,590
I've been noticing your
behavior changes recently,

634
00:56:04,592 --> 00:56:07,161
and this is exactly
what I've been afraid of.

635
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:09,099
Help him up.

636
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:12,965
So we've arranged
a little meeting

637
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:14,603
with you and your grandfather.

638
00:56:16,505 --> 00:56:18,972
- What?
- Yeah.

639
00:56:18,974 --> 00:56:21,909
We couldn't reach
your grandfather by telephone,

640
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:25,144
but I just sent Sheriff Dorney
over there to pick him up,

641
00:56:25,146 --> 00:56:27,514
so they're coming back here so
that we can have a little talk

642
00:56:27,516 --> 00:56:28,749
about your possible suspension.

643
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:31,050
Wait. Wait.
Sheriff Dorney's on my...

644
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:32,853
on... on her way
to my house right now?

645
00:56:32,855 --> 00:56:35,425
As we speak.
Shouldn't be long.

646
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:37,893
Stan!

647
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,092
Where you going?

648
00:56:40,094 --> 00:56:41,628
Dommer, they're going
to my house, dude.

649
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:42,699
Who?

650
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:06,055
Marble, hold up, all right?

651
00:58:17,025 --> 00:58:18,193
Ellis, you in there?

652
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,664
Need to talk to you
about something.

653
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:29,068
You're not in trouble
or nothing.

654
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:32,972
It's, uh... It's about Stanley.

655
00:58:32,974 --> 00:58:34,307
And they need to talk to you
about something

656
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:36,012
up at the school.

657
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:50,192
Ellis?

658
00:59:48,817 --> 00:59:50,085
Ellis?

659
00:59:57,992 --> 00:59:59,862
Ellis, that you in there?

660
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Shit!
What the hell?
Hello?
Who's in there?

661
01:00:26,288 --> 01:00:27,954
Help me.

662
01:00:27,956 --> 01:00:30,026
Ellis, I'm gonna get you
out of there, boy.

663
01:00:43,237 --> 01:00:46,775
Ellis, get away from the door!

664
01:00:56,485 --> 01:00:58,251
Wait, wait, wait, wait wait!

665
01:00:58,253 --> 01:00:59,786
Sheriff Dorney, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, Sheriff!

666
01:00:59,788 --> 01:01:01,387
Freeze, Stanley!
Do not move!

667
01:01:01,389 --> 01:01:03,824
- Okay!
- Freeze. Arms in the air!

668
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:04,990
Sheriff, you got to listen
to me real quick.

669
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:06,459
You listen to me, boy.

670
01:01:06,461 --> 01:01:07,927
You are in a shit storm
of trouble.

671
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:09,095
Get down on the ground.

672
01:01:09,097 --> 01:01:10,796
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay.

673
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:12,164
All right, I'll get down,
but, Sheriff,

674
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:13,766
you can't open that door.
We got it boarded for...

675
01:01:13,768 --> 01:01:16,235
You are in no position
to be giving orders.

676
01:01:16,237 --> 01:01:17,903
What the hell is wrong
with you, boy?

677
01:01:17,905 --> 01:01:20,273
You've got your grandpappy
locked in the shed there?

678
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:21,775
No, no.
It's not my grandfather.

679
01:01:21,777 --> 01:01:23,075
- Shut up!
- It's Joe Bane. He killed...

680
01:01:23,077 --> 01:01:25,311
- Hit the dirt!
- Okay.

681
01:01:25,313 --> 01:01:26,979
All right.
I'm down.

682
01:01:26,981 --> 01:01:29,883
If I were you, boy,
I wouldn't be giving orders.

683
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:31,318
- You understand me?
- I understand.

684
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,920
Because the position
you're in right now, boy,

685
01:01:33,922 --> 01:01:36,155
with your goddamn grandfather
in the shed,

686
01:01:36,157 --> 01:01:37,423
you got a shitload of nerve
talking to me

687
01:01:37,425 --> 01:01:39,025
about what I should be doing.

688
01:01:39,027 --> 01:01:41,061
My grandfather's not in
the shed. It's Joe Bane.

689
01:01:41,063 --> 01:01:44,331
You are officially
under my arrest.

690
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,532
- Please, Sheriff.
- Shut the fuck up!

691
01:01:46,534 --> 01:01:49,469
I want you to come out of there
nice and slow, Ellis.

692
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:50,440
Head down.

693
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:53,106
Sheriff.

694
01:01:53,108 --> 01:01:54,374
Come on out, Ellis.

695
01:01:54,376 --> 01:01:55,809
Sheriff, Sheriff,
don't open that...

696
01:01:55,811 --> 01:01:57,811
- Stay down, Stanley.
- Sheriff, no!

697
01:01:57,813 --> 01:02:00,016
Ugh! Aah!

698
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:23,206
Stanley boy!

699
01:02:24,139 --> 01:02:26,338
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

700
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,840
There you are.

701
01:02:27,842 --> 01:02:29,309
Marble,
I can't do this right now.

702
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:32,244
How you doing? Nice little
cheap shot back there.

703
01:02:32,246 --> 01:02:33,479
You got the cops here
to protect you?

704
01:02:33,481 --> 01:02:35,148
No, Marble.
Look, you got to...

705
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:36,516
They can't save your ass anyway.

706
01:02:38,853 --> 01:02:40,253
Look, man, you got to get
out of here right now.

707
01:02:40,255 --> 01:02:43,456
What's up?
Huh?

708
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:46,458
Shit.

709
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:48,997
Get up.
Get up!

710
01:02:50,965 --> 01:02:51,967
Get up!

711
01:02:57,606 --> 01:03:00,139
Whoo!

712
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:01,844
Ain't so tough now, huh?

713
01:03:02,376 --> 01:03:04,610
Marble, you got to leave
right now, man.

714
01:03:04,612 --> 01:03:06,412
I'm telling you.
I got to board up the shed.

715
01:03:06,414 --> 01:03:08,215
Come on.

716
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:10,182
- Get yourself up.
- Look, dude.

717
01:03:10,184 --> 01:03:11,286
Aah!

718
01:03:12,987 --> 01:03:14,256
Whoo!

719
01:03:17,192 --> 01:03:19,391
You know, you were smart
back there, trying to...

720
01:03:19,393 --> 01:03:21,026
Seriously, you don't want...

721
01:03:21,028 --> 01:03:23,630
...trying to show me up
in front of everybody,

722
01:03:23,632 --> 01:03:25,067
but you know what?

723
01:03:27,168 --> 01:03:30,003
I'm, uh...
I think what I'm gonna do

724
01:03:30,005 --> 01:03:33,108
is I'm gonna take my time.

725
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:37,045
I'm gonna beat the shit
out of you.

726
01:03:37,945 --> 01:03:41,049
Put you out of your misery.
Lights out, bitch.

727
01:03:47,389 --> 01:03:49,458
Let him go, you piece of shit.

728
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:56,229
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit, shit.

729
01:03:56,231 --> 01:03:58,164
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

730
01:03:58,166 --> 01:04:00,233
- Yes.
- Yeah, bullshit.

731
01:04:00,235 --> 01:04:01,967
You don't have the balls.

732
01:04:01,969 --> 01:04:03,436
- Oh, shit.
- Okay, okay.

733
01:04:03,438 --> 01:04:05,875
Okay. Okay.

734
01:04:06,474 --> 01:04:07,673
Let him go now.

735
01:04:07,675 --> 01:04:08,641
Okay, calm down.

736
01:04:08,643 --> 01:04:10,378
Stan, get up.

737
01:04:14,449 --> 01:04:17,050
No, look, Dommer.
Just go easy on him.

738
01:04:17,052 --> 01:04:18,184
Fuck easy.

739
01:04:18,186 --> 01:04:19,552
No, no, no.
Don't do this.

740
01:04:19,554 --> 01:04:21,588
Yeah. Hey, you don't
have to do this, man.

741
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:23,155
We were just messing around.

742
01:04:23,157 --> 01:04:25,124
I promise you,
we were just messing around.

743
01:04:25,126 --> 01:04:27,360
You do this, and we're fucked.

744
01:04:27,362 --> 01:04:28,595
Okay?
I'm completely fucked.

745
01:04:28,597 --> 01:04:29,996
Get out of the way, Stan.

746
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:31,164
No, I'm not gonna
get out of your...

747
01:04:31,166 --> 01:04:33,967
Get the fuck out
of the way, Stan!

748
01:04:33,969 --> 01:04:35,302
This asshole's gonna get
what he deserves!

749
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:36,670
Now, whose side are you on,
mine or his?

750
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:39,171
I'm on your side,
but he gets the point, man.

751
01:04:39,173 --> 01:04:41,340
I don't need your help, Stan!

752
01:04:41,342 --> 01:04:43,443
I can handle my own shit!

753
01:04:43,445 --> 01:04:45,144
I can handle my shit!

754
01:04:45,146 --> 01:04:47,182
Now, stop telling me what to do!

755
01:04:49,016 --> 01:04:50,650
Okay.
Please, please, please.

756
01:04:50,652 --> 01:04:52,686
Please, please, please, Dommer.

757
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:54,354
Don't shoot.

758
01:04:54,356 --> 01:04:55,621
I swear to God,
I fucked up, man.

759
01:04:55,623 --> 01:04:56,990
I was just joking, man.

760
01:04:56,992 --> 01:04:58,124
I'm sorry, man.
Cool it. Cool it.

761
01:04:58,126 --> 01:04:59,258
Just take it easy.

762
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,463
Take it easy?

763
01:05:01,295 --> 01:05:03,229
Take it fucking easy?

764
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,298
For years you call me a faggot.

765
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,099
You call me a pussy.

766
01:05:07,101 --> 01:05:11,338
Just yesterday, the three of you
kicked the shit out of me again!

767
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,539
We're not fucking cool, man!

768
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:16,508
It's fucking payback time,
bitch!

769
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:18,744
Who's the pussy now, bitch?!

770
01:05:18,746 --> 01:05:21,347
I am.
I'm the pussy.

771
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:22,749
Please.

772
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:24,586
Get in the shed.

773
01:05:26,221 --> 01:05:27,387
What?

774
01:05:27,389 --> 01:05:28,588
What?

775
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:30,289
Get in there now.

776
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:32,224
- Dommer, don't do this.
- Shut the fuck up!

777
01:05:32,226 --> 01:05:33,559
No, don't put him
in the shed, dude.

778
01:05:33,561 --> 01:05:35,061
Shut the fuck up!

779
01:05:35,063 --> 01:05:36,231
All right.

780
01:05:38,266 --> 01:05:40,733
I get into that fucking shed,
I know you're gonna shoot me.

781
01:05:40,735 --> 01:05:42,501
I'm gonna shoot you
if you don't do what I say.

782
01:05:42,503 --> 01:05:43,536
Now, move.

783
01:05:43,538 --> 01:05:44,706
Okay.

784
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:48,008
God damn it.
All right.

785
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,409
I'm gonna go
inside the fucking...

786
01:05:49,411 --> 01:05:51,610
- Yes, you are.
- Okay.

787
01:05:51,612 --> 01:05:53,246
Just don't shoot.

788
01:05:53,248 --> 01:05:54,481
Come on, Dommer.

789
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:56,952
Oh, shit.
Okay.

790
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,556
Hey, what the fuck is that?

791
01:06:02,289 --> 01:06:03,690
Is that a fucking arm?

792
01:06:03,692 --> 01:06:06,226
- Get in the shed.
- Is that a fucking arm?!

793
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:07,793
Dommer, don't put him
in the fucking shed.

794
01:06:07,795 --> 01:06:09,229
Shut the fuck up, Stan.

795
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:11,164
Dude, let's just let him
go home, man.

796
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:12,499
Shut the fuck up!

797
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:13,733
Dommer,
don't make him go in there.

798
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:15,334
- You're gonna...
- I'm gonna fucking

799
01:06:15,336 --> 01:06:16,336
shoot you, too!

800
01:06:16,338 --> 01:06:17,470
Shut up!

801
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:19,671
Say one more fucking thing!

802
01:06:19,673 --> 01:06:21,074
Look, I'm a pussy, man.
I'm a pussy.

803
01:06:21,076 --> 01:06:22,508
Yes, you fucking are.

804
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:23,776
Now, get the fuck in there

805
01:06:23,778 --> 01:06:26,112
before I blow
your fucking face off.

806
01:06:26,114 --> 01:06:27,780
I am not fucking with you!

807
01:06:27,782 --> 01:06:29,416
Dommer, what's inside that shed?

808
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:30,586
Get in.

809
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:33,586
What the fuck's
inside that shed?!

810
01:06:33,588 --> 01:06:35,358
You want to get shot?

811
01:06:36,657 --> 01:06:38,191
Go inside.

812
01:06:38,193 --> 01:06:40,260
Dommer, please.

813
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:42,595
Please, I'm begging you.

814
01:06:42,597 --> 01:06:44,567
Beg better, bitch.

815
01:06:47,101 --> 01:06:48,101
I'm a fucking pussy.

816
01:06:48,103 --> 01:06:49,305
Beg better!

817
01:06:51,206 --> 01:06:53,072
Please, please.

818
01:06:53,074 --> 01:06:54,441
- I don't believe you.
- I fucking...

819
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:56,075
Everything I did to you, man,

820
01:06:56,077 --> 01:06:58,144
I was a piece of shit
for doing it.

821
01:06:58,146 --> 01:07:01,748
Everything, everything from
Roxy, with Stan, with you, man.

822
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,349
Every time, I fucked up.
I fucked up.

823
01:07:03,351 --> 01:07:04,784
And... And it's...
it's all on me.

824
01:07:04,786 --> 01:07:06,485
Okay?
It's all on me.

825
01:07:06,487 --> 01:07:07,756
I forgive you.

826
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,157
Get in there.

827
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:14,360
Go!

828
01:07:14,362 --> 01:07:16,329
Three... two.

829
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:17,432
Okay, I'm going.

830
01:07:27,141 --> 01:07:28,441
Maybe...
Maybe it's not too late.

831
01:07:28,443 --> 01:07:29,675
Maybe we can get him out.

832
01:07:29,677 --> 01:07:31,279
It was too late a long time ago,
Stan.

833
01:07:32,414 --> 01:07:33,780
The hell's that?
Fuck.

834
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:46,358
What the fuck did you just do?
What the hell were you thinking?

835
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,193
- Enough was enough, all right?
- You just got him killed.

836
01:07:48,195 --> 01:07:49,795
You just fucking
killed him, man.

837
01:07:49,797 --> 01:07:51,331
- You killed Marble!
- Get your hands off of me!

838
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,831
You fucking killed him, dude!

839
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:54,867
- Killed him, dude!
- Pussy! You're a fucking coward!

840
01:07:54,869 --> 01:07:56,105
And I'd...

841
01:08:07,481 --> 01:08:08,817
Stanley?

842
01:08:09,617 --> 01:08:11,320
Stan, are you okay?

843
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:19,259
Roxy?

844
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,460
What happened?

845
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:22,195
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

846
01:08:22,197 --> 01:08:23,662
Where is he?
Did he get out?

847
01:08:23,664 --> 01:08:24,667
Who?

848
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:27,403
Ah, shit.

849
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:30,736
Roxy, where's Dommer?

850
01:08:30,738 --> 01:08:32,205
- Dommer?
- Where'd he go?

851
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:33,876
No one is here.
No one is here.

852
01:08:55,796 --> 01:08:57,729
Did anyone come out of here?

853
01:08:57,731 --> 01:09:00,168
Who?
Who are you looking for?

854
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,472
Stan, what the hell
is happening?

855
01:09:10,945 --> 01:09:13,314
Oh, my God! What?!

856
01:09:14,582 --> 01:09:16,516
Okay, okay, Roxy?

857
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:18,518
Roxy, Roxy, it's okay.
It's okay.

858
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,357
Hey, I-I need you
to stay right there, okay?

859
01:09:22,356 --> 01:09:23,525
Stay there.

860
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:04,760
Marble?

861
01:11:06,493 --> 01:11:07,595
Marble?

862
01:11:14,868 --> 01:11:15,970
Wait.

863
01:11:21,475 --> 01:11:22,478
Marble?

864
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,351
Marble, is that you?

865
01:11:31,485 --> 01:11:32,820
Marble, where's Bane?

866
01:11:38,626 --> 01:11:39,862
Bane, drop him.

867
01:11:43,364 --> 01:11:44,500
Dommer?

868
01:11:48,936 --> 01:11:52,041
I wish you could see the look
on your face.

869
01:11:55,009 --> 01:11:57,442
Dommer, where's Bane?

870
01:11:57,444 --> 01:11:59,812
Gone, but he's
coming back for you.

871
01:11:59,814 --> 01:12:02,048
You know, Stan?

872
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:03,715
I always thought that...

873
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:08,388
...that you were the strong one,

874
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,994
but not anymore.

875
01:12:12,926 --> 01:12:15,428
I'm the strong one now.

876
01:12:18,565 --> 01:12:20,435
Dommer, please don't do this.

877
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:22,835
You're my friend.

878
01:12:22,837 --> 01:12:24,840
You're my best friend.

879
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,377
We're not just friends, Stan.

880
01:12:30,878 --> 01:12:35,016
We're blood brothers forever.

881
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:42,124
Roxy, run right now!

882
01:12:55,569 --> 01:12:57,706
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

883
01:13:01,576 --> 01:13:02,607
Dommer?

884
01:13:02,609 --> 01:13:03,778
Dommer?

885
01:14:03,136 --> 01:14:05,206
What the hell is going on?

886
01:14:06,073 --> 01:14:08,009
What happened to Dommer?

887
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
I'm sorry.

888
01:14:16,184 --> 01:14:20,218
Stan, I'm sorry.

889
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,522
Stan!

890
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,059
I'm sorry.

891
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:51,186
What the hell is happening?

892
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:56,656
Stan?
Look at me.

893
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:57,857
Tell me what's going on.

894
01:14:57,859 --> 01:14:59,724
Okay, okay.

895
01:14:59,726 --> 01:15:02,264
I-I'll tell you everything,
but you have to help me, Roxy.

896
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:05,734
Okay.

897
01:15:13,707 --> 01:15:15,743
We don't have much time.

898
01:17:10,358 --> 01:17:12,260
All of this is my fault.

899
01:17:15,363 --> 01:17:16,865
My grandfather was right.

900
01:17:17,965 --> 01:17:19,266
That's not true.

901
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,139
Hey, none of this is your fault.

902
01:17:26,774 --> 01:17:29,177
I thought I could handle this
on my own.

903
01:17:32,046 --> 01:17:33,815
I thought I could handle Dommer.

904
01:17:37,051 --> 01:17:40,352
I mean, I knew
what he was going to do,

905
01:17:40,354 --> 01:17:43,158
but a part of me just didn't
think he would actually do it.

906
01:17:44,725 --> 01:17:47,395
I don't know.
Maybe part of me wanted him to.

907
01:17:50,097 --> 01:17:52,798
I'm so sorry
I got you into this.

908
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,200
No, no.

909
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:55,904
No, I can't lose you.

910
01:17:58,472 --> 01:18:00,805
I really think you should go
before the sun sets.

911
01:18:00,807 --> 01:18:02,344
- Just...
- Before he comes.

912
01:18:04,377 --> 01:18:08,182
It's not your job to always
look out for everyone else.

913
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:11,787
There is no one else.
It's just you.

914
01:18:12,753 --> 01:18:15,756
Then it's not your job
to look out for <i>me.</i>

915
01:18:17,457 --> 01:18:19,791
- Stan.
- Yeah.

916
01:18:19,793 --> 01:18:21,063
Look at me.

917
01:18:27,234 --> 01:18:29,270
You're bleeding again.

918
01:18:31,471 --> 01:18:34,139
Happens a lot.

919
01:19:00,534 --> 01:19:02,269
I think you're okay.

920
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,848
It's nighttime.

921
01:19:15,582 --> 01:19:17,950
No more hiding.

922
01:19:17,952 --> 01:19:19,887
No more hiding.

923
01:19:20,488 --> 01:19:22,190
Tonight he dies.

924
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:37,836
Stan!

925
01:19:37,838 --> 01:19:39,274
Come out here, you pussy.

926
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,243
What the hell?

927
01:19:45,011 --> 01:19:46,411
Shit!

928
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:48,280
We have to get them out of here.

929
01:19:48,282 --> 01:19:50,148
Don't say anything,
and maybe they'll leave.

930
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:52,218
We know you're here.

931
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,288
Where's Marble?

932
01:19:55,055 --> 01:19:58,190
Okay, look, Marble's not here.
You have to go right now, Pitt.

933
01:19:58,192 --> 01:19:59,892
We saw his car out back.

934
01:19:59,894 --> 01:20:02,594
Dude, if you stay here,
you are in serious danger.

935
01:20:02,596 --> 01:20:04,095
I'm telling you,
you have to go right now.

936
01:20:04,097 --> 01:20:05,531
Are you threatening us?

937
01:20:05,533 --> 01:20:07,599
I think you're the one
in serious danger here.

938
01:20:07,601 --> 01:20:09,235
Where is Marble?

939
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:10,902
- He's not here, dude.
- Bullshit!

940
01:20:10,904 --> 01:20:12,271
We know he was coming here
to kick your ass!

941
01:20:12,273 --> 01:20:13,438
He would never leave
his car behind.

942
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,139
That car is his life.

943
01:20:15,141 --> 01:20:17,476
Look, guys, I'm telling you,
you need to leave now.

944
01:20:17,478 --> 01:20:19,344
Oh, look who else is here.
What a surprise.

945
01:20:19,346 --> 01:20:21,146
Hey, let's go.

946
01:20:21,148 --> 01:20:24,148
Look, we ain't going nowhere
till I find out where Marble is.

947
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:26,117
We got to get out of here, man.
I don't like this.

948
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:28,419
There's something up here.
Let's go.

949
01:20:28,421 --> 01:20:29,888
Look, you have to go
before it's too late.

950
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:31,190
I'm telling you.

951
01:20:31,192 --> 01:20:33,558
No, no, no.
It's too late for <i>you.</i>

952
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,027
You've got five seconds
to tell me where Marble is,

953
01:20:36,029 --> 01:20:38,030
or I'm kicking this door in.

954
01:20:38,032 --> 01:20:39,098
One.

955
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,665
I'm serious, man.
Let's go.

956
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:42,468
- Leave now!
- Two.

957
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:45,504
I mean it, man.
I don't like this. Let's go.

958
01:20:45,506 --> 01:20:47,373
- Three.
- Pitt, just go.

959
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:49,241
- Four.
- Okay, fuck this. I'm going.

960
01:20:49,243 --> 01:20:50,476
- You can stay.
- Five.

961
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, shit!

962
01:20:59,052 --> 01:21:00,451
Let me in!
Let me in!

963
01:21:00,453 --> 01:21:02,388
- Please, please!
- What do I do?

964
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:04,555
Okay, uh, let him in.
Just let him in.

965
01:21:04,557 --> 01:21:06,191
Fine, fine, fine,
fine, fine, fine, fine.

966
01:21:06,193 --> 01:21:07,692
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh.

967
01:21:07,694 --> 01:21:09,193
- Oh, shit. No, get up, get up!
- Get the door.

968
01:21:09,195 --> 01:21:11,296
- Stan, I got...
- What was that?

969
01:21:11,298 --> 01:21:13,598
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay. Okay.

970
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,634
What the hell is going on here?!
What the fuck was that?!

971
01:21:15,636 --> 01:21:16,968
- Where the fuck is Marble?!
- Calm down, okay?

972
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:19,638
- Stop screaming.
- I-I-I can't die.

973
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,440
- I don't want to die.
- Shut up. Shut up. Hey.

974
01:21:21,442 --> 01:21:23,442
Marble is dead, all right?

975
01:21:23,444 --> 01:21:25,410
And if you don't shut up
and get your shit together,

976
01:21:25,412 --> 01:21:26,447
you're gonna be dead, too.

977
01:21:28,082 --> 01:21:31,152
You didn't kill him, did you?

978
01:21:35,722 --> 01:21:37,656
- Oh, no.
- What the fuck?

979
01:21:37,658 --> 01:21:39,223
He's here.

980
01:21:39,225 --> 01:21:40,558
He?

981
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,994
Come on. Come on.

982
01:21:41,996 --> 01:21:43,195
What?

983
01:21:43,197 --> 01:21:45,964
Wait, he?
Who... Who's here?

984
01:21:45,966 --> 01:21:47,700
We should be safe inside.

985
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:49,168
We boarded up this place
really good.

986
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,269
- How good?
- Real good.

987
01:21:51,271 --> 01:21:53,438
We boarded up all the windows
upstairs and down here, too.

988
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,107
- Lock the front and back doors?
- Basement and hatch.

989
01:21:56,109 --> 01:21:56,944
You got the attic?

990
01:21:58,179 --> 01:21:59,480
Attic?

991
01:22:01,114 --> 01:22:02,613
Oh, no, please tell me
you got the attic.

992
01:22:02,615 --> 01:22:04,482
You didn't tell me
there was an attic.

993
01:22:04,484 --> 01:22:06,151
You guys.

994
01:22:06,153 --> 01:22:08,187
- You said you got upstairs.
- I did do upstairs.

995
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,187
Well, upstairs
includes the attic.

996
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:10,188
You guys!

997
01:22:20,734 --> 01:22:22,269
What the fuck?

998
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:25,137
Okay, let's go.

999
01:22:25,139 --> 01:22:26,338
Go?
Up there?

1000
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,638
Yeah.

1001
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,209
Look, maybe I should
keep lookout.

1002
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:32,010
I'll stay down here,
back you guys up from here.

1003
01:22:32,012 --> 01:22:34,146
Yeah, okay, good idea.

1004
01:22:34,148 --> 01:22:36,650
Stay down here... alone.

1005
01:22:40,354 --> 01:22:42,090
Shit.

1006
01:23:17,123 --> 01:23:18,225
Okay.

1007
01:23:20,427 --> 01:23:22,561
There's three ways
to kill him...

1008
01:23:22,563 --> 01:23:25,696
sunlight, destroy his heart...

1009
01:23:25,698 --> 01:23:27,601
Yeah, and?

1010
01:23:29,203 --> 01:23:30,369
You chop off his head.

1011
01:23:30,371 --> 01:23:31,836
Chop his head off?

1012
01:23:31,838 --> 01:23:32,707
Yeah.

1013
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:38,110
Okay, now, there's three of us.
There's three rooms.

1014
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:40,414
We each take a room, and then
we go up the attic together.

1015
01:23:42,483 --> 01:23:43,848
If you see him, yell.

1016
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,817
That's your plan, yell?

1017
01:23:45,819 --> 01:23:47,553
Shut up.

1018
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:50,089
Oh, we're so dead.

1019
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:51,459
Let's go.

1020
01:24:05,773 --> 01:24:06,608
Go.

1021
01:24:09,342 --> 01:24:10,711
Now, Pitt.

1022
01:24:25,259 --> 01:24:26,795
One.

1023
01:24:31,564 --> 01:24:32,500
Two.

1024
01:24:36,203 --> 01:24:37,305
Three.

1025
01:25:33,327 --> 01:25:35,360
You guys?

1026
01:25:35,362 --> 01:25:36,463
Guys?

1027
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1028
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1029
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Roxy?

1030
01:29:21,521 --> 01:29:22,888
Roxy!

1031
01:29:24,725 --> 01:29:26,794
No!

1032
01:29:31,832 --> 01:29:33,101
Bane!

1033
01:29:34,768 --> 01:29:37,404
Let her go!

1034
01:29:41,108 --> 01:29:43,378
Yeah.

1035
01:30:00,694 --> 01:30:01,629
Ah!

1036
01:30:17,243 --> 01:30:18,643
I'm gonna kill you.

1037
01:30:18,645 --> 01:30:20,544
Wrong again.

1038
01:30:20,546 --> 01:30:21,646
<i>You</i> die!

1039
01:30:21,648 --> 01:30:23,117
Not tonight, asshole.

1040
01:30:38,097 --> 01:30:39,763
No. No.

1041
01:30:59,051 --> 01:31:00,121
No!

1042
01:31:01,555 --> 01:31:03,758
<i>You</i> die, asshole.

1043
01:31:04,725 --> 01:31:05,690
Die!

1044
01:31:08,828 --> 01:31:09,729
Roxy?

1045
01:31:11,064 --> 01:31:11,833
Roxy?

1046
01:31:24,744 --> 01:31:26,546
Heads up, motherfucker.

1047
01:33:26,365 --> 01:33:28,933
It'll be dark again soon.

1048
01:33:28,935 --> 01:33:30,000
You locked the trunk, right?

1049
01:33:30,002 --> 01:33:31,169
I thought you did.

1050
