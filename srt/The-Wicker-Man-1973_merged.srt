1
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,229
That which also I delivered onto you.

2
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,633
The Lord Jesus, the same night
in which he was betrayed, took bread,

3
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,229
and when he had given thanks,

4
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,751
he broke it and said,

5
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,236
"Take. Eat.

6
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,153
"This is my body,

7
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,152
"which is broken for you,

8
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,474
"this do in remembrance of me."

9
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,792
And after the same manner
he also took the cup

10
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,797
when he had eaten, saying,

11
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,190
"This cup is the new covenant
in my blood.

12
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,551
"This, oft as you drink it,
in remembrance of me,

13
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,149
"or as often as you eat this bread

14
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,272
"and drink this wine,

15
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,279
"you do shew the Lord's death

16
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,152
"till he comes again."

17
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,519
Will you send a dinghy, please?

18
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,311
'Did you hear me?
I'd like a dinghy, if you please.'

19
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,558
Hello, sir!
Have you lost your bearings?

20
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,956
'No, sir, I don't think so.

21
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,869
- 'This is Summerisle, is it not?'
- It is, sir!

22
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,913
'I'm right then.
Now, would you send a dinghy, please?'

23
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,796
I'm afraid it can't be done, sir!
This is private property!

24
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,754
You can't land here
without written permission!

25
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,672
'I, as you can see, am a police officer.

26
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,911
'A complaint has been registered

27
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,317
'by a resident of this island
about a missing child.

28
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,354
'Now, that makes it a police matter,
private property or not.

29
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,949
'Now, will you send a dinghy, please?'

30
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,037
Need to tell his lordship, aye.

31
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,313
Good day to you, sir.
I'm the harbour master.

32
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,630
Sergeant Howie, West Highland police.

33
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,274
A missing child is always trouble.

34
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,358
Aye, aye, aye, for everybody.

35
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,632
Perhaps you would be good enough
to explain matters to his lordship.

36
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,956
He's most particular who lands here.

37
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,750
All in good time.
We, too, have our own particularities.

38
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,077
You know her?
Her name is Rowan Morrison.

39
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,029
The photo was in this letter,
posted here on Summerisle.

40
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,515
No, no, never seen her before.

41
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,996
I don't know the face either.
Do you know her, Kenny?

42
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,396
She doesn't belong to this island.

43
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,909
No, I never saw her before.

44
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,158
No, she doesn't belong here at all.
Johnnie?

45
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,112
The letter is anonymous.

46
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,596
It was addressed to me personally
on the mainland.

47
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,075
No, cannae say I know her.

48
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,194
Now, now, what are you saying?
You're saying she's not from the island?

49
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,391
That's right. She's not from here.

50
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,150
You get Morrisons on Lewis
and a few on Mull. I would try there.

51
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,714
Thanks.

52
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,117
"None of us has seen May Morrison's
daughter Rowan since last year.

53
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,359
"She's only 12, and she's been missing
from her home for many months."

54
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,471
The mother's name is May Morrison.

55
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,355
Oh, May!
She quite slipped my memory.

56
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,871
Of course we've got May. She keeps
the post office in the high street.

57
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,038
- May Morrison? You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.

58
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,549
Well, thank you for your help.

59
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,918
That's not May's daughter, though!

60
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,235
No, she's not May's.

61
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,476
Then who is she?

62
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,999
- Good afternoon.
- I like your rabbits.

63
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,192
Those are hares,
not silly old rabbits.

64
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,473
Lovely March hares.
Can I help you?

65
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,830
- Mrs Morrison? Mrs May Morrison?
- Yes.

66
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,794
- Sergeant Howie, West Highland police.
- Oh, my!

67
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,072
Did you come over in that aeroplane
that I saw flying round?

68
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,596
- Aye, that's right.
- What, just to see me?

69
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,633
Well, no, not exactly. Erm...

70
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,640
I'm making inquiries about your daughter.
We understand that she's missing.

71
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,876
Missing? My daughter?

72
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,352
- Aye. You do have a daughter?
- Yes.

73
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,997
- And that's her?
- Oh, never.

74
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,596
I tell you no.

75
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,749
I think you'd better come with me.

76
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,193
This is our Myrtle.
She was nine last Thursday.

77
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,954
She's not a bit like the girl
in your photograph.

78
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,959
She must be
at least 13 or 14, surely.

79
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,469
Myrtle, say hello.

80
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,069
- This is Sergeant... Oh!
- Howie.

81
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,077
- Oh.
- Hello, Myrtle.

82
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,759
How do you do?

83
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,753
- Look, Mummy, I'm drawing a hare.
- Ah.

84
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,110
Excuse me, Sergeant.

85
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,793
Hello.

86
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,757
Here you are,
you can fill in the ears in grey.

87
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,279
Oh, sorry.

88
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,031
Thank you, Myrtle.

89
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,717
Myrtle, do you, erm...
do you know Rowan?

90
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,672
Course I do.

91
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,477
- You do?
- Course I do, silly.

92
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,151
- Uh, do you know where she is now?
- In the fields.

93
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,351
She runs and plays there all day.

94
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,393
Does she? Do you think
she'll be coming back for tea?

95
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,712
Tea? Hares don't have tea, silly.

96
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,273
Hares?

97
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,593
She's a hare. Rowan's a hare.
She has a lovely time.

98
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,151
- Well, tell me...
- Well, now, Sergeant.

99
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,999
You will stay and have a cup of tea,
won't you?

100
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,754
- Oh, well, yes, yes, please.
- Good.

101
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,632
- That's very kind of you.
- Not at all.

102
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,229
It must be thirsty work,
asking all those questions, eh?

103
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,589
Aye.

104
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,791
- Hello. Evening.
- Evening.

105
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,715
- Evening.
- Hello again.

106
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,915
- Are you the landlord here?
- Aye. I'm Alder MacGreagor.

107
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,509
And you must be the policeman
from the mainland.

108
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,393
Aye, that's right. Sergeant Howie,
West Highland constabulary.

109
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,478
I'm quite obviously not going
to get back to the mainland tonight,

110
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,830
so I wondered if you had a room
and a bite of supper I could have.

111
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,118
- Could you manage that?
- Aye, I think that can be arranged.

112
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,471
My daughter Willow will show you
to your room.

113
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,070
- Willow!
- Father?

114
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,716
This is Sergeant Howie,
a policeman from the mainland,

115
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,116
who will be spending the night with us.

116
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,199
- This is my daughter, Willow.
- Good evening.

117
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,311
Show the Sergeant to his room,
would you?

118
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,912
- I'd like my supper now, please.
- It won't be long, Sergeant.

119
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,554
Och, you don't want to let them
worry you.

120
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,830
Why don't you have a wee drink?

121
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,236
No, thank you, not just now.

122
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,431
I think you all ought to know that
I am here on official business.

123
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,913
I am here to investigate
the disappearance of a young girl...

124
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,919
...as doubtless, the harbour master
has already told you by now.

125
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,999
There's the girl.
Her name is Rowan Morrison.

126
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,795
Would you pass that
among your customers, please?

127
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,276
Now, if any of you can give me
any idea as to her whereabouts,

128
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,153
I'd be most grateful
if you'd let me know.

129
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,559
No, I've not seen her.
Have you tried the mainland?

130
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,151
No, I've not see her.
I've not seen her at all.

131
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,592
No, I'm afraid
nobody's seen her, Sergeant.

132
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,556
Thank you. Are these
harvest festival photographs?

133
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,069
Aye, we have one taken
at the end of every summer.

134
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,034
- What happened to last year's?
- It got broke.

135
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,276
Your supper's ready, Sergeant.

136
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,040
Willow, show the Sergeant
to the dining room.

137
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,113
Thank you.

138
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,399
It's disgusting.

139
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,270
- Thank you.
- What's the matter, aren't you hungry?

140
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,311
Aye, it's just most of the food I've had,

141
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,514
the farmhouse soup, the potatoes,
broad beans, all come out of a can.

142
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,550
Broad beans, in their natural state,
aren't usually turquoise, are they?

143
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,833
Some things in their natural state
have the most vivid colours.

144
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,874
I-I-l... just wanted to know why,
that's all.

145
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,277
Now, I wonder what
you'll be wanting for afters?

146
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,472
- I'll have an apple.
- No apples.

147
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,475
No apples? On an island famous
for its fruit and vegetables?

148
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,989
I expect they've all been exported.

149
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,475
You can have peaches and cream,
if you like.

150
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,319
Aye, from a can, I suppose.

151
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,113
All right.

152
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,470
Cheer up.
Food isn't everything in life, you know.

153
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,956
Up, up,	up,

154
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,277
up, up, up! Up! Up!

155
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,075
Where?

156
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,511
You'll find it at the top of the stair
on your right.

157
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,513
Willow MacGreagor, I have the honour
to present to you Ash Buchanan.

158
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,629
Come up, Ash Buchanan.

159
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,471
Another sacrifice for Aphrodite, Willow.

160
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,750
You flatter me, your lordship.

161
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,269
Surely you mean to Aphrodite?

162
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,549
I make no such distinction.

163
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,240
You are the Goddess of Love
in human form

164
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,873
and I am merely your humble acolyte.

165
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,719
Enjoy yourself... and him.

166
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,912
Only, make sure you are ready
for tomorrow's tomorrow.

167
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,635
The day of
death and rebirth.

168
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,510
Yes.

169
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,395
And of a somewhat more
serious offering.

170
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,473
I think I could turn
and live with animals.

171
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,718
They are so placid and self-contained.

172
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,833
They do not lie awake in the dark
and weep for their sins.

173
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,670
They do not make me sick,
discussing their duty to God.

174
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,710
Not one of them kneels to another,

175
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,071
or to his own kind
that lived thousands of years ago.

176
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,833
Not one of them is 'respectable'...

177
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,600
or 'unhappy'...

178
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,040
all over the earth.

179
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,432
Good morning, Sergeant.

180
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,552
- Morning.
- Isn't it glorious?

181
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,796
Aye, aye, it's very nice.

182
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,434
I expect you'll be going home tonight?

183
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,513
Well, that depends.

184
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,877
Where's the school, please?

185
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,310
On the far side of the green.

186
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,556
Thank you.

187
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,990
Very well, girls. That's enough.
Now it's time to pay attention to me.

188
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,358
Now, uh, Daisy,

189
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,951
will you tell us what it is, please,
that the Maypole represents?

190
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,634
Really, Daisy.
You've been told often enough.

191
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,434
- Miss Rose, I know!
- I know!

192
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,200
- All right, then, anybody.
- Phallic symbol.

193
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,399
The phallic symbol.
That is correct.

194
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,796
It is the image of the penis,

195
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,072
which is venerated in religions
such as ours

196
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,591
as symbolising
the generative force in nature.

197
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,910
Oh, can I help you?

198
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,960
C-could I have a word with you,
please, Miss?

199
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,233
Certainly. Girls, open your desks
and take out your exercise books.

200
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,917
Miss, you can be quite sure that I shall
report this to the proper authorities.

201
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,554
Everywhere I go on this island,
it seems to me I find degeneracy.

202
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,072
And there is brawling in bars,
there is indecency in public places,

203
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,113
and there is corruption of the young,
and now I see it all stems from here.

204
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,635
It stems from the filth taught here
in this very schoolroom.

205
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,879
I was unaware that the police had
any authority in matters of education.

206
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,470
Aye, aye, well,
we'll see about that.

207
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,275
Girls, could I have your attention,
please?

208
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,073
Now, I am a police officer.

209
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,437
Well, as you can see.

210
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,949
I have come here from the mainland

211
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,835
to investigate
the disappearance of a young girl.

212
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,554
I have a photograph here...
Excuse me.

213
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,913
...which I would like you
to pass around amongst yourselves.

214
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,874
Meanwhile, I'll write her name over there
on the blackboard.

215
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,957
Rowan Morrison.

216
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,357
That's her name.

217
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,070
Now, do any of you recognise
either the name or the photograph?

218
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,840
- No.
- There's your answer, Sergeant.

219
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,157
If she existed, we would know her.

220
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,160
- Whose desk is that?
- No one's.

221
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,874
Thank you.

222
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,034
The little old beetle goes round and
round, always the same way, you see,

223
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,199
till he ends up right up tight
to the nail, poor old thing.

224
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,713
"Poor old thing"?

225
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,510
Then why in God's name
do you do it, girl?

226
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,078
I'd like to see the school register,
please.

227
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,840
I'm afraid you'll have to have
Lord Summerisle's authority.

228
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,712
This is a police matter.

229
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,070
I'm afraid you'll have to have
a search warrant or permission

230
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,714
from Lord Summerisle himself.

231
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,878
I'm afraid you'll just have
to bear with me, won't you?

232
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,075
You're liars.
You are despicable little liars.

233
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,080
Rowan Morrison is
a schoolmate of yours, isn't she?

234
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,715
And that is her desk, isn't it?

235
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,400
- Well, isn't it?
- I think you ought to know...

236
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,029
And you are the biggest liar of all!

237
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,754
I warn you,
one more lie out of you,

238
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,589
and I will charge you with obstruction.

239
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,553
And, believe me, Miss Rose,
that is a promise.

240
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,239
Now...

241
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,152
...for the last time,

242
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,999
where is Rowan Morrison?

243
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,191
I would like to speak
to you outside, Sergeant.

244
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,470
Girls, get on with your reading.

245
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,197
It's the "Rites and Rituals of May Day",
chapter five. I won't be long.

246
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,039
Well?

247
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,474
You don't understand, Sergeant.
Nobody was lying. I told you plainly.

248
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,797
If Rowan Morrison existed,
we would know of her.

249
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,390
You mean, she doesn't exist?
She's dead?

250
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,637
- You would say so.
- Oh, come on, come on.

251
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,354
She's either dead, or she's not dead.

252
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,677
Here, we do not use the word...

253
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,872
We believe that
when the human life is over,

254
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,880
the soul returns to trees, to air,

255
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,038
to fire, to water, to animals.

256
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,513
So that Rowan Morrison
has simply returned

257
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,149
to the life forces in another form.

258
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,513
Do you mean to say
you teach the children this stuff?

259
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,840
Yes. I told you,
it is what we believe.

260
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,395
They never learn anything
of Christianity?

261
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,194
Only as a comparative religion.

262
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,199
The children find it
far easier to picture

263
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,199
reincarnation than resurrection.

264
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,718
Those rotting bodies
are a great stumbling block

265
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,514
for the childish imagination.

266
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,119
Why, of course.

267
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,072
And may I ask,

268
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,158
where is the rotting body
of Rowan Morrison?

269
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,432
Right where you'd expect it to be,
in the earth.

270
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,030
You mean, in the churchyard?

271
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,949
- In a manner of speaking...
- No! In plain speaking.

272
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,870
The building attached to the ground
in which the body lies

273
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,152
is no longer used
for Christian worship,

274
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,279
so whether it is still a churchyard
is debatable.

275
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,313
But forgive me. I must get back
to my girls. Good morning to you.

276
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,513
"Here lieth Beech Buchanan,

277
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,599
"protected by
the ejaculation of serpents"?

278
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,071
- Morning.
- Morning.

279
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,079
I see you plant trees
on most of the graves here.

280
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,716
- Aye, that's right.
- What tree is that?

281
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,036
That's a rowan.

282
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,629
- And who lies there?
- Rowan Morrison.

283
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,437
- How long has she been dead?
- Oh, six or seven months.

284
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,951
They're just a wee bit late
with the headstone.

285
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,350
What on earth's that?
It looks like a piece of skin.

286
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,598
- Why, so it is.
- Well, what is it?

287
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,037
The poor wee lassie's navel string,
of course.

288
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,472
Where else should it be
but hung on her own little tree?

289
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,110
Where does your minister live?

290
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,799
Minister?

291
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,118
"Minister"!

292
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,077
What a silly girl you are to make
all this fuss. It's just a little frog.

293
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,517
It'll do that poor sore throat good.

294
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,631
Anyone'd think you didn't
want to get better.

295
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,229
Now, in he goes!

296
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,517
And out he comes. There.
Now, that didn't hurt much, did it?

297
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,712
- It tasted horrid.
- Never mind, darling. It's all over now.

298
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,310
Here's your sweet for being a brave girl.
Which one would you like?

299
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,719
There. He's got your horrid old sore
throat now, hasn't he, poor creature?

300
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,797
Can't you hear him croaking?

301
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,395
Can I do anything for you, Sergeant?

302
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,115
I doubt it,
seeing you're all raving mad.

303
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,477
Good day.

304
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,433
I'd like to see
your index of deaths, please.

305
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,597
Do you have authority?

306
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,069
No, I meant from his lordship.

307
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,395
I don't need it.

308
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,235
I'm afraid you have to get permission
from Lord Summerisle.

309
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,471
Miss...

310
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,797
If you don't cooperate with me
here and now,

311
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,879
you may well find yourself inside
a police cell on the mainland tonight!

312
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,798
Have I made myself quite clear?

313
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,637
Please.

314
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,233
Thank you.

315
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,510
M, M, M, M...

316
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,593
"Benjamin and Rachel Morrison."

317
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,791
Rachel and Benjamin...

318
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,830
- Names from the Bible.
- Yes. They were very old.

319
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,150
But there's no record
of Rowan Morrison's death,

320
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,438
which means, of course,
there is no death certificate.

321
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,678
- Did you know her?
- Yes, of course.

322
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,434
- Is that her?
- Yes, that's her.

323
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,389
How did she die?

324
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,310
I don't know. I don't know
anything about her. Nothing.

325
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,560
Thank you.

326
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,750
Are you Mr Lennox,
the photographer?

327
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,874
Oh, I'm firstly a chemist,
secondly a photographer.

328
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,833
I understand you take the harvest
festival photographs every year.

329
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,554
- The ones I saw in The Green Man.
- Yes.

330
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,671
It's rather humdrum work, I'm afraid.

331
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,155
What happened
to last year's photograph?

332
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,396
Isn't it there with the others?

333
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,876
No, no, it's not. Apparently it's been
broken or damaged in some way.

334
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,994
- Oh, what a pity.
- Would you have a copy of it?

335
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,999
Oh, no, I don't keep copies.

336
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,318
Mr Lennox, you were among the people
to whom I showed the photograph

337
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,630
in the Green Man.

338
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,229
Is that the girl?

339
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,711
- It's difficult to say.
- Oh, come on, man!

340
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,676
It was only eight months ago. Surely
you remember if it was that girl or not.

341
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,479
Thank you.

342
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,874
- His lordship is expecting you, sir.
- Expecting me?

343
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,789
That's what his lordship told me, sir.
Would you please come this way?

344
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,999
In there, sir.

345
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,555
Good afternoon, Sergeant Howie.

346
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,718
I trust the sight of the young people
refreshes you.

347
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,071
No, sir, it does not refresh me.

348
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,157
Oh, I'm sorry.

349
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,511
One should always be open
to the regenerative influences.

350
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,520
I understand you're looking
for a missing girl.

351
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,517
- I've found her.
- Splendid.

352
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,196
In her grave. Your lordship is
a justice of the peace.

353
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,118
I need your permission
to exhume her body,

354
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,516
have it transported to the mainland
for a pathologist's report.

355
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,473
You suspect... foul play?

356
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,513
I suspect murder
and conspiracy to murder.

357
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,200
In that case, you must go ahead.

358
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,079
Your lordship seems
strangely unconcerned.

359
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,834
I'm confident your suspicions
are wrong, Sergeant.

360
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,511
We don't commit murder up here.
We're a deeply religious people.

361
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,475
Religious?

362
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,355
With ruined churches,
no ministers, no priests,

363
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,710
and children dancing naked!

364
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,271
They do love
their divinity lessons.

365
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,916
But t-they are... are naked.

366
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,713
Naturally. It's much too dangerous

367
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,753
to jump through the fire
with your clothes on.

368
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,549
Wh-what religion c-c-can
they possibly be learning,

369
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,830
jumping over bonfires?

370
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,633
Parthenogenesis.

371
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,280
What?

372
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,878
Literally, as Miss Rose would
doubtless say in her assiduous way,

373
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,192
reproduction without sexual union.

374
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,596
Oh, what is all this?

375
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,998
I mean, y-y-you've got
f-f-fake biology, fake religion.

376
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,272
Sir, have these children
never heard of Jesus?

377
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,472
Himself the son of a virgin,
impregnated, I believe, by a ghost.

378
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,878
Do sit down, Sergeant.

379
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,153
Shocks are so much better absorbed
with the knees bent.

380
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,640
Please.

381
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,115
Now, those children out there,

382
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,516
they're jumping through the flames

383
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,553
in the hope that the god of fire
will make them fruitful.

384
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,512
Really, you can hardly blame them.

385
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,154
After all, what girl would not prefer
the child of a god

386
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,557
to that of some acne-scarred artisan?

387
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,354
- And you encourage them in this?
- Actively.

388
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,199
It's most important that each
new generation born on Summerisle

389
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,551
be made aware that
here the old gods aren't dead.

390
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,796
But what of the true god

391
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,036
to whose glory churches
and monasteries have been built

392
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,549
on these islands for generations past?

393
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,830
Now, sir, what of him?

394
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,998
He's dead. He can't complain.

395
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,909
He had his chance,
and in the modern parlance, he blew it.

396
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,198
- What?
- It's very simple. Let me show you.

397
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,676
In the last century,
the islanders were starving.

398
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,593
Like our neighbours today,
they were scratching a bare subsistence

399
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,071
from sheep and sea.

400
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,354
Then in 1868, my grandfather
bought this barren island

401
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,630
and began to change things.

402
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,913
A distinguished Victorian scientist,
agronomist, free thinker.

403
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,753
How formidably benevolent he seems.

404
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,999
Essentially the face of a man
incredulous of all human good.

405
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,509
You're very cynical, my lord.

406
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,596
What attracted my grandfather
to the island,

407
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,714
apart from the profuse source
of wiry labour that it promised,

408
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,593
was the unique combination
of volcanic soil

409
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,633
and the warm Gulf Stream
that surrounded it.

410
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,791
You see, his experiments
had led him to believe

411
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,389
that it was possible to induce here
the successful growth

412
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,433
of certain new strains of fruit
that he had developed.

413
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,793
So, with typical mid-Victorian zeal,
he set to work.

414
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,560
The best way of accomplishing this,
so it seemed to him,

415
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,115
was to rouse the people
from their apathy

416
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,312
by giving them back
their joyous old gods,

417
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,272
and as a result of this worship,

418
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,553
the barren island would burgeon
and bring forth fruit in great abundance.

419
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,911
What he did, of course, was to develop
new cultivars of hardy fruits

420
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,117
suited to local conditions.

421
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,639
But, of course, to begin with,

422
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,876
they worked for him
because he fed them and clothed them,

423
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,954
but later, when the trees starting fruiting,
it became a very different matter.

424
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,913
And the ministers fled the island,
never to return.

425
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,759
What my grandfather
had started out of expediency,

426
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,793
my father continued out of... love.

427
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,077
He brought me up the same way,

428
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,036
to reverence the music and the drama
and the rituals of the old gods.

429
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,272
To love nature and to fear it,

430
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,478
and to rely on it and to appease it
where necessary.

431
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,911
- He brought me up...
- He brought you up to be a pagan!

432
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,753
A heathen, conceivably,
but not, I hope, an unenlightened one.

433
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,875
Lord Summerisle, I am interested
- the law.

434
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,356
But I must remind you, sir,
that despite everything you've said,

435
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,677
you are the subject
of a Christian country.

436
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,557
Now, sir, if I may have your permission
to exhume the body of Rowan Morrison.

437
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,672
I was under the impression
I'd already given it to you.

438
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,871
Ah, there's your transport.

439
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,311
It's been a great pleasure
meeting a Christian copper.

440
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:24,274
I found that
in Rowan Morrison's grave.

441
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,712
Little Rowan loved the March hares.

442
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,319
Hmm.

443
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,714
It's sacrilege!

444
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:41,074
Only if the ground is consecrated
to the Christian belief.

445
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,195
Personally, I think it makes
a very lovely transmutation.

446
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,234
I'm sure Rowan is most happy with it.
Do you not think so, Lord Summerisle?

447
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,991
Miss, I hope you don't think that
I can be made a fool of indefinitely.

448
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,396
Where is Rowan Morrison?

449
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,997
Why, here she is,
what remains of her physically.

450
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,152
Her soul, of course, may even now...

451
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,516
Lord Summerisle!

452
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,712
Where is Rowan Morrison?

453
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,837
Sergeant Howie, I think that...

454
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,999
you are supposed to be
the detective here.

455
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,790
A child is reported missing
on your island.

456
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,476
At first,
I'm told there is no such child.

457
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,873
I then find that there is, in fact,
but that she has been killed.

458
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,517
I subsequently discover that
there is no death certificate.

459
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,792
And now I find
that there is a grave.

460
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,391
There's no body.

461
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,990
Very perplexing for you.

462
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,434
What do you think could've happened?

463
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,198
I think Rowan Morrison
was murdered

464
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,200
under circumstances
of pagan barbarity,

465
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,630
which I can scarcely bring
myself to believe

466
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,434
as taking place in the 20th century.

467
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,477
Now, it is my intention tomorrow
to return to the mainland

468
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,069
and report my suspicions
to the Chief Constable

469
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,874
of the West Highland constabulary.

470
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,719
And I will demand
a full inquiry takes place

471
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,992
into the affairs of this heathen island.

472
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,994
You must, of course,
do as you see fit, Sergeant.

473
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,919
Perhaps it's just as well that
you won't be here tomorrow,

474
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,398
to be offended by the sight
of our May Day celebrations here.

475
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,870
Broome, would you kindly
show the Sergeant out?

476
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,037
- This way, sir.
- Goodbye.

477
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,313
There's hardly any produce.

478
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,795
Well, that's it, the crops failed.

479
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,473
And it's Rowan.
Rowan and the crops failed!

480
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,079
Sacrifice.

481
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,559
'Perhaps it's just as well
that you won't be here

482
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,799
'to be offended by the sight
of our May Day celebrations tomorrow.'

483
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,270
Sergeant?

484
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,910
Wake up, Sergeant.

485
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,839
- What time is it?
- It's past nine.

486
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,793
I thought you were gonna
come and see me last night.

487
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,671
I invited you.

488
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,791
I'm engaged to be married.

489
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,560
Does that stop you?

490
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,560
Ave. Aye.

491
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,433
I must say,
you are a gallant fellow, Sergeant.

492
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,877
It's nothing personal.

493
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,637
Just that I don't believe in it.

494
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,273
Before marriage.

495
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,118
Suit yourself.

496
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,880
I expect you'll be going back today.

497
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,992
You don't want to be around here
on May Day.

498
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,396
Not the way you feel.

499
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,515
We carry death out of the village!

500
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,190
We carry death
out of the village!

00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:14,319
We carry death out of the village!

502
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,158
We carry death...

00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,509
"'harmless versions of them danced
in obscure villages on May Day.

509
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,638
"'Their cast includes
many alarming characters:

510
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,876
"'a man-animal, or hobbyhorse,

511
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,516
"'who canters at the head
of the procession, charging at the girls.

512
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,870
"'A man-woman, the sinister teaser,

513
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,355
"'played by the community leader
or priest.

514
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,154
"'And a man-fool, Punch,

515
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,233
"'most complex
of all the symbolic figures,

516
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,194
"'the privileged simpleton
and king for a day.

517
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,231
"'Six swordsmen follow these figures

518
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,193
"'and at the climax of the ceremony
lock their swords together

519
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,277
"'in a clear symbol of the Sun.

520
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,359
"'In pagan times, however, these dances
were not simply picturesque jigs.

521
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,949
"'They were frenzied rites
ending in a sacrifice

522
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,037
"'by which the dancers
hoped desperately

523
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,197
"'to win over the goddess of the fields.

524
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,950
"'In good times, they offered produce
to the gods and slaughtered animals,

525
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,232
"'but in bad years,
when the harvest had been poor...

526
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,119
"'the sacrifice was a human being.

527
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,037
'Rowan's not dead!'

528
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,755
"Sometimes the victim
would be drowned in the sea

529
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,510
"or burnt to death
in a huge sacrificial bonfire.

530
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:48,510
"Sometimes the six swordsmen
ritually beheaded the virgin."

531
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,032
Dear God in Heaven,
even these people can't be that mad.

532
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,913
"The chief priest then
skinned the child,

533
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,509
"and wearing the still-warmed skin
like a mantle,

534
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,718
"led the rejoicing crowds
through the streets.

535
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,717
"The priest thus represented
the goddess reborn

536
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,435
"and guaranteed another
successful harvest next year."

537
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,551
Good morning, Sergeant!

538
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,873
I need to get to my plane.

539
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,749
Oh, well, on May Day,
I'd better take you out myself.

540
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,393
That's it.

541
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,233
Here, right.

542
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,072
I shall be back shortly
with some more police officers.

543
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,038
Have a good flight, then!

544
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,434
Hey, you come back here!

545
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,632
I said, come back here!

546
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,790
What's the matter? Won't she go?

547
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,078
No. Has anyone been here?

548
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,157
Not to my knowledge, Sergeant.

549
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,079
If any of the children had been
interfering with it,

550
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,793
I'm sure I would've seen them.

551
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,594
I warn you,
you're obstructing a police officer.

552
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,190
I am not obstructing you, Sergeant.

553
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,109
You could maybe get old Sam there
to row you to the mainland.

554
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,675
You'd be back in a week.

555
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,154
Well, I'll just have to find
Rowan Morrison myself.

556
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,517
- Everything under control, Oak?
- Aye, my lord.

557
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,110
Mr MacGreagor,

558
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,318
I trust we aren't going to have
to let out your costume again this year.

559
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:56,231
I think I'll manage, my lord, but it does
seem to shrink a little each year.

560
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,431
My friends, enough now.

561
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:15,680
We shall all reassemble
outside the town hall at 3:00 sharp,

562
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,031
and then process through the village
and the countryside,

563
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,390
down to the beach
below the stones,

564
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,433
by the route which has become
sacred to our rite.

565
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,440
This year at the procession's end,
as has already been proclaimed,

566
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:32,440
a holy sacrifice will be offered up
jointly to Nuada,

567
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,710
our most sacred god of the sun,

568
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,356
and to Avellenau,
the beloved goddess of our orchards,

569
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,713
in order that we may furnish them
with renewed power

570
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,349
to quicken the growth of our crops.

571
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,394
- Hail the Queen of the May!
- Hail the Queen of the May!

572
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,160
Hail the Queen of the May!

573
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,999
Why, Sergeant,
I thought you'd gone back.

574
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:05,193
Mrs Morrison, I don't know
if you know it or not,

575
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:08,318
but Rowan is not dead,
they've got her hidden somewhere.

576
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,919
They?

577
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,829
If you know where she is, I beg you
to tell me now before it's too late.

578
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,474
- Sergeant, I've already told you...
- In the name of God, woman!

579
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,352
What kind of mother are you,

580
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,517
that can stand by and see
your own child slaughtered?

581
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,951
Sergeant, if I were you,
I would go back to the mainland.

582
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:27,152
Stop interfering in things
that are no concern of yours.

583
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,989
I am going to search every house
in this place during the next few hours,

584
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,033
and if anybody, including you,
stands in my way,

585
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,913
they'll be arrested
as accomplices to murder.

586
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,999
You'll simply never understand
the true nature of sacrifice.

587
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,271
Heathens! Bloody heathens!

588
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,632
- Yes?
- Take those masks off!

589
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,910
- No.
- Take them off!

590
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,312
- What do you think you're doing?
- Searching every house

591
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,750
for a missing child.

592
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,153
I-I'm sorry.

593
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

594
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,555
- What's that?
- The life of the fields.

595
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,074
John Barleycorn.

596
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,316
What's in here?

597
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,151
- What's that?
- That's my costume.

598
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,596
The salmon of knowledge.

599
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

600
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,591
Hello. You're back early.

601
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,234
Where are the other coppers?

602
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,671
There aren't any.
The plane wouldn't start.

603
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,517
Give me a glass of whiskey, please.

604
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:01,759
So he spent his time instead
turning the whole village upside down.

605
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:06,431
- Just give me a glass of whiskey!
- No wonder he's worn out.

606
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,591
Did you find the girl?

607
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,439
No, well, I can't say
I'm very surprised.

608
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,395
I'm going to rest in my bed
for half an hour.

609
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,670
I do not wish to be disturbed.

610
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,519
I'd stay there until tonight,
if I was you!

611
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,712
We don't much relish strangers
around today!

612
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,194
He's asleep.

613
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,709
I don't like to use it on him, really.

614
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,599
The laird said we're to take
no chances, didn't he?

615
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:44,515
I know, but with the Hand of Glory
there's no telling when you wake.

616
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,876
- He might sleep for days.
- All the better.

617
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,274
Shh!

618
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:52,155
We don't want him butting in.
Go on, light it up.

619
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:17,990
That'll make you sleep,
my pretty Sergeant.

620
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,269
I'm away to change.
We can't do without Punch.

621
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,877
You best get on ahead.

622
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,469
They've given you girls
five minutes start, haven't they?

623
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,749
Good bye.

624
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

625
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,474
What's the matter with you,
MacGreagor? You call that dancing?

626
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,877
Cut some capers, man.
Use your bladder!

627
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,640
Play the fool.
That's what you're here for.

628
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,317
I suppose you've been getting drunk
at your own bar.

629
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,358
That's more like it!

630
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,439
Good, good!

631
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,798
- Chop!
- Chop! Chop! Chop!

632
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,356
Chop! Chop! Chop!

633
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,914
Everyone must go through,
MacGreagor.

634
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,111
It's a game of chance, remember.

635
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,513
Chop! Chop! Chop!

636
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

637
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,877
It's Holly. Well done!

638
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,310
It's wee Holly.

639
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:18,552
- Now, my friends, to the beach.
- To the beach!

640
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:40,193
O god of the sea,
I offer you this ale as a libation,

641
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,757
that you may bestow upon us
in the year to come

642
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,192
the rich and diverse fruits
of your kingdom.

643
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,758
Hail, god of the seas!

644
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,712
Accept our offering!

645
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:12,317
And now,
for our more dreadful sacrifice

646
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,592
for those who command
the fruit of the Earth.

647
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,269
It's Rowan.

648
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,873
What's the matter, Mr MacGreagor?

649
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,957
Now, don't be frightened.
I'm a police officer.

650
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,674
- I've got to try and get you away.
- Hurry, please.

651
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,430
I don't like it here. They're coming.
You know what they're going to do?

652
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,916
I know what they're going to do.
Come on, come on. Hurry, hurry!

653
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,635
We can escape through the cave.
I know the way.

654
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,554
Quickly.

655
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,953
That's the way out, up there.

656
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,396
Come on. It's through a big tunnel.

657
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,795
We seem to have lost
our torch-bearing friends.

658
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,355
I'm sorry. It was worse
than I remembered it.

659
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,836
- Did I do it right?
- You did it beautifully.

660
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,473
Dear little Rowan.

661
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,439
Rowan, darling! Come on, now.

662
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,558
Welcome, fool.

663
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:52,280
You have come of your own free will
to the appointed place.

664
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,876
The game's over.

665
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,919
Game? What game?

666
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,192
The game of the hunted
leading the hunter.

667
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,233
You came here
to find Rowan Morrison,

668
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,990
but it is we who have found you
and brought you here,

669
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:13,000
and controlled your every thought
and action since you arrived.

670
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,516
Principally,
we persuaded you to think

671
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,280
that Rowan Morrison
was being held as a sacrifice

672
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,080
because our crops failed last year.

673
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,714
I know your crops failed.
I saw the harvest photograph.

674
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:28,834
Oh, yes. They failed, all right.
Disastrously so.

675
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,316
For the first time
since my grandfather came here.

676
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,354
The blossom came, but the fruit
withered and died on the bough.

677
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:41,553
That must not happen again this year.

678
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:45,310
It is our most earnest belief that
the best way of preventing this

679
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,956
is to offer to our god of the sun
and to the goddess of our orchards

680
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:53,233
the most acceptable sacrifice
that lies in our power.

681
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:58,115
Animals are fine,
but their acceptability is limited.

682
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:02,234
A little child is even better,
but not nearly as effective

683
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,869
as the right kind of adult.

684
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,439
What do you mean,
"right kind of adult"?

685
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,349
You, Sergeant,
are the right kind of adult,

686
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,916
as our painstaking researches
have revealed.

687
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:26,273
You, uniquely,
were the one we needed.

688
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,596
A man who would come here
of his own free will.

689
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,400
A man who has come here
with the power of a king

690
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,511
by representing the law.

691
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,115
A man who would come here
as a virgin.

692
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:39,198
A man who has come here
as a fool.

693
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,396
Get out of my way.

694
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,995
You are the fool, Mr Howie.

695
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:18,479
Punch, one of the great
fool-victims of history.

696
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:23,838
For you have accepted
the role of king for a day,

697
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,713
and who but a fool would do that?

698
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:32,432
But you will be revered
and anointed as a king.

699
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,836
You will undergo death and rebirth,

700
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,957
resurrection, if you like.

701
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,355
The rebirth, sadly, will not be yours,

702
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,869
but that of our crops.

703
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,038
I am a Christian,

704
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,073
and as a Christian,
I hope for resurrection.

705
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:02,679
And even if you kill me now,

706
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,874
it is I who will live again,
not your damned apples.

707
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,159
No matter what you do,

708
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,113
you can't change the fact

709
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,550
that I believe in the life eternal,

710
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,274
as promised to us
by Our Lord, Jesus Christ.

711
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,552
As promised to us
by Our Lord, Jesus Christ!

712
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,916
That is good,
for believing what you do,

713
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:53,200
we confer upon you
a rare gift these days,

714
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,470
a martyr's death.

715
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,877
You will not only have life eternal,

716
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,516
but you will sit with the saints
among the elect.

717
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,989
Come.

718
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:09,751
It is time to keep your appointment
with The Wicker Man.

719
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,718
Now, wait!

720
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:16,993
Now, all of you,
just wait and listen to me.

721
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:22,320
And you can wrap it up any way you like.
You are about to commit murder.

722
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:26,673
Can you not see?
There is no sun god.

723
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,509
There is no goddess of the fields.

724
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:38,229
Your crops failed
because your strains failed.

725
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:43,230
Fruit is not meant to be grown
on these islands. It's against nature.

726
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:47,558
Don't you see that killing me is not
going to bring back your apples?

727
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:51,479
Summerisle, you know it won't.

728
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,513
Go on, man.
Tell them. Tell them it won't!

729
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,438
I know it will.

730
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,680
Well, don't you understand that
if your crops fail this year,

731
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,555
next year you're going to have
to have another blood sacrifice?

732
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:09,560
And next year, no one less than
the king of Summerisle himself will do.

733
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,796
If the crops fail, Summerisle,

734
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:16,670
next year your people will kill you
on May Day.

735
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,559
They will not fail.

736
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:25,915
The sacrifice of the willing king,
like virgin fool, will be accepted.

737
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:29,351
But don't you see, I'll be missed?
They'll come looking for me!

738
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:32,120
There will be no traces.
Bring him up, Oak.

739
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,629
- Go on.
- No! No!

740
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:37,718
Think! Just think what you're doing!

741
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,958
Think what you're doing! Think!

742
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,240
In the name of God,
think what you're doing!

743
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,717
Oh, God! Oh, Jesus Christ!

744
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:17,238
Oh, my God! Christ!

745
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:21,670
No, no, dear God!
No, Christ!

746
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:21,710
No! No!

747
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,993
Mighty god of the sun,
bountiful goddess of our orchards,

748
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:40,399
accept our sacrifice
and make our blossoms fruit.

749
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:45,151
Mighty god of the sun,
bountiful goddess of our orchards...

750
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:48,039
Hear ye the words of the Lord!

751
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:53,189
- ...and make our blossoms fruit.
- Awake, ye heathens, and hold!

752
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:58,713
It is the Lord who hath
laid waste your orchards!

753
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,958
- It is he who hath made them bare!
- Reverence the sacrifice.

754
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:08,315
Because the truth is withered away
from the sons of men!

755
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,720
Desire shall fail!

756
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:16,639
And ye shall all die...

757
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,229
...accursed!

758
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:46,909
Oh, God!

759
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,433
Oh, God.

760
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:16,550
...who will today depart
from this world.

761
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,358
Do not deliver me
into the enemy's hands...

762
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,551
...or put me out of mind forever.

763
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:37,594
Let me not undergo the real pains of hell,
dear God, because I die unshriven.

764
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,953
...which knows no ending.

765
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,149
...our lord.

766
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:59,359
Jesus!

767
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:04,270
Jesus!
