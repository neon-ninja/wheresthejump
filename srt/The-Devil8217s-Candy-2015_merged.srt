1
00:01:31,922 --> 00:01:33,589
Raymond!

2
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,290
Raymond!

3
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:43,449
Ray? Sweetie?

4
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:47,605
Ah, I play it loud.

5
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:50,320
Like, I can't hear him.

6
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:54,211
Pack your things,
you're going back to the hospital.

7
00:01:56,113 --> 00:02:00,183
I'm calling Daddy and he is taking you back.

8
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:51,195
Mom said you have to hurry.

9
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:54,932
- Hey.
- Is that the thing for the bank?

10
00:03:55,032 --> 00:03:57,768
Yeah. Yeah, that's a commission.

11
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:01,538
Butterflies? So not metal.

12
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:06,071
I know, I know, I agree.
But most people don't like metal.

13
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:09,961
Most people's taste is in their...

14
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:14,335
Have you not showered yet? We're late.

15
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:47,695
Guys, can we listen to something
just a little bit less heavy?

16
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:50,223
Metallica?

17
00:04:52,423 --> 00:04:55,273
I'm not sure
that's what your mom had in mind.

18
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:21,969
Wow. It's gorgeous.

19
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:38,235
Lived in Texas my whole life.

20
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:41,836
It's always been hot but, well...

21
00:05:41,936 --> 00:05:44,618
...even Satan's praying for it to rain.

22
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:52,549
As y'all can see, everything's true
to the turn of the century period.

23
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:55,252
Yeah, I... I love this wallpaper.

24
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:58,055
- Special, ain't it?
- Yeah.

25
00:05:58,155 --> 00:06:02,393
And through here, north facin',
double hung windows.

26
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:05,096
Sunlight streamin' in.

27
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:10,282
I'm not one for flowery words,
but tranquil comes to mind.

28
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:21,759
Zo, this is twice the size of the room
that you have right now.

29
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:30,001
Have fun, you're not gonna see any of them
with all the posters that you have.

30
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:35,974
If there's even one teddy left...

31
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:39,611
...you have to buy me some more.

32
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:46,083
- Okay?
- Yeah. Of course.

33
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:10,247
Could make a mighty fine bedroom
for a teenager down the track.

34
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,197
When she's ready for some space of her own.

35
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:15,632
This is gonna be Daddy's studio.

36
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:18,769
Or a studio. Yes, indeed.

37
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:24,004
Okay. By law I have to fess up
to any death in the house.

38
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:26,590
And in this case there were two.

39
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:29,423
Um, sweetie...

40
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:33,768
...I had left my bag in the car
and it's got some documents I need.

41
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:38,303
- If you want me to leave, just ask.
- Okay.

42
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:49,747
And now you can't sell it
which is why the price is so low.

43
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:55,606
Next showings at eleven,
got 'em lined up all day.

44
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:57,709
Folks love a bargain.

45
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:01,311
After all, what are we talkin' about here?

46
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:05,832
A sweet little old lady who accidentally
fell down the stairs...

47
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:09,620
...and her dear old hubby
who couldn't stand to live without her.

48
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,490
Sad, indeed...

49
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,040
...but it's not like
Charlie Manson lived here.

50
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:23,998
Can you give us a minute, please?

51
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:26,604
Thank you.

52
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:36,724
- You don't find it creepy?
- What?

53
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:38,582
- The couple?
- Yeah.

54
00:08:38,682 --> 00:08:40,206
No.

55
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:43,397
No, I actually think it's really romantic.

56
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:46,323
He loved her so much he couldn't
live another day without her.

57
00:08:46,423 --> 00:08:51,180
- You just want this studio.
- What? No.

58
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,538
I'm not even thinkin' about this.

59
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:59,203
- Can you hear that?
- What? What?

60
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:01,605
- Wait.
- What do you mean, what?

61
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:05,744
That right there. Astrid...

62
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,747
Jesse...

63
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:13,110
- You can't hear that?
- No, I can't hear that. What is it?

64
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,319
Buy me.

65
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:18,255
You don't hear that?
'Cause it's screaming at me.

66
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:20,237
I can't ignore it.

67
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:19,731
Can I help you?

68
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,468
Zo's gonna have to change schools.

69
00:11:11,568 --> 00:11:13,879
She'll be alright, she's a brave kid.

70
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:19,843
It's like two buses for me
to get to the salon.

71
00:11:19,943 --> 00:11:22,413
Not if we get a second car.

72
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:30,137
You have to do more commissions. We just...
we cannot do this on my salary alone.

73
00:11:30,237 --> 00:11:32,739
I mean, rent is one thing
but this is a serious mortgage.

74
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,133
I know, Astrid, why do you think I'm
painting fuckin' butterflies for a bank...

75
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:38,695
...even though it makes me want to puke?

76
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:47,370
Astrid, please, chill.

77
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,897
Alright. Here.

78
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:54,988
Please just... just take a hit. Okay?

79
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:13,611
Exhale.

80
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:16,945
Good.

81
00:12:19,536 --> 00:12:21,404
Close your eyes.

82
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:23,387
Close your eyes.

83
00:12:24,908 --> 00:12:26,910
Repeat after me...

84
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,980
...we just bought a house.

85
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,483
- "We just bought a house."
- Yeah!

86
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,453
And it's a beautiful fuckin' house.

87
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:39,767
- "And it is a beautiful fucking house."
- Yeah.

88
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:43,827
We're gonna be happy.

89
00:12:44,427 --> 00:12:46,763
"We're going to be happy."

90
00:12:46,863 --> 00:12:51,200
'Cause we never have to look
at that view ever again.

91
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,824
Come here.

92
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:58,078
County Sheriff's office, open up.

93
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:08,504
Can you open up a little so I can see?

94
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:10,187
Uh...

95
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,965
You know why I'm here?

96
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:21,115
I got a call about some loud music.

97
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:27,357
What's your name?

98
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:31,028
Ray.

99
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:34,964
You gonna help us both out
and keep quiet, Ray?

100
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:40,154
Yeah.

101
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:42,753
Let me hear you say it.

102
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:48,479
I'm gonna help us both out and keep quiet.

103
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,879
Good. I don't want to have to come back.

104
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,242
If I come back...

105
00:15:55,342 --> 00:15:57,788
...I got no choice but to give you
citation or ticket...

106
00:15:57,888 --> 00:15:59,903
...or worse, place you under arrest.

107
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,276
I'd much rather not.

108
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:41,444
It's never as bad as you think.

109
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,538
Seriously, you just tough out the first
30 minutes and then the rest is gravy.

110
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:50,707
I hate gravy.

111
00:16:54,243 --> 00:16:57,204
Alright, go forth, brave soldier.

112
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:10,860
Don't let your schooling get in the way
of your education, alright?

113
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,211
Yeah. I love you, Dad.

114
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:28,376
Hey, Zo.

115
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

116
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:45,467
Oh, my God.

117
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:51,147
- Zooey.
- I haven't gotten you that good in ages.

118
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:54,006
Yeah, that was hysterical.
That was super funny.

119
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:55,952
Thank you.

120
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,756
How was your first day?

121
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,808
Sucked big time.

122
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,361
Hey, hey.

123
00:21:09,865 --> 00:21:12,115
It'll get better, I promise.

124
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,768
Okay, it just takes time.
Yeah, anything new, it just takes time.

125
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:48,485
What happened to the butterflies?

126
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:53,289
Jess? Jess?

127
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:55,625
Jesse!

128
00:21:57,346 --> 00:21:59,430
Where were you?

129
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,702
What?

130
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:04,859
Where were you?

131
00:22:16,882 --> 00:22:18,733
I'll get it!

132
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:31,577
Hi.

133
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:37,684
There's someone here
and it's not the pizza man.

134
00:22:40,573 --> 00:22:41,991
Hi.

135
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:59,191
I've got one just like that.

136
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,194
A flying V.

137
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:03,496
You got a red Flying V?

138
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:07,333
I want a Gibson Flying V
like Kirk Hammett from Metallica uses.

139
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:11,104
He is my favorite guitar hero. I asked
Mom and Dad to get one for my birthday...

140
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:14,640
...but you know, Gibsons are really
expensive so I'm getting a little cheaper...

141
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,156
Excuse me.

142
00:23:18,845 --> 00:23:21,026
- Can I help you?
- Mmm.

143
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:26,218
I need to come home now.

144
00:23:27,854 --> 00:23:30,920
This is Mommy and Daddy's house.

145
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:33,559
They're dead.

146
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:36,510
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

147
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:43,803
I'm really sorry about
what happened with your parents.

148
00:23:43,903 --> 00:23:46,172
But you don't live here anymore.

149
00:23:46,272 --> 00:23:49,075
Okay. It's time for you to leave.

150
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:51,978
They won't let me play it loud.

151
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:56,563
- I need to play it loud.
- You need to leave, now.

152
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:04,588
- Dad.
- Jess... Jesse.

153
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,814
You need to leave before I call the police.

154
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:19,806
Alright, that's it, I'm calling the police.

155
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:23,042
I'm callin' 'em right now.

156
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:40,873
You were mean.

157
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:45,378
You say, "treat everyone like
the way you want to be treated."

158
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,682
You didn't do that.

159
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,775
What?

160
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:58,378
Well, the poor guy, obviously
has something wrong with him...

161
00:24:58,478 --> 00:25:01,895
...and his parents did just die in our house.

162
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:17,063
<i>We've come to the place...</i>

163
00:25:17,163 --> 00:25:20,866
<i>...where we joke about the idea of the devil.</i>

164
00:25:20,966 --> 00:25:24,337
<i>With the horns, and the tail, and all that.</i>

165
00:25:24,737 --> 00:25:27,373
<i>But that is Satan's lie...</i>

166
00:25:27,473 --> 00:25:31,311
<i>...to distract us
from the reality of who He is.</i>

167
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:35,328
<i>He is no mask in a Halloween store.</i>

168
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:39,860
<i>He's not what you see in the movies.</i>

169
00:25:42,154 --> 00:25:47,808
<i>He is an active, violent,
anti-God personal reality.</i>

170
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:55,267
<i>And as much as we refuse
to admit it, He lives through us.</i>

171
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:59,973
<i>He uses us to carry out
His unspeakable deeds.</i>

172
00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:05,211
<i>For we are His pawns,
we are His demons on Earth...</i>

173
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:07,778
<i>...we satiate His hunger.</i>

174
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:13,019
<i>If you have the slightest bit
of greed, in your heart...</i>

175
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,456
<i>...He will turn it into an avalanche.</i>

176
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:19,506
<i>He will slither into your soul.</i>

177
00:26:55,928 --> 00:26:59,032
That's really great, Zooey, that's not
gonna win you any Academy Awards.

178
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:02,802
You're not supposed to go if you're sick
because everyone else gets sick too.

179
00:27:02,902 --> 00:27:05,551
Well, it looks like we got
an outbreak on our hands.

180
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:11,076
Oh, my God. Dad.

181
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:14,413
I said I wanted a Flying V
and he's given me his.

182
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:17,179
And a Marshall, Dad,
he's given me his Marshall...

183
00:27:20,302 --> 00:27:21,885
Dad.

184
00:27:22,688 --> 00:27:24,594
I can keep 'em, right?

185
00:27:25,024 --> 00:27:28,461
Please. Please.

186
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:32,579
No. I can't let you keep this guitar.

187
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,176
Hey. Hey.

188
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,655
I'm gettin' you a guitar and an amp
for your birthday. Come on.

189
00:27:46,145 --> 00:27:48,795
Not a Flying V, and a Marshall.

190
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:08,120
I know that Leonard
already rejected my portfolio.

191
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,803
- But I just need...
- Leonard doesn't look at artists twice, Jesse.

192
00:28:10,903 --> 00:28:14,173
Yes, I know, but please.

193
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:16,542
This is different.

194
00:28:16,642 --> 00:28:19,422
I've never had a muse before.

195
00:28:19,812 --> 00:28:22,258
I don't remember painting this.

196
00:28:22,548 --> 00:28:25,299
It's like it's... it's like somethin'...

197
00:28:29,054 --> 00:28:30,971
It flowed through me.

198
00:28:56,966 --> 00:28:59,032
I'll see what I can do.

199
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:35,989
Rocky?

200
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:38,541
Here, boy.

201
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:45,698
Come on, Rocky.

202
00:31:47,286 --> 00:31:49,335
Just gonna go get Rocky.

203
00:31:51,156 --> 00:31:52,838
Rocky.

204
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,940
Here, boy.

205
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:38,151
What the fuck?

206
00:32:50,816 --> 00:32:52,699
I'm so sorry.

207
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:56,489
Hey.

208
00:32:57,339 --> 00:32:58,905
Zo.

209
00:33:05,097 --> 00:33:06,946
Okay, you know what?

210
00:33:10,035 --> 00:33:14,053
I deserve that. Okay, totally deserve that.

211
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:22,495
I'm really sorry, Zo.

212
00:33:24,366 --> 00:33:26,635
It's only my second day.

213
00:33:26,735 --> 00:33:30,436
I don't know anyone.
And you just left me here.

214
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:35,395
I was painting.

215
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:40,333
I thought that I was in there
for five minutes.

216
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:45,184
And I stepped outside and the sun
had gone down and I panicked.

217
00:33:46,605 --> 00:33:49,008
I didn't think that
I was in there for so long.

218
00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:52,192
I just... I completely got lost in it.

219
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:03,155
- Don't do it again.
- I won't.

220
00:34:03,355 --> 00:34:04,857
- Swear.
- I swear.

221
00:34:04,957 --> 00:34:06,673
On my grave.

222
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:09,208
I swear.

223
00:34:10,896 --> 00:34:13,746
Can we please be friends again? Please?

224
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:27,326
Are you gonna let me keep the guitar and amp?

225
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:33,499
Hello, Austin, it's been a while,
but are you ready to get heavy?

226
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:40,474
I said, are you ready to get heavy?

227
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:50,777
Scissor kick off the Marshall stack.

228
00:34:52,004 --> 00:34:53,819

240
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:50,501
Did you tell her that she
could keep the guitar because...

241
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:53,305
...you know, I thought
that you said that you...

242
00:36:56,278 --> 00:36:58,094
Oh, my God.

243
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:01,580
Is that...

244
00:37:06,071 --> 00:37:08,287
I didn't mean to do this.

245
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:11,944
Okay, what's going on?

246
00:37:15,314 --> 00:37:19,398
This... this is our daughter on fire.

247
00:37:20,419 --> 00:37:22,997
- She can never see this.
- Okay, well, then destroy it.

248
00:37:23,097 --> 00:37:24,890
I can't.

249
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,539
Why?

250
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:29,929
Because it isn't finished yet.

251
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:35,400
- No, it is, if you want it to be.
- No. No, it's not that simple, Astrid.

252
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,067
It's like these children are inside of me.

253
00:37:39,888 --> 00:37:44,586
Begging, screaming to be let out.

254
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:48,674
And I don't know why.

255
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,141
Come on.

257
00:42:32,497 --> 00:42:34,993
He wanted it to be you.

258
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:37,729
I wouldn't let Him.

259
00:42:38,453 --> 00:42:41,402
'Cause you're a special one.

260
00:42:50,015 --> 00:42:53,018
No. No, no, no. You can't be loud.

261
00:42:53,118 --> 00:42:56,555
He'll make me do that thing I don't wanna
do and I don't wanna do that to you.

262
00:42:56,655 --> 00:43:01,419
Please, please, please. Please, be quiet.

263
00:43:04,996 --> 00:43:09,093
If I take my hand away,
are you gonna be loud?

264
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:11,169
- No.
- Mm-mm.

265
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:12,737
Cross your heart?

266
00:43:12,837 --> 00:43:14,239
- And hope to die?
- Mm-hmm.

267
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,941
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:17,735
Okay.

269
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:22,635
Help!

270
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:32,361
Don't! Don't!

271
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,194
No!

272
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:45,228
Get out!

273
00:43:45,328 --> 00:43:48,366
Get out! Get out!

274
00:44:36,171 --> 00:44:38,232
Were the doors locked?

275
00:44:39,224 --> 00:44:42,397
Uh, yes, they were but, um...

276
00:44:42,497 --> 00:44:45,790
- Jess went out to the studio...
- I'm so sorry.

277
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:48,593
It's not your fault.

278
00:44:50,752 --> 00:44:52,647
It's his fault.

279
00:44:53,939 --> 00:44:56,908
Now you mentioned that
he'd lived here before you all?

280
00:44:57,008 --> 00:44:58,703
Mm-hmm.

281
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:02,614
- Still the same locks?
- Yeah.

282
00:45:02,714 --> 00:45:04,849
Then there's every chance
that he has a key...

283
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:07,185
...which means you need to change them locks.

284
00:45:07,285 --> 00:45:08,980
Okay.

285
00:45:10,071 --> 00:45:14,746
And I think it's best if you folks move
into a motel. Even just for a few days.

286
00:45:15,026 --> 00:45:18,933
Give us some time to run the prints
and take a real good look into this guy.

287
00:45:19,798 --> 00:45:24,576
I'll be stationed outside all night
until you're up and out in the morning.

288
00:45:24,676 --> 00:45:26,514
So don't you worry.

289
00:45:26,614 --> 00:45:28,666
You're gonna be alright.

290
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:41,486
Try and get some sleep, okay.
It's gonna make you feel a lot better.

291
00:45:41,586 --> 00:45:43,834
What if he comes back?

292
00:45:45,557 --> 00:45:48,745
Well, that's why the police lady is outside.

293
00:45:51,429 --> 00:45:53,725
What if he gets past her?

Astrid. I'm so sorry.
I thought that you were...

297
00:46:58,096 --> 00:47:00,758
I'm okay. I'm okay.

298
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:04,328
I'm ready for school.

299
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:08,873
- No...
- Sweetie...

300
00:47:08,973 --> 00:47:12,036
Sweetie, you don't have
to go to school today.

301
00:47:13,011 --> 00:47:14,976
It's safer than here.

302
00:47:47,779 --> 00:47:50,274
If he comes back, I'll smash him.

303
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:55,580
I'm gonna be late.

304
00:47:56,604 --> 00:47:58,052
Bye.

305
00:48:27,228 --> 00:48:29,297
Oh, fuck.

306
00:48:33,091 --> 00:48:35,520
- Hey.
- <i>Jesse.</i>

307
00:48:36,828 --> 00:48:39,297
- Yeah.
- <i>It's Mara.</i>

308
00:48:39,397 --> 00:48:41,833
I showed Leonard your painting.

309
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:44,262
He approves.

310
00:48:47,372 --> 00:48:50,925
- That's, uh, that's...
- <i>He'd like to come by your studio.</i>

311
00:48:51,025 --> 00:48:53,978
- <i>See what you're working on.</i>
- Yeah, yeah. No, definitely.

312
00:48:54,078 --> 00:48:58,576
- That's great, any time.
- <i>Leonard's got an opening at three.</i>

313
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:02,954
- Wait, today?
- <i>Yes.</i>

314
00:49:03,054 --> 00:49:07,118
No, I can't.
I have to pick my daughter up at three.

315
00:49:14,499 --> 00:49:16,727
I can push it back to two.

316
00:49:17,385 --> 00:49:19,447
But that's all I can do.

317
00:49:20,205 --> 00:49:22,233
<i>Take it or leave it, Jesse.</i>

318
00:49:31,232 --> 00:49:33,060
Come on.

319
00:50:25,403 --> 00:50:28,466
What this is, Jesse, is a show of faith.

320
00:50:30,374 --> 00:50:33,037
But I'm willing to take that chance.

321
00:50:33,911 --> 00:50:36,341
Because your latest work is...

322
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:40,590
...wonderfully disturbing.

323
00:50:43,154 --> 00:50:45,092

The world's oldest unblended cognac.

327
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,382
That's what we've been sharing.

328
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,101
Beside the moment of course.

329
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:15,340
Now that you're being represented by Belial.

330
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,756
It's time for you to start
getting used to nice things.

331
00:51:18,856 --> 00:51:20,884
Uh, Leonard...

332
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,304
...I'd love to sit here and drink
this whole bottle with you right now...

333
00:51:25,404 --> 00:51:28,399
...really, I would,
but I gotta pick my daughter up.

334
00:51:28,499 --> 00:51:31,936
I'm sure your daughter won't mind
if you're one or two minutes late.

335
00:51:32,036 --> 00:51:34,105
I'm already pushing it.

336
00:51:34,305 --> 00:51:36,814
What's a few minutes in the grander scheme?

337
00:51:37,942 --> 00:51:40,212
Actually, it's everything.

338
00:51:40,812 --> 00:51:43,644
I'm not gonna get into it
right now, just trust me.

339
00:51:43,744 --> 00:51:45,593
I can't be late.

340
00:51:47,822 --> 00:51:49,699
Well, as they say...

341
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:53,751
"nothing of true worth comes without some...

342
00:51:55,493 --> 00:51:57,034
...sacrifice."

343
00:52:03,127 --> 00:52:05,103
To sacrifice.

00:52:47,712 --> 00:52:49,573
Oh, no.

346
00:53:04,168 --> 00:53:06,041
Come on!

347
00:53:17,942 --> 00:53:19,787
Come on.

348
00:53:50,841 --> 00:53:52,470
Zooey!

349
00:55:36,747 --> 00:55:38,575
He's right.

350
00:55:40,084 --> 00:55:42,900
You are the sweetest candy of them all.

351
00:55:44,054 --> 00:55:47,308
I have to do that thing I don't wanna do now.

352
00:55:48,693 --> 00:55:51,562
Please. Please.

353
00:55:51,662 --> 00:55:55,266
Let me go, please!

354
00:55:55,366 --> 00:55:56,995
Please!

355
00:59:11,562 --> 00:59:13,205
You...

356
00:59:14,405 --> 00:59:17,392
...swore on my grave.

357
00:59:33,417 --> 00:59:35,292
Look, um...

358
00:59:36,089 --> 00:59:39,174
I know it doesn't seem
like it right now but...

359
00:59:39,274 --> 00:59:41,518
...she's actually very lucky.

360
00:59:43,561 --> 00:59:47,731
When he was twelve, he did
the same thing to a 9-year-old girl.

361
00:59:47,831 --> 00:59:51,328
Hit her over the head with a rock
and then he tried to bury her.

362
00:59:52,106 --> 00:59:56,590
Case went to juvenile court and he
ended up in state psychiatric for 20 years.

363
01:00:00,027 --> 01:00:02,034
Does it say in there...

364
01:00:02,784 --> 01:00:04,377
...why he did it?

365
01:00:11,955 --> 01:00:13,984
"I have to feed Him children.

366
01:00:15,225 --> 01:00:17,888
Because children are His candy."

367
01:00:19,163 --> 01:00:22,593
He goes on to clarify who "He" is...

368
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:26,530
...none other than Satan himself.

369
01:00:35,896 --> 01:00:37,791
Thanks for your patience.

370
01:00:38,632 --> 01:00:40,437
How's she doin'?

371
01:00:42,486 --> 01:00:44,522
Like I was tellin' Jesse here.

372
01:00:44,622 --> 01:00:49,920
I think the best course of action
is to put you into witness protection.

373
01:00:51,128 --> 01:00:53,264
And how long does witness protection last?

374
01:00:53,364 --> 01:00:55,826
As long as it takes to find him.

375
01:01:05,743 --> 01:01:07,271
Just the gas?

376
01:01:24,094 --> 01:01:26,497
- Need a hand with that?
- Nope. I got it.

377
01:01:26,597 --> 01:01:28,632
- You sure?
- Yep.

378
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:30,363
Okay.

379
01:01:30,663 --> 01:01:32,207
Alright.

380
01:01:36,173 --> 01:01:38,990
Thank you. Your key, officer.

381
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:41,504
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

382
01:01:43,544 --> 01:01:46,750
- I really feel bad for that little girl.
- Yeah.

383
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:49,741
It's gonna be a long time
before she sleeps through the night.

384
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

385
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Where is he? He was just here.
- Dad?

386
01:02:57,788 --> 01:03:00,857
No! No.

387
01:03:00,957 --> 01:03:03,560
Zo. I'll be right back.

388
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:25,437
Zooey! Zooey!

389
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
He's right outside of our door!

390
01:04:40,824 --> 01:04:43,887
- Run!
- Zooey, come on!

391
01:06:19,723 --> 01:06:23,193
No. No. No.

392
01:06:23,593 --> 01:06:25,222
No!

393
01:06:25,495 --> 01:06:27,164
No!

394
01:06:27,514 --> 01:06:29,616
Mom! Daddy!

395
01:06:29,716 --> 01:06:33,204
No! No! No! No!

396
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:35,940
No!

397
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,069
No!

398
01:07:04,408 --> 01:07:05,902
Jesse.

399
01:07:06,002 --> 01:07:07,828
Jess...

400
01:07:12,877 --> 01:07:16,141
No. Zooey, Zooey.

401
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,923
Please, don't hurt her.
Please, don't hurt her, please.

402
01:07:27,023 --> 01:07:29,052
No, stop!

403
01:07:31,228 --> 01:07:32,866
Zooey, don't.

404
01:08:04,494 --> 01:08:06,730
- No! No!
- No, no. No!

405
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:08,658
No!

406
01:08:21,278 --> 01:08:23,139
Mom!

407
01:08:25,849 --> 01:08:28,944
No, no! No!

408
01:08:31,421 --> 01:08:34,446
Please, please, please.

409
01:08:37,961 --> 01:08:39,729
Please.

410
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:41,932
Jesse.

411
01:08:42,032 --> 01:08:45,235
Jesse, you have to wake up, he's got her.

412
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:49,277
Jesse.

413
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:55,672
Jesse!

414
01:09:02,535 --> 01:09:04,504
Where is she?

415
01:09:04,604 --> 01:09:07,390
No! No!

416
01:09:08,692 --> 01:09:11,895
No! No, no, no!

417
01:09:11,995 --> 01:09:14,531
No, no, no!

418
01:09:16,733 --> 01:09:20,161
Look, look, look! Look.

419
01:09:21,371 --> 01:09:23,173
It's Him.

420
01:09:45,762 --> 01:09:48,563
Hang on, Zooey!

421
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:53,743
No, no, no!

422
01:10:15,825 --> 01:10:17,612
Daddy!

423
01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:34,504
Daddy!

424
01:10:43,303 --> 01:10:45,439
No, no.

425
01:11:38,408 --> 01:11:41,511
Zo... Zooey. Zooey, you need to come to me.

426
01:11:41,611 --> 01:11:44,180
- Just jump really fast.
- I can't!

427
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,283
Please trust me.

428
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:49,319
I'm gonna catch you, Zo.

429
01:12:07,337 --> 01:12:09,138
Are you okay?

430
01:12:21,114 --> 01:12:22,864
Zooey.

431
01:13:10,734 --> 01:13:12,566
Where are you going?

432
01:13:17,073 --> 01:13:21,511
I can feel them inside me...

433
01:13:21,611 --> 01:13:25,626
...begging, screaming to be let out.

434
01:13:26,816 --> 01:13:28,881
<i>And I don't know why.</i>
