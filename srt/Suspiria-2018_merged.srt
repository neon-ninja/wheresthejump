This song, it's stuck
in my head, and it's so loud.

11
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:56,606
They're going to try and keep
her alive after all.

12
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:57,633
Markos?

13
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,914
I have to tell Sara
to get out of there.

14
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:44,160
She's the only girl
I actually give a damn about.

15
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:52,544
If I leave without her they may
pick her next.

16
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:54,111
Or Olga

17
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:55,712
I should warn Olga, too.

18
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:00,607
Olga's already figured out
things.

19
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:02,914
She saw how they groomed me.

20
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:08,193
There's more in that building
than what you can see.

21
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,802
They've been underground
since the war.

22
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:28,577
And you think
they can hear you now?

23
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:52,578
At the beginning they gave me things.
Perfect balance, perfect sleep.

24
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:55,616
Talking with our minds.

25
00:04:55,618 --> 00:04:57,634
But they took my hair.

26
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:04,320
They took my urine. They took my
eyes!

27
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:06,402
Now she can see me.

Mother Markos.

31
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,562
Oh, she wants
to get inside of me.

32
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:37,185
I can feel her.

33
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:38,659
Oh, I thought I wanted it.

34
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:45,698
I let it happen.

35
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:35,138
If they find out I was here they
won't hesitate.

36
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:27,782
Morning, pastor.

37
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:58,311
- You're Miss Tanner.
- Yes, come in.

38
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:07,369
<i>Nah?</i>

39
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:14,345
I tried to call you at your hotel this
morning to ask you if you could reschedule.

40
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:20,966
- Why?
- Company business. It's not a good time just today.

41
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:22,504
But here you are.

42
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:07,368
And six, and seven, and eight..

43
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,672
Elbows up. And one...

44
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:12,105
Come in, Susie.

45
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:20,167
<i>Miss Millius and Miss Mandel are
the company's apetitas.</i>

46
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:24,009
And Viva Blanc? I was told she
would be here.

47
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:29,256
Oh dear, you have no
formal training or references.

48
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:35,018
Your insistence to audition happened
to catch Madame Blanc on a good day.

49
00:13:35,786 --> 00:13:38,345
But you really shouldn't be here
at all.

50
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:43,752
Do you understand? Yeah? Good.

51
00:13:57,673 --> 00:14:01,992
I prefer dancing without music.
<i>Danke shoen.</i>

52
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:04,010
You can keep time
in your head, yes?

53
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:49,193
Hypnos. Here we have the line between
the elbows. Face forward. Perfect.

54
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:54,248
And morphos. Here, not so close
to the face.

55
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,233
More like you're holding
a bird or something.

56
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:53,897
- <i>..or something.</i>
<i>- They did it when we were in morning rehearsal.</i>

57
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:55,817
<i>They just put her things in
shipping boxes.</i>

58
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:58,601
<i>You don't think she had to go
underground, do you?</i>

59
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:01,545
<i>I don't care what happened. I
just wanted a call.</i>

60
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:02,604
<i>I'm really worried.</i>

61
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,139
Fraulein Bannion. <i>Kommen Sie.</i>

62
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:15,849
<i>I've just spoken with Madame
Blanc.</i>

63
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:16,972
<i>Well done, Miss Bannion.</i>

64
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:27,626
I imagine you will need to return home to settle
things and make arrangements for moving to Berlin.

65
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:30,348
No, no, I can start right now.

66
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:32,332
Good!

67
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:38,634
This is Miss Boutaher, our
technical director.

68
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:39,980
<i>Guten tag.</i>

69
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:44,746
And this is Miss Vendegast, she
acts as house mother.

70
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:47,020
...for our dancers
who reside here.

71
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,499
Where do you come from?

72
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,549
Ohio.

73
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:04,266
We operate as sort of a cooperative, as
we cannot pay our dancers a lot of money.

74
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:07,149
We offer dormatory style homes,
rent free.

75
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:10,027
You don't charge anything at
all?

76
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,148
Not a mark.

77
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:21,516
In this company we fully understand the
importance of a woman's financial autonomy.

78
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:28,109
Normally we would be full at this time
of year, but we have had a room open.

79
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:30,157
Yeah. Patricia's.

80
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:33,322
Do you know Patricia?

81
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:34,509
Mmm...

82
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:39,790
No, I heard some girls talking
about her in the hall.

83
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:50,381
Now that you're one of us, I won't be coy. Patricia
has just left the company under sad circumstances.

84
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:54,286
We think she won't be back, so
there's room if you want.

85
00:17:54,478 --> 00:17:58,509
We'll send you one of our girls
to help you with your luggage.

86
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,603
After lunch? It's alright for
you?

87
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:10,347
Yes! It's all... yes. It's
perfect.

88
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,716
- Hello, hi, I'm sorry I'm late. It's the rain.
- Hi.

89
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:40,972
Whenever it rains, everyone jumps in a
cab and like an idiot I just let ours go.

90
00:18:40,974 --> 00:18:44,397
Hi, I'm Sara, and we're going to have
to take our chances on the street.

91
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:45,803
Do you have an umbrella?

92
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:51,116
Oh, when you weren't here by 6, I had
to take the room for another night.

93
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:54,412
God, Susie, I'm sorry, everything
was a mess at the company today.

94
00:18:54,414 --> 00:18:56,876
Why are you smiling?

95
00:18:56,878 --> 00:19:02,924
I'm sorry, um, when you said Berlin a
second ago you said everyone in Berlin

96
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:07,821
and I just thought, that includes
me now, I live in Berlin.

97
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:11,791
Yes, congrats. I heard you were
a sensation today.

98
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:14,446
Have you called your
family yet, to tell them?

99
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:18,190
Miss Blanc came
into my audition.

100
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,757
- But she left right after.
- She's incredible.

101
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,806
The way she transmits her work, her energy. When it
shines on you it's addictive is the word for it.

102
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:33,836
She's tough. She kept the
company alive through the war.

103
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:37,039
When the right just wanted women to shut off
their minds and keep their uteruses open.

104
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:39,949
There was Blanc.

105
00:19:39,951 --> 00:19:41,871
Thank you.

106
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:45,325
What? Was that French?

107
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:58,255
It's a bomb! I can smell it.

108
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:00,175
There's a bank that way.

109
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,623
Don't you know what's happening
here?

110
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:09,133
The hijackers are negotiating the
release of the prisoners tonight.

111
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:12,302
The RAF. Baader Meinhoff.

112
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:17,549
They kidnapped an executive,
during war, the Nazi SS

113
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:23,853
an officer, and now he run's the
German employer's association.

114
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,647
You don't get how awful that is,
do you?

115
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,071
I'm sorry.

116
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,333
I'm just worried about my
friend.

117
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:41,872
<i>Danke shoen.</i>

118
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:44,403
Bedrooms are on the second
floor.

119
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:06,867
Why don't you try speaking to
me like you love me? Hm?

120
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:10,931
For a change?

121
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:16,084
This is my room. And here... is
yours!

122
00:27:16,086 --> 00:27:18,869
We're neighbors

123
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:22,357
You can knock on the wall if you
ever need anything.

124
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:52,983
- Good morning. Good morning.
- Hello. - Good morning.

125
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,599
How's your knee? Okay?

126
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:01,622
Thank you.

127
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:13,781
We have some happier company
business today, we have a new dancer.

128
00:29:13,783 --> 00:29:17,301
This is Susie Bannion, who is
joining us from America.

129
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:22,133
I was privileged to witness her audition
yesterday, we are very lucky to have her.

130
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,735
Would you like
to say something, Susie?

131
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:29,493
Um, I don't know.

132
00:29:29,495 --> 00:29:33,782
Hello

133
00:29:33,784 --> 00:29:36,245
I feel like I'm not even here
yet, I don't know.

134
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:43,381
You join in whenever you feel ready, but
there's no rush. Welcome to our little family.

135
00:29:43,383 --> 00:29:45,846
- I'm Susie.
- Hi.

136
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:50,646
Alright, so for today's rehearsal, I want to
pick up exactly where we left off with Volk.

137
00:29:50,648 --> 00:29:54,261
I've spoken with Olga, and she's
going to dance Patricia's part.

138
00:29:54,263 --> 00:30:00,054
And, Sara, I'd like you to dance
Olga's part.

139
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:05,333
Is everyone happy with that? Ok,
good.

140
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:20,757
No, no no, music off please! One
moment.

141
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:27,030
Ok, so, and one and two and three.
You pull it from the ground, alright?

142
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:32,309
Gravity, remember. And everyone
from here, please? And Tanner

143
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:39,992
One and two and three. And one and two
and three

144
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,439
- This is shit. Such shit.
- Ok.

145
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:58,361
Ok, why don't we all break for
ten minutes.

146
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:04,246
- You can't even be bothered to respect your lies
- Miss Ivanova!

147
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:06,359
No no no no no. It's ok.

148
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:07,832
Let's face this.

149
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,759
Patricia is gone, Olga. We don't know where. If she's
gone into hiding, she wouldn't have told us, would she?

150
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:22,102
- She was have told someone.
- We know she had dealings with people who were interested in targets.

151
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:25,527
- We know there was another bomb in Kreuzberg last night.
- She wouldn't do that.

152
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:31,287
Shhshhshh. She wanted to live her beliefs.
Who doesn't admire that?

153
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:38,871
There's so much to change in the world. If she wants to live
in a cellar filling bottles with petrol, that's her choice.

154
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:42,519
And who won't be heartbroken if
she's shot by police.

155
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:45,272
You manipulate everything.

156
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:50,487
- She didn't trust you because
you are hypocrites!

157
00:31:50,489 --> 00:31:54,295
- Will you take Olga
to her room, please, Tanner?

158
00:31:54,297 --> 00:31:55,993
No, Miss Tanner!

159
00:31:57,306 --> 00:32:00,441
Call Olga a cab. She's had
enough.

160
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:06,391
And is going to pack her things and
get the fuck out of this box of rabies.

161
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:24,793
I'm sorry about that.

162
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:28,281
It's a hot thing we do.

163
00:32:33,562 --> 00:32:37,688
Ok, so, who will dance the
protagonist?

164
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:42,040
- Sonja?
- I can't. Not yet.

165
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:43,321
Caroline?

166
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:52,792
Very well. We'll manage. I suggest
that we all take it from the top.

167
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:54,329
I'll dance.

168
00:33:03,611 --> 00:33:06,136
I know it. It's in the
documentary.

169
00:33:06,138 --> 00:33:08,378
I-I've seen it a hundred times
at the library.

170
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,944
Sweetheart, we rehearsed this
piece

171
00:33:13,946 --> 00:33:16,602
for ten months
before we performed it.

172
00:33:17,882 --> 00:33:23,673
- I've seen it in person too.
- First do it alone, then.

173
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:26,649
We don't want to put the others
at risk.

174
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,855
The last thing we need

175
00:33:28,857 --> 00:33:32,186
is someone to get kicked
in the ribs.

176
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:37,722
All right?

177
00:34:32,763 --> 00:34:35,770
Ok, stop. Stop, stop.

178
00:34:35,772 --> 00:34:43,193
Alright. Clear your head. I want you
to start over. Have you stretched?

179
00:34:43,195 --> 00:34:44,987
This is no joke.

180
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,315
Olga.

181
00:36:18,173 --> 00:36:19,709
<i>Olga.</i>

182
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:26,076
<i>Come over here! Come.</i>

183
00:36:26,078 --> 00:36:27,996
<i>Come to me.</i>

184
00:36:53,053 --> 00:37:00,636
Remember you start on one with the music, and if you
feel ill at any time, just stop. You start here.

185
00:37:00,638 --> 00:37:01,661
And...

186
00:38:00,254 --> 00:38:02,108
Louder!

187
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:11,583
Bravo. Bravo, Susie.

188
00:40:18,497 --> 00:40:19,648
It'll pass.

189
00:40:20,608 --> 00:40:22,016
You're not the first dancer who
lost the room.

190
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,373
I'm not usually dizzy.

191
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:32,256
An occasional collapse is a
vocational hazard I'm afraid.

192
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:35,712
I... I didn't... I
didn't collapse.

193
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:39,168
You're on the floor and that's
not where the dance ends.

194
00:40:42,497 --> 00:40:45,246
I was trying not to throw up
in your studio.

195
00:40:45,248 --> 00:40:47,809
Susie, it's fine.
It was wonderful.

196
00:40:48,769 --> 00:40:52,127
Sara, could you take her to her
room please?

197
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:54,464
You can rest
for the rest of the day.

198
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:09,345
- How unlikely.
- <i>OK, come on girls. Let's go.</i>

199
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:12,991
<i>And one, and two, and three.</i>

200
00:41:12,993 --> 00:41:14,369
And...

201
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:05,441
No, Susie. We have to study
America.

202
00:42:07,682 --> 00:42:09,314
I said no.

203
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:13,313
Susanna.

204
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:08,229
You don't look better.

205
00:46:08,645 --> 00:46:11,013
Or are you this pale
all the time?

206
00:46:12,261 --> 00:46:13,893
I will leave you.

207
00:46:15,237 --> 00:46:16,293
Good night.

208
00:46:25,734 --> 00:46:28,805
The Amish split from the
Mennonites in the 17th century.

209
00:46:29,509 --> 00:46:32,293
They were worried the Mennonites
were becoming too liberal.

210
00:46:33,253 --> 00:46:35,045
"They", not "we"?

211
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:38,117
You've left religious thinking
behind you then?

212
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:41,348
Are you not comfortable talking
about these things?

213
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:43,270
I don't know why we are.

214
00:46:43,462 --> 00:46:45,347
It's difficult not to be curious
about you.

215
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:49,638
In two days you've auditioned,
been accepted and danced a lead.

216
00:46:51,014 --> 00:46:53,445
How did your journey towards us
begin?

217
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:56,870
I went to New York, to the
Martha Graham Center.

218
00:46:57,734 --> 00:47:00,166
I saw you there three times.

219
00:47:00,678 --> 00:47:04,868
I went once by bus and I
hitchhiked the other two.

220
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,470
That's risky.

221
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:09,701
Were you punished?

222
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,038
Yeah.

223
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:15,430
But I felt I had to see you.

224
00:47:23,783 --> 00:47:29,541
What did it feel today to dance <i>Volk</i>
in front of the one who made it?

225
00:47:29,543 --> 00:47:33,606
I know that's a vain question.
Let me ask you another.

226
00:47:33,895 --> 00:47:38,213
When you were dancing
what did it feel like

227
00:47:38,215 --> 00:47:41,638
inside you, inside your body?

228
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:51,175
It felt like what I think it
must feel like to fuck.

229
00:47:51,623 --> 00:47:53,412
You mean to fuck a man.

230
00:47:53,414 --> 00:47:57,413
No, I...
was thinking of an animal.

231
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:07,239
You looked...

232
00:48:17,544 --> 00:48:20,934
I'm going to ask Caroline to
work on your jumps with you.

233
00:48:20,936 --> 00:48:24,005
Yours are nowhere near good
enough yet.

234
00:48:24,007 --> 00:48:25,703
We'll have to build you up.

235
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:30,982
So that I can dance the
protagonist when you perform it.

236
00:48:30,984 --> 00:48:34,662
I need to see you dance at this
level time and time again.

237
00:48:34,664 --> 00:48:35,719
I can do it.

238
00:48:41,415 --> 00:48:44,295
Olga made <i>Volk</i> seem like such
heavy lifting.

239
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:48,487
She never understood the heart
of <i>Vol</i>.

240
00:48:50,695 --> 00:48:52,902
She lacked conviction.

241
00:48:52,904 --> 00:48:54,696
I'm relieved she's gone.

242
00:48:56,552 --> 00:48:59,367
Thank you for your help
with that.

243
00:49:05,863 --> 00:49:12,776
Madame Blanc wants me to dance
the protagonist in <i>Volk.</i>

244
00:49:15,111 --> 00:49:17,543
I didn't think it was going to
be like this.

245
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:21,702
She's so kind.

246
00:49:21,704 --> 00:49:23,303
That's wonderful.

247
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:28,456
Are you all right?

248
00:49:30,344 --> 00:49:33,128
I'm fine. I was just...

249
00:49:35,656 --> 00:49:40,360
I was just thinking about what Olga
said in rehearsal... about Patricia.

250
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:43,238
What do you mean?

251
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,537
She was active
in some political groups.

252
00:49:48,457 --> 00:49:51,337
No one knows where she is
really, if she's all right.

253
00:49:53,096 --> 00:49:57,321
Was it true... what Olga said?

254
00:49:59,305 --> 00:50:00,616
Yes.

255
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,296
Patricia didn't trust
the matrons.

256
00:50:05,673 --> 00:50:07,753
And I never understood why.

257
00:50:11,497 --> 00:50:14,695
If I asked you for a favor
tomorrow would you do it?

258
00:50:14,697 --> 00:50:15,848
Yes.

259
00:50:22,857 --> 00:50:25,129
We might get caught.

260
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:27,113
Okay.

261
00:51:12,106 --> 00:51:13,736
<i>Mother. Mother.</i>

262
00:51:18,698 --> 00:51:20,297
<i>Mother. Mother.</i>

263
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:24,648
<i>Susanna.</i>

264
00:52:59,788 --> 00:53:00,939
- <i>Guten Morgen.</i>
- <i>Guten Morgen.</i>

265
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:04,075
<i>Guten Morgen.</i>

266
00:53:15,883 --> 00:53:17,707
<i>Okay, well, let's meet soon.</i>

267
00:53:21,483 --> 00:53:24,363
<i>Yeah, right across from...</i>

268
00:53:24,715 --> 00:53:27,467
<i>Yeah, no, I'm ready. I'm
almost out the door.</i>

269
00:53:30,764 --> 00:53:33,035
- <i>I'll see you soon.</i>
- <i>Marketa.</i>

270
00:53:34,284 --> 00:53:37,611
- Marketa, come on.
- I'll see you soon.

271
00:53:39,499 --> 00:53:40,459
Come on.

272
00:53:58,284 --> 00:53:59,788
Come, come, come.

273
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,129
Are you sure no one's coming?

274
00:54:13,131 --> 00:54:15,274
Oh, I'm sure. Don't worry.

275
00:54:15,276 --> 00:54:17,261
Nobody comes here
during the weekend.

276
00:54:44,429 --> 00:54:45,899
Patricia's isn't here.

277
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:47,757
Try looking for Olga's.

278
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:49,964
Olga...

279
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,076
She's not here.

280
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:55,818
I just need a number.

281
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,098
For her parents.

282
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,693
Or someone who can tell me for
sure she is or isn't in Berlin.

283
00:55:21,422 --> 00:55:22,540
How odd.

284
00:55:27,181 --> 00:55:28,395
1961.

285
00:55:30,253 --> 00:55:31,725
1955.

286
00:55:33,422 --> 00:55:35,085
1949.

287
00:55:36,718 --> 00:55:37,869
It's bizarre.

288
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:44,620
<i>Here kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.</i>

289
00:56:29,934 --> 00:56:32,366
There's nothing. Come on.

290
00:56:36,718 --> 00:56:39,022
Sit down.

291
00:56:43,279 --> 00:56:51,628
This morning we turn our instincts inward. Miss Milius,
Miss Mandel, can you close the mirrors please?

292
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:52,654
Miss Marks, no music.

293
00:57:01,263 --> 00:57:07,342
I want to start work on a new
piece, a piece about rebirths.

294
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:13,199
The inevitable pull that they exert,
and our efforts to escape them.

295
00:57:14,702 --> 00:57:20,142
We learn it now, but Susie, you
will improvise freely at its heart.

296
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:22,383
I'm interested
in your instincts here.

297
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,422
The piece will be called <i>Wieder
Offnen</i>, Open Again.

298
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:38,927
<i>Allez.</i>

299
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:53,069
<i>One, two, three, four,
one, two, three, four...</i>

300
00:58:45,296 --> 00:58:46,894
One.

301
01:00:26,194 --> 01:00:28,079
Did something happen?

302
01:00:28,081 --> 01:00:30,257
- Hmm?
- To you, during it?

303
01:00:31,954 --> 01:00:33,105
No.

304
01:00:34,546 --> 01:00:36,113
Did you... did you...

305
01:00:37,169 --> 01:00:39,889
Did you feel something there?

306
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:44,047
Someone?

307
01:00:44,049 --> 01:00:45,650
Or just something.

308
01:00:46,929 --> 01:00:48,815
What made you say that?

309
01:00:48,817 --> 01:00:49,938
I don't know.

310
01:00:52,787 --> 01:00:55,506
Am I confusing you?

311
01:00:56,498 --> 01:00:58,225
No, it's, um...

312
01:00:59,218 --> 01:01:01,424
It's odd... It's the...

313
01:01:01,426 --> 01:01:04,306
The sort of thing Patricia would
say. Bizarre.

314
01:01:06,226 --> 01:01:07,186
Come on.

315
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:09,904
Let's get changed or Sonia will
leave without us.

316
01:01:09,906 --> 01:01:11,152
I've got a dress you can wear.

317
01:01:11,154 --> 01:01:12,465
Double caposhi.

318
01:01:27,186 --> 01:01:29,168
<i>Susie!</i>

319
01:01:40,051 --> 01:01:41,747
Oh, Susie!

320
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,149
<i>Is it true?</i>

321
01:04:00,885 --> 01:04:02,484
Is it true?

322
01:04:07,988 --> 01:04:09,748
I know who I am!

323
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:13,269
I know who I am!

324
01:04:18,517 --> 01:04:22,067
It's all right. It's OK.

325
01:04:22,069 --> 01:04:24,083
Is she all right?

326
01:04:24,085 --> 01:04:25,010
It's just a nightmare.

327
01:04:25,012 --> 01:04:27,091
Markos company special.

328
01:04:27,093 --> 01:04:28,980
I'm surprised it took this long.

329
01:04:28,982 --> 01:04:31,188
Hey, let me know
if she needs a Valium.

330
01:04:38,677 --> 01:04:41,363
She's right. I dreamt of
hairballs and toilets

331
01:04:41,365 --> 01:04:44,149
for three weeks before I got
a decent night of sleep here.

332
01:04:46,005 --> 01:04:46,997
Move over.

333
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:01,652
I've only ever slept in bed with
my sister.

334
01:05:01,654 --> 01:05:03,285
We're sisters now.

335
01:06:54,807 --> 01:06:56,759
Herr Klemperer?

336
01:09:05,561 --> 01:09:10,359
And one, and two, and three,
and one, and two, and three...

337
01:09:28,921 --> 01:09:30,361
Do you want to do the jumps?

338
01:09:31,482 --> 01:09:32,793
OK

339
01:09:33,945 --> 01:09:40,632
And one, and two, and three,
and one, and two, and three

340
01:09:40,634 --> 01:09:43,258
No, elbows higher.

341
01:09:43,514 --> 01:09:44,951
All right, one moment.

342
01:09:44,953 --> 01:09:48,760
Susie, part of the jump is muscle,
and that will develop as you condition

343
01:09:48,762 --> 01:09:51,991
but you seem to have an aversion
to them and I don't quite see why.

344
01:09:51,993 --> 01:09:54,873
Are you so happy to be stuck to the earth?

345
01:09:55,194 --> 01:09:58,872
There's a yield before the push which I
don't think you're quite understanding.

346
01:09:58,874 --> 01:10:02,010
Caroline. Could you come and do
a series for us, please?

347
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:18,489
Thank you.

348
01:10:19,994 --> 01:10:21,210
And now you.

349
01:10:46,363 --> 01:10:51,673
What I really want is to be on
the floor right now anyway.

350
01:10:51,675 --> 01:10:57,496
Well, of course. That's because you're mistaking
physical weakness with artistic preference.

351
01:10:57,498 --> 01:10:59,161
And because you're tired.

352
01:11:02,683 --> 01:11:08,441
At this point, the jumps are opposing
the pull of the structure but...

353
01:11:08,443 --> 01:11:11,288
It's soon for that,
don't you think?

354
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:16,632
The floor work is-is keeping
the other dancers pushed down...

355
01:11:16,634 --> 01:11:21,435
So this-this could echo that.

356
01:11:26,171 --> 01:11:29,850
...on-on a slightly higher
point of elevation.

357
01:11:32,315 --> 01:11:36,956
If I stay close to the ground now, and go
straight into the jumps where you have them later

358
01:11:37,755 --> 01:11:42,041
Then that's more to the point.

359
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:46,617
The resistance is more emphatic.

360
01:11:46,619 --> 01:11:47,740
Right?

361
01:11:51,035 --> 01:11:56,057
I don't know how aware you are

362
01:11:56,059 --> 01:11:59,195
of what times we lived through
here 40 years ago.

363
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:03,707
Out of which
this piece was made.

364
01:12:05,275 --> 01:12:10,842
We learned a great cost through those
years, the value of the balance of things.

365
01:12:10,844 --> 01:12:15,961
Every arrow that flies
feels the pull of the earth.

366
01:12:15,963 --> 01:12:17,883
But we must aim upwards.

367
01:12:20,027 --> 01:12:21,755
We need to get you in the air.

368
01:12:39,612 --> 01:12:41,562
Leave her, leave her, leave her!

369
01:13:15,773 --> 01:13:17,052
I heard it. I hope...

370
01:13:26,685 --> 01:13:30,523
I'm looking for a dancer
from your company.

371
01:13:30,525 --> 01:13:32,157
Who are you looking for?

372
01:13:33,213 --> 01:13:34,813
You are Sara.

373
01:13:37,245 --> 01:13:40,411
Yes. May I help you?

374
01:13:40,413 --> 01:13:43,388
I am a friend from Patricia.

375
01:14:04,508 --> 01:14:06,683
I don't know what to make of
any of this.

376
01:14:06,685 --> 01:14:11,803
I know the kind of thing she was involved with, but I can't
see how any of this woud be happening inside the company.

377
01:14:11,805 --> 01:14:21,371
Well, she describes something like a revolutionary
organization and a crisis of leadership.

378
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:24,253
With Markos very ill...

379
01:14:26,014 --> 01:14:31,260
I live there. I have friends there.
I don't see any evidence of this at all.

380
01:14:31,262 --> 01:14:34,556
No one has ever approached me or any
of the other girls as far as I know.

381
01:14:34,558 --> 01:14:36,478
Well, read this.

382
01:14:37,277 --> 01:14:38,556
What is this?

383
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:40,414
This is Patricia's diary.

384
01:14:42,206 --> 01:14:46,364
Mother Markos, mother Meinhof

385
01:14:46,366 --> 01:14:49,948
The dance rehearsal,
polital action

386
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:54,654
these two areas in Patricia's
life were of equal importance.

387
01:14:55,518 --> 01:14:56,798
This is how transformation
happens.

388
01:14:58,559 --> 01:15:01,724
How delusion is made.

389
01:15:01,726 --> 01:15:05,758
Delusions are lies
that tell the truth.

390
01:15:07,134 --> 01:15:09,150
- This says "witches."
- Mmm.

391
01:15:10,367 --> 01:15:15,516
Maybe Patricia's fantasies
about witches

392
01:15:15,518 --> 01:15:20,766
they are her way of processing
some other form of intrigue.

393
01:15:23,518 --> 01:15:28,316
The company's a family. There's
a lot of love there.

394
01:15:28,318 --> 01:15:36,893
Love and manipulations, they share houses
very often. They're frequent bedfellows.

395
01:15:36,895 --> 01:15:38,654
Sorry, I don't see this.

396
01:15:43,262 --> 01:15:44,222
Eat.

397
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:47,294
Eat.

398
01:15:55,999 --> 01:15:56,959
Only...

399
01:15:58,783 --> 01:16:01,534
maybe the police,
they missed something.

400
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:10,141
Our Patricia, she did spoke of
whole hidden areas of the building.

401
01:16:10,143 --> 01:16:13,055
Actual rooms that are secret.

402
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:22,717
I don't want to be
disrespectful. I don't.

403
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:25,117
- But you're asking me and I'm telling you.
- Oh, please.

404
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:27,999
It's a dance company. We're not
talking about anything else.

405
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:33,597
Sara. Please, only look closer.

406
01:16:33,599 --> 01:16:34,878
Thank you for caring for
Patricia

407
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,576
but I hope
you don't come again.

408
01:16:58,143 --> 01:17:00,158
- Good night.
- Good night.

409
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,726
Sara, hurry up.

410
01:17:01,728 --> 01:17:04,064
I'm tired. I need the bathroom.

411
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,087
- Good night, Doll.
- Good night.

412
01:17:18,688 --> 01:17:20,543
She hasn't come back yet?

413
01:17:25,696 --> 01:17:27,200
Maybe she's seeing somebody.

414
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,246
<i>Part of the issue always is not being
able to see your body in the space.</i>

415
01:17:37,248 --> 01:17:41,598
<i>One angle in one mirror or
on film is not enough.</i>

416
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,927
<i>Movement is never mute. It is a
language.</i>

417
01:17:44,929 --> 01:17:51,934
<i>It's a series of energetic shapes written
in the air like words forming sentences.</i>

418
01:17:51,936 --> 01:17:53,216
Like poems.

419
01:17:54,432 --> 01:17:55,905
Like prayers.

420
01:17:58,912 --> 01:18:00,065
Spells?

421
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:08,735
When you jump it's not the height but
the space beneath you that matters.

422
01:18:08,737 --> 01:18:11,392
Every leap into the air
must be a <i>coup de foudre.</i>

423
01:18:16,385 --> 01:18:21,119
- I don't understand.
- A strike of lightning.

424
01:18:21,121 --> 01:18:23,137
A bolt of love, in fact.

425
01:18:26,017 --> 01:18:27,521
That's beautiful.

426
01:18:29,025 --> 01:18:34,783
There are two things that dance can
never be again: beautiful and cheerful.

427
01:18:34,785 --> 01:18:39,071
Today we need to break the nose
of every beautiful thing.

428
01:18:39,073 --> 01:18:42,817
And if you are going to be a
dancer you must learn French.

429
01:19:18,914 --> 01:19:25,087
When you dance the dance of another, you
make yourself in the image of its creator.

430
01:19:25,089 --> 01:19:28,095
You empty yourself so that her
work can live within you.

431
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:29,250
Do you understand?

432
01:19:30,338 --> 01:19:31,298
Yeah.

433
01:19:33,474 --> 01:19:40,160
You're in a company now. You have to find your right place.
You have to decide what you want to be for this company.

434
01:19:40,162 --> 01:19:47,360
Is it the head? The spine?
The sex? The heart?

435
01:19:47,362 --> 01:19:48,450
The hands.

436
01:19:50,626 --> 01:19:53,408
I want to be this
company's hands.

437
01:19:58,371 --> 01:20:02,977
Higher... Higher... Higher...

438
01:20:02,979 --> 01:20:06,624
Higher... Higher! Higher!

439
01:20:06,626 --> 01:20:07,874
Higher.

440
01:20:09,762 --> 01:20:12,769
<i>Higher! Higher!</i>

441
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:13,986
<i>Higher!</i>

442
01:20:19,203 --> 01:20:23,168
Higher. Higher! Higher!

443
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:26,786
Higher! Higher! Higher!

444
01:20:32,514 --> 01:20:35,553
Sometimes I only need
to be told twice.

445
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:39,555
55, 56, 57, 58, 59-

446
01:22:46,788 --> 01:22:49,444
60, 61, 62, 63.

447
01:22:58,821 --> 01:23:01,989
65, 64, 63, 62.

448
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:12,709
23, 22, 21.

449
01:23:25,669 --> 01:23:29,507
10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

450
01:23:29,509 --> 01:23:31,781
Two, one.

451
01:26:41,128 --> 01:26:50,726
Patricia wrote about three mothers, lost
in time, predating all Christian invention.

452
01:26:50,728 --> 01:26:59,398
Pre-god, pre-devil. Mother
Tenebrarum, Mother Lachrymarum

453
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,672
and Mother Suspiriorum.

454
01:27:03,209 --> 01:27:07,209
Darkness, Tears and Sighs.

455
01:27:08,104 --> 01:27:13,062
I saw images of that last night in
porcelain and these very fine things.

456
01:27:13,064 --> 01:27:14,504
You can tell they have money.

457
01:27:18,535 --> 01:27:23,815
Patricia said that Markos claims
to be one of the three.

458
01:27:23,817 --> 01:27:31,527
But there is disent amongst them. She
wrote about Markosites and Blancites.

459
01:27:31,529 --> 01:27:33,321
An internal division.

460
01:27:35,113 --> 01:27:37,065
Madame Blanc's
involved in this?

461
01:27:42,953 --> 01:27:44,745
Do they believe they're witches?

462
01:27:46,728 --> 01:27:52,263
You can give someone your
delusion, Sara.

463
01:27:52,265 --> 01:27:53,417
That's religion.

464
01:27:56,201 --> 01:27:57,705
That was the Reich.

465
01:27:59,177 --> 01:28:00,872
The Reich had these things.

466
01:28:02,536 --> 01:28:07,847
Insignia. Esoteric ritual.

467
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:17,449
These mothers, yeah, they could be codenames for founding
members with metaphoric histories, I don't know.

468
01:28:18,857 --> 01:28:22,057
But I do know you're living with
dangerous people.

469
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:25,864
Patricia could still be in-

470
01:28:25,866 --> 01:28:26,762
...in there.

471
01:28:31,049 --> 01:28:33,481
They could be holding her
in the building.

472
01:28:34,154 --> 01:28:41,288
Well, I can not promise that your searches will
come back to inspect a cabinet full of porcelain

473
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:46,376
after all that has happened.
But we can try.

474
01:28:46,378 --> 01:28:52,455
And in the meantime you must take care
of yourself. Perhaps you should leave.

475
01:28:52,457 --> 01:28:53,770
You have somewhere you can go?

476
01:28:55,787 --> 01:28:57,707
I'll figure it out.

477
01:28:58,377 --> 01:29:01,352
And I think you should
put this back.

478
01:29:01,354 --> 01:29:03,178
Or better still,
you leave it here.

479
01:29:05,194 --> 01:29:07,178
Not good for them
to know that you have it.

480
01:30:36,363 --> 01:30:43,179
Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the
elders of the church, and let them pray over him

481
01:30:43,467 --> 01:30:46,636
anointing him with oil
in the name of the Lord.

482
01:30:47,339 --> 01:30:52,170
And the prayer of faith shall
save him that is sick.

483
01:30:52,172 --> 01:30:59,115
And the Lord shall raise him up.
And if he has committed sins-

484
01:31:00,075 --> 01:31:01,707
My daughter.

485
01:31:04,555 --> 01:31:06,475
...they shall be forgiven him.

486
01:31:10,412 --> 01:31:12,204
My last one.

487
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:21,257
She's my sin... She's what I
smear on the world.

488
01:32:00,301 --> 01:32:02,412
You're making some kind
of deal with them.

489
01:32:03,949 --> 01:32:07,691
I don't know what you're
talking about.

490
01:32:07,693 --> 01:32:10,573
How can you know what they're
going to ask you in return?

491
01:32:10,861 --> 01:32:15,373
Sara, whatever you have in your
mind, nothing is wrong.

492
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:19,084
You just haven't
seen the bill yet.

493
01:32:20,429 --> 01:32:22,891
Nothing's wrong.

494
01:33:19,022 --> 01:33:20,844
What's the matter with you?

495
01:33:20,846 --> 01:33:22,510
Huh?

496
01:33:26,317 --> 01:33:31,276
You don't be so afraid about the
white, Susie.

497
01:33:31,278 --> 01:33:34,573
They need to see you
from the very back row.

498
01:33:42,541 --> 01:33:43,791
Where is Sara?

499
01:33:44,814 --> 01:33:47,724
She came early in the morning

500
01:33:47,726 --> 01:33:49,550
did her makeup and left.

501
01:34:38,703 --> 01:34:42,189
Girls, <i>Vier Minuten!</i>

502
01:34:42,191 --> 01:34:43,374
Four minutes!

503
01:34:46,254 --> 01:34:47,759
<i>Vier Minuten!</i>

504
01:35:32,751 --> 01:35:35,631
<i>Sara. Sara.</i>

505
01:35:36,847 --> 01:35:39,727
Patricia. Patricia.

506
01:35:40,816 --> 01:35:48,015
Patricia, I knew it! Sorry it
took me so long. I'm so sorry.

507
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:53,614
- What did they do to you?
- They would come here every day.

508
01:35:53,616 --> 01:35:55,343
It's all over now.
I'll get you out.

509
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,813
The performance is starting upstairs.
Everyone will be looking the other way.

510
01:36:00,815 --> 01:36:03,501
Get up. Get up.

511
01:36:03,503 --> 01:36:04,528
Patricia!

512
01:36:05,136 --> 01:36:06,639
Patricia, get up!

513
01:36:07,888 --> 01:36:09,136
Get up.

514
01:36:21,072 --> 01:36:22,575
Sara!

515
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,136
Sara!

516
01:36:56,881 --> 01:37:00,337
Markos! Markos! Markos! Markos!

517
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:23,152
Marketa, where is Sara?

518
01:37:24,081 --> 01:37:24,848
Sara!

519
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:26,575
- I don't know.
- Is she upstairs?

520
01:37:26,577 --> 01:37:27,982
No. I looked.

521
01:37:27,984 --> 01:37:29,937
Just dance
as if she's with you.

522
01:37:38,577 --> 01:37:39,890
<i>Sara!</i>

523
01:38:01,266 --> 01:38:02,224
Go.

524
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

525
01:39:51,668 --> 01:39:52,819
No.

526
01:39:55,059 --> 01:39:56,881
Sara, lie still.

527
01:39:56,883 --> 01:39:58,706
- No!
- Sara.

528
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:03,091
Please!

529
01:40:09,812 --> 01:40:12,500
No! No!

530
01:46:12,408 --> 01:46:14,232
I'm sorry I went off book.

531
01:46:20,345 --> 01:46:25,464
This can't happen
again. You're only just starting to understand, Susie.

532
01:46:26,777 --> 01:46:30,615
We brought Sara back upstairs to try
to complete the performance in time.

533
01:46:30,617 --> 01:46:35,383
- But then you derailed it.
- Did I hurt those people?

534
01:46:35,385 --> 01:46:38,487
Not this time.
They saw her dance.

535
01:46:38,489 --> 01:46:39,417
That's all.

536
01:46:41,402 --> 01:46:46,935
It's all a mess, isn't it?
The one out there...

537
01:46:46,937 --> 01:46:48,280
The one in here.

538
01:46:51,194 --> 01:46:52,632
The one that's coming.

539
01:46:56,825 --> 01:46:59,415
Why is everyone

540
01:46:59,417 --> 01:47:02,009
so ready to think
the worst is over?

541
01:47:20,346 --> 01:47:22,297
I could
explain everything to you.

542
01:47:24,569 --> 01:47:26,937
I think it would be wrong,
though.

543
01:48:02,778 --> 01:48:10,490
One, two, three, four...

544
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:31,451
<i>Herr Doktor.</i>

545
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

546
01:59:50,083 --> 01:59:51,397
I'm ready, Madame.

547
02:00:16,997 --> 02:00:18,211
You look afraid.

548
02:00:20,293 --> 02:00:22,117
She's afraid for you.

549
02:00:37,766 --> 02:00:43,716
There will be nothing of
you left inside.

550
02:00:45,254 --> 02:00:49,604
Only space... for me.

551
02:00:50,597 --> 02:00:52,677
I came here for this.

552
02:00:55,717 --> 02:00:57,509
You've all waited long enough.

553
02:00:59,461 --> 02:01:02,213
It is happening.

554
02:01:02,469 --> 02:01:05,381
It is happening!

555
02:01:46,438 --> 02:01:48,358
You come here.

556
02:01:50,439 --> 02:01:52,134
Hmm?

557
02:01:54,054 --> 02:02:00,518
You must have no doubts, Susie. If you do, I can take
you back. I can take all of this from your head.

558
02:02:00,998 --> 02:02:02,502
You can forget everything.

559
02:02:05,127 --> 02:02:07,237
I want this to be pure.

560
02:02:08,775 --> 02:02:12,676
We all know what you want.

561
02:02:16,647 --> 02:02:22,723
This isn't for vanity.
This isn't

562
02:02:22,725 --> 02:02:24,549
art!

563
02:02:26,311 --> 02:02:33,477
There's something wrong here. Can you not feel
it? This isn't right. We have to stop this now.

564
02:02:33,479 --> 02:02:39,878
We've been on two sides of this
for too long now.

565
02:03:24,808 --> 02:03:28,517
If you accept me

566
02:03:28,519 --> 02:03:33,352
you must put down
the woman who bore you.

567
02:03:35,784 --> 02:03:38,791
Think of that false mother now.

568
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:53,352
Reject her.

569
02:03:54,408 --> 02:03:56,232
Expel her.

570
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:09,320
You have the only mother you need here.
Death to any other mother. Say it.

571
02:04:10,696 --> 02:04:13,576
Death to any other mother.

572
02:04:43,848 --> 02:04:45,320
Who are you?

573
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:56,967
For whom were you anointed,
which of the three mothers?

574
02:04:56,969 --> 02:04:59,174
Mother death.

575
02:05:03,624 --> 02:05:06,505
Mother Suspiriorum.

576
02:05:09,193 --> 02:05:10,696
I am she.

577
02:05:48,714 --> 02:05:49,674
Markos.

578
02:06:03,978 --> 02:06:04,842
Markos!

579
02:06:39,626 --> 02:06:40,586
Markos!

580
02:06:42,826 --> 02:06:43,786
Markos.

581
02:06:50,602 --> 02:06:53,737
Death to any other mother.

582
02:06:53,739 --> 02:06:54,795
Markos.

583
02:07:01,642 --> 02:07:02,538
Markos!

584
02:07:14,187 --> 02:07:15,146
Markos!

585
02:07:22,603 --> 02:07:23,660
Markos!

- What do you ask?
- To die.

592
02:08:45,708 --> 02:08:47,147
Mother, we're so tired.

593
02:08:54,956 --> 02:08:59,306
- What do you ask?
- To die.

594
02:08:59,308 --> 02:09:00,556
I want to die.

595
02:09:09,996 --> 02:09:11,308
Sweet girl.

596
02:09:13,676 --> 02:09:15,116
What do you ask?

597
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:19,754

Dance. Dance. Keep dancing.

603
02:09:51,149 --> 02:09:52,557
It's beautiful.

604
02:09:53,900 --> 02:09:55,373
It's beautiful.

605
02:09:56,812 --> 02:09:58,700
It's beautiful.

606
02:11:24,205 --> 02:11:25,997
Good. Good.

607
02:13:16,848 --> 02:13:18,798
My god, what a night.

608
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:21,327
I definitely drank
too much wine.

609
02:13:40,176 --> 02:13:42,542
<i>Guten Morgen.</i>

610
02:13:42,544 --> 02:13:43,600
Good morning.

611
02:15:54,386 --> 02:15:56,850
I regret what my daughters
did to you.

612
02:15:59,154 --> 02:16:01,106
I wasn't in a position
to prevent it.

613
02:16:06,385 --> 02:16:08,627
I believe you deserve
to know the truth.

614
02:16:17,394 --> 02:16:22,128
Your wife did try to make it
south

615
02:16:22,130 --> 02:16:23,634
to Teplice.

616
02:16:25,299 --> 02:16:29,585
She was apprehended by border
guards

617
02:16:29,587 --> 02:16:32,531
in the woods
just outside of Glashütte.

618
02:16:35,698 --> 02:16:40,467
She was then taken
to Theresienstadt camp.

619
02:16:43,154 --> 02:16:45,395
She lived there for 20 days.

620
02:16:47,379 --> 02:16:52,433
On the 11th of November, 1943

621
02:16:52,435 --> 02:16:56,435
the commandant of the camp,
a man named Burger...

622
02:16:56,979 --> 02:17:00,753
ordered all 40,000
detained there

623
02:17:00,755 --> 02:17:05,267
stand outside in the cold
for a census.

624
02:17:11,187 --> 02:17:13,108
Hours and hours passed.

625
02:17:16,883 --> 02:17:18,835
Some hundreds died of exposure.

626
02:17:27,636 --> 02:17:30,131
Your wife had two women
with her as she died.

627
02:17:32,212 --> 02:17:36,082
Women she had befriended

628
02:17:36,084 --> 02:17:38,676
who made her feel
that she was not alone.

629
02:17:45,812 --> 02:17:55,411
Her final thoughts were of her birthday when
you took her to a concert as a surprise.

630
02:17:57,012 --> 02:17:59,697
Chopin and Brahms.

631
02:18:03,795 --> 02:18:05,844
It was the first time
you held her hand.

632
02:18:11,732 --> 02:18:14,388
She was cold when she died.

633
02:18:17,876 --> 02:18:19,188
But she wasn't afraid.

634
02:18:23,699 --> 02:18:25,748
She was thinking only of you.

635
02:18:44,468 --> 02:18:46,260
Of Anke Meier...

636
02:18:48,757 --> 02:18:50,228
...of Patricia Hingle...

637
02:18:51,956 --> 02:18:53,620
...of Sara Simms...

638
02:18:56,981 --> 02:19:00,819
...of Susanna Bannion...

639
02:19:00,821 --> 02:19:04,117
of all the women
of your undoing...

640
02:19:07,060 --> 02:19:09,684
...every memory will vanish.

641
02:19:13,301 --> 02:19:17,394
They will melt away in the sun

642
02:19:17,396 --> 02:19:18,485
and be gone.

643
02:19:49,237 --> 02:19:50,550
Herr Doctor.
