1
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,062
Game over.

2
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,634
I'll fuckin' kill you!

3
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:41,965
You fuckin' bitch!

4
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:44,472
You bitch!

5
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:48,300
I'll fuckin' kill you!

6
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,226
Daniel!

7
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:18,880
Secure the flank!
Left side clear?

8
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,413
We're clear!

9
00:05:20,515 --> 00:05:22,949
Left side's clear.
Let's move!

10
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,498
Oh, my God.

11
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,559
Someone call Kerry.

12
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,470
The call came in at 11:45.
The woman heard an explosion.

13
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:46,905
The fire department was
the first on the scene.

14
00:05:47,008 --> 00:05:48,100
Kerry.

15
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,440
- Is it him?
- Before you go in there--

16
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:52,672
Eric. Is it him?

17
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:53,975
We don't know yet.

18
00:06:02,491 --> 00:06:04,186
It's not Detective Matthews.

19
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:18,906
What happened?

20
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:22,408
The victim was held
in place by these chains.

21
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:04,943
Hello, Troy.

22
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:07,578
I wanna play a game.

23
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:09,953
This game will take place
in a room not much bigger

24
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:12,788
than the room you've
spent most of your life in.

25
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:14,521
A prison cell.

26
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:17,063
Despite all of the advantages
and privileges

27
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:18,792
that you were given at birth,

28
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,098
you have returned
to prison again and again.

29
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:26,504
More comfortable in chains
than you are in freedom.

30
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:30,135
Tonight we will see how
far you are willing to go

31
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:32,770
to break those chains
once and for all.

32
00:07:32,881 --> 00:07:34,371
Live or die, Troy.

33
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:36,609
Make your choice.

34
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:58,004
This was the bomb.

35
00:07:58,106 --> 00:08:03,669
All he had to do was release himself
from each of the chains...

36
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:07,737
walk out the door before it went off.

37
00:08:09,784 --> 00:08:11,411
All he had to do?

38
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:57,795
Oh, God.

39
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:36,301
Fuck! Fuck!

40
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:55,955
I really had this feeling
it was going to be him.

41
00:09:56,057 --> 00:10:01,461
Kerry, Eric is a missing persons case,
not a homicide case.

42
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:07,190
I've been having nightmares
where I see him.

43
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:14,974
I'm never going to be able
to forgive myself for what happened.

44
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:17,476
Listen.
It's not your fault.

45
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:18,876
It's always somebody's fault.

46
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,447
That somebody isn't you.

47
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:22,812
That someone is still out there.

48
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:26,819
Put all your anger into finding them
and putting them away.

49
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:28,218
All right?

50
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,991
What I don't understand is

51
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:33,651
how the hell could Jigsaw
do all of this?

52
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:36,390
He was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him.

53
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:40,529
I'm not so sure he did.

54
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:42,899
So far this doesn't follow
any of his patterns.

55
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:44,335
Meaning?

56
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:47,101
Well... how'd you get in here?

57
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,472
- We cut the door down.
- Why?

58
00:10:49,577 --> 00:10:52,637
Because somebody heard
an explosion and called us.

59
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:55,045
I mean, why did you
have to cut the door down?

60
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,879
It was welded shut.

61
00:10:56,985 --> 00:10:58,350
Bloody truck couldn't get in here.

62
00:10:58,453 --> 00:10:59,715
Exactly.

63
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:01,789
I don't follow.

64
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,256
If the aim of Jigsaw's game was
to get out before the bomb went off,

65
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,122
then why was the door
welded shut?

66
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:08,525
The guy couldn't get out if he wanted to.

67
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,827
You won't believe this.
We got the tape out clean.

68
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

69
00:12:04,185 --> 00:12:07,382
Hello, Troy.
I wanna play a game.

70
00:12:09,657 --> 00:12:13,149
Live or die, Troy.
Make your choice.

71
00:14:12,313 --> 00:14:13,337
Hello, Kerry.

72
00:14:14,816 --> 00:14:16,306
I want to play a game.

73
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:20,683
Up until now you have spent
your life among the dead

74
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:22,380
piecing together
their final moments.

75
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,789
You are good at this because you,
like them,

76
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:27,190
are also dead.

77
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:29,957
Dead on the inside.

78
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:34,228
You identify more
with a cold corpse

79
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:36,235
than you do
with a living human.

80
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:39,465
I believe you want
to join your true family,

81
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:42,668
indeed, your only family,
in death.

82
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:45,739
The device you are wearing

83
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:48,441
is hooked into your ribcage.

84
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:50,608
And by the time
this tape is finished,

85
00:14:50,718 --> 00:14:53,915
you will have one minute
to find a way out.

86
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:57,389
At the end of that minute,
you should know

87
00:14:57,492 --> 00:15:00,586
better than anyone
what happens then.

88
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:03,789
There is a simple key
that will unlock the harness, Kerry.

89
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:05,456
It is right in front of you.

90
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:09,332
All you have to do is
reach in and take it.

91
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:12,028
But do it quickly.

92
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,168
The acid will dissolve the key
in a matter of seconds.

93
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:19,644
Make your choice.

94
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:54,767
You.

95
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:36,343
I gotta be at the hospital by 9.

96
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:41,454
It's Tuesday.
I thought you started at 11.

97
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:45,390
Yeah, well, they change
things on me last minute.

98
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:46,983
Well, you better head off, then.

99
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:55,895
You're not gonna take a shower?

100
00:17:57,371 --> 00:18:01,705
Nah. I'm just gonna take
a shower at the hospital.

101
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:06,542
Can we just...
talk for five minutes?

102
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:10,515
How about we just make eye contact
for five seconds?

103
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:11,710
What's wrong?

104
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:16,984
Nothing.
Just... everything.

105
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,218
Lynn.

106
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:23,058
What is it you want from me, Chris?

107
00:18:25,032 --> 00:18:26,021
A divorce.

108
00:18:35,376 --> 00:18:36,365
MPA.

109
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,507
Car skidded into oncoming traffic.

110
00:18:41,082 --> 00:18:41,980
Pressure?

111
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,277
80 over, palp.
Pulse is thready.

112
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:45,215
Ready? 1, 2, 3.

113
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:48,049
- Where's Lynn?
- Page Dr. Denlon.

114
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:49,053
Set up an art-line.

115
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:50,123
Dr. Lynn Denlon,

116
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:51,555
please report
to trauma immediately.

117
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:54,527
Dr. Lynn Denlon, please
report to trauma immediately.

118
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,397
Lynn!

119
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:01,164
Check this out.
Hermaphony.

120
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:04,329
Pressure down to 70.
He's going into shock.

121
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:06,429
Get an OR ready.
We gotta crack his chest.

122
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,133
Do we get a bolus?
500 wide open?

123
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:09,209
No.

124
00:19:10,878 --> 00:19:12,470
What?

125
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,777
- No air entry on the right side.
- And?

126
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:19,750
Let's get a chest tube in him.

127
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:22,789
We gotta get him to OR now.

128
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,790
His stats are dropping.
He's gonna code.

129
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:28,328
I'm doin' it.

130
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:40,364
I'm getting a rush of air.

131
00:19:40,474 --> 00:19:43,500
Stats are improving.
Pressure back to 80.

132
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:46,079
Pressure normal.

133
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,761
If you got something on your mind,
go upstairs to psych.

134
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:06,492
Just don't bring it in here.

135
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:08,228
We don't have any seconds to spare, Lynn.

136
00:20:08,336 --> 00:20:10,930
The woman standing in front of me
had to be dragged

137
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:13,871
from the locker room
to put a chest tube in a trauma patient?

138
00:20:13,975 --> 00:20:15,909
Lynn Denlon should have been
the first one there.

139
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:20,681
Lynn.

140
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:22,683
Lynn!

141
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:58,014
What the hell?

142
00:20:58,552 --> 00:20:59,849
I'm locked in!

143
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:01,945
Is anybody there?

144
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:03,284
Hello?

145
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:13,026
Anybody here?

146
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

147
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:40,282
Help! Help me!

148
00:22:42,823 --> 00:22:44,723
Help!

149
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,125
Who are you?
Who are you?

150
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:54,030
What is this?

151
00:22:56,337 --> 00:23:00,068
What are you doing?

152
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,141
Are you gonna behave?

153
00:23:13,988 --> 00:23:15,353
Let's go.

154
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:20,086
What is this place?
What is this place?

155
00:23:29,203 --> 00:23:31,899
What is... this place?

156
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:41,641
Who are you?
Who are you?

157
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,178
Hello, Dr. Denlon.

158
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:53,022
You may not remember me,
but I most certainly remember you.

159
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:58,690
I was a guest at your hospital once.

160
00:24:01,902 --> 00:24:02,869
Where am I?

161
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,040
Do you remember me?

162
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:18,848
I've seen you on television.

163
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:23,122
Lawrence Gordon was your doctor.

164
00:24:23,224 --> 00:24:26,716
I was his patient,
and he was mine.

165
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:29,992
As you can see from that report,

166
00:24:30,097 --> 00:24:31,962
my prognosis isn't good.

167
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:35,726
Would you agree?

168
00:24:42,643 --> 00:24:45,043
There's no preventative treatment
for what you have.

169
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:48,114
I remember you saying that
to me once before

170
00:24:48,215 --> 00:24:50,775
in almost the exact same tone.

171
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:54,548
Leave it to a doctor to find such a cold,
clinical way

172
00:24:54,655 --> 00:24:57,749
of saying I'm a dead man walking.

173
00:24:57,858 --> 00:25:00,520
Looking at me,
how long would you say I have left?

174
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:03,756
I'd have to examine you.

175
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:06,731
Even then,
a frontal lobe tumor is unpredictable.

176
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:10,235
The growth depends on the rate of mitosis
versus apoptosis--

177
00:25:10,337 --> 00:25:14,774
I'm sorry, but there's all this crude
medical equipment around me

178
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:18,333
causing you to believe
that you're still inside a hospital.

179
00:25:18,445 --> 00:25:19,742
No.

180
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:21,314
Then why are you speaking to me

181
00:25:21,415 --> 00:25:24,475
in that graduate school
medical jargon?

182
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:27,952
Look at me!

183
00:25:30,524 --> 00:25:32,355
Now, you look at me.

184
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:34,984
I asked you a simple question.

185
00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:36,824
Based on your experience,

186
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:40,458
how long do you think I have left?

187
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:42,694
It's not a simple answer.

188
00:25:42,803 --> 00:25:47,763
Based on your file,
I'd say... not long.

189
00:25:56,383 --> 00:25:58,578
Death is a surprise party.

190
00:25:58,686 --> 00:26:04,420
Unless, of course,
you're already dead on the inside.

191
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:09,185
Unless you're the type of person

192
00:26:09,296 --> 00:26:13,164
who swallows antidepressants
to hide the pain, huh?

193
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:15,428
Turns their back on their husband.

194
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:17,595
Neglects their child.

195
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:20,265
Who has every possible
advantage in life

196
00:26:20,374 --> 00:26:22,842
but chooses not to advance.

197
00:26:22,943 --> 00:26:24,843
What do you want from me?

198
00:26:26,413 --> 00:26:28,176
What do I want?

199
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:31,683
I want to play a game.

200
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:38,647
The rules of the game are simple.

201
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:42,354
The consequences
for breaking them are great.

202
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:43,430
Death.

203
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:48,695
You're being tested.
Your will is being tested.

204
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:50,736
Your will to keep someone alive.

205
00:26:50,838 --> 00:26:51,998
Can you do that?

206
00:26:52,106 --> 00:26:54,836
Can you follow the rules
and grant someone the gift of life?

207
00:26:54,942 --> 00:26:57,877
What is this?
No! Get it--

208
00:26:57,978 --> 00:27:03,507
No! No! What is this!
What are you doing to me?

209
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:13,350
The device that you're wearing
is linked to my heart rate monitor.

210
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,261
The second that heart rate monitor flatlines
or you move out of range,

211
00:27:18,365 --> 00:27:21,232
an explosion will go off in that collar.

212
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:25,738
Your life and my life
will end simultaneously.

213
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:29,033
Please.
Please don't do this to me.

214
00:27:29,143 --> 00:27:31,976
I have a family.
I have a family.

215
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,445
Let me give you
the simple version.

216
00:27:35,983 --> 00:27:39,612
You will keep him alive,
whatever it takes.

217
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,248
No excuses.
No equivocations.

218
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:46,155
No crying.

219
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,990
What do you mean,
keep him alive?

220
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:56,633
Out there, on those screens,
we have another test subject.

221
00:27:56,737 --> 00:27:58,796
A man.

222
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:04,738
He will face a series of tests.

223
00:28:04,845 --> 00:28:10,044
You have to keep John alive
until he makes it through.

224
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:15,146
If he completes all of his tests
and John is still breathing,

225
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:17,815
then I will remove your collar...

226
00:28:19,693 --> 00:28:21,354
and you're free to go.

227
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:25,120
You're a vital piece
of my puzzle, Dr. Denlon.

228
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:28,998
A critical part of what could be
my final test.

229
00:28:30,804 --> 00:28:34,604
Amanda,
it's time to start our game.

230
00:29:05,606 --> 00:29:06,937
Help!

231
00:29:13,413 --> 00:29:14,380
Hello!

232
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:19,219
Is there anybody out there?

233
00:29:28,962 --> 00:29:31,226
Hello, Jeff.

234
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:32,958
Over the past few years,

235
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:36,001
you have become a shell
of your former self...

236
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:39,300
consumed with hatred
and vengeance.

237
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:43,206
Vengeance against the drunk driver
who killed your only son.

238
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:48,646
Vengeance against the killer,
who to your surprise and dismay,

239
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:52,947
was set free after a hasty trial.

240
00:29:53,053 --> 00:29:57,353
Today, however,
it is you who will be put on trial.

241
00:29:57,457 --> 00:30:02,394
To escape from where you are,
you will have to face a series of tests.

242
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:06,796
You will have to suffer
to move forward through each of them.

243
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,166
But with each one,
you will also have a chance...

244
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:14,399
a chance to forgive.

245
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:15,770
When you complete the tests,

246
00:30:15,876 --> 00:30:19,312
I promise you
you will finally come face to face

247
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:22,314
with the man responsible
for the loss of your child.

248
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:25,476
That will be your ultimate test.

249
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:28,146
Can you forgive him?

250
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,782
You better hurry, though.

251
00:30:30,891 --> 00:30:34,122
In two hours, the doors will lock,

252
00:30:34,228 --> 00:30:37,391
and this place
will become your tomb.

253
00:30:37,497 --> 00:30:41,024
This is what you've
been waiting for, Jeff.

254
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:42,726
Let the game begin.

255
00:30:42,836 --> 00:30:44,736
Help!

256
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:13,958
You fucking killed my son.

257
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:16,797
Don't you fuckin' beg.

258
00:31:16,903 --> 00:31:21,033
Do you know who I am?

259
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,137
I'll fuckin' teach you,
you motherfucker.

260
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:36,815
This is what you fuckin' deserve.

261
00:31:57,878 --> 00:31:59,402
Where is it?

262
00:31:59,513 --> 00:32:01,140
What?

263
00:32:03,216 --> 00:32:04,410
Where is it?

264
00:32:11,925 --> 00:32:13,324
How many times?

265
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:16,557
How many times
do I have to tell you

266
00:32:16,663 --> 00:32:18,096
before you get it in your head?

267
00:32:18,198 --> 00:32:20,996
I just wanted
to sleep with something.

268
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:23,001
No. No. You just-- nothin'.

269
00:32:23,103 --> 00:32:28,063
You don't... touch things in Dylan's room.

270
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:32,867
Okay?

271
00:33:23,797 --> 00:33:24,991
I'm sorry, Daddy.

272
00:33:34,074 --> 00:33:35,666
You know I love you, don't you?

273
00:33:39,446 --> 00:33:43,473
What do you think Mommy would say
if she saw us like this?

274
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,988
I'm gonna go get ready for school.

275
00:34:11,978 --> 00:34:12,967
Daddy!

276
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:33,325
Hello?

277
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:41,004
Hello?

278
00:34:57,057 --> 00:34:58,854
Hey!

279
00:36:15,268 --> 00:36:17,463
All right, John.
I need you to look at my nose.

280
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:18,629
Right here.

281
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:22,267
Look at my nose, please?

282
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:25,037
Follow my flashlight.

283
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:34,211
Tell me if you feel any pain, all right?

284
00:36:35,322 --> 00:36:36,289
That hurt?

285
00:36:42,295 --> 00:36:43,819
It's begun.

286
00:36:45,498 --> 00:36:47,125
He's out of the box.

287
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,028
So?

288
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:58,043
My 20-second analysis
without any medical equipment

289
00:36:58,144 --> 00:36:59,509
is that his brain's herniating.

290
00:37:01,715 --> 00:37:05,048
He needs to go to the hospital
and have an operation

291
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:07,016
to decompress his brain.

292
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come here.
- No, really. Come here.
- What?
- Come here.
- No.
- Let me ask you something.
- Oh, God!

293
00:37:15,662 --> 00:37:18,358
Did I bring John to you...

294
00:37:18,465 --> 00:37:22,094
or did I bring your self-centered ass to him?

295
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:25,968
You better start
fuckin' paying attention.

296
00:37:26,072 --> 00:37:29,041
No one's going to any hospital.

297
00:37:31,878 --> 00:37:33,311
I can't perform miracles.

298
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:35,244
You're-- You're giving him painkillers.

299
00:37:35,348 --> 00:37:37,543
For a tumor like this,
he needs steroids, Prednisone.

300
00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:38,640
Oh, good. Yeah.

301
00:37:38,752 --> 00:37:40,549
Maybe we could try
some corticoid steroids,

302
00:37:40,654 --> 00:37:42,519
you know,
like Dexamethasone.

303
00:37:42,622 --> 00:37:44,954
Why don't you fuckin' tell me something
that I don't know,

304
00:37:45,058 --> 00:37:47,549
you stupid cunt?

305
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:52,394
The only place that he can get
those drugs is in a hospital.

306
00:37:54,868 --> 00:37:56,199
Or else he's gonna die.

307
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:01,907
You are not a good listener.

308
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:05,500
I think you missed the part
that if he dies...

309
00:38:06,646 --> 00:38:08,204
you die.

310
00:38:08,314 --> 00:38:11,340
You're asking me
to do the impossible.

311
00:38:11,451 --> 00:38:14,750
I'm not asking you. He is.

312
00:38:14,854 --> 00:38:17,254
He chose you.

313
00:38:20,226 --> 00:38:21,989
- Not me.
- Amanda!

314
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:26,730
Our doctor can't do
what's being asked of her

315
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:28,892
if you're threatening her.

316
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:32,802
The rules of our game
have been made very clear.

317
00:38:32,906 --> 00:38:36,069
You need to abide by those rules.

318
00:38:36,176 --> 00:38:37,143
Sorry.

319
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,093
Amanda!
Amanda, I need your help!

320
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,725
Amanda, he needs oxygen!

321
00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:04,929
Oxygen, Amanda!

322
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:06,471
Put the mask on his face.

323
00:39:11,077 --> 00:39:12,408
Okay, now hold him down.

324
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,980
Tip his head to the side.
You got it?

325
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:34,361
What are you doing?

326
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:37,231
Ativan!
Do you have Ativan?

327
00:39:37,337 --> 00:39:38,565
No!

328
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,407
Back off! Back off!

329
00:39:41,508 --> 00:39:43,135
Back off! Back off!

330
00:39:45,612 --> 00:39:46,977
Stay with me, John.

331
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,014
You're almost through this.
Stay with me.

332
00:39:53,887 --> 00:39:56,219
Stay with me.
We're almost done with this.

333
00:40:21,014 --> 00:40:22,709
Was that enough for you?

334
00:40:22,816 --> 00:40:24,613
Are you ready to go
to the hospital now?

335
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,357
He needs to have an operation.

336
00:40:31,457 --> 00:40:34,051
- Okay.
- Okay.

337
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,355
But we do it here.

338
00:40:36,462 --> 00:40:38,089
- We do it here.
- What?

339
00:40:38,198 --> 00:40:40,189
What do you need?

340
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,791
I need anesthetic
for a procedure like this.

341
00:40:42,902 --> 00:40:43,926
Anesthetic.
What else?

342
00:40:44,037 --> 00:40:45,527
Even with an anesthetic--

343
00:40:45,638 --> 00:40:47,299
Anesthetic!
What else?

344
00:40:50,376 --> 00:40:51,843
A power drill.

345
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:42,247
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

346
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:48,559
Please, please.
Let me go.

347
00:42:48,661 --> 00:42:53,291
Please. Why... Why are you
doing this to me?

348
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:57,028
Don't... Don't kill me.
Okay? Please!

349
00:42:57,136 --> 00:42:58,660
Wait. The key. Key.

350
00:42:58,771 --> 00:43:01,501
Key. Okay.
Come on.

351
00:43:01,607 --> 00:43:02,699
Fuck!

352
00:43:03,743 --> 00:43:05,472
Fuck!

353
00:43:06,913 --> 00:43:11,612
Please. I'm so cold.
I can't feel my arms.

354
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,556
Welcome to your first test, Jeff.

355
00:43:21,661 --> 00:43:24,858
For the past three years,
you've cursed the name

356
00:43:24,964 --> 00:43:26,932
of all those you thought
were responsible

357
00:43:27,033 --> 00:43:29,433
for the death of your son.

358
00:43:29,535 --> 00:43:33,665
You fantasize those accountable will pay.

359
00:43:33,773 --> 00:43:37,641
Well, you will find a woman in front of you
chained in place.

360
00:43:37,744 --> 00:43:39,837
This will prevent her from running...

361
00:43:39,946 --> 00:43:43,177
much like she did
on the day your son was hit.

362
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,347
Her name is Danica Scott.

363
00:43:49,455 --> 00:43:51,013
She was the only witness present

364
00:43:51,124 --> 00:43:53,888
at the scene
of your son's untimely demise.

365
00:44:00,533 --> 00:44:04,333
If not for her own self-absorption
and cowardice,

366
00:44:04,437 --> 00:44:08,840
she could have brought
your son's killer to justice.

367
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:13,344
Now it is you who has a chance
to bring her to justice.

368
00:44:14,247 --> 00:44:19,651
You alone can grant her the gift of life
before she freezes to death.

369
00:44:19,752 --> 00:44:22,186
Behind the pipes
on the back wall

370
00:44:22,288 --> 00:44:25,052
you will find the key that
will free her and bring you

371
00:44:25,158 --> 00:44:26,557
one step closer to the man

372
00:44:26,659 --> 00:44:29,321
responsible for the loss
of your child.

373
00:44:30,263 --> 00:44:33,562
Will you claim the key
to save only yourself?

374
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:35,293
Help me!

375
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:39,064
Or can you find it within you
to save another?

376
00:44:39,472 --> 00:44:41,702
Make your choice.

377
00:45:10,503 --> 00:45:12,630
I didn't do anything.

378
00:45:14,207 --> 00:45:16,266
I didn't do anything to you!

379
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:19,003
That's exactly it.
You didn't do anything.

380
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,208
I'm fucking... dying.

381
00:45:24,317 --> 00:45:25,648
He died!

382
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,412
In my arms.

383
00:45:29,555 --> 00:45:33,548
My eight-year-old son
died in my arms.

384
00:46:01,053 --> 00:46:04,648
I made a m-m-mistake.

385
00:46:05,691 --> 00:46:07,454
I'm so sorry.

386
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,425
I'm human.

387
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:12,987
I'm human,
just like your son was. Okay?

388
00:46:16,269 --> 00:46:17,236
Look at me.

389
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:21,035
I said, look at me.
Look...

390
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:25,837
Oh, my God.

391
00:46:25,945 --> 00:46:27,037
Oh, my God.

392
00:46:27,146 --> 00:46:29,307
It's so cold.

393
00:47:46,459 --> 00:47:48,518
Oh, God!

394
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

395
00:49:49,482 --> 00:49:53,384
Amanda, if you really care about John,

396
00:49:53,486 --> 00:49:55,351
you won't let me do this to him.

397
00:49:55,454 --> 00:49:56,682
You're a smart woman,

398
00:49:56,789 --> 00:49:58,017
and you know what's right for him.

399
00:49:58,124 --> 00:49:59,182
I'm sorry.

400
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:01,020
I know it's hard to concentrate

401
00:50:01,127 --> 00:50:03,857
when you're surrounded by so many things
you could kill me with,

402
00:50:03,963 --> 00:50:06,397
like this ax I saw you lookin' at.

403
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,358
Take it.

404
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:11,231
Please, it's yours.

405
00:50:12,271 --> 00:50:13,260
Come on.

406
00:50:15,241 --> 00:50:16,367
I'd go for the neck,

407
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:18,636
but I'm not the brain surgeon.

408
00:50:18,744 --> 00:50:21,212
Just do it quietly
so John doesn't hear me die.

409
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:22,780
Otherwise he's likely
to get upset,

410
00:50:22,882 --> 00:50:24,474
rip off his heart rate monitor.

411
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:25,413
Boom.

412
00:50:25,518 --> 00:50:28,487
Then you just have to
find the sensor and disarm it

413
00:50:28,587 --> 00:50:30,987
so you can walk more
than 30 feet out that door

414
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,081
without the collar detonating.

415
00:50:33,192 --> 00:50:36,650
Or you could try and take
the collar off yourself.

416
00:50:36,762 --> 00:50:38,024
But that could be tricky.

417
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:41,566
The slightest knock
in the wrong place could trigger it.

418
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:42,656
I should know.

419
00:50:46,272 --> 00:50:47,239
I built it.

420
00:50:51,076 --> 00:50:55,376
So, do you have
everything you need?

421
00:50:56,782 --> 00:50:58,943
I have the instruments
to cut someone open.

422
00:50:59,051 --> 00:51:02,851
I don't have the tools
to save a life.

423
00:51:02,955 --> 00:51:05,753
You'd be surprised
what tools can save a life.

424
00:51:52,805 --> 00:51:54,796
Hello, Amanda.

425
00:51:54,907 --> 00:51:58,468
You don't know me, but...
I know you.

426
00:52:00,346 --> 00:52:01,745
I want to play a game.

427
00:52:04,216 --> 00:52:07,151
There is only one key
to open the device.

428
00:52:11,323 --> 00:52:13,621
It's in the stomach
of your dead cellmate.

429
00:52:19,031 --> 00:52:20,157
Look around, Amanda.

430
00:52:20,266 --> 00:52:23,599
Know that I'm not playing.

431
00:52:23,702 --> 00:52:25,636
Live or die.

432
00:52:25,738 --> 00:52:27,603
Make your choice.

433
00:52:33,812 --> 00:52:35,404
Congratulations.

434
00:52:35,514 --> 00:52:37,311
You are still alive.

435
00:52:38,217 --> 00:52:42,551
Most people are so ungrateful
to be alive,

436
00:52:42,655 --> 00:52:46,352
but not you, not anymore.

437
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:50,724
Amanda, do not be afraid.

438
00:52:50,829 --> 00:52:52,956
Your life has just begun.

439
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:13,351
He made it through
the freezer room.

440
00:53:16,689 --> 00:53:18,316
He tried to save her.

441
00:53:29,702 --> 00:53:37,234
There are some things
I need you to do for me.

442
00:53:37,343 --> 00:53:42,280
In my desk...
in the center drawer,

443
00:53:42,381 --> 00:53:44,281
an envelope...

444
00:53:44,383 --> 00:53:46,510
with your name on it.

445
00:53:50,389 --> 00:53:53,790
She's gonna do a procedure on you.

446
00:53:53,892 --> 00:53:55,291
Yeah.

447
00:53:55,394 --> 00:53:56,861
To relieve the pressure
on your brain.

448
00:53:56,962 --> 00:53:57,860
Yeah.

449
00:53:57,963 --> 00:53:59,863
And help with the headaches.

450
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:10,299
I can't do this.

451
00:54:10,409 --> 00:54:12,639
Amanda... you can.

452
00:54:12,745 --> 00:54:14,679
You can.

453
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,372
You're stronger now.

454
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:21,075
And I believe in you.

455
00:54:26,258 --> 00:54:28,818
You chose her 'cause
she's the best, right?

456
00:54:30,929 --> 00:54:33,056
That's one reason I chose her.

457
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:25,335
Damn it!

458
00:56:25,444 --> 00:56:27,503
Hello?

459
00:56:27,613 --> 00:56:29,740
Help me, please!

460
00:56:33,485 --> 00:56:35,248
Please, help me!

461
00:56:38,157 --> 00:56:40,125
I'm in here!

462
00:56:42,995 --> 00:56:44,792
Please get me out of here.

463
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:47,832
Help me. I--

464
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,562
Hello?

465
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,964
I know you're there.

466
00:56:56,074 --> 00:56:58,804
Please!
Please help me!

467
00:57:02,648 --> 00:57:06,175
I-- I can hear you.
Please, answer me!

468
00:57:06,285 --> 00:57:08,048
Help me!

469
00:57:10,489 --> 00:57:11,751
Please!

470
00:57:12,457 --> 00:57:14,186
Help me.

471
00:57:17,062 --> 00:57:19,053
Get me out of here, please.

472
00:57:19,164 --> 00:57:20,131
Please help me.

473
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:21,699
Get me out of here!

474
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,789
Please!

475
00:57:24,169 --> 00:57:25,261
Don't just stand there!

476
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:26,769
Help me!

477
00:57:30,976 --> 00:57:34,434
Jeff, when the judge
presiding over your case

478
00:57:34,546 --> 00:57:37,947
sentenced your boy's
murderer so lightly,

479
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:40,018
your soul never recovered.

480
00:57:40,118 --> 00:57:44,521
Now you have the power to sentence
his soul straight to Hell.

481
00:57:44,623 --> 00:57:46,784
Or you can forgive.

482
00:57:46,892 --> 00:57:51,795
The key that will free him
is hidden inside your son's possessions--

483
00:57:51,897 --> 00:57:55,264
Possessions you have clung to
for far too long.

484
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:59,963
Now, if you flip the switch
on the incinerator underneath you,

485
00:58:00,072 --> 00:58:02,438
a fire will cleanse you
of this obsession

486
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:04,133
and destroy them all,

487
00:58:04,243 --> 00:58:06,803
leaving only the key remaining.

488
00:58:06,912 --> 00:58:08,846
It is also the key
that will bring you closer

489
00:58:08,947 --> 00:58:12,474
to the man accountable
for taking your child.

490
00:58:12,584 --> 00:58:14,814
He doesn't have much time, Jeff.

491
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,852
Let the game begin.

492
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:16,852
Please, get me out of here.

493
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:18,513
Please!

494
00:58:22,427 --> 00:58:24,054
What is that?

495
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:31,395
What's that sound?

496
00:59:10,642 --> 00:59:13,543
I'm a criminal court judge,
for Christ's sake!

497
00:59:13,645 --> 00:59:14,771
You can't do this to me!

498
00:59:17,316 --> 00:59:18,476
You don't remember me?

499
00:59:22,988 --> 00:59:25,456
Well, maybe you remember
Timothy Young?

500
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:35,864
He was the driver
who killed my son.

501
00:59:35,968 --> 00:59:38,095
You gave him six months!

502
00:59:38,804 --> 00:59:40,601
Okay. All right.

503
00:59:40,706 --> 00:59:41,934
We can talk about your case.

504
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,270
Obviously you want answers.

505
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:46,469
I can't give them to you like this.

506
00:59:47,479 --> 00:59:48,639
This hurts!

507
00:59:50,248 --> 00:59:52,443
You gave more for
fuckin' parking tickets!

508
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:53,711
Listen to me.

509
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:57,118
I can see that you're
in a great deal of pain,

510
00:59:57,222 --> 01:00:00,419
but there are ways that we can have
his sentence extended.

511
01:00:00,525 --> 01:00:01,719
I can help you!

512
01:00:01,827 --> 01:00:04,022
It's too late!

513
01:00:04,129 --> 01:00:06,097
They let him go!

514
01:00:06,198 --> 01:00:07,961
Don't become what he is!

515
01:00:09,534 --> 01:00:11,434
Don't become a killer!

516
01:00:11,536 --> 01:00:14,664
Please!
I have a son, too.

517
01:00:23,648 --> 01:00:24,910
Where are you going?

518
01:00:26,918 --> 01:00:29,443
You gotta help me!

519
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:35,617
I'm so sorry!

520
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:41,964
Oh, God.

521
01:00:43,402 --> 01:00:45,029
You're killing me!

522
01:00:46,905 --> 01:00:50,204
Don't do this to me!
I'm gonna die!

523
01:00:56,915 --> 01:00:57,711
Fuck you!

524
01:00:59,217 --> 01:01:00,844
Fuck you, you--

525
01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:02,513
You gotta help me!

526
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:04,054
Shut the fuck up.

527
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:27,638
Help!

528
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:45,781
Come on!

529
01:03:38,376 --> 01:03:41,834
He made it through
the second test.

530
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:45,212
The judge is alive.

531
01:03:45,317 --> 01:03:46,875
Faster than I expected.

532
01:03:46,985 --> 01:03:50,011
All right, John, I need you
to keep your head to the side

533
01:03:50,121 --> 01:03:52,112
and keep still.

534
01:03:52,224 --> 01:03:54,055
What's goin' on here
is that your brain

535
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:55,786
is pushing
against your skull.

536
01:03:55,894 --> 01:03:58,727
I'm gonna try
to relieve the pressure

537
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:00,457
by cutting away
a little bit of your skull.

538
01:04:00,565 --> 01:04:03,125
It should help you
with your headaches

539
01:04:03,235 --> 01:04:05,726
and drastically improve
your motor skills.

540
01:04:05,837 --> 01:04:06,963
Do you understand?

541
01:04:07,072 --> 01:04:10,337
All too well.

542
01:04:18,683 --> 01:04:22,585
All right, you're gonna feel
some slight discomfort.

543
01:04:22,687 --> 01:04:24,848
Are you gonna give him
a general anesthetic?

544
01:04:24,956 --> 01:04:26,446
For a procedure like this,

545
01:04:26,558 --> 01:04:28,526
the patient needs to be
fully alert.

546
01:04:36,735 --> 01:04:38,066
Okay.

547
01:05:18,109 --> 01:05:19,736
Amanda, I need you here.

548
01:05:21,479 --> 01:05:22,468
Amanda.

549
01:05:24,616 --> 01:05:29,383
All right, John,
you're gonna feel some pressure.

550
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:42,529
Let's clamp this.
Stop the bleeding.

551
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,741
Fill that syringe
with alcohol from that bowl.

552
01:06:03,188 --> 01:06:04,382
Hurry.

553
01:06:13,498 --> 01:06:16,092
All right, John,
I need you to keep your mouth closed.

554
01:06:16,201 --> 01:06:17,998
You're gonna hear
a lot of noise.

555
01:07:17,095 --> 01:07:18,153
John, how you doin'?

556
01:07:18,263 --> 01:07:20,163
Never better.

557
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:23,267
All right.

558
01:07:33,878 --> 01:07:36,938
All right,
you're gonna hear a lot of ringing.

559
01:07:37,048 --> 01:07:39,448
I need you to stay very still.

560
01:07:39,551 --> 01:07:41,519
Here I go.

561
01:08:25,263 --> 01:08:28,562
All right, John,
I'm gonna remove the skull.

562
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:55,816
He's stabilized.

563
01:08:58,129 --> 01:08:59,357
John, I need you
to raise your hand

564
01:08:59,464 --> 01:09:00,829
and flex your fingers.

565
01:09:08,039 --> 01:09:09,631
John?

566
01:09:09,741 --> 01:09:11,538
John, raise your hand...
hand...

567
01:09:14,412 --> 01:09:15,879
John, can you hear me?

568
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:19,747
What's happening?

569
01:09:21,252 --> 01:09:23,243
John.

570
01:09:23,354 --> 01:09:24,685
What's happening to him?

571
01:09:24,789 --> 01:09:26,882
What's happening?

572
01:09:28,927 --> 01:09:30,224
What's wrong?

573
01:09:37,268 --> 01:09:38,565
What's wrong?

574
01:09:40,605 --> 01:09:43,335
Why isn't he moving?

575
01:09:43,441 --> 01:09:45,136
Do something!

576
01:09:45,243 --> 01:09:46,733
Please.

577
01:09:50,448 --> 01:09:51,574
Stay with me, John.

578
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:57,519
Good.

579
01:09:57,622 --> 01:09:59,351
- I love you.
- I love you.

580
01:09:59,457 --> 01:10:02,483
Breathe!
Breathe, damn it.

581
01:10:02,594 --> 01:10:04,186
Breathe, John.

582
01:10:04,295 --> 01:10:05,626
I love...

583
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:07,357
Breathe.

584
01:10:12,136 --> 01:10:14,696
I...

585
01:10:14,806 --> 01:10:17,104
I love you.

586
01:10:50,341 --> 01:10:52,309
You will give everything to me.

587
01:10:54,846 --> 01:10:56,313
Every cell in your body.

588
01:10:58,683 --> 01:10:59,707
Is that understood?

589
01:11:01,019 --> 01:11:02,008
Yes.

590
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:10,354
The marks on your arms...
they're from another life.

591
01:11:10,461 --> 01:11:13,021
We'll leave that life behind.

592
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,168
When you go down
that corridor...

593
01:11:23,374 --> 01:11:24,932
there is no turning back.

594
01:11:25,043 --> 01:11:26,874
Do you understand that?

595
01:11:28,546 --> 01:11:30,070
Yes.

596
01:11:31,382 --> 01:11:32,849
Then start with this.

597
01:11:44,729 --> 01:11:46,026
Go.

598
01:12:09,587 --> 01:12:11,817
Who is that?

599
01:12:11,923 --> 01:12:13,117
Who's in there?

600
01:12:14,425 --> 01:12:15,892
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

601
01:12:17,929 --> 01:12:19,897
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

602
01:13:33,104 --> 01:13:35,197
Put his left leg in the shackle.

603
01:15:00,658 --> 01:15:03,024
It's time to start our game.

604
01:15:31,589 --> 01:15:32,886
What's that?

605
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:35,515
Slow my heart rate.

606
01:15:35,626 --> 01:15:37,787
Relax my muscles.

607
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,858
It's time.

608
01:15:47,605 --> 01:15:49,937
Close the door behind you.

609
01:17:30,007 --> 01:17:31,907
He can't hear you.

610
01:17:32,009 --> 01:17:34,239
He doesn't even know you're there.

611
01:17:44,155 --> 01:17:45,645
Amanda.

612
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:48,358
Put... it... away.

613
01:17:48,459 --> 01:17:50,086
Trust me.

614
01:17:50,895 --> 01:17:52,726
Put it away.

615
01:17:56,834 --> 01:17:58,699
Leave us alone.

616
01:18:00,137 --> 01:18:02,162
Now.

617
01:18:02,273 --> 01:18:04,002
You fucking freak.

618
01:18:05,576 --> 01:18:08,170
I apologize for her behavior.

619
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:11,714
She swims in my sea.

620
01:18:13,217 --> 01:18:15,447
In the end,
she will be the closest

621
01:18:15,553 --> 01:18:18,454
I've ever come to a connection,

622
01:18:18,556 --> 01:18:20,023
to being understood.

623
01:18:22,893 --> 01:18:27,353
But her emotion
is also her... weakness.

624
01:19:14,778 --> 01:19:15,745
Adam.

625
01:19:17,781 --> 01:19:18,839
Adam.

626
01:19:27,525 --> 01:19:29,186
Come here.

627
01:19:29,293 --> 01:19:30,590
I'm gonna help you.

628
01:19:32,129 --> 01:19:33,426
I'm gonna help you.

629
01:19:38,302 --> 01:19:39,929
I'm gonna free you.

630
01:20:09,466 --> 01:20:10,660
Adam!

631
01:21:06,123 --> 01:21:08,853
I'm so sorry about your son, Jeff.

632
01:21:10,794 --> 01:21:13,456
But let me tell you something that I...

633
01:21:13,564 --> 01:21:14,792
that I know for sure.

634
01:21:14,898 --> 01:21:18,834
No sentence I gave him,
not 500 years,

635
01:21:18,936 --> 01:21:23,805
not even death, nothing,
will take your pain away.

636
01:21:23,907 --> 01:21:26,967
And vengeance doesn't
solve anything.

637
01:21:27,077 --> 01:21:30,205
It only makes
the pain greater, Jeff.

638
01:21:52,269 --> 01:21:54,134
What the...
What the fuck?

639
01:21:55,939 --> 01:21:57,270
Somebody, help me!

640
01:21:58,976 --> 01:22:00,671
What the fuck?

641
01:22:03,781 --> 01:22:05,078
Help.

642
01:22:10,621 --> 01:22:13,419
What the fu--
What the fuck are you doin'?

643
01:22:15,726 --> 01:22:16,693
Please help me.

644
01:22:19,129 --> 01:22:20,357
Hello, Jeff.

645
01:22:20,464 --> 01:22:22,091
If you are listening to this,

646
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:27,034
that means that the confrontation
you so long dreamed of

647
01:22:27,137 --> 01:22:28,695
is finally unfolding.

648
01:22:28,806 --> 01:22:30,535
Do something!

649
01:22:30,641 --> 01:22:33,371
In your head he is a cipher,

650
01:22:33,477 --> 01:22:35,638
a symbol of your life changing,

651
01:22:35,746 --> 01:22:37,043
a symbol of death.

652
01:22:37,147 --> 01:22:42,551
I present him to you now
as a simple human being.

653
01:22:42,653 --> 01:22:44,052
His name is Timothy Young.

654
01:22:44,154 --> 01:22:45,883
He's 27 years old,

655
01:22:45,989 --> 01:22:48,549
a medical student
with a mother and a father

656
01:22:48,659 --> 01:22:50,456
just like you,

657
01:22:50,561 --> 01:22:54,327
a man whose life also changed
the day your son died.

658
01:22:58,869 --> 01:23:01,235
That day he made
a terrible mistake.

659
01:23:06,977 --> 01:23:08,808
You believed he didn't pay
for that mistake,

660
01:23:08,912 --> 01:23:12,211
and now is your chance
to make him pay.

661
01:23:12,316 --> 01:23:17,151
The device Timothy is strapped to
is my personal favorite.

662
01:23:17,254 --> 01:23:18,551
I call it the rack.

663
01:23:24,294 --> 01:23:27,821
The human body
is a miraculous creation.

664
01:23:27,931 --> 01:23:31,662
Ever wonder how far
the arm can twist?

665
01:23:31,769 --> 01:23:34,670
This device is going
to start twisting.

666
01:23:34,772 --> 01:23:37,502
There is a chance he might live,
though, with your help.

667
01:23:37,608 --> 01:23:38,506
Please...

668
01:23:38,609 --> 01:23:41,339
To your right is a box.

669
01:23:41,445 --> 01:23:43,379
At the back of the box is a key.

670
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,176
It's tied to the trigger of a shotgun.

671
01:23:46,283 --> 01:23:48,683
The question you have to
ask yourself is this...

672
01:23:50,888 --> 01:23:51,855
Are you willing...

673
01:23:51,955 --> 01:23:53,354
Have mercy!

674
01:23:53,457 --> 01:23:56,949
...to take a bullet for the man
who killed your son?

675
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:59,688
Does "Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you"

676
01:23:59,797 --> 01:24:01,560
apply here, Jeff?

677
01:24:01,665 --> 01:24:03,155
Make your choice.

678
01:24:52,516 --> 01:24:53,949
My God.

679
01:25:03,327 --> 01:25:05,488
You've got to help him, Jeff!

680
01:25:12,736 --> 01:25:13,760
Fuck me!

681
01:25:13,871 --> 01:25:15,896
Please stop! Stop!

682
01:25:16,006 --> 01:25:18,338
Stop! Please stop!

683
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:34,787
Jeff!

684
01:25:38,929 --> 01:25:40,760
Jeff!

685
01:25:40,864 --> 01:25:44,197
Just standing there
you're an accomplice to murder!

686
01:25:44,301 --> 01:25:45,325
Are you a murderer?

687
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:48,702
I've wanted
to kill him every day.

688
01:25:48,805 --> 01:25:49,772
Oh, my God!

689
01:25:49,873 --> 01:25:53,536
For three years,
I wanted to kill you.

690
01:25:53,644 --> 01:25:55,111
Yeah, maybe I am.

691
01:25:55,212 --> 01:25:56,645
You'll lose your family.

692
01:25:56,747 --> 01:25:57,805
Oh, my God!

693
01:25:57,915 --> 01:25:59,143
Your wife, your daughter.

694
01:25:59,249 --> 01:26:01,240
I killed him.

695
01:26:03,086 --> 01:26:04,519
Fuck!

696
01:26:15,232 --> 01:26:16,199
Oh, God.

697
01:26:19,169 --> 01:26:21,034
Okay.

698
01:26:23,473 --> 01:26:24,804
Hold on, son.

699
01:26:47,664 --> 01:26:50,098
Hold on. Don't give up.

700
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,224
Come on, son.

701
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:55,365
Oh, God! Oh, God!

702
01:26:56,039 --> 01:26:57,301
Son.

703
01:27:08,852 --> 01:27:10,183
Got the key.

704
01:27:25,636 --> 01:27:27,729
Help me!

705
01:27:27,838 --> 01:27:28,896
Help me!

706
01:27:37,381 --> 01:27:38,348
Help me!

707
01:27:38,448 --> 01:27:39,437
Stop!

708
01:27:40,817 --> 01:27:42,284
I forgive him!

709
01:27:45,322 --> 01:27:48,086
I forgive him! No!

710
01:27:48,191 --> 01:27:51,319
No!

711
01:27:51,428 --> 01:27:52,452
God!

712
01:27:54,231 --> 01:27:56,825
God damn you!

713
01:28:30,167 --> 01:28:32,192
Don't you think it would be wise

714
01:28:32,302 --> 01:28:36,705
to engage me in conversation
for your own sake?

715
01:28:36,807 --> 01:28:38,297
I asked you to tell me
about your husband.

716
01:28:42,713 --> 01:28:44,977
It's like we're strangers now.

717
01:28:45,082 --> 01:28:47,414
And?

718
01:28:47,517 --> 01:28:52,113
The last time I saw him,
we were so disconnected.

719
01:28:52,222 --> 01:28:53,382
But now...

720
01:28:56,093 --> 01:29:00,154
I'd give anything in the world...

721
01:29:03,867 --> 01:29:06,233
...to see my husband.

722
01:29:06,336 --> 01:29:08,668
Matrimony's always
fascinated me.

723
01:29:08,772 --> 01:29:11,206
Husbands barely able
to look at their wives,

724
01:29:11,308 --> 01:29:12,673
wives on their backs

725
01:29:12,776 --> 01:29:16,109
in motel rooms
with perfect strangers,

726
01:29:16,213 --> 01:29:18,875
people who bear children
only to neglect them.

727
01:29:18,982 --> 01:29:21,610
Till death do us part, indeed.

728
01:29:21,718 --> 01:29:24,949
I don't know
what you think you know,

729
01:29:25,055 --> 01:29:27,785
but my marriage has
survived more suffering

730
01:29:27,891 --> 01:29:30,359
than someone like you
could ever grasp.

731
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:31,427
Suffering?

732
01:29:33,063 --> 01:29:34,690
You haven't seen anything yet.

733
01:29:37,834 --> 01:29:39,495
Someone like me?
Who am I?

734
01:29:39,603 --> 01:29:41,969
A monster.

735
01:29:42,072 --> 01:29:43,004
A murderer.

736
01:29:43,106 --> 01:29:44,630
I don't condone murder,

737
01:29:44,741 --> 01:29:48,336
and I... despise murderers.

738
01:29:48,445 --> 01:29:50,970
Please.

739
01:29:56,419 --> 01:29:59,081
Please... let me go.

740
01:30:06,029 --> 01:30:06,961
We're fine, Amanda.

741
01:30:07,063 --> 01:30:08,997
We don't need you.

742
01:30:13,403 --> 01:30:14,495
I said, we're fine.

743
01:30:27,751 --> 01:30:29,309
If you make it through this, Lynn,

744
01:30:29,419 --> 01:30:31,853
you're gonna thank me one day
just as Amanda did.

745
01:30:39,696 --> 01:30:42,426
Please, let me go.

746
01:30:42,532 --> 01:30:45,990
I saved your life.

747
01:30:46,102 --> 01:30:49,162
Maybe my life isn't the one
you were saving after all.

748
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:55,339
Tell me about your daughter.

749
01:30:55,445 --> 01:30:57,913
I understand she's quite
a little athlete.

750
01:31:04,487 --> 01:31:07,012
Or we could talk about your son.

751
01:31:07,123 --> 01:31:08,454
What did you say?

752
01:31:12,395 --> 01:31:13,862
Why are you living with the dead

753
01:31:13,964 --> 01:31:16,057
when you have such
a beautiful family,

754
01:31:16,166 --> 01:31:20,364
a husband who is indeed alone,

755
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:22,802
a daughter who needs her mother,

756
01:31:22,906 --> 01:31:26,364
patients who need
a competent physician

757
01:31:26,476 --> 01:31:28,341
who looks them in the eye

758
01:31:28,445 --> 01:31:30,675
and treats them
like human beings?

759
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,805
He's completed the third test.

760
01:31:32,916 --> 01:31:35,282
Congratulations, Lynn.

761
01:31:35,385 --> 01:31:36,477
You're free to go.

762
01:31:38,221 --> 01:31:40,382
Yeah, but he's not
all the way out yet.

763
01:31:42,025 --> 01:31:44,994
Undo her collar, Amanda,
and let her go.

764
01:31:45,095 --> 01:31:47,723
No, he's not finished.

765
01:31:47,831 --> 01:31:49,389
He's not all the way.

766
01:31:49,499 --> 01:31:53,401
Amanda, Lynn is more important
than you know.

767
01:31:53,503 --> 01:31:57,496
Unlock her collar and let her go.

768
01:31:57,607 --> 01:31:59,837
I said no.

769
01:32:04,014 --> 01:32:05,572
Amanda, there are rules.

770
01:32:05,682 --> 01:32:06,910
I said no!

771
01:32:09,019 --> 01:32:10,919
She doesn't deserve to go free.

772
01:32:11,021 --> 01:32:11,988
You promised.

773
01:32:12,088 --> 01:32:13,521
I didn't promise you shit.

774
01:32:13,623 --> 01:32:16,114
Amanda, even with that gun,

775
01:32:16,226 --> 01:32:21,289
it is Lynn who holds
your life in her hand.

776
01:32:21,398 --> 01:32:22,387
Fuck you.

777
01:32:22,499 --> 01:32:24,729
You give her control over me?

778
01:32:24,834 --> 01:32:26,199
Fuck you!

779
01:32:26,303 --> 01:32:28,396
I won't tell anyone.
I promise I won't.

780
01:32:28,505 --> 01:32:29,802
Please, I have a family.

781
01:32:29,906 --> 01:32:32,568
Shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up!

782
01:32:32,676 --> 01:32:34,701
And stop fuckin' moving around!

783
01:32:34,811 --> 01:32:38,247
And what about the other
test subjects that we left alive?

784
01:32:38,348 --> 01:32:39,178
Game over.

785
01:32:39,282 --> 01:32:41,011
I'll fucking kill you!

786
01:32:41,117 --> 01:32:42,516
What about them?

787
01:32:42,619 --> 01:32:44,849
Was that how you felt about them?

788
01:32:47,691 --> 01:32:50,125
Was that how you felt
about Eric Matthews?

789
01:32:50,226 --> 01:32:51,250
Eric Matthews.

790
01:32:51,361 --> 01:32:52,521
<i>Let me go.</i>

791
01:32:52,629 --> 01:32:56,326
I'll tell you how I felt
about Eric Matthews.

792
01:33:24,995 --> 01:33:26,758
Daniel!

793
01:33:31,334 --> 01:33:32,130
Fuck.

794
01:33:32,235 --> 01:33:34,100
Daniel!

795
01:33:46,249 --> 01:33:48,012
Daniel?

796
01:34:17,981 --> 01:34:19,175
Fuck!

797
01:35:26,749 --> 01:35:28,182
Where's my son?

798
01:35:30,587 --> 01:35:32,953
Where is he, you junkie bitch?

799
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,427
Where is he?

800
01:35:52,142 --> 01:35:54,042
Tell me where he is.

801
01:35:54,144 --> 01:35:55,805
Tell me where he is.

802
01:35:55,912 --> 01:35:57,573
Right fuckin' here.

803
01:36:16,332 --> 01:36:17,856
You bitch!

804
01:36:22,572 --> 01:36:24,597
You're nothin', bitch!

805
01:36:26,876 --> 01:36:29,003
You're nothing!

806
01:36:34,317 --> 01:36:36,012
You're not Jigsaw.

807
01:36:40,123 --> 01:36:42,614
You're not Jigsaw, bitch!

808
01:36:52,368 --> 01:36:54,233
You hear me?

809
01:36:55,138 --> 01:36:56,662
You're nothing!

810
01:36:59,242 --> 01:37:01,506
You're not Jigsaw, bitch.

811
01:37:04,914 --> 01:37:06,506
You're nothin'!

812
01:37:10,086 --> 01:37:12,850
I'll fuckin' kill you!

813
01:37:12,956 --> 01:37:13,923
No!

814
01:37:14,290 --> 01:37:15,723
That's right.

815
01:37:15,825 --> 01:37:18,123
I'm a murderer.

816
01:37:18,228 --> 01:37:20,753
He took my life from me,

817
01:37:20,863 --> 01:37:23,093
so I just returned
the fuckin' favor.

818
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:26,100
No, Amanda,
that's what you thought,

819
01:37:26,202 --> 01:37:28,670
but I know different.

820
01:37:28,771 --> 01:37:31,262
You left him for dead, didn't you?

821
01:37:31,374 --> 01:37:32,773
Stop fucking with me.

822
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:36,106
But I cleaned up
your mistakes.

823
01:37:36,212 --> 01:37:38,476
I forgave you for them.

824
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:42,347
Let me go! Please!

825
01:37:42,452 --> 01:37:45,444
What you do
is no different than murder.

826
01:37:45,555 --> 01:37:48,388
You torture people.
You watch them die.

827
01:37:48,491 --> 01:37:51,460
But now you're begging me
not to kill this worthless bitch

828
01:37:51,561 --> 01:37:53,290
on the grounds of some game?

829
01:37:53,396 --> 01:37:55,626
You are walking us
toward a precipice, Amanda.

830
01:37:55,732 --> 01:37:57,290
Step back.

831
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,697
It's bullshit.

832
01:37:58,801 --> 01:38:01,292
Nobody changes.

833
01:38:01,404 --> 01:38:02,371
It's all a lie.

834
01:38:02,472 --> 01:38:04,372
If you fail in this, we all fail.

835
01:38:04,474 --> 01:38:06,635
Succeed, and we all succeed.

836
01:38:06,743 --> 01:38:08,370
It's a lie!

837
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:16,685
I'll tell you,
she hasn't changed,

838
01:38:16,786 --> 01:38:19,084
because nobody fuckin' changes.

839
01:38:21,257 --> 01:38:22,485
Nobody is reborn.

840
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,718
It's all bullshit!

841
01:38:23,826 --> 01:38:25,817
It's all a fuckin' lie!

842
01:38:25,928 --> 01:38:28,726
And I'm just a pawn
in your stupid games.

843
01:38:41,778 --> 01:38:43,769
I don't mean anything to you.

844
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:46,508
No, you mean everything to me.

845
01:38:46,616 --> 01:38:48,345
Fuck you!

846
01:38:48,451 --> 01:38:50,214
Our fates are linked.

847
01:38:51,688 --> 01:38:53,781
I've tried to help you, Amanda.

848
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:55,755
So, help me!

849
01:38:55,858 --> 01:38:57,416
Fix me!

850
01:38:59,062 --> 01:39:00,654
Fix me, motherfucker!

851
01:39:02,398 --> 01:39:09,270
I'm standin' right here.

852
01:39:09,372 --> 01:39:10,669
Why is she so important to you?

853
01:39:12,175 --> 01:39:14,234
She's not important to me.

854
01:39:16,079 --> 01:39:17,603
She's important to you.

855
01:39:17,714 --> 01:39:19,944
She's not important to me.

856
01:39:20,049 --> 01:39:23,678
I beg you to reconsider that.

857
01:39:29,492 --> 01:39:31,357
This is your last chance, Amanda.

858
01:39:31,461 --> 01:39:32,723
She's nothing.

859
01:39:49,612 --> 01:39:51,580
Your time's running out.

860
01:39:55,218 --> 01:39:56,879
Now, you think about
what you're doing.

861
01:40:00,857 --> 01:40:03,155
Think about everything
that you've done.

862
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:13,498
You think about
what you promised me.

863
01:40:13,603 --> 01:40:16,265
Think about our dreams.

864
01:40:16,372 --> 01:40:17,999
Think about tomorrow.

865
01:40:21,010 --> 01:40:22,477
Lynn?

866
01:40:22,578 --> 01:40:24,205
Jeff! Jeff--

867
01:40:25,348 --> 01:40:26,406
Lynn.

868
01:40:29,051 --> 01:40:31,019
Lynn.

869
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:32,246
- Lynn.
- Jeff.

870
01:40:33,156 --> 01:40:34,817
You just destroyed four lives.

871
01:40:36,092 --> 01:40:37,787
You just murdered Jeff's wife.

872
01:40:57,780 --> 01:40:59,441
Baby.

873
01:40:59,549 --> 01:41:00,914
Amanda.

874
01:41:03,653 --> 01:41:04,620
It's okay.

875
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:11,920
This was your test...

876
01:41:13,463 --> 01:41:15,055
...your game.

877
01:41:17,266 --> 01:41:18,631
What do I want?

878
01:41:18,734 --> 01:41:20,395
I want to play a game.

879
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:24,165
You're being tested.

880
01:41:24,273 --> 01:41:25,399
Your will is being tested--

881
01:41:25,508 --> 01:41:27,408
Your will to keep someone alive.

882
01:41:27,510 --> 01:41:28,477
Can you do that?

883
01:41:28,578 --> 01:41:32,378
Can you follow the rules
and grant someone the gift of life?

884
01:41:34,784 --> 01:41:36,445
I was testing you.

885
01:41:36,552 --> 01:41:38,417
I took you in.

886
01:41:38,521 --> 01:41:40,512
You will give everything to me.

887
01:41:40,623 --> 01:41:41,612
Yes.

888
01:41:41,724 --> 01:41:42,782
Every cell in your body.

889
01:41:42,892 --> 01:41:47,886
I selected you for the honor
of carrying on my life's work.

890
01:41:47,997 --> 01:41:49,862
But you didn't.

891
01:41:49,966 --> 01:41:50,933
That's right.

892
01:41:52,902 --> 01:41:53,891
I'm a murderer.

893
01:41:54,003 --> 01:41:55,197
I despise murderers.

894
01:41:55,304 --> 01:41:57,534
You didn't test anyone's will to live.

895
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,005
Game over.

896
01:42:00,309 --> 01:42:02,869
Instead you took away
their only chance.

897
01:42:02,979 --> 01:42:05,607
Your games were unwinnable.

898
01:42:05,715 --> 01:42:07,444
Your subjects merely victims.

899
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:09,108
You.

900
01:42:10,052 --> 01:42:11,178
There is no turning back.

901
01:42:11,287 --> 01:42:13,278
Do you understand that?

902
01:42:13,389 --> 01:42:18,827
In my desperation,
I decided to give you one last chance.

903
01:42:18,928 --> 01:42:21,726
So I put everything in place.

904
01:42:23,099 --> 01:42:24,828
You chose her 'cause
she's the best, right?

905
01:42:24,934 --> 01:42:26,731
That's one reason I chose her.

906
01:42:26,836 --> 01:42:30,897
You didn't know that Lynn and Jeff
were husband and wife.

907
01:42:31,007 --> 01:42:36,206
I had to keep that from you
for the purposes of my game.

908
01:42:36,312 --> 01:42:38,507
I had to leave out
the ruined marriage,

909
01:42:38,614 --> 01:42:41,777
the cheating wife,

910
01:42:41,884 --> 01:42:46,617
the vengeful husband,
the neglected daughter.

911
01:42:46,722 --> 01:42:51,625
And I let you make
your own choices.

912
01:42:51,727 --> 01:42:54,924
I wanted you to succeed.

913
01:42:55,031 --> 01:42:58,057
Amanda, put it away.

914
01:42:58,167 --> 01:43:00,397
Trust me, even with that gun,

915
01:43:00,503 --> 01:43:04,166
it's Lynn who holds
your life in her hands.

916
01:43:04,273 --> 01:43:05,831
She's not important to me.

917
01:43:05,942 --> 01:43:08,467
I beg you to reconsider that.

918
01:43:08,578 --> 01:43:10,409
Unlock her collar
and let her go.

919
01:43:10,513 --> 01:43:12,845
I said no!

920
01:43:12,949 --> 01:43:15,076
The rules of our game
have been made very clear.

921
01:43:15,184 --> 01:43:17,482
You need to abide by those rules.

922
01:43:19,555 --> 01:43:20,522
You couldn't.

923
01:43:26,862 --> 01:43:28,557
God.

924
01:43:44,547 --> 01:43:45,673
Game over.

925
01:43:58,227 --> 01:44:00,286
You haven't learned anything tonight,
have you?

926
01:44:00,396 --> 01:44:04,594
Your rage and your vengeance
will only hurt the ones you love.

927
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:07,965
Killing me will only add
to your misery.

928
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:10,732
It will not bring back your son.

929
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:12,808
Think of your daughter, Jeff.

930
01:44:12,908 --> 01:44:16,901
She needs you now
more than ever.

931
01:44:17,013 --> 01:44:19,004
You can't kill me, Jeff.

932
01:44:28,658 --> 01:44:30,717
Your wife's dying, Jeff.

933
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Her time's running out.

934
01:44:42,271 --> 01:44:46,002
Jeff, do not miscalculate.

935
01:44:46,108 --> 01:44:47,769
Your fate is in my hands.

936
01:44:47,877 --> 01:44:50,675
Your wife's fate is in my hands.

937
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:53,010
I love you.

938
01:44:53,115 --> 01:44:54,742
I love you.

939
01:44:58,621 --> 01:45:01,181
I'm taking you home. Okay?

940
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:04,851
Though you may not
see any threat...

941
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,224
there are threats all around you.

942
01:45:07,329 --> 01:45:10,196
Jeff, if you try to move your wife,
she will die.

943
01:45:10,299 --> 01:45:13,063
I can have an ambulance here
in four minutes.

944
01:45:13,169 --> 01:45:15,865
Would you like to take your wife
out of here tonight?

945
01:45:15,971 --> 01:45:17,461
Would you like
to take her to safety?

946
01:45:17,573 --> 01:45:18,699
Stay.

947
01:45:18,808 --> 01:45:20,332
Stand and face me, Jeff.

948
01:45:20,443 --> 01:45:23,640
- Stay with me, please.
- Right now.

949
01:45:23,746 --> 01:45:27,079
Would you like to get your life back?

950
01:45:27,183 --> 01:45:28,081
Would you, Jeff?

951
01:45:28,184 --> 01:45:29,776
I can make that happen.

952
01:45:32,288 --> 01:45:34,279
Which is it, Jeff?

953
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:36,585
Come on... yes or no?

954
01:45:36,692 --> 01:45:37,681
Yes.

955
01:45:40,896 --> 01:45:42,158
What do you want?

956
01:45:42,264 --> 01:45:43,856
One final test.

957
01:45:43,966 --> 01:45:45,797
The rules are simple.

958
01:45:45,901 --> 01:45:50,133
Over on that table,
there's a host of vicious implements...

959
01:45:51,474 --> 01:45:55,035
which you can use
to exact your pound of flesh,

960
01:45:55,144 --> 01:45:56,475
to take your vengeance,

961
01:45:56,579 --> 01:45:59,810
to indulge your obsession.

962
01:45:59,915 --> 01:46:05,080
Or you can choose to put
your vengeance aside,

963
01:46:05,187 --> 01:46:07,212
and you can forgive.

964
01:46:08,924 --> 01:46:12,325
You can forgive me for the pain

965
01:46:12,428 --> 01:46:15,124
that I've caused you
and your wife tonight.

966
01:46:16,599 --> 01:46:17,657
Jeff.

967
01:46:17,767 --> 01:46:19,394
Which is it gonna be, Jeff?

968
01:46:23,839 --> 01:46:25,830
Honey, don't do it.

969
01:46:25,941 --> 01:46:28,068
Jeff...

970
01:46:29,945 --> 01:46:31,503
It's up to you.

971
01:46:31,614 --> 01:46:32,672
I need you.

972
01:46:32,782 --> 01:46:35,842
Live or die, Jeff?

973
01:46:35,951 --> 01:46:37,748
Make our choice.

974
01:46:55,337 --> 01:46:56,429
I forgive you.

975
01:47:03,345 --> 01:47:05,711
Jeff...

976
01:47:05,815 --> 01:47:08,409
Jeff. Jeff!

977
01:47:17,426 --> 01:47:18,518
Jeff, no.

978
01:47:32,808 --> 01:47:34,901
I forgive you.

979
01:47:47,256 --> 01:47:49,019
Hello, Jeff.

980
01:47:49,124 --> 01:47:53,584
I made this tape
as an insurance policy, if you will.

981
01:47:53,696 --> 01:47:54,754
Jeff!

982
01:47:56,732 --> 01:48:00,168
And if you're listening to it,
then it's time to collect.

983
01:48:02,738 --> 01:48:05,832
I was your final test of forgiveness.

984
01:48:05,941 --> 01:48:07,636
And if you are listening to this,

985
01:48:07,743 --> 01:48:09,677
then you failed.

986
01:48:11,013 --> 01:48:14,278
Now you must pay the price...

987
01:48:14,383 --> 01:48:16,943
the price for living
for nothing but vengeance.

988
01:48:17,052 --> 01:48:21,216
Now I will give you
something to live for.

989
01:48:21,323 --> 01:48:24,053
I told you that
you couldn't kill me, Jeff,

990
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:26,525
but I didn't tell you why,

991
01:48:26,629 --> 01:48:27,789
and the answer is simple.

992
01:48:27,897 --> 01:48:32,732
I am the person responsible
for the loss of your child.

993
01:48:32,835 --> 01:48:38,432
I am the only person who knows
where your daughter is.

994
01:48:39,341 --> 01:48:42,310
She only has a limited supply of air, Jeff,

995
01:48:42,411 --> 01:48:43,673
and if you want to get her back,

996
01:48:43,779 --> 01:48:45,804
you'll have to play a game.

997
01:48:51,854 --> 01:48:52,752
Jeff!
