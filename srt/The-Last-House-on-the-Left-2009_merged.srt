1
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:52,720
So the next week, he's even hornier,

2
00:01:52,804 --> 00:01:55,139
but this time he's got
20 bucks instead of 10.

3
00:01:55,223 --> 00:01:56,348
He goes back to
the whorehouse,

4
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:59,185
he slaps down a 20, tells
the madam he needs to get off

5
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:01,604
but he ain't gonna screw
no damn chicken this time.

6
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,440
She says it still ain't
much, but she can help.

7
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,193
She tells him to go to the
room at the top of the stairs.

8
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:09,987
This time, it's just a
bunch of guys jerking off.

9
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:13,490
But one of the jerk-off guys assures
him. You know, "It's cool, it's cool,"

10
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:16,410
and he waves him over
to this hole in the floor

11
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:17,620
that they're all
looking through.

12
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:21,040
Can we stop, please? I
really gotta take a piss.

13
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,834
Fuck you.

14
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,378
So anyway, there's these two hot
lesbians and they're going at it.

15
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,199
What, are you praying now?

16
00:02:56,493 --> 00:03:01,914
Oh, Lord, won't you grant me an
empty mayonnaise jar to piss in?

17
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:05,793
You know, Krug,

18
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
considering the rather notorious
nature of the prison you're headed to,
I think I'd pray for something
a little bit more substantial.

19
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,972
Fuck!

20
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:04,268
Come on.

21
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:06,145
Here.

22
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,530
You okay? Yeah.

23
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:24,913
Did I do good?

24
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:26,749
Tell me I did good!

25
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,376
Hit us a little harder next
time, Francis. Where's my kid?

26
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:30,919
He's fine.

27
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:44,308
What? I can't understand you!

28
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:48,771
I think he's saying,
"Take my money."

29
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,773
Take the money, huh?

30
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:55,444
I think he's dying now.

31
00:04:56,988 --> 00:04:58,697
What do you think he's seeing?

32
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:06,372
Something he'll
never see again.

33
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,807
Hi.

34
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:09,101
What's my time?

35
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:11,728
It's perfect, awesome.

36
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:13,814
Come on. Hand it over.

37
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:16,567
Come on. Let me see it.

38
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:18,193
It's great.

39
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:20,404
Mom, let me see.

40
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:24,533
Sweetheart, your time is perfect,
okay. It's time for vacation.

41
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:26,452
Tell the or that
the compound fracture

42
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:27,828
to the left femur
is on its way up.

43
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:30,956
We're transfusing two units of O-Neg.
I want them to have plenty more on hand.

44
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,999
Yes, Doctor. So, Mr. Hadley,

45
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,625
can you just follow my finger?

46
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,336
Just like that. Excellent.
You're gonna be fine, okay?

47
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:39,006
We'll get you back on your
bike in no time. Let's go, guys.

48
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,549
I love that shirt, by the way.

49
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:44,136
The color alone must've taken
a few minutes of your time.

50
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:46,096
Hi. Hey.

51
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:47,890
Hey, Mary-Anne. Yeah?

52
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,267
Where's that head CT. I
ordered? It's been half an hour.

53
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,104
He got a B-minus for the
semester, which is fantastic,

54
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:56,899
and I will be happy to write
him a letter of recommendation.

55
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:01,153
Yeah, if you need to get in touch
with me this summer, you have my cell.

56
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:04,406
Okay, have a great
summer. All right. Bye-bye.

57
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:08,660
That woman drives me nuts.

58
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:12,789
Okay, so are you on vacation
now or should I just make a U-ey?

59
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,052
Dad?

60
00:07:27,722 --> 00:07:29,264
Dad? Honey!

61
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:34,144
Yo, yo. What's up, what's up?

62
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:39,525
Are we there yet?

63
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,777
We are making the turn now.

64
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:50,077
Geez, you think somebody
would change that sign.

65
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:53,455
I kind of like it. It tells
me the turn's coming up.

66
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:30,158
My hydrangea came back.

67
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:42,296
Place looks good.

68
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,218
Yeah. I'm sure inside is
a different story, but...

69
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,472
Why? Yeah, why?

70
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:56,893
I didn't tell you? Dan
was up fishing last week.

71
00:08:57,478 --> 00:09:00,939
No, Em, you didn't. You
let your brother stay here?

72
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:02,983
Yeah. U nsupervised?

73
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:06,570
Honey, don't worry. I made him promise
to sleep in the guest house. It's fine.

74
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:10,782
So he and whoever he was with
trashed not one house but two, right?

75
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:14,036
Would you mind if I
stayed in the guest house?

76
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:17,289
I promise I won't trash it.

77
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,325
"Hey, kids, have
a drink on me.

78
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:56,912
"Thanks for letting me fish
the lake out. Love, Dan. "

79
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,914
This is $4 champagne.

80
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,417
So? Be nice.

81
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,449
Oh, shit.

82
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,991
Jesus. Hi.

83
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:22,534
Hi. What the...

84
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:24,369
Microwave is broken?

85
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:25,745
I don't know how he did it.

86
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,541
Oh, no. Honey, my brother
did not break the microwave.

87
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,877
You have no evidence of that.

88
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:34,754
Hey, do you guys
need the car today?

89
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:40,802
'Cause I was thinking maybe
I could meet up with Paige.

90
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,138
She said she'd
be working today.

91
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,726
Okay. But we just got here. I was
gonna cook supper and hangout and...

92
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,813
Well, maybe you guys could have
a nice dinner alone tonight?

93
00:13:54,317 --> 00:13:55,775
Here you go.

94
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:01,615
Mom, are you sure?

95
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:06,536
No, I'm not sure, but Dad
seems awfully sure about it.

96
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:08,705
I know that you haven't
seen Paige in a while. So...

97
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,540
Here. Have fun.

98
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,585
Whoa. Thanks, Dad.

99
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:15,962
All right.

100
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:20,425
Just promise, promise that you will
call me. Okay? That's all I'm asking.

101
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:22,802
Okay, I will. All right?

102
00:14:23,304 --> 00:14:25,722
Love you. I love you.

103
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:26,932
Bye, babe.

104
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:29,976
Bye, Dad. I'll see
you guys later. Okay.

105
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,688
Please be careful.

106
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,541
I don't know if you're
gonna be able to keep up

107
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,378
with the fast pace of the town, but
we just got a new yogurt stand, so...

108
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,546
Whoa, you think you can
get us a table? Yeah.

109
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,007
You know, I got connections. I
could probably pull some strings.

110
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:03,218
How much do I
owe you for this?

111
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,053
That is $5.25.

112
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:07,514
Thank you. Have a good day.

113
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,310
Listen, Mari, I...

114
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:15,021
I couldn't believe it
when I heard about Ben.

115
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:16,231
I know.

116
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,607
I know I should
have called you.

117
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:21,987
I just figured... Paige,
you're fine. It's...

118
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,322
Well...

119
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:26,700
Okay, new subject. Yeah, yeah.

120
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:28,827
So, what do you feel
like doing tonight?

121
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:32,163
Do you... Do you
still smoke pot?

122
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:35,000
No, I don't really
do that stuff anymore.

123
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:38,044
Yeah, you're like a
big athlete now, or...

124
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,338
Hey.

125
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,676
Yeah, do you need a
basket for all that?

126
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:50,098
I don't think we've
met. What's your name?

127
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,184
It's Justin.

128
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:56,187
Justin, I'm Paige.
And this is Mari.

129
00:15:56,272 --> 00:15:58,690
Mari, this is Justin.
Justin, this is Mari.

130
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:00,525
Hi. Hey.

131
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:01,943
Is that all for you?

132
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,528
Can I get a pack
of cigarettes?

133
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:05,363
Can I get some ID?

134
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:08,450
Can you just give me a pass?

135
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,619
Justin, I would if I
ruled the world, but...

136
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:16,082
What if you help
me and I help you?

137
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,752
And how are you gonna help me?

138
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:24,215
Look, you know, I've got some premium
grade-A shit back at the motel.

139
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,467
Really?

140
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:28,803
Yeah, I mean, you can
see it for yourself.

141
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,477
I mean, I overheard you guys
talking a second ago, so...

142
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:45,779
That's $ 13.20, right?

143
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:03,046
Okay, from $20.
Here you go. Thanks.

144
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,423
Your turn.

145
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:10,303
Here we are. Very
fancy, Justin.

146
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:12,222
Left or right? Left.

147
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:16,142
So, Mari, I'll just run in and grab
it, and then we can go back to my place.

148
00:17:16,227 --> 00:17:17,602
My dad's not gonna
be home all night.

149
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:19,562
Okay, five minutes.

150
00:17:23,484 --> 00:17:25,860
All right, I'll
be two minutes.

151
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:52,011
Now it's weather and traffic,
and there's going to be

152
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:55,807
big clusters of storms developing,
going into nighttime hours as well...

153
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

154
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:27,922
Sorry, so sorry,
ma'am. It's...

155
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:33,219
This belong you?

156
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:34,888
No. No, sorry.

157
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:01,456
What the hell, you guys?

158
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,168
Mari, Justin was not kidding.
This is really good shit.

159
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:06,211
Clearly.

160
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,588
So how long were you
gonna let me sit out there?

161
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:10,882
Here. Have some.

162
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:12,759
Paige, we just had
this conversation.

163
00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:16,387
Come on. She's a
little out of practice.

164
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:18,056
Take it.

165
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:23,978
I'm just sitting on the bed. One
joint won't hurt you. Take it.

166
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,204
Hold on.

167
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,376
Hello, Mom?

168
00:19:46,961 --> 00:19:49,712
Hey, Mari, you were supposed
to call me an hour ago.

169
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:52,006
I know. I'm sorry.

170
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:54,676
There's a storm coming in.
What time are you coming home?

171
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,097
I was thinking maybe I could
just spend the night with Paige.

172
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:01,182
No, no, no. That
is not a good idea.

173
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,684
Listen to me. You're
17 years old...

174
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,481
Hello? Mom? You're breaking
up. I can't hear you.

175
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:11,025
Hello? Honey?
Hello? Are you there?

176
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,029
Mom, if you can hear me, I'll be
back first thing in the morning, okay?

177
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:17,198
I love you. Oh, my...

178
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,413
Who was that? That
was your daughter.

179
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:25,540
Now she's spending
the night with Paige.

180
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,709
This is ridiculous. I
knew this was gonna happen.

181
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,294
I should have
never let her leave.

182
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:31,796
There isn't much
we can do about it.

183
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,381
She does have the car.

184
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:11,085
So, Justin, my new found friend,
are you from a really big city?

185
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:15,006
No, you know, I'm
kind of from all over.

186
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,090
All over.

187
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:19,260
My dad and uncle have us
moving around a lot, so...

188
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:21,429
What do they do?

189
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:26,476
All sorts of things. You know,
I'm kind of out of the loop.

190
00:21:27,102 --> 00:21:29,812
Well, where's your mom?

191
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:35,026
She's dead.

192
00:21:36,737 --> 00:21:38,112
I'm sorry.

193
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:40,490
That's all right.

194
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:45,453
When did she die?

195
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:50,958
It was a while ago, so...

196
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:54,045
That's probably
enough death talk.

197
00:21:54,505 --> 00:21:56,964
Do you wanna move on
to a happier subject?

198
00:21:57,966 --> 00:21:59,300
Sure.

199
00:22:02,805 --> 00:22:04,514
Someone died?

200
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,393
My brother. About a year ago.

201
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:09,936
A year ago?

202
00:22:12,523 --> 00:22:15,525
What was his name? Ben.

203
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,200
Sorry.

204
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:28,913
You know what, Mari?

205
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:31,040
I think Justin here
could be kind of cute

206
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:35,420
if he lost his whole, like, creepy, hooded,
U nabomber kind of vibe he's got going on.

207
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:38,548
Don't you think? Yeah.

208
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,801
Look at this face he's got.

209
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:46,764
Here. Here, put this on.

210
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:48,433
No, actually that's... You
know, that's my uncle's.

211
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:50,560
Well, he's not here.
Just put it on. Come on.

212
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:53,563
Model it. Go on. Put it on.

213
00:22:59,153 --> 00:23:00,111
Not bad. Yeah,

214
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:02,780
but the hair doesn't
match the shirt anymore.

215
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:04,740
What could we do?

216
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,535
Come on, sit down.

217
00:23:09,163 --> 00:23:10,955
All right. I need some water.

218
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,791
You're gonna
love it. Trust us.

219
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:17,003
Okay. Do you think the
collar should go up or down?

220
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:18,629
Put it up.

221
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:20,465
Collar up. No, collar
up. I think collar down.

222
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:22,049
Fabio.

223
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:25,344
I love it. It's a big
improvement, Justin.

224
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:27,054
You're gonna get
all the ladies.

225
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,389
Oh, yeah.

226
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:36,981
Evening.

227
00:23:39,526 --> 00:23:40,735
Dad.

228
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:46,324
I... I thought you guys
weren't coming back...

229
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:49,494
Well, our timeline's
gotten sped up, so...

230
00:23:52,122 --> 00:23:54,081
Why? What's going on?

231
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,460
For Christ's sake, nephew,
are you gonna introduce us?

232
00:23:57,544 --> 00:24:02,465
Yeah, Frank. This is
Mari. That's Paige.

233
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:04,842
That's my U ncle Frank, Sadie.

234
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:07,637
That's my dad.

235
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,724
These are two
lovely girls, Justin.

236
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:15,394
Smells like you three have
been having some fun in here.

237
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:19,106
Yeah, it's like a regular
party. Who else you invite?

238
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,652
Nobody. It's just us.

239
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,363
Dad, look, I was just
trying to liquidate some...

240
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:29,659
Liquidate? Is that
my word or yours?

241
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,954
Mine. But... Am
I wrong? Is that...

242
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,373
No, Justin, you're not wrong.

243
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,710
Is that my shirt?

244
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,340
Yeah, Frank, I'm sorry...
No, no. Hey, hey, hey.

245
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:47,927
Keep it on. Looks good on you.

246
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:53,975
You know, we were
just... Playing dress up?

247
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,812
Well, I mean, we just sort of
gave him a bit of a makeover.

248
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:00,356
A makeover, really? No.

249
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,482
Yeah.

250
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:04,777
Well, I think that's the
greatest thing I've ever heard.

251
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:10,533
Wow. We'll just get
out of your way, Justin.

252
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:14,453
How much do we owe you? I
love your sweatshirt, Mari.

253
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:17,498
That your sport
utility out there, Mari?

254
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah. Nice.

255
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:22,086
Yeah, we could use a vehicle
like that right about now.

256
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,589
Yeah, 'cause ours is
pretty well fucked.

257
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:26,173
Like we are.

258
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:31,012
Thanks to you,
pumpkin. Fuck you!

259
00:25:31,847 --> 00:25:33,097
Later maybe.

260
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:35,057
Dad, what is going on...

261
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,521
We made the front page.
That's what's going on!

262
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,481
We figured they'd have my
face on there sooner or later,

263
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:45,109
but now they got
Sadie's to boot.

264
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:48,279
Can you believe
it, Paige, Mari?

265
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:52,783
Listen, mister... Sir...

266
00:25:54,494 --> 00:25:56,996
This is none of our
business. We won't...

267
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,914
You won't what?

268
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,959
This is none of our business.

269
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:03,753
It's a private matter.

270
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,467
Right. Right, and we won't
say anything to anybody.

271
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:13,554
Well, I don't know.
Frank, you believe them?

272
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,976
Yeah. You know, I
think maybe I could.

273
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:21,562
Yeah, well, I don't.

274
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:25,399
Well, you should. 'Cause we really
don't... We really don't give a shit.

275
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:28,402
Hey, Paige, calm down.

276
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:33,157
I swear... I mean, we swear that
we won't... We won't tell any...

277
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:35,076
Paige. Oh, my God!

278
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:39,455
We have thin walls, okay.
Oh, my... Please don't.

279
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:47,880
Please just... Please, just put the
knife down. You can have my keys.

280
00:26:47,964 --> 00:26:51,509
I don't care. Just don't
hurt her. Thanks, Mari.

281
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:53,094
Just don't...

282
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,223
Please...

283
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,186
Okay, sir, can we
please just go now?

284
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,105
Paige... Please...

285
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,315
Do you not like us, Paige?

286
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:10,528
I'm sorry, ladies.
We just can't risk it.

287
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:15,032
What? No! No, but...

288
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:18,202
Why can't you just...
Please, just let us go!

289
00:27:18,286 --> 00:27:20,246
Paige, just stay calm.

290
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,373
God damn it!

291
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:26,627
Somebody... Oh, God.

292
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:29,296
Please... Fuck!

293
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:31,882
Somebody, please! No!

294
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:33,175
Don't fucking move.

295
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:37,763
Somebody help!

296
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:40,808
Somebody! Help me!

297
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:42,476
Please!

298
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,812
Somebody help me!

299
00:27:45,105 --> 00:27:46,397
Help! Somebody!

300
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:55,322
Hey! What...

301
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:02,913
Anything? No. No,
we're still okay.

302
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:07,460
Francis! What the fuck!

303
00:28:07,544 --> 00:28:10,671
She's taking a nap.
But she'll come around.

304
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:13,966
I hate cell phones.

305
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:18,304
Everywhere you turn, nothing but
texting and yakking and texting.

306
00:28:25,145 --> 00:28:26,562
I hate them.

307
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,649
Load up.

308
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:40,701
Justin.

309
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,246
I'm sorry. They weren't
supposed to be back.

310
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:48,751
What?

311
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:52,505
That's your excuse?

312
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,840
Yes, sir.

313
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,724
Justin.

314
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:09,814
You gotta start putting other
people's needs ahead of your own.

315
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:12,983
You knew not to bring anybody
back here, but you did it anyway.

316
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:14,485
Didn't you?
Because I thought...

317
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:17,488
Because we weren't
supposed to be here.

318
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:23,452
Well, you did it.
It can't be undone.

319
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:28,290
Now you're gonna take
responsibility for that action.

320
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:32,086
It's as simple as that.
You know how we do that?

321
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:34,505
Look at her.

322
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:39,802
Just look at her. God.
Would you just let them...

323
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:42,930
Look at her!

324
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:50,479
That's a good start.

325
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,059
Put your seatbelt on.

326
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:26,075
Hell.

327
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,038
We're okay.

328
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:32,957
You're okay.

329
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,422
Now I go left, right?

330
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:28,095
Looks like that road that's
over the mountain is left.

331
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,764
Right takes you
back to the lake.

332
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,182
Go left.

333
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,022
I've been coming here for years.
You're looking for Highway 43,

334
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:41,400
the two-lane that goes
over the mountains. Right?

335
00:32:41,943 --> 00:32:44,194
I guess that's the one, Mari.

336
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,321
Then you need to go left.

337
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,960
Thanks for the clarity, Mari.

338
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,471
Thanks for being so
cooperative, Mari.

339
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,307
What good would
it do me not to be?

340
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:18,312
I always took your kind to be
whiny little fucking bitches

341
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,857
born with silver spoons
up their asses, but you,

342
00:33:21,941 --> 00:33:25,360
I think maybe there's
hope for you, Mari.

343
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:31,575
I don't know, Krug. I think Mari here
has some potential you should consider.

344
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:33,077
Krug, what do you think?

345
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:36,830
I think she's been a cool
customer ever since the motel.

346
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,666
He agrees.

347
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,935
Oh, my God!

348
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:11,740
Come on!

349
00:34:11,825 --> 00:34:13,492
You get the fuck...

350
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,915
Handle it!

351
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,252
Dad, watch out!

352
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:31,653
Shit.

353
00:35:42,123 --> 00:35:43,707
Motherfucker.

354
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:52,466
You bitch.

355
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:03,352
Sadie, you okay?

356
00:36:03,436 --> 00:36:06,271
Do I look
O-fucking-kay? Fuck!

357
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:11,985
Oh, no. No, no, no.

358
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,447
This is gonna scar.
It's gonna scar forever!

359
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:20,994
Well, then you should let her
know how you feel about that.

360
00:36:23,373 --> 00:36:24,706
Yeah!

361
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,293
Fuck!

362
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:35,801
You bitch!

363
00:36:37,553 --> 00:36:38,804
Fuck you!

364
00:36:38,888 --> 00:36:41,682
Fucking bitch, you
burned my fucking face!

365
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,684
Why the fuck did you do that?

366
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,644
Oh, my God! Mari!

367
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:46,937
Damn it! Fuck!

368
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:49,231
Mari! Paige, run!

369
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:51,942
Come here!

370
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:53,777
Bring her back!

371
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:13,505
Help!

372
00:37:15,675 --> 00:37:17,009
Somebody!

373
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,680
Help me! Help!

374
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:29,688
Get back here,
you stupid cunt!

375
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:31,857
Come on back, Paige!

376
00:37:34,444 --> 00:37:35,485
No!

377
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,820
Stop!

378
00:37:38,197 --> 00:37:39,906
Please.

379
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:01,386
Hey, Paige!

380
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:08,518
Paige!

381
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:11,438
Fuck!

382
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,348
Help! Somebody!

383
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:50,352
Help me! Somebody
help me! Help me!

384
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,443
Please help me! No!

385
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:16,920
No.

386
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,713
No?

387
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:23,844
Krug says he wants
us to bring her back.

388
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,064
Get up!

389
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:18,398
Now what?

390
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:40,420
You ready to be a man?

391
00:40:42,924 --> 00:40:44,090
What?

392
00:40:50,473 --> 00:40:52,766
Pick one. Or both.

393
00:40:56,312 --> 00:40:58,146
What are you doing?

394
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,526
No, no, no.

395
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,693
No!

396
00:41:03,778 --> 00:41:05,654
Come on. Grab her.

397
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:09,115
Hold on!

398
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,703
I'm teaching you a lesson,
son! Just... Come on.

399
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:17,582
Jesus, just like
that. Look at that.

400
00:41:21,295 --> 00:41:22,504
Come here.

401
00:41:24,257 --> 00:41:27,634
Yeah. See? Let's get
him all worked up.

402
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,512
Get him all worked
up and tingling.

403
00:41:32,306 --> 00:41:33,557
There.

404
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,648
What's the matter with you!

405
00:41:45,152 --> 00:41:47,737
Never gonna get
easier than this!

406
00:41:47,822 --> 00:41:49,573
You're pathetic!

407
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:53,868
What'd you say, Paige?

408
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,289
Where did that come
from all of a sudden?

409
00:42:01,877 --> 00:42:03,712
My goodness. Come here.

410
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:08,258
Are you gonna hit me now?

411
00:42:08,342 --> 00:42:10,760
No, honey, not hit.

412
00:42:13,556 --> 00:42:14,806
No!

413
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:23,857
No! No! No!

414
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,420
Paige!

415
00:42:56,682 --> 00:43:00,477
You think I'm pathetic, Paige?
Look at my fucking kid here!

416
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:08,735
Well, Mari, looks like
she's in a lot of pain.

417
00:43:11,906 --> 00:43:14,324
Get that hair
out of her mouth.

418
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:19,746
Tell her everything's gonna be
okay. Tell her help's on the way.

419
00:43:20,414 --> 00:43:23,083
Tell her it's not
as bad as it looks.

420
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,213
Do it. She needs you!

421
00:43:28,297 --> 00:43:29,714
I won't!

422
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,595
God damn it! Leave me alone!

423
00:43:38,808 --> 00:43:39,933
No.

424
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,645
Don't! Don't do this!

425
00:43:43,729 --> 00:43:47,190
You think you can fuck
with me whenever you want?

426
00:43:47,274 --> 00:43:49,484
She doesn't think so, see.

427
00:43:49,568 --> 00:43:50,610
Come on.

428
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:55,907
She's a liar.

429
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:09,462
Look around.
Look what she did.

430
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:14,884
No! No! No! No!

431
00:44:15,803 --> 00:44:17,721
No! You hear that?

432
00:44:27,189 --> 00:44:28,523
No!

433
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:41,995
No, please! Please...

434
00:44:48,627 --> 00:44:50,170
Jesus Christ!

435
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:56,593
Justin, please.

436
00:44:57,803 --> 00:45:00,305
No. You stay right
there, Justin.

437
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:04,601
Please!

438
00:45:05,144 --> 00:45:07,687
Please, please, please...

439
00:45:29,168 --> 00:45:31,878
What is that? You want that?

440
00:45:34,507 --> 00:45:35,673
Is that what you want?

441
00:45:35,758 --> 00:45:36,883
No!

442
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,564
You missed out.

443
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,139
I swim.

444
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:52,101
What, sweetie?
We can't hear you.

445
00:47:52,186 --> 00:47:54,270
I love to swim.

446
00:47:54,355 --> 00:47:56,189
We're happy for you.

447
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,821
I can do it one more...

448
00:48:03,906 --> 00:48:05,281
One more time for what?

449
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:53,514
Shit.

450
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,099
You got her.

451
00:51:12,052 --> 00:51:14,679
Come on! Justin!

452
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:45,334
Thanks for cooking,
honey. It's good.

453
00:51:45,711 --> 00:51:47,587
It's a team effort.

454
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:52,508
Sit down. Stay with me.

455
00:51:55,596 --> 00:51:57,930
Okay. Sorry.

456
00:52:09,443 --> 00:52:10,693
Hello!

457
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:13,154
There's been an accident.

458
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:19,702
This is gonna
hurt. One, two...

459
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:22,747
Shit!

460
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:28,085
Shit!

461
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:34,091
Okay. The worst part's over.

462
00:52:34,176 --> 00:52:36,260
Just try and breathe
normally, okay? Deep breath.

463
00:52:36,345 --> 00:52:37,720
Deep breath, deep breath.

464
00:52:37,804 --> 00:52:42,433
I was just saying that despite everything,
we're having a pretty lucky day.

465
00:52:42,517 --> 00:52:43,559
Seeing your house...

466
00:52:43,644 --> 00:52:49,273
It's so beautiful. This kitchen
is just so squeaky clean.

467
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:54,070
And you being a
doctor, of course.

468
00:52:54,154 --> 00:52:58,366
Yeah, an ill-equipped one. You guys
should still go to the hospital.

469
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:02,495
Well, we don't really have the
best health coverage right now.

470
00:53:03,121 --> 00:53:05,414
Well, they still
have to treat you.

471
00:53:05,499 --> 00:53:07,708
Well, in that case,
can we bum a ride?

472
00:53:08,877 --> 00:53:10,628
Sure, there's
only one problem.

473
00:53:10,712 --> 00:53:14,298
Our daughter won't have the car
back till tomorrow morning. So...

474
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,761
Thank you, Mrs. Collingwood.

475
00:53:18,845 --> 00:53:20,012
It's Emma.

476
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:22,265
Thank you. You're welcome.

477
00:53:22,975 --> 00:53:26,102
Justin, sweetie, would you
like some hot chocolate?

478
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,690
Well, if he doesn't, it'll be a
first. What do you say, Justin?

479
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:35,027
Yeah?

480
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,863
Yes, please. Okay.

481
00:53:40,158 --> 00:53:42,868
Hold on to this.
Keep the pressure on.

482
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:45,955
Say, you think I could
use your landline?

483
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:47,623
Sure. Yeah, no problem.

484
00:53:47,749 --> 00:53:49,625
It's right there on
the wall. Here you go.

485
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:53,546
I gotta call us a tow truck and
maybe a cab to take us into town.

486
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,382
Are you sure that's
a good idea, Krug?

487
00:53:58,593 --> 00:54:01,804
I mean, do they
even have taxis here?

488
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:03,639
Yeah, they do.

489
00:54:03,724 --> 00:54:06,809
Good luck getting one to
come out here in this weather.

490
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:10,313
Well, they might,
honey. You never know.

491
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:13,566
Yeah, you never know, do you?

492
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,569
Yellow Pages are in
this drawer over here.

493
00:54:18,071 --> 00:54:19,322
Justin.

494
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:31,959
Okay, Francis, here we go.

495
00:54:33,712 --> 00:54:35,254
One second.

496
00:54:40,052 --> 00:54:41,510
Shit.

497
00:54:41,595 --> 00:54:43,095
Hold still.

498
00:54:55,734 --> 00:54:57,777
Shit, you gotta be
fucking kidding me.

499
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,029
Hey, Doc. Doc,
where's the needle?

500
00:55:00,113 --> 00:55:03,240
Don't move, okay? Don't move.

501
00:55:03,325 --> 00:55:05,159
Yeah, don't worry.

502
00:55:05,911 --> 00:55:08,162
That phone's dead, too.

503
00:55:08,246 --> 00:55:12,041
Yeah, it happens every time.
I'll just turn the generator on.

504
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:13,959
Sit tight, everyone.

505
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,777
So, you guys live
here permanently?

506
00:55:39,861 --> 00:55:42,571
Oh, no, no, no. We
actually live in the city.

507
00:55:42,656 --> 00:55:44,865
How many houses do you have?

508
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:51,914
So, what are you guys
doing out here anyway?

509
00:55:51,998 --> 00:55:55,126
I mean, this is kind of
in the middle of nowhere.

510
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,545
Are you on a family
vacation or...

511
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,887
Well, it's kind of
embarrassing actually.

512
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:12,768
My dad used to take Francis and
me to this lake every summer.

513
00:56:12,853 --> 00:56:16,105
Do some fishing,
a little camping...

514
00:56:16,189 --> 00:56:18,899
But now that he's gone,

515
00:56:18,984 --> 00:56:22,445
those memories are all that
I really have left of him,

516
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:26,824
and, basically, I'm just trying to
do the same thing for Justin here.

517
00:56:30,328 --> 00:56:33,873
I think that's important.
It's nice, making memories.

518
00:56:37,544 --> 00:56:40,129
Don't know if I want
to remember today.

519
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:46,218
You might. You never know. I mean,
you're all safe. You're together.

520
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,013
That's what counts.

521
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,891
Amen, Emma. Amen.

522
00:57:39,606 --> 00:57:41,607
Well, okay.

523
00:57:42,943 --> 00:57:46,946
Would you mind holding this for
me? Just hold it on his face.

524
00:57:47,989 --> 00:57:51,116
You all right? All
right, here we go.

525
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:53,410
Okay, just hold still.

526
00:57:58,166 --> 00:57:59,166
God.

527
00:58:01,795 --> 00:58:04,129
That fucking hurts!

528
00:58:08,969 --> 00:58:10,594
Man up, Frank.

529
00:58:11,137 --> 00:58:13,305
Fuck you. God.

530
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:19,937
Here you go, sweetheart.

531
00:58:21,523 --> 00:58:23,023
Thank you.

532
00:58:23,108 --> 00:58:24,900
And we're done.

533
00:58:26,486 --> 00:58:27,903
You better not be lying, Doc.

534
00:58:27,988 --> 00:58:29,655
I just have to
clean it off first.

535
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:33,951
Hey, Em, would you get the antiseptic
cream out of the drawer over there?

536
00:58:35,203 --> 00:58:37,246
It's gonna sting. What?

537
00:58:38,164 --> 00:58:41,417
Jesus, okay! I know. It's
okay. You're doing good. Okay.

538
00:58:44,337 --> 00:58:47,006
That's it. You're done.

539
00:58:47,841 --> 00:58:49,300
That's good.

540
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,635
Thank you, Emma.

541
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,266
Sure.

542
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:02,354
I'll... I'll get
you a coffee, too.

543
00:59:04,232 --> 00:59:06,191
Got anything stronger?

544
00:59:32,677 --> 00:59:33,969
Nothing.

545
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,680
Yeah, I figured.

546
00:59:36,765 --> 00:59:39,391
Looks like we're
still stuck here.

547
00:59:43,897 --> 00:59:45,773
Justin, are you okay?

548
00:59:47,067 --> 00:59:50,069
I've just never seen
him like this before.

549
00:59:50,904 --> 00:59:53,030
Well, maybe you
should lie down.

550
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,661
You know, you should probably
just sleep here tonight.

551
00:59:59,913 --> 01:00:02,414
Well, no, we couldn't do that.

552
01:00:04,751 --> 01:00:06,794
I don't think you
have much choice.

553
01:00:06,878 --> 01:00:09,630
We just don't want
to impose, is all.

554
01:00:11,091 --> 01:00:14,760
Well, it's really not a problem.
We have a guest house. So...

555
01:00:16,471 --> 01:00:19,431
Whatever you think.
Whatever's easiest.

556
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:23,727
Yeah, we're very easy.

557
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:32,695
Where's the bathroom?

558
01:00:32,779 --> 01:00:35,948
It's the last door on
the right. Down the hall.

559
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,994
Kitchen counter's fine.

560
01:01:24,539 --> 01:01:26,665
That's our daughter, Mari.

561
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,084
The car thief.

562
01:01:31,129 --> 01:01:32,838
Sorry... I'm...

563
01:01:36,217 --> 01:01:38,594
Justin, honey?
Justin, honey...

564
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,181
Are you okay? What's
wrong? I'm fine. I'm fine.

565
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:05,621
Hey, Justin, Dr. Collingwood
wants to know if you're doing okay.

566
01:02:06,915 --> 01:02:08,791
Yeah, tell him I'm fine.

567
01:02:11,586 --> 01:02:15,839
You keep your mouth shut, do you
hear me? Don't you fuck up again.

568
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:19,051
H urry up.

569
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:58,382
The neighborhood boys would try to jump
over our fence and steal our fruit...

570
01:03:02,846 --> 01:03:05,597
The dog would chase them out,
but my mom was scared of the dog.

571
01:03:05,723 --> 01:03:07,683
She took him to the pound.

572
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:40,465
We're being shown to our room.

573
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:28,805
So, the bathroom is in there.

574
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:31,475
And there should be some
stuff in the medicine cabinet

575
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:34,436
in case Justin starts
to feel sick again.

576
01:04:35,021 --> 01:04:38,941
But other than that, I think
we're pretty well-covered.

577
01:04:39,025 --> 01:04:42,986
So, unless you guys can think of
anything else, then I'll let you...

578
01:04:43,071 --> 01:04:45,072
Let you get your rest.

579
01:04:45,698 --> 01:04:48,784
Emma, please. You've
done more than enough.

580
01:04:48,868 --> 01:04:51,662
Go. Get some sleep
for goodness sakes.

581
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:57,584
Well, if you decide that you do need
anything, please don't hesitate to...

582
01:04:58,044 --> 01:05:02,047
Well, you can't really call,
but I guess just come over.

583
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,465
Will do.

584
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:06,635
Good night.

585
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:08,720
Good night. Good night.

586
01:05:08,805 --> 01:05:10,555
Good night, Emma.

587
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,236
I think she likes me.

588
01:05:50,388 --> 01:05:53,140
You get them all
squared away down there?

589
01:05:53,766 --> 01:05:55,851
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
01:05:56,602 --> 01:05:59,396
They're just so weird.

591
01:06:00,273 --> 01:06:03,483
Did you lock the
front door? No.

592
01:06:03,568 --> 01:06:07,112
I got it. Why don't you pour
us the rest of that wine?

593
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,295
Em? Yeah?

594
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:25,964
Did you hear that?

595
01:06:32,305 --> 01:06:34,264
Where's it coming from?

596
01:06:34,348 --> 01:06:37,142
Sounds like it's
coming from the porch.

597
01:06:59,665 --> 01:07:00,874
Mari!

598
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:03,460
Oh, my God!

599
01:07:09,217 --> 01:07:12,803
Okay, baby. I
got you. Sweetie.

600
01:07:12,887 --> 01:07:16,181
Oh, my God! Oh, my God. John.

601
01:07:17,517 --> 01:07:20,352
She's been shot! We
gotta get her inside.

602
01:07:24,357 --> 01:07:28,819
Hold her head. Hold her head. Give
me some room. Give me some room.

603
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,992
John, is she breathing? Baby?

604
01:07:36,077 --> 01:07:38,203
Come on, girl, let's go.

605
01:07:39,247 --> 01:07:40,872
John, come on!

606
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,503
Fuck! Oh, my God!

607
01:07:47,046 --> 01:07:50,590
No, no, no. That's
it. All right.

608
01:07:50,716 --> 01:07:52,717
Come on, Mari.
Can you hear me?

609
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:54,970
Mommy and Daddy are with you,
okay? You're gonna be okay.

610
01:07:55,054 --> 01:07:56,763
I gotta stop this
bleeding. Go get me a knife.

611
01:07:56,889 --> 01:07:59,307
John, what about the bullet? Stopping
the bleeding is more important

612
01:07:59,392 --> 01:08:01,726
than fishing for a fucking
bullet! Get me a knife now!

613
01:08:14,407 --> 01:08:15,907
John. John!

614
01:08:17,326 --> 01:08:21,413
And lots of towels, all right?
Whatever alcohol we have in there.

615
01:08:56,782 --> 01:09:01,578
Okay, sweet pea. This isn't gonna feel
good, but it's gotta be done. Okay?

616
01:09:07,126 --> 01:09:11,630
That's it, that's it, baby
girl. I know, baby, I know.

617
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:13,256
Almost done.

618
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:18,470
Almost done. Okay.

619
01:09:20,973 --> 01:09:22,807
That's it, that's
it. Brave girl.

620
01:09:23,976 --> 01:09:26,019
Okay, all done. That's it.

621
01:09:52,505 --> 01:09:54,089
Oh, God.

622
01:09:55,508 --> 01:09:57,509
You fucker.

623
01:10:00,179 --> 01:10:02,138
Mari? What's
that? What's that?

624
01:10:02,223 --> 01:10:05,600
I can't breathe. Okay, okay.
I'm gonna fix it, all right?

625
01:10:05,685 --> 01:10:08,478
That's easy, honey, all right.
Okay, I'm just gonna turn you over.

626
01:10:08,562 --> 01:10:10,355
That's my baby.
Just one second.

627
01:10:13,234 --> 01:10:16,027
Emma! I need a glass
of water, quick!

628
01:10:20,283 --> 01:10:23,201
There we go. Okay.
Just for a minute.

629
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:26,955
Mama's right here,
honey. That's it.

630
01:10:27,915 --> 01:10:29,749
Mama's here, honey.

631
01:10:33,337 --> 01:10:35,088
John, be careful. Okay.

632
01:10:35,172 --> 01:10:38,967
All right, sweet pea, now this
is gonna hurt a little bit, okay?

633
01:10:39,051 --> 01:10:41,052
But I promise you, you're
gonna breathe better.

634
01:10:41,178 --> 01:10:43,513
All right, here we go. Ready?
One... It's okay, baby. It's okay.

635
01:10:43,597 --> 01:10:45,223
...two, three.

636
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:48,018
I know. I know, sweetie,
you're almost there.

637
01:10:48,102 --> 01:10:50,729
I just need to let
a little air out.

638
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:54,149
That's it. That's
my girl. Okay.

639
01:10:54,233 --> 01:10:57,694
Okay, sweetheart.
Okay, that's it, baby.

640
01:10:57,778 --> 01:11:00,905
Hang on one sec. Just
gotta equalize the pressure.

641
01:11:01,073 --> 01:11:04,868
Okay, all right. That's it.

642
01:11:04,952 --> 01:11:07,370
It's okay, honey.
Just breathe.

643
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:11,624
Okay, there we go.
That's it, there you go.

644
01:11:12,752 --> 01:11:15,795
That's it, baby.
There you go. Okay.

645
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:20,884
Is that better? Now you can
breathe. That's all better now.

646
01:11:21,552 --> 01:11:26,181
That's my girl. There you
go. Yeah. It's okay, baby.

647
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:39,069
Can you tell me who
did this to you, huh?

648
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:42,280
Did you see him, sweetie?

649
01:11:44,617 --> 01:11:45,742
John?

650
01:11:45,826 --> 01:11:48,536
She's doing okay. She's stable. I
don't know how long it's gonna be,

651
01:11:48,621 --> 01:11:49,871
but we gotta get
her to a hospital.

652
01:11:49,955 --> 01:11:51,373
John. What?

653
01:11:52,792 --> 01:11:54,834
This was in the kitchen.

654
01:11:55,961 --> 01:11:58,338
Okay. Why? The kid.

655
01:12:00,257 --> 01:12:02,300
That kid put it there.

656
01:12:03,469 --> 01:12:05,970
John, Mari was wearing
this when she left.

657
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:08,973
She was wearing this
when she left today.

658
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:21,903
Fuck.

659
01:12:25,282 --> 01:12:26,366
Em.

660
01:12:29,203 --> 01:12:31,996
Em, she was raped.

661
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:34,499
No.

662
01:12:35,668 --> 01:12:37,961
No! No! There's blood...

663
01:12:39,213 --> 01:12:41,047
I'm so sorry.

664
01:12:41,132 --> 01:12:42,715
Motherfuckers!

665
01:12:43,384 --> 01:12:46,761
John, John, I've should've
seen it. I should have realized.

666
01:12:46,846 --> 01:12:50,014
He was just standing there looking at
her. He looked like a goddamn ghost,

667
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:53,977
he just was staring at her picture
on the fridge. Fucking knew it!

668
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:59,941
We are going to get her to a hospital,
okay? We are going to do this.

669
01:13:00,025 --> 01:13:01,025
They're still here.

670
01:13:01,152 --> 01:13:04,737
What if they come over here... You're
right. I know. I know. You're right.

671
01:13:05,406 --> 01:13:08,700
Which means we gotta
be ready. For anything.

672
01:13:10,202 --> 01:13:14,706
We have to be ready to
do anything. You hear me?

673
01:13:16,417 --> 01:13:17,625
Yeah.

674
01:13:18,502 --> 01:13:20,699
We don't have...
We don't have a car.

675
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,590
I mean, the nearest house
is six miles from here.

676
01:13:23,674 --> 01:13:25,842
How are we... By land.

677
01:13:26,886 --> 01:13:30,430
Six miles by land, okay?
We're gonna do this.

678
01:13:31,474 --> 01:13:35,143
I need you with me.
We are going to do it.

679
01:13:36,312 --> 01:13:38,271
Okay. Okay. Let's go.

680
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:39,898
Come on, sweetie.

681
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:45,487
All right, I need some tape. I gotta
tape... I gotta secure this tube. Okay.

682
01:14:18,771 --> 01:14:20,772
You awake in there?

683
01:15:09,446 --> 01:15:10,572
Shit!

684
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:41,287
Come here, baby. It's
okay. It's okay. It's okay.

685
01:16:41,413 --> 01:16:44,916
It's gonna be okay. We're
leaving very soon, I promise.

686
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,713
Em, where are the boat keys?

687
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hey.

688
01:17:23,789 --> 01:17:26,624
Sorry, I thought
you'd be asleep by now.

689
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:39,971
John's asleep.

690
01:17:40,848 --> 01:17:43,683
I'm the... I'm the night owl.

691
01:17:45,811 --> 01:17:48,688
Yeah, that last
lightning bolt woke me up.

692
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:53,526
Thought maybe a cold beer
might help. Knock me back out.

693
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:56,571
Do you mind? No,
wait. Wait, wait, wait.

694
01:17:59,158 --> 01:18:00,408
I...

695
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:06,497
I don't think a beer's
gonna cut it, you know.

696
01:18:07,666 --> 01:18:10,168
Not on a night
like this anyway.

697
01:18:13,464 --> 01:18:17,675
Well, what's gonna cut
it, Mrs. Collingwood?

698
01:18:19,136 --> 01:18:22,972
Well, I was thinking
of maybe a more...

699
01:18:25,142 --> 01:18:27,143
A more adult beverage.

700
01:18:29,354 --> 01:18:31,564
We fall into that category?

701
01:18:33,734 --> 01:18:35,526
Yeah, I think so.

702
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:42,909
All right, bartender. I guess I'll
have another hit of that whiskey then.

703
01:18:44,328 --> 01:18:46,579
John just polished that off.

704
01:18:47,706 --> 01:18:48,956
Really?

705
01:18:50,209 --> 01:18:51,959
That's impressive.

706
01:18:52,836 --> 01:18:55,880
So, he must be... He's
passed out upstairs.

707
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,763
You a wine drinker?

708
01:19:04,556 --> 01:19:06,557
I guess I am tonight.

709
01:19:07,434 --> 01:19:08,768
Yeah.

710
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:12,146
Here, let me go find one.

711
01:19:31,124 --> 01:19:33,960
So, is that rain
letting up any?

712
01:19:34,044 --> 01:19:38,589
No, not much. I think the
storm's gonna be here awhile.

713
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:47,515
So, you not finding
a good bottle?

714
01:19:50,102 --> 01:19:53,354
No, I... No, actually,

715
01:19:53,438 --> 01:19:56,941
I have one open in the
fridge. Let me just go get it.

716
01:20:10,747 --> 01:20:12,206
Here you go.

717
01:20:18,797 --> 01:20:21,173
Should I just chug it?

718
01:20:24,428 --> 01:20:26,804
God, I'm sorry.
Glasses, right.

719
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:35,521
Here, let me just pour
that for you. All right.

720
01:20:41,528 --> 01:20:46,490
You know, I can't thank you
enough for your hospitality.

721
01:20:48,994 --> 01:20:53,414
Well, you know, it's...
It's the least we could do.

722
01:21:12,351 --> 01:21:16,979
So, I noticed
you had a hot tub.

723
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:20,691
You get to use that much?

724
01:21:21,318 --> 01:21:24,111
No. Not too much lately.

725
01:21:31,244 --> 01:21:36,916
Of course, there's a fire.
It could use some stoking.

726
01:21:39,878 --> 01:21:43,339
Now that sounds
like a fine idea.

727
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:48,511
I'll get the wine.
I'll meet you in there.

728
01:22:07,781 --> 01:22:09,490
Son of a bitch!

729
01:22:44,151 --> 01:22:45,943
You fucking bitch!

730
01:22:47,112 --> 01:22:48,779
Who the fuck are you?

731
01:23:10,802 --> 01:23:11,969
Krug!

732
01:23:12,596 --> 01:23:15,598
Krug! Sadie!

733
01:23:17,184 --> 01:23:18,184
Shit.

734
01:23:28,653 --> 01:23:30,154
Get off me!

735
01:28:47,263 --> 01:28:48,514
Shit!

736
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:56,480
Jesus Christ!

737
01:29:28,847 --> 01:29:31,265
Who are you crazy fucks?

738
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:52,221
Fuck me, Francis.

739
01:34:08,501 --> 01:34:10,544
Hang on sweetheart, okay?

740
01:34:10,628 --> 01:34:14,798
We might have to do this
a different way, all right?

741
01:34:31,649 --> 01:34:33,942
Come on out, you
piece of shit!

742
01:34:43,661 --> 01:34:46,163
What are the odds, man?

743
01:35:01,179 --> 01:35:04,556
Of course, your little girl
had a lot to do with it.

744
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:08,226
You should be proud.

745
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,731
How'd you make us anyway?

746
01:35:16,527 --> 01:35:18,695
Did my fucking kid rat us out?

747
01:35:22,617 --> 01:35:25,702
That's it, isn't
it? My fucking kid!

748
01:35:30,082 --> 01:35:33,543
He figured out who you were
and blabbered his brains.

749
01:35:34,587 --> 01:35:39,090
Hey, by the way, you all did
a bang-up job on my brother.

750
01:35:39,175 --> 01:35:41,885
He is really fucking
dead down there.

751
01:36:26,973 --> 01:36:30,100
Well, well. What's this?

752
01:36:31,435 --> 01:36:34,104
This Emma down
here by the lake?

753
01:36:34,605 --> 01:36:37,732
You two planning a
daring escape at sea, huh?

754
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No! Emma!

755
01:37:45,343 --> 01:37:47,093
Did you find them?

756
01:38:10,785 --> 01:38:12,243
That hurt?

757
01:38:14,538 --> 01:38:15,580
Give you a hand!

758
01:38:33,432 --> 01:38:35,809
You should have seen yourself.

759
01:38:38,646 --> 01:38:41,481
Come on, is that
all you got for me?

760
01:38:44,026 --> 01:38:47,320
I was expecting a lot more
fight out of you, John.

761
01:38:50,241 --> 01:38:53,743
Mari and her little friend
sure gave me a lot of fight.

762
01:39:25,443 --> 01:39:28,111
You wanna hear
what I did to Mari?

763
01:39:30,614 --> 01:39:33,700
I bet you do, pervert.

764
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:45,628
You want to hear how tight your
little homecoming queen was?

765
01:39:53,304 --> 01:39:57,390
No, I want to hear you
beg for your fucking life.

766
01:40:05,733 --> 01:40:08,234
I don't feel like
begging today.

767
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:37,514
What are you doing?

768
01:40:43,437 --> 01:40:44,979
Ending this.

769
01:40:46,982 --> 01:40:50,693
Well, you sure picked a hell
of a time to grow some balls.

770
01:40:53,614 --> 01:40:55,532
Glad to see you, too.

771
01:40:57,201 --> 01:41:01,621
Look, I'm not mad, all right?
Just don't do anything stupid.

772
01:41:11,715 --> 01:41:13,383
My son.

773
01:41:15,803 --> 01:41:17,387
I loved you.

774
01:41:18,222 --> 01:41:20,473
I took care of you!

775
01:41:21,809 --> 01:41:23,059
Loved?

776
01:41:24,311 --> 01:41:26,396
You don't get to talk now!

777
01:41:27,064 --> 01:41:28,523
Fuck you!

778
01:45:15,667 --> 01:45:16,834
Hi.

779
01:45:18,128 --> 01:45:19,629
What is this?

780
01:45:21,131 --> 01:45:22,632
I can't move.

781
01:45:27,137 --> 01:45:29,764
You're paralyzed
from the neck down.

782
01:45:32,559 --> 01:45:35,144
I didn't have any
rope or duct tape.

783
01:45:41,652 --> 01:45:43,444
What are you doing?

784
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:45,488
Doc?

785
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:56,958
What the fuck are you doing?

786
01:46:06,802 --> 01:46:08,845
You're gonna be fine.

787
01:46:08,929 --> 01:46:10,138
Wait.

788
01:46:12,683 --> 01:46:13,850
Hey.

789
01:46:14,893 --> 01:46:16,060
Wait.
