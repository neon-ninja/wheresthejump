1
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:06,541
Ready?

2
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,958
There's no way.
- Mm-mm.

3
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,375
- This is ridiculous.
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,875
- That's actually impressive.
- You're kidding me.

5
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,250
- Cough it up, baby.
- Okay.

6
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,916
I'm gonna give you five.

7
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,208
I don't know how you do it, man.

8
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,166
- I'm just blessed.
- Hmm.

9
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,958
Thank you for contributing
to my slush funds.

10
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,583
Jesus.

11
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,875
Dude, this place is so disgusting.

12
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,166
Don't trash the bar. It's just bugs.

13
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,250
- You should get an exterminator.
- Yeah, that's above my pay grade.

14
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,333
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, geez.

15
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,166
You're such an asshole.

16
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,541
You know, they say when you see one,
there's thousands more in the walls.

17
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,958
- Shut up, Jeffrey.
- Yeah, shut up, Jeffrey.

18
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,625
Why don't you make me?

19
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,791
Make me shut up.

20
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,250
Don't mind me.

21
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,416
Trash coming through.

22
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,916
How you living, Eric?

23
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,375
- Large.
- Expect nothing less.

24
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,833
I'll be right down.

25
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,458
That shirt comes off,
you drink for free.

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,916
- No.
- Just saying.

27
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,041
- Oh, yeah?
- That's bar policy.

28
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,875
You get naked, it's free drinks all night.

29
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,375
Isn't that right, Mary?

30
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,666
Damn right.

31
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,625
I don't make the rules.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Come on. Give me a shot.

33
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,458
- Now we're talking. Now we're talking!
- Line 'em up.

34
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,541
Maybe you will see something
by the end of the night.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,416
Don't you tease me.

36
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,875
- Where you going?
- I'm just going to the bathroom, babe.

37
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,375
He seems like a good kid.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,791
He is a good kid.

39
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,875
Wonder how long this one's gonna last.

40
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,458
I'm kidding! Come on, look...

41
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,291
May you both live happily ever after.

42
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,208
Cheers.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,416
Nah, I'm going to wait for my boyfriend.

44
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,166
Your loss.

45
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,125
M'lady.

46
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,916
- Who the fuck are you, man?
- Whoa, whoa. Eric!

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,333
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hey! Eric! He's with me.

48
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,541
That's just Jeffrey, man.
You remember him.

49
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:50,833
Oh, yeah.

50
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:52,833
Oh, yeah.

51
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,791
- How you doing, brother man?
- Fine.

52
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,541
Thanks.

53
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:57,875
Good game.

54
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,625
Scored a goal. I'm here!

55
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:04,916
I was so close.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,666
If you break one more stool, Rosie's gonna
to make you stand while you're here.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
Long night?

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,458
- Just getting started.
- Yeah?

59
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,166
- Usual?
- Yes, please.

60
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,541
Coming right up.

61
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,750
You know what?

62
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,583
You go buy yourself a drink.

63
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,000
Wow. My man.

64
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:29,541
And drinks for the progressive couple
over there doing the smooching.

65
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,166
You're a real gentleman, Eric.

66
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,291
Oh, no, man. It's fine.
You don't have to do that.

67
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,708
Yeah. I know I don't have to.

68
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,375
I want to.

69
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,958
Thank you, Eric. We appreciate it.

70
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,250
Thank you.

71
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,291
Welcome.

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,250
That shirt better come off now.

73
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,000
Um... to, uh, Eric.

74
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,750
To Eric!

75
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,208
Cheers.

76
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,666
Oh, come on, Eric.

77
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,333
Everybody 21?

78
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,500
Yeah.

79
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,625
What about everybody else?

80
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:18,708
Yeah, man.

81
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,958
Want me to get them?

82
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,750
No.

83
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,833
Fuck it, you're fine. What do want?

84
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,458
Just beer. Four, please.

85
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,416
Just beer?

86
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:32,958
All right.

87
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,833
These are twist-off.
Y'all should be able to handle that?

88
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,083
Yeah, man. We can handle it.

89
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,041
You know those kids are underage, right?

90
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,583
Whatever. They're harmless.
Let them have their fun.

91
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,500
Hit me again, please.

92
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,666
Ah! Right, yep. My bad.

93
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,333
Jesus.

94
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,541
I swear, we got more bugs
than people in the bar tonight.

95
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,500
That's fucking gross.
Bugs were fucking on the whiskey.

96
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,166
- Thank you.
- There you go.

97
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,500
There you are.

98
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,500
What's up, brother?

99
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,166
- I'm all right, how are you?
- Good.

100
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,375
Give me a hug, dude.
Enjoying your last days of freedom?

101
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,083
- You know it.
- Good. Good.

102
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,291
What's going on?

103
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,791
You fellas, let me know
if you need anything else.

104
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,250
We're good for now, brother.

105
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,291
- Let's shot some pool!
- Pool!

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,666
- Hey, Mary.
- You wanna play?

107
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,625
He's been on a non-stop bender for a week.

108
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,125
He's back on the rig on Monday,
so I think we'll be safe.

109
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,708
Fuck you, Eric!

110
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,083
Hey, Mary!

111
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,250
Mary, come on. They're only kidding.

112
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,916
- Mary, wait.
- Kiss my ass, jerk.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,916
Where you going?

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,958
- You're breaking my heart.
- Hey, fellas!

115
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,000
Just be cool, all right?

116
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,375
- It's a family establishment.
- Sorry, Mom!

117
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,958
Fucking animals.

118
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,208
Hey, what'd I just say?

119
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:04,833
Well...

120
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,666
You're a dick, Eric.

121
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,958
Whatever, babe.

122
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,291
- What happened with Mary?
- He was shoving the cue in her face.

123
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,500
Should we get out of here, maybe? Like...

124
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,208
go?

125
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm sorry.
Can you get this man a drink, please?

126
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,375
Yes. Yes, I can.

127
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,375
No. No, no. I don't want... I can't...

128
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,250
- Technically, it's my job.
- I got a deadline. Gotta work. I'm tired.

129
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,833
No, no, no. I have a deadline, so...

130
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,208
Why don't you get wasted and write drunk?

131
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,583
That's what I'd do.

132
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,500
That doesn't sound like the best advice.

133
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,875
Got my ass through college.

134
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,791
Well, yeah, that was college.

135
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,500
You know he went to Tulane.

136
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,291
- Really? That's where I went.
- Yeah?

137
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,000
I think I was there a bit
before your time, sonny.

138
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,083
- When did you graduate?
- The year I dropped out.

139
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,875
Whoa!

140
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,500
Now what, bitch?

141
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,875
Eric, knock it off!

142
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,041
Eric!

143
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,458
Suck my dick, motherfucker.

144
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,833
Hey, Eric! Come on, man.

145
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,875
Someone get the bottle
out of that guy's hand!

146
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,291
Will, call the cops.

147
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,625
Motherfucker.

148
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,291
It's the bartender at Rose's.

149
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,833
We've got another fight breaking out.
Someone's gonna get hurt.

150
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,916
You wanna cut me? You wanna cut me?

151
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,000
Jeffrey, stop! Jeffrey, stop it!

152
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,166
Holy shit.

153
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,916
- Fuck!
- Jeffrey, stop!

154
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:56,750
Okay, okay, okay.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

155
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,041
Did you call the cops?

156
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,125
Yeah. Yeah.

157
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,916
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

158
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,083
You got him, all right?
You got him.

159
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,541
Dude, what the fuck?
What the fuck? Dude...

160
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,625
You gotta go to the hospital, man.

161
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,791
- You call the cops?
- Of course, I called.

162
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,958
- I shoulda called an ambulance.
- Fucking pussy.

163
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,500
Dude, you got...

164
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,583
Let's go.

165
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,333
Quit milking it, man.

166
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,125
- Let's get outta here.
- You're fine.

167
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,583
Here you go, man.

168
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:34,833
You all right?

169
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,375
Just fuck off, dude.

170
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,666
Yeah?

171
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,250
All right. Tell that to the cops
when they get here.

172
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,375
Grabbing a bottle in a fight
is chicken shit.

173
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,583
What the hell was that?

174
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,541
You're not a tough guy.
You coulda been hurt.

175
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,583
He coulda killed him, I mean...

176
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,375
- What else was I supposed to do?
- Yeah, okay.

177
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,250
- You did good, kid.
- Fuck.

178
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,375
You did good.

179
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,333
Oh, fuck.

180
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,250
It's probably one of the kids'.

181
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,416
Fucked up that they actually filmed
the whole thing.

182
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,416
Fucking millennials.

183
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,333
Anybody need a drink?

184
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,125
Hey, honey.

185
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,333
Guess who's home?

186
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,291
You feel like waking up?

187
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,000
Mm-mm.

188
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,083
Hmm?

189
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,541
Mm-mm.

190
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:21,166
Now stop fucking around.

191
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,541
Good morning, pretty little thing.

192
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,625
Well... Oh...

193
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,625
You're going to make me burn the eggs.

194
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,208
Whose phone is that?

195
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,625
Just some chick. She left it at the bar.

196
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,083
So you brought it home?

197
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,458
Just picked it up...

198
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,541
and forgot to leave it there.

199
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,666
There was bit of a fracas
at the bar last night.

200
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,625
Cool.

201
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,583
Thank you.

202
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,166
How's your paper coming?

203
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,291
I'm nearly there.

204
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,166
I just have to go over it again,
and probably rewrite the ending.

205
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,125
Turn it in to Steve and hope he likes it.

206
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,458
I'm sure he will.

207
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,416
He better. It's a quarter of my grade.

208
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,875
Yeah.

209
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,833
What are you gonna do today?

210
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,791
Don't know.

211
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,333
I don't have any plans.

212
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,458
Probably gonna check on Eric
at some point.

213
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,250
Why?

214
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,791
He's the one in the fight last night.

215
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,333
I thought you said it was a girl.

216
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,041
No, there was a group of college kids,
but when the fight started,

217
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,500
they got spooked and took off.

218
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,750
Eric got cut pretty bad, though.
It was brutal.

219
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,416
Well, that's not shocking.

220
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,041
I should probably go check on him.

221
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,625
What are you doing?

222
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,208
Trying to find out whose phone this is.

223
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,916
Why? Should I not look?

224
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,916
Am I gonna see something
I don't want to see?

225
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,750
No.

226
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,791
Why are you asking?

227
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:49,958
I don't know.

228
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,875
Why do you know how to unlock it?

229
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,083
From the smudge marks on the screen.

230
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,708
- I'm not lying about the phone, Carrie.
- Okay.

231
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,125
I believe you.

232
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,458
Oh! Fuck!

233
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,665
What?

234
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,165
What's wrong?

235
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,458
Who were you talking to last night?

236
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,541
What do you mean?

237
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,916
You were texting someone.

238
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,833
What is that, Will?

239
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,458
Jesus Christ.

240
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,833
Um...

241
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,208
Don't fuck with it.

242
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,291
Give it to the cops.
Somebody got hurt last night.

243
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,083
Yeah, someone could be fucking
with me, though.

244
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,125
Listen, it's...

245
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,291
Wednesday, so Duane will come in
after his shift. I'll give it to him then.

246
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,250
But what if that girl comes
to get it first?

247
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,000
Just say I don't have it.

248
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,208
Let's let the cops deal with it.

249
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,333
Okay.

250
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,083
Don't worry
your pretty little face about it.

251
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,791
You let your man handle things.

252
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,166
You're gonna make me late.

253
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,541
- Yeah, I am.
- I have to go.

254
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,708
- Mm-mm.
- Will...

255
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,875
you truly smell.

256
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,500
God!

257
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,416
He's only coming in
for that night,

258
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,333
so I said that we would have
dinner with him.

259
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,375
Ugh.

260
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,375
Dinner with your sober uncle?

261
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,833
What is the problem with that?

262
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,708
So he can fucking judge me the whole time.

263
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,916
What?

264
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,250
- Shit!
- God, Will.

265
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:03,958
Look at these guys.

266
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,416
Fucking here for a higher education,

267
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,125
can't figure out how
to cross a goddamn road.

268
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,833
You know what happens to idiots like that?

269
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,291
- You're gonna tell me.
- They spend four years here.

270
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,458
Four years becoming an economic prisoner.

271
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,708
He should just go work at Rosie's.

272
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,083
Get a real job.

273
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,041
I don't think he's Rosie's material.

274
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,416
No, he should stay here,

275
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,833
and fucking take lessons
from dillholes like that.

276
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:26,833
Hey, Steve.

277
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:29,875
Hi, Steve.

278
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,208
I'm gonna go learn from the dillhole.

279
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,583
- Yeah.
- See you later.

280
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,333
Love you.

281
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,583
Sorry I'm late.

282
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,333
How's it going?

283
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,708
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

284
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,416
- Come have a beer with me.
<i>- Babe, who are you talking to?</i>

285
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,666
<i>Fuck, dude. What time is it?</i>

286
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,000
It's like, 10:00 a.m.
What? Are you still sleeping?

287
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,000
<i>Yeah, I didn't get to bed until sunrise.</i>

288
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,750
<i> Hang up the phone, babe.</i>

289
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,375
You're gonna have a beer with me
or not? I'm pulling up to Rosie's.

290
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,625
<i> No, asshole, I'm not.</i>
<i>I'm gonna go back to sleep.</i>

291
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,916
When did you become such a pussy?

292
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,416
<i>That's so wrong. You know it.</i>

293
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,666
<i>You have one for me,
and I'll see you tonight, okay?</i>

294
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,875
All right.

295
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,083
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

296
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,041
What the fuck?

297
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,333
How's it hanging there, Rosie?

298
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,166
Oh, right and tight, loose, large.
Pick one.

299
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,041
Anyone come in looking for a cell phone?

300
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,625
Nope. Lost and found?

301
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:11,958
Yeah.

302
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,791
I heard what happened
with Eric last night.

303
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,333
Oh, yeah.

304
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,625
You should stop serving him
when he's fucked up.

305
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,166
He's always fucked up when he's home.

306
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,000
All right.

307
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,375
I can't leave the bar right now.
Can you go check on him?

308
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,000
Holy shit, Eric.

309
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,666
What is it?

310
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,375
You gotta go to the hospital.
I'm calling an ambulance.

311
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,875
- No, no, no.
- No, fuck that. Dude, your face.

312
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,000
Your face is fucked up!

313
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,083
I can see the inside of your mouth.

314
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,875
It's just swollen. That's all.

315
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,666
I don't know, dude.

316
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,791
I can get a buddy of mine to stitch it up.

317
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,125
A buddy of yours?

318
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,750
Come on, Eric.
You're not in fucking Afghanistan, dude.

319
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,500
Can't go to a hospital.

320
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,625
- They'll ask questions.
- Like what?

321
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,166
You wanna be able to eat food
without it falling out of your face?

322
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,208
What?

323
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:42,666
Nothing.

324
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:46,875
Thank your friend for me.

325
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,541
What friend?

326
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,125
The one who's banging your girl.

327
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,291
She's not my girl, dude.

328
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,458
Okay.

329
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,708
I just came to check on you.
I'll let you get your rest.

330
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,875
Hey, don't leave.

331
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,583
Nightmares.

332
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,833
Yeah. All right, man.

333
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,208
I'll stay for a little bit.

334
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,625
Hey, man, you got any more beer?

335
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,250
Mm-hmm.

336
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,250
Thank you.

337
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

338
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,666
Uh, $22.50.

339
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,125
Oh, wait.

340
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,375
Don't forget to buy your girlfriend
something pretty.

341
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:12,958
He'll love it.

342
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,625
Ooh! He looks good in them tights.
Yes, he do.

343
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,291
Next!

344
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,750
I thought you said you didn't want a beer.

345
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:34,458
I think I meant that I didn't want
to have a beer for breakfast.

346
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:35,791
Hmm.

347
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,208
Hey, Will.

348
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:38,875
Hey, Jeffrey.

349
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,166
You get your little project done?

350
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,875
Yeah. Um... turned it in this morning.

351
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,083
Just chilling now.

352
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,958
That's a gold star for you, then, right?

353
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:54,041
- You hear anything about Eric?
- Yeah, I went and saw him this morning.

354
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:56,208
His face is all cut to shit.

355
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:59,708
He's refusing to go to the hospital,
because he thinks he's Rambo.

356
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:03,166
You want to join us?

357
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:05,750
No.

358
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,583
No, no. I got to go.

359
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:10,208
I got a bunch of shit to do.
Just came for some to-go.

360
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,375
See you guys.

361
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,875
Hello?

362
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:55,625
Carrie?

363
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:17,666
Hmm.

364
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,916
<i>Monorail, up those stairs!</i>

365
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,666
<i>More of these clowns.</i>

366
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,166
Fuck off.

367
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:01,708
<i> That's amazing, dude.</i>

368
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,291
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I literally can't believe this.</i>

369
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,166
<i> Hey, stop goofing around.</i>

370
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,083
<i>Shut up.</i>

371
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:11,583
<i>- You think we did it right?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

372
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,583
<i>We did exactly what it said in the book.</i>

373
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:15,750
<i>Oh, my God. Look at the cockroaches.</i>

374
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,000
- <i>Fuck.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>

375
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:20,708
<i>Fuck!</i>

376
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

377
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:34,708
Will.

378
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:38,375
When'd you get home?

379
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:40,750
Right now?

380
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,583
What are you looking at?

381
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,375
Nothing.

382
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:47,000
I thought you were
going to bring that to the police.

383
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:48,500
I am.

384
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:49,708
I'll take it today.

385
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:51,083
What were you looking at?

386
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,041
Who's fucking phone is that?

387
00:30:58,458 --> 00:30:59,583
I told you, it's...

388
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,166
some chick from the bar.

389
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,250
One of the chicks from the bar?

390
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:08,666
I can't believe you're
still going on about this.

391
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,958
So, what?
All my friends just have to be guys?

392
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,375
Is that the deal?

393
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,833
What about Steve?

394
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,333
What about Steve?

395
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,041
You fucking talk about him all the time.

396
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:22,333
- He's my professor.
- And he obviously wants to fuck you.

397
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:25,208
You wanna check my phone?

398
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,541
You wanna go through my texts,
see if I sent him any pictures of my tits?

399
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:30,583
Go on, look at it.

400
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:32,000
No.

401
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,833
- Go on, check it.
- I don't want to.

402
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,250
I don't want to, because I trust you.

403
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:38,208
I want to trust you.

404
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:41,541
But you're being all shady
with some cunt's phone,

405
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:43,666
and you're acting guilty as shit.

406
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,083
Give it to me.

407
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,666
You don't wanna see it.

408
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,583
You don't wanna see it. It's awful.

409
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:09,250
Go to the last pictures.

410
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,333
Is that... Is this Garrett?

411
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:49,250
Is this who you were talking to?

412
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:51,458
I don't think so.

413
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,000
Those pictures were already on the phone.

414
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,500
- Call him.
- No.

415
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:03,000
- Then I'll call him.
- No, it's a bad idea. Don't.

416
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,500
I don't want to think about someone

417
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,875
dying like this,

418
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:09,500
and you'd ignored him.

419
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,791
I ignored him?

420
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,166
He was begging.

421
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,166
That's bullshit.

422
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,416
No one's dead. This is...

423
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,916
It's obviously some fucking nerd

424
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,666
who's into special effects.

425
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:49,791
Hello?

426
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:57,291
Garrett?

427
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,083
Ah!

428
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:16,833
No.

429
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,083
I'm going to call the cops.

430
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:24,791
Don't.

431
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:28,750
Listen, don't.

432
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:32,666
What are you doing?

433
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,375
I'll take it to Duane.

434
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,416
He's a friend. He'll take it seriously.

435
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,458
Do it right now.

436
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,000
Will, do it right now!

437
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,916
Fuck!

438
00:35:58,208 --> 00:35:59,583
Sir, are you okay?

439
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,416
Are you all right?
Want me to call somebody?

440
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:05,041
- What's wrong with him?
- The fuck is that?

441
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,958
I got your ass right on camera!

442
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,125
I don't see no blood.

443
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,416
- Crazy, man.
- Right?

444
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:13,708
That's crazy.

445
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:31,500
Fuck.

446
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:36,375
Fuck!

447
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:55,708
There he goes.

448
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,541
- 'Sup, baby? How you doing?
- Just another day. How are you?

449
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:00,291
Good. Beautiful day out there, right?

450
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:02,000
It's hotter than sin.

451
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,458
What happened last night?
Why didn't you call us?

452
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:08,291
I did. Took you guys
an hour and a half to respond.

453
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:11,166
No, man. I don't mean Fifth District.
I mean us.

454
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:13,625
I didn't know I could do that.

455
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:17,166
When last time Rosie's been hit
with an underage sting, huh?

456
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,541
Last time anybody followed up
on a noise complaint?

457
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,291
That's our bar, we protect the place.

458
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,625
Yeah, I know.

459
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:24,333
- 'Sup, Will?
- Hey, dude.

460
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,500
- How are you?
- Good, man.

461
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:28,625
Eric all right?

462
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,500
Yeah, he's okay.

463
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,333
- I checked on him this morning.
- Have a seat.

464
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,750
So...

465
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,958
what about the guy that did this?

466
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:39,291
I don't know.
I've never seen him before in my life.

467
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:41,666
Kind of figured it was
just something between them.

468
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,333
I tell you what. You see him, you call us.

469
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:49,500
I want to talk to him,
see how tough this bitch really is.

470
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:50,708
Yeah, okay.

471
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,583
There was also
these college kids at the bar,

472
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:55,833
and they left a cell phone there.

473
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,000
I went through it to see whose it was,

474
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:00,625
and I found some
really fucked up shit in there.

475
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:02,833
Like what, exactly?

476
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,875
There was a dead guy.

477
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,625
He looked murdered.

478
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,375
- Murdered?
- Yeah.

479
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:11,375
Where's the phone?

480
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:13,291
I lost it.

481
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,208
You lost it?

482
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,708
Yeah, on the way here.

483
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,125
But I think it was
those college kids, man.

484
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:20,625
I think they took it.

485
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:22,791
They've been following me around
in a black Charger.

486
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:26,500
I know it sounds crazy,
but my girlfriend saw the pictures, too.

487
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:27,958
I'm telling you guys the truth.

488
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:31,708
So, uh, you got a license plate
on this black Charger?

489
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:33,541
Yeah, yeah.

490
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:36,000
Uh, I think it started with a six.

491
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
A six?

492
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,958
Yeah.

493
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,125
That's it?

494
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:46,958
Yeah.

495
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:49,958
Okay, Will.

496
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:52,458
Look, man, if you, uh...

497
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,208
want to make a statement,

498
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:57,458
just give us all the details,
and we'll see what we can do.

499
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:58,750
Sure.

500
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,250
I need to go get the forms.

501
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,875
I hate when people touch
my shit on my desk.

502
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:05,708
We going to see you tonight?

503
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:12,166
Yeah, man. I'll be there. Same as usual.

504
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,708
Too much on it, man.
I put too much heat.

505
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,958
About to put heat on your ass.

506
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:32,541
- 'Sup, bitches.
- How's it going?

507
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,583
- What's up big hair?
- How's the main bitch?

508
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,416
What's shakin', bacon?

509
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,500
Not much.

510
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:41,166
It's quiet in here tonight.

511
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,250
Yeah, I finally get you all to myself.

512
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:45,166
Oh, ho, ho.

513
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,708
Speaking of, where's Jeffrey?

514
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,291
Punishing him.

515
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:52,250
He's being a jealous asshole.

516
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:54,708
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

517
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,333
Jealous of who?

518
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,208
None of your business, bartender.

519
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,166
Mm-hmm.

520
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,666
Mm-mm.

521
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,291
I'm just gonna do the one.
I'm trying to take it easy.

522
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:10,708
Why?

523
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:12,958
'Cause I don't wanna be wasted.

524
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,333
Then just don't get wasted.

525
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:17,000
Just do what I do, maintain the buzz.

526
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,166
It's like surfing, only more fun.

527
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,958
I don't think you should be telling me
how to drink.

528
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,208
I need to drink tonight...

529
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:30,875
and you're here.

530
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:33,125
So, you just became my backup.

531
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,458
What's wrong?

532
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:36,500
Nothing.

533
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:39,083
Just got some shit on my brain
I don't want on my brain.

534
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:46,500
I've also got an eight-ball in my pocket.

535
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,666
If you wanna play.

536
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,875
- Try to talk to it.
- Okay.

537
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:04,416
Just be like, "Hi, what's up?"

538
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,208
Like, whatever, we're so over...

539
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,625
That would've been
impressive if you caught it,

540
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:12,041
'cause you did extra flips.
That's extra brownie points.

541
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,416
Okay, just like easy, like,
"Hey, how you doing? What's up?"

542
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,541
It's been a while.

543
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:21,250
- That's too much.
- Yeah, she's playing hard-to-get.

544
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,625
- Try a different one.
- Okay.

545
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:23,916
- This one's Hubert.
- Okay.

546
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,166
He's much nicer. Try. Ready?

547
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,541
Boom!

548
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,458
- It's that easy. Really.
- It's like, finesse.

549
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:29,958
Yeah, just like I...

550
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,083
'Sup, yo!

551
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:33,708
Douglas.

552
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,333
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- William.

553
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:38,916
The fuck does it look like?
I fucking work here.

554
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,916
- You know that, come on.
- It's your shift already?

555
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,500
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

556
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,750
Y'all drunk, huh?

557
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,291
- You're drunk.
- Uh-uh. I'm handsome.

558
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,291
- You drunk.
- We both are drunk.

559
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,375
He's handsome.

560
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,291
I'll take it.

561
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:54,875
I don't wanna go to sleep yet.

562
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:56,416
I don't either.

563
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:02,458
- Don't do that.
- See. These are scheming fingers.

564
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:05,375
- What are you doing?
- Scheme, scheme...

565
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:08,833
Let's go to The Fly.

566
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,208
Let's kill this thing.

567
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,500
Okay, there you go.

568
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:18,625
Co-pilot responsibilities.

569
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:19,666
Oh, fuck.

570
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So much for cutting back.

571
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:27,250
Well, I guess there's always tomorrow.

572
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:30,333
That's the point, Will.

573
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:33,583
I'm almost 30,
and I'm wasting my life away.

574
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:36,000
No. I don't think you're wasting it.

575
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:37,541
I think you're living it.

576
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,958
I don't know.

577
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:46,541
Listen...

578
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:50,333
you're drinking tonight
because I asked you to drink,

579
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:51,666
so that's an exception.

580
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,916
You're basically drinking out of sympathy.

581
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,875
You're like a saint.

582
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:58,500
Canonized.

583
00:42:58,791 --> 00:42:59,750
Is that the word?

584
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:02,166
- Yes.
- Deified. No, that makes you a god.

585
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,166
You are a goddess. Let's be honest.

586
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,208
Can a god be a saint?

587
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:11,833
- Hey.
- Hmm?

588
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:16,916
You know if you ever need to talk to me
about anything, I'm here for you.

589
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:20,208
Yeah.

590
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:58,833
This is so nice.

591
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:01,791
It is.

592
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:04,875
There's no people.

593
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,000
I like no people.

594
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:17,750
God, you smell so good.

595
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:48,208
Will. Will. Will...

596
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:50,541
- Will, stop!
- What? What?

597
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,250
What? What's wrong?

598
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,875
You know what's wrong.

599
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:58,333
What is it? Jeffrey?

600
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,041
Yeah, of course it's Jeffrey.
Come on, Will.

601
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:03,166
Yeah, but why?

602
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:05,000
Why? I don't even understand it.

603
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:06,458
I don't know. Jesus.

604
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,958
I dunno. It's your girlfriend, too.

605
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:13,041
Yeah, but...

606
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,666
don't worry about her.

607
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:16,666
- Will, stop.
- Come on.

608
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,958
Will, stop it.

609
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:19,625
- Stop it!
- Fine.

610
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,458
We should just go.

611
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:02,208
She doesn't even love me anymore,
you know?

612
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:16,166
I'm sorry if she doesn't love you anymore.

613
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:22,916
That's true. I really am sorry.

614
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:20,291
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I'm on my way. I'll be back in...

615
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:15,666
Carrie?

616
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:29,625
Hello?

617
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:45,166
Hey.

618
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,666
Carrie.

619
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:51,083
You okay?

620
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:52,208
Hi.

621
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:54,958
What time is it?

622
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,916
What is that?

623
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,208
Nothing.

624
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,416
Did you just get home?

625
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:07,916
Yeah, I... stayed at the bar,
played a couple games of pool.

626
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,958
Let's go to bed.

627
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:11,916
Hey...

628
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:14,041
I found your phone on the floor.

629
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:16,166
Did you send me a picture?

630
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,125
No.

631
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,416
Maybe, I don't know...

632
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:28,833
I don't know. I feel foggy.

633
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:30,500
Are you drunk?

634
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,708
No, Will. I'm just really tired.

635
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:34,333
Come on. Let's go to bed.

636
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:36,541
Yeah, uh...

637
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:38,250
I'll meet you in there.

638
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

639
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Who the hell are you?

640
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,166
Garrett?

641
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:57,083
Hey, man. I'm really sorry I didn't help.
I thought you were kidding around.

642
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:02,833
There was a ritual.

643
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,000
We opened a portal.

644
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:11,541
Something came and possessed us.

645
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:15,708
You called it into your home.

646
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:20,833
Now it sees you are
the perfect vessel for more.

647
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:25,125
It is in your bedroom right now...

648
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:28,625
staring at you as you sleep.

649
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,500
Any news from Duane?

650
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,333
I told you,
they'd call if they heard anything.

651
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,750
Do they not care?

652
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:35,208
Of course they care, Carrie.

653
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,291
What was his reaction
when you showed him the pictures?

654
00:54:42,666 --> 00:54:43,708
I don't know.

655
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:44,875
He was shocked.

656
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,083
I googled that name...

657
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Garrett.

658
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,791
To see if there are any references
on Nola.com

659
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:59,125
of someone missing or being hurt,
but I didn't find anything.

660
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:01,375
Because we don't know
if anything happened to him.

661
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:04,875
I don't understand
how blasé you are about all this.

662
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:09,958
You didn't even want to bring it
to the cops in the first place.

663
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:11,916
God.

664
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:13,375
Fuck this.

665
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:24,500
People look so normal on the outside.

666
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,333
What are you talking about?

667
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:33,166
But on the inside, it's all just...

668
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,708
worms.

00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:21,166
I don't know what to tell you, princess,

684
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,250
By the way, man, how's Eric?

685
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:38,041
If one more fucking person
asks me about Eric, I swear to Christ...

686
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,958
Sorry, man.
People have been asking all day.

687
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,875
Any luck with those kids?

688
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,458
The ones with the cell phone?

689
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:51,041
No, man, sorry. Nothing.

690
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:53,250
You didn't really give us
much to work with.

691
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:55,291
Let you know if we find something.

692
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:00,666
Hey.

693
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:02,500
Jeffrey.

694
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:04,375
Where's Alicia?

695
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:09,125
Hey.

696
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:12,250
Uh...

697
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:14,291
Usual?

698
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,458
Just two beers this time.

699
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:18,500
Okay.

700
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:29,500
Need anything else, let me know.

701
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:39,833
Hey, bartender.

702
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:41,958
Bring me another beer.

703
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:46,458
I just brought you one, man.

704
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:50,291
That one's empty.

705
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:56,416
Doing all right there, Jeffrey?

706
00:59:59,583 --> 01:00:00,500
Hey, I'm good.

707
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:03,458
- Jeffrey...
- How the fuck are you, bartender?

708
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:04,458
Let's not do that.

709
01:00:06,791 --> 01:00:08,083
Got started early today, huh?

710
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:11,208
Bartender, why don't you
bring me another beer?

711
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,250
- You just got yourself cut off, my man.
- Bring me another beer!

712
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:16,958
Don't take that approach with me, Jeffrey.

713
01:00:17,041 --> 01:00:19,500
- Bring me another beer!
- You should get him the fuck outta here.

714
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:27,750
Pick that shit up, bartender.

715
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,416
You're not a tough guy, Jeffrey!
Quit fucking acting like one!

716
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,875
- Calm down, Will.
- Hey, Alicia! I'll call you later.

717
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:35,208
- Jeffrey! Calm down!
- You got a problem?

718
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:37,416
- I thought we were friends!
- Yeah, we are friends.

719
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,208
Get over here so I can give you a hug!

720
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:40,625
What's the matter with you, prick?

721
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:42,625
- Stop it!
- Hey, don't talk to him. Talk to me.

722
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:45,166
I don't want to talk to you.

723
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:51,833
Hey, was that guy crying?

724
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:56,833
Yeah, he was,
'cause he's a little fucking bitch.

725
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

726
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:04,291
Will?

727
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:06,833
Will!

728
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,416
Will!

729
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:24,458
Another beer?

730
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:25,833
No.

731
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:28,916
Bourbon, neat.

732
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:44,416
I thought you had a stroke or something.

733
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,875
- Damn!
- Shit!

734
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,125
Watch the bar!

735
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,583
<i>This is Carrie.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

736
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:27,583
Fuck!

737
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:38,458
They're fucking in here.

738
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:52,000
Carrie?

739
01:03:53,916 --> 01:03:54,833
Carrie!

740
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:56,791
Fuck.

741
01:03:58,208 --> 01:03:59,458
Is anyone else in here?

742
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:13,458
Carrie.

743
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:16,166
Hey, Carrie.

744
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,791
Carrie, are you okay?

745
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:19,125
Hey.

746
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:21,625
Fuck.

747
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,958
Oh, fuck. Jesus Christ.

748
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:27,291
Hey.

749
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:28,791
Is there anybody else in here?

750
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:31,750
Carrie!

751
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fuck!

752
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:31,666
Whoa.

753
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:38,291
Hey! Hey! Are you okay?

754
01:07:38,666 --> 01:07:39,916
Don't touch me!

755
01:08:23,582 --> 01:08:25,332
Shouldn't you be at work?

756
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:27,457
Yeah.

757
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:33,000
Why did you come home?

758
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:39,250
Do you not remember
anything that happened tonight?

759
01:08:41,582 --> 01:08:44,707
I was looking online for something.
I was doing research.

760
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:47,916
And then I...

761
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,332
I don't know. It's hard to think.

762
01:08:50,416 --> 01:08:52,041
Was there anyone else here tonight?

763
01:08:55,957 --> 01:08:57,541
I think there was.

764
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,375
Oh, my God. I think there was.

765
01:09:05,332 --> 01:09:06,207
Who?

766
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:08,332
I don't know.

767
01:09:08,416 --> 01:09:09,916
You sent me a picture of him.

768
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:17,332
No.

769
01:09:19,666 --> 01:09:21,875
I don't even remember
sending you that.

770
01:09:32,832 --> 01:09:34,166
- <i>Will!</i>
- Hey.

771
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,666
Doug.

772
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,916
<i>Yo. What the fuck, man?</i>

773
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:39,666
<i>Look, are you okay?</i>

774
01:09:39,957 --> 01:09:40,832
Yeah.

775
01:09:41,207 --> 01:09:43,541
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be in tomorrow night.

776
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:45,082
If I still got a job.

777
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,750
<i>Relax. We got you covered.</i>

778
01:09:47,832 --> 01:09:49,500
<i>Just do what you need to do.</i>

779
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:52,707
Thanks, man.

780
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:55,666
<i>It's no problem at all.
That's what friends are for.</i>

781
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:57,250
All right.

782
01:09:57,916 --> 01:09:59,291
Hey, I appreciate it, man.

783
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,125
Bye.

784
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:03,458
<i>And your boy Eric called down here, man.</i>

785
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:05,583
Wait, sorry. What'd you say?

786
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:09,083
<i>I said Eric called down, asking for you.</i>

787
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:10,583
<i>I told him you went home early.</i>

788
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:13,208
What did he want?

789
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:16,166
<i>I don't know. Said something
about giving you a present.</i>

790
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,750
<i>I gave him your number, though.</i>

791
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,666
<i>Probably a booty call.</i>

792
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:24,083
<i>Look, I don't judge, brother,
but I knew that's what it is.</i>

793
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:25,416
All right, gotcha.

794
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:19,625
<i>Hey, Will.</i>

795
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:21,416
<i>You shouldn't call here.</i>

796
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,875
So, you told him, huh?

797
01:11:26,541 --> 01:11:27,500
<i>Yeah.</i>

798
01:11:28,916 --> 01:11:30,458
<i>Yeah, I didn't mean to.</i>

799
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:34,625
<i>Maybe I did. I don't know.
I thought we could go back to normal.</i>

800
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:35,875
<i>I was stupid.</i>

801
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:40,416
Is he there now?

802
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:43,208
<i>Yeah. He's in the other room.</i>

803
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:44,625
You sure it's a good idea?

804
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:45,958
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

805
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,791
<i>Look, I can't talk to you right now.
I have to go, okay?</i>

806
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:53,208
<i>Goodnight, Will.</i>

807
01:12:05,541 --> 01:12:06,500
What the fuck?

808
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
We really need to do something about that.

809
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:22,583
I think we should break up.

810
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:25,375
I don't think this is working.

811
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:32,833
Okay.

812
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:36,875
That's all you got?

813
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:38,666
"Okay"?

814
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,333
Why are you acting offended?
You're breaking up with me.

815
01:12:46,541 --> 01:12:49,166
I can't believe how calmly
you're taking this whole thing.

816
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,375
I guess you can probably find
a place to crash

817
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:58,333
while you look for a new apartment, right?

818
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,083
Already? Today?

819
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:08,541
What did you expect? That we'd cuddle?

820
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:10,208
Fuck you.

821
01:13:11,958 --> 01:13:13,125
I'm sorry.

822
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:18,750
It's just this whole thing with the phone,
and the pictures.

823
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:21,458
It's dangerous.

824
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:24,333
And I don't want you anywhere around it.

825
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:25,708
Really?

826
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,583
Are you a hero now?

827
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:30,708
Come on, Carrie.

828
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:32,666
Do you hear yourself?

829
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:36,666
You're scared.

830
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:39,375
I'm scared, too.

831
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,000
But I would never abandon you to it.

832
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,458
That's not what I'm saying.

833
01:13:44,541 --> 01:13:45,458
Fuck you.

834
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:49,541
I wasn't mad until just now.

835
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:51,750
I was disappointed.

836
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:53,458
I was hurt.

837
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:56,416
But now, I'm just fucking pissed.

838
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,083
So, if that's what you wanted,
then, you got it.

839
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:01,833
It's not what I wanted.

840
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:05,000
You know what I think you want?

841
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,541
Nothing.

842
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:13,541
Because there's nothing there to satisfy.

843
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:18,791
You are a mock person.

844
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,666
You're just a body.

845
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:33,375
You okay?

846
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:38,083
Fucking Doug say something?

847
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:39,625
No.

848
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:43,416
Did something happen?

849
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,041
Nope.

850
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,416
Well, you look like shit.

851
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:54,500
Have you even showered today?

852
01:16:00,208 --> 01:16:01,250
Hit me again.

853
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:03,666
I don't think that's a good idea.

854
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:06,375
Your shift starts soon, anyway.

855
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:08,791
I'm a grown ass man.

856
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,458
Do I need to worry about you?

857
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:15,625
Nope.

858
01:16:16,291 --> 01:16:17,583
You really don't, Rosie.

859
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:35,333
- Oh! I'm sorry!
- Motherfucker!

860
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:36,833
I can buy you another drink, man.

861
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,750
- I don't want your drink!
- Hey!

862
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:39,708
No problem, man.

863
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:49,041
What's gotten into you?

864
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,916
Go home.

865
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:54,208
Take a shower.

866
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,625
Get your head straight.

867
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:56,708
What about my shift?

868
01:16:56,791 --> 01:16:58,666
Don't worry about it.
I'll cover you for tonight.

869
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,375
I don't want you to.

870
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:02,750
I don't want you to.

871
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:04,708
Well...

872
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:07,208
Fuck you, Rosie.

873
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:12,458
Excuse me?

874
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,208
Fuck me?

875
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:16,583
Fuck you.

876
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:19,791
Do you want to keep this job?

877
01:17:20,041 --> 01:17:21,250
Fuck your job.

878
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,125
<i>Hey, it's Alicia. Leave a message.</i>

879
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:40,750
Alicia, it's me. It's important.

880
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:42,708
I need you to call me back.

881
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,250
I know you're getting these messages.

882
01:17:48,333 --> 01:17:49,250
Fuck!

883
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,125
Eric.

884
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:30,208
Christ.

885
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:34,750
Eric?

886
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:43,000
Eric?

887
01:19:47,041 --> 01:19:48,208
Eric, you in here, man?

888
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,625
How you living, man?

889
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:14,791
Did someone break in here?

890
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:17,500
What do you want?

891
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,083
Just checking on you, man.

892
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:24,708
I'm good.

893
01:20:27,791 --> 01:20:29,625
I gotta crash here for a few days.

894
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:35,125
I gotta stay on your couch...

895
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:36,791
for a day or two.

896
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:41,583
No.

897
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,208
I'm up against a wall, man.

898
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,666
No!

899
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,000
I'm gonna clean up
around here a little bit.

900
01:20:58,291 --> 01:20:59,291
It'll be good.

901
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:02,041
Don't worry about it.

902
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:26,000
<i>I said you shouldn't call here.</i>

903
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:29,125
Yeah, but that was last night,
when you were with Jeffrey.

904
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,750
Where are you now? Are you okay?

905
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:34,625
<i>Will, I'm trying to fix my life, okay?</i>

906
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:37,875
<i>I need you to stop calling me.
It's not helping.</i>

907
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:39,041
Wait.

908
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:40,958
I left Carrie.

909
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:44,833
I broke up with her this morning.

910
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:49,583
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

911
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:54,291
<i>I'm sorry to hear that, Will.</i>

912
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,541
No, that's, that's good news... right?

913
01:21:57,916 --> 01:22:00,333
<i>- I don't know. That's up to you.</i>
- Wait, don't. Alicia...

914
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:01,833
<i>Will, I'm with Jeffrey.</i>

915
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
<i>I love Jeffrey. Do you understand that?</i>

916
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:07,916
No.

917
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:10,458
No, I don't understand that at all.

918
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:12,500
<i>I don't know when
we're coming back to the bar.</i>

919
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:14,000
<i>Maybe not for a while, okay?</i>

920
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:16,166
<i>Don't call me back.</i>

921
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:19,541
<i>If you really care about me,
you cannot call me back.</i>

922
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:09,708
You can't be in here.

923
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:13,458
You hear me?

924
01:23:15,333 --> 01:23:16,625
I don't want you here.

925
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:21,250
Didn't you call me?

926
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:26,958
No.

927
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:35,041
Someone called the bar last night
from this number, looking for me.

928
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:38,375
If it wasn't you, who the fuck was it?

929
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,375
They made me do it.

930
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,583
Those freaks.

931
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,125
Was it the fucking college kids?

932
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:49,041
Was it?

933
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,750
They told me to give you a present.

934
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:53,416
Now get the fuck off me!

935
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:55,833
I'll kill you.

936
01:23:57,291 --> 01:23:58,416
I'll kill you.

937
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:19,666
What's the present, Eric?

938
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,750
Are you the wrapping?

939
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:25,625
You can feel it moving around in there.

940
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:27,875
Can't you?

941
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:28,958
Please leave.

942
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:30,833
Shh.

943
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:33,125
Most people don't know you.

944
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,416
They don't see the evil

945
01:25:36,083 --> 01:25:38,000
and the ugly in your heart.

946
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:44,958
You have to be dead first...

947
01:25:48,291 --> 01:25:50,625
or will they rip you open
while you're still alive.

948
01:25:56,666 --> 01:25:58,541
I wonder what would happen if I called it.

949
01:27:25,583 --> 01:27:29,291
Don't do it, please.
Don't do it! Don't do it! Don't do it!

950
01:27:31,083 --> 01:27:32,083
Don't do this.

951
01:27:58,541 --> 01:27:59,750
Fix me.

952
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:02,708
Make me whole.
