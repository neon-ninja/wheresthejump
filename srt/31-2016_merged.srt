00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,925
Hello.

2
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,400
They call me Doom-Head.

3
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,610
Now, I don't call myself Doom-Head,
mind you, but they do.

4
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,531
Who's they?

5
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,960
Well, some mysterious folks...

6
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,920
that pay me a whole lot
of scratch to do what I do.

7
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,164
And what I do, unfortunately for you...

8
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,808
I do real well.

9
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,280
Now.

10
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,723
Let's get one thing between us straight.

11
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,322
I ain't no fucking clown.

12
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,320
Now, Mr. P.T. Barnum
may claim clowns are the pegs...

13
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,051
on which this circus is hung...

14
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,931
but I ain't no fucking clown.

15
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,360
You may think you see a grease-painted
performer sitting before you...

16
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,160
who would usually elicit
an amused response from an audience...

17
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,651
but trust me...

18
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,330
you do not.

19
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,125
I'm not here to make you happy.

20
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,080
I'm not here to brighten
your dismal day...

21
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,927
and I am certainly not here
to elicit an amused response.

22
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,047
I am here to end
your miserable fucking life.

23
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,131
But first...

24
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,800
First...

25
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,451
I'm gonna bless you with a story.

26
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,840
See, I don't think the last sound
to puncture your ear drums...

27
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,360
should be the twang
of your body falling apart.

28
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,646
Snap.

29
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,171
Crunch.

30
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,162
Interesting fact...

31
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,400
did you know that a cockroach...

32
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,007
can live up to 168 hours without a head?

33
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,880
I know.

34
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,761
I find this... fascinating.

35
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,760
But what really blows
my fucking marbles...

36
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,920
like a 50-cent skank...

37
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,880
I mean the real mind-fucker...

38
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,760
is that for several more hours
this same decapitated head...

39
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,969
will keep on trucking for Jesus.

40
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,370
If properly nourished, of course.

41
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,806
You know, all in all,
you've got a pretty good run.

42
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,400
But deep down inside...

43
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,245
you must have known
it all had to end somewhere.

44
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,920
Might as well be here.
Might as well be now.

45
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,080
And it might as well be with me.

46
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,280
Where's my wife?

47
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,682
What did you sick bastards do
to my beautiful wife?

48
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,320
She's the mother
of our two beautiful girls.

49
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,440
Rebecca, Josephine, they're beautiful.

50
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,090
They're just like her, please.

51
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,251
I know where she is.

52
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,851
Two little clowns I know
took a fancy to her.

53
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,800
So I think she might be
sticking around for a bit, huh?

54
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,080
...though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death I fear no evil...

55
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,000
Christ almighty...

56
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,041
you Jesus freaks
are so fucking sensitive, huh?

57
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,367
Shit.

58
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,480
You should be thanking me, man.

59
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm sending you straight
to the fucking pearly gates...

60
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,288
with a first-class ticket.

61
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,847
I should apologize in advance
for not sharpening this thing.

62
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,320
It might take a couple of extra whacks.

63
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,720
Listen to me. Listen to me.

64
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,680
Please, I'm begging you. I'm begging you.

65
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,560
You don't have...
You don't have to do this.

66
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,520
You don't... You don't have to do this.

67
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,880
We can both walk away.

68
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,520
Bring Georgina to me.

69
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,360
And you let us walk away,
no one would know.

70
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,840
- Fuck it.
- No, no!

71
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,240
You know what they say, Kimosabe.

72
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,322
In Hell...

73
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,846
everybody loves popcorn.

74
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,121
Motherfucker.

75
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,724
Number fucking two.

76
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,603
Hey, Randy, man, I hope you know
that "E" stands for "empty", not "eat."

77
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,760
I am hungry, but that's not possible.

78
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,524
Check it.

79
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,000
Suck my motherfucking balls.

80
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,960
No, thanks.

81
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,840
How am I supposed to work
with this inferior goddamn equipment?

82
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,968
Is that what the ladies
are calling it now?

83
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,921
Trust me, my doo-wally's working fine.

84
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,450
Hey, look here boy...

85
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,960
if this monster break down
here in the ass of nowhere...

86
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,960
you gonna get your lard ass
out there and you gonna push...

87
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,520
with the bumper up your ass.

88
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,280
Venus, I think it might be time...

89
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,600
to bring back the girl
into a gorilla illusion.

90
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,240
- You all got a gorilla?
- Yeah, I got a fucking gorilla.

91
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,400
He's in my pants. I call him King Dong.

92
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,320
Hey, filly.

93
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,160
- I assume you're joking.
- I am not.

94
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,280
And haven't we got enough
to worry about...

95
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,960
without you framing up a new show?

96
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,647
I mean, besides,
who's gonna hustle this other shit?

97
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,320
You think I want to be a fucking mechanic?

98
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,209
Fixing these death traps
the rest of my life?

99
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,160
I mean, I got dreams.

100
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,320
And they do not include yanking
some kid's chewed up arm...

101
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,160
out of the gears of a Tilt-a-Whirl.

102
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,400
Baby, I got dreams, too. You go for it.

103
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,840
Get the fuck off me.

104
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,880
Hey, baby girl...

105
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,960
I mean, what do you think
about that talent back there?

106
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,880
I mean, the one
with the lop-sided high beams.

107
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,200
I mean, I don't know
if she's drunk or retarded.

108
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,800
Seriously?

109
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,283
She's gonna twitch and itch
her ass all around the mid-way.

110
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,720
Just like all the new babies do.

111
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,768
But that's why I afraid.

112
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,166
A new wave of crap's coming.

113
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,880
So what exactly is the name
of this show of yours?

114
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,760
Okay, dig this.

115
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,323
Professor Ghouldini's
Mad Gorilla Monster Show.

116
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,040
I'd go see that show.

117
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,480
The name's got some grab...

118
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,040
but you're still minus one jungle girl.

119
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,400
I could be a jungle girl.

120
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,840
I took a acting class
before I left high school.

121
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,570
Just shut the fuck up for two seconds.

122
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,048
That's where Charly girl comes in.

123
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,520
Charly hardly looks like
a wild woman of Borneo.

124
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,040
And besides, you know that she is
my main hustle in the girly show.

125
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,280
Okay, we dump the whole Borneo shit, okay?

126
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,960
We work a new angle.

127
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,120
The yokels had burnt out
on that yarn ten years ago.

128
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,360
What's a yokel?

129
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,320
What's the word on this wacky weed...

130
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,960
this fine sunny, sunny day,
sweet Charly girl?

131
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,410
The Midwest says sweet Charly,
she got some sweet Rasta shit.

132
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,280
My sweet Charly...

133
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,249
pass your brothers a hit.

134
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,600
It ain't mine, baby.

135
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,880
Yeah, baby boy.

136
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,800
I got to keep my eyes on the road.

137
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,041
This shit's the real deal.

138
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,240
Think you two can handle it?

139
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,924
I try, I try.

140
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,440
First hit's free.

141
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,000
After that you lay out the green...

142
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,402
before Charly gets too mean.

143
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,721
Shit, woman, I'm good for it.

144
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,242
Levon, I got to get in there.

145
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,960
- Levon.
- Go away.

146
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,720
Hey, it ain't the Levon show.

147
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,840
- Go away.
- Come on, man.

148
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,480
I just got to get something out of the...
I got to get...

149
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,320
Goddamn, man, can't you see
I'm busy back here?

150
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,520
Shit, that's a lot of woman.

151
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,126
Yeah, what you want that's so important
you got to crash my love den?

152
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,000
You're going to give
that man a heart attack.

153
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,163
Tell it again, I don't get it.
Who had the cake?

154
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,520
Christ, bitch, pay attention this time.

155
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,520
There was a boy named Harold.

156
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Walked in on his grandparents having sex.

157
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,040
Pretty much like this asshole
don' walked in on me.

158
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,520
Harold said, "Grandma!
What are you doing?"

159
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,604
Grandma say, "Well, we baking a cake.

160
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,482
A few days later, Harold say...

161
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,120
"Grandma, was you and Grandpa
baking a cake last night?

162
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,480
Grandma says, "Matter of fact, we was.

163
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,000
How do you know?"

164
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,520
Harold say, "Because I just licked
some frosting off the couch."

165
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,720
I still don't get it.

166
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,400
The frosting, where did it come from?

167
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,760
The old man's dick.

168
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,286
The old bastard's jizz was the frosting.

169
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,131
Hello, Congo. How I missed you.

170
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,880
Come on, Roscoe,
go get your ass out of here.

171
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,840
I'll get out in a second.
What do you think?

172
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,320
I think it's cute. It isn't cute.

173
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,845
So do I.

174
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,720
Rosco, get your ass out of here.
You got to go, now, man.

175
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,160
Go on, man. Goddamn.

176
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,200
- Spoiled the...
- Come here.

177
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,360
Hey, see?

178
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,091
It still looks boss. Okay?

179
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,440
- Okay, I'll think about it.
- I just have to clean it up a little.

180
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,126
I'll think about it, King Dong,
I'll think about it.

181
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,480
Hey, oldie.

182
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,760
Got any gas today?

183
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,080
It's a cock-sucking gas station, ain't it?

184
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,686
All right then, fill up
this big bitch pronto.

185
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,000
Any of you dumb cunts...

186
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,080
in that ridiculous machine
know how to read?

187
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,891
Or are you still using sign language?

188
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,406
Yeah, old man, I know how to read.

189
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,440
Then read it and weep, genius.

190
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,200
Bad sign.

191
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,648
Got a whole lot of lazy effers here
in this world, man.

192
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,720
You digging what you see, pops?

193
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,609
I reckon I do.

194
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,402
You can call me Leo.

195
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,280
Lucky Leo, if you know what I mean.

196
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,000
Really? Do you feel lucky?

197
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,440
I got a mattress out back...

198
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,488
and a couple of jugs of gut burner.

199
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,560
Trust me, Leo.

200
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,291
Your prehistoric ticker
couldn't survive the ride.

201
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,840
Charly...

202
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,080
Stop fucking with the locals.

203
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,680
Give me a break.

204
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,762
I'm just making friends.

205
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,200
You want to be my friend, don't you, Leo?

206
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,089
You know I do.

207
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,726
See? Just making friends.

208
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,324
You've had enough friends for a lifetime.

209
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,880
Nice puppets, Leo.

210
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,405
You play with that stuff?

211
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,566
I bet you do.

212
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,120
The good Lord pray me for every day

213
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,885
He want me to leave a righteous way

214
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,080
So I don't care what the white man say

215
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,880
Santa Claus is a black man

216
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,800
You know, I'm thinking man,
when we get ourself a break...

217
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,040
we need to check out
the sound system in the carousel.

218
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,521
Man, them speakers, man,
they shot up to shit.

219
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,560
Seriously though, it looks like
I'm losing my shit.

220
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,280
I don't normally have this much forehead.

221
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,885
Too young for that.

222
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,040
Hey, man, look, it gonna do
what it gonna do.

223
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,640
Yeah, but that's easy for you to say.

224
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,800
Shit take a goddamn nuclear blast
to damage that foxy do of yours.

225
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,160
My shit goes south.
I can't do no Isaac Hayes.

226
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,600
Will you teach us something?

227
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,640
I'm gonna teach you something.
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.

228
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,480
There's only four things
you need to know about this career.

229
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,520
This is the answer to it all!

230
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,840
All right.

231
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,960
Sucky, sucky, sucky.

232
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,320
Fucky, fucky, fucky.

233
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,483
Juicy, juicy, juicy.

234
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,444
Money, money, money!

235
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,922
Hey, sailor.

236
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,486
How many seaman you got in that tin can?

237
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,600
Too many.

238
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,520
Why, you need a lift?

239
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,240
Maybe.

240
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,480
I could fit in very tight spaces.

241
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,404
I bet you can.

242
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,489
So can I.

243
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,840
Y'all headed up Jackson way to go hunting?

244
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,720
No, we're just plowing straight
on through to Harleyville.

245
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,970
Planning on doing some hunting?

246
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,323
No. Why are you so concerned
with me going hunting?

247
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,160
Just wondering.

248
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,360
You got that domineering
great white hunter vibe.

249
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,681
Yeah, it just comes natural.

250
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,480
But we ain't got nothing
about any firearms on this truck...

251
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,164
other than a busted old shotgun.

252
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,680
What's it for?

253
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,127
Propping open the air vent.

254
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,760
What if you get in a jam?

255
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,968
Well then I guess I...

256
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,120
bust out my old trusty crowbar...

257
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,488
and back it up with one of these guns.

258
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,010
Pop. See you later, Popeye.

259
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,685
I'ma go get me some spinach.

260
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,971
Yeah, you are.

261
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,560
That's the Moon Man Halloween Party...

262
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,530
on the night that was made for howling.

263
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,720
...we bring you the Wolf Man Jack...

264
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,640
Make-Believe Graveyard Ball.

265
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:33,090
Starring the leader of the gang
at the fang, Wolf Man Jack.

266
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,921
Oh, boy. Good evening and...

267
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,560
Oh, shit.

268
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,080
What the fuck is this shit?

269
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,721
...we got our big
Monster Mash Party going here.

270
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,048
Yo, Fats, why are you stopping?

271
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,120
Just because some hillbilly
sets up a Halloween la-la...

272
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,120
in the middle of the goddamn road.

273
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,680
- Move this shit to the side of the road.
- Why me?

274
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,680
Come on, man, you know it's easier
for you to get out than it is for Randy.

275
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,888
Thank you.

276
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,320
Mr. Monkey, I'll go with you.

277
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,960
You ought to know what man checks you.

278
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,725
Hey, Panda, wake up.
Come on out and help us.

279
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,290
Jesus Christ, every time
I get comfortable.

280
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,361
I'm telling you
this is one big-time party.

281
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,641
What the hell is this?

282
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,810
This voodoo, man.

283
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,730
Voodoo schmoodoo,
let's move this stuff off.

284
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,563
Come on, go.

285
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,324
What the fuck?

286
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,644
Come on go!

287
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,686
Oh, shit!

288
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,840
The Wolf Man Jack Show.

289
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,920
Well, I say all good things
got to come to an end...

290
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,880
and this is the end
of the line for us today.

291
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,040
And we sure have enjoyed having you's
all here with me and everything.

292
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,160
And I know y'all have enjoyed being had.

293
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,810
Come back next time, and remember...

294
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,809
the old Wolf Man loves y'all.
Bye, everybody.

295
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,280
I bid you welcome...

296
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,120
oh, nameless and numbered ones.

297
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,331
Tonight, we are going to play 31.

298
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,889
What is 31, pray tell?

299
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,000
Well, 31 is war.

300
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,320
And as the old saying goes...

301
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,722
war is hell.

302
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,800
In exactly 120 seconds, we will begin.

303
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,720
And all you have to do...

304
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,160
is survive 12 hours...

305
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,565
inside the walls
of our own private little hell.

306
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,840
And now...

307
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,160
for the survival odds, as we see fit.

308
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,280
Number one, 50 to 1.

309
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,728
Number two, 500 to 1.

310
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,360
Number three, 100 to 1.

311
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,480
Number four, 60 to 1.

312
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,720
Number five, 500 to 1.

313
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,000
Now, what do you have to do to survive?

314
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,000
Fear not.

315
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,520
We have some very
colorful heads for you tonight.

316
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,040
And they're here for one reason...

317
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,124
and for one reason only.

318
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,880
To kill you in the most
violent way possible.

319
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,200
Feast your eyes and behold.

320
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,363
Sick-Head.

321
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,364
Happy Halloween, motherfuckers.

322
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,360
Number five.

323
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,886
Blond whore. I'm going to bang you hard.

324
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,802
Number four. Worthless tramp.

325
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,164
Number three. Retarded gringo.

326
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,044
Stupid.

327
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,880
Number two.

328
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,880
Tired little bitch.

329
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,120
Number one.

330
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,406
Filthy scum.

331
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,564
A competition will be nice.

332
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,480
Now, do not be fooled...

333
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,120
by the man-beast I put before you.

334
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,886
This is a true world-class warrior.

335
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,769
He lives to kill.

336
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,767
Sick-Head will not go gentle
into this good night.

337
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,920
No, I won't.

338
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,608
Thirty-one has begun!

339
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,960
Welcome to 31.

340
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,760
You now have exactly 12 hours to play.

341
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,410
Happy Halloween.

342
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,924
Fucker.

343
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,200
Jesus, man.

344
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,169
- You almost goddamn it...
- No shit.

345
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,491
- See anybody else?
- Negative.

346
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,761
The average human is quite resilient.

347
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,280
Events that disgust us one minute...

348
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,410
quickly become infinitely
acceptable the next.

349
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,640
Sometimes, the weak ones
have the most fight...

350
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,120
or perhaps they're just
the luckiest, I don't know.

351
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,960
But as we like to say around here...

352
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,887
the dirtier you work, the luckier you get.

353
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,760
Sounds like it's coming from this room.

354
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,440
- It could be a trap.
- This whole goddamn business is a trap.

355
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,640
Okay, okay, I'm going to slide the door.

356
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,290
Get ready with the pipe.

357
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,481
Pull it off.

358
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,761
I thought it was Charly.

359
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,004
I've never been
so fucking happy I was wrong.

360
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,962
Fuck.

361
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,041
What is this fucking place?

362
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,843
Number four.

363
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,286
Are you afraid?

364
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,169
Are you looking for me?

365
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Here I am.

366
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,044
Open the fucking gate.

367
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,729
I'm going to put this fucking knife
so far up your fucking ass.

368
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
I might like that.

369
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,569
You're a fucking Chihuahua.

370
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,844
You think it's funny?

371
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,724
You are funny.

372
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,560
Open the fucking gate.

373
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,760
Fuck you.

374
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,360
I'm coming for you, boy.

375
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,400
Number four always dies first.

376
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,880
We're going to get so friendly...

377
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,760
it's going to kill you.

378
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,720
I'm fucking coming for you.

379
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,880
We'll see, fagot.

380
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,600
Open the fucking gate.

381
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,047
"Open the fucking gate."

382
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,080
I'm coming for you.

383
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,400
- "I'm coming for you."
- I'm fucking coming for you.

384
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,529
"I'm fucking coming for you."

385
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,320
Trick or treat, you are dead...

386
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,640
I will smash your fucking head.

387
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,520
Trick or treat, you are dead...

388
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,560
I will smash your fucking head.

389
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,240
Trick or treat, you are dead...

390
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,611
I will smash your fucking head.

391
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,560
Trick or treat, you are dead...

392
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,884
I will smash your fucking head!

393
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

394
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

395
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,280
Girl! Cool it with the bat.

396
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,089
I'm on your side.

397
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on now, child,
let's get the fuck out of here.

398
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,840
- Fuck.
- Goddamn bitch.

399
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,285
You something with that slugger.

400
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,000
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

401
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,920
Son of a bitch, I think I broke his neck.

402
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,600
Shit, where did he get me?

403
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,960
- I think in the shoulder blade.
- Fuck!

404
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I got to stop the bleeding.
Here, put some pressure here.
God!
Fuck that...

405
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,724
Hello, whore. Hello, bitch.

406
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,040
- Come one.
- Get away from me!

407
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,040
Get away from me. Come on.

408
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,520
- Come on. Get away.
- I'll stick it right up your ass.

409
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,840
Come on.

410
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,200
You want to play with me, bitch?

411
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,090
- Come here.
- Yes, I'm going.

412
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,720
- You're crazy.
- Do you want it?

413
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,404
I like it that way.

414
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,682
Who is the bitch now, huh?

415
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,880
You want?

416
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,920
- You want to play with me?
- Yes.

417
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,840
You're crazy, bitch.

418
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,400
I'm out of my mind.

419
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,200
Run, bitch. Run.

420
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,520
Run. Run.

421
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,046
Run. Run, run, run.

422
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,641
You better run, number five.

423
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,520
'Cause I'm gonna go kill number four...

424
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,400
and then I'm gonna come back for you...

425
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,400
and I'm gonna kill you nice and slow.

426
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,080
Okay? Run and hide.

427
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,440
- Go hide.
- Fuck!

428
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,726
Go hide.

429
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,880
Damn.

430
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,240
Ten hours and forty-three minutes.

431
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,846
Anything can still happen.

432
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,602
Hello, fagot.

433
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,040
How are you?

434
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,960
You thought I left. No, you owe me money.

435
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,203
Don't you remember, dickhead?
Don't you remember?

436
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,200
How do you want to die, huh?

437
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,486
How do you want to die?

438
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,681
Does that hurt, huh?

439
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,044
Are you okay?

440
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,440
I thought you were my brother.

441
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,920
- Fuck you, boy.
- Fuck you.

442
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,640
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

443
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,880
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

444
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,246
Fuck...

445
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,600
You ready to die?

446
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,364
Just fucking do it.

447
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,087
Just fucking do it!

448
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,602
Where are you?

449
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,320
The wolf is here.

450
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,846
Where are you, little bitch?

451
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,680
Where are you?

452
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,280
You want to play with the devil.

453
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,960
The wolf is here.

454
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,884
Where are you, huh?

455
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,521
Number five.

456
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,960
Hold up, do you hear that?

457
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,201
Charly.

458
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,166
Get away!

459
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,760
Strike two. Give me the bat.

460
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,560
Give me the bat.

461
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,240
Today you're going to die
for being stupid.

462
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,243
Come here.

463
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,648
I'm going to give you a hard one.

464
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

465
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,725
You've got it, bitch.

466
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,811
Again.

467
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,485
Again.

468
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,410
Let go of me.

469
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,888
My fucking bat!

470
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,680
I got you, brother. I got you.

471
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,127
I can't believe this is happening.

472
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,360
It's all right. I got you.

473
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,920
I'm too young. Too pretty.

474
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,120
I know, baby. I know.

475
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,160
- Hey, Panda.
- Yeah, baby.

476
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,440
Your momma...

477
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,080
- She...
- No.

478
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,880
She said she was my momma, too.

479
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,520
That I was her son from another mother.

480
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,968
- She say...
- You the brother, like no other, yes.

481
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,960
I... I feel...

482
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,840
I feel tired.

483
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,163
Really, really tired.

484
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,604
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

485
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,085
I do believe the first kill
came rather quickly this year.

486
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,560
I'm rather disappointed.

487
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,200
The first one always does.

488
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,520
It's the second one,
the second one has all the drama.

489
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,809
Well, I certainly hope
we see a better showing

490
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,440
from the remaining remnants.

491
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,889
We shall see, we shall see.

492
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,840
As we slip into our third hour
of non-stop 31 action...

493
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,925
come and enjoy some exquisite dining.

494
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,640
You may want to try
the steak kidney pie...

495
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,291
followed by the apple crumble.

496
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,640
Delicious.

497
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,960
For one of you...

498
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,204
this, of course,
might be your last supper.

499
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,240
Those twisted fuckers.

500
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,520
Fuck.

501
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,960
This is impressive.

502
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,120
I hate to admit, but this layout...

503
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,171
oh, man, it looks better
than me mother's New Year's brunch.

504
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,170
Yeah, and I assume
it's all laced with rat poisoning.

505
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,760
No, I'm relatively sure it's safe.

506
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,002
Seriously?

507
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,920
What could possibly make you say that?

508
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,765
Because we're playing their game.

509
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,000
Fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it.

510
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,731
My stomach's so empty,
it's touching me back.

511
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,365
Yeah, man.

512
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,360
Are you enjoying that?

513
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,167
Yeah, man.

514
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,760
I feel it.

515
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,400
I feel all of y'all looking at me.

516
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,130
You're judging. Don't.

517
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,683
I ain't made of stone.

518
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,120
Look, man. What happened to me, man...

519
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,200
Levon back there, man,
it's fucking horrible.

520
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,960
I mean, man, he was my best-est friend
in the whole goddamn world...

521
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,360
before any of you mothers
come in the picture!

522
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,720
Your best-est friend's blood
is all over my hands.

523
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:35,280
And that's why I and I gonna stay alive.

524
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,760
I don't do it on an empty stomach.

525
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,241
So you, you and you...

526
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,489
I suggest y'all do the same thing.

527
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,691
Fuck it.

528
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,840
I take it they're out watching us, right?

529
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,720
You bet your sweet skunk ass
they're watching.

530
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,320
And listening.

531
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,880
So keep your breathy thoughts to yourself.

532
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,930
You know, we can do this.
We just have to stay together.

533
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,531
Charly.

534
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,170
Charly.

535
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,163
What?

536
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:23,760
What is going on inside your head?

537
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,480
You want to know what's going on
inside my head?

538
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,880
I'll fucking tell you what's going on
inside my head.

539
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,600
We need better weapons than this shit.

540
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,081
You're goddamn right, girly.

541
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:44,040
Hey, anybody remember that story
last year, Halloween...

542
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,920
that church group that went missing?

543
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,520
Yeah, I remember hearing
something about that.

544
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,400
Just recently on the TV they found
the body of the pastor...

545
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,209
- In the dumpster.
- ...rotting in dumpster.

546
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,680
Holy shit. That's gonna be us.

547
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,920
- Come on.
- No, two-second news story.

548
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,120
You know, and we're forgotten.

549
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,931
- All right, all right, all right.
- Not by me.

550
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,360
Stop eating.

551
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,329
Why, why, what wrong?

552
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,521
Spit it out.

553
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,920
Let's get the fuck out of here.

554
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,080
What the fuck?

555
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,440
I sincerely hope you all enjoyed...

556
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,320
your protein-enriched nourishments.

557
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,040
The first re-assessment
of the standings are as follows.

558
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,480
Number one, 50 to 1 odds.

559
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,280
Number three at 90 to 1.

560
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,931
Number two at 300 to 1.

561
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,649
And last but not least
is number five, 400 to 1.

562
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,680
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, children of all ages...

563
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,000
with exactly nine hours left to play...

564
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,200
I give you Psycho-Head and his brother...

565
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,887
the maniacally mental Schizo-Head.

566
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,601
- There's two of them.
- Don't scatter.

567
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,440
Oh, goddamn.

568
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,440
We ain't got a fucking thing
to worry about this year, brother.

569
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,880
Look at these sorry sacks
of wasted meat shit.

570
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,009
Do we have your attention now,
mother fuckers?

571
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,640
You smell that?

572
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,480
Well, I think they're already
pissing in their pants.

573
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,723
Yeah. Now, you think you got one over...

574
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,920
because you took out
that little shot glass bitch Sick-Head.

575
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,604
Well, he isn't worth a shit.

576
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,485
The only thing he's good for
is shooting out of a fucking cannon.

577
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,160
And I don't see a fucking cannon.
Do you see a fucking cannon?

578
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,401
No cannon.

579
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,640
So that means you killed half a man.

580
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,000
And it took five of you...

581
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,360
to kill a little itty bitty baby.

582
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,360
Shit.

583
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,480
Hello, ladies.

584
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,880
I am all man, and I am coming for you.

585
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,122
We're gonna fuck all your holes.

586
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,240
Count yourselves lucky.

587
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,368
You got fucked by the best.

588
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,570
Eight hours and twelve minutes.

589
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,207
The fun is just beginning.

590
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,720
I don't hear them anymore.

591
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,960
- Me neither.
- Listen.

592
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,960
I think we should find a room.

593
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,160
Barricade ourselves in. Wait it out.

594
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,400
I second the barricade idea.

595
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,680
I'm sick of this hide-and-seek horse shit.

596
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,600
Got to use your head.

597
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,680
They don't want for us to be sitting
around all night on our back side.

598
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,240
Okay, hold on. Charly, we haven't
heard you in the last half an hour.

599
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,244
What do you say, huh?
Your vote counts like mine.

600
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,205
I say we hunt these freaks down
and slit their fucking throats.

601
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,526
All right.

602
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,560
Gonna fuck your pussy hole.

603
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,600
We're gonna fuck
that tiny little brown hole.

604
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,440
And we're gonna fuck your eye hole, too.

605
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,600
A cock in each motherfucking socket.

606
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,480
We're gonna fuck your mouth hole.

607
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,688
We're gonna fuck your pussy hole.

608
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,720
We're gonna fuck that tiny
little brown hole.

609
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,326
And we're gonna fuck your eye hole, too.

610
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,441
What's that sound?

611
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,886
Do you hear it?

612
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,206
It's coming from the fuck doll.

613
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

614
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,565
That's no fucking doll.

615
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,080
Jesus Christ, oh, God!

616
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,920
- Panda. Panda.
- What the fuck?

617
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,810
Don't flip out on me now, man. Come on.

618
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,360
Help me, please.

619
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,960
I need to go home.
Everyone is waiting for me.

620
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,041
Sweet Jesus.

621
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,280
Help me untie her.

622
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

623
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,640
What's your name, honey?

624
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,480
- Georgina Victor.
- Georgina.

625
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,560
But my husband calls me little Georgie.

626
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,800
Hold the fuck up, hold the fuck up.

627
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,720
- Put me the fuck down.
- Panda, what do you think?

628
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,120
We don't take the chance
and let her run loose.

629
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,362
She ain't one of them.

630
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,440
Look at her. Look at her.

631
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,400
She might be somebody's
daughter for all I know.

632
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,800
This is getting crazy around here.

633
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,640
Shut the fuck up.

634
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,440
Panda, shut the fuck up.

635
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,560
He's right, this is not a good idea.

636
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,689
Please, please, I know a way out.

637
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,680
- I've heard them talking.
- I believe you.

638
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,603
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

639
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,920
Shit, they fucking found us.

640
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,160
We got to secure the door.

641
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,640
I knew it. I fucking knew it.

642
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,200
She sounded the alarm.
She sounded the fucking alarm.

643
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,680
You psycho fucking bitch.

644
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,320
Yeah, I know you.
Tallahassee, Moline. I know you.

645
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,560
Shut the fuck up, Roscoe.

646
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,608
You don't listen to me.
You do not listen to me.

647
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,200
Look at her. Look at her.

648
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,360
Fucking asshole.

649
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,440
You are falling for her.

650
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,880
We've got to get something
to block off the door.

651
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,800
How about one of these pipes?

652
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,200
Look at me, look at me.

653
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,960
Are you fucking going to help me or not?

654
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,929
Look at me.

655
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,846
Fuck.

656
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,766
Fuck!

657
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,727
Bless you. Bless you.

658
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,200
I can't get the wires.

659
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,009
- It's in her fucking skin.
- Rip it out.

660
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,320
Think it'll hold?

661
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,447
No.

662
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,401
Get me out of here!

663
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,450
Fuck!

664
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,080
I knew it. I knew it.

665
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,560
You fucking bitch.

666
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,680
It's a fucking cage.

667
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,081
Goddamn it. It's a fucking cage.

668
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,884
Check the back.

669
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,200
Goddamn it. I knew it.

670
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,921
I knew it. Goddamn it.
Nobody listens to me.

671
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,002
Hi, there, Momma. You miss me?

672
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,800
Georgie!

673
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,160
Look what the fucking cat drug in.

674
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,440
Two blind mice.

675
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,680
See how they're dumb.

676
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,003
Even the fucking mice know how
to get out of the maze, motherfuckers.

677
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,480
Looks like I need a new fuck bag.

678
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,484
And after I get done
with pork chop, you're it.

679
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,920
Venus, get behind me.

680
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,320
You got to go through me for her.

681
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,368
You're gonna be my fuck bag.
Come on, bring it.

682
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,200
All that chivalry
is worthless, motherfucker.

683
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,480
Like tits on a boar hog.

684
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:31,281
- Come on, bitch.
- Meet Mr. Fucking Dick Head, sideburns.

685
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,765
Panda!

686
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,606
You fucking bitch.

687
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,331
You do like to make it happen,
don't you, bitch?

688
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,561
No, I'll never fucking die!

689
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,280
I don't want to die.

690
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,569
I don't want to be here.
They make me be here.

691
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,840
We're all pawns in this stupid game.

692
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,604
We don't want to do it.

693
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,840
You and me, we're the same.

694
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,604
We're the same, brother.

695
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,207
Okay, brother.

696
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,125
That thing's gonna come in handy.

697
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,567
Fuck.

698
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,600
All right, Roscoe, I got you, I got you.

699
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,160
Let's get out of here
before that damn thing slams shut again.

700
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,084
Charly, pick up that other chainsaw.

701
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,488
- Fucking chain snapped.
- Leave it.

702
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,480
Fuck.

703
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,609
Seven hours and three minutes.

704
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,760
I believe it's time
to recalculate the odds.

705
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,640
Prepare to open your purses.

706
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,164
Shit.

707
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,520
How fucked am I?

708
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,200
I don't know, man. It looks pretty bad.

709
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,360
Yeah, it feels pretty bad.

710
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,520
You've got to get this
tight enough to keep it shut.

711
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,480
What's that thing you say to the kids
coming out of the spook house in tears?

712
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,200
- Why?
- Just tell me.

713
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:20,650
Crying is for pussies,
so go grow a pair, you big baby.

714
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,001
Get ready to grow a pair, you big baby.

715
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,161
God.

716
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,047
That wasn't so bad, huh?

717
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,960
Attention, attention.

718
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,120
Number one, odds 40 to 1.

719
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,760
Number two, odds 300 to 1.

720
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:46,731
Number three, one million to one.

721
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,760
Fuck.

722
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:53,720
Five, odds 300 to one.

723
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,567
Sex and Death are on their way.

724
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,440
What the fuck is going on?

725
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,720
You see anything?

726
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,640
All I see is a bunch of nothing.

727
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,560
It seems crazy.

728
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,800
Waiting here to be attacked.

729
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,800
Running around with our heads cut off.

730
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,882
Want to give us a chance
to get our heads cut off.

731
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,165
Get the others.

732
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:24,083
Come with me. Shit's going down.

733
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,480
- Come on. Stay here.
- What are you talking about?

734
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,686
Be right back.

735
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,920
Ain't no way I going toe
to toe with that guy.

736
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,920
All right, my best play
is I circle around...

737
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,162
coldcock him from the back side.

738
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,520
Now, once I'm in place...

739
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,240
y'all create a distraction.

740
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,210
Only gonna get one shot.
So you got to make it proper.

741
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,442
Death has come to sing its quiet song.

742
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,960
How they hide, for it won't be long.

743
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:08,284
Death strikes once, and then it's gone.

744
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,963
Where are you, you little fucking cunts?

745
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,803
I want to see you.

746
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,761
Fuck if I'm going to fucking stay here.

747
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,121
Goddammit.

748
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,240
- Come on.
- We're right here.

749
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,845
Come on, come and get it.

750
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,250
Baby, behind you.

751
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,360
How nice.
The women are here to save the day.

752
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,120
- Come on.
- Come, ladies, come here.

753
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,600
- Panda, Panda.
- Come, come on.

754
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,841
I want to fuck you!

755
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,367
I'm so scared.

756
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,650
Hi.

757
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,440
Great white hunter.

758
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,204
What am I going to do with you?

759
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,250
Would you like a lick of my lolly?

760
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,360
I remember you.

761
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,126
I'm so flattered you remember me.

762
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,809
Is it hunting time now?

763
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,165
Or how about now?

764
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,680
Don't worry, Popeye.

765
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,360
It's always someone's fault.

766
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,840
Come here, bitch. Come and get me.

767
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,403
Well, I am kind of high
from eating all my spinach.

768
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:50,602
I guess maybe I should really
put you out of your misery.

769
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,451
Fuck!

770
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,406
Bitch.

771
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,600
Fuck you.

772
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,011
Motherfucker, come on.

773
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,091
I can feel your fear.

774
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,280
It's like a strange smell.

775
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,089
- Hey!
- Scat!

776
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,480
You want her?

777
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:46,200
Then back off, or I'll slit
her fucking throat.

778
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:49,120
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.

779
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,040
Don't hurt her.

780
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,043
Don't do that. Don't do that.

781
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,327
You can kill me.

782
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,689
Venus.

783
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,491
Baby, no!

784
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,605
No!

785
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,000
Baby. No!

786
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,200
What are you waiting for?

787
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,360
We can't.

788
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,520
Do it. Do it.

789
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,680
No! No! No!

790
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,680
No!

791
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,286
What do you want to do with her, Charly?

792
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,760
What is the next step?

793
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:04,240
We must calculate
the next step very carefully.

794
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,480
Death-Head was our safety net.

795
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,880
But since he has expired...

796
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,080
Could I suggest Bash-Head?

797
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,920
He can't be trusted
to close the deal properly, no.

798
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,400
Fuck you, bitch.

799
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:21,200
- Maybe Rage-Head.
- Too irrational.

800
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,360
Fuck.

801
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:27,400
I believe there is only one logical...

802
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,640
and still compelling choice.

803
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,640
Oh, yeah.

804
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:34,080
Doom-Head.

805
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,600
Fuck, fuck. Bitch.

806
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,920
Are we in agreement on that decision?

807
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,760
Agreed.

808
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,600
Fucking yeah.

809
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,400
It is Doom-Head.

810
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,280
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

811
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,760
Who's going to make the call?

812
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,922
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

813
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,690
Oh, yeah.

814
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,160
- Fuck.
- Don't answer that phone.

815
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,520
Don't answer it.

816
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,120
It can wait, don't answer it.

817
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,851
Fuck, you don't stop now.

818
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,329
This is business.

819
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,525
Yeah?

820
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:17,120
Thing is, I really wasn't planning
on working this year.

821
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:21,205
Right now, I got
a pretty decent piece of pussy...

822
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,642
with a big 'ol ass
spread right in front of me.

823
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,089
Double last year's fee.

824
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:33,520
Done. I'll be there in 90 minutes.

825
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,080
Who was that?

826
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,400
Fuck off.

827
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,686
Who was it, baby?

828
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,920
That, believe it or not...

829
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,480
was Mr. None Of-Your-Fucking-Business.

830
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,320
Yeah, well, what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

831
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:58,080
Well, you can stick your fingers
in your dripping twat...

832
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,960
and finish yourself off,
or get the fuck out.

833
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,400
Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.

834
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,240
You know, you're pretty full of yourself.

835
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,840
Nobody messes with Mr. Big Shot.
Well, fuck you.

836
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:15,440
Bitch, when you run
a perfect game day after day...

837
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,800
ain't luck, hon. Skill.

838
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,000
Can I at least take a shower before I go?

839
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,440
Negative.

840
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,127
Take that sticking ass and hit the bricks.

841
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,561
Do you hear that?

842
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,323
God, I love that song.

843
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:17,405
Shit. I wish I was in California.

844
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,480
What am I working with?

845
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,200
Four hours and thirty-seven minutes.

846
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:57,523
I can kill your whole family
in that amount of time.

847
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:18,160
I'm not crazy, I'm in control.

848
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,200
I'm not crazy, I'm in control.

849
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:25,040
I'm not crazy, I'm in control!

850
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,963
I'm not. Fuck!

851
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,290
Fuck!

852
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,963
Fuck!

853
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,009
Gentlemen.

854
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,280
Take the rest of the night off.

855
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,840
I'll handle it from here.

856
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,000
Murder school...

857
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,447
well, it's now in session.

858
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

859
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,440
Hey, bitch.

860
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,400
Did you really think cutting
my head off was going to keep me down?

861
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:44,042
I got that motherfucker sewn back
on pronto, and I am feeling groovy.

862
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:49,480
See, we ain't human around here.
No, no, no.

863
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,000
Ain't you learned shit, yet?

864
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,840
Hey, brother, looky over here.

865
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,161
You want to see something mad funny?

866
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,800
Hey, there number five.

867
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,360
Welcome to the party.

868
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,320
Here's your first question.

869
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,563
What's sicker than fucking
a pregnant bitch?

870
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,640
Gee, I don't know.

871
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,644
What is sicker than fucking
a pregnant bitch?

872
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:22,562
Getting a blowjob from the baby.

873
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:28,240
- Do another one, man.
- All right, all right.

874
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,200
Next one, number five.

875
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:35,730
What is the difference
between an onion and a whore?

876
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,720
Oh, shucks, I don't know.

877
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:44,044
Though I should, 'cause I am a whore.
What is it?

878
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,240
Wait, wait, wait, I know this one.

879
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,400
Let me do it, let me do it.

880
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,845
All right, brother, you go ahead.

881
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:55,480
The difference between an onion
and a whore is...

882
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,767
I cry when I cut onions.

883
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,760
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

884
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,047
It's okay.

885
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,121
It's okay.

886
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,964
It's all right.

887
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,403
Roscoe.

888
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,080
I had the worst nightmare.

889
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:36,882
How can a nightmare
be any worse than this reality?

890
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,045
It can't.

891
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,200
How long was I asleep?

892
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,600
I don't know.

893
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:52,800
At this point I don't know...

894
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,201
if it's a minute or an hour.

895
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,400
Where's Charly?

896
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,480
Hey, did...

897
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,880
Where's Charly?

898
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,122
She went down the hall
to see what she could find.

899
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,640
You let her go out on her own?

900
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,609
Like I was going to stop her?

901
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,880
You idiot. An idiot.

902
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,320
She specifically said
for you to stay here.

903
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,000
Well, that's not going to happen.

904
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,764
Come on, Venus.

905
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,882
Give me a fucking break.

906
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,404
Excuse me for asking, father...

907
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:41,080
but what exactly is the protocol
if we have a survivor?

908
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,960
Doom-Head has never failed us.

909
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,000
He will deliver, as expected.

910
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:50,051
I mean no disrespect,
but that was not the question.

911
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,360
I suggest you make sure
your final wagers are in order.

912
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,320
Lovely. Thank you, darling, thank you.

913
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,080
Lovely, lovely, lovely.

914
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,920
Right, my wager.

915
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,401
Five million.

916
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,320
I respectfully decline. I am out.

917
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,040
Of course you are.

918
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,442
Playing with the big boys
isn't everyone's cup of tea.

919
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,527
I will take that bet.

920
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,887
And double it.

921
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,080
Charly?

922
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,360
All right, now we have ourselves a game.

923
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,171
So, let us continue.

924
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,886
Charly?

925
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,610
You smell that?

926
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,960
Odd smell.

927
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:54,440
I didn't yank my crusty old dong
out of some whore's asshole...

928
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:57,440
for a quickie wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

929
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,888
I came to get down and dirty.

930
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,128
Oh, yeah.

931
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,685
Please...

932
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,160
let them live.

933
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,840
What is it about me that gives you...

934
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,730
some impression that I would spare them?

935
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:17,680
'Cause if that's the case...

936
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,003
then I really got to work
on my person to person demeanor.

937
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,840
Unfortunately...

938
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,960
those other fools and idiots gave you
the most worthless feeling.

939
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,480
And that feeling is hope.

940
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,760
The unicorn alive
shitting the magic rainbow...

941
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,480
it's but an illusion.

942
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:43,280
Life is nothing
but the stinking filthy boneyard...

943
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,727
of dead rotting tramps.

944
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,044
Did you see Venus?

945
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,360
What are you talking about, man?
I left her here with you.

946
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,886
Fuck me.

947
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,280
Attention, attention.

948
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,489
Three hours and four minutes.

949
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,887
How time flies.

950
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,240
Victorious warriors win first,
then go to war.

951
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:33,288
While defeated warriors...

952
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:37,480
they go to war first then seek to win.

953
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,244
Which are you?

954
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,569
I'm a gentleman of war.

955
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,240
So I'll give you a moment
of peace and tranquility...

956
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,845
with your fallen comrade.

957
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,200
By the way...

958
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:58,569
the doors to the outside world
are now officially open.

959
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,285
Feel free to wander the grounds.

960
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,724
Come on, let's go.

961
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,925
It's a fucking dead end.
A goddamn dead end.

962
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,601
Damn.

963
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:41,880
What's this?

964
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,564
This, this, this.

965
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:46,040
This is fucking it. This is fucking it.

966
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,441
Help me, help me. This is it.

967
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,086
- Come on.
- It's rising.

968
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,162
Come on. Help me.

969
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:07,560
What do you think?

970
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,720
It's your best chance.

971
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,520
You mean our best chance.

972
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,200
No, I don't. I can't get down there.

973
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,680
After everything,
this is where you bail on me?

974
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,920
No, this shit ain't over.

975
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,400
I can't get down there. I can't.

976
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,209
You can.

977
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:26,927
Fuck, he's coming. Get in there.

978
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,880
I'll hold him off as long as I can.

979
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,320
Wait, I'm not leaving.

980
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,560
Fucking go.

981
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,680
- I'm not leaving without you.
- Get the fuck down there.

982
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,400
- Get the fuck in there.
- Get in here with me.

983
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,600
Stupid bitch, get in there.
Shut the fuck up and get out of here.

984
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,808
Get the fuck in there.

985
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,327
At least I get to die in the fresh air.

986
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,490
Hey, fuck head!

987
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,764
Get over here!

988
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:01,562
Get the fuck over here, fuck head!

989
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,208
You trying to fight me or fuck me?

990
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,131
Fuck you.

991
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,770
Fuck.

992
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Number five.

993
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,046
Boo.

994
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:30,764
In moments of great
accomplishment such as this...

995
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,083
I feel the need to celebrate.

996
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,480
I found that the best of times...

997
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:41,121
happens exactly at the point
we lose track of them.

998
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:47,329
We must train ourselves to extend
the moment and learn to live.

999
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,040
Smoke in times of rest...

1000
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:07,727
is a great companion
to the solitary soldier.

1001
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:11,002
You know who said that?

1002
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:17,489
Do you know said that?

1003
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:37,968
Do you really think I give a fuck?

1004
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:48,080
It was everyone's favorite
revolutionary Marxist, Che Guevara.

1005
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:53,007
Except, I think he smoked a pipe.

1006
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:57,851
I always thought I'd appear
rather pretentious with a pipe.

1007
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:04,250
Look into the eyes of a true champion.

1008
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,362
Look.

1009
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:13,285
Look into the eyes of a true champion.

1010
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:18,401
Look into the eyes of a true champion.

1011
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:26,725
Look into the eyes of a true champion.

1012
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,082
That's a good girl.

1013
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:47,249
It's all okay.

1014
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,720
Catch your breath.

1015
01:32:55,800 --> 01:33:00,480
Catch your breath. It's okay.

1016
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,080
It's okay.

1017
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,160
There you go.

1018
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:07,322
Relax, little girl.

1019
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,200
Well, well, well...

1020
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,568
shall we do this white chapel style, then?

1021
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,371
Bloody red tears, my dear Mary Kelly.

1022
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,843
I have to say I do respect you.

1023
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:31,886
But...

1024
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,850
it's time to die.

1025
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:41,681
Weapons down. Weapons down.

1026
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,040
Motherfucker!

1027
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:48,760
Thirty-one has come to an end.

1028
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,367
You lucky fucking dirty little cunt.

1029
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:28,440
It seems the unthinkable has happened.

1030
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,440
We have a winner.

1031
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:34,800
What exactly will you do with her?

1032
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,960
I'm going to have to get back
to you on that one.

1033
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:44,206
Thank you for another exciting year of 31.
