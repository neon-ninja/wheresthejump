1
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,246
Little Ricky, where are you baby?
Come on, honey. It's dinner time.

2
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,474
It's your favorite flavor. Liver buffet.
Where are you?

3
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:53,190
There you are.
Hey, what're you doing under there?

4
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,946
What you doing under there?
What's the matter?

5
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Ricky, baby,
what's the matter sweetheart?

6
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,354
They're ready for you, Doctor.

7
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,970
- How is she?
- Still in the OR.

8
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,930
We haven't heard anything yet.

9
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,473
When did this happen?

10
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:46,186
He was waiting for her at her place
when she got home from class.

11
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,606
Forensics says it was the same man
who raped Cara Latham.

12
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,275
Did you really need a forensics expert
to tell you that?

13
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,402
- Andy.
- Dana, when was the last time

14
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,530
I asked your department to beef up
the security and cameras, right?

15
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,783
I mean not the first four times.
Just the last time.

16
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,785
Don't get pissy with me, Professor.

17
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,330
I don't have the manpower
to break up a frat party.

18
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,789
- Suction.
- Suction.

19
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,957
What's that pressure?

20
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:11,044
We're under 70. Sixty-nine.
She's sliding down pretty fast.

21
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,380
- We're gonna lose her, Doctor.
- I would not bet my ranch on that.

22
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,633
David, drop 0.2 CCs of epinephrine.

23
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,260
- Tanya, give me the stitch please.
- 3-0 silk.

24
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,361
We're down at 63. Epinephrine, Doctor?

25
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,196
No, not yet.

26
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,035
Sixty.

27
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,954
Still think it's a Phenobarb reaction?

28
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,001
Epinephrine.

29
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,948
In.

30
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,033
All right.
Ease up on that retraction pressure.

31
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,300
Sixty-five and going up.

32
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,594
Don't worry about that.

33
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,346
- 68.
- I don't believe it.

34
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,917
- 72.
- How about some scissors?

35
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,726
- Metzenbaum.
- Beautiful.

36
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,271
80. She's out of the woods.

37
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,219
- Way to practice medicine. Irrigation please.
- Irrigation.

38
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,304
Dr. Robertson,
would you please close for me?

39
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,280
- You got it.
- Nice going, people.

40
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,409
By the way, everybody,

41
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,913
it's great to be in Saint Agnes.

42
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,711
That was good work.

43
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,868
- Dr. Robertson... May I call you Matthew?
- Of course.

44
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,386
Matthew,

45
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:32,292
I'm the new guy around here
and I want to make friends,

46
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,560
so I'll say this to you
and we'll start fresh.

47
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,468
If you don't like my jokes, don't laugh.

48
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:47,598
If you have a medical opinion,
please speak up and speak up loud.

49
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:52,603
But if you ever again tell me or my surgical
staff that we're going to lose a patient,

50
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,456
I'm going to take out your lungs
with a fucking ice-cream scoop.

51
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,252
Do you understand me?

52
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,171
I'm not gonna like you, am I?

53
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,676
Don't be ridiculous. Everybody likes me.

54
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,255
- Dr. Hill.
- Yeah.

55
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,383
I'm Andy Safian.
I'm Associate Dean at the college

56
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,970
and I wondered if you could tell me
anything about Bridget Kelly's condition.

57
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,906
Well, she has a badly contused liver,
but I think she's gonna be just fine.

58
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,535
Great. Thanks to you.

59
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:38,039
Well, come to the midnight show,
I levitate the next of kin.

60
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,919
It's Jed Hill, right?

61
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,379
Yeah.

62
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,214
"Galloping" Jed Hill?

63
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,217
Excuse me.

64
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,052
We were at the high school together.

65
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,791
You're kidding me.

66
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,710
- You went to Van Buren?
- Yeah.

67
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,253
How long you've been in Westerly?

68
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,382
Well, I've been here about nine hours now.
Van Buren, huh?

69
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,677
Yeah, well, we weren't in the same...
We didn't travel in the same circles but...

70
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:11,072
- Did I give you a hard time?
- No, you didn't know who the hell I was.

71
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,742
Dr. Hill.

72
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,745
Hi, Tanya.

73
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:21,082
I just wanted to say congratulations.
We're all very happy that you're here.

74
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,836
Well, thank you. It's nice to be here.

75
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,801
Looks like you're big man
on campus again.

76
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,724
- I hope to see you around.
- Yeah, me, too.

77
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,733
That's wonderful, Michelle.

78
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,862
Hey, why don't we try painting
on the paper not on your arm?

79
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,742
- I am a boogeyman.
- Teacher, teacher!

80
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,772
Hey, Jason, don't you ever, ever play
with plastic bags

81
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,874
or I'll tie you up and I'll feed you
to little cape monster. You got it?

82
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,245
Hi. I heard what happened.

83
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,497
Can you go on lunch now?

84
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,265
Give me a minute.

85
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:28,050
Yeah, the guy got in
when she was out at her class.

86
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,219
- She's gonna be all right?
- Looks like it.

87
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,472
Turns out that your hospital
has a new surgeon,

88
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,058
this whiz kid from Mass General
who did a great job.

89
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:41,454
So I went back to introduce myself,
to thank him and are you ready for this?

90
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,874
- We went to high school together.
- Oh, no kidding.

91
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,281
- Speak of the devil...
- And the devil appears.

92
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,618
I was just recounting
all your exploits here.

93
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,886
This is my wife, Tracy.
Tracy, this is Dr. Jed Hill.

94
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,180
Any high school friend of Andy's...

95
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,376
- This is Dr. Sullivan, Alan and Tracy Safian.
- Andy.

96
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,129
Andy. Andy works at the college.

97
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,673
- He's associate dean of students.
- Fantastic.

98
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,259
I don't leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

99
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,803
- But we are very proud of him.
- That's well. You should be.

100
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,224
Listen, we're having a small reception
to welcome Jed to Saint Agnes.

101
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,558
Why don't you come along?

102
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,393
We'd love to,
but we have a lunch appointment.

103
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,187
Maybe some other time.

104
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,579
Definitely.

105
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,458
- Nice meeting you, Tracy.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

106
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,617
Well, we got the estimate
from the plumber this morning.

107
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,925
And?

108
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,580
- Are you ready for this?
- How much?

109
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,209
It's 13,000 and change.

110
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,586
How much change?

111
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,421
It's 14,000.

112
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,924
All right, forget it.
I'm gonna do the work myself.

113
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,717
- I got a better idea.
- No.

114
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,427
Well, just for a little while.
It'll pay some bills.

115
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,096
We rent it to
some visiting lecturer or something.

116
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:59,392
I don't want to rent out the third floor.
I don't want a stranger in our house.

117
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,852
All right, suit yourself.

118
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:05,815
Would've been nice living in a home
with running water but...

119
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,749
I'm a simple girl.

120
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,364
- Hey, I'm gonna pick you up after work.
- No, it's okay.

121
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,576
Forget it. I'm gonna pick you up.
There's a maniac loose in this town.

122
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,244
Helen can give me a ride.

123
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,762
- She can? Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yes.

124
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,060
Make sure she waits
until you're inside the house.

125
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,605
I'll have her provide air coverage
if you want.

126
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,779
It's funny. I married a funny woman.

127
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,306
- See you.
- Goodnight. See you.

128
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,190
You know in street clothes,
Helen looks positively masculine.

129
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,566
What?

130
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,335
Helen. You said you were
getting a ride home from Helen.

131
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:39,174
- Were you spying on me?
- No, no. I was just looking out my window.

132
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,661
Then you were looking
at Dennis Riley, Andy.

133
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,012
He was my mother's lawyer.
He had papers for me to sign.

134
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,723
What kind of papers?

135
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,169
Something about my mother's estate.
What is this?

136
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,213
- Your mother's estate?
- Yes.

137
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,216
You told me she barely got by
on a social security check.

138
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,927
And now she's Lady Astor?

139
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,360
Come on, Andy.

140
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,265
There was a small account.
It handled the cemetery arrangements.

141
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,351
The money's run out.
Dennis wanted to talk to me about.

142
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,036
Now what is it you want
to talk to me about?

143
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,205
Sorry.

144
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,213
Hey, listen, would you think
any less of me if I used a fork?

145
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,950
I'm beginning to lose my strength here.

146
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,051
I can't let that happen.

147
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,220
Lie back. Give it to me.

148
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,850
Lie back. That's right.
All the way back.

149
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,895
- Technique, huh?
- The expert.

150
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:39,734
It's all in my hands, see?
Open. Open up.

151
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,238
Good boy. Delicious, huh?

152
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,950
Open.

153
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,066
That's good. More.

154
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,584
Look, I think your strength
is returning.

155
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,213
It's a miracle.

156
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:25,947
Andy.

157
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,493
- What?
- He's there again.

158
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,037
So?

159
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,775
He's looking at us.

160
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,237
Sounds like he's playing
one of those electric keyboards.

161
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,782
Jesus, it gives me the creeps.

162
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,509
Be nice. His mother works at night.
I think she's a night nurse.

163
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,846
He's probably lonely.

164
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,608
We gotta get some curtains up in here.
It's a priority.

165
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,305
Curtains are now the priority.

166
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,990
Not until we decide what to paint.

167
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:14,913
There is no point in painting if we are
gonna rip up the floors with the plumbing.

168
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:20,168
So, really, we're back
to where we started.

169
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,240
Jeez.

170
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,910
Front door was wide open.

171
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,288
You scared the hell out of me.

172
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,208
- I should have knocked but...
- Oh, no, no.

173
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,612
Yeah. I have been working
with all this paint remover.

174
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,323
Sometimes I get a headache
from all the fumes.

175
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,201
- You should be taking a B complex.
- Say again?

176
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:13,096
Well, a loading dose of a B-12
would help to enhance the cerebral...

177
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,708
- Never mind.
- No, no, no.

178
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,209
Why did you stop? That sounded great.

179
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,752
Well, no, it just occurred to me
that I was suggesting

180
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:19,962
you take a jar of vitamins,

181
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,922
when the smart thing to do
would be to leave the door open.

182
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,884
Look at that. I saved myself $5.95.

183
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,468
I was in the neighborhood
looking at some houses

184
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,237
and I thought I would take you and
your wife up on that rain check for lunch.

185
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,683
Great. Well, Tracy is out at her class

186
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,686
but I can get cleaned up
and we could go out ourselves.

187
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,621
- Sounds good.
- All right. Okay, I'll be right back.

188
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,840
So this is a real Victorian, huh?

189
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,328
Yeah, buried under
a hundred years of paint.

190
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,471
It was part of the underground railroad
during the civil war.

191
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,935
What it lacks in comfort,
it makes up for in history.

192
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,672
You know anything about architecture?

193
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,842
Architecture? Architecture is my life.

194
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,429
If I hadn't been a doctor,
I'd have been a...

195
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,307
I'd have been a building.
Is this a Degas?

196
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,201
Yeah. I think it's original.
Tracy's father gave it to her.

197
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,461
She's been having these abdominal pains.

198
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,908
- How often?
- Maybe once every couple of days.

199
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,117
How long do they last?

200
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,953
Maybe half a minute,
sometimes a little longer.

201
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,245
Is she seeing someone?

202
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,973
Yeah, a doctor in Boston
named Lillianfield.

203
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,877
David Lillianfield. Do you know him?

204
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,771
I've heard of him.
Lillianfield is a good man.

205
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:51,903
The thing is, we really wanna have kids.
Tracy is nuts about it. So am I.

206
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,405
I'll tell you what.

207
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:00,604
Give it another couple of weeks and if there
is no change, have her come by and see me.

208
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,997
- All right.
- Hey, Stanley.

209
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,000
Hey, Doc, it hurts when I do this.

210
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,837
Then don't do that.
And get some new jokes, Stanley.

211
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:15,035
So I told him,
"Why don't you come by and look at ours,

212
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,178
"and maybe it would work out?"

213
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,013
You did what?

214
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,850
You're the one who wanted to rent it out.
I thought you'd be thrilled.

215
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,560
Do I look thrilled?

216
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,841
You're not thrilled. I can see that now,

217
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,511
but this is better than a visiting lecturer.
Jed is a friend.

218
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,098
He's not a friend.
He didn't even remember your name, Alan.

219
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,727
I mean, common the guy had
just been through 12 hours of surgery.

220
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,353
What is it, Andy?
You want to relive the high school,

221
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,897
be friends with the quarterback
this time?

222
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:48,736
No, he was the running back.
And stop talking to me like I'm 11.

223
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,781
What's your problem with this guy?
I mean he's smart, he's funny,

224
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,783
and he's a brilliant doctor.

225
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,744
I know. I know he's brilliant, Andy.

226
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,079
I can tell by the way
the nursing staff genuflect

227
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,581
when he walks down the hallway.

228
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,142
I mean, this guy doesn't have friends,
he has subjects.

229
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,397
Well, it's not too late,
we can call it off.

230
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,136
No, no. I'm leaving it up to you.

231
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,638
If you want to live with that,
it's your decision.

232
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,699
You're gonna get to like him.
You really will.

233
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,394
And you know what else?

234
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,371
We could even ask him
to recommend another doctor for you.

235
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,232
Hold on. What?

236
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,486
If for no other reason,
then it's ludicrous to drive two hours

237
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,988
to see Lillianfield in Boston
when we could just easily...

238
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,657
Andy, please tell me
you didn't say anything to Jed.

239
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,800
Please tell me you didn't share
my problems with him.

240
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,220
It came up.

241
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,431
It came up.

242
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,101
I apologize.

243
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,005
All right.

244
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,508
I will go along with this
for a few months

245
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,819
only because I have my heart set on a sofa
to go with the step ladder.

246
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,685
Oh, my God, is he moving in tonight?

247
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:07,147
- You're assuming it's Jed?
- I'm quite certain it's Jed. Open the door.

248
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,414
It could be anyone.

249
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,627
Angels could dance on pinheads, Andy,
but they don't. It's Jed.

250
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,757
- What makes you so sure?
- You want to bet me?

251
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,828
No.

252
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,971
Because once money is involved,
you take me seriously, right?

253
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,042
Hello.

254
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,253
Dr. Hill. Please come in.

255
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,645
Hey, Jed.

256
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,550
Andy just got through telling me
we're gonna be roommates.

257
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,801
Well, that's why I stopped by.

258
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,220
I just wanted to make sure
that it was really okay.

259
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,639
Yeah. Don't be silly.
I'm looking forward to it.

260
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,891
She is. She is really
looking forward to it.

261
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,325
Excellent.

262
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,506
The mid-term was at 8:30.

263
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,785
I set my alarm for 7:00
and it didn't go off.

264
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:05,539
I mean, if Professor Schmidt wants to give
me an incomplete, then I really don't care.

265
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,767
I can't control everything in this world.
My alarm didn't go off.

266
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,422
That's good. That's very good, Paula.

267
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:17,566
That's so much better than locking
your copy of Beowulf in your friend's car.

268
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,111
Thank You.

269
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,514
Yeah.

270
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,434
- Detective Harris wishes to see you.
- Really.

271
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,561
I'm amazed she could find the building.

272
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,105
We'll have to continue this next week
if you don't mind.

273
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,372
Fine.

274
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,334
Hang on, Paula.

275
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,629
Hi, Dana, go on in.
I'll be just a second.

276
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,076
Mrs. Worthington, I want you to note
all test and exam times for Ms. Paula Bell.

277
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,787
She's to receive wake up calls
from this office.

278
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,247
Wake up calls?

279
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,959
She can't be expected to
control the world, Mrs. Worthington.

280
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,711
Her alarm didn't go off.

281
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,645
I'll see you next week, Paula.

282
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,484
- Sorry.
- Jesus.

283
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,932
Was she able to
give any kind of description?

284
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,809
All she remembers is
her cat crouching under a chair

285
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,077
and an arm grabbing her from behind.

286
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,066
Is there any chance
she'll remember more?

287
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,791
I don't think so.

288
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,444
So...

289
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,962
- What do we do now?
- We?

290
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,701
"We" don't do anything, Andy.
Only one of us is a police detective.

291
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,552
Maybe not even that many.

292
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,540
Collegiate wit. Let me search my mind
for a clever comeback.

293
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,433
How about "bite me"?

294
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,352
Touché.

295
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,855
We have ordered more
"Security Precautions" pamphlets.

296
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,801
- More pamphlets?
- That's right.

297
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,445
Do you know what I see
when I come to work every morning?

298
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,977
I see fathers loading steamer trunks,
suitcases, fichus plants

299
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,062
and daughters into station wagons.

300
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,189
Presumably to drive them off to school

301
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,192
so that they don't pose
quite as high a death threat.

302
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,945
See, I don't think I'm being
unreasonable when I ask

303
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,531
what you and your
crack-team of professionals are doing

304
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,758
other than distributing literature
to repress this situation.

305
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,329
I need a list of anyone who had access
to the students' schedules.

306
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,889
Both victims were out of class
when our guy got in.

307
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,337
So you have narrowed it down
to a couple of thousand people.

308
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,106
A list, Andy. I need it, now.

309
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,984
Dana.

310
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,571
- What do you think he does with the hair?
- The hair?

311
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,991
Yeah, he cuts off all their hair.
What do you think he does with it?

312
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,494
He makes pillows. Who knows?

313
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:42,503
Billy, I want you in bed by 10:00,
you hear me?

314
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,631
You scared the shit out of me.

315
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,966
I'm sorry about that.

316
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,067
What the hell are you doing in here?

317
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,933
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

318
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,825
Anybody home?

319
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,414
Up here, honey.

320
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,627
This is ridiculous.

321
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,170
Baby, go to sleep.

322
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,757
Who the hell can sleep
with them going at it all night?

323
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,801
It's been like three hours.

324
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,053
I'll ask him to turn it down.

325
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:33,515
No, I don't want to make
a big thing about it.

326
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,116
No, no, if you can't fall asleep...

327
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,708
- You think maybe he heard us?
- I hope so.

328
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,672
- Where're you going?
- To the bathroom.

329
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,683
I know why guys like you become doctors.

330
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,879
- It's not what you think.
- Yeah?

331
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:08,440
I think it's so you can make a lot of money
and see a lot of naked women.

332
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,986
Well, then it is what you think.

333
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,579
Hey, pace yourself.
I'm not done with you yet.

334
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,567
- I'm impervious to alcohol.
- Yeah?

335
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,793
We'll see about that.

336
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,137
Tracy.

337
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,021
You all right?

338
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,236
Yeah. I'll be right there.

339
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,499
- You had me worried for a second.
- No, I'm fine.

340
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,180
Come on, let's go to bed.

341
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,777
Hey, hey. Got to get out there, old man.

342
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,821
Six miles a day keeps the doctor away.

343
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,992
- You want some coffee?
- No, never touch in the morning.

344
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,995
- You okay, Trace?
- I'm fine.

345
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,415
Well, I'll grab quick shower,
fly over to the hospital.

346
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,182
I'll catch you guys later.

347
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,772
Are you sure she didn't call to
cancel her appointment?

348
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,457
Yes, I'm sure. In fact,
I called her yesterday to remind her.

349
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,654
- Did you try calling her again?
- Nobody's there, professor.

350
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:38,199
- I keep getting her answering machine.
- She's there.

351
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,675
She's dodging the call.

352
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,075
Paula?

353
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,925
Paula!

354
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,309
I'm gonna need a statement.

355
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,232
Andy.

356
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,616
You wanna hear about the first time
I ever saw a corpse?

357
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,896
No.

358
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,483
It was my first year of medical school,
gross anatomy.

359
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:20,069
The takes a real saw
to the cadavers head.

360
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,990
People were running out of the room.
They're passing out, turning green.

361
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,702
I tell you, it really didn't
bother me over that much, though.

362
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,037
It's a great story, Jed.

363
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:33,724
Of course, I'll never look at a cantaloupe
the same way again, but other than that...

364
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,186
Hey, You'll get over it.

365
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,724
Hey, Stanley, who the hell is that
in the backfield?

366
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,769
Livelle something. He's off the bench.

367
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,371
- What happened to Krakowski?
- Flunked the piss test.

368
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,834
That upsets me.

369
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,423
Guy can't stay off of cocaine
even for one million dollars.

370
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,079
Man, I'll give my right arm
for a million dollars.

371
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,139
We cannot afford plumbing,
for Christ's sake.

372
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,185
- Would you really?
- What?

373
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,313
Give your right arm
for one million dollars?

374
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,735
- You mean like, literally?
- Yeah.

375
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:32,199
Well, not even an arm.
Let's just say a finger.

376
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,995
One finger, for one million dollars?

377
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,734
Oh, God, this is a strange conversation.

378
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:45,071
What we're talking about
is a surgical procedure

379
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:48,090
just to the joint. Would you do it?

380
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,219
No.

381
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,555
Really?

382
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,975
Would you?

383
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,231
No.

384
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,429
Oh, man.

385
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,906
I should be getting back.
Here, let me...

386
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,476
No, no, no, no.

387
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,437
Hey, stay and have
one more drink with me.

388
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,621
No. Tracy's gonna be home.

389
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,207
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

390
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,383
Stanley.

391
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,763
Would you please bring those two girls
a round of whatever it is they're drinking?

392
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,558
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon it is.

393
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,657
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

394
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,786
This is the living room.

395
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,789
Have a seat.

396
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,029
I just need you to
clear up a few things for me.

397
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,463
Like what?

398
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,160
Paula Bell came to see you three times,
is that right?

399
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,244
That's right.

400
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,847
- It would have been four times, only...
- What is this?

401
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,419
Last night we matched the soil sample
taken from Paula Bell's carpet

402
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,713
to a sample taken from your yard.

403
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,440
I went inside, I told you that.

404
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:32,069
We also matched it to a sample
taken from Bridget Kelly's room.

405
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,614
Bridget came by here to
pick up a letter of recommendation.

406
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,393
Am I a suspect, Dana?

407
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,077
Am I a fucking suspect?

408
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,731
All three victims had been in to see you
before they were attacked.

409
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,150
I found Paula, for Christ's sake.

410
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,445
- What was it that made you go to her house?
- She missed her appointment.

411
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,822
So you went to her house?

412
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,075
Yes, because she was a screw-up
and I have a responsibility.

413
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,577
- What's your blood type, Andy?
- O positive.

414
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,079
See, as luck would have it,

415
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,374
you have the same blood type
as the perpetrator.

416
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,459
Dana, this is crazy.

417
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,186
In my entire life
I have never harmed anyone.

418
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,190
I believe you.
I don't think you're the guy.

419
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,818
Thank you.

420
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,932
I need you to do something for me.

421
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:21,811
It's procedural, I wouldn't be doing
my job if I didn't ask you to do it.

422
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,021
Do what?

423
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:27,374
I need a sperm sample to test
against the one taken from the victims.

424
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,569
I can't believe this.

425
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:34,214
It's a simple thing, take maybe in an hour.
You'll be eliminated as a suspect.

426
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,759
What if I refuse?

427
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,346
You get to wear my handcuffs.

428
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,006
- Damn.
- No, no. That's much better.

429
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,591
- No, it's not.
- No, it is.

430
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,776
At least you're not
hitting innocent bystanders.

431
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,534
Beautiful.

432
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,039
Andy.

433
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,209
Andy.

434
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,890
Oh, God.

435
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,643
911. Emergency.

436
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:16,399
The rotator cuff, if you don't mind,
it's right in here, okay.

437
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:21,029
I pierce that, he can't even comb
his hair, let alone throw a ball.

438
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,228
That thing's been beeping all night.
Are you a drug dealer?

439
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,287
Yeah, you can say that.

440
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,623
Stanley.

441
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,239
Somebody talk to me.

442
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,616
We've got massive hemorrhaging.
It's probably an ovary.

443
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,285
We'll have some more numbers
in a few minutes.

444
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,079
- Blood type.
- AB negative. We need more.

445
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,583
Tanya, get a hold of the Mass General,
Boston, and Mercy, Hartford, in that order.

446
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,141
If they're low, we're gonna need donors.

447
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,527
I'm sorry we had to
put you through this, Andy.

448
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,946
You can go home now.

449
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,865
Andy.

450
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,371
- Mr. Safian.
- Yeah.

451
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,795
Your wife's name came up on a 911.
It's a medical emergency.

452
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,784
- David, what's the blood pressure?
- 93 above 57.

453
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,912
- Heart rate?
- 86.

454
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,622
- Quick count?
- 27.

455
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,515
Jed, did you see this?

456
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,731
Four to five weeks would be my guess.

457
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,137
- She is pregnant?
- Not for long.

458
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,447
Her fetus will abort
from the trauma of the procedure.

459
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,918
Whenever you're ready, doctor.

460
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:03,965
Dr. Hill.

461
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,264
All right, let's go.

462
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,937
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

463
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,017
- Mr. Safian.
- Yeah.

464
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,979
- What happened to my wife?
- She's bleeding internally.

465
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,956
Dr. Hill will come and talk to you
soon as her condition is stabilized.

466
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,127
- Is she conscious?
- I'm sorry Mr. Safian, that's all I know.

467
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,414
We're almost done.
I just wanna have one last look around.

468
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,873
Check for rings and watches.

469
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,724
- Suction.
- Suction.

470
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,050
All right, I think we've got it all.

471
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,692
It's amazing it didn't rupture sooner.

472
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,657
Jed.

473
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,911
We've got some pathology
in the second ovary.

474
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,460
- Let me have a look in here. Harrington.
- Harrington.

475
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,964
It was torsed when I unpacked it.

476
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,385
Think it's necrotic?

477
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,039
All right I want to do a frozen section
right away,

478
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,623
see if we still get a viable ovary here.

479
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,334
- We can't.
- Why not?

480
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,587
- The pathologist isn't in house.
- Well, what do I do for frozen section?

481
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,048
- We can call him in.
- How long would that take?

482
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,174
30, 40 minutes.

483
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,009
Hell, I'd better get a microscope
and do it myself.

484
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,596
It'll take at least a half an hour
for the processor to warm up.

485
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,931
- What's the pressure?
- 78.

486
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,741
- I don't have that kind of time.
- You got maybe half that, tops.

487
00:40:56,704 --> 00:41:00,999
All right. Irrigate and try to
get the BP back up. I'll be right back.

488
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,201
- Come with me.
- What's going on?

489
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,968
Just come with me.

490
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,605
I had to remove one of Tracy's ovaries.

491
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:29,303
It ruptured. A large cyst had developed
and that what was causing her pain.

492
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,155
I have to be direct with you
because we're little under the gun.

493
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,241
- Is it under control?
- Not yet.

494
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,438
There is a problem
with Tracy's second ovary.

495
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:43,583
We discovered it was torsed or twisted
around in its own blood supply.

496
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,654
If I remove it, I'm simply
removing a dead organ

497
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,590
and in all likelihood
Tracy will lead a normal, healthy life.

498
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,467
But...

499
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,306
She won't ever be able to have children.

500
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,894
If I close her up now, she could die of
toxic-shock in the middle of the night.

501
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,276
Do whatever you have to do.

502
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,405
- Tracy's gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

503
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,810
- But what?
- I'll tell you later.

504
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,119
No. No, tell me now.

505
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,008
Tracy was pregnant. Of four weeks.

506
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,095
- Tracy is pregnant?
- No Andy.

507
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,957
The fetus aborted.

508
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,935
She sustained a lot of trauma.
There was nothing that could be done.

509
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,022
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

510
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,827
Vascular clamp.

511
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:21,582
Dr. Hill, I think this might be a mistake.
How do you know it's not still viable?

512
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:25,518
This is the wife of a friend, Matthew.
I'm not taking any chances. Scalpel.

513
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,229
You could be taking out a viable ovary.

514
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,595
It's necrotic. Scalpel.

515
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,430
Without the histology,
you can't be sure.

516
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,864
I'm sure.

517
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,826
Tanya, give me the scalpel.

518
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,081
Jed.

519
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,547
- What you got there, George?
- It's from pathology.

520
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,969
The Histology report?

521
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,182
We took out a healthy ovary.

522
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,268
Only the surface was necrotic.

523
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,606
Jed, take this.

524
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,611
Look at it.

525
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,947
Then burn it.

526
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,771
That's a nice gesture, George. Really.

527
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,900
The technician owes me a favor.
Lab won't be a problem.

528
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,611
It'll be a problem for me.

529
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,130
This hospital took out a healthy ovary.

530
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:20,091
I took out the ovary. No one else.

531
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:24,971
It was a judgment call
and I stand by it.

532
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,354
- Are you gonna be all right?
- I'll be fine.

533
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,693
I didn't do anything wrong.

534
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,242
I figured you probably hadn't
eaten anything in a while.

535
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,843
We should talk later, okay?

536
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,749
Well, Andy, I wanted to have
a word with Tracy.

537
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,418
Maybe later, okay? Jed...

538
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,519
Hello, Mrs. Safian.

539
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,091
You gave us quite a scare.

540
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,524
Did I?

541
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,570
Tracy, I know you've been told
all about what's happened.

542
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,697
Yes.

543
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:28,034
I don't know if there's any point in
telling you how sorry I am.

544
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,371
I spoke with a lawyer this morning.

545
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,043
I want to make sure you don't
do this to someone else.

546
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,131
There'll be some depositions
in about a week.

547
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,175
I think we can bring them down from
the 30 million in a settlement.

548
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,594
Let's not dick each other around here.

549
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:05,597
30 million, 25 million,
what difference does it make?

550
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,558
You know anything
over 10 million dollars

551
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,144
and I can't get insurance in this
or any other state.

552
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,146
- I say we go to a jury.
- I can't recommend that.

553
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,355
Why not?

554
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,774
Let me tell you what a jury sees.

555
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:19,945
A jury sees a beautiful young woman
married to a mild-mannered teacher.

556
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:23,615
They buy an old house and dream of
filling it up with children.

557
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,492
Now that is a Norman Rockwell painting

558
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,829
and you have ripped it to shreds
with your scalpel.

559
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,998
You are my lawyer. Am I right here?

560
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,000
It's not my job
to hold your hand, doctor.

561
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,043
It's not your job
to be an asshole either, counselor,

562
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,587
but that doesn't seem
to be stopping here.

563
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,729
Maybe if we all calm down.

564
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,051
We could bring in a private investigator,
dig up something on her background.

565
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,722
Lester, she volunteered five days a week
in a children's ward.

566
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,099
And baked cookies for the staff.

567
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,935
Looks like you picked the
wrong patient to screw up on, doctor.

568
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:56,873
I didn't pick her, counselor.
Physicians don't get to choose.

569
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,527
I'll need an 'expert.
Who do you want to call?

570
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:04,698
- What do you mean?
- An expert. Someone to make a statement.

571
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,033
A statement saying what?

572
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,801
A statement saying that
you are as good as you think you are.

573
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:17,810
Call Dr. Martin Kessler.
Harvard Medical School.

574
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,631
Is that it, Miss?

575
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,814
Yes.

576
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,613
- How will I get in touch with you?
- You won't.

577
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,615
I don't want you to.

578
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,786
Tracy, why won't you let me help you
get through this?

579
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,831
This isn't a phase, Andy.

580
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,961
I can't have children. Ever.

581
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,797
He thought you were going to die.

582
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,051
Right about now he's wishing I did.

583
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,554
Tracy, I love you.

584
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,351
He took my insides out,

585
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,228
and you gave him permission.

586
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,194
Goodbye, Andy.

587
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:31,618
Dr. Kessler, would you describe
your history and relationship to Dr. Hill?

588
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:35,163
Dr. Hill was a student of mine
at medical school.

589
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,000
Upon graduation I asked him
to serve his residency

590
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,836
under my direction at Mass General.

591
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:45,966
And when he finished the residency,
I asked him to join our surgical staff.

592
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,719
Dr. Kessler, how long have you been
teaching at Harvard Medical school?

593
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,944
Twenty-one years.

594
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,930
How long have you been
chief of staff at Mass General?

595
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,015
Fourteen years.

596
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,184
So you've been in a position to work with
thousands of young doctors. Am I correct?

597
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,311
Yes.

598
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,939
I might add that the doctors I've had
the pleasure to teach and work with

599
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,124
are among the very best in the world.

600
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,237
And how would Dr. Hill rank in this group
that are among the very best in the world?

601
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,922
- There's no one any better.
- Thank you.

602
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:11,966
Mr. Riley.

603
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,762
Dr. Kessler, your faith in Dr. Hill's
surgical talent is obvious.

604
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:18,889
And completely deserved.

605
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,210
Dr. Kessler, seven months ago
the position of Chief of Surgery

606
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,629
became available on Mass General.

607
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:24,922
Did Jed Hill seek this position?

608
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,173
Yes, he did.

609
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:30,067
- Did you give the position to Jed?
- Excuse me, my client's name is Dr. Hill.

610
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,194
Forgive me,
did you award the position to Dr. Hill?

611
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,598
- No.
- Why not?

612
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,032
Well, he was certainly qualified...

613
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,185
But you didn't give him the job.

614
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,785
There were many other candidates.

615
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,122
- Surgeons more qualified?
- This isn't a trial, Mr. Riley.

616
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,109
Dr. Kessler, during Dr. Hill's
residency in Mass General

617
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,028
you wrote several quarterly evaluations.

618
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:52,074
Evaluations to be read and reviewed
by hospital administrators,

619
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,367
department heads.

620
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,701
Yes.

621
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:58,705
I'm looking at one right now

622
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:02,292
dated June 15th, 1982,
and bearing your signature.

623
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,185
It's coming around.

624
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:13,971
I'd like to read from page three,
paragraph four.

625
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,056
"While Jed Hill consistently remains
the most skilled

626
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,224
"and the brightest of our residents,

627
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,559
"we should not ignore what I and several
of his colleagues observed

628
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,911
"to be an indulgence
of the 'God complex'."

629
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,040
"God complex." That's not a typo, was it?
It says "God complex."

630
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,919
That was written a decade ago.

631
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,837
What's a God complex?

632
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,866
How did you get this information?
This was privileged information.

633
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,093
Dr. Kessler, what's a God complex?

634
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:42,416
It's a term that has no clinical meaning
at all. Doctors throw it around...

635
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,183
Sir, with all due respect,
but knock it off.

636
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:47,228
What did you mean in this evaluation
when you said Dr. Hill had a God complex?

637
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:53,400
The power to heal can be
an enormous thing, an enormous thing.

638
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:59,141
To save a life, to get blood flowing
into cells and vital organs.

639
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:04,870
If a person can do that, and if one
can do it as exceptionally as Dr. Hill,

640
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:10,459
it's not uncommon for a person like that
to begin to believe that he can do anything.

641
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:15,047
The power to heal can be like a drug.

642
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,783
"Like a drug", you're saying?

643
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:20,678
Would it be uncommon for a person with a
God complex to reject the advice of others?

644
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,680
No.

645
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,626
Would it be uncommon for such a person
to proceed on a course

646
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,270
that others might reject if only
out of a sense of a God like power?

647
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,923
I think now you're vastly overstating.

648
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:35,635
- Is that why you didn't give Dr. Hill the job?
- There were a number of other factors.

649
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,638
Is that why you removed a healthy ovary
without any scientific diagnosis?

650
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:41,141
Don't you address my client, Mr. Riley.

651
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,741
Do you have a God complex?

652
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,019
This is not acceptable.

653
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,370
- No, no. Let him address me.
- Jed.

654
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,665
No, no. It's about time.
I got to give some answers here.

655
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,917
Stop typing. This is off the record.

656
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,090
The question is,
do I have a God complex?

657
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,800
Dr. Kessler says yes.

658
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,621
Which makes me wonder

659
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:08,684
if this lawyer has any idea

660
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,130
as to the kind of grades
one has to receive in college

661
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,982
to be accepted at a top medical school.

662
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:19,679
If you have the vaguest clue
as to how talented someone has to be

663
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,864
to lead a surgical team.

664
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,186
I have an M.D. from Harvard,

665
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:29,189
I am board certified
in cardio-thoracic medicine

666
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,233
and trauma surgery,

667
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,692
I have been awarded citations

668
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,695
from seven different medical boards
in New England,

669
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:39,950
and I am never, ever sick at sea.

670
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,369
So I ask you,

671
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,870
when someone goes into that chapel

672
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,456
and they fall on their knees
and they pray to God

673
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,625
that their wife doesn't miscarry

674
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,128
or that their daughter
doesn't bleed to death,

675
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:56,716
or that their mother doesn't suffer acute
neural trauma from post-operative shock,

676
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,817
who do you think they're praying to?

677
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:06,518
Now, go ahead and read your Bible, Dennis,
and you go to your church,

678
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,312
and, with any luck,
you might win the annual raffle,

679
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,898
but if you're looking for God,

680
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:15,569
he was in operating room number two
on November 17,

681
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,504
and he doesn't like
to be second guessed.

682
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:24,995
You ask me if I have a God complex.
Let me tell you something.

683
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,845
I am God.

684
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,474
And this sideshow is over.

685
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,638
You got a winner here, Lester.

686
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:46,573
Call my office in the morning
and we'll work out a settlement.

687
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,910
- It gets better.
- What do you mean?

688
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,789
We talked to the bartender
of a place called Prince William Tavern.

689
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:58,210
Ask God how many shots of bourbon
he had before he cut me open.

690
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,953
The insurance company will wire a draft

691
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,122
into my firm's account
by sometime next week.

692
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,290
Assuming you sign it right away,

693
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,501
you should get your money
few days after that.

694
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,253
Listen, there are some things
we should discuss now,

695
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,630
like an umbrella policy.

696
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,673
Dennis, this isn't such
a good time for me.

697
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,592
Tracy, we're talking about $20 million.

698
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,803
Dennis, I think about what I want
for breakfast, I start crying.

699
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,989
You can put the money in a coffee can,
for all I care.

700
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,697
- It's after 8:30.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

701
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,993
- You should go home.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

702
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,005
Mrs. Worthington.

703
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,758
Mrs. Worthington.

704
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,947
Mr. Leemus.

705
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,501
Mr. Leemus.

706
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

707
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,222
Jesus!

708
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,016
You surprised me.

709
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,645
I was working on the furnace.
I didn't know anybody else was here.

710
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,174
I saw the lights...

711
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,635
It's my mother's hair.

712
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,570
She's not alive anymore.
That's her in the picture.

713
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,727
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get any of your things.

714
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:02,397
- That's okay.
- I just, I...

715
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:06,875
I came down to get a light bulb.
I didn't realize that...

716
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:13,048
- You live down here?
- No, no. Just for a while.

717
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:16,744
My landlady asked me to leave,
put me in a tight spot.

718
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:19,289
I won't stay here long. No.
I promise, Mr. Safian.

719
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,709
No, you stay here
as long as you want, Earl.

720
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,587
- I'll just take this and I'll head back out.
- Sure.

721
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:28,313
- Good night, Mr. Safian.
- Good night, Earl.

722
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

723
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:53,049
Don't worry,
you don't look as bad as the other guy.

724
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,567
So help me God, I could have killed him.

725
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:00,822
Junior, have you met the professor?
A very tough guy.

726
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,661
If you want something done all right,
goddamn it, you call a teacher.

727
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,623
Let me buy you a drink.

728
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:23,428
You know, there is one thing
I realized during all of this.

729
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:28,918
Jed had just come out of the OR
to talk to me. He was covered in blood

730
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,962
and he was telling me
what he was about to do

731
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:34,465
and then he needed
my permission to do it.

732
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:39,220
And there was a second,
maybe a second and a half,

733
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,015
between him telling me
that Tracy was pregnant

734
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:45,325
and him telling me that the fetus
was aborted during surgery.

735
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:51,373
And that second, that second and a half,

736
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:56,294
that was the happiest time in my life.

737
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:05,804
That is a horrible story.
It's the worst story I've ever heard.

738
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,933
And I appreciate your words of comfort.

739
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,712
I mean it, Andy.

740
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:16,523
You're like a fucking Job,
shit just happens to you.

741
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:22,988
Have you had a lot of success
talking jumpers in from window ledges?

742
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:30,412
- Let me ask you something.
- Sure.

743
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,581
How well do you know Tracy?

744
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:37,127
She's my wife. What do you mean?

745
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:48,998
My brothers, my friends,
and my ex-husband

746
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:53,185
Have all accused me of wielding my sense
of honesty like a blunt instrument.

747
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:57,606
I don't want to hurt you anymore
than you have been,

748
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:02,778
but I'm fairly sure
I'm doing the right thing.

749
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,113
What are you talking about?

750
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,328
I want you to come back to the station
with me.

751
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,581
I wanna show you something.

752
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:42,400
- Sir? Sir, can I help you?
- I'm gonna see Jed Hill.

753
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,043
What the hell happened to you?

754
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,087
It wasn't my baby.

755
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,755
What?

756
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,632
It wasn't my baby.

757
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,468
Come inside.
What the hell happened to your face?

758
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,998
Doesn't matter. You know what this is?

759
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,917
This is a police test.
It's a lab report.

760
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,127
I don't understand.

761
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:19,172
It is a sperm sample I made
after the Paula Bell rape.

762
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,689
I'm sterile.

763
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,609
Can I have a look at that, please?

764
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:28,738
I can't have any children,
so it wasn't my baby.

765
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,976
You got to call your lawyer, Jed.

766
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:34,562
You call your lawyer,
you have 'em tell the insurance company

767
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:37,789
to stop the presses because this thing,
no, it's not over yet.

768
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,567
Andy, this isn't about me.

769
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,944
It's about both of us, Jed.

770
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,755
She reamed both of us. It's too late for me,
but it's not too late for you.

771
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:50,036
Andy, I don't mean to seem indelicate,
but as far as my situation is concerned,

772
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:53,555
it doesn't matter if Tracy was sleeping
with the Boston Celtics.

773
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,641
I took out her reproductive system.

774
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:01,339
It was a wrong call
and the bill was $20 million.

775
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:06,219
No. That's where you're wrong. See,
the $20 million is a big settlement, right?

776
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:10,223
That wasn't for the fuck-up.
That was for the victim.

777
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:11,933
The insurance company
settled high and fast

778
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:14,826
because they thought
they're up against Snow White.

779
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:19,623
What happens if Snow White is shacking up
with her lawyer Jed, huh?

780
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:21,458
You tell me.

781
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,237
Andy, you're hurt and you want revenge.

782
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:28,533
And I can understand that,
but I got what I deserved.

783
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:32,203
And you know something,
as much as this pains you,

784
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:34,846
no matter what Tracy
was doing behind your back,

785
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:38,058
she got a hell of a lot worse
than she deserved.

786
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,187
Did I?

787
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:47,108
- Did you what?
- Did I get what I deserved?

788
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:52,849
Bad things happen to good people
all the time, Andy, and for no reason.

789
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,157
Take my word for it.

790
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:59,537
I'll see you later.

791
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,416
What are you gonna do, Andy?

792
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:08,088
I'm gonna go out
and get to know my wife.

793
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:23,921
Hi, Dennis!

794
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:26,173
He doesn't have an appointment, Mr. Riley.
He just walked right in.

795
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:27,925
She tried to stop me, Dennis.

796
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:30,177
See, I can call him Dennis
'cause we're old friends.

797
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:31,778
We both slept with my wife.

798
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,196
Claudia, call security.

799
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:36,142
Do that Claudia
and then call the US Attorney's office

800
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,561
and see if conspiracy
to commit insurance fraud

801
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,146
comes under their jurisdiction.

802
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,288
- Forget security, Claudia.
- Sir?

803
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,874
Just close the door behind you.
Thank you.

804
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:55,135
This... This is a nice office.

805
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:57,595
What the hell happened to your face?

806
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:02,350
I beat the shit out
of a deeply disturbed serial rapist.

807
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:07,063
Hey, I want an explanation.

808
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:08,773
An explanation for what?

809
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:13,319
For how my wife could have been pregnant
when her husband's sterile?

810
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:18,517
What was it? Immaculate conception?

811
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:22,579
If that's the case, Dennis, I wouldn't have
settled for $20 million if I were you.

812
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,691
Andy, I had no knowledge of this.

813
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,251
And I wasn't sleeping with your wife,
if that's what you're suggesting.

814
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:30,795
Bullshit.

815
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,049
Then what can I do for you, Andy?

816
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,634
You can tell me where Tracy is.

817
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,830
Telling you where Tracy is
would break an attorney-client privilege,

818
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,874
and I will not do that.

819
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:43,084
Now there is nothing more I can do.

820
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,435
Claudia will be happy
to call the US Attorney for you.

821
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,272
Were you sleeping with her?

822
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:50,940
No.

823
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:57,405
Can you help me?

824
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,242
Help you do what?
What is it you want, Andy?

825
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,027
I want to talk to Tracy.

826
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:12,071
- Andy...
- I know I'm asking you a favor.

827
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:15,449
I have a professional obligation.
I have a legal obligation to my client.

828
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:19,912
Your problems, your questions,
cold as this may seem, are not my business.

829
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,122
And I haven't got the answers you want.

830
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:22,832
Even if I did,
I wouldn't be able to give them to you.

831
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,375
Talk to her friends, talk to her mother,

832
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:27,169
talk to the people she works with
at the hospital.

833
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:30,006
- What did you say?
- I'm saying this is a personal matter.

834
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,689
Did you say, "Talk to her mother?"

835
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:33,566
She certainly knows Tracy
better than I do.

836
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,235
Her mother is dead.

837
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:39,280
- When did she die?
- Twelve years ago.

838
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,366
You handled the estate.

839
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:44,577
No, I didn't.

840
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:46,371
What are you saying to me?

841
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,066
I'm saying I didn't handle
Mrs. Kennsinger's estate,

842
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:51,610
and anything outside of the framework
of your wife's lawsuit is not my...

843
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,612
I don't give a fuck
about the lawsuit, Dennis.

844
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:55,781
- All I'm asking you...
- Then we have nothing here to talk about.

845
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,716
Is her mother alive?
Where does she live?

846
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:02,178
- Please understand...
- Fuck it. I'll find her myself.

847
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,347
Andy.

848
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:08,518
- Scotch.
- What?

849
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,020
Bring her a bottle of scotch.

850
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:38,756
- My name is Andy Safian.
- So what?

851
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,177
Did your daughter ever tell you
she had a husband?

852
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:44,830
Did your wife ever tell you
she had a mother?

853
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,165
Yeah.

854
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,348
You're a liar.

855
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:50,268
She said you were dead.

856
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:53,714
What do you want from me?

857
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:57,066
- It's nothing. I just thought...
- Nobody wants nothing.

858
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:01,154
I thought maybe we could
have a drink and talk.

859
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,240
She sure loved her daddy.

860
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,159
Second best confidence man
south of Boston.

861
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:25,955
He taught her everything.
She was daddy's girl.

862
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,666
I wanted to ask you some questions.

863
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,683
She tried to do the smart thing,
I give her that.

864
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,337
The smart thing. What was that?

865
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:35,313
Marry a bank account. What do you think?

866
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:37,023
Tracy was married before?

867
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,984
I said she tried.

868
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:43,055
You got to pay attention.

869
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,349
One of Bill's old partners,
a guy from Newport.

870
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:47,867
Millionaire with a heart problem.

871
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:52,705
He wouldn't marry her though.
Not even after she got pregnant.

872
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,832
Mrs. Kennsinger, I...

873
01:10:57,294 --> 01:11:00,948
This is single malt scotch.

874
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:03,284
That was so classy, mister.

875
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,510
I haven't had single malt since '69.

876
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:12,251
I drink crap. Blended whiskey is crap,
I don't give what color the label is.

877
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,519
I need to find Tracy.

878
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:17,897
Tell me the part again where she was
working with children's ward.

879
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:22,694
Like I told you, she likes kids.
So she...

880
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:25,947
What?

881
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,199
What?

882
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,952
Did I say something funny?

883
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:37,041
That girls sure found herself a live one.
Like shooting tuna fish in a barrel.

884
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,714
Big one, too.

885
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,303
You're drunk.

886
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:50,471
And you're stupid.

887
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:55,685
I can say that to you because
you're my son-in-law.

888
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:57,937
Want to see something?

889
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:00,940
I want you to tell me where Tracy is.

890
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:05,069
I'm older, I'm smarter.
You can learn something from me.

891
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:07,655
I know she's been here.

892
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:12,368
Andy. Is it Andy?

893
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,412
- Yeah.
- Andy.

894
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:18,484
It's a simple trick.

895
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,860
The statue...

896
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,655
- What?
- This, the Degas.

897
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,324
Yeah. What about it?

898
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:29,677
It was in my house. It was Tracy's.
So I know she's been here.

899
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:33,097
Andy, believe me.

900
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:35,834
You need to see this trick.

901
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,769
- Do you get that I'm serious?
- Pick a card.

902
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:41,356
I got it. Pick a card.

903
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:54,243
Look at it.

904
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,289
Put it back in the deck.

905
01:13:05,672 --> 01:13:07,825
Shuffle the deck.

906
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:10,968
- Mrs. Kennsinger, I don't want...
- You can call me "Mom."

907
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:15,098
I don't think so.

908
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:20,144
Shuffle the cards.
And shuffle them good.

909
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,883
Bill and me, we used to give Tracy
a little bit of the money each week

910
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:27,819
so she could buy candy.
Shuffle the cards!

911
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:35,118
She wouldn't spend it though, not a penny.
Each week she put it under the mattress.

912
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:39,831
I swear I think that kid had maybe
200 bucks under the mattress.

913
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:44,403
I'll tell you something else
about Tracy.

914
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:45,863
I don't think it bothered her a bit

915
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:49,340
when her father cleaned out
the bank accounts and disappeared.

916
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:55,847
I think it bothered her when he took
the 200 dollars from under the mattress.

917
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,350
Jesus. What the hell
kind of a family is this?

918
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:02,629
- Want to bet me a double-C?
- What?

919
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:05,424
200 bucks. You wanna give me 200 bucks
if I know what your card is?

920
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:07,024
I'll give you 200 bucks if I don't.

921
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:08,693
No.

922
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:12,014
Because once money is involved,
you take me seriously, right?

923
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,224
Look, you said there was
a point here and I...

924
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:16,935
Why do you give a Frenchman's fuck
who she was sleeping with?

925
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:19,912
Get into the game.
Go for the 20 million yourself.

926
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,208
Are you saying that Tracy set this up?

927
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:28,880
What the hell have I been telling you?
Am I talking to my shadow?

928
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:33,285
You think you're Sherlock Holmes
with this statue?

929
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:35,954
You can buy them in any
departmental store for $89.95.

930
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,331
Looks just like the real thing.

931
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:42,727
The whole thing was a setup?
You're crazy.

932
01:14:44,104 --> 01:14:45,229
Yeah?

933
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:48,774
Then how come I have the jack of clubs
in my fucking pocket?

934
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:03,482
Look, kid, I don't know
what the game is.

935
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:05,958
But you got stung,
so did your friend, the surgeon.

936
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:11,088
Maybe, it's best to just take a medicine
like a good little boy and go home.

937
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:15,760
Do me a favor. Leave me this scotch.

938
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:22,975
Whatever happened to the baby?

939
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:27,146
- What baby?
- The Newport millionaire, the baby.

940
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:31,051
She pocketed the money
he gave her for an abortion.

941
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:33,986
Went downtown to a clinic.
She ended up working for the doctor.

942
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,516
There's a happy ending, though.

943
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:40,727
She disappeared with 80,000
of the clinic's money.

944
01:15:40,827 --> 01:15:43,856
- How much of that do you think I saw?
- What was the name of the doctor?

945
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,816
How much you think I'm going to see
from this 20 million?

946
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:48,125
Was the name of the doctor
David Lillianfield?

947
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:50,487
How much do you think she's gonna give
her dead mother?

948
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:52,030
- Was it?
- Was what what?

949
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,158
You think you can drink like this
and remember a name?

950
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:57,301
Was the name of the doctor
David Lillianfield?

951
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:02,139
Welcome to the game.

952
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:53,399
Hello.

953
01:16:58,488 --> 01:16:59,864
Excuse me.

954
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:02,617
Can I talk to your manager?

955
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:11,985
Mr. Hearn leaves at 5:00.
You're gonna have to come back tomorrow.

956
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:13,320
I'm Dr. Lillianfield.

957
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:17,965
Mr. Hearn wanted me to come by to fill out
a change of address card for your billing.

958
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:33,272
- Was that Lillianfield?
- Yeah. David.

959
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:40,097
All right. Why don't you just write it
on the back of the old card

960
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,599
and we'll take care
of the rest tomorrow.

961
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:44,033
Okay. Thanks.

962
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,669
Where is the key?

963
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,677
I'm soaked.

964
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:52,429
God! I'm freezing.

965
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,599
It's cold in here.

966
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:00,437
We must do something about the latch.

967
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:02,940
We got to get this latch fixed.

968
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,236
This damn door is driving me crazy.

969
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,409
I'm chilled to the bone.

970
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,293
Warm me up, I'm freezing.

971
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,968
Take me upstairs and fuck me.

972
01:24:11,629 --> 01:24:13,865
I should be heading back to town.

973
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:15,174
We just got here.

974
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:18,635
I know, but it's broad daylight.

975
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,930
Relax. It's a done deal.

976
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:24,892
I'm cutting the check on Monday.

977
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,229
What's wrong with you?

978
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:33,150
- I got a letter today.
- From who?

979
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:36,570
Whom, from whom. From Dr. Kessler.

980
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:38,765
What did he say?

981
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:41,184
He didn't say, Tracy.
It was a letter. He wrote.

982
01:24:41,284 --> 01:24:45,996
Jed, take a drink, take a pill, do whatever
it is you have to, but lighten the fuck up.

983
01:24:46,122 --> 01:24:47,664
What did he write?

984
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:52,377
That he was sorry.
That he was very sorry.

985
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:56,006
That was thoughtful of him.

986
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:59,593
- What?
- That was.

987
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:02,205
The man put us over the top.
I was in the room.

988
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:05,557
The bartender was just icing,
but Kessler was the one who closed it.

989
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:09,144
Come on,
what more do you want from the man?

990
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,981
I want him to know it.

991
01:25:13,733 --> 01:25:17,721
I want him to know
that I was holding the strings.

992
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,948
He's sorry? Let him say
he was sorry about Mass General.

993
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:25,311
When he says he was wrong, when
he says that I should have gotten the job,

994
01:25:25,411 --> 01:25:29,748
then you talk about bygones
being bygones.

995
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:40,551
In the meantime,
I think I'll send him a postcard.

996
01:25:40,718 --> 01:25:43,121
There, that's the spirit.

997
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:47,292
A picture of me sitting under a palm tree
with $10 million in one hand

998
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:51,228
and a copy of his God complex memo
in the other.

999
01:25:52,188 --> 01:25:55,175
- With an inscription.
- What would it say?

1000
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:57,010
It wouldn't say anything. It would read.

1001
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,777
Attagirl, Trace.

1002
01:25:58,903 --> 01:25:59,987
What would it read?

1003
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:04,908
"Never underestimate
a genius with a chip on his shoulder."

1004
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,993
Shit! What the fuck was that?

1005
01:27:33,998 --> 01:27:36,041
Oh, my God!

1006
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:38,168
Where did that come from?

1007
01:27:39,545 --> 01:27:41,171
Andy.

1008
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:42,506
What?

1009
01:27:43,549 --> 01:27:45,535
Andy's been here.

1010
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:47,511
What are you talking about?

1011
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:49,706
He knows.

1012
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:52,599
Then why aren't the police
knocking on the door?

1013
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:55,086
Because he's playing with us.

1014
01:27:55,186 --> 01:27:56,421
- Andy?
- Yes.

1015
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:58,021
I don't believe it.

1016
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,257
Believe it.

1017
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:00,341
How could he possibly...

1018
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:02,859
Well, let's think about that
for a moment, shall we?

1019
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,638
What could we have done wrong?

1020
01:28:05,738 --> 01:28:07,098
Let's retrace the plan

1021
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:11,519
and see if we can put our finger
on a detail we may have overlooked.

1022
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:13,396
One of us may have improvised.

1023
01:28:13,496 --> 01:28:16,774
One of us may have decided that
to get pregnant would double the money.

1024
01:28:16,874 --> 01:28:18,234
It did double the money.

1025
01:28:18,334 --> 01:28:20,862
Now I don't want to hear
about it anymore. It is history.

1026
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:22,546
No, no, no kidding.

1027
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:24,032
It's the present.

1028
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:27,134
It's the here and the now
and the needle in the haystack.

1029
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,287
Let me ask you something.

1030
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:31,164
Once he found out he was sterile,

1031
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:35,293
how long do you think it took him
to figure out there was no Dr. Lillianfield?

1032
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:37,311
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1033
01:28:37,937 --> 01:28:40,605
There wasn't supposed to be a baby.

1034
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:46,403
I'll take care of Andy.

1035
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:12,846
Don't get up.

1036
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:18,294
What happened to your face?

1037
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:19,686
I tripped.

1038
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:23,591
I heard they caught the guy, the rapist.

1039
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:24,858
Yeah.

1040
01:29:25,276 --> 01:29:27,986
Well, that must be a load off your mind.

1041
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:32,074
Yeah, it's great
to finally have things back to normal.

1042
01:29:33,701 --> 01:29:37,204
Andy, they can be back to normal.

1043
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:39,748
What's that?

1044
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:42,793
Things.

1045
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,379
Our life.

1046
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,383
Remember me?

1047
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,765
- Tracy.
- What?

1048
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:00,310
I think you dropped your shoe.

1049
01:30:04,148 --> 01:30:05,524
What can I get you?

1050
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:08,235
We'll have two glasses of house wine.

1051
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:11,347
- Is chardonnay all right?
- It'll be fine.

1052
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:13,657
- Anything else?
- Some privacy.

1053
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:18,604
Sweetie, I'm going to talk for a minute,

1054
01:30:18,704 --> 01:30:21,706
so it would be better
if you don't interrupt me, okay?

1055
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:25,252
I found a hypodermic needle in my bed.

1056
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:28,839
I don't know who put it there,
it doesn't matter.

1057
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:32,968
What matters
is that I didn't think it was funny.

1058
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:36,054
And as you well know,
I've a healthy sense of humor.

1059
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:39,141
So what I'm saying is this.

1060
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:45,188
Whoever played that joke is playing
in a league they're just not ready for.

1061
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:50,318
Now, I came here
hoping we could reach an understanding.

1062
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:54,891
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
hold a grudge on this one, Trace.

1063
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,435
Go to cops. They'll call you crazy.

1064
01:30:57,535 --> 01:31:00,396
As would Westerly or any another school
at which you try and get a teaching job.

1065
01:31:00,496 --> 01:31:01,481
Happy hunting, Andy.

1066
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,582
- Sit the fuck down!
- What?

1067
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:06,293
I said sit the fuck down.

1068
01:31:07,086 --> 01:31:08,753
I'm running the show now.

1069
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:14,426
You're running it
with an empty hypodermic needle?

1070
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,304
I'm running it
with trace amounts of Pergonal.

1071
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:26,480
Here you go.

1072
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:32,970
Ma'am, would you happen to know
anything about a drug called Pergonal?

1073
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,529
I'm sorry.

1074
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:35,947
Never mind. That's all right.

1075
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:41,479
It's a fertility drug, Andy.
I was trying to get pregnant.

1076
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:45,916
A fertility drug. That's exactly
what the lab guys told me.

1077
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:48,319
But it turns out that Pergonal,

1078
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:53,131
when it's injected in, like, massive
quantities will actually create ovarian cysts.

1079
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:56,911
They gathered brilliant young surgeons
around, Trace,

1080
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:58,830
'cause you gave us all quite a scare.

1081
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:02,208
The hormone dissolved in the ovaries, you
wouldn't have a clue how much I was taking.

1082
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:03,642
That's right.

1083
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:06,504
It's not like I had a witness.

1084
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:10,174
I mean, if I had a witness
who saw Jed giving you the injections,

1085
01:32:10,274 --> 01:32:11,843
then you and doctor man

1086
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:14,345
would be spending
the rest of your sexually-active years

1087
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:17,322
in a place where if you're very, very good,
they'll let you work in the laundry.

1088
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:20,784
You're bluffing.

1089
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:22,562
Tracy.

1090
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:24,856
Right now,
more than anything else in the world,

1091
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:28,959
don't you wish I had finally gotten around
to putting up the curtains in the bedroom?

1092
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:31,670
Shit!

1093
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:33,505
Are you all right?

1094
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:37,952
- You should run that under some water.
- No, I'm fine.

1095
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:41,429
- Are you sure? Let me just...
- I said I'm fine!

1096
01:32:41,597 --> 01:32:42,764
Jesus!

1097
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,141
You spilled your wine, Trace.

1098
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:49,755
By the by,

1099
01:32:49,855 --> 01:32:54,442
you should know in case some bizarre,
active God should happen to take my life,

1100
01:32:54,902 --> 01:32:56,095
my will's been amended

1101
01:32:56,195 --> 01:32:59,990
to direct the police to the 10-year-old son
of our next-door neighbor.

1102
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:01,491
What do you want?

1103
01:33:03,619 --> 01:33:06,981
What does anybody want?
I want the Red Sox to win the World Series.

1104
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:09,150
You haven't taken the kid to the police.
What do you want?

1105
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,001
I had a chat with your mom.

1106
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:15,672
Not bad looking for somebody
who's been dead for 12 years.

1107
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:19,843
What do you want, Andy?

1108
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:22,929
I want to change my life, Tracy.

1109
01:33:23,222 --> 01:33:25,124
I don't think
Emma was stating the case either,

1110
01:33:25,224 --> 01:33:27,001
and she knows
some pretty cool card tricks.

1111
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,561
Cut the shit! What do you want?

1112
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:32,147
I want half.

1113
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:34,858
What the fuck do you think I want?

1114
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:51,692
Give him the money.

1115
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:53,110
What?

1116
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:56,129
Give the man the money,
and let's get out of here.

1117
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:59,951
Jesus, Jed. Don't fade on me.
I need you to focus on this thing.

1118
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:01,786
I'm telling you precisely what to do.

1119
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:04,789
Give the guy the 10 bucks
and we leave the country.

1120
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:08,683
I'm supposed to split the money three ways?
I'm supposed to just accept this?

1121
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:12,771
Welcome to the land
where you don't have a choice.

1122
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:16,509
Don't fucking turn on me.
I earned this money.

1123
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:18,803
This money is mine.
He's not getting a nickel.

1124
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:20,820
They write the check to me.

1125
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:23,156
Not in prison, they don't.

1126
01:34:27,536 --> 01:34:31,247
Without the kid,
he doesn't have anything.

1127
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:35,543
Without the kid, Andy is just a guy
who cracked under the strain.

1128
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:37,462
What?

1129
01:34:38,839 --> 01:34:40,131
Absolutely.

1130
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:45,220
Do you know what you're saying?

1131
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:46,971
What's the big leap, Jed?

1132
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:51,836
You cut me open, stuck your hands in,
twisted my ovaries, so they look all dead.

1133
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:53,129
Excuse me, necrotic.

1134
01:34:53,229 --> 01:34:55,840
Now you develop some enlightened sense
of what's right and wrong?

1135
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:57,341
- He's a child.
- No!

1136
01:34:57,441 --> 01:35:01,971
He is a fucking troll who deserves to be put
out of his misery for fucking up my life!

1137
01:35:02,071 --> 01:35:04,114
Now, if you don't have the balls to...

1138
01:35:09,829 --> 01:35:11,538
Don't talk about this again.

1139
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:18,044
Anything happens to the kid,
and I'm the State's star witness.

1140
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:21,339
Give the man the money.

1141
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:28,471
I'm sorry I hit you.

1142
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:41,276
Put it down.

1143
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:46,322
How much blood did you let me lose
before you saved me?

1144
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:49,393
You waited an extra minute or two,
didn't you?

1145
01:35:49,493 --> 01:35:51,812
You thought about going the other way
after you saw I was pregnant.

1146
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:54,690
You thought for a second
about letting me die, didn't you?

1147
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:57,625
- I'm a doctor.
- You were a doctor.

1148
01:35:59,378 --> 01:36:01,421
Don't overestimate yourself, Tracy.

1149
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:05,341
Give me the gun.

1150
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:09,596
Come on.

1151
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,505
- Hello?
- It's me.

1152
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:27,382
I have the money.

1153
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:30,802
- Where are you?
- I'm at Market Square.

1154
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:34,848
Meet me in the northwest corner
in 15 minutes.

1155
01:40:08,919 --> 01:40:10,753
Like shooting tuna in a barrel.

1156
01:40:37,948 --> 01:40:39,532
I won't mind shooting you.

1157
01:40:43,537 --> 01:40:45,356
What took you so long?

1158
01:40:45,456 --> 01:40:47,290
We were waiting for Jed.

1159
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:50,543
Somehow, I don't think
he's going to show.

1160
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:52,795
Don't move. You need a doctor.

1161
01:40:54,965 --> 01:40:56,632
You hear that, Trace?

1162
01:40:58,218 --> 01:40:59,594
We need a doctor.

1163
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:33,271
You okay?

1164
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:35,565
I will be.

1165
01:42:39,361 --> 01:42:40,903
You're supposed to put ice on that.

1166
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:43,781
I don't want any ice.

1167
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:46,701
You need ice.

1168
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:48,812
Fine.

1169
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:51,857
I'll have mine in a glass
with some scotch.

1170
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:53,040
Fine.

1171
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:55,751
Single malt. Nothing blended.

1172
01:42:56,044 --> 01:42:58,129
Blended whiskey is crap.

1173
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:01,257
Somebody told me that once.
