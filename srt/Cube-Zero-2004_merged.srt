1
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:16,687
I hate this place.

2
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:24,619
Water?

3
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:27,486
Water.

4
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:30,487
Water.

5
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:33,687
Water!

6
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:29,127
Now that is sick.

7
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:37,397
- Are you watching this?
- No, Thanks. I don't look any more.

8
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:56,124
We've seen a lot of...
But this is just...

9
00:04:57,247 --> 00:05:00,247
Oh, dear God!

10
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:03,086
Wow...

11
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:06,087
You know you shouldn't
be looking at the files.

12
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,487
- It's not against the rules.
- But it's not encouraged.

13
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:13,087
- Come on man, we've all...
- It's not encouraged.

14
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:20,847
Okay.

15
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:49,566
Okay, screw this.

16
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:53,276
- Pawn to King 2.
- Knight to Queen's Bishop 6.

17
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,807
- Check.
- What?

18
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:00,687
I didn't even see that.

19
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,563
I was just wondering...
When is Chickliss coming back?

20
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:15,197
Some time this week.
Probably all suntanned, the prick.

21
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:21,086
Let's see...

22
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:24,087
King to King's Bishop 8.

23
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:27,086
Rook takes Queen. Check.

24
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:30,087
Dammit.

25
00:08:30,447 --> 00:08:32,246
Damn!

26
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:35,247
- Sorry.
- Shut up I don't need your sympathy.

27
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:41,327
And Owen?

28
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:48,606
- Where is Owen?
- You're trying to psych me out or what?

29
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:51,607
I can't hear myself think.

30
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:56,486
Owen is...

31
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:59,797
Owen is probably out sick again.
That would be my best guess.

32
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:05,206
You sure?

33
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:08,207
Yes.

34
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:14,246
Yes!

35
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:18,320
Despite your rather transparent tactics,
Brainman, prepare to die.

36
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:22,567
Bishop to Queen's Knight 7.
Checkski!

37
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:26,358
Queen takes Bishop. I believe
that's Checkski-Mateski.

38
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,886
What? No way.

39
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:31,887
Ah come on, how did you...?

40
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:35,007
You freak of nature!

41
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:48,807
You know the other night I heard some noise.

42
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,446
- Noise?
- Yeah.

43
00:09:51,447 --> 00:09:54,447
In Owen's room, like a...
like a scuffle.

44
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,167
- Really?
- Yeah.

45
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,646
- You don't think that...?
- You dreamt it.

46
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:03,684
- No, look...
- You dreamt it.

47
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:07,487
You're always complaining
about your nightmares.

48
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:15,647
They come for you at night.

49
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:18,086
What?

50
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:21,087
- They come for you at night.
- Who does?

51
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:24,206
They do.

52
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,366
- Drop it.
- They do.

53
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,126
Enough!

54
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,127
What are you suicidal?

55
00:10:54,927 --> 00:10:57,927
Good. They didn't forget
lunch this time.

56
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,366
Goat cheese salad with ginseng,

57
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:08,155
liver fricasée
and mango sorbet. Eeewh.

58
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:13,047
Must be you.

59
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,978
Steak frites. That's me.

60
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:19,467
Hey!

61
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:22,468
Wha..?
Oh! Sorry.

62
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:26,646
Bless us our Lord for these thy gifts
which we're about to receive,

63
00:11:26,647 --> 00:11:29,326
from thy bounty through you, Lord.
Amen.

64
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:31,286
Amen.

65
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:34,287
Down the hatch.

66
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:47,402
"Please record REMsleeper
in room 17 24 09".

67
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:51,047
Let's go.

68
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:58,596
Okay.
Zooming out of 06, 12, 21.

69
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:03,758
And zooming in to 17, 24, 9.

70
00:12:04,927 --> 00:12:08,397
Here we go.
Hot-patching gear works

71
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,366
and flipping to
REM reader mode.

72
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:15,155
Locating subject.
Subject located.

73
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:18,807
Zooming in.

74
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:25,726
Wow...

75
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,886
Keep your tongue in your mouth, Brainman.
We're on the clock.

76
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:30,887
Are we locked?

77
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:33,887
Sorry. Locked on.

78
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:36,927
Thank you.
Arm extension, Go.

79
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:49,727
Calibrating...

80
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:53,607
- Steady.
- I got it, I got it.

81
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:57,967
Light her up.

82
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:05,441
Interscan is locked.
Commencing REM read.

83
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:33,847
Mommy!

84
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:36,326
Mommy Help!

85
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:39,206
Anna!

86
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:42,207
No! No!

87
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:17,207
Anna!

88
00:14:56,967 --> 00:15:00,846
Okay.
Now let's cycle back.

89
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,527
And there you have it.

90
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:09,719
If you do this long enough,
you can do it in your sleep.

91
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,606
In your sleep...

92
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:16,607
Recording dreams in your sleep.
That's funny.

93
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:20,407
When's the last time you
remember being outside?

94
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:24,086
Last night.
I had a dream of being at the beach.

95
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:27,363
No, I mean really outside,
not a dream.

96
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:33,846
I... I don't remember.

97
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:36,246
I've been busy lately.

98
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:39,364
Overloaded, actually.
Picking up slack.

99
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:42,527
For you, I might add.

100
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,847
I don't remember either.

101
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:49,247
- Isn't that weird?
- You're weird.

102
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:52,847
Shut up and let me concentrate.

103
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:55,006
Dammit!

104
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:58,007
- You know, I was just thinking...
- Stop thinking.

105
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:02,527
- What's gotten into you?
- What's gotten into me?

106
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:09,326
- You know who these are?
- They're Chickliss' kids.

107
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:13,400
- Arthur and Sunshine.
- Orphans. They're orphans.

108
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:23,527
You told me
Chickliss was on vacation.

109
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:26,927
I have to go to the can.

110
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:31,036
Try not to drool on the controls.
It screws up the calibration.

111
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:57,207
Bastards.

112
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:02,647
Where is she?

113
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:08,207
What have you done with her?

114
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:13,327
Where is...?

115
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:24,407
What have you done to me?

116
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:28,327
Why can't I remember?

117
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:31,367
Why can't I remember my
daughter's name?

118
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:07,138
Hey!

119
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:20,807
Let me go!

120
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:23,807
- Get off me!
- Okay. Okay. Sorry.

121
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,846
It's okay.

122
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:30,847
She's one of us.

123
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:34,446
Touch me again, soldier,
and you'll be eating your eyeballs.

124
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:36,526
Why soldier?
What do you know about me?

125
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:40,406
Tattoo, on you forehead.
You're on the squad, right killer?

126
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:43,727
You show up by night
and people disappear.

127
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:51,046
- Why did you do that?
- Because you're scum.

128
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:54,517
Look miss, you have a certain
disadvantage here.

129
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
None of us remembers how we got here,
or pretty much anything else.
Including who we are,
so whatever you think you know about me,

130
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,246
I don't even know myself.

131
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,046
I don't trust her. She knows something.

132
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:11,047
Thank God somebody does.

133
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,323
Have you seen any children?
A little girl?

134
00:20:19,407 --> 00:20:21,486
No.

135
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,487
My God. I hope they
don't put kids in here.

136
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:27,927
- That would be horrible.
- What if they drop children in here?

137
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,806
I gotta keep moving.

138
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:33,807
Wait! you gotta be
careful climbing around here.

139
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:36,847
- Why?
- There are traps.

140
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,527
Traps?
How do you know?

141
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:44,207
Because of this.

142
00:20:57,287 --> 00:21:00,563
That's good bandage.
Are you a doctor?

143
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,927
- I don't know.
- I did it.

144
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:07,237
I may be freakin' Mother Teresa for all I know,
But I don't remember.

145
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,486
You remember something.

146
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:13,487
Before all of this.

147
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:17,727
Not much.

148
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:21,356
Being chased through the woods,
by guys like you.

149
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:25,846
The tattoo set me off.

150
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:29,078
When I first woke up,
I don't think I would have known my own name

151
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,006
if it wasn't stitched on my shirt.

152
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:35,007
I don't even know if
this is my name.

153
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:38,962
I feel like we've been here for hours
and I still can't remember anything!

154
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:47,767
Give her a moment...

155
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:51,527
Fine. A moment.

156
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:54,486
We gotta get moving while
we still have our strength.

157
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:57,006
You guys have a plan?

158
00:21:57,007 --> 00:22:00,007
We keep moving in the same
direction until we find the edge.

159
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:03,846
This place has got to end eventually.

160
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:06,847
What about the traps?

161
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:09,887
We test the rooms.
We have a system.

162
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:25,647
It's safe!

163
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:32,607
I'm going in!

164
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:16,647
Help!

165
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:20,047
Help!

166
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:39,167
What kind of animals
would do this?!

167
00:23:57,407 --> 00:24:00,407
Does she look familiar to you?

168
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:05,887
I keep thinking I've seen her before...

169
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:11,807
- I wonder what she's in for.
- You're making a mistake.

170
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:14,606
Huh?

171
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:17,607
What the first rule
I taught you about this job?

172
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:20,724
- Neatness counts?
- Very funny.

173
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,886
Don't get involved.

174
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:27,163
I know, I'm not getting involved OK?
I'm drawing.

175
00:24:28,607 --> 00:24:31,607
You have your chess,
Owen has his fish, Chickliss...

176
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:35,606
Can we spend 5 minutes without
bringing up Owen and Chickliss please?

177
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:39,967
And get us back on real-time.
You're gonna get us in trouble.

178
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:56,364
I'll show you three ways to beat that game
if you answer one question.

179
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,517
- Fine. What?
- Okay, what I wanna know...

180
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:08,566
Hold it. Show me.

181
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:11,567
Okay.

182
00:25:41,647 --> 00:25:43,726
Check Mate.

183
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:46,727
You win.

184
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:52,206
That's brilliant.
Do that again.

185
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:55,207
- What do you know about a third exit?
- What?

186
00:25:55,247 --> 00:25:57,166
A third exit.

187
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:59,926
An auxiliary exit that leads
directly outside.

188
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:02,046
- There's no such thing.
- Owen said there was.

189
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:04,566
- He said Chickliss found more plans...
- They were having you on.

190
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:09,720
No way. I think that that's why they're gone.
I think they've found something...

191
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:11,926
I think you'd better stop
listening to old wives' tales.

192
00:26:11,927 --> 00:26:13,606
- Listen to me.
- This conversation in over.

193
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:16,607
- Don't you ever worry?
- About what?

194
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:20,287
One day, you're gonna wake up inside.

195
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:23,767
The only way I'm gonna wake up inside,
is if I keep on talking to you.

196
00:26:23,927 --> 00:26:26,927
No.

197
00:26:28,447 --> 00:26:31,006
These things are useless!

198
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:34,124
The sensors there must've been different.
Maybe they're not motion sensors.

199
00:26:34,287 --> 00:26:37,962
Maybe they're triggered by heat,
or sound, or something...!

200
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:40,326
Why don't you just admit it?
We're dead!

201
00:26:40,327 --> 00:26:43,327
He can't admit it.
It's the training.

202
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:47,164
- The army never admits defeat.
- You got a problem with me lady?

203
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:50,166
- Yeah.
- Why?

204
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:52,086
I don't trust you.

205
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:55,087
- Oh, how the hell did we miss this?
- What is it?

206
00:26:57,927 --> 00:27:00,246
C-I-A.

207
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:03,247
What is that?
Clues to who built this place?

208
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:07,597
I think that's just a coincidence.
Try the other doors.

209
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,286
Y-Y-O.

210
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:14,766
U-D-S.

211
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,046
S-A-N.

212
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:18,646
What do they mean?

213
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:21,647
I think it's a mistake to think of these
letters as meaning something.

214
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:26,926
It's like some kind of code
or puzzle we have to figure out.

215
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:29,726
A puzzle?
They're playing with us!

216
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:32,086
- We should make a map.
- Using what?

217
00:27:32,087 --> 00:27:33,526
- Our blood?
- I don't know.

218
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,246
Maybe.
You got a better idea?

219
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:39,247
I have a better idea.

220
00:27:40,047 --> 00:27:43,047
I need something. I need...

221
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:47,167
Your hair pin.

222
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:57,087
They did us the favour
of polishing our boots.

223
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:03,127
Okay,
We'll find the safe rooms.

224
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:06,247
C-I-A. Give me the others.

225
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,406
Y-Y-O, U-D-S

226
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:11,366
And S-A-N.

227
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:13,966
- Good memory.
- Yeah, in the short term.

228
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:17,118
Now I wish I could remember what happened
to me between birth and about 3 hours ago.

229
00:28:17,527 --> 00:28:20,206
Right.

230
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:22,646
I dunno...

231
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:25,647
Shoe polish and a hair pin.

232
00:28:26,727 --> 00:28:29,727
Nothing in this place is random.

233
00:28:29,847 --> 00:28:32,847
Maybe the bastards
just underestimated us.

234
00:28:50,447 --> 00:28:53,447
So near and yet so far.

235
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:57,126
Yeah, but she's doing better than most.

236
00:28:57,127 --> 00:29:00,517
I mean half of them don't even notice the letters,
Let alone map them.

237
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:05,087
I meant the chess.

238
00:29:09,927 --> 00:29:12,927
Give it up.
She doesn't stand a chance.

239
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:15,446
Of course she has a chance.

240
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:18,996
Yeah? You're gonna ride in on your
white horse and whisk her out?

241
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,726
The rooms can realign to zero position.

242
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:29,164
No it happens, and then she'll figure out
the letters and uhh... sail through.

243
00:29:29,327 --> 00:29:33,002
And what's the first thing the program
does when the rooms realign to zero position?

244
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:37,807
- Clean sweep.
- Exactly.

245
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:42,087
The only thing that's gonna sail
through that is their ashes.

246
00:29:44,887 --> 00:29:47,046
Cheer up buddy.
You'll catch you another one.

247
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:50,047
The boys upstairs like 'em
young and pretty.

248
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:56,207
Don't you ever feel guilty?

249
00:29:56,607 --> 00:29:59,917
- Don't you ever feel?
- Son, you're outta line.

250
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:04,166
- Yeah whatever...
- Excuse me?

251
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:07,167
Why don't you stop your doodling
and do some work for a change?

252
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:10,926
Like what?

253
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:14,681
We're waiting for orders, it's what we
do best. It's what we do.

254
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:18,447
Clean up your space.
It's disgraceful.

255
00:30:19,447 --> 00:30:22,564
- You're kidding, right?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

256
00:30:33,407 --> 00:30:36,407
This one's S-D-F.

257
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:39,246
Wait a minute.

258
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:42,247
- What?
- I don't know if this makes any difference,

259
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:45,247
But they're not periods,
They're commas.

260
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:54,366
He's right.
They're commas.

261
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:59,361
Okay, so they're commas.
What difference does it make?

262
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:03,487
We don't even know what
the letters mean yet.

263
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:06,846
I mean if they were numbers,
I'd understand the commas.

264
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:08,566
Understand the commas how?

265
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,766
Well isn't that how you plot
coordinates on a graph?

266
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:13,767
X coordinate, comma, Y coordinate,
comma, Z coordinate.

267
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:16,406
Right. So if the rooms were
labelled with numbers,

268
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:20,798
like "10,1,7", you'd know something
about the room's position.

269
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:24,317
Yeah but we've got letters that so
far tell us absolutely nothing.

270
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,966
That's where you're wrong, soldier.

271
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:30,967
The letters tell us one important
fact the number never would.

272
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:36,043
- What fact?
- There are only 26 letters in the English alphabet.

273
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:39,646
So?

274
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,886
So we know the parameters.

275
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:46,881
Exactly. If each room has its own
unique letter combination,

276
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:50,723
Then it's a pretty good bet
that this whole place is a cube

277
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:53,366
with 26 rooms on each side.

278
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:56,046
Worst case scenario,
we're anywhere from

279
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,286
1 to 25 rooms away from the edge.

280
00:31:58,287 --> 00:32:01,006
- Let's go!
- Great!

281
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:04,007
Actually, it's your turn to go first.

282
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:10,075
S-O-S. No kidding.

283
00:32:27,207 --> 00:32:30,207
Ahh.. Guess we'll try another way.

284
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:45,847
Rains, Rains,
Rains, Rains...

285
00:33:09,327 --> 00:33:12,327
Cassandra.

286
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:18,366
The little girl's name is Anna.

287
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:21,367
Protests and strikes.
Troublemakers up north.

288
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:24,806
The whole country's going to crap.

289
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:27,807
Ungrateful pigs.

290
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:32,006
Oh my God,
Oh my God...

291
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:33,686
What is it now?

292
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:36,687
Please tell me that's not...
Would you put that away?

293
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:38,406
There's no consent form.

294
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:41,407
- What?
- There is not pink page,
the consent form is missing!

295
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:44,886
- So?
- So?!

296
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:47,526
You know the rules. She can't
be in there without a consent form!

297
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:50,486
You think they're gonna stop this whole
operation because you lost a piece of paper?

298
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,366
I didn't lose it.

299
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:55,126
Look you know how
anal these guys are.

300
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:57,806
- Maybe she'll get another hearing.
- Listen to yourself!

301
00:33:57,807 --> 00:34:00,046
But this could be huge!
A mistrial!

302
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:03,047
- Oh sure, anything you say.
- Look...

303
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:08,727
See?
Told you I recognized her.

304
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:14,206
"Opposition Leaders
Stage Illegal Strike"

305
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:17,207
She's a political.
So that would explain it.

306
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:21,567
What do you mean?

307
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:26,164
I mean, there might
not be a consent form.

308
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:29,327
Get it?

309
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,886
But that's illegal.

310
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:35,163
You know for a child prodigy,
you ain't too bright.

311
00:34:37,607 --> 00:34:40,206
- We gotta do something.
- Like what?

312
00:34:40,207 --> 00:34:43,244
- We gotta let 'em know upstairs.
- And how are we gonna do that?

313
00:34:43,887 --> 00:34:46,887
Call up.

314
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,959
- It's just for emergencies.
- Well what do you think this is?

315
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,646
I don't see a fire.

316
00:34:54,647 --> 00:34:56,686
I don't see a gas leak,
or flooding.

317
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:59,286
I don't see you writhing on the floor
in the throws of a heart attack

318
00:34:59,287 --> 00:35:01,206
But God knows
right now I'd like to!

319
00:35:01,207 --> 00:35:04,207
She's gonna die in there
and she's probably innocent!

320
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:06,166
None of them are innocent!

321
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,566
You read the files. You know what
kind of people end up in there!

322
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:11,567
Exactly! All we know is
what we read in the files...

323
00:35:14,727 --> 00:35:17,046
Oh my God...

324
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:19,766
What if it's all bogus?
The files, the crimes, everything.

325
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:22,767
Maybe they're just putting anyone
in there they don't like, maybe...

326
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:25,006
There's a purpose, and there's a plan.

327
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:28,841
And I'm not so stupid to think that there's
no plan just because I don't understand it!

328
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:31,926
Here's a newsflash:
We're just the button men!

329
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:34,726
If we're meant to be analysts,
we'd be working upstairs!

330
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:38,276
Would you forget the party line
for once and make the call?

331
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:44,447
Okay.

332
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:47,687
You do it.
You're the hero.

333
00:35:53,247 --> 00:35:54,966
Just remember,

334
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:57,686
She was in the news and
they made her disappear.

335
00:35:57,687 --> 00:36:00,687
How much easier would it be to get to you.

336
00:36:01,807 --> 00:36:04,807
No one even know you exist.

337
00:36:05,647 --> 00:36:08,647
Who knows where you'll
wake up tomorrow?

338
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:26,127
Hello?

339
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:31,327
It's for you.

340
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:38,326
Yeah?

341
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:40,206
Sir.

342
00:36:40,207 --> 00:36:42,846
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

343
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:45,246
Yes, sir.

344
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:48,247
I understand, sir. Yes, sir.

345
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:56,447
We've got work to do.
Someone's at the exit.

346
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:00,486
Our exit?
What do we do?

347
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:03,487
The exit procedure.

348
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:07,167
Wait a minute. I've never done this before.
Don't you usually do this with Owen?

349
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:10,637
That's right my friend,
but Owen is not here, is he?

350
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:13,847
And the rules clearly state

351
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:17,723
that two senior technicians
have to be present

352
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:20,766
at all exit procedures.

353
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:22,646
Right, but I'm not a senior technician.

354
00:37:22,647 --> 00:37:26,117
Hey! I need help here.
That was a phone call from upstairs.

355
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:29,757
Personal contact. Direct orders from above.
They never do that.

356
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:33,007
We can't screw this up.

357
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:39,167
- We?
- Yes. We.

358
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:46,327
As far as I understand, sir,

359
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:50,244
only senior techs are allowed to
perform the exit procedure.

360
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:53,444
Perhaps it would be my be
interest to abstain until receiving

361
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:56,607
clearance from higher up.

362
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:03,407
You little prick.

363
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:06,566
Okay.

364
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:08,926
Okay, I get it.

365
00:38:08,927 --> 00:38:13,159
Look, you help me with this,
I'll tell them about your girlfriend. Okay?

366
00:38:13,687 --> 00:38:16,687
- When?
- What?

367
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,927
When will you let them know?

368
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:22,927
As soon as we're done
with this. All right?

369
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:27,726
Okay.

370
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:30,566
- What do I do?
- Just follow my lead.

371
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:33,567
Okay, here we go. Step one,

372
00:38:33,887 --> 00:38:36,887
Visual confirmation of
subject in exit room.

373
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:54,006
Oh, no. Owen.

374
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:57,007
- It's Owen.
- Shut up.

375
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:52,287
Hello?

376
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,967
Hello?

377
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:03,687
Hello?

378
00:40:37,287 --> 00:40:40,287
Hello!

379
00:40:43,687 --> 00:40:45,966
Anyone there?

380
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:48,967
Hello?

381
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:51,806
What now?

382
00:40:51,807 --> 00:40:54,406
Please!

383
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:57,407
Question one.
Please state your name.

384
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,046
Huh?

385
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:03,047
Who are you?

386
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:06,956
He doesn't recognise your voice.
They fried his brain.

387
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:09,526
Please state your name.

388
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:12,527
- They fried his brain like the rest.
- Shut up!

389
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:19,727
I think it's Owen.

390
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:23,207
Thank you.

391
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:27,486
Question two:

392
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:30,487
Do you believe in God?

393
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:32,206
What?

394
00:41:32,207 --> 00:41:33,366
What?

395
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:36,367
Question two:
Do you believe in God?

396
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:40,727
What is this?
Screw you!

397
00:41:41,887 --> 00:41:44,887
Please answer Yes or No.

398
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:48,886
What kind of god would
do this to people?

399
00:41:48,887 --> 00:41:51,887
Please answer Yes or No.

400
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:56,006
No.

401
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:57,526
Okay?

402
00:41:57,527 --> 00:41:59,366
No!

403
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:02,367
Now let me go.
Let me go!

404
00:42:03,207 --> 00:42:06,207
God dammit.
Let me out of here!

405
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:09,646
Hit it.

406
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:10,966
I need a doctor.

407
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:13,766
- What does it do?
- Just hit it.

408
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:16,446
Please!

409
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,447
For Christ's sake!

410
00:42:51,287 --> 00:42:54,287
Still want your girlfriend to
sail through to the exit?

411
00:43:00,727 --> 00:43:03,406
He...

412
00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:06,407
He's gone. It's over.

413
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:22,966
- He was one of us.
- No.

414
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,967
Once inside, he's one of them.

415
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:37,447
So this is your big exit procedure?

416
00:43:40,127 --> 00:43:43,127
What are we doing here?

417
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:47,567
"Do you believe in God?"
It all hinges on that?

418
00:43:49,007 --> 00:43:52,397
I just read the questions
and push the buttons, okay?

419
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:02,927
What happens if you push Yes?

420
00:44:02,967 --> 00:44:05,246
I don't know.

421
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,247
No one's ever said Yes.

422
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:16,166
Here.

423
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:19,167
Send this upstairs.

424
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:25,367
Do it!

425
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:03,647
Do you believe in God?

426
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:23,167
What kind of animals would do this?

427
00:45:45,207 --> 00:45:48,438
Owen is...
Owen is probably out sick again.

428
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:52,007
- You sure?
- Yes.

429
00:45:57,847 --> 00:46:00,847
What are you doing?
You're not allowed in there.

430
00:46:04,647 --> 00:46:07,406
I'm through pushing buttons.

431
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:10,407
No!

432
00:46:13,127 --> 00:46:16,127
Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!

433
00:47:49,807 --> 00:47:52,807
I'm inside.

434
00:47:54,127 --> 00:47:57,127
Okay...

435
00:48:32,487 --> 00:48:35,487
Thank God.

436
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:43,487
You stupid jackass!

437
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:52,327
Good evening, Mr. Dodd.

438
00:48:54,247 --> 00:48:57,247
I believe these belong to you.

439
00:48:59,127 --> 00:49:03,325
Well, it looks that you got yourself a
little bit of a situation down here.

440
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:07,367
May we?

441
00:49:08,767 --> 00:49:11,767
The boys upstairs felt
you could perhaps use a hand,

442
00:49:11,887 --> 00:49:14,086
and so, here we are.

443
00:49:14,087 --> 00:49:18,365
My name is Jax and these are my
associates Mr. Finn and Mr. Quigley.

444
00:49:19,287 --> 00:49:20,806
Right.

445
00:49:20,807 --> 00:49:23,807
Gentleman, first things first,
we locate our mouse.

446
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:28,198
He has no implant and so we have to
do this the old fashioned way, I'm afraid.

447
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:31,367
Mr. Quigley, run a visual check on
all rooms, he couldn't have got far.

448
00:49:31,527 --> 00:49:32,686
Yes, Sir.

449
00:49:32,687 --> 00:49:36,202
Mr. Finn, run a probability tree
on his potential movements.

450
00:49:36,447 --> 00:49:39,447
- Let's have some contingency, shall we.
- Right away, Sir.

451
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,647
Excuse me, Mr. Jax.

452
00:50:21,327 --> 00:50:24,327
Excuse me, sir.

453
00:50:26,367 --> 00:50:29,367
Yes Mr. Codd?

454
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:32,446
It's Dodd, sir.

455
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:35,447
What do I do?

456
00:50:35,887 --> 00:50:37,646
- I'm sorry?
- What do...?

457
00:50:37,647 --> 00:50:41,083
Yes I almost forgot I have
your orders from upstairs.

458
00:50:42,007 --> 00:50:45,007
It's a personal delivery.

459
00:50:47,407 --> 00:50:49,966
"Order number 7-9-3,
bla, bla, bla, bla... "

460
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:53,801
"Commence standard series
of needle tests on Rains group. "

461
00:50:58,807 --> 00:51:01,807
- You do know what that means?
- Yes, sir.

462
00:51:02,887 --> 00:51:04,366
Of course, sir.

463
00:51:04,367 --> 00:51:07,367
All in a day's work, sir.
Right away, sir.

464
00:51:07,927 --> 00:51:10,927
Do us a tinsy favour and use
Mr. Wynn's auxiliary monitor.

465
00:51:11,087 --> 00:51:14,006
We'll need the big guns here
for our little mouse hunt.

466
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:16,686
Of course, Sir.
Anything I can do to help, sir...

467
00:51:16,687 --> 00:51:19,526
That the spirit Mr. Modd, way to
keep the world safe for democracy.

468
00:51:19,527 --> 00:51:22,527
- Have we got a visual yet?
- Still working on it, Sir.

469
00:51:28,927 --> 00:51:32,442
Okay, K-G-K.
Three odds.

470
00:51:32,607 --> 00:51:35,607
M-A-Q.
Three odds.

471
00:51:35,687 --> 00:51:39,236
Safe.
Like taking candy from a baby.

472
00:51:44,247 --> 00:51:47,126
A-Z-Z. A-Z-Z!

473
00:51:47,127 --> 00:51:50,127
Got it.

474
00:51:56,687 --> 00:51:59,687
I don't know why we bother
with these things anymore.

475
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:03,046
A-Z-Z.

476
00:52:03,047 --> 00:52:04,886
It's the first time I've seen a Z.

477
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:07,887
- Do you think it means anything?
- I don't know.

478
00:52:08,887 --> 00:52:11,887
Ah, don't let the door close!

479
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:15,127
Dammit!

480
00:52:26,007 --> 00:52:29,007
She's gone.

481
00:52:48,287 --> 00:52:50,046
Got it.

482
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,047
Subject is isolated.

483
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:12,247
And now the tricky part.

484
00:54:10,567 --> 00:54:13,567
Okay. You were last seen here.

485
00:54:15,007 --> 00:54:17,526
That was an hour ago.

486
00:54:17,527 --> 00:54:20,527
She should still be in the same coordinate.

487
00:54:43,127 --> 00:54:46,086
The rooms move.
Do they have to?

488
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:48,841
She can't be that far.

489
00:54:49,007 --> 00:54:52,363
Yeah but if we veer too far off course
looking for her we'll never find the edge.

490
00:54:52,527 --> 00:54:55,246
What do you suggest, killer?
That we'll cut our loses?

491
00:54:55,247 --> 00:54:58,247
Uh, Guys.

492
00:55:00,087 --> 00:55:03,087
Are we sure this room is safe?

493
00:55:07,727 --> 00:55:12,198
Maybe he just starved to death.
God I'm hungry.

494
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:22,127
- What are you doing?
- We could use these.

495
00:55:22,247 --> 00:55:25,398
- We have to keep moving.
- We have to get back on track.

496
00:55:25,567 --> 00:55:28,718
We've already chased our tails
for an hour looking for her.

497
00:55:28,887 --> 00:55:31,166
God! This headache is not going away...

498
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:34,167
- Maybe it's that chip in your head.
- What?

499
00:55:35,407 --> 00:55:40,117
It's true isn't it? I mean they now put
bio-receivers in all you army boys.

500
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:43,206
Keeps you on a leash.

501
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:46,207
Lady you've got a hell of an imagination.

502
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:49,847
Jackpot. It's her.

503
00:55:51,767 --> 00:55:52,966
Dammit.

504
00:55:52,967 --> 00:55:55,846
Is she all right?

505
00:55:55,847 --> 00:55:57,926
She's not moving.

506
00:55:57,927 --> 00:56:00,927
Great.

507
00:56:08,087 --> 00:56:11,087
Wake up.

508
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:14,367
Are you all right?

509
00:56:14,647 --> 00:56:17,006
Rise and shine...

510
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:20,007
Is she...?

511
00:56:21,327 --> 00:56:23,926
There's a pulse.

512
00:56:23,927 --> 00:56:25,646
She's burning up.

513
00:56:25,647 --> 00:56:28,647
Can you hear me?

514
00:56:29,727 --> 00:56:32,246
- Oh my God.
- What happened to you?

515
00:56:32,247 --> 00:56:35,247
Help...

516
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:42,246
I need a doctor.

517
00:56:42,247 --> 00:56:44,566
- Don't let her touch you!
- Let go!

518
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,286
- Watch it!
- Oh my God!

519
00:56:46,287 --> 00:56:49,287
Don't leave me!

520
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,647
- You just...
- I didn't mean to...

521
00:57:03,767 --> 00:57:06,767
She scratched and I...

522
00:57:07,647 --> 00:57:10,647
You put her out of her misery.

523
00:57:11,207 --> 00:57:14,207
My headache's gone.

524
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:19,607
Something's eating her.

525
00:57:20,567 --> 00:57:23,206
A chemical or a virus.

526
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:25,966
We never checked this room for traps.

527
00:57:25,967 --> 00:57:28,967
I could be in the air.

528
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:32,087
- Let's see your arm.
- We've got to get outta here.

529
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,407
- Show me your arm.
- He's right, we've gotta get outta here.

530
00:57:35,447 --> 00:57:37,966
Your arm. Where she scratched you,
Let's see it.

531
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:39,486
- Why, you think...?
- Yes, I think!

532
00:57:39,487 --> 00:57:42,487
Fine! there, see?
Nothing!

533
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:46,127
Flesh wound.

534
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,606
Sure.

535
00:57:55,607 --> 00:57:58,086
Nothing.

536
00:57:58,087 --> 00:58:00,246
What do we do with him?

537
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:01,606
What do you mean?

538
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:04,046
I think whatever was eating away
at her, is spreading to him.

539
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:07,047
- Hey I'm still here!
- Not for long!

540
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,566
- I say we ditch him.
- Screw you!

541
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:13,567
Just relax guys,
nobody's ditching anyone.

542
00:58:14,087 --> 00:58:16,766
Look at him.

543
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:18,726
Oh my God.

544
00:58:18,727 --> 00:58:20,166
What?

545
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:23,167
Your face.

546
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:30,207
Crap.

547
00:58:38,247 --> 00:58:41,166
Please don't leave me.

548
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:42,646
This is horrible.

549
00:58:42,647 --> 00:58:45,006
You wanna baby-sit a dead man?
Be my guest.

550
00:58:45,007 --> 00:58:48,007
Please. I'll do anything.

551
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,567
Anything?

552
00:58:52,607 --> 00:58:55,607
From now on,
you test the rooms.

553
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:59,407
All of them.

554
00:59:01,647 --> 00:59:04,647
Fine.

555
00:59:12,407 --> 00:59:15,407
Well, we're not going down there.

556
00:59:15,567 --> 00:59:18,567
No sense wasting a good boot.

557
00:59:32,887 --> 00:59:35,086
Help me!

558
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:38,087
He's still alive down there!

559
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:41,407
Forget it, he's gone.

560
00:59:41,647 --> 00:59:44,647
You heartless son of a bitch!

561
01:00:19,207 --> 01:00:22,207
No!

562
01:00:26,607 --> 01:00:29,086
- Don't come near me.
- I was protecting us.

563
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:32,318
- You murdered him.
- He was infected.

564
01:00:32,487 --> 01:00:35,763
You saw it, it was spreading.
We'd be dead by now.

565
01:00:35,927 --> 01:00:39,317
- You don't know that.
- Actually, he's right.

566
01:00:39,847 --> 01:00:42,847
It's a highly contagious form of a virus.

567
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:46,167
- Flesh eating disease.
- Who the hell are you?

568
01:00:47,527 --> 01:00:51,520
I...
I've come to help.

569
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:55,527
- Damn.
- Problem, Mr. Scrod?

570
01:00:55,647 --> 01:00:58,606
- No problem Sir.
- Anything of interest?

571
01:00:58,607 --> 01:01:00,646
Actually Sir, I was about to...

572
01:01:00,647 --> 01:01:03,647
Would you care to share
with the rest of the class?

573
01:01:04,207 --> 01:01:05,886
Yes Sir.

574
01:01:05,887 --> 01:01:09,038
As I was running my test series
as instructed Sir,

575
01:01:09,847 --> 01:01:12,847
The query intersected with my subject, Sir.

576
01:01:13,007 --> 01:01:14,806
Good work, Rod.

577
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:17,807
Who says they only hire the mentally
challenged down here?

578
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:20,566
Open.

579
01:01:20,567 --> 01:01:23,567
- Thank you, Sir.
- Up on the main monitor now, Please.

580
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:28,720
We keep... They, collect data and run tests.

581
01:01:28,887 --> 01:01:32,163
All kinds of tests. Testing
Chemical and Biological agents,

582
01:01:32,407 --> 01:01:35,604
Measure brain activity, endurance,
most of it I don't even understand.

583
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:39,086
And that's just what
I see in my department.

584
01:01:39,087 --> 01:01:42,087
I hear about others who
do different work.

585
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:46,007
I even heard there
are other facilities.

586
01:01:46,847 --> 01:01:48,566
Cubes.

587
01:01:48,567 --> 01:01:50,486
Christ.

588
01:01:50,487 --> 01:01:52,406
I just heard rumours.

589
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:54,486
- Why can't we remember anything?
- I don't know,

590
01:01:54,487 --> 01:01:57,763
I always assumed that it was so they
could have a blank slate to work with.

591
01:01:57,927 --> 01:02:01,556
Blank slate?  Bastards,
you've been using us as lab rats.

592
01:02:01,887 --> 01:02:04,446
Hey man, not me.

593
01:02:04,447 --> 01:02:06,486
I'm just the computer guy,
system checks. Stuff like that.

594
01:02:06,487 --> 01:02:09,487
Oh yeah, you just followed orders.

595
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:12,406
Yeah.

596
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:15,407
- You make me sick.
- Look, you got it all wrong.

597
01:02:15,647 --> 01:02:17,726
- I hate my job.
- You're job?

598
01:02:17,727 --> 01:02:20,246
How can you do this to people.

599
01:02:20,247 --> 01:02:22,766
It was your choice.

600
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:25,767
You volunteered, only you
don't remember anymore.

601
01:02:25,847 --> 01:02:28,246
At least that what they told us.

602
01:02:28,247 --> 01:02:30,206
And you believed them?

603
01:02:30,207 --> 01:02:33,517
Well, yeah. I saw the consent forms.
Except for yours!

604
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,486
You're lying!

605
01:02:35,487 --> 01:02:38,487
Who would volunteer for this?

606
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:40,686
Well it was either this
or execution so...

607
01:02:40,687 --> 01:02:43,126
What?

608
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:45,086
They say you're all condemned prisoners,

609
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:48,087
who volunteer for the experiment
instead of facing the death penalty.

610
01:02:48,967 --> 01:02:51,286
I never did anything to deserve this.

611
01:02:51,287 --> 01:02:54,287
Yeah well, tell it to Meyerhold, Right?

612
01:02:59,807 --> 01:03:03,197
- We're innocent, dammit!
- I didn't volunteer for this!

613
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:05,846
I know, because your
consent form is missing!

614
01:03:05,847 --> 01:03:07,366
Shut up!

615
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:10,367
While you were doing your system checks,

616
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:13,567
did you happen to see a little girl?

617
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:15,926
No. Yes.

618
01:03:15,927 --> 01:03:18,886
I mean, I saw her.

619
01:03:18,887 --> 01:03:21,887
I saw one little girl...

620
01:03:22,847 --> 01:03:24,806
In your dreams.

621
01:03:24,807 --> 01:03:27,046
- What?
- Yeah.

622
01:03:27,047 --> 01:03:29,126
It's hard to explain.

623
01:03:29,127 --> 01:03:32,127
Here.

624
01:03:32,367 --> 01:03:35,439
You see, another thing they have us
do, is record the subject's,

625
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:38,607
the people's dreams.

626
01:03:39,207 --> 01:03:42,207
Her name's Anna, Right?

627
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:51,767
- They can see into our dreams?
- Yeah.

628
01:03:52,407 --> 01:03:54,886
Where is my daughter, you piece of shit?!

629
01:03:54,887 --> 01:03:56,406
- I don't know!
- You're lying!

630
01:03:56,407 --> 01:03:58,406
No, Please!
I came to help!

631
01:03:58,407 --> 01:04:01,407
Rains!

632
01:04:01,607 --> 01:04:03,046
We need him.

633
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:06,047
- Why?
- I can show you the exits.

634
01:04:06,207 --> 01:04:09,207
Go ahead, where are they?

635
01:04:10,367 --> 01:04:12,326
You were wrong about the cube.

636
01:04:12,327 --> 01:04:15,327
It's only 25 rooms all around.

637
01:04:15,447 --> 01:04:18,447
Only 2 rooms have Z coordinates valued 26.

638
01:04:19,207 --> 01:04:22,207
They periodically move to the perimeter,

639
01:04:22,447 --> 01:04:25,447
but those 2 exit points are monitored.

640
01:04:25,647 --> 01:04:28,798
And there's supposed
to be an auxiliary exit.

641
01:04:28,967 --> 01:04:31,366
That leads directly outside the cube.

642
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,766
How do we get to that one?

643
01:04:33,767 --> 01:04:35,126
I don't know.

644
01:04:35,127 --> 01:04:38,127
So what use is he?

645
01:04:38,927 --> 01:04:42,124
- Can you show us how to avoid the traps?
- Yes, definitely.

646
01:04:43,287 --> 01:04:45,406
Okay.

647
01:04:45,407 --> 01:04:48,797
Just read me the coordinates
from the surrounding rooms, please.

648
01:04:51,527 --> 01:04:54,527
I was right.
The coordinates.

649
01:04:56,207 --> 01:04:58,526
Well, well...

650
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:02,918
It seems that our little mouse,
is a rat after all.

651
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:08,367
Mr. Finn, could you do
something about that, please?

652
01:05:08,687 --> 01:05:11,687
Yes, Sir.

653
01:05:17,927 --> 01:05:20,927
This one's C-F-P.

654
01:05:21,767 --> 01:05:24,767
The hell...?

655
01:05:28,647 --> 01:05:30,326
- Damn.
- What is it?

656
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:33,327
- The letters. They just disappeared.
- What?

657
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,767
They're all gone.

658
01:05:44,767 --> 01:05:46,766
They know I'm here.

659
01:05:46,767 --> 01:05:50,396
- So now will be a good time to move.
- Good idea. You first.

660
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:54,206
Okay.

661
01:05:54,207 --> 01:05:57,207
I can't make any promises,
but this should be the way.

662
01:05:58,047 --> 01:06:01,562
Mr. Quigley, could you isolate
that quadrant for me please?

663
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:08,556
Mr. Finn, show me the current trap
configuration, "s'il vous plait".

664
01:06:22,007 --> 01:06:25,007
"Merci".

665
01:06:25,887 --> 01:06:29,562
Let's make their life a little
more interesting, shall we?

666
01:06:49,887 --> 01:06:52,887
Okay...

667
01:06:54,007 --> 01:06:57,317
Trapped. Sure looked easy from my desk.

668
01:07:24,767 --> 01:07:27,446
They trapped all the rooms around us.
Now what?

669
01:07:27,447 --> 01:07:30,447
Really glad you
showed up to help.

670
01:07:34,127 --> 01:07:37,403
My God. I'm actually
starting to enjoy myself.

671
01:07:38,247 --> 01:07:41,842
You know what? I think we should keep
getting together and doing this more often.

672
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:54,447
God dammit.

673
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,806
What?

674
01:07:56,807 --> 01:07:59,006
Sir.

675
01:07:59,007 --> 01:08:01,526
Yes, Sir.

676
01:08:01,527 --> 01:08:04,406
Yes, Sir.

677
01:08:04,407 --> 01:08:07,366
Sorry, Sir.

678
01:08:07,367 --> 01:08:10,326
Right away, Sir.

679
01:08:10,327 --> 01:08:13,327
"Just finish it, you idiot."

680
01:08:13,367 --> 01:08:15,006
Ungrateful cretins.

681
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,006
You didn't hear that.

682
01:08:17,007 --> 01:08:21,080
Okay gentleman, we have
the word from on high.

683
01:08:21,527 --> 01:08:23,406
It's time to blow this popsicle stand.

684
01:08:23,407 --> 01:08:25,086
- Mr. Quigley.
- Sir?

685
01:08:25,087 --> 01:08:27,686
You heard the man.
Just finish it.

686
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:30,687
Yes Sir.

687
01:08:33,967 --> 01:08:36,967
Okay, let me think,
let me think.

688
01:08:39,447 --> 01:08:42,447
What the... ?

689
01:08:55,807 --> 01:08:58,166
Now what do we do?

690
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:01,167
The floor. the floor.

691
01:09:02,607 --> 01:09:05,607
I'm sorry.

692
01:09:07,887 --> 01:09:10,887
God dammit!
I don't wanna die in here!

693
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:24,167
What's happening?

694
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:30,846
What stopped it?

695
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:33,847
I don't know.

696
01:09:41,087 --> 01:09:44,087
Come on, you piece of...

697
01:09:47,607 --> 01:09:50,607
- What the hell?
- I don't know Sir, we suddenly lost contact.

698
01:09:52,407 --> 01:09:55,407
Yes, I can see that. Why?

699
01:09:55,407 --> 01:09:58,717
Maybe the energy required for
the test itself blew out the capacitor.

700
01:09:58,887 --> 01:10:01,206
I mean, we're not talking
state-of-the-art equipment.

701
01:10:01,207 --> 01:10:04,961
Wrong. That's not how it works.
That's not how it was designed.

702
01:10:05,847 --> 01:10:08,486
Someone is screwing with the connection.

703
01:10:08,487 --> 01:10:10,926
I don't know Sir.
It isn't me.

704
01:10:10,927 --> 01:10:13,927
Me neither, Sir.

705
01:10:18,607 --> 01:10:21,607
What?
I have no idea.

706
01:10:22,247 --> 01:10:25,247
It's not me, I swear.

707
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:34,283
You wouldn't lie to me,
Now would you Mr. Clodd?

708
01:10:36,367 --> 01:10:39,367
No Sir. Wouldn't think of it.

709
01:10:47,287 --> 01:10:50,206
Questions? Comments?
What are we waiting for?

710
01:10:50,207 --> 01:10:53,207
Get us back online!

711
01:11:11,607 --> 01:11:13,486
Damn.

712
01:11:13,487 --> 01:11:16,487
- Nothing.
- "Nothing" is not an answer.

713
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,526
Excuse me, Sir.

714
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:24,527
- Excuse me?
- What is it?

715
01:11:25,127 --> 01:11:28,127
Can I use the facilities, Sir?

716
01:11:29,727 --> 01:11:31,406
Just go!

717
01:11:31,407 --> 01:11:34,407
For the love of God,
where do they find these people?

718
01:11:36,207 --> 01:11:38,126
I don't think it's software, Sir.

719
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,324
- It's definitely a hardware problem.
- Listen.

720
01:11:41,527 --> 01:11:44,046
This is getting embarrassing now. Okay?

721
01:11:44,047 --> 01:11:46,326
I needn't remind you Gentlemen,
that in a few minutes

722
01:11:46,327 --> 01:11:49,166
we'll have no choice but
to send people in there.

723
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:52,716
Call me impulsive but I could probably
think of a couple of names:

724
01:11:52,887 --> 01:11:54,766
Quigley! Finn!

725
01:11:54,767 --> 01:11:57,767
You know, right of the top.
What is that noise?!

726
01:11:57,847 --> 01:11:59,486
Something's wrong with the main power source.

727
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,487
It's gone into reset mode.

728
01:12:04,647 --> 01:12:07,647
What the hell is going on?

729
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:10,967
Boot.

730
01:12:31,327 --> 01:12:34,327
- Damn.
- You can say that again.

731
01:12:34,567 --> 01:12:36,806
What?

732
01:12:36,807 --> 01:12:39,006
Power go out?

733
01:12:39,007 --> 01:12:40,406
Yeah.

734
01:12:40,407 --> 01:12:43,407
So the traps don't work.

735
01:12:44,247 --> 01:12:47,247
- That's the good news, yeah.
- What's the bad news?

736
01:12:49,127 --> 01:12:52,127
It's gone into reset mode.

737
01:12:53,047 --> 01:12:55,886
The system will restart
itself in 10 minutes,

738
01:12:55,887 --> 01:12:59,436
the first routine that runs
on restart, is a clean sweep.

739
01:13:00,207 --> 01:13:03,404
- Is that as bad as it sounds?
- The Clean sweep program flash-incinerates

740
01:13:03,567 --> 01:13:05,646
anything still living in all the rooms.

741
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:08,684
- So, we gotta move.
- Which way do we go?

742
01:13:09,727 --> 01:13:10,966
I don't know.

743
01:13:10,967 --> 01:13:13,686
Okay, last time I ran the numbers you were

744
01:13:13,687 --> 01:13:15,806
pretty much in the centre of the structure.

745
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:19,356
So I guess we just keep going in the same direction

746
01:13:19,527 --> 01:13:21,646
until we get to the edge, right?

747
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,246
Great, so we're back to square one!

748
01:13:23,247 --> 01:13:25,326
- Do you have a better idea?!
- No.

749
01:13:25,327 --> 01:13:28,444
I don't. 'Cause I'm not the one who uses
people as a fucking guinea pigs!

750
01:13:29,407 --> 01:13:31,126
Wait!

751
01:13:31,127 --> 01:13:33,446
Back to square one!

752
01:13:33,447 --> 01:13:36,803
Dodd. Dodd is the only one who
can power down this quickly.

753
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:41,724
But he knows that reset would
kick in, so why would he...?

754
01:13:44,247 --> 01:13:47,086
Of course.

755
01:13:47,087 --> 01:13:50,238
Clean sweep happens after
they realign to zero position.

756
01:13:50,407 --> 01:13:53,407
- What?
- Quick. Let me see your map.

757
01:13:55,087 --> 01:13:56,726
When the power comes
on, the rooms are programmed

758
01:13:56,727 --> 01:14:00,037
to realign back to their original positions
before the clean sweep starts.

759
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:03,279
now, if we're in one of
the exit room, Like A-Z-Z,

760
01:14:03,447 --> 01:14:05,566
it will move us to the perimeter, and

761
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:08,366
we'll have about... 3 seconds to get out.

762
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:11,367
- Before it fries us.
- Yeah.

763
01:14:13,807 --> 01:14:17,356
If that room hasn't moved,
we'd might just make it. Yeah.

764
01:14:21,407 --> 01:14:25,400
You know Mr. Wod has been in the
little boy's room an awfully long time.

765
01:14:33,407 --> 01:14:36,407
Come on.

766
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:40,807
Gotcha

767
01:14:40,967 --> 01:14:45,757
A noble attempt to save
your protégé, Mr. Dodd.

768
01:14:47,807 --> 01:14:50,646
But quite foolish, ultimately.

769
01:14:50,647 --> 01:14:53,647
May I have that widget back, please?

770
01:14:54,607 --> 01:14:57,607
I don't think I can do that, Sir.

771
01:15:00,007 --> 01:15:03,363
Mr. Dodd, are you
disobeying a direct order?

772
01:15:07,287 --> 01:15:10,287
Yes. There...

773
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:22,766
Cute, and rather, cliché,

774
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:25,246
in an endearing kind of way.

775
01:15:25,247 --> 01:15:29,035
Unfortunately, I do believe there is penalty,

776
01:15:30,047 --> 01:15:32,326
a rather strict penalty,

777
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:35,327
for sabotaging state property.

778
01:15:39,887 --> 01:15:42,887
Instant paralysis! They
weren't kidding, were they.

779
01:15:43,087 --> 01:15:46,087
However, not to worry,
Mr. Dodd,

780
01:15:48,927 --> 01:15:51,927
You still will be able to feel.

781
01:15:59,807 --> 01:16:02,807
5 minutes to reset.

782
01:16:03,407 --> 01:16:06,407
I think I found the source of our
power problem.

783
01:16:06,487 --> 01:16:09,086
Does anyone knows where this goes?

784
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,766
Anyone?

785
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:13,767
That the central coupling.
I got it, Sir.

786
01:16:15,247 --> 01:16:19,525
Still doesn't solve our observation problem,
they could be escaping as we speak.

787
01:16:19,687 --> 01:16:22,446
Sir, in less then 5 minutes from
now the clean sweep kicks in,

788
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:24,686
and then I think our problem will evaporate.

789
01:16:24,687 --> 01:16:27,687
Mr. Finn, I don't trust machines.

790
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:31,716
I have a machine to
thank for this, and this.

791
01:16:32,007 --> 01:16:35,477
I need to see them, with
my own God-given eye.

792
01:16:35,647 --> 01:16:38,647
Of course Sir, I just, I don't know how...

793
01:16:40,927 --> 01:16:42,966
Sometimes I even amaze myself.

794
01:16:42,967 --> 01:16:47,563
Mr. Finn, one of our runaway rats
is a former squad soldier. Is he not?

795
01:16:47,727 --> 01:16:49,686
Yes Sir, that would be
Haskell, the big fellow.

796
01:16:49,687 --> 01:16:53,919
And they still bio-chip the enlisted men,
do they not?

797
01:16:54,887 --> 01:16:57,887
Of course. Sir, that's brilliant...

798
01:17:00,887 --> 01:17:02,486
Mr. Quigley comes through.

799
01:17:02,487 --> 01:17:06,400
Mr. Finn, acquire us an uplink to
the squad surveillance network.

800
01:17:06,847 --> 01:17:09,847
Yes Sir. Right away, Sir.

801
01:17:17,807 --> 01:17:20,807
- Time?
- We still have 4 minutes!

802
01:17:28,287 --> 01:17:31,287
Hold on!

803
01:17:39,847 --> 01:17:42,847
There's no way he survived that.

804
01:17:47,367 --> 01:17:50,367
We gotta go. Come on.

805
01:18:01,687 --> 01:18:04,884
- We're locked on.
- Sir, we have a visual.

806
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:08,047
It's a weak signal.

807
01:18:08,087 --> 01:18:11,006
Your tax dollars hard at work.

808
01:18:11,007 --> 01:18:14,007
Transmit the kill code.

809
01:18:15,527 --> 01:18:18,286
Pain inhibiters, activated.

810
01:18:18,287 --> 01:18:21,287
Neuro-cam enhancers, amplified.

811
01:18:30,047 --> 01:18:33,047
- Are we there yet?
- Almost.

812
01:18:39,287 --> 01:18:42,287
Haskell?

813
01:18:45,047 --> 01:18:48,047
Move it!

814
01:18:52,887 --> 01:18:55,887
Get off her!

815
01:19:36,247 --> 01:19:39,247
Thanks.

816
01:19:41,087 --> 01:19:44,087
Okay, come on.

817
01:19:52,847 --> 01:19:55,847
- How much further?
- We're almost there.

818
01:19:59,887 --> 01:20:02,887
A-Z-Z. This is it!

819
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:10,566
It's okay.

820
01:20:10,567 --> 01:20:13,567
The power's out.
The power's out.

821
01:20:16,927 --> 01:20:19,446
Chickliss...

822
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:22,447
Oh man...

823
01:20:26,967 --> 01:20:30,926
- There's over one minute!
- Can't this thing go any faster?

824
01:20:36,047 --> 01:20:39,198
- Sir, we've got the grid display back.
- They're at the perimeter.

825
01:20:40,687 --> 01:20:42,806
30 seconds to clean sweep.

826
01:20:42,807 --> 01:20:45,807
Well I think it's time for our little surprise.

827
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:48,807
I hope your shortcut worked, Mr. Quigley.

828
01:21:08,207 --> 01:21:11,207
- Water.
- The auxiliary exit.

829
01:21:11,607 --> 01:21:14,526
Leads directly outside.

830
01:21:14,527 --> 01:21:17,527
- Now what?
- Can you swim?

831
01:21:25,807 --> 01:21:28,807
Jump!

832
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:38,167
Well?
Did we get them?

833
01:22:38,327 --> 01:22:41,717
Sorry Sir.
The signal got scrambled at flash point.

834
01:22:42,327 --> 01:22:45,327
I think we got 'em

835
01:22:46,807 --> 01:22:48,766
I don't like it.

836
01:22:48,767 --> 01:22:51,767
Get a squad to the exit point.

837
01:23:06,087 --> 01:23:09,087
This way!

838
01:23:53,287 --> 01:23:55,926
- Come on.
- Run! Run!

839
01:23:55,927 --> 01:23:58,927
Go!

840
01:24:20,367 --> 01:24:22,406
He's conscious.

841
01:24:22,407 --> 01:24:26,446
Thank God.
Well, welcome back Mr. Wynn.

842
01:24:26,607 --> 01:24:29,607
You're conscious.
So, we can begin now.

843
01:24:32,527 --> 01:24:34,246
"Eric Wynn,

844
01:24:34,247 --> 01:24:37,523
"as you have been found guilty
of high treason, sabotage

845
01:24:37,687 --> 01:24:40,687
"and various other crimes against
your country and your God,

846
01:24:40,847 --> 01:24:43,847
"and so on,
bla, bla, bla...

847
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:47,247
"Your sentence has been
extended for two more lifetimes."

848
01:24:47,247 --> 01:24:49,446
What sentence?
I don't remember the trial!

849
01:24:49,447 --> 01:24:52,447
Well, you were found guilty.
No further questions.

850
01:24:56,287 --> 01:24:59,046
Wait! What are you doing?

851
01:24:59,047 --> 01:25:02,562
Well, we've decided on a few modifications

852
01:25:02,727 --> 01:25:05,606
before putting you back inside.

853
01:25:05,607 --> 01:25:09,077
- Wait!
- Mr. Wynn, you are holding up progress.

854
01:25:09,247 --> 01:25:11,406
Don't I get a choice?

855
01:25:11,407 --> 01:25:14,922
Don't all the condemned get a choice?
I choose death!

856
01:25:17,447 --> 01:25:19,886
No, Mr. Wynn.

857
01:25:19,887 --> 01:25:22,086
You do not get a choice.

858
01:25:22,087 --> 01:25:24,046
You have already made your choice.

859
01:25:24,047 --> 01:25:27,047
I believe this is your signature?

860
01:25:34,887 --> 01:25:37,046
- I don't understand.
- "I don't understand".

861
01:25:37,047 --> 01:25:40,926
You chose to become a test subject.
Many years ago.

862
01:25:41,607 --> 01:25:44,446
And you simply don't remember that.

863
01:25:44,447 --> 01:25:46,726
It's all standard procedure.

864
01:25:46,727 --> 01:25:49,727
But my job?
Dodd? Owen? Chickliss?

865
01:25:49,847 --> 01:25:51,806
All lab rats. Just Like you.

866
01:25:51,807 --> 01:25:54,406
Observing the observers,
you know, that kind of thing.

867
01:25:54,407 --> 01:25:57,407
Very interesting results.

868
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:01,726
Wait!

869
01:26:01,727 --> 01:26:05,322
- You're actually starting to bore me now.
- Where is she?

870
01:26:05,967 --> 01:26:10,643
Oh, the allusive Ms. Rains.
Well, you needn't worry about her.

871
01:26:14,927 --> 01:26:17,927
You didn't catch her.

872
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:42,246
He's all yours.

873
01:26:42,247 --> 01:26:45,364
- Don't touch me.
- Don't worry. This wont hurt.

874
01:26:46,287 --> 01:26:49,287
Wait!

875
01:27:07,687 --> 01:27:12,203
Mommy, I'm cold.
Why can't we have a fire?

876
01:27:13,887 --> 01:27:16,887
Because the bad people might find us.

877
01:27:19,447 --> 01:27:22,447
I have something to show you.

878
01:27:24,927 --> 01:27:27,927
See. That's us.

879
01:27:28,447 --> 01:27:31,447
We're superheroes.

880
01:27:31,647 --> 01:27:35,765
These are very special because they
were drawn by a very special person.

881
01:27:36,247 --> 01:27:39,247
Is he a superhero too?

882
01:27:40,607 --> 01:27:43,644
Yes. Yes, he is.

883
01:28:14,767 --> 01:28:17,767
What wrong with him?

884
01:28:18,407 --> 01:28:21,407
He doesn't seem to know we're here.

885
01:28:21,607 --> 01:28:24,607
This room is green.

886
01:28:44,007 --> 01:28:47,007
Hi there.

887
01:28:48,527 --> 01:28:51,527
- This room is green.
- Yes, It is.

888
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:56,127
What is it, shock?

889
01:28:56,927 --> 01:28:59,606
I wanna go back to the blue room.

890
01:28:59,607 --> 01:29:02,206
I think he's mentally handicapped.

891
01:29:02,207 --> 01:29:05,207
- That's all we need, a retard.
- Don't!

892
01:29:05,327 --> 01:29:08,327
How the hell did he survive in here?

893
01:29:09,607 --> 01:29:11,886
I wanna go back.

894
01:29:11,887 --> 01:29:13,246
I wanna go back.

895
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:15,686
Back. Back.

896
01:29:15,687 --> 01:29:18,246
I wanna go back.

897
01:29:18,247 --> 01:29:21,247
Wanna go back.
