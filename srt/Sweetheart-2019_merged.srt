1
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:17,904
Brad!

2
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,139
Brad!

3
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,080
Hello?!

4
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,651
Lucas?!

5
00:02:57,545 --> 00:03:00,345
Okay.

6
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,017
Hey.

7
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,195
Brad. Brad.

8
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,397
Hey, it's Jenn. Hey.

9
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,133
Hi. I-I'm gonna help you, okay?

10
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,535
Shit.

11
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,971
Okay. Okay, just...

12
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,140
Oh, f...

13
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,846
Help!

14
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,249
Somebody help!

15
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,054
Okay.

16
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,424
Okay.

17
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,601
- Jenn.
- Hey.

18
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,169
Did you see it?

19
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,804
What?

20
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,975
I need to find you water.
Water...

21
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,040
Here.

22
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,182
Brad.

23
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,185
Brad.

24
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,961
Oh, my God.

25
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,932
Oh, my God.

26
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,845
Hello?

27
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

28
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,813
Shit.

29
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,681
Ugh.

30
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:25,403
Oh, my God.

31
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,762
Jesus.

32
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:21,198
Come back!

33
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,968
Hey, come back!

34
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,591
Please, please.

35
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,545
No, no...

36
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:51,776
No!

37
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,659
Oh, shit!

38
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:46,330
Yes! Yes! Yes!

39
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,832
Oh, shit.

40
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

41
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

42
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:28,004
It's okay. It's okay.

43
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,913
It's okay. It's okay.

44
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:40,316
We're here now.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

45
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:42,151
It's gonna be okay.

46
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,327
God, this place is beautiful.

47
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,996
- It's a miracle.
- It's incredible.

48
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:54,831
Mmm. How is there soda here?

49
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,733
There was a family here
a long time ago,

50
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:59,302
and they left a bunch of stuff.

51
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:02,605
Mmm.

52
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:04,340
Mmm.

53
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:21,157
So, whenever you guys are ready,

54
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,159
we should get out of here.

55
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,999
Uh... back on the raft?

56
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,067
It isn't safe here.

57
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:35,938
There's...

58
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,676
...an animal...

59
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:41,878
Sweetheart, I'm sure
there's a lot of animals.

60
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,212
It's a monster.

61
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:48,284
Okay, I saw it.

62
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:52,522
It crawled out of the ocean
and it walks on land,

63
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:55,358
and it drags its food
back out to this...

64
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,861
There's a, there's a black hole
out there.

65
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,200
Okay? Zack washed up.

66
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,969
He was already dead,
and I saw it

67
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:08,705
drag him out there.

68
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:18,815
Okay. The family that-that
I was telling you about...

69
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:22,652
Look at this.

70
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:27,423
- What is this?
- Do you see that?

71
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:31,094
Th... Those are,
those are his eyes.

72
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:33,262
- It killed them.
- How could you know that?

73
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:35,732
Because I found their graves.
They were buried here.

74
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:38,015
Well, then what happened to
the person who dug the graves?

75
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,770
Now... Okay.

76
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:42,071
Well, there's clearly a current

77
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,439
pulling things
towards the island.

78
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:45,007
All right?
We all washed up here.

79
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:47,744
I say we wait, we'll see
if anyone else arrives.

80
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:49,979
Same. What if Brad shows up?

81
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:53,649
Brad's dead.

82
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:02,125
Brad's dead?

83
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:03,860
Yeah.

84
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,428
Oh, fuck...

85
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,430
I'm sorry, I...

86
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:15,471
What happened to him?

87
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:18,307
Okay, I buried him.

88
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:21,043
I buried him deep into the
ground and this creature came

89
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:22,245
and dug him up.

90
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:23,780
What does this thing look like?

91
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:25,081
It's massive.

92
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:27,316
It-it has two sets of eyes,
and it smells.

93
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:31,988
Look, I-I got it last night.

94
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,956
Okay? That's black blood.

95
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:43,766
Was he, was he in pain?

96
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:47,069
Mia, he knew
that he wasn't alone.

97
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:49,472
He knew that
I was there with him.

98
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:02,385
You still love that sound?

99
00:47:04,022 --> 00:47:07,623
I guess everyone does.

100
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,892
Don't think I'll be coming
to the beach much after this.

101
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,164
You know, out on the raft,

102
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,835
for the first time in my life,
I thought I was gonna die.

103
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:24,140
I really thought that...
that that was it.

104
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:28,477
A-And it's funny because
all I was thinking about

105
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:31,180
is how embarrassing it would be.

106
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:35,017
Everyone back home's
just waiting for me to fail.

107
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:41,557
Out on the raft,

108
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,993
you don't hear waves.

109
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:45,962
You don't hear anything.

110
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:55,371
I'd rather die on the raft
than this place.

111
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:59,442
You don't know
what it's like out there.

112
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:19,996
So, we're gonna head west.

113
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:21,998
I saw a bunch of planes
go that way.

114
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,399
I'm pretty sure they'll see us.

115
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:28,104
Okay, hey.

116
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:34,076
- I know this all sounds crazy.
- Yeah.

117
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:37,280
I really need you to believe me.

118
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:42,919
I do.

119
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:46,622
It's just a lot
to process, all right?

120
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:49,458
I mean, we just need
a little bit of time, okay?

121
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:55,932
I'm gonna get more food.

122
00:48:57,735 --> 00:49:00,636
We should bring
as much as we can.

123
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,539
Can I borrow this?

124
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:06,442
Thanks.

125
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:13,950
Hey, make sure she gets ready.

126
00:49:59,297 --> 00:50:01,030
Okay, there's enough for a week.

127
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:04,100
We got to be smart
with what we have.

128
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:05,968
All right,
let's load up the raft.

129
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,603
Jenn.

130
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:08,605
We're not leaving.

131
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:13,342
- What?
- Not right now.

132
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,978
- Not in our condition.
- We can't do it.

133
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,647
I understand that you're tired.

134
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:20,649
Guys, I'm tired, too.
I'm exhausted, but...

135
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:22,685
We're not just tired.
We're weak.

136
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:24,453
All right, we've barely eaten.

137
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,822
- Just need to rest up, all right?
- No, you don't rest here.

138
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:29,959
Jenn, you've been alone
and you're scared,

139
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:31,527
and I get that.

140
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,729
But whatever you've been seeing,
this animal...

141
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:36,132
- It's not an animal! I told you that!
- Hey, okay, listen to me,

142
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,533
there's nothing for miles, Jenn.

143
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,668
Okay? I-I say
we light a huge fire.

144
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,504
Y-You said there
are planes, right?

145
00:50:41,506 --> 00:50:44,273
We'll-we'll light a fire
and they'll see us.

146
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:56,986
It's getting dark.

147
00:50:56,988 --> 00:50:58,254
Get ready to leave.

148
00:50:58,256 --> 00:51:00,089
Sweetheart, are you even
listening to me?

149
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:02,591
We are not getting
on that fucking raft!

150
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,702
Just not tonight, all right?

151
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:16,172
We'll figure this out.

152
00:51:21,345 --> 00:51:23,312
Okay.

153
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:02,077
Lucas.

154
00:53:04,148 --> 00:53:07,183
Hey! Jenn!

155
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:08,551
Hey!

156
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,353
Stop it!

157
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,389
Stop! Jenn! Wait!

158
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:15,057
Hey! Stop!

159
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:16,492
- Get off me!
- Calm down.

160
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:19,228
- Let go of me! I'm leaving!
- Stop! Stop!

161
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,130
Stop. Just stop.

162
00:53:21,132 --> 00:53:23,065
No!

163
00:53:25,136 --> 00:53:27,336
Hey!

164
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:28,537
Hey.

165
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,306
- I'm leaving, I don't care!
- Calm down!

166
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:31,473
I don't care! No!

167
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:32,475
Stop!

168
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:20,522
Hey.

169
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:22,224
Shh. It's okay.

170
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:24,059
Where is Lucas?

171
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:26,295
He's just taking a look around.

172
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:28,731
Don't worry, it's been dark
for a few hours,

173
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:31,100
and we haven't seen anything.

174
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:32,801
You had to tie me up?

175
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:34,637
I think just for now.

176
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,305
I'm sorry.

177
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:39,608
Really, I... I shouldn't have
hit you like that.

178
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,811
I just... I didn't know
what else to do.

179
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:43,912
Yeah, I don't care.

180
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:45,948
Just...

181
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,383
untie me.

182
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,453
I think we've all been

183
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,389
through something traumatic,

184
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:55,991
and we're all just trying
to cope with it in our own

185
00:54:55,993 --> 00:54:57,826
different ways.

186
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,561
I'm just as guilty, I am.

187
00:54:59,563 --> 00:55:03,132
Guilty? Who's guilty?

188
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:05,834
I didn't make this up.

189
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:07,603
I'm not lying to you.

190
00:55:07,605 --> 00:55:08,837
Right.

191
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:10,472
Like when you got mugged
before we left.

192
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:13,175
Jenn, it's not that
I don't believe you.

193
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:15,411
It's just that, over the years,

194
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:17,279
you've made it pretty hard
for me to believe you.

195
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:18,947
This is a little different.

196
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:20,816
I just want what's best
for everyone.

197
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:24,119
I really don't need you
to tell me what's best for me.

198
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:36,365
I didn't see anything.

199
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:37,866
There's nothing out there.

200
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:39,868
'Cause it doesn't come
from the trees.

201
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:41,937
I just want you to feel safe.

202
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:43,372
We're all just trying
to figure this out.

203
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:45,507
Figure it out?

204
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,609
- Yes, figure it out.
- We need to

205
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:49,778
get away from this place
as soon as possible.

206
00:55:51,282 --> 00:55:53,048
Do you want me to give
you guys a second?

207
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,683
- Okay.
- Thank you.

208
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,989
She's really sorry
about what happened...

209
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:02,391
Yeah, she mentioned it.

210
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:04,126
Lucas, untie me.

211
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:05,894
Not until you promise me
you'll relax.

212
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:09,465
You all right?

213
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:16,438
I just want to make sure
that you're okay.

214
00:56:20,511 --> 00:56:22,311
You're fine.

215
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,324
There's always a black cloud
hanging over your head.

216
00:56:35,326 --> 00:56:36,492
You know that, right?

217
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:39,661
This whole thing, Jenn.

218
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:41,764
It's so crazy.

219
00:56:41,766 --> 00:56:44,066
I was having a great time
all week.

220
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,334
On a boat with my friends,

221
00:56:45,336 --> 00:56:47,202
weather was perfect.

222
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:49,671
Brought you
on this incredible trip.

223
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:54,276
Everyone's having a great time,
except you, right?

224
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:56,578
And the night you come up
to tell me

225
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,514
that you might not be happy,

226
00:56:58,516 --> 00:57:00,516
that you maybe don't want
to be in this...

227
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,090
...storm clouds roll in.

228
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,927
How perfect is that?

229
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,263
No matter where you go,
there's always a storm

230
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:15,464
right behind you.

231
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:18,100
Lucas, you know I love you,

232
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:21,136
but this is not the time
to talk about this.

233
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,274
Let me go.

234
00:57:28,379 --> 00:57:29,812
So, what were you gonna do?

235
00:57:29,814 --> 00:57:31,880
- What was your plan, exactly?
- I told you.

236
00:57:31,882 --> 00:57:34,783
- Head west.
- No, I get that.

237
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,486
But you head west, you get found

238
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:39,988
and brought back home.
And then what?

239
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:43,559
You've got no one else.

240
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:46,595
Where you gonna live?

241
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:49,965
You gonna go back to school?

242
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,266
And afford it how?

243
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:54,837
I pay for your life.

244
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:58,507
And you pay me back
by taking the raft

245
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:00,409
and leaving me here
to starve to death?

246
00:58:00,411 --> 00:58:02,344
You don't starve here.

247
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:04,580
That's not what happens.

248
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:06,281
You get torn into pieces
and dragged into a hole

249
00:58:06,283 --> 00:58:08,917
in the middle of the ocean.

250
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:11,086
That's what happens here.

251
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:47,256
Mia thinks you're starting
to sound a lot like Zack.

252
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:52,828
What happened to Zack?

253
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:03,839
Lucas.

254
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:06,041
Shit.
Lucas!

255
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,197
Run. Now.

256
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:32,094
Are you sure?

257
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:34,196
I've never seen it
during the day.

258
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:03,058
There's nothing
you could have done.

259
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,335
Give me a hand?

260
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:40,395
I'm gonna see
if there's anything else

261
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:42,030
we might need
from the old campsite.

262
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:19,060
All right.

263
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:20,662
Climb in.

264
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

265
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:18,787
Shit!

266
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:19,821
It grabbed me.

267
01:04:19,823 --> 01:04:21,256
Help me!

268
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:37,405
Shit!

269
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:51,386
Aah!

270
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You said it wouldn't come out
during the...

271
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

272
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:03,638
<i>I'm writing this letter</i>

273
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,975
<i>hoping it serves
as some sort of proof.</i>

274
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:11,613
<i>A little more than a week ago,
my boat went down in a storm,</i>

275
01:09:11,615 --> 01:09:15,116
<i>and I've been surviving
on this island since.</i>

276
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:18,419
<i>Zack and Brad from our group
are both dead.</i>

277
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:20,021
<i>Brad washed ashore</i>

278
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:23,124
<i>with me already injured
and died shortly after.</i>

279
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:24,526
<i>Days later,</i>

280
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:26,995
<i>Zack washed ashore,
already dead.</i>

281
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:29,164
<i>I never knew their last names.</i>

282
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:30,765
Shit.

283
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:33,635
<i>Mia Reed and my boyfriend,
Lucas Griffin,</i>

284
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:35,603
<i>arrived on a raft
a few days after.</i>

285
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:37,639
<i>And they were both killed
by a monster</i>

286
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:40,608
<i>that lives
just off this island.</i>

287
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:43,444
<i>And there's nothing I can do
to prove that.</i>

288
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:50,051
<i>For a lot of my life, I've
struggled with being believed.</i>

289
01:09:50,053 --> 01:09:53,888
<i>The truth doesn't always come
with a receipt.</i>

290
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:56,457
<i>Sometimes all we have
is our word.</i>

291
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,340
<i>There's no way for me
to show you</i>

292
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:13,808
<i>the things that I can tell you.</i>

293
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,877
<i>That there's a monster here</i>

294
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:17,378
<i>taller than any man
I've ever seen,</i>

295
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,515
<i>twice as fast in water
as it is on land,</i>

296
01:10:20,517 --> 01:10:22,850
<i>and it bleeds black blood.</i>

297
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:25,420
<i>For a week I've run from it
and hid from it,</i>

298
01:10:25,422 --> 01:10:27,322
<i>but not anymore.</i>

299
01:10:29,526 --> 01:10:32,093
<i>If you find this note, what's
left of my body will either</i>

300
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:35,930
<i>be on this island or deep
in a hole off the west shore.</i>

301
01:10:40,237 --> 01:10:42,937
<i>I hope this letter is enough
for you to believe my story.</i>

302
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:48,142
