00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,968
- My name is Dimitri Asna,
and I'm a graduate

5
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:46,843
of the All-Union institute
of Cinematography in Moscow.

6
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:51,188
I was entrusted
by our great leader,

7
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:52,625
Joseph Vissarionovich
Stalin,

8
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,656
to film the heroic deeds

9
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,899
of a distinguished
reconnaissance unit

10
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,934
under the command
of Sergeant Novikov.

11
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,479
I am proud to be a part
of this mission

12
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,185
in the Great Patriotic War.

13
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,873
Long live motherland,
and long live Czarevitch Stalin.

14
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:18,262
[militant percussive music]

15

[plane engine screeching]

18
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:34,959
- [speaking indistinctly]

19
00:02:34,998 --> 00:02:36,433
[chuckles]

20
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:38,439
For you.

21
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,459
[camera reel whirring]

22
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,563
- Very good, Seryosha.
Very good.

23
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:04,835
Very strong.

24
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,404
Ivan.
Ivan, don't--

25
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:08,612
Very good.
Look where you go.

26
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:10,486
Don't trip up.

27
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,552
Vanya, yes, very good.
Very good.

28
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:14,760
No, too much.
Too much, Vanya.

29
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,273
Sacha!
Hurry up there!

30
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:19,439
I need to use the other camera.

31

[clanking]

32
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:25,727
How many times must I tell you,
eh?

33
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:27,257
Be careful with it!

34
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,392
Give me.

35
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:38,056
Turn it on.
Give me.

36
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:40,432
Give me.

37
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:42,269
Turn it on.
Give me.

38
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:58,877
- There is the sniper's nest.

39
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:00,615
It's crucial
that we destroy this nest.

40
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:03,025
It's a potential death trap
for our advancing troops.

41
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:04,190
Vassili, Alexei,

42
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:05,759
you flank it
from the right and left.

43
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:07,363
Ivan and I
will divert attention.

44
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:09,104
Let's get as much gear off
as we can.

45
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:11,777
We need to be light.

46
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,222
Sacha, you stay here,

47
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,092
and you guard the gear, huh?

48
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,874
[shouting and gunfire]

49
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:24,943
- Take cover!
Kill him!

50
00:04:24,986 --> 00:04:26,751
Kill him!

51
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,494
[shouting and gunfire]

52
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:34,036
Grenade!

53
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:35,569
- Whoa!
- Grenade!

54
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,719
[explosion]

55
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:42,755

59
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:11,641
- Ah, shit!
God--

60
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:13,772
[grunts]

61
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,182
Fuck off, Dima.

62
00:05:16,454 --> 00:05:19,258
- Um, can you go behind me?

63
00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:21,598
I can't see a thing.

64
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:24,734
[distant howling]

65
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,796
Jesus Christ...

66
00:05:36,307 --> 00:05:37,742
- Sir!

67
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:38,940
Over here!

68
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,314
- Keep the fucking noise down,
boy!

69
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,179
- What the fuck?

70
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:54,847
- Ooh...

71
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:56,689
- Fucking hooligan.

72
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,011
- I don't give a shit.

73
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:11,261
We're here to help
our comrades.

74
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:14,095
Let's go.

75
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:22,690
- Bear Cobra 3-1-9
calling Mother.

76
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:24,164
Do you read me?
Over.

77
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,709
Do you read me?
Over.

78
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:31,547
Bear Cobra 3-1-9
calling Mother.

79
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:33,648
Do you read me?
Over.

80
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:36,687
[static crackling]

81
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:43,914
Dima, you think you got
some good shots today, huh?

82
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:51,065
- Can I ask you a few questions,

83
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:53,598
for the folks back home
in Russia?

84
00:06:57,988 --> 00:06:59,788
You don't sound Russian.

85
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:01,956
Where are you from?

86
00:07:01,998 --> 00:07:04,801
- Krakow, Poland.

87
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:07,175
I escaped east
when the Nazis invaded.

88
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,242
Here.

89
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,970
She is why I'm here.

90
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:19,341
- [whistling]

91
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:21,873
Seryosha, get over here.

92
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:31,033
- You think it's worth it?

93
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,770
- Maybe.

94
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,803

95
00:07:38,117 --> 00:07:41,109

- [muffled singing]

105
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:30,440
- Dima, it's only--

106
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:32,177
[men shouting]

107
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:34,846
- Moscow Jewboy!
Where are you?

108
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:36,354
[excited shouting]

109
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:38,789
You're a liberator!

110
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:40,190
[laughter]

111
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:42,388
- You Polish cunt!

112
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,958
You are going straight
to military tribunal!

113
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,468
Give me the camera!

114
00:08:47,503 --> 00:08:50,495
If you don't get off
that fucking bicycle...

115
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:54,436
Sacha!

116
00:08:54,477 --> 00:08:55,945
You drunken--

117
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,106
- [laughing]

118
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:25,906

[indistinct radio chatter]

121
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,465
- This is Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

122
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:44,097
We are trapped.

123
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:46,472
Does anyone read me?
Over.

124
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,549
This is Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

125
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,711
We are trapped.

126
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:56,583
Does anyone read me?
Over.

127
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:02,827
- Misha?
- This is Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

128
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:04,455
- Misha,
I've got something.

129
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:08,902
- [coughing]

130
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:13,807
Hello?
Tiger Bear 3-0-3?

131
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:16,310
We read you.
Over.

132
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:18,314
- We are trapped.
We can't hold out much longer.

133
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:21,146
Our position
is 51-17-28 north

134
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:24,622
by 13-22-04 east.

135
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:26,055
Do you read me?

136
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,718
- Hello?
Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

137
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,728
What is your situation?
Over.

138
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,229
- We can't hold out much longer.

139
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:34,632
Our position
is 51-17-28 north by 13--

140
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,465
- They can't hear us.

141
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:45,078
- What one is it?

142
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,987
- Some mining village
in the middle of nowhere.

143
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:52,819
We're not far.

144
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:55,827
If we get a move on,
we could be there by noon.

145
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:58,888
- Don't you think it's strange?

146
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:00,900
Who is Tiger Bear?

147
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:03,836
I thought we were
the only reconnaissance.

148
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,668
- They're Russians--

149
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,798
our boys--

150
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,865
and they need help.

151
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:11,003
What more do you need to know?

152
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:15,414
You better inform Mother.

153
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:16,919
- I wish I could.

154
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:18,751
That crazy message

155
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:21,122
is the only thing I've received
for two days.

156
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:26,288
- Dima, pack your stuff away.

157
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:28,857
We won't wait for you.

158
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:46,711
- Eh?
Here's one, shot already, eh?

159
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:48,726
Fucking fritzie.

160
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

161
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:12,953
- Let me...

162
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:17,655
Ugh...

163
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,162
[sighs]

164
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:28,230

165
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:31,142
- [gurgling]

166
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:32,840
- Shit!

167
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:34,473
Shit.
Damn you!

168
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,846
- What's going on?

169
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,719
- Nothing.
Nothing.

170
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:42,246
Nothing is going on.

171
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,754
- Do me a favor
and stay with the squad.

172
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,437
[camera reel whirring]

173
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,514
- Is that it?

174
00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:05,593
- There's a lot of damage.

175
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,611
There's been fighting here.

176
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,023
Do you see anything?

177
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,720
- Nothing.

178
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:12,854
No Russians.

179
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:14,557
No Germans.

180
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:16,396
Not even a stinking goat.

181
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:18,231
- All right.

182
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,238
We're going through the trees

183
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:22,433
very slowly, huh?

184
00:13:24,076 --> 00:13:27,536
And you stay at the back

185
00:13:27,582 --> 00:13:30,050
and keep out of the fucking way.

186
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:20,607
- Dima!

187
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:22,171
Come on.

188
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,431
Get down, you idiot!

189
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:53,813
- I don't get it.

190
00:14:55,656 --> 00:14:58,454
That's artillery damage,

191
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:01,258
not aircraft.

192
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:05,233
We don't have artillery
within 50 kilometers of here.

193
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:06,599
Who did this?

194
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:11,234
- Let's move down to the church
and take it from there.

195
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:12,436
Move.

196
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:41,675
[crow cawing]

197
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:44,478
- I don't care who did this.

198
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:46,848
They're bastards,
whoever they are.

199
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:53,292
- Oh, God.

200
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,057
They are nuns.

201
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,623
- [gasping]

202
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,634
- Oh, God.
One is still alive.

203
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:05,930
Who did this, huh?

204
00:16:05,969 --> 00:16:07,094
Who did this to you?

205
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:08,433
It's the Nazis, right?

206
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,403
Say it's the Nazis.
Say it!

207
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:14,339
- For God's sake, Dima.
- Say it!

208
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,841
Say--say--say it.

209
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:20,072
- [moaning]

210
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:21,975
[squishing]

211
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:56,196
- Whoa!

212
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:59,226
[panting]

213
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:07,038
- Are you all right?

214
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,306
- I fell into a fucking grave,

215
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:11,175
but I'll be all right.

216
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,225
- Hey!

217
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:42,925
- What was that?

218
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:10,740
[camera reel whirring]

219
00:18:16,255 --> 00:18:18,222
[door creaking]

220
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:21,224
[dramatic music]

221
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:36,426
- What kind of church is this?

222
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:40,233
- This is more like a factory.

223
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:44,669
- Fuck...

224
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:54,812
Sacha!

225
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:56,473
None of your stupid games here,
huh?

226
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:58,504
It could be dangerous!

227
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,817
- Sacha.

228
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,912
Sacha, go down there,

229
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:10,717
see if you can find
a light switch.

230
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:11,814
- Why?

231
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:13,688
- Because we need more light.

232
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:18,484
Go.

233
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:32,130
[glass shattering]

234
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,433
Sash...

235
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:44,944
Sash!
- What?

236
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:47,708
- See if you can get
the generator started.

237
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:48,805
- Why?

238
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:50,678
- Don't argue.
Just do it.

239
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:55,375
[electronic whirring]

240
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:01,185
[metal creaking]

241
00:20:01,223 --> 00:20:02,554
One...

242
00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:03,614
- [grunting]

243
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:04,716
Ugh.

244
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,885
[electronic whirring]

245
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:10,726
[electricity crackling]

246
00:20:10,763 --> 00:20:13,526
- Hey, camera-with-legs,
come over here.

247
00:20:13,565 --> 00:20:15,031
[electricity whirring]

248
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:16,692
[steam hissing]

249
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:19,394
Hey,
look at what we have found.

250
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,174
- What's going on?

251
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:32,040
Sacha, is that you?

252
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:37,139
[electricity humming]

253
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:38,374
- Misha...

254
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:45,711
- Don't you think this is--

255
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:46,945
- No, no, no, no.
Don't touch it!

256
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:48,510
Don't touch it!

257
00:20:48,554 --> 00:20:49,543
[electricity zapping]

258
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:50,612
- Uh!

259
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:53,919
[crunching]

260
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,949
- [panting]

261
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:09,528
[electricity cracking]

262
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,559
[breathing heavily]

263
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,264
[electricity zapping]

264
00:21:18,307 --> 00:21:20,831
- What the...

265
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:24,401
- [gasping]

266
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:25,503
- Vassili, don't--

267
00:21:25,546 --> 00:21:27,034
- Don't touch it, Vassili!

268
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,412
[indistinct radio chatter]

269
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:32,245
- Can you hear me?

270
00:21:32,283 --> 00:21:33,340
I think it's blind.

271
00:21:33,383 --> 00:21:36,352
I don't think it can see us,
huh?

272
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:39,377
[cracking and gurgling]

273
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:43,946
What are you?

274
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:45,355
Can you hear me?

275
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:47,086
- [breathing heavily]

276
00:21:47,126 --> 00:21:48,423
- Let's put you
out of your miser--

277
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:49,449
[saw buzzing]

278
00:21:49,494 --> 00:21:50,984
- Misha!

279
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:52,052
- Novikov!

280
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:54,087
- Get it!
[shouting indistinctly]

281
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:55,427
- Vassili!
Vassili, get it!

282
00:21:55,465 --> 00:21:58,228
[saw buzzing]

283
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,928
Get it out!
Get it out!

284
00:22:00,968 --> 00:22:02,128
- Get it off!
Get it off me!

285
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:05,364
Get it off me!

286
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:06,871
- [growling]

287
00:22:06,906 --> 00:22:07,895
- Kill it!
Kill it!

288
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,201
Get it off him!
Get it off!

289
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,073
[gunfire]

290
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,204
- [groaning]

291
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:20,180
- Oh, my God, Misha.

292
00:22:22,082 --> 00:22:23,344
Just relax.

293
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:24,475
Just stay still.

294
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:26,450
Here, here.

295
00:22:26,485 --> 00:22:30,045
Okay, I'm not going anywhere.

296
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:31,520
I'm not going anywhere.
- [groans]

297
00:22:31,556 --> 00:22:33,614
- Don't move.
Don't move.

298
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:35,988
Sacha, for God's sakes,
turn that thing off!

299
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:45,123
- [gasping]

300
00:23:05,277 --> 00:23:06,937
Ugh!

301
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,791
- Calling Mother.
Do you read me?

302
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:39,992
Over.

303
00:23:41,668 --> 00:23:43,498
Do you read me?
Over.

304
00:23:44,904 --> 00:23:46,734
[sighs]

305
00:23:49,173 --> 00:23:51,970
We're being jammed.

306
00:23:52,008 --> 00:23:54,475
It's the only explanation.

307
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:56,374
It's been days
since I got a scratch

308
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:57,672
out of the damn thing.

309
00:23:57,712 --> 00:24:00,647
- What if we used the tower?

310
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:03,409
- That's not a bad idea.

311
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:05,610
Not a bad idea.

312
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:08,715
- Vasja.
Vasja.

313
00:24:08,753 --> 00:24:10,481
We are here now.

314
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,646
You heard that Mayday.

315
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:13,211
Our boys need help.

316
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:14,722
- Where the fuck are they,
then, eh?

317
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:17,850
- Listen, we need to search
the village properly.

318
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:20,325
Otherwise,
Novikov has died for nothing.

319
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:21,658
- [sighs]

320
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:24,595
He's right, Vasja.

321
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:25,928
Take the others.

322
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,565
I'll stay here with Sacha
and their gear.

323
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,293
Go to the village,
find someone, anyone,

324
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,631
who can tell us
what is going on here.

325
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:33,659
- Correct me if I'm wrong,
Seryosha,

326
00:24:33,703 --> 00:24:36,102
but I'm next in command
after Novikov.

327
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:37,537
- I don't think so.

328
00:24:37,573 --> 00:24:38,870
Look at the stripes.

329
00:24:38,906 --> 00:24:40,703
- Who gives a fuck
about stripes?

330
00:24:40,742 --> 00:24:42,542
I have been with this unit
longer than anyone.

331
00:24:42,576 --> 00:24:44,510
- That doesn't mean
you're in charge, Vasja!

332
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,840
- Oh, no?
[chuckles]

333
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:47,709
Well, let's ask the others.

334
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:49,043
- Vasja, Sergei is right.

335
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,513
- Shut the fuck up,
you Jewboy!

336
00:24:50,547 --> 00:24:52,447
You're here
just to make pretty pictures.

337
00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:54,609
- Vasja, you're too smart
to be in charge.

338
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:56,243
Let Seryosha have his fun.

339
00:24:56,285 --> 00:24:58,752
We can always slit his throat
later.

340
00:24:58,787 --> 00:25:01,084
- Alexei?

341
00:25:01,122 --> 00:25:03,249
Sacha?

342
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,723
You want him
to be in command?

343
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,555
The fucking radio hand?

344
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:09,583
He's not even Russian.

345
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:16,161
Okay, have it your way.

346
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:17,631
But don't come crying to me

347
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:20,635
when he leads us
into some fritzie trap.

348
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:21,930
Stop fucking filming!

349
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,960
- Comrade,
control your temper.

350
00:25:42,884 --> 00:25:45,716
- Make another sound,
I fucking shoot your balls off!

351
00:25:49,587 --> 00:25:52,077
- Alexei,
where are you going?

352
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:02,719
[muffled whimpering]

353
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:07,159
- Dima,
be safer outside.

354
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,729
Do not get in my way.

355
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:13,760
[muffled whimpering]

356
00:26:27,414 --> 00:26:29,381
- We might have found
some dinner.

357
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:31,211
Mmm.

358
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:36,483
Come here, little bunny.

359
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,781
Come over here.

360
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:40,381
Ah! Ah!

361
00:26:40,422 --> 00:26:43,413
[dogs whimpering]

362
00:26:47,094 --> 00:26:49,027
- Guys, look!
There is someone here!

363
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:50,358
[gunshot]

364
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:51,453
- No, Alexei, no!

365
00:26:51,496 --> 00:26:53,555
[dogs barking]

366
00:26:53,598 --> 00:26:55,259
Alexei!

367
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:56,926
Alexei.

368
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:58,934
We're supposed
to get a prisoner, remember,

369
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,060
to interrogate,

370
00:27:00,103 --> 00:27:03,093
find out where our boys are,
yeah?

371
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:07,400
<i>- Sie sind--
Sie sind meine Hasen.</i>

372
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:09,067
- What's the crazy old tramp
saying, eh?

373
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:11,633
- Something about
stealing his rabbits.

374
00:27:11,677 --> 00:27:12,974
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

375
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:14,307
No, no, no.

376
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:18,007
I'm liberating your rabbits
from fascist oppression.

377
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:21,041
What is this place?

378
00:27:21,084 --> 00:27:22,846
- I don't understand.
- What is this?

379
00:27:22,885 --> 00:27:23,942
- Vasja, if you let me,

380
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:27,078
I--I have experience
in this sort of...

381
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:28,145
interviews.

382
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,485
- Interviews, yeah?

383
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,456
This, I want to see.

384
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:44,428
- What is going on here, huh?

385
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:46,296
Where has everybody gone?

386
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:51,470
- Everybody's dead or run away.

387
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:53,664
- What were they running from?

388
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,210
- That's a weird camera.

389
00:28:00,244 --> 00:28:02,370
Ls that a microphone?

390
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:04,571
Are you recording sound?

391
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:07,103
I've never seen a camera
like this before.

392
00:28:08,616 --> 00:28:11,083
- [sighs]

393
00:28:11,117 --> 00:28:13,415
What were they running from?

394
00:28:13,453 --> 00:28:16,443
- I-I-I...

395
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,455
From...

396
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:19,956
From things...
- What things?

397
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,457
- The doctor makes.

398
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,118
- What things?

399
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,557
Where is the doctor now?

400
00:28:25,592 --> 00:28:26,614
- Shut it!

401
00:28:26,658 --> 00:28:28,056
Who gives a fuck
about this doctor?

402
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:30,318
We want to know
about Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

403
00:28:30,356 --> 00:28:31,686
Ivan, hold him.

404
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:33,120
- Comrade, listen.

405
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:35,620
There was obviously some sort
of secret project going on.

406
00:28:35,654 --> 00:28:37,585
- Oh, that's obvious, is it?

407
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,916
- Tiger Bear
must have been sent here

408
00:28:38,952 --> 00:28:40,316
for that very reason.

409
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:42,079
Vasja, if you find the doctor,
we'll probably find--

410
00:28:42,118 --> 00:28:43,674
- That's fucking fascinating,
comrade.

411
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:45,342
Now get the fuck
behind the camera.

412
00:28:45,383 --> 00:28:47,178
We have wasted enough time.

413
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:53,301
Where are the Russians?

414
00:28:53,347 --> 00:28:54,811
- Ah!
- Where?

415
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:55,970
- I don't know!

416
00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:58,476
[screaming]

417
00:28:58,511 --> 00:29:00,976
I just feed the animals.

418
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,839
- Where--
- Ah!

419
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,000
I'll--

420
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:07,562
I'll take you there.

421
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:09,004
- Oh, if you take me there,

422
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,629
you will never have to worry
about getting hurt ever again.

423
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,762
Come on.
Let's go.

424
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:16,292
- [grunting]

425
00:29:19,602 --> 00:29:20,965
- Keep moving!

426
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:23,898
- Vasja,
do you think this is wise?

427
00:29:23,932 --> 00:29:25,522
- Shut up.

428
00:29:25,565 --> 00:29:27,860
- What if there are more
like the ones in the church, eh?

429
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:29,057
- Here.

430
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,489
Ah.

431
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:42,424
It's down there.

432
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:44,083
- The Russian soldiers
are down there?

433
00:29:44,124 --> 00:29:45,282
- Yes.

434
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:52,144
- Down there?

435
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:53,209
- Yeah.

436
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:55,219
You--you go.
You'll see.

437
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:56,581
- It's not safe here, Vasja.

438
00:29:56,618 --> 00:29:57,981
Let us take him back
to Seryosha.

439
00:29:58,017 --> 00:30:00,209
- I'm in charge here,
so fucking do what I tell you.

440
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,374
Show us.

441
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:02,439
- No, no, I wouldn't--

442
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:03,778
- No, you fucking show us!

443
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:05,939
Come on.

444
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:07,969
- Ah! Ah!

445
00:30:19,341 --> 00:30:20,829
- Vassili,
keep an eye on him.

446
00:30:33,202 --> 00:30:35,497
How far is it?

447
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,692
Ah, this way?

448
00:30:40,432 --> 00:30:42,226
You go fir--

449
00:30:42,264 --> 00:30:44,729
Fuck.

450
00:30:44,764 --> 00:30:47,058
Where has he gone?
Where has he gone?

451
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,561
I told you,
keep an eye on him!

452
00:30:48,595 --> 00:30:50,389
- Where the hell...

453
00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:51,723
[distant rumbling]

454
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:53,555
- Now you go ahead.

455
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:56,217
[distant banging]

456
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:58,553
- Ivan, check that side.

457
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:00,215
Alexei,

458
00:31:00,256 --> 00:31:02,551
over there.

459
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:04,247
Where the hell is he?

460
00:31:11,552 --> 00:31:14,540
[electricity humming]

461
00:31:29,477 --> 00:31:31,568
[shuffling]

462
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:32,666
What?

463
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:34,402
- What?

464
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:36,600
- Shit.
What the...

465
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:38,503
- [snarling]

466
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,403
- Get out of the way!

467
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,904
[gunshot]

468
00:31:42,938 --> 00:31:46,993
[metallic clanging]

469
00:31:47,036 --> 00:31:48,626
- [roaring]

470
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
[gunfire]
- Don't shoot!
You're gonna shoot me,
you idiot!
- Get out!
Get out!

471
00:31:57,231 --> 00:31:59,254
- Go, go, go, go, go!

472
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:01,092
Shoot it!
Shoot!

473
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,027

Help!

474
00:32:03,063 --> 00:32:06,050
Alexei!
Fucking help!

475
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:07,253
- Let's get out of here, now!

476
00:32:07,294 --> 00:32:08,656
Get out of here!

477
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,455
- Which way?
Go, go, go, go!

478
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:12,786

479
00:32:12,825 --> 00:32:16,278

Ahh!

- [wailing]

482
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,881

- [screeches]

484
00:32:24,254 --> 00:32:25,718
- Shoot it!

485
00:32:25,752 --> 00:32:27,718
Kill it!
Kill it!

486
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Get the hell out of here now!
- [roars]
- One more!
One more!

487
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,246

[air raid siren wailing]

492
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:42,668
- Over here.
This way!

493
00:32:42,705 --> 00:32:44,008
This way!
This direction!

494
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,645
Here!

495
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:46,681
- Oh!
There's one more!

496
00:32:46,727 --> 00:32:47,790
There's one more there!

497
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,398
Go, go, go, go!

[saw buzzing, gunfire]

499
00:32:53,464 --> 00:32:56,744
- Watch it!
There's more, more, more!

500
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:58,921
- Guys, where are you?

501
00:32:58,962 --> 00:33:00,161
Close the door!
- Over here.

502
00:33:00,203 --> 00:33:01,574
- Close the door!

503
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,084
- Ah!

504
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,216

[air raid siren wailing]

Get it out.
- No.

525
00:33:50,553 --> 00:33:52,827
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

526
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,842
- Please...

527
00:33:54,876 --> 00:33:57,356
- Don't fret, my friend.
I'm not giving up on you yet.

528
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,921
- Leave him.
He's finished.

529
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:00,235
We're getting out of here.

530
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:01,302
- Get back to your post!

531
00:34:01,347 --> 00:34:02,946
You're supposed
to be keeping watch.

532
00:34:02,989 --> 00:34:04,189
- Fuck you!

533
00:34:04,229 --> 00:34:06,366
Those things,
they appear out of nowhere.

534
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:08,887
They could be all around us,
and we wouldn't even know.

535
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,020
Fuck out of the way.

536
00:34:10,062 --> 00:34:12,702
I'll finish him off.

537
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:14,275

Oh...

Fuck.

00:34:19,314 --> 00:34:20,948
- Vasja!

542
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,767
- I'll fucking decide
when I'm finished

543
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:26,011
and who finishes me off.

544
00:34:26,052 --> 00:34:28,863
Where's that freak?

545
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,707
- Who?

546
00:34:30,745 --> 00:34:32,048
Dima?

547
00:34:32,086 --> 00:34:35,698
- [laughing]

548
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,219
No, you idiot.

549
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:40,664
That tramp...

550
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:43,009
set us up...

551
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:45,151
Trap!

552
00:34:45,193 --> 00:34:46,666
"I just feed the animals."

553
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:47,799
[laughs]

554
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:50,651
[shallow gasping]

555
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,135
- This is your fault.

556
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:55,342
You were supposed to bring
a captive back here.

557
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,377
[nose blowing]

558
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:05,741
- Sacha.

559
00:35:05,775 --> 00:35:08,220
All quiet here?

560
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,114
- You're an educated man,
Dima.

561
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:19,583
What do you think
is going on here?

562
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,255
- I am...

563
00:35:21,296 --> 00:35:23,707
not sure.

564
00:35:23,743 --> 00:35:26,885
I think we have stumbled upon
a new Nazi weapon.

565
00:35:26,927 --> 00:35:29,236
- [exhales]

566
00:35:29,273 --> 00:35:32,587
Only the Nazis would think
of something like this...

567
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:39,456
Sewing dead people together

568
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:43,315
and giving them knives
for hands.

569
00:35:43,353 --> 00:35:45,330
It's insane.

570
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:48,140
- Or brilliant.

571
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,986
- [sighs]

572
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:51,520
No, Dima.

573
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:54,705
It's insane.

574
00:35:58,304 --> 00:35:59,332
[water dripping]

575
00:36:07,154 --> 00:36:10,971
We'll move in the morning,

576
00:36:11,008 --> 00:36:15,191
and then we'll find
this Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

577
00:36:16,406 --> 00:36:18,108
- They're dead,

578
00:36:18,149 --> 00:36:19,177
and we will be too

579
00:36:19,221 --> 00:36:21,165
if we hang around here
any longer.

580
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,947
[gunshots]

581
00:36:24,987 --> 00:36:26,187
- Sacha, go down!

582
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:27,324
Sacha!

583
00:36:29,714 --> 00:36:32,720
[shouts echoing]

584
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:39,499
- Go around!

585
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:40,632
Sacha!

586
00:36:43,525 --> 00:36:45,160
- Hands up!
Hands in the air!

587
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:46,263
Come on!

588
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:47,370
Hold your fire!

589
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,053
- [gurgling]
- Hold your fire!

590
00:36:50,095 --> 00:36:51,124
- No, no!

591
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,325
- Against the wall!

592
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:53,989
Over there!
- [grunts]

593
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:55,552
- No, that is a girl!

594
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:56,719
That's a girl!

595
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:59,724
That's a girl!
- No, no, no, no!

596
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:00,847
- Get over here!

597
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:02,819
- Vasja!
- No, no, no, no!

598
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:04,182
- Vasja!

599
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:05,977
- [whimpering]

600
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:08,639
- Enough!
Enough!

601
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,644
Where are the Russians?
- Please...

602
00:37:10,677 --> 00:37:11,869
- Where are the Russians?

603
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,534
- You are Russians, no?

604
00:37:13,575 --> 00:37:16,366
- There where other Russians
here.

605
00:37:16,404 --> 00:37:17,460
Yesterday!

606
00:37:17,503 --> 00:37:18,966
- I--I don't know.

607
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:21,294
We've been hiding.

608
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:23,850
- Just the four of you?

609
00:37:23,895 --> 00:37:26,358
- Everyone else was killed
or ran.

610
00:37:26,393 --> 00:37:27,448
It was a massacre.

611
00:37:27,491 --> 00:37:29,115
- Who killed them?

612
00:37:29,156 --> 00:37:31,244
- The undead ones.

613
00:37:31,287 --> 00:37:34,613
Listen, the gunshots
and your firelight...

614
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,307
We must hide
before they come looking.

615
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:37,971
- Where do they come from?

616
00:37:38,012 --> 00:37:40,305
- Dima, leave this to me!

617
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:43,898
How many were there?

618
00:37:43,938 --> 00:37:44,993
- We don't know.

619
00:37:45,037 --> 00:37:46,865
He keeps making more.

620
00:37:46,902 --> 00:37:48,525
We must hide now.
Please.

621
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,164
- This is bullshit.
Let's just kill them.

622
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:51,458
- No--
<i>Du darfst mich schiessen!</i>

623
00:37:51,496 --> 00:37:52,654
<i>- Nein, nein!
Bitte, bitte!</i>

624
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:54,658
<i>Du darfst mich erschiessen
statt ihr.</i>

625
00:37:54,692 --> 00:37:56,213
- What did he say?

626
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:57,880
- [whimpering]

627
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:59,886
Fritz says it's okay
if you shoot him.

628
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:01,383
He'd rather be shot
by a real man

629
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:04,710
than ripped apart
by those things out there.

630
00:38:04,748 --> 00:38:08,539
- Let's just kill them.
Keep the girl.

631
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:10,199
Come here.

632
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,864
- No, no, no, no.

633
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:14,095
I am a trained nurse, ja?

634
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:15,396
Look!
I can help your friend.

635
00:38:15,434 --> 00:38:17,330
- A trained nurse?

636
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:18,592
- I can help your friend.

637
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:21,615
[panting]

638
00:38:24,257 --> 00:38:26,516
I will help your comrade, ja?

639
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:32,047
- Here.
Just breathe.

640
00:38:32,082 --> 00:38:35,203
Vanya, breathe.

641
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:38,365
Well, can you get it off?

642
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:39,871
- I don't know.

643
00:38:39,906 --> 00:38:41,529
- You get it off,

644
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,761
and we'll let you live.

645
00:38:43,802 --> 00:38:45,923
Deal?

646
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:48,985
- I...
I can try.

647
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:50,185
- You heard him, bitch.

648
00:38:50,226 --> 00:38:51,248
Get on with it.

649
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:53,255
- Okay, Vanya,
what we'll do--

650
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,312
- [coughing]

651
00:38:54,356 --> 00:38:56,285
- Breathe.

652
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,682
- [gurgles]

653
00:38:57,718 --> 00:39:00,011
- Slowly!
Slowly!

654
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:01,411
Breathe!

655
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:02,741
- [gasping, coughing]

656
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:03,800
- Ivan...

657
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:07,294
- [gurgling]

658
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,497
- Ivan, look at the nurse.

659
00:39:08,538 --> 00:39:10,059
- [grunting]

660
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:11,760
- Don't move.

661
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:14,389
- [gurgling]

662
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:16,293

- [gasping]

664
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:22,486
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

665
00:39:22,522 --> 00:39:25,609
- Well,
that was fucking useless.

666
00:39:25,652 --> 00:39:27,173
- No, no!

667
00:39:27,217 --> 00:39:28,238
We must work together.

668
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,871
We're all human.

669
00:39:29,913 --> 00:39:31,038
Please don't hurt me.

670
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,008
Please!
No, no!

671
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:35,766
[grunting]

672
00:39:35,805 --> 00:39:36,828
- Vasja!

- No! No!

674
00:39:37,904 --> 00:39:38,960
- Vasja!

675
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,091
- Ah!

[drill buzzing]

679
00:39:48,991 --> 00:39:52,078

[bullets clanging]

687
00:40:11,397 --> 00:40:13,951
Shoot it!

Someone stop it!
Stop it!

689
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:17,571
Sacha!
Sacha, follow me!

690

703
00:40:55,257 --> 00:40:57,941
I got it.
I got it.

704
00:40:57,982 --> 00:41:00,235
I got the camera.

705
00:41:00,274 --> 00:41:02,325
Dima, I got the camera!

Sacha, give me the camera.

Over.

733
00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:20,139
We are trapped.
We can't hold out much longer.

734

Our position
is 51-17-28 north

Do you read me?
Over.

00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,320
- What's going on?

743
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:47,648
- Why don't you ask
Comrade Dima?

744
00:42:47,684 --> 00:42:50,640
- What?

745
00:42:50,674 --> 00:42:52,328
- Tell them...

746
00:42:52,368 --> 00:42:53,988
before I blow
your fucking brains out.

747
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,015
- You don't understand.

748
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,543
- Tell them!

749
00:43:00,508 --> 00:43:03,465
- There's no Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

750
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:04,959
- I don't get it.

751
00:43:04,993 --> 00:43:07,610
- Here.

752
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:10,302
It's a radio-jammer.

753
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:11,463
I couldn't understand

754
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,939
why we were getting
no signal before.

755
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:15,424
This is why.

756
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:19,933
Our comrade here
was blocking us,

757
00:43:19,977 --> 00:43:21,767
cutting us off from Mother.

758
00:43:21,805 --> 00:43:24,919
- And I was carrying
the fucking thing!

759
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,679
- He could use it
to transmit the message

760
00:43:27,718 --> 00:43:30,267
from his pack to the radio
and...

761
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,601
- And lead us here.

762
00:43:31,638 --> 00:43:32,759
So there is no...

763
00:43:32,801 --> 00:43:33,888
- No Tiger Bear,

764
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,219
no Russian soldiers
needing our help.

765
00:43:36,256 --> 00:43:39,178
- Fucking bastard!

766
00:43:39,213 --> 00:43:40,232
- Oof!

767
00:43:40,276 --> 00:43:41,432
Ah!

768
00:43:43,532 --> 00:43:44,654
- Wait, Vasja.

769
00:43:44,695 --> 00:43:46,484
Don't kill him yet.

770
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:49,308
First I want to know why.

771
00:43:49,346 --> 00:43:52,733
- We are not going anywhere.

772
00:43:52,768 --> 00:43:54,988
[coughing]

773
00:43:55,026 --> 00:43:56,680
Not going anywhere.

774
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:00,328
- That fritz must know the way.
We'll follow him.

775
00:44:00,343 --> 00:44:03,299
- That fucking old fascist?

776
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,953
- You don't understand.

777
00:44:04,994 --> 00:44:06,715
[chuckles]

778
00:44:06,755 --> 00:44:09,213
We are not leaving.

779
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,299
That's an order.

780
00:44:10,342 --> 00:44:11,396
- An order?

781
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,992
I'm going to cut his balls off--

782
00:44:13,034 --> 00:44:14,054
- Here, here, here, here.

783
00:44:14,097 --> 00:44:15,717
- Oof!

784
00:44:15,758 --> 00:44:17,378
- Read this document.

785
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,240
I'm a full captain,
your superior officer.

786
00:44:22,469 --> 00:44:24,102
I have a list
of every man in this squad's

787
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:25,920
family and loved ones.

788
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:28,575
If something happens to me...

789
00:44:28,616 --> 00:44:29,907
- What?

790
00:44:29,944 --> 00:44:31,768
- You know what will happen
to them.

791
00:44:37,054 --> 00:44:40,033
- [breathing heavily]

792
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:42,791
- Right.

793
00:44:42,835 --> 00:44:44,160
- Dima...

794
00:44:46,689 --> 00:44:48,173
Tell me...

795
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,951
Why didn't you just tell us?

796
00:44:52,993 --> 00:44:55,299
Huh?

797
00:44:55,338 --> 00:44:57,471
Why the trick?

798
00:44:57,512 --> 00:45:00,321
- This is a top secret mission.

799
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,163
The bureau was afraid
there might be a leak.

800
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:03,673
- So you let us come unprepared?

801
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,841
- No, I did not know
the exact nature

802
00:45:05,884 --> 00:45:07,585
of the work
that the doctor was working on.

803
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:10,433
- He's not a doctor.

804
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:12,274
He's a madman.

805
00:45:12,312 --> 00:45:16,319
- My orders are to capture him,
if possible.

806
00:45:16,364 --> 00:45:17,461
If not, kill him.

807
00:45:17,503 --> 00:45:18,632
- Capture?

808
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:20,170
What does
the glorious motherland...

809
00:45:20,215 --> 00:45:21,916
- Listen!
- Want with that madman?

810
00:45:21,956 --> 00:45:23,931
- Listen to me!

811
00:45:23,966 --> 00:45:25,437
This is none of your business.

812
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,972
You do your job;
you go home safe and sound.

813
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,146
Do you understand?

814
00:45:29,188 --> 00:45:30,594
- Is there even film
in that camera?

815
00:45:30,596 --> 00:45:31,897
- Yes, yes.
The film is real.

816
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:33,098
I need a record of everything

817
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:34,636
just in case
we cannot take him alive.

818
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,156
Now, Fritz,

819
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,595
we are going
to the doctor's base,

820
00:45:38,632 --> 00:45:40,971
and you--
you're taking us there.

821
00:45:41,008 --> 00:45:42,241
Which way?

822
00:45:51,857 --> 00:45:54,859
- [coughing]

823
00:46:11,713 --> 00:46:14,213
- This is the lift
up to the church.

824
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:21,083
- If these things
are a Nazi weapon,

825
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:23,598
they've turned on their master.

826
00:46:23,632 --> 00:46:26,133
Not so brilliant, huh, Dima?

827
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,467
- Ah, fuck.
- [heaving and gagging]

828
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:34,482
- Fritz,

829
00:46:34,516 --> 00:46:36,513
you used to work here,
right?

830
00:46:36,557 --> 00:46:38,394
Where is the doctor?

831
00:46:38,434 --> 00:46:39,404
- Hey!

832
00:46:39,438 --> 00:46:42,075
Which way?

833
00:46:42,116 --> 00:46:44,285
<i>- Den Gleisen.</i>

834
00:46:44,326 --> 00:46:46,095
[coughs]
<i>Folgen.</i>

835
00:46:46,134 --> 00:46:47,835
- Dima,

836
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:49,849
you can't be serious.

837
00:46:49,885 --> 00:46:52,190
You want to go to the base
of this thing?

838
00:46:52,228 --> 00:46:53,427
It's suicide.

839
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:55,304
- I thought I made it clear.

840
00:46:55,342 --> 00:46:57,511
Our job is to find and capture
the doctor.

841
00:46:57,552 --> 00:46:58,818
- Or kill.

842
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,295
Captured or killed, you said.

843
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,329
- Yes, yes, yes.
Moscow wants him alive.

844
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,942
- They're here!
- Go!

845
00:47:04,985 --> 00:47:06,012
Get out, Dima!

846
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:09,504
[gunfire]

847
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:11,376
Run, Dima!
For God's sakes!

848
00:47:11,414 --> 00:47:14,416
- [roaring]

849
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:16,629
- Get in!

850
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,507
Close the door!
Close the door!

851
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:22,553

853
00:47:24,774 --> 00:47:25,766
- Gun!

854
00:47:25,811 --> 00:47:26,804
- Get the fucking gun!

855
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:27,821
- Go!
- Come on!

856
00:47:27,855 --> 00:47:31,668
[gunfire, bullets clanging]

857
00:47:31,705 --> 00:47:33,737
Run faster!

858
00:47:33,781 --> 00:47:35,584
- Get in.

859
00:47:35,622 --> 00:47:37,757
- Close the door!

860
00:47:37,799 --> 00:47:41,613
- [roaring]

861
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,088
- Come on, let's go!

862
00:47:43,123 --> 00:47:45,121
Forget the gun!
Get inside!

863
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:48,441
[all shouting]

864
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,719
[banging]

865
00:47:50,758 --> 00:47:53,257
- Lock it in,
you fucking idiot!

866
00:47:59,664 --> 00:48:02,643
- What the fuck?

867
00:48:02,677 --> 00:48:03,807
- No, leave it!

868
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:04,979
It can't hurt us.

869
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:08,024
- [grumbling]

870
00:48:10,412 --> 00:48:12,444
- This one can't hurt us.

871
00:48:21,494 --> 00:48:23,903
At last,
we're getting somewhere.

872
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:47,005

[distant roaring, saw buzzing]

879
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:36,861
- Sacha, go down there
and take a look.

880
00:49:36,901 --> 00:49:38,875
- What?
You crazy?

881
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:40,712
- I've got a better idea.

882
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,749
Vasja, get the boy.

883
00:49:42,793 --> 00:49:44,494

In you go.

Do not trust what they tell you.

968
00:55:11,868 --> 00:55:13,764
I made a deal
with the government.

969
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:15,956

Someone told the <i>Sturmbannführer</i>
about my cats.

He asked me
if I could do the same

01:06:19,779 --> 01:06:22,076
They are not machines

01:06:36,816 --> 01:06:38,442
I feed them

1114
01:06:38,483 --> 01:06:41,779
with the same <i>Eintopf</i>
I gave you.

1115
01:06:41,817 --> 01:06:43,477
- Yes.

1116
01:06:43,518 --> 01:06:45,109
- Ah, fuck you!

1117
01:06:45,152 --> 01:06:46,176
Fuck you!

1118
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:47,445
- Here they are.

1119
01:06:47,485 --> 01:06:49,611
- [laughs]

1120
01:06:49,653 --> 01:06:52,051
- At least one is still alive.

1121
01:06:52,087 --> 01:06:53,713
- Fuck you!
Fuck you!

1122
01:06:53,754 --> 01:06:55,118
- Don't do this to me.
- Fuck you all.

1123
01:06:55,155 --> 01:06:56,382
- Don't do this to me.
- Fuck you!

1124
01:06:56,421 --> 01:06:57,547
- Fuck you!
- [spits]

1125
01:06:57,588 --> 01:06:58,611
- Fuck you!

1126
01:06:58,655 --> 01:07:00,281
[spits]
Fuck you.

1127
01:07:00,322 --> 01:07:01,288
Son of a...

1128
01:07:01,322 --> 01:07:03,788
- God...

1129
01:07:03,823 --> 01:07:04,949
- He'll be fine.

1130
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:07,321
I'll take care of him.

1131
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:08,653
Come, come, come.

1132
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,681
- [grumbling]

1133
01:07:16,626 --> 01:07:18,217
- Incredible.

1134
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,488
- Come!

1135
01:07:19,528 --> 01:07:21,323
I want to show you something.

1136
01:07:23,361 --> 01:07:24,419
Come in!

1137
01:07:24,462 --> 01:07:26,156
- Yes, yes.
I'm coming.

1138
01:07:28,929 --> 01:07:30,395
- Come here.

1139
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:32,760
I want to show you something.

1140
01:07:38,498 --> 01:07:40,124
This is the generator.

1141
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:41,223
- I see.

1142
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:42,425
- Look.

1143
01:07:42,466 --> 01:07:45,455
[electricity surging]

1144
01:07:46,866 --> 01:07:48,356
- It works.

1145
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,264
[laughs]
it works!

1146
01:07:50,301 --> 01:07:51,325
- Genius.

1147
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:52,459
This is genius!

1148
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:54,263
- Come with me.
Come.

1149
01:07:54,302 --> 01:07:55,961
I'll show you something else.

1150
01:07:57,336 --> 01:07:58,802
- Doctor...

1151
01:07:58,837 --> 01:08:00,962
- What?
- Listen.

1152
01:08:01,003 --> 01:08:02,061
[distant explosion]

1153
01:08:02,104 --> 01:08:04,333
Listen!

1154
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:06,998
Can't you hear it?

1155
01:08:07,038 --> 01:08:08,334
- What was that?

1156
01:08:08,372 --> 01:08:10,839
- It's us,
the Red Army,

1157
01:08:10,873 --> 01:08:12,168
our artillery.

1158
01:08:12,206 --> 01:08:16,196
- How far away
would you say they are?

1159
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,366
- 15 kilometers?

1160
01:08:17,408 --> 01:08:20,374
They could be here
in a matter of hours.

1161
01:08:20,408 --> 01:08:22,203
- You're telling me this
because...

1162
01:08:22,241 --> 01:08:24,265
- I am here
to offer you a deal.

1163
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:27,606
Our military leadership
is very interested in your work.

1164
01:08:27,644 --> 01:08:29,611
- Of course.

1165
01:08:29,645 --> 01:08:32,611
I'll give you my weapon
to use against Western Allies

1166
01:08:32,645 --> 01:08:35,941
to turn the whole world
into a socialist utopia, right?

1167
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:38,639
- Yes, I think we understand
each other very well.

1168
01:08:40,747 --> 01:08:42,714
- And if I refuse?

1169
01:08:42,748 --> 01:08:46,374
- We'll bomb you and your army
back to the Stone Age.

1170
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:49,405
- [mumbling and laughing]

1171
01:08:52,683 --> 01:08:54,149
Very nice.

1172
01:08:54,184 --> 01:08:56,343
How fucking cozy.

1173
01:08:58,651 --> 01:09:01,641
- [muffled mumbling]

1174
01:09:03,486 --> 01:09:05,452
- In experiments,

1175
01:09:05,487 --> 01:09:07,976
the fresher the specimens,
the better.

1176
01:09:08,021 --> 01:09:09,816
[indistinct radio chatter]

1177
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:12,980
And if I can use flesh
that is still alive,

1178
01:09:13,021 --> 01:09:15,146
I can perform miracles.

1179
01:09:15,188 --> 01:09:17,347
- Still alive?

1180
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:22,652
- Tell me,
which of these two

1181
01:09:22,689 --> 01:09:24,315
is a better Communist?

1182
01:09:24,356 --> 01:09:25,685
- Wha--what?

1183
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:31,146
- Which of these two
is a better Communist?

1184
01:09:31,191 --> 01:09:32,521
- This one
is a better Communist.

1185
01:09:32,558 --> 01:09:34,750
Don't!
No!

1186
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:35,848
I--

1187
01:09:35,891 --> 01:09:39,187
- [gasping]

1188
01:09:39,225 --> 01:09:40,316
- Hans!

1189
01:09:40,358 --> 01:09:42,347
[indistinct radio chatter]

1190
01:09:45,059 --> 01:09:46,718
Ready?
- Yes.

1191
01:09:49,993 --> 01:09:52,221
- So,<i> Sturmbannführer</i>,

1192
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,418
we meet again.

1193
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:54,757
- Viktor, <i>bitte.</i>

1194
01:09:54,794 --> 01:09:55,918
<i>Es tut mir leid dass</i>

1195
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,426
<i>wir versucht haben lhr
aufzuhalten.</i>

1196
01:09:57,461 --> 01:09:58,587
- Hush now, Dieter.

1197
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:00,594
You don't have to apologize.

1198
01:10:00,627 --> 01:10:02,253
I'm going to make it all okay.

1199
01:10:02,295 --> 01:10:03,556
- Doctor, there's no time.

1200
01:10:03,595 --> 01:10:04,822
The Red Army is almost here.

1201
01:10:04,862 --> 01:10:06,384
If you want to work for me,
you need to tell me now.

1202
01:10:06,428 --> 01:10:07,826
- Enough!

1203
01:10:07,862 --> 01:10:09,159
I said I would think about it.

1204
01:10:09,197 --> 01:10:11,663
Now focus.

1205
01:10:11,696 --> 01:10:13,526
<i>- Nein.</i>

1206
01:10:13,564 --> 01:10:14,620
[saw buzzing]

1207
01:10:14,663 --> 01:10:16,289

Viktor.

1208

[saw buzzing, grinding]

1211
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:41,192
- Dima...

[panting]

1213
01:10:43,468 --> 01:10:45,094
- Hey.

1214
01:10:45,135 --> 01:10:46,896
Hey.

1215
01:10:46,935 --> 01:10:47,958
I told you to film.

1216
01:10:48,001 --> 01:10:49,059
- Sorry.

1217
01:10:49,103 --> 01:10:52,035
- [humming]

1218
01:11:01,604 --> 01:11:02,900
- What are you doing?

1219
01:11:02,938 --> 01:11:04,529
- Don't you see?

1220
01:11:06,738 --> 01:11:08,705
I can--
I can end the war

1221
01:11:08,739 --> 01:11:10,671
by creating a new being

1222
01:11:10,705 --> 01:11:13,501
that brings them together.

1223
01:11:13,539 --> 01:11:16,994
- Are you serious?

1224
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,006
- I can make them stop.

1225
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,006
I can make them understand
each other.

1226
01:11:33,209 --> 01:11:35,198
I'll be right back.

1227
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,671
- Dima...

1228
01:11:40,709 --> 01:11:42,198
Help me.

1229
01:11:42,243 --> 01:11:43,334
Help me...

Help me, please.

Please...

1232
01:11:48,144 --> 01:11:49,939
- I can't, Seryosha.

1233
01:11:49,977 --> 01:11:53,411
I have to bring him back
no matter what.

1234
01:11:53,445 --> 01:11:54,808
- Dima...

1235
01:11:54,845 --> 01:11:55,971
[groans]

1236
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:58,308
Don't you understand?

1237
01:11:58,346 --> 01:11:59,971
He's crazy.

1238
01:12:00,012 --> 01:12:01,944
Dima, he's insane.

1239
01:12:01,979 --> 01:12:05,207
- I told you--
I told you, I can't.

1240
01:12:05,246 --> 01:12:07,712
I promise you this, Seryosha,
when I return to Moscow,

1241
01:12:07,747 --> 01:12:09,338
I will personally ensure
you're awarded

1242
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:11,107
the Hero of the Soviet Union
medal.

1243
01:12:11,147 --> 01:12:12,375
- [shouts]

1244
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:14,040

will not be forgotten.

1245

- Dima!

1246
01:12:15,148 --> 01:12:17,410
I swear, I'll kill you.

1247
01:12:17,448 --> 01:12:19,812

Dima!

1256
01:12:50,353 --> 01:12:51,785
- As you can see,

1257
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:55,014
the two halves of the brain
have been grafted together.

1258
01:12:55,054 --> 01:12:57,919
On the left side,
the Communist's.

1259
01:12:57,955 --> 01:12:59,386
Hold on.

1260
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:00,546
Yeah...

1261
01:13:00,588 --> 01:13:03,248
On the right side,
the Nazi's.

1262
01:13:05,489 --> 01:13:06,512
Yeah.

1263
01:13:06,555 --> 01:13:07,953
That will be...

1264
01:13:07,989 --> 01:13:09,285
That's too much here.

1265
01:13:09,323 --> 01:13:11,915
Okay.

1266
01:13:11,957 --> 01:13:12,945
I think--

1267
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:14,580
Oh, shit.

1268
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,852
Shit, come on.

1269
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:19,221
Okay, that's fine.

1270
01:13:31,925 --> 01:13:33,585
Let me fix that.

1271
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,656
The patient
is no longer breathing.

1272
01:13:41,694 --> 01:13:42,853
Now...

1273
01:13:44,027 --> 01:13:45,856
For the final step.

1281
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,955
from a little
readjustment problem!

1282
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,468
I can build more!

- What are you doing?

1285
01:14:35,687 --> 01:14:37,678
What are you doing?

1286
01:14:44,835 --> 01:14:47,304
- How does that work?

1287
01:14:47,338 --> 01:14:48,966
I need a different lens.

1288
01:14:49,008 --> 01:14:51,274
How do you operate this camera?

1289
01:14:53,147 --> 01:14:55,777
- Doctor, we had a deal.

1290
01:14:55,819 --> 01:14:58,949
Listen,
we had a deal, eh?

1291
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:00,288
You will be safe in Russia.

1292
01:15:00,326 --> 01:15:02,453
- What deal?

1293
01:15:02,495 --> 01:15:04,465
- I have--
I have people there.

Enemies of the state, eh?

1296
01:15:08,138 --> 01:15:10,107
You will be safe.

1297
01:15:10,141 --> 01:15:11,905
What about our deal?

1298
01:15:11,944 --> 01:15:13,585
- I am afraid
I am going to have to refuse

1299
01:15:13,613 --> 01:15:14,911
your generous offer.

1300
01:15:14,949 --> 01:15:16,747
- You are signing
your own death warrant.

1301
01:15:16,785 --> 01:15:18,413
If we don't kill you,
your own people will.

1302
01:15:18,454 --> 01:15:19,443
You understand that?

1303
01:15:19,488 --> 01:15:20,512
- Oh, yes, I know.

1304
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:22,719
I was in a prison camp,
remember?

1305
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,195
But I have other plans.

1306
01:15:25,231 --> 01:15:26,632
- No, no, no!
Don't--don't leave me!

1307
01:15:26,666 --> 01:15:28,134
Don't go!
Ah!

1308
01:15:28,169 --> 01:15:30,297
- I'll be leaving momentarily.

1309
01:15:30,339 --> 01:15:34,005
But there should be time
for one last experiment.

1310
01:15:36,884 --> 01:15:38,511
- No, you can't.
You can't.

1311
01:15:38,553 --> 01:15:40,351
- I can.
I can.

1312
01:15:40,388 --> 01:15:42,016
Come here.
Come here.

1313
01:15:42,057 --> 01:15:45,027
Now, what shall we do
with you?

1314
01:15:45,062 --> 01:15:46,529
Maybe...

1315
01:15:46,564 --> 01:15:50,196
Maybe I will build this camera
into your skull.

1316
01:15:50,237 --> 01:15:51,499
That might be fun.

1317
01:15:51,538 --> 01:15:54,532
[grunting]

1318
01:15:56,581 --> 01:15:58,413
- You fool.

1319
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:07,925
- A man--a man of vision
is always misunderstood.

1320
01:16:10,068 --> 01:16:13,871
But the film in your camera

1321
01:16:13,908 --> 01:16:16,537
will convince the doubters.

1322
01:16:16,578 --> 01:16:19,013
- You're insane!

1323
01:16:19,049 --> 01:16:20,677
You're not a doctor!

1324
01:16:20,718 --> 01:16:22,346
You're sick!
- Oh, yes.

1325
01:16:22,387 --> 01:16:23,582
- You hear me?
You're sick!

1326
01:16:23,623 --> 01:16:25,148
- Oh, yes, I'm sick.

1327
01:16:25,192 --> 01:16:26,922
Everybody's sick!

1328
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:30,297
The Nazis.
Communists.

1329
01:16:30,334 --> 01:16:32,269
Capitalists.
Everyone!

1330
01:16:32,303 --> 01:16:34,602
The sickness
cannot be cured,

1331
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,131
so it must be cut out,

1332
01:16:36,176 --> 01:16:37,804
and my creations will do that.

1333
01:16:37,845 --> 01:16:39,872
- Your creations
are fucking insanity!

1334
01:16:39,916 --> 01:16:43,785
Look at them.
They're fucking cripples!

1335
01:16:43,821 --> 01:16:45,119
- Okay.

1336
01:16:45,156 --> 01:16:46,647
My father...

1337
01:16:49,163 --> 01:16:51,462
Tried to have me locked up.

1338
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,766
He said
I was emotionally crippled.

1339
01:16:53,804 --> 01:16:56,797
- [sobbing hysterically]

1340
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,671
- I had no choice.

1341
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:07,488
I injected him with a drug
that paralyzed him,

1342
01:17:07,526 --> 01:17:09,756
but his eyes could still move,

1343
01:17:09,795 --> 01:17:11,093
so he could watch as I--

1344
01:17:11,131 --> 01:17:12,121
- No, no, no!
No, no, no!

1345
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:15,625
[explosion]

1346
01:17:15,671 --> 01:17:17,640
- What was that?

1347
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:20,551
- That is the beginning
of the carpet bombardment--

1348
01:17:20,588 --> 01:17:23,464
- I will not have time for you
after all!

1349
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:27,450
- [laughing]

1350
01:17:27,486 --> 01:17:30,728
That is--
that is my comrades

1351
01:17:30,767 --> 01:17:34,547
coming to wipe you
off the face of this planet!

1352
01:17:38,067 --> 01:17:41,070
[explosion]

1353
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,853
The deal,
the deal I offered,

1354
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:45,023
I will make it better.

1355
01:17:45,064 --> 01:17:46,834
Anything! Anything!
Tell me what you need.

1356
01:17:46,873 --> 01:17:48,506
I'll guarantee it!
- Okay, okay, okay.

1357
01:17:48,548 --> 01:17:50,523
I am afraid after I go,

1358
01:17:50,557 --> 01:17:52,760
my soldiers
may become a bit crazy.

1359
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,607
[metallic ringing]

1360
01:17:55,645 --> 01:17:58,283
- What--what are you
talking about?

1361
01:17:58,326 --> 01:18:00,459
- They obey only me,

1362
01:18:00,501 --> 01:18:02,133
and I cannot take them
with me,

1363
01:18:02,175 --> 01:18:04,813
so after I go,

1364
01:18:04,855 --> 01:18:07,092
they will turn out
against each other

1365
01:18:07,131 --> 01:18:09,769
and anything else
they find nearby.

1366
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:11,808
- [panting]

1367
01:18:13,828 --> 01:18:15,631
- I would love to tell you more,

1368
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:18,478
but I have got--
I've got to go.

1369
01:18:18,516 --> 01:18:20,788
So good luck, comrade.

1370
01:18:20,826 --> 01:18:22,527
[groans]

1371
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:24,440
The film...

1372
01:18:26,016 --> 01:18:30,493
Proof for the doubters
to make them believe.

1373
01:18:30,537 --> 01:18:31,666
- Gah!

1374
01:18:36,062 --> 01:18:38,196
- But it won't reveal
my real secrets.

1375
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:40,842
Do you know why?

1376
01:18:40,884 --> 01:18:42,220
Look at me.
Do you know why?

1377
01:18:42,257 --> 01:18:46,036
Because they are all locked up
in here.

1378
01:18:46,073 --> 01:18:48,847
So I'm going to take your camera
with me.

1379
01:18:48,886 --> 01:18:50,884
[gunshot]

1380
01:18:52,871 --> 01:18:53,968
Ugh...

1381
01:19:00,673 --> 01:19:02,739
- No!

1382
01:19:02,782 --> 01:19:04,380
Sacha!

1383
01:19:04,423 --> 01:19:07,095
You fucking idiot!

1384
01:19:07,136 --> 01:19:08,973
Idiot!

1385
01:19:11,656 --> 01:19:13,289
Well, don't just stand there!

1386
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,739
Let me loose, you fuck!

1387
01:19:15,775 --> 01:19:18,778
- [screaming]

1388
01:19:22,504 --> 01:19:24,137
- Sacha.
Sacha.

1389
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:25,949
Sacha.

1390
01:19:25,988 --> 01:19:27,323
[stammering]
Sacha!

1391
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,890
Sacha!
Sacha, no, no, no, no.

1392
01:19:28,934 --> 01:19:30,270
Sacha, come on.

1393
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:31,437
Sacha!
Sacha!

1394
01:19:31,479 --> 01:19:32,917
Sacha, no, don't leave me!

1395
01:19:32,952 --> 01:19:35,830
Please, please, please, please!
Sacha!

1396
01:19:35,866 --> 01:19:37,064
[struggling]

1397
01:19:37,104 --> 01:19:38,234
Don't leave me.

1398
01:19:38,277 --> 01:19:40,114
[explosion]

1399
01:19:40,152 --> 01:19:42,526
Sacha!

1400
01:19:42,562 --> 01:19:45,039
- [roaring]

1401
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:48,280
- Sacha.

1402
01:19:48,322 --> 01:19:51,632
- [roaring]

1403
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:53,303
- Sacha, thank God.
Sacha, thank you.

1404
01:19:53,344 --> 01:19:54,508
Sacha, listen!

1405
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:56,251
I was only trying to help
my mother!

1406
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:57,592
- No, I cannot.
I'm sorry.

1407
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:59,331
I promised to bring them
this camera, Dima.

1408
01:19:59,371 --> 01:20:00,399
- [roars]

1409
01:20:00,444 --> 01:20:03,115
- I will make sure
that you get

1410
01:20:03,156 --> 01:20:04,789
the Hero of the Soviet Union
medal.

1411
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:06,965
- Don't just stand there!

1412
01:20:07,007 --> 01:20:07,977
Please!

1413
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:11,014
- [roaring]

1414
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,566
- Help!
Help me!

1415
01:20:14,607 --> 01:20:16,137
Sacha, do something!

1416
01:20:16,181 --> 01:20:17,585
- [screeches]

1417
01:20:17,621 --> 01:20:19,961
- No!

1418
01:20:19,999 --> 01:20:21,973
- [bellowing]

1419
01:20:22,007 --> 01:20:23,172
- Ahh!

1420
01:20:36,439 --> 01:20:39,418
[militant percussive music]

1421
01:20:45,513 --> 01:20:48,492
[men singing in Russian]
