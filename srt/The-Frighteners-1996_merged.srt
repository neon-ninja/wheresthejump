1
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,219
Get off me!

2
00:01:03,728 --> 00:01:05,388
Oh, please.

3
00:01:05,897 --> 00:01:07,890
Please, don't hurt me.

4
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,240
It's wrong! She's too young!

5
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,066
The sins of the flesh will ruin her.

6
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,911
Please don't hurt me!

7
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:24,581
Please!

8
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,665
The wicked will be punished.

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

10
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,058
"The mystery heart condition that has
killed over 30 people in 4 years...

11
00:03:22,357 --> 00:03:23,851
has claimed another victim.

12
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:27,902
Doctors are baffled as to why
fit and healthy people...

13
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:30,404
are suffering massive heart attacks.

14
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,034
Many residents claim that
the 'Shadow of Death'...

15
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:36,370
has again descended on the town. "

16
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:38,701
"Shadow of Death"?
I don't like it.

17
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:42,829
That's what they're saying.
People are scared out there.

18
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:47,342
"For decades, Fairwater
has been linked with death...

19
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:51,505
following the 1964
Bradley-Bartlett murder spree.

20
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:55,184
Thirty years later,
as the death toll steadily rises...

21
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:58,399
it appears the Grim Reaper
has once again returned...

22
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:01,231
to the quiet streets of Fairwater. "

23
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:04,397
Oh, no. Steve, no.

24
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,912
I asked for a new angle.
Give me something fresh.

25
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:13,370
I want to see the human face of
this tragedy. Talk to the families.

26
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,422
How has this affected
the local community?

27
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,965
Yes, Miss Rees- Jones.

28
00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:19,343
And, Steve...

29
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:22,352
no more references
to death as a person.

30
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:06,572
Friend of the family?
Really such a shame.

31
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,245
Go on. Get out. Go on.

32
00:05:18,257 --> 00:05:19,751
Get out!

33
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:11,819
Damn.

34
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,504
Oh, my God!

35
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,683
I don't believe this.
This is not happening. My lawn!

36
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,356
You ruptured my lawn!

37
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:42,356
Hey, how you doing?

38
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:46,535
Give me a call.
I'll pay for the damages.

39
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:48,820
You're damn right! I'm suing your ass!

40
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,708
Don't get litigious. Send me a bill.

41
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:54,712
"Frank Bannister, Psychic Investigator"?

42
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:57,211
So why didn't you see
the corner coming?

43
00:06:57,549 --> 00:07:00,884
You stupid moron!
This is goddamn bullshit!

44
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,048
This will cost you big time!

45
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,801
You're paying for a new fence!

46
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:09,354
I want this lawn
completely resurfaced!

47
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:11,847
Budzo!

48
00:07:14,905 --> 00:07:18,239
I got your license plate number!
You bastard!

49
00:07:41,104 --> 00:07:42,932
This is private property.

50
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:47,443
Mrs. Bradley? I'm Dr. Lynskey.
I work at the medical center.

51
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:49,945
You do not.
I know who works there.

52
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:52,406
I started 3 months ago.

53
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:54,706
Dr. Kamins is my physician.

54
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:59,747
He's attending a funeral.
I'm seeing his patients today.

55
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:06,220
She was cutting vegetables.
The knife slipped.

56
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:10,265
She just needs a few stitches.
I'll drive you to the clinic.

57
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:12,431
That's impossible.

58
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,896
It's a deep cut.

59
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,272
Leave us antibiotics.

60
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:17,607
Mother, please.

61
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:20,277
Patricia never leaves the house.

62
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:23,112
But it hurts.

63
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:25,114
To your room this instant!

64
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:31,121
Wait. Just a minute.

65
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:36,961
Who did that to you?

66
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:42,143
I think you'd better go now,
Dr. Lynskey.

67
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:50,318
You don't know
who my daughter is, do you?

68
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,815
Patricia's not to be trusted.

69
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,152
I beg your pardon?

70
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,495
I can have her locked up
anytime I want.

71
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:05,667
They said she was
an accessory after the fact.

72
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:08,000
I know the truth.

73
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:12,508
It was cold-blooded murder.

74
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:34,163
In the space of 27
blood-soaked minutes...

75
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:39,371
12 innocent people were shot by
hospital orderly John Charles Bartlett.

76
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,169
Patients, medical staff, visitors...

77
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:47,296
no one was spared in this rampage
through Fairwater Sanatorium.

78
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:49,508
Not even the hospital chapel...

79
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:53,974
provided sanctuary, as those in prayer
were shot on their knees.

80
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,479
We're reporters.
We have to get the news!

81
00:09:57,152 --> 00:09:59,311
A seemingly senseless crime...

82
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,030
Bartlett's motive
remains a mystery to this day.

83
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:04,697
Johnny Bartlett.

84
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,695
He's got a demonic look
on his face.

85
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,870
Any comments, Johnny?

86
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:14,375
Got me a score of 12, sir.
That's one more than Starkweather.

87
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:18,216
Six years earlier,
Charles Starkweather had murdered...

88
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:21,182
eleven people
in a Nebraska killing spree.

89
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:24,227
Guess that makes me
public enemy number one!

90
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:26,803
Fifteen-year-old
Patricia Anne Bradley...

91
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:29,348
daughter of
the hospital administrator...

92
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:32,237
was also implicated in the killings.

93
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:35,192
She was madly in love
with the psychopath Bartlett.

94
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:36,571
That's her!

95
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:41,738
I was in her house this afternoon.

96
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:50,256
Terrific. We're in town 3 months and
you've befriended the Manson family.

97
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:55,215
2200 volts of electricity...

98
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:59,099
ended the life of Johnny Bartlett,
the unrepentant killer.

99
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:01,722
As they threw the switch,
he screamed:

100
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:05,109
"I got me a score of twelve.
Beat that. "

101
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:12,185
In what some considered
a miscarriage of justice...

102
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:15,316
Patricia Bradley was sentenced
to life imprisonment...

103
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:19,359
although it was never proven
she participated in the killings.

104
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:22,699
Five years ago,
Patricia Bradley was granted...

105
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:25,319
a conditional release
by the governor.

106
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:30,036
Today she lives a reclusive life
back in the family home...

107
00:11:30,878 --> 00:11:33,370
Should have fried her
along with Bartlett.

108
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:38,048
She was fifteen years old.
She fell in love with the wrong guy.

109
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:39,716
Could happen to anyone.

110
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:43,349
Sweetie, don't go back there.
Place gives me the creeps.

111
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:45,510
I don't think...

112
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:50,731
Come on, honey.

113
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:57,910
I think tiger's
getting a little lonely.

114
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:13,881
What the hell is this doing here?

115
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,893
I thought I tore this up.

116
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:20,437
- Did he come back here?
- Who?

117
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:22,891
The moron who tore up my fence!

118
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:35,618
He's alive.

119
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:39,288
Ray, get me off!

120
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,814
You sick thing!

121
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:08,162
Lucy, I don't want
that con man in my house!

122
00:13:10,402 --> 00:13:14,567
There has to be some kind
of rational explanation for this.

123
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:17,744
Ray! We have got a poltergeist!

124
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:21,081
It's nothing the police can't handle.

125
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:28,585
Bannister.

126
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,752
Dr. Lynskey, I'm on my way.

127
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:46,561
Persistent residue of the departed.
Always a problem this time of year.

128
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:49,273
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

129
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:52,238
The activity is located where?

130
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:56,623
I don't know. It went quiet
about 5 minutes ago.

131
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,957
Went quiet?

132
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,751
The dining room table spun
in a counterclockwise direction?

133
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,127
I don't think that happened.

134
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:09,800
The toilet seat lid
banged up and down?

135
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:14,808
- Did the bed levitate?
- Yeah. With me on it.

136
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:19,484
Spontaneous recurrent psychokinesis.
Oh, boy.

137
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:24,321
This could be the worst case
I've ever seen. It's bad.

138
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:30,995
Well, I can do a clearance,
but it's not going to be cheap.

139
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,129
I do offer a six-month guarantee.

140
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,336
How much?

141
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,169
249.95.

142
00:14:37,512 --> 00:14:41,842
And there is a 30% surcharge for making
a house call after midnight.

143
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,850
And there's vehicle, gas.

144
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:48,695
I'd say the whole thing will set you
back about $450.

145
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:54,611
We could forget about the fence,
call it even.

146
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:05,211
Stand back, ma'am. I don't want you
to have to sign a waiver.

147
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:08,181
Plus, a hundred bucks
for materials.

148
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,679
Just do it, for Christ's sake.

149
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,554
Here we go.

150
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:21,406
Why us? Why are they in our house?

151
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:25,028
Emanations are normally confined
to the cemetery...

152
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:26,358
although they do escape.

153
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:27,741
Usually young ones.

154
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:30,032
Oh, for God's sake, come on.

155
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,082
Come on.

156
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:41,258
It's holy water.

157
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:56,949
This is bullshit.
This is total bullshit.

158
00:15:58,286 --> 00:16:00,279
Come on...

159
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:06,793
Okay, these belong to you.

160
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,622
Six ectoplasmic emanations.

161
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:12,461
Don't worry. They can't escape.

162
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,963
Some people like a souvenir.

163
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:20,303
I really don't think we want
to keep those. Thank you. Do we, hon?

164
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,475
I could give a rat's ass.

165
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:24,810
Okay, we'll just...

166
00:16:28,991 --> 00:16:33,120
They can't feel a thing.
At least that's what the book says.

167
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:36,038
You never know for sure.

168
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:40,547
All right. Thank you, Bannister.
You can go.

169
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:45,848
What are you staring at?

170
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:49,890
What's with the number?

171
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,059
What number?

172
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:57,359
If you're trying to freak me out,
it's not working.

173
00:16:58,073 --> 00:17:01,075
He's just trying to get
more money out of us.

174
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:04,745
Get your shit and get
the hell out of my house.

175
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:06,078
Come on.

176
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:07,914
Move!

177
00:17:10,422 --> 00:17:12,250
Thank you so much.

178
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:19,422
There you go.

179
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:25,107
Why must you always
alienate everybody?

180
00:17:51,141 --> 00:17:52,802
I think I'm going to throw up.

181
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:55,475
Damn.

182
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:19,171
I hate that trunk!

183
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:23,135
I don't want ectoplasmic muck
all over my car seats.

184
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:26,351
The ectoplasm is the only thing
sticky enough...

185
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:28,679
to hold the damn car together.

186
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:33,645
I'm sorry about your shit Volvo,
but we won't ride in the trunk no more.

187
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,031
We could like to cruise
with some style, man.

188
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,194
You two left me high and dry.

189
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:43,494
I get to the house, nothing's
happening. I couldn't believe it.

190
00:18:45,044 --> 00:18:46,871
Hey, Stuart... in or out.

191
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,218
Not even a banging toilet lid.
I looked like a asshole.

192
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:55,764
We strained our backs
lifting that heavy-ass bed.

193
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:59,934
Oh, yeah. What idiot put the number
on the guy's forehead?

194
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:03,771
It wasn't funny.

195
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:07,781
Start pulling your weight,
or it's back to the cemetery.

196
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:12,288
Pull this, Frank. I'm about
to go like Jesse on your ass.

197
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:16,282
I'm going to find some other
black ghosts and organize a march.

198
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:20,751
The African-American
Apparition Coalition. The AAAC.

199
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,627
I'll tell you something.

200
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:27,092
Nothing's worse than some pissed-off
brothers that's already dead!

201
00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:42,484
Therefore, a happy ghost
is a productive ghost.

202
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:46,614
To that end, I've drawn up
a list of suggestions.

203
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:51,665
Bear in mind, we have given you
five years of loyal service.

204
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:56,679
Flies. That's what
you've given me, flies.

205
00:19:56,972 --> 00:20:00,140
Why do flies stick to you guys
like shit to a blanket?

206
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:02,345
Very funny. You're a funny guy.

207
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:05,814
You only think about yourself.
I could complain, too.

208
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:10,321
I need some new clothes. I still look
like Linc from "The Mod Squad".

209
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:12,690
You died in the '70s. Bummer.

210
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:23,547
Now, Frank,
we got to talk about cigars.

211
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:25,840
You promised to buy me a box.

212
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:29,386
I hate to tell you,
but you're dead. You can't smoke.

213
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:32,220
Light one and blow the smoke
in my face.

214
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:35,022
If I light a cigar,
I'll blow my lunch in your face.

215
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,392
Everybody, get down!
Damn it, Judge!

216
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,070
Put the shooters away!

217
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,378
That was a head shot!
He could have killed me!

218
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,057
If I wanted to get shot at every day,
I'd move to Los Angeles!

219
00:21:11,785 --> 00:21:14,787
When a man's jawbone drops off...

220
00:21:15,122 --> 00:21:18,457
it's time to reassess the situation.

221
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,958
I got myself...

222
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,797
a nice little grave
up there at the cemetery.

223
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:32,477
It could soon be time
to lay my bones.

224
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:36,562
You're my go-to guy.
Without you, I'm out of business.

225
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:38,480
Frightening...

226
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:42,322
that's a young man's game, Frank.

227
00:21:42,825 --> 00:21:45,578
I ain't got no more hauntings
left in me.

228
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:47,740
What? You're in...

229
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,745
great shape.

230
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:51,995
My joints are getting powdery.

231
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:57,001
The dog is running away with my face.
Hell, I'm falling apart.

232
00:21:57,344 --> 00:21:59,338
You have been for years.

233
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,355
Don't say nothing to the boys, but...

234
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:10,691
my ectoplasm is all dried up.

235
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:14,011
I'm sorry to hear that, Judge.

236
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,601
Give it up, Frank.

237
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:20,185
Death ain't no way
to make a living.

238
00:22:20,445 --> 00:22:21,940
I have to finish this house.

239
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:25,698
You'll never finish this house!
You'll never finish nothing!

240
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,696
You're fooling yourself, Frank!

241
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:37,214
Too many skeletons in the closet.

242
00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:41,722
Okay, this is it.
We got to be hard.

243
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:46,636
We go in like Charles Bronson.
We don't stop till the screaming starts.

244
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:48,225
I'm with you.

245
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:50,228
Let's go.

246
00:22:51,944 --> 00:22:55,729
Yeah. Let's kick some ass.

247
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,068
Here we go.
One, two, three.

248
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:02,244
Good morning,
my darlings. Hello.

249
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,075
The mail is on the table,
Mrs. Waterhouse.

250
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:09,420
Sylvia, Mother is coming for lunch.
Pick up. Quick.

251
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:13,758
Big kiss.

252
00:23:14,264 --> 00:23:17,432
Quit jumping around like a baby.
This is serious.

253
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,436
We're going to scare the living
daylights out of your parents.

254
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:25,601
- Will you help us out?
- Are you with us?

255
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,115
See? He gets it.
The kids always get it.

256
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,448
Let's go.

257
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,959
Mrs. Waterhouse.

258
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,964
Mrs. Waterhouse!

259
00:23:46,222 --> 00:23:49,224
Damn. Here, man.
This one did le poo-poo.

260
00:23:49,476 --> 00:23:51,968
- Get it away from me.
- Oh, man, it smells.

261
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,880
My babies!

262
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:09,309
Frank Bannister.

263
00:24:11,487 --> 00:24:13,813
I'm on my way.

264
00:24:19,914 --> 00:24:24,163
Persistent residue of the departed.
Always a problem this time of year.

265
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:29,333
Frank Bannister. I believe you called.
Not a minute too soon.

266
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,088
- Frank, she...
- Shut up.

267
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,506
Frank, it's no use.

268
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:34,928
This is bad.

269
00:24:35,351 --> 00:24:38,685
Recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis.

270
00:24:39,022 --> 00:24:42,190
This could be the worst case
I have ever...

271
00:24:44,446 --> 00:24:45,775
seen.

272
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:53,118
I apologize for calling you,
Mr. Bannister. Please leave.

273
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:57,871
What are you doing to me?

274
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,132
Preying on the bereaved
is as low as you can go.

275
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:04,137
You're a parasite.
People should be warned.

276
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:07,390
I've a right to offer
my services to the public.

277
00:25:07,642 --> 00:25:11,226
In case you haven't noticed,
we are having a major health crisis.

278
00:25:11,564 --> 00:25:15,230
The last thing the people here need
is a two-bit charlatan...

279
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:18,653
passing on bogus messages
from the other side.

280
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:21,066
Now, if you will excuse me.

281
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:26,407
I'm just trying to make a living.

282
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:31,414
Living? Not a word you'd know
a lot about, is it, Mr. Bannister?

283
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:36,588
Hey, easy.

284
00:26:24,992 --> 00:26:26,237
You all right, buddy?

285
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:27,738
That was quite a fall.

286
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:29,075
Bannister!

287
00:26:29,581 --> 00:26:32,251
You have to help.
They're going to bury me.

288
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:36,418
You have to help.
What is happening to me?

289
00:26:36,673 --> 00:26:38,251
You appear to be dead, Ray.

290
00:26:38,354 --> 00:26:41,272
That's impossible.
I'm in the prime of my life.

291
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:43,684
I work out.
My wife's a doctor!

292
00:26:43,945 --> 00:26:46,437
- Why didn't you take the corridor?
- What corridor?

293
00:26:47,932 --> 00:26:50,174
The passageway to the other side.

294
00:26:50,518 --> 00:26:54,765
Because I don't belong there!
Jesus Christ, I'm only 29!

295
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:03,195
Just relax, all right?
Tell me what happened.

296
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:04,208
I was on the rowing machine.

297
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:07,909
Suddenly, I felt this vice-like grip
squeezing my heart...

298
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:12,163
and I couldn't breathe, Frank,
I just couldn't breathe.

299
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:16,338
I have the shakes.
I need some vitamin B.

300
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:18,834
You can't take vitamins anymore.

301
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:23,509
You don't eat, drink or go to
the bathroom. All that's over with.

302
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:30,432
In a year, you'll get another chance
for the other side, to be a pure spirit.

303
00:27:30,693 --> 00:27:33,101
In the meantime,
you're an earthbound emanation...

304
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:38,192
a rotting cloud of bioplasmic
particles, dripping ectoplasm.

305
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:46,872
Relax, Ray.

306
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:52,547
All right, Bannister.

307
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,557
Can you give me a ride
so I don't miss my funeral?

308
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:11,401
Don't worry.
They won't hurt you.

309
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:18,160
What in the hell is going on out here?
Get back in your graves!

310
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,749
Son of a...

311
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:23,090
Holy Jesus.
Frank Bannister!

312
00:28:23,426 --> 00:28:25,253
Go ahead. I'll handle this.

313
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:32,928
What are you doing in my graveyard?
You have been told to stay away!

314
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:35,017
Sound off like you have a pair!

315
00:28:35,274 --> 00:28:36,473
It's a public place, Hiles.

316
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:37,855
I do not like you!

317
00:28:38,111 --> 00:28:42,940
Do not bring your spooks in here
without permission. Disappear, scumbag!

318
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:57,049
I am not one of your shitty
little emanations!

319
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,552
You cannot push spirits around!
You are scum!

320
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,136
Using spooks to put the frighteners on
people! That makes me physically ill!

321
00:29:07,315 --> 00:29:09,641
We have a lot of lowlifes around here!

322
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:13,485
I will provide an armed response
at any sign of trouble!

323
00:29:13,739 --> 00:29:16,231
They must be contained!

324
00:29:23,168 --> 00:29:24,663
Catch you later, Hiles.

325
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,673
My tour of duty
runs another 85 years!

326
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:31,508
There's a piece of dirt here
with your name on it.

327
00:29:31,846 --> 00:29:34,681
I'm waiting for you,
you little maggot!

328
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:38,018
There were times
when people accused Ray...

329
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,099
of being less than generous,
but I am sure that deep down...

330
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,691
the man possessed a heart of gold
and a generous spirit.

331
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:54,199
It's true. He wouldn't lie,
not at a time like this.

332
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,206
Because God has chosen...

333
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:06,304
to call Ray from this life to Himself,
we commit his body to the ground.

334
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,638
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

335
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:10,384
Jesus, what a waste.

336
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,719
It's a goddamn tragedy!

337
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:18,898
Good-bye, Ray.

338
00:30:26,246 --> 00:30:28,572
Oh, sweetheart, don't cry.

339
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:31,161
Oh, shit!

340
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:55,447
Hey, Frank!

341
00:30:58,123 --> 00:30:59,452
I know you can hear me!

342
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:01,786
Get me out of this hole!

343
00:31:02,796 --> 00:31:04,291
Frank! Get me out!

344
00:31:04,632 --> 00:31:05,961
Hiya, Frank.

345
00:31:07,136 --> 00:31:08,465
Hi, Walt.

346
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:11,807
I'm surprised to see you.
Here on business?

347
00:31:12,143 --> 00:31:13,222
Not exactly.

348
00:31:13,478 --> 00:31:15,555
They're going to bury me alive!

349
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:20,312
I hear you and Lynskey had a little
run-in the night before he died.

350
00:31:21,155 --> 00:31:23,481
Apart from his wife...

351
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:26,993
you were the last person
to see him alive.

352
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,991
You're the one here on business.

353
00:31:31,836 --> 00:31:35,337
No. The FBI is very concerned
about these deaths.

354
00:31:35,675 --> 00:31:37,253
They look like heart attacks...

355
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:41,011
but when they slice these people open,
their arteries are...

356
00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:42,846
clean as a whistle.

357
00:31:43,686 --> 00:31:46,604
But there's been tremendous pressure
on the heart...

358
00:31:46,857 --> 00:31:49,265
like the life's been
crushed out of it.

359
00:31:50,362 --> 00:31:51,856
You got any theories?

360
00:31:52,114 --> 00:31:54,606
Bannister!

361
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:00,036
You mind if I pay my last respects
before they fill him in?

362
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,204
Yeah. I'm sorry.

363
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,545
Bannister!

364
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,049
Please.

365
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,738
Mr. Bannister.

366
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:33,336
Did you want to see me?

367
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:36,258
My God, Frank, she can see me!

368
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:42,925
I thought perhaps you
might have a message from Ray.

369
00:32:43,434 --> 00:32:46,769
Tell her. Tell her I'm here, Frank.
Tell her.

370
00:32:47,023 --> 00:32:50,856
Everyone says you're a fraud,
but I've seen what you can do.

371
00:32:52,947 --> 00:32:54,276
Frank!

372
00:32:57,954 --> 00:33:01,621
You must think I'm very stupid.
Excuse me.

373
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:05,375
Lucy.

374
00:33:07,134 --> 00:33:09,127
Ray says he loves you very much.

375
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:21,810
Here is your table.

376
00:33:28,747 --> 00:33:30,823
Is Ray with us?

377
00:33:34,504 --> 00:33:36,083
Tell her she looks great.

378
00:33:37,342 --> 00:33:41,175
He says you look great.

379
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:48,752
Tell her they're from me.

380
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:50,668
Those are from Ray.

381
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:53,174
It's our anniversary.

382
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,673
He says it's your anniversary.

383
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,436
Is... Is Ray beside me?

384
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:06,942
Greetings.

385
00:34:07,198 --> 00:34:10,817
How are you this evening?
May I offer you some wine?

386
00:34:11,537 --> 00:34:14,539
Lucy, do you want some?
What... red, white?

387
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:17,035
Red. We always have red.

388
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:18,914
White.

389
00:34:19,005 --> 00:34:20,037
I've never liked red.

390
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:22,164
Lucy!

391
00:34:26,557 --> 00:34:28,883
So you used to be an architect?

392
00:34:28,976 --> 00:34:30,175
Long time ago.

393
00:34:30,395 --> 00:34:32,851
Can it. She doesn't want
to hear your life story.

394
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:36,067
Wow. So, did you
build your own house?

395
00:34:36,528 --> 00:34:37,857
Is it your dream home?

396
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:39,906
You could call it that.

397
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,201
I'll build you a dream home
once I get on my feet.

398
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:47,749
Why is it you can see Ray
and I can't?

399
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,422
I was in an accident.
It was a car accident.

400
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:55,753
About five years ago.

401
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:00,761
They say that...

402
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:05,102
sometimes when you have
a traumatic experience...

403
00:35:05,441 --> 00:35:08,277
it can alter your perception.

404
00:35:08,946 --> 00:35:11,616
So after that,
you could just see spirits?

405
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,276
I mean, what happened?

406
00:35:16,122 --> 00:35:19,622
How about you talk to Ray?
That's why I'm here.

407
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,630
Finally, I'm in the conversation.
Terrific.

408
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:26,968
I do have an important question
I have to ask Ray.

409
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,799
He can hear you.

410
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:34,307
Ray...

411
00:35:34,771 --> 00:35:38,438
I really need to know
where you invested my money.

412
00:35:39,486 --> 00:35:42,488
The $16,000 that I had saved.

413
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:44,947
The attorneys can't find it.

414
00:35:45,828 --> 00:35:48,829
Oh, shit! I blew it
on a bad investment.

415
00:35:49,165 --> 00:35:51,657
Don't tell her that.
Let me think.

416
00:35:52,002 --> 00:35:53,663
It's gone.
Lucy, it's gone.

417
00:35:54,005 --> 00:35:55,464
Blown on a bad investment.

418
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:57,003
You asshole!

419
00:35:57,343 --> 00:36:01,840
Tell her I'll look out for her.
I'll move back into the house.

420
00:36:02,141 --> 00:36:03,968
That's not a good idea.

421
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:06,178
This doesn't concern you.

422
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,809
What's Ray saying?

423
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,851
He left. Ray left.

424
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:13,818
He said he's sorry, but you
should get on with your life.

425
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:16,321
Bannister, I'm going to kill you!

426
00:36:16,702 --> 00:36:21,365
I can't believe it. That's just like
Ray to just take the money and run.

427
00:36:24,712 --> 00:36:29,708
Ray and I haven't been honest with each
other in a long time, Mr. Bannister.

428
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,891
It wasn't what you would call
a good marriage.

429
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,019
You bitch!

430
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:47,031
It'll be okay.

431
00:36:47,242 --> 00:36:48,902
Hands off my wife!

432
00:36:49,745 --> 00:36:51,074
Goddamn it!

433
00:36:52,415 --> 00:36:53,578
Sorry.

434
00:36:54,752 --> 00:36:59,082
I can move shit, Bannister.
You better watch your back.

435
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,087
I better clean this up.

436
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,716
Be right back.

437
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:26,453
Good food, huh?

438
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:30,455
Yeah... it's great.

439
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:00,433
Mom!

440
00:39:28,977 --> 00:39:32,643
Looks like another heart attack.
Can't confirm it till the autopsy.

441
00:39:32,982 --> 00:39:33,978
Damn.

442
00:39:34,943 --> 00:39:38,942
A waiter saw a guy exit the john
right before the body was found.

443
00:39:39,157 --> 00:39:40,782
And who was that?

444
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:45,287
Frank Bannister, pale and shaking.
The waiter thought he was sick.

445
00:39:45,498 --> 00:39:46,827
Damn.

446
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:49,497
Hi, Lucy.

447
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,510
Dr. Lynskey works for me.
We're colleagues.

448
00:39:54,844 --> 00:39:56,837
She's a material witness.

449
00:40:05,191 --> 00:40:08,691
Bannister was last seen
in the restaurant parking lot.

450
00:40:09,029 --> 00:40:10,690
He took off at high speed.

451
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,659
Bring him in.

452
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,162
Look at that!

453
00:40:56,758 --> 00:41:00,923
So your dead husband
was having dinner with you?

454
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:05,430
What did he order?

455
00:41:11,945 --> 00:41:13,938
Oh, God. Excuse me.

456
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:32,303
Timmy, front desk, please.

457
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,755
Thank you.

458
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:39,640
Lucy, this is Special Agent
Milton Dammers of the FBI.

459
00:41:46,448 --> 00:41:51,326
I came by train. I planned to fly,
but I didn't feel good about the plane.

460
00:41:51,622 --> 00:41:53,165
At what time...

461
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:56,954
precisely, did Bannister
leave for the bathroom?

462
00:41:59,007 --> 00:42:00,086
You.

463
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:02,835
I'm not sure...

464
00:42:03,137 --> 00:42:04,466
precisely.

465
00:42:05,015 --> 00:42:07,506
Did he use
excessive amounts of salt?

466
00:42:08,352 --> 00:42:09,467
Answer the question.

467
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:12,311
For Christ's sake,
it's really late!

468
00:42:12,524 --> 00:42:13,687
I don't remember!

469
00:42:20,702 --> 00:42:21,865
What is this?

470
00:42:22,204 --> 00:42:25,040
Excuse me, Lucy.
I'll be right back.

471
00:42:29,582 --> 00:42:30,578
Milton...

472
00:42:33,879 --> 00:42:35,208
Sorry, Sheriff.

473
00:42:36,173 --> 00:42:38,166
I have a problem
with women yelling.

474
00:42:38,676 --> 00:42:40,836
Can I get you anything?

475
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:43,007
Sheriff Perry!

476
00:42:43,683 --> 00:42:45,973
You are violating
my territorial bubble.

477
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:59,528
Lucy, you're still grieving.

478
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:03,622
It would be easy for a man
like Frank to take advantage.

479
00:43:05,046 --> 00:43:07,039
You have such closed minds.

480
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:08,295
I object!

481
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:14,058
Special Agent Dammers has over...

482
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:17,311
20 years' experience
in the area of...

483
00:43:17,646 --> 00:43:19,723
paranormal psychology.

484
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:22,393
Much of that was spent undercover...

485
00:43:22,737 --> 00:43:24,066
with various...

486
00:43:24,906 --> 00:43:26,900
cults and sects.

487
00:43:27,452 --> 00:43:30,122
I get all the fruity cases,
Mrs. Lynskey.

488
00:43:31,082 --> 00:43:33,787
For God's sake, Milton,
come in and sit down.

489
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:35,788
I'm more comfortable standing.

490
00:43:36,088 --> 00:43:38,082
What has this to do with Frank?

491
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,468
Mrs. Lynskey, you know
nothing about Frank Bannister.

492
00:43:41,763 --> 00:43:43,887
You claim
he's a bona fide psychic...

493
00:43:43,932 --> 00:43:46,769
yet all I have heard
is ill-informed, meandering waffle.

494
00:43:48,647 --> 00:43:51,318
On the third day of July 1990...

495
00:43:51,651 --> 00:43:54,986
Frank Bannister,
then a successful architect...

496
00:43:55,323 --> 00:43:58,325
was overseeing construction
of his new home.

497
00:43:59,495 --> 00:44:00,658
The contractor...

498
00:44:00,997 --> 00:44:02,492
Jacob Platz...

499
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
would later confirm that Bannister
was consuming alcohol that morning.
12:23 P.M.

500
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:14,304
Platz sees Bannister
arguing with his wife, Debra.

501
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:18,182
It appears he had
promised Debra a garden...

502
00:44:18,313 --> 00:44:23,522
and then, without consulting her,
laid a 4-inch thick concrete slab...

503
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:26,698
creating a basketball court
for himself.

504
00:44:28,035 --> 00:44:29,862
12:31 P.M.

505
00:44:30,538 --> 00:44:34,039
Platz watches the couple drive away.

506
00:44:36,045 --> 00:44:39,879
Bannister kept a tool box
in the back of his car.

507
00:44:40,218 --> 00:44:42,211
In it was a utility knife...

508
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,215
with a retractable blade.

509
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:47,892
Bannister purchased seven...

510
00:44:48,396 --> 00:44:51,232
new blades that morning...

511
00:44:51,901 --> 00:44:55,235
at Jesson's Hardware Store
and Building Supply...

512
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:58,907
on Third and Garrett...
Third and Garrett.

513
00:44:59,244 --> 00:45:00,905
Third of July.

514
00:45:01,414 --> 00:45:03,241
Seven blades. Three.

515
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:04,579
Milton...

516
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:07,867
you're mumbling; we can't
understand a word you're saying.

517
00:45:08,162 --> 00:45:10,156
12:33 P.M.

518
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:13,963
Their '84 Volvo heads into the hills.

519
00:45:14,382 --> 00:45:18,547
It is the last time anyone
will see the couple together.

520
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:20,306
By Bannister's admission...

521
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:23,477
the argument continues,
reaching a point...

522
00:45:23,776 --> 00:45:25,152
when Debra demands...

523
00:45:25,445 --> 00:45:26,477
to be let out.

524
00:45:26,822 --> 00:45:30,656
At that moment, probably 12:36,
12:37 P.M., the car...

525
00:45:30,953 --> 00:45:32,993
leaves the road on a curve...

526
00:45:33,832 --> 00:45:38,662
presumably because Bannister
was driving too fast.

527
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,336
She was killed?

528
00:45:43,846 --> 00:45:46,303
Her body was found
15 yards from the car.

529
00:45:47,184 --> 00:45:48,513
Bannister...

530
00:45:48,853 --> 00:45:52,354
was picked up 2 hours later,
wandering in the woods.

531
00:45:52,692 --> 00:45:56,027
He claimed to have no recollection
of the events...

532
00:45:56,322 --> 00:45:58,315
that occurred after the accident.

533
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,537
But here's the odd thing,
Mrs. Lynskey.

534
00:46:01,871 --> 00:46:03,532
His utility knife...

535
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:06,203
was missing.

536
00:46:06,879 --> 00:46:10,712
And to this day,
it has not been found.

537
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:15,221
But do you know
what was really bizarre?

538
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:20,393
Debra's corpse
had the number 13...

539
00:46:20,731 --> 00:46:22,725
carved into its forehead.

540
00:46:25,238 --> 00:46:26,898
Unlucky for some.

541
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,869
You're insane. You're talking
about a mythical figure.

542
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:40,256
A pseudo-religious icon
from the 12th century.

543
00:46:40,593 --> 00:46:45,589
Save your pea-brained prattle
for the classroom, boy.

544
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,102
That was the Soul Collector.

545
00:46:49,939 --> 00:46:54,437
He's been taking people out
since time began.

546
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,279
He's going about some dark business
here in Fairwater...

547
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:01,945
and we ain't nothing
but worm bait!

548
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:05,619
When your number's up...

549
00:47:06,462 --> 00:47:07,577
that's it!

550
00:47:12,804 --> 00:47:14,798
There's another one gone.

551
00:48:09,384 --> 00:48:11,342
He's gone.

552
00:48:11,387 --> 00:48:14,555
There's no money for you here,
Mr. Bannister.

553
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,223
You're next.

554
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:19,522
Are you threatening me?

555
00:48:20,024 --> 00:48:22,017
That's not what I'm saying.

556
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:23,896
He's threatening to kill me.

557
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:26,688
- Will you relax?
- He is threatening to kill me!

558
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:27,905
Bannister!

559
00:48:28,244 --> 00:48:29,573
Oh, great.

560
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:30,856
Hey, fellas.

561
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:33,865
Excuse me, excuse me.

562
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,323
Put the gun away.

563
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,365
- Freeze!
- Just take it easy.

564
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:45,050
Okay, Bannister,
you're under arrest.

565
00:48:50,703 --> 00:48:52,696
Just stay there, Bannister.

566
00:48:57,463 --> 00:48:58,376
Yes.

567
00:49:06,225 --> 00:49:07,388
Great.

568
00:49:07,727 --> 00:49:09,222
I did it.

569
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,233
Bannister. Stop.

570
00:49:12,568 --> 00:49:16,899
Looks like I ain't shooting
with blanks no more!

571
00:49:20,245 --> 00:49:23,247
Mighty fine woman.
Good teeth.

572
00:49:26,087 --> 00:49:27,202
Judge.

573
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,715
Down!

574
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:32,424
They don't call me
the hanging judge for nothing.

575
00:49:38,438 --> 00:49:40,098
Stay right there.

576
00:49:44,446 --> 00:49:45,775
Heads up!

577
00:49:46,115 --> 00:49:47,112
Good catch.

578
00:50:09,482 --> 00:50:10,645
Freeze!

579
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:17,442
Good shooting, Tex.

580
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:23,329
And she was
so young and beautiful!

581
00:50:37,856 --> 00:50:41,191
I like it when they
lie still like that.

582
00:50:47,036 --> 00:50:48,317
This is heavy.

583
00:50:53,002 --> 00:50:57,049
Hey, guys!
My juices are flowing again!

584
00:51:02,516 --> 00:51:03,512
Judge!

585
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,059
Judge!

586
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:08,686
Bannister!

587
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,894
Frank, get out of here, now!

588
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:12,733
Bastard!

589
00:51:15,076 --> 00:51:16,570
Got to go.

590
00:51:17,537 --> 00:51:18,534
Bannister!

591
00:51:18,747 --> 00:51:19,911
Stop!

592
00:51:47,121 --> 00:51:48,284
Damn! Come on!

593
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:14,779
Just get down!

594
00:52:14,994 --> 00:52:16,489
Get down and stay down.

595
00:52:58,264 --> 00:52:59,463
Magda!

596
00:53:00,184 --> 00:53:01,513
Listen to me.

597
00:53:20,755 --> 00:53:21,751
No!

598
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:35,556
Where'd he go?

599
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:44,618
You killed me, you bastard!
You're sick!

600
00:53:44,914 --> 00:53:46,575
Is this how you get your kicks?

601
00:53:46,959 --> 00:53:49,118
Did it feel good killing me?

602
00:53:49,462 --> 00:53:52,797
Did it feel good
killing your wife?

603
00:53:53,134 --> 00:53:56,302
You're a murderer!

604
00:54:08,823 --> 00:54:11,779
He won't get far.
We have the state line covered.

605
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:13,490
Sheriff Perry...

606
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:17,497
I seriously doubt we will
see Bannister any time soon.

607
00:54:17,794 --> 00:54:21,129
He is resourceful beyond anything
you can comprehend.

608
00:54:25,671 --> 00:54:27,166
Hello, Frank.

609
00:54:27,257 --> 00:54:28,253
Hey, Walt.

610
00:54:29,176 --> 00:54:31,336
I've come to report that...

611
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,508
Magda Rees- Jones's...

612
00:54:34,184 --> 00:54:37,352
body is lying near my car...

613
00:54:38,523 --> 00:54:40,018
off Holloway Road.

614
00:54:40,985 --> 00:54:43,822
Did you have anything
to do with her death?

615
00:54:49,206 --> 00:54:50,998
Frank, are you okay?

616
00:54:51,209 --> 00:54:52,372
What happened?

617
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,161
What are you doing?

618
00:54:55,716 --> 00:54:56,712
You're arresting him?

619
00:54:57,009 --> 00:54:58,041
Please leave.

620
00:54:58,386 --> 00:55:00,546
Frank, you need a lawyer.

621
00:55:00,848 --> 00:55:02,224
Go home, Lucy.

622
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,431
But you haven't done anything.
He hasn't done anything!

623
00:55:05,522 --> 00:55:06,851
How do you know?

624
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,729
Do you know me?

625
00:55:09,569 --> 00:55:11,230
Am I a nice guy?
Because...

626
00:55:12,741 --> 00:55:15,909
that cozy scene in the restaurant
was bullshit.

627
00:55:16,204 --> 00:55:17,201
Because...

628
00:55:18,249 --> 00:55:19,993
I was doing my job.

629
00:55:20,043 --> 00:55:23,081
I don't give a damn
about you or anyone.

630
00:55:23,423 --> 00:55:25,334
What are you saying?

631
00:55:25,426 --> 00:55:26,755
Go home.

632
00:55:34,106 --> 00:55:35,767
Are you okay to drive?

633
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,110
There has been a destructive force
unleashed on this town...

634
00:55:44,455 --> 00:55:46,781
such as I have never seen.

635
00:55:48,461 --> 00:55:50,121
We have a body count...

636
00:55:54,469 --> 00:55:55,964
of 28.

637
00:55:58,642 --> 00:56:00,932
You're a very dangerous man.

638
00:56:01,146 --> 00:56:04,932
You're not seriously suggesting
that Frank is responsible for...

639
00:56:05,152 --> 00:56:09,448
You're way out of your depth here,
Sheriff. Please leave.

640
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:12,320
Frank Bannister is my prisoner.

641
00:56:13,122 --> 00:56:17,786
By the power invested in me by
the President of the United States...

642
00:56:18,004 --> 00:56:19,464
I am telling you...

643
00:56:19,674 --> 00:56:22,842
to get the hell out of this room.

644
00:56:56,562 --> 00:56:59,018
Have you ever heard
of Nina Kulagina?

645
00:57:00,901 --> 00:57:04,521
March 10, 1970, Nina Kulagina,
with the power of her mind...

646
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,067
stopped the beat of a frog's heart.

647
00:57:07,411 --> 00:57:10,746
The record of this experiment
is currently held...

648
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:16,080
in the files of Professor Gennady
Sergeyev of Saint Petersburg.

649
00:57:16,591 --> 00:57:19,760
As Sergeyev
interpreted the cardiogram...

650
00:57:20,097 --> 00:57:23,717
the heart experienced
a flare-up of electrical activity.

651
00:57:23,936 --> 00:57:25,929
The heart imploded...

652
00:57:26,272 --> 00:57:30,106
all because Nina Kulagina
wanted the animal dead.

653
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,404
I don't kill people.

654
00:57:40,126 --> 00:57:42,120
Part of you believes that.

655
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:46,751
There's another part of you, Frank...

656
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:49,082
that's out of control.

657
00:57:49,926 --> 00:57:52,253
Your destructive impulse.

658
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,260
I've seen a figure in a cape.

659
00:57:58,105 --> 00:58:02,401
I've seen him reach into people's
chests and squeeze their hearts.

660
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,277
Who was it?

661
00:58:09,621 --> 00:58:11,615
Who was it?

662
00:58:14,462 --> 00:58:15,791
Death.

663
00:58:18,301 --> 00:58:20,793
I can communicate
with the other side.

664
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:23,800
I can see spirits.

665
00:58:25,644 --> 00:58:27,139
I don't know why.

666
00:58:27,647 --> 00:58:29,308
I can't understand it.

667
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:33,819
You think you're quite unique,
don't you?

668
00:58:34,324 --> 00:58:39,320
But in my business, I deal
with your type every other week.

669
00:58:40,165 --> 00:58:42,492
This death figure...

670
00:58:42,836 --> 00:58:46,171
is nothing more
than a homicidal alter ego...

671
00:58:46,466 --> 00:58:49,137
that satisfies
your compulsion to kill.

672
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,672
Every time
you want to kill someone...

673
00:58:52,976 --> 00:58:54,969
"death" does it for you.

674
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,857
It's your way
of absolving yourself of guilt.

675
00:58:57,941 --> 00:58:59,484
No!

676
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,694
When did you first start
seeing spirits? After Debra's death?

677
00:59:04,701 --> 00:59:07,537
You killed your wife.

678
00:59:07,997 --> 00:59:09,160
No!

679
00:59:10,209 --> 00:59:11,834
I have studied...

680
00:59:12,045 --> 00:59:15,380
the coroner's reports
of every death here since 1985.

681
00:59:15,717 --> 00:59:19,218
Twenty-eight cases
involved crushed hearts...

682
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,226
arteries choked until they burst.

683
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
That started in 1990, with your...
beautiful wife, Debra.
She was the first.

684
00:59:33,743 --> 00:59:35,238
Ray Lynskey.

685
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:38,249
You argue with him,
3 hours later he's dead.

686
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:41,585
We know you didn't like
Magda Rees- Jones.

687
00:59:42,589 --> 00:59:45,259
But what about the guy in the toilet?

688
00:59:46,094 --> 00:59:48,218
What did he do to you, Frank?

689
00:59:49,766 --> 00:59:51,925
Piss on your Hush Puppies?

690
00:59:54,606 --> 00:59:56,267
Why are you shaking?

691
00:59:58,779 --> 01:00:00,606
Oh, my.

692
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:05,118
My, my. You're doing it right now,
aren't you?

693
01:00:07,124 --> 01:00:10,126
You're trying to kill me, right now.

694
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,958
Well, forget it, Bannister.

695
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:16,627
I'm wearing a lead breastplate!

696
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:19,426
We have 28...

697
01:00:19,809 --> 01:00:21,803
unexplained deaths here.

698
01:00:22,146 --> 01:00:25,148
You know what I think?
I think you...

699
01:00:25,484 --> 01:00:28,486
are involved in each
and every one of them!

700
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:12,673
Well, so much for the dream home.

701
01:01:14,012 --> 01:01:15,555
What are we doing here, Lucy?

702
01:01:17,058 --> 01:01:19,729
Look at this place.
It's a dump!

703
01:01:20,397 --> 01:01:22,224
God, this guy is a loser.

704
01:01:47,269 --> 01:01:50,224
Perfectly good basketball court
gone to pot.

705
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:52,768
Yeah, Bannister.

706
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:55,112
Mr. Bannister, help me!

707
01:01:55,614 --> 01:01:59,614
My daughter, Patricia,
is communing with the Evil One.

708
01:01:59,954 --> 01:02:03,039
He's in this house
at her instigation.

709
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:06,454
Help me drive them out!

710
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:34,166
Lucy, why do you keep
shutting me out?

711
01:02:38,634 --> 01:02:39,631
Lucy!

712
01:02:44,017 --> 01:02:45,180
Patricia?

713
01:02:54,866 --> 01:02:55,862
Dr. Lynskey.

714
01:02:56,702 --> 01:02:58,530
Patricia, are you all right?

715
01:03:13,226 --> 01:03:14,507
It's your mother.

716
01:03:14,978 --> 01:03:16,639
She's been hurting you.

717
01:03:22,531 --> 01:03:26,032
She needs help.
She's delusional.

718
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:28,660
You can't go on like this.

719
01:03:30,876 --> 01:03:32,870
You don't understand.

720
01:03:38,721 --> 01:03:40,050
No!

721
01:03:45,731 --> 01:03:48,733
My father killed himself
after the murders.

722
01:03:50,405 --> 01:03:52,232
Mother says it was my fault.

723
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:56,746
So I have to keep his ashes
in my room.

724
01:03:59,584 --> 01:04:01,079
Oh, my God.

725
01:04:11,921 --> 01:04:13,582
She says I'm evil.

726
01:04:15,426 --> 01:04:17,254
Just like Johnny.

727
01:04:24,774 --> 01:04:27,610
Come with me to Mother's room.

728
01:04:42,926 --> 01:04:44,587
This isn't you.

729
01:04:46,932 --> 01:04:48,760
This isn't who you are now.

730
01:04:52,942 --> 01:04:54,935
It was Johnny.

731
01:04:56,447 --> 01:04:57,776
He went crazy.

732
01:04:59,785 --> 01:05:03,286
I couldn't get away from him.
I thought he'd kill me.

733
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:05,700
You have to get out
of this house.

734
01:05:06,128 --> 01:05:08,122
You can start over.

735
01:05:15,643 --> 01:05:17,636
It's Mother. Please hide.

736
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,309
Please.

737
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:25,151
I'll take her to the kitchen.
You sneak out later.

738
01:05:32,251 --> 01:05:33,830
What are you doing in here?

739
01:05:34,505 --> 01:05:36,083
I thought I heard a noise.

740
01:05:38,678 --> 01:05:40,837
I'll make you some coffee, Mother.

741
01:06:30,923 --> 01:06:31,920
Mother.

742
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,755
The coffee's ready.

743
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:51,780
Lucy, go.

744
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:29,671
Thank you, Deputy.

745
01:07:30,013 --> 01:07:33,514
Just call me when you're done,
Dr. Lynskey.

746
01:07:37,024 --> 01:07:38,851
Frank, listen to me.

747
01:07:39,194 --> 01:07:43,359
I found your knife,
hidden in old lady Bradley's closet.

748
01:07:43,701 --> 01:07:45,195
She's crazy, Frank.

749
01:07:46,955 --> 01:07:48,534
You haven't hurt anybody.

750
01:07:51,379 --> 01:07:53,372
You're a good person, Frank.

751
01:07:56,887 --> 01:07:58,216
Don't do this.

752
01:08:00,226 --> 01:08:01,886
Please, don't do this.

753
01:08:07,236 --> 01:08:11,568
Do you think you're the only person
who ever lost somebody?

754
01:08:12,745 --> 01:08:14,822
You walk around like you
have no feelings...

755
01:08:15,081 --> 01:08:17,835
but the truth is
you're just scared!

756
01:08:17,919 --> 01:08:18,999
Goddamn hypocrite.

757
01:08:19,088 --> 01:08:22,090
Why are you doing this?
What are you afraid of?

758
01:08:32,107 --> 01:08:34,778
I don't want to hurt you, Lucy.

759
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:37,355
Oh, that's crap.
Don't give me that.

760
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:43,616
Look at me.

761
01:09:18,511 --> 01:09:22,843
I'll be outside. This shit is like
walking in on your parents.

762
01:09:26,523 --> 01:09:29,526
Oh, right. I'll be outside.
I'll just...

763
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,183
What is it, Frank?

764
01:09:37,442 --> 01:09:38,438
Look out!

765
01:09:39,903 --> 01:09:40,935
You son of a bitch!

766
01:09:51,794 --> 01:09:53,289
What's happening?

767
01:09:53,964 --> 01:09:55,791
Grab him! Grab him!

768
01:09:58,136 --> 01:09:59,630
What's happening?

769
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:06,480
Okay. Listen to me.

770
01:10:06,814 --> 01:10:10,149
Call for the deputy.
And try to sound calm.

771
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,316
Deputy!

772
01:10:12,655 --> 01:10:14,150
I'm ready to leave.

773
01:10:18,329 --> 01:10:19,658
Where did he go?

774
01:10:23,336 --> 01:10:24,996
Stuart, where did he go?

775
01:10:25,255 --> 01:10:26,584
I think we got him.

776
01:10:38,356 --> 01:10:39,435
You son of a bitch!

777
01:10:39,691 --> 01:10:41,351
Get out, Frank! Go!

778
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:49,362
It's this way. Go.

779
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:55,370
Freeze, Bannister.

780
01:10:58,382 --> 01:11:00,043
- Help.
- I got you now.

781
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:02,880
Help me. He's gone crazy.

782
01:11:03,222 --> 01:11:05,050
Okay. Ah! Stay back!

783
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,889
Now...

784
01:11:11,733 --> 01:11:12,813
Frank, come on!

785
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:15,739
Go, Frank!
Get out of here! Now!

786
01:11:18,242 --> 01:11:20,069
Frank, let's go!

787
01:11:25,752 --> 01:11:27,745
This way. Come on.

788
01:11:45,028 --> 01:11:45,858
Shit!

789
01:11:46,112 --> 01:11:49,529
What was in that cell?
Something was crushing my heart.

790
01:11:49,784 --> 01:11:52,952
I can't fight him, Luce.
I can't protect you.

791
01:11:56,459 --> 01:11:58,785
There's one way
to deal with this thing.

792
01:11:59,297 --> 01:12:03,794
I have to have an out-of-body
experience, and I have to have it now.

793
01:12:05,805 --> 01:12:08,131
Go away, Luce.
Walk the other way.

794
01:12:10,812 --> 01:12:12,639
Wait. Wait.

795
01:12:17,154 --> 01:12:19,824
This will slow your heart
and lower your temperature.

796
01:12:28,836 --> 01:12:33,832
You'll have 20 minutes. Any longer
and there's a danger of tissue damage.

797
01:12:34,176 --> 01:12:38,341
That's only if I successfully
revive you. There's no guarantee.

798
01:12:41,352 --> 01:12:44,188
Frank, you don't have to do this.

799
01:12:44,523 --> 01:12:47,691
Better close the door.
Hurry up.

800
01:12:49,196 --> 01:12:51,355
It won't take long.

801
01:14:09,803 --> 01:14:13,220
I didn't know you had
an interest in cryogenics.

802
01:14:13,808 --> 01:14:15,386
I'm reviving him at 9:00.

803
01:14:15,644 --> 01:14:17,803
Why would we want to do that?

804
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,536
Luce!

805
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:06,373
Lucy?

806
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:17,718
There we go.

807
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

808
01:15:33,414 --> 01:15:35,241
Let me go, you bastard!

809
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,327
Let me out now!

810
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You bastard,
let me out of this car now!

811
01:17:04,034 --> 01:17:06,193
I find cemeteries very...

812
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:09,865
restful places, don't you?

813
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:13,460
Turn this car around
and take me back.

814
01:17:13,547 --> 01:17:15,706
I intend to, Mrs. Lynskey.

815
01:17:17,385 --> 01:17:20,553
In exactly... eleven hours' time.

816
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:22,717
Son of a bitch!

817
01:17:25,486 --> 01:17:29,817
Let me out of here!
Come back here, you creep!

818
01:17:48,212 --> 01:17:49,541
My body...

819
01:17:50,048 --> 01:17:52,374
is a road map of pain.

820
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:57,053
But pain...

821
01:17:58,894 --> 01:18:00,722
has its reward.

822
01:18:04,569 --> 01:18:07,571
The power of the mind...

823
01:18:10,077 --> 01:18:11,738
is absolute.

824
01:18:28,354 --> 01:18:30,347
Frank, is that you?

825
01:18:34,404 --> 01:18:35,733
I'm doing this?

826
01:18:37,284 --> 01:18:38,944
I'm doing this?

827
01:18:39,203 --> 01:18:42,122
I'm moving the car
with the power of my mind!

828
01:18:42,792 --> 01:18:43,955
Yes!

829
01:18:44,628 --> 01:18:45,624
No!

830
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:47,126
Wait!

831
01:18:51,721 --> 01:18:53,881
Get back in the goddamn ground!

832
01:18:54,141 --> 01:18:57,227
You unorganized grab-asstic gob
of teleplasmic shit!

833
01:19:12,335 --> 01:19:13,746
Who the hell are you?

834
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:15,914
Sound off like you've got a pair!

835
01:19:30,361 --> 01:19:31,856
Hey, asshole.

836
01:19:54,062 --> 01:19:55,391
He's dead!

837
01:19:55,815 --> 01:19:57,310
You're too late!

838
01:20:01,573 --> 01:20:02,736
Lucy!

839
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:26,855
Who are you?

840
01:20:29,948 --> 01:20:30,980
Who...

841
01:20:31,158 --> 01:20:32,321
are...

842
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:33,905
you?

843
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:43,251
Johnny Bartlett.

844
01:20:43,843 --> 01:20:45,920
I thought guys like you
fried in hell.

845
01:20:47,599 --> 01:20:49,426
I got out, Frank.

846
01:20:51,438 --> 01:20:55,936
I've been carrying on the good work.
Got me a score of 40.

847
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:10,457
Harry Sinclair.

848
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:14,466
I want to shake the hand
of the man who avenged my death.

849
01:21:15,014 --> 01:21:16,045
You have a number.

850
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,563
Bartlett carved it
into my forehead as I lay dying.

851
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,229
I was the last.

852
01:21:24,653 --> 01:21:27,988
He couldn't be more wrong,
could he, Frank?

853
01:21:35,919 --> 01:21:36,915
Shit!

854
01:22:23,029 --> 01:22:24,061
Oh, Frank.

855
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Just breathe.
Breathe slowly. Breathe.
You're okay.

856
01:22:32,251 --> 01:22:33,580
Oh, Frank.

857
01:22:36,758 --> 01:22:38,751
All right, Lucy, come on.

858
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:43,635
Get me 100 milligrams of lidocaine
and 1 cc of adrenaline.

859
01:22:44,978 --> 01:22:46,971
I didn't get him.

860
01:22:47,557 --> 01:22:49,883
Who? Who didn't you get, Frank?

861
01:22:51,729 --> 01:22:54,897
Johnny Bartlett. He's back.

862
01:22:56,486 --> 01:22:58,029
He's hallucinating.

863
01:23:00,408 --> 01:23:01,737
He's killing again.

864
01:23:02,411 --> 01:23:03,740
Patricia.

865
01:23:06,249 --> 01:23:08,741
You have to get her
out of the house.

866
01:23:10,004 --> 01:23:11,001
Go.

867
01:23:11,423 --> 01:23:12,752
Go!

868
01:23:27,612 --> 01:23:28,941
Patricia!

869
01:23:31,951 --> 01:23:34,787
Listen to me.
We have to get out of here.

870
01:23:35,456 --> 01:23:37,449
Patricia never leaves the house!

871
01:23:37,793 --> 01:23:39,453
She's coming with me.

872
01:23:39,795 --> 01:23:42,038
You have no right.
Get upstairs.

873
01:23:43,801 --> 01:23:45,295
This is stopping now.

874
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:46,882
What do you mean?

875
01:23:47,306 --> 01:23:49,797
Why do you have
Frank Bannister's knife?

876
01:23:50,143 --> 01:23:52,302
You've been in my room!

877
01:23:53,481 --> 01:23:54,810
Mother!

878
01:24:32,659 --> 01:24:34,736
Mother wants to go to the police.

879
01:24:37,332 --> 01:24:38,993
She'll be down in a minute.

880
01:24:39,335 --> 01:24:42,919
Patricia, we have to go now.
It's not safe here.

881
01:24:43,174 --> 01:24:44,585
Johnny Bartlett is back.

882
01:24:47,012 --> 01:24:48,258
I know.

883
01:24:51,685 --> 01:24:53,513
He visits me at night.

884
01:24:56,525 --> 01:24:58,519
I don't know why he comes.

885
01:24:59,196 --> 01:25:00,856
He torments me.

886
01:25:02,367 --> 01:25:04,360
Why has he come?

887
01:25:06,038 --> 01:25:07,866
Am I being punished?

888
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:10,415
Patricia, let's just go. Please.

889
01:25:10,461 --> 01:25:12,122
I want to kill her, Patty.

890
01:25:16,219 --> 01:25:20,052
That'll give us 41.
That's 8 clear of Gacy.

891
01:25:20,308 --> 01:25:22,301
Nine more,
we break Bundy's record.

892
01:25:22,978 --> 01:25:26,431
I can't wait to see his face
when he hears the news.

893
01:25:26,525 --> 01:25:28,767
- Yes!
- What?

894
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:32,900
I'm sorry.

895
01:25:34,411 --> 01:25:36,737
We really should wait for Mother.

896
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:42,250
That asswipe psychic
nearly ruined it for us, Patty.

897
01:25:44,091 --> 01:25:45,585
He made us look stupid.

898
01:25:45,843 --> 01:25:48,251
You'll be okay.
Everything will be fine.

899
01:25:48,597 --> 01:25:53,593
Shut up! That Russian cannibal creep
is telling everyone he did 50 plus.

900
01:25:54,772 --> 01:25:58,107
That reflects badly
on both of us, Patty.

901
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:02,354
This record should be held
by an American.

902
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:04,277
I quite agree.

903
01:26:05,954 --> 01:26:07,283
You can come...

904
01:26:10,126 --> 01:26:11,787
stay with me, if you like.

905
01:26:12,046 --> 01:26:13,374
I'll kill her now.

906
01:26:13,965 --> 01:26:15,625
I'd like that.

907
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:25,638
I'll just get my coat.

908
01:26:30,988 --> 01:26:33,824
Patronizing do-gooder bitch!

909
01:26:36,162 --> 01:26:37,491
Oh, Patricia.

910
01:26:38,832 --> 01:26:41,834
You kill her. I'll watch.

911
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,341
Mrs. Bradley?

912
01:26:54,354 --> 01:26:57,521
Mrs. Bradley,
are you coming with us?

913
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:02,859
Oh, my God.

914
01:27:38,748 --> 01:27:40,077
Lucy!

915
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,267
No, not that way!

916
01:28:27,481 --> 01:28:28,644
Jesus.

917
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:36,058
These are Bartlett's ashes.

918
01:28:37,191 --> 01:28:38,816
We must get them
to the other side.

919
01:28:40,617 --> 01:28:43,108
A church. We have to get them
to a church.

920
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:46,277
There's a chapel in the old hospital!

921
01:28:50,709 --> 01:28:52,038
No!

922
01:29:10,227 --> 01:29:11,887
Let's go down here.

923
01:29:19,402 --> 01:29:20,647
Where is it?

924
01:29:22,405 --> 01:29:24,065
You look there.

925
01:29:41,422 --> 01:29:42,418
Lucy?

926
01:29:50,264 --> 01:29:52,090
Oh, this is great.

927
01:29:54,768 --> 01:29:55,799
Frank?

928
01:29:58,688 --> 01:30:01,854
Excuse me, Doctor.
We're looking for ward 12.

929
01:30:02,191 --> 01:30:06,023
Go up the stairs to the 4th floor,
then turn right.

930
01:30:06,361 --> 01:30:08,021
It's opposite the chapel.

931
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:10,855
I'll get someone to help.
Orderly!

932
01:30:11,658 --> 01:30:13,318
Orderly, are you deaf?

933
01:30:14,702 --> 01:30:17,371
I said, orderly are you deaf?

934
01:30:20,041 --> 01:30:21,072
Moron!

935
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:33,216
I guess that makes you number one.

936
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:35,500
Get down!

937
01:30:38,724 --> 01:30:40,384
Frank, are you okay?

938
01:30:41,018 --> 01:30:43,010
The chapel's on the fourth floor.

939
01:31:18,927 --> 01:31:20,042
Watch out!

940
01:31:32,606 --> 01:31:34,765
We got to go. Go!

941
01:32:10,474 --> 01:32:11,637
Lucy.

942
01:32:13,644 --> 01:32:14,806
Lucy!

943
01:32:38,333 --> 01:32:39,957
You're all the same.

944
01:32:50,677 --> 01:32:51,673
Wait!

945
01:33:53,734 --> 01:33:55,561
Put the gun down, son.

946
01:33:55,903 --> 01:33:57,527
The law is on its way.

947
01:33:58,906 --> 01:34:00,364
What's the score, Patty?

948
01:34:04,911 --> 01:34:06,026
Eleven.

949
01:34:06,871 --> 01:34:09,243
That's the same as Starkweather's.

950
01:34:44,614 --> 01:34:45,776
Lucy?

951
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:52,735
It's jammed.

952
01:34:55,957 --> 01:34:58,282
Take it. Just take it!

953
01:35:00,253 --> 01:35:02,459
Be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

954
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Give that to me.
Let me guess.

955
01:35:32,657 --> 01:35:35,991
You must get these ashes
to consecrated ground...

956
01:35:36,327 --> 01:35:38,818
to destroy the forces of evil.

957
01:35:39,163 --> 01:35:41,156
Give me the goddamn urn!

958
01:35:41,457 --> 01:35:46,000
Under no circumstances
must these ashes ever be released.

959
01:35:51,007 --> 01:35:52,170
Oops.

960
01:35:54,302 --> 01:35:56,793
You have no idea
what you've just done.

961
01:36:01,016 --> 01:36:04,350
You just don't get it,
do you, Frank?

962
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:09,514
This is all about your pathetic need
for self-glorification.

963
01:36:11,192 --> 01:36:13,683
You are such an asshole.

964
01:36:15,363 --> 01:36:18,363
Yes, I am.
I am an asshole...

965
01:36:18,866 --> 01:36:19,862
with an Uzi!

966
01:36:22,202 --> 01:36:24,527
Get up!
You make me sick!

967
01:36:24,871 --> 01:36:25,867
Get up!

968
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:29,374
I won't shoot you in the back.
Turn around.

969
01:36:29,709 --> 01:36:30,824
I said, turn around!

970
01:36:32,656 --> 01:36:36,026
As a U.S. Government agent,
I order you to turn around!

971
01:37:22,507 --> 01:37:24,334
Oh, my God, Frank.

972
01:37:40,027 --> 01:37:41,059
Debra.

973
01:38:02,179 --> 01:38:03,175
You killed her.

974
01:38:07,727 --> 01:38:09,720
You're next, pal.

975
01:38:12,566 --> 01:38:14,559
Take him out, baby.

976
01:38:25,790 --> 01:38:26,786
Get him!

977
01:38:28,251 --> 01:38:29,247
Stop!

978
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:38,257
Frank, no!

979
01:38:42,602 --> 01:38:43,764
Get him, Patty.

980
01:39:09,133 --> 01:39:11,969
Oh, baby, you are an artist.

981
01:39:13,805 --> 01:39:15,964
You're 42!

982
01:39:27,446 --> 01:39:28,442
Yes.

983
01:39:38,793 --> 01:39:41,000
I'm in the mood
for a little vivisection.

984
01:39:41,296 --> 01:39:43,206
No! No, please.

985
01:39:43,298 --> 01:39:44,294
Me, too.

986
01:39:45,009 --> 01:39:46,503
Oh, me, too.

987
01:39:51,016 --> 01:39:52,510
You bitch!

988
01:39:58,692 --> 01:40:01,361
I got your girlfriend, Johnny!

989
01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:03,192
Come get her!

990
01:40:03,364 --> 01:40:05,191
Goddamn you!
Let go of her!

991
01:40:05,533 --> 01:40:08,369
Come and get her, you coward!

992
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:12,037
Let go of my little Patty!

993
01:40:47,207 --> 01:40:50,209
See you later, Frank!
We got you!

994
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:53,875
We're going back down
to get us some more!

995
01:40:54,591 --> 01:40:55,754
Yo, Frank!

996
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:00,590
How's it going?

997
01:41:03,435 --> 01:41:05,262
Bye, Frank.

998
01:41:08,441 --> 01:41:10,434
Johnny? Johnny!

999
01:41:11,111 --> 01:41:13,602
Step back, Frank.
This won't be pleasant.

1000
01:41:45,652 --> 01:41:50,480
The old express bus to hell.
No lines, no waiting.

1001
01:42:00,961 --> 01:42:02,504
It's really something, isn't it?

1002
01:42:03,172 --> 01:42:05,000
Excellent libraries.

1003
01:42:05,342 --> 01:42:07,002
Premium cigars.

1004
01:42:07,344 --> 01:42:08,838
And, of course...

1005
01:42:09,513 --> 01:42:10,842
the honeys.

1006
01:42:11,182 --> 01:42:14,848
How about that? Stu's
a regular chick magnet up here.

1007
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hello, Frank.
It's time to go home.

1008
01:42:28,035 --> 01:42:29,364
I am home.

1009
01:42:29,871 --> 01:42:31,698
Ahhh, no.

1010
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:37,035
The authorities have informed us
that it's just not your time.

1011
01:42:38,548 --> 01:42:40,208
Start living, dude.

1012
01:42:46,557 --> 01:42:48,052
Be happy.

1013
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1014
01:43:45,126 --> 01:43:47,285
There's something
I have to tell you.

1015
01:43:55,973 --> 01:43:57,764
Sorry to interrupt.

1016
01:43:57,808 --> 01:43:59,303
It's all right, Walt.

1017
01:44:01,813 --> 01:44:04,980
Frank, what do you know
about Ouija boards?

1018
01:44:05,275 --> 01:44:06,438
Not a lot.

1019
01:44:06,652 --> 01:44:09,488
I found a stack of them
at the Bradley house.

1020
01:44:09,572 --> 01:44:13,523
Looks like Patricia got herself
a direct line to Bartlett...

1021
01:44:13,619 --> 01:44:15,446
once she was released 5 years ago.

1022
01:44:15,663 --> 01:44:19,246
I thought you and I could collaborate
on a book about this.

1023
01:44:19,292 --> 01:44:21,368
It could be my ticket
off the force.

1024
01:44:21,461 --> 01:44:23,004
That's not my area.

1025
01:44:23,088 --> 01:44:25,544
If you need a collaborator,
how about your guardian angel there?

1026
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:35,680
You got me, Frank.

1027
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:36,849
I got you.

1028
01:44:40,859 --> 01:44:43,695
I'll see you, Frank.
Bye-bye.

1029
01:44:48,034 --> 01:44:51,036
Boy, that Dammers,
he sure looks pissed.

1030
01:44:54,542 --> 01:44:57,898
Sometimes when you go through
a traumatic experience...

1031
01:44:57,982 --> 01:44:59,700
it alters your perception.
