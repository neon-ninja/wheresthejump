1
00:00:07,112 --> 00:00:10,324
(slow, ominous music)

2
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:38,270
Welcome back to the program.

3
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:40,314
If you're just tuning
in, I'm sitting here live

4
00:00:40,356 --> 00:00:42,983
with the sole survivor of
the Miles County Massacre,

5
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:45,153
Which occurred exactly one year ago today.

6
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,590
I've worked on this show for many years

7
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,133
and I've never sat across from someone.

8
00:00:49,157 --> 00:00:51,159
Who has a story to tell quite like yours.

9
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:53,471
Thank you again for taking the time.

10
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:55,038
To sit down and speak with me.

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,539
[Survivor] It's my pleasure.

12
00:00:57,874 --> 00:00:59,269
Now when we left off we were talking.

13
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,879
About the moment you
woke up from the coma.

14
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:03,398
Do you remember your initial reaction.

15
00:01:03,422 --> 00:01:05,132
When you first saw your face?

16
00:01:05,174 --> 00:01:06,676
[Survivor] Yes.

17
00:01:06,717 --> 00:01:08,761
Would you like to share that with us?

18
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:10,179
(dramatic music)

19
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:11,305
I wished I was dead.

20
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:14,935
Do you still feel that way?

21
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:17,437
People are frightened
by the way that I look,

22
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:18,563
especially children.

23
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:22,984
And it's really difficult
for me to deal with that,

24
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:24,528
So isolation is ideal.

25
00:01:27,114 --> 00:01:28,700
Now what about your attacker,

26
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:32,912
A man identified only as Art the Clown?

27
00:01:32,954 --> 00:01:36,499
There's a lot of controversy
surrounding his supposed death.

28
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:37,893
The authorities issued
a statement claiming

29
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:40,187
that his body disappeared from
the county coroner's office.

30
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:41,629
The morning after the attack.

31
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:42,923
He's dead.

32
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:44,633
I saw it happen.

33
00:01:44,675 --> 00:01:47,594
(glass shattering)

34
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:50,764
(dramatic rock music)

35
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:13,311
Did you watch it?

36
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:15,647
Oh my God, I thought she
was going to attack me.

37
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:17,482
(dramatic music)

38
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:20,485
(people talking)

39
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:22,403
My heart was pounding the entire time.

40
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,092
Yeah well, if you think she
looks that bad on television,

41
00:03:26,116 --> 00:03:29,328
Imagine what she looks like
sitting two feet away from you.

42
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,997
I thought I was going to gag at one point.

43
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,541
Babe, do me a favor.

44
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:34,935
If I ever look like that, promise me.

45
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,460
You'll put me out of my misery.

46
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:38,796
You think I'm kidding?

47
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:39,881
I'll do it myself.

48
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:43,473
Yeah, Tom said we won't
know until the morning.

49
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,571
But he thinks the ratings
are going to go up big time.

50
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:47,806
(rustling)

51
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,896
(laughs) Exactly.

52
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:56,524
We've finally figured out
the formula for success,

53
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:59,277
Faceless victims and a host in jeopardy.

54
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:00,111
(slow, ominous music)

55
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,070
Yeah, watch next month, it's going.

56
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:03,030
To be called Monica's House of Horrors.

57
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:05,908
Shit.

58
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:06,951
Hey, can I call you back?

59
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:09,413
I have like 50 people calling me.

60
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:10,372
Okay-

61
00:04:10,414 --> 00:04:11,832
Alright, love you too.

62
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:12,874
Bye.

63
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:15,585
Hello?

64
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:18,171
Tom?

65
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:20,924
(rustling)

66
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:24,095
(slow, ominous music)

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

68
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,742
(yelling) (screaming)

69
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:47,161
(squelching)

70
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,839
(slow, ominous music)

71
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,009
(staggered breathing)

72
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,679
(coughing)

73
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,933
(laughing)

74
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,358
(tense, dramatic music)

75
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:18,819
(laughing)

76
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,571
[Dawn] I think I just twisted my ankle.

77
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:21,614
Dawn, really?

78
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:23,700
Thanks a lot, by the way.

79
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:24,534
For what?

80
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:27,412
Promising you weren't
gonna get shit faced tonight.

81
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:28,872
Guys kept buying me drinks.

82
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:31,750
I can't help it if people
find me interesting.

83
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:32,584
Yeah.

84
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:35,212
Definitely your mind that they were after.

85
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,339
Who are you texting?

86
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:37,173
None of your business.

87
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:39,384
You gave that asshole
your number, didn't you?

88
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:41,970
Oh my god, you're so jealous.

89
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:42,804
Of what?

90
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:44,239
That kid was talking to
like five other girls.

91
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:45,598
Oh, stop being such a bitch.

92
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,683
Just get in the car.

93
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:48,685
Oh, you are not driving.

94
00:05:48,726 --> 00:05:50,019
I'm fine.

95
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:51,230
Give me the keys.

96
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:52,731
Give me the keys.

97
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:54,566
Dawn, I don't feel like dying tonight.

98
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:55,609
Really?

99
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:57,277
Are we really gonna do this right now?

100
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,279
Give me the keys.

101
00:05:59,321 --> 00:06:01,699
I'm gonna paw at you like a cat.

102
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,533
Give me what I want.

103
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:04,493
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

104
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:06,162
You drive.

105
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:09,624
(chuckling) Thank you.

106
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:13,795
(wind blowing)
(slow, ominous music)

107
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:16,923
I'm fucking lit.

108
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:17,757
(laughing)

109
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:20,886
But if I get something to
eat, I can drive us, okay?

110
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:23,097
There's a place that's
open late, we can sober up.

111
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:24,515
[Dawn] Did you say food?

112
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:25,850
I said food.

113
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:27,327
You know the place, it's
right there, come on.

114
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:28,352
Okay, okay, Okay-

115
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:31,105
Just like give me one minute.

116
00:06:31,147 --> 00:06:32,273
Fuck me.

117
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:34,233
Like one minute, for real.

118
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:39,656
(slow, ominous music)

119
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:40,698
D.

120
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:44,411
(E)-

121
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:45,287
What?

122
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:46,455
[Tara] Look.

123
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:49,292
[Dawn] Holy shit.

124
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,293
Yeah, that's not funny.

125
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:51,878
I'm about to scream.

126
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,296
Hey, handsome.

127
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:54,130
Dawn, cut it out.

128
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:55,465
My friend wants your number.

129
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:57,425
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

130
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:58,259
[Dawn] Come buy us dinner.

131
00:06:58,301 --> 00:06:59,093
Stop-

132
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:00,428
Just shut the fuck up.

133
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,262
Or what?

134
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:03,097
Maybe he'll drive us home.

135
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:04,808
I'm sorry, she's drunk.

136
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:09,730
(slow, ominous music)

137
00:07:13,484 --> 00:07:14,735
Let's go.

138
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:15,611
Come on.

139
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,196
Let's just go.

140
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,866
(keys jangling)

141
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:23,453
(upbeat pop rock music)

142
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:24,287
Oh yeah?

143
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:25,329
You get dressed up?

144
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:28,083
Oh, you're a sick fuck.

145
00:07:28,124 --> 00:07:28,917
Where am I gonna go?

146
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,251
Back to my wife?

147
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:31,293
Same shit.

148
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:33,964
Maybe another two hours?

149
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:35,132
Alright.

150
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:36,217
Alright, bye-

151
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:44,934
Great.

152
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:46,894
(phone ringing)

153
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:48,563
Ugh.

154
00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:52,776
That was the longest
piss I have ever taken.

155
00:07:52,818 --> 00:07:54,569
Thank you for sharing that.

156
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:58,573
This guy wants me to meet
him at his apartment right now.

157
00:07:58,615 --> 00:07:59,407
What a shocker.

158
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:00,742
I told him I would.

159
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:01,743
What?

160
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:02,786
I'm kidding.

161
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:06,124
I have a little more
self respect than that.

162
00:08:06,165 --> 00:08:07,750
If you only had a brain.

163
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:12,338
I've been wanting to
use that one all night.

164
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,048
Congratulations.

165
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,759
(chuckling)

166
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:19,179
(rock music)

167
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:31,400
Look it's your boyfriend.

168
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:34,904
I told you this a week ago,
we'll go to your mother's.

169
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,573
I don't know, six weeks from now.

170
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:39,701
I'll be right with you buddy.

171
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,846
You gotta see the shape of this fuckin'

172
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,996
guy that just walked in.

173
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:47,710
(slow, ominous music)

174
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,360
' [Dawn] Are you okay?

175
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:17,450
(slow, ominous music)

176
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,786
I think we should get our food to go.

177
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:21,828
Why?

178
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,416
(slow, ominous music)

179
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,458
Him?

180
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:28,586
Seriously, I wanna leave.

181
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:31,048
Jesus Christ.

182
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:33,342
D, stop-

183
00:09:33,383 --> 00:09:34,383
Uh, excuse me?

184
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:36,178
Excuse me?

185
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,888
Can I get a picture with you?

186
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,722
Dawn, come on.

187
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:39,764
Shut up.

188
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,850
Hello?

189
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:45,313
(snapping)

190
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:46,355
Hello?

191
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:48,691
Okay-

192
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:51,110
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

193
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:55,240
(slow, ominous music)

194
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:56,616
(popping) Oh.

195
00:09:56,658 --> 00:09:58,159
Oh.

196
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,202
Sorry.

197
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:04,750
(phone ringing)

198
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:07,920
(slow, ominous music)

199
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,180
Thanks.

200
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:22,769
What the hell is wrong with you?

201
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:23,603
What?

202
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:24,437
Did you think he was gonna hack me up

203
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:25,759
into little pieces or something?

204
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:28,233
What can I get for you buddy?

205
00:10:30,403 --> 00:10:31,403
Hey?

206
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:33,154
Hello?

207
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:36,117
(slow, ominous music)

208
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:38,911
If you don't order anything,
you're gonna have to leave.

209
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:42,540
You already have eight likes.

210
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:46,336
Can you hear me in there?

211
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:51,091
Oh god, it's gonna be a long night.

212
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:56,054
(slow, ominous music)

213
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:12,489
(cranking)

214
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:21,999
(slow, ominous music)

215
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:25,501
Aww.

216
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:32,010
(slow, ominous music)
(Dawn giggling)

217
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:33,052
What are you doing?

218
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:39,933
Thanks.

219
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,568
(Dawn chuckling)

220
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,237
Okay, not for nothing,
but that's the nicest thing.

221
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,365
A guy's done for you all night.

222
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:53,783
Seriously?

223
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:54,700
What the fuck?

224
00:11:54,742 --> 00:11:55,826
Here you go ladies.

225
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:58,622
Yes.

226
00:11:58,663 --> 00:11:59,831
You two okay?

227
00:11:59,873 --> 00:12:00,999
Oh, he's harmless.

228
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:02,958
You okay?

229
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:05,796
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

230
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:06,837
Enjoy your pizza.

231
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:12,220
(slow, ominous music)

232
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:25,192
What do you keep staring at?

233
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:26,360
That bag.

234
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:27,736
What do you think is in it?

235
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,448
I don't know, who cares?

236
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,490
Just eat your food.

237
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:37,913
You fuckin' freak!

238
00:12:37,955 --> 00:12:38,747
Get over here.

239
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:41,126
All night with you, you fuck.

240
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:42,167
Enough.

241
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:45,630
(tense, dramatic music)

242
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:47,465
Get outta here.

243
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:51,511
(tense, dramatic music)

244
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:54,515
Take your shit, and don't come back.

245
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:59,270
(tense, dramatic music)

246
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,980
Ramon, grab a mob and some bleach.

247
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:01,814
Eh, you okay?

248
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:03,107
[Man] Yeah, I'm alright.

249
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,945
(slow, ominous music)

250
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:19,666
[Dawn] What do you think
that guy did in there?

251
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,042
[Tara] Who knows.

252
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:22,919
[Dawn] Probably jizzed
all over the place,

253
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:23,880
fucking pervert.

254
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,798
' [Tara] Stop.

255
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,632
What?

256
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:28,777
I'm telling you that guy
totally whacked off in there.

257
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:30,761
He was obviously turned on by you.

258
00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:32,180
You're fuckin' sick.

259
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:33,221
You know that?

260
00:13:34,223 --> 00:13:35,892
(dogs barking)

261
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:37,059
What?

262
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:40,481
- Look at your hand.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

263
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:42,041
Look, at least he had the courtesy to do.

264
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:43,358
Whatever he did in private.

265
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,778
I mean, he could have
whipped it out right there.

266
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,655
I really don't need the visual.

267
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:53,328
[Dawn] Well are you okay to drive?

268
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,914
Yeah, trust me, that
sobered me right the fuck up.

269
00:13:57,165 --> 00:13:58,583
- Oh my god.
- What?

270
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,625
Your tire.

271
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:01,376
Fuck me.

272
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:04,714
Has it been like this the whole time?

273
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,192
I think I would have said
something if I'd noticed.

274
00:14:06,216 --> 00:14:07,968
That your tire had exploded.

275
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,471
Why does this shit always happen to me?

276
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:11,847
[Tara] Do you have a spare?

277
00:14:13,015 --> 00:14:14,016
It's on the car.

278
00:14:15,184 --> 00:14:16,184
Wow.

279
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:20,231
I'm starting to feel sick.

280
00:14:20,272 --> 00:14:22,400
Just, give me your phone.

281
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:23,442
I'll call my sister.

282
00:14:25,153 --> 00:14:27,739
(slow, ominous music)

283
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:29,950
Yo Steve, this is sick.

284
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:32,619
I better get overtime for this.

285
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:34,496
No joke, this is disgusting.

286
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:36,349
You got me cleanin' piss
and shit at one o'clock.

287
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:37,917
In the morning.

288
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,561
Let the guy who handles
food take care of it,

289
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:41,128
Real fuckin' sanitary.

290
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:44,465
Steve, time and a half, or I'm out.

291
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:48,093
You hear me?

292
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:52,558
(rock music)

293
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:57,229
(phone ringing)

294
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,606
Hello?

295
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,691
[Tara] Hi, it's me.

296
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,026
Tara?

297
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,236
Yeah, my phone died.

298
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,114
I'm calling from Dawn's.

299
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:06,906
Ah.

300
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:07,740
Your phone died.

301
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,343
Can you ever go out
without using social media.

302
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,160
Every 30 seconds?

303
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,829
I think you're the only one in America.

304
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,581
Who has that sort of restraint.

305
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,291
Yeah, that's probably right.

306
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,542
[Tara] Did I wake you?

307
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,796
No, I am studying for
my midterm tomorrow.

308
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,089
Oh, shit.

309
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:26,260
Why, what is it?

310
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,262
What is it, Tara?

311
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:30,514
Dawn and I are sort
of stranded right now.

312
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,266
She has a flat tire and no spare.

313
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:34,810
And I was kind of hoping
you could pick us up?

314
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:38,815
I have to be up in five hours, Tara.

315
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:39,858
Yeah, I know Vic.

316
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,401
Don't bother, seriously.

317
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:43,028
I didn't realize you had a test.

318
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:46,656
(laughing)

319
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:49,491
Sorry.

320
00:15:50,703 --> 00:15:52,997
I didn't know you were here.

321
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:56,334
(rock music)

322
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:02,131
You know what?

323
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:03,942
I gotta stretch my legs
and besides, if I fail,

324
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:05,552
I can always blame you.

325
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:07,888
You are the best sister in the world.

326
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:11,182
Yeah.

327
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:14,101
Where are you?

328
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,241
What's wrong?

329
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:29,994
I'm fine.

330
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:31,371
Why?

331
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:34,541
You keep looking over your shoulder.

332
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:37,503
Just thinking.

333
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:38,544
About?

334
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:40,755
Nothing.

335
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:42,674
Tell me.

336
00:16:45,552 --> 00:16:47,513
What if that guy did this to your car?

337
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:49,599
What guy?

338
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,475
The clown?

339
00:16:50,517 --> 00:16:51,518
[Tara] I'm serious.

340
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:56,272
Well, you really think
someone slashed my tires?

341
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:59,859
Well, he knows this is your car.

342
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:01,736
He saw us getting into it earlier.

343
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:03,280
That's fucking ridiculous.

344
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,908
I probably just ran over
a nail or something.

345
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,346
I should have just let you drive.

346
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,373
Yeah, you should have.

347
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:15,376
But as usual, you have
to be the good Samaritan

348
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:16,502
so here we are.

349
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:17,587
Stuck.

350
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:19,423
Like a couple of assholes.

351
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:23,677
(chuckling)

352
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:26,847
(slow, ominous music)

353
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:33,895
Steve!

354
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:38,192
(slow, ominous music)

355
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,752
(dramatic music)

356
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:55,793
Oh fuck!

357
00:17:56,754 --> 00:18:00,048
(tense, dramatic music)

358
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:05,930
Help!

359
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:10,185
Somebody! (Phone ringing)

360
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:11,436
(tense, dramatic music)

361
00:18:11,478 --> 00:18:13,772
(screaming)

362
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:17,985
(tense, dramatic music)

363
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:24,742
(stabbing)

364
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:25,576
(gasping)

365
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:28,412
Yeah, but what if I'm right,

366
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:31,208
And he's out there watching us right now?

367
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:32,501
(gasping)

368
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:34,711
Show him your tits.

369
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:36,755
I don't know, Tara.

370
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:38,757
Look, that guy was harmless.

371
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,135
He's just some douche bag in a costume.

372
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:45,056
Acting like a retard
because it's Halloween.

373
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:49,435
(stabbing) (yelling)

374
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:50,436
No.

375
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:51,478
He was different.

376
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,649
(stabbing) (yelling)

377
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,566
He smiled.

378
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:58,444
The way he kept staring at
us with those dead eyes.

379
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:01,114
(stabbing)

380
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,699
What was in that bag?

381
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,328
(tense, dramatic music)

382
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,913
I don't know, Tara.

383
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:10,165
The point is, he's gone,

384
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,750
And you're never gonna see him again.

385
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:15,922
So cut the shit, 'cause you're
starting to freak me out.

386
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:33,232
I really have to pee.

387
00:19:33,274 --> 00:19:34,274
So go.

388
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,569
Go?

389
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,403
Go where?

390
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:38,821
It's the middle of the night.

391
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:41,156
I can't just pop a squat
in the middle of the street.

392
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:42,408
And pee like you do.

393
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,578
Well tough shit, because
it's gonna be a while.

394
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,830
Before your sister gets here.

395
00:19:46,872 --> 00:19:47,872
Fuck.

396
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,836
(deeply exhaling)

397
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,346
Maybe that guy has a
bathroom that you can use.

398
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:03,598
Who?

399
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,142
That creepy guy who just got out of that.

400
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:08,185
Even creepier looking building.

401
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:11,022
Tara.

402
00:20:11,063 --> 00:20:12,356
I was kidding.

403
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,650
Excuse me?

404
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:16,528
Yes?

405
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,362
I'm sorry to bother you.

406
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:19,781
Is there a bathroom in there I could use?

407
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:21,283
Sorry, I don't own the place.

408
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:22,802
I'm not supposed to let anyone in here.

409
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:24,536
Please, mister, it's an emergency.

410
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:25,871
I'll be two seconds.

411
00:20:25,913 --> 00:20:28,207
Honestly, I could get
in a lot of trouble.

412
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:29,250
Who's gonna know?

413
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:32,211
[Dawn] Just let her use
the bathroom, for god sakes.

414
00:20:32,253 --> 00:20:33,963
She'll make it worth your while.

415
00:20:35,757 --> 00:20:37,008
A friend of yours?

416
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,385
Yeah, I'm sorry, she's drunk.

417
00:20:40,553 --> 00:20:43,223
It's been a long night.

418
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:44,224
Alright.

419
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:45,768
Just make it quick, okay?

420
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:46,809
Thank you.

421
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:51,607
Guy's even weirder
looking than the clown was.

422
00:20:57,197 --> 00:20:58,197
This way.

423
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:02,887
Good thing you called me when I did.

424
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:05,413
I was about to bomb the
hell out of this place.

425
00:21:05,455 --> 00:21:06,289
Bomb?

426
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,415
Bug bomb.

427
00:21:07,457 --> 00:21:08,457
Pest control.

428
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:10,293
What kind of pest?

429
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,730
You sure you want me to tell you before

430
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:12,922
you use the bathroom?

431
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:13,756
Why?

432
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:14,966
Don't tell me it's roaches.

433
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:15,967
It's not roaches.

434
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:16,801
Oh good.

435
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:17,842
[Mike] It's rats.

436
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:20,053
Rats?

437
00:21:20,972 --> 00:21:23,265
(toilet flushing)

438
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:24,307
All clear.

439
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:26,061
Are you sure?

440
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:27,270
Rat free.

441
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:29,982
What if one crawls out of the toilet?

442
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:32,526
I'd make it quick if I were you.

443
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:33,567
Good plan.

444
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,990
Do you need me to wait for you or?

445
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:39,491
I'll be alright.

446
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:41,953
[Mike] You remember how we came in?

447
00:21:41,995 --> 00:21:42,995
I remember.

448
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,206
Okay.

449
00:21:45,248 --> 00:21:48,126
Well, um, you have a nice night then.

450
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:49,544
You too.

451
00:21:49,585 --> 00:21:50,585
Thanks again.

452
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:52,629

You don't have to say a word.

Your eyes tell me everything.

503
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,111
I didn't mean to frighten you, dear.

504
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,447

It's been quite a while
since we've had neighbors.

511
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:58,810
Perhaps we can do our laundry together.

512
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,728
I could use some good company.

513
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:03,607
Yes.

514
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:05,067

515
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:09,822

You have to come with me now.

If you don't go away right
now, I'm gonna call the cops.

Yes, that's what I've been saying.

690

You need to call the
police right away because

691
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:23,532
he's right downstairs
and he's probably going

692
00:47:23,556 --> 00:47:25,350

you don't get somebody

693
00:47:25,391 --> 00:47:26,267

funny because he's laughing.

698
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,693
But I know it's not funny
because they're all dead.

699
00:47:34,735 --> 00:47:36,236
Get the hell away from me.

700

He knows I know, and he's
gonna try and kill me.

702
00:47:40,616 --> 00:47:42,076
Before he kills you.

703
00:47:42,117 --> 00:47:43,535

For how long.

939
01:10:32,622 --> 01:10:34,058
[Operator] Where is the assailant now?

940
01:10:34,082 --> 01:10:35,291
I knocked him out.

941
01:10:36,209 --> 01:10:39,421
If this guy wakes up,
we are not safe here.

942
01:10:39,463 --> 01:10:42,800
This guy is armed and he's
a total fucking maniac.

943
01:10:43,926 --> 01:10:45,612
[Operator] Okay, sir,
what I want you to do now

944
01:10:45,636 --> 01:10:47,930
is just remain calm and
stay on the line with me.

945
01:10:47,972 --> 01:10:49,181
Until the police arrive.

946
01:10:50,224 --> 01:10:51,016
Look.

947
01:10:51,058 --> 01:10:51,852
We are not staying here.

948
01:10:51,893 --> 01:10:53,687
I'm taking this girl
to the emergency room.

949
01:10:53,728 --> 01:10:55,981
You just get your asses down here now.

950
01:10:58,150 --> 01:10:58,942
I got my truck outside.

951
01:10:58,984 --> 01:11:00,169
Can you walk?
(Victoria mumbling)

952
01:11:00,193 --> 01:11:01,486
Okay-

953
01:11:01,528 --> 01:11:04,739
Come on, let's get out of here.

954
01:11:04,781 --> 01:11:08,077

955
01:11:14,584 --> 01:11:15,584
Dammit!

957
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000

Get away from me!

01:13:40,323 --> 01:13:41,532
Leave me alone!

981
01:13:42,491 --> 01:13:44,035
You fucking maniac!

01:13:45,578 --> 01:13:49,166
Leave me alone!
(bike horn honking)

983
01:13:49,207 --> 01:13:50,334
Stop, stop it!

Police, don't fuckin' move!

1001

Put your hands up right now!

1002
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,473

Let me see your hands!

1006
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:03,809
Send more units.

1007
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:04,953
I said show me your hands!

1008
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:05,895
Put 'em up!

1009
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,563

(police sirens wailing)

1011

[Police Officer On The Left]
That's it, nice and easy.

1012
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,614
No sudden moves.

1013
01:16:15,655 --> 01:16:16,698
Your right hand.

1014
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:17,657
Show me the right hand.

1015
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:18,492
Last warning.

1016
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:19,659
You're gonna get shot!

1017
01:16:22,496 --> 01:16:25,874
(tense, dramatic music)

1018
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:29,920
Do it!

(tense, dramatic music)

1022
01:16:43,977 --> 01:16:47,397
Central, we got shots fired.

1023
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:48,649
Multiple causalities.

1024
01:16:49,983 --> 01:16:53,320
We needed buses and immediate assistance.

1025
01:16:53,362 --> 01:16:56,573
(police radio chatter)

1026
01:16:58,117 --> 01:16:59,428
[Police Officer On The Left] Oh my god.

1027
01:16:59,452 --> 01:17:00,452
What?

1028
01:17:01,329 --> 01:17:04,207
(Victoria gasping)

1029
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:05,875
She's still alive.

(police radio chatter)
(sirens wailing)

1031
01:17:30,402 --> 01:17:31,319
Aw, come on, guys.

1032
01:17:31,361 --> 01:17:32,571
You're killin' me.

1033
01:17:32,612 --> 01:17:34,948
The revolving doors won't
be installed until Monday.

1034
01:17:35,865 --> 01:17:37,200
Good to see you, too, doc.

1035
01:17:39,828 --> 01:17:41,265
[Coroner] Okay, what
are you bringing me?

1036
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:43,249
Murder, suicide.

1037
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,500
Wonderful.

1038
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:46,294
What's behind showcase number one?

1039
01:17:46,335 --> 01:17:47,795
Severe head trauma.

1040
01:17:47,837 --> 01:17:49,064
You're probably gonna have to identify

1041
01:17:49,088 --> 01:17:51,215
this poor bastard by his teeth,

1042
01:17:51,257 --> 01:17:53,467
If you can dig them out
of the back of his skull.

1043
01:17:53,509 --> 01:17:55,846
So I should put on a seventh
pot of coffee, then, huh?

1044
01:17:55,887 --> 01:17:57,323
You're gonna need
something a lot stronger

1045
01:17:57,347 --> 01:17:58,307
than coffee.

1046
01:17:58,348 --> 01:18:00,976
Landon said they just
found two more bodies.

1047
01:18:01,018 --> 01:18:03,437
Jesus, they get the sick
fuck that's doing this?

1048
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:04,646
Showcase number two.

1049
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:08,400
No shit.

1050
01:18:08,442 --> 01:18:10,170
Police found him eating
the face off of some.

1051
01:18:10,194 --> 01:18:13,156
Young girl after he ran
her over with a truck.

1052
01:18:13,197 --> 01:18:17,535
He blew his brains out before
they could take him in, so.

1053
01:18:17,577 --> 01:18:19,245
Halloween never disappoints, does it?

1054
01:18:19,287 --> 01:18:21,372
And it looks like it's
just getting started.

1055
01:18:21,414 --> 01:18:22,641
Well, seeing as how I'm gonna be here

1056
01:18:22,665 --> 01:18:24,835
for another 24 hours, thanks to you,

1057
01:18:25,753 --> 01:18:27,522
you guys think you could
get me a breakfast sandwich.

1058
01:18:27,546 --> 01:18:29,590
With bacon, or something with bacon?

1059
01:18:29,632 --> 01:18:30,633
Bacon, really?

1060
01:18:31,634 --> 01:18:33,361
I thought you were
watching your cholesterol.

1061
01:18:33,385 --> 01:18:34,637
I am watchin' it.

1062
01:18:34,678 --> 01:18:35,971
Watchin' it go up.

1063
01:18:36,013 --> 01:18:37,389
Who's the MD around here?

1064
01:18:37,431 --> 01:18:39,112
How can you eat a greasy croissant while.

1065
01:18:39,142 --> 01:18:41,019
You're cutting up dead bodies?

1066
01:18:41,061 --> 01:18:42,020
Sweetheart.

1067
01:18:42,062 --> 01:18:42,228
I've been doin' this 22 years.

1068
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:44,064
I've been doin this 22 years.

1069
01:18:44,105 --> 01:18:45,374
Alright, once you've
seen an eight month old

1070
01:18:45,398 --> 01:18:46,399
microwaved to death,

1071
01:18:48,318 --> 01:18:49,903
Everything else is just old hat.

1072
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,908
Look, you had to ask, alright?

1073
01:18:53,949 --> 01:18:55,576
I'll hook you up, doc.

1074
01:18:55,618 --> 01:18:56,618
That's my GUY-

1075
01:18:58,204 --> 01:18:59,830
Stay safe out there.

1076
01:19:01,457 --> 01:19:04,752

(tense, dramatic music)

1079
01:19:22,187 --> 01:19:25,566
Let's have a look at the man of the hour.

1080
01:19:28,027 --> 01:19:31,322
(tense, dramatic music)

1081
01:19:36,369 --> 01:19:38,247
I hope your 15 minutes
of fame was worth it,

1082
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You sick son of a bitch.

1083
01:19:47,089 --> 01:19:51,218
(dramatic music)
(lights flicking)

1084
01:19:54,472 --> 01:19:57,100
(phone ringing)

1085
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:02,063
[Woman] You're really
going to like it here.

1086
01:20:02,105 --> 01:20:04,733
(phone ringing)

1087
01:20:05,692 --> 01:20:07,987

(coroner screaming)

1091
01:20:36,684 --> 01:20:39,854
(tense, dramatic music)

1092
01:20:47,153 --> 01:20:48,821
Thanks again for everything, doctor.

1093
01:20:48,863 --> 01:20:50,281
You'll be in our prayers.

1094
01:20:50,323 --> 01:20:52,451
Please, don't mention it.

1095
01:20:52,493 --> 01:20:54,077
We're all gonna miss this one.

1096
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:55,621
She's been so cooperative.

1097
01:20:55,662 --> 01:20:57,414
Makes everyone laugh.

1098
01:20:57,456 --> 01:20:58,248
(laughs)

1099
01:20:58,290 --> 01:20:59,124
Well she certainly hasn't
lost her sense of humor.

1100
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:00,918
Yeah, still a wise ass.

1101
01:21:01,835 --> 01:21:02,628
It's good.

1102
01:21:02,669 --> 01:21:04,046
It's a good thing.

1103
01:21:04,087 --> 01:21:05,799
It's important to stay positive, right?

1104
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,091
Absolutely.

1105
01:21:07,133 --> 01:21:08,259
Good spirits.

1106
01:21:08,301 --> 01:21:09,301
She'll be fine.

1107
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:12,347
Well, take care of yourself, Victoria.

1108
01:21:12,388 --> 01:21:13,741
I'll see you in a couple of months.

1109
01:21:13,765 --> 01:21:14,641
[Victoria] Thank you, doctor.

1110

So long, doctor.

Good bye.

01:21:20,523 --> 01:21:22,233
What do you say kiddo?

1114
01:21:22,274 --> 01:21:23,067
You ready?

1115
01:21:23,108 --> 01:21:24,108
[Victoria] Yep.

1116
01:21:25,778 --> 01:21:26,963
[Doctor] Oh and, uh, good luck with

1117
01:21:26,987 --> 01:21:28,155
