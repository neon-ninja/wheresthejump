00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:55,470
Oh, what up. Look at you two!

3
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:58,908
All right! Yeah! Yeah.

4
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:04,713
Hey!

5
00:01:05,014 --> 00:01:05,982
Drink!

6
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:07,150
You lost!

7
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:08,951
Okay, cheers. Chicks.

8
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:12,121
Kate, it's your turn.

9
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:14,090
Should I text her?

10
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:17,492
Liz Murphy needs to stop
posting pics of her food.

11
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:19,661
We get it, Liz, you're vegan.

12
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:21,264
I don't know.
I was thinking of trying it.

13
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:23,732
Not me. I like to eat
what I want when I want.

14
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,467
Isn't that how you get fat?

15
00:01:26,068 --> 00:01:30,239
Too many calories is how you get
fat, and I never go over 1,200. See?

16
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:32,208
I need that.
What's that called?

17
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,144
"Countdown to Skinny." It's so good.
It totally works.

18
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:36,979
Are we not playing
the game anymore?

19
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:38,580
Is it this one?

20
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:41,050
No. That's weird.
What is that?

21
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,788
"If you could know exactly when you were
going to die, would you want to know?"

22
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:46,823
That's creepy.

23
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:48,590
- That's literally all it says.
- Awesome!

24
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:51,526
Okay, new game.
Let's all download it,

25
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,797
and whoever is gonna die first has to
finish all the drinks on the table.

26
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:56,833
- I'm in.
- All right. I'm so down.

27
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:58,567
I'm out.
I'm not messing with that.

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,137
Don't be such
a little beyotch.

29
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,604
It's just an app.

30
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:05,507
Okay.

31
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:11,513
- It's this app?
- Mm-hmm.

32
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:13,049
One second.

33
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:20,056
- Everybody ready?
- Let's do it.

34
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:22,691
- Mm-hmm.
- I got 63 years.

35
00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:24,160
Oh!

36
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:26,095
Nice. Mine says 32.

37
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,898
I got 22 years. YOLO!

38
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:30,365
What's yours say, Court?

39
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:34,237
Court?

40
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:39,507
Um, it says I only have
three hours to live.

41
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:42,778
You're gonna die!

42
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:43,980
Oh!

43
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:46,481
You lost! Drink up.

44
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:49,185
- Oh, my God. Evan, get over here.
- What?

45
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:51,419
We downloaded an app that
tells us when we're gonna die.

46
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:53,122
Look at your girlfriend's.

47
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:56,391
- Why would you download that?
- I don't know. We all were.

48
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:57,860
You better not kill
my best friend.

49
00:02:58,693 --> 00:02:59,829
You guys are ridiculous.

50
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,297
- Drink up, Court.
- Yeah. Yeah.

51
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:02,999
- You lost.
- What?

52
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:05,268
- You did lose a bet, so you gotta drink.
- Chug! Come on, Court.

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,969
These are all full.
Are you kidding me?

54
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,070
I got you, babe.

55
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:09,272
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

56
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:11,406
Look at that.
Chivalry is not dead.

57
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:13,309
- Lighten up.
- Yeah. I'll go.

58
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:14,744
It was Kate's...

59
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:27,123
Oh!

60
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:35,064
Babe, you can't drive.
You're wasted.

61
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:38,134
You know I
drive way better when I'm drunk.

62
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:39,936
That's not funny.

63
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:41,037
I'm kidding.

64
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:43,438
Let's just walk to my house.

65
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:45,408
Oh, my God.

66
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,244
Please don't tell me you're still
worried about that stupid app.

67
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:51,781
Baby, I swear,
I'm not gonna kill you.

68
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:52,815
I know.

69
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:57,219
Come on.
Let's leave the car here.

70
00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:00,189
I hate when you do this.

71
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,928
Okay. You know what?
Fine. I'll walk by myself.

72
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:10,933
Courtney. Courtney, come on.

73
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:16,939
Courtney, come on! I'm fine!
Get in the car!

74
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:18,540
Please don't do this.

75
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:20,142
I told you I'm walking.

76
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:21,777
Fine. Whatever!

77
00:04:35,657 --> 00:04:36,826
Stupid thing.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

79
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:11,053
Stop!

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

81
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

82
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:29,225
Thank you.

83
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:33,929
- Not bad.
- Yeah.

84
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:38,733
Quinn,
can you take over this IV?

85
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:40,202
Oh, sure.

86
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,938
Don't worry.
She's one of our best interns.

87
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,035
Hey. I told you
you can't keep coming in here.

88
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:15,738
There's asbestos and lead,
and God knows what.

89
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:17,706
Just one more minute, please?

90
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,210
Okay. Fine. Just one minute.

91
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:25,881
Just so you know, if something in
here kills me, I am haunting you.

92
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,820
It's normal to be nervous.
Surgery can be scary.

93
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:34,423
But you're gonna be fine,
I promise.

94
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:36,058
It's not that.

95
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:37,993
I mean, it is that, but...

96
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,964
Forget it.
You'll think I'm a psycho.

97
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:43,966
Ooh. Now you have to tell me.

98
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:47,303
Can't just dangle the word
"psycho" and not tell me.

99
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:52,308
I don't get it.

100
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,643
It's an app that tells you
when you're gonna die.

101
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,111
Dude, seriously?

102
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:58,881
I know. I said the same thing.

103
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,518
But it knew
we were gonna crash.

104
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,887
Wait, there was someone else
in the car with you?

105
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,723
No, she didn't get in, um,

106
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:10,826
because that app said she was
gonna die in nine minutes,

107
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,930
and nine minutes later I crashed my car
and a tree branch went through her seat.

108
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:20,402
So, you feel
like she would have died.

109
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,639
But she didn't, right?
What does that tell you about your app?

110
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:24,907
She did die.

111
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:27,910
She died that same night.

112
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,481
It knew, all right?
It was right about her.

113
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:36,085
And now it's saying that I'm gonna
die during that surgery, so...

114
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,821
Listen to me.
You're smart enough to know

115
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,856
that this app was made by some
loser in his parents' basement

116
00:10:40,989 --> 00:10:42,157
trying to scare people.

117
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:47,196
Come on.

118
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,898
Your minute's up.

119
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,937
Evan.
I told you that's off-limits.

120
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,338
You can't keep
going back there.

121
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:57,706
He knows.

122
00:10:57,841 --> 00:10:59,743
He just needed
a minute to himself.

123
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,710
Mm-hmm.

124
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:02,911
Follow me.

125
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,881
Shit.

126
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,718
Surprise!

127
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:11,220
We heard you passed your test.

128
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:13,555
You're officially one of us.

129
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:16,058
- One of us. One of us.
- Okay. Okay.

130
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:17,526
- Freaks.
- You're a freak.

131
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:18,927
Oh, my God.

132
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:20,929
- Thank you.
- You earned it.

133
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:24,166
Is that slice number three?

134
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:24,967
Yep.

135
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,735
So you want diabetes, then?

136
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,904
My grandfather drank
two cases of Coke a week,

137
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:30,672
and he lived to 94.
So, I'm good.

138
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:33,575
You know, there's an app for that,
in case you wanna know for sure.

139
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,512
Did the kid in 237
show you that, too?

140
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:38,247
Why would anyone wanna know
when they're gonna die?

141
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,215
I wanna know.
What's it called?

142
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:41,550
Countdown, I think.

143
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:43,719
I don't think God
intends us to know that.

144
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,220
God has a plan for all of us.

145
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:47,589
It's not really our place
to question when.

146
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,358
Thank you. It's not natural.

147
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:53,695
Shit! I'm only gonna make it
to 87. Got robbed, kid.

148
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,030
I'm gonna send it to you guys.

149
00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:56,465
I don't want that on my phone.

150
00:11:56,598 --> 00:12:00,536
Fifty-seven years.
That'll make me... 98.

151
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:02,137
- That's bullshit!
- Is it?

152
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:03,740
I ran six miles this morning.
How many did you run?

153
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:07,109
Zero. But I'm still gonna
make it to 87. So, I win.

154
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:08,477
Ah.

155
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,446
Help! I need help.

156
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:11,947
- Hey, easy, easy.
- Back up, back up.

157
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,482
- What did she take?
- I don't know.

158
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:15,017
- How long has she been like this?
- I don't know.

159
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,685
Let's get
two milligrams of Narcan.

160
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,487
Quinn, grab me the OPRK.

161
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,123
Please. Come on, please.

162
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:25,594
- What is that?
- It's gonna counteract the drugs.

163
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:27,864
As long as
she's not too far gone.

164
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:29,631
- Come on, baby.
- Come on.

165
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:32,034
Hey, if you're gonna do it,
do it now.

166
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:33,635
- Okay. Here we go.
- Check. Check.

167
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:38,707
Come on. Come on.
It's coming. It's coming.

168
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,777
There you go. There she is.

169
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,179
Easy, easy, easy.
There you go.

170
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:47,115
Easy. Welcome back.
We got cake for you.

171
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:49,618
Easy. You're gonna be okay.

172
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:51,987
There you go. Easy, easy.

173
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:49,511
You won't be needing this student
badge anymore, Nurse Harris.

174
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:50,847
Thanks.

175
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:53,983
So, where do you wanna continue
the celebration tonight?

176
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:56,753
Oh. I can't.

177
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,521
I just really wanna finish
my paperwork.

178
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:01,423
But rain check.

179
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,258
I'm proud of you.

180
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,098
Gonna hold you
to that rain check.

181
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,545
<i>Hey, Scott.</i>

182
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:26,114
Quick question. I'm just
trying to fill out my I-9.

183
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:28,650
What do I do
if I don't have a passport?

184
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,821
<i>Just use your birth certificate.
You have that, right?</i>

185
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:35,892
No. But I think I know where it is.
Hey, Can I call you back?

186
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:37,459
- <i>Yeah, sure.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

187
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:44,433
Shit.

188
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:22,832
Jesus. Jordan!

189
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,902
- You scared the crap out of me!
- Shh. You're gonna wake Dad.

190
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,804
What the hell
are you doing in a closet?

191
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,374
This is Joe.

192
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:34,476
You wanna put a shirt on, Joe?

193
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:37,345
Very much so.

194
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,620
Hmm. I think I should go.

195
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:46,989
I think that's a good idea.

196
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:48,290
It was really nice meeting...

197
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:53,462
You shouldn't have boys
coming over.

198
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,397
You can't tell me what to do.

199
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,133
You're not Mom.

200
00:16:57,265 --> 00:17:00,235
Well, if I was, you wouldn't even
think about pulling this shit.

201
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:01,938
What are you
even doing here, Quinn?

202
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:03,973
I had to come home
to grab some stuff for work.

203
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,441
And let me guess.
Now that you have it, you're leaving?

204
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,645
See you in another
six months, then. Cool.

205
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,280
Jordan.

206
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:16,551
- Jordan.
- Go away.

207
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:19,856
I got some good news today.

208
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:22,191
I'm officially a nurse.

209
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:24,426
- Good for you.
- Quinny Bear?

210
00:17:25,393 --> 00:17:27,063
Is everything okay?

211
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:29,464
It's fine. I'm sorry, Dad.
I didn't mean to wake you.

212
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:30,767
Hey, come here.

213
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:35,370
You hungry? You want me
to heat you something up?

214
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:38,573
I'm okay. I'm actually headed out.
I have a really early morning.

215
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:41,911
Hey. If you have any time
on Saturday,

216
00:17:42,044 --> 00:17:44,847
we're gonna go lay some fresh
flowers up on your ma's grave.

217
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,348
Um...

218
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:49,718
Okay. Sure. Sounds nice.

219
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:52,054
Great. All right.
We'll pick you up Saturday.

220
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:53,421
- Okay.
- Okay.

221
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:56,525
- All right.
- Bye, Dad.

222
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,194
- See you. I love you, sweetie.
- Love you.

223
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:02,965
Hello?

224
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:06,601
Okay. Two-minute warning.

225
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:09,738
So, if you need to
use the bathroom, use it now.

226
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:12,809
You'd be surprised how many people
say, "I'm good,"

227
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:15,144
and then it's cleanup
on aisle five.

228
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:20,582
You need any help?

229
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:22,484
No, I got it.

230
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:25,420
All right. I'll be right back.

231
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,558
No freaking way.

232
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:34,230
Hey. I'm at work.
Can I call you back?

233
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:35,664
Okay. Bye.

234
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

235
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:37,425
What the hell?

236
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Courtney?
Court?

237
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

238
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:45,493
Hey. What's going on?

239
00:20:45,627 --> 00:20:47,430
There was an accident.

240
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:50,066
The patient died in a stairwell.
They think he might have jumped.

241
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,200
Who was it?

242
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,868
The kid from 237.

243
00:20:53,803 --> 00:20:55,603
- Evan?
- Yeah.

244
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:01,043
You okay?

245
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,078
Yeah.

246
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:03,179
Um...

247
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,916
Have they packed up
his room yet?

248
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:11,420
- Hey, Rach.
- Nurse Amy needs to see you.

249
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:13,189
She just told me
to do this room.

250
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:15,992
It's okay, I'll take care of it.
You should go see what she wants.

251
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,059
All right. Thanks.

252
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:18,547
Hey, Quinny.

253
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,284
Hey, Dad. So, um, you know,
this thing on Saturday,

254
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:25,488
I checked with the hospital,
and it turns out I do have to work.

255
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,456
That's okay.
You know, work's important.

256
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,091
We can go
another weekend, right?

257
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:30,860
Yeah. In fact,
this works out great.

258
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,828
Your uncle, Doug,
he's crewing up for a job upstate.

259
00:23:32,962 --> 00:23:34,629
It's good overtime.

260
00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:36,832
- <i>We'll do it when I come back.</i>
- Okay. Thanks, Dad. Love you.

261
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:37,967
I love you too, Quinny.

262
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,435
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

263
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:40,903
No personal calls
when you're on the clock.

264
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:42,371
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

265
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:43,638
Better not.

266
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:14,603
Sorry.

267
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:16,005
I didn't mean to scare you.

268
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:18,007
Ms. Thompson's IV drip
stopped.

269
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,707
- Mind taking a look?
- Of course.

270
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,451
This poor lady's
been in a coma for weeks.

271
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:32,454
I know. It's sad.

272
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:35,257
I think the IV pump
just needs to be reset.

273
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:38,060
Shit.

274
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:39,862
- You all right there, kiddo?
- Yeah.

275
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,402
Actually, no.

276
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:48,003
Hey, hey, hey.

277
00:24:49,505 --> 00:24:50,906
Hey. It's okay.

278
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,908
- It's okay. Talk to me.
- No.

279
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:54,176
What's the matter?
What happened?

280
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,611
It's nothing.
I'm just having a bad day.

281
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,112
I'm sorry.

282
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,848
First day as an RN,
and I'm already messing up.

283
00:24:59,982 --> 00:25:01,884
Hey. Look at me.

284
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:03,986
You are an incredible nurse.

285
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,621
Okay?

286
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:07,823
You're smart. You're driven.

287
00:25:07,957 --> 00:25:10,659
Every time you walk into a patient's
room, you make them smile.

288
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:13,429
That's a gift, okay?

289
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:14,496
Come here.

290
00:25:17,866 --> 00:25:18,968
First days are hard.

291
00:25:20,803 --> 00:25:22,104
I should get back to work.

292
00:25:23,172 --> 00:25:25,140
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Sorry.

293
00:25:28,877 --> 00:25:32,548
- Quinn? Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

294
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:35,918
Remember the recommendation letter you
asked me to write for your license?

295
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:38,187
- Yeah.
- I gushed about you.

296
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:43,225
I really wanna kiss you
right now.

297
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,494
Oh, I don't think
that's appropriate.

298
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,663
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

299
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:51,000
Look. Nobody has to know,
okay? It could be our secret.

300
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,702
Quinn, you like
to help people, right?

301
00:25:53,836 --> 00:25:55,070
Maybe we could help
each other.

302
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:57,339
- I'm really not comfortable.
- Look. Let's...

303
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,874
No! I said no!

304
00:25:59,008 --> 00:25:59,775
Get off of me!

305
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:01,510
Stop it!

306
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,313
Jesus Christ, Quinn.
What the hell is wrong with you?

307
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:06,315
I mean, come on.
I see the way you look at me.

308
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:08,050
What are you,
some kind of tease?

309
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:11,553
Look...

310
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:13,822
I'm sorry.

311
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:17,192
I thought...

312
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:20,796
That was really
unprofessional. I apologize.

313
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:22,331
Okay?

314
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:25,301
Let's just get back
to work, okay?

315
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,505
Sure.

316
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,911
Hey, Nurse Amy?

317
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,579
Yes, Quinn.

318
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:39,615
Can I talk to you for a sec?

319
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:43,152
Amy, I need an updated
vitals check on Mrs. Klein.

320
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:45,354
- I'll be right there in a second.
- This is important.

321
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:47,523
Nurse Amy. Now, please.

322
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:49,291
Quinn, can we talk
about this some other time?

323
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,162
<i>Okay, you guys,
this Countdown app thing,</i>

324
00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:02,531
<i>I'm starting to hear things
and see things.</i>

325
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:05,367
<i>Like, last night,
I saw my cousin</i>

326
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:07,569
<i>who died in April.</i>

327
00:28:07,703 --> 00:28:09,839
<i>I saw him,
and he started talking to me.</i>

328
00:28:09,972 --> 00:28:11,540
<i>I know it's real,</i>

329
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:13,942
<i>and it's toying with me
and it's playing with me.</i>

330
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:17,079
<i>And it's playing this game of
cat and mouse, and I can feel it.</i>

331
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:19,615
<i>And it's like it's
feeding off of my fears.</i>

332
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:21,483
<i>My time is up.</i>

333
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:23,986
<i>And it feels...</i>

334
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:28,792
<i>Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.</i>

335
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,058
<i>It's here! It's here!</i>

336
00:28:30,192 --> 00:28:31,293
<i>Help! Help!</i>

337
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

338
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

339
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,790
Quinn! What are you doing?

340
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,792
Did you get evicted
or something?

341
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:18,400
Jordan, hang on.
Wait a second.

342
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:21,069
I can't believe you got that
freaked out by a cockroach.

343
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:22,704
Where is it? In the kitchen?

344
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,742
Oh, my God.

345
00:30:26,308 --> 00:30:28,443
What the hell did you do
to your phone?

346
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:30,747
Oh. I, um...

347
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:32,815
I dropped it.

348
00:30:32,949 --> 00:30:34,616
From where, a plane?

349
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:38,253
You have a notification from
something called "Countdown."

350
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:40,790
It says you only have
one day left.

351
00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:42,724
One day until what?

352
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:44,293
Nothing.

353
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,763
Okay.
Why are you acting so weird?

354
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,865
Why aren't you in school?

355
00:30:48,998 --> 00:30:50,632
Dad went on his work trip.

356
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,735
And since it's your fault I'm
stuck being babysat by Mrs. Talbot,

357
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,737
I thought I could stay here.

358
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,174
Oh, Jordan,
now is not a good time.

359
00:30:59,308 --> 00:31:01,878
"If you could know
exactly when you're gonna die,

360
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:03,178
would you wanna know?"

361
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:05,714
Oh, my God.

362
00:31:05,848 --> 00:31:08,350
Is that why you've been acting
like such a freak show?

363
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:10,820
Because an app told you
you only have one day to live?

364
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:13,555
No. It's fake, obviously.

365
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:14,523
Well, I wanna know.

366
00:31:15,557 --> 00:31:16,826
Don't!

367
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,594
What is your problem?

368
00:31:18,727 --> 00:31:21,296
I'm sorry you're stuck with Mrs.
Talbot, but you can't stay here.

369
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,664
Come on.
I never ask for anything.

370
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,867
I told you,
it's just not a good time.

371
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:26,668
God. Ever since Mom died,

372
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,005
you've really sucked
in the big sister department.

373
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,274
Don't do that. Don't try to make
me feel bad to get what you want.

374
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:35,711
Just so you know, whatever you thought
Joe and I were doing the other night,

375
00:31:35,845 --> 00:31:37,880
we're definitely
gonna be doing it tonight.

376
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:46,823
Ah!

377
00:31:48,091 --> 00:31:49,291
Next.

378
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:52,260
My phone just quit working.

379
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:55,197
I can't imagine why.
You always put it down with such grace?

380
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,498
What do we use it for,
primarily?

381
00:31:56,632 --> 00:31:58,400
Mostly just texting
and Facebook.

382
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:00,435
You have more computing power
in your pocket

383
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:02,270
than NASA did when they put
a man on the moon,

384
00:32:02,404 --> 00:32:04,172
but you use it for
"mostly texting and Facebook."

385
00:32:04,306 --> 00:32:05,875
This is why humanity's doomed.

386
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,410
You know what? I don't need
your smug "tech guy" attitude.

387
00:32:08,543 --> 00:32:09,879
Where's your manager?

388
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,381
I'm gonna go get him.
Just hang on. Hold on.

389
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:14,917
Hello. I'm the manager.
Something I can help you with, miss?

390
00:32:15,051 --> 00:32:16,986
You just lost yourself
a customer, smart-ass.

391
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,554
I did? Do you think I'll be
able to find another one, or...

392
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:20,622
Next!

393
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,558
I need a new phone.

394
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:24,794
Okay. What kind of specs
are you looking for?

395
00:32:24,927 --> 00:32:25,895
These actually just came in.

396
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,195
Yeah. Sure. That one.

397
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:28,530
Okay.

398
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:31,934
If you could just...
wait till I run the card...

399
00:32:32,935 --> 00:32:33,903
All right.

400
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,905
Never mind. I trust you.

401
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:40,843
Something in your eyes says you're
a normal, completely sane person.

402
00:32:40,977 --> 00:32:42,411
Need me to transfer
a SIM card over?

403
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,312
No! I want all new everything.

404
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:46,749
- New phone, new number, new service.
- Okay.

405
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:49,451
Now, off the books, for $100
cash, I could jailbreak it.

406
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:50,753
You can have every app
you'll ever need.

407
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:52,955
No, I just want it
however it comes.

408
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:54,389
Okay.

409
00:32:57,794 --> 00:32:58,694
Here you go.

410
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,139
That's good?

411
00:33:10,272 --> 00:33:11,874
Anything else
I can help you with?

412
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:12,942
No.

413
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,544
Okay.

414
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:17,880
Next.

415
00:33:21,383 --> 00:33:23,618
- What the hell is this?
- What?

416
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:24,887
This app!

417
00:33:25,021 --> 00:33:26,421
Why is it on there?

418
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,792
That's weird. Did you buy it?

419
00:33:30,193 --> 00:33:32,829
When could I have done that?
You literally just turned it on.

420
00:33:32,962 --> 00:33:34,097
Okay. Deep breath.

421
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:37,432
Um...
We'll just delete it. Here.

422
00:33:37,566 --> 00:33:39,568
It won't let you delete it!

423
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:43,906
Just give it to me.

424
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:46,209
All right. We're on Yelp.
Doc's Wireless.

425
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:48,044
Please leave a review.
Appreciate it.

426
00:33:48,177 --> 00:33:50,479
Hey. What app
was she talking about?

427
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:06,294
Hey! Watch where you're going!

428
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:08,396
- Sorry.
- Stupid bitch.

429
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,631
I'm sorry.

430
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

431
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:54,609
You again? Are you an idiot?

432
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,511
Look what you did to my Lexus!

433
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,547
Hey! I'm talking to you!

434
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,416
Hey! Hey!

435
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,985
Let her go.

436
00:35:03,286 --> 00:35:05,955
- What are you gonna do about it?
- What am I gonna do about it?

437
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:08,191
You can leave
and nobody gets hurt.

438
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:11,928
Or you can stick around and find
out that I'm all sorts of crazy.

439
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:14,729
And I mean the type of crazy where
I just found out I'm gonna die,

440
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:16,731
and maybe I feel like
taking a white man with me.

441
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:19,334
So, the choice is yours.
I really don't give a damn.

442
00:35:19,668 --> 00:35:22,671
Relax, man. It was just
a fender bender. Jesus.

443
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:28,044
You okay?

444
00:35:29,278 --> 00:35:30,780
You're seeing stuff too,
aren't you?

445
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,749
So am I.

446
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:41,590
What I wanna know is, why us?

447
00:35:42,158 --> 00:35:43,092
Because we downloaded it.

448
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:44,861
No, that's not it.

449
00:35:44,994 --> 00:35:47,797
Other people download it,
and they find they're living to be 100.

450
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,933
It told me
I violated the user agreement.

451
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,870
Right. You know,
it said the same thing to me.

452
00:35:54,937 --> 00:35:55,972
Did you read it?

453
00:35:56,105 --> 00:35:58,975
The terms and conditions?
Every word.

454
00:35:59,108 --> 00:36:00,076
Really?

455
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:01,376
No.

456
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:04,213
You wanna buy a ticket
to Antarctica? Hmm?

457
00:36:04,347 --> 00:36:06,215
Well, you can't.

458
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:10,552
Because only the government and the
Illuminati have access to Antarctica.

459
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:12,520
See? The sons of bitches!

460
00:36:12,654 --> 00:36:14,257
Okay.
What if we go somewhere else?

461
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:16,959
No, it's okay. There's nowhere
to go back and read it.

462
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:20,662
I think that there's gotta be
something there that could tell us.

463
00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:22,697
You people need to wake up.

464
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:24,466
Because if we go there,

465
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,569
we'll be able to see that Antarctica
is the edge of the flat earth.

466
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:29,537
I guess
anything's possible, Ger.

467
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:32,574
What if there's a way for us to
look at that user agreement again?

468
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:33,910
Hey, track with me.

469
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:36,112
What if we got someone
to download it

470
00:36:36,245 --> 00:36:38,915
just so we could see the
terms, and we don't accept it?

471
00:36:39,048 --> 00:36:40,349
No! That is wrong.

472
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:41,751
Trust me.

473
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,452
Hey, question for you guys.

474
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:48,057
Have any of you heard about this new app
that tells you when you're gonna die?

475
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,759
Sounds like bullshit.

476
00:36:49,892 --> 00:36:52,527
Or maybe that's just
what they want you to think.

477
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:53,896
Anyway, it's called Countdown.

478
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,798
I don't feel good about this.

479
00:36:55,932 --> 00:36:58,566
It's fake.
Like the Holocaust, huh?

480
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,170
Never mind. Go ahead.

481
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:02,171
Thank you.

482
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,843
"Camera. Microphone.
Location."

483
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,678
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine.

484
00:37:12,714 --> 00:37:14,649
"User agreement.
Accept terms and conditions?"

485
00:37:14,784 --> 00:37:16,718
Wait, wait, wait!
Are you crazy?

486
00:37:16,852 --> 00:37:20,122
You should never accept the terms and
conditions without reading them first.

487
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,091
Okay. "User shall use
the application."

488
00:37:22,224 --> 00:37:23,793
Yada, yada, yada.

489
00:37:23,926 --> 00:37:26,929
"User shall accept
the terms of his or her fate.

490
00:37:27,863 --> 00:37:31,733
Any attempt to use information derived
from Countdown to alter the user's fate

491
00:37:31,867 --> 00:37:34,270
will result in
a breach of this agreement."

492
00:37:34,403 --> 00:37:37,139
Accept the terms of our fate.

493
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,342
Hang on.

494
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:42,345
I was supposed to take a train
tomorrow to go see my aunt,

495
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:45,982
but the app said that's when I
was going to die, so I canceled.

496
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,785
I canceled something, too,
a trip with my sister and my dad.

497
00:37:50,419 --> 00:37:53,789
Maybe this is when I was
supposed to actually die.

498
00:37:55,657 --> 00:37:57,393
Gerry, don't agree to that.

499
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,527
Trust me.
You don't wanna know.

500
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:02,597
So, no matter what we do,
we're gonna be dead in a couple of hours.

501
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,667
Well, well, well.

502
00:38:05,801 --> 00:38:09,805
Looks like old Ger Bear's
gonna live to be 91.

503
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:11,073
Figures.

504
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:12,408
Let's go.

505
00:38:12,808 --> 00:38:14,310
I love this app.

506
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,083
<i>Whatever's happening to us,</i>

507
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,286
we think
it's because of this app.

508
00:38:24,754 --> 00:38:26,889
From what I've read online
about hauntings,

509
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:29,191
there are spirits
and then there are...

510
00:38:29,524 --> 00:38:31,093
demons.

511
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:33,561
But I don't know. That's why
I wanted to talk to an expert.

512
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:36,165
Yeah. I mean, it seems
like demon stuff to me.

513
00:38:36,298 --> 00:38:40,535
Well, when we talk about demons,
we're usually speaking metaphorically.

514
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:41,771
Wait a minute.

515
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:43,873
So you don't think demons
are real?

516
00:38:44,874 --> 00:38:46,375
I'm sorry, but no.

517
00:38:46,942 --> 00:38:50,780
Look, this stuff...
It's not really what I do.

518
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:53,983
But I know someone who
might be a little better...

519
00:38:55,384 --> 00:38:56,684
qualified.

520
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:07,363
Hey, Quinn. Can I talk to you
for a second?

521
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:09,631
Right. I wanted to talk to you
about yesterday.

522
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,000
Give me two minutes.

523
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,536
Yeah. Great.

524
00:39:13,668 --> 00:39:16,205
Because I have
all the time in the world.

525
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,576
And now I'm talking to myself.

526
00:39:38,094 --> 00:39:40,196
Uh. Yeah, hey, this one's taken.

527
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:46,869
Yo, buddy, I said this one's
taken. Use another...

528
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:51,941
Hey, kid, use another stall.

529
00:40:19,368 --> 00:40:20,269
You okay in there?

530
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:26,976
Hey, buddy, do you want me
to get you some help?

531
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Matt.

532
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Where is it, Matt? Where is it?

533
00:42:08,043 --> 00:42:11,447
Hey, you all right... Jesus. You're good.

534
00:42:12,414 --> 00:42:13,449
Okay.

535
00:42:14,483 --> 00:42:15,551
Wow.

536
00:42:15,684 --> 00:42:18,220
I haven't worked here that long,

537
00:42:18,354 --> 00:42:20,823
and that Dr. Sullivan
is this integral...

538
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:22,191
Quinn, have a seat.

539
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:26,161
Okay.

540
00:42:27,096 --> 00:42:28,998
This is Dave Andrews from HR,

541
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:31,066
Emily,
our hospital administrator,

542
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,035
and you know Dr. Sullivan.

543
00:42:34,703 --> 00:42:36,205
Dr. Sullivan
told us what happened.

544
00:42:36,338 --> 00:42:37,206
He did?

545
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:38,707
Yes, Quinn.

546
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:44,280
I felt obligated to come clean
and tell them the truth.

547
00:42:45,848 --> 00:42:48,350
This doesn't have to destroy
anyone's life, right?

548
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:50,819
It was a simple
misunderstanding, that's all.

549
00:42:50,953 --> 00:42:52,154
I'm sorry.

550
00:42:53,389 --> 00:42:54,556
Thank you.

551
00:42:55,257 --> 00:42:58,327
But you cornering me
in my office like that,

552
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,529
that wasn't okay.
It needs to be addressed.

553
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:02,298
I cornered you?

554
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,768
Look, you don't
need to be embarrassed.

555
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,936
I'm just trying to stop something
before it escalates, that's all.

556
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,806
Today's world of "he said,
she said," you can't be too cautious.

557
00:43:10,939 --> 00:43:12,908
I have to protect myself
and my practice.

558
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:14,677
And the hospital.

559
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,445
Well, based on
Dr. Sullivan's report,

560
00:43:16,578 --> 00:43:18,580
I've recommended
an immediate suspension.

561
00:43:18,714 --> 00:43:20,115
- What?
- Is that necessary?

562
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:22,284
Can't we just do counseling,
or transfer her...

563
00:43:22,418 --> 00:43:24,920
I don't believe this.
He is the one who cornered me.

564
00:43:25,054 --> 00:43:26,790
What?
I don't get a say in this?

565
00:43:26,922 --> 00:43:29,525
Quinn, if this is true,
why didn't you just come to me right away?

566
00:43:29,658 --> 00:43:32,762
I tried, but that asshole
beat me to it!

567
00:43:32,928 --> 00:43:34,496
We're trying to help you,
Quinn.

568
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,765
Don't make it worse by lying.

569
00:43:35,898 --> 00:43:37,266
Don't touch me!

570
00:43:45,341 --> 00:43:47,343
She seems like
a very unstable young woman.

571
00:43:48,944 --> 00:43:50,045
We're leaving.

572
00:43:54,016 --> 00:43:55,884
Matt, come on.

573
00:43:59,588 --> 00:44:00,923
What's up with you?

574
00:44:02,324 --> 00:44:03,292
Nothing.

575
00:44:22,111 --> 00:44:23,212
Hello?

576
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,815
Hello?

577
00:44:25,948 --> 00:44:27,416
Can we get
some service out here?

578
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:29,853
Yo, will you show
a little bit of respect?

579
00:44:29,985 --> 00:44:31,788
Jesus. Shit!

580
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,356
Shh! Do you hear that?

581
00:44:45,901 --> 00:44:47,536
Hello. Hi.

582
00:44:47,669 --> 00:44:49,806
Hallelujah! I'm starving.

583
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:51,373
You guys got my Grubhub?

584
00:44:52,508 --> 00:44:53,509
No.

585
00:44:53,642 --> 00:44:55,177
No. We just have to ask you
a question.

586
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:57,279
Do you believe in demons?

587
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:00,282
Big time.

588
00:45:00,983 --> 00:45:03,085
Look, I know
how hard this is to believe.

589
00:45:03,218 --> 00:45:05,187
No, no, no.

590
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,723
I mean, yes.
It's hard to believe,

591
00:45:07,857 --> 00:45:09,658
but I want it to be true.

592
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:11,761
I mean, I don't want you guys to...
of course.

593
00:45:11,895 --> 00:45:13,562
But demons, whoo!

594
00:45:13,695 --> 00:45:16,498
I mean, that's kind of what got me
into the cloth in the first place.

595
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:19,635
Do you know, demons are mentioned
in 19 of the 27 books of the Bible?

596
00:45:19,769 --> 00:45:22,738
Yeah. The Gadarene Swine,
the Simon Magus, the apocrypha.

597
00:45:22,872 --> 00:45:25,207
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be
geeking out on you. Just ahh!

598
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,843
I love this stuff.

599
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:29,879
I mean, the Bible is like
the ultimate graphic novel.

600
00:45:30,012 --> 00:45:33,982
You know, this whole thing reminds
me of this old story from...

601
00:45:35,217 --> 00:45:38,020
<i>♪ Amen ♪</i>

602
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:42,157
<i>♪ Amen ♪</i>

603
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:44,426
<i>♪ Ah ♪</i>

604
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,394
Yes!

605
00:45:45,527 --> 00:45:47,663
So, there was
this young prince

606
00:45:47,797 --> 00:45:51,433
whose father, a much-beloved king,
was old, like brink-of-death old.

607
00:45:51,567 --> 00:45:53,135
With the King
in such bad shape,

608
00:45:53,268 --> 00:45:55,839
it was up to the prince
to lead the army into battle.

609
00:45:55,971 --> 00:45:59,575
So he tracks down
this old gypsy woman.

610
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:03,278
And he asks her if she can tell
him, will he survive the battle?

611
00:46:03,412 --> 00:46:06,281
The gypsy woman hands him a
scroll with a number on it.

612
00:46:06,415 --> 00:46:10,719
And that number is
the exact moment of his death.

613
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:12,221
But she warns him,

614
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:15,157
"Don't use this
to save yourself,

615
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,226
to change your fate."

616
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,528
Now, the prince agrees,
opens up the scroll.

617
00:46:19,661 --> 00:46:21,997
News ain't good,
not even a little bit.

618
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:23,499
So you know what he does?
Come here.

619
00:46:25,133 --> 00:46:27,971
He sends
his little brother instead.

620
00:46:28,103 --> 00:46:29,906
But his brother doesn't die.

621
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:32,775
In fact, he goes on
to lead the army to victory.

622
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:35,845
Meanwhile, our coward prince
goes back to the old gypsy woman,

623
00:46:35,979 --> 00:46:39,816
and he swears to her,
"The angel of death is coming for me."

624
00:46:39,949 --> 00:46:43,987
But she assures him
Death is not coming for him.

625
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:48,123
What's coming for him now,
there's nothing natural about it.

626
00:46:48,925 --> 00:46:51,026
It's the demon, Ozhin.

627
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:55,230
The moment the prince changed his
fate, Ozhin came for him.

628
00:46:55,364 --> 00:46:57,566
But not to kill him,
to torment him

629
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:01,771
right up until the exact moment
the gypsy predicted he would die.

630
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:03,672
Oh. Thanks, Father.

631
00:47:03,806 --> 00:47:05,507
I didn't think
I could feel any worse.

632
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:07,744
Look, I think...
I mean, I'm not sure,

633
00:47:07,877 --> 00:47:12,147
but this app seems like a modern
version of what the old gypsy lady did.

634
00:47:12,281 --> 00:47:15,717
If I could just see the code,
I think I would know for sure.

635
00:47:15,852 --> 00:47:17,519
You mean like hack the app?

636
00:47:17,854 --> 00:47:20,589
Do you know how to do that,
or do you guys know someone who could?

637
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:22,424
I think I might.

638
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:26,261
Where the heck's my Grubhub?

639
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,807
- Hey, wait! Wait!
- We are closed.

640
00:47:37,941 --> 00:47:40,877
We met earlier, and you said that
you could jailbreak my phone.

641
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:43,679
Does that mean you know
how to hack into an app?

642
00:47:44,146 --> 00:47:45,581
- Yeah.
- Great.

643
00:47:45,714 --> 00:47:47,784
Look, we need your help.
It's kind of an emergency.

644
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:49,084
Sorry.

645
00:47:49,217 --> 00:47:50,853
I'm already running late
to my Tinder date,

646
00:47:50,987 --> 00:47:54,356
and I haven't matched with
anybody in a while. So, no.

647
00:47:54,489 --> 00:47:58,360
Wait, wait, wait. You really
wanna impress this girl?

648
00:47:58,493 --> 00:48:01,196
This credit card
has a $2,000 limit.

649
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:04,700
Yeah. And this one
has about 300 left.

650
00:48:05,334 --> 00:48:07,669
If you help us,
these are yours.

651
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:09,104
Please.

652
00:48:10,405 --> 00:48:11,540
This feels illegal.

653
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:15,677
I like it.

654
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:18,815
Sorry. It's just gonna be,
I don't know, 15 minutes, okay?

655
00:48:18,948 --> 00:48:22,284
I love your profile pic and I cannot
wait to see the real thing in person.

656
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:23,953
Okay. Bye-bye.

657
00:48:24,353 --> 00:48:26,288
All right.
You got 15 minutes. Phone?

658
00:48:26,622 --> 00:48:28,523
It's this app, right here.

659
00:48:28,657 --> 00:48:32,327
Seriously? The Countdown app,
where it tells you when you're gonna die?

660
00:48:32,461 --> 00:48:34,563
- That's so dumb.
- Did you download it?

661
00:48:34,696 --> 00:48:37,399
Of course. Your hysteria
piqued my interest.

662
00:48:37,532 --> 00:48:39,301
It's a great idea.
It's just horrible execution.

663
00:48:39,434 --> 00:48:41,838
I mean, just a random number
with a countdown?

664
00:48:41,971 --> 00:48:43,940
It's not very scary. Though,
it seems like it worked on you two clowns.

665
00:48:44,073 --> 00:48:46,976
Please, please. Just continue.

666
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:48,945
Okay. Thanks.

667
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,648
That's weird. Sixty gigs?

668
00:48:52,782 --> 00:48:54,650
- What does that mean?
- That means it's big.

669
00:48:54,784 --> 00:48:56,886
Like "a season of <i>Game of
Thrones</i> on your phone" big.

670
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,321
Which doesn't make any sense
because it's just a clock.

671
00:48:59,454 --> 00:49:01,356
- Can you still delete it?
- Of course.

672
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:03,258
This is Doc's.
I'm the doc of technology.

673
00:49:03,392 --> 00:49:04,726
I can do anything.

674
00:49:05,928 --> 00:49:07,797
Ha! Check it out.

675
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,032
Now we're in.

676
00:49:09,832 --> 00:49:13,235
What is that?
<i>"Hoc maledictum te..."</i>

677
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:14,904
- That's Latin.
- Are you sure?

678
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:17,472
I went to Catholic high school
for four years. I'm sure.

679
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:19,108
- What's it say?
- No idea.

680
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:20,810
Physically, I was there,
but mentally...

681
00:49:28,283 --> 00:49:30,019
Oh, my God.

682
00:49:30,153 --> 00:49:32,755
Last name, first name.
And look, these are their countdowns.

683
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:33,956
There are so many.

684
00:49:36,324 --> 00:49:37,359
Hey, that's me.

685
00:49:37,492 --> 00:49:39,796
Thirty-two years, 11 days.

686
00:49:39,929 --> 00:49:42,765
Hold on. How long do you guys think
the Marvel Universe will last?

687
00:49:42,899 --> 00:49:44,366
Forty years, 50?

688
00:49:44,499 --> 00:49:46,401
Let's just say 60, to be sure.

689
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:51,373
There it is.

690
00:49:51,874 --> 00:49:54,209
Holy shit. It's working.
Look at his phone.

691
00:49:54,342 --> 00:49:55,644
It worked.

692
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:57,345
Okay.

693
00:49:57,479 --> 00:49:59,247
What's your name, pumpkin?

694
00:49:59,982 --> 00:50:01,650
Quinn Harris.

695
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:05,253
Stop.

696
00:50:05,387 --> 00:50:06,856
That's my sister.

697
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:09,025
Shit.
Of course she downloaded it.

698
00:50:09,158 --> 00:50:12,461
- Her clock is the same as mine.
- Actually, no.

699
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:14,596
Hers is three minutes shorter.
See?

700
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,265
Wait a minute. Was she supposed
to be with you tomorrow?

701
00:50:17,399 --> 00:50:18,868
Yes. Shit!

702
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:20,002
Change hers first.

703
00:50:20,136 --> 00:50:21,236
Got another credit card?

704
00:50:23,405 --> 00:50:26,708
Okay. No, no, no. I'll do it.
I'm a good guy. I'll do it.

705
00:50:42,657 --> 00:50:45,494
You know the rules.
No phones at the table.

706
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:48,131
- But I was...
- You can have it back in the morning.

707
00:50:48,263 --> 00:50:49,397
I was just looking.

708
00:50:53,035 --> 00:50:55,004
Thank you.

709
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:56,404
You're a genius!

710
00:50:56,538 --> 00:50:57,706
Yeah, no shit.

711
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:02,912
Are you still good?

712
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:04,947
Yep.

713
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,216
I got 71 years left.

714
00:51:07,349 --> 00:51:09,819
You know, I kind of feel bad
that I'm gonna outlive you.

715
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:12,021
Don't. 95 is way too old.

716
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:14,422
I'm happy with my 86.

717
00:51:16,424 --> 00:51:17,592
So, should I...

718
00:51:19,061 --> 00:51:21,563
drop you at your car?

719
00:51:21,696 --> 00:51:23,732
Yeah, yeah, sure.

720
00:51:23,866 --> 00:51:27,302
Except for the fact that
my car is right over there.

721
00:51:29,704 --> 00:51:34,309
I suppose I'll call you.

722
00:51:36,444 --> 00:51:38,781
Nice, real nice.

723
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:52,527
Do you wanna be alone tonight?

724
00:51:53,963 --> 00:51:54,897
Not at all.

725
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,977
- Do you mind if I keep these lights on?
- Not at all.

726
00:52:14,016 --> 00:52:16,285
I've been thinking a lot
about what Father John said

727
00:52:16,418 --> 00:52:20,122
about what compelled us to
wanna know when we're gonna die.

728
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:21,991
Me too.

729
00:52:22,825 --> 00:52:23,793
And?

730
00:52:31,466 --> 00:52:33,602
When I was 10,

731
00:52:34,871 --> 00:52:37,639
my little brother,
Jeff, got really sick.

732
00:52:37,773 --> 00:52:40,042
And we practically lived
at the hospital.

733
00:52:40,176 --> 00:52:43,378
My mom and dad could only focus
on Jeff for those two years,

734
00:52:43,511 --> 00:52:45,147
and I get it.

735
00:52:45,281 --> 00:52:47,449
But at the same time,

736
00:52:48,217 --> 00:52:51,419
I was jealous of all the
attention that he was getting.

737
00:52:51,553 --> 00:52:54,790
He had this toy
that I really wanted.

738
00:52:57,525 --> 00:52:59,661
This stupid robot dinosaur.

739
00:52:59,795 --> 00:53:03,465
So when he was asleep,
I took it.

740
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:06,668
I stole
my dying brother's toy.

741
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:12,607
Jeff, he looked up to me.

742
00:53:14,643 --> 00:53:17,113
And I'm the one
that gets to live to be 95.

743
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,650
Yeah, but you were just a kid.

744
00:53:24,153 --> 00:53:25,487
What about you?

745
00:53:26,856 --> 00:53:28,124
My mom.

746
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,396
She was the glue in our family.

747
00:53:33,528 --> 00:53:35,031
But she was tough.

748
00:53:35,164 --> 00:53:36,531
And...

749
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:40,669
on one of the many nights
I was grounded,

750
00:53:40,803 --> 00:53:43,505
my best friend
was having this huge party.

751
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:46,641
And I was so sick
of my mom's shit,

752
00:53:48,543 --> 00:53:50,112
so I went.

753
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:54,884
My mom,

754
00:53:58,254 --> 00:54:00,455
she went out looking for me,

755
00:54:02,358 --> 00:54:04,760
and one drunk driver later,

756
00:54:06,594 --> 00:54:08,264
she was dead.

757
00:54:08,397 --> 00:54:10,099
Quinn, that's not your fault.

758
00:54:13,235 --> 00:54:16,105
Yeah. Thanks.

759
00:54:18,374 --> 00:54:22,078
You know, you don't have to
sleep on the floor.

760
00:54:22,211 --> 00:54:23,112
All right.

761
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:26,082
But just so we're clear,

762
00:54:27,917 --> 00:54:31,619
I don't usually jump into bed with
girls that I just met off of an app.

763
00:54:31,754 --> 00:54:34,890
Well, technically,
we met because of an app.

764
00:54:36,225 --> 00:54:37,226
Good point.

765
00:55:11,093 --> 00:55:12,028
Matt.

766
00:55:13,829 --> 00:55:15,064
Matt, wake up.

767
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Matt!
Yo, are you calling my name?

768
00:55:24,974 --> 00:55:26,275
Oh!

769
00:55:28,643 --> 00:55:30,712
Quinn. Quinn. Quinn. Relax. Relax.

770
00:55:30,846 --> 00:55:32,815
Quinn. Hey. Hey. Hey.

771
00:55:32,948 --> 00:55:34,549
It was just a nightmare.

772
00:55:37,953 --> 00:55:40,990
No, no, no.
It went back to what it was!

773
00:55:41,123 --> 00:55:42,557
Oh, shit.

774
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,093
So did mine.

775
00:55:45,995 --> 00:55:46,929
Oh, no.

776
00:55:48,297 --> 00:55:49,265
Jordan.

777
00:57:20,655 --> 00:57:21,790
Mrs. Talbot?

778
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:38,400
<i>Jordan.</i>

779
00:58:40,169 --> 00:58:41,203
Mom?

780
00:58:41,637 --> 00:58:42,938
<i>Where is she?</i>

781
00:58:46,942 --> 00:58:48,410
<i>Where's your sister?</i>

782
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

783
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

784
00:59:21,777 --> 00:59:22,978
Where is she?

785
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:29,351
It's okay! It's me!

786
00:59:29,952 --> 00:59:30,919
There's something in the house.

787
00:59:31,053 --> 00:59:32,087
I know. Let's get out of here.

788
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:37,059
Hello?

789
00:59:37,426 --> 00:59:38,394
Open up!

790
00:59:38,527 --> 00:59:39,528
Father John!

791
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:42,364
You guys okay?

792
00:59:43,232 --> 00:59:44,300
Did you get the code?

793
00:59:45,301 --> 00:59:46,235
New girl.

794
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:48,170
I'm gonna shirt on.

795
00:59:49,605 --> 00:59:50,539
Come on.

796
00:59:57,112 --> 01:00:02,017
"This curse will come upon you,
will pursue you, and overwhelm you

797
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:03,986
until you are
utterly destroyed."

798
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:06,989
This is good.
This is really good.

799
01:00:07,122 --> 01:00:08,324
How is that good?

800
01:00:08,457 --> 01:00:09,692
Because now we know
what we're dealing with.

801
01:00:09,825 --> 01:00:11,093
This is a curse.

802
01:00:11,226 --> 01:00:13,729
Curses come from
the devil and his servants.

803
01:00:13,862 --> 01:00:16,332
Good news: curses can be broken.

804
01:00:16,465 --> 01:00:18,334
Can I get
a hallelujah high five?

805
01:00:18,467 --> 01:00:19,535
Fine.

806
01:00:19,668 --> 01:00:23,405
Look, gang.
Satan is the father of lies.

807
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:25,908
If you can prove him a liar,
you can break the curse.

808
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:27,609
What does that mean,
"prove him a liar"?

809
01:00:27,744 --> 01:00:30,679
If you can foil the clock,
prove it wrong,

810
01:00:30,814 --> 01:00:33,215
it should lift the curse
from anyone suffering from it.

811
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:35,918
So someone has to die
before they're supposed to?

812
01:00:36,051 --> 01:00:38,220
That would get the job done.

813
01:00:38,354 --> 01:00:40,289
But I don't think anybody here
wants to die, right?

814
01:00:40,422 --> 01:00:42,458
So, I'm thinking the opposite.

815
01:00:42,591 --> 01:00:45,661
We need to keep one of you alive
longer than you're supposed to be.

816
01:00:46,295 --> 01:00:47,629
How are we
supposed to do that?

817
01:00:47,764 --> 01:00:49,298
This thing shows up

818
01:00:49,431 --> 01:00:51,133
and we're just supposed to be
like, "Hang on, I need a sec"?

819
01:00:51,266 --> 01:00:53,168
That's exactly what
we're gonna do.

820
01:00:53,302 --> 01:00:56,405
See, there's protection rituals,
prayers that should buy you some time.

821
01:00:56,773 --> 01:01:00,275
All we need to do is beat
the clock by one second.

822
01:01:00,409 --> 01:01:03,445
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

823
01:01:04,213 --> 01:01:07,015
No.
But I've read about it, a lot!

824
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:09,184
Here!

825
01:01:09,318 --> 01:01:10,719
Got it. Got it. Got it.

826
01:01:10,854 --> 01:01:12,020
Look.

827
01:01:12,688 --> 01:01:14,791
We need to make this
out of salt, right?

828
01:01:14,923 --> 01:01:17,159
Now, once I bless it,
you should be safe inside.

829
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:20,095
See, no impure spirits are
allowed to cross this circle.

830
01:01:20,229 --> 01:01:23,298
It should...
buy you the time you need.

831
01:01:23,432 --> 01:01:25,835
Great. Well, I just have
one question.

832
01:01:25,968 --> 01:01:27,903
Where are we gonna get
that much salt?

833
01:01:28,036 --> 01:01:29,438
I get mine at Costco.

834
01:01:29,571 --> 01:01:32,040
Follow me! Come on!
Clock's ticking, everybody!

835
01:01:32,674 --> 01:01:35,077
Right here. Let me
just turn the lights on.

836
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,445
Good. Right. Come on.

837
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,449
Now, this is rock salt.

838
01:01:40,582 --> 01:01:42,151
I use it to kill weeds.

839
01:01:42,618 --> 01:01:44,119
Will that work?

840
01:01:44,253 --> 01:01:46,388
Salt is salt. Once I bless it,
we're good... I think.

841
01:01:46,522 --> 01:01:48,457
- What?
- No, we're fine. We're gonna be fine.

842
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:50,392
What if it just blows
the salt away?

843
01:01:50,526 --> 01:01:52,027
That could absolutely happen.
I didn't think of that.

844
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:53,328
Goddammit! Sorry.

845
01:01:53,462 --> 01:01:55,097
And I will pray it doesn't.

846
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,165
I have an idea.

847
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,000
Wait. Here.

848
01:01:58,133 --> 01:02:00,436
- Hold this.
- Little small, don't you think?

849
01:02:00,569 --> 01:02:02,271
It's not the size of the cross,
it's the power of the Spirit.

850
01:02:02,404 --> 01:02:04,239
What if we mix it with this?

851
01:02:04,373 --> 01:02:06,074
That is a genius idea. Yes.

852
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:07,443
Let's clear out a space
right here.

853
01:02:07,576 --> 01:02:09,178
Great. Come on.
Clock's ticking, guys!

854
01:02:09,311 --> 01:02:11,447
I'm gonna make a big circle.
Ten, 15 feet. Come on.

855
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:12,948
You good? Great. Okay.

856
01:02:13,081 --> 01:02:14,349
All right, gang. Here we go.

857
01:02:15,717 --> 01:02:16,786
Thicker, thicker.

858
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,822
Lord,

859
01:02:18,954 --> 01:02:20,622
bless this salt.

860
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:25,895
Let Your light hold back the demons
that try to enter our world, Lord.

861
01:02:26,028 --> 01:02:27,629
That's it.
Make that symbol perfect.

862
01:02:27,764 --> 01:02:29,998
Make that as thick as you can.
As thick as you can.

863
01:02:30,132 --> 01:02:31,333
That line right there.

864
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,938
Pretty great! I mean,
it's more of an oval than a circle,

865
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:37,072
but we're under
a lot of pressure.

866
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,409
Okay, how much time
till Matt dies?

867
01:02:42,611 --> 01:02:45,849
Okay, that symbol's good.
That symbol's good. Okay, that's right.

868
01:02:45,981 --> 01:02:48,852
Correct. I got this.

869
01:02:52,054 --> 01:02:53,188
Hey.

870
01:02:55,257 --> 01:02:56,992
- What if this doesn't work?
- It's going to.

871
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:58,594
No, but what if it doesn't?

872
01:02:58,727 --> 01:03:00,028
Listen to me.

873
01:03:00,162 --> 01:03:02,531
It's just salt and paint...

874
01:03:07,236 --> 01:03:08,370
That's good.

875
01:03:13,977 --> 01:03:16,144
- I think we should get in the circle.
- Come on!

876
01:03:20,382 --> 01:03:22,952
- Quinn, I'm scared.
- Me too.

877
01:03:23,085 --> 01:03:26,421
Okay. This might actually
be happening right now.

878
01:03:27,824 --> 01:03:29,759
- I'm gonna go with the bigger cross.
- What?

879
01:03:32,227 --> 01:03:33,629
- It's in here!
- Stay close to me.

880
01:03:33,763 --> 01:03:36,799
Strengthen us in
Your power and might, O Lord.

881
01:03:37,967 --> 01:03:40,003
Dress us in Your armor, Lord,

882
01:03:40,135 --> 01:03:43,205
so that we may stand firm against
the machinations of the devil.

883
01:03:45,173 --> 01:03:47,075
Wait, wait.
It's moving above us.

884
01:03:50,646 --> 01:03:53,016
- Do you see anything?
- No. You?

885
01:03:53,148 --> 01:03:54,416
No.

886
01:03:57,185 --> 01:03:58,654
Okay. Shh, shh, shh.

887
01:04:06,328 --> 01:04:08,163
Wait, wait! Stay behind me!

888
01:04:10,399 --> 01:04:12,936
It's working! He can't get in!

889
01:04:21,978 --> 01:04:23,046
Go back to hell.

890
01:04:23,178 --> 01:04:24,814
- Where did he go?
- Where did he go?

891
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:26,114
Where did he go?

892
01:04:29,018 --> 01:04:31,086
- Turn it off!
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

893
01:04:31,219 --> 01:04:32,855
- Matt, turn it off!
- I'm trying!

894
01:04:33,555 --> 01:04:34,489
There!

895
01:04:40,029 --> 01:04:41,396
Shut it off!

896
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,674
Shut it off!

897
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:55,243
Where is it, Matt?

898
01:05:05,955 --> 01:05:07,056
Jeffy?

899
01:05:07,556 --> 01:05:09,124
Why'd you take my dinosaur?

900
01:05:09,424 --> 01:05:11,326
Jeffy, I was gonna
give it back. I swear.

901
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:13,595
No, you weren't.

902
01:05:18,266 --> 01:05:19,468
You're right.

903
01:05:19,969 --> 01:05:20,870
Jeffy, I'm sorry.

904
01:05:24,439 --> 01:05:25,875
Matt! What do you see?

905
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:27,209
Jeffy, don't go.

906
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:31,914
Huh?

907
01:05:35,717 --> 01:05:36,618
Matt!

908
01:05:38,855 --> 01:05:39,822
Quinn!

909
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:43,725
No, Jordan,
don't break the circle!

910
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Matt!
We did it.
He let me go...

911
01:06:00,743 --> 01:06:02,779
Help! Help!

912
01:06:24,466 --> 01:06:26,368
I'll see you soon.

913
01:06:31,741 --> 01:06:32,708
Quinn?

914
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:35,978
He's gone.

915
01:06:37,947 --> 01:06:39,247
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

916
01:06:41,683 --> 01:06:43,485
No, it makes sense.
It was his time.

917
01:06:44,821 --> 01:06:46,989
Pretty soon
it'll be our time, too.

918
01:06:47,389 --> 01:06:48,690
Please don't say that.

919
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,463
I don't want to, but you
just saw what happened.

920
01:06:55,697 --> 01:06:57,332
Oh, my God.

921
01:06:57,466 --> 01:06:58,366
Are you bleeding?

922
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,235
You're bleeding!

923
01:07:00,368 --> 01:07:02,171
We need some help in here!

924
01:07:02,972 --> 01:07:05,108
- We need a wheelchair!
- Quinn, what happened?

925
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,509
There was an accident. She has
a puncture to the abdomen.

926
01:07:07,642 --> 01:07:09,311
We got her. We'll get her right in.
Go check in with Rosie.

927
01:07:09,444 --> 01:07:10,479
Okay.

928
01:07:10,612 --> 01:07:12,414
No. Please, Quinn,
don't leave me.

929
01:07:12,547 --> 01:07:15,017
I'm not going anywhere.
I will be right there.

930
01:07:15,151 --> 01:07:18,253
- Please don't leave me. Please.
- I'll be right there.

931
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:25,762
Sorry, honey, are you okay?

932
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:31,700
Matt's train.

933
01:07:31,834 --> 01:07:34,703
That's not too bad. You're
pretty tough though, right?

934
01:07:36,571 --> 01:07:38,174
Quinn. Hey.

935
01:07:38,306 --> 01:07:39,809
Can I talk to you?

936
01:07:39,942 --> 01:07:42,912
- I really...
- I heard what happened with Dr. Sullivan.

937
01:07:43,045 --> 01:07:44,013
I know what happened.

938
01:07:45,047 --> 01:07:46,082
I mean...

939
01:07:46,414 --> 01:07:48,617
I personally know...

940
01:07:49,218 --> 01:07:50,753
I just want you to know

941
01:07:50,887 --> 01:07:53,588
that if you go after him,
I'm with you.

942
01:07:57,059 --> 01:07:58,928
I think you're gonna be
A-okay. Look at me.

943
01:08:04,867 --> 01:08:06,068
Thank you.

944
01:08:06,601 --> 01:08:08,805
Truly, thank you, Rachel.

945
01:08:09,906 --> 01:08:10,840
All right.

946
01:08:11,606 --> 01:08:12,809
Just like your big sister.

947
01:08:15,178 --> 01:08:16,311
I'll let you two at it.

948
01:08:17,546 --> 01:08:18,948
You'll be in good hands,
kiddo.

949
01:08:20,283 --> 01:08:21,383
Thank you.

950
01:08:22,417 --> 01:08:23,518
Of course.

951
01:08:33,095 --> 01:08:33,963
Are you okay?

952
01:08:36,098 --> 01:08:37,200
Does it hurt?

953
01:08:37,934 --> 01:08:40,335
Quinn, I know you think
it was your fault,

954
01:08:40,468 --> 01:08:41,603
Mom dying.

955
01:08:43,471 --> 01:08:44,841
It was my fault.

956
01:08:44,974 --> 01:08:45,975
What?

957
01:08:46,108 --> 01:08:48,778
Mom asked me where you were,
and I knew.

958
01:08:49,812 --> 01:08:51,147
And if I had just told her,

959
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,282
she wouldn't have been driving
way over by the mall.

960
01:08:53,415 --> 01:08:54,951
Jordan,

961
01:08:55,952 --> 01:08:59,554
it is not your fault some
drunk asshole ran a red light.

962
01:09:00,555 --> 01:09:02,524
Then it's not your fault,
either.

963
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,971
I think Mom would be happy we're
spending our last few minutes together.

964
01:09:16,504 --> 01:09:18,406
These are not
our last few minutes.

965
01:09:19,507 --> 01:09:20,609
Wait, Quinn.

966
01:09:21,509 --> 01:09:22,611
Trust me.

967
01:09:23,746 --> 01:09:26,581
Quinn!
What are you gonna do? Quinn!

968
01:09:29,785 --> 01:09:32,154
No,
I just finished a procedure.

969
01:09:32,288 --> 01:09:33,856
Saving lives
one day at a time.

970
01:09:36,859 --> 01:09:38,693
Okay, honey,
I'll let you get back to work.

971
01:09:39,795 --> 01:09:41,797
I love you, too. Bye.

972
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:45,600
You shouldn't be in here.

973
01:09:45,935 --> 01:09:48,037
I wanted to thank you
for helping my sister.

974
01:09:49,138 --> 01:09:50,072
And...

975
01:09:50,806 --> 01:09:52,375
say that I'm sorry.

976
01:09:52,507 --> 01:09:53,608
For what?

977
01:09:55,077 --> 01:09:56,645
For everything.

978
01:09:56,779 --> 01:10:00,983
I can't stop thinking about how
things could've gone that day.

979
01:10:01,117 --> 01:10:03,352
I understand
why you did what you did.

980
01:10:03,485 --> 01:10:05,154
I put you in that position.

981
01:10:08,357 --> 01:10:12,694
If only I had followed through with
how I really felt in that moment.

982
01:10:14,629 --> 01:10:16,098
I was just scared.

983
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:22,504
Bullshit.

984
01:10:25,174 --> 01:10:27,076
You think I'm stupid? Hmm?

985
01:10:28,177 --> 01:10:29,111
What do you really want?

986
01:10:30,346 --> 01:10:31,414
I want my job back.

987
01:10:32,114 --> 01:10:34,183
You said that
we both like helping people.

988
01:10:34,582 --> 01:10:37,954
So maybe you can help me

989
01:10:38,421 --> 01:10:39,789
and I...

990
01:10:41,556 --> 01:10:42,724
...could help you.

991
01:10:45,761 --> 01:10:47,129
Okay, what are you doing?

992
01:10:48,331 --> 01:10:49,231
You recording this?

993
01:10:52,734 --> 01:10:54,636
Search me if you want.

994
01:10:55,871 --> 01:10:57,472
I'll be in the closed wing.

995
01:10:57,605 --> 01:10:59,208
You should come.

996
01:10:59,742 --> 01:11:01,476
Or don't. It's up to you.

997
01:11:19,527 --> 01:11:20,595
Quinn?

998
01:11:23,531 --> 01:11:24,566
Quinn?

999
01:11:24,699 --> 01:11:25,901
Come find me.

1000
01:11:40,682 --> 01:11:44,120
You know, I'm not gonna lie,

1001
01:11:44,619 --> 01:11:46,856
I didn't see this one coming.

1002
01:11:51,526 --> 01:11:53,229
You dropped something.

1003
01:11:53,863 --> 01:11:57,033
Close your eyes
and say, "Marco."

1004
01:11:58,801 --> 01:12:01,103
I like this.

1005
01:12:02,204 --> 01:12:03,339
Marco.

1006
01:12:03,705 --> 01:12:04,807
Polo.

1007
01:12:06,574 --> 01:12:08,244
Marco.

1008
01:12:08,576 --> 01:12:10,046
Polo.

1009
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:16,052
Marco.

1010
01:12:18,354 --> 01:12:19,288
Polo.

1011
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:23,893
I can hear you breathing.

1012
01:12:27,329 --> 01:12:29,065
Bitch!

1013
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:31,167
- What the hell is that?
- Morphine,

1014
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,536
enough to kill you three times,
you piece of shit!

1015
01:12:33,668 --> 01:12:34,904
Quinn, don't!

1016
01:12:36,005 --> 01:12:37,840
It's either him or you.

1017
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:43,746
Did you see that? It saved him.

1018
01:12:43,879 --> 01:12:45,081
This is gonna work.

1019
01:12:45,214 --> 01:12:46,148
What's gonna work?

1020
01:12:46,849 --> 01:12:48,317
He has the app.

1021
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:50,486
If he dies before he's supposed
to, it'll break the curse!

1022
01:12:50,618 --> 01:12:51,887
Quinn!

1023
01:13:05,733 --> 01:13:08,571
Quinn, where are you?

1024
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1025
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:04,226
Crazy bitch!
What the hell was that thing?

1026
01:14:10,366 --> 01:14:15,703
Doesn't matter. I'll tell the
cops how you lured me back here.

1027
01:14:16,338 --> 01:14:18,440
How I had to kill you
out of self-defense.

1028
01:14:25,247 --> 01:14:27,349
Your time's up, you rapey fuck!

1029
01:14:40,695 --> 01:14:42,131
Shit.

1030
01:14:50,639 --> 01:14:53,242
Jordan. Jordan!

1031
01:15:00,816 --> 01:15:01,984
Jordan.

1032
01:15:40,889 --> 01:15:44,426
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.

1033
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

1034
01:17:01,837 --> 01:17:03,005
Hey!

1035
01:17:03,138 --> 01:17:04,440
Get away from her.

1036
01:17:06,776 --> 01:17:07,777
What are you doing?

1037
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:09,545
I love you, Jordan.

1038
01:17:10,579 --> 01:17:11,748
I'll always be with you.

1039
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,449
Quinn, don't!

1040
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:15,918
Quinny Bear.

1041
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,156
Mom?

1042
01:17:22,725 --> 01:17:23,892
Where were you that night?

1043
01:17:29,766 --> 01:17:31,467
I'm so sorry.

1044
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,669
I was looking for you.

1045
01:17:33,803 --> 01:17:35,204
I know.

1046
01:17:39,141 --> 01:17:40,209
I miss you.

1047
01:17:41,143 --> 01:17:43,145
I miss you too, baby.

1048
01:17:43,979 --> 01:17:45,247
Come here.

1049
01:18:05,334 --> 01:18:06,135
No.

1050
01:18:06,268 --> 01:18:08,003
You're not in control anymore.

1051
01:18:08,604 --> 01:18:09,738
I am.

1052
01:18:10,105 --> 01:18:11,473
Quinn, no!

1053
01:18:16,011 --> 01:18:17,112
Quinn!

1054
01:18:20,983 --> 01:18:22,518
No!

1055
01:19:14,203 --> 01:19:15,737
Somebody help me!

1056
01:19:17,506 --> 01:19:18,440
Quinn!

1057
01:19:21,443 --> 01:19:22,277
Please.

1058
01:19:22,411 --> 01:19:24,279
Please don't leave me.

1059
01:19:25,247 --> 01:19:26,916
Please.

1060
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:29,184
Please don't leave me.

1061
01:19:32,387 --> 01:19:33,322
Please.

1062
01:20:10,125 --> 01:20:11,326
Come on, come on, come on.

1063
01:20:11,727 --> 01:20:13,161
Please work.

1064
01:20:13,295 --> 01:20:14,530
Come on, come on, come on.

1065
01:20:15,798 --> 01:20:17,399
Please work, please.

1066
01:20:23,238 --> 01:20:25,107
Quinn, come on.

1067
01:20:36,786 --> 01:20:37,954
See?

1068
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,689
I told you
I'd always be with you.

1069
01:20:40,823 --> 01:20:42,190
I love you.

1070
01:20:58,273 --> 01:20:59,708
Happy birthday, Mom.

1071
01:21:06,849 --> 01:21:07,750
They're beautiful.

1072
01:21:25,233 --> 01:21:26,401
Oh, my gosh.

1073
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:30,205
Three more women came
forward about Dr. Sullivan.

1074
01:21:30,339 --> 01:21:32,107
Looks like he's going away
for a long time.

1075
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,776
Good. Serves him right.

1076
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:36,111
I'm just glad
no one else is gonna get hurt.

1077
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:39,348
Coming to the house, Quinny?

1078
01:21:39,481 --> 01:21:41,050
I have to stop
at the hospital first.

1079
01:21:41,183 --> 01:21:42,819
- You wanna come with me?
- Yeah.

1080
01:21:42,952 --> 01:21:45,320
- All right. I'll see you guys at home.
- Cool.

1081
01:21:49,025 --> 01:21:49,892
You coming?

1082
01:21:54,296 --> 01:21:55,330
What's wrong?

1083
01:22:56,425 --> 01:22:58,593
- A little more?
- No, thank you. No.

1084
01:22:59,028 --> 01:23:01,064
Oh. We killed it.

1085
01:23:01,630 --> 01:23:05,300
I gotta tell you something.
Now that we know each other a little bit,

1086
01:23:05,434 --> 01:23:07,636
you are a lot chestier
than your profile pic.

1087
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:09,705
Oh. Thanks.

1088
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:12,175
And you don't look
anything like yours.

1089
01:23:12,307 --> 01:23:13,709
- Appreciate that. Thank you.
- At all.

1090
01:23:13,843 --> 01:23:17,379
Okay. I revised your check
for the third time.

1091
01:23:17,512 --> 01:23:19,314
Also, we closed
a half hour ago. So...

1092
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:26,655
We love it here.

1093
01:23:27,255 --> 01:23:28,423
I'm sure you do.

1094
01:23:28,557 --> 01:23:30,193
- What a catch.
- Yeah.

1095
01:23:30,325 --> 01:23:31,928
I don't know
what your data plan is,

1096
01:23:32,061 --> 01:23:36,833
but I can get you a 15,
maybe 20% discount.

1097
01:23:36,966 --> 01:23:38,134
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

1098
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:39,601
I'm gonna
use the ladies' room.

1099
01:23:39,735 --> 01:23:42,537
Okay. I will be here,
my darling.

1100
01:23:42,671 --> 01:23:43,840
Yeah.

1101
01:23:53,149 --> 01:23:54,349
What the hell?

1102
01:23:55,417 --> 01:23:56,919
Hello?

1103
01:23:57,419 --> 01:24:00,022
Dude, we're still here.
Come on, man.

1104
01:24:00,156 --> 01:24:01,858
Dude.

1105
01:24:01,991 --> 01:24:03,126
What the hell?

1106
01:24:06,691 --> 01:24:11,691
