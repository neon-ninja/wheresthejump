00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,168
Shh! Shh!

3
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,132
We caught the bitch.

4
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,358
Please don't hurt me.

5
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,861
Don't be afraid, girl.

6
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:35,615
Who are you?

7
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,039
Somebody please help me.

8
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:48,961
Only the evil book can undo
what the evil book has done.

9
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,881
Please.
I just want to go home.

10
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:56,886
Please.
I just want to go home.

11
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:07,397
Daddy?

12
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,527
Daddy, why are you
doing this to me?

13
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:14,445
Who are these people?

14
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:16,155
Look, they are good people.

15
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,616
They are here to help.

16
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:20,660
What are you talking about?

17
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,620
Where's Mom?

18
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,540
Mommy is dead, baby.

19
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:26,958
You know that.

20
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,964
You killed her.

21
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,173
What?

22
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,466
You did.

23
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,261
No, why are you
saying these things?

24
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,930
Please, I just want go home.

25
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:42,223
I just want to go home.

26
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:45,393
Do it! It's the only way
to save her soul!

27
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,273
I'm so sorry, baby.

28
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,275
Daddy, what is that?

29
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,199
Daddy.

30
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,952
Daddy, look at me.
It's me.

31
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:06,622
Do it!
Give your daughter peace!

32
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:09,542
I just want you to hold
me and take me home.

33
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,919
Please.

34
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,551
Please stop.

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
I will rip your
soul out, Daddy.
I'll rip your soul out,
you pathetic fuck!

36
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,816
Motherfucker!

37
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,109
I Will kill you

38
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:36,277
like I killed...

39
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:39,197
your whore!

40
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:44,702
Fuck!

41
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,371
Fuck!

42
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,465
I love you, baby.

43
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:27,930
Hey.

44
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,182
How's it going,
Mr. Hot Shit City Boy?

45
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,351
Hey, Olivia.
Come here.

46
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,478
Two arms, please.
Like you missed me.

47
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:35,813
Mmm.

48
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,816
This is my girl Natalie.

49
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,068
Oh, the heartbreaker
from your car shop.

50
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,486
The doctor?

51
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:43,779
Actually, she's...

52
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:45,239
I'm a registered nurse.

53
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,908
Nurse.
Mmm-hmm.

54
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:49,076
Right, sorry.

55
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,162
You were supposed to be
here two hours ago, man.

56
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:53,497
And that's our
irresistibly charming Eric.

57
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,125
Teaching high school finally turned
you into a bitter old coot, huh?

58
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,794
No, you did.

59
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,213
You kept us waiting here
all morning.

60
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,508
Good to see you too, man.
Come here.

61
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,969
You look good.

62
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:10,681
She's waiting for you
in the back.

63
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:12,808
Great.

64
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,032
Hey, Mia.

65
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,202
I'll be damned.

66
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,705
You actually came.

67
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,832
Come on, I'm your big brother.

68
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,459
Of course I came.

69
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,836
I know I look like road kill.

70
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,839
Oh, you look beautiful,
as always.

71
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,969
And you're a charming
liar, as always.

72
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:51,305
Grandpa?

73
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,724
Hey.

74
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,852
Hey, there buddy.

75
00:07:57,937 --> 00:08:00,439
We always loved this
place, didn't we?

76
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:03,275
He missed you a lot, you know.

77
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:08,656
Oh, my God.
What?

78
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:11,033
What is that?
What?

79
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,702
Just this, right here.

80
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:17,331
It's not funny!

81
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,668
This is made from
a buckthorn tree.

82
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:23,087
It's supposed to
make your will stronger.

83
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,047
I thought you didn't
believe in that kind of stuff.

84
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,341
I don't. But you do,

85
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:28,592
so, maybe it'll work.

86
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:31,971
Okay.

87
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:35,224
Well, then, let's do this.

88
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,607
Promise me you'll stay
with me until the end.

89
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,026
I'm not going anywhere.

90
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,861
Cross your heart.

91
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,487
Okay.

92
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:51,824
Hope to die.

93
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,203
Okay.

94
00:08:56,495 --> 00:09:00,875
May my friends and family
witness this act...

95
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:06,130
an irrevocable promise
to my commitment that...

96
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,218
Fuck it.

97
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:18,726
I promise not to
touch this shit...

98
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,562
ever again.

99
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:27,443
Okay.

100
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:31,906
Let's play cold turkey.

101
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,914
Hopefully, this still works.

102
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:45,586
Wait.

103
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:00,684
Looks like someone broke in.

104
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,062
Be careful.

105
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:16,242
What is that smell?

106
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:21,664
Some teenagers probably just broke
in here to drink beer and bump uglies.

107
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:23,249
Exactly.

108
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:27,670
Mom would have hated
seeing the cabin like this.

109
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,088
Okay.

110
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:32,133
Let's make this place livable.

111
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,004
Hey.

112
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,465
Are you okay?

113
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,012
Do you remember that
lullaby Mom used to sing us?

114
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,431
It was something like...

115
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,936
"Baby, little baby,
it's time to say goodbye."

116
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:29,899
"Baby, little baby..."

117
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,525
Mia, please,
I don't think you need

118
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:34,153
sad memories in
your head right now.

119
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,155
Mom is not a sad one.

120
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,240
You know what I mean.

121
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,580
You know what? Her final
days at the hospital...

122
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:48,834
Mom sometimes
thought I was you.

123
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:53,756
She even called me David
for a whole day, once.

124
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:57,009
And I played along, because...

125
00:11:57,176 --> 00:12:00,679
Mia, I wanted to be there.
Okay, I did.

126
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:03,098
But by the time Mom got bad...

127
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,768
I had just gotten the job
at the garage in Chicago.

128
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:10,231
I don't know, I had a hard time finding
the right moment to come back.

129
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:15,152
And then it was
too late. So...

130
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:21,700
Maybe you were lucky, not to
see her the way that I did.

131
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:57,987
It looks like
she is doing okay.

132
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,823
David, there is something
you need to know.

133
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:04,994
Okay.

134
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,037
We already tried
this whole thing

135
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,580
back in Flint last summer.

136
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,293
Mia made the same promises.

137
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,338
She took the same
dramatic vow of sobriety

138
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,023
before chucking her
dope down the toilet.

139
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:20,217
She lasted eight hours
and quit.

140
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,721
So, we don't want to

141
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,139
give her that chance this time.

142
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,516
What do you mean?

143
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:30,227
David, when she breaks...

144
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,855
and believe me, she will...

145
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,483
we don't want to let her leave.

146
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,072
What do you mean? You want
force her to stay here?

147
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,490
Mia?

148
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:47,244
This time the only way
is the hard way, man.

149
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:48,571
She won't survive another OD.

150
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,747
What?

151
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,458
Mia OD'd?

152
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,252
She didn't just OD.

153
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,338
Legally, your sister died.

154
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,049
They had to defibrillate her.

155
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,637
Jesus.

156
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,476
We all need to be together on this.
Otherwise it won't work.

157
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,811
Good boy.

158
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:14,813
I came here to make things
better with my sister,

159
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:15,939
not worse.

160
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,612
If she asks me to
take her home at some point

161
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,989
I'm going to have to do it.

162
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,952
I can't stand it!
Fuck!

163
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,455
I can't stand it!

164
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,624
What the fuck is that smell?

165
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,042
I know.

166
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,003
It's okay.
It's okay.

167
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,131
I can't stand that
fucking smell anymore.

168
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,342
Lie down, okay?

169
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,844
We're here for you.
I know, I know.

170
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,015
We're all here.

171
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,809
We're all here.

172
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:55,270
We're not going anywhere.

173
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:04,571
Withdrawal is kicking in hard.

174
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,949
This should help you
get through the night.

175
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:10,327
I don't know what
is wrong with you people...

176
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:13,956
but there is something
dead and it reeks.

177
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,958
But there is no smell.

178
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,668
You're just
extra-sensitive right now.

179
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,171
I just can't stand that
fucking smell anymore.

180
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,259
Wait.

181
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:36,937
Oh, is that blood?

182
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:53,787
Shit. Oh...

183
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:58,667
What's your
medical diagnosis now?

184
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,462
It fucking stinks.

185
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,714
Shit. Careful.

186
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,883
These steps are old and rotten.

187
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,010
Yeah, like this
whole freaking house.

188
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,094
I know.

189
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:17,436
Ugh!

190
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,231
It smells like burnt hair.

191
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:23,859
I think it's back there.

192
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:31,742
Oh!

193
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,544
Ugh!

194
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,342
Oh, my God!

195
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,010
Shit.

196
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:56,934
What is this?

197
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,103
I don't know.
Witchcraft?

198
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,105
Who would do this?

199
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,529
Shit, something burned here.

200
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:12,950
Look.

201
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,206
Shit, man.

202
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,917
What the fuck happened here?

203
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,253
Let's not go crazy
over this. Okay?

204
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:26,588
I'll bury those dead cats
out back later.

205
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:29,216
Yeah. The smell will
be gone in no time.

206
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,134
Yeah, okay.

207
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,972
And what about the voodoo
shit they did down there?

208
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,308
No, no, no. Voodoo is more about
dolls and personal artifacts.

209
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,810
This is something different.

210
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,228
Eric, that's enough.

211
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,608
You shouldn't have touched
anything from that basement.

212
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,695
"Naturom Demonto."

213
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,326
"Kunda."

214
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:51,918
"Astratta."

215
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,842
"Montosse."

216
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
"Canda."

217
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:22,282
Please, God, give me a break.

218
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,874
Mia.

219
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:43,720
What are you doing?

220
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:47,307
I'm sorry, but I have to
get out of here right now.

221
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,392
No, come on. The slumber
party isn't over yet.

222
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,800
Yeah, we still haven't played
"Fuck, Marry, Kill," right?

223
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,021
Mia, please look...

224
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,981
I'm going insane here.

225
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:59,152
Olivia, I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

226
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:00,237
What is it?

227
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,867
I will go through
with this, okay?

228
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,161
I just...
I can't do it here.

229
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:09,704
Mia...

230
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,834
we have decided we're
not going to take you back.

231
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,422
We can't lose you again.

232
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,591
You're going to have to
stick it out this time.

233
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,555
David, drive me home.

234
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,394
Come on, David.

235
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:35,689
Mia, maybe they're right.

236
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:43,280
You were supposed to be here
to support me, not them.

237
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,447
I'm here for you.

238
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:45,949
That's why I came.
Oh, my God.

239
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:47,951
I'm such an idiot.

240
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,412
To think for once in my life...

241
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:52,914
I could count on you.

242
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,211
Mia, we're just
trying to help you.

243
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,422
Well, fuck you very much!

244
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:08,597
Eric, leave her alone.

245
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:10,765
Mia.

246
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:24,779
Mia!

247
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,492
Perfect.

248
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,245
Fuck this. Fuck, fuck.

249
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,747
Fuck!

250
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,624
Fuck!

251
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the fuck am I doing?
What the fuck am I doing?

252
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:25,942
Mia!

253
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Mia!
- Mia!
Mia.

254
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,249
Mia!

255
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,020
Mia.

256
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,157
Mia!

257
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:38,408
Mia!

258
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,076
Mia!

259
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:45,748
Mia!
Shit.

260
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,503
Oh, my God.

261
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,182
Hey, how's she doing?

262
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,435
Um, she's talking about
a woman in the woods.

263
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,395
How the forest attacked her.

264
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:10,523
I don't know. It's just
crazy withdrawal talk.

265
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,901
Don't you think we should
take her to a hospital?

266
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,861
I feel like we're in
over our heads here.

267
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,363
Okay. I am giving her
the exact same treatment

268
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,032
she would get at a hospital.

269
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:25,747
If we leave now, all of this
mess will have been for nothing.

270
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:28,291
Okay. What about
the wounds on her arms?

271
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,711
I pulled some thorns out.

272
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,445
It looks like she might have run
into a thorn bush out there.

273
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,633
She probably did it on purpose.

274
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:38,635
What?

275
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:41,596
David...

276
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:43,837
from now on, she is going to do

277
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,558
whatever it takes
to get out of here.

278
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Mia.

279
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,332
Listen, you have to
get out of those clothes.

280
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:10,959
All right?
Take a shower.

281
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,126
David.

282
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,129
Please.

283
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,465
Please.

284
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:22,470
You have to get me...

285
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,847
out of here.

286
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,330
Nobody said this
was going to be easy.

287
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,145
No.

288
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,817
You don't understand.

289
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:40,029
There was something
in the woods, David.

290
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:51,040
And I think it's in
here with us now.

291
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,544
With me in the room?

292
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,311
Look. You know
it's all in your head.

293
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,147
Just try to get it together.

294
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,735
You'll feel better
tomorrow, okay?

295
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,820
You'll be glad
we were such assholes.

296
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:24,782
Okay.

297
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

298
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:04,906
Eric, what are you doing?

299
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,241
Would you please just
get rid of that thing?

300
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:10,244
You should be downstairs helping
your friend clean up that mess.

301
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:13,039
I don't know who
you're talking about.

302
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,625
Don't act like you
don't care about him.

303
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:17,919
I know you do.

304
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:21,547
I think we can all agree
he hasn't cared about us

305
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:24,092
for the past freaking century.

306
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,136
Well, he's here now.

307
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,598
Yeah.

308
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:33,059
Truly amazing.

309
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,398
Ugh.

310
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:07,009
Grandpa?

311
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,933
Grandpa!

312
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:22,150
Grandpa?

313
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:24,777
Come here, boy.

314
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:26,028
Fuck.

315
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,373
Grandpa.

316
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,294
No, no, no.

317
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:44,547
Hey, boy. Come here.

318
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:53,848
What did you get into?

319
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:56,350
Fuck.

320
00:32:58,144 --> 00:32:59,562
What happened?

321
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

322
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:21,584
Mia?

323
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,044
She's in the shower.

324
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:26,047
What happened? David?

325
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:29,425
Mia?

326
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,345
Mia, open the door.

327
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,433
Hey, Mia, open the door.

328
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:39,519
Open the door!

329
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:40,923
David, what are you doing?

330
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:45,942
David, stop and
tell me what's going on.

331
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:48,861
Mia, open the fucking door!

332
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,077
Mia?

333
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:58,120
Mia, open the fucking door!

334
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,408
David!

335
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:02,708
David!

336
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:05,127
Stop it!

337
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,420
Mia!

338
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,301
Mia?

339
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:14,971
Mia?

340
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,141
Olivia!

341
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:22,895
Holy shit!

342
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,647
Mia!

343
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:37,243
Shit.

344
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,413
This is insane.

345
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:49,005
Fuck. Where is it?

346
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,199
This can't be happening.

347
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:48,064
I gave her a sedative so she should
be out for a couple of hours.

348
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:53,152
But, fuck, her burns are serious.
Like, second, third degree.

349
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,613
This is so wrong.

350
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:57,698
Nobody could have known she
would do something so twisted!

351
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:59,700
No, you should have known!

352
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:01,787
We've been following your
lead since we got here.

353
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,683
We should have left
when Mia wanted to.

354
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:09,168
Baby, please! Let's not
lose our heads, okay?

355
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,296
With any luck, it will stop
raining in a couple of hours...

356
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:13,714
and we'll be able to cross
the creek in the morning,

357
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:15,299
and take her to a hospital.

358
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:17,927
Okay? Everything
is going to be fine.

359
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:20,805
"Everything is
going to be fine"?

360
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,392
Everything is going to be fine.

361
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,855
I don't know if you've noticed
this, but nothing has been fine.

362
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:34,068
And everything has been
getting worse every second.

363
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,033
Mia?

364
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:50,418
Mia?

365
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,462
What are you doing?

366
00:36:58,134 --> 00:37:00,344
Mia, put the gun down.

367
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,513
Put the gun down, please.

368
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:09,812
Mia.

369
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Put the fucking gun down!

370
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:22,158
Die!

371
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,955
One by one we will take you!

372
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:34,086
You are all
going to die tonight.

373
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
The gun.
The gun, quick!
Baby?

374
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,491
Mia!

375
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,214
Let me out!
She's totally psychotic.

376
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,382
My God,
what happened to her eyes?

377
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,215
What's she doing?

378
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:34,814
It sounds like she's hitting
herself against something.

379
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,440
This is impossible.

380
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:39,100
I just gave her enough sedative
to put a horse to sleep.

381
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,778
Give her another shot!

382
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:43,656
That could put her into a coma.

383
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:46,226
For Christ's sakes, she's going
to kill herself down there!

384
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,203
Go get the shot!

385
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,014
I have to get the shrapnel
out of my arm.

386
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,125
What? I have tweezers
in my purse.

387
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:58,587
David. Listen to me.

388
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:02,174
I don't think a tranquilizer
is going to do shit.

389
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,262
Because I don't think we're dealing
with a freaking panic attack here!

390
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:09,348
I'm scared that what's happening
to Mia has something to do...

391
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:11,517
with the fucking witchcraft
in the basement!

392
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Ow!

393
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:36,143
Olivia!

394
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,488
Olivia?

395
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:11,220
Olivia?

396
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,014
Are you okay?

397
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,481
Olivia?

398
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:48,007
Olivia,
what are you doing in there?

399
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:53,137
Olivia.

400
00:41:56,724 --> 00:41:57,725
Olivia.

401
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,647
Are you okay?

402
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:10,446
Oh, my God!

403
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:13,198
Why the fuck did you do that?

404
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:37,014
Kill him.

405
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:17,054
No!

406
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,023
Ah!

407
00:43:28,524 --> 00:43:30,275
She tried to kill me.

408
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:32,653
She tried to kill me.

409
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:50,879
Fuck.

410
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:55,592
You hold that.
You got it?

411
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:08,981
Hold it there, okay?
Hold it.

412
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:10,566
Fuck it.

413
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:18,198
David,
I did something terrible.

414
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,951
I'm sure you
didn't mean to hurt her.

415
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:24,204
That thing I
killed was not Olivia.

416
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:25,622
He's losing too much blood.

417
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:27,457
Baby, he needs water and sugar.
Okay?

418
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:28,584
Go.

419
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:30,335
Go!

420
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:31,670
Okay. Okay.

421
00:44:35,174 --> 00:44:36,592
All right.
David.

422
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:41,430
I read a passage
from that book.

423
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:44,766
It was some sort of prayer.

424
00:44:45,893 --> 00:44:47,811
I released something, David.

425
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:54,234
I released something evil.

426
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

427
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,921
Natalie?

428
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,181
Mia?

429
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:08,976
Natalie.

430
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:16,692
What am I doing down here?

431
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,445
My leg hurts.

432
00:46:22,114 --> 00:46:23,615
I can't move.

433
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:29,663
I'm going to come
down there, okay?

434
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,501
Why did you lock me down here?

435
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:37,254
You were supposed to help me.

436
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:40,048
Hey, we're trying
to help you, okay?

437
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,760
You were out of control,
you know?

438
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:46,888
You got violent and we
didn't know what else to do.

439
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,935
Mia, something really
terrible has happened...

440
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:53,979
and we have to
get out of here now.

441
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:57,357
You don't understand.

442
00:46:57,441 --> 00:46:58,681
He's not going to
let you leave!

443
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:02,821
And he's not going to stop
until he has you.

444
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:05,866
Until he has all of you!

445
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

446
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:20,399
I can smell your filthy soul.

447
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:49,052
Kiss me, you dirty cunt!

448
00:49:07,863 --> 00:49:10,574
Why don't you come down here so I
can suck your cock, pretty boy!

449
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:11,992
Mia.

450
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:13,869
Mia's not here,
you fucking idiot!

451
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:18,039
Your little sister
is being raped in hell!

452
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:36,016
Home. I want to go home.

453
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,034
Eric.

454
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:58,538
I don't know why, but I
thought this would end it.

455
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,628
But this book does not burn.

456
00:50:06,922 --> 00:50:09,174
It does not fucking burn.

457
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:15,222
Tell me what's going on here.

458
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:30,904
This book uses some...

459
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:34,241
ancient alphabet.

460
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:37,035
There's some translations,
but...

461
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:38,995
Just scattered notes.

462
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:41,957
They all refer to some...

463
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:44,793
evil entity.

464
00:50:45,794 --> 00:50:47,963
A taker of souls.

465
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:51,258
A demon.

466
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:53,176
It says...

467
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:57,889
"Once he feasts
on five souls..."

468
00:50:58,056 --> 00:51:02,143
"the sky will bleed again
and the abomination..."

469
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,437
"will rise from Hell."

470
00:51:47,981 --> 00:51:49,316
This is insane.

471
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:53,903
This thing is attached to
Mia's soul like a leech...

472
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:55,905
it's becoming her.

473
00:51:56,489 --> 00:52:01,369
If we want to stop this,
if we want to help Mia...

474
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:10,712
I think we're going
to have to kill her.

475
00:52:12,172 --> 00:52:13,465
What did you say?

476
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:14,633
Everything says...

477
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:17,260
Eric! We're not going to
fucking kill anybody!

478
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:19,638
Are you listening to yourself?

479
00:52:21,348 --> 00:52:23,516
What about those dead cats
down in the basement?

480
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:25,518
I mean, maybe they
had some disease.

481
00:52:25,602 --> 00:52:27,771
Some virus that
spread to Mia...

482
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:29,814
and then she
passed it to Olivia

483
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:31,191
when she puked
all over her face!

484
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,653
But what kind of a virus
makes a person

485
00:52:34,736 --> 00:52:37,155
cut off their face
with a piece of glass?

486
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:42,369
Oh, God.

487
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,928
I don't know what we're
dealing with here, okay?

488
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:04,849
But it stopped raining, and in a couple
of hours the river will be clear...

489
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:08,395
and we're going to get out of this place.
All of us.

490
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:11,606
It doesn't matter where we go.

491
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:14,359
If we don't do
something right now...

492
00:53:14,526 --> 00:53:17,070
we are all going
to be dead by then!

493
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:56,696
Don't do it, you little bitch!
Don't cut it off!

494
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:06,786
Don't cut it off!

495
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:08,538
Fuck you!

496
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:17,756
No, no, no!

497
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:21,551
No!

498
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:47,952
I had to do it.
And I feel much better now.

499
00:55:00,924 --> 00:55:03,551
Hold on, baby.
Hold on, please.

500
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:07,430
Eric and I are going to
put a stop to this, okay?

501
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,225
I promise that everything
is going to be fine.

502
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,143
Okay? Okay, baby?

503
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:16,064
She just cut her
fucking arm off.

504
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:18,191
Does that sound fine?

505
00:55:28,827 --> 00:55:31,162
These inscriptions
are confusing,

506
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:33,081
sometimes contradictory...

507
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:35,250
but they are consistent
about one thing.

508
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:38,419
In order to stop this,

509
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:41,422
the possessed must be cleansed.

510
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:43,967
Purified.

511
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,845
The book describes
three specific ways.

512
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:51,224
A live burial.

513
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,480
Bodily dismemberment.

514
00:55:57,647 --> 00:55:59,816
<i>Dismemberment.</i>

515
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:06,197
And purification by fire.

516
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:11,494
Are you sure this will work?

517
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:14,998
If we...

518
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:22,005
If I kill my sister,
she will be at peace?

519
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:25,550
Am I sure?
Of course not.

520
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,302
This is not a science book!

521
00:56:28,595 --> 00:56:30,471
But look,
I'm sure of one thing.

522
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:34,893
Whatever is inside Mia
is the cause of all this.

523
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:38,730
If she dies, then this thing
is going to die with her.

524
00:56:38,897 --> 00:56:41,065
What if she just lost her mind?

525
00:56:43,276 --> 00:56:45,111
What if she just
needs a doctor?

526
00:56:45,278 --> 00:56:46,863
What? A doctor?

527
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,366
My mom died in
a mental hospital.

528
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:51,701
She was crazy.

529
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:53,411
She was deranged,

530
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:54,704
she was a monster.

531
00:56:56,581 --> 00:56:57,582
I've always feared that

532
00:56:57,665 --> 00:56:59,459
me and Mia would
end up like her.

533
00:57:08,009 --> 00:57:12,055
You are just a fucking coward.

534
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:14,641
You know exactly
what we have to do...

535
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:17,852
but you're too scared
to go through with it.

536
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:20,563
I'm going to burn
this fucking place down.

537
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:23,358
And I'm going to
end this nightmare.

538
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:27,570
Why don't you just run away?

539
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:31,032
Go hide beneath
some rock somewhere.

540
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:33,534
You know you're great at that.

541
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:41,125
Oh, shit.

542
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,953
Where the fuck did she go?

543
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:00,580
David.

544
00:59:01,998 --> 00:59:04,417
Take it before she does.

545
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:41,120
No!

546
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:45,083
Stop!

547
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:56,094
No, no, no!

548
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:29,085
David.

549
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:38,511
Why are you hurting me?

550
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:48,437
My face hurts.

551
01:00:50,398 --> 01:00:51,649
Why?

552
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:57,113
Why...
Why does my face hurt?

553
01:00:58,739 --> 01:00:59,740
Baby.

554
01:01:01,534 --> 01:01:02,535
Nat.

555
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:40,489
Come on, man.
Here we are.

556
01:01:45,161 --> 01:01:47,371
Hey. Hold on.

557
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:49,832
Don't die on me, please!

558
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:53,127
Dying wouldn't be
so bad right now.

559
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:59,634
I just don't want to
become the devil's bitch.

560
01:02:03,763 --> 01:02:05,514
I'm going to do
what I got to do.

561
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:10,186
I'm going to do
what I got to do. Okay?

562
01:02:58,234 --> 01:02:59,819
I'm sorry, Mia.

563
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,446

Hey. Okay?

David.

583
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:43,102
I missed you, man.

584
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:49,733
You know that, buddy.

585
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,148
David?

586
01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:15,194
David?

587
01:09:15,736 --> 01:09:18,906
I can't move!
I can't breathe!

588
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:20,908
David!

589
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:23,410
Help me!

590
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:26,372
Help me, David!

591
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:28,040
You're not her.

592
01:09:28,207 --> 01:09:29,833
David!

593
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:31,293
Help me!

You're not her!

595
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:42,346
Why do you hate me, David?

596
01:09:44,973 --> 01:09:46,767
I know you do.

597
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:50,104
You left home.

598
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:53,357
You left me all alone

599
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,693
with our sick mother.

600
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:57,444
And I was just a kid.

601
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:00,698
You made me lie.

602
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:04,743
Every time she
screamed your name,

603
01:10:04,827 --> 01:10:07,037
I told her you were
coming to see her.

604
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,249
Like you promised.

605
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:12,668
But you never did.

606
01:10:14,086 --> 01:10:17,047
Please stop it,
I'm begging you.

607
01:10:18,507 --> 01:10:21,635
I know Mother hates you now,

608
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:23,512
and she waits for you in hell.

609
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:35,733
Shut up. Shut up.

610
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:55,043
I'm so sorry.

611
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:00,674
I should have been there.

612
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:05,262
I should have
been there for you.

613
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:02,152
Come on.
Please, come back.

614
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:11,411
Come on, Mia.
Come back to me, please!

615
01:12:55,122 --> 01:12:57,416
Okay, you are at peace.

616
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:00,711
You are at peace now.

Mia?

619
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:44,922
It was so horrible.

620
01:13:46,882 --> 01:13:49,051
It was so horrible.

621
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,305
It's okay.
It's all over now.

622
01:13:56,767 --> 01:13:59,686
Thanks for not
leaving me, David.

623
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:11,073
Wait here. I'm going

Here, take the keys.
Look at me, let's go.

631
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:33,363
Come on. Let's go.

You're going to die here,

<i>I believe I
have made a significant find</i>

653

<i>in the Candarian Ruins...</i>

654
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:36,664
<i>a volume of ancient
Sumerian burial practices</i>

655
01:29:36,747 --> 01:29:38,791
<i>and funerary incantations.</i>

656
01:29:39,417 --> 01:29:42,461
<i>It is entitled
"Naturom Demonto."</i>

657
01:29:42,628 --> 01:29:45,214
<i>Roughly translated,
"Book of the Dead."</i>

658
01:29:45,381 --> 01:29:49,385
<i>The book is bound in human flesh
and inked in human blood.</i>

659
01:29:49,719 --> 01:29:53,014
<i>It deals with demons,
demon resurrection...</i>

660
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:55,099
<i>those forces
which roam the forest</i>

661
01:29:55,224 --> 01:29:57,143
<i>and dark bowers

662
01:29:58,102 --> 01:30:01,147
<i>The first few pages warn that
these enduring creatures...</i>

663
01:30:01,314 --> 01:30:04,317
<i>may lie dormant
but are never truly dead.</i>

664
01:30:04,901 --> 01:30:06,777
<i>They may be recalled
to active life</i>

665
01:30:06,861 --> 01:30:09,363
<i>through the incantations
presented in this book.</i>

666
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:12,074
<i>It is through recitation
of these passages</i>

667
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:13,558
<i>that the demons
are given license...</i>

668
01:30:14,201 --> 01:30:16,162
<i>to possess the living.</i>

669
01:30:49,528 --> 01:30:52,281
<i>I have seen the dark shadows
