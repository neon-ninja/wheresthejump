NARRATOR: <i>This chapter
was the reason</i>

3
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:30,945
<i>we started looking into
this phenomenon...</i>

<i>There were signs everywhere,</i>

saw it coming.</i>

<i>These days...</i>

11
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:13,791
<i>people can't see
when they are preaching hatred.</i>

12
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:19,931
<i>People can't hear when the gods
are fighting each other.</i>

13
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:26,434
<i>And eventually it all
comes down to this city,</i>

14
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:31,839
<i>where there is so much hatred,
it runs deep into the ground,</i>

<i>In 1972,
two priests from Jerusalem</i>

<i>they were all dealing
with the same devil.</i>

44
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:32,429
<i>For hours, they tried

So, Kevin, where are you from?

151
00:10:53,844 --> 00:10:57,011
I'm from all over.
I travel a lot.

152
00:10:57,013 --> 00:10:59,180
So where have you been to?

153
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:01,282
Well, I've lost count.

154
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:03,584
You see, I study anthropology,

155
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:07,322
so I really like traveling,
exploring different cultures,

156
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:09,123
especially ancient ones.

157
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:13,060
- Sounds fascinating.
- Wow. That sounds interesting.

158
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:15,362
I guess that probably
sounds boring to you.

159
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:16,931
No, no, no, no, really.

160
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:19,534
It's actually sounds
really cool.

KEVIN: That's exactly
what I'm saying.

Every religion calls it
in a different name,

167

talking about the same thing.

SARAH: Cool.

169
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:40,856
KEVIN: In Islam,
it's the Dark Angel.

170
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:42,591
For Jews, it's Golem.

171
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:47,529
And in Christianity, it's the
undead or zombies or whatever.

172

00:27:49,257 --> 00:27:52,091
We would like very much
to have a drink with you.

526
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:54,360
You're allowed to have fun
sometimes, aren't you, soldier?

527
00:27:54,362 --> 00:27:58,598
SARAH: We need shots all around
of your best vodka, please.

528
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,466
Hey, do you know these guys?

529
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:04,972
These clowns? They're patroling
around our hostel every day.

530
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,473
Okay, everybody!
Cheers!

531
00:28:07,475 --> 00:28:10,978
Salud... Where are we?
L'chaim!

532
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,550
- Cheers!
- Party!

533
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:24,258
Hey, funny glasses!

534
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,592
[laughter]

535
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:27,595
Gimme, gimme!

536
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:29,930
Hello! Whoo!

537
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:32,398
[kiss]
I love you.

538
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,368
Hi, Sarah! What's up?

539
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,004
KEVIN: I've gotta try them on.

540
00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:41,008
With these glasses,
you look even hotter!

541
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,978
- Very funny.
- No, no! I'm serious!

542
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:49,018
Did anyone ever tell you
how amazingly beautiful you are?

543
00:28:52,588 --> 00:28:55,055
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

544
00:28:55,057 --> 00:28:58,091
- Sarah...
- I don't know.

545
00:28:58,093 --> 00:29:00,627
- Where are you taking me?
- It's a surprise.

546
00:29:00,629 --> 00:29:02,596
Shit, your Facebook's on.

547
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:05,432
- MAN: Need some help?
- KEVIN: Fuck off.

548
00:29:05,434 --> 00:29:11,171
How does it work?
So I just touch the pad here?

549
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:13,173
- Excuse me, sorry.
- Sorry, guys.

550
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:14,843
Sorry.

551
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:20,617
Nice pictures.
Look at you.

552
00:29:24,286 --> 00:29:26,486
Too much clothes.

553
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:29,358
Hey, come here.

554
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:40,736
Don't move.

555
00:29:46,676 --> 00:29:49,175
Hey, what's going on?

556
00:29:49,177 --> 00:29:51,311
What do you think is going on?

557
00:29:51,313 --> 00:29:52,948
I don't know.

558
00:29:58,219 --> 00:30:02,255
So who's the guy
with the stupid hat?

559
00:30:02,257 --> 00:30:04,992
Is he your boyfriend
or something?

560
00:30:04,994 --> 00:30:07,194
- What did you say?
- Looks like a douche.

561
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:09,329
[laughs]

562
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:11,598
What?

563
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,336
Sarah, what?

564
00:30:17,673 --> 00:30:19,572
- Leave me alone!
- Sarah, come back!

565
00:30:19,574 --> 00:30:22,175
It's a joke!

566
00:30:22,177 --> 00:30:24,846
- Sarah, come on.
- Fuck.

567
00:30:26,748 --> 00:30:29,683
- I'm going back to the hostel.
- We're just getting started.

568
00:30:29,685 --> 00:30:31,385
I'll go by myself.

569
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:34,253
- Come on, Sarah. Just hang on.
- No. I'm leaving.

570
00:30:34,255 --> 00:30:35,891
RACHEL: Sarah!

571
00:30:45,201 --> 00:30:47,470
Glass, open navigation.

572
00:30:48,536 --> 00:30:52,271
Glass, open navigation.

573
00:30:52,273 --> 00:30:55,108
Glass. Come on, Glass.

574
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:59,113
Excuse me, sir,
do you know where...

575
00:30:59,115 --> 00:31:00,750
Excuse me.

576
00:31:02,784 --> 00:31:05,454
Sir, excuse me,
do you know where...

577
00:31:08,023 --> 00:31:10,190
Oh, great timing, Dad.

578
00:31:10,192 --> 00:31:12,259
Not now.

579
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:15,128
[distant dog barking]

580
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,665
Shit.

581
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:21,437
Where the fuck am I?

582
00:31:32,048 --> 00:31:33,515
Come on.

583
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,390
Shit.

584
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
MAN: Hey!
- Wait!
- [running footsteps]

585
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,630
- [gasps]
- Hey, it's me.

586
00:31:50,632 --> 00:31:53,502
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

587
00:31:55,236 --> 00:31:58,472
Listen, I'm sorry about
what I said.

588
00:31:58,474 --> 00:32:01,274
It's not your fault.
It's okay.

589
00:32:01,276 --> 00:32:04,278
Guy in the picture
was my brother.

590
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,547
He died in an accident
a year ago and...

591
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,784
[wings flapping]

592
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:14,088
What is it?

593
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,657
No. Nothing.
I thought I heard something.

594
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:20,226
Listen, I'm sorry
about your brother.

595
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:22,261
- I didn't mean to...
- No, it's cool.

596
00:32:22,263 --> 00:32:25,331
I just need to try
and move on with my life.

597
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:28,335
That's the reason
Rache dragged me on this trip.

598
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:32,675
- Take me back to the hostel.
- Yeah, sure.

599
00:32:37,178 --> 00:32:41,248
I'm gonna drink a few gallons
of water and pass out.

600
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,616
You have a nice hangover.

601
00:32:42,618 --> 00:32:45,719
Good night, Indiana.
Thanks for rescuing me.

602
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:47,957
Pleasure was all mine.

603
00:32:51,327 --> 00:32:54,360
Hey, Kevin.

604
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:57,065
Yeah?

605
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:03,505
Let's take that off.
[giggles]

606
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,661
- Do me, Indiana.
- Come here.

607
00:33:40,576 --> 00:33:42,712
SARAH: Hey.

608
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:45,815
Kevin?

609
00:33:49,185 --> 00:33:51,521
Hey, what's up?

610
00:34:00,295 --> 00:34:02,428
What's the matter?

611
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,397
Jet lag?

612
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,967
Some strange noises I heard
woke me up.

613
00:34:07,969 --> 00:34:10,870
Voices?
What are you talking about?

614
00:34:10,872 --> 00:34:13,608
More like distant screams.

615
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:18,844
I'm not making any sense,
am I?

616
00:34:18,846 --> 00:34:22,083
Will you please tell me
what's going on?

617
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:29,556
There's something
I want to show you.

618
00:34:29,558 --> 00:34:31,791
I'm sending you the link.

619
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:33,626
Kevin, you're freaking me out.

620
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:36,630
I found it on the Darknet,
doing my research.

621
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:39,532
Just watch it.

622
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:40,900
Okay.

623
00:34:40,902 --> 00:34:44,438
Glass, open link.

624
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,677
They say it's from
the Vatican's archives.

625
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,715
<i>Representatives from all three
religions are here.</i>

626
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,782
<i>It concerns all of us.</i>

627
00:34:56,784 --> 00:34:59,789
<i>[chanting]</i>

628
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,302
<i>In the name of the Lord,
return to the ground!</i>

629
00:35:15,304 --> 00:35:18,107
<i>[shrieks]</i>

630
00:35:24,947 --> 00:35:27,514
You know this thing is
total bullshit, right?

631
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:28,849
Yeah, I guess so.

632
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:30,616
Okay, so let me see
if I got this straight.

633
00:35:30,618 --> 00:35:32,418
You think that in this city,

634
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,688
people are just coming back
from the dead all the time,

635
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,523
- like coming out of the ground?
- No, not all the time.

636
00:35:37,525 --> 00:35:39,826
According to what I read,
it happened here before.

637
00:35:39,828 --> 00:35:41,427
More than once.

638
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:43,362
So how come
nobody's talking about it?

639
00:35:43,364 --> 00:35:45,666
Maybe all the religious leaders
know something,

640
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:47,534
and they keep it a secret.

641
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:49,001
Kevin, come on. Why?

642
00:35:49,003 --> 00:35:52,038
Maybe they know something
that we don't.

643
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,576
Maybe the resurrection
is gonna happen again.

644
00:35:56,578 --> 00:36:00,713
The undead, the dark angels,
the Nephilim.

645
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:02,648
Just like it says in the Bible.

646
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,351
- Which Bible?
- All of them.

647
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:07,887
Okay, Kevin, it's late

648
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:11,791
and you're freaking me out with
your apocalypse theory, so...

649
00:36:11,793 --> 00:36:15,027
Yeah. It's probably
crazy talk.

650
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:17,396
It's stupid. Never mind.

651
00:36:17,398 --> 00:36:21,500
It's okay, it's cool.
Just get some sleep, Indiana.

652
00:36:21,502 --> 00:36:23,071
Yeah.

653
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:28,577
Good night.

654
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:43,259
[munching]

655
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Glass, close link.

656
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,869
- [speaking Arabic]
- Omar!

657
00:36:56,871 --> 00:36:59,473
It's "good morning" in Arabic.

658
00:36:59,475 --> 00:37:03,009
Sabbach-whatever
to you too.

659
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:05,878
Judging by that smile, I see
it was a good night as well.

660
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,681
Aywa.
That's "yes" in Arabic.

661
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:10,616
I figured.

662
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:12,018
There you are,
you naughty girl.

663
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,520
- Good morning, princess.
- Good morning.

664
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:16,523
Where did you
disappear to last night?

665
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,893
Come on, I want to hear
everything.

666
00:37:19,895 --> 00:37:22,395
[clears throat]

667
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:25,867
Okay, I go.
Squeeze lemonade.

668
00:37:27,136 --> 00:37:29,735
- [sighs]
- Well?

669
00:37:29,737 --> 00:37:33,607
Well, well, um...

670
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:36,442
Let's just say that
lightning struck last night.

671
00:37:36,444 --> 00:37:37,677
Several times.

672
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,612
What about you,
Mrs. Jones?

673
00:37:39,614 --> 00:37:40,880
Uh...

674
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:43,150
No way. Oh, my God!

675
00:37:43,152 --> 00:37:46,853
Somebody's finally starting
to go with the flow!

676
00:37:46,855 --> 00:37:49,124
- [laughing]
- No!

677
00:37:58,132 --> 00:37:59,965
- It's gone, it's nothing.
- My dad's gonna kill me.

678
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I didn't scratch it.
Just try it on.
- Rache...
- It's gone.
- I think it's broken.
- Let's go.

679
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's not working right.
Today Omar takes you
for sightseeing in the old city.
We'll start at the market,
and then we'll go
to the Armenian quarter,

680
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,918
and then we'll go
to the Jewish quarter

681
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,089
and finish with the great...

682
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:26,692
- Opa.
- Hey.

683
00:38:26,694 --> 00:38:30,996
Hello, good morning, neighbor.
Hello.

684
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:34,704
- Glass, take a picture.
- You like what you see?

685
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:39,505
OMAR: I hate these assholes.

686
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:41,107
RACHEL: Really? They seem nice.

687
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:43,210
You Americans are so naïve.

688
00:38:43,212 --> 00:38:45,779
But you know how to party.

689
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,748
SARAH: Kevin, what's up?

690
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,150
What is this place?

691
00:38:51,152 --> 00:38:53,552
OMAR: This?

692
00:38:53,554 --> 00:38:55,521
You don't want to come here,
believe me.

693
00:38:55,523 --> 00:38:59,125
This is, eh...
How you say?

694
00:38:59,127 --> 00:39:02,094
- A cuckoo house.
- SARAH: A cuckoo house?

695
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:05,264
- What, like a mental asylum?
- Yes, for people who go crazy.

696
00:39:05,266 --> 00:39:08,501
There's a lot here in the city
like this.

697
00:39:08,503 --> 00:39:10,570
A lot of tourists come here,

698
00:39:10,572 --> 00:39:12,271
they see their own eyes
what they read in the Bible,

699
00:39:12,273 --> 00:39:14,273
and they go cuckoo-ruckoo.

700
00:39:14,275 --> 00:39:16,543
KEVIN: You mean
Jerusalem Syndrome?

701
00:39:16,545 --> 00:39:20,579
Yes. This city can bring
a lot of madness for the people.

702
00:39:20,581 --> 00:39:21,780
Let's go.

703
00:39:21,782 --> 00:39:23,750
- [loud chatter]
- Sarah, look at me.

704
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:25,820
Oh, wow.

705
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:28,855
Pretty.

706
00:39:28,857 --> 00:39:30,991
"Don't Worry, Be Jewish."

707
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,692
SARAH: I'm so getting that one
for my dad.

708
00:39:33,694 --> 00:39:34,960
See?

709
00:39:34,962 --> 00:39:36,262
What's that?

710
00:39:36,264 --> 00:39:37,898
OMAR: This is where we pray.

711
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,803
SARAH: No way. That's amazing.

712
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:45,170
They're all praying?
They always pray here.

713
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:46,273
KEVIN: Nice dress.

714
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:49,241
Yeah, very.

715
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:51,878
I'm gonna check
how much it is.

716
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,880
No. Kevin, stop.

717
00:39:53,882 --> 00:39:56,849
Don't worry. I got this.

718
00:39:56,851 --> 00:40:00,119
You Jews wear white
on Yom Kippur, right?

719
00:40:00,121 --> 00:40:02,855
Now you have
something to wear.

720
00:40:02,857 --> 00:40:04,793
Thanks, Indiana.

721
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,598
- Rache!
- Is this real leather?

722
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,333
- [bell tolling]
- Wow.

723
00:40:13,335 --> 00:40:14,900
Sarah, you're gonna get lost.
Come on.

724
00:40:14,902 --> 00:40:17,270
Okay, okay.

725
00:40:17,272 --> 00:40:21,544
- Smells like something.
- You smell perfect.

726
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:33,186
Rache, I don't think you're
allowed to do that here.

727
00:40:33,188 --> 00:40:34,523
Put it in your bag.

728
00:40:35,857 --> 00:40:37,157
Western Wall.

729
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:39,192
This is the holiest place
in Israel.

730
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:41,927
- Better give it some respect.
- All right, all right.

731
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:44,297
Rache, you know I don't believe
in that nonsense.

732
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:46,099
Just give it a chance.

733
00:40:46,101 --> 00:40:50,139
Just write down your deepest
and strongest wishes, okay?

734
00:41:02,183 --> 00:41:04,284
All right. Here it is.

735
00:41:04,286 --> 00:41:08,054
Nothing special.
Just world peace.

736
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:09,956
Hope we're good.

737
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,858
- [squawking]
- Whoa.

738
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,893
What the hell?

739
00:41:14,895 --> 00:41:17,332
- What the hell?
- What the fuck?

740
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:22,637
That was creepy.
Let's get out of here.

741
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:26,105
What is this place?

742
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:27,940
Come on, let's go.
Come on, come on.

743
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:32,212
GUIDE: Welcome to
King Solomon's Quarries,

744
00:41:32,214 --> 00:41:36,750
the biggest artificial cave
in the Middle East.

745
00:41:36,752 --> 00:41:38,851
- OMAR: Take helmet.
- GUIDE: Please, everybody,

746
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:43,389
take a helmet
and turn on the headlights.

747
00:41:43,391 --> 00:41:46,125
You know that these are
the exact same flashlights

748
00:41:46,127 --> 00:41:50,764
that were used by King Solomon's
diggers a thousand years ago.

749
00:41:50,766 --> 00:41:54,067
[laughing]

750
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:56,670
- GUIDE: Okay.
- SARAH: That wasn't funny.

751
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
King Solomon was...
[mumbling]
Bla bla bla.
Bla bla bla.

752
00:42:08,784 --> 00:42:11,817
- Boo!
- Rache! Stop doing that!

753
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:13,186
Yeah, I'm a retard, I know.

754
00:42:13,188 --> 00:42:16,358
WOMAN: Excuse me,
I have a question.

755
00:42:18,293 --> 00:42:22,161
SARAH: Hey, Kevin.

756
00:42:22,163 --> 00:42:24,163
Is everything okay?

757
00:42:24,165 --> 00:42:27,568
Yeah, I'm fine. Sure.
Let's go.

758
00:42:29,103 --> 00:42:31,471
This just keeps going
deeper and deeper.

759
00:42:31,473 --> 00:42:34,075
This is insane.

760
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:40,913
Kevin?

761
00:42:40,915 --> 00:42:42,949
Kev? Indiana?

762
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:44,183
KEVIN: I'm here.

763
00:42:44,185 --> 00:42:47,152
Hey. There you are.

764
00:42:47,154 --> 00:42:49,525
What is that?

765
00:43:02,136 --> 00:43:06,405
GUIDE: You can see the peephole,
the eye peek.

766
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:11,110
There are plenty more like this
all around here.

767
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:13,346
KEVIN: This guy is really
starting to bug me.

768
00:43:13,348 --> 00:43:16,014
- Can we get out now?
- Yeah, sure. We're almost done.

769
00:43:16,016 --> 00:43:17,483
GUIDE: Researchers
are still arguing

770
00:43:17,485 --> 00:43:19,319
what these holes are for.

771
00:43:19,321 --> 00:43:21,189
Some say it's for...

772
00:43:23,357 --> 00:43:24,891
SARAH: What's wrong?

773
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,460
I'm suffocating in here.
I can't breathe.

774
00:43:27,462 --> 00:43:31,163
Oh, my God. It's okay.
Come on, it's okay.

775
00:43:31,165 --> 00:43:33,532
- Hey, are you good, white boy?
- Yeah, yeah, you guys go on.

776
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:35,400
- We're fine.
- Are you sure?

777
00:43:35,402 --> 00:43:37,270
Yeah, yeah. We're just gonna
go out for some air, okay?

778
00:43:37,272 --> 00:43:39,139
We'll meet you
back at the hostel.

779
00:43:39,141 --> 00:43:41,040
Come on, Kevin.
Everything's okay.

780
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:43,278
I'll take you outside.

781
00:43:44,411 --> 00:43:46,246
- It's okay.
- KEVIN: Come on, Sarah.

782
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:49,449
- Everything's okay.
- No, it's not.

783
00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:51,951
I'm going to the city archives
to check the books.

784
00:43:51,953 --> 00:43:54,788
Kevin.
Kevin, wait for me.

785
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,157
- Hey, Kevin!
- Something's not right.

786
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:00,058
Hey, wait up!
Hey, Kevin!

787
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,862
Oh, God.
That cave was insane, wasn't it?

788
00:44:02,864 --> 00:44:04,329
Yeah, it was nice.

789
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:05,565
Too bad you guys weren't there
waiting for us.

790
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:07,933
Omar took us to the best
hummus place.

791
00:44:07,935 --> 00:44:10,469
Kevin needed some air.
I'm really worried about him.

792
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:13,907
Listen, Rache, I think we got
Jerusalem covered.

793
00:44:13,909 --> 00:44:15,942
I mean, I was talking to Kevin,

794
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,543
and we're thinking of going
to Tel Aviv tomorrow night.

795
00:44:17,545 --> 00:44:19,012
What do you think?

796
00:44:19,014 --> 00:44:21,047
Why? The vacation's
just beginning.

797
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:22,382
Are you serious?

798
00:44:22,384 --> 00:44:24,349
Now I want to stay,
and you want to go?

799
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:27,954
Rache, there's something weird
about this place.

800
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,290
Or maybe you two are developing
Jerusalem Syndrome,

801
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,458
- and you are going crazy.
- Fuck you, Rache, I'm serious.

802
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,396
Oh, God, Sarah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm kidding,

803
00:44:37,398 --> 00:44:39,364
It's my bad joke.
I'm sorry.

804
00:44:39,366 --> 00:44:41,433
Okay.

805
00:44:41,435 --> 00:44:44,337
Look, the whole city's
shut down now anyway, okay?

806
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:46,973
So the second Yom Kippur
is over, we're outta here.

807
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,244
Promise? Hmm?

808
00:44:56,585 --> 00:44:58,016
[banging on door]

809
00:44:58,018 --> 00:44:59,518
KEVIN: Sarah, Rachel, open up!

810
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,587
RACHEL: Sarah, what's going on
out there?

811
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:04,891
You have to pack now!
We have to leave!

812
00:45:04,893 --> 00:45:07,159
SARAH: Why? What happened?
I don't understand.

813
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:08,594
Kevin, listen to me.
Everything's gonna be fine.

814
00:45:08,596 --> 00:45:10,295
We're gonna go to Tel Aviv
tomorrow night.

815
00:45:10,297 --> 00:45:12,232
There's not gonna be
tomorrow night!

816
00:45:12,234 --> 00:45:14,099
- What are you talking about?
- I know you think I'm crazy.

817
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:16,369
Something bad is happening
here, Sarah! Pack up!

818
00:45:16,371 --> 00:45:18,137
Kevin! Kevin don't!

819
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:21,174
- RACHEL: What the fuck?!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

820
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,076
Kevin!

821
00:45:23,078 --> 00:45:25,578
You have to believe me
'cause they won't.

822
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,980
SARAH: I don't understand
what you're talking about.

823
00:45:27,982 --> 00:45:30,049
Omar, Fauzi, everything's okay.
I got this.

824
00:45:30,051 --> 00:45:33,085
- [speaking Arabic]
- KEVIN: Sarah, tell them to go.

825
00:45:33,087 --> 00:45:36,021
Listen, Kevin, everything's
gonna be fine, okay?

826
00:45:36,023 --> 00:45:37,924
- Just calm down.
- [speaking Arabic]

827
00:45:37,926 --> 00:45:40,058
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

828
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,996
KEVIN: Sarah, listen to me!

829
00:45:42,998 --> 00:45:45,163
- We have to leave!
- Were there any signs before?

830
00:45:45,165 --> 00:45:47,300
It's important
for you to remember.

831
00:45:47,302 --> 00:45:49,201
SARAH: I don't know.
He just started talking funny,

832
00:45:49,203 --> 00:45:52,304
and then all of a sudden...
I don't know. I don't know.

833
00:45:52,306 --> 00:45:54,040
Everything will be okay.
Don't worry.

834
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,507
KEVIN: Get your hands off me!

835
00:45:55,509 --> 00:45:57,610
- Kevin, my friend, come.
- No, no, no, no!

836
00:45:57,612 --> 00:46:00,445
SARAH: Hey, Fauzi, stop.

837
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,081
Hey, guys, where are you
taking him?

838
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:05,684
OMAR: Come with us. Don't worry.
Everything will be okay.

839
00:46:05,686 --> 00:46:09,323
Come, come.
Watch the steps. Come.

840
00:46:16,464 --> 00:46:18,901
Are you okay, ladies?

841
00:46:27,475 --> 00:46:29,675
We have a saying here:

842
00:46:29,677 --> 00:46:32,045
"If you're talking to God,
it's good.

843
00:46:32,047 --> 00:46:35,648
But if God is talking to you,
then you have problem."

844
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,683
- Where have they taken him?
- Don't worry.

845
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:40,987
He will rest a few days,
and he will be as good as new.

846
00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:44,991
That's what usually happens
to people who go [whistles].

847
00:46:44,993 --> 00:46:46,592
It's not the first time
it's happened here, is it?

848
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:52,030
No. This happens a lot here,
especially to Catholics.

849
00:46:52,032 --> 00:46:54,567
Go figure.

850
00:46:54,569 --> 00:46:58,874
Anyway, I see you later,
ladies? Hmm?

851
00:47:01,042 --> 00:47:03,108
Don't worry.
He will be just fine.

852
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,543
RACHEL: The second Yom Kippur
is over,

853
00:47:04,545 --> 00:47:06,311
we're on the first bus
out of this place.

854
00:47:06,313 --> 00:47:09,014
- We're restarting this trip.
- What about Kevin?

855
00:47:09,016 --> 00:47:11,083
You heard what Omar said.
He's gonna be fine.

856
00:47:11,085 --> 00:47:13,186
Just give him a couple of days.
He's gonna be as good as new.

857
00:47:13,188 --> 00:47:14,686
Don't worry.

858
00:47:14,688 --> 00:47:16,221
Okay.

859
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,224
Okay. Let's go get some rest.

860
00:47:18,226 --> 00:47:19,659
It's Judgment Day tonight,

861
00:47:19,661 --> 00:47:22,261
and God knows I've got
a lot of sins to redeem.

862
00:47:22,263 --> 00:47:23,497
Yeah, right.

863
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:28,400
Listen, I'll meet you
back at the room, okay?

864
00:47:28,402 --> 00:47:29,971
Okay.

865
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

01:05:36,322 --> 01:05:38,322
They're trained
for every scenario.

1212
01:05:38,324 --> 01:05:40,491
So don't be afraid, okay?

1213
01:05:40,493 --> 01:05:42,494
- Not for this one.
- Yehuda, shut up.

1214
01:05:42,496 --> 01:05:44,295
[speaking Hebrew]

1215
01:05:44,297 --> 01:05:46,566
All these things
happening tonight?

1216
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:51,335
They teach us at school
to be good kids

1217
01:05:51,337 --> 01:05:54,572
because on Yom Kippur,
Judgment Day...

1218
01:05:54,574 --> 01:05:57,275
It's religious bullshit.
[speaking Hebrew]

1219
01:05:57,277 --> 01:05:59,277
The sky is opening up,

1220
01:05:59,279 --> 01:06:01,480
and God judges everyone,

1221
01:06:01,482 --> 01:06:03,882
our sins and our good deeds.

1222
01:06:03,884 --> 01:06:06,150
SARAH: Yehuda, what are you
talking about?

1223
01:06:06,152 --> 01:06:09,320
But it's not the sky
that is opening up tonight.

1224
01:06:09,322 --> 01:06:11,489
- It's the ground.
- [speaking Hebrew]

1225
01:06:11,491 --> 01:06:14,358
- SARAH: Tomer, that's enough!
- KEVIN: Let him talk.

1226
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,329
I have no idea
what's happening tonight.

1227
01:06:17,331 --> 01:06:18,896
I just know
I'm shitting my pants.

1228
01:06:18,898 --> 01:06:21,366
TOMER: Yehuda!
[speaking Hebrew]

1229
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:24,268
OMAR: [speaking Arabic]
We all had enough of you.

1230
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:27,371
[speaking Hebrew]

1231
01:06:27,373 --> 01:06:29,674
- RACHEL: Cool it, guys.
- SARAH: Stop it, okay?

1232
01:06:29,676 --> 01:06:32,511
[speaking Hebrew]

1233
01:06:32,513 --> 01:06:34,612
Omar, please.
Just cut it out, okay?

1234
01:06:34,614 --> 01:06:36,248
[speaking Hebrew]

1235
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,183
OMAR: It isn't right
to talk like this.

1236
01:06:38,185 --> 01:06:39,617
My family's here
for 20 generations.

1237
01:06:39,619 --> 01:06:41,619
- Guys, cool it.
- [speaking Arabic]

1238

1239
01:06:44,223 --> 01:06:46,625
[shouting]

1240
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:47,858
Calm down!
Hey! Come on!

1241
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,895
You shut up, you Arab fucker!

1242
01:06:49,897 --> 01:06:51,395
RACHEL: What?

1243
01:06:51,397 --> 01:06:53,900
- Cool it!
- Shut up!

1244
01:06:58,404 --> 01:07:00,271
These glasses are killing me.

1245
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:02,507
I don't think we're gonna
get out of here, Rache.

1246
01:07:02,509 --> 01:07:04,342
Hey.

1247
01:07:04,344 --> 01:07:05,610
Stop.

1248
01:07:05,612 --> 01:07:08,413
Look, I got your back, okay?

1249
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:10,415
We're gonna make it
out of this...

1250
01:07:10,417 --> 01:07:12,284
the way we always do.

1251
01:07:12,286 --> 01:07:13,317
Okay.

1252
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:14,886
You guys okay?

1253
01:07:14,888 --> 01:07:17,788
Remind me to never take
travel advice from you again.

1254
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:21,226
We've got to figure out a way
to get outside these walls.

1255
01:07:21,228 --> 01:07:22,626
How? We're surrounded
by soldiers,

1256
01:07:22,628 --> 01:07:23,862
and the gates are closed.

1257
01:07:23,864 --> 01:07:25,730
FAUZI: I have idea.
There is a way.

1258
01:07:25,732 --> 01:07:27,431
- Crazy. It won't work.
- What?

1259
01:07:27,433 --> 01:07:31,436
[speaking Arabic]

1260
01:07:31,438 --> 01:07:32,770
SARAH: What?

1261
01:07:32,772 --> 01:07:34,538
When he was a kid,
he used to smuggle food...

1262
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,907
He wants to go out
through the caves.

1263
01:07:36,909 --> 01:07:38,742
But it's one big maze
down there.

1264
01:07:38,744 --> 01:07:44,648
[speaking Arabic]

1265
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:46,250
It was 40 years ago,

1266
01:07:46,252 --> 01:07:47,751
but he thinks he can
remember the way out.

1267
01:07:47,753 --> 01:07:49,420
TOMER: Oh, he thinks!

1268
01:07:49,422 --> 01:07:51,389
SARAH: Okay, what are we
waiting for? Let's go.

1269
01:07:51,391 --> 01:07:53,824
What? You wanna go down to those
caves with those creatures?

1270
01:07:53,826 --> 01:07:54,992
No fucking way.

1271
01:07:54,994 --> 01:07:56,695
Rache, if we stay here,
we die.

1272
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:59,663
My dad is right.
The only way out of this city

1273
01:07:59,665 --> 01:08:01,632
is down the caves
and under the walls.

1274
01:08:01,634 --> 01:08:03,867
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- But it's so stupid!

1275
01:08:03,869 --> 01:08:06,737
Sounds like a plan.
A stupid one, but a plan.

1276
01:08:06,739 --> 01:08:08,440
Get ready.
We're moving. Come on.

1277
01:08:08,442 --> 01:08:11,342
[speaking Hebrew]

1278
01:08:11,344 --> 01:08:13,612
- SARAH: Okay, let's go.
- RACHEL: Guys?

1279
01:08:13,614 --> 01:08:14,980
- What?
- What is it?

1280
01:08:14,982 --> 01:08:16,681
- Guys!
- Rache, what is it?

1281
01:08:16,683 --> 01:08:18,650
- OMAR: What is it, Rachel?
- You gotta see this.

1282
01:08:18,652 --> 01:08:20,720
SARAH: I don't see anything.

1283
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Glass, zoom in.
What is that?
- [roaring]
- [screaming]

1284
01:08:31,498 --> 01:08:33,534
Rache! Rache!

1285
01:08:34,601 --> 01:08:37,204
KEVIN: Let's go, guys!
Hurry up!

1286
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:41,506
- [shouting]
- Let's go! Omar!

1287
01:08:41,508 --> 01:08:43,742
- [air raid sirens blaring]
- [gunfire, explosions]

1288
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:46,546
Rache, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1289
01:08:51,485 --> 01:08:53,417
- Come on.
- Let's go! Come on. Go!

1290
01:08:53,419 --> 01:08:56,820
- Omar.
- [speaking Arabic]

1291
01:08:56,822 --> 01:08:58,790
SARAH: What's the matter?

1292
01:08:58,792 --> 01:09:01,525
Guys? Why have you stopped?

1293
01:09:01,527 --> 01:09:04,197
[speaking Hebrew]

1294
01:09:07,534 --> 01:09:09,501
What's going on?

1295
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:12,805
[speaking Hebrew]

1296
01:09:19,745 --> 01:09:22,646
[coughing]

1297
01:09:22,648 --> 01:09:26,484
Rache. Rache?
Are you okay?

1298
01:09:26,486 --> 01:09:27,952
Yeah.

1299
01:09:27,954 --> 01:09:29,554
It's okay.

1300
01:09:29,556 --> 01:09:31,191
It's okay.

1301
01:09:35,562 --> 01:09:36,894
Hey.

1302
01:09:36,896 --> 01:09:38,662
See the street?

1303
01:09:38,664 --> 01:09:40,431
It's the Via Delarosa.

1304
01:09:40,433 --> 01:09:43,100
It's about 600 meters
to the cave entrance.

1305
01:09:43,102 --> 01:09:45,569
We're almost there.
Don't worry.

1306
01:09:45,571 --> 01:09:48,540
Everything will be fine.

1307
01:09:48,542 --> 01:09:50,110
Yeah.

1308
01:09:51,578 --> 01:09:52,877
SARAH: Rache?

1309
01:09:52,879 --> 01:09:55,880
- What have you got there?
- What?

1310
01:09:55,882 --> 01:09:58,449
Oh, my God.

1311
01:09:58,451 --> 01:10:00,452
I'm fine. It's nothing.

1312
01:10:00,454 --> 01:10:01,988
Kevin?

1313
01:10:03,789 --> 01:10:05,457
It's nothing.

1314
01:10:05,459 --> 01:10:07,591
What?

1315
01:10:07,593 --> 01:10:09,394
Well, what? Talk to me.

1316
01:10:09,396 --> 01:10:11,496
SARAH: Nothing.
Are you feeling okay?

1317
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:13,497
Yes! I told you I'm fine!
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1318
01:10:13,499 --> 01:10:16,169
Nothing.
It's just a scratch.

1319
01:10:18,771 --> 01:10:21,007
Use this.

1320
01:10:26,612 --> 01:10:28,613
So what do we do now?

1321
01:10:28,615 --> 01:10:30,482
I don't know.

1322
01:10:30,484 --> 01:10:32,917
I think we have
to tell the others.

1323
01:10:32,919 --> 01:10:34,586
What?

1324
01:10:34,588 --> 01:10:37,055
Before it's too late.
We have to tell them.

1325
01:10:37,057 --> 01:10:38,422
No fucking way.

1326
01:10:38,424 --> 01:10:41,458
- Listen.
- No, just listen to me.

1327
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,461
I don't trust these guys, okay?

1328
01:10:43,463 --> 01:10:46,131
They're soldiers.
They're gonna kill her.

1329
01:10:46,133 --> 01:10:48,832
This thing is contagious.

1330
01:10:48,834 --> 01:10:51,668
You saw what happened
at the asylum.

1331
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:54,939
She'll become violent soon.
We have to do something

1332
01:10:54,941 --> 01:10:57,442
or none of us is getting
out of those caves alive.

1333
01:10:57,444 --> 01:10:59,443
That's why we need
to get her to a doctor now.

1334
01:10:59,445 --> 01:11:02,447
- She'll be fine.
- It's too dangerous.

1335
01:11:02,449 --> 01:11:04,849
So what are you gonna do?
We're just gonna leave her here?

1336
01:11:04,851 --> 01:11:06,650
Maybe.

1337
01:11:06,652 --> 01:11:09,019
I don't know.

1338
01:11:09,021 --> 01:11:11,257
Just like they left you?

1339
01:11:16,663 --> 01:11:19,530
You listen to me.

1340
01:11:19,532 --> 01:11:22,065
You owe me, okay?
I saved your ass.

1341
01:11:22,067 --> 01:11:25,470
So you just shut up
and do this for my friend.

1342
01:11:25,472 --> 01:11:27,905
OMAR: Guys, come on!

1343
01:11:27,907 --> 01:11:30,542
Okay, guys.

1344
01:11:30,544 --> 01:11:32,810
Guys, come on.
We don't have time.

1345
01:11:32,812 --> 01:11:34,445
SARAH: Okay, we're coming.

1346
01:11:34,447 --> 01:11:37,015
- [speaking Arabic]
- Go, go, go!

1347
01:11:37,017 --> 01:11:38,582
Rache, come on.
We gotta go.

1348
01:11:38,584 --> 01:11:40,217
Let's get the fuck
out of this city, okay?

1349
01:11:40,219 --> 01:11:41,618
Okay.

1350
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:43,520
YEHUDA: Come on! Come on!

1351
01:11:43,522 --> 01:11:45,191

Let's go.

Rache. Oh, my God.

- Rache, are you okay?
- What's wrong?

1356
01:12:00,173 --> 01:12:01,672
Wait. Just give her
a minute, okay?

1357
01:12:01,674 --> 01:12:03,942
Just give her a second.
She'll be okay.

1358
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:05,877
Rache. Oh, shit.

1359
01:12:05,879 --> 01:12:08,246
Oh, my God. Rache.

- Rache. You okay?

1361
01:12:11,218 --> 01:12:13,984
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God.

1362
01:12:13,986 --> 01:12:16,720
- Turn around.
- RACHEL: Fuck you, asshole.

1363

- [speaking Hebrew]
- SARAH: No, Yehuda.

1364
01:12:19,258 --> 01:12:21,493
- I said turn around.
- Listen. No, listen, please.

1365
01:12:21,495 --> 01:12:23,027
Please. I'm begging you.
Please don't.

1366
01:12:23,029 --> 01:12:25,028
Please. I'm begging you.

1367
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:27,732
Hey! Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

1368
01:12:27,734 --> 01:12:29,667
- [screams]
- Rachel!

1369
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:31,735
Oh, my God. Kevin!

1370
01:12:31,737 --> 01:12:32,936
Kevin, help!

1371
01:12:32,938 --> 01:12:34,671
What the fuck is going on here?

1372
01:12:34,673 --> 01:12:36,741
- Move aside.
- Put it down!

1373
01:12:36,743 --> 01:12:37,908
I said move aside.

1374
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:39,676
- Put it down!
- No.

1375
01:12:39,678 --> 01:12:41,746
You have three seconds,
or I'll shoot both of you.

1376
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:43,483
Move aside!

1377
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:46,887

Listen to me.
I'm sorry,

1381
