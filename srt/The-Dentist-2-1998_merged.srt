3
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,394
Open wide, Brooke.

4
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,025
Wider.

5
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,491
Brooke: You know
I don't want you anymore.

6
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,709
( Laughing )

7
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,401
I, I didn't do that...

8
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,739
A stranger...

9
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,748
A stranger, Doctor?

10
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:49,169
I can remember those
awful things I did,

11
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,880
but for the life of me...
Doctor...

12
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,967
I don't know the man
who did them.

13
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:01,556
This stranger,
this evil Dr. Feinstone,

14
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,183
where is he now?

15
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:08,313
Gone, consumed by the...

16
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,231
rage that spawned him.

17
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,359
By that, you mean it's over,

18
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,403
you put your anger and
your wife's infidelity behind you?

19
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:39,803
No Dr., it is not over.
It will never be over.

20
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,139
Every second of every day...

21
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,603
asleep or awake, I see her face.

22
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,940
The faces of all of my victims.

23
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,319
You refer to them as
''your victims'',

24
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,614
even though you say you don't know
the stranger who hurt them.

25
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,580
He is me.

26
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,127
I am him.

27
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,719
Still he remains...

28
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,850
until love returns the soft...

29
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,311
whisper of his voice...

30
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,566
searching...

31
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,192
wanting...

32
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,195
that which he hath given...

33
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,116
with no reply.

34
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,792
And he is gone?

35
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,882
He is under control.
Shall we go?

36
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,219
Radio: Dr. Alan Feinstone,
the notorious psycho dentist,

37
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:07,057
broke out of the state mental facility
at Indio yesterday afternoon.

38
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,393
His hostage,
Psychiatrist Dr. Genevieve Cussler--

39
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,523
( Opera plays )

40
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,951
Man: So, you think
before the Doc went postal

41
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,913
he was socking money
away from you and the IRS?

42
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,709
And from you, his devoted
wife and help mate.

43
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,379
Excuse my bad manners,
but did he do that to you?

44
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,840
Cut your tongue out?

45
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,555
What a world, huh?

46
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,602
These are all his, huh?

47
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,273
Souvenirs from a trip
he took as a kid.

48
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,403
South Dakota.

49
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,531
Nebraska.

50
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,452
Missouri.

51
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,915
Jeeze, look at these
snow domes...

52
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,544
Oh, a set of
safety deposit box keys.

53
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,217
The answer's in
the postcards, huh?

54
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,220
All right.

55
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:20,482
They found the shrink's car
abandoned in Flagstaff.

56
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,526
Along with 7OO or so bucks
from her wallet.

57
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,362
Jeeze, he could be
just about anywhere.

58
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,927
- Bye, now.
- Thank you.

59
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,500
Mr. Wilkes?

60
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,468
Well, I'll be--
Larry Caine, come on in.

61
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,346
How long has it been,
five years?

62
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,348
It's good to see you.

63
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,225
Well, to what do we owe
this great pleasure?

64
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,102
Rush hour traffic.

65
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,689
Does that come with
an explanation?

66
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,278
Well, my car overheated
on the Alexandria bridge...

67
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,613
It was the morning rush hour,
that was it.

68
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,616
I couldn't face another
jawing mouth, another bicuspid,

69
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,454
I was weary of my life,
the city,

70
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:02,042
the moral decay that passes
as sophistication.

71
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,670
Felt like that myself some days.

72
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,674
So, I left my car
right there on the bridge...

73
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,427
I walked home, I called my lawyer...

74
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,387
and a long story short,
here I am.

75
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,974
Small town, honest people,
clean living.

76
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,102
But, I've got me a little
problem, ol' buddy...

77
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,482
( Intercom buzzes )
Yeah, Jeremy?

78
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,109
Bev, see if you can get
Harry and his drill over here.

79
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,612
Dr. Caine has lost the key
to his safety deposit box.

80
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,405
All righty.

81
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,075
It's a little irregular,
but here it is.

82
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,035
Thanks.

83
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,829
So, what are your plans, Larry?

84
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:43,500
Oh, to live in Paradise.

85
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,960
Great golf just outside of town.

86
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,129
I detest golf.

87
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,633
We'll change that.
Where are you staying?

88
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,468
The Paradise Motel.

89
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,303
The hell you are.

90
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,520
( Sinister chuckle )

91
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,564
Ahh, yes.

92
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,820
Jamie, have you rented the cottage?

93
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,488
No, not yet.

94
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,365
There's someone I want you
to meet. Come with me.

95
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,542
Larry?

96
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,794
Yeah, I'll be right with you.

97
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,382
Jamie Devers...
Dr. Lawrence Caine.

98
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,509
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

99
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:39,681
Yes, Jeremy tells me that
you're his favorite niece.

100
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,350
I'm his only niece.

101
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,271
Larry has just moved
here to Paradise,

102
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,356
lock, stock and barrel,

103
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,443
from that eastern den
of iniquity, Washington, D.C.

104
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:56,239
Actually I left the lock,
stock and barrel behind.

105
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,034
You've got the empty cottage.

106
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,411
I thought maybe you could
show it to Larry during lunch.

107
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,329
Uh, it's really small.

108
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,457
Well, it's just me.

109
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,336
This was my parents' house.

110
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,841
It's where I grew up.
And there's the cottage.

111
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,139
I'll take it.

112
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,151
No. No.

113
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,737
You having trouble sleeping, Doc?

114
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,954
I sure would if I were you.

115
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,958
Go away! Go away!

116
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,337
When it comes right down to it,
Caine is just a Feinstone.

117
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,799
And we all know what
a Feinstone is, don't we?

118
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,526
Do it, do it.

119
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,613
( Sighing with pleasure )

120
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,033
Yes, bleed.

121
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,954
( Knock at door )
Hello?

122
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,916
Larry?

123
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,426
Larry?

124
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,496
( Distorted )
I came running over here.
I was worried.

125
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,791
( Normal voice ) I came running
over because I heard this loud noise.

126
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,336
I didn't know what to think.

127
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,713
I'm in unfamiliar
surroundings and...

128
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:22,093
I must have bumped into the dresser
on my way to the bathroom....

129
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,928
I can replace it.

130
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,931
Don't worry about it.
I can make another one.

131
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,517
- You made it?
- Yeah.

132
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,478
Here, let me do that.

133
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,563
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

134
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:39,402
A little housework
always relaxes me.

135
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,863
Do you do windows?

136
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,240
As a matter of fact, I do.

137
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,952
Good, I think we're going
to get along just fine then.

138
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,373
- Good night.
- Good night.

139
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:59,089
In town, I think it's called
the ''Paradise Cafe''...

140
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,924
is it any good?

141
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,553
After graduate school in Seattle,

142
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:09,265
and a few lost years
contemplating the meaning of art,

143
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,936
in a world that was
consumed by commercialism...

144
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,648
I came to the realization that
actually creating my pottery

145
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,567
was more important
than thinking about it.

146
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:24,280
And so, here I am
back in Paradise,

147
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:28,660
bank teller by day,
artist by night.

148
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,539
Chicken fried steak
for the gentleman,

149
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,833
spinach salad for Jamie.

150
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,961
No wonder you stay so thin, darling.

151
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,255
Anything else?

152
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,180
Something wrong, sir?

153
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,312
No, no, I was just contemplating
a side of curly fries...

154
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:00,692
but I decided against it,
thank you.

155
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,904
Well, enjoy your dinner, folks.

156
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,614
Thanks.

157
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:12,037
So, you're fleeing reality
in search of a dream,

158
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,498
and I'm fleeing a dream
in search of reality.

159
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,960
What dream are you fleeing from?

160
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,630
My wife was a former
Miss Maryland,

161
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:29,721
thus we were the perfect couple
for the perfect dinner party.

162
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,640
You fled from that?

163
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,226
Did I mention the former
Miss Maryland

164
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,979
was attending parties
without me in the afternoons

165
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,983
thrown by younger male members
of the foreign diplomatic corp.

166
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,489
Yet, still he remains...

167
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:53,161
until love returns the soft
whisper of his voice.

168
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,872
Wanting, searching...

169
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:59,876
that which he has given
without return.

170
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,090
To Paradise.

171
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:11,554
May we, um... both find here
what we're looking for.

172
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,572
Larry, you okay?

173
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,866
Larry, what's wrong?

174
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,670
I lost a cap.

175
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,289
One of my caps has come loose.

176
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,416
We didn't put that in.

177
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,919
Yes, I know, I'd like the doctor
to re-cement it, please.

178
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,926

00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,283
( Phone rings )

180
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,359
( Sound of heart beating )

181
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,363
( Inner voice )
Don't do it.

182
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,658
Don't... don't do it.

183
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,123
Oh, God.

184
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,048
Oh, that's good.

185
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,595
Send in the next patient, please.

186
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,472
Please have a seat.

187
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,142
This won't hurt a bit.

188
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,395
Have you been drilled on before?
Would you like some gas?

189
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,817
Open wide, wider...

190
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:19,576
You have to stop moving.
If you move, I cannot proceed.

191
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,579
Why are you moving?
Why is everything moving?

192
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:28,126
Please, sit down. Don't move.
You've got to sit still.

193
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,720
( Phone ringing )

194
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,266
Woman answers:
Doctor's office.

195
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,643
Hello, Mrs. Anderson.
Appointment for when...

196
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,933
Hey!

197
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,103
What are you doing
with my patient?

198
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:32,232
Remove this cotton from your
mouth ma'am, so you don't choke.

199
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,694
What's going on here, what... ?

200
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,785
Relax a minute, dear, while I...

201
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,711
Bernice, look after Edna there.

202
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,131
Who the hell do you think you are?

203
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,050
That woman was in
respiratory distress.

204
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,261
Respiratory distress?

205
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,471
So, you're a doctor, that it?

206
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:07,892
Traveling the country saving poor
souls from respiratory distress?

207
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,644
I am a dentist.

208
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,688
Then you should know better
than to be poking around

209
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,065
in another dentist's business.

210
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,740
You going to wash your hands?
How about some gloves?

211
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,327
Bernice, would you bring
that box of gloves?

212
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:32,042
I'd appreciate it if you'd sterilize
your instruments one more time.

213
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,585
Anything else, doctor?

214
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,463
Perhaps the equipment
is too old for your liking,

215
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:40,008
or maybe you miss the music,
is that it?

216
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,261
You like a little elevator
music with your dentistry?

217
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,056
How about some Lysol
in the cabinets?

218
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,858
Sure you want me to put
in your cap?

219
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,402
You're the only game in town.

220
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,364
Yes, I am.

221
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,244
Open up.

222
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,085
This is a country practice, doctor.

223
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:18,254
Granted, it's plain and simple,

224
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:21,800
but the folks around here seem
to like it just fine.

225
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,803
So, I'd be obliged, city boy,

226
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,430
if you'd keep your opinions
to yourself

227
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:31,267
and your fingers out of
my patients' mouths.

228
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,226
( Continues honking )

229
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:21,818
Asshole.

230
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,153
Cretin.

231
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,126
Burns.

232
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,212
Burns!

233
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,966
( Country music playing )

234
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,987
You incompetent buffoon.

235
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,406
What are you doing here?

236
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,033
Look at this.

237
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,827
What did you use, library paste?

238
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:15,205
And you call yourself a dentist?

239
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:18,625
You stay away from me.
Bernice! Bernice!

240
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,711
Oh, Bernice is out to lunch.

241
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,713
In more ways than one.

242
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:27,217
Drill 'em,
fill 'em, bill 'em...

243
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:31,513
that's your philosophy, huh?

244
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:35,016
You know, you and your
ilk, Doctor Burns...

245
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:37,394
make dentists the boogeymen
of medicine.

246
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,729
Something to be feared...

247
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,482
to be avoided at all costs.

248
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:49,197
I've worked my entire career
to change all that.

249
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:55,578
You see, a trip to the dentist
should be pleasant,

250
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:58,998
something to look forward to.

251
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:06,089
That is, of course, if the dentist
in question is competent.

252
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:10,051
It's not the cap,
you're a fruitcake.

253
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,555
Funny you should mention that.

254
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,223
You're scaring me.

255
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,561
I'm trying to.

256
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:25,692
Now, repeat after me,
''I am an incompetent dentist...''

257
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:26,901
Say it.

258
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:31,906
I... am...
an incompetent dentist.

259
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,408
Now...

260
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,243
- I...
- I...

261
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:36,661
- am...
- am...

262
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,288
- a...
- a...

263
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,998
bogeyman.

264
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,317
I can deal with this.

265
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,243
( Opera music plays )

266
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:05,792
( Phone rings )

267
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:10,380
Your call is being answered by
a machine, please leave a message.

268
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:15,552
Love and kisses from
your favorite private eye.

269
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:19,347
I'm in Grand Junction, Colorado.

270
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:24,519
No luck so far,
next stop is North Platt, Nebraska.

271
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,689
Up with people.

272
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,399
Ciao, baby.

273
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,379
Too bad about Doc Burns, isn't it?

274
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:54,382
Yes. Yes it is.

275
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:57,802
And too bad for Paradise.

276
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,763
The answer is no, Jeremy.

277
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:04,601
Well, I didn't get where I am
by accepting no for an answer.

278
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:12,359
I have a responsibility. What kind of
town would this be without a dentist?

279
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,779
You won't even consider it?

280
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,572
No.

281
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,741
Just till we find somebody.

282
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,452
What part of ''no'' don't
you understand, Jeremy?

283
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:39,969
I did not give up a
lucrative practice in Washington

284
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:43,139
to start from scratch
somewhere else.

285
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,934
Sweet deal for somebody,

286
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:48,603
house, practice,
everything for a song.

287
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:51,731
Promise me you'll
at least think it over.

288
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,661
Afternoon, doctor.

289
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:10,417
Let me show you around.

290
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:19,092
A little spackle, fresh coat of paint,
maybe some new carpeting,

291
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:22,929
you've got yourself
one fine, little office here.

292
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:30,145
Come on in, city boy.
( Laughing )

293
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,732
( Laughing )

294
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:47,037
Feinstone her, Dr. Caine.
Feinstone the bitch.

295
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,874
No, no, no...no.

296
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:09,017
Hey.

297
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,355
You're home early.

298
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,648
I wasn't feeling well.

299
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,567
What's wrong?

300
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:21,404
Um, a toothache. It's nothing.

301
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:25,617
I have an appointment Saturday
with Dr. Davis over in Otis.

302
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,411
That's 7O miles away.

303
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,250
May I look at it?

304
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:27,137
All right.
Want to open for me?

305
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:31,599
( Inner voices )
Feinstone her, Dr. Caine.
Feinstone the bitch.

306
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,395
Are you okay, Larry?

307
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:39,816
I'm fine, just open,
open wide, Jamie.

308
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,120
Sensitive?

309
00:31:56,207 --> 00:32:01,338
It's nothing serious. You just have
a small cavity near the gum line.

310
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:05,425
And, um, I think it's
best if we fill it.

311
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,135
Is it going to hurt?

312
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:10,805
Shouldn't.

313
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,438
Want to open wide?

314
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:23,276
All right, turn your head a little
this way. There we go.

315
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:38,375
That's it.

316
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,878
That's it?
I didn't even feel it.

317
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,838
You're not supposed to.

318
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,431
Are you okay, Larry?

319
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:42,564
I...I'm going to
have to change this burr.

320
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:13,428
( Inner voice ) Feinstone her,
Dr. Caine. Feinstone her.

321
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:22,145
I am not crazy.

322
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:25,273
I am not going to hurt her.

323
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:29,027
Jamie:
Is there anything wrong?

324
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:34,741
No, no, I'm fine.

325
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:37,035
Just cleaning the instruments.

326
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,787
Be right with you.

327
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,129
Why is it so scary
to come to the dentist?

328
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:53,843
It doesn't have to be.

329
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:58,973
All right.

330
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:03,311
I'll have you fixed up in no time.

331
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,317
Ready?

332
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,701
I did it. I did it.

333
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:21,830
I'm a dentist.

334
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:26,459
I'm the best damn
dentist there ever was.

335
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,760
Are you excited?

336
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:39,723
Excited?
Yes, I uh...I think I am.

337
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:42,684
Well the people of
Paradise thank you, Larry.

338
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:44,102
Lawrence.

339
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:45,603
Hey, hey.
Picture time.

340
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:51,609
No, I just want Larry in front of
the sign. He's the man of the hour.

341
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:54,571
Boo.

342
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,456
You know, I could fix that.

343
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:07,334
Oh, I'm used to it.

344
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:10,879
Whenever you're ready.

345
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:15,050
Jamie, let me show
you the house.

346
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,014
I haven't really
changed the structure.

347
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:23,224
I mean the layout
is pretty much the same.

348
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:33,902
This is nice.

349
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,741
You've done wonders.

350
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:47,332
I believe a harmonious environment is
essential to the dental experience.

351
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,543
This one is just perfect.

352
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:53,421
Perfect?
Oh, not quite.

353
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:58,635
I'm reserving that for the operatory
that I'm creating upstairs.

354
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,971
Coming up, watch your back.

355
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:05,600
- I can't wait to see it.
- You'll be the first.

356
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:11,189
Ah, well.
My first patient.

357
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:13,650
-You look very nice.
- See ya.

358
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:20,448
Just a small country practice.

359
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:24,077
I think
I'm going to like it here.

360
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,170
I've got a feeling he's going
to be real good for this town.

361
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:50,562
( Phone rings )

362
00:37:54,774 --> 00:37:55,817
Hello?

363
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,528
Hi, Jamie.
Are you still hard at work?

364
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:02,699
I'm about ready to quit for the night.
How's the filing coming?

365
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:07,328
At this rate I should be done
somewhere around the millennium.

366
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,914
- That bad?
- Worse.

367
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:13,960
- Anyway, I just called to say hi.
- Hi.

368
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:16,171
I'll talk to you tomorrow, huh?

369
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:17,505
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

370
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:23,261
( Loud knocking at door )

371
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,816
- Dr. Caine?
- Yes.

372
00:38:36,858 --> 00:38:39,152
Oh, am I glad to see you.

373
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:42,280
The cab jockey thought you
might be working late.

374
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:44,491
I thought I'd give it a shot.

375
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:46,993
My damn tooth is killing me.

376
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,787
Uh, come in.

377
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:54,250
You're a Hall of Famer, Doc.
A Hall of Famer.

378
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:59,089
You think when we're finished you
could give me a ride to the bus stop?

379
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,508
I've got to catch the 1O:4O to K.C.

380
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:06,221
A ride?
I'm a dentist, not a cab jockey.

381
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:10,642
You know, the motel guy said
the only dentist in town was dead.

382
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:13,228
I had to track you down.

383
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:15,563
You're kind of flying
under the radar, Doc.

384
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:20,735
( Laughing )
Kind of like Stealth Dentist.

385
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:23,321
Well sir, you found me.

386
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:26,157
I guess tonight
is my lucky night.

387
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,243
We'll see.

388
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:33,707
I'm from the left coast.
L.A., la la land.

389
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:37,836
Swimming pools,
movie stars, boob jobs.

390
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:42,465
I'm on my way to K.C. Thinking about
doing a little real estate speculating.

391
00:39:42,507 --> 00:39:45,844
You know,
my rental car broke down.

392
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:48,596
And they started
to hassle me about it.

393
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:52,434
I told them to shove it, you know.
I'll just take the bus.

394
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:59,774
Have you ever been to L.A., Doc?
Have we ever met before?

395
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:03,236
God, I swear
you look familiar.

396
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:06,990
Go ahead and
open your mouth, sir.

397
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,908
You have a bus to catch.

398
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:12,871
I, I'm terrible with names,
but I never forget a face.

399
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,502
- Ah, ah.
- Hold still.

400
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:25,216
Doc, that hurts
like a bitch.

401
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:28,219
You're not going in there dry,
are you, Doc?

402
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:31,056
I mean, I'm not anti-narcotics.

403
00:40:32,682 --> 00:40:34,851
I'll administer an anesthetic.

404
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:36,186
Good.

405
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:42,901
Hey you know, just last year,
I picked out a guy at Dodger Stadium,

406
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:47,489
two sections over. I knew this guy
from somewhere, I didn't know where.

407
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:52,827
And then it hit me.
St. Paul, 1983...

408
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:55,997
...footwear expo.
Florsheim booth.

409
00:40:57,082 --> 00:41:00,210
I went over and checked it out.
It was him. Hee hee.

410
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:03,213
I never forget a face.

411
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:08,176
Have you every been to
Dodger Stadium, Doc?

412
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:12,597
No, that's not it. But don't tell me,
don't tell me. It's coming.

413
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,849
You're definitely
Southern California.

414
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:18,186
I detest baseball.

415
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:20,188
Oh, I'm never wrong, Doc.

416
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,898
Would you please sit still?

417
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,531
( Inner voice ) Ever been to L.A., Doc?
I swear you look familiar.

418
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:33,076
I never forget a face.

419
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:37,831
Oh I'm never wrong, Doc. Never.

420
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:40,083
You're definitely
Southern California.

421
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,755
You did that on purpose.

422
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:51,386
I know you.

423
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,305
Fishbein or Feinbein.

424
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:59,102
Feinburg... the crazy dentist.

425
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:02,605
Sir, sit back down.
I cannot leave that tooth untreated.

426
00:42:04,232 --> 00:42:06,067
I took an oath.

427
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:14,159
Get out of
the doorway, nutball.

428
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,121
This crazy dentist of yours,

429
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:20,540
this Fein...stone,

430
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:27,922
Would he get
out of the doorway?

431
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:51,112
I'm sorry, man.
I've got to go.

432
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:03,792
Do you still want that ride?

433
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:08,630
No. I'm a walker.

434
00:43:55,385 --> 00:44:00,515
You just couldn't have your
toothache someplace else, could you?

435
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:27,083
Insane, deranged, demented.

436
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:31,421
Psychotic, nuts,
nutso, nutcase.

437
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:34,924
Nutball, loco.

438
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:39,137
Loony, apeshit, wacko.

439
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:44,642
Oh, I didn't want to...

440
00:44:44,684 --> 00:44:52,859
I didn't want to do it.
I tried not to. I tried not to do it.

441
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,285
Okay, okay.

442
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:05,413
I'm going to make this work.
I'm going to make this work.

443
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:07,665
I will make this work.

444
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:11,419
I am in control.
I am in control.

445
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:13,213
I am not crazy...

446
00:45:13,254 --> 00:45:16,508
I am not crazy.
I am not insane.

447
00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:18,510
I am not a monster.

448
00:45:20,303 --> 00:45:23,807
Private eye:
Hello there. It's me.

449
00:45:23,848 --> 00:45:25,600
Hey, how are you doing?

450
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:29,979
I'll bet you you'll never
guess where I'm off to next.

451
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:33,024
Paradise, Missouri.

452
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:35,902
Paradise, can you believe it?

453
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,612
See you later.

454
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:49,332
Back off, Bev.

455
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:52,252
I know, I just can't get
this image out of my head.

456
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:56,798
I keep imagining you in this canoe,
with this handsome, mysterious stranger.

457
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,467
Rushing down a raging river,
waterfalls...

458
00:45:59,509 --> 00:46:02,929
boulders, white water...and he's
the only one with a life preserver on.

459
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:04,597
You're an alarmist.

460
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:07,267
No, I prefer to
see myself as a cynic.

461
00:46:07,308 --> 00:46:09,060
And the cynic in me says...

462
00:46:09,102 --> 00:46:11,146
- Hey.
- Hey.

463
00:46:11,187 --> 00:46:13,023
Haven't seen you in a week.

464
00:46:13,064 --> 00:46:15,316
Yeah, I got a job over in Otis.
I was staying with my cousin.

465
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:17,652
- I've got to go.
- Bye.

466
00:46:19,195 --> 00:46:21,990
So I hear you rented your
cottage to the new dentist.

467
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:23,742
To Dr. Caine.

468
00:46:23,783 --> 00:46:25,410
So what do you think of him?

469
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:26,870
He's nice.

470
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:28,997
Hey, I'm scheduled to do
some work in his office.

471
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,335
He's...he's not coming
between us, is he?

472
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:35,920
No.

473
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:40,216
Oh God, Robbie, you're not going to
propose again, are you?

474
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:45,180
Jamie Devers,
will you marry me?

475
00:46:45,221 --> 00:46:47,265
No.

476
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:49,684
No? Why?

477
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:55,273
Because I...
like you too much.

478
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:06,242
No, not again.

479
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:15,669
- Enjoy your blueberry pie, sir.
- Ah, blueberry...

480
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:24,386
Got a minute, sweetheart?

481
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:27,263
I can give you a second.

482
00:47:28,723 --> 00:47:33,061
Just figured you were the type that
would help out a fellow human being.

483
00:47:34,604 --> 00:47:36,356
Give me a break.

484
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:44,280
I saw a guy in town today who
looked like an old army buddy.

485
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:46,700
Maybe you could
help me track him down.

486
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:49,953
I'm staying right at the edge of town,
in the Sleepeasy Motel.

487
00:47:56,584 --> 00:47:59,796
Hey Bev. There's a little guy at
the end of the counter,

488
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:02,424
seems real interested in Doc Caine.

489
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:05,010
Asking all sorts of questions.

490
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:08,054
Thinks he knows him from the
service or something. From L.A.

491
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:11,224
What little guy?

492
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:17,814
You'd be surprised how
people neglect their teeth.

493
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:20,900
If they were only as
diligent as you, Margaret.

494
00:48:20,942 --> 00:48:23,236
Some people never learn.

495
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:28,450
Oh, I'm sorry.

496
00:48:28,491 --> 00:48:31,119
Jeremy needs you to sign these.

497
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:33,705
Hi Jamie. I'll be done with
Margaret in just a moment.

498
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:35,248
Hey, Margaret.

499
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,503
So I...I saw you earlier.

500
00:48:40,545 --> 00:48:42,005
Where?

501
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:46,968
Oh, in town,
by the cafe, with some guy.

502
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:50,472
Robbie?

503
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:52,891
Robbie.
Is that his name?

504
00:48:52,932 --> 00:48:55,935
Robbie... Well, you didn't
tell me about Robbie, did you?

505
00:48:57,812 --> 00:49:00,023
There's nothing to tell.

506
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:02,484
( Muffled )
There's nothing to tell.

507
00:49:02,525 --> 00:49:05,070
That's not what it looked like
from where I was sitting.

508
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,741
Is he a good kisser?

509
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:13,745
Did you see the part when he
was on bended knee proposing to me?

510
00:49:15,705 --> 00:49:17,332
Proposing?

511
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:20,752
Yeah, it's a joke.
I mean, he does this every month.

512
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:23,129
He proposes every month,
it's a joke...

513
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,298
Spit, Margaret.

514
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:31,012
Robbie is one of my oldest
and dearest friends.

515
00:49:31,054 --> 00:49:33,431
I mean I've known him
since I was in third grade.

516
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:35,684
Little kids, babies...

517
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:39,604
Friends. I mean, that's all it is.
That's all it ever will be.

518
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:44,693
- Friends?
- Friends.

519
00:49:46,027 --> 00:49:47,696
Just friends?

520
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:35,071
( Hears laughing )

521
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:17,572
( Pneumatic nail gun )
Excuse me. Hello.

522
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:20,408
I'm with a patient,
could you please...?

523
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,911
Would you stop--

524
00:53:31,294 --> 00:53:33,755
Hey. Hey, hey.

525
00:53:37,759 --> 00:53:38,968
Hey.

526
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:40,553
I'm with a patient right now.

527
00:53:40,595 --> 00:53:44,474
If you could just give me
15 minutes or so.

528
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:46,476
In case you haven't
put it together,

529
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:50,397
I'm the jerk who cut you
off the other day in town and...

530
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:51,731
anyway, I'm sorry.

531
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:52,649
No problem, man.

532
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:55,276
I'm Robbie Mauro,
I'm the drywall guy.

533
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:57,445
Aren't you living
in Jamie's cottage?

534
00:53:57,487 --> 00:53:59,197
Yeah, yeah,
that's right.

535
00:54:01,282 --> 00:54:04,160
- She's...spoken of you.
- Yeah?

536
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,123
About how you've been friends
since you were children.

537
00:54:08,164 --> 00:54:10,959
I've been in love with
Jamie since the third grade.

538
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:13,211
Third grade, huh?

539
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:15,171
How about Jamie?

540
00:54:15,171 --> 00:54:18,008
Oh, she's in love with me.
She just doesn't know it.

541
00:54:18,049 --> 00:54:19,592
Oh yeah?

542
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:28,268
I'm terribly sorry...

543
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:30,979
I, I didn't know it was loaded.

544
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:40,321
( Typing - phones ringing )

545
00:54:48,872 --> 00:54:50,665
Gotcha.

546
00:54:50,707 --> 00:54:53,460
He doesn't exist.

547
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:54,878
What are you talking about?

548
00:54:54,919 --> 00:54:57,714
Larry Caine.
He has no credit history.

549
00:54:57,756 --> 00:55:00,508
I checked and re-checked.
The man is a blank.

550
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:03,678
He was somebody else
before he came to paradise.

551
00:55:05,388 --> 00:55:07,307
Bev, this is nonsense.

552
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:12,062
No, there was a guy at the cafe. Said he
was sure he knew him from Los Angeles.

553
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:13,688
Not Washington.

554
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:18,360
Larry Caine is a valued customer of
our bank and an asset to our town.

555
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:21,404
I think you've been reading too
many murder mysteries, Bev.

556
00:55:23,323 --> 00:55:26,659
Well, he could be one of those
Medicare fraud doctors,

557
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:30,330
who you see ducking behind
doors on 6O Minutes.

558
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:32,165
Thank you, Bev.

559
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:35,752
Dammit, Jeremy. He could be married,
with a wife and kids.

560
00:55:38,588 --> 00:55:40,590
Thank you, Mrs. Swales.

561
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:43,760
( Phone ringing )

562
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:45,387
Bank of Paradise.
This is Jamie.

563
00:55:45,428 --> 00:55:47,972
- Jamie. Hi.
- Hi.

564
00:55:48,014 --> 00:55:52,227
Listen, I'm standing outside
the office on the grounds here,

565
00:55:52,268 --> 00:55:54,604
and I've been thinking
about you all day.

566
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:57,440
And I was hoping you'd do me the
honor of joining me for dinner

567
00:55:57,482 --> 00:55:59,693
at the most exclusive
restaurant in town.

568
00:56:01,194 --> 00:56:03,530
No, not the Paradise Cafe.

569
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:07,534
Something much
better than that.

570
00:56:24,217 --> 00:56:26,052
- Hi
- Hi.

571
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:28,680
- You look great.
- You too.

572
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:30,598
I love my dress.

573
00:56:31,641 --> 00:56:34,310
But, how did you know my size?

574
00:56:34,352 --> 00:56:37,272
Perfect only comes in one size.

575
00:56:38,648 --> 00:56:40,400
- Where are we going?
- Shhh!

576
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:52,787
Oh Larry, I just love
what you've done out here.

577
00:56:57,292 --> 00:57:00,211
Under the stars,
in the dark of night,

578
00:57:00,253 --> 00:57:02,505
silence the woes,
and give love its flight.

579
00:57:53,014 --> 00:57:56,434
Stay...
stay right here.

580
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:00,188
Don't move.

581
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:34,723
I should put these in water.

582
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:40,270
They'll keep.

583
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:41,438
No they won't.

584
00:58:43,606 --> 00:58:47,193
I'll bring
you more tomorrow.

585
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:49,529
I want these.

586
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:53,742
( Phone ringing )
Don't answer that.

587
00:58:53,783 --> 00:58:55,910
Answer what?

588
00:58:56,953 --> 00:59:00,540
Robbie: Hey, Jamie,
I guess you're not in.

589
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:03,335
Look, my cousin Louis and his wife
are going to be in town Friday.

590
00:59:03,376 --> 00:59:06,046
I figured wouldn't it be cool,
you and me have dinner with them?

591
00:59:06,087 --> 00:59:09,299
You being my future wife
and all. It will be fun.

592
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:12,135
Oh, yeah.
This is Robbie.

593
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:15,096
Seriously, Jamie.
I'd like to see you more.

594
00:59:15,138 --> 00:59:17,432
I can't seem to get that
Thanksgiving out of my head.

595
00:59:17,474 --> 00:59:20,852
Let's go to my room, Larry.

596
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:23,021
Let me know. Bye.
( Beeps )

597
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:28,860
Your oldest, dearest, friend
is in love with you, Jamie.

598
00:59:30,528 --> 00:59:32,655
No, he's not.

599
00:59:32,697 --> 00:59:36,159
Mr. Drywall
is in love with you.

600
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:39,412
And how do you feel
about him, Jamie?

601
00:59:42,123 --> 00:59:44,876
I told you
how I feel about him.

602
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:49,506
But you didn't tell me about that
very special Thanksgiving, though,

603
00:59:49,547 --> 00:59:51,007
did you?

604
00:59:56,554 --> 00:59:59,057
I had just...

605
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:03,228
Larry, I lost both of my parents
in less than 6 months. I just...

606
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:06,147
And...and what?

607
01:00:06,189 --> 01:00:09,818
And I was invited over to a friend's
house for Thanksgiving dinner.

608
01:00:09,859 --> 01:00:12,070
Robbie was there.

609
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:14,447
I was just lonely.
Larry, it meant nothing.

610
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:19,661
Oh no, it meant something.
Believe me. It meant something.

611
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:24,082
- You don't get it.
- Oh I get it. Believe me, I get it.

612
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:28,044
Would you stop cleaning
my kitchen.

613
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,944
I'm sorry. I...

614
01:01:02,787 --> 01:01:06,791
Just can't get enough of those
blue collar types, can you?

615
01:01:19,012 --> 01:01:22,182
Goes by the name of Caine.

616
01:01:51,169 --> 01:01:54,005
ELEVEN ROSES TO SAY I'M SORRY...

617
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,091
And the twelfth one is with him.

618
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:06,893
In review of our membership...

619
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:08,895
He couldn't be Dr. Caine.

620
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:12,315
Hello.

621
01:02:39,592 --> 01:02:41,386
Doctor's office.

622
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:43,346
Who is it?

623
01:02:43,346 --> 01:02:47,058
It's Bev from the bank. She wants
an appointment for this afternoon.

624
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,729
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

625
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:53,815
It'll be fine, Bev. 4:3O?

626
01:02:58,528 --> 01:03:01,406
Any other calls?
Jamie?

627
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:03,324
No.

628
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:08,788
Desert Storm?

629
01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:12,834
The Gulf War was over in 1991.

630
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:17,005
That would make this
magazine what, Bernice?

631
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:21,301
The answer is, ''out of date.''
This is an out of date magazine.

632
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:25,096
How many times did I tell you
to get rid of all of these?

633
01:03:26,348 --> 01:03:28,516
Here, want me to help you?

634
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:36,775
I think I'd better go.

635
01:04:09,265 --> 01:04:12,143
- Where are you going?
- Fact finding mission.

636
01:04:13,186 --> 01:04:17,232
- Don't forget about tonight.
- Oh, I'll be there. With bells on.

637
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:02,610
Bernice?

638
01:05:06,156 --> 01:05:07,615
Dr. Caine?

639
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:17,542
Hello?

640
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,570
Thanks for being on time, Bev.

641
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:47,530
Oh, jezze.

642
01:05:47,572 --> 01:05:49,741
I, I wasn't snooping.

643
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:52,827
I just wanted to
look at my file.

644
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:55,205
Really. I've wanted to look at
my file since I was a kid.

645
01:05:55,246 --> 01:05:57,165
Sanderson, Emil.

646
01:05:57,207 --> 01:05:59,042
Your file is inside.

647
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,464
The first time I peeked in
my files I was in college.

648
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:13,139
Now, to more important things...

649
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:17,018
...this discolored tooth of yours.

650
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:19,854
Oh, it's been that way
since junior high.

651
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:24,025
It should have been
taken care of. Lean forward.

652
01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:30,240
Let's have a look,
shall we?

653
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:35,495
Open wide for me.
Smile, a big smile.

654
01:06:44,045 --> 01:06:47,757
As long as we're
bonding your incisor,

655
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:50,802
that's that discolored tooth,

656
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:53,555
we could do all your teeth,

657
01:06:53,596 --> 01:06:57,267
make them a few shades lighter,

658
01:06:57,308 --> 01:06:59,894
give you that Hollywood smile.

659
01:06:59,936 --> 01:07:02,731
All of them? You think?

660
01:07:02,772 --> 01:07:05,066
I'd just like them whiter

661
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:06,735
without anyone noticing
that I did anything.

662
01:07:06,776 --> 01:07:09,904
If that's possible.

663
01:07:09,946 --> 01:07:11,781
Anything is possible.

664
01:07:13,074 --> 01:07:14,200
Open.

665
01:07:15,285 --> 01:07:17,287
So...

666
01:07:17,287 --> 01:07:20,582
You ever been to
Hollywood, Larry?

667
01:07:20,623 --> 01:07:23,043
I went to
Washington D.C. once.

668
01:07:24,794 --> 01:07:26,463
I bet you miss it.

669
01:07:26,504 --> 01:07:29,591
Washington... home.

670
01:07:29,632 --> 01:07:33,887
I mean, it's exciting.
It's our nation's capital.

671
01:07:33,928 --> 01:07:36,264
Funny...

672
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:38,892
What's that, Bev?

673
01:07:38,933 --> 01:07:43,063
There was this guy, passed through
town day before yesterday.

674
01:07:43,104 --> 01:07:46,274
He said he was sure
he knew you from Los Angeles.

675
01:07:46,316 --> 01:07:49,110
But that couldn't be.

676
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:51,196
You being from D.C. and all.

677
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:55,784
No. No it couldn't.

678
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:00,580
Could it, Bev?

679
01:08:00,622 --> 01:08:04,709
He was grilling Shawna at the cafe.
A little guy, she said.

680
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:07,462
This little guy.
Does he have a name?

681
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:08,630
I don't know.

682
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:11,966
Well let's see
what you do know.

683
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:18,848
What are you doing? Hey.

684
01:08:23,978 --> 01:08:25,980
Breathe, Bev.

685
01:08:26,022 --> 01:08:27,649
Breathe.

686
01:08:34,989 --> 01:08:37,158
Breathe.

687
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,077
Yeah.

688
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:44,916
Wake up, Bev.
It's time to go to school.

689
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:47,377
Five more minutes, daddy...

690
01:08:49,879 --> 01:08:51,381
What?

691
01:08:52,924 --> 01:08:55,135
Oh my God...

692
01:08:55,176 --> 01:08:56,136
What?

693
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,640
Oh, my God.

694
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:05,437
Larry, you can't do this.

695
01:09:05,478 --> 01:09:08,023
What, bond your teeth?

696
01:09:08,064 --> 01:09:10,483
Please let me go.
Please let me go.

697
01:09:13,236 --> 01:09:15,572
This is how we bond our teeth...

698
01:09:17,157 --> 01:09:19,200
...in Hollywood, Bevie.

699
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:23,038
Bonding in bondage.

700
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:24,914
It's all the rage.

701
01:09:24,956 --> 01:09:26,916
Please don't hurt me, Larry.

702
01:09:29,377 --> 01:09:31,796
Oh sure. You come in here
under false pretenses.

703
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:35,759
Nose through my files, you sit there
asking all your wheedling questions.

704
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,345
And then you
beg me not to hurt you?

705
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:41,139
What world do you live in, Bevie?

706
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:12,337
Now the nerve's exposed,

707
01:10:12,379 --> 01:10:15,423
and we can commence
with a little game.

708
01:10:15,465 --> 01:10:18,843
A lie detector test,
if you will.

709
01:10:18,885 --> 01:10:20,929
I'll ask a question,

710
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:22,347
and you answer it.

711
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:24,641
If you tell the truth,

712
01:10:24,683 --> 01:10:27,435
I'll pat your head.

713
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:30,855
If you lie,

714
01:10:30,897 --> 01:10:32,565
I shall do this...

715
01:10:33,191 --> 01:10:34,484
( Screaming )

716
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,742
I think you get it.

717
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:44,911
Now the first question is:

718
01:10:44,953 --> 01:10:47,330
What do you know about me?

719
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:50,750
I know what everybody
else knows.

720
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:53,253
Oh Bev, wrong answer.

721
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:19,195
Now.
The question was:

722
01:11:19,237 --> 01:11:23,199
Exactly what
do you know about me?

723
01:11:23,241 --> 01:11:27,203
I know that you're not
really Dr. Lawrence Caine.

724
01:11:27,245 --> 01:11:29,205
That I'm not really
Dr. Lawrence Caine?

725
01:11:29,205 --> 01:11:32,584
I know you were somebody
else six years ago.

726
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:34,669
Good. Good.

727
01:11:36,838 --> 01:11:38,506
Now, next question:

728
01:11:38,548 --> 01:11:42,385
Why all those clumsy
questions about Washington?

729
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:45,889
I didn't think
you lived in Washington.

730
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:47,974
You didn't think
I lived in Washington?

731
01:11:50,518 --> 01:11:53,229
Good, good Bev.

732
01:11:53,271 --> 01:11:57,984
Do you know who I was
before I was Dr. Lawrence Caine?

733
01:11:58,026 --> 01:11:59,444
No.

734
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:01,905
No?

735
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,533
Wrong answer.

736
01:12:16,294 --> 01:12:18,588
( Buzzer sounds )

737
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:21,508
( Sobbing )

738
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:26,388
Help me.

739
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,686
Somebody help me.

740
01:12:36,606 --> 01:12:40,151
If you say a word,
if you utter a sound while I'm gone,

741
01:12:40,193 --> 01:12:42,821
I will cut out your
vocal cords with this.

742
01:12:42,862 --> 01:12:44,239
Do you understand?

743
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:10,473
- Robbie. What can I do for you?
- I got the last of the drywall here.

744
01:13:10,515 --> 01:13:12,308
Well, I'm with a
patient right now.

745
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:15,895
Bev? Because I noticed
her car was out there.

746
01:13:15,937 --> 01:13:18,606
Yes.
We're...bonding.

747
01:13:22,986 --> 01:13:23,820
Help.

748
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:27,490
( Bev screaming )

749
01:13:27,532 --> 01:13:29,993
The novocaine
must have worn off.

750
01:13:30,035 --> 01:13:33,413
I'm going to have to ask you to
stay outside. It's very important...

751
01:13:33,455 --> 01:13:34,706
Don't...

752
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Bev!
Robbie!

753
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:07,530
Oh, Robbie!

754
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,500
No!

755
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:51,700
Bev, Bev, Bev...

756
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:58,039
Here we were, two pals
playing a friendly little game,

757
01:14:58,081 --> 01:15:00,709
the minute I turn my back,

758
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,127
you cheat.

759
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:06,881
Get off me.
Get off me.

760
01:15:16,516 --> 01:15:19,102
New game, Bevie.

761
01:15:19,144 --> 01:15:21,730
Truth...

762
01:15:21,771 --> 01:15:23,231
...or tooth.

763
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:36,077
What did you tell Jeremy
about Washington?

764
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:38,246
I didn't tell.
I didn't tell...

765
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:56,181
Your discolored tooth was a problem.
Not a problem any more.

766
01:15:56,222 --> 01:15:59,059
I can see that you
floss regularly, Bev.

767
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,268
I like that.

768
01:16:03,688 --> 01:16:06,149
Now, Jamie.

769
01:16:06,149 --> 01:16:08,276
What did you tell Jamie?

770
01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:10,278
( Mumbling )

771
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:14,074
Yeah?
Are you sure?

772
01:16:15,742 --> 01:16:19,704
Oh, Bev. You liar.

773
01:16:30,465 --> 01:16:32,759
Damn it, I broke it.

774
01:16:37,514 --> 01:16:41,017
Darn. This is the part I hate.
I don't mind telling you, Bevie,

775
01:16:41,059 --> 01:16:43,478
pulling teeth is like, well...

776
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,021
pulling teeth.

777
01:16:48,233 --> 01:16:50,819
You're looking
much better already.

778
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:07,711
Give me back my drill.

779
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:16,720
Okay,
I've got a much better idea.

780
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:18,930
A much better idea.

781
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:20,765
Oh Bev,
you're going to love this.

782
01:17:22,434 --> 01:17:24,102
We'll cut it out.

783
01:18:41,262 --> 01:18:43,431
( Sinister laugh )

784
01:18:59,155 --> 01:19:01,116
( Woman laughing )

785
01:20:01,551 --> 01:20:03,845
( Dialing )

786
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:09,726
( Phone ringing )

787
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:14,689
Brooke...

788
01:20:16,691 --> 01:20:20,153
The doctor isn't in right now.
Please leave a message.

789
01:20:21,196 --> 01:20:24,032
It's me...

790
01:20:24,074 --> 01:20:25,200
You can speak?

791
01:20:25,241 --> 01:20:27,202
Both of us
overreacted last night.

792
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:32,665
And I'm sorry if
I said anything that hurt you,

793
01:20:32,707 --> 01:20:34,542
that wasn't my intention.

794
01:20:34,584 --> 01:20:36,878
It's too late for apologies.

795
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,713
Jamie:
I'm almost at your office.

796
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:41,841
Do you think
I wanted to do that to you?

797
01:20:41,883 --> 01:20:44,928
Jamie:
I'm coming for the twelfth rose.

798
01:20:48,348 --> 01:20:49,933
I worshiped you,

799
01:20:49,974 --> 01:20:52,519
but then I saw you...

800
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,396
with him...

801
01:20:56,022 --> 01:20:58,483
in your mouth.

802
01:20:58,525 --> 01:21:01,361
I couldn't let you
keep your tongue,

803
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:03,488
not after that.

804
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:43,838
Jamie:
Larry? Oh, my God.

805
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,300
Stop it.

806
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:48,426
Stop.

807
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:57,394
That was weird.

808
01:22:57,435 --> 01:22:59,270
Who is she?

809
01:22:59,312 --> 01:23:01,231
It gets confusing
at times, Brooke.

810
01:23:08,446 --> 01:23:11,366
I think
I should call the police.

811
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:34,889
Larry?

812
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:25,774
( Dialing )

813
01:24:25,815 --> 01:24:27,650
( Busy signal )

814
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:52,300
Larry.

815
01:24:52,342 --> 01:24:54,052
( Busy signal continues )

816
01:24:58,181 --> 01:25:00,975
Through all the drama,

817
01:25:01,017 --> 01:25:03,937
whether damned or not,

818
01:25:03,978 --> 01:25:06,356
love gilds the scene,

819
01:25:07,524 --> 01:25:10,527
and women drive the plot.

820
01:25:12,153 --> 01:25:13,530
Come here.

821
01:25:18,743 --> 01:25:20,286
Come here.

822
01:25:24,082 --> 01:25:25,625
No. Let go.

823
01:25:32,215 --> 01:25:35,093
Damn cap
just won't stay in.

824
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:38,680
Jamie. Jamie!

825
01:25:52,402 --> 01:25:54,320
Jamie.

826
01:26:12,756 --> 01:26:14,424
( Door rattles )
Let me in.

827
01:26:19,763 --> 01:26:21,181
Jamie,
are you in there?

828
01:26:22,515 --> 01:26:24,559
Jamie,
I know you're in there.

829
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

830
01:27:10,855 --> 01:27:12,399
Jamie?

831
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:16,695
Open the door,

832
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,822
just a crack.

833
01:27:18,863 --> 01:27:20,907
You stay away from me.

834
01:27:22,826 --> 01:27:25,370
- Jamie, open the door.
- No...

835
01:27:28,123 --> 01:27:30,458
All right.
Have it your way.

836
01:27:31,501 --> 01:27:33,253
( Skill saw buzzing )

837
01:27:35,672 --> 01:27:37,257
Don't you see it, Jamie?

838
01:27:37,298 --> 01:27:39,134
We're joined at the hip.

839
01:27:39,175 --> 01:27:40,969
We're Rob and Laura...

840
01:27:41,011 --> 01:27:43,096
We're peanut butter and jelly...

841
01:27:43,138 --> 01:27:44,681
We're Marge and Homer...

842
01:27:44,723 --> 01:27:46,558
We're green eggs and ham...

843
01:27:47,934 --> 01:27:49,352
We're corned beef...

844
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:51,813
and cabbage.

845
01:27:51,855 --> 01:27:53,732
No.

846
01:27:53,773 --> 01:27:55,650
Open wide, Jamie.

847
01:27:57,861 --> 01:27:58,862
No.

848
01:28:33,229 --> 01:28:35,398
( Opera music playing )
There we are.

849
01:28:43,907 --> 01:28:47,202
There we are. There we are.

850
01:28:48,244 --> 01:28:50,705
Do you have
any idea where you are?

851
01:28:54,209 --> 01:28:56,544
On the cutting edge.
That's where.

852
01:28:56,586 --> 01:29:02,926
On the threshold of a new
patient-friendly era of dentistry.

853
01:29:04,678 --> 01:29:05,970
Behold...

854
01:29:07,806 --> 01:29:10,892
...the dental environment...

855
01:29:13,103 --> 01:29:14,688
of the future.

856
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:23,655
This is an empty room.

857
01:29:23,697 --> 01:29:26,241
It is not just
an empty room.

858
01:29:26,282 --> 01:29:30,453
It is a total
dental environment.

859
01:29:33,748 --> 01:29:37,752
Bathroom accidents, the greatest
cause of injury in the home.

860
01:29:40,338 --> 01:29:43,800
Wisdom teeth?
You're here for your wisdom teeth?

861
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:49,055
I had my wisdom teeth
out years ago.

862
01:29:51,975 --> 01:29:55,770
Then we'll just have to do
a much better job this time.

863
01:29:55,812 --> 01:29:57,439
Won't we?

864
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,190
Open wide.

865
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:15,040
You get away from me.

866
01:30:45,695 --> 01:30:48,823
Jamie.
Brooke.

867
01:30:51,493 --> 01:30:53,286
Jamie.
Brooke.

868
01:31:05,423 --> 01:31:07,967
Brooke.
Oh, my Brooke.

869
01:31:38,665 --> 01:31:41,209
( Ominous laugh )
Jamie.

870
01:31:55,974 --> 01:31:59,269
I know you're behind there.
Come out.

871
01:32:09,154 --> 01:32:10,989
Whoa, Matilda.

872
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:17,495
I'm not Matilda,
and I'm not Brooke.

873
01:32:17,537 --> 01:32:19,539
Gonna let you in
on a little secret.

874
01:32:21,332 --> 01:32:24,002
Killing is liberating.

875
01:32:24,044 --> 01:32:26,671
You just might like it.

876
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:28,715
I can kill you with this.

877
01:32:29,758 --> 01:32:34,095
But what if it's not...

878
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:36,890
plugged in?

879
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,685
What if it is?

880
01:32:40,727 --> 01:32:45,106
Small town girl.
Nice, honest, small town little girl.

881
01:32:46,274 --> 01:32:48,193
You're not going
to pull the trigger.

882
01:32:49,402 --> 01:32:51,905
I'll tell you what:

883
01:32:51,946 --> 01:32:54,157
I'll give you to three.

884
01:32:55,492 --> 01:32:57,827
Then I'm going
to cut you a new smile,

885
01:32:57,869 --> 01:33:00,789
and start
to have some real fun.

886
01:33:00,830 --> 01:33:02,040
One.

887
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:05,877
Two.

888
01:33:44,582 --> 01:33:46,626
Surprise.

889
01:33:51,631 --> 01:33:52,882
They're new.

890
01:33:54,426 --> 01:33:56,428
I just bought them.

891
01:34:17,657 --> 01:34:19,034
Jamie?

892
01:34:20,326 --> 01:34:22,495
( Softly )
I'm over here.

893
01:34:22,537 --> 01:34:24,205
( Coughing )

894
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:31,171
Are you okay?

895
01:34:34,090 --> 01:34:36,051
Where is he?

896
01:34:39,846 --> 01:34:41,765
( Laughing hysterically )

897
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:11,378
That damned tooth.

898
01:35:23,014 --> 01:35:25,350
Stop. No.
Stop. No.
