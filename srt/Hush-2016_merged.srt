00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:19,135
Hi.

2
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,511
I finished your book.

3
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:24,639
I finished your book.

4
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,100
You don't have to sign.

5
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,476
I know you can read my lips,

6
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,936
but I am getting better.

7
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
Better.

8
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:32,689
- I um... I want to practise.
- Cool.

9
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,235
Taking another class with John.

10
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,486
- John?
- It's fun!

11
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:41,908
I am way better at understanding it
than actually doing it, but...

12
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,786
So, what did you think?

13
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,954
What did I... What did I think?

14
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,249
- I loved it.
- Thank you.

15
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,332
I um...

16
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,461
I loved Riley.

17
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,963
I loved Erin.

18
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,465
- Thank you.
- They were great characters.

19
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:02,552
I tried to guess the ending.

20
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:07,225
I am usually on point with that
sort of thing, but I was way off!

21
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,768
How did you do that?
How do you...?

22
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,520
How do you come up with that?

23
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,565
My mom calls it "writer brain."

24
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,775
Makes me crazy.

25
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,823
Any possible outcome
is like a movie in my head...

26
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:23,615
with many endings.

27
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,493
A frustrating movie.

28
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:30,330
Hard to make the voices quiet.

29
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,251
A voice?

30
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,377
I have a voice in my mind.

31
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,966
Does the voice sound like a kid?

32
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:43,552
You were 13 when you got sick?

33
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,556
It sounds like my mom.

34
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,855
Whatever is going on in your brain,

35
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:58,234
I think that you are a good storyteller.

36
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
What?

37
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,035
This means...

38
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,828
kisser.

39
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,957
This means storyteller.

40
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,418
Well,
I'm sure you're also a lovely kisser.

41
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,244
Jesus!

42
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,208
I'm sorry.

43
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,585
Fire alarm.

44
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,672
God! That is one hell of a fire alarm!

45
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,176
I have to feel the vibrations.

46
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,053
That is why it is so loud.

47
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:09,013
When I am sleeping,

48
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,057
the vibrations will wake me up.

49
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,100
Well, I imagine that would wake anyone.

50
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,858
Oh! Cat?

51
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,778
She is fine. Independent little bitch.

52
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:27,656
She's a... She's a what?

53
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,743
B-I-T-C-H.

54
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,704
Bitch.

55
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,872
Bitch.

56
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,798
I am sorry about dinner.

57
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:47,509
Do you want to come over?

58
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,470
We can order in and watch a movie.

59
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,597
John will be home in an hour,
so he can join.

60
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,808
Have to work.

61
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,019
I understand.

62
00:07:57,103 --> 00:07:58,103
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,482
Thank you for...
for letting me borrow this.

64
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,443
Keep it. I have got dozens upstairs.

65
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,903
Thank you.

66
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:10,740
I'll pop by tomorrow and brush up signs?

67
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,826
I'm going to get good.

68
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,910
I'm determined.

69
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,746
- Kissing.
- Kissing.

70
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,914
Storyteller.

71
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,916
Bitch.

72
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,002
Bitch.

73
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,797
<i>...clenching the book</i>

74
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,590
<i>Riley to the church.</i>

75
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,758
<i>The church to Erin.</i>

76
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,095
<i>The church to Father Paul.</i>

77
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,012
<i>Bring in Erin. Scratch that. Try this.</i>

78
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:58,182
<i>The rage bubbled up,
spreading into his head.</i>

79
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,808
<i>His ears rang. His eyes felt hot.</i>

80
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:00,725
<i>She's happy.</i>

81
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,478
<i>...mysterious ways.</i>

82
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,271
<i>Nope, not working.</i>

83
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,940
<i>Not working. Something brighter.</i>

84
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,195
<i>...looking down with her wide,
endlessly patient eyes.</i>

85
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,738
<i>They would twinkle with red,
blue and yellow light,</i>

86
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,491
<i>just as the damned Jesus fish had</i>

87
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,909
<i>when it pulled him out of the fog
and into hell.</i>

88
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:18,827
<i>That's better.</i>

89
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,037
<i>It needs something more, something better.</i>

90
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:24,958
<i>Erin dies. Can't kill Erin. That would
piss 'em off. Didn't set it up properly.</i>

91
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,419
<i>Or scrap the whole book
and find another career.</i>

92
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:28,628
<i>A better idea.</i>

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

94
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,728
Maddie!

95
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,147
Maddie, please see me!

96
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,276
Maddie, please help me!

97
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,409
Maddie!

98
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,251
No!

99
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,003
No!

100
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,465
No!

101
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,577
<i>Hey, Squish.</i>

102
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,830
Hey, Squash.

103
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,288
<i>What are you up to?</i>

104
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,707
Abandoning the novel.

105
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,125
Joining the circus.

106
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,794
<i>Going that well, huh?</i>

107
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,214
<i>Are you still stuck on the ending?</i>

108
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,884
Which one? I have seven.

109
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,804
<i>Glad I could distract you.</i>

110
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,388
Distractions abound.

111
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,266
Craig texted me.

112
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,686
<i>Talk about bad endings!
Did you talk to him?</i>

113
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,605
No, but almost.

114
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:39,857
<i>It's been a year!</i>

115
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,108
<i>Mom keeps asking
when you're getting back out there.</i>

116
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,738
I signed up for an online-dating site
for the Deaf.

117
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,321
<i>Look at you!</i>

118
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,785
No. There are four men in the whole area.

119
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,912
Do not want.

120
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,997
<i>Miss the city yet?</i>

121
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,916
Never. Too loud.

122
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,292
<i>Seriously, Maddie?</i>

123
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,043
<i>Maybe you could come back.</i>

124
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,378
<i>Live with me.</i>

125
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:04,213
<i>I worry about you.</i>

126
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,341
<i>It is not good for anyone to be alone,
Squish.</i>

127
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,929
<i>- Isolating yourself the way that you do...</i>
- Isolation happened to me.

128
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,598
I didn't pick it.

129
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:15,684
<i>Who was that?</i>

130
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,062
<i>Behind you.
I thought I saw something move.</i>

131
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,274
Probably the cat.

132
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,610
Bitch escaped earlier.

133
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:27,738
Thank you. I have to find her.

134
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:29,363
<i>I love you.</i>

135
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,447
I love you.

00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,845
Can you read my lips?

139
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,562
Can you?

140
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,574
You have seen it now, haven't you?

141
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:26,794
"Seriously, Maddie.

142
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,506
Maybe you could come back
and live with me."

143
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,590
"You know, I worry about you.

144
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,094
It's not good for anyone to be so alone,
Squish."

145
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,559
I can come in any time I want.

146
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,895
And I can get you any time I want.

147
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:47,689
But I'm not going to.

148
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:49,942
Not until it's time.

149
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,028
When you wish you are dead -

150
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,655
that's when I'll come inside.

151
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,201
Do you understand me?

152
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,457
Nod your head if you understand me.

153
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,214
Good.

154
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,010
Then we can have some fun.

155
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:21,931
Enjoy it.

Not so easy, is it?

160
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,295
Sarah?

161
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:22,849
Sarah?

162
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,159
- On the ground!
- Whoa!

163
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,037
On the ground. Drop it!

164
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,413
- It's just a phone.
- Drop it! Hands behind your head.

165
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:49,208
- Take it easy. I'm a friend.
- Hands where I can see 'em.

166
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,251
I don't want any trouble.
Just do what I say.

167
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,796
My name is John Stanley.

168
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,630
- I said, "On your knees," sir.
- OK!

169
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:56,800
I'm a neighbour,
just looking for my girlfriend.

170
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:59,426
- Show me some ID.
- It's in my wallet, OK? Take it easy.

171
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,346
- Hands where I can see 'em.
- I'm just gonna go for my wallet.

172
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,557
I'm gonna put my phone down
and reach for my wallet. Take it easy.

173
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:21,281
- You live next door?
- Yes, sir.

174
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,408
OK.

175
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:25,911
OK.

176
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,166
I am sorry to scare you.

177
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,333
There has been a...

178
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,209
Phew!

179
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,921
Jesus! Um...

180
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:37,757
- What the hell happened here?
- I don't know. Um...

181
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:39,258
I responded to a call.

182
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,302
I got here and found the place like this.
There was someone inside.

183
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:44,471
He came running past me
and knocked me cold.

184
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,599
I woke up without my phone,
my gun or my radio.

185
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:48,893
I need to call for backup.

186
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:51,311
- Do you know who lives here?
- Yeah, it's Maddie.

187
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,981
Maddie Young. She's a friend of ours.

188
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,065
Does she live alone?

189
00:53:54,149 --> 00:53:56,901
Yeah. My girlfriend comes here
all the time. I thought maybe...

190
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:57,986
What is her name?

191
00:53:58,862 --> 00:54:00,362
It's Sarah. Sarah Greene.

192
00:54:00,947 --> 00:54:03,950
OK. Sarah. I'm sorry.
Can I use your phone to call for backup?

193
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:05,659
I should have called it in already,

194
00:54:05,744 --> 00:54:08,121
but I just started this job,
and when I got here...

195
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:11,040
- Are you police?
- Deputy. Just barely, though.

196
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,753
I can call the Sheriff,
if I can just use your...?

197
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:18,965
Here you go.

198
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,257
Thanks.

199
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,101
Yeah, I got a 7-19 here at 811 Fairhope.

200
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,562
Signs of possible forced entry.
Suspect is at large on foot.

201
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:39,651
No one else here,
but a neighbour just showed up.

202
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,279
Yeah. OK.

203
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:44,573
See you soon.

204
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,493
Hey, did you see that?

205
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,875
Yeah, I did.

206
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:58,295
This girl, Maddie,
does she have a boyfriend?

207
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,631
No, I don't think so.

208
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,381
Hm.

209
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:06,221
Family nearby? Anybody else that could
possibly have access to the house?

210
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:09,431
No, she pretty much keeps to herself.

211
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,227
- Is your arm OK?
- Oh, yeah.

212
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:15,897
The guy just ploughed into me.
He hit me like a truck.

213
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:20,860
He must have been...
well, just about your size, actually.

214
00:55:20,944 --> 00:55:22,028
You know, like a jock.

215
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,238
Linebacker type.

216
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:25,197
Scary guy.

217
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:28,201
Can I get that back?

218
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:30,829
The phone.

219
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,745
Oh!

220
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,875
Yeah, of course. Sorry.

221
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:39,170
So stupid of me. Force of habit.

222
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:50,722
You said you responded to a call.
Was that from Maddie?

223
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,893
From the dispatcher... actually.

224
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:58,314
They said someone had called it in.
I just assumed it was the resident.

225
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:03,069
Yeah, because she wouldn't be able
to make that call. She's deaf and mute.

226
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:06,154
Huh.

227
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,871
Well, I guess it must have been
your girlfriend who made the call.

228
00:56:51,326 --> 00:56:52,784
So, deaf mute, huh?

229
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:54,745
Pretty rough.

230
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,831
Has she always been unable to hear?

231
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,127
No, not always.

232
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,173
Since she was a teenager, I think.
Meningitis.

233
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:16,142
Still, to live alone like this...
she must be able to get by.

234
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:17,726
I can't swear to it, but...

235
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,941
...I'm pretty sure she has a spare key
in that planter on the porch down there.

236
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:25,985
Wouldn't that be great?

237
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:27,069
Yeah.

238
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:29,613
Just...?

239
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,241
Yeah, it's right down there,
on that corner.

240
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,454
So, who do you think it was?

241
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:39,915
Like, a burglar?

242
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:42,751
- I hope it wasn't something worse.
- I am sure they are fine.

243
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,380
If they called it in,
they probably got the hell out of here.

244
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:47,881
Trashed her car pretty good, huh?

245
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:51,468
Oh, yeah. Look at that. Jeez!

246
00:57:53,972 --> 00:57:57,183
So, how long do you think it will take
for the cavalry to arrive?

247
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:58,892
About ten. Fifteen, maybe.

248
00:57:58,977 --> 00:57:59,978
Really?

249
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:04,815
I'm glad you happened across me. I could
have been out here all night, bleeding.

250
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,525
Yeah, I'm glad I came by.

251
00:58:08,987 --> 00:58:09,988
In here, you said?

252
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,531
Yeah, I think so. I'm not sure.

253
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:26,294
Easy.

254
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:28,255
Easy.

255
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,217
Hey, hey, hey!

256
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,136
Hey, come on. It is done. It is done.

257
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:35,053
It is done.

258
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

259
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:52,904
I figured I had about a two-in-ten chance
if it came to a fight.

260
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:56,533
You are just so damn big.

261
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,123
I'm actually pretty glad she showed up
when she did. Thank you.

262
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,464
Shh! It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

263
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:32,610
Run!

264
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:35,905
Run!

265
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:32,588
<i>You can't run.</i>

266
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:07,623
<i>You can't run. You can't run.</i>

267
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:09,417
<i>You can't outrun him on that leg.</i>

268
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,504
<i>- I can't outrun him on that leg.
- The crossbow has to be a perfect shot.</i>

269
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:14,963
<i>In the heart or in the brain.</i>

270
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,882
<i>Anything else is not gonna cut it.</i>

271
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:17,799
<i>Perfect shot.</i>

272
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:20,051
<i>And that's a long-distance weapon.</i>

273
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,304
<i>It's useless indoors.</i>

274
01:01:21,387 --> 01:01:24,973
<i>It's really tough up close, and you would
have to be close to land a kill shot.</i>

275
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,185
<i>He will be moving.</i>

276
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:30,229
<i>You can't even figure out how to load it.</i>

277
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,565
<i>- Go outside.
- Get the power back on.</i>

278
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:34,442
<i>Go outside. Get the power back on.</i>

279
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:36,693
<i>He could have flipped a switch
or cut the wires.</i>

280
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:40,030
<i>- Hiding.
- Hiding.</i>

281
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,325
<i>Bedroom, bathroom, loft.</i>

282
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:44,452
<i>Windows in each. All he needs is a rock.</i>

283
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:45,702
<i>All he needs is a rock.</i>

284
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:48,038
<i>The loft has no cover,
no doors to barricade.</i>

285
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:51,166
<i>Best-case scenario, he doesn't find you
and you bleed to death.</i>

286
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,793
<i>...doesn't find me and I bleed to death.</i>

287
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,464
<i>- Outside.
- Head outside.</i>

288
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:58,216
<i>- Crawl space.
- Go back outside.</i>

289
01:01:58,299 --> 01:01:59,883
<i>- Crawl space.
- The crawl space.</i>

290
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,220
<i>- I tried that once.
- He knows you tried that.</i>

291
01:02:02,303 --> 01:02:05,556
<i>There is little room to manoeuvre.
If he figures out you are there...</i>

292
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,725
<i>If he figures out I'm there...</i>

293
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,727
<i>I don't think you will last that long.</i>

294
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:15,774
<i>- I don't think I will last that long.
- You are cold, dizzy, and you're sweaty.</i>

295
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,985
<i>Your fingernails are blue.
Your vision is fading.</i>

296
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:22,155
<i>We are running out of time!</i>

297
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:27,160
<i>How long before you can't even walk,
or stand up, or see?</i>

298
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:30,248
<i>Sooner or later, he is coming in here.</i>

299
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:31,582
<i>He knows I am bleeding out.</i>

300
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:33,833
<i>Once he is in this house, it is over.</i>

301
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,629
<i>He is bigger, stronger and faster.</i>

302
01:02:38,673 --> 01:02:40,048
<i>And he has got the advantage.</i>

303
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:41,925
<i>He has the advantage.</i>

304
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,009
<i>He can hear you.</i>

305
01:02:45,471 --> 01:02:46,972
<i>I can't run.</i>

306
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:48,223
<i>I can't hide.</i>

307
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:49,517
<i>And we can't wait.</i>

308
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:52,060
<i>You go outside, you are dead.</i>

309
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,525
<i>Too many endings.</i>

310
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:00,569
<i>They are all the same.</i>

311
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,321
<i>All the same.</i>

312
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:06,950
<i>Which means there is only one ending
he won't expect.</i>

313
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:08,494
<i>Ending...</i>

314
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:11,997
<i>If you can't run, hide, or wait...</i>

315
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:15,293
<i>...what does that leave?</i>

316
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,716
Kill him.

317
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:33,018
Yeah... I never would have won that fight.

318
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:47,450
Oh, John, John, John.

319
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,328
These things will kill you.

320
01:04:10,723 --> 01:04:11,890
What do you think, John?

321
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:14,392
Hm?

322
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:18,063
Should I go in there...
and get this over with?

323
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,029
Yeah.

324
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:28,824
You're probably right.

325
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:32,077
I should wait a while longer...

326
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:35,121
...until she has lost more blood.

327
01:04:36,624 --> 01:04:38,083
I don't want to tempt a shot...

328
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,796
...in case her aim is any better
than her judgement.

329
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:47,676
Oh, hey there!

330
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,266
Hey.

331
01:04:58,604 --> 01:04:59,605
Is this your house?

332
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,567
Does your mommy live there?

333
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:05,735
Let's check.

334
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:08,863
Aww!

335
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:12,535
Welcome home, puss.

336
01:05:14,412 --> 01:05:17,832
It's OK. You're gonna see Mommy very soon.

337
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:21,419
Or, at least, she will see you...

338
01:05:24,797 --> 01:05:25,964
...nailed to the front...

339
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:43,458
I'm coming in.

340
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:18,757
You know what?

341
01:10:23,971 --> 01:10:26,305
I think that you're holding out on me.

342
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:31,103
I bet if I hit the right spot...

343
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,688
...I can make you scream.

344
01:12:18,085 --> 01:12:19,294
You fucking cunt.
