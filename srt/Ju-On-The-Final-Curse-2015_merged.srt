1
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,340
7:30, Halstead!
.

2
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,410
Nice a loser!
.

3
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,000
How many?
.

4
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,270
92 and counting.

5
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,880
Today, we should get out a bit.

6
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,210
Step nine, to compensate.

7
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,380
I can not wait.

8
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,150
Let us go.

9
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,890
Good morning.

10
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,040
Yesterday, he hit me.

11
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,670
(Laugh).

12
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,210
Nice, villain!
(Giggling).

13
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,310
Hey, pick that.

14
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,580
Hey!
Hey! .

15
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,020
Bring it on!
You're dead.

16
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,780
Okay, tough guy.

17
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,090
You too.
Thank you.

18
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,160
Where are you going.

19
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,920
I need you to sit down.

20
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,330
What are you looking for, huh?
Fuck.

21
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,270
Please let me leave this place.

22
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,800
I know this is not easy.

23
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,370
But such a step toward
reconciliation.

24
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,640
The people most hurt your
addiction.

25
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,440
This is the door to recovery.

26
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,910
Well, we have to keep working.

27
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,710
Now this is a mandatory policy for
all rehabilitation centers.

28
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,550
Each of you will participate.

29
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,220
One day you'll get to spend every
day this week.

30
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,690
So go out and make good use of your
time.

31
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,800
Remember, do not worry, all right?
.

32
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,700
Each step is a good.

33
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,140
(School bell).

34
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,710
Okay, so, I told you a proposition.

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,640
I do not think I want to hear
- I
stole them from my mother.

36
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,650
Now you have to put them.
Come on, I went through so much
trouble.

37
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,650
Ok. I do not know how -

38
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,780
How about you?
Yes, I take it.

39
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,980
So, you put it.

40
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,990
Hey, Charlotte.

41
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,920
No, hey, I do not want to talk to
you character, Kyle.

42
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,860
Charlotte, come on, I'm
- I'm still
your brother.

43
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,660
No, I do not want to talk to him.

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,730
Alright alright.

45
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,370
If it is not our distinguished
alumni.

46
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,010
If you and whatever you're selling
drugs.

47
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,550
School property is not off in the
next 30 seconds.

48
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,680
I want to call the police.

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,890
(Engine speed).

50
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,830
(Screeching tires).

51
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,720
(Monitor beeps) for all staff on the
third floor.

52
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,390
Nurse station.

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

54
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,430
Hey, Dad.

55
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,930
How are you?
.

56
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,270
What do you want?
.

57
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,130
They, they treat you okay?
.

58
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,630
(Impatiently hit) what the fuck you
want.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Your little prick?
Huh? .
(Beat glass).
I tell you, I never want to see you
again.

60
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,710
You get out of my sight.

61
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,050
Ten years, because of you.

62
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,740
You fuckin 'paint the devil.

63
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,790
You fuckin 'coward!
.

64
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,690
(Loud hit).

65
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,420
If I see you again, I fucking kill
you!
.

66
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,120
If you come back here, I fucking
kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you! .

67
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,970
Okay, let's talk about today's
adventure.

68
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,730
Kyle?
.

69
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,140
I have?
.

70
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,470
Please.

71
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,640
(Heavy sigh) I went to see my
sister.

72
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,110
Well, how to go?
Not very good.

73
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,150
Can you explain?
.

74
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,590
No.

75
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,930
Kyle he does not want to talk about
it.

76
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,690
Talking is the only way to move
forward.

77
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,130
Oh, fuck you, go forward!
Fuck this whole place! .

78
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,140
This makes no damn difference to us!
.

79
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,500
(Chair slamming).

80
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,370
Fuck, I hate Bob.

81
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,670
He was a rooster.

82
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,370
He is a fucking idiot.

83
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,750
It's make up day.

84
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,720
Very happy to see you.
I'm sorry for all the money I stole.

85
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,020
It's all fucking bullshit anyway.

86
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,520
Speaking of which.

87
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,290
Sonya.

88
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,300
Have your telephone.

89
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,740
My father had just died.

90
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,580
(Light breeze).

91
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,050
(Soft music).

92
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,220
I wish I knew.

93
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,620
We met the first minute.

94
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,190
Unpayable debts.

95
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,560
I owe you.

96
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,270
Because you refuse you will be
abused, bone.

97
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,700
You hired me to make up.

98
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,070
(Crying).

99
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,580
Shortly after 11:00 this morning, an
unidentified man.

100
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,190
Threw Mission City Dam.

101
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,660
Authorities believe he was dead
shock.

102
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,190
But the staff still dredging
reservoirs.

103
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,190
Find his body.

104
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,860
In Mission City.

105
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,490
(Music enhanced) (thunder rumbling).

106
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,370
(Bulb shattering).

107
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,180
Fuck.

108
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,380
(Flick switch).

109
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,080
(Crackling electricity).

110
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,200
(Hum).

111
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,070
(Bent on knocking) Come on!
.

112
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,270
(Hum).

113
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,910
(Knocks on the door) 7:30, Halls
Ted!
.

114
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,740
Nice a loser!
.

115
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,910
This is very strange.

116
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,680
What?
.

117
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,750
93, right?
.

118
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,010
Yes ah, it should be 93, but.

119
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,420
92.

120
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,920
Let us go.

121
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,600
Good morning.

122
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Nice, villain!
.

123
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,440
(Giggling).

124
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,950
Well, funny guy, clean it up.

125
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,140
What?
.

126
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,080
At the moment.

127
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,920
At the moment.
Damn.

128
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,680
All.

129
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,620
Do you see that?
.

130
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,490
Fuck you, Bob.
Back here.

131
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,600
Dick.

132
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,990
Hey.

133
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,330
Back here!
.

134
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,470
That's fucking weird.

135
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,490
(Buzzer treble).

136
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,290
(School bell).

137
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,430
Okay, so, I told you a proposition.

138
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,430
I do not think I want to hear this
proposition.

139
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,000
I stole them from my mother, and now
you have to put them.

140
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,730
Come on, I went through so much
trouble.

141
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,070
How do you steal?
.

142
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,970
I took it from her purse like
everything I need, okay?
.

143
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,710
I do not know how
- well, he took
it.

144
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,040
Okay, okay, I take it.

145
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,200
Well, is not it?
Ok.

146
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,720
Now, you have to put it to your lips
like you are French.

147
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,050
Ok. Ok.

148
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,090
(Giggling) You'll never get!
.

149
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,530
(Monitor beeps).

150
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,690
All the staff nurse on the third
floor of the station.

151
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,070
Pick up the damn phone.

152
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,560
What?
Pick up the damn phone.

153
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,200
(Impatiently tapping).

154
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,900
I tell you, I never want to see you
again!
.

155
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,010
Once you leave my sight!
.

156
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,700
10 years of your career!
.

157
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,250
You fucking dope fiend!
.

158
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,440
(Loud hit).

159
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,180
You fuckin 'coward!
.

160
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,150
I see you again, I fucking kill you!
.

161
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,120
If you come back here, I fucking
kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you! .

162
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,120
Alright alright.

163
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,420
If it is not our distinguished
alumni.

164
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,360
If you and any medications you sell.

165
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,900
School property is not off in the
next 30 seconds.

166
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,230
I called the police.

167
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,240
(Engine starting).

168
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,220
(Ringing security buzzer).

169
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,630
Okay, let's talk about today's
adventure.

170
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,840
Kyle?
.

171
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,580
Is it?
.

172
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,050
What have you done it?
.

173
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,020
Uh.

174
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,710
I went to see my sister.

175
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,410
(Laughs).

176
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,890
How for you to go?
.

177
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,320
(Laughs).

178
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,600
Can you explain, please?
.

179
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,100
No.

180
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,740
Halstead.
Halstead.

181
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,770
Kyle.

182
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,000
(Singing echoed dreamily): Kyle.

183
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,150
How the fuck are you going?
.

184
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,030
I, I moved the TV.

185
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,360
I got this shock.

186
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,800
This is the last thing I remember.

187
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,470
The same thing happens I use my
light.

188
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,040
Week?
Who cares how it happened? .

189
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,810
The real question is, then how do we
do it?
.

190
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,450
What are you doing last night?
.

191
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,250
What are u doing?
I was in the shower, okay? .

192
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,890
I was shocked, too.

193
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,920
And then?
.

194
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,390
I did not remember.

195
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,650
I do not have either.

196
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,730
The same thing happens to all of us.

197
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,230
Fuck, I'm gonna get the call again.

198
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,990
(Open).

199
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,990
Exactly the same.

200
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,270
Are you OK?
.

201
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,040
Should we do it?
.

202
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,980
We just went through the two on the
same day.

203
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,250
We just want to sit here and waste
it?
.

204
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,460
Last night, in the news.

205
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,120
There's a jumper at the dam.

206
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,970
Let us go.

207
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,430
Let us do this.

208
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,930
Damn, we have to stop him.
No, this is. It was too late.

209
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,010
(Sonia sighed.
).

210
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,270
(Thunder rumbling).

211
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,710
Can not sleep.

212
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
I do not have either.

213
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,720
At least, you go to see him.

214
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,320
I do not have.

215
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,560
I want you to go to the hospital.

216
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,570
I went to the hospital, but.

217
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,250
I just can not enter his room.

218
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,110
How you think'd happen if we just.

219
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,750
Night stay here?
.

220
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,190
The trouble is in the affirmative.

221
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,660
Then, I will not leave.

222
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,090
(Laughing).

223
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,270
Why do you think this is happening
to us right?
.

224
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,950
Sorry.
No, this is. It does not matter.

225
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,700
7:30, Halls Ted!
.

226
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,100
Bob!
.

227
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,430
What?
.

228
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,200
What day is today?
.

229
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,470
Last time I checked, this is
Wednesday.

230
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,710
You see, we came up with this.

231
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,310
We do not find the dog feces, okay?
.

232
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,180
We want to repeat again and again
the same day.

233
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,720
Until we complete our fucking minds
go.

234
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,150
Well, but, you see, we all have the
same shock power.

235
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,520
Or something, right?
So.

236
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,890
So, what is it?
So maybe this is what we do? .

237
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,290
Well, you go and get an electric
shock themselves, then, my sister.

238
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,930
But I'm going to enjoy it, and I got
it.

239
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,000
(Quietly): God, what is that girl's
problem?
.

240
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,280
You know, if you think about it, it
really does not matter what we do
today.

241
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,350
Right?
I mean, I can take a piss group.

242
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,680
Due to the fact that I could just
piss Bob.

243
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,220
Tomorrow, it will be like it never
happened.

244
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,550
Ok. I do not know, man.

245
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,030
I. . Just think we do not mess with
it, you know?
.

246
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,030
How do you think we should do
something with it?
.

247
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,600
I do not know.

248
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,090
(Laughs).

249
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,980
Pull it out and put it back.

250
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,120
(Laughs): What?
A bottle of gin.

251
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,520
I can see it in your pants.

252
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,920
Pull it out and put it back!
This is not my pants.

253
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,650
What is your name?
Put it back!
You know, you two.

254
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,300
Get out of my store!
.

255
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,260
Whether you, get out!
Moron! .

256
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,900
(Laughs).

257
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,100
Feel better?
Oh, begins.

258
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,000
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing? .

259
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,410
Oh, no, man.

260
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,610
We better pray repeat tomorrow.

261
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,180
(Engine roaring life) (laughs).

262
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,680
Fuck!
.

263
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,460
(Pertussis excited).

264
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,350
(Laughs).

265
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,890
(Tires screech).

266
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,190
You are sick!
Ill! .

267
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,350
Oh, Bobby.

268
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,230
Wow, Bob likes cats.

269
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,240
Who am I?
Who am I? .

270
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,740
(Hum).

271
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,760
Bob.

272
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,790
Love.

273
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,980
Cock old lady.

274
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,350
(Laughs).

275
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,620
What the fuck?
.

276
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,820
Oh, no.

277
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,720
Almost laws.
Almost laws. Fuck, you see.

278
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,270
(Laughs) Oh, fuck.

279
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
All right, freeze, kids!
Party.
Hands over your head.
Let's go, right now.
Hands over your head.
That's it.

280
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,970
It looks like you messed up solemn
eh, this time, weeks, right?
.

281
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,710
Like the old man, is not it?
.

282
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,280
Hands behind.

283
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,680
(Laughs).

284
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,230
Halstead.

285
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Your mother posted bail.
You see this morning.

286
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,710
Ah.

287
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,410
Looks like your father did not come,
cowboy.

288
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,770
Breaking and entering?
Vandalism? .

289
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,100
Your first day of pain that you do
with it, right?
.

290
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,710
Ah, you have to really proud of
yourself.

291
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,010
You have any idea that little
movement just took me?
.

292
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,750
Kyle.

293
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,630
Shortly after 11:00 this morning, an
unidentified man threw himself.

294
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,100
Close Mission City Dam -

295
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,940
(Heavy sigh).

296
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,700
This is very strange.

297
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,760
I was scared.

298
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,800
But.

299
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,300
At the same time, I think really
still alive.

300
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,640
If it does not repeat it?
.

301
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,380
You're going to have a top criminal
record of drug history.

302
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,820
It's quite scary, Halstead.

303
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,000
(Knocks on the door) 7:30, Halls
Ted!
.

304
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,060
Hey, Bob?
.

305
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,570
Bob.

306
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,800
I had heard.

307
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,840
Some broke into the house in the
vicinity of it?
.

308
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,710
What are you talking about in the
end?
.

309
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,510
Nothing.
Well, come on, let's go.

310
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,510
Get your ass in gear.

311
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,630
Hello there.
Ah hello.

312
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,690
(Laughing).

313
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,090
Once again.
Every time.

314
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,200
Let us go.

315
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,230
Bob, looking smooth.

316
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,400
(Clumsy): Good morning.
(Laughs).

317
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,410
(Quietly): Nice, villain.

318
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,010
(Sound pallet).

319
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,120
(Laughs).

320
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,550
So, what is the procedure?
.

321
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,250
Clean it up.
At the moment.

322
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,520
You know.

323
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,090
I think our people, Bob, on his
downtime.

324
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,960
He likes to just solve a little
Victorian gin.

325
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,390
Victoria gin?
.

326
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,090
Yes ah, yes ah, a little before
lubricating, he kicked off his
shoes.

327
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,240
He thumbs through his favorite
magazine.

328
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,240
(Chanting together): Almost the law!
.

329
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,430
Yes, Bob?
(Laughs).

330
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,170
I know he was a pig.
Oh, do not worry, Logan.

331
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,980
I think you're a little too old for
him.
Fuck you.

332
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,520
(Laughs).

333
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,950
Well, fuck, cowpokes tourism, let us
celebrate!
.

334
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,420
Ok.

335
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,620
(Country music).

336
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,000
(Scream) Yeah!
.

337
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,900
Three!
.

338
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,970
Here!
.

339
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,670
Baby, baby, baby, baby.

340
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,510
Woo!
You want to be able to.

341
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,050
Pay all this?
Oh, you bet your sweet ass, girl.

342
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,650
Well, yes, I'll need you to solve.

343
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,840
I apologize to you.

344
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,420
He has not been laid in a bit.

345
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,320
A very long time.
You have to help me with that?
.

346
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,420
Oh.

347
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,580
Sorry Sorry.

348
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,620
How can men and women will be for me
to pay.

349
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,760
I do not have money.

350
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,360
Fuck's sake.

351
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,960
I'm very sorry!
.

352
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,690
Well, thank you, partner, this is
great!
.

353
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,800
Well, ah, I'll sing a little song.

354
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,400
To pay for some drinks.

355
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,560
Woo!
.

356
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,730
Yes ah, that's right, folks!
I know that I will dedicate it.

357
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,930
Two of my friends.
You all know who you are.

00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,880
Woo!
.

540
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,950
I saw a smile!
Stop! .

541
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,150
(Laughs).

542
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,760
I will not say another word of -

543
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,020
(Screaming) No!
.

544
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,500
Do not let go!
Week! Zhou, help me! .

545
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,660
(Laughs) No!
.

546
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,240
(Screaming).

547
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,770
(Laughs).

548
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,350
You fuckin 'dead!
.

549
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,710
(Laughs) fuck you dead, you fuck!
.

550
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,150
Fuck you!

See you this morning!
.

552
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,550
Fuck you!
.

553
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,620
(Laughs) You fucking dead!
.

554
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,630
(Knocks on the door) 7:30, Ted
Halls.

555
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,920
(Chatter and laughter).

556
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,260
You should get some hash browns
before they are gone.

557
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,640
(Tray crashing) Nice a loser!
.

558
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,400
I never realized how much I love the
hashbrowns.

559
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,770
Jesus.

560
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,000
Ok.

561
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,380
It took only three days rise again
from the dead.

562
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,850
Good morning.

563
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,020
(Sound pallet).

564
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,830
Well, you died last night.
I see you dead.

565
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,200
What is it?
You What else remember? .

566
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,870
I remember before then.

567
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,710
It is empty.

568
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,060
You know, I think about suicide,
but.

569
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,430
I mean, just before that moment, the
right things happen.

570
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,570
I. .

571
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,200
I can not believe how bad I wanted
to live.

572
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,200
We have to stop.
At the moment. What?
.

573
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,240
If today is not repeated
- but it
did not repeat.

574
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,810
It looks like he was going to
repeat.

575
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,080
Yes ah, we are tempting fate w-.

576
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,340
We just want to spit something,
okay?
.

577
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,110
We want to get out of this somehow.

578
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,260
You fucking kidding me up.
This is a fucking gift.

579
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,760
We want, we can do anything,
anything.

580
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,170
This is your fucking losses.

581
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,750
Do not you think this is a weird.

582
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,120
All this stuff happened on the same
day, your father is dead?
.

583
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I forced myself to my dad.
And a first, i-i do not know how to
do.

584
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,010
I mean, I.

585
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,520
I do not even know what he was
doing.

586
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,590
I'm older.

587
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,820
I will fight back, but.

588
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,200
It never seems to stop it.

589
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,170
So, I mean, I, I do not know what.

590
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:44,500
What, I should give him some peace
of mind is what?
.

591
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Here we go.
No! No, no, no! .

592
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,590
Do not!
Do not! No! .

593
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,130
Fuck!
No! .

594
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,230
You do not want to do this!
Who are you?
.

595
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,060
You do not want to do that.

596
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,220
Look at me.
Let me go!
.

597
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,230
You do not want to do that.

598
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,390
Please let me go, let me go.

599
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,870
(Sobbing): Please.

600
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,380
It does not matter (sobbing): Please
let me go.

601
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,880
News said it was a man, but.

602
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,920
This is a girl.
Just a girl.

603
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,220
I know that she is like, my age the
same.

604
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,960
Maybe this is what we should do.

605
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:35,600
You know, maybe we should help
others.

606
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,240
She continues to be there again
tomorrow.

607
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,770
He caught me, I tried, I said stop,
he would not, a.

608
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,680
Well, we'll get you a jacket.

609
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,710
Copy.
We will give her assessment.

610
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,780
Obtain all necessary tests.

611
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,720
This is how it happened?
.

612
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,750
A girl was attacked.

613
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:00,460
(Sobbing).

614
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:03,150
I need a description.
I do not know what he looks like!
.

615
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,520
You know who did it to you?
.

616
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,790
Do not touch me!
Can you give me a description of it?
.

617
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,790
That's him.

618
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:09,960
What?
.

619
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,800
This is him!
.

620
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:13,200
Hey, hey!
Just let me go.

621
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:14,430
Do not touch me, okay?
.

622
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,220
Matter in the end is what Kyle with
you, is not it?
.

623
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:29,320
Kyle!
.

624
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,260
Stop!
.

625
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,620
Stop!
.

626
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,390
What the fuck?
.

627
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,000
You raped her!
You fucking raped her! .

628
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,330
I do not know what the fuck you're
talking about!
.

629
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,700
Do not fucking lie to me!
.

630
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:47,960
You raped a 15-year-old girl!
.

631
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,000
Well, first of all, she is 16 years
old, I'm sure she is to it.

632
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,040
You fucking raped her!
.

633
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,480
Tomorrow, he will be like it never
happened, Kyle!
.

634
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,980
It does not make better.

635
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,360
So, what is holding the liquor
store, is not it?
.

636
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:08,990
Okay?
.

637
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,890
What about kidnapping dealers.

638
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,500
Stick a gun in his face, let him eat
cow shit it?
.

639
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:18,160
You are so close to blowing his damn
mind, Kyle!
.

640
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,530
Now you have some fucking guilt
trip.

641
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,500
You want to tell me how I can act?
.

642
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,400
I do not know why this is
happening.

643
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,550
However, because it is, I want to
use it, okay?
.

644
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,020
You two better stay the fuck my way.

645
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,370
(Screeching tires).

646
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,230
That is why it happened to us?
.

647
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,850
(Knocks on the door) 7:30, Halls
Ted!
.

648
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,590
Bob!
.

649
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,420
What do you want, Halstead?
.

650
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,460
It was Wednesday, is not it?
.

651
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,690
Last time I checked, yes.

652
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,110
(Sound of chair legs).

653
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,360
Nice a loser!
.

654
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,630
I can not believe that Charlotte
hang out with Quantico.

655
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:34,640
No, I.

656
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,000
I just never thought that she is
what she is?
.

657
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,210
Like you?
.

658
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,640
I do not know.

659
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,680
(School bell).

660
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:51,320
Okay, so, I told you a proposition.

661
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,650
I do not think I want to hear.

662
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,420
This proposition.
I stole them from my mother.

663
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,920
Now you have to put them.
Come on, I went through so much
trouble.

664
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,490
How do you steal?
.

665
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,390
I took them from her purse like I
take everything.

666
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,330
Hey, Charlotte.

667
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,160
Hey, uh.

668
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,430
You see, you think, uh
- But, ah.

669
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,130
I do not want to talk to you.

670
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:12,540
Charlotte!
.

671
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:13,840
Hey.

672
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,380
Hi. My name is Sonia.

673
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:16,670
Ah.

674
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,620
You see, I know you think your
brother is a jerk.

675
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,020
But, if you want to just let him
talk to you a minute.

676
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,420
You would do me a favor, will you?
.

677
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,320
Because I was too tired to hear him
bitch.

678
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,290
How poor, he has been to you.

679
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,360
How you'll never forgive him.

680
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:43,000
Look, we are going to get some
Chinese food.

681
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,230
Why do not you come?
.

682
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Ok.
Ok.
We can meet in the truck, right?
.

683
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,080
Er, yes ah.
Ok.

684
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,720
Come in.

685
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,660
What Colour?
.

686
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:10,990
Blonde.

687
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,500
Are you going blond?
Ok.

688
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,970
Article
- I do not know.

689
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,300
I mean, I like blonde, but your
hair.

690
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,170
I mean, your eyes so well.
This is quite.

691
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,610
Yes ah, we have bought a package,
and we're doing this weekend, so.

692
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,010
It should be fun.

693
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,240
(Door bells jingling).

694
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,710
Oh, ho, ho!
Good, good, good.

695
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,480
If this is just too cute not prime
time.

696
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:32,980
You girls want to get more fucked.

697
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,090
I have been smaller than your life
in your squeaky?
.

698
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,590
Put it aside and weeks.

699
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,730
What, it does not matter, you smoke
meth, but it limits.

700
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,160
The rest of the family, is not it?
.

701
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,100
If it is not the good-neighborly and
friendly guy!
.

702
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,100
Besides, weeks.

703
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,880
How they make like you a gutless
Cuozi.

704
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,180
Become a cop anyway?
.

705
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,940
Just keep talking.
Come on, week, continue talking.

706
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,450
Well, you know, this is not even
remotely funny.

707
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,590
You see, you want to think of what
you are now doing.

708
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,730
Oh, I think, I think.
All my thunk.

709
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,950
Mike
- Shut up, Kyle.

710
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,330
I'm going to give you three seconds.

711
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,470
Let your ugly fat ass out of here.

712
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:19,300
A.

713
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,460
Pistol, Gerald.

714
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,970
Pushed from the gun hand.
You go there, you go there.

715
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,110
Two (door bells jingling).

716
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,570
(Gunfire).

717
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:26,640
(People screaming).

718
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,240
Fucking mess with me!
.

719
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,470
Yes ah, no father come to you!
.

720
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:35,480
Fuck!
.

721
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:40,480
You do not know what you're missing.

722
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,100
You okay?
.

723
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:57,170
Hey
- Are you okay?
.

724
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,510
Charlotte, are you okay?
.

725
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,500
Are you OK?
Are you ok? .

726
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:09,710
(Sob sob shock people).

727
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,190
(Knocks on the door) 7:30, Halls
Ted!
.

728
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,490
What the fuck are you doing?
.

729
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:32,000
Hey, you're doing everything.

730
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,190
It is to leave you!
It will remain in all of us! .

731
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:35,400
Kyle!
.

732
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,770
You do not want to do, Kyle!
.

733
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,600
(Muffled cries).

734
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,000
(Garbled): Kyle!
.

735
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,280
(Screaming in frustration).

736
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,300
You have to do this.

737
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:09,970
It does not make any difference.

738
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,970
Nothing.

739
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You must try.

740
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,520
You know, it's amazing.

741
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:04,020
This is something I just can not
justify the score, you know?
.

742
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,030
Yes, I would like to take this from
my mother, she'll never know it's
gone, or.

743
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,210
Steal my sister atm card.

744
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,370
Siphon off some cash here and there.

745
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,870
What a child needs all the money,
right?
.

746
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,760
Then, they.

747
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,590
They destroyed my house.

748
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,390
Because I owe money.

749
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:44,730
And.

750
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:50,100
Beat my little sister dog feces.

751
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,240
Five feet away, and I am.

752
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,910
Fuck blow my mind.

753
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,760
I can not let anyone touch me the
longest time.

754
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,800
Come on, Mike Have you ever had to
eat or drink all day.

755
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,470
Sonia and I worry about your man.

756
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,910
Oh, you is not it?
.

757
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,140
You two, thoughtful couple.
How good.

758
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,480
God, she finally got you, huh?
.

759
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,980
She fed you line.
What is it?
.

760
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:12,490
Uh. I can not let anyone touch me
the longest time?
.

761
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,450
Before that, she grabbed your cock,
it is correct?
.

762
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:16,490
How she do?
.

763
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:18,930
You know, I is not no impression,
myself.

764
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,660
The biggest challenge is to find a
nice place, where the fuck.

765
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:23,820
Do you do from here?
.

766
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,600
You did not do it, is not it?
.

767
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:27,900
What happened, man?
!
.

768
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:29,370
Look!
.

769
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,670
Mike!
.

770
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,240
Just.
Stop, will you?
.

771
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:35,000
Stop.

772
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:41,410
Just let us forget this, okay?
Let's forget all this dog feces.

773
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:45,180
Just try again.
Let's try to find that.

774
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,690
There is some deeper meaning.

775
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:52,200
Here.

776
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,390
(Laughs).

777
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:58,060
I. .

778
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,200
I just put my pants pee.

779
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:04,240
There are some deeper meaning that.

780
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:05,710
Do not you think?
.

781
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,400
(Laughs).

782
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,210
See, look for?
.

783
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,140
(Laughs).

784
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,220
I'll see you this morning!
.

785
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,480
You still drunk?
Maybe.

786
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:52,680
(Girls giggle).

787
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,860
You should not be locked in place?
.

788
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:02,930
Charlotte, I need to talk to you.

789
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:06,940
I do not want to talk to you.
Charlotte.

790
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fuck off.

791
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,280
I was just wondering if I could talk
to her.

792
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:24,620
If I can explain.

793
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,990
Maybe just no point in me trying to
explain what I do dog feces.

794
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,360
Kyle, she will come back to you.

795
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:36,120
I do not know.

796
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,310
You, uh.

797
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,970

00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:55,320
I am very okay.

800
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:35,020
Is not that part of you do not know
maybe he was right?
.

801
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:41,700
I mean, if we do every good thing
erased.

802
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,370
We were erased every bad thing.

803
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:51,370
What's really important, what do we
do?
.

804
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:58,380
I guess.

805
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:03,880
I just need for him it does not
matter.

806
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,190

808
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,790
Hey.

01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:29,240
(Sob fear).

813
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:31,310
Remove the club.

814
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,470
Come on, Kyle, this is a fucking
club.
Give it up.

815
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:38,470
You think you can decide how I spend
my repeat?
.

816
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,480
It is only fair that I return the
favor.

817
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:44,980
Take the knife.

818
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,450
(Crying).

819
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,680
Knife on the table, put it.

820
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,220
What?
.

821
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:51,490
Come on, Kyle.

822
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,660
Great.

823
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:58,360
Standing there.

824
01:01:58,540 --> 01:01:59,520
Mike, what.

825
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:05,600
Now.

826
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:07,940
Cut his throat.

827
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:10,510
(Sobbing and crying).

828
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,410
Mike, please do not.
Cut his throat.

829
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:14,170
I will a bullet in her lap.

830
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,320
I do not lie to you, Kyle.
I will a hole, her legs.

831
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:24,120
Fuck grapefruit size.

832
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:26,890
(Gunshot) (screaming).

833
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,160
To do this, or I'll put her mind

.

834
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,390
You fucked!
.

835

That's right, get angry!

Welcome to the club, Kyle.

841

All rights.

846
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,510
We will be very happy I'm fine.

847
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,480
Come on, what's wrong?
Come.

848

Fuck you.

854
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:06,690
(Gunshot, screaming girls).

855
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,210
Voice echoed: see you this morning,
Kyle.

856
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,830
(Knocks on the door) 7:30, Halls
Ted!
.

857
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:05,070
(Panting terror).

858
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:29,970
You want me to come?
.

859
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:31,370
No.

860
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:32,770
I'm fine.

861
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,820
Tonight you will die.

862
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,560
Do not ask me how I know, but it is
true.

863
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,840
I thought about what I wanted to say
to you so many times.

864
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,980
I do not hate you.

865
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:54,520
I do not know, but I have to move
from this.

866
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:59,860
I have nothing else to change.

867
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:05,200
For any of us.

868
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
(Doorbell rings).

869
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:03,830
What do you want?
.

870
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:05,120
Trouble?
.

871
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,560
No, I.

872
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:08,320
They let us out for a few hours.

873
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,760
Can I, can I come in?
.

874
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:11,960
I really need to talk to Charlotte.

875
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,330
I, I really do not think this is a
good idea.

876
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,270
Mom, I really need to talk to her.

877
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:19,930
You clean?
.

878
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,140
Yes ah, my mother.

879
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:25,040
Please let me talk to her.

880
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:29,620
Ok.

881
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:41,160
Residents reeling tonight.

882
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:42,760
Death two local police.

883
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:44,230
In what is shaping.

884
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,890
Double homicide.
The suspect was described.

885
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:49,730
As a white male in his early 20s.

886
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:54,680
Charlotte?
.

887
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:12,430
What are you doing here?
.

888
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,060
I need to talk to you.

889
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:17,390
Get out of my room.
No.

890
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:20,800
Charlotte, no, I'm not going
anywhere until you and I have talked
about, okay?
.

891
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:23,000
We have nothing to talk about the.

892
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:45,820
Whose car?
.

893
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,690
Your addict friend?
.

894
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,790
Her name is Sonia.

895
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:55,770
Yes ah, I met her recovery.

896
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:59,530
I've been thinking a lot lately.

897
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,170
Just.

898
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:05,580
About what I've done to you and
mother.

899
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:07,080
I do not want to hear this news,
Kyle.

900
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,980
I can not let another day pass
without telling you.

901
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:13,720
I do not tell you how sorry I am.

902
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:15,220
Fine.
Now we?
.

903
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,960
The thing is.

904
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:22,930
Charlotte, I see you go down the
same path, I did not.

905
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,930
You think I like you fuck?
.

906
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,400
Article No, it's not what I mean.

907
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:32,730
You do not have to watch me.

908
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,470
But I.

909
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,080
I did it.

910
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:39,610
Charlotte.

911
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:41,680
Charlotte, I do, because this is
what big brothers do.

912
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:43,320
Their little sisters.

913
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:49,090
I know you may not care now, but.

914
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:55,830
However, from now on, I will be
there waiting for you.

915
01:11:58,130 --> 01:12:00,730
I'll be there for you when the
number.

916
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,130
Because.

917
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:04,870
I love you.

918
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,100
And.

919
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:11,640
I'll be your big brother.

920
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:25,130
(Knocks on the door) 7:30, Halls
Ted!
.

921
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:27,820

Kyle?
.

923
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:33,460
To give him.

Great.
(Sob).

925
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,290
Now, I can meet you all day, Kyle.

926
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:43,460
Lets you indulge in your urine.

927
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,200
But this is not very interesting.

928
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:50,210
So we have to do is to play a little
game of hide and seek.

929
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:53,040
With a twist.

930
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,210
If I find you.

931
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,910
I want to spend my life hurt your
day.

932
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,890
(Crying).

933
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,890
(Whispering): You have one minute?
.

934
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:12,000

Are you having fun yet?
.

957
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:19,420
(Gun cocking) You know, the last
place I went to the rehabilitation
of.

958
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,190
They move from the terrible events
of our past.

959
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,460
I can play my father!
.

960
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:31,740
Or, maybe Kyle can play father
because he can not stop you fuck!
.

961
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,940
What the fuck are you doing?
(Gunshot, men groan).

Hey, are you okay?
(Gunshot, men groan).

972
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:38,270
No snow.

973

How are you?

978
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,900
I'm fine.
I just got a tetanus shot.

979
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:36,830
Some needles.

980
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,360
Where is he?

981
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,360
No one has seen him.

982
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:47,510

You fucking head down on the floor!
.

985
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:03,890
If the two of you fucking move.

986

I'll be the fucking bullet in your
head, you hear me?

Mom?

990
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:17,470
I am sorry.

991
01:19:18,810 --> 01:19:21,210
Lieutenant, this is Kyle Halstead
and Sonia Logan.

Ok.

994
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,770
The most important is that you let
him calm.

01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:31,890
(Speed Dial).

996
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,150

You think that day was, I repeat,
please?
.

1004
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:59,570
You think you have a clean slate.

1005
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:02,450
You do not know.

1006
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:05,280
Do you think the jury to go fuck

So we can solve it together.

1012

You opened my people.

1013
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,030
You should have let go.

1014
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:29,080
You should let it run its course.
You should have had my back, Kyle!
.

01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,270
Mike.

1016
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:32,940

People do not do.

Well, we went to go inside.

No, no, let me try again, I can -

1024
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:01,440
Listen, this guy killed two people.

1025

Follow me.
Hey, hey, hey!

This is my sister.

This is my little sister I will not
let you hurt her, okay?

To keep you where you are.

1043

(Crying).

1049
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:20,050
I'm never gonna make up my old man.

1050
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:22,190
I never, I never will.

1051

It does not matter how many days
repeat!
.

1052
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,900
That's the difference between me and
you, right?

Hush, Hush.

1056
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,740
It does not matter, it does not
matter.

1069
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:57,150
Set our lives.

1070
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:06,320
Where the door.

1071
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:10,660
Is groaning all day long.

1072
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:20,670
Leaning stairs.

1073
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,670
From Dusk Till Dawn.

1074
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:29,880
Where windows.

1075
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:33,850
In light breathing.

1076
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:41,160
Room.

1077
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:45,060
Set our lives.

1078
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:49,040
(Siren wailing).

1079
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:55,340
This is a place.

1080
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:59,210
I do not feel lonely.

1081
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:06,220
This is a place.

1082
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,550
I call my home.

1083
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:21,760
(Knocks on the door).

1084
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:24,910
Get up, weeks.
In another day in paradise.

1085
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,450
At breakneck speed.

1086
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,020
Occupy your hands.

1087
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:46,920
Because you landed on your feet.

1088
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:52,270
You know what I mean.

1089
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,940
Vowel change.

1090
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:08,950
I remember when our voices sound the
same.

1091
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:14,950
Now we just translate.

1092
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:24,000
Because I'm still surprised you out
alive.

1093
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:25,960
What did you do after.

1094
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:33,340
Born at your feet run.

1095
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:36,810
Under your bed forest fires.

1096
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:44,210
But it is a good back.

1097
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:48,320
Good come back good back.

1098
01:26:58,470 --> 01:27:00,590
Spell it out.

1099
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,030
I always skip the word.

1100
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:10,670
Because all pictures are so bright
and loud.

1101
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:15,810
Now better off than.

1102
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,890
Because I'm still surprised you out
alive.

1103
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:27,030
What did you do after.

1104
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:34,370
Born at your feet run.

1105
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:37,940
Under your bed forest fires.

1106
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:45,140
Because this is a very good back.

1107
01:27:45,310 --> 01:27:47,540
Good come back.

1108
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,210
Super fun.

1109
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:54,250
In drunk, young film.

1110
01:27:56,260 --> 01:28:00,060
Double knot to undo.

1111
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:05,560
But the bad years are gone.

1112
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:10,330
Yeah big bad completed.

1113
01:28:10,510 --> 01:28:12,370
And disappear.

1114
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:23,080
I remember when our voices sounded
exactly.

1115
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:27,950
Now we just translate.

1116
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:36,960
Because I'm still surprised you out
alive.

1117
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:39,260
What did you do after.

1118
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:46,370
Born at your feet run.

1119
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:50,100
Under your bed forest fires.

1120
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:57,210
But it is a good back.

1121
01:28:57,390 --> 01:29:01,620
Good come back.
