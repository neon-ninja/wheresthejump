My mother used to tell me a story.

372
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:10,916
In our village, there was once
an honorable but poor man

373
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,958
who wanted a home of his own.

374
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:19,958
He wanted it so badly,
he began to steal from others.

375
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,083
One day...

376
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:28,041
he stole from an old man
who lived by the river.

377
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:35,375
He didn't know that this man was an <i>apeth.</i>

378
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:39,791
A night witch.

379
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:45,958
And so the thief could not know
that when he built his home...

380
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:50,583
the <i>apeth,</i> too, would live there.

381
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:56,041
So, before long,

382
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:01,041
the walls would whisper
the spells of the <i>apeth.</i>

383

From the shadows...

384
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,000

385
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:13,250

386

The house.

[Mark] The house.

Oh. Okay.

- [Bol] Yes?
- Uh...

592
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,333
Sure, yeah, we can look into that for you.

593
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:14,833
But first, you have to tell me why.

594
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,041
I mean, can you name me
one of the problems?

595
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:25,000
There are... vermin.

596
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:28,166
Rats and bugs.

597
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,208
They are making us sick.

598
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,625
Rial is very ill.

599
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:34,375
Has she seen a doctor?

600
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:35,291
- Yes.
- Good.

601
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:36,875
He says...

602
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:39,458
"Get out of the house."

603
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:40,958
We have to move.

604
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,041
Where?

605
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:44,666
[Adam] His house is bigger than mine.

606
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,375

Uh...

608
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:56,166
Look, mate, this is...

609
00:51:57,083 --> 00:51:59,875
this is gonna raise
a lot of questions... Bol.

610
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:03,000
I... [swallows]

611
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,125
They're gonna ask you
why you're not adapting.

612
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,309
- Adapting?
- [Mark] Adapting.

613
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,625
We are adapting.

[sighs]

617
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:25,341
I used to work in a bank, too,
believe it not,

618
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,791
back in the day,
before they moved all the jobs...

619
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,708
abroad.

620
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:31,791
[chair creaking]

621
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,833
[sighs] The point is, many of us, we end
up in places we never thought we'd be.

622
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:38,541
But I think...

623
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:42,125
I think that's life trying to show you
what kind of man you are.

624
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:45,041
Do you know what I'm sayin'?

625
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:47,791
I'm tryin' to work out
what kind of man you are, Bol.

626
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,291
I just need a new house.

627
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,934
- And we'll get you one.
- [pen clicking]

628
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,375
Right after the inquiry.

629
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:54,458
- [Bol] Inquiry?
- Yeah.

630
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,333
Look at the state of you. You're a mess.
You don't look well, mate, you look ill.

631
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:00,541
You don't smell good. You smell bad.

632
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:04,791
You're not making any sense.
It would have to be reported. And then...

633
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,583
people, not me,
but people are then gonna ask,

634
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:10,750
"Why is he bitin'
the hand that's feedin' him?"

635
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:13,916
- We can live anywhere else.
- There's rats everywhere.

636
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,240
- Anywhere else.
- Oh, right. So it's not about the rats.

637
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:21,291
[sighs] There's something... very wrong

638
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:22,625
- in...
- What is that?

639
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:26,291
- What is it? Tell me.
- [laughs]

640
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,833
Can't be that bad, you're laughin'.

641
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:34,833
If you want me to make a fuss,
mate, I will make a fuss.

642
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:37,166
- Yes!
- If you want me to do it, then I will.

643
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,500
Yes! [laughs]

644
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,333
[glass crunches and snaps]

645
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:04,875
[Mark] Bol.

646
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,250
Hang on.

650
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,833
[woman] Why don't you just leave?

651
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,333
What?

652
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:54,833
Why don't you just leave?

653
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,083
We live here now.

654
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:59,458
They're gonna kick you out anyway.

655
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:01,791
I'm tryin' to help you.

656
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,375
I'll give it a week.

[dog barking]

659
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,666
Must be big rats.

660
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,250
Telling me that rats...

661
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:34,250
did this?

662
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:38,208
Come on, man.

663
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:44,125
Well, I'm...
I'm gonna have to report it now.

664
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,791
Please. Please...

665
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,000
No, I'm gonna have to.
I'm gonna have to take photos.

666
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:49,833
- No, please. No.
- [shutter clicking]

667
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:51,000
No. No!

668
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,000
Let me fix it.

669
00:55:58,041 --> 00:55:59,541
We are not going back.

670
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:02,208
Please.

671
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:05,583
We are one of the good ones. Remember?

672
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:09,416
We are not going back.

673
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,375
Yep. All right then, mist...

674
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:20,000
Mr. Majur, we will let you off
with a warning this time.

675
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:22,083
- Hang... hang on a minute.
- Let me deal with it.

676
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:24,375
[Rial] Have you told them about the witch?

677
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:27,083
[footsteps]

678
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:31,083
You haven't told them?

679
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:33,875
[scoffs]

680
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:38,166
There's a great beast in this house.

681
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:40,791
It followed us here.

682
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,625
My husband's been chasing it
all night with a hammer.

683
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:49,041
It knows great magic.

684
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:52,625
It's filling this house with ghosts.

685
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:57,166
It torments my husband
with visits from her.

686
00:56:58,541 --> 00:56:59,916
Nyagak.

687
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:05,666
But my husband is a very stubborn man.

688
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:10,916
He still believes he can deny it.

689
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:13,875
You should put that into your report.

690
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:21,916
- [men shouting]
- [dog barking]

691
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:23,833
[Mark] We'd better write 'em up.

692
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:25,666
They can kiss England goodbye.

693
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:28,055
[man] Dude, she was wearing her bedsheets.

694
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:29,625
[Rial] This is what they want.

695
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:33,541
- They like to see us crazy.
- [van engine starts]

696
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,875
- Makes them feel like big men.
- [van drives off]

697
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:43,708
They don't want to be reminded
that it is them that are weak.

698
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:46,375
How poor...

699
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,291
and lazy...

700
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:51,333
and bored they are.

701
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:52,458
Rial.

702
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:56,541
Now, sorry.

703
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:00,875
- Sorry, sorry, sorry...
- Rial.

704
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,833
And you...

705
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:09,750
You still idolize them.

706
00:58:13,666 --> 00:58:15,708
[laughing] You beg them.

707
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:20,625
And then you thank them
for the unseasoned scraps they throw us.

708
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,708
You eat them up.

709
00:58:32,666 --> 00:58:34,291
Let them send us back.

710
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:36,666
But this is our home.

711
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:40,708
We're going back.

712
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:45,375
I'm leaving. With or without you.

713
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:51,250
How quickly you forget everything
we went through to get here.

714
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:55,541
How quickly you forget our daugh...

715
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,791
You are sick.

716
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:31,041
This is our home.

717
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:38,208
You are not going anywhere.

718
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:00,708
[thump]

719
01:00:17,416 --> 01:00:20,666
This time, you talk to me.

720
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:14,500
[breathing slowly]

721
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:22,125

Hm.

1012
01:23:58,125 --> 01:23:59,875
Are you completely mad?

All right, then.
