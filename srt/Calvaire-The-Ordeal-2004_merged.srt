1
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,570
Day by day, my life's
turning to survival.

2
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:53,240
Money flies. What a
strange time we live in.

3
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,170
Everything's torn apart.

4
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,100
Since love is our only hope,

5
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,740
and unity's a powerful force.

6
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,350
Let's go together,

7
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,040
on a dream cruise.

8
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,760
Bring your week next to mine,

9
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:28,240
that'll make us a fair two-weeks.

10
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,000
We'll face anything with tenderness.

11
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,010
A velvet game,

12
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,280
that could last for ever.

13
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:49,640
Bring your week next to mine,

14
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,430
that'll make us a fair two-weeks.

15
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,960
We'll be together as
the mind and the body.

16
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:13,000
For all our life, we'll do fifty-fifty.

17
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,800
Merry Christmas everybody !

18
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,730
I'm really happy to meet you again.

19
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,020
A new year is about to begin,

20
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,470
I wish you a year full of joy

21
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,840
full of happiness, but above all...

22
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,330
full of songs...

23
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,330
...love songs, of course.

24
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,480
Yes, come in.

25
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,720
Come in, have a seat.

26
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,360
I'm just taking this off.

27
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,500
Marc, it was such a pleasure again.

28
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,920
Thanks Mrs Langolf. May I help you?

29
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,990
Your songs are a source
of youth for me...

30
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,400
a source of memories...

31
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,860
You know...

32
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,550
next year...

33
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,560
I may not be here, when you come back.

34
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,800
Don't be silly, you'll be here.

35
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,680
May I ask you something?

36
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,580
Of course, anything you want...

37
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,420
You looked at me during the show.

38
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,690
I don't know what happened
to me... I'm sorry.

39
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,830
I can't believe it,
you dirty old bitch...

40
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,320
You cunt, look what you've
done... you've ruined it all.

41
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,050
Where are you going now?

42
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,850
South...for a Christmas show.

43
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,930
Some producers should be there.

44
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,380
I hope you'll come
back when you're a star.

45
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,500
Of course I'll come back. Excuse me.

46
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,890
Everybody loves you here
Marc, you know that ?

47
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,380
Well, I gotta go...

48
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,730
Oh, of course...

49
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,100
Thanks a lot.

50
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,440
Marc...Marc.

51
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,120
May I kiss you before you go ?

52
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,770
We will miss you.

53
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,530
Oh Marc...we will miss you.

54
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,910
Please let me go now.

55
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,380
I gotta go.

56
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

57
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

58
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,160
Did you see a dog...a short haired dog?

59
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,710
That big...with short hair.

60
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,230
Excuse me?

61
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,230
I'm looking for my dog.

62
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,230
I saw something on the road...
couldn't tell if it was a dog.

63
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,340
You saw her ?

64
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,440
No, I saw something cross the road,
but I can't tell if it was her.

65
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,890
Where did she go?

66
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,290
I don't know... this way I think.

67
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,950
There, this way...

68
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,520
Hey come back ! Come back
young man ! Come back !

69
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,810
Hey young man...come back!

70
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,990
My name's Boris.

71
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,500
Ok Boris, can you help me ?

72
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,880
My van's stuck and I
saw a sign for an inn.

73
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,780
The inn ? The inn isn't far away.

74
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,820
But I gotta find Bella.

75
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,210
Just tell me where it
is, that's all I need.

76
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,040
Can you please tell
me where the inn is ?

77
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,860
Follow me. But be quiet,
so I can hear Bella.

78
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,110
Hey wait, I can't live my van here !

79
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,650
I asked you to be quiet.

80
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,580
Are you sure I can leave
my van there all night ?

81
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,680
Are we getting close now ?

82
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,060
Sir, I asked you to be quiet, and it
means being silent with your mouth.

83
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,580
Mister Bartel !

84
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,850
Mister Bartel !

85
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,490
I got someone for you.

86
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,250
He's coming down.

87
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,470
I got someone for you Mr
Bartel. He needs a room.

88
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,210
Good evening.

89
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,050
Evening.

90
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,130
I'm sorry to wake you up,
my van broke down and...

91
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,590
Allright, come in.

92
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,120
The rooms have been empty for quite a
while, but don't worry, they're clean.

93
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,320
Here you are.

94
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,570
Good night.

95
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,850
You slept well artist?

96
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,090
Very well, thank you.

97
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,710
I towed your van,

98
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,830
I know a bit of
mechanics, if I can help...

99
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,360
Thanks, but...

100
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,520
Among colleagues, that's natural...

101
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,300
Hey, I've read the
inscription. Move away please.

102
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,680
Singer? I'm an artist
too...well I was. A humorist

103
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,830
You're an artist for life, but
it's not what it used to be...

104
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,460
I hope you didn't tow my
van with the handbrake on.

105
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,940
So we're like...colleagues.

106
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,530
I'm going to fix you a breakfast,
I'll check your engine afterwards.

107
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,300
Can't we call a mechanic?
I don't want to disturb you.

108
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,110
Bella.

109
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,680
There must be a mechanic around here.

110
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,240
- We could call...
- Shut up

111
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,420
Since he lost his dog, he's
not the same guy anymore.

112
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,060
You got a phone inside?

113
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,670
May I?

114
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,970
You must have a phone inside.

115
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,000
Excuse me?

116
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,290
Do you have a phone inside ?

117
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,130
Of course I have a
phone... what do you think ?

118
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:40,510
Oh...all right...yes...
so...when will he be back ?

119
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:47,010
This afternoon ? Maybe ?
Are you sure or not ?

120
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,970
All right, all right, thanks, good bye.

121
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,620
- It was his wife.
- So?

122
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,120
He's working outside. He's busy
for the afternoon, maybe longer.

123
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,000
Don't worry... I'm gonna
have a look at your engine.

124
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,700
- Are you such in a hurry ?
- I've got quite a long road.

125
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,820
Where are you going?

126
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,610
South, for a Christmas show.

127
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,800
Christmas! It's in 2 days.

128
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,800
An artist like you should rest
for a while from times to times..

129
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,710
You must be right.

130
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,410
Come on, I'm gonna fix you a good breakfast,
then I'll have a look at your machine.

131
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,110
Thanks Sir.

132
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,460
Bartel. Call me Bartel. No
Sir here, only an artist.

133
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,690
All right Bartel.

134
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,880
Have a seat.

135
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,380
Can I help you?

136
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,850
No, no...I'm sure you don't know
a thing about mechanics, do you ?

137
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,850
You're right, I must admit that.

138
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,250
That's what I thought. I'm taking
care of this, go get some rest.

139
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,660
I was going to walk around

140
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,500
I should advise you against
going to the village.

141
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,950
Why ?

142
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,060
Because they're not like you and me...

143
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,150
They're not artists.

144
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,660
So please, don't go there.

145
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,790
OK, but tell me why.

146
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:36,860
Because they are...they
can.... they...they are...

147
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Ok, Bartel, calm down, I
won't go to the village.

148
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,400
- You promise?
- Yeah I promise.

149
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,880
See you later.

150
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,220
So, have a good walk my friend !

151
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,200
Be careful, paths are slippery
at this time of the year...

152
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,020
- You're driving me crazy.
-

153
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,800
- Marc, we love you.
-

154
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,810
- Marc, come back soon !
-

155
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,060
- Oh Marc, if you knew...
-

156
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,320
- I languish for you
-

157
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:55,200
That's a good one,
he's fine, he's tender.

158
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,590
Go ahead.

159
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,920
Come on kid...

160
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,740
and what am I supposed to do ?

161
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,520
I never said it was your fault.

162
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,250
All right, All right.

163
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,480
So ! How was your walk ?

164
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,520
It's very nice around here.

165
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,840
You went to the village ?

166
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,980
No, I just walked in the surroundings.

167
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,100
Anything new ?

168
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:28,110
I worked hard on your van...
The engine's all right,

169
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,690
I think it's the battery.

170
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,740
I just talked to the mechanic's
wife, he could fix it...

171
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,490
...but tomorrow.
- Tomorrow ?

172
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,060
That's what I told them !

173
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,440
I'm gonna try to start it again.

174
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,830
Marc, wait...wait.

175
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,850
You can't start it, I've
spent the afternoon trying.

176
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,430
Trust me.

177
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,540
Don't insist.

178
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,090
I understand, you're disapointed...
I can understand that.

179
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,460
I'm gonna fix you a good dinner,
you'll taste Bartel's cooking,

180
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,980
and I promise you'll leave tomorrow.

181
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:13,350
Here you are. Lard and
potatoes au gratin, with cream.

182
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,450
It's my specialty.

183
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:21,520
It was... when the inn was still open.

184
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,790
A lot of peole used to come here...

185
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,870
...especially artists.

186
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,150
Now that Gloria's gone...
it's not the same anymore.

187
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,890
Gloria. My wife.

188
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,120
You're married ?

189
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,450
I called her my wife, but she left me.

190
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,800
She was a singer, just like you.

191
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,000
Very talented.

192
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,410
You should have heard her.

193
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,440
I'm sorry to bring back bad memories.

194
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,900
How could you know...

195
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,110
So what's the problem?
With the villagers I mean.

196
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,550
You should have heard
her. It's was marvelous.

197
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,210
She was everything for me.

198
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,980
I lost everything when she left me.

199
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,930
That's why I'm so happy
to meet another artist.

200
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,650
I'm gonna show you something.

201
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,860
You see. It's written
on it. First prize.

202
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,920
I won it thanks to my sense of humor.

203
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:05,390
When she left, Bartel's
sense of humor left too.

204
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,230
Bartel's fantasy...gone.

205
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,400
While when she was here,
when Gloria was here,

206
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,990
I was happy all the time,

207
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,100
I was crooning all day long...

208
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,700
I was kidding,

209
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,030
I was always the first
one to crack a joke...

210
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,960
Listen. A dwarves association...

211
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,260
...decides to create a football club.

212
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,230
So...

213
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,490
They play games every Sunday.

214
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,870
and... they meet in a bar, on the
first floor, in a private room.

215
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:50,480
One sunday, there's this
guy, standing at the bar,

216
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,660
he's quite messed up already,

217
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,530
and then he sees 2 dwarves,

218
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,670
dressed in blue, coming down the stairs.

219
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:01,160
then 3, then 4, 5, 6, 10, 11 !

220
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,990
He thinks he's having hallucinations,

221
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,300
then, he pours himself...
he orders another whisky,

222
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,860
then he sees dwarves
again, dressed in red,

223
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:15,500
coming down the stairs, 2, 3, 5, 11 !

224
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,530
He orders another whisky,
and calls the bartender,

225
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,570
and he says...

226
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,910
I don't want to worry you,

227
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,560
but I think your
Foosball's running away !

228
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,310
Your Foosball's running away !

229
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,340
That's a good one, isn't it ?

230
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,940
And I'm not telling it right !

231
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,030
Back in the days,

232
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,240
People were rolling
on the floor laughing.

233
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,000
You know why ?

234
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,690
Enthusiasm Marc.

235
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,210
Enthusiasm I tell you.

236
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,980
Enthusiasm is the key to success.

237
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,190
When Gloria left,

238
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:00,620
I decided to fill my head with work,

239
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,830
I decided to write an essay, "Notions...

240
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:10,460
...of enthusiasm in the principles
of humor. " It was the title.

241
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,700
I never finished it.

242
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:17,320
I never finished it, 'cause
when a woman leaves you...

243
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,150
You become a mess.

244
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,090
It was very good.

245
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,260
But I got a long road
tomorrow. I need to sleep.

246
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,510
Already ?

247
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,080
You're gonna leave without...

248
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,160
...singing me a song ?

249
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,480
I beg your pardon ?

250
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,760
You got to sing me a
song... show me your talent.

251
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,630
I don't know, it's late and I'm tired.

252
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,380
Come on, don't make me beg
you. We're both artists.

253
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,080
I did told you a story.

254
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,140
Ok, but I don't know what
to sing, I got no music...

255
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,940
Improvise.

256
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,760
A love song. Love
songs are always great.

257
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,430
I told you: enthusiasm is the key.

258
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,870
Like a rose of May,

259
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,440
Youth and beauty were given to you,

260
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,830
Me, in the dark, staring at my life,

261
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,540
I see too many looks shining with envy,

262
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:43,060
You're too beautiful and too
sensual, for a guy like me.

263
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,890
I've the simple dream, of a peaceful
happiness, you couldn't give me.

264
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,260
Here you are.

265
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,890
You mean that's all ?

266
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,690
I didn't tell you half a story.

267
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,220
You have to finish that song.

268
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:13,490
You're too beautiful and flirting
wouldn't be enough for me.

269
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,390
I'd like to offer you my bed,

270
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,610
but for all my life.

271
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,960
Even the dove, happy in its nest,

272
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:32,400
sometimes flies away,
for ever to infinity.

273
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:37,670
I'm afraid, but am I right or wrong,

274
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:45,440
that some day you fly away,
making for new horizons.

275
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:51,630
You're too beautiful and too
sensual, for a guy like me.

276
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:58,220
I've the simple dream, of a peaceful
happiness, you couldn't give me.

277
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:04,730
You're too beautiful and flirting
wouldn't be enough for me.

278
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,060
I'd like to offer you my bed,

279
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,550
but for all my life.

280
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,700
This time it's over.

281
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,150
I'm going to bed. Don't
forget to wake me up tomorrow.

282
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,820
- Marc.
- Yes ?

283
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,540
Thanks for this wonderful moment.

284
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,010
Bartel ?

285
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,600
Anybody here ?

286
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,480
Bella !

287
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,220
Boris.

288
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,920
I'm looking for Bartel.

289
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,450
- You hear me ?
- Leave me alone.

290
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,580
Please answer me. You saw him ?

291
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,560
- I'll never find her again.
- Who ?

292
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,460
Bella, my dog.

293
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,170
I'm sorry about your dog
but did you see Bartel ?

294
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,650
She's alone in the woods.

295
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,600
In the cold.

296
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:27,050
Bella...Bella...

297
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,700
Boris do you hear me ?
I'm looking for Bartel.

298
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,960
Lost.

299
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,020
- Boris.
- She must be so afraid...

300
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,910
Can I help you ?

301
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:19,030
I was looking for you. The
door was open, I thought...

302
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,070
I was ordering a new
battery for your van.

303
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,930
The mechanic should be here
soon. Just wait a little more.

304
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,760
You didn't wake me up and
I got a problem with my van.

305
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:34,730
You were sleeping so well I
didn't want to woke you up...

306
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:44,760
You found it? You left
it yesterday night...

307
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,210
I was about to give it back to you.

308
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,760
What are you doing ?

309
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,130
You're crazy !

310
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,250
Stop !

311
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,970
Calm down Bartel, I
don't wanna hurt you.

312
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:46,230
That's what you're looking for ?

313
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,870
That's what you're looking for !

314
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:55,570
Why do you leave now you're back,
you wanna step on my heart again ?

315
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,450
What are you doing ?

316
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:12,250
Bartel...I won't tell
anybody Let me go...

317
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:59,550
You see. It's easier when
you don't move your head.

318
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,650
I'm doing this to protect you.

319
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:15,610
I don't like making you ugly.

320
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,490
I'm suffering as much as you do.

321
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,370
I'm happy too.

322
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,690
It's gonna be the greatest
Christmas that ever took place here.

323
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,300
Where is my axe ?

324
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,680
You know, the one with an oak handle...

325
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:26,190
You should know that.

326
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:29,730
You never put things at the same place.

327
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,920
Here it is ! We're gonna
find the best Christmas tree,

328
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,510
and you'll decorate it.

329
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,930
You always loved to hang balls up,

330
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:43,890
stars, garlands, that's
you thing, isn't it ?

331
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:50,660
You try to leave me again,
I cut you in two like a log !

332
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,050
Let's go.

333
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:59,150
You got a ticket to ride ?

334
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:10,830
You hear ? Bartel's laugh !

335
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,720
My enthusiasm is back, thanks to you !

336
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,820
Let's go.

337
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,600
Hey ho, let's go !

338
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:40,400
You see that, like a young man.

339
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,220
Bitch !

340
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,240
What a fucking bitch !

341
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:22,710
What a fucking damn bitch !

342
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:26,470
Gloria...Gloria...

343
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:22,570
Gloria !

344
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,130
Gloria for Christ sake !

345
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,680
Anybody here ?

346
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:14,430
Boris.

347
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,390
Daddy promise to Bella he'll find her.

348
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:27,520
Bella won't stay alone in the woods.
- Untie me.

349
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,620
Untie me.

350
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:57,470
Boris...come back... come
back, untie me Boris...

351
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,000
Here you are Mr Bartel.

00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,920
Cheer up Boris,

353
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,670
You'll find your dog.

354
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:02,010
But you got to insist. Obstinacy pays.

355
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,420
Obstinacy's the key.

356
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:09,880
So, you're coming with us ?

357
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:13,200
No thanks. I'm gonna do like
you said. I'm gonna insist.

358
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:17,250
You're damn right to
insist ! I gotta go.

359
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:24,870
You see what you make me do.

360
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,770
What's in your head ?

361
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:36,660
I don't like it either, but
you don't want to understand.

362
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:17,120
You, don't forget I know.

363
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,520
I forgive you, but I
know what's going on.

364
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:08,800
A beer.

365
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,750
Two beers.

366
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,770
A beer I said.

367
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,290
I'm here to warn you.

368
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:03,410
I'm gonna be happy. Starting now.

369
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:08,350
All I want is to live in peace.

370
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,940
You understand ?

371
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:29,080
- I'll kill anyone looking at my wife.
- Your wife ?

372
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,810
Why do you think she's your wife ?

373
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,330
Probably his sense of humor.

374
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:43,610
Don't come around my house
anymore. You hear me ?

375
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,250
Stick your threats up your ass.

376
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,440
She's my wife.

377
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:57,430
My wife.

378
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,830
You've been warned.

379
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,330
What do you want ?

380
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:17,130
Good.

381
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:33,840
Good to eat Bartel's
soup again, isn't it?

382
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,710
Eat slowly.

383
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,890
We're gonna live just
like before, aren't we ?

384
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,670
Aren't we ?

385
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,500
Watch out, it's pouring everywhere.

386
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,540
I thinked about it you know.

387
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,710
We're gonna reopen the inn.

388
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:18,640
You'll sing of course,
I'll do the support act.

389
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,710
I don't want to worry you,

390
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:25,560
but I think your
Foosball's running away.

391
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,050
I found Bella.

392
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:07,740
That's great Boris.

393
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,410
I did like you said
Mr Bartel. I insisted,

394
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:11,670
and I found Bella.

395
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:14,440
I insisted and I found Bella.

396
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,980
So let's drink.

397
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,150
Let's drink to Christmas
miracles gathering the lovers.

398
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:26,820
I insisted... and I found Bella.

399
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:39,440
- How does she look ?
- She looks good. That's great.

400
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:46,430
I think you're great too.

401
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,960
- Are you all right Mr Bartel ?
- I'm all right.

402
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:16,120
Bella came back home,
Gloria came back home.

403
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,730
We're all together for Christmas.

404
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:21,100
I love you, you're my family.

405
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:24,440
You hear that ? We're family !

406
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,450
Don't move.

407
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:41,410
Help me...

408
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:44,290
Help me...

409
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:47,160
Rescue me.

410
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:06,150
I got it dad, let's go.

411
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:23,290
What's going on ?

412
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,920
Shut up bitch.

413
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,600
Come on, sing.

414
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:34,800
Sing I said.

415
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:46,170
Come on, sing. Better than this.

416
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,400
Come on.

417
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:19,920
- Yeah come on.
- Come on, come on, come on...

418
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,900
Shut the fuck up !

419
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:28,670
Why did you come back Gloria ?

420
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,140
I loved you.

421
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:38,220
I'm not Gloria. I'm Marc Stevens.

422
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,430
A singer.

423
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:44,610
Liar ! Damn liar !

424
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:48,880
You left like a whore,
you'll pay like a whore.

425
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:58,380
- You wanna fuck her ?
- Yeah ! - So fuck her !

426
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:06,460
Don't touch my wife or I kill you all !

427
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:12,410
- Kid !
- Daddy !

428
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:23,750
- Daddy...
- Kid...kid...kid...

429
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:28,030
Run away, quick, run, run !

430
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:09,700
- Let's go.
- Come on, find the bitch, find the bitch...

431
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,910
What ?

432
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:34,460
We've reached the swamps.

433
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:42,960
You find her. Then you
can do anything to her.

434
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,030
Come on.

435
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:55,810
Come on.

436
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,640
Come.

437
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:31,410
Gloria...

438
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,400
Why did you come back Gloria ?

439
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:14,890
Did you love me a bit ?
You loved me right ?

440
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:21,020
Tell me, tell me you loved me.

441
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,590
Say it...say it !

442
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:29,230
Louder...louder !

443
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,370
I loved you.
