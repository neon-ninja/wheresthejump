1
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,038
<i>I've been interested</i>

2
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,974
<i>in monsters my entire life,</i>
<i>since I was, er,</i>

3
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:43,075
<i>old enough to watch TV.</i>

4
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,630
I was never really
scared by them.

5
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:50,349
I just liked them as characters.

6
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,317
<i>Like they were</i>
<i>my Mickey and Goofy.</i>

7
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,486
I'm really into monsters,

8
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,688
just as an escape, you know?

9
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,558
It gives you something
to put your fears on.

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,061
I was in a mental hospital
for a few weeks

11
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,562
when I was about 14 or 15.

12
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,998
I was diagnosed
with depression and anxiety

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>and I didn't know why</i>
<i>I was sick.</i>

14
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:11,770
What really helped me escape
my reality was these things

15
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,739
that I was influenced by
as a kid which is watching

16
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,541
<i>horror movies</i>
<i>and drawing these monsters.</i>

17
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,009
I have been a monster,

18
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:18,710
I always will be a monster

19
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,413
and after I'm dead
I will be a dead monster.

20
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,282
Somehow I got to see
<i>Frankenstein</i>

21
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,951
which I looked at many,
many, many, many times,

22
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,719
and there was a certain humor

23
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,390
to<i> Frankenstein</i> and a certain,
er, niceness, er...

24
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,092
I always wanted
the monster to live.

25
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,627
I grew up an only child,
so they were my friends.

26
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,262
I lived
with my imaginary friends.

27
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,931
It's what, I think,

28
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,600
provided the background
for what I do in my acting now.

29
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,268
I think a lot of it was just

30
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,772
as visceral as
really ugly things,

31
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,874
<i>really frightening things,</i>

32
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,443
<i>holding my attention more than</i>
<i>beautiful, pretty things.</i>

33
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,812
We like the costumes,
we like the character designs,

34
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:57,983
we like the underdogs,
the misunderstood, antiheroes,

35
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,452
because they explore
different parts of humanity

36
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,087
that aren't often explored.

37
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,555
There're all kind of things

38
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,457
that, if we hadn't been
introduced to them,

39
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,126
we'd call them monsters.

40
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,627
There are monsters everywhere.

41
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,396
You know what the real monsters
are? It's frigging insects.

42
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,765
<i>They got claws.</i>
<i>They got antennas.</i>

43
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:14,967
<i>They got multiple eyes.</i>

44
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,903
They got pincers.
And they walk sideways at times.

45
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:21,507
That's a creature. People don't
walk sideways. That's stupid.

46
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,108
I feel kind of strange,

47
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,977
but I think that some monsters
could be real.

48
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,779
I think monsters exist
everywhere where we can't see.

49
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,616
I think, behind that chair,
just because I can't see it,

50
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:31,618
there is something there.

51
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,684
If they did exist,

52
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,687
they'd exist somewhere
where man doesn't live.

53
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:36,922
They couldn't be
out in the open,

54
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,045
people would shoot them.

55
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,926
You would find them
buried deep in the world.

56
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:44,763
Tromaville, which is
a very small town in New Jersey.

57
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:49,034
It doesn't matter because
if you're terrified of them,

58
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,235
they exist.

59
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,672
When we do find monsters,
if these things do come up

60
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,341
from the ground
or ascend upon us, like,

61
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,745
I just wanna be there to be,
"I told you so."

62
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,702
My name is Adam Green.

63
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,204
As a filmmaker

64
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:29,808
who has had some success
in the horror genre,

65
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,344
I... Can we just do this
with graphics?

66
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,712
No, just keep going.

67
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,248
I've made movies like<i> Frozen</i>,

68
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,985
<i>the</i> Hatchet<i> franchise,</i>
<i>er,</i> Spiral.

69
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,653
<i>I have a TV series</i>
<i>called</i> Holliston.

70
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:46,992
With that comes a very loyal
and cult fan base.

71
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:50,028
Stop! I feel like
a big enough<i> douche</i>

72
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,330
and you keep laughing at me.

73
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,366
You get to meet some
very unique people...

74
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:57,336
Like, er,
people will mail stuff.

75
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:00,672
This Victor Crowley<i> maquette</i>
that somebody made.

76
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,508
This fan's underwear.

77
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,012
This bottle of pills
that somebody sent.

78
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,680
Really cool stuff like artwork

79
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,182
that people will make for us.

80
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,017
Um, which is awesome.

81
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,887
There was this one guy,
er, William Dekker.

82
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,359
I wish I had thought to be
shooting this the moment

83
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,894
this stuff first arrived,
er, but...

84
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:23,962
Say it!

85
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:28,267
OK, all right. William Dekker
claims, in all seriousness,

86
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:32,271
that he's found monsters.

87
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:36,041
<i>And he wants me</i>
<i>to tell his story to the world.</i>

88
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,449
Is that good enough?

89
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,886
I think we should
hire an actor to play you.

90
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,414
Dick!

91
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,073
I'm so excited,
she could explode.

92
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,808
I could explode. And I have!

93
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,949
I love<i> Holliston.</i>

94
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,518
I have a tattoo of<i> Holliston.</i>

95
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,619
Tell me what's on your arm.

96
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,255
I like<i> Frankenstein</i>.

97
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:25,357
<i>Spiral, Frozen.</i>

98
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:28,193
Yeah, I consider myself
to be an Adam Green fan.

99
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:33,332
I have a really cool
relationship with my fans,

100
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:36,968
and I think that that's because

101
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,804
like, when I was first
starting out,

102
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:41,406
y'know, when you're making
an independent movie,

103
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,643
you don't have marketing
or advertisements,

104
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,545
so you really gotta do it
yourself

105
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:47,946
and put yourself out there,

106
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,649
so people know about you
and know about your movie

107
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,718
and after a while though, like,

108
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,053
the more movies you make
and the more people

109
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,522
there are that want a piece
of you, it just kinda starts to,

110
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,825
I don't know,
I guess, takes its toll.

111
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:03,362
Now, the ones who do get through
are the ones who actually

112
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,397
take the time to write,

113
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,166
<i>like, a physical letter</i>
<i>to my fan mail address.</i>

114
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,328
<i>And that's huge, you know,</i>

115
00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:10,973
<i>when someone's gonna</i>
<i>take the time</i>

116
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:13,038
<i>and write you</i>
<i>a long letter or send you,</i>

117
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,209
<i>I don't know, like drawings,</i>
<i>art, fan-fiction,</i>

118
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,379
sometimes really personal stuff,
I mean, it's awesome. So I...

119
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,669
Oh, sorry. Hold on.
It's the wife.

120
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,417
Hello.

121
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,485
<i>Hello.</i>

122
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:27,786
Hey, how are you?

123
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,821
<i>Oh, good! Where you at?</i>

124
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,923
Er, I'm with Will.

125
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,593
<i>Hi, Will.</i>
- Hi, Rileah.

126
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:37,062
<i>Do you know when</i>
<i>you're gonna be home?</i>

127
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,432
Er, ah, I dunno, five or six.

128
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:44,336
I think, um, we're gonna go
sit down with the guy now.

129
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:47,773
<i>Seriously?</i>
<i>Oh, you guys are idiots.</i>

130
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,508
You guys are idiots!

131
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,878
<i>Here we are at the</i>
<i>residence of Mr. William Dekker.</i>

132
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,114
I'm sorry,
Detective William Dekker,

133
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,450
the monster hunter guy.

134
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,520
I've already come here twice
before to sit down with him,

135
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,555
and the last time I asked him

136
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,798
if he would be cool
with us putting him on camera.

137
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,460
He didn't say no...

138
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:12,264
Now you people know they're not
to talk about this to anybody?

139
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,300
Oh, no. That's, like, standard
on everything we do. Everybody...

140
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,369
I didn't realize there were
going to be so many here.

141
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,538
Well, you want it
to look good, right?

142
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,907
I mean,
it's gotta be professional.

143
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:26,111
Which, actually, guys,
can you just... Here, my...

144
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,633
Here, my...
OK.

145
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,982
And is this eye good, or is...

146
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,984
No, you're fine.

147
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,386
I... you're sure? 'Cause I...

148
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,555
Yeah. Fine. You have enough.

149
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:37,889
About to roll!

150
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,025
<i>- All right, we're ready.</i>
<i>- Take one.</i>

151
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,361
<i>My name is William Dekker.</i>

152
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,465
I am a retired police detective.

153
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:50,168
I'm 61 years old and
I live in Southern California,

154
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,970
er, Chatsworth.

155
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,673
I have lived here
for the last four years.

156
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,242
Erm, now, I know
you've already told me this

157
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,511
but just for the sake
of the cameras,

158
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,247
basically,
what you're saying is that

159
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:06,151
you've discovered a world
underneath

160
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:11,356
our own world
where monsters live.

161
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,258
Every generation,

162
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,996
there are born children
who are different,

163
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,700
<i>And these 'different children'</i>

164
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,169
<i>are given cruel labels like</i>

165
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:28,106
<i>'monsters',</i>
<i>'freaks', 'rejects'.</i>

166
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,675
<i>And these children reach</i>

167
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,345
<i>a certain age</i>
<i>and they disappear</i>

168
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,846
<i>and nobody knows where they go.</i>

169
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,683
<i>And what's worse, they don't</i>
<i>even care that they vanish.</i>

170
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,919
<i>But I do.</i>

171
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,688
I do.

172
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,684
See, these children,
they don't die.

173
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,862
They're not even
far away from us.

174
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,898
They're right next to us.

175
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,401
<i>But they exist</i>
<i>in their own world.</i>

176
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,470
I call it

177
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,872
"The Marrow".

178
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,809
<i>Some 100 yards beneath</i>
<i>the surface of the Earth,</i>

179
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,946
<i>exists a metropolis</i>

180
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,984
that mirrors ours
in very many respects.

181
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,822
Life goes on down there,
there are marriages,

182
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,058
and births,
and divorces, and deaths,

183
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,895
and friendships,
and er... creativity.

184
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,332
They can be free.

185
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,269
OK, so why don't we,
kinda start at the beginning?

186
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,871
Let's talk about your childhood.

187
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,040
Tell me a little bit
about growing up.

188
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:38,009
Well, I was born, um,

189
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:42,247
into, I guess you could say,
a lower middle-class family

190
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,916
in Nashua, New Hampshire.

191
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,685
<i>I was a latchkey kid,</i>

192
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,187
<i>I didn't have any brothers</i>
<i>and sisters and I, uh,</i>

193
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,623
I didn't have any real friends
to speak of.

194
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,327
So I, er, had to occupy myself.

195
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,129
<i>There was a special spot</i>
<i>that I always went to.</i>

196
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,067
<i>And there was an old lumber</i>
<i>company, er, you know,</i>

197
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,303
<i>that sold board feet,</i>
<i>you know, lumber.</i>

198
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,373
<i>And it was all closed down</i>
<i>and locked up</i>

199
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,476
and the buildings there would
by my fortress,

200
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,111
be my castle, you know?

201
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,615
And I used to, er,
I used to defend my fortress

202
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,284
against the invading
barbarian hoards.

203
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,820
I had a hell of an imagination.

204
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,655
I bet!

205
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,257
You bet.

206
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,926
Yeah. Um...

207
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:31,029
It was rather late
in the evening, as I remember,

208
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,598
and I was late for supper,
I knew my mom was...

209
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,799
she was going to kill me,

210
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,134
so I came running out of
the main building

211
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,069
where I played primarily, and...

212
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,739
And as I came out
into the yard I...

213
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,744
I saw a man standing
by an old wood-pile.

214
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,547
As I drew closer to him...

215
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,323
Where am I?

216
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,662
I'm looking at his face,

217
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,791
and it doesn't look human.

218
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,270
No, he had a, he had a mouth
like a serpent's mouth.

219
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,606
It was sort of pointed

220
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,043
and it had real
thin lips and, er,

221
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,078
splayed over
the bottom lip was, uh,

222
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,449
I swear to God, a forked tongue.

223
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,819
And then when he blinked,

224
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,689
his eyelids
closed from the sides,

225
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,657
not horizontally up and down,

226
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,059
it was like...

227
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,595
I'd never seen anything
like that before in my life.

228
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,564
It terrified me.

229
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,965
Did he say anything to you?

230
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,636
No, he didn't say a word.
He just looked at me,

231
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:49,307
hard, and then he jumped
behind a wood-pile,

232
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,544
and I, and I ran around
the corner of the wood-pile.

233
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,945
He was gone.

234
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,781
Just, gone? He just vanished?

235
00:11:57,771 --> 00:11:59,851
- He's disappeared.
- Here one second, gone the next.

236
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,886
Gone, vanished..

237
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,022
So, did you ever
tell anybody about it?

238
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,524
- Like your mom or your dad...
- No...

239
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,166
And they wouldn't
have believed me anyway,

240
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,994
they would've thought I was
some kind of a nut, you know?

241
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:13,164
The overactive imagination
on wha... on their boy,

242
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,799
You know?

243
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,002
Probably would've thought I was
schizophrenic or something.

244
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,239
You know?

245
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,941
Yeah. Er...

246
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,909
And I felt that way
sometimes too.

247
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,613
Talking to my imaginary,
er, friends in the woods.

248
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,351
And I, er, never saw him again,
I did see others, though.

249
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,553
Oh, yeah...

250
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,756
Other, serpent, monster men?

251
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,924
Not serpent men,
I just saw other,

252
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,893
different ones, OK?

253
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,261
So, like a variety?

254
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,463
I-I never got
as close to any of them

255
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,532
as I did that first one, but,

256
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,936
if I hid in one of the buildings
'till it got dark,

257
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,372
and I looked into the woods,

258
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,877
I'd see their shapes,
moving through the woods.

259
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,580
<i>And there were big ones,</i>
<i>lumbering.</i>

260
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,049
<i>And there were little ones</i>
<i>that were darting in and out.</i>

261
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,486
<i>I saw their shapes. I saw them.</i>

262
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,055
<i>Well, anyway,</i>
<i>after about three months,</i>

263
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,825
er, I shot some footage there.

264
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,561
Oh, you got footage of,
of the monsters?

265
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,163
No, it was daytime.

266
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,899
I couldn't get
any footage of them.

267
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:21,941
So what did you get?

268
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,669
<i>Well, I found</i>

269
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,238
<i>what I believe to be</i>

270
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,308
<i>the entrance</i>

271
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,844
<i>to their hiding place.</i>

272
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,680
<i>The Marrow?</i>

273
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,349
The Marrow.

274
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:43,087
So, what do you think?
It's not a bad first day, right?

275
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,155
No, it was good.

276
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:45,657
It gets more comfortable...

277
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,625
Hey! Tell him not to touch that.

278
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,461
He's not... those aren't...
Those are our cords, it's fine.

279
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,430
What do you guys think?
Ten minutes to get outta here?

280
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,865
It took me 30 years
to get all this stuff together.

281
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,188
I don't want them
messing with it.

282
00:13:55,194 --> 00:13:57,435
You do it in ten?
Ah, yeah, it's a lot of stuff...

283
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,704
A lot of stuff. What I really
wanted to ask though is, um..

284
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,173
Wait, wait, wait,
what's that behind you?

285
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,541
Oh, yeah,
what you got in there?

286
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,210
Er, it's a storage room.

287
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,846
Storage room?
Can we see what's inside?

288
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,768
- I rather you didn't...
- Oh, but...

289
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,282
- Dude!
- It's a mess!

290
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,984
OK, all right!

291
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,219
Hey!

292
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,455
What the fuck?

293
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,623
<i>Adam?</i>
- Yes?

294
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,305
<i>- Come here...</i>
- Coming.

295
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,367
All right, looking good!

296
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,468
Thank you.

297
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,738
Er, that corn's
a little burnt though...

298
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,306
No, the corn's fine.

299
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,863
- Hey, Will.
- Hey, Rileah.

300
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,713
Why are you filming?

301
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,582
It's a documentary. Adam
told me I had to film dinner.

302
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,554
So, out of everybody
in the world, he picked me.

303
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,257
And you're not afraid that
this guy's some kind of psycho?

304
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,660
No! I mean, not...
Not really...

305
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:57,662
I wanna go on record
as saying that this might be

306
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,430
the worst idea that
you guys have ever come up with.

307
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,566
Er, I think both of us
would agree with that.

308
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,934
What if it was real?

309
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,769
I mean, haven't you
always wished

310
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,691
that something like this
was real?

311
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,709
No! No! Er, unicorns, angels,
I don't know,

312
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,444
hipster ghosts
like Beetlejuice...

313
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,780
- Beetlejuice!
- Yes...

314
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:16,781
- Really?
- Yeah...

315
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,383
You want Beetlejuice to be real!

316
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:22,120
Why would I want
scary monsters to be real?

317
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25,390
'Cause, this guy doesn't
think monsters are scary.

318
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,358
He thinks monsters
are misunderstood.

319
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,294
- Yes! Yes, and...
- Uh-huh?

320
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,857
- And...
- Yeah...

321
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,630
that's what this guy,
Dekker, is all about.

322
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,365
- Right.
- Seriously,

323
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,867
this guy is such a character.

324
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:38,269
When you see the stuff
we've already shot with him,

325
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,511
you're, you're gonna love him.

326
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,073
He's gonna be your new
best friend in the world.

327
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,141
Like you're gonna be friends

328
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,409
with him on Facebook. And...

329
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:45,476
No! No!

330
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:47,145
And, you're gonna
follow him on Twitter!

331
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,079
- No!
- He's gonna be

332
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,147
in your favorites!

333
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,782
No, definitely not.

334
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,150
You're gonna play Xbox with him.

335
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,585
What?

336
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,347
- I mean, basically...
- Ah...

337
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,457
This corn is awful.
You've burnt it, like...

338
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,992
- It's fine...

339
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:01,993
How do you even...

340
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,076
It's fine, just eat it!

341
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,762
The whole thing
could be awesome,

342
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,264
or it could all be bullshit.

343
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,899
- But either way...
- I would say it's not.

344
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,167
We're not gonna know
unless we do it.

345
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,234
You know, even if

346
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,304
the whole story is bullshit,
it's gonna be really funny.

347
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,807
How are you even... OK,
how are you even gonna finish

348
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,009
the next season of your TV show?

349
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,078
I'll figure it out.

350
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,079
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm...

351
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,981
This is just a side project.

352
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,917
And how does Krishna
feel about this?

353
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,686
Erm, ah, er...
She's OK with it.

354
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:29,754
Uh-huh.

355
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,423
She's better than OK with it
because she's a supportive wife!

356
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,659
Please don't get hurt.

357
00:16:34,688 --> 00:16:37,128
I don't wanna have to call your
mom and have to tell her that,

358
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,432
"Adam got, er,
stabbed by some crazy fan

359
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,935
because he decided that he
was gonna go off into the woods

360
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,937
and hang out with him
all night long."

361
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,008
My mom would understand.

362
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,311
- OK. You rolling?
- Yep!

363
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,146
- OK, so...
- I'm rolling.

364
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,181
You know... You know what
I'd really like to do though?

365
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,350
Erm. I mean,
I'm ready to go so

366
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,185
I think it'd be nice
if I got a shot of the car

367
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,954
pulling up and
you guys getting out

368
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,455
and making it
look like a movie.

369
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,457
The car pu...
Why, why do we need the car...

370
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,693
'Cause it's cinematic, it's
gonna look nice, you know...

371
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,228
It's gonna look cinematic!

372
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,829
Come on! Come on!

373
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,798
Please, just get in the car
and go one more time...

374
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,233
Just one more time, please?

375
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,076
Christ!

376
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:32,083
All right, so, how far in
are we actually going here?

377
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,686
There's a cemetery
right up ahead.

378
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:36,754
Uh-huh.

379
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,930
We go about 100 yards
past that...

380
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,911
That's the entrance
to The Marrow.

381
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,462
So nobody minds
that you come out here?

382
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,565
It's a public place!

383
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,002
Right, but the sign
at the entrance

384
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,171
says that the park
closes at dusk.

385
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,441
- So?
- It's a public place!

386
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:02,013
Cause anything off that main
road is closed after sundown.

387
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,181
No I, I understand that,

388
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,016
but we're literally gonna take

389
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,752
some pictures at 'Magic Hour',
you know, like dusk,

390
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,787
and then we're gonna leave
right away, so...

391
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,590
OK, as long as you're
out of here before it gets dark.

392
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,691
Can I ask

393
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:17,095
why it's such a problem
if we're here once it's dark?

394
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,931
'Cause the park closes at dusk.

395
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,899
OK, but like, specifically,

396
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,000
is anything like...

397
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,070
Have you, like, personally,
ever seen anything...

398
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,973
The park closes at dusk!

399
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,943
Argh! OK, I get it now.
Thank you very much.

400
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,945
Has that guy given you
trouble before?

401
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,146
Yeah!

402
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:36,914
Several occasions
he's given me trouble.

403
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,816
Oh, watch out.
Watch your step.

404
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:39,951
OK.

405
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,625
It's right up there.

406
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,393
What is the...

407
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,995
The entrance to The Marrow.

408
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,632
While we're here, you
have to do as I say. All right?

409
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,168
You listen to me
and you do as I say.

410
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,604
I've never brought anyone else
up here before.

411
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:04,108
And it's crucial
that we just observe

412
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,810
and not try to interact.
Come on!

413
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,513
I just, er... I can't...

414
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,281
Do you understand
what I'm trying to say to you?

415
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,450
- I do understand, but I can't...
- You understand, Will?

416
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,152
Understood.
- All right, Come on...

417
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:18,923
You know...

418
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,059
The times
that I've been this close,

419
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:25,329
they've discovered
that I've found out about them

420
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,532
and they've moved on. I don't
want that to happen here.

421
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,601
So just stay with me
and you stay quiet.

422
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,504
What did I tell you to be?
Quiet! You got it, Will?

423
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,672
Got it. Yes, sir.

424
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,008
All right. Come on...

425
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,715
So now what?

426
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,918
Now...

427
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,287
We wait.

428
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:01,299
So how many nights are we...

429
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,967
Do you come out here and like,

430
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:07,171
hang out in creepy cemeteries
by yourself?

431
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,906
I try to come out every night.

432
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,543
Every night, that's a...
That's a lot of nights.

433
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,880
Yeah. Well I don't sleep
all that much so...

434
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,415
Why not?

435
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:22,186
I hear ya. I'm actually, I'm not
much of a sleeper myself.

436
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,655
When we're in production
on the TV show,

437
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:28,292
I'll go, I'll do 20 hour days,
22 hour days...

438
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,695
- Yeah...
- My wife can't stand it.

439
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,430
It's just...
I'm like a zombie.

440
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,600
Hmm. Well, wives are like that.

441
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,370
What's your love life like?

442
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:43,174
You've never mentioned, er, is
there a Mrs. Dekker out there?

443
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,642
Was there?

444
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,079
Er, nope. No Mrs. Dekker.

445
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,184
But there used to be.
A long time ago, but...

446
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,653
So what happened?

447
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,523
Just not work out?

448
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,926
Irreconcilable differences
or...

449
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,895
So what about you, Will?
What's your story, huh? Huh?

450
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:08,065
I'm married. I've been
married sixteen years.

451
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,166
Yeah?

452
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,336
Yeah.
And I have two kids. You know?

453
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,606
- You had kids?
- I have two boys. Yeah.

454
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,208
They're a lot of fun.

455
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,643
How old is Cole now?

456
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,811
Cole's 12.
- Twelve?

457
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,947
Sammy's going to be ten.

458
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,582
- Wow.
- Twelve and ten.

459
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,250
Yeah, they tear my house up.

460
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,820
I envy you.

461
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,723
They're a lot of fun.
I love them

462
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,791
Yeah.

463
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,998
Some nights,

464
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,603
I'll see several
of them coming to and

465
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,705
from that area right there.

466
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,008
Going back and forth
in the woods.

467
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,545
Other nights I'd see
just maybe one.

468
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,948
And a whole bunch of nights

469
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,750
where there's
no activity at all.

470
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:02,253
You just never know, never know
what you're going to get.

471
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,291
Listen, I mean,

472
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,253
if I don't get
any lights out here,

473
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,229
I'm not going to be able
to see anything.

474
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,098
You can't see anything?

475
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,834
Not really. I mean
I can see like three feet

476
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,235
in front of me but that's it.

477
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,705
What about using night vision?

478
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,641
Well...
We could use night vision,

479
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,476
But I think... I hate it.

480
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:28,346
I think it makes everything
just kinda look like green crap.

481
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,548
- OK, I'd rather it look like...

482
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,584
- What?
- Quiet! Turn off that light.

483
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,381
- Silence!
- What?

484
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,022
All right.

485
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,757
Right straight ahead. Look.

486
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,828
Where?

487
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,029
You see, Will?

488
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,365
No, I can't see shit.

489
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,833
Let your eyes
adjust for a second

490
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:49,900
then you'll see it.

491
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,837
It's right there.
Right in front of us.

492
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,171
What? There's nothing.

493
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,907
Look, look. Look, look.

494
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:01,145
One of them just moving very
slowly over to the right. See?

495
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:02,747
Will, turn on the camera light.

496
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,982
No, don't!
Don't you turn on that light!

497
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:08,652
Listen, if I don't turn
the light, I don't have a shot.

498
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,556
OK, he's gone.

499
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,827
Went back down.

500
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,098
He went back down, Will.

501
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,505
<i>Look, look!</i>

502
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,107
<i>One of them</i>
<i>just moving very slowly.</i>

503
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,509
<i>Over the to right, see?</i>

504
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,244
<i>Will, turn on the camera light.</i>

505
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:36,080
<i>No, don't!</i>
<i>Don't you turn on that light!</i>

506
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,083
<i>Listen, if I don't turn</i>
<i>the light, I don't have a shot.</i>

507
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,020
<i>OK, he's gone.</i>

508
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,525
Make a great radio show.

509
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:48,793
Did you raise the brightness?

510
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,294
- Oh, yeah, I raised it.
- All the way?

511
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,929
- All the way.
- This is as bright as it goes?

512
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,230
It's as bright as it goes.
There is nothing...

513
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:54,952
- Do it again.
- All right.

514
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,703
<i>One of them</i>
<i>just moving very slowly.</i>

515
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:00,971
<i>Over the right. See?</i>

516
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,740
<i>Will, turn on the camera light.</i>

517
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,109
<i>No, don't!</i>
<i>Don't you turn on that light.</i>

518
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,644
Awesome.

519
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:08,946
Good work!

520
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,019
I know, tell me about it.

521
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,790
Now this one here I call Vance.

522
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,426
Vance.
- Vance, yes.

523
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,595
You see with the sack
over his head,

524
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:26,230
his face painted on it.

525
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,798
Why Vance?

526
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,306
Because that's
what I want to call him.

527
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,406
Now Vance here, he never
ventured more than a few feet

528
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:37,208
outside the cemetery.

529
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,078
But the several occasions
that I observed him,

530
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,380
I saw him lead some

531
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,051
other rejects
down into The Marrow.

532
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,687
So my guess is old Vance is a...

533
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,424
Well, he is a kind of
a gatekeeper

534
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:57,361
or guardian, you know,
and he guides the new citizens

535
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:58,863
down into their new world,

536
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:01,532
and then he guards against any

537
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,767
interlopers, you know.

538
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,870
Did you...
Did you paint that?

539
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:07,471
- No.
- Because that's really good.

540
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:11,008
I had another artist
do it for me.

541
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,676
I commissioned it.

542
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:16,146
How close is that then
to what you saw, would you say?

543
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,348
It's pretty close, you know.

544
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,436
It's a pretty
good representation.

545
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,720
Umm... I would say probably
on a scale from one to ten,

546
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,955
about eight and a half, nine.

547
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,691
Yeah. So that's, this is Vance.

548
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,127
And why the bag?

549
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,562
Over the head,
do they all do that?

550
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:32,897
- Do they wear costumes?
- No, no...

551
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,365
Well some of them wear masks,

552
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:38,469
others, like Vance, wear a bag.

553
00:25:39,018 --> 00:25:40,738
- Why is that?
- I suppose

554
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,239
Vance wears it because

555
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:45,042
what's underneath
that bag would be a little

556
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,412
too much to take, probably.
You know.

557
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:52,316
I... I've never seen
it under the bag but... er...

558
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,852
I'm sure it's a trip, you know.

559
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:59,023
And then others wear masks
to disguise,

560
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:01,191
perhaps, certain deformities.

561
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:04,328
So they could just be
all around us at any time then,

562
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,430
- is what you're saying.
- Well, not any time... No.

563
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:09,199
Er, there are certain times
of the year

564
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,669
that it's more conducive
for them to be around.

565
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:13,370
For instance, Halloween.

566
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:16,106
One of the few times
they do fit in.

567
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:21,545
Well, I'm hugely
into Halloween myself.

568
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,248
Spiritually,
that's the time of year when

569
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,584
the spiritual world is closest
to our world

570
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,118
and they're around us and...

571
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,720
I don't know...
I don't know anything

572
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:31,121
about the spiritual world.

573
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,389
But it's...
it's kind of like it.

574
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,924
No, it's not at all like it.

575
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,526
This is not a spiritual world.

576
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:36,860
These people are real.

577
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:38,395
They just happen
to be different.

578
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:39,530
- OK?
- Yup.

579
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:41,432
- Sorry.
- Now, this one...

580
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,768
This creature here

581
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,939
is a conjoined creature.
They're like Siamese twins.

582
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,040
They're joined.

583
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,742
Right up in here,

584
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,811
the upper spine and the torso.

585
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,713
And does this one have a name?

586
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:58,949
This one is called,
I call it, the Frog and Huck.

587
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,784
- Frog and Huck?

588
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,986
Frog and Huck, yeah.

589
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,089
And you painted...
The same guy painted this one?

590
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,624
No, no, my son...

591
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,125
I'm sorry?

592
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,427
Wait, wait... you never
mentioned a family before...

593
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:11,750
Err.. you notice a longer body...

594
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,797
No, no. This is really
important, though. I'm curious.

595
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,766
You can't see any eyes
anywhere on their body...

596
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:16,934
You've never mentioned a family.

597
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:18,235
You see it?

598
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,605
I totally see it but I would
love to know... about your son.

599
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:25,175
My guess is that they see
by a kind of audio sensory sight

600
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:28,746
rather like bats,
you know like bat sonar.

601
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:29,748
That kind of thing.

602
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,049
Wait! Wait, wait...
I'm sorry.

603
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:34,852
What is... You hear that?
Are you picking it up?

604
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:36,787
Stay concentrated and focused.
Will you, please?

605
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,255
I'm totally focused.

606
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:41,925
In fact, I really would love
to talk to you

607
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:44,962
a little bit more about
the whole use of lights,

608
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,163
non-use of lights...

609
00:27:46,212 --> 00:27:48,132
That's not up for discussion,
all right?

610
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:51,835
No lights ever.
Lights scare them away.

611
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,772
Do you understand?
I explained that to you before.

612
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:56,540
Lights scare them away.
No lights!

613
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,609
I totally get it.

614
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:00,778
However, though,
I mean, all of these,

615
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,949
these theories, your stories,
photographs, pictures, drawings,

616
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,786
it doesn't...
It's not going to hold up.

617
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,921
Do you not,
do you not believe me?

618
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,990
That's not what I'm asking.

619
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:14,191
Do you believe?

620
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,293
Yes. How about this?

621
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:21,198
I really, really want
to believe. How about that?

622
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,869
Um, I mean... I want to
believe so wicked bad in this...

623
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,037
Yeah.

624
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,407
That's why I'm here
following you and doing...

625
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:34,178
I can tell you my wife thinks
I'm crazy for doing this.

626
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,612
Do you have any children?

627
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,915
Uh...

628
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:41,819
No, not yet. That's not...
It's... it's not really

629
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,387
the priority right now.

630
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:47,091
We've only been married
like three years or so.

631
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,726
That explains a lot.

632
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,997
OK. Um, how about this?

633
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,733
Eventually,

634
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:58,402
we're going to need to have some

635
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,639
monsters in our
monster documentary.

636
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,075
Right?

637
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,547
How's the night vision
working for you?

638
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,615
It's, er...

639
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:14,894
It's pretty good.
I mean I can...

640
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,954
I can see a lot further.

641
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,957
But, I mean it still
looks like an old green.

642
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,159
It's like a sex tape.

643
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,331
Kill it.

644
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,767
Hell...
Shh.

645
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,268
<i>What?</i>

646
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,604
You see those two trees?

647
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,106
What... What trees...
Those two trees

648
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,189
straight ahead from us.

649
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,642
We're in a forest.
There's nothing but...

650
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,364
The big tree on the right?

651
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,333
There's one right behind it.

652
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,818
He's not moving.
But it's there.

653
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,254
- What, uh...
- Don't. Stay still.

654
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:52,890
He might be watching us.
He may have seen us already.

655
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,759
Look, look, you see him moving?

656
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:57,361
- Huh?
- You see him?

657
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,031
- No.
- Yeah.

658
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,667
- Wait, I see something.
- Yeah.

659
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:06,036
It kind of looks
like a tree branch.

660
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,644
OK, dude, do you see anything?

661
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,214
Oh, God!

662
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:19,368
He's right here
in front of us now!

663
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
I... I don't see anything.
Turn, turn it on. The light.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Will, turn it on!
If it's here, I wanna see it.
- Turn off that light!
- Turn on the light!

664
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,693
Shut it off! Shut it off!

665
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,863
Right.

666
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,335
What the hell was that?

667
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:39,703
We're done.

668
00:30:39,912 --> 00:30:41,672
What do you mean done?
We just saw something.

669
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:42,573
We're done!

670
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:44,541
We're done!

671
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,980
<i>All right. So, er,</i>
<i>camera's rolling,</i>

672
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,862
<i>tell me about</i>
<i>what we saw today.</i>

673
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:56,787
Well, basically, my boy,
Dekker, finally delivered

674
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,756
and we got a...

675
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:04,795
what I can only think
is a monster on camera.

676
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:07,564
And it's undeniable.
It was there.

677
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,167
We have the footage, and

678
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,036
I am... psyched,
because this is...

679
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,104
All right,

680
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,540
I will be totally honest,
for a brief moment

681
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,542
I was starting to think
the guy is completely crazy

682
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:19,710
and we've wasted our time,

683
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:22,179
which still could have been
funny for something,

684
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:25,649
but, but we saw it, and
it was real and it was awesome.

685
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:27,150
Don't you, er...

686
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,752
Don't you think
it's a little scary, though?

687
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,520
Why scary?

688
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,089
Why are you going
to be such a pussy?

689
00:31:32,318 --> 00:31:34,758
It's not scary. Just because
something doesn't look like us,

690
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,062
or look like everybody else,
doesn't mean it's scary.

691
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:43,433
In my whole life, I've only
wanted to see a real monster.

692
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,369
You know, when I was little,
I'd look under my bed,

693
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:47,504
I'd look in the closet,
not 'cause I was afraid

694
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,407
because I wanted it to be real,
you know.

695
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:54,745
I mean, it's just, you know,
think about Victor Crowley.

696
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:55,979
You know what?

697
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,180
Victor Crowley
actually kills people.

698
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,752
Victor Crowley is not real.

699
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,957
<i>Turn, turn, turn it on.</i>
<i>Turn the light.</i>

700
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,425
<i>- No, no, no, no, no.</i>
<i>- Will, turn it on!</i>

701
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,526
<i>If it's here, I wanna see it.</i>

702
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:11,595
<i>- Turn off that light!</i>
<i>- Turn on the light!</i>

703
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:13,964
Stop it, stop it.

704
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:18,302
If that's a make-up job,
it's a damn good make-up job.

705
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:19,603
That's all I'm saying, right?

706
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,305
Well...

707
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:22,906
- Right?
- I'm just going off the footage.

708
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,608
Because I wasn't there.

709
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,643
But my gut is telling me that
you guys are messing with me.

710
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,412
We're not messing with you.

711
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,414
I tell your gut to shut up.
How about that?

712
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,149
You believe this.
You're a believer.

713
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:33,550
You believe in William Dekker.

714
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:34,952
Yes, well, OK...
how about this.

715
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:38,722
I don't necessarily believe him
but I believe this, yes.

716
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:40,324
I've always wanted
to believe this.

717
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:41,625
Haven't you always wanted...

718
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,795
Look at you... you have
a whole sleeve of horror stuff

719
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,330
and you're not more excited
by this?

720
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,498
Haven't you always
wanted this to be real?

721
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,368
I mean, I don't know about this,
like aliens maybe.

722
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,004
Aliens, aliens,
who cares about aliens?

723
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:57,074
This is monsters...
this is monsters. What if...

724
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,676
What if this guy's conspiracy
theories are all true,

725
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,144
right, and he came to us
with this

726
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,412
and we're the ones
who are getting it.

727
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Right, then maybe
we'll make some
of our money back
for filming this.
It's always money with you.
Why is it always about money?
I was just saying...
Whoa!

728
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,421
Oh, that's Kane.

729
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:12,689
Hey!
- Hey, boys.

730
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:13,824
- How are you?
- Hi, Kane.

731
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,325
- Good.
- Thank you for coming over.

732
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,526
What's with the camera?

733
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:17,928
- Err... we're just...
- It's part of a thing.

734
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,643
Yeah, we're just doing
a thing...

735
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,031
Thank you for coming so late.

736
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,332
- Sure.
- First, first you have

737
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,200
- to see this, OK?
- All right.

738
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:24,167
What are you showing me?

739
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,137
Wait, wait. We've been shooting
this documentary, OK?

740
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,272
- This guy contacted me.
- Documentary?

741
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,341
Yes, it's a documentary and...

742
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,376
Very fancy.

743
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:33,677
If you think that's fancy,

744
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,879
you should see all the make-up
he had on in the interviews.

745
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:38,648
I did... It's a formal
sit-down interview.

746
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,183
You have some make-up on.

747
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,818
OK, will you just
play this for us?

748
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,720
Just watch this, watch this,
watch this.

749
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:44,888
Play the tape.

750
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,590
<i>I... I don't see anything.</i>

751
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,765
<i>Turn, turn, turn it on.</i>
<i>Turn the light.</i>

752
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,060
<i>- No, no, no, no, no.</i>
<i>- Will, turn it on!</i>

753
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:50,894
<i>If it's here, I wanna see it.</i>

754
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:53,196
<i>- Turn off that light!</i>
<i>- Turn on the light!</i>

755
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:55,732
<i>Shut it off...</i>

756
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,969
So what am I looking at?

757
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:00,871
What are you look at?
The monster,

758
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:01,872
did you not just see that?

759
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,240
No, I mean what's it for?

760
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:06,276
It's not for anything, it's...

761
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:08,979
Play it again, play it again.
Watch closely.

762
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:11,148
Look at this. Really look at it.
Go, go, go.

763
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,064
- Turn<i> off that light!</i>
<i>- Turn on the light!</i>

764
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,988
<i>Shut it off...</i>

765
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,558
It does look pretty cool,

766
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,160
but you can't really
see it that well.

767
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,861
- Well, it's the...
- Who made it?

768
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:27,197
Nobody made it.
That's the whole point.

769
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,266
- It's real.
- We actually shot this

770
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,068
in a cemetery up in Chatsworth.

771
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,503
- Yes.
- And it wasn't porn?

772
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,274
Chatsworth is the mecca of porn.

773
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:38,508
I know that, yes...

774
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,243
I'd like to see that part again.

775
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,779
There's no more than this.

776
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:46,416
I give... if anybody should
be excited by this, it's you.

777
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,285
If anyone knows monsters,
it's you.

778
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:51,188
Look at that, look at the neck.
The thin neck, the huge head,

779
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,290
how could you even do that
as an appliance on somebody?

780
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,692
- Want my real opinion?
- Yes.

781
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,935
- It looks really good.
- Thank you.

782
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,396
I mean, no, not thank you

783
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,231
because it's not...
We didn't do it.

784
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:04,201
It looks really good but it's...
you need to light it better,

785
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:06,369
- it's terrible, Will.
- Oh, come on!

786
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,972
It wasn't lit.
That's the whole point.

787
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:12,442
- Yes, it's exactly right.
- No, it's actual footage.

788
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,645
Actual footage. Found footage.

789
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,781
Boy, that hasn't been done
before.

790
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,250
- No, no, no, no.
- That's what I was trying...

791
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:21,651
Will you shut up?

792
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:27,224
No, it's not found footage.
It's footage footage.

793
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:29,459
- Damn!
- No, it's...

794
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,428
I'm so let down right now.

795
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,263
Well, what else you got
to look at, then?

796
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:36,399
We have tons, we have so much.

797
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:38,668
We've actually got nothing else.

798
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,541
<i>What you did...</i>

799
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,650
<i>could have destroyed</i>
<i>decades of work.</i>

800
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:52,816
Have you been back
to our spot since? OK, and...

801
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:56,520
Yes, I have and thank God
they haven't gone yet.

802
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:58,763
But they're moving around
with a lot more caution.

803
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:00,991
They probably chalked up
our little incident

804
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:03,927
to a random sighting and they
don't fear for their discovery

805
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,097
or that their entrance is
in jeopardy in any way.

806
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:11,101
OK, all right, but... Um,
I totally hear.

807
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,370
I want this to work so badly.

808
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:16,506
I really do.
But, by the same token,

809
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:20,277
you brought us into this
to shoot stuff.

810
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:24,214
OK? And if we can't shoot stuff,

811
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:28,018
then there's no story, right?
There's nothing.

812
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,620
So, help me here.

813
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,022
Yeah, yeah..

814
00:36:32,617 --> 00:36:34,858
Well, that's why I've brought
you over here today.

815
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,027
Is there any way
that we can shoot

816
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,663
and not be
so completely intrusive?

817
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:41,364
Yes, er...

818
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:45,035
Will and I have been talking
about that a lot.

819
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:51,575
Err... Will, why don't you tell
Mr. Dekker our plan?

820
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,310
- Good.
- Me?

821
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:54,978
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Do it.</i>

822
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,247
Um, OK. Well, er...
Here's what we talked about.

823
00:36:57,249 --> 00:37:01,751
Um, so we set up
a fake street light,

824
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,153
if you will, out there.

825
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,156
A light that's just, maybe
could play for a street light.

826
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:07,557
We turn it on during the day.

827
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,161
We do all this during the day,
so no one is disturbed.

828
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:12,529
We set up
a street light out there,

829
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:13,997
turn it on and leave it on.

830
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,399
This is on.
- On all the time.

831
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,736
Then we take some small cameras

832
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,171
and we rig them to the trees.

833
00:37:21,173 --> 00:37:22,839
We have a few cameras
in the office...

834
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,441
They're so small like
you wouldn't even...

835
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,176
- They're real tiny cameras.
- So small.

836
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:28,578
And we rig them to the trees
and just let them roll.

837
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,347
Let them roll.
Nobody goes out there,

838
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,848
starts and stops them. Nothing.

839
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,216
No lights on the cameras?

840
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:34,784
Nope, there's no lights
on the cameras.

841
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,053
How bright is that light
that you already have on?

842
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,188
- It's not...
- It's not...

843
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,223
It's not bright. It's soft.

844
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:43,627
Yeah, on a scale
of one to ten, it's really soft.

845
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:46,062
And nobody turns it on.
It's already on.

846
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,365
Nobody is going
to disturb anybody

847
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,899
With this,
with what we want to do.

848
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,835
- No.
- No.

849
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:13,056
- OK. So... We got...
- Shh!

850
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,760
- We got five cameras now.
- Yeah.

851
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,762
Pointing here for now,

852
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,964
they're pointed there,
at the cemetery,

853
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,732
and, if you look up there,

854
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:25,602
we'll hang that street light
looking thing.

855
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,671
It looks almost identical
to the ones

856
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:29,906
they have hanging
in the front of this place,

857
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:33,076
so completely unobtrusive,
but now we have light.

858
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:34,644
Now we can see things.

859
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,980
If that cemetery light
makes them suspicious?

860
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,317
It won't. Honestly,
I'd be more worried

861
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,086
making that Park Ranger
dude suspicious,

862
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:44,688
but hopefully,
he thinks that, you know,

863
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:48,024
like maintenance came out
and replaced it or something.

864
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:49,092
I don't know.

865
00:38:49,174 --> 00:38:51,294
But I'm... honestly,
I am kind of surprised

866
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,029
that you haven't thought
of this before.

867
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:55,632
I have.
It didn't work.

868
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,270
Fantastic.

869
00:39:08,887 --> 00:39:10,847
Actually, I think
it would be better

870
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,282
if we didn't have the music

871
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:14,617
while we're actually
recording the interview

872
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:18,121
because the music
makes it hard to edit with.

873
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,557
It's my favorite tune.

874
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,393
Who, who is this?

875
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,362
I don't know.

876
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,503
During my decades of research,
I've...

877
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:37,440
I have discovered
over 40 different species

878
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,143
going to and from The Marrow,

879
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,179
and that's just
from the half dozen or so

880
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:45,148
entrances that I have found.

881
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,983
- Half dozen or so...
Uh-huh.

882
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,820
Now are they always out
in the woods or

883
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:52,822
near a creepy cemetery?

884
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:54,991
Sometimes in the woods,
sometimes in the cemetery

885
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,960
and sometimes in other places.

886
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,664
The eye hop.

887
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,001
Eye hop?

888
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:12,242
Um, why would they have
a Marrow entrance

889
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:13,543
where there's an eye hop?

890
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:14,978
They like pancakes.

891
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,581
Pancakes?

892
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,518
Everybody loves pancakes.

893
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:28,191
Pancakes.

894
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,193
Of course.

895
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:40,403
Anyway, that one er,
entrance in Arizona

896
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:42,772
I couldn't really identify.

897
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:46,142
I mean I monitored the situation
for several months

898
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:48,778
but I couldn't pinpoint
where the entrance was.

899
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:53,716
However, the entrance here,
in Southern California,

900
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:56,553
is the most defined entrance
I've ever seen.

901
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:58,154
I don't want to lose it.

902
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,256
Because if you give them
enough reason down there

903
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,158
to suspect
that they've been discovered,

904
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,493
then they'll just move on.

905
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:04,894
I don't know
if they move underground

906
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,816
from one metropolis
to another but

907
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,666
you'll find the entrance sealed

908
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:11,468
like there was
nothing ever there.

909
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,703
And I would like to think that

910
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,506
the metropolises underneath

911
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:18,608
are connected in some way,
you know.

912
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,743
Like all the different areas
as...

913
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:23,980
'Cause I mean I'm looking
at that map and this...

914
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,315
It's all over the country.

915
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:29,586
And so you feel that they're
all connected underground?

916
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:31,020
I think that's quite possible.

917
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:33,256
Yes, but I don't have
any hard evidence,

918
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:36,092
of course,
to substantiate that, so...

919
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,930
Most of the subjects
are painfully shy.

920
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,300
Painfully shy.

921
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,636
In fact, one that I had observed
in Salem, Massachusetts,

922
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:48,605
that I called Brella...

923
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:49,672
Brella?

924
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,674
Brella, short for umbrella.

925
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,177
There she is, right there.

926
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,715
You notice here the umbrella
covers up her head entirely,

927
00:41:58,717 --> 00:42:00,550
- as you can't see her face.
- Yup.

928
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:05,021
But she does have the body
of a normal human female,

929
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:08,024
and a very attractive one
I might say, you know.

930
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,279
In fact, I saw her
interacting with a human.

931
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,062
Interacting, how?

932
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,399
Like a human saw... saw that?

933
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,934
I saw Brella

934
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,537
in Salem, Massachusetts,

935
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,074
pick up a drunk college boy
outside of a bar.

936
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,243
- Wait... Do you mean?
- In an alley...

937
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:30,680
Pick up like 'flirted with',

938
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:34,484
like 'took him home', like...
What do you mean by picked up?

939
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:35,952
What does 'pick up' mean to you?

940
00:42:36,094 --> 00:42:38,054
Well, that's... That's what
it means but I have...

941
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,222
Well, then, that's what I mean.

942
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,323
OK, but I would imagine...

943
00:42:40,325 --> 00:42:43,560
She picked him up for some
sort of sexual escapade, OK?

944
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,662
OK, now if I got picked up...

945
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:47,030
They walked away,
they disappeared,

946
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:48,498
I tried to follow them...

947
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,533
Why wouldn't he say something
to somebody though if he...

948
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,936
Why... Why...
What is wrong with you?

949
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:55,572
Why can't I ever just tell you
something and you listen?

950
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:56,814
'Cause I wanna cut through it.

951
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,675
I mean, again,
it's another painting.

952
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:00,343
You don't have a picture,
you don't photograph.

953
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:01,611
Now you're telling me
somebody...

954
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:03,079
I'm telling you what she did.

955
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,215
She picked up this drunk college
boy. She went off with him.

956
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,377
I don't know what happened.

957
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,511
I tried to follow them,
I lost them.

958
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,987
That's it.

959
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:13,623
So then, then what?

960
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:14,857
What happened?

961
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:16,859
Then... after about three weeks,

962
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:19,963
a body washed up by a river
in Danvers...

963
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,865
Oh. The body of the boy?

964
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:24,601
Well...

965
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:25,868
Nobody really knew...

966
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,973
I mean, there wasn't much there
to be able to identify.

967
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:34,243
<i>All his entire jaw was gone</i>
<i>And no dentition...</i>

968
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:36,312
<i>The hands were gone,</i>
<i>the feet were gone.</i>

969
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,147
Just a lump of flesh...

970
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,316
Not very identifiable.

971
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,085
Now the case is still open,
you know,

972
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:43,820
it's unsolved but,

973
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:48,057
I bet my pants it was that boy.

974
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:51,628
In every society,

975
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,565
there are other deviants.

976
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,335
The bad seeds, you know.

977
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,473
The ones who are pure evil.

978
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,709
You're saying

979
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,145
that

980
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,681
something from The Marrow

981
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,917
killed somebody
and these things are dangerous.

982
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,186
Not all of them.

983
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:19,188
But some of them.

984
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,025
Perhaps.

985
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,698
Er... I think we're good.

986
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,600
For today. Can we stop?

987
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:31,841
- Yes.
<i>- Yeah, it's a cut.</i>

988
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,406
Forget the fact this guy
is just a complete psycho

989
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,007
which is a given.

990
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:41,110
But now he's showing us these
like images of these things

991
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,646
that may or may not exist,
right?

992
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:45,882
And now he's says
they're killing people.

993
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:48,051
I don't understand
what we're doing.

994
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:50,987
Yeah, I mean you...
you were there. You saw it.

995
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:52,822
You can't deny what we saw.

996
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:55,558
Well, I mean I can't say
that I saw a real monster.

997
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,126
Look at the movies we've done,
right.

998
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,294
Like think about that.

999
00:44:58,536 --> 00:45:00,496
All the make-up effects
that we put on the screen,

1000
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:01,597
the visual effects...

1001
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,900
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
After all the movies we've done,

1002
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:07,170
you mean to tell me that
you can't tell the difference

1003
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:10,973
between full latex or silicon
and what we actually saw

1004
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,041
right in front of us.

1005
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:15,712
I'm just saying it's possible,
you know. That's all.

1006
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,315
It's possible what?
That there's monsters?

1007
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:21,250
No! That this guy's
a total freakazoid!

1008
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:22,318
Guys...

1009
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,153
Listen... I mean...

1010
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:28,091
I'm not actually working
on this whole monster project,

1011
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:31,728
but what I am working on is
a little show called<i> Holliston.</i>

1012
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:36,232
Um, I am a little concerned,
Adam, do you have any scripts?

1013
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,402
They're almost ready... I uh...
they're gonna be done...

1014
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:41,104
But we start production
in like two months.

1015
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:42,572
And I will get it done.

1016
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,575
I don't want to just, you know,
I don't want to say

1017
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:48,010
"'Stop what you're doing
and write<i> Holliston"</i>

1018
00:45:48,752 --> 00:45:50,913
but I really need you to stop
what you're doing

1019
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,381
and write<i> Holliston.</i>

1020
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:55,118
OK. If...
I swear to God,

1021
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,220
if you had been there
and you saw this,

1022
00:45:57,222 --> 00:45:59,055
you'd be just as fire up
as we are

1023
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:01,924
and you would be like, "OK,
the other stuff can wait."

1024
00:46:01,973 --> 00:46:03,893
And you don't think
it's dangerous.

1025
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:05,194
You don't think
you could get hurt.

1026
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,530
Listen, it was fun
when it started.

1027
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:08,631
You know running
around the woods

1028
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:09,932
chasing the psycho guy around.

1029
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,634
It was fun. But now,

1030
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:14,103
Sarah's telling us
we're putting the show on hold,

1031
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,973
which means we're putting
our careers on hold,

1032
00:46:17,128 --> 00:46:19,208
and, I mean,
I talked to Krishna about it.

1033
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,144
She's not really happy
about this whole thing.

1034
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:23,980
Oh, no.
You know, not to be a dick

1035
00:46:23,982 --> 00:46:27,583
but I don't care
what your wife thinks.

1036
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:30,319
Why doesn't she write
the next season of the show?

1037
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,622
- It'll probably be better.
- Adam, stop. Stop it.

1038
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:37,059
All I am saying is that
an amazing opportunity

1039
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:39,128
just dropped right into our laps

1040
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,664
and now you're saying
you want to quit.

1041
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,966
No, no, no no. I'm not saying
that I want to quit.

1042
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:46,669
I'm just saying that we need
to control it better.

1043
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:48,504
We need to get done
what we need to get done.

1044
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:49,839
Not quit.

1045
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,909
Adam, like honestly,

1046
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:54,977
do you 100 percent
believe this guy

1047
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,379
and his whole monster thing?

1048
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:58,514
I...

1049
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,485
Ninety percent.
I 90 percent believe.

1050
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:08,224
Well, 90 percent.
That's a lot of percent.

1051
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,662
All right, that's number five...

1052
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,799
Uh, wait... I'm sorry.
Could you please wait?

1053
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:19,302
Because we need to shoot you
when you analyze the footage.

1054
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:21,637
So just wait till we get back,
please.

1055
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:24,440
So, you're sure that camera two
is in this tree?

1056
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:26,108
Yeah, I'm sure.

1057
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:30,179
And we have one, three,
four and five.

1058
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,181
<i>Definitely, two.</i>

1059
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,951
Uh, maybe it fell out?

1060
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,019
No.

1061
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:43,426
Uh, what about you, Mr. Dekker?
See anything over there?

1062
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,696
No, I don't see a thing.
Nothing.

1063
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,768
Well,
looks like we lost camera two.

1064
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,070
Come on.

1065
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:55,471
We got to get out of here.

1066
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,908
I will pay you back.

1067
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:03,713
<i>I got something.</i>

1068
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:05,694
- Huh?
- Adam, come here.

1069
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,017
Now look, look!

1070
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:10,086
Will... Come here, come here,
come here!

1071
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:13,189
- Oh, look.
- Dude, dude!

1072
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:16,826
Come here, come here, come here!
See... didn't I tell you?

1073
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:20,496
<i>That is awesome.</i>

1074
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:22,231
I've never seen one
like that before.

1075
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,733
- Really?
- No...

1076
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:25,501
<i>New species.</i>

1077
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,638
You want to name it?

1078
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,706
Me? No!

1079
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,909
You do it.
It's... That's your thing.

1080
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:34,543
All right, all right.

1081
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:36,505
I'm gonna call them
Little Big Foot.

1082
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,348
Little, Little Big Foot, really?

1083
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,310
He looks like a Big Foot,
doesn't he?

1084
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,921
Yeah, I mean if Big Foot
was a real thing

1085
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:47,523
and if anyone had seen it.

1086
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:49,726
What about, what about
something more original?

1087
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:52,295
You know what about, um,
Deringer.

1088
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:53,696
So you wanna name it?

1089
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:54,864
No...
You... You...

1090
00:48:54,866 --> 00:48:56,198
All right, then.

1091
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,769
Little Big Foot.
New species.

1092
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:03,940
<i>You don't like Deringer?</i>

1093
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,544
<i>OK, stop it, stop it.</i>

1094
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:12,615
OK, so that was,
what, four hours.

1095
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:15,651
- Four hours
- Four hours, and then,

1096
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:17,853
whatever that thing is,

1097
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,656
crawls out of the hole
and walks away.

1098
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,627
So you honestly want
to try tell me that Dekker

1099
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:29,231
had some dude just wait
underground for four hours

1100
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,394
only to get up and walk away
for our cameras.

1101
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:34,971
You got me. You got me.

1102
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:36,072
Ha!

1103
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,643
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

1104
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:44,080
We've now cut our second monster

1105
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,182
on camera, and

1106
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,584
Mr. Dekker seems
to think that it's a

1107
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,821
new kind of species
which is all kind of...

1108
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,322
- Stay.
- What?

1109
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,757
Come to bed.

1110
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:56,325
I'm going to in a second.
I just...

1111
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,694
I have to do my recording
about the second monster

1112
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,656
or else it's going
to drive me nuts.

1113
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:04,934
Then I'll be talking about
monsters all night.

1114
00:50:04,936 --> 00:50:06,369
You're cute.

1115
00:50:07,105 --> 00:50:09,105
Seriously, though,
you need to sleep.

1116
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:10,606
I'm going to.

1117
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,278
In three, two, one...

1118
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:50,746
<i>So look at that...</i>

1119
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,549
I mean the teeth, the eye...
it's amazing, right?

1120
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,684
Yeah, very nice.
Who does your creature work?

1121
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:57,987
OK, that's the best part.

1122
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:03,025
Nobody. It's real. This
is real footage that we got.

1123
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:04,460
<i>There was this guy who...</i>

1124
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,195
<i>he wrote me a letter</i>
<i>through my fan mail</i>

1125
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:08,531
and he had this whole theory
that, like,

1126
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:11,233
you know when people
were born deformed or whatever,

1127
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:12,475
like where do they go?
You know,

1128
00:51:12,562 --> 00:51:14,403
you don't just see
them walking around, I mean,

1129
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,525
unless you had a horror
convention like this.

1130
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:18,240
<i>But, it's, you know...</i>

1131
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,743
<i>he says that they've all</i>
<i>retreated underground</i>

1132
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:21,677
and that's where they live.

1133
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:25,047
So, we've been making this
documentary following him...

1134
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:26,315
Whoa... Hold it.

1135
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,051
You're reminding me
of the psycho of a guy,

1136
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:32,354
he has a name like Davis Darren?

1137
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:35,791
- Dekker?
- That's it.

1138
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:38,694
Er, Mick, Mick, would you come
over here for a second?

1139
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:40,296
Adam,

1140
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:43,399
Hey, Mick, how are you?
Good to see you.

1141
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:46,969
Adam is working with Dekker,
the monster hunter.

1142
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:48,204
Oh, no.

1143
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,106
No, I'm not. I wouldn't say
I'm working with him.

1144
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:51,440
You? He's harassing you, now?

1145
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,276
Well, no. We... I talked
to him once about something.

1146
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:57,746
"I found The Marrow."
That guy? Please.

1147
00:51:57,748 --> 00:52:00,382
He's been after me,
and Tom, and Carpenter

1148
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:02,017
and Guillermo, Landis...

1149
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,787
Every horror director in the
business he's been bothering.

1150
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:07,923
He's antagonized everybody
for years.

1151
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:10,326
Trying to get us
to buy the movie rights

1152
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:11,894
to his stupid story.

1153
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:13,996
He's a real basket case.

1154
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:18,134
Err... Yeah. No.
Totally, I just...

1155
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:22,238
Grasshopper here
has been working with him,

1156
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,339
I can tell...

1157
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:24,940
No, no, I wouldn't say
"working with him".

1158
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:26,275
- What are you, stupid?
- No!

1159
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:28,911
I'm sorry, that was rude.

1160
00:52:28,913 --> 00:52:31,614
- But are you?
- Uh, I guess sort of, I guess...

1161
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:33,582
Anyway, your creature work
is great

1162
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:35,151
regardless of who's doing it.

1163
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:38,687
- How's your next movie coming?
- Uh, which one?

1164
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:41,924
I don't know. It's what you say.
I'm trying to be nice.

1165
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:44,260
Good luck, guy. Good luck.

1166
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:46,295
Have a good signing.
And whatever you're shooting,

1167
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:48,030
I'm not signing the release.

1168
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:49,365
Thank you.

1169
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,535
All right, so, er...

1170
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:54,036
Are we going to talk about it?

1171
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,674
He said, right up front,
that he's tried

1172
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,976
numerous ways to get
this story out there.

1173
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:02,378
OK? So...

1174
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,814
Yeah, it was embarrassing
that I didn't know

1175
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:07,449
that he had already been
to everybody else.

1176
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:09,852
OK, like what am I...
Is that what you want?

1177
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,687
Is that what you want me to say,
"I am embarrassed"?

1178
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,455
- that I feel stupid?
- No.

1179
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,992
But, look, when we get back,
the next time we talk to him,

1180
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:18,394
I'll ask him, point blank,

1181
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,462
who else have you
brought this story to?

1182
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,766
And, you know,
let's see what he says.

1183
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,534
Yeah, we'll see.

1184
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,003
You think he's going to be
truthful about that?

1185
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,148
So, one thing that
I've been meaning to ask you

1186
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:45,154
is why reach out to
a genre filmmaker with this?

1187
00:53:45,156 --> 00:53:48,190
Why go to somebody like me
who does what I do?

1188
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:51,327
Well, heck, I tried the
authorities, I tried the press,

1189
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:53,329
I was even
on a couple of talk shows.

1190
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,930
Nobody wanted to hear it.

1191
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:59,468
They all treat me like
I was a nut, you know?

1192
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,137
So, I thought, you know,

1193
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,074
a filmmaker who had
a built-in audience...

1194
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:09,345
and who can capture
and tell the story...

1195
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,348
convincingly and properly...

1196
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:16,418
Properly. That would be
the way to go, you know?

1197
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,756
OK, then why not got
to somebody bigger,

1198
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:24,627
like an even more established,
you know, why... Why me?

1199
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,163
You work outside the machine.
I like that.

1200
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,803
So, you never reached out
to somebody else before me?

1201
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:37,072
Never went to anybody,
that is was straight to me?

1202
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:38,907
Nope. Just you.

1203
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:40,042
Just me.

1204
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:42,311
<i>So, there were a couple of</i>

1205
00:54:42,313 --> 00:54:44,647
<i>interesting things that happened</i>
<i>when you guys were gone.</i>

1206
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:46,569
I think
you're going to like this.

1207
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,770
<i>So, it'll start on</i>
<i>camera four here.</i>

1208
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,953
<i>We're looking right at The</i>
<i>Marrow and here comes Dekker,</i>

1209
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,188
<i>1:30 in the morning</i>
<i>with a bag and flashlight.</i>

1210
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:55,891
All right.

1211
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,560
This is where it
gets really weird.

1212
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,796
<i>He walks over to camera three...</i>

1213
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,299
<i>looks right at it...</i>

1214
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,635
<i>and turns it off.</i>

1215
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,706
Why would he shut...?

1216
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,509
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Goes over to camera one.</i>

1217
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,312
Again, right at it...

1218
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,480
<i>- And he shut...</i>
<i>- Turns it off.</i>

1219
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:21,459
All right, what I
want to know though is

1220
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,218
if he shuts off all the cameras,
like what is he not...

1221
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,088
Does he think we're not
gonna see that in the footage?

1222
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,724
He doesn't turn off camera four.

1223
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:31,860
<i>So he either doesn't know</i>
<i>how to work the cameras,</i>

1224
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:33,495
<i>he doesn't know how many</i>
<i>are up there...</i>

1225
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,763
<i>whatever.</i>

1226
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,532
<i>He's back at the hole</i>

1227
00:55:36,534 --> 00:55:38,534
<i>signaling something,</i>
<i>it looks like...</i>

1228
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:41,704
and if we get in close,
he starts pulling something

1229
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:44,440
<i>out of the bag, and I</i>
<i>don't know what's in the bag.</i>

1230
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:45,774
<i>Maybe you guys can help me out.</i>

1231
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:47,009
<i>What is that?</i>

1232
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,378
<i>Just an old man talking</i>
<i>to a hole in the ground.</i>

1233
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,213
No, well, what's in his hand?

1234
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,116
- I know what that is...
- What?

1235
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:55,851
It's a... it's a spoon.

1236
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,554
<i>So, what is he doing?</i>
<i>He's taking dirt?</i>

1237
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:00,516
<i>Was he taking samples</i>
<i>out of the...?</i>

1238
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,692
<i>I mean, he's like...</i>
<i>he's digging down there.</i>

1239
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,029
And then he puts it in his bag?

1240
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,299
No, no, no, he's taking
something out of...

1241
00:56:10,301 --> 00:56:12,634
<i>What's he feeding,</i>
<i>feeding one of them?</i>

1242
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:16,338
<i>I can't see... I can't see in.</i>

1243
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,706
<i>There's no definition.</i>

1244
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,875
<i>Such low light sensors that...</i>

1245
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,610
<i>He's feeding something...</i>

1246
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:24,113
<i>or he thinks</i>
<i>he's feeding something.</i>

1247
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,017
OK, then, what else?
What else?

1248
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,687
I mean, after that,
fast forward a little bit,

1249
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:34,690
he packs up his stuff,
stands up...

1250
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:35,824
Uh huh.

1251
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,093
<i>Walks back over...</i>

1252
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:39,528
<i>Turns the cameras on again.</i>

1253
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,497
<i>Yup, camera one comes on.</i>

1254
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,999
<i>Sets it up, clear as day...</i>

1255
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,868
<i>He has to know</i>
<i>we're going to see that.</i>

1256
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:48,103
<i>So, is this...</i>
<i>Here's a question,</i>

1257
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:51,006
<i>Is this on purpose?</i>
<i>Did he want us to see that?</i>

1258
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,108
<i>'Cause I'm...</i>

1259
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:58,213
I'm kind of... and then
he's waving and signaling again.

1260
00:56:58,215 --> 00:57:00,482
<i>OK, awesome.</i>
<i>What else? Anything else?</i>

1261
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:04,853
This one is a little weird.
Um, the very next night,

1262
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,048
- Mm-hm.
- Four o'clock in the morning,

1263
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,025
<i>- camera one...</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

1264
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,760
<i>I'll zoom in so you can see.</i>

1265
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:14,222
Here he is sitting
on the edge of The Marrow.

1266
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:20,035
<i>He's like...</i>

1267
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,150
<i>And I have no idea</i>
<i>what he's doing</i>

1268
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,785
<i>but he's sitting here for about</i>
<i>a minute and a half, 2 minutes.</i>

1269
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:28,777
He's touching something
in there.

1270
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,880
<i>What, is he petting one of them?</i>

1271
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:35,951
<i>I don't think is petting them.</i>

1272
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,321
What is it?
<i>Oh my God, wait...</i>

1273
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,391
<i>He's crying.</i>

1274
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,294
<i>He's crying.</i>

1275
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,300
I didn't know
what to make of it.

1276
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:52,501
He's like sobbing.

1277
00:57:54,444 --> 00:57:56,605
<i>I mean, the only other</i>
<i>thing I'm doing is catching up</i>

1278
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:59,641
on cemetery footage,
just hours of cemetery footage.

1279
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:07,249
This guy, it's like he's sick.

1280
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:11,386
You know, like, he chooses the
weirdest things to lie about.

1281
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,522
Isn't the lying just enough

1282
00:58:13,524 --> 00:58:14,957
to stop this whole thing?

1283
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:16,158
No, it's not.

1284
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,193
Why do you have to keep saying
that we need to stop it?

1285
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,828
It's not enough. I don't care
about him lying to me.

1286
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:20,996
That's irrelevant.

1287
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:22,498
Did you tell Josh about
the other night?

1288
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,800
- What happened the other night?
- Nothing happened the other...

1289
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:25,868
It turns out that
this Dekker guy

1290
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,002
has gone to every single

1291
00:58:27,149 --> 00:58:28,470
Hollywood director
with the story.

1292
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:29,938
Who else did he go to?

1293
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,374
It doesn't matter.
It... That's semantics.

1294
00:58:32,376 --> 00:58:35,677
What matters isn't him,
OK, it's 'it'.

1295
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,679
It's where he can
take us because...

1296
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,781
And I know I sound crazy
to everybody

1297
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:42,017
but my whole life
since I was a little kid

1298
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,986
I had prayed for this
to happen to me.

1299
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:45,787
I have prayed for this
to be real,

1300
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:50,058
and now I have seen it...
and for better or for worse,

1301
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:53,629
this lunatic is the guy
who can bring me to it.

1302
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:55,531
And, OK,

1303
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,778
I know you guys
are going to say I'm trying

1304
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:00,903
I swear to God I'm not but this
is just the theory I have.

1305
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:03,472
I think that this is
some sort of psychosis,

1306
00:59:03,474 --> 00:59:04,606
like this whole thing.

1307
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:08,043
I think that, like,
his kid died or something.

1308
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,311
And this is why...

1309
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,547
When we were in the cemetery
and you mentioned your kids,

1310
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:13,215
he was all over you
about your kids, right?

1311
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,483
That's right.

1312
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:16,652
And then when we were doing one
of our interviews with him

1313
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:19,655
he was showing me paintings
of the monsters.

1314
00:59:19,657 --> 00:59:22,424
And I asked him about them,
"Oh, who painted that?"

1315
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:24,993
- And he said, uh...
- He said my son.

1316
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:26,595
Thank you. Yes.

1317
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:28,597
- And then, when I try...
- "Oh wait, son?"

1318
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:31,033
"Oh no", he
didn't want to go there anymore.

1319
00:59:31,035 --> 00:59:33,602
Now he's feeding something
in a hole,

1320
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:35,270
something that's probably
not there.

1321
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:37,306
Maybe he's imagining it, or...

1322
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,408
This is where it gets
a little weird.

1323
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,777
Maybe he thinks
his kid is down there.

1324
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:42,778
His kid is one of them.

1325
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,845
Oh, boy.

1326
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:47,783
OK, I know... it's crazy. But if
we could just find one person,

1327
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:51,219
one person to vouch for him,
a family member, a neighbor,

1328
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:54,423
just somebody who actually
knows this guy in real life,

1329
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:56,858
not the life
that he's presenting to us,

1330
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,127
I'd feel so much better
because then I would know

1331
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:01,630
is he crazy? Is he mentally ill?

1332
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:05,701
Is it all a hoax?
And I'm just a sucker.

1333
01:00:05,703 --> 01:00:07,169
You know,
but you like you Google him

1334
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:10,639
and he has no digital imprint
on the internet whatsoever.

1335
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:12,774
There's literally
nothing about... What?

1336
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,676
Boston.

1337
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,215
He was a police...
He was a police detective.

1338
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,617
So, what?

1339
01:00:21,672 --> 01:00:23,752
No, the original package
that he sent me,

1340
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:26,388
the original letter,
it says he was a former

1341
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,924
Boston police detective.
We can go talk to them.

1342
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:30,392
We're not going to Boston.

1343
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:32,094
We're going to Boston.

1344
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:33,261
Awesome.

1345
01:00:33,263 --> 01:00:34,830
No, we're going to Boston.

1346
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,832
Awesome.

1347
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:45,307
Right now we're going to Boston
because I spoke to a guy

1348
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,150
at the Boston police department

1349
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:50,345
<i>but they wouldn't answer any</i>
<i>of my questions over the phone</i>

1350
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:52,681
<i>but the guy did say he would</i>
<i>give us, like, 15 minutes.</i>

1351
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:54,650
So, what I want to do is,
I want to sit down,

1352
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:59,021
I want to find out more about
when Dekker worked there,

1353
01:00:59,023 --> 01:01:01,256
<i>like, maybe there's people there</i>
<i>who still know him,</i>

1354
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:04,459
and like especially
if he's talked about The Marrow

1355
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:06,528
and all this stuff before.

1356
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:09,598
<i>I think we're to get some</i>
really<i>... some cool stuff.</i>

1357
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,866
Great.

1358
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,168
- I don't know.
- It seems like a

1359
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,736
waste of time to me.

1360
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,339
OK, well, you know what?

1361
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,708
If nothing else,
we get to go home to Boston.

1362
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,476
When was the last time you
got to go to Boston?

1363
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,198
<i>What, like three years ago,</i>
<i>four years ago?</i>

1364
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:26,214
<i>No, I was in Boston two</i>
<i>weeks ago shooting a cable ad.</i>

1365
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,687
Well, you don't have to shoot
a cable ad while you're there

1366
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:33,121
so, um... it'll be fun.

1367
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,312
<i>I've been with the</i>
<i>Boston Police Department</i>

1368
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:59,081
now for 24 years
and I don't ever recall

1369
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,963
working
with this gentleman. No.

1370
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,964
What department
did he say he worked with?

1371
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,788
<i>Uh... he didn't specify that.</i>

1372
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:09,758
Well, I suggest
you have him contact us

1373
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:11,359
and as you can understand,

1374
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:13,528
I can't get
into the service records

1375
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,864
of a former police officer
with a third party.

1376
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:18,033
<i>No, I,</i>
<i>I understand that totally.</i>

1377
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:20,902
<i>I just... I guess,</i>
<i>to clarify that,</i>

1378
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:24,106
<i>now, what you're saying is that,</i>
<i>to the best of your knowledge,</i>

1379
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,442
<i>a William Dekker</i>
<i>has never worked here</i>

1380
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:28,744
<i>at the Boston</i>
<i>Police Department?</i>

1381
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:30,779
That I know of? No.

1382
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,783
Just because the one guy
we talked to didn't know him

1383
01:02:34,785 --> 01:02:36,351
doesn't mean that it's a lie.

1384
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:38,453
I mean you heard
what the officer said.

1385
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:39,755
Even if he did know something,

1386
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,042
he's not allowed
to tell us anyway... so...

1387
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:46,294
worked there. I mean... clearly
the guy never worked there.

1388
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:49,931
You don't know that.
That's according to one officer.

1389
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:51,767
When we get home,

1390
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:53,869
let's go back out there
to the spot

1391
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:55,804
but just me and you.

1392
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:59,107
No Dekker, so that way
if this is like a hoax,

1393
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,409
he's putting stuff on for us.

1394
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:03,612
He wouldn't even know
that we're there. Just us.

1395
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,213
Right. Just so we can freak out

1396
01:03:05,254 --> 01:03:07,415
again and tell us how much
we are compromising his work

1397
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:08,817
and then quit.

1398
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,819
Not if he doesn't know.

1399
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:18,894
Is this it?

1400
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:20,395
Yeah...

1401
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:21,963
I know where we are.
Just park here.

1402
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,165
OK, cool.

1403
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:25,100
All right, let's do a quick
in and out, OK?

1404
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:26,423
I don't want to be
here all night.

1405
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:28,570
No, I just want to see
the spot without him here.

1406
01:03:28,572 --> 01:03:29,571
That's all.

1407
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:31,239
Wait, wait.
How do you...

1408
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:32,908
Just twist the dial on the side

1409
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,442
Like that?
- Yup, that's it.

1410
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:35,677
OK, all right. Got it.

1411
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,980
All right.

1412
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,950
Let's wait, wait<i> .</i> Shh.

1413
01:03:41,952 --> 01:03:43,218
What, what?

1414
01:03:46,577 --> 01:03:48,657
Do you hear that?
Was that your footsteps?

1415
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:49,758
No, I stopped.

1416
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,829
- Right, let's do it...
- Great.

1417
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,798
It's frigging hot tonight.

1418
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,999
Yeah.

1419
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,935
It's wicked, flack and...

1420
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,771
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- You good, you good?

1421
01:04:02,773 --> 01:04:04,005
Yeah, yeah, yeah trees.

1422
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,042
Well, I told you no more uh...

1423
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:08,677
no more ski-lifts at night,
right?

1424
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:10,799
So, this isn't that bad.
This is like home.

1425
01:04:11,061 --> 01:04:13,181
It's the woods.
You know what's funny though?

1426
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,716
What?
- Is that during the day

1427
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:16,184
it's like,
'Oh, I am in the forest.'

1428
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,386
But then at night, it's like

1429
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:18,820
"I am in the forest"

1430
01:04:18,822 --> 01:04:20,021
it's really scary.

1431
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,423
All right.

1432
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:25,527
And there it is...
OK, so... all right.

1433
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:26,862
Let me do my intro.

1434
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,499
<i>OK.</i>

1435
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:33,435
<i>All right, am I all sweaty?</i>

1436
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,871
<i>Um, a little shiny, not too bad</i>

1437
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:38,139
<i>- All right. OK.</i>
<i>- Hold on. OK?</i>

1438
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:41,142
- Into camera, right?
- Yup.

1439
01:04:41,144 --> 01:04:43,712
Here we are at the entrance
to The Marrow, or at least

1440
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:46,748
what Dekker claims to
be the entrance to The Marrow.

1441
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,284
<i>No. OK, hold on...</i>

1442
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,820
<i>Oh, my God...</i>

1443
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:55,090
I thought that was you.
Do you smell that?

1444
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:57,693
You realize
we're in a cemetery, right?

1445
01:04:57,694 --> 01:05:00,262
And uh... there's
dead bodies all around us.

1446
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:05,734
Um... I've stuck...
I've stuck my head in worse

1447
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:08,403
I actually went to Hopster
for four years so...

1448
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,105
All right, hold on.

1449
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,541
- OK.
<i>- Wait a minute.</i>

1450
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:15,010
<i>You realize we're in a cemetery</i>

1451
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,845
<i>and you're sticking</i>
<i>your head in a hole?</i>

1452
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:18,967
I know that, I know that...
but I got to see.

1453
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:20,582
Hello?

1454
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,951
Monsters?

1455
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:25,587
Yani?

1456
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,258
Yeah. Dude.

1457
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,094
OK, here's one thing
I will say, though, is...

1458
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:34,536
I don't know if you can see it

1459
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,232
but when you go down it
curves around

1460
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:40,869
Oh my God. Dude.
It's got me! It's got me!

1461
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,939
Nothing? Really?

1462
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:45,373
No, Jackass.

1463
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:46,908
Come on.
Can we get out of here?

1464
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,710
You're no fun.

1465
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:52,013
All right, well, good.
I'm glad we did that.

1466
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:55,483
Now we know
we have lots of footage

1467
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:58,553
of a crazy guy who should
probably be committed,

1468
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,455
rambling around about nothing.

1469
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,497
We have a hole
in the ground over here.

1470
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:05,961
We have lots of old gravestones,
and we have a dude,

1471
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:08,229
who was probably
one of Dekker's friends

1472
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:10,999
who jumped out at us wearing
nothing but a Halloween mask

1473
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:12,667
which is... whoa...

1474
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:13,835
Dude...

1475
01:06:13,837 --> 01:06:15,036
Sorry...
Oh!

1476
01:06:15,191 --> 01:06:17,472
Seriously, seriously help me
out please, please, please!

1477
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,274
<i>I'm not joking, I'm not joking!</i>

1478
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,212
Someone took my boot.

1479
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,814
He grabbed me.

1480
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:27,862
Well, at least
you still have your foot.

1481
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,377
No, I'm serious, something,
something... It took my boot.

1482
01:06:31,107 --> 01:06:32,787
You mean like a root
or something?

1483
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:35,957
No, something like
it didn't hurt...

1484
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:38,893
but it took my boot off
of my foot.

1485
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,331
Bullshit.

1486
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,634
Fine. You know what? Here.

1487
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:47,769
<i>Hey, uh dude, can you do me</i>

1488
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:48,937
<i>a favor really quick</i>

1489
01:06:49,012 --> 01:06:50,972
<i>and just reach in that hole</i>
<i>and um...</i>

1490
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:52,107
- Aha, yeah.
<i>- And grab my boot for me,</i>

1491
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:53,308
<i>please?</i>

1492
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:54,676
You want me to get your boot?

1493
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:56,211
<i>Yeah, yeah... come on... do it.</i>

1494
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:57,645
<i>There's nothing in there.</i>

1495
01:06:57,647 --> 01:06:59,347
- All right, all right...
<i>- Do it.</i>

1496
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,386
It's pretty deep.

1497
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:06,354
It's a...

1498
01:07:07,563 --> 01:07:09,724
You know what?
No, it's your boot. You get it.

1499
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:11,860
<i>Oh, oh, OK, yeah.</i>

1500
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:14,129
Here you go.

1501
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:15,563
You know what? Um...

1502
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:18,533
I was going to throw
these boots out

1503
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,869
when I got home tonight anyway
because they're old

1504
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:23,204
and they smell.
So I don't even need it.

1505
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,106
And you're going to
walk home in your sock?

1506
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,328
I'm going to walk home
in my sock.

1507
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,245
But what about the snakes?

1508
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,313
There's no snakes.

1509
01:07:32,315 --> 01:07:34,149
What about the spiders?

1510
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:35,550
<i>Oh! Spider!</i>
What, dude?

1511
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,085
Oh, you're such a dick.

1512
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:39,921
- Fine.
- Go get your boot.

1513
01:07:39,923 --> 01:07:41,089
I'll get my boot.

1514
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:44,898
If something happens
to me, seriously...

1515
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,462
Damn it!

1516
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,364
And don't do that thing where

1517
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:50,732
something grabs you again.

1518
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:54,102
I would never do
the same gag twice.

1519
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,571
Have you seen Hatchet 2?

1520
01:07:58,441 --> 01:07:59,641
Go on.

1521
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:02,610
Just give me a second.

1522
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:06,347
Holy shit!

1523
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:08,116
OK.

1524
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,354
Go on...
- I'm going, I'm going.

1525
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,669
I can't reach it.
I can't reach it.

1526
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:30,745
Wait, wait, wait.
OK, hold on.

1527
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Oh, shit!
Whoa... Hah!... Got it!
What the hell are you two doing?

1528
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:43,351
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1529
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:45,653
What have you done?
What have you done?

1530
01:08:45,655 --> 01:08:47,322
<i>Nothing, we were just getting</i>

1531
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:49,824
<i>some shots</i>
<i>without you out here...</i>

1532
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:52,427
<i>potentially orchestrating</i>
<i>this shit.</i>

1533
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:53,995
What do you mean
by orchestrating?

1534
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:56,564
I can hear you half
a mile down the goddamn road.

1535
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:58,433
You have no right
to come up here.

1536
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:00,735
No... but there, there,
honestly something down there

1537
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:01,897
just totally took my boot.

1538
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:04,139
I told you we needed
to be discrete.

1539
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:06,474
I warned you.
We could scare them away.

1540
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,476
I warned you some of them
are danger...

1541
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:11,579
Public place.

1542
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,275
We have every right to be here
if we want to.

1543
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:16,618
- Both of you, that was stupid.
- It's not stupid.

1544
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,486
Don't film this now.

1545
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:19,954
No, I'm not recording.

1546
01:09:19,956 --> 01:09:21,557
- You know what was stupid?
- You're not?

1547
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:24,259
No. Listen to me. What was
stupid? Was the other day

1548
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:25,827
when we took you out to coffee

1549
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,463
and I asked you point blank
have you said this shtick

1550
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:29,998
to anybody else.

1551
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,099
And what did you say?

1552
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:34,035
I said that I took it to
a multitude of places

1553
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:35,503
before I brought it to you.

1554
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,640
No. No, no, no, no, no... I
asked you point blank. Didn't I?

1555
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:39,707
I asked him point blank,

1556
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:43,344
I said "Have you said this to
other directors in Hollywood?"

1557
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:46,181
And you said, "No, just you".

1558
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:48,616
"Just you". Just me,
that's what you said.

1559
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:50,718
And it's not adding up
at this point.

1560
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,387
It's never going to add up.

1561
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:55,023
If they move away
because of your meddling

1562
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:57,158
- Our meddling?
- Yes, your meddling.

1563
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,394
No, we're trying to tell
a story here because,

1564
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:01,863
you know what, like what if,
what if it was real?

1565
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:03,998
I want to believe in it.
He wants to believe in it.

1566
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,902
And I've sunk a lot of my time,
and a lot of his money

1567
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:10,338
into this so far, and honestly,

1568
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,640
it feels like Linus
waiting for the great pumpkin

1569
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:13,808
to arrive or something.

1570
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,143
- No...
- For all we know,

1571
01:10:15,145 --> 01:10:16,545
this is just
a bunch of your buddies

1572
01:10:16,732 --> 01:10:19,013
running around in Halloween
costumes for our cameras.

1573
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:20,381
Well, maybe I don't need
the two of you

1574
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:21,983
involved in this anymore,
all right?

1575
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:24,519
But let's take this conversation
over to the road

1576
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:26,688
so we don't make the situation
any worse than it is.

1577
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:29,691
No. We're not taking
one more step until you admit

1578
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:30,959
that you've been lying.

1579
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:32,760
About?

1580
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:35,430
About... what haven't you lied
about? About everything.

1581
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:38,233
Monsters, The Marrow, your name.

1582
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:39,867
I don't even know
who you really are.

1583
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
My personal life is my business.
Do you understand?
It's my business.
We have been upfront with you
since day one.
You know exactly who we are...

1584
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:52,247
<i>- Get down...</i>
<i>- What the hell was that?</i>

1585
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,348
<i>I don't know what it was</i>

1586
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,591
<i>but it brushed against my feet.</i>
<i>It went over there.</i>

1587
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,188
<i>They're watching us.</i>

1588
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:07,996
<i>What was that?</i>

1589
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:44,565
<i>Guys?</i>

1590
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:59,013
<i>Come back... come back...</i>

1591
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,185
Did you get it?

1592
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,647
Yeah, I got it. I got it.
It came right at me.

1593
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,323
<i>Will, Will... come on...</i>

1594
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,258
<i>- I'm coming, I'm coming</i>
<i>- Let's go.</i>

1595
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,192
<i>Give me one second.</i>

1596
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:13,114
<i>I want to see it,</i>
<i>I want to see it.</i>

1597
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:25,873
<i>Come on man,</i>
<i>let's go, we gotta go now.</i>

1598
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:27,975
They're coming, they're coming.

1599
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:29,210
<i>I'm coming...</i>

1600
01:12:29,212 --> 01:12:31,846
- Come on, Adam.
<i>- Shut off those lights.</i>

1601
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,515
Shut it off.

1602
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:35,750
Come on, go...

1603
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:39,354
What is that? What?

1604
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,575
Drive around it,
drive around it.

1605
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,591
What the hell?

1606
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:53,301
<i>It's got him! It's got him!</i>

1607
01:12:53,303 --> 01:12:54,402
<i>-Let go! Let go!</i>

1608
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:25,166
<i>Drive, drive,</i>
<i>drive, drive drive!</i>

1609
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:37,178
<i>Has that ever happened before?</i>

1610
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:39,080
No, never to that extent.

1611
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,015
I mean, I've been followed once.

1612
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:42,350
I been chased a couple of times

1613
01:13:42,352 --> 01:13:44,085
but an outright attack
like that...

1614
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:45,208
You see what you've done!

1615
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,255
What I've done? OK, hold
the phone here.

1616
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:49,724
First of all, you have not been
straight with us

1617
01:13:49,726 --> 01:13:51,058
since day one.

1618
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,293
OK, starting with the fact

1619
01:13:52,368 --> 01:13:54,529
that you never worked for
the Boston Police Department.

1620
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:55,430
What?

1621
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:56,731
- You never...
- Yes, I did!

1622
01:13:56,733 --> 01:13:57,854
We went and met with them

1623
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,634
and they never even
heard of you.

1624
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:02,470
I was a private detective.
Private, you, imbecile.

1625
01:14:02,472 --> 01:14:03,938
Don't' you understand English,
huh?

1626
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,339
Do you speak English?

1627
01:14:05,622 --> 01:14:07,942
I understand it enough
to know that you would at least

1628
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,777
have been affiliated
with their division

1629
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:12,880
in one way or another. But no,
they've never even heard of you.

1630
01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:13,981
You know, I trusted you Adam.

1631
01:14:13,983 --> 01:14:16,417
I brought you into one of the
greatest discoveries of all ti...

1632
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:18,119
- Don't point your finger at me.
- ...you go and screw me!

1633
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:19,620
- I'm not...
- Why are you screwing me?

1634
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,556
Because I don't know
if it's bullshit or not!

1635
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:22,824
Why couldn't you listen to me?

1636
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:24,559
Because I didn't want to spend
five more months

1637
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:26,494
running around,
looking at sketches,

1638
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:27,628
and looking at drawings,

1639
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:29,063
and listening
to your psycho babble.

1640
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:30,186
Well, listen to you, man.

1641
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:31,466
You sound like all those
other assholes.

1642
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:33,468
You're too blind to see
what's going on around you.

1643
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:37,138
Oh, I saw, I saw
something today.

1644
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,773
I don't know what it was.
Do you know what it was, Will?

1645
01:14:38,775 --> 01:14:40,241
No.
- So, what was it?

1646
01:14:40,243 --> 01:14:42,310
Back me up here.
For once, back me up!

1647
01:14:42,312 --> 01:14:45,246
I'm going to go,
I'm going to go inside.

1648
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:46,569
Yeah, OK, you...
No, no, no, no...

1649
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:49,116
They know we found out
about them, Adam.

1650
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:50,885
They know we found them.

1651
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:52,320
They're going to move.

1652
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:54,182
They're going to close up
that entrance.

1653
01:14:54,257 --> 01:14:56,657
And I'm going to lose him,
and I'm not going to lose him.

1654
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,192
Who? Who's "him"?

1655
01:14:58,221 --> 01:15:00,261
This is my last chance
and I'm not going to blow it.

1656
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:03,097
Who is "him"? Just tell me the
truth about one single thing.

1657
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:06,534
OK, how about this, Mr. Dekker?
If that's even your name.

1658
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:07,602
What about the fact

1659
01:15:07,917 --> 01:15:09,637
that you went
to every director in Hollywood

1660
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:11,305
before you came
to us with this project, right?

1661
01:15:11,307 --> 01:15:13,474
What... well... I was like
the absolute last choice,

1662
01:15:13,476 --> 01:15:14,575
and I asked you

1663
01:15:14,597 --> 01:15:16,878
point blank, when we had coffee,
and you lied to me

1664
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,879
- about that too!
- Bullshit, bullshit,

1665
01:15:17,881 --> 01:15:18,946
bullshit, bullshit.

1666
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,649
OK, it's 1:30 in the morning.

1667
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:23,184
I think the best thing
to do right now,

1668
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:24,519
we were just attacked,

1669
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:25,987
let's call the police.
How about that?

1670
01:15:25,989 --> 01:15:26,988
- No!
- Call...

1671
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:28,623
No police, no police.

1672
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:30,892
No police, if they've moved,
then I'll dig.

1673
01:15:30,894 --> 01:15:33,160
I'll dig down. That tunnel's
still there, I'll dig.

1674
01:15:33,162 --> 01:15:34,729
Then you can call
anybody you want.

1675
01:15:34,731 --> 01:15:36,497
You call the whole goddamn
world, I don't care.

1676
01:15:36,499 --> 01:15:37,798
Just get out of here.
Now go on.

1677
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,568
Do we even have lights
in the car if we go down there?

1678
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,638
I got to plan this.
I got to plan it.

1679
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,639
Well... I...

1680
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:45,973
Get out! Go on, get out!

1681
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:47,074
If you're going down there

1682
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:48,876
I'm going with you and
I'm seeing this through.

1683
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,244
We need lights
from the office...

1684
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:51,746
- Adam!
- We need two more cameras.

1685
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:53,668
Listen, listen to me
for a second.

1686
01:15:56,111 --> 01:15:58,352
I'll meet with you here at
sunrise, you and Will.

1687
01:15:58,354 --> 01:15:59,420
All right?

1688
01:15:59,422 --> 01:16:02,056
Sunrise. Then you can shoot
any goddamn thing you want.

1689
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,090
You can shoot
as much as you want,

1690
01:16:03,152 --> 01:16:05,393
all right, I don't care.
Shoot whatever you want.

1691
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:07,194
OK. Sunrise here.

1692
01:16:07,196 --> 01:16:09,330
We've two cameras
at the office...

1693
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:10,364
Now go, please.

1694
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:11,465
You're coming with me.

1695
01:16:11,499 --> 01:16:13,100
I got to work.
I got to plan this<i> .</i>

1696
01:16:13,102 --> 01:16:14,201
Don't puss out on me on this.

1697
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:15,836
Get out... Get out!

1698
01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:17,572
- I'm going to get out...
- Get out, Will!

1699
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:18,573
Where do we meet you exactly?

1700
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:19,840
Here, here! At sunrise.

1701
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:20,741
Right here at sunrise.

1702
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,610
- Right here at sunrise.
- We will be back...

1703
01:16:22,612 --> 01:16:24,732
Get out of here, goddamn it!
I can't think!

1704
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,621
Maybe we should just go.

1705
01:16:33,623 --> 01:16:35,663
I find it hard
to believe he overslept.

1706
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,593
Mr. Dekker.

1707
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,662
Oh, wait a minute...

1708
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:45,466
Hold on.

1709
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:51,606
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse
me. Hello. Hello. Sorry.

1710
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,309
I'm trying to reach the guy that
lives there, your neighbor.

1711
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:56,777
<i>No one lives there.</i>

1712
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:59,580
No, no the guy, uh...
the old guy, William Dekker.

1713
01:16:59,582 --> 01:17:00,815
The guy lives there.

1714
01:17:00,817 --> 01:17:02,450
<i>No one lives there.</i>

1715
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:04,412
<i>That place has been</i>
<i>empty for a year.</i>

1716
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:07,221
OK, I am sorry, I'm sorry...

1717
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:11,993
- So...
- What?

1718
01:17:11,995 --> 01:17:13,527
According to Dekker's neighbor,

1719
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:16,263
this place has been empty
for a year.

1720
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:17,598
Wait, so nobody lives here?

1721
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,533
No-one is supposed to live here.

1722
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:23,838
No, no, no...
- Oh, what do you know.

1723
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,139
No, no...
- Come on, come one.

1724
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,707
Mr. Dekker?

1725
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,077
Are you kidding me?

1726
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,516
What, he just skipped town?

1727
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:40,755
What?
- Look, look, look.

1728
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:43,524
Oh, man...

1729
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:45,092
You know what?
No, we should...

1730
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:46,661
We should just go.
We shouldn't do this.

1731
01:17:46,663 --> 01:17:47,928
No, no, come here, come here.

1732
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:50,898
Man... Urgh.

1733
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:55,603
Urgh...

1734
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:03,177
Is that shit?

1735
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,547
- Urgh.
- What he...

1736
01:18:06,549 --> 01:18:07,882
It smells so bad.

1737
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:10,451
What the...
What did he have?

1738
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:15,489
Urgh... can we go?

1739
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:17,058
Yeah, did you get all this?

1740
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:19,060
- Did you see all this?
- Oh man, let's go.

1741
01:18:19,062 --> 01:18:21,696
Please, can we just go?
- OK, OK, OK.

1742
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:24,632
Dude, where we going?

1743
01:18:24,634 --> 01:18:26,367
Where do you think?
We're going after him.

1744
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:28,335
Oh, hell, no.
I'm not going down that hole.

1745
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:29,603
We're not going in the hole.

1746
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:31,166
- Will you just come with me?
- No,

1747
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:35,414
We're not going back there!
Just get into the car. Trust me.

1748
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,681
Come on...

1749
01:18:40,683 --> 01:18:42,650
Seriously, can we
please just call the police?

1750
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,119
Mr. Dekker?

1751
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:51,325
Oh... No, no, no, no, no...

1752
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:16,417
OK. Our final recording...

1753
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:18,419
in three, two...

1754
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:22,189
So, it's been
a little over a month

1755
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,924
since we last heard from...

1756
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,794
Dekker

1757
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:29,263
and I've tried calling,

1758
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:34,869
but like his number just rings
and about two weeks ago,

1759
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:36,637
it switched over to one of those

1760
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:39,640
"This number has been
disconnected" messages.

1761
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,210
But, last week...

1762
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:48,048
our missing camera,
camera two...

1763
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:52,486
was delivered to me...

1764
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:56,991
and, er...

1765
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:04,852
My name is...

1766
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:10,991
My name is William Dekker.

1767
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:14,061
If you're seeing this,

1768
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:19,500
I need you to understand
that I was wrong.

1769
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:26,907
There's no such thing
as "severo".

1770
01:22:26,909 --> 01:22:28,642
There are no monsters.

1771
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:31,845
Don't follow me.

1772
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:34,949
Don't believe my work.

1773
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:36,951
Stay away!

1774
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,823
There's no such thing
as monsters.

1775
01:22:42,825 --> 01:22:47,461
Monsters are not real.
Monsters are not real.

1776
01:22:48,831 --> 01:22:51,365
Monsters are not real!

1777
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
