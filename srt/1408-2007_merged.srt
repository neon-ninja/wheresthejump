1
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,543
Preacher on radio: reckless sinful
way throughout this life.

2
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,011
The Lord has told me

3
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,345
that the open
gates of Hell

4
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,078
are yawning up
widely in our path.

5
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:53,983
Yes, the flames

6
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,113
of perpetual damnation

7
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,125
are ever ready to grasp
our souls.

8
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,287
We know the way
of the righteous man.

9
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,387
Yeah, we know the prayer

10
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,092
of the righteous man.

11
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,640
I'm telling you
that the Lord has spoken.

12
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,806
Yes, the Lord has spoken
to me.

13
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,735
Hi.

14
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,833
Mike Enslin.
Checking in.

15
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,401
Honey.
Mr. Enslin.

16
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,003
We were afraid you
weren't going to show.

17
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,743
Oh it's such an honor
to have you here.

18
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,648
- Terrible night out there.
- If I could just get the key,

19
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,380
I'll settle in and we can
talk in the morning after...

20
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,514
You probably want to hear
all about our haunted history.

21
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,853
Well, this staircase here,
this is where the maid

22
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,189
reputedly hung herself
in 1860.

23
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,660
- Oh.
- There's a picture!

24
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,185
- Can we do this in the morning?
- Wait wait.

25
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,095
It's printed in
our brochure.

26
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,622
- Did we send you one of these?
- Uh, probably did.

27
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,362
- Do you see her in the window?
- Yeah, there she is.

28
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,394
That's a photo that
a guest took in 1986.

29
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,407
In your letter
you mentioned that the rooms

30
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,409
with the most
paranormal activity

31
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,468
were in the attic.
Could I have one of those rooms?

32
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,980
That's right, because the attic
is on the third floor

33
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,141
which is the former
servant's quarters.

34
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,617
People say that all
of Sylvia's children

35
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,519
died up there
of tuberculosis.

36
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,388
- All of them?
- Guests have reported strange sounds.

37
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,018
At the stroke of midnight
there's been weird noises.

38
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,688
Now our best advice
is to lock your door from the inside.

39
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,391
- Isn't that right, honey?
- That's right.

40
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,991
You take care, you just
lock it from the inside.

41
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,763
I will.

42
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,633
As soon as you
give me the key.

43
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,207
I'm so... right.
Got it right here.

44
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,144
- Number 14, you can't miss it.
- Been a long drive.

45
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,148
- Good luck.
- All right, we'll see

46
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,309
what the night brings.

47
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:17,983
Mike:
Mrs. Clark, the proprietor,

48
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,685
says she hasn't
slept a night

49
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,559
since acquiring the inn
and I believe her.

50
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,927
No no no,
I pity her.

51
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,626
But in any case, the eggs
Benedict are delicious

52
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,794
and if you call in advance,
Mrs. Clark says

53
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,397
she will bake her famous
flourless chocolate cake.

54
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,432
On a Shiver Scale, I award the Weeping
Beach Inn six skulls.

55
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,572
Screw 'em, five skulls.

56
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,825
- Hi.
- Oh hey.

57
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,525
How's it going?
Can I help you?

58
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,998
Yeah, I'm here
for the big event.

59
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,800
All right.
Cool.

60
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,168
I'm Mike Enslin.

61
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,298
Sorry?

62
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,041
- Book signing.
- Oh, right.

63
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:14,535
Oh, that's you, yeah.
I see the resemblance, yeah.

64
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,639
- That's a good picture.
- Thanks, man.

65
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,241
All right, hold on.

66
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,412
Um... attention,
book lovers.

67
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,912
Tonight we have noted
occult writer

68
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,788
Michael Enslin

69
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,556
at the Author's Corner
tonight.

70
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,860
He's the writer of the best-selling
ghost survival guides,

71
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,232
um... with such titles
as "10 Haunted Hotels,"

72
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,397
"10 Haunted Graveyards,"

73
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,997
"10 Haunted Lighthouses."

74
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,474
That's tonight, 7:00 pm.

75
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,773
Mike: Anyway, so I really
enjoyed writing it,

76
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,746
and that's kind of
a history of the book.

77
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,874
And I hope you enjoy it,
or enjoyed it.

78
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,408
Uh, you know,
stay scared.

79
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,852
Right?
Any questions?

80
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,185
Where's the scariest place
you've ever been?

81
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,350
Scariest place
I've ever been?

82
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,383
Uh, I've never heard
that question before.

83
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,622
That's a joke.

84
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,995
Well, all these places have
very colorful histories.

85
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,590
Um...

86
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,726
I would say, if I had to
pick a top one,

87
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,760
I would say
Bar Harbor,

88
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,830
the site of the grisly
McTeig wedding night murders.

89
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,570
That's an intense place.
Or maybe St. Cloud, Minnesota,

90
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,511
where the crazed war widow
threw her baby down a well.

91
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,878
I mean, those all have a lot
of... I mean, it's thick.

92
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,713
- The air is thick.
- What about poltergeists?

93
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,619
Look, I'm a good researcher.
I go into every gig locked and loaded.

94
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,885
I travel with an EMF meter,
full-range spectrometer,

95
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,620
infrared camera. I mean, look,
nothing would make me happier

96
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,594
than to experience
a paranormal event,

97
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,359
you know, to get a glimpse
of the elusive light

98
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,764
at the end of the tunnel.

99
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,966
So you're saying there's
no such thing as ghosts?

100
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,766
I'm saying
I've never seen one,

101
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,173
but they're awful convenient
for desperate hotels

102
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,404
when the interstate moves away.

103
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,141
This thing has really
gone off the rails. Who has a pen?

104
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,741
- I do.
- Which one?

105
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:01,015
Uh, but seriously, Mike,
if I want to see a real live ghost,

106
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,816
where's my best bet?

107
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,152
- Guaranteed?
- Yeah.

108
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,748
Haunted Mansion,
Orlando.

109
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,987
Awesome, thanks.

110
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,587
- Stay scared.
- Thank you.

111
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,461
Cashier:
Hey, Ray, can you lock up?

112
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,433
I got band practice tonight.

113
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,095
Holy shit.

114
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,626
What rock did you
find that under?

115
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,696
- Um, eBay.
- eBay, huh?

116
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,765
How much did it go for?

117
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,334
Well, there weren't
many bidders.

118
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,812
I would think not.

119
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,816
- Wow.
- But it's, um...

120
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,579
- an amazing book.
- Oh.

121
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,382
Um, so... unique

122
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,356
and inspirational
and honest.

123
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,086
Thanks.
What's your name?

124
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,151
- Um, Anna.
- Okay, Anna.

125
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,288
Are you gonna write another
one like this one?

126
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,161
Nah, it's
a different guy.

127
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,167
Um...

128
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,169
- can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

129
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,536
Um, the relationship
in the book

130
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,269
with the father and the son...
it's probably too personal,

131
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,904
- but, um, it's so authentic and...
- Mm-hm.

132
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,506
well-constructed,
and...

133
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,449
is it true?

134
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,113
No.

135
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,315
Well, thank you for this.
I really appreciate it.

136
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,721
My pleasure.

137
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,315
Bye.

138
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,209
- Man: Good boy!
- Man #2: Yo, homey...

139
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,372
Woman:
Just a minute, Tiffany!

140
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,677
Yeah, I'm just gonna tie it
inside my suit here.

141
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,365
Man:
Yo, Greg, check him out!

142
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,139
Woman:
Did you see what happened?

143
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,043
Oh yeah.

144
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,906
Are you okay, buddy?

145
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,943
Hey, are you breathing?

146
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,755
- Woman: No!
- Man: Serious as a heart attack.

147
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:05,097
We got 325.
That is back here, I think.

148
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,900
Uh-huh.

149
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,737
This is the one.
Sign on the line, please, sir.

150
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,333
Oh, you mean
right here?

151
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,210
- Have yourself a beautiful day.
- Thank you.

152
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,510
- Thank you very much.
- Hey, man, you've been gone a while.

153
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,847
- Hey, Jackson, what's up?
- Oh by the way, dude,

154
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,853
I read your last book...
the "10 Haunted Mansions" thing.

155
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,479
Man, that's some
scary shit.

156
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,820
Cool.

157
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,485
Later on, dude.

158
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,889
- Hi.
- Hi, how you doing?

159
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,093
- Hi.
- Good.

160
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,965
Thanks.

161
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,646
That's cute.

162
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,882
Woman: Good evening,
Dolphin Hotel.

163
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,445
How might I direct
your call?

164
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,354
Mike:
Yeah, hi, I'm calling about room 1408.

165
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,154
One moment please, sir.

166
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,526
Man:
How may I help you?

167
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,054
Yeah, I'd like to stay in
room 1408 please.

168
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,557
That room is
unavailable, sir.

169
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,934
I didn't tell you
which date.

170
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,206
How about Saturday?

171
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,004
It's unavailable.

172
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,978
The following Tuesday?

173
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,744
Unavailable.

174
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,546
Next month?

175
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,052
Unavailable.

176
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,282
Next summer?

177
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,149
Man: Somebody, anybody,
where's good Chinese near 48th?

178
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,482
I got to have lunch with
that idiot from Random House. Anybody?

179
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,511
Sam, Mike Enslin calling
from Los Angeles again.

180
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,955
I'll take it in there.

181
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,424
Clay, you got a sec for
Mike Enslin?

182
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,926
- Say yes.
- Yes.

183
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,486
Great. Now look, this guy
tends to get a little morose,

184
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,794
so try to keep the energy up.
Otherwise he stews in his own funk.

185
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,129
- Mike!
- Mike: Hey, Sam.

186
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,294
Hey hey, read the first
five chapters last night.

187
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,963
Spooky shit,
couldn't sleep a wink.

188
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,938
Great. Hey, did you take care
of that thing?

189
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,942
You'd better believe I did.
And I got our top lawyer here right now.

190
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,102
Mike, Clay,
Clay, Mike.

191
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,372
- Hi, Clay.
- Mike.

192
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,276
Talk fast, all right?
This guy's $400 an hour.

193
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,803
All right, Clay,
what's up with the Dolphin?

194
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,247
Yeah, the Dolphin.

195
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,843
That stick-up-its-ass
relic on Lexington.

196
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,911
Too posh for
a free plug, right?

197
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,218
Well, you are gonna love
what Clay's cooked up.

198
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,782
He dug around and found you...
are you sitting down?

199
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,260
- a Federal
Civil Rights law.

200
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,320
Like somebody would
discriminate against you,

201
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,458
a well-to-do white guy.
But the law's the law, right, Clay?

202
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,161
Ergo, if the room's
not occupied

203
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,170
- they have to give it to you.
- Really?

204
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,468
Yeah. Now look, the manager there's
gonna put up a stink

205
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,734
but he knows the drill.

206
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,173
- Nothing you can't handle.
- So, Mike...

207
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,733
we'll book the room
and if they refuse

208
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,642
we'll rattle our sabers
and file suit.

209
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,147
- So it's all done?
- Thanks, Clay. Get lost, all right?

210
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,241
Bye, Clay.

211
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,616
Yeah, Mike,
are you there?

212
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,020
Yeah, uh, on a more
personal note,

213
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,580
are you sure
you want to come here?

214
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,491
Yeah, of course. It'll make a solid
closing chapter of the book.

215
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,223
Yeah yeah,
I know the routine.

216
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,255
But, I mean,
it's New York.

217
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,201
All that happened... you really want
to put yourself through that?

218
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,534
- I'll be quick.
- Are you gonna call Lily?

219
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,541
No.
I don't want to impose.

220
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,669
In and out.
Nobody gets hurt.

221
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,444
It's just a job.

222
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,888
Driver:
Here you are, Dolphin.

223
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,557
Man:
Hey! Taxi!

224
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:45,718
Woman: It's a beautiful room,
with fabulous views of the city.

225
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,118
Woman: It's a beautiful room,
with fabulous views of the city.

226
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,745
Pardon me, ladies.

227
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,669
Man:
Thanks very much.

228
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,193
Welcome to
the Dolphin, sir.

229
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,206
- Are you checking in?
- Mike Enslin.

230
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,468
One night.

231
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,999
And how are we
spelling that today?

232
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,308
- N-S-L-l-N?
- N-S-L-l-N.

233
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,540
Yeah.

234
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,350
Uh, would you excuse me
for a moment, sir?

235
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,118
Sure.

236
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,253
Mr. Dempsey, Mike Enslin's
just checked in.

237
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,765
- Where is he?
- He's over at my desk.

238
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,199
That's fine, Marie.
I'll take care of it.

239
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,600
Okay.

240
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,999
It'll just be a minute,
Mr. Enslin.

241
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,414
Good evening, sir.
Can I help you with your bag?

242
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,919
- No.
- Very well.

243
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,484
Mr. Enslin,
I'm Gerald Olin,

244
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,288
manager of
the Dolphin.

245
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,262
If there's anything that I can do
for you while you're here...

246
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,560
dinner reservations,
theater tickets,

247
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,327
maybe a Knicks game?
Anything...

248
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,358
just tell me.
I am at your service.

249
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,530
Well, if I can just get the key to 1408,
I can get out of your hair.

250
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:17,303
Oh, we were thinking
of upgrading you to a penthouse suite.

251
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,868
1408, please.

252
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,039
Insistent,
aren't we?

253
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,946
Could you please
humor me

254
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,976
by coming to my office for a more
private conversation?

255
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,420
- Sure.
- Excellent.

256
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,960
Come in.
Make yourself comfortable.

257
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,528
1408 a smoking room?

258
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,864
As a matter of fact,
it is. Yes.

259
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,302
Good, one less worry in
the watches of the night.

260
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,272
Care for a cigar?

261
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,434
No thank you,
I don't smoke.

262
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,239
Oh this, yeah.
That's...

263
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,711
in case nuclear war
breaks out.

264
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,907
I gave it up
a long time ago.

265
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,813
It's part habit,
part superstition.

266
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,215
It's, you know,
a writer thing.

267
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,014
You do drink,
don't you?

268
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,816
Of course, I just said
I was a writer.

269
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,154
Le Cinquante Sept
Deces, 1939.

270
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,988
Exquisite.

271
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,222
About $800 a bottle,
when you can find it.

272
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,129
I appreciate the bribe,
but I intend on staying in that room.

273
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,492
- How long?
- How long?

274
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,130
My usual is
overnight.

275
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,139
I see.

276
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,006
No one's ever lasted
more than an hour.

277
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,977
Jesus, man.

278
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,070
You ought to shave your eyebrows
and paint your hair gold

279
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,604
if you're gonna try
to sell that spookhouse bullshit.

280
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,082
Otherwise, you'll
scare the children.

281
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,176
Why are you mocking me
when I am genuinely,

282
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,414
to the best of my ability,
trying to help you?

283
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,184
No, you're playing
a little game.

284
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,453
You're selling
the mystique.

285
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,892
But eventually,
we both know

286
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,453
you're gonna give me the key
and I'm gonna go up to the room

287
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,193
and I'm gonna write my story
and your bookings are gonna go up 50%.

288
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,566
Do you mind if my little friend records
our conversation?

289
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,772
I'll take that as a yes.

290
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,209
Sir, you quite
misunderstand the situation.

291
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,543
Now, I know the Dolphin
doesn't have the cachet of the Plaza

292
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,276
or the Carlyle,

293
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,444
but we operate
at 90% capacity.

294
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,646
Always.

295
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,349
And my concern here
is not for the hotel.

296
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,915
My concern here
is not for you.

297
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,223
Frankly, selfishly,

298
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,230
I don't want you
to check into 1408

299
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,596
because I don't want
to clean up the mess.

300
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:25,034
Now hotels are all
about presentation

301
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,630
and fertile
creature comforts.

302
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,642
My training is
as a manager,

303
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,644
not a coroner.

304
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,977
Under my watch there have
been four deaths... four.

305
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,574
After the last one,
I forbade any guest

306
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,881
from checking
into 1408 ever again.

307
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,252
The last one was David Hide,
orthodontist, manic-depressive.

308
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,416
Slit his wrist,
did a little self-surgery,

309
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,925
turned himself into
a eunuch, right?

310
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,451
Yes. So you've
done your homework.

311
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,622
I'm a professional too.

312
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,564
Well, grievously, in its
95-year existence,

313
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,000
the hotel has seen
seven jumpers,

314
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,060
four overdoses,
five hangings,

315
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,332
- three mutilations...
- Three mutilations...

316
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,067
two stranglings.
General manager Gerald Olin

317
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,234
is well-versed in
the hotel's tragic history,

318
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,074
dryly reciting the docket
of carnage like a bookkeeper

319
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,841
discussing his ledger.

320
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,940
Well, you think
you're clever, don't you?

321
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,314
I know the game.

322
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,750
Well, during
your investigation,

323
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,276
did you discover
the 22 natural deaths

324
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,312
that have occurred
in 1408?

325
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,423
Natural deaths?

326
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,792
Ah, didn't find out
about them

327
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,356
because the newspapers don't
print anything about them.

328
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,732
Hmm. All told,
there have been 56 deaths

329
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,202
in 1408.

330
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,468
56?
You're shitting me.

331
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,304
You don't know anything.

332
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,368
The causes of death
in 1408 range

333
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,846
from heart attack,
stroke, drowning...

334
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,577
- Drowning?
- Yes, one Mr. Grady Miller

335
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,744
drowned
in his chicken soup.

336
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,152
That's hard to do.
How... how did he do that?

337
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,781
How indeed?

338
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,815
Interesting.
It's all in here.

339
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,227
I will let you have this
and give you access to my office.

340
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,595
You can take notes,
put it all in your book.

341
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,827
My only condition

342
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,565
is that you do not
stay in that room.

343
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,301
You'll let me look
at all that stuff?

344
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,332
Hmm.

345
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,020
I never did
get that drink.

346
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,972
- Oh, that is good.
- Here, keep it.

347
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,034
Compliments
of the house.

348
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,351
- I'm still staying.
- Damn it to hell!

349
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,291
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,386
All right here.
Here, read the godforsaken thing.

351
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,522
I guarantee you,
once you've read it

352
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,931
you won't want to stay
in 1408.

353
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,166
The first victim:
Mr. Kevin O'Malley,

354
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,002
sewing machine salesman.

355
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,905
Checked into the hotel
the first week it opened...

356
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,877
- October, 1912.
- Cut his own throat, right?

357
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,469
Oh, that's not
the horrific part.

358
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,538
Afterwards, in a fit
of insanity,

359
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,016
he tried to stitch
himself back together

360
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,485
using an old sewing needle
before he bled to death.

361
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,215
Easy, man.

362
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,247
Look, Mr. Enslin,
you don't have to stay in 1408.

363
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,317
You can take
photographs of 1404.

364
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,887
It has the exact same layout and no one
will ever know the difference.

365
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,592
- My readers expect the truth.
- Your readers?

366
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,431
Your readers expect
grotesqueries

367
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,630
and cheap thrills.

368
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,402
"The headless ghost
of Mr. Eugene Rilsby

369
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,204
still walks
his abandoned farmhouse."

370
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:54,679
"The Barking Phantom
of Mount Hope Cemetery."

371
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,442
A direct quote...
how'd you know that?

372
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,244
Your books aren't
hard to find.

373
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,148
They're on the bargain
shelves

374
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,915
of any paperback
novel store;

375
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:06,481
full of cynicism,
written by a talented, intelligent man

376
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,187
who doesn't believe
in anything or anyone but himself.

377
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:12,128
Guilty as charged.

378
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,962
Hey listen, this meeting's over.
Why don't you give me the room?

379
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,491
Oh please, don't act
like a hurt schoolgirl.

380
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,596
- In fact, you surprised me.
- Oh.

381
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,472
You are not
the hack-n-slash I expected.

382
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,102
I rather liked the first one,
the hardcover.

383
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,841
What was it called?
"The Last Walk..."

384
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,178
"Long Road Home."

385
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:34,185
"The Long Road Home,"
yes.

386
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,687
I rather thought
the father was a bastard.

387
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,622
Yeah, he was.

388
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,682
Um...

389
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,193
Iook man, just
give me the key.

390
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:45,321
- Mr. Enslin...
- Just give me the key!

391
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,390
Listen, I stayed
at the Bigsby house.

392
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:51,368
I brushed my goddamn teeth
right next to the tub

393
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,701
where Sir David Smith
drowned his whole family.

394
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,708
And I stopped being afraid
of vampires when I was 12.

395
00:22:56,742 --> 00:23:00,303
Do you know why I can stay
in your spooky old room, Mr. Olin?

396
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,143
Because I know that
ghoulies and ghosties

397
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,479
and long-legged beasties
don't exist.

398
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,108
Even if they did,

399
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,747
there's no God to protect
us from them, is there?

400
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,482
So I can't talk you
out of this?

401
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,086
I think we've reached
an understanding.

402
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,563
Very well.

403
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,158
Come with me.

404
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,446
Most hotels have
switched to magnetics.

405
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,917
An actual key.
That's a nice touch... it's antiquey.

406
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:43,512
We have magnetic cards also, but
electronics don't seem to work in 1408.

407
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,420
Hope you don't have
a pacemaker.

408
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,426
General manager claims that the phantom
in room interferes...

409
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,553
I have never used
the word "phantom."

410
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,063
Oh, I'm sorry.
Spirit? Specter?

411
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,622
No, you misunderstand.

412
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,930
Whatever's in 1408
is nothing like that.

413
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,766
Then what is it?

414
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,239
It's an evil
fucking room.

415
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,303
Please.

416
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:13,643
Mr. Odin.

417
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,483
Oh, oui.
Tres bien.

418
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,485
Why don't the owners
just close the room?

419
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,632
The Yasuko Corporation
prefers to pretend there's no problem.

420
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,659
Just as they pretend
there's no 13th floor.

421
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,273
The room,
it's got to be filthy.

422
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,502
I mean, the sheets haven't been changed
in what? 11 years?

423
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,477
No no no,
we're very professional.

424
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,948
1408 gets a light
turn once a month.

425
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,212
I supervise, the maids
work in pairs.

426
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,015
We treat the room
as if it's a chamber

427
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,578
filled with poison gas.

428
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:54,319
We only stay 10 minutes
and I insist the door remain open.

429
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,725
But still...

430
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,658
A few years ago, a young
maid from El Salvador

431
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,258
found herself locked
in the bathroom.

432
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,529
She was only there
for a few moments,

433
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,560
but when we pulled
her out, she was...

434
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,335
- She was dead.
- No, blind.

435
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,569
She had taken a pair
of scissors

436
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,578
and gouged
her eyes out.

437
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,978
She was laughing hysterically.

438
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,312
- Ouch.
- Your floor.

439
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,111
Well, this is where
we part company.

440
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,383
This is as close
as I get to 1408

441
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,481
unless it's that time
of the month.

442
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:31,123
- See you tomorrow.
- Mr. Enslin?

443
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,130
Please...

444
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:35,132
don't do this.

445
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,338
I'll call you about
those Knicks tickets.

446
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,681
Stop it!

447
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,495
Okay. It's okay, sweetie.
We're home now.

448
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,623
Here we go.

449
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,558
This is it?

450
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,229
You got to be kidding me.

451
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,518
Round one goes to the hideous Mr. Olin
for effective aggressiveness.

452
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,889
I have to admit,
he had me going for a moment.

453
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,993
But where is
the bone-chilling terror?

454
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,794
Show me the rivers
of blood.

455
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,240
It's just a room.

456
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,418
$8 for beer nuts.

457
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,981
This room is evil.

458
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:57,085
Mike's voice: Olin said hotels are about
fertile creature comforts.

459
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,426
It's a good line,
but I wonder

460
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,262
whether they're really
about reassuring platitudes,

461
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,791
a prosaic sense
of the familiar.

462
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:08,203
"Yes, I've
been here before.

463
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:11,367
It's safe."

464
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,900
There's a sofa,

465
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,437
a writing desk,
a faux antique armoire,

466
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,609
floral wallpaper.

467
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,017
Carpet's unremarkable,
except for a stain

468
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:25,250
beneath a thrift-store painting
of a schooner lost at sea.

469
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,589
The work is done in the
predictably dull fashion

470
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,491
of Currier & lves.

471
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,019
The second painting
is of an old woman

472
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,294
reading bedtime stories...
a Whistler knockoff...

473
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,096
to a group
of deranged children

474
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:40,832
as another Madonna and child
watch from the background.

475
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:44,535
It does have
the vague air of menace.

476
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:48,637
The third and final
painfully dull painting

477
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,671
is the ever-popular
"The Hunt."

478
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,343
Horses, hounds
and constipated British lords.

479
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,444
Some smartass spoke about
the banality of evil.

480
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,546
If that's true,

481
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,354
then we're in
the seventh circle of Hell.

482
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,796
It does have
its charms.

483
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
The panorama is typically cramped
New York City view of nothing:
Dull, grey
buildings all around;
Honking traffic below.
The view of a...

484
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:26,781
- Radio: # We've only just begun... #
- Ow!

485
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:30,948
- # To live... #
- Holy shit.

486
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:35,289
# White lace
and promises #

487
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:41,664
# A kiss for luck
and we're on our way #

488
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,191
# We've only begun #

489
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,535
# Before the rising sun... #

490
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,542
Bravo, Olin.
That is very unsettling.

491
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:58,446
# So many roads
to choose #

492
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:04,115
# We start off walking
and learn to run #

493
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,089
# And yet
we've just begun... #

494
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,388
That means
someone's in the room.

495
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,894
Hello?

496
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,093
Hello!

497
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,797
Whoa.

498
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,876
That is bizarre.

499
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,316
Finally I got
something to write about.

500
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,819
A ghost that offers
turn-down service.

501
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,020
All right.

502
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,892
All right, let's Encyclopedia
Brown this bitch.

503
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,896
Started off the window,

504
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,955
hear the music,
nab my head.

505
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,467
I turn around, go to
the bed for the chocolate.

506
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,469
Then I go into the closet
which would have...

507
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,494
my back was turned.
It would have let

508
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,906
Houdini have time to come in
here do the paper trick...

509
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,570
and he's in the living room.

510
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,121
Out!

511
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,501
Huh.

512
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,871
Hello?

513
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,250
You're gonna have to
try harder, asshole!

514
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,314
Nice and warm
for you up there?

515
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,019
It's hot down here,
bubba.

516
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,030
Come on.

517
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,452
- Woman: Front desk.
- Hello, this is Mike Enslin.

518
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,786
- Guess which room.
- Good evening, sir.

519
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,815
- Good evening.
- Are you ready to check out?

520
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,724
Check out?
No no no no no.

521
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,558
Check out, check out, no.
Why would I check out?

522
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:29,032
Especially with this wonderful
maid service. It's so discreet.

523
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,661
No no no, I need you to send somebody
to fix my thermostat.

524
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,966
- Room's on fire.
- Of course, sir.

525
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,563
We'll send an engineer
right up.

526
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,074
- You will?
- Absolutely.

527
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,872
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

528
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,420
How many thin walls

529
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,650
have we put up
with together,

530
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,682
old boy?

531
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,527
How many sarcophagal chambers?

532
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,497
Hotel rooms are a naturally
creepy place...

533
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,062
don't you think?

534
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,437
I mean, how many people
have slept in that bed before you?

535
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,066
How many of them
were sick?

536
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,339
How many of them
lost their minds?

537
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:52,744
How many of them... died?

538
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,983
We came here
to get the story,

539
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,888
and we don't rattle,
do we?

540
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,511
It's not that what
I'm seeing is not real.

541
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,810
It just ain't as real
as it seems.

542
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,050
Hello?

543
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,648
Man: You got a problem
with the temperature?

544
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,893
Yeah.

545
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,460
Come on.

546
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,837
Is it too hot
or too cold?

547
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,776
What does it look like?

548
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,904
Come on in.

549
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,812
The box is
right over here.

550
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,373
It's stuck around 80.

551
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,579
I said the box
is right here.

552
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,216
I know where the hell it is,
but I ain't going in this room.

553
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,084
You just have to walk
six or seven feet.

554
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,620
I said I ain't going in.
You know what happened in here?

555
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:21,893
Yes, I'm well aware
of that.

556
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,797
Look, I'll talk
you through it.

557
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,961
Any jackass can fix
that thing.

558
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,868
Just remove the panel.

559
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,671
Okay, now above that coil

560
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,475
is a little tube
filled with mercury.

561
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,948
That's supposed to activate
the contact switch.

562
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,111
But this hotel's so goddamn old,
half the shit in here don't work.

563
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,814
Just give the tube
a little tap.

564
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,446
Just tap the damn thing!

565
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,488
Yeah, there it is.

566
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,961
Oh, sir,
you're a genius.

567
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,987
A gentleman and a scholar.

568
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,521
Thank you.
Let me give you...

569
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,999
a tip.

570
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,363
Sir?

571
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Radio:
#And yet we've just begun #

572
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,841
# Sharing horizons... #

573
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,812
Son of a...

574
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,463
Nobody lasts
more than an hour.

575
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,142
Very effective.

576
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

577
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,248
Oh fuck!
Jesus!

578
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,177
Oh, God.

579
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,814
Ow!
Son of a...

580
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,642
Ow! Fuck!
Agh!

581
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,307
Ow!
God!

582
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:58,275
# We've only just begun #

583
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,112
# To li... #

584
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,590
Hello?

585
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,532
- Hello?
- Woman: Sir, I'm afraid there was

586
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,434
a miscommunication
in the kitchen.

587
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,632
There's going to be a 10-minute delay
with your sandwich.

588
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:23,799
Sandwich?
What sandwich?

589
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,706
I didn't order any sandwich.
What are you talking about?

590
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,233
I'm sorry.
You're welcome to substitute

591
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,246
a side dish for
your French fries.

592
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,305
We have cottage cheese,
macaroni salad,

593
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,282
- coleslaw...
- Listen to me. You win.

594
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,251
I'm checking out.
I'm hurt.

595
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,516
Do you understand?
My goddamn hand is hurt.

596
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,319
I understand. If you leave your dry
cleaning out by 10:00 AM,

597
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,484
we'll have it pressed
and returned by 5:00...

598
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:44,824
Shit, bitch! Call me a cab
to the nearest hospital!

599
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,797
I'm hurt! Do you comprehend
what I'm telling you?

600
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:50,994
Sir, I will not tolerate you speaking
to me in that tone of voice.

601
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,970
You're an idiot!
I'm gonna sue your ass!

602
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,438
I'm gonna take legal action!
What's wrong with you?

603
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:59,704
If you wish, I can connect you
with our manager Mr. Olin.

604
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,870
Good! Good good good
good good! Put him on.

605
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,107
Put him on. I'm gonna blitz
the son of a bitch.

606
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,013
Olin... good!
Put him on now!

607
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,282
Man's voice: When staying at
the Dolphin, be certain to enjoy

608
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:13,256
New York's finest dining at the fabled
Sea Bream restaurant

609
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,451
on our mezzanine level.
Muscles tense?

610
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,960
Then make an appointment
to visit our deluxe spa

611
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,792

- it will leave you feeling relaxed...
- Hello?

614
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,659
and revitalized.
Your call is important to us...

615
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,433
You bitch.

616
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,101
You win.
You win.

617
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,336
All right.
Okay!

618
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,609
Come on.
Come on!

619
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,493
Come on.
Come on.

620
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,969
Hey!

621
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,810
Help!
Help!

622
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,358
Help! Help!

623
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,328
Can anybody hear me?

624
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,835
Help!

625
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,565
You! Sir!
Sir! Help!

626
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:40,943
Yeah!
Yeah, you! Help!

627
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:44,004
Help! Help!
You, sir!

628
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,877
Help!
Can you see me?

629
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:51,149
Yeah!
The Dolphin Hotel!

630
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,088
Call the police!

631
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,820
Help!

632
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,455
Help!

633
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Hey!
Look out!

634
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,601
Hey!

635
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,782
I'm losing my mind.

636
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,450
Girl's voice:
I can see you, Dad.

637
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:42,630
Daddy?
Daddy, where are you?

638
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,296
I'm gonna get you.

639
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:49,828
Ready or not,

640
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:51,807
here I come.

641
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,844
Here you are.

642
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,717
I see you, Daddy.

643
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,016
Get ahold of yourself.

644
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,322
You're running to places
that aren't real.

645
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,487
Get up. Get up.

646
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,723
You're losing the plot.

647
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:24,204
You're losing
the whole goddamn structure.

648
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:27,608
Girl:
Daddy! Find me.

649
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:30,613
Psychokinetic
fibrillations.

650
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:33,878
A tired mind among classic haunted-house
powers of suggestion.

651
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,817
Gaslit features,
faded rugs,

652
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,980
like that motel
in Kansas.

653
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,717
There's a reason for everything.
Just think.

654
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:45,393
What's that?

655
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,558
What is that?
Is that a spycam?

656
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,127
Who is that?
Are you enjoying this?

657
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,071
Is that the sadistic owner
of the hotel or is that Olin?

658
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,309
Wait a minute.

659
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,644
He gave me booze.

660
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,343
He gave me booze.
Did he take a sip?

661
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,517
I can't remember.

662
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,450
He dosed me!

663
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,584
It was the booze
or the chocolates.

664
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,595
Never take candy
from strangers.

665
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:21,325
All right, all right.
I'm just hallucinating.

666
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,595
I'm just hallucinating.

667
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,067
I've just got to
ride this out.

668
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,569
I've got to
ride this out

669
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:29,094
for four or five hours
and I'm straight. Okay.

670
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:31,872
You can do this.

671
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,373
Woman:
Oh, man. I'm gonna get you.

672
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,972
You are finished.
Come here. Come here!

673
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:41,416
Dad! Sit down!

674
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,043
Mike:
You want me to sit down?

675
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,020
Mike:
You want me to sit down?

676
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,648
- Yes!
- Okay, hold on, hold on.

677
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,215
Let me find a good...

678
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,920
let me find a good
frame here.

679
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,659
Ladies and gentlemen,

680
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:57,758
welcome to the Most
Ugliest Person Competition.

681
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,403
Fifth and fourth place

682
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,871
goes to Boris and Doris
the goldfish.

683
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:07,309
Ladies and gentlemen!
Let's get a closeup of those guys.

684
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,209
Let's have a closeup
of Boris and Doris.

685
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:12,044
Look at that.
Those are some ugly fish.

686
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,448
They're so ugly
they're running from you.

687
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,452
Third place
goes to Mike Enslin.

688
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,215
Surprise surprise.

689
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:21,315
Right, how's this for ugly?

690
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:28,063
Second place
goes to Lily Enslin.

691
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:31,226
That was good.

692
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:34,829
That's kind of like Beowulf
meets a redneck.

693
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:39,069
- I like it.
- And first place goes to Katie Enslin.

694
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,370
That is a terror.
That is...

695
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:45,608
oh, God! Don't show
me that face!

696
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,310
Oh, I can't look
at it again.

697
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,945
Lily:
Whatever you do, don't turn around.

698
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,751
Whatever you do,
don't show us that face.

699
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,660
Ma'am, can you hear me?

700
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:10,765
Ma'am, I need your help.

701
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,732
Please, ma'am,
can you hear me?

702
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:18,837
Kid, be quiet.

703
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,775
Please, ma'am.

704
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,442
Quiet!

705
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:21,366
Man:
I... wish...

706
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:25,136
I was dead.

707
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,504
Where's my garden?

708
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:34,845
I can't smell anything.

709
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,877
I hate this place.

710
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:45,017
How did I get here?

711
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,964
Pop.

712
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,662
Dad.

713
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,699
It's Michael.

714
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:10,318
As you are...

715
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,981
I was.

716
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,752
As I am...

717
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,693
you will be.

718
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,080
Mike's voice:
Maybe I'm not real.

719
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:51,619
Maybe I'm just
having a nightmare...

720
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:56,428
an incredibly vivid

721
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,900
lucid nightmare.

722
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:03,998
When is the last time
I remember going to bed?

723
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,277
I flew in yesterday.

724
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,711
Or was that... today?

725
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,685
I can't remember.

726
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,710
Was I on a train?

727
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,953
I woke up somewhere

728
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:25,052
and I had breakfast.

729
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,928
Where was I?
What did I eat?

730
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,395
Here it comes.

731
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:03,393
They say you can't die
in your dreams.

732
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:04,957
Is that true?

733
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:27,913
The shock
would wake you up.

734
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,521
So you couldn't
really die.

735
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:41,968
All right,
what are our options?

736
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,463
Got the hallway,
got guest rooms on either side,

737
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,602
stairwell,
fire exits.

738
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,408
And that's
the next window...

739
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,338
the next room.

740
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:58,276
How many feet across
is that?

741
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,982
One...

742
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:03,517
...three,

743
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,084
four, five,

744
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:09,155
six, seven, eight...

745
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,530
nine.

746
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,435
Nine, nine...
18 feet across.

747
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,335
Okay.
I can do this.

748
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:28,850
If something should happen,
if I should slip and fall,

749
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,048
I want it to be known
that it was an accident.

750
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,157
The room...

751
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:37,056
did not win.

752
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,222
Okay.

753
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:42,128
Okay, I can do this.

754
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,299
18 little steps.

755
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:55,244
Four...

756
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:57,678
Don't look down.
Five...

757
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:00,848
Keep moving.

758
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,120
Here we go.

759
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:15,492
All right.
Okay.

760
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,193
Number nine...

761
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:18,757
eight...

762
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:22,002
six...

763
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:28,377
Where is it?
Where is it?

764
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

765
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:06,768
Get ahold of yourself.

766
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:08,896
You're running to places
that aren't real.

767
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:14,903
Hotel rooms are naturally
creepy places.

768
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:21,846
Strangely, the bedroom
has no window.

769
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:26,113
Strangely, the bedroom has no window...

770
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:31,458
Woman:
Dr. Edwards to Oncology.

771
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:36,964
Lily:
Please, please.

772
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:46,804
No. No. Doctors don't
know everything.

773
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:48,811
We can get another opinion,
look for other treatment.

774
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:51,211
- You hear about...
- Look at me.

775
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,771
...miracle cures.
- Lily.

776
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:56,080
Oh God.
Please, something.

777
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:59,748
Mike: What kind of god would
do this to a little girl?

778
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,895
Katie.

779
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:14,096
Katie:
Daddy, I can't see you.

780
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:17,300
Daddy, I can't find you.

781
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,808
Daddy, I'm scared.

782
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Katie.
- I'm scared, Daddy.
Help.
Help me.
Daddy, help me.

783
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:07,119
Okay, how about
the wireless?

784
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:08,646
Come on.

785
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,330
Give me a signal.
Give me a signal.

786
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,699
Computer: Good evening, Mike.

787
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:23,271
Oh, yes!

788
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,406
Mike?

789
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,073
Mike, is that...
is that you?

790
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:32,843
- I can barely see you.
- Yes yes.

791
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:36,318
- It's like seeing a ghost.
- No no no. Yes, it's me.

792
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,183
- It's me. It's Mike.
- This is a little bizarre.

793
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:40,348
I mean, I haven't talked
to you in a year

794
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,448
and suddenly you pop up
in a box on my computer.

795
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:44,824
I'm sorry, Lily.
Listen to me, please, quickly.

796
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,455
Look, I'm at work, okay? So why don't
you call me at home tonight?

797
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:50,989
I'm trapped in this room,
this place.

798
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:53,228
Mike, you're always trapped in weird
places. That's your job.

799
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,134
No no, please, Lily. Listen to me.

800
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,002
- Please.
- Lily Enslin.

801
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,007
- Hi. Yeah yeah.
- Lily!

802
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,100
- I've got those. I'll be right down.
- No. Lily!

803
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,442
Lily, please!
Call the cops.

804
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,879
Send them
to the Dolphin Hotel.

805
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:07,644
I'll call you back.

806
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:12,414
- You're in the city?
- Yes!

807
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,946
- 2254 Lexington.
- What are you doing in New York?

808
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:18,427
I'll tell you later.
The Dolphin Hotel, room 1408.

809
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,429
- That's just perfect.
- Please.

810
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,294
You walk out, you disappear.
Leaving me what?

811
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,595
Not divorced. Separated?
I don't know, it's not clear.

812
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,364
- Suddenly you need me?
- Lily, I'm in a real bad spot here.

813
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:30,167
- I'm in danger. You understand?
- Okay, Mike. Slow down.

814
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:31,434
You're not making
any sense.

815
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,602
There's something trying
to kill me right now.

816
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,277
No, Lily!

817
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,443
No no no!

818
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:45,209
I've got a knife!

819
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,821
That's the way out.

820
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,924
Or that way.
Or that way.

821
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:09,131
All right,
that's the way out.

822
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:12,766
Lady, let me in!

823
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:16,539
- Help! Help!
- Please, sleep.

824
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,309
- Lady, I'm coming through!
- Mike!

825
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:22,511
Mike, can you help me?
Where'd you go?

826
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:25,987
Mike: I got to get some cigarettes.
You want something?

827
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:30,089
Jesus Christ!

828
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,923
Mike:
I've got to go. I'll be in California.

829
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:35,897
Mike, you can't do this.

830
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,162
She needs you.
She lost a kid too.

831
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,668
You've got an amazing talent
for stating the obvious, Pop.

832
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:41,931
You think
I don't know that?

833
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:43,962
I'm trying to talk
some sense into your head!

834
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:46,770
- Don't put your hands on me, old man!
- Mike!

835
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:49,937
Talk? Why change what appears to be
the habit of a lifetime, Pop?

836
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,412
You were always great
at passing judgment,

837
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,347
but the problem is
you never gave a shit.

838
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:56,317
I never gave a shit
because you're a bullshit writer!

839
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,221
Shit!

840
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:11,923
Hello!

841
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,399
Oh.

842
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Kevin O'Malley.

843
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:57,205
No.

844
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:59,214
No no no no no no.

845
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:02,841
I can't help you.

846
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,318
I can't help you.

847
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:08,381
No!

848
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:06,640
It's good to be back.

849
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:13,149
That's enough of that.

850
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:23,928
Alcohol.

851
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:28,027
I was just checking to see
if the accommodations

852
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:29,662
are exceeding
your expectations.

853
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,900
You know goddamn well
they are!

854
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,808
- What do you want from me?
- No no no.

855
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:37,176
What do you want?

856
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:39,909
What do you want,
Mr. Enslin?

857
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,611
- You sought this room.
- It was a job. I was doing the job.

858
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:44,676
- I beg your pardon?
- My job! I'm a writer.

859
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,689
Oh, that's right.
You don't believe in anything.

860
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,418
You like shattering
people's hopes.

861
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:50,755
Oh, that's bullshit!

862
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,556
Why do you think people
believe in ghosts?

863
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:54,961
For fun?
No.

864
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:58,433
It's the prospect
of something after death.

865
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:01,698
How many spirits
have you broken?

866
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,534
Mike's voice:
She was in so much pain.

867
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,631
Lily: I'm sure she's smiling down
on us right now.

868
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:08,643
What do you want
from me?

869
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:09,974
Huh?

870
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:13,038
What do you want
from me?

871
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:14,743
You...

872
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:17,048
you little...

873
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:22,649
What do you want?

874
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:24,682
What?!

875
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:31,530
I want my drink!

876
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:45,942
You win.
You win.

877
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:55,419
- Katie: Mommy?
- Lily: Hmm?

878
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:57,687
Katie:
Why is the Bible purple?

879
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:59,990
I don't know why it's purple.

880
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:03,487
It was a wedding present.

881
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:06,023
My grandmother brought it
all the way from Hungary.

882
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:07,695
Someday it'll be yours.

883
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,036
Are there people
where I'm going?

884
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:22,211
Hey, you're not
going anywhere, kiddo.

885
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:23,843
You're gonna stay
right here with us.

886
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,911
Daddy...

887
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,253
everyone dies.

888
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:32,190
When they're old.

889
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,820
When they're much older.

890
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,126
Okay, and then they go
to a better place.

891
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:39,157
And it's beautiful there.

892
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,133
And all your friends
will be there.

893
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:49,672
Is God there?

894
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:51,839
Yes.

895
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:55,347
Do you really
believe that, Daddy?

896
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,682
Yes.

897
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,181
Mike: You know what I think!
We should have done more!

898
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:04,886
- We did everything we could!
- No, we didn't!

899
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,191
- We should have helped her fight...
- Oh my God.

900
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:09,459
...instead of filling her head full
of these stories

901
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:11,762
about heavens
and the clouds and nirvana

902
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,631
and all that bullshit!

903
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:15,193
Those stories,
she like them.

904
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:17,068
I'm going to get
some cigarettes, okay?

905
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:57,931
Mike's voice:
We ponder the situation.

906
01:12:57,973 --> 01:13:01,306
I'm trying to
accurately describe...

907
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:05,206
Orpheus on
the Orpheum Circuit

908
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:07,238
bathed in tango light,

909
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:10,547
the kind of light
that makes the dead...

910
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,015
get out of their graves
and tango.

911
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:17,150
Now this is level nine...

912
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,363
the deepest level of hell,

913
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:25,163
furthest removed
from all light and warmth.

914
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:29,036
This is six.

915
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,699
It's goddamn five.

916
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,901
I think I see
the pattern.

917
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:37,207
Yes, I can see
the pattern.

918
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,645
Lily:
Mike.

919
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,843
Mike, can you hear me?

920
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:44,978
- Michael, where the hell are you?
- Lily.

921
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,817
Michael?

922
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:48,880
- Mike.
- Lily.

923
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,688
Michael, can you hear me?

924
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,217
Lily.

925
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:59,398
Oh my God. Thank God.
Jesus, I've been trying to get through!

926
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,596
- Did you call the cops?
- Yeah yeah, they're at the hotel.

927
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,662
- Didn't you say the Dolphin?
- Yes.

928
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:06,173
- You're sure?
- Yes yes, 1408.

929
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:09,234
Mike, they're in 1408.

930
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,109
The room's empty.

931
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:12,511
Mike?

932
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:16,240
Michael,
can you hear me?

933
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,809
Michael?

934
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:19,878
Michael,
where the hell are you?

935
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:22,618
I'm afraid I can't express
myself in this climate.

936
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:24,455
Calm down, okay?
We'll figure this out.

937
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:26,552
- Don't panic.
- I'm supposed to die here.

938
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:29,029
Michael, stop it!
You're not gonna die, okay?

939
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:30,998
Don't move.
I can be there in 15 minutes.

940
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:36,634
Mike?
Michael?

941
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:39,800
15 minutes
isn't enough time.

942
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:42,242
- It'll be too late.
- No, it won't be too late.

943
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:43,744
- Lily.
- Don't...

944
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:46,179
Actually, 15 minutes
is perfect.

945
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,342
It's perfect.
Just come up. Come now.

946
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:49,714
- Good, yes.
- I need you.

947
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:51,719
You've always been someone
I can count on.

948
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:54,779
I know we haven't talked a lot
since... since Katie died,

949
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:57,690
- but I need you, sweetie.
- Wait!

950
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:00,126
I can't explain it here. You just have
to come here and talk to me.

951
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,288
I miss you too, but...

952
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,059
When you get here,
don't talk to anybody.

953
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:04,497
Just come straight up to the 14th floor.

954
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:06,694
- Walk through the door.
- Shut up! Shut up!

955
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:08,862
- It's life or death, sweetie.
- Do not come up to the room!

956
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:10,599
- Okay.
- Don't come up to the room!

957
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,334
- I need to talk to you about Katie.
- Don't! Shut up!

958
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:14,433
- Lily, don't listen to him!
- Yes, good.

959
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:16,273
- It's a trick! Don't come up here!
- I'll be right there.

960
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:24,382
Lily! Lily!

961
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:59,185
Woman:
My baby! My baby!

962
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:03,220
Man:
She's heading for the rocks!

963
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:06,489
I don't want to die!

964
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,402
Man:
Oh God!

965
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:27,540
Man overboard!

966
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:34,582
Come on!

967
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,936
Are you okay, buddy?

968
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:00,635
Hey, are you breathing?

969
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:04,412
Man:
Come on, talk to me.

970
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,846
You guys,
give me a hand here!

971
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:17,551
Woman:
Dr. Edwards to Oncology, please.

972
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:25,155
Hey.

973
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,293
How are you feeling?

974
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,995
- Am I out?
- You're okay. You're okay.

975
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:32,336
Lie down,
lie down, lie down.

976
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,501
Lie down, lie down, lie down.
You're okay.

977
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,101
You're in the hospital.

978
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:38,305
Hospital where?
In New York?

979
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:39,779
New York?
No no, you're in LA.

980
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:42,784
You got hit on the head
with your board.

981
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:44,479
I can't believe
you still surf.

982
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,718
You flew here
just for me?

983
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:50,748
Yeah. Yeah,
I was worried.

984
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:52,987
They called.

985
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:55,553
I think I'm still listed
as your next of kin.

986
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:58,031
Okay, I'm not in New York.

987
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,534
- I'm out.
- Why do you keep saying that?

988
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:05,366
I was in New York.
I was trapped.

989
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:08,171
In New York,
I was dying

990
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:10,542
in this Kafkaesque hotel,

991
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,740
the Dolphin.

992
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:15,807
- What?
- The Dolphin Hotel on 45th and Lex.

993
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,409
- I spoke with you there.
- 45th and Lex?

994
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,613
- I called you.
- I've never heard of it.

995
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:25,749
You're gonna be okay.
You just need to rest.

996
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:46,476
Oh, we have a winner.

997
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,381
600 bucks.

998
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:04,391
Unbelievable.

999
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:06,593
I can see why
you live here.

1000
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,541
Why did you leave?

1001
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,574
Because every time
I looked at you,

1002
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,587
I saw her face.

1003
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,490
Lily:
I think it's pretty clear.

1004
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,399
I think in the dream
the room's your subconscious

1005
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:43,267
and it brought up
a lot of stuff.

1006
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:45,102
That's a good thing
for you.

1007
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,165
But this was... I mean, I was down
the rabbit hole.

1008
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:49,609
I was rattled.
I was shook up.

1009
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:51,509
And I can't shake it.
I think after dinner

1010
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:53,013
you should drive me
back to the hospital,

1011
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:55,949
check me into the psych unit.

1012
01:20:57,652 --> 01:20:59,745
You look really great.

1013
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,313
I can't believe
I'm sitting here with you.

1014
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,349
Tell me about it.

1015
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:07,588
Is everything all right?
Can I get you anything else?

1016
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:10,928
I'll have another
glass of wine, please.

1017
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:13,526
The same.

1018
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:17,294
Mike?

1019
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:18,966
Yeah, I'll have
another tequila...

1020
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:20,497
Patron, chilled,
double.

1021
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,100
Be right back.

1022
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:30,676
Katie was there.

1023
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:33,687
Mmm-hm.

1024
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,582
Can you imagine

1025
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:39,992
what it feels like
to have the sensation?

1026
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:42,053
I mean, the very
real sensation

1027
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:44,088
that I talked to her,
like, two days ago?

1028
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:46,896
I talked to her,
saw her, touched her.

1029
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:49,301
Yeah.

1030
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:52,033
I see her every night
when I shut my eyes.

1031
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:55,469
Yeah, but it was so vivid.

1032
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:58,604
It was so real.

1033
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:00,547
Maybe you should
write about it.

1034
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:03,176
About Katie?
Shit.

1035
01:22:03,218 --> 01:22:06,051
- You always were tougher than me.
- Why not?

1036
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:09,079
Seriously, it sounds like
you're ready to deal with this stuff.

1037
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:15,795
Can you stay?

1038
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:27,572
I'm sorry.

1039
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,840
Okay, we have got 148.

1040
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:37,374
148 is gonna be
right about...

1041
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:40,183
Uh-huh.

1042
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:43,281
So if you'd like
to sign on the line.

1043
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:47,227
Hey!
Hey, man!

1044
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:49,492
You've been
gone a while.

1045
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:52,466
Oh, by the way,
dude, I read your book.

1046
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:56,402
What is it?
"10 Most Haunted Motels," right?

1047
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:58,338
That's some scary shit.

1048
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:04,639
See you around.

1049
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:44,180
Did I drop a postcard?

1050
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:45,709
- What?
- Did I?

1051
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:47,278
- Huh?
- A postcard.

1052
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:49,916
No, I think I would
have seen it.

1053
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:54,188
But if I find it,
I'll put it in your mailbox.

1054
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:55,890
Okay?

1055
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:29,455
Mike: My experience in the room
was terrifying,

1056
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:32,989
a fragmented loop
of unease and despair.

1057
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:35,127
1408 was a horrible dream,

1058
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:39,766
yet somehow
I awoke from it renewed.

1059
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,208
Sam:
Mikey! You sound happy.

1060
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,006
- You're scaring me.
- I wouldn't go that far,

1061
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:46,536
but I must say that the work
is just pouring out of me.

1062
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:48,947
I think I've actually
reinvented myself

1063
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:51,850
in the form of a kind
of a fictional memoir...

1064
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:53,615
"Autobiography
of a Nightmare:

1065
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:56,123
Truman Capote meets H.R. Giger."
What do you think?

1066
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:58,955
I love it!
"'ln Cold Blood' with 'Aliens!"'

1067
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:01,325
That's sexy.
I wanna put it out to auction,

1068
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:03,853
start a bidding war.
When can I read it?

1069
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:06,731
Easy, tiger. Any day now.
You're gonna get it as soon as I finish.

1070
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:08,963
Okay, Mike.
Less talking, more writing.

1071
01:25:09,003 --> 01:25:11,494
Hey, where's that decaf?
I'm dying here.

1072
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:39,896
Thank you.

1073
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:55,039
Hey, Pop.

1074
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:05,790
How are you doing,
old boy?

1075
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:09,263
Can you hear me?

1076
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:11,492
I don't think so.

1077
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:22,703
I know I haven't been
here in a few months,

1078
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:25,508
but I just wanted to...

1079
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:28,277
come by and see
how you're doing and...

1080
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:33,880
tell you I was doing okay.

1081
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:37,517
Doing pretty good, actually.

1082
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:42,451
I started talking
to Lily again.

1083
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:46,194
And I wrote a new book,

1084
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:49,067
which I actually think
you would like...

1085
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:53,833
believe it or not.

1086
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:02,878
Michael.

1087
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:06,080
Dad.

1088
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,521
Michael.

1089
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:12,924
Yeah.

1090
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:16,158
Yeah.

1091
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:25,738
So...

1092
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:33,944
Man: Hey, you can't park there!
Move it down, will you?

1093
01:27:33,982 --> 01:27:37,383
Hey, I got a package
I need to overnight.

1094
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:40,581
Is this the right form? I got to get
this to New York by tomorrow morning.

1095
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:42,249
Man:
I'm sorry, sir, but we're closed.

1096
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:48,659
Very well.

1097
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:04,897
I was out.

1098
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,732
Is that Katie?

1099
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:11,432
Is that Katie?

1100
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:13,804
I was out.

1101
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:22,513
I was out!

1102
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:26,512
I was out.
Please, God.

1103
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:29,250
I know I was out.

1104
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:19,733
Yeah.

1105
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:26,677
Open it.

1106
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:45,196
Preacher:
...are yawning up widely in our path.

1107
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:48,896
We know the way
of the righteous man.

1108
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,865
Katie: Daddy.

1109
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:02,276
- Daddy?
- No.

1110
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:05,012
- You're not Katie.
- I need help.

1111
01:32:05,052 --> 01:32:07,782
Please.

1112
01:32:07,822 --> 01:32:09,153
You're not real.

1113
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,623
I'm cold.

1114
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:13,559
- You're not Katie.
- So cold.

1115
01:32:31,746 --> 01:32:33,373
I love you, Daddy.

1116
01:32:35,082 --> 01:32:38,245
Don't you love me anymore?

1117
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:40,550
Of course I do,
sweetheart.

1118
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:44,783
There we go.
I got you.

1119
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:48,421
I got you now, Katie.

1120
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:51,522
- Oh my God.
- They won't let me stay.

1121
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:54,126
- Yes, they will.
- They won't let me stay.

1122
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:56,033
- What?
- They won't let me stay.

1123
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:59,403
No no no no no. Nobody's ever going
to take you away again.

1124
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:03,274
I got you now, Katie.
Oh my God.

1125
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:05,074
- I'm not gonna let you go.
- Do you love me, Daddy?

1126
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:07,546
Of course I do. I love you more than
anything in the world.

1127
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:09,550
I wish we could
stay together,

1128
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:10,881
you, me, and Mommy.

1129
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:14,115
We can, we can.
I got you right here.

1130
01:33:14,155 --> 01:33:17,682
I got you right here, sweetie.
Everything's fine.

1131
01:33:17,725 --> 01:33:19,522
Everything is fine.

1132
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:38,706
No.
No.

1133
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:41,681
No. No.

1134
01:33:41,716 --> 01:33:43,650
You can't take her twice.

1135
01:33:45,586 --> 01:33:47,247
You can't.

1136
01:33:48,689 --> 01:33:51,658
Not again.
Please, God.

1137
01:33:51,692 --> 01:33:54,855
You can't.

1138
01:33:56,097 --> 01:33:58,122
Please.

1139
01:33:58,165 --> 01:34:00,133
No!

1140
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:01,998
No.

1141
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:05,028
- You bastard.
- # We fly #

1142
01:34:07,508 --> 01:34:12,639
# So many roads
to choose #

1143
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:18,243
# We start out walking
and learn to run #

1144
01:34:18,285 --> 01:34:20,480
# And yet
we've just begun... #

1145
01:34:31,298 --> 01:34:32,890
You little...

1146
01:34:32,933 --> 01:34:34,457
where is it?

1147
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,732
Where?!
Where?!

1148
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:10,266
# We'll find a place
where there's room to grow #

1149
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:14,707
# And yes,
we've just begun #

1150
01:35:17,945 --> 01:35:21,745
# Sharing horizons
that are new to us #

1151
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:28,411
# Watching the signs
along the way #

1152
01:35:28,456 --> 01:35:31,653
# Talking it over,
just the two of us. #

1153
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:24,341
Why don't you
just kill me?

1154
01:36:24,378 --> 01:36:26,243
Woman:
Because all guests of this hotel

1155
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,077
enjoy free will,
Mr. Enslin.

1156
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:30,811
You can choose to relive this hour
over and over,

1157
01:36:30,851 --> 01:36:34,116
or you can take advantage
of our express checkout system.

1158
01:37:05,286 --> 01:37:07,447
Mr. Enslin?

1159
01:37:50,998 --> 01:37:53,489
Are you ready to check out,
Mr. Enslin?

1160
01:37:56,637 --> 01:37:58,730
No.

1161
01:37:58,772 --> 01:38:00,933
- Not your way.
- I understand.

1162
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:09,078
By the way, Mr. Enslin,
your wife just called.

1163
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:11,744
She'll be here in five minutes
and we'll send her straight up.

1164
01:38:11,785 --> 01:38:14,117
She's not involved.

1165
01:38:14,154 --> 01:38:16,987
You can't have her.

1166
01:38:17,024 --> 01:38:19,822
I'm done arguing with you.

1167
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:24,393
I'm gonna end this.

1168
01:38:24,431 --> 01:38:26,456
Five.
This is five.

1169
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:29,492
Ignore the siren.
Even if you leave this room,

1170
01:38:29,536 --> 01:38:31,970
you can never
leave this room.

1171
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:35,874
Eight.
This is eight.

1172
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:39,175
We have killed
your friends.

1173
01:38:39,213 --> 01:38:41,738
Every friend

1174
01:38:41,782 --> 01:38:44,444
is now dead.

1175
01:38:54,628 --> 01:38:58,120
Mike's voice:
I lived the life of a selfish man.

1176
01:38:58,165 --> 01:39:01,566
But I don't have
to die that way.

1177
01:39:03,137 --> 01:39:04,536
If I'm going down,

1178
01:39:04,571 --> 01:39:07,734
I'm taking you with me.

1179
01:39:10,911 --> 01:39:12,879
This may not all be real,

1180
01:39:12,913 --> 01:39:15,575
and I may not even be real,

1181
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:17,914
but this fire...

1182
01:39:20,821 --> 01:39:23,153
that's got to be real.

1183
01:39:33,334 --> 01:39:35,097
Go to hell!

1184
01:39:57,458 --> 01:39:58,925
Get out onto the street!

1185
01:39:58,959 --> 01:40:00,984
Out the doors
and onto the street, please.

1186
01:40:01,028 --> 01:40:03,428
Everyone stay calm.

1187
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:09,761
- What's going on?
- Driver: I don't know, lady.

1188
01:40:09,803 --> 01:40:13,034
This might take a while.
Something must have happened.

1189
01:40:13,073 --> 01:40:15,439
Thanks.

1190
01:40:23,217 --> 01:40:26,516
Keep quiet,
you bastard.

1191
01:40:28,322 --> 01:40:30,153
Please, you've gotta help me.
No, help me.

1192
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,555
- Calm down.
- My husband's inside.

1193
01:40:31,592 --> 01:40:33,651
My husband's inside.
You've gotta help him.

1194
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:35,457
You've gotta help him,
please!

1195
01:40:35,496 --> 01:40:36,895
What floor?
What floor?

1196
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:39,057
14th floor, 1408.
Mike Enslin.

1197
01:40:39,099 --> 01:40:41,533
Please come here.

1198
01:40:41,568 --> 01:40:45,368
You're wasting your time.

1199
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:53,472
We're here
to do the job,

1200
01:40:53,514 --> 01:40:55,641
and we don't rattle.

1201
01:40:59,086 --> 01:41:01,816
The decor is in tatters

1202
01:41:01,855 --> 01:41:03,755
and the staff surly.

1203
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:06,726
But on the Shiver Scale...

1204
01:41:08,128 --> 01:41:11,393
I award the Dolphin
10 skulls!

1205
01:41:35,255 --> 01:41:38,122
Never kill
more than you can eat.

1206
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,128
Katie:
Daddy, everyone dies.

1207
01:42:20,834 --> 01:42:24,065
We commend to Almighty God
our brother,

1208
01:42:24,104 --> 01:42:27,164
and we commit his body
to the ground,

1209
01:42:27,207 --> 01:42:30,768
earth to earth,
ashes to ashes,

1210
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:34,372
dust to dust.

1211
01:42:34,414 --> 01:42:36,075
May you rest in peace.

1212
01:42:36,116 --> 01:42:37,913
Amen.

1213
01:42:37,951 --> 01:42:39,680
All: Amen.

1214
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,188
Well, they're together now.

1215
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:48,624
Let's go.

1216
01:42:56,069 --> 01:42:58,264
Olin:
Mrs. Enslin?

1217
01:43:02,609 --> 01:43:05,100
I...

1218
01:43:05,145 --> 01:43:07,511
I am sorry to intrude at such
a delicate time,

1219
01:43:07,548 --> 01:43:10,346
but I knew your husband.
I worked at the Dolphin.

1220
01:43:10,384 --> 01:43:12,352
Oh.

1221
01:43:12,386 --> 01:43:15,253
While we were cleaning up,
we came across some of his belongings.

1222
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:17,655
No, thank you.

1223
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:19,682
They are of such
a personal nature, ma'am.

1224
01:43:19,726 --> 01:43:21,853
- I figured maybe you would want to...
- No, please.

1225
01:43:21,895 --> 01:43:24,090
It's not how
I want to remember him.

1226
01:43:24,131 --> 01:43:26,531
I'm sure you understand.

1227
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:28,228
Oh yes, yes.
Of course I understand.

1228
01:43:28,268 --> 01:43:30,930
But it's important that you know
that he did a great thing.

1229
01:43:30,971 --> 01:43:33,166
He did not die
in vain.

1230
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:35,505
What are you talking about?

1231
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:37,703
Because of him,
the room won't reopen. It's been...

1232
01:43:37,744 --> 01:43:39,837
All right, okay, stop.

1233
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:42,713
Just give
the lady some air.

1234
01:43:42,749 --> 01:43:44,979
She's been through enough,
don't you think?

1235
01:44:29,730 --> 01:44:31,755
Mike:
Round one goes to the hideous Mr. Olin

1236
01:44:31,798 --> 01:44:33,095
for effective
aggressiveness.

1237
01:44:33,133 --> 01:44:35,567
I have to admit,
he had me going.

1238
01:44:35,602 --> 01:44:37,035
Get ahold of yourself.

1239
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:39,732
You're running to places
that aren't real.

1240
01:44:39,773 --> 01:44:41,297
Katie:
Daddy,

1241
01:44:41,341 --> 01:44:43,332
don't you
love me anymore?

1242
01:44:43,377 --> 01:44:45,504
Mike:
Of course I do, sweetheart.

1243
01:44:45,545 --> 01:44:48,105
- Don't you love me, Daddy?
- Of course I do, honey,

1244
01:44:48,148 --> 01:44:50,343
more than anything.
I got you now.

1245
01:44:50,384 --> 01:44:53,012
I got you right here, sweetie.
Everything's fine.

1246
01:44:53,053 --> 01:44:56,420
I got you, Katie.
Nobody's ever gonna let you go.

1247
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:58,253
Katie:
Daddy?

1248
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:01,352
Daddy!
Daddy!

1249
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Daddy!
Daddy!

1250
01:45:14,274 --> 01:45:15,832
Hey, sweetie.

1251
01:46:16,336 --> 01:46:18,497
Katie:
Daddy!

1252
01:46:18,538 --> 01:46:21,530
Daddy!

1253
01:46:21,575 --> 01:46:24,043
Yes, of course.
