1
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,440
<i>Catch them. </i>

2
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,360
<i>Kill them. </i>

3
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,920
What's wrong, Ronnie?

4
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,600
I love you, Jodie.

5
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,680
<i>Suffolk County police. </i>
<i>May I help you?</i>

6
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,320
<i>Everybody's dead. </i>

7
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>"everybody's dead"?</i>

8
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,520
<i>A guy come running</i>
<i>into the bar and says... </i>

9
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,920
<i>... his mother and father are shot. </i>

10
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,720
I've been to a lot of crime scenes,
never seen one like this.

11
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,280
<i>Six members of the family</i>
<i>were found last night... </i>

12
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,360
...in bed, shot...

13
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,240
...and killed.

14
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,840
<i>Killed were car dealer Ronald Defeo,</i>
<i>his wife and four of their children. </i>

15
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,560
<i>The sole survivor of the family... </i>

16
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,880
<i>... 23-year-old</i>
<i>Ronald "Butch" Defeo Jr... </i>

17
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,880
<i>... is said to have discovered</i>
<i>the bodies. </i>

18
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,960
<i>The police state</i>
<i>that for his own safety... </i>

19
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,200
<i>... they're holding him</i>
<i>in protective custody. </i>

20
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,000
<i>Five of the victims were found</i>
<i>shot facedown on their beds. </i>

21
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,240
The sixth was found in a closet.

22
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,440
No one seemed to stir in their sleep.
It's strange.

23
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,320
<i>Suffolk County police have charged</i>
<i>23-year-old Ronald Defeo Jr. </i>

24
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,400
<i>The accused told police</i>
<i>he heard voices... </i>

25
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,720
<i>... coming from within the house,</i>
<i>telling him to murder his family. </i>

26
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,800
Oh, God!

27
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,760
Damn it.

28
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,560
Hi, Michael.

29
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,480
Oh, hey, baby. You okay?

30
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,560
George, what are you doing
to my mom?

31
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,840
Nothing.

32
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,720
- Yet.
- You perv.

33
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,360
Come on up here, little man.

34
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,280
You can make it.

35
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,840
Oh, you're getting heavy.

36
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,080
Did you meet my dad?

37
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,880
No...

38
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,480
...never had the pleasure, pal.

39
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,520
Do I have to call you "Dad" now?

40
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,920
- Guess what.
- What?

41
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,880
- You can call me whatever you want.
- Anything?

42
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,920
- Yep.
- Cool.

43
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,920
- Anything.
- Cool.

44
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,640
Yeah.

45
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,040
- Stinky.
- Sure.

46
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,680
- Poopy-head.
- Yeah.

47
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,600
Crap-monkey-fart.

48
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,920
Okay, we gotta draw the line
somewhere, pal, that does it.

49
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
All right.

50
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,880
- This sucks.
- You're not kidding.

51
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,440
Billy.

52
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,720
Look, maybe we'll grab you
something on the way to school.

53
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,720
- What do you say, huh?
- I'm not hungry. I can walk to school.

54
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,320
No, you can't, and get
your feet off the chair.

55
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,960
I'll drop you a couple blocks away.
Nobody'd see.

56
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,000
- Mom, I'm 12 years old.
- Before you plan...

57
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,880
...your retirement party, we're gonna
drop you off at school.

58
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,920
We got a big day.

59
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,920
Why? Where are you guys going?

60
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,200
- Mom, can you help me?
- Oh, Michael.

61
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,000
Houses here are way out
of our price range, Kath.

62
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,800
Not according to this.

63
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,400
- Well, then it's gotta be true.
- Think positive, babe.

64
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,920
I'm positive that houses here
are out of our price range.

65
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,920
Look, when the business
is going good...

66
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,240
...we're gonna...
- There.

67
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,600
- What?
- That's it.

68
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
- Look.
- Honey.

69
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,280
Baby, look, 412 Ocean Avenue.

70
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,280
- It's beautiful.
- What?

71
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,000
Look at how friendly they are here,
honey.

72
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,600
They get like that when they think
they'll make a sale.

73
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,760
Let's just play it cool, Kath.
Kathy. Katherine.

74
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,920
Or not.

75
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
- Hi there.
- I'm Katherine Lutz.

76
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,320
Well, just call me Edith.
This is your husband?

77
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,840
- George.
- This is an amazing house.

78
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,880
You are going to love it.
Just follow me in here.

79
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,200
Careful on the steps there.

80
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Holy shit.

81
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,720
Excuse me.

82
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,160
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

83
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,240
This... This is a mistake.

84
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,640
How's that?

85
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,880
No, I mean your ad in the paper.

86
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,560
This is...

87
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,800
It's gotta be a misprint.
I'm a contractor...

88
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,280
...and I know what a place
like this should cost.

89
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,680
And, you know, if this is...

90
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,320
Well, if this is true, then this is a...
The deal of a lifetime.

91
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,760
And what is wrong with that?

92
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,280
- Come on.
- I love it.

93
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,040
- There's a vibrant history here.
- Vibrant history, George.

94
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,800
In fact, the house was built
in 1692, at least the basement.

95
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,680
The rest of the house was added
from that foundation.

96
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,240
It's one of the oldest Dutch Colonials
in Long Island.

97
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,720
Wow, that's impressive.

98
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,880
This room would be perfect
for children, if you have any.

99
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,960
And the view's...
Well, have a look for yourselves.

100
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,120
There's a boathouse.

101
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,200
Oh, all you need now
is a boat, right?

102
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,240
Actually, George has a speedboat.

103
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,080
This place sounds
like it's made for you.

104
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,920
And this is your basement.

105
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,120
As you can see,
it's very spacious.

106
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,800
It can be a game room,
a playroom.

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,720
Well, let's... Let's have a look.

108
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,200
I'll just wait up here.

109
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,720
Yep, looks like a basement.

110
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,840
So, what do you guys think?

111
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,120
- I think you look foxy in that skirt.
- Will you stop it? Come on.

112
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Yes, yes, okay?

113
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,560
It's a value. It's a value
for people with money.

114
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,720
Okay, look, if we do this, we're
gonna be eating dry wall for a year.

115
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,480
We deserve this, George.

116
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
You deserve this.

117
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,400
How many times you tell me
how hard you work for so little.

118
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,120
- Kathy...
- Maybe today is the day it all pays off.

119
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,920
- We'll make sacrifices.
- Huge sacrifices.

120
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,960
Yeah, I understand that.
Listen, honey...

121
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,280
...this is the life we want.

122
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,320
- We're happy?
- Yes, we're happy.

123
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,880
She's happy. I'm broke.

124
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,240
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

125
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,480
So look, I gotta ask,
what's the catch?

126
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,800
There's always a catch.

127
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,480
There was a tragedy, a crime...

128
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,240
...a murder.
- I'm sorry, what?

129
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,280
In the house?

130
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,480
Several people, a family.

131
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,920
But, you know, we've moved on,
the whole town.

132
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,680
It is a distant memory now.

133
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,560
And the house is fine.

134
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
Really.

135
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,920
Doesn't it seem kind of strange
to buy this house, honey?

136
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,200
Well, houses don't kill people.

137
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,600
People kill people.

138
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,720
Just... Excuse us.

139
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,480
Do you think we can make it work?

140
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,400
You know what?

141
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,880
You want it,
then we're gonna make it work.

142
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,080
- Really?
- I'll work out of the basement...

143
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,000
...and you can, well...

144
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,760
...sell one of the kids.
- Hey.

145
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,840
A little one.

146
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,960
We're rich! We're rich!

147
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,080
We're rich in something,
but it ain't money.

148
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,920
Wait.

149
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,720
- You say your prayers?
- Yep, said them twice.

150
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,560
- What did you pray for?
- Lf I tell you, it won't come true.

151
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,280
Why don't you tell him the truth.

152
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,840
- What?
- Praying doesn't do any good.

153
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,600
William.

154
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,200
Nobody answered me when
I asked for Dad to be kept alive.

155
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,120
Don't say that.

156
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,320
Sometimes things happen in life
that can't be explained, Billy.

157
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,720
Billy, look at me.

158
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,880
I need you to give George
a chance, okay?

159
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,000
You're not being disloyal
to Dad by liking George.

160
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,840
He doesn't want to be anything
but your friend...

161
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,160
...and maybe one day
something more.

162
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,640
Nobody will ever
replace your dad, honey.

163
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,600
For you too?

164
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,920
For me too.

165
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,400
How's Billy?

166
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,480
He'll be fine.

167
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,920
- First call.
- First call.

168
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,880
- Lutz residence, how may I help you?
<i>- Can I talk to my daughter, please?</i>

169
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,240
Yeah, sure, she's...
She's right here. Okay.

170
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,040
Your mother's gotta stop
gushing over me, seriously.

171
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,040
It's embarrassing now.

172
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,280
<i>Hello?</i>

173
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
- Hey, Ma.
<i>- Hi. </i>

174
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,400
No, we're all moved in.

175
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,480
- Yeah, Ma.
- Are you cold?

176
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,400
No, Ma.

177
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,080
Yeah.

178
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,120
- What is it, baby?
- Nothing.

179
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,640
- Are you okay, baby?
- No.

180
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,040
I don't feel well.

181
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,840
- Give me a kiss.
- I can do it, I can do it.

182
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No, you can't.
Come here, come here.
Honey, I'm gonna
make you some tea.

183
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,400
How many brothers and sisters
do you have?

184
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,880
- Chelsea?
- Hey, Mommy.

185
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,200
Hi, hon. Who are you talking to?

186
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,800
- The girl who lives in my closet.
- Oh, yeah?

187
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,160
- And what's her name?
- Jodie.

188
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,520
You know there are plenty of other
little girls to play with in town too?

189
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,840
I know, but Jodie says
they're all mean.

190
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,080
Is that Jodie?

191
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,920
No, that's someone else.

192
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,520
Who?

193
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,320
I'm not supposed to say who.

194
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,480
She says it's an A-hole.

195
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,040
You are not allowed
to say that word.

196
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,520
George, George.

197
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,600
- Look what I found.
- What is that? Where'd you find that?

198
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,960
Harry and I found it.

199
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,080
- Where?
- In the basement.

200
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,120
Not the basement.

201
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
My office.

202
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,320
You listen to me.
You don't go down there.

203
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,560
Understand?

204
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,520
Guys, would you help me
with the groceries?

205
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,680
Go on, go help your mom.

206
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,240
I'm sorry.

207
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,280
Go on.

208
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,040
- How are you feeling?
- Good, good.

209
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,640
I found a babysitter off a board
at the grocery store.

210
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,000
Billy will love that.

211
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,080
How about we call her
the young-adult-sitter?

212
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,840
Where's Chelsea?

213
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,360
Where's Chelsea?

214
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,320
Chelsea?

215
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,800
Chelsea?

216
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,960
Chelsea!

217
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,400
Chelsea.

218
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,960
Hey, give me your hand.

219
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,440
Give me your hand, sweetie.

220
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,880
- Chelsea, go to George.
- Come on. Hey, give me your hand.

221
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,000
What were you thinking?
You could have fallen in the water.

222
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,000
Jodie wanted to see the boat.

223
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Somebody should have been
watching you.

224
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,440
Billy, get up.

225
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,440
Billy, I gotta go pee.

226
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Chelsea.

227
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,240
Goddamn it, Harry.

228
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,960
Seriously. You trying to kill me?

229
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,040
Come on, get away from there.

230
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,960
Hey, that's enough.

231
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,000
Hey!

232
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,680
George? Hon, what are you
doing down here?

233
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,640
It's the only place
that's warm in this damn house.

234
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,800
Somebody keeps opening
the windows.

235
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What is that?

236
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,560
You tell me.

237
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,800
- Why don't you come back to bed.
- No, I can't sleep.

238
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,560
I'm sorry, baby.

239
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,440
Don't...

240
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,240
Don't talk to me like
I'm one of your kids, okay?

241
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,880
- What?
- That goddamn dog woke me up.

242
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,080
Billy's dog.

243
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,360
Found him in the boathouse.

244
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,000
- But you locked it.
- Yeah.

245
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,640
Hey, and guess
what I found in Billy's room.

246
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
You ready to talk
about those keys?

247
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,840
There's not a lot in this world can't
be solved with an apology, Billy.

248
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,320
I'm not apologizing
for something I didn't do...

249
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,720
...George.

250
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
Get to work, buddy.

251
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,520
"Get to work, buddy. "

252
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,720
"Katch 'em... "

253
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,400
George?

254
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,680
George?

255
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
George, you down there?

256
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,640
George?

257
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,240
What?

258
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,840
What's the matter?

259
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,080
Did you do that thing
with the magnets?

260
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,520
Nothing. Just seeing things,
I guess.

261
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You look hideous.

262
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,560
You're rather repulsive yourself,
Mr. Lutz.

263
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,120
- Where's the babysitter?
- Babysitter?

264
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,040
Told you guys,
I don't need a babysitter.

265
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,240
- I'm old enough.
- Baby, I know you can...

266
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,160
I'm not letting her watch us. She's
not coming in, I won't let her. I won't.

267
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,680
- She's not coming in.
- Billy, listen to me.

268
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,880
- I won't leave you alone.
- I can't believe you hired a babysitter.

269
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,560
- I told you I was old enough.
- Hi.

270
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,320
- I'm Lisa, the babysitter.
- Great.

271
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,760
Can I take your coat?

272
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,520
Okay.

273
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,080
Hi.

274
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,120
I'm Billy.

275
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,840
You sure you don't want
a babysitter?

276
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,000
Would you like me
to show you around?

277
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,400
No, it's okay.

278
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,120
I know it already.
I used to sit for the Defeos.

279
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,000
Kind of freaky being back here.

280
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,960
I'm Billy.

281
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah, I got you the first time.

282
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,840
Have a good night, Billy.

283
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,560
This is just what we needed,
don't you think?

284
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,280
Yeah. Definitely.

285
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,280
You feeling all right?

286
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,120
You know what?

287
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,040
I feel better.

288
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,320
I think I just needed
to get out of the house.

289
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,200
Come on, drink up.

290
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,200
Are you trying
to get me drunk, Mr. Lutz?

291
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,440
That's the appeal of marriage, hon.

292
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,360
Hopefully, I won't have to.

293
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,160
Be right out.

294
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,000
Hungry?

295
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Kid, you read my mind.

296
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,720
The kids, they're...

297
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,960
They're going through
a tough time.

298
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,400
I guess they're just
adjusting to everything.

299
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,520
Yeah, well, we all are.

300
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,160
Do you feel different?

301
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,120
What do you mean?

302
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,960
About us.

303
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,360
About me.

304
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,080
Yeah.

305
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,400
Yeah, I do.

306
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,280
I feel like for the first time in my life,
I'm sure about something.

307
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,880
And that's you.

308
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,640
And I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life making you happy.

309
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,080
Oh, boy, you know how
to turn on that Lutz charm.

310
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,840
Some people say his tongue is fake.

311
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,520
I think it's all him.

312
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,320
Got this at a pinball arcade.

313
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,080
Cool.

314
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,320
So do you French?

315
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,360
Do I what?

316
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,000
Kissing, tongues.

317
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,440
No.

318
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,120
Did your family know the Defeos?

319
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,560
- The who?
- The family that lived here before you.

320
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,520
No, we just moved here.

321
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,960
Well, you know what
happened to them, don't you?

322
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,240
No.

323
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,000
I really shouldn't be telling you this.

324
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,000
Your parents are gonna be pissed.

325
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,320
It's okay.

326
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,000
Stop. That's not how you play.

327
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,440
- I can't hear you.
- Stop it. Let me try.

328
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,520
You're killing him.

329
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,160
So this wack job, Ronnie,
the guy that lived here.

330
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,800
People in this town say
he heard voices telling him to do it.

331
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,080
The guy was a nut. I mean, first
he thinks his dog's out to get him.

332
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,560
So he kills it.

333
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,240
A few days later, he thinks his family
is a bunch of demons.

334
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,160
So you know what he did?

335
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,760
Wasted them.

336
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,640
How did he do it?

337
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,760
Do what?

338
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,400
You are way too young to hear this.

339
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,560
So cover your ears.

340
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,280
And don't listen.

341
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,160
A rifle.

342
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,520
He went room to room,
splattering their heads as they slept.

343
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,720
He killed his brothers
in this very room.

344
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,920
Right here.

345
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,840
In these beds.

346
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,920
It's kind of gross
you guys still sleep in here.

347
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,080
Actually, it's fucking sick.

348
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,840
Yeah.

349
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,960
I'm totally freaking you out, kid.

350
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,000
I suck at babysitting.

351
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,280
This was the little brat's room.

352
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,640
Jodie's.

353
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,840
You know, they found her in there.

354
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,040
- Jodie says you're a bad babysitter.
- Yeah?

355
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,400
Well, Jodie's...
What's the word? Dead.

356
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,440
Is not.

357
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,280
That little shit got me fired.

358
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,680
Dare you to go in there.

359
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,480
You give me your Kiss poster
if I do it?

360
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,000
Okay.

361
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,560
Okay.

362
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,880
You're going to make her mad.

363
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,320
Come on, guys.

364
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,840
Ha-ha, guys, this isn't funny.

365
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,360
Billy, Michael.

366
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,640
It's not opening. I can't open it.

367
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,640
- Unlock the fucking door.
- There's no lock.

368
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,440
This isn't funny. Let me the fuck out.

369
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,520
Billy, Michael.

370
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,560
Let me out. Let me out of here.

371
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,840
Let me out of here!

372
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,760
What's going on?

373
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,400
Let me out.

374
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,160
Hi, Lisa.

375
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,360
Look what Ronnie did.

376
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,680
Let me out!

377
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,240
Let me out of here!

378
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,640
Let me out!

379
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,120
Help me. Let me out!

380
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,880
I saw Jodie.

381
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,280
I saw Jodie.

382
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,920
Who's Jodie?

383
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,120
The little girl.

384
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,360
She's dead.

385
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,760
She's supposed to be dead.

386
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,600
- It's one thing to pull a prank.
- We didn't pull a prank.

387
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,160
- It's another one to hurt someone.
- It was this house.

388
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,920
Shut up!

389
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,720
- George.
- I got this under control.

390
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,640
You don't have you under control.

391
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,320
What you guys did was wrong.

392
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,920
Stop it, Kathy.
Whatever you're doing...

393
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,960
...whatever you're saying
doesn't work.

394
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,880
From now on, I'm doing the
disciplining around here, end of story.

395
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
This house is bad, Mommy.
Michael, honey.
There's no bad houses.
There's just bad people.

396
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,800
Why didn't you tell us
about the people who died here?

397
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,040
- Where did you hear that?
- The babysitter told me...

398
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,360
...that two little boys died
in our room.

399
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,800
Goddamn babysitter's an idiot.

400
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,520
Get to bed. We'll deal with this
in the morning.

401
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,840
No, I'm not sleeping in that room.
It's gross.

402
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,240
- Me neither.
- Wipe that stupid look off your face...

403
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,840
...and go to bed.

404
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,400
Run.

405
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,240
Why all the yelling, Mommy?

406
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,000
It's nothing. It's over now, baby.

407
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,440
I need you to tell me
what happened with Lisa, honey.

408
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,360
Lisa was being mean to Jodie.

409
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,880
So Jodie hurt her.

410
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,680
- Jodie.
- It's okay, Mommy.

411
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,440
Jodie won't hurt you.

412
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,640
She thinks you're a good mommy.

413
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,640
But the man who lives here...

414
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,160
...she says he's bad.

415
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,720
She wants him to go away.

416
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,360
He makes her do bad things.

417
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,440
Move it...

418
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,440
...from there to there.

419
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,880
Go.

420
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,080
And, Billy, don't come in
until you're finished.

421
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,600
What?

422
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,360
Is this discipline or torture?

423
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,600
Thought it was meat loaf.

424
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,240
When the body suffers,
the spirit flowers.

425
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,520
It's what my dad taught me.

426
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,920
His dad's not around
to teach him that, now, is he?

427
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,320
Billy, why is George such a jerk?

428
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,120
He's not a jerk. He's a douche bag.

429
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,480
And a weirdo.

430
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,400
And a doofus and a dipstick.

431
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,640
<i>Catch them. </i>

432
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,720
<i>Kill them. </i>

433
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,560
<i>Catch them. </i>

434
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,960
<i>Kill them. </i>

435
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,560
<i>Catch them. Kill them. </i>

436
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,120
<i>Catch them. </i>

437
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,120
<i>Kill them. </i>

438
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,400
Kill them.

439
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
- No! No!
- Look at me.

440
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,040
- No!
- What's the matter?

441
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,600
- God!
- It's me.

442
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,800
- It's me.
- God!

443
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,200
Baby, it's all right.

444
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,040
Do you use narcotics, Mr. Lutz?

445
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,320
No. But after this week,
I'm gonna give it...

446
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,240
...some serious thought.

447
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,920
Suffer from headaches, nausea?

448
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,800
Actually, I feel great now.

449
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,400
Weird as that may sound.

450
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,120
Well, there's no sign
of a concussion.

451
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,840
No sign of any bruising at all.

452
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,360
I want you to give Dr. Stone a call.

453
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,400
Wait, wait, wait.
This is a psychiatrist.

454
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,480
- Do I look nuts to you?
- I'm not trying to offend you here.

455
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm just trying to help you
figure out the problem.

456
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,720
I feel like it's my fault, George.

457
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,880
- Kath.
- I was the one who wanted this place.

458
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,320
- I put too much pressure on you.
- This is the life...

459
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,960
...that I want too, okay?

460
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,600
We got the old American dream here.

461
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
Okay? There's no way in hell...

462
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,800
...that I'm letting that get away now.

463
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,760
I love you, George.

464
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Billy, can I get my teddy?

465
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,440
She's real hungry.

466
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,480
Okay, go. And hurry up.

467
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,320
Mom finds out I let you out
of my sight, she's gonna kill me.

468
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,400
Hi, Mommy.

469
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,760
Look at me, Mommy.

470
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,320
Hi, Mommy.

471
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,520
Hi, Mommy.

472
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,720
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

473
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,080
- Chelsea.
- Chelsea, don't move. Just sit down.

474
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,680
Chelsea.

475
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,080
Chelsea.

476
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,760
Hold the ladder.

477
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,640
Honey, stay there.

478
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,440
Chelsea.

479
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,000
Chelsea.

480
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,360
- Chelsea.
- Goddamn it, Chelsea.

481
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,560
Which way?
Which way did they go?

482
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,520
Going left.

483
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,920
Chelsea.

484
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,600
What are you doing up here?

485
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,800
I have to go with Jodie, Mommy.

486
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,560
Baby...

487
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,640
...you come to Mommy.

488
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,840
No!

489
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,320
George.

490
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,520
- Hang on.
- Hurry.

491
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
George!
George, please, God, I'm slipping.
George!

492
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,120
George!

493
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,320
<i>Chelsea. </i>

494
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,640
What would you...?
Why would you do that?

495
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,840
Sorry. I'm sorry.

496
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,560
You can't do that to Mommy.

497
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,960
- Jodie wanted to show me something.
- There is no Jodie, okay?

498
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,960
- Yes, there is.
- No, there isn't!

499
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,920
- You have to stop this!
- Jodie's real.

500
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,280
- Jodie's real. She's...
- She is not real!

501
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,320
Liar! Liar!

502
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,080
Liar!

503
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,920
I've seen her.

504
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,120
She was gonna show me Daddy.

505
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,680
I just wanted to see Daddy.

506
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,840
Jodie promised to take me to Daddy.

507
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,360
She says I can stay here
so we can play together...

508
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,240
...forever and ever.

509
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,080
Do you miss your daddy?

510
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,680
Yes.

511
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,000
- Do you miss your daddy a lot?
- Yes.

512
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,920
I know you miss your daddy, baby.

513
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,840
But no one can see him because...

514
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,320
...he's in heaven.

515
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,080
He's with the angels.

516
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,720
He's with the angels.

517
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,840
I just got so scared.

518
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,560
What's the matter with you people?

519
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,040
Wacko family.

520
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,760
Father Callaway?

521
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,840
Father.

523
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,920
Hello.

524
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,360
Do you have a moment?

525
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,720
It's my family.

526
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,400
We've changed. It's...

527
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,680
It's like we've grown apart.

528
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,640
I don't think I understand.

529
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,200
There's something...

530
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,840
There's something evil in my house.

531
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,640
I know it sounds...

532
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,000
...crazy, I know that.

533
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,280
I would think the same.

534
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,840
I just don't know where else to go.

535
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,320
There was a family...

536
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,040
...lived here some time ago.

537
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,720
They had a similar problem.

538
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,280
The Defeos.

539
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,680
You knew them?

540
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,320
I'm living in their house.

541
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,440
Now, hold it steady.

542
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,440
Because if you get shaky,
I get shaky.

543
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,720
Go!

544
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,200
What, are you crying?

545
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,920
Why are you crying?
That wasn't so bad.

546
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,280
Pick up another log.

547
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,040
Hurry up, pick up another log.

548
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,760
Hurry up.

549
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,120
Put your hands up there.
Put your hands up there.

550
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,680
No.

551
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,680
Put...

552
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,520
We're friends.
We're having fun, right?

553
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,120
Put your hands up there.

554
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,120
Go!

555
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,040
Come here, little girl.

556
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,680
You're my favorite girl.

557
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,440

558
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,400

George.

561
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,840
I think there's something
seriously wrong here.

562
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,040
Something's not right.

563
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,200
What's not right?

564
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,200
We need to get out of here.

565
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,480
To just go. Just pack up and go.

566
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,920
No, no, no.

567
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,200
You know, you can't run away
from your problems, Kath.

568
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,720
Please, let's go, George.

569
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,320
- Somewhere. Anywhere.
- Did you hear that?

570
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,800
Do you hear that squeak?
I gotta fix that squeak.

571
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,840
Because, you know, these houses,
they're big...

572
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,240
Big projects. Kath, and you
can't just walk away from it.

573
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,280
How did you get so fucking stupid?

574
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,240
What?

575
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:21,040
Everything we have is in this house.
Everything.

576
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,120
I'm not worried
about our goddamn money.

577
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,720
Oh, our money.

578
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,960
George, we're losing each other.

579
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,960
Don't you see that?

580
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,120
We stay here,
we'll have a house for the family...

581
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,360
...only there won't be a family.

582
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's always so cold in here.
Would you let the stove alone
and pay attention to me?

583
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,920
I'm not going anywhere,
neither are you.

584
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,480
So shut up about that!

585
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,560
Just shut up!

586
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,360
Goddamn it.

587
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,080
You're the one who wanted
this godforsaken house.

588
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,520
Well, now you got it.

589
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,320
Mom! Mom!

590
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,640
Home sweet home.

591
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,680
What is it, sweetie?

592
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,040
We can't find Harry anywhere.
He's gone.

593
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,760
I'll help you look in a sec, sweetie.

594
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,880
You seen Harry, George?

595
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,480
No, I haven't, Billy.

596
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,000
Maybe he ran away.

597
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,560
Harry never runs away, George.

598
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,600
What's the matter with you, William?

599
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,240
Get out of here now.

600
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,360
- Now!
- Fine. Come on, Michael.

601
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,200
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

602
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,960
- Hello?
- Is your mommy home?

603
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,480
Hold on a second.

604
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,960
Mommy, there's someone
at the door.

605
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,600
Who is it, honey?

606
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,520
Come in, Father.

607
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,720
This is gonna sound strange...

608
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,520
...but you know the doll with one eye
that your daughter is holding?

609
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,840
Well, that belonged to the little girl
who lived here before you.

610
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,040
Yes, it was left here.

611
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,040
No, Mrs. Lutz, it was not left here.

612
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,080
Father, what exactly
are you trying to tell me?

613
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,680
I knew the Defeos very well.
I presided over their funeral.

614
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,680
Jodie Defeo was buried
with that doll.

615
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,120
Oh, heavenly Father.

616
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,680
Almighty God...

617
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,280
...we ask you to bless...

618
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,320
...and sanctify this house.

619
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:33,160
To bless all who live here...

620
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:38,320
...and to bring them the abundance
of all thy fruits.

Father!

624
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,000
Why are you leaving us?

625
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,320
What's the matter?

626
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,680
It's okay. I'm here.

Oh, goddamn it, Harry!

<i>Catch them. </i>

631
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,680

<i>Catch them. </i>

635
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,800
<i>There was a crime. A murder. </i>

636
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,440

he killed them all. "

Why did you run away
from my house?

650
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,400
Why did you abandon us?

651
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,160
Your house frightens me, Mrs. Lutz.

652
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,800
I just read about this man,
Ketcham...

653
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:07,440
...who tortured Indians on my land.
On my basement.

654
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,000
I read about how he slit his throat...

655
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,640
...so that his presence
would live forever.

656
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,040
Do you believe this could be true?

657
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,520
Ronnie Defeo came to me
weeks before the murders...

658
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:28,520
...and he spoke about hearing voices
and seeing things in the house.

659
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,240
I didn't believe him until yesterday.

660
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:37,440
Mrs. Lutz, get you and your family
out of that house...

661
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,880

Are you fucking crazy, George?

672
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,600
Have you lost your mind?

673
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,240
You tried to kill me.

674

01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,480
I'm down here, Mommy!

Chelsea, honey,
what are you doing down here?

677
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,760
I think she misses her daddy.

01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,440
Don't you?

679
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,520
Give me back my daughter.

I wanna talk to you. Wait.
I wanna talk to you!

Let go of my mom, you bastard!
Let go right now! Let go.

- What the hell is your problem?
- Let's go.
