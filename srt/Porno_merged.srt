2
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:22,078
Yes, big daddy, give it to me.
Give it to me, daddy. Yes.

3
00:01:42,432 --> 00:01:43,567
Whoa.

4
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:46,838
Dude, c'mon.
We're gonna be late.

5
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:48,406
Shut up, Todd.

6
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:50,843
What if they see us?

7
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:53,511
I can't get in trouble
for this again.

8
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:15,367
Ok! Fellas, let's go.
Hustle up.

9
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,174
Alright.

10
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,010
And now we pray.

11
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,946
Dear Lord,
we thank you for this day,

12
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,515
and for another opportunity
to serve you.

13
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:32,051
Please order our steps,
oh Lord.

14
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:36,090
Be a lamp unto our feet
and a light unto our path.

15
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:40,995
For the devil dwells
just below our feet.

16
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:44,564
We ask that you
watch over Todd, Lord.

17
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,433
Let him not fall
into temptation.

18
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:51,504
For if one of us falls,
others are sure to follow.

19
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:54,440
Lord, we ask that you
watch over Ricky

20
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,676
as he rejoins our flock,

21
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,615
and seeks a new purity
in your forgiving light.

22
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:04,986
Finally, Lord, we ask
that you guide Chastity

23
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,555
as she takes on the mantle
of Assistant Manager.

24
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,491
Ease her journey, Lord.

25
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,228
And let her know
that no amount of makeup

26
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:16,630
can conceal
her love of Christ.

27
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:20,834
We ask these blessings
in Jesus' name. Amen!

28
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:21,835
Amen!

29
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,572
Okay, team.
Let's have a great day!

30
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,014
Get busy, folks! Get busy!

31
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:10,153
Who's there?!

32
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:15,859
BOO!

33
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Dang it, Chaz!
I told you no horseplay
in the projection booth!
I was just bringing you
your drink!
- Shhh!
- Whisper.

34
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:30,640
- I asked for no ice.
- I forgot.

35
00:04:30,674 --> 00:04:32,709
It's the same thing every day.

36
00:04:32,743 --> 00:04:34,945
I never drink ice!

37
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,984
I hate this heavy metal crap.

38
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:41,786
It's not heavy metal,
it's hardcore!

39
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:45,857
It's hardcore.

40
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,625
Why does everyone call you
"Heavy Metal Jeff?"

41
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:48,693
No one calls me that!

42
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:50,029
Shhhh!

43
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,143
Dude! We gotta watch
<i>Encino Man</i> tonight.

44
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:05,245
I hear that Pauly Shore guy
is a real cut-up.

45
00:05:05,278 --> 00:05:07,247
"Heyyyy, buuuuuudy"

46
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,882
- I don't know.
- Dude, come on.

47
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:13,253
Ricky and Chaz are going to vote
for girl baseball.

48
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:14,254
You gotta back me up
on this one.

49
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:17,689
Dude! Madonna's
in a league of their own.

50
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:21,127
Did you hear about that book...
called "Sex"?

51
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:22,328
She wrote it.

52
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:23,730
Can you imagine?

53
00:05:23,763 --> 00:05:28,902
I wonder if she's, like,
doing it inside.

54
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:30,737
Or if it's mostly just boobs.

55
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,274
Exactly! That's why
we have to watch league.

56
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:34,375
Locker room scenes.

57
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:36,042
But, Abe, it's PG.

58
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:38,379
There's boobs in Jaws.
That's PG.

59
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:41,881
Yeah, but no... nips.

60
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,091
Just the essentials...

61
00:05:49,124 --> 00:05:51,992
Front door...
concessions...

62
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:54,895
supply closet.

63
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:03,971
Copies of everything are in here
just in case you misplace yours.

64
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:09,009
But you won't misplace yours
now, will you?

65
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:10,112
Nope.

66
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:17,052
Want a belt chain
like boss man's?

67
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:20,689
No.

68
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:24,960
Chastity.

69
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:25,760
What's up?

70
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:28,730
How do you think
Ricky's doing?

71
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,134
Great! He's, uh...

72
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,437
I mean, um... it's really good
to have him back.

73
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,973
It is, isn't it?

74
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:40,710
- Yeah.
- He's making awesome strides.

75
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:42,912
Critical strides.

76
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:46,115
I think it's important
that we support him.

77
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,718
A little bit of patience goes
a long way, don't you think?

78
00:06:50,753 --> 00:06:51,754
Yeah.

79
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,227
Don't lose those keys.

80
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:23,388
What movie are we
watching tonight?

81
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:26,192
Not that stupid caveman movie.

82
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:30,196
Sean Astin used to be cute,
but he grew up... weird.

83
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:32,498
I'm not watching
<i>A League of Their Own</i> again.

84
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:36,302
You already saw it?
Did you sneak in? Ricky...

85
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:40,439
No! I went yesterday...
with my mom.

86
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:50,250
You didn't go with Jasmine?

87
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:53,018
No. She hates baseball.

88
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:57,022
Hmm. Some girlfriend.
Can't wait to meet her.

89
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:58,891
Hey...

90
00:07:58,924 --> 00:08:01,026
Jasmine's awesome.

91
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,062
She's really on fire for God.

92
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:08,067
I smell cigs!

93
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:11,036
What the... hey!

94
00:08:12,506 --> 00:08:13,974
Do you want to
show up to heaven

95
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:16,377
smelling like an ashtray?

96
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:24,452
Oh!

97
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:29,055
You missed some trash.

98
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:42,704
Kids!

99
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:49,110
The work you guys put in
this week just has me fired up.

100
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:50,545
I'm so proud of all of you.

101
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,381
So we get to do
Friday night movie club?

102
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:55,116
Yes, sir! Just as soon as
you guys sweep the theaters,

103
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,118
you can put in
whatever movie you want.

104
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:58,953
Which one is it?
I gotta go load the projector.

105
00:08:58,986 --> 00:09:00,856
- <i>Encino Ma!</i>
- The other one.

106
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:02,525
I'm not sure we've all had
a chance to really discuss...

107
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:04,159
No! Pick now,
or I'm outta here!

108
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:05,193
Jeff!

109
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,830
I love your passion.

110
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:13,135
I love how you're
communicating directly.

111
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:15,037
But you have to remember,

112
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:21,176
when you feel like things are
getting outta control... CBTL.

113
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:27,917
Right. C-B-T-L.

114
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,153
CBTL.

115
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:32,389
Uh, what's CBTL?

116
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:43,866
Christ... Bears...
The... Load.

117
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:50,307
Decide amongst yourselves,
put it to a vote.

118
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:53,545
Jeff will play
whatever movie you choose.

119
00:09:53,578 --> 00:09:55,145
Make sense?

120
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,147
You have my word.

121
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,117
Jeff, I'll be back at midnight
to give you a ride home.

122
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,187
Chastity!
The theater is yours.

123
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:06,458
Have fun, team.

124
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:07,559
Come on.

125
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:45,998
Do you guys hear that?

126
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,028
Weird.

127
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:19,467
I don't remember selling
that guy a ticket.

128
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:23,103
I don't think
he watched the movie.

129
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:24,005
Someone would have complained.

130
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:26,274
I can smell the booze on him
from here.

131
00:11:28,276 --> 00:11:29,377
What should we do?

132
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,613
Hey.

133
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:33,381
What's that guy doing?

134
00:11:38,454 --> 00:11:40,656
Are you guys going to tell him
to leave or what?

135
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:46,327
Well, you're in charge, right?

136
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:49,198
Wimps.

137
00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:20,396
Excuse me, sir?

138
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:23,634
We're closed.

139
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,545
I'm sorry... you have to go.

140
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:43,420
NO DESTROYING PROPERTY!

141
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,359
Dang it! COME ON!

142
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:52,531
Okay.

143
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:04,142
What is that?

144
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:36,375
See, kids?
That's why I don't drink.

145
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,280
Guys, what is
this hole in the wall?

146
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:44,183
What does it look like, dink?
It's a doorway.

147
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:45,819
Wait, Jeff, did you know
this was here?

148
00:13:45,852 --> 00:13:48,388
Nope.
Never seen it before.

149
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:49,222
Well, what should we do?

150
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:51,593
That creepy old guy
is down there.

151
00:13:51,626 --> 00:13:52,694
We should call Mr. Pike.

152
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:53,728
No.

153
00:13:55,162 --> 00:13:59,399
No. No, wait.
Uh... Let me think.

154
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:04,471
Sorry, kids.
The longer we wait,

155
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:06,741
the more torqued up
this hobo's gonna get.

156
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:08,508
We only have one option.

157
00:14:10,612 --> 00:14:12,715
We gotta take out the trash.

158
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,502
Did you see the way he
just... burst through that wall?

159
00:14:34,535 --> 00:14:35,905
It was like he was possessed.

160
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:37,674
Telltale signs.

161
00:14:37,707 --> 00:14:38,775
Of possession?

162
00:14:38,808 --> 00:14:43,345
Addiction, Ricky.
First it controls your body.

163
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:44,681
Then it controls your soul.

164
00:14:46,382 --> 00:14:50,319
Guys, where are we?

165
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:51,420
Is this a basement?

166
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,291
Look.

167
00:14:57,794 --> 00:14:58,795
Whoa.

168
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:01,932
Are we in another theater?

169
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:07,637
What was that?

170
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:08,839
Was that him?

171
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:13,476
Okay. Let's split up.

172
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,645
You guys check that side,
we'll take this one.

173
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,749
You see him:
Bear tactics.

174
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,485
Raise your arms and yell.
Herd him back to the stairs.

175
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:24,923
Okay.

176
00:15:40,872 --> 00:15:42,440
Do you guys feel that?

177
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,554
Whoa.

178
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,353
What happened in here?

179
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,524
It looks like
there was a fire.

180
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,862
Maybe that's why
this was closed down.

181
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:35,997
Guys.

182
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:39,968
There's another room.

183
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,655
Bingo.

184
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:02,792
Crazy.

185
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:09,464
Maybe the cans
saved some of these prints.

186
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,567
Let's start digging.

187
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:22,812
Aw, man.

188
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:12,496
What's that?

189
00:18:22,107 --> 00:18:24,910
Ricky! Ricky,
are you guys okay?

190
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:26,510
Wha-what happened?

191
00:18:27,946 --> 00:18:29,814
Guys, look!

192
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:33,919
Let's rock.

193
00:18:35,854 --> 00:18:36,923
Did you throw him out?

194
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:40,059
Nope. The door was swinging
when I got up here.

195
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:41,727
Where do you think he went?

196
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,931
Roaming.
Searching for a fix.

197
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:46,632
He thinks he's doing the drugs,

198
00:18:46,665 --> 00:18:50,103
but brother,
those drugs are doing him.

199
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,572
Alright, kids.
The show's over.

200
00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:58,610
Now...
what are we gonna watch?

201
00:18:59,746 --> 00:19:00,813
How about this one?

202
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:04,051
Whoa.

203
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:08,688
You found this
in the basement?

204
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:10,925
- What is it?
- Not <i>Encino Man.</i>

205
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,492
- I'm in.
- No way!

206
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:14,094
I'm not putting this junk
in my projector.

207
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:15,461
C'mon, man.
Don't be such a narc!

208
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:16,596
Shut it, perv!

209
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:19,199
If this was locked up
downstairs, it was for a reason.

210
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:20,767
You want to get in trouble
again?

211
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,875
Dude, we're not
gonna get in trouble.

212
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:29,110
Ricky's in.

213
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:33,681
I'm in too.

214
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,482
Four against one!
We're watching it.

215
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:38,686
No way! You guys
are gonna have to kill me.

216
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,956
Mr. Pike told you
to play whatever we choose.

217
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:42,190
And we've chosen.

218
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,724
Rules are rules,
Heavy Meta Jeff.

219
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:44,792
That's not my name, dingus.

220
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,161
You gave your word, Jeff.

221
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:47,696
You don't want me
to tell Mr. Pike

222
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,831
that you broke your word,
do you?

223
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:49,889
Is this an art film?

224
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:53,793
I don't know, dude.

225
00:21:53,827 --> 00:21:55,795
I do not know.

226
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:45,814
Oh... my...

227
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:49,951
Hey, what the frick?!

228
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:53,889
No! That's it!
Show is over, folks.

229
00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:55,790
C'mon, man.
It was just getting good.

230
00:22:55,824 --> 00:22:58,227
I am not breaking my edge
for your European titty movie.

231
00:22:58,261 --> 00:22:59,429
Don't be such a prude, Jeff.

232
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:01,198
No. He's right.

233
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:02,166
What?

234
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:04,767
This is pornography, Chaz.
This is a sin.

235
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,702
It's not pornography.
It's art.

236
00:23:06,736 --> 00:23:07,837
I feel weird.

237
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,373
Yeah, me too.

238
00:23:09,406 --> 00:23:11,408
You bet you do.

239
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:15,144
You see, the science of porn
is well known.

240
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,448
The human brain,
when aroused by erotic images,

241
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,149
dumps chemicals
into the bloodstream,

242
00:23:20,184 --> 00:23:22,118
which send the viewer
into full throttle

243
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,755
"give me more" mode.

244
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:25,756
You know, that's...
that's right.

245
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:28,792
And we may think
that we're just being curious,

246
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:32,297
but that will turn
into an obsession.

247
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,997
Besides,
what would Mr. Pike think

248
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:34,998
if he caught us doing this?

249
00:23:35,032 --> 00:23:37,368
Oh, he'd definitely blame me.

250
00:23:37,402 --> 00:23:39,504
I'm the one that's supposed
to be responsible here.

251
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:43,173
No. I'm the one who brought
the print upstairs.

252
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,876
This is my fault.
And Ricky's right.

253
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:47,413
If we let ourselves
fall into temptation,

254
00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:49,381
who knows
what it'll lead to?

255
00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:52,116
Some of us know
what it will lead to.

256
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,353
Right, Todd?

257
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:57,256
Wait, where's Todd?

258
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:00,359
<i>THE WILDCARD!</i>

259
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:03,194
<i>You little perv!</i>

260
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:17,277
<i>Todd! Open the door,
Todd! Open it!</i>

261
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,300
<i>TODD!</i>

262
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:44,597
Real smooth, dingleberry.
It's jammed.

263
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,465
I didn't do anything.
I just hit 'Play'.

264
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:49,968
It's not a VCR.
You can't just hit 'Play'.

265
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:51,202
See?

266
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:54,139
This is why amateurs shouldn't
mess with serious equipment.

267
00:26:54,172 --> 00:26:56,941
Well, we're all beefed
if Mr. Pike comes back

268
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:58,243
and that dirty movie
is in the projector.

269
00:26:58,276 --> 00:27:00,647
No. I cannot get in trouble
for this again.

270
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,481
My dad will send me away.

271
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:03,249
Todd, don't worry
about it, man.

272
00:27:03,282 --> 00:27:04,083
It's gonna be fine.

273
00:27:04,116 --> 00:27:05,452
If I have to call
the repair guy,

274
00:27:05,485 --> 00:27:06,919
I'm gonna tell him
who's responsible.

275
00:27:07,721 --> 00:27:09,556
What the heck, dude?

276
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,026
I got it.

277
00:27:16,095 --> 00:27:17,296
You moron!

278
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:22,134
Get that filth
out of my booth!

279
00:27:25,706 --> 00:27:28,275
<i>That was the craziest
thing I've ever seen.</i>

280
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:29,644
I know.

281
00:27:29,677 --> 00:27:33,113
Do you think that's how
all pornography is?

282
00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:35,583
I don't know.

283
00:27:35,616 --> 00:27:38,018
We definitely shouldn't have
watched it, that's for sure.

284
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:57,972
What is this place?

285
00:28:00,676 --> 00:28:01,677
It's fine.

286
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,681
It's just a bunch of old junk.

287
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:16,693
Okay.

288
00:28:16,726 --> 00:28:19,027
Let's just put this away

289
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:20,597
so we can get
the heck out of here.

290
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:34,309
It was right over there.

291
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:36,346
Yeah.

292
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:42,820
Okay, let's go.

293
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:45,288
Can I ask you something first?

294
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:46,322
Yeah.

295
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:52,195
You never wrote me
a letter this summer.

296
00:28:52,228 --> 00:28:53,129
What?

297
00:28:53,162 --> 00:28:55,733
You said you would write me...
from camp?

298
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:59,203
Oh, uh, yeah... um...

299
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:03,474
Look, it was just...
really intense.

300
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,280
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, it's no big deal.

301
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:11,081
I mean, it's not like
I checked the mail every day

302
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:12,584
like some dope.

303
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,221
- Chaz...
- Really. It's totally cool.

304
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:20,157
Trish's cousin Alex
visited for a few weeks

305
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,194
and he brought all these
mixtapes with him. Goth music.

306
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,698
And we pretty much
just drove around

307
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:28,400
in her mom's Aerostar,
pumping jams.

308
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,103
It was amazing.

309
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,606
Your dad let you do that?

310
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,209
I don't have to ask
permission for everything.

311
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,378
I didn't ask if I could
wear this eyeliner.

312
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:43,683
I didn't ask if I could listen
to The Cure. And, and...

313
00:29:43,716 --> 00:29:46,820
I didn't ask
if I could kiss Alex.

314
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:50,556
I just did those things
because, who cares? Right?

315
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:52,291
It's not like someone's
out there missing me

316
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:53,760
or wondering what I'm doing.

317
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,302
Alex, huh?

318
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:07,774
Was he a good kisser?

319
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:13,313
You're such an idiot.

320
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:32,863
Hello?

321
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:37,500
Mr. Pike's going to
explode my nuts

322
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:38,769
if I can't get this fixed.

323
00:31:38,803 --> 00:31:40,004
Explode your nuts?

324
00:31:40,037 --> 00:31:41,839
- Is that a thing?
- It happens, man.

325
00:31:41,872 --> 00:31:44,240
My dad was in 'Nam.
He says he saw it all the time.

326
00:31:47,545 --> 00:31:49,480
Cheese and rice!

327
00:31:51,817 --> 00:31:53,819
I can't believe that degenerate
broke my projector.

328
00:31:53,852 --> 00:31:55,386
Lay off him, man.

329
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:56,420
Abe...

330
00:31:57,823 --> 00:31:59,690
You seem like a good kid.

331
00:31:59,725 --> 00:32:01,225
But Todd is a verified pervert.

332
00:32:01,893 --> 00:32:02,928
You shouldn't be
hanging out with him.

333
00:32:02,961 --> 00:32:04,196
Who died and made you
role model?

334
00:32:04,228 --> 00:32:06,932
Didn't you drop out of college
and move back in with your mom?

335
00:32:06,965 --> 00:32:10,368
You think you know
everything, don't you?

336
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:11,738
But listen up.

337
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:14,639
'Cause maybe you'll learn
a thing or two.

338
00:32:14,673 --> 00:32:16,508
That college
was sucking away my money

339
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:19,277
and pumping me
full of secular propaganda.

340
00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:21,047
With all the dough I'm saving
living at home,

341
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,448
I'm gonna buy
a brand-new drum kit.

342
00:32:23,482 --> 00:32:24,817
Then I'm going to
get my band back together

343
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:26,853
and we are gonna thrash
harder than ever.

344
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:28,855
Yeah, I'm sure God loves
your crappy heavy metal.

345
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:29,922
It's not heavy metal.

346
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,992
Besides, what are you
doing with your life

347
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:34,962
that makes you
so special, anyway?

348
00:32:36,797 --> 00:32:37,931
Exactly.

349
00:32:58,051 --> 00:33:01,055
This is a... weird movie.

350
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:08,897
Something's not right.

351
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:17,771
"The demon can only be
summoned or dispatched

352
00:33:17,806 --> 00:33:20,909
"via the sacred instruments...

353
00:33:20,942 --> 00:33:23,478
"Only in its true form.

354
00:33:24,646 --> 00:33:26,614
...it's true form."

355
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:27,917
<i>What is that?</i>

356
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:33,956
It's a book.

357
00:33:33,989 --> 00:33:36,624
Look, Chaz... I'm sorry.

358
00:33:36,658 --> 00:33:37,625
Whatever.

359
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:39,627
Hey! Don't be like that.

360
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,999
I just don't get
what's going on with you.

361
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:46,735
Growing up, all you talked about
was baseball.

362
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:48,804
Leaving town,
playing for the majors...

363
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:51,842
If that's not what you want,

364
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,809
then what do you actually want?

365
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:00,984
What does that look like
to you?

366
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,422
I don't care about that book.

367
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:07,656
Talk to me.

368
00:34:15,665 --> 00:34:16,700
What is that?

369
00:34:21,638 --> 00:34:23,406
Okay...

370
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,741
Let's get out of here.

371
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:27,677
Wait, I thought
you propped this open.

372
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:28,678
I did.

373
00:34:28,712 --> 00:34:29,813
I promise.

374
00:34:32,482 --> 00:34:33,516
No!

375
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:36,088
Hello?

376
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:38,522
Hello?

377
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:39,757
Who's out there?

378
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,525
Todd!

379
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,728
Stop messing around.
Open up!

380
00:34:58,077 --> 00:34:59,478
Guys?

381
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:41,587
Ten foot... hole?

382
00:36:04,678 --> 00:36:05,981
What the...

383
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:31,539
Oh...

384
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:34,011
my...

385
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:46,289
God...

386
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,382
Weird.

387
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:46,752
Where's Todd? I mean,
he should be back by now.

388
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:48,388
He's probably wankin' it,
thinkin' about that titty movie.

389
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:49,721
He'd never do that.

390
00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:51,357
Todd's a spaz,
but he's not a perv.

391
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:52,724
The cops found him in a tree

392
00:37:52,758 --> 00:37:53,792
with a pair of binoculars...

393
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:55,060
- You don't know that.
- ...peeping on some lady.

394
00:37:55,095 --> 00:37:56,628
It was in the paper, bro!

395
00:37:56,662 --> 00:37:57,696
Facts are facts.

396
00:37:57,729 --> 00:37:59,399
Dude!

397
00:37:59,432 --> 00:38:00,732
Shut up.

398
00:38:02,435 --> 00:38:03,236
Abe!

399
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:07,273
Come back here
and pick this stuff up.

400
00:38:09,175 --> 00:38:10,211
<i>Todd!</i>

401
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:12,912
Todd.

402
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:15,048
<i>Abe!</i>

403
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:18,252
Wait up, man.

404
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:47,014
Figures.

405
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:49,984
Todd!

406
00:38:57,057 --> 00:38:59,162
Dude, you're gonna have
to give him mouth to mouth.

407
00:38:59,195 --> 00:39:00,463
He's breathing, you cretin.

408
00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:02,298
Todd.

409
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:04,267
You okay, man?
What happened?

410
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,800
I-I saw her.

411
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:07,035
You saw who?

412
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:10,206
Well, who'd you see, Todd?

413
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,307
Her.

414
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,741
Dude.

415
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:14,910
He peed his pants.

416
00:39:16,512 --> 00:39:19,282
Abe, I don't think
it's pee, man.

417
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,283
It's not.

418
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,984
What are you talking about?

419
00:39:22,018 --> 00:39:23,786
The woman...
the woman from the film.

420
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:24,921
She was here.

421
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:26,122
I saw her...

422
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,491
Her hooters, man.

423
00:39:27,524 --> 00:39:29,293
- And everything else.
- Yeah, right.

424
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,127
The only naked lady
you've ever seen is your mom.

425
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,128
My mom's dead, freak.

426
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,363
Prove it!

427
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:38,402
What was that?

428
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:46,810
What the...

429
00:40:00,891 --> 00:40:02,260
Careful, Heavy Metal Jeff.

430
00:40:03,294 --> 00:40:06,231
Don't break your edge.

431
00:40:06,264 --> 00:40:07,798
Forget it, loser.

432
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:10,935
I'm not popping wood
for this trash.

433
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:26,985
Dang it.

434
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:30,489
You find anything back there?

435
00:40:30,522 --> 00:40:32,324
<i>Calm down, I'm looking.</i>

436
00:41:16,504 --> 00:41:18,004
What the heck?

437
00:41:29,484 --> 00:41:30,585
Who's there?

438
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:52,040
Ricky?

439
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,588
What? What happened?

440
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:38,556
Were-were-were you
just in there with me?

441
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,557
Was that you?

442
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:42,926
- What?
- I... I saw... I saw, um...

443
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,529
I touched your, uh...

444
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,268
Chastity, stop!

445
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:54,238
I don't want you.

446
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,272
What?

447
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,176
I mean...

448
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:00,546
...because of Jasmine,
you know.

449
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,180
And Mr. Pike, he said...

450
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:03,281
Ricky, shut up!

451
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,420
I think someone's
in here with us.

452
00:43:07,453 --> 00:43:08,454
What?

453
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:14,292
This is what I saw in there.

454
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:20,331
- Abe!
- Let us out!

455
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:21,967
Todd!

456
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:23,169
Listen...

457
00:43:23,202 --> 00:43:25,304
Clearly, you saw one of
these titty posters

458
00:43:25,337 --> 00:43:27,373
and you thought
it was a real woman.

459
00:43:27,406 --> 00:43:29,743
All these porn chemicals
running around in your brain,

460
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:32,111
giving you hallucinations
and whatnot...

461
00:43:32,144 --> 00:43:34,748
It's totally typical
of satanic takeover of the mind.

462
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:36,248
<i>It's not porn chemicals.</i>

463
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:37,684
<i>I saw her.</i>

464
00:43:39,185 --> 00:43:40,654
You believe me, right?

465
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:42,288
Maybe you got confused?

466
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:43,088
Abe...

467
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:46,727
Abe, please.
I saw her bush, man.

468
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:48,061
Guys...

469
00:43:49,062 --> 00:43:50,197
Look at this photo.

470
00:43:51,198 --> 00:43:52,567
Who does this look like?

471
00:43:58,171 --> 00:43:59,674
<i>It's that old boozer.</i>

472
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:03,243
<i>But, when was this taken?</i>

473
00:44:03,276 --> 00:44:05,613
- <i>Abe, Todd.</i>
- <i>Todd.</i>

474
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:06,614
You guys hear that?

475
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:09,416
<i>Get us outta here.</i>

476
00:44:09,449 --> 00:44:13,187
- Help! Abe! Open up!
- Help! Jeff! Todd!

477
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:20,529
What were you two
doing in here so long?

478
00:44:20,562 --> 00:44:22,263
We got stuck.

479
00:44:22,296 --> 00:44:24,700
Didn't you a-holes hear us
screaming and pounding?

480
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:26,367
Screaming and pounding, huh?

481
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,368
Shut up, Todd.

482
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:29,270
Shut up, everybody.

483
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:32,106
We gotta get out of here.

484
00:44:42,752 --> 00:44:44,453
No!

485
00:44:44,486 --> 00:44:45,454
What?

486
00:44:45,487 --> 00:44:46,523
Someone took my keys.

487
00:44:46,556 --> 00:44:47,624
Did you lock us in here?

488
00:44:47,657 --> 00:44:49,258
No, I left them
in the door.

489
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:50,660
Okay, that's it, knuckleheads.

490
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:52,494
Turn out your pockets.

491
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:53,362
Wait.

492
00:44:53,395 --> 00:44:56,331
There are copies
in Mr. Pike's office.

493
00:44:56,365 --> 00:44:57,668
It's the woman from the film.

494
00:44:57,701 --> 00:44:59,502
- She's here.
- What did you say?

495
00:44:59,537 --> 00:45:01,304
Todd! Shhh.

496
00:45:01,337 --> 00:45:03,506
No, no, no.
We gotta get outta here.

497
00:45:07,645 --> 00:45:09,479
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

498
00:45:09,512 --> 00:45:11,481
I can't let you do that, buddy.

499
00:45:11,514 --> 00:45:13,651
It's a violation
of employee policy...

500
00:45:13,684 --> 00:45:15,619
on destroying company property.

501
00:45:16,887 --> 00:45:18,421
Okay?

502
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:19,657
It's in the handbook.

503
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,190
Alright? Use your head.

504
00:45:24,261 --> 00:45:25,664
Okay, guys.

505
00:45:25,697 --> 00:45:26,698
Look...

506
00:45:28,399 --> 00:45:30,301
There ain't no movie woman.

507
00:45:32,202 --> 00:45:33,772
If you ask me...

508
00:45:33,805 --> 00:45:36,841
it's that creepy old dude.

509
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:39,243
I think he used to
own the place.

510
00:45:39,276 --> 00:45:41,178
And now he's back.

511
00:45:41,211 --> 00:45:46,719
Under the influence,
and a perv to boot.

512
00:45:46,752 --> 00:45:52,157
Someone like that
is capable of anything.

513
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:53,325
Boys...

514
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,762
it's time to ante up.

515
00:46:02,935 --> 00:46:04,502
Forget that.

516
00:46:04,536 --> 00:46:07,238
Let's get the keys
and get out of here.

517
00:46:07,272 --> 00:46:08,608
The lady from the film
is here,

518
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:09,610
I'm telling you.

519
00:46:09,643 --> 00:46:10,844
It just sounds crazy, Todd.

520
00:46:10,877 --> 00:46:12,411
Why can't you
back me up on this?

521
00:46:12,445 --> 00:46:13,279
Just this once.

522
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,513
Right or wrong,
I always stick by you.

523
00:46:14,547 --> 00:46:17,216
You two losers sound
like an old married couple.

524
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:18,885
- Shut up, Heavy Metal Jeff!
- Shut up, Heavy Metal Jeff!

525
00:46:18,919 --> 00:46:19,820
<i>Guys!</i>

526
00:46:40,808 --> 00:46:42,476
Look.

527
00:46:48,248 --> 00:46:49,616
You put that dirty movie
on again?

528
00:46:49,651 --> 00:46:50,852
No way!

529
00:46:50,885 --> 00:46:52,654
We put it back
where we found it.

530
00:47:28,524 --> 00:47:29,793
Nope, I'm outta here.

531
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,282
- Office!
- What was that?

532
00:47:52,315 --> 00:47:53,650
Was that the projector?

533
00:47:57,387 --> 00:47:58,421
Oh no.

534
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:03,326
Dope fiend with a fistful
of keys and nothing to lose?

535
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,796
It's grandpa's party now.

536
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:07,297
Barricade that door.

537
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:29,988
What's in here?

538
00:48:30,021 --> 00:48:32,023
A rifle.

539
00:48:32,057 --> 00:48:33,125
Are you serious?

540
00:48:33,158 --> 00:48:35,360
That's what Mr. Pike told me
when I was training.

541
00:48:35,393 --> 00:48:36,394
He was showing me
around the office

542
00:48:36,428 --> 00:48:37,997
and when I asked him
what was in the cabinet...

543
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:40,365
- He pulled out a gun?
- I don't buy it.

544
00:48:40,398 --> 00:48:41,868
No. He didn't pull it out.

545
00:48:41,901 --> 00:48:42,869
He just said
I never had to worry

546
00:48:42,902 --> 00:48:44,804
because he was watching out
for everybody.

547
00:48:48,573 --> 00:48:49,976
What... what was that?

548
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:55,580
Guys...

549
00:48:56,783 --> 00:48:57,818
Where's Todd?

550
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,686
He didn't come in here
with us?

551
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,722
Well, he's still out there.

552
00:49:02,755 --> 00:49:05,324
- Move this stuff!
- Wait, maybe it's Mr. Pike.

553
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:06,592
It's not midnight yet!

554
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,062
It's hobo fever.

555
00:49:12,933 --> 00:49:14,802
Let's smoke this junkie.

556
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:38,659
What's this?

557
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:47,769
What is this for?

558
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,841
To clean his gun?

559
00:49:51,874 --> 00:49:53,876
What gun?

560
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:55,010
Weird.

561
00:49:57,645 --> 00:49:59,014
- Whoa.
- What is it?

562
00:50:01,984 --> 00:50:04,552
We shouldn't have
opened this cabinet.

563
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:05,988
This is... is private.

564
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,826
Give it.
I want to see.

565
00:50:10,861 --> 00:50:11,962
Give it to me.

566
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:19,568
I don't get it.

567
00:50:22,906 --> 00:50:24,373
Wait, what?

568
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:28,144
Oh, my gosh.

569
00:50:28,178 --> 00:50:30,947
What?
Abe, hook it to the TV.

570
00:50:32,048 --> 00:50:33,150
No.

571
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:40,757
Do it.

572
00:51:19,764 --> 00:51:21,067
What the H?

573
00:51:23,269 --> 00:51:24,569
Turn it off.

574
00:51:26,805 --> 00:51:28,607
Turn it off now!

575
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,044
Mr. Pike was filming
customers in the ladies room.

576
00:51:31,077 --> 00:51:34,981
It can't be.
This just can't be.

577
00:51:35,014 --> 00:51:36,249
There are so many tapes.

578
00:51:36,282 --> 00:51:38,617
Shut up, Chaz.
It's not true.

579
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:41,620
Did you do this? Hm?
Or your little friend?

580
00:51:41,653 --> 00:51:43,990
No. I've never even
been in here before.

581
00:51:44,023 --> 00:51:45,558
What kind of a joke is this?

582
00:51:45,591 --> 00:51:46,793
Guys, look.

583
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:02,109
Give me that.

584
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:23,064
No way.

585
00:52:26,834 --> 00:52:28,303
This doesn't make any sense.

586
00:52:28,336 --> 00:52:30,938
This doesn't make
any kind of sense.

587
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:47,689
No... it all makes sense.

588
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,292
Mr. Pike's a liar.

589
00:52:50,326 --> 00:52:51,293
What?!

590
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,263
Mr. Pike is full of bull crap.

591
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,831
I mean, what's all that
crazy junk downstairs?

592
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:58,301
What are all these tapes?

593
00:52:58,335 --> 00:52:59,568
He's not a liar.

594
00:53:01,138 --> 00:53:02,205
Oh, yeah?

595
00:53:04,107 --> 00:53:06,008
Why'd you go to camp
this summer?

596
00:53:07,144 --> 00:53:08,944
What does that
have to do with anything?

597
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,280
Camp?

598
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:13,783
Aren't you a little old
for camp?

599
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:14,984
I'm just...

600
00:53:16,752 --> 00:53:18,954
I'm not supposed to
talk about it.

601
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:19,989
Why not?

602
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,561
Didn't you find it
transformative?

603
00:53:26,963 --> 00:53:28,066
How do you know about that?

604
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:29,866
Mr. Pike.

605
00:53:32,702 --> 00:53:34,037
He told you?

606
00:53:35,139 --> 00:53:36,807
He said it would fix things.

607
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:41,345
That it would take the burden
of homosexuality off you

608
00:53:41,379 --> 00:53:43,347
so you could be free
to live a normal life.

609
00:53:43,381 --> 00:53:45,350
You're gay?

610
00:53:45,384 --> 00:53:48,153
But... but...

611
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:50,822
you're, like, an athlete.

612
00:53:50,855 --> 00:53:52,291
She's lying.

613
00:53:52,324 --> 00:53:53,292
Shut up, Chaz.

614
00:53:53,325 --> 00:53:54,892
I'm lying?

615
00:53:54,926 --> 00:53:56,961
I'm lying?

616
00:53:56,994 --> 00:53:58,629
Who do you think told Mr. Pike

617
00:53:58,663 --> 00:54:02,367
that you were having
lustful thoughts about men?

618
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:03,968
Girls playing baseball...

619
00:54:04,001 --> 00:54:07,172
gay guys playing baseball...
what is going on, man?

620
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:10,343
It's not true.
It's not true.

621
00:54:10,376 --> 00:54:11,844
Chaz just can't stand it

622
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:14,414
that I am in love with Jasmine
and not her.

623
00:54:14,447 --> 00:54:16,982
There is no Jasmine.

624
00:54:52,986 --> 00:54:54,888
What in the Lord's name?

625
00:55:15,142 --> 00:55:16,311
Hello?

626
00:55:31,092 --> 00:55:32,827
Chaz?

627
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:34,129
Ricky?

628
00:55:35,931 --> 00:55:37,300
Where are you guys?

629
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:46,476
Chaz?

630
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,945
It's okay, man.

631
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,913
You can still beat this.

632
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,050
I was an addict too.

633
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,820
My vice? Nicotine.

634
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,359
It took me months.
Even after I found my edge.

635
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:06,762
But I haven't smoked in a year.

636
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:14,137
Mr. Pike helped me quit.
He helped me find God again.

637
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,407
He's no perv.

638
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:19,510
And neither are you.

639
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,145
<i>Hello?</i>

640
00:56:23,314 --> 00:56:25,916
C'mon, man.

641
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:28,118
There's no cryin' in baseball.

642
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,154
Guys...

643
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:33,024
<i>Alright now.</i>

644
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:34,426
<i>Enough's enough.</i>

645
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:44,470
He's here.

646
00:56:44,503 --> 00:56:46,505
- Mr. Pike!
- Mr. Pike!

647
00:56:46,538 --> 00:56:48,540
- Mr. Pike.
- We're in your office!

648
00:56:48,574 --> 00:56:50,008
He can't hear us.

649
00:56:56,114 --> 00:56:58,183
<i>I'm comin' in... guys?</i>

650
00:57:09,396 --> 00:57:10,563
Something's not right.

651
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,142
It's her.

652
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:24,878
Who?

653
00:57:42,596 --> 00:57:43,997
What is he doing?

654
00:58:03,951 --> 00:58:04,952
<i>Okay.</i>

655
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,025
<i>Oh, my.</i>

656
00:58:10,058 --> 00:58:11,059
Todd was right.

657
00:58:13,962 --> 00:58:15,631
<i>Is this really happening?</i>

658
00:58:47,631 --> 00:58:49,633
Whoa.

659
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:51,100
<i>Mercy.</i>

660
00:58:52,703 --> 00:58:54,070
<i>Mercy.</i>

661
00:58:55,472 --> 00:58:57,341
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

662
00:59:04,014 --> 00:59:06,183
What is that?

663
00:59:06,216 --> 00:59:09,353
Brother,
that's unbridled perversion.

664
00:59:09,386 --> 00:59:10,688
No, no, no.

665
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,391
That.

666
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,171
Oh, no.

667
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Mr. Pike! Oh, God!

668
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:55,167
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

669
01:00:00,474 --> 01:00:01,675
He's still alive.

670
01:00:03,042 --> 01:00:04,578
He's still alive.

671
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:07,547
We have to help him.

672
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:09,082
We have to help him.

673
01:00:09,115 --> 01:00:10,350
We have to help him.

674
01:00:10,383 --> 01:00:11,384
Come on!

675
01:00:21,094 --> 01:00:22,630
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

676
01:00:22,663 --> 01:00:23,531
What?!

677
01:00:23,564 --> 01:00:27,334
I'm the only one
who can handle this.

678
01:00:27,367 --> 01:00:29,770
Lock the door,
sit tight,

679
01:00:29,804 --> 01:00:32,741
don't move 'til I say,
"all clear."

680
01:00:32,774 --> 01:00:34,041
Read me?

681
01:00:34,075 --> 01:00:35,476
Are you sure?

682
01:00:38,112 --> 01:00:39,681
I have the bat.

683
01:00:40,682 --> 01:00:42,216
Go.

684
01:00:52,126 --> 01:00:53,562
Mr. Pike...

685
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:23,059
Put him down,
you godless beast.

686
01:02:21,286 --> 01:02:25,357
CBTL. CBTL. CBTL. CBTL...

687
01:02:50,416 --> 01:02:52,418
Nicotine.

688
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:30,658
Christ...

689
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:33,594
Bears...

690
01:03:35,596 --> 01:03:36,664
The...

691
01:03:37,966 --> 01:03:39,567
Loaaa...

692
01:03:43,571 --> 01:03:45,775
Ah! My nut!

693
01:03:47,342 --> 01:03:48,712
She got Jeff!

694
01:04:08,498 --> 01:04:11,267
Whoa.

695
01:04:11,301 --> 01:04:15,906
She... exploded...
my... nuts.

696
01:04:18,843 --> 01:04:21,277
It's just like in there...

697
01:04:27,818 --> 01:04:29,319
Hey. Hey, hey. No.

698
01:04:29,352 --> 01:04:30,788
Stay with me.

699
01:04:30,821 --> 01:04:32,758
Hey! Hey!
Stick with me here, Jeff.

700
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:34,692
Okay... alright...

701
01:04:40,698 --> 01:04:42,868
- No.
- Let me help you.

702
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:44,836
I did first aid
for the baseball team.

703
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:46,737
But Ricky...

704
01:04:46,772 --> 01:04:50,776
Look, Jeff...
you're bleeding out.

705
01:04:50,809 --> 01:04:53,744
Are you sure
it's a good idea?

706
01:04:53,779 --> 01:04:55,479
I mean... you know...

707
01:04:56,581 --> 01:04:58,383
Because you're a gay dude.

708
01:04:59,618 --> 01:05:01,020
Do you think
I'm going to get turned on

709
01:05:01,053 --> 01:05:03,355
by your exploded testicles?

710
01:05:03,388 --> 01:05:05,690
Is that how you think
being gay works?

711
01:05:06,691 --> 01:05:08,895
Honestly, man...

712
01:05:08,928 --> 01:05:10,830
I have no idea.

713
01:05:32,019 --> 01:05:33,619
Ow.

714
01:05:36,924 --> 01:05:38,391
Oh.

715
01:05:39,827 --> 01:05:41,061
Uhh.

716
01:05:48,002 --> 01:05:49,871
Oh.

717
01:05:52,006 --> 01:05:53,807
We have to find Todd...

718
01:05:53,842 --> 01:05:55,043
Before that thing does.

719
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,145
I know
he's your friend, man.

720
01:05:57,178 --> 01:05:59,047
But there's no saving him now.

721
01:06:00,048 --> 01:06:01,682
You saw what happened
to Mr. Pike.

722
01:06:01,715 --> 01:06:02,783
Mr. Pike...
It's a pervert's fate.

723
01:06:02,816 --> 01:06:04,418
No, he's not a pervert.

724
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:14,762
It wasn't his idea to peep
on that lady in her bathroom.

725
01:06:15,965 --> 01:06:16,966
It was mine.

726
01:06:18,067 --> 01:06:19,134
Todd didn't want to,

727
01:06:19,168 --> 01:06:22,437
but he did it
because I asked him.

728
01:06:23,471 --> 01:06:25,406
He climbed that tree with me,
and then...

729
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:28,978
The lady caught us,
and Todd...

730
01:06:29,011 --> 01:06:32,414
just... couldn't get
down the tree fast enough.

731
01:06:32,448 --> 01:06:33,849
You know, 'cause...

732
01:06:33,884 --> 01:06:35,986
his hand.

733
01:06:36,019 --> 01:06:37,087
- And I ran away.
- Abe...

734
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,421
...He didn't even
want to be there and I ran.

735
01:06:39,455 --> 01:06:41,657
I left him and he got caught
and never said a word.

736
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:43,159
Why are you saying all this?

737
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,695
He's not the pervert, Chaz.

738
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:49,565
I am.

739
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:53,569
Okay.

740
01:06:57,008 --> 01:06:58,042
Okay.

741
01:07:00,211 --> 01:07:01,778
Alright...

742
01:07:01,811 --> 01:07:03,047
It's all done.

743
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:08,152
Here.

744
01:07:10,587 --> 01:07:11,888
Take these.

745
01:07:11,923 --> 01:07:13,657
Look.

746
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,524
They're pain killers.

747
01:07:14,557 --> 01:07:16,660
I use them when
my shoulder flares up.

748
01:07:16,693 --> 01:07:18,930
My life is poison-free, Ricky.

749
01:07:18,963 --> 01:07:20,765
You know that's non-negotiable.

750
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:24,069
You consume
at least a 144 ounces

751
01:07:24,102 --> 01:07:27,471
of caffeine-free diet coke,
every day.

752
01:07:27,505 --> 01:07:29,607
Pain is temporary...

753
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,043
honor is immortal.

754
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:34,512
What are we up against here?

755
01:07:34,545 --> 01:07:36,214
It's called a succubus.

756
01:07:36,248 --> 01:07:39,251
Sh-She's a handmaiden
of the Evil One...

757
01:07:39,284 --> 01:07:42,720
whose profane thirst
in unquenchable.

758
01:07:42,753 --> 01:07:46,725
She inflames the loins...
and ravages the soul.

759
01:07:46,758 --> 01:07:47,994
Once under her spell,

760
01:07:48,027 --> 01:07:52,966
her supplicants become prisoners
of their own wicked desires...

761
01:07:52,999 --> 01:07:54,599
for all eternity.

762
01:07:56,002 --> 01:07:57,003
Let me see.

763
01:07:59,938 --> 01:08:02,641
Yeah... that's the one
that popped me.

764
01:08:02,674 --> 01:08:04,277
No one is safe.

765
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:06,112
I saw her in the basement...

766
01:08:06,145 --> 01:08:07,546
she kissed me.

767
01:08:09,149 --> 01:08:10,516
Was it sexy?

768
01:08:11,551 --> 01:08:13,020
She was a man.

769
01:08:13,053 --> 01:08:14,787
Oh, Jesus.

770
01:08:14,821 --> 01:08:15,855
Guys.

771
01:08:16,856 --> 01:08:18,491
When we watched that movie...

772
01:08:20,227 --> 01:08:22,196
we unleashed a sex demon.

773
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:25,765
See, kids?

774
01:08:26,766 --> 01:08:29,869
That's why I don't watch porno.

775
01:08:29,902 --> 01:08:31,138
Abe, we have to
destroy the film.

776
01:08:31,171 --> 01:08:32,307
That's how this
whole thing started,

777
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:33,174
that's how we'll finish it.

778
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:34,575
Come on, it's
still in the projector.

779
01:08:34,608 --> 01:08:36,277
No. I have to find Todd.

780
01:08:37,778 --> 01:08:39,713
We've seen what she can do.

781
01:08:39,747 --> 01:08:41,016
I can't abandon him.

782
01:08:43,084 --> 01:08:44,085
Not again.

783
01:08:45,686 --> 01:08:47,088
Abe, you're brave.

784
01:08:48,289 --> 01:08:49,556
But remember...

785
01:08:50,591 --> 01:08:52,826
Don't let it tempt you.

786
01:08:53,961 --> 01:08:55,696
I couldn't hold my edge.

787
01:08:56,698 --> 01:08:58,200
That's how I lost my nuts.

788
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:02,771
That's how Mr. Pike
lost the whole package.

789
01:09:24,061 --> 01:09:25,062
Todd.

790
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:31,934
Todd!

791
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:16,681
You guys ready?

792
01:10:32,764 --> 01:10:33,832
Let it burn.

793
01:10:39,738 --> 01:10:42,242
Guys, why is there no smoke?

794
01:10:46,879 --> 01:10:49,014
So he looked and behold...

795
01:10:50,015 --> 01:10:51,984
The brush was burning with fire.

796
01:10:52,985 --> 01:10:54,720
But it was not consumed.

797
01:10:55,922 --> 01:10:56,990
Figures...

798
01:10:59,058 --> 01:11:02,095
We need to pray. That's-that's
the only way that we beat this.

799
01:11:03,129 --> 01:11:04,265
Count me out.

800
01:11:12,373 --> 01:11:13,374
Give me a light.

801
01:11:14,807 --> 01:11:16,075
Jeff, are you sure?

802
01:11:18,778 --> 01:11:20,282
I believe in nothing now.

803
01:11:43,137 --> 01:11:45,341
Lord, forgive us
for the abomination

804
01:11:45,374 --> 01:11:47,809
that we have brought
into our lives.

805
01:11:47,842 --> 01:11:50,745
Please cleanse our souls
and let us be released from

806
01:11:50,779 --> 01:11:52,981
what our iniquity has wrought.

807
01:11:53,014 --> 01:11:55,083
Let this foul,
malevolent force be cast

808
01:11:55,116 --> 01:11:57,286
back into the darkness
from where it came.

809
01:12:15,204 --> 01:12:17,073
I'm so sorry, Ricky.

810
01:12:18,342 --> 01:12:21,077
I always wondered
how Mr. Pike knew.

811
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:22,878
I mean, I thought
I was hiding it well.

812
01:12:22,912 --> 01:12:25,147
A-A lot of guys wear
earrings these days.

813
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:29,353
I didn't know you were
going to give up baseball.

814
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:31,321
He told my parents, Chaz.

815
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:35,560
I-I was trying to help you.

816
01:12:35,593 --> 01:12:37,528
Did you pray
for me to be fixed?

817
01:12:42,433 --> 01:12:43,767
Guys, stop it.

818
01:12:45,436 --> 01:12:47,137
Mr. Pike is a fraud.

819
01:12:48,339 --> 01:12:50,173
This place is a den of filth.

820
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:52,943
God has abandoned us.

821
01:12:54,077 --> 01:12:56,014
All we have is each other.

822
01:12:59,318 --> 01:13:00,985
We have to find Todd.

823
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:04,981
Oh.

824
01:15:11,755 --> 01:15:13,022
Did you see that?

825
01:15:14,525 --> 01:15:16,727
Did you... did you see that?

826
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,362
Abe, your pants.

827
01:15:29,139 --> 01:15:31,074
It's-It's Todd...

828
01:15:32,075 --> 01:15:33,210
He's in there.

829
01:16:17,657 --> 01:16:20,392
Todd? Todd!

830
01:16:20,426 --> 01:16:21,327
Holy crap! Is he dead?

831
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,262
No, wait. Look.
He's still moving.

832
01:16:48,121 --> 01:16:49,790
It's the creepy old man.

833
01:16:49,824 --> 01:16:51,057
Jeff was right.

834
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:54,629
He was behind this whole thing.

835
01:17:00,636 --> 01:17:01,670
Oh, man...

836
01:17:01,703 --> 01:17:02,704
He's bleeding.

837
01:17:03,639 --> 01:17:06,474
I see you've been
touched by the demon...

838
01:17:06,507 --> 01:17:08,309
same as me.

839
01:17:08,342 --> 01:17:11,345
Oh, I have been touched
by her...

840
01:17:11,379 --> 01:17:15,082
but not the same as you!

841
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,073
Don't you touch him!

842
01:17:39,408 --> 01:17:42,210
Todd! Are you okay?
What have they done to you?

843
01:17:42,244 --> 01:17:43,581
I got knocked out.

844
01:17:43,614 --> 01:17:45,849
This guy cut his penis off.

845
01:17:45,883 --> 01:17:47,885
I don't know why.

846
01:17:47,918 --> 01:17:49,419
Nobody tells Todd anything.

847
01:17:49,452 --> 01:17:50,721
You've seen
his pictures, Todd.

848
01:17:50,754 --> 01:17:52,422
You saw his posters.

849
01:17:52,455 --> 01:17:54,324
He's a smut peddler.

850
01:17:54,357 --> 01:17:56,594
He unleashed the monster
that killed Mr. Pike,

851
01:17:56,627 --> 01:17:57,695
and now he wants to turn you

852
01:17:57,728 --> 01:17:59,763
into his own
personal pleasure pony!

853
01:17:59,797 --> 01:18:01,599
- What?!
- What do you want?

854
01:18:01,632 --> 01:18:02,600
Me?

855
01:18:03,667 --> 01:18:05,669
I want the same as you.

856
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:09,708
Out of this place!

857
01:18:09,741 --> 01:18:11,241
You see...

858
01:18:11,275 --> 01:18:16,213
This was mine... yeah?
All mine.

859
01:18:16,246 --> 01:18:18,415
Before they drove me out...

860
01:18:18,449 --> 01:18:21,920
Before they burned
my archive... my face...

861
01:18:21,953 --> 01:18:25,255
This was my pleasure palace!

862
01:18:25,289 --> 01:18:29,794
And I the Lord
...Lord Beekman!

863
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:36,601
Oh, but we must be quick now...

864
01:18:36,636 --> 01:18:39,571
The hour of unity approaches.

865
01:18:39,604 --> 01:18:42,708
You were kind enough
to conjure her.

866
01:18:42,742 --> 01:18:46,511
Now I have arranged
the sacred instruments.

867
01:18:46,544 --> 01:18:50,850
The mortar...
the bells... the knife.

868
01:18:50,883 --> 01:18:53,318
I provided the ounce of flesh.

869
01:18:53,351 --> 01:18:56,657
And this...
this degenerate...

870
01:18:56,690 --> 01:19:00,259
holds the final ingredient...

871
01:19:00,292 --> 01:19:02,595
Virgin blood.

872
01:19:10,536 --> 01:19:12,605
Stop cutting me! Please!

873
01:19:12,638 --> 01:19:14,975
Not one step further.

874
01:19:15,008 --> 01:19:16,375
Or I'll let him...

875
01:19:17,443 --> 01:19:18,679
Like a goat.

876
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:25,853
Blood of virgins.

877
01:19:25,887 --> 01:19:30,357
Purity... and light.

878
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,715
Stand back, children...

879
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:28,818
and behold!

880
01:20:28,852 --> 01:20:32,522
They will never
separate me again

881
01:20:32,555 --> 01:20:35,325
from the Goddess of the Flesh!

882
01:21:57,810 --> 01:21:58,811
No!

883
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:03,482
Don't!

884
01:22:20,434 --> 01:22:21,435
Whoa.

885
01:22:44,994 --> 01:22:45,995
Hello?

886
01:22:54,003 --> 01:22:55,972
Where are we?

887
01:22:58,607 --> 01:22:59,976
I think we're
in the same place.

888
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:01,211
Todd!

889
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:03,545
You're okay!

890
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:05,048
Are you okay?

891
01:23:05,081 --> 01:23:06,849
Why am I
in my street clothes?

892
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:09,185
Where are Chaz and Ricky?

893
01:23:10,753 --> 01:23:11,988
Chaz?

894
01:23:13,023 --> 01:23:14,124
Ricky?

895
01:23:15,258 --> 01:23:17,027
Maybe they're upstairs?

896
01:23:25,136 --> 01:23:26,670
Chaz?

897
01:23:28,638 --> 01:23:29,706
Ricky?

898
01:23:34,045 --> 01:23:35,947
Is it morning already?

899
01:23:37,248 --> 01:23:38,682
No way.

900
01:23:41,118 --> 01:23:42,585
Ow.

901
01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:43,621
What?

902
01:23:44,722 --> 01:23:45,958
It burned me.

903
01:23:48,759 --> 01:23:49,827
Ah.

904
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:53,864
Help...

905
01:23:53,898 --> 01:23:55,733
- Help!
- Hey, help!

906
01:23:55,766 --> 01:23:59,804
Help! Help us!

907
01:23:59,837 --> 01:24:02,940
Help us! Help!

908
01:24:04,309 --> 01:24:05,676
Help.

909
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:20,093
Whoa!

910
01:24:20,126 --> 01:24:21,626
Did you see that?

911
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:24,963
This... is no bueno.

912
01:24:24,998 --> 01:24:27,566
Uh, guys?

913
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,869
Todd... your hand.

914
01:24:30,902 --> 01:24:32,106
Weird.

915
01:24:33,273 --> 01:24:35,209
Fuck yes.

916
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,021
Todd?

917
01:24:48,288 --> 01:24:49,989
Todd?

918
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,062
Oh, boy.

919
01:25:11,845 --> 01:25:13,580
Oh,.

920
01:25:25,627 --> 01:25:27,896
Please...

921
01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:30,765
What should I do?

922
01:25:40,909 --> 01:25:41,943
Sorry.

923
01:25:44,713 --> 01:25:45,714
True form...

924
01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:47,917
What?

925
01:25:50,686 --> 01:25:52,021
What was that?

926
01:25:52,054 --> 01:25:52,922
It's a book...

927
01:25:52,955 --> 01:25:54,757
We unleashed a sex demon...

928
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:55,691
It's called a succubus...

929
01:25:55,724 --> 01:25:56,560
What does that
look like to you?

930
01:25:56,592 --> 01:25:57,626
I don't care about that book.

931
01:25:57,660 --> 01:26:00,729
The mortar...
the bells... the knife...

932
01:26:00,763 --> 01:26:04,700
I have arranged
the sacred instruments...

933
01:26:04,733 --> 01:26:06,001
She kissed me...

934
01:26:06,035 --> 01:26:08,638
True form... true form...
true form...

935
01:26:08,672 --> 01:26:10,108
The sacred instruments.

936
01:26:11,109 --> 01:26:12,776
The demon can only be
summoned or dispatched

937
01:26:12,809 --> 01:26:14,711
via the sacred instruments...

938
01:26:14,744 --> 01:26:16,746
when it's in its...
true form.

939
01:26:18,949 --> 01:26:20,118
What'd you just say?

940
01:26:30,461 --> 01:26:32,029
Chaz, what's going on?

941
01:26:32,063 --> 01:26:33,064
I have a plan.

942
01:26:33,097 --> 01:26:34,299
For what?

943
01:26:34,333 --> 01:26:36,235
For getting
our friends back.

944
01:26:39,737 --> 01:26:41,973
Man, what is
going on right now?

945
01:26:43,475 --> 01:26:45,377
Real wrath of god-type stuff.

946
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:47,044
Fire and brimstone
coming down from the skies.

947
01:26:47,078 --> 01:26:49,680
Rivers and seas boiling.
Forty years of darkness.

948
01:26:49,714 --> 01:26:50,616
Earthquakes, volcanoes,
the dead

949
01:26:50,648 --> 01:26:52,049
- rising from the grave...
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

950
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:53,152
Is this from
The Book of Revelations?

951
01:26:54,018 --> 01:26:55,188
Ghostbusters.

952
01:27:05,265 --> 01:27:06,865
I think we have company.

953
01:29:02,953 --> 01:29:04,087
It's working.

954
01:29:29,147 --> 01:29:30,114
What is that?

955
01:29:30,148 --> 01:29:31,282
I don't know.

956
01:29:31,317 --> 01:29:33,151
What are we gonna do?

957
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,420
Die.

958
01:29:35,887 --> 01:29:37,389
Todd?

959
01:29:37,423 --> 01:29:38,923
What's up, pussy?

960
01:29:40,124 --> 01:29:43,162
You must be stoked to be
in the girls' bathroom.

961
01:29:43,195 --> 01:29:46,433
You come in here to
lick the toilet seats or what?

962
01:29:46,466 --> 01:29:48,100
No. It's not-It's not him.

963
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:49,602
He's, like, possessed
or something.

964
01:29:49,636 --> 01:29:54,873
Nah, dawg. I'm not possessed.
I'm fucking free.

965
01:29:54,907 --> 01:29:58,077
And now, you're going to die
dickless in the girl's shitter.

966
01:29:58,110 --> 01:29:59,912
Just like that fuckwad Mr. Pike.

967
01:29:59,945 --> 01:30:01,381
Hey, watch your mouth,
Demon Todd.

968
01:30:01,414 --> 01:30:03,450
Hey, fuck you, poser!

969
01:30:04,584 --> 01:30:06,085
What did you call me?

970
01:30:06,118 --> 01:30:08,888
A poser. A crybaby.

971
01:30:08,922 --> 01:30:12,959
A momma's boy who got
too scared at college

972
01:30:12,992 --> 01:30:16,129
and came running home
with his tail between his legs.

973
01:30:16,162 --> 01:30:17,097
You know what I would've done

974
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:19,667
for a crack at all that
free porn and booze

975
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:22,035
you ran away from
at that college?

976
01:30:23,036 --> 01:30:26,540
I would have given
my right fucking hand.

977
01:30:29,943 --> 01:30:31,580
But now I don't have to.

978
01:30:31,613 --> 01:30:34,449
Once I'm done with you two,
I'm gonna saddle up

979
01:30:34,483 --> 01:30:37,284
and strap in for an eternity
full of fucking...

980
01:30:37,318 --> 01:30:40,054
fightin',
and gettin' my knob slobbed

981
01:30:40,087 --> 01:30:42,624
by that sexy-ass demon chick.

982
01:30:43,625 --> 01:30:45,092
We have to kill Todd.

983
01:30:49,431 --> 01:30:51,600
Come at me, bitch.

984
01:30:51,633 --> 01:30:52,634
Ricky?

985
01:30:55,471 --> 01:30:56,672
Are you ready?

986
01:31:00,610 --> 01:31:01,977
Ricky?

987
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:03,378
Should I do it?

988
01:31:06,449 --> 01:31:09,552
Ricky! What are you seeing?

989
01:31:09,585 --> 01:31:10,586
What's it like?

990
01:31:11,587 --> 01:31:12,588
Just...

991
01:31:13,756 --> 01:31:17,392
Give me...
a few more minutes...

992
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:26,035
No, wait!
You can't hurt him.

993
01:31:26,068 --> 01:31:28,739
Regular Todd is still
inside him. I know it.

994
01:31:28,772 --> 01:31:30,106
Look, Todd...

995
01:31:32,008 --> 01:31:33,109
I know you're in there.

996
01:31:33,142 --> 01:31:34,678
Regular Todd is dead.

997
01:31:34,711 --> 01:31:36,513
There's only Demon Todd now.

998
01:31:36,547 --> 01:31:38,281
- Move over, Abe.
- No, no, no, no, wait!

999
01:31:39,716 --> 01:31:42,218
Abe! We're in trouble, man!

1000
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:46,023
Regular Todd,
if you can hear me,

1001
01:31:46,056 --> 01:31:48,258
I need you to know one thing.

1002
01:31:48,292 --> 01:31:50,260
I love you, man.

1003
01:31:50,294 --> 01:31:51,261
You always get my back.

1004
01:31:51,295 --> 01:31:53,565
And you never complain
when I don't get yours.

1005
01:31:53,598 --> 01:31:56,333
You're the best friend
a guy could have.

1006
01:31:56,366 --> 01:31:58,402
I realize that now.

1007
01:31:58,435 --> 01:31:59,704
And if I die here today,

1008
01:31:59,737 --> 01:32:01,506
I'll be glad I got to spend

1009
01:32:01,539 --> 01:32:04,274
my last few moments alive
with you.

1010
01:32:04,308 --> 01:32:06,376
There's nobody else
I'd rather spend them with.

1011
01:32:10,248 --> 01:32:11,216
Come here, man.

1012
01:32:11,249 --> 01:32:12,283
Don't do it, dude!

1013
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,590
Oldest trick
in the fucking book!

1014
01:32:19,592 --> 01:32:21,426
My nuts!

1015
01:32:24,563 --> 01:32:25,564
Ricky!

1016
01:32:26,599 --> 01:32:28,801
Ricky, I'm going to do it now.

1017
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:31,303
I have to change it back
to its true form,

1018
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:32,304
or you can't kill it.

1019
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:33,540
No, wait.

1020
01:32:33,573 --> 01:32:35,107
No, I have to.

1021
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:37,644
If you go all the way,
the demon will kill you.

1022
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:39,311
Hold on a second...

1023
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:43,415
Ricky! Ricky, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it!

1024
01:32:45,417 --> 01:32:49,756
No! No! No!

1025
01:33:08,308 --> 01:33:10,645
- Please!
- Oh, boo hoo.

1026
01:33:10,678 --> 01:33:12,680
Abe's trapped in Hellworld.

1027
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:14,114
I'm going to rip off
your ding-dong

1028
01:33:14,147 --> 01:33:16,349
and feed it to you
like a baby bird.

1029
01:33:18,151 --> 01:33:19,320
Really?

1030
01:33:19,353 --> 01:33:22,123
Let's get those pants off,
big boy.

1031
01:33:42,276 --> 01:33:44,079
Ricky!

1032
01:34:01,163 --> 01:34:02,164
Bingo.

1033
01:34:25,455 --> 01:34:27,523
Aw, shoot.

1034
01:34:37,969 --> 01:34:39,236
Whoa.

1035
01:34:52,651 --> 01:34:54,920
I'm sorry I grabbed
your junk, dude.

1036
01:34:54,954 --> 01:34:56,287
I feel awful.

1037
01:34:56,321 --> 01:34:58,958
It's okay, buddy.
It wasn't you.

1038
01:34:58,991 --> 01:35:00,826
Thank you
for coming after me.

1039
01:35:02,327 --> 01:35:03,663
Yes!

1040
01:35:05,296 --> 01:35:07,298
Guys! Oh, you're back!

1041
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:09,534
See. Your plan worked.

1042
01:35:09,567 --> 01:35:10,703
Ricky,
what happened to you?

1043
01:35:10,736 --> 01:35:13,371
Oh... I...

1044
01:35:13,405 --> 01:35:14,572
We killed her...

1045
01:35:14,606 --> 01:35:17,743
or trapped her
back in the film, at least.

1046
01:35:26,252 --> 01:35:27,319
Someone has to watch over it.

1047
01:35:28,487 --> 01:35:30,322
Make sure nobody
ever sees it again.

1048
01:35:31,825 --> 01:35:36,863
Abe... what if you get,
like, tempted or something?

1049
01:35:39,398 --> 01:35:40,834
CBTL.

1050
01:35:45,405 --> 01:35:48,341
So... what do we do now?

1051
01:36:00,487 --> 01:36:02,355
Let's get the heck
out of here.

1052
01:36:47,993 --> 01:36:52,993
