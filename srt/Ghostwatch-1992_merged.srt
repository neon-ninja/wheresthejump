00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,070
The programme
you're about to watch

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,830
is a unique live investigation
of the supernatural.

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,100
It contains material which

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,600
some viewers
may find to be disturbing.

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,000
No creaking gates,

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,100
no Gothic towers,
no shutter windows,

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,970
yet, for the past 10 months,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
this house has been the focus
of an astonishing barrage

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,400
of supernatural activity.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,730
This footage was shot
by parapsychologists
investigating the case.

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,030
Now, you're about to see
one of the incidents

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,200
that have earned
this house its reputation.

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,630
-Let's see what you think.
-I can't sleep.
Turn the light off.

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,370
Mum said if you don't...

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,070
All right. All right.

16
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,270
(BANGING)

17
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,300
Mum.

18
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,330
Mum. Mum! Mummy,

19
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,030
it's back! It's back!

20
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,730
-Mum!
-Mum.

21
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,230
Mum. Mum.

22
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,900
-Help me.
-(SCREAMING)

23
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,030
-Help me.
-Don't touch me!

24
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,400
-(HIT ON THE DOOR)
-Don't touch me.

25
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,770
(SCREAMING)

26
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,230
-Don't..
-(BOTH SCREAM)

27
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,830
-Quickly!
-Mum! Mum!

28
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,330
-Mum.
-Mum.

31
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,230
MICHAEL: So welcome live
this Halloween night

32
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,130
to the first ever
TV  Ghostwatch.

33
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,370
That's the scene in
Foxhill Drive in Northolt.

34
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,630
They are outside
broadcasting this

35
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,900
and there, that's the house

36
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,770
where it might
all happen tonight

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,830
or it might not. We shall see.

38
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,630
We're going to investigate
one of the most baffling

39
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,730
and fascinating areas
of human experience,

40
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,070
the supernatural.

41
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,630
Tonight, television is going
ghost-hunting

42
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,730
in an unprecedented
scientific experiment,
where we hope to show you

43
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,000
for the first time
irrefutable proof that

44
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,630
ghosts really do exist.

45
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,700
I'm joined in the studio
by Dr Lin Pascoe

46
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,170
to give her expert
technical advice.

47
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,100
Throughout the programme, I'll
be taking other expert opinion

48
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,330
about the supernatural
from both here and America.

49
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,100
You'll be telling us
your ghost stories.

50
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,230
And as our tale unfolds,
we'll be taking your calls

51
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,670
about just what you're seeing.

52
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,730
Well, let's go to the main
location of our programme,

53
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,330
the house in Foxhill Drive.

54
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,630
Craig Charles,
a well-known ghost hunter,

55
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,670
is our reporter.

56
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,070
Craig, how are you?

57
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,000
Hi, Michael.

58
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,070
Yeah, I'm fine.

59
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,900
I've taken the Valium, man.

60
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,330
Later on,
we're gonna be interviewing

61
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,000
the medium who tried
unsuccessfully

62
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,230
to exorcise
the house behind me.

63
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,200
I wonder if he's heard
from Elvis lately.

64
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,930
All right, there.
With me is Pam Early,
the mum of the house.

65
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,000
-Hello, Pam.
-Hello.

66
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,000
And she's gonna be taking us
through the whole
spine-tingling story.

(HUMMING THE TWILIGHT ZONE

68
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,370
And after that, you can share
with us your own
supernatural experience

69
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,130
on our very own Halloween
witch-board.

70
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,670
I mean, switchboard.

71
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,370
-Over to you Smithy.
-MIKE: Thanks, Craig.

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,800
We'll come back to you
later on.

73
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,200
All right,
this part of the studio

74
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,900
is your part of the studio

75
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,200
this evening, because this is
the phone number

76
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,800
we'd like you to call us on.

77
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,070
You can now see
our Ghostwatch  team are here

78
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,270
ready to take your calls.

79
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,870
We particularly
want to hear from you

80
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,830
if you've had
any personal experiences

81
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,370
of ghosts or the supernatural.
Call us now.

82
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,930
As a matter of fact,
of course, Mike Smith

83
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,370
has a very particular reason

84
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,300
for keeping a beady eye
on the proceedings tonight.

85
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,870
-Michael.
-Well, so would you,
if your wife had just told you

86
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,970
she was gonna spend
the best part of her night

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,900
in the most haunted house
in Britain.

88
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,970
Of course we're taking about
Sarah Greene.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,200
And Sarah is our reporter
who'll be spending the night,

90
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,030
actually,
inside our haunted house.

91
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,830
She was very keen to do it,
I understand, Mike.

92
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,270
Oh, yeah,
jumped at the chance.

93
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,200
Actually, so did I, because

94
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,330
we've both been interested
in ghosts and that weird
sort of stuff.

95
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,100
And to be honest,
I could never have

96
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,000
sat at home tonight on my own
and watched this programme.

97
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,300
I'm safer here.

98
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,930
MICHAEL: All right, Mike,
thanks a lot.

99
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,030
Now, confrontations, of
course, with the supernatural,

100
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,730
can be devastatingly real.

101
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,630
Let's find out
what effect they've had

102
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,870
on Mrs Early and her family.

103
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,630
So, how destructive has
the haunting actually been?

104
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,030
Mum kept on blaming us
for breaking stuff.

105
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,170
We weren't doing anything.

106
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,270
I've lost track,
really, I have.

107
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,070
Plates, teapots, cups,
a broken tap,

108
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,870
we got this thick smell,
so disgusting, from the tap.

109
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,130
And stains got on clothes from
nowhere, out of thin air.

110
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,400
-And in the central
heating vent.
-The man came, and...

111
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,870
He couldn't understand it,
he said it was impossible.

112
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,630
Everybody said
it was impossible.

113
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,900
I said, "Great. You come
and live with 'impossible'."

114
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,170
So many things
have happened...

115
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,670
You start thinking...

116
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,900
I don't know...

117
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,370
Maybe you've done
something wrong.

118
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,300
It's wrecked my... My house,

119
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,230
my home, my family...

120
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,630
CRAIG: It's okay.

121
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,070
Over to you, Michael.

122
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,630
Dr Lin Pascoe,
it's a disturbing interview,
that, isn't it?

123
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,930
You investigated
the Northolt poltergeist
for eight months, wasn't it?

124
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,330
What can be done
for people like Mrs Early?

125
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,700
According to
the evidence on that film,
clearly she's shattered.

126
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,970
Well, the first thing
we can all do for a start is

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,270
believe them.

128
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, it's not always
that easy, is it?

129
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,400
Yes, but you can see,

130
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,100
it's obvious these people
are desperate for help.

131
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,900
Makes me so angry when
you still get people out there

132
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,930
denying that these things
even happen.

133
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,230
All right, Dr Pascoe,
for the moment, thank you
very much indeed.

134
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,770
Lin Pascoe will be giving
her expert commentary

135
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,170
right throughout
the programme.

136
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,870
And by the way, for those
night owls amongst you,

137
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,630
we'll be here with updates
roughly every hour,

138
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,400
right through the night.

139
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,700
Well,
now it's high time we met
our intrepid ghost-watcher,

140
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,630
Sarah Greene.

141
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,870
First hospital watch, Sarah,
now a ghost watch,
big difference.

142
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,400
Well, I suppose the truth is
I love a mystery,

143
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,270
and who knows, we may get to
the bottom of this one.

144
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,130
Actually, my own experience
with things ghostly,

145
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,900
albeit very brief,
was so intriguing,

146
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,030
I thought I might
get the chance to learn
a bit more tonight.

147
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,270
Well, perhaps,
we might get a chance

148
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,900
to hear more of your story
later on.

149
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,700
Yeah, if we get
an opportunity, I'd love to.

150
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,970
Actually, Smithy was there
when I had my encounter

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,270
with what I think was a ghost.

152
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,100
-But he wasn't quite as struck
as me, there, were you...
-Well, no. Well, yes.

153
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,630
I mean, I think,
this is the right environment
so study these things.

154
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,370
Yeah, that's why I get
sent out here to the frontline

155
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,630
and you stay all cosy
and safe and sound
in the studio, isn't it?

156
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,130
Well, good luck,
and I'll see you later.

157
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,270
Now, before we go into
the lion's den,

158
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,670
I'd like to introduce you
to Alan Demescu.

159
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,630
He is an electronics engineer,

160
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,270
and a member of the Society
for Psychical Research.

161
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,070
Now, Alan,
we have a whole array

162
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,000
of technology here with us.

163
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,130
What are you hoping
to discover tonight?

164
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,800
Well, the paranormal covers
a wide range of aspects,

165
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,270
but tonight,
we're concentrating on

166
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,700
what we call,
"Spontaneous cases."

167
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,070
What are they exactly?

168
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,770
Well, anything from
inexplicable noises,

169
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,700
footsteps, knocking,

170
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,230
irrefutive voices, presences,
the feeling of being watched,

171
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,730
er, electrical interference,

172
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,870
say, you know, your TV,
lights, telephone...

173
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,800
Right along at the far end
of the spectrum

174
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,730
to actual, full-blown
visual apparitions.

175
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,130
Now, we've got
our own BBC scanner here

176
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,100
but what are you
using it for exactly?

177
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,630
Well, we've got
a remote video camera

178
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,030
mounted in every room.

179
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,900
Erm...

180
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,200
We have our image analysis
equipment linked in,

181
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,630
the tape is timecoded.

182
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,830
And atmospheric condition
and temperature

183
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,000
are logged onscreen
by sensors.

184
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,900
Those are like
the little burglar alarms

185
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,030
-with the red lights.
-Right.

186
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,370
Except,
they're triggered by cold

187
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,970
instead of heat.

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,900
Erm, intense cold spots
are a secondary phenomenon.

189
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,070
We also want to detect
low and high frequencies.

190
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,200
Basically,
any aberration at all

191
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,030
could be a signal or a clue.

192
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,030
Well, we hope you get lots
of both of those.

193
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,300
-We'll leave you to it, Alan.
-Okay.

194
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,930
And, we'll go back outside

195
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,900
where I'm going to be able to
introduce you to

196
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,870
two of the very
important people

197
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,100
who are at the frontline
of this vigil,

198
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,170
as psychical researchers
call it.

199
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Now, the first person
is actually standing
right behind the camera,

200
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,130
and if he hands over to me,
you'll notice two things.

201
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,630
First of all,

202
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,730
that his hand
is a lot steadier than mine,

203
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,970
and secondly, that he bears

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,030
a remarkable resemblance
to Mike Gatting.

205
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,170
Yes, you do. (LAUGHS)

206
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,800
-Chris Miller.
-Hi.

207
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,870
SARAH: Now, Chris, does this
camera differ in any way

208
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,730
from the sort of camera
you'd normally use
on an outside broadcast?

209
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,670
Well, it's a normal
lightweight mobile camera,

210
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,000
but in this case,
it's been adapted

211
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,000
so we can use infrared
as well.

212
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,130
-SARAH: Can we see
how that works, Chris...
-Yeah, sure.

213
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,100
...if I hand this
back to you?

214
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,870
SARAH: What's the best way
to demonstrate it?

215
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,730
CHRIS: Well, if we can
kill the lights...

216
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,700
SARAH: Okay, Clive, can we
pop the lights down now?

217
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,600
CHRIS: There you go.
SARAH: Wow. How's that?

218
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,870
-CHRIS: I can see you
quite clearly now.
-Oh, look.

219
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,630
Yeah, so can I, on a monitor.

220
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,030
I'm quite close to you though.

221
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,830
I mean, what about
the people down here?

222
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,100
If we move down here...
How fast can you move

223
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,230
with that thing
on your shoulder, actually?

224
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,830
-Quite fast.
-It's not bad.

225
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,700
Who needs a Steadicam
when you got Chris Miller?

226
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,730
That's what I say.

227
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,700
Oh, yes, there they are.

228
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,770
CHRIS: There they all are.

229
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,670
(SARAH LAUGHING)

230
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,600
CHRIS: Somebody wants to
get in the frame.

231
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,900
SARAH: Funny, they can see
what they look like.

232
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,300
I'll tell you what though,
this means for us, doesn't it,

233
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,230
that nothing can lurk
in the shadows.

234
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,400
CHRIS: That's right,
there's no hiding place.

235
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,070
Absolutely.

236
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,700
Erm, right, let's have
the lights back up again then.

237
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,830
Okay, now,
we've got our vision back.

238
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,970
I think it's time to
meet sound.

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,300
Man of sound mind here,
Mike Aiton.

240
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,870
Not only can
this gentleman hear

241
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,770
an ant scratching
its back legs at 50 yards,

242
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,330
he's also
the unofficial chairman

243
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,170
of the Adrian Edmonson
Lookalike Society.

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,330
Right on.

245
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,670
SARAH: So, if you're not
scared of ghosts,

246
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,330
you're scared of that.

247
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,700
How are you feeling
about tonight?

248
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,800
Are you a bit nervous at all?

249
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,200
We will see.

250
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,670
Erm, how about you, Chris?

251
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,170
I'm okay.

252
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,970
-Are you ready to go in then?
-Yeah.

253
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,330
Okay.
Well, we'll see you later.

254
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,970
And... (CHUCKLES)

255
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,230
(ALL CLAPPING)

256
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,030
It's time to go
once more into the breach.

257
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,400
-Do I have to go first?
-CHRIS: After you.

258
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,300
Yeah, typical.
Come on then, chaps.

259
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,370
Hello?

260
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,100
Here we are.

261
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,270
Hi, Pam.
Now, oh, look here we are.

262
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,000
This is the burglar alarm that

263
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,630
Alan Demescu
was talking about.

264
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,230
Can we make ourselves at home?

265
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,400
Kim, Suzanne.

266
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,700
Can I join you for a bit of
apple bobbing, do you think?

267
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,670
Well, we'll let Sarah
and her jolly team

268
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,370
settle down there
for the night.

269
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,630
I wonder if they'll remain
as jolly as that

270
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,630
all evening.
We shall find out.

271
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,230
Er, Dr Pascoe, let me ask you,

272
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,700
why did you first of all...

273
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,830
Why did you choose
that particular house?

274
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,200
Well, it was a decision we
made over many weeks really.

275
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,730
What happened is that

276
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,000
we ran a computer programme

277
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,830
of all the haunted locations
in the UK,

278
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,030
and then we did a census of
all the various investigators,

279
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,770
and they were all
unanimous that

280
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,230
Foxhill had more tangible
phenomena on record than...

281
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,000
I was gonna say any place
in the world,

282
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,030
but certainly
any place in the UK.

283
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,830
We'll see evidence of that,
of course, later on
in the programme.

284
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,370
What's the chance,
do you think,
of us seeing anything tonight?

285
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,400
I don't honestly know.

286
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,000
Sometimes
we saw nothing for weeks,

287
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,730
and then, other times
things were coming through

288
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,970
thick and fast,
I mean, so much so that

289
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,200
we had difficulty
logging it all.

290
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,630
I mean,
some nights it was like, er...

291
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,870
(EXHALES) Being in a circus
or a war zone or something.

292
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,730
-"A war zone"?
-It was that bad.

293
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,100
What about Halloween?

294
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,100
Will that make any difference,
do you think?

295
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,070
Yeah, I think it will.

296
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,300
Certainly, there were
more reports on Halloween

297
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,900
than almost any other night
of the year.

298
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,030
But maybe that's because
people expect to see things.

299
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,670
-I'm taking out no bets.
I'm hopeful.
-(CHUCKLES)

300
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,100
All right.
Yes, we're all hopeful.

301
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,400
Let's take a phone call.

302
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,630
Mike Smith,
what you got for us?

303
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,900
This is Emma Stableford,
and she's from Slough.

304
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,800
Thank you. Emma? Emma, hello.

305
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,070
-EMMA: (ON PHONE) Hello?
-Yeah.

306
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
EMMA: (ON PHONE)
I did have a story,

307
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,930
but there's actually
something else I'd like
to say to Dr Pascoe.

308
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,170
-MICHAEL: Go on.
-EMMA: (ON PHONE)
But I feel a bit foolish.

309
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,870
Oh, don't worry
about that, Emma.

310
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,300
Never worries me.

311
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,770
EMMA: (ON PHONE)
Well, you know,
at the beginning

312
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,300
when you showed
the real footage
of that haunted bedroom?

313
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, I know it was dark,

314
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,330
but I was sure I could
see a figure standing behind

315
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,300
against the wall,
just by the curtain.

316
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,770
Very, very faint,
but definitely a figure there.

317
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,170
A woman.

318
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
A person's body, at least.

319
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,930
Standing there
in a black dress.

320
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,400
Emma, I've examined
that particular piece of film

321
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,970
many times
and so I'm not sure...

322
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,100
MICHAEL: I'll tell you
what to do, Emma,

323
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,630
if you can actually spot up

324
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,270
the specific point
on that tape

325
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,770
where you saw this figure...

326
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,630
Tell one of our operators,

327
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,630
we'll actually spool it
back to the point
where you tell us,

328
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,030
and then I'll get
Dr Pascoe here

329
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,700
to have a good look at it.
Okay?

330
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,870
-Great.
-EMMA: (ON PHONE) Yeah.

331
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,230
All right. Thanks for calling.

332
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,100
Before you go, Emma,

333
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,100
could you give
a full description of
what you thought you saw

334
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,300
to somebody manning the phones
please? Can you do that?

335
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,030
-EMMA: (ON PHONE)
Yeah, I will.
-Great.

336
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,370
-MICHAEL: Okay, Emma,
thanks a lot.
-Thank you.

337
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,330
-Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
-EMMA: (ON PHONE) Bye.

338
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,670
I tell you what we'll do.

339
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,130
While we search
for that piece of tape,

340
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,970
let's find out
what Sarah's up to.

341
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,400
MIKE: Sarah,
did you hear that?

342
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,800
Somebody thinks they've seen
a presence in the house.

343
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,670
-Today?
-MIKE: You've not noticed
anything this evening,

344
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,930
-have you?
-No, nothing to
report from here yet,

345
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,330
except how absolutely useless
I am at apple-bobbing.

346
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,700
Come on, girls.
Yes, you've done it,
I can see.

347
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,170
(KNOCKING)

348
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,830
-Who's that?
-(KNOCKING)

349
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,030
Can you hear that?

350
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Can you hear this?
Are you hearing...
(KNOCKING)
It's coming from in...
-(GROWLING)
-(SCREAMING)

351
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,870
You...

352
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,630
(ALL LAUGHING)

353
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:58,030
You are a complete
and utter beast.

354
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,370
"Beast"? I got it!
Look at that. It's worse
than Mike Smith, isn't it?

355
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,870
I don't know though.

356
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,270
Is it your idea, this, Smithy?
You set this up?

357
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,930
Well, I had a bet
with your husband,

358
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,670
I could get a four-letter-word
uttered on television,

359
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,230
I nearly did, as well. It was
"beast". B-E-A-S-T. Beast.

360
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,830
You're a class act.

361
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,030
I think that is such
a cheap shot, I have to say.

362
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,800
I mean, you know, I can take a
joke with the best of them,

363
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,730
but we're all holed up
in here...

364
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,270
Well, I'm sorry if
I'm being insensitive,
but it is my brief.

365
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,730
They said, "Craig, come along,
be insensitive."

366
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,400
Can you just get out
of the way a minute?

367
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,970
-You're in the middle
of my close-up.
-Oh, with pleasure.

368
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,700
They were in on it.
They were in on it.

369
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,000
-Give me an apple.
Give me an apple.
-You were?

370
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,630
Sorry, chaps, I love you all,

371
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,130
if there's any ghosts,
keep them to yourselves.

372
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,630
-SARAH: Love us
and leave us, go on.
-I love you.

373
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,830
You needn't smirk, Mike Smith,
you were in on this.

374
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,130
I think you're in a certain
amount of trouble

375
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,200
with her indoors
for that little situation.

376
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,370
I'm sorry there, Doctor.
Our producer, in fact, created
a happening in the house

377
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,330
just in case we were on a wild
ghost hunt, so to speak.

378
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,630
-DR PASCOE: We aren't,
I promise you.
-All right.

379
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,630
Well, let's go back to
Sarah now.

380
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,300
Sarah, when you're ready
let's hear the real story,

381
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,300
the strange happenings
at Foxhill Drive.

382
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,400
And by the way, have you
got over your shock yet?

383
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,300
Yes, I have recovered now,
thank you, Michael.

384
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,270
Let me fill you in on what's
been happening here so far.

385
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,930
Let's face it,
there's violence

386
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,870
at some time or another
in every part of London,

387
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,030
and this estate
is no exception.

388
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,630
But there are some days,
and certainly nights

389
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,900
when Mrs Early
and her two daughters

390
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,630
would rather be
out on the street

391
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,830
than right here,
within their own four walls.

392
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,000
Let's go upstairs
for a moment.

393
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,100
It all began in here
on December the 28th, 1991.

394
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,030
Who was the first person
to experience something?

395
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,100
Suzanne.

396
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,230
We had a bit of an argument

397
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,800
because Suzanne wanted
to stay up and watch some film
and I wouldn't let her.

398
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,000
-Go on, Suze,
you say what happened.
-No, you say.

399
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,930
She went to bed about,

400
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,630
-Erm...
-I was in bed.

401
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,030
Mum came in to tuck me in,

402
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,870
instead she just stood
by the bed, looking at me.

403
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,700
At least I thought it was her.

404
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,370
And then she just turned
and went.

405
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,100
The thing is, I didn't
tuck them in that night.

406
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,830
I always do,

407
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,900
but that night I fell asleep
in front of the television.

408
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,230
I told her
she must have been dreaming.

409
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,700
Then a few days later,
it was my room.

410
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,730
SARAH: Should we go and
have a look?

411
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,970
A few days later,

412
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,200
these terrible noises woke me
coming from the walls

413
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,370
like a bat, like a thudding.

414
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,900
All around you?

415
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,030
Yes, like the whole room
was going to come apart.

416
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,800
Did anybody else hear it?

417
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,130
Yes, Suzanne and Kim heard it.

418
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,070
Kimmy, if you heard it too,

419
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
what sort of a noise was it?

420
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,630
(HITTING THE FLOOR)

421
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,700
We were screaming,
I was shouting,

422
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,870
"What is it? What is it?"

423
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,970
Well, I didn't know
what to say,
they were that terrified.

424
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,670
So, I said it was pipes.

425
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,770
You know, the central heating.

426
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,730
So, afterwards,
whenever Kim heard something

427
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,730
she'd say, "It's Pipes.
Pipes is here."

428
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,200
SARAH: So by this time, Kim,
you could actually feel
something as well, could you?

429
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,830
Whereabouts was it
coming from?

430
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,630
There.

431
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,130
SARAH: What is it
that's over there?

432
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,630
Pipes, that's where he hides.

433
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,670
SARAH: Does he live there?

434
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,300
Where does he live then?
Anywhere?

435
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,330
On the stairs.

436
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,930
SARAH: Kim, how do you know
he lives down there?

437
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,300
Because I saw him
through the crack.

438
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,970
He was there.
He was staring at me.

439
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,230
SARAH: What happened
after you saw him?

440
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,030
I drew a picture of him.

441
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,100
-SARAH: Have you kept it?
-Yeah.

442
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,330
-SARAH: Can we have a look?
-Yeah.

443
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,200
Let's have a look.

444
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,200
Was that exactly how he looked
when you saw him?

445
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,670
KIM: Yeah, he was disgusting.

446
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,030
Really disgusting.

447
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,630
It's a good picture. Yeah.

448
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,630
No. (WHISPERING)
Keep it. It's a present.

449
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,800
Oh, thank you very much.

450
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,070
I'll tell you what, why don't
we put it up somewhere
where everyone can see it?

451
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,830
-Yeah.
-Where's a good place?

452
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,130
On the fridge in the kitchen.

453
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,170
-On the fridge?
-KIM: Yeah.

454
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,170
SARAH: There we go.

455
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,870
Will it be all right putting
him up there, do you think?

456
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,100
Yeah, because
he likes everything freezing

457
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,200
and really cold.

458
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,230
Pam, there was something else,
wasn't there?

459
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,330
Yes, there's also this.

460
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,230
Once I looked in Suzie's
exercise book from school.

461
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,170
SARAH: Oh.
PAMELA: I was so shocked,

462
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,330
I said to her,
"Did you write this?"

463
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,270
I was going to hit her,
I was so mad.

464
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,900
But it wasn't me.
I don't even write like that.

465
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,730
Then I said to her,
"Who was it, then?

466
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,370
-"Who was it?"
-SARAH: Yeah.

467
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,600
Who or what?

468
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,230
Michael.

469
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,330
Lots of questions there
that need answering,

470
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,900
perhaps we'll have a chance to
answer some of them tonight.

471
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,600
Just actually hearing
in my earpiece that

472
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,900
Mike Smith has some news.

473
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:26,970
Mike, what's happening?

474
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,700
Thanks very much. Thank you.

475
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,270
I've got eight or nine
phone calls here

476
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,600
which are like
Emma Stableford's

477
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,900
we had earlier on.

478
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,330
They too have seen
a mysterious dark figure

479
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,870
in the background of that shot
in the children's bedroom.
Michael?

480
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,730
"Dark, mysterious figure,"
Doctor.

481
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,800
Have we got that
sequence ready yet?

482
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,170
-Yes.
-Can we see that tape?

483
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,300
Yeah, I think we can.
I think we can see it

484
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,100
right now.
Let's roll the tape.

485
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,630
There you are,
up there on the screen,

486
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,200
that's the tape you wanted,
isn't it?

487
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,170
I can't sleep.
Turn the light off.

488
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,730
Mum said if you don't...

489
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,400
All right. All right.

490
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,330
MICHAEL: Now, this is
the point where
Emma Stableford,

491
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,630
our caller,
said she could identify
that dark mysterious figure

492
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,330
in the corner of the room.

493
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,800
I don't see anything myself,
do you?

494
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,770
DR PASCOE: Can we rewind it?
MICHAEL: Sure.

495
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,070
-Let's rewind it.
-Can we play it again?

496
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,270
Can we play it back, BTL?
There you are.

497
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,300
Back a bit more.

498
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,800
-Yeah. Is that all right?
-Yeah.

499
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,770
-Can we go forward slowly?
-Sure, sure.

500
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,230
MICHAEL: All right.
I'm doing that now.

501
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,630
-That's slow enough?
-Uh-huh.

502
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,830
I can't see anything now
myself. False alarm?

503
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,270
Yeah, I think
I can see what's happened.

504
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,870
Do you see the shadow
cast by the curtain there?

505
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,270
-See on the curtain,
on the left-hand side.
-MICHAEL: Not really.

506
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,400
I tell you what we'll do.
We've got a piece of,

507
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,130
I don't know... Wheel
that piece of sophisticated

508
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,830
technology in here.

509
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,670
You can actually use a light
pencil on the screen there

510
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,070
just to identify exactly
the area that
you're talking about.

511
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,770
-Is this it?
-Yes, that's right.

512
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Just draw on it as you would
a normal pencil.

513
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,730
DR PASCOE: All right,
I think...

514
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,030
There's a sort of shape there
a face maybe,

515
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,630
and a human form

516
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,630
I think the shadow's caused.

517
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,630
I wonder if it's that thing,
you know,
where you put your...

518
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,030
Your dressing gown on
the back of the bedroom door.

519
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,330
At a certain light,
you look at it
in the middle of the night

520
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,130
and it looks like
a human form or face.

521
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,400
I mean, it's easily done,
isn't it?

522
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,830
I think that's it. Exactly.

523
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,900
-"Faces in the fire."
-Yes.

524
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,230
Human perception is such that

525
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,730
the first thing
you attempt to create

526
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,230
in any abstract shape
is a human face or form.

527
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,870
Okay.

528
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,330
All right, then, well,
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

529
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,000
but I'll tell you
what we'll do,

530
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,030
let's go back over to
Foxhill Drive

531
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,630
and learn about the toll
that living there

532
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,730
has taken on the children's
mother, Pamela Early.

533
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,330
SARAH: Pam, I know
this has all been
a nightmare for you.

534
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,030
But what's been the worst
moment so far, do you think?

535
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,030
I'll show you.

536
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,230
I've got to get this
done properly.

537
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,630
My husband... My ex-husband

538
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,930
used to develop
his own photos in a darkroom
under the stairs.

539
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,300
A "glory hole", as we used to
call it when I was a kid.

540
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,730
Why have you boarded it up
like this then?

541
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,200
PAMELA: Well...
(SIGHS) One night last January

542
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,370
I got it into my head

543
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,130
to try and find
one of my letter...

544
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,770
The solicitor's letters
about my divorce.

545
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,630
Erm, all of a sudden,
the door stuck.

546
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,030
Like somebody was trying
and pushing it from outside.

547
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,870
SARAH: You were inside
by this time?

548
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,270
Yeah.

549
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,700
I shoved, I tried to get out,

550
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,700
and then I started to panic.

551
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,630
It was like a coffin,
I couldn't breathe.

552
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,370
I started screaming
for Kimmy and Suzie,

553
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,030
but all I could hear
was my banging.

554
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,730
And all I could hear was
Kimmy shouting,

555
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,800
"It's Pipes, Mum, Pipes.
Pipes is here."

556
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,000
SARAH: That's awful.

557
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,070
The girls got
you out eventually.

558
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,700
The thing is,

559
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,200
when I was in there I swear,
as God is my witness,

560
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,700
I heard, I...

561
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,330
Felt this man in there,
with me,

562
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,300
breathing right up
against my face.

563
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,170
Like strong,
like rotten cabbage.

564
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,300
I nearly died.

565
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,730
And... And when I got out,

566
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,830
my head went, my knees went.

567
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,730
Pam, let's go sit down.
Come on.

568
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,270
Tell us what happened next.

569
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,400
Well, after glory hole,

570
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,000
erm, I wrote to the Council

571
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,400
to try and get us moved.

572
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,200
SARAH: Mmm-hmm.

573
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,930
But they wouldn't
take it seriously.

574
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,270
You know, like I was lying.

575
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,630
Just don't want to
know really.

576
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,670
We saw a social worker,

577
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,330
and they said we should
all see a psychiatrist.

578
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,800
Tell me what happened
when the newspapers got
their teeth into the story.

579
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,970
That was a disaster.

580
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,670
-Look at these.
You got a lot of coverage.
-Yeah.

581
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,830
"'I believe in the Devil,'
says Spook House Mother."

582
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,070
Did you say that?

583
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,200
PAMELA: (CHUCKLES)
No, I didn't, no.

584
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,330
SARAH: Here's "Power of Evil."

585
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,700
PAMELA: Everyone was
very friendly, but in the end,

586
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,730
they all made us look
even more like idiots.

587
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,870
So I went to the local TV.

588
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,630
-Can we have a look
at that, actually?
-Yeah.

589
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,800
Here we are.

590
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,370
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

591
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,100
I told her
it was the central heating.

592
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,270
So ever since then,
she calls the noises "Pipes".

593
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,100
So, Kim, aren't you
a little bit afraid?

594
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,000
Sometimes.

595
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,630
MAN: (ON TV) Why? Do you think
Mr Pipes has come to hurt you?

596
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,230
I think he's come
to hurt everybody.

597
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,670
I think he wants to do
nasty things.

598
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,770
MAN: (ON TV) Okay.
Thank you very much.

599
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,700
Now...

600
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,830
Pam, thanks for letting us
see that.

601
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,630
They're ready for you now
in the other studio.

602
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,400
-All right.
-Yeah.

603
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,730
Pamela's just going to
make her way outside now
to our mini-studio.

604
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,170
She'll be there
waiting to take your calls.

605
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,870
In the meantime, let's go
back to our main studio.

606
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,770
And, Sarah,
thank you very much indeed.

607
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,130
Dr Pascoe, what was
your introduction to
the Early family?

608
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,170
DR PASCOE: Well,
I saw that programme

609
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,630
that we've just seen
an extract from

610
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,630
and I offered to help
if I could.

611
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,200
MICHAEL: When you met
Mrs Early then,

612
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,300
was she then at
the end of her tether?

613
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,200
Yes, I'd had
some experience of a fairly
violent poltergeist case

614
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,870
in Heidelberg, Germany.

615
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,870
So, I knew what it could do to
a family, emotionally.

616
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,100
I see. Well, I believe that
Mrs Early has joined us now.

617
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,630
Pamela, hello.
Thanks for joining us.

618
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,230
-Hello.
-MICHAEL: Yeah.

619
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,370
And thanks also for allowing
our cameras into your home.

620
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,370
That can't have been an easy
decision to have taken.

621
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,330
Well, Suzanne was getting
fed up with the jibes
she was getting at school.

622
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,730
Erm, with the papers calling
us liars and everything.

623
00:26:53,770 --> 00:27:00,300
And she said, "Mum, Dr Pascoe
wants us to do this BBC thing.

624
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,670
"So, let's do it.
And let's show everyone,

625
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,230
"and then,
they'll have to believe us."

626
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,100
Erm, Pamela, I understand that
you're quite keen to share

627
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,900
your experience
with our callers.

628
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,230
Yes.

629
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,400
And I want to tell
everyone that, erm,

630
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,070
they're not going mad like I
thought I was sometimes.

631
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,370
-That's right.
-All right.

632
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,800
Well, we've got some callers
on the line now.

633
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,400
Let's take our first caller.
Mike Smith, who is it?

634
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,230
This is Sandra Hughes
from Sussex.

635
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,130
Right. Let's pick up
the phones, Dr Pascoe.

636
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,130
Sandra, hello.

637
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,930
SANDRA: (ON PHONE)
Oh, he... Hello.

638
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,830
This is just that
when I was a girl,

639
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,670
I was brought up in
a house in Brighton,

640
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,730
and we had a ghost.

641
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,000
And we'd often
find things broken

642
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,630
and, you know,
those sorts of things.

643
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,030
You're not alone,
Sandra, honestly.

644
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:49,230
SANDRA: (ON PHONE)
And it's sort of coming out
about this boy who died there,

645
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,800
and how it's affected me.

646
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:55,270
Because at the time,
I didn't realise
how much it affected me.

647
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,000
That's...
That's all I wanted
to say, really.

648
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,830
Thank you, Sandra,
for your call. Thanks a lot.

649
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,200
Thank you too, Mrs Early,
for joining us.

650
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,130
Well, if you'd stay in
the studio, then we'll come
back to you in just a moment.

651
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,900
There are one or two
other things to talk about
first of all.

652
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,230
Thanks a lot.

653
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,130
Now, what I want to talk
about now, Dr Pascoe,

654
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,970
is this book of yours, which
I'll show to the camera there.

655
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,200
This is called
Angels of the Odd.

656
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,830
And it's a book
that you wrote,

657
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,830
your account of your
investigation into this case.

658
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,170
And you also made a film
at the same time.

659
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,030
We've got an extract
from the film.

660
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,070
Perhaps you could talk us
through what's happening here.

661
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,400
-MAN: All right?
-Yeah.

662
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,000
DR PASCOE: Well, we did
extensive interviews.

663
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,200
And we also used
the Ganzfeld technique.

664
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,400
MICHAEL: That's what
we're seeing now.

665
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,900
And that's where
all the senses...

666
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,370
Sensory inputs are
blocked off.

667
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,930
DR PASCOE: Deprived, yeah.
MICHAEL: Deprived, yes.

668
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,000
And you just feed in
the white sound...

669
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,770
DR PASCOE: Yeah.
MICHAEL: White noise,
through the headphones there.

670
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,270
DR PASCOE: Bright light.
MICHAEL: Yeah.

671
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,070
DR PASCOE: Now, that's when
we would hear the voice.

672
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,030
"The voice"? Well, we should
hear the voice actually.

673
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,770
Let's hear it now.
Because this is intriguing.

674
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,030
Across here.

675
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,870
I should say that this tape
is completely undoctored.

676
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,170
There's no edit
on it whatsoever.

677
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,130
All right. We should also
warn our viewers
of a nervous disposition

678
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,270
that there are things
on this tape that they might
find a little bit distressing.

679
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,030
At one point, we filled
Suzanne's mouth
with coloured liquid,

680
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,030
and we sealed her lips
with tape,

681
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,330
and the voice continued
with absolutely no change
in quality whatsoever.

682
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,630
Let's hear it.

683
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,670

It's suddenly stopped moving.

693
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,230
And everything seems
to have gone quiet now.

Bizarre. And chilling too.

711
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,400
Well, forensic scientists
at Cambridge
examined the voice recording,

712
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,400
and compared it to Suzanne's
normal speech pattern.

713
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,070
And they defined it as the
voices of two separate people.

714
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,030
Two people, yeah.

715
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,230
-And, erm, we asked Suzanne
to see, if she could...
-Oh, my God!

716
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,970
DR PASCOE: ...imitate
the voice recording.

717
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,400
And she was unable to do so
for more than a few seconds.

00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,370
MICHAEL: That's her,
trying it there.
DR PASCOE: Yeah.

-Try it again.

-MICHAEL: She can't do it.
-No. Even under hypnosis,
we tried that.

00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,270
-Really? And the same result?
-Still the...

723
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,200
What other evidence
do we have, Doctor?

724
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,900
Well, over the months,
Alan Demescu, my partner,
and I heard numerous noises...

725
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,870
Thuds, bangs, scratching on
the walls, knocking.

726
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,670
The sort of normal noises
you associate
with poltergeist activity?

727
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,130
What about this here, though?

728
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,700
Ah, well, this is...
This is my favourite, I think.

729
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,970
This pillow moved
diagonally to within
about a foot of my face.

730
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,330
Now, it's impossible to fake
that. How do you fake that?

731
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,400
MICHAEL: (CHUCKLING)
I don't know really at all.

732
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,670
Let's have a look at some more
evidence over here.

733
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,670
This is the wreckage evidence,
if you like.

734
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,770
This is an extraordinary
assembly of...

735
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,400
-There is this cup here
for instance.
-Yeah.

736
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,630
Right? Let me show that
in the camera there.

737
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,830
Now, how did
these breakages occur?

738
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,300
-Were they dropped?
-DR PASCOE: Well, no...

739
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,130
-The army did some analysis
of this for us.
-Yeah.

740
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:10,830
And they said it'd been caused
by intense temperature change.

741
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,970
Not by impact or shock.

742
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,770
MICHAEL: Really?

743
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,930
-This temperature...
There you are.
-DR PASCOE: Yeah.

744
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,930
MICHAEL: Look,
the headless lady.

745
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,300
And lots more guys here,
and crockery.

746
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,200
-Look at that.
-DR PASCOE: Yeah.

747
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,200
And clocks or watches
just stop when they're
in the house.

748
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,170
I mean, I just gave up
wearing one. There's no point.

749
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,630
MICHAEL: And the favourites
in situations like this...

750
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,630
God, the spoons that are bent.

751
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:36,070
Quite remarkable.

752
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,830
Couple of regular little Uri
Gellers, those sisters.

753
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,170
Yes, they weren't even
in the room sometimes.

754
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,230
You'd just open the drawer
and they are there.

755
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,030
-And you saw all this happen?
-Yeah, many times.

756
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,000
Many, many times.

757
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,670
Extraordinary.

758
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,100
Let's now look at another
piece of evidence, Doctor.

759
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:57,300
And that's the situation where
Suzanne's face at times is

760
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,770
covered with marks,
with lesions.

761
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Before I talk to you
about that,

762
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,700
I'd like to talk to Suzanne.

763
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,770
And I think that...

764
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,270
Yeah, there they are.

765
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,400
-We're on. Yeah. Here we are.
-We're going live over there.

766
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,170
So I'd like to talk
to Suzanne.

767
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,900
Suzanne, when did you first
get these marks on your face?

768
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,200
When did they first show?

769
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,100
About July, the first one was.

770
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,100
It was horrible.

771
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,300
Well, I'd just wake up
and it would feel like
someone was all over me.

772
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,870
And in fact, we've got there,
Dr Pascoe,

773
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,630
we've got some of the pictures
that were taken there

774
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,800
of the face of that girl

775
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,830
with these extraordinary marks
on them.

776
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,870
DR PASCOE: Alan and I watched
them appear on her face,

777
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,200
quite literally in front of
our eyes.

778
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,870
MICHAEL: There's
another shot there. Look.

779
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,000
Remarkable.

780
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,630
Now we've seen, Dr Pascoe...

781
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,230
We've seen the evidence
that you've collected so far.

782
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,030
I'd like your theory.

783
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,030
From what we've seen,
do you think that the

784
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,100
poltergeist activity,
such that it is,

785
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,970
is now centred on Suzanne?

786
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,300
Well, certainly as a female
approaching puberty,

787
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,700
she does conform
to the classic
typical poltergeist focus.

788
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,700
-Yeah.
-Broken family background,

789
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,270
she's introverted.

790
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,030
She tends maybe to direct
her stress and anxiety inwards

791
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:18,000
until it has nowhere to go,
and then... Bam.

792
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,030
I see.

793
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,900
I think we've still got
Mrs Early there, in our
outside broadcast studio.

794
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,700
If she's... Yes.
There you are.

795
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,230
Mrs Early, I don't know quite
if you heard that,

796
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,270
what Dr Pascoe was saying.

797
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,170
Well, she said that Suzanne
was the classic
typical poltergeist focus.

798
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,900
She was the person that all
this energy was focusing on.

799
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,630
What do you think about that?

800
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,830
Well, there's nothing wrong
with my Suzie. I know that.

801
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:47,400
If my Suzie's funny,
well, how does that explain
the other things like, erm,

802
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:50,630
like the glory hole?
It doesn't and it can't.

803
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,800
So you disagree with
Dr Pascoe's theory that

804
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:56,370
Suzanne's psychological
problems are the cause
of these disturbances.

805
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,330
I think what you're saying
really is, in fact, that you
believe it's a natural ghost.

806
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,200
Don't you, Lin?

807
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,370
Pam, I'm not
disagreeing with you.

808
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,130
Please believe me.
I'm on your side.

809
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,870
I know that
there's something there.

810
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,800
I'm just trying to understand
what it is.

811
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,100
A poltergeist
can be location-based
or person-based.

812
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,630
I mean, who knows?
Maybe this is both.

813
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,670
I mean, of course a lot
of people would have it that
there's nothing there at all.

814
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,000
Yeah, well, a lot of people
would have it at one time that
you couldn't walk on the moon.

815
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:25,130
All right. Well, in order to
avoid any accusations of bias,

816
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,070
I'd like to bring in
physicist Emilio Sylvestri.

817
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,630
A former member of the
sceptic society, CSICOP,

818
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:34,870
the Committee for the
Scientific Investigation
for Claims of the Paranormal.

819
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,400
He's in New York.

820
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,770
Good evening, Dr Sylvestri.

821
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,870
Good evening.

822
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,930
Thank you for joining us.
You've looked at the evidence
in this case.

823
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,900
I'd like to hear your
conclusions. What are they?

824
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,130
Well, I think
it's pretty obvious

825
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,800
there's nothing in the tape
that couldn't be faked.

826
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,670
The bedroom footage is
totally inconclusive.

827
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,670
It could all be done
with wires, for all we know.

828
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,370
DR PASCOE: And the legions
on Suzanne's face?

829
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,870
Scratched by her fingernails.

830
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,670
DR PASCOE: She's not lying.
Believe her.

831
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,230
I'd love to.

832
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,670
The same as I'd love to
believe I'm going to heaven,

833
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,000
but... Doesn't make it a
scientific fact.

834
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,870
DR PASCOE: But if people do
believe in something,

835
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,000
surely, we shouldn't
discount it.

836
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,670
I mean, it's all part of
human experience and that's
what we're studying.

837
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,070
Well... Fine, fine.

838
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,630
But is it measurable?

839
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,900
Is it provable? No...

840
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,830
For years, parapsychologists
have been trying to prove
their loony theories

841
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,370
in laboratory conditions,

842
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,130
and they can't.

843
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:30,030
Yeah, that's right. We can't.
That's where we went wrong.

844
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,630
There are some things you
can't demonstrate in a lab.

845
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,100
Show me falling in love
in a lab.

846
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,870
Show me poetic inspiration
in a lab.

847
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,870
You can't. You've got to
get out of the lab
and into real life,

848
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,070
and that's what we're trying
to do tonight.

849
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,700
These people are not
deceiving us or themselves.
Look at them.

850
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,800
They're in trauma for God's
sake. Why would they do it
to themselves?

851
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,630
The Early family are suffering
just like people who've
had murder bereavements,

852
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,930
or plane crashes.

853
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,630
The only difference is that
nobody says that they don't
believe in plane crashes.

854
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,630
But most of us
don't believe that people
come back from them.

855
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,770
See, that's...

856
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,130
What you're always forgetting,
Emilio, is that you have
a belief system, too.

857
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,100
Your belief system is
blanket denial.

858
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,630
You joke about it because
you're afraid to face it.

859
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,270
(SCOFFS) That old chestnut.

860
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,000
Look, Lin, you ought
to be selling crystals
on Venice Beach,

861
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,870
or palm reading,

862
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,400
or a counsellor, a confidant,
a guide maybe.

863
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:24,070
But a scientist?
I don't think so.

864
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,870
MICHAEL:
Dr Sylvestri, for the moment,
thank you very much indeed.

865
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,400
I hope you'll stay with us
in our studio in New York,

866
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,130
and keep an eye on
what's happening here,

867
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,370
and from time to time, give us
a comment on proceedings.

868
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,900
Thanks for joining us.

869
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,030
Well, there you are, Lin.

870
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,700
What do you think about that?

871
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:40,070
CSICOP people have nothing
to do with parapsychology.

872
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,700
They're just a sign of
the times.

873
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:42,770
In what way?

874
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,130
They're the last
of the materialists.

875
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,370
Like the last
of the dinosaurs.

876
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,900
The world's changing.

877
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,670
Good doctor made you cross,
didn't he?

878
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,730
No.

879
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,130
Right. Do or do now.
Let's go straight over
to Sarah in Foxhill Drive.

880
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,270
Hang on.

881
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,170
Sarah, what's happening there?

882
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,370
It's quite quiet, actually.

883
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,100
A bit too quiet.

884
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,300
Though, I must say,
earlier on,

885
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,800
Suze turned off Dr Sylvestri.

886
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,670
I don't think
she was that enamoured.

887
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,300
What does he know?
He's not here.

888
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,700
MICHAEL: Well, in the moment
we've got here now, Sarah,

889
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,100
perhaps you could tell us
that ghost story
you told us about earlier on.

890
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,000
Oh, yes, all right.

891
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,370
Well, it was sort of
a ghost story.

892
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
-It happened...
-I can start another one.

893
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,830
A couple of months ago now.

894
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,230
We were staying at some
friends of ours' home.

895
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,630
They live in the Cotswolds.

896
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,100
Beautiful 15th, 16th
century house.

897
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,630
And one night,

898
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:35,630
I was woken up by the sound
of this harpsichord music.

899
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,000
It was like chamber music.

900
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,170
But, you know, when a noise
comes into your dream,

901
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,330
and you're not quite sure
it's in the dream,

902
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,230
or whether it's
actually happening.

903
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,230
It was that kind of effect.

904
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,300
But it woke me up nonetheless.

905
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,900
And when I tried to get back
to sleep again,

906
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,330
I could still hear it.

907
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:56,070
But all I could see was this
Indian woman's face.

908
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,900
And she had her hair sort of
pulled across her forehead
and then tightly back.

909
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,670
And kohl around her eyes.

910
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,400
And her eyes were going
from side to side.

911
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,770
You know, like in
Indian dancing.

912
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,670
And slowly, the eyes lifted up
and rolled right back
until they were white,

913
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,700
and then the face went.

914
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:15,170
The next morning,
I couldn't wait to tell
everybody about this.

915
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,930
And the people
whose house it is...

916
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,730
They told me that the house
had once belonged
to the viceroy of India.

917
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:28,170
And he had had two
Indian concubines living
in the house with him.

918
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,770
And when they died,

919
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,970
he couldn't bury them
in consecrated ground.

920
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,970
He wasn't allowed to. So he
buried them out in his garden.

921
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,400
And there had been talk
in the village

922
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:44,000
of actually digging up
the grave to see what else
was down there.

923
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,330
And it became very clear to me
that this was a sort of
message to say,

924
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,930
"No, don't.
They mustn't do it."

925
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:53,200
And so, when I found out that
they weren't in fact planning
to do anything with the grave,

926
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,600
they wouldn't dream of it,

927
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,630
I went back up to the bedroom,

928
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,870
and I just sort of said,
"Don't worry.
Nothing's going to happen."

929
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,230
And it was as though
the atmosphere changed
straightaway.

930
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,830
I have to say Smithy was
a bit scared the next night.

931
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,330
He wouldn't admit it,
but he was.

932
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,130
But nothing happened.

933
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,170
And it was as though
everything had gone
calm again.

934
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,630
But the important thing here,
it wasn't scary. At all.

935
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,270
I mean, the music and the
vision was very beautiful.

936
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,200
But... That's why I wanted
to do this programme.

937
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,630
'Cause it's intriguing.

938
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,630
-You all right?
-(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)

939
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,100
Okay, yeah.

940
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,230
Kim just wants to go to bed
now. It's a bit late.

941
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,670
What time do you normally
go to bed?

942
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,130
-8:00.
-8:00. Come on then.

943
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,670
You must be a bit tired.

944
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,370
KIM: Say hi to Mum.

945
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,130
SARAH: You want to just say hi
to Mum? Okay.

946
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,300
Well, tell you what?
If you look up
to that camera there...

947
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,070
-Yeah. Little thing there.
-That?

948
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,900
And you'll be speaking to her,
Kim. Say good night to her.

949
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:49,070
-Good night, Mum.
-Good night, love.
Sweet dreams.

950
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,030
Good night, Kim.

951
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,800
DR PASCOE:
Remember, there's nothing
to be scared of.

952
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,300
To bed.

953
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,800
You really think there's
nothing to be scared of?

954
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,770
SARAH: There we are.

955
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,870
Well, one says,
the paranormal's
no more scary than

956
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,770
the weather or the tides.

957
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,070
I mean, all those things
can harm us.

958
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,800
But we can also
understand them.

959
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,170
All right? Can I leave that
light on?

960
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,770
-Yeah. Good night.
-All right. Good night.

961
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,230
-Keep warm.
-Yep.

962
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,770
MICHAEL: So, Sarah,
got anything to report at all?

963
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,100
No. Nothing.

964
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,900
Just the cold.

965
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,870
It's typical, isn't it?

966
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,730
A house full of technology,
and nobody's bothered
to find out

967
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,300
whether central heating switch
is on.

968
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,970
You okay, Suzanne?

969
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,070
-Yes, I am.
-Got your crisps?

970
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,930
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Good. All right.

971
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,770
Now, guys, I think we've
earned ourselves a cup
of coffee, don't you?

972
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,070
MAN: Yeah.

973
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,370
Pam told me where
everything was, so...

974
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,670
It's just there.

975
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,800
Mike, how do you
take the coffee?

976
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,100
MIKE A: Black,
one sugar please.

977
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,300
SARAH: Okay.
What about you, Chris?

978
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,830
CHRIS: Milk, one sugar please.

979
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,800
There we are.

980
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,630
You know what?

981
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,630
I think I'd almost feel
happier if something
was happening.

982
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:07,300
It's sort of eerier
just waiting, really,
don't you find?

983
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:12,130
MIKE A: Well, I think,
I might've heard
something earlier. Sort of...

984
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,700
Just like an animal scratching
its feet, but

985
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,870
they don't record in this
camera at all.

986
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,330
-Really?
-MIKE A: Yeah.

987
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:21,370
CHRIS: And I noticed earlier
my watch had stopped.

988
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,630
-Really?
-CHRIS: Yeah.

989
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,930
What time? When?

990
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,330
CHRIS: Er, just before
we went on air.

991
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,870
DR PASCOE: I said watches
have a hard time.

992
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,400
Par for the course I'm afraid.

993
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,030
I'm fine.

994
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,630
Just as long as we all know,
eh?

995
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,370
MICHAEL: Don't spook yourself.

996
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,870
No, it's all right.

997
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,630
That's what
we're being paid for.

998
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,100
We're okay, anyway. Look.

999
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,700
We've got an old hand
to help us over here.

1000
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,800
Now I just put the kettle on.
Do you want a cup of tea
or coffee?

1001
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,770
-No, thanks. I'm having
orange juice, okay?
-All right.

1002
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,900
Can you get me a glass please?

1003
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:51,800
-SARAH: Where? They're just
up here in the cupboard.
-Yeah, that's right.

1004
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,200
While you're in the fridge,
just pass me some milk.

1005
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,830
Yeah. Sure.

1006
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:56,870
Whoo.

1007
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,230
A balancing act. There we are.

1008
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,770
-Mum!
-Hello, love.
Are you all right?

1009
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,030
Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you all right?

1010
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,100
Yes.

1011
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,830
MICHAEL: Well, there we are.
So far, so good.

1012
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,900
Now as you know,
we asked you to join our

1013
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,170
exploration of
the supernatural by telling us
your ghost story.

1014
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,130
Well, here's someone
with a tale to tell,

1015
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,370
who wants to conceal
his identity.

1016
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,230
We had this dreadful day, er,

1017
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,170
that first evening.

1018
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,930
with duvets being
tugged off me.

1019
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,200
Except for being
quite amusing, we'd been
laughing about it.

1020
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:35,270
It wasn't at all malevolent
or nasty.

1021
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,970
But this particular day,
it certainly was.

1022
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,100
One of the first incidents
that day...

1023
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,100
We were eating lunch and...

1024
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,300
I think it was mackerel
or something like that.

1025
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,630
We both looked down,
this is my half-sister and me,

1026
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:51,230
and saw
what looked like saliva

1027
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,400
all over the mackerel.

1028
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,130
Of course we couldn't eat it.

1029
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,630
And shortly after that,

1030
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:02,100
I found again what looked like
saliva on the front doorstep.

1031
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,370
Erm...

1032
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,900
I start...
I lost my temper with it.

1033
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,270
For the first time,
I say "it."

1034
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,030
This presence,
whatever it was...

1035
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,830
And I started shouting
and swearing.

1036
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,830
And immediately,
again, spit...

1037
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:15,170
What looked like spit
appeared on my shoes.

1038
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,170
As if in retaliation.

1039
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,830
And either shortly before
or shortly after this...

1040
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:26,830
Literally was disgusting.
(STAMMERING) We found
excrement smeared

1041
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:29,400
on a cupboard door
in the bathroom.

1042
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,800
We had already,
in fact found, er,

1043
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,970
such things in various parts
of the flat.

1044
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,300
This was the first time
we actually found anything
smeared like that on the door.

1045
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,170
So it had to be cleared up.
It was really horrible.

1046
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,300
And from someone
who believes in ghosts

1047
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,800
to someone who's not
quite sure.

1048
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,170
Let's join Craig Charles.

1049
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,030
Boo!

1050
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,070
I bet that scared you,
didn't it?

1051
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,930
No, this is not a mask.
This is Craig Charles, live,
you lucky people.

1052
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:58,030
And here we have
the thrill-seekers.

1053
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,700
Pillars of the community.

1054
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,800
All waiting to see if the
ghost is going to arrive.

1055
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,730
Welcome to Fright Night.

1056
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,970
Now I'm gonna give you
a little guided tour
of the community.

1057
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,030
And we're gonna meet some
people who are pretty upset
about some weird goings-on.

1058
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,100
And we're gonna go to a pretty
sinister place.

1059
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,770
Let's break into a little bit
of a jog, lads.

1060
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,130
Gets me fit, this jog.

1061
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,930
That's why I told Michael,
I hate Halloween.

1062
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,900
I hate apples.
I hate dud apples.

1063
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:23,930
I hate little kids all dressed
up in... Like the devil.

1064
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,630
I'm going to meet this woman,
Yvonne Etherly.

1065
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,870
And she's on this piece
of waste ground here, I think.

1066
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,770
And then she's gonna tell us
some pretty peculiar things.

1067
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,030
Erm, Yvonne Etherly.

1068
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,200
Yvonne? Which one...
You're Yvonne.

1069
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:40,370
Okay. Yvonne, can you...

1070
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,730
Can you tell me about some
of the things that've been
going on around here?

1071
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:45,700
Well, we live opposite Pam
at number 43,

1072
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,070
and one night, ages ago now,

1073
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,400
we heard all this banging.

1074
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,030
So we went to the front door,

1075
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,970
and it was obvious it was
coming from Pam's house.

1076
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,130
CRAIG: So what did you see?

1077
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,970
Well, the top window
was smashed,

1078
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,900
and Pam and Kimmy
were in the garden crying.

1079
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:00,300
So, we made them a cup of tea.

1080
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,130
And they just come in
into ours

1081
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:05,770
whenever they need to,
basically.

1082
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,100
CRAIG: It all sounds
a little bit weird.

1083
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:10,200
What's it like living in
England's Amityville?

1084
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,370
Well, it's no joke.

1085
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
I mean, it's not very funny.

1086
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,800
I mean, some really weird
and horrible things
happen around here.

1087
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:17,670
CRAIG: Well, what kind of
weird things?

1088
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,030
Well, there was that
wee girl that went missing.

1089
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,700
-Judy Weiland.
-Judy Weiland.

1090
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:22,830
It was in all the papers.

1091
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:24,130
What happened to her?

1092
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:28,370
We don't know. She just
disappeared and then...

1093
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,870
Well, I know you're always
reading about people that were
knifed and that sort of thing.

1094
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,630
But somebody was knifed around
here that was five years old.

1095
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,170
CRAIG: Five years old?

1096
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,870
Okay. Can you tell me a little
bit about this playground?

1097
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,000
Yeah.

1098
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,100
Shall I go in?

1099
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,270
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

1100
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,330
Well, it was this summer.

1101
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:49,230
My... My youngest son, Gary,
came running into the house
in a real state.

1102
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:53,770
So, when I calmed him down,
it seemed that they'd been
playing in here,

1103
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,330
and they'd found this
dead black Labrador.

1104
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,800
Where did they find it?

1105
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,330
It was about here.

1106
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,130
And how had it died?

1107
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,700
Well, it'd been cut open, like
something in a butcher's shop.

1108
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,000
Can you imagine the kind of
person that would do
something like that?

1109
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,030
Is that all that happened?

1110
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,330
Well, it was pregnant.

1111
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:12,000
There were foetuses
scattered all over.

1112
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,130
The kids wouldn't play
for weeks.

1113
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,770
I should imagine not.

1114
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,330
So as you can see, this is a
pretty sinister place.

1115
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:21,070
Now I'm gonna try and find the
guy who tried unsuccessfully

1116
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,130
to exorcise Foxhill Drive.

1117
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:25,800
A Mr Arthur Lacey.
Arthur Lacey?

1118
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,230
Arthur Lacey.
Come with me, Arthur.

1119
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:31,100
You got involved in your
professional capacity,
I believe.

1120
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:32,400
ARTHUR: Well, not exactly.

1121
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,400
By profession,
I'm a British Royal Guard.

1122
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:37,000
CRAIG: Ah. But in your
spare time, you're a medium?

1123
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,070
ARTHUR: Well,
I'm a spiritualist.
CRAIG: A spiritualist.

1124
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,870
ARTHUR: Yes, and through God,
I've been given the task,
when I can,

1125
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,670
to help spirits that may
have lost their way.

1126
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,230
So, you, erm...
You exorcised Foxhill Drive.

1127
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:51,900
Well, it wasn't
the Ruituale Romanum,
bell, book and candle.

1128
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,330
No, I simply went
and prayed with the family.

1129
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,770
And offered a guiding light
to whatever poor soul
might need it.

1130
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,870
And can you tell us
what happened?

1131
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,630
You know how they say that

1132
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,830
pigs can sense it before they
get to the slaughterhouse?

1133
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:06,930
Well, I had this
overwhelming sense of evil,

1134
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:10,230
of spiritual decay, is the
only way I can describe it as.

1135
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,300
Yeah, I was physically sick
for a week.

1136
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:14,170
I smelt blood on my hands.

1137
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,130
Something didn't want me
near it.

1138
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,930
Didn't believe it was dead.

1139
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:22,300
So do you believe there is
such a thing as...

1140
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,170
I don't know, an evil place?

1141
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,870
Well, there are degrees, yes,
shades in all places.

1142
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,300
I mean, anyone who buys
a house finds themselves

1143
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:31,800
weighing up these
vibrations subconsciously.

1144
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:34,070
You see, I think that

1145
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,900
just as we are the product of
our mothers and fathers
and their mothers and fathers,

1146
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:42,270
I think that places somehow
inherit the genes
in their past too, somehow.

1147
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,670
Yeah?

1148
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,730
Hey, trick-or-treaters
I think.

1149
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,230
-Hey, what's your name?
-Katie.

1150
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:48,800
-And your name?
-Billy.

1151
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:50,630
Billy and Katie.
Sounds a little bit like a...

1152
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:51,900
MICHAEL: Craig. Craig.

1153
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,930
I'm sorry to have to
cut you off there.

1154
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:57,400
In fact, I've just heard that
we've got to go back to Sarah.

1155
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,670
Sarah's got something
important for us.

1156
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,100
Sarah?

1157
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:02,630
Yes, what is it?

1158
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,230
What have you got?

1159
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,200
Yeah, we definitely got
something here.
Just look at this.

1160
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,100
Now, can you see this?

1161
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:10,800
MICHAEL:
I certainly can, clearly.

1162
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,670
SARAH: Well, there's no way
it could've gotten there.

1163
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,300
I thought maybe an old tomcat
had got in or something.

1164
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,200
DR PASCOE: Sarah,
when did you see this?

1165
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:20,100
Well, I took Suzanne
up to bed...

1166
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,230
In fact, all of us

down here at all.

a handkerchief?

the light fitting is working?

1171
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,230
Thanks. That's great.

1172

Yeah, we'll do that for you.

1173
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,630
Better turn the light
off first, hadn't I?

1174
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,230
All right. Okay.

1175
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:40,330

1176
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:44,570

enough to hold me.

on the ceiling?

1181
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:54,270

1182
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,200
DR PASCOE: No?

-SARAH: No,
this is all completely dry.

1184
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,330

come from below.
Is there any smell, Sarah?

1185
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,000
SARAH: No, nothing.

1186
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:05,070

the hanky, maybe?

1187
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,770

on that now.

1188

1190

No, no, can't smell
anything at all.

1191
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,230
DR PASCOE: No. Can you take
a sample for us?

1192
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:15,700
Have you got anything
that you could...

1193
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:17,830
Yeah, er, what can we use
for a sample?

1194
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,700
Something to swipe it up.

1196

that would do.

00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:25,300

use this to...
Can I give you this hanky?

Great. There.

See if we can suck some of
whatever it is up with this.

Here we are.

1201

DR PASCOE: You see, look,
it's typical.

1202
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,400
It's typical poltergeist.

Doctor, when they've got
those samples that we saw them
taking there,

1213
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,070
er, what do you do with them
when you get the sample?

1214
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,670
Well, we'll test it to see
if the calcium
and the magnesium salts

1215
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,830
match the hardness
of the local tap water.

1216
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:09,630
And where does it come from?

1217

Can I ask you now,
Dr Pascoe...

1227
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:46,000
We've had a look at
what's been happening there
in the house.

1228
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:48,270
What, in fact, do you make
of what we see?

1229
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,830
Well, poltergeist activity has
a pattern...

1230
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:53,170
A menu if you like, erm...

1231
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,270
First, there are the noises,
the sounds and then water.

1232
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:01,170
And then the third stage is
physical phenomenon,
moving objects.

1233
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,330
And did you think that in fact
what we're seeing there

1234
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,830
is something starting
to happen in Foxhill Drive?

1235
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:07,630
Well, who knows.

He's Kevin Trip, from Neath.

please, Doctor,

sitting here and stuff, er...

I'm telling you.

Well, you try us, Kevin.

1250
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,070
KEVIN: Well, my mates were
round to watch the videos

1251
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,730
and we put on the programmes
about ten minutes ago.

1252
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,770
Erm, I had this sandwich,

1253

it was.

1254
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:46,770
-Oh, yes.
-KEVIN: And it frightened me
to buggery, it did.

1255
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,330
I was minding my own business
and this dirty grey plate
sitting on the arm of my chair

-just dived off.
-MICHAEL: Sure, Kevin.

1257

None of us nowhere near it
or nothing, mind.

of its bloody own, it did.

Kevin, erm... How close
were you to the plate?

1260

Yes, yes. All right, Kevin,
I think I get the picture,
certainly.

Thank you very much,
indeed for calling.

have been prepared for that.

sceptical as I am,

00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,630
-(SCREAMING)
-SARAH: Kimmy!

1333
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,900
Come on.

1334
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,800
Kimmy.

1335
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:28,130
Suzanne, are you okay?

1336
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:29,730
Are you all right? Come on.

1337
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:31,300
-It wasn't me.
-It doesn't matter.

1338
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:33,300
-It wasn't me!
-It doesn't matter!

1339
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:42,030
MICHAEL: Oh, that's,
that's quite extraordinary.

1340
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,370
We set out to catch
a ghost and...

1341
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,830
And sadly, very sadly, what we
witnessed was a remarkable

1342
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,330
exposure of a hoax.

1343
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,630
Let's not be too hasty.

1344
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:52,670
Oh, come on, Doctor.
Please,

1345
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,970
-we've surely got to accept
we saw it there.
-DR PASCOE: No, I don't.

1346
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,030
Look, this is an
established pan.

1347
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,100
Genuine phenomena
followed by the fakery stage

1348
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:00,130
when the children feel obliged
to come up with the goods.

1349
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:01,400
Doctor, really?

1350
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:03,770
I'm sorry, because...

1351
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,800
Well, I mean, after
eight months of commitment

1352
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,700
and connected work
like you've been through,

1353
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,830
I can understand you feel
upset because you've
been duped.

1354
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,300
I'd be the first to admit it
if it was absolutely sure
I had been duped.

1355
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:13,630
Oh, Doctor, really...

1356
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:14,830
Please don't be simplistic.

1357
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,400
This is one incident
amongst many.

1358
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:17,800
Many dozens.

1359
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:19,300
I was there. I've seen them.

1360
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:21,300
I've seen inexplicable things.

1361
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:23,670
One-hundred percent,
no question.

1362
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:24,700
And this?

1363
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,330
Let's not get sidetracked,
please.

1364
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:30,730
Let... Let's not lose
the scent.

1365
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:34,970
Maybe there's a kind of...

1366
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,300
Ritualistic reason,
it's like sympathetic magic.

1367
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,770
Acting out what they want
to happen.

1368
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,970
The invoking process

1369
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,800
that proceeds
the genuine appearance.

1370
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:45,070
Doctor, before we get
too involved in that
kind of jargon,

1371
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,400
let's see what Suzanne has
to say about this.

1372
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,230
She might... Sarah, is Suzanne
able to speak to us?

1373
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:52,170
Suzanne needs a glass of water
right now.

1374
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,930
DR PASCOE: Can I talk to her?

1375
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:56,630
MICHAEL: Well, I think
I'd like to talk to her
first of all

1376
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:57,670
if you don't mind.

1377
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,000
Where's my mum?

1378
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:00,630
MICHAEL: Suzanne,
I'd like to talk to you.

1379
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:03,300
Did you put the writing
in your schoolbook?

1380
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:05,330
SUZANNE: (TEARFULLY)
I don't want to talk about it.

1381
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:07,630
MICHAEL: What about the noises
in the wall?

1382
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,630
SUZANNE: I don't want to talk
about it!

1383
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:12,100
MICHAEL:
What about the scratches
on your face, Suzanne?

1384
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,330
-(SOBS) Mum.
-It's all right, child.
Your mum's here.

1385
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:18,000
Doesn't matter.
Can you look at me?

1386
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,130
DR PASCOE: Why, Suzie?
You can tell me.

1387
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,100
SUZANNE: To show them.

1388
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:24,670
DR PASCOE: Well, you didn't
have to show them.
Not like this.

1389
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,630
Hmm? Why?

1390
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,770
Tell them
you don't tell lies, Suzie.

1391
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:36,100
It's all a mistake.

1392
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:37,830
She doesn't know what...
She doesn't know anything.

1393
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:38,930
Do you, love?

1394
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,770
I thought you'd leave us.

1395
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,000
DR PASCOE:
You thought I'd leave you?

1396
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:44,630
All we were,
were noises to you.

1397
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,300
DR PASCOE: And you lied
to make us stay?

1398
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:47,630
Sometimes.

1399
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,000
MICHAEL: Only sometimes?

1400
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,830
It was what you wanted,
wasn't it?

1401
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:53,100
We just gave you
what you wanted!

1402
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,270
KIM: Stop it!

1403
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,800
MICHAEL: Mrs Early,
you've heard your daughter.

1404
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:00,330
She's admitted the entire
thing was a deliberate fraud.

1405
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,900
No, I'm sorry,
I don't accept that.

1406
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:05,900
Dr Pascoe has seen in her
things, same as me.

1407
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:07,970
-You can't just...
-MICHAEL: But...

1408
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,300
Well, she's afraid,
she's frightened.

1409
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:13,770
-She doesn't know anything.
-MICHAEL: But, Suzanne herself
explained, Mrs Early.

1410
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,830
My family are telling
the truth.

1411
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,330
We're all telling the truth.

1412
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,630
Well, fortunately,
after this turn of events,

1413
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:35,330
we're able to return
to Dr Emilio Sylvestri.

1414
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:38,800
Dr Sylvestri, who's in
New York, joins us again now.

1415
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:41,730
Dr Sylvestri, I imagine
you're about to say,

1416
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:42,870
"I told you so."

1417
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:45,300
Well... (CHUCKLES)

1418
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:47,300
I... I don't get any
vicarious thrill

1419
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,630
out of seeing parapsychology
crucified in public.

1420
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,270
But it does...

1421
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,770
Validate my hypothesis.

1422
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,130
Hmm, what hypothesis?

1423
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:57,170
These are disturbed
attention-seekers...

1424
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,770
Oh, rubbish.

1425
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,170
We... (SNICKERS).
You played into their hands.

1426
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,230
Primetime TV
Alice in Wonderland,  couldn't
take it any more, they...

1427
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:07,600
-End of illusion...
-This is not the end,
please believe me.

1428
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:11,670
I almost... I almost feel,
whatever is in there, it's

1429
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,870
deliberately muddying
the waters.

1430
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:17,100
Well, Dr Pascoe, thank you.
And Dr Sylvestri,
thank you, too, for joining us

1431
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:19,870
from New York. Thank you
and... And good night to you.

1432
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,000
A lot of activity
in our phone room.

1433
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:25,930
You won't be amazed to
hear that after what we've
just seen in Foxhill Drive.

1434
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:28,400
Er, Mike Smith, what's
happening? What's the story?

1435
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:30,730
(HESITATINGLY) Well,
the strange thing is

1436
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:34,100
that we're still getting calls
about that shadowy figure,

1437
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,930
that was seen
in the haunted bedroom

1438
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:38,030
or people think they've
seen in the haunted bedroom.
Now...

1439
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:40,930
What's really weird is that
these are all tallying
with the description.

1440
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,730
These are all
different phone calls.

1441
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:44,870
They're, generally, all saying
that it's an old man

1442
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,070
or a woman.

1443
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,930
Er, bald with
a skull-like head,

1444
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:50,200
dark eyes,

1445
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,800
or some are just saying,
"Holes for eyes."

1446
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:57,030
Wearing a black robe
or a dress which is
buttoned up to the neck.

1447
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,870
So, if anybody's seen this
gentleman tonight...

1448
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,930
Michael, I'm sorry
to interrupt,
but this is important.

1449
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:04,870
Er, can somebody
in the gallery,
tell me if it's possible

1450
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,630
to access the tape interviews
I've shot at the university,
please.

1451
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:09,730
I'm sure, I'm sure
it will be, yes, erm...

1452
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:11,870
In view of what's happened
there's a sequence
I need to find, urgently.

1453
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,970
Yeah, they're saying
they can... They can get to it

1454
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,030
sometime further
on the programme.

1455
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:17,970
Yes, okay.
We can do that for you.

1456
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,630
Erm, in the meantime
we'll have another
Ghostwatch  story.

1457
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:24,730
And then after that, I'd like
to hear your opinion

1458
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:28,100
on what we saw,
a moment ago,
in Foxhill Drive.

1459
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:30,000
Is all of this,
all of this, a hoax

1460
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:32,200
or as Dr Pascoe believes,

1461
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:35,400
are things just about
beginning to happen?

1462
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:39,400
Well, call me after this true
ghost story, coming up now.

1463
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:41,000
When I was about
eleven or twelve,

1464
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,200
we moved to this large,
old Devonshire house.

1465
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:48,130
And part of the house is
a lot older than the other
part of the house.

1466
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,330
And it had a nasty feeling.

1467
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:51,730
It was cold.

1468
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:53,670
Erm, things...

1469
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:58,630
Doors opened,
things fell off the wall,
ornaments shattered,

1470
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:00,800
and generally, it didn't have
a nice feeling.

1471
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:03,170
Erm, my bedroom
was in part of that house.

1472
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,300
Part of that, old part of the
house. And, er...

1473
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:10,230
Shadows would move
at the end of my bed.

1474
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:12,370
So, I asked for a night light.

1475
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,870
I asked a grown-up,
I think it was my grandmother.

1476
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:18,100
Erm... Which made
the situation worse
in a way, because...

1477
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,700
(AUDIO SLOWING DOWN)

1478
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,270
-(TAPE REWINDING)
-...in a way.

1479
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,230
Wait, wait. Can we
just clear the set? (SNICKERS)

1480
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:29,370
Yeah, well something's
gone very wrong
with that ghost story,

1481
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,270
probably a poltergeist.
What do you think, Dr Pascoe?

1482
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,730
Anyway, erm, we'll try
to get back to that, er...

1483
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:39,330
Before the end
of the programme.
Er, meanwhile, what do we do?

1484
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:41,670
We go back to your calls,
that's what we'll do.

1485
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,270
Erm, Mike Smith?

1486
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,730
(HESITATING) Erm, the only one
I got for you at the moment,

1487
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:47,970
is this woman, try... Try her.

1488
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,070
She wants to remain anonymous.

1489
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,700
Wants to take part in
the programme, but insists
on anonymity. Try her.

1490
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:54,270
Okay, Mike, thanks.
Doctor, pick the phone up.

1491
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,630
-Hello?
-WOMAN: (ON PHONE) Hello.

1492
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:59,100
-Yes.
-WOMAN: Hello, am I on?

1493
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:02,870
Yes, You're, er... You're on
BBC One's Ghostwatch.

1494
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,230
Now, what do you want
to tell me about?

1495
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:09,070
WOMAN: (SIGHS) We've got this
big glass table.

1496
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:13,330
My husband just rested one
finger on it and it exploded.

1497
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:15,130
Glass everywhere,

1498
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:17,630
his face and hands were cut.

1499
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:19,130
There's blood
on the wallpaper.

1500
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:22,770
The ambulance is just gone.

1501
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,270
My children are frightened.
Why are you doing this?

1502
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,630
Now look, I am sure your
children are in shock. Er...

1503
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:31,330
Also want to say, I think,
it's high time, probably,

1504
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:32,930
that your kids are in bed.

1505
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:34,930
I mean, it is past
the 9:00 watershed, isn't it?

1506
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:37,030
WOMAN: That's it.
That's just it.

1507
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:38,630
They won't go to bed.

1508
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:41,100
I can't drag them
away from the TV.

1509
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:42,700
I tell them to look
at what time it is

1510
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:45,270
but the clock
still shows 9:30.

1511
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,970
Excuse me, have all
your clocks stopped?

1512
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,370
WOMAN: I don't know
what's going on.

1513
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,830
They won't take their eyes,
off the set.

1514
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,070
(CRYING) And there's blood...

1515
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,170
There's blood
all over the wallpaper.

1516
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,230
Look, love, it's Halloween.
They're overexcited.

1517
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:01,870
Er, you've had
a terrible accident. Now...

1518
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:06,700
Now, please, would you switch
off the TV and please,
send your kids to bed.

1519
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:08,900
Thanks for calling us,
but we've got to move on.
Thank you, love.

1520
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:10,370
No, don't let her...

1521
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,000
I'm sorry, she's gone.

1522
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:14,730
Erm, listen, please...

1523
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:16,630
If you're still there.

1524
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:19,730
Don't touch anything,
and if you can,
take a photograph.

1525
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,800
Now, this is very
valuable evidence.

1526
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,800
I've got to say to everyone
watching.

1527
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:27,670
Please, please, we don't want
to give anybody
sleepless nights.

Don't let your imaginations
run riot.

These things we're talking
about are very,
very rare, indeed.

1531

happening to you are
exceedingly remote.

Dr Pascoe, that
that tape you wanted,

1534
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:47,170
that interview you did some
months ago with Kim Early,

1535
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,330
I think that's ready now.
I think we can go to it.

1536
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:51,170
It's coming up now.
There you are.

1537
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,630
So, have ever
seen him then, Kimmy?

1538
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:56,000
Pipes? Yeah.

1539
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:58,270
And what does he look like?
Can you describe him
to me, then?

1540
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:02,000
Well, he's really old.

1541
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:08,200
And this eye's got all blood
over his eye and scratch
coming out and then...

1542
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:10,630
-He's bald over his head.
-Mmm-hmm.

1543
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:12,300
And then he's got a nose.

1544
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:15,630
And in the middle, it's got
a scratch all the way down.

1545
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:18,100
-Hmm.
-In there.

1546
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,270
-And he's got a dress on.
A dress on.
-Does he?

1547
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:23,630
Yeah. It's really long
and it's black.

1548
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,370
-It's got buttons,
all the way down.
-Hmm.

1549
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,000
-And then lots of petticoats
underneath.
-DR PASCOE: Can we replay it?

1550
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:31,800
-MICHAEL: Sure, sure we can.
-DR PASCOE: Back to the start
of the description.

1551
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:34,100
All right,
can we roll it back, BTL?

1552

-Mmm-hmm.

exactly matches

on the phones.

-Buttoned.

01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:06,930
Well, could they have read
the descriptions in
a newspaper, perhaps?

1565
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:09,830
There's been nothing in the
newspapers, not containing
that description.

1566
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:12,770

one single time, I assure you.

Well, we were drawn to
assuming it was Suzanne
at the centre of this

1569
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,670
because she's at puberty,
but what if she isn't?
What if it's Kim?

01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,170
Doctor.

1652
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,400
Er, hello,
who am I talking to?

1653
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:00,830
WOMAN: (ON PHONE) Oh, hello,
my name is Mary Christopher.

1654
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:03,770
And I just wanted to phone
and tell you about this...

1655
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,400
Well...
About my mother, really.

1656
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:08,970
We were Northolt
born and bred.

1657
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,800
And, erm, and as children,
if we were naughty
or couldn't get to sleep,

1658
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:16,630
our mum used to say, "Mother
Seddons will come to get you."

1659
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,130
It used to scare us rigid.

1660
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:20,900
I don't know why she'd...

1661
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:22,930
Parents do do some awful and
daft things, don't they, Mary?

1662
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:24,270
MARY: Yeah, well, years later,

1663
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,400
I found out that
she really did exist.

1664
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:29,170
And she was a baby farmer,
like a child minder.

1665
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,830
She used to take kids in,
but she used to kill them.

1666
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:34,830
And she'd drown them
in the big coppers.

1667
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:37,000
And why... Why I'm ringing is,

1668
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:38,830
she used to live
in one of the old terraces

1669
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:41,300
in Foxhill by the railway
as it was then,

1670
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:43,070
and is now, Foxhill Drive,

1671
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:47,670
and I'm just sure it's where
those poor girls live now.

1672
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:48,970
And really,
that's all I have to say.

1673
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,630
I just wanted
to make sure you knew.

1674
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:51,700
Thanks for your call, Mary.

1675
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:53,700
Thanks very much
for calling in.

1676
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:55,000
Sarah, I wonder...

1677
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:57,270
Sarah, Sarah,
did you hear any of that?

1678
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,330
Sarah, can you hear me?

1679
01:10:58,370 --> 01:10:59,930
Could I talk to Sarah, please?

1680
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:02,630
Mike, it's all right.
I can hear you. I'm fine.

1681
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:05,170
Erm, Suzanne's feeling
a bit better now.

1682
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,400
But we still don't know how
the scratches got on her face.

1683
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,930
But, we feel it's probably
best to get the girls
out of the house now.

1684
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,100
Er, things are still...

1685
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,400
Feeling quite strange.

1686
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:17,030
KIM: No, we're not!
Get it off!

1687
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:19,100
I've got to talk to somebody.

1688
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:22,370
Kimmy? Who?

1689
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:26,630
Kim, who're you talking to?

1690
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,100
Pipes.

1691
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:31,700
SARAH: Where's Pipes?

1692
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:33,770
Here.

1693
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:36,370
SARAH: What does he look like,
Kimmy?

1694
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,900
Like somebody's mum.

1695
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:41,130
MICHAEL: I'd like both
of those children
out of that house.

1696

it's time to go.
-No!

1697
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:44,630
MICHAEL: I'd like somebody to
take care of Suzanne as well.

1698
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,670
Please, let's have
the kids out of the house.

1699
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:47,730
-I want to speak to Pipes.
-Leave me alone.

1700

I'm not a baby!

1701

KIM: No, you lied,
you said you'd stay.

1702
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,270

KIM: I don't want to go.

1709
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:06,630
Pipes says we've got to stay.

1710
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:08,370
Pipes wants to see everybody.

1711
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,770
Look, everybody wants
to see him.

1712
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,230
MICHAEL: Hopefully,
the children are on their way
out of the house now.

1713
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:17,630
And once they are,
I suppose that'll be the end

1714
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:20,900
of our program, the end of our
Ghostwatch programme.

1715
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:23,130
I hope they...
They are out shortly.

1716
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:25,700
Er, as we wait for them
to come out,

1717
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:28,170
we'll go over
to our phone-in studio.

1718
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,970
Mike, what's been happening?

1719
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,270
MIKE: Er, well,
it's understandably
fairly chaotic here.

1720
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,270
Erm, we're getting all sorts
of calls.

1721
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:39,070
In Derby, someone was ringing
to say that her clock
had stopped.

1722
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,770
MICHAEL: Again,
a clock stopping.

1723
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,930
A Ken and Joyce Shrivener
from Telford in Shropshire,

1724
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:45,030
their radio has gone dead.

1725
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:47,730
And the microwave oven
is pinging repetitively.

1726
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,030
Well, where are
they happening?

1727
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,900
I mean, is there
a geographical pattern?

1728
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:53,070
How many of these incidents
are there?

1729
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,030
I don't know, I don't know
how many of these to take
with a pinch of salt.

1730
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:58,800
Mrs Pinder from Chepstow,
her dog won't stop barking.

1731
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:01,730
Er, in fact, we have
loads of instances
recorded here, this evening,

1732
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:03,400
of pets acting up
all through the programme.

1733
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:05,300
Mr Naro from Cheltenham,

1734
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:07,400
says his son
is making glasses break.

1735
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:11,630
I'm sure we can assume
that many, if not all of
these calls, are jokes.

1736
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:13,900
I'm more interested in
what's happening at the house.

1737
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:15,070
Are they all out yet?

1738
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,070
MIKE: No, no,
wait, wait, wait.

1739
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,870
We've got one here that,
erm...

1740
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,630
Just in the last few minutes,
a young lady, very distressed,

1741
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,730
in response to something
that we showed earlier on.

1742
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:26,930
And she's hung up
before we'd had a chance to
talk to her, so...

1743
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:29,030
The point is,
there's someone here
who could take your call now.

1744
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:30,800
We need to talk to you,
could you call back?

1745
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:32,930
- Can we talk to these people?
-Let's get back to Sarah.

They won't listen to me.

1755
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:55,330
I think Suzanne's in...

1756
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:57,370
In some kind
of a state of shock.

Well, what do you know
about it?

1888

Well, we've been into
all that. We've got the, er,

1889
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,170
the deeds and searches going
back to the year it was built.

1890

And the history of the site
as far the Doomsday Book,

1891

They lived there in the '60s
I think.

they sublet a room?

1896
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:11,870
No, I didn't...
I didn't know that.

1897

MAN: Being illegal,
it wouldn't be on
the official records.

1898
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:17,900
The lodger was their nephew,
Raymond Tunstall.

1899
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:20,630
How do you know him?
And why are you calling, sir?

1900

MAN: I worked
as his social worker

1901
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,830
when he came out of
psychiatric hospital.

1902
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:27,670
He had several convictions
for molestation,

1903
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:30,600
aggravated abuse,
abduction of minors...

1904
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:33,130
He should never have been let
anywhere near any community.

1905
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:36,230
He was a very disturbed man
in my opinion.

1906
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:37,870
MICHAEL: In what way?

1907
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,770
MAN: From the time he moved
to Foxhill Drive,

1908
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,270
he developed
paranoid fantasies.

1909
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,800
He used to tell me there was
a woman on the inside
of his body,

1910
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:48,100
taking over his thoughts
and actions,

1911
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:50,800
making him do things
he didn't want to do.

1912
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:53,200
He started to wear dresses.

1913
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:54,970
The delusions got so bad,

1914
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,700
there was only one way
to escape them.

1915
01:20:57,730 --> 01:20:59,700
He took his own life.

1916
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:01,100
That's why I called.

1917
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:02,970
When I heard...

1918
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,970
When I was sitting here
watching the TV and...

1919
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:11,100
Hello? Are you still there?

1920
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:13,130
If you are, please go on.
Hello?

1921
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:17,930
MAN: Tunstall hanged himself.

1922
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,770
He tied a wire around his neck

1923
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,070
to a lathe and switched it on.

1924
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:26,630
He did it where he kept
his tools, under the stairs.

1925
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:29,370
His aunt and uncle
were on holiday.

1926
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,770
It was twelve days
before anybody found him.

1927
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,370
They heard the cats screaming.

1928
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:37,330
He had about a dozen cats.

1929
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:39,800
The cats were locked in,
of course.

1930
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:42,000
Of course...

1931
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:45,130
Twelve days...
They got hungry.

1932
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:48,970
They got to work, on...

1933
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,630
On his face.
