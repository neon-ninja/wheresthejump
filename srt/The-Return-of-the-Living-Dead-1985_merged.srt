1
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:25,120
Hey, Frank! Let's wrap it up and go home.
What do you say?

2
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,736
I got another hour's work to do.
The kid'll stay, and I'll show him the ropes.

3
00:00:29,837 --> 00:00:31,868
Okay. Lock up for me before you go?

4
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:34,305
Fourth of July weekend, buddy boy.
Got to move.

5
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,675
Yeah. You have a nice Fourth,
and I'll see you Sunday at the barbecue.

6
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,340
You'd better believe it.
I'll be there with bells on.

7
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:44,577
Kid, I wanna tell you something,
and I mean this sincerely.

8
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:47,712
No matter what happens,
don't name it after me.

9
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,653
Take it easy, Frank.

10
00:00:52,827 --> 00:00:54,523
That Burt's a joker.

11
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,292
- Freddy, follow me and learn something.
- Okay.

12
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,664
We got an order here from
the St. Louis University Medical School.

13
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,864
They want two adult female skeletons
with perfect teeth.

14
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:06,168
That's a 2-AF-PT.

15
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:10,803
So you come over here to the "A" section.
That's "A" for adult, see?

16
00:01:10,913 --> 00:01:13,074
Then that's divided up into two sections.

17
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:16,016
That's divided into the "M" for male
and the "F" for...

18
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,179
- Female.
- Good boy. Now the "PT."

19
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:22,224
Suppose you think that's "pretty tough."
But no, that's...

20
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:24,555
- Perfect teeth.
- Very good.

21
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:27,892
Now you get some excelsior over there
and lay it in that crate.

22
00:01:27,998 --> 00:01:31,161
Make a nice little beddy-bye
for this little lady.

23
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:32,993
Okay.

24
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:36,430
Good work. We want her to be comfortable.

25
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,532
Now help me get her in. Grab her legs.

26
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:40,142
Okay.

27
00:01:40,244 --> 00:01:45,113
Now you get some of that
Styrofoam popcorn, spread it all around.

28
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:48,852
Don't be stingy.
Uncle Burt's paying for this.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,588
More, Freddy. Okay, that's fine.

30
00:01:52,056 --> 00:01:54,752
Now spread it around. That's right.

31
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,987
- You're doing very nice work.
- Thanks.

32
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:59,495
You'll be fine in the warehouse business.

33
00:01:59,598 --> 00:02:02,658
- Where do we get all these skeletons?
- They come from India.

34
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:04,395
- India?
- International treaty.

35
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:06,733
All skeletons come from India.

36
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:09,774
- No kidding. How come?
- How the hell do I know?

37
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:13,902
The important question is, where do they
get all the skeletons with perfect teeth?

38
00:02:14,012 --> 00:02:16,037
I'm going to ask you a serious question.

39
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:18,208
How many people you know die...

40
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,651
with a beautiful, perfect
set of choppers in their puss?

41
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:23,153
Nobody I can think of.

42
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:26,487
No. I think there's a skeleton farm
over in India.

43
00:02:27,827 --> 00:02:28,816
Jesus!

44
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:31,692
Come on, kid. Follow your uncle here.

45
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:35,859
Here we go. I don't have to tell you
what these are for.

46
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:41,369
Here we've got the prosthetic devices,
all around here.

47
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:45,468
- Look under there. Wheelchairs.
- Right. These are great.

48
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:49,015
Here's something you don't see very often.
You're a privileged person.

49
00:02:49,116 --> 00:02:52,643
These are split dogs
for veterinarian schools.

50
00:02:52,753 --> 00:02:56,416
- We get a lot of orders for split dogs.
- That's really rad.

51
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,621
Don't fool around, you're learning.

52
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:02,557
Over here, Freddy,
is where we keep the fresh cadavers.

53
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:07,426
We sell these to medical schools
and to the US Army for ballistic tests.

54
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:15,333
Say hello.

55
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:26,514
We usually got more inventory than this...

56
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:29,614
but we're expecting a shipment on Monday.

57
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,994
How many bodies are in here usually?

58
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:36,155
You don't want to be overstocked.

59
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:38,096
Like the restaurant business...

60
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,636
you don't want your inventory
to lose its freshness.

61
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:49,574
Tell you what I'll do, kid. Teach you
how to fill out these shipping forms.

62
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:52,148
Look alive.

63
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,889
- We gonna party tonight or what?
- We are gonna party.

64
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,788
- Where we gonna party?
- I don't know. Somewhere.

65
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:03,986
We can go to the park.

66
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:07,189
We can't. The cops will
shoot us if we go back to the park.

67
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:10,290
- I ain't in no mood to die tonight.
- I like death.

68
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:14,428
- I like death with sex. And you, Casey?
- Yeah, so fuck off and die.

69
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:16,029
When we gonna party tonight, Tina?

70
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,075
That'd be rad, but I have to meet Freddy
when he's done work.

71
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:22,408
- Where you supposed to meet him?
- At this medical supply warehouse.

72
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,744
No, he got a job? What a dick.

73
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,445
Shit, why didn't you say so?
Why don't we all go pick Freddy up?

74
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:30,920
He always knows
where there's a place to party.

75
00:04:40,632 --> 00:04:41,758
Frank?

76
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:43,298
Yeah, kid?

77
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:47,163
What's the weirdest thing
you ever saw in here?

78
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:53,570
I have seen weird things come,
and I have seen weird things go.

79
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,344
But the weirdest thing I ever saw
just had to cap it all.

80
00:04:58,618 --> 00:05:00,984
Yeah? What's that?

81
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:03,313
Let me ask you a question, kid.

82
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:08,661
Did you see that movie
Night of the Living Dead?

83
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:12,259
That's the one where the corpses
start eating the people, right?

84
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,231
Sure. What about it?

85
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:17,503
Did you know that movie
was based on a true case?

86
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:20,606
Come on, you're shitting me, right?

87
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:23,300
I've never been more serious in my life.

88
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:27,743
That's not possible. They showed
zombies taking over the world.

89
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:32,248
They changed it all around.
What really happened was...

90
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:36,547
back in 1969, in Pittsburgh,
at the VA hospital...

91
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:38,489
there was a chemical spill...

92
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:43,389
and all that stuff leaked down
into the morgue...

93
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:48,400
and it made all the dead bodies
jump around as though it was alive.

94
00:05:48,503 --> 00:05:52,497
- What chemical?
- 245-Trioxin, it's called.

95
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:56,069
It was to spray on marijuana or something.

96
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,475
And the Darrow Chemical Company
was trying to develop it for the army.

97
00:06:00,716 --> 00:06:04,049
And they told
the guy who made the movie...

98
00:06:04,253 --> 00:06:08,212
that if he told the true story,
they'd just sue his ass off.

99
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:11,556
So he changed all the facts around.

100
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,892
What really happened?

101
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:16,431
They closed it all down...

102
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:20,797
and the army shipped
all that contaminated dirt...

103
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:23,168
and all those dead bodies out.

104
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:26,136
And they kept it a secret.

105
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:31,138
How come you know about it?

106
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:34,241
A typical army fuck-up.

107
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:38,619
The transportation department got
the orders crossed...

108
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,656
and they shipped those bodies here...

109
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:46,320
instead of to the Darrow Chemical Company.

110
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:52,964
Hello?

111
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:57,037
Hi, honey.
No, I'll be home in about an hour.

112
00:06:57,143 --> 00:06:59,668
You keep the pot roast hot, okay?

113
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,646
Sure, I love you too, honey.
Yeah. Kiss, kiss.

114
00:07:10,022 --> 00:07:11,649
Wanna see them?

115
00:07:13,627 --> 00:07:16,391
- See them?
- The corpses.

116
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:20,255
What are you talking about?

117
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:23,061
- They're down in the basement.
- No.

118
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:26,599
- Come on.
- No way.

119
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:35,375
Mind the third step. It's a bitch.

120
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,182
They just brought the bodies here
and left them?

121
00:07:38,286 --> 00:07:39,947
You know the army.

122
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:44,548
- They've been here all this time?
- 14 years, as I recall.

123
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:47,417
No kidding?

124
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,357
There they are.

125
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:54,131
There's bodies in there?

126
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:15,018
Shit. Look at that.

127
00:08:15,624 --> 00:08:18,822
- You say that thing was alive?
- So they say.

128
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:26,060
Oh, God.

129
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:29,664
- Do these things leak?
- Hell, no.

130
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:33,003
These things were made
by the US Army Corps of Engineers.

131
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:21,751
- Hello, dear. How was your day?
- The usual, crap.

132
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:23,484
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:26,819
- What's for dinner?
- Your favorite, lamb chops.

134
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:28,688
I had them for lunch.

135
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:52,708
It's me checking in
from Station 3 at 1600...

136
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:55,014
make that 1601 hours.

137
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:57,282
I'll be home all evening. Right.

138
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:14,900
It's nerve-racking to live
around that equipment all the time.

139
00:12:15,008 --> 00:12:18,205
They have to be able to reach me
24 hours a day, wherever I am.

140
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:21,611
- You know that.
- All that microwave stuff affects my oven.

141
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:24,013
When we find them,
you can have it taken out.

142
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:28,019
- But when will you find them?
- Christ, Ethel, I don't know.

143
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,055
Maybe we'll never find them.

144
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:39,931
We've been through all this before.
They could be anywhere.

145
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:48,838
- Where the fuck are we going?
- To party.

146
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:50,032
To pick up Freddy.

147
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,171
- What the fuck is Freddy up to these days?
- He got a job.

148
00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:55,648
- No shit? What job?
- He's a stockroom clerk.

149
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,275
That sounds like a shitty job.

150
00:12:57,386 --> 00:13:00,822
It isn't the President of the US,
but he makes money to buy stuff.

151
00:13:00,923 --> 00:13:04,984
- Maybe he'll buy something from me.
- He don't like your kind of stuff, Suicide.

152
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:07,619
How come you guys only come by
when you need a ride?

153
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,721
'Cause you one spooky motherfucker.

154
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:13,530
You think I'm spooky?
What the fuck do you think you are?

155
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:29,178
- Man, what a hideous, ugly place.
- I like it. It's a statement.

156
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:31,277
- Come on, let's go get the prick.
- No.

157
00:13:31,388 --> 00:13:33,448
- Why not?
- It might freak out his boss.

158
00:13:33,558 --> 00:13:35,116
That's not nice.

159
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:38,091
What does he think we are,
weird or something?

160
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:40,356
- What time does Freddy get off?
- 10:00.

161
00:13:40,464 --> 00:13:44,025
- I ain't sittin' here two fuckin' hours.
- We could go drive around.

162
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:47,434
- I don't got gas. You wanna buy some?
- I was kidding.

163
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:51,304
- We could go fool around in there.
- You mean that cemetery?

164
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:53,634
Let's do that.

165
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:14,456
What do you want to do,
turn over gravestones?

166
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,728
No, I just want to look around
the graveyard.

167
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:18,599
I ain't never seen one before.

168
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:21,833
- You never been to a funeral?
- I never knew nobody that died.

169
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,875
I don't think this is a good idea.

170
00:14:23,977 --> 00:14:25,740
- What's that?
- Road flares, ass-wipe.

171
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:28,405
- What do you want with those?
- I just want to party.

172
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:30,675
What are the road flares for?

173
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:44,254
This place is a mess.

174
00:14:48,602 --> 00:14:51,765
- It looks like your pad, Scuz.
- I heard that.

175
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,346
Frank?

176
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:26,036
Are you okay, kid?

177
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:29,040
I don't know. I don't feel so good.

178
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:31,742
Christ, what a stink.

179
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:40,482
- What the hell happened to the body?
- It must have melted when it hit the air.

180
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,581
Close the goddamn thing.

181
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,801
Christ, I never smelled anything
like that before.

182
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:01,035
I think I'm gonna be sick.

183
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:24,292
I don't guess
we'd better tell Burt about this.

184
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:28,305
- It makes us look stupid or something.
- I can still smell that stuff.

185
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:30,739
It must be in my nose
or all over everything.

186
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:34,006
I'd better spray some deodorant
around here.

187
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:50,558
What was that?

188
00:16:51,998 --> 00:16:53,363
Sounds like a dog.

189
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:54,899
A dog?

190
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:59,431
Wait a second. Listen. You hear that?

191
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:02,101
What the hell's going on here?

192
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:16,814
What's wrong with him?

193
00:17:19,894 --> 00:17:20,918
Shit!

194
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:25,590
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna kill it!

195
00:17:29,304 --> 00:17:31,465
What are you doing? Stop!

196
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:38,943
Jesus!

197
00:17:41,883 --> 00:17:45,911
- Are we fucked? What's happening?
- The cadaver.

198
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:49,715
- What's it doing in there?
- I don't know. It sounds sore.

199
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:53,227
- What are we going to do?
- Lock it in.

200
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:58,166
Hurry! Jesus Christ!

201
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:01,264
We gotta think.

202
00:18:01,737 --> 00:18:03,671
Come on, son, get in there!

203
00:18:04,507 --> 00:18:05,906
Jesus Christ!

204
00:18:06,677 --> 00:18:10,044
- Are we going crazy?
- No, it's that crap from the tanks.

205
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:12,843
The goddamn chemicals,
it's all over everything.

206
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,249
- Stupid asshole!
- Watch your tongue if you like this job.

207
00:18:16,353 --> 00:18:18,753
- Like this job?
- Think!

208
00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:21,823
- We got to tell the cops.
- No, you don't want to call them.

209
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:23,620
You know what they'd do to the company?

210
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,321
- Who cares about the company?
- Our reputation!

211
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,365
- Fuck your reputation.
- Think!

212
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,994
What about the number on the tank?

213
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:35,198
- It said, "Call in case of an emergency."
- No, that's the army.

214
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:39,037
You don't want the goddamn
army around this place. Think!

215
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:41,611
- What are we gonna do?
- What are we gonna do?

216
00:18:41,713 --> 00:18:43,772
We're gonna call the boss.

217
00:18:56,962 --> 00:18:58,759
Burt? Frank.

218
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:01,655
We have a little problem.

219
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:05,463
Do you ever fantasize...

220
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:08,535
about being killed?

221
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:10,002
Never.

222
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:15,240
Do you ever wonder about
all the different ways of dying...

223
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:17,544
you know, violently...

224
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:22,987
and wonder what
would be the most horrible way to die?

225
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:26,017
I try not to think about dying too much.

226
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:29,922
For me...

227
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:32,593
the worst way...

228
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,331
would be for a bunch of old men...

229
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:38,702
to get around me...

230
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,274
and start biting...

231
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:43,873
and eating me alive.

232
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:45,137
I see.

233
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,213
First...

234
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:50,512
they would tear off my clothes.

235
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:55,380
Let's get some light over here.
Trash is taking off her clothes again.

236
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:18,146
Throw it, baby.

237
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:20,179
Are you high on anything?

238
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:39,926
You opened it? You stupid moron.
What's the matter with you?

239
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:44,235
Haven't I always told you never
even to go near those goddamn tanks?

240
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:47,800
- What are we gonna do?
- Tell you what I'm gonna do.

241
00:20:47,911 --> 00:20:51,574
I'm gonna be sued by the company,
investigated by the government.

242
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:53,843
I might become famous,
might lose my business.

243
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:57,080
I might even go to jail, goddamn it.
That's what I'm gonna do.

244
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:07,687
On the other hand, we destroy all the
evidence and we keep our mouths shut.

245
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,427
That's it! Let's do that.

246
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:13,903
That's what we got to do.

247
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,298
One question.

248
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:20,143
This guy screaming in here,
you're sure he's a dead cadaver?

249
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:25,047
- Why don't you open the door and find out?
- I'm sorry. I'll take your word for that.

250
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:28,951
If it is a reanimated body,
we'll have to kill it.

251
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:33,223
- How do you kill something that's dead?
- How do I know?

252
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,726
- I don't know, let me think.
- It's not a bad question.

253
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:40,360
In that movie, they destroyed
the brain to kill them. Right?

254
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,196
The brain, right.

255
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:47,030
- What do doctors use to crack skulls with?
- Surgical drills.

256
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,368
Here, hold this.

257
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,603
Now listen to me very carefully.
Freddy, you'll open that door.

258
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:54,441
Come here, stand right over here.
Frank, right here.

259
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:56,778
When it comes out, brain it with the axe.

260
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:57,907
Jesus!

261
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:01,819
How am I gonna stop it from moaning?
What's the matter with you?

262
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:04,483
Come here. Get down there.
Stand by the door.

263
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:08,551
- It's gonna be all right, son.
- I don't think I can do this.

264
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:10,824
You damn well better.
You got us into this.

265
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,896
Jesus!

266
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,759
All right, Freddy. 22, right.

267
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,010
Be brave, Frank, goddamn it!

268
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:25,245
4, left.

269
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,508
10, right.

270
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:45,662
Get him off!

271
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:02,151
Coming.

272
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:03,719
Hold it!

273
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:13,427
- What the hell's going on, Burt?
- The brain!

274
00:23:13,998 --> 00:23:15,522
I hit the fucking brain!

275
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:19,160
Then do something else,
for goddamn-it-to-hell's sake.

276
00:23:19,603 --> 00:23:21,332
Hold him down.

277
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:25,170
I can't stand this any longer.

278
00:23:25,944 --> 00:23:28,003
- Shit!
- Hold him down now!

279
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:30,081
What are you gonna do?

280
00:23:33,718 --> 00:23:37,882
- Be a man!
- I can't stand this, you son of a bitch.

281
00:23:38,356 --> 00:23:40,051
Hurry up!

282
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:03,138
I'll get him.

283
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:05,844
I got him. Get a rope!

284
00:24:05,953 --> 00:24:09,912
- Where the fuck's a rope?
- I don't know. Get one. Hold him down!

285
00:24:10,524 --> 00:24:13,925
- Hang on to the son of a bitch!
- Christ, it ain't dying.

286
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:17,229
I thought you said
if we destroyed the brain, it'd die!

287
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,925
- It worked in the movie.
- It ain't working now.

288
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:23,161
- You mean the movie lied?
- Jesus.

289
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:32,843
- How are we gonna kill it?
- Maybe you can't. Maybe it won't die.

290
00:24:36,384 --> 00:24:39,512
We just got to destroy it completely
until there's nothing left.

291
00:24:39,654 --> 00:24:40,712
Acid.

292
00:24:41,155 --> 00:24:44,955
- What kind of acid would dissolve a body?
- Sulfuric acid, maybe.

293
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:48,257
No, aqua regia, that's stronger.

294
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:52,027
But what if it doesn't dissolve everything,
like the bones?

295
00:24:52,835 --> 00:24:53,802
Shit!

296
00:24:55,504 --> 00:24:57,438
What are we gonna do?

297
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:01,905
Where are you going?

298
00:25:05,114 --> 00:25:07,605
Sometimes Ernie Kaltenbrunner
works late on Fridays.

299
00:25:07,717 --> 00:25:09,685
Who's Ernie Kaltenbrunner?

300
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:12,516
He's the embalmer
at the mortuary across the street.

301
00:25:12,622 --> 00:25:16,388
- What the hell's he gonna do for us?
- His light's on. He's in.

302
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:21,424
Ernie's got a crematorium
across the street.

303
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:24,125
A crematorium, that's beautiful.

304
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:28,534
- Think you can get him to go along with it?
- I don't know. I've known him for 25 years.

305
00:25:28,638 --> 00:25:30,470
He might do it out of friendship.

306
00:25:30,574 --> 00:25:35,034
What the hell are you gonna tell him?
I mean, can you trust that bastard?

307
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:37,878
I don't think we have a choice.

308
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:41,247
How we gonna get this thing over there?

309
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:49,449
Give me the bone saw.

310
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:56,563
Why don't you put your clothes on?
The show's over.

311
00:25:56,668 --> 00:25:59,660
What's the matter?
Does it make you nervous?

312
00:26:00,906 --> 00:26:02,305
I'm hot.

313
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:06,500
- You are hot.
- Scram, wimp.

314
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:15,351
Nobody understands me, you know that?

315
00:26:15,455 --> 00:26:18,481
I fuckin' bust my ass for you guys,
and what do I get?

316
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:20,286
"You're spooky."

317
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,921
Fuck you, man. Fuck you all.

318
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:24,690
I like it spooky.

319
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:29,294
I got somethin' to say, you know?
What do you think this is all about?

320
00:26:29,402 --> 00:26:33,169
You think this is a fuckin' costume?
This is a way of life!

321
00:26:33,574 --> 00:26:34,700
Yes.

322
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:41,477
What's wrong with you, man?
Show some fucking respect for the dead.

323
00:26:45,552 --> 00:26:46,849
Is that Freddy?

324
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:49,286
- Where?
- Over there, going into that building.

325
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,620
Nope. That is not Freddy.

326
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:56,126
- How would you know?
- Why would he be going into a mortuary?

327
00:27:48,485 --> 00:27:50,350
What do you say, Ernie?

328
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,126
- Take it easy.
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.

329
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,629
Fast on the draw.

330
00:28:07,371 --> 00:28:11,671
- You are working late tonight.
- Pretty much. Kind of...

331
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:15,068
What time is it? You want a cup of coffee?

332
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,638
- No, thank you. I'm all right.
- I do, and I need it.

333
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:24,719
What are you doing there?

334
00:28:25,691 --> 00:28:27,625
Breaking out the rigor mortis.

335
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,986
Yeah?

336
00:28:30,262 --> 00:28:31,559
Come here.

337
00:28:33,198 --> 00:28:37,134
Come on.
You see, rigor mortis starts in the brain.

338
00:28:37,236 --> 00:28:42,038
And it spreads down to the internal organs,
and it finally settles in the muscles.

339
00:28:44,711 --> 00:28:48,010
It loosens up after a while...

340
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:52,750
but you can break it out manually,
as they say...

341
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:54,748
by flexing the muscles.

342
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:56,579
- See that?
- Yeah.

343
00:28:56,856 --> 00:28:59,086
You'll not find that in a book, my friend.

344
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:03,061
The embalming business is basically
passed on by word of mouth.

345
00:29:03,163 --> 00:29:06,758
I'll tell you, that's fascinating,
that's really something.

346
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,233
He's dead now. And I am bushed.

347
00:29:17,111 --> 00:29:18,840
Buddy boy.

348
00:29:20,114 --> 00:29:23,084
How long we been friends? About how long?

349
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:26,746
Twenty-five years, give or take.

350
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:31,482
If I ask you a favor,
could you keep it quiet?

351
00:29:31,593 --> 00:29:33,185
Sure. What is it?

352
00:29:33,428 --> 00:29:37,592
I'm gonna need some help
in a pretty big way, really.

353
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:40,900
You can depend on me. Why? What's wrong?

354
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:44,632
I got a couple of my men out here,
you mind if I let them in?

355
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,833
No, that's illegal.

356
00:29:46,943 --> 00:29:49,036
You can bring it on in now, please.

357
00:29:49,145 --> 00:29:52,740
You can put it right over here.
Right here.

358
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:57,250
What is that?

359
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,118
- Right there, please.
- Here?

360
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:13,499
I got to...

361
00:30:17,874 --> 00:30:20,104
What the hell's in those bags?

362
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,912
Rabid weasels.

363
00:30:23,013 --> 00:30:25,915
What the hell are you doing
with a bunch of rabid weasels?

364
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:28,611
I was trying to explain it.
They came as a shipment.

365
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,588
They weren't supposed to be rabid,
but you know how these things happen.

366
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,123
I don't. How do they happen?

367
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:36,625
Watch out, don't get bit.

368
00:30:37,261 --> 00:30:39,354
Anyway, we got them,
and we need your help.

369
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:42,661
- How?
- We got to get rid of these things.

370
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:45,202
Why don't you call an animal shelter?

371
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:49,035
Word'd get out, hurt my business.
You know, that's a bad scene, rabies.

372
00:30:49,274 --> 00:30:50,571
I don't think so.

373
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:53,474
I mean, so what?
You don't run a pet store.

374
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:58,414
Some lab animals got rabies.
Come on, take them to the pound.

375
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:03,317
I just can't do that.
You got to take my word for it.

376
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:08,594
- What the hell do you want me to do?
- You have a crematorium, right?

377
00:31:08,695 --> 00:31:11,186
- You wanna burn them?
- That's what I had in mind.

378
00:31:11,765 --> 00:31:14,791
- That's cruel.
- I can't think of anything else to do.

379
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:19,531
You just can't burn animals alive.
It's just too hideous.

380
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:21,606
At least let me kill them first.

381
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:24,939
Take them out in the parking lot,
and put 'em out of their misery.

382
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:28,571
I don't think that'd work.

383
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:32,379
I don't understand what's going on.
Why not?

384
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:42,618
- Can you swear to keep a secret?
- At this point, I don't know.

385
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,359
No, you got to swear.
You got to, or I just can't tell you.

386
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:50,370
- All right, I swear.
- Good.

387
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:57,341
It's not weasels in the bags.

388
00:31:59,014 --> 00:32:00,914
No kidding. Look here.

389
00:32:12,161 --> 00:32:13,628
Get it off!

390
00:32:25,975 --> 00:32:27,567
I'm sorry.

391
00:32:27,677 --> 00:32:30,077
No, it's all right.

392
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:38,645
We got a...

393
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,353
We got a long story to tell you.

394
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:45,925
Great. Some party.
What happened to Trash and Suicide?

395
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:48,728
Probably getting it on somewhere.

396
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:52,327
Don't even think it, Chuck.

397
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,404
God, when's 10:00 gonna come?

398
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:58,766
If you wanna split,
we could both go somewhere.

399
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,973
You'd really like to do it with me,
wouldn't you?

400
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:09,152
- I mean, a girl like you and a guy like me.
- Go choke a chicken.

401
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,286
Come on, Casey. I was only kidding.

402
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:16,656
- Great, here's your friend and mine.
- Fuck you, ball buster.

403
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:21,299
My watch stopped. What time is it?

404
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:28,901
Going on 10:00.

405
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:33,170
Fudge. I'd better get over and find Freddy.
He's gonna be getting off any time.

406
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,713
Go ahead, we'll wait for you.

407
00:33:34,815 --> 00:33:36,976
- Don't go anywhere, okay?
- All right.

408
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:39,681
Come on, Freddy, where are you?

409
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:44,279
Frankly, I think you acted
precipitously in cutting up the corpse.

410
00:34:44,387 --> 00:34:47,049
You may be right,
I don't know, but I did it.

411
00:34:47,156 --> 00:34:49,647
What are we gonna do about it?

412
00:34:51,294 --> 00:34:54,627
If I let you use the crematorium,
what's in it for me?

413
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,292
What do you want?

414
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:04,374
The way I see it,
this is a pretty big favor.

415
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:09,310
You got it! Whatever it is you want,
so help me, I'll do it. I promise.

416
00:35:12,516 --> 00:35:14,279
I'm sorry about that.

417
00:35:38,143 --> 00:35:40,044
Let's take care of your problem.

418
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:52,018
You're gonna owe me a big one.

419
00:35:52,124 --> 00:35:54,854
You're gonna get rid of everything for me.
Nothing left.

420
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:57,225
- Is that right?
- Everything'll go.

421
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:03,398
What about the bones?

422
00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:07,405
Bones are no problem.
The hardest thing to burn is the heart.

423
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,837
- The heart? Why?
- 'Cause it's just one big, tough muscle.

424
00:36:12,946 --> 00:36:16,507
Come on.
We don't want the heart sticking around.

425
00:36:16,616 --> 00:36:18,447
Then I'll turn it up hotter for it.

426
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,486
What about the split dogs? They got to go.

427
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:22,749
The split dogs will go, too.

428
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:29,023
Come on, just give me a hand.
It's your mess.

429
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:39,628
Some big favor.
I can operate that goddamn thing.

430
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:42,242
You're absolutely certain...

431
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,537
that this will get rid of everything
and do the trick?

432
00:36:45,647 --> 00:36:48,707
- Nothing left?
- Nothing but a little-bitty pile of ashes.

433
00:36:48,817 --> 00:36:50,546
We don't even want the ashes.

434
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:54,679
Then I'll turn it up higher,
and we'll burn up the ashes, too.

435
00:36:57,826 --> 00:36:59,384
Dust to dust.

436
00:37:57,289 --> 00:37:59,189
- My radio.
- Come on, you guys.

437
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:01,759
Let's get back to the car. Damn it.

438
00:38:02,094 --> 00:38:03,356
Come on.

439
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:19,972
Freddy?

440
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:22,342
Anybody?

441
00:38:22,515 --> 00:38:24,915
Get the fuckin' top! Fuck.

442
00:38:29,656 --> 00:38:30,850
Come on!

443
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:36,392
- Close the motherfuckin' windows.
- I don't have any windows.

444
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:37,862
I busted them.

445
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:41,465
- Hey, my skin burns.
- Me, too. Damn it.

446
00:38:41,568 --> 00:38:43,661
It's that rain, it's like acid rain.

447
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,237
Start the car!

448
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:47,864
It's all over me.
A towel, somebody give me a towel.

449
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:51,002
- We ain't got no towel!
- Well, then give me something.

450
00:38:51,112 --> 00:38:52,943
- Give me that.
- No!

451
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:55,878
Come on, start!

452
00:38:55,984 --> 00:38:58,646
- Suicide, get the car going.
- I'm trying.

453
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,053
Crap, I wonder what's in that rain.

454
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:19,500
It's coming down like
einen getrunken soldat.

455
00:39:47,537 --> 00:39:50,802
- Is the heart gone, Ernie?
- It's all burned up.

456
00:39:50,907 --> 00:39:53,069
- Are you sure?
- Right up the chimney.

457
00:39:53,177 --> 00:39:56,203
Goddamn, that's all we need.
We're home free, Frank.

458
00:39:56,314 --> 00:40:01,081
We got it made. You just saved our ass,
buddy boy, and I owe you one. Goddamn!

459
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:03,484
Yes, you do.

460
00:40:03,621 --> 00:40:07,113
Let's go to the warehouse, clean up,
and get the hell out of there.

461
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:08,522
What do you say, Frank?

462
00:40:08,626 --> 00:40:12,926
Okay, just give me a second to rest
and catch my breath. Then we'll go, okay?

463
00:40:13,097 --> 00:40:15,862
I don't know about you,
but I'm really sick.

464
00:40:15,968 --> 00:40:17,663
What's wrong, Fred?

465
00:40:17,936 --> 00:40:20,871
I feel like hell is what's wrong.
I'm really sick.

466
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:22,702
I'm sick, too, Burt.

467
00:40:23,075 --> 00:40:26,909
- Sick, like how?
- Like my head's going to bust wide open.

468
00:40:29,014 --> 00:40:33,951
- And I want to puke. And I'm weak, too.
- Me, too. I got the chills.

469
00:40:34,052 --> 00:40:36,954
It's that stuff, Burt.
It's that goddamn stuff we breathed.

470
00:40:37,056 --> 00:40:39,047
What stuff? What are you talking about?

471
00:40:39,158 --> 00:40:42,457
When that canister cracked,
this gas squirted out.

472
00:40:42,562 --> 00:40:44,587
It hit us right in the face.

473
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:46,355
We breathed it.

474
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,927
It knocked us out.

475
00:40:49,736 --> 00:40:52,967
- We were out cold, unconscious.
- Christ!

476
00:40:53,373 --> 00:40:55,568
Shouldn't we get to a doctor or something?

477
00:40:55,675 --> 00:40:56,938
Yeah, I need a doctor.

478
00:40:57,044 --> 00:41:00,343
I'm getting the car and taking
these guys to the emergency ward.

479
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:03,541
Let's go, Frank. You're gonna be
all right. I'm gonna get you...

480
00:41:03,651 --> 00:41:05,084
Hey, Frank!

481
00:41:11,992 --> 00:41:13,357
Come here, Ernie.

482
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,861
What's the matter? Talk to me.
Get him out of the rain.

483
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,636
I got to call my wife.
I gotta go to the hospital!

484
00:41:22,904 --> 00:41:26,101
You can't run around in this storm.
You're too sick.

485
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:27,367
Burt.

486
00:41:28,977 --> 00:41:30,877
Take it easy.

487
00:41:31,446 --> 00:41:33,914
- I'm gonna call an ambulance.
- Paramedics.

488
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:39,512
It's all right. How do you feel now?

489
00:41:45,594 --> 00:41:49,394
Hello. Yes. Can we get some paramedics
over here right away?

490
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:52,962
That's the Resurrection Funeral Home...

491
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,961
at 21702 East Central.

492
00:41:58,908 --> 00:42:02,640
Tell them to come around the back,
to the embalming room.

493
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:09,081
Poison. We have two men poisoned here.

494
00:42:10,053 --> 00:42:12,317
No, we don't know what kind of poison.

495
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,018
Right.

496
00:42:15,392 --> 00:42:17,383
Thank you very much. Bye.

497
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,158
Burt, they're on their way.

498
00:42:24,035 --> 00:42:26,526
- This car ain't going nowhere.
- Damn it.

499
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:29,436
Do you hear something?

500
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:31,106
Hear what?

501
00:42:31,509 --> 00:42:32,737
Something.

502
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:03,974
- No, I don't hear nothing.
- This roof's leaking.

503
00:43:04,077 --> 00:43:06,272
There's a rip, damn it. Shit.

504
00:43:06,379 --> 00:43:07,971
- Don't do that!
- Sorry.

505
00:43:08,081 --> 00:43:09,241
- Damn it!
- I'm sorry.

506
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:10,213
Shit, Scuz!

507
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,540
Hello, there?

508
00:43:13,186 --> 00:43:14,483
Freddy?

509
00:43:19,192 --> 00:43:20,682
Anybody?

510
00:43:36,043 --> 00:43:38,375
Freddy? Are you here?

511
00:43:57,566 --> 00:43:58,999
Anybody here?

512
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:25,620
Who's there?

513
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:30,089
Brains!

514
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,027
Brains!

515
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:40,540
- I got to get out of here.
- Let's go to where Tina and Freddy are.

516
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,475
- Damn right.
- Fuckin' A.

517
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:49,311
Live brain.

518
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:14,108
Come on, quick!

519
00:45:36,336 --> 00:45:38,668
God, my skin's really burning.

520
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,848
Hey, Tina!

521
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:52,609
Yes, God! Help me!

522
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,620
- That's Tina.
- What's she yelling about?

523
00:45:54,722 --> 00:45:57,122
- What's that sound?
- Through that door!

524
00:45:58,426 --> 00:46:00,291
Watch the fuckin' step!

525
00:46:00,895 --> 00:46:02,226
Help me!

526
00:46:02,863 --> 00:46:04,125
What the fuck?

527
00:46:09,604 --> 00:46:10,764
Brains!

528
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:26,248
More brains.

529
00:46:33,896 --> 00:46:37,627
Where the fuck you going?
Help me bar the door! Stupid fuckers!

530
00:46:54,752 --> 00:46:56,049
It's them.

531
00:46:59,957 --> 00:47:02,721
- Who took the poison?
- Right over there.

532
00:47:08,766 --> 00:47:10,859
Stick your tongue out for me.

533
00:47:19,144 --> 00:47:20,611
What did you guys take?

534
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:25,308
It was some kind of industrial chemical,
something in a tank.

535
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:29,681
- What tank? Where?
- Well, we're not sure, really.

536
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:33,188
Can you find out?
Your friends' lives may depend on it.

537
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:38,025
I got to make some phone calls,
but I can't do that before morning. Sorry.

538
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,391
Let's take some vital signs.

539
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,341
- Can I borrow your stethoscope?
- What's the matter?

540
00:47:50,443 --> 00:47:53,344
- I can't hear through mine.
- Are you sure it's the equipment?

541
00:47:53,446 --> 00:47:54,572
What do you mean?

542
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,275
I'm not getting anything on this, either.

543
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,347
What do you mean? What's wrong?

544
00:48:00,721 --> 00:48:04,623
It's all right. We just need
to double-check a couple things.

545
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:16,428
- No blood pressure.
- No pulse.

546
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:19,202
What do you mean,
"no blood pressure, no pulse"?

547
00:48:19,307 --> 00:48:20,740
Take it easy.

548
00:48:28,716 --> 00:48:30,411
- What do you have?
- 70.

549
00:48:30,518 --> 00:48:32,179
- 70 what?
- 70 degrees.

550
00:48:32,286 --> 00:48:34,754
- Well, what's that?
- Room temperature.

551
00:48:36,557 --> 00:48:39,789
Come over here for a second.
I want to talk to you.

552
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,768
What are you guys saying?

553
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:53,274
- What was that thing down there?
- What are we gonna do?

554
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:56,936
- Suicide is down there.
- No, he's gone. That thing ate his head.

555
00:48:57,045 --> 00:48:58,307
Jesus!

556
00:48:59,848 --> 00:49:02,818
- I don't hear anything down there.
- We got to call somebody.

557
00:49:02,919 --> 00:49:04,648
- Who?
- The cops.

558
00:49:04,754 --> 00:49:07,780
I don't want to call no cop.
They're just gonna kick our ass.

559
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:11,588
- Just let's get out of here, okay?
- We gotta call somebody.

560
00:49:11,795 --> 00:49:13,990
Wait a minute, where's Freddy?

561
00:49:39,456 --> 00:49:42,858
Holy shit. We're gonna have to swim
to get over there.

562
00:49:44,529 --> 00:49:47,054
- What the fuck was that?
- Look!

563
00:49:47,232 --> 00:49:48,460
There!

564
00:50:19,498 --> 00:50:22,467
Hey, wait up, you guys!
Wait, I got no shoes!

565
00:50:39,152 --> 00:50:41,712
You have no pulse, no blood pressure.

566
00:50:41,822 --> 00:50:46,351
You have no pupillary response, no
reflexes, your temperature is 70 degrees.

567
00:50:47,929 --> 00:50:49,294
What does that mean?

568
00:50:49,397 --> 00:50:52,833
It's a puzzle,
because technically you're not alive.

569
00:50:52,934 --> 00:50:55,698
Except you're conscious,
so we don't know what it means.

570
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:58,567
- Are you saying we're dead?
- Let's not jump to conclusions.

571
00:50:58,673 --> 00:51:01,437
Obviously, I didn't mean
you were really dead.

572
00:51:01,676 --> 00:51:04,270
Dead people don't move around and talk.

573
00:51:05,113 --> 00:51:06,979
- What is that?
- The front door.

574
00:51:07,082 --> 00:51:09,550
- What the fuck are they doing?
- I'll find out.

575
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:11,677
We're gonna get a couple of stretchers.

576
00:51:11,787 --> 00:51:14,551
Just hang in there. We won't be a second.

577
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,515
- Open the door.
- Open the door, please.

578
00:51:21,597 --> 00:51:24,088
- Open the door!
- Hurry up!

579
00:51:26,902 --> 00:51:29,633
- Freeze, or you're dead!
- Don't shoot, man!

580
00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:31,934
Are you crazy? Are you on PCP?

581
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:34,010
None of us are on any drugs. Let us in!

582
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:37,170
- All right, come in. But no funny moves.
- Shit, no.

583
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,679
Lock your doors and windows,
call the cops! They're out there!

584
00:51:40,784 --> 00:51:42,513
- Who?
- Don't you hear that?

585
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:44,780
- What?
- Shut up and listen, man!

586
00:51:47,657 --> 00:51:49,888
- What is it?
- It's dead people screaming.

587
00:51:49,994 --> 00:51:52,929
- What dead people?
- They came from out of the ground.

588
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:55,055
- And they're after us.
- Out of the ground?

589
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:58,033
Our friends took off the other way.
They're out there now!

590
00:52:01,038 --> 00:52:02,471
Brains!

591
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:17,249
- Trash? Where's Trash?
- Didn't she go with them?

592
00:52:17,356 --> 00:52:19,347
I thought she was with us.

593
00:52:21,693 --> 00:52:23,854
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

594
00:52:26,531 --> 00:52:28,055
Christ. Jesus.

595
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:31,965
- What is that?
- It sounds like people screaming.

596
00:52:32,772 --> 00:52:36,708
You get the stretchers,
I'll get on the radio and phone this in.

597
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:57,256
Jerry?

598
00:53:05,272 --> 00:53:06,864
Brain!

599
00:53:10,711 --> 00:53:13,840
- What kind of a problem?
- Take a look at it.

600
00:53:13,948 --> 00:53:15,939
What the hell's going on out here?

601
00:53:16,051 --> 00:53:19,179
That graveyard out there is full
of people coming out the ground.

602
00:53:19,287 --> 00:53:22,051
- "Out of the ground"?
- Out of the ground.

603
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,556
They're horrible, they scream.

604
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,489
- You've got to do something.
- Scream?

605
00:53:25,593 --> 00:53:29,051
Yes, they're out there.
There's one of them in that warehouse.

606
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,428
- Which warehouse?
- The medical supply house.

607
00:53:31,533 --> 00:53:32,932
Shit!

608
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:34,796
Goddamn!

609
00:53:34,904 --> 00:53:37,429
I think things are getting out of hand.

610
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,202
There's 100 of those things out there.

611
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:41,276
A hundred?

612
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:44,846
- The cops. We got to call the cops.
- Yeah. No shit.

613
00:53:45,548 --> 00:53:48,711
Phone. Where the fuck is the phone?

614
00:53:48,818 --> 00:53:50,718
There's an office!

615
00:53:55,659 --> 00:53:59,254
Hello, Operator, give me the police.
This is an emergency.

616
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Grab the hammer and nails! Casey!

617
00:54:08,238 --> 00:54:11,332
Quiet! Let's just get the hell
out of here, Ernie.

618
00:54:11,441 --> 00:54:13,204
- You got a car?
- I got a car.

619
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:16,438
- Get your keys. Let's get out of here.
- My clutch is shot.

620
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:18,947
We'll use the paramedic ambulance.

621
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:20,610
Freddy!

622
00:54:20,918 --> 00:54:22,010
- Ernie?
- Yeah?

623
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,487
- Where are the paramedics?
- I'll go get them. Get my own car started.

624
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:28,855
Oh, my God. What did they do to you?

625
00:55:11,304 --> 00:55:12,532
God!

626
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,197
- What was that shooting?
- God!

627
00:55:14,307 --> 00:55:16,366
- What?
- God!

628
00:55:19,045 --> 00:55:21,480
- What the hell?
- It...

629
00:55:24,185 --> 00:55:26,312
"It" what? What is "it"?

630
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,411
They're all over the cars.

631
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:31,184
It's horrible. They're out there.

632
00:55:32,493 --> 00:55:36,156
Paramedics are dead.
And we can't take the cars.

633
00:55:36,764 --> 00:55:39,733
We've got to call the police.

634
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:43,099
Set him down. Easy.

635
00:55:46,474 --> 00:55:48,408
- It's not working.
- Come on.

636
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:09,224
- What's the matter?
- Dead.

637
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:22,173
Help me.

638
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:32,351
You got some hammer and nails?

639
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:56,474
- Where else can they get in here?
- The windows in the chapel.

640
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:05,455
Get something to bar these windows with.

641
00:57:05,557 --> 00:57:07,548
I put boards outside the glass.

642
00:57:22,174 --> 00:57:25,871
Rescue 7, come in. This is Dispatch. Over.

643
00:57:29,149 --> 00:57:32,516
Rescue 7, this is Dispatch.
Do you copy? Over.

644
00:57:33,853 --> 00:57:35,616
Come in, Dispatch.

645
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:37,186
Send...

646
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,518
more...

647
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:40,024
paramedics.

648
00:57:55,676 --> 00:57:57,735
How many fucking windows you got here?

649
00:57:57,845 --> 00:57:59,574
No more windows.

650
00:58:00,348 --> 00:58:02,282
The embalming room has steel shutters.

651
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:05,784
Let's get the hell back
to the embalming room then.

652
00:58:10,425 --> 00:58:12,359
Man, my arms are dead.

653
00:58:12,461 --> 00:58:16,090
Put that goddamn thing down
before you hurt somebody with it.

654
00:58:16,298 --> 00:58:17,492
How they doing?

655
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,033
- Are you all right?
- It hurts.

656
00:58:20,135 --> 00:58:23,969
What did you do to Freddy?
What's wrong with him? And this man?

657
00:58:24,072 --> 00:58:26,370
It's time you tell us
what the fuck's going on.

658
00:58:26,475 --> 00:58:29,604
- I don't have to tell you anything.
- We think you should.

659
00:58:29,712 --> 00:58:31,304
Tell them, goddamn it!

660
00:58:33,182 --> 00:58:34,376
Tell us!

661
00:58:35,118 --> 00:58:36,813
There was a chemical.

662
00:58:38,087 --> 00:58:40,021
Some chemical soaked into the...

663
00:58:40,123 --> 00:58:43,217
soil of the graveyard
and made the corpses come back to life.

664
00:58:43,326 --> 00:58:47,092
- What fucking chemical?
- I don't know what chemical, goddamn it!

665
00:58:47,196 --> 00:58:49,892
It was ordered by the military,
I think it was.

666
00:58:49,999 --> 00:58:52,696
Would you tell me how
it got all over the graveyard?

667
00:58:52,803 --> 00:58:54,828
I don't know. I just...

668
00:58:55,205 --> 00:58:58,538
All I know is they were stored
over at the medical supply warehouse...

669
00:58:58,642 --> 00:59:02,669
where you were, and these two geniuses
managed to open the goddamn container...

670
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,715
and let the son of a bitch out.
Let 'em out!

671
00:59:05,816 --> 00:59:08,979
- Is that why Freddy's sick?
- I breathed it, Tina.

672
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,646
So did Frank there.

673
00:59:14,192 --> 00:59:17,161
- What did it do to you?
- I'm freezing.

674
00:59:18,196 --> 00:59:19,686
My muscles are stiffening up.

675
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,690
Stiffening up?

676
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,200
Stiffening up how?

677
00:59:24,302 --> 00:59:26,702
First, I got a really fucked headache.

678
00:59:27,372 --> 00:59:30,773
Then my stomach started cramping up.

679
00:59:31,376 --> 00:59:33,777
Now my arms and legs are cramping.

680
00:59:35,347 --> 00:59:38,282
- Let's take a look.
- Oh, God!

681
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,254
Let's get his shirt up.

682
00:59:44,156 --> 00:59:46,886
- What are you doing?
- Oh, God.

683
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,651
The bruises where he's lying down...

684
00:59:52,164 --> 00:59:54,030
that's blood pooling up.

685
00:59:56,403 --> 00:59:57,768
Easy.

686
01:00:00,106 --> 01:00:01,164
Okay.

687
01:00:05,612 --> 01:00:09,173
You know,
it looks like rigor mortis is setting in.

688
01:00:09,683 --> 01:00:12,948
Rigor mortis?
What do you mean, rigor mortis?

689
01:00:13,954 --> 01:00:16,890
God, you're dead.

690
01:00:16,991 --> 01:00:19,858
You're dead, and you'll turn
into one of those things.

691
01:00:19,961 --> 01:00:20,950
No!

692
01:00:23,798 --> 01:00:25,789
- Let him go!
- Son of a bitch!

693
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:31,930
Do you hear that?

694
01:00:35,944 --> 01:00:39,141
- What is that?
- It's another paramedic ambulance.

695
01:00:50,325 --> 01:00:53,385
- Watch out!
- Don't go over there!

696
01:00:58,935 --> 01:01:00,368
Damn!

697
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:03,439
They're gonna kill everybody
that comes here.

698
01:01:22,693 --> 01:01:25,958
Watch out,
I'm going to put the board back up.

699
01:01:29,867 --> 01:01:31,232
It's got me!

700
01:01:48,253 --> 01:01:50,187
Get this thing out of here!

701
01:01:51,756 --> 01:01:53,724
Pull her off.

702
01:01:56,361 --> 01:01:57,225
Christ.

703
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:00,294
Damn, he's dead. Shit.

704
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:03,164
What do we do with this thing?

705
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:07,236
- Just wait there a second.
- Let's get out of here.

706
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:10,639
- Where the fuck is he going?
- What are you doing?

707
01:02:15,014 --> 01:02:16,504
Let me take it!

708
01:02:16,782 --> 01:02:19,615
- You can let go of it now.
- Are you crazy?

709
01:02:20,419 --> 01:02:23,685
Look at it. She looks better now.

710
01:02:25,759 --> 01:02:27,454
We got to get out of here.

711
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,986
We got to get the fuck out of here.

712
01:02:31,398 --> 01:02:32,695
Leave it.

713
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:36,160
What are you doing? Goddamn it!

714
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,798
I don't understand what you want with it.

715
01:02:39,906 --> 01:02:42,432
- What are we doing with it?
- I want to examine it.

716
01:02:42,543 --> 01:02:45,512
- You make sure it's tied right.
- It's being tied right.

717
01:02:45,613 --> 01:02:49,640
- It's not gonna get loose, right?
- No, it's not gonna get loose.

718
01:02:49,751 --> 01:02:52,185
They're no stronger than humans.

719
01:02:58,359 --> 01:03:01,658
- Don't be afraid.
- I'll bust it in the damn head.

720
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:04,131
You sure that thing's tied good?

721
01:03:05,734 --> 01:03:08,362
- You can hear me?
- Yes.

722
01:03:12,741 --> 01:03:14,072
Why do you eat people?

723
01:03:14,476 --> 01:03:17,809
Not people, brains.

724
01:03:17,913 --> 01:03:20,313
- Brains only?
- Yes.

725
01:03:21,884 --> 01:03:25,048
- Why?
- The pain.

726
01:03:26,222 --> 01:03:30,784
- What about the pain?
- The pain of being dead.

727
01:03:36,232 --> 01:03:37,859
It hurts to be dead.

728
01:03:39,369 --> 01:03:43,169
I can feel myself rot.

729
01:03:45,175 --> 01:03:46,905
Eating brains...

730
01:03:47,912 --> 01:03:50,346
how does that make you feel?

731
01:03:50,548 --> 01:03:52,880
It makes the pain...

732
01:03:53,384 --> 01:03:54,976
go away.

733
01:04:01,025 --> 01:04:05,325
Look, man, fuck this.
I got to talk to you. Now.

734
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,193
Come on, I got to talk. We got to talk.

735
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:14,297
Let's talk out in the hall.

736
01:04:19,878 --> 01:04:23,211
Look, how can we kill those things?

737
01:04:23,615 --> 01:04:25,014
You don't.

738
01:04:25,183 --> 01:04:26,878
What do you mean, "you don't"?

739
01:04:26,985 --> 01:04:29,250
You can't kill them, they're already dead.

740
01:04:29,355 --> 01:04:31,949
They're not living creatures,
they're animated.

741
01:04:32,058 --> 01:04:35,289
You can chop them up into pieces,
they'll still come after you.

742
01:04:35,394 --> 01:04:37,055
All you can do is burn them.

743
01:04:37,163 --> 01:04:40,758
You got to reduce them to ashes,
so there's nothing left to come after you.

744
01:04:40,867 --> 01:04:42,960
How you gonna burn all those things?

745
01:04:43,069 --> 01:04:47,733
- There's 100 of those fuckers.
- That is the question.

746
01:05:47,703 --> 01:05:49,568
We have a 10-32 from EMS.

747
01:05:49,672 --> 01:05:53,439
Two, repeat, two paramedic vehicles
missing in the East Piedmont district.

748
01:05:53,543 --> 01:05:55,340
Request a 10-51, Code 3.

749
01:05:55,445 --> 01:05:59,211
Available units near the 20,000 block
of East Central, please respond, over.

750
01:05:59,616 --> 01:06:01,880
Do you think they'll rescue us?

751
01:06:02,919 --> 01:06:05,581
They better. That's all I got to say.

752
01:06:11,161 --> 01:06:13,323
But do you think they will?

753
01:06:21,739 --> 01:06:22,763
Chuck?

754
01:06:24,542 --> 01:06:26,305
I never did like you.

755
01:06:28,112 --> 01:06:30,876
Oh, my God, hold me tight.

756
01:06:32,049 --> 01:06:35,383
I think it would be a lot wiser
if we contained Frank and Freddy.

757
01:06:35,487 --> 01:06:38,320
- You know what I'm saying?
- What do you mean, "contained"?

758
01:06:38,423 --> 01:06:42,291
Lock them up, so if they started
acting funny, they wouldn't hurt anybody.

759
01:06:42,394 --> 01:06:43,861
They don't want to hurt anybody.

760
01:06:43,962 --> 01:06:46,294
You bastard!
Why don't you lock yourselves up?

761
01:06:46,398 --> 01:06:49,492
We're not proposing doing
anything to them, for Christ's sake.

762
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:53,332
We want to lock them up so we can
figure out how to get the hell out of here.

763
01:06:53,438 --> 01:06:55,703
Tina, that really is a good idea.

764
01:06:55,808 --> 01:06:59,539
- Where can we put them?
- Yeah, well, the chapel.

765
01:06:59,712 --> 01:07:02,306
All right, help me with Frank, please.

766
01:07:02,415 --> 01:07:04,383
- Lift his feet.
- Come on.

767
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:20,998
On the rug.

768
01:07:23,304 --> 01:07:25,670
Lay them on the carpet, gently.

769
01:07:26,674 --> 01:07:27,868
Easy.

770
01:07:28,142 --> 01:07:31,077
Easy. It's all right. Can you hear me?

771
01:07:31,578 --> 01:07:33,273
Boy, he's gone.

772
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:37,212
Freddy.

773
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,479
Let's just leave them and get out.

774
01:07:40,588 --> 01:07:44,354
- I'm not leaving Freddy.
- We got to lock the door, you know?

775
01:07:45,493 --> 01:07:46,619
I'm staying.

776
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:50,791
Okay. Come on.

777
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,868
Dispatch. This is Bravo 751.

778
01:08:04,981 --> 01:08:06,608
We're at the mortuary.

779
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:11,551
We see two, that is two, paramedic
vehicles parked in the rear parking lot.

780
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:16,655
The doors on one vehicle are hanging open.
Stand by while we investigate. Over.

781
01:08:41,085 --> 01:08:42,848
I got a man down.

782
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:48,751
Jesus!

783
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:53,993
Hold it right there!

784
01:08:54,098 --> 01:08:57,067
Freeze or I'll blow
your fucking brains out!

785
01:09:00,938 --> 01:09:02,497
This place...

786
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:05,039
Everybody that comes in...

787
01:09:05,711 --> 01:09:07,076
gets swallowed up.

788
01:09:08,247 --> 01:09:10,044
Send more cops.

789
01:09:10,482 --> 01:09:11,449
What do we do?

790
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:14,542
Stand here,
beating our meat till the corpses bust in?

791
01:09:14,653 --> 01:09:16,678
We can't stop them. We got to get out.

792
01:09:16,789 --> 01:09:17,881
We got to get to the cars.

793
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:20,254
- There's corpses all over the cars.
- I know.

794
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:21,724
What are you proposing?

795
01:09:21,827 --> 01:09:25,264
What am I proposing?
I think we all should do some proposing.

796
01:09:25,365 --> 01:09:28,857
The crawlspace in the ceiling.
We could go up, barricade ourselves in.

797
01:09:28,968 --> 01:09:31,528
Only way up is the hatch,
and we could nail that shut.

798
01:09:31,638 --> 01:09:35,165
You must be out of your mind.
I'm not barricading myself in no roof.

799
01:09:35,275 --> 01:09:37,402
I'd rather take my chances with the cars.

800
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:39,000
We need a way to fight them.

801
01:09:39,112 --> 01:09:40,602
How about this?

802
01:09:41,214 --> 01:09:42,306
What is that?

803
01:09:42,415 --> 01:09:45,385
It's nitric acid.
Pretty much destroy anything.

804
01:09:45,486 --> 01:09:47,977
But there's not enough of it.

805
01:09:57,832 --> 01:09:59,459
It hurts!

806
01:10:01,268 --> 01:10:04,169
- It hurts more than you can imagine.
- I know.

807
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:09,670
Freddy!

808
01:10:20,956 --> 01:10:22,821
I can finally see...

809
01:10:23,592 --> 01:10:25,219
the one thing...

810
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:29,130
that can relieve this horrible suffering.

811
01:10:29,232 --> 01:10:30,859
What?

812
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,564
Live brains!

813
01:11:18,383 --> 01:11:19,748
Get the girl!

814
01:11:22,687 --> 01:11:24,279
Run!

815
01:11:26,558 --> 01:11:28,219
Put her on the couch.

816
01:11:29,395 --> 01:11:31,522
They got Freddy.

817
01:11:32,631 --> 01:11:35,031
It was horrible, ugly, man.

818
01:11:35,568 --> 01:11:38,162
His face was all fucked up.

819
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:42,066
He's not Freddy.

820
01:11:42,174 --> 01:11:43,801
Brains.

821
01:11:46,212 --> 01:11:48,874
Make her shut up.

822
01:11:50,717 --> 01:11:52,048
Brains.

823
01:12:01,695 --> 01:12:03,856
Shit, he's trying to get out.

824
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:05,463
Get a bench, come on.

825
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,163
Out of the way!

826
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:19,173
Bring it against it. It's all right.

827
01:12:20,615 --> 01:12:22,913
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Get up!

828
01:12:23,751 --> 01:12:26,276
We can't stay here.
It's gonna bust through the door.

829
01:12:26,387 --> 01:12:28,082
We got to run for the cars.

830
01:12:29,123 --> 01:12:31,057
There's zombies all over the cars.

831
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:34,128
Got to fight our way through them,
there's no other way.

832
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:37,357
Once we're in the car and moving,
I think we'll be all right.

833
01:12:37,466 --> 01:12:39,400
That's a big fucking "if," man.

834
01:12:40,269 --> 01:12:43,329
I can't walk, much less run.

835
01:12:43,872 --> 01:12:45,669
How bad is your foot?

836
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:48,170
It's broke.

837
01:12:58,588 --> 01:13:01,386
We get one of the cars,
bring it near the door.

838
01:13:01,491 --> 01:13:05,188
Police car. It should still have
the keys in the ignition.

839
01:13:05,328 --> 01:13:07,193
The motor is still running.

840
01:13:07,297 --> 01:13:09,857
- Good. I'll drive.
- No, I'll drive.

841
01:13:09,966 --> 01:13:11,228
Fuck you.

842
01:13:11,334 --> 01:13:14,395
When we drive up here,
I don't want to hang out there long.

843
01:13:14,505 --> 01:13:17,235
You stand right here.
Put one hand here and another here.

844
01:13:17,341 --> 01:13:19,366
When I say "now," you open the door fast.

845
01:13:19,476 --> 01:13:22,206
The minute we're through,
you slam it hard and lock it.

846
01:13:23,547 --> 01:13:26,175
Get your ass over here at the door.

847
01:13:32,489 --> 01:13:33,820
Burt...

848
01:13:34,525 --> 01:13:38,519
That favor that you owe me.
Watch your ass out there.

849
01:13:42,534 --> 01:13:43,831
All right, stand by.

850
01:13:48,473 --> 01:13:49,633
Now!

851
01:14:16,268 --> 01:14:18,464
You got to get closer. They can't make it.

852
01:14:18,572 --> 01:14:21,439
- We got to split.
- No, we can't split.

853
01:14:28,582 --> 01:14:30,641
They left us, those jerks!

854
01:14:32,018 --> 01:14:33,383
They had to.

855
01:14:34,821 --> 01:14:36,482
Burt will send help.

856
01:14:37,224 --> 01:14:38,589
I know him.

857
01:14:39,127 --> 01:14:40,560
They left us.

858
01:14:42,096 --> 01:14:45,588
- What are you doing? We can't leave.
- They'd have turned the car over.

859
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,792
We'll send help.

860
01:14:46,901 --> 01:14:50,530
- Those are my fucking friends back there.
- I said we'll send help.

861
01:14:50,638 --> 01:14:52,196
- Coward!
- Fuck you!

862
01:14:55,343 --> 01:14:56,640
Hang on, here we go!

863
01:14:58,546 --> 01:15:01,778
- What the fuck are we gonna do now?
- Find a phone, call the cops.

864
01:15:01,884 --> 01:15:04,512
- What the fuck?
- Jesus H. Christ!

865
01:15:06,522 --> 01:15:07,648
Shit!

866
01:15:12,494 --> 01:15:14,189
Back to the warehouse!

867
01:15:24,641 --> 01:15:26,268
This way, you stupid honky!

868
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:28,108
That's Spider.

869
01:15:32,081 --> 01:15:34,174
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know.

870
01:15:34,284 --> 01:15:36,445
- Who's he?
- He owns this place.

871
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,947
That fucking car is totaled.

872
01:15:39,055 --> 01:15:42,753
That's all right.
My car is still out there. So is Frank's.

873
01:15:44,695 --> 01:15:45,662
Not anymore.

874
01:16:16,862 --> 01:16:18,420
Tina!

875
01:16:23,268 --> 01:16:24,634
Where are you?

876
01:16:42,355 --> 01:16:43,686
Forgive me.

877
01:17:33,876 --> 01:17:37,277
Ground, this is Air 4, we got
a bad situation. We got officers down.

878
01:17:37,379 --> 01:17:39,574
We have just witnessed
ground units attacked.

879
01:17:40,683 --> 01:17:42,014
Helicopter!

880
01:17:42,418 --> 01:17:45,649
Attention. This is the police.

881
01:17:45,754 --> 01:17:48,315
This area is under police blockade.

882
01:17:48,425 --> 01:17:51,986
All persons within this area wishing
to surrender should make their way...

883
01:17:52,095 --> 01:17:54,188
to the perimeter at once.

884
01:17:54,898 --> 01:17:56,058
Jesus.

885
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:59,260
It sounds like the shit's
hitting the fan out there.

886
01:17:59,369 --> 01:18:02,167
- We got to let them know we're here.
- You better believe it.

887
01:18:02,272 --> 01:18:03,705
Hey, mister!

888
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:06,338
Don't go in there.

889
01:18:06,443 --> 01:18:09,344
There's a thing in there.
It ripped out the phone.

890
01:18:09,947 --> 01:18:11,505
There's another in the basement.

891
01:18:11,616 --> 01:18:13,948
The basement's fucked!
You know what's in there?

892
01:18:14,051 --> 01:18:16,178
- What do you mean?
- One of those corpses.

893
01:18:16,287 --> 01:18:18,847
A real ugly one, all black and slimy.

894
01:18:19,223 --> 01:18:22,351
I don't care what's in the basement,
we got to get to that phone.

895
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,486
Blinding them seems to work okay,
doesn't it?

896
01:18:26,697 --> 01:18:28,289
Wait a minute.

897
01:18:30,134 --> 01:18:34,595
Spider, open the door.
I'm going to knock his goddamn block off.

898
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:40,508
It was wrong for you to lock me up.
I had to hurt myself to get out.

899
01:18:41,113 --> 01:18:43,172
But I forgive you, darling.

900
01:18:43,815 --> 01:18:45,840
And I know you're here...

901
01:18:46,151 --> 01:18:48,813
because I can smell your brains.

902
01:18:50,222 --> 01:18:51,519
Go away!

903
01:18:51,624 --> 01:18:53,455
I'm coming up, Tina.

904
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:10,374
Now you made me hurt myself again.

905
01:19:10,877 --> 01:19:14,405
You made me break my hand
completely off this time, Tina.

906
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:18,245
But I don't care, darling...

907
01:19:18,686 --> 01:19:20,449
because I love you.

908
01:19:21,255 --> 01:19:25,783
You've got to let me eat your brain.

909
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,341
Open the goddamn door.

910
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:46,846
Brains!

911
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:52,347
Get him down.

912
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:56,357
All right, you guys, go.
Get in there, come on, fast. Get in!

913
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:03,128
Watch it, the step's out.

914
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:12,202
Jesus Christ.

915
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:17,642
That's our friend. The Tarman got him.

916
01:20:26,123 --> 01:20:27,681
Give me the police.

917
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:29,925
It's an emergency, Operator.

918
01:20:30,927 --> 01:20:32,622
Captain, over here.

919
01:20:37,268 --> 01:20:39,532
- Yes, go ahead.
- You've got to help us.

920
01:20:39,637 --> 01:20:42,731
There's a bunch of us inside your barricade,
and we can't get out.

921
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,434
First of all,
what the hell is going on in there?

922
01:20:45,543 --> 01:20:48,569
I lost a dozen good men,
and nobody can tell me jack shit.

923
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:51,705
There are people in the cemetery
who are stark, staring mad.

924
01:20:51,816 --> 01:20:53,340
They'll kill you and eat you.

925
01:20:53,451 --> 01:20:56,011
It's like a disease, it's like rabies,
only faster.

926
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:59,682
That's why you got to come in here
and get us out now. Please.

927
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:03,253
Just a minute, I can't hear.
There's a lot of noise out here.

928
01:21:03,362 --> 01:21:05,557
What the hell's going on?

929
01:21:05,764 --> 01:21:08,096
Halt! I said halt!

930
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,100
- Watch it.
- They're crazy!

931
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,354
- What?
- What is it?

932
01:21:33,259 --> 01:21:34,886
They got the cops.

933
01:21:35,395 --> 01:21:38,990
That means they're breaking out
of the barricade. Jesus Christ.

934
01:21:46,106 --> 01:21:47,733
What's he doing?

935
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:50,604
What are you doing?

936
01:21:57,685 --> 01:21:58,811
Hello?

937
01:21:59,987 --> 01:22:02,582
I'm calling the number
stenciled on the tank.

938
01:22:02,691 --> 01:22:05,660
- Your name, please?
- Burt Wilson.

939
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,127
Stay on the line, Mr. Wilson.
You're being transferred.

940
01:22:09,231 --> 01:22:10,960
This is Com-Q, Denver, go ahead.

941
01:22:11,066 --> 01:22:15,366
Denver, this is Wichita. I've got a
CLY priority on a 114. Who's up?

942
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:18,439
That would be Col. Glover, San Diego.
I'll put you through.

943
01:22:21,943 --> 01:22:22,933
Yes?

944
01:22:24,313 --> 01:22:25,678
Yes, Captain.

945
01:22:27,183 --> 01:22:29,242
- I see. Very well.
- Horace.

946
01:22:29,785 --> 01:22:32,379
- Put the call through to me.
- What is it?

947
01:22:32,488 --> 01:22:34,718
Yes, put him on.

948
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:39,157
Mr. Wilson, where are you calling from?

949
01:22:40,863 --> 01:22:43,526
I see. When did this take place?

950
01:22:44,601 --> 01:22:47,161
And when was the tank first breached?

951
01:22:48,105 --> 01:22:50,665
Why didn't you call
this number immediately?

952
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:54,705
I see. It's understandable.
What happened next?

953
01:22:57,915 --> 01:23:00,748
You did? And what effect did that have?

954
01:23:04,822 --> 01:23:06,619
What did you do then?

955
01:23:09,027 --> 01:23:10,790
And what did they do?

956
01:23:11,796 --> 01:23:12,956
I see.

957
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:16,394
Really?

958
01:23:17,101 --> 01:23:18,932
How many did you say?

959
01:23:20,071 --> 01:23:23,336
And how many acres
does this cemetery cover, sir?

960
01:23:24,175 --> 01:23:25,267
Yes.

961
01:23:26,412 --> 01:23:27,572
I see.

962
01:23:29,381 --> 01:23:30,439
Yes, I see.

963
01:23:30,549 --> 01:23:33,677
Of course. Thank you
for your assistance, Mr. Wilson.

964
01:23:33,786 --> 01:23:36,584
I'll switch you back to Capt. Turner.
He'll talk to you.

965
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,351
Sir, this is Col. Glover.

966
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:13,558
I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour,
but we're at Q-2 status.

967
01:24:13,794 --> 01:24:17,662
It looks like we've found
that lost consignment of Easter eggs.

968
01:24:20,101 --> 01:24:23,662
Yes, sir, pretty sure.
They've turned up in Louisville.

969
01:24:23,771 --> 01:24:28,174
I'm getting confirmations on this
from the Louisville Police Department.

970
01:24:28,275 --> 01:24:30,267
Louisville, Kentucky, sir.

971
01:24:32,047 --> 01:24:36,245
It would be good news,
except that the eggs have hatched.

972
01:24:36,485 --> 01:24:38,009
What are they doing?

973
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,849
Hang on a second, would you?

974
01:24:39,955 --> 01:24:43,789
It's weird. These people seem to say
they've been waiting for this to happen.

975
01:24:43,892 --> 01:24:47,225
Apparently, they've got some sort of
contingency plan to deal with it.

976
01:24:47,329 --> 01:24:50,163
- That's great!
- What is this plan?

977
01:24:52,068 --> 01:24:56,528
Sgt. Jefferson, 42nd Special
Mobile Artillery. Yes, sir.

978
01:24:56,906 --> 01:24:59,101
Good morning to you, too, sir.

979
01:25:00,076 --> 01:25:04,410
Yes, sir. Whatever you say, sir.
The code numbers please, sir.

980
01:25:04,514 --> 01:25:07,210
Archimedes. Hotdog. Rhubarb.

981
01:25:07,383 --> 01:25:10,284
Niner. Zero. Niner. Gotcha, sir.

982
01:25:11,422 --> 01:25:13,913
Bearing. Mark 2-2-0.

983
01:25:14,024 --> 01:25:16,390
Bearing, 2-2-0.

984
01:25:18,562 --> 01:25:21,429
Range. Mark 134 miles.

985
01:25:21,899 --> 01:25:24,527
Range, 1-3-4 miles.

986
01:25:39,984 --> 01:25:41,679
Hey, listen.

987
01:25:43,254 --> 01:25:44,687
You hear anything?

988
01:25:45,857 --> 01:25:47,449
Tina.

989
01:26:07,146 --> 01:26:08,943
Spectacular result, sir.

990
01:26:09,281 --> 01:26:11,579
Very close to optimal placement.

991
01:26:12,551 --> 01:26:15,077
Only 20 square blocks destroyed.

992
01:26:15,188 --> 01:26:17,088
Less than 4,000 dead, General.

993
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:22,184
I wouldn't worry about the fires, General.
The rain is taking care of that right now.

994
01:26:22,596 --> 01:26:26,293
There have been complaints
about burning skin, but I shouldn't worry.

995
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:30,267
Minor irritation, General.
The rain will wash everything away.

996
01:26:30,437 --> 01:26:33,929
That's correct, sir.
All should be back to normal by morning.

997
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:37,442
I understand the President
will visit Louisville tomorrow.

998
01:26:37,545 --> 01:26:40,446
No, we wouldn't want that to happen, sir.

999
01:26:40,648 --> 01:26:43,583
No, this hasn't been
very pleasant for anyone.

1000
01:26:44,685 --> 01:26:46,880
Thank you, sir. Goodnight, sir.

1001
01:27:02,204 --> 01:27:03,762
More brains!

1002
01:27:04,506 --> 01:27:08,033
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna kill it!

1003
01:27:10,112 --> 01:27:11,272
It's all over everything.

1004
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:14,679
- Stupid asshole!
- Watch your tongue if you like this job.

1005
01:27:14,783 --> 01:27:15,875
Like this job?

1006
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:19,216
Burt? Frank.

1007
01:27:19,789 --> 01:27:21,279
We have a little problem.

1008
01:27:24,994 --> 01:27:27,155
Do you ever fantasize...

1009
01:27:28,298 --> 01:27:29,663
about being killed?

1010
01:27:31,935 --> 01:27:35,166
- The brain!
- I hit the fucking brain.

1011
01:27:35,538 --> 01:27:38,303
- How do you kill something that's dead?
- How do I know?

1012
01:27:38,409 --> 01:27:41,105
- I don't know, let me think.
- It's not a bad question.

1013
01:27:41,212 --> 01:27:42,509
What do you think this is about?

1014
01:27:42,613 --> 01:27:45,878
You think this is a fuckin' costume?
This is a way of life!

1015
01:27:45,983 --> 01:27:49,009
- There's 100 of those fuckers.
- A hundred?

1016
01:27:49,286 --> 01:27:51,186
Brains!

1017
01:27:53,224 --> 01:27:54,919
Send more cops.

1018
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:58,995
I think things are getting out of hand.

1019
01:28:00,765 --> 01:28:02,323
Get it off!

1020
01:28:05,403 --> 01:28:08,031
- It worked in the movie.
- It ain't working now.

1021
01:28:08,139 --> 01:28:09,800
You mean the movie lied?

1022
01:28:09,908 --> 01:28:12,103
It's not a bad question, Burt.
