1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,270
Yeah,

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,519
You're a good boy,

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,629
come with me now when Mommy and Daddy go.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,379
Be good, son, back in a couple of weeks.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,659
Don't forget to tell me if
they like the preserves.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,529
Oh, you're so sweet.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,869
You be good now, Billy.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,159
Don't give Auntie Cheryl any trouble.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,309
You be careful.

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,259
Mommy and Daddy are
going over the mountains

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,599
all the way to the Pacific coast

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,459
to see Grandma and Grandpa.

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,119
Remember, we had to
change hotels in Cedar City.

14
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,319
Bye, Daddy.
Bye.

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,860
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mommy.

16
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,649
Bye-bye, Honey.

17
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,609
Bye!

18
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,930
Bye-bye.

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,380
I love you.

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,490
The champs, the Packers,

21
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:00,639
and what a game.

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,079
The mighty Green Bay Packers,

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,879
who have dominated the
National Football League

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,249
for the past few years
with an unprecedented

25
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,919
three consecutive NFL championships,

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,529
were the winners of the first Super Bowl,

27
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,959
defeating the Kansas City Chiefs

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,579
by a score of 35 to 10.

29
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,679
For many, the Packers
win came as no surprise.

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,219
Billy looks so cute in that
baseball cap you bought him.

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,949
I miss him already.

32
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,780
The over-powered their rival

33
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:26,099
lightening their lead 14 to 10 at the half.

34
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,530
To a 25 point margin.

35
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,720
The brakes are gone!

36
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,530
My God!

37
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,010
What's going on!

38
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,999
The President and Mrs. Reagan will attend.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,009
The President is also
expected to announce his

40
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,699
new energy policy later today.

41
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,219
Stayed tuned to KEOS

42
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,109
for full world and
national news at 7 o'clock.

43
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,139
In local news, gasoline
prices are climbing again.

44
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,289
Flagstaff dealers say the average price

45
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,450
of a gallon by April, $1.45.

46
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,149
KEOS weather, sunny and warmer today,

47
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,349
with high's in the mid to
upper 60s, here at Flagstaff.

48
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,139
60 up in the canyon.

49
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,269
62 in Sedona, and 82 in the Phoenix area.

50
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,510
Increasing clouds toward-

51
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,420
Billy.

52
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,989
Wake up, Sweetie.

53
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,999
Five more minutes.

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,319
Okay, Billy.

55
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,420
But you're beginning to make this a habit.

56
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,060
Gonna have to start getting you up earlier.

57
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,249
Five more minutes.

58
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,520
Right.

59
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,070
Yeah!

60
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,539
Billy, don't eat that now!

61
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,779
I just made you breakfast.

62
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,690
Well can't you freeze it?

63
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:22,790
I gotta pick up Julie on my way to school.

64
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,609
What am I going to do with you?

65
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,440
What's the matter?

66
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:28,239
Do you see this?

67
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,979
This is a glass.

68
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,689
We use this for drinking.

69
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,470
Why dirty a glass?

70
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,139
I was thinking,

71
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,259
can I invite Julie over
for my birthday dinner?

72
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,879
Julie again? Sounds serious.

73
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,319
I think she's got a crush on me.

74
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
She does?

75
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,289
Billy's got a girlfriend, Billy...

76
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,130
Billy!

77
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:53,759
Don't do that, that's disgusting.

78
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,619
I am going to be your date tomorrow night.

79
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,239
Sorry.

80
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,979
Whatever makes you happy.

81
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,759
I'll see you tonight.

82
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,570
You make me happy.

83
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Yeah.

84
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,559
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine!

85
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,589
You guys look like a basketball team!

86
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,390
All right, c'mon, set
'em up now, set 'em up!

87
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,429
All right, let's go, let's go,

88
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,660
shoot the other way now!

89
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,149
Pass the ball, c'mon!

90
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,209
Hey, that's a foul! Foul!

91
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,040
You only say foul,

92
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
because you're trying to
dribble through him now!

93
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,169
Eddie, you gotta move the ball to back,

94
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,379
you can't dribble through the guy.

95
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,669
C'mon let's go, let's bring it back.

96
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,709
Let's go, shirts!

97
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,329
Shirts ball, get back!

98
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,259
Watch your back door!

99
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,110
All right, you traveled now,

100
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:04,889
let's go, let's go back
the other way, here we go!

101
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,739
Set 'em up, set 'em up, here we go, c'mon!

102
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,610
Get 'em up, that's right.

103
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,440
C'mon!

104
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:10,340
C'mon, Eddie, play some defense, son!

105
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,679
All right, that's good,
that's good, good job.

106
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,510
Now get out of here,

107
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:14,589
I'm tired of looking at 'ya.

108
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,549
It's a good practice, Russ.

109
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,899
Billy, can I talk to you for a second?

110
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,730
Sure.

111
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,870
Good practice, looking
good, good, all right.

112
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,329
Listen, Eddie, I gotta talk
to Billy for just a second.

113
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,269
Listen, I'll talk to you
tomorrow, all right?

114
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,270
Go work out.

115
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,559
I got some great news for you.

116
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,979
I'd like you to meet me in my office

117
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,699
right after you shower, all right?

118
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,989
Hey, check it out.

119
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,169
Look at him, will you?

120
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,449
The coach's number one wimp.

121
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,239
Gee Julia, I gotta meet
Coach after I shower.

122
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,760
Oh, that's okay.
Thanks.

123
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,590
C'mon, let's go inside.

124
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,230
Hey, Lynch.

125
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,950
Next time keep your queer
hands off of me, okay?

126
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,289
I don't like to be touched.

127
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,549
Knock it off, Eddie.

128
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,639
I didn't foul you.

129
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,470
Bull!

130
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,019
Hey, what are you getting
so hot about, now, huh?

131
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,169
We're on the same team.

132
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,759
Yeah, I know.

133
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,899
It's just that some of us
think we're better than others.

134
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,110
Some of us are better than others.

135
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,870
We'll find out about that.

136
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,969
Oh thanks, Cheryl, you're a life saver.

137
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,169
Hope he wasn't too much trouble.

138
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,279
No, he's good as gold.

139
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,439
Just a minute, Frank.

140
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,719
What about tomorrow
night? Do you need any help?

141
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,220
No Marge, I'm okay.
Okay.

142
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,789
Listen! Frank knows this guy at work.

143
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,139
35 years old, a real hunk.

144
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,249
Margie, I'm not interested in dates,

145
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,380
blind, or otherwise.

146
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,809
In a minute, Frank!

147
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,329
You know, Billy's gonna be 17-

148
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,160
Bye, Margie.

149
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,449
You're gonna need a man around the house!

150
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,239
Oh, I know, I know.

151
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,390
See you tomorrow, thanks
for the pickled tomatoes!

152
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
I am coming!

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Gotcha!

154
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,159
Julie, I hate it when you do that.

155
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,479
What are you doing here, anyway?

156
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,969
Well, I thought that you'd think-

157
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,359
You thought that I was going-

158
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,939
You think, forget it.
All right.

159
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,159
What took you so long?

160
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,639
I had to meet with Coach Landers.

161
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,410
For an hour? It's 6 o'clock.

162
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,699
Oh, six.

163
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,149
Hey listen, Julie, can I talk to you later?

164
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,389
See I didn't call Aunt Cheryl,

165
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,159
and you know how she gets about dinner.

166
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,319
Call her now.

167
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,169
I can't, I gotta go home.

168
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,359
There's something I
gotta talk to her about.

169
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,510
Okay, I didn't mean to upset you.

170
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,250
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,269
How about I give you a
ride home on my moped?

172
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,499
Billy, I'm wearing a skirt.

173
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,670
You can ride side side-saddle with me.

174
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,989
You are late.

175
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,259
And I'm fixing your favorite.

176
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,209
The meat sauce will never forgive you.

177
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,680
I had to take Julie home.

178
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,969
I had a long talk with
Coach Landers this afternoon.

179
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,599
He's got great news!

180
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,639
Oh.
Yeah.

181
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,569
See he thinks I can get a full scholarship

182
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,209
to the University of Denver.

183
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,599
And there's a scout, he's
coming out to our next game.

184
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,309
Well, what do you think, huh?

185
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,310
What do I think?

186
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,350
Forget it.

187
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,369
You got a job next
year, I've set it all up.

188
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,170
Yeah, but this is a
full athletic scholarship!

189
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,489
Denver, that's where
Julie's going, isn't it?

190
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,490
Yeah.

191
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,329
Gee, that'd be nice.

192
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,479
College is for rich kids
and people with brains.

193
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,999
You wouldn't fit in there.

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,530
You never said that before.

195
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,559
You always said we couldn't afford it.

196
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,679
You didn't say you didn't want me.

197
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,919
Well, I don't want you to!

198
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,130
We can't afford it.

199
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,379
Besides, I thought you were gonna stay here

200
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,919
and contribute something.

201
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,919
All we have left is Mommy's house.

202
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,319
But I was figuring you'd sell this place.

203
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,629
It's too big for you, anyway.

204
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,769
All my life, I've lived in this house.

205
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,819
All my memories are in it.

206
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,149
And they're not for sale.

207
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,579
And as far as I'm concerned, you owe me.

208
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,159
For the past 14 years
I've sacrificed everything

209
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,200
to bring you up.
Aunt Cheryl!

210
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,640
You're the man of this house-

211
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,229
You're staying here, and that's it!

212
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,649
You're taking that job!

213
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,749
I'm gonna get that scholarship if I can!

214
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,039
I'm going away to school,
and no one's gonna stop me!

215
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,160
Not even you!

216
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,560
You upset me.

217
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,380
I'm gonna go upstairs and
lay down, cook your own meal!

218
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,349
I don't care.

219
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,650
Extra sugar, I can't
stand it, that's for you.

220
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
So afraid.

221
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,410
Chuck, I don't know why.

222
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,820
It's just a birthday.

223
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,000
One more and he'll be gone.

224
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,780
Something will happen.

225
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,910
He'll see I need him.

226
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,430
Billy?

227
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,130
Billy?

228
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Wake up.

229
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,849
Hi.
Good morning.

230
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,600
Happy Birthday

231
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,759
Thanks!

232
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,419
I thought after last night-

233
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,270
Sshh! Read the card.

234
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,539
"For my nephew on his birthday.

235
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,629
"Some extra special love."

236
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,129
"P.S., good luck with the scholarship."

237
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,130
Hey!

238
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,229
Took me some time to
understand it, that's all.

239
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,230
You're terrific.

240
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,980
You know what we both need?

241
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:11,110
Is a big cup of coffee, I'm exhausted.

242
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,889
Oh, before I forget,

243
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,009
stop by Brody's TV Repair
before school, will you?

244
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,639
We paid $38 to have the
set fixed and it still won't work.

245
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,459
Why can't you call him?

246
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,559
You know him.

247
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,139
Tell him I want him here this afternoon.

248
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,999
I have to go shopping this morning.

249
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,640
Buy someone a present.

250
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,599
I can't believe it!

251
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,439
A scout from the University of Denver,

252
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,289
from my school is coming here.

253
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,779
You didn't even tell me!

254
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,789
Well, that's why I was so long

255
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,389
with Coach Landers yesterday afternoon.

256
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,360
Oh!
There you go.

257
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,190
It's your birthday.

258
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:46,519
Oh, thanks.

259
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,379
So why didn't you tell me then?

260
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,659
Well, I wanted to run
it by Aunt Cheryl first.

261
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,660
Excuse, guys.

262
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,790
So what did Aunt Cheryl say?

263
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,019
How'd she take it?

264
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,470
Well, she's working it out.

265
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,380
It's too good to be true.

266
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:02,839
I feel like it's my birthday.

267
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,439
I haven't got the scholarship yet.

268
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,579
You will!

269
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
Oh, I forget.

270
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,490
Happy Birthday!

271
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,049
You're leaving now?

272
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,360
Yeah, I finished.

273
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,020
Don't go.

274
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,450
Lady, you got to be kidding me.

275
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,400
I'm gonna give you a.

276
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:55,340
Look Lady, I'm just not interested, okay?

277
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,600
I won't tell, I promise!

278
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,899
I can't believe this.

279
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,769
Please! I need a man!

280
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,929
Well, it's not gonna be me!

281
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,709
Please! I'll let you do
anything to me you want!

282
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,469
All right.

283
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,349
How 'bout you doing me?

284
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,420
Work on it.

285
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,700
You stupid bitch!

286
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,380
Cher, what?

287
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,300
What'd you do?

288
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,730
You saw him, he tried to rape me.

289
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,880
You saw him, you saw him!

290
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,789
He tried to rape me!

291
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,880
Billy, Billy!

292
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,540
You saw him, you saw him!

293
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,020
Frank, let me have the cake.

294
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:17,959
If I know you, you'll drop it.

295
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,800
Thanks.

296
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:20,269
I hope she likes it, it's a new recipe.

297
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,160
Oh, and Frank,

298
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:24,069
be sure to say something
about her pickled tomatoes.

299
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,120
They were terrible.

300
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,369
Frank, if you can't say something nice,

301
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,159
don't say anything.

302
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,309
I won't say anything.
Good!

303
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,279
Well, you think she
could put a porch light on,

304
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,110
you break your neck-
Give me your arm.

305
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:36,760
For crying out loud.

306
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,660
Where's the bell?

307
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,540
Just knock real loud.

308
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
Well where is everybody?

309
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,400
Cheryl, Billy! You-hoo!

310
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Hello?

311
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,349
Hello, hello?

312
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,350
Hello?

313
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Oh my God!

314
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Oh, Shit!

315
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,249
Okay to remove the body?

316
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,769
Yeah, go ahead.

317
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,080
You buy attempted rape?

318
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,909
No. Do you?

319
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,349
No.

320
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,650
It wasn't his day.

321
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,980
Poor guy didn't even get his pecker out.

322
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,040
Yeah. How are the twins?

323
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,879
They're fine, Joe.

324
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,089
You gonna have that operation?

325
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,040
What operation?

326
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,540
The snipping.
Hell, no.

327
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,289
Billy, how long had you been home

328
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,469
before they arrived?

329
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,009
We've already been through this.

330
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,840
Let's go through it again.

331
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,699
I already told you.

332
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,250
You gonna tell me again, son.

333
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,260
Well I came home just before they got here.

334
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,550
And then what?

335
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,430
Well, I was coming up the back stairs,

336
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,969
and I heard some voices in the kitchen.

337
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,520
So I looked through the window.

338
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,609
And then I seen this
guy hunch over my aunt.

339
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,960
So I went in to help her.
To help her.

340
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,109
That's very good, Billy.

341
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,950
That's exactly word-for-word
what you told me before.

342
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,199
Did she help you memorize all that?

343
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,569
No.
Did she?

344
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,499
C'mon tell me the truth, son! Did she?

345
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,109
You stupid bully, he's telling the truth!

346
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,229
Why you doing this to us!

347
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,189
Because there's a dead
man laying out there,

348
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,100
and I wanna know why he died.

349
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:55,580
I killed him! He tried to rape me!

350
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,610
If it's a hollering contest you want,

351
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,700
you're sure as shit gonna loose.

352
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,460
Be nice to me, lady.

353
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,690
He tried to rape.

354
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,549
I disagree.

355
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,859
There isn't a bruise on a you.

356
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,620
Your clothing hasn't been torn.

357
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,289
And these two walk in and find junior here

358
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,290
holding the knife.

359
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,950
It's interesting, folks.

360
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,140
Hold it, Cook.

361
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,399
Are you all right?

362
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,339
I don't know.

363
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,929
I feel kind of scared.

364
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,379
Honey, everything's gonna be all right.

365
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,770
No, don't!
Billy!

366
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,570
I just need some air.

367
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,039
Maybe you should go with him, Frank.

368
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,099
I don't think I better.

369
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,930
He's all right.

370
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:57,999
He's just disappointed.

371
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,859
He won't be able to go away now.

372
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,219
Hold it, Billy!

373
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,739
Where you going?

374
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,869
Outside on the porch.

375
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,269
Stick around.

376
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,270
Come back.

377
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,300
Did you, or your aunt, know Phil Brody?

378
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,989
Well yeah, he's been
here a couple of times.

379
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,419
We didn't know him.

380
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,250
You didn't know him?

381
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,250
But you knew him?

382
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,229
Turn around.

383
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,060
What?

384
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:22,150
Turn around!

385
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,850
Did you actually see Phil
Brody try to rape your aunt?

386
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,890
Yes!

387
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:37,499
I'm shy, I can't hear you.

388
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Yes.

389
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,740
Between you and me, Billy,

390
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
did you kill him?
No!
Right.
Miss Roberts!

391
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,909
Miss Roberts, would you come in here?

392
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,259
I wish he wouldn't yell.

393
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,999
You know, you don't
have to go through this,

394
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,349
you have your rights.

395
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,920
He's got to understand that I killed him.

396
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,209
Thank you, Miss Roberts.

397
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,529
I thought you were going outside.

398
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,820
I changed my mind.

399
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,180
You do make a lovely couple.

400
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,610
I wanna ask you a couple of questions.

401
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,440
Please have a seat.

402
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:28,790
May I have a seat? Thank you.

403
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,460
Now you said you weren't
married, is that correct?

404
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,899
Yes.

405
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
Are you divorced?

406
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,890
No.

407
00:23:37,891 --> 00:23:38,949
Widowed?

408
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,950
No.

409
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,100
But you do have boyfriends?

410
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,569
No.

411
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,529
Do you like girls, Miss Roberts?

412
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,339
God, you're a pig.

413
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,409
Just sick.

414
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,639
Why don't you stop tormenting her?

415
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,259
Are you talking to me, lady?

416
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,520
Yes.
Don't.

417
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,829
Billy, where are your parents?

418
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,830
They're dead.

419
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,990
Let the boy answer.

420
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,510
Well, my aunt's been taking
care of me since I was three.

421
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,340
Just the two of you in this big old house?

422
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,420
It must get awfully lonely.

423
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,560
No, we're good company for each other.

424
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:23,970
I bet you are.

425
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,880
You claim attempted rape.

426
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,670
I took at little peek
at this fellow, Brody.

427
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,909
It seems to me that
was fairly athletic fellow.

428
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,469
How come he didn't just
pin you down on the sofa?

429
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,850
He tried, but I got away.

430
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,859
Now you said he touched your booby.

431
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,409
What else did he do?

432
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,570
I refuse to answer any
more of your questions.

433
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,269
Lady, I don't give a shit what you do.

434
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,879
Lieutenant, I'm leaving now.

435
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,720
Then go ahead and leave, Cook.

436
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,610
Fascinating.

437
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,379
I thought you had practice this afternoon.

438
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,189
Well, we had a short session.

439
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,190
Oh.

440
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,599
Kind of warm for a fire, isn't it?

441
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,019
I'm cleaning out the attic.

442
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,939
This junk has been around here for years.

443
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,829
I thought I'd make you
a little apartment loft

444
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,819
out of that space upstairs for next year.

445
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,829
Well, I might be going away to-

446
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,679
You're gonna like it
when I finish, you'll see.

447
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,289
Don't go up there
until I tell you to, okay?

448
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,120
Well, what's wrong with-

449
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:24,459
Promise!

450
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,460
Sure.

451
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,769
Hey, by the way, did
Detective Carlson call today?

452
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,429
No, maybe he's forgot about us.

453
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,909
No, he was at school.

454
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,569
And he still wants me to
take the polygraph test.

455
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,119
I do not approve of you taking that test,

456
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,419
and I do not wanna discuss it again.

457
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,420
Is that clear?

458
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,880
Sure.

459
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,510
Shit!

460
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,649
Good Lord, what happened to you?

461
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,490
Are you all right?

462
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:17,549
I'm okay, I just tripped,

463
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,929
I'm all right, I'm all right.

464
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,739
Why are you only fully coordinated

465
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,940
on the basketball court?

466
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,339
You shouldn't had been up there anyway.

467
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,650
I know.

468
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,870
Who is that?

469
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,259
Who is that? What's the matter?

470
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,060
It's, just some twerp

471
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,700
your mother used to go out with.

472
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,860
Chuck Strang, his name was.

473
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,649
Clean all this stuff up for me, will 'ya?

474
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,650
Okay.

475
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,779
All right, John, take it up to basket,

476
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,429
take it up to the basket.

477
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,660
Ledge, why don't you save
that fancy stuff for EU, huh?

478
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,560
C'mon, Tony!

479
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:13,909
That's great, Tony, that's great.

480
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,840
You look real pretty,
the shot hit the goal.

481
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,809
Coach Lander?
Yeah?

482
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,399
I'm Detective Carlson,
I need to talk to you.

483
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,489
Yeah, we're in the middle of a drill,

484
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,839
can it wait for about five minutes?

485
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
No, it can't.

486
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,959
Is that Billy Lynch out there?

487
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,179
Yeah, that's Billy.

488
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,869
It's remarkable how tough today's youth is.

489
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,509
I mean, take Billy, just
a couple of days ago,

490
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,500
he witnessed a
particularly gruesome killing.

491
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,359
And take people in general.

492
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,570
I mean, there are people today

493
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,370
who loose a loved one,

494
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,989
and seem totally unfazed by it all.

495
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,440
I know it's your ring, Coach.

496
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,080
What is it?

497
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:58,140
Does it surprise you
much, if I had to make good?

498
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,949
I found this ring on Phil Brody.

499
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,100
The man who got killed.

500
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,459
Inside it says, "To P.B."

501
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,519
I take that to be Phil Brody.

502
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,989
"From T.L."

503
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,549
And I take that to be Tom Landers.

504
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,100
Yeah, that's you.
Yeah.

505
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,469
How does Billy fit into this?

506
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,459
Well it doesn't figure into this, Carlson.

507
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,360
I've coached the kid four years,

508
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:40,549
and I've watched him
become a real good ball player,

509
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,890
and I care about him.

510
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,470
I don't doubt that.

511
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,860
I suggest you resign.

512
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:52,130
If you don't, chances are you're
gonna get yourself lynched.

513
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,780
Yeah.

514
00:30:55,781 --> 00:30:57,070
You have a nice afternoon.

515
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,610
Hey, Carlson!

516
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,380
Hi!

517
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,870
I had to tear the wall down.

518
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,919
You're the only one I can talk to.

519
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,139
Billy's not going, I fixed it.

520
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,590
He's gonna stay here with us.

521
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,540
Everything's going so wrong.

522
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,630
I just wanted to show
Billy I needed his protection.

523
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,170
I didn't mean to kill that man.

524
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,240
But he hit me, he hurt me.

525
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,240
Just like you did.

526
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,560
Miss Roberts?

527
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

528
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,009
What the hell are you doing in here!

529
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,010
Easy, lady.

530
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,000
What do you think you're doing?

531
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:27,289
I, I, I knocked, nobody answered.

532
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,649
Do you have a search warrant?

533
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,809
I heard a noise, I just
thought something was wrong.

534
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,689
The only thing that's
wrong is you're in my house.

535
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,499
Now get out of here!

536
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,460
Now look- Get out!

537
00:33:35,461 --> 00:33:36,949
I just- Get out!

538
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,399
I just wanted to talk to you.

539
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,330
I don't wanna talk to you!

540
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,330
Now get out!

541
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,200
All right, all right.

542
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:42,920
Get out!

543
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,750
Hey Lynch! Did you hear
about your buddy, the Coach?

544
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,010
Yeah, Eddie.

545
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:54,840
Kind of interesting.

546
00:33:54,841 --> 00:33:56,279
Billy, ignore him.

547
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,130
You were always in Lander's office.

548
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,519
I always thought you guys were...

549
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,999
You know.

550
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,539
What?

551
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,589
Real close, Lynch.

552
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:10,060
I mean, real close.
Billy!

553
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,680
Oh, shit!

554
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Billy!

555
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:30,150
Billy!

556
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,410
Hit him hard! Hit him hard!

557
00:34:32,411 --> 00:34:33,830
Get him!

558
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,979
I'm gonna kick your ass, Eddie.

559
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,739
I'm gonna kick it!

560
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,080
Billy!

561
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,870
I'm gonna kill you, Eddie!

562
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,550
Let go of him!

563
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,420
I'm all right.

564
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,330
Yeah.

565
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,670
Nice shot.

566
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,090
That was a lucky shot.

567
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,480
You got technique, pal.

568
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,660
Damn good moves on the basket.

569
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,179
Coach Landers teach you those?

570
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,180
Yeah.

571
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,519
Doesn't it bother you that he's a fag?

572
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,679
C'mon.

573
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,029
Tell me, Billy, are you a fag?

574
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,439
No!

575
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,039
I'm gonna ask you again.

576
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,669
And keep it mind that it pisses me off

577
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,770
when people lie to me.

578
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,799
Are you a fag?

579
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
You're crazy.

580
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,539
Phil Brody, remember him?

581
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,940
The man who got wasted here?

582
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,989
Well he was a fag.

583
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,049
And it doesn't make a
whole hell of a lot of sense

584
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,300
for a fag to be raping
your aunt, now does it?

585
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,980
It does make sense if you are a fag, too.

586
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,720
Now I'm just postulating.

587
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:12,299
But I believe that you and Phil Brody

588
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,810
were having a lover's quarrel.

589
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,299
And the thing got a little out of hand.

590
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,719
And your aunt walked in and saw you

591
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,040
with a knife in your hand,
and decided to take the wrap.

592
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,559
Isn't that the way it happened, man?

593
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,970
You filthy pig!

594
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,799
You think you got it all
figured out, don't you?

595
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,300
Well, you're wrong!

596
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,010
Maybe.

597
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,060
You do that, Billy, so help me, God.

598
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,490
I'll break your arm.

599
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,320
On your outside jump, stay loose.

600
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,249
Helps.

601
00:36:55,250 --> 00:37:00,100
And your wrist, keep it limp, like.

602
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,490
That shouldn't be too difficult for you.

603
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,650
You know what they
don't teach you in school?

604
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,499
What?

605
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,850
How confusing and difficult
life can be sometimes.

606
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,059
You really don't understand, do you?

607
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,780
Billy, everything's gonna be all right.

608
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,979
It's not all right.

609
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,609
Carlson doesn't believe us.

610
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,339
He thinks he can prove I did it!

611
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,340
No, he can't.

612
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,089
We won't let him.

613
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,590
You're not making any sense.

614
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,540
Did you know that Coach
Landers was a homosexual?

615
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,390
No.

616
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,220
Billy?

617
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:31,529
No!

618
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,559
Do you know that
homosexuals are very, very sick?

619
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,919
Do you know that, Billy?

620
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,630
Coach Landers is not sick!

621
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,430
Billy! Billy!

622
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,410
Hey, Billy.
Yeah?

623
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,779
Aren't you gonna say hello?

624
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,030
Don't you mean goodbye?

625
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,559
I heard you quit.

626
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,859
Why you leaving?

627
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,919
Look, this is something that

628
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,699
I'm gonna have to fight in my own way.

629
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,000
And I just didn't wanna
be here when I did it.

630
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,440
Carlson came over yesterday.

631
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,649
He told my aunt you were gay.

632
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,300
Don't you worry about it, okay?

633
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,780
I know.

634
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,650
You know what?

635
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,719
He also says he can
prove that I killed Brody.

636
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,819
Look, don't let it worry you, all right?

637
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,689
I'll go check it out.

638
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,009
And man, listen, if there's
anything that I can do,

639
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,279
all right, you call me?

640
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,089
Sure, Coach.
Any time.

641
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,399
Yeah.

642
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,659
Take care, partner.

643
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,669
You, too. Take it easy.

644
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,920
See 'ya, Bill.

645
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,809
Rapes are 18%.

646
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,589
What the hell are you
people doing out there?

647
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,639
Child molestation is up 3%.

648
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,329
I want all these fucking
deviants off the street. Pronto?

649
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,559
Y'all got that?

650
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,899
What are you doing here, Nancy?

651
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,730
Fuck you!

652
00:39:47,731 --> 00:39:48,980
And fuck you!

653
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,549
God-damn hookers.

654
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,930
All right, I don't want anything.

655
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,460
That's right, it's just
you and me, ain't it?

656
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,660
Here, you want a cookie?

657
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,139
Landers, I was just talking about you.

658
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,140
Yeah.

659
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,579
Billy Green.

660
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,870
Does the name ring a bell?

661
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,549
No?

662
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,660
One of two young boys molested last night.

663
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,659
I figured you might know
something about that.

664
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,830
Well, it was just a thought.

665
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,280
I understand you resigned. Smart move.

666
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,570
Good for everyone.

667
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,170
What do you want?

668
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,959
I forgot to tell you something, Carlson.

669
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,119
What?

670
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,419
Phil Brody used to be married.

671
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,179
That means that Cheryl Robert's story

672
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,889
might possibly be true.

673
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,110
Why you telling me this?

674
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,489
I thought it might help you.

675
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:59,050
Help me?

676
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,760
Or help your phat boy, Billy.

677
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,819
Carlson, what's your problem?

678
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,820
People like you.

679
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,600
Get the fuck out of my office.

680
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,910
Deviant, Mackie, you know what that is?

681
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,319
Fucking deviant.

682
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,019
The world is full of 'em.

683
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,099
Oh hey, I'm sorry about the
last couple days, you know?

684
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,409
I mean, it's been pretty rough.

685
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:37,019
But you gotta let me work it out on my own.

686
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,720
Well, are you?
No.

687
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,919
But you're sure you don't wanna be helped.

688
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,659
Everything's so screwed up.

689
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,579
Do you wanna talk about it?

690
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,300
No, not here.

691
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,629
What are you doing tonight?

692
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,059
What about Aunt Cheryl?

693
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,319
Oh, she's going to Sedona
with Margie and Frank.

694
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,770
She won't be home till later.

695
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
It's about time.

696
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,969
Thunder, calm down.

697
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,189
I'm fine. Mother!

698
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,860
Would you call Thunder upstairs?

699
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,469
Sorry.

700
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,139
Okay, I like dogs like that.

701
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,970
Can I help you?

702
00:42:17,971 --> 00:42:19,659
Are you Julie Linden?

703
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,490
Mm-hmm.

704
00:42:20,491 --> 00:42:21,509
I'm Lieutenant Carlson.

705
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,120
I need to talk with you.

706
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,930
It's kind of private,

707
00:42:26,931 --> 00:42:29,189
do you mind taking a walk with me?

708
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:32,020
Okay.
Thank you, thank you.

709
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,060
How long have you and
Billy been going steady?

710
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,709
About a year.

711
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,710
Is it serious?

712
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,580
It is to me.

713
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,129
He's very special.

714
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,820
Well he certainly has had
an unusual background.

715
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,719
Do you find his relationship

716
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,710
with Aunt Cheryl a bit peculiar?

717
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,759
I guess, I don't know.

718
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,199
How's Billy with you?

719
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,639
I mean, is he strong,

720
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,419
aggressive, kind of?

721
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,079
Lieutenant, you seem to
have something on your mind.

722
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,550
I'd like to know what it is.

723
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,499
I need to know if you two are making it.

724
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,519
That's none of your business!

725
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,520
A man got killed.

726
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:24,769
Supposedly by a woman
who's claiming attempted rape.

727
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,820
The man was a homosexual,
an acquaintance of Billy.

728
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,109
I have a responsibility to find out

729
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,759
whether or not Aunt
Cheryl is covering for Billy.

730
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,860
And whether or not he's a homosexual, too.

731
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,370
That's ridiculous!

732
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,510
So tell me, are you two making it?

733
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,900
I'm not going to answer that.

734
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,800
Julie?

735
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,100
I think you just did.

736
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,570
He's more of a man than you'll ever be.

737
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,299
Humph,

738
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,410
okay.

739
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,819
Hey, you want something to drink?

740
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,820
Sure.

741
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,220
I'm on my way.

742
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,480
Hurry back, okay?
Okay.

743
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,940
This house gives me the creeps.

744
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,090
Billy, I didn't wanna tell you this,

745
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,710
but I don't feel right
keeping it from you, either.

746
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,500
What is it? More bad news?

747
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,600
Not bad news, exactly.

748
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,639
That Detective Carlson came by my house,

749
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,340
and he asked me some questions.

750
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,370
Like what?

751
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,349
General stuff, mostly.

752
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,470
And he asked me, how many,

753
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,180
how often we make love.

754
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:19,209
What did you tell him?

755
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,549
That it was none of his business.

756
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:22,550
Good.

757
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,650
How come we haven't more often?

758
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,020
Billy, is there something wrong?

759
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,049
Something you wanna tell me?

760
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,050
No.

761
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,040
Yeah.

762
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,719
You have a terrific body, you know that?

763
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,720
You really do.

764
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,210
And you're really sexy.

765
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,740
Billy!

766
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,090
You get dressed and
get that slut out of here!

767
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

768
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,460
Sergeant Cook, homicide.

769
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,689
Oh Jesus, you scared me!

770
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,690
I'm sorry.

771
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,599
What are you doing here?

772
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,759
Well, actually, I came to ask
Miss Roberts some questions,

773
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,849
but I'd like to talk to
you, if you don't mind.

774
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:21,059
Did she catch 'ya?

775
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,519
You might say that.

776
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,029
Well that's good.

777
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,610
That's good for Billy's case.

778
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,479
You see there's kind of
a strong feeling that he's-

779
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,789
I know.

780
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,040
Are you finished?

781
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,399
Yeah.

782
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,400
So am I.

783
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,380
Okay.

784
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:42,520
Billy, I wanna talk to you!

785
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:43,809
Well, I don't! Okay!

786
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:44,690
Billy!

787
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:45,520
Do you mind!

788
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,370
I want you to promise me

789
00:48:46,371 --> 00:48:47,599
that you will never do that again!

790
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,600
Hand me a towel.

791
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,759
Jesus, Aunt Cheryl, I'm 17 years old!

792
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,299
And it's not the end of the world!

793
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,509
I want you to listen to me!

794
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,350
No!

795
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,350
Do you promise?

796
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,539
Okay.

797
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,620
That's a good boy.

798
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,100
God!

799
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:17,139
Perverts and sluts!

800
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,849
They're doing everything they
can to take him away from us.

801
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:22,300
Did you know that he's
still thinking of leaving?

802
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,029
Sure you did.

803
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,899
You know everything, don't 'ya?

804
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,739
But he won't, 'cause
I'm gonna keep him here.

805
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,560
The same way I kept you here.

806
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,010
He'll never leave us.

807
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,390
Cook, walk with me.

808
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,979
Julie Linden's mother called

809
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,059
and complained about you

810
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,209
scaring the shit out of her daughter.

811
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:49,729
What were you doing out there?

812
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,049
Well, I was just checking.

813
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:52,579
See, I don't think that Billy Lynch

814
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,039
had anything to do with the murder.

815
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,569
I kind of see it different.

816
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:56,560
Oh, is that right?

817
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:58,149
And how is that?

818
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:59,249
Well for one thing,

819
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:03,399
Miss Roberts caught Julie
and the boy in the sack together.

820
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,200
That kind of weakens the fag theory.

821
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,429
The victim was a fag.

822
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:12,999
The coach is a fag.

823
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,130
And the kid is a fag.

824
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,110
He grew up without a father,
with only women around.

825
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,520
It's a classic case, Cook.

826
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,149
All right, all right.

827
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,049
There's something else.

828
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:27,899
This is from the "Flagstaff Courier",

829
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,889
September 12, 1967.

830
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:34,329
Bill and Ann Lynch, the boy's parents,

831
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:37,369
were killed yesterday outside Flagstaff

832
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:39,769
when their car crashed into a logging truck

833
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,039
on Interstate 89.

834
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,600
The cause is thought to
have been brake failure.

835
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,179
Now I talked to a few of the locals,

836
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,869
and they remembered that there were rumors

837
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,720
about the brakes being tampered with.

838
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:54,010
Cook,

839
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,859
I hope you're doing this
shit on your own time.

840
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:04,150
Because I forbid from
doing it on department time.

841
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,260
Incredible.

842
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,460
Schmuck.

843
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:46,650
Billy, can I talk to you?

844
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,459
Is it important? I'm in a hurry.

845
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,099
It's very important.

846
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,199
Billy, please?

847
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,200
Come sit down.

848
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,839
I thought you'd like a glass of milk,

849
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,790
some of your favorite chocolate
chip cookies for good luck.

850
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:03,890
I mean it, Billy.

851
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,859
I know how important tonight is for you.

852
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,569
I want you to know that if
you get that scholarship,

853
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,030
I'm behind you, 100%.

854
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,560
Good luck tonight, Billy.

855
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:25,729
I know you're in a hurry,
take these with you.

856
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:27,519
Mm, thanks.

857
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,929
Go get 'em. I'll be there.

858
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,130
See you later.
Bye!

859
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,279
Good luck!

860
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,120
Thanks!

861
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:55,079
The scout from Denver's
here, I know you'll get it.

862
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,479
I hope so.

863
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,059
I'm feeling kind of dizzy,

864
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,009
but it's a hell of a time to
come down with something.

865
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,930
Don't worry, you'll be all right!

866
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,910
This way, it's a point shot, all right?

867
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,229
You got hit.

868
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:49,609
You sure? All right.

869
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:50,729
Take it easy, all right.

870
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:51,560
Take your time.

871
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,390
Take it easy.

872
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:54,110
I'm okay, okay, okay.

873
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,400
Billy!

874
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:08,100
Billy, honey, honey.

875
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:10,290
Honey?

876
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,450
We're going home.

877
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:33,750
Hello, there! Welcome back!

878
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:37,830
You've been sleeping
on and off for 14 hours.

879
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:40,910
Where am I?

880
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:41,740
Remember I told you

881
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:44,619
the attic could make a
nice little apartment for you?

882
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,870
Well, you like?

883
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,409
I guess so.

884
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,690
I knew you'd be thrilled.

885
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,170
What happened at the game?

886
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,540
Honey, you slipped, or something.

887
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,239
You had a nasty fall.

888
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,000
You hit your head hard.

889
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:06,359
What time is it?

890
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,360
Noon.

891
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,149
Oh my God.

892
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:10,709
Where do you think you're going, young man?

893
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:12,099
School.

894
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,350
I promised I'd meet Julie by one o'clock.

895
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,679
Did anybody call?

896
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,479
No, no one called.

897
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,909
You stay right here.

898
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:21,759
You don't wanna go
back there anyway, Billy.

899
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,099
You learned enough.

900
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,719
Besides, it's full of perverts.

901
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,379
You stay here with
me, I'll teach you things.

902
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,770
Oh, look what I found
when I was cleaning up.

903
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:36,390
Look.

904
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:43,320
Your father gave this to your
mother when they got married.

905
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:46,040
I don't, you-

906
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:47,589
She had it on when she died.

907
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,869
No!

908
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:53,010
All right. I'll put it in here for you.

909
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,360
Hungry?

910
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:59,039
Sort of.

911
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,049
Why don't I come down?

912
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:03,459
You stay right there, you need your rest.

913
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,589
I'll bring you something up.

914
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,179
You can get washed if you want to.

915
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:09,180
Whoop!

916
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:11,560
You're so cute.

917
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,629
"Dear Cheryl,

918
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:05,209
"even though we've only
know each other for two weeks,"

919
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:09,630
"I know this is the start of
something very special-"

920
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:17,459
What do you think you're doing?

921
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,450
Nothing.

922
01:00:18,451 --> 01:00:19,539
I'm just looking.

923
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,739
You're lying!

924
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:24,579
You're going through my private belongings.

925
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,490
That's very rude!

926
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:27,289
I don't want you to ever do that again!

927
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,489
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

928
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:30,829
About what?

929
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:33,380
Chuck Strang was your
boyfriend, not my mother's!

930
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,859
Honey!

931
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:41,060
Phil Brody didn't try to rape you, did he?

932
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,509
Billy!

933
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:44,689
He did!

934
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:45,879
You know he did.

935
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,880
You saw it!

936
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,000
Aunt Cheryl, there's something wrong.

937
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:53,429
You're lying to me.

938
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:56,430
Why would I ever wanna lie to you?

939
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:00,540
Lock her up.

940
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:03,200
Sit down.

941
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:04,229
Donde?

942
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:05,529
Ay, yah.

943
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,030
Sit down on the fucking floor.

944
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,109
Donde es su casa?

945
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,020
Aqui.

946
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,020
Bullshit!

947
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:21,269
Donde es su casa en Mexico?

948
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:22,670
Joe?
What?

949
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,270
I got some more information
on Cheryl Roberts.

950
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,879
Could you do me a favor
and keep it to yourself?

951
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,659
The more I find out about that woman,

952
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:33,699
the stranger she gets.

953
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,629
She dated a guy in high
school named Chuck Strang.

954
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:39,579
An older guy, not a local.

955
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,699
One day he just disappeared.

956
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,959
Left his clothes and everything.

957
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,999
Hasn't been heard of since.

958
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,150
You look tired, Cook.

959
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:49,359
You need some rest.

960
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,609
Go on home.

961
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:51,440
As a matter of fact,

962
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,570
I don't even mind if you go on vacation!

963
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:17,990
That's better.

964
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:09,880
Stop it, you! You're always teasing me.

965
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,030
I know, I cut it off.

966
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,070
You made me!

967
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,800
You're happy, aren't you?

968
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,069
Just you and me, and Billy.

969
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:32,970
No one's every gonna take him from us.

970
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:37,380
I feel so good.

971
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,240
Don't you?

972
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:52,379
You gotta help me.

973
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,089
She hates me, she won't talk to me.

974
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,749
Well yeah, she will.

975
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:56,779
If you go up to the house,

976
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:58,579
you can distract her for a few minutes,

977
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:01,329
then I can find out
what's in that jewelry box.

978
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:02,490
Okay.

979
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,950
Miss Roberts?

980
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,020
Miss Roberts?

981
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Miss Roberts?
What are you doing in here!

982
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:51,249
I told you that Billy is
under doctor's orders to rest!

983
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:52,829
I know, I didn't come to see him.

984
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,369
I came to apologize.

985
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:56,379
I don't want any apologies from you!

986
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:59,459
I am inviting you to get out of here!

987
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,729
No! Not until I said what I came to say!

988
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:04,180
You can talk till you're blue in the face.

989
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:07,840
I saw you the other night.

990
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,080
I know what you do.

991
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,960
I hope you're not gonna
make me throw you out of here.

992
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:42,639
Miss Roberts, I just wish
you could understand.

993
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,100
Billy and I really love each other.

994
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:58,229
I still think of Billy as my little baby.

995
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:01,109
Everything moved so fast.

996
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:05,440
Yesterday's become
tomorrow's before you even blink.

997
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:07,940
I do understand.

998
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:11,630
I had a boyfriend once.

999
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,080
I do understand, Honey!

1000
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,320
C'mere.

1001
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:24,550
Oh, Honey.

1002
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,439
I have another round
sitting in the refrigerator.

1003
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,539
Honey, could you get it for me?

1004
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,370
Sure.

1005
01:06:35,371 --> 01:06:36,389
Oh, you're so caring.

1006
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:39,690
Thank you.

1007
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:17,050
Hello, hello! It's me, Margie!

1008
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:24,940
Hello?

1009
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,210
Cheryl?

1010
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:43,730
Hi, Margie.

1011
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:47,089
Oh, hi!

1012
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:48,539
What?

1013
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:51,029
Your hair! What did you do?

1014
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:51,960
You like?

1015
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:52,790
Yeah.

1016
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:53,989
I did it myself.

1017
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:55,409
I think it makes me look younger.

1018
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:57,859
Oh, definitely, yes.

1019
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,099
Oh yeah, I love it.

1020
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:01,530
It's different.
Thanks.

1021
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,149
Hi, Margie. Hi, Cheryl.

1022
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:05,980
Hi, Billy.

1023
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:07,679
Billy! I thought you were upstairs!

1024
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,959
Where have you've been?

1025
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,279
Didn't you get my note?

1026
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,280
No.

1027
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,340
Well, I had to go to Julie's
house to give her books.

1028
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:19,779
Her mother said she was coming over here.

1029
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:20,780
Well, did she come?

1030
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:25,160
Well, didn't she?

1031
01:08:25,161 --> 01:08:27,889
No, she came by, she had to leave.

1032
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:28,850
She said she'd call you later.

1033
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:29,869
Here you go.

1034
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:31,880
Doctor says he's gotta have lots of milk.

1035
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:34,589
Cheryl, what'd you do to your hair?

1036
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:35,420
Don't you just love it?

1037
01:08:35,421 --> 01:08:37,260
Why, it's the latest thing.

1038
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:41,119
I brought you some of my
homemade cheesecake.

1039
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,039
And look, some new sports magazines.

1040
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:43,870
Basketball.

1041
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:46,149
Oh sit down, Billy, we'll all have some.

1042
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:47,379
You know, some one was out of work

1043
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,699
at Frank's office for three weeks!

1044
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,640
Isn't this fun? It's like having a party.

1045
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:55,460
And then my sick boy is
going straight upstairs to bed.

1046
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,229
You really should take
care of yourself, Billy.

1047
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:03,639
Maybe I should've brought
my chicken soup instead.

1048
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,699
The doctor said the only way

1049
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,880
to get rid of it is plenty of sleep.

1050
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:10,050
Billy!
Billy!

1051
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,260
Oh, he's coming out of it.

1052
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:35,979
Hi, Honey. Don't talk.

1053
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,709
I still say you should call a doctor.

1054
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:39,539
Margie, you have said that 10 times now,

1055
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:40,540
he'll be fine, thank you.

1056
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:41,809
Why don't you go home?

1057
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:43,580
I don't need you any more.

1058
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:45,569
I see.

1059
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:47,559
Well, obviously you know what you're doing.

1060
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,879
I just wanted to be of some help.

1061
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,530
But if don't want me- I don't!

1062
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:53,960
All right.

1063
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:01,480
She seems to think

1064
01:10:01,481 --> 01:10:04,019
I need help taking care of you.

1065
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:06,059
Oh, the reason that I
brought you into this room,

1066
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,860
is that I didn't want her to
know about our little room.

1067
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,000
You, Ma-

1068
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:17,320
Save your strength,
Honey; Save your strength.

1069
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:23,940
Oh.

1070
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,300
The note.

1071
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,580
I'm your mother.

1072
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,759
Chuck.

1073
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,860
Chuck's your father.

1074
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,690
He was gonna leave me.

1075
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,380
Just like you were gonna leave me.

1076
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:53,479
He said he didn't love me.

1077
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,419
Wasn't going to marry me.

1078
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:58,479
So my sister and her husband adopted you.

1079
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,730
But then I wanted you back.

1080
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:05,009
So I had-

1081
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,180
Be right back.

1082
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:27,580
Hello?

1083
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:30,030
No.

1084
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,710
No, I haven't seen her all day.

1085
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:37,720
Mrs. Linden, if Julie was
here, I would of seen her.

1086
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:40,810
To the airport?

1087
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,799
Why don't you take a cab?

1088
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,079
I don't really care.

1089
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,769
No, you cannot talk to him, he's very sick.

1090
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:52,180
Yeah, I'll tell her, if I see her.

1091
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,720
I thought you told Billy
that Julie had been here.

1092
01:11:58,210 --> 01:11:59,399
Do you always listen on

1093
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,270
other people's phone conversations?

1094
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:05,979
I wasn't listening, I was-

1095
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,380
What are you doing here?

1096
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:09,440
I closed your windows.

1097
01:12:09,441 --> 01:12:11,310
It looks like it's gonna rain.

1098
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,970
You better go, Margie.

1099
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:26,739
Do you mind if I use
your phone to call Frank?

1100
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:29,119
I don't wanna get caught in the rain.

1101
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,370
There's an umbrella in the broom closet!

1102
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,050
You better use it.

1103
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:39,870
Then go.

1104
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:44,239
Would you hold, please?

1105
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,679
Just one second.

1106
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,479
Julie Linden's mother.

1107
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,400
I don't wanna talk to her.

1108
01:12:48,401 --> 01:12:50,150
I already told her you were here.

1109
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Thanks.

1110
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,449
Hello, Miss Linden?

1111
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:59,010
Look, I'm sorry about...

1112
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,760
What time was she supposed to pick you up?

1113
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,800
I see.

1114
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:14,270
I think Miss Roberts is
kind of peculiar myself.

1115
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:17,960
Well maybe I should just
stop by and take a look.

1116
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,160
Bye-bye.

1117
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:22,729
What's wrong?

1118
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:25,240
Is Westcott working the Injun Road area?

1119
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:27,030
Yes.

1120
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:28,020
I'm going out there.

1121
01:13:28,021 --> 01:13:30,209
Tell him to stop by the Robert's place,

1122
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:31,720
and tell Carlson where I am.

1123
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:02,219
Little boy Billy all dressed in blue

1124
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,059
I love you

1125
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,309
Yes I do

1126
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:11,310
Little boy Billy with eyes so brown

1127
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:16,240
Come to me, come lie down

1128
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:20,219
I found the umbrella.

1129
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,220
I'm leaving now.

1130
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,430
Little boy, Billy.

1131
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,629
You will drink it!

1132
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:36,460
Drink it!

1133
01:14:36,461 --> 01:14:37,570
I spoke to Chuck about you.

1134
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:41,290
It's all your fault. He agrees!

1135
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:51,900
Drink the rest of this.

1136
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,810
What a little messy baby.

1137
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:08,260
I'll be back.

1138
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:16,610
It's time to go to bed.

1139
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,180
I'll be downstairs.

1140
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1141
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,390
Cheryl! No!

1142
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:53,210
Julie!
No!

1143
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:15,710
Come here, slut.

1144
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,060
Here, slut.

1145
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,480
No!

1146
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:26,000
My God!

1147
01:23:19,470 --> 01:23:21,669
Who are you talking to?
No one.

1148
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:22,710
Girlfriend?

1149
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:27,680
Forget it.

1150
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:35,190
I'm your girlfriend now.

1151
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:37,910
Honey.

1152
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:39,570
I won't go.

1153
01:23:39,571 --> 01:23:40,869
Oh, I know you won't go.

1154
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:41,700
I promise.

1155
01:23:41,701 --> 01:23:43,399
I know you won't go.

1156
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,009
Chuck planned to go.

1157
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:47,979
I put him down there where he belongs.

1158
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:49,699
He's with me forever.

1159
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:50,700
But a rotten sister.

1160
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:53,929
She tried to take you away from me.

1161
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:55,819
I took care of her, too.

1162
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:58,669
Don't ever make me do that to you.

1163
01:23:58,670 --> 01:23:59,590
You promise?

1164
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:00,420
I promise.

1165
01:24:00,421 --> 01:24:01,669
You promise?

1166
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:04,639
You little lying shit!

1167
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,539
You're a lying bastard!

1168
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:07,620
You're lying!

1169
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:17,110
You lying bastard! You lying bastard!

1170
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:10,200
Hello?

1171
01:25:10,201 --> 01:25:12,240
Hello? Coach Landers?

1172
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,750
All right, this is Billy Lynch.

1173
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:17,279
You all right?

1174
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,280
I need your help.

1175
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:20,940
My mother's dead.

1176
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:23,170
Whoa, wait, your mother,

1177
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:24,140
what are you talking about?

1178
01:25:24,141 --> 01:25:26,939
My mother's dead, I just killed her.

1179
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
All right, hold on, I'll be right there.
I killed my mother.

1180
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:12,440
Mother!

1181
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:21,590
Mother, Mother.

1182
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:41,510
One is dead, Lieutenant.

1183
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:51,590
You've seen Cook?

1184
01:26:51,591 --> 01:26:52,810
Yeah, he's dead.

1185
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,560
Captain, I'm going in there.

1186
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:15,789
Don't hold your breath, Billy.

1187
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:18,829
Don't, just keep breathing.

1188
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:20,529
You keep breathing.

1189
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:22,799
There's nothing pumping
down there, there's nothing.

1190
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,119
Ow!

1191
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:26,759
Get your hand away from it.

1192
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,300
You'll be all right.

1193
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:34,599
Get away from there!

1194
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,600
Back up.

1195
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,449
Well, you really did it, Billy.

1196
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:40,450
Hey, Lieutenant!

1197
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:43,010
Oh, God!

1198
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:46,119
Julie!

1199
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,439
Which of you two assholes killed Cook?

1200
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:49,679
No!

1201
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:52,639
It was her. She killed him.

1202
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,140
Look in the basement.

1203
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:57,039
Get on the radio and get
her some medical attention.

1204
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,459
Right away!

1205
01:27:58,460 --> 01:27:59,430
Shouldn't I check the basement?

1206
01:27:59,431 --> 01:28:02,219
She saw Miss Roberts kill Cook.

1207
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:03,609
Carlson, the girl said-

1208
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:04,989
I don't care what she says!

1209
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:05,870
Get home!

1210
01:28:05,871 --> 01:28:10,570
No! No!

1211
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:17,459
You son of a bitch!

1212
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:18,460
Yeah!

1213
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:27,460
Okay, Billy, here you go.

1214
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:40,900
Not there!

1215
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:50,589
Drop the gun, give me the gun.

1216
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:51,730
Give me the gun!

1217
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,610
C'mon, give me the gun!

1218
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:02,090
Billy, give me the gun.

1219
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,509
You're not gonna shoot nobody.

1220
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:07,899
C'mon, give me the gun.

1221
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:09,099
Give me the gun, Billy!

1222
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:11,050
C'mon, give it to me!

1223
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:51,709
Oh shit, drop it.

1224
01:29:51,710 --> 01:29:52,820
Billy!

1225
01:29:57,330 --> 01:29:58,630
Oh, Billy.

1226
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:07,690
Julie.

1227
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:14,760
Billy.

1228
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:17,460
Billy.

1229
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:21,060
Billy.
