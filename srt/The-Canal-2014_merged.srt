187
00:17:56,485 --> 00:17:57,693
Goodbye child.

188
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:00,190
Goodbye mom.

189
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:01,813
Wait till your dad, Billy!

190
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:07,473
Hey, do not work late tonight.

191
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:10,345
- Come straight home.
- Why?

192
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:11,969
What?

193
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,339
It will not be too late, I promise.

194
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:21,251
Goodbye.

195
00:19:13,573 --> 00:19:14,654
Alice!

196
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,900
Alice!

197
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:33,028
Hello?

198
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:35,967
<i>Dad! I'm still in school
, will you come for me</i>

199
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,921
Dad, did you forget me?

200
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,253
I just lost track of time.

201
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,270
Sorry.

202
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:44,916
Adam and I were the only ones left
.

203
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:52,450
Adam said a Gowilla could beat
one Winosaurus in a fight, is it true?

204
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:53,782
No.

205
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:47,374
<i>The master wants you</i>

206
00:23:50,622 --> 00:23:53,119
<i>The master wants you</i>

207
00:24:13,614 --> 00:24:14,614
<i>David...</i>

208
00:24:14,638 --> 00:24:16,719
<i>want you to listen...</i>

209
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:18,552
<i>forgive me... No, God...</i>

210
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,050
<i>I do not want...</i>

211
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:24,213
<i>David please...</i>

212
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:27,542
<i>Please... No, no...</i>

213
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:29,791
<i>do not</i>

214
00:24:30,124 --> 00:24:32,537
<i>I do not want to die</i>

215
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:44,172
<i>Hi, I'm Alice here, so sorry if I
I missed your call</i>

216
00:25:44,214 --> 00:25:45,670
<i>If you want to leave your name and number
I'll be in...</i>

217
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:48,112
<i>contact you as soon as I
possible. Thank you</i>

218
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:12,936
Detective McNamara.

219
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,085
So, when I saw him last?

220
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:30,131
Eh... Yesterday morning.

221
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:32,828
We said goodbye, do
Billy, my son, to school.

222
00:26:33,704 --> 00:26:35,536
And she has been out all night
before?

223
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:36,744
No.

224
00:26:36,785 --> 00:26:37,949
No, never.

225
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:40,906
Said he'd be working until
late last night, but I asked a...

226
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:42,570
coworker of Hersand and said...

227
00:26:42,612 --> 00:26:44,292
Alice was about five.

228
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,858
Did you have an argument?

229
00:26:46,876 --> 00:26:47,876
No.

230
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,106
Are you sure?

231
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,274
Yes

232
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:53,393
Have you been in touch
with family and friends?

233
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:54,225
Yes

234
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:55,557
And have not heard of it?

235
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:56,723
No.

236
00:27:04,797 --> 00:27:05,881
Okay...

237
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:08,669
Hair Color?

238
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:20,846
Some of them are a bit old.

239
00:27:21,113 --> 00:27:22,633
That's all I could find.

240
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,043
Dad...

241
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:28,358
returns when mommy?

242
00:27:30,562 --> 00:27:33,061
I told you... will be in
home soon. Do not worry.

243
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:42,177
Pretty...

244
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:19,679
- Hello.
- Hi.

245
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:25,299
Is there any news?

246
00:28:28,879 --> 00:28:30,127
How is Billy?

247
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,917
Yeah, okay.

248
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:34,102
I got to bed an hour ago.

249
00:28:34,137 --> 00:28:36,245
He wanted to sleep in her room.

250
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,991
You know there's something black in his hands?

251
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:44,281
They took my fingerprints digital to eliminate me.

252
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:46,985
In case there is an inquiry.

253
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:56,016
Eh... I stuck
Billy in bed an hour ago.

254
00:28:56,057 --> 00:28:57,418
He wanted to sleep in her room.

255
00:28:57,431 --> 00:29:01,720
He's fine. All day.
We get along great!

256
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,258
He's a great guy, I really sympathize
.

257
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,630
Get to know everything about dinosaurs!

258
00:29:06,671 --> 00:29:07,838
I know, yes!

259
00:29:10,336 --> 00:29:11,460
Me I better go.

260
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:12,585
Yes

261
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:14,622
Thanks.

262
00:29:14,663 --> 00:29:15,663
Yes

263
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:16,746
See you in the morning.

264
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,830
Si.

265
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:11,481
Billy... Billy! What are you looking at?

266
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,146
Come here...

267
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:19,098
I had a dream about Mommy.

268
00:30:19,141 --> 00:30:20,141
I miss.

269
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:01,514
A man came yesterday saying
be the lover of his wife.

270
00:31:04,344 --> 00:31:06,966
Says
was with her the night she disappeared.

271
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:12,917
They have been going out together for a year.

272
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,206
Do you know anything about that?

273
00:31:17,912 --> 00:31:18,912
No.

274
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:26,029
Well, according to him,
was planning to leave.

275
00:31:26,071 --> 00:31:27,487
That's impossible.

276
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:28,527
She loves me.

277
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:30,359
Has a lover, David.

278
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
He's lying!

279
00:31:32,606 --> 00:31:35,479
Well, several of its
friends have supported him.

280
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:40,806
In what counts, was
love with the guy, and he with her.

281
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:52,752
Sorry.

282
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:56,914
Cursed acid reflux.

283
00:32:00,243 --> 00:32:02,158
Total fucking pain in the ass.

284
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:05,823
Want one of these?

285
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:07,613
No.

286
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:12,523
I have a very weak stomach, David.

287
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:20,764
Not kill her, right?

288
00:32:20,932 --> 00:32:23,346
No right to be
wondering these things.

289
00:32:25,261 --> 00:32:29,006
I love, love my wife.

290
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,670
Never
I never do anything to hurt her.

291
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:36,126
Never.

292
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:41,078
Le asking your lover
these questions, right?

293
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,827
Yes

294
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:43,200
Do you ask him if he killed her?

295
00:32:43,242 --> 00:32:44,574
Yes

296
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:47,570
He has an alibi.

297
00:32:47,611 --> 00:32:50,901
Your boss called right as he left his house,

298
00:32:51,151 --> 00:32:53,939
listened both insisting on going home alone...

299
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:56,227
and then the phone went on
for...

300
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:58,518
Over an hour, so
that is solid, man!

301
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,257
People always suspect the husband.

302
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,546
Do you know why that is?

303
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:14,792
Because it's always the husband.

304
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:17,707
Every damn time.

305
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:52,193
Is this your wife?

306
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:55,439
Is this your wife, Alice Williams?

307
00:34:59,728 --> 00:35:00,934
Yes

308
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:02,891
Yes, it's my wife.

309
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,009
There was no evidence of foul play or assault
.

310
00:35:10,134 --> 00:35:11,922
Drowned.

311
00:35:13,006 --> 00:35:14,629
Must have been dropped.

312
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,541
Was it an accident?

313
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,748
Yes

314
00:35:20,247 --> 00:35:21,871
Think so.

315
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,075
One of the heel of his shoe party
it would,

316
00:35:25,117 --> 00:35:27,449
That we think could have caused his downfall.

317
00:35:27,656 --> 00:35:31,403
So, the absence of any evidence to the contrary
,

318
00:35:32,152 --> 00:35:35,732
we have to conclude that it was an accident
yes.

319
00:35:37,106 --> 00:35:38,520
Do you agree?

320
00:35:40,436 --> 00:35:42,890
Did you know she was pregnant?

321
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:11,030
<i>

322
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:12,734

Sorry for your loss.

326
00:36:27,513 --> 00:36:29,760
Thanks.

327
00:36:32,883 --> 00:36:34,088
Nana.

328
00:36:43,121 --> 00:36:44,661
She loved you.

329
00:36:45,827 --> 00:36:49,364
You knew, right?

330
00:36:49,405 --> 00:36:50,613
Yes?

331
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,030
She loved you.

332
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:56,564
More than any other thing in the world.

333
00:36:56,899 --> 00:36:57,899
Yes

334
00:36:59,147 --> 00:37:00,644
Oh Billy!

335
00:37:03,808 --> 00:37:04,974
Billy.

336
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,180
Come, go with Clare, okay?

337
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,253
How are you?

338
00:37:18,126 --> 00:37:19,208
Yeah, okay.

339
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,164
Children are strong.

340
00:37:22,331 --> 00:37:25,079
They are stronger than most adults
even.

341
00:37:26,868 --> 00:37:31,239
Of course, they do not really understand
, right?

342
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:36,232
Maybe I should take him for a while.

343
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:38,647
It might be good for him.

344
00:37:39,521 --> 00:37:42,434
I think Alice would have liked that.

345
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:45,348
He should be around another woman.

346
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:46,764
A mother figure.

347
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,510
Sophie living with us now...

348
00:37:50,552 --> 00:37:51,968
The nanny Billy...

349
00:37:52,009 --> 00:37:53,840
I think it's best if
stays home with me.

350
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:03,413
Did you hear about Alex?

351
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:06,534
Alex?

352
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,326
Alice's boyfriend.

353
00:38:09,325 --> 00:38:12,737
Apparently, he has taken
Alice's death very badly.

354
00:38:12,905 --> 00:38:14,901
He is completely devastated.

355
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:18,191
Say he had to go to a hospital.

356
00:38:18,232 --> 00:38:19,730
To recover.

357
00:38:19,854 --> 00:38:20,854
Yes

358
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:23,434
I give a shit.

359
00:38:25,765 --> 00:38:27,181
Do you understand me?

360
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,804
No
I could care less, I have my son.

361
00:38:32,258 --> 00:38:34,632
Many people loved her.

362
00:38:35,548 --> 00:38:36,796
I loved her.

363
00:38:43,497 --> 00:38:45,662
I have to go.

364
00:38:45,704 --> 00:38:47,786
I only say goodbye to Billy.

365
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:56,110
Been a long day.

366
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:10,677
Are you okay?

367
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:15,257
Lied.

368
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:18,877
I, uh, I lied to the police.

369
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:20,500
I know this Alex guy.

370
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:27,910
Actually
does not matter now anyway, right?

371
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:29,907
Was an accident.

372
00:39:30,323 --> 00:39:31,780
The thing is...

373
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,028
on the night she disappeared.

374
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,524
I went to his house,

375
00:39:38,565 --> 00:39:41,271
like that, and went after them...

376
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:46,183
and saw them in bed together.

377
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:51,095
I did nothing.

378
00:39:51,136 --> 00:39:53,301
Know, I could have done,
but I did not. I just went.

379
00:39:53,385 --> 00:39:54,508
Not even see me.

380
00:39:55,756 --> 00:39:57,255
On the way home I felt...

381
00:39:57,339 --> 00:40:01,750
so sick
just had to go to the public baths...

382
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,831
canal side and
vomited everywhere,

383
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,992
and remember,
I was feeling sick, and I looked up,

384
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:12,547
and someone
looking over the cubicle wall to me.

385
00:40:12,823 --> 00:40:14,278
Was a man.

386
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:18,525
I managed to get to the
door, and just before I passed out.

387
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,065
Swear I saw him with his hands around her throat
,

388
00:40:21,356 --> 00:40:27,890
and he was, he was trying to kill
.

389
00:40:28,432 --> 00:40:31,679
He was killing her, and could not
move, could do nothing.

390
00:40:32,595 --> 00:40:34,801
And then when he did not return
home the next day...

391
00:40:34,836 --> 00:40:37,340
I mean, I've seen
was real... Clare...

392
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:38,381
was very real.

393
00:40:40,795 --> 00:40:42,500
So you have to tell the police
.

394
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:44,915
Tell them that what
I said, do not even know,

395
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:46,663
not even know how the guy looked.

396
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:48,120
No matter, tell them anyway...

397
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:52,947
Once you tell them
followed Alice into that house, that would be it.

398
00:40:52,982 --> 00:40:53,655
Okay?

399
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:55,699
They, they just, they just
thought it was me.

400
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:57,069
What are you going to do?

401
00:40:58,401 --> 00:40:59,941
I have to find him first.

402
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:02,146
As I have that.

411
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:09,059
The old camera.

412
00:43:10,515 --> 00:43:12,304
Eh, no, sorry.
What I do now.

413
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:14,470
Okay.
Do it in the morning.

I found online.

420
00:43:34,324 --> 00:43:35,532
Just reviewed it.

421
00:43:35,615 --> 00:43:37,613
Let's see if I can find similarities.

422
00:43:38,987 --> 00:43:39,987
David.

423
00:43:41,858 --> 00:43:46,021
You must take time to mourn,
not think about things like this.

424
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,353
I'll find something.

425
00:43:48,394 --> 00:43:50,349
Yes, only
I have to keep looking, that's all.

426
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:55,969

431
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,204
Go! It's great!

432
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:12,166
I hope you do not mind.
I know how busy you are.

433
00:44:12,202 --> 00:44:13,202
No, of course not.

434
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,075
I had completely forgotten.

435
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,360
Daddy, pick me up, so I
put the angel on top.

436
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:21,475
Want
put the angel on top, right?

437
00:44:23,275 --> 00:44:24,605
To mere above.

438
00:44:25,397 --> 00:44:27,311
Okay, here we go. Are you ready?

00:45:06,979 --> 00:45:08,270
Sorry to bother you.

443
00:45:11,226 --> 00:45:12,847
Was thinking we could make a real...

444
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:15,051
effort with decorations and stuff this year.

445
00:45:17,218 --> 00:45:18,682
I think it would be good for Billy.

446
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:20,958
What do you think?
I could buy more lights for the stars.

447
00:45:22,381 --> 00:45:25,709
And yes, I thought I could decorate
all the other rooms and stuff...

448
00:45:26,376 --> 00:45:28,165
do, like, very Christmassy.

449
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:29,849
Yes

450
00:45:29,873 --> 00:45:31,411
Yes That sounds a good idea..

451
00:45:32,828 --> 00:45:34,242
Okay?

452
00:45:37,781 --> 00:45:39,238
Yes, I'm fine.

Goodnight Sophie.

456
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:49,707
Want us to move?

457
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:52,039
Is not good, stay where you are.

458
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:33,161
Hello...

459
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:34,579
anybody there?

460
00:48:39,094 --> 00:48:40,094
Sophie?

461
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:46,714
Sorry!

462
00:48:46,836 --> 00:48:47,836
Sorry.

463
00:48:51,415 --> 00:48:52,415
Sorry...

464
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,119
Look, can you come to my
room for a second?

465
00:48:58,324 --> 00:48:59,324
Why?

466
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:03,155
Hey, just for a second.

467
00:49:11,853 --> 00:49:14,558
Do not... Listen! He is very weak.

468
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,556
- What would that be?
- Just listen.

469
00:49:22,051 --> 00:49:23,175
Do you hear?

470
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:25,713
I can not hear anything.

471
00:49:28,586 --> 00:49:29,667
No, he stopped.

472
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:31,416
There's something behind there.

473
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,955
Maybe it's just a rat.

474
00:49:33,997 --> 00:49:35,370
No, no.
It's not a rat.

475
00:49:39,116 --> 00:49:40,199
I can not hear anything.

476
00:49:42,404 --> 00:49:43,568
What can you hear?

477
00:49:43,612 --> 00:49:45,572
Is someone whispering as if in prayer.

478
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:52,810
Maybe it's just the house next door.

479
00:49:52,852 --> 00:49:53,852
I do not know...

480
00:49:57,389 --> 00:49:59,109
no, no, no, the walls are very solid.

481
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:02,593
Dad, what are you doing? He slept.

482
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:03,300

483
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:04,424
Billy, go to bed.

484
00:50:04,923 --> 00:50:05,923
Okay.

00:50:15,495 --> 00:50:17,493
Come.
We have to go to bed.

488

What does Dad?

490
00:51:35,206 --> 00:51:36,206
What?

491
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Billy, go to your room, get dressed.

492
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,026
You and Sophie will go from here.

493
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:49,858
I'll just wrap the belt.

494
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:52,981
That is.

495

Sophie, sorry for this.

499
00:52:06,091 --> 00:52:07,840
You're just going to have to trust me
. OK?

500
00:52:07,964 --> 00:52:11,544

is not safe for you and Billy.

Come on... Come on...

507
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,228
Okay, just happens...

508
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:40,265
Okay, there...
There, you see?

509
00:52:41,612 --> 00:52:42,612
Yes...

510
00:52:42,636 --> 00:52:44,218
I see.
Is anyone there.

511
00:52:44,342 --> 00:52:45,385
Okay, there's more...

512
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,420
Just wait...

513
00:52:48,048 --> 00:52:49,048
And there... There...

514
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:51,085
Did you see its outline?

515
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,208
Hard to say,
could be just a shadow.

516
00:52:53,243 --> 00:52:54,541
Oh come on, there's someone there.

517
00:52:56,248 --> 00:52:58,454
Maybe. It's really hard to say.

518
00:53:00,785 --> 00:53:02,449
Tell me what you think about this?

519
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:04,656
Believe what?

520
00:53:04,863 --> 00:53:06,487
This is the man who killed Alice.

521
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:10,982
This is the same man who
saw on the night he was killed.

522
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:12,481
What do you mean?

523
00:53:12,855 --> 00:53:14,646
I think there are ghosts in my house.

524
00:53:15,437 --> 00:53:16,976
David...!

525
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:21,140
I know this sounds crazy, believe me, I know how fucking
crazy this sounds,

526
00:53:21,181 --> 00:53:25,301
but I've seen things, I hear things,
is the only rational explanation.

527
00:53:26,218 --> 00:53:28,048
- I do not think so!
- Yes it is!

528
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:29,920
Okay, okay,
wait until you hear this.

529
00:53:30,212 --> 00:53:32,461
In the 1930s seances were carried out at home
,

530
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,415
people said they saw a shadow, a shadow.

531
00:53:35,457 --> 00:53:37,372
Is it a coincidence, that's all.

532
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:40,160
The previous owner,
way, the Realtor...

533
00:53:40,201 --> 00:53:42,200
said it was an old woman who was senile
,

534
00:53:42,575 --> 00:53:43,575
but was not.

535
00:53:45,116 --> 00:53:46,528
We lied.

536
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:51,523
Was a young woman who tried
burn his house while his family slept.

537
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:56,603
Now his son died in the fire,
but swore that he did not.

538
00:53:57,352 --> 00:53:58,808
Like me with Alice.

539
00:53:58,843 --> 00:54:00,265
Said it was the devil.

540
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:03,346
Said a man who could not see
, tried to rape her.

541
00:54:03,387 --> 00:54:05,968
Said he was a demon
living behind walls.

542
00:54:06,468 --> 00:54:07,925
The walls, Clare.

543
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:10,506
Stop for a moment.
Stop for a moment.

544
00:54:10,922 --> 00:54:14,916
Could you
think what you're saying?

545
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:19,163
Think I'm having a nervous breakdown is not it?

546
00:54:23,449 --> 00:54:24,656
Well, maybe I have.

547
00:54:27,487 --> 00:54:28,487
No.

548
00:54:29,194 --> 00:54:31,733
- Well, maybe...
- Only these exhausted.

549
00:54:35,729 --> 00:54:37,811
- Right? .
- Yes

550
00:54:50,714 --> 00:54:51,714
Billy?

551
00:54:53,419 --> 00:54:54,459
Sophie?

552
00:54:57,249 --> 00:54:58,581
Billy can you hear me?

553
00:54:59,415 --> 00:55:02,327
<i>Dad, why do not you come to see us today</i>

554
00:55:02,659 --> 00:55:03,749
Sorry.

555
00:55:03,784 --> 00:55:05,864
Wanted, simply
I did not feel very well.

556
00:55:06,322 --> 00:55:08,779
<i>Can you come and see us tomorrow</i>

557
00:55:09,611 --> 00:55:11,525
Yes
Yes, I promise.

558
00:55:13,356 --> 00:55:14,563
What have you eaten?

559
00:55:14,938 --> 00:55:19,558
<i>We ate burgers, fries, ice cream and
Coca-Cola for dinner </i>.

560
00:55:19,593 --> 00:55:20,690
Go...

561
00:55:20,725 --> 00:55:24,512
<i>My belly is big, look how fat
I'm Dad</i>

562
00:55:56,438 --> 00:55:58,518
Sophie Billy does this again
in the room with you?

563
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:01,598
<i>No, still in the shower </i>.

564
00:56:06,426 --> 00:56:08,883
Billy, I want you to move the laptop around
, okay?

565
00:56:09,549 --> 00:56:11,838
Just move the laptop around for
can see the rest of the room, dale.

566
00:56:11,879 --> 00:56:12,879
Please?

567
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:15,851
Keep moving...

568
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:16,996
keeps moving the laptop.

569
00:56:18,165 --> 00:56:20,913
That's it. Good boy.
Keep moving a little more...

570
00:56:21,954 --> 00:56:22,954
that's all...

571
00:56:23,743 --> 00:56:25,075
just had to see...

572
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,115
room.

573
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:30,653
What is that?

574
00:56:36,913 --> 00:56:37,913
Billy...

575
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:40,018
Billy!
Billy, leave the room!

576
00:56:42,516 --> 00:56:45,762
Billy!

577
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

578
00:57:03,826 --> 00:57:06,033
Sorry, sorry.

579
00:57:29,718 --> 00:57:31,964
How did you get here so fast?

580
00:58:09,801 --> 00:58:11,093
Mr. Williams?

581
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:16,421
I'm not sure if
I work here anymore.

582
00:58:17,709 --> 00:58:19,125
I do not know what is happening.

583
00:58:20,473 --> 00:58:21,473
Y...

584
00:58:21,497 --> 00:58:23,787
if it were not for Billy,
think I would go now.

585
00:58:29,323 --> 00:58:30,445
Understand.

586
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:35,607
Yes, you're right, you gotta go.

587
00:58:39,103 --> 00:58:41,519
I can not guarantee your safety and and...

588
00:58:44,682 --> 00:58:47,554
is not sure
're around.

589
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:51,507
I do not want to leave behind Billy...

590
00:58:53,298 --> 00:58:56,337
but really do not think it's right, Mr. Williams.

591
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:03,953
Maybe if you tell me what was happening
, would understand or could help.

592
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:10,696
Please Sophie,
have to leave tomorrow.

593
00:59:13,443 --> 00:59:15,566

595
00:59:20,604 --> 00:59:22,059
No, okay.
I'll be fine.

00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,307
No. No, no, please.

597
00:59:24,766 --> 00:59:25,766
You will not.

598
00:59:28,013 --> 00:59:32,008
Mr. Williams, I want to talk to you
about this again in the morning.

599
00:59:32,508 --> 00:59:34,215
About me bringing me, I mean.

600
00:59:35,879 --> 00:59:36,879
Yes

601
00:59:38,835 --> 00:59:39,835
Good night.

602
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000

606
01:01:48,619 --> 01:01:50,491
Come on, get out.

607
01:01:50,532 --> 01:01:52,447
No... What are you doing!?

608
01:01:53,488 --> 01:01:54,944
Just downstairs...

609
01:02:00,688 --> 01:02:02,646
<i>Let me out</i>

610
01:02:04,935 --> 01:02:06,643
<i>Let me out</i>

611
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,555
<i>Mr. ! Williams</i>

612
01:02:13,301 --> 01:02:15,757
Where is dad, who is in the house?

613
01:02:18,214 --> 01:02:19,214
Do not know...

614
01:02:21,084 --> 01:02:23,833
No.

615
01:02:30,407 --> 01:02:32,281
Mr. Williams, let me out.

616
01:02:36,444 --> 01:02:37,651
Let us leave...

617
01:02:37,694 --> 01:02:38,857
Billy afraid...

618
01:02:45,768 --> 01:02:46,934
've checked everywhere.

619
01:02:47,348 --> 01:02:48,348
Dad!

620
01:02:51,013 --> 01:02:52,261
Me and Billy...

621
01:02:52,386 --> 01:02:54,026
were following someone out...

622
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:55,801
Okay, then I heard her scream.

623
01:02:57,548 --> 01:02:59,379
're Trying to separate.

624
01:03:00,086 --> 01:03:01,419
Did you see anyone up there?

625
01:03:04,582 --> 01:03:05,582
Did you?

626
01:03:06,164 --> 01:03:07,164
Let Billy!

627
01:03:07,662 --> 01:03:08,662
No, no...

628
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,534
Billy will stay with me.

629
01:03:17,152 --> 01:03:18,152
Sophie...!

630
01:03:36,757 --> 01:03:38,589
Hey Billy...

631
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:46,040
Have you seen other people in the house?

632
01:03:50,968 --> 01:03:51,968
Billy...

633
01:03:51,992 --> 01:03:54,240
if you see someone, you know
you have to say?

634
01:03:54,738 --> 01:03:55,738
Right?

635
01:03:56,861 --> 01:03:57,861
Are you sure?

636
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:03,895
<i>Where is Sophie</i>

637
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:08,730
<i>DEEP WATER HAZARD
STAY AWAY - She left this morning</i>

638
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:11,226
<i>DEEP WATER HAZARD
STAY AWAY. .
- She will not back</i>

639
01:04:22,295 --> 01:04:23,667
Billy... You see that woman?

640
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:24,792
Where?

641
01:04:27,371 --> 01:04:28,371
There...

642
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:31,078
's See, he's hiding in the grass?

643
01:04:31,161 --> 01:04:33,033
I can not see anyone.

644
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:53,885
Are we going to see my teacher today?

645
01:04:54,469 --> 01:04:55,760
No. Not today.

646
01:05:05,583 --> 01:05:06,831
Billy... Billy returns.

647
01:05:06,873 --> 01:05:09,294
- Go.
Back... - What?

648
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:12,117
Go... Go
hide behind the wall.

649
01:05:19,293 --> 01:05:20,293
Come on...

650
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:22,358
Turn... Turn, count to 10.

651
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,191
Okay?

652
01:05:23,249 --> 01:05:24,249
One...

653
01:05:24,273 --> 01:05:25,273
two... Forward...

654
01:05:28,058 --> 01:05:29,058
1...

655
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,848
2...

656
01:05:36,716 --> 01:05:38,132
4...

657
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:50,870
10...!

658
01:05:56,323 --> 01:05:59,943
Is this a game of hide and seek,
can I open my eyes now?

659
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:12,390
Clare...

660
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:13,431
David...

661
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:14,637
Are you okay?

662
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:17,718
- Hey, Billy!
- Hello!

663
01:06:19,382 --> 01:06:22,337
- I need to disclose this.
- What is it?

664
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,127
's Nothing.

665
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:27,961
Just let me reveal,
did not take long.

666
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:30,871
You need to tell me what is first.

667
01:06:32,285 --> 01:06:34,532
Please Clare, do not make me beg.

668
01:06:36,114 --> 01:06:37,488
Really have to see this.

669
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:42,442
- Please.
- OK.

670
01:06:44,106 --> 01:06:46,022
But it will be a couple of days though.

671
01:06:46,057 --> 01:06:48,352
No. No, I have to see him today...

672
01:06:49,768 --> 01:06:51,182
Well... I need him now.

673
01:06:51,515 --> 01:06:53,180
Is completely full here.

674
01:06:54,197 --> 01:06:55,197
Come on.

675
01:06:55,221 --> 01:06:57,094
Well,
I'll get it done, I promise.

676
01:06:59,051 --> 01:07:01,297
I'll bring  Even when
is done, right?

677
01:07:02,963 --> 01:07:03,963
Look...

678
01:07:05,544 --> 01:07:06,750
I've been thinking...

679
01:07:08,829 --> 01:07:10,453
Maybe you should talk to someone?

680
01:07:10,488 --> 01:07:11,488
Know, maybe...

681
01:07:13,243 --> 01:07:15,616
A grief counselor or something.

682
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:20,170
Just...

683
01:07:20,194 --> 01:07:21,777
think about it, okay?

684
01:07:25,565 --> 01:07:26,565
I will.

685
01:07:34,472 --> 01:07:37,051
If someone
walk here this evening, will see their footprints.

686
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:39,174
It Snow!

687
01:07:39,423 --> 01:07:40,923
Can I continue?

688
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:41,958
Yes!

689
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:48,041
Now no one can enter without us knowing.

690
01:08:06,981 --> 01:08:08,729
<i>You like me</i>

691
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

692
01:09:35,764 --> 01:09:37,429
What about all the dust, Dave?

693
01:09:37,844 --> 01:09:40,176
Meal is cooking.

694
01:09:41,715 --> 01:09:42,716
Do not tell me?

695
01:09:43,422 --> 01:09:45,712
What about all the flour,
're making a cake?

696
01:09:45,747 --> 01:09:46,747
What do you want?

697
01:09:47,877 --> 01:09:49,125
Dress.

698
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:50,166
You come with me.

699
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:56,783
Found a hammer in the channel,
with your fingerprints on it.

700
01:09:58,366 --> 01:10:00,780
A hammer that belonged to loving your wife.

701
01:10:02,819 --> 01:10:05,234
He says he was lost, the
night she disappeared.

702
01:10:06,566 --> 01:10:07,897
Can you explain that?

703
01:10:10,562 --> 01:10:12,392
There was a murder in my house...

704
01:10:12,434 --> 01:10:13,809
in 1902.

705
01:10:14,766 --> 01:10:15,766
What...?

706
01:10:16,637 --> 01:10:19,720
You can check all this;
And a man killed his entire family.

707
01:10:20,801 --> 01:10:21,883
You understand me...

708
01:10:22,675 --> 01:10:24,338
and I think he was the one who did it.

709
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,712
I have evidence, I caught something on film
.

710
01:10:28,666 --> 01:10:30,499
's A ghost.

711
01:10:32,997 --> 01:10:34,369
We will see in a few days.

712
01:10:37,783 --> 01:10:39,906
As welfare official
senior, I have...

713
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:42,029
choice but to recommend appropriate to Services...

714
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,984
Social and recommend that the child is taken care.

715
01:10:45,026 --> 01:10:47,030
Is not that a little harsh?

716
01:10:47,065 --> 01:10:49,604
Mr. Williams has just lost his wife.

717
01:10:49,646 --> 01:10:53,392
Its symptoms are clearly part of a process of mourning.

718
01:10:53,685 --> 01:10:56,182
Enclose nannies in closets and hearing voices...?

719
01:10:56,223 --> 01:10:59,096
Behind walls, is
part of the grieving process?

720
01:10:59,137 --> 01:11:01,177
It was just a nanny and
people react...

721
01:11:01,218 --> 01:11:03,554
differently to the death of a loved one...

722
01:11:03,589 --> 01:11:07,546
and, incidentally, is the same nanny
Mr. . Williams...

723
01:11:07,587 --> 01:11:10,625
caught smoking drugs in his room, so...

724
01:11:24,818 --> 01:11:27,274
No way!

725
01:11:28,024 --> 01:11:29,064
Yes

726
01:11:30,979 --> 01:11:33,435
Yes, we can do that.

727
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:36,141
Wait to return
psychiatrist's report...

728
01:11:36,182 --> 01:11:38,102
and then we'll see what
do after that.

729
01:11:42,261 --> 01:11:44,091
I will not go to a psychiatrist.

730
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:45,382
There's nothing wrong with me.

731
01:11:45,632 --> 01:11:48,211
You have to.
We agreed on that.

732
01:11:48,253 --> 01:11:49,793
What you were. I do not.

733
01:11:50,751 --> 01:11:51,751
I will not go.

734
01:11:54,455 --> 01:11:55,536
I have to go back to Billy.

735
01:12:03,877 --> 01:12:04,877
Dad...

736
01:12:04,901 --> 01:12:06,444
Who are these men?

737
01:12:06,735 --> 01:12:08,149
Are the police.

738
01:12:08,184 --> 01:12:09,184
Do not look.

739
01:12:28,253 --> 01:12:30,834
Is there anybody out?

740
01:12:32,959 --> 01:12:33,959
No.

741
01:12:34,873 --> 01:12:35,954
Dad...

742
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,033
What?

743
01:12:42,198 --> 01:12:44,902
Never leave me, right?

744
01:12:47,317 --> 01:12:49,024
No. Of course not.

745
01:12:49,773 --> 01:12:53,937
What if you die as
Mommy, what would become of me then?

746
01:12:59,306 --> 01:13:01,095
Never leave you, Billy.

747
01:13:02,385 --> 01:13:03,508
Never.

748
01:13:06,214 --> 01:13:08,004
And always be together, you and me.

749
01:13:08,212 --> 01:13:09,212
Okay?

750
01:13:12,251 --> 01:13:13,416
Now, close your eyes.

751
01:14:12,771 --> 01:14:14,978
<i>REVENGE VIL</i>

752
01:16:54,314 --> 01:16:56,894
- Did you see it?
- No.

753
01:17:00,972 --> 01:17:01,972
Would you...?

754
01:17:02,264 --> 01:17:03,680
Do you want to see me?

755
01:17:05,179 --> 01:17:08,050
I'm afraid to look for myself.

756
01:17:10,255 --> 01:17:11,255
Okay.

757
01:17:14,752 --> 01:17:16,332
Go watch TV, go...

758
01:17:34,106 --> 01:17:36,602
David... Do you remember
call me last night?

759
01:17:39,392 --> 01:17:40,432
Last night? No.

760
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,600
You did.

761
01:17:44,594 --> 01:17:47,675
You were delirious, I hardly recognized your voice.

762
01:17:51,381 --> 01:17:52,381
You were crying.

763
01:17:56,209 --> 01:18:01,496
You said you wanted to tell me something about Alice.

764
01:18:03,283 --> 01:18:05,117
That was not me. I have not called.

765
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:08,779
Ven. Sit.

766
01:18:13,024 --> 01:18:21,024
If you hurt, if
did, maybe you should...

767
01:18:21,889 --> 01:18:27,635
done with it...
I go to the police.

768
01:18:29,176 --> 01:18:31,256
'll Go with you, if
want it to.

769
01:18:33,378 --> 01:18:37,209
I'll tell you how good a person you are.

770
01:18:39,497 --> 01:18:41,287
I'll help.

771
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:46,490
Clare, sacrificed children in this room...

772
01:18:48,614 --> 01:18:49,614
do not you know?

773
01:18:51,319 --> 01:18:53,402
David what are you talking about?

774
01:18:54,066 --> 01:18:56,772
The blood of a baby is
more powerful, do you see?

775
01:18:57,397 --> 01:19:00,456
They dragged the bodies through here...

776
01:19:00,491 --> 01:19:03,515
sewers and dumped in the canal.

777
01:19:03,931 --> 01:19:05,763
In the canal!

778
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:08,009
They... They thought of everything...

779
01:19:08,051 --> 01:19:09,216
David, stop, stop!

780
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,714
Just... Look at me!

781
01:19:15,127 --> 01:19:16,874
You killed Alice?

782
01:19:21,246 --> 01:19:24,785
Just say
did not... Look into my eyes.

783
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:26,158
Say you did not.

784
01:19:27,157 --> 01:19:29,030
Say you did not, please!

785
01:19:29,755 --> 01:19:30,755
Just tell me!

786
01:19:30,779 --> 01:19:34,316
Whatever you say, I think.

787
01:19:36,523 --> 01:19:38,728
Whatever you say, whatever you say
thing, I believe you.

788
01:19:40,352 --> 01:19:41,352
'll Believe you...

789
01:19:42,558 --> 01:19:43,850
I'll believe you...

790
01:19:44,306 --> 01:19:45,306
Just tell me...

791
01:19:51,008 --> 01:19:52,008
just tell me...

792
01:20:12,652 --> 01:20:13,652
Just look at this.

793
01:20:14,191 --> 01:20:15,233
Then you'll understand.

794
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:18,771
Yes, we... We will see this.

795
01:20:38,543 --> 01:20:39,943
Okay, there it is... Do not you see?

796
01:20:40,457 --> 01:20:41,457
Moves...

797
01:20:43,537 --> 01:20:44,537
Do you see?

798
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:48,159
David...

799
01:20:49,364 --> 01:20:50,364
nothing there.

800
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:54,194
Just wait, wait... there's more.

801
01:20:58,939 --> 01:21:00,187
Okay... there... there!

802
01:21:00,686 --> 01:21:01,686
You see ?, there, look!

803
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:03,225
What is it there?

804
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:06,681
Moves to us, do not you see?

805
01:21:09,717 --> 01:21:10,717
What is it?

806
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:17,461
- Yes... I see something...
- See it?

807
01:21:18,268 --> 01:21:19,268
I see something.

808
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:21,249
I told you I'm telling the truth...

809
01:21:21,284 --> 01:21:21,880
What is it?

810
01:21:21,915 --> 01:21:25,162
No I'm going crazy!

811
01:21:25,197 --> 01:21:25,928
You understand me...

812
01:21:25,963 --> 01:21:26,660
look there!

813
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:27,701
What is it?

814
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:33,487
David...

815
01:21:34,402 --> 01:21:35,692
David, turn it off!

816
01:21:35,733 --> 01:21:37,231
Turn it off, what is it?

817
01:21:39,271 --> 01:21:40,686
David what is it?

818
01:21:44,183 --> 01:21:46,430
David, please turn it off!

819
01:21:55,214 --> 01:21:56,255
Nooo!

01:21:59,627 --> 01:22:00,916
To!

821
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:20,230
What happens then?

822
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:21,770
Not me.

823
01:22:21,894 --> 01:22:23,067
We saw him enter the house with a woman,

824
01:22:23,102 --> 01:22:26,723
- then we heard her screams.
- What have you done, David?

825
01:22:26,847 --> 01:22:27,847
What have you done?

826
01:22:31,261 --> 01:22:32,261
I did not!

827
01:22:35,298 --> 01:22:36,463

844
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:33,291
<i>Do you see</i>

845
01:23:33,315 --> 01:23:34,315

- Oh, yeah,

872
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:35,197
the house will be empty next
Fridays. I do not want to waste time.

873
