Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,406
Harper?!

3
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,115
Are you fucking kidding me?

4
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,017
This dude is so crazy!

5
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,619
I don't
understand why they're acting

6
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,020
like this is not a problem.

7
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,355
I mean, it's bullshit.

8
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:38,090
He's a complete asshole to her.

9
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,626
She deserves so much better.
She doesn't want a stalker.

10
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:43,295
She already has a stalker.

11
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:46,865
<i>Aaah! No! Aah!</i>

12
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,501
<i>Johnny! Help me!</i>

13
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,945
Yeah?

14
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,118
Hey.

15
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,288
Did your boyfriend just
throw a pumpkin at our door?

16
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,723
What?

17
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,792
That's not something he'd do.

18
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,061
No, no, no. That's bullshit.

19
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,829
Bailey.

20
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,331
No, you are breaking up
with this bitch tonight, okay?

21
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,800
Don't!

22
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,402
Bailey, stop!

23
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,872
Everything's fine.

24
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,640
He's an alcoholic, Harper.

25
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:31,376
You want to know how I can tell?

26
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,880
Because he's an alcoholic.

27
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,583
Look, all I'm saying is that
I came into your room last night

28
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,985
to steal some jewelry
for my Halloween costume,

29
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,320
and you were passed out.

30
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:44,489
Careful. That's my mom's.

31
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,161
Harper, you had a bruise
on your face.

32
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,070
Do you see a bruise?

33
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,105
There's minor swelling,
indicating a contusion

34
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,274
on the orbital plate.

35
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:03,842
You should come out
with us, though...

36
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:07,546
Get your mind off
of the boyfriend drama.

37
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:10,382
I don't have a costume.
It would be weird.

38
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,284
It's Halloween.

39
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:14,453
Weird is good.

40
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,864
<i>Then he grabbed me!</i>

41
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:30,135
<i>He grabbed me,
and he ripped at me!</i>

42
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:33,972
<i>He held me, and he ripped
at my clothes!</i>

43
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,108
<i>Just calm down.</i>

44
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,812
<i>Oh! I screamed, "Johnny!
Johnny, help me!"</i>

45
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,485
Delish!

46
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,720
What kind of hooch
are we bootleggin'?

47
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,089
Spider vodka.

48
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,924
Fuck off. No, really.
It's from Thailand.

49
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,326
They put a ceremonial spider
in every bottle.

50
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,894
You don't want to touch it?

51
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,396
Nope. I know it's Halloween.
I'm not doing that.

52
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:58,997
Seriously? You're still
afraid of spiders?

53
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,299
Yeah.

54
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,834
Ladies, say, "Happy Ho-lloween!"

55
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,637
Happy Ho-lloween!

56
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,239
Oh, my God. Nathan!

57
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,976
Nathan!

58
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,511
Hey. What's up?

59
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:13,812
How are you?
Surprised you found me.

60
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,013
This place is crazy.
Oh, my gosh.

61
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,982
Ty Hoffman!

62
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,286
Bitch, what's up? How are you?

63
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,846
Hey.

64
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,614
Hey.

65
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:54,486
Did you need something?

66
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,321
What?

67
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:57,789
Oh. You were just
talking to my friend,

68
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,558
and then you waved me over.

69
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,627
Oh. No, I'm sorry.

70
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,229
I was motioning
for another drink.

71
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:07,499
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm so sorry. Uh...
No, it's cool. So, wait.
Do you... Do you know Bailey?
Yeah. Yeah,
we met freshman year.

73
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:17,342
Are you one of her
yoga students?

74
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,643
No. No?

75
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,479
I'm her roommate... Harper.

76
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,881
Oh, yeah, no. Yeah.
I've totally heard about you.

77
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,249
Oh, yeah? What'd you hear?

78
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,887
- Happy Halloween!
- Happy Halloween!

79
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,723
That scare you? Yes.

80
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,693
Yeah, well, um, I'm surprised
we haven't met before.

81
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,661
I don't get out much.

82
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,664
I don't really
get out much, either.

83
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,166
Someone literally reminded me
it was Halloween

84
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,734
like 15 minutes ago,

85
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,004
so I just rolled out of bed
and grabbed my lucky bat.

86
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,773
I kind of hate these things.

87
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,841
Yeah, well, at least
you have a costume.

88
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,177
What are you talking about?
You have a costume.

89
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,447
If... If you don't mind,
you can do that and...

90
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,783
Boom, look...
Little Red Riding Hood.

91
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:00,852
- Bullshit!
- Evan.

92
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,287
I'm sick of this shit!

93
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,890
What the fuck
are you doing, dude?

94
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,726
I'm so sorry about that.
Fuck this shit show.

95
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,895
What the fuck are you
supposed to be, anyways?

96
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,230
What do you mean, what the fuck
am I supposed to be?

97
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,799
I'm the front half
of a human centipede.

98
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,634
The other two dudes just bailed,

99
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,736
so now I'm walking around,
looking like a fucking jackass.

100
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,738
Oh, now you look like a jackass?

101
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,240
Did they bail 'cause they didn't
want to eat ass all night?

102
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,809
No.

103
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,644
They probably bailed
'cause this bar sucks dick.

104
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,547
I think they were just fucking
with you, dude.

105
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,282
Oberhaus and K.C. are
right over there

106
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,584
with the rest of the team.
Motherfuckers.

107
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,987
No one wants to be the ass end
of a human centipede.

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

109
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,933
Hey.

110
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,668
Saw you headed towards the exit.

111
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,570
I was getting worried you left.

112
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,175
The team awarded me
worst costume.

113
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:34,980
Figured I'd share it with the runner-up.

114
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:38,216
I didn't know you were
still on the team.

115
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,886
Took a wild pitch
to the face last season.

116
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,621
Shattered my cheekbone
in three places.

117
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,122
Now I'm riding the bench.

118
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,124
Well, you can't really tell.

119
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,492
What about you?

120
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,227
What?

121
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,696
Nothing scary ever
happened to you?

122
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,998
I mean, Halloween, right?

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,399
Scary stories,
that's what you do...

124
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:57,903
Tell each other scary stories.

125
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:03,408
Uh...
like, wh-what, about my life?

126
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,644
Yeah. Nothing scary
ever happened to you?

127
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,178
I-I don't know.

128
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,517
I mean, I-I had a really
great childhood.

129
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,988
Um, have a great relationship
with my parents.

130
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,861
Well, I<i> had</i> a great
relationship with them.

131
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,764
I don't talk to
my parents much, either.

132
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,943
I think I should go.

133
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,178
I think you should stay.

134
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,849
Wait. Where are we going next?

135
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,418
- The haunted corn maze is open late.
- No.

136
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,919
Yes! I know the cast!

137
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,754
No, that place is a breeding
ground for parasites.

138
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,089
My cousin Kim...
She's a health inspector,

139
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,857
and she gave it a "D."

140
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,693
Why don't we, uh, hit up
the food trucks on campus,

141
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,127
Netflix a scary movie, yeah?

142
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,362
- Dude, I could eat.
- I'm hungry, too.

143
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,364
Yo, yo, yo, guys, guys, guys!

144
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:00,932
Or...

145
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,367
we could go to
an extreme haunted house.

146
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,268
- Yes.
- Haunted house.

147
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,636
- Yes.
- No!

148
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,738
- I don't want to do that.
- Let's do it.

149
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,306
Well, there's at least
five haunts in the area.

150
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,475
Somebody pick so we can call
this shit a night.

151
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,444
There we go.

152
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,878
Wait. Evan, what are you doing?

153
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,647
I'm paying my tuition.

154
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,415
Hey, guys, water? Anybody?

155
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,316
- Yes.
- Yes, yes, yes.

156
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,284
Got mints here.

157
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,285
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

158
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,053
What is this?

159
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,322
Uh, that would be Dasani, flat,
and Altoids cinnamons.

160
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,057
Yeah, no. If you think we're
actually gonna pay you

161
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,059
to drive us to a haunted house
that you wanted to go to...

162
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,828
I'm a professional
in the rideshare business.

163
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,130
I can't just give you a free
ride because you're my buddies.

164
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,232
Oh, well. It's not fair
to the paying customers.

165
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,467
I'm all about fairness.

166
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,601
Always have been.
You have to be.

167
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:39,504
5-star-rated, baby!

168
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,905
I'm glad you understand.
What are you doing?

169
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,208
No! Hey! What the fuck, dude?!

170
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,316
Okay, guys.

171
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,519
There's a Jaycees
that's just past the mill.

172
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,755
We are not going to Jaycees. No.

173
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,623
We just do it a lot. That's all.

174
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,191
Too much settling.
Okay. Just find one.

175
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,060
I'll find another one.

176
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,634
Hey, Evan,
can you turn up there?

177
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,603
- Huh?
- Turn up there.

178
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,872
Yeah.

179
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,173
Whoa, wait. Where are we going?

180
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,841
Yeah, Harper,
where are we going?

181
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,117
Is someone following us?

182
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,387
Isn't there a haunted
house at the hospital tonight?

183
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,690
Yeah, there is, but
I really don't want to show

184
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,812
my face there with my grades
looking the way they are.

185
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,633
Evan, what's going on?

186
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:44,836
Harper thinks
we're being stalked.

187
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,905
No, it's just...

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
did anyone see that truck
follow us back from the bar?

189
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,864
This cannot be ignored.

190
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,858
Oh, this looks like
the haunt from Evan's flyer.

191
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,127
Evan, if this sucks,
it's on you.

192
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,729
Guys, I love you all,
but I'm over it.

193
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,865
I got to fix my car
in the morning.

194
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,768
Fuck your car!
This is the bee's knees!

195
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,437
Guys, there's only
one review on Yelp.

196
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,907
Oh, but it says the proceeds go
to Red Cross, so that's cool.

197
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,642
You know what? I'm with Bailey.

198
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,878
I think it's getting
kind of late.

199
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,379
We should probably just...

200
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,482
Harper, you promised
to have a fun night.

201
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,088
I hate it when I make promises.

202
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,991
- Oh, my head!
- Where's Evan?

203
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,425
Wait. Hold up.

204
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,161
- Thanks.
- Evan!

205
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:19,397
I'm comin' for ya.
I'm comin' for ya.

206
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,965
Rah!

207
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,503
Oh.

208
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:28,940
- Yazzah?
- Yazzah!

209
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,742
Ooh, Evan's afraid of clowns.

210
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:33,178
- Oh, hello, clown!
- Hello.

211
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,480
Hello, Mr. Clown.

212
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,221
Can we have six tickets, please?

213
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,294
No? Okay.

214
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:50,995
- That's a good try.
- Excuse me.

215
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,232
We'd like to enter your
shady-ass establishment, please.

216
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:56,835
- Oh.
- Oh.

217
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,636
- Okay.
- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

218
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,939
This is scary.

219
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,509
Okay. Bailey, after you?

220
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,611
This is a Bailey job.

221
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,559
Okay. It's obviously
not in that hand.

222
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,561
Pick the other hand.

223
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,027
- Ooh.
- It's a key. It's a key.

224
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,396
Five stars for this place
with the creepy-ass clown

225
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,398
doing shitty-ass magic.

226
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,503
So, like, do you do
birthdays and shit, too?

227
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:09,507
Is this like a seasonal gig
for you?

228
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,409
I got a niece who loves
scary fucking clowns,

229
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,913
so I'm looking to acquire
your services.

230
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,447
I'll get a card before we leave.

231
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,783
You can pull it out of
wherever you want to.

232
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:22,353
- What is it?
- Liability waiver.

233
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,389
It says, "Haunted house rules."

234
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,791
Rule number one... stay on
the marked path at all times.

235
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,127
"Rule number two...
Never touch the actors."

236
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,429
No promises.
"Rule number three..."

237
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,933
You will be prompted
to do certain actions.

238
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,768
Please do exactly
as you are told.

239
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,137
This is for your safety.

240
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,972
Rule number four...
All cellphones

241
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:43,041
must be surrendered
to the lock box before entering.

242
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,943
You may keep the lock box key

243
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,444
"until you return
from the attraction."

244
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,147
Are you kidding me? What?

245
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,449
No, I just think that's probably
gonna be the scariest part for you...

246
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,318
Not having your phone on you
at all times.

247
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,286
Guys, we're basically signing
our lives away to this thing.

248
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,448
- I don't think it's...
- Yes!

249
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,796
Yes. Yes. We're doing this. Yes.

250
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:08,566
Okay.

251
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,909
All righty. Let's go.

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Okay.

253
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:38,262
- Ooh.
- This is a little... lame.

254
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,630
Yeah. Okay.

255
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,499
Is this supposed to be scary?

256
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,967
The only thing that would
scare Bailey

257
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,302
is if they defunded
Planned Parenthood.

258
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,270
Am I right?

259
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,139
Aah!

260
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,607
Ha, ha, ha. Ho, ho.

261
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,875
Oh, that's what you get.

262
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,415
Uh-oh. I feel like
that's not a good idea.

263
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,013
Whoa!

264
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,214
Wow! This is awesome.

265
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,582
It's getting better.

266
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,721
- There's a wall.
- Yeah, no, I found it.

267
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,389
- I found the wall.
- Yeah.

268
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,225
Yo, guys, guys, guys, guys.

269
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,362
Oh, that's a real guy.

270
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,998
- Oh, definitely.
- Oh, yeah.

271
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,486
Oh, my God.

272
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,760
What?

273
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,629
Somebody! Somebody help me!

274
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,631
Help me, please!

275
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,434
Somebody help me!
Please help me!

276
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,238
I don't want to die!
Please, please! Just let me go!

277
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,640
I promise! I promise
I won't tell anybody!

278
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,882
Please! Please, please, please!

279
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,212
Holy shit! Holy shit!

280
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,749
Oh, my God.

281
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:42,053
- Oh, that was so good.
- That was so good.

282
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,493
- Oh-ho-ho-ho.
- Yeah, nope.

283
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:52,296
You're going first.
You are going first. Yep.

284
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,266
- That's some sick-ass shit.
- That was crazy.

285
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,537
- Oh.
- "Bye."

286
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,107
Ooh.

287
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,276
Safe or not safe?

288
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,011
- I got dibs on not safe.
- Not safe!

289
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,013
- Of course.
- Okay.

290
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:11,115
Well, then, we will go this way.

291
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,517
You guys can go that way.

292
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,418
Oh, no.

293
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,530
- I fucking hate spiders!
- Go.

294
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,831
- Come on.
- No.

295
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,300
Come on.

296
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:32,937
Watch your head.

297
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,172
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
- What is that?

298
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,474
- Oh, my God.
- What the heck?

299
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,009
- No, no, no!
- Aah!

300
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:42,113
Oh, shit. There's, like,
real spiders in here.

301
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,150
Oh, my God.

302
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,853
You guys.

303
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,055
Guys.

304
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,524
Look.

305
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,793
Nice.

306
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,298
Wait, Nathan.

307
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,236
What is that? I don't know.

308
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,238
Oh. No way. Way to go, guys.

309
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,073
Way to wait till the last minute
to paint the walls.

310
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,709
No, this isn't paint.
This is oil.

311
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,646
Yeah. That's weird.

312
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,015
Why'd they put oil on the walls?

313
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:22,186
- Maybe it's cheaper.
- Oil's not cheaper than paint.

314
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,789
My cousin Hasib...
He's a petroleum engineer.

315
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,201
Okay.
Where are we supposed to go?

316
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,669
Maybe it's a puzzle?

317
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,972
That's weird.

318
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:02,727
I don't know.

319
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:08,432
Did you hear that?

320
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:12,303
It sounded like a door.

321
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:16,040
How do we open it?

322
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:19,243
It must only open
if the coffin's closed.

323
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:25,116
Well, I guess there's only
one way to find out.

324
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,253
If I don't return,
speak highly of me.

325
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:42,800
Yo, guys!

326
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,869
It worked!

327
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,740
I really don't like
small spaces.

328
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,876
Then just get it over with,
sweet cheeks.

329
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,022
Mallory, I'm through!

330
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,924
Okay.

331
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,226
Coming.

332
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,474
Guys?

333
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Guys, it's not...

334
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,066
Oh. No! No!

335
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,801
Oh, my God! Spiders!

336
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,404
Hold on! It's gonna open.

337
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:54,872
Oh, my God!

338
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,141
I had spiders all over! Mallory.

339
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:59,243
Mallory, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look at me.

340
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,544
Look at me.
Look, look right here.

341
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,814
"Skeletons, masks, spiders."

342
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,516
Cheap motherfuckers bought
this shit at Party City

343
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:06,751
like two days ago.

344
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:09,220
Look. It's fake.

345
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,489
Fuck spiders.

346
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,061
Nope.

347
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,397
I'm not going in there.

348
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,665
This way.

349
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,539
Who's first?

350
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,008
Look at my face!

351
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,010
This is trippy.

352
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,846
Angela, look at this.
This is amazing.

353
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,616
Whoaaa.

354
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:41,218
That's so weird!

355
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,022
Huh. There's no gap
between the reflection.

356
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:48,859
- So?
- It's a two-way mirror.

357
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,462
My cousin Summer...
She's a criminal psychiatrist.

358
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:55,499
Cool.

359
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,638
I said I didn't want
to go in the tunnel.

360
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Yeah? Well, Harper, you
should have thought about that

361
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,842
before you got into a tunnel.

362
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,979
Oh, shit. Okay.

363
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:13,451
Uh, this way's a dead end,
so we got to go back.

364
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,820
Are you kidding? It is way
too tight to turn around.

365
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:17,621
You're just drunk. Come on.

366
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,291
Shuffle backwards.
We'll find a different way.

367
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:24,094
I'm gonna have so many splinters
when I get home.

368
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,464
Oh, guys, guys, I found it!

369
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:29,567
Stay close!
What the fuck does that mean?

370
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,135
It means stay close.

371
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:34,638
Okay. I'm following.
We're following.

372
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,481
Hey, guys, this way!

373
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:46,884
What was that?

374
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,705
Who's there?

375
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,125
Wait. Where's Mallory?

376
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:34,899
- Come on.
- Go ahead.

377
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:37,234
Pussies.

378
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,344
Oh, my God! Get it off me!

379
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,980
What is it? Brains!

380
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:51,815
Are you serious? Knew it.

381
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,050
Eww. Knew it.

382
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,052
Okay.

383
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,289
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

384
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,033
This is stressing me out.

385
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:14,538
It's not that bad. Okay.
Feels... small...

386
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,840
uh, round...

387
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,611
Ooh. Smooth.

388
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:25,583
It sounds like you're describing
Evan's scrotum.

389
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,518
That makes sense,
since we have a...

390
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,786
grape.

391
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:32,122
Do not... Ew!

392
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:34,592
Let's go.

393
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:36,927
Okay.

394
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,263
Fine.

395
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,578
I don't... Am I supposed
to be feeling something?

396
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,615
Uh... Push your arm further in.

397
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:04,788
Yeah, I'm not... This is...
This is not working.

398
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,526
Oh. Let's see.

399
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,836
Okay. No. I give up.

400
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:22,673
Nothing?

401
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,141
Fuck. My ring.

402
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,644
What ring?
Are you sure you had it on?

403
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:29,313
Yes, I'm positive.
It was Harper's mother's ring.

404
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,849
She's gonna kill me. Great.

405
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,117
Wait. I think I got it.

406
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,652
You got it?

407
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:35,986
Oh, no. Damn it!

408
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,755
Oh, shit! No! Damn it!

409
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,123
All right. No. I lost it.

410
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,591
We got to get it.
It's important to her.

411
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:41,959
We're gonna get it.
We're gonna get it.

412
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:43,460
Let's, um... All right. Find me.

413
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,162
Do you feel it? Mnh-mnh.

414
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
All right.
Let's see if we can find it.
- What?
- What the fuck was that?
- Did you feel that?
- No.
Something just fucking
touched me.

415
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:56,340
Can you not...
No. Something touched me.

416
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,641
Feel anything?

417
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,344
Someone's back there.

418
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,745
Listen.

419
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,551
Ugh! Ohh!

420
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:14,158
Oh, God! Oh, no!

421
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,959
Seriously, Nathan, get me
the fuck out of here!

422
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:18,495
Something's got me!
Ow, my arm! Ow!

423
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:30,074
Bailey?

424
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:33,644
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

425
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:35,646
Mallory!

426
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:37,414
Can you hear us?

427
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,756
Hey! Follow our voices.

428
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,728
Hey, I hear something.

429
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,262
Mal?

430
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:18,522
Hey. Um...
Our friend is still in there.

431
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

432
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,209
I think he wants us
to keep going.

433
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,313
Okay.

434
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,436
Nice.

435
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,488
I'll go first.

436
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,357
Sure.

437
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:11,969
Excuse me.

438
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,537
Have you seen our friend?

439
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,306
She's wearing a yellow dress.

440
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:17,207
Okay.

441
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:20,043
Okay. Okay.

442
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,579
Whoa! Ohh! Oh-ho-ho!

443
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:23,547
Okay. All right.

444
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,015
All right. Okay.

445
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:26,984
Okay. Come on. I get it.

446
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:28,719
All right.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

447
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,688
Get the fuck outta
my safe space, bro.

448
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,658
What the fuck is wrong with you?

449
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:47,604
Probably shouldn't have pushed him.
Yeah.

450
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:54,745
Wait, wait, wait!
Guys, don't close the door!

451
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,613
- Shit!
- Fuck!

452
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,082
Oh, shit. Bailey, what the
fuck happened to your arm?

453
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,450
It's okay. It doesn't...

454
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,386
- Doesn't hurt anymore.
- What's going on?

455
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:05,122
Guys, where's, um...
Where's Mallory?

456
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:07,124
Are we trapped?

457
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:28,445
Um... hello.

458
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,913
Hey. Hey. Excuse me.

459
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,548
Hey, excuse me.
Our friend is hurt in here,

460
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,917
and we need your help.

461
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,286
Hey, excuse me. We... We...
We have someone hurt in here.

462
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,621
Excuse me, ma'am?

463
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,256
- Hey.
- Ma'am?

464
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:41,224
Hey, ma'am, please,
we actually need your help.

465
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:43,226
Someone's fucking around here.

466
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,728
- Mallory?
- What's going on?

467
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,464
- Mallory, what are you doing?
- Mallory!

468
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,899
- Mallory!
- Mal!

469
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:51,969
Mallory, wake up!
Mallory, wake up!

470
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:28,372
Oh, my God!

471
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:31,808
Is she just acting?

472
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,210
Oh, my God.

473
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:35,846
What's happening?
What's happening?

474
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,693
- I want to go.
- Okay.

475
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:53,163
We need, um... We need a phone.

476
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:55,365
They're all in
the fucking lock box.

477
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:59,636
Oh. We need... We need...
We need the key.

478
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,571
Who has the key?

479
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,740
Please tell me Mallory
didn't have the fucking key.

480
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:07,577
Nathan.

481
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,713
Thank you, Bailey.

482
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,482
Hey, what are we gonna do?

483
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:15,085
We get to the lock box,
and we get our phones.

484
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:16,853
We can't go back
the same way we came.

485
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:20,157
I saw an exit.

486
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,858
Where?

487
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,895
Back that way.

488
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,396
What kind of exit?

489
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,166
Like an emergency exit.

490
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:30,734
Come here.

491
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:33,437
Hey, buddy, can you...
Can you do this?

492
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:34,538
Can you get that?

493
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,108
Um, yeah. I-I... Hairpins.

494
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,243
Hair... An-Angela.

495
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,750
Okay. We have three.
We have three.

496
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:54,391
Come on. Come on.

497
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,302
It's a two-way lock.

498
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:06,736
What happened to
"I can lock-pick anything"?

499
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,939
Yeah, I meant like anything
like a locker.

500
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,207
I'm an equipment manager.

501
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,408
I'm not Robert De Niro
from "Heat."

502
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,809
Okay. Hey, we just need you

503
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,144
to get through
the fucking lock, okay?

504
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:16,480
All right. Um...

505
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,283
So, what if we just went
a little bit further?

506
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,785
No, dude. No, listen. Listen.

507
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:24,387
I don't mean all of us.
You know, just you and me.

508
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:27,824
We go a little bit further,
and, uh, you know,

509
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,760
we find something like a...
Like a crowbar, you know,

510
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,997
so we can break off the hinges.

511
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,633
Okay. Fuck. I'll go.

512
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,401
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go.

513
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:45,642
I'm gonna go. Just...
Just... Okay.

514
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,873
They have everything...
Our addresses,

515
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,176
our parents' names.

516
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,848
Evan?

517
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,882
Evan, what are you doing?

518
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,350
She's gone.

519
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,785
There must be, like, a trap door

520
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,487
on the other side or something.

521
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:32,889
No, just leave it.
You don't want to piss them off.

522
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:34,291
One sec.

523
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:35,759
Evan, don't.

524
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,529
Hey. Hey, hey.

525
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,032
Come here.

526
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,633
Come here.

527
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,302
Okay.

528
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:49,306
Can you reach your arm
through the fence?

529
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:50,740
What?

530
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:53,143
There's a metal poker thing
right there.

531
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:56,046
My arm's too big.
I can't reach it.

532
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,647
So what?

533
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:00,417
So we can use it to break
the hinges off the door.

534
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:02,185
Come on.

535
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:04,221
Okay. Come on.

536
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:05,889
Okay, okay.

537
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,390
Okay.

538
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

539
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,244
Hey!

540
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:35,779
Hey, please!
Somebody's hurt back here!

541
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:36,980
Hey!

542
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:39,082
Hey!

543
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,726
You say you need help?

544
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,764
Yeah.

545
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,373
Hold on.

546
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,177
I told all my friends
I would come right back.

547
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,478
They're right...
Right back there,

548
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,113
in, um, the room with the fence.

549
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:12,949
So, do you think you could
come back with me?

550
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:20,890
Let me get something.

551
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,932
I'm really sorry, Harper.

552
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,872
For what?

553
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,879
I lost your mom's ring.

554
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:48,218
I was reaching through, and I
lost it in the haunted house.

555
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,487
It's okay.

556
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,928
I grew up in a haunted house.

557
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:05,168
I loved that house.

558
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,470
I hated it at the same time.

559
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:15,512
It's where my dad
would read to me...

560
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,650
where he taught me
how to ride a bike.

561
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,658
It's where he hurt my mom.

562
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,432
I would go upstairs to my room,

563
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,367
and I would hide under the bed.

564
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,272
And one day,
while I was hiding, he...

565
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,878
threw my mom across the floor

566
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,449
like it was nothing, like...

567
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:55,952
that's how it's supposed to be.

568
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:59,389
I haven't been home
in four years.

569
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:03,893
But I have
this recurring dream where...

570
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:08,465
I go back
and knock at the door...

571
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:13,236
terrified that my dad's
gonna answer.

572
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,975
But my mom comes out.

573
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:25,915
She tells me he's gone forever.

574
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:32,489
She tells me the house
isn't haunted anymore.

575
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,092
Come on. You almost
got it. You almost got it.

576
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:38,528
Oh. I have to take a break.

577
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,531
Okay. It's right there.

578
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,633
It's right there. Okay.

579
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:45,101
Okay. You good?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

580
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:48,338
All right.

581
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,040
I have to get my shoulder.
There. There.

582
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,776
All right. A little to the left.
A little bit to the left.

583
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,178
Okay. You're right there.

584
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,813
It's right there.

585
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I feel like my cousin Elina.
She's a proctologist.
How many fucking cousins
do you have?

586
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:07,156
46.

587
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:08,625
Okay.

588
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:10,860
Almost got it.

589
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,462
Got it. I got it.

590
00:42:12,464 --> 00:42:15,298
Okay. Okay.

591
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,500
Com on. You're almost there.

592
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:29,145
My hand!

593
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:32,215
What's going on?

594
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,183
Holy shit. Is she bleeding?

595
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:36,553
Angela?
What happened to your hand?

596
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:38,154
Oh, we got to get her out.

597
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:39,722
Yeah, what the fuck's
it look like I'm doing?

598
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:43,059
I have keys, man.

599
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,827
Where?

600
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:47,230
I'm sorry, girls. This...
This isn't supposed to happen.

601
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:50,733
Hey, look, man, we just
want to go, okay?

602
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,369
I don't need to talk
to your manager.

603
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,338
None of us do.

604
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,040
We haven't seen anything.

605
00:42:57,042 --> 00:43:00,009
Nothing happened.

606
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:02,278
We just want to leave.

607
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:08,685
We're gonna get out.

608
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,497
Watch out.

609
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:25,768
The exit was this way.

610
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:33,209
Over here.

611
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,477
Fuck! I fucking knew it!

612
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,713
Read the door, idiot.

613
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:49,225
That makes sense.

614
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,127
I didn't remember there being
an exit there.

615
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:54,263
So, why wouldn't
you say something?!

616
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:57,567
Why don't we just crawl back
through the tunnel?

617
00:43:57,569 --> 00:44:00,169
Well, if you want to, but you
can only go one at a time.

618
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,971
There's a trap door
in the tunnel

619
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,073
that gets triggered if there's
too many people in there.

620
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:07,343
Okay, why is there
a trap door in your tunnel?

621
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:09,946
We use it to capture people
and put them on the show.

622
00:44:09,948 --> 00:44:11,347
There's this whole thing
with a witch...

623
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,616
Yeah. We know about
your fucking show.

624
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:16,085
One of our friends is dead
because of your fucking show.

625
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:17,754
She's not dead.

626
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:19,322
She's outside waiting
on you guys,

627
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:20,757
probably wondering
what's going on.

628
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,158
What?

629
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,262
Look, we're a little
extreme here,

630
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:28,831
but safety is a huge priority.

631
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,466
Don't you talk to me
about fucking safety.

632
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:33,770
Don't you talk to me
about fucking safety!

633
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:37,206
What's your name?

634
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,274
What's your fucking name?!

635
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:42,612
Sir, my name's Harper, okay?

636
00:44:42,614 --> 00:44:44,180
We really appreciate your help,

637
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:48,017
but could you please
just tell us who you are?

638
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:51,187
You can call me "Mitch."

639
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,456
Thanks, Mitch.

640
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:58,961
What's your last name, Mitch?

641
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:11,174
Okay, Mitch.

642
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:14,877
I think we would feel a lot
more fucking comfortable

643
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,212
if you took off
that fucking mask...

644
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,647
Yeah, lose the mask.

645
00:45:17,649 --> 00:45:19,415
And you told us
what your real name was.

646
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,051
I don't care which way you go,

647
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,853
but you're almost
at the end of the haunted house.

648
00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:25,655
It's probably farther
if you go backwards.

649
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:27,056
Yeah, I think we made it
pretty clear, Mitch.

650
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,157
We don't want to go that way.

651
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,425
'Kay. Wait, wait, wait.

652
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:31,227
Why don't we just,
one at a time,

653
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,762
go back through the tunnel?

654
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:34,564
You really want to
go back in there?

655
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,365
I just want to get out of here.

656
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:39,235
Okay. All right.
Here's the plan.

657
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:42,238
I sort of remember my way
around the maze.

658
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,373
I'll take the lock box key,
I'll go through,

659
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,942
I'll book it to the front,

660
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:48,010
I'll get our phones,
and I'll call for help.

661
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:49,979
Nate, let me get the key.

662
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,417
I dropped it.

663
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:56,919
Well, that is
just perfect, Nate.

664
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,522
Fuck the key.
I can pick the lock box.

665
00:45:59,524 --> 00:46:01,290
All right, so, I'll go first.

666
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:02,892
Then we send Bitch through,
and he can just chill

667
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:04,393
on the other side
and wait for everyone else.

668
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:05,928
Then, Nate, you go.

669
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,363
Follow him with the poker,
you know, in case

670
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:09,298
Mitch here forgets
whose team he's on.

671
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,868
And then Bailey and Angela,
'cause they need the most help.

672
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,605
And last goes Harper.

673
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:20,209
One thing first.

674
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:22,378
I want your keys.

675
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,986
What key is it?

676
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,689
Yellow, obviously.

677
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:32,548
- I'm through!
- Okay, there it is.

678
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:35,318
Let's go. You're up.

679
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,453
Go.

680
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,458
Think, think, think,
think, think.

681
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,827
Um... safe or not safe?

682
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:46,162
Safe or not safe?

683
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:47,363
Okay.

684
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:50,167
Fuck!

685
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,569
Damn it.

686
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:19,729
Okay.

687
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:22,064
What's taking so fucking long?

688
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:33,676
I'm here!

689
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:35,711
Finally.

690
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:21,390
Fuck.

691
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:36,172
No.

692
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
What the fuck?

693
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,270
Run.

694
00:50:08,272 --> 00:50:09,805
No. We have to wait
for Nathan's signal.

695
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:12,975
- Nathan, hurry up!
- Run!

696
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:15,378
No! We have to wait or he's
gonna fall through the trap!

697
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,846
Run!

698
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:18,447
Run!

699
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:22,518
Don't go! Don't go!

700
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:25,121
No! No!

701
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:26,956
Get in there. Come on! Let's go!
Come on! You can do it!

702
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:28,691
Get in! Get in! Get in! Get in!

703
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:31,861
Oh, my God!

704
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:19,608
Who's there?

705
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,043
Nathan?

706
00:51:21,045 --> 00:51:23,579
I'm at a dead end!
We have to go back!

707
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,181
No, which way?

708
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:30,086
Go... Nathan?

709
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:32,054
Nathan, are you there?

710
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:00,950
What the fuck?

711
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:03,719
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Where is it? Where is it?

712
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:47,263
Where is everybody?

713
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:49,231
They're right behind me.

714
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:56,672
Where are our phones?

715
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,440
Someone's bringing 'em.

716
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:42,151
Please.

717
00:53:42,153 --> 00:53:46,055
Please. Please don't hurt me.

718
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:47,590
Please.

719
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:49,825
Please don't hurt me, Sam.

720
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:25,761
Who's Sam?

721
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:33,736
Hello?

722
00:54:33,738 --> 00:54:36,772
<i>Hey, man, who the fuck is this?</i>

723
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,875
Who're you trying to reach?

724
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:42,378
<i>I'm trying to reach Harper.</i>

725
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,814
<i>This is her boyfriend, Sam.</i>

726
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:48,984
<i>Hello?</i>

727
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:50,886
You're too late, Sam.

728
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:52,788
<i>All right, listen,
you little fuckin...</i>

729
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:31,293
Such a pretty mask.

730
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,336
Why don't we take it off...

731
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:43,105
and find out who you really are?

732
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:48,811
Run, Harper!

733
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:02,858
Where is everybody?

734
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,328
They should have been
out by now.

735
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:09,264
Do you still want
to see my face?

736
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:14,136
What?

737
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:18,540
Do you still want
to see my face?

738
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:24,980
It's whatever, man. I'm fine.

739
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:27,249
Oh, why not?

740
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:32,087
I just want to go home.

741
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:37,025
2425 Lincoln Road?

742
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:38,594
What?

743
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:42,564
Because before, you said
you wanted to see my face,

744
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:48,237
and I was just wondering if
you still wanted to see it.

745
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:51,540
It's a bit of a work
in progress, but,

746
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:54,710
oh, I think you'll like it.

747
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:22,130
Shit.

748
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:56,778
Hello?

749
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:08,323
Who's there?

750
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,627
Aaah!

751
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:43,024
Where are my friends?

752
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:45,327
Can you tell me where they are?

753
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:54,703
I just want to know if
my friends are still alive.

754
01:02:54,705 --> 01:02:59,241
I just need to know...
and we're cool.

755
01:02:59,243 --> 01:03:02,377
And I-I just...

756
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:41,903
"Find the key to
escape the haunt."

757
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:02,891
Fuck.

758
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:32,520
Dolls?

759
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:09,958
"Something is hiding
under the bed."

760
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

761
01:09:03,406 --> 01:09:06,407
No, no, no, no, no, no.

762
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:21,589
Harper, where are you hiding?

763
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:33,168
Sweetie, look, uh...
Look, Mommy's fine.

764
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:41,776
Adults...
do stupid things sometimes.

765
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:44,045
Okay.

766
01:09:47,317 --> 01:09:50,685
You never have to hide
from me, okay?

767
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:53,021
I'm sorry.

768
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:59,194
Harper, tell me a story
about why you're sad.

769
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:01,529
Do you think I'm sad?

770
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:04,899
I grew up in a haunted house.

771
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:09,971
Come out.

772
01:10:14,578 --> 01:10:16,878
Let's take off your mask.

773
01:10:18,148 --> 01:10:19,247
No.

774
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:30,425
Oh, fuck!

775
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on.

776
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
My eye!

777
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:28,516
Aah! My fucking eye!

778
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:04,806
You ready?

779
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:48,916
No. No, no.

780
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:53,754
Oh, Bailey.

781
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:57,091
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

782
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:07,101
They're coming for you.

783
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:10,671
They're coming for you.
They're coming for you!

784
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:16,511
Bailey.

785
01:15:22,886 --> 01:15:25,286
No, no, no.

786
01:15:26,623 --> 01:15:33,060
Bailey...

787
01:16:25,048 --> 01:16:28,416
Hello?

788
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:31,085
Hey, uh, look,
I'm looking for somebody.

789
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:35,856
Hey, man, I said
I'm looking for s...

790
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:11,519
Harper.

791
01:18:11,521 --> 01:18:12,887
Nathan?

792
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:14,355
Back up.

793
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:16,957
Someone's coming.

794
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:18,359
Nathan!

795
01:18:57,834 --> 01:18:59,500
Come on.

796
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:05,840
You still want to know my name?

797
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:23,691
This way. This way.

798
01:19:32,235 --> 01:19:34,068
Harper.

799
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:35,469
Come on.

800
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:49,316
Look.

801
01:19:49,318 --> 01:19:50,584
I didn't kill anyone, okay?

802
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:54,655
I-I was just helping out.

803
01:19:54,657 --> 01:19:56,824
I'm sorry.

804
01:19:56,826 --> 01:19:58,559
Look.

805
01:20:01,998 --> 01:20:04,064
This is so fucked up.

806
01:20:05,434 --> 01:20:07,601
They... They didn't tell me
it was gonna be real.

807
01:20:07,603 --> 01:20:09,470
I thought, you know,

808
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:10,838
"Sure, we'll mess
with some kids,"

809
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,140
but then they started
killing them.

810
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:17,978
And then they said if...
If I killed someone,

811
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,713
that I would earn my face.

812
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:23,117
I'm just their errands guy,
you know?

813
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:26,654
I-I buy shit for them.
That's it.

814
01:20:26,656 --> 01:20:29,089
We... We can go to the cops.

815
01:20:29,091 --> 01:20:31,258
I don't... I don't know
their names, but one of them...

816
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,194
One of them
is a-a tattoo artist,

817
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
and the other one, he's...
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

818
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:44,839
It's fine, it's fine.

819
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:47,875
Look, you're making
too much noise.

820
01:20:47,877 --> 01:20:49,610
It's fine.
I know where they hide a gun.

821
01:20:49,612 --> 01:20:52,112
I don't care.
We don't need it. Let's go.

822
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:55,649
That's weird.

823
01:20:55,651 --> 01:20:56,684
It used to be right he...

824
01:21:25,982 --> 01:21:29,149
Think you're the only one
who's made it this far?

825
01:21:38,661 --> 01:21:40,227
Harper!

826
01:21:58,114 --> 01:22:00,047
Come on.

827
01:22:34,317 --> 01:22:35,382
Keys.

828
01:22:35,384 --> 01:22:37,184
Keys, keys.

829
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:43,324
Nathan.

830
01:22:43,326 --> 01:22:45,793
Let's go. Let's go.

831
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:47,761
Let's go.

832
01:23:59,902 --> 01:24:03,070
Okay. Okay.

833
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

834
01:26:35,658 --> 01:26:39,193
Hey, hon. Sorry to bother you.

835
01:26:39,195 --> 01:26:43,530
Your friend is doing just fine.
He's in the next room.

836
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:46,200
Just have a couple of release
forms I need you to sign.

837
01:27:50,733 --> 01:27:52,366
Fuck!

838
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:57,237
Aah!

839
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:16,123
Let's take off your mask.
