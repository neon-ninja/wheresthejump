1
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,700
Oh, fuck!

2
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,455
I wasn't trying to escape.

3
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,788
No, please. Don't.

4
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,907
Oh, God. I don't want to die.

5
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,104
Yeah. Yeah, I'll make you clean.

6
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,286
I'm sorry.

7
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,122
I didn't mean to...

8
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

9
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,709
Hey, sis.

10
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,907
What time is it?

11
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,643
Just after 8:00.

12
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,010
You want me to make coffee?

13
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,679
No, I gotta go. I'll call you later.

14
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,179
You sure there's nothing I can do?

15
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,818
Angie, everything's gonna be fine.
Just go back to sleep.

16
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,402
<i>All right, I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

17
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,774
Ben Carson.

18
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:03,043
Lorenzo Sapelli. I've been waiting for you.
Come on in.

19
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,105
Thanks.

20
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,290
How long you been working here?

21
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:16,158
All together? Fifteen years.

22
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,462
You were here for the fire?

23
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,931
Devastating.

24
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,403
Entire building up in flames.

25
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,011
It has been five years since the fire.

26
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,816
They're still in a legal battle
with the insurance companies.

27
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:46,347
Even cleaning up this mess is impossible.

28
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,589
I've given up faith about reopening,
and besides,

29
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:53,564
who'd ever want to shop here
after everything that's happened?

30
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,436
You know, the Meredith family
acquired this building

31
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:01,098
after St. Matthew's Hospital
closed in 1952.

32
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:05,505
It was the very first Mayflower
to open on the East Coast.

33
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:11,873
Yeah, the company wants us to patrol
the premises every couple of hours,

34
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,785
but I do my rounds every three.
That's more than enough.

35
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:20,690
Anyway, you'll see, not too much
going on. It's pretty calm around here.

36
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,657
Well, there you go.

37
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,131
Perfume and cosmetics department,
what's left of it anyway.

38
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:40,271
Thank God you didn't show up any later.
This place gives me the creeps at night.

39
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,904
No electricity.

40
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,577
All these mirrors.

41
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,887
- Best to keep your eyes away from them.
- You polish them?

42
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:52,089
- I'm sorry?
- The mirrors, they're so clean.

43
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,218
No, that's Gary. Gary Lewis.

44
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,728
Fellow who was working here before you.

45
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,265
He was completely obsessed
with these damn mirrors.

46
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,733
Spent the entire night cleaning them.

47
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,539
How long has it been
since you left the NYPD?

48
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,873
About a year.

49
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:16,574
I know it's none of my business,
but why did you resign from the force?

50
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:20,452
You used to be a detective,
is that correct?

51
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,147
Yeah.

52
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,483
I'm sorry.

53
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,855
I always been too curious.

54
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,450
It's all right.

55
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,398
There was a pretty big team
working here before the fire.

56
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,603
You know, when you stop to think,
of all the department stores in New York,

57
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,113
this one was the most beautiful,
most luxurious.

58
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,108
I mean, it breaks your heart, it really does.

59
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,648
Well, here you go.

60
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,017
This is where you'll be spending
most of your time.

61
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,923
At least you got electricity in here.

62
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,427
It's warm. It's nice.

63
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,929
You've even got a TV.

64
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,374
<i>I opened up the trunk,
which he so called hid the pictures.</i>

65
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,315
<i>I grabbed the goody bag,
walked to the backyard,</i>

66
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:29,445
<i>opened up the barbecue grill,
I grabbed the lighter fluid,</i>

67
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,251
Waiting to Exhale.

68
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,756
Hello?

69
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:35,985
Hello.

70
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,031
- Hey, Rosa, how are you doing?
- I'm fine. Let me help you.

71
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,463
Thanks.

72
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,760
Where are the kids?

73
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,429
<i>Upstairs with Señor Ben.</i>

74
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,734
Thanks.

75
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:52,437
So everybody at my school
thinks this boy named Eamon,

76
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:57,005
which is, like, one of my best friends,
which is a boy, likes me.

77
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:01,577
And this girl named Christiana,
who liked him, is just now gossiping.

78
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,019
You want me to talk to Mrs. Ward?

79
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,788
She'll make them want to wrap me up
in toilet paper for Halloween.

80
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,657
- Hey.
- Hey.

81
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,924
Look, Mommy. Look what Daddy got me.

82
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:15,092
It looks great. You'll have to show me
how it works later, okay?

83
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,431
It's so fast, Mommy.

84
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,664
Ben? Can I talk to you?

85
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,667
Yeah. Okay, you two.

86
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,041
You need to finish your homework.
You need to get ready for your bath.

87
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,602
Come on. No fooling around, let's go.

88
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,705
Okay, let's go, Michael.

89
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,377
Hey. Come here.

90
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,148
Happy, happy birthday.

91
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,019
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

92
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,948
- Hey.
- Hey.

93
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,771
- What is this?
- What?

94
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,310
I've asked you
not to drop by without calling.

95
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,743
You won't answer my calls.

96
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,246
Please, Ben,
I don't want to argue with you.

97
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,715
I don't want to argue, either. If you're not
gonna answer my calls, what...

98
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,546
I haven't had a drink
for over three months,

99
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,887
but since you won't answer your calls,
how would you know?

100
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,550
I don't want to know.

101
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,658
What I want is for you
to respect my needs.

102
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,323
Amy, I'm doing everything I can
to respect your needs.

103
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,457
I haven't had a drink.

104
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,900
I got a new job to hold me over
till I'm reinstated.

105
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,496
I'm doing everything I can
to get back on my feet again.

106
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,339
What?

107
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,276
You don't think people can change?

108
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,873
We're not talking about people.
We're talking about you.

109
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,941
Amy, I killed a man.

110
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,714
You don't just get over that.

111
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,756
I needed time. I needed you.

112
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,724
- I was right here.
- Yeah.

113
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,259
Judging me like everybody else.

114
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,488
How dare you say that to me?

115
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,031
I was the only one at the precinct
who defended you.

116
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:56,364
How many times did I chase reporters
off our front lawn?

117
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,960
How can you say that to me?

118
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,232
I've always been in your corner!

119
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,206
I've been the only one
who believed in you!

120
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,105
You're fucking unbelievable!

121
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,144
Please, I didn't come here to fight.

122
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,511
Look, I'm sorry that I came over
without calling.

123
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,846
I just wanted to see them.

124
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,146
But we have to set up some rules.

125
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,154
What fucking rules?

126
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,782
Come on, Amy,
just tell me what rules I need to follow

127
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,452
so I can see my son on his birthday!

128
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,718
Look at yourself.

129
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,928
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

130
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,096
I don't know how you're going to be
from one moment to the next.

131
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:36,733
When I get around you, I get nervous.

132
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,835
Because I am so scared
that I am losing you.

133
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,672
And I screw everything up.

134
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,846
- I've missed you so much.
- I miss you, too.

135
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,621
Amy, we deserve another chance.

136
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,423
I know how much I love you, and I know
somewhere inside there, you love me, too.

137
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,091
Please.

138
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,133
Please.

139
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,109
I can't do this.

140
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,481
I can't do this, Ben.

141
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,616
Fuck.

142
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

143
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,401
Holy shit.

144
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,852
What the hell?

145
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,307
Fuck!

146
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,747
Man.

147
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,487
What the...

148
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,639
- You should stop taking those pills.
- Jesus!

149
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,537
How are you doing today?

150
00:21:56,548 --> 00:22:00,712
I'm fine. I feel a lot better.
I'm leaving in a couple of minutes.

151
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,945
Are you sure you're all right?

152
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,216
Please, not you.

153
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,418
Okay. I'm just saying,
you can talk to me if you want.

154
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,358
I'm your little sister.

155
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,754
It's that new job, isn't it?

156
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,460
Yeah, well, I need that new job.

157
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:20,631
I can't take care of Amy and the kids
and myself on my pension.

158
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,005
I'm not gonna sleep on your couch
for the rest of my life.

159
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:28,740
Okay, well, maybe you get a daytime job,
a regular job.

160
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,577
It's not that simple.

161
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,482
Well, you should think about it.

162
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Ben! What happened?

163
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,498
Just leave me alone.
Please, just leave me alone!

164
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,664
Angie, get out of here! Now!

165
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,659
What is happening to you, Ben?

166
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,567
Pull yourself together.

167
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

168
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

169
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:20,971
Help!

170
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,380
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my...

171
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,817
No!

172
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,217
"Gary Lewis."

173
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,720
Esseker.

174
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,618
Esseker.

175
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

176
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,246
Hello?

177
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,849
Hello?

178
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:26,023
Where are you?

179
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:29,424
I want to help you,
but I need to know where you are!

180
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,859
Damn it!

181
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,532
I'm coming!

182
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,393
Anybody here?

183
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,624
Is anybody in here?

184
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,186
Fuck this place.

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

186
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,670
Mom! Mom! Mom!

187
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,298
- Mom! Mom!
- Michael?

188
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,036
Are you okay? What's happening?

189
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,635
Michael. What's the matter, sweetie?

190
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,507
- There's a lady screaming.
- Where?

191
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:41,074
- There, in the mirror.
- In the mirror?

192
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,682
I don't see anybody
but you and I in the mirror.

193
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,053
- You just had a nightmare, sweetie.
- Okay.

194
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,422
Sometimes they can feel really real,
but they're not, all right?

195
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,586
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go back to sleep.

196
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:53,290
Come on. In you go.

197
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,162
I'm right around the corner, all right?

198
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,032
- Love you.
- I love you, too, sweetie.

199
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,608
- Can you leave the door open?
- Sure, sweetheart.

200
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:07,907
- But you go back to sleep, okay?
- All right, Mom.

201
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,742
<i>... not clear how it happened.</i>

209
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,052
I swear to you,
I could feel my flesh burning.

210
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,325
I couldn't breathe.
It was like my lungs were full of smoke.

211
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:04,164
It was like a nightmare, but I was awake.
I know I was awake.

212
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,872
- You think I'm crazy, don't you?
- I don't know what to think.

213
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,965
I think you're just going through
a hard time in your life.

214
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,203
You're under a lot of stress.

215
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,769
You've been having those nightmares
since the shooting.

216
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,617
- You know it wasn't your fault.
- They're everywhere.

217
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,947
- What are you talking about?
- The fucking mirrors, they are everywhere,

218
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:29,823
in the department store,
on the corner of every street,

219
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,795
in the window of every building
in this city.

220
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,354
I feel...

221
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:40,267
I feel like I'm not the one
looking into the mirrors

222
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,670
but they're looking back at me.

223
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,835
There's no one looking back at you
through the mirrors.

224
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:53,043
You're obviously... You're still conflicted
about what happened.

225
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,247
Maybe you need to talk to someone.

226
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,515
A professional, someone...

227
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,689
Mirrors are just glass and silver, Ben.
That's it.

228
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,755
There's nothing behind them.

229
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:13,968
Will you please go get some sleep, okay?

230
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,506
I love you.

231
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,520
Coming!

232
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,224
Hold on!

233
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,364
- Mr. Carson?
- Yeah.

234
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,770
You want to sign here, please?

235
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,345
- You have a good day, sir.
- Thanks.

236
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,123
Holy shit.

237
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,887
Lorenzo, I need to talk to you.

238
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,867
I just had the craziest day here.
Your ex-colleagues came to pay us a visit.

239
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:25,994
What are you talking about?

240
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,538
Well, you know Gary, the guy
who was working here before you?

241
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:29,664
Yeah.

242
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,903
Cops found him dead
in a subway station in Harlem.

243
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,538
I never liked him too much, but,
poor guy, he didn't deserve to go like that.

244
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,275
Did they happen to tell you
the cause of death?

245
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,214
- What?
- Did they tell you how he died?

246
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,115
No, no, they wouldn't tell me.

247
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,087
Mrs. Sapelli is waiting for me at home.
I got to go.

248
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,386
By the way,
about that leak in the basement.

249
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:51,758
They're sending someone over
to work on that, beginning of next week.

250
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:24,622
We have a white male, 50 years of age,
name unknown.

251
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,931
Following the completion
of the external examination,

252
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,559
the body was washed and lightly dried.

253
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:34,401
A Y-incision was made
from the bilateral clavicular joints

254
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,599
to the xiphoid process.

255
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,199
- The tissue was waterlogged...
- Amy.

256
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:40,539
Yes, what is it?

257
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:44,103
There's someone in the lobby for you.
It sounds urgent.

258
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:53,919
Ben.

259
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,322
What's happening?
What are you doing here?

260
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,226
Thanks for seeing me.
Look, I need to ask you a favor.

261
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:00,924
- I'm in the middle of work.
- I know. Twenty minutes.

262
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,193
Yesterday morning you picked up a body.

263
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:06,327
Gary Lewis.
I just need to take a look at him.

264
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,101
- Who is he?
- He was a night watchman

265
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,470
at the Mayflower. I replaced him.

266
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,008
How do you have his driver's license?

267
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:16,069
I found his wallet in the department store.
Look, I just need to know how he died.

268
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,849
Why do you need to know how he died?

269
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,680
Ben, you've been suspended. You're not
supposed to be doing any investigations.

270
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,811
Amy, please, just listen to me.
This is serious.

271
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,789
There are some very strange things
happening over at the Mayflower.

272
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,984
I can't explain, but it's...

273
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:33,096
This guy Gary Lewis sent me a package
right before he died.

274
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,132
Thing is, I never met him before.

275
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,362
Inside the package were all these articles
on the Mayflower, on the fire.

276
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:42,065
It was like he was trying to tell me
something or warn me about something.

277
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,334
I need to figure this out. Please.

278
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:48,071
Gary Lewis, Gary Lewis. There he is, B-16.

279
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,941
He slashed his throat.

280
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:53,347
There you go, there's your answer.
Your man committed suicide.

281
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:58,047
And you get a lot of suicide cases
with people that slash their own throats?

282
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,948
I didn't think so. Excuse me.

283
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:05,325
All I know is,
the police are still investigating this one.

284
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,693
That's why we still have the body.

285
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,289
What did he use to cut his throat?

286
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,198
A piece of mirror.

287
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,367
He probably broke the mirror into pieces

288
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:17,100
so he'd have something
to cut himself with.

289
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Seven years bad luck.
Esseker.
Are you okay, Ben?

290
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,480
I'm fine.

291
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,421
I'm sorry, excuse me.

292
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,559
I need to see his file.

293
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,492
- What?
- I need his file.

294
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:39,586
- Ben.
- What's the problem?

295
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,721
I just need to see his file.

296
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,629
Calm down. You're not even
supposed to be down here,

297
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,964
and now you want to
look at somebody's file?

298
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,866
Look, I'll be off then.

299
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,167
Amy, you know where to find me
if you need me.

300
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,868
Yeah. Thanks, Peter. I appreciate it.

301
00:41:57,114 --> 00:42:00,948
- I want you to leave now. I'm serious, Ben.
- Amy, I'm sorry.

302
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,116
I can't leave here until I see that file.

303
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,681
It's important, please.

304
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,355
Please.

305
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:40,684
Amy, come here and look at this picture.

306
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,886
Look at the piece of mirror
that Gary Lewis is holding.

307
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:51,025
And look at it up here
in its reflected image in the other mirror.

308
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,933
It's full of blood.

309
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:57,963
Yet in reality, it's perfectly clean.
Not a single drop, not a single drop on it.

310
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:00,476
So what? It's probably the angle
from which the photograph was taken.

311
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:02,569
What are you trying to prove?

312
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:05,479
What if the mirrors are showing us
something that's not really happening?

313
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:08,211
- What are you talking about?
- No, just listen to me.

314
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:13,086
What if the mirrors are reflecting
something that's beyond our reality?

315
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,751
What if the mirrors can actually make us
do things that we don't want to do?

316
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,521
Like making Gary Lewis
slit his own throat.

317
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:21,429
Ben, listen to yourself.
You can't talk like that around here.

318
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:23,660
Don't you want to get reinstated?

319
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:27,568
Amy, I'm seeing things in the mirrors
at work, bad things,

320
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:29,868
to the point where I can feel
what they're showing me.

321
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,740
Ben, you're driving me fucking crazy!
I don't have time for this.

322
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:34,937
What's wrong with you?

323
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,914
Do you think I'm making this up?
Do you think I'm fucking lying?

324
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,718
What medication are you taking
to stop drinking?

325
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,203
That's a strong drug.

326
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:08,302
It has a lot of serious side effects.
How many pills are you taking a day?

327
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,181
I'm sorry that I bothered you.

328
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,385
You're right.

329
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,680
Thanks for trying to help.

330
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:29,978
...night at this bar.
It's a couple of blocks from here.

331
00:46:30,054 --> 00:46:32,215
- All right. Where's the body?
- Calm down.

332
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,951
- I can't. How am I gonna calm down?
- Let the detective by. Step over here.

333
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,926
And there's a guy been living with her
at her place. There's a guy.

334
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:41,556
All right. You say she works at this bar?
At night?

335
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,623
Yeah, she works nights. She goes nights.

336
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:46,033
She comes home late.
I don't see her come home.

337
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,627
She probably closes the bar, right?

338
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:51,266
Yeah. 'Cause she sleeps during the day,
like early morning hours.

339
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:52,706
All right.

340
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:23,031
I saw blood falling from the ceiling.
Then she call me.

341
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:26,474
I want you to ask her,
did she hear any noises, any sounds?

342
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:27,737
- What's going on?
- One second.

343
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:30,507
It's all right, I live in apartment eight.
I used to be a cop.

344
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:33,141
- Just tell me what's going on.
- Just a second.

345
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:36,277
I want to talk to the lead detective!
Angela!

346
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,379
- Who is the lead detective?
- Ben.

347
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,554
Larry, what the hell are you doing here?

348
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:46,854
- Larry, just tell me what's going on.
- Ben, it's not good.

349
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,557
Where's Angie?

350
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:53,428
Where the fuck is my sister?
Tell them to let go of me!

351
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:55,904
- I can't do that, Ben!
- God damn it!

352
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,349
<i>The water has obliterated
most of the marks.</i>

353
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,452
No sign of struggle or forced entry.

354
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:49,357
And the front door was locked,
which means that

355
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,519
the person who did this
either had keys to the apartment

356
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,825
or it was someone that she knew.

357
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,593
He would've never laid a finger on her.

358
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:01,064
You know, when their father died,
Ben took care of Angela.

359
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:04,565
She meant the world to him.

360
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:08,600
Listen, so far, his statement is pretty
consistent with the facts, you know?

361
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,671
We checked it out.
He showed up to work at 7:00 p.m.

362
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:12,976
And the downstairs neighbors said

363
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,247
they began to notice the water leakage
at around 10:00.

364
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,380
The only strange thing,
and this could just be a coincidence,

365
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:23,392
is that Ben told the daytime
security guard, Lorenzo Sapelli,

366
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,224
that he was planning on quitting the job.

367
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:30,960
Like he was moving away someplace.
He mention anything like that to you?

368
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,194
No.

369
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:36,870
Lately, communication hasn't been
our strong point.

370
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,702
What are you gonna do with him?

371
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:40,766
I figure we'll let him go.
We got no reason to keep him here.

372
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,175
Larry.

373
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,686
I'm so sorry.

374
00:49:58,262 --> 00:49:59,786
Ben?

375
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:02,798
Why don't you come home
and spend some days with the kids?

376
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,390
I can't.

377
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:08,171
I don't want to put our children in danger.

378
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,766
She asked me to quit, but I wouldn't.

379
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:16,944
- They came after her.
- What are you talking about?

380
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:22,512
I've got some things I need to take care of.

381
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:25,714
- Wait, Ben. Please.
- Amy. Amy, let me go.

382
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,279
I don't want you
to get in any more trouble.

383
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,884
- Please stay out of it.
- I know who did this.

384
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:34,522
Well, in that case,
you've got to tell Larry everything.

385
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,091
He'll never believe me.

386
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,465
Neither will you.

387
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,646
What do you want?

388
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:08,588
Please, just tell me.

389
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,522
What do you want from me?

390
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,901
What do you want from me?

391
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:41,448
"Esseker."

392
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:49,960
Hey. I need you to run a name for me.
Esseker.

393
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:54,902
Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo,
Kilo, Echo, Romeo.

394
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:58,463
<i>- Did you check online?
- I've already done that.</i>

395
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:01,102
Nothing. IRS and DMV.

396
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,043
<i>- Where?
- Try New York.</i>

397
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:04,740
<i>- When?
- Last five or six years.</i>

398
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,146
<i>Okay, Ben.</i>

399
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,741
Thanks.
Get back to me as soon as you can.

400
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:13,421
"Mayflower burns, 48 presumed dead."

401
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:18,423
"Berry confesses to
deadly Mayflower fire."

402
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,701
"Watchman arrested."

403
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,638
"Woman, three children murdered."
Come on, Ben, connect the dots.

404
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,972
"Mr. Berry maintains that
the mirrors in the store are the ones

405
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,207
"that brutally killed his wife
and three children."

406
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,281
"Mirrors are guilty. Mirrors are guilty."

407
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,479
<i>- Yeah. What did you get?
- Hey.</i>

408
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,390
<i>Look, I didn't find anything
under that name.</i>

409
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,054
Shit! Shit.

410
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,690
<i>Do you want me
to look outside New York?</i>

411
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:58,359
No. Hold on. Hold on.

412
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:05,833
I want you to run another name for me.
Berry, Terrence Berry.

413
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,377
<i>Terrence Berry.</i>

414
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:10,540
<i>Wait one sec.</i>

415
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:17,275
<i>- I think I got him. You still there?
- Yeah.</i>

416
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,546
<i>- Your guy murdered his whole family.
- I already know that.</i>

417
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,024
<i>He's dead.</i>

418
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,892
Damn it.

419
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,464
Can you tell me where he was committed
before he died?

420
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:36,702
You know, Mr. Carson, when one
starts to perceive one's own reflection

421
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,638
as a completely separate being,

422
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,905
one is suddenly confronted
with two entirely separate egos,

423
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:45,675
two entirely separate worlds
that can surface at any given moment.

424
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:49,048
A feeling of self-hatred,
usually triggered by a psychological shock

425
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,950
can split the personality in two.

426
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:54,320
Hence creating two or more personalities
with distinct memories

427
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:57,986
and distinct behavior patterns
within the same individual.

428
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:02,464
The patient then has
the false perception of the existence

429
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:06,798
of two distinct worlds, the real world
and the world inside a mirror.

430
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,303
These recordings were used
in Terrence's trial.

431
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:19,479
You'll see they speak for themselves.

432
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,721
<i>Why did you set
the department store on fire?</i>

433
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:28,952
<i>In order to destroy the mirrors.</i>

434
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:34,455
<i>Only fire can destroy mirrors,
isn't that right, Doctor?</i>

435
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:40,059
<i>What made you think you absolutely
had to destroy those mirrors, Terrence?</i>

436
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:48,644
<i>They killed my Helen
and my three children.</i>

437
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:50,811
<i>For what reason?</i>

438
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,279
<i>Why would mirrors
want to kill your family?</i>

439
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,045
<i>- Because I didn't...
- Didn't do what?</i>

440
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,216
<i>They asked me to find Esseker.</i>

441
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,313
Oh, my God.

442
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,187
<i>We all are looking for Esseker.</i>

443
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:03,954
Amy.

444
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,086
Excuse me, I have to go.

445
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:12,060
<i>Tell me about Esseker, Terrence.
Who is Esseker?</i>

446
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:14,797
<i>I don't know who Esseker is!</i>

447
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,501
<i>I don't know who Esseker is!</i>

448
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,440
<i>I don't know.</i>

449
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:31,880
Mrs. Carson? It's Rosa.

450
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:37,424
Mr. Ben is here.
He's moving all of the furniture around.

451
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:13,458
- Hey. How was school today?
- Good.

452
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,794
Good. I'll be right back.

453
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,434
Dad...

454
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:32,140
Sweetheart, just give me a second.
I gotta take care of a couple of things.

455
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:56,764
Daddy, what are you doing?

456
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,940
Honey, don't look scared.
Everything's fine.

457
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:04,912
I think it looks nicer like this. Don't you?

458
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,457
Rosa, what's happening?

459
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:26,964
Take the kids downstairs, right now.
Right now.

460
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,596
What the hell are you doing?

461
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,866
Amy, you're gonna have to trust me.
This is for your own protection.

462
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,306
Get out of the house, right now!

463
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:36,470
Hey, are you listening to me?
You are scaring the kids!

464
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:38,036
If you don't leave immediately,
I'm calling the police,

465
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:40,082
and I warn you,
you will never see your kids again!

466
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,516
Amy, I am not crazy.
These mirrors are dangerous.

467
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:45,577
At first I thought it was just the ones
in the store, but after Angela was killed,

468
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:46,952
I realized they can get at you anywhere.

469
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,959
I promise I will leave the house.
Just let me cover these damn mirrors.

470
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,961
What's wrong with you?

471
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:56,257
I know what you've been going through
hasn't been easy.

472
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:59,927
But guess what?
It hasn't been easy for us, either!

473
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:02,995
Angela was a part of our lives, too,
you know that?

474
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:05,905
It's not fair what you're doing to us, Ben!

475
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:09,741
Michael... He's acting so strange now.

476
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:13,840
He always wants to be alone. He won't
talk to me. He's having nightmares.

477
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:16,784
Ben, your behavior is rubbing off on him!

478
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:19,788
He is six years old. I have to protect him!

479
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:22,253
I want to show you something.

480
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,653
- Ben, let go of me!
- You don't want to believe me?

481
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,753
Fine, I'll show you.

482
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:30,322
- What are you doing?
- I'll show you!

483
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:33,425
Are you crazy?

484
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,899
- Have you gone completely mad?
- Just wait, you'll see.

485
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,839
- See what?
- You'll see.

486
00:59:40,477 --> 00:59:43,469
See what, Ben?
What am I supposed to see?

487
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:53,251
It's not happening.

488
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,087
It's not happening.

489
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:59,090
Amy, I swear to you, at the Mayflower...

490
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:04,030
I am not lying.

491
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:22,943
Ben. Let's go back inside, okay?

492
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:28,320
Put the gun away.

493
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:33,862
Listen to me, baby. I want to help you.

494
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:35,957
Tell the kids I'm sorry.

495
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,260
Ben!

496
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No!

497
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,785
Jesus Christ.

498
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

499
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,974
Larry, it's me. I need your help again.

500
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:58,612
I'm trying to locate the patient-employee
manifest for St. Matthew's Hospital.

501
01:05:58,688 --> 01:05:59,950
<i>Where is it?</i>

502
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:02,217
Where was it? They closed it down.

503
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,486
But it was in New York.
It's where the Mayflower used to be.

504
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,653
<i>The Mayflower? The department store?</i>

505
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:09,027
Do you have any idea where
they would store records for a hospital

506
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:11,293
that's been closed for over 50 years?

507
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:13,835
<i>No, I don't. But I can send someone
to city hall to check it out.</i>

508
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:17,839
<i>If it's a public hospital, there'd be a record
of it. Tell me exactly what you need.</i>

509
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:21,536
Same thing. I'm looking for a patient
or an employee with the name Esseker.

510
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:26,207
<i>All right, I'm on it. Give me a couple hours,
and, Ben, keep your head down.</i>

511
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:50,129
Hey.

512
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,674
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I think so.

513
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:56,502
It's Anna Esseker.

514
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,444
I didn't really know what you wanted,
so I got all the medical files.

515
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,576
This is perfect, Larry. This is perfect.

516
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:06,520
What happened?
Did you get in an accident?

517
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,784
Anna Esseker's file,
did you have to go to city hall for it?

518
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,257
No, I didn't have to go anywhere.

519
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:13,295
All the files in that place were in storage
with the cold-case evidence.

520
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,522
Why, because of the fire?

521
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:18,260
No, it's before the fire.
It's a totally different case.

522
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:20,596
Anna was a patient at St. Matthew's.

523
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:23,298
She was in the psych ward
run by a Dr. Kane.

524
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:26,500
Now get this,
she was only 12 years old when she died.

525
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:27,564
What?

526
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:31,602
When the nurses went on their rounds
first thing in the morning, October 6, 1952,

527
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:34,673
they discovered that all the patients
had left their rooms during the night,

528
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,741
and they'd all gathered in the main hall.

529
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,413
Ben, they were all dead, including the girl.

530
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:42,980
Apparently, they killed each other.
I mean, it was a slaughterhouse.

531
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,425
That's when they closed the place down.
Who knows what really happened?

532
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:47,860
- What about the doctor? Kane?
- Well, they arrested him.

533
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,795
They found him dead
first day of the hearing.

534
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:53,323
He slashed his wrists
with a piece of the cell mirror.

535
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:57,265
- Thanks for your help.
- Good luck.

536
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:04,740
Damn it!

537
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:42,914
Jesus.

538
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,796
"October 6, 1952."

539
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:08,801
"Anna Esseker is diagnosed with
severe schizophrenia,

540
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:13,178
"leading to withdrawal from reality,
delusional and violent behavior."

541
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:26,654
"Pennsylvania, August 1951."

542
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:46,848
They don't match.

543
01:09:49,085 --> 01:09:53,215
Anna Esseker was discharged
from St. Matthew's Hospital October 4.

544
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,450
Two days before the massacre.

545
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,943
She's alive, isn't she?

546
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:37,897
You almost done, sweetie? Okay.

547
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:42,404
Why is Daddy acting so scared?
It's not normal.

548
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,771
He's way older than me.

549
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:50,904
And I'm not acting scared, but he is.

550
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:56,811
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Michael? What are you doing?

551
01:10:57,887 --> 01:10:59,081
Nothing.

552
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:03,585
- Okay, well, we gotta get going, all right?
- Okay.

553
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:39,183
<i>- Amy? Amy, what's wrong?
- Ben.</i>

554
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:42,094
You have to come
to the house right now.

555
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:43,756
I'm so scared.

556
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:46,733
<i>- Amy, what's wrong?
- I'm so scared.</i>

557
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:50,033
<i>- Amy, just tell me what happened.
- There's something in the house.</i>

558
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:54,235
<i>- Something in the mirrors.
- I'm on my way.</i>

559
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:56,367
God damn it!

560
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,046
Come on.

561
01:12:54,770 --> 01:13:00,402
- Dad? When are you coming back home?
- Really soon, sweetheart. Come here.

562
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:06,408
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too, sweetheart.

563
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,040
I gotta go.

564
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,347
I'm afraid to stay here.

565
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:12,387
There's gonna be windows and mirrors
wherever you go.

566
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:14,888
Anything that causes a reflection
right now is dangerous.

567
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:16,982
At least inside the house
we've covered everything.

568
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,220
It's the safest place to be.

569
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,255
Amy, I'm so sorry.

570
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,855
No. It's not your fault.
I should've believed you.

571
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:27,933
Come here.

572
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:34,900
Ben, you do whatever it takes to end this.

573
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,512
- You hear me?
- I will.

574
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:42,313
I'll be right back.

575
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:39,524
Jesus.

576
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,094
Yes, sir?

577
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:46,664
Excuse me. Is this the Esseker farm?

578
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:49,438
- What is it, Jimmy?
- I don't know, Ma.

579
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:54,176
- What can I do for you, sir?
- I'm looking for Anna. Anna Esseker.

580
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:57,511
There's a man looking for...
You said Anna?

581
01:15:57,586 --> 01:15:59,213
Yes, Anna Esseker.

582
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:01,222
An Anna Esseker, Ma.

583
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:06,825
Look, I'm sorry to bother you.
I must have the wrong place.

584
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,661
What is it you want with Anna Esseker?

585
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,406
I'm doing a research paper
on schizophrenia.

586
01:16:20,476 --> 01:16:23,070
I became familiar with
Anna Esseker's case.

587
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:25,477
I just wanted to ask her some questions.

588
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:30,681
Go tell Grandpa there's a man here
who's asking about his sister.

589
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:31,946
Okay.

590
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,055
Thank you.

591
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:35,419
Grandpa?

592
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:39,254
You know, up to this day,

593
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:42,729
visions of Anna's fits
still haunt me at night.

594
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:49,102
I helped my father fix up this part
of the basement especially for her.

595
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,208
Her fits were too violent.

596
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:56,176
<i>My mother couldn't
take her screams anymore.</i>

597
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:09,847
We had every priest, doctor, healer,
coming in from all over the county,

598
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,893
but no one could help her.

599
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:32,278
So finally, a Dr. Kane from New York
answered my parents' cries for help.

600
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:38,419
He rejected the idea of demonic
possession, said he didn't believe in it.

601
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:43,117
He was convinced Anna suffered from
a rare form of personality disorder

602
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:46,659
and mirrors could help her.

603
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:51,055
He wanted Anna under his care,
at St. Matthew's.

604
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,227
My parents were very poor,

605
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:57,704
but he agreed to cover all the costs
of the hospital.

606
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,333
Where did she go after the hospital?

607
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:01,808
Don't you know?

608
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:04,505
She died there
with all of Kane's other patients.

609
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:07,014
Mr. Esseker, I read the file.

610
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,812
Anna left the hospital
two days before the massacre.

611
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:13,377
Dr. Kane altered the documents
so she could disappear.

612
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,048
Where did you get that document?

613
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:20,583
I need you to tell me where she went
after St. Matthew's.

614
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:23,662
She came back
and stayed with us for a while.

615
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:27,998
What do you mean for a while?
What happened? Why did she leave?

616
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:30,834
- I don't want to talk about that.
- Why did she leave?

617
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:35,071
Because strange things
started to happen in the house.

618
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:36,167
With Anna?

619
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:39,702
No, no, not with Anna anymore.
No, she was totally cured.

620
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:45,277
Strange things started to happen
with the mirrors, didn't they?

621
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:48,653
Mr. Esseker, I need to know where Anna
is now. It's a matter of life and death.

622
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,056
Do not make me threaten you.

623
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:56,120
We sent her somewhere
where mirrors are forbidden.

624
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:01,067
- Where the mirrors couldn't find her.
- Where? Where?

625
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:05,604
St. Augustine's Monastery,
on the road to Reedfield.

626
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:09,898
How can I help you?

627
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:12,863
I'm sorry to disturb you, Sister,

628
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:17,207
but I've come to speak with a member
of your community. Anna Esseker.

629
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:19,671
Is she expecting you?

630
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:21,245
No, not really.

631
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:24,183
If you're not listed, I cannot help you, sir.

632
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:28,348
Can you at least tell her
that I've come from New York

633
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:30,448
to speak with her?

634
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:33,790
I work with Dr. Kane
from St. Matthew's Hospital.

635
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,858
It's very important, please.

636
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:47,003
St. Matthew's closed down in 1952.
Who are you?

637
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:49,236
My name is Benjamin Carson.

638
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:53,478
I work as a night watchman
on Sixth Avenue in New York City

639
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:56,847
in the building that used to be
St. Matthew's Hospital.

640
01:20:56,918 --> 01:20:59,478
What is it you want, Mr. Carson?

641
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:01,753
My family is in danger,

642
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:04,451
and what's threatening them
is asking for you.

643
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:08,724
I came all this way to ask you

644
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:11,027
why the mirrors that were left over
from St. Matthew's Hospital

645
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:13,363
are so desperate to find you.

646
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:16,398
Please, Miss Esseker.

647
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:18,801
If you don't help me,

648
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,206
I'm gonna lose the most important thing
to me in this world,

649
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:22,971
and that's my family.

650
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:28,549
Sit down, Mr. Carson.

651
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:40,595
The mirrors are merely windows
on our world.

652
01:21:41,863 --> 01:21:44,730
It is not the wish of the mirrors to find me

653
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:48,736
but of what is imprisoned inside them.

654
01:21:48,804 --> 01:21:50,897
What is imprisoned inside them?

655
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:55,801
At the time that I was at St. Matthew's,

656
01:21:56,812 --> 01:22:00,407
<i>Dr. Kane's therapy
for personality disorders</i>

657
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:05,351
<i>consisted of locking the patient up
in a mirrored room</i>

658
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:11,586
<i>for several days on end,
forcing them to confront their own image.</i>

659
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:17,060
<i>Dr. Kane was wrong about his theory.</i>

660
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:21,263
<i>There is no cure for schizophrenia,
Mr. Carson.</i>

661
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:26,806
It was something else.

662
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:33,539
<i>And whatever it was,
it left me and entered the mirrors.</i>

663
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:36,816
Since that day,

664
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:40,480
it has been collecting
the souls of the people it kills.

665
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:43,684
I'm sorry,

666
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:47,091
but if I agree to go with you
and return back to that place,

667
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:48,891
I will make it possible for the demon

668
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,831
to cross the threshold
back into the real world.

669
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:54,458
Do you understand
what that means for my family?

670
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:57,664
You can't do this.
You need to come back with me.

671
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:01,475
I'm going to pray for you and your family.

672
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:05,104
That's all I can do right now, Mr. Carson.
I'm sorry.

673
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:08,376
God bless you.

674
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:14,817
Gary Lewis, Terrence Berry and many
other men have died trying to find you.

675
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:17,085
And because they failed,
their families died, too.

676
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,786
Two days ago my sister was murdered.

677
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:23,454
My family will be next
if you don't help me.

678
01:23:23,899 --> 01:23:25,264
Please.

679
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:28,564
Please. Wait, wait.

680
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:33,606
This is my family.

681
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,575
This is my wife Amy

682
01:23:35,644 --> 01:23:38,408
and my daughter Daisy
and my son Michael.

683
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:40,909
They're beautiful.

684
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:44,409
They're innocent.
They've never hurt anybody.

685
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:47,954
Please.

686
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:49,780
Take the photo.

687
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:53,022
Just take the photo.

688
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:03,560
Look at them.

689
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:08,041
I'm sorry.

690
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,013
Who the hell do you think you are?

691
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:15,078
They're just kids!

692
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:54,587
<i>- Hello?
- Amy.</i>

693
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:57,250
<i>- Ben, where are you?
- At the monastery.</i>

694
01:24:57,726 --> 01:24:59,557
<i>- Did you find her?
- Yes.</i>

695
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:01,652
Yeah? Did you talk to...

696
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:04,424
<i>- Amy?
- Michael?</i>

697
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,500
Michael?

698
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:09,897
<i>Ben, hold on, Michael's gone.</i>

699
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:11,233
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

700
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,706
I fell asleep with the kids on the bed
and now I don't know where he is.

701
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:14,833
<i>Michael?</i>

702
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:16,308
Amy, what's going on?
Is everything all right?

703
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:18,837
Oh, fuck.

704
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:21,139
Amy, what's going on?
Have you got Michael?

705
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:23,812
Oh, my God.

706
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:27,314
Ben, there's water everywhere.

707
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:29,345
Oh, my God.

708
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:33,154
<i>You've got to be careful of the water.
It creates reflections.</i>

709
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,192
Someone is in the house.

710
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:37,959
Someone scraped all the mirrors!

711
01:25:38,033 --> 01:25:39,625
Amy, where is Michael?

712
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:42,363
I don't know. I don't know where he is.
I don't see him anywhere.

713
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:44,268
<i>Amy, listen to me,
you've gotta stay away from the water.</i>

714
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:47,069
<i>Get the kids
and stay away from the water!</i>

715
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:49,635
<i>- Michael?
- Amy?</i>

716
01:25:49,711 --> 01:25:52,009
Amy? Shit!

717
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:03,589
Which room is she in? Which one?

718
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,525
My family is not dying tonight.
You are coming with me.

719
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:26,574
Michael?

720
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:46,528
Daisy?

721
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:51,265
Daisy, come here.

722
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:06,844
Come here, Daisy.

723
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:09,247
Mom?

724
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:17,230
Come here, sweetheart.

725
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:38,818
What are you doing in there?

726
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:43,087
Everything's going to be all right.

727
01:27:57,305 --> 01:27:58,863
No!

728
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:04,677
No! No!

729
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:05,906
Daisy!

730
01:28:08,983 --> 01:28:11,042
Come here! Get down!
Get down, right now!

731
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:14,054
Get down, sweetie. Get down.
Oh, my God, are you okay?

732
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:17,614
Oh, my God! Stay right there.
Don't move, baby! Don't move!

733
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:20,126
- Mom, why did you do that to me?
- It wasn't me, sweetheart.

734
01:28:20,195 --> 01:28:22,129
You know I would never hurt you.
You know that.

735
01:28:22,197 --> 01:28:24,529
Here. Hold this. Hold it tight.

736
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:26,991
Okay?

737
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:33,238
Here, get down, sweetie.
Let me see. Let me see.

738
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,373
Let me see, sweetie. It's gonna be okay.

739
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:40,505
All right? I know it hurts. Stay right there.

740
01:28:42,584 --> 01:28:46,020
All right. Give me your hand.
I need you to hold it really tight, okay?

741
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:48,612
Just flat and tight, just like that. Okay.

742
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:51,989
Now, I need you to listen to me,
okay, baby?

743
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,960
- You have to be very brave.
- Okay.

744
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:55,825
I need you to stay here
no matter what happens.

745
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:59,458
No matter what you hear. Do not move
from this closet until I come back.

746
01:28:59,534 --> 01:29:01,001
- You understand me, right?
- Yes.

747
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:03,867
Okay. Okay.

748
01:29:03,938 --> 01:29:06,065
Do not move. I love you.

749
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:08,634
Don't move.

750
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:37,735
Michael?

751
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:56,787
Michael?

752
01:29:59,961 --> 01:30:01,292
Where are you?

753
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:04,993
Michael?

754
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:24,179
Michael!

755
01:30:24,819 --> 01:30:26,980
Michael, what are you doing?

756
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:35,323
Don't be scared, Mommy.
He just wants to play with us.

757
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:39,063
Michael, I want you to drop that knife,
right now.

758
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:40,657
Do you hear me?

759
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:45,968
You know very well you're not allowed
to play with knives. Don't you?

760
01:30:48,076 --> 01:30:49,270
Come on.

761
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,609
That's a good boy.

762
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:57,075
Give me the knife, Michael.

763
01:30:57,685 --> 01:30:59,653
Michael! Michael!

764
01:31:02,724 --> 01:31:04,123
Michael?

765
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:13,428
Michael!

766
01:31:14,602 --> 01:31:15,933
Michael!

767
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,073
Michael?

768
01:31:22,677 --> 01:31:24,201
Michael.

769
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:26,911
Michael?

770
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:30,411
Why are you hiding from me, sweetheart?

771
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:43,553
Michael?

772
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

773
01:32:35,983 --> 01:32:38,918
You okay? Come on.

774
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:28,401
It's waiting for me downstairs.

775
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:41,978
Bring me inside. From now on,
I have to keep my eyes closed.

776
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:45,581
Step up. You're in the room.

777
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,815
Strap me in.

778
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:59,527
I spent the darkest days of my life
in this room.

779
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:04,093
Are you sure there's no other way?

780
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:06,765
This is for your family, Mr. Carson.

781
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:09,803
For your family.

782
01:34:23,925 --> 01:34:25,290
Michael?

783
01:35:09,503 --> 01:35:11,767
Michael? Michael, look at me.

784
01:35:14,308 --> 01:35:17,072
Michael! No, Michael!

785
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:21,537
No! Give him back to me! Give him back!

786
01:35:23,317 --> 01:35:24,841
No!

787
01:35:26,354 --> 01:35:28,584
No! Get out!

788
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:30,624
Come on, Michael!

789
01:35:30,691 --> 01:35:32,056
No!

790
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:33,787
Please. Please.

791
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:37,595
You must go now.

792
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:39,098
Thank you.

793
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:41,331
No!

794
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:46,870
Why?

795
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:24,569
Give him back, please!

796
01:36:24,645 --> 01:36:27,580
Give him back! Give him back!

797
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:29,676
Michael!

798
01:36:31,585 --> 01:36:35,021
No! No!

799
01:36:59,447 --> 01:37:00,436
Michael?

800
01:37:00,514 --> 01:37:02,345
Oh, my baby!

801
01:37:27,975 --> 01:37:29,340
Come on.

802
01:37:31,779 --> 01:37:34,009
One, two, three...

803
01:37:41,489 --> 01:37:43,116
...five, six...

804
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:47,693
Thank God!

805
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:56,101
Thank you. I love you!

806
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:09,274
Anna?

807
01:38:37,778 --> 01:38:39,109
Anna?

808
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

809
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

810
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

811
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:23,081
Come out, you bitch!

812
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:36,476
Oh, my God.

813
01:42:38,452 --> 01:42:40,181
Oh, my baby.

814
01:42:44,658 --> 01:42:46,285
I love you both.

815
01:42:54,435 --> 01:42:56,062
I love you, guys.
