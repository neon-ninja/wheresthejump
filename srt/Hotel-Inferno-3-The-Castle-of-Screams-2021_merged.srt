00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,249
I've always known you were no saint...

3
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,294
drowning in your own anger...
blinded by your own ghosts.

4
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:47,674
But I still chose you
as father of my children.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I had no idea what you were capable of.
Honey? Is... is that you?

6
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,256
Do you remember the day we met?

7
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,093
It was so damn hot, the street
looked like a river of oil.

8
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,471
But in that moment, next to you,

9
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:37,890
I just felt like a normal person...

10
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:39,726
You know

11
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,644
it was a good feeling...

12
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:44,063
I remember that day
like it was yesterday...

13
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:50,403
and I curse that moment every
single day of my fucking life

14
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:55,908
I lied because I didn't want to
involve you in my shitty life...

15
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:57,952
and I was scared...

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
scared that my job...
killing people...
you would never accept me.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I can UNDERSTAND why you
lied to me all this time...
But I can't ever FORGIVE you.

18
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:44,707
If I knew who you really were

19
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,461
I wouldn't have brought
our son into the world.

20
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,546
He deserved better than this.

21
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,924
You abandoned him,

22
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:54,967
I didn't abandon you.

23
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,427
They killed me.

24
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,180
They fucking killed me.

25
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,518
THEY

26
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,228
FUCKING

27
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:07,730
KILLED ME!!!!

28
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:43,725
Frank?

29
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,183
Witch?!!!

30
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:47,854
A... are you still alive?!!!

31
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,564
Of course I am

32
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,860
although I am still imprisoned
within this rotting carcass.

33
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:58,364
I don't know what any of
that cryptic shit means

34
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:02,326
but I'm fucking glad you're still here

35
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:06,205
It means that we must find
the second element of your soul

36
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,332
the Ice

37
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,002
the second step towards your resurrection.

38
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,003
But now

39
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,257
we must also find a new shell for me.

40
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,259
What happened to your voice?

41
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:20,636
Nothing. This is my voice.

42
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,264
It has always been this way.

43
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,183
Take me with you

44
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,685
strap me to your back

45
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:30,855
'tis the best way for us to bond.

46
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,608
How the fuck can you still talk?

47
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:37,737
Damaging the shell
doesn't harm me sweetheart

48
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,281
it only pisses me off.

49
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:45,119
You know, I was growing attached
to that dusty old carcass

50
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:48,331
Whatever Witch. What do we do now?

51
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:49,706
Witch?

52
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:52,335
Why do you still call me Witch?

53
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,760
We need to get to the Castle of Screams where we'll
find the Ice element, and the Keeper who protects it.

54
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:03,012
But before we kill the Keeper

55
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,473
you need to gear up and heal that hand...

56
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:08,100
there is still lots to do, sweetheart.

57
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:14,232
That sarcophagus. Its a secret
passage that leads to the river.

58
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:19,070
We'll reach the Castle of Screams and the
frozen borough before you can say "borough"

59
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,405
Fucking "borough". Are we there yet?

60
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:26,327
I don't like sarcasm
sweetheart, no-one in Hell does.

61
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,804
Let's leave this cursed
river before it's too late.

62
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:34,395
So, borough, castle, cathedral. Is
everything in Hell fucking medieval?

63
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:41,527
Of course not. This artificial place the
Pentaculum, or whatever they call it now...

64
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,654
Hotel Inferno

65
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,199
the most fucking ridiculous
name they have ever used!

66
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:53,456
Still, I'd expect nothing less
from that jerk Jorge Mistrandia.

67
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:58,878
As I was saying, this Hotel
Inferno is not pure Hell

68
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:05,176
it's more like an artificial tunnel
for entering and exiting parts of Hell.

69
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,803
Hell is life's pain and suffering.

70
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:16,346
Any shade of pain, any kind of suffering, past,
present or future, that is what the Inferno is made of.

71
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:22,652
The Mistrandia family and their cult
created Hotel Inferno during the Middle Ages.

72
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:31,361
All of the pain and suffering they caused in the process
manifests here, like an indestructible living painting.

73
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,455
But it is also very personal.

74
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:38,501
The Inferno adapts to the soul
of the person who stares into it.

75
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,378
Where are we?

76
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:48,594
The frozen square. But the structures and surroundings are
changing. Take that building, for example: it wasn't here before.

77
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,143
I... I've been here
before, when I was alive...

78
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:04,894
when I was young, I know it... but I can't
remember. I feel like... I need to go inside

79
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,157
You'll remember, don't worry.

80
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,619
You will remember.

81
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:56,203
Farmers they aren't particularly
clever or dangerous on their own.

82
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,790
Unfortunately, they tend to congregate

83
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,465
so... be careful.

84
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:25,691
Holy mother of fuck!!!

85
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:33,449
Frank, Ice Keeper. Ice Keeper,
Frank. He's so pretty, isn't he?

86
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,536
Yeah, pretty as a dirty hairy asshole.

87
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,707
Can we get the fuck out of here now?
I don't wanna be swatted like a fly.

88
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,461
Don't worry! He can't hear you.

89
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,421
They're sedating him

90
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,384
We need get out of here

91
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:55,387
you're still too weak to fight them.

92
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,407
Fuck!!! Stay away from me!!!

93
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,910
Holy shit, holy shit!!!!

94
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,712
Fuck that building, I'm not going
back into that shithole. FUCK

95
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:44,019
Well, at least we found
this. Let's try this scope.

96
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:50,568
WHAT THE FUCK!!!!! AAAaaahhhh!

97
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,832
It hurts!

98
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,837
Of course it hurts,
otherwise it won't work.

99
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:21,724
Ooohh... that is a nasty wound sweetheart.

100
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,143
I'm not gonna die

101
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:28,230
don't worry...

102
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:34,653
We have to take care of your shell.

103
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,010
So, do you remember that building now?

104
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,558
I think it's related to my mother...
she was here... but I can't remember why

105
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:11,482
Well, the Ice element's corresponding
emotions are sadness and loneliness.

106
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:17,112
If you are seeing memories of your mother I
guess she was really a shitty parent ahahah

107
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:21,075
Mind your own fucking business Witch

108
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:22,993
Go and find the mine.

109
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:27,790
The door is hidden somewhere
on that boundary wall.

110
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,561
Other memories...

111
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,858
Other fucking memories...
they hurt... they hurt so much.

112
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:59,446
What are we doing here?

113
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,491
We need to find an infernal firearm.

114
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:11,075
The miners always keep a gun or two in their loot, even if they
don't know how to use them. They are fascinated by that kind of thing.

115
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:17,798
The miners are slow, but they're
also strong and very aggressive.

116
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,592
You don't fucking say!!

117
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:26,765
They only die if you decapitate them
or bash their brains into a bloody pulp.

118
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,130
I told you to destroy their heads.

119
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:25,884
Do you wanna take my place,
you fucking piece of shit?

120
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,122
Now it's gone

121
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:05,674
Stop sweetheart, take that piece of meat.
I can help you to make a "head lantern".

122
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,594
What I'm supposed to do?

123
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,929
Let me guide your hands.

124
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:12,347
How?

125
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:19,730
I'm strapped to your back, it
won't be difficult, just relax.

126
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,157
We are done.

127
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:38,991
This little friend shines every time you enter in a dark room, you won't
need any torch. Just pay attention to not hurt him, or he'll explode.

128
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:53,138
Here you go, the Flesh Hand Gun

129
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,724
Are you sure this is going to work?

130
00:16:56,308 --> 00:17:00,479
That fucking Gatling gun is
broken, it jams all the time.

131
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:06,151
No, my sweetheart. You just
don't know how to use it.

132
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,738
Everything requires a pain
sacrifice here in Hell.

133
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,035
Pain makes infernal weapons work.

134
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:21,041
If you kill a demon, or if
you're hurt, you get bullets.

135
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:22,834
How many bullets

136
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,460
Just one

137
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:32,795
What!!! So I need to kill a demon or anything else with my
bare hands, just to get one lousy bullet for this motherfucker?

138
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:37,140
Yes, or you can hurt
yourself if you prefer.

139
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
This Flesh Handgun can
hold only one bullet.
Only one bullet?!! What a fucking joke.

140
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:53,699
And how am I supposed to know if the weapon
is ready to shoot? I don't see a magazine.

141
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,625
Infernal Firearms have eyes

142
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,260
one for each shot.

143
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:28,442
If the eyes are open, it means the gun is
ready to shoot. What else would it mean?

144
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,842
Let's use this portal. These pyramidal
structures will teleport us to the Alchemist.

145
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:05,729
That kind soul will help to heal your
wounds... and that isn't all he'll do

146
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,331
This is worrying

147
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,207
What?

148
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:26,582
The Alchemist isn't here.

149
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:34,091
He's infested the area with those minor demons to
protect his possessions. Stay alert, sweetheart.

150
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

151
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:36,611
Fuck these shits, and fuck that Alchemist.

152
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:48,790
Back in the cathedral, was
that thing really my wife?

153
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:51,001
It was just a surrogate.

154
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:59,217
You retrieved the Fire element, the first layer
of your soul, which is made of love and happiness.

155
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:05,599
I guess your wife was the thing
you loved most in your life.

156
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,517
Why did I have to kill her?

157
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:15,358
You need to destroy the emotion that corresponds with
the element: in this case, your happiness and love.

158
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:24,659
The Alchemist is a lonely demon, and
he is very protective over his stuff.

159
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,998
He hates the idea of strangers
touching his instruments and potions.

160
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:36,421
Without the Alchemist, we
have to do it ourselves.

161
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:43,804
Put me on the table... well...
place my shell on the table.

162
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,611
What am I supposed to do?

163
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,947
Now cut off my right hand

164
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:03,656
Are you sure?

165
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:05,700
Do you want a new hand or not?

166
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,202
I suppose so

167
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:10,163
Then chop off my right hand!

168
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:14,167
Hey Witch, is this your right hand?

169
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,795
Don't you know left from right?

170
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:25,128
I was kidding, you moron. I was trying to distract you... You
know, before I fucking hurt you? To ease the... No? Whatever

171
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:37,023
Aaaaaahhh, sweet agony...

172
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,375
now attach it to your stump

173
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:56,834
How?!!

174
00:22:57,502 --> 00:23:03,758
Just stick it into your wound,
my hand will do the rest.

175
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,063
Take that green potion

176
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,065
on the gauze...

177
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:22,360
Where the fuck is it? Aahh... shit...

178
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,696
I can't see a shit...

179
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,249
Pour the potion on the gauze...

180
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:42,547
and there we go.

181
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,220
Just don't use that hand straight away

182
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,599
it isn't ready yet.

183
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,392
When will it be ready?

184
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,729
You'll know, don't worry.

185
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:03,234
The Alchemist won't be happy that
we've messed around with his stuff.

186
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,489
Speak of the devil.

187
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,961
Calm down motherfucker,
we used your stuff, yes...

188
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,423
Hey!!!! I'm sorry... but we
needed it... do you understand?

189
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,636
Oh fuck off, I'm not good with words.

190
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:41,523
Let's teach this motherfucker
some old Frank manners.

191
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,911
Subdue him, but don't kill him!

192
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,836
We need him.

193
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:58,391
Are you calm now? Are we cool?

194
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:05,440
He respects you. He said that because you
have given him pain, he will gladly help you.

195
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:14,066
What the fuck is this sadomasochistic bullshit?
So, we are mates because I kicked your ass?

196
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:21,456
Yeah, there is nothing like an
ass kicking to clear your mind.

197
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:30,381
He said you are funny, and he doesn't
like funny people. Neither of us do.

198
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:49,526
How do we get back to the frozen square?

199
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:53,571
That door leads to many places.

200
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:03,039
The Alchemist can change
the destination at will.

201
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,417
What now?

202
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:10,839
We found a proper
weapon, but now it's gone.

203
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,760
You can't wake the Keeper up and
murder him with your bare hands.

204
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:22,183
There's a secret passage in the Castle of
Screams. It leads to the frozen borough.

205
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,604
That is the only place left where
we can find another hellish weapon.

206
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:33,862
Welcome to the Castle of Screams.

207
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:37,907
Can you see those SCREAMER up there?

208
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,286
They're sedating the Ice Keeper

209
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:47,083
We have to stop their
sublime melody to wake him up.

210
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,254
Wake him up? What a fucking brilliant idea.

211
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:03,016
This way, through that hole in the wall.

212
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,589
Ooooh, incredible, can
you feel it, sweetheart?

213
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:40,178
This borough is swarming
with farmers and their beasts.

214
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:47,268
Hey Witch, look up at the sky, a
big "fuck you" is flying towards you.

215
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,480
Nobody likes your sarcasm here!!!

216
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,110
We need to loot every house
and find a better weapon.

217
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,077
Go into that room.

218
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:12,710
Check in that pile. Quickly!

219
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:27,141
It looks like they are macerating a flesh
shotgun between all of those corpses.

220
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:32,272
Great, another shitty weapon that
needs one kill to get one bullet.

221
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:39,445
Yes Frank, but this shotgun can be
upgraded. We'll fix that, don't worry.

222
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,660
It has to be there, I can feel it.

223
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:58,047
We're lucky, this weapon
is strong, very strong.

224
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,225
Dang... dang...

225
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,579
Can you smell that, sweetheart?

226
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:39,122
It's the stench of the Purulent Chickens,
nasty hideous and dangerous beasts.

227
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,257
Take care

228
00:30:55,772 --> 00:31:02,528
Relax, this is only the henhouse. This is
where they keep their food alive for later.

229
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,907
There aren't any chickens here.

230
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

231
00:31:55,623 --> 00:32:00,795
I thought you just said 'there aren't any
chickens here'? Then what the fuck is THAT??!!

232
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,964
That bastard wasn't meant to be here.

233
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:05,716
Hurry up, take his aborted egg.

234
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:09,720
Not the eggs on his chest:
they are just decoration

235
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:28,114
Not the eggs on his chest: they are
just decoration to attract females.

236
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:30,616
The real egg is in his anus.

237
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,994
Oh, come on!!!

238
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:43,087
Look in those cages. You
should find some Rotten Gloves.

239
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:14,595
AAAaaaaahh... what the fuck did he do to me

240
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,640
He impregnated you

241
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:21,269
What?!!! So that was his... fuuuuuck!!!

242
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,230
I fucking ripped his dick off??!!

243
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:20,036
Take cover Frank, he's going kamikaze!

244
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:21,494
What?

245
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:23,539
Ruuuun!!!!

246
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:30,940
Wearing them will help
your body to heal faster.

247
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:44,327
Crack the egg

248
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:53,204
Hey, are you gonna give me a degree in "fucking infernal
nonsense" after all these shitty lessons about Hell?

249
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:57,341
I warned you not to make jokes...

250
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,097
pull out the core and squeeze it.

251
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,947
That will help to mask your odor.

252
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:23,868
They won't recognize
you as human for a while.

253
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:34,670
Just remember: no loud
noises and don't touch them.

254
00:37:58,194 --> 00:37:59,194
Great

255
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:02,031
two extra eyes for the flesh shotgun.

256
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:21,217
Now the shotgun can hold three bullets.

257
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:26,096
Whoops, does that count
as a loud noise? Fuck!!!!!

258
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,736
I told you we could upgrade this weapon.

259
00:38:52,915 --> 00:39:00,548
If you attach the scope to the flesh shotgun, it will
temporary turn the shotgun into a Flesh Sniper Rifle.

260
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:04,885
Amazing!

261
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:12,768
Remember that every sniper shot takes
three eyes, or bullets as you call them.

262
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:17,231
You will get one eye for killing
a demon or harming yourself.

263
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:24,029
I realize you are so fucking old that you probably
have Alzheimer's tap-dancing around in your head

264
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:30,995
but my short-term memory works just fine,
so you don't need to fucking repeat yourself.

265
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:34,582
I warned you not to make jokes...

266
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:46,719
Kill all those Screamer, we
need to wake up the Keeper.

267
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,786
I think that was the last one

268
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:59,124
he's awake

269
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:04,004
We still have time to make another
upgrade to the flesh shotgun

270
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:06,173
the harpoon

271
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,842
That will help you to defeat the Ice Keeper

272
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:12,262
Do we really need to
fight this son of a bitch?

273
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,599
Do you want to resurrect
and save your wife, or not?

274
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,978
Okay... Where do we find this harpoon?

275
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,313
The Alchemist

276
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:38,205
Aaaaahhhh... what the
fuck is happening to me!!!

277
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:47,172
We forgot: you were impregnated
by that purulent chicken.

278
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:54,388
Look at your beautiful son! Ahahahaahah

279
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,944
What's so fucking funny?!

280
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:15,075
You, sweetheart. It's
hilarious when you suffer

281
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:19,329
Fuck you Witch, just fuck you...

282
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:33,093
How many eggs did this
motherfucker squirt into my stomach?

283
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:39,933
Hey, are you there?

284
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:48,067
Hey, my perverted friend. We're back

285
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:52,362
we forgot to take the...

286
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:54,073
the harpoon

287
00:42:54,865 --> 00:42:55,865
the harpoon

288
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:58,827
So, you've learned something after all!

289
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:01,622
You're not as dumb as you look.

290
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:04,875
Fuck you

291
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:14,885
He said he will give us the harpoon, but only
if we help him with the "thing" in that room.

292
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:17,054
Thing? What thing?

293
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:22,101
I don't know sweetheart,
but it sounds scary.

294
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:25,646
Aren't you curious to find out?

295
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the fuck is wrong with you, Witch?
Why do you keep calling me "Witch",
sweetheart? That isn't my name

296
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,786
What the fuck was that!

297
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:52,047
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

298
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:56,677
Don't worry, your odor is still
masked by the smell of the egg.

299
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:25,038
The Alchemist said that he needs a
piece of its body, any piece will do.

300
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:30,669
Is a piece of shit fine, motherfucker?
Fuck you and this thing!!!

301
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:58,655
Look out! He's drinking his own blood!
Don't let him turn into a Blood Drunken.

302
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:03,493
Here we go with that cryptic shit
again. What is that supposed to mean?

303
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:10,584
When a demon drinks its own blood or the blood
of another demon, it turns into a Blood Drunken.

304
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:15,797
They are particularly dangerous
because they're so unpredictable.

305
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:41,448
What the fuck just happened to the weapon?

306
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:49,539
If you kill a Blood Drunken with
a weapon, it will become enchanted

307
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:53,502
more lethal, but also fragile.

308
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,757
Heart...

309
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:03,720
we can use it later.

310
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:07,140
Take his head too.

311
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:23,323
Shit, now we're talking. This
hand is... fucking awesome.

312
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:28,203
Glad you like it, sweetheart.
Eventually, we'll merge perfectly.

313
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:33,208
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

314
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:36,670
I can help you to make a "Void Bag".

315
00:46:37,129 --> 00:46:40,799
Let me guide your hands.

316
00:46:54,229 --> 00:47:00,902
Now you can carry any object you
find, an unlimited number of objects.

317
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:08,035
But this gift isn't without cost: the more
objects you carry, the more pain you'll feel.

318
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,829
Of course it has to hurt...

319
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:13,623
of fucking course...

320
00:47:35,187 --> 00:47:42,110
Fuck you, you sadomasochistic fuck, all
this mess just for a lousy harpoon?!!

321
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:45,364
You should give me all your shit
after what I've been through.

322
00:47:48,492 --> 00:47:56,492
He said that you're right, you did an excellent job,
so he is giving us a gift: a bottle of Christ's Urine

323
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:01,671
Christ's what? Are you serious?

324
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:05,300
Oh no, it's not really Jesus's piss

325
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:11,765
it is just an acid, an
incredibly strong acid.

326
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,727
We call it Christ's Urine here, because..

327
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:20,232
Well we don't really have
time for that story, do we?

328
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:50,302
Wait

329
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:54,516
he said that you need to complete
a ritual before you can use it.

330
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:58,979
You must drink demon
blood, from a bone chalice

331
00:48:59,563 --> 00:49:07,563
Wow, what a coincidence! I am so thirsty, and I was thinking to myself,
"when are we going to find a refreshing chalice of demon's blood?".

332
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:19,199
Can you believe that? Thanks so much, you are a life
saver... let's see... bone fucking chalice... and yeah.

333
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,000
We still have that demon's heart somewhere. Here
you go, some drops of blood... some drops of...

334
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,555
what the fuck is wrong with this heart.

335
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:36,224
Come on!!!

336
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:38,434
FUCK!!!!

337
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:49,821
And of course not even a
drop inside the chalice.

338
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:58,580
Lucky I'm not a fussy drinker, eh?

339
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,461
Do you have an olive? No? Fuck it...

340
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,386
Cheers, motherfuckers!

341
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,898
Now leave me here, on the ground

342
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:26,607
Why?

343
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:29,486
You need to get inside that building, Frank

344
00:50:30,362 --> 00:50:32,113
No fucking way

345
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:34,533
The Keeper will recognise my smell.

346
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:38,119
If I stay strapped to your
back, he'll find us immediately.

347
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,207
Those walls will protect you
from the Ice Keeper, trust me.

348
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:50,882
You have to stay silent and invisible, so hide in
there or you won't last a minute. Leave me here.

349
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:55,387
Don't worry, the Alchemist
will take care of me

350
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:42,142
Okay, here you go.

351
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:05,266
Fucking Christ!!!

352
00:53:08,395 --> 00:53:10,313
I'm just getting started with you

353
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

354
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:54,190
Fucking ice, fucking
sliding motherfucking ice.

355
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:58,361
Solid walls my ass!!!

356
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,596
He's still alive!!!

357
00:55:09,641 --> 00:55:11,893
Just fucking die.

358
00:55:12,644 --> 00:55:14,938
Drink this, motherfucker.

359
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:23,863
And now, super fucking knife!!!

360
00:55:51,808 --> 00:55:57,981
Why don't you just die, you
little cunt. Oh, fuck off you demon

361
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:33,182
ohh you fucking bastard

362
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:02,045
Motherfucker!!!

363
00:57:34,494 --> 00:57:40,249
You made it! The Keeper is gone.
You are perfect, my sweetheart.

364
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:42,752
I saw it the moment you
stepped into that hotel.

365
00:57:43,086 --> 00:57:45,004
What are you talking about?

366
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:49,133
Let me guide your hands.

367
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:39,434
But you haven't got the Ice element yet.

368
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:45,356
Go into that room.

369
00:59:05,835 --> 00:59:07,503
What is this place?

370
00:59:10,423 --> 00:59:13,217
You'll find a familiar soul in there.

371
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:25,021
I've told you already: after killing the Keeper, you need
to destroy the corresponding emotion to get the element.

372
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:37,533
The Ice element's corresponding emotions are
sadness and loneliness, and your mother...

373
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:39,577
What is going on??!!!

374
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:44,373
Well, she is the source
of all your sadness...

375
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:51,505
so...

376
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:54,008
You have to take her face, sweetheart.

377
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,095
How the fuck is this going to help?

378
00:59:57,386 --> 00:59:59,222
Rip her fucking face off!!!

379
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:00,181
No!!!

380
01:00:00,473 --> 01:00:01,473
I won't!!!

381
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:06,687
Do you want to see your wife again,
or would you prefer to rot in here?

382
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,779
Do it now!!!

383
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,207
Now take her place

384
01:00:48,229 --> 01:00:52,608
What you are doing?!! Stay
the fuck back, motherfucker

385
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,788
One final touch, and
we'll merge completely.

386
01:01:38,946 --> 01:01:42,617
You are my new shell, Frank.

387
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:45,036
What the fuck have you done?

388
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:48,289
Isn't that what you've always wanted?

389
01:01:48,664 --> 01:01:53,002
To be resurrected, to kill
Mistrandia and save your wife?

390
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:55,922
What the fuck are you
talking about, Witch?!

391
01:01:56,464 --> 01:02:02,345
You can't save your wife alone, sweetheart.
You need my strength, and I need a new shell.

392
01:02:02,637 --> 01:02:04,555
We're helping each other, you and I.

393
01:02:04,931 --> 01:02:07,433
Shut the fuck up, Witch

394
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:13,564
Why do you keep calling me Witch? That's the name
of my previous shell, and that shell is gone now.

395
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:15,857
Who are you?

396
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:19,153
You know who I am Frank, we
already met in that hotel.

397
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:21,322
I need to see my face...

398
01:02:21,614 --> 01:02:25,993
You know what Mistrandia used
to call me? The Plague Spreader

399
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:28,412
W... what have you done to me?!!

400
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:35,127
Now, we are one

401
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:43,039
