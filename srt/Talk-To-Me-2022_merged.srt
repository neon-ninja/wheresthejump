1
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:12,700
Duckett! Answer your phone.

2
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:14,408
My messages are delivering,

3
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,242
so I know you're
fuckin' seeing 'em.

4
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,825
Yo. Seen Duckett?

5
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:19,992
Yeah, he's inside. He's
fucking off his head.

6
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:22,118
Bro, he's definitely
on something, eh?

7
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:26,868
Hey, is Duckett up there?
Who the fuck is Duckett?

8
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:36,533
Oi! Any of you seen Duckett?

9
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:38,118
No, I haven't!

10
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:45,951
Oi. Oi, seen Duckett?

11
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,200
Cole! Get your
brother under control.

12
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:58,659
- Where is he?
- He's in Jayden's room. Go.

13
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,325
Dude, what's your
brother's deal?

14
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:04,617
Duckett!

15
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:06,825
Open the door, man! I'm
not screwing around.

16
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,992
Mate, I'm this close
to calling the cops.

17
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:11,242
Duckett, open the door
or I'll break it down.

18
00:02:11,243 --> 00:02:13,201
- What?!

19
00:02:14,826 --> 00:02:18,033
Dude, what the hell?! You're
gonna break my mum's door!

20
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:19,658
Nah, fuck this!

21
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:22,201
Cole's breaking my
fuckin'... Duckett.

22
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:26,367
Can you see them?
They're in here.

23
00:02:26,368 --> 00:02:28,408
I'm gonna take
you home. OK, bro?

24
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:31,034
Pop said you're gonna
hurt a lot of people.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Pop's dead, Duckett.
You're not him.
What are you talking about?

26
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:46,117
Bro, look at
Duckett. He's fucked!

27
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:47,784
Are you serious?

28
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:50,326
Put your phones down!

29
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:53,533
Put your fuckin' phones away!

30
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:55,242
Hey, hey, bro...

31
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:56,868
Everyone fuck off!

32
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:03,451
It's a knife!

33
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:38,868
<i>What are you doing?</i>

34
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:52,408
<i>Get off me. Get off!</i>

35
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:54,200
<i>- Mum!</i>

36
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,158
Sorry.

37
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,158
No, I am.

38
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,242
I just needed a moment.

39
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:02,076
Your aunty wants to talk to you.

40
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,701
Yeah, OK.

41
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,493
I've still got her
name in Contacts.

42
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:15,743
I should take her out,
but I just can't do it.

43
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:18,784
Yeah, me neither.

44
00:04:23,993 --> 00:04:25,825
You thought about
what you're gonna do

45
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:27,533
when you finish school?

46
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:28,826
Mmm...

47
00:04:29,826 --> 00:04:31,618
Work with your dad?

48
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:41,576
You getting a cold, Mi?

49
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:44,408
What?

50
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,367
You getting a cold?

51
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:48,451
Uh, yeah, I think so.

52
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:56,283
How was today for you?

53
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:58,325
- What?

54
00:04:58,326 --> 00:05:00,243
How was today for you?

55
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:02,826
Fine.

56
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,742
Hey. <i>Hey, Mia.</i>

57
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:14,492
<i>- Can you come pick me up?</i>
- Oh, OK, now?

58
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:16,408
- Where'd you go?
- I was on the phone.

59
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:18,450
My sister was meant
to be picking me up.

60
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,200
My fat mum's meant
to pick me up.

61
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:22,243
She's probably off
eating dick somewhere.

62
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,783
Is that Alex?

63
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,075
Yeah, his Snapchats
are so cringe.

64
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:31,117
He looks like my
mum in half of 'em.

65
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:34,450
- He looks elvish.
- What's elvish?

66
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:36,284
You know, like
the fantasy elves.

67
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:38,783
Shut up.

68
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:41,200
I swear he stole one
of my cigarettes.

69
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:42,867
You smoke now?

70
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:45,742
Nah, I just sell 'em. I
sold, like, two to him today.

71
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:47,742
He's such a tryhard.

72
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:50,117
He invited me to
his house to hang.

73
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:51,950
I thought you hated him.

74
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,242
Eh.

75
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:55,950
Do you reckon they give
you cancer straightaway?

76
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:57,950
I don't know. Don't smoke it?

77
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:59,618
Don't tell me what to do.

78
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:04,159
Here you go.

79
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,408
Nah.

80
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:11,033
I hate the smell.

81
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:12,618
You're a fuckin' foetus.

82
00:06:13,618 --> 00:06:15,326
I need a new best mate.

83
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:18,534
Put it out, quick.

84
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:25,075
Riley! You little
feral. Cigarettes?

85
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:26,700
We weren't actually
smoking them.

86
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:27,867
He's lying, Mia.

87
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:30,242
- He's had half a packet.
- Need a lift anywhere?

88
00:06:30,243 --> 00:06:32,325
Nah, Mum's getting here
soon. Thanks, though.

89
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,408
Alright. Call Riley if
she doesn't rock up.

90
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:37,117
Alright, thanks. Have
fun with your cancer.

91
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:40,451

You poor thing. What do we do?

104
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:36,825
Do we call a vet?

105
00:07:36,826 --> 00:07:39,325
That's not gonna help,
Riley. I mean, look at it.

106
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,659
We can't just
leave it like that.

107
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:45,326
Can you at least put
it out of its misery?

108
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:47,659
OK.

109
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:16,617
Mia, no, we can't
leave it like this.

110
00:08:16,618 --> 00:08:18,408
Another car will come.

111
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:20,034
Mia, it's crying.

112
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:51,200
- Oh! Hey!

113
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,492
Ow. Love it when you
rock up uninvited.

114
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:55,700
Love it when you forget
to pick up Riley.

115
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,117
Ow!

116
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:59,117
I'm sorry. I had you on mute.

117
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:00,867
Ah, cool story.
I'm telling Mum.

118
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:02,701
No, you're not! Yes, I am!

119
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:05,950
Thanks for picking him up, Mi.

120
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:07,992
All good. Come on, Cookie.

121
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:09,617
Oh, God, you stink!

122
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:11,618
Oh, you're a smelly girl!

123
00:09:26,243 --> 00:09:27,867
Saw a dying kangaroo.

124
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,075
What?

125
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:32,908
On the side of the road.
It was in so much pain.

126
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:34,868
Why didn't you call the RSPCA?

127
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,325
I dunno.

128
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:40,283
It was almost dead.

129
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:42,534
I wanted to put it
out of its misery.

130
00:09:48,118 --> 00:09:50,325
Thanks for ignoring
my calls, by the way.

131
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:53,117
I haven't been ignoring
your calls. I've been busy.

132
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:55,451
Uh, yeah, busy ignoring me.

133
00:09:57,743 --> 00:09:59,742
- No, Jade, don't. Don't!
- What?

134
00:09:59,743 --> 00:10:01,783
Don't answer it! I
let a kangaroo suffer.

135
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:03,659
- Daniel...
- I need consoling!

136
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:06,367
<i>Is that Mia?</i>

137
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:08,408
- I'll call you back, yeah?
<i>- OK, sure.</i>

138
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,533
OK, bye.

139
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:11,992
Bye! Bye, Daniel! Bye!

140
00:10:11,993 --> 00:10:14,993
Oh! Alright. I'm consoling you.

141
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:19,492
- Have you seen the group chat?
- The one I invited you to?

142
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,242
Hayley's video. They're
doing it again tonight.

143
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:23,950
- No, Mia.
- To see if it's real!

144
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:25,909
No, not tonight, Mia. I can't.

145
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:34,659
It was Mum's two years.

146
00:10:35,993 --> 00:10:37,576
That was today?

147
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:40,159
Yeah.

148
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:43,576
I just want to forget about it.

149
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:47,200
And...

150
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:50,034
I need Daniel to come give
my gucci some attention.

151
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:54,950
Oh! Daniel's not
touching your gucci, Mia!

152
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:56,992
He was my boyfriend
before he was yours.

153
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:59,033
You guys held hands
once three years ago.

154
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,617
- That doesn't mean anything.
- Jade.

155
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:05,118
It's my mum's
remembrance day. Please?

156
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,533
Daniel can come, too, yeah?

157
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:15,158
If he's touching my gucci, yes.

158
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,451
- Stop!

159
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:20,325
Can you give me five minutes?

160
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:22,158
What am I gonna do
for five minutes?

161
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,325
Oh, I don't know. Wash
Cookie or something!

162
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:26,492
I don't wanna wash Cookie!

163
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:29,825
Oh, fine! I will babysit
Riley - the better sibling.

164
00:11:29,826 --> 00:11:32,242
Do not talk about your
gucci with Riley, please.

165
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:34,408
He has got to learn!
The boy's got to learn!

166
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:36,492
- Bye.
- Miss you already. Bye.

167
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:38,076
- Love you.

168
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:54,867
"Can I help?"

169
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:57,076
"Yes, Riley, thank
you for asking."

170
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,075
Need a hand?

171
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:10,825
I'm sorry I couldn't
get to your mum's thing.

172
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:12,450
I couldn't get off work.

173
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:13,908
No, it's fine.

174
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:15,493
How's your dad?

175
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:18,367
Oh, hey...

176
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:20,742
You can be honest.

177
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,992
I hate being around him.

178
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,659
He's so depressing.

179
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:28,118
I'm a bad person,
Sue. Can you fix me?

180
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:31,034
You're not broken, Mia.

181
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:34,158
- Whoa. OK.

182
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,158
Ugh, God, I'm dying.

183
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,242
It's just a cold.
You'll kick it.

184
00:12:38,243 --> 00:12:39,742
Thank you.

185
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:41,993
Riley, get your
shit off the table.

186
00:12:44,493 --> 00:12:46,033
Did you hear me?

187
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:48,534
Yes, Mum, I'm coming. OK.

188
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:00,783
Mum? You going to bed?

189
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:03,492
- You sneaking out?
- Why do you always think

190
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,492
I'm sneaking out or
I'm sleeping around?

191
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,325
You only ask if I'm going to
bed when you're sneaking out.

192
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:09,909
Is it to see Daniel?

193
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:13,200
You know, even if it was,
he's ultra Christian.

194
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:16,450
- He doesn't do anything ever.
- He's still got a dick, Jade.

195
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:18,325
Is it him you're
sneaking out to see?

196
00:13:18,326 --> 00:13:20,492
I'm not sneaking out!

197
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:21,951
OK.

198
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:25,243
God. Night.

199
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:28,868
Lock the door on your way out.

200
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,242
- Are we sneaking out now?
- Shh!

201
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:33,867
Bye, Mia.
- Oh, God!

202
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:35,368
I didn't tell on you.

203
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:38,034
What? I didn't do anything.

204
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:42,742
What are you doing?

205
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:44,575
Mia said I could come.

206
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:46,242
How could I say no to him?

207
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,200
- You're not coming.
- Alright, then, I'll tell Mum.

208
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:51,325
Yeah, well, she pretty
much already knows.

209
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:53,243
What, about you
not picking me up?

210
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:57,243
Whatever.

211
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:02,742
- Yo, check this out.

212
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:04,825
- I swear it's fake.
- Mm, I don't know.

213
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:06,575
It's 1,000 per cent a trick.

214
00:14:06,576 --> 00:14:08,992
How would Hayley fake
that? Why would they?

215
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:10,950
Why would they? They're
an attention whore.

216
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,950
They're trying to get
everyone to talk about them

217
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:14,575
and you've fallen for it.

218
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:16,492
Sorry for ruining
your phone date.

219
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:17,950
Apology not accepted.

220
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:19,825
You'll be pregnant
next month, I swear.

221
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,492
Pregnant? He hasn't
even kissed me yet.

222
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:25,575
What? You guys have been going
out for, like, three months.

223
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:28,367
- What is that?
- Even I've kissed Jazzie.

224
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,992
The girl with the horse mouth?

225
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:31,825
You shouldn't be
kissing horses, Riley.

Sick house, Joss.

245
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,367
Yeah.

being weird.

252
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:51,033
You're not being weird.
You just need to loosen up.

253
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,575
Brrr!

254
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,908
Yeah, just do that. It
looks incredibly normal.

255
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:56,325
Brrr!

256
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:57,783
Do that. Brrr!

257
00:15:57,784 --> 00:16:00,200
- Hey, Mia, brrrr!
- Fuck, I love you.

258
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:02,450
- Jade! Oh!
- Daniel!

259
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:03,867
Finally.

260
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:06,451
Um, hi, ex-boyfriend!

261
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:10,075
Group hug.
- Hold me, ex-boyfriend.

262
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:12,658
I am lonely. I
am so, so lonely!

263
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:14,367
You right there, woman?

264
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:16,158
I'm sorry for dragging you out.

265
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,783
Nah. I wasn't doing anything.

266
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:20,283
I actually wanted to get
out of the house for a bit.

267
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:22,451
Wanna come grab a drink?

268
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:25,283
I don't wanna do it.

269
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,701
- They want you to do it.
- I don't wanna do it.

270
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,659
How you been?

271
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,283
Dude, why'd you
have to bring her?

272
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,825
How you going, man?

273
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:37,617
- Good. You?
- Yeah, good, thanks.

274
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:40,242
First, uh, big boys' party, huh?

275
00:16:40,243 --> 00:16:41,867
I don't really know anyone.

276
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,908
You'll know everyone by
the end of the night.

277
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:45,033
Oh, good.

278
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:46,825
- She's fine.
- No, she's not fine.

279
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:48,533
She irritates the
fuck out of me.

280
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:50,283
She's literally
done nothing to you.

281
00:16:50,284 --> 00:16:52,743
She's so clingy, man.
It's fucking depressing.

282
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:56,576
Oh! Now she's flirting
with your boy.

283
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,450
They're friends, Hayley.

284
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,118
You keep telling yourself that.

285
00:17:02,701 --> 00:17:04,493
Alright, let's do this!

286
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:08,993
Yeah, let's fake another video.

287
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:12,451
I've been waiting for this shit!

288
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,368
Be pretty sick to
hook the kid up.

289
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:21,408
He's not doing anything, Joss.

290
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:23,367
Come on, Jade.
Imagine it, though.

291
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:24,992
Joss, I said no.

292
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:27,368
Huh. More for me.

293
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:30,033
Thanks, bro.

294
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:32,200
I guess, uh, I'll
go first and...

295
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,908
Nah, you always go first.

296
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:36,283
It's my house. It's
my fuckin' hand.

297
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:39,117
Duckett gave it to me.
You're a fucking hog!

298
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:40,908
Does anyone else
want to volunteer?

299
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:42,493
I'll do it.

300
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:48,700
You wanna do it? Mm-hm.

301
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,493
- Wanna do it?
- Yeah.

302
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:55,118
- Do you wanna do it?!

303
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:01,368
Sit down, Mia.

304
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:04,450
Better her than me.
- Tie her.

305
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,368
Yes, sir. Hands up.

306
00:18:09,326 --> 00:18:11,408
Mmm, kinky.

307
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:13,159
What are we playing?

308
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:16,575
It's nothing, Riley.
Hayley's tricked everyone.

309
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:18,325
Alright, somebody time it.

310
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:19,950
As soon as she lets it in,

311
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:21,783
it cannot go for
more than 90 seconds.

312
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,117
Am I clear?

313
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:25,326
What happens after 90 seconds?

314
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:28,368
They'll want to stay.

315
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:32,158
And if you die while
they're in you,

316
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,659
well, they'll have you forever.

317
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,617
So lame.

318
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,950
Hey, I'm just relaying
what I've been told, OK?

319
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:42,200
Oh! Fuck, dude!

320
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:45,118
Trust me... it's gotta be tight.

321
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:48,201
Candles?

322
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:51,742
Light the candle
to open the door.

323
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:53,493
Blow it out to close it.

324
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:01,451
OK, Mia.

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Ah...
Put your hand on it.

326
00:19:16,743 --> 00:19:18,368
No, like, hold it.

327
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:24,117
Now say,

328
00:19:24,118 --> 00:19:26,076
"Talk to me."

329
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:28,868
Talk to me.

330
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:35,075
Oh, my God!

331
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:36,784
Oh, my God, what the fuck?!

332
00:19:39,368 --> 00:19:40,908
Who the fuck was that?

333
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,200
Who was that?!

334
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:44,700
I dunno, man. It's
different every time.

335
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,242
- Hey, you signed up.
- Where'd he go?

336
00:19:46,243 --> 00:19:47,825
Mia, stop.

337
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:50,575
No, you didn't do it right.
You gotta say, "I let you in."

338
00:19:50,576 --> 00:19:53,158
No, I'm flipping out.
Seriously, Mia, shut up.

339
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,493
No, someone was sitting
there, I swear to fuck.

340
00:19:58,618 --> 00:20:00,408
OK, I'm proving it.

341
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,201
Attagirl, prove it! Prove
it. That's right, say it.

342
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Do it. Do it.
Do it. Do it. Do it.

343
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,618
Do it! Do it! Do
it! Do it! Do it!

344
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:25,284
- OK! OK. OK.

345
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:30,868
Talk to me.

346
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:34,033
Hey, don't let go, Mia.

347
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,950
- Do not let go.
- I can't look at it!

348
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:37,950
You don't have to look
at it! Just say it.

349
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:40,201
- I can't!
- Say it!

350
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,243
I let you in. I let you in.

351
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:49,576
I let you in.

352
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:56,993
Someone timing it? Got it.

353
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,825
There you are.

354
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:05,993
Shh. Shh-shh-shh-shh.

355
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
There he is.

356
00:21:54,993 --> 00:21:57,659
They like you.

357
00:22:00,201 --> 00:22:01,326
What?

358
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:04,284
Oh, shit! Not you, though.

359
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:13,159
Whoa.

360
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:30,200
Yeah, Mia!

361
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:32,909
He's behind you now.

362
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:38,825
He'll split ya, pretty boy.

363
00:22:38,826 --> 00:22:40,450
He'll split ya!

364
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:42,283
83 seconds. Joss,
get it off her.

365
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:43,992
He'll split ya!

366
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:46,367
- Alright, you've had enough.
- He'll split ya.

367
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:48,743
He'll split ya. He'll split ya.

368
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:53,158
Run. Run.

369
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,908
Run. Run. Run.

370
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:57,325
Run. Run.

371
00:22:57,326 --> 00:23:01,033
Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!

372
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:03,992
- Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
- 90 seconds, for fuck sake!

373
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:07,617
Run! Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!

374
00:23:07,618 --> 00:23:09,826
RUN! RUN! RUN! RUN! RUN!

375
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:16,033
Hey. Hey. You OK?

376
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:17,992
We went a bit over.

377
00:23:17,993 --> 00:23:19,409
Hey.

378
00:23:28,451 --> 00:23:30,908
That was...

379
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,284
amazing!

380
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:38,659
That was the best one yet!

381
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:37,742
Jade. Jade, are you up?

382
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,659
You're not sleeping in here.

383
00:24:40,743 --> 00:24:42,533
I didn't even ask that.

384
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:44,408
Isn't that what you want?

385
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:46,368
No. I'm just bored.

386
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:49,868
Look, Riley, you're not
nine anymore, alright?

387
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:54,868
Goodnight.

388
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:00,076
Can you shut the door?

389
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:03,118
Shut the door!

390
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:08,368
- Sook!

391
00:25:14,243 --> 00:25:15,868
What a bitch.

392
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,158
Can I hang with you?

393
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:20,743
It's your house, bro.

394
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:35,326
Did the hand thing scare you?

395
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:39,034
A bit.

396
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:42,909
You gonna have
nightmares, Riley?

397
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:46,284
I don't get nightmares.

398
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:50,034
I do.

399
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:52,784
Like what?

400
00:25:55,368 --> 00:25:58,118
I have this reoccurring
nightmare...

401
00:25:58,451 --> 00:26:00,034
where...

402
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:03,701
I'm looking in the mirror
and my reflection is gone.

403
00:26:05,326 --> 00:26:07,243
Like I don't exist.

404
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:14,868
What did the hand feel like?

405
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,951
Mmm...

406
00:26:20,034 --> 00:26:21,659
It felt amazing.

407
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:26,326
I felt like I was glowing.

408
00:26:27,826 --> 00:26:32,118
I could hear and see
and feel everything.

409
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:35,534
But I was in the passenger seat.

410
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:39,534
It felt incredible.

411
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:42,659
Mm.

412
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:48,034
How did your mum die?

413
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:53,284
You know.

414
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:55,909
Only bits.

415
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:02,368
She...

416
00:27:04,451 --> 00:27:06,825
took too many sleeping pills.

417
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,409
By accident.

418
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:14,118
Dad was sleeping on the couch.

419
00:27:15,493 --> 00:27:17,868
In the morning, he
couldn't open the door.

420
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:21,618
Mm.

421
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,659
Why?

422
00:27:26,493 --> 00:27:28,868
Mum was on the other side.

423
00:27:31,326 --> 00:27:33,117
And there were
scratches on the door

424
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,951
and wood under her nails.

425
00:27:37,284 --> 00:27:39,576
She tried to get help,
but she couldn't.

426
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:47,784
Jade said you got
depression after.

427
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:52,993
I was just feeling alone.

428
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:56,492
No, you can't ever be alone

429
00:27:56,493 --> 00:27:58,576
'cause you'll always
have me and Jade.

430
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:01,409
Yeah.

431
00:28:02,534 --> 00:28:04,993
It's OK, I don't
feel alone anymore.

432
00:28:23,784 --> 00:28:25,950
<i>Wait. Oh, my God...</i>

433
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:28,242
<i>- Is it being constipated?
- Are you fuckin'...?</i>

434
00:28:28,243 --> 00:28:30,659
<i>He's won a million pounds!</i>

435
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:04,117
- You busy tonight?
- You want a turn, eh?

436
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,575
No. Daniel does.

437
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:08,284
What's in it for me?

438
00:29:09,326 --> 00:29:10,867
My company.

439
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:12,700
That's pretty cool, I reckon.

440
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:15,742
No, we can't go to Joss's. His
place is trashed. He's pissed.

441
00:29:15,743 --> 00:29:17,658
My house, then.

442
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:19,950
I got a party later.
I've gotta be gone by 11.

443
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:22,451
Mum, leaves at 9,
so... See ya at 10.

444
00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:25,743
Jog on.

445
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:33,701
Yeah? Yes!

446
00:29:36,993 --> 00:29:39,284
Hi. Is Jade home?

447
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,908
- Why is Daniel at the door?
- Mum, can you let him in?

448
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:51,783
You'd better not be having a
party, Jade, I swear to God.

449
00:29:51,784 --> 00:29:53,826
It's two friends.
Can you let him in?

450
00:29:59,243 --> 00:30:00,908
What time's everyone
getting here?

451
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:03,617
- Getting here for what?
- The party.

452
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:06,325
- Is there a party tonight?
- Don't bullshit me.

453
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:07,658
I'm... I'm sorry...

454
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:09,367
Have you got
alcohol in your car?

455
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:11,783
Oh, no. I don't drink, so...

456
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:13,701
You're good.

457
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:21,992
What time's the party again?

458
00:30:21,993 --> 00:30:23,617
What party? The party.

459
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:25,283
Jade told me. It's
OK. What time?

460
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,575
I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

461
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,283
The party tonight.
What time is it?

462
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:30,784
There's no party, Mum.

463
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:34,700
You are not drinking tonight.

464
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:37,242
On God, I will punch
you in the face.

465
00:30:37,243 --> 00:30:38,783
Are you drunk?

466
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:39,908
James.

467
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:42,368
If there's a party, I'm
definitely drinking at it.

468
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,951
Is that Cookie or you, James?
Will you crack a window?

469
00:30:50,284 --> 00:30:51,825
Jesus, Mum. Knock much?

470
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:53,825
Mia, if there is
a party tonight,

471
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:56,618
you are banned from this
house, effective immediately.

472
00:30:58,243 --> 00:30:59,909
OK...

473
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:03,450
So, you're just third-wheeling
for the night, are you?

474
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:05,950
It's really humiliating
when you put it that way.

475
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:08,700
You'd better not be
getting stoned again, Mia.

476
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,408
Oh, my God! Why does your
mum have to know everything?

477
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:14,408
I know everything.
- I tried weed one time.

478
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:15,533
You.

479
00:31:15,534 --> 00:31:17,325
My daughter's
vagina - prohibited.

480
00:31:17,326 --> 00:31:20,242
Oh, my God, Mum! Leave the
room before I kill everyone.

481
00:31:20,243 --> 00:31:22,242
The neighbours
tell me everything.

482
00:31:22,243 --> 00:31:23,950
Oh, my God...
- Watch it!

483
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:25,700
Shut the door. Mum!

484
00:31:25,701 --> 00:31:27,492
I'm leaving it open!

485
00:31:27,493 --> 00:31:29,117
I'm so sorry.

486
00:31:29,118 --> 00:31:30,617

That's an ugly fuckin' dog.

498
00:31:57,034 --> 00:31:58,451
Excuse me.

499
00:31:59,826 --> 00:32:01,451
- I'm thirsty.

500
00:32:15,576 --> 00:32:17,450
So, where'd you get
it from, anyway?

501
00:32:17,451 --> 00:32:19,367
I'll tell you what it is, right?

502
00:32:19,368 --> 00:32:22,825
It's the hand of a psychic. Got
cut off and embalmed. Legit.

503
00:32:22,826 --> 00:32:24,825
A medium, Joss. Not a psychic.

504
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:26,700
Yeah, this isn't
an embalmed hand.

505
00:32:26,701 --> 00:32:30,367
Yes, it is, Danny boy. The
ceramic shit is put over it.

506
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:33,117
But if you smash it, there's
an actual hand in there.

507
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,033
- You're full of shit.
- I'm serious.

508
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:36,825
Apparently it was
the hand of someone

509
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:38,492
who could connect with the dead,

510
00:32:38,493 --> 00:32:41,117
so everyone around him thought,
let's cut his hand off.

511
00:32:41,118 --> 00:32:43,200
White people shit,
man, I tell ya.

512
00:32:43,201 --> 00:32:45,533
Oi, I heard it was the
hand of a Satanist.

513
00:32:45,534 --> 00:32:48,825
The other hand's just
out there somewhere.

514
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:50,325
Out where?

515
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:51,950
Shut up, alright?

516
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:54,575
- Fuckin' make me!
- You just talk shit.

517
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:56,242
Alright.

518
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:58,992
Where'd you buy it? Oh,
nah, I didn't buy it.

519
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:01,075
A friend gave it to
a friend and... yeah.

520
00:33:01,076 --> 00:33:03,367
- Who?
- What do you want, Daniel?

521
00:33:03,368 --> 00:33:06,200
A fuckin' spreadsheet with a
transaction history or what?

522
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:07,825
Hold the hand, say "Talk to me"

523
00:33:07,826 --> 00:33:10,408
and ask the spirit your
fuckin' questions, alright?

524
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:12,075
This is such bullshit.

525
00:33:12,076 --> 00:33:13,868
Oi, Riley, get the lights.

526
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,617
Film me?

527
00:33:17,618 --> 00:33:19,784
Yep.
- Oi, time it.

528
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:23,618
OK, champ.

529
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:26,201
You know the drill.

530
00:33:28,534 --> 00:33:30,451
- Say it.

Talk to me.
Whoa!
Oh, what?!
- No way!
- Mate, I don't have all day.
- No. No...

532
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:44,784
What is it?

533
00:33:46,243 --> 00:33:48,033
OK. OK.

534
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:49,783
OK.

535
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:51,450
OK, come on.

536
00:33:51,451 --> 00:33:53,034
OK, come on.

537
00:33:57,743 --> 00:33:59,451
I let you in.

538
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:08,575
Hayley, he's choking.

539
00:34:08,576 --> 00:34:10,534
Hold it.

540
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:14,367
Hayley, fucking stop
it, he's choking!

541
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:15,618
Hold it.

542
00:34:21,034 --> 00:34:23,118
There we go.

543
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,951
He hates it when you touch him.

544
00:34:41,284 --> 00:34:43,534
You make him soft.

545
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:50,076
Yo, this spirit's a cunt.

546
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,992
Oh, fuck!

547
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:23,451
Oh, shit.

548
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:39,118
Ohhh!

549
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:45,034
Oh, no! I can't watch!

550
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:57,908
Oh, fuck! You OK?

551
00:35:57,909 --> 00:35:59,658
Untie me.

552
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:02,283
Untie me, come on.

553
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:03,951
You alright?

554
00:36:05,118 --> 00:36:06,700
Delete it.

555
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:08,783
Delete it, come on!

Can I have a go?

564
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:35,326
Sorry...

No way. Come on, Jade.

You're not my mum.
You're not even 18.

584
00:38:25,576 --> 00:38:27,617
You're not even 15. So what?

585
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:30,493
Jade, please.
- Riley, I said no.

00:38:33,576 --> 00:38:35,533
Fuck sakes.

587
00:38:35,534 --> 00:38:38,617
What if we did it
for, like, 60 seconds?

588
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:41,242
- Mia, stop.
- 60 seconds, Jade.

589
00:38:41,243 --> 00:38:44,075
You don't have to be a bitch
about all things Riley.

590
00:38:44,076 --> 00:38:47,117
Yeah, Jade. You're just so busy
trying to suck Daniel's dick,

591
00:38:47,118 --> 00:38:49,242
you don't give a shit
about anybody else.

592
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:53,325
OK, no. Why do you want to do
it so much? To impress James?

593
00:38:53,326 --> 00:38:55,617
To come into my room
crying that you're scared

594
00:38:55,618 --> 00:38:56,826
like last time?

595
00:38:57,826 --> 00:38:59,576
Did you tell your
little friend that?

596
00:39:01,701 --> 00:39:03,326
I hate you.

597
00:39:04,368 --> 00:39:06,534
Like you're my favourite
person in the world.

598
00:39:09,993 --> 00:39:13,034
Can't help you, bro. Your
sister's fuckin' boring.

599
00:39:17,993 --> 00:39:19,534
Oh, shit, ooh...

600
00:39:22,243 --> 00:39:23,533
- We should go.
- Yeah.

601
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:25,992
- 60 seconds. Please.

602
00:39:25,993 --> 00:39:28,700
I dunno, maybe it's
not a good idea.

603
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:31,992
I actually thought you were
gonna be on my side for once.

604
00:39:31,993 --> 00:39:34,242
Hey... I'm on both
of your sides.

605
00:39:34,243 --> 00:39:35,908
- Obviously not.
- Riley...

606
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:37,618
60 seconds. Please.

607
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:43,868
Please.

608
00:39:44,868 --> 00:39:46,783
OK.

609
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,242
What about 50?

610
00:39:48,243 --> 00:39:49,493
OK. 50.

611
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:52,159
50 seconds?

612
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:56,242
- Yeah, just get it over with.
- Sign the form, baby!

613
00:39:56,243 --> 00:39:58,158
- Let's go!
- Yeah, boy!

614
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,868
OK, hold up, hold up.

615
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:03,575
Hands up.

616
00:40:03,576 --> 00:40:05,200
You alright, kiddo?

617
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:06,575
Yep.

618
00:40:06,576 --> 00:40:08,950
OK. Let's do this.

619
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:12,576
Riley... gettin' crazy!

620
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:15,451
You know what to say, boy.

621
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,450
You better not cry
after 20 seconds.

622
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:23,743
I'll time it.

623
00:40:26,576 --> 00:40:28,118
Talk to me.

624
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:34,034
What the fuck?

625
00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:37,533
Riley.

626
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:39,201
It's OK.

627
00:40:41,493 --> 00:40:42,993
Just say it.

628
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:53,868
I let you in.

629
00:40:56,993 --> 00:40:58,701
Oh, shit.

630
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:14,243
I'm so sorry.

631
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,118
I didn't mean to hurt you.

632
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:28,576
I'd never want to hurt you.

633
00:41:29,784 --> 00:41:32,617
I miss you so...

634
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:34,659
so much, Mi.

635
00:41:39,993 --> 00:41:42,743
I don't want you to hate me.

636
00:41:45,118 --> 00:41:46,201
Mum?

637
00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:50,200
- Hey, that's 50 seconds.
- Please don't close it off.

638
00:41:50,201 --> 00:41:52,076
Mia...
- It's my mum. Please.

639
00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:56,284
I love you both, baby.

640
00:41:58,493 --> 00:42:00,242
I love you too, Mum.

641
00:42:00,243 --> 00:42:03,618
I'm so proud of you.

642
00:42:07,784 --> 00:42:09,617
And I got...

643
00:42:09,618 --> 00:42:12,533
got... got... got...

644
00:42:12,534 --> 00:42:15,575

got, got, got, got...

647
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:34,451
Oh, my God.

648
00:42:39,284 --> 00:42:41,700
No! No, no, Riley!

649
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:43,868
- Riley, stop!

650
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:46,992
Joss, fucking help me!

651
00:42:46,993 --> 00:42:48,618
Get it off him, Joss!

652
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:54,243
Oh, my God.

653
00:43:00,243 --> 00:43:01,993
Riley! Riley!

654
00:43:04,868 --> 00:43:06,492
Fucking help me!

655
00:43:06,493 --> 00:43:08,367
Oi, help, help, help!

656
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:11,533
OK, I'm gonna untie him...
Get him on his side...

657
00:43:11,534 --> 00:43:13,283
Daniel, call an ambulance!

658
00:43:13,284 --> 00:43:15,243
No, no, no, no, no, no...!

659
00:43:21,451 --> 00:43:23,993
James, James, get the
fuckin' bag! Hurry up!

660
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:36,408
Where are you going?
We gotta bounce.

661
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:37,533
No, we can't bounce.

662
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:38,950
We've gotta get out of here.

663
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:40,492
The police are already suss
about the Duckett stabbing.

664
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,367
They're gonna pin this on us.
We let them both do the hand.

665
00:43:42,368 --> 00:43:43,992
We can't just pretend
we weren't here.

666
00:43:43,993 --> 00:43:46,158
We're fucked...
We're fucked if...

667
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,908
We just gotta get
our story straight

668
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:51,409
and make sure everyone sticks
to it. Don't bring up the hand.

669
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:33,493
Excuse me. We need
to talk now, please.

670
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:44,825
<i>Mum, Riley's in hospital.</i>

671
00:44:44,826 --> 00:44:46,450
<i>What? What happened?</i>

672
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:48,242
<i>He smashed his face really bad.</i>

673
00:44:48,243 --> 00:44:51,075
<i>What are you talking about,
"smashed his face"? How?</i>

674
00:44:51,076 --> 00:44:52,742
<i>I don't know. I don't know.</i>

675
00:44:52,743 --> 00:44:54,450
<i>I don't know, I
wasn't in the room!</i>

676
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:57,033
<i>Stop crying and tell
me what happened.</i>

677
00:44:57,034 --> 00:44:59,992
Three or four minutes,
maybe? <i>I'm sorry, Mum.</i>

678
00:44:59,993 --> 00:45:02,826
<i>Jade! Jade,
frickin' answer me!</i>

679
00:45:17,076 --> 00:45:19,283
Can we talk about this?

680
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:20,825
Mia.

681
00:45:20,826 --> 00:45:22,784
Dad, I just want to go to sleep.

682
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:25,659
Can you tell me one thing?

683
00:45:26,868 --> 00:45:28,992
We didn't give him anything.

684
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:30,743
What happened, then?

685
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:34,201
I dunno.

686
00:45:35,576 --> 00:45:37,659
I wish you'd just
be honest with me.

687
00:45:38,784 --> 00:45:41,576
Right, because you've
been so honest with me.

688
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:45,033
What's that supposed to mean?

689
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:48,408
It means there's something
you haven't told me about Mum.

690
00:45:48,409 --> 00:45:49,993
Isn't there?

691
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:56,951
Right.

692
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,825
Tell me he's OK.

693
00:47:10,826 --> 00:47:12,950
No offence, I don't
want you here right now.

694
00:47:12,951 --> 00:47:15,409
Wait, Jade. Come on.

695
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:19,326
Mia.

696
00:47:28,326 --> 00:47:29,408
Sue, I...

697
00:47:29,409 --> 00:47:30,576
Don't!

698
00:47:32,618 --> 00:47:34,367
What are you doing here?

699
00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:36,992
I just... I just came
to see how he was.

700
00:47:36,993 --> 00:47:39,700
He's bad, Mia. He's
really fucking bad.

701
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:42,283
- Did you give him something?
- No.

702
00:47:42,284 --> 00:47:44,950
Come on. I know you've done
shit before. What was it?

703
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:46,576
Nothing, I swear.

704
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:49,742
Look at his face.

705
00:47:49,743 --> 00:47:52,034
What did my son ever do to you?

706
00:47:53,243 --> 00:47:54,783
I... I didn't hurt him.

707
00:47:54,784 --> 00:47:56,408
Go home. Now.

708
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:58,033
No, please, can I just see him?

709
00:47:58,034 --> 00:48:00,408
You come back here, I'm
gonna call the police.

710
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:01,993
Sue...

711
00:48:04,118 --> 00:48:06,158
- Jade.
- Just go home.

712
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:08,243
No, Jade, I'm so sorry...

713
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:29,659
Mum?

714
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,618
Mum, is that you?

715
00:49:33,826 --> 00:49:35,783
Help me!
- Mum?

716
00:49:35,784 --> 00:49:39,408
Mum?

717
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,909
Mum! Mia!

718
00:49:58,618 --> 00:49:59,742
Mia.

719
00:49:59,743 --> 00:50:01,493
- What's wrong?

720
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:06,534
Are you OK?

721
00:50:29,618 --> 00:50:31,118
Was your dad pissed?

722
00:50:32,534 --> 00:50:33,658
Yeah.

723
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:36,909
I'm 18, so the police
didn't call mine.

724
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,743
They can't know.

725
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:43,826
Where do they think you are?

726
00:50:45,284 --> 00:50:46,451
Cousin's.

727
00:50:48,034 --> 00:50:49,950
I can't go home.

728
00:50:49,951 --> 00:50:51,534
They'll know something's up.

729
00:50:54,826 --> 00:50:56,618
You can stay at mine.

730
00:51:07,118 --> 00:51:09,117
Just 'cause of me and Jade.

731
00:51:09,118 --> 00:51:11,325
It might be...

732
00:51:11,326 --> 00:51:13,283
weird.

733
00:51:13,284 --> 00:51:15,908
Yeah, but...

734
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:17,533
we're just friends.

735
00:51:17,534 --> 00:51:19,576
It's not like it's
illegal or anything.

736
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:26,200
I just...

737
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:28,034
I don't want to be alone.

738
00:51:31,826 --> 00:51:33,493
OK.

739
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:42,200
I can't believe I spoke to her.

740
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:44,450
I don't think that
was your mum, Mia.

741
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:46,576
No, it was at first.

742
00:51:47,743 --> 00:51:49,575
She used to call me
'Mi' all the time.

743
00:51:49,576 --> 00:51:51,576
I mean, how would the
spirits know that?

744
00:51:52,868 --> 00:51:55,075
I feel like they read
what we think. You know?

745
00:51:55,076 --> 00:51:57,242
I mean...

746
00:51:57,243 --> 00:51:59,867
they were in us.

747
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:01,826
They could know
everything about us.

748
00:52:04,534 --> 00:52:06,367
Or maybe...

749
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:09,076
Mum was there because she
was trying to reach out.

750
00:52:14,118 --> 00:52:15,826
We could check.

751
00:52:16,993 --> 00:52:18,909
I'm never doing it again, Mia.

752
00:52:20,868 --> 00:52:22,368
Sorry.

753
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:33,908
Forgot about that.

754
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:37,075
- I was such a loser.
- You were cute.

755
00:52:37,076 --> 00:52:39,200
Remember when we held hands?

756
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:41,158
Yeah.

757
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:44,033
I could feel your heart beating
through your fingertips.

758
00:52:44,034 --> 00:52:46,825
You paid me out 'cause your
hands were bigger than mine.

759
00:52:46,826 --> 00:52:49,284
- And they probably still are.
- No way.

760
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:57,450
It is. You have
the tiniest hands.

761
00:52:57,451 --> 00:53:00,326
Yeah, I... I didn't
do puberty right.

762
00:54:16,868 --> 00:54:18,743
<i>No, wait, Jade...</i>

763
00:54:36,951 --> 00:54:38,575
<i>Mum.</i>

764
00:54:38,576 --> 00:54:40,659
<i>What's your message
to the haters?</i>

765
00:54:41,743 --> 00:54:44,617
<i>Suck my arse! Mm-hm!</i>

766
00:54:44,618 --> 00:54:46,283
<i>Mum!</i>

767
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:48,784
<i>Get off me. Get off!</i>

768
00:54:51,493 --> 00:54:52,867
<i>Who's the cutest?</i>

769
00:54:52,868 --> 00:54:54,658
<i>Me. Me.
- Me.</i>

770
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,783
<i>- Who's the hottest?
- Me.</i>

771
00:54:56,784 --> 00:54:58,825
<i>Who's the best? Me!</i>

772
00:54:58,826 --> 00:55:00,992
<i>Who's the funniest? Me.</i>

773
00:55:00,993 --> 00:55:02,492
<i>You suck!</i>

774
00:55:02,493 --> 00:55:03,950
<i>You suck!</i>

775
00:55:03,951 --> 00:55:06,076
<i>- Fuck the haters!</i>

776
00:57:05,743 --> 00:57:08,075
Please... No. No, Rhea...

777
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:10,409
Rhea...

778
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,243
Daniel?

779
00:58:44,784 --> 00:58:47,909
Daniel! Daniel, wake up!

780
00:58:49,118 --> 00:58:51,325
Daniel, wake up!

781
00:58:51,326 --> 00:58:54,283
Daniel!

782
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:56,826
Wake up!

783
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,867
Oh, what the...?! Mia!

784
00:59:00,868 --> 00:59:02,368
- Stop!

785
00:59:04,243 --> 00:59:07,326
Where is she? Oh,
my God, oh, my God!

786
00:59:08,993 --> 00:59:10,367
Oh, my God, they followed us.

787
00:59:10,368 --> 00:59:11,867
Whoever we contacted,
they followed us.

788
00:59:11,868 --> 00:59:14,533
- What are you talking about?
- She was sucking your foot!

789
00:59:14,534 --> 00:59:17,367
- You had my foot in your mouth!
- What? No, I didn't.

790
00:59:17,368 --> 00:59:19,075
- I'm gonna go.
- Wait, Daniel...

791
00:59:19,076 --> 00:59:20,825
- Mia, stop!
- No, don't leave me!

792
00:59:20,826 --> 00:59:22,701
- No, I'm going.
- Stay with me.

793
01:00:16,659 --> 01:00:18,659
Mum?

794
01:00:20,118 --> 01:00:22,368
Mum.

795
01:00:25,868 --> 01:00:28,159
Please, please, Mum.

796
01:00:30,034 --> 01:00:31,534
Talk to me.

797
01:00:42,868 --> 01:00:44,618
Mum.

798
01:00:55,909 --> 01:00:58,742
Did you...

799
01:00:58,743 --> 01:01:00,826
Did you kill yourself?

800
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:04,950
No.

801
01:01:04,951 --> 01:01:07,243
Not on purpose, Mi.

802
01:01:09,326 --> 01:01:11,243
Is that the truth?

803
01:01:12,534 --> 01:01:15,617
I'd never want to leave you.

804
01:01:15,618 --> 01:01:17,409
Ever.

805
01:01:19,451 --> 01:01:21,409
I'm here.

806
01:01:22,618 --> 01:01:24,118
Always.

807
01:01:32,701 --> 01:01:34,493
Mia.

808
01:01:36,118 --> 01:01:38,493
Riley needs help.

809
01:02:36,201 --> 01:02:39,158
Oh, your father. Unbelievable.

810
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:41,493
Can you stay with him, Jade?

811
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

812
01:02:54,618 --> 01:02:56,201
Riley.

813
01:02:57,951 --> 01:03:00,243
Riley, please say something.

814
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:05,993
Riley?

815
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:08,951
Riley.

816
01:03:18,201 --> 01:03:19,658
Mum! Mum!

817
01:03:19,659 --> 01:03:22,701
No, Riley, stop! Riley, stop!

818
01:03:24,326 --> 01:03:26,368
Stop! Stop!

819
01:03:30,034 --> 01:03:31,783
Stop!

820
01:03:31,784 --> 01:03:33,409
Stop!

821
01:03:40,576 --> 01:03:42,408
Riley!

822
01:03:42,409 --> 01:03:44,242
Oh, shit!

823
01:03:44,243 --> 01:03:47,618
Stop! Nurse!

824
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:51,451
Please stop him!
Please stop him!

825
01:03:55,826 --> 01:03:59,909
Riley, fucking stop now!
Fucking stop him! Do something!

826
01:04:05,618 --> 01:04:08,742
It was you who took it. You
could've said something, Mia.

827
01:04:08,743 --> 01:04:10,408
Who showed the police the video?

828
01:04:10,409 --> 01:04:11,950
Think it was James.

829
01:04:11,951 --> 01:04:14,075
Least it proves we
didn't touch him.

830
01:04:14,076 --> 01:04:16,033
Police said there's
not a lot they can do.

831
01:04:16,034 --> 01:04:17,783
Has it ever lasted this long?

832
01:04:17,784 --> 01:04:18,908
No.

833
01:04:18,909 --> 01:04:21,408
But we've never been over
90 seconds before Mia, so...

834
01:04:21,409 --> 01:04:23,493
How is he?

835
01:04:24,743 --> 01:04:27,159
Every time he comes to,
he tries to kill himself.

836
01:04:28,368 --> 01:04:30,783
They wanna keep him. What?

837
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,575
The guy who gave
Duckett the hand said

838
01:04:32,576 --> 01:04:35,617
that if you die while they're
in you, they have you forever.

839
01:04:35,618 --> 01:04:39,451
Have any of you guys...
still been seeing stuff?

840
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:42,950
What the fuck you
mean, "seeing stuff"?

841
01:04:42,951 --> 01:04:45,076
I saw my mum at the hospital.

842
01:04:46,784 --> 01:04:49,534
And another one attacked
Daniel at my house.

843
01:04:50,534 --> 01:04:53,742
Did you see something?
Uh... not exactly.

844
01:04:53,743 --> 01:04:55,908
What's that supposed
to mean, Daniel?

845
01:04:55,909 --> 01:04:59,076
I woke up and Mia was...

846
01:05:00,868 --> 01:05:02,368
I dunno...

847
01:05:03,493 --> 01:05:05,117
sucking my feet.

848
01:05:05,118 --> 01:05:06,618
The fuck?

849
01:05:07,618 --> 01:05:08,658
Jade.

850
01:05:08,659 --> 01:05:10,492
What do you mean,
"woke up with Mia"?

851
01:05:10,493 --> 01:05:12,283
What do you mean,
"sucking your feet"?

852
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:14,158
It wasn't me.
- I couldn't go home.

853
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:16,325
None of us have
been seeing shit.

854
01:05:16,326 --> 01:05:17,867
We all did it. We
were all there.

855
01:05:17,868 --> 01:05:20,492
Why would you see your mum?
You didn't even let her in.

856
01:05:20,493 --> 01:05:23,325
Wait, didn't Duckett say
they could imitate people?

857
01:05:23,326 --> 01:05:25,034
Wait, who's Duckett?

858
01:05:26,534 --> 01:05:28,700
I got the hand
off him. He, uh...

859
01:05:28,701 --> 01:05:31,617
I met him twice at
some parties and...

860
01:05:31,618 --> 01:05:34,492
yeah, we did the hand shit,
I asked if I could borrow it

861
01:05:34,493 --> 01:05:36,284
and he said I could keep it.

862
01:05:39,243 --> 01:05:41,034
He said he was seeing
them without it.

863
01:05:42,076 --> 01:05:43,950
And then he went full skitz.

864
01:05:43,951 --> 01:05:46,950
Stabbed his brother,
then killed himself.

865
01:05:46,951 --> 01:05:49,826
The brother. Can
we talk to him?

866
01:05:59,034 --> 01:06:01,117
What's up, bruz?

867
01:06:01,118 --> 01:06:03,033
What are you doing here?

868
01:06:03,034 --> 01:06:04,743
We gotta talk about Duckett.

869
01:06:06,493 --> 01:06:07,993
Yeah.

870
01:06:09,076 --> 01:06:11,242
Do you know what
the shit thing is?

871
01:06:11,243 --> 01:06:13,242
He actually thought
he had friends.

872
01:06:13,243 --> 01:06:15,117
You guys always
inviting him to shit,

873
01:06:15,118 --> 01:06:16,950
acting like you cared.

874
01:06:16,951 --> 01:06:19,575
- But you were using him.
- We weren't using him, Cole.

875
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:21,825
A real friend would've
seen it was fucking him up.

876
01:06:21,826 --> 01:06:23,283
- But you didn't.

877
01:06:23,284 --> 01:06:25,742
Look, bruz, I know it's
a shit time for you,

878
01:06:25,743 --> 01:06:27,367
but we need your help.

879
01:06:27,368 --> 01:06:29,242
Nah, man, I'm out.

880
01:06:29,243 --> 01:06:30,618
Cole.

881
01:07:05,576 --> 01:07:09,243
I know how much it hurts
to lose someone that close.

882
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,493
The people he let in
messed up his head.

883
01:07:22,493 --> 01:07:24,283
If he'd stopped doing
that fucking thing,

884
01:07:24,284 --> 01:07:25,533
they would've left.

885
01:07:25,534 --> 01:07:29,117
My little brother's in
hospital. He went way over.

886
01:07:29,118 --> 01:07:30,826
You let a kid do it?

887
01:07:34,618 --> 01:07:36,283
His body should kick 'em out.

888
01:07:36,284 --> 01:07:38,200
They get weaker the
longer they're in.

889
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:39,908
It hasn't. Give it time.

890
01:07:39,909 --> 01:07:41,201
They're killing him.

891
01:07:42,201 --> 01:07:43,325
Maybe it's time

892
01:07:43,326 --> 01:07:45,325
you stop fucking up
people's lives, Joss.

893
01:07:45,326 --> 01:07:47,201
What do you reckon?

894
01:07:53,618 --> 01:07:54,658
Jade!

895
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:56,658
Jade, just wait! Jade!

896
01:07:56,659 --> 01:07:58,575
You shouldn't have
let him do it, Mia!

897
01:07:58,576 --> 01:08:00,158
We all decided it'd be OK.

898
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,825
We didn't decide anything.

899
01:08:01,826 --> 01:08:03,158
We did. We all said...

900
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:04,950
We didn't say shit,
Mia. That was you.

901
01:08:04,951 --> 01:08:06,783
You let it go for
two fucking minutes.

902
01:08:06,784 --> 01:08:09,533
You sleep with my boyfriend.
What the fuck's wrong with you?

903
01:08:09,534 --> 01:08:12,409
- Jade, it wasn't like that.
- Of course you take her side.

904
01:08:14,243 --> 01:08:15,576
Jesus...

905
01:08:17,868 --> 01:08:22,409
I wish that you didn't force
yourself into my family, Mia.

906
01:08:26,034 --> 01:08:27,534
Um...

907
01:08:29,701 --> 01:08:31,825
Did we blow the candle out?

908
01:08:31,826 --> 01:08:33,409
I don't remember.

909
01:08:34,409 --> 01:08:36,742
What if we opened the door
but we didn't shut it?

910
01:08:36,743 --> 01:08:38,325
What are you saying?

911
01:08:38,326 --> 01:08:41,075
We do it again with Riley but
blow out the candle this time.

912
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:42,533
You want him to do it again?

913
01:08:42,534 --> 01:08:43,783
The thing that put
him in hospital?

914
01:08:43,784 --> 01:08:45,783
- You wanna save him?
- Don't fucking ask me that.

915
01:08:45,784 --> 01:08:47,368
We have to do something, Jade!

916
01:09:00,076 --> 01:09:01,867
I'll give it back after, OK?

917
01:09:01,868 --> 01:09:03,659
Just burn the fuckin' thing.

918
01:09:04,743 --> 01:09:06,576
Hey, good luck.

919
01:09:29,034 --> 01:09:30,908
Mum's back in, like, an hour.

920
01:09:30,909 --> 01:09:32,159
We'll be quick.

921
01:09:50,743 --> 01:09:52,368
Oh, my God.

922
01:10:08,701 --> 01:10:10,618
Come on, Riley.
Come on, please.

923
01:10:19,284 --> 01:10:20,951
Talk to him.

924
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,409
OK, yeah, blow it out.

925
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:31,368
Anything?

926
01:10:32,368 --> 01:10:34,700
I don't know. Um...

927
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:36,325
Maybe if we just try it again.

928
01:10:36,326 --> 01:10:37,993
Mia...
- Just try it again.

929
01:10:45,243 --> 01:10:46,743
Talk to him.

930
01:10:49,951 --> 01:10:52,200
It's not working.

931
01:10:52,201 --> 01:10:54,159
OK. Um...

932
01:10:56,701 --> 01:10:58,617
What if I use the
hand to speak to him?

933
01:10:58,618 --> 01:11:00,533
No.
- What? He's not dead, Mi.

934
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:03,117
But what if his spirit is
disconnected from his body?

935
01:11:03,118 --> 01:11:04,825
I thought these
spirits were in limbo.

936
01:11:04,826 --> 01:11:07,367
- Maybe that's where Riley is.
- Might not be him.

937
01:11:07,368 --> 01:11:09,117
- What if it is?
- What if it isn't?

938
01:11:09,118 --> 01:11:10,783
This is a bad idea, Mia.

939
01:11:10,784 --> 01:11:11,992
Mia.

940
01:11:11,993 --> 01:11:13,534
Mia, don't.

941
01:11:15,868 --> 01:11:18,826
Riley, talk to me.

942
01:11:26,951 --> 01:11:28,325
Hi.

943
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:29,993
Is it him?

944
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,076
Is there a boy here?

945
01:11:36,118 --> 01:11:37,451
Him.

946
01:11:39,576 --> 01:11:41,409
Do you know where he is?

947
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:46,701
Please.

948
01:11:47,701 --> 01:11:49,409
I can take you to him.

949
01:11:50,493 --> 01:11:52,284
OK.

950
01:11:54,784 --> 01:11:56,451
I let you in.

951
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:06,118
Help!

952
01:12:12,118 --> 01:12:14,450
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey. You OK?

953
01:12:14,451 --> 01:12:16,825
No! Don't touch me!

954
01:12:16,826 --> 01:12:18,908
Don't touch me!

955
01:12:18,909 --> 01:12:20,533
Hey, hey, hey.

956
01:12:20,534 --> 01:12:21,867
Hey.

957
01:12:21,868 --> 01:12:23,700
- It's just us.

958
01:12:23,701 --> 01:12:25,326
It's just me and Daniel.

959
01:12:26,659 --> 01:12:28,325
What happened?

960
01:12:28,326 --> 01:12:29,951
I saw him.

961
01:12:31,118 --> 01:12:32,951
They're hurting him, Jade.

962
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:36,117
They're not gonna stop.

963
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:38,534
They're never gonna stop.

964
01:12:59,701 --> 01:13:01,201
Mia.

965
01:13:04,534 --> 01:13:07,118
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

966
01:13:09,201 --> 01:13:10,951
But I want to be.

967
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:30,908
Your mother...

968
01:13:30,909 --> 01:13:34,408
before she passed,
she left us something.

969
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:36,408
Something I've been
scared to show you.

970
01:13:36,409 --> 01:13:38,200
Which is wrong of me.

971
01:13:38,201 --> 01:13:41,826
Because it's... it's just as
much as yours as it is mine.

972
01:13:44,576 --> 01:13:46,326
Can I read it to you?

973
01:14:04,409 --> 01:14:06,326
"Dear Max and Mia.

974
01:14:08,618 --> 01:14:10,992
"It's Tuesday today

975
01:14:10,993 --> 01:14:13,492
"and it's raining.

976
01:14:13,493 --> 01:14:17,283
"It's the first
time in a long time

977
01:14:17,284 --> 01:14:19,243
"I haven't felt hopeless.

978
01:14:22,493 --> 01:14:24,243
"In fact...

979
01:14:25,784 --> 01:14:28,368
"I am full of hope.

980
01:14:31,409 --> 01:14:35,742
"I hope you live
beyond your years

981
01:14:35,743 --> 01:14:38,368
"and find absolute happiness.

982
01:14:43,576 --> 01:14:46,284
"I hope you... I hope you
don't hate me for this."

983
01:14:47,659 --> 01:14:50,326
"I hope you find it in
your heart to forgive me.

984
01:14:52,076 --> 01:14:55,992
"I hope you can find
some peace in knowing

985
01:14:55,993 --> 01:14:58,159
"I am no longer in pain."

986
01:15:01,909 --> 01:15:03,951
I'm sorry, Mi.

987
01:15:06,993 --> 01:15:09,033
- It's hers, Mia.
- No.

988
01:15:09,034 --> 01:15:11,076
It's OK.

989
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:13,825
No, she didn't do it.

990
01:15:13,826 --> 01:15:16,075
She didn't do it,
because she told me, Dad.

991
01:15:16,076 --> 01:15:18,409
She didn't do it,
because she told me.

992
01:15:19,618 --> 01:15:21,867
She told me. She told me.

993
01:15:21,868 --> 01:15:23,700
- Mia.

994
01:15:23,701 --> 01:15:25,783
Mia. Come here.

995
01:15:25,784 --> 01:15:27,283
Sweetheart.

996
01:15:27,284 --> 01:15:29,576
- She's gone.

997
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:34,451
I'm sorry I kept it from you.

998
01:15:37,159 --> 01:15:39,743
I didn't want you
blaming yourself.

999
01:15:46,868 --> 01:15:48,493
It's not true.

1000
01:15:59,951 --> 01:16:01,575
I'll be back.

1001
01:16:01,576 --> 01:16:03,159
What?

1002
01:16:05,034 --> 01:16:06,742
- I'll be back, I promise.
- Mi...

1003
01:16:06,743 --> 01:16:09,993
I promise. I just gotta... I'll
be back, Dad. I'll be back.

1004
01:16:13,618 --> 01:16:15,242
Mi.

1005
01:16:15,243 --> 01:16:17,492
He's lying.

1006
01:16:17,493 --> 01:16:20,075
Then why did you
write it? I didn't.

1007
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:22,033
Sweetheart.

1008
01:16:22,034 --> 01:16:24,118
That's not your dad.

1009
01:16:25,659 --> 01:16:26,868
What?

1010
01:16:31,034 --> 01:16:32,701
Mia?

1011
01:16:33,993 --> 01:16:35,950
That's not Max.

1012
01:16:35,951 --> 01:16:37,450
Mia?

1013
01:16:37,451 --> 01:16:39,076
They're imitating him.

1014
01:16:42,576 --> 01:16:44,908
He's going to hurt you.

1015
01:16:44,909 --> 01:16:46,993
Mia, open the door!

1016
01:16:55,409 --> 01:16:58,200
Riley can't stay there.

1017
01:16:58,201 --> 01:17:00,617
Mia?
- He's suffering, Mi.

1018
01:17:00,618 --> 01:17:02,826
What... what do I do?

1019
01:17:04,618 --> 01:17:06,367
He needs to die.

1020
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:07,867
What? Mia?

1021
01:17:07,868 --> 01:17:10,117
You have to put him
out of his misery.

1022
01:17:10,118 --> 01:17:12,325
No, Mum, I-I-I can't. I can't.

1023
01:17:12,326 --> 01:17:14,450
They're never gonna let him go.

1024
01:17:14,451 --> 01:17:17,075
- No, Mum, please, no...

1025
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'll look after him, Mi.
Open the damn door!
Help him, Mia.
Let me in!

1026
01:17:24,826 --> 01:17:27,033
Help him, Mia!

1027
01:17:27,034 --> 01:17:28,618
Just leave me alone!

1028
01:18:00,784 --> 01:18:02,242
Mia!

1029
01:18:02,243 --> 01:18:04,451
- Mia!
- Help me!

1030
01:18:05,993 --> 01:18:07,534
I'm trying!

1031
01:18:17,451 --> 01:18:18,784
Mia!

1032
01:18:32,659 --> 01:18:34,659
- Oh, my God.

1033
01:19:20,493 --> 01:19:21,825
<i>Hey.</i>

1034
01:19:21,826 --> 01:19:23,700
Jade?

1035
01:19:23,701 --> 01:19:25,409
<i>You OK?</i>

1036
01:19:28,368 --> 01:19:29,951
I know what to do.

1037
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:33,368
We can save him.

1038
01:19:34,993 --> 01:19:37,700
You know, I actually
think he's getting better.

1039
01:19:37,701 --> 01:19:39,575
He woke up for a second.

1040
01:19:39,576 --> 01:19:41,992
It's like he was himself again.

1041
01:19:41,993 --> 01:19:43,868
I've seen him, Jade.

1042
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:46,784
He's in pain.

1043
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:51,201
And every second
is agony for him.

1044
01:19:53,659 --> 01:19:55,743
Just come to mine.

1045
01:19:57,409 --> 01:19:59,075
<i>And I'll show you.</i>

1046
01:19:59,076 --> 01:20:01,158
Show me what?

1047
01:20:01,159 --> 01:20:03,409
<i>You just have to be here, Jade.</i>

1048
01:20:04,409 --> 01:20:06,076
<i>Please.</i>

1049
01:20:07,159 --> 01:20:09,409
<i>- Just trust me.</i>
- Oh, shit.

1050
01:20:10,576 --> 01:20:13,034
OK. I'll be there in 10.

1051
01:21:01,743 --> 01:21:02,784
Mia.

1052
01:21:06,243 --> 01:21:07,825
I'm... I'm sorry.

1053
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:09,409
No, it's OK. Sit.

1054
01:21:18,118 --> 01:21:20,908
I was wondering when
I'd see you again.

1055
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,576
You haven't come.

1056
01:21:24,409 --> 01:21:25,909
You told me not to.

1057
01:21:27,076 --> 01:21:28,659
I know. I was mad.

1058
01:21:30,743 --> 01:21:33,117
You had every right to be.

1059
01:21:33,118 --> 01:21:34,784
Still do.

1060
01:21:36,368 --> 01:21:37,951
No, I don't.

1061
01:21:39,368 --> 01:21:41,368
There were no drugs, Mia.

1062
01:21:43,076 --> 01:21:47,243
He had a breakdown. I just...
I just... couldn't face that.

1063
01:21:48,743 --> 01:21:50,575
I'm so sorry that I blamed you.

1064
01:21:50,576 --> 01:21:53,159
I know that you wouldn't
do anything to hurt him.

1065
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:55,868
I love you guys.

1066
01:21:56,993 --> 01:21:59,784
You're not Riley's friend,
Mia - you're his family.

1067
01:22:01,659 --> 01:22:04,409
It'd mean so much to
him that you were here.

1068
01:22:19,909 --> 01:22:21,868
Can I have a minute with him?

1069
01:22:22,993 --> 01:22:24,450
