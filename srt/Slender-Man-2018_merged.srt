00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,395
Nice, easy
mile now, warm it up!

3
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:36,066
- Take your time.
- Hurry up!

4
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:39,067
Aww.

5
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:41,472
It'd be so much cuter if you
were wearing little shoes.

6
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:43,772
It'd be cuter if
he exploded at the end.

7
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:48,444
- Excuse me.
- Bless you.

8
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:50,279
- You know...
- Black lung.

9
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:51,614
Did you know that pilgrims
used to think sneezing

10
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,248
meant you were
expelling demons?

11
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,751
- What?
- That's why I never sneeze.

12
00:01:55,753 --> 00:01:57,320
I want to keep them all

13
00:01:57,322 --> 00:01:58,855
- in my soul.
- Your soul.

14
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:01,191
If I had one.

15
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:03,126
<i>Twitter poll.</i>

16
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:04,494
If you could stay one age
forever, what would it be?

17
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:07,663
- Easy. 21.
- No way. I'd be 10.

18
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:09,431
Oh, no, 10 was
the worst, man.

19
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:12,001
I say, 30. It's like
the height of sophistication.

20
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:14,135
- You?
- What about the age we are right now?

21
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:15,638
I'd like to stay
like this forever.

22
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,539
Seriously? I mean,
what's wrong with you?

23
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,943
Okay, fine.
The age we are right now,

24
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:21,811
but we could all live
in a house together.

25
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:23,346
Okay, fine.
But without Wren, though?

26
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:25,181
Yeah, obviously,
that goes without saying.

27
00:02:25,183 --> 00:02:27,283
Super funny.
Like, whoa.

28
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:31,221
Guys, the
dudebros in their natural habitat.

29
00:02:31,223 --> 00:02:33,823
Let's observe, shall we?

30
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:36,325
Hey, Tom!
So, what's the plan tonight?

31
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:38,694
- Big plans...
- Hey.

32
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:41,698
- It's top secret.
- Oh, I see. A circle jerk?

33
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:45,068
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hey, Kyle.

34
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,302
So, what's the big secret?

35
00:02:47,304 --> 00:02:49,138
I mean, I could tell you,

36
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,508
but then, I'd have to kill you.

37
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,741
- Okay, buddy.
- Yeah.

38
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:54,843
Yeah. It's very intriguing.

39
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:58,046
You guys, I got to go get my
sister, but I love you. Bye.

40
00:02:58,048 --> 00:02:59,548
See you later.
I'll pick you up tonight.

41
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,381
- I'm sorry.
- Bye. It's okay.

42
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,397
Bumped into
Coach Sanders today.

43
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:22,204
Said your 1,600-meter time
is really improving.

44
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:28,641
All that training's
paying off.

45
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,576
Nice work, sweetheart.

46
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:33,813
Did you tell them Delores
Constantino quit the team?

47
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:34,816
Why?

48
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,752
She's pregnant.

49
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:43,155
What is she
planning to do, now?

50
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:45,226
She's gonna drop out,
and keep the baby.

51
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:52,532
I assume Wren is gonna be
at Katie's tonight?

52
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:54,500
Yeah. So?

53
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:55,737
So, what are you guys
gonna do?

54
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,873
You know, drink a lot of
vodka, and meet guys online.

55
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,609
Funny. Very funny.

56
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:06,010
- Can I come?
- Not a chance.

57
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,480
- You said I could come next time.
- I lied.

58
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,590
- Hey.
- Hey.

59
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,725
Do you think I could
hang out with you guys?

60
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:23,129
Uh, yeah,
not tonight, grasshopper.

61
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:24,930
Sorry. Maybe next time.

62
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,132
Oh, I wore the shirt
you gave me to school.

63
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,667
Got sent
to the principal's office.

64
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,002
- Well done, man. Yes.
- Hey.

65
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,203
- Hey.
- Goodbye.

66
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,573
Bye.

67
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:35,674
Love me.

68
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:36,712
Bye, Lizzie.

69
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,302
- Hey.
- Hey.

70
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,939
Don't make any noise.
It's dormant.

71
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:08,943
Just another exciting Friday
night at the Jensens.

72
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,451
<i>No? Oh?</i>

73
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:20,218
Yeah, it's girl gaze porn.

74
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,586
You know how they have POV porn?

75
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,254
- Yeah.
- This one's from our perspective.

76
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,357
- I don't want to see that.
- For sure.

77
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,160
Oh, my God.

78
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:28,728
Do you think she likes that?

79
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,429
- Oh, my God!
- No!

80
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,430
Oh, God! Once you see it,
you just can't unsee it.

81
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,771
What the hell is he doing?

82
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,507
He's probably just
looking for another bottle.

83
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,643
- Sometimes, I wish I could just leave.
- I know.

84
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:48,881
Why don't we just all leave? Get
out of this stupid town together.

85
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,083
Where would we go?

86
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:54,853
I have friends in Paris. We
could totally stay with them.

87
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,323
What friends?
You've never been to Paris.

88
00:05:57,325 --> 00:06:01,360
- My mom has friends there, idiot.
- Don't I wish.

89
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:04,429
I'll just be stuck here
forever, in this shithole.

90
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:13,538
Seriously! No, I think you and
Carl would make an adorable couple.

91
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,242
It's "Kyle,"
and I don't like him.

92
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:19,612
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever, you know.

93
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:21,680
But we all know
that you wish you were

94
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,449
at their little secret
sausage fest right now.

95
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,218
No.

96
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,454
But I do know
what their secret is.

97
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,256
Oh, yeah? Do tell.

98
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,492
So, they're getting together
tonight at Tom's house

99
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:36,498
in his garage,
to summon Slender Man.

100
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:40,232
- Creepy.
- Who's Slender Man?

101
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,869
Yeah, he's the guy who makes
all those kids disappear.

102
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:44,369
Why have I not heard of this?

103
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,805
That's a much
longer conversation.

104
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,307
- Listen.
- Troll...

105
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:53,345
"Slender Man can manifest
in a variety of forms.

106
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,881
"Certain accounts speak
of a hypnotic power

107
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:59,151
"that renders his victims
helpless to stop themselves

108
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:04,189
"from walking into
waiting arms.

109
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,692
"While his origins and motives
are completely unknown,

110
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,629
"he preys upon innocent youth.

111
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,398
"Once you see him, you're his.

112
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,936
"Some he takes,
some he doesn't.

113
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:22,574
"Nobody knows why he takes who he
takes, or why he leaves who he leaves.

114
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:26,881
"But the ones he leaves behind
are messed up forever."

115
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:32,154
All right, here it is.
"How to summon Slender Man."

116
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:39,628
- Guys, we so have to do this.
- We actually don't.

117
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,893
Actually.

118
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,297
If they're doing it,
we're doing it.

119
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:46,064
This feels wrong.
This feels like

120
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,434
Russian malware-y
virus-type shit.

121
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:50,105
Come on,
don't be such a wuss.

122
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,045
"Those who hear
the three bells toll

123
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:01,247
"accept his invitation.

124
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:04,216
"When you hear the first,
you must close your eyes,

125
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,218
"keeping words unspoken.

126
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,622
"If one wants to hear,
you must listen closely,

127
00:08:09,624 --> 00:08:12,223
"for they are soft
and distant.

128
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,826
"With eyes still closed
and mind wide open,

129
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,795
"clear your thoughts
and await the second,

130
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,869
"opening your eyes only once
you've heard the third."

131
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:24,773
Hmm.

132
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,113
Are you serious? This is...

133
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:08,216
Shh!

134
00:09:57,064 --> 00:10:00,200
What a stupid video. Honestly.

135
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:22,254
Can we do
something else?

136
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,325
- Let's watch a movie.
- Yeah.

137
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,668
This burial ground dates back

138
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,504
all the way
to the Revolutionary War,

139
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:22,140
which was 1775 to 1783.

140
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:26,812
In 2004, it was put on the National
Registry of Historical Sites,

141
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:29,413
which was very exciting.

142
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,850
Initially, all of this land
belonged to Thomas Clifton,

143
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:37,022
who left it to the town of
Winsford in his will in 1674.

144
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:43,861
You guys, I threw up twice this
morning, before I got on the bus.

145
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,898
Is it Carl's?

146
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,571
Ha. That's hilarious, and also,
scientifically impossible.

147
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:52,605
Have you been
having nightmares?

148
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,772
Mmm-mmm.

149
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,173
Have you?

150
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,176
Uh...

151
00:12:57,078 --> 00:12:58,911
About what?

152
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:04,182
It's nothing, really.
It's just that video.

153
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:07,454
...stronger and
more durable, which is also...

154
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:13,359
Hey, Katie?

155
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:16,131
Katie, are you okay?

156
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:18,366
Yes.

157
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,422
Katie? Cut this shit out, man.

158
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:20,091
All right, we're all prisoners
because of you.

159
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,826
So, none of you saw
where she went?

160
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,196
- No.
- Really?

161
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,700
- Damn it.
- I mean, where is she?

162
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:30,804
Yeah, she still hasn't
answered any of my texts.

163
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:35,309
Why are the police here?

164
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,015
Oh, shit.

165
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,552
You see her?

166
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,690
Mmm-mmm.

167
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:24,121
<i>Teenager Katie
Jensen was last seen on Wednesday,</i>

168
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,392
<i>during a school field trip to
the historic Clifton Cemetery.</i>

169
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,861
<i>As of now,
local police have no leads,</i>

170
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:32,330
<i>but are questioning friends
and family members</i>

171
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,701
<i>in hopes of gaining insight into
the reason for her disappearance.</i>

172
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:39,941
<i>Citizens with any information are being
urged to contact local authorities.</i>

173
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,746
You should tell me
what really happened to Katie.

174
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:50,382
We never keep secrets
from each other.

175
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:53,652
How would you know? You don't know that.
Do your homework.

176
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:55,821
Come on,
I don't want to talk about it.

177
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:59,126
It was a boy, right? You think I'll tell?
I'd never tell.

178
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,893
You'd totally tell.

179
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:03,162
Not Mom and Dad.

180
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:04,465
Totally Mom and Dad.

181
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:06,966
Maybe.

182
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:09,368
Definitely, but you get points
for honesty.

183
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,239
So, tell me.

184
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:17,712
You don't know. Do you?

185
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,245
Just do your work, Lizzie.

186
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,249
- Hallie.
- Lizzie.

187
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:25,086
Fine.

188
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:32,423
I could stay home alone,
you know. I'm old enough.

189
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,395
Physical age, maybe.

190
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,149
Did you hear that?

191
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:02,222
Hey, Mom? Dad!

192
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hey, Mom?

193
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:09,794
Hallie, someone's in here.

194
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:12,366
Stay here. Okay? Don't move.

195
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

196
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:37,314
Hallie? Hallie,
what is it? Hallie...

197
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:46,058
We called the police!

198
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,467
Katie? Katie?

199
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,437
<i>Police emergency.
Can I help you?</i>

200
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,738
Katie.

201
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,313
Katie, you here?

202
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,602
Mr. Jensen?

203
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:31,339
Where's my daughter?

204
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:33,674
I don't know.

205
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:40,145
- Is Katie here? Are you hiding her?
- No.

206
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:41,314
I don't know where she is.

207
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,955
It's all your fault.

208
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:51,755
She was never
into this stuff.

209
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,325
- All this occult stuff.
- Hallie?

210
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:55,462
Lizzie, stay back.

211
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:59,132
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

212
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:02,801
- Where is she?
- No! Don't! Hallie!

213
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:04,136
- Where is my daughter?
- Hallie!

214
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:05,603
- Lizzie!
- Where is she?

215
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:08,939
Let's go.

216
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:13,311
- Stay the hell away from my family!
- Hey, hey, hey!

217
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,514
You hear me, Jensen?

218
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,991
Did you guys really try
and summon Slender Man?

219
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,552
Why?

220
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:55,654
We chickened out.

221
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:58,156
You chickened out.

222
00:20:58,158 --> 00:20:59,957
- I chickened out?
- You chickened out.

223
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:00,824
- I remember you being the one...
- He chickened out.

224
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,427
...that chickened out.

225
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,564
Katie's father broke into
my house last night.

226
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,199
- What?
- What?

227
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:10,535
He said something about Katie
being into the occult,

228
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,203
and then he blamed us
for getting her into it.

229
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,805
Wait, what did he mean about
Katie being into the occult?

230
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:16,408
I don't know.
He was so wasted.

231
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,846
This could be
the next wrinkle in the story.

232
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:22,680
I don't want
to play this game.

233
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:27,686
It's not a game.
Katie's missing.

234
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:30,021
Yeah, and we know things
that nobody else knows.

235
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,723
What do we know?

236
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,692
We know that
she watched that video.

237
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:38,196
Look, we all watched that video.
It didn't do anything.

238
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:40,119
When are we gonna admit
that Katie was kidnapped?

239
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,904
Somebody has her.

240
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:49,541
Yeah, but when we watched that
video, it affected all of us.

241
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,408
Something happened.
I felt it.

242
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,812
- I didn't see anything.
- I didn't see anything, either.

243
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:58,783
Didn't say I saw it.
I said I felt it.

244
00:21:58,785 --> 00:21:59,887
And I think you did, too.

245
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:03,921
And I'm damn sure
that Katie felt it,

246
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,660
and that's why
she disappeared!

247
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,342
This is a bad idea.

248
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,912
It's just a quick
look around, okay?

249
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:32,917
Plus, you know what, he's probably
totally passed out by now.

250
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:34,785
I don't know, I just feel like
there's got to be something.

251
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,522
- You know, like a clue, maybe, or...
- You're crazy.

252
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:40,492
You don't realize
how he was last night.

253
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:44,665
The back door is always unlocked
for when Katie gets home late.

254
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,367
Just saying.

255
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:53,341
Great. Then let's go.

256
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:23,270
Told ya.

257
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,718
Wren?

258
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,856
Hi. Hi, Mr. Jensen.

259
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,204
What are you doing here?

260
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:01,805
Well, I just wanted
to come down

261
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,612
and see if there was anything
that I could do, if I could help

262
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,914
in any way?

263
00:24:11,084 --> 00:24:14,121
Anything I could do.

264
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,223
I miss her.

265
00:24:19,093 --> 00:24:21,362
People just don't disappear.

266
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,298
You want to come in?

267
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,270
That'd be great.

268
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,425
She's really gone.

269
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:57,263
The police must have
taken her laptop.

270
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,942
What is all this?

271
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:35,468
She used to keep
cigarettes and stuff in here.

272
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:02,830
Let's just take it.

273
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,982
Okay. Here's the last
site she visited.

274
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:27,552
What am I looking at?

275
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:28,555
Here, click it.

276
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,356
Okay.

277
00:26:52,245 --> 00:26:56,347
Oh, shit.

278
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:00,283
All these, like, town names,
and dates and stuff.

279
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,287
Click another one.

280
00:27:03,223 --> 00:27:06,390
<i>Okay, guys. Let's go.</i>

281
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,860
<i>I am Slender Man.</i>

282
00:27:08,862 --> 00:27:12,097
<i>- Dude.
- Guys, guys.</i>

283
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:14,234
<i>Whoa, whoa.
What is that? What is that?</i>

284
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,700
<i>I'm so scared. I'm so...</i>

285
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,273
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

286
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,775
<i>- Oh, God!
- Dude, he's there!</i>

287
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:25,879
<i>I can't...</i>

288
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:30,651
- It's him.
- I don't like this.

289
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,121
- Wait, look.
- What?

290
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,324
AleeyKat93.

291
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,559
Jeez.

292
00:27:41,561 --> 00:27:43,964
They went back and forth,
like, a gazillion times.

293
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:48,669
"I knew he was there
before I saw him."

294
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:52,506
It's like they're
comparing experiences.

295
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:57,876
Wait, look.
Katie posted a video.

296
00:27:57,878 --> 00:28:00,514
Look, it's from the
night before she disappeared.

297
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:31,679
- What was that?
- What did you see?

298
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:36,781
What did you see?

299
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:40,721
- I don't know, I...
- I don't know, either.

300
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,993
- I talked to her.
- Who?

301
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:31,596
AleeyKat93.

302
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:33,931
It was that girl that Katie was
talking to on that website.

303
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:36,700
I messaged her,
and she replied.

304
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,468
You went back
on that website?

305
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:42,474
She told me everything. He gets
in your head like a virus.

306
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:44,074
What kind of virus?

307
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:45,810
Like a computer virus
that infects your hard drive,

308
00:30:45,812 --> 00:30:47,744
but instead of your
hard drive, it's your brain.

309
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,446
- Wren, you're gonna need to slow down...
- No, listen to me.

310
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:53,485
Once the virus takes hold,
he's got you. It's done.

311
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:56,987
Some he haunts,
some he drives mad.

312
00:30:56,989 --> 00:31:00,493
- And others, he takes, like...
- Like what?

313
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,095
Katie.

314
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:07,266
Listen, I know that this...

315
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:10,534
This is gonna sound crazy,

316
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:14,772
but AleeyKat said we can

317
00:31:14,774 --> 00:31:17,742
"unveil ourselves."

318
00:31:17,744 --> 00:31:19,510
Okay, if we just surrender
something to him

319
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:22,746
that has personal meaning,
something that we truly love.

320
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:23,908
What the hell does that mean?

321
00:31:25,785 --> 00:31:27,383
We can contact Slender Man.

322
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,654
Why would we do that?

323
00:31:29,656 --> 00:31:32,756
To get Katie back. Hello?

324
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,292
Katie did it, and the next
day, she was just gone.

325
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,529
Okay, Katie asked Slender Man

326
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:39,597
- to take her?
- Yes.

327
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,699
Why would she do that?

328
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:45,569
I don't know. You know, maybe
she had an alcoholic father,

329
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:48,673
and maybe she hated her life,
and maybe she talked about

330
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:50,410
running away all the time,
you know?

331
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:55,780
Guys, the police have
no leads.

332
00:31:55,782 --> 00:31:58,683
Right? Right?

333
00:31:58,685 --> 00:32:04,120
So, even if the odds
are a million-to-one

334
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,890
that any of this is real,
or that...

335
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:10,661
That he has anything to do
with Katie's disappearance,

336
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:13,266
we owe it to her to try.

337
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:23,002
This should work.

338
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,176
I guess that I'll...

339
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,180
Go first, then.

340
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:40,821
I...

341
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:45,589
I made this in pottery class,
when I was five.

342
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,958
This is a picture of me
and my dad.

343
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,261
It's the only one I have
where we're together.

344
00:33:50,263 --> 00:33:53,296
It was taken a few months
before he died.

345
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:56,168
My grandma made this
when Lizzie was born.

346
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,735
She died eight years ago.

347
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:14,018
Surprised you didn't bring one
of your trophies, or medals.

348
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,857
You said it had to be
something I cared about, so...

349
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,263
I brought this.

350
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,709
Lights out.

351
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,888
Okay, so...

352
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,857
Listen, once we ask
for Katie's return,

353
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:58,328
we have to keep these
blindfolds on, all right?

354
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,232
AleeyKat said not to look
in his face.

355
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:02,268
If you do,

356
00:35:03,236 --> 00:35:05,703
you're messed up forever.

357
00:35:05,705 --> 00:35:10,410
It's different for everyone, but it
only ends in insanity, or death.

358
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,783
Okay.

359
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:39,235
Okay, hold my hand, hold my hand.
You hold her hand, too, okay?

360
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,274
We all have to hold hands.

361
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:46,710
How long do you think
we're gonna give this?

362
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:49,949
As long as it takes.

363
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,560
Keep your blindfolds on.

364
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:16,741
Do you hear that?

365
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:27,583
Guys, we shouldn't be
doing this.

366
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,587
- She's right.
- It's too late.

367
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:01,051
- Chloe! Chloe!
- Chloe, come back!

368
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,853
- Come on! Chloe!
- Come back, Chloe!

369
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

370
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:31,951
Chloe?

371
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:39,525
Hallie!

372
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

373
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,614
Oh, my God! Hallie.

374
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:05,216
- Where's Chloe?
- I don't know!

375
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:07,518
I told her to keep
her freaking blindfold on.

376
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,456
- She...
- Chloe!

377
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Oh, my God, Chloe!
- Chloe!

378
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:39,451
Jesus, Chloe, you scared us
to death! Where did you go?

379
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,622
I lost my shoe.

380
00:38:44,424 --> 00:38:45,424
It's okay.

381
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,125
What happened?

382
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:52,362
- You saw him.
- Wren.

383
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,697
Chloe, I told you not to
take your blindfold off.

384
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:58,101
- Did you see him?
- Nothing happened.

385
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:01,605
I just got scared. Okay?

386
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:05,007
Something happened, and she knows it.
Something happened back there!

387
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:09,779
You're right. We didn't get Katie back.
That's what happened.

388
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,785
Come on.

389
00:39:16,656 --> 00:39:18,091
Wait, guys.
Wait for me.

390
00:39:58,598 --> 00:39:59,598
Hal?

391
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:01,466
Go away.

392
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:06,373
Are you okay?

393
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:10,308
I'm fine!

394
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,913
I'm fine! Just...
I'll see you later, okay?

395
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:18,818
Just go to sleep.
We'll hang tomorrow, okay?

396
00:43:58,536 --> 00:44:00,337
Hey.

397
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:02,641
What's up with Chloe?
It's been a few days.

398
00:44:07,346 --> 00:44:10,984
She's fine. Just a cold.

399
00:44:30,636 --> 00:44:33,640
Hey, Hallie! Wait up.

400
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,141
- Hey.
- Hey.

401
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:41,546
How you holding up? I mean,
with Katie and everything.

402
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:44,248
Um...

403
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:48,085
Well, I'm okay. I...

404
00:44:48,087 --> 00:44:50,920
Hey, tomorrow's Friday.

405
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:53,089
We got the weekend coming up.

406
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:56,928
I was thinking,
maybe we should do something.

407
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:02,833
Yeah, sure.

408
00:45:02,835 --> 00:45:06,773
You want to come over tomorrow night?
To my place?

409
00:45:15,348 --> 00:45:16,482
Hallie.

410
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:21,153
Hallie?

411
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,391
- What?
- Are you okay?

412
00:45:30,629 --> 00:45:33,131
Yeah, that's cool.
Your place?

413
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:34,765
Sure.

414
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:38,638
I'll see you later?

415
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:40,672
Okay.

416
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

417
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:11,181
Hallie. Hallie, can you...
Can you hear me? I...

418
00:49:34,306 --> 00:49:35,507
Hello?

419
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

420
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:29,458
Oh, God.

421
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Please! Please help!

422
00:51:22,681 --> 00:51:25,051
No! No, no!

423
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:28,386
No!

424
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:31,122
Please!

425
00:51:33,158 --> 00:51:35,194
No, no!

426
00:52:14,065 --> 00:52:16,106
Miss, are you all right?

427
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:20,271
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.

428
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:34,587
I'm sorry.

429
00:52:35,587 --> 00:52:37,790
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

430
00:52:46,098 --> 00:52:48,130
Hey. Are you not getting
my texts, or something?

431
00:52:48,132 --> 00:52:49,898
- Look, Wren, I don't...
- No, no, no.

432
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,603
Look at me. I found proof.
I found the proof. Right?

433
00:52:52,605 --> 00:52:54,304
Look, look, look,
I understand.

434
00:52:54,306 --> 00:52:55,904
I understand now, what AleeyKat
was trying to tell me.

435
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:58,107
It's proof. Read this.
Read this with me.

436
00:52:58,109 --> 00:53:01,011
Okay, it says, "paranormal
contact with bioelectric systems

437
00:53:01,013 --> 00:53:04,013
"often results
in a symbiotic relationship.

438
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:08,018
"The effects on host organisms have
been well documented and manifest

439
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,654
"in various forms, such as..."

440
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:13,790
- Wren. Wren. Calm down.
- No, no, no.

441
00:53:13,792 --> 00:53:17,125
Shh. Listen to me. "Personality
change, bizarre behavior,

442
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,998
"mental illness, psychosis,
loss of contact with reality,

443
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,601
"self-mutilation, and suicide.

444
00:53:24,603 --> 00:53:28,804
"And nonspecific dissolution."

445
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:30,975
They just disappear.

446
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:35,478
Has...

447
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,683
Has anything weird happened to
you lately, or strange, or...

448
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,488
Do not hold out on me.

449
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:48,759
- Okay, so, I was talking with Tom...
- Tom?

450
00:53:48,761 --> 00:53:52,429
- What's wrong with Tom?
- What? Who gives a shit about Tom, Hal?

451
00:53:52,431 --> 00:53:53,929
- Just tell me what happened.
- Okay.

452
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:56,868
I thought I saw something
in the trees.

453
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:00,804
It was him.

454
00:54:00,806 --> 00:54:03,572
And, what about Chloe?
Have you talked to her?

455
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:06,842
I don't know. I've called her house, and
her mom keeps telling me she's sick.

456
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:10,882
Last time I called, she pretty much
flat out told me to stay away.

457
00:54:13,152 --> 00:54:15,484
We need to go there right now.

458
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:17,219
Wren, there's nothing
we can do, and I have track.

459
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:19,658
- I can't just leave.
- Track?

460
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,697
I thought you didn't care
about track anymore.

461
00:54:26,031 --> 00:54:27,533
I thought you cared
about Chloe.

462
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

463
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:19,550
Chloe.

464
00:55:30,562 --> 00:55:32,931
Chloe. Wake up.

465
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,002
What the hell
was that?

466
00:55:39,004 --> 00:55:40,603
I don't know, but I told...

467
00:55:40,605 --> 00:55:42,471
I knew that she saw his face
in the woods, you know?

468
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:44,806
I knew that she was
lying, too. I knew that.

469
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:46,711
I don't want to
do this anymore.

470
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:51,413
Yeah, I don't, either.

471
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:53,917
But I'm stuck in it.

472
00:55:53,919 --> 00:55:56,522
And you are, too.
You just don't realize it yet.

473
00:55:59,324 --> 00:56:02,324
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not doing a "thing."

474
00:56:02,326 --> 00:56:03,495
All right.

475
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:09,000
"All right"?
Yeah, don't say "All right."

476
00:56:10,301 --> 00:56:13,638
We only watched
the website video.

477
00:56:14,973 --> 00:56:19,208
But Chloe,
she saw him in the woods.

478
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:22,744
- Wren, I can't keep...
- Read the book that I showed you.

479
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:27,417
You will see the body count, okay?
Thousands of disappearances.

480
00:56:27,419 --> 00:56:32,288
Search parties, faces on milk cartons.
I'm not making this shit up.

481
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:36,125
And it all happened
exactly like AleeyKat said.

482
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:38,527
It's probably some 50-year-old dude
living in his parents' basement,

483
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:41,063
getting off on e-mailing
teenage girls every day.

484
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,400
Did you ever think of that?
Did you?

485
00:56:43,402 --> 00:56:46,368
So, you think that you can
just go back to real life?

486
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:49,337
Yeah, I do. In fact,
I have a real-life date

487
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:53,842
with real-life Tom tonight.
In real life.

488
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:56,011
He's not gonna stop!

489
00:56:56,013 --> 00:56:58,647
And going on a date
with fucking Abercrombie Tom

490
00:56:58,649 --> 00:57:00,449
is not gonna change anything!

491
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:03,087
You know I'm right!

492
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:09,361
You know I'm right.

493
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,303
- Hey.
- Hey.

494
00:58:25,437 --> 00:58:26,735
Sorry I'm late.

495
00:58:26,737 --> 00:58:29,772
- No worries. Come on in.
- Thanks.

496
00:58:29,774 --> 00:58:31,406
I thought I had
the wrong house

497
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:34,310
because there weren't any cars
in the driveway.

498
00:58:34,312 --> 00:58:38,516
Yeah, my dad's at this business thing,
and Mom's at her book club, so...

499
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,985
So, nobody's home?

500
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:45,991
No, it's just us.
Is that okay?

501
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:49,495
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

502
00:58:59,638 --> 00:59:01,840
I didn't know you were
such a music geek.

503
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,172
Hmm.

504
00:59:09,147 --> 00:59:14,253
So, this is my dad's,
but I like it.

505
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:16,388
Cool.

506
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,960
Do you want me to put
something else on, or...

507
00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:29,167
- No. This is great.
- Okay. Cool.

508
01:00:03,134 --> 01:00:04,900
- What?
- Do you hear that?

509
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:07,004
Yeah. It's good, right?

510
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Hey.
Hey, come here.

511
01:00:31,696 --> 01:00:32,730
What the hell?

512
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:36,364
Hallie, I didn't do anything.

513
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:39,403
I know. Oh, God.

514
01:00:40,672 --> 01:00:42,407
Are you okay?

515
01:00:45,743 --> 01:00:47,578
Here.

516
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,185
Have you told
anyone else about this?

517
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,833
If Katie was on some weird
Slender Man website, then

518
01:01:10,969 --> 01:01:13,304
who knows who she met?
I mean...

519
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,508
Probably some weird guy
in a van, you know?

520
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:20,978
I hate to say it.

521
01:01:42,734 --> 01:01:44,600
Is this it?

522
01:01:44,602 --> 01:01:46,770
- No, don't.
- Come on.

523
01:01:46,772 --> 01:01:50,138
Tom, please.
You can't go on that site.

524
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,641
- It's just a video.
- It's not just a video.

525
01:01:52,643 --> 01:01:55,277
Promise me you won't
ever watch that video.

526
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:59,147
Tom, I'm serious.
Please promise.

527
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:02,553
Okay. Okay, I promise.

528
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:08,359
Really.

529
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:19,670
I need to go.

530
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:08,817
All right, first, let's all
take a moment to observe...

531
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:12,821
- Tom. Hey.
- ...the exterior anatomy here.

532
01:03:12,823 --> 01:03:15,794
Tom? Tom.

533
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:21,899
Hey. Are you okay?

534
01:03:30,074 --> 01:03:34,476
Now, you'll notice that the cornea
looks a little cloudy and bluish.

535
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:38,848
That happens naturally because
of the preservation process.

536
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:41,183
So, very carefully,
with your scalpels,

537
01:03:41,185 --> 01:03:44,252
I want you to make a slice right through
the sclera as evenly as you can.

538
01:03:44,254 --> 01:03:48,559
That's gonna separate the
anterior features of the eye.

539
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,931
Hallie.

540
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:10,074

- Hallie.

541
01:05:24,689 --> 01:05:25,924

542
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:29,861

543
01:05:35,533 --> 01:05:36,534
Hallie!

544
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:50,915
- Help me, Hallie.
- Katie?

545
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:10,635
Katie?

546
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:15,373
Hallie.

547
01:06:16,408 --> 01:06:17,906
Katie!

548
01:06:17,908 --> 01:06:20,074
Katie, come back!

549
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,743
Katie!

550
01:06:21,745 --> 01:06:23,511
Katie!

551
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:24,882

552
01:06:25,683 --> 01:06:27,152

553
01:06:28,919 --> 01:06:30,587

554
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:35,259
Katie!

555
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,028
Hallie, help me.

557
01:08:19,063 --> 01:08:20,495
Come on, breathe.

558
01:08:20,497 --> 01:08:22,496
You're gonna be okay.

559
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:24,365
- Breathe...
- How long did they say?

560
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,035
- I don't know. Come on. Come on.
- It's gonna be okay.

561
01:08:26,037 --> 01:08:28,070
- Just breathe, sweetheart.
- Breathe, breathe.

562
01:08:28,072 --> 01:08:30,239
Come on. We got you.
We got you. Stay up.

563
01:08:30,241 --> 01:08:32,139
That's right, deep breath.

564
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:33,709
- Just breathe. Deep breaths.
- Lizzie, what's going on?

565
01:08:33,711 --> 01:08:35,378
Oh, my God. Lizzie!

566
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:36,745
- The ambulance is on its way.
- Lizzie.

567
01:08:36,747 --> 01:08:38,379
Lizzie, it's okay.
Just look at me.

568
01:08:38,381 --> 01:08:41,083
- We got you.
- It's okay, baby, it's okay.

569
01:08:41,085 --> 01:08:43,752
Okay, the ambulance
is on its way, honey.

570
01:08:43,754 --> 01:08:45,420
No. No, Lizzie!

571
01:08:45,422 --> 01:08:47,589
- Lizzie, wake up! Lizzie!
- We're all here, Lizzie.

572
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:49,223
- Dad, do something!
- Where is that ambulance?

573
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,360
- I'm doing my best. Come on, Lizzie!
- Lizzie, wake up!

574
01:08:51,362 --> 01:08:53,797
- Come on, Lizzie, just breathe.
- Lizzie, wake up!

575
01:09:14,117 --> 01:09:16,884
Blood tests are negative.
She's gonna be fine.

576
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,788
They think it was just
some kind of panic attack.

577
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:23,894
They want to keep her to monitor
her for at least another day.

578
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:53,208
No. No.

579
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:55,613

Hey. She's okay.
She's okay.

I know you're in there!

You're sorry? That's it? That's my sister!
Why would you do that?

615

She came to me.

616
01:18:35,746 --> 01:18:38,114
- Wren, she's in the hospital!
- She came to me.

617

It was before I knew.

To get Lizzie back,

619
01:18:49,865 --> 01:18:53,368
you can't just
give him something you love.

620
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:57,139
It's not enough.

621
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:00,409
