1
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,908
You got to help me look for a new place.

2
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:10,886
My nosy neighbors are getting worse.

3
00:01:10,927 --> 00:01:12,835
They are saying I come home late
because I'm a hooker.

4
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:14,126
<i>Does that bother you?</i>

5
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,334
Nope. But I'm not a hooker.

6
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,522
<i>Maybe it's easier being a hooker.</i>

7
00:01:18,563 --> 00:01:19,755
You sleep with them then they pay you.

8
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:22,013
Wouldn't be that easy.
You have to put make-up on every night.

9
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:24,459
And your client may be rough or too big.

10
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,667
You have to know how to pick them.

11
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:26,716
<i>And how would you do that?</i>

12
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:29,583
How would I know if a client
is rough or too big beforehand?

13
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:31,760
I'd check before
I'd agree to sleep with them.

14
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,417
If his dick was limp, how would you know
it would be too big?

15
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,466
<i>I would know.</i>

16
00:01:35,507 --> 00:01:37,850
You wouldn't
because you're a clueless virgin.

17
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:39,504
Hang on, a car is coming.

18
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:44,865
You didn't put me on speaker?

19
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:45,917
If the boss finds out,
you'll be in trouble.

20
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,107
Done.

21
00:01:47,384 --> 00:01:48,683
<i>Aren't you using up all your phone data?</i>

22
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:50,084
I don't care.
Tonight's so quiet, it's creepy.

23
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,251
Who's on your shift with you?

24
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:55,822
Mr. Chondro was here. But he left
for the office. I don't know why.

25
00:01:56,223 --> 00:01:59,167
They're closing this toll booth soon.
Not many cars come through this gate.

26
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,709
Soon no one will be assigned
to any gate.

27
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,375
It's ridiculous that they are replacing
everybody with machines.

28
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,750
Nobody will have a job.

29
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:09,217
That's why we need to start
our clothing store soon.

30
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:12,917
I won't miss this. I won't have to deal
with so many weird people.

31
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:16,210
Like the guy in the old sedan
that has been stalking me for weeks.

32
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:21,084
I told you. Maybe he's just coming home
from work every day.

33
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,834
Dini, he drove by here twice
or three times in one night.

34
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:24,831
Isn't that strange?

35
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:27,251
And he looks at me as if
he's going to eat me alive.

36
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:29,761
What are you, a newbie?
I already told you.

37
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:31,593
<i>Don't ever look the drivers
in their eyes.</i>

38
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:32,690
<i>Just look at their hands.</i>

39
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:36,331
His hands were gross.
Dirty fingernails and all.

40
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:37,417
Maybe he's a gravedigger.

41
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,121
You're not helping. It's easy for you,
you're not alone there.

42
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:41,239
Who is stationed there with you?

43
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,841
I got that dude Wahyu.
He's always looking my way.

44
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:48,417
He's been driving me home
these past three days.

45
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,168
Is Wahyu really into second-hand items?

46
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,542
<i>Can't you listen to other songs?</i>

47
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,417
It's so last century it sounds creepy.

48
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,384
No. My radio's stuck in AM.
The FM mode is not working.

49
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:02,208
Shit.

50
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,334
<i>What's wrong?</i>

51
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,165
That creepy car is here again.

52
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,618
<i>Hello?</i>

53
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:14,382
<i>Maya?</i>

54
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,509
<i>Hello?</i>

55
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:26,917
<i>Maya?</i>

56
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:27,875
He's still here.

57
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,334
<i>Oh, no. What is he doing?</i>

58
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,751
He's staring at me.

59
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:31,970
<i>I'm calling the office.</i>

60
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,074
He's finally gone. Thank you, Sir!

61
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:49,368
Shit, my heart almost stopped.

62
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:57,921
Din! It's still here!

63
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,978
He's walking towards my post!
What should I do?

64
00:04:02,477 --> 00:04:03,798
Din!

65
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:06,843
<i>Stay calm. I'm calling the office.</i>

66
00:04:06,884 --> 00:04:09,708
<i>Can someone come
to Bukit Selatan 1 gate now?</i>

67
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,165
<i>Someone is harassing an officer.
Now, please!</i>

68
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:13,334
<i>Okay, okay. Just stay calm.</i>

69
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,118
<i>Lock the door! Close the window!</i>

70
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:23,834
<i>Find something near you!</i>

71
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,210
What do you mean?

72
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:28,084
<i>A metal stick, a rock,
anything you can use as a weapon?</i>

73
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,329
There's nothing here. I'm so dead!

74
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:53,858
Security guards are coming!

75
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:56,281
Are you Rahayu?

76
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:59,525
No, my name's Maya. Can't you read?

77
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,705
- Is that your real name?
- Yes.

78
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:06,579
<i>Hey! Don't mess with her! Go away!</i>

79
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:21,209
Are you from Harjosari Village
in Mandiraja?

80
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,916
What do you want?

81
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:28,972
Is your father's name Ki Donowongso?

82
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:43,025
<i>Maya!</i>

83
00:05:45,454 --> 00:05:48,001
He's going away. He's going.

84
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,829
If help doesn't come in a minute,
just get out of there. Leave the booth!

85
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:55,837
<i>Is anyone coming
to the Bukit Selatan 1 booth?</i>

86
00:05:58,001 --> 00:06:00,634
Dini, he's coming back with a weapon!

87
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:02,392
<i>What weapon?</i>

88
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:07,142
<i>Maya!</i>

89
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:12,548
<i>Maya!</i>

90
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:16,173
Maya!

91
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,392
Help!

92
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:57,684
Hey!

93
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,603
Drop your weapon!

94
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:03,134
We...

95
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:10,782
We just don't want
what your family left behind.

96
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,689
Please take it away.

97
00:09:10,493 --> 00:09:12,125
Hey, you wanna check my new collection?

98
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,390
Not now.

99
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:15,667
Pay for the shirt
you bought last week then.

100
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:16,960
I can't pay you right now.

101
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:19,470
But you got lots of customers!

102
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:22,469
Exactly. I'm busy now.

103
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:26,302
Come on. Just get your purse
and give me my money.

104
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:36,146
You need a new bra?

105
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:51,717
We should've checked first...

106
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,964
...whether this market
was good for business.

107
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:53,751
Relax.

108
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,125
We got duped because the rent is cheap.

109
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,870
We'll sell these online.

110
00:09:57,911 --> 00:09:59,370
These crappy fakes?

111
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:02,558
That's why we'll sell them online.

112
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,694
Even I wouldn't wear one of these.

113
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:06,591
I'd rather wear a plastic bag
or a rice sack.

114
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,159
Sorry I dragged you into this.
We used up all your money.

115
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,583
It's not like you put a gun to my head.
I wanted to join this business.

116
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,619
I'm going away for a week or so.

117
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,951
Where to?

118
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,552
Where to?

119
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:31,490
Who are they?

120
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:35,378
After the attack,
I dug into my late aunt's stuff.

121
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:36,686
I found this photo.

122
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:38,667
I think they're my parents.

123
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,083
You "think"?

124
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:42,459
I never saw photos of them before.

125
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,818
And I was too young
to really remember them.

126
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,646
Rahayu?

127
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,567
So the psycho dude was right?

128
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,964
I do remember my aunt
called me Rahayu when I was young.

129
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:57,666
Then she started calling me Maya.
I don't know why.

130
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:58,646
So what?

131
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,708
Look at the photo again.
What do you notice?

132
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:04,990
You were really short
for a five-year-old?

133
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:07,964
The house?

134
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:10,070
The big house.

135
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:13,083
It's the key to solving our problems.
My family's house.

136
00:11:14,163 --> 00:11:16,954
But you don't even know where it is.

137
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:22,802
The psycho mentioned
the name of the village.

138
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:26,490
Harjosari, Mandiraja. I looked it up.

139
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:34,021
This could be our chance
to start a new life.

140
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,666
I'm going with you.

141
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:37,973
No.

142
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:43,984
You are my best friend.
No way I let you go alone.

143
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:47,487
And if you turn out to be rich,
you can't leave me behind.

144
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:49,721
What about our kiosk?

145
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:51,388
Nobody comes to buy our stuff anyway.

146
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,377
Hey! You can't smoke in there!

147
00:11:54,418 --> 00:11:57,023
You can't be in here, pervert!
This is the ladies room.

148
00:11:57,064 --> 00:12:00,630
Shut up! Get the hell out of here!

149
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,122
What happened?

150
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:06,199
It's the wound.

151
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,667
How come it still looks fresh?

152
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:09,847
I don't know.
I just need some disinfectant.

153
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:12,867
Because I know it's not that time
of the month for you.

154
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:14,950
Stay here.
I'll get you some disinfectant.

155
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:43,293
Dini?

156
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:03,122
Dini?

157
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:14,059
Dini?

158
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,749
You haven't gone home?

159
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,444
We will soon.

160
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,757
Dini?

161
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,044
Dini?

162
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

163
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:47,439
Dini?

164
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,501
People are getting lazier these days.

165
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,880
They turn the lights off early
and lock the doors.

166
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,874
The pharmacy is closed.

167
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:04,700
No medicine for you, then.

168
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:23,771
HAVE A PLEASANT TRIP

169
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:32,688
What are you reading?

170
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:34,395
Business planning.

171
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,159
What business?

172
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,013
Any business. So I know my way around
if we're to start another.

173
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,898
Besides, if I don't read,
I'll just go to the toilet all the time.

174
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:47,840
Turn off your light.
The guy behind us is annoyed.

175
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,083
Goddamn hillbilly.

176
00:15:55,544 --> 00:15:57,476
How long until we get there?

177
00:15:57,517 --> 00:15:59,849
The driver said six hours.

178
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:06,232
See, now I have to pee.

179
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,000
Use this, Love.

180
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,125
You're not going to need it?

181
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,917
It's okay. I'm not cold. Go to sleep.

182
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,568
I'll wake you up
when we reach your parents' village.

183
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,666
I wasn't bothered by you or your friend.

184
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:29,791
I cough sometimes so the spirits
on this bus won't bother the passengers.

185
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,521
Spirits?

186
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:35,756
There are spirits on this bus.

187
00:17:35,797 --> 00:17:39,388
They don't know where to go.

188
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:46,083
Don't think I'm weird.

189
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:48,437
I am a university lecturer.

190
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:50,973
A lecturer? What do you teach?

191
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:53,154
Russian literature.

192
00:17:58,302 --> 00:18:00,655
I know
it's not much use in this country.

193
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:03,482
But I love Russian.

194
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,208
Well, I love all languages.

195
00:18:07,372 --> 00:18:10,026
You know Javanese?

196
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:16,150
Why would I study foreign languages
if I don't know my own?

197
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:22,591
Do you know what this says?

198
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:32,138
This is very ancient Javanese.

199
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:38,708
It's a spell so that the carrier
won't be bothered by evil spirits.

200
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:40,550
So this is like an amulet?

201
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:44,700
Yes. But this was made
by an evil person.

202
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,146
Where did you get this picture?

203
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:49,935
From the internet.

204
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,208
What's on your mind?

205
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:18,122
Nothing.

206
00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:21,853
You're thinking about your parents?

207
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,426
Do you know anything about them at all?

208
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:31,679
No. My aunt raised me.
And she wasn't much of a talker.

209
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,825
If I asked her about my parents,
she wouldn't say much.

210
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:38,750
Parents are overrated.

211
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,625
I've known my parents all my life.

212
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,866
It didn't do me any good.
Didn't make me happier.

213
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:48,349
But at least you know them.

214
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:53,310
That's true. Especially if your parents
may have left you with a fortune.

215
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,521
But we really have to be careful.

216
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,959
That's why we're going there
just to check things out.

217
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,123
If I do have some sort
of inheritance there,...

218
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:03,464
...we'll come back with a lawyer.

219
00:20:03,505 --> 00:20:05,536
Lawyer? How fancy.

220
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,628
Thank you for coming with me.

221
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:21,166
Don't mention it.

222
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:24,654
Just pray we won't have to stay
in a place with roaches.

223
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:30,500
- Holy shit!
- What's wrong?

224
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,814
I swear I saw
those three little girls...

225
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,125
...standing by the side
of the road earlier.

226
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,833
It's 1 a.m. All children are sleeping.

227
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:38,790
I swear to God!

228
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:44,072
How long did you say
before we get there?

229
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,483
Five hours.

230
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:11,875
Have you heard of Harjosari?

231
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,833
Harjosari? Never heard of it, Miss.

232
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,480
Where did you look the place up? Google?

233
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:20,917
I tried but couldn't find it.

234
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,292
So I called the Provincial government.
It's there under their territory.

235
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,620
Well nobody ever heard of it.

236
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,083
We've only asked one person.

237
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:36,558
Have you heard of Harjosari Village?

238
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,667
Yes.

239
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,089
Can you take us there?

240
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,074
No.

241
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:41,105
Why?

242
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:42,312
It's too far.

243
00:21:42,353 --> 00:21:44,076
How much?

244
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:45,630
A hundred thousand Rupiah.

245
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:49,122
Okay.

246
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:52,021
For each of you.

247
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,365
Where are you from?
"Bloodsuckers Village"?

248
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,273
No, I'm from "Handsome
and Rich Village".

249
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,449
Wait until my horse finishes his lunch.

250
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,929
When did you last feed him?
Last month?

251
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,178
Last year.

252
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,869
Why do you want to go to Harjosari?

253
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:16,786
We're university students
and we're doing research.

254
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:20,349
In Harjosari?
Research on what?

255
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:22,272
Why are you laughing?

256
00:22:22,313 --> 00:22:25,250
There's nothing in Harjosari.
It's a secluded village.

257
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:28,208
That's right. We're doing research
on secluded villages.

258
00:22:28,593 --> 00:22:29,810
I see.

259
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:35,292
What do you know about the village?

260
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,333
Not much.

261
00:22:37,374 --> 00:22:38,605
I know about the village...

262
00:22:38,646 --> 00:22:40,709
...because I recently took
their village elder home.

263
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,959
The village elder is a puppet master.
He was in my town for a performance.

264
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,209
What's his name?

265
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,958
Ki Saptadi.

266
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,206
He's quite well-known.

267
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:51,875
Why don't they build
a proper road to the village?

268
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:54,416
I heard they didn't want to.

269
00:22:54,728 --> 00:22:55,729
Why?

270
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,395
I don't know.

271
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,375
Dini, please take off those sunglasses.

272
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,378
But it's so sunny. I'm dizzy.

273
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:06,752
What's your plan?

274
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:09,331
Miss, where do you want me
to drop you off?

275
00:23:09,372 --> 00:23:11,417
Just drop us off at Ki Saptadi's,
the village elder's house.

276
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:13,459
- Okay.
- Are you sure?

277
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,291
Well, I don't think
we can find a hotel here.

278
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:40,792
Are we staying the night
in this village?

279
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:41,709
I don't know.

280
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,834
What do you mean you don't know?

281
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,876
Depends on the situation.

282
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:47,167
We don't even know
if my house still exists.

283
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:51,193
I didn't ask you to come with me.
Don't be fussy.

284
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,700
Holy shit, it's huge.

285
00:23:58,161 --> 00:23:59,589
Do you know whose house that is?

286
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,284
I don't know.

287
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:04,014
I asked Ki Saptadi
when we passed the house,...

288
00:24:04,055 --> 00:24:06,209
...but he didn't say anything.

289
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,911
What a waste, right?
A house that big sitting empty.

290
00:24:37,931 --> 00:24:39,514
Do you want me to wait for you?

291
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:41,247
No, but thanks a lot.

292
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,594
Here's my business card just in case.

293
00:24:47,635 --> 00:24:49,130
Thank you.

294
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:54,200
Thank you.

295
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,357
Let's go, Gorgeous.

296
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,250
We need to come up with a new story.

297
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,959
We can't say
that we're university students.

298
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,084
Why not?

299
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,858
What should we say
if he starts to ask about our research?

300
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:13,666
I don't know anything about it. Do you?

301
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:19,000
Just don't say that we're students.

302
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:19,792
What then?

303
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:20,593
Let me think.

304
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:22,146
Who are you looking for?

305
00:25:23,384 --> 00:25:25,634
We are university students, Ma'am.
We are hoping to see Ki Saptadi.

306
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:29,900
What for?

307
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:33,755
We are writing a book on puppet masters.

308
00:25:33,796 --> 00:25:36,708
We heard Ki Saptadi
is a famous puppet master.

309
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:44,083
He isn't home.
He'll be back in the evening.

310
00:25:44,124 --> 00:25:46,749
You can come back here tomorrow morning.

311
00:25:47,143 --> 00:25:49,240
Ok, we'll come back tomorrow.

312
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:54,494
Should we call the horse driver
to take us back?

313
00:25:54,535 --> 00:25:59,216
And return here tomorrow?
What a hassle.

314
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:18,417
There's a pathway.
I think someone must come here often.

315
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:23,271
We'll have to make a huge sign
saying, "Do Not Enter!"

316
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:26,216
It's huge.

317
00:26:26,257 --> 00:26:27,927
Yes, it's really huge.

318
00:27:02,841 --> 00:27:04,880
How long has it been
since the house was abandoned?

319
00:27:05,052 --> 00:27:06,626
Not sure.

320
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,458
How old were you
when you moved to the city?

321
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,263
According to my aunt,
when I was five years old.

322
00:27:12,304 --> 00:27:14,220
And you're 25 now?

323
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,982
So this house has been empty
for 20 years.

324
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:37,896
Who is that?

325
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,536
I don't know. I'm new here.

326
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:54,070
It seems that this house
was abandoned in a hurry.

327
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,583
What do you mean?

328
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:58,212
All the furniture is still here.

329
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:51,935
Yeah. This still works.

330
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,971
Where are you going?

331
00:28:58,012 --> 00:29:01,443
To check the most important place
in a house.

332
00:29:21,724 --> 00:29:24,693
We'll have to do
lots of pumping tonight.

333
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:29,498
This is crazy, Maya!

334
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:35,128
This house and the land
may be as big as 900 square meters!

335
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:37,272
Imagine how much money you'd get
if you sell it.

336
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:39,216
What are you doing?

337
00:30:40,414 --> 00:30:42,802
I found it in the drawer,
still wrapped in a plastic bag.

338
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:45,392
Does your aunt keep
any of your parents' documents?

339
00:30:45,872 --> 00:30:48,372
Not that I know of.

340
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:53,003
I bet your dad also owned
properties in other places.

341
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:55,355
We have to reclaim that property too.

342
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:57,869
My God. You may be stinking rich!

343
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,493
Don't you forget about me, okay?

344
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:06,880
They made a cute couple.

345
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,771
Are you sad?

346
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,457
No, I'm just puzzled.

347
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:17,541
Puzzled? Why?

348
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:20,417
I'm not in any of these photos.

349
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,904
I'm only in the photo
that I've shown you.

350
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,625
Maybe they didn't get the chance
to take your photo.

351
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:28,779
There are piles of pictures here.
None of me.

352
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:32,833
Maybe you were an ugly kid?

353
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:38,435
Don't think about it.

354
00:31:39,685 --> 00:31:42,991
Maybe they just preferred to kiss you
rather than to take photos of you.

355
00:31:43,032 --> 00:31:44,219
Isn't that better?

356
00:32:02,078 --> 00:32:04,638
I think someone just died
and was buried.

357
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:10,417
Are you sure your parents
were buried here?

358
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:12,041
Where else would they be?

359
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,043
But you said you think
your folks left in a hurry.

360
00:32:15,084 --> 00:32:17,138
You meant they had to leave
the village right?

361
00:32:18,357 --> 00:32:20,195
You might be right.

362
00:32:20,236 --> 00:32:23,500
Let's just finish this row
then we go back to the house.

363
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,708
Can we go back to the house now?

364
00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:29,000
Dead people are just dead people.
Why are you afraid of the graveyard?

365
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:32,124
I'm not scared.
I just don't see the point.

366
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:36,476
Dead people should just be cremated.
So they won't take up space like this.

367
00:32:36,517 --> 00:32:38,771
It's better to turn the land
into housing for the living.

368
00:32:40,177 --> 00:32:42,089
You have to promise me.

369
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:46,957
When I die, please cremate my body.
And spread my ashes in the sea.

370
00:32:47,771 --> 00:32:51,167
I might get reincarnated as a fish.
It's better than being a human.

371
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,084
You'll get caught by fishermen
and turned into sushi.

372
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,751
I'll be a shark. And eat humans.

373
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:57,083
Sharks don't eat humans.

374
00:32:58,072 --> 00:32:59,905
Unless they're really hungry.

375
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:05,966
They're here.

376
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,312
Okay, you've seen their graves.
Now let's go.

377
00:33:14,353 --> 00:33:15,894
Hold on.

378
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:21,190
Do you know the prayer for dead people?

379
00:33:21,231 --> 00:33:22,856
You're asking me?

380
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:28,560
Just say it in Indonesian.
You think God only speaks Arabic?

381
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,700
What did you pray for anyway?

382
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:47,483
So that they rest in peace.

383
00:33:48,586 --> 00:33:50,505
Did you pray
so you can get their fortune?

384
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,666
That too.

385
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,535
Good.

386
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,919
Maya, why are there
so many children's graves?

387
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:17,038
Maybe they're not children,
just really tiny graves.

388
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:20,013
Just look at the dates.

389
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:25,353
They didn't even have names.

390
00:34:26,587 --> 00:34:29,003
What is up with your village, Maya?

391
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,958
HARJOSARI CEMETERY

392
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:51,595
COURTESY OF THE DONOWONGSO

393
00:34:52,064 --> 00:34:54,989
It seems that the villagers
don't really like your family.

394
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:35,542
Dini!

395
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,422
What?

396
00:35:36,463 --> 00:35:38,046
Did you hear something?

397
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,273
Yes.

398
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,201
I heard your annoying voice.

399
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:44,949
I'm serious.

400
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,757
I'm so tired.

401
00:35:47,798 --> 00:35:50,747
How can you sleep
in a dusty bed like this?

402
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:52,497
Shut up.

403
00:36:57,231 --> 00:36:58,939
Shit.

404
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:50,818
Dear Almighty.

405
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:58,005
Give me pain that I can bear.

406
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:28,417
What are you doing?

407
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:30,601
I think someone just died.

408
00:39:30,642 --> 00:39:31,974
Again?

409
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:42,450
Maya, where are you going?

410
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:02,734
Within two days, two people have died.

411
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,443
No wonder this village seems empty.

412
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,232
Wait!

413
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:21,679
What are we going to say?

414
00:40:22,325 --> 00:40:23,630
Just be cool.

415
00:40:37,189 --> 00:40:39,794
I heard that you came
to my house to see me.

416
00:40:39,835 --> 00:40:41,293
Yes, Sir.

417
00:40:43,265 --> 00:40:45,385
You are writing a book
about Wayang (Javanese shadow puppetry)?

418
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:48,325
For our university, Sir.
We are university students.

419
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,372
Why do you choose this village?

420
00:40:59,263 --> 00:41:03,945
We've visited other villages
that are still performing Wayang.

421
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:07,777
Then we heard about you.
So we came here.

422
00:41:14,778 --> 00:41:16,990
How old are the both of you?

423
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:18,482
We're 20 years old, Sir.

424
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,576
We are very sorry to come
during an inconvenient time.

425
00:41:24,617 --> 00:41:26,302
Don't worry about it.

426
00:41:27,997 --> 00:41:32,865
Come to my house if you want to talk.

427
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:36,763
Thank you so much, Sir.

428
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,209
We need to leave this village now.

429
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,425
What?

430
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:44,625
This place creeps me out.

431
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:46,272
They look like
they're going to eat us alive,...

432
00:41:46,313 --> 00:41:47,667
...and someone dies here
on a daily basis.

433
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:48,750
Probably just a coincidence.

434
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:50,167
No way.

435
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,281
If you're desperate
about your inheritance,...

436
00:41:52,322 --> 00:41:54,834
...we can send someone to come here
and take care of it.

437
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:57,417
You think we can afford that?

438
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:00,792
We're broke.
We can't even pay rent this month.

439
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:03,000
We'll figure something out.
We always do.

440
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:05,492
Look, we're here now.
We just have to stay a little longer.

441
00:42:05,533 --> 00:42:07,125
We may not have to spend another night.

442
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:10,188
We'll ask Ki Saptadi if the house
actually belongs to my family.

443
00:42:10,229 --> 00:42:11,568
Then, we go.

444
00:42:14,825 --> 00:42:16,292
We have to ask him in a gentle manner.

445
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,500
Yes, a very gentle way.

446
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:19,583
I'm not sure of this idea.

447
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,958
Come on, Din. We can do this.

448
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:24,912
How are you going to ask him
about the house...

449
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:27,125
...without revealing that you're Rahayu?

450
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:30,417
It's risky.
Someone tried to kill you, remember?

451
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,834
And most likely
it was because of the house.

452
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:36,375
Understood. So let's just play along
as students.

453
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:39,560
Nobody kills students.

454
00:42:44,052 --> 00:42:45,500
I'm gonna go back to the house.

455
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:47,744
I stink like a dead racoon.
I should take a shower.

456
00:42:47,785 --> 00:42:49,646
Fine. I'll find us something to eat.

457
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:15,786
Hi, can I buy some food?

458
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,333
To eat here or to go?

459
00:43:20,374 --> 00:43:21,959
Two to go, please.

460
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,755
Rice with egg and vegetables.

461
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:34,000
Do you know anything
about that big abandoned house?

462
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,738
Do you know who it belongs to?

463
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:42,096
A family used to live there
when I was still a child.

464
00:43:42,137 --> 00:43:43,220
Who?

465
00:43:43,863 --> 00:43:45,988
(speaking in Javanese)

466
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:48,455
What did she say?

467
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:53,161
(speaking in Javanese)

468
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:57,374
My grandma said it's a house of disease.

469
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,104
What does she mean?

470
00:43:59,145 --> 00:44:03,936
She said devils used to live there
and left a horrendous disease.

471
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:50,740
We heard that you two
spent a night here.

472
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:52,819
It's not allowed, Miss.

473
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:56,750
So sorry.
We couldn't find another place.

474
00:44:56,791 --> 00:45:02,041
This old house
has been abandoned for a long time.

475
00:45:03,205 --> 00:45:06,163
It's not safe. The roof might fall off.

476
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:09,083
I know. Thank you for your concern.
We're leaving soon.

477
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:14,624
I know it's a pity
a house this big is unoccupied.

478
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:19,935
But it doesn't belong to us.
So we can't use it.

479
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,093
Who does it belong to?

480
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:27,122
The heir of this family. A girl.

481
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,916
Ki Saptadi has all of the documents.

482
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:35,199
He has been waiting
for the girl to claim it...

483
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,083
...so he can give back
all of the documents.

484
00:45:38,124 --> 00:45:41,499
So this house will no longer
be his responsibility.

485
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:47,591
Is the girl's name Rahayu?

486
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:50,966
Yes. How do you know?

487
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:54,021
Because...

488
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:57,513
...I am Rahayu.

489
00:46:04,443 --> 00:46:11,763
Well, Ki Saptadi is about to go
to another village.

490
00:46:11,804 --> 00:46:18,755
If you can meet him now,
he can give you the documents.

491
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:25,613
Where's your friend?

492
00:46:25,654 --> 00:46:28,146
She's getting us something to eat.

493
00:46:28,187 --> 00:46:31,193
She really is a college student.
I'm accompanying her.

494
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,584
Well, it's up to you.

495
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:40,912
If you want to wait until Ki Saptadi
is back from his trip,...

496
00:46:40,953 --> 00:46:45,709
...he'll return in three days.

497
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,542
Three days?

498
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:51,217
But earlier today he told us
to come to his house tonight...

499
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:53,334
...so my friend could ask him
some questions for her thesis.

500
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,833
Yes, that was before.

501
00:46:56,169 --> 00:46:59,174
But he got a sudden invitation
to perform in another village.

502
00:46:59,762 --> 00:47:01,661
And it's quite far from here.

503
00:47:03,677 --> 00:47:07,052
Okay, then. I'll go meet him now.

504
00:47:07,832 --> 00:47:09,402
We can take you to him.

505
00:47:09,443 --> 00:47:11,332
I know where he lives.

506
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:17,757
No, he is at a villager's house.
Not far from here.

507
00:47:20,828 --> 00:47:23,661
Come, we'll take you there.

508
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:29,834
Are we still far?

509
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:31,943
Just a little bit more.

510
00:47:34,916 --> 00:47:36,776
Why are we not talking the main road?

511
00:47:36,817 --> 00:47:39,650
It's closer through here.

512
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,240
I think I'd better get back.
My friend is waiting for me.

513
00:48:01,996 --> 00:48:03,621
What the hell?

514
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:16,917
Listen.

515
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:18,476
You don't have to rape me.

516
00:48:18,517 --> 00:48:21,708
I'm no virgin.
All you have to do is ask.

517
00:48:25,645 --> 00:48:27,279
Don't cut her skin.

518
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:32,716
Dini?

519
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:39,838
Dini?

520
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,872
I brought food. Aren't you hungry?

521
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:56,570
<i>The number you're calling
is not active or out of coverage area.</i>

522
00:49:56,611 --> 00:49:58,666
<i>Please try again in a few minutes.</i>

523
00:50:32,114 --> 00:50:34,552
Please...

524
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:50,161
What do you want?

525
00:50:51,169 --> 00:50:53,291
Please let me go.

526
00:50:53,755 --> 00:50:57,193
What can I do for you
to let me go? Please...

527
00:51:03,535 --> 00:51:07,816
Sir! Please help me, Sir!

528
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:09,792
I don't know what I did wrong.

529
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:14,802
If I ever wronged you,
please forgive me, Sir. I beg you...

530
00:51:23,312 --> 00:51:25,240
Rahayu...

531
00:51:28,155 --> 00:51:29,490
We're ready, Sir.

532
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:42,792
Mother…

533
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,107
Please help me, Ma'am!

534
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:51,521
What are you up to?

535
00:52:04,192 --> 00:52:06,692
There are two women
who are headed into labor soon.

536
00:52:07,161 --> 00:52:11,029
If we hurry, we might be able
to save their babies.

537
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:02,036
I assumed you weren't coming.

538
00:53:02,574 --> 00:53:05,657
Are you here for the interview?

539
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:09,623
Actually, I'm looking for my friend.

540
00:53:09,664 --> 00:53:11,539
The one who was with me earlier
when we met.

541
00:53:12,476 --> 00:53:14,138
Why is she not with you?

542
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:16,819
I don't know. I left to buy some food...

543
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,029
...and when I returned
she wasn't at the house.

544
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:24,291
I will ask someone to look for her.

545
00:53:25,187 --> 00:53:29,849
You can wait for her here if you want.

546
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,273
That's okay. Thank you for your help.

547
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,564
But I want to keep looking for her.

548
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:44,091
Very well.
I hope you're able to find her soon.

549
00:53:45,575 --> 00:53:46,810
Thank you, Sir.

550
00:53:46,851 --> 00:53:48,240
You're welcome.

551
00:57:29,932 --> 00:57:32,307
Our baby is going to be alright.

552
00:58:03,437 --> 00:58:05,745
Excuse me, Miss.

553
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:08,458
You can watch from the other side, Miss.

554
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:13,175
I want to ask Ki Saptadi
if he has any information...

555
00:58:13,216 --> 00:58:15,177
...on my missing friend.

556
00:58:16,255 --> 00:58:21,167
We've looked for her everywhere,
but we weren't able to find her.

557
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:22,950
We'll look again
after this show finishes.

558
00:58:25,306 --> 00:58:28,427
All right. Thank you.

559
00:59:16,749 --> 00:59:19,505
<i>The number you are calling
is not active.</i>

560
00:59:35,158 --> 00:59:38,990
Where are you, Dini?

561
01:00:00,562 --> 01:00:03,654
A woman is going into labour.
Come and see.

562
01:00:16,291 --> 01:00:21,655
Push.

563
01:00:21,696 --> 01:00:26,834
A little bit more. Come on.

564
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:31,500
Push.

565
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:35,857
Just one more push. You can do it.

566
01:01:26,747 --> 01:01:29,401
You said my baby
was going to be healthy!

567
01:01:29,442 --> 01:01:31,237
You're a liar!

568
01:01:31,278 --> 01:01:32,615
A liar!

569
01:01:40,408 --> 01:01:48,052
I'm doing all I can to help you
and everybody in this village.

570
01:01:51,437 --> 01:01:53,478
Damn you!

571
01:01:56,583 --> 01:02:02,419
Will my baby still be cursed?

572
01:02:31,029 --> 01:02:32,625
What are you doing here?

573
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,443
I'm just wandering around.

574
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:35,787
Go home.

575
01:02:35,828 --> 01:02:38,346
I want to see the baby.

576
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:39,803
Go home!

577
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,976
Come with me.

578
01:02:56,758 --> 01:02:58,706
Don't worry.

579
01:02:58,747 --> 01:03:01,083
I'm not like the others.

580
01:03:01,562 --> 01:03:02,904
Come.

581
01:03:10,819 --> 01:03:13,194
What's going on in this village?

582
01:03:13,732 --> 01:03:15,917
What's wrong with the babies?

583
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:20,771
I will tell you. Come.

584
01:03:21,687 --> 01:03:24,062
I have to find my friend.

585
01:03:24,625 --> 01:03:27,541
I will help you look for her.

586
01:03:27,963 --> 01:03:30,365
But for now you have to hide.

587
01:03:30,929 --> 01:03:33,052
It's not safe.

588
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:49,346
Come. I live by myself.

589
01:03:49,387 --> 01:03:53,482
Please come in. Don't worry.

590
01:04:02,241 --> 01:04:04,161
My name is Ratih.

591
01:04:05,715 --> 01:04:08,138
I'm not a bad person.

592
01:04:09,118 --> 01:04:11,560
The baby I saw…

593
01:04:12,888 --> 01:04:14,756
It's cursed.

594
01:04:14,797 --> 01:04:15,880
What?

595
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:19,750
This whole village is cursed.

596
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:22,457
A cursed village? In this day and age?

597
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:31,630
Didn't you notice
anything peculiar about this village?

598
01:04:32,974 --> 01:04:38,675
Haven't you noticed
there are no children here?

599
01:04:38,716 --> 01:04:40,335
I saw three girls last night.

600
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,834
That's impossible.

601
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:47,263
There hasn't been children
in this village in 20 years.

602
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,288
What do you mean?

603
01:04:50,775 --> 01:04:54,781
There was once a very rich man
in this village.

604
01:04:54,822 --> 01:04:57,113
He was our village elder.

605
01:04:57,804 --> 01:05:00,232
He and his family lived
in that big abandoned house.

606
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:03,750
They had many servants.

607
01:05:04,262 --> 01:05:09,622
One of them was Nyi Misni,
Ki Saptadi's mother.

608
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:12,791
The village elder had a son.

609
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:15,755
His name was Ki Donowongso.

610
01:05:21,718 --> 01:05:28,083
When his father died,
Ki Donowongso inherited all the wealth.

611
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:35,550
He was not only rich,
but also a brilliant puppet master.

612
01:05:35,591 --> 01:05:39,068
He was so good
at making the puppets, too.

613
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:43,146
He was also famous
among the neighbouring villages.

614
01:05:46,388 --> 01:05:52,083
Then there was Nyai Shinta,
the most beautiful woman in the village.

615
01:05:52,461 --> 01:05:55,461
All the men wished to be her husband.

616
01:05:56,031 --> 01:05:59,531
But Ki Donowongso
succeeded in marrying Nyai Shinta.

617
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:04,919
It was a huge wedding.
The party lasted for seven days.

618
01:06:08,052 --> 01:06:11,608
Unfortunately,
after three years of marriage,...

619
01:06:11,649 --> 01:06:14,615
...they could not bear a child.

620
01:06:15,825 --> 01:06:22,154
Nyai Shinta was depressed and ashamed.

621
01:06:23,857 --> 01:06:31,269
Finally, after five years of trying,
Nyai Shinta got pregnant.

622
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:37,263
Ki Donowongso
really took care of his wife.

623
01:06:38,271 --> 01:06:42,289
They held a party every Saturday night.

624
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:45,966
He would perform
with his puppets all night long.

625
01:06:54,115 --> 01:06:55,744
The weird thing is,...

626
01:06:55,785 --> 01:07:00,865
...no one knew about
the baby's condition after it was born.

627
01:07:02,064 --> 01:07:05,189
And no one ever saw the baby.

628
01:07:05,603 --> 01:07:07,122
What do you mean?

629
01:07:09,497 --> 01:07:12,396
The baby was born without skin.

630
01:07:17,607 --> 01:07:21,457
Since then, Ki Donowongso refused
to mingle with the villagers.

631
01:07:23,193 --> 01:07:25,218
Not long after that,...

632
01:07:25,259 --> 01:07:30,552
...a five-year-old girl
in the village went missing.

633
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:34,208
She was never found.

634
01:07:34,755 --> 01:07:40,294
Soon after that,
two more girls went missing.

635
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:48,779
One day, the villagers saw
Ki Donowongso's baby for the first time.

636
01:07:51,064 --> 01:07:54,230
She looked so healthy, so beautiful.

637
01:07:55,568 --> 01:07:59,416
It was only then that the village
learned the baby was named Rahayu.

638
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:03,409
A rumor started to spread
among the villagers.

639
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:06,506
Saying that Rahayu's father
had something to do...

640
01:08:06,547 --> 01:08:09,685
...with the three missing girls.

641
01:08:10,607 --> 01:08:15,417
But no one dared to confront him.

642
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:18,622
Until one night…

643
01:08:19,232 --> 01:08:23,875
Ki Saptadi said Ki Donowongso
had been practicing black magic,...

644
01:08:23,916 --> 01:08:29,599
...making a pact with the devil
to protect his daughter.

645
01:08:31,734 --> 01:08:33,734
But then he went mad.

646
01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:03,463
It was said that a loyal servant
took his daughter away to the city.

647
01:09:03,504 --> 01:09:07,625
And ever since that day,
the village has been cursed.

648
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:13,457
Every baby has been born without skin.

649
01:09:15,056 --> 01:09:17,181
Why do they have to kill the babies?

650
01:09:18,919 --> 01:09:24,584
Because if they were allowed to live,
they would be living in misery.

651
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:28,666
You don't know that.
Perhaps there is a cure.

652
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:33,465
No. There's one baby
who was allowed to live.

653
01:09:34,043 --> 01:09:36,168
He now lives in the forest.

654
01:09:37,187 --> 01:09:39,312
Uncured and in constant pain.

655
01:09:40,216 --> 01:09:46,685
Ki Saptadi said
in order to lift the curse,...

656
01:09:46,726 --> 01:09:50,857
...the first girl who got the disease,
Rahayu, has to be skinned...

657
01:09:50,898 --> 01:09:55,560
...and her skin has to be made
into leather puppets.

658
01:10:01,168 --> 01:10:04,904
Why do the villagers
believe in Ki Saptadi's words?

659
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:11,021
Who else do we have to look up to here?

660
01:10:13,841 --> 01:10:20,386
Is there anything else we should do?

661
01:10:20,427 --> 01:10:22,521
Did we miss something?

662
01:10:25,637 --> 01:10:29,075
We got the wrong girl!

663
01:10:38,228 --> 01:10:40,061
You must be hungry.
I'll get you some food.

664
01:10:41,416 --> 01:10:43,292
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

665
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:45,208
I'll get you some rice.

666
01:11:42,116 --> 01:11:44,241
Who's that in the picture?

667
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:55,667
My husband.

668
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:57,255
Listen up!

669
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:02,584
The woman we've been looking for
is here in this village.

670
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:03,667
Yes!

671
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:05,751
You know what she looks like.

672
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:06,876
Yes!

673
01:12:06,917 --> 01:12:08,251
Get her!

674
01:12:08,292 --> 01:12:10,779
Look for the girl!

675
01:12:11,529 --> 01:12:13,416
Block all the village's exits.

676
01:12:14,185 --> 01:12:18,958
The curse will be lifted soon!

677
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,311
Where is your husband now?

678
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:28,487
He went to the city three months ago.

679
01:12:28,528 --> 01:12:30,528
He was looking for a cure.

680
01:12:31,895 --> 01:12:33,732
Cure for what?

681
01:13:03,736 --> 01:13:05,736
Can you feel that?

682
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:14,646
My great grandmother, whom you met
at the kiosk, is a good shaman.

683
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:21,082
She said if someone made a pact
with the devil,...

684
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:25,956
...and a curse is born,
it can never be reversed.

685
01:13:25,997 --> 01:13:28,122
It will only transform
into another curse.

686
01:13:29,895 --> 01:13:35,947
That's why I don't believe
in killing you, Rahayu.

687
01:13:35,988 --> 01:13:39,118
It will not lift the curse.

688
01:13:48,874 --> 01:13:53,942
And that's why I asked my husband
to search for a cure in the city.

689
01:13:54,665 --> 01:13:57,091
I believe he will be able to find it.

690
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:14,103
Did you see the city girl?

691
01:14:15,489 --> 01:14:16,945
City girl?

692
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:20,888
Yes, two city girls came to our village.

693
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,500
One of them is Ki Donowongso's daughter.

694
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:27,750
Ki Saptadi killed the other one.
The wrong one.

695
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:31,786
They skinned her, turned her skin
into leather puppets. What a waste.

696
01:14:34,254 --> 01:14:35,670
What do you think you're doing?

697
01:14:36,968 --> 01:14:39,171
You won't share some food
with your neighbors now?

698
01:14:39,212 --> 01:14:41,773
No. Please go.

699
01:14:41,814 --> 01:14:43,689
Why are you so hostile?

700
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:49,874
Are you lonely because your husband
has been away long?

701
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:53,591
Do you want me to stay with you tonight?

702
01:14:54,619 --> 01:14:58,208
How long since you've seen
a man's erection?

703
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:04,005
Get out.

704
01:15:04,462 --> 01:15:07,739
Just stab me.

705
01:15:13,538 --> 01:15:16,136
Or I'll kill myself.

706
01:15:16,177 --> 01:15:22,739
Then my ghost will haunt you
for the rest of your life.

707
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:34,458
Pigs!

708
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:38,286
Come on, Miss.

709
01:15:52,103 --> 01:15:56,603
I'm so sorry about your friend.

710
01:15:57,244 --> 01:15:59,994
I need to get out of this village
as soon as possible.

711
01:16:00,888 --> 01:16:06,636
Stay here for a while.
It's not safe out there.

712
01:16:06,677 --> 01:16:08,625
They won't come again.

713
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:10,749
We don't know that.

714
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:14,957
At least if I run now, I might be able
to escape from the villagers.

715
01:16:17,429 --> 01:16:18,845
Dini...

716
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:25,544
Dini. My best friend.

717
01:16:27,981 --> 01:16:31,045
This is all my fault.

718
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:34,591
No, it's not.

719
01:16:35,411 --> 01:16:40,255
It's the work of the devil
and weak humans.

720
01:16:42,072 --> 01:16:44,364
Do you have a mobile phone?

721
01:17:16,106 --> 01:17:17,356
Hello?

722
01:17:17,997 --> 01:17:25,667
Miss? I'm with a police officer.
We're on our way.

723
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:29,903
We're taking a motorbike so it's faster.
We're almost there.

724
01:17:30,166 --> 01:17:32,217
Thank you. I'll be there.

725
01:17:32,258 --> 01:17:33,317
They're almost there.

726
01:17:34,666 --> 01:17:37,972
She said to meet her
at the North Entrance.

727
01:17:38,013 --> 01:17:39,375
I know where it is.

728
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:41,251
Then, can we drive faster?

729
01:17:41,292 --> 01:17:42,708
This the fastest I can go.

730
01:17:58,392 --> 01:18:00,645
I've met your husband.

731
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:05,333
He tried to kill me.

732
01:18:06,028 --> 01:18:09,458
I was working and he came to me.
He tried to kill me.

733
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:14,255
He was shot by the policeman, and died.

734
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,919
Please forgive me, Ratih.

735
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,584
Is this it?

736
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:36,317
Yes, this is the North Entrance.

737
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:47,830
Brother Suryo.

738
01:18:47,871 --> 01:18:49,380
Evening, Brother.

739
01:18:50,622 --> 01:18:52,330
Bambang?

740
01:18:53,224 --> 01:18:56,919
I told you to stay put.
I can handle this by myself.

741
01:18:57,801 --> 01:18:59,687
We just want to help.

742
01:18:59,728 --> 01:19:01,436
Who are you, people?

743
01:19:01,915 --> 01:19:03,623
We're from this village.

744
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:05,651
You know them?

745
01:19:05,692 --> 01:19:10,505
I'm from here, too. Me and my wife.

746
01:19:11,528 --> 01:19:13,236
Didn't I tell you?

747
01:19:13,922 --> 01:19:15,552
No, you didn't.

748
01:19:16,599 --> 01:19:18,417
- Listen, Mister?
- I'm Nano.

749
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:19,656
Don't worry, Mr. Nano.

750
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,626
Our village is safe
and the villagers are friendly.

751
01:19:23,310 --> 01:19:25,417
Give me your phone.

752
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:26,501
No.

753
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:27,845
- Just for a minute.
- No!

754
01:19:28,473 --> 01:19:30,119
Are you testing my patience?

755
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,208
Fuck you!

756
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:49,167
Over there!

757
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:51,126
Where is she?

758
01:19:52,129 --> 01:19:53,345
Find her!

759
01:21:13,051 --> 01:21:14,875
Sir, help me. People are chasing me.
They want to rape me.

760
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:16,124
Get in!

761
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:17,792
I'll just ride at the back.
I don't want them to see me.

762
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,134
Okay, hurry!

763
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

764
01:21:30,714 --> 01:21:31,955
Help.

765
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,438
Hurry!

766
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:13,667
Find her!

767
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:15,087
Don't let her get away!

768
01:23:15,796 --> 01:23:19,437
You will forget.

769
01:23:22,236 --> 01:23:25,617
The unborn shall perish.

770
01:23:36,517 --> 01:23:38,125
Good morning, Miss.

771
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:51,334
She must be here!

772
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:52,125
Find her! Now!

773
01:23:52,166 --> 01:23:53,790
Come on! She must be here! Get her!

774
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:34,333
Hurry, find her!

775
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:35,875
Don't let her get away!

776
01:25:35,916 --> 01:25:36,957
Get her!

777
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:52,859
Blood for blood.

778
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:08,709
Hurry!

779
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:10,375
She has nowhere to run!

780
01:28:35,054 --> 01:28:41,124
Bury our skin with our bones,
and the curse will be gone.

781
01:28:41,742 --> 01:28:47,390
Maya! Wake up!
We have to get out of here.

782
01:28:58,203 --> 01:28:59,658
What is that place?

783
01:28:59,699 --> 01:29:04,773
It's where Tole lives,
the cursed child who was kept alive.

784
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:06,702
I want to see him.

785
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:08,750
You have to go now.

786
01:29:08,791 --> 01:29:11,132
I want to see him.

787
01:29:25,328 --> 01:29:28,413
Who's there?

788
01:29:28,454 --> 01:29:31,704
It's me. Ratih.

789
01:29:32,865 --> 01:29:38,953
I'm hungry. I want food.

790
01:29:42,072 --> 01:29:45,007
Who is that, Ratih?

791
01:29:50,465 --> 01:29:53,757
I will be back with food.

792
01:30:04,067 --> 01:30:06,233
It's all my fault.

793
01:30:07,116 --> 01:30:09,074
It is not.

794
01:30:11,043 --> 01:30:14,959
But I can make things right.

795
01:30:21,613 --> 01:30:23,863
Why are you still helping me?

796
01:30:25,017 --> 01:30:28,683
Hating you will not change anything.

797
01:30:30,161 --> 01:30:33,452
They will hurt you
if they know you're helping me.

798
01:30:34,361 --> 01:30:38,898
They've hurt me all my life.

799
01:30:39,773 --> 01:30:46,148
Let's just do whatever you plan to do.

800
01:31:10,453 --> 01:31:12,536
What is that?

801
01:31:15,189 --> 01:31:17,242
The skin of the missing girls.

802
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

803
01:33:29,572 --> 01:33:32,140
Your work here is done.

804
01:33:34,278 --> 01:33:37,156
You must go before it's too late.

805
01:33:37,601 --> 01:33:41,726
I'm not going anywhere
until I know that the curse is gone.

806
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:47,944
A woman is going into labor tonight.

807
01:33:49,673 --> 01:33:51,132
We'll wait and see.

808
01:34:05,541 --> 01:34:11,041
I used to live in this house.

809
01:34:17,031 --> 01:34:28,429
This is where Donowongso's father
used to fuck me.

810
01:34:29,547 --> 01:34:34,916
This is also where I gave birth
to Saptadi.

811
01:34:35,664 --> 01:34:38,125
Go to the woman who is in labor.

812
01:34:38,166 --> 01:34:40,562
Please go now!

813
01:34:45,734 --> 01:34:54,624
Of course I didn't tell him
that Saptadi was his illegitimate son.

814
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:59,931
I never asked him
to take any responsibility for Saptadi.

815
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,838
I knew my place.

816
01:35:04,389 --> 01:35:08,109
This is all your fault.

817
01:35:09,095 --> 01:35:12,803
Even before I was born,
you tried to destroy me.

818
01:35:13,336 --> 01:35:17,226
You started this curse.

819
01:35:24,483 --> 01:35:26,441
You...

820
01:35:27,585 --> 01:35:31,085
...are a mistake
that I need to erase.

821
01:35:43,243 --> 01:35:45,326
Don't come near me!

822
01:35:47,343 --> 01:35:49,259
Don't come near me!

823
01:35:50,708 --> 01:35:51,914
Stay away!

824
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:40,270
Sir, please, let me go.

825
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:46,109
Sir, please, let me go home.

826
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:48,328
We have to do this.

827
01:36:49,383 --> 01:36:50,588
Please understand.

828
01:36:50,629 --> 01:36:53,461
Sir, everything is alright now.

829
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:57,015
There will be no more curse.

830
01:36:57,375 --> 01:37:00,148
No more babies
will be born without skin.

831
01:37:03,103 --> 01:37:04,568
What?

832
01:37:04,609 --> 01:37:08,498
The three little girls,
the ones that were never found...

833
01:37:08,539 --> 01:37:11,292
My father buried them inside the house.

834
01:37:11,333 --> 01:37:14,078
In the basement.
Their spirits came to me.

835
01:37:15,117 --> 01:37:18,110
They asked me to bury the puppets
that were made from their skin...

836
01:37:18,151 --> 01:37:20,649
...in the same location
where their bones were buried.

837
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:22,167
So they can rest in peace.

838
01:37:22,208 --> 01:37:24,374
I've done everything
that they asked me to do.

839
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:30,672
Go look. The puppets are gone
from your house.

840
01:37:34,664 --> 01:37:36,830
Please, Sir.

841
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:40,206
Please, Sir. I'm not lying.

842
01:37:45,031 --> 01:37:48,984
Please, Sir. I'm actually your daughter.

843
01:37:51,004 --> 01:37:52,568
What did you say?

844
01:37:52,609 --> 01:37:55,023
I'm your daughter.

845
01:37:56,109 --> 01:37:59,625
I know everything.
I am your child, Father.

846
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:02,002
Yours and Nyai Shinta's.

847
01:38:02,043 --> 01:38:04,429
Grandma put a spell on you to forget.

848
01:38:04,953 --> 01:38:06,494
Don't listen to her!

849
01:38:06,757 --> 01:38:11,416
Grandmother! What have I done
to deserve this?

850
01:38:13,164 --> 01:38:17,834
I've been living in misery all my life.

851
01:38:17,875 --> 01:38:22,366
You brought me into this world.
Now you want to kill me.

852
01:38:22,407 --> 01:38:25,157
Shut up!

853
01:38:33,434 --> 01:38:35,725
Is this true, Mother?

854
01:38:42,164 --> 01:38:47,195
This is all your fault.

855
01:38:49,630 --> 01:38:52,812
You dare to talk that way
to your mother?

856
01:38:52,853 --> 01:38:55,429
Enough!

857
01:38:57,688 --> 01:39:02,922
I've had enough with you
controlling my life.

858
01:39:08,508 --> 01:39:12,015
It's her, or your mother.

859
01:39:14,875 --> 01:39:18,416
My wife's in labor, Sir.

860
01:39:22,504 --> 01:39:25,625
It's me or her!

861
01:39:26,543 --> 01:39:27,750
Father...

862
01:39:30,616 --> 01:39:32,906
The baby's healthy!

863
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:35,601
Please...

864
01:39:35,642 --> 01:39:36,892
Oh Dear...

865
01:39:37,963 --> 01:39:40,617
Give me back my baby!

866
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:44,498
Please.

867
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:46,843
You have to die!

868
01:40:41,726 --> 01:40:43,476
Our child.

869
01:40:55,790 --> 01:40:57,584
You have to go now.

870
01:40:57,625 --> 01:40:59,000
Come with me.

871
01:40:59,041 --> 01:41:01,418
It doesn't matter where I go.
My life will be the same.

872
01:41:01,459 --> 01:41:03,140
Go!

873
01:42:15,544 --> 01:42:17,640
Go! Go now!

874
01:42:21,257 --> 01:42:23,406
Hurry!

875
01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:03,734
The baby is healthy.

876
01:43:07,165 --> 01:43:09,757
Of course he is.

877
01:43:10,765 --> 01:43:13,609
He keeps kicking me, honey.

878
01:43:15,117 --> 01:43:17,312
Maybe he hates me.

879
01:43:17,936 --> 01:43:19,625
Of course he hates you.

880
01:43:20,343 --> 01:43:21,959
He knows that you've knocked me up.

881
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,437
And are putting me through a hard time.

882
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:28,201
This is what happens to pregnant women.

883
01:43:28,242 --> 01:43:30,867
