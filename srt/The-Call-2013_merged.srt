<i>I need a police officer, 119
East Central Street, 3rd floor.</i>

3
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,051
<i>I got a woman here,
she's stabbing herself and a child!</i>

4
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,481
<i>Operator 602,
state your emergency, please.</i>

5
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,644
<i>Hi, there's an
accident on Highway 28,</i>

6
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,246
<i>and I... I...
Like, I think somebody's dead.</i>

7
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,081
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

8
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,891
<i>I'm at the Beverly Resort.
My girlfriend, she's...</i>

9
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,161
<i>What's going on there?</i>

10
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,209
<i>She jumped from
the 12th floor balcony.</i>

11
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,124
<i>She jumped off
the 12th floor balcony?</i>

12
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,328
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

13
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,281
<i>Oh, God, I hit someone with my car.</i>

14
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,806
<i>I hit him! I think I've killed him!</i>

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,761
<i>All right, listen carefully.
Pump the chest hard 30 times.</i>

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,208
<i>And count out loud with him
so he does it right.</i>

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,289
<i>You need to count out loud,
go ahead.</i>

<i>Please, I need assistance right away.</i>

911, where's your emergency?

22
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,605
There's a lot of blood, I know, but you
need to keep pressure on the wound.

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,847
<i>I shot my wife.</i>

24
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,441

25
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,441

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,007
<i>My wife is dying, and the nurses
here, they don't wanna help her out.</i>

00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,480
- Where's Mommy?
<i>- Downstairs.</i>

28
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,369

<i>- Yeah.</i>

How old are you?
Okay, okay, calm down, honey.

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,961
What's your name?

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,361
<i>Officer down. Corner

<i>- I think I'm having an overdose</i>

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,567
<i>and so is my wife. I don't know if it...</i>

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,960
Just try to relax.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,640
911, where's your emergency?

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,209
- Is the baby breathing?
<i>- He's breathing.</i>

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,725
Okay, good, I want you to...

39
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,400
If I'm gonna help,
you gotta work with me. Slow down.

40
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,291
Stay on the line,
I'm gonna send police, the paramedics.

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,444
8-Adam-12, got a shooting
at Florence and Normandie.

42
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,166
Witness says that victim
has been shot in arm and face.

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,880

<i>18 Baxter.</i>

48
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,842
Okay, 18 Baxter,
is that your place or theirs?

49
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,280
<i>That's theirs.</i>
Okay.

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,250
Is that between Gary and Hemlock?
<i>Yep.</i>

51
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,647
What color's the house?
<i>It's a pale blue.</i>

52
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,803
<i>I got a shotgun,
you want me to stop them?</i>

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,286
Nope, don't do that.

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,527
<i>You sure?</i>
I'm sure.

55
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,444
I'm sending officers right now, sir.

<i>My mom's been stabbed.</i>

57
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,247
Okay, do you know who stabbed her?
<i>My uncle.</i>

58
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,602
Okay. And where?
<i>In the leg.</i>

59
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,484
Is your uncle still there?
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

60
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,041
I'm sending the police
and the paramedics right away.

61
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,891
Okay?
<i>Okay. She's pretty pissed off.</i>

62
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,570
Yeah, well, I'm sure she is.

63
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,401
- Do you understand what I'm telling you?
<i>- I don't wanna go to prison.</i>

64
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,490
Chris, put the gun down.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

65
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,727
<i>I didn't mean to do it.</i>

66
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,481
- It's not worth it.
<i>- Drop your weapon!</i>

67
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,451
Put the gun dow... Chris! Chris!
Chris, I need you to...

68
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,524
911, where's your emergency?

69
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,046

<i>- Goddamn it!</i>

70
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,925
<i>Why am I in here?</i>

71
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,205
Hi, Terrance. How you doing?
<i>Not good, sugar.</i>

72
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,930
<i>I'm in jail.</i>

73
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,487
<i>And nobody tell me shit,
why I'm here.</i>

74
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,685
You been drinking again?
<i>Yeah, I suppose.</i>

75
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,450
Then you know what you gotta do.

76
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,962
You gotta ask your D.O.
for another call, okay?

77
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,208
You know this line
is for emergencies only.

78
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,049
<i>All right. Thanks, sugar.</i>
Okay.

79
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,322
Try to stay out of trouble.
Okay, darling?

80
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,171
Okay.
<i>All right, sugar.</i>

81
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,610
Still calling us "sugar," huh?
You know it.

82
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,643
Cara lose that little tooth yet?
Nope.

83
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,808
Lou wants to pull it
but I won't let him.

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,844
Ooh. Why men gotta be
so brutal? Heh, heh.

85
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,088
Here comes a couple.
Why don't you ask them?

86
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,725
Somebody call for strippers?

87
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,726
Hey, sexy.
My boss. She's right there.

88
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,410
What? The queen bee?

89
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,602
I understand you
delivered a baby yesterday.

90
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,240
You know, 7-pound, 3-ounce
little princess.

91
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,602
No big deal.
Look at him, trying to be humble.

92
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,450
He saved the mother's life.

93
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,130
- Oh.
- That's all he did.

94
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,203
Impressive.
So tell your friend.

95
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,169
Mm-mm. She don't like cops.

96
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,169
What kind of person
doesn't date a cop?

97
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,604
We're brave, honest, I got a great body.
Oh, God.

98
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,202
Well, I like cops. I'll date you.
She knows what I'm talking about.

99
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,290
Okay, while y'all talk about that,
I'm gonna take a break.

100
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,166
- Break time.
- Yes.

101
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,209
One of these times
I'm gonna get it.

102
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,010
You live 10 minutes away?

103
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,880
Ten minutes away?
We can make it there in five.

104
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,843
Ha-ha-ha. You are a
bad, bad, bad cop.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,401
Yeah, you bring
the worst out in me.

106
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,331
What time does your shift
start tomorrow?

107
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,649
Six a.m. Why?

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,321
You wanna ride in together?

109
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,244
Is that an invitation?

110
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,044
I accept the invitation
only if I get to make the coffee this time.

111
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,050
Okay. But I don't like
my coffee too strong.

112
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,208
I don't like mine see-through,
so...

113
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,325
So do we got a problem?

114
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,562
Call 911, we got a problem.

115
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,086
Then I want you to take the child
in your arms

116
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,243
and exit the building quickly.

117
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,807
Hey, hey, hey, when this thing
with Phillips start?

118
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,771
I'm devastated.
You missed your chance, Marco.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,241
Oh, wait. I had a chance? Wait.

120
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,091
Hey, Jordan, what's the code
for a multiple stabbing?

121
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,087
- Uh... Two forty-five.
- Hey, lovebird?

122
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,405
Focus, my sweet, focus.
I am.

123
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,806
911, where's your emergency?

124
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,442
<i>A man is trying to
break into my house. I'm all alone.</i>

125
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,080
Okay, sweetheart, calm down.
<i>My parents are out.</i>

126
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,129
<i>They're at a movie.
I can't reach them.</i>

127
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,244
I understand that, sweetheart.
Can you get out of the house?

128
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,240
No, he... He's out there.
<i>It's okay, I've got your information.</i>

129
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,408
Just hold on, sweetheart.

130
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,809
Any units clear to handle hot prowl

sweetheart, okay?
<i>What's your name?</i>
Leah. Leah Templeton.
How old are you, Leah?
Oh, God.

135
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,803
He broke the window.
He's coming in the back.

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,209
Leah, listen to me. Find a room
and lock yourself in it right now.

137
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,446
Leah. Stay on the line with me,
sweetheart.

138
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,484
Do not disconnect, okay? Leah?

139
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,409
<i>Leah?</i>
I'm upstairs in my room.

140
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,083
But the door, it won't lock.
He's in the house.

141
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,603
7-Adam-13, what's your ETA?

142
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,161
<i>Eight to 10.</i>

143
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,721
<i>I don't know where to hide.</i>
Okay, Leah.

144
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,809
- He's gonna find me.
<i>- Here's what I need.</i>

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,729
Is there a window in the room?
<i>Yes.</i>

146
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,967
Okay.

147
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,650
Leah. Don't speak. Stay quiet, okay?
Officers are gonna be there any second.

148
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,482
I'm okay.

149
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,327
I think it worked. He left.

150
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,044
I think he's going back downstairs.

151
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,164
Leah?

152
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,401
Leah.

153
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,726
<i>Leah. You okay?</i>
It's okay. I'm fine.

154
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,361
He's gone.
Okay, good.

155
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,086
I think he's going back outside.

156
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,042
Oh, God. I think he's coming back.

157
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,930
I think he heard the phone ring.

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

159
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,767
Shut it.
Please don't hurt me.

<i>Please don't hurt me.</i>

161

Okay, listen, whoever this is, the police
are on their way right this second.

162
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,047
I suggest you leave that house

163
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,842
before you do anything
you're gonna regret.

164
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,564
<i>It's already done.</i>

165
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,730
Oh, God.

166
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,490
Oh, God.

167
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,410
Excuse me.

168
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,884
Oh, God.

169
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,408
Oh, God.

170
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,680
What happened back there?

171
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,962
The ring gave her away.

172
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,249
Just help me, and tell me
what you were thinking.

173
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,241
I wasn't. I...

174
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,762
I don't know, I just...
I wasn't focused or what...

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,684
Okay.
I normally am,

176
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,327
and I don't know, I just wasn't.

177
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,364
I just wasn't. I wasn't.

178
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

179
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,522
Jor.

180
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,287
Just came by to check on you.

181
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,884
Jordan.

182
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,163
Come on, Jordan,
I know you're in there.

183
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,770
Just came by to see what's up,
see if you're good.

184
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,328
<i>L.A. county police continue</i>

185
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,761
<i>their search for missing teen
Leah Templeton,</i>

186
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,045
<i>who was allegedly abducted from
her home in Hancock Park last night.</i>

187
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,288
<i>L.A.P.D. sources
say the lack of witnesses</i>

188
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,211
<i>and evidence in the case
are frustrating the effort.</i>

189
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,051
<i>Templeton's family issued
a statement late last night...</i>

190
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,362
911, where's your emergency?

191
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,325
911, where's your emergency?

192
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,042
- How old are you?
- Okay.

193
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,885
Calm down, ma'am.
What's your name?

194
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,841
Hey, hon.
You gonna be okay?

195
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,251
911, what is your
emergency? Yes, sir.

196
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,681
Sir, please calm down.

197
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,962
Yes, I understand.

198
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,769
Yes, the corner of Santa Monica...

199
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,528
911, where's your emergency?

200
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,640
<i>Send someone! There's a bat!</i>

201
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,049
<i>Yeah, a bat flying around
my daughter's bedroom! Aah!</i>

202
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,645
<i>Oh, my God, there it is again!</i>

203
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,129
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>
Yeah. Yeah.

204
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,601
<i>Please send somebody!</i>
Yeah, I'm here. Uh...

205
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,928
<i>Anyone, please.</i>
Okay.

206
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,646
I am gonna have Animal Control
there right away.

207
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,690
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>
Okay.

208
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,927
No problem. No problem.

209
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,131
- 911, what's your emergency?
<i>- Goddamn it!</i>

210
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,926
<i>What did I do wrong, sugar, huh?
Huh?</i>

211
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,401
Hey, Terrance.
<i>It ain't my fault. Ain't my fault.</i>

212
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,801
How you doing?

213
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,844
<i>And he spilled my beer.
So I pushed him back.</i>

214
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,047
Everybody's looking for you
down there.

215
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,844
You know they can't run
that place without you.

216
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,809
You Okay?

217
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,125
Jor, now, why you
beating yourself up over this?

218
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,966
You've had bad calls before, Jor.

219
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,565
My daddy told me the hardest
part about being a cop

220
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,321
was knowing you might be
the difference

221
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,003
between somebody living
and somebody dying.

222
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,931
And when you couldn't
shoulder that,

223
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,091
then it's time for you to get out.

224
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,365
So that's what you're gonna do?

225
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,889
I'll be here when you need me.

226
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,161
You know that, right?

227
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,680
<i>911, where's your emergency?</i>

228
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,569
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

229
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,449
<i>Daddy, stop them all!</i>

230
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,524
- All right, bye.
- What was that about?

231
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,530
She's just...
"Casey can do a great grown-up voice."

232
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,284
And you're like, "She's awesome."

233
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,528
She, like, can't lie to her mom. Yeah.

234
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,122
No, that's... That's...
That's stupid. Bye.

235
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,761
Ugh. Let's eat.
I'm starving like a motherfucker.

236
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,928
Oh, my God, you are so foul,
Autumn.

237
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,884
Hey, call me a bitch.
What?

238
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,530
I wanna hear you say it.
No.

239
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,240
Just say... Just say "bitch."
I wanna hear you say it.

240
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,771
No.
You can't do it.

241
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,691
No, I can, it's just you're not.
You're a jerk.

242
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,930
Oh, are you kidding me?

243
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,441
Raul thought that we
should have one just for us.

244
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,802
He bought that to keep tabs on you.
He didn't.

245
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,284
My parents keep checking their bill.
TracFones are prepaid. Under the radar.

246
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,606
Ugh. He's so high-maintenance.
Hey, lover.

247
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,807
No, we're shopping. What do you think?
I was gonna call you in two minutes.

248
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,401
You wanna do what to me?
Oh, you're disgusting.

249
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,011
Is that even legal?

250
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,168
So first you're gonna notice patterns.

251
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,403
Behavioral changes
in very predictable ways.

252
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,003
Rising temperatures means rising
tempers, so we get the violent calls.

253
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,125
Rainy days and Christmas, it's gloomy
outside, sometimes people are alone,

254
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,288
that's when we get the suicides.

255
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,288
Now, Saturday mornings are generally
very slow and calm times,

256
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,847
and I think that's because
people are at home

257
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,647
probably recovering from Friday night.
Why? What happens Friday night?

258
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,365
All hell breaks loose.

259
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,362
<i>Half your calls are gonna be
non-emergencies.</i>

260
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,610
Half of those, that's gonna be someone
asking for directions to Starbucks

261
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,000
or how to baste a turkey.

262
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,401
Go ahead, laugh at that, that's good.
That's gonna prepare you for real stuff.

263
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,087
The jumpers, the home invasions,
the triple homicides, the gang-banging...

264
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,520
You've seen the quiet room.

265
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,126
That's where we go
to decompress after a bad call.

266
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,051
But if you need anything more than
a nap and some Muzak,

267
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,924
then you have to call our BSS.

268
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,963
That's behavioral science specialist.

269
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,731
His name is Dr. Keating,
he's on call two-four-seven

270
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,003
any time any of you need to talk.
Talk about what?

271
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,763
What's your name again?
Josh.

272
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,530
Okay, listen, Josh.

273
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,564
The most important thing to
remember about this job is this:

274
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,081
Stay emotionally detached.

275
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,448
Don't get too involved
in your P.R.'s crisis.

276
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,130
What's P.R.?
Person reporting.

277
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,685
Right. And never ever make promises
because you can't keep them.

278
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,810
Okay? Now follow me to the call floor.

279
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,448
If you're wondering why security's so
tight, we're the ears and eyes of the city.

280
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,002
We're the link between every
human crisis and every first responder.

281
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,009
That's the Fire and Police Department.

282
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,966
If the Hive goes down,
this whole city goes dark.

283
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,404
Question here.
Why do they call it the Hive?

284
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,361
Listen. Hear all those
little worker bees?

285
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,851
Hey, what about Max?
You know he wants to bone you, right?

286
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,247
Oh, my God, Autumn.
Stop it, that's disgusting.

287
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,363
No, he doesn't.
Oh, he does.

288
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,722
No, he smokes too much dope.

289
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,967
Dope?
Yeah.

290
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,568
Oh, my God, you're so cute. I'm not
telling you to make him your trainer.

291
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,964
Just come out with us Saturday night.
No. I don't like it when you set me up.

292
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,801
All right. Just trying to help you
since you never seem to help yourself.

293
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,050
I can help myself. You're not, like, my matchmaker.
I don't need you to be my mom here.

294
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,082
Oh, shit. I was supposed to pick
my brother up like 20 minutes ago.

295
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,250
What? No, you can't, you can't
leave now. I'm not even done yet.

296
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,529
Sorry.
Come on, you suck.

297
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,682
That was really good.
Call me later, okay?

298
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,601
Hey, I'm leaving the mall right now.

299
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,486
Idiot.

300
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,531
Why can't you just text me
like every other morn?

301
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,520
Yes, I know, I'm sorry, Mom,
but really, come on.

302
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Yeah, I'm on my way home now.
I'll be home soon.
Okay. Love you too. Bye.

303
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,001
Whoa!

304
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,162
Oh, my God.

305
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,165
Jeez, I'm sorry.
Dude.

306
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,011
You didn't look before you backed up?
I didn't see you.

307
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,241
All right, whatever.

308
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,131
Oh, awesome, it's broken.
Perfect. Oh!

309
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,360
This here is Brooke.
She's a probie.

310
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,325
She was exactly where
you guys are six months ago.

311
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,010
How you liking the job, Brooke?

312
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,846
It's definitely the hardest job
I've ever had.

313
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,402
- What's the hardest part?
- I guess the not knowing.

314
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,044
A lot of times
you don't know how it ends.

315
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,802
When units get to a scene, you sign off.
And they take over but you don't know.

316
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,083
I mean, did they make an arrest?
Shoot the bad guy?

317
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,727
Did the P.R. live? Did she die?
You'll get used to it.

318
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,927
911, where's your emergency?

319
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,721
Right here's where the P.R.'s
phone number comes up.

320
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,922
And the cell's GPS chip allows us

321
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,010
to get an exact lat-long coordinate
right here on this map.

322
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,046
Then over here, she can dispatch
the police to the scene at any time.

323
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,568
- Okay? Any questions?
- Yeah.

324
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,091
What about you, Ms. Turner?

325
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,367
What about me?

326
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,688
How come you're not out here
on the floor?

327
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,768
Because I'm the teacher.

328
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,082
Now, why don't you guys
follow me this way?

329
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,123
I'm gonna get you set up
for some calls.

330
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,761
Oh, my God.

331
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,247
No.

332
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,521
No, no.

333
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,410
No, no. No!

334
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,768
No! No! No!

335
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,205
No, no.

336
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,770
No.

337
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,560
So I think you guys had a good first day.
Things are gonna get a little bit harder.

338
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,691
911, where is your emergency?

339
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,163
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay, slow down, slow down.

340
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,209
Where are you?

341
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,168
Okay, where...?
I can't understand you.

342
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,643
What...? What mall?
What mall...? What mall are you at?

343
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,847
Okay, w...
No, where did he hit you?

344
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,089
<i>He didn't hit me. He
almost hit me and then I...</i>

345
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,642
Okay, where... Where is the vehicle?
<i>I don't know where the vehicle is!</i>

346
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,446
<i>I'm in the trunk.
I'm, like, in the trunk!</i>

347
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,484
Jordan. There's no location.

348
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,603
It's a disposable. No chip.
Ask her name.

349
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,524
What is your name?
What is your name?

350
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,011
Casey. Casey.

351
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,001
Casey. Okay, Casey, calm down, okay?
<i>I'm in the trunk on my friend's phone.</i>

352
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,680
- Why can't you just trace it?
<i>- We're gonna try.</i>

353
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,282
You're on a disposable phone,
so it might take us a little while.

354
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,171
What? You can't find me?

355
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,442
I just need you...
You can't find me?

356
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,484
<i>No, no, you have to find me!</i>
No. We will.

357
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,929
<i>You have to find me, please!
Please! Please, I don't...</i>

358
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,162
I don't wanna die.

359
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,490
Jordan. I don't know what to do.
She's freaking out.

360
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,001
What do I say?
<i>Please, you have to find me.</i>

361
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,885
I don't wanna die.
I don't know. What do I do?

362
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,290
<i>Please, you have to help me.
You have to help me, this is like...</i>

363
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,563
<i>He's driving. Nobody's ever
come out of anything like this.</i>

364
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,771
Hi. Casey. My name is Jordan.
Okay?

365
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,930
I'm here to help you, okay?
I was talking to another girl.

366
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,889
Can you put me on with her?
I'm here.

367
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,526
I'm gonna help you, okay?
Please, help me.

368
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,883
Casey, listen to me, sweetheart.
Okay, we are gonna...

369
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,730
<i>Please, I don't wanna die.</i>

370
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,524
Casey, you're not gonna die.

371
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,646
Breathe.

372
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,964
You've got it.
Okay.

373
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,530
Okay.
<i>I don't wanna die.</i>

374
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,524
Casey?
What?

375
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,603
<i>We are gonna find you,
okay, honey?</i>

376
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,647
You promise?
Do you promise you're gonna find me?

377
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,011
I can promise you this,
sweetheart, okay?

378
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,330
You've got the best team of people
in this whole city working to find you.

379
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,208
<i>But in order for us to help you,
I need you to help me.</i>

380
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,928
Now, can you do that, sweetheart?

381
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,768
<i>Can you do that?</i>
Okay. Okay.

382
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,207
Okay. Good girl, good girl.

383
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,643
Now, Casey, first thing I need you to do
is look inside that trunk

384
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,042
and see if you
can find a release lever.

385
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,086
Call the carrier, have them fax us
the E.C. forms so we can start the trace.

386
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,730
- Get rid of these kids.
- Okay.

387
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,730
<i>Usually it glows in the dark.
Do you see that?</i>

388
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,366
No, no, it doesn't even have
one of those.

389
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,126
Okay. Okay, it's okay, sweetheart.

390
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,766
What mall were you at
when you were abducted?

391
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,048
Fashion Plaza.
Fashion Plaza.

392
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,891
Okay. Oh, I know that one,
that's downtown, right?

393
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,925
It's okay, sweetheart.
Calm down.

394
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,889
<i>What's your last name?</i>
Welson.

395
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,088
Welson, okay.

396
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,408
Oh, my God.
Okay, I see that.

397
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,046
I got all your information
right here in front of me.

398
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,762
My mom's gonna be freaking out.
Oh, look, you're a Capricorn. Me too.

399
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,923
You know what that means, honey?
What?

400
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,090
We're fighters.
That means we were born to fight.

401
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,844
So you know what I want you to do?

402
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,486
<i>I want you to fight. Okay?</i>

403
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,041
Can you fight for me, Casey?
Yeah.

404
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,730
<i>Okay. Good girl.</i>

405
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,843
Can you describe
the man who grabbed you?

406
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,162
Was he black, white, Asian, Hispanic?
<i>White.</i>

407
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,367
<i>White, okay.</i>

408
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,887
I think. Dressed normal.
<i>What does normal mean?</i>

409
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,771
<i>Did he have on a hat? Jeans?</i>
I don't... Sunglasses.

410
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,327
He was wearing sunglasses.
Sunglasses, okay.

411
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,126
Can you guess his age?
Twenties, 30s, 40s?

412
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,290
Thirties, I think. Like mid-SOS.

413
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,403
Thirties, okay, good girl. Okay, great.

414
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,764
Honey, what color is the car?
I think it was like red or maroon.

415
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,042
<i>Okay, did it have two doors or four?</i>

416
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,123
<i>I think it had four. Four.</i>
Four, okay.

417
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,970
Hang in there. You're doing great.

418
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,128
<i>Any available units. Kidnap in progress.</i>

419
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,203
<i>Female abducted
at Fashion Plaza Mall.</i>

420
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,601
<i>450 Holloway,
approximately 15 minutes ago.</i>

421
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,644
White male, 30s, in a four-door maroon,
unknown make, model.

422
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,047
<i>P. R.'s in the trunk
on a disposable phone.</i>

423
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,890
Is that Jordan?

424
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,407
...But not enough to triangulate.
P.C.C.'s pinging.

425
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,082
Any available unit, code three.
8-Adam-16 en route, code three.

426
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,727
It's good to hear
your voice again, Jordan.

427
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,961
Okay, Casey, can you tell if you're on
a freeway or if you're on surface streets?

428
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,002
- Oh, no.
<i>- What?</i>

429
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,804
Somebody's calling.
He's gonna hear.

430
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,169
No, don't answer it.
God, no, it's Raul.

431
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,010
Do not break contact with me.

432
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,850
<i>Casey, stay on the line.</i>

433
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,884
I can't lose you. Stay on the line.
This can't be happening.

434
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,725
Can you tell me if those wheels
are going fast or slow?

435
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,331
It's like... It's like even.

436
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,960
Does it sound like a freeway
or surface streets?

437
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,323
We might be on a freeway.
Okay, good girl, good girl.

438
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,690
All available units, P.R. believes vehicle
is on the freeway, direction unknown.

439
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,289
<i>Casey, sweetheart, does the trunk smell
like it's a new trunk or an old one?</i>

440
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,211
It kind of smells like old.
<i>Okay, good.</i>

441
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,324
Yeah, there's, like, work stuff.
Okay, honey.

442
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,091
Can you see the tail lights?
What?

443
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,567
In older cars there may be
access to tail lights.

444
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,125
Look for the red glow, okay?

445
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,004
Yeah, yeah, I see it.
<i>Great.</i>

446
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,247
<i>I found it. Yeah, yeah.</i>

447
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,450
Is there any way you can kick that light?
Can you do that?

448
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,165
No, no, he's gonna hear, Jordan.

449
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,643
No, honey, we gotta try, honey.
We gotta try to get you out of there.

450
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,763
<i>I'll try.</i>
Come on, you can do it.

451
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,203
The carrier got our request.
I'm just waiting for them to call back.

452
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,447
We can't wait, Maddy.

453
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,210
You know how those prepaids work.

454
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,886
The call could be within
a five-mile radius.

455
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,202
You just keep doing what you're doing.
Okay.

456
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,727
Casey. How you doing, sweetheart?
Not coming out.

457
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,644
<i>Casey, try the other light.</i>

458
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,008
Okay.
You can do it. Fast as you can, honey.

459
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,161
<i>New music alternative.</i>

460
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,929
I did it. Jordan, I did it. I got it out.
You did it. Good work.

461
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,241
Good work, Casey.

462
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,011
<i>Now look out the hole
and tell me what you see.</i>

463
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,531
It's a freeway.

464
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,286
Okay. Okay, honey,
here's what I need you to do, okay?

465
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,127
I need you to stick your arm out
and wave it, wave it, wave it.

466
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,688
Okay, here is the plan. I wanna see
if any other car's gonna notice.

467
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,201
Okay.
<i>Let me know when you've done it, okay?</i>

468
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,241
I'm waving.
Good girl, good girl.

469
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,807
I got a P.R. waving her arm
out of a trunk of a car!

470
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,326
Let's see if we get a call.

471
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,885
911, where's your emergency?

472
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,368
Hi. Someone's stuck in the
trunk of the car in front of me.

473
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,170
A red Camry. It may be a child.

474
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,763
Yo, I got her!
Okay, ma'am, what road are you on?

475
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,610
The 170, heading north.

476
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,962
Can you tell me
the license number on that car?

477
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,051
Can you do that?
It's 7CFI06X.

478
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,203
Casey, we're real close, honey.

479
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,725
Is it a stolen vehicle?
No, no.

480
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,402
Registration's for this white Ford
Explorer, so he switched plates.

481
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,841
- Switched plates.
- Hold on. I'm coming up to him.

482
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,048
I'll get a description.
No, no, no. Wait.

483
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,245
<i>Ma 'am, do not approach the vehicle.
This driver is suspected in a kidnapping.</i>

484
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,405
<i>Okay? Do not approach the vehicle.</i>
He's getting off.

485
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,443
- What exit?
- Fernando Boulevard.

486
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,810
All units, Camry spotted exiting the
170 northbound on Fernando Boulevard.

487
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,606
Northbound. Shit.
About face. Hold on.

488
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,928

00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,201
<i>And I'm really sorry.</i>

656
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,244
Please don't ever forget me.

657
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,886
That's all.

658
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,560
<i>That's all I wanted to say.</i>

659
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,771
Okay.

660
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,123
Okay, okay. Okay, sweetheart.

661
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,729
Casey.

662
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,889
You remember you told me
you were a fighter?

663
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:11,208
<i>Yes, we're fighters. We're Capricorns
and we're fighters, remember?</i>

664
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,521
Okay, so you know what we're gonna do
right now? We're gonna fight.

665
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,161
You and me, we're gonna fight, okay?

666
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,648
<i>We're gonna fight.</i>

667
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,683
Okay.
<i>Okay, good girl.</i>

668
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,128
Now, what I need you to do is go in
that man's pockets and get his wallet.

669
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,886
No. No.

670
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,323
I need you to get his wallet
and tell me what his name is, Casey.

671
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,965
<i>I need to know who that man is.</i>

672
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,488
<i>In order for me to find you,
I have to know who this man is.</i>

673
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,163
I need to know his name
as fast as you can, sweetheart.

674
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,330
<i>Come on, honey, do it. You can do it.</i>

675
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,848
His name is Alan Denado.

676
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,483
Good girl. You are a rock star, Casey.

677
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,801
<i>Good girl.</i>

678
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,842
All units, kidnap in progress,
female abducted at Fashion Plaza Mall.

679
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,364
P.R. is still online but in a different trunk.
Black Lincoln Town Car, owner-operated.

680
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,122
<i>License 6-Queen-Young-Union-0-1-7.</i>

681
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,485
<i>P. R. is on a disposable phone.
BCC is pinging the phone</i>

682
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,001
<i>but just getting single hits
off cell towers.</i>

683
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,528
<i>Last ping was off the tower of
San Fernando Valley and Sun/and.</i>

684
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,200
Five-mile radius,
unknown direction of travel.

685
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,007
Check to see if he has OnStar.
Just did. He doesn't.

686
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,009
Thirty unleaded. I'll pump it myself.
Sure.

687
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,170
We're at a gas station.

688
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,322
<i>Can you hear anybody, Casey?</i>

689
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,683
No, no, there's just music.

690
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,167
Okay.

691
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,966
Go ahead, you're good.
Check your fluids?

692
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,281
That's all right.

693
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,522
It won't take long.
I'm sure.

694
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,206
<i>Casey?</i>

695
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,050
<i>Casey?</i>

696
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,611
Casey, what's happening,
sweetheart?

697
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,649
I think I have an idea.

698
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,806
You don't have to do that.
No problem for me.

699
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,331
Don't need it.

700
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,530
Sure.

701
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,809
Come on, come OH, come on.

702
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,890
Help! Help, please! Please!

703
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,960
Please, I've been kidnapped!
Please help me!

704
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,891
Shit.
Please help me! Please!

705
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,525
<i>Please help! Please!</i>

706
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,041
Please help me! Please, please!

707
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,244
Please! Please!
Open the door now!

708
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,250
Please! Please help! Please! Please!

709
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,761
Stay back.

710
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,170
Back!

711
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,284
Please!
Stay back!

712
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,887
No! No! Aah!

713
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,123
No!

714
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,402
Oh, my... No, no, no!

715
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,642
No!
You stupid...

716
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,285
Come here.
No. No.

717
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,529
Get off me! No, you...
You just keep killing people.

718
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,491
Aah! You motherfucker!

719
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,125
That's him.

720
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:27,009
That is him.
Adam-16, we got a hit on that print.

721
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,607
Suspect is a Michael Lewis Foster.

722
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,843
<i>Record's clean on this guy,
no convictions except for...</i>

723
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,449
He was booked for arson back in '95
but he was cleared. That's our guy.

724
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,926
Got him. He's 36, 6'1", 182 pounds.

725
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,805
Current address,
451 Shannon Court.

726
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,691
Police. Don't move.
Oh! Oh!

727
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,121
Is Michael Foster in this house?

728
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,130
- Ma'am, are you his wife?
- Upstairs is clear.

729
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,890
Talk to me!
Yes, I am his wife.

730
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,764
Where is your husband?
What is this?

731
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,446
What the hell is...?
Tell me where he is.

732
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,007
Listen to me.
We need your help and it's urgent.

733
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,650
Where is your husband?
Working.

734
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,929
Where? Where does he work?
Downtown. Brent Vista Medical Center.

735
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,481
He's a med tech.
What time did he leave?

736
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,004
Phillips. Phillips.
What the hell is this about?

737
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,047
Ma'am, you're not gonna wanna
hear this in front of your kids.

738
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,522
Flora just got an assault.
Burn victim.

739
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,166
Guy doused an attendant
at a gas station. Lit him up.

740
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,051
Witnesses say the guy drove off
in a car. Guess what make.

741
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,762
Black Lincoln. Get the gas station
address and go tell Jordan.

742
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,166
This is Foster's office. Check it out.

743
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,883
I thought that girl
kind of looked like our P.R.

744
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,124
<i>8-Adam-16, we got a witness
puts suspect heading north</i>

745
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,124
<i>on Sierra.
That's eight miles north of you.</i>

746
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,641
Yeah, roger, he's not here.

747
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,968
Adam-8-16, go to tac 43 please.

748
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,010
Rog, tac 43.

749
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,369
<i>I still have the P. R. on the line
but she's not responding.</i>

750
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,006
You got anything for me, Paul?

751
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,571
I don't know yet.

752
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,531
Please. Please. Please.

753
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,206
Jordan. Jordan. Jordan!
Shit.

754
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,365
<i>I'm here, Jordan.</i>
Casey.

755
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,244
<i>Shut up!</i>

756
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,001
Shit. Shh. Shh. Shh.
Please let me go.

757
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,168
Shut up.

758
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,081
<i>No.</i>

759
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,248
Michael.

760
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,561
The police know who you are,
Michael Foster.

761
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,645
And they're at your house right now
with your family.

762
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,203
Who is this?

763
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,811
This is 911 emergency services.

764
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,771
And we've got your prints
at the scene of a murder.

765
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,889
<i>The only choice you have now
is to turn yourself in.</i>

766
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,047
<i>No, please.</i>

767
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,244
Michael, listen to me.

768
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,121
Do not hurt that little girl.

769
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,844
Do not hurt that little girl.
Let her go.

770
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,050
You don't have to do this.

771
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,925
<i>It's already done.</i>

772
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,447
<i>No. No. No! No!</i>

773
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,051
It's already done.

774
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,040
The signal died. We just lost him.

775
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,843
Michael Foster is the same man
that killed Leah Templeton.

776
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,405
Jordan.
It's the same man.

777
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,081
Jordan.
It's the same man.

778
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,242
<i>Adam-16, we lost the trace.</i>

779
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,762
But the last ping was off the tower
in Santa Clarita Hills.

780
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,490
Tell me where
he may have taken her.

781
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,441
There is no place because Michael
wouldn't do something like that.

782
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,483
Where's this house?
You have no right.

783
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,087
I have a right to arrest
you for obstruction.

784
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,362
Where is the house?

785
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,486
- That's where Michael grew up.
- But where is it?

786
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,723
It's gone. It's gone.
It burned down years ago.

787
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,686
Burned down?
Okay, what about this cottage?

788
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,850
The red one behind the house.
It's ours.

789
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,850
What do you mean, it's yours?
You still own it?

790
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,368
Yes, we own it.
Michael's been renovating it.

791
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,681
Ma'am, a girl may die if you don't help.

792
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,167
You understand?
You don't want that.

793
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,687
Tell us where it is.
Just tell us where it is.

794
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,642
8-Adam-16, I need to run a plate.
1-Mary-2-5-8-Lincoln-9.

795
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,645
We got an old
registration for Melinda Foster.

796
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,490
Old registration. Deceased.

797
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:44,891
Address, 1765 Oakcreek Lane.
In the Santa Clarita Hills.

798
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,929
Supervisor at Brent Vista
says he left before noon.

799
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,288
8-Adam-16,
contact the watch commander.

800
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,807
We're gonna need backup units
and an airship.

801
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,169
Roger on that. It's on the way.
Go to tac 41, please.

802
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,964
Yeah, roger, tac 41.

803
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,321
<i>Paul?</i>
Yeah?

804
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:06,320
Foster, that's the same guy
that killed Leah Templeton.

805
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,447
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.

806
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,287
Be careful.

807
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,410
L.A.P.D. We're coming in!

808
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,329
<i>- Spread out.</i>
<i>- Room clear.</i>

809
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,486
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

810
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,091
Clear here.

811
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,521
<i>- Nothing.</i>
<i>- Outside, west wall,</i>

812
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,081
<i>covered. Back here.</i>

813
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,563
8-Adam-16, it's empty.

814
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,808
No sign of Foster
or the girl or the Lincoln.

815
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,803
<i>This place is a dead end.</i>

816
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,685
Either he figured we were onto him
and he never showed,

817
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,410
or he's taken her somewhere.

818
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,329
<i>Let's clear out of here.</i>

819
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,650
<i>I want barricades on all incoming roads
within five miles of the cell tower.</i>

820
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,165
I know. I said his name, scared him off.
No, that's not true.

821
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,647
He found the cell
and he would have disconnected.

822
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,525
He was on his way there, Maddy.
The trace confirmed it.

823
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,404
That's not what happened.
Yeah.

824
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,728
No, it isn't. We had a trace going,

825
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,404
and you did every single thing exactly
the way you were supposed to do it.

826
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,887
I want you to go home.
Oh, I'm not going home.

827
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,690
This isn't a request.

828
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,567
You want closure.
You're not gonna get it.

829
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,366
You did your part,
now you let them do their part.

830
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,530
She's no longer your responsibility.
So I want you to go home,

831
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,206
and I want you
to take care of yourself.

832
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,610
Please. Please.

833
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,926
Oh, you're not gonna wanna see that.

834
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,921
No. No.

835
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,804
I told you
you didn't wanna see it.

836
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,686
<i>You promise you're gonna find me?</i>

837
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,569
<i>I can promise you
this, sweetheart, okay...</i>

838
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,809
<i>...Age, Casey. Twenties, 30s, 40s?</i>

839
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,129
<i>Thirties, I think. Like mid-30s.</i>

840
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,047
<i>- Bridesmaids.
- Are you kidding me?</i>

841
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:29,050
<i>I love that movie.
I think I saw it about...</i>

842
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,969
<i>You told me that.</i>

843
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,367
<i>Okay, so you know
what we're gonna do right now?</i>

844
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,010
<i>We're gonna fight.</i>

845
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,521
<i>You and me, we 're gonna fight.</i>

846
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,524
<i>Michael, listen to me.</i>

847
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,204
<i>Do not hurt that little girl.</i>

848
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,168
<i>Do not hurt that little girl. Let her go.</i>

849
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,087
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>

850
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,602
<i>It's already done.</i>

851
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,642
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>

852
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:10,766
<i>It's al...</i>

853
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,961
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>

854
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,608
<i>It's already done.</i>

855
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,242
<i>It's already done.</i>

856
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,642
<i>It's already done.</i>

857
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,444
<i>No, no. No!</i>

858
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,606
Check each and
every car twice. Twice.

859
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,247
Double check, triple check.
He's not getting through this point.

860
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,241
He is not getting through here.
Help them look.

861
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,443
Phillips.
Hey. You got anything?

862
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,246
No, not yet. Where are you?

863
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,486
Where else?

864
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,290
<i>You're still at the Hive.</i>

865
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,482
Jordan. Listen to me, okay?

866
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,564
We will find her, all right?
And we'll find her alive.

867
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,331
<i>All right, now you go home
and get you some rest.</i>

868
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,082
And, hey, you were an all-star tonight.

869
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,805
You really were, okay?

870
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,847
Paul.

871
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,646
<i>Listen, I'll call you
as soon as we get a lead.</i>

872
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,887
Thank you.

873
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,603
Call you later.

874
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,528
Move it up! Move it up! Move it up!

875
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,242
<i>You have arrived at your destination.</i>

876
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,001
<i>Your route guidance is now finished.</i>

877
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

878
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,728
Hi.

879
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,005
No.

880
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,370
No.

881
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,164
No. No.

882
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,522
No! No!

883
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:01,326
No! No!

884
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

885
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,725
Hey, Jordan.

886
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,321
Hey, we found the Lincoln.

887
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,807
He ditched it in the woods.

888
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,886
Denado's body was inside,
but there was, uh...

889
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,043
There was no sign of the girl.

890
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,481
Call me when you get this.

891
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,768
Please, just kill me.

892
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,962
Kill me, please.

893
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:19,926
Please, just kill me. Just kill me.

894
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,489
Why won't you just kill me?

895
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,847
Hair needs a healthy blood flow.

896
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,565
If you're dead...

897
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,688
No, please stop, please.

898
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,245
Then it dies too.

899
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,727
Stop, please.

900
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,005
I'm sorry, but I can't.

901
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I can't.
I can't stop.

902
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,645
Oh... Oh, God.

903
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:20,011
Oh... Okay, it's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay.

904
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,290
Don't worry, okay?

905
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,889
Who are you?

906
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,163
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

907
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,283
Jordan?
Yeah.

908
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,285
Yeah.

909
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,165
It's Jordan.
I'm gonna get you out of here. Okay?

910
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,085
Trash!

911
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:35,880
Aah! Shit!

912
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,491
Go! Go!

913
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,924
Trash!

914
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,124
Go, go!

915
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,529
Go, go. Go! Go, go.

916
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,128
Oh, my God.

917
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,364
Wait.

918
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,764
You should have
listened to me, Michael Foster.

919
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:39,408
You could have turned yourself in
when you had the chance.

920
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,490
Oh.

921
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:47,566
You're the operator.

922
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,006
Thought you'd be taller.

923
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,082
So when do the police get here?

924
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,882
The police?

925
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,123
Yeah.

926
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,043
I escaped.

927
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,208
Jordan found me in the woods.

928
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,484
And you...

929
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:23,805
disappeared.

930
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,411
What?

931
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:31,203
Where do you think you're going, huh?
Where you going? Hey!

932
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:34,244
Hey! Unh! Wait!

933
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,801
Hey, where you think
you're going, you bitch?

934
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,444
You're just an operator.
You can't do this.

935
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,321
You can't.

936
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,766
It's already done.
No. Wait!

937
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,891
<i>911, where's your emergency?</i>
