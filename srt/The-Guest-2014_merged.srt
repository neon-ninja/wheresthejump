1
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,300
You done with your breakfast?

3
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,420
Yeah.

4
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,721
Let's do this thing.

5
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,051
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

6
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,449
- Drive safe.
- Bye, Mom.

7
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,444
- You got your lunch?
- Yeah.

8
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,681
Mrs. Peterson?

9
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,282
Yes. Can I, help you?

10
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,500
My name is David,
Mrs. Peterson.

11
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,780
I...

12
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,780
I knew your son Caleb.

13
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,100
We trained together and served together

14
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,051
and, well, we came to be good friends.

15
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,008
Would you like to come inside?

16
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,327
Thank you, ma'am.

17
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,489
So, are you sure I can't
get you anything?

18
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,765
Maybe just some water would be nice.

19
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,966
How did you get here?

20
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,380
I ran.

21
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,170
I needed the exercise.

22
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,289
From the bus station, I mean, in town.

23
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,220
You ran that whole way?

24
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,681
Yes, ma'am.

25
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,260
Here you go.

26
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,005
All right. Thank you, ma'am.

27
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,450
When did you get out?

28
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,420
Well, I was discharged on Wednesday

29
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,700
and I came straight here
from Fort Kennilworth.

30
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,764
You came straight here first thing?

31
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,405
Yeah. I wanted to come by sooner,
but I couldn't get leave.

32
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,081
Why?

33
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,260
Well, I was discharged
'cause I was wounded.

34
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,780
I was in a military hospital for a bit,

35
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,930
so it wasn't really the kind of
thing you could get leave from.

36
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,540
But don't worry, it was just
a bit of shrapnel in my back.

37
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,860
I'm right as rain now.

38
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,580
No, I meant, why did
you come here first thing?

39
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,580
Well, like I said, me and
your son Caleb, we were...

40
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,844
We were pretty close.

41
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,243
I was with him when he died.

42
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,420
- Really?
- Yes, ma'am.

43
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,011
And one of the things he asked
was for me to check on you all.

44
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,482
You and your whole family here.

45
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,725
He wanted me to tell
you that he loved you.

46
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,764
He specifically wanted me
to tell each one of you that

47
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,260
he loved you and he was thinking
of you guys up until the end.

48
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,042
I said I'd do that and so, here I am.

49
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,162
Would you excuse me, please?

50
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,641
That's me.

51
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,601
Right there.

52
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,685
Well, I'll be...

53
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,163
I remember that day.

54
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,007
It wasn't my intention
to upset you, ma'am.

55
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,564
I probably should have called first,

56
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,260
but I don't own a cell phone yet and,
I guess, I just wasn't thinking.

57
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,540
I'm going to be on my way now,

58
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,340
but I'd like it if we
could exchange e-mails...

59
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,687
Wait. No.

60
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,380
Anna, Caleb's sister, she works
nights, and she sleeps late.

61
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,682
And I know she would love to meet you.

62
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,362
Would you stay a little while longer?

63
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,220
Oh, you're not just saying
that to be polite now?

64
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,300
'Cause you don't need to be.

65
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,524
No, I'm not. Please, stay. It's...

66
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,620
It's nice having you here

67
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,402
and I would love to hear
more about you and Caleb.

68
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,610
Well, all right.

69
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,820
...Caleb and me, we figure that sounds,

70
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,500
more like a challenge
than anything else.

71
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,580
So, that night after he falls asleep,

72
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,620
we kind of crept over to his
cot with a tube of superglue.

73
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,940
Oh, no!

74
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,780
We didn't do anything too bad to him,

75
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,390
though, we could have, you know.

76
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,123
Hey, there you are. Anna, this is David.

77
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,780
Very nice to meet you.

78
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,860
Caleb told me a lot about you.

79
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,340
David just got discharged this week.

80
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,324
He was a friend of your brother's.

81
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,126
You knew Caleb?

82
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,760
Yes, ma'am.

83
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,606
"Yes, ma'am."

84
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,241
Okay.

85
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,404
So, where are you staying?

86
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,700
Well, I noticed a motel off the
highway on the way here...

87
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,820
No, no, no, no. You will stay
with us while you're here.

88
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,980
Oh, no. I couldn't put you all out.

89
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,420
Nonsense. We would love to have you.
We have plenty of room.

90
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,961
In fact, you can stay
in Caleb's old room.

91
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,966
We insist.

92
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,925
Well, I won't argue.

93
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,121
Just for tonight, though.

94
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,247
Well, I've got to head to the diner.

95
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,170
It was really great meeting you.

96
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,100
Likewise. Very nice meeting you.

97
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,660
- I guess I'll see you later.
- Bye.

98
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,202
Can I show you to your room?

99
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,521
Great.

100
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,660
There are clean towels in the bathroom

101
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,327
if you'd like to freshen up.

102
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,043
Mrs. Peterson, are you sure you're
comfortable with me staying in here?

103
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,500
Of course.

104
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,122
I mean, it's not like
it's going to any use.

105
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,482
I think it could be a good thing for us.

106
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,340
I'm gonna go and let you get settled in.

107
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,563
If you need anything, just holler.

108
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,689
Oh, my God!

109
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,060
Fucking pussy.

110
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,850
Oh, my God!

111
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,841
Oh, it's okay, little baby, don't cry.

112
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,087
Hey, there.

113
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,460
How was your day?

114
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,500
It was good.

115
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,847
Great.

116
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,300
...giving him a chance,
it's that I don't like the idea of

117
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,660
some random guy off the
street being invited to stay

118
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,201
in my house with my family.

119
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,807
So, you knew my brother?

120
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,763
I did, pretty well, yeah.

121
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,004
He wanted me to tell
you that he loved you.

122
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,171
Oh. Thanks.

123
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,140
Even though he says he
was friends with Caleb.

124
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,140
He's in the photograph of Caleb's squad.

125
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,340
You saw the photograph.

126
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,460
- He was not a stranger.
- You know what?

127
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,020
What if he has the PTSD
or whatever it's called?

128
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,420
Some of these guys come back with
mental health problems, Laura.

129
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,860
Did you take that into account?

130
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,810
What if Caleb had come back different?

131
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,490
Did you take that into account?

132
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,168
Wow, that is...

133
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,929
Your parents are fighting about me.

134
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,162
Yeah. They argue a lot.

135
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,442
You look like you got hit or something.

136
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,482
Yeah, yeah, I got hit with
a football in gym class.

137
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,570
Yeah, that can happen.

138
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,500
Yeah.

139
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,121
No, no, you're right,
you're right. Let's talk to him.

140
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,290
Hi, great, okay.

141
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,740
David, we're very happy
to have you here.

142
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,580
I'm gonna have a beer before dinner.
Can I offer you one?

143
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,220
- Well, no, thank you.
- No. Okay. Suit yourself.

144
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,020
And dinner is gonna be ready in an hour.

145
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,482
So, Luke, why don't
you do some homework.

146
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,380
Okay.

147
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,660
David, can I get you anything?

148
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,247
Oh, no, thank you,
Mrs. Peterson, I'm fine.

149
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,166
Yeah, hit this.

150
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,260
Look out... Shit.

151
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,580
No...

152
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,364
- Now?
- No, I'm good, but thank you.

153
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,801
So, that friend of your brother's,
is he sticking around?

154
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,900
I don't know. I hope not.

155
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,884
Why? You said you liked him.

156
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,851
I said he seemed nice.
That's not the same thing.

157
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,561
Oh, okay.

158
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,411
Why don't you like him?

159
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,730
I don't not like him.

160
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,166
It's just, I...

161
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,243
I mean, you kind of knew Caleb.

162
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,440
We've all...

163
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,886
I just know Mom and Dad
have been trying to move on

164
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,940
and it's not like they don't have
enough reminders in this town.

165
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,241
Yeah.

166
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,220
I don't know,
that seems pretty normal to me.

167
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,966
You know, like, your kid dies.
That's hard.

168
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,444
Yeah.

169
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,700
Guess we just don't need a walking,
breathing reminder

170
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,740
of him right now, you know?

171
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,286
Yeah. Totally.

172
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,804
I've got to go.

173
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,340
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second.

174
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,580
- Stop. I can't...
- What!

175
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,860
No, no. Let's just hang out,
like, a little bit longer.

176
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,140
- I can't.
- Just a little bit longer.

177
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,460
I can't. I have to go.

178
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,569
- You don't have to go.
- Yes, I do.

179
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,220
But I'm sure we can find some
time at Kristen's tomorrow, okay?

180
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,485
Stop, I have to go.

181
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,020
The sine is the angle of
the ship's anchor cable,

182
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,820
so the cable is the hypotenuse,
and what we need to find out

183
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,043
is the distance down
to the ocean bottom,

184
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,126
so that's the opposite. Do you see?

185
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,540
Not really.

186
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,805
So, you're kind of smart?

187
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,685
I guess so.

188
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,044
Hey, how was work?

189
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,140
Good. Not too busy.

190
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,020
David, sure I can't get you a beer?

191
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,300
You know, I will have one. Thank you.

192
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,140
- I'll take one, too.
- Yeah, I'm sure you will.

193
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,500
I'm 21 in a month.

194
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,242
You can have all the beer you want then,
assuming you buy it yourself.

195
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,449
Are you helping him with his homework?

196
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,562
Well, not exactly.

197
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,766
Hey, don't go.
Stick around, be sociable.

198
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,208
I'm kind of tired.
I think I'm gonna lay down.

199
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,690
Okay. Suit yourself.

200
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,340
But Allan, his name's Allan,
he's only been there for, what,

201
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,060
like, four years, but he's got a degree,

202
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,002
so, boom, suddenly he's
regional manager and I'm not.

203
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,682
And that's okay. I mean, it's okay.

204
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,700
But I know Laura, I know she's worried.

205
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,567
She wonders if I'm ever,
ever going to make any money.

206
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,842
Your wife seems to respect you, sir.

207
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,161
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

208
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,443
It is what it is, you know.

209
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,763
What about you, though?
What about you? What are your plans?

210
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,020
Figured I'd get on a bus tomorrow,
head down to Florida or something

211
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,100
and start looking for work.

212
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,380
I've done construction work before.

213
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,260
So, I'm sure I'll find something.

214
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,564
No, no, no, no, no. That's crazy.

215
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,180
That's crazy. You don't
know where you're going.

216
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,820
Stay here for a couple more days.

217
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,900
No. No, I can't.

218
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,820
I couldn't impose on your
hospitality any longer, sir.

219
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,140
You're not... Impose on our...

220
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,980
And "sir"? You're calling me "sir" now?

221
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,180
You gotta stop with the "sir,"
my name's Spencer.

222
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,220
You gotta call me Spencer,
for God sakes.

223
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,420
- Okay.
- Okay.

224
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,780
- All right.
- Okay.

225
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,580
So you're sticking around, right?

226
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,460
You stick around at least till
you know where you're going.

227
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,620
Well, maybe just a couple
more days, all right.

228
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,446
Cool, excellent. It's a deal.

229
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,500
Let's have a couple more
of these to celebrate,

230
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,540
and then I've got to get off to bed.

231
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,490
God, you can put your liquor away.

232
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,531
I guess so.

233
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,445
I'm tired. Are you tired?

234
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,650
No, I don't need much sleep.

235
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,409
What are you doing here?

236
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,005
I told your mom I could pick
you up from school today.

237
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,900
That cool?

238
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,326
Yeah.

239
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,803
Don't you, like, have any friends?

240
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,249
I have lots of friends.

241
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,484
Just not, like, here. Like, online.

242
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,411
What are you waiting for?

243
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,087
I want you to show me
who hit you yesterday.

244
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,090
I got hit with a football.

245
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,806
Yeah.

246
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,451
What are you going to do?

247
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,807
Nothing bad.

248
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,287
Over there.

249
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,460
All of them?

250
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,081
Well, most of them give me a hard time.

251
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,620
Those two guys,
Mike and Ian, are the worst.

252
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,809
Those guys are real assholes.

253
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,771
Can we go now?

254
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,687
Yes.

255
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,487
What are you doing?

256
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,565
They're going to a bar?

257
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,300
Yeah,

258
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,807
this place will serve you if
you're on the football team.

259
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,807
Well, I could use a drink.

260
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,487
How about you?

261
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,201
No.

262
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,891
You coming?

263
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,764
No.

264
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,207
Well, I'll be inside if
you change your mind.

265
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,169
What the fuck?

266
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,441
Hey, Luke.

267
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,060
Maybe it's his boyfriend or something?

268
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,526
Excuse me.

269
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,245
I'm gonna need to see some ID.

270
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,130
You ID all of them?

271
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,524
What can I get you?

272
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,660
Do you know how to make a fireball?

273
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,060
Cinnamon schnapps and Tabasco sauce.

274
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,940
That's my drink of choice.
Let me get one of those.

275
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,969
A Coke here for my brother,

276
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,620
and I can't help but notice

277
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,020
that those ladies over there
are drinking cheap beer.

278
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,300
That seems like a shame to me.

279
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,740
I'd like to buy each one
of them a blowjob shot.

280
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,290
- Are you serious?
- I am, yes.

281
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,250
Do you wanna buy
anything for their fellas?

282
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,620
Do I look like I'd like to buy
something for their fellas?

283
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,809
Might be the polite thing to do.

284
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,451
Sure, okay, fine.

285
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,420
I'm gonna get each one of
those guys a cosmopolitan.

286
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,580
Mister, I don't know
what you're going for,

287
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,500
but, I was thinking a beer.

288
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,500
No. Blowjob shots for the ladies,

289
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,882
and a cosmopolitan for each of the guys.

290
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,484
You keep the change on that.

291
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,327
You got it.

292
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,730
Are you, like, rich?

293
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,771
Cash is easy to get.

294
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,805
He doesn't need to be in costume
to make an ass out of himself.

295
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,846
Here's your Coke, here's your fireball.

296
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,180
Got their shots and
cosmos coming right up.

297
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,481
Thank you.

298
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,326
You want to try it?

299
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,841
Sure.

300
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,887
God!

301
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,246
It's like hot peppers.

302
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,967
You drink that?

303
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,166
Yep.

304
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,886
How do you do that?

305
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,846
You get used to it.

306
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,580
From that table over there.

307
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,041
That fucking guy?

308
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,210
They look annoyed.

309
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,721
Yep.

310
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,166
Thanks for the drink.

311
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,580
You're welcome.

312
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,842
I don't want it, though.
You can have it.

313
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,130
Well, maybe you prefer this.

314
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,770
My eyes!

315
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,500
Hey, you...

316
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,200
Hey, Luke.

317
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,041
Luke.

318
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,881
Cool.

319
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,651
You guys should get out of here.

320
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,650
Call the police and tell them the truth.

321
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,180
A gang of high school kids came in here
and demanded you serve them drinks.

322
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,331
Well, you tried to ID them, but,
they threatened to cause trouble.

323
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,644
There was a fight.

324
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,300
You didn't really get a good
look at the other guys.

325
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,140
Otherwise, I imagine you and this place

326
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,700
could get into trouble
for serving minors.

327
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,545
I mean, this is what happens.

328
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,841
Here.

329
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,325
For the damages.

330
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,620
Luke! What happened?

331
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,140
I got into a fight with
some guys at school.

332
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,900
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

333
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,780
Some seniors were picking on me.
It's no big deal.

334
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,900
Why were they picking on you?

335
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,680
I don't know, okay. I'm just going
to go to my room, all right.

336
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,660
Is he all right?

337
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,220
Yes, ma'am, he's fine.

338
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,940
Did he get in trouble at the school?

339
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,687
No, no one saw. It's just the
usual high school stuff, you know.

340
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,380
I told him I'd teach him some
self-defense when he's feeling up to it.

341
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,284
I'm sure that's exactly what he needs.

342
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,122
Well, I am very relieved
that you were there.

343
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,100
I'm going to get ready for Kristen's.

344
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,780
Anna, can we talk in the kitchen?

345
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,081
Sure.

346
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,761
Excuse us.

347
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,481
What?

348
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,403
Invite him to the party.

349
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,580
- Why?
- 'Cause he's lonely, sweetie.

350
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,140
Caleb would really love that.

351
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,500
Really? You're going to pull that card?

352
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,131
Yes.

353
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,327
David, would you like to come
to the party with me tonight?

354
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,325
Sure, that sounds nice.

355
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,526
Great. I'm going to leave around 7:00.

356
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,365
All right.

357
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,846
Luke, I need to take a shower.

358
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,761
Luke!

359
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,245
Luke, come on, I need to...

360
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,286
I'm sorry...

361
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,500
No, I'm sorry,

362
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,609
I thought Luke was in there.

363
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,724
Oh, I guess I better go get dressed.

364
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,180
Yeah, yeah.

365
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,323
You should, probably do that.

366
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,540
So, this isn't a big deal or anything,
but this isn't just Kristen's place.

367
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,002
My boyfriend, Zeke, lives here, too.

368
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,129
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

369
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,660
Yeah, well, neither do my parents.

370
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,740
And I wouldn't mind keeping it
that way, if that's cool with you.

371
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,405
I won't say anything.

372
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,729
It's none of my business.

373
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,243
- Hi.
- Hey.

374
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,410
Hey, who's this?

375
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,460
This is David, he was
friends with my brother Caleb.

376
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,330
- I told you about him.
- How do you do?

377
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,325
Fine, thank you.

378
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,725
Zeke's inside smoking. He was
waiting for help to carry the kegs.

379
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,885
I'll bring them in.

380
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,121
Where are they?

381
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,766
They're in Zeke's van.
It should be unlocked.

382
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,601
Anna?

383
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,180
No. I can't tonight. I wish.

384
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,380
What? Really?

385
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,060
What? Your houseguest?

386
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,260
Yeah, he's...

387
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,130
Where do you want these?

388
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,649
Well, you can set them right here.

389
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,060
My man, welcome to the party.

390
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,340
Craig, no.

391
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,324
It's fine. He's a big boy.

392
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,841
Sure.

393
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,601
Thanks.

394
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,166
Thank you.

395
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,121
Excuse me.

396
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,121
Thank you.

397
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,820
You all right?

398
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,485
Yeah, I'm fine.

399
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,321
You wanna...

400
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,400
Yeah, let's go.

401
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,171
God damn it.

402
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,846
Who are they?

403
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,851
No. That's my ex. The one I
was just telling you about.

404
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,842
Hey, I need to talk to you.

405
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,130
I'm busy right now, Drew.

406
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,700
I've been calling you all week,

407
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,220
and then I hear you're
having a party tonight?

408
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,601
What the fuck?

409
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,220
I'm talking to my friend.
You're being rude.

410
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,681
All right, listen, just...

411
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,681
Come here...

412
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,886
Motherfucker!

413
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,529
Get him out of here.

414
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,525
Sorry about your picture.

415
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,521
No, don't worry about it.

416
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,401
Did you...

417
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,606
Did you want to see
the rest of the house?

418
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,445
Are you okay?

419
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,611
Yeah. Why?

420
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,251
Seems like you're not really into this.

421
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,847
Oh, I am.

422
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,131
You are.

423
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,650
Hey, there they are.

424
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,207
Who have you got?
I got a queen. He's got a king.

425
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,500
Sit down.

426
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,168
Thought you guys left your own party,
found something better.

427
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,327
- Want some?
- No, I'm good.

428
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,129
I just...

429
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,004
I wanted to say we support you guys.

430
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,846
If you need anything,
you just let me know.

431
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,884
Support us how?

432
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,340
I mean, you know, we support you,
like, "Go America!" right?

433
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,042
But you wouldn't support
us by, like, enlisting?

434
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,180
Shit, man, they don't want me in there.

435
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,580
No, I can't, you know.

436
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,060
I've got bad asthma.

437
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,220
It'd make it real hard to...

438
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,601
Hard to what?

439
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,486
Hey, man, I mean, I just...

440
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,060
What?

441
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,010
I'm just fucking with you, man.

442
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,089
Fuck, man.

443
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,060
Oh, you think that's funny, Kristen?

444
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,850
I'll be right back.

445
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,683
Nice piece of ass there?

446
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,522
Could you get me a gun?

447
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,891
A gun?

448
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,340
Yeah, I can get you a gun.

449
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,051
What do you need a gun for?

450
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,780
I'm a soldier, man. I like guns.

451
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,340
Yeah. I know a guy.

452
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,780
You got cash?

453
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,241
I do.

454
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,129
Fuck it. Give me your number.

455
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,180
I'm using a burner right now.

456
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,561
Number's on the back.

457
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,408
Soldiers like guns.

458
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,060
Landing a gig is huge for me.

459
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,620
What's the big deal if I go on tour?

460
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,260
It's, like, three weeks, max.

461
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,900
Why don't you trust me for,
like, five seconds?

462
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,964
I don't know. Maybe...

463
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,811
- I've given you no reason not to trust me.
- I'm done with this.

464
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,201
Come on.

465
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,761
- You ready to go?
- Sure.

466
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,447
- I'll drive.
- No, I'm fine.

467
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,020
I'll drive.

468
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,651
You're stoned.

469
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,522
And how are you more sober than me?

470
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,650
I'm bigger than you.

471
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,330
Please, put on your seat belt.

472
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,889
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No.

473
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,100
It's just...

474
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,321
It's nothing. I mean,
we got into an argument.

475
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,580
It's old stuff.

476
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,369
You know, I used to love
that he was in a band.

477
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,500
But now I'm saving money for college,

478
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,540
and he just isn't moving on.

479
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,410
I mean, he doesn't even have a job.

480
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,980
Well, he's a drug dealer.

481
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,044
Okay. He's not a drug dealer.

482
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,883
Yeah. He sells drugs sometimes to,
like, friends for extra cash.

483
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,780
Well, if he's messing things
up with you, then he's a fool,

484
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,140
and you don't need to worry about it.

485
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,885
No. I'm serious.

486
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,245
I mean, hell, if I'd had a
girl like you back home,

487
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,929
I wouldn't have gone over to
the Middle East to get shot at.

488
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,086
Thank you.

489
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,044
I like this music.

490
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,580
You do?

491
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,161
It's, just a mix that I made.

492
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,123
I can make you one if you wanted.

493
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Yeah? Can you put this song on it?

494
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,609
Yeah, I can do that.

495
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,361
So, good night.

496
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,961
Good night.

497
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,645
Thanks for inviting me out.

498
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,965
Yeah, no problem.

499
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,001
Good night.

500
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,300
No. I want to proceed as we discussed.

501
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,080
No one will be able to recognize me.
That's important.

502
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,849
What do you mean, "Dental records"?

503
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,300
An orthodontist? No, I don't need that.

504
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,284
Fingers, yes.

505
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,380
As soon as possible.
I'm off the grid for now.

506
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,887
But there are people
trying to look for me.

507
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,280
I understand it'll take some time,
but this is urgent.

508
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,090
I just need a new face.

509
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,740
I'll keep this phone in case anything
comes up and you need to reach me.

510
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,644
All right. Copy that.

511
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,120
Yeah, his name is David
Andersen Collins.

512
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,405
I can tell you the unit that
he served in if that helps.

513
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,740
No, nothing's wrong.

514
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,771
He was friends with my brother
and we heard that he was back,

515
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,362
so, any contact
information would be great.

516
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,561
Okay, ma'am. I'll call you
when we have any details.

517
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,401
Goodbye.

518
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,540
Tell Fort Kennilworth that
David Collins is dead.

519
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,205
Just give them the official version.

520
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,324
We'll take it from here.

521
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,020
Next week I'm meeting
with the rest of the board

522
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,060
to discuss the future of our
work with the military,

523
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,966
in light of Project
Aegolius' dissolution.

524
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,802
Richard has more information
on that subject. Richard?

525
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,161
I can't get into too many details,
nor would you want me to.

526
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,845
However, I can say that...

527
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,200
Sorry to interrupt. Something's come up.

528
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,122
My apologies, but you'll
have to excuse me.

529
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,300
When did Fort Kennilworth
receive this call?

530
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,540
About an hour ago, sir.

531
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,740
Have you ID'd the caller?

532
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,283
Not confirmed, but she gave
her name as Anna Peterson.

533
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,740
Peterson.

534
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,220
As in Caleb Peterson?

535
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,780
His sister.

536
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,340
Home address is in there.

537
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,660
Book me on the next flight.

538
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,980
If we need to charter something, do it.

539
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,884
And I'm gonna need some shooters.

540
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,404
If anyone asks what's happening,
what do I tell them?

541
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,405
Make something up.

542
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,020
No one outside this circle can know
that any of our subjects are still active.

543
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,740
If KPG gets any blowback on this,

544
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,740
you and I will both be hung out to dry.

545
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,371
You got that?

546
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,722
Call me when you got the plane booked.

547
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,090
I'm not late, am I?

548
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,528
No, no. You're just on time.

549
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,300
Good.

550
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,380
Look, before we get started,

551
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,900
I just want to make sure that
you've got some cash on you.

552
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,565
No offense.

553
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,680
That should be good?

554
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,961
It'll do.

555
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,006
Let's get started.

556
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,700
Let's start with this.

557
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,660
I mean, it's a standard Beretta.
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

558
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,123
In my opinion, if you've seen one
of these, you've seen them all.

559
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,380
But this baby, this here is

560
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,620
a 9-millimeter Witness Elite.

561
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,740
It's a very similar weapon to
the Beretta, but I prefer the recoil.

562
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,804
I mean, it's got
absolutely no kick at all.

563
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,801
You army?

564
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,401
Yes, sir.

565
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,809
I'm navy, myself.

566
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,400
Yeah, that's fine.

567
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,340
You want the Elite?

568
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,051
Oh, I'll take 'em all.

569
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,340
All the handguns?

570
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,610
No. Everything. All your guns.

571
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,321
Shit.

572
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,060
That's what I was thinking.

573
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,060
Look, man, if you've brought
money for all of them,

574
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,820
I'll cut you a deal.
You can take 'em all off my hands.

575
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,531
No, I'm going to kill you.

576
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,540
Hey, what the fuck, David?

577
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,460
Now, you listen to me
one fucking second...

578
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,900
Wait, wait, wait.

579
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,100
No, no, no, no.

580
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,401
Hello?

581
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,770
Yeah, thanks for calling me back.

582
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,886
What?

583
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,540
Hey, Mom, can I talk
to you for a second?

584
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,207
Sure, sweetie, what's going on?

585
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,580
I called the army base

586
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,087
that David said that he
was just discharged from,

587
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,620
I wanted to ask about him.

588
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,730
What? Why would you do that?

589
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,561
Spencer?

590
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,740
I need a drink.

591
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,281
- Why? What happened?
- I'm getting a drink, honey.

592
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,300
They found Allan,
you know my boss, Allan?

593
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,460
He'd been missing from
work for a couple of days,

594
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,820
everybody got very worried,

595
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,860
so one of his friends went
over and broke into his house.

596
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,860
And they found him
and his girlfriend dead.

597
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,500
They'd both taken a bunch
of prescription pills,

598
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,860
it was like they committed
suicide together or something.

599
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,500
Oh, my God!

600
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,980
But that doesn't make any sense.
He was...

601
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,780
No. The guy was totally normal.

602
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,651
But the police are investigating.
You know, it's...

603
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,540
Doesn't look like it was a break-in.

604
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,860
There was no forced entries.

605
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,288
She... The girl... She had...

606
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,010
She had bruises on her body.

607
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,721
I don't know what that means.

608
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,580
Anyway, we will leave it for the police

609
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,460
to tell us exactly what happened.

610
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,125
I don't know.

611
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,900
Damn thing is this makes
me regional manager.

612
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,420
Yeah. As soon as Corporate
found out, they called me.

613
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,180
Right away they want
me to start tomorrow.

614
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,220
And they're offering me Allan's salary.

615
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,885
So...

616
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,100
Well, that's...

617
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,890
Yeah.

618
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,600
Careful what you wish for.

619
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,361
David.

620
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,171
I'm sorry to interrupt.

621
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,811
No. Don't be silly. It's fine.

622
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,889
I'm having a drink.
Would you join me?

623
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,521
Oh, sure.

624
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,726
I'll be right back.

625
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,660
- Hello?
- Hey, Anna?

626
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,540
It's Craig, babe.
They just found him out at the quarry.

627
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,525
He's dead. Someone shot him.

628
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,247
What?

629
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,365
Do they know who did it?

630
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,728
I don't really have all the details yet.

631
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,300
Can you meet up later?

632
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,681
Yeah, of course.

633
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,242
There's something else I
need to talk to you about.

634
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,090
What is it?

635
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,500
Oh, shit. Fuck.

636
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,460
Babe, I got to go, all right.
I'll call you back.

637
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,841
Hello?

638
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,609
I just heard from Zeke.

639
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,481
How are you doing?

640
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,125
I just don't get it.

641
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,805
Who'd want to hurt Craig?

642
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,804
Yeah, I know. Can you
sit down for a second?

643
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,721
Yeah.

644
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,460
So, how does this work again?

645
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,603
First you make a hole at the top,

646
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,321
so you can reach in and
scoop all the guts out.

647
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,286
Oh, man.

648
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,020
Your parents' knives suck.

649
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,321
Yeah.

650
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,171
That's better.

651
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,163
Do you carry that with you,
like, all the time?

652
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,002
Oh, this thing? Sure.

653
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,326
Why?

654
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,851
I don't know.

655
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,640
Just in case.

656
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,171
I called the army base that
David said that he was from.

657
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,128
They told me that David
Collins died a week ago.

658
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,060
He was in some military
hospital in Arizona.

659
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,523
There was a fire from oxygen tanks.

660
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,050
About 20 people died,
David Collins was one of them.

661
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,682
Does David have any ID? Credit cards?

662
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,486
I've never seen him use a wallet.

663
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,890
What about his phone?
He has a burner, right?

664
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,740
Why don't you check some
of the numbers he's called?

665
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,060
Your brother knows computers.

666
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,980
Have him look some of them up.

667
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,460
Yeah. That's a good idea.

668
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,660
Hey, Kristen. I think that
couple's been done for a bit.

669
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,246
I've got it. Thanks.

670
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,530
Call me after work, okay?

671
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,089
- Take care of yourself.
- You, too.

672
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,243
Do you want some advice, Luke?

673
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,361
Sure.

674
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,009
Never let anyone pick on you.

675
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,440
Otherwise, you'll carry it with
you the rest of your life.

676
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,083
Those kids at school,
they're bigger than you?

677
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,420
Yeah.

678
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,449
Then bring a knife to school.

679
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,460
If they take it off of
you and beat you up,

680
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,860
you go around their houses at night

681
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,540
and burn them down with
their families inside.

682
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,365
What's the worst they can do?

683
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,489
Yeah. Okay.

684
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,441
Here. You keep it.

685
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,100
You're giving this to me?

686
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,140
Yeah, man, it's yours. I've got others.

687
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,441
Thanks.

688
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,811
Hey.

689
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,860
Mom and Dad around?

690
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,340
No. They went to the store.
Your mom's making pumpkin pie.

691
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,520
That's cool.

692
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,325
Shit.

693
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,200
Fuck!

694
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,281
Fuck.

695
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,685
Oh, my God!

696
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,161
Hello.

697
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,802
Hey, it's, me.

698
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,641
Hey.

699
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,241
What?

700
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,891
They found the gun that
killed Craig in your van?

701
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,100
Yeah, it was wiped clean.

702
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,562
I guess they just got an
anonymous tip or something.

703
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,450
But you're innocent!

704
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,260
Anna, I know, but,
then they searched my room,

705
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,220
and they found some
other stuff. You know.

706
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,046
So, it looks like I'm actually
gonna be here for a little while.

707
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,965
I love you, all right?

708
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,881
Yeah, I know. I gotta go.

709
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,765
Okay.

710
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,326
Love you, bye.

711
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,171
Honey, you okay?

712
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,601
I...

713
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,620
My friend Craig was killed today.

714
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,540
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

715
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,127
How? What happened?

716
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,209
He was shot. I don't know.

717
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,420
And they arrested Zeke for it.

718
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,820
- Zeke?
- I'm sorry, honey.

719
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,100
But if they arrested your ex-boyfriend,

720
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,129
it was probably for a very good reason.

721
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,780
We all know Zeke was never
exactly a pillar of this community.

722
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,500
He's not my ex-boyfriend,
Dad, he's my boyfriend.

723
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,740
I never stopped seeing him.

724
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,500
I'm 20 years old, I can date who I want.

725
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,940
As long as you live in
this house, you cannot.

726
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,060
Oh, you know nothing about him! Nothing!

727
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,460
- I know he's a drugged-out punk junkie...
- Really, Dad!

728
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,540
...who started dating my daughter

729
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,808
when she was 17 years old,
is what I know.

730
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,491
Right.

731
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,245
What about him?

732
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,643
Everybody's best friend.

733
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,500
I called the military base
that he said he was from

734
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,131
and they told me he was dead.

735
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,571
That's military intelligence for you.

736
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,251
Right. Ask to see his ID.

737
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,842
He's not David Collins, okay.
We don't know who he is.

738
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,940
I was part of a special forces
unit when I was injured,

739
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,020
so they should be
providing a cover story

740
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,700
if any civilians ask about me.

741
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,684
That's a good thing.

742
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,380
But I did get my dog tags back.

743
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,931
They're right here.

744
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,780
I don't like to wear them because...

745
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,606
Well, I don't know, but...

746
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,569
I like having them with me,
though, you know.

747
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,100
As for ID, I don't have
a current license,

748
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,609
but, I've got my documents
in my bag. Should I go...

749
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,400
No, no, no. That won't be necessary.

750
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,580
Anna Peterson,
you owe him an apology right now.

751
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,928
- No fucking way.
- You watch your mouth, young lady.

752
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,060
I am very sorry about your friend Craig.

753
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,850
That's a terrible thing that happened.

754
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,740
As far as it goes with Zeke
Hastings and his crew,

755
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,780
I have it on very good authority they're
nothing but a bunch of pot dealers.

756
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,900
You wanna know why Zeke
was arrested for murder?

757
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,202
Because he probably did it, that's why.

758
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,605
- Fuck you!
- SPENCER:

759
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,922
Hey, now, Anna.

760
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,500
I'm sorry, honey.
David, I'm terribly sorry.

761
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,327
No, that's okay.
She's... She's upset.

762
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,380
I probably should have explained

763
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,980
the, special forces thing earlier,

764
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:09,127
it's just, we're not really
supposed to talk about it.

765
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,329
No. I understand.

766
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,180
I could use a drink.
How about you, David?

767
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,971
Yes, please.

768
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,327
What?

769
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,001
Hey.

770
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,049
I just wanted to say...

771
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,563
I just wanted to say how
sorry I am about Craig.

772
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,608
He seemed like a really cool guy.

773
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:23,284
And Zeke getting arrested...
Again, I'm very sorry.

774
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,566
I know you don't need me
here at this stressful time.

775
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,205
I'm not helping, which is a shame,

776
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,660
because I promised Caleb I would do

777
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,042
anything I could to help your family.

778
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,580
But just so you know, I'll be
moving on in a couple of days.

779
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,406
So, you don't need to put up
with me much longer, okay?

780
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,166
Okay.

781
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,201
Okay.

782
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,845
Good.

783
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,565
What is this?

784
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,881
Is this the CD you made me?

785
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,081
Yeah.

786
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,285
Is it done?

787
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,401
Yeah.

788
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,570
Well, thank you.

789
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,485
I can't wait to listen to it.

790
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,980
I want every contractor
within a 100-mile radius.

791
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,260
And I don't care where they come from.

792
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,100
KPG, ex-military, whatever.

793
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,780
I'll need a team mobilized
by the time I land.

794
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,780
I'll give them the necessary
mission specs in person.

795
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,620
We can't risk a leak on this.

796
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,646
Good luck.

797
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,762
You took a picture of David's phone?

798
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,860
Yeah. I paid for a
reverse directory thing

799
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,500
to look the number up online.

800
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,740
It said it was this unlisted
landline of a doctor in Miami.

801
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,260
His name's Peter Boddington.

802
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,130
Except he's not a doctor anymore.

803
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,980
He lost his license two years ago

804
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,460
after performing a face lift on
a woman while he was drunk.

805
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,540
So, David knows the guy? I mean,
maybe it's his uncle or something.

806
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,380
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

807
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,060
I need to talk to the police.

808
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,020
The cops found those
drugs in Zeke's room,

809
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,940
so they think they've got their guy.

810
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,540
So, what do you need me to do?

811
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,730
Get any information you can on this guy.

812
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,008
Do you really think David
killed Craig and that other guy?

813
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,165
Yeah. I do.

814
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,163
Okay. I'll see if I can find anything.

815
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,404
Thank you, Luke.

816
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,488
I'm sorry. I'll show you some
magic tricks later. Just...

817
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,882
- Hey, faggot.
- Oh. Whoa.

818
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,340
Hey, what's that you're looking at?

819
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,086
Are you looking for someone to
do your sex change operation?

820
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:06,369
You little fucking bitch...

821
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,085
That's right, bitches.

822
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,403
God damn it.

823
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,580
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

824
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,620
- Mrs. Peterson?
- Yes, that's right.

825
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,900
Mr. Alston will see you now.
Please, step inside.

826
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,850
- Okay.
- Just a second.

827
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,281
What happened?

828
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,282
This kid called me a faggot,

829
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,900
so I,

830
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,168
broke a yardstick on his face.

831
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,841
Okay.

832
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,801
Awesome.

833
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,480
I'll go in with you.

834
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,161
Okay.

835
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,380
- Is it this way?
- Yes.

836
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,340
Due to our school's zero
tolerance policy on violence,

837
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,325
I'm afraid we have no choice
but to expel your son.

838
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,620
That's pending the
decision of the board,

839
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,729
but I'm afraid it's fairly certain.

840
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,685
- But...
- I'm sorry.

841
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,523
What did the kid call him?

842
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,961
What?

843
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,340
You know, the kid,
the one Luke hit in the face.

844
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,210
What did he call Luke?

845
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,460
I don't think that's relevant
to this conversation.

846
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,489
Did he call him a faggot?

847
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,740
I believe that's the word that
was used, yes. But that's no excuse...

848
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,963
So, that makes it a hate crime.

849
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,842
- What?
- A hate crime.

850
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,220
And I'd like to know how many others

851
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,444
have been perpetrated against
her son under your watch.

852
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,900
A gay student targeted with physical
violence finally defends himself,

853
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,850
and you're... What?

854
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,401
Suspending him?

855
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,580
We could consider suspension.

856
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,370
No. You couldn't.

857
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,300
I'll be interested to see
what the board makes of you

858
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,888
when this is in front of the entire country,
not to mention our lawyers.

859
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,020
Do you want to sue them?

860
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,180
I... I don't...

861
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,209
We're suing you and the school board.

862
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,764
I didn't even know he was gay.

863
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,609
What about after-school detention?

864
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,721
For how long?

865
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,647
A month.

866
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,686
That seems fair.

867
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,780
After-school detention.

868
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,140
We'll put him to work
helping the prom committee

869
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,930
set up for the Halloween dance.

870
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,331
We'll agree to that.

871
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,980
But I do not want to
hear anything further

872
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,700
about this young man being harassed.

873
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,240
We understand each other?

874
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,884
I believe we do, Mr...

875
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,100
Who are you?

876
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,765
I'm a friend of the family.

877
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,410
After-school detention for a month.

878
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,207
- That's it?
- Yeah.

879
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,242
- See you later.
- Oh, David?

880
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,286
Can I talk to you for a second?

881
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,340
I'm going to step out into the hall
with Luke for a moment, if that's okay.

882
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,766
Oh, certainly.

883
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,700
So, she thinks you killed Craig.

884
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,847
And she's trying to make a case to the
police so they'll let her boyfriend go.

885
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,409
- Anna told you all this?
- Yeah.

886
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,325
Do you think I killed Craig?

887
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,285
I don't care.

888
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,340
But that's why

889
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,500
she wanted me to check out
that plastic surgeon in Florida.

890
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,340
She wanted to know what
the connection was there.

891
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,300
Yeah, I mean, why would I
need a plastic surgeon, right?

892
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,886
To change your appearance.

893
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,209
Like, the bones in your face.

894
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,365
And maybe scar up your fingers
so you don't have prints.

895
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,247
I mean, at least that's what I figured.

896
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,580
I know you're not really David Collins,

897
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,020
I looked him up right
after Anna said that.

898
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,460
So, maybe you don't want
people to know who you are.

899
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,900
A doctor who would do that sort
of thing is probably pretty rare.

900
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,620
I mean, there's probably
rules against it.

901
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,820
But that doctor, well,
I guess he needs the money,

902
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,690
so he'd do that kind of work.

903
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,523
That's an interesting theory.

904
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,820
I'm not going to tell anyone about it.

905
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,380
And nobody will believe Anna.

906
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,409
She doesn't have anything against you.

907
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,848
You killed Dad's boss, too, right?

908
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,363
I don't care. I'm not
going say anything.

909
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,166
Why not?

910
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,929
Because we're friends.

911
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,841
Right?

912
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:12,089
Yeah. Of course we are.

913
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,526
Okay.

914
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,610
I just wanted you to know.

915
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,761
Did Anna tell anyone else about this?

916
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,691
I don't know.

917
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,491
Her friend, Kristen, maybe?

918
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,127
Okay.

919
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,921
Thank you.

920
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,762
You know, David, I really...

921
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,420
I wanna thank you.

922
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,300
I don't know what I would have
done if you hadn't been here.

923
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,140
And I don't... I don't
mean just for today,

924
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,220
I mean everything.

925
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,364
I am... I'm really grateful.

926
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,808
Really, Mrs. Peterson. It's no problem.

927
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,771
I'll go get the rest.

928
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,484
Thank you, David.

929
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,980
Excuse me, ma'am. Are you Anna Peterson?

930
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:09,700
No. No, she's working at the diner.

931
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,340
I'm her mother.

932
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,540
What's she... Did she do something?

933
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:14,820
No, it's fine, ma'am.

934
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,740
But your daughter,
she put in a call to Fort Kennilworth

935
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,380
a couple of days ago asking
about a man named David Collins.

936
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,523
Yes. Oh, that's right, she did.

937
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,886
You wouldn't happen to have seen
anyone resembling this man, would you?

938
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,007
This is... David.

939
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,168
Ma'am, when was the
last time you saw him.

940
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:42,409
Well, he just went inside.

941
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,700
No!

942
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,843
Stop the girl! Get back here.

943
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,127
Get him!

944
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,121
Oh, shit!

945
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,367
- No, no, no, no.
- David, what...

946
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,700
What is happening, David?

947
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,220
Who are those men?

948
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,500
I really am sorry about this,
Mrs. Peterson.

949
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,041
I'm afraid I haven't been
fully honest with you.

950
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,721
What do you mean?

951
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,824
It would take too long to explain.

952
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,580
I wanted to help.

953
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,121
I considered it my mission to
assist you all while I was here.

954
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,365
There were just too many complications.

955
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,260
What are you talking about?

956
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,325
David, why are those men
trying to kill you?

957
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,006
It doesn't matter.

958
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,371
Did you...

959
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:07,163
Did you even know my son?

960
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,486
I did.

961
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,486
Yes.

962
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,284
We were in the same program.

963
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:20,561
And he would understand
what I have to do here.

964
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,730
He's here in the...

965
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,765
I'm sorry.

966
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,980
I'm going in.

967
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,442
Give me 15 seconds of cover, then hold.

968
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,571
Fuck!

969
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,125
Fuck.

970
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,160
What the...

971
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,524
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

972
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,121
David.

973
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,808
I'm really sorry about this, sir.

974
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,685
I think he's dead.

975
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,860
Military police.
I'm gonna need your vehicle.

976
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:35,980
What?

977
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,964
- Are the keys in it?
- Yes, but...

978
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,650
Excuse me, are you Anna Peterson?

979
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,527
Yes.

980
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,100
My name is Major Carver.

981
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,368
Military police. I need you
to come with me, please.

982
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,220
Okay. What's going on?

983
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:12,020
It's about David, Miss Peterson.
He is not who you think he is.

984
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,810
And we need to go now.

985
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,641
Okay.

986
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,805
Is everything all right?

987
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:21,700
I think so. I'll call you later, okay?

988
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,740
Miss Peterson.

989
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,007
- Hey.
- Hey.

990
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,566
Is Anna working?

991
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,929
She just left.

992
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,441
Oh, yeah?

993
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,120
Where was she going?

994
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,340
I'm not sure exactly.

995
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,130
To pick up Luke?

996
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,500
I think that she's going...

997
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,801
Never mind.

998
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,806
What?

999
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,940
Okay. Copy. We're on our way.

1000
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,780
What?

1001
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,300
We're going to the rec
center to get your brother.

1002
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:22,166
The police couldn't send a car there.
They've got their hands full.

1003
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,447
Okay. You need to tell
me what's going on.

1004
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,245
Who are you?

1005
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:28,900
What? You came here for David?

1006
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,361
Yes.

1007
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,260
The soldier you know as David

1008
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,562
was one of the subjects
of a medical experiment.

1009
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,260
While we had him under study,
he killed several people and escaped.

1010
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,260
Then he burned their
bodies to confuse us.

1011
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,980
We thought he'd died
in the fire initially.

1012
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,660
By the time we figured out what
he'd done, the trail was cold.

1013
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,565
Maybe you shouldn't have tested
your procedures on a psychopath.

1014
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,962
By all accounts,
he was an ideal soldier.

1015
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,801
I don't know.

1016
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,570
I need to call my brother.

1017
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,087
Mr. Peterson, is that a cell phone?

1018
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,644
Didn't I say, "Phones off"?

1019
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,487
Hand it over.

1020
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,084
You can have it back after detention.

1021
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,620
Luke, I need you to call
me when you get this.

1022
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,251
Okay? It's important.

1023
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,249
Where are those cop cars going?

1024
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:36,241
Somebody attacked your
diner right after we left it.

1025
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,809
It was called in as an explosion.

1026
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,969
Is anyone alive?

1027
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,441
I don't know.

1028
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,804
It's possible that he'd leave
some wounded to keep them busy.

1029
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,129
Wait. Where are my parents?

1030
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,928
You haven't said anything
about my parents.

1031
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,325
They're both dead.

1032
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,249
He killed them before we could stop him.

1033
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,885
I'm sorry.

1034
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,165
No.

1035
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,940
David has neurological conditioning,
Miss Peterson,

1036
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,846
designed to protect both
him and the experiment.

1037
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,046
If he feels like his
identity may be compromised,

1038
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,881
he's programmed to
clean up all loose ends.

1039
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,809
I doubt he could stop himself
now even if he wanted to.

1040
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,210
It's why we need to get you and
your brother somewhere safe.

1041
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,249
Miss Peterson, we need to go.

1042
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,921
Miss Peterson?

1043
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,580
Yeah, let's go get my brother.

1044
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:33,980
What the hell is this?

1045
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,006
For the fall dance, they do
this Halloween maze thing.

1046
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,564
Stay close to me.

1047
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

1048
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,020
God damn it! What in the hell?

1049
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,890
Who's in here?

1050
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,700
Military police!

1051
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,860
I'm here for Luke Peterson.

1052
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,685
How do I get through this maze?

1053
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,020
Left, right, right, left, left,

1054
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,580
right, left, then straight.

1055
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,780
Got it?

1056
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,081
Yeah.

1057
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,020
- Luke!
- Excuse me.

1058
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,209
But you're interrupting
detention right now.

1059
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,124
Who are you exactly?

1060
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,940
What's going on?

1061
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,890
We need to go. Your sister...

1062
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:00,841
Oh, shit.

1063
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,420
Who else is in here?

1064
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,580
No one. It's just us two.

1065
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:14,860
Where are the lights controlled from?

1066
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,446
There's a DJ booth in the back.

1067
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,940
We need to get out of here.
Now. Where's the back exit?

1068
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,049
It's this way. Follow me.

1069
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,406
Come on.

1070
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,966
Just this way.

1071
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,740
Slow down.

1072
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,606
Run! Go out the other way! Go!

1073
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,806
Hello, sir.

1074
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:24,328
You shouldn't have followed me.

1075
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,362
I don't know what you expected.

1076
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,660
Shit.

1077
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:37,804
Anna, I don't know what's going on,
but David wouldn't hurt us.

1078
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,407
Luke, I need you to trust me.

1079
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Just come on.
- What?

1080
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:58,167
Shit.

1081
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,561
Come on.

1082
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:15,900
I need you to hide in here. Okay?

1083
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,300
What? No way.

1084
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,740
Anna, look, David was probably
just after that army guy.

1085
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:20,980
Let's just...

1086
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,441
Let's go talk to him.

1087
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,921
Luke.

1088
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,883
He killed Mom and Dad.

1089
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,247
No, he didn't. You're just saying that.

1090
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,331
What?

1091
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,930
Mom and Dad are...

1092
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,300
Please, Luke.

1093
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,568
Okay, you need to hide in there.

1094
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,780
I'm going to lead him away.

1095
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,209
You can't come out unless
you hear me or the police.

1096
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,530
I'm going to come back for you.

1097
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,482
I'm really sorry about this, guys.

1098
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:18,570
I tried to think of
another way to do it.

1099
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,923
Any other solution.

1100
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1101
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:37,681
Luke!

1102
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,809
Come on out, buddy.

1103
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,524
I'm not going to hurt you.

1104
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,484
You killed my parents.

1105
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,281
I did.

1106
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,761
Yes.

1107
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1108
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:33,922
Stop it. It'll be over in a second.

1109
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,166
Hey, Luke.

1110
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,565
You did the right thing.

1111
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,410
I don't blame you.

1112
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,209
Don't feel bad.

1113
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:56,840
Thank you.

1114
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,260
You okay?

1115
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:59,721
Yeah. Are you?

1116
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,846
Yeah.

1117
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,170
Follow the light.

1118
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,890
You both feeling okay?

1119
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,290
We're fine.

1120
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,444
Great. I'll be right back.

1121
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:57,401
Copy that.

1122
01:34:58,440 --> 01:34:59,860
What's the deal?

1123
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,860
Guess there's two bodies inside,
both of them pretty badly burned.

1124
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,940
One of the guys said
their teeth are missing,

1125
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,180
got knocked out, so I don't
know what the deal is.

1126
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,820
As soon as we get the
all clear, you can go in.

1127
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,121
Okay.

1128
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:42,131
What the fuck!
