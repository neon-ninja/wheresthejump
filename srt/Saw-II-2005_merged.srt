1
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,482
Help!

2
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:33,007
Anyone!
Help!

3
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,537
Hello, Michael.

4
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,039
I want to play a game.

5
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,377
So far, in what could loosely
be called your life...

6
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,581
you've made a living
watching others.

7
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:08,116
Society would call you
an informant, a rat, a snitch.

8
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:11,891
I call you unworthy
of the body you possess...

9
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,866
of the life
that you've been given.

10
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,529
Now, we will see if you are
willing to look inward...

11
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,038
rather than outward...

12
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,768
To give up the one thing
you rely on...

13
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,742
in order to go on living.

14
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,577
The device around your neck
is a death mask.

15
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,843
The mask is on a spring timer.

16
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,613
If you do not locate
the key in time...

17
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,052
the mask will close.

18
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:39,353
Think of it
like a Venus flytrap.

19
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:45,294
What you are looking at
right now is your own body...

20
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,196
not more than two hours ago.

21
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,326
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry.

22
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,929
You're sound asleep
and can't feel a thing.

23
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,442
Taking into account that you are
at a great disadvantage here...

24
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,603
I am going to give you a hint
as to where I've hidden the key.

25
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,842
So listen carefully.
The hint is this...

26
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,448
it's right before your eyes.

27
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,717
How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Michael?

28
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,089
Live or die. Make your choice.

29
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,287
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?!

30
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,023
Who the fuck are you?!

31
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,260
No!

32
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,354
No more!

33
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,124
Someone help me!

34
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,029
Fuck!

35
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,071
Do it!

36
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,470
Fuck!

37
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:14,944
Help me!

38
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,648
Please! Please!

39
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,748
Fuck!

40
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,190
Please!

41
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,355
No, no, no, no, no, no!

42
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,395
- 'Scuse me.
- Help you?

43
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,827
Here for Daniel Mathews.

44
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,462
Sign these.

45
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,468
Thanks.

46
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,804
Let's go, Daniel.

47
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:16,972
Took you long enough.

48
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,814
I'm sorry I didn't have it
penciled in on my schedule.

49
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,445
They're gonna press charges,
you know.

50
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,956
Yeah. They're assholes.

51
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,992
Course they are.
You stole from them.

52
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,720
This works out great
for me, though.

53
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:34,198
Your mother gets to keep custody,
I get to take you <i>into</i> custody.

54
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,827
What is it with you?

55
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,732
You a tough guy
'cause you steal now?

56
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,209
Please, save me
the after school special.

57
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,338
- Why are you such a cop 24/7?
- Hey, it's called being a father.

58
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,382
Trust me,
you're better at being a cop.

59
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,077
I just think I should go
back to Mom's early.

60
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,281
- What did you say?
- What, can you not hear me?

61
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,120
No, I can't hear you.
Say it again.

62
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,592
I think I should go
back to Mom's...

63
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,185
Well, then go!

64
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,797
Jesus.

65
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,669
Hey, this is Daniel.
Leave a message.

66
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,236
It's Dad. Sorry about yesterday.

67
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,043
Look, I haven't heard from you.

68
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,414
Would you give me
a call, please?

69
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,087
Daniel.

70
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,265
I'm sorry, sarge.
I thought you were my son.

71
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,429
Yeah. I'll be right there.

72
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:49,999
What do you got?

73
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,374
County asbestos cleaners
were working on a deadline.

74
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,640
One of them finds a body,
calls it in.

75
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:58,445
Says that this whole section's
been abandoned for two years.

76
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,315
Spotted people
down here, though.

77
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,411
- Who?
- Well, homeless, mostly.

78
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,548
Bunch of kids held a rave
in the boiler room about two months back.

79
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,990
Get an estimate
on the time of death?

80
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,321
Forensics just got here.

81
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,659
But it was the arriving officer
who called it in as your buddy.

82
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,631
He wasn't my buddy,
he was an informant.

83
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,633
This officer I.D.'d him
just by looking at him?

84
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:19,228
Well, he wasn't positive.
That's why I wanted you here.

85
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,466
All right.
Let me get a look at his face.

86
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,475
I'll tell you in two seconds
if it's him or not.

87
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,103
Therein lies the problem.

88
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,034
Yeah, that's Mike.

89
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,643
When were you gonna
tell me about that?

90
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,846
Thought you'd want to see it
for yourself.

91
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,591
OK. Well, I saw it.

92
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,649
I'll have to admit
it's a little early, but...

93
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,786
so far, everything matches
Jigsaw's pattern.

94
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,889
I can see that.
What do you want with me?

95
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,992
Let's just pretend for a second
that this is new to us, all right?

96
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,003
Can you think of anyone
that would want to do this to your guy?

97
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,063
Well, he's an informant, Kerry.
You want a list of possible suspects?

98
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,402
Grab a phone book.

99
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,535
Crackhead county punks
don't have engineering degrees.

100
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,842
Now, I'd say that
our cause of death here...

101
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,712
narrows that list down
just a little bit, wouldn't you?

102
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,753
Sure. And you're the expert.

103
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:46,121
Look closer, Detective Mathews.

104
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,591
At what?

105
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,130
Ask whoever wrote it.

106
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,877
Hello, Michael.
I want to play a game.

107
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:15,617
So far, in what could loosely
be called your life...

108
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,088
you have made a living
watching others.

109
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,990
You know, you and that guy
have a lot in common, Kerry.

110
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,118
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

111
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,957
Both like playing games
with people.

112
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,554
Excuse me?

113
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,622
Don't ever pull some shit like that again
on me at a crime scene.

114
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,258
Look, I'm not the one
taunting you. He is.

115
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,530
Doesn't mean I have
to take the bait.

116
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,537
Besides, I got
a full caseload as it is.

117
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,473
A bunch of desk errands
and shit work.

118
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,374
Yeah, well, between that,
I.A. breathing down my neck...

119
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,675
my son's budding criminal career,
and my wife's fucking divorce lawyers...

120
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,272
I'd say my hands are pretty full,
wouldn't you?

121
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,614
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry.

122
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,281
I was hoping, maybe,
that I could bring you in on this one.

123
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,823
We're not partners anymore, Kerry.

124
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,859
Forget that we're not partners,
what about the fact...

125
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,757
that this guy wrote your fucking name
on the wall, huh?

126
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,852
He asked for you.

127
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,296
It's not the first time
some psychopath called me out.

128
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,596
All right. What about the fact
that I'm asking?

129
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,643
Can't help you.

130
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,145
- Wow.
- You're the Jigsaw expert.

131
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,782
When did you stop being a cop?

132
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,387
Look closer, Detective Mathews.

133
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,393
This guy wrote your fucking name
on the wall.

134
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,495
Look closer, Detective Mathews.

135
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,671
He asked for you.

136
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,468
All right, fellas. Listen up.

137
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,642
These are the best entry points.

138
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,379
They're the ones
with direct street frontage...

139
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,972
vehicle access, and good cover.
Now remember...

140
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,608
we're doing this
in broad daylight.

141
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,175
We don't want to scare
any civilians.

142
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,016
I've been there before,
I know the location.

143
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,112
Just bust in there...

144
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,350
and scare the shit out of anyone
who happens to be inside, OK?

145
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,417
Going in teams of three.
I'll go with Team Alpha.

146
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,757
Let's do this.

147
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,701
Just like the good
old days, huh?

148
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,141
Thought your caseload
was big enough as it is.

149
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,700
Just tagging along for the ride.

150
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,514
Go, go, go, go, go.

151
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,590
Help team, I want you in front.
Baker, flank the side.

152
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,031
Let's do this.

153
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,227
Go, go, go.

154
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,963
Go, go, go, go.

155
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,561
Keep moving, keep moving.

156
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,135
Clear, clear, clear.
Alpha's up first.

157
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,013
Freeze!

158
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,849
What the fuck?

159
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,131
Man down!

160
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,963
Officer down, officer down!

161
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,874
- The fucking place is wired!
- Officer down! Officer down!

162
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,272
Fuck this.
Second team, get in here now!

163
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,510
- Go, go, go!
- Second team, get here.

164
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,486
Guys.

165
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,992
Talk to me, guys.

166
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,062
Go. Go.

167
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,035
Officer down.

168
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,068
Move him out. Move him out.

169
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,669
Clear, clear, clear.
Let's go.

170
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,382
Move out!

171
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,197
Freeze! Don't move.

172
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,393
Let me see your hands!
Not gonna ask again!

173
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,028
Put your hands
where I can see them!

174
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,594
Down on your knees!

175
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,907
Down on your knees!

176
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,910
I'm afraid I can't do that.

177
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,886
Get him in restraints, now.

178
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,923
You have the right
to remain silent.

179
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,091
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford one...

180
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,068
one will be appointed to you
by the city.

181
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,366
He's clean!

182
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:40,904
Hey.

183
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,950
Is this close enough?

184
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,387
Get his ass out of here.

185
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,284
Actually, I will need
to remain here...

186
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,422
while you deal with your problem,
Detective Mathews.

187
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,629
What problem?

188
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,000
The problem in that room.

189
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,179
You keep him secure.

190
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,881
Clear.

191
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,168
Shit.

192
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,670
- What?
- I don't know.

193
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,708
Shit.

194
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,082
I think that's my son.

195
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:33,648
Fuck.

196
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,592
He's got my son.

197
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,958
What the fuck is that?

198
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,060
Hey! Hey!
What the fuck is that?

199
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,729
It's your son Daniel.
You remember him, don't you?

200
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,102
I know who he is,
you piece of shit.

201
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,198
What is he doing
on that fuckin' monitor?

202
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,266
Well, I haven't looked
at the monitors for some time...

203
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,868
so it'd be hard for me to say.

204
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,244
But I would imagine that, um...

205
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,909
he's cowering in a corner
with a look on his face...

206
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,383
- You motherfucker!
- No, Eric. Wait.

207
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,148
You motherfucker!
Where is he? Where is he?!

208
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,747
Where is he? That's a problem
you're gonna have to solve...

209
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:06,950
before it's too late.

210
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,893
He has about two hours...

211
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,362
before the gas creeping
into his nervous system...

212
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,763
begins to break down
his body tissue...

213
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,792
and he begins to bleed
from every orifice he has.

214
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,705
Oh, yes. There will be blood.

215
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,611
Tell me where he is.

216
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,714
He's in a safe place.

217
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,955
Eric.

218
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,826
I need a phone.

219
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,229
Eric, just listen to me
for a second.

220
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,664
Just give me a phone!

221
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,764
Look, everything about this
fits his profile.

222
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,468
I need to be sure.

223
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,101
You've reached Daniel's phone.

224
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,646
He's not in right now.
But if you'd leave...

225
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:05,977
I'm sorry.

226
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,781
We have something
counting down over here.

227
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,049
Get me bomb squad now.

228
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,866
Hey.

229
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,837
Hey, wake up.

230
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,840
Hey.

231
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:38,944
Can you hear me?

232
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,784
She's still breathing.

233
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,956
What is this, house arrest?

234
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,295
- We in jail?
- No. This ain't jail, man.

235
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,996
Yeah, you done a lot of time?

236
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,198
Yeah. Too much.

237
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,036
Somebody open the fucking door!

238
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,236
I don't think
anybody's listening.

239
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,705
Damn. What the fuck is this?

240
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,340
Somebody's listening.

241
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,312
No.

242
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,714
Those types of cameras
don't have sound.

243
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,085
Fuck!

244
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:23,986
Fuck!

245
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,230
How do you just wake up in a room
and have no idea where you are?

246
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,495
I guess you never
been drunk before.

247
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,400
I've been drunk.
I spent three years at college.

248
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,939
Drunk... this isn't drunk.
This is kidnapping.

249
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:44,014
Look, I saw this movie
on TV last week.

250
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,744
This guy, he was a reporter,
and he goes into this war zone, right?

251
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,184
He goes to sleep in his hotel room
the first night.

252
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,846
Bam! He wakes up
the next morning.

253
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,051
He's in a cell with no windows
and no light.

254
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,289
And he spent nine years
in that room.

255
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:02,397
Nine years? Man, that's nothing.
Get over it.

256
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,025
What do you mean, get over it?

257
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,797
I mean stop bitching about it
and let's do something.

258
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,133
I think we should all
just calm down.

259
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,731
Shut up! Shut up!
I hear something.

260
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,878
What is it?

261
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,574
It's ticking. I hear ticking.

262
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,304
Hey. Hey. Hey. Calm down.

263
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,805
Calm down. What's your name?

264
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,807
Amanda.

265
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,403
- Where am I?
- I don't know.

266
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,346
Nobody knows. We all just
woke up here like you.

267
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:57,583
No! No!

268
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,680
- No!
- It's OK.

269
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,815
No!

270
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,892
Fuck!

271
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,523
What?

272
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,502
What are you looking for?

273
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,328
What is this?

274
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,370
Everything you need to know
is on this.

275
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,602
Greetings and welcome.

276
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:53,338
I trust that you are all
wondering where you are.

277
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,643
I can assure you that,
while your location is not important...

278
00:21:56,715 --> 00:22:00,947
what these walls offer for you
<i>is</i> important...

279
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,182
salvation, if you earn it.

280
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,885
Three hours from now,
the door to this house will open.

281
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:12,692
Unfortunately,
you only have two hours to live.

282
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:16,825
Right now you are breathing in
a deadly nerve agent.

283
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,530
You've been breathing it
since you arrived here.

284
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:22,539
Those of you familiar
with the Tokyo subway attacks...

285
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:26,338
will know its devastating
effects on the human body.

286
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:29,209
The only way to overcome it
and walk out that door...

287
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,875
is to find an antidote.

288
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,578
Several are hidden
around this house.

289
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,087
One is inside the safe
in front of you.

290
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:42,354
You all possess
the combination to the safe.

291
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,224
Think hard.

292
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,389
The numbers are in
the back of your mind.

293
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:51,300
The clues of their order
can be found over the rainbow.

294
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,032
Once you realize
what you all have in common...

295
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:58,270
you will be in a better understanding
of why you're here.

296
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:02,370
"X" marks the spot for that clue,
so look carefully.

297
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,074
Let the game begin.

298
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,119
- Who is this?
- What does he mean, gas?

299
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,212
And how did you know
where to find this?

300
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,881
This is bullshit.

301
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,590
"Do not attempt to use this key
on the door to this room."

302
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,131
Fuck this, man.

303
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,166
Yeah, fuck this.
That's a good idea.

304
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,170
No, no. That's not a good idea.

305
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,502
So what are we gonna do, huh?
Sit here?

306
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,734
The note said
not to use the key.

307
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,003
Who gives a shit
about the note, all right?

308
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,068
This is all a fuckin'
big goddamn joke.

309
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,477
And I'm about to end it.

310
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,959
You better start talking
right now.

311
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,502
- What is this?
- It's a game.

312
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,301
Ain't no fuckin' game!
My man just got his head blown off!

313
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,239
- He's testing us.
- Who's testing us?

314
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,142
- Jigsaw.
- Who the hell is Jigsaw?

315
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,180
You don't watch
the fuckin' news?

316
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,306
- No. Who is he?
- He's a serial killer.

317
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:17,420
No, he's not. He's testing us.
He wants us to survive this.

318
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,480
But you have to play
by the fucking rules!

319
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,387
I'm gonna ask you again.
How do you know all this?

320
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,264
Because I've played before.

321
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,483
I want a tech team
in here now.

322
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,684
Find out where that feed
is coming from.

323
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,500
What do you want with me?

324
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,694
A little of your time,
detective.

325
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,296
I don't have any time.

326
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:12,036
You asked me what I wanted,
and I told you.

327
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,705
Believe me when I tell you
your son is in a lot of trouble.

328
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,752
And what if I give you
a little bit of my time, what then?

329
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,551
I only want to talk to you.
Everyone else must leave.

330
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,852
Those are my conditions.

331
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,859
No. It's a crime scene,
nobody leaves.

332
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,725
They don't have to leave the building,
they just have to leave this area...

333
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,128
long enough for me
to talk to you.

334
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,895
If you agree to that,
then you will see your son again.

335
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,134
If I don't see my son again...

336
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,766
I swear to God,
I'll rip your fuckin' head off.

337
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,842
I don't intend
to mock you, officer...

338
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,972
but I'm a cancer patient.

339
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,448
How could you possibly
put me in any more pain...

340
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:53,950
than I'm already in?

341
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,783
Just get them here now.

342
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,624
All right,
tech team's on the way.

343
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,721
Should have your signal traced
within an hour, maybe two.

344
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,163
He said he wants to talk to me alone.

345
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,598
Well, maybe you should talk to him.

346
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,727
Well, fuck that.
Five minutes, old-school method.

347
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,862
He's not gonna respond to
the phone book treatment, you know that.

348
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,702
Don't underestimate
a tried and true method here.

349
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,366
I am the one who's been working
on this case from day one.

350
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,672
I have been spending every
waking moment piecing it together.

351
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,042
Maybe that's why you ain't got
a goddamn family for yourself...

352
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,445
and you can't understand
what this man is going through.

353
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,946
Look...

354
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,752
I don't want to talk to him.

355
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,953
Listen, you already lost
your son one time before...

356
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,087
because you got involved with me.

357
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,259
It's not gonna happen again.

358
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,463
This is bullshit.
What are we gonna do?

359
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:50,599
Just humor him,
buy us a little more time.

360
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:54,634
We can win this, Eric.
We can beat him.

361
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,276
All right.

362
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,544
Find an antidote.

363
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,384
Several are hidden
around this house.

364
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:08,688
One is inside the safe
in front of you.

365
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,752
You all possess
the combination to the safe.

366
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:16,199
Think hard. The numbers
are in the back of your mind.

367
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,563
Think hard. The numbers
are in the back of your mind.

368
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,508
The clues of their order
can be found...

369
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,220
Shit.

370
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,431
Hey, wait a minute.
Where you going?

371
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,803
I'm gonna find an antidote,
and I'm gonna get out of here.

372
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,809
What? Antidote?
You been in the joint.

373
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,606
You talked to the guards
that run the chambers.

374
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,806
You know there ain't no antidote
for this shit.

375
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,145
Look at this.
The doors are locked.

376
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,845
Hear that? It's wood.

377
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,412
Plus, dog, it's not a fortress,
it's a fucking house.

378
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,287
All I'm saying is
let's just take our time...

379
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,586
and come up with a game plan.

380
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,491
Well, you come up
with a game plan.

381
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,894
All right?
I'm gettin' out of here.

382
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,370
Look.

383
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,023
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

384
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,744
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

385
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,014
You don't know what's behind
that fuckin' door.

386
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,494
Fuck.

387
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,962
Shit.

388
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,738
Clear the room.

389
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,576
OK.

390
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,648
Let's talk.

391
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,053
Sit down, Eric.

392
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,767
I want to play a game.

393
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,171
The rules are simple.

394
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,675
All you have to do
is sit here and talk to me...

395
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,371
listen to me.

396
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,038
If you do that long enough...

397
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,878
then you will find your son
in a safe and secure state.

398
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,919
We haven't been
properly introduced.

399
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,011
My name's John.

400
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,953
I thought you liked
to be called Jigsaw.

401
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,287
No.

402
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,318
It was the police and the press
who coined the nickname Jigsaw.

403
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,296
I never encouraged
or claimed that.

404
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,266
The Jigsaw piece I cut
from my subjects...

405
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,235
was only ever meant
to be a symbol...

406
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:14,328
that that subject
was missing something...

407
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,896
a vital piece
of the human puzzle...

408
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,465
the survival instinct.

409
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:22,536
This is all really,
really interesting, John.

410
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,772
But right now I'd really like
for you to talk to me...

411
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,942
I <i>am</i> talking to you.

412
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,550
You're not listening.

413
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,454
- Don't forget the rules.
- I'm listening to you.

414
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,585
But all I'm hearing is
the same sick fucking bullshit...

415
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,892
that comes about two seconds
into every interview...

416
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,955
I've ever done
with one of you fuckin' people.

417
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,866
Well, that's an interesting approach
to police work, isn't it?

418
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:48,565
Aren't you supposed to be
convincing me that I'm your friend...

419
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,473
lulling me into
a false sense of security...

420
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,407
so that I'll confide in you?

421
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,571
It's a little hard
to follow the manual...

422
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,137
when you've got my son, John.

423
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,577
The manual?

424
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,346
What do you really want
to do to me right now?

425
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,389
What would you have done
five years ago?

426
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,219
Would you have followed
the manual then?

427
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:11,626
Would you have broken my jaw
with a flashlight?

428
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,062
You seem to know
a whole lot about me.

429
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:17,795
I know you were once considered
a fearless police officer.

430
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:24,204
Do you feel a whole lot safer
now that you only sit behind a desk?

431
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,800
I feel a whole lot of things
right now.

432
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:30,006
But you feel alive,
that's what you feel.

433
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,548
And that's the point.

434
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,483
Would you...

435
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,146
kindly...

436
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,849
get me a glass of water?

437
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,350
I would very much
appreciate that.

438
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,516
Fuck!

439
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,759
Well, we've established that
the macho bullshit approach...

440
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,822
isn't opening the door.

441
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,333
- Any other suggestions?
- Look who's talking.

442
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:28,065
The only door you know how to open
is between your legs.

443
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,868
Why don't you shut the hell up?!

444
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,034
- Why don't <i>you</i> shut the hell up?
- I'm sick of your bullshit!

445
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,881
Hey, hey, hey!
Back the fuck up! Back up!

446
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,075
OK, man. All right.

447
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,084
Nobody takes shit from nobody,
we've established that.

448
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,790
- Did you find anything?
- No. Nothing.

449
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,677
So, that ink on your arm...
that's Joliet, right?

450
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,609
Yeah. So?

451
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,477
- I did a stretch there myself.
- Proud of you.

452
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,643
And you, what is your
correctional facility of choice?

453
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,811
What's your point?

454
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,220
My point is, you didn't get that way
by teaching grade school, right?

455
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,453
That makes three of us
that's done time.

456
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,358
I think we should be
concentrating on that tape...

457
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,159
'cause that tape said we have
more in common than we know.

458
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:30,223
I say the three of us
doing stretches...

459
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:33,930
Hey! I found a door over here.

460
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,585
I need the flashlight.

461
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,049
Over there.

462
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,358
What the fuck?

463
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,368
Oh, shit.

464
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,041
Hey!

465
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:51,013
- Damn, kid.
- Sorry.

466
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:01,823
"Obi." What the fuck is a Obi?

467
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>Ah-bi.</i> It's my name.

468
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,673
Hello, Obi.
I want to play a game.

469
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,678
For years you have burned
those around you...

470
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:25,375
with your lies, cons,
and deceits.

471
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,849
Now you'll have a chance
to redeem yourself...

472
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,547
for the games you played
with others...

473
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,851
by playing one of mine.

474
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:36,690
Inside the device in front of you
are two antidotes...

475
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,855
for the poison
coursing through your veins.

476
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:43,389
One is my gift to you for
helping me kidnap the others.

477
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,527
The second is yours to donate.

478
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:49,596
However, one of them
will come with a price.

479
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,539
Remember, Obi...

480
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,510
once you are in hell...

481
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,412
only the devil can help you out.

482
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,939
Wait a minute. What does that mean,
"kidnap the others"?

483
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,418
- How would I know?
- Because you put us here.

484
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,551
The car.

485
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,386
It was...

486
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:16,490
I knew I knew him.

487
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:22,303
You're the last person I saw
before I woke up here.

488
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,009
You did this.

489
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,106
Are you sure it's him?
You better be sure.

490
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,411
I'm sure.

491
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,917
You would have done the same.
I did what I had to do.

492
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,682
I'll give you a choice.

493
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,485
You got five seconds
to get us out of here.

494
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,458
I don't know the way out.

495
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:47,089
Bullshit! You put us in here,
you can get us out of here!

496
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,156
No, I can't.

497
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:53,101
- Then you're a dead man.
- So are you.

498
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,138
It's not gonna...
wait, wait, wait, wait.

499
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,696
Listen to me.

500
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,503
We got two antidotes
at the back of that oven.

501
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,840
- We're wasting time here.
- Wasting time?

502
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,003
Are you kidding me?!

503
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,344
He kidnapped me
in the middle of the night.

504
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,384
We don't even know
what's in those syringes.

505
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,181
You willing to stick yourself
in the arm to find out?

506
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,243
Yeah.

507
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:14,519
OK, wait. So who gets them?
I mean, there's two...

508
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:15,820
so which two people
get the antidote?

509
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,019
We'll work that out later!

510
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,294
Right now you goin' in there...

511
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,004
or I'll kill you
where you stand.

512
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,805
Shit.

513
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,646
If you're gonna threaten me
with a knife...

514
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,487
you may as well cut me a little.

515
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,321
I guess I'm going in there
to get those needles.

516
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:55,888
But I get one.

517
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,231
One for me.

518
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,927
Hurry up.

519
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,237
Come on, baby.

520
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,138
You guys can fight
over this one.

521
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,376
Thank you, Obi.

522
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,643
Come on.

523
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,579
Oh, shit.
The fuckin' door closed.

524
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,776
Open the door!

525
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:48,841
Open the door!

526
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,320
It's locked! I can't open it!

527
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,881
Open the door!

528
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,321
Open the fuckin' door!

529
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,728
Not funny!

530
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,561
Come on! Get him out of there!

531
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,328
The door!

532
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,233
The nail!

533
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,066
I can't get it open!

534
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,000
- Get him out of there!
- Not funny!

535
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,697
Use your coat!
Use your fucking coat!

536
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,995
Come on! He's burnin' up!

537
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,329
Stop it!

538
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,766
- Come on!
- Turn!

539
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,436
Stop it!

540
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,877
- Got to put your weight on it!
- Stop it.

541
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:56,216
Guys, there's a window
over here.

542
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,152
- He's got the antidote.
- Stop it!

543
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,658
- It's glass or something.
- Hang on, man.

544
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,162
We're gonna get you out.

545
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,730
Stop it! Stop it!

546
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:14,202
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

547
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,466
Get out of the fuckin' way!
Move! Move!

548
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:21,639
Shit! Come on!

549
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

550
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,243
The needles!
He's got the fuckin' needles!

551
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's fuckin' in there!
I want the fuckin' needles!
- I want the fuckin' needles!
- Calm down!
- Fuck!
- Needles are fuckin' melted.

552
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,252
They're gone.

553
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,552
He had a choice.

554
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,365
Another one down, Kerry.

555
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:20,164
How much more time are we gonna
waste on this bastard?

556
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:22,228
We're not wasting time.
We are doing exactly what we should be.

557
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:23,637
Not what it looks like to me.

558
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,232
You see, detective,
Darwin's theory of evolution...

559
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,572
and survival of the fittest...

560
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,875
based on his little trip
to the Galapagos...

561
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,380
no longer applies
on this planet.

562
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:33,712
We have a human race
that doesn't have the edge...

563
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:35,945
or the will to survive.

564
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,385
What the fuck do you want?!

565
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,046
It's hard to remain calm,
isn't it...

566
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:42,559
when your son is walking around
on those monitors.

567
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,184
I can't give you
what you want...

568
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,126
if you don't tell me
what the fuck it is.

569
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:49,757
I told you what it is.
Just remember the rules.

570
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,061
No, you said you wanted to talk.

571
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,762
Then you said
you wanted to play a game.

572
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,236
You're talking,
but it means nothing!

573
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:58,298
What do you think
the cure for cancer is, Eric?

574
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,433
What?

575
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,001
The cure for cancer. What is it?

576
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,171
I don't know what it is.

577
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,511
But I know it's not killing
and torturing people...

578
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,073
for your own
sick fucking pleasure.

579
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,642
I've never murdered anyone
in my life.

580
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,688
The decisions are up to them.

581
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,120
Yeah, well, putting a gun
to someone's head...

582
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,782
and forcing them to pull the trigger
is still murder.

583
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,917
Since when is force
a problem for you?

584
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,024
Why are you so desperate
to get your son back?

585
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:26,600
'Cause he's my son.

586
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,969
What's the last thing you said to him
before you left him?

587
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:33,603
Well, then go!

588
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:37,939
Seems to me that the knowledge
of your son's impending death...

589
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,710
is causing you to act.

590
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,579
Why is that we're
only willing to do that...

591
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,887
when a life is at stake?

592
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,950
I've always loved my son.
That's never changed.

593
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,861
No, no. It's changed now.

594
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,427
You see, the knowledge of death
changes everything.

595
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:01,733
If I were to tell you the exact date
and time of your own death...

596
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,002
it would shatter
your world completely.

597
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,770
I know.

598
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,979
Can you imagine
what it feels like...

599
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:11,742
to have someone sit you down...

600
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,476
John Kramer?

601
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,450
...and tell you
that you're dying?

602
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,089
The gravity of that, hmm?

603
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,822
That the clock's ticking for you.

604
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,392
In a split second,
your world is cracked open.

605
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:35,996
You look at things differently,
you smell things differently.

606
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:39,133
You savor everything,
be it a glass of water...

607
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:40,733
or a walk in the park.

608
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,711
The clock is ticking, John.

609
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,304
But most people have the luxury
of not knowing...

610
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,780
when that clock's gonna go off.

611
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,749
And the irony of it is
that that keeps them...

612
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,183
from really living their life.

613
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,778
It keeps them drinking
that glass of water...

614
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,119
but never really tasting it.

615
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,557
You can still fix this, John.

616
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,726
Yeah, but can we fix you?

617
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,231
Me?

618
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,995
I'm not fixable.

619
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,434
I've got cancer.

620
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,308
You're using cancer as an excuse
for what you do?

621
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,810
No.

622
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,209
The cancer isn't
what started me in my work.

623
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,582
It was the moment that
I decided to end my life...

624
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,417
that started me in my work...

625
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:28,014
and brought meaning to it.

626
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:37,061
I had literally
driven myself to suicide...

627
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,398
and I had failed.

628
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,962
My body had not been strong enough
to repel cancer cells...

629
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,941
yet I had lived through
a plunge off a cliff.

630
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:56,180
But to my amazement,
I was alive.

631
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,586
And I was determined to spend
the rest of my days...

632
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:03,251
testing the fabric
of human nature.

633
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:09,989
Do you understand, Eric?

634
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:14,604
You got a chance to do something.
Do it right now, John.

635
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,265
Just tell me where my son is.

636
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,673
- I'll help you.
- I don't need your help...

637
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:22,541
and I can tell
you still don't understand.

638
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:27,346
Those that don't appreciate life
do not deserve life.

639
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,476
My son appreciates his life.

640
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,544
But do you appreciate yours?

641
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,886
Do you appreciate your son's?

642
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,515
Oh, what is this shit?!

643
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,322
Don't forget the rules...

644
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,833
if you want to find your son.

645
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,403
Where are you?

646
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,339
No. No, we don't have
15 minutes.

647
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:54,377
We need that location
to the video feed.

648
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,260
Hey. I don't think
we should stop, OK?

649
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:13,262
Hello? Can you hear me?

650
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,165
It's the second time
I've had to wake up...

651
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,759
in this shit hole.

652
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,304
You think you can stand up?

653
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:27,070
Yeah. But I don't
really want to.

654
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:31,444
There's so much left to do.

655
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,949
So many people left to talk to.

656
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,983
This can't be it.

657
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:45,587
It's not.

658
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,794
Amanda, you said
you survived this, right?

659
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,033
I what?

660
00:47:57,107 --> 00:48:00,201
This guy...
whoever's doing it...

661
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,711
you said that you've played before,
and you survived.

662
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,303
Yeah.

663
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,906
So that means we could survive.

664
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,246
Yeah.

665
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:14,389
Amanda, why did he pick you?

666
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:17,894
Because I was a fuckin' junkie.

667
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,963
And the funny thing is...

668
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:30,632
I passed the little test.

669
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:34,234
If you passed his test,
then why are you back here?

670
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:39,707
I wasn't being very good
to myself.

671
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:51,191
How long have you...

672
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:52,990
I started in jail.

673
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:57,427
- What were you arrested for?
- Possession.

674
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,703
But, I thought you said that...

675
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,865
Maybe you should talk
to the cop who arrested me.

676
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,037
I'm guessing you've never
been arrested before.

677
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:13,173
No. I mean, I've been in trouble
a few times, you know?

678
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,117
In and out of stuff.
My dad's a...

679
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,185
He's a real hard-ass.

680
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:27,159
He's probably got half the city
right now looking for me...

681
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,825
just so he can kick my ass
for disappearing on him.

682
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,233
Yeah. Probably.

683
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:45,340
We found a door. Come on.

684
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,643
Come on. We have to go.

685
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,190
It's the only one
without a lock...

686
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:56,191
but we can't get it open.

687
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,169
- How's it going?
- It's stuck on something.

688
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:15,677
Oh, shit.

689
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,407
Here, let me try. Move, move!

690
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,108
- Come on.
- Take it easy. Jeez!

691
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,706
Back up, all right?

692
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

693
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,958
If it's stuck, it's a trap.

694
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,561
Lady, this whole house
is a trap.

695
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,606
Obviously someone didn't want us
to get in this room.

696
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:12,992
- Now what?
- I'm gonna be right back, OK?

697
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,231
Whatever we do, we got
three minutes to get it done.

698
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:36,793
Hello, Xavier.
I want to play a game.

699
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,694
The game I want to play
is very similar...

700
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,291
to the one that you've
been playing as a drug dealer.

701
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,858
A game of offering hope
to the desperate...

702
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,495
for a price.

703
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:53,305
I think we can agree that
your situation is desperate...

704
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:54,934
so I offer you hope.

705
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,808
The price you pay...

706
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,178
is that you must crawl
into the same pit of squalor...

707
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:02,878
your force your customers into.

708
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,548
By entering this room,
a timer has been started.

709
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,215
When the timer expires...

710
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,759
the door in front of you
will be locked forever.

711
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:13,159
- Guys... guys.
- What?

712
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,390
...before the timer runs out.

713
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,194
Can you unlock it...

714
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,861
and retrieve the antidote inside?

715
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:23,838
I will give you just one hint
as to where that key is

716
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,372
It will be like finding
a needle in a haystack.

717
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:37,186
Let the game begin.

718
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,054
Somebody's going in there.

719
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:43,319
Somebody is fuckin'
going in there, man.

720
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,160
No! No! No!

721
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:51,894
- Oh, shit.
- What did you do?

722
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,993
What have you done?

723
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,537
No! No! No!

724
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,903
No! No! No!

725
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,838
Shit!

726
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,440
My God.

727
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,917
Come on! We don't have time!

728
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,578
Oh, shit.

729
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,690
What the fuck's wrong with you?

730
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,058
What are you doing?

731
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:22,193
- You're out of your fuckin' mind.
- Hurry up.

732
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,098
Oh, shit!

733
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:28,103
Come on!

734
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:29,570
We don't have time.

735
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,409
Keep fuckin' looking.

736
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,308
- Come on! Come on!
- Fuck you!

737
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,374
Oh, God!

738
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:53,652
Someone's gotta help her.

739
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,097
What the fuck, guys?!

740
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,823
No. No. No. No.

741
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,356
No. God, no!

742
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,122
Come on.

743
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,998
No! No! No!

744
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:53,447
Fuckin' bitch!

745
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:54,854
All right. That's enough.

746
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:56,949
That's not nearly enough, man.

747
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,460
Stop this bullshit!

748
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,827
Did you hear that tape?

749
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,294
He knows about us.

750
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,894
Our names.

751
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,770
There is something
that we're not seeing.

752
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:13,069
Jail.

753
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,481
You said you three
had been there.

754
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,072
Make it four.

755
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,152
For what?

756
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,051
Doesn't matter.

757
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,556
Anybody else want to own up?

758
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:33,694
What about you? You got juvie
written all over you.

759
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:36,823
No, never been.

760
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,300
All right. Let's talk this out.

761
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,667
No. No more talking.

762
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:44,434
The only thing you people
have in common...

763
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,031
is holding me back.

764
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,105
I'm gone.

765
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,993
Where is this goddamn tech team?

766
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,364
They'll be here any second.

767
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:16,064
I'm not listening to this anymore.
Another second is too fuckin' long.

768
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,470
Look, I know how
this guy works, OK?

769
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,508
He's playing a game.

770
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,669
Eric just needs to stay in it
a little bit longer.

771
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:23,645
Take a look at the clock.

772
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:27,578
You need to start thinking
outside the box...

773
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,208
or his son
is gonna end up in one.

774
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,725
His work.

775
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,754
You want to get to him,
that's how you do it.

776
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,426
He's relishing this.

777
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,401
It's an opportunity to be heard,
to be studied.

778
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,460
Threaten to destroy his work.

779
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:19,131
How will you get your conviction
without all this evidence, Eric?

780
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:20,829
I don't need this shit
to convict you.

781
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,429
So go ahead. Destroy it.

782
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,440
- I will.
- Destroy it all.

783
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,545
Just know it will not
save your son if you do.

784
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,342
You kill my son, I kill you.

785
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,906
Go ahead. Why wait?

786
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:37,111
We both know
the sort of person you are.

787
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:38,677
- Sir...
- Get out of here.

788
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:42,213
The sort of person who guns down
an unarmed suspect.

789
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,920
In fact, the sort of person
who plants evidence...

790
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:46,985
in order to obtain a conviction.

791
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:49,361
The sort of person
whose wife leaves him...

792
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:52,230
- and whose son hates him.
- Shut the fuck up!

793
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,571
He set up all the traces
to the satellite.

794
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,004
Let's go.

795
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,334
Your tech team's arrived.

796
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,845
Just in time.

797
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:08,548
You better hope they find
the source of that feed.

798
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:12,846
There's something
I haven't told you, Eric.

799
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:16,050
- I'm done listening to you.
- Maybe I can just show it to you.

800
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,889
But unfortunately, it's going to be
difficult for me to get it myself...

801
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:21,021
so perhaps you could ask
the people...

802
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,156
who are listening
on that walkie in there...

803
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,997
if they could get it for me,
all right?

804
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:28,367
Brown desk.

805
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,905
Second drawer down.

806
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:39,715
You might not remember
all those people...

807
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:43,013
but I'm sure they remember you.

808
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:46,783
You were the arresting officer
in all their cases...

809
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:50,087
and you were the one
who planted all the evidence...

810
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:51,888
used to obtain
their convictions.

811
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:53,553
You were the one
who put them away.

812
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:57,066
Your son is playing a game
with a lot of people...

813
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:59,260
who don't like you very much,
detective.

814
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:04,068
It would be a shame
if they discovered who he was.

815
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:01,655
You all possess
the combination to the safe.

816
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:05,326
Think hard. The numbers
are in the back of your mind.

817
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:09,303
The clues of their order
can be found over the rainbow.

818
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:11,169
Son of a bitch.

819
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,517
What are you doing?

820
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,993
I haven't decided yet.

821
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:36,828
You know, the others...
they're scared of you.

822
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:39,163
Good.

823
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:43,099
You and me...

824
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:46,232
we can keep going at each other
like we're back in the yard...

825
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:49,210
or we can come together
and figure out who's doing this to us.

826
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:52,475
You and the others
can do what you want.

827
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,378
I already found
what I'm looking for.

828
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,823
You remind me of me.

829
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:04,860
No matter what kind of
fucked up situation you're in...

830
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:06,724
you always gotta
find yourself an enemy.

831
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,696
You know what?

832
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:11,029
I got enemies, man.

833
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,194
Outside these fuckin' walls, bro.

834
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:19,101
And they're looking for me.
And if they don't find me...

835
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,439
they going after the ones
closest to me.

836
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,843
My family.

837
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:26,675
You understand?

838
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:31,945
No. I don't understand.

839
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,114
It's just me...

840
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,818
and that's the way I like it.

841
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:39,293
Now, turn around.

842
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,057
What?

843
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,758
Turn around.

844
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,179
Oh, shit.

845
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:06,613
No. We can't stop.

846
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:08,149
Shit.

847
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,687
Oh, my God.

848
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:16,751
We've been here for two hours.
If what that tape says is true...

849
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:19,624
then in one hour,
the front door will open.

850
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:22,562
- We're not gonna make it that long.
- That's a real winning attitude.

851
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,395
She knows what she's talking about.

852
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,434
Oh, yeah?

853
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,992
"X" marks the spot.

854
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,401
What?

855
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,337
"X" marks...

856
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:35,309
marks the spot.
There's the answer.

857
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,187
What are you doing with him?

858
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:50,191
This is your father?

859
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:53,990
- What, you know him?
- Yeah.

860
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:57,362
He's the guy who put me away.
He set me up.

861
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,162
Tell me that's not your father.

862
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,036
Fuck.

863
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:15,375
It's OK. It's OK.

864
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,432
I can't trust any of you.

865
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:44,642
You two are on your own.

866
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,453
Now we know
what we have in common.

867
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:55,387
Amanda, please. I didn't know.

868
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:59,957
Hey, kid, Amanda!

869
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:02,054
Where are you?

870
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:06,596
Please don't leave me.

871
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:34,694
We gotta move.

872
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,200
Hey, kid.

873
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,206
Amanda!

874
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,469
I found a way out.

875
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:02,957
Eight.

876
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:34,256
Hey, kid!

877
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:44,259
Do... not...

878
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,493
run.

879
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:14,020
Eric!

880
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:16,394
Eric! No! Stop!

881
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,059
Get your hands off of me!

882
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:20,898
We tried it your way.

883
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:28,376
You motherfucker, where is he?

884
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,371
Eric.

885
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:40,780
Damn it.

886
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:47,618
Not a lot to go now
until your son is pissing blood.

887
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:05,741
Now, that's the Eric Mathews
they gave medals to.

888
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:55,623
Help!

889
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:59,166
Help me!

890
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:03,904
Oh, my God.

891
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,407
Jonas.

892
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,466
Help me!

893
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,341
Help me!

894
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,884
Help!

895
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:35,097
Please.

896
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,729
It's OK.

897
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:39,865
- Help me.
- It's OK.

898
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,876
No!

899
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:51,647
Fucker!

900
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:04,530
No!

901
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:14,267
Amanda.

902
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:24,709
Nobody's listening anymore,
asshole.

903
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:31,558
Open your mouth.

904
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,925
Open your mouth. Come on.
There you go.

905
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:36,931
You gonna tell me
where he is now?

906
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:38,296
What?

907
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:42,663
Say it again.

908
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,767
Game... game over.

909
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,638
I'll take you to the house.

910
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:53,807
You're gonna take me right now.
Right now.

911
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:56,612
I will only take you.

912
01:10:58,153 --> 01:10:59,279
No one else.

913
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:05,188
All right.

914
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,320
Me and you.

915
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:09,762
How do we get out of here?

916
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:12,198
There's a button on the wall.

917
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,701
You better hurry.

918
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:17,665
There's not much time left.

919
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:40,551
- The elevator! Open it!
- Come on!

920
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,028
- Pull it down!
- Fuck!

921
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:44,258
Secure the warehouse now!

922
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:47,233
All right. Let's go!

923
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,998
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Damn it.

924
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:53,533
We've got a lock.

925
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,042
This is Kerry.
They're both gone.

926
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:05,245
If I don't find my son,
I swear to God...

927
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:11,715
Kerry, they're gone.
Fucking gone.

928
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,927
Yes! Kerry. We got a lock.
We got a lock on the house.

929
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,729
- Rigg, we got it.
- What?!

930
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:21,463
237 North Hyde Crescent.

931
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:23,266
237 North Hyde Crescent. Got it.

932
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,277
Where to now?

933
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,837
Straight ahead.

934
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,749
Come on, come on.
Where are you?

935
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:44,589
Make a right on Alfred.

936
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:51,398
Come on, let's go!

937
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:55,061
Open the fucking door!

938
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:57,799
Open the door!
There's nowhere to go!

939
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:01,036
All I want is the number
on the back of your head!

940
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:08,714
There's nowhere to go!
Come on, Amanda!

941
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:09,876
I can't hold it.

942
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:15,715
Come on, let me in! Let me in!

943
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:23,556
Open the door! Come on!

944
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:25,099
What do we do?

945
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,135
Take a left at the next street.

946
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:32,003
It's the last house on the left.

947
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,542
Oh, shit.

948
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,443
Oh, shit!

949
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:40,175
Come on!

950
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,149
Come on, Amanda!

951
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,913
- Man, what is it?
- It's a door.

952
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:46,955
It's a fucking door.

953
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:49,183
You have nowhere to go!
You have nowhere to go!

954
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:56,455
Come on!

955
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,830
Help me move this thing.

956
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,437
I'm not gonna hurt you!

957
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,013
Come on, Amanda!

958
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:15,777
- Shit, it's locked!
- Let me in!

959
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:18,883
Come on. Open this door!

960
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:21,353
Come on!

961
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,618
The key. The one we found
with the tape recorder.

962
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:25,683
Where is it? Where is it?

963
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,194
Fuck!

964
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:28,889
Jonas. Jonas had it last.

965
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:29,953
Come on, Amanda!

966
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:32,398
Find it! Hurry!

967
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,901
Come on!

968
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:41,702
Come on! Open this door!
Let me in!

969
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:52,312
Eric, you're gonna need
this key...

970
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,855
when you get inside the house.

971
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:18,005
No!

972
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,110
Where the hell are we?

973
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:30,014
Run! Run!

974
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:42,968
Daniel?

975
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,642
Daniel!

976
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:52,573
Daniel, we've got to go!
We've got to go!

977
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,479
Run.

978
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:05,422
- All right, come on.
- Let's go, let's go.

979
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,978
Go, go, go!

980
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:28,812
- Hallway's clear.
- We're in.

981
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:30,852
Daniel!

982
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,614
Ground floor secure.

983
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:33,950
Moving out. Moving out.

984
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:35,922
Kerry, we're in the house.
I repeat... we're in the house.

985
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:39,927
I cannot see you, sergeant.
Repeat... cannot see you.

986
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,430
Repeat... I cannot see you.

987
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:46,262
- Where the hell is everybody?
- What is your 20?

988
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:48,132
Rigg, do you copy?

989
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:17,123
Hello, Mr. Hindle.

990
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:18,632
Follow your heart.

991
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,361
I wish I would've
checked in there first.

992
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:22,562
What the fuck is this?

993
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,732
My name is "Very fucking confused!"
What's your name?

994
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,570
I'm gonna kill your husband now.

995
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,508
He doesn't want us
to cut through our chains.

996
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:31,978
What are you doing? No!

997
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:33,480
He wants us to cut
through our feet.

998
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:35,675
Oh, my God!

999
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:03,037
Daniel!

1000
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:11,879
Oh, no.

1001
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:16,718
Please.

1002
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:28,234
He's gone.

1003
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:30,566
It doesn't matter.

1004
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:33,107
All I want is the number
on the back of his neck.

1005
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:34,767
And then yours.

1006
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,870
You still don't know
your own number.

1007
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:43,247
How are you gonna get it
if I don't tell you?

1008
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,405
Daniel!

1009
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:11,634
Fuck.

1010
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:24,977
Daniel?

1011
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:29,090
I still cannot see you,
sergeant.

1012
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:31,591
Rigg, do you copy?

1013
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:37,355
- Left side clear.
- Right side clear.

1014
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:39,024
All clear.

1015
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:44,662
I still can't see you, sergeant.
I repeat... cannot see you.

1016
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:09,457
It's not live.

1017
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,294
Kerry, we're in
the wrong fucking house!

1018
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:14,096
They've been dead
this whole fucking time.

1019
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:15,659
- Get your team out of there.
- Let's go.

1020
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,399
Daniel?

1021
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,751
Daniel?

1022
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:55,999
Daniel?

1023
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:02,176
Daniel.

1024
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:15,658
Daniel.

1025
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Hello, Eric.

1026
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:05,831
You probably don't even
remember me...

1027
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:08,535
but you changed my life once.

1028
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,874
You sent me to prison.

1029
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:13,539
I was guilty
of a lot of things...

1030
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:17,551
but not the drug charge
you framed me for.

1031
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:19,644
You wouldn't know
the things you lose...

1032
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:22,121
when you're locked away.

1033
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:25,216
The second time somebody
changed my life...

1034
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:26,624
I <i>was</i> guilty.

1035
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:28,628
Hello, Amanda.

1036
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:30,721
But my life was saved that day.

1037
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:32,164
- You said you survived this, right?
- Yeah.

1038
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:36,564
I found myself a father...

1039
01:24:36,638 --> 01:24:39,505
a leader... a teacher.

1040
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:40,836
You must meet death...

1041
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:45,178
in order to be reborn.

1042
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,180
He helped me.

1043
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:49,842
What is the cure
for cancer, Eric?

1044
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,785
Those that don't appreciate life
do not deserve life.

1045
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:56,790
The cure for death itself.

1046
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:58,985
The answer is immortality.

1047
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:02,623
Daniel!

1048
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:07,092
By creating a legacy...

1049
01:25:07,168 --> 01:25:09,898
by living a life
worth remembering...

1050
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:12,235
you become immortal.

1051
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:15,834
So now we find
the tables are turned.

1052
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:16,877
He asked for you.

1053
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,435
- What the fuck do you want?
- I told you.

1054
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:21,710
- He wants us to survive this.
- I want to play a game.

1055
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,614
You have to play
by the fucking rules!

1056
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:25,380
The rules are simple.
All you have to do...

1057
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:27,284
- is sit here and talk to me.
- What?

1058
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:28,379
If you can do that
long enough...

1059
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:31,482
you will find your son
in a safe and secure state.

1060
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:32,526
What the fuck is that?

1061
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:34,152
It's your son Daniel.
You remember him, don't you?

1062
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:36,322
My dad's a real hard-ass.

1063
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:40,493
I call you unworthy of the life
you've been given.

1064
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:42,536
The knowledge of your son's
impending death...

1065
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:44,333
has caused you
to forgive all his sins.

1066
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:46,566
Why is it that we're
only willing to do that...

1067
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,302
- when a life is at stake?
- Daniel!

1068
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:50,537
- I'm not listening to you.
- Don't forget the rules.

1069
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:52,011
Shut the fuck up!

1070
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,377
- He's playing a game.
- I don't want to talk to him.

1071
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:54,676
You're not saying shit.

1072
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:56,182
We both know
the sort of person you are.

1073
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:58,742
Not long to go now
until your son is pissing...

1074
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:01,646
I'll take you to the house.

1075
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:03,315
Daniel?

1076
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,287
Something I haven't
told you, Eric.

1077
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:11,025
It is I who will carry on
John's work after he dies.

1078
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:12,930
Daniel!

1079
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,993
So go ahead. Destroy it.

1080
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:18,231
- And you...
- Daniel!

1081
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:21,332
are my first test subject.

1082
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,673
Now you are locked away...

1083
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:27,112
helpless and alone.

1084
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:31,615
Fucking bitch.

1085
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,449
Game over.

1086
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:35,614
I'll fucking kill you!

1087
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:38,557
You fucking bitch!

1088
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:41,060
You fucking bitch!

1089
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:44,861
I'll fucking kill you!

1090
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:47,128
No!

1091
01:28:47,231 --> 01:28:48,231
