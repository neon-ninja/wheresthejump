1
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,958
You sure you don't wanna use
the variable scope for this?

2
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,875
No. I've got a lock
on vector and trajectory.

3
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,791
You ever hear that saying,
"Listen to your elders"?

4
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,541
Big phrase, especially here in Japan.

5
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,041
So you're an elder now?

6
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:54,875
"Elder" doesn't necessarily mean old.
It just means older.

7
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,500
As in smarter, wiser.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,125
But hey, I'm serious.
We blow this chance, it's seven years...

9
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,625
Seven years of hard work down the drain.

10
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,916
Ah, so you do listen to me.

11
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:09,666
V…

12
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,791
I haven't missed once in 12 years.

13
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,583
Not gonna miss.

14
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,500
All right. Let's dance.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,625
Oh, one last thing.

16
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:32,416
See? And you say
I only think about the work.

17
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,000
Hi, uh…

18
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,541
No.

19
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,416
Well, never mind, then.

20
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,833
Here, catch!

21
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,416
<i>Seasonal, single male mark.</i>

22
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,333
Copy. Holding at yellow.

23
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,583
<i>Target visible.</i>

24
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,708
<i>Seasonal, the window is open.</i>

25
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,000
<i>You're green.</i>

26
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,958
I've got a protocol breach.

27
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,291
<i>I repeat, you are green.</i>

28
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,291
Code five on-site. Code five.

29
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,000
<i>Overridden. Take the shot.</i>

30
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,250
Hold on. There's a kid here.

31
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,416
<i>The window is closing.</i>
<i>I repeat, take the shot, Seasonal.</i>

32
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,333
Please reconfirm.

33
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,083
<i>I repeat, take the shot.</i>

34
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,375
<i>Seasonal, the window is closing.</i>

35
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,125
<i> I've thought</i>
<i>about this a long time.</i>

36
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,041
<i>I wanna talk retirement.</i>

37
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,875
<i> What happened in Osaka</i>
<i>shouldn't have.</i>

38
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,583
<i>It was wrong.</i>

39
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,250
Nobody knew she'd be there.

40
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,333
We had one rule, V.

41
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,916
One simple rule. No kids.

42
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,916
I know.

43
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,750
I mean, this ain't your first rodeo.

44
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,458
You know there's collateral damage.
You know that.

45
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,708
I can't shake it.

46
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,708
Trust me, I've tried.

47
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,791
Almost to the head of the snake.

48
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,291
Look, I promised
I'd finish the job, and I will.

49
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,541
And then I'm out.

50
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,458
I want a life, V.

51
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,791
You know, I never had one.

52
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,166
A real, regular life.

53
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,458
What does that mean?

54
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,625
I mean, what… Family? Kids?

55
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,208
- Picket fence? Dogs? Suburbs?
- I don't know.

56
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,541
Something like that.

57
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,458
Two trips to Walmart, you'll be back.

58
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,458
It must be killing you.

59
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,083
You haven't even touched your Merlot.

60
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,333
It's Margaux.

61
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,125
I'm sorry, that was a total pick-up line.

62
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,750
Fuck it. I mean, listen.

63
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,416
The worst way
to start a conversation is a "Hey."

64
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,791
It's boring, it's dull. It's for horses.

65
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,916
So anything but that.

66
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,166
I'm Stephen.

67
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,333
Hey.

68
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:32,375
Shibuya-ku Sendagaya 4-7-11.
Shibuya-ku Sendagaya 4-7-11.

69
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,458
Time to leave.

70
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,625
Seasonal, on-site.

71
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,458
<i> Copy.</i>
<i>Stage mark. Northwest corner.</i>

72
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,958
Sector and trajectory?

73
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,541
<i>Main entrance, two black sedans.</i>
<i>Single.</i>

74
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,291
Contact.

75
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,500
Primary win…

76
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,875
<i>Seasonal, repeat.</i>

77
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,500
Window on primary?

78
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,750
<i>Ten seconds, max.</i>

79
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,000
<i>Seasonal, report.</i>

80
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,458
Holding on yellow.

81
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,250
<i>Target visible. You are green.</i>

82
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,000
<i>Window is closed.</i>
<i>Seasonal, report.</i>

83
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,625
- New point.
<i>- Negative. You are red.</i>

84
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,208
- New point.
<i>- The window is closed.</i>

85
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,375
Hey.

86
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,583
Stop, stop. For fuck's sake.

87
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,208
<i> Now you start</i>
<i>the rest of your life</i>

88
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,875
- What's your name?
- Kate.

89
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,666
Kate. I'm Varrick.

90
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,333
<i>I'm your handler now.</i>

91
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:17,333
That makes me your mother,
your father, your best friend,

92
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,125
<i>and your therapist.</i>

93
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,875
Left. That all you got? Left.

94
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,500
Good.

95
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,958
It's good. You're awake.

96
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,083
You've been out almost a day.

97
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,166
Have you had any recent
exposure to radioactive materials?

98
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,166
No.

99
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,958
The reason I ask is you appear to be
suffering from accelerated ARS.

100
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,208
Acute radiation syndrome.

101
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,291
Lethal.

102
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,416
Caused by subjection
to potent radiation in…

103
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,250
Extremely short amount of time.

104
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,458
Which substance?

105
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,000
We looked for the usuals.

106
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,458
Iodine-131, thallium, but uh…

107
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,708
It appears to be more specific.

108
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,041
Polonium-210?

109
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,291
204.

110
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,833
We'll take the Margaux to go.

111
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,416
Please do not try to…

112
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,500
How much time do I have?

113
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,166
A day, maybe.

114
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,416
But we will make it painless for you.

115
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,041
Shit.

116
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,041
It's possible that...

117
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,458
I'll get a nurse.

118
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,916
Five liters of blood in the body,
heart pumps two a minute.

119
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,625
Gun's on your femoral. You do the math.

120
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,958
I need something to keep me going.

121
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,708
I want stimulants.

122
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,166
These. Load them in the shots, go.

123
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,000
Give me five.

124
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,750
- Come on.
- Okay.

125
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,500
I don't have all the time in the world.

126
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,666
What are you trying to do?

127
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,666
Shibuya-ku Sendagaya.
Shibuya-ku Sendagaya.

128
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,166
- …take a shower.
- We should just have fun!

129
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,666
- It's the last night. Come on!
- I know.

130
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,208
But I still have stuff to do.

131
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,916
Oh, my God!

132
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,041
Why'd you poison me?

133
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,916
What are you talking about? Poison?

134
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,833
I didn't know it was…

135
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,291
They told me it was just a roofie,
so they could lift the room.

136
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,458
Who? Who told you?

137
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,416
Even if I knew, I'd be dead if I tell you.

138
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,541
- Aw, she'll be dead if you don't.
- Wait.

139
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,500
Don't.

140
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,708
Sato.

141
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,041
Kazuo Sato. He manages a Yakuza club.

142
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,125
Which clan?

143
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,583
Kijima.

144
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,250
Fuck, it's a Kijima clan.

145
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,583
They've owned us for years.

146
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,875
Sato said that
if he did this one last thing,

147
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,291
that he would set us free.

148
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,958
We could actually start over now.

149
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,333
A different life.

150
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Please.

151
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,791
These might fit you.

152
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,041
Can I get you something?

153
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,500
Anything?

154
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,208
Boom Boom Lemon?

155
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,458
You got any?

156
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,750
Oh, um…

157
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,291
No, sorry.

158
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,041
I'm Kanako.

159
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,958
And it seems we're the same.

160
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,333
Collateral damage.

161
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,666
I'm Kate.

162
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,625
And they're gonna know I was here.

163
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,833
Who?

164
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,708
Everyone.

165
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,500
Poisoned by who?

166
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,500
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

167
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,708
There must be some antidote.

168
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,375
For polonium-204?

169
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,958
Who was the mark, V?

170
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,291
Kate, you know, uh…

171
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:36,916
V?

172
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,416
Who was the mark?

173
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,666
You won't get any more
questions from me after today.

174
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,333
A man named Kijima.

175
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,000
I recognized him from Osaka.

176
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,083
Who is he?

177
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,583
Grand honcho
of the biggest family in Tokyo.

178
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:10,375
Your mark in Osaka
was Kijima's younger brother, Kentaro.

179
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:19,333
I won't lie, it's been a shitshow
for us as it's been for you, and…

180
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:24,458
Kijima, apparently,
who hasn't been able to let it go.

181
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,375
This was revenge for Osaka?

182
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:31,416
Some people have this extraordinary
attachment to their siblings,

183
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,125
as if genetics make a family and…

184
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:43,416
Anyway, all that honor shit,
Kijima's been on a tear against the…

185
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,375
How do I get to him?

186
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,750
Kijima doesn't surface.

187
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,041
Not after Osaka.

188
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:56,000
Last night was a very rare opportunity.

189
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,791
What about Sato? Kazuo Sato. Ring a bell?

190
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:05,750
I know that some of his guys hang out
at a place called the Black Lizard.

191
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:06,958
That's a start.

192
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,166
Go.

193
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,208
You Sato?

194
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:30,125
Kazuo Sato?

195
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:34,333
Who are you? What...

196
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:35,500
Did you poison me?

197
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,708
You don't tell me, I kill you.

198
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:43,083
I think you're lying, I kill you.

199
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,583
Did you poison me?

200
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,500
Yeah.

201
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,500
Why?

202
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:00,833
Hey!

203
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:02,208
Why'd you poison me?

204
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,625
I only follow orders.

205
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:09,041
From Kijima?

206
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,916
Please.

207
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,541
Where is Kijima?

208
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:21,750
How do I get to him?

209
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:23,583
Nobody knows.

210
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,916
All right. Same question, same deal.

211
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
- You killed him! He is the...
- He is dead. You worry about you.

212
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,125
You crazy! I don't know!

213
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,125
I'm gonna ask one more time.

214
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,666
Where is Kijima?

215
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,000
Last chance.

216
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,500
Please. I don't know...

217
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:44,666
Shit!

218
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,916
Ani. Ani-chan would know.

219
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:33,916
Ani?

220
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,625
Hey, stop!

221
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,750
What the fuck are you doing?
Let go of me!

222
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,083
Hey! Stop!

223
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:46,541
Come on. Ow!

224
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,500
- Get up.
<i>- Kuso!</i>

225
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,000
You slapped me!

226
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:54,625
Stop, or I'll… Fuck.

227
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:14,208
Okay, okay, okay.

228
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,875
Next one goes in there.

229
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:20,958
I'm sorry.

230
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,583
You're gonna call Kijima for me.

231
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,000
What?

232
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,208
Kijima. Call him.

233
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:33,083
I can't. I don't have his number.

234
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,875
Oh, you don't have his number? Really?

235
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,708
Kijima, yeah, I don't have his number!

236
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38,791
- How do you reach him?
- Okay, who are you?

237
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,833
How do you get in touch with him?

238
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,708
I don't know, I just call <i>ano baka </i>Renji.

239
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:46,750
Renji?

240
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:54,541
The only person that talks to him.

241
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,541
Okay. Call Renji.

242
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,750
<i> Hai, Shinzo.</i>

243
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:28,083
<i> Ani?</i>

244
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,666
I got the kid.
If Kijima wants to see her again,

245
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,791
he can meet me at the center
of Murakawa marketplace in one hour.

246
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:40,250
- A second more and she dies.
<i>- Who is this?</i>

247
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:48,458
You're crazy.

248
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:50,750
You wanna get Kijima?

249
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,666
You think you can…
You can't get to him this way.

250
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,416
He doesn't give a shit about me.

251
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:01,708
No one does.

252
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,583
Come on.

253
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:21,041
Huh?

254
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:18,541
And you know,
for your information,

255
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:21,791
I haven't talked
or seen my uncle in, like, a year.

256
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:30,250
Shit.

257
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:34,583
Ew, what the fuck?
Oh, my God, what is wrong with you?

258
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:35,666
Sit down.

259
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,250
I said, sit down!

260
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,708
Yeah, no way. You're all gross and sick.

261
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:42,833
And you know what?

262
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,291
Fuck you, cancer bitch.

263
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,750
Hey, I have to go to the bathroom.

264
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:13,500
Me, too. Come on.

265
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:18,416
Ouch.

266
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,750
Hey.

267
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,666
You got any Boom Boom Lemon?

268
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,375
Well, this sucks.

269
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,125
Ugh! I can barely breathe in here.

270
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,708
No way.

271
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:36,958
So many scars and blood. It's so…

272
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:38,666
It's gross, I know.

273
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,416
No, no, no.

274
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,375
I think it's awesome.

275
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,541
Ow!

276
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:28,125
What the fuck are you doing, bitch?

277
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:37,125
This will keep you safe. Trust me.

278
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:13,916
<i>Hai.</i>

279
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,583
- <i>Dozo.</i>
<i>- Arrigato.</i>

280
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:14,291
Where is Ani-chan?

281
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,375
I don't see Kijima.

282
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:24,708
Let me see the child first.

283
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,750
Either Kijima walks out right now,

284
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:30,500
or I leave
and you never see the kid alive again.

285
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,916
Boo!

286
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:40,750
Stupid shit!

287
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,250
Ani.

288
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,541
Shinzo.

289
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:54,791
Oh, my God.

290
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:07,916
- You better get out of here.
- Wait!

291
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,875
Hey.

292
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:13,958
Hey. Where are we going?

293
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,750
Stop following me. Stop.

294
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:23,791
You're just gonna leave me, then?

295
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:25,916
Kijima didn't show.
You're useless to me now.

296
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:29,208
Did you see what just happened?

297
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:32,291
My own family wants me gone.
Where the fuck will I go?

298
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:34,458
Not my problem.

299
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,916
I'll be dead before the night's over.

300
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,416
Hey, that makes two of us.

301
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:41,375
Why did you save me, then, huh?

302
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:42,875
You're making me regret it!

303
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:46,666
You… you're a… No!
You can't abandon me.

304
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:50,458
I know Kijima killed my dad,
and he will kill me.

305
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:52,583
What did I do wrong, huh?

306
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:57,708
I haven't done anything to anybody,
but they still treat me like shit!

307
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:08,000
Everybody, all the time,
just throwing me around,

308
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:11,208
like I'm some piece of garbage.

309
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:12,291
Shut up!

310
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:14,541
You don't know what you're talking about.

311
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:17,166
You just yap, yap, yap.
Just "fuck this, fuck that."

312
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,583
You don't know anything! You're a kid!

313
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,041
Medicine. Dropped it.

314
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:43,708
What's wrong with you?

315
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,375
I'm dying.

316
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:04,958
Kijima did this, right?

317
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,541
Are you gonna go kill him?

318
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,291
You're a badass killer motherfucker.

319
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:25,708
You'll need me, you know. Like…

320
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,750
Just look at you. You…

321
00:47:30,416 --> 00:47:32,791
You won't make it an hour
without my help, okay?

322
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:38,333
And I can do everything, okay?

323
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,208
I know who, where, when, whatever.

324
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:42,375
- I can help you get him, get my uncle.
- Okay.

325
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:46,333
And I'm really good
at shortcuts and maps and…

326
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:50,208
What?

327
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,083
I said okay.

328
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:54,250
Okay.

329
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:11,166
Um…

330
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:14,208
You can't walk around like this.

331
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:24,500
Sold out.

332
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:27,625
Boom Boom Lemon?
Artificial shit.

333
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:30,875
You know what? This is stupid. Let's go.

334
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:33,291
Yeah, clean clothes are stupid.

335
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:36,250
"Everything I should wear
should be just covered in blood."

336
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:40,333
Aw, it's so cute on you.

337
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:47,125
Come on.

338
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:52,375
You're so cool.

339
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:55,416
But you're also a Terminator, bitch.

340
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,708
- Oh, my God.
- "I die."

341
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:05,750
Seriously, we're…

342
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:08,625
We're actually pretty much the same.

343
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:10,875
It's scary.

344
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:16,083
Who has a line into Kijima?

345
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:18,125
Only Renji. I told you.

346
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:19,333
His main advisor.

347
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,041
That was my dad's job.

348
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:26,791
But he got shot.

349
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:29,333
Kijima did it, I'm sure.

350
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:31,750
And Renji was there, too.

351
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:36,208
How do I find Renji?

352
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:39,583
Um, probably with his <i>aijin.</i>

353
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:40,708
His what?

354
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,000
His boyfriend, Jojima.

355
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,541
- Tell me where.
- Mmm.

356
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:50,166
It's this fucking cool penthouse,
top of the tower.

357
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,833
- The entire floor is theirs.
- Security?

358
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:57,125
I mean, two in the lobby, at least.

359
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:01,000
- Service entrance?
- Yeah.

360
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,958
The back, by the kitchen.

361
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:07,375
We could just shoot our ways in.

362
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:10,291
And risk Renji escaping?

363
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:13,166
No. I have to get to him
before he knows what's wrong.

364
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:17,125
- We'll be fast, okay? Bang, bang! Brrap!
- "You're dead..."

365
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:20,750
Stop. Speak less, open your ears.

366
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,625
We're gonna distract them.

367
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:28,208
<i>You're</i> going to distract them.

368
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:31,666
How?

369
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,375
By being you. Just, you know, louder.

370
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:37,791
Okay, cool. So…

371
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:39,875
Can I have a gun?

372
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:41,125
No.

373
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:54,000
Ani-chan?

374
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:11,583
Where's Renji?

375
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:14,916
What do you want from Renji-san?

376
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,208
It's not your concern.

377
00:52:19,291 --> 00:52:22,166
Of course it is my concern.

378
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,666
Your concern is to stay whole
until I leave here.

379
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:29,083
Renji?

380
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:34,041
You may do to me what you must.

381
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,541
But I will not be
disclosing his whereabouts.

382
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:43,791
Shut the blinds.

383
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:52,041
Shit, there's one remote for everything.

384
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:10,791
Shit, shit.

385
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:49,416
Stop, Jojima!

386
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:51,000
Back off!

387
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,625
<i>Konoyaro! </i>Stop it!

388
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,125
You motherfucker!

389
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:08,500
Stop it!

390
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:15,583
Fuck. I'm sorry. Fuck.

391
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:46,250
There's blood on my…

392
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:48,041
There's blood…

393
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:50,583
There's blood on my face. There's blood.

394
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:03,750
Hey.

395
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:05,083
Hey, hey.

396
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:08,708
Come on. Come here.

397
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:13,416
- No. No, stop it. Stop it! Stop!
- Hey. Look at me.

398
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:21,083
Look only at me, okay?
Look only at me and breathe.

399
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:24,041
Breathe.

400
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,500
Breathe.

401
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:30,250
Okay? You're gonna live through this.

402
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:32,125
Okay?

403
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:33,625
All right? You're doing great.

404
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:35,583
Okay?

405
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:38,083
Come here.

406
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:40,166
Come here.

407
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,083
Hey, maybe we should
check this house, huh?

408
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:55,333
Maybe there's some, uh…

409
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:57,750
- Clues?
- Clues. Yeah.

410
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:38,291
Bingo.

411
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:41,041
- Hey, I think I know where Renji is.
- Yeah?

412
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:45,250
Check this out.

413
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,416
Cellular tracking.

414
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:52,208
I can see exactly where Renji is
and where he will be.

415
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:55,291
That's very good.

416
00:57:57,916 --> 00:57:59,000
"Useless."

417
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:25,958
Ani?

418
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:29,333
Bang!

419
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:32,791
Bang!

420
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:51,875
Hey, Renji.

421
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:56,291
I gotta be honest,
I'm having a rough night.

422
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:59,708
I really need to see your boss Kijima.

423
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:03,458
Speak English, motherfucker.

424
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:07,583
English, I said.

425
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:18,833
<i>Wakatta. Wakatta.</i>

426
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:21,750
<i>Fuzakenna.</i>

427
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:24,166
Family killed my father.

428
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,666
Family tried to kill me.

429
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,083
All of you asshole hyenas
getting fat off of my dad's carcass!

430
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:43,291
Look.

431
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:47,041
Just give him to me,
and you'll live. Okay?

432
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:49,291
I do not know.

433
00:59:50,375 --> 00:59:54,458
When he disappears like this,
he says, "To be amongst family."

434
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:57,166
I don't know what it means.

435
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,458
I know where he is.

436
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,500
Your phone.

437
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:28,375
<i> I found him. I found Kijima.</i>

438
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,708
I'm gonna finish it, V.

439
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:33,666
<i>Hey, I promised you, didn't I?</i>

440
01:00:34,166 --> 01:00:37,208
Kate, tell me where you are,
I'll come to you right now.

441
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:38,291
Let me help you.

442
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:39,875
<i>Don't. I'll already be dead anyway.</i>

443
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,916
You can find my body
near a house in Hottazaka.

444
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:49,875
<i>In the hills.</i>

445
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,250
Goodbye, V.

446
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:03,750
Kate?

447
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,291
Does that hurt?

448
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:46,000
When you do that.

449
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,666
No more questions.

450
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:58,500
I don't know anything about you.

451
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,125
Don't need to.

452
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,625
Do you wanna know about me?

453
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,458
I know enough.

454
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,750
But I'm the last person
you'll get to know.

455
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,458
You don't wanna know me?

456
01:02:23,541 --> 01:02:24,958
That's sad, Kate.

457
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:27,500
I think that's really…

458
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,958
It's sad.

459
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,666
My mom's a <i>gaijin,</i> too.

460
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:48,583
That's why I've never met her.

461
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,500
Never even seen a picture.

462
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:53,500
They won't… I…

463
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:55,875
I don't know what she looks like.

464
01:03:03,666 --> 01:03:05,250
She was like you, I bet.

465
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:10,041
Tall and… pretty.

466
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:15,250
No shit from no dudes.
Just doing what she wants all the time.

467
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:18,583
Total killer babe.

468
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:22,083
Killer babe.

469
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:25,458
It's the old family house.
No one really knows about it.

470
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,583
Where they all grew up.

471
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:29,375
The elders and shit.

472
01:04:33,166 --> 01:04:34,166
My dad, too.

473
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:48,666
Go on.

474
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:50,375
I'll finish this.

475
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,250
What? You'll finish it?

476
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,791
Hey, look at you.
You can't stand, and you can't see.

477
01:04:57,541 --> 01:04:58,708
Okay? You're gonna die.

478
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:00,541
Yeah, after I kill him.

479
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,666
- I'm here now. I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

480
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,333
Why not? I go where you go.

481
01:05:09,416 --> 01:05:10,958
Because you're a fucking kid.

482
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:13,708
Go be one.

483
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:16,208
I never could.

484
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:19,791
Hey, Ani…

485
01:05:22,791 --> 01:05:23,791
You're young.

486
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:27,041
You have time to forget.

487
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,375
Be someone less angry.

488
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,666
Take control of your own life.

489
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,250
Go.

490
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,208
Look at me.

491
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:53,541
Yeah. I'm dying.

492
01:08:38,416 --> 01:08:40,958
Kentaro, your brother…

493
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:07,875
Renji.

494
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:01,166
Hi.

495
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,083
Get lost.

496
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:05,625
Yeah.

497
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:10,666
You know, I thought
I had the coolest bracelets.

498
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,666
I realize now,
you have the coolest bracelet.

499
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:16,791
I have a gun, you know.

500
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:18,791
Well, good for you.

501
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:21,375
Your parents raised you right.

502
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:23,666
Yeah, you don't know
shit about my parents,

503
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:24,958
so just fuck off.

504
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:28,208
Well, I know it couldn't
have been easy to lose 'em.

505
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:33,791
You know,
I lost someone that I love a lot.

506
01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:35,666
And you know her.

507
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:40,208
Kate?

508
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:44,500
Maybe my best friend.

509
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:46,416
And, uh…

510
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:51,875
I'm very worried about her.

511
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:53,458
"Friends."

512
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,625
I didn't know Kate had any stupid friends.

513
01:10:57,208 --> 01:10:58,875
Well, she's got you, doesn't she?

514
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:02,500
But you're right.

515
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:06,583
She and I
aren't really friends, more family.

516
01:11:25,666 --> 01:11:27,416
No, but Varrick, he's… he's…

517
01:12:05,416 --> 01:12:11,666
Have you ever wondered
about Kate's obsession with your family?

518
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:14,666
You mean my uncle?

519
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:18,125
Yeah, sure. Him, too.

520
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:21,416
Sorry.

521
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:26,375
I know you've been through a lot.

522
01:12:27,875 --> 01:12:29,000
What do you mean?

523
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:37,666
Kate ever share with you what she did
in Osaka when she first met you?

524
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:10,458
I have to finish this.

525
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:15,416
I'm dying. I have to finish…
I have to finish something.

526
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:21,791
Death is the time for the beginnings.

527
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:16,541
No, no, no.

528
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:19,125
No, Ani. Ani, no…

529
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:21,083
You lied to me!

530
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,708
I killed someone for you.

531
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:27,375
- Ani...
- You killed my whole family.

532
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,833
You… You bitch!

533
01:14:29,916 --> 01:14:31,166
No, please.

534
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,875
Shoot me if you want,
but don't get in that car, okay?

535
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:36,208
Look at me. I'm begging you.

536
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:41,125
You're stronger than I am.
You don't have to end up here...

537
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Shut the fuck up!
I have nothing left, okay?
It's what they do.
You and me, we're collateral...

538
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:24,750
Now what?

539
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:27,416
Now…

540
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:30,666
You start the rest of your life.

541
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:39,166
<i> You start the rest of your life.</i>

542
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:43,916
I know how much you must be
hurting right now, losing your parents.

543
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,625
<i>But it's gonna be okay.</i>

544
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,458
<i>I repeat, take the shot.</i>

545
01:15:50,541 --> 01:15:52,458
<i> The gun was empty.</i>

546
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:54,250
It's empty!

547
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:56,583
I know.

548
01:15:57,833 --> 01:16:00,875
Shoot 'em in the stomach,
they die slow, in agony.

549
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:03,333
And they know it's personal.

550
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:04,416
Let's go.

551
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,041
Breathe.

552
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:08,250
<i>Breathe.</i>

553
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:10,833
<i> Are you gonna</i>
<i>let that pain overwhelm you?</i>

554
01:16:13,833 --> 01:16:15,625
<i>Control you?</i>

555
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,041
<i> This is so cool.</i>

556
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,208
Maybe you can embrace it.

557
01:16:23,416 --> 01:16:25,583
<i>And let it empower you.</i>

558
01:17:32,416 --> 01:17:33,333
Renji?

559
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:35,333
What is she doing here?

560
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:39,166
She's the future. Mine at least.

561
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:41,083
Ani, sit.

562
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:52,958
You went after my girl
without my permission.

563
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:56,083
I could fucking kill you right now.

564
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:00,625
And destroy your own operation?

565
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:03,916
My issue is not with my operation.

566
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,916
It's with you taking it on yourself.

567
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,125
You ordered her termination.

568
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:12,666
"If she's leaving, I will terminate her."

569
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:15,125
Your words exactly.

570
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:20,208
"If."

571
01:18:20,916 --> 01:18:21,958
I said "if."

572
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,750
Key word, "if."

573
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,291
She was coming back.

574
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,125
I just had to work it.

575
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:33,250
I was working it.

576
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:37,083
She would have changed her mind.

577
01:18:37,166 --> 01:18:38,916
I would have changed my mind.

578
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:43,958
Polonium-204?

579
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:46,291
Fuck you!

580
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:56,916
Your girl had to die.

581
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,416
That was always the deal, Varrick-san.

582
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:03,125
After Kentaro's death,
all eyes were on me.

583
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:07,541
I panicked.
I moved too quickly, and I'm sorry.

584
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:26,333
Yeah.

585
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:29,583
You know what? You blundered, I blundered.

586
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:32,041
Let's, uh…

587
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:36,500
Maybe we do our best
to put this behind us.

588
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,333
In the name of being human.

589
01:19:40,583 --> 01:19:42,083
I prefer self-interest.

590
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:44,458
I trust it more.

591
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:51,750
I can't say I can trust you going forward.

592
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:55,375
Trust was not a part of the deal.

593
01:19:57,875 --> 01:19:58,916
Neither is friendship.

594
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:02,750
Welcome to the Yakuza, Varrick-san.

595
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Not tonight.

596
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:33,666
Boom Boom Lemon?

597
01:21:58,375 --> 01:21:59,666
Let's go get Ani.

598
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,416
<i> Alpha-six,</i>
<i>camera two is down.</i>

599
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,958
<i>I repeat, camera two is down.</i>

600
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:29,375
<i>Four to Alpha-six.</i>

601
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:30,958
So what do we do?

602
01:23:31,041 --> 01:23:35,583
Well, we, uh, call up the teams,
form a barricade around the crystal box.

603
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:37,041
Bring up the kid.

604
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:40,291
And, uh, you know,
we'll hole up in there. Move!

605
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:41,625
Which teams, sir?

606
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:43,541
All of 'em!

607
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:57,166
Go, go, go!

608
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:02,333
Uh-oh.

609
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:04,416
Asshole.

610
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,625
- <i>Bring up the girl.</i>
- Copy that.

611
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:08,750
Let's go. Move!

612
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:10,166
Hey! Easy, cowboy.

613
01:25:06,541 --> 01:25:07,375
Fuck!

614
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:19,166
Okay, Renji. You ain't coming with.

615
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:23,625
You take care of Kijima.

616
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:25,291
You guys, stay with him.

617
01:26:25,833 --> 01:26:27,666
You guys, come with me. Good luck.

618
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,333
Eh?

619
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:05,458
Eh?

620
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:37,125
Bravo, Kate.

621
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:40,166
Never doubted you.

622
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:42,208
Ani…

623
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:44,166
I'm sor...

624
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:46,708
Ani, I'm sorry.

625
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:53,708
I'd do anything…

626
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,041
To undo it, to take it all back.

627
01:30:58,125 --> 01:31:00,750
Can't go back, sadly.

628
01:31:01,375 --> 01:31:02,291
Please.

629
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:04,875
Be nice, right now,
for both of us, wouldn't it?

630
01:31:04,958 --> 01:31:08,625
Ani, I'd give anything to take it back.
I'd take it all back. I'm so sorry.

631
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:12,166
But guess we gotta just accept
who we are now.

632
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,541
And you know, Kate, that we are…

633
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:16,541
Tools.

634
01:31:18,208 --> 01:31:22,041
Well, I was gonna say
"indispensable parts of a system."

635
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:24,291
That you created and controlled.

636
01:31:25,208 --> 01:31:27,208
A necessary system, Kate.

637
01:31:27,291 --> 01:31:30,041
One that cannot accommodate dissent.

638
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:37,750
I promise you
it is not what you think it is.

639
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,958
It turns out nothing ever was.

640
01:31:42,916 --> 01:31:44,750
And I'm not looking away anymore.

641
01:31:49,708 --> 01:31:51,000
Oh.

642
01:31:54,416 --> 01:31:58,291
I see. In the 25th hour,
you suddenly grew a conscience.

643
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:01,333
Don't do this, Varrick.

644
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:03,291
Don't you do this, Kate.

645
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:07,916
My entire fucking life,
I never loved anyone, except you.

646
01:32:09,041 --> 01:32:10,291
Come on, V.

647
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:14,125
We both know you only love yourself.

648
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:22,208
Life had such…

649
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:25,875
Big things waiting for you.

650
01:32:28,208 --> 01:32:29,791
My life wasn't mine.

651
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:33,541
Till now.

652
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:57,708
It's okay. It's okay. Go on. Okay.

653
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:18,083
Great shot.

654
01:33:55,833 --> 01:33:57,000
I got you.

655
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:30,583
Hey, hey.

656
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:33,083
Yeah. It's okay.

657
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:36,583
I know you.

658
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:57,208
No, no, no.

659
01:35:30,041 --> 01:35:32,125
It's okay.
