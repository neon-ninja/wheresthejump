1
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:42,950
Come on, it wasn't so bad.

2
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:51,704
- What was that?
- Please remind me, never to go out with you.

3
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:56,291
- Fine, you don't have to.
- I won't.

4
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:00,917
Shut up! Stop laughing,
it's not funny.

5
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:03,872
- Are you okay?
- No.

6
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,493
Stupid shoes.

7
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:09,501
The fuck are you looking at?

8
00:01:09,865 --> 00:01:12,789
But seriously, I've never seen
so many douchebags in one place.

9
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:16,707
- I don't know, that tall one was kinda hot.
- The Marilyn Manson?

10
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:18,742
- Hot!
- Gross!

11
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:22,038
- You take this, I'll take the next one.
- You little freak.

12
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,872
- You're gonna go back in there, aren't you?
- Huh, no.

13
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:26,871
- Whatever.
- No.

14
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,914
- Bye, Judy.
- Bye, Stephanie.

15
00:01:34,948 --> 00:01:38,077
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You look so pretty.

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,323
- I had to just to scare you a little bit.
- Don't touch me.

17
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:43,830
I'm just trying to say hello,
you have such a pretty dress on.

18
00:01:43,948 --> 00:01:47,828
Check it out, check it out...
We got a limo, we got weed, champagne.

19
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:50,121
<i>Just come hang with us.
Leave her alone.</i>

20
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:52,534
Why are you in a such a bad mood?

21
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:55,622
Can I have a cigarette at least?
Or something, a smile?

22
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,500
Fuck off.

23
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:00,621
She just threw a cigarette at me.

24
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:02,750
Bad vibe, bro.

25
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:05,626
- Not very nice.
- Not very nice.

26
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,034
Hi! Can you-

27
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:17,580
The fuck?!

28
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,626
<i>I see you too.</i>

29
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:38,160
That late and still out?

30
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:41,873
Better go home.

31
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:46,125
Oh, fuck.

32
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:55,955
<i>Okay.</i>

33
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:59,167
<i>I know where you live, Judy.</i>

34
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,242
<i>See you later.</i>

35
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,871
Yeah, I just got home.

36
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:49,667
God, I'm glad that's over.

37
00:04:50,782 --> 00:04:51,908
I know.

38
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,289
It was just some old truck driver.

39
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,625
Yeah.

40
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:11,209
Ugh no, I didn't.
I just...

41
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:14,956
No, it freaked me out.

42
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,913
I know.

43
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:20,118
Yeah well, I blame you.

44
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:23,035
The stupid places you take me to.

45
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,950
Oh crap.

46
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:27,080
The lights are out on my floor.

47
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,250
Ok, bye.

48
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,243
- Where'd you park the car?
- It's downstairs.

49
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:46,873
- You got the address?
- Yeah. You better hurry, we're gonna be late.

50
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:22,034
Please don't scream.

51
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
You're so beautiful.

52
00:06:54,657 --> 00:07:01,791
MANIAC

53
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,084
Hello, Redlucie86.

54
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:57,872
<i>Truly timid?</i>

55
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:03,542
It's my first time on a dating site.

56
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:18,032
There's a reason
I'm called timid man.

57
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:26,284
Picture...

58
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:20,043
That sounds lovely.

59
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:22,917
Why didn't you agree?

60
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:25,285
Of course I have.

61
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:29,792
- Lucie?
- Frank.

62
00:09:29,907 --> 00:09:32,786
- Hi.
- Hi. It's very nice to meet you.

63
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:35,330
No charm, I'm sure.

64
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:42,874
- You are totally not what I imagined.
- Really? What did you imagine?

65
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:47,453
Umm, like fat, with long black hair

66
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:50,915
and just greasy skin full of acne.

67
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:53,000
Huh, you should've seen the other photo
I was going to send you.

68
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:56,707
I mean people always post
the best pictures of themselves

69
00:09:56,865 --> 00:09:59,664
and then that's what something
is like when you meet them.

70
00:10:00,073 --> 00:10:02,917
I ordered some wine.
I hope you don't mind.

71
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:05,706
No, I like a man
who takes control.

72
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:07,958
Thank you.

73
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

74
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:19,998
So, how long have you been using
the website?

75
00:10:20,157 --> 00:10:22,251
Uhh, like six months, maybe?

76
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:25,076
But this is my first dinner date,
usually it's just for drinks.

77
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,663
Although I can already tell that
you are a breath of fresh air

78
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:30,417
for the jugheads I deal
with at the bar every night, ugh.

79
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:34,749
See, it's really easy to get over
with the testosterone at work, you know?

80
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:36,625
Yeah.

81
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:45,456
So, why don't you have
a girlfriend?

82
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:49,705
- I...
- Are you okay?

83
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:52,209
I just...

84
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:10,667
Frank, are you okay?

85
00:11:12,823 --> 00:11:15,246
You look pale.

86
00:11:18,865 --> 00:11:21,038
Is everything okay?

87
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,913
Well, excuse me, I-

88
00:11:24,073 --> 00:11:26,622
I need to find the restroom.

89
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:07,162
Did that waiter even look Indian to you?
I think he looked more Mexican.

90
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:11,660
He was such a tool.

91
00:12:13,823 --> 00:12:15,621
You know, it was really sweet
of you to drive me home.

92
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:18,909
I'm happy to do it.

93
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,831
I had a very lovely evening.

94
00:12:23,698 --> 00:12:27,532
Did you wanna come up
for a drink?

95
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:29,245
Are you sure?

96
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:33,824
Uh, like I said -
begging really isn't my thing, so...

97
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:36,542
Right. Okay then.

98
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:38,162
Sounds nice.

99
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:41,416
So what's all that stuff
back there?

100
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:44,160
I thought you were a journalist
or something.

101
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:46,451
It's for a fashion shoot.

102
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:48,913
I'm just doing a favor
for a friend.

103
00:12:50,115 --> 00:12:52,163
So where do you live, Frank?

104
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:55,911
Probably in some trendy loft
or something.

105
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:58,997
I mean my place isn't much
but it's all mine, so...

106
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:01,080
I'm done with roommates.

107
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:04,706
No, thank you.
I still have to drive home.

108
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:07,200
Yeah, but not now, right?

109
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:10,957
You should take off your coat
and stay for a little while.

110
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:15,167
Want me to put on some music?

111
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,869
I love this song.
Dance with me.

112
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:34,746
I think you're cute.

113
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:39,498
I'm gonna be right back.
You don't go anywhere.

114
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:02,667
You take a lot
of pictures of yourself.

115
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,083
Hi...

116
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:18,206
I wanted to slip into something
a little more comfortable.

117
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:25,001
So how about that coat?

118
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,959
Now it's your turn to do me.

119
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,619
Why... Why are you hiding?

120
00:14:49,782 --> 00:14:51,455
I don't know.

121
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:53,117
They're little.

122
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:58,911
What do you think?
You wanna touch them?

123
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:02,198
You shouldn't be so scared,
timid man.

124
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:06,538
Your hands feel warm.

125
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,870
Squeeze them.

126
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:14,621
You can do it harder.

127
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:22,868
You wanna get rough playing?

128
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,539
Is that what you're into?

129
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:29,163
Are you gonna fuck me?

130
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:33,410
I can't. I can't.

131
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:36,871
Don't be a pussy.

132
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:48,746
You like it?

133
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:53,949
I like to keep the lights on too.

134
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,789
Don't be so horrified.

135
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:06,160
You just relax.

136
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,709
Why can't you leave them alone?

137
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:30,832
Why can't you leave any
of them alone?

138
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:34,125
Can I have just one

139
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:36,831
without you getting in the way?

140
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,583
Now look...

141
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,959
Look what you made me do.

142
00:17:41,115 --> 00:17:43,743
Look what you made me do!

143
00:17:44,657 --> 00:17:48,412
I hate you.

144
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:50,784
I hate you.

145
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:53,535
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

146
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,621
I'll make it better.

147
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:58,331
I'll make it all better now.

148
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:25,993
Sorry I missed you today.

149
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:28,956
I have a surprise for you.

150
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:34,334
Are you asleep already?

151
00:19:36,532 --> 00:19:39,706
I'm sorry but I just can't wait.

152
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:42,291
Alright.

153
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,242
Take a look.

154
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:51,993
I saved the best for last.

155
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:04,413
Here we go.

156
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:07,209
Oh, that's nice.

157
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:11,826
Perfect fit, right?

158
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:17,494
Okay now, this might
sting a little.

159
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:20,996
Okay, good.

160
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:23,330
Good.

161
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:25,416
Just one more...

162
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:29,583
Perfect.

163
00:20:30,073 --> 00:20:31,541
Perfect.

164
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:34,659
Meet Redlucie86.

165
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:37,869
Redlucie 86,
this is my girlfriend.

166
00:20:38,198 --> 00:20:40,826
I know the two of you will
get along just fine.

167
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,288
Don't worry.

168
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:48,126
It's fine, it's fine.

169
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:52,042
What?
She's beautiful.

170
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:55,205
Why are you ignoring me, huh?

171
00:20:57,615 --> 00:20:58,867
No, wait...

172
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:00,916
This is impossible.

173
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:02,374
No!

174
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:05,163
Why are you doing this to me?

175
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:07,284
What? You too?

176
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:09,291
Why?

177
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:17,120
You're just like her!
You two are the same thing as her!

178
00:21:18,323 --> 00:21:20,121
Why are you doing this?

179
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:22,117
Why?

180
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:03,120
Hey.

181
00:24:03,948 --> 00:24:05,950
I'm sorry to disturb you, uhm...

182
00:24:06,115 --> 00:24:09,915
I was just taking pictures
of your mannequins in the window.

183
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,080
I hope that's okay?

184
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:14,367
- It's fine, I guess.
- Yeah?

185
00:24:14,698 --> 00:24:18,248
Do you mind if I take pictures of them
with the gate open?

186
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:20,246
Okay, sure.

187
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:23,039
Yeah? Cool, thank you.

188
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:28,787
- What's this for?
- Oh, it's just fine art, I guess.

189
00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:32,704
Here, take a look.

190
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:35,160
- Is that French? Your accent?
- Oui.

191
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:37,455
You have a good ear.

192
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:44,578
- What do you do exactly?
- I take pictures of mannequins.

193
00:24:44,907 --> 00:24:48,411
I try to bring them
to life with light.

194
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,330
Okay, cool. Thank you.

195
00:24:55,573 --> 00:24:57,871
Sorry to have disturbed you.

196
00:24:58,032 --> 00:25:00,126
I'm not usually opened on weekends.

197
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:03,081
Well, thank you
for opening up for me.

198
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,537
Bye.

199
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:06,700
Would you like to see my work?

200
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:10,830
What do you do?

201
00:25:11,365 --> 00:25:13,038
Are you an artist?

202
00:25:13,198 --> 00:25:14,871
I don't know about all that.

203
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:18,285
Come in, maybe you can tell me.

204
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:32,242
It's amazing.

205
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,959
They're from all styles and eras.

206
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:37,664
I've restored most of them myself.

207
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:50,330
She's beautiful.

208
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:53,950
I love her.

209
00:26:02,532 --> 00:26:05,456
- What year is this from?
- Thirties.

210
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:09,243
She's in great condition.

211
00:26:11,532 --> 00:26:12,784
You know what...

212
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:16,703
I'm having a show for my photos
in a gallery downtown.

213
00:26:17,448 --> 00:26:20,998
Maybe I could use some of your
mannequins for my photoshoot.

214
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,118
That would be incredible, I mean...

215
00:26:24,782 --> 00:26:28,412
They're so much more unique than
the ones I've been shooting with.

216
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:31,451
- Is this your place?
- Yes.

217
00:26:31,615 --> 00:26:34,539
- You bought it?
- It was my family's.

218
00:26:34,698 --> 00:26:37,497
Been restoring them
for three generations.

219
00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:44,080
Who's Angela?

220
00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:48,868
The name on the sign.

221
00:26:49,115 --> 00:26:52,665
It was my mother.
She gone.

222
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:54,871
I'm sorry.

223
00:27:01,157 --> 00:27:04,331
- Do you live here?
- Thank you for coming.

224
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,035
Sorry, I'm a little nosey.

225
00:27:08,198 --> 00:27:11,372
I mean this place is so special.

226
00:27:15,282 --> 00:27:17,410
So what do you think
if I rent them?

227
00:27:17,573 --> 00:27:19,541
Uh, I'm not sure...

228
00:27:19,698 --> 00:27:22,326
I usually try to find permanent
homes for them.

229
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,001
You're funny.

230
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:28,535
Well, I can adopt them.

231
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:30,700
What about that?

232
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,038
I'll give you my number.

233
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:43,784
So if you change your mind,
I promise to have them home before midnight.

234
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:49,789
I can be a good mother.

235
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,413
- My name's Anna.
- Thank you.

236
00:27:57,615 --> 00:27:59,538
Call me, please.

237
00:28:03,407 --> 00:28:05,330
Oh and by the way...

238
00:28:06,115 --> 00:28:08,459
You have lipstick on your face.

239
00:28:11,115 --> 00:28:13,288
Have a great day.

240
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,288
Oh no. No, no, no.

241
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:48,371
No. Get out.

242
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:50,200
Get out.

243
00:28:58,032 --> 00:28:59,284
Get out.

244
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,246
Get out. Go.

245
00:29:03,657 --> 00:29:05,204
Go.

246
00:29:06,365 --> 00:29:08,083
That's disgusting.

247
00:31:13,865 --> 00:31:16,038
- Move it!
- I'm just waiting for my wife.

248
00:31:16,198 --> 00:31:19,077
You have ten seconds
before I give you a sanitation.

249
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,584
Let's go.
Come on, let's go!

250
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,163
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

251
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,284
I got my stuff.

252
00:33:14,657 --> 00:33:16,910
Ugh, can you turn this on?

253
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- I'm sorry!
- Shit, you scared me!
I forgot my tights.

254
00:34:18,448 --> 00:34:21,167
- Hey, do you mind waiting for me, please?
- Sure, yeah.

255
00:34:21,282 --> 00:34:22,454
Thanks.

256
00:34:23,115 --> 00:34:25,493
I can't believe you shoved me in my locker.

257
00:34:25,657 --> 00:34:27,330
Don't be tight.

258
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,663
- It was just a joke.
- Come on...

259
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,492
I could've broke my ankle.

260
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:34,993
- It still hurts.
- You're such a prick.

261
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,323
- But seriously.
- Tough it up.

262
00:34:40,698 --> 00:34:44,157
- Come on girl, just come out with us.
- One drink.

263
00:34:44,323 --> 00:34:45,916
- No.
- Come on, hun.

264
00:34:46,115 --> 00:34:48,618
- Why don't you wanna come out?
- I'm going home.

265
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:51,410
- You never come out with us.
- What's up with that?

266
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:53,000
- The car's right up there.
- No way.

267
00:34:56,573 --> 00:34:59,702
- You guys, I think I really hurt
my leg bad today. - Really?

268
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:02,209
- How?
- I went so fast with that twitch at.

269
00:35:02,365 --> 00:35:03,742
I really don't think those tights
are any better.

270
00:35:05,073 --> 00:35:06,825
- Good night, girls.
- Good night.

271
00:35:07,032 --> 00:35:09,034
- Get home safe.
- Bye.

272
00:35:09,198 --> 00:35:12,202
Text me, let me know.
Good night.

273
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:36,291
Oh, fuck.

274
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,913
- You're so beautiful.
- Shit.

275
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:44,454
Oh, shit.

276
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:58,833
What the fuck?!

277
00:36:59,365 --> 00:37:01,459
Leave me the fuck alone!

278
00:37:06,282 --> 00:37:08,284
Get away from me.

279
00:37:09,865 --> 00:37:11,833
Somebody! Help me!

280
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,867
What the fuck?
Where is everyone?

281
00:37:16,073 --> 00:37:17,916
Please, help me!

282
00:37:28,615 --> 00:37:30,788
Please! Help me.

283
00:37:48,198 --> 00:37:49,825
Help me!

284
00:37:54,073 --> 00:37:57,247
Somebody! Open it!

285
00:37:58,407 --> 00:37:59,909
Please!

286
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:02,537
Hey!

287
00:38:08,782 --> 00:38:10,500
Please.

288
00:38:15,907 --> 00:38:18,205
Open the gate, come on!

289
00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:48,575
Oh fuck.

290
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,367
No, no.

291
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,663
Shit.
Oh, shit.

292
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:55,291
Fuck!

293
00:38:57,823 --> 00:38:59,666
Oh, fuck.

294
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

295
00:39:12,448 --> 00:39:14,450
No! No!

296
00:39:22,198 --> 00:39:23,791
Please!

297
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,663
No!

298
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,159
Please.

299
00:39:32,865 --> 00:39:34,492
No!

300
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,995
No!

301
00:40:41,282 --> 00:40:44,286
Stop looking at me,
focus on your work.

302
00:40:44,573 --> 00:40:48,578
- Anna, can you give me a hand?
- Yeah, sure. What do you need?

303
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:51,451
A hand, behind you.

304
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,542
- Which one?
- Second row.

305
00:40:55,698 --> 00:40:58,167
- This one?
- The one on the right.

306
00:41:01,323 --> 00:41:02,916
Oh, sorry.

307
00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:08,618
Doctor Frankenstein, I presume.

308
00:41:09,282 --> 00:41:12,001
- Are you a fan of those old films?
- For sure.

309
00:41:12,323 --> 00:41:14,075
Okay, so what do you think
about my idea

310
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,323
of putting the mannequins among
the guests at the show?

311
00:41:18,157 --> 00:41:20,501
You could see them mingling,
like they're real people.

312
00:41:20,657 --> 00:41:24,491
Sometimes I think they have
more personality than most people.

313
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,743
I think we may have some
of the same friends.

314
00:41:35,698 --> 00:41:39,328
- So, what do you think?
- I think you're incredibly talented.

315
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:42,539
- Well, that makes two of us then.
- Not really.

316
00:41:42,698 --> 00:41:45,668
- I'm just a restorer.
- That one's my favorite.

317
00:41:46,698 --> 00:41:49,326
Okay, now you show me.

318
00:41:58,073 --> 00:41:59,871
It's amazing.

319
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:03,657
- It's gonna be perfect, Frank.
- I'm glad you like them.

320
00:42:03,823 --> 00:42:06,542
- I love them.
- Why did you want them to be faceless?

321
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:10,832
Oh, I have a little idea for the show.
You'll see.

322
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:14,747
Okay, I'm starving. Are you hungry?
You wanna grab some lunch with me?

323
00:42:16,823 --> 00:42:20,157
It's my third exhibition since
I've graduated from art center.

324
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:22,501
But it's my first with this gallery.

325
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:27,208
If it's successful they'll give me a show
in their other galleries in New York.

326
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,665
If something was missing...
Something tangible relating to the concept-

327
00:42:31,865 --> 00:42:35,699
The installation of your mannequins
with create the ambiance I was looking for.

328
00:42:35,865 --> 00:42:38,493
You know, when you came into my shop
you looked at them

329
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:40,500
like noone else ever did.

330
00:42:40,782 --> 00:42:42,204
You seem captivated.

331
00:42:42,365 --> 00:42:44,834
- You must have thought I was crazy.
- No.

332
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:48,411
You were so soulful with them.
So present.

333
00:42:49,323 --> 00:42:52,497
When my mother died last summer,
I wasn't so sure what to do with our shop.

334
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:56,867
Most stores couldn't care less about restoring antiques.
It's cheaper to buy them new.

335
00:42:57,073 --> 00:42:59,542
And if I closed the shop
I would've had to abandon them.

336
00:42:59,698 --> 00:43:02,907
It's like me and my old negatives.

337
00:43:03,115 --> 00:43:05,459
I have boxes full of them but I could
never see myself getting rid of them.

338
00:43:05,573 --> 00:43:07,746
Sometimes it's hard to move on.

339
00:43:10,657 --> 00:43:13,080
So what does your girlfriend
think of your work?

340
00:43:14,115 --> 00:43:18,245
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Really? Okay...

341
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,788
I thought you lived with someone.

342
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,492
Frank?

343
00:43:24,823 --> 00:43:28,407
- Are you okay? - It's nothing.
It's just a migraine. It'll pass.

344
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:32,207
- Should I call a doctor?
- No, no, no- I'll be fine.

345
00:43:32,365 --> 00:43:35,494
I just need my meds.
I'm used to it.

346
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:39,782
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Are you sure you don't need help here?

347
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,709
No, thanks.
I just need to be alone.

348
00:43:57,782 --> 00:43:59,625
Watch it, fuck face.

349
00:44:01,115 --> 00:44:02,492
Are you suffering from a migraine?

350
00:44:03,115 --> 00:44:06,415
This will have a similar effect
but you won't need a prescription for it.

351
00:44:06,532 --> 00:44:09,832
- And it comes in a nasal spray, so it'll work faster.
- Thank you.

352
00:44:46,407 --> 00:44:49,911
<i>We have found links connecting
the two victims in mid-town.</i>

353
00:44:50,115 --> 00:44:52,288
<i>But as our investigation
is still developing</i>

354
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:54,871
<i>I can not give you
any more details.</i>

355
00:44:55,073 --> 00:44:58,077
<i>All I can say is that all
of these women were caucasian,</i>

356
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,119
between the ages of 20-30.

357
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,413
They can talk all they want.

358
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:05,626
But they will never understand.

359
00:45:05,782 --> 00:45:08,126
As long as you keep a secret.

360
00:45:08,407 --> 00:45:11,616
But if you can't, it'll find you...

361
00:45:11,782 --> 00:45:13,750
and you'll be alone.

362
00:45:14,115 --> 00:45:15,708
You hear that?!

363
00:45:15,907 --> 00:45:17,375
The lot of you.

364
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:19,242
Alone.

365
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:26,661
- Now promise me you won't tell.
- Franky?!

366
00:45:26,865 --> 00:45:28,663
Hey, it's mommy.

367
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:31,201
Franky, honey, where are you?

368
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,163
Franky!

369
00:46:10,448 --> 00:46:12,246
Come here.

370
00:46:38,698 --> 00:46:41,042
Shh, momma loves you.

371
00:47:29,698 --> 00:47:31,496
Hey.

372
00:47:32,032 --> 00:47:34,785
The necklace is beautiful, Frank.
Thank you so much.

373
00:47:35,073 --> 00:47:37,542
- Did you make it?
- I did.

374
00:47:37,907 --> 00:47:39,454
That's original.

375
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:41,500
Where did you get the stone?

376
00:47:41,615 --> 00:47:43,492
It's something I found
in a thrift store.

377
00:47:43,657 --> 00:47:46,376
Is that real hair?
What is it?

378
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:49,664
- I believe it's horse hair.
- That's interesting.

379
00:47:50,532 --> 00:47:52,876
And what about you?
Are you feeling better?

380
00:47:53,073 --> 00:47:57,249
Oh, sure.
I've had migraines since I was a kid.

381
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:59,830
I forgot to take my medicine, so...

382
00:48:00,032 --> 00:48:03,411
It's really nothing.
Sorry if I've frightened you.

383
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:06,251
- It's okay.
- I just finished on-

384
00:48:10,573 --> 00:48:14,578
Um, you know- Sometimes I feel like
you come from another era.

385
00:48:14,782 --> 00:48:17,285
I love it.
It makes you very different.

386
00:48:18,032 --> 00:48:20,330
One second, Frank.
I'm sorry.

387
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,413
Thank you so much.

388
00:48:22,823 --> 00:48:24,245
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

389
00:48:24,407 --> 00:48:28,787
Sorry Frank, a friend of mine
was helping me and I had to say goodbye.

390
00:48:31,323 --> 00:48:34,998
I sometimes feel like
a slave-driver, you know?

391
00:48:35,907 --> 00:48:38,877
- I hate it.
- I can't say I know what you mean.

392
00:48:39,323 --> 00:48:41,246
I've always worked alone.

393
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:45,539
- You never feel lonely?
- Yeah.

394
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:48,413
That's why I was calling.

395
00:48:48,532 --> 00:48:50,751
I thought if you weren't
doing anything...

396
00:48:50,907 --> 00:48:52,159
I would love to.

397
00:48:52,407 --> 00:48:54,535
But I have so much to do tonight.

398
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:57,247
But what about tomorrow?
We could do something.

399
00:48:57,407 --> 00:49:00,251
Okay, yeah.
Tomorrow night works.

400
00:49:01,615 --> 00:49:04,084
- What time?
- Nine?

401
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,369
- Is that okay?
- Nine is perfect.

402
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:10,790
- I'll pick you up at the gallery?
- Yeah, super.

403
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:12,500
Cool.

404
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,412
Good night, Frank.

405
00:49:14,532 --> 00:49:16,205
Good night, Anna.

406
00:49:56,907 --> 00:49:59,877
Stop staring.
You're missing a movie.

407
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:14,539
Franky? Hey, it's mommy.
Franky?

408
00:50:14,782 --> 00:50:17,035
Franky, honey, where are you?

409
00:50:18,657 --> 00:50:20,455
Franky?

410
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,913
Are you alright?

411
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,663
Yeah, yeah.

412
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:48,659
I'm fine.

413
00:50:55,782 --> 00:50:57,409
So what'd you think?

414
00:50:57,532 --> 00:51:01,491
<i>You know, Caligari is -
to be the first horror movie.</i>

415
00:51:02,323 --> 00:51:04,951
I really thought she was gonna
get killed at the end.

416
00:51:05,115 --> 00:51:06,708
I'm glad that she didn't.

417
00:51:06,907 --> 00:51:10,537
Yeah, but they all end up living
in a mental hospital.

418
00:51:10,698 --> 00:51:13,952
I know but at least
it was a happy ending.

419
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:19,328
I may have just found
the last romantic.

420
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:21,788
Sorry.

421
00:51:24,573 --> 00:51:26,075
Hello?

422
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,537
Yeah.

423
00:51:28,407 --> 00:51:30,330
Where are you?

424
00:51:31,073 --> 00:51:33,201
Yeah, okay. Cool.

425
00:51:33,365 --> 00:51:35,208
Yeah, I would love to.

426
00:51:36,532 --> 00:51:39,615
Okay, I'll call you back
in five minutes. Ciao.

427
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:44,710
It's my boyfriend.
He's at a bar having a drink.

428
00:51:44,907 --> 00:51:47,080
You wanna have a drink with him?

429
00:51:48,073 --> 00:51:51,043
Frank?
Are you okay?

430
00:51:51,198 --> 00:51:53,951
- It's okay. I'm tired.
- Are you having another migraine?

431
00:51:54,115 --> 00:51:56,117
No, I'm fine.

432
00:51:56,282 --> 00:51:58,376
I just have some more work
I have to do at the shop.

433
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,413
Have fun, though.

434
00:52:01,073 --> 00:52:02,916
- Let's have one drink.
- No.

435
00:52:03,073 --> 00:52:04,416
- Just one.
- Really.

436
00:52:04,532 --> 00:52:06,034
Come on.

437
00:52:07,365 --> 00:52:09,914
- I had a very nice evening.
- Okay.

438
00:52:20,373 --> 00:52:22,059
Another time, I guess.

439
00:52:22,094 --> 00:52:23,746
Good night, Frank.

440
00:52:28,573 --> 00:52:30,200
Goodbye, Anna.

441
00:52:30,407 --> 00:52:33,081
<i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>

442
00:53:11,157 --> 00:53:13,706
Go wait for me in the car, Franky.

443
00:53:16,448 --> 00:53:18,917
Don't just stand there.

444
00:53:19,532 --> 00:53:21,284
Do as I tell you!

445
00:53:29,698 --> 00:53:32,121
Go wait for me in the car,
goddamm it. Franky!

446
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:45,411
- Hey guys.
- Hey. Good show.

447
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,205
- Do you think?
- Absolutely.

448
00:54:47,365 --> 00:54:49,038
- Really?
- It's great.

449
00:54:54,532 --> 00:54:56,660
Are you serious?

450
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,617
One second.

451
00:55:05,365 --> 00:55:08,289
- Hey Frank, I'm so happy to see you.
- Hello Anna.

452
00:55:08,407 --> 00:55:10,250
- You look stunning.
- Thank you.

453
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,580
- Really, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

454
00:55:12,823 --> 00:55:15,952
I just feel like I'm in
a carnival costume.

455
00:55:16,115 --> 00:55:19,369
This heels make me walk
like an ostrich.

456
00:55:21,907 --> 00:55:24,786
- I'm happy you made it, though.
- Me too.

457
00:55:25,073 --> 00:55:28,703
- Your photos are breathtaking.
- Thank you.

458
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,790
The way you made the mannequins
come to life at the projections.

459
00:55:33,115 --> 00:55:34,958
- Yeah.
- It's you, right?

460
00:55:35,115 --> 00:55:36,992
Yeah, it's me.

461
00:55:38,157 --> 00:55:40,501
My face on your mannequins.

462
00:55:47,198 --> 00:55:50,498
- Will you excuse me for a moment?
- Yeah, sure.

463
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:15,833
You lose something?

464
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:21,032
Anna loves to hang out
with her gay friends.

465
00:56:21,198 --> 00:56:25,624
I guess it's a way for a man never have to
worry about trying to fuck her.

466
00:56:30,573 --> 00:56:32,917
You're the mannequin guy, right?

467
00:56:33,073 --> 00:56:34,666
Lemme ask you something.

468
00:56:34,823 --> 00:56:37,747
Did you play with dolls
when you were a kid?

469
00:56:38,615 --> 00:56:40,993
- I'm not gay.
- What?

470
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,284
Good talk.

471
00:57:00,198 --> 00:57:01,791
<i>A famous person once said:</i>

472
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,243
<i>An artist is somebody
who produces things,</i>

473
00:57:04,407 --> 00:57:06,125
<i>that people don't need.</i>

474
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:09,409
You know...

475
00:57:10,157 --> 00:57:13,331
Your work might interest
another client of mine,

476
00:57:13,448 --> 00:57:19,034
whose general theme is destruction
of completely useless objects.

477
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:22,327
I'm sure he'd love to smash up
some of your mannequins

478
00:57:22,448 --> 00:57:24,450
at his next photoshoot.

479
00:57:24,615 --> 00:57:26,583
I'm in restoration.

480
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:29,246
So tell me, Fred-

481
00:57:29,407 --> 00:57:32,536
How does the restoration
process take place?

482
00:57:32,698 --> 00:57:36,373
Do you go dumpster diving,
department stores garbage bins

483
00:57:36,573 --> 00:57:38,496
in search of used parts?

484
00:57:38,657 --> 00:57:42,161
They're antiques.
You wouldn't find them in dumpsters.

485
00:57:42,323 --> 00:57:45,532
Honestly, I just find
the whole thing really creepy.

486
00:57:45,698 --> 00:57:48,201
You and Anna are the perfect fit.

487
00:57:48,365 --> 00:57:50,743
- Do you have a card?
- No.

488
00:57:51,115 --> 00:57:54,574
- Let me see if I have a pen.
- Dominique!

489
00:57:54,782 --> 00:57:57,251
Gorgeous!

490
00:58:03,573 --> 00:58:05,575
- Any buyers?
- A few offers.

491
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,914
But don't worry, the real money's
in New York. Okay?

492
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:14,199
- Okay, should I call you a cab?
- No, I don't live far. I think I'll walk.

493
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:18,165
- I can call you a cab.
- No, no, no. You go have fun, fun, fun.

494
00:58:18,323 --> 00:58:19,996
- Okay.
- And congratulations.

495
00:58:20,157 --> 00:58:22,159
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Bye, sweetheart.

496
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:24,535
- What's wrong with you?
- I guess I...

497
00:58:25,073 --> 00:58:27,792
Why do you always
have to do this?

498
00:59:24,657 --> 00:59:28,036
- Welcome back.
- It's nice to see you.

499
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:30,075
- Hey Jimmy. Have you been good?
- Excellent.

500
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:41,077
Changing your makeup
and hair style didn't fool me.

501
01:02:44,657 --> 01:02:47,376
You didn't think I'd recognize you?

502
01:02:47,657 --> 01:02:49,284
Why?

503
01:02:50,115 --> 01:02:52,334
Cause you think I'm stupid?

504
01:02:53,615 --> 01:02:56,289
Why do you act like
I don't exist?

505
01:03:00,573 --> 01:03:03,042
I never wanted to hurt you.

506
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:06,621
But you made me.

507
01:03:07,073 --> 01:03:08,825
Didn't you?

508
01:03:09,407 --> 01:03:10,784
Yes.

509
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:17,583
Yes, you did.

510
01:03:28,032 --> 01:03:30,626
Did you need to be
with all of them? Huh?

511
01:03:32,323 --> 01:03:33,745
Did you?

512
01:03:35,115 --> 01:03:36,913
Was it the money?

513
01:03:41,573 --> 01:03:43,416
Answer me!

514
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:48,626
You knew, they didn't love you.

515
01:03:52,657 --> 01:03:54,785
Not like I loved you.

516
01:03:56,823 --> 01:03:58,791
Not like me.

517
01:04:00,573 --> 01:04:03,076
I still love you.

518
01:04:03,365 --> 01:04:05,288
You know that?

519
01:04:20,782 --> 01:04:23,035
Please don't kill me.

520
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,949
- Please don't kill me.
- Oh. I'm not gonna kill you.

521
01:04:28,157 --> 01:04:30,410
I'm gonna keep you.

522
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:36,242
Mommy.

523
01:04:47,282 --> 01:04:50,832
You will not go out tonight.
Is that clear?

524
01:04:51,032 --> 01:04:53,751
You will stay home with me.

525
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:31,291
Hey, it's Anna.
Leave a message after the tone.

526
01:05:32,407 --> 01:05:34,580
Hi Anna. It's Frank.

527
01:05:34,823 --> 01:05:36,871
I'm sorry to bother you
at this hour.

528
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:40,164
I just wanted to know how long
you wanted to keep the mannequins.

529
01:05:40,323 --> 01:05:42,576
I have another client...

530
01:05:45,907 --> 01:05:48,751
Anna? What's wrong?
Are you okay?

531
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:51,538
Rita, my agent...

532
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,826
She was murdered last night
in her apartment.

533
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:56,709
Murdered?
Oh my god.

534
01:05:56,865 --> 01:06:00,244
Police just called me,
asking me so many questions.

535
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:04,040
Someone broke into her place.

536
01:06:05,115 --> 01:06:07,163
They must have been
waiting for her.

537
01:06:07,323 --> 01:06:09,951
Frank, it's awful.

538
01:06:10,073 --> 01:06:13,327
I can't believe it.
I swear it's a nightmare.

539
01:06:13,615 --> 01:06:17,540
You shouldn't be alone now.
Is your boyfriend with you?

540
01:06:18,323 --> 01:06:21,657
No. He's back in New York already.

541
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,825
Do you need company?

542
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:27,620
- No, it's okay.
- No, don't be silly.

543
01:06:28,032 --> 01:06:31,707
It's no bother.
That's what friends are for, right?

544
01:06:31,865 --> 01:06:36,041
- I don't wanna trouble you with this.
- Anna, I'll be there in 30 minutes.

545
01:06:54,032 --> 01:06:55,659
I know.

546
01:06:55,907 --> 01:06:59,036
Me too.
I miss her too.

547
01:07:00,365 --> 01:07:02,117
It's been a long time.

548
01:07:02,282 --> 01:07:05,365
I'm gonna get her back.
I promise.

549
01:07:22,698 --> 01:07:24,416
Come in.

550
01:07:26,657 --> 01:07:28,580
I didn't hear the intercom.

551
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,243
One of your neighbors
was walking out when I got here.

552
01:07:31,407 --> 01:07:35,412
I saw your name on the mailbox.
I hope you don't mind.

553
01:07:36,282 --> 01:07:38,580
I'm happy to see you.

554
01:07:44,115 --> 01:07:46,493
Oh, I didn't know you had company.

555
01:07:46,865 --> 01:07:48,867
I don't mean to intrude.

556
01:07:49,907 --> 01:07:52,160
Martin lives next door.

557
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:55,334
- Did you guys not meet at the show?
- No but I've heard a lot about you.

558
01:07:55,532 --> 01:07:59,241
- Martin Nunez.
- Frank.

559
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:06,834
He's a stylist.
He's helping me with the mannequins.

560
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:08,663
Yes but I'm really an actor.

561
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:11,326
I actually just booked
my first national, so...

562
01:08:11,532 --> 01:08:13,330
I don't know what that means.

563
01:08:13,948 --> 01:08:16,997
It's a national commercial.
For Sparkle toothpaste.

564
01:08:17,157 --> 01:08:19,125
See
- Ding!

565
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:23,209
Alright well...
I'm gonna leave you guys.

566
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:26,289
I actually have an audition
first thing in the morning.

567
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:28,663
So, if you'll excuse me...

568
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:34,494
- Oh honey. It's gonna be fine.
- Thank you.

569
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:37,788
Take good care of her, Frank.

570
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:39,995
See you.

571
01:08:43,823 --> 01:08:46,372
It must've been
a very long day for you.

572
01:08:50,532 --> 01:08:53,160
I know what it feels
like to lose someone.

573
01:08:53,323 --> 01:08:55,371
I'm here for you, Anna.

574
01:08:58,115 --> 01:09:00,664
Why would your boyfriend leave
for New York now?

575
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:06,243
Oh, we got into such
a fight after the show.

576
01:09:06,407 --> 01:09:08,501
It's always about him and...

577
01:09:08,948 --> 01:09:12,282
I don't even know what I was thinking
hooking up with that guy.

578
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:15,619
Really. He's such a music guy.

579
01:09:15,823 --> 01:09:17,951
Huh, they can be very pompous.

580
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:20,242
Yeah.

581
01:09:23,407 --> 01:09:25,626
I'm gonna make us coffee, okay?

582
01:09:28,657 --> 01:09:31,001
That was the first day we met.

583
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:41,118
I didn't take care of her.

584
01:09:44,907 --> 01:09:48,741
I was too busy talking to other people
and she left by herself.

585
01:09:49,782 --> 01:09:51,876
Don't blame yourself.

586
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,368
It's really not your fault.

587
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:06,413
Just try to let go.

588
01:10:06,615 --> 01:10:08,913
I know what you need.

589
01:10:14,032 --> 01:10:16,000
I'm so tense.

590
01:10:50,948 --> 01:10:55,499
You know, hair is the only part
of the body that lasts forever.

591
01:10:55,657 --> 01:10:57,409
I'm sorry, I can't.

592
01:10:57,990 --> 01:11:00,994
- I should've sent her home.
- Anna.

593
01:11:01,615 --> 01:11:03,288
She knew what she was doing.

594
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:05,584
She lived three blocks away.

595
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:08,334
What were the chances
of her getting attacked?

596
01:11:11,032 --> 01:11:14,081
Other girls were killed
and you had nothing to do with them.

597
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,959
Believe me, it's not your fault.

598
01:11:20,032 --> 01:11:24,242
I asked Rita needed a ride
and that's when she told me.

599
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:28,490
- Told you what?
- Where she lived.

600
01:11:28,782 --> 01:11:30,830
Isn't that what you were wondering?
How I knew?

601
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:34,290
I was just wondering what other girls
you were talking about.

602
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:37,994
The girls that were mutilated
and murdered.

603
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:41,826
It's all over the news.

604
01:11:42,823 --> 01:11:44,951
Rita had the same profile.

605
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,205
Don't you think?

606
01:11:47,365 --> 01:11:50,744
The police never mentioned anything
about other girls.

607
01:11:51,282 --> 01:11:54,991
It's probably an ongoing investigation.
That's why.

608
01:11:59,532 --> 01:12:02,661
Anna, you need to relax.

609
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:06,168
- Let me massage you again.
- It's okay.

610
01:12:06,407 --> 01:12:08,876
I- I would justÉ

611
01:12:09,073 --> 01:12:11,792
rather go to sleep, okay?

612
01:12:12,323 --> 01:12:14,417
And we talk tomorrow.

613
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:17,166
I'm very tired.

614
01:12:17,365 --> 01:12:19,038
Wait!

615
01:12:20,282 --> 01:12:24,287
I came all over across town
to be with you in your time of need.

616
01:12:25,532 --> 01:12:28,581
Well, I would rather be alone.

617
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:30,958
Please.

618
01:12:31,157 --> 01:12:33,410
Being alone isn't going
to help you.

619
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:36,118
Believe me. I know.

620
01:12:36,282 --> 01:12:40,082
I'm just gonna ask you
to leave now. Please.

621
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,208
What's the matter, Anna?

622
01:12:42,365 --> 01:12:44,993
I thought we've become friends,
you and I.

623
01:12:45,573 --> 01:12:47,951
You sound like a stranger.

624
01:12:51,615 --> 01:12:53,834
Why are you scared?

625
01:12:57,198 --> 01:12:59,200
Anna, come.

626
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:01,993
I think we need to
have a little talk.

627
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:05,913
Get off me.

628
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:11,288
Just calm down.

629
01:13:12,407 --> 01:13:15,661
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

630
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:19,039
It seems that we need to
iron a few things.

631
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:21,542
You know what I mean, don't you?

632
01:13:24,323 --> 01:13:26,951
Come, I think we need
to have a serious talk.

633
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:34,914
- Get off me!
- Let me explain it to you!

634
01:13:36,198 --> 01:13:37,996
Get off!

635
01:13:49,615 --> 01:13:51,538
Martin! Help me!

636
01:13:52,907 --> 01:13:54,534
Help!

637
01:14:05,115 --> 01:14:07,994
- What's the matter, Anna?
- Leave me alone.

638
01:14:08,115 --> 01:14:10,083
Go away.
Please, go away.

639
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,369
<i>Anna, it's me, Martin.
Open the door.</i>

640
01:14:13,573 --> 01:14:16,747
<i>Anna, what's happening in there?
Is everything alright?</i>

641
01:14:20,782 --> 01:14:23,080
<i>Anna, open the door.</i>

642
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:31,200
- Anna?
- Martin!

643
01:14:31,365 --> 01:14:34,118
- Anna, where are you?
- In the bathroom.

644
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

645
01:14:42,698 --> 01:14:44,996
Anna, open up.

646
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:46,741
I'm sorry.

647
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:50,494
I'm sorry.
Open the door.

648
01:14:51,823 --> 01:14:53,917
Open the door! Anna!

649
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:58,699
- Martin?
- No, it's not Martin.

650
01:14:59,115 --> 01:15:00,833
It's just you and me.

651
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:04,870
Now open up and let me explain!

652
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:07,789
- Martin, are you okay?
- Anna.

653
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
It's me.
What's happening?

654
01:15:22,865 --> 01:15:27,575
I came all across the town
to be with you in your time of need.

655
01:15:28,865 --> 01:15:30,913
I'm sorry. Please.

656
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,992
Let's talk first.

657
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:36,041
Leave me alone!

658
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,663
- Just go.
- No.

659
01:15:38,823 --> 01:15:42,327
- You need to understand.
- Go, please.

660
01:15:46,115 --> 01:15:47,788
Put the knife down.

661
01:15:48,782 --> 01:15:51,535
Put the knife, Anna.
Put the knife down.

662
01:15:53,573 --> 01:15:54,916
Put the knife down!

663
01:16:06,782 --> 01:16:08,750
Just calm down.

664
01:16:10,282 --> 01:16:12,125
Calm down.

665
01:16:12,282 --> 01:16:15,206
Just relax, just relax.

666
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:17,788
It's okay.

667
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,038
It's okay.

668
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:28,791
Okay.

669
01:16:48,032 --> 01:16:50,660
<i>Patrol 19, stand by.
Code 4-8.</i>

670
01:16:50,823 --> 01:16:53,372
<i>Possible suicide.
Marian Avenue 728.</i>

671
01:16:53,573 --> 01:16:55,951
<i>This is 19, we're on our way.</i>

672
01:17:09,323 --> 01:17:11,200
It's gonna be okay.

673
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

674
01:17:36,115 --> 01:17:37,742
Anna, please!

675
01:17:46,698 --> 01:17:48,200
Help!

676
01:17:50,948 --> 01:17:52,666
Help!

677
01:17:56,407 --> 01:17:58,080
Anna!

678
01:17:58,198 --> 01:18:00,041
Somebody?

679
01:18:05,323 --> 01:18:07,951
Wait!
Anna!

680
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:39,584
- Help me!
- Anna.

681
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,742
- Stop the car!
- What are you doing?

682
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,163
- Help!
- No.

683
01:18:45,698 --> 01:18:47,700
No! No, no, no!

684
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:18,083
Oh, no!

685
01:19:31,698 --> 01:19:34,076
Anna! Why did you do that?

686
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:42,084
Didn't you understand?

687
01:19:42,698 --> 01:19:45,167
I just wanted to be with you.

688
01:19:45,323 --> 01:19:48,372
I just wanted to be with you, Anna.

689
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,709
I never touched you.

690
01:19:52,073 --> 01:19:53,120
Not once.

691
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:58,869
Anna, I want to introduce you
to my mother.

692
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:31,407
We'll be together forever, Anna.

693
01:20:36,615 --> 01:20:38,458
I promise.

694
01:20:41,865 --> 01:20:45,165
No one will separate us again.

695
01:21:40,573 --> 01:21:42,450
Hey Frank.

696
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:47,119
- Do you like my nipples, Frank?
- Shut up!

697
01:21:47,948 --> 01:21:50,246
God, your hands are so warm.

698
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:52,834
- I'm gonna get you back, Frank.
- She's lying.

699
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:55,288
Please don't listen to her.
Don't listen to her.

700
01:21:55,448 --> 01:21:58,702
Did you play with dolls
as a child, Fred?

701
01:21:58,907 --> 01:22:00,875
You wanna take a bath?

702
01:22:01,073 --> 01:22:03,167
- No.
- You wanna take a bubble bath?

703
01:22:03,323 --> 01:22:04,575
No. I do not.

704
01:22:05,657 --> 01:22:08,001
Now leave. Leave!

705
01:22:09,573 --> 01:22:12,577
Oh, Frank. What happened?

706
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:16,620
I knew you were in the locker,
you naughty boy.

707
01:22:16,948 --> 01:22:19,246
Did you like what you saw, Frank?

708
01:22:19,407 --> 01:22:21,751
Don't listen to them.
They're lying.

709
01:22:21,907 --> 01:22:24,501
Frank, don't bring
any other girls home.

710
01:22:24,698 --> 01:22:26,621
I get jealous.

711
01:22:26,782 --> 01:22:29,376
I'm gonna tear you to pieces, Frank.

712
01:22:29,573 --> 01:22:32,577
I don't even know them.
They're lying.

713
01:22:35,782 --> 01:22:38,205
This is our home, Anna.

714
01:22:38,448 --> 01:22:40,166
Welcome.

715
01:22:43,407 --> 01:22:44,954
Welcome.

716
01:22:45,073 --> 01:22:48,407
This is where we live now, Anna.

717
01:22:52,323 --> 01:22:54,576
No, not you! Get out of here!

718
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,959
You hear me? Get out!

719
01:22:57,073 --> 01:23:00,498
Don't come near her. She is mine!
Do you hear me?

720
01:23:00,698 --> 01:23:02,166
Get away!

721
01:23:02,323 --> 01:23:03,950
She belongs to me!

722
01:23:04,073 --> 01:23:07,407
You will never understand
what we feel for one another.

723
01:23:07,698 --> 01:23:09,666
Where is she? Where is she?

724
01:23:09,823 --> 01:23:11,416
Answer me!

725
01:23:12,698 --> 01:23:14,416
Get your hands off of me!

726
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,496
Please. Let go.

727
01:23:21,448 --> 01:23:22,574
Ah, my leg!
