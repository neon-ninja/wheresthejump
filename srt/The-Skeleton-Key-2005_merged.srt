<i>"I lost no time, of course, in
telling my mother all that I knew...</i>

2
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,430
<i>"and we saw ourselves at once in
a difficult and dangerous position.</i>

3
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,730
<i>"Something must speedily be resolved
upon, and it occurred to us...</i>

4
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,390
"at last to go forth together...

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,400
"and seek help
in the neighboring hamlet.

"No sooner said than done.
Bare-headed as we were...

00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,090
"we ran out at once in the gathering
evening and the frosty fog.

00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,770

hundred yards away...

side of the next cove...</i>

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,140
"it was in an opposite direction...

00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,860

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,150

<i>"no soul would consent

20
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,520
Audrey? Sorry.

21
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,460
Mr. Talcott's gone.

22
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,630
Okay.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,340
Front desk, in case anyone shows.

24
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,000
I think you'll be waiting
a while, hon.

25
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,000
No. Didn't we call? He said he had family.

26
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,060
Yeah.

27
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,220
But they don't wanna have anything
to do with him.

28
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,240
You can dump it out back.

29
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,770
Okay, take a look.

30
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,060
I interview tomorrow.

31
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,240
What about your job?

32
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,690
I had enough of that place.

33
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,510
What happened?
Here's your beer.

34
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,820
- Thanks.
- Sure.

35
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,270
I lost a patient today. Mr. Talcott.

36
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,450
- I'm sorry.
- You should have seen it.

37
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,950
The second he died, it was like...

38
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,580
they couldn't wait to get him out of there.

39
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,860
It's just a business to them.

40
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,620
It is a business, but at least he had you.

41
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,000
No. It's supposed to be
a business about caring.

42
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,140
They couldn't care less.

43
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,070
Wait. This is Terrebonne Parish.
It's the freaking swamps.

44
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,490
I get the hours I need to start
nursing school, and I get paid.

45
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,560
And I get to help somebody, my way.

46
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,960
They got gators in the swamps,
and guys missing teeth.

47
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,350
Are we dancing here, or what?

48
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,820
Cary, look.

49
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,670
This work you're doing,
are you sure it's not changing you?

50
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,320
I'm 25 years old.
What's wrong with a little change?

51
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,740
Oh, my God.

52
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,250
Hello?

53
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,170
Hello?

54
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,630
Now that right there
is what love is all about.

55
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,510
Old-fashioned devotion,
like what you read about.

56
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,360
You must be Caroline.

57
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,050
I'm sorry, the door was open,
so I just walked in.

58
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,580
Oh, no. It's a big house. I didn't hear you.

59
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,130
It's okay.

60
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,530
So much for getting their affairs in order.

61
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,840
I'm sorry. I'm Luke Marshall. Estate lawyer.

62
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,690
We talked on the phone.

63
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,050
Oh, right.

64
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,430
The docs figure a month maybe.
He's pretty far gone.

65
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,550
I understand.

66
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,690
His wife's having kind of
a rough time with it.

67
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,550
Most people do.

68
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,560
Violet, you have a visitor.

69
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,360
May I present Miss Caroline Ellis?

70
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,060
She works down at the hospice
in New Orleans.

71
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,100
Caroline, this is Violet Devereaux.

72
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,470
You have a lovely home.

73
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,710
I'm sorry. It's just hard.
The idea of a stranger living here...

74
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,090
I understand, really.

75
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,230
She's Old South, you know.
She thinks women still curtsey.

76
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,340
So, he can't talk at all?

77
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,040
No. Stroke pretty much paralyzed him.

78
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,340
- Which side was affected?
- Both.

79
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,890
It happened about a month ago,
up in the attic.

80
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,070
That's where she found him.

81
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,190
Ben?

82
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,410
You have a visitor. Meet Miss Caroline Ellis.

83
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,230
Hello, Ben. I'm Caroline.

84
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,500
She's not from around here.
She not gonna understand my house.

85
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,720
She's from New Orleans.

86
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,800
She wasn't raised in New Orleans.
You hear how she talks?

87
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,230
Who knows where she comes from?
Hoboken, New Jersey.

88
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,200
What do you want a Southern accent?

89
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,380
The last one left, Violet.

90
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,170
All right.

91
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,140
But she's not gonna understand the house.

92
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,430
The last girl left, huh?

93
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,940
Wait. Let me talk to her,
we can straighten things out.

94
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,050
I can't help anybody
who doesn't want my help.

95
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,200
She does want help. She's just scared.

96
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,790
Of what? Politeness?

97
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,000
No. He's the love of her life and he's dying.

98
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,570
They've been together forever.

99
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,300
She's losing her soul mate here.

100
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,890
I don't know about you, but that'd
put some sandpaper up my ass.

101
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,750
Aren't you a romantic?

102
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,760
Look.

103
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,170
The last girl quit.

104
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,340
You're the fifth interview since.
She shoots down everyone.

105
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,380
It's not personal.

106
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,630
But you being here means he's really dying.

107
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,960
He's dying whether I'm here or not.

108
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,110
What'd she mean about the house?

109
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,630
What?

110
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,420
She said I wouldn't understand
the house. Why'd she said that?

111
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,590
All I know is her checks clear.

112
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,050
Look, forget it.

113
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,090
If it makes you feel any better, I'm
still looking for my dream job, too.

114
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,970
All right.

115
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,260
So if you talked to her, what would you say?

116
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,940
I'd say she could look all she wants...

117
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,350
but I doubt she'd find any better than you.

118
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,310
So she'd do well to treat you like it.

119
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,120
Okay, here are my rules. No knitting.

120
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,090
No joining a bridge club.

121
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,910
And no playing bingo.

122
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,220
Okay, good. Good rules.

123
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,750
I'm serious, they'll try and suck
you into their elderly ways.

124
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,050
It's less than an hour away.
I'll be back all the time.

125
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,580
Yeah, well, you better.

126
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,720
Whenever you want to talk to someone
who wasn't around for World War II.

127
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,030
Jeez, what is it with you and old people?

128
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,050
Come here.

129
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,410
He'd be proud of you. You know he would.

130
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,340
Hello?

131
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,320
I need to pay for some gas.

132
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,220
Hello?

133
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,090
Is somebody back there?

134
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,430
I'm sorry.

135
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,110
Excuse me. I just need to pay for some gas.

136
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,950
Jesus.

137
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

138
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,880
$17 for the gas.

139
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,040
Keep the change.

140
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

141
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,500
Mrs. Devereaux?

142
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,190
I'm unpacked.

143
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,060
Hi, Ben. Remember me? I'm Caroline.

144
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,810
I'll be taking care of you for a while.

145
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,060
There's not a lot of light in here
for you, is there?

146
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,560
So you're a fan of the blues, huh?
Well, so was...

147
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,740
You have to let go.

148
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,070
Ben, you're hurting me.

149
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,150
Ouch.

150
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,660
There you are.

151
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,560
Time for his remedies.

152
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,980
Scoot over, child.

153
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,270
9:00 in the morning and 7:00 at night.

154
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,610
He takes his pills in powder form.
I'll show you how.

155
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,650
Be sure he drinks it all down.

156
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,450
What's he taking?
Oh, Coumadin and such.

157
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,960
He gets the tremors sometimes.
Don't let that frighten you.

158
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,770
And a kiss to make it taste better.

159
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You're scrawnier than I'd hoped.
Prettier, though.
I bet you're all marked up, aren't you?

160
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,880
- Marked up?
- Written on.

161
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,540
I know you young people are always...

162
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,200
jabbing yourselves with ink and needles.

163
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,180
You're written on, aren't you?

164
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,240
Not where you can see.

165
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,280
Well.

166
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,710
He's to be bathed daily, his linens changed.

167
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,740
Don't bother with the housework.
I'm the only one that knows how.

168
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,490
How long have you two lived here?

169
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,280
Let's see.

170
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,990
We came over from Savannah in '62.

171
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,720
We bought this house
from a brother and a sister.

172
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,990
They'd inherited it a long time ago,
from their parents.

173
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,490
Lived here since they were children.

174
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,890
There they are. Martin and Grace.

175
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,150
Charming people.

176
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,330
But they fell on hard times, had to sell.

177
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,490
You keep their picture?

178
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,240
Yes. I like to pay my respects
to the memories of this house.

179
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,690
All right. Come along now.

180
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,170
This is the dining room.

181
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,870
We only use about half of the rooms.

182
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,110
The others are for Ben's antique business.

183
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,930
What he couldn't sell, we stored here.

184
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,900
Except for the attic.

185
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,050
That has crystal and china.

186
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,640
And I keep a very close account
on that, just so as you know.

187
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,170
There are more than 30 rooms in all.

188
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,790
In the old days, they made
a separate key for each room.

189
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,930
For the owner, they made a skeleton key.

190
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,800
This will open every door.

191
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,020
This one is yours.

192
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,620
I have mine.

193
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,780
Now, the pantry's right out here.

194
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,490
You know, we may have to ask you
to go into town now and then.

195
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,410
Was there a mirror here once?

196
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,370
I noticed in the bathrooms also
there are no mirrors.

197
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,440
Child, when you get as worn-out
and wrinkled as we are...

198
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,210
you don't need any reminding.

199
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,320
If you want a small one
for your own purposes...

200
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,440
that's fine with me.

201
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,220
- What'd you do with them?
- Put them away.

202
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,070
The boy tells me you don't smoke.

203
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,160
I do smoke. I smoke a lot
and I enjoy it very much.

204
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,670
I trust that won't be an issue.

205
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,730
It won't be.

206
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,220
Good. Then for the most part
just realize that...

207
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,370
I'll live here as if you're not in residence.

208
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,750
After all, we're not kin.
Are your parents still alive?

209
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,170
My mom left when I was little. My
dad raised me and he died last year.

210
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Oh, my. So you cared for him as well?

211
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,500
I would have.

212
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,010
I just thought I had more time.

213
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,060
Yeah.

214
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,130
You think too much about the time
you have left...

215
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,620
you don't spend it living.

216
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,790
Be good to my husband.
Be good to his house.

217
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,790
Remedies at 9:00.

218
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,890
One, two, three.

219
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,230
You don't see gardens like this
back in New Jersey, I expect.

220
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,730
Actually, it's the Garden State.

221
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,180
I doubt that very much.

222
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,280
Nothing more glorious than a garden.

223
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,810
Gone every winter, back every spring.

224
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,930
You religious at all?

225
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,100
I try to keep an open mind.

226
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,400
That's good. That's very good.

227
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,290
Where are my trilliums?

228
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,520
Oh, fiddlesticks. Do me a blessing, child.

229
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,720
Will you run up to the attic for me?

230
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,370
I have some seed packets in a box
right next to the stairs.

231
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,180
What took you?

232
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,610
I'm sorry.

233
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,100
I thought the key opens everything.

234
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,370
The key? What key?

235
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,330
The key you gave me for the house.

236
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,670
There's a door in the attic
it doesn't work for.

237
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,340
Oh, no, the attic, it's never opened that.

238
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- I got my Dixie-Johns.
- Why not?
- What's in there?
- I have no idea.
It's been shut ever since we moved in.

239
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,330
I have to get these in the ground,
because there's rain coming.

240
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,990
Mrs. Devereaux...

241
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,480
Ben was in the attic, wasn't he,
when he had his stroke?

242
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,560
What was he doing in there?

243
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,930
You'll have to ask him, child.

244
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,610
Be a dear and go see to him, won't you?

245
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
I wonder if he wouldn't like some iced tea.

246
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,550
His door was locked.

247
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,190
Ben!

248
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,670
Ben!

249
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,740
Ben!

250
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,750
Stop right there, Ben! Don't move!

251
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,300
Stop!

252
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,730
Ben!

253
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,910
Mrs. Devereaux!

254
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,980
Ben!

255
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,990
Ben, what are you doing? It's me!

256
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,370
Mother of mercy, what's he done?

257
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,740
He got out of the window. I thought
you said he was bedridden.

258
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:08,880
He's having spasms.

259
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,520
- Didn't you give him his remedies?
- Yes.

260
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,910
Did you make sure he drank them down?

261
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,920
I thought so.

262
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,170
- Ben, what'd they make you do?
- His door was locked.

263
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,080
Just go get the wheelchair.
We've gotta get him out of this.

264
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,220
What about a doctor?

265
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,150
In the morning,
just get that wheelchair now.

266
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,140
Caroline!

267
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,810
Caroline!

268
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,900
What in damnation took you so long?

269
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,400
I came as fast as I could.

270
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,680
We're just gonna have to double his
remedies. That's all I can think of.

271
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,600
Caroline, help me here. Help me get him.

272
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,000
Come on. That's it.

273
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,040
Where did you think you were going?

274
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,760
You're here two days and
he already tried to kill himself.

275
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,060
Must have some kind of
bedside manner, huh?

276
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,950
One of my many charms.

277
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,260
So, what exactly happened?
I came to update her will...

278
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,550
she's up with the doc, says he fell?

279
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,330
He did fall.

280
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,460
Like what, from his wheelchair?

281
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,010
You cannot be serious. From
up there? He fell from up there?

282
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,660
How? He can't even walk.

283
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,880
Please don't tell me you're quitting.
I have to start over again.

284
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,960
Will you shut the door?
I want to show you something.

285
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,700
You know what my mama used to say?

286
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,510
If a lady invites you into her room,
she probably isn't much of a lady.

287
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,670
Homespun Southern wisdom grows
on trees around here, doesn't it?

288
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,200
I found this in Ben's room...

289
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,710
last night.

290
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,400
Found what? His laundry?

291
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,160
No, it had a...

292
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,410
There was...
Had a what?

293
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,510
There was a... It had a...

294
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,100
Forget it.

295
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,820
I thought it...

296
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,960
I don't know what I thought.

297
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,520
I admire you.

298
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,860
You know, what you do.

299
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,900
Hell, I wouldn't be able
to take care of my own parents.

300
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,170
You'd regret it.

301
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,250
I quit college to help out
with some friends' bands.

302
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,430
Out all night, always on the road.

303
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,010
My father thought
I was throwing my life away.

304
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,530
So we didn't talk, didn't visit.

305
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,680
Stubborn and proud,
and that's how we left it.

306
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,920
You mean...

307
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,640
Yeah.

308
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,890
He was gone before
I even knew he was sick.

309
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,710
I guess he wanted to spare me from all this.

310
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,040
Is that so wrong?

311
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,400
No one should have to die alone.

312
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,970
So tell me what you were gonna tell me.

313
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,660
About Ben.

314
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,000
Do you ever feel like...

315
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,430
he's asking you for help?

316
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,670
- Asking me?
- With a look or...

317
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,890
a touch.

318
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,970
Mr. Marshall?

319
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,200
Where in damnation is that boy? Caroline...

320
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,560
have you seen Mr...

321
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,440
Well...

322
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,020
I see the children are getting acquainted.

323
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,290
Now, Violet...

324
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,690
you know you're the only woman in my life.

325
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,020
I know no such things,
and remove your perspirations.

326
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,230
The doctor has departed, so I'm ready...

327
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:27,460
to discuss estate matters,
if you have finished...

328
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,760
soliciting your new business.

329
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,060
All right.

330
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,980
Whenever you get the time.

331
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,120
Caroline?

332
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,350
I'm making some sweet tea.

333
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,100
Are you interested?

334
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,700
Caroline?

335
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
"Sacrifice."
Are you in the house?

336
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,080
Caroline?

337
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,050
You're forgetful, child.

338
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,410
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

339
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,530
<i>From the dry dust...</i>

340
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,450
<i>out of these chains...</i>

341
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,620
<i>from the devil's house.</i>

342
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,410
<i>It is time, Lord...</i>

343
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,940
<i>to take me...</i>

344
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,490
<i>from the dry dust,
break me from these chains.</i>

345
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,650
<i>Bring me from the devil's house.</i>

346
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,210
<i>Take me out of darkness.</i>

347
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,460
<i>Walk me out of blindness.</i>

348
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,940
<i>Lift me out of sadness.</i>

349
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,440
<i>Save me from my damned-ness.</i>

350
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,940
<i>Please, Lord.</i>

351
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,530
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

352
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,120
<i>Take me from the dry dust. Break me...</i>

353
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:56,020
<i>out of these chains.
Bring me from the devil's house.</i>

354
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,910
<i>Take me out of...</i>

355
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,860
Just a local band.

356
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,590
How about you buy me a drink?

357
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,420
Whatever it is, it's not your average attic.

358
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,560
She says it's been locked up
ever since they first moved in.

359
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,400
You found yourself a hoodoo room.

360
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,850
- A what?
- Hoodoo. You know what hoodoo is?

361
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,330
It's like voodoo, right?

362
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,170
Wrong. Voodoo's a religion.

363
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,640
Slaves brought it to Haiti from Africa.

364
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,940
You worship God, heaven and hell.

365
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,870
- How's hoodoo different?
- It's magic.

366
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:43,100
American folk magic.
God doesn't have much to do with it.

367
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,570
- Magic?
- Yeah.

368
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,870
It's part African, part European,
part Native American.

369
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,910
And New Orleans is its home.
It started here.

370
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,210
My Aunt Nola's into it.
She shops at a place in Algiers.

371
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,150
Look, you said the house
had a history, right?

372
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,900
- Hoodoo is pretty harmless.
- Harmless how?

373
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,140
It's psychological, like a lot of that stuff.

374
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,280
It can't hurt you if you don't believe.

375
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,640
So this place your aunt shops at...

376
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,390
Ever seen it?

377
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,620
It's either this street or the next one...

378
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,910
or the next one.

379
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,530
There.

380
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,610
There? That's a Laundromat.

381
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,680
Look, that's all I know.
That's where she goes.

382
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,350
So you coming in or what?

383
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,050
I'm not.

384
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,930
I thought you don't believe in this stuff.

385
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,090
I don't.

386
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,950
But I'm not just going
to mess around with it.

387
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,960
So, you wanna go in, go ahead.

388
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,850
You're scared.

389
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,560
- Jill the Thrill is scared.
- Kiss my ass.

390
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,180
You're never gonna live this down.
We come all the way out here...

391
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,750
I'm not scared.

392
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,910
Good night, Caroline.

393
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,720
Good night.

394
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,160
I told you about the mirrors.

395
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,180
I don't understand.

396
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,880
This is not your house.

397
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:43,280
I found them.
I needed a mirror for my bathroom...

398
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,610
I told you, and you heard me. No mirrors.

399
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,140
No mirrors!

400
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,540
I've seen the room.

401
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,280
- What room?
- The room you say you've never seen.

402
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,730
It's not locked anymore.

403
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,260
No, child, you don't know
what you've seen.

404
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,270
You're gonna tell me right now.

405
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,290
Or I'm leaving.

406
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,510
You're not from the South.

407
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,140
You won't understand.

408
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,540
That room up there,
you just don't go in and...

409
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,060
throw things out of a room like that.

410
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,430
You leave them just where you found them.

411
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,810
The house is theirs just as much as ours.

412
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,190
The house is whose?
Whose things are in that room?

413
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,960
All right.

414
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,190
About 90 years ago...

415
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,090
there was a banker here,
his name was Thorpe.

416
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,940
He made his fortune cheating the poor.

417
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,720
He was a mean man. He was a cruel man.

418
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It was him, and his family,
and couple of servants...
name of Mama Cecile and Papa Justify.

419
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,640
Sit down.

420
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,660
Now...

421
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:12,760
the way I heard it, old man Thorpe,
he didn't know...

422
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:16,440
that Papa Justify was
a "two-headed doctor."

423
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,960
He was a conjure man. So was Cecile.

424
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,450
- They believed in...
- Hoodoo.

425
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,800
Yeah.

426
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,190
That was their room.

427
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,710
<i>They were famous
all through the bayous.</i>

428
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,200
<i>They healed the sick
and they hurt the mean.</i>

429
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:48,360
"Hit a straight lick with a crooked
stick," as the coloreds say.

430
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:52,520
But old Thorpe, he just saw them as help.

431
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,430
And he worked them to the bone.

432
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,440
He abused them.

433
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,570
Until one night, as the story goes...

434
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,420
there was a party.

435
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,400
<i>It was the bank's anniversary,
all the big mucketymucks were here.</i>

436
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:14,560
<i>Politicians, sugar barons, riverboat tycoons.</i>

437
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,960
<i>There was a lot of drinking and dancing...</i>

438
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,190
<i>and a couple of trysts, I'm sure.</i>

439
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,760
<i>And then, finally,
when it was time to say farewell...</i>

440
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,340
<i>some of the guests wanted
to wish goodbye to the children.</i>

441
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:33,800
<i>But nobody could find them.
They hadn't seen them in hours.</i>

442
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,450
<i>So, being all full of brandy,
they made it a game.</i>

443
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,510
<i>"Let's Find the Children. "</i>

444
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,000
<i>Room after room after room.</i>

445
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,590
<i>Finally, someone heard music...</i>

446
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,220
Martin? Grace?

447
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,680
<i>... and voices and shouting...</i>

448
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,960
<i>up in the attic.</i>

449
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,550
<i>From the devil's house.</i>

450
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,630
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

451
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:58,580
<i>The servants were up there
with the children.</i>

452
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,940
<i>They were trying to teach them
how to conjure hoodoo.</i>

453
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,530
And take his head.

454
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:08,580
<i>Thorpe went about insane,
and so did the rest of the guests.</i>

455
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,430
<i>I mean, how long had this blasphemy
been going on?</i>

456
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:18,200
<i>The children said it was their
fault, that they'd wanted to learn.</i>

457
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,010
<i>But they weren't having any of that.</i>

458
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,610
<i>All that power and rage and insanity.</i>

459
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,590
<i>The party was over.</i>

460
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,470
It was a terrible thing.

461
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:14,710
Terrible.

462
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,820
Rumors got out, but no arrests, no trial.

463
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,240
Money had its way.

464
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,270
What happened to the family?

465
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,060
The bank went under.

466
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:36,280
Thorpe shot his wife to death,
and then turned the gun on himself.

467
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:42,500
People in the bayou say
it was Justify and Cecile's revenge.

468
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:45,500
The children stayed here till '62.

469
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,030
But they never, ever, told us
why that room was locked.

470
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:55,680
Or why there were no mirrors
in the whole house.

471
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,460
Now we know.

472
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,310
You know what?

473
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,330
You see them in the mirrors.

474
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,920
Who?

475
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:10,430
The servants.

476
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:14,080
I've gone and read
some hoodoo books, and they say...

477
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,700
- putting brick dust down'll keep harm away.
- Mrs. Devereaux.

478
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:20,070
So I made a big circle of it around
the whole house.

479
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,810
You can't expect me to believe
you see ghosts in your mirrors.

480
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,990
The ghosts are here now.

481
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,860
But whatever they did to him...

482
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:37,120
I am not going to let them do it to me.

483
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,640
Now you'll leave...

484
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,150
like all the rest of them.

485
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:50,220
That's some superstitious wife
you got there, Ben.

486
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,290
She thinks you have ghosts in the attic.

487
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,510
Spooky, huh?

488
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,290
Ouch.

489
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,380
Hold on. I'll be right back.

490
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,940
She says you see them in the mirrors.

491
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,310
Ghosts in the mirrors.

492
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,580
I'm sorry, Ben.

493
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:04,590
Ben, stop it.

494
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,620
Relax. I'm so...

495
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:11,840
I'm so sorry.

496
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,570
I'm so sorry.

497
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,380
You see them, too.

498
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,170
I'm going to town.

499
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:31,640
Shopping.

500
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,230
What for, Caroline?

501
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,870
Caroline, what for?

502
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,760
We'll just have to see.

503
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,360
He won't beat you again.

504
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,970
Mama Cynthia,
he beat me last night.

505
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,170
You use the potion
that I'm gonna fix for you...

506
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,830
and it won't happen again.
I will promise you that.

507
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:35,290
I'm scared.
Don't be afraid.

508
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,870
Are you sure that I can do it?

509
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,430
I know it will. It will work.

510
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,810
Just do as I say. Don't be afraid.

511
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,460
It will work, and it won't happen again, ever.

512
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,070
Don't worry about it. He won't hit you again.

513
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:50,370
Just use this potion I mixed up.
I have a lot of things in here.

514
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:52,550
And you use it as I told you.

515
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,300
- Okay, I'll trust you, Mama.
- You'll do fine.

516
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:05,670
That brick dust at the door,
how does it work?

517
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,040
You lay a line down.

518
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:11,520
Nobody that means you harm can cross it.

519
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:14,500
It's how you tell who your enemies are.

520
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,700
It's like hypnotism, right?

521
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:20,650
Suggestion?

522
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:24,970
And when this stuff works, it's
because someone believes it works?

523
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,130
And if you thought, you know...

524
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,630
magic made you sick...

525
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,670
you might believe in a magic cure, right?

526
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,200
Even though it's all in your head.

527
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,860
Somebody been working roots on you.

528
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,490
Say I knew someone
who believed he'd been...

529
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,010
- Crossed.
- Crossed.

530
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,310
Would he believe he could be uncrossed?

531
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,250
What's the nature of his condition?

532
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,910
He can't speak. Barely moves.
He had a stroke...

533
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,530
but he seems to think
someone else made him that way.

534
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,730
And you want to know
what happened to him?

535
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,950
Yes.

536
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,620
<i>You went in there.
You actually went in.</i>

537
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:15,790
Are you out of your mind?

538
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,580
Come on. Haven't you ever heard
of psychosomatic treatment?

539
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,400
Yeah. But this is not that.

540
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:25,230
How much of a patient's recovery
depends on his believing he can?

541
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,210
What recovery? This is hospice.

542
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:29,080
You're just supposed to help this guy die.

543
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,670
He believes in this stuff.

544
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,690
So what? Who is he to you?

545
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,870
Forget it.

546
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,660
No, you forget it. He's not your dad.

547
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,290
Not this one, the last, or the one before.

548
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,150
Why are the two of you so attached?

549
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,930
I'm sorry, Cary.

550
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,750
Just so you know,
if I'm not attached to him...

551
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,160
I'm abandoning him.

552
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:49,230
Attached is better.

553
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:52,750
I know. Cary, I'm sorry. Okay?

554
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,830
But would you look at yourself?

555
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:58,000
You want to be a nurse and you
just walked out of a witch doctor's.

556
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,500
It's not for me.

557
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:11,010
<i>Forecasters are calling
for up to a foot of rain...</i>

558
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:12,010
<i>in the coastal areas...</i>

559
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:15,390
<i>as this storm makes its way across
the delta, starting overnight.</i>

560
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,350
<i>Radar already shows
increasing precipitation...</i>

561
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:21,360
<i>across the coastal areas and moving
rather quickly to the north.</i>

562
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,160
<i>The main forecast concerns
centers around potential...</i>

563
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,330
Hi, Ben.

564
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,250
I'm gonna show you something.

565
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:41,750
It's going to be our secret. You and me.

566
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:48,510
Violet says you didn't have a stroke...

567
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,480
in the attic. She said some ghosts...

568
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,040
made you this way with a spell.

569
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,270
Is that what you think?

570
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,760
Because I know a spell, too, Ben.

571
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,990
One that makes you better.

572
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,850
All you have to do is believe it.

573
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:48,490
Backwards.

574
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,090
Cleanse this man.

575
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,710
Cleanse this room.

576
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,430
Cleanse this house.

577
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:07,720
His words have gotten lost,
lost and wandering in his mind.

578
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,240
Let the water run down...

579
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:13,320
and wash away this condition.

580
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:21,800
His tongue has gotten tied,
tied and tangled in his throat.

581
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,320
Let the water run down...

582
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,780
and wash away this affliction.

583
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,440
Send his voice to go free.

584
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,480
Let the water run down...

585
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:38,820
and wash away...

586
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,890
Caroline.

587
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,330
Caroline.

588
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,060
It's all in your head.

589
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,610
Help. Help.

590
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,060
Ben, talk to me. Keep talking.

591
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,600
Help me.

592
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:24,310
Help you? Help you how, Ben?

593
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,790
Get me out of here.

594
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,170
Caroline?

595
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:34,870
Get me out of here!

596
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,490
Shit!

597
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,500
- Caroline!
- Just a second.

598
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,490
Caroline, open this door!

599
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:43,830
What are you doing to him?

600
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:45,750
Ben, why? Get out of here, why?

601
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:48,280
- Caroline!
- One second!

602
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:49,810
Caroline, open this door!

603
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,790
I'll help you, I promise. Just talk to me.

604
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:55,100
What happened to you in that attic?
Tell me who you're afraid of.

605
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,510
What have you done?

606
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,380
What is this?

607
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,660
He was...

608
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,510
- He was struggling in his sleep...
- Get away from him.

609
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,490
- Get away from him.
- He was struggling.

610
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:11,900
It's all right.

611
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:13,620
I brought water.

612
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,000
You were talking to him?

613
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:18,270
I was just telling him a story
to settle him down.

614
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,730
- About what?
- Just a story.

615
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:24,890
No ghosts.

616
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,710
That'll be all tonight, Caroline. Thank you.

617
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,770
I'll come back to check on him...

618
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,640
No, that won't be necessary.
That's all for tonight. Good night.

619
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

620
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:07,100
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

621
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,220
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

622
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:30,780
Grace.

623
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,100
<i>Caroline?</i>

624
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,020
Caroline.

625
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,370
Mrs. Devereaux?

626
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,140
Her and her ghost shit.

627
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:08,360
<i>That attic is filled
with this stuff.</i>

628
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,570
Recipes. Spells. Books of them.
Records of them.

629
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,900
I understand your cause of concern...

630
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:17,650
but my family is superstitious, too.
We're called Baptists.

631
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:19,860
- This is different.
- It's charming.

632
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,010
Local color.

633
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,830
You said yourself
you were worried about him.

634
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:27,750
Well, now I'm worried about you.
You know?

635
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,260
Are you a nurse or a detective?

636
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,120
When did you first meet the Devereauxs?

637
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,130
Just before he had his stroke.

638
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,310
They were looking for a lawyer
to update their wills.

639
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:41,620
Did you ever think that
maybe she knew something...

640
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:43,000
was gonna happen to him?

641
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:47,250
How? Like tarot cards in the attic?
A séance in her sleep?

642
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,800
I want to know why the last girl quit.

643
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:53,760
Hallie. Some folks to see you.

644
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,500
<i>You a superstitious person?</i>

645
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:58,490
Not per se.

646
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,500
I told my mama
where I was working.

647
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:03,190
She said that house has been
nothing but blood and tears.

648
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,640
That the last owners were
some rich brother and sister.

649
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,620
Crazy people, supposedly.

650
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:12,220
They died of strokes
right after they sold the place.

651
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,710
Maybe they found something they shouldn't.

652
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:17,440
Maybe now Ben did, too.

653
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,620
It may be their mess in that room...

654
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:24,060
but ain't no ghosts
put a spell on that old man.

655
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:25,630
She did.

656
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:28,120
- Do you believe that?
- Don't you?

657
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:30,040
But I heard it can't hurt you.

658
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,840
I mean, it can't hurt you if you don't believe.

659
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:36,410
Then I suggest you leave that house
before you do.

660
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:43,010
For God's sake, this is insane.
The man had a stroke.

661
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,310
That isn't what he thinks.

662
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,680
And you're gonna take him away
from her? From his own wife?

663
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:50,070
- How can you believe...
- I don't believe. I don't.

664
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,930
The point is, he does.

665
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:53,890
Stop the car.

666
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,450
- Stop the car.
- Why?

667
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:59,110
I've been here before.
I'll show you. It's not just them.

668
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:09,090
See the line across the doorway?
It's brick dust.

669
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,130
Hoodoo. Keeps your enemies
from coming across.

670
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:12,280
See the bones hanging?

671
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,370
This stuff's got a hold on people out here.

672
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,320
Yeah, but it's not real.

673
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:20,290
It doesn't matter if it's not real.
It's real to them.

674
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,290
What's wrong?

675
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:28,420
This music. I know this music.

676
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,010
You sure this is a good idea?

677
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,760
Hello?

678
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,830
Mama raised a gentleman.

679
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:45,500
Hello?

680
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:47,780
Excuse me. Ma'am?

681
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:53,220
We heard the music, your record.
I was wondering...

682
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:55,660
There's no record for anyone here.

683
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:01,130
How about records by a man named Justify?

684
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,950
How do you know that name?

685
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:09,220
Who sent you?

686
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:14,120
Who else is in here?

687
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,930
- Someone else in here?
- It's just me, ma'am.

688
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:18,790
Stop now. Don't you go touching...

689
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:21,680
<i>Do you know a record called
the Conjure of Sacrifice?</i>

690
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,180
Because I have it, if you do.

691
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:30,660
You had that, you wouldn't say so.

692
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:32,200
You do know it.

693
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:37,930
The strongest conjuration of all.
They say Justify discovered it...

694
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,290
but he got killed
before he learned to work it.

695
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:46,220
Him and his poor wife both.
It's never been found.

696
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:48,140
What does it do?

697
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:50,100
It keeps you from dying.

698
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,230
Not forever, but for a while.

699
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,080
How?

700
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,740
You have to sacrifice somebody...

701
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:00,680
and take the years that they have left.

702
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:10,550
Hurry up! He's alone with her!

703
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,840
Hang on, Caroline! Wait! Shit!

704
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,070
Now you got me spooked.

705
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:18,700
If I get proof that she's out
to hurt him, will you stick by me...

706
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:21,070
- By "hurt him," you mean kill him.
- Will you or won't you?

707
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,770
Just listen to yourself.

708
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,880
Fine. Goodbye.

709
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,390
What are you gonna do here,
kidnap him?

710
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:28,470
You know something's wrong
between them. You know it.

711
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:30,840
Let me make some calls.
See about grounds for...

712
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,700
a restraining order, protective custody.

713
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,840
You're not gonna get a search
warrant till tomorrow anyhow.

714
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,500
Then that'll give me tonight.

715
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,430
I'm all he's got, Luke. Me.

716
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,960
Get the proof. Okay?

717
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:54,320
Mrs. Devereaux, I'm back.

718
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,060
No. Where's the record?

719
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,780
It was right here.

720
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,880
Mrs. Devereaux,
could you come here for a second?

721
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:16,000
Caroline, I was beginning to worry
about you...

722
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:17,500
you were gone such a long while.

723
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:19,140
It's really raining out there.

724
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,900
It's supposed to pour all night.

725
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:23,040
Keeps up like this,
that swamp's going to rise...

726
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,930
and ruin my flowerbeds.

727
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,670
Did you want to see me?

728
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,180
Yeah, I was wondering if
you could take a look at this?

729
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,590
There's a leak up here.

730
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:34,240
They're all over the house.
They're just rainwater.

731
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:38,530
Yes, but if you look up close...

732
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,860
Come on in. I could show it to you better.

733
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:56,240
Actually, I have supper on the stove.

734
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,430
I shouldn't leave it.

735
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:02,800
- It'll just take a second.
- I can see perfectly from here.

736
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:04,290
You want this for the sill?

737
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:06,660
All right.

738
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:12,240
Could you come into the room please,
just for a second?

739
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,150
So I can show you what I'm seeing.

740
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,900
You're a funny one, Caroline.

741
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,980
I'll make us some tea.

742
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,210
And, Caroline?

743
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:37,960
After you've given Mr. Devereaux
his remedies...

744
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:41,030
would you be so kind
as to join an old lady for supper?

745
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:42,630
- Well, I...
- Wonderful!

746
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,300
We should have done it days ago.

747
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:46,930
I've made something real nice.

748
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:00,370
We're leaving tonight.

749
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:09,900
Caroline!

750
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:12,870
Supper.

751
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,500
How's your gumbo?

752
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:38,420
I haven't started.

753
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:40,800
Would you like sugar for your tea?
I put it out for you.

754
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:43,130
No, I don't think I'll have any sugar tonight.

755
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:45,200
But I thought you liked it.

756
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:48,080
You always have sugar in your tea.

757
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,840
You think I'm senile, don't you?

758
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:53,840
Ghosts in the attic. Spells on my husband.

759
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,830
I just don't understand.

760
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,490
These ghosts, why would they put
a spell on him and not me?

761
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,180
I've been in that room, too.

762
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,810
Maybe because you don't believe in them.

763
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,100
Maybe all houses have spirits...

764
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:09,040
but we just don't see them
until we believe we can.

765
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:14,670
I'm really not that hungry.

766
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,970
Don't move. I'll fetch the candles.

767
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,970
Eat your gumbo. Oh, fiddlesticks.

768
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,250
Dinner by candlelight.

769
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,070
There.

770
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:04,790
So, was that the storm or the ghosts?

771
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:08,130
Well, say what you will about spirits.

772
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,200
I've always wondered
if there wasn't something...

773
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,800
we could learn from them.

774
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,580
Like a spell?

775
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:18,720
I have great respect for your husband.

776
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:21,660
And whatever he thinks
happened to him, he's fighting it.

777
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,620
What did happen to him, Violet?

778
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:25,510
You haven't touched your gumbo.

779
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:26,550
What have you done to him?

780
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,570
I made that special for you,
and you haven't even touched it.

781
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,660
What have you done?

782
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:33,280
He is my husband, and I am his wife...

783
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,740
and I will do to him whatever I wish to do!

784
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:37,850
He's not safe in this house.

785
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,750
What, what...

786
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,230
What is this?

787
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:42,890
You've done something.

788
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,510
He's not safe in this house. Not with you.

789
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,620
- This is my house.
- I'm taking him, Violet.

790
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:48,640
No!

791
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,610
Too late. Not again.

792
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,200
You little whore. He's mine.

793
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,540
Keep him in this house.

794
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,150
Keep him in this...

795
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:09,300
He's mine!

796
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,410
"Protection."

797
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:29,640
Where's the record?

798
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:39,720
Oh, God.

799
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:46,890
Got it.

800
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,330
You bitch.

801
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:05,230
Time to go.

802
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:21,330
Come on, Ben.

803
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,700
I'm going to get you out of here.
Just hold on.

804
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:49,910
Damn it!

805
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,310
Keep him in this house.

806
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,680
Hold on.

807
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,770
Caroline?

808
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:28,920
Oh, shit!

809
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:45,220
Caroline.

810
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,910
Come on, Ben!

811
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:55,040
We've got to hide you, Ben.

812
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,420
I'm gonna get help. I won't leave you.

813
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,300
Okay?

814
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:31,620
Caroline?

815
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,550
You think you can take him
out of this house?

816
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:43,400
You think you're stronger than me?

817
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:47,650
You've no idea how strong I am, Caroline.

818
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:54,400
Caroline!

819
01:14:58,510 --> 01:15:01,380
You're just making it harder on yourself!

820
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:04,610
Where are you?

821
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:13,220
You can't get away, Caroline.

822
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:16,040
You understand me?

823
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:19,020
You'll never get out of here, child.

824
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:21,640
Caroline?

825
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,770
Caroline!

826
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:28,170
Stop right there!

827
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,460
Thank you.

828
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:27,060
Luke!

829
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,650
Jesus Christ.

830
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:34,100
She tried to kill me.

831
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,950
She had a gun.

832
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,640
She knows I know. Ben's in trouble.

833
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:43,320
He's still at the house.
Call the police, Luke. I left him.

834
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:45,180
We got to get back out there.

835
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,590
The hell we do.

836
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,250
I left him there.

837
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:51,990
You didn't leave anyone. Okay? Slow down.

838
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:55,130
Tell me what happened.
She tried to kill you?

839
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:58,140
Sorry.

840
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,590
Mrs. Devereaux.

841
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:03,450
To what do I owe the...

842
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:07,260
Heard from Caroline? Why would she have...

843
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,140
What's going on?

844
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:14,450
Okay. What happened tonight?

845
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:17,590
Hang on a second.

846
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:19,710
We need to record this.

847
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,460
Hurting him? Hurting him how?

848
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,230
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

849
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:35,230
I am listening to you.

850
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:43,630
Good night, child.

851
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:08,580
A hell of a thing, isn't it?

852
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,280
See, everywhere you look...

853
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:14,470
it's a whole new world all around you.

854
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,940
It's like being born.

855
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:20,270
Or dying. Of course, I wouldn't know.

856
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,150
Hush, darling. I know it's hard.

857
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:48,850
We're home!

858
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,530
He's missing. She's hidden him somewhere.

859
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,290
Where is he, Caroline?

860
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,450
It's not him, it's me.

861
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,900
You want to sacrifice me.

862
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:03,700
Where is he, Caroline?

863
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,650
Why are you helping her?

864
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,850
- Is everything ready?
- No.

865
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:12,150
I can't start anything till I know where he is.

866
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:14,290
What's our tale if he gets away?

867
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:16,630
Caroline...

868
01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:19,860
you will tell me exactly
where my husband is.

869
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:24,110
There's nothing anybody can do
for him, so there's no need to try.

870
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,360
Where is he?

871
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,790
Where is he, Caroline?

872
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:36,180
He's in the garden shed.

873
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:43,280
Don't scratch her up any more
than she already is.

874
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,400
She's teaching you.

875
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,920
You help her kill me,
and she'll teach you how.

876
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,940
Ben knew, too, didn't he?

877
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,450
That's enough, Caroline.

878
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,860
You want to shoot me, shoot me.

879
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,960
Stop right there, Caroline!

880
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:10,290
I want my father's picture.

881
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:14,360
I want it with me.

882
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:16,320
Please.

883
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:32,600
Jesus. All right.

884
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:35,740
You want your picture,
I'll get your goddamn picture.

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

886
01:21:57,470 --> 01:21:58,460
Fuck!

887
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,230
Violet, she's going outside!

888
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,320
Violet!

889
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:29,610
She's here!

890
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,620
Quick! Go get her! Help me!

891
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:36,550
Come on.

892
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,310
She's fixed the door!

893
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:02,990
Violet, I can't get up the stairs!

894
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:19,150
You try to use my tricks on me?

895
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,190
On me, huh?

896
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:54,030
No!

897
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:26,350
<i>911 emergency.</i>

898
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,560
My name is Caroline Ellis.

899
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:30,740
I'm at 1750...

900
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:33,750
Bayou Chapelet in Terrebonne Parish.

901
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:35,930
I need police and paramedics.

902
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,520
There are people hurt here. We're trapped.

903
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:40,190
Please hurry.

904
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,150
<i>- What time is it?
- Jill.</i>

905
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:50,110
<i>- Jill.
- Cary?</i>

906
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,540
Jill, I'm in trouble.

907
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:52,790
Caroline?

908
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,010
It's real.

909
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:57,010
<i>- It's all real.
- You're where? What?</i>

910
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:59,230
I'm in the Devereaux house.

911
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:02,160
<i>What's real? What...</i>

912
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:04,470
Jill?

913
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:13,620
Caroline!

914
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You can't get away, Caroline.

915
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:27,330
Oh, God, no.

916
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:29,470
Caroline.

917
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:40,670
"Chalk, sulfur, blood, hair."

918
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:52,960
Sulfur.

919
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:56,670
Candle.

920
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,080
Chalk.

921
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,190
Hurry!

922
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:20,160
Circle.

923
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,890
Eyes.

924
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:26,270
Four eyes. North, south.

925
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:29,420
Hurry! Oh, God, please.

926
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,370
What's next?

927
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,490
Hair.

928
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
My child...
I believe you broke my legs.

929
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:54,920
You can't touch me.

930
01:26:55,400 --> 01:27:00,140
You can't get near me. See this?
This is your spell of protection.

931
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:02,570
Is that what that is now?

932
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,540
And who exactly gave you that spell?

933
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,700
All that circle protects is you...

934
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:12,070
from leaving it.

935
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:20,000
You stay back!

936
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:22,020
I'll kill you! You stay away!

937
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:24,840
We've been waiting for you, Caroline.

938
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:27,140
Waiting for you to believe.

939
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:30,250
It doesn't work if you don't believe.

940
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:34,220
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

941
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:37,190
<i>From the dry dust out of these chains.</i>

942
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:38,510
I don't believe.

943
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:41,860
I don't.

944
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:46,730
I think you do.

945
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:51,240
The weakness is the flesh.
The flesh, the flesh.

946
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:53,560
I don't believe.

947
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:56,790
I don't...

948
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:01,340
I don't believe in it.

949
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,950
The flesh. The coil.

950
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,130
I don't believe.

951
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:15,440
The frail. The weak.

952
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:17,430
I don't believe.

953
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:20,530
I don't...

954
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:22,540
No.

955
01:28:25,330 --> 01:28:26,650
Oh, my God.

956
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:33,460
I don't believe!

957
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:37,070
I don't believe!

958
01:28:37,690 --> 01:28:39,220
I don't believe!

959
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:41,200
I don't believe!

960
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:06,180
Thank you, child.

961
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,060
Cecile?

962
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:19,740
You all right?

963
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,180
I'm fine now, Justify.

964
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:28,100
A fair bit harder than the lawyer,
wasn't she?

965
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:30,000
It's harder every time.

966
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:33,190
They just don't believe like they used to.

967
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:34,690
Got to get them riled up.

968
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,730
I told you I wanted a black one this time.

969
01:30:43,150 --> 01:30:45,290
You know the black ones never stay.

970
01:30:46,610 --> 01:30:48,580
Beggars can't be choosers.

971
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:51,720
I think it fits you beautifully.

972
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:55,430
It's better than Violet, or Grace, even.

973
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:00,610
We'll get used to it. We always do.

974
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:18,210
The thing folks don't understand
about sacrifice...

975
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,610
Get me out of here.

976
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:25,030
...sometimes it's more of a trade.

977
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:26,800
Get me out of here.

978
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:30,990
No!

979
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,920
There, there, Caroline.

980
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:49,580
We thought it was just a fall, but
now she can't move or even speak.

981
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,410
Like a stroke or something.

982
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,560
Cary?

983
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:55,000
Dearie me.

984
01:31:58,610 --> 01:31:59,890
You called me.

985
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:01,400
I called you?

986
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:06,420
For help. Don't you remember?

987
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:10,290
Cary's not herself right now.
I'm Luke Marshall.

988
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:14,070
- Devereauxs' lawyer.
- Hi. Jill Dupay, her roommate.

989
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:16,560
Jill, yes, I did call you.

990
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:19,350
Fiddlesticks.
I don't know what possessed me.

991
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,600
It's all right. I'm here.

992
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:26,100
They need real care now.

993
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,410
They can't stay here.

994
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:30,200
This is all my fault.

995
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:31,960
No, Cary. No, it's not.

996
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,010
It's not.

997
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:47,450
Someone should ride
to the hospital with them. Maybe...

998
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:51,670
Jill, would you mind? And we'll meet you.

999
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,230
Of course. Whatever you need.

1000
01:33:02,430 --> 01:33:05,910
She meant so much to them, her being here.

1001
01:33:07,170 --> 01:33:09,080
I know it wasn't for long, but...

1002
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:12,220
they really loved her.

1003
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:14,520
Why do you say that?

1004
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,540
It's in their wills.

1005
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:24,130
They left her the house.
