1
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:18,875
Angela.

2
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,416
Yeah.

3
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,166
You going to help me load this or not?

4
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,083
Jackson, you better help load up.

5
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,083
Yes, I will, I will.

6
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,208
Go, go help them.

7
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,458
Be careful with that, Jackson.

8
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,083
- Ange, can you grab my purse?
- Be careful.

9
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,958
El, relax. Uni's got insurance.

10
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,500
But we still gotta get it
back on Monday in one piece.

11
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,041
Thanks.

12
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,666
Elliot!

13
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,583
Let's go. Time is money.

14
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,708
Jackson. We spoke on the phone.

15
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,041
Pleased to meet you.

16
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,000
So, yeah. This is...

17
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:17,958
Angela.

18
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,333
- My sister.
- Of course.

19
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,250
The one with the gift.

20
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,875
Yeah.

21
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,166
I read what you did
for that family in The Herald.

22
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,333
Yeah. There she goes, she can feel it.

23
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,041
- There's something.
- Yeah.

24
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,083
Hi, there.

25
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,375
It's okay, darling. You can say hello.

26
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,416
Hello.

27
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,625
We're gonna talk to your mom.

28
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,250
And we're gonna get her back to heaven.

29
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,666
We're gonna make everything all right.

30
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,000
El...

31
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,125
Elliot, it's not working.

32
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,958
Hang on a bit.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,166
Should be up.

34
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,416
Try now.

35
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,041
Yep, got it, El.

36
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,666
Did she have any nicknames? Pet names?

37
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,000
Maddy.

38
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,166
Everyone called her Maddy.

39
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,708
What's that? What's he doing?

40
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:38,333
It's an EMF meter
measuring electromagnetic fields.

41
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,208
Are you getting anything?

42
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:45,041
Definitely. Especially
in the basement. Really hot down there.

43
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,208
She used to spend
all of her time down there.

44
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,625
We're running a tailoring business
out of the house for years.

45
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,458
I'm sorry.
It's just been really hard for us.

46
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,291
Susie especially.

47
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,833
How long has it been for you?

48
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,208
Since your mom?

49
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,000
Five years,

50
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,000
this December.

51
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,541
Must be very difficult.

52
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,375
Yeah.

53
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,125
Okay, Angela, I'm gonna send you in.

54
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,291
Take your time.
Remember, you need to be thorough.

55
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,500
Got it.

56
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,958
Any trouble, we're right here.

57
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,083
Stop it.

58
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,041
Sell it.

59
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,916
We filming something today?

60
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,166
You okay?

61
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,041
Are you on something?

62
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,875
You are.

63
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,500
Let's get this over with.

64
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,541
Maddy?

65
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,083
Maddy?

66
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,500
My name is Angela Sayers.

67
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,208
Your husband Frank, he called me here.

68
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,583
I've come to see if you'd consider
leaving this house.

69
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,791
Your husband, your daughter...

70
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,583
they miss you so much,
but they need to move on.

71
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,333
Frank? Susie?

72
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,333
Did you hear that?

73
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,083
You heard that, right?

74
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,208
Is she... is she there?

75
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,333
Can she see her?

76
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,083
It's an auditory gift.

77
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,291
Frank, now please.

78
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,583
Goodbye.

79
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,333
She's gone.

80
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,791
- She's at peace.
- There it is.

81
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,958
- Maddy has left the house.
- My God, Jackson.

82
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,958
You could just pay Beth.

83
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,416
And, I have to check on my sister now.
This...

84
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,375
- This really takes a toll on her powers.
- Yeah.

85
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:06,875
Yeah, of course.

86
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

87
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,250
Ange...

88
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:12,750
you okay?

89
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:14,875
What happened?

90
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,208
You can stop.

91
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,208
To the Scots...

92
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,500
and their haunted land.

93
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,500
Show Elliot the ad
you've been working on. The flyer.

94
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,750
Yeah. Yeah.

95
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:12,041
"From tragedy to triumph.
Angela inherited her mother's gift."

96
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,333
I don't know. What would you want me
to say about it, Jackson?

97
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,083
We are gonna take this place over.

98
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,666
I thought we were losing
the mom-daughter thing.

99
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,208
Why, because Ange wanted to?

100
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,833
Look, yeah,
but I'm in this for the filmmaking.

101
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,958
What do you wanna do?
Wanna go off to Hollywood?

102
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,583
- No. I think this is bullshit.
- El! Go to Hollywood right now.

103
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,500
We are gonna stay here
and make shitloads of money.

104
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,291
- You're such an asshole.
- Ange, wait up.

105
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,208
Want me to put it on?

106
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,041
You know, earlier in the basement,

107
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,416
you seemed pretty upset.

108
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,291
Yeah, I could kill Jackson.

109
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,708
Could have used a warning
when she attacked.

110
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,958
- When who attacked?
- Come on!

111
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,083
Wh...

112
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:08,000
What, did you guys sneak in before?
Rig some pulley system to make her move?

113
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:08,916
No.

114
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,583
I've got no idea
what you're talking about.

115
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,250
Forget it.

116
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,208
You okay?

117
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Dear Mr. Sayers, ...discuss the discharge
of your daughter... in our hospital.

118
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,166
I should be glad to assist
you and your daughter...

119
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,666
Really?

120
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,083
Hello.

121
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,125
Is this the medium service?

122
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,208
It is, yeah.

123
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,958
How soon could you come out?

124
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,166
Where are you located?

125
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,083
Off the A77. The Green Estate.

126
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,416
I cannot get them to stop screaming.

127
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,125
Get who to stop screaming?

128
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,750
The girls.

129
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,166
I can hear them every night.

130
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,916
Okay, we...
We're not available at the moment.

131
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,333
We're quite busy.
So I don't think we can. No, sorry.

132
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,166
I'm sorry.

133
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,333
Follow this simple technique.

134
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,750
Find a quiet place with a mirror

135
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,833
where you will not be interrupted.
Look at yourself,

136
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,291
and focus.

137
00:13:56,541 --> 00:14:00,000
It's a gift. She has a gift.

138
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,625
She has a gift. She has a gift.

139
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,791
Angela, do you see a future in psychology?

140
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,166
You've missed many assignments,
days of class.

141
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,541
Yeah, I haven't been
feeling very well recently.

142
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,541
This is just a little extra money
on the side.

143
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,708
If you're not serious about this program,

144
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,916
another student
will gladly take your place.

145
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,166
No, I am, I've been dealing
with some family stuff.

146
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,416
Have you considered
talking to somebody about it?

147
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,583
Angela.

148
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:46,041
It's nothing to be ashamed of,
we have excellent school counselors here,

149
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,708
- trained to help.
- I don't want to talk to anyone.

150
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,583
Well...

151
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,708
I can't pass you on good intentions.

152
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,375
Okay, is there something I can do,
any extra work I can do?

153
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,166
How about this?

154
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,416
For starters, show up.

155
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,250
You have potential. Embrace it.

156
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:09,291
Don't be afraid
to really throw yourself into it.

157
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,791
You might surprise yourself.

158
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,333
- Angela.
- Angela.

159
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Sorry, you have...

160
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,500
Who are you?

161
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,625
Grandpa, you can't joke about that.

162
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,041
Jokes are all I've got left, Angie-pie.

163
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,125
Hey Barney.

164
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,541
How's Grandpa holding up?

165
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,208
Is he remembering to walk you?

166
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,416
Hey, I heard that.

167
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,041
And I heard that.

168
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,750
Is that a no?

169
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,625
Here.

170
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,375
Your gran loved this song.

171
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:30,916
So...

172
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,791
How's university?

173
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,208
It's good.

174
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,500
It's okay.

175
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,333
So why didn't you bring
any of those wee cakes

176
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,000
you bought the last time?

177
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,875
She was always your favorite subject?

178
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,666
Would you tell my grandson
he still owes me £500, from the last,

179
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,208
get-rich-quick scheme he had?

180
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,875
Confidence is an armor against the world.

181
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,541
A confident man is a successful man.

182
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,375
Tame your mind and master your thoughts.

183
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:21,041
If you can control your mind,
you can influence others.

184
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,416
What was she like?

185
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,041
Before it all went...

186
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,000
Your mother...

187
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,250
pushed everyone away.

188
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,791
Drove your Gran mad, she was never here.

189
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,416
Went to America, never told anyone.
Started that...

190
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,833
god-forsaken business.

191
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,375
Met your father.

192
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,458
I don't know what happened after that.

193
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,916
So she disappointed you?

194
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,666
It was a nonsense.

195
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:54,000
Locking herself away for... years.

196
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,125
Talking about...

197
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,916
voices in her head.

198
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:06,333
Nose bleeds, talking about people
that weren't there.

199
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,625
And then, she has to go and end it.

200
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,250
Your mother was afraid.

201
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,500
If she had...

202
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,166
more strength...

203
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,208
she'd still be here.

204
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,500
Yeah, this is Sayer's Medium Service.

205
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,916
No, we're available.
Who told you that?

206
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,666
- What happened to your face?
- Don't worry about it.

207
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,416
What did you say to that old lady?

208
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,083
Old lady?

209
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,166
Jackson, seriously,
what are you messed up in?

210
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,125
She called back.
Said you turned her down.

211
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,625
I just...

212
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,291
can't, it's too much.

213
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,208
Whatever happened to coming here
being a fresh start?

214
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,000
We're doing the same shit
we did back home.

215
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,000
- You agreed to it.
- Because you made me.

216
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,583
And you said
it was going to be for a little while.

217
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,500
- When's it going to end?
- How do you think we've gotten by?

218
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,041
Fresh starts are not cheap.

219
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,666
We don't have the equipment
to cover a place that big, anyway.

220
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,458
I've been calling El.
He'll have to gear up to sell it. Hey!

221
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,958
We'll cheat it. She sounds ancient.
She won't know the difference.

222
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,333
Scary shit has happened
in that house, Jackson.

223
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,708
- Where?
- Little girls were murdered.

224
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,333
- Little girls?
- Come on!

225
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,916
It's going to be like every other gig.

226
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,125
"My dead kid.

227
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,333
I miss her."

228
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,708
"My dead wife.
She won't leave us alone."

229
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,000
Boo-fuckin'-hoo. All we gotta do

230
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,583
is put on a damn good show
and she sleeps better at night.

231
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,000
- That has nothing to with this.
- What's your issue?

232
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,333
She wants to pay us double our rate.
So she can move on.

233
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,208
It's a no-brainer.

234
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,791
I don't know.
I'm not a hustler like you and mom.

235
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,750
You really wanna go there?

236
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,458
- Jackson...
- Ever since mom killed herself,

237
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,208
all you've done is judge me,

238
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,583
about how I dealt with it
or didn't deal with it.

239
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:04,916
Mom scratched her eyes out
because she couldn't handle reality.

240
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,875
This is our reality.

241
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,583
She left us shit.

242
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,333
All we got is grandpa who barely knows
what day of the week it is.

243
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,875
He knows how much you owe him.

244
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,625
I've been trying to make this work.

245
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,791
But you don't make it easy.

246
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:24,625
You think mom was some victim.
She wasn't. She left us, remember?

247
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,000
You better take control
of whatever's spiraling through

248
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,291
your little head right now.

249
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:33,083
Otherwise, you're gonna end up
a nutbag just like mom.

250
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,791
And we all know how that turned out.

251
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,083
Fuck you.

252
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,000
Ange, please. I need the money.

253
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,875
- We can find another way.
- I can't do it without you.

254
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,958
They're going to kill me.

255
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,125
- What are you doing?
- Going.

256
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,291
Going where?

257
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,416
Back to London. With or without you.

258
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:17,791
Hey.

259
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,541
Jackson, they know where we live.

260
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,583
I swear.

261
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,958
Please, I pay off Craig
and then we're gone.

262
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,291
I promise.

263
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,416
Angela...

264
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:23,791
Beth?

265
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,916
I need you...

266
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:50,333
Hello?

267
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,208
Angela...

268
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,916
I can't find your brother.

269
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,041
Mom.

270
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:18,250
Angela.

271
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,208
I'm in.

272
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,250
Thank you, baby sis.

273
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:02,791
This is it.

274
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,125
This is it.

275
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:42,208
What you looking at?

276
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,208
That's where they found the girls' bodies.

277
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,250
- Where? In that building?
- Elliot, don't point.

278
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:54,333
Her son left them all
sitting in a circle.

279
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,000
Propped up. Facing each other.

280
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,375
All right. Game faces.
Let's go say hi.

281
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:29,291
- You must be Jackson.
I am indeed. Mrs. Green, pleasure to...

282
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:33,458
- Who did that to you?
- Your gardener, he hit me with his locks.

283
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,041
Handsome and funny.

284
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,708
Victor's quite harmless.

285
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:42,250
Hello.

286
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:44,958
Angela.

287
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,208
This is Elliot, out technician.

288
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:53,375
And also Beth. Also very technical.

289
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,333
Come in.

290
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:22,416
You look very pretty.

291
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,833
Thank you.

292
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Go on. On the table.

293
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:29,708
Okay.

294
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,125
They're a wee bit under-baked.

295
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:35,041
That's how my girls liked them.

296
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:37,791
Girls first.

297
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:40,375
Thank you.

298
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,041
It's a great place, Mrs. Green.

299
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:49,541
It was much easier to manage
when my husband was alive.

300
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:54,250
Then we had a... housekeeper, cook.

301
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,166
- And a landscaper.
- Is it okay, actually,

302
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:02,833
sorry, if we get this part out of the way,
what we agreed to.

303
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,833
Well, yes. But...

304
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,375
After the job's done, correct?

305
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:16,708
I'm sorry. lt's kind of awkward,
but, it'd be great to just, sort it.

306
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,791
That's what you say on your flyer.

307
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:22,125
You've got the flyer, right.

308
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:27,166
- Where'd you get that?
- You said you heard screaming?

309
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,041
Yes.

310
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,125
Laughter...

311
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:37,000
to start with. And giggles.

312
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:38,708
But then...

313
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,666
angry, taunting.

314
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,250
It's been 15 years

315
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,083
since we discovered what Herman...

316
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:58,375
Is it true that he murdered all the girls?

317
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:03,500
That was a tragedy, Mrs. Green.

318
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:07,125
And that's what we're here to help with.

319
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:09,666
I wish I'd seen the signs earlier.

320
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:14,125
He was a curious child, my son.

321
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,666
I failed them.

322
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,791
I loved those girls.

323
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,208
It wasn't your fault.

324
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,208
I just want a quiet house.

325
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,333
Um...

326
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:46,208
Okay, we'll need that one.
Yeah, just put into that...

327
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:49,666
So, um... I was wondering
if you might have some photos.

328
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,541
- Photos?
- Of the girls, something I could use

329
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,416
- to connect with them.
- I see.

330
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,375
It helps me address them directly.
Forms a better trust.

331
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,458
Here's us, all together.

332
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:13,416
There's dear Missy. There.

333
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:16,125
And the tall one, Tammy.

334
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:18,791
And that's sweet Claire.

335
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,875
She was such a sweet girl.

336
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:23,750
See the teddy.

337
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:26,875
Herman gave her that.

338
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,333
She was the first one to go missing.

339
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:39,208
And that's...

340
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:47,125
Herman. Yes, my son.

341
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,166
The newspapers called him a monster.

342
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:55,791
But he was my boy.

343
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,625
Your mind is a powerful thing.

344
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,250
- If you fill it with powerful thoughts...
- Fuck!

345
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,583
...your life will start to change.

346
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:11,625
You can't always control
what happens in life,

347
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:15,875
but you can always control
what happens in your mind.

348
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:21,583
If you can control your mind,
you can control your attitude

349
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,125
and how you handle a situation.

350
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:28,083
Then you can begin
to control the situation.

351
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:31,750
Repeat your goal in your mind.

352
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:33,625
Visualize it.

353
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,208
Make it happen.

354
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,583
Be proactive.

355
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:42,333
Take charge and remember
that you are amazing.

356
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

357
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,791
Mrs. Green says skip
the East Hall due to repairs,

358
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,000
so that helps us,

359
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:23,666
but we'll need to pick
our staging areas carefully.

360
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:27,916
Otherwise we'll wind up here till Friday
trying to make this feel legit. Got it?

361
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,125
Okay. so let's just start
with the areas she's comfortable with

362
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,958
- and take it from there.
- Yeah, I'll go hook the mikes up.

363
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:36,583
- Okay. You got those new voices, right?
- Yeah.

364
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,916
- Beautiful.
- And wait for it.

365
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,833
Mrs. Green.

366
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:49,041
Love it. All right, so, babe, I'll give
you a tap when it's time to cue Elliot.

367
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:52,083
We'll start with giggling
and then amp it up from there.

368
00:34:58,583 --> 00:34:59,625
Ange...

369
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,041
your nose is bleeding.

370
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:05,833
Excuse me.

371
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,291
You're okay. You're okay.

372
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

373
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,000
Why are you creeping up on me?

374
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,666
'Cause I'm a creep.

375
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,166
You all right?

376
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,500
What was that?

377
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:31,541
Ange...

378
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What are you doing?

379
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,833
Ange, what's going on?

380
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,708
Angela.

381
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,000
Ange...

382
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,125
Can you hear me?

383
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,458
What happened? Did she fall?

384
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:45,500
I'm okay.

385
00:37:45,791 --> 00:37:50,458
She said she heard something,
and then, I don't know if she crashed out.

386
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:55,000
Maybe... Maybe we should just go, you know?
You know, come back...

387
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:57,166
- She's said she's fine.
- But she just passed out.

388
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,375
I'm... I'm okay.

389
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:01,166
Okay, good.

390
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,458
Let's get back to it then.

391
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:06,833
Do you need anything?

392
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,208
- ... Can I have some water, please?
- Yeah.

393
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,083
El, get the gear.

394
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,375
Get the gear.

395
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:21,541
Thank you.

396
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:26,958
Are you all right?

397
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:33,208
You know I love you, right?

398
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,500
I know I can be a dick but,

399
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,333
I do love you.

400
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:41,791
Don't forget that. Don't ever forget.

401
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:45,583
Come on.

402
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,250
Yeah, I'm all plugged in up here, so...

403
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:00,625
Can I ask how
this is all going to work, exactly?

404
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:02,583
Yeah, sure.

405
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:06,208
First,

406
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,416
Angela's going to sweep the house.

407
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:15,541
That might take some time but when
she establishes a connection and...

408
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:16,625
Jackson...

409
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:24,916
Is this your usual routine
for all your clients?

410
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,291
It's not up yet.

411
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,041
Stop the showmanship.

412
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,291
I'll check the wires you were after.

413
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,041
Sure.

414
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,916
Must be lovely
to be working with your sister.

415
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:51,291
Family together. There's no greater joy.

416
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,125
What's happening?

417
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:59,166
We're waiting on them.

418
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:04,583
You saw something.

419
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,250
What is it? What did you see?

420
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:16,083
I'll believe you if you tell me.

421
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:21,708
Okay.

422
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:25,625
The only reason...

423
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:31,375
I said I'd do this, I like my gadgets,
but when I found out...

424
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,958
you was doing it,
I thought it was pretty cool.

425
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:39,250
I thought it was pretty cool
to hang out with you.

426
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,625
Is it obvious?

427
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,708
- A little bit.
- Yeah.

428
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:46,791
A big bit.

429
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:48,416
Um...

430
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,333
We're ready. All feeds are live.

431
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,125
Okay.

432
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,625
Ready?

433
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:59,666
Are we filming something today
or not? Can't remember.

434
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,750
Okay. Hold on.

435
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,875
Three little donkeys
went up a tree,

436
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:14,041
and none of them listened to me.

437
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:18,291
Okay.

438
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:20,166
Starting in the north hall.

439
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:37,375
Ange will normally tell us
exactly the specifics of the voices

440
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:41,291
- and what she hears.
- Can you see from her face?

441
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:45,458
I can normally tell.
The girls, if they're talking to her.

442
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:47,875
They'll be able to tell her
where they are,

443
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:50,208
they'll lead Ange to them.

444
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:53,083
And when they've made the connection,

445
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:58,791
they'll be able to discuss further
what action will be taken.

446
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:01,041
So that they can leave the house.

447
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,500
- One by one?
- One by one.

448
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:09,833
That's how she does it.
She'll make contact with each of them

449
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:13,666
and ask them one by one to leave.

450
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,833
Claire.

451
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:51,458
Missy.

452
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:54,458
Tammy.

453
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,375
My name is Angela Sayers.

454
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:02,916
Mrs. Green has called me here.

455
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:06,208
I've come to see
if you'd consider leaving this house.

456
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:43,625
You hear that?

457
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:46,458
What?

458
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:56,625
I'll check these out.

459
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,083
Something's here.

460
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,041
Elliot, where's she going?

461
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:45,333
Who sings for the dead only?

462
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:01,791
Tammy.

463
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:04,458
You really don't see her?

464
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,541
I can't see anything.

465
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:20,833
She wants us to follow her.

466
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:23,666
Okay.

467
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,041
Where are they going?

468
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:30,583
Ange, can you sense a presence?

469
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,625
Are they going to the East Wing?

470
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,291
Can we stick to the plan, guys?

471
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:55,500
Elliot, what's happening?

472
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,583
Ange, you copy?

473
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:24,958
Turn back.

474
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:32,375
Tammy?

475
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:34,791
Where are you?

476
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,833
What are you guys doing over there?

477
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:41,958
Elliot!

478
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:43,125
What happened?

479
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:46,250
- Ange, what's going on?
- Shit!

480
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:49,958
Jackson, the floor just gave away,
he fell... Shit.

481
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:52,333
Elliot, can you hear me?

482
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:54,375
Jackson, he's not answering.

483
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:56,791
I think he's hurt bad. Okay, Elliot...

484
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:58,166
- We should go help.
- No.

485
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,375
- This is bad, Jackson...
- I'll go check.

486
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,333
Elliot, talk to me please.

487
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:11,458
Stay there.

488
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:24,041
Elliott, can you hear me?

489
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:26,291
Are you okay?

490
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:29,708
Elliot?

491
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,208
It's my ankle.
I heard something pop.

492
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:33,916
Shit! It hurts!

493
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:43,416
Fuck!

494
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,041
El? El, talk to me.

495
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:49,875
- Humpty Dumpty...
- Everything's going to be okay.

496
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:50,791
...sat on a wall,

497
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:53,166
- Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
- Jackson's coming.

498
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:55,583
All the King's horses
and all the King's men...

499
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:07,916
What are you guys up to?

500
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:13,583
- El, you alive, man?
- Yes.

501
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:16,541
I think I'm going to need
to go to hospital though.

502
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,000
We'll get you outtta there.
Just hold tight.

503
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,208
Did you call for help?

504
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:24,583
We're going to have to carry him up,
all right. We'll just keep going.

505
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:27,500
- We need to finish this job.
- Jackson.

506
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:31,500
If we call an ambulance here...

507
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,958
- We're screwed.
- Dammit, Jackson. It's Elliot.

508
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:36,208
Is El okay?

509
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,500
Can you ask Mrs. Green
if we can find a ladder?

510
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:44,416
Okay.

511
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:48,791
And maybe a rope.

512
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:59,500
- What, you don't trust me?
- The maple tree behind East Hills?

513
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:01,000
I was 12.

514
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:03,583
Yeah, well, my knee
still clicks weird when I walk.

515
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:07,416
This is great. I love working with you.

516
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,125
Hold it.

517
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:13,791
It's okay. It's okay.

518
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:20,208
Ew. That's fucked.

519
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,375
At least he wasn't faking it.

520
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:55,458
Jackson...

521
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,458
The girls were kept down here.

522
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:27,833
Jesus Christ.

523
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:39,166
Look at the mouth.

524
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:41,333
She wanted us to find it.

525
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,791
Who?

526
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:44,833
Tammy.

527
00:50:46,166 --> 00:50:48,958
And Tammy is...

528
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:51,250
Okay...

529
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:53,791
I know this sounds nuts.

530
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:58,333
But ever since our last gig,
I have been...

531
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:00,458
seeing things.

532
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:02,041
Jackson, I'm not joking.

533
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:04,250
She might be right.

534
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:08,416
It could even be Herman's ghost,
running around here,

535
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,708
- trying to kill us all off for revenge.
- I saw those girls.

536
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,375
And their mouths are sewn up,
just like the story said.

537
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:17,375
Ange, it's just a house.

538
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:21,583
We're in a basement
and someone was doodling on the wall.

539
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:24,625
- That's all there is to it.
- She led us right here.

540
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:27,375
It's no coincidence
that we ended up down here.

541
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:29,083
I don't think it's a coincidence.

542
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:32,291
I don't think any of this
is a coincidence. Us being in here,

543
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:34,875
in life, in general,
none of it is a coincidence.

544
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,458
Good talk. Let's get up.

545
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,958
Hey, buddy.
Drop the camera, will you?

546
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,083
- El, drop the camera.
- Jackson.

547
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:54,000
This is my responsibility.

548
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:06,166
Okay.

549
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,083
All right.

550
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:12,333
Let's finish the job.

551
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:15,708
Fuck you, Jackson,
and fuck this scamming shit.

552
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:16,666
I'm done.

553
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:19,541
You've got a serious attitude problem.

554
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:21,333
I know what I saw.

555
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,708
You've fucking lost it, Ange.

556
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,041
Quit the jokes, Jackson.

557
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,208
You actually believe in this shit now?

558
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,708
Believe in it?
This was all your idea.

559
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:42,291
If you just stuck to the script
instead of wandering off

560
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:43,625
like a crazy person...

561
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:47,416
I'm not crazy.
The girls are real, this is real.

562
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,500
Are you being our friend?

563
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,791
Jackson,
they're trying to tell us something.

564
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:54,083
- Angela.
- You sound just like Mom.

565
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:56,000
Well, maybe Mom wasn't crazy either.

566
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,083
Jackson.

567
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:29,416
Hey. Mrs. Green,
we're just having a slight hiccup.

568
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,750
Nothing to worry about.

569
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,000
Hey.

570
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:46,041
We're going to cleanse this house.

571
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:47,416
I promise you.

572
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:51,375
I'm afraid you have failed.

573
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,875
Mrs. Green, I assure you
we'll be able to get the voices out.

574
00:53:58,666 --> 00:53:59,791
You have my word.

575
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:02,875
- No way...
- Be quiet.

576
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:07,583
I really thought you could help me.

577
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:10,125
It's not real, is it?

578
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,916
Any of it. It's all an act.

579
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:17,375
Angela's gift.

580
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:22,291
I thought if you could hear the voices too
you'd be able to stop them.

581
00:54:27,041 --> 00:54:30,083
I want you out of here immediately.

582
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:33,708
It is real.

583
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,916
Everything.

584
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,416
Everything.

585
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:42,708
But you can't control the unseen, okay?

586
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:50,166
I wanted to give them a happy future.

587
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,666
I tried to give them everything.

588
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,500
So that maybe they'd thank me later,

589
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:59,041
and think of me as their mother.

590
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:01,708
But they wouldn't listen to me.

591
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:03,791
They would not be quiet.

592
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:06,833
Herman was a sweet boy.

593
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:11,250
The girls were to blame, not him.

594
00:55:12,791 --> 00:55:14,583
Those little monsters...

595
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,583
Beth, pack up. We're getting
the fuck out of here.

596
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,500
It's like...

597
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,500
I don't even think you're a freak.

598
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:39,541
And I know that everyone at uni

599
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:42,041
obviously thinks you're a bit weird.

600
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:45,916
That's kind of something
I always liked about you.

601
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,500
You know...

602
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:52,708
Ange, pick up.

603
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:56,375
Jackson.

604
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,458
I'm coming to get you and Elliot.

605
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:02,166
Beth, we're leaving.

606
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:03,958
Angela...

607
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:16,250
Angela.

608
00:56:32,416 --> 00:56:33,375
Beth?

609
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:38,291
Jackson.

610
00:57:50,916 --> 00:57:52,166
Jackson!

611
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:56,666
Jackson, get down here now.

612
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:02,958
Beth, meet us at the car.

613
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:05,041
Beth?

614
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:07,250
- No, no, stop!
- Beth, can you hear me?

615
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:08,416
Meet us at the car!

616
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,666
Get up, now.

617
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:15,375
Elliot.

618
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:17,416
Come on.

619
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:21,458
- Come on.
- No.

620
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:23,583
Beth?

621
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:27,250
Beth?

622
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:30,375
Beth, where are you?

623
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:34,458
Beth, can you hear me?

624
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,500
Ange, what are you doing?

625
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:52,000
Is that...?

626
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Beth.

627
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:16,875
Did you see her?

628
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:23,583
Beth, where are you?

629
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:27,375
I need to follow her.

630
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:30,500
Take Elliot and meet us at the car.

631
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:33,333
I love you. I'm sorry.

632
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:38,208
But we're supposed to stick together.
Jackson!

633
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:57,958
I found you.

634
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:21,958
Beth.

635
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:29,916
Beth. Beth, baby.

636
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:34,458
You okay?

637
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:39,458
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

638
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:41,750
We're gonna get you up. It's okay.

639
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,125
No.

640
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,500
Elliot? Elliot, wake up.

641
01:02:08,916 --> 01:02:10,583
Okay, come on. Come on.

642
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

643
01:02:51,583 --> 01:02:52,916
Get the door!

644
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:58,083
Who did this to her?

645
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:04,791
Who did this to her?

646
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,875
Jackson, what happened?

647
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:09,458
Give me the keys, Ange!

648
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:29,583
Jackson.

649
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:34,875
Beth. No.

650
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:38,208
Beth.

651
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:44,250
I'm sorry.

652
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:54,041
I'm sorry.

653
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:57,166
Fuck!

654
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:13,750
No, no, no, please!

655
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:16,166
Please, no!

656
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,666
Please, please!

657
01:05:22,291 --> 01:05:24,041
No, no!

658
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:13,875
Jackson?

659
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:38,458
Okay. Okay.

660
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:40,833
Elliot, come on. roll over.

661
01:06:40,916 --> 01:06:43,750
Over, come on. Over.

662
01:06:44,916 --> 01:06:46,375
Come on.

663
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:50,041
El, you need to wake up, okay?

664
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:52,583
El, come on.

665
01:06:52,666 --> 01:06:54,708
Hey, where's Jackson?

666
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:58,208
Elliot, where is my brother?

667
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:05,458
He took him.

668
01:07:06,541 --> 01:07:07,625
Who took him?

669
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,500
Elliott. Who?

670
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:11,708
He took him.

671
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:40,000
Dear. We have woken you.

672
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:46,666
We do apologize
about your pretty little girlfriend.

673
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:49,041
You see...

674
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,291
I could not risk having
the wolves at my door.

675
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:56,333
Not again.

676
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:02,666
Angela.

677
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,666
My mother taught me well.

678
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:34,583
She'd use the belt on me.

679
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,833
Garden sheers.

680
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:42,875
She'd burn my privates.

681
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,750
If those girls had just listened.

682
01:09:58,625 --> 01:09:59,583
Claire?

683
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

684
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:31,833
Hold still.

685
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,375
This part is very tricky.

686
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:46,500
Hold still.

687
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,333
Shh!

688
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:53,541
It's quiet time now.

689
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,250
God.

690
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:33,416
You remind me of my girls.

691
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:42,791
They wouldn't stop talking.

692
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:45,958
Whispering around the house.

693
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:49,000
I told them.

694
01:11:49,791 --> 01:11:52,083
Every family has secrets.

695
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:56,583
But after little Claire...

696
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:00,250
they had to be silenced.

697
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:04,625
Hush, now.

698
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:09,291
There. All over.

699
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,750
Now go and get the others.

700
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

701
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,500
Herman.

702
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:37,458
Stop staring at her.

703
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:30,250
I'm so sorry.

704
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:35,208
I'm so sorry I couldn't help you.

705
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:57,708
Look what you and
your brother have made me do, Angela.

706
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:02,208
- It was all an act, wasn't it?
- Mrs. Green.

707
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:04,333
Please let us go.

708
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:08,416
You know I can't do that.

709
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,083
Herman, take him to the shed.

710
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:19,500
After you've dealt with him,
bring back the other boy.

711
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:21,458
No, no.

712
01:15:22,166 --> 01:15:25,416
No. Don't you fucking touch him! No.

713
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:27,958
Jackson, no, no! No!

714
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,833
He's the only thing I have left.

715
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:32,666
Fucking bitch!

716
01:15:43,916 --> 01:15:45,000
Shh.

717
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:46,125
Hush now.

718
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:36,625
Shh, shh, shh!

719
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:38,500
Hold still.

720
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:13,333
Leave her alone.

721
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,416
Herman, grab him.

722
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:26,125
That's it, hold him!

723
01:17:31,916 --> 01:17:33,666
Herman?

724
01:17:36,708 --> 01:17:37,791
Herman!

725
01:17:55,291 --> 01:17:57,833
Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Hey.

726
01:17:58,333 --> 01:18:01,041
It's all right, Mommy's here.

727
01:18:01,125 --> 01:18:03,416
I'm here for you.
I'm here. I'm here, okay?

728
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,458
I'll not let anything happen to you.
I promise.

729
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:06,583
Herman.

730
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,250
No!

731
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,916
No!

732
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:27,125
He was all I had left!

733
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:31,583
No! Stop!

734
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,500
You hurt my boy.

735
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:39,791
Stop!

736
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:42,666
Leave him alone.

737
01:18:44,583 --> 01:18:46,333
He was my boy.

738
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:48,666
Please help.

739
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:52,541
Help us, please.

740
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:54,625
Please, please, help us!

741
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:56,625
Help him please!

742
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:00,583
Please, help us!

743
01:19:04,416 --> 01:19:07,250
Now it's your turn to be quiet.

744
01:19:10,416 --> 01:19:11,458
Please!

745
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:13,875
Please!

746
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:50,041
No!

747
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:37,125
I'm gonna go get help. Okay?

748
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:40,291
- Yeah.
- Okay.

749
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:39,458
Jackson?

750
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:43,291
Jackson?

751
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,416
Hey.

752
01:21:50,458 --> 01:21:51,541
Have you seen Beth?

753
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:57,083
I can't find her.

754
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:20,958
Angela...

755
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,416
It's okay to see him now.

756
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:44,583
Hey.

757
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:46,458
Hey.

758
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:57,666
It's a curse.

759
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:01,500
I should have seen it.

760
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:04,791
It's my fault.

761
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:07,500
There's nothing you could have done.

762
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:10,166
Jackson, he...

763
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:11,833
I'm coming over.

764
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:22,125
You can't be alone now, Angela.

765
01:24:31,791 --> 01:24:33,041
I'm not alone.
