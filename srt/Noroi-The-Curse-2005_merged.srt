1
00:00:01,428 --> 00:00:04,420
"The names of persons and
organizations in this movie"

2
00:00:04,564 --> 00:00:07,727
"have been partially changed."

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,634
"Produced by Taka Ichise"

4
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:21,504
"Directed by Koji Shiraishi"

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,418
This video documentary is deemed
too disturbing for public viewing.

6
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,093
These are books written by
Masafumi Kobayashi, a journalist

7
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:47,103
who had been chronicling
supernatural phenomenon since 1995.

8
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:52,300
He gathered accounts
of strange occurrences...

9
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:56,472
in his pursuit of horrifying and
unsolvable mysteries.

10
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:01,787
Once he'd begun using video
in his research

11
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:05,982
he was able to compile his research
on to videotapes.

12
00:01:07,594 --> 00:01:08,822
That bomb shelter?

13
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:11,157
Yes. It's in there.

14
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:16,836
I saw it over there.

15
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:20,971
It running in the woods very quickly

16
00:01:21,474 --> 00:01:25,410
This is where you saw the ghost...

17
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:26,477
Was it suicide?

18
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:29,946
Yes. I saw him in the fender mirror.

19
00:01:32,452 --> 00:01:33,783
This is where...

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,482
a family of five was massacred.

21
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:45,389
In April 2004...

22
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:48,527
Kobayashi finished his latest...

23
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:50,693
video documentary, "The Curse".

24
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:52,404
This has to have some connection.

25
00:01:53,873 --> 00:01:56,637
But soon after that...

26
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,647
At night on April 12,
Kobayashi's house burned down.

27
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:24,498
Later his wife, Keiko was found dead
in the remains.

28
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:30,809
But Kobayashi wasn't found.
He was declared missing.

29
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:36,674
Masafumi Kobayashi
had mysteriously vanished.

30
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:40,884
His video, "The Curse"...

31
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:45,958
reveals a truth too astounding
for us to imagine.

32
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:20,824
"I want the truth."

33
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,952
"No matter how terrifying
I want the truth."

34
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:28,132
"Masafumi Kobayashi."

35
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:49,614
"November 12, 2002, Koganei, Tokyo"

36
00:03:53,092 --> 00:03:56,858
"Masafumi Kobayashi,
reporter of the supernatural."

37
00:03:59,165 --> 00:04:04,432
The spooky voices you mentioned...
What kind of voices were they?

38
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:09,407
It sounded like babies' voices.

39
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,339
Babies' voices...

40
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:13,602
"Ryoko Okui, housewife"

41
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:15,941
When did it start?

42
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:20,218
A couple of months ago.

43
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:30,456
The sound comes from over there.

44
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,565
Who lives next door?

45
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:39,796
A woman in her 40s and her boy,
aged between 6 and 9.

46
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:41,406
There are two of them.

47
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:46,111
They moved in about half a year ago.

48
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:49,942
That was the only time that
I saw the boy.

49
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,483
I haven't seen him since.

50
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:58,116
I see the mother every now and then
when she goes out.

51
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,282
But she doesn't greet me.

52
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,924
I'm a bit scared. I don't want
my girl involved, either.

53
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:11,427
Let's go to the neighbor's.

54
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:25,676
Let's go in.

55
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:31,081
What a mess!

56
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:37,827
Hello?

57
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,566
Anybody home?

58
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:57,740
I happened to be in the neighborhood
doing some research and...

59
00:05:57,884 --> 00:06:00,011
What kind of way is that
to talk to me?

60
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,887
How can you talk to me like that?

61
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:11,719
May I have a few minutes
of your time...

62
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:13,161
How can you?

63
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:16,830
My name's Kobayashi and...

64
00:06:22,575 --> 00:06:23,735
Impossible.

65
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,440
Give me a break.

66
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:58,439
"The strange sound was recorded
on video tape."

67
00:07:01,614 --> 00:07:03,081
Let's begin.

68
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:10,651
Can you tell us what the sonic
analysis revealed?

69
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,052
Okay.

70
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:16,158
We have the spectrographic analysis
of the sound.

71
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:19,798
It has a band of noise
all the way through it.

72
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:23,163
But here, there's a unique signal.

73
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,470
I'll play it back for comparison.

74
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,236
"The unprocessed audio signal."

75
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:36,139
This one's noise-reduced.

76
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:42,810
"The processed audio signal."

77
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:48,583
As you can hear it's like
some kind of animal sound.

78
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:52,493
I have enhanced the signal.

79
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:54,656
Listen carefully.

80
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:05,836
A cat meows sequentially
but this sound isn't like that.

81
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:09,846
What's interesting about
this sound is...

82
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:15,616
that it doesn't repeat like a cat's
meow, it ends with an inhale.

83
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:19,222
That's the characteristic of
a human baby voice.

84
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:21,519
On closer examination

85
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:27,566
it sounds like the voices of
more than 5 babies.

86
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:34,131
Several days after your visit...

87
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:38,869
they moved out of that house.

88
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:43,075
What? They moved out?

89
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:47,275
How about the strange voices?

90
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,888
Do you still hear the baby voices?

91
00:08:50,222 --> 00:08:55,091
Not since they moved out.

92
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:23,417
So her name is Junko Ishii.

93
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:41,963
Come here, Miyajima!

94
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:07,094
Excuse us now.

95
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,246
They died 5 days later.

96
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,891
Mrs. Okui lost control of her car
when she was driving.

97
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:38,529
The car went over the divider
into the incoming traffic...

98
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:54,911
"Footage from a TV variety program,
aired on August 3, 2003"

99
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:56,977
Good evening, everybody!

100
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:58,377
Good evening.

101
00:10:58,517 --> 00:10:59,814
Very good, everybody.

102
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,250
Let me introduce you to

103
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:05,221
Mr. Koichi Hirotsu, the psychic.

104
00:11:05,357 --> 00:11:07,484
Thank you very much.

105
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,925
Can you tell us
how the experiment proceeds?

106
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:17,662
The first experiment deals
with clairvoyance.

107
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,538
"Experiment 1, Clairvoyance"

108
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:23,268
In each of these containers

109
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:26,207
there's a piece of paper.

110
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:28,336
It has a drawing on it.

111
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:31,609
I want you to imagine what's drawn.

112
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:33,776
"First question"

113
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:38,023
10 children with ESP abilities
from all over Japan.

114
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,724
We're about to witness their powers!

115
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:44,589
They all look kind of nervous.

116
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:53,467
Everybody, concentrate right here.

117
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,870
Try to envision the paper
in the container.

118
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,536
You'll get a vision in your head.

119
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:04,244
None of us know...

120
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:06,544
what's drawn on the paper.

121
00:12:15,594 --> 00:12:19,587
One of them is starting
to draw what she sees.

122
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:23,566
"One of them is starting
to draw what she sees"

123
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,229
Can she really see it?

124
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:31,207
Let's open the container

125
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:33,208
and take a look at the paper.

126
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,012
What's on the paper?

127
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:45,379
The answer is a double circle.

128
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:47,822
But not just a double circle.

129
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,294
Each circle has two points

130
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,797
where the line is broken.

131
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:56,925
It's a complicated shape.

132
00:12:57,102 --> 00:12:58,364
Did anybody get it right?

133
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:00,806
"Results"

134
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:07,367
You there...

135
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,104
She got it right!

136
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:11,015
Kana Yano

137
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:13,374
can you show us what you drew?

138
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:18,179
Take a good look, everybody.

139
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:23,457
It's drawn with extreme accuracy.

140
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:28,700
Even the scale is accurate.

141
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:31,803
This is incredible!

142
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:34,132
Kana Yano...

143
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:36,969
She gave correct answers to

144
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,737
all the questions up to 4.

145
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:42,375
"Fifth question"

146
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:46,175
Will Kana give an correct answer
to the fifth question, too?

147
00:13:50,723 --> 00:13:54,819
Kana's already drawing something.

148
00:13:56,862 --> 00:13:58,887
"Results"

149
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:02,033
Show us what you've got, everybody.

150
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:12,400
The answer to the question
looks like this.

151
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:14,034
It's totally different.

152
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:17,539
"It means Star in Russian"

153
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,855
I guess this one was difficult.

154
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,684
Maybe she's tired.

155
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:31,625
Next we'll make water materialize
in sealed bottles.

156
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:35,762
It's called materialization.

157
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:42,231
It is done by telekinetically
envisioning water in the bottle.

158
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,267
Let's do it.

159
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:48,513
"Begin experiment"

160
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:55,648
This requires intense concentration.

161
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:57,278
And now...

162
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:02,787
you're about to witness a miracle
performed by Kana!

163
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:08,164
Look, Kana's getting some water!

164
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:13,167
Can you see it?

165
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:16,968
At the bottom of the bottle...
water's gathering out of nowhere!

166
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:25,614
Of course, there's no false bottom
on the bottle, nor the table.

167
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:27,309
It's the same girl again.

168
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,683
What were you thinking

169
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:36,393
when you did this?

170
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,459
I thought about water.

171
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:41,826
When the water materialized...

172
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:45,368
did you feel something different?

173
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:47,028
Were you hot or numb?

174
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:49,037
I had a headache.

175
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,670
My, God!

176
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:55,340
What is this thing?

177
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,412
Some kind of hair?

178
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:03,183
Yes. I guess she materialized it
together with the water.

179
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:08,853
What was it that mysteriously
appeared in the bottle?

180
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:13,188
Tests done on the water
that Kana produced, have come in.

181
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:15,300
"Professor Takaaki Yuhara, DSc"

182
00:16:15,968 --> 00:16:18,163
The major component is water.

183
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:22,739
We found animal plankton
which suggests that

184
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:28,245
it's fresh water from either
a river or a lake.

185
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:33,880
The hair in the water is
indeed that of an animal.

186
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:39,388
It could be human hair, but because
there's no medulla development...

187
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:42,983
it could be from a newborn baby.

Kana's parents."

190
00:17:00,746 --> 00:17:01,713
Hello.

191
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:03,375
Thanks for coming.

192
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:07,142
She's been sleeping all day?

193
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:10,351
Since after lunch.

"Kana Yano,
the psychic who appeared on TV."

195
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:20,089
She's had a slight fever
since those TV experiments.

196
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:24,029
She's spent lots of time
in bed, resting.

197
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:30,602
We took her to the doctor but
he couldn't find anything wrong.

198
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:33,571
We're very concerned about her.

199
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:40,646
I thought the program was pushing
the children too much...

200
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,648
Too many experiments.

201
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:49,159
I wonder if she's exhausted
her powers on that one occasion...

Hello, we're the Ungirls.

204
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:05,170
We're so popular that
ants crawl up our legs in the park.

206
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:12,475
I'm so tall that
I have to hold the coffin myself.

We're the Ungirls.

208
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:19,816
We're on our way to a shrine,
a popular ghost-sighting spot.

209
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:24,019
It was deemed boring if
it was just the two of us.

210
00:18:24,163 --> 00:18:26,495
So we have the actress
Marika Matsumoto here too.

211
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:30,260
Good evening. I'm Marika Matsumoto.

212
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,836
I heard that you have a sixth sense.

213
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:34,336
That's right.

214
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:37,767
Have you ever had any
supernatural experiences?

215
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,708
Yes. Ever since I was a child...

216
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:42,074
For so long?

217
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,942
Yes. I've seen apparitions.

218
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,215
Are you okay, Marika?

219
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:51,016
I don't know...
The back of my neck's tingling.

220
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:53,855
You feel tingly?

221
00:18:54,493 --> 00:18:55,721
I'm scared...

222
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:57,886
Maybe we shouldn't go in there?

223
00:18:58,163 --> 00:19:01,826
But that's what we are here for,
so we're going in.

224
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:05,865
Here we are!

225
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:08,665
You want to go in?

226
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,368
It's spooky...

227
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:18,378
Guys! I feel something over
in that direction.

228
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:22,310
I feel something really strange...

229
00:19:22,854 --> 00:19:24,048
This way.

230
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,821
We'd better stay here.

231
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,755
Let's all go in together.

232
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,986
It feels very strange...

233
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:34,760
But there's nothing here.

234
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,960
Maybe it's here... Yes, it is.

235
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:40,697
Can you bring the camera over here?

236
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:44,640
Only these trees are dead.

237
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:47,644
Everywhere else the trees are okay.

238
00:19:47,913 --> 00:19:49,574
They're okay there, too.

239
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:52,510
Only here, they're dead.

240
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:55,884
Look at this tree. So lumpy.

241
00:19:56,288 --> 00:20:00,281
Yuck...
It's dripping with something sticky.

242
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:04,095
What's this?
Is it oozing from the tree?

243
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:05,729
No! Don't touch it!

244
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:10,935
I mean it. Stay back...

245
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:12,734
Is it bad?

246
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:17,438
Shit!

247
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:19,941

249
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:26,979
Did you hear that?

250
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,518
Did I? I heard nothing...

251
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:33,624
Something... lt was a low voice,
like a man's.

252
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,056
A man's voice?

253
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,388
Was that you?

254
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:41,791
I've had enough of this.

255
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:51,334
There's nothing over there.

Wasn't that something special?

259
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:37,480
It was incredible. I was blown away.

260
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:40,054
How do you feel now, Marika?

261
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:43,220
I feel embarrassed.

262
00:21:44,196 --> 00:21:47,654
So this footage was edited out?

263
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:54,534
That's right. The director arranged
for me to have a copy.

264
00:21:54,673 --> 00:22:00,873
In the footage, you said you could
hear a man's voice.

265
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:04,239
It was a very low voice.

266
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:10,014
It sounded like it was calling me.

267
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:14,386
Did you see me turn
when I heard the voice?

268
00:22:15,694 --> 00:22:19,425
I remember nothing
from that point on.

269
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:21,498
Nothing at all?

Let's hear it for him!

Calm down, he's our guest.

276
00:23:04,543 --> 00:23:10,072
Our guest has arrived in
an outfit that's very different.

277
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:14,512

Come this way.

give us your impression of Marika.

ectoplasmic worms.

at the door.

follow his thoughts...

I edited something out.

these images unconsciously.

these patterns?

act strangely recently...

It's strange.

- Yes!

I think he's a freaking psycho.

361
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:13,237
I saw him several times
putting out the garbage...

362
00:30:14,572 --> 00:30:15,539
He's a freaking psycho.

363
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:17,038
He can't be cured.

364
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:21,402
So he's a freaking psycho.

365
00:30:26,317 --> 00:30:27,784
Is this it?

366
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:38,621
"Strange messages on the garbage"

367
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:44,629
Hello! Is the super psychic home?

368
00:30:52,443 --> 00:30:55,606
Are you the super psychic?

369
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:08,788
Mitsuo Hori...

370
00:31:11,696 --> 00:31:12,958
I can do that.

371
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:16,860
I'm psychic.

372
00:31:18,202 --> 00:31:23,162
Could I interview you?

373
00:31:32,383 --> 00:31:35,352
Is it alright?

374
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:39,520
I'm coming inside.

375
00:31:41,893 --> 00:31:45,920
Can you see this?
We've got to show this!

376
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:51,724
The room's covered entirely
with aluminum foil!

377
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:55,737
Hundreds of fliers are
stored in these boxes.

378
00:31:57,275 --> 00:32:03,145
What's written on these fliers?
I mean...

379
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:05,579
What are they for?

380
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:12,011
For years, I've been receiving
dangerous information...

381
00:32:12,156 --> 00:32:14,249
Dangerous messages...

382
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:16,687
Space...

383
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:18,955
What?

384
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:22,192
- Space!
- Space!

385
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,395
With space...

386
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,895
I can connect...

387
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,339
I can see the future...

388
00:32:34,946 --> 00:32:37,608
Many bad, bad guys...

389
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,686
Ectoplasmic worms...

390
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:47,748
It says so here.
"Ectoplasmic worms."

391
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:53,496
The worms are all over,
crawling, squirming...

392
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:08,568
The super psychic's expressing
himself with body language.

393
00:33:09,814 --> 00:33:12,408
Is that his expression for
the ectoplasmic worms?

394
00:33:15,753 --> 00:33:18,085
"December 22"

395
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:35,804
Was anything out of the ordinary
around the time that Kana vanished?

396
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,543
For about a week
before she disappeared...

397
00:33:40,845 --> 00:33:48,945
there was a man
who kept visiting her.

398
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:54,318
I had no idea
what he was talking about.

399
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:05,829
He was wearing a hat covered with
aluminum foil.

400
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:08,534
And also...

401
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:14,407
he had a long coat covered with
aluminum foil.

402
00:34:15,546 --> 00:34:19,380
And for some reason, Kana told me...

403
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:25,717
that the man was
of no threat to her...

404
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:28,855
On the day that Kana disappeared...

405
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:36,225
We found this strange flier.
It was placed face down.

406
00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:42,437
It says, "Help."
I think this is Kana's handwriting.

407
00:34:43,774 --> 00:34:46,140
See what Kana drew on this?

408
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:50,373
Has she always drawn
this kind of pattern?

409
00:34:50,581 --> 00:34:55,041
"Kana's parents said they'd never
seen anything like this before."

410
00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:57,051
"Help."

411
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:16,537
"The worms are increasing.
If we don't deal with them..."

412
00:35:19,277 --> 00:35:22,474
Hello, is Mr. Hori home?

413
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,448
Excuse me.

414
00:35:35,459 --> 00:35:39,452
I'm a journalist
doing some research.

415
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,996
Can you help me with my research
into the missing girl, Kana?

416
00:35:45,436 --> 00:35:46,698
Who are you?

417
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:49,965
My name is Kobayashi.

418
00:35:50,408 --> 00:35:53,707
I believe we met on the talkshow
the other night.

419
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:01,845
What?

420
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:03,414
Come in!

421
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:11,051
Oh, excuse me.

422
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:20,970
What's with
the aluminum on the walls?

423
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:23,732
Why are you covered with it?

424
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:30,404
It protects me from the tingling.

425
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:36,611
Because the ectoplasmic worms
are near...

426
00:36:37,955 --> 00:36:41,152
What are these ectoplasmic worms?

427
00:36:45,763 --> 00:36:48,994
These horrible worms...

428
00:36:50,901 --> 00:36:53,301
they are everywhere.

429
00:36:54,272 --> 00:36:57,935
They eat people and they multiply.

430
00:36:58,276 --> 00:36:59,937
Eat people?

431
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:04,213
Kana...

432
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:07,813
She was eaten, too.

433
00:37:09,153 --> 00:37:10,950
Kana?

434
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:14,085
Mr. Hori.

435
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:20,156
You know something about her,
don't you?

436
00:37:26,337 --> 00:37:28,271
Where is Kana now?

437
00:37:31,242 --> 00:37:35,008
I lost track of where she is...

438
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:43,511
Mr. Hori! Let go of my bag!

439
00:37:43,988 --> 00:37:46,957
Stop it at once!

440
00:37:49,527 --> 00:37:51,688
Kana!

441
00:37:52,296 --> 00:37:54,856
This flier...

442
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:58,897
I picked it up at her house.

443
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,434
What do you know about
her disappearance?

444
00:38:02,973 --> 00:38:04,338
Quiet!

445
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:20,723
Blue...

446
00:38:21,826 --> 00:38:24,158
A blue building...

447
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:26,787
A blue building...

448
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:28,262
Blue?

449
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:33,531
Galvanized iron sheets...

450
00:38:35,005 --> 00:38:36,267
What is it?

451
00:38:36,407 --> 00:38:37,931
Cars...

452
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,934
A parking lot?

453
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:45,810
Is he drawing a map?

454
00:38:46,884 --> 00:38:51,048
The worms are coming out...

455
00:38:51,188 --> 00:38:53,122
The worms?

456
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:55,357
The worms are coming out.

457
00:38:56,694 --> 00:39:01,791
A young man...

458
00:39:05,002 --> 00:39:06,731
A young man.

459
00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:12,034
The worms took Kana away.

460
00:39:12,376 --> 00:39:15,675
They took her away!

461
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:36,966
To that direction?

462
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:41,494
Wait a second, Mr. Hori.

463
00:39:41,772 --> 00:39:43,569
I have a map for you.

464
00:39:43,707 --> 00:39:46,505
This is where we are.

465
00:39:46,644 --> 00:39:49,238
That way!

466
00:39:52,283 --> 00:39:54,308
I can't read the map...

467
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,144
Did he say that way?

468
00:40:03,828 --> 00:40:06,422
What's Kagutaba?

469
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:10,258
Kagu... What did you say?

470
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,369
Calm down, Mr. Hori!

471
00:40:20,578 --> 00:40:22,808
Are you okay?

472
00:40:29,153 --> 00:40:31,678
Calm down!

473
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,114
Go away!

474
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,001
Excuse us!

475
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:56,907
Something weird happened
to the video image...

476
00:40:57,882 --> 00:40:59,406
What do you mean, "weird"?

477
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:40,582
"Kobayashi looked for Kana according
to the map of Mitsuo Hori."

478
00:41:40,724 --> 00:41:43,591
Mr. Kobayashi, how about that
apartment over there?

479
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:46,323
There is a parking lot.

480
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:51,324
But they're in different positions.

481
00:41:51,902 --> 00:41:53,893
That's a blue building.

482
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:57,770
But it has only two stories.

483
00:41:58,375 --> 00:41:59,637
This isn't it.

484
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:11,420
This is difficult.

485
00:42:12,556 --> 00:42:14,649
Hello, this is Marika Matsumoto.

486
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:18,961
I have something I want to show you.

487
00:42:19,129 --> 00:42:20,153
What is it?

488
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,393
"December 26, Meguro, Tokyo"

489
00:42:25,536 --> 00:42:29,973
I wanted to show you these loops.

490
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:36,135
When I woke up yesterday morning,
I found the yarn.

491
00:42:36,947 --> 00:42:41,509
And the wool was tied into
these complicated knots.

492
00:42:41,652 --> 00:42:44,382
With many loops.

493
00:42:44,555 --> 00:42:50,255
I don't recall putting the yarn here
before I went to bed.

494
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:54,824
I don't remember tying the wool
in knots, either.

495
00:42:55,132 --> 00:42:59,967
Something must have happened
while I was asleep.

496
00:43:00,504 --> 00:43:04,406
I'm scared to fall asleep now...

497
00:43:04,608 --> 00:43:07,338
I'll leave the camera plugged in.

498
00:43:07,478 --> 00:43:10,106
Turn it on when you go to bed.

499
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:12,178
Okay.

500
00:43:21,992 --> 00:43:25,587
"Later that night"

501
00:44:45,943 --> 00:44:48,741
And you never woke up until morning?

502
00:44:49,379 --> 00:44:50,744
No.

503
00:44:53,784 --> 00:44:57,845
And you remember nothing after
you fell asleep initially?

504
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:00,686
No, I don't.

505
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:18,433
These loops look just like
the ones on the wool.

506
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:20,475
They do...

507
00:45:20,611 --> 00:45:24,206
Very similar...
The way they are tied...

508
00:45:39,797 --> 00:45:46,100
Maybe this is the same banging
noise recorded on the video.

509
00:45:48,338 --> 00:45:50,169
It may be.

510
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:56,175
A girl who works for the same agency
lives upstairs.

511
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,870
Is that right?

512
00:45:58,348 --> 00:46:00,816
How long has it been like this?

513
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:03,148
Lately...

514
00:46:03,287 --> 00:46:05,118
Uh-huh.

515
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:08,815
Sorry to bother you.

516
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:10,984
What's up?

517
00:46:14,031 --> 00:46:15,828
Is this for TV?

518
00:46:15,966 --> 00:46:22,565
Have you been banging on the floor?

519
00:46:23,373 --> 00:46:26,399
What? No, I haven't.

520
00:46:26,543 --> 00:46:28,408
Did you hear a banging sound?

521
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:32,740
I've been here all day,
but I didn't hear anything.

522
00:46:32,883 --> 00:46:34,350
- Didn't you?
- No.

523
00:46:34,618 --> 00:46:37,985
I heard banging...

524
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:44,285
late last night, too.

525
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:48,720
Really? I didn't hear that either.

526
00:46:48,899 --> 00:46:50,230
Are you sure?

527
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:55,004
Have you noticed anything
out of the ordinary recently?

528
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:01,368
Have you felt inexplicably sick?

529
00:47:01,578 --> 00:47:03,170
Anything like that?

530
00:47:04,581 --> 00:47:08,244
No, nothing strange has been
happening in my life.

531
00:47:08,652 --> 00:47:11,280
Sorry. Did we scare you?

532
00:47:11,421 --> 00:47:12,854
No, it's okay.

533
00:47:17,227 --> 00:47:21,129
"January 6, 2004, Nakano, Tokyo"

534
00:47:21,865 --> 00:47:24,834
I didn't know
what this was before...

535
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:27,266
But I think this is a telephone pole

536
00:47:27,404 --> 00:47:31,397
3 stories. Even the number of
windows matches.

537
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:34,567
It's a bluish-colored building, too.

538
00:47:34,778 --> 00:47:36,439
And the room indicated is...

539
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,676
2nd from the right on
the 3rd floor.

540
00:47:40,851 --> 00:47:44,753
The one with garbage bags
on the veranda.

541
00:47:45,422 --> 00:47:47,549
Let's go to the room.

542
00:47:59,503 --> 00:48:01,164
A person named Osawa lives here.

543
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,741
Hello, is Mr. Osawa in?

544
00:48:22,092 --> 00:48:23,491
I can hear something inside.

545
00:48:31,468 --> 00:48:33,197
Excuse me.

546
00:48:33,403 --> 00:48:38,500
Do you know anything about Mr. Osawa
who lives next door?

547
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:42,601
He's a man of about 25.

548
00:48:42,746 --> 00:48:47,342
I barely see him.
He's often talking to himself.

549
00:48:47,484 --> 00:48:52,046
He was also making the banging
sound a while ago.

550
00:48:52,189 --> 00:48:55,420
Did you hear that noise?

551
00:48:55,559 --> 00:49:01,555
Have you ever seen the man
with a girl of...

552
00:49:01,698 --> 00:49:06,658
about 10 years of age?

553
00:49:07,137 --> 00:49:10,334
No, I've never seen him
with a girl.

554
00:49:13,477 --> 00:49:17,641
"January 7"

555
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,351
The pigeons are only on
Osawa's veranda.

556
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:30,084
It's strange.

557
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,020
Keep the camera on the room.

558
00:49:33,163 --> 00:49:34,323
Definitely.

559
00:50:06,897 --> 00:50:09,024
There he is.

560
00:50:27,484 --> 00:50:31,284
"A few days later, Osawa vanished."

561
00:50:40,497 --> 00:50:47,926
There's a strange sound on the
tape of Marika in her room.

562
00:50:48,071 --> 00:50:49,663
I'll play it back.

563
00:51:00,217 --> 00:51:01,241
Around here.

564
00:51:15,265 --> 00:51:17,256
Did you hear that?

565
00:51:21,171 --> 00:51:25,801
"We had the tape analyzed."

566
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:31,810
The original sound's here.
On the right it's processed.

567
00:51:32,115 --> 00:51:33,707
You can compare them.

568
00:51:39,356 --> 00:51:41,881
The noise is reduced
on this recording.

569
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,229
What's Kagutaba?

570
00:52:21,798 --> 00:52:22,924
What do you think?

571
00:52:24,668 --> 00:52:28,399
It actually sounds like...

572
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:35,636
the voice I heard at
the shrine that night.

573
00:52:36,046 --> 00:52:40,574
You mean the shrine
you visited for the TV show?

574
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:42,274
Yes.

575
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:45,087
It sounds just like that voice.

576
00:52:45,922 --> 00:52:50,552
The voice on the tape seems
to be saying, Kagutaba.

577
00:52:50,694 --> 00:52:53,857
Kagutaba?

578
00:52:55,031 --> 00:53:00,264
Does the word Kagutaba
mean anything to you?

579
00:53:02,405 --> 00:53:06,637
No, I don't think so.

580
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,805
I've never heard of it.

581
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,789
"Kobayashi started to look into
the word Kagutaba."

582
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:23,323
It's this word, Kagutaba.

583
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,950
Yes, Kagutaba.

584
00:53:25,362 --> 00:53:31,062
It's far fetched, but you could
speculate that it derives from

585
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:33,931
Kamitama, meaning god's spirit.

586
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,799
I see. God's spirit...

587
00:53:35,939 --> 00:53:40,205
Have you ever heard a foreign word

588
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:42,675
that sounds like Kagutaba?

589
00:53:42,812 --> 00:53:45,406
I can't think of any.

590
00:53:45,548 --> 00:53:47,778
Is this Doctor Shioya?

591
00:53:47,984 --> 00:53:51,317
I'm trying to find out about
a strange word.

592
00:53:51,621 --> 00:53:53,953
The word is Kagutaba.

593
00:53:54,424 --> 00:53:55,391
Kagutaba?

594
00:53:55,525 --> 00:53:57,720
Yes, that's right.

595
00:53:57,861 --> 00:54:00,295
Kagutaba...

596
00:54:02,265 --> 00:54:07,396
I think I saw it in some book
or something.

597
00:54:12,075 --> 00:54:13,667
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

598
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:18,712
Let's get down to business.

599
00:54:18,848 --> 00:54:22,875
The book you mentioned on the phone.

600
00:54:23,186 --> 00:54:24,551
Can I take a look at it?

601
00:54:25,155 --> 00:54:30,559
This is an ethnological document
compiled by the Tokita county office

602
00:54:31,328 --> 00:54:36,425
I found the word Kagutaba
mentioned in this book.

603
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:41,137
There's a town called Shikamimachi
in Tokita county.

604
00:54:41,271 --> 00:54:44,001
Right next to the town

605
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:48,008
there used to be a village called
Shimokage village.

606
00:54:48,211 --> 00:54:51,009
It's now at the bottom of a dam.

607
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:57,645
Before the village's demise
the villagers had a strange custom.

608
00:54:57,787 --> 00:55:00,950
It was called the demon ritual.

609
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:02,820
Demon ritual?

610
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:06,426
It was performed
to pacify the demon.

611
00:55:06,563 --> 00:55:10,829
And according to the book...

612
00:55:11,368 --> 00:55:15,600
The demon was called Kagutaba.

613
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:22,406
Does that mean that Kagutaba
is the name of a demon?

614
00:55:23,179 --> 00:55:28,947
Well, it's difficult to say.
I think that it was just...

615
00:55:29,085 --> 00:55:34,853
convenient for them to call
the unknown entity a demon.

616
00:55:35,859 --> 00:55:41,229
This is a document that is over
200 years old.

617
00:55:42,098 --> 00:55:44,430
It says Kagutaba right here.

618
00:55:44,601 --> 00:55:48,867
The kanji characters for
"disaster, tool and spirit."

619
00:55:49,205 --> 00:55:52,299
The 3 characters make up
the word Kagutaba.

620
00:55:52,675 --> 00:55:57,544
A tool that's capable of causing
disasters.

621
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,443
That's what it means.

622
00:55:59,849 --> 00:56:04,343
A long time ago,
in Shimokage village...

623
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:09,220
there was a group of sorcerers
who migrated from the west.

624
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:14,987
They developed a type of sorcery
called "Shimokage's Way."

625
00:56:15,131 --> 00:56:22,833
One of their spells was called
the "Kagutaba method."

626
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:27,733
The sorcerer performed the spell
to summon Kagutaba...

627
00:56:27,877 --> 00:56:32,712
which was sent to an adversary
to put him under a deadly spell.

628
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:37,684
The document says that
that was the role of Kagutaba.

629
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:41,551
But in one incident,
when a sorcerer summoned Kagutaba...

630
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:45,454
it disobeyed the instructions of
the sorcerer.

631
00:56:46,029 --> 00:56:49,829
It started to do evil things
on its own.

632
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:53,591
So the sorcerer...
performed another spell

633
00:56:53,937 --> 00:56:59,398
and finally succeeded in
confining Kagutaba deep underground.

634
00:57:03,146 --> 00:57:07,344
"Shimokage Village submerged with the
construction of Shikami Dam in 1978"

635
00:57:07,484 --> 00:57:09,452
"The demon ritual was discontinued."

636
00:57:11,488 --> 00:57:13,388
This is Shikami town hall.

637
00:57:13,656 --> 00:57:17,717
I'm interested in the old rituals
performed

638
00:57:17,861 --> 00:57:20,694
at Shimokage village before it went
underwater.

639
00:57:21,998 --> 00:57:23,898
Okay... Hold on please.

640
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:28,936
So you want to know
about the Shimokage rituals?

641
00:57:29,072 --> 00:57:30,300
Yes, I do.

642
00:57:30,773 --> 00:57:33,742
We don't have it
very well documented so...

643
00:57:33,977 --> 00:57:36,673
I'll introduce you to someone.

644
00:57:36,913 --> 00:57:40,815
Mr. Tanimura
researches local history.

645
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:43,382
Hello, my name's Kobayashi.

646
00:57:44,988 --> 00:57:46,512
Oh, hello there.

647
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,882
Please come in.

648
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:53,293
The ritual was never
performed publicly.

649
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:55,522
So there's no documentation.

650
00:57:56,065 --> 00:58:00,764
But the last ritual
performed in 1978 was filmed

651
00:58:00,937 --> 00:58:06,705
by a film production contracted by
Mr. Ishii, the priest.

652
00:58:07,243 --> 00:58:09,473
These are the 16mm films.

653
00:58:10,747 --> 00:58:13,545
I pleaded with the Ishii family to
give them to me.

654
00:58:13,816 --> 00:58:21,154
This is the video.
I transferred the film to video.

655
00:58:31,701 --> 00:58:37,537
Shimokage village was a community
of sorcerers.

656
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,741
The villagers
still believe in sorcery.

657
00:58:43,012 --> 00:58:46,675
Now it's becoming a fading memory

658
00:58:46,983 --> 00:58:54,014
but they still place a sickle at
the door to keep away evil spirits.

659
00:58:54,157 --> 00:59:00,255
Those who left the village have
a sickle above their front doors.

660
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:02,096
Interesting.

661
00:59:02,231 --> 00:59:03,562
"We don't need a dam!"

662
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:11,033
Shimokage sorcerers used dogs
in their rituals.

663
00:59:11,307 --> 00:59:16,574
That's why the villagers
still have dogs.

664
00:59:19,816 --> 00:59:23,479
This is the Demon Shrine where
the ritual was performed.

665
00:59:25,121 --> 00:59:29,057
Mr. Ishii was a priest
at this shrine.

666
00:59:29,392 --> 00:59:31,587
You'll see him in a minute.

667
00:59:35,198 --> 00:59:39,066
Look. That's Kagutaba.

668
00:59:42,405 --> 00:59:46,239
This ritual is to pacify the demon.

669
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,363
Now Kagutaba is rampaging.

670
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:34,883
That's Ishii, the priest.

671
01:00:35,558 --> 01:00:39,756
He is going to pacify Kagutaba.

672
01:00:46,936 --> 01:00:49,837
Now the priest will bow...

673
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:59,241
One bow, four claps... and one bow.

674
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:04,613
This is a distinctive way to bow,
only done at this shrine.

675
01:01:06,022 --> 01:01:12,484
Usually it's two bows,
two claps and one bow.

676
01:01:13,963 --> 01:01:17,592
But this is one bow,
four claps, one bow.

677
01:01:17,734 --> 01:01:23,400
There is no other place in Japan
where people bow in this manner.

678
01:01:23,673 --> 01:01:27,769
But after the priest bowed...

679
01:01:27,944 --> 01:01:34,713
The woman who was playing the part
of Kagutaba became delirious.

680
01:01:34,951 --> 01:01:37,112
They had to stop the ritual.

681
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:31,829
The religious villagers said that
she was possessed.

682
01:02:32,809 --> 01:02:36,540
Some said that
owing to the dam plan...

683
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:41,706
the ritual wouldn't be performed
again, which angered Kagutaba.

684
01:02:41,951 --> 01:02:44,283
They thought it was
some kind of curse.

685
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:51,424
In the legend, Kagutaba was confined
underneath Shimokage village.

686
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:55,493
And it's the demon in the ritual.

687
01:02:55,898 --> 01:02:58,628
What was it really?

688
01:02:59,168 --> 01:03:02,797
Nobody knows for sure.

689
01:03:04,106 --> 01:03:09,203
I would like to meet
Mr. Ishii, the priest.

690
01:03:09,712 --> 01:03:11,202
Is that possible?

691
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:18,516
7 years ago, immediately after
giving me the film...

692
01:03:18,754 --> 01:03:21,018
Mr. Ishii died from an illness.

693
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:25,627
So did his wife but
their only daughter's still alive.

694
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:31,198
She was the possessed woman
in the film...

695
01:03:31,334 --> 01:03:34,497
She recently moved back here
from Tokyo.

696
01:03:34,637 --> 01:03:38,733
I heard that she lives with
her son in the Ishii house.

697
01:03:39,275 --> 01:03:42,267
She's in the Mikaishi community,

698
01:03:42,411 --> 01:03:44,504
where the Shimokage villagers
moved to.

699
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,147
Mikaishi?

700
01:03:46,616 --> 01:03:50,177
I also heard that
she's a bit eccentric.

701
01:03:51,053 --> 01:03:54,386
I don't know if she'll talk to you.

702
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:07,266
"Mikaishi Village"

703
01:04:07,403 --> 01:04:09,496
I think we're almost there.

704
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:33,226
What's this?

705
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:06,553
This has to have some connection.

706
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:12,432
Hello?

707
01:05:16,105 --> 01:05:17,572
Hello?

708
01:05:21,243 --> 01:05:23,143
Anybody home?

709
01:05:26,349 --> 01:05:28,943
How can you talk to me like that!?

710
01:05:29,318 --> 01:05:32,845
I'm asking you!
How can you talk to me like that?

711
01:05:43,566 --> 01:05:45,397
Did you see her?

712
01:05:46,002 --> 01:05:47,594
I did.

713
01:05:48,938 --> 01:05:55,104
A woman in her 40s and her boy,
aged between 6 and 9.

714
01:05:55,578 --> 01:05:58,741
How can you just
talk to me like that?

715
01:05:58,948 --> 01:06:02,111
So her name is Junko Ishii.

716
01:06:06,122 --> 01:06:10,650
Kobayashi asked around.

717
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:16,130
Look, the sickle.

718
01:06:17,233 --> 01:06:19,633
Hello, anybody home?

719
01:06:30,813 --> 01:06:33,646
Is anybody home?

720
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,217
Nobody.

721
01:06:39,188 --> 01:06:40,655
May I help you?

722
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:45,984
Excuse me but do you know
the Ishii house down the street?

723
01:06:46,695 --> 01:06:49,425
There seems to be
something strange...

724
01:06:49,698 --> 01:06:54,362
Yeah, ever since
the daughter came back.

725
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:56,931
You'd best stay away from her.

726
01:06:58,941 --> 01:07:00,238
For you own sake.

727
01:07:07,483 --> 01:07:08,677
Excuse me.

728
01:07:10,986 --> 01:07:12,112
What?

729
01:07:12,288 --> 01:07:13,380
Sorry to bother you.

730
01:07:13,522 --> 01:07:14,614
TV?

731
01:07:14,957 --> 01:07:19,053
You know Mrs. Ishii down the street.

732
01:07:19,361 --> 01:07:20,760
Ishii?

733
01:07:35,177 --> 01:07:40,809
I'm a journalist doing research.
You may be able to help me.

734
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:41,712
Could you help me?

735
01:07:41,851 --> 01:07:43,375
Come in.

736
01:07:43,786 --> 01:07:45,754
Oh, thank you so much.

737
01:07:46,856 --> 01:07:52,556
I was a good friend of Junko's
before she moved out.

738
01:07:52,862 --> 01:07:57,390
She left the village to go
to nursing school in Tokyo.

739
01:07:57,533 --> 01:08:01,469
Do you remember
the name of the school?

740
01:08:01,604 --> 01:08:09,306
Musashino Nurse School or something.
I don't remember clearly.

741
01:08:09,445 --> 01:08:14,542
How can I put this...
Has Junko always been...

742
01:08:14,683 --> 01:08:17,618
mentally disturbed like she is now?

743
01:08:17,753 --> 01:08:19,345
Not at all.

744
01:08:19,522 --> 01:08:22,389
She was just a friendly,
regular girl.

745
01:08:22,525 --> 01:08:23,321
Was she?

746
01:08:23,459 --> 01:08:26,951
She changed after the demon ritual.

747
01:08:27,096 --> 01:08:28,427
The demon ritual?

748
01:08:29,031 --> 01:08:31,295
She started to act strangely.

749
01:08:32,868 --> 01:08:37,567
I think the ritual caused her
to become possessed.

750
01:08:40,042 --> 01:08:45,810
She told me that she'd heard
god's voice.

751
01:08:46,415 --> 01:08:49,213
She said she had to obey his words.

752
01:08:50,486 --> 01:08:54,820
She became kind of strange
after that.

753
01:08:55,257 --> 01:09:00,957
I heard that people thought
it was the Kagutaba's curse.

754
01:09:01,697 --> 01:09:03,324
Do you think she was...

755
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:23,180
Excuse me?

756
01:09:28,157 --> 01:09:29,317
Hello?

757
01:09:35,831 --> 01:09:38,061
"January 21, Musashino, Tokyo"

758
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:44,662
May I ask a few questions about
Junko Ishii, one of your graduates?

759
01:09:44,807 --> 01:09:49,107
After she graduated in 1982

760
01:09:49,245 --> 01:09:53,978
she got a job at an obstetric clinic
in Hachioji.

761
01:09:54,116 --> 01:09:56,243
I can disclose the name of
the clinic

762
01:09:56,418 --> 01:10:00,286
but it closed in 2000.

763
01:10:03,626 --> 01:10:07,528
May I ask you some questions

764
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:10,460
regarding somebody
you used to work with?

765
01:10:10,599 --> 01:10:12,089
Sure.

766
01:10:12,668 --> 01:10:16,195
Junko Ishii.
What kind of a person was she?

767
01:10:16,939 --> 01:10:21,899
She was a very hardworking woman.

768
01:10:22,111 --> 01:10:25,103
Quiet in a spooky sort of way.

769
01:10:25,381 --> 01:10:30,409
She was the kind of woman
who only talks about work.

770
01:10:31,253 --> 01:10:34,484
The clinic we used to work for...

771
01:10:34,623 --> 01:10:39,993
performed abortions even into
the 22nd week of pregnancies.

772
01:10:41,263 --> 01:10:43,788
It's clearly illegal.

773
01:10:44,033 --> 01:10:50,268
And she was the one in charge of
disposing of the aborted embryos.

774
01:10:50,406 --> 01:10:54,809
There was a rumor that
she took the embryos home.

775
01:10:57,146 --> 01:10:59,671
"Did she really take the embryos?"

776
01:10:59,815 --> 01:11:02,113
"If she did, for what purpose?"

777
01:11:05,354 --> 01:11:08,448
"February 6"

778
01:11:11,293 --> 01:11:16,595
Midori? Is she your colleague...

779
01:11:16,732 --> 01:11:19,200
the one who lives directly upstairs?

780
01:11:22,838 --> 01:11:24,635
Yes. Midori has...

781
01:11:33,482 --> 01:11:35,279
She's dead.

782
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:44,655
The police came and told me that...

783
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:58,902
Midori... committed suicide.

784
01:12:00,809 --> 01:12:03,175
She did it in the park.

785
01:12:05,214 --> 01:12:09,048
She killed herself with...

786
01:12:10,386 --> 01:12:13,617
a bunch of strangers.

787
01:12:16,592 --> 01:12:18,617
They hanged themselves...

788
01:12:22,097 --> 01:12:25,260
Do you think it was my fault?

789
01:12:30,172 --> 01:12:34,632
I got so scared that
I left the apartment.

790
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:43,147
I'm sorry...

791
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:45,954
I'm sorry...

792
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:54,320
Kobayashi asked his wife to
take care of Marika.

793
01:13:01,069 --> 01:13:02,832
I'm home.

794
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:06,471
Hi.

795
01:13:06,809 --> 01:13:07,639
Keiko, my wife.

796
01:13:07,776 --> 01:13:09,073
Nice to meet you.

797
01:13:09,611 --> 01:13:13,012
It's nice of you to let me stay.

798
01:13:15,684 --> 01:13:19,518
"News footage aired the same night"

799
01:13:19,688 --> 01:13:24,455
6 am today in Hironuma Park
in Nerima, Tokyo...

800
01:13:24,693 --> 01:13:29,562
7 men and women were found dead.

801
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:32,599
They were hanging
from the iron bar of the swing.

802
01:13:33,602 --> 01:13:39,336
It's suspected that the strangers
got together to commit suicide.

803
01:13:42,678 --> 01:13:46,774
"7 bodies hanging from the swing."

804
01:13:53,088 --> 01:13:58,617
Here are the names of those
who hanged themselves.

805
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,853
"February 10"

806
01:14:01,763 --> 01:14:03,094
Look.

807
01:14:04,766 --> 01:14:09,226
This is the girl who lived
upstairs from Marika.

808
01:14:15,043 --> 01:14:16,943
And look at him.

809
01:14:27,789 --> 01:14:32,385
When he first moved in
he was just a pleasant, normal guy.

810
01:14:32,728 --> 01:14:36,630
But about half a year ago...
It was around last summer...

811
01:14:36,798 --> 01:14:42,327
He started to complain a lot to
the woman who was living next door.

812
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:44,162
They argued a lot.

813
01:14:44,306 --> 01:14:45,364
Is that right?

814
01:14:45,507 --> 01:14:50,467
His neighbor was a tough
middle-aged woman.

815
01:14:51,246 --> 01:14:56,548
But eventually she moved out.
I guess she felt scared.

816
01:14:56,818 --> 01:14:59,309
The neighbor moved out?

817
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:08,158
Do you remember what kind of
arguments they used to have?

818
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:14,500
He complained about the baby
being too noisy.

819
01:15:14,636 --> 01:15:15,830
A baby?

820
01:15:15,971 --> 01:15:18,064
She didn't have a baby, though.

821
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:24,506
It was just her and her boy
who was 5 or 6.

822
01:15:25,614 --> 01:15:27,878
Just a moment, please...

823
01:15:29,718 --> 01:15:34,746
Is the woman
who used to live there...

824
01:15:36,124 --> 01:15:38,888
Is this the woman?

825
01:15:39,227 --> 01:15:41,320
Yes, that's her.

826
01:15:41,997 --> 01:15:43,897
No mistake. It's her.

827
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:52,838
"News footage, February 12"

828
01:15:54,076 --> 01:15:55,407
Next news.

829
01:15:55,744 --> 01:15:58,372
Earlier today at an apartment
in Fuchu

830
01:15:58,614 --> 01:16:03,278
a businessman stabbed his wife
to death and got arrested.

831
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:06,415
Our reporter is at the murder site.

832
01:16:07,389 --> 01:16:09,289
Today at 7:10 am

833
01:16:09,524 --> 01:16:14,723
a man called the police
and said that he'd stabbed his wife.

834
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:17,225
The police rushed
to the apartment

835
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:21,631
and found Kimiko Yano
stabbed to death.

836
01:16:22,204 --> 01:16:27,141
Also at the site was the suspect,
Teruyuki Yano, her husband.

837
01:16:27,275 --> 01:16:30,574
He confessed and was arrested
on the spot.

838
01:16:30,812 --> 01:16:36,478
So far he has not told the police
why he killed his wife.

839
01:16:36,885 --> 01:16:41,948
Their daughter has been missing
for a few months.

840
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:45,355
Do the police know anything
about her disappearance?

841
01:16:46,328 --> 01:16:48,922
They have no information on her.

842
01:16:49,164 --> 01:16:54,227
Kana, the daughter disappeared
on December 19 last year.

843
01:16:54,503 --> 01:16:56,232
No clues have been found.

844
01:16:59,641 --> 01:17:05,375
Today, Marika's cooking for me.

845
01:17:05,514 --> 01:17:06,913
It's something yummy.

846
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:12,052
It's Spaghetti al Bongole
with tomato sauce.

847
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:17,553
Here, my special pasta
and potato salad.

848
01:17:18,527 --> 01:17:19,858
They look great.

849
01:17:20,028 --> 01:17:24,328
And this is... my special tea.

850
01:17:24,466 --> 01:17:26,331
Isn't it out of a can?

851
01:17:26,468 --> 01:17:28,993
No. It's my special oolong tea.

852
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:33,200
Would you like some Tabasco?

853
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:35,508
Yes? Here it comes.

854
01:17:37,312 --> 01:17:40,941
A gourmet lunch.

855
01:17:45,987 --> 01:17:47,352
Marika?

856
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Marika!

857
01:18:02,704 --> 01:18:05,673
Marika, what's wrong?

858
01:18:09,444 --> 01:18:10,911
Did I groan?

859
01:18:11,046 --> 01:18:12,411
Yes.

860
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:20,952
You seemed to be suffering,
you groaned and...

861
01:18:23,859 --> 01:18:31,095
And some things crashed into
the window at the same time.

862
01:18:50,852 --> 01:18:52,319
What is it?

863
01:18:52,487 --> 01:18:54,751
Are you okay?

864
01:19:31,526 --> 01:19:33,551
I'm...

865
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:37,060
I'm the next one to die.

866
01:19:47,676 --> 01:19:50,907
I'm going to Nagano again.

867
01:19:51,613 --> 01:19:54,081
I'll talk to Junko Ishii...

868
01:19:54,683 --> 01:20:00,485
and get her to talk to us.

869
01:20:02,891 --> 01:20:08,796
That will help us
solve this mystery.

870
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:21,107
Hori, the psychic said
to watch out for pigeons.

871
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:29,746
Did he mean that pigeons were
a sign of imminent death?

872
01:20:37,225 --> 01:20:44,529
Let's visit him tomorrow
and ask him about it.

873
01:20:53,675 --> 01:20:55,233
"We visited Mr. Hori"

874
01:20:55,377 --> 01:20:57,902
"to show him the Junko Ishii tape."

875
01:21:00,115 --> 01:21:04,051
"February 13"

876
01:21:10,525 --> 01:21:11,719
Mr. Hori.

877
01:21:13,061 --> 01:21:15,996
Are you ready, Mr. Hori?

878
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,563
This is what we want you to watch.

879
01:21:23,238 --> 01:21:24,967
It's on this tape.

880
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

881
01:21:48,697 --> 01:21:50,164
I'm sorry.

882
01:21:51,499 --> 01:21:53,091
I've turned it off.

883
01:21:59,341 --> 01:22:02,310
Mr. Hori.

884
01:22:03,178 --> 01:22:07,080
When you watched the video,
did you feel something

885
01:22:07,248 --> 01:22:09,239
or did you see anything?

886
01:22:11,486 --> 01:22:13,579
Mr. Hori.

887
01:22:23,365 --> 01:22:24,764
Mr. Kobayashi.

888
01:22:28,103 --> 01:22:30,401
Take me to the dam...

889
01:22:31,106 --> 01:22:34,837
where the village was,
the one with the demon rituals.

890
01:22:37,012 --> 01:22:39,412
Why do you want to go there?

891
01:22:39,547 --> 01:22:44,484
I want to try to perform
the ritual myself...

892
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,782
and see what it does to me.

893
01:22:47,956 --> 01:22:49,617
Absolutely not!

894
01:22:49,758 --> 01:22:56,220
The ritual might have caused
Junko Ishii's possession.

895
01:22:56,698 --> 01:22:58,996
It's too dangerous.

896
01:22:59,901 --> 01:23:04,235
If the ritual is necessary,
I'll go and do it by myself.

897
01:23:04,472 --> 01:23:06,599
I don't want to die...

898
01:23:10,078 --> 01:23:12,603
I have to do it myself.

899
01:23:26,027 --> 01:23:27,551
Please.

900
01:23:33,001 --> 01:23:38,769
Okay then. Let's go to the dam.

901
01:23:39,174 --> 01:23:41,836
I'll visit Mr. Hori again

902
01:23:42,177 --> 01:23:44,111
and ask him to come along with us.

903
01:23:46,448 --> 01:23:49,144
Mr. Hori! We need your help!

904
01:23:49,451 --> 01:23:52,113
What can we do to contain
the Kagutaba curse?

905
01:23:54,255 --> 01:23:55,552
Mr. Hori.

906
01:23:58,593 --> 01:24:02,051
We can't do this without your help.

907
01:24:04,632 --> 01:24:07,226
Kana...

908
01:24:07,869 --> 01:24:10,269
The worms have eaten her...

909
01:24:10,472 --> 01:24:14,408
Maybe these worms are
actually Kagutaba.

910
01:24:34,095 --> 01:24:36,928
It's too quiet around here...

911
01:24:43,872 --> 01:24:47,205
Where are the dogs now?

912
01:24:52,347 --> 01:24:56,249
"We drove to the dam
where Shimokage village used to be."

913
01:25:31,753 --> 01:25:34,654
"Shikami Dam"

914
01:25:37,058 --> 01:25:38,025
Are you okay?

915
01:25:53,942 --> 01:25:58,379
This is where we are on the map.

916
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,680
So the shrine must have been...

917
01:26:02,517 --> 01:26:08,251
right between that point
and the shore.

918
01:26:15,663 --> 01:26:16,994
Off we go.

919
01:26:17,799 --> 01:26:20,199
Let me know when you get back.

920
01:26:20,735 --> 01:26:22,430
Thank you so much.

921
01:26:24,973 --> 01:26:28,272
We'll be back soon.

922
01:26:35,917 --> 01:26:37,578
Are you okay, Marika?

923
01:26:39,153 --> 01:26:42,816
You don't look good.
We should go back.

924
01:26:42,991 --> 01:26:45,459
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

925
01:26:47,795 --> 01:26:49,228
We're almost there.

926
01:27:03,511 --> 01:27:04,671
It's about here.

927
01:27:05,947 --> 01:27:08,780
Let's get ready.

928
01:27:46,487 --> 01:27:47,784
Good.

929
01:27:49,057 --> 01:27:54,324
Now, you bow in that special way.

930
01:27:55,663 --> 01:28:02,398
One bow, four claps, one bow...

931
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:43,304
How do you feel?

932
01:28:56,224 --> 01:28:57,452
Talk to me.

933
01:29:02,363 --> 01:29:04,024
I'm better.

934
01:29:04,732 --> 01:29:05,699
Are you?

935
01:29:06,167 --> 01:29:08,158
I feel lighter.

936
01:29:08,503 --> 01:29:13,964
Good! It worked for you.

937
01:29:14,375 --> 01:29:17,139
It was good we came to do this!

938
01:29:17,278 --> 01:29:19,109
It's gone...

939
01:29:23,151 --> 01:29:28,248
What's wrong, Mr. Hori?

940
01:29:28,423 --> 01:29:29,913
It's not good...

941
01:29:30,057 --> 01:29:31,251
What's not good?

942
01:29:31,726 --> 01:29:33,751
It's not good at all...

943
01:29:34,095 --> 01:29:37,030
I feel so much clearer now.

944
01:29:37,665 --> 01:29:39,599
Thank you so much.

945
01:29:48,409 --> 01:29:49,740
Hurry back!

946
01:29:51,078 --> 01:29:53,376
Oh, no, no, no!

947
01:29:53,714 --> 01:29:55,045
Hurry!

948
01:29:55,349 --> 01:29:59,547
Get out of there!

949
01:29:59,921 --> 01:30:02,014
They'll eat you up!

950
01:30:02,590 --> 01:30:04,023
Now!

951
01:30:04,158 --> 01:30:05,523
Hurry!

952
01:30:06,627 --> 01:30:09,994
We have to leave the mountain!

953
01:30:10,331 --> 01:30:11,491
Drive away!

954
01:30:11,632 --> 01:30:14,066
Let's get out of here, then.

955
01:30:14,202 --> 01:30:16,170
Back to the car.

956
01:30:18,005 --> 01:30:19,165
Mr. Hori.

957
01:30:21,309 --> 01:30:22,435
Kana!

958
01:30:26,747 --> 01:30:28,715
Wait a minute, Mr. Hori!

959
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:30,579
Take care of Marika.

960
01:30:30,852 --> 01:30:31,841
No problem.

961
01:30:36,357 --> 01:30:38,348
Mr. Kobayashi, wait!

962
01:30:38,626 --> 01:30:41,151
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

963
01:30:41,762 --> 01:30:43,593
He's okay. Let's go.

964
01:30:43,764 --> 01:30:44,731
Are you sure?

965
01:30:45,066 --> 01:30:46,158
To the car.

966
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:50,730
Wait a minute!

967
01:31:01,082 --> 01:31:04,813
Are they going to be okay?

968
01:31:05,019 --> 01:31:06,486
I'll go look for them later.

969
01:31:07,221 --> 01:31:08,882
How do you feel now?

970
01:31:09,323 --> 01:31:13,123
Me? I'm feeling just fine.

971
01:31:13,794 --> 01:31:14,886
Let's go then.

972
01:31:18,399 --> 01:31:19,423
Mr. Hori!

973
01:31:20,735 --> 01:31:21,997
Kana!

974
01:31:25,673 --> 01:31:27,834
Mr. Hori, you have to stop!

975
01:31:28,442 --> 01:31:30,000
Kana!

976
01:31:45,393 --> 01:31:49,659
Wait a minute!

977
01:32:13,154 --> 01:32:13,916
Marika?

978
01:32:18,826 --> 01:32:21,795
Wait for me, Mr. Hori!

979
01:32:23,064 --> 01:32:24,224
What is it?

980
01:32:25,967 --> 01:32:28,367
What's wrong?

981
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:31,937
Dogs?

982
01:32:35,176 --> 01:32:37,007
They've just been killed...

983
01:32:37,244 --> 01:32:38,768
Are they the village dogs?

984
01:32:42,683 --> 01:32:46,346
What's happening now?

985
01:32:48,923 --> 01:32:51,858
What's this?

986
01:32:55,663 --> 01:33:00,532
It's a magic field...

987
01:33:05,006 --> 01:33:09,466
What's going on here?

988
01:33:15,516 --> 01:33:18,417
More dead dogs...

989
01:33:18,686 --> 01:33:22,850
Don't go in there!

990
01:33:23,524 --> 01:33:26,550
Stay away!

991
01:33:28,095 --> 01:33:29,221
Marika!

992
01:33:31,666 --> 01:33:34,191
Are you okay, Marika?

993
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:39,706
Marika, what's wrong?

994
01:33:43,244 --> 01:33:45,644
Should I pull over? Are you okay?

995
01:33:58,259 --> 01:34:00,284
What's wrong? Are you okay?

996
01:34:11,038 --> 01:34:12,198
Marika!

997
01:34:17,278 --> 01:34:18,711
Marika!

998
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:30,016
What's going on, Mr. Hori?

999
01:34:30,424 --> 01:34:32,824
What did you find there?

1000
01:34:37,298 --> 01:34:38,390
Marika!

1001
01:34:40,835 --> 01:34:42,029
Marika!

1002
01:34:49,844 --> 01:34:55,749
Marika, can you hear me?

1003
01:34:57,451 --> 01:34:59,942
Can you hear me?

1004
01:35:00,087 --> 01:35:04,615
Marika!

1005
01:35:20,374 --> 01:35:22,103
It's a shrine!

1006
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:26,769
Kana... Kana...

1007
01:35:27,515 --> 01:35:28,777
Mr. Hori!

1008
01:35:44,698 --> 01:35:48,657
Mr. Hori, is Kana in there?

1009
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:50,464
Marika.

1010
01:35:59,013 --> 01:35:59,980
Marika!

1011
01:36:07,721 --> 01:36:11,452
Marika!

1012
01:36:14,495 --> 01:36:16,429
Marika!

1013
01:36:18,499 --> 01:36:19,932
Kana.

1014
01:36:20,267 --> 01:36:23,236
Is she in there?

1015
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:31,178
This is ancient.

1016
01:36:33,514 --> 01:36:34,606
My God!

1017
01:36:35,115 --> 01:36:38,414
This pattern is the same as
what Kana drew...

1018
01:36:41,622 --> 01:36:42,919
What's wrong, Mr. Hori?

1019
01:37:12,286 --> 01:37:16,120
Mr. Hori, are you okay?

1020
01:37:16,924 --> 01:37:18,391
Mr. Hori!

1021
01:37:21,262 --> 01:37:23,787
Get a grip of yourself!

1022
01:37:24,064 --> 01:37:25,497
Marika!

1023
01:37:27,401 --> 01:37:32,100
Come back!

1024
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:40,212
Can you hear me?

1025
01:37:41,415 --> 01:37:42,643
Yes...

1026
01:37:45,486 --> 01:37:46,851
Are you okay?

1027
01:37:47,488 --> 01:37:49,217
Yes...

1028
01:37:50,124 --> 01:37:52,217
What is this?

1029
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:03,564
"We took Marika and Mr. Hori
to a local hospital."

1030
01:38:06,473 --> 01:38:11,308
"And we went back to Junko Ishii's
house in search of truth."

1031
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:17,510
Excuse me!

1032
01:38:56,523 --> 01:38:57,717
Let's go in.

1033
01:39:13,407 --> 01:39:14,999
Let's go and see.

1034
01:39:51,545 --> 01:39:54,173
Film here.

1035
01:40:02,956 --> 01:40:04,048
Let's go upstairs.

1036
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1037
01:40:51,338 --> 01:40:52,862
It's Junko Ishii.

1038
01:40:54,575 --> 01:40:58,602
It's her. She's hung herself.

1039
01:41:02,516 --> 01:41:04,040
Look at that!

1040
01:41:05,586 --> 01:41:07,417
Kagutaba masks.

1041
01:41:12,526 --> 01:41:15,120
She's hung pigeons up here...

1042
01:41:21,268 --> 01:41:23,998
There is a boy behind there!

1043
01:41:24,138 --> 01:41:25,799
A boy?

1044
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:28,373
Behind there!

1045
01:41:32,913 --> 01:41:34,244
Kana!

1046
01:41:35,015 --> 01:41:37,882
It's Kana! It's her!

1047
01:41:40,587 --> 01:41:44,250
Kana!

1048
01:41:50,731 --> 01:41:52,699
She's cold...

1049
01:41:54,568 --> 01:41:56,297
Are you okay?

1050
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:58,795
Are you hurt?

1051
01:42:06,613 --> 01:42:07,875
Miyajima.

1052
01:42:09,349 --> 01:42:12,284
We have to call the police now.

1053
01:42:49,323 --> 01:42:53,259
"Missing girl found dead
in Nagano."

1054
01:42:54,528 --> 01:42:56,860
"The boy presumed to be Ishii's son"

1055
01:42:56,997 --> 01:42:59,864
"isn't actually her child."

1056
01:43:00,567 --> 01:43:04,059
Kobayashi decided to adopt the boy.

1057
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:11,375
"March 6"

1058
01:43:13,914 --> 01:43:15,142
Is it good?

1059
01:43:19,052 --> 01:43:20,644
Yummy?

1060
01:43:22,422 --> 01:43:24,652
It's a good omelet, isn't it?

1061
01:43:32,899 --> 01:43:37,768
Do you remember anything about
living with that woman?

1062
01:43:59,259 --> 01:44:03,093
Marika, you look very good now.

1063
01:44:03,697 --> 01:44:09,465
Yes. I've been recovering nicely.

1064
01:44:10,771 --> 01:44:13,797
All those supernatural things...

1065
01:44:14,074 --> 01:44:18,101
have stopped happening.

1066
01:44:18,278 --> 01:44:20,109
Everything's normal now.

1067
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:21,677
Have you gone back to work?

1068
01:44:22,215 --> 01:44:27,847
Yes. I'm going back to work soon.

1069
01:44:28,922 --> 01:44:30,583
You have to eat it.

1070
01:44:30,724 --> 01:44:32,589
Okay, let's eat everybody.

1071
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:35,094
Let's eat.

1072
01:44:35,896 --> 01:44:36,794
Yummy.

1073
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:37,792
Are you sure?

1074
01:44:37,931 --> 01:44:39,330
Don't hit me! Ouch...

1075
01:44:48,008 --> 01:44:51,637
"March 13"

1076
01:44:54,514 --> 01:44:57,847
"Hori has been committed
to an institution."

1077
01:44:58,352 --> 01:45:01,685
"No visitors are allowed."

1078
01:45:05,058 --> 01:45:06,650
"March 17"

1079
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:11,092
I looked around for other things
connected to Kagutaba

1080
01:45:11,732 --> 01:45:14,030
after you left.

1081
01:45:14,301 --> 01:45:19,762
And I found this in
my grandfather's collection.

1082
01:45:20,574 --> 01:45:21,905
Here.

1083
01:45:31,952 --> 01:45:35,888
It says, "Shimokage's Way,
The Kagutaba method."

1084
01:45:36,022 --> 01:45:37,284
Oh, that's right.

1085
01:45:38,191 --> 01:45:40,182
I guess this scroll depicts

1086
01:45:40,394 --> 01:45:44,854
the ritual performed
to summon Kagutaba.

1087
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:48,361
These are the monkeys.

1088
01:45:48,769 --> 01:45:52,136
And the dogs.

1089
01:45:53,073 --> 01:45:57,100
They sacrificed the baby monkeys

1090
01:46:01,515 --> 01:46:05,474
and offered them
to the medium to eat.

1091
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:17,219
Just like the ancient spell of
the Shimokage sorcery...

1092
01:46:17,697 --> 01:46:22,157
which used baby monkeys
as sacrifices.

1093
01:46:22,402 --> 01:46:27,533
Junko Ishii used
Kana Yano as a medium.

1094
01:46:28,508 --> 01:46:32,308
She fed Kana the aborted babies...

1095
01:46:32,712 --> 01:46:38,173
in an attempt to resurrect Kagutaba.

1096
01:46:39,019 --> 01:46:44,616
It's only my speculation.

1097
01:46:45,425 --> 01:46:49,452
Now that Junko Ishii's dead

1098
01:46:50,163 --> 01:46:53,257
we'll never know the truth.

1099
01:46:54,801 --> 01:47:01,604
I only hope that the Kagutaba curse
has been contained.

1100
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I guess it's too late
for all of us.

1101
01:47:22,696 --> 01:47:25,995
"Camera operator, Hisashi Miyajima"

1102
01:47:27,601 --> 01:47:32,061
"Produced by Masafumi Kobayashi"

1103
01:47:40,447 --> 01:47:43,473
2 days after "NOROI, The Curse"
was completed...

1104
01:47:54,995 --> 01:47:57,657
The Kobayashi house burned down.

1105
01:47:59,566 --> 01:48:03,866
Later his wife, Keiko was found dead
in the remains.

1106
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:09,803
But Kobayashi wasn't found.
He was declared missing.

1107
01:48:13,146 --> 01:48:14,977
3 days after the fire...

1108
01:48:15,448 --> 01:48:20,408
Mitsuo Hori, who had escaped from
the institution

1109
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,620
was found dead.

1110
01:48:22,756 --> 01:48:24,724
"Picture of the Dead Man."

1111
01:48:25,892 --> 01:48:28,383
"Mystery of the man
who died in the duct!"

1112
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:42,731
May 19, 2004, a month later

1113
01:48:43,710 --> 01:48:47,612
a package was delivered to
Sugishobou Publishing.

1114
01:48:48,248 --> 01:48:50,512
There was no return address.

1115
01:48:51,484 --> 01:48:55,648
The sender's name was
Masafumi Kobayashi.

1116
01:48:58,758 --> 01:49:02,023
There was a video camera inside.

1117
01:49:04,864 --> 01:49:06,889
And inside the camera...

1118
01:49:08,268 --> 01:49:10,736
a video cassette was intact.

1119
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:32,815
What's going on, Mr. Hori?

1120
01:49:34,227 --> 01:49:35,990
Are you okay?

1121
01:49:38,865 --> 01:49:39,832
Mr. Hori?

1122
01:49:40,066 --> 01:49:42,466
You...

1123
01:49:43,703 --> 01:49:47,469
You've been eaten...

1124
01:49:47,774 --> 01:49:50,265
by the worms!

1125
01:49:50,744 --> 01:49:52,302
Are you?

1126
01:49:52,445 --> 01:49:54,037
Excuse me?

1127
01:49:54,381 --> 01:49:58,613
Why don't you put that rock down?

1128
01:50:00,286 --> 01:50:05,417
I can hear Kana...
Her voice comes in my head...

1129
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:12,156
- In my head... lt says...
- What is it?

1130
01:50:13,133 --> 01:50:14,896
Kagutaba's alive...

1131
01:50:15,568 --> 01:50:16,865
It lives!

1132
01:50:17,003 --> 01:50:18,664
What did you say?

1133
01:50:19,773 --> 01:50:22,241
Kagutaba lives!

1134
01:50:22,375 --> 01:50:25,833
But Junko Ishii's dead now.

1135
01:50:26,012 --> 01:50:28,480
Kagutaba has gone now.

1136
01:50:28,782 --> 01:50:31,945
You'd better go back
to the institution.

1137
01:50:32,085 --> 01:50:33,916
You should go back.

1138
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:35,844
Should I call the police?

1139
01:50:36,022 --> 01:50:38,217
No... Stop!

1140
01:50:40,326 --> 01:50:41,554
What are you doing?

1141
01:50:45,131 --> 01:50:47,429
Stop! What you're doing!

1142
01:50:52,739 --> 01:50:55,708
Stop it!

1143
01:50:56,543 --> 01:50:58,238
There he is!

1144
01:50:59,112 --> 01:51:00,943
What do you want?

1145
01:51:09,022 --> 01:51:11,547
It's him!

1146
01:51:12,258 --> 01:51:13,782
He killed Kana...

1147
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:15,552
Wait, just a minute.

1148
01:51:15,762 --> 01:51:17,593
The boy's a victim, too.

1149
01:51:19,632 --> 01:51:22,294
Kana!

1150
01:51:22,469 --> 01:51:24,664
Hold on a second!

1151
01:51:24,971 --> 01:51:28,566
Calm down.

1152
01:51:29,909 --> 01:51:31,604
You have to listen to me.

1153
01:51:33,279 --> 01:51:35,110
Just wait a minute.

1154
01:51:37,217 --> 01:51:41,381
I'll help you with
whatever you need.

1155
01:51:42,856 --> 01:51:48,419
Let go off the boy, okay?

1156
01:51:48,561 --> 01:51:50,188
No!

1157
01:51:51,364 --> 01:51:56,267
Stop it!

1158
01:52:02,375 --> 01:52:05,037
Are you okay?

1159
01:52:13,987 --> 01:52:16,512
Kana!

1160
01:52:24,564 --> 01:52:27,658
Keiko!

1161
01:52:30,136 --> 01:52:31,967
Mr. Hori!

1162
01:52:40,346 --> 01:52:43,747
Hori?

1163
01:52:47,353 --> 01:52:49,947
Mr. Hori...

1164
01:53:23,289 --> 01:53:24,620
Keiko?

1165
01:53:31,364 --> 01:53:32,456
Keiko!

1166
01:53:59,525 --> 01:54:00,958
Keiko!

1167
01:54:04,797 --> 01:54:08,255
Keiko!

1168
01:54:13,506 --> 01:54:17,636
Keiko!

1169
01:54:20,213 --> 01:54:27,210
Keiko!

1170
01:54:31,157 --> 01:54:36,720
"Masafumi Kobayashi is
still missing today."
