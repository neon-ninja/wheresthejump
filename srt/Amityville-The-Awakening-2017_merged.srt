00:00:52,028 --> 00:00:55,994
<i>We have six men that
were found last night,</i>

3
00:00:56,116 --> 00:00:59,665
<i>in bed... shot and killed.</i>

4
00:00:59,702 --> 00:01:04,083
<i>In 1965, Ronald DeFeo moved
his family from Brooklyn</i>

5
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:08,162
<i>into a beautiful three-storey home
in Amityville, Long Island.</i>

6
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:10,796
<i>Envisioning a better
life for themselves,</i>

7
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:14,730
<i>they even put a sign in front of
the house saying: "High Hopes".</i>

8
00:01:15,011 --> 00:01:18,391
<i>Then things went terribly wrong.</i>

9
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:28,475
<i>Rumors have been circulating</i>

10
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:31,938
<i>that there is something dark
and evil about the house.</i>

11
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:34,186
<i>That the house somehow drove Ronny DeFeo</i>

12
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:36,489
<i>to commit this grisly act.</i>

We're home!

29
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:57,582
Larry, old sicky bastard.

30
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:00,081
How did you even get in here?

31
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:17,742
Juliet?

32
00:04:21,406 --> 00:04:23,048
Are you up here?

33
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:29,249
Hello?

34
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:30,083
Joan!

35
00:05:30,235 --> 00:05:31,248
Hey!

36
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,726
Hi, you guys made it!
How was the ride?

37
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,129
We're worn out.
You know what? We're doing good.

38
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:37,306
I need to go back in town.

39
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:39,109
Thank you so much for
helping with all of...

40
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:40,667
What are sisters for?

41
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:57,891
Have you told them... about...?

42
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,623
No?

43
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:04,008
Oh, I just want us
to get settled in first, OK?

44
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:07,135
OK. Well, I have everything set up the way
you wanted if you wanna check it out.

45
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:10,795
I set up an emergency back-up
battery just in case.

46
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:12,967
You never know with these old houses.

47
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:14,643
And...

48
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:16,966
You know we're only
five minutes on the road,

49
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:18,867
so you say the word
if you need anything.

50
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:21,135
- We'll be there.
- Thank you.

51
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:23,968
We've pretty much
gotten to a routine now, so...

52
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,692
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

53
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:27,704
Everything's gonna be fine.

54
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:29,744
What did doctor Milton say?

55
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:32,227
The same as usual,
you know...

56
00:06:32,252 --> 00:06:34,477
We're not gonna give up fighting.

57
00:06:35,157 --> 00:06:36,755
Of course.

58
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:41,535
All right, everybody!
Dig in!

59
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:44,031
Aren't we gonna say grace?

60
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:45,867
You hate saying grace.

61
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:47,878
Never stopped you before.

62
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:51,883
Well, maybe I'm embracing a change.

63
00:06:52,743 --> 00:06:54,133
I'll do it!

64
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:58,189
"Dear Lord, thank you for this food".

65
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:00,905
"And for this house".

66
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:04,678
"And for keeping James safe and happy".

67
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,759
"Amen".

68
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:09,246
Juls, how do you like your room?

69
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:12,780
Awesome! It's got pink,
purple, silver and gold.

70
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:14,868
All my favourite colors.

71
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:16,882
Do you have all your
paperwork done for tomorrow?

72
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:18,126
Yup.

73
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:19,887
Things do look good.

74
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:22,390
Yeah, it looks great.

75
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:25,469
Besides the fact that I have to
move to a completely new school

76
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:27,785
and start all over again
on my senior year...

77
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:30,527
We all have to make sacrifices.

78
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:31,736
Quiet, boy!

79
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:34,520
And what part of sacrifice
does this house fit into?

80
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,626
It's - It's three times
as big as our last one.

81
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:39,448
I told you.
We got a deal.

82
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:41,770
Save a few bucks?
That's good to know.

83
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,814
We moved here to be close
to my family, to Candice.

84
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,480
St. Alcuin has the best neurological
department in New York.

85
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:51,197
I want you to trust me, all right?

86
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:53,535
This house is gonna be good for James.

87
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:55,146
And that's all that matters.

88
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:57,571
Right now, yes,
that's all that matters.

89
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:00,694
We all need to rally round and that's
the only way he's gonna get through this.

90
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:02,514
Get through what, Mom?

91
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:05,867
I know James, OK?
I know him better than you do.

92
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:08,093
He's my twin!
I can feel it!

93
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:09,828
He's not there!

94
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:13,036
- And whose fault is that?
- James is gone, Mom!

95
00:08:13,143 --> 00:08:14,766
That's enough!

96
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,944
Belle?

97
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:18,370
Larry, come on!

98
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,224
Yeah.

99
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:41,222
You still love me, don't you, Larry?

100
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:44,661
Even if you are stuck
with that dumb name.

101
00:08:48,216 --> 00:08:49,630
Come on.

102
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:28,552
I miss talking to you.

103
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,372
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:01,563
I'm so sorry.

105
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:40,327
Let's go, people!

106
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:45,861
OK, guys, this is Belle.
She just transferred here.

107
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:48,352
Have a seat and take notes.

108
00:10:49,263 --> 00:10:53,998
We left off yesterday page 38.
1862. The Civil War.

109
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:57,270
Battlefield medicine.
Clara Barton.

110
00:10:57,286 --> 00:10:59,871
Check out the lipstick on freaky girl.

111
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:02,327
She ended up starting
the American Red Cross.

112
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:05,175
What she did was, she talked
mothers and daughters

113
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:08,875
to come out to the battlefield
and take care of their sons... brothers.

114
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,524
It's not you.

115
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:13,498
It's the house.

116
00:11:13,994 --> 00:11:15,301
What house?

117
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:17,883
Yeah, 112 Ocean Avenue.

118
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,262
Ugh! Who are you?
Some kind of stalker?

119
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:23,795
What? No!

120
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,469
How do you know
where I live?

121
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:26,673
- Everyone knows where you...
- Please, just...

122
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:28,181
Hey, hey, hey!

123
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:31,648
It's your first day.

Juliet, you can't just...

130
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:10,039
... sneak up on people like that.

131
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:11,636
Sorry.

132
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:35,605
What are you doing up?

133
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:38,173
I just wanted to talk to James.

134
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:41,116
Doesn't James talk to you, Belle?

135
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:44,023
In a way, I guess.

136
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,566
Does he use bad words?

137
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,233
Why would you say that?

138
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,194
OK, party animal.
It's sleepy-time. Come here.

139

- Yes?

How come Mommy
doesn't love you anymore?

142
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:14,325
Who told you that?

143
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:26,173
Go to bed.

144
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:29,129
Go back to bed, girls.

145

let's go back to bed.

146

James?

147
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,255
It's his heart.

148
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:47,341
Sweetheart, stay with us, OK?

149
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:49,953
Belle is here,
Mom is here...

150
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:54,275
Good.

151
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:56,407
All right, sweetheart.

152
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:59,695
You're doing great.

153
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,058
Who's my brave boy?

154
00:16:07,786 --> 00:16:09,628
It's gonna be OK.

155
00:16:10,457 --> 00:16:14,043
All right baby.
Now, OK, sweetie.

Baby?

157
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,048
I don't understand.

Come on!

don't do this.

- Come on!
- Mom.

170
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:02,134
- It's over.
- That's what you want, isn't it?

171

It's what God would want.

Honey.

We're never gonna stop fighting for you.

I mean, it has to be!

I know it may seem that way.

220
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:42,219

there was no brain activity at all.

OK, then, where's the fuse box?

352
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:19,932
I think it's under the stairs.

353
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:36,964
Oh, great. The basement of the
Amityville house, that's perfect.

354
00:32:37,073 --> 00:32:39,143
Haven't been down there yet.

355
00:32:39,671 --> 00:32:42,603
Hold on, I got this.

356
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:51,679
Who wants to go first?

357
00:33:09,342 --> 00:33:11,657
Oh, God!
What's that smell?

358
00:33:11,682 --> 00:33:14,600
Just try and find the fuse box.

359
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:15,976
Wow!

360
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:16,989
What?

361
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:20,901
Under the stairs.
It's where they discovered the red room.

362
00:33:21,384 --> 00:33:23,730
Whatever is in there,
gets inside your head.

363
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,945
Wouldn't find much in your head.

364
00:33:25,945 --> 00:33:28,382
They say this house
makes you see things.

365
00:33:28,445 --> 00:33:32,167
Infects your dreams until you can't
tell what's real and what's nightmare.

366
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:35,844
And then, boom! Blood splatter
and brain matter everywhere.

367
00:33:35,844 --> 00:33:38,631
Can we please just find the fuse box
so we can get out of here?

368
00:33:46,008 --> 00:33:48,207
Hey, I think I found it.

369
00:33:58,596 --> 00:34:00,493
My phone is dead.

370
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

371
00:34:10,535 --> 00:34:12,482
What the hell are you doing down here?

372
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:14,479
I could have killed you.

373
00:34:17,045 --> 00:34:19,398
We'll - We'll let ourselves out.

374
00:34:20,565 --> 00:34:22,353
Very nice meeting you.

375
00:34:23,664 --> 00:34:26,559
Since when do you carry a shotgun?
Jesus!

376
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:29,268
It was your father's for protection.

377
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:32,698
I really don't think I need protection
from my friends but thanks.

378
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:35,299
You're not allowed to have
friends over without asking me.

379
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:38,015
You know how easy it is
for James to get sick?

380
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,783
What are you talking about?
They weren't anywhere near him.

381
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:43,519
Someone was in his room.

382
00:34:43,763 --> 00:34:47,609
The door was open when I came over
but I shut it.

383
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:49,603
Then who took his blanket off?

384
00:34:51,368 --> 00:34:54,240
He's not some sideshow attraction.

385
00:34:55,481 --> 00:34:57,124
Go to bed.

386
00:35:02,886 --> 00:35:07,239
It's possible that he has something
called LIS. Locked-in syndrome.

387
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,524
- Does that mean he's conscious?
- I don't know.

388
00:35:09,736 --> 00:35:12,061
That means he may have a
sort of consciousness,

389
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:13,929
but it's locked into
an inactive body.

390
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:15,426
So, he is getting better.

391
00:35:15,451 --> 00:35:18,291
Well, looking at this fMRI scan and...

392
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:22,792
seeing the return of some limited
eye mobility, it would appear so.

393
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:25,335
And this thing will tell us for sure?

394
00:35:25,729 --> 00:35:28,987
The EEG machine measures brainwaves,

395
00:35:28,987 --> 00:35:33,444
the more activity on this monitor,
the stronger the emotional response.

396
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,643
You're ready to give a try?

397
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:42,285
All right.
Step into his line of sight.

398
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,297
Hi, Jimmy.

399
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:53,322
Hey.

400
00:36:03,707 --> 00:36:05,257
Jimmy.

401
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,097
Oh.

402
00:36:11,415 --> 00:36:14,009
That's a definite response.

403
00:36:15,546 --> 00:36:17,242
Candice.

404
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:19,770
Belle, come closer.

405
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,337
Mom?

406
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:43,068
Are you OK?

407
00:36:43,483 --> 00:36:45,453
Your brother's back.

408
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:48,407
Your brother's back.

409
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:55,184
It's just a fly, James,
don't worry about that.

410
00:37:31,787 --> 00:37:33,432
What's going on?

411
00:37:38,744 --> 00:37:40,626
I'm sorry, I...

412
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:44,296
I can't - I can't really
explain it but I...

413
00:37:44,628 --> 00:37:48,633
I don't think I can do anymore for you.

414
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:52,308
Doctor Milton?

415
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:13,080
Come on, Jimmy.

416
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:17,104
You're doing great.

417
00:38:17,601 --> 00:38:19,920
You're doing so great.

418
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:24,360
I love you so much.

419
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:29,709
Come on, let's try 
to move that thumb up.

420
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:34,394
Do you want me to rub your feet?

421
00:38:34,574 --> 00:38:37,399
You can blink once for "yes".

422
00:38:40,025 --> 00:38:42,013
That's OK.

423
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:44,830
That's OK.

424
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:52,867
Once it first happened, Belle said:
"Jimmy will never give up".

425
00:38:57,516 --> 00:38:59,879
OK. Out, out!

426
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:04,458
Go, now! Hey, hey, hey!
Out, Larry! Bad dog!

427
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:10,781
Don't worry,
I'll never let him hurt you.

428
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:15,316
I love you more than
anything in the world.

429

430
00:40:43,956 --> 00:40:45,566
James?

431
00:40:45,591 --> 00:40:47,601
Is that you?

432
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:57,288
What do you want?

433
00:40:57,449 --> 00:40:59,474
Come here!

434
00:41:32,317 --> 00:41:34,462
Where are you?

435
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
James?

436
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,479
Juliet?

437
00:41:54,372 --> 00:41:56,446
Juls, where are you?

438
00:43:01,856 --> 00:43:03,274
Hey, sis!

439
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,048
- Start with "yes" or "no" questions.
- OK.

440
00:43:25,073 --> 00:43:28,394
- Doctor Milton said that would be easiest for him.
- OK.

441
00:43:30,851 --> 00:43:32,284
Jimmy?

442
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:34,764
Sweetie?

443
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:37,364
Do you recognize me?

444
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:41,850
Belle?

445
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,540
James wants to talk to Didi.

446
00:43:45,565 --> 00:43:47,936
Will you help me find him?

447
00:43:57,144 --> 00:43:58,483
Belle?

448
00:43:58,632 --> 00:44:01,022
Come say hi to your brother.

449
00:44:01,075 --> 00:44:05,473
He's talking to us through the computer.
It's amazing. Come see!

450
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:11,352
It's called an AAC.

451
00:44:11,352 --> 00:44:15,055
He can use his eyes to choose letters
so he can communicate.

452
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:21,295
You can talk to your brother again.

453
00:44:21,383 --> 00:44:23,389
What do you wanna say to him?

454
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,624
I don't know.

455
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:29,087
Just talk to him slowly.

456
00:44:34,219 --> 00:44:36,856
Is that really you in there?

457
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,334
Wow, it's so cool!

458
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:50,777
I miss you.

459
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,210
He misses me too.

460
00:45:41,351 --> 00:45:44,790
I just never really told
anybody about this.

461
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:47,189
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

462
00:45:47,224 --> 00:45:49,035
No, erm...

463
00:45:51,003 --> 00:45:52,883
I should.

464
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:55,583
I really think I need to.

465
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:03,559
I- I was having a lot of problems...

466
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:07,509
with my family and with school...

467
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,328
In and out of a lot of
different programs.

468
00:46:12,866 --> 00:46:16,110
And I just started doing stupid shit.

469
00:46:16,631 --> 00:46:19,515
I sent these pictures to some guy...

470
00:46:19,672 --> 00:46:24,233
And then when I woke up the next morning,
they were all over the internet.

471
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:27,508
They were everywhere,
everyone had seen them.

472
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:30,628
Everyone at school and my Mom...

473
00:46:30,653 --> 00:46:32,755
And my brother...

474
00:46:33,201 --> 00:46:35,113
So, what happened?

475
00:46:36,855 --> 00:46:39,633
James wanted to find the guy who did it,

476
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:44,274
and he lived in a three-storey
apartment building...

477
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,943
There was a really big fight and...

478
00:46:49,627 --> 00:46:51,683
He went over the balcony.

479
00:46:54,575 --> 00:46:58,296
Look, you didn't do anything wrong.

480
00:46:58,296 --> 00:47:00,056
You know that, right?

481
00:47:00,298 --> 00:47:04,191
You know, I -
I really wanna believe that.

482
00:47:06,093 --> 00:47:08,655
And I keep telling myself...

483
00:47:09,036 --> 00:47:11,117
it was his choice.

484
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:16,468
He would do it again in a heartbeat.
I know he would.

485
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:18,291
Because...

486
00:47:20,606 --> 00:47:22,944
That's just who he was.

487
00:47:22,944 --> 00:47:25,202
That was who he is.

488
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,843
Belle, he's still alive,
you've just talked to him.

489
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:36,680
You're reading the wrong book.

490
00:48:37,344 --> 00:48:38,900
You know it.

491
00:48:41,182 --> 00:48:45,491
Only saying, is it a little weird that
your brother is in a comma for two years,

492
00:48:45,795 --> 00:48:49,590
and the minute you move into this new
house, he miraculously gets better?

493
00:48:52,423 --> 00:48:55,390
I don't - I don't know.

494
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:59,217
Unless, of course,
it's not really him anymore.

495
00:48:59,685 --> 00:49:01,885
What are you talking about?

496
00:49:02,642 --> 00:49:05,267
He's talking about a possession.

497
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:11,356
In 1974, the house drives Ronny DeFeo
to kill his whole family.

498
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,891
A year later, it nearly drives the next
family to do the exact same thing.

499
00:49:15,046 --> 00:49:18,764
And they blamed it on the red room,
that they discovered right there.

500
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:20,488
In the basement.

501
00:49:20,488 --> 00:49:22,510
See? It's right under
your brother's bed.

502
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,811
So, you're saying...

503
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,354
this evil thing latched onto my brother?

504
00:49:30,354 --> 00:49:34,210
OK, whoa, whoa, whoa, look, I hate to
bring everyone back down to Earth, but...

505
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:36,286
Other families have
lived in that house,

506
00:49:36,286 --> 00:49:39,564
nothing scary has happened
there for 40 years.

507
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:43,427
40 years, that's a very
significant number in the Bible.

508
00:49:43,427 --> 00:49:46,181
"And the land had peace 40 years".

509
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:50,649
So, maybe the evil only
 latches on every 40 years.

510
00:49:50,649 --> 00:49:53,344
- No, that's stupid.
- Dude, seriously? The Bible?

511
00:49:54,006 --> 00:49:57,024
Belle, you're not actually
buying this shit, are you?

512
00:49:58,255 --> 00:50:00,837
Well, you said he can talk now, right?

513
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,901
So, why don't you just ask him yourself?

514
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:06,922
Yeah, what's the worst
that could happen?

515
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:51,098
I need to ask you a question.

516
00:50:51,542 --> 00:50:53,493
Are you OK with that?

517
00:51:04,002 --> 00:51:06,169
Is someone else...

518
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:09,190
in there with you?

519
00:51:31,373 --> 00:51:33,578
What can I do to stop it?

520
00:51:33,578 --> 00:51:35,773
How can I help you?

521
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,124
No!

522
00:51:47,127 --> 00:51:49,607
No, I can't do that.

523
00:51:53,713 --> 00:51:55,461
No!

524
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:15,679
I love you so much.

525
00:52:29,221 --> 00:52:32,680
Are you sure you want to do this?

526
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:46,354
I'm gonna take this out.

527
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
You're the one who's gonna fucking die!

528
00:53:46,665 --> 00:53:50,408
Is he all right? Are you OK, honey?
What's going on?

529
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:52,739
Jimmy, are you OK?

530
00:53:52,764 --> 00:53:54,861
- What did you do?
- I...

531
00:53:54,886 --> 00:53:56,764
What did you do?

532
00:53:56,789 --> 00:53:58,960
You've no right to do this!

533
00:54:03,902 --> 00:54:05,876
He's breathing.

534
00:54:06,912 --> 00:54:09,160
He's breathing on his own!

535
00:54:13,824 --> 00:54:16,191
Jimmy wants to live.

536
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:19,885
He deserves to live.

537
00:54:20,282 --> 00:54:21,983
Get out.

538
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:25,778
If you touch him again,
I swear...

539
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:45,953
It's bad enough that he's trapped
in his own body and now he's...

540
00:54:45,978 --> 00:54:49,927
What? He's...
There's something in there with him?

541
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:52,182
What am I gonna do? I...

542
00:54:53,147 --> 00:54:55,103
I have to help him!

543
00:54:55,103 --> 00:54:58,172
Look, Belle, you have to help
your entire family, OK?

544
00:54:58,292 --> 00:55:01,200
I mean, whatever is in there
with James, if it wins,

545
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,270
you know, if it takes over
completely, it will kill everyone.

546
00:55:04,295 --> 00:55:06,115
Belle, you gotta get
your family out of there.

547
00:55:06,115 --> 00:55:08,473
Or we have to prove it
to your Mom somehow.

548
00:55:09,492 --> 00:55:12,572
Find a way to show her that
your brother is being controlled

549
00:55:12,572 --> 00:55:14,625
by whatever is in that house.

550
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,852
Belle?

551
00:56:01,709 --> 00:56:03,608
Why aren't you at school?

552
00:56:04,378 --> 00:56:06,379
I wasn't feeling well.

553
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:07,976
I'm sorry.

554
00:56:08,967 --> 00:56:10,911
I'm sure I'll be fine.

555
00:56:11,044 --> 00:56:14,707
No, I'm sorry about last night.

556
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:20,613
For what?

557
00:56:21,843 --> 00:56:24,945
If you hadn't pulled Jimmy
out of the respirator...

558
00:56:25,707 --> 00:56:28,469
We wouldn't know that
he could breathe on his own.

559
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:33,504
I know you were doing
what you thought was right.

560
00:56:34,406 --> 00:56:37,589
But now you know
how wrong it is.

561
00:56:37,693 --> 00:56:39,345
Right?

562
00:56:39,677 --> 00:56:42,473
Jimmy was always going to come back.

563
00:56:48,068 --> 00:56:51,520
You do want us to be a family again,
do you, Belle?

564
00:56:51,672 --> 00:56:53,327
Of course.

565
00:56:53,853 --> 00:56:55,361
Good.

566
00:56:59,942 --> 00:57:02,114
Get some rest, sweetie.

567
00:57:02,225 --> 00:57:04,060
I love you.

568
00:57:10,569 --> 00:57:13,456
Hey, James,
how you doing today?

569
00:57:23,262 --> 00:57:25,610
Outside walk.

570
00:57:25,962 --> 00:57:28,602
Those are your biggest words yet.

571
00:57:29,257 --> 00:57:32,567
You're doing so great!
Yes, we can!

572
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:13,359
- Honey! Be careful by the water, OK?
- OK!

573
00:58:47,396 --> 00:58:50,708
I don't know why it's so hard for
everyone to believe he's getting better.

574
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:52,941
Well, he's getting better
but don't you wanna know why?

575
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:54,075
Is it...?

576
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:03,519
I think a second opinion
would be good too.

577
00:59:03,555 --> 00:59:05,915
We can do that.
A second opinion is OK.

578
00:59:05,915 --> 00:59:07,910
Did you ask doctor Milton about this?

579
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:10,795
Hmm, I haven't been
in contact with him yet.

580
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

581
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,043
Juliet!

582
00:59:48,157 --> 00:59:51,705
What happened? You're OK?
Come here, baby, come on!

583
00:59:51,782 --> 00:59:53,996
What's wrong?
You tell me, what's wrong?

584
00:59:53,996 --> 00:59:55,735
It's Larry.

585
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:01,607
Don't look at him.

586
01:00:07,177 --> 01:00:10,369
<i>Is that a binding circle out the back?
A bounding circle?</i>

587
01:00:10,369 --> 01:00:11,788
<i>If they found an area was evil,</i>

588
01:00:11,877 --> 01:00:14,439
<i>they would do a ring around
with like salt or fire...</i>

589
01:00:14,439 --> 01:00:17,012
<i>to try to keep the
evil contained.</i>

590
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,697
It's gonna be OK.

591
01:00:50,426 --> 01:00:51,987
OK.

592
01:00:52,471 --> 01:00:54,649
All right. That's great.
Thank you.

593
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:58,676
So, the vet can be here first thing
tomorrow morning to pick up the body.

594
01:00:58,858 --> 01:01:01,880
Thank you for doing this.
Thanks for everything.

595
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,767
Of course!
Joan!

596
01:01:05,319 --> 01:01:07,261
- Don't worry about it.
- I know.

597
01:01:07,261 --> 01:01:09,948
- And Juliet is gonna be OK.
- I know.

598
01:01:11,148 --> 01:01:14,375
How about I come by and check on
everybody after my shift tonight?

599
01:01:14,612 --> 01:01:17,311
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, it sounds great.

600
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:18,522
OK.

601
01:01:34,177 --> 01:01:36,417
It can't leave the house.

602
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:39,766
Hey, Mom, I need to talk to you.

603
01:01:41,146 --> 01:01:44,617
Mom! Stop!
Are you listening to me?

604
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:48,496
Look, I know you're gonna
think I'm crazy, OK? But I...

605
01:01:48,569 --> 01:01:50,873
I got a really bad
feeling about this house.

606
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,626
I think it's doing
something to James, it's - it's...

607
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:57,921
It's like possessing him
or infecting him, I...

608
01:01:57,921 --> 01:01:59,522
I don't know.

609
01:02:00,901 --> 01:02:02,882
There's this room in
the basement, OK?

610
01:02:02,882 --> 01:02:04,975
I've been down there,
I've seen it myself.

611
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:09,866
I swear, I think that's what's
making him all of a sudden better.

612
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:14,702
Please, say something.

613
01:02:15,259 --> 01:02:18,067
I don't think you're crazy, sweetheart.

614
01:02:18,733 --> 01:02:21,037
I know about the red room.

615
01:02:21,927 --> 01:02:23,564
Come here.

616
01:02:29,102 --> 01:02:32,299
Wait... what did you just say?

617
01:02:32,324 --> 01:02:34,829
You know I always believed in God.

618
01:02:35,276 --> 01:02:37,777
And then your father got sick.

619
01:02:39,426 --> 01:02:44,277
We had to watch him rot away
from the inside from cancer.

620
01:02:44,704 --> 01:02:46,561
Everyday I prayed.

621
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:49,063
And then James got sick.

622
01:02:49,063 --> 01:02:51,118
And still I prayed.

623
01:02:52,967 --> 01:02:54,883
Two years.

624
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,511
The doctors had
given up on him, right?

625
01:02:57,511 --> 01:03:00,427
They said he'd never come back.
I won't accept that.

626
01:03:00,515 --> 01:03:02,917
What are you talking about?

627
01:03:03,617 --> 01:03:06,218
God gave up on us, sweetheart.

628
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:11,310
So, I gave up on God.

629
01:03:12,197 --> 01:03:14,379
And I moved us here.

630
01:03:15,397 --> 01:03:17,177
Because if...

631
01:03:17,309 --> 01:03:20,991
if there is some power...

632
01:03:22,095 --> 01:03:24,745
that can make your brother better...

633
01:03:24,797 --> 01:03:29,111
Better? No, Mom, you don't understand.
This isn't better.

634
01:03:29,111 --> 01:03:33,539
This house is evil,
this house is really bad.

635
01:03:33,697 --> 01:03:36,056
It's gonna drive James
to kill our own family,

636
01:03:36,056 --> 01:03:39,342
just like the DeFeo's...
You, me, Juliet...

637
01:03:39,342 --> 01:03:42,865
Stop, stop, come here.
No, no, no...

638
01:03:43,475 --> 01:03:46,574
James would never do that, OK?

639
01:03:46,825 --> 01:03:49,830
He would never do that.
He's getting better.

640
01:04:06,101 --> 01:04:08,115
Honey, come here.

641
01:04:08,115 --> 01:04:11,104
- Belle? - Get up!
- I need you to put this on, OK?

642
01:04:11,104 --> 01:04:13,565
I want you to hurry
and stay quiet. OK?

643
01:04:13,565 --> 01:04:14,714
Where are we going?

644
01:04:14,714 --> 01:04:16,255
I'll be right back. Shhh!

Come, sit down,
we're just about to start dinner.

652
01:05:49,408 --> 01:05:50,493
Hey, guess what, Belle?

653
01:05:50,493 --> 01:05:52,364
Chicken smells great, Mom...

Oh, hey, Belle!

655
01:05:56,501 --> 01:05:58,204

I hope you're hungry.
Mom made all this great food.

657
01:06:08,439 --> 01:06:10,967
Juliet, pass the chicken, please.

658
01:06:12,089 --> 01:06:14,270
Hey, this looks great!

659
01:06:20,861 --> 01:06:22,619
Where's your bed?

660
01:06:22,669 --> 01:06:24,289
In his room.

661
01:06:24,289 --> 01:06:27,308
It's about time we had
a proper dining-room.

662
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:29,227
Jimmy.

663
01:06:31,264 --> 01:06:32,577
Of course.

664
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:44,370
Dad would be so happy 
to see us all here together.

665
01:06:46,267 --> 01:06:49,522
- Don't you think, Mom?
- Yes, I do.

01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:37,193
- Pshh! be quiet!
- Tell me what's going on!

683
01:11:39,706 --> 01:11:41,161
Belle?

684
01:11:41,816 --> 01:11:44,243

685

Belle?

Juliet?

687
01:13:36,639 --> 01:13:38,164
Hi, Mom.

688
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,364
Hi, baby.

689
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:01,081
What are you doing with that?

690
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:05,734
Don't you recognize me, baby?

691
01:14:08,675 --> 01:14:10,471
Oh, God, no.

692
01:14:10,806 --> 01:14:13,489
God has nothing to do with this!

693
01:14:13,489 --> 01:14:16,346
Damn you to hell!

694
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,723
Too late.

695
01:15:02,061 --> 01:15:04,712
- I left Didi standing...
- Shhhh...!

696
01:15:36,541 --> 01:15:38,414
Where are you going?

697
01:15:47,618 --> 01:15:49,656
Is that Larry?

698
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:51,721
No, baby.

699
01:15:53,197 --> 01:15:56,843
I want you to go in the next door
neighbor's house and wait for me, OK?

700
01:16:08,085 --> 01:16:10,502
There you are, sweetie.

701
01:16:35,393 --> 01:16:38,492
James?
I'm scared.

702
01:16:38,575 --> 01:16:41,648
Shhhh!
Don't be scared.

703
01:16:42,212 --> 01:16:43,724
Didi.

704
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:48,403
We'll play a little game, OK?
OK, Juls.

705
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:50,502
I don't want to.

706
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:53,237
Turn over and go to sleep.

707
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:57,046
Do it!

708
01:17:04,762 --> 01:17:06,481
Stop!

709
01:17:07,264 --> 01:17:08,727
Don't hurt her.

710
01:17:08,785 --> 01:17:12,390
- You wouldn't hurt your brother, would you?
- You're not my brother.

711
01:17:12,684 --> 01:17:15,729
My brother died two years ago
and you know it.

712
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:18,086
Because of what  you did!

713
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,068
Belle!

714
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:03,299
It hurts so bad.

715
01:18:05,357 --> 01:18:08,420
I c-can't move.

716
01:18:08,592 --> 01:18:12,058
T-t-that wasn't me, Bell.

717
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,269
You have to believe me.

718
01:18:15,269 --> 01:18:17,047
I swear!

719
01:18:18,044 --> 01:18:20,126
Please!

720
01:18:23,027 --> 01:18:24,934
Help me.

721
01:18:27,422 --> 01:18:29,436
I miss you!

722
01:18:30,114 --> 01:18:31,733
Please!

723
01:18:35,682 --> 01:18:37,920
I'm so sorry!

724
01:18:39,628 --> 01:18:41,873
I'm so sorry!

725
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:46,031
I'm sorry about everything.
I love you.

726
01:18:46,609 --> 01:18:48,351
Help me.

727
01:18:48,504 --> 01:18:50,902
Take me back inside.

728
01:18:52,731 --> 01:18:57,793
It's - It's what Mom would have wanted.

729
01:19:00,233 --> 01:19:04,765
You don't wanna disappoint her, do you?

730
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:10,577
Mom is dead, so is Juliet.

731
01:19:11,659 --> 01:19:15,353
All we have is each other now.

732
01:19:18,036 --> 01:19:19,807
Liar!

733
01:19:21,419 --> 01:19:23,164
You're not James.

734
01:19:23,164 --> 01:19:24,443
You're a liar!

735
01:19:24,657 --> 01:19:25,571
No!

736
01:19:25,617 --> 01:19:27,607
You're not James!

737
01:19:28,857 --> 01:19:30,763
I don't wanna die!

738
01:19:33,983 --> 01:19:36,419
(INDISTINCT)

739
01:19:41,212 --> 01:19:43,032
It's me!
No!

740
01:19:43,219 --> 01:19:44,261
Why?

741
01:19:44,261 --> 01:19:47,314
No! No! No! No!

742
01:19:48,779 --> 01:19:49,779
No!

743
01:19:52,897 --> 01:19:54,174
Please!

744
01:20:15,092 --> 01:20:16,540
Hey.

745
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:22,834
Thank you.

746
01:20:36,522 --> 01:20:37,933
Belle?

747
01:20:40,215 --> 01:20:42,005
- Belle?
- Juliet?

748
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:43,478
Belle!

749
01:20:43,688 --> 01:20:45,054
Juliet?

750
01:20:45,054 --> 01:20:46,806
Oh, my God!

751
01:20:48,262 --> 01:20:49,447
Baby!

752
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:53,326
Hey, let me see you, are you all right?
Are you hurt?

753
01:20:54,868 --> 01:20:57,003
What happened to James?

754
01:20:57,239 --> 01:20:59,651
He was gonna hurt us, baby.

755
01:20:59,651 --> 01:21:03,928
But he's in a - he's in better place now. 
I promise.

756
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:07,970
OK, now, listen to me, Juliet,
the police are gonna be here really soon.

757
01:21:07,995 --> 01:21:10,669
I'm gonna tell them
exactly what happened.

758
01:21:10,694 --> 01:21:12,844
But I need you to do the same, OK?

759
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:15,566
James tried to hurt us 
and I need you Te tell them that.

760
01:21:15,595 --> 01:21:17,335
Right, baby?

761
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:19,616
- Yes.
- Yeah?

762
01:21:25,483 --> 01:21:27,894
Do you think they'll believe us?

763
01:21:34,391 --> 01:21:39,056
<i>Tragedy has struck once again at 
112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, Long Island.</i>

764
01:21:39,056 --> 01:21:43,500
<i>The infamous house where Ronny DeFeo
killed his entire family with a shotgun.</i>

765
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,744
<i>More than four decades ago.</i>

766
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:50,029
<i>Police are questioning 17-year old
Belle Walker as a person of interest</i>

767
01:21:50,029 --> 01:21:51,999
<i>in the brutal murders
of her aunt Candice,</i>

768
01:21:51,999 --> 01:21:55,433
<i>her mother Joan
and the death of her brother James.</i>

769
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:58,773
<i>Miss Walker claims that
her brother committed the crimes,</i>

770
01:21:58,773 --> 01:22:02,856
<i>and her story is being corroborated 
by her seven-year old sister, Juliet.</i>

771
01:22:02,856 --> 01:22:05,148
<i>A spokesman for the
Amityville Police Department</i>

772
01:22:05,148 --> 01:22:08,581
<i>said that forensic evidence does
point to James as the killer.</i>

773
01:22:08,581 --> 01:22:11,443
<i>His fingerprints were found 
on the murder weapon.</i>

774
01:22:11,479 --> 01:22:14,493
<i>But doctor Ken Milton
refutes that claim,</i>

775
01:22:14,493 --> 01:22:17,354
<i>stating that James Walker was
too weak to get out of bed.</i>

776
01:22:17,394 --> 01:22:20,418
<i>Let alone stalk his entire
family with a shotgun.</i>

777
01:22:20,418 --> 01:22:22,321
<i>But two years prior
to the murders,</i>

778
01:22:22,321 --> 01:22:25,193
<i>James was in a comma,
a vegetative state.</i>

779
01:22:26,114 --> 01:22:29,757
<i>Is this house a source of evil, 
as legend suggests?</i>

780
01:22:29,757 --> 01:22:34,063
<i>Did it awaken and possess 
James Walker or his sister Belle?</i>

781
01:22:34,323 --> 01:22:37,800
<i>For now the police are left
with a horrific unsolved crime.</i>

782
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:43,098
<i>And Amityville, Long Island, is once again,
the center of shock and horror.</i>
