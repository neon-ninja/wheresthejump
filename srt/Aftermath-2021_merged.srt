1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,763
Ma'am, are you still there?

2
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,015
Yes.

3
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,683
What is your location?

4
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:20,395
- I'm in… in my house, and he's…

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,191
Ma'am?

6
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,822
Ma'am? What is your location?

7
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,158
Please! Please! No! Please!

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,081
Ma'am?

9
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:41,875
Ma'am!

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,839
Ma'am, are you still there?

11
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,487
A normal-sized gun
would've done the exact same job.

12
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,406
Please stop talking.

13
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,325
You're telling me you wouldn't prefer
just a nice, clean overdose?

14
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,536
It's a Tuesday afternoon,
for Christ's sake.

15
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,664
Guys, can we please focus?
We're already running behind. Come on.

16
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,958
Got some protein ready for disposal.

17
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,252
Teeth.

18
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,463
The guy used a gun that size

19
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,258
knowing he was gonna
put a Jackson Pollock on the wall.

20
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,802
All I'm saying is
that's kind of a douche move.

21
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,470
You can't call a dead man a douche.

22
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,597
-Why not?
- Because it's insensitive.

23
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,851
Uh, morning, ma'am.

24
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,436
The inside of the house is clean.

25
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,770
Sorry about that.

26
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,189
Is this… I don't know,
is this funny to you?

27
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,025
You get off
joking about people's tragedies?

28
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,736
No. No, not at all.

29
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,779
Oh, no? So you're just an asshole?

30
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,031
Or do you prefer douche?

31
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,368
Okay, why don't I take you on a walk
to sign off on everything, okay?

32
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,870
After you.

33
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,997
Just want to confirm
that is your current address

34
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,957
-in case we have to get a hold of you.
-Yes.

35
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,751
-Okay, last one.
-Thank you for your help.

36
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,835
You're welcome.

37
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,254
And again,
I apologize for my team's behavior.

38
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,340
We really are sorry for your loss.
Thank you for choosing us.

39
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,134
Let's hope it's a one-off.

40
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,284
Hello?

41
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,245
- Are you sitting down?
-Uh, kind of.

42
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,872
We have an interested financier.

43
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,041
-You're kidding.
-I am beyond busy.

44
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,334
I don't have time for humor.

45
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,880
-Oh, my God! Who? When? Where?

46
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,216
Lead investor's
finishing up a deal on the East Coast.

47
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,761
You have a meeting
at the end of the month. 29th, 3:00 p.m.

48
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,888
-Oh, gotta go.
-Bye.

49
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,391
Oh, my God.

50
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,483
Need a ride?

51
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,319
Do guys really think that works?

52
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,656
Oh, no, seriously, like,
"Ah, he whistled at me.

53
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:27,077
He must be a really nice guy
and, wow, he drives a Toyota?

54
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,204
I gotta jump on that ship right now."

55
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,705
-Yeah, maybe.

56
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,792
Well, so you know, I am on my way
to surprise my husband.

57
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,211
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

58
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,004
What's the surprise?

59
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,590
Oh, you know, not something insane.
It's just…

60
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,843
I might've found an investor to get
my brick and mortar store running.

61
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,347
Are you serious?
Let's get you home.

62
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,393
-Hi.
-Hi.

63
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,655
I don't know how to say this nicely,
but you're…

64
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,699
you're kinda crowding me
just a little bit.

65
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,159
- You're such a jerk.
-Stop.

66
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,286
Stop trying…

67
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,288
Oh, whoa.

68
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,956
-I'm sorry.
-Easy! Watch the boys.

69
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,417
-It was an accident, I promise.
-Yeah, right.

70
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,419
-Hey.
-What?

71
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,213
Do me a favor.
Don't leave me in the dust, all right?

72
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,923
-Shut up.

73
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,343
And, you know,
it's still a maybe. I don't know.

74
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,680
You're too good for this not to work out.
You know that, right?

75
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,207
I can't do this.

76
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,012
How are things
going for you, Kevin?

77
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,764
I'm not even mad anymore.

78
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,184
Honestly, I… I just feel numb.

79
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,230
It's not about the affair,
it's about betrayal.

80
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,030
You give your whole life to somebody

81
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,240
and they're only
giving you half of theirs?

82
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,785
And the whole time, you have no idea.

83
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,999
And how's it going
in the romantic department?

84
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:48,718
In the aftermath of an affair,
room is made for a new kind of truth.

85
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,847
A new kind of understanding
and communication.

86
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:57,560
But you cannot sit in ruin,
waiting for it to rebuild itself.

87
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,355
Have you considered
a change of environment?

88
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,192
Uh, of course.
I mean, that would be ideal.

89
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,112
Excellent. The truth of the matter is…

90
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,365
your first marriage is over.

91
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,034
Can we all agree on that?

92
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,913
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

93
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,666
Now you need
to ask yourselves,

94
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:24,462
would you like to create
a second one together…

95
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,094
and take action?

96
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,221
Make the change.

97
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:38,393
Give yourselves
the gift of a new environment.

98
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,607
I mean, she's right.
Your first marriage is kinda shot to shit.

99
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,485
What? I'm just being honest…

100
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,655
which sounds like the missing link here,
so you're welcome.

101
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,283
I'm just terrified
that he's never gonna forgive me.

102
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,784
You fucked up, sure,

103
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,038
but you know, he's not the only victim
in this situation.

104
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,749
I know you won't say this
'cause you'd rather take the blame.

105
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,042
-I'll say it for you.
-Don't.

106
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,460
Your needs weren't being met.

107
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,295
I can't use that as an excuse.

108
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,964
It's not an excuse, it's reality.

109
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,008
Look, I have a deadline here, okay?

110
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,760
I can't go back and forth about this.

111
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,595
-He pulled away from you, Nat.
-Yeah.

112
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,264
Well, I think that
anyone who found their brother

113
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,975
hanging in a closet
would've done the same thing.

114
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,479
-Come on, Natalie.
-Can you just hand me the floral print?

115
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,860
Hey what are you doing home already?

116
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,945
I just finished early today.

117
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,823
Not interrupting anything, am I?

118
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,492
No, no. Not at all.

119
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,786
-Hey, Dani.
-How's it going?

120
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,624
Oh, uh, shit. You know what?

121
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,001
I gotta… I gotta go. I got work stuff.

122
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,796
-I'll text you later.
-Okay.

123
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,089
See you.

124
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,470
Uh, I want to run something past you.
You have a minute?

125
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,806
Are you fucking insane?

126
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,850
No I'm trying to heed the advice
that we've been paying for.

127
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,686
Take a look at the house.

128
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,105
-No, thank you.
-Look.

129
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,857
I talked to the owner.
She's gonna give us a great price.

130
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,026
You already talked to the owner?

131
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,237
Well, yeah.

132
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,490
I'm taking action.
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?

133
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,951
Why would you talk to someone
about buying a house

134
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,120
before even asking me. That's not--

135
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,080
You don't understand
This place is perfect.

136
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,456
It's disturbing.

137
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,334
I promise you wouldn't be able
to tell what happened there.

138
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,877
I know. I cleaned it, myself.

139
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,089
I don't want to move into a house
where there was a murder-suicide.

140
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,592
It was unfortunate what happened.
Okay. But shit happens every day.

141
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,427
Are you really being
that cavalier about it?

142
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,305
We live in the the 21st century, Natalie.

143
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,015
Wherever we move, there'll be history,

144
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,351
and I'm willing to bet
that it's not gonna be great.

145
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:47,105
-Domestic abuse, child pornography--
-Please. I don't want to move into a house

146
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,440
where I'm haunted
by the image of someone's brains

147
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,110
being splattered
all over the living room wall.

148
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,740
Well, I don't want to sleep in a bed
where I have to relive my wife

149
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,409
sucking another guy's dick.

150
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,916
You stopped helping yourself.

151
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,710
You dropped out of college.

152
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,713
You wouldn't talk to me.
Let alone go anywhere near me.

153
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,093
I had a moment of weakness,
and I hate myself for that.

154
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,972
But you cannot keep punishing me.

155
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,937
- I know.

156
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,775
I'm going to sleep on the couch, okay?

157
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,334
Hey.

158
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,668
Hey.

159
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,840
It… it has to have a home office.

160
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,428
Okay.

161
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:05,975
And we're really gonna
have to cut back on our expenses.

162
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,227
At least until this deal goes through.

163
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,355
I can do that.

164
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,400
And you have to go back to college.

165
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,322
Kevin, I can't watch you
throw your life away anymore.

166
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,411
Okay.

167
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,498
Promise me.

168
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,752
I promise.

169
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,297
Okay.

170
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,228
Wow.

171
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,025
Thanks again
for walking through with us.

172
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,860
We know this is not easy for you.

173
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:58,820
Of course.

174
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,238
Hey what is that, right there?

175
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,949
Oh, remote locks.

176
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,035
There's an app
that you can link your phones to.

177
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,912
Wow! I didn't even know that was a thing.

178
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,581
Yeah, you're going to find
a lot of that stuff here.

179
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:14,377
Um, there were some technical difficulties
here and there with the cameras.

180
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,296
I… I guess you would
have to call the company to set it up.

181
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,590
As you guys already know,

182
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,926
my brother and his wife
designed everything here,

183
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,430
so you're gonna get
a lot of expensive extras at a low cost.

184
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,267
-Um, guys, wait till you see outside.
- Yeah.

185
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,813
Whoa! I mean it pretty much
speaks for itself.

186
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,606
Wow.

187
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,653
I know that this is not
an ideal situation for anyone,

188
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:45,116
but this back yard
and the closet space, right?

189
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,579
Look, Claudia,
we're obviously very interested,

190
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,457
but I'll be honest with you.
It's been a rough couple of years.

191
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,208
I know it's not what you offered.

192
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,086
But it's what we can afford.

193
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,466
If you can say yes to that number,
we can sign the paperwork today.

194
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,013
We really need a fresh start.

195
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,141
Please, let's talk about this.

196
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,103
The truth is,

197
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,397
we haven't had a prospective buyer
in months.

198
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,651
I don't know, I guess
people scare off easily these days.

199
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,364
Add another 20k and it's yours.

200
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,865
-Yes! Yes!

201
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,868
Oh, my God, you have no idea
how much this means to us.

202
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,037
We're just as happy
to have it off our hands.

203
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,539
And I know that you guys
will be really happy here.

204
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,417
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

205
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,252
Thank you so much.

206
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,170
Thanks, man.

207
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,508
-Enjoy the house.
- Oh, Robert.

208
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,679
-Oh, my God.
-Yes, we just bought a house.

209
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,899
Well, Odi loves it.

210
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,237
So? It's beautiful, right?

211
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,239
It's something.

212
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,366
So that's where he killed her?

213
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,619
Ugh! So creepy.

214
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,704
Thank you.

215
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,541
Please, I am just
pointing out the obvious.

216
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,710
Nice plot of land.

217
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,712
Perfect for burying murder victims.

218
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,764
Are you, uh, sure this is a good decision?

219
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,852
Just seems like a lot
to go through to get laid, that's all.

220
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,146
Okay, well,
in case you didn't notice

221
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,732
the moving boxes you helped carry in,
it's a little late for that.

222
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:45,153
As mom or Gandhi would say,
"It's never too late."

223
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,281
Uh, Gandhi never said that,
and mom is an idiot.

224
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,160
You know, that is very harsh,
on both parties.

225
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,121
Dead body!

226
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,206
-I called it!

227
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,803
Oh, that is all you.

228
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,919
Oh, Jesus.

229
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,797
-Is that where he pulled her out from?
-Dani, stop!

230
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,427
You know, it's her own fault,
hiding in a closet

231
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,929
instead of using the front door.

232
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,973
What?

233
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,351
All right, come on, you little freak.

234
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

235
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,655
Oh! Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry, baby! Are you okay?

236
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,031
I don't know. Is it bleeding?

237
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,700
-No. What the hell were you doing?

238
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,119
-I was joking!
-It's not funny!

239
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,548
It's your turn.

240
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,967
Mmm-mmm.
I can't hear you. I'm fast asleep.

241
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,096
- No.
-No. No. No, I don't want to.

242
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,473
Okay, okay, okay.

243
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,520
Come on, Odi.

244
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,564
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

245
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,990
-Come on, Odi. Inside.

246
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,162
There's nothing left to pee on.

247
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,417
Odi, come on. Let's go.

248
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,505
Odi, come on. You're killing me.

249
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,469
Hey, shh!

250
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,847
All right, fine. Stay. I'm going to bed.

251
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,948
Jesus. What?
Why are you looking at me like that?

252
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,993
Did you just use the bathroom?

253
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,787
No, but Odi did.
He took his sweet-ass time, too.

254
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,706
Kevin, someone is in the bathroom.

255
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,915
What?

256
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,876
Someone came in here
and went to the bathroom.

257
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,419
I thought it was you.

258
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,967
Kevin?

259
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,519
No. There's nobody in here.

260
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,524
That's not possible.

261
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,110
He'd have to be pretty skinny
for me to miss him.

262
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,989
-Hmm.

263
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,999
You have to sleep.

264
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,836
It's our first night here.
Don't spook yourself out.

265
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,295
Let's go to bed.

266
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,756
-Fine.
-Thank you.

267
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,483
What the fuck?

268
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,447
I'm not mad about it.
I just didn't pay for it.

269
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,948
So, if it's free, I'll keep it.

270
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,658
What do you mean you can't refund it?

271
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,952
-I didn't order it.
-Have you seen my keys anywhere?

272
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,955
Yeah, it's my name and my address,
but I personally didn't order it.

273
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,750
-Kevin. Kevin, keys.
-I have to call you back.

274
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,544
Hey, where was the last place you had 'em?

275
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,630
My desk, but I've searched
the entire office, and they're not there.

276
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,133
Right. So that's probably not
the last place you had them.

277
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,260
Hmm. You know what?
I never really thought of that.

278
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,305
It's amazing how some people could really
put it into perspective for you.

279
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,931
-Hey.

280
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,350
Mmm.

281
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:12,563
I'm sorry. I'm just… I'm late, and
I slept like shit and I look like shit.

282
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,064
Babe, you look beautiful.

283
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,609
And you are gonna do great today.

284
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:23,824
Okay, that, truly not what it looks like.

285
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,451
Don't to be ashamed.
It's a magazine.

286
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,328
It's weird, 'cause you have the Internet.

287
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,871
-Can we look for your keys?
-Yes.

288
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,875
Look, I told you,
I already excavated the entire place.

289
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,043
It's not there.

290
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,632
I swear to God I checked there.

291
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,927
Well, maybe God's just having an off day
and he's trying to fuck with you.

292
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,429
-Don't you have some porn to go look at?
-I love you.

293
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,806
I love you, too.

294
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,100
Oh, um, I know you have a crazy day
between work and class,

295
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,561
so I packed your lunch.
It's in the fridge. Blue lid.

296
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,731
Okay. Go on, get lost.

297
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,358
-Bye.
-Bye.

298
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,125
My youngest daughter, God love her,
is an absolute nightmare.

299
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,336
-Thank you.
-Especially when it comes to wardrobe.

300
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,257
The amount of gifts
that I've had to return

301
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,759
could clothe an entire
Third World country.

302
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,596
She's worn three of your samples
in the last week.

303
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:34,103
I think you have a really good eye
for color, and texture, and quality.

304
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,856
A female entrepreneur.
An intelligent one of that.

305
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,569
-Before opening up your own location,

306
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:45,573
we'd like to establish you
as a brand name.

307
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,700
Is that an offer?

308
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:52,580
We can have you in anywhere
between 150 and 250 stores

309
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:53,872
by the end of the season.

310
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,165
Is this the part where I leave

311
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,710
and pretend to think about it,
or can I just accept now?

312
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,837
-No, you can wait.
-No, I would love to.

313
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,255
- Great!
-Thank you.

314
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,090
-Can I hug you?
-Of course.

315
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,925
Thank you so much!

316
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,552
I'm going out of town next week,

317
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,179
but my associate will be handling
the preliminary process.

318
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,389
Okay.

319
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:26,447
I want you to modernize the structure
using the original foundation.

320
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,865
Guess what? You get to pair up.

321
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,075
Yes. So, look around. Find a partner.

322
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,494
Someone that's probably smarter than you.

323
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,204
You might actually learn something.

324
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:39,460
Take this seriously.
This is half of your grade.

325
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,962
Don't procrastinate.
Check in with each other.

326
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,465
Meet up at a coffee shop, go to a house.

327
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:49,053
I don't care. If you need help, email me.
Don't call. I won't answer.

328
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,681
You again?

329
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,351
Yes, me.
I'm stalking you, didn't you know?

330
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,685
Yeah, I kinda figured.

331
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:00,898
-So, Kevin?
-So, Avery?

332
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,694
Oh, that's a little presumptuous.

333
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:10,240
Okay, well, we're partners now,
so I have to be able to reach you.

334
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:14,328
-Thank you for making it super weird.
- There you go.

335
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:19,083
All right, Kevin, I'll see you in class.

336
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,794
Don't worry, because this is going to be

337
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,673
the single fucking greatest
class project of all time.

338
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:26,840
-Just saying.
-Okay.

339
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,217
History of mankind.

340
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,096
Uh…

341
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,809
All right, if this is all to show me
Odi's vomit again, I swear--

342
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,228
Okay, shut it. You're ruining the moment.

343
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,064
Oh, my God.

344
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,692
Wow!

345
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,902
-Who's the lucky lady?
-Mmm.

346
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,909
-Oh.

347
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,496
Um, who, me?

348
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,581
-'Sup?
-"'Sup?"

349
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,792
Never mind.

350
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,044
I'm going to hang with Odi.
At least he appreciates me.

351
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,046
-No, no, no. I appreciate you.
-Yeah, right.

352
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,381
I do.

353
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,216
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Come here.

354
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,052
I just figured that if they offered you
a deal, we could celebrate,

355
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,930
and if it's wrong and they didn't,
then we can just get drunk.

356
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,014
Forget about it.

357
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,815
-Mmm.
-Ah.

358
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,526
God! You have no idea
how badly I needed that.

359
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,486
I'm proud of you, Nat.

360
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,281
And not just because
you chugged that whole thing.

361
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,993
But you really deserve this.

362
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,372
Kev?

363
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,502
Hey, you okay?

364
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,546
Yeah. Yeah.

365
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,132
It's just, um…

366
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,968
-just a bad dream.
-Hmm.

367
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,762
You know, I was thinking about tonight.

368
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,807
-Yeah?
-It was really nice.

369
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,102
-Mmm-hmm.
-I missed the way you sound.

370
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:15,564
Yeah, me, too.

371
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,069
Especially when I do this.

372
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,406
Mmm.

373
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,944
Mmm.

374
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,280
I'm gonna miss you today.

375
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,616
-Oh, really?
-Mmm-hmm.

376
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,327
-That's new.

377
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,413
Well, my meeting is done at 5:00,

378
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,624
so I was thinking maybe
we could grab dinner.

379
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,668
-Watch a movie.

380
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,253
I wish. I got called on site.

381
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:04,131
Oh, I thought you were gonna
cut back on your hours.

382
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,633
Yeah, but I'm trying
to get ahead of the expenses.

383
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,926
Just be smart about it.

384
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,302
Hmm. That's new.

385
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:12,222
You're a jerk. A very beautiful jerk.

386
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,182
Oh, so I've heard.

387
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,059
-Cocky.
-No.

388
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:19,020
It's just my way of saying
thank you for the note.

389
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,606
What note?

390
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,361
-Kevin Dadich?
-Yeah.

391
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,737
Sign right here, please?

392
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,198
Okay. What exactly am I signing for?

393
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,993
-Um…
-Okay. Here.

394
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,787
-Thank you. Have a nice day.
-Okay.

395
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:44,379
They racked up $2,000
worth of porn in your bank account?

396
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:45,630
-Yeah.
-Wow.

397
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:50,010
A ghost sighting and identity theft
in one day. That's pretty badass.

398
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,179
-It wasn't a ghost.
-What kind of porn is it?

399
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,309
What? I'm just trying to help.
Maybe I know some people who want it.

400
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,352
Unbelievable.

401
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,484
You know, maybe
it's a paranoid hallucination.

402
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,818
I don't know. Think about it.

403
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:10,197
Pressure of starting a new business,
the stuff with you guys, the new move.

404
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,073
It is kind of a lot at once.

405
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:16,745
Dude, are you gonna listen to me
or you're just gonna text?

406
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,665
-Oh, no. I'm gonna text.
- Burn.

407
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,213
Are you serious?

408
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,298
-Who's Avery?
-Nobody.

409
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,218
Some cute girl he shouldn't be texting,
but he is anyway.

410
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,553
-Stop.

411
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:35,972
What? Is that not accurate?

412
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,974
Okay. It's all contained in one room.

413
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,810
-Let's get it cleaned up quickly.
-No. Wait a minute.

414
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,730
Who is she? Where did you meet?
And did you touch bathing suit parts?

415
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,565
No, you aging pervert.

416
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,692
We're meeting up later
to work on some class stuff.

417
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,819
-So the sooner we get done--
-Is she cute?

418
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,279
-Yeah!
-I'm not gonna answer that.

419
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,782
-Why not?

420
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,283
Because she's cute.

421
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:59,454
-No. Because it doesn't matter.
-Sounds like karmic retribution.

422
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,872
Yeah, because she's cute.

423
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,083
Just so you guys know,
things between Natalie and I

424
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,376
have been much better lately.

425
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,628
-Oh.
-Yeah, like, much better.

426
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,923
-Aside from the paranoid hallucinations.
-Okay, guys, come on, let's go.

427
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,842
But everything else is so much better.
Oh, it's so better.

428
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,595
-Yeah. Nope. Pass.
- Please.

429
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,974
Dani, I don't have time right now.
I have to get ready for a meeting.

430
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,768
Oh, come on. After everything
I helped you with last year?

431
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,771
-Really? You're gonna guilt trip me now?

432
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,481
Only because mom is guilt tripping me.

433
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,650
Besides, I already told her
you're hosting dinner.

434
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,901
-What?

435
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,820
Dani, the last time
that mom came into town,

436
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,196
we had to check you into rehab.

437
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,657
If you want to have a relationship
with her, do your thing.

438
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,451
Okay? But I decided a long time ago,
I don't wanna deal with it.

439
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,078
I never ask you for anything.

440
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,248
That is definitely not true. Odi,
I have been playing with you all morning.

441
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,500
She's probably gonna go MIA
again after this anyway.

442
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,878
What is so bad about a slightly
painful dinner every few years?

443
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,046
Fine.

444
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,467
You can bring her here, okay?

445
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,469
But that is as much effort
as I'm putting in.

446
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:57,804
-Okay.

447
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,307
Okay, look, I have to get ready
for this meeting, okay?

448
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,391
Goodbye.

449
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,730
-Did you get it stuck?

450
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,108
Oh, yeah, right in the middle.

451
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:17,240
Okay.

452
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,430
Hi, I'm checking in
under Dadich.

453
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,766
Perfect. The other member
of your party just arrived.

454
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,726
Oh, great. Thank you.

455
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,691
-Hey, stranger.
-Nick.

456
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,818
it's good to see you.

457
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,195
Yeah, you, too.

458
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,698
If you wanna just follow me this way.

459
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:40,824
Uh, yes. Sorry.

460
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,827
I don't mean to be rude,
but actually have a business meeting, so--

461
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,578
Yeah, I know.

462
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,791
Natalie, wait. Just hear me out.

463
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,543
You know I can't be seeing you right now.

464
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,337
-If Kevin finds out about this--
-It's on me. Okay?

465
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,965
You just tell him that you had no idea
and that's the truth.

466
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,383
Why didn't you tell me?

467
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,344
Because I knew you wouldn't come.

468
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,473
A heads up would've been nice
before I signed the paperwork.

469
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,101
I know. You have every right to be mad.
I get it.

470
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,020
But you're talented, Natalie.

471
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,106
And I'm not letting you
throw away an opportunity

472
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,067
over whatever happened between us.
It's stupid.

473
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:20,238
Anne really likes you, okay?
All I did was provide the info. That's it.

474
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:25,660
Will you come inside?
Take the meeting? Please?

475
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,165
Fine.

476
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,586
Fuck it. I'm going in for another shot.
You want one?

477
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,754
No, I'm good.

478
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,047
You sure? It's a 100% agave.

479
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,424
Yeah. I gotta drive.

480
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:44,554
Dude, you do realize we have, like,
two solid hours of work ahead of us?

481
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,599
All right. Yeah, I guess
I have to then.

482
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:50,560
Huh.

483
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,437
What is that? West Elm?

484
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,190
Uh, close. It's a hand-me-down
from my brother.

485
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,030
Cheers.

486
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,624
So, what about you?
Do you have any siblings, or…

487
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,585
Um… yeah, a brother.

488
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,504
Be honest. Is he…

489
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,798
the good looking one?

490
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,051
He was, actually.

491
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,845
What? And then he got fat?

492
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,769
No, he died.

493
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,147
Oh, my God, dude.

494
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,983
Fuck, I am so sorry.

495
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,486
I am just so insensitive.

496
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,112
-I'm sorry.
-No, you're okay.

497
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:48,159
If you ever needed someone
to talk to or anything…

498
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

499
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

500
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:16,748
So, 30 feet from the load-bearing beam
is the first floor egress.

501
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,753
Is this getting too cerebral for you?

502
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,796
No, uh…

503
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,091
-I think it's just a sinus issue.
-You want some nasal spray?

504
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:30,428
Um, I'm gonna pass on the used
nasal spray. Thank you, though.

505
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,764
Hey, hey, hey. It's organic.

506
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,725
-Clever upsell, but I think I'll live.

507
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,810
I should get home anyway.

508
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,646
All right, I'll walk you out.

509
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,873
Wake up.

510
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,711
Easy. It's just me.

511
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,714
What are you doing sleeping on the couch?

512
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,176
Uh…

513
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,096
I don't… I don't know.

514
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:14,639
Come on.

515
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:17,892
What's wrong?

516
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,271
Kevin, someone was in here.

517
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,817
No, no, I know what you're gonna say.
It was another nightmare.

518
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,820
But it was so vivid. Kevin, I felt it.

519
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,489
Look, the door was locked.
You were passed out down there,

520
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,491
-probably working--
-You're not listening!

521
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,326
It was real, Kevin!

522
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,245
You're calling me a liar.

523
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,580
No. That's what you're choosing to hear.

524
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:42,000
All right, let's just talk feelings.

525
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,251
Pissed off.

526
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,003
Kevin.

527
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,963
Yeah, I can tell she is pissed.

528
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,923
No. How are you feeling?

529
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,884
Frustrated? I don't know.

530
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,513
Look, my point is, is that we've both been
going through some difficult changes.

531
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,223
We have this dinner with her mother

532
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,308
that neither one of us are
looking forward to.

533
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:02,687
Maybe all the stress is
an accumulation of these things.

534
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,647
How does that explain what I saw?

535
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,152
Paranoid hallucinations.

536
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,622
No.

537
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,084
We'll not gonna act like this
with each other.

538
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,462
I never thought
you would take a side opposite me.

539
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,421
I'm not!

540
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:33,009
I'm just trying to think of
every rational explanation, Nat.

541
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,344
I hate seeing you like this.

542
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,557
If I could take this all away and
make it my own, you know I would.

543
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,075
Let's go have a shitty meal with your mom.

544
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,077
Okay.

545
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,974
-Jesus Christ, Odi!

546
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,810
Gave me a freakin' heart attack.

547
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,930
Yes, Nat, I fed your dog.

548
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,406
Odi?

549
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,798
Odi?

550
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,059
Odi.

551
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,652
Nat?

552
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:04,994
Odi.

553
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,430
Odi.

554
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:38,611
Hey, little guy.

555
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,446
You doing okay?

556
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,286
Okay. I'll give you your space.

557
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,011
Fuck this.

558
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,062
Odi?

559
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,106
Where'd you go?

560
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,604
What the fuck?

561
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:39,435
Dani?

562
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,566
Dani.

563
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,819
-I'll just check upstairs.
-Mmm-mmm.

564
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,034
Un-fucking-believable.

565
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:58,078
Let me guess. She's not upstairs.

566
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,748
Well, maybe she went out to
get some last-minute stuff.

567
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,333
She's not the most organized.

568
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,252
I know, but I told her she needed
to be here to feed Odi.

569
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,795
Okay, so we'll feed him now.

570
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,715
Kevin, he's been home alone all day!

571
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,592
Look, I'm sure he's down here somewhere.

572
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,760
Odi?

573
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,136
Odi, come on, bud!

574
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,597
-Odi.

575
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,140
-Ugh.

576
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:21,268
Hi, baby. You okay?

577
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,564
You know, I knew she was going to do this.

578
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,316
This is why I don't want to be involved.

579
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,276
She tries to plan
these things with my mom,

580
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,071
and then they get into it,
and I have to clean up the mess.

581
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,782
And it's such bullshit! I just…
I just want her to show up

582
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,283
when she says she's gonna show up.

583
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,826
Don't worry about Dani.

584
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:41,622
She'll show up. And if she doesn't,
just deal with her when she does.

585
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,375
-Look, Odi is okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

586
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,962
I'm gonna handle dinner.
I just want you to relax. Okay?

587
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:53,676
Hmm! It is such a trip how America
westernizes these international cuisines.

588
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:59,515
When I was in China, there was none of
this sweet and sour and General Tso crap.

589
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,185
Yeah. Sorry to drop the takeout
on you, Farrah. Just short on time.

590
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,312
No, no, no!
Thank you, Kevin. It's wonderful.

591
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:09,024
Interesting. Mmm.

592
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:15,281
So, I, uh, take it you're
still working on that documentary then?

593
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,242
If you're talking about my life's work,

594
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,369
yes, I'm still working
on that documentary.

595
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:21,870
"Life's work?"

596
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,498
How's that going, anyway?

597
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,208
-Ah, it's going wonderfully.
-Hmm.

598
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:27,960
-Joaquin and I--
-Who's Joaquin?

599
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,086
He's my lover.

600
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,257
Right. Is there any more
Szechuan chicken?

601
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,093
Natalie…

602
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,262
If there's something on your mind,

603
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,848
I am opening the door for you
to share it with me.

604
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,183
No, thanks.

605
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,312
I'm allowed to enjoy my life, Natalie.

606
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,522
You know, when I was your age,

607
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,483
I was raising two daughters
and running a home business.

608
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,278
And who funded that business, Mom?
Oh, right, it was dad.

609
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,530
Drinks. Beer? Wine? I'll be right--

610
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,490
Why is it so hard for you to support me?

611
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:01,410
Well, it's hard to support something
that I've never seen!

612
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:05,497
You know, I don't have to subject
myself to this kind of harassment.

613
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:08,292
-Harassment?
-Yes! Harassment!

614
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,544
You're a bully, Natalie.

615
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,964
In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if that's
why your sister decided not to show up!

616
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,632
Uh, I think we all know that's--

617
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:18,510
No, no, no, no! No, Kevin.
It's fine. I'd like to leave now.

618
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,763
Yeah! Kevin, she'd like to leave now.

619
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,348
Tell Joaquin I said hi.

620
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,266
You know what, sweetheart?

621
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,353
This brooding teen act
is a little outdated.

622
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:30,731
Well, so is the whole
free-spirited charade.

623
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,526
You should probably think about taking
"I raised two daughters" off your resume,

624
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,487
because you quit that job a long time ago.

625
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,490
That is so unfair! I sacrificed
everything for you and Dani!

626
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:44,286
Oh, nothing but "I, I, I, I!"
You are such a fucking narcissist!

627
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,996
-I am not!
-You only care about things

628
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,041
that affect you! Honestly, Dani is
probably at her house right now,

629
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,960
relapsing. Shooting up just like she did
the last time you came!

630
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,045
Why would you say that?

631
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:56,090
All because you rip through our lives
like a goddamn cancerous tornado!

632
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,723
Come on! We gotta go! We gotta go!

633
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,433
You're not welcome here!

634
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,602
What the fuck!

635
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,695
Jon Santos, 19.
Katrina Kanter, 16.

636
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:22,032
Trey Mahana, 17.
Any or all of 'em look familiar to you?

637
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,036
No. I've never seen
any of these people in my life.

638
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,124
"Unite the White?"

639
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,209
I don't get it. What is that?

640
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:35,546
One of the kids copied and pasted
this poster onto their Facebook page.

641
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,509
The original source
had your address listed on it.

642
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,345
It calls to recruit
white supremacist members.

643
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,933
You think we did?

644
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,435
I don't know what to think yet.

645
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:52,521
But I do know it's a crazy time,
and anything goes.

646
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,899
How dumb would you have to be
to put your home address on it?

647
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,569
As dumb as you'd have to be
to post it in the first place.

648
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:04,450
Okay. Officer Richardson,
I think what Kevin is trying to say is…

649
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,161
that we would never contribute
to something like this…

650
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,164
ever.

651
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,838
All right.

652
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,968
If that's the case, you should start
thinking about someone you know who would.

653
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,053
We just moved in a couple months ago.

654
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,264
We haven't had time to
meet the people around us.

655
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,558
But what about enemies outside the area?

656
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,268
Anyone who may harbor ill will?

657
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,770
A scorned lover? A vendetta of some kind?

658
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:38,775
No. No. I mean, I'm at work,
school, or home.

659
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,570
I don't have time for interactions
outside of that right now.

660
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:42,988
Mrs. Dadich?

661
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:46,283
Mmm-mmm. No one.

662
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:49,453
Isn't there a way to
trace back who posted this?

663
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,664
Sure. Absolutely.
If, uh, the original hadn't been deleted.

664
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:55,751
So that's it? I mean, what do we do?

665
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,420
They think we're running some
sort of goddamn Nazi operation?

666
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:01,507
-Okay, Kevin--
-They burned the car! Natalie.

667
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,971
Listen, Mr. Dadich,
we are following the trail that we have.

668
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,807
But if there's other information
you have to offer us.

669
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:13,852
Anything out of the ordinary,
disturbances of some kind?

670
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:15,395
That would be very helpful.

671
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,358
No, nothing that immediately
comes to mind.

672
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,611
No.

673
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,029
Right.

674
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,699
Well, if something does.

675
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:38,293
Claudia. Hi. It's Natalie Dadich.

676
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,421
I was just in the neighborhood, and…

677
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,341
these are for you.

678
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,134
Oh! How nice.

679
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,180
All right. Got the ball. Good boy.
Go get it!

680
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,015
Go on! Go get it, Odi!

681
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,143
The ball! Get… get the ball.

682
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:56,645
Fancy meeting you here.

683
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,105
-Hey.

684
00:55:58,522 --> 00:55:59,606
-Here.
-No.

685
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,359
You look tired
and dehydrated. Take it, please?

686
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:05,028
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

687
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,699
Mmm. And thanks for meeting me here today.

688
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:13,829
Between Natalie's family drama,
house, school,

689
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,290
I just needed a normal conversation.

690
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,791
-Happy I can help.
-Mmm.

691
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,295
Your dog sucks at fetch.

692
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,046
Yeah, he does. Horrible.

693
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,091
Here you go.

694
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,553
Obviously what happened
the other night at the house

695
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:34,391
was just people toying with us,
but there's still just some things that…

696
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,228
I don't know,
they're just… different.

697
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:42,274
-You wanna know what happened.
-Yeah.

698
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:47,821
The truth is, I don't know.
Nobody does.

699
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,241
Sure, we know the logistics,
but we don't know why.

700
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:53,952
Jay could be an asshole.

701
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:58,582
He was my older brother, and I love him.

702
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,543
I loved him.

703
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,255
When they were living out of state,

704
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,467
Jay wasn't as faithful to to Erin
as he once promised.

705
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:11,720
As you can imagine,
it didn't go over too well with Erin.

706
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,264
So, she decided to get even.

707
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,267
She had an affair, too?

708
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,771
Some mystery man no one ever heard about.

709
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,899
She never said his name, or who it was.

710
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,944
-So Jay knew about it?
-Eventually.

711
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:31,782
Thing is, all those women that Jay messed
around with, they were more like trophies,

712
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,784
you know. But Erin…

713
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,496
Erin, she had real feelings. Bang him…

714
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:41,541
Well, she said it was a one-time thing,
but that bitch was up to something.

715
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:48,799
Erin designed the house from the ground
up, but Jay paid for everything.

716
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,885
Every single cent, no questions asked.

717
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:56,765
My brother loved that woman to a fault.

718
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,394
They were getting along better, too.

719
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:05,607
I don't understand. If they were doing
so much better, then why…

720
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,487
What is your location?

721
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,447
I'm in my house…

722
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,744
Between you and I…

723
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,455
my brother didn't do it.

724
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,918
Sure, he had a temper,
but he wasn't a murderer.

725
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:27,337
And he certainly wouldn't commit suicide.

726
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:31,675
And what, all of a sudden,
the cameras are all fucked up?

727
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,218
Mmm-mmm.

728
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:37,597
There was a lot of
little details that just didn't add up.

729
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,518
The cops didn't care about any of that.

730
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,896
It's not like it was a white man's murder.

731
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,152
I didn't know we had company.

732
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,574
Oh. Oh, man.

733
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,993
Please tell me you twisted your ankle
playing with my dog

734
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,745
so I can make fun of you forever.

735
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,955
I think it was a bee.
I think a bee got me.

736
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,875
-A bee got you? A bee?
-Yes. Is it bad? Does it look bad?

737
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,377
-Ah, there it is. Hold on. Hold on.
-Ow!

738
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,880
-Got it. Right there.

739
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,173
Oh, it's a big one.

740
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,383
Are you okay, or are we gonna
have to amputate?

741
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,343
Think I'll get a second opinion.

742
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,101
Hey, maybe you should check on Odi.

743
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:28,982
Odi.

744
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,901
Odi, come here, bud.

745
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,195
Odi.

746
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:39,159
-I've never seen him like this.
- I'll get some water.

747
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:42,913
Natalie. Natalie.

748
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,374
Uh, I'm… I'm so sorry for the intrusion.

749
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:50,420
No. No, I… I'm sorry for
making you uncomfortable.

750
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,632
Claudia just springs things on me
sometimes. I just…

751
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,092
She runs her mouth a lot.

752
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,677
Normal husband, wife stuff.
You know how it is.

753
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,055
So you're having some…
some problems with the house?

754
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:04,142
I may have heard a little more
than I was supposed to.

755
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,770
I… I'm sure it's fine.

756
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,815
You know, I think,
given the shock of everything…

757
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,568
Claudia may have acted
a little impulsively.

758
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,238
If you're having trouble with it,

759
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:20,575
I'd be willing to negotiate with you.
Buy the house back.

760
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,578
Not much less than you paid.

761
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,248
Less?

762
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:30,544
Yeah, given the issues,
I'm sure that depreciates the value.

763
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,840
Well, thank you for the offer, but, um…

764
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:38,093
I just don't think we can
take the hit right now.

765
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:40,595
Sorry for the intrusion.

766
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:47,227
You and your husband took advantage
of a woman not in her right mind.

767
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,772
All he left her was that house.

768
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:56,570
And you two swiped it out from under her
like a free meal.

769
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:07,747
Think about what I said.

770
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,005
Kevin.

771
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,383
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, slow down.
What's wrong?

772
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,310
Hi. I'm Avery, Kevin's class partner.

773
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,353
I mentioned that a couple weeks ago.

774
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,940
Right. I must've forgotten.

775
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,817
Well, I'm gonna…

776
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,654
Bye, buddy. Feel better.

777
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:42,824
Nice to meet you.

778
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,826
-See you in class.
-Yeah. Thanks.

779
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:49,873
What?

780
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,959
All right, let's get to it.

781
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:56,713
We ran Odi's blood work.
I'm gonna be honest here.

782
01:01:56,796 --> 01:02:00,342
Between that and his physical,
it doesn't look good.

783
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,845
How not good is it?

784
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:08,183
His blood contains elements of a powerful
toxin causing his health to deteriorate.

785
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,728
It's usually due to something
the dog accidentally ingested.

786
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,981
But the root of it is that
his heart is giving out on him.

787
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,901
Well, is this something that we can treat?

788
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,904
-It'll really just be prolonging the pain.

789
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:25,992
Take the time you need. Talk about it.

790
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,317
How could you not tell me
something like that?

791
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:03,613
I just…

792
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,284
I didn't want it to cause any issues.

793
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:12,038
Well, I'm going to call you out on
your bad judgment there, Nat.

794
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,376
This deal could change everything.

795
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:20,380
I wasn't in a position to turn it down.
I had already signed the paperwork,

796
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,383
but I swear, I had no idea.

797
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,429
Have you been meeting him?

798
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:34,269
It's just work.

799
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,939
Whole goddamn city full of people,
and you have to work with him?

800
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:40,108
Exactly, okay. Have to.

801
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,986
-Look, I don't have a choice.
-Bullshit.

802
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:48,700
You chose your work…

803
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,120
over my feelings, over our marriage.

804
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:56,124
-No, that's not true. It is not like that.
-He's trying to get in your pants.

805
01:03:58,960 --> 01:03:59,878
Oh.

806
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:03,923
Isn't that what you said last time?

807
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,259
Yeah.

808
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:10,722
I remember that pretty fucking clearly.

809
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,527
God damn it, Odi.

810
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:35,372
Kevin.

811
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:37,916
-Kevin.
-What?

812
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:41,878
Someone's at the door.

813
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:46,466
-I don't hear anything.
-Kevin, I swear to God.

814
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,592
Okay, calm down.

815
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,267
Don't move.

816
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:59,729
-What the fuck do we do?
-Get your phone ready to call the cops.

817
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,442
My phone's not here.
Kevin, my fucking phone's not here.

818
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:05,652
Okay. Stay calm.

819
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,782
Kevin. Kevin, don't fucking
leave me up here.

820
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,186
So, after you entered the kitchen,
you didn't hear any other noises?

821
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,147
No open doors, nothing?

822
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,983
And no physical description?

823
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:49,237
There wasn't anyone there to describe.

824
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,781
Hey, I'm just trying to jog your memory.

825
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:00,457
Okay, we'll write up a report.

826
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,462
If anything else comes to mind,
feel free to reach out to me directly.

827
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,047
-There is one other thing.
-Nat.

828
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:11,426
If you could not make me feel
like a lunatic, that would be great.

829
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:16,055
-I've been having these…
-Nightmares.

830
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:25,899
-There is this man. He's rail thin, pale.
-In the home?

831
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,860
Yes. I swear to you, I saw him.

832
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,779
He crawled out into my hallway
and then he attacked me.

833
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:41,206
Right, so you… you had a pale man crawl
into your hallway and attack you?

834
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,292
And you didn't think to report it?

835
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:49,214
No. Because, like Kevin mentioned, at the
time, I thought it was just nightmares.

836
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:54,010
But then things, they started disappearing
and reappearing in other places.

837
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,804
There was this tennis ball
that he put on my bed.

838
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:59,265
Okay, so he put a tennis ball…

839
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,893
on your bed?

840
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:06,147
No, the tennis ball, it was underneath
my bed and I could not reach it.

841
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:10,401
So I went to grab something, and when I
came back, he had put it back on my bed.

842
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,698
Okay. Okay.

843
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,160
Tall, pale man, tennis ball, hallway.

844
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,871
Got it.

845
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:27,585
We'll be in touch.

846
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:33,633
-Oh, we found your phone in the kitchen.
- Thank you.

847
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,809
I hope you know how insane
that made us just seem.

848
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:47,855
Okay, you know what, Kevin,
your wife is sitting with the cops,

849
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:51,192
telling them that she doesn't feel safe,
that I am terrified,

850
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:52,652
and that's your response?

851
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:56,281
Someone just vandalized our house, Kevin.
You don't think it's within the realm

852
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:59,033
of possibility that someone
could be breaking into our house?

853
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:01,244
Not to move tennis balls
and house keys around. No.

854
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:03,037
Well, you know what,
let me remind you

855
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:06,082
that I am not the only one who heard
whatever was in our house tonight,

856
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:08,001
-okay, so--
-What do you want me to do, Nat?

857
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:11,796
I don't know, Kevin. We have a house full
of cameras. Maybe that's a good place…

858
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,881
Do you have any idea
how expensive that would be?

859
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:17,635
My guess would be less than our funerals
whenever someone murders us in our sleep.

860
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:19,512
Okay, pump the brakes on the melodrama.

861
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,806
What we need to be buying is a new car.

862
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,642
To replace the rental that
we're spending a fortune on.

863
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,894
We can't afford this right now.

864
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:33,735
So, uh, once you're logged in,
you'll be able to control the locks

865
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,403
from any room in the house.

866
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:40,617
So, red means locked. Green. Easy as that.

867
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,077
Right now everything's running smoothly.

868
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:45,538
If you start experiencing
some glitching, give us a call.

869
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:49,334
If it's a consistent problem,
we might have to replace the whole system.

870
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:50,835
Excellent.

871
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,144
I asked for a completed sample rack

872
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:12,440
with 15 additional samples
by the time I got back.

873
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,525
-I know.
-And what?

874
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:19,530
It's two weeks later
and I have half that.

875
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:20,740
I know.

876
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:25,119
As a person, I am empathetic to
the shitstorm that is your life right now.

877
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:30,208
But as your boss, I warned you
what you would be getting into.

878
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,461
I don't know what to say.

879
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:37,423
If you had any idea
how embarrassed I am…

880
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:44,430
I'll give you the extension. One week.

881
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,349
-Understood?
-Yes.

882
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:50,603
I need to see the woman who was here
in this office when we first met.

883
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:52,855
That woman had her life together.

884
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,365
I don't know what to tell you, man.
Sounds like you bought a lemon.

885
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,742
You guys saw that house. It's perfect.

886
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,371
-The price we got it for…
-Was apparently way too much.

887
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:11,708
Whatever. Let's just get this cleaned up
before the sun goes down.

888
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:14,001
You know, a similar thing
happened to me once.

889
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:17,714
Met this super cute girl.
Eyes, smile, even had a good personality.

890
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:22,927
So I sleep with her. I wake up
in the morning with chlamydia.

891
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,054
False advertising all around, man.

892
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,347
-What do you mean?
-What?

893
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:28,099
You don't wake up with chlamydia.

894
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,267
That's not the point.

895
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,937
No, it is. If you're going to tell
a story like that, facts actually matter.

896
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:35,273
How do you even know that
she gave you the chlamydia?

897
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:36,441
-Dude.

898
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,860
-Hey.
-Oh.

899
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,488
You're not getting squeamish
on us, are you?

900
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:45,491
Maybe you're not cut out
for this line of work, Princess.

901
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:47,076
-You did this.
-I did it?

902
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,036
Yeah. This is why you can't tell stories.

903
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,581
-Do you need me any help? Okay.
-No.

904
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,166
-Oh, God.

905
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:57,420
I'm working as fast as I can, Nick,
but my mother showed up unexpectedly.

906
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,464
I just had to put my dog down.

907
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:00,840
I know. Um…

908
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:07,096
Look, Anne's breathing down my neck. So,
is there anything I can help you with?

909
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:10,516
No, no, no. I'm fine. I have it, okay?

910
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,435
Did I do something to upset you?

911
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:15,146
I didn't want to bring this up,
especially not right now,

912
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,773
but since we're on the subject of it,

913
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,442
you cannot be sending flowers
to my house, Nick.

914
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:23,446
Okay. Um…
was I supposed to send flowers?

915
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,241
No, the flowers that you sent.
Me and Kevin got in a huge fight--

916
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:30,870
Natalie, wait. I…
I didn't send you any flowers.

917
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:34,665
-Nick, I saw the card. You signed it.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

918
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:37,460
I'm sorry, you said stay away.
And so I did.

919
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:00,358
What the hell?

920
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:03,004
911. What's your emergency?

921
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:07,592
I think that someone is trying to break
into my house. It's 992, Hallow Park Way.

922
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:10,678
-What's your first and last name?
-Natalie Dadich.

923
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:14,098
Please, I need somebody here right now!

924
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:15,975
-Please!
-We have officers dispatched.

925
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,519
I need you to remain calm.
Keep talking on the phone.

926
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:19,729
-Okay?
-Okay.

927
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,189
-How many intruders are there?

928
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:23,691
-I… I don't know.
-Are they armed?

929
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:24,775
I don't know.

930
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:27,403
Ma'am, are you able to get
to a secure location?

931
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:31,157
Are they close?

932
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,160
They're on the way, but
I need you to answer my questions.

933
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,418
Ma'am, can you hear me?

934
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:47,548
Yes. Uh, I'm sorry I…
I made a mistake.

935
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:49,300
So you don't need an officer?

936
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,845
No, I just… I… I'm so sorry.

937
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:56,349
We just had a scare earlier this week,
and I'm really on edge.

938
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,433
Mmm-hmm.

939
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,144
-You be safe, okay?
-Yeah.

940
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

941
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,333
Help.

942
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:42,353
911. What's your emergency?

943
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,271
I… I need someone here right now!

944
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:47,441
It's 992 Hallow Park Way.
There's someone in the house.

945
01:14:47,525 --> 01:14:50,653
We got a call for this number and location
stating no assistance was needed.

946
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,572
I changed my fucking mind!
I need someone here now!

947
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,788
-How many intruders are there?
-I don't know how many.

948
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:03,874
I don't know if they're armed. All I know
is that they're in my house.

949
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:06,127
Are you able to get to a secure location?

950
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:29,900
Hey, Nat?

951
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:47,626
Nat.

952
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:29,168
-How's she doing?

953
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:32,505
She's doing okay. Pretty bruised up.
May have a slight fracture

954
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,219
Did you find him?

955
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,054
Not yet.

956
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,901
We're not sleeping here tonight.

957
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:56,529
The police checked the whole house.

958
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:59,532
I don't care if they sit in their cars
and wait around all night.

959
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,909
I'm not sleeping after what happened.

960
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:08,707
You don't believe me.

961
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,251
I believe you saw something.

962
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:13,963
No. You don't believe that someone
was actually in the house.

963
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:18,175
What about my phone, Kevin? How do you
explain all the pictures on it, huh?

964
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:20,886
Maybe your friend, Nick, took 'em.

965
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:26,767
-Wow, really?
-I said, "Maybe."

966
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:35,317
Look, you said yourself the timestamps
were all from when you were home alone.

967
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,903
-I'm sleeping in a hotel tonight.
-With what money?

968
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:41,448
Our credit cards are maxed out.
The mortgage payment's due next week.

969
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:43,450
Natalie, would you just stop?

970
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,747
If you're seeing him, just tell me.

971
01:17:57,298 --> 01:18:01,135
Mr. Dadich, good to see you again.
Thanks for coming down on short notice.

972
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:05,097
-I'm just looking for some answers.
-Uh, well, I am right there with you.

973
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,435
So we went through your security footage.
Before we take a look,

974
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,688
I just want to go over your wife's
official statement, if that's okay.

975
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:15,316
According to police records,
your wife spots the intruder.

976
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:17,443
She runs upstairs, locks the door,

977
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:21,405
then, somehow, the intruder
ends up in the room with her.

978
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:24,575
She goes to run again,
blocked in by a bookcase,

979
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:29,538
a bookcase, our team concluded, was in
a position inconsistent with her story.

980
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:34,210
Mr. Dadich, to the best
of your recollection,

981
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:37,922
is this account consistent with
what you believe to be true?

982
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,383
-Yeah.
-Okay.

983
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:52,895
At no point does the footage
ever capture another person,

984
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:58,651
not in the living room,
not in the foyer, not on the staircase.

985
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:06,075
Mr. Dadich, no one ever enters
or exits the premises

986
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:09,078
until your wife
throws herself out of the window.

987
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:15,960
- I'm not making this up.
- I never said that.

988
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:17,920
It's called fucking subtext, Kevin.

989
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:20,631
Why else would you ask me
to go back on my medication?

990
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,841
All right, let's just take a moment.

991
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:29,556
Natalie, I'd like to be clear
that no one in this room

992
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,393
is suggesting
that you're fabricating anything.

993
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:38,232
Believe me, okay? I know how this sounds,
but I know what I saw. I'm not delusional.

994
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:42,027
-We never should've moved into that house.
-But we did. So--

995
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:43,362
So we sell it.

996
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,198
After all the attention
you've drawn to it?

997
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:48,867
We. I meant, "we've drawn to it."

998
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:52,204
Yes, we can sell it back
to Claudia and her husband, okay?

999
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:53,664
I spoke with Robert, and he--

1000
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:56,417
Wait, you spoke to Robert? When?

1001
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,295
When when I went to go ask Claudia
for some history on the house.

1002
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:01,088
-Oh, my God.
-Look, it was a valid concern.

1003
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:02,506
Why would you bother them

1004
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:04,842
about being haunted
by who the fuck knows what

1005
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,802
in a place where
their family was murdered?

1006
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:09,263
I don't know, Kevin.
Why are you so concerned

1007
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:12,141
with everyone else's feelings but mine?

1008
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:23,569
I don't understand how I'm the bad guy
when all I'm doing is looking out for us.

1009
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,654
You don't have any boundaries.
That's your problem.

1010
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,032
You do whatever you want.
You don't care how people feel.

1011
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:31,160
Oh, well, what about how I feel, Kevin?

1012
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:35,456
You have never sounded
more like your mother, you know that?

1013
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:40,044
You're such a fucking asshole. Why
would you even say something like that?

1014
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:44,465
Oh, yeah, that's great. Just go ahead
and walk away like you always do

1015
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:47,843
-because you're a fucking coward.

1016
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:51,138
-Kevin, what are you doing?

1017
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:52,473
-Kevin!

1018
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:56,226
Oh, my God. Someone help!
Someone call 911!

1019
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:59,563
Baby, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

1020
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,523
Someone call 911!

1021
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:06,737
Mrs. Dadich.

1022
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:08,739
He is coherent,
and there are no indications

1023
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:11,533
of any memory loss
or other physical trauma.

1024
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:16,330
-Okay. So, what happened?
-Uh, why don't you have a seat? Please.

1025
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,421
Are you aware of something called Nerium?

1026
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:29,385
-No.
-It's a lethal poisoning agent.

1027
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:32,096
And the reason I ask
is because we found traces of it

1028
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:33,680
in your husband's bloodstream.

1029
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:37,309
Now, taken in small doses
over a prolonged period of time,

1030
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:42,147
it can lead to health deteriorations,
ranging from vomiting or muscle weakness

1031
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:48,153
to seizures or arrhythmic heart function,
sometimes mistaken as cardiac arrest.

1032
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:51,490
You have any idea
how that got into his blood?

1033
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:56,703
I wanna see Kevin.

1034
01:21:56,787 --> 01:21:58,622
-I can't let that--
-It's my husband.

1035
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:01,750
-What do you mean you can't allow me to--
-I understand that, Mrs. Dadich.

1036
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:05,504
But he's with the authorities right now.
So, why don't you just have a seat?

1037
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:09,425
No, I am
on your side, Natalie.

1038
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:11,176
Well, it doesn't feel like it.

1039
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,011
But I'm just trying to understand.

1040
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:15,055
According to
Mr. Dadich's hospital records,

1041
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:17,724
he's been exposed to this substance
for quite some time now.

1042
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:19,935
What? Why would I try
and kill my husband

1043
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:22,771
after working so hard
to rebuild our marriage?

1044
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:25,232
Oh, maybe because this Nick Scott guy
comes back into town.

1045
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:26,150
Oh, my God.

1046
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:28,110
You decide you wanna have a life with him.

1047
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,155
Young, stable, handsome.
Also, he's kick-starting your career.

1048
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:33,949
-I love my husband.
-Maybe a chemical imbalance in the brain.

1049
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:35,909
There's footage of you running around
the house

1050
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,704
-from an invisible intruder.
-There was someone in my house!

1051
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,956
Maybe because you just realized…

1052
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:43,876
your husband is
never going to forgive you.

1053
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:52,968
Oh, is this you
ending our conversation?

1054
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:56,430
Well, if I'm not under arrest,
I'd like to get back to work now.

1055
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,099
By all means.

1056
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:24,291
-How're you feeling?
-Better than yesterday, I guess.

1057
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:28,754
Uh, hey, I was gonna
make us dinner tonight.

1058
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:32,257
Is there anything you want to request?

1059
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:34,801
You know, I've got to work
on the project again.

1060
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:37,846
-With Avery?
-Yeah.

1061
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:41,266
Are you sure that you should be
pushing yourself like that?

1062
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,976
You just got out of the hospital.

1063
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:46,146
It's half our grade.
I don't really know that we have a choice.

1064
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:53,612
Plus, we're running behind. I don't wanna
make her lift all the dead weight.

1065
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,742
You don't wanna take your lunch?

1066
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,745
No, I'm not feeling up to a whole meal.

1067
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,331
Start light.

1068
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:08,085
-Bye, Nat.
-Bye.

1069
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,476
Hi. Can I help you?

1070
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:31,191
Sor… Sorry, uh…
You're just such a beautiful woman.

1071
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:33,735
I think you have the wrong house.

1072
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:40,659
Oh… you really just like to
get right into things, huh?

1073
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:43,704
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1074
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:46,248
-Hey, what are you doing?

1075
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,836
Chica, you really do
like to put up a fight.

1076
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,672
- Come here.

1077
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,716
-Come here. Hey, hey!

1078
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:57,884
I was just kinda hoping
you'd be wearing a dress,

1079
01:24:57,968 --> 01:25:00,929
make this a little easier
on me, huh?

1080
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:05,767
Jesus Christ, lady!
What the f…

1081
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:11,982
-Don't fight. It's a mistake…

1082
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:34,838
Got some good news for you.
We were able to ID your attacker.

1083
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:36,715
Travis Murray.

1084
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:40,469
Your camera caught him canvassing
the house just before the attack.

1085
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:43,096
We have reason to believe
he's been watching your house

1086
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,432
-for quite some time now.
-So what do we do now?

1087
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:47,643
We get a lawyer, press charges?

1088
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:50,395
Uh, well, not exactly.

1089
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:53,065
We aren't actually able
to place him under arrest.

1090
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,317
- What?
-There is an investigation

1091
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,362
that has dug up some information
relieving Travis of all charges.

1092
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:00,447
What do you mean? He broke into our house.

1093
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:03,825
Robert Sorrentino, the man who sold you
the house in which you currently reside.

1094
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,287
-What does he have to do with anything?
-Sorrentino has been taken into custody

1095
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:10,457
just a couple of hours ago.
He admitted to his involvement.

1096
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:13,877
What are you saying? He sent
some stranger to our house to attack her?

1097
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:18,799
Our detectives found an online post
in Travis Murray's search history.

1098
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:22,969
It disclosed
Mrs. Dadich's name

1099
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:26,765
in addition to a photograph
pulled from an online source.

1100
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:29,476
"I prefer to be taken by surprise?"

1101
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:33,814
Yeah. It was an ad
listed under the personals

1102
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:38,694
and intended to portray Mrs. Dadich
as a lonely, unsatisfied housewife

1103
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:42,823
with a fetish for spontaneous,
submissive sex, preferably with strangers.

1104
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:48,495
Luckily, our detectives were able to trace
the IP address directly to Robert.

1105
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:52,290
Robert also admitted to posting
the initial listing

1106
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:54,543
that provoked the vandalism to your house

1107
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:56,920
as well as purchasing
the magazine subscriptions.

1108
01:26:57,003 --> 01:27:00,132
Mr. Sorrentino claims
he wasn't trying to inflict harm,

1109
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:04,010
just trying to scare you all,
hoping you'd forfeit the purchase.

1110
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:08,515
He nearly had my wife raped and beaten.

1111
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:12,519
She is so traumatized
she can't sleep in our house.

1112
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:16,648
He poisoned my dog to death and tried
to do the same fucking thing to me!

1113
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:18,734
Hey, well, hold on.
Hold on, Mr. Dadich.

1114
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:23,405
As of now, Mr. Sorrentino denies
ever personally entering the property.

1115
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:26,700
He says he has no knowledge
of the other attacks against your wife

1116
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:29,745
-and has never been exposed to the Nerium.
-No shit.

1117
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:31,788
Of course, he'd fucking deny it.

1118
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:35,208
Fraud is one thing, but attempted murder?
You're just gonna sit on this shit?

1119
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:39,504
Hey, listen, we have our men working
around the clock to get a confession.

1120
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:43,592
We're still holding him on the charges
he's taken responsibility for.

1121
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,510
I thought you said
there's some good news.

1122
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,220
Well, there is.

1123
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:49,765
Upon questioning him,
we now have reason to believe

1124
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:54,311
he has a certain level of involvement
with the death of the previous homeowners.

1125
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:56,897
-How so?
-Well, unbeknownst to Mrs. Sorrentino,

1126
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:59,524
Robert had accumulated
a significant amount of debt.

1127
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:03,403
Your house, knowingly left to him
by his brother-in-law…

1128
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:06,114
was the only financial venture
he had going.

1129
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,579
I should've listened to you.

1130
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:15,457
I'm sorry

1131
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:30,222
I was just tricking myself
into believing that

1132
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:34,100
if I just waited it out,
you'd come around.

1133
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:42,067
But you and I both know that you're never
really gonna trust me again…

1134
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:45,445
not 100%.

1135
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:57,374
I think that we should
talk about separating…

1136
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,504
at least for a little while.

1137
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:49,926
Hmm.

1138
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:56,850
This is half your grade.
Don't mess around.

1139
01:29:56,933 --> 01:30:00,729
Check in with each other. Check in
with me. I'm here after class.

1140
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:03,732
Some of you already know that.

1141
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:20,350
How much did you
pay for those shoes?

1142
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:22,727
- Oh, you don't wanna know.
-I don't wanna know?

1143
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:26,189
-'Cause they look just like--
- Kind of obscene, to be honest.

1144
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:32,654
-You should answer the phone.

1145
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,991
I mean, what's the point?

1146
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:40,120
She made it very clear that
she doesn't want me to come home.

1147
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:42,330
She's your wife.

1148
01:31:43,123 --> 01:31:44,791
You should answer the phone.

1149
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:52,173
-Hey, it's me.

1150
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:54,551
Um…

1151
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:58,012
I don't even know where to start.

1152
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:03,059
I'm sorry for what I said last night.

1153
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:05,729
I didn't mean it.

1154
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,899
I, uh, assume that
you're still at work, but

1155
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:13,153
if you come home soon, I'd really
love to spend some time with you.

1156
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:16,740
I love you. I'll be up. Call me.

1157
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:26,875
I don't get it.

1158
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:29,377
That's the thing about people.

1159
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:32,672
They change their minds…

1160
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:36,217
a lot, actually.

1161
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:43,641
You know, um, we could just
pick this up tomorrow.

1162
01:32:44,768 --> 01:32:46,060
Kevin.

1163
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:49,355
Go home.

1164
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,257
Jesus Christ, Natalie.

1165
01:33:17,133 --> 01:33:19,052
Get it together.

1166
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:35,360
I hate this fucking house.

1167
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:42,826
-Hello?
- Hey, how's it going?

1168
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:44,953
Fine.

1169
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:48,540
-I'm on my way home now.
-Where have you been?

1170
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:53,419
-You told me not to come home. So…
-When?

1171
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,340
When you texted me.

1172
01:33:58,007 --> 01:34:00,260
Kevin, I didn't text you anything.

1173
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,888
I am looking at
my text messages right now.

1174
01:34:04,722 --> 01:34:07,100
I… I can screenshot you my thread
if you want.

1175
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1176
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,267
Hey, how much for the flowers?

1177
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:15,812
- $8.95.
- They're fresh, right?

1178
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:16,938
Absolutely.

1179
01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:18,356
Uh-huh.

1180
01:37:16,289 --> 01:37:17,165
My brother?

1181
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,960
Yeah, he had a temper,
but he wasn't a murderer.

1182
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:24,088
- She had an affair, too?
- Mmm-hmm.

1183
01:37:24,172 --> 01:37:26,549
Some mystery man no one ever heard about.

1184
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:29,927
Erin designed the house
from the ground up.

1185
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:32,889
That bitch was up to something.

1186
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:11,946
Who are you?

1187
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:22,331
The photos…

1188
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:25,001
Is that you?

1189
01:39:36,512 --> 01:39:40,266
No, no, no, no! Please, please, please!
I won't scream, I promise!

1190
01:39:42,435 --> 01:39:44,770
I just want to talk to you, okay?

1191
01:39:57,283 --> 01:39:59,202
She brought you here, didn't she?

1192
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:04,207
Erin?

1193
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:09,086
She wanted you to be here with her.

1194
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:13,925
And you loved her.

1195
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:20,056
After everything that you gave up…

1196
01:40:22,892 --> 01:40:25,228
she still chose him, didn't she?

1197
01:40:44,121 --> 01:40:47,375
I think it's horrible
that she kept you here.

1198
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:54,674
You didn't deserve that.

1199
01:40:57,134 --> 01:40:58,344
You didn't.

1200
01:42:01,324 --> 01:42:02,158
No, no, no…

1201
01:42:16,172 --> 01:42:17,882
No, no, no, no!
Please, wait, wait, wait!

1202
01:42:17,965 --> 01:42:19,342
Let me help you! I wanna help you.

1203
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,885
Kill him.

1204
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:26,724
Yeah. I'll help you cover it,
and then we can stay here together.

1205
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:33,105
He doesn't love me anymore.

1206
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:41,364
I'm so tired of being alone.

1207
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:51,058
A little overboard
on the steam, Nat.

1208
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:10,286
Ah, it's the romantic effort
that counts, I guess.

1209
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:27,178
There you are.

1210
01:44:27,428 --> 01:44:30,890
I like the sexy scavenger hunt thing.
The bathroom took a hit, though.

1211
01:44:41,942 --> 01:44:45,237
Hey, are you asleep?

1212
01:44:58,167 --> 01:44:59,668
You're so wet.

1213
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:18,270
Kevin!

1214
01:48:07,189 --> 01:48:09,191
I'm so sorry.

1215
01:48:09,274 --> 01:48:11,652
I love you so much. I'm so sorry.

1216
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:15,572
It's okay. Come on. Let's go. You're okay.

1217
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:20,596
Thank God!

1218
01:49:22,264 --> 01:49:24,892
-Hey.
-Jesus Christ!

1219
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:25,976
Okay!

1220
01:49:26,059 --> 01:49:27,352
You cannot scare me like that.

1221
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:30,731
Okay, in my defense, I thought
I'd just come through the front door.

1222
01:49:30,814 --> 01:49:33,275
Can you just help me
get this stuff the hell out of here?

1223
01:49:33,358 --> 01:49:36,320
You're doing such a good job
that I don't wanna mess it up.

1224
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:38,906
-I still have a knife in my hand.
-Uh-huh.

1225
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:44,203
Why are you looking at me like that?

1226
01:49:44,828 --> 01:49:46,747
You just look good.

1227
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:52,044
How do I look?

1228
01:49:52,127 --> 01:49:54,463
Okay, and that moment is ruined.

1229
01:49:54,546 --> 01:49:57,424
Oh, I thought I made it better.
I should take that.

1230
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:01,136
-And, uh, hey, thanks for the gift.
-Mmm-hmm.

1231
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:04,515
I wasn't gonna keep it, so…

1232
01:50:04,598 --> 01:50:08,185
Hey, guys. I checked all the rooms.
Everything's all clear.

1233
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:10,187
Unless you wanna send Dave back in there,

1234
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:12,147
and I honestly wouldn't care
if he came back.

1235
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:14,608
-That's fine.
-I heard that, Garrett.

1236
01:50:15,317 --> 01:50:16,902
-That mustache has changed you.
-I know.

1237
01:50:16,985 --> 01:50:18,529
-Um, last box?
-Yeah.

1238
01:50:18,612 --> 01:50:20,739
-All right, let's do this.
-Oh, my God.

1239
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:23,617
-You ready?
-Yeah.

1240
01:50:23,742 --> 01:50:25,118
Come here, bud.

1241
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:32,209
Should we all wave goodbye to the house?

1242
01:50:32,292 --> 01:50:33,335
Absolutely.

1243
01:50:36,129 --> 01:50:37,339
Bye, house.

1244
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:41,218
- They almost died.
- Yeah.
