1
00:01:10,962 --> 00:01:14,382
<i>So, it's becoming more apparent</i>

2
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:16,843
<i>that not only is Gabriel
getting stronger,</i>

3
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:18,928
<i>he's becoming more malicious.</i>

4
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,931
<i>If his strength and ability
continue to grow at this rate,</i>

5
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:25,101
<i>we will no longer
be able to contain him.</i>

6
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:27,687
<i>However, I am
still determined...</i>

7
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,484
<i> Dr. Weaver,</i>
<i>he got out again.</i>

8
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,863
How far did he get this time?

9
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:38,406
He made it all the way
to the records room

10
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:39,449
before we got to him.
He found his information.

11
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,742
He wants to go home.

12
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:43,828
Dr. Fields, what the hell
is happening?

13
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:45,204
I tried to subdue him with ECT,

14
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:46,831
but electroshock
had no effect on him.

15
00:01:46,915 --> 00:01:48,791
Then all the machines
started going crazy.

16
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,336
It was like he was
drinking the electricity

17
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:53,504
and controlling our machines.

18
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,593
Dr. Plume.

19
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:08,227
No, please, don't.
He'll kill you.

20
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:09,604
Stand aside.

21
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,399
Take him down now.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

23
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,745
Strap him into the chair.

24
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:32,895
You've been a bad,
bad boy, Gabriel.

25
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,076
<i>I will kill you all.</i>

26
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,913
Oh, my God. He speaks.

27
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,458
He's broadcasting his thoughts.

28
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,922
I thought we could help him,
but I was wrong.

29
00:04:04,302 --> 00:04:06,262
It's time

30
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,475
we cut out the cancer.

31
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:06,442
<i> Frankie is trying</i>
<i>to get to Chavez.</i>

32
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:08,736
<i>He's trying to get his arms up
to protect himself,</i>

33
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,738
<i>but he can't get any leverage.</i>

34
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:14,116
Hey, sugar, I thought
you were on the late shift.

35
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:20,581
I was, but dumpling's been
giving me a really hard time.

36
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,758
What do you mean, "a hard time"?

37
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,134
I don't know.

38
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,513
She's just a little more
agitated than usual.

39
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:37,473
Do we have any Tylenol?

40
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,433
They say I can't take aspirin.

41
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,939
You know, if you've
got all this pain,

42
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:46,816
maybe you shouldn't
be going to work.

43
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,819
I'll be fine.
I promise.

44
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,490
Hey, I was watching that.

45
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:58,035
Please, Derek, I really
need to get some rest.

46
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,830
No, maybe you need
to stop getting pregnant.

47
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,708
Derek, please. I just
really need to lie down.

48
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:04,834
You know the doctor said

49
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,877
this could happen again, right?

50
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:08,546
You know that.

51
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:09,839
How many times
do I have to watch

52
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,257
my children die inside of you?

53
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,342
Just stop.

54
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,304
You're breaking my heart,
Maddy. I swear to God.

55
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,642
You can't keep doing this.

56
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:30,359
Doing what?

57
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:35,573
Doing what, Madison?
Tell me what I'm doing, huh?

58
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:36,699
Tell me what I'm doing.

59
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,242
Are you saying this is my fault?

60
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:39,619
Are you saying this keeps
happening because of...

61
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:40,995
Don't touch her!

62
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:43,831
You bitch!

63
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:46,375
Oh, shit.

64
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,210
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

65
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,213
I'm gonna get you
some ice, okay?

66
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,090
Okay, I'm gonna get
you some ice. Hold on.

67
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:57,988
Babe,

68
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:01,450
I'm sorry that happened,
that, uh...

69
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,121
Sometimes it's like
I can't control myself, okay?

70
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,581
But that's not me, that...

71
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:11,544
You know, I'm trying,
and I've given up drinking,

72
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:14,046
and I'm gonna continue
to do better

73
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,466
for you and the baby, okay?

74
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,096
Maddy? Please.

75
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,057
It was an accident, Maddy.

76
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,109
Maddy?

77
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

78
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,425
What?

79
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:36,146
Madison?

80
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:47,533
<i> It cannot be!</i>

81
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:49,118
<i> ...grabbed</i>
<i>a steel blade.</i>

82
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,202
<i> ...has possession</i>
<i>of the puck down...</i>

83
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:53,122
<i> ...just now</i>
<i>crossed paths out of...</i>

84
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:57,710
<i>Help me.</i>

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

86
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

87
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:36,183
Derek?

88
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

89
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

90
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:03,312
Morning, Reg.

91
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:06,940
Morning? It's 4 a.m.
Night's not even over yet.

92
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:08,192
- Detectives.
- Officer Lee,

93
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:09,318
what happened here?

94
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,569
Home invasion.

95
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:12,321
Neighbors heard screaming
and called it in.

96
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:16,742
Any sign
of forced entry?

97
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,035
Not that we've seen.

98
00:16:20,537 --> 00:16:21,997
- Where's the wife?
- Already at the hospital.

99
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,416
We found her unconscious
in the nursery.

100
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,376
Uh-oh, here comes
Miss Lonely-heart.

101
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:30,255
- Hey, Kekoa.
- Winnie, how bad is it?

102
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:31,965
I've never seen anything
quite like it.

103
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:34,885
Maybe from a vehicular
accident, but not this.

104
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:36,553
This is something special.

105
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:43,227
Holy shit.

106
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:57,449
Sydney?

107
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,204
Hi. Hi.

108
00:17:04,331 --> 00:17:07,417
Where am I?
What... What happened?

109
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:09,586
It's okay.
You're in a hospital.

110
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,213
Where's Derek?

111
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:15,300
Do you remember what happened?
Someone broke into your house.

112
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,389
You were attacked, and Derek...

113
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,932
I was...

114
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,352
- Just... Just rest.
- I was...

115
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:27,855
I was so scared.

116
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,984
Scared for my baby.

117
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:41,285
Where is she?

118
00:17:43,871 --> 00:17:46,540
Where is she, Syd?
Where is she?

119
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:52,170
I'm so sorry, Maddy.
They couldn't save her.

120
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,509
No.

121
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:02,931
No, no, no. No. No.

122
00:18:08,937 --> 00:18:10,063
It's okay.

123
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:13,025
No! Please, no.

124
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:15,444
No!

125
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,112
Hey, okay.

126
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:18,655
No!

127
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,542
Mrs. Mitchell?

128
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:34,504
Mrs. Mitchell,
I'm Detective Kekoa Shaw.

129
00:18:35,672 --> 00:18:36,798
I'm sorry to bother you,

130
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,092
but I need to ask you
a few questions.

131
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:41,386
Mrs. Mitchell?

132
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,807
Can I help you
with something?

133
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,810
Uh, I'm Detective Kekoa Shaw.

134
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,147
Oh, I'm Sydney Lake.
I'm Madison's sister.

135
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,650
So, can I help you?

136
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,278
Oh, this.

137
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:03,909
Um, I'm a...
a princess at Family Planet.

138
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,327
So, I'm on my lunch break,

139
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,163
and I thought I'd come by
and check on Maddy.

140
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:11,875
She's been like this
for two days.

141
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,752
I can't even get her to eat.

142
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:15,253
Well, maybe
you can help me then.

143
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:16,630
Did you know of anyone
who wanted

144
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:18,507
to hurt your sister
or her husband?

145
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,175
There's no sign
of forced entry at the house.

146
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:21,468
May have been
somebody they knew.

147
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:23,011
Somebody with access.

148
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,473
I wouldn't know.
Derek kept us apart.

149
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,893
This isn't her first, right?

150
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:31,353
The doctor said your sister

151
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,605
had three miscarriages
in the last two years.

152
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,525
Oh, my God.

153
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:40,404
Um, I didn't know.

154
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:44,199
I don't know why
she wouldn't have told me.

155
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:48,662
Maddy...

156
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,213
If there's anything,
just give me a call.

157
00:19:58,296 --> 00:19:59,339
Yeah. Thank you.

158
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:13,478
Keh,
you'll get a kick out of this.

159
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:16,898
No fingerprints, but all the
hand patterns are upside down.

160
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,234
Like our perp was hanging
from the ceiling.

161
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:21,111
That line up with anything
from forensics?

162
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:24,031
No footprints on the ceiling,
if that's what you mean.

163
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:26,867
But I spoke to the neighbors,
and more than one of them said

164
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:30,871
that Mr. Mitchell used to
knock Mrs. Mitchell around.

165
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:33,081
He beat her?

166
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,918
No forced entry,
an abusive husband.

167
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,712
Motive.

168
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,228
Please let me stay
with you for a few days.

169
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:58,690
I can blow off work,
and a few auditions.

170
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:01,568
It's not like I'm booking
anything anyway.

171
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:08,658
It felt so real this time.

172
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,623
I just...

173
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,753
I just couldn't do enough
to protect her.

174
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:28,804
You don't have to
stay here, you know.

175
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,556
I know,
but this is my home,

176
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,768
and I'm not gonna let it be
taken away from me too.

177
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:38,688
I'll be fine, I promise.

178
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:24,646
There's nobody there.

179
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,439
There's no one there.

180
00:24:26,523 --> 00:24:29,150
It's all in my head.
It's all in my head.

181
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,695
There's no one there.
It's all in my...

182
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,447
It's all in my head.

183
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,502
Oh, my God.

184
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:13,755
Hey, are you gonna let me in?

185
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,466
Jesus, Sydney,
what are you doing?

186
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:20,261
Okay. My key wasn't
working and you weren't...

187
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,262
Oh, God.

188
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,722
You weren't answering.

189
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,643
I thought something was wrong,
I was worried.

190
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:30,063
Thanks.

191
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, I, um, installed deadbolts.
That makes so much sense.

192
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:43,618
Well, okay.

193
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:45,245
Mom made a casserole.

194
00:26:45,328 --> 00:26:48,581
I could not climb with it,
so it is outside, but,

195
00:26:48,665 --> 00:26:49,833
um...

196
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:52,419
You okay?

197
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:55,713
Derek did that.

198
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,300
He smashed my head
against the wall.

199
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,510
What?

200
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,222
I'm so sorry, Maddy.

201
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:06,724
Nobody deserves to die that way,

202
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:09,811
but seriously, fuck him.

203
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:13,314
You deserve so much better.

204
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,152
I thought about it a lot,
about leaving him.

205
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:21,239
By the time I got the courage,
I got pregnant.

206
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:27,328
Now, if only I'd been able
to have a baby.

207
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,998
Don't do that.
This is not your fault.

208
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,624
That's not what I'm saying.

209
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,838
I wanted to know
what it felt like

210
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,841
to have a blood connection
with someone.

211
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:43,136
A biological connection.

212
00:27:44,304 --> 00:27:46,347
Maddy, what are
you talking about?

213
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:49,809
Shit.

214
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,818
Mom and Dad took me in
when I was eight.

215
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,156
I don't remember
anything before that.

216
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:07,118
Mom told me that my biological
mother died during my birth.

217
00:28:08,495 --> 00:28:09,871
Sydney, I'm adopted.

218
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,767
Welcome to
the Seattle Underground.

219
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,852
No, folks, this is not
a historical tour

220
00:28:32,936 --> 00:28:35,230
of Nirvana or Pearl Jam.

221
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,190
This is a tour of old Seattle,

222
00:28:37,273 --> 00:28:38,399
buried underneath here

223
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,527
like a time capsule
of a bygone era.

224
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,153
All this used to be
at street level

225
00:28:42,237 --> 00:28:43,738
where the people worked
and lived.

226
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:46,491
But after the great fire
of 1889,

227
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,785
they decided to rebuild
the new city

228
00:28:48,868 --> 00:28:50,245
on top of the old city.

229
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:53,248
One story higher
to stave off flooding.

230
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,250
You can still see
the cobblestone streets

231
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,669
and the storefronts down here.

232
00:28:57,752 --> 00:29:01,339
And there are rumors of
passages stretching for miles.

233
00:29:01,422 --> 00:29:03,258
Some say the ghosts of the past

234
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:04,842
still haunt these tunnels.

235
00:29:10,723 --> 00:29:13,268
Ooh.

236
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:15,270
Thank you.

237
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,107
Thank you. Have a good night.

238
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:56,519
We're closed.

239
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,115
You can't be down here.

240
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,459

Hello?

- <i> Dr. Weaver.</i>
- Yes?

<i> It's time</i>
<i>to cut out the cancer.</i>

252
00:33:01,662 --> 00:33:02,747
What?

253
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,210
Hello?
I'm sorry, who is this?

254
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:09,837
Hello?

Shit.

256
00:35:58,005 --> 00:35:59,757
What are you doing in my house?

257
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,384
This is my house!

258
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:03,094
Who are you?

259
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:12,853
I can't move.
What's happening?

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
What do you want? Who are you?

261
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,999
No! No!

00:37:02,111 --> 00:37:08,159
<i>Time to cut out the cancer.</i>

263
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:11,746
Oh, God.
No. It's not possible.

264
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,001
No.

265
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:52,703
Oh, God.

266
00:37:56,665 --> 00:37:58,793
What do you want from me?

267
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:03,631
<i> To show you</i>
<i>what the cancer has become.</i>

268
00:38:33,285 --> 00:38:34,662
Hey.

269
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,832
So, housekeeper found our vic.
Dr. Florence Weaver.

270
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,793
Tough old bird,
but she fought until the end.

271
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:50,511
What you got, Winnie?

272
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,221
He killed her
with one of her trophies.

273
00:38:52,304 --> 00:38:54,390
We just got the base.
The top half is missing.

274
00:38:54,473 --> 00:38:57,184
The brutality seems consistent
with our other corpse.

275
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:00,563
- Same guy?
- That would be my bet.

276
00:39:00,646 --> 00:39:02,690
We need to find
that missing half.

277
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,109
Yeah, don't we all.

278
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:15,077
What you got?

279
00:39:17,663 --> 00:39:21,125
Dr. Weaver specialized in
child reconstructive surgery.

280
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:23,919
She kept journals
on all her patients.

281
00:39:25,588 --> 00:39:26,547
Bag all these books.

282
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,715
I want them back
at the precinct.

283
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,049
Yes, sir.

284
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,885
What, are you gonna
go through all of them?

285
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,053
We're gonna go through
all of them.

286
00:39:35,014 --> 00:39:38,684
Hey, did you find the rest
of that murder weapon yet?

<i>at approximately
8:30 this morning.</i>

295
00:40:53,175 --> 00:40:54,802
Did you know her?

296
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000

No. No.
But I saw her die.
I don't know how.

297
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,188
I was doing laundry and...

298
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:10,067
and I saw him killing her.

299
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,653
It was him. It was him.

300
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,572
Him? Him, like the guy
that attacked you?

301
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:16,657
Yes.

302
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,325
He was here in the...

303
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,827
No, no.

304
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:23,622
I saw him murdering her
in her house.

305
00:41:23,706 --> 00:41:28,002
And it was like I was there
and here at the same time.

306
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:31,338
It was... It was...
What is happening to me, Syd?

307
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,548
Okay, okay.

308
00:41:34,842 --> 00:41:37,720
It'll be okay. We're gonna
figure it out, okay?

309
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:47,229
Ooh.

310
00:41:47,313 --> 00:41:49,189
That's it. I'm out.

311
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,108
I read about one more sick kid,

312
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:53,736
my brain's gonna
push out my eyeballs.

313
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:55,863
- Good night.
- Tell Marcus it's my fault.

314
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,114
I'll make up for date night.

315
00:41:57,197 --> 00:41:58,782
You better.
He's pissed.

316
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,119
Jesus.

317
00:42:05,748 --> 00:42:09,001
- Yo, Basco, you here?
- No.

318
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:15,591
I thought I was the only

319
00:42:15,674 --> 00:42:17,217
good-looking guy here
working late.

320
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:21,764
Got this case. Strange one.
Can you age that up?

321
00:42:22,848 --> 00:42:24,350
How old do you need?

322
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,894
30 years.

323
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,409
I know, I know.

324
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,244
But who would kill her, John?

325
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,955
Let alone mutilate her
like that?

326
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,585
I know, I haven't spoken
with her in years,

327
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:56,632
but the person I knew, all she
ever did was help people.

328
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,055
Don't bring up Simion.

329
00:43:03,138 --> 00:43:04,473
That was a different time.

What's wrong? What's wrong?

335
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:20,020
- He's here. He's here.
- Who? Who?

336
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,358
There's no one here.

337
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,942
Look at me, there's no one here.

338
00:47:26,026 --> 00:47:28,403
You were just dreaming.
Come here.

339
00:47:28,487 --> 00:47:30,530
Shit, Maddy, you're bleeding.

340
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,492
I wasn't dreaming.

341
00:47:33,575 --> 00:47:36,870
I saw him. I saw him.

342
00:47:36,953 --> 00:47:40,540
He killed again,
but this time I saw his face.

343
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:43,293
I saw... I saw his face.

344
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,466
Somehow
I'm seeing his murders,

345
00:47:49,549 --> 00:47:50,967
like he's showing them to me.

346
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:52,636
What do you mean?
He's sending you videos?

347
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:57,224
No, goddamn it. I see them
as they're happening.

348
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,893
Like I'm having visions.
I know how that sounds.

349
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:04,022
Okay, maybe, when the killer
attacked Madison,

350
00:48:04,106 --> 00:48:08,068
they formed,
like, some kind of, um,

351
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,904
like a... a psychic bond.

352
00:48:10,987 --> 00:48:12,823
I mean, you guys
consult psychics for, like,

353
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:15,283
missing persons cases, right?

354
00:48:15,367 --> 00:48:16,910
No, we don't.

355
00:48:16,993 --> 00:48:19,121
I played a psychic
in an episode of a cop show,

356
00:48:19,204 --> 00:48:21,915
and they said it's a real thing.

357
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:23,667
Are we really having
this conversation?

358
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:29,881
Okay, Madison,
what exactly did you see?

359
00:48:29,965 --> 00:48:31,967
He killed again.

360
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,469
This time, across from
the Silvercup apartments

361
00:48:34,553 --> 00:48:35,804
in North Beacon Hill.

362
00:48:35,887 --> 00:48:37,764
- I Googled it.
- Great.

363
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,600
Wikipedia Brown here
just solved the case.

364
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:44,354
Listen, Madison saw
Dr. Weaver die as it happened,

365
00:48:44,438 --> 00:48:47,065
and now she says she's seen
this one, so let's go look.

366
00:48:47,149 --> 00:48:48,775
If she's wrong, you can
have her committed,

367
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:50,360
and you can put the cuffs on me.

368
00:49:10,172 --> 00:49:11,757
There it is. Silvercup.

369
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:16,762
I think it's this one.

370
00:49:17,804 --> 00:49:19,181
Which one?

371
00:49:19,264 --> 00:49:21,892
So what, are we gonna knock
on every door now?

372
00:49:21,975 --> 00:49:23,477
It's the top floor.

373
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,478
We could help.

374
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,521
Yeah, we don't need your help.

375
00:49:26,605 --> 00:49:28,482
Could you keep an eye
on these two?

376
00:49:32,652 --> 00:49:34,237
Come on, Keh.

377
00:49:39,284 --> 00:49:40,911
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

378
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:44,956
What?

379
00:49:45,957 --> 00:49:47,334
I see you.

380
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:50,754
What? They gave us a lead.

381
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:52,756
Cute little actress
throw you a ball,

382
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:54,341
and you gone chasing like a dog.

383
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,092
- What was that?
- Nothing.

384
00:50:06,561 --> 00:50:10,565
Hello? Anybody home?
This is the police.

385
00:50:10,649 --> 00:50:13,109
If anybody's here,
you need to let us know.

386
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,126
Keh. Keh!

387
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:53,275
So I'm putting out a BOLO
on Sloth from<i> The Goonies?</i>

388
00:50:55,277 --> 00:50:57,320
- You okay? Okay.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

389
00:51:00,156 --> 00:51:01,241
Reg...

390
00:51:07,163 --> 00:51:10,584
Um, you wanna take a seat
while she... while you wait?

391
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,294
Oh, yeah.

392
00:51:58,632 --> 00:51:59,633
Hello?

393
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:02,636
<i> Hello, Emily.</i>

394
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:17,609
My name is Madison.

395
00:52:17,692 --> 00:52:21,696
<i> Your fake mother</i>
<i>gave you the name Madison.</i>

396
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,991
<i>Your shitty marriage
gave you the name Mitchell.</i>

397
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:28,995
<i>But you'll always
be Emily to me.</i>

398
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,497
Who are you?

399
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,500
<i> You know who I am.</i>

400
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:37,504
<i>Even if they say
I'm only in your head.</i>

401
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:40,215
I don't know what
you're talking about.

402
00:52:40,298 --> 00:52:43,677
<i>You let them tell you
I wasn't real,</i>

403
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,595
<i>that I was just a voice.</i>

404
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:47,847
<i>And you believed them.</i>

405
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:52,602
<i>Now, I'm going to make
them pay for what they did.</i>

406
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:55,063
<i>One by one.</i>

407
00:52:55,146 --> 00:52:56,189
Gabriel, no!

408
00:53:01,236 --> 00:53:02,821
<i>See?</i>

409
00:53:02,904 --> 00:53:05,156
<i>- Deep down...</i>
- Please.

410
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,367
- ...<i> you've always known.</i>
- Please.

411
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,537
Please stop. Please.

412
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,499
<i> Oh, we are</i>
<i>just getting started.</i>

413
00:53:25,844 --> 00:53:27,053
Uh, Detective,
if we're done here,

414
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:28,221
- we're leaving. Thank you.
- Um...

415
00:53:28,304 --> 00:53:31,141
Okay. All right, well, I'm...

416
00:53:31,224 --> 00:53:33,184
I'll see you around, okay?

417
00:53:36,062 --> 00:53:38,398
Hey, hey, hey,
you finish aging that photo?

418
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,942
Yeah, I left it on your desk.
You saw it, right?

419
00:53:41,026 --> 00:53:43,028
That's why you brought her in.

420
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:45,947
- Brought who in?
- The girl in the picture.

421
00:53:46,906 --> 00:53:47,907
Yeesh.

422
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,247
Ah, hell.

423
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:57,208
She was the doctor's patient.

424
00:53:57,292 --> 00:53:59,502
What? We've gotta turn around
and tell Kekoa.

425
00:53:59,586 --> 00:54:00,587
We can trace the call.

426
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,756
The cops think I did it.

427
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:03,923
Well, this will
prove them wrong.

428
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,091
His name is Gabriel.

429
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:07,927
I don't know how I knew,

430
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,096
but talking to him, I just did.

431
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,349
He's someone from my past.

432
00:54:13,433 --> 00:54:15,477
From before I could remember.

433
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,401
Where are we going?

434
00:54:37,582 --> 00:54:39,209
Oh, Maddy.

435
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,211
Maddy.

436
00:54:41,294 --> 00:54:44,464
- I just had to see you.
- Oh.

437
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:48,176
How are you holding up,
sweetie, hmm? Are you eating?

438
00:54:48,259 --> 00:54:51,971
You look skinny.
I gotta cook more.

439
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,641
Mom, I need you to remember.

440
00:54:55,767 --> 00:54:57,685
During the adoption,
did they say

441
00:54:57,769 --> 00:55:00,105
if I had a brother or anything?

442
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:02,982
No.

443
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:06,694
The only thing they would say
is if there were siblings,

444
00:55:06,778 --> 00:55:08,988
they try to place them
in the same family.

445
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:10,698
Then who the hell is Gabriel?

446
00:55:16,037 --> 00:55:19,666
Mom?
Mom, what do you know?

447
00:55:28,383 --> 00:55:30,343
You wanted a party
so bad, Maddy,

448
00:55:30,426 --> 00:55:33,471
you nagged us
until your father gave in.

449
00:55:33,555 --> 00:55:35,348
We invited
your whole class but...

450
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:37,100
They thought I was a freak.

451
00:55:37,183 --> 00:55:39,602
I had no friends.
I remember that.

452
00:55:50,864 --> 00:55:51,990
<i>Blow it out, blow it out,
blow it out.</i>

453
00:55:52,073 --> 00:55:53,158
<i> For nine wishes.</i>

454
00:55:58,371 --> 00:55:59,998
<i> Those look good.</i>
<i>Looks good.</i>

455
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:01,916
<i>Stop saying that.</i>

456
00:56:03,918 --> 00:56:05,628
<i>They are.</i>

457
00:56:05,712 --> 00:56:09,340
<i>Maddy, who are you talking to?</i>

458
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,843
<i>No one.</i>

459
00:56:11,926 --> 00:56:14,929
<i> Maddy? Maddy,</i>
<i>what did we say about lying?</i>

460
00:56:15,013 --> 00:56:16,264
<i>I wasn't.</i>

461
00:56:16,347 --> 00:56:18,474
<i>Well, then
who were you talking to?</i>

462
00:56:21,561 --> 00:56:22,687
<i>Gabriel.</i>

463
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:32,864
<i>Is he your imaginary friend?</i>

464
00:56:32,947 --> 00:56:34,741
<i>Gabriel isn't made up.</i>

465
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,245
<i>He says that you are.</i>

466
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,789
<i>He says you're not
my real family.</i>

467
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:48,504
<i>- This is the nightmare that...</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

468
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:53,509
<i>Ooh, that's a kick.</i>

469
00:56:53,593 --> 00:56:55,011
<i> Ooh.</i>

470
00:56:55,094 --> 00:56:56,679
<i>My little Christmas cutie
right here.</i>

471
00:56:56,763 --> 00:56:59,307
<i>- Go get her ready for bed.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

472
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:01,434
<i>Maddy, playtime's over.</i>

473
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:04,854
<i>Santa won't come down the
chimney if you're still up.</i>

474
00:57:04,938 --> 00:57:08,233
<i>Mommy said she'd love me
when the baby comes.</i>

475
00:57:08,316 --> 00:57:10,151
<i>She said nothing would change.</i>

476
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,447
<i>I won't.</i>

477
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,616
<i>You can't make me.</i>

478
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,870
<i>Please don't hurt the baby.</i>

479
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:24,666
<i> Maddy? What's going on?</i>

480
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:27,585
<i>Nothing, Daddy.</i>

481
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:35,134
Some of the conversations
you had with Gabriel

482
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,928
just chilled us to the bone.

483
00:57:37,011 --> 00:57:40,473
Wait, so Gabriel was something
that I made up?

484
00:57:40,556 --> 00:57:42,976
Whatever you went through
before you joined our family,

485
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:46,896
it hurt you in a way
that I can't even imagine.

486
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,482
I always figured
you created Gabriel

487
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:51,859
so that you could survive that.

488
00:57:51,943 --> 00:57:54,988
We thought if we
gave you enough love,

489
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,490
you wouldn't need him anymore.

490
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,495
I hope we weren't wrong.

491
00:58:28,646 --> 00:58:29,856
E. May...

492
00:58:40,325 --> 00:58:43,828
<i>Thursday, July 23rd, 1992.</i>

493
00:58:43,911 --> 00:58:45,496
<i>Today marks the seventh year</i>

494
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:48,541
<i>since Emily May
was entrusted into our care.</i>

495
00:58:48,624 --> 00:58:50,543
<i>She remains unlike
any test subject</i>

496
00:58:50,626 --> 00:58:53,212
<i>we have ever encountered
here at the clinic.</i>

497
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:55,006
<i>Though in recent months,
Emily started</i>

498
00:58:55,089 --> 00:58:57,467
<i>exhibiting signs
of mental psychosis.</i>

499
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,427
<i>She says she's seeing visions,</i>

500
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:02,680
<i>and hearing thoughts
from the Devil.</i>

501
00:59:02,764 --> 00:59:06,225
<i>I've contacted Dr. John
Gregory out at Hopkins</i>

502
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,727
<i>as well as Dr. Victor Fields</i>

503
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,437
<i>from the Los Angeles
Children's Hospital,</i>

504
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,732
<i>just to help determine
a course of action.</i>

505
00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:18,071
Dr. Florence Weaver.
Dr. Victor Fields.

506
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,572
Working the same case

507
00:59:19,655 --> 00:59:22,158
along with Dr. John Gregory.

508
00:59:22,241 --> 00:59:23,368
Holy shit.

509
01:00:26,681 --> 01:00:30,476
Dr. Gregory?
This is Seattle PD.

510
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:39,235
I need you to answer me.

511
01:01:08,806 --> 01:01:12,727
Detective!
He's still here.

512
01:01:13,978 --> 01:01:15,521
He's still here.

513
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:17,064
Oh, Jesus.

514
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,450
Holy shit.

515
01:02:31,305 --> 01:02:33,349
I gotta be
out of my mind.

516
01:03:58,726 --> 01:04:00,311
Stop!

517
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

518
01:05:49,462 --> 01:05:50,713
Fuck me.

519
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

520
01:06:01,432 --> 01:06:02,892
All three victims
were involved

521
01:06:02,975 --> 01:06:05,436
in the same case study
they called<i> Patient May.</i>

522
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:08,689
You were the case study.
They were your doctors.

523
01:06:10,483 --> 01:06:11,859
Uh, I'm sorry.

524
01:06:11,942 --> 01:06:15,196
It's all blank before
Sydney's parents adopted me.

525
01:06:17,948 --> 01:06:20,117
I think you were born Emily May.

526
01:06:25,664 --> 01:06:27,416
That's what he calls me.

527
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:30,461
Madison,

528
01:06:30,544 --> 01:06:32,505
the department works
with a hypnotherapist

529
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:34,548
that helps unlock
repressed memories.

530
01:06:34,632 --> 01:06:38,010
Trauma, sexual abuse, PTSD.

531
01:06:38,093 --> 01:06:40,012
Would you be willing to see one?

532
01:06:40,095 --> 01:06:41,347
I knew it.

533
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,933
She's not a psychic,
God damn it.

534
01:06:47,978 --> 01:06:50,356
<i> We are gonna</i>
<i>turn back the hands of time.</i>

535
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:53,692
The bygone years
reconstructing themselves.

536
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:56,445
I want you to go back
to before the adoption.

537
01:06:56,529 --> 01:06:59,031
I think I'm in a hospital.

538
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,701
But I don't remember any of it.

539
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:03,911
Okay, you've gone back

540
01:07:03,994 --> 01:07:05,412
beyond your conscious memories.

541
01:07:05,496 --> 01:07:08,332
Can you tell us why
you're in the hospital?

542
01:07:13,128 --> 01:07:14,505
I'm not sure.

543
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,344
But I'm better now.

544
01:07:20,427 --> 01:07:23,264
That's why they're here for me.

545
01:07:23,347 --> 01:07:26,267
- Who?
- My new parents.

546
01:07:27,935 --> 01:07:30,604
They've come to take me
to my new home.

547
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,857
It's nice.

548
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:38,362
But he's here too.

549
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,411
Gabriel.

550
01:07:49,748 --> 01:07:52,418
He followed me home
from the hospital.

551
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:56,672
Who is Gabriel?
Is he a friend?

552
01:07:56,755 --> 01:08:01,510
He says he is, but I'm the
only one that can see him.

553
01:08:01,594 --> 01:08:02,928
You ruined
your mother's cake.

554
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:05,014
- I didn't, it was Gabriel.
- Stop.

555
01:08:05,097 --> 01:08:06,974
You can't keep lying
like this, Maddy.

556
01:08:07,057 --> 01:08:09,226
- I'm not lying.
- There's no Gabriel.

557
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:12,813
Go to your room. Madison,
go to your room right now.

558
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:17,943
<i> So when</i>
<i>he does something bad,</i>

559
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,654
<i>I'm the one
that gets in trouble.</i>

560
01:08:35,669 --> 01:08:36,837
Go away.

561
01:08:41,508 --> 01:08:42,593
What?

562
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:48,057
But she's sleeping.

563
01:08:54,438 --> 01:08:55,731
I guess.

564
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:02,237
Really? You mean
like a good surprise?

565
01:09:22,216 --> 01:09:23,592
<i> Cut it.</i>

566
01:09:28,555 --> 01:09:33,102
<i>A nice slice of cake for Mom.</i>

567
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:01,547
Madison!

568
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:02,923
<i> Cut her!</i>

569
01:10:05,217 --> 01:10:08,345
No,
it wasn't me! It was Gabriel!

570
01:10:08,429 --> 01:10:11,807
Please! No, no!

571
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:13,308
Please believe me!

572
01:10:14,018 --> 01:10:15,060
Please!

573
01:10:16,395 --> 01:10:18,397
Stop this. Stop this.
Stop this!

574
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,816
Get her out, get her out!
Get her out!

575
01:10:22,317 --> 01:10:24,236
- Stop this. Stop this.
- Beverly...

576
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:25,904
- Beverly!
- Get her out right now!

577
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:28,490
When I touch your forehead,
you will be back with us.

578
01:10:31,368 --> 01:10:33,579
Hey. Okay?

579
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,041
Maddy?

580
01:10:37,124 --> 01:10:38,125
Jesus.

581
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:40,044
Are you okay?

582
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,879
I remember now.

583
01:10:45,382 --> 01:10:47,760
It's happened before,

584
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,970
waking up in strange places,

585
01:10:50,971 --> 01:10:52,473
seeing things.

586
01:10:56,351 --> 01:11:00,314
I don't know how,
but Gabriel wanted to...

587
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:08,781
What did he want, Madison?

588
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:13,577
To hurt the baby.

589
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:19,124
It's as if he knew
that with you here...

590
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:23,045
I wouldn't need him anymore.

591
01:11:25,672 --> 01:11:27,299
And he was right.

592
01:11:28,258 --> 01:11:30,386
He became a lost memory,

593
01:11:30,469 --> 01:11:33,097
buried deep in the back
of my head...

594
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:36,183
until now.

595
01:11:40,521 --> 01:11:42,940
The killer said he was Gabriel.

596
01:11:44,942 --> 01:11:47,319
My Gabriel.

597
01:11:50,531 --> 01:11:53,700
Wait, are you saying
that the killer is

598
01:11:54,618 --> 01:11:56,662
your imaginary friend?

599
01:13:11,278 --> 01:13:12,279
Whoa!

600
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:13,822
Fuck!

601
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

602
01:13:50,275 --> 01:13:51,985
Everything's
gonna be okay.

603
01:13:53,403 --> 01:13:56,156
Maddy? Maddy, listen.

604
01:14:00,077 --> 01:14:02,663
Wait. Please.

605
01:14:03,997 --> 01:14:06,625
Detective, wait. Please.

606
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:07,918
I don't know what's going on,

607
01:14:08,001 --> 01:14:09,628
but Maddy couldn't
have done this.

608
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,088
You can't come back in here.
This is a crime scene now.

609
01:14:11,171 --> 01:14:12,589
- Please just listen to me.
- No, you listen.

610
01:14:12,673 --> 01:14:14,174
Back off,
or I'm gonna charge you

611
01:14:14,258 --> 01:14:15,551
with being an accomplice.

612
01:14:18,512 --> 01:14:19,513
Please.

613
01:14:21,848 --> 01:14:24,184
Hey, you guys gotta see this.

614
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:44,204
This is what he kills with.

615
01:14:44,288 --> 01:14:45,872
It's the rest of
the missing trophy,

616
01:14:45,956 --> 01:14:48,208
fashioned into a weapon.

617
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:53,213
I told you, from day one.

618
01:14:59,011 --> 01:15:02,681
You got the murder weapon,
the coat, the gloves,

619
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:05,767
and Jeffrey Dahmer's workshop
in your attic.

620
01:15:05,851 --> 01:15:07,477
It's over, Madison.

621
01:15:07,561 --> 01:15:10,022
It was... It was Gabriel.

622
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:13,525
He got into my house.
He's done it before.

623
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:14,943
Enough with the bogeyman story.

624
01:15:15,027 --> 01:15:16,820
Please, Kekoa. Please.

625
01:15:16,903 --> 01:15:18,238
You've seen him.

626
01:15:18,322 --> 01:15:19,865
You know that it's not me.

627
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:22,951
- Who is the woman, Madison?
- I don't know.

628
01:15:23,035 --> 01:15:25,203
Gabriel must have snuck her
into my house.

629
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:27,080
Let me
tell you what I think.

630
01:15:27,164 --> 01:15:29,416
You were sick in the head
when you were young.

631
01:15:29,499 --> 01:15:33,545
Those doctors helped you.
It worked for a while.

632
01:15:33,628 --> 01:15:35,172
But now your sickness is back

633
01:15:35,255 --> 01:15:37,924
and you blame them
for fucking you up.

634
01:15:38,008 --> 01:15:40,427
No. No.

635
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:43,013
It's not me.

636
01:15:43,096 --> 01:15:44,222
Stop lying to us.

637
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:45,849
I'm telling the fucking truth!

638
01:15:50,187 --> 01:15:51,355
Shit!

639
01:16:03,367 --> 01:16:05,702
He wants to talk to you.

640
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You have got to be kidding me.

641
01:16:20,133 --> 01:16:21,760
This is Detective Shaw.

642
01:16:29,226 --> 01:16:33,271
<i> Hello, Detective.</i>

643
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:34,856
Who am I talking to?

644
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:40,612
<i> You know who I am.</i>
<i>You found me.</i>

645
01:16:40,695 --> 01:16:43,782
I didn't find you soon enough.

646
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:48,787
<i>But you found my things.
I want them back.</i>

647
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:51,081
Why was your stuff
in her attic, hmm?

648
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:55,043
You trying to incriminate her?

649
01:16:55,127 --> 01:17:00,382
<i>Dumb bitch didn't even know
I was nesting in her home.</i>

650
01:17:00,465 --> 01:17:02,592
Is all this personal?

651
01:17:02,676 --> 01:17:07,389
<i>If my blade had punched a hole
in your face last night,</i>

652
01:17:07,472 --> 01:17:10,100
<i>would that have been personal?</i>

653
01:17:12,018 --> 01:17:13,937
Who are you, Gabriel?

654
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:17,983
<i>Oh, I thought she had
already told you.</i>

655
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:21,111
<i>I'm a figment
of her imagination.</i>

656
01:17:27,826 --> 01:17:31,663
<i>Ask her what
she used to call me.</i>

657
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:38,462
The Devil.

658
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:49,890
You see, Syd? That's why
we never throw anything out.

659
01:17:49,973 --> 01:17:54,936
You never know when something
would come in handy.

660
01:17:56,021 --> 01:17:57,355
Here.

661
01:17:57,439 --> 01:17:58,857
<i>Yes, we had an Emily May.</i>

662
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,442
<i>She was remanded to our care</i>

663
01:18:00,525 --> 01:18:02,277
<i>by the Simion Research Hospital.</i>

664
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,404
<i>It says here they've been
shuttered since the 90s.</i>

665
01:18:04,488 --> 01:18:06,406
So it's just been
sitting there empty?

666
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:09,242
<i>Sorry, I don't know.
That was before my time.</i>

667
01:18:20,962 --> 01:18:22,047
Whoa.

668
01:20:01,354 --> 01:20:05,108
Records storage.
Basement Level.

669
01:20:06,276 --> 01:20:07,819
Of course.

670
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:17,078
Please, Officer. Officer!
I'm not supposed to be here!

671
01:20:17,162 --> 01:20:19,581
I haven't done anything wrong!

672
01:20:19,664 --> 01:20:22,834
I am not supposed to be here,
God damn it!

673
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:25,837
They made a mistake.

674
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:53,823
Princess.

675
01:21:20,725 --> 01:21:21,976
Emily May.

676
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:36,324
"...the result
of an absorption in utero,

677
01:21:36,408 --> 01:21:39,160
"growing in sync
with patient..."

678
01:22:02,559 --> 01:22:04,769
<i>Today, we'll be speaking
to the subjects' mother,</i>

679
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:06,020
<i>Serena May.</i>

680
01:22:06,104 --> 01:22:07,564
<i>15 years of age.</i>

681
01:22:07,647 --> 01:22:10,024
<i>Poor girl was raped and
carried her pregnancy to term.</i>

682
01:22:10,108 --> 01:22:13,153
<i>She's decided to entrust
her children to our care.</i>

683
01:22:13,236 --> 01:22:15,613
<i>This could be
a phenomenal opportunity</i>

684
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:17,198
<i>to further our research.</i>

685
01:22:19,826 --> 01:22:24,372
<i>Now, are you sure
you want to do this, Serena?</i>

686
01:22:25,915 --> 01:22:29,002
<i>It's okay,
there's no judgment here.</i>

687
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:33,590
<i>Mama won't help me.</i>

688
01:22:35,467 --> 01:22:39,679
<i>She called my pregnancy
a transgression against God.</i>

689
01:22:39,763 --> 01:22:42,766
<i>I don't know how to look
after them on my own.</i>

690
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:48,730
<i>He's an abomination.</i>

691
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:53,777
<i>I don't know what else
to do, Doctor.</i>

692
01:22:58,531 --> 01:23:01,034
<i>Please look after Emily.</i>

693
01:23:01,117 --> 01:23:03,453
<i> Don't worry.</i>
<i>You can have peace of mind</i>

694
01:23:03,536 --> 01:23:05,038
<i>knowing we'll provide
the best medical care.</i>

695
01:23:05,121 --> 01:23:08,416
They told me that she died
while giving birth.

696
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,669
Those lying cock-knockers.

697
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:13,171
<i> Now,</i>
<i>we're just going to need you</i>

698
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:15,882
<i>and your mother
to sign some paperwork.</i>

699
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:37,946
When will she wake up?

700
01:23:38,029 --> 01:23:41,157
She's in a coma, Detective.
It's in God's hands.

701
01:23:41,241 --> 01:23:44,702
Hey, you were right
about the Underground.

702
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:48,039
Jane Doe was a tour guide
down there.

703
01:23:48,122 --> 01:23:49,541
Employee of the Month.

704
01:23:53,211 --> 01:23:54,921
Serena May.

705
01:23:56,673 --> 01:23:58,508
This is Madison's birth mother.

706
01:24:12,939 --> 01:24:15,650
<i>Emily, are you okay?</i>

707
01:24:19,779 --> 01:24:21,322
<i>Are you scared?</i>

708
01:24:23,616 --> 01:24:26,411
<i>Well, don't be.
He won't wake up, I promise.</i>

709
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:28,079
<i>I've given him a heavy sedative.</i>

710
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:31,499
<i>It's probably why
you're feeling sleepy too.</i>

711
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:33,918
<i>We just wanted
a private moment with you</i>

712
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:36,379
<i>without Gabriel listening in.</i>

713
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:46,764
<i>We've noticed in recent weeks
you've become more aggressive.</i>

714
01:24:47,599 --> 01:24:49,559
<i>Can you tell us why?</i>

715
01:24:53,396 --> 01:24:55,940
<i>He's been telling me
to do things.</i>

716
01:24:57,066 --> 01:25:00,612
<i>Bad things.
To hurt people.</i>

717
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:03,156
<i> Is that why</i>
<i>you attacked Bobby Fey?</i>

718
01:25:06,242 --> 01:25:08,912
<i>But Bobby's twice your size.</i>

719
01:25:12,665 --> 01:25:15,043
<i>Gabriel makes me strong.</i>

720
01:25:18,755 --> 01:25:20,590
<i>He told me to kill Bobby.</i>

721
01:25:22,759 --> 01:25:25,094
<i> He actually</i>
<i>said those words?</i>

722
01:25:28,431 --> 01:25:32,477
<i>Sometimes he speaks words...</i>

723
01:25:33,937 --> 01:25:37,649
<i>and other times,
the words are in my head.</i>

724
01:25:39,859 --> 01:25:41,361
<i>And then...</i>

725
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:46,282
<i>Then they aren't
really words anymore.</i>

726
01:25:47,784 --> 01:25:50,078
<i>Just feelings.</i>

727
01:25:52,246 --> 01:25:54,791
<i>But I knew what
he wanted me to do.</i>

728
01:25:59,253 --> 01:26:01,214
<i>He pretends to be nice.</i>

729
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,010
<i>But he's the Devil.</i>

730
01:26:09,263 --> 01:26:10,431
<i> Okay.</i>

731
01:26:15,186 --> 01:26:16,813
<i>I'm going to wake him up.</i>

732
01:26:16,896 --> 01:26:20,733
<i>Why don't you come around
after I've injected him?</i>

733
01:26:35,498 --> 01:26:36,958
Oh, my God!

734
01:26:37,041 --> 01:26:38,710
Oh, God!

735
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:39,877
Oh, my God! Maddy!

736
01:26:41,879 --> 01:26:44,465
<i>So what exactly is Gabriel?</i>

737
01:26:44,549 --> 01:26:48,553
<i>Gabriel is an extreme version
of a teratoma.</i>

738
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:51,556
<i>A tumor consisting of tissues,
hair, teeth, muscles, bones.</i>

739
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:53,766
<i>But more specifically,
in this case,</i>

740
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:56,978
<i>it's a parasitic twin.</i>

741
01:26:57,061 --> 01:26:59,063
<i>When two embryos
develop in the womb</i>

742
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:00,982
<i>don't separate like they should,</i>

743
01:27:01,065 --> 01:27:02,316
<i>one twin is dominant,</i>

744
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,860
<i>while the other
is underdeveloped.</i>

745
01:27:03,943 --> 01:27:05,111
<i>It's not considered conjoined</i>

746
01:27:05,194 --> 01:27:06,654
<i>because the underdeveloped twin</i>

747
01:27:06,738 --> 01:27:08,239
<i>is dependent on the body
of the other.</i>

748
01:27:08,322 --> 01:27:13,703
<i>Like a parasite,
Gabriel feeds off Emily.</i>

749
01:27:13,786 --> 01:27:15,621
What's the matter,
Pollyanna?

750
01:27:15,705 --> 01:27:18,291
You get lost on the way
to the country club?

751
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:29,427
Look, I don't want any trouble.

752
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,387
I don't give a fuck
what you want.

753
01:27:40,813 --> 01:27:42,190
<i>An apple.</i>

754
01:27:44,484 --> 01:27:46,194
<i>Pig.</i>

755
01:27:46,277 --> 01:27:47,612
<i>A teddy bear.</i>

756
01:27:47,695 --> 01:27:49,447
<i>We're starting to suspect
that Gabriel</i>

757
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:51,532
<i>can somehow access
the region to the brain</i>

758
01:27:51,616 --> 01:27:53,785
<i>that process visual stimuli,</i>

759
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:56,829
<i>and make Emily see
what he wants her to see.</i>

760
01:27:56,913 --> 01:27:58,748
<i>This would explain
her recent claims</i>

761
01:27:58,831 --> 01:28:03,169
<i>of hallucinations
and waking dreams.</i>

762
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:06,297
What the fuck
did you do to get in here?

763
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:08,174
Forget to separate
the recycling?

764
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:12,553
But I'm willing to play nice
for a price.

765
01:28:14,388 --> 01:28:16,015
What you got?

766
01:28:16,099 --> 01:28:17,975
Guard!

767
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:19,060
No! No!

768
01:28:23,397 --> 01:28:24,440
Bitch.

769
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:39,080
<i>Gabriel, stop it.</i>

770
01:28:59,809 --> 01:29:01,811
What the fuck?

771
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:05,439
Oh, shit.

772
01:29:05,523 --> 01:29:07,024
Yo, this bitch
is having a seizure.

773
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:08,985
<i>Because they literally
share the same brain,</i>

774
01:29:09,068 --> 01:29:10,778
<i>I think he's able
to trick her mind</i>

775
01:29:10,862 --> 01:29:13,281
<i>and make her think she's
living her life as usual.</i>

776
01:29:13,364 --> 01:29:17,201
<i>Essentially, placing her
in a mental prison.</i>

777
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:18,870
<i>When in reality,</i>

778
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:22,665
<i>Gabriel has hijacked her body
and is using it himself.</i>

779
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:31,299
<i>It's time to cut out the cancer.</i>

780
01:29:31,382 --> 01:29:34,343
<i>Gabriel's parasitic nature
has increased significantly</i>

781
01:29:34,427 --> 01:29:37,180
<i>as he's now siphoning
more fluids and nutrients,</i>

782
01:29:37,263 --> 01:29:39,015
<i>resulting in severe weight loss.</i>

783
01:29:39,098 --> 01:29:41,309
<i>So Dr. Fields, Dr. Gregory,
and myself have concluded,</i>

784
01:29:41,392 --> 01:29:45,813
<i>the only way to save Emily
is to excise the teratoma.</i>

785
01:29:45,897 --> 01:29:48,608
<i>Now, Gabriel is conjoined
at the brain,</i>

786
01:29:49,901 --> 01:29:52,069
<i>so full removal could kill Emily</i>

787
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:54,488
<i>or result in permanent
brain damage.</i>

788
01:29:54,572 --> 01:29:57,742
<i>Course of action would be
to remove what we can</i>

789
01:29:57,825 --> 01:30:00,494
<i>and suppress the rest
into her skull.</i>

790
01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:03,581
<i>Let's close her up.</i>

791
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:39,700
What the fuck?

792
01:30:51,254 --> 01:30:53,172
Holy shit! Oh, God damn!

793
01:31:33,921 --> 01:31:35,047
Get me outta here!

794
01:31:36,215 --> 01:31:38,217
Guard!
Get the motherfuckin' guard!

795
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:45,266
Guard!

796
01:31:46,767 --> 01:31:49,645
Hey! Open
the motherfuckin' door!

797
01:31:51,647 --> 01:31:53,107
No!

798
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:57,820
Holy shit! Hey!

799
01:32:27,683 --> 01:32:28,976
<i> Keh? Listen.</i>

800
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:31,270
Gabriel is inside of Madison.

801
01:32:31,354 --> 01:32:32,772
He's been using her
this whole time.

802
01:32:32,855 --> 01:32:35,816
He's been controlling her body
like a puppet.

803
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,777
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Sydney, slow down.

804
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:39,153
You're not making any sense.

805
01:32:39,236 --> 01:32:40,488
<i> I found</i>
<i>Madison's history.</i>

806
01:32:40,571 --> 01:32:42,573
She was born
with a parasitic twin.

807
01:32:42,656 --> 01:32:45,826
<i>Gabriel has been dormant
all of these years.</i>

808
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:47,161
When Derek smashed
Madison's head

809
01:32:47,244 --> 01:32:48,829
against the wall,
it woke Gabriel up.

810
01:32:48,913 --> 01:32:50,206
Bitch!

811
01:32:50,289 --> 01:32:52,917
Jeez, Sydney, that's insane.

812
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,628
Madison's birth mother is
still alive, Keh. They lied.

813
01:32:55,711 --> 01:32:57,004
I know. She's the woman

814
01:32:57,088 --> 01:32:58,589
who fell out of Madison's attic.

815
01:32:58,672 --> 01:33:00,091
We sent her to Seattle Medical.

816
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:01,759
Are you kidding me?
We have to talk to her.

817
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:04,095
She's the only person
left alive who knows anything.

818
01:33:29,537 --> 01:33:31,330
It's in the stairs, quick!

819
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:40,589
- It's coming from inside.
- Shit.

820
01:33:40,673 --> 01:33:42,133
I gotta go. I gotta go.

821
01:33:43,551 --> 01:33:45,928
Keh? Keh?

822
01:33:46,011 --> 01:33:47,221
Fuck.

823
01:34:59,418 --> 01:35:01,003
Oh, God.

824
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

825
01:36:04,984 --> 01:36:06,694
Shit! We're getting shot at!

826
01:36:10,072 --> 01:36:11,156
Stay back.

827
01:36:28,882 --> 01:36:30,092
We need backup.

828
01:36:30,175 --> 01:36:31,844
Send the National fucking Guard!

829
01:36:49,528 --> 01:36:50,529
Madison!

830
01:37:08,422 --> 01:37:10,090
Madison!

831
01:37:17,723 --> 01:37:19,350
Get off him, motherfucker!

832
01:37:25,105 --> 01:37:27,024
Fuck!

833
01:37:41,955 --> 01:37:43,207
Oh, my God.

834
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:45,167
Okay. Fuck.

835
01:37:50,297 --> 01:37:52,216
Told you not to get
your ass kicked.

836
01:37:52,299 --> 01:37:54,218
Okay.

837
01:38:50,691 --> 01:38:51,942
Regina.

838
01:38:52,025 --> 01:38:53,610
Oh, my God, Kekoa!

839
01:38:58,866 --> 01:39:00,159
Why am I calling the police?

840
01:39:00,242 --> 01:39:02,953
Call paramedics. Now!

841
01:39:04,037 --> 01:39:05,038
Oh, Reg...

842
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:08,959
Oh, my God.

843
01:39:09,042 --> 01:39:12,755
The mother, she's going for her.

844
01:39:12,838 --> 01:39:15,632
The hospital. You gotta go.

845
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:18,802
I'll stay with her. It's okay.
Paramedics are on the way.

846
01:39:18,886 --> 01:39:21,555
I'll be fine. Now go stop him.

847
01:39:21,638 --> 01:39:22,681
Go!

848
01:39:32,649 --> 01:39:34,234
Sorry, ma'am,
this area is restricted.

849
01:39:34,318 --> 01:39:35,736
Right, I know, Officer,

850
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:38,071
but if you could just call
Detective Kekoa Shaw,

851
01:39:38,155 --> 01:39:39,364
then he can fill you in,

852
01:39:39,448 --> 01:39:40,741
and just tell him
that Sydney Lake is here.

853
01:39:40,824 --> 01:39:42,451
I'm sorry.
Nobody is allowed in here.

854
01:39:42,534 --> 01:39:45,370
I cannot let you by unless
Detective Shaw is here with...

855
01:39:48,081 --> 01:39:50,876
What's wrong? Are you okay?

856
01:39:50,959 --> 01:39:53,545
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

857
01:39:53,629 --> 01:39:55,964
Are you having a heart attack?

858
01:39:56,048 --> 01:39:58,592
- My pacemaker.
- Okay.

859
01:39:58,675 --> 01:40:00,177
It's burning.

860
01:40:02,763 --> 01:40:04,598
- Please go get help.
- Okay.

861
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:19,696
Sydney!

862
01:40:22,407 --> 01:40:24,326

<i> She chose you...</i>
<i>...over me.</i>
<i>Her own flesh and blood.</i>

<i>I should have killed you
before you were born!</i>

865
01:40:41,969 --> 01:40:43,053
Gabriel, no!

866
01:40:44,513 --> 01:40:46,390
Gabriel.

867
01:40:50,519 --> 01:40:53,063
Please forgive me.

868
01:40:56,942 --> 01:41:00,028
I should never have
given you away.

869
01:41:04,449 --> 01:41:06,285
You were my son.

870
01:41:07,744 --> 01:41:11,415
And I should have loved you
no matter what.

871
01:41:21,508 --> 01:41:23,427
Emily!

872
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:25,554
No! No! No!
You're hurting her!

873
01:41:25,637 --> 01:41:27,389
Sydney, get outta here!

874
01:41:39,526 --> 01:41:40,611
<i> Go on.</i>

875
01:41:40,694 --> 01:41:42,112
- Madison?
<i>- Shoot me!</i>

876
01:41:42,195 --> 01:41:44,448
Madison, I know you're in there.

877
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:46,158
<i> And kill her.</i>

878
01:41:46,241 --> 01:41:47,743
What did you do to my sister?

879
01:41:47,826 --> 01:41:50,329
<i>She's not your sister!</i>

880
01:41:52,581 --> 01:41:53,749
Sydney!

881
01:41:59,046 --> 01:42:01,048
Maddy, please.

882
01:42:01,131 --> 01:42:02,633
<i> She can't hear you.</i>

883
01:42:02,716 --> 01:42:06,345
Maddy, I know you can hear me.
You have to fight him.

884
01:42:06,428 --> 01:42:07,721
<i> Madison's not home.</i>

885
01:42:07,804 --> 01:42:09,890
Madison, he killed your babies.

886
01:42:09,973 --> 01:42:12,267
He was the cause
of your miscarriages.

887
01:42:12,351 --> 01:42:14,686
He was feeding off
of your fetuses

888
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:17,272
to build himself back up.

889
01:42:17,356 --> 01:42:20,150
Maddy, please, please come back.

890
01:42:40,253 --> 01:42:42,422
<i> Goodbye, sis.</i>

891
01:42:42,506 --> 01:42:43,799
Gabriel, no!

892
01:42:50,597 --> 01:42:52,683
<i> I wanted you to see...</i>

893
01:42:52,766 --> 01:42:54,518
No, Gabriel. Please.

894
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:56,645
<i>...what you made me.</i>

895
01:42:56,728 --> 01:42:58,271
I'm so sorry.

896
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:17,708
<i> A monster.</i>

897
01:43:19,292 --> 01:43:20,627
<i> No, Gabriel.</i>

898
01:43:20,711 --> 01:43:22,879
<i>You were always a monster.</i>

899
01:43:25,966 --> 01:43:27,175
<i> What?</i>

900
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:30,470
<i>What's happening?</i>

901
01:43:30,554 --> 01:43:31,805
<i>Madison...</i>

902
01:43:43,483 --> 01:43:46,987
Now, I can do
all the mind tricks you can.

903
01:43:52,242 --> 01:43:53,827
<i> No.</i>

904
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:55,954
Not possible!

905
01:43:56,038 --> 01:44:00,625
Did you forget
we share the same brain?

906
01:44:03,336 --> 01:44:06,423
I didn't ask
to be tethered to you.

907
01:44:06,506 --> 01:44:09,134
You don't deserve your body.

908
01:44:09,217 --> 01:44:11,011
I can use it better than you.

909
01:44:11,845 --> 01:44:14,222
Not anymore.

910
01:44:14,306 --> 01:44:17,601
You don't get to control me
ever again.

911
01:44:19,227 --> 01:44:21,354
It's over, Gabriel.

912
01:44:21,438 --> 01:44:23,106
I'm taking it all back.

913
01:44:23,190 --> 01:44:28,278
My mind, my body, my everything.

914
01:44:28,361 --> 01:44:32,407
Now, you get to live
in a world that I create.

915
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:40,624
You can't lock me
in here forever.

916
01:44:40,707 --> 01:44:42,793
You'll always be stuck with me.

917
01:44:42,876 --> 01:44:44,711
Sooner or later I will get out.

918
01:44:44,795 --> 01:44:49,591
I know, but next time
I'll be ready for you.

919
01:45:22,082 --> 01:45:23,083
Maddy?

920
01:45:27,254 --> 01:45:29,506
Maddy? Is that you?

921
01:45:29,589 --> 01:45:32,551
Sydney, I'm so sorry.

922
01:45:32,634 --> 01:45:34,094
I'm gonna lift this off you.

923
01:45:34,177 --> 01:45:35,679
No, it's too heavy.

924
01:45:35,762 --> 01:45:38,265
It was always my body.

925
01:45:38,348 --> 01:45:43,103
If he was strong enough
to do this, then so am I.

926
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:57,325
Hey. Hey.

927
01:45:57,409 --> 01:45:59,703
Hey, stay with me. Hey.

928
01:45:59,786 --> 01:46:01,705
Hey, look at me. Hey.

929
01:46:21,183 --> 01:46:23,810
All my life, I've yearned

930
01:46:23,894 --> 01:46:27,272
for a blood connection
with someone.

931
01:46:27,355 --> 01:46:31,776
Yet in the end, it was right
in front of me all along.

932
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:39,159
Blood or not, you will
always be my sister.

933
01:46:41,661 --> 01:46:44,956
And I will always love you.
