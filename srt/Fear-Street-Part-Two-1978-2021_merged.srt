00:00:02,958 --> 00:00:05,541
<i>Shadyside, small-town America.</i>

2
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:10,833
<i>But among locals, a history of horror
has earned it another nickname,</i>

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,291
<i>"Killer Capital USA."</i>

4
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,375
<i>And last night…</i>

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,250
<i>…tragedy struck again.</i>

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,875
<i>I'm here with Sheriff Nick Goode.</i>

7
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,708
<i>Sheriff, what can you tell us?</i>

8
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,375
<i>Um, there were seven victims.</i>

9
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,291
<i>None of this… is random.</i>

10
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,875
Oh my God!

11
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,000
<i>These massacres</i>
<i>are connected to Sarah Fier.</i>

12
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,708
1666,
Sarah Fier was hanged for witchcraft.

13
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,208
She's been possessing people,
turning them into killers,

14
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,916
to take revenge on the town.

15
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:50,750
Go! Go!

16
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,125
But in 1978,
there was one survivor, C. Berman.

17
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,333
She's the key.

18
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,458
<i>It's over.</i>

19
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:09,875
<i>Over?</i>

20
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,500
<i>It's never over.</i>

21
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,291
<i>Sam…</i>

22
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,750
Get off!

23
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,166
I'm going to get you back.

24
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,916
<i>Killer Capital, USA.</i>

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,541
<i>After a week of terror,</i>

26
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,916
<i>Shadyside continues to live up
to its twisted nickname.</i>

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,875
<i>Clad in a Halloween skull mask,</i>

28
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,208
<i>Shadyside High graduate Ryan Torres</i>

29
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,416
<i>kicked off the days of terror
with a massacre at the mall.</i>

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,291
<i>And now an already mourning community
is plunged into horror yet again</i>

31
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:15,083
<i>as the Sheriff's Department reports
more carnage at East Union Medical.</i>

32
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:18,291
<i>Police believe the murders
were fueled by amphetamines.</i>

33
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,791
<i>Local teenagers Kate Schmidt
and Simon Kalivoda</i>

34
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,666
<i>are the primary suspects.</i>

35
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,250
<i>The scene of the final carnage
was the local grocery store.</i>

36
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:32,250
<i>Sheriff Nick Goode found the Grab and Bag
soaked in blood and broken dreams.</i>

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

38
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,250
Major, Jesus!

39
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,583
God damn it!

40
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,166
You're an impatient bastard, aren't you?

41
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,833
<i>Sunnyvale is a city of hope.</i>

42
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,125
<i>My family have lived here for generations,
cultivating the growth of our city.</i>

43
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,583
<i>And now, as I take the torch</i>

44
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,541
<i>carried by my forefathers…</i>

45
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,750
<i>…I'm ready to bring my experience
to City Hall for another two years.</i>

46
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,625
<i>I understand the challenges…</i>

47
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,583
<i>I'm here to listen.</i>

48
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,833
<i>Let's work together
to keep Sunnyvale shining!</i>

49
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,791
It's OK. You stay here.
I'm gonna keep us safe, OK?

50
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,500
- Don't fucking move!
- Wait, wait!

51
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,458
Stop, please! Please! We called you.

52
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,750
Hello, my name is Deena Johnson.
We need to know how you survived!

53
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,541
Hey! We're being attacked, alright?
There are killers here!

54
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,458
- <i>Pick up! We need your help!</i>
<i>- Please!</i>

55
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,958
- Hello?
- You're still alive.

56
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,708
C. Berman…

57
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,916
Why the hell would you come here?

58
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,916
No!

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,125
No, no, no! You need to leave! Right now!
You have no idea what you are doing!

60
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,458
Wait! Yeah, exactly.

61
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,500
You are the only person
who knows what we're dealing with.

62
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:26,458
I don't want that thing near me.
Get that car and "it" off my property.

63
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,833
Her name is Sam.

64
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,750
You could have watched us dead
on the six o'clock news,

65
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,916
but you didn't.

66
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,875
You called us back.

67
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,541
I can't help you with this!

68
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,041
You are our last chance! The witch...

69
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,291
No, I'm sorry.

70
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,333
My girlfriend is possessed by her
and tied up in a trunk, but you…

71
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,666
you saw her and you survived.

72
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,333
What was different? Please.

73
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,208
Maybe something happened to you,
something that can help us stop her.

74
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,666
There's not!
You can't stop her.

75
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,208
Run, far as you can, fast as you can!

76
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,875
That is your only chance.

77
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,458
Look, I can't just run!

78
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,333
Look, Sam…

79
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,000
I can't let her die.

80
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,333
I won't!

81
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,333
I love her.

82
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,583
Please!

83
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,625
Just keep her away from Major Tom.

84
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,833
It's completely fine.

85
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,166
She's tied up in the bathroom,
so she, like,

86
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,458
totally can't leave now, we're cool.

87
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,208
Yep, cool.

88
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,750
Cool, cool.

89
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,458
Take a seat.

90
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,750
In Shadyside,

91
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,625
the past is never really past.

92
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:21,291
This was July… 12th.

93
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,166
The summer of 1978.

94
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,333
The first day of camp.

95
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,875
A week later, my sister was dead.

96
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,875
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

97
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,416
You're gonna hang, witch.

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,958
Before the witch's final breath,

99
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,791
she found a way to cheat her death.

100
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,875
Oh God!

101
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,918
By cutting off her wicked hand,
she kept her grip upon our land!

102
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,708
She reaches from beyond the grave,
to make good men her evil slaves.

103
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,666
She'll take your blood, take your head,
she'll follow you until you're dead.

104
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,083
String her up.

105
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,916
No, stop it! Stop it! Stop.

106
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,666
Let me down, you shits! Let me down!

107
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,750
- Well, well. What do we have here?
- Goddamn thief!

108
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,875
No. No, she's no thief.

109
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,708
She's possessed by the witch.

110
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,083
The only way to explain
her psycho behavior.

111
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,833
Fuck you!

112
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,750
Guess we're even now.

113
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,875
You do know what they did
to Sarah Fier, right?

114
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,791
They hanged her,

115
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,833
from this very tree.

116
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,583
But she'd have died forever if you did
what you always do to witches…

117
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,541
You burn them.

118
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,500
- Give me your lighter!
- What?

119
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,791
Give it to me!

120
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,416
Now, hold her legs.

121
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,416
Seriously, Sheila?

122
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,416
Do it!

123
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,083
No, no, no! Stop it!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

124
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,000
- Shut up, you witch.
- Sheila! You made your point.

125
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,666
- Don't! Don't!
- Sheila, it was only ten bucks.

126
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,750
Are we really gonna do this?

127
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,583
- Sheila!
- No, no, no!

128
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,875
Sheila!

129
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,791
- Shit! Will, your brother.
- The hell is this? Let her down!

130
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,041
Nick, I can explain.

131
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,000
Let her down, Will!
I swear to God I'll tell Mom!

132
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,375
I went back to my cabin,
the door was open.

133
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,833
All my money was gone
and Ziggy was just sprinting away.

134
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:03,750
- Because you were chasing me.
- Ziggy! You talk when I tell you to talk.

135
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,291
- Did you see her take it?
- Everyone did.

136
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,833
- Everyone.
- Alright.

137
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,583
Well, that's it, Berman.
Five strikes. You're out.

138
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,458
- I'm out? They just tried to murder me!
- Yeah. And I'll deal with them.

139
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:20,625
But first, get back to camp, call Mommy
because you're done at Nightwing.

140
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,250
- I didn't do it.
- Oh, yeah?

141
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,208
Like you didn't set the camp flag on fire?

142
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,916
Or let out the camp rabbits?
Or graffiti the outhouse stalls?

143
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,041
- I warned you...
- Kurt.

144
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,000
It's not her fault, really.

145
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,791
- She's possessed by Sarah Fier.
- Oh, you…

146
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,916
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey.

147
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,125
We kick her out, somebody's gonna ask
about the burn on her arm.

148
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,000
Then who's in trouble? Huh?

149
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,583
Why don't we just let this one slide?
Yeah?

150
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:55,666
Alright. One more strike and you're out
for real. You hear me, Berman?

151
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,833
One more.

152
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,208
Being bossed around by a Goode.

153
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,416
Wow, some things never change.

154
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,458
God, I hate that little bitch.

155
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,041
Hey.

156
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,708
- Have Nurse Lane check that burn out.
- I'm gonna let it get infected and die.

157
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,291
I don't get a thank you?

158
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,375
Oh!

159
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,541
I'm sorry, I forgot!

160
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,041
Thank you, King of Sunnyvale,

161
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,000
future Police Chief Nick Goode,

162
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,625
for rescuing poor, helpless Shadysider me!

163
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,375
How could I ever repay you?

164
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:37,166
Oh, I know. I'll bat my eyes at you,
like all the other dumbass girls.

165
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,500
Boo!

166
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:18,458
Color War begins tonight, guys! Line up
and grab a shirt! Do you have a shirt?

167
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,250
Blue is for beautiful,
if you live in Shadyside.

168
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,875
Red is for radiance,
if you live in Sunnyvale.

169
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,958
Despite our differences,
we're all perfect!

170
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,791
Even you, Ziggy Berman!

171
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,875
What is this gunk?

172
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,708
It just… It won't come off!

173
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,833
That's been there forever, babe.
Just give that up.

174
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,958
- Tommy!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

175
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:56,416
You're right.
It's just, you know, Color War is tonight.

176
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,958
I'm well aware!

177
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,041
We also have to get the Mess Hall ready.

178
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,750
Oh my gosh.

179
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,833
Oh my gosh. This gosh darn moss!

180
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,708
It's… it's all over me!

181
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,375
Oh, hey! It's OK! This isn't a big deal.

182
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,375
What? No, it's not OK!
It… it… it's stained!

183
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,625
Only Cindy Berman would expect
to clean the outhouse and not get dirty.

184
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,666
It's not funny!

185
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,791
It's kinda funny.

186
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,958
Hey!

187
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,333
- What did we talk about?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

188
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,416
You better be.

189
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,458
What is it?

190
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,291
Where are they?

191
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,000
Harder!

192
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,375
Oh my God!

193
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,500
Oh my… Oh my God!

194
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,125
Hey.

195
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,875
- Um… what are you doing?
- Three guesses.

196
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,208
Hey, careful.

197
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,666
You don't wanna corrupt her virgin ears.

198
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,125
We have to get everything together
for Color War. And you guys…

199
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,791
uh, uh… have to finish cleaning
the outhouse.

200
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:29,416
We're doing the shit jobs all summer,
now we have to clean up actual shit? No.

201
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,375
- I'm sorry, but we don't have a choice.
- Shit.

202
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,708
This is our last one, babe.

203
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,416
What are you doing?

204
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,375
Three guesses.

205
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,916
This isn't funny. We have a job to do.

206
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,291
- Alice, put that down.
- Or what?

207
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,208
What, are you gonna snitch on me again?

208
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:59,500
OK. What if you go talk
to your little friend Nurse Lane.

209
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,500
- About getting us some yellow jackets.
- Yes.

210
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,583
- Or some red birds.
- Both.

211
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,708
And then we'll scrub
all the shit you want.

212
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,583
- Yellow jackets, red… What?
- Drugs, baby. Drugs.

213
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,083
- Just hook us up.
- No!

214
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,208
No, I won't do that!

215
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,708
Some people want to do things
with their lives.

216
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,416
So stop screwing with mine
and just do your jobs, please!

217
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,625
Maybe you should have thought about that

218
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,958
before blasting Captain and Tennille
for two hours straight.

219
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,250
Snitch.

220
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,625
Bye!

221
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,250
Hey!

222
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,708
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over.

223
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,833
Your sister…

224
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,500
Cindy Berman, that smell better be skunk.

225
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,000
What about my sister?

226
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,333
Nurse Lane! Hello!

227
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,291
I'm in trouble again. Help.

228
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,375
Nurse Lane, come on!
I could die any minute now.

229
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,458
Nurse Lane?

230
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,041
Nurse Lane?

231
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,916
- What are you doing?
- Oh my God!

232
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,958
Nurse Lane, you scared the shit out of me.

233
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:48,916
Are you OK?

234
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,416
I am. Oh my goodness.

235
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,458
Ziggy, Ziggy, Ziggy.

236
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,333
What did we do now?

237
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:04,333
OK, so you are gonna apply this
once a day for three days. OK?

238
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,500
It's gonna protect against infection.

239
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,500
It's gross.

240
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,750
You'll survive.

241
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,208
So, um… what's the Witch's Mark?

242
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,250
You know about my daughter, right?
Ruby Lane?

243
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,458
Uh…

244
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,875
- I don't...
- Of course you do.

245
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,583
Everybody talks, I know.

246
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,916
Tell me, what do they say?

247
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,833
Uh, um… They say she, uh…

248
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,000
she killed people…

249
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
at a party.

250
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,583
- Seven, seven friends.
- Eight.

251
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,000
She killed herself that night too.

252
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,333
So eight.

253
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,250
Ruby was such a sweet girl.

254
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,916
Oh, and she had a sweet voice.
She was in choir.

255
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,666
She wanted to be a singer.

256
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,500
I was so proud of her.

257
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,750
So proud.

258
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,291
The doctors say
it was a psychotic episode,

259
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,250
that she just snapped.

260
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,750
But the kids…

261
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,166
the kids say Sarah Fier made her do it.

262
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,125
That's a little tight.

263
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,541
- What do you think?
- I don't...

264
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,583
'Cause I think you don't go
from being a sweet girl with dreams

265
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,333
to ripping someone's insides out
with a switchblade.

266
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,291
- Nurse Lane!
- People usually kill for a reason,

267
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,416
and sometimes that reason is justified.

268
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,375
Sometimes killing isn't murder.

269
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,875
- Sometimes it's necessary.
- That's hurting me.

270
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,750
- Sometimes it is good.
- Nurse Lane!

271
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,041
Once a day for three days, OK?

272
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,416
Hi, Nurse Lane.

273
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,541
Hi, Cindy.

274
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,125
Ziggy.

275
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,875
You realize what happens
if you get kicked out, right?

276
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,625
- How awful that would be for me?
- Did someone do something to Nurse Lane?

277
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,541
Like make fun of her daughter?

278
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,208
- Ziggy, are you listening to me?
- She was upset.

279
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,458
I don't care! I…

280
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,000
- Do you hear what I'm saying to you?
- Loud and clear, ma'am.

281
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:17,125
You don't, we had this conversation
last week and the week before that.

282
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,083
- I'm not gonna get kicked out.
- That's not what Kurt thinks.

283
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,791
- Yeah, well, Kurt can suck it.
- No! Ziggy, no!

284
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,750
If you get kicked out, I do too.

285
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,750
Mom can't work and take care of you.
Then how will I pay for college, huh?

286
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,833
Oh, that's funny to you?

287
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,708
Yeah, kinda.

288
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,708
Explain to me what's so funny.

289
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,916
How dumb you are?

290
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,000
No one gets out of this town,
not even Miss Perfect.

291
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,041
Bet on your way out
you get run over by a bus.

292
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:48,083
Once in your life,
could you just not be so… so mean?

293
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,416
Could once in your life
you just stop pretending?

294
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,375
You're Shadyside, in case you forgot.

295
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,333
I swear to God
everyone just wants to ruin my life.

296
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,833
Alice just, like…
She just won't let it go.

297
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,458
It's like we're still 12 years old
and her whole goal in life is to…

298
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,958
to punish me for something
that wasn't even my fault.

299
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,000
I can't believe
you guys used to be friends.

300
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,541
And Ziggy…

301
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,375
It's only a matter of time
before she ends up in jail or worse.

302
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,416
I'm trying to be a good role model
and make something of myself.

303
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,041
But no, no,
I'm the stuck-up priss who hates fun,

304
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,708
which isn't even true at all.
I like fun. I like fun!

305
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,666
I just… I just want
to get out of Shadyside. Is that so crazy?

306
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,000
Shit!

307
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,250
Shit!

308
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,166
Did Cindy Berman just swear?

309
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,708
Not now, Tommy! Not in the mood!

310
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,041
It's OK.

311
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,791
You're OK. You're OK.

312
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,125
Just…

313
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,083
…breathe.

314
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,500
Tommy, is that you?

315
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,791
Tommy?

316
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,958
Tommy, what are you doing? You're really…

317
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,041
…freaking me out.

318
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,625
What is it, babe?

319
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,750
- Nurse Lane?
- I'm sorry.

320
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,666
But I can't save you.

321
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,625
I saw your name.

322
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,041
I saw it on the wall.

323
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,541
One way or another,

324
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,500
you're gonna die tonight.

325
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,083
What are you talking about?

326
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:38,791
You got history with her?
She had a grudge against you?

327
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,291
No grudge. No, we barely ever talked.

328
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,166
I… I go to get bug spray from her.
That's it.

329
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,375
It just doesn't…
it doesn't make any sense.

330
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,250
Why… why would she do something like this?

331
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:53,375
- She was nuts, just like her kid.
- Nurse Lane, she never seemed crazy.

332
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:57,208
That's what she said about her kid, but
sane people don't chop up their friends.

333
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,416
Now, tell me again what happened.

334
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,583
Um… uh…
she… she came into the kitchen…

335
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,708
Hey, witch. So sorry.

336
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,500
I know you and Nurse Psycho were close.

337
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,500
- You can visit her in jail now.
- Fuck off, Sheila.

338
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,958
By the way,

339
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,000
you might want to check your stuff.

340
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,958
I think there was an accident
in cabin five.

341
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,333
- Look at her!
- Hurry, witch! Run!

342
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
Hey, Nicky.

343
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,333
Officer Kapinski.

344
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,708
Been meaning to say I'm sorry
about your Pops. He was a good man.

345
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,833
He was a great man. Taken too soon.

346
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,541
Thank you. Yeah. We all miss him.
Big boots to fill.

347
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:44,041
Well, he was at peace, knowing one day
you'd be following in his footsteps.

348
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,125
Sheriff Nick Goode's got
a good ring to it.

349
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,083
You just go easy on me
when you're my boss, huh?

350
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:01,625
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

351
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,041
<i>But I can't save you.</i>

352
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:08,208
<i>One way or another,
you're gonna die tonight.</i>

353
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:12,708
Hey, guys! Dinner time!

354
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,541
Hey! Hey, come on!

355
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,583
- Nurse Lane's daughter killed 7 people.
- Her daughter was Ruby Lane.

356
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:26,500
She was clearly possessed…
just like her crazy daughter.

357
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,125
Sarah Fier strikes again.

358
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,708
- How does the witch choose them?
- It's crazy.

359
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,625
- Is Color War gonna be canceled?
- It starts tonight.

360
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,958
Psycho Shadysiders
always fucking ruin everything!

361
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,000
She said one way or another,
I was gonna die tonight.

362
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,166
Spooky!

363
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,958
The kiddos are right.
That's, like, totally witchy behavior.

364
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:50,166
It's just, there must be some explanation.
The witch isn't real.

365
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,291
- Like what?
- Well, maybe…

366
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,583
Maybe she was on something.

367
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:59,916
Drugs are peaceful, not violent.

368
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,791
I'm not talking about marijuana.

369
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:07,750
Just admit you're jealous that the witch
wanted your hubby all to herself!

370
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:11,375
Be serious, man. Why would Nurse Mary
wanna do something like that?

371
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:14,500
- Why would she want me dead?
- Oh, no. She wouldn't.

372
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:16,625
But the witch might!

373
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:20,708
Hey, they're just playing around.

374
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,000
This was nothing, I promise.

375
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,416
Did you see her eyes?

376
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:28,083
There was something in there,
something wrong.

377
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:33,500
Alright!

378
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,166
Chicks, dicks, listen up!

379
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,708
We had a scary situation earlier,
but we cannot let that mess

380
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:43,041
with the most important night
of our summer.

381
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:47,833
Tonight is Sunnyvale versus Shadyside.

382
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:51,583
It is red versus blue.
It is good versus evil.

383
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:56,166
Tonight, we commencicate Color War!

384
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,041
It's "commence." My god.

385
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:03,166
He might be dumb,
but he's kind of shagadelic.

386
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,375
- Oh yeah!
- He's disgusting. You're disgusting.

387
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:10,541
Tonight's first event
is Capture the Flag, baby.

388
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,125
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Now, Sunnyvalers…

389
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:16,041
We have never, ever…

390
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,625
…lost a Color War!

391
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,333
Sunnyvale!

392
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:22,208
So let's not let tonight

393
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,625
be a stain on our legacy.

394
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,208
<i>Sunnyvale!</i>

395
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,451
And let's go out there

396
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,958
like our ancestors before us

397
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:36,041
and murder those Shadyside witches!

398
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,250
- Yeah!
- Woo!

399
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,333
Uh, hi!

400
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,625
Thank you, Kurt, for that neat-o speech.

401
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:48,750
Now, Shadysiders,

402
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:53,250
let's go out there and do our best,

403
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,416
because even if we lose,

404
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,250
we're still winners in our hearts.

405
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,750
Boo!

406
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,041
Boo!

407
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:06,583
<i>Sunnyvale! Sunnyvale!</i>

408
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:16,833
What are you doing?

409
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,125
Art project.

410
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:21,500
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm not in the mood.

411
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,875
Earlier, you said Mary was upset.

412
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,875
- Oh, so now you care!
- Ziggy, this is serious.

413
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:29,583
It was serious earlier,
and you didn't give a shit.

414
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:35,583
Come on, you were the last person
to see her before she snapped.

415
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,625
What about drugs? Did you see any around?

416
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:40,833
She's a nurse, so yup.

417
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:43,750
- Well, did she mention anything or...
- Nope.

418
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:46,958
Ziggy, I'm just… I'm trying to understand
what happened today.

419
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,000
Who cares? It's over.

420
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:53,583
Not for Tommy. He's still
freaked out and acting weird and…

421
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:57,125
It's just a big joke to everyone.
"Mary was possessed by the witch."

422
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,083
- Maybe it was the witch.
- Ziggy…

423
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:02,875
What? That doesn't fit your carefully
constructed bullshit view of the world?

424
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,750
- Why are you being like this?
- I dunno.

425
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:07,353
Maybe because Nurse Lane was
the only person who was nice to me,

426
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:11,208
and now her life is over because
bad things always happen to Shadysiders.

427
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,541
Nothing just happens.
There's always a reason.

428
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,000
Not always a rational one.
Deep down, you feel it, don't you?

429
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:21,708
Shadyside, there's something here.
It's just holding us down, cursing us.

430
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:24,375
- Ziggy, that's enough.
- You're too scared to admit it.

431
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,166
When things go bad,
you wanna explain it away.

432
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:31,041
I'm sorry. I'm not going to blame
everything on some fairy tale.

433
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:35,041
Life sucks sometimes. I get that.
I mean, God knows it's been hard since…

434
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,458
Since what?

435
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,416
See, you can't even say it!

436
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,958
Since Dad left.

437
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,875
Since Mom started drinking.

438
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,791
Since we're going to lose the house.

439
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,875
And it's not gonna magically get better.

440
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:51,541
And saving up all summer to buy
a super cute polo shirt can't hide that.

441
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:57,583
Trying to explain why nice old Nurse Lane
almost lost it today can't either.

442
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,083
We're all cursed.

443
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:01,250
For Mary, it was today.

444
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,416
But someday, it'll be you.

445
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,416
And this whole fake
bullshit life of yours,

446
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
it's gonna come crashing down.

447
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,583
That's a horrible thing to say.

448
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,833
It's not horrible if it's true.

449
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,958
I don't know who you are anymore, but…

450
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,916
But you're not my sister.

451
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:22,875
Then who am I?

452
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,458
A monster.

453
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:30,791
That's what they say.

454
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:04,541
Do… do not let them anywhere near this.
Do you hear me?

455
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:05,666
Yeah!

456
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,333
I said, do you hear me?

457
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:09,833
Yeah!

458
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,458
<i>Shadyside! Shadyside!</i>

459
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,875
Alright, alright, alright!

460
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:21,916
Now remember, keep at least
three defenders by this all the time.

461
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,625
Alright? And who's the jailer?

462
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:27,666
OK, Jeremy, you may be
the most important player in the, uh…

463
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:30,208
in the…

464
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,500
<i>Tommy…</i>

465
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,791
- Tommy!
<i>- Sunnyvale!</i>

466
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,875
<i>- Sunnyvale!</i>
- Are you OK?

467
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:42,500
Yeah, are you OK, Mr. Slater?

468
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,500
Yeah, I'm… I'm good. Um…

469
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,750
Why don't you guys get started?
Plant the flag.

470
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:51,500
And I'll be right behind you. OK?
Let's go, Shadyside! Come on!

471
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,863
<i>Shadyside! Shadyside!</i>

472
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:54,125
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

473
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,250
Oh, man.

474
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:59,541
My head is throbbing.
She must have got me pretty good.

475
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:03,291
- Mary's stronger than she looks.
- You need to lie down?

476
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,125
No. No, I'm alright. I'm alright.

477
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,666
Good. I need your help,

478
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,958
and the key to the infirmary.

479
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,083
So, what exactly
are we looking for?

480
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Answers.

481
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,083
Come on, Cindy.
It doesn't matter, alright?

482
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,625
It matters.

483
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:48,500
There's a reason Mary did what she did
and said what she said.

484
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:51,666
- We're going to figure it out now.
- Come on, Cindy. Please, I…

485
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,791
No label, half-empty.

486
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:08,500
Like I said, she was on drugs.

487
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:12,416
Get these to the cops,
then they'll tell us what they…

488
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:14,916
What is that?

489
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,708
"A deal was made with the Devil."

490
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:21,041
"Sarah Fier cut off her wicked hand

491
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:24,791
on Satan's stone
in exchange for eternal life,

492
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,500
scarring the soil beneath
with the witch's mark,

493
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,416
bringing Darkness upon the land."

494
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,416
Did you hear that?

495
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:50,666
Hello?

496
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hello, is somebody in there?
- Argh!
- Jeez!

497
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,333
Come on. That's not funny.

498
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:04,791
Alice? What are you doing here?

499
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:07,625
Looks like we're both here
for the same thing.

500
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,291
Must really want me
to scrub those toilets.

501
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:12,666
This isn't for you.

502
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,833
Whoa, Berman. I didn't know
you were into that kind of thing.

503
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:19,000
They're not for me.
I'm giving them to the cops.

504
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:20,250
Oh yeah, the cops.

505
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,250
Yeah, right, of course.

506
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:26,541
No, what are you talking about?
What, now you're gonna snitch on Mary too?

507
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,750
No. That's… I'm trying to...

508
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:31,125
- This for the cops too?
- Give that back!

509
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:36,375
"She emerged by the Meeting House,

510
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:39,833
one hand severed, lost forever."

511
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:41,791
"We hanged the witch,

512
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:43,500
body chained and buried

513
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,041
but without her hand,

514
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:48,791
her grip on the land holds firm."

515
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,166
Ooh!

516
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:52,500
This is Sarah Fier shit!

517
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,708
Alice, come on.

518
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:57,125
"When she is near, blood will fall

519
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:02,250
and the curse will last
until body and hand unite."

520
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:05,291
Alice, it's Mary's diary.
Let's put it back.

521
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:07,000
It's not just a diary.

522
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:10,958
It's a map.

523
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:12,541
What?

524
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,416
Crazy Nurse Lane made a crazy map.

525
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,250
It's camp,
but looks like she drew all over it.

526
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:26,208
1666 Union.

527
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,416
- Union, that's Shadyside.
- What?

528
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,875
The settlement before it was divided
into Shadyside and Sunnyvale.

529
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,041
- Really?
- If you went to class…

530
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:37,208
So, the camp is built in the same place
as the settlement?

531
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,750
Whoa, look, look, look! Sarah Fier!

532
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:43,916
- Do you think that's her house?
- What are all the X's?

533
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,416
There's only one way to find out.

534
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,583
Hey! That's my bag!

535
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:50,666
Arnie, flashlight.

536
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,375
- What is this shit?
- Let me see.

537
00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:59,041
L484.

538
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:03,166
- Sounds familiar. Ooh, Dex, maybe.
- Know what sounds fun?

539
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:06,708
- Seeing a witch's house high on Dex.
- Oh yes, it does.

540
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:10,458
Alice! Bring that back!
What are you doing?

541
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:14,083
It's called fun, Cindy Berman.
You used to have it, remember?

542
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:16,791
- We're gonna find you, Sarah Fier!
- Tommy!

543
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:20,208
<i>Tommy…</i>

544
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,458
Tommy!

545
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,541
Come on, they took everything!

546
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,916
Go away, Cindy!

547
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,875
It's me. It's Nick.

548
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,875
Go away, Nick!

549
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,541
Whoa.

550
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,833
- I like what you've done with the place.
- This wasn't me.

551
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:48,916
I'm shocked.

552
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,583
"Ziggy is a witch bitch."

553
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:54,875
"Ziggy sucks cocks in Hell." Jeez.

554
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,166
Sheila?

555
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:58,708
Colonel Mustard.

556
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:04,250
- Oh, looks like blood.
- Yeah. I didn't have a pig, so…

557
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,458
<i>Carrie.</i> Cool.

558
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,375
You've read <i>Carrie?</i>

559
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,916
Yeah. Second favorite after <i>Salem's Lot.</i>

560
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,833
Still, I dunno,
paint seems a little pedestrian.

561
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,916
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have a better idea?

562
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,416
Maybe.

563
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,875
Shouldn't you be, like,
turning me in or something?

564
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:26,541
Well, I should be supervising
Color War, uh…

565
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,333
- But noticed you were MIA and...
- So you decided to stalk me.

566
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,166
Check in on you.

567
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,208
Clearly you don't need my assistance.
All good. Go ahead.

568
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,375
"Carrie" on.

569
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,875
What's your idea?

570
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,583
Science & Nature.

571
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,625
Alice!

572
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:53,541
Alice!

573
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:57,000
Come on, it's disgusting in here!

574
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,791
We're close,
Berman, hang in there!

575
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:03,125
This was the best idea.

576
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:06,166
Yeah, but I still don't feel shit.

577
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,708
OK, so, take more.

578
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,416
Thank you.

579
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,083
L484.

580
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,458
- Arnie!
- Wait up!

581
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,541
Alice!

582
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,916
I swear to God…

583
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:22,541
Shit!

584
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,000
- Oh, it's ruined now!
- You cursed again.

585
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:27,833
You want me to murder you?

586
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:29,958
- Babe, you OK?
- Yeah.

587
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,875
Yeah, I'm fine.

588
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:35,000
Alice?

589
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:48,666
Watch your step.

590
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,833
Is someone digging a grave?

591
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,375
Graves.

592
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,375
Mary.

593
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:03,875
Hey, where's the, uh…

594
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,500
The X's, look. Look.

595
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,583
Look, here. Here.

596
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,166
She was marking where she dug.

597
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,791
"But without her hand,

598
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:22,166
her grip on the land holds firm

599
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,041
and the curse will last
until body and hand unite."

600
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,708
Maybe Mary was looking for the hand.

601
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,958
- To end the curse?
- That made her daughter lose her mind.

602
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,083
Guys, come on.

603
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,125
- This is silly.
- Yeah.

604
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,083
I gotta piss.

605
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,791
Hey, let me see that.

606
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,250
You can have it,

607
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,916
but first give me the drugs.

608
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,541
L484,

609
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,666
L484,

610
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,291
L4…

611
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,458
…84.

612
00:38:56,833 --> 00:39:00,750
If Nurse Mary took them and went crazy,
those drugs are very dangerous.

613
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,708
Oh my God!

614
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,291
What happened to you?

615
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,291
You remember when we used to have fun?

616
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,916
- Before you became a snitch?
- Just let it go already.

617
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,375
That's easy for you to say.

618
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:15,791
- You lying fucking Brutus.
- I found it!

619
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,000
I found the witch's house.

620
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,333
Dude…

621
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:30,083
Was I the only one expecting, like,
I dunno, a house made out of candy?

622
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,686
Maybe there's candy down here.

623
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,041
Whoa!

624
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,083
Hey, Sarah,
you got any candy down there?

625
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,333
We're high and hungry.

626
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,041
- Sarah Fier!
- OK, we've seen enough.

627
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,958
Alright then, go home, Berman.

628
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,166
I didn't march all the way out here
for nothing, OK?

629
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,166
Are you crazy? Alice!

630
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,458
Alice!

631
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,208
Hey, someone's been down here.

632
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,333
Like, recently.

633
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,166
Look at all this witchy shit.

634
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,208
It's Sarah Fier!

635
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,750
Sarah Fier isn't real.

636
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,708
Well, someone lit that candle.

637
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,000
Hey, Sarah Fier, if you're in here,
say something!

638
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,583
Maybe she's shy.

639
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,166
Ali… Alice! God!

640
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,041
Whoa!

641
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:11,750
It's some kind of, like, occult thing…

642
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,833
Like Devil worship.

643
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,958
- It's kinky.
- Oh, yeah.

644
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,333
It's the witch's mark.

645
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,250
The what?

646
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,375
"A deal was made with the Devil."

647
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:32,708
"Sarah Fier cut off her wicked hand
on Satan's stone

648
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,708
in exchange for eternal life,

649
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:38,500
scarring the soil beneath
with the witch's mark,

650
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,083
bringing Darkness upon the land."

651
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,250
That's it.

652
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,125
It's acetaminophen.

653
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:46,875
- Arnie, what are you talking about?
- L484.

654
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:51,125
It just hit me. It's fucking Tylenol.
It's nothing.

655
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,375
Are you sure?

656
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:53,458
Positive.

657
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
Come on, Alice.
Let's get out of here.

658
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:01,833
Pretty sure Joan might still have
some weed if we pay her.

659
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,333
We are out of here.

660
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,250
Let's go, man.

661
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:22,416
Hey, you alright, man?

662
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Hello?

663
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,375
Hello?

664
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,000
<i>Cindy.</i>

665
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>Cindy!</i>

666
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,500
- I need to show you something.
- This place…

667
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,916
- It keeps on going.
- Now!

668
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,500
Cyrus Miller.

669
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,625
Billy Barker. Ruby Lane.

670
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,750
- Mary's daughter.
- Yeah.

671
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,708
Isaac Milton, Harry Rooker.

672
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:12,250
You don't have to go to fucking class
to know those names.

673
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,333
- The Shadyside Killers.
- Yeah.

674
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:16,958
Except one.

675
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:25,500
Tommy? Alice, this isn't funny.

676
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:29,916
What, you think I carved your boyfriend's
name into solid stone with my fingernails?

677
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:31,916
Someone else did this.

678
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:38,541
<i>Tommy.</i>

679
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,583
Hello?

680
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,333
Whatever you're on, man,
thanks for sharing.

681
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:49,916
Dick.

682
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,250
Tommy?

683
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,500
What the hell are you doing, man? Tommy…

684
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:08,208
Oh my God! No, no, Tommy! Stop!

685
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:09,625
Tommy, stop!

686
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:16,583
- Come on! Come on!
- Fuck!

687
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:21,291
Here.

688
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:22,916
Help me.

689
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,333
Go, go, go!

690
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,708
No! No!

691
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,166
Do you hear that?

692
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,041
He's still alive?

693
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:16,750
He can't… He can't get us.

694
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:22,125
He can't get us.

695
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:53,333
Get in jail, Shadyside trash!

696
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,708
You're property of Sunnyvale now!

697
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:59,666
You move, you speak, you fucking die!

698
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,750
Go!

699
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:02,416
Sheila.

700
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:03,958
From Will.

701
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:38,833
Will! This is too cute.

702
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:42,041
Could have done it in your bunk,
but I guess this is kind of hot.

703
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:07,000
Please somebody help me!

704
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,916
Help me! Somebody help me! Please!

705
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:20,083
- Did you hear her?
- She sounded like a frog.

706
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:23,416
- What'd I tell ya?
- Fuck paint.

707
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,583
Fuck paint.

708
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:27,916
Who are you?

709
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:29,625
Nick Goode.

710
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:33,750
Nice to meet you.

711
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:36,875
It's some kind of cavern.

712
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:39,625
I don't know. It seems to just…

713
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:41,958
go on forever.

714
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:43,166
I don't care.

715
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:49,458
Alice, can you please just…

716
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:51,916
help me?

717
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,083
What, you're just gonna pretend
that everything's OK?

718
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,500
Alice, I just…

719
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:04,541
Tommy split Arnie's head in half.

720
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,208
Do you realize that?

721
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,875
- Please, can you just help me?
- With what?

722
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:14,916
This shit weighs, like, a million pounds.
I thought you got an A in physics.

723
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,375
We have to get out!

724
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,625
Well, tough shit.

725
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:19,541
Because we can't.

726
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:22,041
We're gonna die down here.

727
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:24,125
Just like Arnie.

728
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,666
No, no. We have to get out!

729
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:31,875
We have to!

730
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:35,416
Those names on the wall,
they didn't stop with one murder.

731
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,833
Seven, nine, ten, fifteen people.

732
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,458
Those were serial killers.

733
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:41,750
The campers…

734
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:45,583
My… my sister, they're up there.

735
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,541
And now, so is he.

736
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:51,458
I thought you didn't believe in the witch.

737
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:52,916
Yeah, I don't! I…

738
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,208
The… There must be some… some explanation.

739
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:58,958
Oh my God,
you are fucking unbelievable, Cindy. OK?

740
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:00,416
He was possessed!

741
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,125
- Maybe… Maybe he took a pill or...
- No!

742
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:06,208
No! Cindy, no!
It wasn't the fucking Tylenol, alright?

743
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:07,916
It was the witch.

744
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,083
Alright, you saw those names.

745
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:11,666
And that… that ritual,

746
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:14,208
the witch is real.

747
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:18,000
And she's doing some…
some fucking spell shit

748
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,791
and possessing people.

749
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,833
OK? Every name on that rock.

750
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:24,541
And Mary knew it, alright?

751
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:26,916
She knew it. And it's all right here.

752
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,583
This isn't real!

753
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,000
You want an explanation?

754
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:34,333
Well, here it is. OK?

755
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,916
She looked for the hand bone
to fucking stop the curse,

756
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,958
to save Shadyside,
but she couldn't find it.

757
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:40,625
Wanna know what she did find?

758
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,916
Your boyfriend's name
in that fucking wall.

759
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,833
No.

760
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:47,458
- So she tried to kill him.
- Stop.

761
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:49,166
Which I also would've done,

762
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:52,250
if I knew there was a chance
that Tommy fucking Slater

763
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:55,833
would ax my boyfriend in the fucking head!

764
00:49:55,916 --> 00:49:57,708
Listen! Shut up!

765
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:00,208
There we go.

766
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,125
That's the Cindy Berman I knew.

767
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:06,833
Hey, where are you going?

768
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:08,375
To find another way out.

769
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,166
Don't follow me.

770
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,291
Don't come back here, alright?

771
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:15,791
Alright, do you hear me?
Don't come back!

772
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:21,791
<i>Cindy…</i>

773
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You're fine, you're fine.
Boo!

774
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:40,916
Jesus, what the hell?
I told you not to follow me.

775
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,333
Yeah, I didn't.

776
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,416
You went in a circle.

777
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:47,166
Fucking circle.

778
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:04,916
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

779
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,750
One, two, three, four.

780
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,666
- What are you doing?
- Four.

781
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,750
This symbol, it branches off here.
Four times.

782
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:14,375
Three there, one there.

783
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:15,916
Just like this cave.

784
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,208
It's the same.

785
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,541
"Sarah Fier cut off her wicked hand
on Satan's stone,

786
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:23,416
scarring the soil beneath
with the witch's mark."

787
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,791
"Scarring the soil."

788
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,208
So, what, like, the witch
made this fucking place?

789
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:31,791
Or the settlers claimed she did.
It doesn't matter.

790
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:34,666
- All that matters is this symbol. It's a...
- It's a map.

791
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:49,833
Can I, uh… get you a water
or a juice box maybe?

792
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:50,916
We're fine.

793
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:56,958
Cool. Yeah, I just thought, you know,
since we're all in here and in jail

794
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:59,750
that you might want
some refreshments, but, uh…

795
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:03,250
Or we can, uh… We can… We can…
Well, we can play a game.

796
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,041
Do you guys like, uh, Charades...

797
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,500
Shut the fuck up, nerd.

798
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,041
Yeah, OK. Sure. Um…

799
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,333
Sunnyvalers,

800
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,500
these inmates are property of Shadyside.

801
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:40,458
If you… If you don't leave,
I… I'll be forced to get you.

802
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,291
Hey, nerd!

803
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,291
No. Hey, hey, hey!
That's not fair!

804
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:52,875
Come on! Go, go!

805
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:54,791
- Run, run!
- No, no, no, no.

806
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:56,000
Go, go, go!

807
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:57,625
Man…

808
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

809
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,375
Tommy?

810
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:21,583
Alright, next question.

811
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:24,250
Uh…

812
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:27,291
What about you and your sister?
You guys ever get along?

813
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,958
Thought these were supposed to be
easy questions.

814
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:30,916
Says who?

815
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,291
There are no rules to this game.

816
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:35,458
God, I hate snakes.

817
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:37,208
Why are you dodging my question?

818
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:38,958
Why do you care?

819
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:40,083
I'm curious.

820
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:44,666
- I've hated her since I was a baby. Next.
- Come on.

821
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,875
Why are you so full of shit?

822
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,000
What?

823
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:50,208
Nick Goode,

824
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,000
heir apparent,

825
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:55,125
Daddy was the police chief,
the King of Sunnyvale,

826
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:56,375
you're gonna be the same.

827
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:58,083
Except it's all make-believe.

828
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:04,166
The truth is you like Stephen King
and spiders and…

829
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:07,291
the weird girl from Shadyside.

830
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:08,958
Alright, first of all,

831
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:12,666
Stephen King is, like, super popular.

832
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,333
And, second,

833
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:17,375
I can't like the weird girl.

834
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:18,750
Why not?

835
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:21,000
Because I'm a counselor.

836
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:22,333
She's a camper.

837
00:54:22,416 --> 00:54:24,458
Last year for me. First year for you.

838
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:29,833
Plus, how will I ever get to know her
when she keeps dodging my questions?

839
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:44,000
There was a time
when things were good between us.

840
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:47,333
When my dad was around
and my mom was happy,

841
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:49,208
and my sister and me, we would, um…

842
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:52,625
we'd throw toilet paper
on Mr. Corkle's tree,

843
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:55,375
and then go jump in the lake
in all our clothes and…

844
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:58,458
And now…

845
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,791
Now it's just gone and everything's shit.

846
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:07,541
That's what happens
when you live in Shadyside.

847
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:10,083
Everything turns to shit eventually.

848
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,333
But I wouldn't expect
a Sunnyvaler to understand.

849
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:19,458
No, maybe you're right.

850
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:23,833
But, uh… being the heir apparent
isn't always easy either.

851
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:25,791
Before he died,

852
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:29,416
my dad loaded me up with all this,

853
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,458
you know, "You're my legacy,

854
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:34,083
the future of the family
depends on you" shit.

855
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:39,916
You know, he just dropped
this huge burden in my lap and…

856
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,875
I dunno, what if I don't want that?

857
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,958
What if that's not who I want to be?

858
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:49,541
What if I want to be the kid
who likes spiders and Stephen King and...

859
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:51,625
And the weird girl from Shadyside?

860
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:55,375
Yeah.

861
00:55:57,708 --> 00:55:59,291
The weird girl from Shadyside.

862
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:01,958
But, uh…

863
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:05,041
I guess there's nothing I can do about it.

864
00:56:05,541 --> 00:56:06,541
Why not?

865
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:13,375
Yeah, you were right. Can we, uh…
Can we go back to the easy questions?

866
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:15,791
OK.

867
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:19,583
Um…

868
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:21,583
How about…

869
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:45,416
He's dead!

870
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,208
- Jeremy's dead!
- No, you guys! OK? Hey!

871
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:51,541
We're done. Everyone get back.
Hey, no! Color War's done! Alright?

872
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:54,083
Get out of here! Get out!

873
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:56,125
Let's go! Get out! Let's go!

874
00:56:56,833 --> 00:57:00,625
Alright, it branches off again here.
Just stay left.

875
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:05,041
I cannot believe this is working.

876
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:08,708
It's taking too long.
He could be back at camp already.

877
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:12,416
If you have to kill him…

878
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:13,916
could you?

879
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:17,916
Earlier, when Mary attacked, I just…

880
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:22,125
I froze. I couldn't do anything.

881
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:29,958
So, no, I… I couldn't kill anyone,
much less Tommy.

882
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:33,875
Well, good news. I would happily kill him.

883
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,708
God, even now, after everything,
you're… you're still a jerk.

884
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:42,541
OK, I'm sorry. I just…
I never got what you saw in him.

885
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,791
And that was before
the witch possessed him.

886
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:47,708
Tommy…

887
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:50,083
Tommy was sweet.

888
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:52,583
He made me feel like

889
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:55,916
everything was going to be OK.

890
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:58,208
I loved him.

891
00:57:58,291 --> 00:57:59,708
I really did.

892
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:01,208
I loved Arnie too.

893
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:05,083
I loved that gross, high little shit.

894
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:09,666
Do you hear that?

895
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
There's this space here up ahead.

896
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16,083
All roads lead here.

897
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:20,583
Is there any other way around?

898
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:32,916
What the hell?

899
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,750
Flies? What is this stuff?

900
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,000
It's everywhere.

901
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:39,958
Cindy?

902
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:43,083
What is that?

903
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:51,291
Let's get out of here.

904
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:58,166
<i>Alice…</i>

905
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,291
<i>Alice…</i>

906
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Alice!

907
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Alice?

908
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:45,666
Let's go! This is not part of the game!
Go, guys! Go, go!

909
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,916
Five, seven, eight, ten,

910
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,875
fifteen, eighteen…

911
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:56,541
- Stay calm! Everything's alright!
- How many?

912
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:58,916
- Twenty-three.
- That's 30 missing at least.

913
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,833
- Where's Cindy, Kurt, Joan?
- I don't know. I haven't seen them.

914
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:03,375
Or Tommy or anyone.

915
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:06,018
- The lights are coming on!
- Maybe they're looking for us.

916
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:08,500
- It's dead.
- We have to go. We have to warn people.

917
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:11,875
- I'm sure they heard the bell. Hey!
- My sister, she's still out there!

918
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:14,250
The same sister you've hated
since you were a baby?

919
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:16,375
Look, I'm sorry.

920
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:19,125
I didn't mean it. Me and Gary will go.

921
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:21,166
- What?
- Just please stay here.

922
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,458
- I can't sit here!
- I'm not letting you get hurt!

923
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:26,583
- What the hell?
- OK?

924
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:30,125
Please, let me do my job.

925
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:33,250
I'm gonna find your sister.
Just stay here. OK?

926
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,291
- You.
- Hey, you realize that's a camper, right?

927
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:41,166
Look, you make for cabin one.
I'll head to nine.

928
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:44,458
- What if the killer's still out there?
- That's the whole point, Gary.

929
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hey, everybody! Stay here! OK? OK.

930
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:53,541
Hey!

931
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,416
- Where is she, witch?
- You kill her like you killed Jeremy?

932
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,083
- What are you talking about?
- Sheila!

933
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:00,250
Where the fuck is Sheila?

934
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:03,041
Shit!

935
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:07,458
Nick! Nick, we forgot Sheila!

936
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:10,958
Shit!

937
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:17,833
Cindy!

938
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:19,333
Kurt!

939
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:22,333
Alice!

940
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,250
Joan!

941
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:27,000
Fuck.

942
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,250
Where the fuck is everyone?

943
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:36,416
Stay put, big boy.

944
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:40,791
Oh, yeah. Oh!

945
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:52,625
You tell anyone about this,
and you're dead.

946
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,541
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

947
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:02,083
Just admit that Shadysiders do it better.

948
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,375
I ain't admitting shit.

949
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:06,166
He knows.

950
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Yes.

951
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:34,125
Joan, I can smell that shit
from here! Put it out!

952
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,041
You know, you Sunnyvalers
are really missing out.

953
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:40,041
This shit, like, really…

954
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:43,250
opens up your mind.

955
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:44,416
Put it out!

956
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Okie dokie!

957
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,500
Tommy!

958
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:37,541
Alice!

959
01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:38,625
Jesus!

960
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,458
I was there, in the past.

961
01:03:41,541 --> 01:03:43,958
- You're OK.
- I saw the… the killers.

962
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,250
They killed so many and you're next.

963
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:47,875
You're fucking next!

964
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:50,916
No, no, no, no.
That's not true. I'm right here.

965
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,333
The witch did this.

966
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:56,458
She did all of this. She put a curse
on Shadyside. Mary was right.

967
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,541
I know.

968
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,208
The cave was alive, Alice.

969
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,125
Tylenol can't do that.

970
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:10,000
You were right.

971
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:12,791
I am a snitch.

972
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,625
The day after we stole
Mr. Evans's JVC player,

973
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,375
Harold Hines saw me with it.

974
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:21,000
Fucking Harold Hines.

975
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:27,500
Next thing I know,
I'm in the Principal's office,

976
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:29,333
and my dad can't come in

977
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:33,208
because he just ran off with some girl
not much older than I am now.

978
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:38,250
And my mom, well, she was having
a few drinks at O'Connell's.

979
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,708
And I knew then…

980
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:43,250
I wasn't different
from the other Shadysiders.

981
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:45,750
I was cursed.

982
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:49,375
I told myself if I was perfect,

983
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:51,291
if I did everything right,

984
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:52,916
I could beat it.

985
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:55,041
I snitched on you,

986
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:57,250
I got new friends, I…

987
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:00,500
started dressing like this.

988
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:07,333
I dated sweet Tommy.

989
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:10,708
I avoided you,

990
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:12,916
but I couldn't avoid Ziggy.

991
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:19,125
Because she was always there,
reminding me of the truth.

992
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:21,291
That this town, this place…

993
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:24,166
…was cursed.

994
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:27,583
And so were we.

995
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:29,875
Now I know.

996
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:31,833
She was right…

997
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,916
all this time.

998
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,125
I've been a bad sister.

999
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:44,250
I've been a bad friend.

1000
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:47,833
I should've just…

1001
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:51,750
skipped class, partied, had sex, had fun.

1002
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:53,541
I hate to break it to you,

1003
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:55,500
but the fun…

1004
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:00,958
it's not any more real
than your polo shirt.

1005
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,833
There's a reason I wear these.

1006
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:06,916
And it's not just because they're awesome.

1007
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:17,666
We all have our ways
to deal with Shadyside.

1008
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:25,458
What? What is it?

1009
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:28,541
This.

1010
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:31,791
This moss, it stained my shirt.
The outhouse!

1011
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:39,250
This stuff is all over the outhouse.

1012
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:42,708
Camp.

1013
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:46,250
It means we're close.

1014
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:50,208
Everyone, listen up! The game is over!

1015
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:53,791
Get back to the Mess Hall
or I'll dock you a victory point!

1016
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:59,250
Claire! Freddy! Jesus!

1017
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:02,500
Get to the Mess Hall! Come on! Go!

1018
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,750
Everyone, the game is over!

1019
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:13,291
Get back to the Mess Hall!

1020
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,083
Was that Counselor Goode?

1021
01:07:15,166 --> 01:07:16,791
Hey! I said no talking!

1022
01:07:17,541 --> 01:07:20,000
- He said the game was over!
- No talking, dweeb!

1023
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:23,500
Just stay put.
I'll check with Counselor Goode.

1024
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:26,375
Hey, we need… that.

1025
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:27,458
Hold on.

1026
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,375
Maybe we should just leave.

1027
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Shit!

1028
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1029
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,416
Counselor Tommy?

1030
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:13,666
Oh shit!

1031
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:22,958
Sheila?

1032
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:25,500
Sheila, are you still in here?

1033
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:27,333
Sheila?

1034
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:32,125
You bitch!

1035
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:34,375
Sheila! Listen to me!

1036
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:39,250
Do you smell that?

1037
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,083
Ugh.

1038
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,166
It smells like shit.

1039
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:50,125
- Is that toilet paper?
- It's the outhouse. It's gotta be.

1040
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:56,583
- Holy shit.
- There it is. Look.

1041
01:08:58,458 --> 01:08:59,458
Bitch!

1042
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm trying to help you! There's a killer...
Oh shit!
I heard shouting. What's going...?

1043
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,916
- What's going on in here?
- Is everyone OK?

1044
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,958
No! Everyone's headed back
to the Mess Hall.

1045
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:18,041
Where's Nick?

1046
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:21,666
Help! Help! We're down here! Help!

1047
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,166
Do you hear that?

1048
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,375
Hello?

1049
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:30,333
- Down here!
- Please help us!

1050
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:33,416
- Please, help us!
- Get us out of here!

1051
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,000
- Hey! Hello!
- Help us!

1052
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:37,708
Will you please help us?

1053
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:38,791
Cindy?

1054
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:41,000
Ziggy? Oh my God!

1055
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:43,291
- What are you doing down there?
- It's…

1056
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:47,250
It's kind of a long story.
Are you OK?

1057
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,500
Yeah, hold on a second.

1058
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,750
Ziggy, are you OK?

1059
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:52,458
Are you OK?

1060
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,208
What is going on?

1061
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,625
- My sister's in the toilet.
- What?

1062
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:58,875
Gary! Just help me!

1063
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:02,833
Come on! Go! Back to the Mess Hall,
you hear me? Let's go!

1064
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,416
If anyone's in there, the game's over!

1065
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:25,333
Oh God.

1066
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,083
Oh shit!

1067
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:47,250
Nick! I came out of the bathroom,
she was just dead, man! I swear to God!

1068
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:50,500
Jesus, man.

1069
01:10:51,666 --> 01:10:53,083
Did you do this?

1070
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,958
- Listen, there's a fucking killer.
- What?

1071
01:10:57,041 --> 01:10:59,958
We have to get the others out of here.
Get back to the Mess Hall.

1072
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:02,166
In 15 minutes, ring the bell.

1073
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,916
Ring the bell, that's the signal.

1074
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,625
Get them on the bus,
get them out of here. Alright?

1075
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:07,875
You hear me?

1076
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,625
Just go! Go, Kurt!

1077
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:22,875
- Get on! We're pulling you up!
- Yes!

1078
01:11:23,666 --> 01:11:26,250
- Dude, oh my God.
- Pull it. You first.

1079
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:34,458
Now!

1080
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:57,333
Keep pulling!

1081
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:01,875
Tommy! Tommy, what are you doi…

1082
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:21,500
Ziggy!

1083
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:24,583
- Ziggy!
- Get him off!

1084
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:27,041
- Ziggy! Ziggy!
- Get him off me!

1085
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,833
- Get him off! Get him off!
- Ziggy!

1086
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:34,916
What are you doing?

1087
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,708
- He's here!
- Come on!

1088
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:49,416
- Did we lose him?
- Yeah, I think so. Are you OK? You hurt?

1089
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,916
It's not my blood. It's Gary's.

1090
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:58,416
- And yours?
- Um… Sean, Jesse, Rod, Stacey.

1091
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,291
Shadysiders. It's the curse.

1092
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:03,291
No, it's, uh, it's just some psycho.

1093
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:06,208
No, no, it's not some psycho. It's Tommy.

1094
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:09,916
My sister's perfect, virgin,
boring boyfriend Tommy.

1095
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
She did this.

1096
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,625
- Cindy?
- The witch!

1097
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:16,000
That's not real, Ziggy.

1098
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:18,791
Exactly what Sunnyvaler would say.
I thought you were different.

1099
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:21,875
They're getting on the bus. We have to go!

1100
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:26,083
- I can't! My sister is still out there!
- Ziggy, I've let a lot of people die.

1101
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:29,083
- Nick, this isn't your fault.
- Not you! I'm not letting you die.

1102
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:31,708
Because, uh… yeah!

1103
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:34,041
I do like the weirdo from Shadyside.

1104
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:35,791
Maybe once we get out of this,

1105
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:38,541
we could, uh…
we could start a book club or something.

1106
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:42,541
Maybe… I dunno, Stephen King's new one
is supposed to be good, I hear.

1107
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:45,791
I'm done with King.
Judy Blume for me from now on.

1108
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:49,041
Yeah, Judy Blume sounds, uh…
sounds perfect.

1109
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,291
You believe me, right? About the curse?

1110
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:55,375
Yeah, of course. I am different.

1111
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Now, come on. We gotta get out of here.
We'll call the cops.
Your sister's gonna be alright.
First, we gotta get on that bus.

1112
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Ziggy!

1113
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:44,458
Run.

1114
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:45,583
Aaah! Run!

1115
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:48,666
Run!

1116
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:57,250
Ziggy!

1117
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,291
Ziggy!

1118
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,833
We have to find another way out.

1119
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:06,708
What if there's not?

1120
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:08,500
No, no, there's gotta be.

1121
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:11,250
We're at the outhouse. We're at camp.

1122
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,208
Come on, get the diary. We're too close.

1123
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:19,958
OK, these… these tunnels.

1124
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:23,125
The witch, she made them, right?

1125
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:24,208
Yeah?

1126
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:29,291
And, "She emerged by the Meeting House,

1127
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,625
one hand severed lost forever."

1128
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:34,500
The Meeting House, which is now…

1129
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:37,666
The Mess Hall.

1130
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,833
There's gotta be another way out.

1131
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:42,416
Oh God!

1132
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,791
Come on!

1133
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:45,916
- I'm just gonna slow you down.
- Alice!

1134
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,208
No, it's fine. I'll catch up.
You gotta save your sister.

1135
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:50,125
No…

1136
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:51,208
Go!

1137
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:02,833
Kurt! Will! Anybody!

1138
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:41,125
"Blood will fall…"

1139
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:50,708
"When she is near, blood will fall."

1140
01:17:51,916 --> 01:17:55,333
"Her hand laid to rest
atop Satan's stone."

1141
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,916
Satan's stone…

1142
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,500
Hello?

1143
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:49,166
Can anyone hear me? Hello?

1144
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:53,416
Hello?

1145
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,708
Can anyone hear me? Hello!

1146
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:23,541
Hey! Hey, I'm over here! Help!

1147
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,000
Help!

1148
01:20:52,416 --> 01:20:53,416
Ziggy!

1149
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:54,916
Ziggy!

1150
01:20:58,791 --> 01:20:59,791
No!

1151
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:48,125
No!

1152
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:01,250
Fuck… you!

1153
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:08,833
You swore!

1154
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,291
It's becoming a habit.

1155
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:20,875
You smell like shit.

1156
01:22:20,958 --> 01:22:23,541
- Yeah, that's because I'm covered in it.
- Oh God.

1157
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:28,500
- Do you think it'll wash out?
- You might need to buy a new polo.

1158
01:22:31,416 --> 01:22:32,875
I'm so sorry, Ziggy.

1159
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:38,750
I'm… I'm sorry I wasn't here,
not just tonight, but every day.

1160
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:40,625
No, you were. You just...

1161
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:42,541
No, no. I haven't been here.

1162
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:44,708
I know that now.

1163
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:49,083
I know that you just needed me
to listen, to hear you.

1164
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:53,958
I thought if I just put my head down
and followed the rules,

1165
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:55,958
everything would be fine,

1166
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:58,583
that I'd get out of Shadyside, but…

1167
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:01,625
but now I know you were right.

1168
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:05,041
Everything is cursed.

1169
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:08,500
I could have been nicer.

1170
01:23:09,458 --> 01:23:12,208
I could have been less of a… of a monster.

1171
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:13,708
Yeah. Well…

1172
01:23:16,208 --> 01:23:17,416
You were my monster.

1173
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,541
And at the end of the day, Mom, Dad…

1174
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:24,458
Shadyside, Sunnyvale, I…

1175
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:29,458
I won't let anything pull us apart again.

1176
01:23:29,541 --> 01:23:30,541
You hear me?

1177
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:33,958
Loud and clear, ma'am.

1178
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:01,166
Hey, snitch!

1179
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:03,416
What took you so long?

1180
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:08,291
Come on!

1181
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:19,708
You did it.

1182
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:22,166
We did it.

1183
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:28,208
OK, careful, OK?
This thing's like a million years old.

1184
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:30,166
I bought that a month ago.

1185
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:32,833
No, I'm not talking
about your stupid bag, genius.

1186
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:34,708
"Blood will fall."

1187
01:24:35,708 --> 01:24:38,083
Satan's stone, OK? It was right there.

1188
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:41,750
All this time, buried under the moss,
and I found it.

1189
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,875
I fucking found it.

1190
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:45,333
Found what?

1191
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:47,541
Three guesses.

1192
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:57,916
What? What is it?

1193
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:03,333
It's Sarah Fier's lost hand.

1194
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:07,083
Nurse Lane…

1195
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,500
she spent her entire life
looking for this.

1196
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:14,458
A way to stop the curse
that took her daughter.

1197
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,583
"Without her hand,
her grip on the land holds firm."

1198
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:22,291
"The curse will last

1199
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:25,250
until body and hand unite."

1200
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:27,250
This led us to the hand bone.

1201
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,958
And if the legend is true,
that means her body's still buried...

1202
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:32,791
By the Hanging Tree.

1203
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:34,166
We can end this.

1204
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,875
No more murders, no more curse,

1205
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:37,958
no more…

1206
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:42,375
pain.

1207
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:48,083
We can save Shadyside…

1208
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,250
tonight!

1209
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:07,625
My nose…

1210
01:26:08,708 --> 01:26:10,333
I bled on the hand and…

1211
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,666
I think I just saw her.

1212
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:14,375
Who?

1213
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:16,500
Sarah Fier.

1214
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:18,833
She was…

1215
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:20,833
She was angry.

1216
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:25,083
We have to bury this thing…
right fucking now.

1217
01:27:26,666 --> 01:27:27,958
OK, let's go.

1218
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:30,916
What, I have to use my hands?

1219
01:27:31,416 --> 01:27:32,708
No, you're staying here.

1220
01:27:32,791 --> 01:27:34,958
Come on, I can hop just fine.

1221
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:43,541
I watched my dad go to jail
when I was six.

1222
01:27:45,625 --> 01:27:47,250
I watched my mom steal…

1223
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:49,250
so I could eat.

1224
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:52,541
First time I cut myself I was 12.

1225
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:54,500
It was after…

1226
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:57,750
Well, you know when.

1227
01:27:58,875 --> 01:27:59,916
And now tonight…

1228
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:03,750
I watched your perfect boyfriend

1229
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:06,708
turn into a monster

1230
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:10,583
and kill the only person I've ever loved.

1231
01:28:13,958 --> 01:28:17,250
I've waited…
my whole fucking life for this.

1232
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:19,833
And now I've found it.

1233
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:22,583
Let me see this through.

1234
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:26,708
For Arnie…

1235
01:28:27,916 --> 01:28:28,916
for Tommy…

1236
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:31,583
for Shadyside.

1237
01:28:35,666 --> 01:28:36,708
For Shadyside.

1238
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:39,583
For Shadyside.

1239
01:28:42,333 --> 01:28:43,333
Alice!

1240
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,375
Fucking die!

1241
01:28:55,458 --> 01:28:59,166
Why won't you fucking die!

1242
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:06,833
No! Alice?

1243
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:08,708
Alice?

1244
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:10,625
Alice, just…

1245
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:13,708
Just stay with me. Alice.

1246
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:20,625
No.

1247
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:22,500
Alice!

1248
01:29:23,416 --> 01:29:24,541
Alice!

1249
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:35,541
What is that?

1250
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:07,833
Ziggy!

1251
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:08,916
Help me!

1252
01:30:20,291 --> 01:30:21,916
There it is! Go, go!

1253
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:26,833
- Here?
- Yes!

1254
01:30:26,916 --> 01:30:28,333
Dig! Dig!

1255
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:36,250
Cindy?

1256
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,791
Just keep digging!

1257
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:55,833
I hit something.

1258
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,833
The witch forever lives.

1259
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:07,208
The witch forever lives.

1260
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,125
- Cindy, what does it mean? Cindy?
- I don't know.

1261
01:31:11,208 --> 01:31:13,625
- Where is she? Where's the body?
- I don't know.

1262
01:31:17,833 --> 01:31:19,125
This way. Come on!

1263
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:36,958
What do you want, Sarah Fier?

1264
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:41,208
You want this? You can have it!

1265
01:31:41,291 --> 01:31:45,000
Just let my sister live!
Just let my sister live!

1266
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:53,750
You bled on the bone.
They're after you.

1267
01:31:53,833 --> 01:31:54,958
Get ready to run.

1268
01:31:55,041 --> 01:31:57,166
- No, Cindy, no! No, Cindy!
- Let's go!

1269
01:32:10,416 --> 01:32:11,708
No!

1270
01:32:11,791 --> 01:32:13,250
No!

1271
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:05,833
Nothing will pull us apart.

1272
01:33:05,916 --> 01:33:08,583
Never again.

1273
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,250
<i>That was July 19th, 1978.</i>

1274
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:56,791
<i>Five thousand, nine hundred
and thirty-seven days ago.</i>

1275
01:33:57,458 --> 01:33:59,041
<i>My sister was dead…</i>

1276
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:01,916
<i>and so was I.</i>

1277
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:04,125
Ziggy!

1278
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:08,583
No! Hey, hey!

1279
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:10,166
Don't die on me, OK?

1280
01:34:17,166 --> 01:34:19,333
Come on, come on, come on!

1281
01:34:24,208 --> 01:34:25,958
Come on. Come on!

1282
01:34:35,416 --> 01:34:36,500
Breathe.

1283
01:34:37,333 --> 01:34:38,375
<i>And most days…</i>

1284
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:42,041
<i>I wish I'd stayed dead.</i>

1285
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:49,541
Come on!

1286
01:34:54,666 --> 01:34:55,666
Wait…

1287
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,416
Wait, you're Ziggy?

1288
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:05,166
Hey, what's your name?
Look at me. What's your name?

1289
01:35:07,166 --> 01:35:08,166
Ziggy.

1290
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:10,750
It's Christine.

1291
01:35:11,708 --> 01:35:14,166
Her real name, it's Christine Berman.

1292
01:35:16,875 --> 01:35:19,250
Where's my… Where's my sister?

1293
01:35:27,291 --> 01:35:28,291
<i>Cindy…</i>

1294
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:31,125
<i>my sister…</i>

1295
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:35,041
<i>She sacrificed herself for nothing.</i>

1296
01:35:36,833 --> 01:35:39,458
I told everyone the story of how she died.

1297
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,625
The story I just told you.

1298
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:44,375
And no one believed me.

1299
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:48,041
And Nick?

1300
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:50,958
<i>It was her.</i>

1301
01:35:52,708 --> 01:35:55,208
Sarah Fier, the witch.

1302
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:58,000
The curse, it's…

1303
01:35:58,791 --> 01:35:59,791
it's real.

1304
01:36:01,875 --> 01:36:03,435
<i>I thought he was different.</i>

1305
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:05,916
<i>I thought he would believe me.</i>

1306
01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:09,333
<i>But Nick had a destiny in this town.</i>

1307
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:13,541
<i>And you don't become sheriff
talking about ghost stories.</i>

1308
01:36:17,458 --> 01:36:19,125
What the hell happened here?

1309
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:26,416
He just went crazy.

1310
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,125
Fucking Shadysiders.

1311
01:36:39,583 --> 01:36:41,583
<i>I couldn't see him again.</i>

1312
01:36:41,666 --> 01:36:43,041
Not after that.

1313
01:36:53,916 --> 01:36:54,916
<i>The witch…</i>

1314
01:36:58,125 --> 01:36:59,416
<i>The town curse…</i>

1315
01:37:04,041 --> 01:37:07,791
<i>For one night, Cindy believed
that there was a way to end it.</i>

1316
01:37:10,041 --> 01:37:11,750
<i>So I thought there was too.</i>

1317
01:37:14,708 --> 01:37:15,916
<i>But now I know…</i>

1318
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
there is no end.

1319
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:36,291
Like I said, your best chance
is to run from this place.

1320
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:39,333
Go as far as you can, hope a bus
doesn't hit you on the way out.

1321
01:37:39,416 --> 01:37:40,625
We found the body

1322
01:37:40,708 --> 01:37:44,625
off Highway 5 in the woods
between Shadyside and Sunnyvale.

1323
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:46,208
It's not possible.

1324
01:37:46,291 --> 01:37:48,166
Oh, it's there. Trust us.

1325
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,875
The chains, the bones, the whole thing.

1326
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:51,958
That could be anyone.

1327
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,708
Why do you think our friends died?

1328
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:59,041
For the same reason they killed Alice,
your sister.

1329
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:03,500
The killers came after us because we found
something they didn't want us to find.

1330
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:06,041
And I wish to God that it never happened,

1331
01:38:06,125 --> 01:38:08,000
but we found it.

1332
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:12,833
We found what you were looking for in '78.

1333
01:38:14,791 --> 01:38:16,375
We found Sarah Fier.

1334
01:38:17,708 --> 01:38:20,208
Look, please, we… Nurse Lane was right.

1335
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:23,541
We can end the curse
by reuniting the hand with the body.

1336
01:38:23,625 --> 01:38:26,625
And we know where the body is,
so all we need is the hand.

1337
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:30,375
What happened to Camp Nightwing?
Is the hand bone still there?

1338
01:38:30,458 --> 01:38:33,125
Is it still buried
underneath the Hanging Tree?

1339
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:05,291
<i>Union County Sheriff's Department.</i>

1340
01:39:05,375 --> 01:39:08,916
I need to talk to Nick…
Sheriff Goode.

1341
01:39:10,916 --> 01:39:12,541
<i>Sheriff, do you copy?</i>

1342
01:39:13,041 --> 01:39:14,500
Copy, what you got?

1343
01:39:14,583 --> 01:39:17,458
<i>Someone called for you.</i>
<i>Says it's an emergency.</i>

1344
01:39:17,541 --> 01:39:21,833
<i>Says that you two used to be
in a Judy Blume book club together?</i>

1345
01:39:22,666 --> 01:39:24,083
<i>Is that a real thing, boss?</i>

1346
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:28,416
<i>Hey, uh… Nicky, you there?</i>

1347
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:31,875
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

1348
01:39:47,666 --> 01:39:49,916
- Lock the doors.
- No, I'm coming with you!

1349
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,083
- No! You're not.
- Deena…

1350
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:55,666
Your nose is bleeding.

1351
01:40:01,375 --> 01:40:02,375
I'll be right back.

1352
01:40:02,875 --> 01:40:04,916
Wait. Deena! Deena!

1353
01:40:29,166 --> 01:40:30,708
I got you…

1354
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,000
you witch.

1355
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:35,750
It's over.

1356
01:40:36,333 --> 01:40:37,416
It's over.

1357
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:01,625
Sarah!

1358
01:41:02,375 --> 01:41:03,583
Sarah Fier!

1359
01:41:22,375 --> 01:41:23,375
The Devil has come.

1360
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,166
And cast his Darkness over us.

1361
01:41:32,541 --> 01:41:34,875
This Darkness grows within each of us.

1362
01:42:02,625 --> 01:42:03,958
The Devil has come.

1363
01:42:04,791 --> 01:42:07,875
You see it now… don't you?
