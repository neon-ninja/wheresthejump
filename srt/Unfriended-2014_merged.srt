1
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,532
<i>Laura?</i>

2
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:53,635
<i>Laura!</i>

3
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:01,143
<i>Laura, just don't...</i>

4
00:01:02,414 --> 00:01:06,651
- <i>Laura, do you hear me?</i>
- <i>Hey! Put it down!</i>

5
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:08,920
<i>It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. Put it down.</i>

6
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,053
- <i>Laura, stop it!</i>
- <i>Let's go inside...</i>

7
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:16,558
<i>Laura!</i>

8
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,582
<i>Oh, God!</i>

9
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,552
<i>What the fuck?</i>

10
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:43,521
- <i>You better slap that ho!</i>
- <i>Yeah, whore, I will beat your ass.</i>

11
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:48,092
<i>You'll beat my ass?
She's gonna beat my ass, everybody!</i>

12
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,862
<i>Val is gonna beat my ass.</i>

13
00:01:51,262 --> 00:01:55,333
- <i>Beat her up!</i>
- <i>Good girl Val's gonna beat my ass.</i>

14
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:57,902
<i>What the fuck? What the fuck, bro?</i>

15
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:02,474
- <i>Just get your fucking girl.</i>
- <i>Kyle, just get out of here!</i>

16
00:02:02,574 --> 00:02:05,107
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

17
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:23,594
- Hey. Hey, baby.
- <i>What's up? You okay?</i>

18
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:30,769
- <i>You sound, like, a little down.</i>
- Oh. No, no, no, no. I'm great.

19
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:32,734
<i>Okay.</i>

20
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:38,311
I got something to show you.

21
00:02:39,143 --> 00:02:42,332
<i>I'm excited. Hang on real quick.
I'm gonna pee.</i>

22
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:47,134
- Mitch.
- <i>Hey. I'm here.</i>

23
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:50,522
I got something to show you.

24
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:53,658
- <i>You doing your demon voice again?</i>
- Yeah.

25
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:56,260
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- You like them?

26
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,096
<i>Yeah. Oh, that's so hot.</i>

27
00:02:58,296 --> 00:03:02,916
It's getting me there. And feet, too.
I love just the top of toes.

28
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:05,704
What, you... wait.
You don't like them, do you?

29
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:09,274
No, it's just, you know, there's
other things I wanna see more of.

30
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:12,143
Yeah, it was worth a shot.
I think I know what you want.

31
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:15,880
Yeah, let's keep moving up.
There we go. That's closer.

32
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,582
My bruised knees.

33
00:03:17,682 --> 00:03:19,884
- No. No, I don't wanna live there.
- No? That's not it?

34
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:21,986
I don't wanna live there.
I wanna live higher.

35
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:25,356
Come on. You're a real estate agent.
Sell this to me.

36
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:31,536
Well, you are now looking at the outside
of a human's right leg.

37
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:36,000
You know what? You should just let me
come over and show you how it's done.

38
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,169
No, you can't.

39
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:40,171
What do you mean, I can't?

40
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,408
No. My dad would kill you.

41
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:47,809
That's easy. Fine.
That's worth it. I'd die for you.

42
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:52,817
You're worth it.

43
00:03:53,217 --> 00:03:56,151
I want you to take that shirt off.

44
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,340
Make me.

45
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:12,070
Take that shirt off before I cut it off.

46
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,805
That's really violent.

47
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:18,246
Take the shirt off, or I'll cut it off.

48
00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:24,348
Hey, that worked.

49
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:27,407
That does it for you? All right.

50
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,422
Keep going. Keep going, you're...

51
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,355
Faster. Come on.

52
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,795
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want those hands down there.

53
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:40,765
No, no, no. Back down.

54
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:45,291
And I want those panties off,
or you're gonna lose them.

55
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,740
You're adorable.

56
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,908
- And really sexy when you're violent.
- Yeah?

57
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,785
What?

58
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,954
What, Miss Blue Baller?

59
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:05,189
Hey, girls get them, too.

60
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:07,458
Don't... I don't wanna hear about
your balls. That's so gross.

61
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,462
- No, you know what I mean. Like...
- I don't know what you mean.

62
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:13,798
I just have this mental picture
of balls, but no.

63
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:18,602
Well, I feel like you. I don't want
to experience that anymore.

64
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:21,338
Which is...

65
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,976
- Why...
- Do you have a little speech planned?

66
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,744
I...

67
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:29,047
Stop!

68
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:31,916
- What?
- I wanna make prom night the night.

69
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:34,245
Yeah?

70
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,820
You're serious?

71
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:40,855
- You wouldn't lie to me?
- No.

72
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:44,028
You wouldn't lie to me? You're serious?

73
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:48,865
- No, I'm not lying to you.
- That's great. That is...

74
00:05:50,134 --> 00:05:52,904
That's finally the reaction
I was looking for.

75
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:55,506
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?

76
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:59,277
Your boobies!
Your, your, your, your boobies!

77
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:04,916
Yeah. Let's keep this show going.
I wanna see what I'm getting.

78
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:07,382
Prom night. I got something
to look forward to.

79
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:08,853
Hey, we'll call him back.

80
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,888
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

81
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:13,722
- It's just getting good.
- Get the knife.

82
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:17,128
Get the knife, baby.

83
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:19,163
Let's see the whole show.

84
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:21,332
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Oh, shit!

85
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:23,334
What's going on?

86
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:25,870
- Someone's in their chonies!
- What did we walk in on?

87
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,073
- A little cybersex!
- Someone's in their chonies!

88
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:32,209
Blaire, you're a dirty girl.
You're going to hell now.

89
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,045
- What?
- What are you guys doing?

90
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,848
- Going to hell with the rest of us.
- Nothing. What's up?

91
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:38,449
- Hey, guys.
- Where are you coming from, man?

92
00:06:38,549 --> 00:06:42,052
Hey, Mitch. Why do you have
such a big boner, bro?

93
00:06:42,754 --> 00:06:44,889
- What are you talking about?
- I totally missed it.

94
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,724
- Shut up.
- Hey, Blaire.

95
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,560
- Hey, Ken. How are you?
- Blaire, your blouse, babe.

96
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,062
What?

97
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:53,097
What are you calling
my girlfriend "babe" for?

98
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:55,233
Hey, Mitch, who's your buddy?

99
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,168
- What?
- Who's your buddy?

100
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:02,540
- That's not with us.
- What kind of sex were you guys having?

101
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,742
- I thought you guys brought that in.
- Ken, we were not having sex.

102
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,577
- No, wasn't us.
- Were you having a three-way?

103
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,946
No. What? Who is that?

104
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:11,983
- I just tried to hang up on him.
- Cyber three-way!

105
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,384
- Ken?
- Yeah?

106
00:07:13,484 --> 00:07:15,386
I tried to hang up on this thing.
It wouldn't let me.

107
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:19,257
- You take turns?
- Honestly, he is not in with us.

108
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:21,292
That came with you guys.

109
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:24,359
- It's not working.
- All right.

110
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:27,265
All right.

111
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:30,469
- What do you mean?
- Let's just call each other back. Yeah?

112
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:34,959
- Bye.
- Bye.

113
00:09:28,953 --> 00:09:31,422
Hi!

114
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:33,257
- Hi!
- Why is this fucker still here?

115
00:09:33,357 --> 00:09:35,759
What, Mitch's boner?

116
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:42,433
- What is this person's problem?
- Guys, guys, it's definitely a hacker.

117
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:45,069
He's spying to get info on farts
and boners, okay?

118
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,737
Is that what today's agenda is?

119
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:52,540
Well, we haven't hit the farts yet,
but thanks to the Ken's famous salsa,

120
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,879
the gas will be rolling tonight, baby.

121
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:57,782
- Guys, hey. All right, stop.
- You're so gross.

122
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:00,349
Can we get rid of this person?

123
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,224
How about I call Blaire back,
and then we'll go from there.

124
00:10:07,324 --> 00:10:09,290
- Bye.
- Bye.

125
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,599
What's up?

126
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:41,709
It's still there.

127
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:45,883
- So, were you guys really cybering?
- No.

128
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:48,486
Is that, like, a thing you do?

129
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:50,488
It's...

130
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:52,356
- It's really cute.
- It's still here.

131
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:54,922
You guys are so cute.

132
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,995
- Hey, guys.
- Heyo!

133
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,971
It's still here.

134
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:07,571
Whatever, fuck it.

135
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:10,474
- It's just probably a glitch.
- How do we know that?

136
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:12,710
Yeah, I can't call the number
or anything like that...

137
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,581
Shit! Three stars, motherfuckers!
Suck on that!

138
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:20,217
Yo, so I talked to Kyle about Friday.

139
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:23,653
And I got the weed,
but he's out of molly. So...

140
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,283
What?

141
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:20,741
Blaire, come back!
Blaire! Where'd you go?

142
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:24,922
- Stop looking at porn!
- Shut up, for, like, a second.

143
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:30,591
- Are you talking to boys?
- Hey, I'm writing an email. Stop.

144
00:18:30,828 --> 00:18:33,429
...from the horse's mouth.

145
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:24,982
Guys, did you talk to Val tonight?

146
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,771
Dude, when we were at Adam's party,
she was telling people

147
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,254
- I had a drinking problem.
- You do.

148
00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:33,856
- I'm gonna add her.
- Can I just be honest? I don't like Val.

149
00:19:34,157 --> 00:19:36,493
- Nobody likes Val.
- Can I just be honest? I don't like her.

150
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:42,038
- The only person that likes Val is Val.
- Is Val. Yeah. You just get me, Jess.

151
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:44,935
Hi, Val.

152
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:47,871
- Hey, Val.
- Hey, Val.

153
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:52,340
Val. Turn up the sound, you dumb bitch.

154
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,745
Val!

155
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:57,848
- Can you hear me now, Ken?
- Yeah, there you are, you floozy.

156
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:00,384
Hi, yeah. You know,
when you talk and it's muted,

157
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:04,779
I can still hear you on your end.
So I don't appreciate "dumb bitch."

158
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:10,093
Okay. Did you guys buy your tickets,
like, two weeks ago like I asked you?

159
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:14,197
- No, you said you were gonna get 'em.
- No, you didn't. No, I told you to buy them.

160
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:17,534
So now I'm hearing that you guys
are gonna be seated in the balcony,

161
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,636
and three of us are gonna have
to sit in the orchestra.

162
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:21,939
So, maybe you should have bought
your tickets sooner like I told you.

163
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:24,074
- All right. What? I don't care.
- That's too bad.

164
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:28,211
- I wish you bought your ticket earlier.
- Which seats are better, balcony or orchestra?

165
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,913
- Balcony.
- Balcony.

166
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,181
- I'll take orchestra.
- Okay, you're in balcony.

167
00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:33,417
I can take one more in balcony.

168
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:36,753
- I'll take it in the orchestra.
- I'm sure you will.

169
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:38,689
Jess.

170
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:41,858
- Oh, my God!
- You're the only one that got that.

171
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,164
- Val.
- What?

172
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:49,132
- Wait. What?
- Looking good.

173
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:51,201
Thank you.

174
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:53,103
- No.
- I got a haircut, like, two days ago.

175
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:57,240
No. I mean, you look good right now, too,
but check your Facebook.

176
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,139
What?

177
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:03,914
These are intense. Hold on.

178
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,816
- Did you give Jess permission?
- Jess! What the shit?

179
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,151
- Dude!
- Why would you post that?

180
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:09,853
This is the first time I'm seeing these.

181
00:21:09,953 --> 00:21:12,089
- These are incredible.
- Oh, my God. It just came from your account.

182
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,457
- I've never seen these before.
- Jess!

183
00:21:13,557 --> 00:21:16,059
These are amazing.
Val, I didn't know you were so much fun.

184
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,831
Oh, my God! A bong? Okay, seriously,
I'm friends with my mom on here.

185
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:22,132
- All right.
- Come on!

186
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:24,868
- Should I look at these? Is this worth a look?
- What the hell! Delete these!

187
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:27,371
- Jess, take these off. They're not good.
- Dude, I didn't...

188
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:30,541
- Delete them, Jess.
- I didn't do this, okay?

189
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:34,411
- I don't know why you're getting so pissed.
- You trashy little bitch. Delete them.

190
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:37,347
Wait. Wait, did you just call me trashy?

191
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:38,882
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, Jess.

192
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:41,818
So, you're asking me for a fucking favor,
to take down these photos

193
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:45,722
- that I didn't post in the first place...
- I'm asking for a favor? I'm asking for...

194
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:47,257
- You posted them.
- Yeah, I didn't fucking do it, okay?

195
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:52,729
So you can be nice to me and I can
help you or you can suck my fucking dick...

196
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:55,533
- ...fucking party.
- ...and piss off.

197
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:58,301
Close your trashy little mouth for,
like, one second and listen to me.

198
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:01,338
I will beat your ass any goddamn day
if you come over here.

199
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:04,741
- I'm so sure. I'm so sure.
- Listen, we are not ghetto.

200
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:06,866
- No. Okay, how about this? Mitch...
- Blaire, really?

201
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:10,580
- Do you want me to fucking delete them or not?
- Yes! Delete them now.

202
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,584
I'll come pick you girls up and we can go
fight outside of a Wendy's or something...

203
00:22:13,684 --> 00:22:15,786
- Ken, not helping.
- Ken. Stop, you're not helping.

204
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:19,323
We can go to a Taco Bell parking lot
and you guys can slap-fight it out.

205
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:21,725
- I'll pick both of you up.
- Thank you, Jess.

206
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:23,793
You wish.

207
00:22:24,227 --> 00:22:26,964
I am so wet right now.

208
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:29,333
- They're still here, Jess.
- It's, like, not working.

209
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,502
Why are you so quick to assume that
I posted these when I'm telling you...

210
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:35,673
- Who else would have?
- I've never fucking seen these photos before.

211
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:38,809
Oh, my God! Shut up.

212
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:43,013
I try to hit delete, and it disappears.
I reload the page, it's still there.

213
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:47,084
I hit delete. I'm trying. I'm fucking
trying to help you. Okay, Val?

214
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:50,817
You have a headache, Ken?
You have a headache?

215
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:55,292
- Okay, it looks like it's working.
- Thank you.

216
00:22:56,092 --> 00:22:57,361
Okay.

217
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,996
Unbelievable that you would think
that would be fine.

218
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,162
Okay, they're gone.

219
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:05,736
- No, they're not.
- No. Adam po...

220
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:08,705
- You owe me a thank you.
- Adam! What the shit!

221
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,274
- What?
- You posted some now, too?

222
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:15,412
- Did you just copy and paste them?
- No. I didn't fucking post anything.

223
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:17,414
You guys need to stop.

224
00:23:18,114 --> 00:23:20,584
- I'm a bitch, Jess?
- Chill out, Val.

225
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:23,686
Don't... you're doing
your nails right now.

226
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:27,324
- You're so innocent. I'm a bitch? Really?
- Anger issues much?

227
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:30,160
Dude, I'm not even fucking typing.
I don't know what to say.

228
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,598
- What is happening right now?
- What the fuck? I've dated, like, two guys.

229
00:23:34,698 --> 00:23:36,700
- I didn't type that.
- Fuck you, okay?

230
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,069
- I didn't type that.
- Bullshit.

231
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,904
Hey... somebody let me know
when it's fucking over.

232
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:43,473
I love that you think I'm a fucking slut,
and your ass is drunk...

233
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:46,640
- I didn't type that!
- Girls, stop.

234
00:23:47,143 --> 00:23:48,378
- Please.
- Okay, yeah, Blaire.

235
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:53,283
- Just take Jess' side. Of course.
- I love you girls so much. Let's be...

236
00:23:53,383 --> 00:23:56,019
- Blaire, you're just gonna take Jess' side?
- No, I'm not on Jess' side.

237
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:59,556
- You just typed that.
- I don't think she should've put these... What?

238
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:03,591
- No, I didn't type anything!
- If you didn't type it, then who did?

239
00:24:09,132 --> 00:24:11,234
Well, who the fuck is Billie?

240
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:14,404
- I told you I didn't post those photos, Val.
- Guys, who is this?

241
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:15,639
- I don't know.
- He was here the whole time?

242
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:18,408
Ken, you said it was just a glitch.

243
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:21,476
Well, the glitch just typed!

244
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:30,721
Brucer.

245
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:32,723
Dude, I bet this guy's
been here the whole time.

246
00:24:32,823 --> 00:24:36,059
I do not know a Billie,
but he apparently hates Val.

247
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,992
This is Laura's account.

248
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,597
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

249
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,603
Not Laura Barns?

250
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:50,763
Yes, I'm still friends with her on here.
I never, like, deleted it.

251
00:24:55,512 --> 00:24:57,474
Seriously?

252
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:02,143
Who is doing this?

253
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:07,355
Maybe it's Laura.

254
00:25:08,858 --> 00:25:10,093
Ken.

255
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:12,559
Who hacks a dead girl?

256
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:16,799
- Maybe it's her brother or something.
- Why would he do that, Jess?

257
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:18,799
He was a weirdo.

258
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:21,266
Not that weird!

259
00:25:42,993 --> 00:25:45,929
It's probably just,
like, a troll or something.

260
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,697
What is a troll?

261
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:51,401
An Internet troll? Like, someone
that just harasses people online.

262
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:54,334
They just wanna get reactions
out of people.

263
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,909
Can we hang up on him?

264
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:02,679
- No, I can't. I can't hang up on him.
- If we can't... Fine, I'll take care of him.

265
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:05,282
Hi, Billie, listen, sweetheart.

266
00:26:05,382 --> 00:26:08,084
You're a fucking asshole, and if you
don't take these down right now,

267
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:11,652
I'll come over there and knock
the trash out of your ears!

268
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:18,271
Who the fuck is this guy?

269
00:26:26,803 --> 00:26:28,204
Okay.

270
00:26:28,304 --> 00:26:31,408
All right, let's stop fucking around.
Everyone, hands up, right now.

271
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,276
Who's doing this?

272
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:35,977
- Not me.
- Adam, here we go.

273
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:50,157
I told you it wasn't me,
that's all I can say.

274
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:55,131
- All right, let's hang up on him.
- There's, like, no... there's no button.

275
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:57,167
- There is no button.
- What do you mean?

276
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:59,533
There's no button to hang up on him.

277
00:27:06,576 --> 00:27:09,316
Guys, he's, like, sending me something.

278
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:16,553
Oh, my God! Where did you get this?

279
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:19,489
This is fucked up, do you hear me?

280
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:21,024
- Val, what is it?
- Brucer, shut up!

281
00:27:21,124 --> 00:27:24,327
- Calm down, Val.
- No, I can't calm down, this is messed up!

282
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:28,298
Val, I told you not to snapchat
your boobs.

283
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,634
Oh, really?

284
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:33,837
Really? That's a threat.
Yeah, you know what?

285
00:27:33,937 --> 00:27:37,204
Yes, asshole, good news,
I'm calling the cops.

286
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,507
Congratulations, dipshit.

287
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:44,581
- I'm calling.
- Val, you don't need to call the cops.

288
00:27:44,681 --> 00:27:46,549
- Just calm down.
- Yes, I do. I do need to call the cops.

289
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:50,083
Okay? It's a threat. Hi. Hi.

290
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:53,289
Listen, my name
is Valerie Rommel, I'm online

291
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:56,725
and there's some asshole
making direct threats against me.

292
00:27:57,327 --> 00:28:00,230
- Brucer! Yeah. Hold...
- Yep.

293
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,366
Ken, I swear to God, if I find out
this is you, I will burn you alive.

294
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:05,899
- You understand me?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

295
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:10,373
Thanks for stopping by, Val.
Real nice lady, real nice chick.

296
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:12,840
She said she was gonna
burn me alive, dude.

297
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:16,246
- This isn't you, Jess?
- Jess, it's not you?

298
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:20,216
- No way. Not worth my time.
- She can't do a powerpoint presentation...

299
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:24,120
It's more... more than likely,
it's some girl that she's pissed off,

300
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,823
and she's getting fucking scared,
and she fucking deserves it.

301
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:27,872
I'm sorry. She takes a shit...

302
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:31,127
Should we take screen grabs
of the stuff that he was saying?

303
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:34,164
It's "Billie" with an I-E.
It's definitely a girl.

304
00:28:34,264 --> 00:28:37,434
- It's kind of threatening, right?
- He's been listening this whole time.

305
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:40,504
- It's not letting me take a screen grab.
- Yeah, me neither.

306
00:28:41,204 --> 00:28:43,173
- Let's just get out of here.
- Let's just hang up.

307
00:28:43,273 --> 00:28:46,142
All right. I'll see you guys
tomorrow. Hey!

308
00:28:46,242 --> 00:28:48,622
- Come over, Adam, and we'll go see...
- Kyle?

309
00:28:48,722 --> 00:28:51,514
- We'll go across the tracks.
- All right, I'm down.

310
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:54,581
- Wait.
- What?

311
00:28:55,118 --> 00:28:58,852
- I just got an email from him.
- What is it?

312
00:28:59,222 --> 00:29:00,957
- This is Laura's email.
- What'd they say?

313
00:29:01,057 --> 00:29:04,094
- It's a link.
- It's just a stupid troll, dude.

314
00:29:04,194 --> 00:29:07,063
Obvious troll is obvious.

315
00:29:08,298 --> 00:29:10,901
Just send it to Ken
so he can find out who it is.

316
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:12,335
Just forward it to me.

317
00:29:12,435 --> 00:29:15,969
Let Ken, like, try to find
the IP address or something.

318
00:29:16,806 --> 00:29:20,376
Okay, either I'm going crazy,
or there's no forwarding button.

319
00:29:20,476 --> 00:29:22,278
It's at the bottom,
if you click on, like, "reply all."

320
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:24,226
- No, I know where it is, baby, but...
- You in Gmail?

321
00:29:24,326 --> 00:29:25,849
Yeah.

322
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:28,351
Oh, my God, Blaire, do you know
how to use a fucking computer?

323
00:29:28,451 --> 00:29:32,220
- Fucking open it!
- Share me your screen.

324
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:38,161
Jesus. Just forward the shit on to Ken
so we don't have to deal with this again.

325
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:40,463
- My God.
- Adam.

326
00:29:40,563 --> 00:29:42,332
See, look.

327
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:46,161
It literally doesn't exist. There's no
"forward" button. Do you see it?

328
00:29:47,273 --> 00:29:49,082
No.

329
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:53,695
Dude, weird computer shit
happens to me all the time.

330
00:30:02,518 --> 00:30:05,185
Click the fucking link, dude!

331
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:16,332
- Yikes.
- Oh, Val.

332
00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:19,454
Val, you're fucking sick!

333
00:30:20,837 --> 00:30:23,907
In Val's defense, her comment wasn't
completely unwarranted, okay?

334
00:30:24,007 --> 00:30:27,243
Nobody wants to talk about it,
but I'll give you the Ken-pinion.

335
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:28,978
Laura fucking sucked.

336
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:34,214
She was a big bully, okay, and she deserved
all the shit she got from that video.

337
00:30:34,717 --> 00:30:38,685
Ken, dude. Come on.

338
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,192
- Ken.
- What?

339
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:45,625
Sorry. I'm sorry,
that was in poor taste.

340
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:41,263
"They should lock you up."
"You monster"?

341
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,848
What the...

342
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:01,035
Okay, you're a fucking creeper.
What do you want?

343
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:09,599
Val, what'd the cops say?

344
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:12,933
- What is it?
- I think it's frozen.

345
00:34:17,106 --> 00:34:20,447
Hey, Val, you stupid bitch,
say something.

346
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,371
Did you guys hear her call?

347
00:34:34,457 --> 00:34:36,489
I'm calling her.

348
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:42,497
Guys, look at her mirror.

349
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,502
- Do you guys see the mirror?
- The mirror's fucked up. Yeah.

350
00:34:45,602 --> 00:34:47,970
What's going on over there?

351
00:34:48,971 --> 00:34:51,861
- Val!
- Val?

352
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:55,778
Dude, maybe she's doing this shit.
Like, for attention.

353
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:57,113
- Blaire, is it going through?
- You think of that?

354
00:34:57,213 --> 00:35:01,251
Yeah, I... Look, look at it!
It's right there.

355
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:05,221
- She's not...
- Holy shit.

356
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:07,420
Wait...

357
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

358
00:35:19,735 --> 00:35:21,304
- What was that?
- Holy shit.

359
00:35:21,404 --> 00:35:23,472
- Shit.
- Val?

360
00:35:24,573 --> 00:35:26,339
What?

361
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:30,480
- Val!
- What the hell?

362
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,147
What just happened?
Did she close the computer? Did it drop?

363
00:35:43,025 --> 00:35:44,394
- Anyone home?
- Hello?

364
00:35:44,494 --> 00:35:46,596
- Hello?
- Hello?

365
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:48,965
- Hello?
- Hey.

366
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:53,570
Fresno County sheriff's office.
Somebody called 911?

367
00:36:00,543 --> 00:36:02,111
- Hello?
- Can they hear us?

368
00:36:02,211 --> 00:36:04,714
Hello, hey! Down at the computer!

369
00:36:04,814 --> 00:36:06,382
- Hello?
- Hello?

370
00:36:06,482 --> 00:36:07,850
- Hey!
- Dispatch, we got a...

371
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,020
- Hello? Hello, can you hear us?
- Wait, what'd they say?

372
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,323
10-35?

373
00:36:13,723 --> 00:36:15,658
- I heard 10-25.
- Which one?

374
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:18,127
- 10-30.
- 10-25.

375
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:20,961
- What is that?
- 10-35...

376
00:36:22,798 --> 00:36:25,758
- No, it's a time check, so...
- That's insane.

377
00:36:26,902 --> 00:36:29,038
5250?

378
00:36:29,138 --> 00:36:32,180
5250? I didn't hear 5250.

379
00:36:32,908 --> 00:36:35,678
No, it's a mental...

380
00:36:36,178 --> 00:36:39,182
- No shit.
- Val used to have seizures!

381
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:41,217
- Yeah, we'll start around the...
- Guys, she...

382
00:36:41,317 --> 00:36:44,487
- Are you sure? I don't remember.
- Yeah, she told me, like, a long time ago.

383
00:36:44,587 --> 00:36:46,989
She had this sickness
that causes seizures.

384
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:51,060
- Maybe she just had a frickin' seizure.
- Have you ever seen her have a seizure?

385
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,897
- Jesus. This is a 10-55.
- No, dude, they said 10-55.

386
00:36:54,997 --> 00:36:58,652
- 10-55?
- 10-55?

387
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
10-55...
10-55 is suicide.
Did they really just say 10-55?

388
00:37:06,676 --> 00:37:08,678
- Val?
- Oh, my God.

389
00:37:08,778 --> 00:37:11,248
- Hello? Hello?
- Shit.

390
00:37:12,048 --> 00:37:13,082
Okay. All right, I'm calling.

391
00:37:13,182 --> 00:37:16,216
- Does anyone know her parents' number?
- I'll try to get her back, okay?

392
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,654
Nobody accept.

393
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:39,126
No one accept it.

394
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:16,042
What...

395
00:38:20,816 --> 00:38:22,824
Who are you?

396
00:38:31,694 --> 00:38:33,796
What did he send you guys?

397
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:35,595
What?

398
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:45,817
I can't fucking shut it off.

399
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:51,981
- We gotta get him out.
- Who cares? We have to go over and help Val.

400
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:54,550
- We can do this shit after.
- Wait, hold on. The cops are with Val.

401
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,387
- We're doing this shit after.
- What's the point?

402
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:01,854
What are you guys gonna do
that the cops can't do?

403
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:05,565
Fuck this! We're not doing this here.
Everyone, just fucking stop.

404
00:39:05,665 --> 00:39:08,497
- Pick up your phone, mute your computers.
- I don't know where my phone is, guys.

405
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:11,433
- Seriously, please don't do this.
- Hold on, Jess...

406
00:39:18,474 --> 00:39:20,507
Fuck, guys.

407
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,119
Guys?

408
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:32,422
- Whatever he's doing, it can wait, okay?
- ...Val's in five minutes.

409
00:39:32,522 --> 00:39:36,125
Guys, I can hear you. He can hear you.
He can turn your mics on.

410
00:39:36,225 --> 00:39:38,360
Guys, can you just
fucking trust me, okay?

411
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,363
Install this program
and I'll find out who it is.

412
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:45,134
Who cares, dude? Val's in fucking
trouble. You just saw her.

413
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:47,403
Ken can get him out, okay?
We need to stop this guy.

414
00:39:47,503 --> 00:39:50,840
- Billie, just let us leave, okay?
- You guys wanna know who this is or not?

415
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,476
Yeah, we're ready to play, Billie.

416
00:39:53,576 --> 00:39:56,064
- Jess, we're gonna play a game.
- I don't know what's happening!

417
00:39:56,164 --> 00:39:59,015
We're gonna play a game, okay?
You wanna play the game.

418
00:39:59,115 --> 00:40:01,317
You wanna play the game.
Jess, you wanna play the game.

419
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:03,253
Okay.

420
00:40:03,753 --> 00:40:05,187
- Okay, is it fixed?
- What is it?

421
00:40:05,287 --> 00:40:08,621
It's just a game. We're just all
gonna download it and play it, right?

422
00:40:10,693 --> 00:40:13,760
I'm not doing anything, man.
I just wanted to play a game.

423
00:40:14,764 --> 00:40:17,467
You like games. You seem to like games.
Dude, I thought we were gonna play.

424
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:20,002
All right. I have a fucking
great game for you, man.

425
00:40:20,102 --> 00:40:22,735
- Okay, you guys got it?
- Yeah.

426
00:40:23,305 --> 00:40:25,539
Okay. I just launched it.

427
00:40:29,245 --> 00:40:31,781
I got something for you, Billie.

428
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:33,382
Fucking shit.

429
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:35,618
Okay, okay, okay. Is it searching, guys?

430
00:40:35,718 --> 00:40:38,788
- Did everybody download it?
- Mine's got something. Mine's got something.

431
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:42,189
Okay, good. Wait till everybody
got something.

432
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:46,531
Is it flagging? Has everybody got some flags?
It should be more than one, too.

433
00:40:46,631 --> 00:40:48,045
- It should be multiple.
- Yeah.

434
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,011
- Okay, cool.
- Yes.

435
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:53,803
Hit "trash." Trash all of those and then
empty your recycling bins, okay?

436
00:40:53,903 --> 00:40:56,939
Yeah, empty your recycling bin
after you trash it. Do not save them.

437
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:59,677
Everything. Everything that's flagged.

438
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:05,982
- It's not gonna delete these.
- Just fucking listen to me. Trust me, dude.

439
00:41:06,082 --> 00:41:08,250
- Shit. Shit.
- Okay.

440
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,453
Is it deleted? What's going on?
Keep me updated, guys.

441
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:14,757
- Okay. Okay, Adam's is done. Mitch?
- Mine's the same.

442
00:41:14,857 --> 00:41:16,325
- Okay, Jess?
- Mine's done.

443
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:18,457
Okay, Blaire?

444
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:21,463
- Blaire? Blaire!
- Shit.

445
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:25,201
There's a lot in my recycling bin.
I don't know how to make it go faster.

446
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:27,503
- What?
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.

447
00:41:27,603 --> 00:41:29,038
Adam, don't make him mad.

448
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:31,540
- Adam, you are overreacting.
- He's got...

449
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,008
- It's gonna be fine. We just need...
- Just stop.

450
00:41:33,108 --> 00:41:37,021
We're just waiting on Blaire's bin, guys.
Everything is gonna be cool, I promise.

451
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:39,682
- Blaire...
- There's a pinwheel, I don't...

452
00:41:39,782 --> 00:41:43,185
- Why is he counting down?
- Don't worry about it. Just get it done.

453
00:41:43,285 --> 00:41:46,388
- Okay. It's cool, Blaire.
- It's done! Everything's... it's done.

454
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:48,591
- It's done? It's gone?
- Yes.

455
00:41:48,691 --> 00:41:49,792
Thank God.

456
00:41:49,892 --> 00:41:51,794
- Is it gone?
- Is he out?

457
00:41:51,894 --> 00:41:54,363
Yeah. Yeah.

458
00:41:54,463 --> 00:41:56,899
Fuck you, Billie. Suck on that, bitch!

459
00:41:56,999 --> 00:41:59,268
Thank you, Ken.

460
00:41:59,368 --> 00:42:01,804
Adam, you pulled out a fucking gun!

461
00:42:01,904 --> 00:42:04,140
Dude, what the hell was that?

462
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,242
- Did you load that thing?
- Yeah, man.

463
00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:09,511
You were flinging it around!
It's going to go off.

464
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,712
I can't believe it. What were you
gonna do, shoot through the computer?

465
00:42:12,812 --> 00:42:18,053
- Guys! Guys, I saved your life.
- We just... Val used to get seizures.

466
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:20,322
- We should call the cops.
- That's the only thing I can think of.

467
00:42:20,422 --> 00:42:21,890
Okay.

468
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:24,724
I had a conversation on my computer...

469
00:43:16,378 --> 00:43:18,247
<i>911, please state your emergency.</i>

470
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:23,385
Yeah, hi, there's someone
threatening me and my friends online,

471
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:26,388
and they also threatened
our friend, Valerie Rommel.

472
00:43:26,488 --> 00:43:28,958
You sent some officers over there
earlier to her house,

473
00:43:29,058 --> 00:43:33,362
but they didn't see what we saw,
and there's a lot more to the story. So...

474
00:43:33,462 --> 00:43:35,931
<i>What is your friend's address?</i>

475
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,967
- What?
- <i>Her address.</i>

476
00:43:38,067 --> 00:43:40,735
Guys? Guys, what's her address?

477
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:44,571
- Hold on, I have it in my desk. Hold on.
- One sec.

478
00:43:46,442 --> 00:43:49,812
10705 East Bauer.

479
00:43:49,912 --> 00:43:52,314
Yeah, it's 10705 East Bauer.

480
00:43:52,414 --> 00:43:55,151
And he keeps threatening us,
and he won't leave us alone, and...

481
00:43:55,251 --> 00:43:57,686
<i>Where are you right now, sir?</i>

482
00:43:57,786 --> 00:44:01,256
I'm at home. Online, with my friends.

483
00:44:01,356 --> 00:44:04,226
- <i>Are you safe?</i>
- Yeah.

484
00:44:04,326 --> 00:44:06,392
<i>All of you?</i>

485
00:44:07,696 --> 00:44:09,064
Yeah, we're good.

486
00:44:09,164 --> 00:44:11,998
- <i>Even Ken?</i>
- What?

487
00:44:13,468 --> 00:44:16,072
- <i>Don't hang up.</i>
- What?

488
00:44:16,172 --> 00:44:18,204
But what just happened?

489
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,326
<i>I said, "don't hang up."</i>

490
00:44:27,716 --> 00:44:29,818
Who did you call?

491
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:33,552
Fuck! It's this fucking asshole!

492
00:44:48,737 --> 00:44:51,528
Hey, genius, we can see you!

493
00:44:54,743 --> 00:44:57,276
Hey! Hey, buddy!

494
00:45:02,751 --> 00:45:03,986
You know what?

495
00:45:04,086 --> 00:45:07,289
What is that?
It's behind, like, a lattice?

496
00:45:07,389 --> 00:45:11,749
- Like, a crate or something? Like...
- It's not letting me hang up.

497
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,309
Wait, Ken! Ken!

498
00:45:21,837 --> 00:45:24,540
- What?
- Wait, come back.

499
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,539
What?

500
00:45:28,844 --> 00:45:30,679
Back up a little bit.

501
00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:33,546
- Why?
- Just do it, dude.

502
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:36,509
Ken, what the fuck's going on?

503
00:47:14,516 --> 00:47:16,182
Ken.

504
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
- What the fuck?
- Ken? Ken?

505
00:47:25,794 --> 00:47:28,127
- Don't kill me!
- Ken!

506
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:32,067
Is he okay? Ken!

507
00:47:33,302 --> 00:47:37,506
- Oh, my God! Ken! Ken...
- Ken, come on! Ken, stop fucking around!

508
00:47:37,606 --> 00:47:40,275
Oh, my God! No! Don't...

509
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:42,010
- Guys...
- Holy shit!

510
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:46,212
- What was he doing?
- What the fuck just happened? Ken?

511
00:47:46,848 --> 00:47:48,117
Shut up, Jess! Just shut up!

512
00:47:48,217 --> 00:47:50,520
- What the fuck?
- Shut up, Jess! Fuck!

513
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,654
- This is so fucked up!
- This isn't funny anymore!

514
00:47:52,754 --> 00:47:57,025
Fuck this shit! Okay?
I'm fucking out of here! You hear me?

515
00:47:59,094 --> 00:48:00,960
Fuck.

516
00:48:15,043 --> 00:48:16,806
Fuck.

517
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:19,815
Hey, babe, go lock your door.
Go lock your door.

518
00:48:19,915 --> 00:48:23,104
What? I think it is locked.

519
00:48:28,123 --> 00:48:29,956
Hello?

520
00:48:31,726 --> 00:48:33,428
Hello?

521
00:48:33,528 --> 00:48:35,494
Oh, fuck.

522
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,638
What do you see? Adam?

523
00:48:43,738 --> 00:48:45,474
Adam, what do you see?

524
00:48:45,574 --> 00:48:47,352
Guys...

525
00:48:54,816 --> 00:48:57,719
There's fucking no one here.

526
00:48:57,819 --> 00:49:00,222
I'm gonna go check it out.

527
00:49:00,322 --> 00:49:02,391
- No, no, no. Don't. Don't.
- No, don't do it.

528
00:49:02,491 --> 00:49:05,258
- No, Adam, no!
- What?

529
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:09,262
What the...

530
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:13,335
- Is it locked?
- Lock the door.

531
00:49:13,435 --> 00:49:15,834
- Lock your door.
- Yeah, I fucking...

532
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:20,011
Who's there? Hey!

533
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:25,171
Who's here?

534
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:29,561
I have a fucking gun! You hear me?

535
00:49:31,486 --> 00:49:34,987
Fuck. What the fuck?

536
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,834
What do you want?

537
00:49:55,777 --> 00:49:57,973
What video?

538
00:49:58,947 --> 00:50:01,383
- <i>What the fuck?</i>
- <i>You better slap that ho!</i>

539
00:50:01,483 --> 00:50:05,387
- <i>Yeah, whore, I will beat your ass.</i>
- <i>You'll beat my ass?</i>

540
00:50:05,487 --> 00:50:07,723
<i>She's gonna beat my ass, everybody!</i>

541
00:50:08,623 --> 00:50:12,093
<i>Val is gonna beat my ass!
Val is gonna beat my ass!</i>

542
00:51:13,655 --> 00:51:15,457
- No, this isn't on us, man.
- This isn't our fault.

543
00:51:15,557 --> 00:51:17,623
This is not on us.

544
00:52:45,814 --> 00:52:48,413
- What?
- What?

545
00:52:50,285 --> 00:52:53,021
No. No, fuck this. I'm not...

546
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:56,181
I'm not fucking playing any fucking...

547
00:52:57,592 --> 00:53:00,322
- Adam! Adam, stop!
- What? What?

548
00:53:12,173 --> 00:53:14,408
Like the drinking game?

549
00:53:20,248 --> 00:53:22,951
What? Wait, how do you play?
How do you play?

550
00:53:23,051 --> 00:53:25,650
I'm not playing your fucking games.

551
00:53:26,888 --> 00:53:30,058
Why don't you fucking explain it.
It's your fucking game, man!

552
00:53:30,158 --> 00:53:32,561
Somebody just tell me how to play!
Guys... Jess, how do you...

553
00:53:32,661 --> 00:53:36,131
Dude... okay, you put up five fingers,
and then if you've done something,

554
00:53:36,231 --> 00:53:38,844
you have to put your finger down.

555
00:53:42,904 --> 00:53:44,937
That's how it works.

556
00:53:51,045 --> 00:53:54,124
This is the dumbest fucking thing.

557
00:53:54,583 --> 00:53:57,285
What... Why are you... why?

558
00:53:57,385 --> 00:53:59,718
I'm gonna lose.

559
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:03,655
- Are we doing this?
- I don't wanna play.

560
00:54:07,396 --> 00:54:10,198
Put your hands up. Put your hands up.
Put your hands up!

561
00:54:10,298 --> 00:54:13,766
Just fucking do it.
Fine, all right, five fingers up, fine.

562
00:54:20,742 --> 00:54:24,010
- Who did that?
- Wasn't fucking me.

563
00:54:25,246 --> 00:54:28,013
Okay, fuck, it was me, okay?

564
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,920
- You said it was Val.
- Okay, I lied, all right?

565
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,488
You...

566
00:54:33,588 --> 00:54:35,924
It's not like there's not
some kind of truth in there!

567
00:54:36,024 --> 00:54:38,310
- What are you doing?
- Dude, it's not my fault!

568
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:40,929
You're the one who's like,
"I'm not hungry, I already ate."

569
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:43,295
- All that shit.
- Do not do this right now.

570
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:52,540
- It wasn't fucking me.
- It was one of you guys?

571
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,516
Jess, stop it!
Don't attack people right now.

572
00:54:54,616 --> 00:54:56,278
I'm sorry, it was me, okay?

573
00:54:56,378 --> 00:54:58,780
We were drunk, and it happened,
and I didn't know how to tell you.

574
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,184
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- I'm sorry, Jess.

575
00:55:03,284 --> 00:55:05,787
- Great friend, Blaire.
- I have apologized.

576
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:09,424
She's not apologized for starting
this rumor thing about me.

577
00:55:09,524 --> 00:55:12,988
- That is not true, by the way.
- Hey! We're keeping together on this.

578
00:55:13,088 --> 00:55:14,364
Stop it.

579
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,233
That was me. Easy.

580
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:25,106
It was last year. She kissed me.
I threw her off. Nothing happened.

581
00:55:25,206 --> 00:55:27,272
It's fine.

582
00:55:30,479 --> 00:55:34,549
What? No, no, please tell me
he's lying, Jess, you fucking bitch!

583
00:55:34,649 --> 00:55:37,454
- Fuck you. It wasn't me, okay?
- Shut up. Shut up! It was me, man.

584
00:55:37,554 --> 00:55:39,252
- It was me. I'm sorry.
- It was you?

585
00:55:39,352 --> 00:55:41,059
- Yeah.
- What? Why?

586
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:42,858
What do you mean, "What? Why?"
Does it really fucking matter?

587
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:46,160
Yeah, it does to me, Mitch!
They put me in fucking handcuffs, man!

588
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,398
I almost had a record! My fucking dad
almost disowned me for that!

589
00:55:50,498 --> 00:55:54,135
It was gonna be both of us or one of us,
and I would do the same shit for you.

590
00:55:54,235 --> 00:55:55,470
- So let me take the rap?
- Hey, it doesn't matter!

591
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:59,183
- It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!
- Oh, my fucking hero, Mitch.

592
00:55:59,283 --> 00:56:01,174
- Knock it off!
- My hero!

593
00:56:04,245 --> 00:56:08,349
- Fuck. You guys are fucked up, man!
- Like you don't have enough fucking money.

594
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:11,052
- Keep it, bitch!
- Fucking asshole.

595
00:56:11,152 --> 00:56:16,505
Yeah, let's listen to Blaire again, 'cause
that keeps working out so fucking well.

596
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,272
What?

597
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:36,790
Guys, are you serious?

598
00:56:37,712 --> 00:56:40,568
None of us did that.
We wouldn't do that.

599
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:43,818
- Blaire?
- What?

600
00:56:43,918 --> 00:56:47,188
- Blaire, did you do that?
- No!

601
00:56:47,288 --> 00:56:51,860
- How do we know?
- Hey! It's not her. It's not her.

602
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,728
- I... we wouldn't do that.
- Put down a finger and we'll see.

603
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:56,779
- She already said it. Stop pushing her!
- Yeah, I heard her say that!

604
00:56:56,879 --> 00:56:59,467
- She always tells the truth, Mitch?
- Yeah! Yeah.

605
00:56:59,567 --> 00:57:02,837
Oh, she does?
She always tells the truth, right?

606
00:57:02,937 --> 00:57:06,107
'Cause you always
tell the truth, right, Blaire?

607
00:57:06,207 --> 00:57:09,074
You always tell the truth.

608
00:57:16,818 --> 00:57:18,920
Fine, it was me.

609
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,722
- Adam, Jesus!
- You piece of shit!

610
00:57:20,822 --> 00:57:22,941
You're a fucking piece of shit.
You know that?

611
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:25,160
Fuck you! You're a piece of shit!

612
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,894
- I'm just nothing to you, Adam.
- You piece of shit.

613
00:57:26,994 --> 00:57:30,832
Fuck you! He said if I traded you
that the three of us could live.

614
00:57:30,932 --> 00:57:33,801
- I was trying to save your life, Mitch.
- No! No!

615
00:57:41,609 --> 00:57:44,880
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you, Adam!

616
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:48,817
'Cause you guys are all so
fucking perfect, right? Yeah?

617
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:52,406
- Wait. Guys, guys, guys. Come on, please.
- Okay. All right. I see.

618
00:57:52,506 --> 00:57:54,189
- You know what? Fuck this.
- Guys, come on.

619
00:57:54,289 --> 00:57:59,147
I got an idea. Hey, Billie,
why don't you lay off? I got this one.

620
00:57:59,947 --> 00:58:02,697
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Easy one.

621
00:58:02,797 --> 00:58:06,565
Never have I ever had sex.

622
00:58:07,569 --> 00:58:11,205
- Hey, Billie, can we get a timer, please?
- What are you doing right now?

623
00:58:11,705 --> 00:58:15,977
There goes my finger. Hey, Jess,
you only need to put down one, not 50.

624
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:19,148
- Fuck you, Adam.
- Okay.

625
00:58:20,048 --> 00:58:22,784
Hey, that's weird.
The timer's still going.

626
00:58:22,884 --> 00:58:26,187
- Billie, why's the timer still going?
- What are you doing?

627
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:27,856
- What are you doing, Adam?
- Tick-tock...

628
00:58:27,956 --> 00:58:30,224
- The round ain't over.
- What are you doing?

629
00:58:30,324 --> 00:58:32,895
Someone hasn't answered.

630
00:58:32,995 --> 00:58:35,563
- Hello?
- What are you...

631
00:58:35,663 --> 00:58:37,665
I'm sorry.

632
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:40,769
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

633
00:58:40,869 --> 00:58:43,471
- I'm sorry, Mitch.
- What do you mean?

634
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:46,007
- Okay, new question.
- I'm sorry...

635
00:58:46,107 --> 00:58:48,643
Never have I ever...

636
00:58:48,743 --> 00:58:53,014
- fucked my boyfriend's best friend.
- What are you doing, Adam?

637
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:55,183
- There. You happy, Blaire?
- Why are you doing this?

638
00:58:55,283 --> 00:58:58,420
- What are you doing? Is he serious?
- Mitchie, I'm so sorry. Don't...

639
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,289
- Are you serious? He's telling the truth?
- God damn it, Adam!

640
00:59:01,389 --> 00:59:04,122
- What do you mean? What do you mean?
- It was an accident. It was an accident!

641
00:59:04,222 --> 00:59:07,262
- I didn't mean to do that.
- It was an accident? Oh, my God!

642
00:59:07,362 --> 00:59:10,265
- I was drunk, okay? It just...
- Oh, my God. What were you doing?

643
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:14,269
- I'm sorry, it just... I hate you, Adam!
- How? How? I don't get it. How?

644
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:18,473
- Fuck you, Blaire.
- Stop talking, Adam! Stop it!

645
00:59:18,573 --> 00:59:20,909
It doesn't matter, remember, Mitch?

646
00:59:21,009 --> 00:59:24,746
- It doesn't fucking matter, right?
- It does matter. It does matter, because...

647
00:59:24,846 --> 00:59:29,016
We might all fucking die, but we're
better than you, you piece of shit!

648
00:59:30,451 --> 00:59:33,614
Guys, stop. Guys, please stop.

649
00:59:43,598 --> 00:59:46,799
- Any other guy I liked treated me like shit.
- I'm gonna fucking win this thing.

650
00:59:46,899 --> 00:59:49,313
I'm gonna win this thing.
Never... never have I ever...

651
00:59:49,413 --> 00:59:52,841
Everyone's hands up! We're still playing!
We're still playing here!

652
00:59:52,941 --> 00:59:56,775
Never have I ever roofied Ashley Dane!

653
00:59:57,078 --> 00:59:59,547
- Fuck you, man! Okay?
- Guys, what are we doing?

654
00:59:59,647 --> 01:00:02,317
- Look at that! Finger's down!
- We were drunk. She's a fucking liar.

655
01:00:02,417 --> 01:00:05,686
- That's how you wanna play? All right. Fine.
- Guys, come on. Please, let's stop!

656
01:00:05,786 --> 01:00:08,523
Don't talk to me. I don't wanna hear
from you, slut. Fucking slut.

657
01:00:08,623 --> 01:00:13,094
- Don't call me that. Do not call me that.
- How many guys? How many guys?

658
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:16,597
No more, I swear! Do you think
I'm a slut? Are you kidding me?

659
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:19,732
You swear? Like you swore you love me?

660
01:00:20,768 --> 01:00:23,938
No! Mitchie, I love you!

661
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:25,706
Perfect fucking Blaire.

662
01:00:25,806 --> 01:00:28,342
You don't even know!
It only lasted, like, a second!

663
01:00:28,442 --> 01:00:31,079
- Fuck you, Blaire!
- Right, Adam?

664
01:00:31,179 --> 01:00:33,314
Why would you tell me that?
That doesn't make shit better.

665
01:00:33,414 --> 01:00:36,751
I'm sorry. I don't know
what else to say. I'm sorry.

666
01:00:36,851 --> 01:00:37,952
- Mitch, I...
- Fucking...

667
01:00:38,052 --> 01:00:42,524
Never... never have I ever forced
Ashley Dane to get an abortion!

668
01:00:42,624 --> 01:00:47,495
- Stop doing this, guys. I'm sorry, okay?
- Oh, it's four! It's four!

669
01:00:47,595 --> 01:00:51,332
- What are you...
- Don't fucking do this, man.

670
01:00:51,432 --> 01:00:54,603
Fuck you! You fucking took my girl,
and you took her for yourself.

671
01:00:54,703 --> 01:00:57,906
- No, he didn't. I'm still...
- It wasn't like that. It wasn't like that!

672
01:00:58,006 --> 01:01:02,273
- It wasn't? It wasn't like that?
- No, it wasn't! It fucking wasn't!

673
01:01:07,949 --> 01:01:12,520
Why is this happening?
Why are you showing this?

674
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:15,590
Mitchie, don't watch!
Just don't watch, okay?

675
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:19,127
Don't read into her shit, okay?
Don't watch.

676
01:01:19,227 --> 01:01:24,246
It didn't... Baby, it didn't mean anything.
I love you. Stop watching.

677
01:01:24,346 --> 01:01:27,668
Look at me, Mitch. Mitch, look at me!

678
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:31,172
I didn't mean it. Guys?

679
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:33,475
We were drunk, Mitch, okay?
It was my birthday.

680
01:01:33,575 --> 01:01:37,629
I sent you a fucking card,
you piece of shit.

681
01:01:40,481 --> 01:01:43,818
- No!
- No! Bullshit. Fuck you!

682
01:01:43,918 --> 01:01:48,723
I'm ready for you, motherfucker!
You hear me? I'm fucking ready for you!

683
01:01:48,823 --> 01:01:53,061
Come on over! Now!
I'll fucking kill you!

684
01:01:53,761 --> 01:01:55,729
I'm gonna...

685
01:01:56,631 --> 01:01:58,430
Fuck.

686
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:05,452
It's my printer.

687
01:02:10,511 --> 01:02:13,147
- Fuck! Fuck!
- What? What, Adam?

688
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,815
- What is it?
- What is it?

689
01:02:14,915 --> 01:02:16,485
- Fuck.
- What is it?

690
01:02:16,585 --> 01:02:19,253
It says I'm not supposed
to tell you what it says.

691
01:02:19,353 --> 01:02:22,957
Come on, Adam. Don't do this to us.
Don't do this to us!

692
01:02:23,057 --> 01:02:25,290
Please don't do this to us!

693
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,562
What's it say?

694
01:02:27,662 --> 01:02:31,065
Tell us right now, you piece of shit.
You fucked my girl.

695
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:34,736
- I fucking told you I loved you. Fuck...
- Mitch. You're never gonna find out, okay?

696
01:02:34,836 --> 01:02:39,226
So get your narrow fucking head
around that, you hear me?

697
01:02:44,979 --> 01:02:47,248
What's it say?

698
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:50,615
- What is it?
- I can't.

699
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:53,054
I can't.

700
01:02:53,154 --> 01:02:54,927
I can't.

701
01:02:55,027 --> 01:02:58,545
You can't? Adam and Blaire
with another secret.

702
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:01,362
- No, no, no. No. It's not like that.
- It's not like that. You don't understand.

703
01:03:01,462 --> 01:03:03,664
- I'm fucking finished. I'm signing off.
- Mitch, it's not like that, baby.

704
01:03:03,764 --> 01:03:05,733
No, no, no! She'll kill you!

705
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,368
- She'll kill you. Stop it!
- You're gonna kill me?

706
01:03:07,468 --> 01:03:10,271
If you're gonna kill me,
you better fucking kill me right now!

707
01:03:10,371 --> 01:03:13,739
No! Stop, baby. Stop, okay?
Just calm down.

708
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:17,445
Just... just calm down, okay?
Everybody just calm down.

709
01:03:17,545 --> 01:03:19,814
Okay? Everybody just...

710
01:03:19,914 --> 01:03:23,870
Baby? It's okay. It's... I'm sorry.

711
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:26,821
- I can't tell you.
- Look at me. Look at me.

712
01:03:26,921 --> 01:03:30,424
You have one minute. Say what you want.

713
01:03:30,524 --> 01:03:32,193
What?

714
01:03:32,293 --> 01:03:37,062
Okay, okay, okay. It... it just...

715
01:03:37,431 --> 01:03:41,669
We met up one more time to see
if it was a fluke or something more.

716
01:03:41,769 --> 01:03:43,804
- Where was this?
- It was at my house.

717
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:47,909
- You shut up! Where? When?
- Let me talk to him. Just let me talk to him.

718
01:03:48,009 --> 01:03:52,480
It was in September right before
we went back to school, okay?

719
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,315
We just...

720
01:03:54,415 --> 01:03:58,820
We started to do it, but then we stopped
because it was really clear, okay?

721
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,788
- It didn't... It didn't...
- She's not lying, man.

722
01:04:00,888 --> 01:04:02,557
Shut up! Shut up!

723
01:04:02,657 --> 01:04:05,527
Did he touch you again?
Did he touch you again down there?

724
01:04:06,227 --> 01:04:10,807
- Just for a second. Just for a second.
- She's not lying, Mitch. She's not, okay?

725
01:04:10,907 --> 01:04:13,000
Now show me the paper.

726
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:16,304
- You don't want me to show you the paper.
- No, I do, Blaire. Show me the paper.

727
01:04:16,404 --> 01:04:18,472
- No, Mitch, why are you doing this?
- No more fucking secrets.

728
01:04:18,572 --> 01:04:21,809
Blaire, I'm not fucking around.
Show me the paper. Or I walk!

729
01:04:21,909 --> 01:04:23,671
- I walk! That's it, Blaire.
- No, no, no! Please don't leave me!

730
01:04:23,771 --> 01:04:26,547
- Show me the paper...
- You gotta understand...

731
01:04:26,647 --> 01:04:30,218
I'm not fucking around, here!
Show me that paper!

732
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:35,022
- Sit the fuck... Get back here, Mitch!
- What are you... No, no, no!

733
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:37,758
Oh, my God!

734
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:43,093
No! No! No! No!

735
01:04:45,099 --> 01:04:47,296
Adam!

736
01:04:50,037 --> 01:04:52,848
You stupid bitch!

737
01:04:52,948 --> 01:04:56,010
- I'm sorry, Jess.
- You killed him.

738
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:02,188
I didn't know what to do.

739
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:08,222
<i>Hello. Can I share a secret with you?</i>

740
01:05:08,322 --> 01:05:11,792
<i>It's just three words. Free live cams.</i>

741
01:05:11,892 --> 01:05:13,795
<i>Free live cams are the absolute best.</i>

742
01:05:13,895 --> 01:05:18,065
<i>Having beautiful women all over the Internet
just waiting to fulfill your every desire.</i>

743
01:05:18,165 --> 01:05:21,869
- <i>There's simply nothing better than that.</i>
- I'm not gonna just sit here, guys.

744
01:05:21,969 --> 01:05:24,272
Adam... Adam was right, okay?

745
01:05:24,772 --> 01:05:28,873
We can't listen to her.
I'm gonna make this right, guys, okay?

746
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:33,311
- I didn't do anything.
- Jess, just do not answer, do not give in!

747
01:05:33,848 --> 01:05:35,650
What?

748
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:40,134
Don't answer.
Whatever you do, do not answer.

749
01:05:42,056 --> 01:05:45,093
Oh, my God! Jess? Jess, just run.

750
01:05:45,193 --> 01:05:48,028
Just hide, Jess.
Just hide in your bathroom.

751
01:05:48,128 --> 01:05:50,009
I'm gonna get you help!

752
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:00,505
God.

753
01:06:05,279 --> 01:06:08,949
Yes! Okay. Hi! Guys, listen, look at me!

754
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:11,185
Hey, look at me. Hi, hi.

755
01:06:11,285 --> 01:06:15,056
My name is Blaire Lily, and I need help.

756
01:06:15,756 --> 01:06:20,792
No! Hello! Hi! Hello!

757
01:06:21,462 --> 01:06:25,363

759
01:06:33,874 --> 01:06:35,440
No.

760
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,979
Hi. Hi.

761
01:06:41,849 --> 01:06:43,825
Can you hear me?

762
01:06:43,925 --> 01:06:46,368
Hi, can you hear me?

763
01:06:47,021 --> 01:06:51,158
Hi. Hi. My name is Blaire Lily,

764
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:54,895
- You want some? Hi. You want some?
- Hi! Hey, guys! Hello!

765
01:06:54,995 --> 01:06:56,823

01:06:56,923 --> 01:07:00,201
- Something is happening...

767
01:07:00,301 --> 01:07:04,746
- It's happening right now.
- Hey! Just... I am being attacked!

768
01:07:04,846 --> 01:07:07,408
- She's saying...
- I need you to call the police!

769
01:07:07,508 --> 01:07:10,945
- Shut up! She's being attacked!
- Please. Police, yes, the police.

770
01:07:11,045 --> 01:07:13,113
- We're gonna call the police.
- I will do anything you want.

771
01:07:13,213 --> 01:07:16,217
- Dial the Fresno, California...
- Please call them. Police!

772
01:07:16,317 --> 01:07:18,449
Stop being pricks!

773
01:07:19,386 --> 01:07:21,452
Oh, God!

774
01:07:24,892 --> 01:07:27,828
- Hello?
- Can you help me?

775
01:07:27,928 --> 01:07:29,630
- Are you okay?
- I... listen, I...

776
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:31,165
There's something happening.

777
01:07:31,265 --> 01:07:34,268
My friend is being attacked.
She needs your help.

778
01:07:34,368 --> 01:07:36,437
- How can I help? Can I help you?
- Yes, yes.

779
01:07:36,537 --> 01:07:40,474
Can you call the Fresno,
California police and tell them that...

780
01:07:40,574 --> 01:07:43,744
My name is Blaire Lily.
Look, here's her address.

781
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:47,311
- Look, look. Here's her address...
- Okay, one second.

782
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:49,847
Here.

783
01:07:50,518 --> 01:07:52,086
Okay, one minute.

784
01:07:52,186 --> 01:07:55,323
- 4478 Winslow Avenue.
- Hi, there's this girl, and she's online,

785
01:07:55,423 --> 01:07:59,894
and she says that there's someone
attacking her. She's in Fresno, California.

786
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:04,365
- Who's attacking you?
- Who? I don't know.

787
01:08:04,465 --> 01:08:06,067
- There's something in my house...
- She's just yelling a lot.

788
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:07,668
...and we're being attacked.

789
01:08:07,768 --> 01:08:10,171
She says there's something in her house
and she's being attacked,

790
01:08:10,271 --> 01:08:13,552
and it's her boyfriend
and all of her friends.

791
01:08:15,876 --> 01:08:18,712
- Just tell them to come to that address.
- You know who's attacking you?

792
01:08:18,812 --> 01:08:22,584
Okay. She says just come to the address.
Wait, what is it again?

793
01:08:23,584 --> 01:08:26,620
- What's the address?
- Yes... I'm sending it to you right now.

794
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,799
Sorry, one minute.

795
01:08:31,258 --> 01:08:33,709
I... I just...

796
01:08:34,929 --> 01:08:39,867
Okay. So the address
is 4478 Winslow Avenue.

797
01:08:39,967 --> 01:08:44,202
- And she said it was in Fresno, California.
- Tell them to get here! Are they coming?

798
01:08:45,472 --> 01:08:48,175
- Are you...
- They're going to send a car.

799
01:08:48,275 --> 01:08:52,488
- They are? They are? Thank you!
- Okay. Okay, great.

800
01:08:52,588 --> 01:08:56,984
- Yeah, they said they're five minutes away.
- They're five minutes? Okay. Okay.

801
01:08:57,084 --> 01:09:00,187
Okay, Jess. There's a car coming.
The cops are coming.

802
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,756
They're going to be there in 5 minutes.

803
01:09:01,856 --> 01:09:04,689
- Why are they taking so much...
- The cops are coming.

804
01:09:07,061 --> 01:09:08,663
What?

805
01:09:08,763 --> 01:09:11,432
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Jess?

806
01:09:11,532 --> 01:09:16,067
Jess! Jess! Just run.
Jess, just run, okay? Just...

807
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

808
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:30,548
Jess!

809
01:09:39,293 --> 01:09:41,896
No. Jess? Jess?

810
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:51,035
No! No! Oh, my God!

811
01:09:54,174 --> 01:09:55,907
What?

812
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:08,385
I'm so...

813
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:16,961
Oh, my God!

814
01:10:21,335 --> 01:10:23,168
Mitch?

815
01:10:25,706 --> 01:10:27,672
Oh, my God.

816
01:10:31,245 --> 01:10:33,513
Oh, my God!

817
01:10:41,355 --> 01:10:43,621
What are you doing?

818
01:11:11,214 --> 01:11:13,051
Mitchie.

819
01:11:18,592 --> 01:11:20,658
Do you see...

820
01:11:33,641 --> 01:11:36,643
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

821
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:43,648
What is that?

822
01:11:44,952 --> 01:11:48,789
It's an alarm I set for tomorrow.
We have a test.

823
01:11:48,889 --> 01:11:52,156
- We do?
- Yeah, it's...

824
01:11:52,926 --> 01:11:55,633
Mitch, do you hate me?

825
01:11:57,231 --> 01:11:59,142
- I don't hate you, Blaire.
- You don't?

826
01:11:59,242 --> 01:12:01,001
No, I don't hate you.
I love you so much.

827
01:12:01,101 --> 01:12:02,704
I love you.

828
01:12:09,276 --> 01:12:12,379
- That wasn't us, Laura!
- Laura, please.

829
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:15,749
It was not us, I promise you.
It wasn't us.

830
01:12:15,849 --> 01:12:17,715
It wasn't us.

831
01:12:20,554 --> 01:12:23,615
Please, Laura. It wasn't us!

832
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:31,348
- I'm scared.
- Laura, I promise you.

833
01:13:30,624 --> 01:13:31,817
Mitch!

834
01:13:38,265 --> 01:13:42,000
Why did you do... Mitch? Mitch?

835
01:13:43,403 --> 01:13:46,000
Mitch!

836
01:13:48,241 --> 01:13:49,877
What?

837
01:13:49,977 --> 01:13:53,102
Guys, I'm so sorry! Why did you do that?

838
01:13:53,202 --> 01:13:56,247
Why did... what... who was...

839
01:14:00,921 --> 01:14:02,753
What?

840
01:14:03,256 --> 01:14:05,122
What?

841
01:14:11,965 --> 01:14:15,869
No, no, no. Why are you
still counting down?

842
01:14:15,969 --> 01:14:18,168
Why are you...

843
01:14:18,605 --> 01:14:20,941
What do you want from me?

844
01:14:21,341 --> 01:14:24,149
What do you think I did?

845
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:35,692
We were sisters, Laura.
Don't you know it? I loved you.

846
01:14:35,792 --> 01:14:37,655
Look.

847
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:43,127
Look at us. No, look at us.
Look! Look at us.

848
01:14:44,231 --> 01:14:47,465
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?

849
01:14:52,272 --> 01:14:55,277
I'm so sorry we drifted apart.

850
01:15:02,049 --> 01:15:03,848
What?

851
01:15:16,463 --> 01:15:18,196
No!

852
01:15:44,892 --> 01:15:46,793
<i>I got her.</i>

853
01:15:46,893 --> 01:15:48,926
I'm sorry.

854
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
No!

855
01:16:35,242 --> 01:16:36,741
Laura?
