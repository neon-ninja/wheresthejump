1
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:57,056
I really need to...

2
00:00:58,623 --> 00:00:59,757
Hold it.

3
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:13,072
Don't look!

4
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,254
I love you.

5
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,162
You don't have to say it back.

6
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:38,763
I'm sorry. I just...

7
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,932
I love you.

8
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:01,919
They're not as nihilistic

9
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:03,188
as they look on the internet.

10
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:06,024
That's just, like,
what they want you to think.

11
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:09,228
So, David thinks
you're a childhood friend.

12
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:12,431
Mmm-hmm. Yeah,
he actually was, um,

13
00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:14,899
my preschool boyfriend.

14
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:17,768
Of course, before I realized
that I was a raging dyke.

15
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,240
Wow.

16
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:25,910
They all look so impressive.

17
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:27,412
You're impressive.

18
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:28,813
Yeah, sure.

19
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:30,082
I'm serious.

20
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:34,019
Jordan is going
to be obsessed with you.

21
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:36,455
So...

22
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:46,064
Who is that?

23
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,900
My mom.

24
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,309
You little freak.

25
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:59,478
I'm... I'm not. I just...

26
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:00,945
She's gonna be fine, all right?

27
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:03,748
It's okay to be nervous.

28
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:06,851
That's part of the fun.

29
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:35,447
Ugh, this fucking window.

30
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,503
It's gonna be so fun!

31
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:19,857
You coming?

32
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,094
Yeah. Um...

33
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:23,495
I forgot something in the car.

34
00:04:24,429 --> 00:04:25,430
Okay...

35
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:27,765
Don't take too long.

36
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,068
Your game.

37
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,154
Oh, my God!

38
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:57,228
Surprise, bitches!

39
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:59,458
Oh, my God!

40
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:01,293
You fucking whore!

41
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:08,443
What the fuck?
It's Sophie.

42
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:09,601
Bitch!
Oh...

43
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:10,669
What is she doing here?

44
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:12,104
- I don't know.
- Oh, oh...

45
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:13,672
Hello!

46
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:16,441
You got me soaking
wet, you bad little girl.

47
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:19,478
- Come here...
- Whoo, boy!

48
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:20,579
Hey, did I win?

49
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:21,513
Yes, Greg.

50
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:23,315
I told you guys.
I got really big lungs!

51
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:24,349
I know.

52
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:48,073
Oh, my God.

53
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:49,250
I can't believe
you're here, like,

54
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:50,308
last time I saw you,

55
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:51,586
you were coked out
on the subway,

56
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,311
pissing on the floor
like a little hyena.

57
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:54,979
I thought you
were an NYU student.

58
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,548
Oh, my God.

59
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,251
And that is why we do not let
the Henny monster out anymore.

60
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:01,219
No, no!

61
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,654
Okay, but, seriously,
how are you?

62
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,456
I'm good. Yeah.
Yeah?

63
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,558
Yeah, I'm, like, really good.
Good. Good.

64
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:08,460
You look so good.

65
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:10,328
I miss you!
I miss you too.

66
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:12,997
Also, I have to say,
love the podcast.

67
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:15,300
Okay, we have a fan of the pod.

68
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,701
We love the podcast.

69
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,969
A fan of the pod.

70
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,639
Oh, my God!
It's so good to see you!

71
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:23,074
I can't believe that
you're here! It's, like, what?

72
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:26,311
Hi. Hi, I'm Emma.
Hi.

73
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:28,246
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

74
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,048
That was so rude of me.
I'm Alice.

75
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:32,651
You guys, this is Bee.

76
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:34,085
Bee, this is everyone.

77
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,196
That's David, my best friend

78
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,755
in the whole, whole,
whole wide world.

79
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:38,056
That's Emma.

80
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:39,524
That's Jordan, and...

81
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,594
'Sup! I'm Greg.

82
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,429
'Sup, player! I'm Sophie.

83
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,164
Oh!

84
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:49,234
Whoa. You're Sophie?

85
00:07:57,108 --> 00:07:59,044
Real nice of you
to make it, Soph.

86
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:01,379
Ooh, spicy, spicy, Jordan.

87
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:03,215
What is that supposed to mean?

88
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:05,183
Just means that
we have all been here

89
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:07,452
and nobody had any fucking
clue that you were coming.

90
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,020
Let alone, an hour before

91
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:10,589
the storm is supposed
to start, so...

92
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:14,459
What? I totally
told you guys

93
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,494
that I was coming.

94
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:17,529
And I texted you.

95
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:18,730
In the group chat?
Yeah.

96
00:08:18,763 --> 00:08:19,798
No, you didn't.
Whatever,

97
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:23,702
you guys know that I'm
useless with text, right?

98
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:24,846
Also, we meant
to come up yesterday,

99
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,539
but then Bee got scheduled
for a shift at work, so...

100
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:29,441
Oh, where do you work?

101
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:32,110
- Game Hut.
- Oh, nice.

102
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:33,712
Why are you guys being so weird?

103
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:35,280
Are you talking about me?

104
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:37,682
What are you doing with that champagne?
- Guys!

105
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:39,660
You know you're not supposed
to touch my dad's shit.

106
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:41,653
Sophie is here.
Okay, it's Sophie.

107
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,255
It's a once in a
millennium sighting.

108
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:44,356
- We're doing it.
- No.

109
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:45,590
Yes, come on.

110
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:47,726
- Who wants to pop it?
- I'll do it.

111
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,437
Greg, you'll help me pop it?
Yeah, I'll pop it.

112
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:50,529
Okay.
Yeah.

113
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:52,297
I, um...

114
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,465
I brought something.

115
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,235
Oh! What, uh... What is it?

116
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:00,705
It's, uh, zucchini. A bread.

117
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:03,275
- It's zucchini bread.
- Thank you.

118
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:04,576
Yum.

119
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:06,111
- Hey, nerds.
- That's sweet.

120
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:12,551
Oh, my, God! Oh, my God!

121
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:14,419
How did you do that?

122
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:15,587
Did you see that?
All right.

123
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,864
It's not that cool.
That was crazy.

124
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:18,323
Oh, my God!

125
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:19,524
Wow.
Wow.

126
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:22,127
That was so sick. I can't
believe we didn't video that.

127
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,337
Give me my dad's Gurkha sword.

128
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:24,429
Gimme that.
Here, man.

129
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:26,340
Fuck, that was so good.
I just found it on the wall.

130
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:28,166
Yeah, don't grab
shit off my wall.

131
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:29,501
Whoa! Eh, careful
with that pour,

132
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:31,202
the shits expensive.

133
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:33,338
All right, all right.
There we go. There we go.

134
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:34,639
Thanks.
Really impressive.

135
00:09:34,673 --> 00:09:36,107
Nice pouring.

136
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:38,143
Soph, you want?
I'm sober.

137
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,179
Yay!
No, thanks.

138
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:42,781
Congrats.

139
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,616
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

140
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:46,160
To hurricanes!

141
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:47,519
To hurricane parties!

142
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:49,454
- Yeah.
- To hurricanes.

143
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:50,755
To hurricanes.

144
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:51,823
Deep.

145
00:09:57,662 --> 00:09:59,497
Guys it's starting!

146
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:04,369
Party time!

147
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:05,537
Starting.

148
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:07,806
Shit. Fuck.

149
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:13,211
Okay, what's going on with Max?

150
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:14,080
Nothing.
Where is he?

151
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:16,247
He's just taking a break.
He'll be back.

152
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:17,349
What does that mean?

153
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:21,853
Is that all you got,
motherfucker!

154
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:29,761
Let's go!

155
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,274
Hey, fuck face!

156
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:44,409
Can we talk for a second?

157
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:46,745
Can you knock?
No, it's my house.

158
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,580
Sure. What's up?

159
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:50,448
In private.
Oh!

160
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:51,583
Sure.

161
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:54,552
I'm sorry. He'll learn.

162
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:56,588
I'll be right back.

163
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,661
Yeah, that's what
Tom Hanks said in <i>Castaway.</i>

164
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,459
<i>She's actually really cute.</i>

165
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,862
In like a school shooter
type of way.

166
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:07,365
"Brought you
zucchini bread, Dave."

167
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,733
She's mine. Hands off.

168
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:28,319
Hey.

169
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:32,457
Oh, hi... I...

170
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,392
Uh, I was just...
No, no, I know.

171
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:37,829
It's beautiful. The house.

172
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:40,198
Sophie's parents have one
that's even bigger.

173
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:46,771
Just be careful, okay?

174
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:50,442
With Sophie. Just...

175
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,979
be careful.

176
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,815
Okay.

177
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,385
Okay.

178
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:11,830
But he's, like, not hot.
You know what I mean?

179
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:12,964
He's like, like, your mom

180
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:14,499
would be like,
"Ooh, he's hot."

181
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:16,835
Not your mom,
I mean moms in general.

182
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:17,736
Moms that have been married

183
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:19,671
for like 10, 15 years
and they see, like,

184
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:21,339
him going out of a Starbucks...

185
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:23,575
Alice got to bring someone
without telling anyone.

186
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:24,542
So you do read the chat.

187
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,644
Why is everyone
so obsessed with the chat?

188
00:12:26,678 --> 00:12:28,756
Now, you're here. I'm here,
we're here together, right?

189
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,449
Why are we worrying
about the chat?

190
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:32,917
When we can just
live in the moment.

191
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:33,995
Yeah, it's 'cause
you went to rehab

192
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,054
and you're not on drugs.

193
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:35,954
So, like, everything is like,

194
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:39,424
"Ooh, why don't
we just all be cool, man?"

195
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,360
You have a little problem
with Greg?

196
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:44,796
The lumberjack.

197
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:45,864
It's a new pod.

198
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:48,433
I'm not used
to the inhaling yet.

199
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,768
What is he, like, 40?

200
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,079
I don't know.
I think Alice found him

201
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,704
on Tinder, or some shit.

202
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,839
Apparently, he was
in Afghanistan.

203
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:57,442
I think he was in the Army,
or some shit, so...

204
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:58,676
Well, that's hot.

205
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,578
He's not...
He's not, like, that hot.

206
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:01,856
You don't have to think
he's attractive,

207
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,591
only Alice has to think
that he's attractive.

208
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,849
Like, I feel, like,

209
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:06,885
I'm more attractive than that.

210
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:09,420
You do?
Absolutely.

211
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:10,688
And what are the features

212
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:11,866
that you're bringing
to the table?

213
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,324
Well, I just look like I fuck.

214
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:14,759
You know what I mean?
Mmm.

215
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,861
I look like I... I fuck.

216
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:18,997
And that's the vibe
I like to put out there.

217
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,832
Yeah.
No, uh, yeah,

218
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:22,676
he's, he's really handsome.
Whatever.

219
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,478
I mean, we don't have to
talk about it all the time.

220
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:25,880
What the fuck
happened to your face?

221
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:26,771
Fucking Max.

222
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,574
Max did that?
Yes, fucking Max, really.

223
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:30,684
Okay? I was standing outside

224
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,087
and he just ran up to me
and punched me in the eye.

225
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,287
Just ran up to you?
He just did.

226
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,990
Look at it. He just came
up to you and did that, huh?

227
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,390
I think it...
actually think it looks

228
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:38,117
kind of dope, though.
Don't you think?

229
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,618
It's getting fucking darker.

230
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:42,921
I look like a,
like a warrior. Right?

231
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:44,498
Like, it's kind of...
It's kind of cool.

232
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:45,690
Like, it's kind of hot.

233
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:47,102
Like, if you saw me
coming out of a 7-Eleven,

234
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,394
you'd be like...

235
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:52,463
Um...

236
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:54,866
So have you had a chance to, uh,

237
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,434
talk to my parents at all?

238
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:01,673
What the fuck
are you doing here, Soph?

239
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:04,909
I missed you.

240
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:06,811
We both know that's a lie.

241
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,446
Nobody's ever missed me.

242
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:54,059
Ugh, no! Please, no!

243
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:00,465
Ugh, my God,
can you turn that off?

244
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:01,833
It's bumming me out.

245
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:05,004
Yeah. You're right.
You're right.

246
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,805
Hey, guys, can I...
Can I get on the Wi-Fi?

247
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,475
Oh, God, I can never
remember the password.

248
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,677
It's, like, an actually
good password.

249
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,430
I'll transfer it.
What's your email?

250
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:16,547
Uh... What?

251
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:18,150
What is your email?

252
00:15:19,817 --> 00:15:21,953
Hey...

253
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:25,957
I'm sorry.
My service went out,

254
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,792
but I am on a Wi-Fi now.

255
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:30,662
So, that's good.

256
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:33,165
I 100% wanna do a
TikTok. All of you can do it.

257
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,035
Okay. Do you know this?
Which one is it?

258
00:15:37,502 --> 00:15:38,679
I don't know what I'm doing.

259
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:39,981
Follow...
We'll watch it...

260
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,606
You'll catch it. Yeah.

261
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,676
Okay, ready, three, two...

262
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,711
Keep up, keep up.

263
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:48,213
- Go!
- Look at you.

264
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,285
Are we at the last part?

265
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,254
That was
good. That was good. Okay.

266
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,822
Greg went a little rogue
but we're checking the moves.

267
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,958
No, you didn't.
Again, again, again.

268
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:01,269
At the end you go like this.

269
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,095
Ready? Get ready.
You okay?

270
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,030
We should just, just post it.

271
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:05,997
It's very good.

272
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,675
I'm ready for
the flow. One more time!

273
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:08,800
Three, two, one, go!

274
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,102
Do you want a drink?

275
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,203
Do you want something?

276
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,770
Here you go. There we go!

277
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:15,640
She's having a good time.

278
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:16,741
Let's go!

279
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:19,144
Yeah! Oh, my God.

280
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,611
Okay, bitch.

281
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,248
I make it very salty.

282
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,716
It's incredibly salty.

283
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,785
Is this your first relationship?

284
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,923
Uh, no.

285
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,925
You just, kind of,
give that vibe.

286
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:37,062
- Not in a bad way.
- Yeah.

287
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,763
How long have
you guys been together?

288
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:40,765
Oh, uh, six weeks.

289
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:42,867
Nice.
Wow.

290
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,736
Six weeks with Sophie.

291
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:47,006
Alice.
In a good way, that's good.

292
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,673
Are you from Moscow?

293
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,575
No.
Oh.

294
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:51,709
Why?

295
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:54,545
<i>Doctor Zhivago</i>
is my favorite film.

296
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:55,980
Ugh, my God,

297
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,548
what is going on
with this storm?

298
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:59,318
I'm, like, make up your mind.

299
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,552
I want it to start,
like, pouring again

300
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:04,555
so that we can go fucking crazy.

301
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:07,825
Oh, you know that has
weed in it, right?

302
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,861
Not a lot,
I just wanted to let you know.

303
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:11,863
Just didn't want you
to go to town and then...

304
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,341
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

305
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:17,869
Ooh, we're getting
a lot of likes.

306
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,636
Ow! Ow!
What the fuck?

307
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,843
David! Ow! What the fuck?

308
00:17:58,876 --> 00:17:59,877
Oh, my God!

309
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,649
Are you being an incel?

310
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:06,318
I'm coked up and I bit her.

311
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,237
Excuse me.

312
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,209
So did you, um...

313
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,911
Did you go to college
here in the States, or, um...

314
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:38,083
Yeah, here...
I, I mean, in Utah State.

315
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,318
You need to chill out.

316
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:40,385
I guess.

317
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,986
No, I'm serious, you need to...

318
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,355
You need to chill out.

319
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:47,059
I'm just really sweaty
and I need to hydrate myself.

320
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,127
Okay?

321
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,296
You should watch your girl.

322
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,966
Looks like she's
having fun with Jordan.

323
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,298
Silence!

324
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,999
What? Stop!

325
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,800
Who wants to play
Bodies Bodies Bodies?

326
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,237
- Ah, fuck!
- Yes!

327
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,306
So, if you draw
the piece of paper

328
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,973
that has the "X" on it,

329
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,975
you are the murderer.

330
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,810
And you have
to keep it a secret.

331
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:42,447
Guys, I get so stressed out
every time we play this.

332
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,848
Someone always ends up crying.

333
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:45,217
You always end up crying.

334
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,153
Okay, I can access
my emotions easily.

335
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,921
Very incredibly easily.

336
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:51,822
She's an actress,
she always cries first.

337
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,028
I'm just saying,
this game gets very ugly.

338
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,728
Oh, my God, no, it does not.

339
00:19:57,762 --> 00:20:00,132
It gets ugly
when she ugly cries.

340
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,134
Literally, every single
time we play,

341
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,168
people start fighting.

342
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,237
Yeah, well, that's
what makes it fun, Emma.

343
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,243
Where's Max?

344
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,977
He's not responding to my texts.

345
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,246
Oh, Jesus...

346
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,521
So, how do you play?

347
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,424
So, I'm gonna
hit the lights in a second.

348
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,059
And if you are the murderer,

349
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,494
you have to sneak around
and kill someone

350
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,862
by, like, touching them
on the back.

351
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:35,467
And then, everyone else
has to avoid being killed.

352
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,336
And then, if you are killed,

353
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,539
you have to fall down
and pretend you're dead.

354
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,107
Like this.

355
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,176
Cool.

356
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,178
Hey, uh...
Alice, do you wanna...

357
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,247
- What?
- Do you wanna...

358
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,748
You know.
Oh! Excuse me, I have to go.

359
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,451
It's an emergency.

360
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,087
Excuse me.

361
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,264
The most important part

362
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,257
is if you do come across a body,

363
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,225
you have to yell,
"Bodies, bodies, bodies."

364
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,460
And then, once that happens,

365
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,827
we'll turn all
the lights back on

366
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,163
and then we'll try
to figure out who did it.

367
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,498
Could you hold this?

368
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,100
Did Greg touch that?

369
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,167
Oh, my God.

370
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,103
You're being such a dick
about Greg.

371
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,537
Just hold this.

372
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,840
David...

373
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:17,442
What?
I, ugh...

374
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:24,283
Okay...

375
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,020
Look, what the fuck's going on?

376
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,454
Come to the floor.

377
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,522
Come to the floor.

378
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,524
Get your ass over here, boy.

379
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,927
Okay.
All right.

380
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:38,163
Who will do the honors?

381
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,365
Oh...

382
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,800
Get into it. Let's go.

383
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:44,902
Ow!

384
00:21:44,935 --> 00:21:47,439
Ahhh!

385
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,341
Bitch.

386
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,409
Are you mad at me?

387
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,722
- No.
- Okay.

388
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:54,879
- Ow!
- Jordan!

389
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:56,248
Whoa.
What? It's the game.

390
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,516
Wowza...

391
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,636
Oh, my God...
Oh, come on!

392
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,903
What was that?
Bee!

393
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:19,946
You have to hit more.
You got to put

394
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,007
some muscle into it.
You gotta... Yeah, go for it.

395
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,041
Yeah.

396
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:25,910
Come on!

397
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:27,021
Slap him around, he deserves it.

398
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,013
Fucking hit me!

399
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,115
- He wants it.
- No, he deserves it.

400
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:31,083
He really deserves it. Do it.

401
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,493
If anyone deserves
to be hit, it should be him.

402
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,353
- Yeah.
- Okay.

403
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,054
Oh, for fuck sake like this.

404
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,622
Oh, my God!

405
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,491
David!
David.

406
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,394
See?
David.

407
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,098
You're a fucking dick!

408
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,599
What?

409
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,334
You are such an asshole.

410
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,511
I'm teaching her
how to play the game.

411
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,969
Baby, stop, stop!

412
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,005
Wait, guys,
someone has to hit me.

413
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,574
Who's gonna hit me?

414
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,874
I'll do it.

415
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,977
Ow!

416
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,913
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

417
00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:03,948
Okay!

418
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:05,983
- Are we ready to go?
- Yes, let's fucking go.

419
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,537
- Yes.
- Let's play the game.

420
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,298
Holy shit!
I'm so fucked up.

421
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,424
Ahh.

422
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,163
You ready?

423
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,531
Yes.

424
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,308
Hey.

425
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh!

426
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,189
I see white man...

427
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,790
Bodies, bodies, bodies!

428
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:32,764
You guys! Over here.

429
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:37,569
No!

430
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,404
All right,
who tried to take advantage

431
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,239
of my body in the dark?

432
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,707
Your wish, babe.

433
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:46,478
Oh, why, God?
Why? He was so hot!

434
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:49,381
Was it you?
No.

435
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,250
Okay. So, do we have
any nominations?

436
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,752
Emma Whoa.

437
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,754
Wow, coming in hot.
What?

438
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,390
Why?
Yup, I think it was Emma.

439
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,191
Why do you think it was me?

440
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,393
Yeah, David, why?

441
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:02,861
Okay, well, she just, like,

442
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,597
agrees with everything
that everybody is saying.

443
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,799
And that's her strategy
in this game

444
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,501
and it works every single time.

445
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,169
So, I'm just calling it now.
It's Emma.

446
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,138
Do we have
any other nominations?

447
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,307
Um... Yeah, David.

448
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,851
Oh, come on.
It's low hanging fruit.

449
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,577
I mean, he who casts
the first stone.

450
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,345
Guys, why isn't he moving?

451
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,683
Greg?
Baby, get up.

452
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,485
You don't have to keep
pretending for this long.

453
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,121
Baby?
Come on, Greg.

454
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,156
Greg...

455
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,691
Greg...

456
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:34,726
Get up.

457
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,661
Wait.

458
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,666
Greg?

459
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,402
Greg!

460
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,904
Greg, get up!

461
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,339
Greg! He's not getting up.

462
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,708
Hey, relax,
this always works. I know.

463
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,344
Oh, hey!
Oh, my God.

464
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,347
You really scared me with that.

465
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,450
You're a little trickster, Greg.

466
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,151
I know, Jesus Christ.

467
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,220
Cute.

468
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,923
Okay, so... what about David?

469
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,726
Wait, maybe it's Jordan.

470
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,837
She's always really aggressive
when she's the killer.

471
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,229
There you go.
What? No, I am not.

472
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,230
You're lying.

473
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,232
Your voice always goes
really high when you lie.

474
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,234
No, it doesn't.
I... It... I've...

475
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,303
It's definitely David.
Why are you yelling?

476
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,513
That would be so fucking obvious

477
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,339
if I were the killer,
which I'm not.

478
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,483
I think you're digging yourself

479
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,942
into a little hole here, Dave.

480
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,578
Guys, Jesus Christ...

481
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,446
The best defense
is a good offense.

482
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,757
Hey, you shut up. You're not
supposed to talk. You're dead.

483
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:30,858
The dead are actually
not supposed to speak.

484
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,660
Oh, yeah, you... Sorry, baby,
you can't. It's a rule.

485
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,719
Oh, my B.
Yeah, no talking. Pack it up.

486
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,593
What the fuck
does that even mean, Greg?

487
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,256
What's up?

488
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,291
"The best defense
is a good offense."

489
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,293
What does that...
What does that mean?

490
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,530
Oh, you know, the best
defense is a good offense.

491
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,669
What...
What does it mean, though?

492
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,472
Uh, well...

493
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,776
It, um... It means
that the best defense

494
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,545
is a good offense.

495
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,614
Right, right, I heard you.

496
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:05,950
But, what does it mean
to you, Greg? Like...

497
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,787
I don't know, could you
elaborate on it for us?

498
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,321
Break it down.

499
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,823
Yeah, sure.

500
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,292
So, hey, look in sports,
there's...

501
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,661
Oh, my God.

502
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,296
You are such a fucking dick.

503
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,698
Hey, this is a teaching moment.

504
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:24,703
Oh, I see.

505
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:26,971
You're fucking with me.

506
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:28,940
No. No,

507
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,408
I'm not fucking with you, Greg.

508
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,644
I'm just having fun.

509
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,879
We're all just
having a good time.

510
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,281
Right, guys?

511
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,216
Right, Greg?

512
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:48,927
We're just having fun.

513
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,907
You know,

514
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,376
I think it's time for me
to put myself to bed.

515
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,379
- Oh, come on, Greg.
- Greg, no.

516
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,748
Good night, Greg.

517
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,583
You kids have fun.

518
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,284
Catch you later, player.

519
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,419
By the way,

520
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,321
can I just point
all of our attention

521
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,723
to the fact that Emma
hasn't said a fucking word.

522
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,960
Whoa, you're right.

523
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,028
Whoa, she hasn't!

524
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:25,563
I'm just pointing out
the obvious. That's all.

525
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,365
Look, she's doing
that swallowing thing.

526
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:28,809
She always does that
when she's fucking nervous!

527
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:29,844
Oh, my God!
Look, look!

528
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,370
Oh, my God, you're doing it.
You're swallowing it.

529
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,339
- I'm not.
- You are.

530
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,008
Okay, I love you,
but when you swallow,

531
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,509
it's just fucking...
Like, why?

532
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,743
Swallowing is normal.

533
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,887
- It's a normal thing to do.
- Yeah...

534
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,822
It's very un-attractive.
I don't know why you do it?

535
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:45,316
Oh, my God. Is that why
you guys never have sex?

536
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,452
What?
Alice.

537
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:51,589
What? It's not a bad thing.
Some people have sex a lot.

538
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,557
Some people have it less.

539
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,460
Alice, what are you
talking about? We do.

540
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,395
I have it a lot. Some...

541
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:58,706
- Are you fucking...
- Oh, my God.

542
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,610
Are you fucking talking
about us behind my back?

543
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,068
No.
Yes.

544
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:04,402
No.
Yes.

545
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,504
No, I'm not.

546
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:07,739
I'm not! I'm not.

547
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:08,783
- I just...
- That's just great.

548
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,443
No, I... We...
I... You never really... I...

549
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,379
I don't...
You're always gas lighting me.

550
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,024
"Gaslight," shut up.
It's a fucking dumb word.

551
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,216
Excuse me?

552
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,851
Gaslight is, like, one of
the most over used words ever,

553
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,087
to, like, the point
of annihilation.

554
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:24,522
Okay, it doesn't mean
anything other than the fact

555
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,025
that, like,
you read the internet.

556
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,526
Or, like, "Congrats,
you have a Twitter account."

557
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,695
Ugh, that is so fucking lame.

558
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:31,806
"Gaslight," get over it.

559
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,632
Like what's next? You're
gonna call me a narcissist?

560
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,468
Or a foot soldier of,
like, the white supremacy?

561
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,504
Like, come on, fucking,
be more original.

562
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,772
Lame.

563
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:41,816
What? I'm just saying,
that, this is what I'm saying,

564
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,584
she doesn't have a thought
in her fucking head

565
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,411
that hasn't been said
by anybody else.

566
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,080
Nothing that isn't preordained.

567
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:51,649
David, that's really mean.

568
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,384
Look, she's crying.

569
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,586
What?

570
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,796
Why is everybody
looking at me like that?

571
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,755
This is not her real cry.

572
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:00,925
I vote David.

573
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,428
Yeah, me too.

574
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,130
Are you fucking serious?

575
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:06,464
Guys, it's Emma.

576
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,001
She's an actress.
She's acting.

577
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:10,802
Third.

578
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,737
Wow, how fucking surprising.

579
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,706
Yeah, look at your
quivering upper lip.

580
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,875
Like, we all didn't see you
in <i>Hedda Gabler.</i> Fuck you.

581
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,676
Yeah, yeah, yup... Fourth.

582
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,115
Oh, my God.

583
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,515
Fuck this game!

584
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,554
Holy shit.

585
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,892
Relationships can
be really complicated.

586
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,696
Are you okay?

587
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,099
I'm fine.
Are you sure?

588
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,634
I'm fine. I'm 100% fine.
Are you sure, baby?

589
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,136
Yes. Let's play.

590
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,038
Ow!

591
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,706
Wow, good one.

592
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,676
All of a sudden
she loves the game.

593
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,878
That was crazy.

594
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:57,415
Give it to me.

595
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:00,818
Damn!

596
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,089
Ah! Oh, my God!

597
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:05,157
What was that?

598
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,934
- What the fuck?
- Is that the lights?

599
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:07,992
What was that?

600
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:08,993
- Oh, my God.
- Was that from the storm?

601
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:11,030
Oh, my God.
I bet you that it was David.

602
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:12,764
David! JORDAN: It's
not David. Come on.

603
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:13,831
I'm texting him.

604
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,733
David, are you fucking with us?

605
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,236
Turn the lights back on.

606
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,038
Hey, does anybody have service?

607
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:20,139
No!

608
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,806
Ugh, wait, mine's not working.

609
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,641
Okay, I think
the WiFi is also down.

610
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,944
Oh, my God, I'm
gonna fucking kill him.

611
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,579
Great!
David!

612
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,016
David! This is
real fucking cute!

613
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,097
Soph, can he disable
the generator from garage,

614
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,023
or the basement, or whatever?

615
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:40,059
I don't know.

616
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,594
David!

617
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,764
Okay, well, I'm gonna
go and flip the breaker.

618
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,509
Is it in the garage
or is it in the basement?

619
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,734
- David!
- Soph?

620
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:50,979
- Huh, what?
- Okay, whatever.

621
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:53,005
Okay, I'm gonna go
get some more flashlights.

622
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,772
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

623
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,807
Where is a bathroom?

624
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,910
Um, uh, downstairs,
first door on your right.

625
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:00,845
Going there.

626
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:06,985
David?

627
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,624
David, are you fucking with us?

628
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

629
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,290
I meant the other stairs.

630
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:26,331
David! David!

631
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,903
Help! Somebody help!

632
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,339
No, no, no.

633
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,141
What the fuck happened?

634
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,910
Oh, my God! Why would...

635
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,313
- Check his pulse.
- What the fuck?

636
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,248
Oh, fuck!
Oh, my God!

637
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:44,349
Hold his head up!

638
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:47,052
Oh, my God!
Fuck!

639
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,388
- Fuck!
- Is he dying?

640
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,823
- Hold his head up!
- Come on, baby, hold on.

641
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,368
What the fuck
happened to his neck?

642
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:55,060
I love you, David.
Shit.

643
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,029
What is happening?

644
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,299
Shit!

645
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:02,034
What are you doing?
I'm calling 911!

646
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,235
Oh, my God! You have service?

647
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,769
Fuck, no! Do you?

648
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:05,970
- No!
- Shit!

649
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:07,805
Where are you going?
Landline!

650
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,274
We should move his body?

651
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,742
Why?
I don't know. Because he's...

652
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,977
No, you can't move him.

653
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:14,779
Did you watch <i>SVU?</i>
It's evidence.

654
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,849
- Of what?
- Cause!

655
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,817
Landline?
No, there's no connection.

656
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,652
Sophie, where are your keys?

657
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,021
Your keys, Sophie,
where are they?

658
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:23,988
They're in the pocket.

659
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:25,857
They're in her pocket...
Where? Fucking help!

660
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,858
Where are you going?

661
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,194
- I'm going to the car.
- To the car? Why?

662
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:30,795
To get some fucking help.

663
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,197
Wait, do you have a license?

664
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:33,664
Doesn't she not have a license?

665
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,200
I don't know.
I don't think so.

666
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:37,069
- Fuck!
- He's dead!

667
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,836
You have to go!
I don't know!

668
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:41,140
He stopped breathing!

669
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,198
Branch!

670
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,122
You have to push the gas.

671
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:32,257
I know how
to fucking drive, Alice!

672
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,126
- I can't see.
- Is the battery dead?

673
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:37,728
- Oh, no...
- What?

674
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:40,165
I, I think I left the light on,
on the mirror.

675
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,967
Oh, Jesus Christ.

676
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,769
What the fuck
are we supposed to do?

677
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,305
Wait, where are your cars?

678
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:48,040
We...
We only have one car.

679
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:50,775
Max picked us all up
and he fucking left!

680
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:54,213
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

681
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:07,825
Max will probably
be here any minute, right?

682
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:08,960
Where's Jordan?

683
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:12,297
She went to check
the generator, I...

684
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:15,400
What the fuck was he doing?

685
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,478
- What are you talking about?
- Fuck was he doing?

686
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:20,105
Why the fuck was he
outside in the storm?

687
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,216
Hey!
It's me, let me in!

688
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:40,392
I found this.

689
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,128
Outside in the mud.

690
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:51,436
Don't touch it

691
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,239
Um, does the security system
work if the power goes out?

692
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:55,973
Um...

693
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:58,477
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it does.

694
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,977
David's dad explained it to us.

695
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:01,122
Nobody can get in
without the code.

696
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:02,314
Well, Max has the code.

697
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,316
So...
Max wouldn't...

698
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:07,352
I'm just saying, like,
where the fuck is he?

699
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:09,221
Couldn't he have come back
after last night?

700
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,821
Alice, stop.

701
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,360
What happened last night?

702
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:16,961
- Nothing.
- No.

703
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,463
We did shrooms

704
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:21,966
and Max told everybody
that he was in love with Emma.

705
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,269
Which David thought
was beautiful in the moment,

706
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,004
but maybe not today.

707
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:28,140
Alice, that literally doesn't
fucking matter at all.

708
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,841
Where is Greg? Where is he?

709
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,411
- What?
- Where is Greg?

710
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:33,478
I...

711
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:35,147
He said he was going to bed.

712
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,881
So my guess would be
that he's sleeping.

713
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,259
Okay, don't you think
it's a little bit strange

714
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,152
that he hasn't, like,
woken up yet?

715
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,819
Jordan,

716
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,289
what are you trying to say.

717
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:45,890
Maybe we should
just go check on him.

718
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,159
No, no, no.

719
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,330
Jordan...

720
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:54,099
What are you doing?
Jordan... Jordan.

721
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:55,267
What are you doing!

722
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,601
- I'm staying safe.
- Really?

723
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:57,712
Because it looks like
you're grabbing

724
00:38:57,736 --> 00:39:00,005
a fucking meat cleaver
to go look for my boyfriend!

725
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,606
Wow. Boyfriend?

726
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,084
That's the first time
I've heard you call him that.

727
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,142
That's crazy.

728
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,320
Don't be such a bitch.

729
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,522
Alice, I'm literally
just protecting myself, okay?

730
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:10,315
Let me remind you,
our friend is dead.

731
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,627
So, if you could just, like,
not escalate the situation...

732
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:14,453
I'm not escalating.
You're holding the knife

733
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:15,997
and you're moving your hands
while you talk.

734
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,823
Alice, how long
have you known Greg?

735
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,958
Like...

736
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:24,329
long.

737
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:26,331
Alice.

738
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:28,333
Ugh...

739
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,603
I don't know exactly how long.

740
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,138
I... like...

741
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:35,140
two weeks.

742
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:36,308
Okay, uh...

743
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,908
What do you know
about Greg, Alice?

744
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:38,976
Oh, my God.

745
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,121
What do you know about him?

746
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:41,380
Oh, my God, guys!

747
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:42,490
Oh, my God!
Relax. Stop!

748
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:45,050
Stop! Stop! I know that
he's a good person, okay?

749
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,585
He's fundamentally
a good person.

750
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:48,153
He wouldn't do this. Like, no.

751
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:50,164
Do you know his middle name?
Do you know where he lives?

752
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,023
Do you know how much
fucking money he makes?

753
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,692
Do you know
his last name, Alice?

754
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,193
I know a lot.

755
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,562
Our first date was at...
was at a bar.

756
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:59,364
He drank, like,
a medium amount...

757
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:00,508
Okay, Alice... Stop.
He likes nature.

758
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:01,500
What is his middle name?

759
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:02,434
- He's a Libra moon.
- Where does he live?

760
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:03,511
You don't ask
what your middle name is!

761
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:06,438
- Okay? For a really long time.
- Oh... Fuck!

762
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:10,008
He's a Libra moon.
That says a lot!

763
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,209
Fuck!

764
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,581
Greg!
Shh!

765
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:18,226
What? You just said
we're looking for Greg!

766
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,327
Okay, well
don't fucking, Alice...

767
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:20,495
Greg! Can you come
into the kitchen?

768
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,586
We need you for a second.

769
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,655
Shut up.
Stop waving the knife at me!

770
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,023
Fuck.
You're making me...

771
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,558
Stop. Stop. Greg!

772
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,059
Stop. Just stop.
Just be quiet.

773
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,127
Stop. Stop.

774
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:30,995
Greg! Don't.
Relax.

775
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,465
Don't grab my mouth.
Relax. Relax. Relax.

776
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,167
You're silencing me.
Oh, my God.

777
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,967
Get the fuck off.
Okay, stop.

778
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:38,637
Don't grab me like that again.

779
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,504
And she came at me with a knife.

780
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:41,506
- I'm sorry...
- Back off.

781
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,641
Okay, buck!

782
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:45,243
Wait, where's Emma?

783
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:46,311
Oh, my God.

784
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:02,494
Emma?

785
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,065
Emma?

786
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:08,433
Guys,

787
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,268
maybe Emma could have done it.

788
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:11,412
She was really pissed at David.

789
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:12,513
Alice, what the fuck?

790
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:13,581
Emma wouldn't do that.

791
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:14,506
She was devastated.

792
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:16,541
She's having, like,
a full-on panic attack.

793
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:18,176
Yeah, but she's an actress.

794
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,111
She's acting.
Remember <i>Hedda Gabler?</i>

795
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,079
Okay, not to be mean,

796
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:23,114
but she wasn't that good
in <i>Hedda Gabler.</i>

797
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,666
This is my room.

798
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,068
So open it.

799
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,170
You open it.

800
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:47,272
What happened to,
"Greg would never do this?"

801
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:49,241
He wouldn't.
Okay, so open it.

802
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:50,675
I will in one second.

803
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:52,577
I'm going to.

804
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,489
He's not here.

805
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:09,127
Soph, are there any guns
in the house?

806
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,195
Guns?

807
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:11,897
No. No way.

808
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:14,332
David's dad can be a dick,
but his politics check out.

809
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:28,446
Guys...

810
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,587
What the fuck is this?

811
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,759
Uh... But...

812
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:44,129
He wanted to be prepared
for the hurricane. He...

813
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:48,809
Why did he circle
the fucking house

814
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,268
on his fucking map?

815
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:52,022
We have to
find Emma before he does.

816
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,305
Okay.

817
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,743
Let's check my room next.

818
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,679
I don't think
he's hiding in my bra.

819
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:38,583
Guys...

820
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:39,818
Come here.

821
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,735
Oh, my God, Emma.

822
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,171
Emma.

823
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:01,373
Are you okay?

824
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:03,217
What's going on?
What are you guys doing?

825
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,542
You scared me What's happening?

826
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:06,845
It's so hot in here.

827
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:09,881
What is that?

828
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:11,850
Xanax. Do you want one?
Yeah, give me one.

829
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:15,420
- You want one?
- No.

830
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:16,821
Hey, you take this.

831
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:19,357
- Why?
- I'm gonna find Greg.

832
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:21,760
Greg, why? Where's Max?

833
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:24,496
Maybe Max did it.
Maybe he is here.

834
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:25,797
Max was really angry at David.

835
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:26,874
I'm serious,
he looked like he was gonna

836
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:27,799
do something really fucked up.

837
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,467
Alice! Shut up.
I'm just saying.

838
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:30,769
Max would never.

839
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:32,470
Let's go find Greg.

840
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:33,872
Okay.

841
00:44:56,327 --> 00:44:57,429
What the...

842
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,700
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God.

843
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:05,537
What the hell is on his face?

844
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:08,373
It's his light therapy mask.
He has seasonal depression.

845
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:11,609
Let's go.

846
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:26,291
Hey... Shh...

847
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Greg.

848
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:50,648
- What's up?
- Where have you been?

849
00:45:50,682 --> 00:45:51,850
Huh?

850
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:52,951
Where have you been?

851
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:55,787
Oh, I, uh...

852
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,955
I couldn't sleep,

853
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:59,524
so I came down here
to do my exercises.

854
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:00,797
Why didn't you answer me?

855
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:01,993
Were you calling for me?

856
00:46:02,027 --> 00:46:03,394
Yeah.

857
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:05,430
I... I had my headphones in.

858
00:46:09,101 --> 00:46:12,370
Are you guys
still playing Werewolf?

859
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:18,443
Greg!

860
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:19,878
Stop! Stop it!

861
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,085
All right.

862
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:27,919
What am I supposed to do, huh?

863
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,487
Why don't you tell us,
fucking Greg?

864
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:31,756
Is that my go bag?
Is that a knife?

865
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,092
Why did you bring a go bag?

866
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:35,460
The hurricane?
See, I told you.

867
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:36,670
Why did you circle
the fucking house

868
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:37,762
on your fucking map?

869
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:41,066
What's going on?
David is dead.

870
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,634
His body is outside.

871
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:43,968
David's body. Wait, what?

872
00:46:44,003 --> 00:46:45,470
Why did you kill David?

873
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,106
You murdered my boyfriend.

874
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:50,942
No, no. David killed me.
Right?

875
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,777
This isn't a joke, Greg.

876
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:55,114
David is dead.
Somebody slit his throat.

877
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:56,948
- What?
- With a fucking sword,

878
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,616
you fucking sick fuck!

879
00:47:02,121 --> 00:47:03,988
Oh...

880
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:07,358
You guys are fucking with me?

881
00:47:10,595 --> 00:47:12,864
Oh, you guys
are fucking with me.

882
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:15,967
Fuck!

883
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:18,369
Cute.

884
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:19,804
No!

885
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:22,607
Okay.

886
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,080
Everyone needs
to take a deep breath.

887
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:25,910
Alice.

888
00:47:25,944 --> 00:47:27,022
Give me my knife back!

889
00:47:27,046 --> 00:47:28,880
What the fuck is going on?

890
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:31,050
I don't know!

891
00:47:31,083 --> 00:47:32,951
- Put down the weapons.
- You put it down.

892
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:34,419
Now!

893
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,121
On the floor!

894
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:39,067
Okay, okay.
How about this?

895
00:47:39,091 --> 00:47:40,434
- Put it down.
- Okay, okay, okay.

896
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:41,726
Okay, we'll put them down.

897
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:43,038
We'll put... We'll all
put them down.

898
00:47:43,062 --> 00:47:44,982
Right? We'll put them down
if you put yours down.

899
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:46,865
We'll put them down.

900
00:47:48,067 --> 00:47:50,169
Okay.

901
00:47:50,202 --> 00:47:52,104
Okay.
Yeah, please, please.

902
00:47:52,137 --> 00:47:53,705
- That seems fair.
- Yeah.

903
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:55,673
Okay.

904
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:56,808
Putting it down.

905
00:47:58,077 --> 00:47:59,677
We're good.
Yeah.

906
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,446
Okay, this is good.

907
00:48:02,114 --> 00:48:03,548
All right.

908
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:08,920
Jordan!
Are you okay?

909
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:10,521
- Ow!
- Stop! Stop!

910
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:12,857
- Please stop!
- Alice?

911
00:48:15,094 --> 00:48:16,494
Stop. Stop!

912
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:17,729
No! No!

913
00:48:26,105 --> 00:48:28,439
Sophie! No.
No, no, no, Sophie!

914
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,438
Mother fucker.

915
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,583
Oh, my God.

916
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:15,787
Oh, my God.

917
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:40,945
This isn't right.

918
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:44,649
He didn't do it.

919
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:47,618
Alice, how do you know?
How do you that know he did?

920
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:49,988
Look, I mean, like...

921
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,824
If you look at all of us, like,

922
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:55,560
on paper, logically,

923
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:58,063
he is the most likely
to commit an act of violence.

924
00:49:58,097 --> 00:49:59,630
On paper?

925
00:50:00,932 --> 00:50:03,768
What the fuck
are you even talking about?

926
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:04,635
I mean, he's the only one

927
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:06,637
who served in the military,
right? So...

928
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:08,840
What?

929
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:12,177
He's a vet.

930
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:13,911
Right? Like Iraq? Or...

931
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:15,646
No, I thought
it was Afghanistan.

932
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,217
He was a veterinarian.

933
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,019
He was
a veterinarian's assistant.

934
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:22,121
Are you fucking
serious right now?

935
00:50:22,154 --> 00:50:24,323
Then why did
you call him G.I. Joe?

936
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:27,192
Because... Have you seen him?

937
00:50:27,226 --> 00:50:29,194
Well, regardless, either way,

938
00:50:29,228 --> 00:50:33,165
like, out of all of us,
he is the biggest unknown.

939
00:50:33,198 --> 00:50:34,699
We've known each other forever.

940
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:37,136
Jordan, what are
you trying to do?

941
00:50:37,169 --> 00:50:39,047
I'm not...
I'm not trying to do anything.

942
00:50:39,071 --> 00:50:41,273
He's dead, okay?

943
00:50:41,306 --> 00:50:43,175
He's dead. We killed him.

944
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:44,675
She killed him.

945
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,821
Go change your shirt.

946
00:51:02,027 --> 00:51:05,197
We need to leave.
We need to get out of here.

947
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,597
We don't have a car.

948
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:08,333
Okay, I'm going to walk.
Emma, stop.

949
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:09,477
What do you mean?
You can't just fucking...

950
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:11,803
Emma, you're literally
in the middle of nowhere.

951
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:13,238
Where are you going?

952
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,618
I mean, it could
have been any of us.

953
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:29,887
We all scattered
when the lights went out.

954
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:32,890
I mean, it could
have been Max, okay?

955
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,959
Alice, you don't know
what you are talking about.

956
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:37,628
He punched David in
the face because of you.

957
00:51:37,662 --> 00:51:39,364
Just because Max
is in love with me

958
00:51:39,398 --> 00:51:41,033
doesn't mean
he would kill David.

959
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:43,935
Oh, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

960
00:51:44,436 --> 00:51:45,670
What?

961
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:48,806
This is not about you and Max.

962
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,309
Why are you being so mean?

963
00:51:50,342 --> 00:51:52,177
Because I'm upset, Emma.

964
00:51:52,211 --> 00:51:54,313
I'm upset because somebody
killed my best friend.

965
00:51:54,346 --> 00:51:56,848
Sophie, did you use?
I can believe you're making

966
00:51:56,881 --> 00:51:58,850
this about you.

967
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:02,354
I'm sad, too, okay?
I'm scared, too.

968
00:52:02,387 --> 00:52:04,689
I loved him so much.

969
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:06,191
It didn't seem like it.

970
00:52:06,225 --> 00:52:07,992
- What?
- It seemed like

971
00:52:08,026 --> 00:52:09,261
you loved having a boyfriend.

972
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:10,761
And you loved
feeling comfortable.

973
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:12,964
But, no, you did not love him.

974
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:14,665
You didn't even
fucking like him.

975
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:16,244
You were just too scared
to do anything about it.

976
00:52:16,268 --> 00:52:18,446
So you stayed for three years
longer than you should have

977
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,871
because you're a coward.

978
00:52:20,305 --> 00:52:21,739
No, I'm not.

979
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:24,109
No, I'm not.

980
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,345
I'm not.

981
00:52:27,012 --> 00:52:28,413
I'm not. Right? I...

982
00:52:29,414 --> 00:52:31,183
You're... You're so toxic.

983
00:52:31,216 --> 00:52:32,384
Emma, calm down.
You are.

984
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:33,818
No! No, I'm not gonna...

985
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:35,387
You are so toxic.

986
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,157
And, honestly, when you fell
off the face of the earth,

987
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,192
David was relieved.

988
00:52:40,225 --> 00:52:43,928
He was relieved he didn't
have to deal with you anymore.

989
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:45,739
I wish they had chopped off
your head instead,

990
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:46,964
you spineless piece of shit.

991
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:48,833
Sophie.

992
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:50,102
Jesus fucking Christ.

993
00:52:52,037 --> 00:52:53,238
Emma.

994
00:52:53,272 --> 00:52:55,140
Emma, come on. Wait.

995
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:56,974
- Wait.
- Emma.

996
00:52:57,009 --> 00:52:58,110
Emma.

997
00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:59,810
Emma.

998
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,247
That was real nice, Soph.

999
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:04,882
Guys...

1000
00:53:06,218 --> 00:53:07,352
Where the fuck is Bee?

1001
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:37,209
Emma.

1002
00:54:38,577 --> 00:54:39,877
I'm so sorry.

1003
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,280
I'm so sorry.

1004
00:54:41,313 --> 00:54:42,547
I'm really sorry.

1005
00:54:42,581 --> 00:54:44,849
I'm so fucked up right now.

1006
00:54:46,084 --> 00:54:47,152
I'm sorry.

1007
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:49,388
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1008
00:54:49,421 --> 00:54:51,341
Okay? It was just, like,
things started coming...

1009
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:59,197
Isn't that what you wanted?

1010
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:02,210
Yeah, Emma,
that's what I wanted.

1011
00:55:02,234 --> 00:55:03,311
That's what I was
in the mood for.

1012
00:55:03,335 --> 00:55:05,304
Thank you very much.
What the fuck?

1013
00:55:05,337 --> 00:55:06,971
Jesus Christ!

1014
00:55:07,005 --> 00:55:08,349
You always think everyone
is in love with you.

1015
00:55:08,373 --> 00:55:09,541
It's so crazy.
I...

1016
00:55:10,575 --> 00:55:12,144
I'm sorry.

1017
00:55:12,177 --> 00:55:13,245
I'm sorry.

1018
00:55:13,278 --> 00:55:14,346
Do you want this?

1019
00:55:16,448 --> 00:55:17,482
Yeah.

1020
00:55:17,516 --> 00:55:18,849
Thank you.

1021
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:19,984
Sure.

1022
00:55:33,565 --> 00:55:34,865
Bee?

1023
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:44,942
Soph?

1024
00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:09,967
Emma?

1025
00:57:20,038 --> 00:57:21,106
Help!

1026
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,441
Jordan!

1027
00:57:23,175 --> 00:57:24,042
Help!

1028
00:57:24,075 --> 00:57:26,044
- Help.
- Where are you?

1029
00:57:26,077 --> 00:57:27,546
Help! Please, help! Help!

1030
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:30,482
Help! Help! Help!

1031
00:57:32,117 --> 00:57:33,218
Emma.

1032
00:57:33,251 --> 00:57:34,395
- Oh, my God.
- Emma.

1033
00:57:34,419 --> 00:57:36,621
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1034
00:57:36,655 --> 00:57:38,323
What happened?
I don't know!

1035
00:57:38,356 --> 00:57:39,558
I don't know.

1036
00:57:42,194 --> 00:57:44,229
Don't touch her!
I'm just trying to...

1037
00:57:44,262 --> 00:57:45,673
Don't. No!
...figure out what happened.

1038
00:57:45,697 --> 00:57:47,308
How am I supposed
to know if I don't touch her?

1039
00:57:47,332 --> 00:57:48,999
Don't, just don't, just don't.

1040
00:57:49,501 --> 00:57:51,336
Oh, fuck.

1041
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:52,437
Oh, my God.

1042
00:57:54,272 --> 00:57:56,274
I heard something.

1043
00:57:56,308 --> 00:57:59,077
Um, maybe she...

1044
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:01,046
Oh, my God.

1045
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:03,048
- She fell, maybe she tripped?
- No.

1046
00:58:03,081 --> 00:58:05,250
No, no. She...

1047
00:58:05,283 --> 00:58:07,419
She... She got pushed, okay?

1048
00:58:07,452 --> 00:58:10,021
She was pushed.
I told you it wasn't Greg!

1049
00:58:10,055 --> 00:58:11,623
Are you happy that she's dead?

1050
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:14,226
No, but I told you
it wasn't Greg!

1051
00:58:22,501 --> 00:58:24,336
I did... I did tell you.

1052
00:58:30,709 --> 00:58:32,410
Don't you see what's happening?

1053
00:58:34,846 --> 00:58:36,448
What?

1054
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:37,649
Who was the killer?

1055
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:38,717
What?

1056
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:41,620
Who was the killer?

1057
00:58:42,254 --> 00:58:43,255
In the game?

1058
00:58:44,289 --> 00:58:46,324
It's following the same pattern.

1059
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:47,359
The deaths.

1060
00:58:47,392 --> 00:58:49,127
Please... Please,
just stop talking, please!

1061
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,296
David, Greg, Emma.

1062
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:52,831
David, Greg, Emma.

1063
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:54,299
No.
Yes!

1064
00:58:54,332 --> 00:58:55,572
- Fucking yes, Jordan!
- No.

1065
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,169
No, it's not
following the same pattern.

1066
00:58:58,203 --> 00:59:01,373
Greg died and then
we executed David.

1067
00:59:01,406 --> 00:59:03,775
But in real life,
David died and then we...

1068
00:59:03,808 --> 00:59:08,747
Okay, but Greg, David, Emma.
Greg, David, Emma.

1069
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,458
I mean, why else would
somebody leave her there

1070
00:59:10,482 --> 00:59:11,759
unless they wanted us
to find her?

1071
00:59:11,783 --> 00:59:13,318
Why would they want us
to find her?

1072
00:59:13,351 --> 00:59:16,354
Because they're playing
a sick fucking game.

1073
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:18,290
Okay?

1074
00:59:18,323 --> 00:59:20,258
Who was the killer?
I wasn't the killer.

1075
00:59:20,292 --> 00:59:21,259
Alice, you're fucking coked out.

1076
00:59:21,293 --> 00:59:23,662
You're coked out, okay?
We're all coked out.

1077
00:59:23,695 --> 00:59:25,263
I'm not.

1078
00:59:25,297 --> 00:59:26,498
I'm not.

1079
00:59:27,465 --> 00:59:28,600
Are you wearing make up?

1080
00:59:31,303 --> 00:59:32,804
I... I was upstairs,
changing my...

1081
00:59:32,837 --> 00:59:34,372
You look weird.

1082
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,741
Whose sweater is this?

1083
00:59:36,775 --> 00:59:38,109
I found it upstairs.

1084
00:59:39,377 --> 00:59:40,421
How long have you known her?

1085
00:59:40,445 --> 00:59:41,680
Stop, Alice.

1086
00:59:43,615 --> 00:59:44,616
Who are you?

1087
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,819
What?
You show up here,

1088
00:59:47,852 --> 00:59:49,854
start smiling at my boyfriend.

1089
00:59:51,723 --> 00:59:53,224
What are you talking about?

1090
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:54,326
Your voice is trembling.

1091
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:56,261
No. No.
Yeah. It is.

1092
00:59:56,294 --> 00:59:57,429
I googled you.

1093
00:59:57,462 --> 00:59:59,130
And there was nobody
with your name

1094
00:59:59,164 --> 01:00:02,267
who graduated
from Utah State this year.

1095
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,170
There's literally no record
of your attendance, at all.

1096
01:00:05,203 --> 01:00:06,271
What the fuck?

1097
01:00:06,905 --> 01:00:08,673
Listen, I can explain.

1098
01:00:08,707 --> 01:00:10,175
Oh, my God.

1099
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:11,710
You discovered David's body.

1100
01:00:11,743 --> 01:00:12,920
No, I just...
You could have tampered

1101
01:00:12,944 --> 01:00:13,845
with the generator,

1102
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:15,356
just like you tampered
with Sophie's car.

1103
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,314
You said you
left the lights on, right?

1104
01:00:16,348 --> 01:00:18,516
Are you serious?
We watched you kill someone.

1105
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:20,619
You literally murdered Greg!

1106
01:00:20,652 --> 01:00:21,886
Literally!

1107
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,755
Literally! You sick fuck!

1108
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:25,857
No, are you crazy? No.
Calm down.

1109
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:28,226
Let's just talk about it.
Talk about it?

1110
01:00:28,259 --> 01:00:29,661
Yeah.
No... No.

1111
01:00:29,694 --> 01:00:31,363
Let's just talk about it, okay?

1112
01:00:31,396 --> 01:00:32,530
Mmm-mmm. I don't want to.

1113
01:00:32,564 --> 01:00:34,299
- Sophie... Sophie.
- No!

1114
01:00:34,332 --> 01:00:35,776
Sophie.
ALI, CE: Do not touch her!

1115
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,535
Whoa!

1116
01:00:37,569 --> 01:00:38,679
You know what?
I don't...

1117
01:00:38,703 --> 01:00:39,738
I don't want you in here.

1118
01:00:39,771 --> 01:00:40,839
Okay, calm down.

1119
01:00:40,872 --> 01:00:41,906
No, seriously.
Alice!

1120
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,180
Alice!
I don't want you in here.

1121
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:45,176
I... Relax.
Just shut up! Shut up!

1122
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,511
I don't want you in here.

1123
01:00:46,544 --> 01:00:47,855
Get out of this room!
Let go of me, Alice.

1124
01:00:47,879 --> 01:00:48,956
Get the fuck out of this room!

1125
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,625
I don't want to look
at your face anymore. Get out.

1126
01:00:50,649 --> 01:00:51,726
- Alice, calm down.
- I'm not...

1127
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,227
- I'm not calming down.
- Let go of me, Alice.

1128
01:00:53,251 --> 01:00:55,320
No, you killed
my fucking boyfriend.

1129
01:00:55,353 --> 01:00:56,897
You know what? You know what?
It was self-defense.

1130
01:00:56,921 --> 01:00:57,965
I... I want her out.

1131
01:00:57,989 --> 01:00:59,491
Jordan, can you help me?
All right.

1132
01:00:59,524 --> 01:01:00,892
Jordan!
Jesus, Alice.

1133
01:01:00,925 --> 01:01:02,327
Get the fucking door!

1134
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,828
Jesus fucking Christ!

1135
01:01:03,862 --> 01:01:05,330
I do not want her in here!

1136
01:01:05,363 --> 01:01:06,464
- Relax!
- No!

1137
01:01:06,498 --> 01:01:08,400
- Relax!
- No!

1138
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:10,568
Sophie! Sophie, do something!

1139
01:01:10,602 --> 01:01:12,270
You killed him, get out!

1140
01:01:12,303 --> 01:01:13,672
- Sophie!
- Get out!

1141
01:01:17,909 --> 01:01:19,811
Sophie!

1142
01:03:41,853 --> 01:03:43,088
Stay here.

1143
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,590
I'm so hungry.

1144
01:05:25,623 --> 01:05:26,667
How can you be hungry right now?

1145
01:05:26,691 --> 01:05:27,835
I wasn't planning on this.

1146
01:05:27,859 --> 01:05:29,694
Alice...

1147
01:05:29,727 --> 01:05:32,064
What the fuck?
How the fuck you get in here?

1148
01:05:32,097 --> 01:05:33,698
She has a gun.

1149
01:05:33,731 --> 01:05:36,467
Jordan has a gun
in her pocket, Sophie,

1150
01:05:36,501 --> 01:05:37,702
get away from her.

1151
01:05:37,735 --> 01:05:38,913
No, no, Sophie,
she's confusing...

1152
01:05:38,937 --> 01:05:40,005
Let go of me.

1153
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:41,673
Are you kidding me?

1154
01:05:41,706 --> 01:05:43,008
I don't have a gun.

1155
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:44,909
Then empty your pockets.

1156
01:05:47,046 --> 01:05:48,047
Slowly!

1157
01:05:58,023 --> 01:05:59,490
That's it?

1158
01:05:59,524 --> 01:06:00,725
That's it.

1159
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,462
Oh, my God.

1160
01:06:05,763 --> 01:06:06,864
You are the killer.

1161
01:06:09,134 --> 01:06:10,969
In the... In the game... I...

1162
01:06:11,003 --> 01:06:12,537
How the fuck
did you get in here?

1163
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:14,182
Where is the gun?
I don't have a fucking gun.

1164
01:06:14,206 --> 01:06:17,142
We locked all the doors.
How did you get in?

1165
01:06:17,176 --> 01:06:18,210
You killed him.

1166
01:06:18,243 --> 01:06:20,778
Why would I kill David?
Why would I kill David?

1167
01:06:20,812 --> 01:06:21,679
Why would I kill Emma?

1168
01:06:21,713 --> 01:06:22,613
They are, literally,
my oldest friends.

1169
01:06:22,647 --> 01:06:24,782
You just fucking met them!
How dare you?

1170
01:06:24,816 --> 01:06:25,917
When I found David,

1171
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:28,519
you were the last person
to get there.

1172
01:06:29,587 --> 01:06:31,522
It took you awhile.
That's true.

1173
01:06:31,556 --> 01:06:33,958
Where were you
when Emma died, hmm?

1174
01:06:33,992 --> 01:06:35,593
You pushed her!
Shut up!

1175
01:06:35,626 --> 01:06:36,971
Guy's, don't listen to her.
You don't know what the fuck

1176
01:06:36,995 --> 01:06:38,696
you're talking about!
And then, I saw you.

1177
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:40,065
I saw you getting the gun.

1178
01:06:40,099 --> 01:06:41,166
That's a lie.

1179
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,534
That's a fucking lie.
You're lying. You're a liar!

1180
01:06:43,568 --> 01:06:45,237
You're lying through
your fucking teeth.

1181
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:46,105
You lied about everything.

1182
01:06:46,138 --> 01:06:47,672
You lied about
everything to Sophie.

1183
01:06:47,705 --> 01:06:49,274
You're a fucking liar.

1184
01:06:49,308 --> 01:06:51,576
Yeah, you...
You did lie to Sophie.

1185
01:06:56,181 --> 01:06:57,249
Okay.

1186
01:06:59,584 --> 01:07:00,618
Okay.

1187
01:07:04,822 --> 01:07:06,724
I did go to Utah State

1188
01:07:07,192 --> 01:07:09,161
for one semester.

1189
01:07:09,194 --> 01:07:13,232
But my mom was...
She was having a hard time

1190
01:07:13,265 --> 01:07:14,999
and I came home
to take care of her.

1191
01:07:17,802 --> 01:07:19,238
And I did work at Game Hut,

1192
01:07:20,905 --> 01:07:22,940
but they shut down
our location, like,

1193
01:07:22,974 --> 01:07:25,244
a week after I met you. I...
I've been applying, but...

1194
01:07:25,277 --> 01:07:26,611
What were you doing
when I dropped

1195
01:07:26,644 --> 01:07:27,779
you off at the mall?

1196
01:07:32,317 --> 01:07:34,886
Hung out at
the food court. I...

1197
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:39,957
didn't want to disappoint you.

1198
01:07:44,896 --> 01:07:46,065
I was embarrassed.

1199
01:07:50,701 --> 01:07:52,271
I should have told you.
I just...

1200
01:07:54,339 --> 01:07:56,075
My mom, she...

1201
01:07:58,143 --> 01:07:59,311
She has...

1202
01:08:01,913 --> 01:08:03,648
My mom has borderline.

1203
01:08:04,316 --> 01:08:05,883
Oh, my God.

1204
01:08:06,984 --> 01:08:09,054
I'm so sorry, that's...

1205
01:08:09,088 --> 01:08:10,355
That's really serious.

1206
01:08:10,389 --> 01:08:13,258
Mental health
is a really serious issue.

1207
01:08:13,292 --> 01:08:16,128
I mean, I've never actually
said this to anyone, but...

1208
01:08:18,996 --> 01:08:20,075
but I have body dysmorphia.

1209
01:08:20,099 --> 01:08:22,101
Oh, my God.
Shut the fuck up, Alice.

1210
01:08:24,436 --> 01:08:26,305
I wanted to tell you.
I just...

1211
01:08:29,941 --> 01:08:32,277
I just really wanted
you to like me.

1212
01:08:42,154 --> 01:08:44,889
You've got to
be fucking kidding me.

1213
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,194
Oh, my God.

1214
01:08:49,228 --> 01:08:50,129
Jordan, what the fuck?

1215
01:08:50,162 --> 01:08:51,439
Are you telling me
that you believe that

1216
01:08:51,463 --> 01:08:52,331
pile of bullshit?

1217
01:08:52,364 --> 01:08:54,066
Is that supposed
to inspire confidence?

1218
01:08:54,099 --> 01:08:55,800
Her mom has "borderline."

1219
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:58,303
Is that not a red fucking flag
to anybody else?

1220
01:08:58,337 --> 01:08:59,438
That's a serious issue.

1221
01:08:59,471 --> 01:09:00,905
Where the fuck did you get that?

1222
01:09:00,938 --> 01:09:01,973
David's Dad's rich!

1223
01:09:02,007 --> 01:09:02,940
Rich people
have fucking guns, Sophie!

1224
01:09:02,974 --> 01:09:04,742
My parents are rich.
They don't have guns.

1225
01:09:04,775 --> 01:09:06,245
Well, I mean, we're all rich,

1226
01:09:06,278 --> 01:09:08,413
but you and David
are like rich, rich.

1227
01:09:08,447 --> 01:09:10,382
That has never mattered to me...

1228
01:09:10,415 --> 01:09:12,117
Oh, shut the fuck up!

1229
01:09:12,151 --> 01:09:14,019
We didn't even
want to invite you.

1230
01:09:14,052 --> 01:09:15,354
We debated about inviting you,

1231
01:09:15,387 --> 01:09:17,089
but because it's David's house.

1232
01:09:17,122 --> 01:09:18,390
I didn't say that, but...

1233
01:09:18,423 --> 01:09:20,325
And, no, you did not
respond in the group chat.

1234
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:22,994
And then, you show up
with this fucking psychopath.

1235
01:09:23,028 --> 01:09:25,164
Don't call her a psychopath,
that's so ableist.

1236
01:09:25,197 --> 01:09:26,797
Fuck you.
You deserve each other.

1237
01:09:26,831 --> 01:09:28,799
I hope she fucking suffocates
you in your sleep.

1238
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:31,802
Yeah, you didn't
reply in the chat.

1239
01:09:31,836 --> 01:09:34,439
And David actually told me

1240
01:09:34,473 --> 01:09:38,143
that you, like, begged him
to talk to your parents

1241
01:09:38,177 --> 01:09:40,945
and, like,
unlock your trust again.

1242
01:09:40,978 --> 01:09:42,357
And that's why
you're actually here.

1243
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:43,714
Oh, yeah?

1244
01:09:43,748 --> 01:09:44,825
Oh, yeah, did he tell you that

1245
01:09:44,849 --> 01:09:46,227
while you guys were railing
lines in front of me.

1246
01:09:46,251 --> 01:09:47,085
Your addict friend

1247
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:49,221
who you're supposedly
so worried about?

1248
01:09:49,254 --> 01:09:50,755
- We are worried.
- No!

1249
01:09:50,788 --> 01:09:52,167
No, no, no.
Let me get this straight.

1250
01:09:52,191 --> 01:09:53,301
Okay, let me get this straight.

1251
01:09:53,325 --> 01:09:54,759
So, when the black girl

1252
01:09:54,792 --> 01:09:56,328
has a coke habit,
it's a problem.

1253
01:09:56,361 --> 01:09:58,030
But when everyone else
around her does it,

1254
01:09:58,063 --> 01:10:00,098
including her best friend,
who happens to be white

1255
01:10:00,532 --> 01:10:01,799
and male,

1256
01:10:01,832 --> 01:10:03,068
it's fine?

1257
01:10:03,101 --> 01:10:06,138
I understand and I'm an ally,

1258
01:10:06,171 --> 01:10:10,142
and I totally get how it...

1259
01:10:11,943 --> 01:10:13,078
looks that way.

1260
01:10:14,146 --> 01:10:15,214
And...

1261
01:10:16,281 --> 01:10:17,382
Um...

1262
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,185
Jordan?
Oh, my God.

1263
01:10:20,219 --> 01:10:22,753
You are obsessed
with playing the victim.

1264
01:10:22,787 --> 01:10:23,689
Excuse me?

1265
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:25,357
I had to ride
in the ambulance with you

1266
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:27,392
three times,
thinking you were dead.

1267
01:10:27,426 --> 01:10:29,261
I needed help and I got it

1268
01:10:29,294 --> 01:10:30,429
and I'm sorry.
You got help?

1269
01:10:30,462 --> 01:10:33,898
You mean we had to narc
on you to your fucking dad

1270
01:10:33,931 --> 01:10:36,301
so he'd cut you off
and ship you off to rehab,

1271
01:10:36,335 --> 01:10:39,770
while you were quite
literally kicking and screaming.

1272
01:10:39,804 --> 01:10:41,039
Yeah.
And then you just

1273
01:10:41,073 --> 01:10:42,507
fell off the face of the earth.

1274
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:43,651
'Cause that's what you do, Soph.

1275
01:10:43,675 --> 01:10:45,420
That's what you do when
things get tough, you run.

1276
01:10:45,444 --> 01:10:47,845
You ran away to go write
your fucking memoirs.

1277
01:10:47,878 --> 01:10:49,880
It's creative non-fiction
which is a valid response

1278
01:10:49,914 --> 01:10:51,383
to life in an attention economy.

1279
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:53,051
Oh, fuck off and die.

1280
01:10:53,085 --> 01:10:54,186
You write little essays

1281
01:10:54,219 --> 01:10:56,488
about your mommy and her vodka.

1282
01:10:56,521 --> 01:10:57,989
And your pussy
and your feelings.

1283
01:10:58,023 --> 01:10:59,258
And your fucking feelings.

1284
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:01,059
Oh, my God, we are all drowning

1285
01:11:01,093 --> 01:11:02,461
in your fucking feelings.

1286
01:11:02,494 --> 01:11:05,497
Feelings are facts.
No! No, they're not.

1287
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:06,797
Facts are facts.

1288
01:11:06,831 --> 01:11:08,200
Why did you ghost us, Sophie?

1289
01:11:08,233 --> 01:11:09,368
Like why?

1290
01:11:10,369 --> 01:11:11,836
Because you fucking trigger me.

1291
01:11:13,904 --> 01:11:15,040
You enable me.

1292
01:11:16,475 --> 01:11:17,509
Does she know?

1293
01:11:17,542 --> 01:11:18,943
Does she know what?

1294
01:11:19,578 --> 01:11:21,979
That you begged me

1295
01:11:22,014 --> 01:11:24,449
to stop at your apartment
on my way up here.

1296
01:11:24,483 --> 01:11:25,816
And I did.

1297
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:28,086
And we fucked in your car.

1298
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:30,088
She's fucking lying.

1299
01:11:30,122 --> 01:11:31,399
She's lying through
her fucking teeth.

1300
01:11:31,423 --> 01:11:32,467
She's trying to get
in your head.

1301
01:11:32,491 --> 01:11:34,192
Don't listen to her, okay?

1302
01:11:34,226 --> 01:11:35,327
Check her texts.

1303
01:11:37,995 --> 01:11:40,032
You are unhinged, Jordan.

1304
01:11:41,366 --> 01:11:44,169
You are devoid of empathy.

1305
01:11:44,202 --> 01:11:45,504
You have no feelings.

1306
01:11:45,537 --> 01:11:47,306
Do you want to know
why I could never

1307
01:11:47,339 --> 01:11:48,806
ever be with you?

1308
01:11:49,874 --> 01:11:50,975
Because you schedule

1309
01:11:51,009 --> 01:11:53,011
everything in your
fucking Google calendar,

1310
01:11:53,045 --> 01:11:54,246
including sex.

1311
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:56,381
Because you have no soul.

1312
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,482
Fuck you.

1313
01:11:57,516 --> 01:11:59,384
You're emotionally abusive.

1314
01:11:59,418 --> 01:12:00,918
I had to go to therapy for PTSD.

1315
01:12:00,951 --> 01:12:02,853
You can fucking ask Alice.

1316
01:12:02,887 --> 01:12:04,589
Yeah, she did.

1317
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:06,591
For a long time.

1318
01:12:11,996 --> 01:12:13,864
You hate Alice.

1319
01:12:13,898 --> 01:12:15,534
No, I don't.
Yeah, you despise her.

1320
01:12:15,567 --> 01:12:17,045
You complain constantly
about how vapid

1321
01:12:17,069 --> 01:12:18,437
and annoying she is.
You hate her.

1322
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:20,305
It's pitiful how
you won't stop making fun

1323
01:12:20,339 --> 01:12:22,407
of her stupid little podcast.

1324
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:23,974
Let her have the podcast.

1325
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:26,877
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1326
01:12:26,911 --> 01:12:30,148
You hate listen to her podcast.

1327
01:12:30,182 --> 01:12:31,183
Wait...

1328
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:32,883
What?

1329
01:12:33,951 --> 01:12:35,454
And you made us
swear on our lives

1330
01:12:35,487 --> 01:12:36,588
not to tell anyone.

1331
01:12:37,356 --> 01:12:38,523
Jordan, is that true?

1332
01:12:39,924 --> 01:12:42,027
I like your podcast, Alice.

1333
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,929
What is your podcast about?

1334
01:12:44,962 --> 01:12:46,964
Hanging out with your
smartest and funniest friend.

1335
01:12:46,997 --> 01:12:50,469
Did you just groan?

1336
01:12:50,502 --> 01:12:51,536
No.

1337
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:52,504
When I said "Hanging out

1338
01:12:52,537 --> 01:12:54,506
"with your smartest
and funniest friend."

1339
01:12:54,539 --> 01:12:57,008
Oh, my God.
Like that. Like that!

1340
01:12:57,042 --> 01:12:58,210
Fuck!
You just did it again.

1341
01:12:58,243 --> 01:12:59,544
No, I didn't!
First of all,

1342
01:12:59,578 --> 01:13:02,247
a podcast takes
a lot of work, okay?

1343
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,582
You have to organize the guests.

1344
01:13:03,615 --> 01:13:05,384
You have to do a Google calendar

1345
01:13:05,417 --> 01:13:07,619
and you build a following.

1346
01:13:07,652 --> 01:13:09,388
It takes a long fucking time!

1347
01:13:09,421 --> 01:13:11,223
And I've been working
on it for a while!

1348
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:13,258
Okay?

1349
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:15,260
And then, let me say,

1350
01:13:15,293 --> 01:13:18,263
that nobody likes you, okay?

1351
01:13:18,296 --> 01:13:21,566
Nobody likes you!
Nobody likes you!

1352
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,311
Do you know when you're
drunk and you cry to me,

1353
01:13:23,335 --> 01:13:25,003
"Oh, I'm afraid nobody likes me

1354
01:13:25,036 --> 01:13:26,647
"because I'm mean
and a bitch and I suck."

1355
01:13:26,671 --> 01:13:30,041
Well, you do, okay?
You fucking suck.

1356
01:13:30,075 --> 01:13:32,210
And I only hang out
with you out of pity

1357
01:13:32,244 --> 01:13:35,080
and the suffocating weight
of our shared history.

1358
01:13:35,113 --> 01:13:37,349
And that is all.

1359
01:13:37,382 --> 01:13:39,984
And you're just so in love

1360
01:13:40,018 --> 01:13:42,154
with your rags
to riches narrative,

1361
01:13:42,187 --> 01:13:44,089
like you're the only
fucking person in the world

1362
01:13:44,122 --> 01:13:45,657
who didn't come from money.

1363
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:47,659
You know what?

1364
01:13:47,692 --> 01:13:51,696
Your parents
are upper middle class.

1365
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:54,299
No, they're not.

1366
01:13:54,699 --> 01:13:55,933
Jordan.

1367
01:13:56,668 --> 01:13:58,503
They are.

1368
01:13:58,537 --> 01:14:00,605
They teach at a university.

1369
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,009
It's public.

1370
01:14:04,042 --> 01:14:06,144
Oh, my God.

1371
01:14:06,178 --> 01:14:09,147
Oh, my God, I mean,
no wonder Sophie OD'd.

1372
01:14:09,181 --> 01:14:10,649
Who could date
a fucking spreadsheet

1373
01:14:10,682 --> 01:14:12,083
with a superiority complex?

1374
01:14:12,117 --> 01:14:13,597
It's, like, you're such a...

1375
01:14:14,419 --> 01:14:16,488
Ow!

1376
01:14:17,422 --> 01:14:19,157
What the fuck?

1377
01:14:19,191 --> 01:14:20,492
What the fuck, Jordan?

1378
01:14:20,525 --> 01:14:23,528
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

1379
01:14:23,562 --> 01:14:25,197
Did you just fucking shoot me?

1380
01:14:27,332 --> 01:14:29,668
- No.
- You fucking shot me.

1381
01:14:29,701 --> 01:14:31,436
With a gun!

1382
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:32,437
No,
I didn't shoot you. I...

1383
01:14:32,471 --> 01:14:34,639
You fucking
murdered them, you freak!

1384
01:14:34,673 --> 01:14:37,108
You're the murderer.
I knew it!

1385
01:14:37,142 --> 01:14:38,677
I knew it, you're such a bitch!

1386
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:39,644
You're such a fucking bitch!

1387
01:14:39,678 --> 01:14:41,646
- I didn't murder anybody.
- Yes, you did.

1388
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,248
Jordan, put the gun down.

1389
01:14:43,281 --> 01:14:45,283
I've never been shot before.

1390
01:14:45,317 --> 01:14:48,353
It really fucking hurts!

1391
01:14:48,386 --> 01:14:50,088
Put the fucking
gun down, please.

1392
01:14:50,121 --> 01:14:52,090
You did this.
You made me do this.

1393
01:14:52,123 --> 01:14:53,358
Why did you make me do that?

1394
01:14:53,391 --> 01:14:54,469
What are you doing?
Put the gun down.

1395
01:14:54,493 --> 01:14:56,628
Why? Why did you shoot me?

1396
01:14:56,661 --> 01:14:57,629
I did not shoot you.

1397
01:14:57,662 --> 01:14:59,531
Yes, you did! With that gun!
Stop, stop, stop.

1398
01:14:59,564 --> 01:15:01,199
Alice, stop. Stop!
With that gun.

1399
01:15:01,233 --> 01:15:03,168
Stop waving it around.
I'm not waving.

1400
01:15:03,201 --> 01:15:04,536
Don't hit me.
You already shot me.

1401
01:15:04,569 --> 01:15:06,371
Stop! Don't touch me.

1402
01:15:06,404 --> 01:15:07,748
- No, no, no!
- Get the gun!

1403
01:15:07,772 --> 01:15:09,574
- No!
- Sophie, the gun!

1404
01:15:09,608 --> 01:15:11,142
Don't! Stop!
You're on my leg!

1405
01:15:11,176 --> 01:15:12,310
You're on my leg!

1406
01:15:13,078 --> 01:15:14,446
I want it. Give it to me!

1407
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:16,648
- No!
- Let go!

1408
01:15:21,152 --> 01:15:22,254
No!

1409
01:15:22,287 --> 01:15:23,622
Ow!

1410
01:15:23,655 --> 01:15:25,123
No!

1411
01:15:25,156 --> 01:15:26,057
- No!
- Give it to me.

1412
01:15:26,091 --> 01:15:27,435
Give me it! Give me it!
Get off of me! No!

1413
01:15:27,459 --> 01:15:28,569
Get the fuck off me!

1414
01:15:28,593 --> 01:15:29,794
Get off!

1415
01:15:32,397 --> 01:15:34,366
Ow! My fucking leg!

1416
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:36,067
Where is it?

1417
01:15:36,101 --> 01:15:37,669
Ow!

1418
01:16:19,144 --> 01:16:20,345
I didn't do it.

1419
01:16:32,457 --> 01:16:33,758
Please, don't move.

1420
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:35,160
Don't you fucking move.

1421
01:16:35,193 --> 01:16:36,561
It's okay...
It's okay, Jordan.

1422
01:16:36,595 --> 01:16:38,430
Please, don't do it.

1423
01:16:38,463 --> 01:16:39,898
Please, just...

1424
01:16:39,931 --> 01:16:43,435
Stop! I didn't do it.
Please, just stop, okay?

1425
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:45,236
Just put it down.
Please, stop moving.

1426
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:47,772
Please... please,
don't follow me, please.

1427
01:16:47,806 --> 01:16:50,675
Please...
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

1428
01:16:50,709 --> 01:16:52,243
Stop, stop, stop!

1429
01:16:52,277 --> 01:16:53,545
Why are we doing this?

1430
01:16:53,578 --> 01:16:54,913
Don't come up here.

1431
01:16:54,946 --> 01:16:56,181
Don't, please, don't.

1432
01:16:56,214 --> 01:16:57,291
Please put it down.

1433
01:16:57,315 --> 01:16:59,250
Please stop.
Please stay there.

1434
01:16:59,284 --> 01:17:00,318
Oh, my God.

1435
01:17:00,352 --> 01:17:01,553
Please...

1436
01:17:03,822 --> 01:17:05,690
- Stop.
- I'm begging you...

1437
01:17:05,724 --> 01:17:07,892
Don't fucking come up here.
Please.

1438
01:17:07,926 --> 01:17:10,428
Sophie, I'm serious,
just stay there.

1439
01:17:11,596 --> 01:17:12,664
Stop.

1440
01:17:12,697 --> 01:17:14,566
Just stay there.
Just please stay there.

1441
01:17:14,599 --> 01:17:15,500
I'm begging you.

1442
01:17:15,533 --> 01:17:19,638
Please, fucking...
Fucking stay there! Fuck!

1443
01:17:38,723 --> 01:17:39,724
Bee!

1444
01:18:13,758 --> 01:18:17,462
Check her texts.

1445
01:19:06,644 --> 01:19:07,946
Sophie.

1446
01:19:12,984 --> 01:19:14,452
Did you kill Emma?

1447
01:19:14,753 --> 01:19:15,787
No.

1448
01:19:19,324 --> 01:19:20,492
Did you?

1449
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:21,960
No.

1450
01:19:24,429 --> 01:19:27,465
It's okay, if you did it.
It's okay.

1451
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:31,803
I just want to know.
You can tell me.

1452
01:19:31,836 --> 01:19:34,305
Did you kill David?
What?

1453
01:19:34,339 --> 01:19:35,607
No.

1454
01:19:36,008 --> 01:19:37,308
You killed Greg.

1455
01:19:37,342 --> 01:19:39,044
To protect you.

1456
01:19:39,078 --> 01:19:40,578
I had to.

1457
01:19:59,531 --> 01:20:00,932
Will you answer this honestly?

1458
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,302
Okay, I promise. What is it?

1459
01:20:04,803 --> 01:20:05,970
Did you...

1460
01:20:06,704 --> 01:20:07,806
With Jordan?

1461
01:20:08,573 --> 01:20:09,707
No.

1462
01:20:09,974 --> 01:20:11,376
No.

1463
01:20:12,677 --> 01:20:15,713
No, I didn't...
I didn't. I would never.

1464
01:20:18,117 --> 01:20:19,484
I love you, okay?

1465
01:20:26,391 --> 01:20:27,525
Do you love me?

1466
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,635
I just wanted to touch you.

1467
01:20:38,703 --> 01:20:39,737
You frighten me.

1468
01:20:47,946 --> 01:20:49,048
Bee!

1469
01:20:53,518 --> 01:20:54,719
Bee!

1470
01:20:56,855 --> 01:20:58,623
We have to stay together!

1471
01:20:59,624 --> 01:21:01,392
Bee!

1472
01:21:06,431 --> 01:21:07,498
Bee!

1473
01:21:14,606 --> 01:21:15,640
Bee?

1474
01:21:18,943 --> 01:21:20,112
Bee?

1475
01:21:22,181 --> 01:21:23,681
Where are you?

1476
01:21:26,918 --> 01:21:28,153
I love you.

1477
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:33,892
We have to stay together.

1478
01:21:39,731 --> 01:21:40,965
Bee!

1479
01:21:46,905 --> 01:21:48,473
- Okay.
- Bee!

1480
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1481
01:23:52,597 --> 01:23:53,731
Hey, hey.

1482
01:23:55,933 --> 01:23:58,703
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1483
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:02,974
I have to tell you something.

1484
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:07,279
I went to Alice's room and I...

1485
01:24:07,312 --> 01:24:10,015
And then I found coke
and then...

1486
01:24:10,049 --> 01:24:13,751
I... I said all these things
to Emma and she...

1487
01:24:13,785 --> 01:24:15,820
I... I gave her pills
'cause...

1488
01:24:16,854 --> 01:24:18,656
And then she tripped and fell.

1489
01:24:21,026 --> 01:24:22,161
It's my fault.

1490
01:24:23,328 --> 01:24:26,165
Sophie, it's okay. It's okay.

1491
01:24:28,367 --> 01:24:30,235
I thought no one
would believe me.

1492
01:24:37,342 --> 01:24:38,643
Give me your phone.

1493
01:24:40,845 --> 01:24:41,879
What?

1494
01:24:41,913 --> 01:24:44,016
I want to see
your text with Jordan.

1495
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:46,851
No.

1496
01:24:46,884 --> 01:24:48,120
I have to see your texts.

1497
01:24:50,822 --> 01:24:51,856
Please?

1498
01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:20,018
No.
Sophie.

1499
01:25:20,052 --> 01:25:21,286
Stop!

1500
01:26:04,129 --> 01:26:05,397
That's not my phone.

1501
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:06,931
Oh... What?

1502
01:26:12,404 --> 01:26:13,838
That's not my phone.

1503
01:28:04,483 --> 01:28:05,517
What happened?

1504
01:28:36,448 --> 01:28:37,948
I have reception.
