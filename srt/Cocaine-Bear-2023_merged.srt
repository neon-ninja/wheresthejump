You know
the first thing I thought

20
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,848
when I saw you?

21
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,853
I thought, "I want to make
a child with that person."

22
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,231
What if it's a her?

23
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,360
What would you call her?

24
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,487
Ragni, maybe.

25
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,072
Sorry?

26
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,698
Ragni.

27
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,993
Uh, let me think about
that for a second.

28
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,329
- Ragni.
- You hate it.

29
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,040
- Uh, boy's name?
- Texas.

30
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,292
You kidding me?

31
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,796
Texas is, like, a state,
you know? -I know.

32
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,839
There's about
three or four hours

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,174
till we reach the peak.

34
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,052
Ah, great.

35
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,018
Sweetie, can I just say
one last thing?

36
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,562
Then, I swear,
no more wedding talk.

37
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,023
- Of course.
- It's about the band.

38
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,609
But that is the one thing
you said I could handle myself,

39
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,195
and I've already made
my decision, Elsa.

40
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,239
Yeah, it's just that
I don't want

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,199
to use your brother's band.

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,784
- Why not?
- Honey...

43
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,244
He's super, super good.

44
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,204
- He works super hard.
- Yeah.

45
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,956
And-and he-he even takes
vocal lessons now.

46
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,541
Yeah, I know this.

47
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,335
I know this. It's just that,
um, well, Eric is no good.

48
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,005
I mean, he's, well,
terrible, actually.

49
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,467
His singing is like shit.

50
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,681
Hey. I mean, he has a nice b...

51
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,392
Olaf!

52
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,185
Olaf, I didn't mean to...
Oh, god.

53
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,770
Wait for me.

54
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,731
Why are you so sensitive?

55
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,239
Told you I could get us here.

56
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,038
It's beautiful.

57
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,999
Thank you. I love you.

58
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,679
Elsa.

59
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,725
- Look. Look.
- What is it? Hmm? Hmm?

60
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,102
- Look.

61
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,856
Quick, the camera.
Get the camera.

62
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,859
Oh, my, I've always wanted
to see a bear in real life.

63
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,528
First, humpbacks in Iceland,
and now this.

64
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,032
We have such good luck
in nature.

65
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,126
What do you see?

66
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,961
Hmm?

67
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,631
It's demented or something.

68
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,966
What?

69
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,179
Can I get the camera?
Give me the camera. -Yeah.

70
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,223
Demented?

71
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,766
I-I-I think we should leave it.

72
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,809
It's-it's something wrong
with it. Come on.

73
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,186
- Come on...
Ah!

74
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,648
Shh. Come on.
It's so cute.

75
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,150
Oh, there's nothing
to be afraid of, kristoffer.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm not afraid, Elsa.
Oh, sweetie, now, of course not.

77
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,328
Oh, fuck.

78
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,830
Don't panic.

79
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,998
What do we do?

80
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,542
"If it's black, fight back.

81
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,544
If it's brown, lay down."

82
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,212
But is it black or is it brown?

83
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,547
I mean, it looks brown to me.

84
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,340
We're in appalachia.
It's black.

85
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,050
- We have to fight it.
- How do you know?

86
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,095
You're not a bear expert.

87
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,721
Whatever you do, don't...

88
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,807
- Run! Where are we going?
- Oh-oh, no. Oh-oh, no.

89
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,728
- I said don't run! Stop! Stop!
- Uphill. Uphill.

90
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,187
Run!
- Where do we go?

91
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,565
- Run, Elsa! Run!
- Where do we go?

92
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,692
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

93
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,902
- Run!

94
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,696
He's coming! Come on!

95
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,407
No! It's following...

96
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,831
Olaf! No!

97
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,083
God!

98
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,760
Help me!
- Come on! Come on!

99
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,722
Olaf!

100
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,289
This is drugs.

101
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,666
This is your brain on drugs.

102
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:02,338
It isn't glamorous
or cool or kid stuff.

103
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,590
The thrill can kill.

104
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:09,596
Smoking crack is like
putting a gun in your mouth...

105
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,808
And pulling the trigger.

106
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,855
Millions of dollars' worth of
cocaine dropped from the sky

107
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,941
early today onto a driveway
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

108
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,943
Kenley Jones reports tonight
it was found

109
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,446
on the body of a man
who fell to his death

110
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,449
when his parachute
failed to open.

111
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,036
The body of the heavily
armed parachutist was found

112
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,789
early this morning
by 85-year-old Fred Myers

113
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,791
and his neighbor, Ralph Johnson.

114
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,793
And you could see that
his main chute didn't open,

115
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,878
so I guess the loafers
was too much for him.

116
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,714
Police found more than
70 pounds of cocaine

117
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,800
wrapped in
football-size packages

118
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,845
in a duffel bag
the chutist was carrying.

119
00:07:56,101 --> 00:08:00,271
Emergency chute deployed,
but didn't help much, I suppose.

120
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,315
Any narcotics found
with the plane wreckage?

121
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,983
Nothing.

122
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,111
Here's the I.D.

123
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,862
I know who that is.

124
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,408
Full name:
Andrew c. Thornton ii.

125
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,661
Man was out of his mind.

126
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,581
- What's the "c" stand for?
- Hmm?

127
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,836
You said "full name," but
you didn't say his full name.

128
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,841
Thornton was one of Syd
white's guys out of Missouri.

129
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,885
He's a known drug trafficker
with ties to Colombia.

130
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,847
Part of
the bluegrass conspiracy.

131
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:39,017
And there's more of this
out there.

132
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,062
They dumped it somewhere.

133
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,190
Hey, reba,
you have a dog, right?

134
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,025
Had.

135
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,737
Border collie. Barry.

136
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,156
Sorry for your loss.

137
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,158
Border collie, huh?

138
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,243
That's a cool dog.

139
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,578
Did he play fetch and stuff?

140
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,955
He loved fetch.

141
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,207
What?

142
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,168
Nothing. I just...

143
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,088
That's just awesome.

144
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,566
Damn it, Gabe.

145
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,319
Hi, daveed.

146
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,072
Uh, mind if I order first?

147
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,075
This won't take long.

148
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,334
Damn, I just bought these.

149
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,508
Hey, how's Gabe doing, anyway?

150
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,886
Did you hear about Thornton?

151
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,762
It's a tough way to go.

152
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,972
He only had 30 kilos on him.

153
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,934
Any idea where
we could find the rest?

154
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,435
Chattahoochee.

155
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,728
Georgia?

156
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,563
There's an area
called blood mountain.

157
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,440
When the plane's going down,

158
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,442
the pilots know
where to drop our load.

159
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,027
And then we just go and get it.

160
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,447
I don't need a bunch
of worried Colombians.

161
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,282
Now, I want you
to take Eddie with you.

162
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,659
Eddie's in mourning.

163
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,494
Joanie just died.

164
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,787
And he quit.

165
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,705
Joanie's the reason why he quit.

166
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,457
She's not here anymore.

167
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,626
The sooner he moves on,
the better.

168
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,837
Syd, I-I just don't...

169
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,046
Stop.

170
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,924
He won't even come
to get his goddamn son.

171
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:37,302
I am sick and tired
of watching my kid's kid.

172
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,722
Grandpa Syd, watch.

173
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,017
Yeah, that's great.

174
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,772
Got to go. Shift starts at 8:00.

175
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,442
Tomorrow's lunch is in
the fridge, and the chicken's...

176
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,028
Chicken's in the microwave.

177
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,906
Just hit "start."

178
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,825
Thought you were off tonight.

179
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,577
We talked about this, remember?

180
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,120
Me picking up some extra shifts?

181
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,663
You said you were okay with it.

182
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,373
I was okay with it
until I realized

183
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,333
why you want
those extra shifts...

184
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,672
So you could go and do overtime
with ray the pediatrician.

185
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,676
Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.

186
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,512
You know, he invited us
to go to Nashville

187
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,097
this weekend
to see his band play.

188
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,933
We were supposed to go paint
the waterfall this weekend.

189
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,810
I know, but it's gonna be fun.

190
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,353
We're gonna make
a whole weekend out of it.

191
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,272
It's Nashville.

192
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,984
He's a good guy, deirdra.

193
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,402
Just...

194
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,778
Give him a chance.

195
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,947
Please don't do that.

196
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,283
Do what?

197
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,036
You know what.

198
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,081
We'll paint the waterfall
another weekend, okay?

199
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,878
Close my door.

200
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,386
That's enough for today.

201
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,473
Wait, what?

202
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,476
Hey, Eddie.

203
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,855
They spelled her name wrong, daveed.

204
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,232
- It says "John."
- Oh.

205
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,568
- Says "John."
- Yeah.

206
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,737
- Her name is fucking Joan.
- Look, we...

207
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,906
- We could get it fixed.
- No.

208
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,908
I got to wait a week
for it to heal first.

209
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,077
I got seven more days of "John."

210
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,079
The chutist has been identified

211
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,872
as Andrew Thornton
of Paris, Kentucky.

212
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,208
- Wait, is that us?
- Hey.

213
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:35,045
Listen, Syd is worried
about you, all right?

214
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,632
Says you haven't seen Gabe
in weeks.

215
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,260
I'm so sad, man.

216
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,972
I'm so fucking sad.

217
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,808
Okay?

218
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,483
Can I get the, uh...
The penne, please?

219
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,277
Does it come with chicken,
or is it just, uh...

220
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,280
It's just plain.

221
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,543
I knew you'd be late.

222
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,753
It finally came in.
Check it out.

223
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,630
How many weeks' allowance
is that?

224
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,674
Like a thousand, but worth it.

225
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,509
- Can I use the toilet?
- Uh, no.

226
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,594
My mom is gonna be home soon.

227
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:28,765
And we got to go if we want
to get to the falls by lunch.

228
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,726
Why by lunch?

229
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,395
The light, Henry.

230
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,522
But I got to go pee.

231
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,940
Go outside.

232
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,817
Why do I skip school with you?

233
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,361
You're bossier than
the teachers.

234
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,946
Now, the adoption people...

235
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,115
I'm not sure who I talked to
over there...

236
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,325
Told me I was supposed to be
getting me a lab.

237
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,121
A fun one, a...
A man's-best-friend type.

238
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,831
I don't know
if there was an error,

239
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,667
because the one I got
is just kind of...

240
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,502
Bob?
- I don't know,

241
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,004
just kind of fancy.

242
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,715
Bob, captain says
it's time to go. -Got it.

243
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,218
Hey, look, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

244
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,095
Hey, reba.

245
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,348
You got plans for tonight?

246
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,976
Uh, Bob, you're a nice guy.

247
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,772
- I just don't...
- Mind looking after rosette?

248
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,690
- Oh.
- I have to go to Georgia

249
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,941
for the Thornton case,

250
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,651
and you said
you were good at dogs.

251
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,403
I said I had a dog.

252
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,198
You don't have jurisdiction
in Georgia.

253
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,908
A trucker overheard
a couple of guys

254
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,367
talking at a bar last night.

255
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,245
- I'll tell you in the car.
- No, no, no.

256
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,039
Pretty sure they're Syd's guys.

257
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh, come on. You got to be
sort of good with them.

258
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,252
I only had her for a day.

259
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,796
Please?

260
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,382
Uh, I don't know if I could
trust anyone else around here.

261
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,219
Just go.

262
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,930
We'll be fine.

263
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,224
Thanks.

264
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,227
Can't believe
I left the backpack.

265
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,104
I can. I know the way.

266
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,939
School's gonna call, you know.

267
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,941
You know what? Let 'em.

268
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,401
And your mom's gonna be pissed.

269
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,945
So's your dad.

270
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,738
He doesn't care if I play hooky.

271
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,323
For a girl who likes
to be left alone,

272
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,075
you do a lot of shit
for attention.

273
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,743
Look, I'm not
ditching for attention.

274
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,078
I just want to paint
the waterfall.

275
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,412
Admit it.

276
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,415
You want her to find out
and worry about you.

277
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Jesus! Fuck!

278
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,199
Coral, it's sari.

279
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,826
Is Dee Dee over there?

280
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,786
School just called.

281
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,121
No.

282
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,457
Yeah, well, can you just
put Elliot on?

283
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,376
Yes, well, his daughter
just ditched school,

284
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,255
so can you please
just put him on?

285
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,300
Every time I call,
he's in the bathroom.

286
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,636
What the hell is wrong with him?

287
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,472
Never mind.

288
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:38,998
♪ A love song of the waterfall ♪

289
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:45,922
♪ I hear through
virgin timbertop... ♪

290
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,101
50 cents.

291
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,859
I'm not gonna see
that wrapper outside

292
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,694
- on the ground, now, am I?
- No, ma'am.

293
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,072
You one of those kids
caused me a bunch of shit?

294
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,241
- What?
- Empty your pockets.

295
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,702
Vest pocket. Come on.

296
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,957
Is that perfume?

297
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,833
That's none of your business.

298
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,169
Well, it smells really nice.

299
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,713
Yeah, well, it's European.

300
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,048
Oh.

301
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,591
Yeah, I'm expecting someone
in a minute.

302
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,510
Is it too much?

303
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,594
Not at all.

304
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,887
Smells expensive.

305
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,557
Well, it is.

306
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,393
You want a sucker?

307
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,270
Sure.

308
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,562
I like the green one.

309
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,231
This is a red one.

310
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,818
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.

311
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,613
Oh, shit. He's here.

312
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,750
Am I in the right place?

313
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,254
Oh! Right.

314
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,922
Told you it was big.

315
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,591
Oh, it's big.

316
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,718
What's that smell?

317
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,095
It's European.

318
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,640
Someone been smoking?

319
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,267
Um, he was.

320
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,601
- Can you believe it?
- What?

321
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,936
You know,
cigarettes kill people.

322
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,688
- Yeah, but...
- And animals.

323
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,983
Forest fires are the number one
cause of death for wildlife.

324
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,110
Yeah, and y-you should be
educating yourself

325
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,279
instead of endangering
the entire ecosystem.

326
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,031
Just get out of here.

327
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,616
- Get out.

328
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,745
Unbelievable.

329
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,039
You got a dusty beaver here, ranger.

330
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,125
Yeah, well, I'm working on that.

331
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,232
Hey, Henry!

332
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,110
It looks like the deer
on this sign are doing it!

333
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,654
Hold on.

334
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,867
Seriously, what the hell
are you even doing?

335
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,285
Marking our territory.

336
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,162
Ugh! Don't shit out here!

337
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,833
I'm not shitting.

338
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,588
Hey. Did your mom pack
double lunch for school again?

339
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,174
My dad didn't have a chance
to make any.

340
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,843
Hey, Henry.

341
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,730
Check it out.

342
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,776
It's drugs, I think.

343
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,403
It's drugs?

344
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,571
Remember that guy from assembly?

345
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,699
He showed us pictures of stuff
that looked just like this.

346
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,618
Yeah. The guy from Vietnam
with no legs.

347
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,245
No.

348
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,539
This is definitely cocaine.

349
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,040
Yeah. Of course.

350
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,876
I'm just not used to
seeing it like that.

351
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,965
You know, it's usually
more powdery on the streets.

352
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,217
When have you seen cocaine
on the streets?

353
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,552
When I do it.

354
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,678
Oh, yeah?

355
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,762
With who?

356
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,222
With faulk.

357
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,557
After church.

358
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,559
Faulk does not do cocaine
after church.

359
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,185
Are you friends with faulk?

360
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,353
No. He's a pervert.

361
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,813
Then you wouldn't know.

362
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,064
Liar.

363
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,316
You're just mad
you're never invited.

364
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,360
I don't care I'm not invited.

365
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,613
Sounds like you care.

366
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,408
Do some, then.

367
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,702
What?

368
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,829
You've done it before.
You can do it again.

369
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,749
Well, uh, we're exercising,
though. Shooting and stuff.

370
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,878
I mean, I can't do cocaine
while shooting and exercising.

371
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,463
That wouldn't be good.

372
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:57,755
Fine.

373
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,258
Knife me.

374
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,728
Okay, so how do I do it?

375
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,897
You eat it.

376
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,939
How much?

377
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,610
Like a tablespoon's worth.

378
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,246
Oh!

379
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,208
- Son of a bitch!

380
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,295
Oh, what the hell?

381
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,048
- Rookie.

382
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,717
You do it, then.

383
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,595
Ugh.

384
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,818
- Ah, shit!

385
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,654
What the hell?

386
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,032
This isn't as good
as the shit I normally do.

387
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,954
Ugh!

388
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,665
How much do you think
this stuff is worth?

389
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,625
Let's sell drugs together.

390
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,962
Yeah, we could sell them on
the street like you and faulk.

391
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,674
There's more.

392
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,177
Ow.

393
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,847
Something got into it.

394
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,307
A deer, maybe.

395
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Could you imagine that?
Deer on cocaine?
It'd be like this.
Yeah, it'd be, like,
going into trees like... bang!
- Bang!
- Yep, and then it'd get stuck.

396
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,026
Yeah, and then it'd be so sad.

397
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,196
Hey, Dee Dee. Do you think
my dad has ever done cocaine?

398
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,158
Your dad has definitely
done cocaine.

399
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
My throat's really runny.
Stop that.

400
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,557
Did it do the cocaine?

401
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,394
Don't move a muscle.

402
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,151
Listen to me.

403
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,404
You were supposed to grab Eddie,
not run your mouth.

404
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,531
Now we have trouble.
You understand? -Got it.

405
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,700
- I'll take care of it.

406
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,869
Gabe, knock that off. Gabe.

407
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,204
Grandpa Syd!
Gabe, driving me nuts.

She said he sang with the soul
of a thousand-year-old man.

No, I could've did more.

It's fine.

423
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,055
I should've been there.

00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,390
I didn't need you there.

00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,724
I don't hang out
with drug dealers anymore.

426
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,309
It's against my constitution.

427
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,269
I'm more than a drug dealer.

428
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,563
- No, you're not.
- Come on, Eddie.

429
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,023
We're friends, right?

430
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,108
No.

431
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,027
Fine.

432
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,363
I think he's happy she's dead.

433
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,823
He's not happy she died.

434
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,325
Blamed her for me leaving
the family business,

435
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,161
if we can call it that.

436
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,955
Sometimes...

437
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,332
- I wonder if he did it to her.
- What?

438
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,084
No, joanie died of cancer.

439
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,335
I know.

440
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,421
Maybe he gave her the cancer.

441
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,839
You can't give no one cancer.

442
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,507
Yes, you can. With stress.

443
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,551
Stop protecting him.

444
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,469
You know what?
Maybe I should turn this off.

445
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,555

00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,412
I'm wearing the stuff.

454
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:42,081
Oh. Did either of you
see a girl,

455
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,916
13, come through here?
My daughter...

456
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,960
You lost your daughter
in the park.

457
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,588
Well, she came here on her own,
heading to the waterfall.

458
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,674
Yeah. Hikers under 16 must be
accompanied by an adult.

459
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,509
Well, I didn't know
she was coming here.

460
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,136
You know, we get
a lot of runaways,

461
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,597
bad apples,
youngsters who aren't too happy

462
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,140
with the way things are at home.

463
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,475
She's not a runaway.

464
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,893
She just came to paint the...

465
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,394
Can someone just please point me

466
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,729
in the direction
of blood mountain?

467
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,773
This is blood mountain.

468
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,107
- Sorry. I-I'm Peter.
Oh.

469
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,692
This is Peter,
wildlife inspection rep.

470
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,570
We're about to head up there ourselves.

471
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,988
Oh. Do you mind if I tag along?

472
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,531
Now, Peter,
the wildlife inspection

473
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,908
is a very important process.

474
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,451
We wouldn't want you distracted

475
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,411
by our little
damsel in distress here.

476
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,954
Nothing can distract me

477
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,582
from making sure
the entire biological community

478
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,375
is safe for all our friends.

479
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,002
Friends?

480
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,962
- He means animals.
- I don't like that word.

481
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,423
He doesn't like
to call them animals.

482
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,843
Well, I won't be a burden.

483
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,597
I'll get my hat.

484
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,099
Okay.

485
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,979
Shoes okay for hiking?

486
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,898
Oh, yeah.
I-I think I'll be okay.

487
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,775
I have on boots.
- Yep.

488
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,443
Come on, Eddie.

489
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,153
I'm done playing this game.

490
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,404
You-you wanted...

491
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,989
You were the one
who wanted to play this.

492
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,950
You still have
three more questions.

493
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,119
Listen.
What?

494
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,372
I'm tired of playing
this fucking game.

495
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,123
No, you're not.
You just don't want to lose.

496
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,961
I'm-a go in here
and take a piss, all right?

497
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,551
I didn't know
rangers carried guns.

498
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,970
Park rangers are peace officers.

499
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,305
Which means we can shoot people.

500
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,766
Forest is a dangerous place.

501
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,018
That gang of pubes
are dangerous.

502
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,395
"Gang of pubes"?

503
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,772
Teens. Delinquents.

504
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,317
They've been attacking hikers.

505
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,819
They hurt anyone?

506
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,114
They cut them with a knife.

507
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,491
Call themselves the doochamps.

508
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,369
Watch your back.

509
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,997
Pop-art punks
pop up out of nowhere.

510
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,375
Out of nowhere.

511
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,307
Fuck is this?

512
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,393
He's afraid, buds.

513
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,186
Empty your pockets.

514
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,605
No.

515
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,191
Empty your pockets, please.

516
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,696
Since you asked so nicely.

517
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,491
You think this is a joke?

518
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,076
I do.

519
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,870
Get him, buds.

520
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,538
I'm shaking
a fucking knife, man. Come on.

521
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,373
Just stab him. -Come on, man.
It's a fucking knife!

522
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,959
- Go on!

523
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,880
Oh!

524
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,381
Come on, rocky. Come on, rocky.

525
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,967
- Come on, rocky.
- Ah! Banzai!

526
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,221
Give me this fucking board!

527
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,725
You're going down, man!

528
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,483
Submit! Submit!

529
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,902
What the...

530
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,405
Hold this!

531
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,867
Aah! Fucking skateboard!

532
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,714
Oh, my.

533
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,646
The fuck is wrong with y'all?!

534
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,273
Shit!

535
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,775
I love this road.

536
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,318
Ah, love it up there.

537
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,445
So, wait, where is it
that you wanted to go again?

538
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,947
What? The falls.

539
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,323
The secret falls. Right, well,
we can go up this way

540
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,950
- or take the loop.
I love the loop.

541
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,660
Well, you can see
the top of the...

542
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,620
This is a more direct...

543
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,497
All right. We're going this way.

544
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,165
Well, crap.

545
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,751
Told you she shouldn't
have come with us.

546
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,837
Just distracting you completely.

547
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,338
She can hear you.

548
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,925
I wanted to get up
to see the sunset.

549
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,469
- What's taking you so long?

550
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,431
What'd you do?

551
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,775
Please tell me
you found them like this.

552
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,818
They attacked me.

553
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,986
Are they dead?

554
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,362
Well, one might be.

555
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,866
The-the one that stabbed me
might be dead.

556
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,953
Jesus chr... they're kids.

557
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,289
I loved this fucking Jersey, man.

558
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,749
Okay, they're fine.

559
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,876
Thank god.

560
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,503
No fucking way.

561
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,840
Daveed?

562
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,681
What happened?

563
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,766
Hey.

564
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,017
- Wake up.

565
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,560
Where'd you find this?

566
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,020
Whoa.

567
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,647
Where is this energy
coming from, bud?

568
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,191
You tried to fucking kill me.

569
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,651
You got a foul mouth there, bud.

570
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,820
I tell him that all the time.

571
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,739
Where did you find this?

572
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,532
Up on the mountain.

573
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,617
Where's the rest of it?

574
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,494
I don't know.

575
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:15,164
Listen, I just took out
the three of you in 15 seconds.

576
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,707
What do you think I'll do
to just you

577
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,918
when you're already
on the floor?

578
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,961
Okay. Okay.

579
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,714
We stashed it under a gazebo.

580
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,591
Going back for it later tonight.

581
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,551
A gazebo?

582
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,721
It's a pavilion-type structure.

583
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,515
I know what the fuck
a gazebo is.

584
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,351
I didn't.

585
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,228
Are my buds dead?

586
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,896
- Show us where.
- Oh, god.

587
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,065
You know,
i-I'm feeling kind of tired.

588
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,566
I think I should rest.

589
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,568
Okay. Want a dirt nap?

590
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,986
Eddie, go get the gun.

591
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,404
It's in the glove.

592
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,739
I prefer we left guns
out of this.

593
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,699
Yeah. Same.

594
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,744
And I would prefer
not to be stabbed.

595
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,622
So, Eddie, please go get
the fucking gun.

596
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,416
Okay.

597
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,918
Okay.

598
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,086
All right, all right.

599
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,089
All right, I'm coming.

600
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,174
Relax.

601
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,102
It's getting real cold out.

602
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,661
Let's go.

603
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,789
So, where you guys from?

604
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,499
Shut up. Keep walking.

605
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,127
Gonna be a long hike
if we can't talk to each other.

606
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,129
It better not be a long hike.

607
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,463
Friend's
pretty serious, ain't he?

608
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,132
Well, I don't think
he's too happy

609
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,800
after getting stabbed
in the shoulder.

610
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,635
Well, it wasn't me.

611
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,137
Eh, I don't blame him, though.

612
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,638
Getting stabbed sucks.

613
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,099
Hey, shut the fuck up.

614
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,604

Yeah, reba, it's Bob.

621
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:17,077
I was wondering
how rosette is doing.

622
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,371
Realized I hadn't said
a proper goodbye.

623
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,956
I...

624
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:24,669
I don't know if dogs think about
that sort of thing, but, uh...

625
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,423
Anyway, I...

626
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,384
Thanks again for helping out.

627
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,012
Bye.

628
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,640
Look at this.

629
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,016
Oh, no.

630
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,268
Look at this mess.

631
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,312
People don't have any respect.

632
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,272
This is gonna end up
in scat, this plastic.

633
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,565
I... let me pick that up.

634
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,859
- All right. Thank you, ranger.
- Dee Dee!

635
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,819
That is sticking.
- I got some oil in the car.

636
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,029
Dee Dee! Henry!

637
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,530
'Cause if that stays open,

638
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,366
- critters can get in there.
- Oh, yeah, critters.

639
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,451
What kind of critters? Huh?

640
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,078
- Squirrels?
- Squirrels could get in there.

641
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,288
Chipmunks?
- Yeah, chipmunks get in there.

642
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,915
- Dee Dee!
Uh, skunks.

643
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,375
Raccoon, you know,
little burglar.

644
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,210
- That's right.
- Got his own little mask on.

645
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,211
Yeah, with their cute little
outfit. -I think they're cute.

646
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,671
Uh, skunks.

647
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:09,838
Skunks. Hmm.

648
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,965
- Possums.
Possums.

649
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,132
- Definitely possums.
- Possum.

650
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,218
- Uh...
- Hey, possum.

651
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,387
Mrs. Mckinndry!

652
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,763
Henry?

653
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,556
Here! Hello?

654
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,808
Henry?

655
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,394
Up here!

656
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,397
Hey. Whoa.
Oh.

657
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,357
Henry, what are you
doing up there?

658
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,441
No.

659
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,235
- No, that's not safe at all.
No.

660
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,404
It's too high.
You got to come down.

661
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,488
Get down here.

662
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,283
Don't be mad,
but we skipped school.

663
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,118
- No shit, Henry.
It's high.

664
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,661
But there was a bear.

665
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:41,996
A really terrible bear.

666
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,455
- A bear?
- Yeah, I know.

667
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,582
- It was fucked!
Hey!

668
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,376
That's inappropriate.

669
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,754
Sorry for cussing,
but it attacked me and Dee Dee.

670
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,214
It attacked you?

671
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,216
- Henry, where is Dee Dee?
No, no.

672
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,218
Bears are
very peaceful creatures.

673
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,928
You must have done something
to upset it.

674
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,888
- Yeah, did you feed it?
- What did you do?

675
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,974
Nothing! Y'all need to hide!

676
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,810
I'm telling you,
it's not just any bear!

677
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,854
You have to listen to me!

678
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,731
Henry, where is Dee Dee?

679
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,274
The monster took her.

680
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,610
Now, I'm not gonna
tell you again, little girl.

681
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,237
Get down here now.

682
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,781
- A...

683
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,908
- I...

684
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,619
Dee Dee!

685
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

686
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,680
Whoa!

687
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,932
Peter!

688
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,810
- No!
- Peter!

689
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,191
Oh! Oh, no!

690
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,026
It let me go! He ran off!

691
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:57,237
- Henry, jump down.
- It's too high.

692
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,697
Is it gone?

693
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,617
Do you see it?

694
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,416
Yeah.

695
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,710
Why are you shooting at me?

696
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,920
Get your ass down!

697
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,338
This is your fault.

698
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,882
Right behind you. I saw it.

699
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,343
Stay down.

700
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,187
What?

701
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

702
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,289
Help me!

703
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,959
Help!

704
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:58,048
Ranger! Ranger!

705
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,425
Did it get you?

706
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,969
That asshole!

707
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,262
I'm gonna get him.

708
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,806
I'm gonna get that asshole.

709
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,393
I'll get help.

710
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,894
Where are you going?

711
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,229
God almighty.

712
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,399
Hey. What...

713
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,402
Where is it?

714
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,613
Hey!

715
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,825
What should I do?

716
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,326
Motherfucker!

717
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,745
Come back! Help us!

718
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,999
Oh, fuck!

719
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,589
There's something wrong with it.

720
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,174
Yeah, I told you there was.

721
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,384
Why is it acting like this?

722
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,428
Did you feed it cocaine?

723
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,805
No. But you're safe.

724
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,765
Bears can't climb trees.

725
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,058
Of course they can!

726
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,020
Then why are you up here?

727
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:20,465
It's okay. It's okay.

728
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Okay.

729
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,001
No.

730
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,256
Henry, climb. Henry, go.

731
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,675
Climb! Climb!
You got to get higher!

732
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,218
- Climb.
Go, Henry!

733
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,511
Go!

734
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,639
- Henry, move!
- Go higher!

735
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,517
Go up!

736
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,602
Henry, go!

737
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,480
Oh, god.

738
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,983
Go, Henry! No!
- Whoa!

739
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,192
No!

740
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,237
Oh, god. Henry!

741
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,129
Oh, god.

742
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,632
Oh, shit.

743
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,346
No, no, no, no!

744
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,475
Get off of me! No, no!

745
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,812
- Get off! Get off of me!

746
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,028
Henry, jump! Jump down!

747
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,114
- Move, Henry!

748
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,830
It's okay. It's okay.
You're doing great.

749
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,416
You're almost there.
Come on, baby.

750
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,752
- Come on. Let's go.

751
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,713
Come on.

752
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,901
Go. Hide. Come here. Come here.

753
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,574
That was so messed up.

754
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,993
That little man
was an expert on bears

755
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,954
but didn't know the bear
was the cocaine bear.

756
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,665
Wait. What did you say?

757
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,124
We found cocaine,
Mrs. Mckinndry.

758
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,959
There was cocaine in the forest,
and the bear ate it

759
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,462
and then went crazy
on me and Dee Dee

760
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,964
and now on that guy back there.

761
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,841
Did you hear him scream?

762
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,094
He's so dead.

763
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,596
I'd love to not remember that.

764
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,598
But it kind of seems like

765
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,143
the thing that stays
with a man forever.

766
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:23,313
Henry, when the bear
took Dee Dee, was she...

767
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,315
Alive? Yeah.

768
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,984
It chased her that way.

769
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,821
We got to go. Let's go.

770
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,157
He get at you, too?

771
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,993
- Fucking beast.
- Yeah, you can say that again.

772
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,789
- Call an ambulance.
- I already did.

773
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,583
Keep him awake.

774
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,045
Yeah, I've been trying.

775
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,562
You piles of shit!

776
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:06,148
- You're the doochamps!
- Hey, that's-that's not ours.

777
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:07,817
We found it.

778
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,739
"It's not ours."

779
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,198
I'm a park ranger.

780
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,367
- I'm not dumb.
- I know.

781
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,035
They say I can't keep
my park safe,

782
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,538
that I'm unfit
for the big leagues.

783
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,457
I'd have been
at yellowstone by now

784
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,541
if it weren't for you shits!

785
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,042
- Buds.
Huh?

786
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,920
There's someone outside.

787
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,715
It's him. Get to the door.
Get to the door.

788
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:32,924
- Yeah.

789
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:36,845
Now, uh, open it
when I-I count to three.

790
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,847
Wait, wait.
But you're gonna shoot him?

791
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,348
Hell yes, I'm gonna shoot him!

792
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,767
He took a bite out of my ass!

793
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:44,187
What the fuck is wrong
with this guy?

794
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,899
Now, open it when I say so.

795
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,736
Now.

796
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,616
That's a fucking bear.

797
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,624
What the fuck?!

798
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,590
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

799
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,925
- You're sorry?
- I'm sorry.

800
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,344
- Where'd the bear go?
- You killed him.

801
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,428
Where's the bear?!

802
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,180
- I don't know!
- Close the door!

803
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:23,975
- Close the motherfucking door.
- Jesus Christ.

804
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,229
Close the door.

805
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,316
Oh, god. I'm sorry, bud.

806
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,242
Keep your mouth shut.
Check over there.

807
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,392
Shh.

808
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,521
He's up there.

809
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:10,982
He's up there.

810
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,807
I got it. I got it.

811
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

812
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,693
Maybe the kid can help you.

813
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,862
Look, I'm done
playing this game.

814
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,697
- What game?
- 20 questions.

815
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,199
Daveed's so fucking cold.
It's unbelievable.

816
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,702
- What did he ask so far?
- He just keeps guessing.

817
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,829
Like, "is it a spider?

818
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,873
- Is it an arrow?"

819
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,251
What are you, new?

820
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,253
Hey, start broad,
then narrow it down.

821
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,546
Everybody knows that.

822
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,340
Look, are we close
to the gazebo?

823
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:19,925
Is that one of your questions?

824
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,635
Oh, is it bigger
than a bread box?

825
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,888
No, no, no. Daveed needs to ask.

826
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:27,224
Ask him if it's bigger
than a bread box.

827
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,937
Is it bigger than a bread box?

828
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,396
- Yes.
- Whoo!

829
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,731
Yeah!

830
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,524
Is it Abraham Lincoln?

831
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,693
What? No.

832
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,905
Broad, then narrow it down, man.

833
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,075
You have one question left.

834
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

835
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,841
Dee Dee! Dee Dee!

836
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,467
You sure this is the way?

837
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,554
Pretty sure.

838
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,643
Dee Dee! It's okay.

839
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,312
It's mama.

840
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,816
Oh.

841
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,526
Thank god.

842
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,486
- Ew! What the heck?

843
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,780
It's paint. It's just red paint.

844
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,324
It looks a lot like blood.
How can you be sure?

845
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,285
I'm a nurse, Henry.

846
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,996
Good point.

847
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,874
Come on.

848
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,172
Oh, smart girl.

849
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,425
Henry, come on.
She left us a trail.

850
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,678
Mrs. Mckinndry,
have you ever done cocaine?

851
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,346
What?

852
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,515
Why do you ask?

853
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,018
Just wondering if it has
long-term side effects...

854
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,271
For the bear, of course,
if it just did a little bit.

855
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,691
Well, it could create
a habit for the bear.

856
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,194
What if they never want
to do it again?

857
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,863
Oh, then it-it should be fine.

858
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,741
But mama bear and papa bear
would be very angry

859
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,993
because drugs...
Especially cocaine...

860
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,162
Are very, very bad.

861
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,914
What if they would
never find out?

862
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:57,540
Oh, Henry.

863
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,751
We always find out.

864
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,628

- Just open it.

871
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,282
Yeah, open it. You think?

872
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,409
Can you just push?
Harder. -

873
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,911

- Let me do it.

00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,164
You go. Yeah.

876
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,582
Please, show me how it's done.

877
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,877
Go ahead, Beth.
You're strong, right?

878
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,963
Oh, yes, I am. Let me see.

879
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,006
What is that?

880
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,008
- See anything?
- Just, can you...

881
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,426
- Can you help? Can you help?
- Yeah.

882
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,262
What happened to feminism, huh?
Is that dead?

883
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,265
- Come on.
- Wait. Okay, wait, wait, wait.

884
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,268
Oh, fuck.

885
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,644
- Come on.

886
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,271
God, I'm trying.

887
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,939
- Come on, push.

888
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,274
I'm trying.

889
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,402
You said they called in
a concussion.

890
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,989
They did.

891
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,827
Jesus.

892
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,495
This guy's been shot.

893
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,165
Yeah. Obviously.

894
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,834
Holy shit.

895
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:23,960
It's the ranger.

896
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,295
- Tom.

897
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,298
Come here. She's got a gun.

898
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,302
Tom! Hello?

899
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,347
No, no. Put that down.
Put that down.

900
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,308
It's okay.

901
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:40,310
- B...
- Did you shoot that guy?

902
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,313
B... b...

903
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:44,481
"Buh"?

904
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:56,535
B... b...

905
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Beth?
It's okay. It's okay. Calm.

906
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,726
Uh...

907
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,291
Beth, we should go.

908
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:47,211
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

909
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Bear.
Bear.

910
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,894
- Let's go.

911
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,772
Tom, get up!

912
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,279
Don't look back.
Don't look back.

913
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,744
Hang on. Push.

914
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,208
Oh, shit.

915
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,420
- Sorry. Sorry.

916
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,135
- Come on. Come on.

917
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:38,428
Anybody else surprised by

918
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,971
that rain this morning?
I know I was.

919
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:41,557
Leave him!

920
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:00,783

00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,702

Like, what-what do you say to
a kid who just lost his mommy?

960
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:11,080
My mom is the reason
I'm the man I am today.

961
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,582
And what a man you are.

962
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,667
Attacking innocent people
for no reason.

963
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,918
Can you not?

964
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,087
I'm sorry. Just continue.

965
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,089
Well, when my daddy died,

966
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,425
my mama bought me
this pet lizard.

967
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,385
It was the coolest little thing.

968
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,554
It had all these
green scales on it.

969
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:28,973
She used to call it
a tiny dinosaur.

970
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,641
I thought that was so awesome.

971
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,352
I was real bad
at connecting with people,

972
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,062
but I practiced
conversation starters

973
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,856
on that lizard every day.

974
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:40,027
And then
that's how I met rocky and Joe.

975
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:42,945
That's my team, man.

976
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:46,366
We're planning on moving
to New York City together.

977
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,286
Those are my buds, man.

978
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,914
So I should get Gabe a lizard?

979
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:55,625
Well, you know what?

980
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:59,295
Lizards are good listeners, bud,

981
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,339
but people...

982
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,926
People are good at hearing.

983
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:11,140
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard. Thank you.

984
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,767
- Can we...
- It's okay.

985
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,894
Y'all are hugging.

986
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:17,356
It's okay.

987
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,069
Where the fuck is the gazebo?

988
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:39,438
Can I say something without you
getting angry with me?

989
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,899
I'm already angry with you.

990
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,071
It's gone.

991
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,406
What the actual...

992
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,907
- No! Please, please!
- Daveed, stop.

993
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,451
No, no, no. The kid's
messing with us, Eddie.

994
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:54,827
No, no, no! I'm not!
I'm not! I'm not!

995
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,495
I-I promise.
I-I don't know where it went.

996
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,872
It's just gone.

997
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:00,041
Okay, well,
duffel bags don't have legs.

998
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,251
Since you're the only one
that knew where it was,

999
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,503
i'm-a give you one more chance.

1000
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:06,130
Where's the ba...

1001
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,092
Put the gun down
and move away from the teenager.

1002
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:15,431
Drop the weapon and step away
about five to ten paces.

1003
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,017
All right, listen.
Just calm down, all right?

1004
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,436
I ain't fucking around.

1005
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,606
Just do it.

1006
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,942
Fuck.

1007
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,028
- You don't want to do this.
- Shut up!

1008
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:31,698
I'm coming down there.

1009
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,624
Uh...

1010
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:46,838
Uh...

1011
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,175
- Uh...

1012
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,135
Shh!

1013
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,136
I'm just trying to...

1014
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,263
Find a safe spot to hop down.

1015
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,973
How did you get up there?

1016
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,309
Well, I jumped from that tree
over there, but...

1017
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,811
I hurt my hip a little.

1018
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,521
I can try to catch you
if you want.

1019
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:07,109
No, no!
You stay right where you are!

1020
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,152
Let's, uh, see, uh...

1021
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,446
Get it.

1022
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,950
Fuck!

1023
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:17,327
Fuck!

1024
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:20,329
Well, you brought that
on yourself, kid.

1025
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,165
Oh, yeah?
I shot my own fucking fingers?

1026
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,709
I told you not to move.

1027
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,795
How'd he take
those two fingers off?

1028
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:29,840
They're not even
next to each other.

1029
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,176
Fuck you!

1030
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,011
Come out of there!

1031
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,596
Shit! Come on out!

1032
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,516
No fucking way!

1033
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:42,894
God! Goddamn it!

1034
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,188
You two, on your bellies.

1035
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,233
Now! And no more moving.

1036
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,318
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

1037
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,611
Can you grab them for me?

1038
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,029
Can I grab his fingers?

1039
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,699
Okay. Get 'em. Get 'em.

1040
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,744
Slow. Slow.

1041
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,705
Easy.

1042
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,249
Ugh, god.

1043
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,710
All right.

1044
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,336
Now, you get back on your belly.

1045
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,214
I'll hold on to these.

1046
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,930
Now, where you at?

1047
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,058
Shit.

1048
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,602
What?

1049
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,146
Oh, no. The river.

1050
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,232
Henry, look.

1051
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,234
That's Dee Dee's sweater.

1052
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,528
- Come on.
- So we're crossing?

1053
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,322
We're on the right track.

1054
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,033
I can feel it.

1055
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,092
Mama?

1056
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,470
Fuck.

1057
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,305
Fuck, man.

1058
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,767
My fucking Jersey, man.

1059
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,937
How long are you gonna
keep us like this?

1060
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,605
Until that guy in the gazebo

1061
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,357
throws his weapon
into the woods.

1062
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,317
Well, then we'll be here forever.

1063
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,820
Hasn't Syd already
messed your life up enough?

1064
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,696
We don't need to die
because of this.

1065
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,698
Eddie, I got this.

1066
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:20,950
Do you?

1067
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:23,786
I have your fingers
in my pocket.

1068
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,454
You're all gonna get arrested.

1069
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,748
Drug sentences since Nixon
are fucked,

1070
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,501
so get ready for ten to 15 years

1071
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,586
of shitting
in front of your cellmate

1072
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,296
and supervised shower time.

1073
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:36,799
Detective, your honor, sir,
I'm not with them.

1074
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,551
I've never even done coke.

1075
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:41,637
I mean, maybe once.
Once... at a party once.

1076
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,806
- I can't go to jail.
- You're not going to jail.

1077
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,349
Just saying, I can't shit
in front of people.

1078
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,309
I've never been able to shit
in front of people.

1079
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,229
I like to shit in peace.

1080
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,945
Nobody move.

1081
01:00:58,405 --> 01:00:59,697
It's a bear.

1082
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:01,365
Yeah.

1083
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,117
No, no.

1084
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,996
I'm not falling
for none of your...

1085
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,102
Oh, fuck.

1086
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:32,354
Hey, y'all just stay still.
Don't move.

1087
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,732
Just play dead.

1088
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,217
Shh.

1089
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,079
Oh, fuck.

1090
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,421
Oh, man. You fucked.

1091
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,547
Eddie, can you breathe?

1092
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,508
What the fuck?

1093
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,094
I think that's a yes.

1094
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,679
Can someone do something?

1095
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,097
Maybe your boy can do something.

1096
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,934
Can you just, like... move it?

1097
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,854
Oh, of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

1098
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,150
Dee Dee!

1099
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,279
Henry, stay close.
I haven't seen paint in a while.

1100
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,282
Oh, god.

1101
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,243
Look.

1102
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,996
Hello.

1103
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:15,749
- Is he okay?

1104
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,627
Help me, please.

1105
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,587
Does he have food?

1106
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:22,965
Her name was Elsa,

1107
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,385
and she was so beautiful.

1108
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,554
Are-are you... are you hurt?

1109
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,806
Were you attacked?

1110
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,559
Devil bear.

1111
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,768
My... I'm looking
for my daughter.

1112
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:35,978
She was attacked
by the devil bear.

1113
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,187
Have you seen her?

1114
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,731
You have?

1115
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,941
- Was she alive?
Yes.

1116
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,484
Please, can you just point
to where she went?

1117
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,403
Please, can you show me?
I'm looking for her.

1118
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:45,446
I haven't...

1119
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:46,990
Henry!

1120
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:03,173
I'll show you. Come.

1121
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,430
It's not moving.

1122
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,766
I think it died.

1123
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,851
It died on top of me?

1124
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,102
Check its pulse.

1125
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,688
Can you, like,
feel it breathing?

1126
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,025
I'm not sure.

1127
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:26,195
Uh, hey, guy?

1128
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,321
Detective.

1129
01:04:27,322 --> 01:04:28,363
Can we call a truce

1130
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,365
so I can see
if the bear is dead?

1131
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,576
Yeah.

1132
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,332
Fuck.

1133
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,796
You okay?

1134
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:46,049
What do you think?

1135
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,234
S-Still breathing.

1136
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,569
We should go.

1137
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,947
He'll probably be all right.

1138
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:12,032
What the hell, man?

1139
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,408
He's gonna wake up eventually.

1140
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,452
Well, that's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

1141
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:16,745
"She."

1142
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,080
What?

1143
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:19,915
The bear is a girl.

1144
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,458
Oh, yeah.
H-How do you know that?

1145
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,546
Because its vagina is on my ear.

1146
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,465
Oh, shit. She's moving.

1147
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,883
She's awake.

1148
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:32,261
Oh, shit.
Well, stay back. Stay back.

1149
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,931
Okay.

1150
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:40,811
Chill out. Just chill out!

1151
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:42,771
Ooh. Homes, hey, hey.

1152
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,482
- Stay back.

1153
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,112
What the hell?

1154
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:52,949
Okay. Okay.

1155
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:58,121
No, no, no, no.
Don't eat that. Don't eat that.

1156
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:00,789
I will be goddamned.

1157
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,291
Should we shoot her?

1158
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:05,753
No. Let's see what kind
of effect that has on it.

1159
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:09,632
What the fuck?

1160
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:24,980
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

1161
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,899
- Eddie!
Daveed, help.

1162
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,526
What is this?

1163
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:30,986
- No, no.

1164
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,738
- Ooh! Okay, I have...
What is it doing?

1165
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,489
I-I don't like this.

1166
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,908
Please stop.

1167
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:37,994
- Just go limp! Slide down!
- I'm limp already.

1168
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,955
- Shoot the bear! Shoot her!
Don't shoot!

1169
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,124
No, no. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

1170
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,250
Eddie, you got to fight back,
all right?

1171
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,335
It's-it's playing with you.

1172
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:47,836
I'd stay still if I were you.

1173
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,047
Bud, just tap out, bud.
Bud, tap out!

1174
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,466
Eddie, please don't die
like this. Eddie, please.

1175
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:53,717
Daveed!

1176
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,510
All we've been through! Come on!

1177
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:56,845
Come on, help him!

1178
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,847
Get lower. You're not listening!

1179
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,183
- Eddie.

1180
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,977
Oh, my god. He's gonna die.

1181
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:06,521
No!

1182
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,233
Hey, girl.

1183
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,618
There you go, girl.

1184
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,371
There you go.

1185
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,873
There you go.

1186
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:28,378
It's like cocaine Christmas.

1187
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:44,559
Go!

1188
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,480
Don't have to tell me twice.

1189
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,566
Come on!

1190
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,651
Daveed!

1191
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:54,236
That bag's worth 14 million.

1192
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:57,239
We had a truce, and a truce
is on god where I'm from.

1193
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,867
Can't you see I'm trying
to help you, kid? Go!

1194
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,577
I need that bag.

1195
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,663
Leave it, man.
Let's just go home.

1196
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:07,250
We're taking that bag
to Syd, Eddie.

1197
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:19,262
Shot...

1198
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:23,182
No. I didn't.

1199
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:29,272
Run! Go, go!

1200
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:32,734
Oh, shit!

1201
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:48,623
Holy shit.

1202
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,751
- Dad. What are you doing here?
Oh, shit.

1203
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:51,960
Where's Gabe?

1204
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,211
You didn't bring him here,
did you?

1205
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,921
- Calm down.

1206
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:57,007
He's safe at home watching TV.

1207
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:58,925
What?
How long has he been alone?

1208
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,510
You left him with me!

1209
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:03,639
Do I look like
"daddy day care center" to you?

1210
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,309
- Huh?

1211
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,103
- The fuck happened to you?
- A lot.

1212
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,689
- Did you get the coke?
- A little.

1213
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,775
The bear ate most of it.

1214
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:16,818
- What?
- The bear.

1215
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,779
It fucking did cocaine.

1216
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,280
A fucking...

1217
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:22,616
A bear did cocaine, dad!

1218
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:23,658
Fuck this!

1219
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:26,787
Seriously,
fuck this entire journey.

1220
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:28,705
Eddie, Eddie, just calm down.

1221
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:31,708
Look at me. Look at me.

1222
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,502
I'm on the hook here.

1223
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:38,340
A lot of cocaine was lost
under my eye.

1224
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,217
And the people that I deal with,

1225
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:42,719
they don't care how,
just that it was.

1226
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,638
And look at me.

1227
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:48,183
They're gonna come after me,
my family

1228
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:51,686
if I don't get them
every penny's worth.

1229
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,605
You hear what I'm saying?

1230
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,566
It's you and Gabe.

1231
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,528
You understand?

1232
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,949
We don't have a choice.

1233
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,327
There's a bag
with the cop and the bear

1234
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,455
over at the pavilion structure.

1235
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:12,708
Come on.

1236
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,880
Come on, son. Come on.

1237
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,389
Who's there?

1238
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,391
Easy.
Stay away.

1239
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,017
Where's the duffel?

1240
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:32,727
I gave it to the bear.

1241
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,729
You gave it to the bear?

1242
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,858
Yeah. The bear.

1243
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:39,402
It loves coke.

1244
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,279
Wh-which way did it go?

1245
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,239
I'm not fucking around here.

1246
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,741
Syd white.

1247
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,286
Man, I've been following you
for years.

1248
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,080
They all have.

1249
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,587
Reba.

1250
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:01,173
Oh, I always knew
you were my girl.

1251
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:02,424
I got you now.

1252
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,426
Be careful
when you cuff these guys.

1253
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,012
They're kind of shifty.

1254
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,851
What...

1255
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,437
What are you doing?

1256
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:20,317
- I'm sorry, Bob.
- I'm sorry, Bob.

1257
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,194
You shot him?

1258
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:23,320
I told you not to hurt him.

1259
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:25,071
I don't work for you.

1260
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,698
The department trusted you.

1261
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:30,410
The state of Tennessee
trusted you.

1262
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:35,123
The United States of America,
it trusted you.

1263
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,791
I know.

1264
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,252
- I trusted you with rosette.
- I know.

1265
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:41,171
Who's rosette?

1266
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:42,422
The dog in my car.

1267
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:43,965
You left a dog in the car?

1268
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,926
You left my son in Saint Louis.

1269
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:47,803
How is she?

1270
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,521
She being a good girl?

1271
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:00,106
Yeah. She's such a good girl.

1272
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:01,483
E-Enough.

1273
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:03,610
Tell me which way the bear went,

1274
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:06,238
or I'm gonna kill the dog
when I come down mountain.

1275
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,740
Oh, no, no, please,
d-don't-don't do that.

1276
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:11,034
I'd vote for not
killing the dog today,

1277
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:12,911
but that's just me.

1278
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,663
Well, what do you guys say?

1279
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,999
What's so funny?

1280
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,503
Apex predator,

1281
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:24,840
high on cocaine,
and you're going towards it.

1282
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:33,431
Dead north, man.

1283
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,392
- Yes, we will.

1284
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:38,228
Dead... dead north.

1285
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:39,897
Let's go.

1286
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,024
The devil bear is in there.

1287
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:26,568
You can't go in there.

1288
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:29,070
Do you have kids?

1289
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,572
We would have.

1290
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:32,324
I have to go find mine.

1291
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,577
And his name would be Texas.

1292
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,079
- Do you have a flashlight?
- Yeah.

1293
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:43,836
Here.

1294
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,087
Thank you.

1295
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,757
Bye, lady and little man.

1296
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,551
Bye, you both.

1297
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:54,262
Okay.

1298
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,515
Wait. What about me?

1299
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,622
Watch where you step.

1300
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,834
- I got you. Stay close.

1301
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,464
What's that?

1302
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,552
Don't move.

1303
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,180
Stay still, Henry.

1304
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,354
They look like polar bears.

1305
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:45,730
Henry?

1306
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:46,691
Dee Dee?

1307
01:14:46,692 --> 01:14:48,149
Dee Dee?
- Mama!

1308
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,943
Don't move. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1309
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,153
No, no. Them, they're...
They're harmless. -Dee Dee!

1310
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,615
- Mama, I just...
- Baby!

1311
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:56,574
Dee Dee, you're okay.

1312
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:57,909
Are you hurt?

1313
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,327
- It's just my leg.
- Your leg?

1314
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:00,745
That looks really deep.

1315
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,997
Here. Don't touch it.
- Ow! Ow! Henry!

1316
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,457
Let's keep you warm.

1317
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,000
Oh, my gosh.
You found my sweater.

1318
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,293
You smart girl.

1319
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:09,003
- You left us clues.
- Yeah.

1320
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,380
We found you.

1321
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:11,881
Put that on.

1322
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,884
- Mom, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I love you so much.

1323
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,386
Oh, my god.

1324
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:17,846
Mom, i'm-I'm so sorry.

1325
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:19,097
- I'm sorry. I just...
- It's okay.

1326
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:20,140
Henry told me everything.

1327
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:21,683
Everything?

1328
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:22,892
You mean that
you guys did drugs?

1329
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:24,561
- You told her?
No.

1330
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,521
I had a suspicion,
and you just confirmed it.

1331
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,815
I'm just so glad I found you
and you're okay.

1332
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:32,736
- Um, what was that?

1333
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:34,822
Cocaine bear's back.

1334
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,449
- Can you walk?
- Uh, a little.

1335
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:38,950
Come on. Let's go, Henry.

1336
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,243
Go that way.

1337
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,495
Go ahead.

1338
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,331
It's okay. Come on.

1339
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,418
Look. It's a way out.

1340
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:53,132
It's the falls.
Oh, wow.

1341
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:05,143
Henry, stay away from the ledge!

1342
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:07,104
Oh, god.

1343
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,988
This is it.

1344
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,909
Syd, let's cut our losses.

1345
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:05,495
All right? Let's just deal
with the fallout.

1346
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:08,374
You saw what that bear did
to that hiker.

1347
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,879
What is that?

1348
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,923
- Oh, fuck!

1349
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:19,176
What the fuck? What the fuck?

1350
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:23,180
Come on.

1351
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,228
Eddie.

1352
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,314
Take this.

1353
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:38,988
Fuck.

1354
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,079
Thank you.

1355
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:58,631
Goddamn bear.

1356
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:00,217
Eddie, put the rest in the bag.

1357
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,519
You got what you wanted?

1358
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,855
Let's go.

1359
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:19,235
There's-there's a lot more
out there.

1360
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:22,197
We got to keep looking, understand?

1361
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,200
We're not whole yet.

1362
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,162
I'm leaving, Syd.

1363
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:33,709
Go.

1364
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,235
Give me the bag.

1365
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:04,030
When did you all get so soft?

1366
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:07,159
All got sand in your pussies.

1367
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:12,664
Mom! How are we gonna
get out of here?

1368
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,707
It's a dead end. What do we do?

1369
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,418
Stay away from the bears.

1370
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:21,756
This way.

1371
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,508
Come on. There's an opening.

1372
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:25,593
Henry, come here.

1373
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,055
Dee Dee, get in here.
Someone's coming.

1374
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,809
He has a gun.

1375
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:38,022
No!

1376
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:39,483
Come on!

1377
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,068
The hell is this?

1378
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,570
Whoa. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1379
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:46,489
- Dad.
- Who are you?

1380
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,116
I'm a mom.

1381
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:51,119
Syd, there's kids here.
Let's just go.

1382
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,371
No, I'm not leaving
without that cocaine!

1383
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:56,791
So somebody better bring it down
or somebody else is gonna die.

1384
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,335
You understand?

1385
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,171
Go.

1386
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:04,133
Come on. Help him out!
- Yeah, yeah.

1387
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:10,263
It's stuck.

1388
01:20:10,264 --> 01:20:11,390
Fuck!

1389
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:14,309
Who are these guys?

1390
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:17,687
We're going home.

1391
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:19,856
W-We're not gonna say anything,
but we're going home.

1392
01:20:19,857 --> 01:20:21,400
Nobody's going anywhere!

1393
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:24,861
- Dad.
- Shut up, Eddie.

1394
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:26,655
- Dad!
- Shut...

1395
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:30,324
Get away. Back off. Back off.

1396
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:31,993
Get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1397
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:34,328
- Fuck.

1398
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:36,164
Get back! Get... fuckers!

1399
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,540
- Stay away.

1400
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:38,624
- Whoa.
Stay away.

1401
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:39,751
Whoa. He hit the bear.

1402
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,085
Just give 'em the bag.

1403
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,962
Shoot the fucking bears!

1404
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,297
- Get over here.
- Dee Dee and Henry: Whoa!

1405
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:46,007
Hey, can't get a shot.
They're too close to me!

1406
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:48,009
Give them the fucking coke.
They're little cubs.

1407
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,970
The fuck's the matter with you?

1408
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,848
Shoot the little
fucking cubs, Eddie!

1409
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,266
Get 'em off me!

1410
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:56,726
- Fuck him.
Help me out!

1411
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,311
Ow. Eddie!

1412
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:00,022
- Ow!
- No.

1413
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,232
Coward. Daveed!

1414
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:04,568
Here, catch.

1415
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:10,866
I am taking
the fucking children home.

1416
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:12,950
Mama!

1417
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:15,912
Hell yeah, Mrs. Mckinndry.

1418
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:17,121
Look around, dad.

1419
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,165
Kids have been dragged
into this.

1420
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:21,542
Get-get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1421
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,377
People are dead.

1422
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,463
You are no son of mine.

1423
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:26,714
Hey, you!

1424
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,216
You did this.

1425
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:29,717
You're the reason
this is all happening.

1426
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:32,053
And it's a good thing
he's not like you,

1427
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:34,263
because you're
a piece of crap person

1428
01:21:34,264 --> 01:21:36,390
and a bad dad!

1429
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:37,725
Who the fuck are you?

1430
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,894
I'm Henry,

1431
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,563
and I am so fucking tired!

1432
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:43,732
Yeah, me, too.

1433
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:12,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1434
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,762
She's protecting the cubs.

1435
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:15,847
Oh, shit!

1436
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:17,306
- We need to jump.
- Wait, what?

1437
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:18,641
- What? I'll be fine!
It's gonna be okay.

1438
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:19,934
We're gonna be okay.

1439
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,144
Here, here, here.

1440
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:22,562
Have some coke,
you little shits.

1441
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:24,147
- Get out of here!
- It's not that far, you guys.

1442
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:26,983
- We're gonna be all right.

1443
01:22:26,984 --> 01:22:28,651
- Ready?
Mm-hmm.

1444
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:31,905
Three, two, one. Jump!

1445
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,453
- Oh, shit.

1446
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,799
Oh, shit. We got to jump.

1447
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:55,596
Let's go!

1448
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:29,171
- Come on. It's okay.

1449
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:33,008
Eddie. Help.
We made it.

1450
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:26,061
Get the shit out of here,
you fuck!

1451
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:05,474
- Oh, shit. He shot you.

1452
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:08,270
Help! Help!

1453
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:15,443
S-Six more days of John.

1454
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,111
Okay.

1455
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,988
Six more days...

1456
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:21,365
I need you to know,
what I said earlier...

1457
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:23,534
You're more than a drug dealer,
all right?

1458
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:25,369
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.

1459
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,748
- All right?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1460
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:31,334
Hey, hey, I...

1461
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:33,502
I got my last question.

1462
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:34,795
What?

1463
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,297
It's 20 questions.

1464
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:38,132
I got my last one.

1465
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,844
What? All right. Sure.

1466
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:45,264
Is it joanie?

1467
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:46,807
It's joanie, right?

1468
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,477
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1469
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:51,270
How'd you guess?

1470
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:53,981
You're so fucking obvious.

1471
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:55,941
I just didn't want to guess it

1472
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:57,819
to have you crying on me
all day.

1473
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:09,622
She's a nurse!

1474
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:11,332
He-he got grazed by a bullet.

1475
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,666
He's in shock.

1476
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:14,378
Put pressure on him.

1477
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:14,687
I've called backup.

1478
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:17,232
Her name's rosette.
She doesn't like fetch.

1479
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:20,192
You should get going.

1480
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:22,404
Take care of yourself.

1481
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:30,704
Hi. Hi.

1482
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,748
Rosette.

1483
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:46,427
Whose dog is this?

1484
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:48,012
I think it's mine.

1485
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:49,763
Mine and Gabe's.

1486
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:51,098
Is it on cocaine?

1487
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:53,018
No.

1488
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:56,605
That's a good dog.

1489
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:00,983
So we just grab Gabe
and go, right?

1490
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:02,486
Yeah.

1491
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:07,865
I knew you'd be okay.

1492
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:10,284
You're the toughest person
I know.

1493
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,245
I think you get that
from your mom.

1494
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:14,622
I think you're right.

1495
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:16,790
Thanks for coming to get me.

1496
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:19,043
I'm your mom. I love you.

1497
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,712
You, too, Henry.

1498
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:24,215
Hey, I'm sorry I pushed ray
on you too soon.

1499
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,968
No. You deserve to be happy.

1500
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,845
Henry, let's walk over here.

1501
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:32,223
- Stay away from that. Come on.
I want to look.

1502
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:33,641
I also don't want to look.

1503
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:35,351
Ugh.
Don't look.

1504
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:37,645
- Let's just cruise on by.

1505
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:40,231
Oh, here come the po-po.

1506
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:41,607
Hey, mom.

1507
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:43,859
I want to go to Nashville
with you and ray.

1508
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,946
Maybe we can go after
me and Henry get out of rehab.

1509
01:28:46,947 --> 01:28:48,322
Rehab?

1510
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:50,032
We're cokeheads now.

1511
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:51,492
You know?

1512
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:53,035
We got the bite,
and we're about that life,

1513
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:54,453
- Mrs. Mckinndry.
Mm-hmm.

1514
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,790
Yeah, you're
too grounded for rehab.

1515
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:14,014
Rodney, are you getting it?

1516
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:16,058
I swear to god, Carol.

1517
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:17,643
Well, then zoom in.

1518
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:19,854
- Is the red light on?
- No, I got it.

1519
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:22,565
Oh, they're so cute.

1520
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:24,149
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1521
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,359
Wait.

1522
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,027
Why are they looking
at us like that?

1523
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,779
Oh.

1524
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,322
Oh, shit.
