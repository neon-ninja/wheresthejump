1
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,897
Yeah, she'd like that, I'm sure.

2
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,106
Can you imagine?

3
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,192
Such a good daughter!

4
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,403
I mean, the poor thing's been taking care
of her for years.

5
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,363
What she sacrificed.

6
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,493
At least now she will be free to go back.

7
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,832
Can she ever really
perform again? It's been a decade.

8
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,918
Well, what else is she gonna do?

9
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:28,338
Uh, I don't know.
I don't think she even knows.

10
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,678
<i>Anton,</i>

11
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,011
<i>Paloma,</i>

12
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,973
<i>it's Charlotte Willmore.</i>

13
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,143
<i>Anton,</i>

14
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,602
<i>Paloma...</i>

15
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,814
<i>Anton,</i>

16
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,192
<i>Paloma, it's Charlotte Willmore.</i>

17
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,486
<i>Yes, it's me. Hi.</i>

18
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,284
<i>Anton, Paloma. Hi.</i>

19
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,786
<i>It's Charlotte Willmore.</i>

20
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,205
<i>I don't know where you are in the world.</i>

21
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,292
<i>Scouting young cellists
somewhere exotic, I'm sure.</i>

22
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:53,047
<i>Anyway, um, I know it's been forever,
but my mother finally passed away</i>

23
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,300
<i>and I'm not needed here anymore.</i>

24
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,384
<i>So...</i>

25
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,385
<i>if it's okay,</i>

26
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,512
<i>I'd like to come and join you.</i>

27
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,161
Charlotte.

28
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,603
Paloma and I are so sorry
about your mother.

29
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,360
After a five-month search
over three continents,

30
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,153
we are thrilled to bring our

31
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:44,409
remarkable finalists together
in Shanghai for one last concert.

32
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,995
The Bachoff Academy in Boston,

33
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,707
founded by my grandfather Emil in 1927,

34
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,668
is quite frankly the premiere
private music facility

35
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,045
for young cellists in the world.

36
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,382
And each year, we teach hundreds
of day students in Massachusetts,

37
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,677
but only a select handful
are given the opportunity

38
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,264
privilege, really,
to reside and study at the Academy,

39
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,434
which is why I'm so excited
that the winner tonight will receive

40
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,729
a four-year live-in scholarship
to Bachoff.

41
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,236
Now, the fact

42
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,323
that my most prized protégé,

43
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,327
Elizabeth Wells, one of the best
young cellists on the planet,

44
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,872
will be judging tonight's final concert
is testament

45
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,000
to just how talented
these three young ladies are.

46
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,422
Listening to Lizzie play music so...
pure, so perfect

47
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,633
is as close to God as you can get.

48
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,195
Well, it's as close to God
as I want to get for the time being.

49
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,971
Uh...

50
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,766
But Lizzie's not the only surprise we have
for you this evening.

51
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,934
For four glorious years,

52
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,480
I trained Charlotte Willmore at Bachoff.

53
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,648
Charlotte was a rare and gifted talent

54
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:02,153
poised for the type of greatness
achieved by very few,

55
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,738
but then as all of you know,

56
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,865
Charlotte's beloved mother, Ruth,

57
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,574
got sick.

58
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,373
Charlotte put her career on hold,
and went back home care for her mother.

59
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,792
This is the heart of Charlotte.

60
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,308
I was thrilled that Charlotte reached out
to Paloma and myself,

61
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,977
thrilled that after nearly a decade,

62
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,270
she's back in our lives.

63
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,649
Ladies and gentlemen,
our second judge for this evening,

64
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,025
Charlotte Willmore.

65
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,458
It's baijiu. Chinese vodka.

66
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,377
Two shots will have you
fluent in Mandarin.

67
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,920
Charlotte!

68
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,964
Good, I was looking for you.

69
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,883
You must remember these two
grueling taskmasters from the Academy?

70
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,970
Oh, my goodness.
It's so wonderful to see you.

71
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,596
Theis and Geoffrey.

72
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,640
And after all these years! Mm.

73
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,851
Charlotte, there you are!

74
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,103
Would you excuse us?

75
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,440
I want to introduce you,
before we have to go upstairs and start.

76
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,191
She's so excited to meet you.

77
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,280
And here she is, Charlotte, my star.

78
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,240
- Elizabeth...
- Elizabeth Wells.

79
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,450
Of course.

80
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,202
Lizzie, please.

81
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,203
Hey.

82
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,209
Your music, Lizzie,
it's something more than beautiful.

83
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,629
I mean, I'm sorry.

84
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,425
Am I the luckiest man in the world?
I don't even drink and I feel giddy drunk.

85
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,011
My two most perfect students together.

86
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,848
Oh, my goodness.
We gotta get this thing started.

87
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,726
I'm such a big fan.

88
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,354
I know that sounds ridiculous,
but I've downloaded all of your music

89
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,191
and that <i>New York Times</i> magazine profile
last month of you,

90
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,943
those photos of you were amazing,
and the way...

91
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,529
I was nine when I first saw you perform.

92
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,824
You were 14 and everything I wanted to be.

93
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,283
My idol.

94
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,786
Please don`t be nervous
around me, Charlotte.

95
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,916
I'm just so happy to finally meet you.

96
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,573
Wanna know a secret?

97
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,662
The girl on the left is going to win.

98
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,831
She's brilliant.
Leaves the other two in the dust.

99
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,505
I agree, but that kind of takes
the drama out of it, doesn't it?

100
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,886
You want drama?

101
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,392
Watch that other girl's mother
in the blue dress.

102
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,397
And the guy in the gray slacks.

103
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,869
He's the father of the girl in the middle.

104
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,695
There's something going on between them.

105
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,863
They can't help themselves.

106
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,285
And right in front of their spouses.

107
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,453
Just watch.

108
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,957
I first noticed during semifinals.

109
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,043
It's kind of hilarious.

110
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,048
And... kind of hot.

111
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,219
Just watch.

112
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,369
Her hand...

113
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,519
I know I shouldn't spy, but...

114
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,731
that...

115
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,860
That gets me wet.

116
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,940
We've actually met once before.

117
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,734
We have?

118
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,280
It was the day you were leaving Bachoff.

119
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,160
Your mom had just had her stroke,
and you had all your bags packed, and...

120
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:49,166
I was just entering,
and I was nervous and excited, and...

121
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,167
I saw you.

122
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,756
My hero.

123
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,570
That was a long time ago.

124
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,242
Do you ever play anymore?

125
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,580
It took me a while after I left Bachoff.

126
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,915
Years to be honest, but now I...

127
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,459
love it.

128
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,669
- Because you're playing for yourself?
- Exactly.

129
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,379
All that time with Anton,

130
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,715
the practice,

131
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,468
the performances,
the pressure to be perfect.

132
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,094
- It was...
- I know.

133
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,641
Do you ever think about leaving?

134
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,060
Bachoff?

135
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,398
It's my family. I can never.

136
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,941
Never?

137
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,570
No, never.

138
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,450
And, anyway, the work.

139
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,536
This special work.

140
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,289
It's what's expected of us.

141
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,044
I don't miss hearing that.

142
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,341
Well, you'll be happy to know
I'm giving myself a little vacation.

143
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,718
First one in forever. Starting tomorrow.

144
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,053
- Amazing.
- I know.

145
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,723
I know I can actually... sleep in.

146
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,686
Not dream about notes or scales,
rest my hands.

147
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,105
Cause a little trouble.

148
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,900
Have more than one drink in an evening.

149
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,528
The baijiu is delicious.

150
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,738
That is what I've heard.

151
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,282
I better catch up.

152
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,519
Oh, Jesus!

153
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,960
Was it something he ate?

154
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,163
I hope it isn't linked
to what's happening down south.

155
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,506
What's happening down south?

156
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,678
Some sort of hemorrhagic fever
near the Hunan border.

157
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,180
Passed in the air.
Real contagion-like stuff.

158
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,228
We were just scouting in Hunan.

159
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,563
Oh, it can't be that.

160
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,898
I sure hope not.

161
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,067
You know how Anton likes to find his
protégés in remote places.

162
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,613
- Hunan, Cambodia...
- Minnesota.

163
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,780
Tampa.

164
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,909
Will you go dancing with me later?

165
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,203
Yes.

166
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,750
Good.

167
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,920
Lizzie, there you are.
Anton is asking for you.

168
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,629
Come.

169
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,555
Elizabeth.

170
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,141
Elizabeth. I was just telling
Geoffrey and Theis

171
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,393
that I was hoping
that we could convince you to play

172
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,480
one short piece, please.

173
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,194
Only if you can convince Charlotte
to play second cello with me.

174
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,238
- My goodness. Yes, please.
- No.

175
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,366
- No.
- No. no. no. We must.

176
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,118
No. Lizzie, Lizzie. I couldn't.

177
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,495
Perfect. Please.

178
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,372
Please! Yes, make it happen.

179
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,582
- My goodness.
- Cello duet number three?

180
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,875
Oh, yes, perfect.

181
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,359
- I know you still know it.
- It's a dream come true.

182
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,419
Lizzie...

183
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,090
Lizzie, I'm an amateur now.

184
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,094
You have been and always will be

185
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:13,347
the person who makes
my heart skip a beat when you play.

186
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,273
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

187
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:28,445
We are all about to witness
something extraordinary.

188
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,554
Have you ever been with a woman before?

189
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,683
I've never been with anyone before.

190
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,770
No one? Ever?

191
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,900
My mom got sick, I went home.

192
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,696
So, everything else just got put on hold.

193
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,994
So, I'm your first.

194
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,665
First and best.

195
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,478
I'm traveling out west tomorrow.

196
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,814
Come with me.

197
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,066
Really?

198
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,276
Yeah.

199
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,613
I'm doing it rough and tumble.

200
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,157
Small buses, weird towns.

201
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,826
As far away from first class as I can get.

202
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,455
Unplugged from everything and everyone.

203
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,627
I think we could have fun together.

204
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,338
I think we could, too.

205
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,766
I've never met anyone like you before.

206
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,480
I mean, we're so different.

207
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,400
And yet...

208
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,736
we're more alike than it may seem.

209
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,521
Good morning.

210
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,278
Good morning, you.

211
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,992
Are you as hungover as I am?

212
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,785
Pretty much, yeah.

213
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,539
I am out of practice
on the binge drinking.

214
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,625
That Chinese vodka is brutal.

215
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,210
Do you want some ibuprofen?

216
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,296
Please. God, yes.

217
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,049
My head is throbbing.

218
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,717
I need like 50 of them.

219
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,724
The pharmacy is open for business.

220
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,688
What is that? Hair of the dog?

221
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,398
It's the best cure.

222
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,609
We're on vacation, right?

223
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,996
You really don't speak any Mandarin?

224
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,457
Like, not even <i>ni hao?</i>

225
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,377
I can say <i>ni hao, </i>but what you just did,

226
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,170
buying bus tickets...

227
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,089
I mean, that would have taken me
three hours

228
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:06,093
and lots of manic hand gestures
and then desperate crying

229
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,388
and then probably we would have
ended up in South Korea.

230
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,392
Or you could have just used a bus
and a ticket emoji. It's the same thing.

231
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,519
Okay. Well, that is an excellent point.

232
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,563
Are you sure you're okay?

233
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,482
You look like you're struggling.

234
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,777
Honestly, I feel like shit.

235
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,987
Okay. Well, are you sure you want
to do this?

236
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,032
We can just go back to the hotel
for the day and order pay-per-view

237
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,659
and you can get your head right.

238
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,661
No, I only have two weeks.

239
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,413
I don't want to waste any of it.

240
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,750
Play through the pain.

241
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,002
Play through the pain.

242
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,130
Don't you wanna get some food
before we leave?

243
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,214
It might help.

244
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,382
Okay.

245
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,995
Worst idea in history?

246
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,876
All I need is for my stomach
to go haywire on that bus.

247
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,354
Should we just get the check
and pretend this never happened?

248
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,671
This is your moment.

249
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,507
You can bow out gracefully
and I'll never hold it against you.

250
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,343
Just go to the airport like we never met?

251
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,427
Exactly.

252
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,806
Lizzie. Lizzie who?

253
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,851
I have no idea who you're talking about.

254
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,769
Don't make me laugh.

255
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,154
Are you sure you wanna do this?

256
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,282
I'm fine. I just need to sit down.

257
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,544
- Oh, God.
- What?

258
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,755
- Nothing.
- What?

259
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,965
- There was a bug.
- Jesus.

260
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,927
Yeah, this bus hasn't been cleaned
since maybe ever.

261
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,678
Well, I told you it was gonna be...

262
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,931
Rough and tumble. You weren't kidding.

263
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,144
There's like a fire in my head.
It's so crazy.

264
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,229
Do you want some water?

265
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,646
Yeah.

266
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,731
Here you go.

267
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,874
Oh, fuck.

268
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,294
It's like my mouth
has never been so fucking dry.

269
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,589
I need another ibuprofen.

270
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,591
Okay.

271
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,469
I'll be better after a few of these,
I swear.

272
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,387
Thank you.

273
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,267
No, no, no. That's too many.
Is that a good idea on an empty stomach?

274
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,072
This is good. I'll be... I'll be good now.

275
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,534
I'll be good. I'll be good.

00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:32,983
Charlotte.

299
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,573
I need to use the bathroom.

300
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,077
My stomach is a mess.

301
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,452
My head is even worse.

302
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,331
I don't know what's going on.
I just need to use the bathroom.

303
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,390
We're in the middle of nowhere.

304
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,631
I just need to use the bathroom.

305
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,675
You have to ask the bus driver to stop.

306
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,986
- Yeah, but I don't speak...
- Please, Charlotte.

307
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,512
I'm gonna be sick. Please just do it.

308
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,764
I feel like my stomach is gonna explode.

309
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:03,890
Okay.

310
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,601
Okay. Excuse me.

311
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,521
Uh, I don't...

312
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,107
Uh... Can anyone help me?

313
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,525
My friend is sick.

314
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,152
Does anyone speak English, please?

315
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,738
Sir, sir?

316
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,532
Excuse me. My friend is sick.

317
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,033
Can you please stop the bus?

318
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,996
Sir, can you stop the bus
so she can go to the bathroom?

319
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,125
Sir, can you please stop the bus?

320
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,752
Excuse me? Can anyone help me?

321
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,754
- She is sick?
- Yes, she's very sick. We...

322
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,478
- Your friend?
- Yeah, we need a bathroom.

323
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,931
It hurts so much.

324
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,517
You okay?

325
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,316
It's okay.

326
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,485
- I don't feel good.
- Okay.

327
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,279
Lizzie, we're gonna stop. I promise.

328
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,740
Stop. You have to pull over.

329
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,617
- I really don't feel good.
- I know. I know you don't.

330
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,744
We're gonna stop.

331
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,328
I'm gonna shit myself.

332
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,621
Okay, we're going to stop.

333
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,498
Sir, stop the fucking bus!

334
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,419
I can't hold it, please.

335
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,822
I know honey, I know.

336
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,880
I'm gonna shit myself.

337
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,548
I know. Hey. Hey!

338
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,259
Pull over the fucking bus. Do it!

339
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,893
Oh, fuck.

340
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,936
Okay. Here you go. Come on.

341
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,730
He stopped. Come on.

342
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,858
I can't. I can't move.
If I move, I'll shit.

343
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,027
You can do it.

344
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,738
Tiny steps, deep breath.

345
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,507
- My stomach is ripping apart.
- You can do this.

346
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,408
It hurts so bad, it hurts so bad.

347
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,993
I know, you can do it. Come on.

348
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,179
- I can't hold it.
- So close.

349
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,121
- I can't hold it.
- You can make it.

350
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,706
Oh, fuck, I'm gonna shit on the bus.

351
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,374
A few more steps. You're so close.

352
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,043
I'm sure that I can't hold it.

353
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,670
- I can't hold it, I'm gonna shit.
- Come on. You can do it.

354
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,671
You can do this.

355
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,259
I'm dying.

356
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,054
- It's okay.
- No, I'm dying.

357
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,932
- It's okay.
- I'm scared, Charlotte.

358
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,767
- It's okay.
- This is not normal.

359
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,647
What is happening?

360
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,524
What is happening to me?

361
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,485
- I don't know.
- What is happening to me?

362
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,861
I don't know. You're sick.

363
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,632
- You're sick and you'll feel better...
- Feels like my brain is on fire!

364
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,258
It's out of your system,
and it'll be okay.

365
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:29,077
You have no idea of the pain.
It just hurts so bad. Please.

366
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,122
Thank you.

367
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,961
- What is happening?
- Hey, you're okay.

368
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,133
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

369
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,344
I took care of my mom for years.
I can handle this.

370
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,307
She is sick!

371
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,433
You son of a bitch!

372
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,728
Can't you see that she's sick?
She's fucking sick!

373
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:00,942
Bad ass.

374
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,621
Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.

375
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,323
It's okay.

376
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,584
I'm sorry.

377
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,752
I'm so sorry.

378
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,754
I'm sorry.

379
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,340
I'm so sorry.

380
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,306
Take it so they're not freaked out.

381
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,640
Not because you need it.

382
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,819
Okay. Here you go.

383
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,325
So thirsty. I'm so thirsty.

384
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,076
Yeah, you're dehydrated.

385
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,913
Uh, water? Does anyone have any water?

386
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,831
Water? Anyone?

387
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,416
Water?

388
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,086
Oh. Thank you.

389
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,380
Thank you. Okay.

390
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,220
We have to get you to the doctor.

391
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,514
We have to get her to a hospital.
Hospital.

392
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,682
Is there one on the way?

393
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,977
I don't think so. Not until Tongli.
Not a hospital at least.

394
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,107
Can we call someone?

395
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,609
Can we call someone?

396
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,737
- Shit.
- Charlotte.

397
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,447
- There's no service.
- Charlotte.

398
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,615
Um...

399
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,367
- Charlotte?
- Yeah?

400
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,036
You have to help me.

401
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,955
It's gonna be okay.

402
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,539
I don't feel good.

403
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,375
- I know.
- I really don't feel good.

404
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,877
- My head, the pain is killing me.
- Okay.

405
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,089
It hurts so bad,
it feels like my brain is on fire

406
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,383
and it hurts.
I don't know what's happening to me.

407
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,136
- Try to close your eyes maybe.
- No, no. I don't why, it won't stop.

408
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,973
It won't stop.
I just need you to help me make it stop.

409
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,016
Okay. We're going to play a game.

410
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,476
We're going to play a game.

411
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,353
I need you to close your eyes.
Hey, hey, hey.

412
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,897
Close your eyes. Breathe. Breathe.

413
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,692
We are gonna list
as many composers as we can

414
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,610
in alphabetical order.

415
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,237
- Please don't...
- Lizzie?

416
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,948
- It hurts. It hurts.
- Okay? Ready?

417
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,031
I'll start.

418
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,616
Adams.

419
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,620
Come on, give me a "B."

420
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,081
Concentrate on that instead of the pain.

421
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,876
Beet... Beethoven.

422
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,545
Chopin.

423
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,797
Come on. You can do this.

424
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,383
Dvorak, Dvorak.

425
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,140
Good.

426
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,815
Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm gonna puke.

427
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,360
- What?
- Oh, God, please. Please.

428
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,368
Oh, God!

429
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,246
Are those b...?

430
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,876
Are those bugs? Are those fucking bugs?

431
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,930
Charlotte. Charlotte.

432
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,558
This isn't normal.
This isn't fucking normal!

433
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,267
Oh, God.

434
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,604
What if... What if that guy last night...

435
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,887
What if he had that Ebola thing
they were talking about?

436
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,442
What if he had it, the one from Hunan?

437
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,526
What if I caught it?

438
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,337
- No. You didn't catch that.
- What if I did?

439
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,739
- You didn't!
- What if I did? Look what's happening.

440
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,718
- What if I did?
- You didn't catch it, you didn't.

441
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,285
Oh, God. I'm gonna fucking die.

442
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,055
- No. Hey, hey, hey.
- I'm gonna fucking die.

443
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,663
Lizzie, you have to sit down.

444
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,707
- I'm sick.
- No, you're dehydrated.

445
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,168
I'm fucking sick.
What if I'm fucking sick?

446
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,587
What if you're sick, too?

447
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,174
They said it was contagious.
What if you have it too?

448
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,057
- I'm not sick.
- Oh, my God. What if you are?

449
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,260
I'm not sick. It'll be okay.

450
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,388
It's not something.
It is not gonna be fucking okay!

451
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,472
Stop saying it!

452
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,771
What are you doing?

453
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:08,940
What are you doing?

454
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,863
- Whoa. Stop!
- There's something inside of me.

455
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,111
No, no. There's nothing inside of you.

456
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,362
Yes, there is. You saw.

457
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,548
- There were fucking maggots in my puke.
- Well, the...

458
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,032
They're fucking inside of me.

459
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,368
They're crawling in my skin,
I can feel them.

460
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,369
No, there's not.

461
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,652
There's nothing inside of you.

462
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:26,165
I can feel them. They're in my head
and they won't get out.

463
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,084
Make them get out. Make them get out.

464
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,629
Oh, God!
It's crawling in my skin, I can feel it!

465
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,341
I can feel it.
It's in my head. Make it stop!

466
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,884
Please! It hurts!

467
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,761
- Get out! Get out of my body!
- Lizzie!

468
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,640
You have to make it stop.
I want it to stop!

469
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,562
- What is he saying?
- He says you have to get off.

470
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,606
Get off? We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

471
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,485
You can't kick us off this bus.

472
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,406
We need a doctor!
We need a fucking doctor!

473
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,741
You have to help us find a doctor.

474
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,162
My head, it's killing me.

475
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,496
Lizzie, stop!

476
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,833
What are you doing? Stop! No! Stop!

477
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,424
Look, we'll get help for you
when we reach Tongli.

478
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,592
I need it now.

479
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,470
That way is a small town.

480
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,680
They'll have a pharmacy, a doctor maybe.

481
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,764
Start walking there.

482
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,849
Fuck you!

483
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,934
You okay?

484
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,479
Thank you.

485
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,357
Okay. Okay. Are you okay?

486
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,819
Hey! We're in the middle of nowhere.
What are you doing?

487
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,364
No! No!

488
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,617
No! Fuck you!

489
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,621
Please come back. Wait!

490
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,873
Wait!

491
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,684
Here we go. Almost there.

492
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,977
Just keep going.

493
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,397
I'm burning up.

494
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,316
They're fucking inside of me.

495
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,569
Fucking crawling inside of me.
What is happening?

496
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,030
- It's gonna be okay, it's...
- No, it's not.

497
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,657
Ah, God, it's not.

498
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,201
It's not gonna be okay, Charlotte.
You need to leave me.

499
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,288
- I'm not going to leave you, Lizzie.
- No, Charlotte. Listen to me.

500
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,747
Something is wrong.

501
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,833
Something is wrong with me!

502
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,916
Lizzie, I know,
that's why we need to get you help.

503
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,600
No. I'm dying. Don't you understand that?

504
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,340
- No! I don't understand that.
- But I am. I'm dying.

505
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,386
It's inside of me.

506
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,680
It's fucking inside of me.

507
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,074
Charlotte?

508
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,329
Charlotte?

509
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,706
What's happening?

510
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,170
What's happening?

511
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,879
Oh, my God.

512
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,505
Your arm!

513
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,134
There's something crawling inside it.

514
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,470
What is it?

515
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,763
I don't know!

516
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,848
- What's happening?
- I don't fucking know!

517
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,559
Look, it's alive. These are fucking alive!

518
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:14,518
It's bugs!

519
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,312
They're fucking bugs!

520
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,690
What the fuck?

521
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,237
What the fuck is inside of you?

522
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,948
- Oh, my God.
- Your hand.

523
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:32,620
They're in your hand.
You have to get them out, Lizzie.

524
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,455
Lizzie, you have to stop it.

525
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,749
It's inside of you. You have to stop it.

526
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:40,461
- They're fucking inside of you!
- Oh, my God. Charlotte, help me.

527
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,130
Help me! Help me, Charlotte!

528
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,673
You know what you have to do.

529
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,153
You know what you have to do.

530
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,682
Good morning.

531
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,562
Good morning, you.

532
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,608
Are you as hungover as I am?

533
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,527
Pretty much. Yeah.

534
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,322
I am out of practice
on the binge drinking.

535
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,451
That Chinese vodka is brutal.

536
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,202
Do you want some ibuprofen?

537
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,966
Pharmacy is open for business.

538
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,676
What is that? Hair of the dog?

539
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,596
It's the best cure.

540
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,097
We're on vacation, right?

541
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,116
Oh, God.

542
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,784
- What?
- Nothing.

543
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,787
- What?
- There was a bug.

544
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,665
- I need another ibuprofen.
- Okay.

545
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,893
We have to get her to a hospital now.

546
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,394
Maybe we can call someone.

547
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,563
Shit.

548
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,607
There's no service.

549
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,485
Oh, God. Oh, God, I'm gonna puke.

550
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:11,987
Are those b...?

551
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,908
Are those bugs? Are those fucking bugs?

552
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,620
What's happening?

553
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,666
Oh, my God! Your arm!

554
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,919
There's something crawling inside me.

555
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,004
It's bugs! Bugs!

556
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,425
What the fuck?

557
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,761
They're in your hand.

558
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,304
They're all in your hand!

559
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,848
You know what you have to do.

560
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,622
I know it's a very long way from China,

561
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:48,334
but we are so thrilled to have Zhang Li
come live with us and study cello.

562
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,169
The joy is for us, Ms. Paloma.

563
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,838
It's every dream I ever had for her.

564
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:56,717
We will take the very best care of her,
as if she was our own daughter.

565
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,972
Now, Zhang Li, are you ready to go down
and see the Chapel?

566
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,056
Yes.

567
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,394
The day students you study with
are unlikely to ever see this.

568
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,814
Spectacular, isn't it?

569
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,818
Converted from a chapel
nearly a hundred years ago.

570
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,781
Based on the Musikverein in Vienna.

571
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,284
Zhang Li, come here. Come up here.

572
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:25,954
Come on. Come.

573
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,916
Okay, now stand right here.

574
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,209
Right here.

575
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,878
And I want you to sing a note.

576
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,963
Hm. A sharp.

577
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,339
Hm.

578
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,052
Sing.

579
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,852
Doesn't that sound incredible?

580
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,107
I believe this to be the most...

581
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,402
acoustically perfect room
I've ever been in.

582
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,570
- It's beautiful.
- And...

583
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,447
very few students

584
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,075
are invited to play here.

585
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:07,371
It takes years and years
of intense practice.

586
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,664
But the best,

587
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,541
the very best,

588
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,042
Lizzie, for example,

589
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,753
Charlotte Willmore, before her.

590
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,298
If you are as exceptional

591
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:22,720
as they are, and Zhang Li,
I believe you may be,

592
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:26,181
well, then you can have the chance
to perform here

593
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,517
and then you can have the chance...

594
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,978
for greatness.

595
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,431
Hello.

596
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,022
Hello, who is it?

597
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,613
Who is it, please?

598
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,574
Hello.

599
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:29,952
Who is it?

600
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,629
Oh, my God.

601
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,673
Where have you been?

602
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:45,385
What's... What's happened to you?
We've been looking for you.

603
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,472
Elizabeth.

604
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,018
What happened to your hand?

605
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,443
What the hell happened to your hand?

606
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,197
They found me on the side of a mountain.

607
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,033
Drugged out of my mind.

608
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,994
Covered in blood.

609
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,166
With nothing but a homemade tourniquet
keeping me alive.

610
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,838
The police tried to help me, but...

611
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,967
I'm the one who took the pills.

612
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,094
I'm the one who...

613
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,388
chopped my own hand off.

614
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,475
Once I woke up in the hospital, and...

615
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:38,105
once the drugs were out of my system,
and I could think clearly again...

616
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,109
Charlotte was already out of the country.

617
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,069
I still can't understand.

618
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,154
Why? Why would she do this?

619
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,073
Because...

620
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,702
Because she's a jealous fucking bitch!

621
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,413
I had...

622
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,583
music, fame...

623
00:47:58,792 --> 00:47:59,793
you.

624
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,129
And she couldn't stand that.

625
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,673
She couldn't stand
that I replaced her. She...

626
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,427
tracked me down to China, befriended me,

627
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,388
slept with me, poisoned me.

628
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:15,183
All that because I had the life
that she so desperately wanted.

629
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,852
My God. God.

630
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,730
And now it's gone. It is...

631
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,940
It is completely gone.

632
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,942
Elizabeth, it's...

633
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,694
It's going to be okay.

634
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,863
She took everything from me.

635
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,532
Everything!

636
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

637
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,625
More tension.

638
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:23,876
Yes.

639
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,089
Good. Good.

640
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,174
Play through the pain. Good.

641
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:38,766
Right.

642
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,601
Don't...

643
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,909
Actually, Elizabeth,
when practice is over,

644
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,786
do you have a minute to talk?

645
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,460
I don't understand.

646
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,755
You're kicking me out?

647
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,717
I have nowhere to go.

648
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,176
We found you a place.

649
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,054
By the museum,
right next to Central Avenue T Station.

650
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,139
We'll pay for it.

651
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:19,391
Pay for all of it.
Pay for your rehabilitation.

652
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:22,352
But I can still be useful, Anton.
I can teach.

653
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,605
Music is my life.

654
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,690
Look at us.

655
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,775
You know what this is.

656
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,028
How we work here.

657
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,696
We have Theis and Geoffrey.

658
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,698
We don't need any more teachers.

659
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,075
But I can conduct, and I can compose.

660
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,319
Fuck, I'll scrub the toilets!

661
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,454
Just don't... Don't shut me out.

662
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,373
Please.

663
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,250
Anton...

664
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,753
if you accept me,

665
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,796
the music world will accept me.

666
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,132
Don't you understand that?

667
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,885
You have that power.

668
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,762
You have that reputation.

669
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,222
Your word means so much,

670
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,641
but if you shut me out...

671
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,227
Please.

672
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,314
Please.

673
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,233
Don't be this person.

674
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,028
Do not discard me.

675
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:16,573
Lizzie, this is a music conservatory,
not a convalescent home.

676
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,286
I'm sorry.

677
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,872
I didn't mean it like that,

678
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,583
but there are other girls
that we need to house and train.

679
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,379
Anton...

680
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:34,674
Please.

681
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,678
I don't know anything else.

682
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,057
You had a gift.

683
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,393
A rare and...

684
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:49,272
beautiful talent like no other.

685
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,360
But sadly, that gift is gone.

686
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,073
I'm so sorry, Elizabeth.

687
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,579
Please.

688
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,453
Hello?

689
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,915
Fuck you. Crazy bitch!

690
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,751
Fuck you! Fuck you!

691
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,546
Fuck you. You fucking bitch!

692
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,078
Anton.

693
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:35,999
What's going on?

694
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:42,922
Anton.

695
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,006
Stay here.

696
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,553
Lizzie.

697
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,474
What are you doing here?

698
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,726
You're gonna freeze to death.

699
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:01,441
Look, I know this is hard,
but I thought I made myself clear.

700
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,984
You just can't be here.

701
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,362
Because I had nothing you wanted.

702
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:07,655
Now I do.

703
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,866
What are you talking about?

704
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,660
What do you have?

705
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,790
I have the bitch.

706
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,502
Oh, my God.

707
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,047
Lizzie, what have you done?

708
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,173
Where is she?

709
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:29,803
Where is she?

710
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,682
In the trunk of my fucking car.

711
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,732
So I can come home?

712
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,787
Where is she?

713
00:56:57,622 --> 00:57:00,041
She's with Paloma, but don't worry.

714
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,419
She... She can't hurt you.

715
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:03,837
But she's crazy.

716
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,005
She kidnapped me, Anton.

717
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,049
I know. She's not well. Clearly.

718
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:10,760
But frankly,

719
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:12,971
neither are you.

720
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,100
Were you really that jealous?

721
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,477
I wasn't jealous.

722
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,564
I was trying to help her.

723
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,733
By cutting off her hand?

724
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,531
I saw her picture in a magazine.

725
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,700
I saw the tattoo on her back.

726
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:35,910
The same as mine.

727
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,622
I knew how she got it.

728
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:44,043
I knew what she had to do to get it.

729
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,964
And I knew she was brainwashed
just like I was

730
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,925
until my mom got sick
and I had to go home.

731
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:56,556
<i>I sat in that room with my mother
for a decade, slowly going crazy.</i>

732
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,142
<i>I blamed myself for everything.</i>

733
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:03,730
<i>I spent years in and out of
mental hospitals until, finally,</i>

734
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,899
<i>with some help, I saw the light.</i>

735
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,527
So I reached out...

736
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,822
and came back into your lives.

737
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,744
Came back why?

738
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,041
Came back why, Charlotte?

739
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,751
To help save her.

740
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,753
Save her from what?

741
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,048
From you.

742
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,045
Very good.

743
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,131
Very good.

744
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,677
Back straight now.

745
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:18,805
Excellent.

746
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,766
More tension in the strings.

747
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,271
Feel it happening inside of you,
Charlotte.

748
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:29,481
Mm-hmm.

749
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,816
Yes.

750
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:32,776
Good.

751
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,497
I made a mistake.

752
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,582
Yes, you did.

753
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,835
I'm sorry.

754
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,420
And after all this time.

755
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,171
- Forgive me.
- After all this training.

756
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,464
Forgive me, Anton.

757
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,925
After a promise for Carnegie Hall.

758
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,889
Stop. Stop the crying.

759
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,643
Ouch.

760
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,354
Stop the fucking crying!

761
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,148
It won't happen again.

762
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:12,275
In this room, it had better not.

763
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,484
Never in this room.

764
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,069
Because you know what happens next.

765
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,779
- Yes, I do.
- Do you?

766
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,155
Yes.

767
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,787
We don't make mistakes here.

768
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,208
Not when we represent the Academy.

769
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,678
Whose name is on that gate?

770
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,765
- Yours.
- Yes.

771
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:47,226
Mine, my father's, grandfather's.

772
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,187
This school is my blood.

773
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:50,855
It's my history.

774
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:55,485
I teach you the way they taught me,
the way they taught Theis and Geoffrey,

775
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:59,614
and anyone who's fortunate enough
to earn their place here.

776
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,741
But I can only take you so far.

777
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:02,950
I will work harder.

778
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,995
Oh, you will work harder.

779
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,499
Why do we work so hard, Charlotte?

780
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,667
To be the best.

781
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,252
And why is that, Charlotte?

782
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,007
Because it's what's expected of us.

783
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,100
You got that tattoo because

784
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:31,813
you were ready to play in this Chapel.

785
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,273
You got that tattoo...

786
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,651
because you were the very best.

787
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,527
Yes, I know.

788
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,196
And If you're not the very best,

789
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:42,323
if you insult me...

790
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,743
and Theis and Geoffrey with your mistakes?

791
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:48,246
I discredit the Academy.

792
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:50,914
Why?

793
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:56,087
Because I was prepared for
The Perfection and failed.

794
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:02,343
Prepared by our sweat,
passion, and reputation.

795
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:06,139
Prepared by our sweat and passion
and reputation.

796
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,349
Month after month, year after year.

797
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,895
Month after month, year after year.

798
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,522
Until you were ready.

799
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,276
Until I was ready.

800
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,674
You failed.

801
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,468
You failed.

802
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,431
So what does that mean?

803
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,684
What does that mean, Charlotte?

804
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,855
When you fail
at the things that we teach you?

805
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:59,025
I cannot get close to God.

806
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,027
No, you cannot.

807
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,488
And your talent will lay in waste.

808
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:06,407
Squandered by your lack of ambition.

809
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,743
So what happens now?

810
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,287
- Now?
- Yes, what happens now?

811
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:14,165
What happened to me,
what happened to Theis and Geoffrey?

812
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:18,127
And every one of the chosen who failed?

813
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,217
We pay the price.

814
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,851
You pay the price.

815
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:46,048
Tonight, Charlotte, after so many years,

816
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:48,593
you shall play for us again.

817
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:51,888
I can't.

818
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:56,017
- I'm not ready.
- Sonata for solo cello.

819
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,227
I'm not ready to play here, Anton.

820
01:04:58,811 --> 01:04:59,979
Please.

821
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:03,649
Well, here is where you must play.
Where you've always played.

822
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,068
Theis, Geoffrey.

823
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,152
No.

824
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,370
And, of course, Paloma.

825
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,457
Please.

826
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:23,210
Paloma, you can stop this.

827
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:24,962
Please.

828
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:27,340
We do what we need to do, Charlotte.

829
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:30,009
It's what's expected of us.

830
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:36,015
Paloma's always adored
when you played perfectly. Well..

831
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,475
we all did.

832
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,019
That was always the goal.

833
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,103
Right, Charlotte?

834
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,481
The Perfection.

835
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:47,652
This doesn't have to be like this, Anton.

836
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,449
You really hate me, don't you?

837
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:55,826
You...

838
01:05:55,910 --> 01:06:00,039
you hate me,
when all I ever did was believe in you.

839
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,541
You know what you did to me.

840
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,002
And you know it helped you become

841
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,129
the rare talent that you were.

842
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,923
I was a child.

843
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,842
Lizzie was a child. We were children.

844
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:14,637
You were students who achieved greatness.

845
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:17,348
Just as my grandfather envisioned.

846
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:19,684
Just like my father taught me.

847
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,354
Everybody should be so lucky.

848
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:25,814
Lizzie.

849
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,150
Were you abused?

850
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,696
Is that what you would call it,
what we did for you?

851
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:39,954
To play that music,

852
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,290
to achieve The Perfection...

853
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,380
it was a gift.

854
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:56,387
You see, Charlotte?

855
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,598
You cut off her hand for nothing.

856
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:02,435
Lizzie, if you would.

857
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:08,431
Well, you must remember our...

858
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:12,278
little rituals. The drinks, the formality.

859
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,156
Consequences.

860
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,160
Oh, but you were just a child then.

861
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:22,621
Most things really have not changed.

862
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,373
Well, actually...

863
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,084
there is one thing that has changed.

864
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,380
If you achieve The Perfection,

865
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,967
which is what's expected
of you this evening, then...

866
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,970
you can go.

867
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,932
I'm a taskmaster, yes, but...

868
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,643
I'm not a monster.

869
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,606
But if you should make a mistake,

870
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,609
if you miss one minor note...

871
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,821
well, it won't be you who pays the price.

872
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,908
Paloma, if you would.

873
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,873
We're ready for you, sweetheart. Come.

874
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:07,499
Ah.

875
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:12,713
Zhang Li, you are a very lucky girl.

876
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,840
Come, come, come. Sit.

877
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:18,677
To be able to witness
this private concert,

878
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,846
you are so, so lucky.

879
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,432
Thank you so much.

880
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,060
No.

881
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:30,272
Okay, Charlotte.
It's time for you to play.

882
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:32,524
I can't.

883
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,947
Ah. If you can't,
you know what will happen.

884
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,367
She just got here.

885
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:43,326
She's a child.

886
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:45,412
Do it to me.

887
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:51,544
If you have to do it, do it to me, please.
Don't do it to her.

888
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,504
Anton, please, I'm begging you.

889
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:54,630
Stop!

890
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:58,634
Do it to me.

891
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,512
Play for us, Charlotte.

892
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,223
We're gathered to hear you play.

893
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:06,559
Now do it.

894
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,356
Play The Perfection.

895
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:19,571
Play.

896
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,011
Well, you know what happens now.

897
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:56,770
Paloma, would you be so kind
as to bring Zhang Li upstairs?

898
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,147
It's past her bedtime.

899
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,365
Thank you. It was wonderful.

900
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:23,339
Did you really think
I was going to make her pay...

901
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:25,466
for your mistake?

902
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:29,636
She needs her years of training.

903
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,680
She needs to be invited...

904
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:36,477
to perform for us, as a vessel of God.

905
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,562
She needs her tattoo.

906
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:42,399
I'm not some random pervert.

907
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:45,986
Just having a little fun.

908
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,074
You motherfucker.

909
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:57,998
Theis, Geoffrey.

910
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:01,293
Come get me when she stops biting.

911
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,856
Help!

912
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:29,321
Oh, no, no.

913
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,782
Please help me!

914
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:35,368
No!

915
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,286
Wait!

916
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,496
No.

917
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,705
I want her first.

918
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:41,500
It's the least I deserve.

919
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,128
Please. No, no.

920
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,172
Can anybody hear me?

921
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:50,801
Usually I like to use my fingers, but...

922
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:52,344
No!

923
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,188
That's out the question now,
don't you think?

924
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:56,682
No!

925
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:57,766
Spread her legs.

926
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,059
Don't touch me!

927
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:04,565
Please, no.

928
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:06,608
This won't hurt as bad as...

929
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:09,111
cutting your own hand off, but...

930
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,321
I'll do my best to come close.

931
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,409
- Please!
- Hope your cunt can handle it.

932
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,871
No.

933
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,330
No!

934
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:22,958
No!

935
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,918
No!

936
01:15:28,732 --> 01:15:30,025
Fuck you! Fuck you!

937
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,622
I should fucking kill you.

938
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:54,925
But you were right.

939
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:11,858
What you said...

940
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:14,653
on the side of the road.

941
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:18,198
You were right.

942
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:27,249
My hand!

943
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:29,543
My hand.

944
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,587
I had to save you.

945
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:36,592
I had to get you out of his grasp.

946
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:37,759
I knew you were in deep.

947
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:41,346
As deep as I once was, and I knew you
weren't gonna leave without a fight.

948
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,599
I can't believe this is happening.

949
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:45,892
I knew you were
one of his special students.

950
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:50,896
What?

951
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:52,774
You don't know anything.

952
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:54,401
I do.

953
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:56,737
That's why I had to save you.

954
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:58,363
Stop saying that.

955
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,992
You didn't save me.
You didn't save me from anything.

956
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:04,077
You made me chop off my own hand.

957
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,704
If you weren't gonna escape willingly,

958
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:10,000
then I had to come up with a true reason
that he would never need to see you again.

959
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:12,002
That he would never need you again.

960
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:16,506
Because just know, Lizzie,
he never loved you.

961
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:19,718
He never loved me.
He never gave a shit about any of us.

962
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:22,596
They tortured us
and pretended it was an education.

963
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:24,973
Pretended it was
some kind of higher calling,

964
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:27,559
but it was just rape, Lizzie.

965
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,354
They raped me, and they raped you.

966
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:34,232
And the next time you need Anton most,
he will not be there for you.

967
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,568
I promise you that, but I will be.

968
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:38,570
I will be there.

969
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:44,576
I promise.

970
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,877
I'm so sorry.

971
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,175
I keep seeing him.

972
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,097
All of them, abusing me.

973
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:09,726
For years, years, over and over.

974
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,230
Like I never saw it before.

975
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:17,484
Like I was blind.

976
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:24,491
It look <i>this </i>happening
for me to fucking see it.

977
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:31,623
I have to stop Anton.

978
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:35,627
We have to stop all of them.

979
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,674
I need your help.

980
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:45,303
Anything.

981
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,101
Anton.

982
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:35,187

983
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:39,815
Hm?

984
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,488
