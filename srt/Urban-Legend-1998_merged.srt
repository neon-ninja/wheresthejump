1
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,151
You're listening
to "Under the Covers" with Sasha...

2
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,882
on WZAB, the voice
of Pendleton University.

3
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,516
- We're still talking to-
- Jane.

4
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,719
Sophomore. Hi.

5
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,058
So, you've been stealing
your roommate's birth control pills?

6
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,722
Borrowing, okay?

7
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,564
She never noticed before 'cause I've
always replaced them with baby aspirin.

8
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,469
- With what?
- Baby aspirin. Looks exactly the same.

9
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,372
Anyway, so now she's pregnant
and has to leave school.

10
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,967
How am I gonna get a new roommate
this late in the semester?

11
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,049
Oh, my God!

12
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,053
Next caller.

13
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,474
Oh, no.

14
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,715
Shit.

15
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,152
Okay, please make it.

16
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

17
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,766
Run outta gas?

18
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,499
Yeah. Fill it up, please.

19
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,773
Freak show.

20
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,792
Miss, could you come inside...

21
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,962
for a minute?

22
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,562
- Please!
- What is it?

23
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:47,406
Your credit card company's
on the phone.

24
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,448
Is there a problem?

25
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,449
They wanna...

26
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,008
speak with you.

27
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,980
Okay, hold on a minute.

28
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,987
Shit.

29
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,621
Hello?

30
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,026
No, don't touch me!

31
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,633
Let me go!

32
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,831
Stop!

33
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:36,354
Someone's in the back seat!

34
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,573
You're "Under the Covers"
with Sasha on WZAB...

35
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,116
the voice of Pendleton University.

36
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,617
Caller.

37
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,277
Hello?

38
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,449
I'm right here.

39
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,889
Felicia, how can I help you?

40
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,156
Well, it's kind of embarrassing.

41
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,163
Spit it out.

42
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:56,099
Well, that's just the problem.
I mean, I didn't.

43
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,798
Had yourself a little
frat boy protein shake, did ya?

44
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,034
I've been feeling so sick.

45
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,043
I swear, I can feel them
swimming inside me.

46
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,579
Should I get my stomach pumped
or something?

47
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,515
I think the only thing you need pumped
is the air out of your head.

48
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,680
First, let me just congratulate you
on your choice of sexual activity...

49
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:19,384
because, sweetie, the world
is not ready for you to reproduce.

50
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,222
Second, did you know that ingestion
of bodily fluids...

51
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,229
is a major safe sex no-no?

52
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,559
- Really?
- Really.

53
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,964
My suggestion is that you down
a couple shots of Pepto...

54
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,698
and next time, get away
from the volcano before it erupts.

55
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:37,038
That wraps up another night.
This is Sasha signing off on WZAB.

56
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,772
Parker, how exactly does Sasha
come up with this stuff?

57
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,713
She devours every issue of "Cosmo. "

58
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,410
- Calls it her Bible.
- Thank you.

59
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,051
Finish the story
about Stanley Hall.

60
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,715
Right.

61
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,460
So, this guy...

62
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,692
he was a professor on campus,
maybe 25 years ago.

63
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,255
What did he teach?

64
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,894
I don't know.
Physics or some shit.

65
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,268
Abnormal psychology.

66
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,330
You know, if you wanna tell
the story right-

67
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,433
Not the point of the story,
paperboy!

68
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,978
But fine.
Abnormal psych it is.

69
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,707
Anyhoo...

70
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,875
this guy, he just flips out,
you know?

71
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,387
Goes completely berserk.
Grabs a hunting knife...

72
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,023
and he strolls into Stanley Hall.

73
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,525
Bangs on every door.

74
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:33,122
And every student
that answers their door...

75
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,191
he takes that little knife,
and he cuts their throat...

76
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,101
ear to ear.

77
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,140
Yeah. He does away
with an entire floor...

78
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,608
before finally stabbing himself...

79
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,441
straight through the heart.

80
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,573
And thus...

81
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,744
the annual Omega Sigma Phi bash.

82
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,648
So you have a frat party
to commemorate a massacre?

83
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:58,951
You betcha.

84
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,720
Let me get this straight.

85
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,819
When this happened 25 years ago...

86
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,592
you were a sophomore.

87
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,095
That's funny.

88
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,502
Well, it's a bullshit story you hear
on every campus in the northeast.

89
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,166
Thank you.
I mean, where's the proof?

90
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,403
You see, that's the thing.

91
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,002
Pendleton knew damn well
that enrollment...

92
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,775
would suffer permanently.

93
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:27,080
So, in cahoots with the national
news media and various other powerful-

94
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,415
Like Lee Harvey Oswald?

95
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,857
Or is it Jack Ruby?

96
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,391
No, I know who it was.

97
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,361
It was that F.B.I. guy who used to
prance around in women's underwear.

98
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,795
He covered it all up.

99
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,968
That's the news room.
I gotta go. Get a life.

100
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,473
- Hey, Paul!
- Yeah.

101
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,705
Before you go, if there's another
E. coli crisis in the cafeteria...

102
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,770
I want you to have
the biggest, juiciest burger on me.

103
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:59,807
I'd love to. That article
almost got me the student Pulitzer.

104
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,348
- Bye, Paul.
- Bye, Paul.

105
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,049
Know what his problem is?

106
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,058
He can't stand any big story...

107
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,060
without having his byline on it.

108
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,322
He is such a babe.

109
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,831
All right?

110
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,732
Did it seem like
he was giving me the eye?

111
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,895
It was probably
the mirror behind us.

112
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,472
Oh, damn.

113
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,135
Should I ask him out anyway?

114
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,972
If Parker's story is true
and all those kids were murdered here...

115
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,676
why haven't they torn down
Stanley Hall?

116
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,015
'Cause the story's not true.
It's just a legend.

117
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,520
If it's just a legend,
then what's the problem?

118
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,420
- I won't encourage this.
- Come on, Natalie.

119
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,857
Cut me a little slack. This is
half the reason I transferred here.

120
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:45,522
Now what exactly happens
when I say "Bloody Mary" five times?

121
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,932
The person standing next to you
wonders how you got into college.

122
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,596
- Come on.
- You're scared.

123
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,138
Yeah, right.

124
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,834
Then come on and let's do this.
Come on!

125
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,638
Time to raise the dead!

126
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,372
I can't believe this.

127
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:08,379
Bloody Mary.

128
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,665
Fine. No answer.

129
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,731
Maybe they're screening.

130
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,242
God.

131
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Let's go.

132
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,285
You called?

133
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,657
She was trying to summon
the dead, Damon...

134
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,425
not frat boys
with badly grown facial hair.

135
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,831
It took me a month to grow this.

136
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,529
So is this what you do
for your free time, Damon?

137
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,402
Hang out in the dark by yourself,
waiting to scare people like a freak.

138
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,374
Only when I see two losers
stand in front of this relic...

139
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,502
trying to summon the dead.

140
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,013
Anyhow, I'll see you two
in class tomorrow.

141
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,208
- Unfortunately!
- See ya.

142
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,716
Jerk.

143
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,187
You know, he was halfway normal
before pledge week.

144
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

145
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,261
Sorry.

146
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,819
Shut off the fucking light.

147
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,821
Sorry.

148
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:36,424
Last week, we discussed
folklore as a gauge...

149
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,164
for the values of the society
that created them.

150
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,433
Today-

151
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,532
Today, we get more specific.

152
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:52,441
A baby-sitter receives
menacing phone calls.

153
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,578
And upon investigating them...

154
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,680
she realizes that
they are originating...

155
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,691
from an upstairs bedroom...

156
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,458
the very room...

157
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,794
where she's left the children
under her care...

158
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,856
to sleep.

159
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,266
Now, who's heard this before?

160
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,807
Well, that really happened
to a girl in my hometown.

161
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,640
Oh, yes.
I'm sure it did.

162
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,204
I'm sure most of you...

163
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,250
grew up thinking
this did happen to girls...

164
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,909
in all your hometowns...

165
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,580
but it didn't.

166
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,590
You see, the baby-sitter...

167
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,421
and the man upstairs...

168
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,293
is what we call an urban legend.

169
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,721
Contemporary folklore...

170
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,233
passed on as a true story.

171
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,066
There are variations
of this one...

172
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,799
going back to the 1960s...

173
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:53,106
all of them containing
the same cultural admonition:

174
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,306
Young women, mind your children...

175
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,816
or harm will come your way.

176
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,583
Excuse me?

177
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,092
Something funny
you might care to share with us...

178
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,292
Ms.?

179
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,358
No, I was just saying, like...

180
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:21,167
maybe the cultural admonition is:
Don't baby-sit.

181
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,702
Why don't you come up here...

182
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,682
and volunteer
for my little experiment, hmm?

183
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,509
Yeah, that's a great idea.

184
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,554
Now, young lady!

185
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,691
- Coming.
- Yeah, baby.

186
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,489
Don't worry.
You'll probably survive.

187
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,666
- Had those before?
- Yeah, they're Pop Rocks.

188
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,169
They crackle in your mouth.

189
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,829
Eat some.

190
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,174
Thirsty?

191
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,511
Well, what's wrong?

192
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,750
Something you might have heard
about mixing Pop Rocks and soda?

193
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,190
Well, supposedly...

194
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,319
your stomach and your intestines,
everything bursts.

195
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,196
Really? Anyone you know
who died this way?

196
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,359
Mikey, from the cereal commercial.

197
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,460
Give it to Mikey.
He'll eat anything.

198
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,232
You mean him?

199
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,072
Mikey likes it.

200
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,115
What if I told you
that this is Mikey...

201
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,748
alive and well and working
as an ad executive in New York City?

202
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,758
Would you drink some then?

203
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,095
I'll do it.

204
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,208
Your soda.

205
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,385
Voila! Still alive.

206
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,793
As I said, class...

207
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:29,061
this story is nothing
but an urban legend.

208
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,969
Professor!

209
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,236
He's gonna explode!

210
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,447
Somebody call 911! Go!

211
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,097
Thank you for your help.

212
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,435
Brilliant. He's brilliant.

213
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,839
He is such a moron.

214
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,003
Yeah, but who fell for it?

215
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,680
Hey, what's going on?

216
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,013
Excuse me, young man.
Can't read these.

217
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,019
She just left the campus.

218
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,355
- She went to Pendleton?
- You have got to be kidding me.

219
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,622
I knew I should've gone to N.Y.U.

220
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:32,686
Tragic, huh?

221
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,024
Hi.

222
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,031
Is this true?

223
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,696
I certainly hope so.

224
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:44,139
Otherwise I'm gonna have
one hell of a retraction on my hands.

225
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,277
What do you think you're doin'?

226
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,716
You can't just come
and take every copy here.

227
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,982
You're the one that wrote
this inflammatory piece of rubbish.

228
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:00,991
Actually, the fatuous quotes about
being deeply shocked and heartsick...

229
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,253
are yours, Dean Adams.

230
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,158
Let me tell you something,
young man.

231
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,960
The only lunatic
on this campus is you.

232
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,560
I'm flattered.
Can I quote you on that?

233
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,303
I have a quote for ya.
"U.S. News and World Report"...

234
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,311
named Pendleton the safest university
in this country.

235
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,143
And you best believe,
I intend to keep it that way.

236
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,377
Thank you, Reese.
I'll make sure...

237
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,648
and stick that in the special
school safety edition.

238
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,712
Hold on a second.
How about some interviews, you know?

239
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,759
Students react to
the tragedy on campus.

240
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,919
I am saddened and moved by-

241
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,054
This was someone's life.

242
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,498
Did you even spend one minute
thinking about that?

243
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,728
No, I didn't.

244
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,931
But because of my story,
3,500 students will.

245
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,531
I think that's enough
to help me sleep at night.

246
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,871
Come on. Let's go.

247
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,944
The decapitated body
of 20-year-old...

248
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,142
Pendleton student, Michelle Mancini...

249
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,208
was found in her car.

250
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,187
Police suspect her assailant
was probably hiding in the back seat.

251
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,384
In the meantime, the search continues
for Michael McDonald...

252
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,690
the proprietor of this gas station
where she was last seen.

253
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:14,698
Police are asking anyone with
any information on his whereabouts...

254
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,233
to contact them immediately.

255
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,896
This is David McAree
reporting live.

256
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,529
That's horrible.

257
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:24,404
Someone told me that she was listening
to my show when it happened.

258
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,239
My voice was probably
the last thing she heard.

259
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,747
- Can you imagine?
- What if there is a lunatic on campus?

260
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,249
That's fine with me. I'm hitting the
half pipe at Kellington this weekend.

261
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,308
Did anyone here know her?

262
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,115
She roomed in Daley.

263
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,553
- No.
- No.

264
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,481
Hello?

265
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,892
Space cadet.

266
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,993
Oh, no, I didn't know her.

267
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:51,090
Actually, you know,
I did know her.

268
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,796
- You did?
- Yeah.

269
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,105
I'll miss her, too, 'cause...

270
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,005
that girl gave great head.

271
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,944
You get it?
She gave great head.

272
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,480
- Come on!
- That was good.

273
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,019
Hey, Tash.

274
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,688
- Sorry about last night.
- Yeah?

275
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,755
Well, don't let it happen again.

276
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,942
Here. You dropped these.

277
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,183
Excuse me?

278
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,154
This is my phone line too.

279
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:03,273
Hey, it's Brenda.
You seemed kind of weird this afternoon.

280
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,707
You okay, hon? Call me.

281
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,540
Natalie, it's Mom.

282
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,410
Listen, sweetie, I'm just calling
to make sure you're okay.

283
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,042
Isn't it horrible about Michelle?

284
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,553
Please call, okay?
I love you.

285
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,245
Hey! I was just
in the neighborhood.

286
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,258
Thought I'd drop by,
see if you wanted to go to the house.

287
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,385
Parker said he's gonna
pierce Hootie's nose.

288
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:57,792
Hootie's a dog.

289
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,229
Yeah, there's no reason
he can't be hip.

290
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:01,731
No, that's okay, Damon.

291
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,091
What's up? You all right?

292
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,727
Yeah, I'm fine.

293
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:09,638
Listen, we don't have to go hang out
with a bunch of drunken frat boys.

294
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,734
We could just
go someplace and talk.

295
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,374
I don't really want this
to get out around campus...

296
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,384
but I can actually be a pretty good
listener every once in a while.

297
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,630
- A little something to warm you up?
- Sure.

298
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,439
It's a slight process.

299
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,277
Oh, God.

300
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,553
So you and Michelle
were friends then?

301
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,530
Yeah.

302
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,191
So what happened?

303
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,827
I'd really rather not
talk about it anymore.

304
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,928
It's completely understandable.

305
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,439
If you don't want to open up,
that's fine.

306
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,904
I want you to know that...

307
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,243
I know exactly
what you're going through.

308
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,579
- You do?
- Sure.

309
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,686
I lost somebody close to me.

310
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,692
My girlfriend, she's-

311
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,192
- She's dead.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

312
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,200
No, it's okay.

313
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,734
She was sick for awhile.

314
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,069
She had...

315
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,165
a syndrome...

316
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,803
and after that...

317
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:00,315
I was afraid to get close to anybody
for a long time, but then...

318
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,444
it hit me, you know.

319
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,489
Why am I being so selfish?

320
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,685
I still have so much love
inside of me left to give.

321
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,921
- You do?
- Yeah, and Natalie...

322
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,055
you're in need of loving.

323
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,860
- I am?
- Yeah.

324
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,060
You're lonely.
You're repressed.

325
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,103
You're aching to break loose.

326
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,434
Those are the type of problems
that only a man can fix.

327
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:25,067
And, I suppose,
you're that man.

328
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,408
Well, you know-

329
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:35,478
Nice try. That was a fairly good
impersonation of a human being.

330
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,317
I understand, you're afraid.

331
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,551
But you don't
have to be afraid anymore.

332
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,923
You don't have to
be afraid to love.

333
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,460
Start the car right now.

334
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,055
Okay, that hurt. I'm just trying
to help you out here.

335
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,930
You don't have to act
like such a bitch.

336
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,935
It's not an act.
Believe me.

337
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,503
You sure you don't wanna
think this over?

338
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:59,065
'Cause I'm all about healing.

339
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,045
One black eye or two?
You decide.

340
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,546
All right, fine.

341
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,916
I'm gonna take a piss.
I'll be right back.

342
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:12,748
Pig.

343
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

344
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Shake it and let's go.

345
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,207
Come on!

346
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:18,038
Don't start the car.

347
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:29,178
This is the end of your rotten life,
you motherfuckin' dope pusher!

348
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,657
It was easy for him because he really
didn't believe it was coming.

349
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,793
But it ain't gonna be easy for you
'cause you better believe this coming.

350
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,336
Girl, what's wrong with you?

351
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,373
They killed him!
Somebody killed him!

352
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,701
It's right past this bridge.

353
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,973
I don't see nothing.

354
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,518
Are you sure this is it?

355
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,726
- I don't get it. The car was-
- Here, huh?

356
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,826
You don't mind me asking-
What the hell are you on?

357
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:22,066
Nothing! The car was right here.

358
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:28,569
- Right here.
- I saw his body. I touched it.

359
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:31,046
It's probably the same person
who killed Michelle Mancini.

360
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,582
That's impossible, baby.

361
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,518
The police arrested that gas station
attendant this afternoon.

362
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,084
It was a mannequin.

363
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,425
Damon uses it all the time
to scare pledges during hazing.

364
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:49,227
He also has this
life-size blow-up doll.

365
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,825
- But you don't wanna know about that.
- It wasn't a mannequin.

366
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,531
- Damon was dead.
- Come on.

367
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,938
Damon is the best practical joker
on this campus, all right?

368
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,706
He once convinced a freshman he was
the middle Hanson brother to get laid.

369
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:07,518
- Shouldn't he be enjoying his handiwork?
- Weekend snowboarding trip.

370
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,349
Some last-fling bachelor party
with some high school buddies.

371
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,013
Come on.

372
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,587
Whoa, wait a minute.

373
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,253
Scratching on the roof
of the car.

374
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,558
Don't you guys get it?

375
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,691
Come on.
Just like that urban legend.

376
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,861
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

377
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:28,497
Wexler talks about it
every semester in class.

378
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:32,304
You know? Guy and a girl
parked out in the woods, making out.

379
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,107
- You made out with him?
- Guy steps out of the car...

380
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,409
and the girl starts to hear
these scratching noises on the roof.

381
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,280
It's her dead boyfriend,
hung from a tree.

382
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,319
Damon's in the class.
He knew the myth.

383
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,378
He must've just planned
the whole thing out.

384
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,891
Well, I thought it was the only way
a girl would ever say he was hung.

385
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,722
Conniving bastard.

386
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:50,886
Wait a second.

387
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,589
Isn't there another story...

388
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,996
about a guy with an ax
hiding in a woman's back seat?

389
00:33:56,067 --> 00:34:00,504
Hello? My mom still checks the back seat
before getting into a car.

390
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,664
That's how Michelle Mancini died.

391
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,900
Oh, my God.

392
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,272
What are you trying to say?

393
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:09,143
It's like someone out there
is taking all these stories...

394
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,976
and making them reality?

395
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,482
Then my big question is,
what is he gonna do next?

396
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,490
Maybe put spider eggs in bubble gum
or ram a gerbil up a celebrity's ass.

397
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,489
Come on!

398
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,461
Give Damon a call
up at Kellington.

399
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,361
You'll see he's there.

400
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,006
- Do you mind if I use-
- What?

401
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,670
Never mind.

402
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:51,584
Yeah, there was a blonde guy who arrived
with that group this morning.

403
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,851
Bachelor party or something.

404
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,689
Damon Brooks, specifically.
Can you tell me if he checked in?

405
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,161
Well, I really
can't tell you that.

406
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,257
The cabin's not in his name,
and it's not on his credit card.

407
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:07,703
Look, I'm happy to take the message,
but I can't guarantee he'll pick it up.

408
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,706
So whatever you want me-

409
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:50,004
Hello?

410
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,049
Is someone there?

411
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

412
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,617
- Look what I found.
- What?

413
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,684
An early edition of "Kama Sutra"...

414
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:40,196
with illustrations.

415
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,562
You think Parker'll get into it?

416
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,225
Does he have a choice?

417
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,997
What's that?

418
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,677
- Don't tell me you still think-
- I don't know.

419
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,857
This is it.

420
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,846
Wait a second.
This is definitely not a myth.

421
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,712
- What?
- The "Gang High Beam Initiation. "

422
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,114
It happens all the time.

423
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,653
Gang members drive around at night
with their headlights off.

424
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,122
And when someone goes to flash their
high beams to warn 'em, they kill 'em.

425
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:44,787
That's why I never warn anybody
about anything when I drive.

426
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,797
Anyway, I gotta go.

427
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,628
I got some homework.

428
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,292
- See you later.
- Bye.

429
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

430
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,478
Sounds like Elvira's raising more
than just the dead in there.

431
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,103
Thanks for the warning.

432
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:02,598
I'm sorry.
I'm not looking.

433
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,743
Better check her pulse.
She's looked like that for years.

434
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,493
- How is she?
- I don't know.

435
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,537
I haven't had a chance
to talk to her yet.

436
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,707
All right.
I'll see you later.

437
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:30,304
We know this is
difficult for you, but...

438
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,906
we need to understand why...

439
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,917
if you heard moaning...

440
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:37,317
you didn't turn on the lights?

441
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,824
I'd walked in on Tash
having sex before.

442
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,552
It wasn't something
I cared to see again.

443
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,151
So you never actually
saw anyone there.

444
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,253
I sensed that-

445
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,595
No, honey, did you
see anyone in the room?

446
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:55,503
Did you know
Tash was manic-depressive?

447
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,930
She painted half the room black.

448
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,669
I had a pretty good idea.

449
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,540
There are no signs
of foul play here.

450
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,876
No forced entry.

451
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,540
What are you saying?

452
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,177
It appears to be
a tragic suicide.

453
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,347
No. Tash didn't kill herself.

454
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,221
There was someone else
in that room.

455
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,453
"Aren't you glad you didn't
turn on the lights," for Christ's sake?

456
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:20,554
A very morbid suicide note.

457
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:34,439
Honey, I am so sorry.
Are you all right?

458
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:38,777
Of course not.
Stupid question.

459
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,283
I mean, who would've thought
she would do something like that?

460
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,980
I mean, she's weird
and everything, but-

461
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,092
You wanna go get some coffee
and talk?

462
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,461
I just gotta be alone right now.

463
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:24,991
I know that this is
a really bad time for you...

464
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,429
but I gotta ask you
a couple of questions.

465
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,866
No, I'm not doing
any interviews.

466
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:35,894
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't wanna talk about Tash.

467
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:38,407
I just wanted to know...

468
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,841
if you can tell me
a little bit about this.

469
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:42,971
How did you get that?

470
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:47,450
I contacted
Michelle's high school-

471
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,110
your high school-

472
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,685
Now, why didn't you tell me
you knew her?

473
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:57,818
So you could exploit her death
more than you already have.

474
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:00,655
I'm just doing my job.

475
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:04,428
Okay? What am I supposed to do?
Turn my back on a murder?

476
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,332
Or a suicide?

477
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,098
It wasn't a suicide.

478
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,606
What are you talking about?

479
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,835
She was murdered.

480
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,470
Just like Michelle.
Just like Damon.

481
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,913
I don't know what's
going on here, but...

482
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,391
you know, if you want,
we can go somewhere and talk.

483
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,986
Off the record.

484
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,540
- You don't believe me either.
- That's not what I'm saying.

485
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:52,207
It's just that...

486
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:56,241
the idea of an urban legend
serial killer...

487
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,185
it's a stretch.

488
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,382
But don't you think it's possible?

489
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,620
Yeah, it's possible.

490
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,330
But I don't know.

491
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,966
Maybe the gas station attendant
killed Michelle.

492
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:14,367
Maybe Damon's snowboarding.

493
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,929
And maybe...

494
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,975
Tash just killed herself.

495
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:23,205
If it is true...

496
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,770
why like this?

497
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,782
Why now?

498
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:29,910
Tonight's the 25th anniversary.

499
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,047
What's that got to do
with anything?

500
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,115
The Stanley Hall Massacre.

501
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:39,959
I told you,
that story is not true.

502
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,792
Are you sure?

503
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:50,135
All right, if there's any truth
to Stanley Hall...

504
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,141
it'd be in here.

505
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,412
So this is where you research
all your lurid articles.

506
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,506
Reality is lurid, all right?

507
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,844
I'm only the messenger.

508
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,514
'71-'72, '74.

509
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,088
That's weird.
'73's not here.

510
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:22,871
How long you been workin' here?

511
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,033
Too damn long.

512
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,973
You know anything
about Stanley Hall?

513
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,147
I don't know
what you're talking about.

514
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:35,776
Did anyone die there?

515
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:40,651
Please.

516
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,185
We really need to know.

517
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,129
Talk to Wexler.

518
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,770
It's his office hours.
He should be here.

519
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:02,573
Here. Watch out.
Just a second.

520
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,189
Would you look at that?

521
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,667
So do they
teach you this in class?

522
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,269
I dropped Journalism Ethics early in
the semester. Wasn't helping my G.P.A.

523
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

524
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,135
Oh, shit.

525
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Is he gone?
- Yeah.

526
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,977
Something I can help you with?

527
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:21,779
You two break in
to a professor's office...

528
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:25,049
and then have the audacity
to accuse him of murder?

529
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,056
We found the ax.

530
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:31,527
That is a prop
I use in my folklore class.

531
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:34,359
How can you even suggest that I had
anything to do with that girl's death?

532
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:37,832
Why don't you tell us
about the Stanley Hall Massacre?

533
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,631
Professor Wexler, Reese...

534
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,334
may I have a moment alone
with them?

535
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,515
After our talk this morning...

536
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:55,574
I decided to take a look
at your personal file.

537
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,755
Probation for
reckless endangerment?

538
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,425
It was just for a year.

539
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,430
I'd already been accepted here.

540
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:10,625
Which was lucky.

541
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,167
We don't usually accept...

542
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,398
students with a criminal record.

543
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:17,901
As for you, young man...

544
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:19,703
you're off the paper...

545
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:21,505
effective immediately.

546
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,376
No, you can't do that, okay?

547
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,040
Read the charter.

548
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:29,108
The dean can't dictate
editorial policy.

549
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,552
I didn't fire you.

550
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:35,113
Your editor did.
We spoke an hour ago.

551
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:37,126
Have a good weekend.

552
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:44,665
What was all that about?
Reckless endangerment?

553
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,430
We're not exactly talking about
running a stop sign here, are we now?

554
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,836
I really don't
wanna talk about it.

555
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:51,669
Oh, okay, what do you want
to talk about?

556
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:54,266
My career options
without a body of writing samples?

557
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:57,211
Because for your information,
they're kind of limited.

558
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,148
It was in high school.
It's over.

559
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,709
Look. Does this have something
to do with Michelle Mancini?

560
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,915
Hey, I just wanna know
what's going on here...

561
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,959
'cause I don't know
if I buy it anymore.

562
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,929
I don't know
if I ever bought it.

563
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:44,356
It's gonna be a wet one
out there tonight, folks.

564
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,827
The storm is expected to bring
four inches of rain...

565
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:50,663
and 30-mile-per-hour winds
throughout most of New England.

566
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:53,601
Local authorities are advising
everyone to please stay indoors.

567
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,833
If you do decide to go out though,
make sure you grab a slicker.

568
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,364
Natalie, nothing is
gonna happen to me.

569
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,231
But why do you keep doing this
to yourself?

570
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:00,997
Look at you.

571
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,005
You've gotta stop this.

572
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,711
I knew Michelle Mancini.

573
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:14,276
We went to high school together.

574
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,512
We hadn't spoken in...

575
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,021
two years.

576
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:26,127
Why?

577
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:31,063
We were in my car one night.
Michelle was driving.

578
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:36,172
The story about the gang high beam
initiation had been going around.

579
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,505
Michelle wanted to play
a practical joke...

580
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:43,307
so she turned the headlights off...

581
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:48,175
and waited for the first car
to pass by and flash us.

582
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,584
When someone finally did...

583
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:54,590
she made a U-turn and...

584
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:57,416
started chasing him...

585
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:00,929
flashing her high beams, laughing.

586
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,735
I was laughing, too,
at first...

587
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,238
then we started going really fast.

588
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,178
I wanted to tell her to stop...

589
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,049
but I just sat there.

590
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:26,385
And then the other car
lost control and ran off the road.

591
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:36,031
He was our age.

592
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:42,133
By the time the ambulance came,
he was already dead.

593
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,975
The courts were lenient with us.

594
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:50,342
We just got probation.

595
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:59,649
I was never able to forgive her
for what she did.

596
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:06,492
I guess I couldn't forgive myself
for not doing something more to stop it.

597
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,588
Oh, my God.

598
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,826
How awful...

599
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,561
for everyone.

600
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,035
I don't know.
I think I should just go home.

601
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:20,600
Come on. You need to be relaxed,
have some fun and come to the party.

602
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:23,941
Please?

603
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:26,379
- Promise you won't leave me alone.
- I promise.

604
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:30,249
Unless, of course, I hook up with
some cute, little blue-eyed journalist.

605
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,982
Then you might have
to fend for yourself.

606
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

607
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,413
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

608
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:37,817
Little jumpy?

609
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:41,050
No, not at all.

610
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,285
I was just thinking.

611
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,327
Me too.

612
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:49,889
It wouldn't be a bad idea to add a few
extra guards this weekend just in case.

613
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,433
In case what?

614
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,561
Well, after that suicide and
what happened to the Mancini girl...

615
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:58,232
now I'm having trouble locating another
student, a boy named Damon Brooks.

616
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,299
He's been missing
for some days now.

617
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:04,073
Missing? He's not missing.
It's the weekend.

618
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,513
He's probably shacked up
in some motel...

619
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:10,110
with a girl or a guy
or a farm animal.

620
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:11,585
Whatever.

621
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,144
Weren't you ever 18?

622
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:16,192
- Not that kind of 18.
- My point is...

623
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:18,693
I don't want you overreacting.

624
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:23,164
Don't contact anyone
without my permission.

625
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,133
No parents. No police.

626
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:28,193
- Is that understood?
- Understood.

627
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,533
Good night, sir.

628
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

629
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:51,445
Go! Come on, boy!
There you go!

630
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,887
There you go!
That's my boy!

631
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,301
I love you!

632
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,599
Hey, listen.

633
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:16,239
That scream,
that's an actual cry for help...

634
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:18,246
by a girl being murdered.

635
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:21,078
- You're kidding me?
- No!

636
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,981
That's why it sounds so real...

637
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:26,078
because it was lifted
off a 911 tape.

638
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:28,356
- That's great.
- Yeah.

639
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:43,104
Hey, you made it!

640
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,540
And already,
I'm starting to regret it.

641
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,669
I'm gonna get something to drink.
You want anything?

642
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,509
- A beer.
- Okay. Be right back.

643
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:55,347
Stanley Hall's not a legend.
There was one survivor that night.

644
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:01,682
It makes perfect sense.

645
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:03,851
Pendleton covered up
Stanley Hall...

646
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:06,724
and Wexler, so long as
he keeps his mouth shut...

647
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,730
he gets a job for life.

648
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:11,665
- Why would he do it?
- It eats at him.

649
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:15,795
And probably every year around
this time, he goes a little wacko.

650
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:18,238
This year, off the charts.

651
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:21,640
Well, then, we have to call the police
right away before it happens again.

652
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:23,303
I already tried.

653
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:25,108
Dean Adams beat me to it.

654
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,173
They said he warned them
to expect some prank calls tonight.

655
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,185
He even gave them our names.

656
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:37,191
Look.

657
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:43,292
I'm sorry I doubted you before.

658
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:47,168
What?

659
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,937
- Hey.
- What is he trying to do to me?

660
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,039
I'm so scared.

661
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:02,283
Hey...

662
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,216
listen to me.

663
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:07,347
Nothing's gonna happen
to you, okay?

664
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,050
I promise.

665
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:23,562
You don't waste any time, do you?

666
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:27,876
- Here. It's light.
- Oh, shit.

667
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,878
What was all that about?

668
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:32,205
I screwed up.

669
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

670
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:01,507
Jesus! You trying to give me
a heart attack here?

671
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,374
Boo!

672
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,381
The building's off-limits
after 10:00.

673
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:10,618
Good night to you too.

674
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,909
Hello?

675
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,814
Oh. What?

676
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:19,915
Hey, Parker.

677
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:23,123
Let me talk to you for a second.

678
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,183
Look, you might wanna
end this party a little early.

679
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,489
What?

680
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:28,530
Natalie was right all along.

681
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,131
Say no more.
Everybody, listen up!

682
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,602
No, listen.
Turn the music down.

683
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,332
Listen, everybody.

684
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,677
Paul here, he thinks
we should end the party.

685
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,706
No.

686
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,476
Tell everybody
why they should go home.

687
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,215
There's a killer on campus.

688
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:55,615
And let me guess.

689
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:59,058
This killer is offing people...

690
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:01,956
based on urban legends.

691
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:03,726
Yeah, that's right.

692
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:09,631
Well, I've got a legend
that you may or may not have heard of.

693
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:14,665
This mediocre Woodward and Bernstein
wanna-be realized...

694
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:18,077
I'm gonna graduate in a couple of weeks
and end up writing gardening tips...

695
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:20,342
for Martha Stewart's "Living. "

696
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,884
Hang on.
Unless I get a really hot story.

697
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,079
Something that really flies.

698
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:27,418
I got it.

699
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,482
I'll take advantage
of my homicidal instincts...

700
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:31,856
and I'll start killing people...

701
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:35,159
in a trendy,
attention-getting, cover-story...

702
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,391
kind of way...

703
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:39,764
basing them on urban legends.

704
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:44,672
Why don't you have another drink?

705
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:49,074
Maybe you're the one that should leave
and let everybody else have a good time.

706
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,544
Right?

707
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,242
You stay here. I'm gonna go
get some help, all right?

708
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:03,187
Why do you always
have to be such a jerk?

709
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,523
I was just messing around.

710
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:08,085
I'm gonna go
to the radio station, okay?

711
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:10,860
Hey, who's my girl?

712
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:14,694
That's my girl!

713
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:22,910
Let's go.

714
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,451
Hello?

715
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:37,725
You're gonna die tonight.

716
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:41,062
Oh, really?

717
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:50,471
I see. The call's coming
from inside the house.

718
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:54,566
Could it be an urban legend?

719
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:57,134
Am I right? Hello?

720
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,408
Hey, don't get shy on me
all of a sudden, fuck face.

721
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:02,315
This is the one about
the baby-sitter, right?

722
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:05,582
She's getting those scary,
harassing phone calls.

723
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:07,918
When she traces them back...

724
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:10,823
they're coming
from inside the house, right?

725
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:14,852
But aren't you forgetting something?
I'm not baby-sitting any kids.

726
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,956
Wrong legend. This is the one
about the old lady...

727
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,526
who dries her wet dog
in the microwave.

728
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:47,525
Goddamn, fucking sick,
motherfucker!

729
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:49,188
Hootie. Fuck!

730
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:51,660
Wanna fuck with me?

731
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,093
Are you sure it's blood?

732
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:31,662
I'm sure it's blood.
I'm covered in it.

733
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,709
Due to the storm, all units
are presently responding to calls.

734
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,177
- A unit has been called.
- You know what really chaps my hide?

735
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:39,510
It's the way you pledge
to serve and protect...

736
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:42,210
and then you don't give a rat's ass
when something really happens.

737
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,717
Hold, please.

738
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:48,385
I'll do it myself.

739
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:55,663
This is Paul.
Leave a message.

740
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:00,800
So let me get this straight.

741
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,998
You guys just tried out this new
sexual position and you're stuck.

742
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:07,338
- I'm not stuck. He is.
- Just relax and stop clenching.

743
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:10,276
I saw this happen to dogs once.
It is so humiliating.

744
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:12,906
All right, you guys,
this is what you're gonna do, okay?

745
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,249
Hello?

746
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:20,288
Are you guys there?

747
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

748
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,169
Help me!

749
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:43,871
Somebody help me!

750
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:51,715
Something's happening.

751
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:56,622
No. She's doing a performance art piece
to commemorate the massacre.

752
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:05,665
Help me!

753
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:14,167
Oh, my God!

754
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:15,437
Please!

755
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:18,173
She's good. I got chills.

756
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

757
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:48,569
Somebody!

758
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,179
Someone, please!

759
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,012
Help! My God!

760
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:09,820
Please, help me!

761
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:49,022
No!

762
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:53,061
Please, I don't wanna die.

763
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:31,229
Sasha's dead!
I just saw her and the killer.

764
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:32,796
All right.
Where did this happen?

765
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,866
The radio station.

766
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:37,468
Jesus. Come on.

767
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:39,537
Why did you leave?

768
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:42,516
I thought I told you
to stay at the house.

769
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:44,518
Oh, shit.

770
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:52,853
- Where were you?
- Running all over campus.

771
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:55,055
Trying to find help.
The dean is gone.

772
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:57,564
I can't find Reese anywhere.

773
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:01,759
It's dead.

774
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:06,101
Goddamn storm.

775
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:09,910
We're gonna get the hell
out of here.

776
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:13,038
Gotta get off campus
and find some help.

777
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:20,487
- What are you doing?
- I was just making sure the-

778
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:22,285
I told you the phones were dead.

779
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,860
I'm on your side.

780
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:34,168
Let's get out of here.

781
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
We'll go into town.
We'll find a phone.

782
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:45,472
What's happening?
I heard Sasha on the radio.

783
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:46,605
She's dead.

784
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:48,081
Oh, my God.

785
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,243
- Are you sure?
- We're out of here.

786
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,786
What?

787
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,481
Hello?

788
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,331
Dean Adams...

789
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:08,028
this is Reese.

790
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:11,837
Hello? Are you there?

791
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:15,876
You have my number. Use it.

792
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:35,821
Do you smell something?

793
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,493
No.

794
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:43,197
We should stop at that gas station,
see if the phones work.

795
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,507
Fine.

796
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,809
Be right back.

797
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:09,453
- Oh, it does reek in here.
- Yeah.

798
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:18,003
I'm sorry that I acted
like such a jerk about you and Paul.

799
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:22,042
You two like each other.

800
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:24,044
Then you should be together.

801
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:07,077
Like I said, he's all yours.

802
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:33,210
- Where are we going?
- Back to campus.

803
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,226
Stop!

804
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:22,590
- What's wrong?
- Someone's after me.

805
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:24,256
Get in.

806
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,646
- You okay?
- No.

807
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,693
Got a coat right there.

808
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:06,530
Ain't gonna bite ya.

809
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:12,477
Just let me out here.

810
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:13,912
What?

811
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:17,343
What are you doing?

812
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:19,878
Please, just let me out.

813
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:22,890
It won't open from the inside.

814
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:26,720
Stop that!

815
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,027
What's wrong with you?

816
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:39,039
Idiot kids.

817
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,004
No!

818
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,439
It's him!

819
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,521
Keep going!

820
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:00,185
Come on.

821
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:05,228
Just keep going! Faster!

822
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:22,735
Hello? Is anybody there?

823
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,814
Help! Can you hear me?

824
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,977
- Hello?
- Somebody help me!

825
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:34,387
Oh, God!

826
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:42,721
Somebody help me!

827
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,724
Somebody help me!

828
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:14,557
He's gonna kill me!

829
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,735
Please! Somebody help me!

830
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:47,651
Please!

831
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

832
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

833
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:43,768
Gotcha!

834
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,905
I must say, Natalie...

835
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:50,177
you have proved
your friendship to me...

836
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:53,311
coming all the way out here
to rescue me...

837
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:56,016
without even a little pepper spray
to defend yourself.

838
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,752
Very endearing.

839
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,025
Excuse me?

840
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:02,893
I'm sorry, but I can't understand
a thing you're saying, doll.

841
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:09,259
Now, if I remove the gag...

842
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:11,168
you have got to promise me...

843
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:13,469
that you won't scream.

844
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:16,271
Lord knows I had
enough of that with Sasha.

845
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:22,339
You're fucking crazy!

846
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:28,314
I prefer the term "eccentric"...

847
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:29,481
but...

848
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:31,286
yeah...

849
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:33,327
I guess you could say
I'm a little nutty.

850
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:36,293
Why?

851
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:42,832
You still haven't
figured it out, have you?

852
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:45,936
Well, lucky for you, Miss Thang...

853
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:48,339
I've got a visual aid.

854
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:53,507
There I am...

855
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:55,773
with my boyfriend...

856
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:58,284
the love of my life.

857
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,780
Have you found the love
of your life yet?

858
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:05,085
Course not.

859
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,094
You're too self-involved to bother.

860
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:11,732
Pic ring any bells?

861
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:18,466
Oh, my God.

862
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:24,134
His name was David Evans.

863
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:29,711
The one you and your friend decided
to have a little fun with that night.

864
01:26:30,785 --> 01:26:32,776
David and I
were gonna get married...

865
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,287
that summer...

866
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:36,289
right after graduation.

867
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,758
He didn't have enough money
to buy me a ring yet so...

868
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:44,999
he got me this instead...

869
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:50,635
the night you
took him away from me!

870
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:52,900
Brenda, I wasn't-

871
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:55,772
You weren't driving,
but it was your car...

872
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:58,403
and you were there, Natalie!

873
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:01,974
Now...

874
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,347
didn't you tell me...

875
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:06,683
that you were having
a little difficulty...

876
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:08,346
forgiving yourself?

877
01:27:09,424 --> 01:27:10,584
I thought...

878
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:12,250
as a friend...

879
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:13,954
I could help you out
in that department.

880
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:19,022
Payback's a bitch!

881
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,658
Isn't it?

882
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:22,760
Brenda, please,
you need to get help.

883
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:25,305
I have already tried therapy!

884
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:27,967
Obviously, it did me no good.

885
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:29,475
And I must say...

886
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:31,774
I am kind of enjoying all this...

887
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:35,475
playing with your
pretty little head.

888
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:39,517
You used an urban legend
to kill my boyfriend.

889
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:41,020
And now-

890
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:42,681
What are you gonna do?

891
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:45,021
Oh, just my favorite U.L.

892
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:49,120
The Kidney Heist.

893
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,794
You do know this one, don't you?

894
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:56,860
Guy gets picked up
by a woman at a bar.

895
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:00,874
She takes him back to her hotel room.
Fixes him a drink. Boom! Knocked out.

896
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:03,172
When he wakes up,
he's in a bathtub full of ice...

897
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:05,735
and he realizes that one of his kidneys
has been removed.

898
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:09,040
Supposedly they sell them
on the black market.

899
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,347
I don't think
it's ever actually happened though.

900
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:13,920
Till tonight.

901
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:33,531
You won't get away with this.

902
01:28:33,608 --> 01:28:35,940
Natalie, of course I will.

903
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:37,443
I've got the perfect murder...

904
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:39,275
in the trunk of Paul's car.

905
01:28:41,749 --> 01:28:43,046
- You're sick.
- Professor...

906
01:28:43,117 --> 01:28:45,847
does away with his students,
then kills himself...

907
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,946
in the same manner
as the course he teaches.

908
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:50,456
It's beautiful.

909
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:52,993
It's so fucking clean, isn't it?

910
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:57,529
Well, enough chat, Nat.
I'm sorry.

911
01:28:57,598 --> 01:28:59,156
I don't have any anesthesia.

912
01:28:59,233 --> 01:29:02,031
I guess you'll just have to bite down
real hard on that gag...

913
01:29:02,103 --> 01:29:04,298
and hope that you go
into shock soon.

914
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:05,566
Please, don't do this.

915
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:09,472
Don't you wanna be
an urban legend?

916
01:29:09,544 --> 01:29:11,409
All your friends are now.

917
01:29:14,982 --> 01:29:17,314
Ouch! Stupid bitch!

918
01:29:19,554 --> 01:29:22,546
I'm really going to enjoy
watching you bleed to death.

919
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,321
Now, is this...

920
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,221
your kidney?

921
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:32,766
Or is that the liver?

922
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:35,302
I was always such a dope
in anatomy.

923
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,201
Well, who cares, right?

924
01:29:37,271 --> 01:29:40,638
First organ I see,
I'm just gonna grab it.

925
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,643
Drop the weapon!

926
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:52,281
Oh, great.
Rent-A-Cop to the rescue.

927
01:29:52,353 --> 01:29:55,117
Put your hands up.
Get up against the wall.

928
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:57,316
You loony psycho bitch.

929
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:01,920
It's all right, sugar.
It's gonna be okay.

930
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:04,628
Move it!

931
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:15,133
Don't you move.

932
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:33,886
Don't you fucking move.

933
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:36,890
Shit. Bullet through the head.

934
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:40,229
Not exactly an urban legend,
but in the essence of time.

935
01:30:40,301 --> 01:30:42,201
It's not gonna bring him back.

936
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,534
I know that...

937
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:47,403
but it will bring
a devastated little Paul...

938
01:30:47,475 --> 01:30:49,238
right into my arms.

939
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:52,336
I'll have him,
and he'll have his Pulitzer.

940
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:55,707
What did you think?

941
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:58,513
I was gonna let you take
two men out of my life?

942
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:03,884
Very well done.

943
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:08,395
I couldn't have planned it
better myself.

944
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:09,657
- Really?
- Yeah.

945
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:12,392
I mean, I thought I was screwed
after Natalie...

946
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:15,436
fucked it up for me
with the dean, but this-

947
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:19,071
This is just what I need.

948
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:22,606
A few things though.

949
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:24,936
I'm listening.

950
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:26,445
Well...

951
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:28,909
I need some details...

952
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:30,382
for my article.

953
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:34,186
You know, about how Wexler
did each one.

954
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:36,450
Details only you could give me.

955
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:39,254
It would be great
for your career.

956
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:42,762
And we would be
so fucking hot together.

957
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:46,866
And I'd be very grateful.

958
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:52,105
So why don't you give me the gun.

959
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,107
I'll take care of the rest.

960
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,109
You're cute.

961
01:31:58,045 --> 01:31:59,774
But you're not that fucking cute.

962
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:03,248
Now, which one of you...

963
01:32:03,317 --> 01:32:04,909
do I kill first?

964
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:07,784
Eenie, meanie...

965
01:32:07,855 --> 01:32:09,322
miney-

966
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:13,893
Mo.

967
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:20,129
What, are you gonna shoot me?

968
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:21,225
Huh?

969
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:24,505
What kind of friend are you?

970
01:32:41,155 --> 01:32:43,055
Give me the gun.

971
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:44,250
Come here.

972
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:45,917
- You all right?
- No.

973
01:32:54,035 --> 01:32:56,401
Thought I'd have to wait
to be a cop...

974
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:57,960
before a bullet ever hit me.

975
01:32:58,039 --> 01:32:59,529
Just stay down.

976
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:02,337
- We're gonna go get some help.
- All right. Quick.

977
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:11,784
Do you think Reese'Il be okay?

978
01:33:11,852 --> 01:33:14,980
Reese is gonna be fine.
Paramedics are on the way.

979
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:23,659
This'Il become a legend,
too, you know.

980
01:33:25,232 --> 01:33:27,894
It'll change a little
from person to person, of course.

981
01:33:29,303 --> 01:33:31,237
Brenda will become a guy.

982
01:33:33,374 --> 01:33:35,069
You'll become a cop.

983
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:40,074
And I'll end up
in some insane asylum.

984
01:33:40,147 --> 01:33:41,910
So if this is an urban legend...

985
01:33:43,918 --> 01:33:46,011
at what point
do we get to the twist?

986
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:09,899
The river was such a mess
'cause of the storm...

987
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:12,165
it washed away the body.

988
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,070
The thing of it is...

989
01:35:14,141 --> 01:35:16,871
they never found a body.

990
01:35:16,944 --> 01:35:18,468
It wasn't there.

991
01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:23,150
- Bullshit.
- It's true.

992
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:26,277
Happened right here at Ashton.
I swear to God.

993
01:35:26,353 --> 01:35:29,481
That is a stupid story you hear
at every campus in the northeast.

994
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:31,889
Exactly.
I mean, where's your proof?

995
01:35:31,959 --> 01:35:35,292
Were you even listening?
It all keeps getting covered up.

996
01:35:35,362 --> 01:35:36,795
Think about it.

997
01:35:36,864 --> 01:35:38,855
Who would enroll at Murder U.?

998
01:35:38,933 --> 01:35:40,366
Yeah. And you know what?

999
01:35:40,434 --> 01:35:43,198
Natalie-
she's my old roommate's cousin.

1000
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:45,500
And Brenda's the girl
in that Noxzema commercial.

1001
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:49,767
Look, does anybody here
believe me?

1002
01:35:49,844 --> 01:35:51,277
- Not a chance.
- No.

1003
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:56,411
- I believe you.
- Thank you.

1004
01:35:56,484 --> 01:35:58,918
But you didn't tell it right.

1005
01:35:58,986 --> 01:36:01,079
I didn't?

1006
01:36:01,155 --> 01:36:02,884
Not at all.

1007
01:36:02,957 --> 01:36:05,118
Okay, listen up, guys...

1008
01:36:10,119 --> 01:36:16,119
