00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:17,374
Did you hear that?

3
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:19,342
Well, I don't hear anything.

4
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:21,044
Shut your fucking mouth.

5
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:22,847
I definitely heard something.

6
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:45,535
You should go check it out.

7
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,639
Um, no, let's go.
I have a bad feeling.

8
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:52,475
Come on. It's probably nothing.

9
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:54,945
What are you talking about?
How could that be nothing?

10
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:57,448
Why are you being such
a little bitch about this?

11
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:03,020
- What?
- I'm sorry.

12
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,389
I just heard
you were a fucking man.

13
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:49,333
Anything?

14
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,103
Uh... no.

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fuck this.

16
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:30,875
Aah!

17
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,511
It worked!

18
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,915
- Quick, do it while he's down.
- Yeah.

19
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:42,987
Huh? It's not working.

20
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,288
Fucking Amazon.

21
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,858
Aaaah!

22
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,359
I think he barely
even feels it.

23
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:50,661
I got this.

24
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:15,251
Ugh.

25
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:21,024
- Do you want to cry for help?
- Go ahead, we'll wait.

26
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:22,659
- Uh...
- Where's his I. D.?

27
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:27,664
Lowell Orson Lehmann?

28
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,332
- Lehmann.
- Good name for the news.

29
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:31,935
Age 42, 6'6",
235 pounds.

30
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,137
- Ooh.
- You realize this expires

31
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,704
in, like, a month, right?

32
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:38,341
You bitches made the stupidest
mistake of your lives.

33
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:39,442
Ah! It speaks?

34
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:41,945
I'm gonna cut your insides out.

35
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,418
I'm gonna skull-fuck
your severed heads

36
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,651
while your parents watch!

37
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:56,327
You don't know
what I'm capable of.

38
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,628
What?
Of course we know.

39
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,197
We're your biggest fans, dude!

40
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,865
Seen everything
you've ever done.

41
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:03,666
Well, everything we know about.
We're pretty sure it's four.

42
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:07,003
- Since last May, is that right?
- Five, plus Craig.

43
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:10,039
Totes. You know, you can
follow us, if you want.

44
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,909
It's @TragedyGirls.
That's two, plural.

45
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:14,644
See this?

46
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:16,079
You wouldn't believe
how relieved we were

47
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,413
when you started
knocking off freshies.

48
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:19,115
This town can be,
like, so boring.

49
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:21,050
It took us a while
to figure out, but we did.

50
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:23,152
How many weeks apart
before he strikes again?

51
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:25,221
You really have a thing
for girls with short hair.

52
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:27,558
Fortunately for everyone,
I look great in a pixie cut.

53
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,892
She does.

54
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:30,426
All it took was a few boys
to set the trap.

55
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:32,529
Do you know how many handjobs
this girl had to give?

56
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:33,764
Like 30.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
But you finally showed.
And you didn't disappoint.
We are gonna have
so much fun together.
Oh!

58
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:46,776
Aaah!

59
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:50,813
You smell that?

60
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:53,082
That's your fucking
skin burning!

61
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:55,952
Make no mistake
who's in charge, bitch.

62
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:57,721
We're on the same side,
you know.

63
00:05:57,723 --> 00:05:59,255
We want the same things.

64
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:01,257
We just don't <i>know</i> everything.

65
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,428
- That's where you come in.
- We need a trainer.

66
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,630
A teacher. Yoda.

67
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,966
Now, McKayla here... she wasn't
really sold on the idea.

68
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:11,368
Hmm. I had to be convinced.

69
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,971
Luckily, I understand
the importance

70
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,839
of a close student-teacher
relationship.

71
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,074
And I bet you
are dying to impart

72
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:19,276
a little of your experience

73
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,711
on a few ambitious
up-and-comers.

74
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,945
Am I right?

75
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,517
- Gross.
- Hey!

76
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,887
Bad Lowell! No!

77
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,221
- No!
- We'll see how you feel

78
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:33,690
after a few days
to think it over.

79
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,993
What the shit?

80
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:38,594
You've got to be kidding me.

81
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:41,397
You couldn't even
do that right?

82
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,105
Craig, bae.

83
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:51,774
Ambulance.

84
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:53,810
They're on their way.
Just hang in there.

85
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,976
You're back down to four.

86
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,399
Do you ever do this?

87
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,368
The whole "industrial lye
to melt the body" thing?

88
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,870
We stole it
from "Breaking Bad,"

89
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,238
but it totally works.

90
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,772
Yeah, it took a lot
of stray cats and dogs

91
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:57,041
to get this mixture down.

92
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:03,312
- Past his bedtime.
- On it!

93
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:06,817
Stay the fuck away from me!
Oh!

94
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:18,228
- She's got my vote.
- Really?

95
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,130
- Just joking, bitch.
- Hey, guys! Who's left?

96
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,432
Hey!

97
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,598
Oh, they just cut
Rusty and Tina,

98
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,735
so we're rooting
for Lucy and J.T.

99
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,070
- How was prom planning?
- Really great.

100
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:28,772
Sadie and I have
some really good ideas.

101
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,940
Well, it's your senior year.
Enjoy it!

102
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:32,276
I'll try.

103
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,445
But I've got
a big day tomorrow, so bye.

104
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,647
- Good night, sweetie!
- Night, baby!

105
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,984
- Sorry I'm late.
- All good, kiddo.

106
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:43,353
Thanks for the leftovers.

107
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,722
- No problem.
- Did you take the truck out?

108
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:47,925
Yeah. Grocery run.
And, yes, I filled the tank.

109
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,359
That's my girl.

110
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:53,229
- Night, pop.
- Night, kid.

111
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:55,898
Hey! Have you seen
the cat lately?

112
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,733
Nope. Sorry.

113
00:08:57,735 --> 00:08:59,670
Weird.

114
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:13,483
We were gonna hang out, but
then he just stopped texting.

115
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:15,252
Did you guys, like,
hear from him?

116
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,652
It's been, like,
a really long time.

117
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:19,522
- Because he was such a good guy.
- I know, right?

118
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:21,691
I really hope nothing bad
happened to him.

119
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:25,094
It's like... poof...
he vanished, right?

120
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,662
I'm so scared right now.

121
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:28,765
Death is just an inevitable
part of life, you know?

122
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,400
Yeah, we have to,
like, treasure

123
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:34,438
the time we have or whatever.

124
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,275
It's, like, anybody
could be next, even you.

125
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,143
You can find more information

126
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:41,445
about the recent
unsolved murders

127
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,879
on our Tragedy Girls
Twitter page.

128
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:45,047
You know, if you want.

129
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:52,388
I know, right?

130
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,925
Okay, quiet down, everyone.
Quiet.

131
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,493
Okay, before we get started,

132
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,329
I think that we need to address
the elephant in the room.

133
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:01,831
Craig is a model citizen
of this school.

134
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:06,069
And if you need anyone
to talk to, I'm here.

135
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:07,337
Okay?

136
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:09,439
Oh.

137
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:13,776
I'm gonna leave you
with the sheriff.

138
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:15,481
Mrs. Kent.

139
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,081
Now, I know there's been
a lot of speculation

140
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,285
as to what happened.
And at this time,

141
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,786
we firmly believe
Craig has run away from home.

142
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:25,855
No!

143
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:28,157
I mean...
how do you know?

144
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,725
I'm not at liberty to say.

145
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:31,627
So, there's no suspicion
of foul play?

146
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:33,763
What about the recent string
of deaths in the tri-town area?

147
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:35,666
Okay, girls, could we just
give it a rest, please?

148
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,969
No, it's okay, Charlotte.
There's no need to panic,

149
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,838
but if anyone has further
information about Craig,

150
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,475
do not hesitate to come forward
so we can bring him home safe.

151
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:47,710
Really?

152
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:50,948
There's nothing else
you want to warn us about?

153
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,382
No, Jordan.

154
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:55,919
Not at this time.

155
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,121
Mrs. Kent.

156
00:10:58,123 --> 00:11:00,757
Thanks, Sheriff.

157
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,526
I know how easy it is
to spread rumors

158
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:03,859
when you're in high school,

159
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:06,863
but can we please try
and be respectful?

160
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:08,433
That goes for everyone.

161
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:16,373
The sheriff's office
is in full-on denial.

162
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,642
But are they telling
the <i>full</i> truth?

163
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:22,345
- How was that?
- Eh, I could go again.

164
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:24,414
We need to emphasize
the Upworthy-ness.

165
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,083
'Kay, one sec.

166
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,020
I can't believe
everyone is so calm.

167
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,656
I mean, there's a dangerous
killer on the loose...

168
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,023
so to speak.

169
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:36,026
Well, they jumped the gun
on bringing in Jordan's dad.

170
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:40,363
There hasn't even been
a stake-raising second death.

171
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,065
What's with you
and that mama's boy anyway?

172
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:44,133
Nothing.

173
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:46,203
We're sort of friends.

174
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,871
Well, you don't need
any friends.

175
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,307
- You have me.
- Aw, someone's jelly.

176
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:52,709
I'm not jelly.

177
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,877
He just has
a pathetic crush on you.

178
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,414
Ever since he got held back
a year, he's been super-clingy.

179
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,648
Put him out of his misery
already.

180
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,584
Um, we need him
for the video editing?

181
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:04,720
He's legit talented.
We only got one retweet today...

182
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:06,189
from your mom.

183
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:08,324
Sad.

184
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:10,526
Fine. We'll step up our game.

185
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,065
Now it's important
to distinguish

186
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,768
what kind of killers
we're talking about here.

187
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,037
Serial killers can operate
over many years

188
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,507
and have very distinct patterns
when selecting their victims.

189
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,978
While spree killers don't
have cooling-off periods,

190
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,381
and kill like 2 or more people
in a short amount of time.

191
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,685
- So it's like a Jeffrey Dahmer...
- Ugh.

192
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,321
- Versus a Charles Starkweather...
- Hmm.

193
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:41,157
But what kind of killer is
operating in Rosedale right now?

194
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,426
And more importantly,
is he behind the disappearance

195
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,927
of Craig Thompson?

196
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:48,898
- And even more importantly...
- Who will be next?

197
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,905
Yeah, so, I think my roto here
works pretty well.

198
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,641
And, uh, you guys really sell it
with the performances.

199
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,242
This is great, Jordan.

200
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:01,744
Yeah, feel free
to stop whenever.

201
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:03,379
You know, my dad says
there's no killer

202
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:05,248
because he doesn't want
to scare people.

203
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,352
But you guys want
to tell the truth,

204
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,290
and so do I.

205
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,324
Cool. So can you
just, like, upload it

206
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,193
whenever it renders or whatever?

207
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,828
Yeah. Okay.

208
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,730
- Thanks, J.
- Oh, wait!

209
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:25,835
Uh, this is yours.
"Martyrs" was just horrifying.

210
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:28,438
So fucked up.
It's great, right?

211
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,040
Yeah, yeah.
Um, you know,

212
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,242
I've been getting into
more European stuff lately,

213
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,944
if you ever want to...
come over.

214
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,714
- We have cheer.
- Yeah. Sorry.

215
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,549
Okay. Yeah. Cool. It's cool.

216
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:42,618
Uh, maybe some other time,
if you ever want to...

217
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,853
Great. So, I'll... I'll
just post this,

218
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:46,956
once it's uh, uh,
once it's all good.

219
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,960
Hashtag Tragedy Girls!

220
00:13:57,668 --> 00:14:00,270
We've got a comment
on our video already.

221
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,172
"I made 8,000 dollars this week,
working from home."

222
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:05,709
Fucking spambots.

223
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,777
It's like nobody cares
what we're doing.

224
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,278
I know.

225
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,046
- Well, how's our new pet?
- Hmm.

226
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,252
So boring.
It's like old drifter Periscope.

227
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:18,988
I can't believe he's being
such a dick about helping us.

228
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,456
He's like, "I'm gonna gut you
like a fish."

229
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,158
Get over yourself, man.

230
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,859
Well, that's it, I guess.
I don't know

231
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:25,328
how we're gonna become
horror legends

232
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,595
without an iconic killer.

233
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:28,698
Dude, I told you,
we don't need him.

234
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,435
Your brains, my charisma,
we can do anything.

235
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,905
No offense, but last I checked,
that didn't work out so well.

236
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,605
That was like a million
years ago.

237
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:38,441
We could kill the juice-bar guy.

238
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:46,315
Hi.

239
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:47,950
He knows.

240
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:50,753
Sometimes I just feel
like nothing I do matters.

241
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:52,756
Like, I'm not special.

242
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,757
Look, we're about to graduate
and go to college,

243
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,792
and we haven't even started
our first killing spree.

244
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,094
Is that what you want?

245
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:00,497
Of course not.
But it's about the story.

246
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,468
It's got to be legend-worthy.

247
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:04,401
Something people
will never forget.

248
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,602
Hmm.

249
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,940
Wait.

250
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,242
We just need 100,000 followers
by prom,

251
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,542
and we'll be on our way.

252
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:14,911
So we steal Lowell's
gross identity,

253
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,680
and use it to leverage
our online presence.

254
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,348
Then we frame him
for everything.

255
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,249
Exactly. To the next phase.

256
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,550
To the next phase.

257
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:24,421
Be aggressive!
Be, be aggressive!

258
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,257
Rosedale, Rosedale,
we're the best!

259
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,895
Growing stronger than the rest!
Be aggressive!

260
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,530
- Be, be aggressive!
- Be, be beheaded

261
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,364
Whoo!

262
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:36,932
- Whoo!
- Put your head down!

263
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:38,868
- Why do we do this?
- Forget it.

264
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,204
- Hi, ladies!
- Hi, Syl.

265
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,138
What?

266
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,376
- Super-cute shoes, McKayla.
- Thank you.

267
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,776
But, as you know,

268
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:49,512
we are supposed to have
the proper footwear

269
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:51,414
for the pyramids
and the catching.

270
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,083
So?

271
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,685
So I just don't think
they're very practical.

272
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:57,087
Don't get me wrong, I love them.

273
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,223
But maybe you could just
sit this one out, okay?

274
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,492
I just want everyone to be safe.

275
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,460
Bye!

276
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:05,896
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

277
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,364
- What a cunt.
- Right?

278
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:11,700
Rosedale High is trending.

279
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:14,204
Hashtag RosedaleKiller
or hashtag PrayForCraig?

280
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,638
Ugh. Neither.

281
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,239
It's your leather jacket
of an ex-boyfriend.

282
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:18,908
Oh.

283
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,044
Jesus, are all of these pics
just him and his crotch rocket?

284
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:24,180
- Yeah.
- And these song lyrics...

285
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:25,714
He's so sensitive.

286
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:27,584
He has so many more
followers than we do,

287
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,319
and it's literally
the same thing!

288
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,454
- What?!
- It's okay.

289
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:34,590
You've really grown so much
in these last 12 hours.

290
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:36,493
Be strong.

291
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,460
Excuse me. Pardon me.

292
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:40,729
Hey.

293
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:42,065
What's up?

294
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,001
Hi, Tobes.

295
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,469
Hey, Kay-Kay.

296
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:48,238
How are you doing?

297
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,339
I'm good. Yeah, I'm good.
I'm just...

298
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:52,975
I'm, like, really upset
about Craig and everything,

299
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:54,511
- but...
- That's good.

300
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,780
You need to be open right now
to experience everything.

301
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,248
- I'm so open.
- As scary as it may be,

302
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,819
you can't be afraid
to ride that wave.

303
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,921
- I'm gonna ride it.
- No matter how terrifying it is.

304
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:08,424
- Embrace it, okay?
- I'm gonna embrace it so hard.

305
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,396
Yeah, so we happened to see
some of your posts about Craig.

306
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:16,231
And they're really similar
to what we're doing.

307
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:17,866
So we were just wondering
if maybe you could

308
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:20,703
- give our blog a shout-out?
- Yeah, I don't...

309
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:23,139
I don't think Toby
really does shout-outs.

310
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:25,609
I don't know, I think
that a shout-out from me

311
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,643
would be a little off-brand.

312
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:29,045
Something is definitely
happening in Rosedale,

313
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:31,280
and I think
that Craig would agree.

314
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:34,417
Look, I say what I feel.

315
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:38,587
If people connect with it,
then... that's beautiful.

316
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,726
But I'm no hero.

317
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,862
Just one post.
It'd really help us out.

318
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,831
I miss you so much, Tobes.

319
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,132
- I miss you too, Kay-kay.
- Really?

320
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:52,201
I've been thinking a lot
about us lately.

321
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:56,238
But everything that happened
with Craig is just so...

322
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,040
so messed-up.

323
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,009
You know?
All we have is each other,

324
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:04,113
and I need to express myself
for the community.

325
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:08,317
The whole community needs me
to be present for them.

326
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,952
You understand?

327
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:12,389
I have 15,000 followers.

328
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,027
We so need to kill him.

329
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:20,229
But why do we have to kill
the cute ones first?

330
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:22,297
To make an omelet, you have
to kill some ex-boyfriends.

331
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:24,968
Plus he's hella-annoying,
and he's distracting you.

332
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,369
Yeah, but how do we do this?

333
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,270
I mean, what are we
trying to say here?

334
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:31,106
How about "I just stabbed your
basic bitch-ass in the throat

335
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:32,709
'cause of your
emo status update."

336
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,143
Be serious.

337
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:35,745
Okay, you're the one
who's always saying

338
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,248
that we have to have
a higher plan and shit.

339
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,849
You're right. If we don't
put thought into this,

340
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:41,316
we're no different

341
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:42,719
than the Texas Chainsaw
reject we have tied up.

342
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,720
He's always just trying
to escape.

343
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:45,988
So boring.

344
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,724
Why did you and Toby
break up, again?

345
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,392
He said he needed
to find himself.

346
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,461
But really he just found
a sick deal on a motorbike,

347
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:54,463
which made him like 20% hotter.

348
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:57,933
Wait. I could see it as
a "Death Proof" kind of thing.

349
00:18:57,935 --> 00:18:59,401
I can work with that.

350
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:01,203
Yas, queen.

351
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:07,509
Hey! Hey!

352
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:12,315
- Yeah, yeah, like that.
- Making its way downtown.

353
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,386
Ugh! Oh.

354
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,121
Dinner time!

355
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,622
Eat up, Lehmann.

356
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:21,290
It's all good protein.

357
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:28,698
We... look... amazing.

358
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,499
- Hot, right?
- Yeah.

359
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:33,169
But we're totally gonna have to
start wearing masks,

360
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:35,371
'cause if we keep
dressing this good...

361
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:38,540
people gonna know it's us.

362
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:39,808
Let's talk Toby.

363
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,178
Okay, so, he will be
at his house,

364
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,980
working on his hog.
Sexy.

365
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:48,517
Um, but, then he likes to go
for a ride on Connor Road

366
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:51,019
to, like, think.

367
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:53,189
Let's give him
something to think about.

368
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,035
Hello?

369
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:09,205
Hello?

370
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:12,709
Who is this?

371
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,112
Angela?

372
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,782
Tatum?

373
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:22,651
Michelle?

374
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:24,787
McKayla?

375
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:41,036
I was number 4?

376
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,072
Proceeding with phase 2.

377
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:25,347
Go around!

378
00:21:57,548 --> 00:21:59,649
Aaah!

379
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:03,052
Aah!

380
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,322
Aah! How'd it look?

381
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:08,091
- Here you go.
- Ooh!

382
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:21,069
Again?

383
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:23,538
Motherfucker!

384
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,078
Oh!

385
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,715
Shut up.
Someone might hear you.

386
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:36,652
More to the left.
His heart is more to the left.

387
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:38,254
Ugh!

388
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,189
Ugh!

389
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:42,057
- You're just hitting bone, dude.
- I'm trying.

390
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,393
Give it.

391
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:49,097
Ugh!

392
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,037
- Help! Help!
- Someone's coming.

393
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,972
Help me!

394
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:58,841
Shh!

395
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:04,212
- Hey.
- Hey. Everything okay?

396
00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:06,915
Yeah.
Just a little car trouble.

397
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:08,951
Oh.
Can I help out?

398
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:10,420
That's all right.

399
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,555
I know how to change a tire.

400
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:15,290
- You sure?
- Yeah.

401
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:16,959
Pretty good with my hands.

402
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:19,261
And... And tires.

403
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:22,899
Help!

404
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,467
Shh.

405
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,369
Uh, my friend is really
into Candy Crush.

406
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,537
She hasn't scored a jelly in,
like, a hot minute, so...

407
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:30,773
- Oh. Okay, I know how that is.
- Yeah.

408
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:45,520
If I'm gonna be murdered,
I'm so happy it's you.

409
00:24:09,346 --> 00:24:10,947
M-Kay!

410
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,882
What the fuck?

411
00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:15,551
Nothing.

412
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:19,455
Got him.

413
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,024
Ugh. Okay.

414
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,959
- You ready to rehearse this?
- Yeah.

415
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,128
So, we were just driving
down the street

416
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,863
after our morning workout,
obviously.

417
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,564
And there was this body there.

418
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:31,667
And I'm not a CSI person, but
it looked like he was murdered.

419
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:33,302
Okay.

420
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:38,240
I'm not a CSI person,

421
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:39,875
but it looked like
he was murdered.

422
00:24:39,877 --> 00:24:43,345
Murdered? The coroner's report
says it was an accident.

423
00:24:43,347 --> 00:24:45,715
- So devastating.
- But wasn't there evidence

424
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,315
that he was stabbed
multiple times?

425
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:49,151
That's just what we heard.

426
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:51,653
You can watch the video on our
YouTube channel, Tragedy Girls.

427
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:53,488
Girls, plural. We have
a Twitter and a Tumblr.

428
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,357
Look, girls,
points for enthusiasm,

429
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,626
but please let the professionals
handle this, okay?

430
00:24:57,628 --> 00:24:58,861
Just one interview.

431
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:00,630
I mean, we can say
whatever you want us to say.

432
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,131
We'll post a link
on our website.

433
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,565
We can help each other out.

434
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:06,436
Real journalism is based
in facts, not hashtags.

435
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,969
Why are you even here?

436
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:10,405
Young people and road safety.
That's the real story.

437
00:25:10,407 --> 00:25:12,141
Now, if you'll excuse me,
please.

438
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,076
Can we get the shots
of the cars parking?

439
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:15,444
- Please, like, right now?
- Sure.

440
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:18,613
Parked cars.
They're not going anywhere.

441
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:21,383
I tried to show my dad
your page, but he won't budge.

442
00:25:21,385 --> 00:25:23,652
He just said,
"Motorbikes are dangerous."

443
00:25:23,654 --> 00:25:26,021
Okay, well, maybe we can
use this to our advantage?

444
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:28,857
Make a "Rosedale Murder
Cover-Up" video?

445
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:31,094
He also said I probably
shouldn't be making movies

446
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,929
with you guys anymore.

447
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:37,467
- And what did you say?
- Told him to fuck off.

448
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,169
Not using those exact words,
but you know,

449
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,770
I think we left things
ambiguous enough

450
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:43,905
that he probably knows
what I'm gonna do.

451
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:46,241
But, guys, if there's some
sort of psycho on the loose,

452
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:47,410
you need to leave it alone.

453
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,077
Don't be lame,
we're not scared.

454
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:51,581
No, I'm serious.
I...

455
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,616
Look, I just don't want see...
anybody get hurt.

456
00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:59,087
Well, I promise we'll stop

457
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:00,957
if I ever feel like
we're in danger.

458
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,959
Okay?

459
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,462
Okay.

460
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,131
Well, we're late
for Prom Committee.

461
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,532
But, hey, Jordan,

462
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,566
maybe you should find
a date to prom, you know,

463
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:14,036
'cause it's gonna be fun
and you don't want to go alone.

464
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:15,872
Because that's
extremely pathetic.

465
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:19,475
Maybe your daddy
can help you find someone.

466
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,386
Je-scuse moi?

467
00:26:31,388 --> 00:26:33,855
Could you repeat that, Syl?
For the record?

468
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:37,125
Yes. Like I was saying, two of
our fellow classmates are gone,

469
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:39,594
and I think, to honor them,
we should tone down the dance.

470
00:26:39,596 --> 00:26:41,863
It is so tragic we lost Craig
before his time...

471
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:45,468
And my ex, Toby.
May he rest in peace.

472
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,938
As a junior, you may not
quite understand this yet, Syl,

473
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,107
but I think it would actually
dishonor their memory.

474
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:55,478
Yeah, if we don't have prom,
then the haters win, Syl.

475
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,381
Plus, we already made
the deposit on the deejay.

476
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,915
And that shit's nonrefundable.

477
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:01,883
I hear you, but that was
before everything happened.

478
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:04,253
I think we should donate
our budget to the families.

479
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,488
Right?

480
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,294
Goodness.

481
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,830
Order! Syl makes, like,
some really good points,

482
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:18,366
but I think we should
celebrate how they lived.

483
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:19,768
Well, I think
we should vote on it.

484
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,238
And I'd like to be
the first to motion this.

485
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,375
- Seconded?
- Mm-hmm.

486
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:29,911
Well, let the record show

487
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:32,180
that both the president
and the vice president

488
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:34,650
are vehemently
opposed to this change.

489
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,852
- Vehemently!
- Well, I would just like

490
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:39,020
to thank you all for coming,
and I just really hope

491
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:41,457
that we can all
band together as a class

492
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,926
and really respect each other
and bring together...

493
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,767
- What the hell is that?
- Syl made it. It's a library.

494
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:54,469
A library for what?

495
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:56,305
People make these and put them
in front of their houses

496
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:57,606
with used copies of "Twilight,"

497
00:27:57,608 --> 00:27:59,408
and old people
borrow books from them.

498
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,843
It's a thing.

499
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,278
How did that prissy bitch
get so good at woodshop?

500
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,880
"I really hope
that my work can inspire

501
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:06,382
free little libraries
everywhere,

502
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,150
and really do some good.
You know?"

503
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:10,318
And it's going to the state
competition this weekend

504
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,889
as Rosedale's official entry.

505
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:15,591
Not anymore.

506
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,830
So, if I move my shift
at the shelter,

507
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,163
that would clear up
the afternoon

508
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:23,966
to go to the old folks' home.

509
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,934
- Right?
- Okay.

510
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,678
Who did this?

511
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,449
How am I supposed to get my
lending-library scholarship now?

512
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:42,951
Don't just stand there, help me!

513
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:46,122
How could you let this happen?
You get every piece.

514
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:57,999
No matter how hard I work,
it'll never be the same.

515
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:04,373
Oh... my God.

516
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,875
You are ruining it!
Just... Just get out.

517
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:09,711
Okay? Go, go, go, go.
We're leaving.

518
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:11,279
Thank you.

519
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,441
Goodnight, Mr. Gordon.

520
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:41,744
Night, uh, you.

521
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,422
Hello?

522
00:29:54,424 --> 00:29:56,861
I'm still working in here.

523
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:00,629
People.

524
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,199
I said I'm still in here!

525
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:06,201
Look, Mr. Wan said that I could!

526
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You have got to be kidding me.

527
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

528
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,710
Jesus, you scared me.

529
00:30:48,712 --> 00:30:51,881
Sorry, I thought I was
the only one in here.

530
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,083
Did your Drama Club run late?

531
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Okay, can I help you?
I'm kind of
working on something.
Okay.

532
00:31:07,164 --> 00:31:09,832
Okay, what is this?

533
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,603
Uh, Mr. Gordon?!

534
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:16,971
Anyone? No?

535
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:21,876
- McKayla?
- Shit.

536
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:24,947
- Damn it, M-Kay!
- I'm sorry.

537
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,748
Not really feeling this
whole pantomime thing anyway.

538
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,151
- Stay in character!
- Ugh.

539
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:37,293
Oh!

540
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,796
Oh!

541
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,799
Aah!

542
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:46,568
Oh! Aah!

543
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,271
Aah! Aaaah!

544
00:31:59,115 --> 00:32:00,982
Did that just...

545
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:02,617
I can't even...

546
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:05,153
That is some serious
"Final Destination" shit.

547
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:06,721
Damn it.

548
00:32:06,723 --> 00:32:09,491
This is still gonna
look like an accident, again!

549
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:11,896
What do we do?

550
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,370
Ugh. Like this?

551
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,373
Yeah, just so there's
no possible way

552
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,375
she could have
done this herself.

553
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,419
Check it out.

554
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:39,455
"Your shoes are not regulation."

555
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:57,199
McKayla... just a few words.

556
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,500
How does it feel to see your
conspiracy theory come to life?

557
00:33:59,502 --> 00:34:01,069
Honestly, I'm not surprised.

558
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:02,837
You know, I've been the voice
of reason in Rosedale...

559
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,238
- I'm sorry, you can't do this.
- Excuse me,

560
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,708
- we're doing an interview.
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.

561
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,008
- This is not allowed.
- I was doing...

562
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,144
But I look really cute today.

563
00:34:09,146 --> 00:34:11,280
Can I get a picture with you
by your locker?

564
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,880
- That would really help me out.
- Yeah.

565
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:15,818
Thanks.

566
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,722
Hey. Uh, you guys need
to take it down a notch.

567
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,789
Why? We're finally getting

568
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:23,758
the recognition
that we deserve

569
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,161
on this very important
public-safety issue...

570
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:27,195
or whatever.

571
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:29,764
- Whoa, what happened there?
- Nothing.

572
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:33,334
- Is that blood?
- Heavy-flow day.

573
00:34:33,336 --> 00:34:36,204
I don't know. That's not
how that works, right?

574
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:38,307
Sadie Cunningham
and McKayla Hooper

575
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,175
to the principal's office
immediately.

576
00:34:40,177 --> 00:34:41,376
Sadie and McKayla.

577
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:43,679
Okay, my dad is really
pissed at you guys.

578
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:44,813
Why?

579
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:47,048
He wants to bring you in...

580
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,983
for interfering
with an investigation.

581
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:52,521
- Shut up! Really?
- Okay, well, um...

582
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:55,124
if... if Sadie needs, like,
an alibi or something,

583
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,059
just to get her out of a jam,
just tell her...

584
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,394
She can say she was with me

585
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,695
watching some
Dario Argento movie, okay?

586
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:04,800
- Dario DiGiorno.
- Dario Argento.

587
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:08,103
Dario Arpeggio. Mario Wario.

588
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:13,909
I don't know. I don't care.
Bye-sies!

589
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,378
- Hey, can I?
- Obviously.

590
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,146
Hmm.

591
00:35:20,684 --> 00:35:22,251
Now, I want to assure you both

592
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:25,787
that no one here is
accusing you girls of anything.

593
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:27,990
- We were just trying to help.
- But if you guys

594
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:29,724
would just admit
that something's going on...

595
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:31,659
I don't need advice
from teenagers

596
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:34,128
on how to protect
this community.

597
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,700
Okay, no one here
is the bad guy.

598
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,534
If there is a perpetrator,

599
00:35:39,536 --> 00:35:42,871
you're not helping to catch him,
you're encouraging him.

600
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:44,673
So, you're saying
there's a perpetrator?

601
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,407
Does he text you
when you're next?

602
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:50,211
Do you have any idea what that
girl's family is going through?

603
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:53,981
Yes, we've been in contact
with them through our blog.

604
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:56,284
They only want justice
for their daughter.

605
00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:59,454
We were on Prom Committee
and on Cheer Squad together.

606
00:35:59,456 --> 00:36:02,657
They asked us both to speak
at her memorial service.

607
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:05,293
We all need to find
a way to grieve.

608
00:36:05,295 --> 00:36:09,498
And remembering Syl's spirit
on the Internet is part of that.

609
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,166
Thank you for your time, girls.

610
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:12,700
Thank you.

611
00:36:12,702 --> 00:36:17,673
I need you both to account
for your whereabouts last night.

612
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,476
- I was with Sadie.
- Watching a movie.

613
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:21,809
With Jordan Welch.

614
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,019
This is un-fucking
acceptable, Gerald.

615
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,956
They're jeopardizing
the whole investigation.

616
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,791
Well, if you want to police
these kids on Twitter,

617
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:39,394
be my guest.

618
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:11,059
And a big thanks
to Jordan Welch

619
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:13,427
for putting that together
under such short notice.

620
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:15,831
Jordan.

621
00:37:19,603 --> 00:37:21,369
She will be missed.

622
00:37:21,371 --> 00:37:25,840
Also, I hope that I can fill
her shoes as cheer captain.

623
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:27,208
For more information,
or to donate

624
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,476
to a charity in Syl's name,

625
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:31,012
you can visit our blog
at Tragedy Girls...

626
00:37:31,014 --> 00:37:33,514
I got something to say.

627
00:37:33,516 --> 00:37:35,983
Um...

628
00:37:35,985 --> 00:37:37,853
Big Al, everyone.

629
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,358
Thank you, ladies.

630
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,862
You all know me.

631
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,963
I've been a firefighter
in this community

632
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:50,566
for eight years,

633
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,166
fire marshal for two,

634
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:54,403
not to mention going to state
handball championships

635
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,873
three years running,
right here in this very gym.

636
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:01,242
87-39...
record still stands.

637
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:03,744
I know what's happening
in this town.

638
00:38:03,746 --> 00:38:05,546
And these girls are right.

639
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:07,682
Someone is targeting our kids!

640
00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:10,818
And the sheriff's department
is not doing enough about it.

641
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,889
We have to stand up
for our community

642
00:38:14,891 --> 00:38:16,557
and find who's responsible.

643
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:19,494
If that means myself
and some volunteers

644
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:22,331
are searching every block,
every abandoned property

645
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,900
to find the guy
that's out there doing this,

646
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,901
we will,
and that's a promise!

647
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:28,804
That's what I'm talking
about, Big Al!

648
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:40,382
Can you believe he just stole
the mic from us like that?

649
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,050
I know, right?

650
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:44,452
Dick. So hot, though.

651
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:45,887
So hot.

652
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:49,057
My, uh, smoke alarm
is broken again.

653
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:50,892
That's very dangerous,
Mrs. Kent.

654
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:53,028
Mm-hmm.

655
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,367
Not too much,
or he might smell it.

656
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:02,070
Shit!

657
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:05,240
- Watch out, M-Kay!
- Why do we have to do this?

658
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,842
Why can't we just hit him
with an ax or something?

659
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,878
Because he's huge, and he's
probably expecting someone

660
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,345
to attack him.

661
00:39:11,347 --> 00:39:13,617
We've got another bottle
in the car.

662
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:18,452
She's not like you.

663
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:21,990
Whatever, Hannibal.

664
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:25,059
She makes little plans.

665
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:28,496
Always bossing you around.

666
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:32,400
Now you, you...
you're more like me.

667
00:39:34,103 --> 00:39:36,905
What the fuck
are you talking about?

668
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,775
Ask yourself...

669
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,978
who really takes all the risk?

670
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,615
Who really wants the kill?

671
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,249
Hmm?

672
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:51,153
No, without you,
she's, um, nothing.

673
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,824
No, Sadie and I are like
the same person.

674
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,793
She orders you around.

675
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:00,295
Not always.

676
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:04,166
She'll take all the credit,
you know,

677
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:08,836
just like the desperate
little fan girl that she is.

678
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:10,706
You can't trust her.

679
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,711
- What am I supposed to do?
- Just release me,

680
00:40:16,713 --> 00:40:21,316
and we'll kill everybody
that gets in our way.

681
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:32,394
It's okay.

682
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:36,401
Just... Just open the door,
McKayla.

683
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:40,101
Okay.

684
00:40:45,842 --> 00:40:47,775
Oh, my God, Lowell.

685
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:49,711
This is kind of sad, bro.

686
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:53,548
Like you could ever get
in between me and my BFF.

687
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,684
You know I'm right.

688
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:57,452
Before this is over,

689
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:59,987
she'll betray you.

690
00:41:07,463 --> 00:41:11,465
Oh, Big Al, you're so big!

691
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:12,967
Thank you, Mrs. Kent.

692
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:15,503
I just love
your big, meaty hands!

693
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:18,173
Is that what she sounds like?

694
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,608
I don't know.

695
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,976
I feel like
she would be like, "Ooh!"

696
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:23,478
I feel like her laugh
is like a "hoo."

697
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,414
Like a "hoo-hoo-hoo hoo hoo!"

698
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,157
Hi.

699
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,561
Keep in touch
with the fire station,

700
00:41:40,563 --> 00:41:42,930
I don't want a bunch of those
"heroes" forming a mob.

701
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:47,202
- Sheriff, uh, you got a minute?
- Make it quick, son.

702
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,903
Look, I know that
you don't like them,

703
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:51,606
but Sadie and McKayla have found
some really good patterns...

704
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:53,041
Not this again.

705
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,376
Can you at least
take a look at it?

706
00:41:55,378 --> 00:41:57,579
Because of their bullshit,
I'm working 'round the clock

707
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,981
to keep this town
from going crazy.

708
00:41:59,983 --> 00:42:02,117
Go home.

709
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,952
Can we talk?

710
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:12,293
Okay, look, I've been
editing their blog

711
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:13,695
for a couple weeks now,
and I feel like,

712
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,664
if you just took a look
at it once, then...

713
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:19,367
Jordan, I think about
your mom every day.

714
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:21,635
But this is not the same.

715
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:24,106
Finding this guy
does not bring her back.

716
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:25,807
And you running around,
spreading lies

717
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:29,677
with that Cunningham girl
does not honor her memory.

718
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,545
Understand?

719
00:42:31,547 --> 00:42:33,815
I just want you
to listen to me.

720
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,887
We're not done here.

721
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:58,472
Dude, finish strong!
Finish strong! One more!

722
00:42:58,474 --> 00:43:01,041
Yeah!

723
00:43:01,043 --> 00:43:03,644
Whoo! Good job, boy!

724
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:05,079
- Aw.
- Yeah!

725
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:06,780
Come on.

726
00:43:06,782 --> 00:43:09,851
Damn, you've been really
working out, huh?

727
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,686
Good job, good job, man.
You're good to cut the lights

728
00:43:11,688 --> 00:43:13,088
and lock the door
when I get out, right?

729
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,222
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right, cool.

730
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:15,523
Let me get ya,
let me get ya.

731
00:43:15,525 --> 00:43:16,758
All right.
Thanks, Drew.

732
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,360
No problem.

733
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,028
Whoo, Big Al!

734
00:43:25,735 --> 00:43:27,501
Perfect.

735
00:43:27,503 --> 00:43:29,604
Okay, so remember
the safe word is "torso."

736
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:32,039
Dude, I know. You told me
like a million times.

737
00:43:44,554 --> 00:43:47,188
Oof.

738
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,856
Oof.

739
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,429
Nice one!

740
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,666
But you should use
the other mirror.

741
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,633
It's got, like,
way better lighting.

742
00:43:59,635 --> 00:44:02,737
Hey, um, I think
they're closed.

743
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:04,371
Yeah, I know, I just saw
what's-his-name

744
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:06,374
and he was like,
"You can get in a quick 30."

745
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:07,909
Pump some iron,
as long as I've got

746
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:11,780
this big strong muscle-y Al
to take care of me!

747
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,981
Yeah, well,
I'm just finishing up, so...

748
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:16,383
Yeah, no, that's fine.
I'm just gonna, um,

749
00:44:16,385 --> 00:44:18,920
I'm just gonna do
a couple, like, sets.

750
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:21,889
You know what I mean?
Like, for my body.

751
00:44:21,891 --> 00:44:25,659
I've never seen you
in here before.

752
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:28,729
You know what, I was thinking,
like, the same thing.

753
00:44:28,731 --> 00:44:30,465
I was like, "Wow,
it's weird," right?

754
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:31,800
Like, I'm here all the time.

755
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:34,903
I mean, like, so are you,
obviously.

756
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,737
Oh, I'm such a klutz.

757
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:38,206
Oh, hey,
don't worry about that.

758
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,441
No, no, no,
let me refill it for you.

759
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,008
No, really,
I'm about to leave...

760
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,043
I insist.

761
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,095
Big bottle.

762
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,972
Shit.

763
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,740
Here you go.

764
00:45:12,742 --> 00:45:14,976
Thank you.
You didn't have to do that.

765
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,443
Yeah.

766
00:45:16,445 --> 00:45:20,581
Um, so, do you have any,
I don't know, like, tips...

767
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:24,385
for a girl who's trying to...
tighten?

768
00:45:24,387 --> 00:45:25,854
Tighten up.
Well, for your build,

769
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,988
you might want to start
with more free weights.

770
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,791
Free weights. Cool.
Yeah, no, good. Good idea. Ooh.

771
00:45:30,793 --> 00:45:34,431
- How about that?
- Hmm.

772
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:39,266
Mmm. Water. Mmm.

773
00:45:39,268 --> 00:45:43,003
Ah! So refreshing. Mmm.

774
00:45:43,005 --> 00:45:44,972
Mmm.

775
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:50,612
You okay?

776
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:53,180
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

777
00:45:53,182 --> 00:45:54,816
Someone's here.

778
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,950
- I didn't hear anything.
- I did.

779
00:45:56,952 --> 00:46:00,454
- Maybe we should hydrate. Oh.
- Stay here.

780
00:46:00,456 --> 00:46:02,222
Do you want to
take this with you?

781
00:46:02,224 --> 00:46:04,025
Somebody back here?

782
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,818
What are you doing?

783
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,555
Sorry about that.
Can't be too careful,

784
00:46:34,557 --> 00:46:36,590
especially with a nut-job
on the loose.

785
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No worries.
So, you want me to spot you?

786
00:46:47,103 --> 00:46:48,369
What the hell?

787
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:50,003
Dude! I said I got this!

788
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:53,240
Sorry! Torso! Torso!

789
00:46:53,242 --> 00:46:54,742
Ugh!

790
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:56,543
Call the police!

791
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:03,184
You bitches crazy!

792
00:48:10,052 --> 00:48:13,220
Well, at least this won't
look like an accident.

793
00:48:13,222 --> 00:48:15,389
Dude.
I totally had it.

794
00:48:15,391 --> 00:48:17,291
He drank the water
and everything.

795
00:48:17,293 --> 00:48:19,260
Jordan's on his way to my
house, like, right now.

796
00:48:19,262 --> 00:48:20,728
- We need to go.
- Okay, fine,

797
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,563
but you're not hearing
the last of this, okay?

798
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:24,499
I've got a lot
to talk to you about.

799
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:26,034
You always have a lot
to talk to me about.

800
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:28,101
I've got notes, girl.
I've got notes.

801
00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:58,768
Hey J. What's up?

802
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:03,170
My dad left his work
computer logged in,

803
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:07,441
so I copied the police reports,
crime-scene photos,

804
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:10,278
and documents
from all six murders.

805
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,949
- This is amazing.
- Yeah. It's, uh, super-illegal.

806
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:16,117
So...

807
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,289
You did this for me?

808
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:22,789
- Your dad would, like, freak out.
- Don't worry about him.

809
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:24,559
Look, I know
telling you to let it go

810
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,260
only seems to spur you on...

811
00:49:26,262 --> 00:49:29,396
so, uh, fuck it.

812
00:49:29,398 --> 00:49:31,199
I'm all in.

813
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,068
You're such a good friend, J.

814
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:41,575
Whoa, look at that
splatter pattern.

815
00:49:41,577 --> 00:49:43,845
- Yeah. That's...
- How awesome is that?

816
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Yeah. It's really...
It's really great.
- That's crazy.
- We can...
We can turn this off anytime.
Anytime we want, really.
I like them.

817
00:50:28,023 --> 00:50:30,325
Come in.

818
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,092
Hey, sunshine.

819
00:50:32,094 --> 00:50:34,963
Oh, you shouldn't have
let me sleep in.

820
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:38,432
I have to be ready for school.

821
00:50:38,434 --> 00:50:40,168
School's canceled today, hon.

822
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,936
Look, I don't know
how to say this,

823
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:44,738
so I'm just gonna say it.

824
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:47,110
There's been another murder.

825
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:50,612
What?!

826
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,782
The body of
decorated firefighter

827
00:50:55,784 --> 00:50:57,818
Albert "Big Al" Hill
was discovered

828
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,222
earlier this morning
by his longtime trainer.

829
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,891
Your friend of 20 years
found brutally murdered

830
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:06,760
in the one place that you
were supposed to feel safe.

831
00:51:06,762 --> 00:51:08,996
Will you ever look
at the gym the same?

832
00:51:08,998 --> 00:51:11,365
There's a hole in my heart
where Al used to live.

833
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:13,333
- Honey?
- Yeah.

834
00:51:13,335 --> 00:51:16,670
- Another murder! Town meeting.
- Okay.

835
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:18,840
We have to find a way
to remember Al.

836
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:21,943
We have to find a way
to remember Al!

837
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,278
We at Channel 5 remember Al,

838
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,347
and we are asking you,
if we don't start yielding

839
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:29,182
to the warning signs
of our local hero,

840
00:51:29,184 --> 00:51:31,719
who will be next?
Back to you.

841
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:34,354
He had gotten so strong.
So strong.

842
00:51:34,356 --> 00:51:35,956
Are we still live?

843
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:37,925
You know, Big Al was
the toughest S.O.B. I ever met.

844
00:51:37,927 --> 00:51:40,561
Cracked my tooth once
playing handball.

845
00:51:40,563 --> 00:51:41,963
- Steven...
- I'm just saying,

846
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,898
the guy was kind of a hot head.

847
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,900
Really surprised they
made him fire marshal.

848
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,668
Well, there's an emergency
town-hall meeting

849
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,302
this afternoon.
Now, baby,

850
00:51:49,304 --> 00:51:51,238
you don't have to go
if you don't want to.

851
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,376
I, um, I'm still trying
to process this.

852
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,311
But I think I'll be there.

853
00:51:57,313 --> 00:52:00,581
McKayla, I do not want you out
by yourself at night anymore.

854
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:01,782
It's too dangerous.

855
00:52:01,784 --> 00:52:03,351
But I still have
Prom Committee.

856
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:04,985
I won't go
anywhere without Sadie.

857
00:52:04,987 --> 00:52:07,454
We'll keep each other safe.

858
00:52:07,456 --> 00:52:08,822
Please?

859
00:52:08,824 --> 00:52:10,724
But I want
regular text updates.

860
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:12,392
Yes.

861
00:52:12,394 --> 00:52:13,728
That's my girl.

862
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,130
Waffle me.

863
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,199
Thank you, baby.

864
00:52:25,974 --> 00:52:29,443
Please, please.
Can I have your attention?

865
00:52:29,445 --> 00:52:32,746
Our town, our community,

866
00:52:32,748 --> 00:52:36,284
our entire way of life
is under attack.

867
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:40,088
We will overcome this,
but we must have faith.

868
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,490
We must have patience
with our law enforcement

869
00:52:43,492 --> 00:52:45,059
and with each other.

870
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:49,063
This is a time for remembering,
for mourning.

871
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,965
And now I'd like
to turn the floor over

872
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:53,900
to Sheriff Welch, if you please.

873
00:52:53,902 --> 00:52:56,037
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

874
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,972
I'd like to stress to everybody

875
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:01,141
that the most important
thing to do is stay calm

876
00:53:01,143 --> 00:53:04,345
and not make our community
even more vulnerable.

877
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:07,615
I've consulted with
the state police and the FBI.

878
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,217
And with their help,

879
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,952
a strict curfew of 8:00 p.m.
will be in effect.

880
00:53:22,931 --> 00:53:24,999
Son of a bitch!

881
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:31,572
- Please, remain calm.
- Curfews can't keep us safe!

882
00:53:31,574 --> 00:53:33,273
What are you hiding, Sheriff?

883
00:53:33,275 --> 00:53:36,677
- What about our missing pets?
- This is exactly what he wants!

884
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:39,079
Hashtag RememberAl!
RememberAl!

885
00:53:39,081 --> 00:53:40,481
Remember Al!
Remember Al!

886
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:43,117

Remember Al! Remember Al!

891
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:12,780
Hyah!

892
00:54:24,693 --> 00:54:27,195
Okay!

893
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:32,766
Who's ready to show this psycho
that we are not afraid?!

894
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:35,869
- We are!
- Right!

895
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:38,039
Let's march down Main Street

896
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:41,175
and give Sheriff Welch
a piece of our mind!

897
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:44,211
- Yeah!
- Remember Al!

898
00:54:44,213 --> 00:54:47,380
Remember Al! Remember Al!

899
00:54:47,382 --> 00:54:52,552
Remember Al! Remember Al!
Remember Al! Remember Al!

900
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:59,726
Ugh. I feel like we've been
walking for fucking hours.

901
00:54:59,728 --> 00:55:04,599
My calves are killing me, and
we're only a third of the way.

902
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,068
Ugh. Damn it!

903
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,704
Who are you texting?

904
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:14,242
No one. Come on, let's go
to the front for a better shot.

905
00:55:17,646 --> 00:55:19,914
Excuse me. Pardon me.

906
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,391
And with a show of force
and goodwill like this,

907
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,693
- one thing is certain.
- Our Midwestern town

908
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,429
won't take any more shit
from this serial killer.

909
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:14,635
Like and favorite!

910
00:56:30,585 --> 00:56:32,153
Did you...

911
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:34,387
I was with you the whole time.

912
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,565
Excuse me!

913
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,932
Sadie, McKayla.

914
00:56:45,934 --> 00:56:47,668
Quick sound bite
from the Tragedy Girls?

915
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:50,271
Oh, I can't even deal
with this right now.

916
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,905
Uh, we are shocked and saddened

917
00:56:51,907 --> 00:56:53,273
that another death
has transpired

918
00:56:53,275 --> 00:56:55,508
due to the apathy
of our law enforcement.

919
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:57,244
- Good one.
- Is that a direct quote?

920
00:56:57,246 --> 00:56:58,813
Hey, wait your turn!
Are you afraid that the killer

921
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,947
will target you next
because of your infamous blog?

922
00:57:00,949 --> 00:57:05,720
Um, we will not rest until
we stop this menace of society!

923
00:57:10,425 --> 00:57:12,193
Please continue to follow
Tragedy Girls on Twitter.

924
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:13,760
Excuse me. Thank you.

925
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,298
- Yeah?
- Hey, hon.

926
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,967
A lot of people
have been calling the house...

927
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:23,704
- CNN, ABC, Barbara Walters.
- Sweetie,

928
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,005
there's someone who calls

929
00:57:25,007 --> 00:57:26,440
who just breathes
into the phone.

930
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:28,108
Mom, Dad,
just hang up the phone.

931
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:31,644
Don't talk to anyone.
And lock the doors.

932
00:57:31,646 --> 00:57:33,914
What if it's him?

933
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:36,416
There's a good chance.

934
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:38,818
So, you believe
you're being followed?

935
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:41,287
I've been getting these weird
texts, like when I'm at school.

936
00:57:41,289 --> 00:57:42,889
Someone's been
invading my privacy.

937
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:44,325
- I know it.
- And I'm pretty sure

938
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,226
- I've seen this guy before.
- He could be the killer.

939
00:57:46,228 --> 00:57:48,729
- He was old.
- Not like <i>you</i> old,

940
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,032
like Father Time old,
but, like, old.

941
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:53,767
- Kind of out of shape, um...
- 6'6".

942
00:57:53,769 --> 00:57:56,070
- And really old.
- Something like this?

943
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:01,075
This looks like
Stewie from "Family Guy."

944
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,575
That's terrible, but, yeah.

945
00:58:02,577 --> 00:58:04,744
Yeah, his eyes were
a little bit more beady.

946
00:58:04,746 --> 00:58:08,115
- You should hire somebody.
- Do you think you could, like,

947
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,351
dispatch someone to,
like, my house?

948
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:12,153
Or escort me to school,
just in case?

949
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:16,222
Even with all the extra help,
I can't spare a single deputy.

950
00:58:16,224 --> 00:58:18,159
- What?
- The fuck? You're the police.

951
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,760
I could be killed!

952
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:23,229
Maybe stop checking
in your location online,

953
00:58:23,231 --> 00:58:26,400
and he won't find you.

954
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:29,670
I'd rather die.

955
00:58:33,509 --> 00:58:34,775
Phones off!

956
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,309
But it's a matter
of life and death.

957
00:58:36,311 --> 00:58:38,912
What if we have to call 911?

958
00:58:38,914 --> 00:58:40,414
I said, phones off!

959
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,987
You know, maybe we should
continue with a conversation

960
00:58:47,989 --> 00:58:50,858
about the dark side
of social media.

961
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,793
Anyone?

962
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:57,534
Narcissism?
What about shallowness?

963
00:58:59,534 --> 00:59:01,168
Sociopathy?

964
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,771
- I object!
- Yeah, you're singling us out.

965
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:08,541
People have died!
People who can't be replaced.

966
00:59:08,543 --> 00:59:11,711
I have just about had it
with the both of you,

967
00:59:11,713 --> 00:59:15,115
feeding off misery
like parasites.

968
00:59:15,117 --> 00:59:18,151
You should both be ashamed.

969
00:59:18,153 --> 00:59:21,057
Parasitic.

970
00:59:32,434 --> 00:59:34,735
- I can't do this anymore.
- You're just going to quit?

971
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,302
You can't just
abandon our videos.

972
00:59:36,304 --> 00:59:37,871
We gave you all the footage.

973
00:59:37,873 --> 00:59:41,275
- You can have it back.
- I thought we made a good team.

974
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:43,510
We do.
I... My dad needs me

975
00:59:43,512 --> 00:59:45,045
more than you guys right now.

976
00:59:45,047 --> 00:59:46,280
- Fuck your dad.
- M-Kay!

977
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:47,815
Don't talk about
my dad like that.

978
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,883
No. If Sheriff Welch
knew his dick from his donuts,

979
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:52,353
he would've solved this already.
He's useless.

980
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:53,987
Just like when your mother
was murdered.

981
00:59:53,989 --> 00:59:55,255
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

982
00:59:55,257 --> 00:59:57,423
That's enough!

983
00:59:57,425 --> 01:00:00,661
Come on, Sadie.
We don't need him.

984
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:05,633
We could Snapchat a used tampon
and it would be huge.

985
01:00:19,648 --> 01:00:22,749
- Jordan needs to die.
- He's harmless.

986
01:00:22,751 --> 01:00:24,251
He's making you soft.

987
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:26,920
I am not soft.
I am fierce.

988
01:00:26,922 --> 01:00:29,490
And you shouldn't have
brought up his mom.

989
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:31,124
Are you still feeling guilty
about that shit?

990
01:00:31,126 --> 01:00:33,026
Hey, girls.

991
01:00:33,028 --> 01:00:35,628
If you hear anything weird,
don't hesitate.

992
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,664
No psychos are gonna get
in here on my watch.

993
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:39,599
- Yes, Dad.
- Yes, Mr. Cunningham.

994
01:00:39,601 --> 01:00:43,304
All right,
I'm gonna hit the hay. Night.

995
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,572
Jordan knows more
than he's letting on.

996
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:46,139
He doesn't know anything.

997
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:48,275
Dude, the way
he was looking at me.

998
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,010
He's always hanging around,
watching.

999
01:00:50,012 --> 01:00:52,979
It's only a matter of time
before he spills to his dad.

1000
01:00:52,981 --> 01:00:54,682
You're over-reacting.

1001
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,016
Fuck.

1002
01:00:57,018 --> 01:00:59,353
- What?
- My phone.

1003
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,655
My fucking phone.

1004
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:04,258
- Which one?
- The important one.

1005
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,293
I swear it was right...

1006
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,829
He took it.

1007
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,465
Jordan?
You're being paranoid.

1008
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:12,833
Earlier, with the drive.

1009
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,767
I mean, right in front
of my fucking face.

1010
01:01:14,769 --> 01:01:17,804
This is like a total breach!
He dies tonight!

1011
01:01:17,806 --> 01:01:19,740
Lowell could be outside,
figuring out

1012
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:21,407
how to disembowel us
or whatever.

1013
01:01:21,409 --> 01:01:24,445
- It's not even worth the risk.
- If we go to jail,

1014
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:27,584
everything
that we've worked for is fucked.

1015
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:31,651
Look, don't worry. okay?

1016
01:01:31,653 --> 01:01:34,387
I'll sneak into his house
after curfew,

1017
01:01:34,389 --> 01:01:36,289
and I'll slit his throat.

1018
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:38,025
It'll be quick...

1019
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,293
like it never even happened.

1020
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:43,863
No, he's my friend.

1021
01:01:43,865 --> 01:01:46,099
I'll do it.

1022
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:05,686
Are you, uh, going back
to the station again?

1023
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:09,856
No, figure
I'll stay in tonight.

1024
01:02:09,858 --> 01:02:13,193
We got some extra guys
from Chamberlain on shift.

1025
01:02:13,195 --> 01:02:15,695
They've got it under control.

1026
01:02:15,697 --> 01:02:18,298
We'll have some fun.

1027
01:03:06,414 --> 01:03:08,481
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1028
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:10,450
What the hell
are you doing here?

1029
01:03:10,452 --> 01:03:11,851
I wanted to see you,

1030
01:03:11,853 --> 01:03:13,487
but I didn't think
your dad would be here.

1031
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:16,657
He will freak out
if he catches you.

1032
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:19,525
Is that an Elvis Presley frog?

1033
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:21,461
Goddamn right, it's
an Elvis Presley frog.

1034
01:03:21,463 --> 01:03:22,595
"You ain't nothing
but a hound frog."

1035
01:03:22,597 --> 01:03:23,996
That's it.

1036
01:03:23,998 --> 01:03:25,532
Are we gonna talk,
or did you just come over

1037
01:03:25,534 --> 01:03:27,333
- to make fun of me?
- Sorry.

1038
01:03:27,335 --> 01:03:30,537
It's just exactly
how I pictured it.

1039
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:33,807
And how did you
avoid the deputies?

1040
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:37,411
I didn't, really.
They're just bad at their jobs.

1041
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:39,746
They've never been fantastic.

1042
01:03:39,748 --> 01:03:42,084
It's like a thousand degrees
in here.

1043
01:03:43,818 --> 01:03:46,753
Um, um, listen,

1044
01:03:46,755 --> 01:03:49,088
there's something
that I have to tell you.

1045
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:50,490
Come on, you got this.

1046
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:52,492
I have something
I need to tell you, too.

1047
01:03:52,494 --> 01:03:56,295
Okay.
Um, you want to go first?

1048
01:03:56,297 --> 01:03:58,365
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1049
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,566
- You go.
- Okay.

1050
01:04:00,568 --> 01:04:04,905
Um, something McKayla said
the other day...

1051
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:09,242
My mom's death has
never been ruled a murder.

1052
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:13,746
What are you saying?

1053
01:04:13,748 --> 01:04:16,883
I'm saying that I think
she knows more than she lets on,

1054
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:21,722
about what's happening,
about who's killing people.

1055
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:25,525
But she was just a kid
when your mom passed away.

1056
01:04:25,527 --> 01:04:28,662
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I-I know it sounds crazy,

1057
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:31,231
and I know that you want
to protect her,

1058
01:04:31,233 --> 01:04:34,700
but maybe she knows the killer.

1059
01:04:34,702 --> 01:04:37,438
What makes you say that?

1060
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,873
Okay, the morning
after Syl's death,

1061
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:41,809
she had splatter stains
on her shoes.

1062
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:45,112
And to be fair, I didn't get
a good look at it, but...

1063
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,014
Oh, you'll get
a good look at it.

1064
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:49,615
In the town meeting,
she sent a text, like,

1065
01:04:49,617 --> 01:04:52,619
right before everyone got
a picture of Big Al dead.

1066
01:04:52,621 --> 01:04:55,088
People text all the time.

1067
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:58,057
Okay. All right?

1068
01:04:58,059 --> 01:05:00,793
Does everyone have

1069
01:05:00,795 --> 01:05:03,831
a second unregistered
cellphone in their backpack?

1070
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,666
- I fucking knew it!
- What?

1071
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:09,536
- Yeah.
- What did you see on it?

1072
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:10,871
Nothing yet. It's locked,

1073
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:13,941
and I haven't finished
cracking it.

1074
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:15,441
I probably shouldn't be
telling you this,

1075
01:05:15,443 --> 01:05:17,677
but I kind of broke
into the school

1076
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:19,612
and I got her psych profile

1077
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:20,914
while everyone
was doing the march.

1078
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:23,182
- Those are private!
- I know, I know,

1079
01:05:23,184 --> 01:05:25,184
I must seem insane right now,
but I think

1080
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:27,354
there might be something
seriously wrong with her.

1081
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:29,623
She's got, like,
a lot of red flags.

1082
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,458
That doesn't mean anything.

1083
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,927
Just stop defending her, okay?

1084
01:05:34,929 --> 01:05:36,463
Look, if she has something
to do with this,

1085
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,231
or if she's working
with someone,

1086
01:05:38,233 --> 01:05:40,733
I think they might be
ramping up to something big.

1087
01:05:40,735 --> 01:05:43,704
- You're being crazy, J.
- No, I just...

1088
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:45,104
I know what it's like

1089
01:05:45,106 --> 01:05:47,106
to lose someone
that you really care about.

1090
01:05:47,108 --> 01:05:49,208
And I don't know

1091
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:52,012
if I could live with myself
if anything happened to you.

1092
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:55,414
You don't mean that.

1093
01:05:55,416 --> 01:05:58,084
No, I do.
I mean, I think

1094
01:05:58,086 --> 01:06:02,655
you're pretty much
the most amazing, brilliant,

1095
01:06:02,657 --> 01:06:05,691
unique person I've ever met.

1096
01:06:05,693 --> 01:06:08,461
- Really?
- Yeah.

1097
01:06:08,463 --> 01:06:11,798
I think you're special.
To me, at least.

1098
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,200
And you have really good taste
in obscure movies,

1099
01:06:14,202 --> 01:06:17,503
and, like,
your hair is, like, super cool.

1100
01:06:17,505 --> 01:06:19,238
And I...

1101
01:06:21,543 --> 01:06:24,978
Ugh. Vom.

1102
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:33,452
Lehmann?!

1103
01:06:33,454 --> 01:06:35,956
- Did you hear that?
- No, what?

1104
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:37,791
Listen.

1105
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:40,293
Shit.

1106
01:06:40,295 --> 01:06:42,564
Uh, one second, Dad.

1107
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,632
Shh!

1108
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,470
What the...

1109
01:06:58,179 --> 01:07:01,048
Jordan!

1110
01:07:07,322 --> 01:07:10,190
Aaaah!

1111
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:20,099
Shit!

1112
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:26,106
Aaah!

1113
01:07:41,422 --> 01:07:43,090
Aaaah!

1114
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:56,235
Jordan.

1115
01:07:56,237 --> 01:07:58,604
Hold on there, son.

1116
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,709
What you doing here?

1117
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,012
She saved my life.

1118
01:08:06,014 --> 01:08:08,949
Thank you.

1119
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:12,351
Yes, uh, I need an ambulance
at 461 Cedar Lane.

1120
01:08:12,353 --> 01:08:15,589
We have one person bleeding
from a large knife wound.

1121
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:30,437
In the two weeks since
the attack at my home,

1122
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:31,705
there have been no new sightings

1123
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:34,141
of the so-called
Rosedale Ripper.

1124
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:37,376
I'd like to acknowledge
the bravery and forthrightness

1125
01:08:37,378 --> 01:08:40,781
of Rosedale's
very own Sadie Cunningham.

1126
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,753
Sadie!

1127
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:50,523
I was humbled to witness
her courage firsthand

1128
01:08:50,525 --> 01:08:54,193
as she fought off her attacker.

1129
01:08:54,195 --> 01:08:58,764
I am eternally indebted to you
for saving my son's life.

1130
01:09:01,136 --> 01:09:03,903
Go, Sadie!

1131
01:09:03,905 --> 01:09:06,238
Hi. Trish, Channel 5.
I just want to know,

1132
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,541
what's next for
the Tragedy Girl?

1133
01:09:08,543 --> 01:09:10,576
Uh, actually, it's...

1134
01:09:10,578 --> 01:09:12,411
I mean...

1135
01:09:12,413 --> 01:09:16,215
I'm going to continue
to fight for what's right

1136
01:09:16,217 --> 01:09:19,452
and really work to make
the community a safer place.

1137
01:09:19,454 --> 01:09:21,321
You know?

1138
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:32,232
Madam President,
can I speak to you for a moment?

1139
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,871
Sure.

1140
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:40,307
- What's up, M-Kay?
- We need to talk.

1141
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:43,910
- Not now. We're at school.
- Who cares?!

1142
01:09:43,912 --> 01:09:47,013
Lower your voice.
They're watching me.

1143
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:49,715
Bitch, you love it.

1144
01:09:49,717 --> 01:09:52,952
I saw you
up there on that podium.

1145
01:09:52,954 --> 01:09:55,388
What, are you jelly?

1146
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:57,324
I am so not jelly.

1147
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,526
Is this about
the Tragedy Girl thing?

1148
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:04,030
Look at you, dude.

1149
01:10:04,032 --> 01:10:06,866
Hooking up with that loser
out of pity.

1150
01:10:06,868 --> 01:10:09,503
See, I thought you were
the one with the plan.

1151
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:11,804
The vision? A night to remember?

1152
01:10:11,806 --> 01:10:14,508
Not just cut and run
when shit gets real.

1153
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:18,911
Okay, last I checked, it was me
who had to mop up your mess.

1154
01:10:18,913 --> 01:10:20,312
We'll discuss this later.

1155
01:10:20,314 --> 01:10:22,081
We wouldn't have
a mess to mop up,

1156
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:24,451
had you had the guts to...

1157
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:26,820
had you had the guts

1158
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:29,822
to buy the gold balloons
like we had talked about.

1159
01:10:29,824 --> 01:10:32,058
See, I for one,
don't want my prom

1160
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:34,294
to look like the inside
of your ratchet-ass trailer.

1161
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:39,165
You're such a cliché!

1162
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:41,134
Don't blame me because
your part of our plan

1163
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:43,202
is always boring and uninspired.

1164
01:10:43,204 --> 01:10:45,805
Okay, there is nothing special
about what you do!

1165
01:10:45,807 --> 01:10:47,240
You only hold me back!

1166
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:49,843
Well, I've never needed you.

1167
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:52,678
We don't need you.

1168
01:10:57,118 --> 01:10:59,885
Fuck you, Sades.

1169
01:10:59,887 --> 01:11:02,988
Fuck these stupid fucking stars!

1170
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:06,962
What the fuck
are you looking at?!

1171
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,599
What?!

1172
01:13:03,478 --> 01:13:05,111
Uh, hi, Mr. Cunningham.

1173
01:13:05,113 --> 01:13:08,083
Uh, just here to pick up Sadie.

1174
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:12,121
Uh, uh, J-Jordan.

1175
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:15,120
Jordan Welch.

1176
01:13:15,122 --> 01:13:18,625
Uh, we've met a couple times.

1177
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:21,695
My dad's the... sheriff.

1178
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:26,665
Uh, one time in middle school,
you told me, like,

1179
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:29,102
"Stay away from my daughter."

1180
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:31,170
Uh, I'm here...
I'm here for prom.

1181
01:13:31,172 --> 01:13:33,606
- Um...
- Sadie!

1182
01:13:35,409 --> 01:13:38,445
It's a great house
you have here.

1183
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:41,481
- Hey.
- Hi.

1184
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:44,784
Uh, could we get a picture
real quick if that's okay?

1185
01:13:44,786 --> 01:13:47,355
There you go.

1186
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:51,590
You got to tap the screen.

1187
01:13:51,592 --> 01:13:54,027
It's just a little...
little tap on the screen.

1188
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:55,932
- Uh...
- Here.

1189
01:14:00,935 --> 01:14:02,768
That's great.

1190
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:05,905
- Dinner's in the fridge, Pop.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

1191
01:14:05,907 --> 01:14:08,474
Bring her home safe.

1192
01:14:08,476 --> 01:14:11,046
Yeah. Yes.

1193
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,754
There we go. Okay.

1194
01:14:21,756 --> 01:14:24,456
And...

1195
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,830
There we go.
It really is an art form.

1196
01:14:30,832 --> 01:14:34,134
Easing off the clutch.

1197
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,902
Ease off the clutch.

1198
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:40,173
Ease off the clutch!

1199
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:41,941
Prom! Prom!
Prom! Prom!

1200
01:14:41,943 --> 01:14:44,210
- Prom! Prom! Prom!
- Your ride's here!

1201
01:14:44,212 --> 01:14:45,745
Don't rush her.

1202
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:50,150
- Oh! Look at my baby girl!
- Aww, look at that girl!

1203
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,085
Angelica ain't got nothing
on my baby.

1204
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:53,553
Look at you.

1205
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:56,723
- Cut it out, guys.
- Oh, you only go to prom once.

1206
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:58,324
And I cannot believe
those boys at your school

1207
01:14:58,326 --> 01:14:59,726
were too afraid to ask you out.

1208
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:01,294
- Why you got to bring that up?
- I'm just saying,

1209
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:02,861
they shouldn't be afraid
of a beautiful woman.

1210
01:15:02,863 --> 01:15:04,731
Well, it's just, you know,
things got a little crazy,

1211
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:07,700
and there weren't a lot
of guys left to ask me.

1212
01:15:07,702 --> 01:15:09,736
Will Sadie be there?

1213
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:11,470
Yeah, I-I think so.

1214
01:15:11,472 --> 01:15:13,373
I'll tell her
that you guys said hi.

1215
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,075
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1216
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:17,076
I'll get the door.

1217
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:22,147
Rosedale High, please.

1218
01:15:22,149 --> 01:15:25,552
Yes, ma'am.

1219
01:15:59,386 --> 01:16:02,455
- Isn't this great?
- Sure.

1220
01:16:10,398 --> 01:16:12,098
I'm kind of thirsty.
I'll be right back.

1221
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:15,067
Okay.

1222
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:36,755
- Nice dress, Sadie.
- You too.

1223
01:16:36,757 --> 01:16:40,160
I want you to know
how proud I am.

1224
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:41,593
You really turned
your attitude around

1225
01:16:41,595 --> 01:16:44,097
in spite of everything
that's happened.

1226
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:47,599
- I guess a lot has changed.
- I hope you don't mind,

1227
01:16:47,601 --> 01:16:51,638
but I put your name forward
for a scholarship.

1228
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,040
Young women who
have overcome adversity.

1229
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:58,076
- Thanks, Mrs. K.
- You're welcome.

1230
01:16:58,078 --> 01:16:59,845
I think I need to go outside,
get some fresh air

1231
01:16:59,847 --> 01:17:02,382
before I lose it.
You have a good night.

1232
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:04,550
- You, as well.
- Okay.

1233
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:15,495
Hey! Come on, what you doing?
It's a great song.

1234
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:17,796
Just sitting for a bit.

1235
01:17:17,798 --> 01:17:21,668
Hey, look, um...

1236
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:26,104
I-I know that things haven't
really been the same for you

1237
01:17:26,106 --> 01:17:28,840
ever since we got together.

1238
01:17:28,842 --> 01:17:31,777
But I-I just want to
let you know I'm so sorry

1239
01:17:31,779 --> 01:17:34,479
for telling you all that shit
about McKayla.

1240
01:17:34,481 --> 01:17:36,316
I know she had nothing
to do with the murders.

1241
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,318
Like, s-she couldn't have.
That's insane.

1242
01:17:41,389 --> 01:17:43,423
Is there anything I can do
to make it up to you?

1243
01:17:45,159 --> 01:17:47,527
Hello? Hello?
Oh, there we go.

1244
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:51,196
- How you doing Rosedale High?!
- Yeah!

1245
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:54,400
Yeah! Whoo!

1246
01:17:54,402 --> 01:17:57,336
Okay, I'm just gonna say
a few words,

1247
01:17:57,338 --> 01:18:02,040
and then this boring old dude
will get offstage, I promise.

1248
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:05,111
To say that this was
a tough year

1249
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:08,180
would be
a massive understatement.

1250
01:18:08,182 --> 01:18:09,715
- Yeah.
- No shit.

1251
01:18:09,717 --> 01:18:12,151
But if there's one good thing
that we can take away

1252
01:18:12,153 --> 01:18:15,391
from these dark times,
it's this.

1253
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:19,459
Our friends.

1254
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:22,894
No matter where you go in life,

1255
01:18:22,896 --> 01:18:24,696
you will always have
with each other

1256
01:18:24,698 --> 01:18:29,669
a bond that is unbreakable.

1257
01:18:32,573 --> 01:18:34,507
I believe that the votes
have been tallied.

1258
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:36,709
Yes?

1259
01:18:40,448 --> 01:18:43,683
This year's king and queen

1260
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:46,251
are Jordan Welch
and Sadie Cunningham.

1261
01:18:50,024 --> 01:18:52,090
Dude!

1262
01:18:55,029 --> 01:18:57,196
What the...

1263
01:18:57,198 --> 01:18:58,964
Come on.

1264
01:18:58,966 --> 01:19:03,135
We will now commence the prom
king and queen's first dance.

1265
01:19:03,137 --> 01:19:05,405
All hail Jordan and Sadie.

1266
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:15,815
I can't believe
this is happening.

1267
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:21,353
- I think it's rigged.
- No, no, not just that.

1268
01:19:21,355 --> 01:19:25,958
We survived
not just a serial killer

1269
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,460
but high school.

1270
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:35,768
And now we're here.
And I just... I can't tell you

1271
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:39,371
how lucky I feel to share
this dance with my best friend.

1272
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:28,920
Jonathan and Tracey,
what are you doing out here?

1273
01:20:28,922 --> 01:20:31,324
Back inside. Now.

1274
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,425
- Yes, Mrs. Kent.
- Yes, Mrs. Kent.

1275
01:20:42,837 --> 01:20:44,937
Mrs. Kent.

1276
01:20:44,939 --> 01:20:47,339
Smoking can cause fires.

1277
01:20:47,341 --> 01:20:49,509
Or didn't Big Al teach you that?

1278
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,744
McKayla, what are you doing
out here?

1279
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, just waiting for a friend.
Speak of the devil.

1280
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,491
Jesus Christ.
McKayla!

1281
01:21:22,609 --> 01:21:25,311
- Why?
- Shh.

1282
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:26,646
Please raise your hand

1283
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:29,348
if you have something to say,
Mrs. Kent.

1284
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:41,460
Now?

1285
01:21:41,462 --> 01:21:43,463
No.

1286
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:45,998
I have an appearance to make.

1287
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,603
So, I know we haven't
gotten a chance

1288
01:21:51,605 --> 01:21:53,738
to talk about
when summer's over,

1289
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:55,741
but have you thought
about Kent State?

1290
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:57,375
I haven't really decided.

1291
01:21:57,377 --> 01:21:58,811
Because even if you went
with Ohio, like,

1292
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:01,680
we'd still be pretty close by.
That'd be cool.

1293
01:22:01,682 --> 01:22:03,583
- Jordan, listen...
- Hey, dude.

1294
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,284
Uh, one sec.

1295
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:34,580
Sadie?
You're so brave.

1296
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:36,848
I love you.

1297
01:22:39,453 --> 01:22:41,586
Get the fuck out of my face.

1298
01:22:45,059 --> 01:22:46,659
Yeah, but thanks.
I appreciate it.

1299
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:48,260
No problem.

1300
01:23:06,613 --> 01:23:08,446
M-Kay!

1301
01:23:32,439 --> 01:23:34,507
Hey.

1302
01:23:38,011 --> 01:23:41,282
McKayla, what'd you do
to Mrs. Kent?

1303
01:23:42,984 --> 01:23:45,617
She got what she deserved.

1304
01:23:50,257 --> 01:23:52,625
What do you think?

1305
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:54,059
Cute, right?

1306
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:56,928
M-Kay, you don't have
to prove anything to me.

1307
01:23:56,930 --> 01:24:00,165
We made a splash. That's enough.
Don't fuck up your future.

1308
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:03,402
Fuck up my future?

1309
01:24:03,404 --> 01:24:05,137
What happened to you?

1310
01:24:05,139 --> 01:24:07,772
We used to be the same,
you and me.

1311
01:24:07,774 --> 01:24:10,776
Do you remember our first time?

1312
01:24:10,778 --> 01:24:13,678
- M-Kay, don't.
- Don't what?

1313
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:16,115
I mean, it was your plan,
after all.

1314
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:19,652
Poor old bag didn't
even see it coming.

1315
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:23,656
One minute, she's driving two
girls home from dance practice.

1316
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:26,959
The next,
she's lying in a ditch.

1317
01:24:29,663 --> 01:24:32,831
Poor Mrs. Welch.

1318
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:37,637
- It was an accident.
- An accident?

1319
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:39,938
Is that what you tell yourself?

1320
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:42,942
Because we both wanted it!

1321
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:46,144
But, oh, you were the one
who was cold as ice.

1322
01:24:46,146 --> 01:24:51,784
I remember crying and crying
the next day...

1323
01:24:51,786 --> 01:24:55,553
jumping every time
the phone rang...

1324
01:24:55,555 --> 01:24:58,523
scared that I would blurt it
all out at the dinner table...

1325
01:25:01,929 --> 01:25:05,563
...that I would let down
my best friend.

1326
01:25:05,565 --> 01:25:07,532
And then you abandoned me?

1327
01:25:07,534 --> 01:25:11,370
I mean, you even became friends
with her son!

1328
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:13,738
Him over me!

1329
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:16,142
I thought I was going crazy!

1330
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:20,579
The old Sadie, she wasn't
like everybody else.

1331
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:27,119
No, she was something
real special.

1332
01:25:27,121 --> 01:25:30,289
And she would agree with me.

1333
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:33,526
But if you want to be dancing
under that spotlight

1334
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:36,995
with those fucking sheep,

1335
01:25:36,997 --> 01:25:40,700
then you're better off dead
with the rest of them.

1336
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:43,068
- I never meant to hurt you.
- Oh, please.

1337
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:44,836
I'm like, so over it.

1338
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:48,441
I believe you've already met
my prom date.

1339
01:25:54,247 --> 01:25:57,750
Been waiting a long time,
for this...

1340
01:25:57,752 --> 01:26:00,452
to gut you...

1341
01:26:00,454 --> 01:26:03,155
feast on your flesh.

1342
01:26:03,157 --> 01:26:06,291
Oh, scary, Lowell.
Nice.

1343
01:26:06,293 --> 01:26:08,760
See, he's not much
of a sweet talker,

1344
01:26:08,762 --> 01:26:11,464
but he knows how to
show a girl a good time.

1345
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:14,099
So, that's it?

1346
01:26:14,101 --> 01:26:17,236
You're just gonna
kill your best friend?

1347
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:21,272
Dude, no.
No, I'm here to save you.

1348
01:26:21,274 --> 01:26:24,442
We're gonna finish this
just like we planned.

1349
01:26:24,444 --> 01:26:26,711
A night to remember.

1350
01:26:26,713 --> 01:26:28,914
No!

1351
01:26:28,916 --> 01:26:30,482
Sadie, run! Hurry!

1352
01:26:30,484 --> 01:26:32,785
No!

1353
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,634
Come on, Jordan,
climbing up the stairs?

1354
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:50,602
It's like you want
to get caught.

1355
01:26:50,604 --> 01:26:52,370
Just like your mother.

1356
01:26:52,372 --> 01:26:54,205
Sadie, come to me, baby.

1357
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,843
Hey! Michael Myers knock-off!

1358
01:26:57,845 --> 01:27:00,146
I told you, she's off limits!

1359
01:27:00,148 --> 01:27:04,083
Did you think I'd forget
what you did to me?

1360
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:08,454
Chained, tortured, dog food?

1361
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:12,924
I'm gonna repay the favor until
you're begging me to kill you!

1362
01:27:12,926 --> 01:27:14,692
Lowell, calm down.

1363
01:27:14,694 --> 01:27:17,830
We both know that you're not
very good with the thinking,

1364
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:20,132
especially after
all the chloroform.

1365
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:22,835
You and I, we're the same,
remember?

1366
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:24,769
No.

1367
01:27:24,771 --> 01:27:27,238
You spend your life

1368
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:30,175
putting fake bullshit
on the Internet!

1369
01:27:30,177 --> 01:27:33,978
I'm gonna show you
what it really looks like!!

1370
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:36,714
Stay away from her!

1371
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:50,028
I missed you so much.

1372
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:52,464
Shut up.
I missed you so much!

1373
01:27:57,470 --> 01:27:59,170
Sadie.

1374
01:27:59,172 --> 01:28:02,074
Sadie, come here.
Sadie, get away from her.

1375
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:04,943
Get away from her.
We need to call the police.

1376
01:28:04,945 --> 01:28:07,646
You're gonna pay
for what you did.

1377
01:28:07,648 --> 01:28:11,016
Jordan, wait.

1378
01:28:11,018 --> 01:28:13,152
She's my best friend.

1379
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:16,655
She just tried to kill you!

1380
01:28:16,657 --> 01:28:18,223
And... And me!

1381
01:28:18,225 --> 01:28:22,061
She murdered my mom!
She...

1382
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:24,796
You ruined my life.

1383
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:29,401
So did I.

1384
01:28:29,403 --> 01:28:33,341
Sadie, no, no, no.
Listen to me.

1385
01:28:35,275 --> 01:28:38,843
I love you... the real you.

1386
01:28:38,845 --> 01:28:41,679
Come on,
you're nothing like her.

1387
01:28:41,681 --> 01:28:43,915
Oh, J.

1388
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,228
You don't know me at all.

1389
01:31:35,855 --> 01:31:38,456
Is my son in there?!

1390
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:41,692
No!

1391
01:31:41,694 --> 01:31:44,062
No!

1392
01:31:44,064 --> 01:31:46,397
I guess you were right.

1393
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:48,901
- Best night ever.
- Best night ever.

1394
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:57,843
No-o!

1395
01:32:03,516 --> 01:32:05,550
Months have passed since
the Rosedale Massacre

1396
01:32:05,552 --> 01:32:09,120
claimed the lives
of nearly 124 students.

1397
01:32:09,122 --> 01:32:11,990
But the healing
has only just begun.

1398
01:32:11,992 --> 01:32:15,760
From this moment,
I resign my post

1399
01:32:15,762 --> 01:32:17,228
as the sheriff of this community

1400
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:19,932
to focus on charity work

1401
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:22,701
in... my son's name.

1402
01:32:23,938 --> 01:32:26,170
Later in the hour,
we'll have new information

1403
01:32:26,172 --> 01:32:27,705
on Lowell Orson Lehmann,

1404
01:32:27,707 --> 01:32:30,342
and how he planned and
carried out the grisly murders

1405
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:33,010
in our sleepy town.

1406
01:32:33,012 --> 01:32:35,214
As for Rosedale's
so-called Tragedy Girls,

1407
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:37,749
the brave Sadie Cunningham
and McKayla Hooper

1408
01:32:37,751 --> 01:32:40,686
have managed to turn
tragedy into triumph.

1409
01:32:40,688 --> 01:32:43,321
With an upcoming book tour,
major interviews,

1410
01:32:43,323 --> 01:32:45,190
and a Lifetime movie
in the works,

1411
01:32:45,192 --> 01:32:46,491
I sat down with the girls

1412
01:32:46,493 --> 01:32:48,626
to discuss their plans
for the future.

1413
01:32:48,628 --> 01:32:51,295
Uh, we'd just like to be
normal, down-to-earth students.

1414
01:32:51,297 --> 01:32:53,732
I mean, living a life
of anonymity, really.

1415
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:55,601
Getting full scholarships
certainly helps,

1416
01:32:55,603 --> 01:32:58,736
but for now, I'd like to focus
on my program as a film major.

1417
01:32:58,738 --> 01:33:01,572
McKayla, what do you feel
is your greatest triumph?

1418
01:33:01,574 --> 01:33:03,608
Finding a best friend
like Sadie.

1419
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:06,044
That's awesome, tight?

1420
01:33:06,046 --> 01:33:07,678
Hashtag blessed.

1421
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:10,581
Ugh!
Dude, I hate that top!

1422
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:13,085
- Shut up, you look great.
- You guys all set?

1423
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:14,486
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1424
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:16,455
Look, be careful.
Call if you need anything.

1425
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:19,394
- Dad...
- Look out for each other.

1426
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:22,561
There are 10 dinners
in the freezer.

1427
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:24,530
Thanks, kiddo.

1428
01:33:24,532 --> 01:33:26,531
- Dad, stop crying!
- Love you.

1429
01:33:26,533 --> 01:33:29,668
- Love you.
- Let's do it!

1430
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:34,138
- Be careful, no texting!
- No promises!

1431
01:33:36,109 --> 01:33:38,710
- We did good.
- Yeah.

1432
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:42,880

to Jordan's charity below.

1434

It's for, like,
a really good cause.

1435
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:49,554
We may have survived
Rosedale...

1436
01:33:49,556 --> 01:33:52,257
But we're ready to start
a whole new chapter.

1437
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:54,358
- Stay tuned.
- And keep following...

1438
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,128
The Tragedy Girls.
Whoo!

1439

♪ So fuck tomorrow,
