1
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:26,414
One contest...
- Jon, one song...

2
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:28,173
Trust me.
- Hit the fucking brakes.

3
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,580
This place looks sweet.
- I'll get the boards.

4
00:00:30,752 --> 00:00:32,481
That's my boy.
- Yeah, fuck you.

5
00:00:32,654 --> 00:00:35,248
Hey. Who is this guy?
- Some freak from Santa Clara.

6
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:37,358
- Don't worry about him.
- Who gives a fuck?

7
00:00:37,526 --> 00:00:39,926
No, I'm not worried about it,
I'm just saying.

8
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:43,030
Listen, man, this is fucking America,
man, not fucking Zimbabwe.

9
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:45,029
Zimbabwe? Yo, fucking Caribbean, bitch.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,600
How many times I gotta remind you?
Kiss my ass.

11
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:49,532
Yo, leave this motherfucker here, man.

12
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:52,333
I'll drive Miss Daisy,
I'll drive your ass home, bitch.

13
00:00:52,507 --> 00:00:54,304
Drive this surfboard right up your...

14
00:00:54,476 --> 00:00:56,410
Let's go.
- We're breaking in!

15
00:00:56,578 --> 00:00:58,307
Hey. Keep it down.
- Shut up!

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,038
- Shut up!
- Why, are you scared?

17
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:01,409
Yeah. Yeah, I'm scared.

18
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,814
- Don't drop my board or I'll cut your throat.
- Take this, Aryan bitch.

19
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:09,150
I don't know where you found this
swastika-waving wannabe skinhead.

20
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:11,292
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Fucking psycho.

21
00:01:55,203 --> 00:01:57,467
Wait till you see the reaction on his face.

22
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,072
Yo, it's corn-fed, fucking...

23
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:02,142
What the fuck are you doing
on my beach?

24
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,801
What you say, fussy?
You're too red-eyed.

25
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,076
You don't run this thing.
You run your pussy-whore blood-clot.

26
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:13,415
He says that you don't own the ocean.

27
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:15,516
Is that a fact?

28
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,453
Let me tell you something.

29
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:20,789
I own every drop of water
between here and the lighthouse...

30
00:02:20,962 --> 00:02:23,226
...as well as the sand
and everything on it.

31
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:27,528
Which I guess now includes you.

32
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:34,174
Hey, you know what? Fuck that.

33
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:36,572
Why don't you just blow me,
you old fuck?

34
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:41,147
Hey. Take it easy, man.
We're done here, anyway.

35
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:45,446
Uh-uh. We're just getting started.

36
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,713
- Jesus.
- We jumped your gate, it's not like...

37
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:49,584
...we went for a swim in your pool.

38
00:02:49,758 --> 00:02:53,216
- We'd never go into anyone's house.
- Unless we were invited.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

40
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:15,607
Hey.

41
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:17,617
Make sure you take the head.

42
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:29,889
Yo. Suck my dick, bitch.

43
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:32,363
Hey, Shane. Check this out.

44
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:35,866
Ow. Fucking...

45
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:39,439
I think I hit the spine.

46
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:43,402
Oh, you son of a bitch.

47
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:45,307
You fucking...

48
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,209
Clear the shot.

49
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:50,447
There you go.
You ain't talking shit now, you bitch.

50
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:06,811
Not bad, right?

51
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,426
Not bad, not bad.

52
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:16,320
Not bad at all.

53
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:19,292
Right, little sister?

54
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:25,465
Thank you.

55
00:06:25,807 --> 00:06:28,970
- Told you this was gonna work out.
- Yeah? Then where's the sun?

56
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:31,044
The sun's overrated.

57
00:06:31,212 --> 00:06:32,839
Gives you wrinkles.

58
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:34,174
- Chris.
- Come on.

59
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:35,475
Get out.

60
00:06:36,718 --> 00:06:39,084
Be nice.
- I'm always nice.

61
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:41,188
You're the one with the temper.

62
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:43,415
Now, see? That wasn't nice.

63
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:46,588
You're such an ass.
- Yup.

64
00:06:47,962 --> 00:06:49,054
<i>Coming.</i>

65
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:53,328
- Oh, my goodness, look at you.
- Hi. Hey, Aunt Jillian.

66
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:55,765
I wasn't expecting you for ages,
you're so early.

67
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,700
We didn't know how long it would take.

68
00:06:57,872 --> 00:06:59,863
The last time I saw you,
you were this high.

69
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,702
- I drank my milk.
- Come here.

70
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:04,071
You drank your milk, you silly...

71
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:08,277
And Nicole, come here. Come here.

72
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,815
Let me look at you.

73
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:12,282
You're so beautiful. You...

74
00:07:12,454 --> 00:07:14,615
You look so much like your mom.

75
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:18,054
- It's totally blowing my mind.
- Thanks.

76
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:21,795
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:25,056
I'm so sorry that I didn't...

78
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,133
- That's okay, Aunt Jillian.
- Didn't know...

79
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:28,428
Aunt Jillian.

80
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:30,503
- Thank you.
- Look at me.

81
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:33,897
Let's get you guys situated.

82
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:37,135
So this is what we call in the business
"a diamond in the rough."

83
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:42,579
It's got great bones,
but it could use a little sprucing up.

84
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:44,550
There we go.

85
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:47,586
So there's the kitchen over there
and some storage over there.

86
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:50,781
Sleeping space here, living...
Come this way.

87
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,153
Half-bath through there...

88
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:56,058
...and it creates a very nice
rustic-y charm, feng-shui-type flow...

89
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:58,324
...that leads us straight out to... Come on.

90
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,730
- this out to here.

91
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:02,961
There we go. Ta-da!

92
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:04,537
Beautiful.

93
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:06,503
Just watch that step there.

94
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:08,767
So lots of fresh air...

95
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:10,774
Scat. Scat.

96
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:12,776
Just ignore the old guy.

97
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:15,780
I was thinking 650 a month,
how does that sound?

98
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,974
<i>Six- fifty?</i>

99
00:08:17,152 --> 00:08:20,781
I know, I know. I could be getting
at least 800, but what am I gonna do?

100
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:22,946
Charge you guys full price?
You're family.

101
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:26,160
Well, it sounds good.

102
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:29,854
It is so great having you both here.

103
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:35,661
Here's the keys.
Remember, Jillian with a J.

104
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:45,513
I thought she was gonna let us
stay here for free.

105
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,308
Well, yeah. So did I.

106
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:52,411
Does this even work?
- Yeah. I'm sure it's fine.

107
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:55,784
- Plug it in, dust it off.
- It doesn't work.

108
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,752
Hey, Nicole. Check this out.

109
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:02,357
Oh, my God.

110
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:06,794
We're gonna put this up right now.
These have got to go up.

111
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:08,993
It's a safety hazard.

112
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,367
Right there on that nail, right there.
- Oh, oh, wait. There?

113
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:16,533
Now this place has everything.

114
00:09:18,446 --> 00:09:20,277
Chris, where are we gonna sleep?

115
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:23,781
No, no, no. There's a bedroom back here,
and we have that futon.

116
00:09:23,952 --> 00:09:26,853
Maybe we can pick up
another futon, used, for right over there.

117
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:30,320
- A futon? A used futon?
- Yeah.

118
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:31,890
Great. Yeah.

119
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,995
You know, I bet this is
just like college, only not cool.

120
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:37,458
You know what?

121
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:40,123
Maybe we'll get out of here
for a little bit, okay?

122
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:42,098
We can unpack later. Let's go.

123
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,294
Okay.

124
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:55,879
It's right here.

125
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,206
Hey, you wouldn't
happen to have the time?

126
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:24,343
Um... Uh...

127
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:26,914
You're actually wearing a watch, so...

128
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:28,480
Yeah.

129
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:30,746
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's broken,
you know.

130
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,510
Oh. Uh-huh.

131
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:34,518
You're Chris Emerson, right?

132
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:36,486
Yeah, yeah. What's your name, man?

133
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:37,682
<i>- Alex.
- Hey.</i>

134
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:40,293
Dude, it's too bad
you got kicked off the circuit.

135
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:43,862
You were the most amazing surfer
since Slater, since Powers, man.

136
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:47,195
- You totally screwed that guy up.
- Thanks, dude, I appreciate that.

137
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:49,268
So, what are you doing here alone?

138
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:51,502
That sounded kind of creepy, didn't it?

139
00:10:51,673 --> 00:10:53,402
Yeah, a little.

140
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:55,101
I'm here with my brother.

141
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:58,109
Reason I asked is because
it's not that safe around here...

142
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:00,247
...for girls to be alone, you know?

143
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,151
- Creepy, once again. Sorry.
- Yeah. Yeah, a little bit.

144
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,187
Just, for whatever reason,
this town manages to attract...

145
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:12,087
...a lot of freaks and weirdoes.

146
00:11:12,627 --> 00:11:14,720
Not that I'm a freak or a weirdo.

147
00:11:17,332 --> 00:11:18,924
I'm just gonna stop talking, okay?

148
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:21,095
Okay.

149
00:11:21,736 --> 00:11:24,603
Wanna check something real?
Check out the Frog Brothers' shop.

150
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:26,763
I'm looking for some work.

151
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:29,000
I got the place pretty much handled.

152
00:11:29,177 --> 00:11:30,337
Yeah, I know. I can tell.

153
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:33,344
You seem really busy,
but I was looking to shape.

154
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:36,039
Well, in that case, yeah,
check out Frog Brothers, man.

155
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:38,310
He's the only real shaper
we have around here.

156
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:39,510
Where's his shop at?

157
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:43,123
Man, it's in the ass-end of nowhere,
but I'll draw you a map.

158
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:46,823
- I'm gonna give you my number.
- Because that's not creepy.

159
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:48,427
- Is it?
- I'm totally kidding.

160
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:49,654
Okay, sorry.

161
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:52,794
I don't really even know your name.

162
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:55,629
- Evan.
- I'm Nicole.

163
00:11:55,803 --> 00:11:59,398
Just call me if you want somebody
to hang out with. There you go.

164
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:02,707
Cool.

165
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,270
This should be it, right up here.

166
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:11,278
Charming.

167
00:12:29,437 --> 00:12:32,406
Call me crazy, but do you really think
anyone who lives here...

168
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:35,133
...would be able to pay you to shape?

169
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:37,367
It doesn't hurt to try.

170
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:03,529
- Okay, can we go?
- No. Hand me a piece of paper and a pen.

171
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:05,371
Why?

172
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,976
Just in case he doesn't have a phone,
I want him to know where to find me.

173
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:11,008
Oh, yes. Yes, leave our address...

174
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:14,307
<i>...at the creepy
Texas Chainsaw Massacre trailer.</i>

175
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:16,177
It's a good plan.

176
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,170
I still think it's nicer than our place.

177
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,508
And what do you think
the state of the shower is?

178
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:51,846
Not good.

179
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,283
I think I'm gonna give it a shot.

180
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:06,292
Sorry. Did I scare you?

181
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:08,985
No, sorry, you just...

182
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,230
I didn't hear you come up.

183
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:16,769
You want a picture? It might last longer.

184
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:19,930
Sorry, man. Just...

185
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:21,734
You look exactly like Shane Powers.

186
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:24,002
That makes sense.

187
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:27,242
What the hell happened to you, man?
You had everything.

188
00:15:27,415 --> 00:15:30,475
You were the greatest surfer in the world
and you just disappeared?

189
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:32,710
I could probably ask you
the same question.

190
00:15:33,754 --> 00:15:35,153
Right?

191
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:38,349
Yeah, well. I don't know.

192
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:42,257
The dust hasn't settled yet
so I don't know what the hell happened.

193
00:15:42,697 --> 00:15:45,860
Well, don't take too long to figure it out.

194
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:48,831
But I had a chance to change my life
and I took it, you know.

195
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,828
Carpe diem.

196
00:16:00,748 --> 00:16:03,148
You got plans for tonight?

197
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:04,841
No.

198
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:06,312
I'm having a surf party.

199
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:09,979
You should cruise over,
meet the rest of the guys.

200
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:12,022
They're killer.

201
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,729
Can I come?

202
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:20,128
No, I don't think it's a good idea.

203
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:21,962
Why not?

204
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:24,967
I don't know.
A gut feeling I have, I don't know.

205
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:26,197
I just met this guy.

206
00:16:26,374 --> 00:16:29,309
Oh, please, you had a poster of him
on your wall in high school.

207
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,847
So I wanna go hang out
at his house? He's...

208
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:36,142
He's kind of a weirdo.

209
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:38,979
- Weird is good.
- No, weird is weird, all right?

210
00:16:39,153 --> 00:16:42,714
- I'm not going, so just save your breath.
- What do you mean you're not going?

211
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,120
Chris, what are...? No. Get up, okay?

212
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,590
- Get up. You need a night out.
- No, I don't.

213
00:16:47,762 --> 00:16:49,389
Okay, I need a night out.

214
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:50,723
Let's go. Get up and...

215
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,560
- Hey.
- Hi.

216
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:58,136
I don't know if the two of you
are busy tonight or not, but...

217
00:16:58,472 --> 00:17:00,269
<i>...I have got The Goonies.</i>

218
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:02,900
Excuse me?

219
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:05,744
<i>The Goonies?</i>

220
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:10,247
<i>Oh, my gosh, you mean to say the two
of you have never heard of The Goonies?</i>

221
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:14,884
You are in for a very serious treat.

222
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:17,149
Oh. Uh... Actually, I mean, that...

223
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:21,454
Yeah, that sounds fun,
but we actually have plans.

224
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:25,522
We're going to a party.

225
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:16,549
It's not gonna be that bad.

226
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:18,480
Talk to me after I have a drink.

227
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:21,553
I don't... Don't. Listen,
you're missing out on the whole thing.

228
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:26,056
And I mean, you know, it's...
And it's Chris-fucking-Emerson and his...

229
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:28,422
...hot piece-of-ass sister, Nicole?
- Let's go.

230
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:30,689
What are you guys doing here?
- Shane invited us.

231
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:31,991
No, idiot, here in Luna Bay.

232
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,657
- Are you fucking stalking me?
- We live here.

233
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:36,735
Maybe we can get together again, Nicole.

234
00:18:36,904 --> 00:18:40,203
- You bar-bitching? That your new job?
- Not you, maybe your hot sister, though.

235
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:42,342
Speaking of which,
it's been a long time.

236
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,810
- You're looking really good in those boots.
- Why don't you stop being such an ass?

237
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:48,471
Ooh! Yeah, that's right, walk away.

238
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:51,948
Nicole, you're looking good,
you've really grown into yourself.

239
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,143
- Fuck off.
- Call me.

240
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,787
I told you this was a bad idea.

241
00:18:54,955 --> 00:18:59,187
- Forget about him. He's trying to get to you.
- I don't care, I'm not staying at this party.

242
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,352
Chris. No, that's stupid,
we just got here.

243
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,798
I don't wanna go anywhere, Chris,
I wanna stay and have a good time, okay?

244
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:07,991
I'm not a kid anymore.

245
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:11,332
I know you're not, but you're still
my responsibility, so let's go.

246
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:14,269
Okay, I won't get in trouble, okay?
I promise.

247
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:18,070
I'll take care of myself
and you take care of yourself, okay?

248
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:21,043
Hey, man, what's up? Yes, dude.

249
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,740
Dude, right? That's tight, bro.

250
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:25,351
Okay, okay. Don't look now...

251
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:30,013
...but that little hottie over there by the fire
is giving you all kinds of love.

252
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:33,519
Have fun.

253
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:47,297
Hey, Nicole.

254
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:49,669
Nicole. Nicole.

255
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:03,383
Nicole. Nicole.

256
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:07,288
- Whoo! Woo-hoo.
- Hey, what's your deal?

257
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:10,526
The deal is you're gonna
go over there and sit by yourself...

258
00:20:10,698 --> 00:20:13,633
...and you're gonna drink
these margaritas by yourself.

259
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:16,736
- No, I'm not.
- Jon.

260
00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:20,406
Better than the alternative, bro.

261
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:34,617
It's a hell of a view, isn't it?

262
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:37,885
Yeah. The whole place, it's incredible.

263
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:46,697
Yeah. When I saw that view,
I just knew I had to have this place.

264
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:49,126
I'm Shane.

265
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:50,827
I'm Nicole.

266
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:53,740
Well, Nicole,
how about I give you a little tour?

267
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:56,667
Yeah, okay.

268
00:21:11,926 --> 00:21:15,589
So are you gonna make your move or are
you just gonna watch me dance all night?

269
00:21:17,031 --> 00:21:18,794
I was waiting for my moment.

270
00:21:18,966 --> 00:21:22,527
Seems to me like your moment
almost passed you by, cowboy.

271
00:21:22,703 --> 00:21:24,967
I don't know,
you're standing here talking to me.

272
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:28,131
Only because
I have a weakness for surfer boys.

273
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:30,709
And because I know who you are.

274
00:21:30,978 --> 00:21:32,673
You follow surfing?

275
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:34,245
Surfers.

276
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:36,610
I follow surfers.

277
00:21:40,621 --> 00:21:42,555
And sometimes they follow me.

278
00:21:57,304 --> 00:21:59,738
This is un-fucking-believable.

279
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:15,686
Wow.

280
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,282
- This place is amazing.
- Thank you.

281
00:22:21,595 --> 00:22:25,395
So do you and your brother get along?

282
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:28,733
Yeah. Well, most of the time, you know.

283
00:22:28,902 --> 00:22:32,030
- Kind of have to.
- You have to? Why's that?

284
00:22:32,206 --> 00:22:36,165
Well, because it's pretty much
just us now.

285
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:40,313
Our parents died in a car accident
a few years ago.

286
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:44,781
I think it was actually a lot harder
on Chris than it was on me.

287
00:22:44,952 --> 00:22:47,420
You know,
I think that's why he snapped.

288
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:49,556
Is that why he got kicked off the circuit?

289
00:22:49,723 --> 00:22:50,985
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

290
00:22:51,158 --> 00:22:53,956
And lost all his sponsors.
Not the right image.

291
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:59,828
So we started running out of money
and that's how we ended up here.

292
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,661
Yeah. Yeah.

293
00:23:01,835 --> 00:23:03,564
Well, your brother's a good guy, huh?

294
00:23:03,737 --> 00:23:07,605
He just got a tough break. You both did.

295
00:23:07,775 --> 00:23:09,367
Well...

296
00:23:09,843 --> 00:23:13,404
...I actually think
death can be a positive thing.

297
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,808
You know, because...

298
00:23:14,982 --> 00:23:19,146
...knowing you're gonna die
makes you appreciate life.

299
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,616
The whole carpe diem thing.

300
00:23:21,755 --> 00:23:24,053
That's an interesting view
for someone so young.

301
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:27,490
I'm not that young.

302
00:23:28,028 --> 00:23:29,393
Well...

303
00:23:30,364 --> 00:23:32,389
Dying is a part of living, you know?

304
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:35,967
It's something that's gonna happen
to all of us someday, right?

305
00:23:37,204 --> 00:23:39,138
That depends.

306
00:23:42,276 --> 00:23:43,834
I wanna try something.

307
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,355
I want you to take this dead rose
in your hand.

308
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:09,996
I believe that it's possible
for us to change reality...

309
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,762
...through sheer force of will.

310
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:14,174
You think that's possible?

311
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:16,400
Um...

312
00:24:17,544 --> 00:24:20,377
- I guess so.
- You guess so or you know so?

313
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:25,076
- I know so.
- You know so.

314
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:27,880
Okay, well, then close your eyes.

315
00:24:28,355 --> 00:24:30,289
Close your eyes.

316
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:32,752
Now focus on this rose...

317
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:37,260
...and try to imagine what it must have
been like when it was alive and vital.

318
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,028
Do you feel anything?

319
00:24:42,603 --> 00:24:45,265
- Definitely.
- Mm-hm.

320
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,069
Open your eyes.

321
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:54,906
Oh, my God.

322
00:24:55,215 --> 00:24:57,706
How did you do that?

323
00:24:59,052 --> 00:25:00,542
Magic.

324
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:02,689
And I didn't do it...

325
00:25:05,192 --> 00:25:08,889
...we did it, together.

326
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:10,560
What is it?

327
00:25:11,465 --> 00:25:13,296
It's good, try it.

328
00:25:16,837 --> 00:25:19,169
- Smells good.
- Mm-hm.

329
00:25:23,343 --> 00:25:25,072
What do you think?

330
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:29,441
I like it.

331
00:25:36,857 --> 00:25:39,223
- You okay?
- Yeah.

332
00:25:39,393 --> 00:25:41,861
It just went right to my head.

333
00:25:43,864 --> 00:25:45,923
You wanna go outside
and get some fresh air?

334
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:48,567
Yeah? Let's go.

335
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:03,809
You wanna go for a ride?

336
00:26:05,452 --> 00:26:07,977
I don't know. It's kind of cold out.

337
00:26:08,155 --> 00:26:11,682
Well, that's what this is for.

338
00:26:32,746 --> 00:26:33,974
- Yo, Jon-Jon.
- Hey.

339
00:26:34,147 --> 00:26:35,580
Watch the pretty boy there.

340
00:26:35,749 --> 00:26:38,115
So here we are. Let's show him
a little something.

341
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:39,513
Yeah.
- Come, now.

342
00:26:41,588 --> 00:26:43,647
- Why don't you come upstairs with me...
- Yo, Kyle.

343
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,025
What the fuck?

344
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:53,332
What is it? What?

345
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:56,632
Fuck. It fucking stings, man,
that's not cool.

346
00:26:57,971 --> 00:27:00,963
Fucking asshole, man.
I'm trying to get fucking laid.

347
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:04,133
This is a fucking brand-new shirt, prick.
Come here, come here.

348
00:27:04,311 --> 00:27:06,438
Come here. Give me the fucking knife.

349
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:09,278
What the fuck?

350
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,148
- Come back here.
- Oh, down he goes.

351
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:14,016
I'm sorry.

352
00:27:14,187 --> 00:27:15,779
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

353
00:27:15,956 --> 00:27:17,890
I have to go check on my sister.

354
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:20,583
Your sister?
- Sorry.

355
00:27:20,761 --> 00:27:23,491
So you go that way, huh? I can do that.

356
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:25,427
- Sorry, I gotta go.
- Wait. Don't leave.

357
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,964
- I gotta go.
- Don't leave.

358
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:29,159
- Come on.
- Don't. Stay.

359
00:27:29,336 --> 00:27:31,804
- Sorry.
- Come.

360
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,631
Feel better?

361
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:42,672
- Much.
- Yeah?

362
00:29:09,236 --> 00:29:12,103
I'm sure she's fine, she's with Shane.

363
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:13,603
You know, Shane's a good guy.

364
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:16,800
If I were you,
I'd be happy that he's into your sister.

365
00:29:22,215 --> 00:29:24,513
Hey, get off the bike.

366
00:29:25,152 --> 00:29:26,676
- What? Chris.
- What's up, buddy?

367
00:29:26,853 --> 00:29:28,616
- Get off the bike.
- Is there a problem?

368
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:31,587
No, dude, this is between
me and my sister, man. Thank you.

369
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:35,023
She can handle herself, man. Believe me.

370
00:29:35,195 --> 00:29:36,492
Chris.
- Oh, hell, no.

371
00:29:37,097 --> 00:29:38,530
Chris.
- Jon.

372
00:29:38,698 --> 00:29:40,188
Take it easy.
- Let him go.

373
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:41,800
- Calm down.
- Get off of me.

374
00:29:41,968 --> 00:29:44,436
- Overprotective much?
- She's my family, asshole.

375
00:29:44,604 --> 00:29:47,334
Cool it, bitch. Settle down.

376
00:29:47,841 --> 00:29:49,069
- Let him go.
- What?

377
00:29:49,242 --> 00:29:50,675
Let him go.

378
00:29:58,285 --> 00:30:00,719
Stay the hell away from my sister.

379
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:04,280
Don't.

380
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,517
Stay the hell out of Malibu, Lebowski.

381
00:30:06,693 --> 00:30:09,059
Stop walking like a fag.

382
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,314
I knew we shouldn't have
gone to that party.

383
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,325
I asked you, like, to do two things,
and you completely ignore me.

384
00:30:41,495 --> 00:30:43,690
Do not hang out with some dude
you don't know...

385
00:30:43,864 --> 00:30:46,332
...and don't go up to his room
to party with the guy.

386
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,229
- Okay, Chris. I get it.
- What is that?

387
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:50,164
Stop it.

388
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:54,572
- Should have told me where you were...
- That's enough, stop it.

389
00:30:54,741 --> 00:30:57,175
Stop trying to be my dad.

390
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:02,539
Oh, my God.

391
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:04,980
Oh, my God.

392
00:31:05,485 --> 00:31:08,454
Chris, something is
seriously wrong with me right now.

393
00:31:09,022 --> 00:31:11,547
Nothing's wrong with you,
you're just drunk.

394
00:31:11,725 --> 00:31:13,056
Chris, I am not drunk.

395
00:31:13,226 --> 00:31:15,558
Something is seriously
the matter with me.

396
00:31:15,729 --> 00:31:19,028
Okay, just hang on a little bit, all right?
We're almost home.

397
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:21,963
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I'm gonna...

398
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:30,237
My stomach.

399
00:31:30,844 --> 00:31:32,539
Look, all right, we're almost there.

400
00:31:32,712 --> 00:31:35,340
I'm telling you,
there is something seriously the matter.

401
00:31:35,515 --> 00:31:39,178
You're fine. You just need
a glass of water and some Advil.

402
00:31:39,352 --> 00:31:41,377
All right, you're just drunk.

403
00:31:43,256 --> 00:31:44,951
NICOLE
I am not drunk.

404
00:31:45,892 --> 00:31:47,723
- Nicole. Nicole.
- I'm sick.

405
00:31:58,071 --> 00:32:00,562
Chris Emerson? I'm Edgar Frog.

406
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,573
Surfboard shaper and vampire hunter.

407
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,534
What?

408
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Hey, get...
- What are you doing?
You don't know what you're doing. I'm
trying to save you, your sister's infected.

409
00:32:16,756 --> 00:32:19,247
- What are you talking about?
- She's one of the undead.

410
00:32:19,693 --> 00:32:20,785
Get...

411
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:22,690
Get out of my house.

412
00:32:22,862 --> 00:32:24,261
It's your funeral, pal.

413
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,190
I told you to get the hell out of here, man.

414
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:00,697
Hi.

415
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:04,193
Hi.

416
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:07,204
We didn't get to finish what we started.

417
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:08,974
Yeah.

418
00:33:11,611 --> 00:33:13,943
Well, aren't you gonna invite me in?

419
00:33:15,915 --> 00:33:19,146
Now's not the best time.

420
00:33:25,592 --> 00:33:27,059
Yeah.

421
00:33:27,394 --> 00:33:29,828
Okay. Come on in.

422
00:33:38,705 --> 00:33:41,333
You know what? I'm sorry, I'm not...

423
00:33:41,508 --> 00:33:46,002
- I can't do this with my sister back there.
- Let me see if I can change your mind.

424
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:47,703
Yeah?

425
00:34:07,801 --> 00:34:09,826
You taste good.

426
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:15,969
Oh, hey.

427
00:34:16,376 --> 00:34:19,004
Lisa, get off. Stop.

428
00:34:21,548 --> 00:34:22,810
Lisa, stop it.

429
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:26,613
Seriously, get...
What's the matter with you?

430
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,851
Stop. Seriously, stop.

431
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,814
Get off me.

432
00:34:31,991 --> 00:34:33,117
Lisa, get off.

433
00:34:34,394 --> 00:34:35,588
Lisa, get off.

434
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:57,510
Lisa?

435
00:34:58,151 --> 00:35:00,949
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

436
00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:21,432
What the fuck?

437
00:35:33,686 --> 00:35:36,211
Hey, man.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. Whoa.

438
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:37,413
Whoa.

439
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,718
Let's get something straight.
I let you get away with that shit...

440
00:35:40,894 --> 00:35:44,694
...because I understand what it's like
to lose a family member to the other side.

441
00:35:44,864 --> 00:35:49,164
If it happens again, you're gonna end up on
the wrong side of the stake, are we clear?

442
00:35:50,036 --> 00:35:52,266
- Mm-hm.
- Good.

443
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,138
It's cool, man. Look, I just...

444
00:35:56,309 --> 00:35:59,437
I don't understand
what's going on, all right?

445
00:35:59,612 --> 00:36:01,079
You said my sister was infected?

446
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:03,374
Your sister's become
a member of the undead.

447
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,575
A night stalker. A bloodsucker.

448
00:36:05,752 --> 00:36:07,185
Nosferatu.

449
00:36:08,488 --> 00:36:10,922
Your sister's a suck monkey.

450
00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:13,988
Dude, that's... That's ridiculous, man.

451
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,652
Ridiculous?
Then what are you doing here?

452
00:36:18,064 --> 00:36:21,625
Look, some crazy shit happened
at my place after you left.

453
00:36:21,801 --> 00:36:23,428
Define "crazy shit."

454
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,703
Well, this...
This chick came into my house and...

455
00:36:27,874 --> 00:36:32,709
And she sprouted fangs and then she
turned into stone and exploded.

456
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,512
Now, that's just ridiculous.

457
00:36:36,683 --> 00:36:39,447
Vampires don't just turn into stone
and then explode.

458
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:43,055
They have to be pierced through the heart
with a sharp object.

459
00:36:44,424 --> 00:36:47,188
You know, I guess
the antlers could have done that.

460
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,794
I thought it had to be
a wooden stake or something.

461
00:36:49,963 --> 00:36:52,523
That's a myth. Any sharp object will do.

462
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:55,065
As a matter of fact,
it doesn't have to be sharp.

463
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:57,931
It can be a blunt object,
as long as it pierces the heart.

464
00:36:58,104 --> 00:37:00,629
You said my sister was one of them?

465
00:37:01,207 --> 00:37:03,505
- But how would that happen?
- One of two ways:

466
00:37:03,676 --> 00:37:05,234
Either A, she was bit...

467
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:09,404
...or B, she drank the blood
of the head vampire.

468
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:12,812
How do you know so much
about vampires?

469
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:15,721
Comic books, my friend, comic books.

470
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:18,153
I ask you for answers
and you give me comic books?

471
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:21,919
A lot of valuable information
can be gained by reading comic books.

472
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:23,824
For example...

473
00:37:24,264 --> 00:37:25,595
...see here?

474
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:28,325
This poor sap's drinking the blood
of the head vampire.

475
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:32,062
They like to trick people
by putting it into wine bottles.

476
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:05,294
Dude, what are you drinking, man?

477
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:06,964
Frog Juice.

478
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,200
Garlic, holy water and raw eggs.

479
00:38:12,111 --> 00:38:14,671
Okay, so what you're saying is,
based on a comic book...

480
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:17,372
...my sister drank blood
and now she's a vampire.

481
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,110
Half. She's only half vampire.

482
00:38:20,286 --> 00:38:24,313
She won't make the transition to full
bloodsucker until she makes her first kill.

483
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,687
- Great.
- That is great, actually.

484
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,296
Because it means you still have time
to save her mortal soul.

485
00:38:31,464 --> 00:38:37,164
All you have to do
is kill the head vampire before she feeds.

486
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

487
00:40:03,489 --> 00:40:04,888
Hello?

488
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:08,116
Hello?

489
00:40:08,828 --> 00:40:10,887
It's open.

490
00:40:15,468 --> 00:40:16,992
Hi.

491
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,570
I brought wine.

492
00:40:31,818 --> 00:40:33,843
I love wine.

493
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:56,172
To be honest, I really didn't think
you dug me all that much.

494
00:40:56,342 --> 00:40:58,936
- Why would you think that?
- Just a vibe I got, I guess.

495
00:41:03,449 --> 00:41:05,679
What vibe are you getting now?

496
00:41:05,852 --> 00:41:08,320
A really good one.

497
00:41:24,437 --> 00:41:26,803
Nicole.
- Oh, shit.

498
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:28,871
Did...? Did you do it?

499
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:31,635
- Get the hell out of here.
- We didn't do anything, man.

500
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:35,076
Dude, I didn't know you guys
were born-again Christians or whatever.

501
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:39,884
Man, I'm not using your sister.

502
00:41:40,052 --> 00:41:42,452
Yeah, good to know. Thank you.
- I really like her.

503
00:42:26,766 --> 00:42:31,100
This is basically one of those, like,
good news/bad news scenario things.

504
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,828
What do you want first?

505
00:42:33,005 --> 00:42:35,906
Oh, shit. Okay, the bad news.

506
00:42:36,075 --> 00:42:39,636
Okay, the bad news is that the wine
that Shane gave you the other night...

507
00:42:39,812 --> 00:42:42,144
...wasn't wine, all right, it was blood.

508
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:44,649
Shane's blood.

509
00:42:45,551 --> 00:42:46,779
Right.

510
00:42:46,953 --> 00:42:50,787
Okay, Chris, I know you don't like the guy,
but, like, that's disgusting.

511
00:42:50,957 --> 00:42:54,324
No, and by drinking his blood,
you've been turned into a vampire.

512
00:42:54,493 --> 00:42:56,825
Right, I'm a vampire, Chris. Great.

513
00:42:56,996 --> 00:42:59,590
Stop being such an asshole,
I'm not a freaking vampire.

514
00:42:59,765 --> 00:43:02,063
I'm not being an asshole, Nicole.

515
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:06,870
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but take a look.

516
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:08,233
See anything missing?

517
00:43:08,674 --> 00:43:09,902
You.

518
00:43:14,814 --> 00:43:17,874
No. Vampire. You weren't gonna
make out with that kid...

519
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,244
...you were gonna eat him.

520
00:43:19,418 --> 00:43:22,649
You had fangs and crazy eyes,
I saw it all.

521
00:43:28,327 --> 00:43:30,591
Okay, the good news
better be really fucking good.

522
00:43:30,763 --> 00:43:33,459
No, the good news is great news, okay?

523
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:36,397
See, right now you're only, like,
half of a vampire.

524
00:43:36,569 --> 00:43:38,434
Which means
you can be turned back human.

525
00:43:38,604 --> 00:43:41,698
As long as Eddie and I
kill the head vampire before you feed.

526
00:43:41,874 --> 00:43:44,104
- So just don't eat anyone.
- What? Who's Eddie?

527
00:43:44,139 --> 00:43:45,822
Eddie Frog, he's a vampire slayer.

528
00:43:45,994 --> 00:43:48,929
- I thought he was a surfboard shaper.
- Well, that too.

529
00:43:50,131 --> 00:43:52,292
Right. Okay.

530
00:43:52,467 --> 00:43:55,527
Let me just get this straight then.
So you've teamed up...

531
00:43:55,703 --> 00:43:58,194
...with a
surfboard-shaper-slash-vampire-hunter...

532
00:43:58,373 --> 00:44:01,240
...so you can kill this guy
who I'm totally crushing on...

533
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:04,435
...so you can save me
from eternal damnation?

534
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:07,445
- Is that pretty much it?
- Yeah, that's pretty much it.

535
00:44:13,021 --> 00:44:15,990
- No. Calm down, calm down.
- No, Chris, I'm not gonna calm down.

536
00:44:16,157 --> 00:44:17,920
- No.
- What's wrong with you?

537
00:44:18,093 --> 00:44:20,152
I tried to eat that guy,
do you realize that?

538
00:44:20,328 --> 00:44:22,956
Do you know what it's like for me
to want to drink blood?

539
00:44:23,131 --> 00:44:26,430
Do you know how disgusting that is?
I'm a vegetarian.

540
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

541
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Is he behind Door Number 1?
Door Number 2?

542
00:45:41,709 --> 00:45:43,540
Or Door Number...

543
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:45,803
...3?

544
00:46:09,637 --> 00:46:11,264
We're screwed.

545
00:46:12,207 --> 00:46:15,870
There's just too many places
where the nest could be.

546
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Look, I already told you,
Shane's the head vampire.
We went to party at his house
a couple nights ago.
It's gotta be the nest.

547
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,784
There's no way
that any self-respecting vampire...

548
00:46:27,956 --> 00:46:29,924
...would ever live in a place like that.

549
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:34,619
I mean, they may use it as a lure
or a place to feed...

550
00:46:35,163 --> 00:46:37,154
...but they'd never sleep there.

551
00:46:37,332 --> 00:46:39,266
Vampires...

552
00:46:39,901 --> 00:46:43,667
...always look for a place
with a history of human suffering.

553
00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:48,097
<i>Deep, dark, dank places.</i>

554
00:46:49,177 --> 00:46:52,738
<i>Places that never see the light of day.</i>

555
00:46:52,914 --> 00:46:55,439
<i>Places with lots of vermin.</i>

556
00:46:55,817 --> 00:47:00,254
<i>Places that smell of rot and earth...</i>

557
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:02,623
<i>... and decay.</i>

558
00:47:13,935 --> 00:47:17,666
Nicole.

559
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:24,241
Nicole.

560
00:47:51,172 --> 00:47:53,163
<i>Nicole.</i>

561
00:47:57,045 --> 00:47:58,774
<i>Hurry.</i>

562
00:48:07,455 --> 00:48:09,150
<i>Hurry.</i>

563
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:18,362
There's no way we can find out
where the nest is...

564
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:21,024
...without you being in their inner circle.

565
00:48:21,202 --> 00:48:23,136
Well, then that's what I'll do.

566
00:48:23,671 --> 00:48:24,933
I'll get back in with them.

567
00:48:25,106 --> 00:48:28,542
- I'm gonna become one of them.
- Don't be stupid, all right?

568
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,974
They can read your thoughts
before you have them.

569
00:48:31,145 --> 00:48:33,909
Come on, man. She's family, asshole.

570
00:48:41,255 --> 00:48:43,553
You hit a soft spot there.

571
00:48:44,092 --> 00:48:46,287
I know what it's like to lose a sibling.

572
00:48:49,097 --> 00:48:53,363
If you're gonna do this,
then you have to do it all the way.

573
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:56,065
I mean, you have to be seduced by it.

574
00:48:56,237 --> 00:48:58,762
You have to succumb to it.

575
00:48:59,841 --> 00:49:04,904
You have to take it all the way
to the brink of becoming a full vampire.

576
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:09,209
And then you have to betray them
at the last possible moment.

577
00:49:09,384 --> 00:49:11,875
Do you think you can really handle that?

578
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,253
It's the only way, Eddie.

579
00:49:15,056 --> 00:49:16,614
Edgar.

580
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:18,759
Sorry, Edgar.

581
00:49:18,926 --> 00:49:20,052
You know I'm right.

582
00:49:27,802 --> 00:49:29,429
It's a dangerous game.

583
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:32,900
And it's one that you're likely to lose.

584
00:49:34,008 --> 00:49:35,839
So just know...

585
00:49:36,978 --> 00:49:38,946
...if you forget your place...

586
00:49:39,547 --> 00:49:41,777
...and you become one of them...

587
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,082
...l'll be coming for you.

588
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:51,845
This shit's cool.

589
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:55,045
Yo, Kyle, stop playing
with yourself, man, the game gonna start.

590
00:50:55,223 --> 00:50:56,918
Fucking cheater.
- You know what?

591
00:50:57,091 --> 00:50:59,855
- I been calling you, brethren.
- You haven't been calling me.

592
00:51:00,027 --> 00:51:01,358
Shut up.

593
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:04,557
Always with your crying.

594
00:51:04,732 --> 00:51:07,701
- Dude, quit it. Fucking cheater.
- Listen, don't start crying.

595
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:09,427
Check it out. Check it out.

596
00:51:09,604 --> 00:51:11,094
Tape them.

597
00:51:11,272 --> 00:51:13,069
- Tape them, man.
- Skin out.

598
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:16,975
So nice.
- Backside.

599
00:51:21,082 --> 00:51:23,550
Yeah, bitch.
- Holy fuck.

600
00:51:23,718 --> 00:51:25,811
- What the fuck is your problem?
- Motherfucker.

601
00:51:25,987 --> 00:51:28,922
You're a dead man.
- Yeah, fucking blow me, buddy. Again.

602
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,149
- Who's the cheater now?
- Fucking white people.

603
00:51:31,325 --> 00:51:32,883
Pull this out. I ain't playing.

604
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,120
- You're gonna be all over the fucking Net.
- Stop. Fuck off.

605
00:51:36,297 --> 00:51:38,197
Dude, you're fucking squirting
everywhere.

606
00:51:38,366 --> 00:51:39,663
- You're a squirter.
- Shane.

607
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:07,024
What about my brother?

608
00:52:07,395 --> 00:52:08,794
I don't wanna lose him.

609
00:52:08,963 --> 00:52:10,555
You won't.

610
00:52:16,504 --> 00:52:18,369
Trust me.

611
00:53:38,653 --> 00:53:39,881
Full name?

612
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:41,783
Uh, Nicole.

613
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:44,581
Em...

614
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:46,417
Emerson.

615
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:50,160
All right, we'll call you.

616
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:52,822
That's it? Just gonna
type her name onto a computer...

617
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,468
...and hope someone turns her in
like a dog pound?

618
00:53:55,636 --> 00:53:58,366
- Isn't that kind of passive?
- Son, we have a system.

619
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:00,734
Officer, there's gotta be
something you can do...

620
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:03,968
- Sheriff.
- Sheriff, I'm sorry.

621
00:54:04,211 --> 00:54:05,542
I'm really worried about her.

622
00:54:05,713 --> 00:54:07,977
McGRAW: We have a lot of missing persons
around here.

623
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:11,312
I know. I mean,
what if they're not missing, you know?

624
00:54:11,485 --> 00:54:12,952
It could be something else.

625
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,213
Son, hit the road. We have a system.

626
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,823
Luna Bay. Sheriff McGraw.

627
00:54:21,262 --> 00:54:22,923
Really? How big?

628
00:54:23,364 --> 00:54:25,992
Yeah, last week
I caught about a 25-pounder.

629
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:39,344
Not very helpful, huh?

630
00:54:40,414 --> 00:54:43,542
Yeah, I was gonna ask them
if they could help us find Lisa.

631
00:54:43,718 --> 00:54:46,380
Haven't seen her in a couple of days.

632
00:54:47,388 --> 00:54:50,846
Hey, didn't I see you with her last?

633
00:54:52,893 --> 00:54:54,588
Where's my sister, man?

634
00:54:54,762 --> 00:54:57,356
Oh, yeah, your sister.

635
00:54:57,531 --> 00:54:59,226
Man, I saw her like an hour ago.

636
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,664
She looked like she was having
a really good time.

637
00:55:01,836 --> 00:55:03,360
Where the hell is my sister, man?

638
00:55:03,537 --> 00:55:07,234
<i>Oh, hey, hey. Relax, little man, okay?</i>

639
00:55:07,408 --> 00:55:11,811
Trust me when I tell you this is, right here,
a time that you wanna keep your cool...

640
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:14,470
...if you ever wanna see Nicole again.

641
00:55:21,756 --> 00:55:23,280
What do you want?

642
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,354
It's not what I want, bro...

643
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:29,258
...it's what Shane wants.

644
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:32,698
Get in the car.

645
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,171
How's it, ladies?

646
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,748
Mr. Vampire Slayer, how you doing?

647
00:56:27,988 --> 00:56:29,649
You okay?

648
00:56:30,024 --> 00:56:31,457
I'm good.

649
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:33,388
I'm really good.

650
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:39,795
Sorry about last night, man.

651
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:43,335
You were protecting your sister.

652
00:56:44,305 --> 00:56:45,932
I get it.

653
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:49,371
But I'd never do anything to hurt her.

654
00:56:49,543 --> 00:56:55,778
In fact, once you understand it a little more,
you'll see I've given Nicole a gift.

655
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:01,755
Do you know how much
the fear of death has limited you, Chris?

656
00:57:01,922 --> 00:57:04,550
The negative impact it's had on your life?

657
00:57:05,593 --> 00:57:07,857
You're probably not even aware of it.

658
00:57:08,028 --> 00:57:12,192
And I'm not just talking about
the fear of your own death, no.

659
00:57:12,933 --> 00:57:16,994
Look at what the fear of losing
your loved ones has done to you.

660
00:57:18,138 --> 00:57:20,538
You've been so worried
about losing Nicole...

661
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:24,906
...that it's made you paranoid
and overprotective.

662
00:57:26,213 --> 00:57:28,875
I can take that fear away.

663
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:32,913
I can make you
part of a real family, Chris.

664
00:57:33,721 --> 00:57:36,155
One that never dies.

665
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:42,088
Kyle's human family
wrote him off a long time ago.

666
00:57:42,496 --> 00:57:45,090
They thought he was suicidal.

667
00:57:45,266 --> 00:57:47,427
But I saw him for what he truly was...

668
00:57:47,968 --> 00:57:50,402
...an adrenaline junkie.

669
00:57:52,439 --> 00:57:55,931
Erik, well, the less we say about his past,
the better.

670
00:57:56,110 --> 00:58:00,376
We wouldn't wanna make you
an accessory after the fact, now would we?

671
00:58:01,649 --> 00:58:04,948
And Jonny boy, well...

672
00:58:05,552 --> 00:58:09,989
...after you shattered his knee,
he was never supposed to surf again.

673
00:58:11,392 --> 00:58:12,484
Look at him now.

674
00:58:13,527 --> 00:58:15,051
Stronger than ever, bro.

675
00:58:16,664 --> 00:58:20,430
But for you to truly understand
what we are, Chris...

676
00:58:20,601 --> 00:58:23,502
...you have to see the world
the way we do.

677
00:58:24,438 --> 00:58:26,599
You and your sister...

678
00:58:26,941 --> 00:58:29,034
...will never grow old...

679
00:58:29,443 --> 00:58:32,879
...you'll never die
and you'll never know fear again.

680
00:58:34,248 --> 00:58:36,512
But you have to take that first step.

681
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:53,030
And what's that?

682
00:58:54,935 --> 00:58:58,803
It's a little something
me and the boys came up with.

683
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:29,163
Warriors.

684
00:59:30,371 --> 00:59:33,363
- What the...?
- Come out to play.

685
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,098
Let's go.

686
00:59:55,996 --> 00:59:57,361
Oh, shit.

687
00:59:57,531 --> 00:59:59,795
Now! Now!

688
01:00:21,655 --> 01:00:23,316
Yo, hold up.

689
01:00:26,193 --> 01:00:28,559
Let him out, Kyle.

690
01:00:46,413 --> 01:00:47,710
How do you like that, bitch?

691
01:00:49,616 --> 01:00:50,878
Go, go.

692
01:01:20,814 --> 01:01:22,247
Jump it, Chris.

693
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:34,391
Fuck you!

694
01:01:34,561 --> 01:01:37,257
- Fuck you.
- Yeah.

695
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:52,242
Fuck you!

696
01:02:05,726 --> 01:02:07,193
How do you like that?

697
01:02:07,361 --> 01:02:09,955
Hey, on top of the world, Ma.

698
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:17,762
Hold on, brother.

699
01:02:17,938 --> 01:02:20,668
It's a private club
and you're not a member.

700
01:02:20,841 --> 01:02:23,036
Not yet, anyway.

701
01:02:25,879 --> 01:02:27,039
Well, what if I say yes?

702
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:30,906
Think long and hard about it, Chris.

703
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:34,485
Once you join the tribe,
there's no turning back.

704
01:02:52,873 --> 01:02:55,034
Your check bounced.

705
01:02:55,742 --> 01:02:59,041
No, it's... I transferred some money
from one account to the other, so...

706
01:02:59,213 --> 01:03:03,206
Save the bull for your buddies. I'm gonna
need a new security deposit immediately.

707
01:03:03,383 --> 01:03:06,819
It's gonna need to be in the form
of a cashier's check or a money order.

708
01:03:06,987 --> 01:03:09,649
Maybe this is my fault.
Maybe I gave the wrong impression.

709
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:12,451
Come on, it's not that big of a deal.
Just wait two days.

710
01:03:12,626 --> 01:03:15,857
Just let me finish. Could you please
take your sunglasses off?

711
01:03:16,029 --> 01:03:18,156
I can't talk to you
unless I can see your eyes.

712
01:03:18,332 --> 01:03:21,460
Look, I didn't want you guys
to feel like I was trying to step in...

713
01:03:21,635 --> 01:03:25,071
...and act like your parents, but that
doesn't mean you can go crazy here.

714
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:29,801
I saw your sister had a guy over
last night. How old is she?

715
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:33,274
- She's almost, like, 18.
- That means she's 17 years old.

716
01:03:33,447 --> 01:03:36,814
And you coming and going
at all hours of the day and night...

717
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:39,578
You know,
I have a reputation to think of, l...

718
01:03:39,753 --> 01:03:41,880
I realize I am not your mother, but...

719
01:03:42,055 --> 01:03:45,821
But you... Doesn't mean you can
behave like this on my property.

720
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:47,858
All right, I'm sorry.

721
01:03:51,064 --> 01:03:52,964
Yeah, me too.

722
01:03:55,035 --> 01:03:58,232
Partying all night, sleeping all day.

723
01:03:58,405 --> 01:04:01,169
You both need to quit acting
like a couple of vampires.

724
01:04:12,352 --> 01:04:14,718
This is ridiculous.

725
01:04:36,209 --> 01:04:38,370
<i>You and your sister...</i>

726
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:40,670
<i>... will never grow old...</i>

727
01:04:41,214 --> 01:04:44,650
<i>... you'll never die
and you'll never know fear again.</i>

728
01:05:41,575 --> 01:05:44,840
You're sharking it, man,
you're sharking it.

729
01:05:45,746 --> 01:05:47,338
Who wants some?

730
01:05:47,514 --> 01:05:49,106
Now you ask?

731
01:05:49,282 --> 01:05:51,910
- Where we headed?
- Devil's Reef.

732
01:05:52,085 --> 01:05:54,849
I hear it's firing right now.

733
01:05:55,088 --> 01:05:59,115
- We're paddling out tonight?
- Yeah, why not?

734
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:02,318
There's no moon,
bet we're not gonna see anything.

735
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:08,029
What, you guys have night vision
or something?

736
01:06:08,201 --> 01:06:10,533
What kind of night vision
you chatting about, boy?

737
01:06:10,704 --> 01:06:14,162
- Can't you turn yourselves into bats?
- Way too many movies, bro.

738
01:06:14,341 --> 01:06:17,538
Yeah, we don't have night vision, Chris.

739
01:06:18,011 --> 01:06:22,141
Bats, they don't actually have
night vision either, they have sonar.

740
01:06:22,315 --> 01:06:23,907
You know what? You're half right.

741
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:26,882
Like I told you before,
we do see things differently.

742
01:06:27,354 --> 01:06:29,185
Kind of like you're about to.

743
01:06:34,027 --> 01:06:36,996
After you have a little taste of this.

744
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:21,207
Bye, boy.

745
01:07:35,055 --> 01:07:38,513
- You haven't seen anything yet, Chris.
- No, you ain't. You're not done yet.

746
01:07:38,692 --> 01:07:42,128
Wait till you see the girls
we got waiting for us at the reef, bro.

747
01:07:46,032 --> 01:07:48,262
It's gonna be crazy, bro.

748
01:07:49,202 --> 01:07:52,035
Crazy.

749
01:08:16,596 --> 01:08:18,826
All right, my turn.

750
01:08:22,068 --> 01:08:24,263
Did you ever hear
of getting your own thing?

751
01:08:24,437 --> 01:08:26,530
Did you ever hear of shutting the hell up?

752
01:08:26,706 --> 01:08:29,197
You mind yourself, boy. Mister, ease off.

753
01:08:29,376 --> 01:08:30,775
All right, enough.

754
01:08:32,345 --> 01:08:34,176
What? What, what?

755
01:08:34,347 --> 01:08:35,507
Camera, please.

756
01:08:36,349 --> 01:08:37,816
All right, girls.

757
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,382
I dare you guys to kiss.

758
01:08:41,555 --> 01:08:43,216
- Double dare?
- Double dare.

759
01:08:46,893 --> 01:08:49,361
Oh, fuck, are you seeing this?
Seriously, watch.

760
01:08:51,598 --> 01:08:52,895
I think so.

761
01:08:56,937 --> 01:08:58,199
Guys?
- Oh, hey.

762
01:08:58,371 --> 01:09:00,532
- We're out of here.
- Where are you going?

763
01:09:00,707 --> 01:09:02,732
Back to our place...

764
01:09:02,909 --> 01:09:04,638
...for a drink.
- I'll come with you.

765
01:09:04,811 --> 01:09:07,473
No, hang back, Chris,
there's plenty for you to do here.

766
01:09:07,647 --> 01:09:11,447
Besides, this is Nicole's time.

767
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,725
Just have a seat, man.

768
01:09:23,263 --> 01:09:25,060
Attaboy.

769
01:09:42,182 --> 01:09:43,513
So check this out.

770
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:48,651
Do you know that salt water and blood
are basically the same thing?

771
01:09:49,055 --> 01:09:50,545
It's true.

772
01:09:50,724 --> 01:09:53,921
There's a French biologist
that did this experiment on a stray dog...

773
01:09:54,094 --> 01:09:55,994
...around the turn of the century.

774
01:09:56,162 --> 01:10:00,155
He drained all the blood out of the dog
and replaced it with diluted seawater...

775
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:04,030
...and everybody thought
that this dog was gonna die.

776
01:10:04,571 --> 01:10:06,300
Except the dog didn't.

777
01:10:06,473 --> 01:10:10,534
What they found is that
all the missing blood had regenerated.

778
01:10:10,877 --> 01:10:13,175
The saltwater became blood.

779
01:10:13,413 --> 01:10:18,646
And after that, the dog was more alive
and vibrant than it ever had been before.

780
01:10:19,919 --> 01:10:24,356
The dog went on to live
a long and very healthy life.

781
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:33,191
To long life, Chris.

782
01:10:46,846 --> 01:10:48,575
Let me try some of that.

783
01:10:49,582 --> 01:10:52,551
I don't really think
you'd find it too much to your liking.

784
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:55,187
You might wanna just stick with the beer.

785
01:10:59,626 --> 01:11:04,222
So what exactly was the point
of your very long and boring story, Jon?

786
01:11:04,397 --> 01:11:06,388
Basically, what he's trying to say is...

787
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:08,363
...we're vampires.

788
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:13,631
- Ooh. Scary.
- No, but seriously...

789
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:16,674
...we're vampires.

790
01:11:23,383 --> 01:11:25,180
Help me!

791
01:11:27,754 --> 01:11:28,778
No, no, no.

792
01:11:30,056 --> 01:11:32,524
No, please.

793
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:38,888
Let me go.

794
01:11:39,065 --> 01:11:40,657
Shut the fuck up.

795
01:11:42,635 --> 01:11:44,535
No, no, no.

796
01:11:47,841 --> 01:11:51,277
I'm thinking I love this girl.
Oh, fuck, I love this girl.

797
01:11:54,114 --> 01:11:56,105
Do it.

798
01:11:58,685 --> 01:12:02,018
Do it!

799
01:12:03,056 --> 01:12:05,217
Run. Go.

800
01:12:05,391 --> 01:12:06,881
Come on.

801
01:12:32,552 --> 01:12:33,985
You're fucked up, bro.

802
01:12:34,154 --> 01:12:37,954
Shane's not around to save your ass
and I've had it with your attitude.

803
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Guess you think I'm kidding you, bud...
...but it ain't so.
Where's Shane now, bi...? Fuck.

804
01:13:24,204 --> 01:13:26,832
You ain't got no fucking stick now,
do you?

805
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,837
Come on, let's finish this.

806
01:13:30,009 --> 01:13:31,704
Hey!

807
01:13:33,346 --> 01:13:34,540
Who ordered the stake?

808
01:13:38,518 --> 01:13:40,247
Are you cool?

809
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,717
Yeah, I'm cool.

810
01:13:41,888 --> 01:13:45,221
I said, are you cool?

811
01:13:45,391 --> 01:13:46,688
Show me your teeth.

812
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:48,555
I said I'm cool.

813
01:13:48,728 --> 01:13:51,561
And I said, show me your teeth.

814
01:13:52,866 --> 01:13:56,461
I am cool.

815
01:13:56,903 --> 01:13:59,895
Yeah, I can see that.

816
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:02,774
We don't have time for this shit, Eddie.

817
01:14:02,942 --> 01:14:06,173
We have to get to the nest
and get my sister before she feeds.

818
01:14:08,715 --> 01:14:11,013
That's what I'm talking about.

819
01:14:13,553 --> 01:14:15,646
I hate fucking vampires.

820
01:14:27,233 --> 01:14:28,495
What are you doing, man?

821
01:14:28,668 --> 01:14:30,636
Turning this into holy water.

822
01:14:30,803 --> 01:14:33,169
- I'm a minister.
- You're a minister?

823
01:14:33,339 --> 01:14:35,136
Yup. I got ordained online.

824
01:14:35,308 --> 01:14:39,176
I'm officially recognized by the International
Association of Online Ministers...

825
01:14:39,345 --> 01:14:43,543
...as the Honorable Reverend Edgar Frog,
the vampire hunter.

826
01:14:43,716 --> 01:14:45,183
Did you study for that?

827
01:14:45,351 --> 01:14:48,218
No. I went to the website,
filled out a couple forms...

828
01:14:48,388 --> 01:14:49,685
...and clicked "Ordain Me."

829
01:14:49,856 --> 01:14:54,225
Now, before going into battle, there's
a few things that you need to be briefed on.

830
01:14:54,394 --> 01:14:57,852
First of all, when a vampire buys it,
it's never a pretty sight.

831
01:14:58,031 --> 01:15:00,056
No two bloodsuckers
go out the same way.

832
01:15:00,233 --> 01:15:03,361
Some yell and scream, some go quietly,
some explode, some implode...

833
01:15:03,536 --> 01:15:05,629
...but all will try to take you with them.

834
01:15:05,805 --> 01:15:08,137
As far as your arsenal of vamp artillery:

835
01:15:08,308 --> 01:15:09,400
We got stakes.

836
01:15:09,575 --> 01:15:12,305
Got some wooden ones,
got some metal ones...

837
01:15:12,745 --> 01:15:14,337
...and some carbon-fibers.

838
01:15:14,514 --> 01:15:16,914
I like the resins,
they're light and easy to handle.

839
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:20,541
That said, there's nothing as good
as the old-fashioned, classic wood job.

840
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,950
Safe, sturdy, reliable.

841
01:15:23,122 --> 01:15:27,491
Next, we have my air-propelled-rocket
grenade launcher for holy-water balloons.

842
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,457
This is my baby, don't touch it.

843
01:15:29,629 --> 01:15:31,597
We also have one of these.

844
01:15:31,764 --> 01:15:34,232
- You know how to use this, right?
- Yeah, totally.

845
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,369
- Okay, good.
- No, dude, I have no idea what that is.

846
01:15:37,537 --> 01:15:38,834
It's a garlic bolo.

847
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,571
Never mind, I'll hold on to this one.

848
01:15:44,544 --> 01:15:47,172
Let's go kill some vampires.

849
01:16:11,571 --> 01:16:13,801
They know we're here.

850
01:16:39,232 --> 01:16:41,166
Are you ready?

851
01:16:43,403 --> 01:16:46,463
I guess so.
- You guess so?

852
01:16:49,842 --> 01:16:51,707
I know so.

853
01:17:00,253 --> 01:17:02,153
Help me.

854
01:17:04,657 --> 01:17:06,318
Help me.

855
01:17:17,937 --> 01:17:19,666
You smell that?

856
01:17:22,141 --> 01:17:25,304
Smells like fungus or death.

857
01:17:27,013 --> 01:17:29,607
It's vampire BO.

858
01:18:04,317 --> 01:18:05,750
What?

859
01:18:07,053 --> 01:18:09,715
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Just follow me.

860
01:18:23,336 --> 01:18:26,362
Nicole, help me.

861
01:18:27,473 --> 01:18:28,770
Evan.

862
01:18:33,246 --> 01:18:34,474
I can't.

863
01:18:34,914 --> 01:18:37,178
You said you were ready.

864
01:18:38,117 --> 01:18:39,778
But I know him.

865
01:18:41,687 --> 01:18:44,747
Well, he's the only thing
that still stands between us, Nicole.

866
01:18:44,924 --> 01:18:47,449
The only thing that stands
between you and immortality.

867
01:18:47,627 --> 01:18:50,221
If you wanna be with me...

868
01:18:50,396 --> 01:18:51,624
...if you love me...

869
01:18:51,797 --> 01:18:53,856
...you'll do this.

870
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:22,124
Quiet, man, you'll wake the dead.

871
01:19:22,295 --> 01:19:23,728
Chris.

872
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:26,054
Chris.

873
01:19:29,302 --> 01:19:30,929
Chris.

874
01:19:31,504 --> 01:19:32,732
Shit.

875
01:19:32,905 --> 01:19:36,033
What part of "stay together"
don't you understand?

876
01:20:45,378 --> 01:20:47,539
I smell ugly.

877
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

878
01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:05,890
Chris.

879
01:21:08,334 --> 01:21:09,961
Come on, Chris.

880
01:21:10,136 --> 01:21:11,535
Chris isn't here, Eddie...

881
01:21:11,971 --> 01:21:13,461
...but your brother is.

882
01:21:13,639 --> 01:21:15,573
Where are you?

883
01:21:22,281 --> 01:21:23,976
Yup, it's ugly.

884
01:21:26,018 --> 01:21:27,383
Missed.

885
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:35,188
Pop goes the weasel.

886
01:22:00,619 --> 01:22:02,280
<i>Chris.</i>

887
01:22:04,156 --> 01:22:06,522
<i>Stay forever.</i>

888
01:22:06,692 --> 01:22:09,217
<i>Live forever.</i>

889
01:22:09,395 --> 01:22:12,262
<i>Stay with family.</i>

890
01:22:12,431 --> 01:22:13,693
<i>Chris.</i>

891
01:22:16,202 --> 01:22:17,533
Chris.

892
01:22:18,637 --> 01:22:20,366
Welcome.

893
01:22:39,425 --> 01:22:40,483
Chris.

894
01:22:43,295 --> 01:22:46,992
I've been waiting to meet someone like you
for quite some time, Chris.

895
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:50,465
Someone that would push the boundaries,
someone that would challenge me.

896
01:22:50,636 --> 01:22:52,831
- I saw that in you.
- Chris.

897
01:22:57,643 --> 01:23:00,043
I don't wanna lose my brother.

898
01:23:00,579 --> 01:23:02,911
Come on, taking in someone's essence...

899
01:23:03,082 --> 01:23:05,141
...consuming living human blood...

900
01:23:05,317 --> 01:23:07,478
...that's the real rush.

901
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

902
01:23:19,298 --> 01:23:20,356
No!

903
01:23:20,533 --> 01:23:21,591
Shane!

904
01:23:25,771 --> 01:23:27,705
No. Shane. Stop.

905
01:23:27,873 --> 01:23:30,808
You're killing him. Shane!

906
01:23:32,678 --> 01:23:34,202
No!

907
01:23:45,424 --> 01:23:46,652
Nicole.

908
01:23:46,826 --> 01:23:48,657
Why?

909
01:23:48,828 --> 01:23:50,557
He's family, asshole.

910
01:23:52,898 --> 01:23:54,695
Shane.

911
01:23:57,636 --> 01:23:58,660
Shane, stop.

912
01:24:16,255 --> 01:24:17,813
<i>Nicole.</i>

913
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:22,054
<i>Nicole.</i>

914
01:24:22,228 --> 01:24:24,560
<i>Nicole.</i>

915
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:27,098
<i>Nicole.</i>

916
01:24:41,313 --> 01:24:43,611
Build a man a fire...

917
01:24:44,216 --> 01:24:46,275
...and he's warm for a day.

918
01:24:47,486 --> 01:24:49,920
Light a man on fire...

919
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:53,891
...and he's warm for the rest of his life.

920
01:25:06,272 --> 01:25:09,400
You'll be getting a bill for my services.

921
01:25:41,507 --> 01:25:44,908
- Thanks, Eddie.
- Hey, it's what I do.

922
01:25:46,612 --> 01:25:48,136
And it's Edgar.

923
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:59,080
Hey, is it...?

924
01:25:59,258 --> 01:26:01,123
Is it cool if I call you sometime?

925
01:26:01,293 --> 01:26:03,284
Uh...

926
01:26:03,829 --> 01:26:05,524
Okay.

927
01:26:06,832 --> 01:26:08,390
Yes!

928
01:26:17,743 --> 01:26:19,438
Woo-hoo!

929
01:26:57,950 --> 01:27:00,748
This is completely unacceptable.

930
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,952
I know exactly what you've been up to.

931
01:27:04,123 --> 01:27:07,581
I am telling you, it has to stop right now.

932
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,856
I will not stand by and watch
two young people that I care about...

933
01:27:12,031 --> 01:27:14,158
...fall into this trap, you hear me?

934
01:27:18,003 --> 01:27:22,337
So if I so much as see one seed...

935
01:27:22,808 --> 01:27:25,641
...or catch one whiff of reefer...

936
01:27:25,811 --> 01:27:28,507
And believe me,
I know what it smells like.

937
01:27:28,681 --> 01:27:30,046
- I'm calling the cops.

938
01:27:30,215 --> 01:27:35,380
No warning. We are talking
zero tolerance, you got that?

939
01:27:36,288 --> 01:27:39,485
End of discussion.

940
01:28:34,513 --> 01:28:36,606
Cut the theatrics.

941
01:28:37,483 --> 01:28:39,644
I know you're out there.

942
01:28:39,818 --> 01:28:41,149
Show yourself.

943
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
That's a good way
to get yourself staked, Sam.
Easy there, compadre.
After all the shit that you pulled?

944
01:28:53,031 --> 01:28:57,968
I think you can at least hear me out.
I mean, I feel like you owe me that.

945
01:28:58,137 --> 01:29:01,163
You really expect me to act like
nothing ever happened?

946
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:03,274
No, I've already forgiven you.

947
01:29:03,442 --> 01:29:05,774
It's water under the bridge.

948
01:29:06,278 --> 01:29:07,905
Stay there.

949
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:12,039
- You don't want it to go down like this.
- Oh, it's going down like this.

950
01:29:12,217 --> 01:29:13,514
I'm warning you.

951
01:29:13,685 --> 01:29:15,007
Hey, I'm trembling.
