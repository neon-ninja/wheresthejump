1
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,852
I can tell you like it.

2
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:01,976
Oh.

3
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,350
I love it.

4
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,479
It's perfect.

5
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,613
Well, great.

6
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,191
It really is such a neat place.

7
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,952
You know, I showed it
to another girl this morning.

8
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,190
But to be honest,
I didn't like her very much.

9
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,664
She looks like trouble,

10
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,760
and I'm way too old to be
dealing with all that nonsense.

11
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,171
I go a lot on my gut feelings,
and I have a good one about you.

12
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,208
You remind me of my daughter.

13
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,141
Oh, thank you.

14
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,180
It's just what
I've been looking for.

15
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,304
Well, great.

16
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:36,286
Welcome to your new home.

17
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,732
I'll get things moving
on your application,

18
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,034
and we'll have you set up here
in no time.

19
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,544
Um, about the deposit, um....

20
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,146
Okay, I'll tell you what.

21
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,647
If it'll help you out,
and I imagine it would,

22
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,809
I'll agree to waive
all of the deposit stuff.

23
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,716
You just give me
the first month's down.

24
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,014
We'll call it a day, all right?

25
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,144
Really?

26
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,587
That would be incredible.

27
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,022
Well, I remember when
my daughter was looking

28
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,525
for her first apartment.

29
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,562
It's hard coming up
with all that money, isn't it?

30
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,721
You just promise me

31
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,231
that you are gonna take
good care of this place.

32
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,391
I promise.

33
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,230
Besides,
you'll be a good tenant.

34
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,769
I always trust my gut.

35
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,169
Well, you won't regret it.
I swear.

36
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,765
Oh, you know,
I have some things

37
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,743
I have to still take care of
with the gal that lives here.

38
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,404
You just get me the check
by Monday.

39
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,879
I'll have you in by the end
of the week,

40
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,347
if that's okay with you.

41
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,440
I can do whatever.

42
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,575
Good.

43
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,778
Thank you so much.

44
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,513
You bet, sweetie.
Bye-bye.

45
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,225
Heather, come on.

46
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,387
It's morning.

47
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,234
Please leave a message
after the beep.

48
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,367
Hi.

49
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,570
This is Samantha Hughes.

50
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,682
I'm calling in regards
to the babysitter flyer

51
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,683
posted outside my dorm.

52
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,377
I hope this is the right number.

53
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:46,049
If it is, you can reach me
at 815-1920.

54
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,659
I'm very interested.

55
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,887
Thank you.

56
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,123
Hello?

57
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,563
Samantha.

58
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,225
Yes?

59
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:34,738
You just left me a message
about the babysitting position.

60
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,604
Oh, yeah, I did.

61
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,643
How did you get this number?

62
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,408
Please excuse the urgency,
but if you're still interested,

63
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,278
I would like to meet you.

64
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,478
Sure.
That would be fine.

65
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,248
Well, I'm afraid
I'm not too familiar

66
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,447
with the layout over there.

67
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,580
Perhaps you could meet me

68
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,159
in front
of the Student Affairs office?

69
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,558
That's where I dropped off
my advertisements.

70
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,131
Okay, I know where that is.

71
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,460
Wonderful.

72
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,262
I'll see you there.

73
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:07,668
Right now?

74
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,672
Hello?

75
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,402
Psst.

76
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,070
All right, everyone.

77
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,103
Have a great holiday.
I'll see you guys next year.

78
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,109
Whoo-hoo.
Whoo.

79
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,877
So tell me all about it.

80
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,650
I want details.

81
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,055
Well, it's not too big.

82
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,491
When you walk in,

83
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,620
there's, like, a little
living room area on the left

84
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:53,959
and then a hallway
down the right.

85
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,363
Oh, it is carpet or hardwood?

86
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,525
Hardwood.

87
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,658
Good.

88
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,168
Carpet's filth,

89
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,705
especially for a germaphobe
like you.

90
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,139
I'm not a germaphobe.

91
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,369
What?

92
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,878
I don't like gross things.

93
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,982
Anyway,
the kitchen's kind of blah,

94
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,175
and so is the bathroom.

95
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,718
But I'll paint them cool colors
or something.

96
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,843
Yeah.

97
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,388
Oh.

98
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,684
I wish you had pictures.

99
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,019
Yeah, me too.

100
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,855
I'm sort of sucking
at explaining it right now.

101
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,190
But you'll see it soon.

102
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,164
Yeah, well, it sounds great.

103
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:34,036
Mm.

104
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,698
This pizza is nasty today.

105
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,400
Gross.

106
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,240
Ugh.

107
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,439
Megan, how am I gonna afford
all this stuff?

108
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,709
I'm-
You're gonna be fine.

109
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,614
It's gonna work out.

110
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,015
That's easy for you to say.

111
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,055
You're not the one
with $84 in her bank account

112
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,589
and a check to write on Monday.

113
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,091
Yeah, but just relax.

114
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,717
It's Wednesday.

115
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,353
You know, if it's a big problem,
I can always call my dad.

116
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,863
No, don't do that.

117
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,733
No, look, he really
doesn't care at all.

118
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,306
Look, I'm not saying
it's gonna get to that point,

119
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,875
but if it does,
you're never gonna be homeless.

120
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,638
Yeah?

121
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:17,909
It's so weird and annoying

122
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,642
the way that guy
stood you up today.

123
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,652
I know.

124
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,312
You're gonna find something.

125
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,718
Okay?

126
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:31,160
Did you go to the job board
at the intern office?

127
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,286
That ham-faced girl,

128
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,762
you know, in my class?

129
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,426
Yeah, she said there's
good stuff there sometimes.

130
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,763
No, I haven't been yet.

131
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:39,928
Although it would be cool

132
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,596
to get something easy
and under the table.

133
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,970
That's what was so good
about the babysitter thing.

134
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,805
Yeah, but it
could have been awful.

135
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,935
You know?

136
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,240
The kid could be from hell.

137
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,942
You don't even like kids anyway.

138
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,915
Yeah, I guess.

139
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,689
You know what you should do?

140
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,621
You should go around campus

141
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,422
and rip down all of the other
posters he put up,

142
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,758
and then nobody else calls him.

143
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:06,922
How do you like them apples?

144
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,294
That's good payback, right?

145
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,423
Nah.

146
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,593
What?

147
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:11,795
It's genius,

148
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,804
because then nobody else
will show up.

149
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,033
No, I just want to forget it.

150
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,165
No more drama.

151
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,973
All right, then.

152
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,304
You want to go?

153
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,111
Yeah.

154
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,096
Get a grip.

155
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,649
What the hell time is it?

156
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,784
Night.

157
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,285
Oh, shit.

158
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,720
Where's your friend?

159
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,293
Who cares?

160
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,996
Ugh.

161
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,144
Someone called for you.

162
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,736
Who?

163
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,405
I don't know.

164
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,986
Some dude, some guy.

165
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,487
I left his number on your desk.

166
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,363
Where?
Where did you put it?

167
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,023
Chill out.
It's there.

168
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,725
I just-

169
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,858
I don't know.

170
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:09,167
By your pens, maybe.

171
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,175
When was this?

172
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,415
Please leave a message
after the beep.

173
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,554
Hello, this is
Samantha Hughes again.

174
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,957
I got a message that you called.

175
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,119
Samantha?

176
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,390
Yes?

177
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,363
Oh, thank goodness you called.

178
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,560
Quite frankly,
I didn't think you would.

179
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,965
I'm so sorry about this morning.

180
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,366
Things were very hectic for me,

181
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,963
and I got caught up in lots
of last-minute details.

182
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,939
It was a bit of a catastrophe.

183
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,568
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

184
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,374
I spoke with another girl
this morning

185
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,743
who I thought was going
to work out,

186
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:54,045
but she turned out to be
totally unreliable.

187
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,642
And while I can
certainly understand

188
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,483
you being upset with me,
I must be honest,

189
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,455
I'm in dire need of someone.

190
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,253
You mean tonight?

191
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,918
Yes.

192
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,154
It's very important.

193
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,764
Um-

194
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,332
I will pay you double
what I would have normally.

195
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,402
That's $100.

196
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,765
It's very simple.

197
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,168
It wouldn't take even
much of your time.

198
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:19,334
We would be home soon
after midnight.

199
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,467
Are you there?

200
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:25,140
Yes, um...

201
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,273
Okay.

202
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,407
I think I can do it.

203
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,612
Oh, thank goodness.

204
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,017
You're saving me.

205
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,420
And I promise to make this
as painless for you as possible.

206
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,514
That's okay.

207
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,957
I can always use the money.

208
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,288
Of course.

209
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:41,422
Let me give you the address.

210
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,691
- Hey.
- Hey.

211
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,856
Thanks for the ride.

212
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,127
I'm just your monkey
with a cigarette.

213
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,224
Okay.

214
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,709
The whole kit and caboodle
kicks off tonight

215
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,183
just after 10:30.

216
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,753
I know it's late
for some of you folks,

217
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:37,877
but stay up.

218
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,251
It's worth it.

219
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,655
Be sure to find a good spot
where you can see the sky.

220
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,756
Ugh.

221
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,491
I'm so sick of hearing
about that stupid eclipse.

222
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,398
It's, like, all anybody
can ever talk about.

223
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,026
They're like, "Oh, gosh.

224
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,731
"Are you gonna go see
the eclipse tonight? Buh."

225
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,010
Oh, God.

226
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,342
You know, it's not like
the moon's gonna explode.

227
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:06,110
Although that would be
pretty cool.

228
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:10,686
So do you want me
to come with you?

229
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,757
I don't have to see
Mark tonight.

230
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,791
He hates me anyway.

231
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,587
No, it's okay.

232
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,754
But I feel a little weird,
you know,

233
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,799
just dropping you out here
in, like,

234
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:28,804
in the middle of Jabib
or wherever we are.

235
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,068
I mean, I had to look at a map.

236
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,199
Well, don't worry.

237
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,300
I'm gonna be fine.

238
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,538
Okay.

239
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:39,606
Okay, but I have
to tell you something.

240
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,777
But you got to promise that
you're not gonna get mad at me.

241
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,910
What?

242
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,420
All right,
you can't get mad at me.

243
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:46,546
You got to promise.

244
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,489
- No.
- No-

245
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,924
I don't even know
what it is yet.

246
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:54,054
God-okay.

247
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,298
Where did you get these?

248
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,463
I'm sorry.

249
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,130
You were upset, and I felt bad.

250
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,264
Megan.

251
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:05,433
I know, I know.

252
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,566
I'm sorry.

253
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:07,770
But look, like,

254
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,505
it was-it was like,

255
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,240
he was such a jerk
for standing you up.

256
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,407
Yes, he was.

257
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,109
And you were super bummed out.

258
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,241
You were.

259
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,685
And, like, we had
a really good idea.

260
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,290
And I know that you
weren't gonna do it,

261
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,482
so I had to do it, man.

262
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,024
And I didn't know
he was gonna call you.

263
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,149
How could I have known that?

264
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,128
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

265
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,859
Well, now I know why
I got the job.

266
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,832
Nobody else called.

267
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,131
Just please let me
stay with you.

268
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,830
Please let me stay with you.

269
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,771
I will be so good.

270
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,367
I won't touch anything
or eat their food.

271
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,501
I won't take your money.

272
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,635
I just-well, I'll be there,

273
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:43,873
and we'll, like, hang out.

274
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,779
All right, okay.
I heard you the first 50 times.

275
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,876
Can I come, then?

276
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,851
Let's just wait
and see how it goes.

277
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,854
They could be nice.
You don't know.

278
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,117
No, I do know.

279
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,989
Normal people do not pull
the kind of stuff

280
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,617
that those people
pulled with you today.

281
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:58,787
They just don't.

282
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,023
Look who's talking.

283
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,723
That's different.

284
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,028
People make mistakes.
It happens.

285
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,394
I mean, hey, they live

286
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,527
all the way out here
in the country.

287
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,832
So they're at least
normal enough

288
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,168
to have real jobs
that pay tons of money.

289
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:13,209
You think having lots of money
makes you normal?

290
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:17,714
You've clearly never met
my family.

291
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,409
Well, we'll see.

292
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,654
Yes, we will.

293
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,532
Hey, yo, check it.

294
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:12,432
Volvo.

295
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,096
Safest car on the road.

296
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,206
Holy crap.

297
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,505
Hi.

298
00:26:56,648 --> 00:27:03,417
I'm Samantha,
the babysitter.

299
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,251
This is my friend, Megan.

300
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,916
Vincent Ulman.

301
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:11,621
Very nice to meet you both.

302
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,822
Such beautiful girls.

303
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,467
Please come inside.

304
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,223
Have a seat.

305
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,170
You're a doll for agreeing
to this.

306
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:57,535
I mean it.

307
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,644
Oh, it's nothing, really.

308
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,076
I can't tell you how much
of a relief it'll be

309
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,703
to get this night behind us.

310
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,749
You know, we only arrived
in town very recently,

311
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,910
and we really haven't had
a moment to spare,

312
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:12,683
you know, what with the eclipse
and all.

313
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,918
So are you a teacher
or something?

314
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,722
No.

315
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,557
I mean, not exactly.

316
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,926
Just-did you know
both of you live

317
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,398
in one of the most perfect
places on Earth

318
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,025
to get a clear view
of it tonight?

319
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,072
We heard.

320
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,574
Yeah, this place is quite
the astronomer's dream.

321
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,043
Are you an astronomer?

322
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,115
No, not exactly.

323
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,046
Samantha, could I have
a word with you

324
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:45,248
in the other room, please?

325
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,382
Um... sure.

326
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,486
I hope you don't have
a problem,

327
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,488
but you have to understand
that I am only paying one person

328
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:20,648
for their time.

329
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,783
Oh, yeah.

330
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,588
No, Megan's not staying.

331
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,060
She's just my ride.

332
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:30,567
I don't have a car,
so she was just dropping me off.

333
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:31,828
Oh, good.

334
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,332
And please forgive me
for sounding rude.

335
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:40,433
It's just that my wife
is very on edge

336
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,672
about this whole situation.

337
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:44,839
You're not being rude.

338
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:48,783
I understand.

339
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,014
Unfortunately, no,
I'm afraid you don't.

340
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,852
Excuse me?

341
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,460
Please sit down.

342
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,355
You have to forgive me,
Samantha,

343
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:08,431
because I've not been
completely honest.

344
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:12,024
You see,
we actually don't have a child.

345
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,204
We have a child, but he's grown.

346
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,538
This job tonight
is not for a child

347
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,338
but for my wife's mother.

348
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,081
Oh.

349
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,204
Hear me out.

350
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,080
Mr. Ulman, um,

351
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,551
I don't have any experience
with anything like that.

352
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,178
I think maybe you should find-

353
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,053
Okay, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

354
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,185
I didn't mean to-

355
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,193
Listen, this is not anything
like you're imagining.

356
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,734
There's nothing medical

357
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,200
that you would
have to do whatsoever.

358
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,932
In fact, you don't have to do
much of anything and...

359
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,640
I find this all a bit awkward.

360
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,971
But you have to understand
I have only the best intentions.

361
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,273
I've been putting advertisements
out for the past two weeks

362
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,472
to get someone for tonight.

363
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:59,207
But nobody responds
to elderly assistants

364
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,750
or home care anymore.

365
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:06,721
So I thought maybe "babysitter"
would get a better response.

366
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,314
But to be honest,
it didn't do much.

367
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,326
And like I said on the phone,
I only got one other girl.

368
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:15,899
And when I told her the truth,
she backed out, so...

369
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,401
I mean, I figure
it's all the horror stories

370
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,064
that you read in the paper
and see on TV

371
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:25,939
that have scared away
girls of your age

372
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,672
from these types
of opportunities.

373
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,647
Yeah, there's a lot
of weirdoes out there.

374
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,150
You're right.

375
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,188
And I sincerely apologize
for being dishonest,

376
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,019
but what I'm asking of you
is not that different

377
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,319
than what you expected.

378
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,361
It's essentially
just like babysitting.

379
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,420
I'm sorry.

380
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,624
I appreciate your situation.

381
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:49,790
I do.

382
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,526
Okay, what will it take?

383
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:02,040
How about if I gave you
another $100?

384
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,544
Okay, okay.

385
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,950
$200.

386
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,489
That's $300 for one night.

387
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,649
Please.

388
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,283
You have no idea
how important this is.

389
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,323
$400.

390
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,004
Hey.

391
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,976
Megan.

392
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,069
Jeez, come on.

393
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,204
Hold on.

394
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,373
Megan.

395
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,506
Come on, wait a second.

396
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,346
Are you out of your mind?

397
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,681
Do you remember the game plan?

398
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,482
The game plan was,
if they're weird, we leave.

399
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,989
This is beyond weird.
It's mental.

400
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,218
You know, they lied to you.
They lied to you.

401
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,657
- I know, okay.
- They're liars.

402
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:51,820
I know you're right.

403
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,055
But it's $400.

404
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,758
It's $400 for four hours.

405
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,528
This equals first month's rent
and then some,

406
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,694
and all I have to do
is sit inside and watch TV.

407
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:01,896
It's too good to be true.

408
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,203
Did you ever think
it is too good to be true?

409
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,435
Megan, please.

410
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,374
I need the money.

411
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:12,882
It's so stupid.

412
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,713
Ugh.

413
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,616
I'm so mad at you.

414
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,723
Look, you're being
a great friend right now.

415
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,085
But this is huge.

416
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,193
This one night changes
everything for me.

417
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:25,753
Come on.
It's only a few hours.

418
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,387
That's it.

419
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,693
Just promise me you'll be here
by 12:30, and then it's over.

420
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:30,790
Just promise me.

421
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,699
Okay, fine, fine.

422
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,794
12:30, right?

423
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,634
Okay, yeah.

424
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,645
Oh, God, Sam.

425
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,779
You can be such
a fucking idiot sometimes.

426
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Oh, my God!

427
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,047
Oh, my God.

428
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,658
Oh, my gosh,
you scared the crap out of me.

429
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,350
Take it easy.

430
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,483
I'm sorry.

431
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,153
I didn't mean to scare you.

432
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,198
I just thought you could use
a light, is all.

433
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,198
So sue me for being helpful.

434
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,666
I almost just died.

435
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:13,861
Oh, my God.

436
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,632
I almost just had a heart attack
and died.

437
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,834
Here.
You do it.

438
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,307
It's safer.

439
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,672
Thanks.

440
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:33,485
All better?

441
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,583
Aces.

442
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:42,830
It's freezing out here.

443
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,926
Okay.

444
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,836
Where the hell
did you come from?

445
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,501
Did you just hide?

446
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,246
Are you-are you not
the babysitter?

447
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,372
No, I'm not the babysitter.
My friend-

448
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,615
See, here we are.

449
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,659
Half your payment in advance

450
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,728
just to ease your mind.

451
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,798
And here's a little more
to get something to eat.

452
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,263
There's a number
on the refrigerator

453
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,890
for a pizza place.

454
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,402
I know you college kids
love pizza.

455
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:54,971
Mom is asleep,
and as I said before,

456
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,074
there's really no need
for concern.

457
00:37:57,174 --> 00:38:00,473
She's old, but she's actually
quite able-bodied,

458
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,739
actually
more able-bodied than...

459
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:04,837
than myself, I hate to say.

460
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,574
But if she needs anything,

461
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:07,776
she'll be able to get it
herself.

462
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:08,976
She's quite independent.

463
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,417
Most likely,
you won't even see her.

464
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:11,783
But you need to be alert

465
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,288
just in the off chance
that there's an emergency.

466
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,414
You understand.

467
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:16,754
Mm-hmm.

468
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,590
I mean, this is mostly
for my wife's benefit.

469
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,755
She's, you know,
the paranoid type.

470
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:21,923
But you get it.

471
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,160
It all sounds easy enough
to handle.

472
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,291
Terrific.

473
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,425
Oh, right.

474
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:29,199
There's-

475
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,308
It's the number where we'll be

476
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,636
just in case you need us.

477
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,803
Oh, yeah, there's a number
on fridge for pizz-

478
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,538
I already said that, didn't I?

479
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:39,607
Yeah.

480
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:40,775
If this wasn't screwed on...

481
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:43,285
but I've said too much as it is,

482
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,356
so I'm gonna get upstairs
and get the missus.

483
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,891
And you just make yourself
comfortable.

484
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,791
And I'll be back in two shakes
of a lamb's tail.

485
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,889
Okay, thanks.

486
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:21,554
I've done everything
you asked.

487
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,423
Well, there's not going to be
any more mistakes.

488
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,895
No, this one, she's perfect.

489
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,226
We're not missing anything.

490
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,235
After tonight, everything
will finally be complete.

491
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,931
Please stop worrying.

492
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:40,737
I have it all under control.

493
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,098
Are you here for Mother?

494
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,701
Yes, yes, I am.

495
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,794
Wonderful.

496
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,636
You're a godsend.

497
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,745
It's nothing.

498
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:18,747
Not to us, it's not.

499
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:19,975
Well, I'm glad to do it.

500
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,717
Hmm.

501
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:26,816
Vivian Ulman.

502
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:27,946
Samantha.

503
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,081
Sam.

504
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:31,956
Nice to meet you.

505
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,430
What's the matter, Sam?

506
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,157
Oh, nothing.

507
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,494
I just-

508
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:40,661
I thought your husband
went upstairs looking for you,

509
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,569
and I didn't expect to see you
come in from over there.

510
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,609
I just-I get disoriented
sometimes.

511
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:50,578
My friend Megan says
I'm out to lunch.

512
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:51,909
I was downstairs
in the basement

513
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,176
looking for my furs.

514
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:56,343
I just can't get used
to this cold weather.

515
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,648
I love the heat.

516
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,347
We're from the desert, you know.

517
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,480
Oh?

518
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,614
Mm-hmm.

519
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,421
What about you?

520
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,086
Is this your home?

521
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,687
Yeah.

522
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,266
Well, it's more downstate,
but it's pretty much the same.

523
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,927
I don't like the cold
much either.

524
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,595
And now you're in university.

525
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,196
You look awfully young
to be in college.

526
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,673
Everybody says that.

527
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,209
But I'm a sophomore.

528
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,040
Oh, a sophomore.

529
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,704
Wow.

530
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,613
You could have fooled me.

531
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,448
I bet the boys really like you.

532
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:31,612
I guess.

533
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:32,984
Hmm, you guess.

534
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,183
Of course they do.

535
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,795
A fine young beauty like you.

536
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:42,957
I remember when I was your age.

537
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:46,559
Your mother must
worry herself silly.

538
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,001
Here we go.

539
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,811
Ah, you two have met.

540
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,412
Excellent.

541
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,549
Yes, and she's delightful.

542
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,751
I couldn't be more pleased,

543
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,362
and I know that Mother
will feel the same.

544
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:13,656
Good, very good.

545
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:17,165
You see, things are working out
perfectly after all.

546
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,257
And you doubted me.

547
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:19,869
I know.

548
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,938
You were right, and I was wrong.

549
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,835
I'm sorry.

550
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,670
Well, then let's get to it.

551
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,210
Mustn't let the night
get away from us.

552
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:29,505
Isn't that right, Samantha?

553
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,547
That's right.

554
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:34,674
Oh, and Mother
is very private.

555
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,343
So don't be put off by it.

556
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:37,715
It's just her way.

557
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,015
Don't worry.

558
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,523
I warned her about both of you.

559
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:49,096
You did, did you?

560
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,864
Oh, yeah, don't forget
the pizza on the refrigerator.

561
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,016
Hello?

562
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,287
Hey.

563
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:28,957
Oh, I'm not actually here.

564
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,967
But leave me a message,
and I'll call you right back.

565
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,416
Hello?

566
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:56,822
Oh, I'm not actually here.

567
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,862
But leave me a message,
and I'll call you right back.

568
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:00,986
Beep!

569
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:04,261
Megan, it's me.
Pick up.

570
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:07,529
You're still not home yet?

571
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:11,437
Sorry if you're mad.

572
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:12,701
All right, I'll call you back.

573
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,276
It's not that bad.

574
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,402
Just hurry up and be home.

575
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,471
Pizza Pizza.
What you eating?

576
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,732
Yeah, hi.

577
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,831
I'd like to place an order
for delivery.

578
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:22,468
Okay, your address?

579
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,275
Uh, one second.

580
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:34,921
Uh, it is...
7714 East Beaumont.

581
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,686
East Beaumont?

582
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,852
Very cool.

583
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,486
What can I get for you?

584
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,655
Extra anchovies?

585
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:45,197
No, just a small pizza
with pepperoni.

586
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:46,632
We don't have small.

587
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,169
Only medium and large.

588
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,102
Okay, medium is fine.

589
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,538
All right.

590
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:54,143
One medium pep.

591
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:57,179
That's going to be eight bucks.

592
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,508
Okay, thank you.

593
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,173
No, thank you.

594
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,309
See you in 30.

595
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,255
Hello, fish.

596
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,406
Good evening.
I'm Elaine Cross.

597
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:08,636
And I'm Ted Stephen.

598
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,939
And welcome back
to Channel 13 News.

599
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:14,107
Tonight's big eclipse
is now well under way.

600
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,582
It is a total lunar eclipse,

601
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:19,485
which I'm told means up to
two hours of no moon visibility.

602
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:20,715
But more than half the moon

603
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,815
has already entered
the Earth's shadow.

604
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:24,893
Observers from all over
the Western Hemisphere

605
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:27,156
are watching
this spectacular event.

606
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,424
In fact, it's visible
from every continent

607
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,591
this side of the globe,
except Antarctica.

608
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,635
The best time to see
this fascinating event

609
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,635
will be just about
the stroke of midnight.

610
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,637
That's when you'll be able
to see the moon itself

611
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,504
actually disappear
into the Earth's shadow.

612
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,009
And that's it for us tonight.

613
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,737
Stay tuned
for a special presentation

614
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,111
of Frightmare Theatre
coming up next.

615
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:47,238
Ooh, scary.

616
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,408
Good night for a movie.

617
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:49,746
Get the popcorn ready.

618
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:52,515
I like mine with butter.

619
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:17,959
Shit.

620
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:34,008
Man.

621
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:36,015
Frickin' idiot.

622
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,139
Huh.

623
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,012
I thought she said
these were in the basement.

624
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,550
Hey, yo, check it.

625
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,883
Volvo.

626
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,090
Hello?

627
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:31,490
Oh, I'm not actually here.

628
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,789
But leave me a message
and I'll-

629
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:05,150
Get a grip.

630
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:30,710
Hello?

631
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:33,907
Mrs. Ulman?

632
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:37,042
Shit.

633
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:55,854
Is everything all right
in there?

634
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

635
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:30,785
Keep the change.

636
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:36,296
Have a good night, ma'am.

637
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,595
You too.

638
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:47,558
We're sorry.

639
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:49,193
Your call cannot be completed
as dialed.

640
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,499
Please check the number
and dial again

641
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,631
or call your operator-

642
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:04,018
It's okay.

643
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:05,586
Everything's fine.

644
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:07,985
She's fine.

645
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:11,253
Just relax.

646
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:14,488
Just get a grip.

647
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,087
Get a grip.

648
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,427
Megan?

649
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,902
This is Gloria
with emergency services.

650
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,436
We received a call
from this address.

651
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:28,873
I'm sorry.

652
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:31,411
I thought I hung up
before it connected.

653
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,573
Do you have an emergency?

654
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:35,706
No.

655
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:36,840
Everything is fine.

656
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:38,920
I didn't mean to call.

657
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,079
All right, then.

658
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,689
Well, please remember
that this line

659
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:43,952
is reserved
for emergencies only.

660
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:45,117
Yeah, I know.

661
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,250
It was an accident.

662
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,384
I'm sorry.

663
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,691
Okay, have a good night, then.

664
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:52,791
Thanks.

665
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:37,629
Ugh.

666
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,475
Ugh.

667
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

668
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,665
Get her!

669
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:53,287
My eye!
My eye!

670
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:54,479
My eye!

671
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:06,257
Megan!

672
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:17,811
Ah!

673
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,926
There you are.

674
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,413
It's happening.

675
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,345
No matter what you do,
it won't stop.

676
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:36,347
It can't be stopped.

677
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:38,475
You'll see.

678
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:41,612
It's gonna work in spite of you,
you little bitch.

679
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,165
Talk to me, lord.

680
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:56,031
Talk to me.

681
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:57,661
Please.

682
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:02,203
Talk to me.

683
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:04,539
Please, lord.

684
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:09,116
I beg you.

685
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

686
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:32,124
Samantha, wait!

687
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:23,975
Samantha, listen to me.

688
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,108
Get away from me!

689
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:26,242
Just stop.

690
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:27,412
Just speak with me.

691
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:29,353
Stay back!

692
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:30,924
All right.

693
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:32,754
You don't need to do that.

694
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:39,361
What have you done to me?

695
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:41,795
They're calling to you.

696
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:44,166
Just listen to them.

697
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:51,603
He's given the sign.

698
01:25:51,713 --> 01:25:53,704
He's chosen you.

699
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:55,543
It's your destiny to accept him.

700
01:25:55,683 --> 01:25:56,843
No!

701
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:02,548
Okay, go ahead.
Go ahead.

702
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:03,952
Kill me if you want.

703
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:07,653
I'm just a messenger
who carries out his words.

704
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:15,836
Only moments away now.

705
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:27,341
No, no!

706
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:41,652
Astronomers everywhere
are still baffled

707
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:43,822
by how to explain
the bizarre event.

708
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:45,763
It seems that the speed at which

709
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,561
the moon exited
the Earth's shadow

710
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:50,432
was faster than believed
theoretically possible.

711
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:52,699
And while this may be
intriguing to many,

712
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,331
scientists around the globe
cannot agree

713
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:57,274
on exactly why this occurred.

714
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:59,937
But experts are working hard
searching for answers,

715
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:02,709
and we will keep you informed
of any and all developments

716
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:05,842
as they come in.

717
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:44,545
Poor thing.

718
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:45,675
Don't worry.

719
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:50,519
You're gonna be just fine.

720
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:53,525
Both of you.
