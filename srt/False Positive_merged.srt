00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,118
Well... womp-womp.

3
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,798
Hey, come on.

4
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,398
Stop it.

5
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,440
I can't.

6
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,158
I-I can't.

7
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,758
I just wanted it to be natural.

8
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,240
It will be natural.
Just let me call him.

9
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,278
Look, he's one of the top five
fertility specialists

10
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,200
in the world.

11
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,398
As a woman,
this is the one thing

12
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,878
I'm supposed to be able to do,
and I can't do it.

13
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,120
Well, let's just find out
if we can get pregnant.

14
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,518
And if we can't, then, you know,
we'll blow the college fund

15
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,838
on some of the best vacations
of our lives.

16
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,358
Call him.

17
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,358
Really?

18
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,520
Oh.

19
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,680
Oh.

20
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,318
You're gonna love him.

21
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,840
Wow.

22
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,038
- Hello.
- Hi.

23
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,398
- Hi.
- You must be Lucia and Adrian.

24
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,840
- Yes.
- Um, I go by Lucy, but...

25
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,158
Can we get a name change
from "Lucia" to "Lucy," please?

26
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,438
Oh.

27
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,478
I'm Dr. Hindle's
head nurse, Dawn.

28
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,358
Let me just get you started
with some paperless paperwork.

29
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,678
And Rita...

30
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,518
can help out with refreshments.

31
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,558
Do you want a, uh,
espresso or something?

32
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,318
Sure.

33
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,758
Enjoy it while you can.

34
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,280
Go ahead.
Take a seat.

35
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,278
I'm changing
the file name now.

36
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,480
Thank you.

37
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,720
Here.
Rita recommended that for you.

38
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,798
Mmm.

39
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,878
Gonna be good.

40
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,478
Adrian.

41
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,518
Hey.

42
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,918
So nice to see you.

43
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,558
Yeah, it's been a long time,
hasn't it?

44
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,638
Yes, it has indeed.
Hello, Lucy.

45
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,278
- Hi.
- Lovely to meet you.

46
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,358
Such a pleasure to meet you.

47
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,080
So... you two need
a little help.

48
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,198
- Uh, y-yeah.
- Yeah.

49
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,238
We've been trying pretty hard
for two years.

50
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,598
Yes. I know.
Adrian told me.

51
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,198
I don't get it.

52
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,438
I... thought I have been
doing everything right.

53
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,558
I eat well.
I exercise.

54
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,920
I haven't even had a drink
for two years.

55
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,278
I don't want you
to have to question

56
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,278
everything you're doing.

57
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,398
I will give you
the best possible chance

58
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,358
of getting pregnant.

59
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,918
How does that sound?

60
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,318
That sounds great.

61
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,400
Good.

62
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,840
Oh, thank you, Dawn.

63
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,040
Hm.

64
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,558
Did you know that Adrian

65
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,158
was the most talented surgeon
I ever taught?

66
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,478
Oh, God.
Stop it.

67
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,198
There was this one woman,

68
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,078
she had breast cancer,
and the hospital wouldn't pay

69
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,718
for a post-mastectomy
augmentation.

70
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,438
So your husband,

71
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,238
he just goes and does it
without telling anyone.

72
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,198
Well, I-I told <i>her.</i>

73
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,238
Yes, and the board wanted
me to let you go.

74
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,598
I told them, "If he goes, I go."

75
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,720
I was sick of teaching at
the hospital anyway, so I quit.

76
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,358
We should've started our own
practice right then and there.

77
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,078
Yeah. Would've been great.
Lot of work, though.

78
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,398
Mm, I know it's hard.

79
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,878
Sometimes I wish
I could clone myself.

80
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,318
It's the only way
I'd get the job done.

81
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,598
Okay.

82
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,878
- Your architecture is great.
- Oh.

83
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,598
Problem is low hCG levels.

84
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,238
We'll give you a little boost
post- and pre-insemination,

85
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
monitor your numbers from there.

86
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,680
That's it?

87
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,638
Yes.

88
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,038
Really?

89
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,598
I've just been tested
so many times.

90
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,038
All these women...

91
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,718
All these women here
had troubles.

92
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,200
Some... Some worse than you.

93
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,120
All happy mums I've sent home
with babies.

94
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,078
We have IUI and IVF.

95
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,158
IVF makes babies in a test tube.

96
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,838
IUI makes them inside of you.

97
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,638
I've invented a method
that's a little of both.

98
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,398
I like to call it, um,
in utero Hindle fertilization.

99
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,118
You can help me with that one,

100
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,358
as you're the marketing genius.

101
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,878
Okay.

102
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,998
Oh.
Well, then, thank you, John.

103
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,678
- It's a pleasure.
- Yeah.

104
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,438
Thank you so much, Dr. Hindle.
Thank you.

105
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,000
Luce? Got five?

106
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,600
Dirk's considering making you
lead on the Wyth account.

107
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,638
Oh, my God!

108
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,358
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

109
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,238
Mihail's managing four clients.

110
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,998
I've got six, and I was like,
"What about Lucy?"

111
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,798
Greg, you said that?

112
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,638
Thank you so much.

113
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,438
Of course.

114
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,558
He wants to see Bryon's ideas
before pulling the trigger.

115
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,838
Of course.

116
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,278
But you're what this pitch
needs.

117
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,478
Some female intuition.

118
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,878
Although I like to think I cover
a little of that myself.

119
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,678
Now, if this works out,

120
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,638
it's gonna come
with more responsibility.

121
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,120
Travel, more money.

122
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,638
Luce, I'm fighting for you.

123
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,438
Also... I'm thinking
Dig In for lunch.

124
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,478
What do you think?

125
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,078
I'm obsessed with Dig In.

126
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,518
- I'll start an order.
- Great.

127
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,158
I'm gonna do the, uh,
grilled tofu market bowl

128
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,798
and a side
of wilted beet greens.

129
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,758
- Yum. I'm gonna do the same.
- Mm.

130
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,238
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

131
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,158
No.
Uh... thank you.

132
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,278
Okay.

133
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,158
Lucy, would you like to watch?

134
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,000
- Oh. No.
- Here you go.

135
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,398
Perfect.

136
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,678
Okay.

137
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,358
Okay.

138
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,198
- Mm.
- Rita.

139
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,598
Good work, son.

140
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,238
This is powerful stuff.

141
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,398
Mm.

142
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,198
Oh.

143
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,878
Brilliant.

144
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,920
Hmm.

145
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,678
She looks like a smart shopper.

146
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,158
Why are you fighting me
on this?

147
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,320
Okay, Luce,
what do you think of her?

148
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,438
She's kind of too runway.

149
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,558
I think of Wyth as more
"girl on the subway" hot.

150
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,038
Thank you.
That's what I said.

151
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,078
We need subway hot, not runway.

152
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,838
Subway hot?

153
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,798
Okay.
What about this one?

154
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,118
Um...

155
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,518
I'll be back in a second.

156
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,438
You are...

157
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,678
100% pregnant.

158
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,078
Oh, my God!

159
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,638
Oh, thank you, Doctor.

160
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,120
Oh, my God.

161
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,918
Oh, my God. Thank you.

162
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,238
Thank you, Dr. Hindle.

163
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,878
Come on. Stop it.

164
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,998
I'm almost done.

165
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,400
Alright.

166
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,438
You go.

167
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,318
- After all that?
- Yes.

168
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,360
Okay. Fine.

169
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,878
If we have a girl...

170
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,280
Mm-hmm.

171
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,398
...Wendy.

172
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,438
Oh, Luce.

173
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,038
That's perfect.

174
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,158
We can make Wendy
a little Peter Pan costume,

175
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,478
in honor of your mom.

176
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,718
- That would be nice.
- Mm.

177
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,078
Okay.

178
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,518
I'm only gonna do boys' names
from now on.

179
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,840
Okay.

180
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,278
What about...

181
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,680
Adrian?

182
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,238
As in Junior?

183
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,120
Kind of cool, right?

184
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,238
Hey.

185
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,998
Um, I will take orders
in just a couple minutes, um,

186
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,758
but I wanted to talk to you
about something.

187
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,518
Sure.

188
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,560
Are you, uh, feeling nervous
about the pitch?

189
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,638
Actually, I wanted
to let you know that I...

190
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,718
am pregnant.

191
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,638
I knew it!

192
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,158
I seriously have some sort

193
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,918
of women's-intuition thing
going on.

194
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,838
You have been glowing!

195
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,638
Oh. Thank you.

196
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,398
Alright.
What's up?

197
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,798
- Oh.
- Tell him.

198
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,158
Go on, tell him.

199
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,678
Okay.

200
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,118
I'm pregnant.

201
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,918
- Yes!
- Aww!

202
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,158
No wonder you've been glowing.

203
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,678
That's what I just said!

204
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,558
I literally said that
to my wife last night.

205
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,798
I was like, "Lucy is glowing."

206
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,718
You guys, thank you.
That's so sweet.

207
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,078
Hey, let's get
a really good lunch today.

208
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,440
Whatever you want.
Even better than Dig In.

209
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,800
What about Wyth?

210
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,038
You know,
it might not be a bad idea

211
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,678
to let them know
you're expecting.

212
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,598
Make them feel bad
if they <i>don't</i> hire us.

213
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,838
Yeah, and, I mean,
if you're not showing by then,

214
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,518
we'll just plump you up
with a pillow.

215
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,118
Yeah.
Wyth has really nice pillows.

216
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,680
That's right.

217
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,158
Mm-hmm.
Thank you, Dawn.

218
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,440
Oh.
Wonderful, wonderful.

219
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,398
Hm.

220
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,718
Right.
Here we go.

221
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,398
Oh, my God.

222
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,678
Is that a...

223
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,040
Yep.

224
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,798
And there's the second.

225
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,598
Twin set.

226
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,880
Males.

227
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,718
We have twin boys!

228
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,838
Twins.

229
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,280
And... the third.

230
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,840
Female singlet.

231
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,158
Wow.

232
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,118
Just relax.

233
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,480
Just relax.
Water, please.

234
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,398
Relax.

235
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,398
This is absolutely normal

236
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,518
for how aggressive we boosted
your numbers.

237
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,038
I was not gonna send you home
empty-handed.

238
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,638
So, we've got twin boys
and a female singlet,

239
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,998
total of three.

240
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,358
Now...

241
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,478
selective reduction.

242
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,518
Far be it from me
to tell you what to do,

243
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,798
but with your history
and these elevated numbers,

244
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,038
we're looking at an increase
of possible complications.

245
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,520
Preemies or,
worse, miscarriage.

246
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,598
By reduction, uh, you mean...

247
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,238
an abortion?

248
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,158
We'd be making a sacrifice
to ensure a successful birth.

249
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,640
Either the boys, because they
share the same sac, or the girl.

250
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,438
Now, I would strongly recommend
we keep the boys.

251
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,518
They look healthy.
And the girl?

252
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,760
Well, she's a bit small.

253
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,400
Um...

254
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,998
C... Uh...

255
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,198
Could we...

256
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,398
Like, is there...

257
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,838
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

258
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,118
I-I just don't want to make
the wrong choice.

259
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,038
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.

260
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,078
I will not let that happen.

261
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,758
Yeah.

262
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,240
The odds of you having a baby
have just increased 100%.

263
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,998
But yes.

264
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,678
You do have a decision to make.

265
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,918
Thank you.

266
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,518
Adrian, can I have a word?

267
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,798
Okay.

268
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,318
I know, sweetie.

269
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,158
It's a lot to think about.

270
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,560
Yeah.
Thanks.

271
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,760
I heard we have
a celebration this evening.

272
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,678
We did it.

273
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,918
I'm pregnant.

274
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,640
Yes, we're pregnant.

275
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,878
Come on.

276
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,280
It's expensive.

277
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,478
Do you want to talk about it?

278
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,758
I'm still processing
the whole thing.

279
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,438
Aren't you?

280
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,118
Yeah.

281
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,838
But I agree with Dr. Hindle.

282
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,640
I think we should have the boys.

283
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,718
You do?

284
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,238
You said you've always wanted
a sibling.

285
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,798
You know, a lot of your quirks
are from being an only child.

286
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,918
Uh...

287
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,838
Two at once is a lot.

288
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,800
Look.

289
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,118
What do you think
the chances are

290
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,640
of us being able
to get pregnant again?

291
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,078
Slim.

292
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,878
I-I'm saying that for myself,

293
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,558
'cause I'm getting
up there, too.

294
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,198
What about Wyth?

295
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,118
I'll just take on more clients
if you want to quit work.

296
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,638
I don't want to stop working.
I'm just starting to get ahead.

297
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,558
Babe, we've always talked
about having more than one.

298
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,278
Yeah, that was before
we couldn't have <i>any.</i>

299
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,880
Yeah, which is why I'm saying
that we should have...

300
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,680
You asked me my opinion,
so I gave it to you.

301
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,000
I want the girl.

302
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,438
I've always seen her,

303
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,158
pictured us lying together
in bed, staring at each other.

304
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:20,118
And she would see through me
with these clear eyes,

305
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,680
right past me to some
better version of myself.

306
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,720
Come here.

307
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,838
I hear everything
that you're saying.

308
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,038
I just don't want you to regret
your decision.

309
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,358
Are you serious?

310
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,838
Would you like to hear
this evening's specials?

311
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,398
Uh, yes.
That would be great.

312
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,078
Tonight we have
a pan-roasted duck.

313
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,998
It is in a persimmon glaze

314
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,998
served with a side of roasted
local root vegetables.

315
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,998
We also have a homemade
tagliatelle pasta

316
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,758
with black-pepper cream sauce
with foraged mushrooms on top.

317
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,800
I'm sorry
if I made you feel bad.

318
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,520
It's okay.

319
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,120
Let's have Wendy.

320
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,558
It's what you want.

321
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,598
Are you sure?

322
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,718
I mean, if you are.

323
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,438
Oh.

324
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,440
Thank you. I love you.

325
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,680
I love you, too.

326
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,360
What?

327
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,480
John wants me to present him
with some big award.

328
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,278
Probably just wants to embarrass
me with a story or whatever,

329
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,278
but...

330
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,838
Well, you have to do it.

331
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,598
That's some real exposure.

332
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,718
Yeah, then I have to write
a speech, then I have to...

333
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,158
I'll write it for you.
Duh.

334
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,318
Are you serious?

335
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,558
Of course.

336
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,078
He got us pregnant.

337
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,478
You owe him.

338
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,558
- Yeah.
LUCY:

339
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,920
Well, can't argue with that.

340
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,278
Lucy, you're not gonna be
doing this on your own.

341
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,758
You should join a mommy group
or something.

342
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,918
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah.

343
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,758
I wish one of my friends
was pregnant.

344
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,598
You know, Eden doesn't even have
that boyfriend anymore,

345
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,718
and Alyson is like...

346
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,198
Alyson's Alyson.

347
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,118
Come on.

348
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,598
You know you love them.

349
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,718
They're just...

350
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,598
Loud?

351
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,000
I was gonna say young,
but they are also loud.

352
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,678
Mm.

353
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,478
So then I got into
part-time food styling.

354
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,278
I was just like, "Fuck it."

355
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,878
- That's awesome.
- Good for you.

356
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,598
- Yeah.
- That's great.

357
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,678
Um, well, I'm Corgan.

358
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,558
Uh, I'm a paralegal,

359
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,278
and I'm 17 weeks pregnant
with Rafe,

360
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,038
like "Ralph" but French.

361
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,718
Oh. Cute.

362
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,598
My husband, Brad, is a lawyer
at Goldman, in house.

363
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,718
Um, and we're just so excited.

364
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,638
We did a bunch of rounds of IVF,

365
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,358
and, you know,
third time's the charm.

366
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,998
- Oh.
- Oh.

367
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,278
We tried two times,
and this one finally stuck.

368
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,638
Good, good.

369
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,918
I kind of went
a little off the deep end.

370
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,078
Mommy brain is a real thing.

371
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,878
Oh, girl.

372
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,358
We did IVF, too.

373
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,678
Oh.
Who'd you go to?

374
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,358
The Hindle Women's Center.

375
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,438
Oh, my God.

376
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,518
I was on a wait list there
for a year and a half

377
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,678
before we gave up.

378
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,318
Oh. Wow.

379
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,438
Can I ask how long
you had to wait?

380
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,918
Um, I actually didn't

381
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,038
because my husband, uh, was
his student in medical school.

382
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,278
- Oh, my God. How lucky.
- Wow.

383
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,078
Well, what kind of doctor
is he?

384
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,638
Adrian is a reconstructive
surgeon at Sloan Kettering.

385
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,638
Uh, does he do
mommy makeovers?

386
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,318
Yeah.

387
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,038
Can you get, like,
a Hindle C-section

388
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,678
<i>and</i> a tummy tuck
all in one shot?

389
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,238
I never thought about that,
but I'm gonna ask him.

390
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,598
I would really like
to get in on that plan, right?

391
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,398
- Uh, yeah.
- Can we get a family discount?

392
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,798
Yeah. But you're so tiny,
you probably won't even need it.

393
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,838
- Oh.
- You are gonna be huge!

394
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,520
Thank you.

395
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,278
Lucy.

396
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,800
Are you ready?

397
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,680
Yeah.

398
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,078
There's no need
to be worried, Lucy.

399
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,718
I've done this procedure
thousands of times

400
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,398
over the past 30 years.

401
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,198
Dr. Hindle is an innovator
in the field.

402
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,598
You are with truly the best
in the biz.

403
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,198
I swear I didn't tell her
to say that.

404
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,438
You are in good...

405
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,118
and hopefully warm hands.

406
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,238
Okay.

407
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,518
You're gonna feel
a little pinch.

408
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,080
Just breathe deeply.

409
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,400
Very good.

410
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,318
Breathe.

411
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,118
Deeply.

412
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,798
In through your nose.

413
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,000
And out through your mouth.

414
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,038
Breathe.

415
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,478
I've perfected the technique.

416
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,158
Do you think she can hear us?

417
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,478
No, no, no, no.
She's out cold.

418
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,878
She'll get
her fairy-tale ending.

419
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,720
Wendy.

420
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,318
Wendy, it's time to go,
sweetheart.

421
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

422
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,040
Hey.

423
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,918
You zonked out on us.

424
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,638
How are you feeling?

425
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,198
Okay, I guess.

426
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,998
Well, you can just rest up now.

427
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,358
Lucy, I want you to think
of this as a fresh start.

428
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,478
Okay?

429
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,558
- Okay.
- Good.

430
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,638
Oh, Dawn.

431
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,318
Okay, sweetie.

432
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,918
You might not want to tell
anyone about this.

433
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,078
You know,
there's so much judgment

434
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,278
and misinformation out there.

435
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,918
Yes. You feel free
to call us any time.

436
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,080
Visit any time you wish.

437
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,118
What happens to... the twins?

438
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,678
What do you mean?

439
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,600
The, um... reductions.

440
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,758
Reduced fetuses
attach to the placenta

441
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,560
and get extracted
with the afterbirth.

442
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,638
So they won't affect Wendy?

443
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,118
No.
No, no, no.

444
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,078
She's all taken care of.

445
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,438
Thank you so much, Doctor.

446
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,438
Oh.
Let's have a hug, shall we?

447
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,358
There we go.

448
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,760
Mm!

449
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,718
You rest now.
Adrian?

450
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,598
- Thanks, man.
- Yes.

451
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,038
Good man.
Good man.

452
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,838
And when is she gonna start
calling me John?

453
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,278
- Well, that's up to...
- Oh.

454
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,038
- Thank you, John.
- Bye, now.

455
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,838
Try to enjoy
some quality mom time.

456
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,678
You deserve it.

457
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,360
Remember, you're pregnant.

458
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,838
You know, I...

459
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,998
thought I heard these weird
things during the reduction,

460
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,718
you and Hindle talking about...

461
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,278
I don't know.

462
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,718
Really?

463
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,680
Must've been dreaming.

464
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,278
Right up here, Mohammad.
Thank you.

465
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,998
Yeah.

466
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,720
Yeah.

467
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,598
The Internet is full
of misinformation.

468
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,518
I don't want you
getting paranoid.

469
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:24,478
What you have is called OHSS...
ovarian hyperstimulation.

470
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,878
Actually, it's a good thing.

471
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,518
Your uterus is making room,
so it stretches,

472
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,798
sometimes a little too thin,
and it bleeds.

473
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,680
So you're not concerned?

474
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,240
No.

475
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,518
Now, there'll be
no more googling.

476
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,720
Understood?

477
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,118
The choices Wyth have made
are subtle but powerful,

478
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,638
elevating yourselves in
a marketplace full of basics.

479
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,358
We here at Liegler want to
re-fashion your consumers,

480
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,678
your "fans," as co-creators.

481
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,438
You fucking killed it!

482
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,438
I did, didn't I?

483
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,438
I've known Coraline
for decades,

484
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,598
started a crew together,
and she's a, um...

485
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,798
How do I say it?

486
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,198
Let's say, uh, tepid.

487
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,158
Exactly.
For her to say, "I like it"?

488
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,638
- Wow!
- No, no, no, no.

489
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,798
She said, "I like it <i>very much,"</i>

490
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,558
and that it was very smart.

491
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,838
That's a big compliment
coming from a...

492
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,078
let's say genius.

493
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,198
I didn't even
hear you come in.

494
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,080
Okay.
Guess what.

495
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,558
What?

496
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,358
I nailed the pitch, and
I get to lead the Wyth account.

497
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,678
That's amazing.

498
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,678
Am I gonna be one
of those women who has it all?

499
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,598
My career, my kids,
my old man by my side?

500
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,518
Who you calling old?

501
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,238
Whoo!

502
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,358
Oh, my God.
That's so scary.

503
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,998
Apparently, umbilical cords

504
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,638
are supposed to have
<i>two</i> arteries,

505
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,998
and mine only has <i>one,</i>
because of course it does.

506
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,038
I'm so sorry.

507
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,518
Half the babies born with this

508
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,718
have all sorts
of awful complications.

509
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,678
I mean, horrible things
like deformities.

510
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,838
- Oh, God.
- I just can't...

511
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,518
I just...

512
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,718
Dr. Davis says I essentially
have to be on bed rest

513
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,918
from here on out, which...

514
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,758
I guess is okay,
'cause I can quit now

515
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,758
and not have to waddle into work
for the next five months.

516
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,878
You're... You're gonna quit?

517
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,358
Oh, Brad and I decided.

518
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,758
I mean, if something happened
to baby Rafe

519
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,838
and I hadn't done
everything that I could,

520
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,640
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

521
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,198
Maybe you could do
a little work from home.

522
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,120
Oh, please.
I'm so ready to check out.

523
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,238
At least you won't have to
figure out where to pump.

524
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,118
Right?
Like, "Oh, excuse me, guys.

525
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,438
I'm just gonna go pump
in the broom closet real quick.

526
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,518
Pump on the toilet."

527
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,598
I'm actually gonna pump
on the subway

528
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,638
'cause it's less awkward
than at work.

529
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,720
Oh, thank you
for making me laugh.

530
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,918
Do you have your notes?

531
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,158
Yes.

532
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,798
Thank you, by the way.

533
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,518
Use them.
Don't read them.

534
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,758
Yes.
I know, I know.

535
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,918
Just get that centered.

536
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,318
Did you hear that?

537
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,320
Yeah.

538
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,440
I'm gonna take a look.

539
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,438
Nothing.

540
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,760
Oh.

541
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,478
What can you say about a man

542
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,038
who has fundamentally
changed fertility?

543
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,880
The truth is,
you can't really say enough.

544
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,758
Not in words.

545
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,038
But you can see it.

546
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,318
You can see it in the eyes
of a mother

547
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,198
looking at her newborn
for the first time,

548
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,200
seeing her purpose, her destiny.

549
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,198
You can see it in the giddiness
and that nervous energy

550
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,158
of new parents
bringing their baby home,

551
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,480
full of wonder and awe.

552
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,118
I'm filled with
an enormous warmth tonight,

553
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,478
being with John's peers,
of course,

554
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,400
and honoring him
for the fifth time in a row.

555
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,518
Dr. John Hindle.

556
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,000
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen and honored guests.

557
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,158
Basic science.

558
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,358
The fundamental foundation
of our economic, social,

559
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,518
and environmental progress
is under attack.

560
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,118
Hi, Mama.

561
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,480
Hey, Daddy.

562
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,280
I got you something.

563
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,478
Adrian.

564
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,438
We are nowhere near
being able to celebrate yet.

565
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,758
I don't want to jinx it, mister.

566
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,238
I'm celebrating...

567
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,838
because we've been through
so much already.

568
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,038
It's different this time.

569
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,398
Adrian.

570
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,918
You deserve it.

571
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,278
These are difficult times,
challenging times.

572
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,038
But there is no greater reward
than to see a young mother

573
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,798
who has toiled with
a burning desire to give life

574
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,878
and who now lies before me
with her infant on her breast,

575
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,518
spent with exhaustion
and euphoria of birth,

576
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,278
to look into that child's eyes

577
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,038
and to know that I've been part
of their existence in this life.

578
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,918
That is the true gift
of my work.

579
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,438
I'd like to put it on you.

580
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,838
Okay.

581
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,438
It is... very beautiful.

582
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,438
Honestly, thank you so much.

583
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,598
We are building a generation,

584
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,998
progressing families,

585
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,758
and giving mothers
their fairy-tale ending.

586
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,478
It's why I'm here.

587
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,038
Tonight... and always.

588
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,998
On behalf of all the families

589
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,158
whose lives I am now
forever part of...

590
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,358
I humbly accept this award.

591
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,558
<i>Does your doctor claim
to know more about your body</i>

592
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,558
<i>than you do?</i>

593
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,040
<i>That your body is high-risk?</i>

594
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,718
Hey! Whoa. Hey.

595
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,158
Relax.

596
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,358
- What are you doing?
- I th...

597
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,678
I thought I-I heard someone.

598
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,038
Oh.

599
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
It's alright.
Come here.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

600
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,278
We managed to get
a second opinion,

601
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,798
and we're feeling so much better
about Rafe and everything.

602
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,878
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

603
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,078
- That's such a relief.
- It is.

604
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,998
Oh, I'm so happy to hear that.

605
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,718
How are you?

606
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,120
I'm good.

607
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,558
I'm okay.

608
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,078
Are you?

609
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,638
I-I just...
I'm starting to feel nervous.

610
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,078
Oh.

611
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,518
A little... crazy.
I-I'm seeing things.

612
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,438
Honey, me too.

613
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,838
I'm having the wildest
mommy brain lately.

614
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,638
I don't...
I don't think it's mommy brain.

615
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,240
Something's... not right
with Wendy.

616
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,440
What do you mean?
Did Dr. Hindle say something?

617
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,918
No.
I-I-I think Dr. Hindle...

618
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,720
did something to Wendy.

619
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,278
Lucy.

620
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,278
No.
I mean, that's...

621
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,838
You're just...

622
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,278
This is a lot.

623
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,678
Have you talked to Adrian
about how you're feeling?

624
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,480
- I really think...
- No. I think Adrian's in on it.

625
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,440
In on what?

626
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,918
That's why I'm... I'm thinking
of using this midwife instead.

627
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,920
Lucy.

628
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,398
This is not like Rafe.

629
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,598
Unless something
is really wrong,

630
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,798
you should not be making
sweeping changes

631
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,800
to your birth plan.

632
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,080
Yeah.

633
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,518
Hey.

634
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,158
This pregnancy shit is no joke.

635
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,318
- Right?
- Yeah.

636
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,438
Okay, it's really scary.

637
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,040
But you are not alone.

638
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,840
Thank you, Corgan.

639
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,398
I'm gonna hop on the bike.

640
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,238
If you want to pass out
before I come back in,

641
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,998
I'll be quiet
when I come back in.

642
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,238
- Okay.
- Alright.

643
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,518
Unless you want me to stay.

644
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,598
No, no.
Enjoy.

645
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,240
Alright.

646
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,398
<i>Does your doctor claim

654
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,078
Hi.

655
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,038
I'm Grace Singleton.

656
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,638
And I believe
that women are gifted

657
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,518
with the highest-potential
purpose for humankind.

658
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,918
I became a midwife because
I wanted women to connect

659
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,238
with this planet's most powerful

660
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:17,118
and phenomenal instrument...
their bodies.

661
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:22,158
We have a spiritual current
that flows through us.

662
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,798
We are vessels
for a cosmic feat.

663
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,678
That privilege makes women the
strongest people on the earth.

664
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,438
Modern gynecology stands
on the shoulders of men

665
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,558
who thought the womb
was an unruly creature

666
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,678
inside a woman's body.

667
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,478
Doctors said labor was traumatic

668
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,758
and that we needed
to be subdued.

669
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,558
Suddenly, we can't handle
the pain as our ancestors did,

670
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,278
billions of women before us,

671
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,838
as if birth was broken

672
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,718
before these men came up
with the solutions.

673
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,398
They fear, loathe,
and covet that power,

674
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,438
and always under
the guise of concern.

675
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,518
We've been robbed
of experiencing

676
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:19,318
the richness of this process
in all its messy,

677
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,640
complex, awesome entirety.

678
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,798
Letting them make
the decisions for us...

679
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,800
That's what I call high-risk.

680
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,240
Lucy, how do you feel right now?

681
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,638
I feel like
my head is spinning.

682
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:46,158
Confront whatever it is
that's blocking you from you.

683
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,158
Let it out.

684
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,520
From your gut.

685
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,878
Go.

686
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,918
Go, Lucy.

687
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,238
Let it out.

688
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,278
Remember how
you're feeling right now.

689
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,400
Empowered.

690
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,198
Free.

691
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,360
Lucy.

692
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,280
You alright?

693
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,878
Yeah.

694
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,240
I thought I heard you scream.

695
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,638
I-I...

696
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,000
I must've been dreaming.

697
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,758
Okay.
Um...

698
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,598
Well... time to turn off
your iPad.

699
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,680
Go to bed, you millennial.

700
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,758
<i>Well, most pregnant people</i>

701
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,718
<i>have had medicalized entry
into care,</i>

702
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,440
<i>especially if you've
had IVF or IUI.</i>

703
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,638
<i>Pregnant people are not ill.</i>

704
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,318
<i>They're pregnant.</i>

705
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,038
How is that even within
the realm of possibility?

706
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,798
Thank you.

707
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,158
Well, we sent the portfolio
two... over two months ago.

708
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,198
Yes.

709
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,120
Lucy.

710
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Dawn.

711
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,918
What are you doing here?

712
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,640
I came to get the magazine.

713
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,878
With Dr. Hindle on the cover.

714
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,358
Oh.

715
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,678
Well, he's been working for...

716
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,798
oh, for 30 years
to get on that cover,

717
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,800
and he doesn't appreciate
you taking it.

718
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,558
I was only borrowing it.

719
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,678
I'll bring it back.

720
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,640
Oh.
Mommy brain.

721
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,318
Totally fine.

722
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,198
Really? You don't need
to s-see her or...

723
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,518
Nope.
Responding normally.

724
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,878
Reflexes, heartbeat.

725
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,998
You'd be surprised
at how resilient they are.

726
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,038
It was very good
that you came in, Lucy.

727
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,518
There you go.

728
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,758
I'm really sorry
about the magazine.

729
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,038
Mm.
Well, I'm sorry about Dawn.

730
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,478
She's very loyal
and proud of my work.

731
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,038
Dawn has worked for me
for the past 18 years

732
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,398
and fiercely defends her family.

733
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,558
Mm. I'm so embarrassed.

734
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,598
I really only meant
to borrow it.

735
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,798
Oh, I know that.

736
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,718
Yes, there's a lot of voodoo
out there.

737
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,480
We just want to make sure that
you get the best possible care.

738
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,920
Thank you, John,
for seeing us so last-minute.

739
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,038
Oh.

740
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,798
Thank you, buddy.

741
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,160
Yes.

742
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,840
Okay.

743
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,238
Have a good night, hon.

744
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,680
So?

745
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,280
So...

746
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,198
after talking
to Mihail and Dirk...

747
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,638
we worry about losing momentum.

748
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,160
We think Bryon should lead
on the Wyth account.

749
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,358
Really?

750
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,998
You're gonna need time.

751
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,158
It's a marathon.

752
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,398
Luce, you don't want this to be
your first one out of the gate.

753
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,758
Are you using m-my deck,
my ideas?

754
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,198
They loved you at Wyth.

755
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,318
We love you at Liegler, Lucy.

756
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,120
Come on.
Don't take this the wrong way.

757
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,720
We just want to make sure
things go smoothly.

758
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,518
I think I'm gonna need
at least a three-month buffer.

759
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,880
Yeah.
Well, she's gonna need me.

760
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,360
Huge change, yeah.

761
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,918
J... Hey, you know what?

762
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,398
Uh, c... can I call...
can I call you right back?

763
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,680
Thanks. Bye.

764
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,520
You okay?

765
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,318
No.

766
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,078
Well, what's going on?

767
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,438
They're using my deck
and my ideas.

768
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,278
I got the Wyth account, and now
I'm not allowed to work on it.

769
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,198
It's okay, it's okay.

770
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:10,358
I just had to get
out of there and come see you.

771
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,598
I got you something.

772
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,478
- Lucy...
- It's really, really good.

773
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,238
We got it at work the other day.

774
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,238
I can't believe
we haven't had it yet.

775
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,720
What the hell's going on?

776
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,238
What?

777
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,600
I can't bring my husband lunch?

778
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,358
You just brought me lunch.

779
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,038
Mommy brain
is a real thing, Lucy.

780
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:53,118
Prepartum depression hits
about one out of five women.

781
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,438
Listen to Dr. Hindle.

782
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,718
You should be enjoying
this process.

783
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,918
We now know that Xanax is safe
at .25 milligrams

784
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,600
starting the third trimester.

785
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,078
This won't affect Wendy?

786
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,238
Wendy?

787
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,800
Mm, no.
No, no.

788
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,518
Try and take care
of yourself, Lucy, hmm?

789
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,838
Can you do that for me?

790
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,478
Smile, Lucy.

791
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,998
It actually makes you happier.

792
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,720
It's scientifically proven.

793
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,080
There you go now.

794
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,398
Lucia Martin?

795
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,678
Yes.

796
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,878
Oh, my gosh.

797
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,838
I can't believe
I'm actually meeting you.

798
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:07,118
I'm a really big fan
of your words and your videos.

799
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,798
Your whole thing inspires me.

800
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,278
It is highly unusual
for me to take on a client

801
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:22,158
this late in the process.

802
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,040
But you seem vulnerable.

803
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,718
This time should feel special
and exciting,

804
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,078
not a constant uphill battle.

805
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,280
You have a lot to unpack.

806
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,240
My mom died a few years ago.

807
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,798
And I've been hoping that,
with Wendy,

808
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:54,318
I might get a piece of her back.

809
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,718
But maybe it's wrong to put
that kind of pressure on her.

810
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:02,560
See yourself with Wendy,
loving her, nurturing her.

811
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,078
Laughing with her.

812
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:12,998
Giving her all the strength you
have been given, have earned.

813
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,478
And look at her.

814
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,038
Strong little lady.

815
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,798
Hey. How you doing?

816
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,518
You're all set.
Room 1992.

817
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,838
Thank you very much.

818
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,598
- Hi.
- John.

819
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,038
Ohh.

820
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,758
<i>Room 1992.</i>

821
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,440
I found this in Adrian's safe.

822
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,678
What is this?

823
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,478
Read this.
Do you see that?

824
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,398
I-I-I'm part of a study?

825
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,078
What study?
I-I didn't sign up.

826
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,878
Do you see that?
An injection.

827
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,278
Of what?

828
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,798
Look at... Look at this.

829
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,040
Look at these photos of me.

830
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,918
I-I know they did
something to Wendy.

831
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,520
I've known it the whole time.

832
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,038
This is crazy.

833
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,318
I am not crazy.

834
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,440
They're trying to make me
think I'm crazy.

835
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,878
Can I take this
and show this to Brad?

836
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,278
Why?

837
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,558
To get a lawyer's perspective.

838
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,918
I mean, he's gonna need
to see this for himself.

839
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,758
He'll know your rights.

840
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,078
Right. Okay.

841
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,358
Thank you.

842
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,478
Just until we know
what this is,

843
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,440
you have to act like
everything is normal.

844
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,478
Hey!

845
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,758
Hey, look at me.

846
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,118
You okay?
What did you do?

847
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,360
I think I s...
I swallowed water.

848
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,920
There's no shame in it.

849
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,158
Morning.

850
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,118
What's happening?

851
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,518
I'm gonna quit.

852
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,998
Eating?

853
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,478
My job.

854
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,438
Everything.
Even Dr. Hindle.

855
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,238
You're joking.

856
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:40,118
No. I-I want to see
Grace Singleton.

857
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,918
Sorry. Who?

858
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,678
She's this midwife I found,
and I saw her yesterday,

859
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,558
and, Adrian, she was magical.

860
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:50,878
She was just... amazing.

861
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,558
She's just more natural.

862
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,158
Hindle and them, they feel so...

863
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,758
Ugh, like...

864
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,598
Yeah.

865
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,598
Look, Luce, we've been
seeing him for months.

866
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,038
I've known John for years.

867
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,238
He... He's the one
that got us pregnant.

868
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,680
He got <i>me</i> pregnant, Adrian.

869
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,078
I don't know. I'm just
more comfortable with Grace.

870
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,238
Dr. Hindle gives me
a bad feeling.

871
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,238
So you're basing this all
on a fucking feeling?

872
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,118
And what am I
supposed to tell John?

873
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,398
I don't know.

874
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,800
He's your friend.

875
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,918
No.

876
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,318
No.
No, no, no.

877
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,998
I-I-I have to draw
the line somewhere.

878
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,198
Well, not around
my birth story.

879
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,998
Your birth story?

880
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,718
So, what, you saw a post,
and now you're...

881
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,118
you're basing
our entire baby's life

882
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,200
on a fucking Instagram trend?

883
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:50,558
Let's not forget, this is my
baby we're talking about, too.

884
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,278
Um, I invited Eden and Alyson
to the shower.

885
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,678
It's gonna be really fun.

886
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,480
- Mmm.
- Oh.

887
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,678
- This is delicious.
- So that's it?

888
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,838
Yeah.

889
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,120
Do you want some?

890
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,518
Did you send the sonogram
over to Grace?

891
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,120
Yeah, I told you.

892
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,360
John is really mad
and disappointed.

893
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,198
Oh, my gosh.

894
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:30,198
- Oh! Oh, my gosh.
- Take it.

895
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,720
That is gorgeous.

896
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,678
To Lucia from me.

897
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,640
Oh, thank you.

898
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,038
What is this?

899
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:49,118
It's a first-edition copy
of <i>Peter Pan.</i>

900
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,118
It's the same one
that your mom read to you.

901
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,398
I just wanted to do a little
something besides the shower.

902
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,038
Thank you.

903
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,358
Luce?

904
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,078
Earth to Lucy!

905
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,800
How did you know
my name's Lucia?

906
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,998
What?

907
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,398
I'm sorry.

908
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,918
Is it <i>baby</i> brain
or is it <i>mommy</i> brain, right?

909
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,798
Lucy, are you okay?

910
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,200
Hey.

911
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,680
Is... Is everything alright?

912
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,240
You go to John.

913
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,598
What?

914
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,560
You go to John.

915
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:44,038
I've had three miscarriages
and tried IVF three times, Lucy.

916
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,198
I didn't have a choice.

917
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,478
When did you go?

918
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,198
We were really worried
about you,

919
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,318
and... and when I told Adrian
about my complications,

920
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,918
he got me in.

921
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,558
After everything I told you,
you went to Adrian?

922
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,358
You were scaring me.

923
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:02,118
You were obsessing, and...
and you seemed really not well.

924
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,360
I just thought that
your husband should know.

925
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,638
Wait.

926
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,438
You gave him the file.

927
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,118
That was my proof, Corgan.

928
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,998
Lucy...

929
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,918
Adrian said there is
no safe in his office.

930
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,278
Oh, my God.

931
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,440
Push!

932
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,160
Push!

933
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,158
Push!

934
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,038
Push!

935
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,640
Here she comes!

936
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,238
Here she comes, here she comes,
here she comes.

937
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,080
It's a boy.

938
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,000
It's a boy.

939
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,758
Oh. Oh.

940
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,598
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

941
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,878
Oh, my God.

942
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,078
Oh, my God.
You're crowning again.

943
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,998
Okay.

944
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,038
Oh, God.

945
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,238
Oh, God.

946
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,518
I'm having the twins!

947
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,438
You need to go to the ER
right now.

948
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,158
She's experiencing
a full placental abruption.

949
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,160
You need to go.

950
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,678
Now!

951
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,318
- You're doing great, baby.
- Doing great, Lucy.

952
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:48,438
Just push now.
Push.

953
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,838
- Push, Lucy, push.
- You're doing great.

954
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,038
It's amazing.
You're doing just amazing.

955
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,558
It's coming. It's coming.

956
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,758
The baby's head is crowning
right now.

957
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,638
Push.

958
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,078
And here he is.
Our second baby boy.

959
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,758
This is hard, and it's
difficult to understand,

960
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,558
but we will work
through this together.

961
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,678
But these are ours, and it is a
critical time to create a bond.

962
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:36,398
You know, we have
been through... a lot.

963
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,038
And...

964
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,720
this is not, um...

965
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,278
You've been through a lot,
Luce...

966
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,838
these last couple days, and...

967
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,798
It's overwhelming.

968
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,558
It's overwhelming.

969
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,878
I know it seems hard right now.

970
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,518
But this is a good thing.

971
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,920
Wait till you see
how special these boys are.

972
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,760
Such beautiful blue eyes.

973
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,118
I can't believe
this happened to me.

974
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,678
I know, I know.

975
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,240
It's crazy.

976
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,598
What happened to your office?

977
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:52,038
Wasn't it more culturally, uh...

978
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,998
Weren't there, like...

979
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,918
masks and...

980
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,160
Even your outfit
looks... different.

981
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,638
No.

982
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,320
Nothing has changed.

983
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,358
Really?

984
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,520
Mm.

985
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:18,640
I am not your mystical
Negress, Lucy.

986
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,800
I'm sorry.

987
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,880
Fuck.

988
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,158
I don't even know what to do
with myself.

989
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,320
Be better.

990
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:45,878
How?

991
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,518
I don't have the answers.

992
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,398
It's not my job.

993
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,278
It's yours.

994
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,798
I need to talk to John.

995
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,118
Do you have an appointment?

996
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,758
I need to talk to John
about reducing the wrong...

997
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,238
This way.

998
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:20,238
You have two babies
and a wonderful husband.

999
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,438
If I were you, I would go home

1000
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,198
and spend every minute
with them...

1001
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,998
mothering them.

1002
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,798
Just let Adrian and Hindle

1003
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,080
do the good work
they're trying to do.

1004
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,680
What?

1005
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,318
Oh.
He didn't tell you?

1006
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,400
Oh. I thought you two
were closer than that.

1007
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:49,560
Uh, Rita, can you bring in the
Martin-Hindle paperwork, please?

1008
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,118
Oh.

1009
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:07,760
Hm.

1010
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:11,640
Thank you.

1011
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,160
Mm-hmm.

1012
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,880
Adrian's joining the practice.

1013
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,760
Just think of all the good work
they're going to do.

1014
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,200
Welcome to the family.

1015
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,598
You poor thing.

1016
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:46,598
What Grace did,
morally reprehensible.

1017
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,838
And for her not to have
an affiliation with a hospital

1018
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,278
should be illegal.

1019
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,078
I just want Wendy.

1020
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,118
Okay?

1021
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,118
This world just breaks
my heart at times.

1022
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:02,758
I don't know what's going on
with people these days.

1023
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,278
We've got pedophiles
running the government,

1024
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,798
terrorism in our schools.

1025
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,318
Sometimes I feel like
there's no hope,

1026
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,278
no containing the onslaught.

1027
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,078
Most people don't understand
what's best for them.

1028
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:22,278
They search for solutions,
but God, money, magic...

1029
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,598
none of these things
can fix our problems.

1030
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,918
None of them cure disease.

1031
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,518
Science does.

1032
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,760
We have a saying around here.

1033
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,598
"God doesn't make babies.

1034
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,920
<i>I</i> do."

1035
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,158
Oh, my God.

1036
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,878
When you and Adrian
came in here,

1037
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,558
you said you wanted a baby.

1038
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,320
I gave you
the best genes there are.

1039
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,038
My own.

1040
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,438
You raped me.

1041
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,678
Oh, please.

1042
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,318
Lucy.

1043
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,240
There's no need for hysterics.

1044
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,558
All I wanted was a daughter.

1045
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,238
All I wanted was Wendy.

1046
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,558
Mm.

1047
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:19,238
Yes.

1048
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,398
Well, I'm sorry about the girl.

1049
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,238
But these boys...

1050
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:28,438
these boys will spread the seed.

1051
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:33,118
Now, I wish I didn't have to
do this, but it's for the best.

1052
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,078
Don't worry.

1053
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:37,278
It'll be painless.

1054
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,318
Ohh!

1055
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,718
I trained myself
not to have a gag reflex.

1056
01:22:44,519 --> 01:22:45,231
Lucy!

1057
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,360
You're gonna want to find
a new doctor.

1058
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:30,718
Wendy, I'd so like if
you'd sing me a song for sleep.

1059
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,118
Close your eyes, Michael,
