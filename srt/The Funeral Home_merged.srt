1
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,417
DO NOT ENTER AT NIGHT

2
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,542
LA FUNERARIA

3
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,472
- Oh, you're already here.
- What's up mom?

4
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,792
More things from your grandma's?

5
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm going to bring as much as I can.

6
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:47,208
Does it bother you?

7
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:48,958
How was it?

8
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,208
Fine.

9
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,625
These caskets are disgusting.

10
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:58,583
I can't stand them.

11
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:03,542
How are you?

12
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:07,708
Did you see the glue?
I can't find it anywhere.

13
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:10,750
It has to be next to the filing cabinet.

14
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,583
No, it's not there.

15
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,208
Well, I didn't touch it.

16
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Fuck! This dog shits tons.

17
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,000
And the thermos?

18
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,250
PRESS IF YOU NEED ANYTHING

19
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:27,542
Come in, please.

20
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:59,500
Take your stuff out of the bucket, Irina.

21
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,708
You can do that, give me a hand.

22
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,667
Maybe once you had thrown it out.

23
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,375
We're eating.

24
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,917
Well, that's it.

25
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,208
Do you water the violet flowers?

26
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,667
My dad's?

27
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,417
Could you leave that phone?

28
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,042
Ten minutes, Irina, while we eat.

29
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,167
Hey! Leave it.

30
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,500
You're no one to tell me what to do.

31
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,542
He's asking you right.

32
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,750
Could you put that down?

33
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,250
Grandma sent me this.

34
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,125
Take a look.

35
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:04,125
After dinner, you can look all the
pictures that your grandma sends you.

36
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,333
I forgot to give them the cups.

37
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,542
My grandma is going to buy me
a new cellphone.

38
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,583
If you get bad notes,
there won't be a new cellphone.

39
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,000
My grandma said so, and she pays for it.

40
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,500
Fine, then you tell her.

41
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:33,542
I wouldn't have a thing
without my grandma.

42
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,625
Don't lie.

43
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,250
She said you should at least
use the pension money of my dad

44
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:43,750
to buy me new ballet shoes,

45
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,708
or pay for my dance classes.

46
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,417
You tell her to stop making up stories.

47
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:52,500
If she wants to give you photos,
pictures, posters of your dad, she can.

48
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,417
But that shitty old woman
must stop messing with me.

49
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:12,125
SEE YOU AT THE BICYCLE

50
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,042
I buy you the ballet shoes,

51
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,875
but you decided
to stop attending dance classes.

52
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,958
- You made me lose interest.
- Who made you lose interest in classes?

53
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:29,958
Who did it?!

54
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,792
Not even once you went to see me.

55
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,792
I couldn't go!

56
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:39,333
I had shitty moments,

57
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,875
...fucked up moments.
You know it really well.

58
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,208
Now that I'm better, that I feel calmer,

59
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,208
you don't want to go again.

60
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:50,958
I don't feel like going anymore.

61
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,417
And those awards you've won,

62
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,458
I would have loved to have seen you,

63
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,750
to be there with you.

64
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:02,792
Oh my child, you're unfair.

65
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,125
You billed me for everything.

66
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,208
Your dad didn't go to see you either!

67
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,500
Only my grandma was there.

68
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,125
I have to give them this.

69
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,875
I WANT TO SEE YOU

70
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,667
They want tea. Is there any?

71
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,250
There's mate tea bags. Here.

72
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,042
Emma?

73
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,417
Dad?

74
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,667
That perfume is never going away.

75
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,375
The truth is that in the last
times I was afraid of your dad.

76
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,167
He had his forgetfulness.
Maybe fear of that,

77
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:03,583
But being afraid of him,
seems too much to me.

78
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:05,625
Yes, but it's not his forgetfulness,

79
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:09,875
I mean the weird and dark stuff
in which he was involved.

80
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,167
He is dead now, leave it.

81
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,917
We shouldn't have hold here
the wake for him.

82
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,708
He was my dad.

83
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,208
Where should I hold his wake
if I own a funeral home?

84
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,375
We own.

85
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:25,750
I don't want to talk about it.

86
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,458
Did you talk to Irina?

87
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,542
No, I didn't.

88
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,583
She wants to move with her grandma.

89
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,042
You know that old woman is a manipulator.

90
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,917
I remember her putting ice
on my swollen eye,

91
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,708
while saying good things about her son.

92
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,250
She is awful.

93
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,208
What happened yesterday?

94
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,667
They got into the room.

95
00:20:58,542 --> 00:20:59,583
No way.

96
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,000
I saw them!

97
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,857
It pulled Emma out of the fish tank,

98
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,280
I don't want to be here anymore.

99
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:06,708
Ramona did all to keep them out
of the bedrooms.

100
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:07,768
Well, it didn't work.

101
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:09,432
I want to get the fuck out of this house!

102
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,583
Something got in.

103
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,542
I'm going to bring Ramona again.

104
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,167
Anyway, she said they can't do
anything to us.

105
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:24,542
Take them out!

106
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,625
How long do these things live?

107
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,083
I have no idea.

108
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,125
We should have taken
all those critters out.

109
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,625
Do they bother you that much?

110
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,922
Yes. Your old man should
have beheaded them all.

111
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,083
They're horrible.

112
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,417
They are so annoying!

113
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,917
I told them we were leaving at nine.

114
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,917
What cemetery are you taking her to?

115
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,292
To the Peace Garden of Virrey del Pino.

116
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,917
They are very tricky with the documents.

117
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,958
I still want to come back early
to take a nap.

118
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,667
But I'm sure this will take long.

119
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:57,958
So, are you coming late again?

120
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,500
Will you go to the cemetery
or somewhere else?

121
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,292
The same again?

122
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,125
I go to the cemetery and I'll
take the time that I have to.

123
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,125
Yes, but we don't even sleep together.

124
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,500
We don't talk, is it forbidden
to be in bed with me?

125
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,125
I'm in bed with you,

126
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,125
you don't even notice it
because you are always on pills.

127
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,917
Bernardo,

128
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,583
I'm not going to let aside
what Irina said.

129
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,417
Give me the number and I call her.

130
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,750
No, I'll call her.

131
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'll tell her to come,
but she isn't always available for me.

132
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:35,458
Mom,

133
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:38,458
he doesn't care,
won't tell her anything. You'll see.

134
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,458
He's not mean to you.

135
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,708
I didn't say he's a bad guy.

136
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:45,833
I know he isn't your dad,
but respect him.

137
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,125
It makes me good to be with him.

138
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,917
I finally found a person
who respects me, sweetie.

139
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,000
You don't want to be alone,

140
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:55,458
that's the matter.

141
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,500
I didn't say he's a bad guy,

142
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:00,583
but I want to get the fuck out
of this house full of things.

143
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,000
It's this or the street.

144
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,333
We have nowhere else to go.

145
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,250
I do, I have my grandma's house.

146
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,542
Do you think I'm not scared?

147
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,333
I'm scared too.

148
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:16,250
But let's think about what Ramona said,

149
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:21,184
How can we not have presences,
if we have a funeral home in the house?

150
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,833
We must be alert, that's all.

151
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:26,042
And like Bernardo says, right?

152
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:29,583
Spirits don't kill,

153
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,500
people hit, kill, there are thieves,

154
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:36,042
I'm more afraid if you go out there,
than if you're in here, sweetie.

155
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,542
Do you know why I stay here?

156
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,833
Because of what the shaman
said about my dad.

157
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,167
Yes,

158
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:48,042
your dad must be among all the presences.

159
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,542
I want to see him at least once,

160
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,000
then I'll go to my grandma's
and you don't see me anymore.

161
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:34,042
Irina.

162
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:35,917
Can we talk for a minute?

163
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,485
Would you like something to drink?

164
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:40,542
No.

165
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:45,125
Look, I don't want to take
your father's place,

166
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:48,542
but you can't be so defensive
with me all the time.

167
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:52,042
It's just that you are always
giving me orders,

168
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,875
give orders to mom, but not to me.

169
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,500
You can't do whatever you want.

170
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:58,333
You must follow some rules, that's all.

171
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,000
And I don't follow the rules?

172
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,375
I piss in the bucket,

173
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:04,583
I freaking freeze at night for using
the portable toilet for customers.

174
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:08,000
Your mom and I use that toilet too,
because Ramona said so.

175
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,375
Besides, I'm talking about rules
of living together.

176
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:15,750
Any day cleaning the house,
wipe the floor, sweep, those things.

177
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,542
I just tell you to do those things.

178
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:20,375
I'm not one of the presences,
I'm…

179
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:22,417
I'm flesh and blood.

180
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,125
And I understand everything,
but you're a big girl,

181
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:27,625
and you have to understand, too.

182
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,750
I know of your pain because of the
motocycle's accident of your father,

183
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:32,167
you've lost him.

184
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,708
But your dad wasn't good with your mom.

185
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:40,417
He was obsessively jealous.

186
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,667
A motherfucker
who beat her up continuously,

187
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,083
and you know it.

188
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:48,083
Wash your mouth before
talking like that about my dad.

189
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:50,583
Kick me out!

190
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,333
You're used to throw people
out of this house, anyway.

191
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:57,250
All towels are wet, no dry ones, sweetie.

192
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,125
Is something wrong?

193
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,458
This mark is very rare.

194
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,792
Wouldn't Irina's father
be here too? Would he?

195
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,250
Don't be a fool.

196
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:12,667
You know that's a lie of yours.

197
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,833
I'm serious.

198
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,875
SHE WILL LOVE IT

199
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,542
It's for you.

200
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:22,167
THANKS DAD

201
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:28,917
I like it when you call me like that.

202
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,083
I love you so much.

203
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:39,833
You're like the daughter I never had.

204
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:19,125
Go to play.

205
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,625
Go to play that I have to talk.

206
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,458
Show yourself.

207
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,458
I want to see what you look like.

208
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,500
This is not enough for me anymore.

209
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:09,917
Take care of me, dad.

210
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,542
Mom, is that you?

211
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:24,125
Bernardo?

212
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

213
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:25,792
Mom! Mom!

214
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:27,208
Mom!

215
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:30,750
Mom, wake up. Wake up! Mom!

216
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:34,333
Mom! Wake up! Wake up!

217
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,042
Get away!

218
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:40,125
Get away, please!

219
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,792
Get away.

220
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:48,875
Irina. What happened?
What happened Irina?

221
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:52,458
- What happened?
- This is all your fault!

222
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,667
- I want to leave!
- No, no, no.

223
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:00,250
No, no, calm down.

224
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,417
Take me to my grandma's.

225
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,667
Please, I can't stand this anymore.

226
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,750
Take me to my grandma's!

227
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,333
I'm going to my grandma's.

228
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,042
You go tomorrow, sweetie.
I promise.

229
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:30,167
I'm not staying here anymore.

230
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,333
But it's too late
to go to your grandma's,

231
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,208
You go tomorrow.

232
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,167
Today I stay here with you.

233
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:31,750
DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING LIKE AN
IDIOT

234
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,917
I had to go.

235
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,167
Come on, come here.

236
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,583
Come.

237
00:35:56,417 --> 00:35:58,292
DICKHEAD

238
00:35:58,583 --> 00:35:59,708
Enough.

239
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,333
Stop.

240
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:14,417
What's wrong with that fucking dog?

241
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,500
Don't mess with that!

242
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,250
Did you hear me?

243
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,833
HELP ME. IT WASN'T ME.

244
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Sweetie.

245
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,792
Would you leave me one?

246
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:11,458
This one.

247
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:18,833
Thank you.

248
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,708
Today is the first time that
I don't feel his perfume.

249
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:10,833
I can see you don't feel like talking.

250
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,833
I'm a little tired.

251
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:16,458
Tired.

252
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:22,083
Yes, a little from everything.

253
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:30,500
I miss Irina.

254
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:33,125
I miss her too, actually.

255
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,583
Specially her cellphone's
keyboard clicking.

256
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,750
Is her what I miss.

257
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,500
I also miss her.

258
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:47,292
Don't start an argument with me.

259
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,542
May I ask you something?

260
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:06,167
You are mad because
I got my tubes tied, right?

261
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:10,000
Well, that's...

262
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:14,292
a decision you made at that moment,

263
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,708
it's very personal.

264
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:21,000
I think you were too young.

265
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,083
Yes.

266
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,250
I'd had two miscarriages as well.

267
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,483
And if it was up to Irina's father,

268
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:33,023
he would have got me pregnant
once a year, just to control me.

269
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,083
That's why I had the surgery.

270
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:45,833
I would have loved to give you a child.

271
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:50,208
I already got used to the idea
that it will be so.

272
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:57,167
In life, sometimes those things happen,
sometimes don't...

273
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:02,375
...it didn't happened to me,
and I accept it.

274
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,167
On top, all women you were with,
left you...

275
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,625
...because of your dad,

276
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:09,917
and that unhealthy relationship
you had with him.

277
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,833
I didn't have an unhealthy
relationship with my dad.

278
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:17,000
He's gone, Estela, stop digging in there.

279
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:22,042
Besides, not all women broke up with me,

280
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,708
in some relationships I cut.

281
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:26,292
Well,

282
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:27,792
cut them all,

283
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:31,000
because it looks like some
of them haven't heard yet.

284
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,625
What are you talking about?

285
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:34,125
It's nothing.

286
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,625
Come here.

287
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,708
Where are you?

288
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:02,542
Please, show up.

289
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:07,708
Don't be mad.

290
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:12,625
I can't stop talking to her,
she's my wife.

291
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:16,583
Where are you?

292
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:23,875
Just come, please.

293
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:29,250
Come here a little while.

294
00:44:31,042 --> 00:44:32,833
Please.

295
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,458
CERTIFICATE OF DEATH

296
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:28,875
Carmen, come.

297
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
I know.

298
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:34,583
You're Carmen.

299
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:36,917
Melina.

300
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,500
Come here.

301
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:42,167
Carmen,

302
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:45,333
just a minute.

303
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,542
Melina!

304
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:57,000
Carmen!

305
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:09,708
Melina.

306
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:11,667
Melina!

307
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:34,458
Bernardo?

308
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:36,833
What's that?

309
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Bernardo?

310
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:45,667
Bernardo!

311
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:48,000
Bernardo!

312
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:52,500
Bernardo!

313
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:55,667
Bernardo!

314
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,292
Bernardo!

315
00:49:00,042 --> 00:49:01,875
No! No!

316
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,833
Help! Help!

317
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,167
Bernardo!

318
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:10,250
Bernardo! Bernardo!

319
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:12,500
No! No!

320
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:13,917
Help!

321
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:16,542
Bernardo!

322
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:37,375
Bernardo!

323
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:39,333
Bernardo!

324
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:40,958
Bernardo, come out!

325
00:49:41,417 --> 00:49:42,708
Bernardo, come out!

326
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:37,708
And?

327
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:42,042
Wait, give her some time.

328
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:34,792
I feel something,

329
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,667
I need you to wait outside the house.

330
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:42,000
I'm going to perform a ritual
that will help me see some things,

331
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:45,792
please don't talk to me.

332
00:54:07,292 --> 00:54:08,292
Bernardo!

333
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:11,292
Bernardo!

334
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,250
Look!

335
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:16,167
He left them open again.

336
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:25,042
I stand that he mistreats us,
but this is dangerous.

337
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,125
I've been telling you,
your dad's getting worse,

338
00:54:29,792 --> 00:54:31,083
I wanted you to see it.

339
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:35,458
If I didn't realize this I'd turn on
the light, and we'd all blow up.

340
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:39,917
He's stingy with the food for Irina,
and treats me like a cleaning lady,

341
00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:43,333
I'm not letting this go,
I'm leaving with my daughter now!

342
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,708
Estela,

343
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:46,167
Estela I'm going to talk.

344
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:18,583
Today we could all have blown up to shit,

345
00:55:19,292 --> 00:55:21,208
and this one is like the tenth time.

346
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,375
This is dangerous, Dad,
you can't live here anymore.

347
00:55:28,042 --> 00:55:30,042
You're dumb, son,

348
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:33,750
and always so henpecked.

349
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:38,875
You've been against her, and Irina
because she's someone else's daughter.

350
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:44,083
You treat them like shit,
don't talk to them, and hide the food.

351
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:50,250
Irina isn't my granddaughter,
and she is an opportunistic.

352
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:52,917
I'm not discussing that with you anymore.

353
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:57,875
When it's not the heater, is the
gas stove; Dish soap instead of juice.

354
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:03,083
We can't take care of you,

355
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:08,083
you need someone to do it,

356
00:56:10,708 --> 00:56:13,375
Someone recommended a place to
me…

357
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:18,625
It's an expensive one,
you're going to be fine there.

358
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:24,417
All right, son,

359
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,958
but I want you to know that you're wrong.

360
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:38,083
May I ask you a favor?

361
00:56:41,875 --> 00:56:44,000
Wait till tomorrow, then I'll leave.

362
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:47,917
Fine.

363
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:04,583
Fuck, there were those pictures.

364
01:00:06,417 --> 01:00:08,833
We have time to talk
without it hearing us.

365
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:14,708
How did your dad die?

366
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,833
I'm sorry to be so direct,

367
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,542
I need to know well, to understand
some things that are going on.

368
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:29,000
He died of cold
lying on the bench of a park.

369
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,417
He was a very proud man,

370
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,583
he escaped from the home we paid for him,
I don't know why,

371
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:42,667
- when he was okay there.
- There's no time for that now.

372
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:45,500
I'm putting together the puzzle
you have here.

373
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:49,333
That time when I came,

374
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:54,000
you had only a couple of spirits
in the house by then.

375
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:57,750
I gave them their place on
the field and part of the house,

376
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:01,292
I negotiated with the presences
or there was going to get violent.

377
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:04,542
There was a presence that tricked me,

378
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,625
it blended in with the others,

379
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:13,750
I thought it was elusive and lonely,
but it was much more than that.

380
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:16,458
It's a demon.

381
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:19,208
And my only preventive measure was

382
01:01:19,417 --> 01:01:21,500
telling you not to use
the bathroom at night.

383
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:29,000
Your dad was hurt for being kicked out,

384
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:32,792
and left them this gift,
so it kills Irina and your wife.

385
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:38,333
My dad was a fucked-up man,

386
01:01:39,667 --> 01:01:42,458
and he was into weird and dark things,

387
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:45,257
but not to the point
of wanting to kill them...

388
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,250
I'd have never expected this
from Salvador,

389
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:55,583
he found in this demon a way
to accomplish what he couldn't,

390
01:01:55,792 --> 01:01:58,792
in return,
he promised to let it exist on this plane.

391
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,625
Wicked bastard.

392
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:05,167
He made a pact with the demon
to kill Irina and your wife.

393
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:08,917
I'm fucking leaving,
I'm fucking going out of here!

394
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,375
Believe me that you need to stay,

395
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:13,083
here I have it under control,

396
01:02:13,292 --> 01:02:14,332
I saw this demon up close,

397
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:19,208
it is bloodthirsty, cynical,
and plays with the victims.

398
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:25,083
Your dad realized he was going
to kill everyone, you too Bernardo,

399
01:02:25,292 --> 01:02:26,458
then he backed out,

400
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:30,125
and started dragging spirits
from the funeral home to stop him,

401
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:31,625
but it was too late.

402
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,292
He was the only one
who could hold this entity.

403
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:39,023
Is there anything left in the house?

404
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:42,250
There's something with low energy.

405
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:44,500
Who could it be?

406
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:46,083
It doesn't matter.

407
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:58,750
Each tip represents a moon.

408
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:02,958
The demon gathered the necessary
forces to carry out this massacre,

409
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,625
tonight is its last chance.

410
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:08,750
Your dad was expelled at
the right time from this house.

411
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:14,333
You have to bring Irina, now.

412
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,300
You are crazy! No way
I'm bringing Irina here!

413
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,292
It's going to try to kill her anyway!

414
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:21,292
If she is here with me,
nothing's going to happen to her.

415
01:03:21,958 --> 01:03:23,833
Do as I say, now!

416
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:25,583
Is she far away?

417
01:03:25,792 --> 01:03:27,125
Yes, she is far.

418
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:28,333
Bring her now.

419
01:03:29,167 --> 01:03:30,167
I'm going to bring her.

420
01:03:59,167 --> 01:04:00,708
Stay calm, sweetie.

421
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:11,875
GRANDMA COME HERE AND GET ME.

422
01:04:12,042 --> 01:04:13,542
You have to drink this.

423
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,958
With this inside the body,

424
01:04:16,542 --> 01:04:19,083
It can't possess anyone in the house.

425
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,958
The pact expires at dawn,

426
01:04:27,542 --> 01:04:29,250
we have to resist the whole night.

427
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,792
No way, I'm not going to drink that.

428
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,167
I beg you, please sweetie, drink it.

429
01:04:35,917 --> 01:04:37,583
You're all out of your minds.

430
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:39,583
Listen to me at least once,

431
01:04:39,958 --> 01:04:41,792
I'm asking you as a mother, drink it.

432
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:46,833
Trust me, Irina, I want to help you.

433
01:04:49,042 --> 01:04:50,458
I want to help you.

434
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,125
Quick.

435
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:15,792
Stay inside the circle.

436
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:17,292
I can't confront it,

437
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,458
all we can do is resist.

438
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,625
Don't get tempted by anything.

439
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:30,333
It's been a long while,
but we still have a lot ahead.

440
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:44,042
It can't find the way.

441
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:51,875
It can't find a way to kill you.

442
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:06,208
Irina?

443
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:08,917
Where's Irina?

444
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:11,542
Come down, baby!

445
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:14,375
It can't possess her, just scare her.

446
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:16,375
You don't leave the circle.

447
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:18,042
Listen to her.

448
01:07:19,917 --> 01:07:21,292
Wait there baby!

449
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,250
This is weird.

450
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:31,833
I feel like the demon
already left the house.

451
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:39,917
The buzzer from the funeral home.

452
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:55,958
Someone is here.

453
01:08:01,167 --> 01:08:02,583
Is that Irina's grandma?

454
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,875
That's not Irina's grandma anymore.

455
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:07,792
Yes, she is.

456
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:13,208
It's not her,

457
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:16,958
now that's the demon.

458
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:31,083
Get out of the circle!
It's pointless now!

459
01:08:31,292 --> 01:08:32,625
Lock the windows!

460
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:56,125
No!

461
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:33,375
Fuck off motherfucker!

462
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:37,125
Don't get out baby!

463
01:09:37,583 --> 01:09:38,583
Don't get out!

464
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:41,625
Bernardo!

465
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:45,333
No!

466
01:09:45,542 --> 01:09:47,542
No! No!

467
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:49,458
Don't get out baby!

468
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:52,458
No!

469
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:55,042
No! No!

470
01:09:59,042 --> 01:10:00,042
No!

471
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,625
Ramona!

472
01:11:38,792 --> 01:11:40,500
Ramona help me, please!

473
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:42,625
Help me!

474
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:46,000
Irina.

475
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:49,667
Don't get close to your grandma,
she's the demon!

476
01:11:51,917 --> 01:11:53,542
I don't understand.

477
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:28,583
Mom.

478
01:12:32,375 --> 01:12:33,375
Mom.

479
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:34,875
Mom?

480
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:38,958
Mom, where are you?

481
01:14:08,667 --> 01:14:10,417
No, Orco.

482
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

483
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:13,333
No, mom, please.

484
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:20,833
Don't leave me alone, please.

485
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:58,792
No!

486
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:00,375
No!

487
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:02,583
Get out of this house, Irina!

488
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:34,000
It closed the place, hide.

489
01:16:34,208 --> 01:16:35,208
Hide!

490
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:44,083
No! Stop! Leave me!
I did nothing!

491
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,208
Leave her alone...

492
01:17:13,167 --> 01:17:17,458
The pact has ended.

493
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:25,875
Leave that body.

494
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:37,000
No. No!

495
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:45,583
Irina,

496
01:17:48,542 --> 01:17:51,625
I couldn't do anything,

497
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:55,500
it killed your grandma.

498
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,500
I could,

499
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:01,333
see...

500
01:18:01,667 --> 01:18:04,167
in your eyes,

501
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:07,750
all your pain.

502
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:12,792
I can't breath.

503
01:18:15,583 --> 01:18:21,167
I leave you a special gift,

504
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:26,500
it won't last long.

505
01:21:48,042 --> 01:21:49,500
I love you sweetie.

506
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:52,583
You did great! You are great!

507
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:56,292
I love you.

508
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:05,125
Mom.

509
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:09,083
Mom.

510
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:11,500
Mom.

511
01:22:12,292 --> 01:22:13,292
Mom.

512
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:17,125
Mom!

513
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:19,149
