1
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,105
Listen to me.

2
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,066
OK, you win.

3
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:53,154
At least you could stop that song.
You know l hate it.

4
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,866
Why are you so quiet?

5
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,831
Say something!

6
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,203
You're there.

7
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,080
And you're looking at me.

8
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,458
Do you think you can fool me?

9
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,753
No, no, you can't fool me,

10
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,714
because l can feel your presence.

11
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,842
And your movements.

12
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,095
l can even smell you.

13
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,138
lf you think...

14
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,724
lf you think, son of a bitch,

15
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,519
that l'll hang myself
while you watch, you...

16
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,544
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

17
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,838
Julia, what's wrong?

18
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,091
Julia, can you hear me?
Bring some water.

19
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,968
Take it easy, Julia.

20
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,887
Julia, are you OK?

21
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,389
- What happened?
- She fell.

22
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,726
- Oall a doctor, quick!
- No, l'm OK.

23
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,061
l'm OK.

24
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,070
This is Sara. I can't take your caII
at the moment. PIease...

25
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,993
Do you think it's a good idea
to show up after six months?

26
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,579
l just need to know
that she is all right.

27
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,124
Sara?

28
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,211
Sara?

29
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,591
Maybe they have gone out.

30
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,009
No...

31
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,428
l know something's happened to her.

32
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,191
The power is out.

33
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,405
- The fuses seem to be OK.
- l'll look upstairs.

34
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:28,661
Sara?

35
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,005
Sara?

36
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,782
lsaac, she's nowhere to be found.
We'll ask the neighbours.

37
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,326
- Don't come down.
- Why?

38
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,956
What's wrong?

39
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,628
lsaac, tell me what's wrong.

40
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,756
- What's wrong?
- Julia...

41
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,259
- What's wrong?
- Oome with me.

42
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,231
lnspector...

43
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,859
l'm sorry about what happened.

44
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,819
No, thanks.

45
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:47,574
The forensics say Sara took her own life
last night, during the blackout.

46
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,868
But we need to find out why.

47
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,455
l have been informed that she suffered
a degenerative disease.

48
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:58,335
Yes, a progressive vision loss,
the same as my wife.

49
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,838
But Sara went blind a year ago.

50
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,132
And how did she cope with that?

51
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,345
My sister wasn't depressed,
if that's what you mean.

52
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,638
ln fact, she was...

53
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,516
She was going to have surgery, right?

54
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:17,812
She was waiting for a donor,
but she hoped to get her vision back.

55
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,447
Maybe she got tired of waiting.

56
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,897
All right.

57
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,527
Yes, thank you.

58
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:13,201
Dr Roman can't come to the funeral,
and he sends his condolences.

59
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,038
He also wants to check your eyes
before you go back home.

60
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,250
lsaac, the power is back.

61
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,796
Darling, are you listening?

62
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,882
And the OD started playing.
Did you hear it?

63
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,053
- Yes.
- Don't you think it's strange

64
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,306
that Sara was listening
to music before...?

65
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,767
Besides, she hated that song.

66
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,437
- Julia...
- What if she wasn't alone?

67
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,356
- What if she was with somebody?
- Julia, please.

68
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:47,736
We may never find out her reasons.
We hadn't heard from her in months.

69
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,447
lt's strange.
l need to know what happened.

70
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,117
- lt's not good for you to get upset.
- l'm not worried about myself.

71
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:58,663
Well, l am.
Stress can turn you blind.

72
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,666
lt's only happened to me
twice in five years.

73
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,669
And you've lost 20% of your vision.

74
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,182
Oh, no... Again.

75
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,325
Did you find anything?

76
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,286
Nothing, not even a candle.

77
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,374
- lt's time to meet the neighbours.
- OK, hurry up.

78
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,899
lsaac?

79
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,298
Julia.

80
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,167
Excuse me.

81
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,462
Excuse me.

82
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:18,678
l'm sorry for your loss.
l'm Blasco, her next-door neighbour.

83
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,639
l didn't know your sister very well,

84
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:26,853
but Lia loved her very much
and she wanted me to bring you this.

85
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,730
Lia?

86
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,901
My daughter.
Sara used to lend her books.

87
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:38,198
The poor girl is so upset she didn't
want to come out of the car.

88
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,326
Anyway...

89
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:46,998
Sorry... Lia would like to know
if Sara left any note.

90
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,045
- We don't know.
- l understand.

91
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,840
Anyway, l won't bother you any longer.

92
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,765
Shall we continue?

93
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,267
Only a neighbour and his daughter?

94
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,189
l didn't know she was so lonely.

95
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,536
But l forgave her.

96
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,208
And l also forgave you.

97
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,925
Now l only need to forgive myself
for not being by her side.

98
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,187
But l did everything l could,
didn't l, lsaac?

99
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,373
The autopsy doesn't reveal
anything strange.

100
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:15,211
- Have you searched for fingerprints?
- We only found ours and hers.

101
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,255
OK, but...

102
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,382
That song...

103
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,885
And what about what happened
in the cemetery?

104
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:26,890
Julia, there's no evidence
of anyone being with your sister.

105
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,435
And nobody has seen or heard
anything suspicious.

106
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:35,774
You can speak with Soledad if you wish.

107
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,027
- With whom?
- An old lady who lives nearby.

108
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:43,365
Apparently, she helped your sister
when she went blind.

109
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,992
Don't be long.

110
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,667
Where does she live?

111
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,878
Follow the rope in the yard.

112
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,338
What rope?

113
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,977
l'm sure the old woman
doesn't know anything.

114
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,314
Nobody else knew apart from you.

115
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:21,277
But you have to speak with your wife.
She'll find out sooner or later.

116
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,948
l'll wait for the right moment.

117
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,312
Mrs Soledad?

118
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,529
Hello?

119
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,242
Who is it?

120
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,327
lt's Julia, Sara's sister.

121
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,163
l'll be right out.

122
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:22,964
Sorry about the mess.
The house must be quite disgusting.

123
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,594
Hello...

124
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:32,849
- Are you there?
- Yes. Sorry, l didn't know you were...

125
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:37,937
l am sorry too. l wanted to come
to your sister's funeral, but...

126
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,191
it took me an hour to find
a pair of matching shoes.

127
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,859
lt's OK.

128
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,862
Were you a good friend of Sara?

129
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,866
Well, when she started
losing her eyesight,

130
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:54,871
a year ago,
we used to have long conversations.

131
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,460
But lately she hardly spoke with me.

132
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,962
She had made new friends.

133
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:07,509
- What new friends?
- You know, younger people.

134
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:11,930
- From the Baumann Oentre.
- Baumann Oentre. What's that?

135
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,766
A centre for blind people,
not far from here.

136
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:21,147
One of those places where they make you
believe you can live a normal life.

137
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:25,985
lf you can't hear, you are deaf.
lf you lost an arm, you are a cripple.

138
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,905
And if you can't see, you are blind.

139
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,991
And nothing can ever be
how it used to be.

140
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,329
Mrs Soledad, where can l take a taxi?

141
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,123
Thank you.

142
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:46,464
Go straight ahead,
down the stairs and turn right.

143
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,779
Poor Sara.

144
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:13,283
- Why would she hang herself?
- Stop thinking about it.

145
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,202
- Shall we have a moment of silence?
- Don't be cruel.

146
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:19,080
None of us could stand her.

147
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,791
Don't you find it strange?

148
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,376
No.

149
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,587
We've all thought
of doing it at some time.

150
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,715
Dela...

151
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,344
Nora is right. l once thought
of slitting my wrists.

152
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,889
With candles and opera music.

153
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,641
Me too, l thought ofjumping
out of the window.

154
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,895
Well, we thought about it
but didn't do it.

155
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,065
There's a reason to live.

156
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,984
Maybe Sara didn't find any.

157
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:52,614
And a boyfriend doesn't seem like
a good reason?

158
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,991
Sara had a boyfriend?

159
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,118
She told me she met a boy.

160
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,287
- Who?
- No idea.

161
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,041
They had been going out together
for a couple of months.

162
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,461
They even went to Bellavista
together for a week.

163
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,675
- What's in Bellavista?
- Rooms for sex.

164
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,387
Quiet!

165
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,606
How weird! Shit!

166
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,441
What is it?

167
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,111
There's someone here.

168
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,906
- l would say it's Sara.
- That's not funny!

169
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:39,619
- l can smell her too.
- Something is moving.

170
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:44,207
- l've got her! Oall security!
- l'm Sara's sister.

171
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,959
Julia?

172
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:47,961
Yes.

173
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:52,173
- Why were you spying on us?
- l just didn't want to interrupt.

174
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,218
- And who is he?
- Who?

175
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,595
- The man who came with you.
- l came alone.

176
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
There's someone else here.
A man, and he's right behind you.

177
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,331
Wait!

178
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

179
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,006
Who are you?

180
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:58,800
Turn around.

181
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,678
Turn around.

182
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,430
l said turn around!

183
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,344
No, no!

184
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,699
lsaac?

185
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,540
lsaac?

186
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,643
Hotel Romeo, Bellavista.

187
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,855
What happened to you?

188
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,441
You are soaking wet.

189
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,444
lt started raining
when l left Soledad's house.

190
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,614
Have you been with her all this time?

191
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:49,160
She invited me for tea.
l couldn't say no.

192
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:54,541
Julia, l went to look for you.
You left her place an hour ago.

193
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,210
Where have you been?

194
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,546
Why are you so controlling?

195
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:02,424
l could also ask you
what you're looking for.

196
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,220
Fine.

197
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,098
Fine.

198
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:13,893
Now l'm certain there was
something strange in Sara's suicide.

199
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:18,773
- There's someone watching us.
- Julia, Julia, please.

200
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,150
Who?

201
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,321
Her boyfriend.

202
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,574
- Sara had a boyfriend?
- Yes.

203
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:28,742
Who told you?

204
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,327
A group of blind girls told me
at the Baumann Oentre

205
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,204
and someone was spying on us.

206
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,999
- How do you know?
- Because l ran after him.

207
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:39,210
- You ran after him?
- Yes, l did.

208
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,004
lsaac.

209
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:45,133
- lsaac! What are you doing?
- We're leaving this house.

210
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,803
Listen to me. lf l have to be
a controlling husband, l will be.

211
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,181
And if l have to drag you out of here,
l will too.

212
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:54,184
But l won't let you have a seizure.

213
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:57,187
You know l would never
forgive myself.

214
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,315
Your sister's death has hurt us enough.

215
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,158
You're right.

216
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,745
But l don't feel like
going back home.

217
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,124
Why don't we go somewhere,
you and me, alone?

218
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:30,845
Where would you like to go?

219
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:59,708
- Are you sure you want to stay there?
- The guide says it's the cosiest hotel.

220
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,885
Nice view, isn't it?

221
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:15,515
- Julia.
- Yes, yes. lt's beautiful.

222
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,100
Thank you.

223
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,644
Julia...

224
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:22,981
- l'll park the car.
- Yes, OK.

225
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:29,237
You don't remember my sister,
a blind woman?

226
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:32,032
Yes, a colleague talked to me about her.

227
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,825
This may sound weird,

228
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:37,162
but could you find out
the name of the man who was with her?

229
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:42,083
- There's no name on the receipt.
- Sorry, but l don't remember any man.

230
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,376
The thing is...

231
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,504
my sister is dead,
and l need to find this man.

232
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,632
Let me see... l don't understand.

233
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,344
Her booking is not registered.

234
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:56,014
lt's as if all the information
was deleted.

235
00:25:56,222 --> 00:26:00,685
- Are you sure?
- Sorry. lt must be a computer problem.

236
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:06,358
You could try El Arlequin. lt's the
restaurant we recommend to our guests.

237
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:07,984
Thank you.

238
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:09,235
Thank you.

239
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:17,786
Thank you.

240
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:21,373
l don't understand how they can
recommend this restaurant.

241
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,458
l like it.

242
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,546
lt's not your style at all.

243
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:35,637
And that waiter
won't stop staring at you.

244
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:37,514
Really?

245
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,356
- lt's your imagination.
- Maybe.

246
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:54,698
- My reading glasses...
- ln your coat? How weird.

247
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,369
l'll go and get them,
and l'll go to the toilet too.

248
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:04,082
lf he hits on you, just yell.

249
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:16,845
What a change!

250
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,017
l like it. lt highlights your eyes.
By the way, l knew they were green.

251
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:26,521
You're confusing me with my twin sister.
She was here last week.

252
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,690
With her boyfriend.

253
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,275
Her boyfriend?

254
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,777
She came with a man, didn't she?

255
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:35,864
Yes, l think so.

256
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:40,160
- Do you remember his name?
- No, no idea.

257
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:43,204
He was very quiet, very sad.

258
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:47,584
- Oould you describe him?
- Sure, he was...

259
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:51,296
He was very plain,
like any other man.

260
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:54,632
But was he tall, short,
blond hair, dark hair?

261
00:27:58,136 --> 00:27:59,888
l can't remember right now.

262
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,932
How can you remember my sister
but nothing about the man?

263
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:07,270
She drew a bit of attention
with that blindfold.

264
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:10,523
Blindfold?

265
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:13,818
She was bandaged after the operation.

266
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:20,492
- Did she have an operation?
- Of course.

267
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,702
Hence the bet over her eye colour.

268
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,996
She said she'd come
once she'd recovered,

269
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:27,332
and if l guessed her eye colour,
l could...

270
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:30,210
- Pablo, can you come for a second?
- Yes, sure.

271
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,671
Excuse me.
My greetings to her.

272
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,138
l couldn't find them.

273
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,393
Let's see how l manage.

274
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:54,025
ls something wrong?

275
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,117
Sara was here last week.

276
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:09,207
Julia... what are we doing here?

277
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:13,753
lsaac, the waiter told me
she had her eyes bandaged.

278
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:15,171
Do you realise?

279
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:20,593
lf she had the operation and had
a chance to regain her sight,

280
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:23,805
why would she commit suicide?

281
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:26,808
Tell me why.

282
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:36,985
Because the operation didn't work.

283
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,697
What?

284
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,366
lt didn't work.

285
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:48,246
Dr Roman told me yesterday.

286
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,380
l was waiting for the right moment
to tell you.

287
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,028
That man exists.

288
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:22,864
Julia, Julia.

289
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:25,950
- Anything else l should know?
- l was only trying to protect you.

290
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:28,912
- From what?
- From the truth.

291
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,705
What's the truth?

292
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:35,960
Sara committed suicide because
she couldn't stand being blind.

293
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:46,388
Julia.

294
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:48,723
Julia.

295
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:54,562
Did you know she came here
with her boyfriend?

296
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:56,356
That doesn't prove anything.

297
00:30:56,564 --> 00:31:02,028
And why is he hiding?
Why didn't he show up at the funeral?

298
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:04,906
Maybe he wasn't with her by then.

299
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:10,870
Maybe he left her when he found out
she'd never recover her sight.

300
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,792
That easy?

301
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:17,669
That easy, right?

302
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:20,255
- Well...
- l can't believe you're a psychologist.

303
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:22,507
Julia!

304
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,344
God!

305
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,267
What are you doing?

306
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:33,768
Julia, Julia.

307
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,645
Didn't you see the car?

308
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:44,446
You didn't see it, did you?

309
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:52,620
How many seizures have you had?

310
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:53,913
Two.

311
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,207
Shit!

312
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,294
Shit.

313
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:08,595
lf...

314
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:14,184
- lf l go blind... When l go blind...
- No, no. That won't happen.

315
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:19,356
Not wanting it
doesn't mean it won't happen.

316
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:27,781
lsaac...

317
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:33,536
One time you told me that...

318
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:39,542
...when you looked into my eyes,
you could see the entire universe.

319
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:45,757
- l still can.
- What if the universe shuts down?

320
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,348
Olose your eyes.

321
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,184
What?

322
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:58,436
Olose your eyes.

323
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:07,404
Oan you see me?

324
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:11,032
Of course l can't.

325
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:15,662
Then how do you know
l'm still here with you?

326
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:18,373
Because l can hear you.

327
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:23,044
What if l remain silent?

328
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:25,922
How do you know l'm still here?

329
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:42,856
l can touch you.

330
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:48,111
And you can smell me.

331
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:52,866
And kiss you.

332
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:19,976
Promise me that when the day comes,
we will go back to the desert.

333
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,687
What?

334
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:24,814
You know?

335
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:29,319
The last thing l'd like to see
is that sky, with you.

336
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,448
- Julia...
- Promise me.

337
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:36,117
Promise me.

338
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,579
l promise you.

339
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,333
But...

340
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:46,127
But you have to promise me...

341
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:50,632
...that you will stop chasing ghosts.

342
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:54,511
And that we will go and see Dr Roman.

343
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:57,222
Tomorrow.

344
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:00,850
OK.

345
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:22,122
l'll bring the luggage to the car.
l'll wait for you outside.

346
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:23,665
ln 15 minutes.

347
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,426
Ms Levin.

348
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:39,014
Ms Levin.

349
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:42,642
l'm really sorry for your loss.

350
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:46,396
My name is Oréspulo.

351
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:50,066
l read about your sister
in the obituaries section of the newspaper.

352
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,735
Thank you.

353
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:54,195
l have something of hers.

354
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:59,534
A few hours after your sister left,

355
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:05,206
l found a key in her room,
under the bed.

356
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:09,210
l think l put it here somewhere.

357
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:20,013
Thank you.

358
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,235
Mr Oréspulo.

359
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:36,404
l'm sorry.

360
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:40,408
Mr Oréspulo...

361
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:42,952
My sister came here with a man,
didn't she?

362
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:45,538
The invisible man.

363
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,210
l beg your pardon?

364
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:56,800
Nobody remembers the man
who came with your sister, right?

365
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,513
Well...

366
00:37:01,846 --> 00:37:04,015
That doesn't mean he is invisible.

367
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,810
There are people with no light.

368
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:11,314
Do you know what it's like to walk in
somewhere and not be noticed?

369
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:17,654
Or to walk on the street
and have people stumble against you?

370
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:24,953
Or to ask something for the third time
and have no one answer your question?

371
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:27,580
That's the man you're looking for.

372
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:31,209
A pause, a vacuum.

373
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:34,129
An absence.

374
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:37,924
That's why nobody remembers him.

375
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:40,760
Nobody except you.

376
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:47,017
ln a way, l am also invisible.

377
00:37:48,518 --> 00:37:52,439
lt's been many years since the last time
someone remembered me.

378
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:56,276
This man...

379
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:59,320
do you know where l can find him?

380
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,784
What are you afraid of?

381
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:10,749
He parked his van in a car park
two blocks down the street.

382
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:16,755
There's a OOTV camera
recording 24 hours a day.

383
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:20,133
Thank you.

384
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,010
Wait!

385
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:23,553
Be careful.

386
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:29,184
The man who was with your sister
had very angry eyes.

387
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:32,103
He knows how to be a shadow.

388
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:36,691
lf someone feels invisible
and is angry at the world,

389
00:38:36,858 --> 00:38:38,818
he can be dangerous.

390
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:41,446
He has no light.
Nobody looks at him.

391
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:45,075
He could sneak up on you and...

392
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:12,811
- Where have you been?
- Did you see anyone?

393
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:16,648
- l've been waiting for 10 minutes.
- Wait a moment.

394
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:19,943
He's here.
And l know how to find him.

395
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,324
- No!
- What are you doing?

396
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:29,119
- Let me talk to the guard.
- Will you calm down?

397
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,746
- Oalm down!
- Wait here.

398
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:34,040
Don't be so rude!

399
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:37,377
l remind you
that you made a promise last night.

400
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:39,087
- Enough.
- l can't take it any more!

401
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:41,589
- l said don't yell at me!
- l've had it!

402
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:43,842
There's no mystery in Sara's death!

403
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,303
Do you want the footage?
You'll have it.

404
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,141
But this shit ends
right here, right now, all right?

405
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:15,790
You've reached...

406
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:42,650
Excuse me.

407
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:46,321
Has anyone been here
asking about security videos?

408
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:49,741
Look... l don't want any trouble, OK?

409
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:52,994
That guy came, gave me some money
and l promised to keep my mouth shut.

410
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:56,247
He is my husband.
l've been waiting for a while.

411
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:59,042
Do you know which way he went out?

412
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:04,339
He left as soon as my little friend
made the copies he wanted.

413
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:06,132
And...

414
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,259
Was there anyone else here?

415
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,387
- Are you sure?
- Nobody.

416
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:14,349
We can check the monitors
in case we see something.

417
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:16,976
What the hell?

418
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:24,984
l'll be right back.

419
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:31,741
Goddammit!

420
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What's wrong?

421
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:43,211
Oalm down. lt's me.

422
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,505
Someone has switched off the power.

423
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:50,677
lt's impossible.

424
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:53,513
lt's impossible.

425
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,624
My husband has been kidnapped.
He's in danger.

426
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:25,545
OK, the only thing we know is that
someone stole some OOTV footage.

427
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:30,967
No, l've already told you.
lt was the man who was with my sister.

428
00:42:31,092 --> 00:42:34,054
You have to find him
before it's too late.

429
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:39,309
How can we find someone
that nobody has seen, not even you?

430
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:45,815
Oréspulo.

431
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:37,033
- He killed him because he was...
- No evidence of violence.

432
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,994
...the only who could recognise
the invisible man.

433
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:43,039
- He's erasing his tracks.
- What do you mean?

434
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:45,542
My husband is in danger!

435
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:48,169
- Oalm down, madam!
- lsaac!

436
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,672
Oall a doctor, quick.

437
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:53,675
We need a doctor down here.

438
00:43:57,721 --> 00:43:58,763
lsaac.

439
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:17,449
The process is irreversible.

440
00:44:17,657 --> 00:44:19,409
How long do l have?

441
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:23,705
l don't know...
Perhaps a few hours, days.

442
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:26,833
Maybe a few weeks.
Definitely less than a month.

443
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:29,878
We have to find a donor
and operate as soon as possible.

444
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:31,880
Did you know Sara's boyfriend?

445
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:36,593
No, l didn't know him.

446
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:41,473
Julia, l know you're going through
a hard time,

447
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:44,601
but you have to think about yourself.

448
00:44:44,809 --> 00:44:48,813
So, please,
try to avoid emotional stress.

449
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:52,400
And don't force your eyes. OK?

450
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:06,956
lvan. lvan.

451
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:23,556
A boyfriend?

452
00:45:23,682 --> 00:45:27,060
Sara never told me
about any boyfriends.

453
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:29,813
She didn't trust men.

454
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:32,023
Unlike me.

455
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:35,026
- Or you.
- lsaac hasn't left me, l'm sure.

456
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:38,154
That's what all women think.

457
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:42,534
l also came up with a story
when my husband left me.

458
00:45:43,326 --> 00:45:46,663
He couldn't stand my son Ángel.

459
00:45:46,871 --> 00:45:50,250
And my son was more important
than anything else.

460
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:55,880
Then my eyes started to degenerate
and l went blind.

461
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:59,509
Luckily, Ángel looked after me
for 10 years,

462
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:03,555
until l woke up one morning...

463
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:05,724
and he was gone.

464
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:07,934
My son was gone.

465
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,731
What kind of son abandons
a blind mother?

466
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:16,151
l had to come up with a story.

467
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:18,945
And l still keep to it.

468
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:23,158
Such humiliation!
l'm sorry.

469
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:34,294
Hello?

470
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:37,756
The hotel is fully automated.
There are no staff.

471
00:46:37,964 --> 00:46:40,675
Guests check in through a machine.

472
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,346
They called from the bank this morning
to inform me about a transaction

473
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,639
with your husband's credit card.

474
00:46:46,848 --> 00:46:51,644
l searched the room
and found this on the bedside table.

475
00:46:52,562 --> 00:46:55,982
Julia, there's things about your husband
you don't know.

476
00:46:57,233 --> 00:47:01,488
- He kept Sara's surgery from you.
- To protect me. The doctor told me...

477
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:05,367
The doctor didn't talk to anybody
about the surgery.

478
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:09,496
How did your husband know?

479
00:47:09,704 --> 00:47:15,752
lnspector, a patrol just drove by
Sara's house and saw light inside.

480
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:23,343
lsaac?

481
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:27,430
Wait here. Don't move.

482
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:01,214
lsaac?

483
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:23,236
Hello?

484
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:27,490
lsaac?

485
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
lsaac?

486
00:48:46,384 --> 00:48:47,927
Julia!

487
00:48:49,054 --> 00:48:52,057
Shit! l have to get out of here.

488
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:55,226
Where is it? Stay calm.

489
00:48:55,935 --> 00:48:59,314
Where is the door? Stay calm.

490
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:03,193
Julia? Julia?

491
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:10,408
lnspector! There's somebody
down here. lnspector!

492
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:16,081
Julia, calm down. lt's me.

493
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:21,628
There's somebody here.

494
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,131
There's somebody here.

495
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,519
What's wrong?

496
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:39,145
What's wrong?

497
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:43,942
Turn on the torch.
l hate darkness.

498
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:48,780
Please, say something.
Why aren't you saying anything?

499
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:06,506
Thank you.

500
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:11,177
Hi.

501
00:50:15,181 --> 00:50:18,101
There's something
you should know, Julia.

502
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:21,479
Your husband left a letter.

503
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:26,526
We checked the handwriting
and there is no doubt it's his.

504
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,362
Listen...

505
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:34,284
Sara and lsaac
had been lovers for six months.

506
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:37,746
He apologises in the letter.

507
00:50:38,538 --> 00:50:44,210
That explains the numerous calls to her
we found on his mobile phone.

508
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:49,341
Did you know
they were in touch lately?

509
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:01,478
Think, Julia.

510
00:51:01,686 --> 00:51:05,732
Did lsaac insist on getting the video?

511
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,403
Probably because he didn't want you
to see him on it.

512
00:51:11,654 --> 00:51:17,452
Then he went back to the motel and
decided he couldn't live without Sara.

513
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:23,792
l'm sorry, but everything makes sense.

514
00:51:37,972 --> 00:51:40,684
We found a donor.
We can operate tomorrow.

515
00:51:40,892 --> 00:51:43,186
You just have to sign here.

516
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:51,903
Thank you.

517
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,759
Oalm down, Julia!

518
00:52:15,343 --> 00:52:19,222
Oalm down. Sleep a bit more.

519
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:25,812
OK, Julia... Everything went well.

520
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:29,357
But we have to be careful now.

521
00:52:29,524 --> 00:52:33,737
You eyes must be protected
from the light for two weeks.

522
00:52:34,195 --> 00:52:36,489
And don't manipulate
the bandages yourself.

523
00:52:36,698 --> 00:52:40,785
lf you remove them too soon,
there won't be a solution.

524
00:52:40,952 --> 00:52:44,497
But don't worry,
you will be taken care of.

525
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:46,374
No.

526
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:49,502
l'd rather go home.
l hate hospitals.

527
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:52,464
l know,
but l'm afraid that's impossible.

528
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:57,510
- You need supervision.
- l could... go to my sister's house.

529
00:52:57,677 --> 00:53:00,305
l know my way around it very well.

530
00:53:02,223 --> 00:53:05,143
Julia, honestly,
l don't think it's a good idea.

531
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:09,147
Right, but if l can't see, l can't feel.

532
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:16,321
All right, let's do this.
You can go to your sister's house.

533
00:53:16,446 --> 00:53:20,617
But a care worker will visit you
every day, OK?

534
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:29,584
Julia, there's something else.

535
00:53:31,419 --> 00:53:34,839
Your husband's body is still here.
l can take care of it if you want.

536
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:36,841
No.

537
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:41,554
l'd rather do it myself.

538
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:45,934
Oould you keep the body
until l can see again?

539
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:48,895
l need to say goodbye to him.

540
00:53:59,698 --> 00:54:02,117
Let's sit on the sofa. Slowly.

541
00:54:02,283 --> 00:54:04,202
Keep walking...

542
00:54:04,536 --> 00:54:07,372
- Here are your things.
- Thank you.

543
00:54:08,748 --> 00:54:12,085
- Oareful. Don't worry.
- No problem.

544
00:54:16,047 --> 00:54:19,009
Shall we wait here
until the care worker arrives?

545
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:22,012
- Oan you do me a favour?
- Sure. What is it?

546
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:24,681
l'd like to know what this key opens.

547
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:38,862
Whatever it is this key opens,
it's not here.

548
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:42,282
- Did you try every lock?
- l did.

549
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:44,826
Do you need anything else?

550
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:46,661
No, thank you.

551
00:54:46,828 --> 00:54:49,456
- You can go.
- All right.

552
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:01,194
- Hello?
- Hi.

553
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:04,614
You must be Julia.
l'm lvan, the care worker.

554
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:08,702
Sorry l'm late. The traffic was bad.
l phoned you, but it got cut off.

555
00:56:11,996 --> 00:56:14,541
l would have preferred a woman.

556
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,587
lf you want to call Dr Roman...
What happened to your hand?

557
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:28,304
lt's just a scratch. You won't
feel anything tomorrow morning.

558
00:56:29,347 --> 00:56:33,685
l will make you dinner
and clean up a bit. You stay here.

559
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:36,312
By the way...

560
00:56:37,772 --> 00:56:40,817
What should l do with the glasses?

561
00:56:40,942 --> 00:56:42,527
Throw them out.

562
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,285
While you ate,
l familiarised myself with the house.

563
00:56:51,244 --> 00:56:52,787
Julia.

564
00:56:55,915 --> 00:56:58,710
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. l have to go.

565
00:56:58,918 --> 00:57:00,670
What time is it?

566
00:57:00,837 --> 00:57:02,922
lt's nine o'clock.

567
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:05,508
On the first days,
we lose track of time.

568
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:10,305
l'll give you a couple
of sleeping pills, just in case.

569
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:13,308
And also a pager.

570
00:57:13,516 --> 00:57:17,312
lf you want to contact me,
press this button. Give me your hand.

571
00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:20,523
Look, here's the button.

572
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:30,325
Let's go.

573
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:33,286
- What are you doing?
- l have to put you to bed.

574
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:37,707
- Sorry, but l can do it myself.
- Are you sure?

575
00:57:46,716 --> 00:57:48,510
Are you OK?

576
00:57:49,552 --> 00:57:51,930
OK, you win.

577
00:57:52,138 --> 00:57:54,265
Put me to bed and then you can go.

578
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:22,043
Who's there?

579
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:29,759
Oalm down.
Oalm down, darling.

580
00:58:30,844 --> 00:58:32,429
lt's me.

581
00:58:32,595 --> 00:58:34,431
lsaac?

582
00:58:36,307 --> 00:58:37,517
lsaac?

583
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,770
How can this be?

584
00:58:46,317 --> 00:58:48,862
Don't say anything.

585
00:58:50,196 --> 00:58:51,948
Thank you.

586
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:58,580
- What are you doing?
- Taking this dirty bandage off.

587
00:58:59,247 --> 00:59:02,250
- So you can see me better.
- No!

588
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:06,129
That's it, that's it.

589
00:59:06,796 --> 00:59:10,258
Leave me alone.
Get off me! Get off me!

590
00:59:10,967 --> 00:59:16,514
Don't resist, little sister.
We're two against one.

591
00:59:21,353 --> 00:59:22,979
Don't move.

592
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:25,148
No, stop!

593
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:28,735
Get off me!

594
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:07,399
lvan. lvan.

595
01:00:07,607 --> 01:00:09,818
JuIia, is everything OK?

596
01:00:09,943 --> 01:00:13,613
- l think there's someone in the house.
- What?

597
01:00:13,822 --> 01:00:16,074
ln the room next door.

598
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:20,412
- Don't move. I'II caII the poIice.
- No, lvan, lvan.

599
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:36,553
Are you stiII there?

600
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:41,683
You have to get me out of here
right now.

601
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:45,186
- Where are you?
- ln the guest room.

602
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:48,064
That's good.
Find the door and get out of the room.

603
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:52,569
Find the door to your right.

604
01:00:54,654 --> 01:00:56,239
- He's there.
- CaIm down.

605
01:00:56,364 --> 01:00:59,242
The handraiI is in front of you.
Look for it.

606
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:00,910
OK, yes.

607
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:03,371
HoId onto the handraiI.

608
01:01:03,538 --> 01:01:06,541
Go down the six steps
to the first Ianding.

609
01:01:10,628 --> 01:01:12,922
Then there's nine more.

610
01:01:15,383 --> 01:01:16,926
JuIia...

611
01:01:18,053 --> 01:01:23,224
- l'm downstairs. What now?
- FoIIow the waII to the door.

612
01:01:30,523 --> 01:01:32,400
Who are you?
Who are you?

613
01:01:32,609 --> 01:01:34,361
- What's going on?
- l don't know.

614
01:01:34,527 --> 01:01:37,238
Get out of the houseI QuickI

615
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:57,217
There is no indication
that someone entered the house.

616
01:01:57,342 --> 01:02:01,054
There was someone there.
And he was looking for something.

617
01:02:01,262 --> 01:02:04,683
Sorry, but there's nothing else
l can do.

618
01:02:08,603 --> 01:02:10,814
- Do you want me to call the hospital?
- Why?

619
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:14,776
Maybe you shouldn't recover here,
considering what you've been through.

620
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:16,736
You don't believe me either.

621
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:22,367
l'm just saying that in your situation,
it's normal if your senses deceive you.

622
01:02:22,575 --> 01:02:25,787
Don't open your eyes now.

623
01:02:27,622 --> 01:02:29,666
You can let go now.

624
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:33,128
What's the matter?

625
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:36,965
My eyes could get damaged, right?

626
01:02:37,173 --> 01:02:41,970
No, l only want to change the bandage,
and l took precautions.

627
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:45,223
l've done this a hundred times.
Don't worry.

628
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:52,397
You know, when l was 20 years old,

629
01:02:52,522 --> 01:02:55,650
l had a car accident
and l was blind for two months.

630
01:02:57,652 --> 01:03:03,616
And like you now,
l imagined things and had nightmares.

631
01:03:03,825 --> 01:03:06,244
And l rejected the care worker's help.

632
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,624
l couldn't stand the idea
of going blind.

633
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,300
ln the end, l recovered my sight.

634
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:25,847
But during those months...

635
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:30,393
...l understood what it was like
to live in the dark.

636
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:36,816
That's why l became a care worker.

637
01:03:37,984 --> 01:03:40,403
You made that up
to make me feel better.

638
01:03:40,528 --> 01:03:44,115
No, no. Oall the hospital
if you don't believe me.

639
01:03:44,657 --> 01:03:50,288
Julia, l know you're scared,
but the only way to lose that fear

640
01:03:50,413 --> 01:03:52,332
is to fight it.

641
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:00,924
What do you say?

642
01:04:03,426 --> 01:04:05,345
Will you let me help you?

643
01:04:14,854 --> 01:04:16,564
- What happened?
- You spilled it.

644
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:20,485
Try to get to the door.
Follow the wall with your hand...

645
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:26,241
And after the glass cabinet...

646
01:04:49,848 --> 01:04:53,435
Well, l have my ups and downs.

647
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,854
But l slept very well
the last few nights.

648
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:59,232
lvan has been
very patient with me all week.

649
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:01,443
Yes, he takes good care of me.

650
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:04,779
l will. l will, yes.

651
01:05:04,946 --> 01:05:07,032
Thanks a lot for calling. Bye.

652
01:05:08,783 --> 01:05:12,370
- Are you leaving?
- Yes. lt's a little late.

653
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:14,622
Why don't stay a bit longer?

654
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,917
A little while.

655
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:20,378
- Are you still afraid?
- No.

656
01:05:20,545 --> 01:05:22,255
No, it's not that.

657
01:05:23,173 --> 01:05:24,883
Never mind.

658
01:05:27,177 --> 01:05:29,471
OK, should l make
a special dinner for two?

659
01:05:31,306 --> 01:05:34,684
- Go and watch TV. l'll cook.
- That's a little difficult.

660
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:59,376
Aren't you drinking too much?

661
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:02,170
l'm celebrating.

662
01:06:02,295 --> 01:06:03,838
What?

663
01:06:03,963 --> 01:06:07,634
That in four days,

664
01:06:07,842 --> 01:06:11,096
l will have the bandages removed
and l will see again.

665
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:14,808
Everything will be all right, Julia.

666
01:06:16,184 --> 01:06:18,269
You know,

667
01:06:18,436 --> 01:06:22,607
if the operation doesn't work,
l couldn't complain.

668
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:26,319
l have seen everything l wanted to see.

669
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:31,157
What's the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

670
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:34,244
Funny!

671
01:06:34,452 --> 01:06:36,871
How ironic that you ask me that.

672
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,748
Why?

673
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:45,213
Because l spent my whole life
looking for invisible planets.

674
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:48,633
My eyes have seen amazing things.

675
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:55,390
But nothing can compare
to the sky in the Sahara.

676
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:00,854
That's where l met lsaac.

677
01:07:01,062 --> 01:07:06,317
We were on the same excursion
and we spent the whole night...

678
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:09,988
...staring at the sky.

679
01:07:10,947 --> 01:07:15,326
l asked him, ''ls that not the most
beautiful thing you've ever seen?''

680
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:18,496
And he said, ''Yes.''

681
01:07:24,252 --> 01:07:26,588
When l turned my head,

682
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:31,343
l realised that he'd been watching me
for a while and l got nervous.

683
01:07:32,469 --> 01:07:34,471
And l asked him...

684
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:40,101
...''Why aren't you watching
the universe?''

685
01:07:40,769 --> 01:07:45,899
And he said,
''l don't have to look up to do it.''

686
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:50,570
''l can see the universe in your eyes.''

687
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:54,699
And what happened?

688
01:07:57,494 --> 01:07:59,412
l came close.

689
01:08:00,663 --> 01:08:02,248
l touched him.

690
01:08:03,249 --> 01:08:06,544
And l realised that he was nervous too.

691
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:11,299
ln that moment it was as if
we became one person.

692
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:14,344
And l wanted to know
if he felt the same.

693
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,805
What did he say?

694
01:08:17,847 --> 01:08:19,474
Nothing.

695
01:08:21,142 --> 01:08:23,687
He replied with his gaze.

696
01:08:23,895 --> 01:08:25,522
Why?

697
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:29,317
Why did he look at me that way? Why?

698
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:34,823
- Do you prefer l hadn't done it?
- l don't know.

699
01:08:35,573 --> 01:08:40,954
When you had the affair with Sara,
l thought it was just an indiscretion,

700
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:44,457
but l swear l don't know
what to think any more.

701
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:47,544
l don't know what to think.

702
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,633
Everything will be all right, Julia.

703
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:57,595
You promise?

704
01:08:59,347 --> 01:09:01,307
l promise.

705
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:21,119
No, l can't.

706
01:09:21,327 --> 01:09:23,413
l can't do it.

707
01:09:23,955 --> 01:09:26,041
lt's not right.

708
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:34,257
- lvan.
- Don't say anything.

709
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:37,802
- l'm sorry.
- Don't be. Don't say anything.

710
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:40,347
l'll call the hospital
and ask to be replaced.

711
01:09:40,555 --> 01:09:42,307
ls that what you want?

712
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:45,727
And you?

713
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:56,613
OK, l'll come back tomorrow and...

714
01:09:57,489 --> 01:10:00,492
lf not, just contact me on my pager.

715
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

716
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:33,418
Help! Help!

717
01:11:35,795 --> 01:11:37,297
Help!

718
01:11:38,965 --> 01:11:43,136
Oalm down!
l'm Blasco, the neighbour! Lia's father!

719
01:11:43,345 --> 01:11:45,805
Oall the police, please!

720
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:49,559
Oalm down!
You need a drink.

721
01:11:49,726 --> 01:11:53,355
No, no.
Oall the police, please.

722
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:57,567
Why do you want to call the police?
To tell another one of your nightmares?

723
01:11:57,734 --> 01:12:01,863
- The last time they didn't believe you.
- No. There was someone by my bed.

724
01:12:02,072 --> 01:12:03,865
l swear, this time it's true.

725
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:06,785
And what did he want?
To rape you?

726
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:10,497
lt's my daughter.
Don't be afraid.

727
01:12:10,663 --> 01:12:12,832
l told you not to sneak up on people!

728
01:12:12,999 --> 01:12:15,043
Go back to your bed!

729
01:12:15,418 --> 01:12:17,921
And close the door!

730
01:12:18,088 --> 01:12:20,215
Mr Blasco...

731
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:23,510
Oan you call now, please?

732
01:12:26,888 --> 01:12:30,433
Of course, of course.
Don't worry.

733
01:12:32,644 --> 01:12:35,563
How strange.
There's no line.

734
01:12:38,066 --> 01:12:40,068
Oalm down.

735
01:12:40,193 --> 01:12:42,320
l'll get the mobile phone.

736
01:13:18,648 --> 01:13:23,903
The mobile is out of battery.
lt will take a few minutes to charge.

737
01:13:25,989 --> 01:13:30,160
Sit down, sit down.

738
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:32,537
Sit down.

739
01:13:33,413 --> 01:13:34,622
What do you say?

740
01:13:34,789 --> 01:13:40,628
Do you want something to drink
while we wait?

741
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:44,758
- What do you say?
- Oould l have a glass of water?

742
01:13:44,883 --> 01:13:49,888
- Water?
- Yes, my throat is a bit dry.

743
01:14:07,072 --> 01:14:10,241
Julia, where are you going?

744
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:12,744
Hey!

745
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:15,038
Hey!

746
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:18,958
Madam!
Where are you, madam?

747
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:20,960
Madam!

748
01:14:22,295 --> 01:14:24,798
Please, pick up.

749
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:27,300
lvan.

750
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,386
Pick up, please.

751
01:14:29,552 --> 01:14:30,595
JuIia, what's wrong?

752
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:45,944
- Julia!
- lvan!

753
01:14:46,111 --> 01:14:49,447
- Let's go to your house.
- Not my house.

754
01:14:49,614 --> 01:14:51,950
- Julia, calm down.
- No, my house is not safe.

755
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:54,786
Please. Take me to your place.

756
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,206
OK.

757
01:14:58,415 --> 01:15:01,668
OK, thanks. Bye.

758
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,755
What did they say?

759
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:09,968
lnspector Dimas
won't be on duty until seven.

760
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:15,640
You should get some rest
and l'll go with you tomorrow morning.

761
01:15:15,807 --> 01:15:19,769
Julia, l won't let anyone hurt you.

762
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:22,939
You can sleep in my bed.

763
01:15:23,106 --> 01:15:25,900
- And you?
- l have a mattress. l'll be right back.

764
01:15:26,067 --> 01:15:30,321
- No, no.
- l'll be right back. You're safe here.

765
01:15:30,488 --> 01:15:32,240
l'll be back in a minute.

766
01:15:48,089 --> 01:15:49,716
lvan?

767
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

768
01:16:30,548 --> 01:16:32,300
- Who are you?
- l'm Lia.

769
01:16:32,467 --> 01:16:34,010
- Who are you?
- Lia Blasco.

770
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:36,054
Don't get close.
How did you find me?

771
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:39,557
- l followed you. l was Sara's friend.
- l said don't come close.

772
01:16:39,724 --> 01:16:43,478
Listen, my father
has nothing to do with all this.

773
01:16:43,687 --> 01:16:47,524
- Your father lied to me.
- My father is lonely, and you're hot.

774
01:16:47,691 --> 01:16:48,983
l don't believe you.

775
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:52,696
l was the one who took the key
and have been spying on you.

776
01:16:52,862 --> 01:16:54,739
- You?
- Do you have nightmares?

777
01:16:54,906 --> 01:16:57,701
- What?
- Sara also had them.

778
01:16:57,867 --> 01:17:02,539
She dreamt of someone taking the bandage
off and piercing her eyes with needles.

779
01:17:02,706 --> 01:17:04,124
There's a monster on the street,

780
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:06,918
but no one can see him
because he hides in the darkness.

781
01:17:07,043 --> 01:17:09,254
He made Sara go blind
and will do the same with you.

782
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:11,006
- Stop!
- lt's him.

783
01:17:11,172 --> 01:17:14,801
l followed him and tried the key.
And today l saw the needles again.

784
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:18,179
- lt's him, Julia. lt's the care worker.
- No.

785
01:17:19,639 --> 01:17:22,017
Listen to me!

786
01:17:23,476 --> 01:17:26,646
Do you really think lsaac
killed himself? He loved you.

787
01:17:26,813 --> 01:17:31,151
- He loved Sara more.
- They didn't want to worry you.

788
01:17:31,317 --> 01:17:33,987
That's why they kept you in the dark.
Sara told me.

789
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:36,614
lsaac wrote a suicide note.
Leave me alone.

790
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:40,744
- The monster forced him to write it.
- Monsters don't exist. Enough!

791
01:17:40,952 --> 01:17:42,704
This one does.

792
01:17:44,372 --> 01:17:46,541
He collects pictures.

793
01:17:46,916 --> 01:17:51,087
His wall is covered
with pictures of you and Sara.

794
01:17:51,838 --> 01:17:55,425
- He removed your eyes.
- Lia, that's enough!

795
01:17:55,633 --> 01:17:57,010
Leave me alone!

796
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:00,930
What are you doing?

797
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:06,144
Use the key if you don't believe me.

798
01:18:07,854 --> 01:18:10,357
The key. Where's the key?

799
01:18:10,523 --> 01:18:12,692
- He took it.
- No, you took it.

800
01:18:12,817 --> 01:18:16,654
- Why me?
- l don't know. To protect your father.

801
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:20,325
- lt's him. Don't tell him l'm here.
- Lia. Lia.

802
01:18:24,287 --> 01:18:25,497
lvan?

803
01:18:25,663 --> 01:18:28,333
Julia, what are you doing?

804
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,752
l'm really nervous.

805
01:18:31,795 --> 01:18:34,297
l'll make you a cup of tea.

806
01:18:34,464 --> 01:18:36,257
lt will help you relax.

807
01:18:37,008 --> 01:18:39,594
- lvan...
- Yes?

808
01:18:40,637 --> 01:18:45,308
l can't find the key. lt's the only
evidence to incriminate Blasco.

809
01:18:46,017 --> 01:18:48,228
Did you take it?

810
01:19:01,032 --> 01:19:03,827
- You must have dropped it.
- Please, give it to me.

811
01:19:03,993 --> 01:19:06,204
l'll keep it for you.
You are very nervous.

812
01:19:06,371 --> 01:19:10,000
l'll make you a cup of tea.
You sit down and relax.

813
01:19:18,758 --> 01:19:21,553
He's lying. He had the key.

814
01:19:21,678 --> 01:19:24,222
- We have to get out of here.
- l don't want to.

815
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:27,934
- You don't believe me now?
- lt's impossible. He is a care worker.

816
01:19:30,603 --> 01:19:33,314
Shit! lt's locked.

817
01:19:34,733 --> 01:19:36,526
- Julia!
- Yes?

818
01:19:37,652 --> 01:19:40,363
- Do you want sugar?
- Two teaspoons, thanks.

819
01:19:44,534 --> 01:19:46,619
He wants to drug you and make you blind.

820
01:19:46,786 --> 01:19:47,912
What are you saying?

821
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:50,457
- Oan you take this off?
- No. Why?

822
01:19:50,623 --> 01:19:55,128
Then we can't get out of the window.
l need to get the key.

823
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:58,506
Get rid of him
and wait for me in the bathroom.

824
01:20:00,925 --> 01:20:03,011
Here you go.

825
01:20:03,845 --> 01:20:07,474
l'll take you to bed
and wait until you fall asleep.

826
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:15,106
l need to go to the bathroom.

827
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:18,234
OK.

828
01:20:22,447 --> 01:20:23,782
Thank you.

829
01:21:01,152 --> 01:21:04,781
- Julia, is everything all right?
- Yes. What was that noise?

830
01:21:04,948 --> 01:21:07,033
l don't know. l heard it too.

831
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,661
l thought something had happened to you.

832
01:21:09,828 --> 01:21:13,832
- Hurry up, or your tea will get cold.
- l'll be right out.

833
01:21:18,461 --> 01:21:21,756
Lia, please.

834
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:26,720
Four days left. Only four days.

835
01:21:28,972 --> 01:21:31,391
Four days, four days.

836
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:48,575
Julia, l have to go down again.
Are you OK?

837
01:21:48,742 --> 01:21:51,327
Yes, l'll be right out.

838
01:23:11,908 --> 01:23:13,618
Lia.

839
01:23:15,078 --> 01:23:16,204
Lia.

840
01:23:48,486 --> 01:23:50,655
What are you doing here?

841
01:23:53,783 --> 01:23:55,910
Why are you crying?

842
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:00,665
Please, answer me.

843
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:06,338
A girl called Lia came to see me.

844
01:24:06,504 --> 01:24:08,757
Blasco's daughter.

845
01:24:08,965 --> 01:24:11,051
And she made me very nervous.

846
01:24:11,217 --> 01:24:15,180
- Why did you take the bandage off?
- l couldn't see anything.

847
01:24:15,347 --> 01:24:19,851
She told me horrible things about you
and l was afraid.

848
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:22,145
About me?

849
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:25,857
You would never hurt me, would you?

850
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:28,568
No.

851
01:24:29,152 --> 01:24:31,112
l had to...

852
01:24:31,237 --> 01:24:34,449
l had to see your face to know it.

853
01:24:35,867 --> 01:24:38,119
And what did you see?

854
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,920
Nothing. l can't see anything.

855
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,613
Are you sure you can't see anything?

856
01:25:23,164 --> 01:25:25,458
Sometimes the eyes
take time to adjust.

857
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:41,516
The operation didn't work.

858
01:25:49,107 --> 01:25:51,526
l'm really sorry, Julia.

859
01:25:55,655 --> 01:25:59,284
Probably the girl lied to you
in order to protect her father.

860
01:26:01,494 --> 01:26:05,331
Tomorrow... we'll speak with
the inspector and all this will be over.

861
01:26:05,498 --> 01:26:08,501
No. No.

862
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:11,796
No, please.
Take me to the hospital now.

863
01:26:12,005 --> 01:26:15,550
- Now, please.
- We'll call Dr Roman.

864
01:26:16,134 --> 01:26:19,721
- Now.
- Julia, listen to me.

865
01:26:21,931 --> 01:26:23,725
Dr Roman?

866
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:27,854
lt's lvan. Sorry to wake you
at this time of night.

867
01:26:28,021 --> 01:26:30,732
l have a problem with Julia Levin.

868
01:26:32,525 --> 01:26:35,570
She took the bandage off by accident.

869
01:26:43,745 --> 01:26:48,958
l understand. l will tell her right now.
Thanks, and sorry to bother you.

870
01:26:50,377 --> 01:26:51,419
What did he say?

871
01:26:51,628 --> 01:26:54,506
He's at a conference.
We can't do anything until next week.

872
01:26:54,714 --> 01:26:58,927
- Then take me to a different hospital.
- No. Roman said you have to rest.

873
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:04,516
- l need a second opinion.
- Julia, the damage is done.

874
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:07,644
But if you don't do as l say,
it will be irreversible.

875
01:27:16,069 --> 01:27:17,404
OK.

876
01:27:50,186 --> 01:27:51,855
Why did you get up?

877
01:27:52,063 --> 01:27:56,901
- The kettle was whistling.
- l'll do it. You sit down.

878
01:27:57,694 --> 01:27:59,362
Be careful.

879
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:03,658
Very good.

880
01:28:14,711 --> 01:28:16,171
This is nearly ready.

881
01:28:32,645 --> 01:28:34,481
Here you are.

882
01:28:35,273 --> 01:28:36,900
Thank you.

883
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:55,085
What's the matter?

884
01:29:00,465 --> 01:29:02,342
Why are you doing all this, lvan?

885
01:29:09,349 --> 01:29:10,975
What do you mean?

886
01:29:11,142 --> 01:29:13,603
Why all this attention?

887
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:18,817
What do you want from me?

888
01:29:20,735 --> 01:29:22,862
Well, Julia...

889
01:29:26,741 --> 01:29:28,660
When...

890
01:29:29,494 --> 01:29:31,037
When you kissed me...

891
01:29:33,998 --> 01:29:36,751
l didn't expect it.

892
01:29:36,876 --> 01:29:41,715
l didn't expect it, but don't think
l don't like you because...

893
01:29:41,881 --> 01:29:43,133
because that's not true.

894
01:29:46,136 --> 01:29:50,015
l only wanted to give you some time.
You've suffered a lot.

895
01:29:50,181 --> 01:29:54,060
And some wounds need to heal.

896
01:29:55,979 --> 01:29:58,523
What l'm trying to say is...

897
01:30:00,066 --> 01:30:02,152
...l want to be with you.

898
01:30:07,824 --> 01:30:09,701
Drink your tea.

899
01:30:26,801 --> 01:30:28,678
Did you put sugar in it?

900
01:30:32,974 --> 01:30:35,018
l'll bring some.

901
01:31:02,796 --> 01:31:04,422
Two teaspoons, right?

902
01:31:05,632 --> 01:31:07,217
As usual.

903
01:31:14,599 --> 01:31:15,642
Done?

904
01:31:30,407 --> 01:31:32,492
Oan you come with me, please?

905
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:39,332
- Why?
- l need your help with the freezer.

906
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:43,920
Oome. Let's go. Leave this here.

907
01:32:09,821 --> 01:32:11,614
Open the freezer.

908
01:32:11,781 --> 01:32:13,324
Why?

909
01:32:13,491 --> 01:32:15,577
Just do it.

910
01:32:17,746 --> 01:32:20,415
Open the freezer, l said.

911
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:52,489
Liar.

912
01:33:14,594 --> 01:33:16,596
Are you afraid?

913
01:33:26,856 --> 01:33:31,152
You don't know what fear is!

914
01:33:33,446 --> 01:33:37,492
You have no idea what fear is!

915
01:33:37,617 --> 01:33:38,910
Real fear.

916
01:33:39,077 --> 01:33:41,413
Fear of being ignored and rejected.

917
01:33:41,579 --> 01:33:44,541
Look at me. Look at me!

918
01:33:44,708 --> 01:33:48,169
You don't know what it's like to live
in the dark and hide in another world.

919
01:33:48,336 --> 01:33:54,384
A world full of silence,
getting used to measuring your steps.

920
01:33:55,176 --> 01:33:58,263
Always wearing
the appropriate clothes.

921
01:33:58,430 --> 01:34:01,599
Making your voice one voice and none.

922
01:34:01,766 --> 01:34:05,562
And your eyes, two eyes and none.

923
01:34:05,729 --> 01:34:09,774
lt takes so long that eventually
you become a shadow.

924
01:34:09,941 --> 01:34:14,237
But one day you find out that
blind girls realise that you're there,

925
01:34:14,404 --> 01:34:18,450
that you're breathing,
that you are still alive.

926
01:34:18,616 --> 01:34:24,205
That you can offer them your eyes
for theirs, your hands for theirs...

927
01:34:24,622 --> 01:34:27,667
That's why our relationship
is so perfect.

928
01:34:28,585 --> 01:34:29,627
That's why...

929
01:34:30,795 --> 01:34:32,922
...we have to continue this way.

930
01:34:38,428 --> 01:34:41,014
lf you are not lvan, who are you?

931
01:34:41,848 --> 01:34:43,850
Where are you taking me?

932
01:34:44,893 --> 01:34:47,479
My eyes hurt.
Something is wrong.

933
01:34:48,104 --> 01:34:50,774
Take the bandage off, please.

934
01:34:51,608 --> 01:34:53,401
Please.

935
01:34:54,361 --> 01:34:56,196
Please, take it off.

936
01:34:56,404 --> 01:34:59,699
Please, my eyes hurt.
Take the bandage off.

937
01:34:59,866 --> 01:35:01,743
Shut up!

938
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:05,914
l beg you.

939
01:35:20,804 --> 01:35:22,180
Let me see.

940
01:35:23,473 --> 01:35:25,600
Let me see.

941
01:35:29,145 --> 01:35:32,107
lt's started again, right?

942
01:35:38,405 --> 01:35:40,407
This time...

943
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,618
...it will be more intense.

944
01:35:58,383 --> 01:36:01,469
Get out of the car.
You have to pack your bags.

945
01:36:03,596 --> 01:36:04,931
Open the door, Julia.

946
01:36:09,936 --> 01:36:13,940
Open the fucking door!
Open the door!

947
01:36:14,774 --> 01:36:17,068
Open the fucking door!

948
01:36:17,485 --> 01:36:19,112
Julia!

949
01:36:19,237 --> 01:36:20,905
Julia!

950
01:36:21,072 --> 01:36:22,782
Julia!

951
01:36:26,703 --> 01:36:28,621
Julia!

952
01:37:46,449 --> 01:37:48,618
Who's there?

953
01:37:48,785 --> 01:37:51,037
ls the main door locked?

954
01:37:51,204 --> 01:37:54,249
- ls that you, Julia? You scared me.
- ls it locked?

955
01:37:54,416 --> 01:37:57,168
Yes, of course.
What's wrong?

956
01:37:57,293 --> 01:38:00,005
- There's a murderer in the area.
- A murderer?

957
01:38:00,171 --> 01:38:02,424
We have to call the police.
Where's the phone?

958
01:38:02,549 --> 01:38:06,886
There, in the corner.
Under the painting.

959
01:38:07,053 --> 01:38:09,014
Don't move.

960
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:11,016
Be quiet.

961
01:38:11,558 --> 01:38:13,309
- What's wrong?
- Don't move.

962
01:38:20,316 --> 01:38:23,278
- lt's him. He's here.
- Who?

963
01:38:23,987 --> 01:38:26,448
Don't come any closer,
you son of a bitch.

964
01:38:26,573 --> 01:38:30,368
- Who are you talking to?
- To a man who thinks he's invisible.

965
01:38:30,535 --> 01:38:33,663
He made Sara go blind
and he wants to do the same to me.

966
01:38:34,122 --> 01:38:37,417
- You're scaring me.
- Stay away.

967
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:39,586
Soledad, call the police.

968
01:38:39,753 --> 01:38:42,630
- Oall the police, quick!
- Don't do it, Mum.

969
01:38:44,174 --> 01:38:45,884
Ángel...

970
01:38:46,551 --> 01:38:48,386
ls that you, son?

971
01:38:51,556 --> 01:38:53,141
Yes.

972
01:38:53,308 --> 01:38:54,893
l'm back home.

973
01:38:55,643 --> 01:38:58,396
This woman says you're chasing her.

974
01:38:58,563 --> 01:39:00,482
This woman is crazy.

975
01:39:02,734 --> 01:39:05,904
- Your son is a murderer.
- Shut up. Don't listen to her, Mum.

976
01:39:06,071 --> 01:39:07,864
- He killed my husband.
- She's lying.

977
01:39:08,031 --> 01:39:10,700
- He killed my husband and Sara too.
- Shut up.

978
01:39:10,909 --> 01:39:14,704
- lt must have been easy to hang her.
- l loved Sara.

979
01:39:15,497 --> 01:39:18,583
She killed herself because she wasn't
capable of living in darkness.

980
01:39:18,708 --> 01:39:20,543
Oapable?

981
01:39:20,669 --> 01:39:24,714
No one is capable of getting used to it.
You made her go blind.

982
01:39:24,839 --> 01:39:25,965
You killed her.

983
01:39:26,132 --> 01:39:30,512
- ls that true, son?
- Mum, mum. You know me.

984
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,515
l said don't move.

985
01:39:33,723 --> 01:39:36,976
Make the call. Make it.

986
01:40:03,586 --> 01:40:06,047
l knew you'd come back.

987
01:40:07,549 --> 01:40:11,720
l knew you'd realise
that you can only be happy here.

988
01:40:12,303 --> 01:40:15,432
l told you that without me,
you'd be nothing.

989
01:40:15,598 --> 01:40:17,892
Less than nothing.

990
01:40:18,018 --> 01:40:20,103
lnvisible.

991
01:40:27,694 --> 01:40:29,487
Since when can you see, Mum?

992
01:40:29,612 --> 01:40:34,701
But you're still my son, and l won't let
anybody take you away from me.

993
01:40:34,868 --> 01:40:37,829
Mum, l asked you a question.

994
01:40:39,122 --> 01:40:42,834
Since when can you see?

995
01:40:43,001 --> 01:40:46,588
Ángel, what are you doing, son?

996
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:50,633
What are you doing, son? No, no.

997
01:40:51,217 --> 01:40:53,470
No, no.

998
01:40:54,721 --> 01:40:56,014
Oalm down, Mum.

999
01:41:00,185 --> 01:41:02,228
- lt's me.
- Mum, calm down.

1000
01:41:03,146 --> 01:41:09,402
Look, Mum, this liquid attacks the optic
nerve without causing any pain.

1001
01:41:09,569 --> 01:41:14,491
Don't worry.
And these needles are very useful too.

1002
01:41:14,657 --> 01:41:18,745
- Don't do it, please.
- Mum, l have to do it.

1003
01:41:19,287 --> 01:41:21,748
- Oh, my boy!
- Don't worry.

1004
01:41:53,571 --> 01:41:54,989
What are we doing here?

1005
01:41:58,410 --> 01:42:00,745
l won't use it on you.

1006
01:42:05,709 --> 01:42:10,714
Your optic nerve must be very damaged
by now. lt won't take long.

1007
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:16,511
- This can't end like this.
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

1008
01:42:16,678 --> 01:42:22,767
Don't worry. When the darkness comes,
l'll be by your side.

1009
01:42:23,685 --> 01:42:25,979
l've packed your bags.

1010
01:42:26,146 --> 01:42:30,442
We will go far away
and nobody will find us.

1011
01:42:31,276 --> 01:42:32,819
We will start from scratch.

1012
01:42:32,986 --> 01:42:34,612
Don't touch me!

1013
01:42:35,488 --> 01:42:37,365
Don't touch me, son of a bitch.

1014
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:41,119
l will never love you. Never.

1015
01:42:41,286 --> 01:42:42,996
l would die first.

1016
01:42:44,122 --> 01:42:45,874
- Don't touch me!
- ls that what you want?

1017
01:42:46,041 --> 01:42:48,960
Don't touch me!

1018
01:42:50,045 --> 01:42:52,547
Let go of me!

1019
01:42:52,714 --> 01:42:56,051
- Let go of me!
- Oome on, do it!

1020
01:42:58,595 --> 01:43:00,388
Stay with me.

1021
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,756
Do it. Do it.

1022
01:43:35,298 --> 01:43:38,134
Do it! Do it!

1023
01:43:38,259 --> 01:43:41,304
- Do it.
- l can't! l can't!

1024
01:43:46,559 --> 01:43:47,977
Of course you can't.

1025
01:43:48,186 --> 01:43:51,773
Although you don't know it...
you love me.

1026
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:56,027
Because you know that without me,
you are nothing.

1027
01:43:56,194 --> 01:43:58,738
And l am only a shadow without you.

1028
01:45:14,105 --> 01:45:16,608
Julia, why did you lock the door?

1029
01:45:20,779 --> 01:45:22,739
- HeIIo?
- lnspector. lt's Julia.

1030
01:45:22,906 --> 01:45:23,948
JuIia, it's you.

1031
01:45:24,157 --> 01:45:27,827
Listen to me, because this is
the last time l'll call you.

1032
01:45:27,994 --> 01:45:31,706
- CaIm down.
- He's locked me in my house.

1033
01:45:31,873 --> 01:45:34,042
- CaIm down, JuIia.
- He's going to kill me.

1034
01:45:34,209 --> 01:45:38,588
lf you don't come, it will be too late.
You have to believe me. Please.

1035
01:45:38,797 --> 01:45:41,216
- JuIia, pIease, caIm down.
- Are you listening to me?

1036
01:45:43,343 --> 01:45:44,803
lnspector?

1037
01:45:51,726 --> 01:45:53,061
Julia!

1038
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1039
01:47:58,186 --> 01:48:01,147
Julia, police!
Oover the stairs and the hallway.

1040
01:48:01,314 --> 01:48:03,149
Julia, are you there?

1041
01:48:03,316 --> 01:48:06,194
lt's Dimas. Oan you hear me?

1042
01:48:06,903 --> 01:48:08,947
- Julia, what are you doing?
- Shut up!

1043
01:48:09,114 --> 01:48:12,033
- What's going on?
- l said shut up!

1044
