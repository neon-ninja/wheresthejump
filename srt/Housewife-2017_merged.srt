1
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,767
Stop that humming, will you?

2
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,708
- Can I enter?
- No.

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,684
What did you draw again?

4
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,291
I don't know.

5
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,601
Hmm.

6
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,416
Is Mummy with the
visitors again?

7
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,851
Why can't we ever
see the visitors?

8
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,851
Because only Mother
talks to the visitors.

9
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,309
But why only visitors come
when Dad is not home?

10
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,517
I'll tell Dad.

11
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,517
No! She will punish us.

12
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,434
Don't you dare.

13
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,059
What happened to you?

14
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,517
- I'll tell Mother.
- No!

15
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,416
Mama!

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Mummy!

17
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,642
Okay. Don't worry.

18
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,767
She is simply here.

19
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,875
It's going to be okay.

20
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,666
What is it?

21
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,750
Oh, my.

22
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,666
Oh, no.

23
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,809
No.

24
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,434
No! No!

25
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,208
No.

26
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,684
No. No.

27
00:02:58,708 --> 00:02:59,976
No.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,809
Mother, have the visitors left?

29
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,458
Yes.

30
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,833
Yes. They're gone.

31
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:20,434
Now, Holly... my sweet child...

32
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:24,267
we're going to
play a game, okay?

33
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,559
You're going to stay here...

34
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:33,267
and shut your eyes
and count to 100.

35
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,642
And if you finish counting,

36
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,083
you're going to
start again, okay?

37
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,333
Now, shut your eyes.

38
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,333
- Okay.
- One. Two.

39
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,559
Eleven. Twelve.

40
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,642
Thirteen. Fourteen.

41
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,791
Fifteen. Sixteen.

42
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,833
Mother?

43
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,458
Mother?

44
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,642
Mother?

45
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,000
Hazel?

46
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,892
Holly!

47
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,541
Holly!

48
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:26,666
Visitors, begone!

49
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

50
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,101
Holly!

51
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,392
Holly?

52
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,309
Forgive me.

53
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,142
I have to do this.

54
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,500
I have no choice.

55
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,791
I'm so sorry.

56
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,601
Mummy!

57
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,059
No. Don't.

58
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,476
Holly!

59
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,809
Come back! Holly!

60
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,309
Holly!

61
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,434
Come back!

62
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,517
Hey.

63
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,351
Hey, baby. Thank you.

64
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,208
You're welcome.

65
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:06,684
So you're still looking for
the cover of your book?

66
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,583
Yeah.

67
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,017
I mean, I did a couple
of things last night,

68
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:15,000
but... they weren't right.

69
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:19,892
You know, when I worked on your
story and wrote about you,

70
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,267
you know, the cover
came from the heart.

71
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,184
It just flowed. It was natural.

72
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,809
It felt right.

73
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,916
No advice, no
agents, no nothing.

74
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,750
What do you think of this one?

75
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,351
Um, well, it's...

76
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,809
it's dark and depressing.

77
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,892
Oh, of course.

78
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,934
But, I mean, it's...
it's beautiful.

79
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,684
Well, I'm still working.

80
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,309
No. It's beautiful.

81
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,142
I'm gonna take these with me.

82
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,517
Mm-hmm.

83
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,601
And, uh, I'll eat
them on my way.

84
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,767
Okay.

85
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,892
Thank you, sweetie.

86
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,375
- Good luck.
- Thank you, baby.

87
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,267
Dear friends...
our only friends,

88
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,017
thank you for being here with us

89
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,166
on the third anniversary
of our wedding.

90
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,267
What?

91
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,750
What?

92
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,625
Holly and I...

93
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,767
decided to have a baby.

94
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,226
- Whoa!
- Yes.

95
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,934
- Okay. Yes. All right.
- Bring 'em home!

96
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,601
Yes. Cheers to that.

97
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,601
- Yeah.
- Well done, guys.

98
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,375
Congratulations.

99
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,642
Uh, I just wrote an...
An article

100
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:28,351
on this, uh, crazy
world-famous cult

101
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,392
that actually believes in
the apocalypse happening

102
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,851
pretty soon.

103
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,601
It's like Scientology
with astral travel.

104
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,934
ULM?

105
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,517
Umbrella of Love and Mind.
That's the one. Yeah.

106
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,892
- Do you know them, too?
- Have you heard of it?

107
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:42,767
Bruce O'Hara, I mean,
he's a rock star.

108
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,892
Yeah. And they're
in town, actually.

109
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,767
Uh, and they're having their
gathering tomorrow night.

110
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,267
And believe it or not, we're
gonna go check it out.

111
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,559
Yep.

112
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,851
Yeah.

113
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:58,392
Well... we actually had a
friend back in New York

114
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,392
who later on became
a ULM disciple.

115
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,934
- Oh.
- Yeah.

116
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,934
She was, like, Tim's special
buddy, and we became friends.

117
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,017
Best friends.

118
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,267
Come on. She was not
my best friend.

119
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,309
We just became friends,
and it's that in the end,

120
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,642
we ended up living together
in New York and...

121
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,476
You know, I-I sort of remember
her, like, from New York.

122
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,142
- The curly-haired, folksy girl.
- Yeah.

123
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,601
What was her name? Valerie.

124
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,267
Yeah, yeah. Valerie. I remember.

125
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,017
Yeah. Anyway, she...

126
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,351
Like two years ago,
she just disappeared.

127
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,226
I mean, we haven't
heard from her since.

128
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,559
- She just...
- Wait. Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

129
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,892
- What do you mean, disappeared?
- Well, she...

130
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,142
I think that she's
touring with ULM

131
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,809
and she's following them,
whatever they're doing.

132
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,017
Anyway...

133
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,517
But if she's part of ULM,

134
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,892
she might be at this
gathering tomorrow night.

135
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,601
We're going. Maybe
we'll meet her.

136
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,976
You guys should come, too.

137
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,851
- Why don't you? Yeah.
- I don't know, man.

138
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Um, I don't think it's
a good idea, but...
These things are pretty fun.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

139
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,392
Go away! Go away!

140
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:35,791
Don't worry, Holly. It's me...
Valerie.

141
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,000
Why did you disappear?

142
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,767
I mean... I know why
you disappeared,

143
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,851
but... why didn't
you send a message

144
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:58,726
or... even call us?

145
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,125
I had no other choice.

146
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:05,375
You always have a choice.

147
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:11,625
I guess it was how
it's meant to be.

148
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,000
And I came here for
a bigger reason.

149
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,934
Why are you laughing?

150
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,916
I missed you.

151
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,309
I missed you, too.

152
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,125
Come on.

153
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,625
Come on. Oh.

154
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Look what I found.

155
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,476
Do you remember that day?

156
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,041
How can I forget?

157
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,041
Yeah.

158
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,250
I know.

159
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,267
I know.

160
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:58,726
And now the universe
brought us back together.

161
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,767
- Oh, the universe?
- The universe.

162
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,726
Always the universe.

163
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,434
Hello.

164
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:09,559
Uh, hey.

165
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,684
Hey, Valerie.

166
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:13,601
It's been a long time.

167
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,601
Uh, what are you doing here?

168
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,142
How did you find us?

169
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,142
Maybe I should have called,
but can you let me in?

170
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,476
Yeah, yeah. Come in.

171
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,684
It's been a long time.

172
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,642
Bring it in!

173
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,267
Where's Holly?

174
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,517
Oh, she's sleeping.

175
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,226
She's, uh, she's in there.

176
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,101
- Go on. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

177
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,625
Holly?

178
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,791
Valerie.

179
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,309
Where's my girl?

180
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:57,809
Whoo!

181
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,309
Oh.

182
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,916
Mm!

183
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:07,541
Oh, you smell exactly the same.

184
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,267
Isn't it great how the
universe brought us here,

185
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:16,559
back together again?

186
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,601
Universe? Is that
what you call it?

187
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:21,184
Well, I know. I'm sorry.

188
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:24,767
I should have called somehow,
and I should have let you know.

189
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:28,184
I think it was perhaps
a very abrupt way...

190
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:30,059
- Yeah, it was.
- To leave.

191
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,642
But, you know, I've been
completely disconnected

192
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,684
from everything and everyone.

193
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:37,875
I had to come here in person.

194
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,851
And I'm here to apologize.

195
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:44,184
Is that why you came?
To apologize?

196
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:48,101
That and ULM is in town tonight.

197
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,517
Yeah.

198
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:56,416
Well... I came here to take
you to tonight's seminar.

199
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:01,059
Yeah. I know this. A
friend of mine wrote it.

200
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:03,226
Oh. Well, is he coming tonight?

201
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,101
No idea.

202
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,434
Well, okay.

203
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,934
So... look, Holly.

204
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:12,476
I know that it's very
difficult to put into words

205
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,767
what I've been through
for the past two years.

206
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:22,101
But I-I need you to come
to tonight's seminar,

207
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:24,851
that if you just
give me a chance...

208
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,642
Just come tonight.

209
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,642
Please.

210
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:31,041
Okay.

211
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:35,142
Okay. Let's see what's
the big deal about ULM.

212
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:38,583
I mean, if that's what you need.

213
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:41,708
Yeah.

214
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,226
Oh, this is gonna be great.

215
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,726
Okay. It's a date.

216
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,976
- It's a date.
- It's a date.

217
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,142
Can I have your name, please?

218
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:23,017
Yes. Uh, Valerie plus
two from family.

219
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,559
Oh. Of course.

220
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,791
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

221
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:29,101
Who pays for all this, Val?

222
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,041
Bruce O'Hara Fund.

223
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,809
Come. Join me.

224
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,559
It's beautiful.

225
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:37,809
Yeah.

226
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,351
You want a drink or
anything, sweetie?

227
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,833
No, thank you. I'm fine.

228
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:50,392
Oh, look. They're here.

229
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:52,226
Oh! Oh, hi.

230
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,017
How about that? This is great.

231
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,559
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, you made it.

232
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:56,976
Glad to see you.

233
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,309
- This is Valerie.
- Oh, this is great.

234
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:00,392
Oh, hi, Valerie.
Nice to meet you.

235
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:02,476
Nice to meet you, too.

236
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,476
The pleasure is ours.

237
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,101
Oh, my.

238
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,601
I can't believe I'm saying this,

239
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:10,476
but it's really an honor to
meet someone from the family.

240
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,059
There are gonna be other
family members here, right?

241
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:14,226
- Yes, there are.
- This is great.

242
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,184
Holly, why don't I show
you to the bathroom?

243
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:18,642
Yeah.

244
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,851
I'm gonna go get ready, and
I'll see you guys inside.

245
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:23,333
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

246
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:51,541
- You done?
- Yeah.

247
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,684
- Crazy pictures...
- Yeah?

248
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:16,291
Inside this.

249
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:19,142
Is this your first time?

250
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,601
- Yeah.
- Ah.

251
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,226
- Yours?
- Yes.

252
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,392
You're lucky.

253
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,309
I came all the way
from Morocco for this,

254
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,184
uh, with, uh, with the wife.

255
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,976
- Morocco?
- Morocco.

256
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,309
Wow.

257
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,642
My wife, uh, she's gonna
be in the family soon.

258
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,351
Lucky you, man.

259
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:38,976
She's been, uh, dream-training
for, uh, 14 months for this.

260
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,851
She's becoming quite the pro.

261
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,101
Dream training?

262
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,476
Dream training. Yes.

263
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,351
Some mornings, she
wakes up, uh, totally,

264
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:50,958
like, all wet and
stuff down there.

265
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,684
Crazy.

266
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,892
Crazy.

267
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,017
What? Did he see you?

268
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:17,101
- I don't know.
- Okay.

269
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:20,351
You go find him and
I'll meet the family

270
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,892
and I'll see you inside, okay?

271
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:23,875
- Okay.
- All right.

272
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:52,916
I have a feeling that this
place is going to go crazy.

273
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,351
It's packed.

274
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,809
Yeah.

275
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:58,642
It's beautiful here.

276
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,434
Ladies and gentlemen,

277
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:09,226
please welcome...
the family members!

278
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,767
Why do we dream?

279
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,434
How do we dream?

280
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:51,101
Here in Umbrella
of Love and Mind,

281
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:57,142
we believe many of those answers
lie where we may know the least.

282
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:03,017
The sacred time is near,
and here in our family,

283
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:07,392
we have found the savior
to guide us in our dreams,

284
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:09,642
to our destiny.

285
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:13,541
Maybe tonight it's your turn.

286
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,934
The time has come!

287
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,267
He's here!

288
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:31,059
He is... Bruce O'Hara!

289
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:26,101
We are trapped...

290
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:31,142
Inside our own
heads, our memories.

291
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,541
We're components in the system.

292
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,809
Here in Umbrella
of Love and Mind,

293
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,684
we're not supernatural,
as some claim.

294
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,333
No.

295
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,767
We're naturally super.

296
00:33:56,291 --> 00:34:01,351
We're visitors, visitors
outside of our walls,

297
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,601
inside others' walls, past
others' minds' walls.

298
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:09,833
And beyond those walls,
we know that we are one.

299
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:16,934
Tonight I want to begin
with those who doubt us.

300
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:20,791
What does it mean
being a dream surfer?

301
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:24,809
It wasn't an easy
thing to discover,

302
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:29,017
being able to know
about people's minds,

303
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:32,517
their lives, their secrets.

304
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:40,017
You see, when I touch them...

305
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:45,958
I can see their needs... their souls...
everything.

306
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:52,125
Last night, I had a
vessel dream again.

307
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:57,351
This time, it was about
a very important woman

308
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,541
who's about to enter my life.

309
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,291
Yes.

310
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:16,750
I must see you tonight.

311
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:21,666
I can feel the
vibration in the room.

312
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,625
She is here.

313
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:33,000
She's the soul mate... of a
new member of our family.

314
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,500
So it's you.

315
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,625
Welcome.

316
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,726
May I, please?

317
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,726
Oh.

318
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,184
- No.
- I...

319
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:52,851
Don't be afraid.

320
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,642
Fear, my friends,
is our addiction.

321
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:58,142
It's our drug.

322
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:02,392
It enslaves us, feeds on us.

323
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:05,392
I used to be a slave
to my own fears,

324
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:10,934
but through studying my
dreams and visiting others,

325
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,833
I am healed now.

326
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:15,250
I'm free.

327
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:22,375
I strongly feel that...
you need healing, too.

328
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,416
Am I right?

329
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,309
It's okay. It's okay.

330
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:33,351
No. I-I'm not sure I'm the right
person to do it in front...

331
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,083
- Oh!
- Oh!

332
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:40,892
Please.

333
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:45,041
Holly... give me your hand.

334
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:09,351
It's her.

335
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,166
It's you.

336
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,059
Just breathe... and
open your mind.

337
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:39,434
Why can't we ever
see the visitors?

338
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:42,101
Because only Mother
talks to the visitors.

339
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:46,142
But why only visitors come
when Dad is not home?

340
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:22,291
What am...

341
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,767
Oh, my God.

342
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:28,750
How is this possible?

343
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,184
No.

344
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,208
No.

345
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,125
This is Bruce
O'Hara's show, right?

346
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:22,809
You okay?

347
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:24,809
I'm fine.

348
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,184
He knows me.

349
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:27,875
He knows me.

350
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:44,125
Great.

351
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:49,226
Great. Exactly what we needed.

352
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,059
Dream surfer, my ass.

353
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:54,267
Let me tell you this... That
dude is a fucking con man.

354
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:57,559
He was bleeding, Tim. Come on.

355
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:58,875
So?

356
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:05,708
That was a fucking weird
hypnosis or something.

357
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:09,642
He tried to fuck
with my wife's mind.

358
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:13,226
That dude, oh, I give it to him.

359
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,809
But he's a con man.

360
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,351
I've never seen
anything like it,

361
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:19,434
and, no, he's not a con man.

362
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:22,392
Wake up. Wake up.

363
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:24,976
Akasha frequencies and
astral projections,

364
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,976
I know this shit.
The dude is fake.

365
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,476
How do you explain what
happened to her, then?

366
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,726
Because since you
know everything...

367
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,458
Are you two seriously arguing?

368
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:37,476
Actually, it's quite nostalgic

369
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,601
hearing you two argue
like the good old days

370
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:47,767
when we were in our
little house in New York.

371
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:50,267
How do you explain what
happened to her, then, huh?

372
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:52,809
I can't. But I'll find out.

373
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:55,291
What's happening with you two?

374
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,184
I'm telling you, I feel great.

375
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:03,041
I feel great.

376
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:06,625
- Sweetie...
- Hmm?

377
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,583
Do you want to tell me
what happened tonight?

378
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:13,476
Well, I don't know what it was,

379
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,976
but it's just as if he
was in my head or...

380
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,267
Or in my fears, maybe.

381
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:24,226
I mean, I don't know, but I
feel so much better now.

382
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,017
- I don't understand.
- Okay. Um...

383
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,375
I have to confess something.

384
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:35,684
When you told me that you
wanted to have a baby,

385
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:37,767
I said okay, but I lied.

386
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:41,767
I mean, I wasn't ready.

387
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,875
I was afraid of it.

388
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:52,517
Oh, Holly, come on.

389
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:54,184
Why?

390
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,601
I don't know.

391
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:57,309
- Oh, Holly.
- I was scared.

392
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:58,892
I'm sorry, Tim.

393
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:03,476
I'm sorry, but I am ready now,

394
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,851
and I think that Bruce
cured my fears,

395
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:11,517
and I'm ready to have
this baby now, tonight.

396
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:13,267
Why didn't you tell me, huh?

397
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,642
How long you were planning
to go along with it?

398
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:18,625
I don't know, and I'm so sorry.
I am.

399
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:23,125
I'm...

400
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:26,666
I understand, okay?

401
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:29,267
I wish you said something,

402
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:34,851
but I want to understand what's
going on with you, okay?

403
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:35,892
I want to know.

404
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:39,226
So just for one...
One small second,

405
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,934
if you can be, like,
normal and tell me...

406
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:43,767
Okay, no, I don't know what happened.
Why don't you tell me?

407
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:48,083
Actually, why don't you
write a book about it, huh?

408
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:55,851
- What did he do to her, Val?
- I don't think she knows either.

409
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:57,351
I don't think she experienced

410
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,309
something like this
with him before.

411
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:02,184
Oh, come on, sweetheart.
How would you know?

412
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:05,309
- I'm a family member.
- Tell us. Go ahead.

413
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:06,791
Okay.

414
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:10,476
Well, when you enter
his frequency,

415
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,517
there is complete
and utter surrender

416
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:14,309
in which fear materializes.

417
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:15,767
Are you jealous, Val?

418
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:18,309
- No!
- Okay, good.

419
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:20,142
Because that would be
completely unfair.

420
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:23,434
I mean, coming here after
two years of silence

421
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:25,392
when we shared
everything with you.

422
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:27,976
We shared our home with you.
We shared our bed with you.

423
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,934
- I shared my husband with you.
- Oh, come on, Holly.

424
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,267
Then you have the nerve

425
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:34,726
to be jealous of your
new boyfriend and me,

426
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,517
of your new family and me?

427
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,184
I said I'm not jealous, okay?

428
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,351
Okay. Okay.

429
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,351
Sorry. I'm sorry.

430
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:45,500
Look, I'm here, okay?

431
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:49,000
Here with you.

432
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,000
Just wanted to help you.

433
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:56,166
Then help me.

434
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,833
Help me.

435
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:39,958
What is it?

436
00:46:48,791 --> 00:46:51,726
Go on, baby. Don't stop now.

437
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,601
I'm... I'm...

438
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,791
Oh, yeah.

439
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

440
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,958
Hey! Hey, who are you?

441
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

442
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:20,750
Holly!

443
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:25,267
Holly, what is it?

444
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:26,309
What is it, sweetheart?

445
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,934
She's here! She's here!
I saw her!

446
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,434
- She's here!
- Who? Your mother?

447
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:31,500
Yeah! She's in there!

448
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:34,208
- Oh, my God!
- Who's in there?!

449
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,517
- Okay, calm...
- Where's my amulet?

450
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:38,642
What?

451
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:40,434
- She took my amulet!
- No!

452
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:41,726
- Baby...
- My mom!

453
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,476
- Nobody is inside.
- No, she's inside.

454
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,226
- Baby...
- I saw her!

455
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,601
I saw her! She was there.

456
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:49,105
Baby, there is no one inside.

457
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:04,351
Hey. You'll get cold.

458
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:06,726
I'll be okay.

459
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,559
I looked for the
amulet everywhere.

460
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:11,309
Look at all that junk. It's
definitely not in there.

461
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,809
It's probably somewhere
in the house.

462
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:15,250
Yeah.

463
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,250
What happened last night, Val?

464
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:33,125
And we're back.

465
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,226
What are you doing to me?

466
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:40,392
- You're doing it.
- No.

467
00:54:40,416 --> 00:54:45,226
This is an initiation.
We go where you take us.

468
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,434
But I don't want to
take you anywhere.

469
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:49,642
No, you do.

470
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:52,583
You're stronger
than your mother.

471
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,125
- But I...
- Please.

472
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:00,500
Let me take you to your destiny.

473
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:06,017
May I?

474
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:08,083
Will you be bleeding
all over again?

475
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:11,958
Just breathe.

476
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:29,875
Here we go.

477
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:42,458
Let's go back to
where it all began.

478
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:49,583
Don't be afraid, Holly.
I'm here with you.

479
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:52,000
Just breathe.

480
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:40,333
Mother?

481
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:03,166
Mother?

482
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:41,101
Oh, no!

483
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:44,833
Visitors, begone!

484
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:15,934
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Hazel.

485
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:18,101
- We're back. We... We're back.
- No! You're a liar!

486
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:19,726
You're a liar!

487
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,601
You're crazy!

488
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:24,184
- Get out of my mind!
- You had to see it.

489
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:26,767
Get out of my mind! I
didn't kill my sister!

490
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:29,351
You had to see it.

491
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:31,601
- You can't leave now.
- You're crazy.

492
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:33,892
You're crazy, and you're a liar!

493
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:36,976
I didn't kill my sister!

494
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,309
Remember how you came here.

495
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:42,142
I invited you here.

496
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:45,142
If you leave me now, even
I can't help you, Holly.

497
00:58:45,166 --> 00:58:47,642
You don't know where
you'll end up.

498
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:50,333
You might forever be trapped
in a maze of dreams, Holly!

499
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:24,833
She doesn't even know if
it's her dream or not.

500
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:30,333
I'm not sure she's
the master visitor.

501
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:35,833
Trust me.

502
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:41,851
She's the one. Go to her now.

503
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:46,791
It's your turn. She is
the master visitor.

504
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:54,601
I'll do my part.

505
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,666
I've been ready for
this all my life.

506
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,601
Tim?

507
01:00:01,625 --> 01:00:03,083
Val?

508
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:06,666
Tim?!

509
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:32,375
Hazel.

510
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:34,517
You're okay.

511
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:38,851
Hazel? Hazel, you're okay!

512
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hey.

513
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:50,184
It's okay. It's me.

514
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:51,892
Did you go see Bruce?

515
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:59,267
What the fuck is going on, huh?

516
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:01,517
What are you trying
to do to her?

517
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:04,208
Hey. No, Tim!

518
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:07,976
Holly!

519
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Holly!

520
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:16,583
Holly!

521
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,916
I have to abort
your journey, Val.

522
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:05,833
You're scaring her.

523
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:09,916
You're scaring me too.

524
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:24,476
I told you you'd get lost.
Didn't I?

525
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,875
Yeah.

526
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:30,267
Ah.

527
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:32,000
Where are you now?

528
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,517
In a dream again?

529
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:37,875
- I don't know.
- No.

530
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:42,041
You're lost in a maze now.

531
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:46,625
I'm you're only
chance to get out.

532
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:52,416
You have to go all the way
to the end of the tunnel.

533
01:02:53,375 --> 01:02:55,916
You can't stop here.

534
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:02,833
Accept the mystery.

535
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,958
What the fuck?

536
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:31,809
Holly?

537
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:33,851
Valerie, are you okay?

538
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:37,351
This is how you repay my trust?

539
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:39,291
Please don't hurt him.

540
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:44,291
We're in a family meeting, Tim.

541
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:47,976
You can't be here.

542
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,226
I'm gonna fucking
take your head off.

543
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:56,351
But I love her!

544
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,017
No, you don't, Tim.

545
01:03:58,041 --> 01:04:00,291
You're just a bad actor.

546
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:05,142
Trust me.

547
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:06,583
Let go.

548
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,976
Who are they?

549
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,517
They are my children.

550
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:27,791
They're born visitors.

551
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:31,250
Holly, this is not real.

552
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:35,851
Bruce. Bruce, please,
don't do this.

553
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:38,142
What are you doing?

554
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:43,000
Please, please, Bruce. You
don't have to do this.

555
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:47,791
Bruce, you don't
have to do this.

556
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:53,166
It's... It's all my fault.

557
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:57,351
Bruce!

558
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:59,226
I wanted you to be
a part of this.

559
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:02,267
I trusted you!

560
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,625
This is Holly's dream, hmm?

561
01:06:05,916 --> 01:06:08,351
And when will I see her again?

562
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:10,208
No.

563
01:06:11,708 --> 01:06:13,351
Time to wake up.

564
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:17,184
Make it quick, you bastard!

565
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:23,017
Val! No!

566
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:42,833
No!

567
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:01,059
Val!

568
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,226
No!

569
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:12,375
Shhhhh.

570
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:17,767
It's okay. It's okay.

571
01:07:17,791 --> 01:07:19,934
What's happening?

572
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:21,767
- What's happening?
- I know. I know.

573
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:24,250
What's happening?

574
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:30,250
I can imagine how
crazy this must seem.

575
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:36,017
But sometimes things just are.

576
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:38,184
You're ready.

577
01:07:38,208 --> 01:07:40,559
Ready to embrace
your new family.

578
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,309
The master is here.

579
01:07:55,833 --> 01:07:58,791
You all have been waiting
for this night for so long.

580
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:44,351
Hazel.

581
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:48,142
Hazel, is that you?

582
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,666
Is that you?

583
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:01,559
My dear queen,

584
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:03,517
you are ready to rise

585
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:05,208
as the mother of
the second coming.

586
01:09:38,083 --> 01:09:40,851
Finally together.

587
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:44,059
We are ready to go.

588
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:45,958
Are you ready to go?

589
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:50,958
No! No! No!

590
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:09,083
We are all your servants now.

591
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,750
Oh!

592
01:15:36,958 --> 01:15:39,250
Only the next of kin.

593
01:21:16,166 --> 01:21:20,392
He is Bruce O'Hara!
