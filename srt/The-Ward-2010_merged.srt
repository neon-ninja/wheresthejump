1
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:04,654
All units, be on the lookout
for a missing person.

2
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:07,664
Female, 18, about 5'7".

3
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,624
Last seen wearing a white dress.

4
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:13,037
She is considered unstable
and possibly dangerous.

5
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,896
What the hell?
Must be that girl.

6
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,587
Come on.

7
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,551
Alright, little girl...
No! Get your...!

8
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:53,263
Get off me! No! No! No!
Careful.

9
00:06:53,298 --> 00:06:55,887
Get her in!
No! No! No!

10
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:58,476
No! No!
Sweetheart, behave.

11
00:06:58,511 --> 00:07:00,485
No! No!

12
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,480
You're going...
Watch her head.

13
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:04,440
Get the door.
Watch her head.

14
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:06,491
No!
Cuff her.

15
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,570
Get off me! No!
Get the cuffs on her.

16
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:12,657
No! Get off! Let me go!

17
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:15,118
Let me go!

18
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:03,291
What's your name?

19
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,794
Kristen.

20
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,893
She belongs in jail,
not here.

21
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:18,681
They're taking her to
the ward. She can't hurt anyone there.

22
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,282
I'm Roy.

23
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:32,278
Welcome to paradise.

24
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:47,981
So, I can be your buddy
or I can be a thorn in your side.

25
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:52,090
It all depends on whether
you're willing to follow the rules.

26
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:00,265
Come to visit me.

27
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,489
This is the ward, your new home.

28
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:21,244
Come on.

29
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:41,806
OK. Kristen, huh?

30
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:48,771
Alright, come with me.

31
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:56,070
You're free to use the recreation room
and the courtyard

32
00:09:56,105 --> 00:09:58,163
any time 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.

33
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,868
But at night we're locked down
and you'll be confined to your room.

34
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,222
This will be your room.

35
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:33,399
Get some rest.

36
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:23,475
Kristen?

37
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,012
Most patients prefer the bed.

38
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,897
I'm Dr. Gerald Stringer.

39
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:31,267
I'll be treating you
while you're here.

40
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:34,437
Good morning. How did you sleep?

41
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:39,275
Who came in here last night?
What do you mean?

42
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,361
Somebody came in here
and hid my blanket.

43
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,656
The door was locked all night,
wasn't it, Nurse?

44
00:12:44,691 --> 00:12:46,324
Yes, Doctor, always.

45
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:50,995
Here, take these.

46
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:54,380
No.

47
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:56,292
It's not a request.

48
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:04,843
What are they?
Something to help you get better.

49
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,068
You're right... I feel better already.

50
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:17,856
You'd do well to follow the rules
around here, young lady.

51
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:19,858
That'll be all for now,
Nurse Lundt.

52
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:22,443
Yes, Doctor.

53
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,079
Why am I here?

54
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:28,700
That's the $64,000 question.

55
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,643
I am ready.

56
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:51,681
Are you a member
of the theatrical profession?

57
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:53,308
Yes.

58
00:13:59,147 --> 00:14:02,191
Who's the new girl?
Some runaway.

59
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:05,236
Let's see how long this one lasts.

60
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,334
Who are you?
I'm no one.

61
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:16,831
Well, why are you here?
I'm not. I'm leaving.

62
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,416
Are you gonna save us?

63
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:22,469
From what?

64
00:14:22,504 --> 00:14:25,763
Whoo-hoo-hoo.
Come on, Emily, knock it off.

65
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,134
Let's not scare off the new girl
on her first day.

66
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,971
Hi.

67
00:14:33,848 --> 00:14:35,648
My name's Iris.

68
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:39,061
It's Kristen, right?
I saw your name on the door.

69
00:14:39,096 --> 00:14:42,440
Looks like Iris has herself
a new girlfriend.

70
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:44,741
Jealous?
Please.

71
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:46,319
Don't make me throw up.

72
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,535
You two are disgusting.

73
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,289
Looks like it's time
to see the doctor.

74
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:00,917
Right this way.

75
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:07,013
How are you feeling?

76
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:09,676
Have you met the others yet?

77
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,103
Why am I here?

78
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:17,392
I'm hoping we can get to the bottom
of that mystery together.

79
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:22,063
Let's discuss what happened
yesterday, Kristen.

80
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:24,357
What's the first thing you remember?

81
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:28,243
Fire.

82
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:29,988
And before that?

83
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:37,829
Tell me about this farmhouse,
the one you burned down.

84
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:40,832
Why do you think you went there?

85
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:47,422
You had the address for the place
written on the palm of your hand.

86
00:15:49,174 --> 00:15:51,676
It must have some significance.

87
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:56,354
No.

88
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,391
Do you think
you'd been there before?

89
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:01,901
I...

90
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:03,444
I don't know.

91
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:06,482
Burning down that house
won't destroy those memories.

92
00:16:08,276 --> 00:16:09,868
You've got to deal with them.

93
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:12,780
Let's deal with them together, OK?

94
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:15,033
No. No!

95
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:21,206
Often the root of a problem like this
lies with an emotional trauma.

96
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,667
There is no emotional trauma.

97
00:16:24,702 --> 00:16:27,343
How do you know?

98
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:31,508
Look, why don't you just let me go?

99
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:34,058
I'll stay out of trouble.

100
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,408
And then you never
have to think of me again.

101
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:39,335
I'm trying to help you.
I don't need your help!

102
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,227
Yet, here you are...
confused and disturbed.

103
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,564
I'm not crazy.

104
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:49,901
We don't like to use that word here.

105
00:16:52,028 --> 00:16:55,323
Who's we? Your friends
behind the mirror over there?

106
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:08,002
Thatta girl.

107
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,922
Make you feel good.

108
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:16,177
Nighty-night.

109
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

110
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,552
Going somewhere, darling?

111
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:43,640
We can do this all night long.
Let go of me!

112
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,851
Let go of me!

113
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:52,232
Get off me!

114
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:38,838
Got some clothes for you.

115
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:06,011
What is her story?

116
00:21:06,046 --> 00:21:08,646
Oh, she's just crazy.

117
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:11,173
Like me. And you.

118
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,665
And like all of us.

119
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:18,294
¤ Boom-boom,
ain't it great to be crazy? ¤

120
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:20,046
Speak for yourself, lunatic.

121
00:21:21,631 --> 00:21:24,467
¤ Boom-boom,
ain't it great to be crazy?! ¤

122
00:21:24,502 --> 00:21:26,803
Stop it. You're gonna
make my ears bleed.

123
00:21:26,838 --> 00:21:28,930
¤ BOOM-BOOM, AIN'T IT... ¤

124
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:32,398
Ow! You...! You bitch!

125
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:34,185
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I hurt you?

126
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,937
Did I hurt your little hand?

127
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:36,945
Don't!

128
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,898
You'll get us all in trouble.

129
00:21:43,152 --> 00:21:46,447
Come on, now,
don't you think that'd be fun?

130
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:49,471
If you and I went
and saw a movie together,

131
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:52,453
we could snuggle up
real close in the dark.

132
00:21:52,488 --> 00:21:54,247
We'd just be by ourselves.

133
00:21:54,282 --> 00:21:55,748
I wanna draw you.

134
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:01,713
Come on. It'll be fun.

135
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:07,302
Just... Just act natural.

136
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:10,471
Look up.

137
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:15,852
They've been here before.

138
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:17,353
Who are they?

139
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:21,357
Those are the sad people.

140
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:23,992
Always so sad.

141
00:22:24,027 --> 00:22:26,411
He's a great doctor.

142
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,281
I overheard the staff
talking about him.

143
00:22:28,316 --> 00:22:30,405
Apparently the way
he's dealing with us

144
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,494
is some sort of
experimental therapy.

145
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:34,787
Futuristic kind of stuff.

146
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:39,751
And what do I need to say to this guy
to get out of lockdown?

147
00:22:39,786 --> 00:22:42,504
I mean, you know,
to get night privileges.

148
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,180
No one has night privileges.

149
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:47,759
I just saw this girl walking around
in the halls last night.

150
00:22:47,794 --> 00:22:48,808
That's impossible.

151
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:50,803
And someone came into my room
the other night.

152
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:54,272
¤ Someone came
into my room... ¤

153
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:56,684
Just ignore her.
She never makes any sense.

154
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:59,027
¤ Someone

155
00:22:59,062 --> 00:23:01,029
¤ Someone... ¤

156
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:03,441
Listen, don't let this place
get to you.

157
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:04,449
¤ Someone... ¤

158
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:05,992
You stay locked up long enough

159
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:07,654
and you start to believe
that you're nuts.

160
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:48,368
¤ Run

161
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:50,697
¤ Run, baby, run

162
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,659
¤ Run, baby, run

163
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:58,746
¤ Run, baby, run

164
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:03,981
¤ Run, baby, run
¤ Oh, come back to me

165
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:08,089
¤ Run, baby, run
¤ Bring your kisses to me

166
00:24:08,124 --> 00:24:14,012
¤ Run, baby, run
¤ Back into my arms

167
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:19,308
¤ Run, baby, run
¤ I need you, baby

168
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:24,397
¤ Run, baby, run
¤ I don't mean maybe

169
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:29,444
¤ Run, baby, run
¤ Back into my arms

170
00:24:30,528 --> 00:24:33,698
¤ And even though you hurt me

171
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:36,124
¤ I still love you

172
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
¤ It's true even though I know... ¤

173
00:24:56,012 --> 00:24:58,932
It's OK. I've got you.

174
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:04,562
I don't like the dark.

175
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:09,817
Shhh.
Bad things happen in the dark.

176
00:25:13,321 --> 00:25:15,156
See, it's OK.

177
00:25:17,158 --> 00:25:18,660
It's alright.

178
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Ah!

179
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,579
Did you need some help?

180
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:05,832
Just keep a lookout.

181
00:26:17,135 --> 00:26:19,804
Why are they giving us
all this stuff?

182
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:22,473
They don't know what they're doing.

183
00:26:22,508 --> 00:26:25,202
Thorazine, Mellaril.

184
00:26:25,237 --> 00:26:27,896
Now they give us this.

185
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:32,609
It's tasty.

186
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,987
Got anything for me?

187
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:40,074
You're not supposed
to be in here.

188
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:41,659
Shut up.

189
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:49,501
You seem to be getting
in the middle of things, new girl.

190
00:26:49,536 --> 00:26:51,669
If I were you, I'd watch out.

191
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

192
00:28:14,878 --> 00:28:17,005
What is it? What's the matter?

193
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,925
Something was in here.

194
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:33,194
Listen to me, something was in there.

195
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:37,240
Something not... not right,
not... not human.

196
00:28:37,275 --> 00:28:39,903
It's going to be OK.
We just need to calm you down.

197
00:28:39,938 --> 00:28:42,906
Please, you've got to believe me.

198
00:29:39,963 --> 00:29:42,257
Please, wait, please...

199
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:46,810
Wait, please...

200
00:29:46,845 --> 00:29:48,763
Please don't do this to me.

201
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:50,682
Relax. It won't hurt you.

202
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:55,944
Call Dr. Stringer, please.

203
00:29:55,979 --> 00:29:58,314
I'm right here, I'm right here.

204
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:00,698
Please... Please...

205
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:04,654
This is a bit. Bite down on it
or you'll bite your tongue off.

206
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:08,706
No, please...

207
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:11,452
The medications
aren't working as I'd hope.

208
00:30:11,487 --> 00:30:14,706
This treatment should be beneficial.

209
00:30:38,146 --> 00:30:40,899
I thought they stopped
using electroshock.

210
00:30:40,934 --> 00:30:42,407
Just look at her.

211
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:45,778
She was all riled up before,
now she's docile as a lamb.

212
00:30:45,813 --> 00:30:49,032
Hell, I wish they'd do it
to all the patients here,

213
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,534
just fry the crazy
right out of them.

214
00:31:09,344 --> 00:31:11,262
Come on, sleepyhead.

215
00:31:12,597 --> 00:31:15,183
It's time to wake up. Come on.

216
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:17,936
Come on.

217
00:32:07,277 --> 00:32:12,365
So, since we have a new member,
let's go over the rules.

218
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:15,869
Everyone gets a chance to talk.

219
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:17,745
No interrupting.

220
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,832
Just say what's on your minds.

221
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:23,001
Who'd like to begin?

222
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,091
Emily?

223
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:34,686
What did you do to Kristen?

224
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:38,516
We had to have a little unscheduled
therapy last night.

225
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:40,108
Is that what you call it?

226
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:42,318
It's nothing to be
alarmed about, Emily.

227
00:32:42,353 --> 00:32:45,857
Sometimes when you take people away,
they don't come back.

228
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:49,402
Tammy didn't come back.

229
00:32:49,437 --> 00:32:51,327
Who's Tammy?

230
00:32:51,362 --> 00:32:53,615
She's the last one that got out.

231
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,039
What did you say?

232
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:58,745
Iris, you know we don't discuss
people who aren't present.

233
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,039
Wait. Why can't we talk
about Tammy?

234
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:02,964
Who's Tammy?

235
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:05,502
Zoey, how do you feel
about all this?

236
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,298
Zoey?

237
00:33:16,012 --> 00:33:17,520
OK.

238
00:33:17,555 --> 00:33:22,101
Let's discuss what happened yesterday,
shall we, in the showers?

239
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:25,028
Kristen?

240
00:33:25,063 --> 00:33:29,859
Well... I didn't see a thing.

241
00:33:29,894 --> 00:33:31,534
I believe her.

242
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:35,698
Great. That's someone
you want on your side.

243
00:33:40,954 --> 00:33:42,664
Are you OK?

244
00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:48,920
I don't know what's going on
in this place.

245
00:33:48,955 --> 00:33:51,005
It'll be OK.

246
00:33:52,173 --> 00:33:55,301
I can tell you are strong.

247
00:33:55,844 --> 00:33:58,394
See you later, alligators.

248
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:02,225
I'm off to what should be
my last session with Stringer.

249
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,401
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm being released.

250
00:34:05,436 --> 00:34:07,856
That's impossible.
I've been here longer than you.

251
00:34:07,891 --> 00:34:10,824
Stringer told you
he was releasing you?

252
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:15,864
Not in those words, but he said
I'm making great progress.

253
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:19,624
You're not going anywhere.
Yes, I am.

254
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,786
How did you get him
to release you, though?

255
00:34:21,821 --> 00:34:23,878
How did you act? What did you say?

256
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:27,584
I didn't act cured, Kristen,
if that's what you're getting at.

257
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:29,377
I am cured.

258
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:33,506
I'm ready.

259
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,471
Do you really think
she's getting outta here?

260
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:47,562
How have you been feeling?
Better.

261
00:34:48,688 --> 00:34:50,530
I've been drawing a lot.

262
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:53,318
And I'm getting along with everybody,
even the new girl.

263
00:34:54,652 --> 00:34:57,030
I have some of
your latest work here.

264
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,867
Where did you get those?

265
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:06,456
You really managed
to capture her essence.

266
00:35:06,491 --> 00:35:08,173
I was just fooling around.

267
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:11,259
You're really quite talented, Iris.

268
00:35:11,294 --> 00:35:13,087
I'm practically cured,
don't you think?

269
00:35:16,007 --> 00:35:18,016
That's an old one.

270
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:20,699
I'm not like that anymore, really.

271
00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:23,348
You're making considerable progress.

272
00:35:23,383 --> 00:35:24,814
So I can go?

273
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:26,726
Let's see how things go today, hmm?

274
00:35:29,437 --> 00:35:32,232
The others didn't believe me.
They don't think that I'm better.

275
00:35:34,776 --> 00:35:36,451
Why are you doing that?

276
00:35:36,486 --> 00:35:39,280
I'd like to try something
a little different this time.

277
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:48,248
What is that?
It's a metronome.

278
00:35:55,129 --> 00:35:57,277
Listen to the rhythm.

279
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,425
It'll help you to relax.

280
00:36:01,803 --> 00:36:03,888
OK, close your eyes.

281
00:36:08,685 --> 00:36:11,813
I haven't had any problems
in a while.

282
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:17,277
I'm feeling better. Healthier.

283
00:36:17,312 --> 00:36:19,821
Focus on your home.

284
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:22,122
Imagine it.

285
00:36:22,157 --> 00:36:25,451
Imagine your parents there
waiting for you.

286
00:36:28,204 --> 00:36:31,005
I'm starting to get sleepy.

287
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,626
Can you describe your home for me?

288
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:38,131
What color is your house?

289
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:45,430
We live... in a little white house.

290
00:36:48,141 --> 00:36:52,520
I have to... go to sleep.

291
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:56,900
It's September 3, 1958.

292
00:36:56,935 --> 00:36:58,741
It's night time.

293
00:36:58,776 --> 00:37:01,779
You are asleep in your bedroom.

294
00:37:09,704 --> 00:37:11,748
She's asleep in my office.

295
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:19,881
Where did she go?

296
00:37:26,596 --> 00:37:28,097
Find her.

297
00:37:32,727 --> 00:37:35,021
Where are we going?

298
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:39,400
No.

299
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:44,405
This isn't right.

300
00:37:46,157 --> 00:37:48,576
No.

301
00:37:50,453 --> 00:37:54,290
No! No! No! No!

302
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:58,301
No! No!

303
00:37:58,336 --> 00:38:01,714
Oh, please don't.
Please don't hurt me, please.

304
00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:04,140
I'm so sorry.

305
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:07,310
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

306
00:38:07,345 --> 00:38:11,015
I just wanna go home.
I just wanna go home.

307
00:38:13,935 --> 00:38:16,528
No! Oh, my God, No! Please!

308
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:19,274
Please don't do this!
Please! Please!

309
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:22,026
No. Help!

310
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:28,408
No! No!

311
00:39:02,317 --> 00:39:04,110
It's alright.

312
00:39:05,487 --> 00:39:08,204
Where's Iris?

313
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:10,992
She's not back yet?

314
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:15,079
OK, time for bed.

315
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:17,213
Where's Iris?

316
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,667
Come on, time for bed.

317
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,396
Go to sleep.

318
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:27,408
Anyone see Iris today?

319
00:40:27,443 --> 00:40:31,281
Maybe they let her go home.
No way.

320
00:40:52,218 --> 00:40:53,768
Nurse Lundt.

321
00:40:53,803 --> 00:40:56,222
Please, Nurse Lundt.

322
00:40:57,765 --> 00:40:59,350
Where's Iris?

323
00:41:02,312 --> 00:41:05,231
If she went home, why didn't
she take her sketchbook?

324
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:11,362
You can't get them to tell you anything
around here.

325
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:13,323
Trust me, I've tried.

326
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:23,309
Kristen, tell me
what's bothering you.

327
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,818
Did you treat a girl named Alice?

328
00:42:33,027 --> 00:42:34,612
Where did you hear that name?

329
00:42:35,905 --> 00:42:38,720
That's who attacked me
in the showers.

330
00:42:38,755 --> 00:42:41,536
You're not gonna answer me, are you?

331
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,337
What happened to Iris?

332
00:42:44,372 --> 00:42:47,924
How many girls have disappeared
at this hospital?

333
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:51,087
Nurse Lundt was wiping someone's
name off the door when I got here.

334
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:53,096
Well, you were heavily sedated.

335
00:42:53,131 --> 00:42:55,175
I'm sure you believe
you saw what you say.

336
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,888
It happened.

337
00:43:05,768 --> 00:43:07,312
What happened to them?

338
00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:08,903
To whom?

339
00:43:08,938 --> 00:43:12,025
To Iris, Alice, Tammy.

340
00:43:14,027 --> 00:43:15,653
Are they dead?

341
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,948
Why would you think they're dead?

342
00:43:22,285 --> 00:43:24,370
There's a ghost in here.

343
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:28,208
A ghost?

344
00:43:30,293 --> 00:43:33,511
What does it look like?
A girl.

345
00:43:33,546 --> 00:43:36,716
The girl that attacked me
in the shower.

346
00:43:36,751 --> 00:43:39,594
The one I see in the halls.

347
00:43:41,262 --> 00:43:44,432
Same with the other girls.
I know they've seen her too.

348
00:43:44,467 --> 00:43:50,313
So, please, tell me
what's going on here.

349
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:57,285
Please.

350
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,864
I can't give you the answers, Kristen.

351
00:43:59,899 --> 00:44:02,408
You have to find them for yourself.

352
00:44:03,493 --> 00:44:05,585
Goddammit! Tell me!

353
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,122
Take Kristen back to her room.

354
00:44:08,157 --> 00:44:10,625
You just don't give up, do you?

355
00:44:16,923 --> 00:44:19,008
Let go of me!

356
00:44:28,142 --> 00:44:29,644
Who's Alice?

357
00:44:31,354 --> 00:44:34,649
You all know she's here,
so why won't you answer me?

358
00:44:35,942 --> 00:44:37,242
Look at me!

359
00:44:37,277 --> 00:44:40,238
Sorry, I don't converse
with loonies.

360
00:44:46,786 --> 00:44:48,545
Don't you ever call me that!

361
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,089
Don't do this.
Tell me who Alice is.

362
00:44:51,124 --> 00:44:56,588
Alice Hudson was here. She was
one of us but she's gone now.

363
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:02,677
Gone?

364
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,724
Where?
She got out, they let her out.

365
00:45:12,937 --> 00:45:14,564
I'm getting outta here.

366
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:16,823
Tonight.

367
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:18,589
I'm gonna find Iris.

368
00:45:18,624 --> 00:45:20,285
Really?
Really.

369
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,239
You can't get out.
Watch me.

370
00:45:24,866 --> 00:45:27,494
You coming with me?
How?

371
00:45:30,872 --> 00:45:32,707
Zoey, give me your penny.

372
00:45:45,178 --> 00:45:47,722
She won't let us leave.

373
00:45:54,604 --> 00:45:55,612
Hello?

374
00:45:55,647 --> 00:45:59,234
Leonard! Yes,
thanks for calling me back.

375
00:45:59,269 --> 00:46:01,868
I need a consult.

376
00:46:01,903 --> 00:46:04,906
Still the same lost causes, yes.

377
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,369
The problem is that
things have begun to escalate.

378
00:46:09,404 --> 00:46:11,586
Alright. Let's see.

379
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:14,088
I need you to shove this in here like this

380
00:46:14,123 --> 00:46:17,001
so it seems locked but you can
still open it from the outside.

381
00:46:17,036 --> 00:46:18,009
OK.

382
00:46:18,044 --> 00:46:19,552
And then you're gonna get into bed.

383
00:46:19,587 --> 00:46:22,465
Make sure you have all your clothes on,
but hide it with the covers.

384
00:46:24,634 --> 00:46:26,970
And then I'm gonna come
and get you after bed check.

385
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:29,681
Then what?
Then we get Iris and get outta here.

386
00:46:29,716 --> 00:46:32,976
Why do you care so much about Iris?

387
00:46:34,811 --> 00:46:37,146
I care about getting us all
out of here alive.

388
00:46:48,074 --> 00:46:49,075
Open.

389
00:47:20,815 --> 00:47:23,818
Alright, we gotta go now. Come on.

390
00:51:05,582 --> 00:51:07,834
I don't think this is the right way.

391
00:51:10,503 --> 00:51:12,005
Ah, in here.

392
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:21,347
It's a morgue.

393
00:51:42,494 --> 00:51:43,661
Hide!

394
00:52:05,808 --> 00:52:07,317
Someone's been in there.

395
00:52:07,352 --> 00:52:09,979
Come on,
let's take a look around.

396
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Do you see anything?
No.

397
00:52:47,267 --> 00:52:48,768
Emily?

398
00:53:11,082 --> 00:53:12,590
Emily?

399
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:14,711
Is that you?

400
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

401
00:54:09,766 --> 00:54:11,267
Alice?

402
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

403
00:54:39,087 --> 00:54:40,588
Nice try.

404
00:55:51,701 --> 00:55:53,209
Kristen!

405
00:55:53,244 --> 00:55:56,713
Emily! What happened?

406
00:55:56,748 --> 00:55:59,480
Those orderlies caught me.

407
00:55:59,515 --> 00:56:02,212
And they hurt my arms.

408
00:56:04,506 --> 00:56:06,382
Did you find Iris?

409
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:09,642
No.

410
00:56:09,677 --> 00:56:12,013
She's gone.

411
00:56:13,223 --> 00:56:15,141
She's not coming back.

412
00:56:17,227 --> 00:56:20,563
Look, if we don't get out of here,

413
00:56:20,598 --> 00:56:22,071
we're next.

414
00:56:22,106 --> 00:56:24,442
We're not getting out.

415
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,278
We have to try again.

416
00:56:28,363 --> 00:56:32,242
Nobody... gets out.

417
00:56:36,037 --> 00:56:37,413
Hello!

418
00:56:42,085 --> 00:56:44,775
So... Roy...
Not interested.

419
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,465
You didn't even hear me out.

420
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,474
Fine. Shoot.

421
00:56:49,509 --> 00:56:54,347
Well, I know you said you wouldn't
date any of us inside the ward.

422
00:56:54,382 --> 00:56:57,941
But I just know I'm getting out soon

423
00:56:57,976 --> 00:57:00,937
and I thought maybe you could
call me some time.

424
00:57:00,972 --> 00:57:06,484
There is no way I will
ever, ever date you.

425
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:08,451
Got it?

426
00:57:08,486 --> 00:57:11,079
But I...
No! Not ever.

427
00:57:11,114 --> 00:57:15,326
Now, leave me alone. I'm swamped
here and I don't have time for this.

428
00:57:28,173 --> 00:57:32,802
Tom Stewart killed me.
Tom Stewart killed me.

429
00:57:32,837 --> 00:57:40,477
Tom Stewart killed me!

430
00:57:50,904 --> 00:57:53,990
So, you and cuckoo bird have fun
sneaking out last night?

431
00:57:54,025 --> 00:57:56,666
Go away.

432
00:57:56,701 --> 00:57:58,453
You could have gotten us
all in trouble.

433
00:57:58,488 --> 00:58:00,413
We were looking for Iris.

434
00:58:00,448 --> 00:58:01,414
And?

435
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,968
We couldn't find her.

436
00:58:07,003 --> 00:58:09,714
Well, you probably weren't
looking in the right places.

437
00:58:09,749 --> 00:58:11,216
Not with Magellan over there.

438
00:58:15,512 --> 00:58:17,312
What are you saying?
Nothing.

439
00:58:17,347 --> 00:58:19,432
I saw the two of you
sneaking around last night.

440
00:58:19,467 --> 00:58:21,556
Shut up.
They're watching.

441
00:58:21,591 --> 00:58:23,610
Well, can you blame them?

442
00:58:23,645 --> 00:58:25,945
Just because I was brave enough
to go through with it...

443
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:29,484
Well, maybe next time
you'll do us all a favor and get it right.

444
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:32,452
Boo-hoo. Timid little Zoey.

445
00:58:32,487 --> 00:58:35,657
Why don't you crawl into your shell
and hide, just like a little turtle?

446
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:37,582
Why don't you leave her alone?

447
00:58:37,617 --> 00:58:40,953
What's the matter... Daddy didn't
pay enough attention to you?

448
00:58:40,988 --> 00:58:44,290
Mind your own business.
Why don't you leave us all alone?

449
00:58:44,325 --> 00:58:46,292
I mean, nobody likes you.

450
00:58:47,627 --> 00:58:49,170
Well, you're just jealous.

451
00:58:49,205 --> 00:58:50,505
Of what?
Of me.

452
00:58:51,881 --> 00:58:53,765
You've been jealous of me
since I got here.

453
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,427
I am tired of putting up with
your pathetic behavior, and...

454
00:58:56,462 --> 00:58:58,721
I can't hear you!

455
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
They're all just jealous of me.
Let's see Roy say no to this.

456
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

457
01:00:22,263 --> 01:00:24,481
No! Ah, no!

458
01:00:24,516 --> 01:00:26,601
Please let me go.
Please let me out of here!

459
01:00:26,636 --> 01:00:30,063
Alice, it wasn't my idea, I swear!

460
01:00:30,098 --> 01:00:32,023
They made me do...

461
01:00:32,058 --> 01:00:34,449
No, stop! No!

462
01:00:34,484 --> 01:00:37,654
No, please don't do this! No!

463
01:00:37,689 --> 01:00:39,882
Just let me go! Alice!

464
01:00:39,917 --> 01:00:42,476
No, please don't do this!

465
01:00:42,511 --> 01:00:45,036
No! Please don't do this!

466
01:00:45,071 --> 01:00:47,914
No! No!

467
01:01:37,714 --> 01:01:39,215
Where's Sarah?

468
01:01:52,687 --> 01:01:54,439
Sarah? No!

469
01:01:56,399 --> 01:01:57,907
Where's Sarah?

470
01:01:57,942 --> 01:02:00,361
If Alice got Sarah,
she'll get us all.

471
01:02:00,396 --> 01:02:03,698
No! No, no, no, no!

472
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:15,543
Alice Hudson.

473
01:02:18,087 --> 01:02:19,721
This was hers?

474
01:02:19,756 --> 01:02:22,348
I didn't touch her!

475
01:02:22,383 --> 01:02:27,180
It was Sarah and... the other girls!

476
01:02:31,351 --> 01:02:33,109
What did you do to her?

477
01:02:33,144 --> 01:02:35,438
I don't know what she's talking about.

478
01:02:35,473 --> 01:02:37,482
Yes, you do.
You shut up, Zoey!

479
01:02:37,517 --> 01:02:39,449
This isn't a game!

480
01:02:39,484 --> 01:02:42,243
What did you do to her?

481
01:02:42,278 --> 01:02:44,823
Why does she want to kill us?

482
01:02:47,033 --> 01:02:48,576
What did they do to her?

483
01:02:48,611 --> 01:02:50,084
Zoey...

484
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:52,372
Look, please, Zoey...

485
01:02:52,407 --> 01:02:55,124
I need to know.

486
01:02:56,626 --> 01:02:59,337
A-Alice was bad.

487
01:03:01,464 --> 01:03:03,389
She hurt us.

488
01:03:03,424 --> 01:03:06,344
She hurt us all the time.

489
01:03:07,428 --> 01:03:09,597
Tammy told us what to do.

490
01:03:10,056 --> 01:03:11,731
Tammy was here before you.

491
01:03:11,766 --> 01:03:15,770
She said she could make it stop.

492
01:03:17,689 --> 01:03:20,031
It was her idea.

493
01:03:20,066 --> 01:03:24,571
So... we got rid of her.

494
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:27,448
Alice?

495
01:03:27,483 --> 01:03:28,658
What?

496
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:33,246
I know where your bunny is.

497
01:03:35,999 --> 01:03:38,564
You found it?
Yeah.

498
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:41,129
It's in Tammy's room.

499
01:03:45,925 --> 01:03:47,844
That's mine. You can't have it!

500
01:04:17,582 --> 01:04:19,382
We all helped.

501
01:04:19,417 --> 01:04:22,462
And now she's going to kill us all.

502
01:04:22,497 --> 01:04:24,846
We had to.

503
01:04:24,881 --> 01:04:26,806
She was horrible.

504
01:04:26,841 --> 01:04:29,517
Then why is she after me?

505
01:04:29,552 --> 01:04:31,971
What's it matter? We're all dead.

506
01:04:32,006 --> 01:04:35,099
Emily... Emily!

507
01:04:35,134 --> 01:04:36,601
Emily!

508
01:04:39,354 --> 01:04:42,232
We have to get out of here. OK?

509
01:04:42,267 --> 01:04:44,234
But what about Emily?

510
01:04:44,269 --> 01:04:45,735
We'll get her.

511
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:48,633
Alright?

512
01:04:48,668 --> 01:04:49,697
Come on.

513
01:04:55,161 --> 01:04:57,392
Emily, what are you doing?

514
01:04:57,539 --> 01:04:59,624
I'm not strong like you.

515
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Put the knife down.
I can't!
We're gonna get out of here.

516
01:05:21,938 --> 01:05:23,481
Emily!

517
01:05:37,495 --> 01:05:40,331
No, no, no, no! This can't be happening.

518
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,335
Please don't let her get me!

519
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:45,837
I don't wanna die!

520
01:05:49,174 --> 01:05:50,675
Zoey...

521
01:05:51,843 --> 01:05:53,344
Do you trust me?

522
01:05:58,766 --> 01:06:00,275
Open the door.

523
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,936
Where did you get that?

524
01:06:01,971 --> 01:06:05,029
Open the door now.

525
01:06:05,064 --> 01:06:08,151
Calm down. Don't do
anything you'll regret.

526
01:06:08,186 --> 01:06:09,819
We have an incident in progress.

527
01:06:09,854 --> 01:06:11,488
Open the goddamn door!

528
01:06:18,995 --> 01:06:20,455
Hey...
Hey, back up!

529
01:06:20,872 --> 01:06:22,665
Easy...
Back up!

530
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,459
Calm down.
Back up.

531
01:06:27,378 --> 01:06:29,721
Go to the wall.

532
01:06:29,756 --> 01:06:32,509
Back up! Against the wall.

533
01:06:38,765 --> 01:06:40,266
Come on.

534
01:06:51,611 --> 01:06:53,244
Back up!

535
01:06:53,279 --> 01:06:55,948
Back up. Back up!
You can't do this.

536
01:06:55,983 --> 01:06:58,583
Watch me!
You're only hurting yourself.

537
01:06:58,618 --> 01:07:00,954
What are you gonna do, Kristen?
Where are you gonna go?

538
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:02,914
Away from here.
C'mon, drop the knife.

539
01:07:08,753 --> 01:07:12,340
No! No, let me go! You don't get it!

540
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:14,808
You don't get it!

541
01:07:14,843 --> 01:07:17,741
Alice Hudson is trying to kill us!

542
01:07:17,776 --> 01:07:20,605
Enough.
You can't be serious.

543
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,143
No, please!
Alright, Kristen. Kristen, Kristen...

544
01:07:23,178 --> 01:07:24,651
I need you to calm down.

545
01:07:24,686 --> 01:07:27,063
That girl is a hopeless case
and you know it.

546
01:07:27,098 --> 01:07:28,895
Luckily that's not your call to make.

547
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:30,692
You honestly think you can cure her?

548
01:07:30,727 --> 01:07:32,867
I have to try.

549
01:07:32,902 --> 01:07:34,696
I need more time with her, that's all.

550
01:07:34,731 --> 01:07:36,579
You're as hopeless as she is.

551
01:07:36,614 --> 01:07:38,449
You could spend 100 years with her...

552
01:07:38,484 --> 01:07:40,489
Ahh!

553
01:07:40,524 --> 01:07:42,495
No! No!

554
01:07:45,707 --> 01:07:47,924
Please... please listen to me!

555
01:07:47,959 --> 01:07:50,336
Get her in a straitjacket
and lock her in her room.

556
01:07:50,371 --> 01:07:52,797
Doctor.
You don't understand...

557
01:07:52,832 --> 01:07:57,552
No... we...

558
01:08:04,642 --> 01:08:06,561
I'm sorry.

559
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:08,480
I'm so sorry.

560
01:08:20,325 --> 01:08:22,619
You need to get some rest.

561
01:08:22,654 --> 01:08:24,805
Come on.

562
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,956
Mmm. Mmm!

563
01:08:28,124 --> 01:08:30,001
Down the hatch.

564
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:36,591
There. Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?

565
01:08:38,051 --> 01:08:39,677
Sleep tight, sugar.

566
01:10:20,069 --> 01:10:22,280
Sleep tight, sugar.

567
01:10:23,531 --> 01:10:25,331
Where are we going?

568
01:10:25,366 --> 01:10:26,868
We're getting out of here.

569
01:10:48,431 --> 01:10:50,934
Open this door now!

570
01:11:20,547 --> 01:11:21,679
Stop!

571
01:11:21,714 --> 01:11:25,051
Son of a bitch! Don't you close that...!

572
01:11:25,086 --> 01:11:27,804
Don't you close that goddamn...!

573
01:11:30,723 --> 01:11:34,227
He's really mad.

574
01:11:44,946 --> 01:11:46,781
Hey! Get back here!

575
01:12:09,888 --> 01:12:11,306
Wait!

576
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,988
We're trapped!

577
01:12:20,023 --> 01:12:21,816
Maybe not. Here, come on.

578
01:12:21,851 --> 01:12:22,907
Come on!

579
01:12:22,942 --> 01:12:24,444
Zoey, take this.

580
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:30,492
Come on.

581
01:12:36,706 --> 01:12:38,917
Maybe this goes to the first floor, right?

582
01:12:38,952 --> 01:12:40,460
I'll go first.
Alright. Come on.

583
01:12:41,794 --> 01:12:44,756
Send it back as fast as you can, alright?
I will.

584
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

585
01:13:04,275 --> 01:13:05,283
Hey!

586
01:13:05,318 --> 01:13:07,111
Open this door!

587
01:13:16,955 --> 01:13:18,248
Fuck.

588
01:13:25,463 --> 01:13:27,215
Come on.

589
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:02,041
Zoey?

590
01:14:03,793 --> 01:14:05,170
Zoey!

591
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Zoey!

592
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

593
01:17:02,514 --> 01:17:04,182
What's going on?
What?!

594
01:17:11,981 --> 01:17:15,151
Answers. No lies this time
or I swear to God...

595
01:17:15,186 --> 01:17:17,237
Now!

596
01:17:18,363 --> 01:17:19,906
The truth.

597
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,795
Your name...

598
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:31,376
...is Alice Lee Hudson.

599
01:17:45,849 --> 01:17:46,891
May I?

600
01:18:05,118 --> 01:18:09,038
You were abducted from your home
the night of September 3, 1958.

601
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:17,151
I'm Kristen,

602
01:18:17,186 --> 01:18:18,847
not Alice.

603
01:18:18,882 --> 01:18:20,473
I'm Kristen!

604
01:18:20,508 --> 01:18:23,553
You were left chained up in the
basement of an abandoned farmhouse

605
01:18:23,588 --> 01:18:25,228
for nearly two months...

606
01:18:25,263 --> 01:18:29,184
the same farmhouse you burned down.

607
01:18:29,219 --> 01:18:32,902
You were only 11 years old.

608
01:18:32,937 --> 01:18:37,025
Half starved, sick with fever,
trapped in the darkness,

609
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:39,117
it was a waking nightmare.

610
01:18:39,152 --> 01:18:43,580
Your only escape was into delusion.

611
01:18:43,615 --> 01:18:48,620
In order to survive the trauma,
your psyche fractured.

612
01:18:51,372 --> 01:18:54,751
You suffer from multiple
personality disorder.

613
01:18:57,712 --> 01:19:02,932
Each personality took
a piece of this nightmare

614
01:19:02,967 --> 01:19:05,804
and locked it away from you
for your own protection.

615
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:11,413
But the new personalities
became so... dominant

616
01:19:11,448 --> 01:19:15,396
they completely overwhelmed
Alice's personality.

617
01:19:17,899 --> 01:19:21,611
I know it hasn't been pleasant.

618
01:19:22,362 --> 01:19:24,906
But my techniques are helping you.

619
01:19:24,941 --> 01:19:27,415
After several years of therapy,

620
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:30,641
we've been able to isolate
your different identities.

621
01:19:30,676 --> 01:19:33,832
We'd just begun to single them out
and eliminate them

622
01:19:33,867 --> 01:19:36,209
through some experimental techniques

623
01:19:36,244 --> 01:19:38,419
when you, Kristen, appeared.

624
01:19:43,049 --> 01:19:45,517
I didn't just appear!

625
01:19:45,552 --> 01:19:47,887
Your psyche invented Kristen
to protect itself

626
01:19:47,922 --> 01:19:50,390
from having to relive this trauma.

627
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
And now it's time to say goodbye.

628
01:20:22,589 --> 01:20:24,215
Please don't kill me.

629
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:43,401
Don't move. It's OK.

630
01:20:48,907 --> 01:20:50,992
She's the last one who got out.

631
01:20:51,027 --> 01:20:53,293
What did you say?

632
01:20:53,328 --> 01:20:58,791
Iris, you know we don't
discuss people who aren't present.

633
01:20:58,826 --> 01:21:00,884
She can't remember the rules

634
01:21:00,919 --> 01:21:04,464
because she's the crazy one
around here, you know?

635
01:21:04,499 --> 01:21:06,716
That's enough.

636
01:21:13,723 --> 01:21:15,225
Is she cured?

637
01:21:16,768 --> 01:21:19,395
She'll probably need
a lifetime of therapy,

638
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:23,646
but she's no longer a danger to herself.

639
01:21:23,681 --> 01:21:27,862
She is, essentially...
your daughter again.

640
01:21:28,947 --> 01:21:30,448
Can we please see her now?

641
01:21:34,619 --> 01:21:35,954
Alice?

642
01:21:42,919 --> 01:21:44,796
Honey, are you OK?

643
01:21:47,131 --> 01:21:49,384
We love you, sweetheart.

644
01:21:49,419 --> 01:21:52,011
Mom?

645
01:21:53,096 --> 01:21:54,104
Dad?

646
01:21:54,139 --> 01:21:56,182
Oh, honey...

647
01:22:06,025 --> 01:22:10,071
I figured you'd... want
your things around you.

648
01:22:16,411 --> 01:22:19,038
And I put this one
back together for you too.

649
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:24,252
Thank you.

650
01:22:39,767 --> 01:22:43,605
I think I remember...
What do you remember?

651
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:46,441
Everything.

652
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:50,111
The old farmhouse.

653
01:22:50,146 --> 01:22:52,318
This place.

654
01:22:52,353 --> 01:22:54,456
The others.

655
01:22:54,491 --> 01:22:57,243
Emily, Sarah, Iris,

656
01:22:57,278 --> 01:22:59,961
Kristen...

657
01:22:59,996 --> 01:23:03,124
You can forget all about them now.

658
01:23:05,001 --> 01:23:08,671
When can I get out of here?
I really just wanna go home.

659
01:23:08,706 --> 01:23:12,255
Dr. Stringer says two, maybe three days.

660
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:15,804
I think that's enough
visiting for today.

661
01:23:15,839 --> 01:23:17,729
We'll let you get some rest.

662
01:23:17,764 --> 01:23:20,120
Couldn't we stay just a little bit longer?

663
01:23:20,155 --> 01:23:22,477
You'll have her all to yourself
in no time.

664
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

665
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:30,000
