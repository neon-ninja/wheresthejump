TIMECRIMES

2
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:57,125
Clara!

3
00:01:58,752 --> 00:01:59,878
Clara!

4
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:07,969
Clara!

5
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:13,475
- Didn't you hear me calling you?
- You called me?

6
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:15,644
- Yeah. You didn't hear me?
- No.

7
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:19,481
- This was the one you wanted, right?
- Yeah.

8
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:21,608
- And the fertilizer?
- Up there.

9
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:22,651
Put it there.

10
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:25,153
- You'll assemble it out here?
- Sure.

11
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:28,865
Time flies here.

12
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:31,618
I'm going upstairs to lie down.

13
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:39,561
Telephone!

14
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:41,187
What?

15
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:43,231
What did you say?

16
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,078
Yes?

17
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:58,705
Hello?

18
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:02,250
Who is this?

19
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:19,517
This is a restricted terminal.

20
00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:22,604
Record your message
or give your access code.

21
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,522
Right...

22
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,025
We got a call from this numer.

23
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:31,988
- What were you saying?
- Nothing. The phone rang.

24
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:33,573
Who was it?

25
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:36,826
They didn't say anything.
But I got some weird machine.

26
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:39,746
- Probably the workers.
- Today's Saturday.

27
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,499
Or a neighbor.
Is today Saturday?

28
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:45,126
I thought it was Friday.

29
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:46,795
When's the painter coming?

30
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:48,922
Nobody has our phone number.

31
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:52,133
Then what's the point
of having a phone?

32
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:00,892
Look at him.
Too weak even to argue.

33
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,688
- You haven't slept.
- Yes, I have.

34
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:07,065
"Yes, I have." "Yes, I have."

35
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,917
- Shit.
- What?

36
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:27,669
It's still recording.

37
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,595
This is all set.

38
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:40,432
You'll never get it
through the door.

39
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:41,683
Sure I will.

40
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:44,185
Otherwise we'll put it out here.

41
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:47,147
It's not worth worrying about.

42
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:51,276
- What do you feel like for dinner?
- I don't know. What have we got?

43
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:53,320
I don't know.
There's almost nothing left.

44
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,989
There must be a store
still open in town.

45
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:57,907
How about roast chicken?

46
00:05:58,074 --> 00:06:00,118
I'm not taking the car again.

47
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:02,537
Come on, I'll clean up the kitchen.

48
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:04,789
I don't want to take the car.

49
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:06,291
Come on.

50
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,753
I'll go if the table fits
through the door.

51
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:14,049
Okay. If it doesn't, I'll go.
I promise.

52
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,636
Seriously.
No changing your mind later.

53
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:20,055
- I know you.
- Move, move, move!

54
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:21,932
- What?
- I can't see.

55
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:23,391
Sorry.

56
00:06:23,975 --> 00:06:25,143
There's something up there.

57
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:27,520
In a bush.

58
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:28,647
Let me see.

59
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,982
- Look.
- Where?

60
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,945
There, by the bush.
There's a clearing on the left.

61
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:37,072
- I can't see anything.
- Here.

62
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:38,907
- Where?
- Give it here!

63
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:40,283
Here.

64
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:15,068
You win.

65
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:17,320
What?

66
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:19,864
The table doesn't fit
in the bedroom.

67
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:23,410
I'd rather lose the bet
than have you against me.

68
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:25,787
- Give me the keys.
- Okay.

69
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,332
Never bring this up again.
Not even once, okay?

70
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,251
Yeah.

71
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:32,752
What's wrong?

72
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,504
What do you mean?

73
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,131
The keys.

74
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:40,510
Here.

75
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:44,764
See you later.
I'll leave them by the door.

76
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,182
Okay.

77
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:35,936
Hello?

78
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

79
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,017
Hello!

80
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,440
Hello!

81
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,234
Hello?

82
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,613
Is anybody there?

83
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:22,198
Who is this?

84
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:26,202
- Listen...
- Who are you?

85
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:30,373
This is private property.
Where did you get that walkie-talkie?

86
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,252
I need help. A man is after me.
He's trying to kill me.

87
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:36,796
I jumped the fence and came in.

88
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:39,007
What did you say?
You jumped the fence?

89
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:40,592
What happened?

90
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,219
He stabbed me in the arm
and I ran here.

91
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:45,055
The door was closed, but...

92
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:51,311
- What was that?
- What?

93
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:55,065
It sounded like...

94
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:57,901
I just heard thunder.
You mean that?

95
00:16:59,194 --> 00:17:00,612
Yeah. I think so.

96
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:03,949
Okay, listen. Stay calm.

97
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:08,703
I'm in another building.
I'll be right over. Stay there.

98
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:10,580
Okay, thanks.

99
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:50,370
Hello?

100
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,247
- Yes?
- Did you say something?

101
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,919
One question... Is the man after you
wearing a bandage?

102
00:17:58,086 --> 00:17:59,754
Yeah, a pink one.

103
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,507
- I can see him.
- Where? Where is he?

104
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,218
Far from the house, don't worry.

105
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,971
There are surveillance cameras
everywhere.

106
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:10,515
I have the monitors in front of me.

107
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:13,810
He jumped the fence.

108
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:16,813
Is he coming this way?
Please, call the police.

109
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,233
I'll call them right now.
Hold on.

110
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:22,360
Stay where you are.

111
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,368
Hello?

112
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,330
- Hello?
- Well? How did it go?

113
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:35,123
I don't get it.

114
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,042
What's wrong?

115
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,961
I can't get an outside line.

116
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,504
You don't have a cell?

117
00:18:41,713 --> 00:18:43,381
There's no coverage out here.

118
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:46,384
- What is he doing?
- Walking.

119
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:48,094
- In this direction?
- Yeah.

120
00:18:48,303 --> 00:18:52,390
I broke a window. If he sees it,
he'll know I'm here. What should I do?

121
00:18:52,974 --> 00:18:54,893
I don't know... Where are you?

122
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,979
In a laboratory.
I blocked the door.

123
00:18:58,146 --> 00:19:00,815
No, come up here.
It's much safer.

124
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,734
Where?

125
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,987
I'm in a silo at the edge
of the property, up the hill.

126
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:07,322
And...?

127
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,116
There's a door down the hall
on the right.

128
00:19:10,492 --> 00:19:14,287
Come up the hill. He's coming from
the other side of the house.

129
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:16,081
I don't think he'll see you.

130
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:18,541
If he goes inside, he'll find you.

131
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,252
He's getting closer.
Get outof there.

132
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,005
Get out of there!

133
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,938
- I'm coming out.
- Okay.

134
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,737
That was me. Come up the path.

135
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,489
Stay on it.

136
00:19:55,412 --> 00:19:57,998
Hurry up. The sooner you get here,
the sooner I can turn off

137
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,083
the lights.
He shouldn't see them.

138
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:02,168
Where is he?

139
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,878
He's approaching the house.

140
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:05,797
What's he doing?

141
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,882
Keep quiet, I'll guide you.

142
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:09,759
He's checking the windows.

143
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:14,514
He's seen the broken one.

144
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:18,852
- Is he going in?
- Keep quiet.

145
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:23,857
He's going around the house.

146
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,693
He's seen the path.

147
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:28,236
Hold on.

148
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:32,115
Impossible. I've lost the signal
from one of the cameras.

149
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:33,950
I've lost another.

150
00:20:34,743 --> 00:20:38,204
Shit I can't see anything!
I don't know where he is! Run!

151
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,971
Please, turn off the lights.

152
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,529
I see something on up there.
Is that you?

153
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,282
That's me, it's okay.

154
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:20,413
I hear the car.

155
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,876
It's him! He's coming up!

156
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:45,146
Can he get in?

157
00:21:45,313 --> 00:21:46,189
No, it's okay.

158
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,024
- Can you lock that?
- No.

159
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:50,568
- Shit, let's go.
- There's nowhere else to go.

160
00:21:50,735 --> 00:21:51,987
We're safe here.

161
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:01,454
What is all this?

162
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:07,168
You can hide in there.

163
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:10,422
What? What is that?

164
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:15,218
Look.

165
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:21,016
I can lower the hatch to hide you.

166
00:22:35,071 --> 00:22:36,531
Does this door have a lock?

167
00:22:36,698 --> 00:22:37,949
Is there another door?

168
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:40,201
Another way out?
Can we turn off these damn lights?

169
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,915
He'll never think to look in there.

170
00:22:46,374 --> 00:22:47,375
What about you?

171
00:22:49,044 --> 00:22:54,215
I have to lower the hatch from here.
I'll activate it and get in with you.

172
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

173
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:12,817
Okay.

174
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:19,866
Come on!

175
00:24:40,655 --> 00:24:41,823
Who are you?

176
00:24:44,492 --> 00:24:45,493
What?

177
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:48,079
Who are you?

178
00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:56,880
What?

179
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:00,842
- What did you do to me?
- I don't know what you mean.

180
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:02,719
You said you'd get in with me.

181
00:25:03,762 --> 00:25:04,930
I said what?

182
00:25:11,436 --> 00:25:13,188
You've been here before, right?

183
00:25:13,355 --> 00:25:15,732
Was the tank full of white liquid?

184
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,745
We've seen each other before, right?

185
00:25:36,211 --> 00:25:38,505
The liquid you're soaked in...

186
00:25:38,922 --> 00:25:40,173
That tank

187
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:42,050
is still a prototype.

188
00:25:42,217 --> 00:25:43,927
It's actually a...

189
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,907
- This was the one you wanted, right?
- Yeah.

190
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:07,867
- And the fertilizer?
- Up there.

191
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:09,035
Put it there.

192
00:26:40,317 --> 00:26:41,901
You went back in time.

193
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:50,452
- Where are you going?
- Home, to call the police.

194
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:52,662
- No, wait.
- Stay away from me.

195
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:55,832
For God's sake,
you can't go home.

196
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:57,959
What?

197
00:26:58,543 --> 00:27:00,879
You're already home.
Want another look?

198
00:27:21,983 --> 00:27:24,361
- They're doing exactly what...
- Listen.

199
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,656
Today is September 16, 2006.

200
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,533
No, it can't be.

201
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:34,245
- What day did you think it was?
- I don't know.

202
00:27:34,412 --> 00:27:36,665
But I got in the tank on the 16th,
and it was night already.

203
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,126
So you only traveled...

204
00:27:41,044 --> 00:27:42,212
a little while.

205
00:27:47,092 --> 00:27:49,094
What do you mean, a little while?

206
00:27:50,178 --> 00:27:52,806
You're not listening.
You traveled in time.

207
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:56,393
Into the past.
That's why you can see yourself.

208
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,106
You traveled to a past where
you're still at home, in your garden.

209
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:03,024
So what do I do now?

210
00:28:04,234 --> 00:28:06,403
How did you get in the machine?

211
00:28:09,531 --> 00:28:12,742
How did I get in?
Look, I was at home, okay?

212
00:28:12,951 --> 00:28:14,786
- And suddenly...
- Don't tell me.

213
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:19,249
It's better not to know details.
You found me at the silo

214
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:22,877
- and I asked you to get in the tank.
- Yeah, but you...

215
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:25,046
Okay. If that's how it was,

216
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,133
everything is solved.

217
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:29,593
Why?

218
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,430
- All you have to do is wait.
- Wait... for what?

219
00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:35,974
There's nobody else here.

220
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,809
Come on.

221
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:44,399
What was your name again?

222
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:45,984
- Hector.
- Hector, right.

223
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:49,029
Who is the man in my home?

224
00:28:49,863 --> 00:28:51,197
He's you.

225
00:28:51,698 --> 00:28:53,408
- He's me?
- Technically

226
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:56,286
you're the same person.
He's like your reflection.

227
00:28:56,453 --> 00:28:58,955
You're looking in the mirror.
Only this mirror

228
00:28:59,164 --> 00:29:03,084
shows what you were doing
roughly about an hour ago.

229
00:29:09,257 --> 00:29:11,509
But that man is in my home.

230
00:29:11,676 --> 00:29:14,304
And he'll leave,
in the same way you did.

231
00:29:16,264 --> 00:29:17,807
How can I put this?

232
00:29:24,606 --> 00:29:25,690
Come on.

233
00:29:40,622 --> 00:29:41,748
Excuse me.

234
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:42,958
You want one?

235
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,459
No.

236
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:46,378
Sit over there.

237
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:03,770
This is you. This arrow moves forward
from past to future, okay?

238
00:30:04,396 --> 00:30:06,398
But at this point you enter the tank

239
00:30:06,564 --> 00:30:09,025
and travel an hour and a half
into the past.

240
00:30:09,192 --> 00:30:10,443
To here.

241
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:14,990
You become a sort of Hector 2.
The one at your house

242
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:16,574
- is Hector 1.
- Hector 1?

243
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:19,995
Hector 1, your reflection in the mirror,
remember? Look, you're here.

244
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:22,872
You're seeing yourself,
but there's only one arrow.

245
00:30:24,624 --> 00:30:25,792
For how long?

246
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,544
Your reflection will last up to here.

247
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:30,088
This is what we'll do:

248
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:33,508
Hide here. I'll configure the tank
in the basement

249
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:35,343
and go up to the silo.
I'll have it ready

250
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,053
and I'll wait for nightfall.

251
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:40,599
Hector 1 will show up,
I'll get him into the machine

252
00:30:40,765 --> 00:30:42,100
and send him to the past

253
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:43,226
So here's the deal.

254
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:44,269
What deal?

255
00:30:58,033 --> 00:31:00,493
I'll bring everything back to normal
and you won't tell anyone

256
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,911
about any of this.

257
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,374
I shouldn't be here.

258
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:10,253
The center is normally closed weekends,
but I felt like staying.

259
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:16,259
I'm going up.

260
00:32:08,478 --> 00:32:09,688
Yes?

261
00:32:10,021 --> 00:32:11,356
Hello?

262
00:32:13,984 --> 00:32:15,235
Who is this?

263
00:32:36,673 --> 00:32:38,008
What the fuck...?

264
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:41,595
This is a restricted terminal.

265
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:44,723
Record your message
or give your access code.

266
00:32:45,473 --> 00:32:48,393
Right.. We got a call
from this number.

267
00:32:51,354 --> 00:32:53,815
- What were you saying?
- Nothing. The phone rang.

268
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:55,692
Who was it?

269
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:58,695
They didn't say anything.
But I got some weird machine.

270
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:00,822
- Probably the workers.
- What is this?

271
00:33:01,865 --> 00:33:03,241
You called your house?

272
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,910
- Is today Saturday?
- I say lay low

273
00:33:06,077 --> 00:33:07,329
and you call your house?

274
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:09,914
- You can't stop me.
- Then what's the point

275
00:33:10,081 --> 00:33:11,124
of having a phone?

276
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:13,376
- Did you talk to yourself?
- No.

277
00:33:13,668 --> 00:33:15,128
I called my house... that's it.

278
00:33:15,712 --> 00:33:16,922
Did you talk to yourself?

279
00:33:17,088 --> 00:33:19,257
My wife is at home with that...

280
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:20,467
Look at him.

281
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:22,469
Too weak to even argue.

282
00:33:23,803 --> 00:33:25,513
- You haven't slept
- Yes, I have.

283
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,265
"Yes, I have." "Yes, I have."

284
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:34,648
Do you remember getting that call?

285
00:33:34,814 --> 00:33:37,609
At your house?
Do you remember answering?

286
00:33:38,818 --> 00:33:39,945
Yes.

287
00:33:40,111 --> 00:33:42,405
Before I left,
I got a call from myself.

288
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:47,202
Then everything still fits, right?

289
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:54,292
I'm going up to the silo.

290
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:56,336
The tank needs to be filled.

291
00:33:59,965 --> 00:34:03,468
I can't put a chain on you,
or lock you in the basement.

292
00:34:04,678 --> 00:34:08,765
But if you alter events and stop
Hector 1 from getting in the tank,

293
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,393
it will be the end of your life
as you know it.

294
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:13,812
Shit. It's still recording.

295
00:34:14,437 --> 00:34:18,650
And your wife will still prefer
being with him to being with you.

296
00:34:20,318 --> 00:34:22,904
Can't I just go home and explain?

297
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:29,119
There are rooms upstairs.

298
00:34:29,577 --> 00:34:31,371
I'll come and get you
when it's over.

299
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:33,164
I...

300
00:34:57,397 --> 00:34:58,815
Fuck!

301
00:38:15,637 --> 00:38:16,930
Who is that man

302
00:38:17,097 --> 00:38:17,847
in my home?

303
00:38:18,014 --> 00:38:18,807
He's you.

304
00:38:18,974 --> 00:38:20,183
But that man

305
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,351
is in my home.

306
00:38:21,518 --> 00:38:24,104
And he'll leave,
in the same way you did.

307
00:38:24,688 --> 00:38:28,149
Technically you're the same person.
He's like your reflection.

308
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:30,860
Can't I just go home and explain?

309
00:38:31,027 --> 00:38:33,697
It will be the end of your life
as you know it

310
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:35,865
What am I supposed to do now?

311
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:41,663
My God... What the fuck?

312
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,747
Hello?

313
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:51,506
Are you all right?

314
00:39:06,771 --> 00:39:07,981
I'm okay.

315
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,029
What happened to your face?

316
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:18,491
I got hit. Nothing serious.

317
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:21,202
Don't move. I'll be right back.

318
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:22,871
I'll call an ambulance.

319
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:46,478
What are you doing?

320
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:50,315
I said to stay put.

321
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:51,691
No, I'm okay.

322
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:55,904
There.

323
00:40:04,412 --> 00:40:06,247
Shit, no signal.

324
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:08,792
I'll find a phone.
Wait for me here.

325
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,918
No, don't go!

326
00:40:11,795 --> 00:40:13,171
Please.

327
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:15,799
I'm a little dizzy.

328
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:21,179
You want some water?

329
00:40:21,346 --> 00:40:22,472
Yes, thank you.

330
00:40:27,477 --> 00:40:28,812
I'd be right back.

331
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,732
The sooner an ambulance comes,
the better.

332
00:40:42,742 --> 00:40:44,661
Hold on, it'll come unraveled.

333
00:40:56,298 --> 00:40:57,549
Here, let me.

334
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:02,345
I was just cutting my neighbor's hair.

335
00:41:03,805 --> 00:41:05,348
That way it won't fall off.

336
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,228
I'll get help.

337
00:41:10,395 --> 00:41:12,147
Wait for me here, okay?

338
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:27,537
Wait.

339
00:41:27,912 --> 00:41:28,747
What's wrong?

340
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:33,627
I don't know how to explain this.

341
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:36,880
I need your help.

342
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,174
- Excuse me?
- Come on.

343
00:41:52,687 --> 00:41:55,732
Have a seat and don't move
until an ambulance comes. Please.

344
00:42:03,198 --> 00:42:04,407
What are you doing?

345
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:10,997
Let's go, that way.

346
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:12,624
Why?

347
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:14,376
- Please, that way.
- No.

348
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:18,880
I need your help with something.
Come on, follow me.

349
00:42:23,843 --> 00:42:25,929
Let's go back to the road.
That way.

350
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:28,723
No, keep going forward.

351
00:42:31,977 --> 00:42:33,645
I have to go.

352
00:42:38,275 --> 00:42:39,359
That way.

353
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:41,111
Please.

354
00:42:41,611 --> 00:42:42,612
Trust me.

355
00:42:49,995 --> 00:42:53,540
Don't worry, it's okay.
I need you to do something for me.

356
00:42:54,249 --> 00:42:56,501
- I'll explain later.
- Why not now?

357
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,878
It's not easy to explain.

358
00:43:11,516 --> 00:43:12,225
No!

359
00:43:23,528 --> 00:43:24,404
Shit!

360
00:44:12,577 --> 00:44:14,037
Do as I say.

361
00:44:31,429 --> 00:44:33,348
Turn your head to the right.

362
00:44:33,723 --> 00:44:35,141
No, my right.

363
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,519
Now lower your head a bit.

364
00:44:38,895 --> 00:44:40,063
A bit more.

365
00:44:42,065 --> 00:44:42,899
Don't look at me.

366
00:44:48,238 --> 00:44:51,199
Now bite your left thumb.

367
00:44:51,741 --> 00:44:52,909
Slowly.

368
00:44:55,161 --> 00:44:57,455
Like you're thinking of something.

369
00:45:03,295 --> 00:45:04,754
Now pull up your shirt.

370
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:06,881
Take it off.

371
00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:09,134
Now!

372
00:45:10,885 --> 00:45:12,053
Slowly.

373
00:45:21,771 --> 00:45:22,814
I'm sorry.

374
00:45:24,232 --> 00:45:27,319
Whatever I ask you to do,
I won't hurt you.

375
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:32,490
You can put it back on.
We're done. You see?

376
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:35,368
Can I go now?

377
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,830
Hide there, by that rock.

378
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:43,084
Crouch there.

379
00:45:59,392 --> 00:46:00,727
Take off your pants.

380
00:46:01,144 --> 00:46:02,938
You can put them back on later.

381
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,024
Go on.

382
00:46:06,733 --> 00:46:09,235
- What are you doing?
- I have to stand up, don't I?

383
00:46:09,444 --> 00:46:10,779
Okay, hand them over.

384
00:46:26,002 --> 00:46:27,504
Should I take off anything else?

385
00:46:27,671 --> 00:46:29,005
No, it's okay. Give them to me.

386
00:46:29,756 --> 00:46:30,674
Are you sure?

387
00:46:31,174 --> 00:46:32,592
Yeah. Give me your pants.

388
00:46:33,677 --> 00:46:35,095
What about my panties?

389
00:46:35,262 --> 00:46:36,429
No, I didn't say that.

390
00:49:16,506 --> 00:49:17,549
Hello?

391
00:52:41,878 --> 00:52:42,963
No, fuck!

392
00:52:54,891 --> 00:52:56,893
I need you to do something for me.

393
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,270
I'll explain later.

394
00:52:58,436 --> 00:52:59,688
Why not now?

395
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:02,023
It's not easy to explain.

396
00:53:39,102 --> 00:53:40,228
Hello!

397
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

398
00:55:34,759 --> 00:55:36,386
No, wait!

399
00:55:47,188 --> 00:55:48,523
Hey!

400
00:55:48,773 --> 00:55:49,983
Please open the door!

401
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,693
Listen to me a second!

402
00:55:52,027 --> 00:55:55,113
I was in the garden...
This is my house, you know...

403
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,074
and suddenly I saw you with my...
I was far away...

404
00:55:58,241 --> 00:56:00,285
For God's sake, don't call anybody!

405
00:56:00,952 --> 00:56:01,953
Hey!

406
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,602
No, wait!

407
00:56:26,603 --> 00:56:27,604
Wait!

408
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,122
Clara!

409
00:57:06,726 --> 00:57:07,978
Bye!

410
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,106
- I'll have them by the door.
- Okay.

411
00:57:50,061 --> 00:57:54,232
- It sounded like...
- I just heard thunder. You mean that?

412
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:56,735
Yeah. I think so.

413
00:57:58,069 --> 00:57:59,863
Okay, listen. Stay calm.

414
00:58:00,947 --> 00:58:04,451
I'm in another building.
I'll be right over. Stay there.

415
00:58:04,868 --> 00:58:06,244
Okay, thanks.

416
00:58:09,956 --> 00:58:10,957
Hello?

417
00:58:11,124 --> 00:58:12,083
Yes?

418
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,210
- This is Hector 2.
- What?

419
00:58:14,377 --> 00:58:18,089
The second one. Keep your voice down.
Hector might hear us.

420
00:58:18,465 --> 00:58:19,507
Okay, okay.

421
00:58:19,674 --> 00:58:22,510
He left the walkie-talkie
on the table in the basement.

422
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:24,054
All right

423
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,765
I'm the one wearing the bandage.

424
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:28,892
Get him up to the silo.

425
00:58:29,059 --> 00:58:31,269
Make up something.
I'll show up in a car.

426
00:58:31,645 --> 00:58:33,355
- Make up something?
- Hello?

427
00:58:33,605 --> 00:58:35,190
- Yes?
- Did you say something?

428
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:38,443
One second.

429
00:58:38,693 --> 00:58:40,862
Is the man after you
wearing a bandage?

430
00:58:41,071 --> 00:58:42,364
Yeah, a pink one.

431
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:50,473
He'll never think
to look for you in there.

432
00:59:55,061 --> 00:59:56,980
I have to lower the hatch from here.

433
00:59:57,439 --> 00:59:59,566
I'll activate it and get in with you.

434
01:00:15,081 --> 01:00:16,499
Come on!

435
01:00:43,234 --> 01:00:46,446
The man with the bandage,
the pink mummy!

436
01:00:48,531 --> 01:00:51,117
I admit it should have occurred
to me when...

437
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:55,288
Come on.

438
01:00:57,582 --> 01:00:58,875
Where are you going?

439
01:00:59,793 --> 01:01:02,003
To the house.
You need to be examined.

440
01:01:02,879 --> 01:01:05,882
You're the first vertebrate
to ever travel in time.

441
01:01:07,133 --> 01:01:11,304
That bull about surveillance cameras
could have used more preparation...

442
01:01:12,806 --> 01:01:15,642
Surveillance cameras!
We could use some.

443
01:01:23,108 --> 01:01:25,944
- What are you doing?
- I have to get back in!

444
01:01:26,152 --> 01:01:27,237
What?

445
01:01:28,154 --> 01:01:29,698
Something went wrong!

446
01:01:30,615 --> 01:01:33,410
So you want to fix it now?
Forget it!

447
01:01:33,577 --> 01:01:35,203
- Listen to me!
- We'll talk at the house!

448
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:37,205
- Come here!
- Forget it! No way!

449
01:01:43,503 --> 01:01:44,796
What are you doing?

450
01:01:47,966 --> 01:01:49,759
Come back or I'll tear it apart.

451
01:01:51,803 --> 01:01:53,471
Go right ahead.

452
01:01:54,389 --> 01:01:56,516
I'll wait for you at the house.

453
01:02:25,545 --> 01:02:27,839
What are you doing,
trying to ruin me?

454
01:02:28,548 --> 01:02:30,175
After all I...

455
01:02:32,761 --> 01:02:36,097
What else has to happen before
you realize the implications?

456
01:02:36,264 --> 01:02:37,849
I have to do it.

457
01:02:45,941 --> 01:02:47,317
It's not going to happen.

458
01:02:49,736 --> 01:02:50,946
The tank won't work.

459
01:02:51,571 --> 01:02:52,739
Don't lie to me.

460
01:02:52,906 --> 01:02:54,824
Your trip used up all the energy.

461
01:02:55,158 --> 01:02:58,620
It's not easily renewable.
It'll have to be next week,

462
01:02:58,787 --> 01:03:01,081
I don't know... Sorry.

463
01:03:06,878 --> 01:03:08,255
There was something there.

464
01:03:10,131 --> 01:03:11,549
There was, but it's not...

465
01:03:11,841 --> 01:03:13,260
You took it out?

466
01:03:13,426 --> 01:03:14,511
No.

467
01:03:20,225 --> 01:03:21,434
Where is it?

468
01:03:24,062 --> 01:03:25,397
I threw it away outside.

469
01:03:26,064 --> 01:03:27,607
It's one of the batteries.

470
01:03:28,275 --> 01:03:30,235
We can't do anything without it.

471
01:03:57,929 --> 01:03:59,306
Come on.

472
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:06,896
This machine doesn't solve problems.
In fact, it creates them.

473
01:04:07,647 --> 01:04:10,191
I just need a head start
on the other two.

474
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:12,193
I need a previous moment
to be able to...

475
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:16,406
Look, I had activated the machine
seconds before you appeared inside it.

476
01:04:16,573 --> 01:04:18,033
It was turned off before that.

477
01:04:18,283 --> 01:04:22,037
You can't materialize inside a machine
if it's off. It's impossible.

478
01:04:22,203 --> 01:04:24,831
Seconds before?
How many seconds before?

479
01:04:24,998 --> 01:04:29,920
Maybe 30 or 40. You'd have a 30
or 40-second head start. It's absurd.

480
01:04:30,545 --> 01:04:33,506
If you travel into the past
and alter events

481
01:04:33,673 --> 01:04:36,676
and stop Hector 1 from getting
in the tank, there will be 3 of you.

482
01:04:36,843 --> 01:04:40,472
Which will likely cause a chain reaction
of events beyond your control.

483
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:42,307
I won't interfere.

484
01:04:42,766 --> 01:04:46,019
Hector 2 will chase Hector 1
into the tank, like he did before.

485
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:47,604
My change won't affect his plan.

486
01:04:47,771 --> 01:04:50,649
Then there will be 2 of you.
You and Hector 2.

487
01:04:50,815 --> 01:04:53,985
Hector 2 comes up here,
I follow him and finish him off.

488
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,071
We'd be one again.

489
01:04:56,237 --> 01:04:58,323
You have no idea what you're saying.

490
01:05:01,618 --> 01:05:02,953
Hold on.

491
01:05:03,411 --> 01:05:05,580
Why did you throw that thing away?

492
01:05:06,998 --> 01:05:09,542
I can't let you use the machine again.
I'm sorry, I...

493
01:05:09,709 --> 01:05:12,170
No, what I mean is...

494
01:05:12,545 --> 01:05:15,632
You took out the battery
before I said anything, right?

495
01:05:16,341 --> 01:05:17,634
Well, yeah.

496
01:05:19,511 --> 01:05:21,096
Before I showed up.

497
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:24,391
Because I imagined...

498
01:05:26,017 --> 01:05:27,227
One moment.

499
01:05:31,523 --> 01:05:34,234
How did you know I'd want to use
the machine again?

500
01:05:35,902 --> 01:05:37,737
You knew it all along.

501
01:05:38,822 --> 01:05:40,156
Are you tricking me again?

502
01:05:41,825 --> 01:05:43,285
You're tricking me again.

503
01:05:50,709 --> 01:05:51,835
Tell me.

504
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:53,295
Please,

505
01:05:53,461 --> 01:05:54,879
don't make matters worse.

506
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,299
You knew what would happen.

507
01:06:01,803 --> 01:06:02,846
Why?

508
01:06:05,432 --> 01:06:07,058
Because Hector 3 told me.

509
01:06:10,937 --> 01:06:12,147
Hector 3?

510
01:06:14,899 --> 01:06:17,277
Hector 3. The third one.

511
01:06:20,363 --> 01:06:21,740
You're kidding me.

512
01:06:27,871 --> 01:06:30,290
You weren't the first
to appear in the tank.

513
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:33,543
You were the second.

514
01:06:34,878 --> 01:06:38,548
The first had appeared earlier.
He threatened me.

515
01:06:39,883 --> 01:06:41,927
He made me act surprised
to see you.

516
01:06:42,677 --> 01:06:44,387
He made me go along with it

517
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:46,598
He appeared earlier?

518
01:06:47,098 --> 01:06:48,391
How much earlier?

519
01:06:51,478 --> 01:06:53,104
Maybe 30 or 40 seconds.

520
01:06:53,772 --> 01:06:54,814
But...

521
01:06:54,981 --> 01:06:56,358
He left right after you.

522
01:06:57,275 --> 01:06:58,818
I never found out what he wanted.

523
01:06:58,985 --> 01:07:01,988
You've been deceiving me
this whole time.

524
01:07:03,615 --> 01:07:05,867
After leaving the two of you,

525
01:07:06,034 --> 01:07:08,536
I went up to the silo to prepare
for Hector 1's arrival

526
01:07:08,703 --> 01:07:10,872
when suddenly I got a buzz
on the walkie.

527
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,500
It was Hector 1,
calling from the house.

528
01:07:14,042 --> 01:07:17,754
No, much earlier. It was daytime.
It was Hector 3.

529
01:07:18,296 --> 01:07:19,422
Hello?

530
01:07:19,631 --> 01:07:22,050
- This is Hector 3.
- Who?

531
01:07:22,759 --> 01:07:26,388
The last one. Listen to me.
I'm very sorry.

532
01:07:27,764 --> 01:07:28,974
What happened?

533
01:07:29,391 --> 01:07:32,143
I'm afraid everyone will know
what we did.

534
01:07:33,561 --> 01:07:36,231
He seemed out of it, like something
horrible had happened.

535
01:07:37,607 --> 01:07:39,609
He told me everything
that would happen.

536
01:07:40,402 --> 01:07:42,070
That you'd show up here,

537
01:07:42,779 --> 01:07:44,906
trying to go back to the past...

538
01:07:46,658 --> 01:07:50,036
And he didn't say why, but he said
to stop you at all costs.

539
01:07:56,251 --> 01:08:00,380
You'll be Hector 3 if you go through
with it. What I say won't stop you.

540
01:08:00,797 --> 01:08:02,132
Happy?

541
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,551
Wait a minute.

542
01:08:05,802 --> 01:08:08,680
You mean the 2nd trip I'm about to take
was already made?

543
01:08:09,723 --> 01:08:12,809
Apparently you couldn't solve
your little problem.

544
01:08:13,935 --> 01:08:15,937
You told me yourself it failed.

545
01:08:18,982 --> 01:08:20,317
It makes no sense.

546
01:08:21,234 --> 01:08:22,360
Wait.

547
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,780
You say Hector 3 called you
from his walkie.

548
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,033
Yeah.

549
01:08:28,283 --> 01:08:29,326
You mean...

550
01:08:30,994 --> 01:08:32,329
from this walkie.

551
01:08:33,204 --> 01:08:34,372
Yeah.

552
01:08:40,337 --> 01:08:41,838
Shine the light on it.

553
01:08:43,423 --> 01:08:44,799
Over there!

554
01:08:56,811 --> 01:08:58,313
I think this is yours.

555
01:09:00,315 --> 01:09:02,233
All I ask is think it over.

556
01:09:13,453 --> 01:09:15,288
Hector, what happened?

557
01:09:17,582 --> 01:09:19,000
I have no choice.

558
01:11:06,483 --> 01:11:08,068
Calm down and listen to me.

559
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,237
I'm from the future.
Your machine works.

560
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:12,280
- Where...?
- Listen to me.

561
01:11:12,447 --> 01:11:13,990
- How...?
- Listen to me!

562
01:11:14,449 --> 01:11:16,451
Or everyone will know
you turned it on

563
01:11:16,618 --> 01:11:17,869
without authorization.

564
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:19,955
Right now there are 3 of me.

565
01:11:20,205 --> 01:11:23,333
You're going to help me
get rid of the other two.

566
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:25,710
Hector 2 is about to come out
of the tank.

567
01:11:25,961 --> 01:11:27,837
Help him get Hector 1
into the tank.

568
01:11:29,547 --> 01:11:30,799
Hector 2? But...

569
01:11:30,966 --> 01:11:32,300
He'll explain it to you.

570
01:11:34,135 --> 01:11:35,845
- But...
- Stand there.

571
01:12:18,305 --> 01:12:19,514
Calm him down.

572
01:12:20,348 --> 01:12:22,559
I have to reach the house
before you.

573
01:12:23,893 --> 01:12:25,687
Make sure he doesn't see me.

574
01:12:26,104 --> 01:12:28,481
I have to get rid of him,
you got it? Calm him down.

575
01:12:28,773 --> 01:12:30,442
Ask him who he is.

576
01:12:32,444 --> 01:12:34,654
- But who's Hector 1?
- Go!

577
01:13:57,404 --> 01:13:59,030
Shit! You're here!

578
01:13:59,197 --> 01:14:02,742
Keep it down, he might hear you.
I need a remote for the gate.

579
01:14:03,034 --> 01:14:05,537
- In the desk...
- Not for the white car. The others.

580
01:14:06,204 --> 01:14:07,414
There aren't any others.

581
01:14:07,706 --> 01:14:08,873
Then another car.

582
01:14:09,624 --> 01:14:11,126
There's a truck.

583
01:14:14,754 --> 01:14:16,131
The deal's still on, right?

584
01:14:16,381 --> 01:14:19,175
When you get rid of them
you won't say anything, right?

585
01:14:22,554 --> 01:14:25,015
- I told him...
- I know, but he won't listen.

586
01:14:25,265 --> 01:14:26,808
He'll leave at some point.

587
01:14:27,309 --> 01:14:28,685
What are you going to do?

588
01:14:34,983 --> 01:14:36,234
Go after him.

589
01:17:09,054 --> 01:17:10,138
Hello?

590
01:17:11,389 --> 01:17:12,515
Hello?

591
01:17:20,231 --> 01:17:22,400
- This is Hector 3.
- Who?

592
01:17:23,568 --> 01:17:25,070
The last one. Listen to me.

593
01:17:28,698 --> 01:17:30,575
- I'm very sorry.
- What happened?

594
01:17:31,576 --> 01:17:34,454
I'm afraid everyone will know
what we did.

595
01:17:36,289 --> 01:17:40,752
Looks like you bet on the wrong horse.
I'm a failure.

596
01:17:43,255 --> 01:17:44,464
Hector.

597
01:17:44,965 --> 01:17:45,799
Hector?

598
01:17:46,841 --> 01:17:48,510
Where are you?

599
01:17:48,677 --> 01:17:51,429
Why did you have to turn on
the machine?

600
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:55,016
I don't know.

601
01:17:55,976 --> 01:17:58,561
They won't turn it on
for another 6 months.

602
01:17:58,853 --> 01:18:01,022
I won't be authorized to be there.

603
01:18:01,189 --> 01:18:01,982
I guess...

604
01:18:02,357 --> 01:18:05,110
You wanted to take a closer look
beforehand, right?

605
01:18:07,112 --> 01:18:09,906
If you want to keep your job
and your life as you know it,

606
01:18:10,073 --> 01:18:13,243
keep the guy with the bandage
out of the tank at all costs.

607
01:18:13,451 --> 01:18:14,619
Why?

608
01:18:15,787 --> 01:18:19,124
At least that way somebody
will be there to smack you.

609
01:18:38,268 --> 01:18:39,477
What happened?

610
01:18:41,354 --> 01:18:44,232
I think we're both running
from the same person.

611
01:18:44,983 --> 01:18:46,401
He won't find us here.

612
01:18:52,073 --> 01:18:55,535
- His face is bandaged.
- Yeah.

613
01:18:55,702 --> 01:18:57,037
He's up there.

614
01:18:59,247 --> 01:19:00,415
He won't come down here.

615
01:19:01,166 --> 01:19:02,751
Have you got a telephone?

616
01:19:03,835 --> 01:19:05,879
No. Sit here.

617
01:19:19,309 --> 01:19:20,560
Wake up!

618
01:19:23,104 --> 01:19:24,564
There's a house nearby.

619
01:19:26,775 --> 01:19:28,026
Can you get up?

620
01:19:42,582 --> 01:19:43,625
There it is.

621
01:19:54,135 --> 01:19:55,262
Come on.

622
01:19:56,137 --> 01:19:58,723
No, we shouldn't go in that house.

623
01:19:59,557 --> 01:20:00,684
Careful.

624
01:20:12,028 --> 01:20:13,238
Hello?

625
01:20:36,344 --> 01:20:38,013
Wait here, I'll go check.

626
01:21:17,969 --> 01:21:19,012
Hector!

627
01:21:23,224 --> 01:21:24,601
What happened to you?

628
01:21:25,435 --> 01:21:26,645
Nothing.

629
01:21:27,562 --> 01:21:29,064
There's someone outside.

630
01:21:30,148 --> 01:21:32,692
Across the garden.
He broke the fence.

631
01:21:32,943 --> 01:21:34,945
A man with his face covered.

632
01:21:36,112 --> 01:21:37,864
I ran down here to hide

633
01:21:38,198 --> 01:21:40,533
and I heard someone on the stairs.

634
01:21:41,993 --> 01:21:43,662
There's somebody in the house.

635
01:21:43,912 --> 01:21:45,372
I called the police.

636
01:21:52,003 --> 01:21:53,255
What's wrong?

637
01:21:53,505 --> 01:21:55,006
My God.

638
01:21:55,465 --> 01:21:56,466
Hello?

639
01:21:58,301 --> 01:21:59,552
Who is that?

640
01:22:04,474 --> 01:22:05,892
Come with me.

641
01:22:43,096 --> 01:22:44,347
Hector...

642
01:22:44,931 --> 01:22:46,975
Hide in there until I say.

643
01:22:47,183 --> 01:22:48,518
Tell me what's happening!

644
01:22:48,685 --> 01:22:52,856
No matter what you hear,
don't come out. Don't interfere.

645
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:55,150
Please!

646
01:24:08,807 --> 01:24:09,933
Listen.

647
01:24:12,644 --> 01:24:14,104
That guy is crazy.

648
01:24:20,485 --> 01:24:22,821
He saw you from far away
and went nuts.

649
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:26,616
You have to hide from him.

650
01:24:30,453 --> 01:24:31,871
You have to fool him.

651
01:24:42,757 --> 01:24:43,842
Come on.

652
01:24:56,563 --> 01:24:58,440
There's an attic upstairs.

653
01:24:59,149 --> 01:25:00,984
When I say "now, " run upstairs

654
01:25:01,526 --> 01:25:03,320
and lock the door behind you.

655
01:25:12,495 --> 01:25:13,872
You're beautiful.

656
01:25:19,753 --> 01:25:20,754
Now.

657
01:25:26,718 --> 01:25:28,470
No, wait!

658
01:25:34,643 --> 01:25:36,645
Hey! Please open the door!

659
01:25:37,187 --> 01:25:38,688
Listen to me a second!

660
01:25:38,897 --> 01:25:41,691
I was in the garden...
This is my house, you know...

661
01:25:42,067 --> 01:25:43,401
And suddenly I saw you with my...

662
01:25:43,568 --> 01:25:46,071
I was far away...
For God's sake, don't call anybody!

663
01:26:07,634 --> 01:26:08,718
What happened?

664
01:26:09,052 --> 01:26:10,595
Hector, what's going on?

665
01:27:11,197 --> 01:27:12,532
Relax.

666
01:27:26,338 --> 01:27:27,797
Hector...

667
01:27:28,381 --> 01:27:29,174
It's okay.

668
01:27:36,973 --> 01:27:39,851
We still have a while
before it starts raining.
