1
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,008
TWENTY-FOUR DAYS before Christmas

2
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,449
This, is what's been worrying me.

3
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:49,512
Turning sample number 76 from 1300 foot.

4
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:54,364
We finally found something else
than just plain rocks and dirt.

5
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:59,450
Have a look for yourself, sir.

6
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:12,579
Sawdust.. Hmm.

7
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:16,375
At first I thought we drilled into
some old tree or something.

8
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:18,813
But, no.

9
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:24,539
This level of sawdust is 65 foot thick.

10
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:28,653
It doesn't add up, it doesn't make sense.

11
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:32,278
It does.

12
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,006
In the olden days people used to
store ice by encasing it in sawdust.

13
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:44,143
Yea, but what do you mean,
what are you trying to say.

14
00:01:44,177 --> 00:01:47,095
This mountain, it's like a giant icebox.

15
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:50,302
For storing, what?

16
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:54,540
- Drill deeper and you will see.

17
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:57,233
Well, I am..
They're drilling as we speak

18
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:09,884
- Make sure everyone has one of these.
- What are these?

19
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:13,685
It's the new safety instructions.

20
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:15,675
Wash behind the ears.

21
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:18,069
This is funny shit!

22
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,381
Watch your mouth!

23
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:23,101
It's Christmas time.

24
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:25,788
So, let's act like it.

25
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:30,002
KORVATUNTURI mountain drill site

26
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:35,354
Hey, someone's coming.

27
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,518
Mr. Green, I think we found something.

28
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,396
Sample number 98.

29
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:51,560
I think you were right.

30
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:11,986
Always believe, always.

31
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:34,016
Gentlemen, listen up.

32
00:03:34,584 --> 00:03:37,714
My dream, since my early childhood

33
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:42,871
Is about.. to come true.

34
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,970
I can proudly say,

35
00:03:56,451 --> 00:04:00,624
That we are standing on the sacred grave..

36
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:05,313
Biggest burial mound in the world.

37
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,595
Something's been buried here.

38
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,114
This remarkable place puts
even the pyramids to shame.

39
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:20,019
It took the Saami-People of Lapland
centuries to build this mound,

40
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:25,735
You have 24 days to open it.

41
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:31,576
Roll up the sleeves, prepare the dynamite,
do what you do best!

42
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:35,373
They're going to blow up this mountain.

43
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,544
We have a grave to rob.

44
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:43,785
Juuso!

45
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:50,713
Juuso! Wait!

46
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:57,223
Santa's been buried.

47
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:12,221
Juuso! Is Santa Claus dead?

48
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:15,385
Idiot, you still believe in Santa Claus?

49
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:19,166
You're such a little kid. Come on already.

50
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,582
- So they've lied to us this whole time.
- At least to you.

51
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:25,988
What Santa came to our home then?

52
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:29,152
Piiparinen, haven't you realized that?

53
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,949
Piiparinen? Do you think Dad knows?

54
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,430
Your dad pays him for it.

55
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:37,794
Don't you understand, kid?

56
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,958
The whole Santa business is a fraud.

57
00:06:14,753 --> 00:06:17,882
The Truth About Santa Claus.

58
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:22,471
First Santa Claus.

59
00:06:29,438 --> 00:06:32,568
Have you been naughty?

60
00:06:43,957 --> 00:06:47,086
Santa walks barefoot in the snow.

61
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:17,418
Santa making Christmas-Stew.

62
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,211
1 day before Christmas

63
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,483
Pietari!

64
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Wake up! Wake up, son!

65
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:48,838
Pietari! Are you awake?

66
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,149
- Yea, yea.
- Then get up, and get cleaned up!

67
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:05,104
Bad Vuppe. You were supposed to keep watch.

68
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:52,908
Dad!

69
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:55,993
Come here, Dad!

70
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:59,601
Come inside if you have something to say.

71
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:02,380
I don't want to.

72
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:05,914
Then go back in the house.
I don't want you outside alone.

73
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,011
For real! I've got something
important to tell you.

74
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:12,474
For real. Wolves are going to eat you,

75
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:17,021
And I'm not kidding, you hear?

76
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:27,057
Dad, I'm coming.

77
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:30,288
Close your eyes, little man.
Your dad's working.

78
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:43,172
- You shouldn't have turned off the lights.
- Who's going to be looking at them at night?

79
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:49,716
- Were you on the roof?
- Wha?

80
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:52,568
Under my window?

81
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:56,030
Pietari, I'm too busy
to answer stupid questions.

82
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:03,832
- Were you, or not?
- No, I was not there.

83
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,212
Perhaps the chimney sweep?

84
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:09,672
Go get dressed, chop chop.

85
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:12,058
- We've got to go.
- Where?

86
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:14,770
Don't you remember what day it is?

87
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:17,933
Oh, right, it's reindeer round up day.
Am I going too?

88
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:21,397
I'd think you were already dressed.

89
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:41,268
He's spying on us.

90
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:24,062
This is yours now.

91
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:25,904
Is it loaded?

92
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,985
Of course, it's not much use unloaded.

93
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,114
And take off those glasses.

94
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:37,287
Got a light?

95
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,755
Where is your father?

96
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,633
They had to take the snowmobiles,

97
00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:43,461
Piiparinen couldn't get the chopper started.

98
00:13:43,497 --> 00:13:45,048
Everybody off the fence!

99
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:48,177
Three, two, one!

100
00:13:58,565 --> 00:14:01,402
Can you even use that thing, squirt?

101
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:03,453
Of course.

102
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:06,617
- Are you going to shoot Santa Claus?
- He was outside my window yesterday

103
00:14:08,703 --> 00:14:11,831
I thought you said he's dead.
Try to make up your mind.

104
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,004
- Doing some electrical work?
- You like my handiwork?

105
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:19,046
Got to try something,
there's predators about.

106
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:22,673
The explosions are driving them crazy.

107
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:25,183
I wonder what they are looking for.

108
00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:28,437
Some kind of research.

109
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:32,067
Hey, Check it out.

110
00:14:35,697 --> 00:14:38,825
They're coming.

111
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:43,207
Dad! Dad!

112
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,544
They're coming!

113
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,882
Our refrigerators
will soon be filled with meat.

114
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:55,639
Open the gate.
Get out from under foot.

115
00:15:01,197 --> 00:15:03,199
Come! Come in, what are you doing there.

116
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,831
- Two skinny little runts
- Something's wrong

117
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,046
Maybe the others have just lost their way?

118
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:30,268
No, they haven't.

119
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:18,037
Merry Christmas to you.

120
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:24,505
- You stay here.
- Me too?

121
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:26,708
Look after Pietari.

122
00:17:00,877 --> 00:17:04,007
What kind of a wolf makes a mess like this?

123
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,478
A big and fucking nasty one. Look at this.

124
00:17:09,354 --> 00:17:12,483
All because of those idiots
and their explosions.

125
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:16,865
Now we've got Russian wolves here too.

126
00:17:17,491 --> 00:17:20,167
They found the hole.

127
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:23,331
Rauno, it's been cut with forceps.

128
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,885
It's our fault.

129
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,598
Not a word to your father,
or I'll kick your ass!

130
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,761
We never went anywhere near that fence,
remember that.

131
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:43,566
- They deserve to be shot.
- They're probably gone already.

132
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:47,529
They are already gone.
The last few days were very quiet.

133
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:52,620
Fuck, if it wasn't for the border,
I'd kick all their asses.

134
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,719
You've got insurance, right?

135
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:04,489
No, we don't fucking have insurance.

136
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:11,310
Four hundred and thirty three carcasses.

137
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:14,439
Aimo, how much will it cost?

138
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:19,237
About 85 thousand.

139
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:23,911
Plus VAT, twenty two percent.

140
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:34,674
There's our money, rotting away.

141
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:47,817
He was very hungry.

142
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:50,738
So, what do we do now?

143
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,284
Let's go talk to them.

144
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,794
Fuck.

145
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,625
I hear they've paid off the border patrol,

146
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:04,334
To shoot trespassers on sight.

147
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,898
Crossing the border is a big deal.

148
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:09,427
Bankruptcy is also no small thing.

149
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:11,514
Pietari, come on!

150
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:48,562
This is a shitty idea!

151
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:30,200
They left in a hurry.
Fuck!

152
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,270
Come see this!

153
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:11,129
Enlarged area

154
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:14,966
They found him Vuppe.

155
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,838
Seismic research, bullshit.
They've been digging for something.

156
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:29,778
What the hell did they find?

157
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,970
That's the end of that.

158
00:22:26,976 --> 00:22:30,106
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to open it?

159
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:33,066
No.

160
00:22:38,237 --> 00:22:42,410
- Tape these to your butt
- Are you serious?

161
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:49,230
Do I look like I am?

162
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,841
You look, like you're wearing diapers.

163
00:22:52,882 --> 00:22:55,221
So this is why you called me here?

164
00:22:57,308 --> 00:22:59,393
Look at these.

165
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:13,362
The real Santa was a bit different,
the Coca Cola Santa is a fraud.

166
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:17,667
These are from a story book.

167
00:23:17,703 --> 00:23:20,067
This one isn't.

168
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:26,513
- What is this?
- Evidence that some stories are real.

169
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:28,565
And what should I be seeing here?

170
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:30,821
The real Santa..

171
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:34,410
.. Who whips naughty children to death.
Their blood spraying all over..

172
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:37,510
.. Until there's nothing left of them,
not even the bones.

173
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,324
But how did he end up there?

174
00:23:42,784 --> 00:23:44,453
A long time ago,
the Saami-People were angry at him,

175
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:47,582
They lured him onto a frozen lake.

176
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:51,870
When Santa came, the ice broke under him.

177
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:55,274
Santa fell in and the lake froze completely
trapping him.

178
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:59,056
When summer came,
they pulled up a huge ice block,

179
00:24:00,424 --> 00:24:05,656
They then buried it under
several hundred meters of dirt and stones.

180
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:09,259
- And that became known as Korvatunturi.
- Yep.

181
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:15,306
You're such a tool!

182
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,295
- When was the last time you got spanked?
- Dunno. When I was little.

183
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,630
Should we tell them?

184
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:35,247
Listen, kiddo, do you have any idea
what your dad's going to do..

185
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:40,359
When he hears those reindeer died..
because of you?

186
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:10,920
- Are you making gingerbread?
- Are you hungry?

187
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:15,612
Yes.

188
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:50,769
- Did you play hockey?
- No, just playing make-believe.

189
00:25:53,392 --> 00:25:56,522
Must be a rough game.

190
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,157
Yes.

191
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:08,767
These are really good,
just like mother used to make them.

192
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:13,162
Glad to hear that.

193
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:26,757
Dad?

194
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:29,803
What if I didn't exist?

195
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,604
What do you mean?

196
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,483
If I had disappeared.

197
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:43,897
You should disappear... into your bed.
It's already very late.

198
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,684
Dad, do you think I've been nice?

199
00:27:00,147 --> 00:27:04,330
Nice boys are already in bed at this hour.

200
00:27:21,918 --> 00:27:24,547
Merry Christmas, Dad.

201
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:27,720
Merry Christmas, Pietari.

202
00:28:23,061 --> 00:28:26,181
- This is Subzero one.
- Finally!

203
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:30,190
I've tried contacting you a thousand times!
Where are you?

204
00:28:30,784 --> 00:28:33,078
- Is the cargo ready?
- No!

205
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:35,373
We have to cancel the whole operation!

206
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:37,007
It's not what you think!

207
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:40,901
- I repeat. Is the cargo ready?
- Cargo?

208
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:43,007
Don't you understand?

209
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:44,986
It still has a pulse!

210
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,894
Calm down, Mr. Green,

211
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:49,516
Just follow the safety instructions.

212
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:52,229
Fuck your safety instructions!

213
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:55,984
What the fuck?

214
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:05,391
CHRISTMAS

215
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

216
00:29:57,011 --> 00:30:00,140
Stay there, I'll check it out.

217
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:23,393
Do you think this is funny?!
You nearly killed me!

218
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:29,741
You're definitely not going skating!

219
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,853
You're grounded for Christmas.

220
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:34,090
I'm going for a pee.

221
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,080
Come on, Vuppe, let's go out.

222
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:13,780
Dad!.. DAD!

223
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:22,138
- What's wrong?
- The bait's been taken

224
00:31:35,922 --> 00:31:39,803
Carefully now.

225
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,975
Stay there.

226
00:31:49,411 --> 00:31:51,498
Did you hear me?

227
00:31:58,352 --> 00:32:00,439
Don't come any closer.

228
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:19,811
Some bird..

229
00:32:27,901 --> 00:32:29,987
What is it?

230
00:32:30,763 --> 00:32:33,022
There's nothing there.

231
00:32:33,265 --> 00:32:36,395
- Can I take a look then?
- No.

232
00:32:36,604 --> 00:32:39,316
Some kind of a bird snatched the bait.

233
00:32:42,445 --> 00:32:45,573
- I want to see it!
- See what? There's nothing there.

234
00:32:46,492 --> 00:32:49,169
Then why can't I look?

235
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:52,333
Because we haven't even had breakfast yet.

236
00:33:02,196 --> 00:33:05,325
Hey.. We really don't have anything else?

237
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,230
These are fine.

238
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:17,177
If I eat all of these..
Then can I go take a look?

239
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:20,703
Then you take some more.

240
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:29,881
Are you angry at me?

241
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:31,989
No.

242
00:33:35,034 --> 00:33:37,245
You wait here.

243
00:33:37,397 --> 00:33:39,739
Did you hear me?!

244
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,983
You're still grounded.

245
00:33:49,443 --> 00:33:52,713
<i>- What the fuck took you so long?
- Had to get ready for the Santa gig</i>

246
00:33:52,747 --> 00:33:56,817
<i>Follow me and keep your mouth shut.</i>

247
00:33:56,945 --> 00:33:59,031
Vuppe, come on.

248
00:34:35,383 --> 00:34:38,512
Serves him right for trespassing,
god damned.

249
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:08,776
Greene, Brian, Jonathan.

250
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:13,002
Born in -52.

251
00:35:13,664 --> 00:35:16,480
One of those nuts from the mountain.

252
00:35:18,894 --> 00:35:20,979
Under 60 years old.

253
00:35:43,044 --> 00:35:46,172
What are you going to say?

254
00:35:46,707 --> 00:35:49,065
To whom?

255
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:51,719
People.

256
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:56,738
Nothing.

257
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,743
You probably are aware
that wolf pits are illegal..

258
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:03,324
God damn you, Piiparinen!

259
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:07,487
Whether you like it or not,
you're involved in this.

260
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:10,475
- I ought to..
- Be silent,

261
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,469
And think.. If you know how.

262
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:33,410
I have exactly one hour,
before my first Santa gig.

263
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:57,002
Vuppe, stay.

264
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

265
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:32,750
Did you see?

266
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:48,075
He's breathing.
Tough old guy.

267
00:37:57,352 --> 00:37:59,022
What's he doing?

268
00:38:00,596 --> 00:38:02,370
He's scenting something.

269
00:38:11,442 --> 00:38:13,008
Pietari.

270
00:38:16,422 --> 00:38:17,804
Pietari!

271
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,058
I told you to stay inside!

272
00:38:20,093 --> 00:38:23,222
Pietari!
Get back here right now!

273
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:27,852
- Did he see?
- Well, what do you think?

274
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:31,170
Hey, I've gotta get to work.

275
00:38:31,204 --> 00:38:33,298
What do I do with that one?

276
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,385
Chitchat with him.

277
00:38:58,978 --> 00:39:00,647
Shit!

278
00:39:06,215 --> 00:39:13,828
Pietari, Pietari. God damned.
... God damned.

279
00:39:27,347 --> 00:39:29,433
What is he up to?

280
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,475
- Afternoon.
- Hello

281
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:00,682
- What he hell sort of a dress are you wearing?
- What?

282
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:04,062
- Is everything all right?
- What do you mean?

283
00:40:04,506 --> 00:40:06,467
Horrible ghostly figure...

284
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:09,067
.. Been going around town.

285
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:12,161
Strange things have happened.

286
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:16,682
Everything's fine with us,
isn't that right Pietari?

287
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:19,352
Then you're an exception.

288
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:26,012
I see the whole murder squad showed up.

289
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:29,177
- What's messed up here then?
- My side-business.

290
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:32,806
Couple of hundred sacks of potatoes,
the whole harvest.

291
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:35,410
I'm here for potatoes?

292
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,064
Yes!.. And no.

293
00:40:41,402 --> 00:40:43,593
They just took the bags.

294
00:40:47,117 --> 00:40:49,294
Holy hell..

295
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:54,126
Last night nearly every house
got their heaters stolen.

296
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:58,278
Ripped right out of the walls.

297
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:01,740
It's going to be a damn cold Christmas.

298
00:41:02,972 --> 00:41:05,683
Inkeri's hair blower was stolen
from the bathroom.

299
00:41:05,718 --> 00:41:08,402
Who would need all that old crap?

300
00:41:08,645 --> 00:41:13,234
Listen. Our junk
is high tech to the Russians.

301
00:41:14,027 --> 00:41:17,156
- Pietari, shouldn't we be heading home now?
- No.

302
00:41:17,783 --> 00:41:20,912
- Where's Juuso?
- Probably still asleep

303
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,104
Pietari!

304
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:27,260
Not so fast.

305
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:30,111
Let's take a look at your car.

306
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,418
Juuso.

307
00:41:54,393 --> 00:41:57,521
Juuso, wake up. He's at our place now.

308
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,111
Juuso?

309
00:42:13,605 --> 00:42:15,739
Juuso has been taken!

310
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:20,884
- What's this?
- It was in Juuso's bed.

311
00:42:21,011 --> 00:42:23,561
Maybe he's snuck out to see a girl.

312
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:27,456
When I was your age, we used to
make a building out of pillows and..

313
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,315
- Pretended it's...
- He'll probably be home by nightfall.

314
00:42:31,441 --> 00:42:36,934
- You still don't understand?
- Pietari! Nobody wants to listen to your nonsense.

315
00:42:38,972 --> 00:42:42,726
- Now I can go?
- Yes, go.

316
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:49,276
Aimo, you speak English, right?

317
00:42:49,803 --> 00:42:51,580
Why?

318
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:54,848
We need a translator.

319
00:43:30,923 --> 00:43:33,427
Oh shit.

320
00:43:39,301 --> 00:43:43,368
Hello
Old devil.

321
00:44:00,077 --> 00:44:02,477
Gingerbread?

322
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:39,014
So, who am I translating for?
I have other things to do.

323
00:44:40,573 --> 00:44:43,702
We have guests from Korvantunturi.

324
00:44:44,865 --> 00:44:48,963
- What kind of guests?
- American guests.

325
00:45:09,444 --> 00:45:10,821
Get inside now.

326
00:45:12,062 --> 00:45:15,692
- But dad, we have to help Juuso!
- Nonsense, Juuso is a big boy.

327
00:45:19,674 --> 00:45:21,371
Well?

328
00:45:22,337 --> 00:45:25,467
You can not go there, he's not human.

329
00:45:26,146 --> 00:45:28,615
- Not a human?
- Not human!

330
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,780
- He bit me, damned!
- Well, well..

331
00:45:33,448 --> 00:45:36,577
- This I have to see.
- No, really, don't..

332
00:45:48,574 --> 00:45:53,789
Look at that.
There's something about him, something odd.

333
00:45:56,061 --> 00:45:58,982
- Am I right?
- He's foreign..

334
00:46:01,032 --> 00:46:03,118
Go talk to him.

335
00:46:07,555 --> 00:46:09,398
Be careful.

336
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:13,917
How do you like the land
of the Northern Lights?

337
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,577
I'm not going there alone.

338
00:46:29,605 --> 00:46:30,649
Understood.

339
00:46:33,106 --> 00:46:34,984
Cover me.

340
00:46:58,779 --> 00:47:00,866
This does nothing.

341
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:05,416
Wake up, Grandpa!

342
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:07,892
We need money.

343
00:47:08,549 --> 00:47:12,824
Pietari here, hi. Sorry to bother you
on Christmas Eve, but is Hemppa home?

344
00:47:15,027 --> 00:47:19,199
Oh, he isn't... Well, thanks anyway.

345
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:24,008
No, haven't seen.
Oh, and Merry Christmas to you. Bye.

346
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:36,481
Give me the broom.

347
00:47:41,353 --> 00:47:43,071
Where are your friends?

348
00:47:43,618 --> 00:47:46,746
Ask him what they dug out of the mountain.

349
00:47:47,028 --> 00:47:50,156
What did you dig inside the mountain?

350
00:47:55,232 --> 00:47:57,840
Pretending to be deaf; old trick.

351
00:47:57,925 --> 00:48:02,410
Tell him, we're keeping him here
until someone pays.

352
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:07,821
- Like, as a hostage?
- Yes!

353
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:10,089
Explain!

354
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:12,506
We keep you here 'til somebody pay.

355
00:48:12,613 --> 00:48:16,056
- You're going to make him mad!
- He doesn't understand.

356
00:48:16,689 --> 00:48:19,088
This is just the first phase.

357
00:48:23,726 --> 00:48:26,856
Last chance, asshole,

358
00:48:27,926 --> 00:48:32,411
Rauno here will ask the next question;
he don't speak English.

359
00:48:32,862 --> 00:48:35,366
- What the fuck was that?
- Dad!

360
00:48:35,796 --> 00:48:37,689
Oh no, what does he want now?

361
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:40,320
Dad, we need to talk.

362
00:48:49,189 --> 00:48:55,805
Pietari... Piiparinen and I are
in the middle of something. What is it?

363
00:48:57,235 --> 00:48:59,321
Spank me.

364
00:49:00,801 --> 00:49:03,409
- Wha?
- I need to get spanked.

365
00:49:04,035 --> 00:49:07,582
Fifteen good strokes ought to do it.

366
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:11,879
What is wrong with you?

367
00:49:12,854 --> 00:49:14,939
I've been naughty.

368
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:17,809
What have you done?

369
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:21,431
We went to Korvatunturi
even after you told me not to.

370
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:24,604
Juuso and I made the hole in the fence.

371
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:26,046
You did what?

372
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:30,982
I'm the last one.
Everyone else has been taken, Juuso too.

373
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,938
What is this nonsense?

374
00:49:34,115 --> 00:49:36,202
They took all of the children.

375
00:49:37,411 --> 00:49:40,332
Rauno, you gotta see this.

376
00:49:40,888 --> 00:49:43,123
Wait for me here.

377
00:49:50,859 --> 00:49:52,945
He's up to something.

378
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,813
See? He bit through this.

379
00:50:10,062 --> 00:50:12,149
Look at his eyes.

380
00:50:16,331 --> 00:50:18,418
What is he seeing?

381
00:50:22,327 --> 00:50:23,787
Pietari!

382
00:50:26,777 --> 00:50:28,410
No!

383
00:50:28,954 --> 00:50:31,562
Do you know this guy?

384
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:36,488
Looks like he knows you.

385
00:50:37,129 --> 00:50:39,424
He knows all the children in the world.

386
00:50:39,466 --> 00:50:41,999
Who is he? Answer me!

387
00:50:42,029 --> 00:50:44,649
He's been spying on us the whole time.

388
00:50:45,348 --> 00:50:48,442
What do you mean?
Speak up!

389
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:52,030
He's Santa Claus.

390
00:51:05,005 --> 00:51:08,134
He came to get me.
They dug him out at Korvatunturi.

391
00:51:08,558 --> 00:51:13,930
A god damn fantastical creature!
I knew there was something odd about him!

392
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:19,265
- He's coming right for us!
- Dad, don't let him take me!

393
00:51:19,378 --> 00:51:22,903
Get on the ground! Tell him..
Translate it for him!.. Get down on the ground!

394
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:26,597
Down! Down boy!
Go down!

395
00:51:28,248 --> 00:51:30,426
He has his own language.

396
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,169
- He is not afraid of you, Dad!
- Yes, he is

397
00:51:34,272 --> 00:51:35,864
Tie him up.

398
00:51:35,922 --> 00:51:38,299
- I'm not touching it.
- Right now!

399
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,262
What was that?

400
00:52:14,146 --> 00:52:16,545
<i>Subzero One, do you read me?</i>

401
00:52:16,696 --> 00:52:20,884
It's coming from the jacket.
Be careful.

402
00:52:21,682 --> 00:52:24,776
<i>Mr. Green? Is everything okay?</i>

403
00:52:30,182 --> 00:52:33,311
<i>- We are landing in 30 Minutes.
- What did she say?</i>

404
00:52:33,473 --> 00:52:35,768
They want him back.

405
00:52:39,655 --> 00:52:41,757
<i>Mr. Green?</i>

406
00:52:41,837 --> 00:52:43,688
<i>Is Santa ready to fly?</i>

407
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:47,669
- I'm right, aren't I?
- What are you going to do?

408
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:56,431
This is Rauno.
Rauno from Finland.

409
00:53:12,445 --> 00:53:15,257
We have Santa Claus.

410
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:19,719
<i>Who is this?
Where is Mr. Green?</i>

411
00:53:20,057 --> 00:53:24,883
Tell them... that we have Santa for sale.

412
00:53:53,844 --> 00:53:56,250
How much are you going to ask for it?

413
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,406
- Enough to cover my debts.
- At least.

414
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:03,551
- We should think about this.
- Are you afraid?

415
00:54:04,947 --> 00:54:07,454
We're giving it up way too easy.

416
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,857
Think about how much it might cost.

417
00:54:12,601 --> 00:54:15,696
A real Santa Claus.

418
00:54:16,695 --> 00:54:19,824
Someone is going to get rich from it.

419
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:22,428
That's what we're doing.

420
00:54:40,571 --> 00:54:43,700
- Dad!
- Stay here, this won't take long.

421
00:55:09,499 --> 00:55:12,846
- It's Inkeri's hair dryer!
- What the fuck?

422
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,665
Put the fucking thing away,

423
00:55:15,014 --> 00:55:17,329
And try to look like you mean business.

424
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:46,684
Fucking little midget.

425
00:56:01,351 --> 00:56:03,020
Who are you?

426
00:56:03,098 --> 00:56:04,782
Where are my men?

427
00:56:07,818 --> 00:56:11,480
- Say something.
- Yea, yea; we are men.

428
00:56:11,586 --> 00:56:12,946
Let's do business.

429
00:56:13,189 --> 00:56:15,691
Business?
What kind of business?

430
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:17,571
What do you want?

431
00:56:19,982 --> 00:56:23,512
- How much do we want?
-85 thousand.

432
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,679
85 thousand dollars.

433
00:56:31,852 --> 00:56:34,669
- At minimum a million.
- You shut up.

434
00:56:38,465 --> 00:56:41,976
Hey... Where is the cargo?

435
00:57:49,477 --> 00:57:52,188
The last door..

436
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

437
00:58:25,661 --> 00:58:30,325
Shh, put down your weapons and smile..

438
00:58:30,535 --> 00:58:33,737
As nice as you can.

439
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:41,737
Move slowly and do exactly as I say.

440
00:58:42,476 --> 00:58:45,705
- What did he say?
- We need to stay quiet.

441
00:58:46,245 --> 00:58:48,173
This is not Santa.

442
00:58:48,563 --> 00:58:50,118
What?

443
00:58:50,456 --> 00:58:53,483
It's one of Santa's little helpers.

444
00:58:53,922 --> 00:58:58,303
- What... fucking helper?
- He says it's an elf.

445
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:02,457
Enough of that bullshit,
... show me the money!

446
00:59:04,926 --> 00:59:12,542
God damned. Santa is going to
find out who is naughty or nice.

447
00:59:19,949 --> 00:59:21,884
What happened to him?

448
00:59:23,552 --> 00:59:25,238
Is someone there?

449
00:59:28,409 --> 00:59:31,538
What the fuck is that thing
running there?

450
00:59:35,537 --> 00:59:38,366
What the hell is happening here?

451
00:59:38,848 --> 00:59:41,176
They're protecting their master.

452
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:49,277
Pietari!
Pietari!

453
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:00,761
Pietari!

454
01:00:15,374 --> 01:00:18,503
The Elves have built a nest for it.

455
01:00:27,997 --> 01:00:30,324
.. For what?

456
01:00:30,647 --> 01:00:32,695
- Is that..?
- Yes.

457
01:00:35,362 --> 01:00:37,656
They're trying to defrost it.

458
01:00:44,388 --> 01:00:47,518
- Dad.
- Shh, that was that?

459
01:00:47,538 --> 01:00:49,355
Help, Daddy!

460
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:54,155
Juuso. They are all here.
And about to get spanked.

461
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,160
Juuso, where are you?

462
01:01:03,854 --> 01:01:06,982
- Kill the heaters!
- Juuso, say something!

463
01:01:09,186 --> 01:01:13,358
- Piiparinen, the door won't hold!
- What should I do?

464
01:01:14,709 --> 01:01:16,796
Pile stuff at the door!

465
01:01:18,028 --> 01:01:20,763
We need to barricade it!
Hurry!

466
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:23,964
Aimo, leave the brat there
and come help us!

467
01:01:24,244 --> 01:01:25,371
My son.

468
01:01:26,943 --> 01:01:32,438
- Daddy, I want to go home!
- We're all right, we're going home soon.

469
01:01:37,418 --> 01:01:40,212
We're all going to die!

470
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,479
Dad!

471
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,813
Aimo!

472
01:02:03,017 --> 01:02:04,870
Piiparinen!

473
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,679
Listen to me!

474
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:24,823
As long as Santa is here,

475
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:29,598
The elves will not leave kids alone.

476
01:02:29,837 --> 01:02:32,965
It's either me, or Santa;

477
01:02:35,975 --> 01:02:38,477
I suggest Santa.

478
01:03:46,515 --> 01:03:49,997
<i>This is Piiparinen.
Pietari, you read me?</i>

479
01:03:50,142 --> 01:03:52,284
Pietari, read you fine.

480
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,993
<i>- Ready for takeoff.
- Roger.</i>

481
01:04:00,702 --> 01:04:05,999
- Why do I have to be in the sack?
- Because it's my plan! Let's go.

482
01:04:10,863 --> 01:04:14,283
- Here's another one.
- Not Juuso.

483
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:18,799
All of the children must be together,
otherwise this won't work.

484
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:22,878
I'm scared, Dad.

485
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:25,966
Piiparinen!
The package is ready!

486
01:04:30,631 --> 01:04:34,661
- Aren't you going to get cold out there?
- You stay out of this!

487
01:04:37,087 --> 01:04:40,216
Dad, don't worry, everything will be fine!

488
01:04:41,505 --> 01:04:44,009
Cleared for takeoff!

489
01:04:50,149 --> 01:04:54,529
You take care of your part,
I'll take care of this!

490
01:05:40,346 --> 01:05:43,975
Slow down!
We'll wait for them here!

491
01:06:01,218 --> 01:06:04,348
Piiparinen, look down!

492
01:06:13,658 --> 01:06:16,786
I can't believe it, they're following us.

493
01:06:17,246 --> 01:06:19,333
What did I say.

494
01:06:30,004 --> 01:06:33,134
Piiparinen, let's turn back.

495
01:06:33,993 --> 01:06:37,122
- What?
- Let's fly to the corral!

496
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,482
What do you mean?

497
01:06:39,486 --> 01:06:42,031
Pretend they're reindeer!

498
01:06:48,424 --> 01:06:50,418
Reindeer?

499
01:06:50,647 --> 01:06:54,820
Fuck yea!
That's what we're going to do!

500
01:07:27,254 --> 01:07:29,654
I guess we were a bit Naughty.

501
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:40,736
If you ever wondered, Aimo,
how Santa manages to visit thousands..

502
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:44,287
Of places simultaneously,
...this is how.

503
01:07:46,461 --> 01:07:47,818
Magic of Christmas.

504
01:08:22,036 --> 01:08:25,165
Piiparinen, the gate is closed!

505
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:29,706
God damned.
We have to think of something else.

506
01:08:30,017 --> 01:08:32,730
There's no time, I'll open the gate!

507
01:08:33,937 --> 01:08:36,469
You're not going anywhere!

508
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:39,512
I can not land there to pick you back up.

509
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:42,531
I'm not coming back.

510
01:08:43,429 --> 01:08:46,558
<i>Pietari? Do you hear me?</i>

511
01:08:56,318 --> 01:08:58,926
Pietari!

512
01:09:42,587 --> 01:09:44,256
Piiparinen!

513
01:09:46,178 --> 01:09:48,347
Tell Daddy what I did!

514
01:10:18,917 --> 01:10:20,694
Dad..

515
01:10:34,228 --> 01:10:36,418
A peaceful Christmas to all..

516
01:10:47,941 --> 01:10:51,071
And a fucking banging New Year.

517
01:11:15,921 --> 01:11:20,323
<i>Feast your eyes on that, bastards!</i>

518
01:11:20,468 --> 01:11:22,678
What happened?

519
01:11:23,257 --> 01:11:26,465
A Christmas miracle.
Congratulations, Pietari!

520
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:29,974
You just made all the elves unemployed.

521
01:11:44,825 --> 01:11:49,458
Take the kids home,
it's way past their bedtime.

522
01:11:50,208 --> 01:11:53,302
Roger, and out.

523
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:48,837
One hundred and ninety eight Santa Clauses.

524
01:12:49,424 --> 01:12:52,554
Do the math Juuso, how much will it cost?

525
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,285
How much for one?

526
01:13:02,195 --> 01:13:05,248
Eighty-Five thousand.

527
01:13:14,552 --> 01:13:18,412
About 16.800.000, something like that.

528
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:21,691
Plus VAT, twenty two percent.

529
01:13:39,629 --> 01:13:43,279
- You're quite a guy.
- You too.

530
01:13:59,618 --> 01:14:02,748
312 days until Christmas

531
01:14:18,656 --> 01:14:21,786
