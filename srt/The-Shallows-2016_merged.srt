2
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:30,295
Woo hoo!
Woo hoooo!

3
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,948
Whoa!

4
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:47,028
Help me!
Helm me!

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

6
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:11,688
THE SHALLOWS

7
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:40,327
Is that you at the beach?

8
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:42,598
Oh, no, no.
That's my-That's my mom.

9
00:02:42,623 --> 00:02:43,513
Oh.

10
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,925
Yeah, she came to this beach
when she kind of...

11
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,479
she was pregnant with me.
I've never been but...

12
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:49,484
It's kind of our beach.

13
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,617
That's my little sister.

14
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:02,987
Are there more photos?

15
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:05,236
Um. You want to see more photos?
I can...

16
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:11,643
If you look only at the phone,
you're missing what is around you.

17
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:13,550
It's only for your eyes.

18
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,277
Real.
Authentic.

19
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:17,949
You're right.
Thank you.

20
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:21,365
Sorry, I'm American.

21
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:24,190
Not too many gringos here.

22
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:26,701
- Yeah, bummer.
- Thank god.

23
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:37,624
Anna:
I'm not going to make it to the beach,
my head is spinning :(

24
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:39,404
She's not coming.

25
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:40,450
Who?

26
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:42,627
Uh.
My friend, you know.

27
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,896
You know, the girl we
left back at the hotel?

28
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:48,269
You know, she smelled like
Don Julio and bad choices.

29
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,735
She always does this to me.
She just disappears.

30
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,392
She's like the Fantasmo, no?
You know-You know Fantasmo?

31
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,906
- Fantasma. Cuerno.
- Yes, Cuerno.

32
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:59,257
The whole reason I planned
to come on this trip, Cuerno,

33
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:00,905
was to find the secret beach.

34
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,446
And now she's stuck back at
Islas Rocas with an Irish flu.

35
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,877
Nursing a hangover.

36
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:14,217
Yes, hangover.
Major hangover.

37
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:17,174
Nancy:
My professional opinion is to take
2 Advil + Zzz = ☺

38
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,150
You do not like it when someone
change your plan, do you?

39
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:21,276
No, I don't.

40
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:22,608
No, I don't.
It's just...

41
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:24,314
You know, it's not fair.

42
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:26,554
You know why though?
It's because I'm reliable.

43
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:28,329
You know reliable?

44
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,348
Bossy.

45
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:35,835
I am reliable.

46
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:39,656
- Yes, bossy.
- Yes, bossy.

47
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:42,413
That's me.
Very bossy.

48
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:50,986
Anna:
Have fun! We'll catch up later.

49
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:52,735
Did you find the  name
of the secret beach?

50
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,852
Hey, um.
What is this beach called?

51
00:04:58,141 --> 00:05:00,334
You're not going to tell me, cool.

52
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,322
Cool frio.

53
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:03,990
You're tengo frio.

54
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:07,151
Not possible.
It's too hot here.

55
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:09,024
I mean you're cool.
You are being cool.

56
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:11,049
You know what?
It's okay.

57
00:05:11,826 --> 00:05:13,446
American.

58
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,274
Is this the one?

59
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:31,903
Yes.

60
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:15,404
This is paradise.

61
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:18,586
It's perfect.

62
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:30,041
This is the island of
the pregnant woman, no?

63
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,575
The island.

64
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,979
- No.
- Yes.

65
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:38,133
The nose... the breasts...
and her stomach.

66
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:39,361
No.

67
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:43,123
Yes, it is for me.

68
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:04,023
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

69
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,883
- No, no, no, please.
- No, please.

70
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:07,485
- Please. Please, I insist.
- No, no, no.

71
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,062
We were going the same way.
I live close by, so... don't worry.

72
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:13,124
- Oh. Are you sure?
- Yes.

73
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:14,164
Okay.

74
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:16,730
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

75
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:19,040
I'm Nancy.

76
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:20,292
Carlos.
Charlie.

77
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:21,912
- Nice to meet you, Charlie.
- Nice to meet you.

78
00:07:21,937 --> 00:07:26,334
I apologize for my Spanish.
I learned it in... high school.

79
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:27,750
You're in school?

80
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:30,083
No.
I mean I was in medical school.

81
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:32,182
But we didn't have Spanish there,
just cadavers.

82
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:34,223
I'll shut up... now.

83
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,241
Okay.
And dark in a few hours, so...

84
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:39,082
Oh, I never surf at night.

85
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:42,479
And how you...
getting out from here?

86
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:43,902
Uber.

87
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:45,543
Who is Uber?

88
00:07:45,888 --> 00:07:47,410
Never mind.
Thank you, Carlos.

89
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:49,297
Thank you again
for taking me here.

90
00:07:49,322 --> 00:07:51,624
- It means a lot to me.
- Okay.

91
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,263
What did you say the
name of it was again now?

92
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:55,781
I just forgot...
for some reason.

93
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:57,339
Careful.

94
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:59,765
Always.

95
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:19,370
Hey!

96
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:27,471
How are you?

97
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:32,004
Uh.
I can understand only a little.

98
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:35,827
I don't understand.
I'm sorry.

99
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:38,423
He say that it's hard to paddle
when there is a current.

100
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,936
Yeah, I wasn't expecting that.

101
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:43,065
I almost got caught on
the inside coming out.

102
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:46,288
You, American?

103
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:49,376
Yes. Yes, American.
Yeah.

104
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,450
California.

105
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:54,128
Uh.
Close, Texas.

106
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:56,229
You surf in Texas?

107
00:11:56,254 --> 00:12:00,302
Yes, we have surf in Texas.
It's just not like this though.

108
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:09,033
Hey, this is a secret place,
how you find it?

109
00:12:09,058 --> 00:12:11,037
Someone told me about it
a while ago.

110
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:12,506
What's it called?

111
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,686
If I tell you,
I would have to kill you.

112
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:18,362
Well, that would ruin my day.

113
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:21,325
Anything oddly out here
I should know about?

114
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,089
There are some rocks over there.

115
00:12:23,114 --> 00:12:24,530
There's only 1 tide a day.

116
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:27,680
And when the tide gets low,
it becomes an island.

117
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:32,307
There's some nasty fire coral.
It stings like a jellyfish.

118
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:34,421
Okay, thank you.

119
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:45,936
Still have no idea
what you are saying.

120
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:48,326
He says that you should
come over here.

121
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,508
The wave breaks better.

122
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:53,834
Oh, I'm okay-I'm okay.
I'm cool here, thank you.

123
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:55,708
Careful, gringa.

124
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,907
Strong current here for
a little girl from Texas.

125
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:00,959
I think I'll be alright.

126
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,886
Yeah.

127
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:36,775
Yeah!

128
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:09,819
Calling Short Crop

129
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,176
- Short Crop?
- Hey.

130
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:14,424
- Guess where I am.
- Do you wanna?

131
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:17,405
Oh my god.

132
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,195
No way.
Mom's beach, right?

133
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,062
It's just as beautiful as
she said it was.

134
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:24,882
Ah, I wish you were here.

135
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:28,646
- I wish she was here.
- Does that mean you're alone?

136
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,024
Oh, I wasn't gonna come all
this way just to wuss out

137
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:32,919
because I lost my plus one.

138
00:16:32,944 --> 00:16:35,939
That's how you wind up
on Nancy Grace, okay?

139
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:36,980
Excuse me.

140
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:39,369
I am supposed to be the boring,
overprotective sister.

141
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:41,345
You're supposed to be
the fun one.

142
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,570
Sis, the surf here is insane.

143
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:46,315
You would not believe the
perfect tube I just caught.

144
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,432
I can shoot tubes
just as good as you

145
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:50,646
if you would just
take me out!

146
00:16:50,671 --> 00:16:53,735
I'll take you out as
soon as I get back.

147
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,498
I love you, sister mama.

148
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:57,285
- I love you too, Short Crop.
- Is that Nancy?

149
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,884
- It's Dad.
- Just tell him it's all fine, okay?

150
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:00,108
- Uh. No, it's...
- Love you, bye.

151
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:01,492
Hey, Nance, don't hang up.

152
00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:03,797
Give me the phone.
Chloe.

153
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:06,362
- Hey!
- Hey, Papa.

154
00:17:06,387 --> 00:17:08,557
Hey, sweet pea.
Where are you now?

155
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:10,171
Mexico.

156
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:13,189
I don't know what to say, Nance.
I'm at a loss.

157
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:16,222
- I don't-I don't, I can't understand.
- I don't expect you too.

158
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:18,187
- Well, help me out then.
- I don't know.

159
00:17:18,212 --> 00:17:20,123
What do you-
What do you want me to say?

160
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:21,970
Say you are coming back.
Say you are not dropping out

161
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:25,096
of med school after all this time.
After all this work.

162
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:27,562
- You know, just don't quit.
- Okay, Dad, that's enough.

163
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:29,651
Can we just not do this
right now, please?

164
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:31,582
But, that's what you love.
You help people.

165
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:34,545
Well, not everyone can be helped, Dad.
You know that.

166
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,975
Don't do that.

167
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:40,324
- Don't make this about her.
- What else would it be about?

168
00:17:41,983 --> 00:17:44,921
If you want to make this about her,
then you stink in it.

169
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:46,813
She was a fighter.

170
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:53,427
It's just too far,
too hard, Dad.

171
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,344
You know.
And for what?

172
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:59,931
It all ended the same.

173
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:04,540
Just come back, Nancy.
Please.

174
00:18:05,857 --> 00:18:07,569
I got to go, okay?
I'll see you soon.

175
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:10,012
When?
When?

176
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:11,918
- I don't know.
- Nance.

177
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,419
I love you, bye.

178
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:39,261
Anna:
Meeting up with the cute guy from last
night... Don't wait up for me.

179
00:19:30,189 --> 00:19:33,218
Yeah, girl.
It's getting late, let's go in.

180
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:37,170
- I'm gonna catch one last one, thanks.
- Okay.

181
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:39,055
Nice meeting you guys.

182
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,382
Farewell.
(Buenas noches.)

183
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

184
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000

187
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:58,047

00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:03,699
Help me!
Help me!

190
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:06,080
I'm here!

191
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,480
I'm right here!
Help!

192
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:16,701
Yes.
Yeah.

193
00:26:16,726 --> 00:26:18,112
Here!

194
00:26:18,406 --> 00:26:20,318
Here!
Here!

195
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,503
No!

196
00:26:28,972 --> 00:26:32,388
Help!
Please help me!

197
00:26:33,948 --> 00:26:35,612
Help!

198
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,814
COME BACKKKKK !!!

199
00:26:50,445 --> 00:26:51,837
Oh god.

200
00:26:57,861 --> 00:26:59,771
Where are you taking me?

201
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:38,504
Too far.

202
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:18,748
Okay.
Okay.

203
00:30:40,175 --> 00:30:42,618
You are not going to
feel a thing, ma'am.

204
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:47,324
Just put some Novocaine
injections to numb the area.

205
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:51,247
So, you're just going to
feel a little pressure, but...

206
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:54,081
You're not going to
feel the stitches, okay?

207
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:55,975
Okay?

208
00:30:59,197 --> 00:31:03,178
Ahhhhh!

209
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:10,678
Tie up the suture.

210
00:31:11,422 --> 00:31:14,513
That's right.
That's a nice union.

211
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:19,809
One more and then
we'll send you on your way.

212
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:22,327
Here we go.

213
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:48,147
Okay.

214
00:31:51,764 --> 00:31:54,770
Okay, ma'am.
Nice clean wrap.

215
00:32:07,276 --> 00:32:09,354
Get in line, buddy.

216
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:13,571
Just keep it elevated, ma'am.

217
00:32:13,595 --> 00:32:15,436
Someone's coming.

218
00:32:15,461 --> 00:32:17,660
Okay.
Okay.

219
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,472
You're going to be fine.

220
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,925
5 HOURS
TO LOW TIDE

221
00:34:49,386 --> 00:34:50,988
There we go.

222
00:35:18,422 --> 00:35:20,767
I got to get some
blood flowing.

223
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:23,572
Now, let's loosen this
tourniquet for you.

224
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:42,798
God.
Come on.

225
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,737
There we go.
There we go.

226
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:51,708
Okay.
Okay.

227
00:35:57,584 --> 00:36:00,594
Okay, you get 2 minutes
of blood flow.

228
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,021
LOW TIDE

229
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:05,540
Okay.

230
00:36:05,752 --> 00:36:07,212
Okay.

231
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:12,926
Compression bandage.

232
00:37:30,986 --> 00:37:32,396
Eww.

233
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:18,085
You still out there?

234
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:37,635
Stay.

235
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:39,986
Good bird.

236
00:40:06,441 --> 00:40:08,118
Aahhh!

237
00:40:57,475 --> 00:40:59,558
Hello!

238
00:41:02,637 --> 00:41:05,156
Hey !!!

239
00:41:24,437 --> 00:41:26,269
Yeah.
Yeah.

240
00:41:28,024 --> 00:41:29,907
Hello!

241
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,385

247
00:42:02,643 --> 00:42:04,802
My backpack.
My backpack!

248
00:42:04,827 --> 00:42:06,400
It's over there.

249
00:42:07,585 --> 00:42:10,189
Yes! Yes!

250
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:13,952

00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:35,555
Inside, the teléfono.

254
00:42:44,927 --> 00:42:48,340
Telephone, please hurry!

255
00:43:05,702 --> 00:43:08,328

256
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,943
Hurry!

257
00:43:16,649 --> 00:43:19,196
No.
No, no, no.

258
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,634
No!

259
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:25,584

260
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:30,055
Come back, you can have it!
You can have it, come back!

261
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,210
Come back, please!
Please, help me!

262
00:43:37,565 --> 00:43:40,073
Please, help me!

263
00:43:54,818 --> 00:43:56,131
No.

264
00:43:59,466 --> 00:44:01,743
No, there's a shark!

265
00:44:04,015 --> 00:44:06,816
Wait, it's okay.
Just don't go!

266
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:08,831
No, there's a shark!

267
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:10,525
Stop!

268
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,531
No!

269
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,380
Shark!

270
00:46:03,295 --> 00:46:04,882
Shut up.

271
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,511
Shut up.

272
00:46:59,877 --> 00:47:01,728
Stop!

273
00:47:01,753 --> 00:47:04,221
Stop!
Get out of the water!

274
00:47:04,246 --> 00:47:07,376
Get out of the water!
Get out!

275
00:47:07,401 --> 00:47:09,140
Stop!

276
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:14,118
Go back!

277
00:47:14,143 --> 00:47:15,858
Shark!

278
00:47:15,884 --> 00:47:19,506
Don't worry about it.
There're no sharks here.

279
00:47:19,531 --> 00:47:23,136
Stop!
Stop!

280
00:47:23,161 --> 00:47:26,373
Get out of the water!
Get out!

281
00:47:26,398 --> 00:47:28,602
Go back, get help!

Come on! Come on!

287
00:48:10,919 --> 00:48:12,216
Come on!

288
00:48:13,965 --> 00:48:15,652
Come on, I got you!

289
00:48:15,677 --> 00:48:17,514
I got you.
Come on. Come on.

290
00:48:17,539 --> 00:48:18,833
Come on!

291
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

292
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Help!

Help me.

293
00:49:00,462 --> 00:49:02,713

294
00:49:02,738 --> 00:49:04,747
- Help me!
- I got you, come on!

295
00:49:04,772 --> 00:49:06,916
- Help!
- I got you. I got you.

296
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:08,259
I got you.

297
00:49:39,148 --> 00:49:42,394
3 HOURS
TO HIGH TIDE

298
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:34,150
25 MINUTES
TO HIGH TIDE

299
00:51:29,028 --> 00:51:30,522
Come on.

300
00:51:34,866 --> 00:51:36,238
Come on.

301
00:51:38,824 --> 00:51:40,364
Come on.

302
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:49,674
You're okay.
I'm not bailing you, little buddy.

303
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:52,076
Let me see you.

304
00:51:52,101 --> 00:51:53,303
I'm not very good
at wrought though.

305
00:51:53,328 --> 00:51:56,410
But it just looks
like a dislocation.

306
00:51:57,104 --> 00:51:59,288
Like a separated shoulder.

307
00:51:59,922 --> 00:52:01,986
I think it's the same.

308
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:04,167
We'll see, uh.

309
00:52:04,192 --> 00:52:06,670
I'm just going to
do this quick, okay?

310
00:52:06,695 --> 00:52:08,981
It's gonna hurt
just for a second,

311
00:52:09,006 --> 00:52:11,235
and then you're gonna be okay.

312
00:52:11,945 --> 00:52:14,923
On three.
Ready?

313
00:52:15,862 --> 00:52:17,747
One.

314
00:52:17,772 --> 00:52:19,250
Two.

315
00:52:19,275 --> 00:52:20,587
Three.

316
00:52:21,709 --> 00:52:23,601
I think we did it.

317
00:52:24,026 --> 00:52:25,656
Hey. Hey. Hey.

318
00:52:25,681 --> 00:52:28,371
That's a terrible way
to say thank you.

319
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:32,417
Now you got a chance, huh?

320
00:52:36,712 --> 00:52:39,883
Huh.
And here comes the tide.

321
00:52:45,364 --> 00:52:46,848
Camera.

322
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:09,024
That's the third time.
I got you.

323
00:53:09,605 --> 00:53:12,920
32 seconds from
the whale to the rock.

324
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

325
00:55:53,668 --> 00:55:56,620
Woo hoo!
Woo hoooo!

326
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,157
Whoa!

327
00:56:09,285 --> 00:56:11,814
Help!
Help!

328
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:14,518
- Come on, I got you!
- Help!

329
00:56:14,543 --> 00:56:17,066
I got you! I got you!
I got you!

330
00:56:17,091 --> 00:56:18,453
Come on.

331
00:56:18,919 --> 00:56:20,304
Hold on.

332
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:42,250
Huh.
Someone got you.

333
00:56:50,169 --> 00:56:52,933
30 or 40 yards.

334
00:56:54,488 --> 00:56:56,719
1 minute swim.

335
00:57:01,766 --> 00:57:03,759
I can make that.

336
00:57:06,913 --> 00:57:08,976
I need a head start.

337
00:57:35,342 --> 00:57:37,970
10 MINUTES
TO HIGH TIDE

338
00:57:42,188 --> 00:57:46,182
This is Nancy Adams.
It's April 26th, 2016.

339
00:57:46,207 --> 00:57:48,423
If you find this,
please send help right away.

340
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:50,045
I've been attacked by a shark.

341
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,835
He's killed 3 other people
since I got here.

342
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,556
He's still circling so, um...

343
00:57:54,581 --> 00:57:57,262
He's got this,
big old whale over here.

344
00:57:57,287 --> 00:57:58,447
But, that's the problem.

345
00:57:58,472 --> 00:58:00,510
I swam right up on
his feeding ground.

346
00:58:00,535 --> 00:58:03,472
I've been bitten
pretty deeply into my...

347
00:58:03,511 --> 00:58:05,634
my gastroc and quad muscles.

348
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:09,276
I have a deep gash running
vertically down my medial thigh.

349
00:58:09,301 --> 00:58:11,624
and it turns lateral
just above my knee.

350
00:58:11,649 --> 00:58:15,858
And right here, there's one rend
across my-my posterior calf.

351
00:58:15,882 --> 00:58:19,343
I'm losing a lot of blood.
Gangrene is setting in.

352
00:58:19,368 --> 00:58:22,079
I feel like I'm losing
my strength.

353
00:58:22,104 --> 00:58:23,470
I don't think 
I have much time.

354
00:58:23,495 --> 00:58:28,554
The island I'm on is going to be 
taken by the tide in a few minutes.

355
00:58:28,579 --> 00:58:32,478
I'm about 200 yards off the shore,
of this beach.

356
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,433
I never found out
what it was called.

357
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,220
So...

358
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,756
Um.

359
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,599
This is useless.

360
00:58:51,419 --> 00:58:54,984
There's a buoy, which
I'm going to try to swim to.

361
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:58,202
About 30 or 40 yards away.

362
00:59:00,696 --> 00:59:03,196
See here.
That's...

363
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:06,959
That's the plan.
Um...

364
00:59:12,067 --> 00:59:14,422
If you find this,
can you just um...

365
00:59:14,447 --> 00:59:17,608
Can you just delete 
that first part and...

366
00:59:18,153 --> 00:59:19,617
And send it to...

367
00:59:19,642 --> 00:59:25,659
10231 Oliver Crescent Drive,
Galveston, Texas.

368
00:59:25,684 --> 00:59:27,560
That's my home.
That's-That's where my...

369
00:59:27,585 --> 00:59:29,640
That's where my dad
and sister live.

370
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:48,321
Hey, Pop. 
Hey, Chloe.

371
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,032
Um.

372
00:59:51,605 --> 00:59:54,342
I finally got that alone time.

373
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,103
Super overrated.

374
00:59:58,218 --> 00:59:59,471
Um.

375
00:59:59,788 --> 01:00:02,021
You know, I'm not-
I'm not totally alone.

376
01:00:02,046 --> 01:00:05,881
I've got this little dude, Steven Seagull,
here keeping me company.

377
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:07,538
Show them your wing.

378
01:00:07,922 --> 01:00:10,150
I fixed him for you, Chloe.

379
01:00:13,096 --> 01:00:17,169
I just don't want you guys to worry
and I don't want you to feel...

380
01:00:18,528 --> 01:00:20,880
You know bad or anything,
'cause...

381
01:00:21,103 --> 01:00:23,264
I love you so much.

382
01:00:23,574 --> 01:00:25,997
And I miss you 
more than I ever...

383
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:28,747
I ever realized I could.

384
01:00:29,605 --> 01:00:32,115
Dad, I got to get off 
this rock soon.

385
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:33,475
Um.

386
01:00:34,275 --> 01:00:36,757
But I want you to know 
I'm going to fight.

387
01:00:38,131 --> 01:00:39,594
I am.

388
01:00:39,834 --> 01:00:42,206
Just like she taught us.

389
01:00:42,529 --> 01:00:43,958
And you were right.

390
01:00:57,341 --> 01:00:59,220
I love you.

391
01:01:00,372 --> 01:01:02,918
I love you so much.

392
01:01:13,749 --> 01:01:15,496
Time to go.

393
01:01:48,947 --> 01:01:50,495
It's okay. It's okay. 
You got it.

394
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,977
Good job.

395
01:01:56,688 --> 01:01:58,990
You're gonna make it, buddy.

396
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,349
You're okay.

397
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:22,244
Okay.
Okay.

398
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,039
Shit.

399
01:03:05,301 --> 01:03:07,087
Oh, you're kidding me.

400
01:03:10,196 --> 01:03:11,453
Huh!

401
01:03:16,007 --> 01:03:19,486
You didn't like that,
because it stings like jellyfish.

402
01:03:35,547 --> 01:03:37,797
This is my head start.

403
01:07:05,725 --> 01:07:07,134
Come on.

404
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:08,869
Come on.

405
01:07:35,897 --> 01:07:37,199
Okay.

406
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,272
No, no, no.
Come back.

407
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:53,098
Come back.

408
01:08:54,452 --> 01:08:55,866
Come back.

409
01:08:56,277 --> 01:08:57,763
Come back.

410
01:09:01,231 --> 01:09:02,637
Come on.

411
01:09:16,937 --> 01:09:18,453
Come back.

412
01:10:25,878 --> 01:10:29,927
This is Nancy Adams.
It's April 26th, 2016.

413
01:10:29,952 --> 01:10:32,336
If you find this,
please send help right away.

414
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,103
I've been attacked by a shark.

415
01:10:34,128 --> 01:10:36,530
He's killed 3 other people
since I got here.

416
01:10:36,555 --> 01:10:38,150
I'm losing a lot of blood.

417
01:10:38,175 --> 01:10:41,123
I feel that I'm
losing my strength.

418
01:10:43,426 --> 01:10:44,894
I love you more, Short Crop.

419
01:10:44,919 --> 01:10:46,417
I'll be home soon.

420
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:47,587
Magical beach.

421
01:10:47,612 --> 01:10:49,436
No way.
Mom's beach, right?

422
01:10:49,461 --> 01:10:51,084
Not everyone can be helped.

423
01:10:51,109 --> 01:10:54,031
I don't want you to feel...
You know bad or anything.

424
01:10:54,056 --> 01:10:55,410
I got to go, okay?
I'll see you soon.

425
01:10:55,435 --> 01:10:56,751
Hey, sweet pea.

426
01:10:57,012 --> 01:10:58,446
She was a fighter.

427
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm going to fight.
Just like she taught us.

428
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:14,957
Uh-uh.

429
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:36,753
No!

430
01:12:01,106 --> 01:12:02,933
Where are you?

431
01:12:12,224 --> 01:12:13,993
Fuck you.

432
01:12:30,243 --> 01:12:31,807
Oh shit!

433
01:12:37,185 --> 01:12:38,728
No!

434
01:12:46,902 --> 01:12:48,342
No!

435
01:13:00,628 --> 01:13:01,871
Ow!

436
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

437
01:15:49,392 --> 01:15:51,594
- Miguel!
- Here. Here's the place.

438
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:52,902
Here.

439
01:16:07,516 --> 01:16:11,297
Papa! Papa!
Look at the water!

440
01:16:17,074 --> 01:16:18,377
What?
Where, son?

441
01:16:18,402 --> 01:16:21,177
There. There.
Look. There.

442
01:16:22,526 --> 01:16:23,780
Go quickly.

443
01:16:47,082 --> 01:16:48,695
Run!
Call for help!

444
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,477
Hurry!
Hurry!

445
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,480
Relax. 
Relax.

446
01:17:26,505 --> 01:17:29,294
Breathe. 
Breathe.

447
01:18:45,571 --> 01:18:47,280
I'm okay.

448
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:54,789
