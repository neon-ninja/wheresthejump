1
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,250
We are not professing
to tell you

2
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:54,086
the complete story
of these activities.

3
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:57,656
We are professing to tell you the
complete story that we know.

4
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:01,160
But these records that we've
uncovered don't tell the story.

5
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:02,628
They tell pieces of it.

6
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:08,700
They were looking
for fundamental information

7
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:11,236
on compounds that were...

8
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,572
would be capable
of causing...

9
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,477
changes in behavior,

10
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,346
changes in mental attitude.

11
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,881
Did you ever consider

12
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,217
what would have happened
if any of these substances

13
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,519
were given to, say,
unwitting people?

14
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,155
Testing it out
on an American citizen?

15
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,158
I...

16
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:43,202
I guess I must seem very,
very cold-blooded about this,

17
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:47,039
but I don't recall
ever having been

18
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,141
very much preoccupied

19
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:51,376
with that, uh--
with that issue.

20
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,313
Thousands of
government-sponsored experiments

21
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:57,282
did take place at hospitals,
universities,

22
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,585
and military bases
around our nation.

23
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:03,222
Some were unethical,
not only by today's standards,

24
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:05,491
but by the standards
of the time

25
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,326
in which they were conducted.

26
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:09,761
Between the injection and the effects,

27
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:13,599
the patient was
transported to whatever

28
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,801
or wherever it is
that DMT leads people.

29
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:20,305
When the Freedom of Information Act
released a bunch of documents,

30
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,808
you found out that all
these different subjects

31
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,576
that had taken
this chemical

32
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:28,647
all experienced the same
phenomena under the drug.

33
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,716
They experienced
something out there

34
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,585
that came to them,
that met them halfway.

35
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,354
But what
you can't lose sight of

36
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,622
is what all of this
would mean

37
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,891
in terms
of individual human beings.

38
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,392
There would be deaths,

39
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,995
there would be long-lasting
and harmful effects.

40
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,531
Everyone who
took this chemical saw

41
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:48,400
and witnessed
the same thing,

42
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,202
and they all named it
the same thing,

43
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:52,404
even though they
were separate subjects.

44
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,273
What'd they, uh...
What'd they name it?

45
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:57,009
Well, that's actually
the name of the chapter.

46
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,745
These entities were kind
of malignant and threatening.

47
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,647
And, actually, a handful
of the volunteers

48
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:05,184
had traumatic and terrible
encounters with these entities.

49
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,419
Nobody should have
to go through this.

50
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:11,423
The United States of America
offers a sincere apology

51
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,192
to those
of our citizens

52
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:16,161
who were subjected
to these experiments,

53
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,463
to their families,
and to their communities.

54
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,633
It's something that
I think the general public

55
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,669
has no idea that
our government was doing

56
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,505
and could really open up
some--some eyes.

57
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,006
And would you ever, uh...

58
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,442
Would you
ever try the chemical?

59
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,644
Uh, that's a big question,
isn't it?

60
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,580
That's the million dollar
question.

61
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,189
James Hirsch
was a close friend of mine.

62
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,825
We graduated together
from Atticus University.

63
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,894
We both took
writing courses together,

64
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:52,297
and we'd often work
on stories late into the night.

65
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,333
We wasted countless hours
at the bar

66
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:57,135
arguing about
political philosophy and movies.

67
00:03:57,137 --> 00:04:02,107
But four years later,
my friend James went missing.

68
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,713
All right, it's on.

69
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:10,015
Now what do you want me
to do with it?

70
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,017
Just, um...

71
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,620
I don't trust myself to take accurate
notes while I'm on the chemical,

72
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:18,357
so I'm gonna ingest it, and
you're going to record.

73
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,825
Okay.

74
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,893
Okay.

75
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,868
Hello. My name is James,

76
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,039
and this little guy
is 150 milligrams

77
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,743
of specially enhanced
Dimethyltryptamine, DMT 19.

78
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:41,747
It's supposedly impossible
to find, but here I have it.

79
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:46,084
Well, where'd you get it?
Some friends in Colorado.

80
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,799
Oh, uh, FYI, Renny,

81
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:05,470
if this little chemistry
experiment goes sideways,

82
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,373
I want you to finish my
book and dedicate it to me.

83
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,210
Okay.
Be a terrible book.

84
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,846
Might be
a terrible book anyway.

85
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,720
We're not actually doing
anything illegal here.

86
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:25,457
Whoa, you look so weird, dude.
Shut up.

87
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,458
No, just kidding.
You look the same.

88
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,731
Do you feel anything?
No?

89
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,739
No, I don't feel
anything yet.

90
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,307
Hey, I don't
want to see myself

91
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,376
doing some weird drug
on YouTube.

92
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,244
Well, if you do
anything remotely funny,

93
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,546
I might actually save it.

94
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,681
Don't fuck
with me, Renny.

95
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,486
So if nothing happens,

96
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,522
are you gonna just make
something up for your book?

97
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,863
Wait. Do you--

98
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,332
What is that?

99
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,568
Do you hear that?

100
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,903
That radio?

101
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,976
Where's it coming from?

102
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,145
It's like interference.

103
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,281
What is that?

104
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,482
Wait.

105
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,958
What if it's coming from
something in the house?

106
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,815
Do you think
someone's here?

107
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,465
I don't like this.
We should call someone.

108
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,066
I ingested the chemical,
remember?

109
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,434
I took that. We don't...

110
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,471
Oh, fuck, Renny.

111
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:53,705
What?

112
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,508
It's coming
towards the house.

113
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,111
What is?
I don't know.

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What is this?!

115
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,058
What do you
want me to do?

116
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,861
This...

117
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,262
Help!

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

119
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,028
Look, you think maybe he
was having some kind of spasm,

120
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,097
some kind of reaction
to the drug he took?

121
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,698
Look, no. It wasn't...

122
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,166
Can you recall
making any movements

123
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,135
to strike or push him
when he was convulsing?

124
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,303
Is that
how it happened?

125
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:01,506
No, I--
No. I just ran.

126
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,875
I don't know what happened...
And you didn't take the drug?

127
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,477
No, I didn't.
Are you sure?

128
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,178
I didn't take
the chemical!

129
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,349
James and I didn't see
each other much after college.

130
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,751
True to both our words,

131
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:15,086
he struggled as a young,
but talented novelist.

132
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,856
I got into journalism
at an online news site.

133
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,559
Occasionally, we'd drop
each other an email

134
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,161
just to check in.

135
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,797
No one could tell me exactly
what had happened to James

136
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,966
because no one knew.

137
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,235
Nevada law enforcement
officials suspected

138
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,971
he'd been murdered
by his friend, Renny Seegan,

139
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,073
after James ingested
an enhanced form

140
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:39,911
of a rare contraband chemical
known as Dimethyltryptamine.

141
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,413
I been real nice
up to now,

142
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,615
but I'm gonna--
I'm gonna fuck your world, kid.

143
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,816
Have you seen
the kind of boys

144
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,351
we got down there
in the county lockup?

145
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,852
I'm gonna put you in there
with those son of a bitches.

146
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,788
I didn't do--
I didn't do anything.

147
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,890
Fresh piece
of fucking chicken!

148
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,992
All I know is
he said it was

149
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,061
from some friends
in Colorado.

150
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,162
God.

151
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,530
Oh, yeah.

152
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,131
I hear that every
time...friends.

153
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,033
What kind of friend
gives you poison?

154
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,269
Without a body,
police weren't ready

155
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,771
to charge Renny Seegan
with any crime.

156
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,107
They would never
get the chance.

157
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,776
Renny vanished
almost 72 hours later.

158
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,179
He was never seen again.

159
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,850
I decided that James and I
would work

160
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,986
on one last project
together.

161
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:24,756
We would find out the truth
about what happened to him.

162
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,392
It would be
our final collaboration.

163
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,626
"James, I expect you'll find this batch
"will help immensely with your research.

164
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,062
"It wasn't easy to come by, "but
then again, nothing worth doing is,

165
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:48,166
"so I expect a full report "when
you come out on the other side.

166
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:51,803
Sincerely,
your friends in Colorado."

167
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,513
James,
what happened to you?

168
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

169
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,946
Hello?

170
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,086
Hello?

171
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,399
Henry Cale?
Yes.

172
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:32,203
We spoke on the phone.
Hi. I'm Anne Roland.

173
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,040
So tell me everything you know
about shortwave radio broadcasts.

174
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,276
Yeah. Well, I'm an operator
and enthusiast,

175
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,645
and I've been working with it all my life.
Come here.

176
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,122
I don't like this.

177
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,523
We should call someone.

178
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,125
I ingested
the chemical, remember?

179
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,627
I took that. We don't...

180
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:59,898
- Oh, fuck, Renny.
- What?

181
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,533
It's coming
towards the house.

182
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,005
Yeah, that sound
on the radio

183
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,042
sounds exactly like one
of the known numbers stations.

184
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,477
Numbers stations?

185
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,949
Numbers stations are shortwave radio
stations of unidentified origin.

186
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:21,552
They generally broadcast
artificially generated voices

187
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:25,290
reading streams of numbers,
words, letters,

188
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:29,127
backwards music,
or cryptic electronic code.

189
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,529
They're in a wide variety
of languages,

190
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:35,767
and the voices are usually
female for some reason.

191
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,270
Sometimes it sounds
like a child.

192
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,472
And how long have you been
hearing them for?

193
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,174
Well, the shortwave
community's

194
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,943
been finding them
for decades now.

195
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,744
Listen.

196
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:53,584
7, 5, 4, 6, 8.

197
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:03,394
8, 7, 7, 6, 5.

198
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,417
Who would broadcast that?

199
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,153
Lot of theories--
secret government agencies,

200
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,955
terrorists, drug runners.

201
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,024
But it's never
been shown for sure

202
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,959
who or what
is broadcasting them.

203
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:38,363
So you've been keeping track
of these numbers stations

204
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,931
and documenting them
for years?

205
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,532
That's right.

206
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,701
And you've heard that
particular broadcast before?

207
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,370
Yes, I have.

208
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,408
The signal sounded like a
broadcast from this small area

209
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,710
we call the Lonely
Traveler Station.

210
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,545
The Lonely Traveler?

211
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,147
Yeah. Shortwave radio guys
named it that.

212
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,882
I've heard recordings,

213
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:01,452
but I've never gone out there
to listen to it myself.

214
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:04,622
Well, James's cabin
is right about here,

215
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,657
same area upstate.

216
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,627
So what do I need to do if I
wanted to record this broadcast?

217
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,129
Well, it's not easy.

218
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:14,365
You'd need to be out on the far
edge of the Black Rock Desert

219
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,234
between 3:00 to 5:00
in the morning,

220
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,669
and maybe
cross your fingers.

221
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,204
That's it?

222
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,939
Doesn't sound so bad.

223
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,074
Yeah, that's it.

224
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,543
I can give you
one of our receivers.

225
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,744
One more question.

226
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,614
Did you--Did you used
to work for the NSA?

227
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:32,617
Excuse me?
You know, the NSA.

228
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,819
You worked for them
as a code breaker.

229
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,788
Why do you say that?

230
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,158
Well, according to the NSA
employment verification contact,

231
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,063
Henry Cale worked there
from 1963 to 1979.

232
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,632
I wouldn't care
to discuss that.

233
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,558
So, out here
in the middle of nowhere,

234
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,128
75 miles
from the nearest town,

235
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,264
on the outskirts
of the Black Rock Desert...

236
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:27,538
Listening, watching
for the Lonely Traveler.

237
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,407
Happy times.

238
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,401
James was
more than a friend.

239
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:05,443
Sometimes I find myself asking,
were you in love with him?

240
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:11,149
I guess I never really
thought of it until he was gone.

241
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:50,254
The signal
is getting stronger.

242
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,492
That's weird.

243
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,006
Is anyone out here?

244
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

245
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,839
Fuck, they're watching.

246
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,547
You need to
be more careful, Anne.

247
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,049
You don't know
who's out there.

248
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,585
With that substance,
do you know who or what

249
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:29,120
James might have been
involved with?

250
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,721
Well, there was this strange
message sent from someone,

251
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,257
I think sent
from his supplier.

252
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,625
They didn't sign it
with a name,

253
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,494
but they signed it
"your friends in Colorado,"

254
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,728
which is exactly
the same thing

255
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,196
that Renny Seegan
said on the police tape.

256
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,998
Oh, "friends
in Colorado."

257
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,767
Yeah, "friends
in Colorado."

258
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,201
Like the novel.
You know it?

259
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:45,336
Should I?

260
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:46,637
Mm-hmm.

261
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:02,453
Before your time, but it was a very
popular book in the late '70s.

262
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,188
Wait. This is
a Thomas Blackburn novel.

263
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,590
Yes. That's the way he
used to sign his letters,

264
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,293
<i>the title of his novel,
Friends in Colorado.</i>

265
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:13,230
Thomas Blackburn.
I--I know his work.

266
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:14,632
Thomas Blackburn...

267
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:17,201
an infamous, crazed novelist

268
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,669
risen from homeless,
bipolar,

269
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,505
counter-culture activist
to literary icon.

270
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:26,377
His books were written
in a haze of pills, booze,

271
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,913
and, to some,
schizophrenic genius.

272
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,782
He was a beast
from a less civilized era.

273
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,018
Thomas!

274
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,320
Hey, Thomas!

275
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,621
You're ruining
my concentration!

276
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,557
He'd been arrested
many times.

277
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,759
During an interview in 1974,

278
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:44,295
he tied the reporter to a chair
and threw him into the pool.

279
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:45,563
He isn't coming up!

280
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,699
He'd been arrested again

281
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,802
at the late Senator Raider's
reelection party in 1996.

282
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:53,204
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm press.

283
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,438
Press right here.

284
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,607
Hey, listen,
ladies and gentlemen?

285
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,943
Uh, you're
campaign contributors.

286
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,578
I just want you to know
that the acid in your drink

287
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,847
is gonna kick in
in about 18 minutes.

288
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:34,912
Thomas Blackburn?

289
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,447
Who's asking?

290
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,482
Hi. I'm a journalist
from risingjournal.com.

291
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,817
I just wanted to know
if I could ask you

292
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,652
a few questions
about James Hirsch.

293
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,454
Have you read
my latest book?

294
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:44,822
Which one?

295
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:47,124
The one called
"Go Fuck Yourself"?

296
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:59,036
So Blackburn isn't talking
to journalists anymore.

297
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:01,639
That's fantastic.

298
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:09,146
So let's see what
this little guy has to offer.

299
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,988
Patient 11?

300
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,000
Time is 5:13 P.M.,

301
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:08,272
administering 200 milligrams of pure
Dimethyltryptamine extracted from...

302
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,675
Nobody said anything
about restraints.

303
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:40,838
What is this?

304
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,574
Hello, Dr. Kessel?

305
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:46,744
Just relax, please.

306
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,546
Everything
will be fine.

307
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,618
Whose voice is that?

308
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,622
They can see me.

309
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:01,659
They--They can see me.

310
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:13,304
In the room now.

311
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:16,006
I can hear them.

312
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:17,575
I can hear them.

313
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,779
It's all gone away.

314
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,716
It's all gone away.

315
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,054
You hear them?

316
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,325
It's all gone away.

317
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,366
N1.

318
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,836
N2.

319
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,007
H2.

320
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:54,144
O7.

321
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:58,282
C11.

322
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
They're here.
They're here.
Aah!

323
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,407
Patient 11,
can you hear me?

324
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Patient 11, I need you
to respond to me!

325
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:08,352
Extracting 325 milligrams of
Dimethyltryptamine from a primary source.

326
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,325
Do you know
what's on that tape?

327
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:18,862
That's not regular Dimethyltryptamine
that the CIA injected people with.

328
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,364
Then what was it?

329
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:23,834
They were extracting a chemical from
a special source, the human brain.

330
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:25,502
Medical corpses,
the pineal gland.

331
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:25,957
Come on.

332
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:27,771
The chemicals foundnaturally
in the brain?

333
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:31,275
Yes. They're extracting it from dead
bodies, injecting it into live ones.

334
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:32,309
Lovely.

335
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,877
Anything else
good on that tape?

336
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,646
I don't know.

337
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:37,648
The last 35 minutes
have been erased.

338
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,083
I sent it over
to the guys at video forensics

339
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:41,919
to see if they can pull
anything out of it.

340
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:44,054
We get it back
next week.

341
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,355
Oh.

342
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:46,457
In the meantime,

343
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,759
I still got to find a way
to get to Blackburn.

344
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:50,327
You just know
he's connected to it.

345
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,795
He's a writer.

346
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,831
He doesn't have the skills to
synthesize something like that.

347
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,199
It's a CIA chemical,
I know,

348
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,668
but maybe Blackburn
got his hands on it somehow.

349
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,036
I mean,
think about it.

350
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,040
Both men in western Nevada,
the letter signature.

351
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,875
Blackburn found
the chemical

352
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:06,276
and gave it to James
for his research.

353
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:07,311
It's possible.

354
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,379
It's probable,

355
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,882
and I know what to do
to get to Blackburn.

356
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:14,184
Great.
What are you gonna do?

357
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,005
Honey, I'm home.

358
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,776
How.

359
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,013
One bourbon, please.

360
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:45,749
Hey, Thomas.
What's up?

361
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:47,050
I got arrested
this morning.

362
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,585
Same as yesterday, huh?

363
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:51,722
Yeah, same as yesterday.

364
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,957
I was peeing
in my own front yard

365
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,726
in the same spot
I been peeing in

366
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:56,894
for the past 15 years,

367
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,362
and there
just happened to be

368
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,297
a sheriff's deputy's car
parked there.

369
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,965
Fuckin' Nazi cop.

370
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,634
Don't you think
it's a man's right

371
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:04,735
to pee
in the fucking desert?

372
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:07,638
Thomas?
Thomas Blackburn?

373
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,573
Yes?

374
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:11,441
I'm the writer
who emailed you.

375
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,577
Sarah? Sarah Weiss?

376
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,480
Right!
Right?

377
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:17,881
Right, yes.

378
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:20,751
The "print is dead,
down on her luck" story.

379
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:22,186
Wow.

380
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:25,289
It's nice to finally
put a face to the name.

381
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:28,325
Well, it's nice to finally--
Sarah.

382
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,828
Oh, no thanks.
I've got a drink.

383
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,362
That's not for you.

384
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,835
I feel sorry
for you kids, you know that?

385
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,269
With your fucking computers
and shit.

386
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,804
You know what?
You can tell a writer

387
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,372
who actually puts
a pen to paper,

388
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:46,844
who actually scribbles
on a fucking napkin.

389
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:48,545
You haven't written a new
novel in, like, eight years.

390
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,047
I'm an old fucking man.

391
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,381
I would love to read
something you've written.

392
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:52,950
No, you wouldn't.
No, you wouldn't.

393
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,017
You know
what I like to write?

394
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,619
You know
what I like to write?

395
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,156
Pornography.
Oh, is that right?

396
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:00,691
I'm quite good
at it, yes.

397
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,793
"50 Shades of Shit."

398
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:04,828
Your fans worship you.

399
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,896
They don't worship me.

400
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:07,264
They worship
an image of myself,

401
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:10,334
an image I've created,
carefully constructed.

402
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,568
I'm a myth.

403
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,338
Come on, being loved
by so many adoring fans

404
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,607
isn't a good enough
motivation for you?

405
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:19,810
Let me tell you
something

406
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,311
one of my ex-wives
once told me.

407
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:24,314
She said, "Everyone
will love you, Thomas,

408
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,149
except those of us
who know you best."

409
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,151
But tell me,
young writer,

410
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:29,553
what is it
you are writing about?

411
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:32,589
Um, actually,
you'd probably love it.

412
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,992
It's a novel about the
narco war in Mexico

413
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:38,829
and two young lovers who experiment
with different chemicals and...

414
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:40,097
It sounds fuckin' trite.

415
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,331
Well, it's
a work in progress.

416
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,833
Yeah, make 'em--
make 'em lesbians.

417
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:45,002
Really?
Burmese throat-singing lesbians.

418
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:47,304
I don't know much
about that subject.

419
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:48,705
Maybe
you could help me.

420
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,941
Well, speaking of ingesting
experimental chemicals,

421
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,110
what are you doing
this weekend?

422
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:55,646
Um, I didn't plan
that far ahead.

423
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,647
Well, tell you what.

424
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:58,048
Why don't you join myself

425
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,083
and some fellow travelers
at my place.

426
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,551
We're planning
an experiment.

427
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:05,956
It'll be an experience
you will not forget.

428
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,406
Oh, I didn't know
you were into...

429
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,208
What is it, art?

430
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,411
Yes, that's art,
young lady.

431
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:30,314
It's not a toy.
Don't touch that.

432
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:33,517
So who did your interior
decorating, Charles Manson?

433
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,253
Oh, why,
fuck you very much.

434
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:38,622
You have
a lot of weapons around.

435
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,757
Didn't you shoot
your assistant last year?

436
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,026
Yes, and I feel terrible
about that.

437
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:44,428
But in my defense,
she was an idiot

438
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,463
for walking
into my line of fire.

439
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,700
Now people go around saying
I wanted to kill the bitch.

440
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,704
How do you not go
to jail for that?

441
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:56,506
You still have
your permit?

442
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:57,941
When you're innocent,

443
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,643
you can get away
with anything.

444
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:07,718
Sarah?

445
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,419
Party's in the kitchen.

446
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,135
Sarah? Callie.

447
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:27,771
Callie? Sarah.
Callie is wicked smart.

448
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:30,073
She's got a PhD
in organic chemistry,

449
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:32,776
but she's
sort of an alchemist.

450
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,778
Yeah, she's a bit granola
and crystal for me.

451
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:38,415
She reeks of patchouli oil,
but I love her anyway.

452
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,083
So this is it?

453
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,386
How do you ever get
the formula for this?

454
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:45,222
It's my own
little secret recipe.

455
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:48,392
This is government
stuff, isn't it?

456
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,896
Aren't you worried about
the dangers of taking it?

457
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:55,399
This isn't the CIA,
Sarah.

458
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:58,435
We're not strapping
people down in a dark room

459
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:01,338
and scaring the fuck
out of them

460
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:06,076
just to see how far
we can stretch their sanity.

461
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:11,882
This is about...freedom,
mind expansion.

462
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,050
Power to the people.

463
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:14,184
Freedom, motherfuckers.

464
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:16,686
Positive energy.
That's right.

465
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:17,721
Positive energy,
huh?

466
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:18,989
Mm-hmm.
I can do that.

467
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:20,757
Yeah? You positive?

468
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:24,127
So don't start on me with that...
Yeah, I am positive.

469
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:26,897
fear shit, Sarah,
if you're really positive.

470
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,032
Well, it's
my first time.

471
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,600
It's normal, right?

472
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,602
What's normal?

473
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,573
Here we go, Sarah.

474
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,141
Ready for takeoff?

475
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:49,019
A little for you,
a little for me.

476
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:52,355
A little for you,
a little for me.

477
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:54,758
A little more for you.

478
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,601
Ahh!

479
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,336
Foul fucking venom!

480
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:16,446
Wow.

481
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,348
How long
before it kicks in?

482
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,418
Oh, a few minutes.
30 at the very most.

483
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,886
Not as fast
as injecting it,

484
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:24,921
but not
as junkie, either.

485
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:28,325
Here we go...chaser.

486
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:39,836
Ms. Weiss, I wanted
to ask you something.

487
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,239
Sure. What is it?

488
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,710
How do you feel
about liars?

489
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,714
Uh, What? Liars?

490
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:54,584
Liars, swine, swindlers.

491
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,586
I don't know.
What do you mean?

492
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,890
Well, I, for one,
cannot stand the bastards

493
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:01,391
who are bad at it.
That's it.

494
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:04,127
They lack
a certain panache.

495
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:06,263
Well, who does?

496
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:09,166
Now, I'm not opposed
to a good...

497
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:12,269
a good swindle
every now and then,

498
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:13,770
but a bad one,
a bad liar,

499
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:17,307
that's something that
I simply can't abide.

500
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:20,944
Yeah, I--I agree
with you.

501
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:22,379
What is it?

502
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:25,015
Your name's
not Sarah Weiss, is it?

503
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,683
Excuse me?

504
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,453
Now I can understand your
reticence with taking the drug.

505
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:34,057
I mean, why would a fine,
upstanding investigative journalist

506
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,892
like Anne Roland
want to sully

507
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:38,862
an already fragile reputation
with bad business like that?

508
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,298
No, it's not like that.
You have to...

509
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,700
It's okay, it's okay.

510
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,602
I've, uh...

511
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:48,238
I've told a few lies
in my time, too.

512
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,575
Yes. Recently, in fact.

513
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,546
For instance, I told you that the
drug was in that blue liquid,

514
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:00,217
which you so discreetly
threw in my wastepaper bin.

515
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,819
It's not?

516
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:05,322
No. No.

517
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,995
It was in the whiskey
you just drank.

518
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,168
You motherfucker!

519
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,803
No sympathy
for the devil.

520
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,504
Keep that in mind.

521
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,509
Buy the ticket,
take the ride!

522
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,081
And it's gonna be
a good one.

523
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:35,485
Olivia, call me back
as soon as you get this.

524
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,454
Blackburn tricked me
into drinking that chemical.

525
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:40,190
He knew exactly
who I was this whole time.

526
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:41,625
Call me.

527
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:43,793
This is Anne, by the way.

528
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:53,670
I...

529
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:55,705
I can't be alone
with Blackburn.

530
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:58,375
I feel uncomfortable.

531
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:01,378
I--I feel unsettled.

532
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:04,948
Unsettled?
What, like physically?

533
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,618
Something is coming.

534
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:14,057
What do you mean,
something's coming?

535
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,059
Are you okay?

536
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,761
No, I'm not.

537
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,200
What's going on?
Wh-what--

538
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,502
Something's
watching you?

539
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:27,470
I don't like this.
It can see me.

540
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,140
Who can see you?

541
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,741
I don't know.

542
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:42,385
Did you hear that?

543
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:30,667
Callie?

544
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,905
Callie?

545
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,073
What's happened?

546
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,274
Are you okay?

547
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:41,444
It looked at me
from the window.

548
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:43,546
What did?

549
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,848
Talk to me!

550
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,417
I turned around,
and it was looking at me.

551
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:48,852
I saw it.

552
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,112
It's coming
to the house now.

553
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,959
What is?

554
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:35,298
It's downstairs now
by the back door.

555
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,866
What is?

556
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,603
You know.

557
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Aah!

558
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,186
Aah!

559
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,658
What is going on?

560
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,926
There's something
in your house, Thomas!

561
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:11,394
There's something
in your house!

562
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:12,462
Why, you're
just hallucinating!

563
00:42:12,464 --> 00:42:13,596
Calm down!

564
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:14,797
No, no.
Callie saw it! I saw it!

565
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:15,999
There's something
in your house!

566
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:17,534
What? What? What?
Saw what?

567
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:19,536
It wants to wear us.

568
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:22,038
It wants to wear us.

569
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,873
It wants to wear us!

570
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,976
Don't say that.
Don't say that.

571
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:34,417
All right. You fuckers
stand over there.

572
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:35,919
Go on.
Sit in the corner.

573
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,756
Sanity,
for fuck's sake.

574
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:51,668
I hear something.

575
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,303
What the fuck?

576
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,083
Holy...

577
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,053
shit!

578
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:14,691
What the fuck was that?
It was a hallucination.

579
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:17,093
No, but--
We took a drug.

580
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,127
No. No, no, no.

581
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:19,495
Oh, fine!

582
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:22,332
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Stop it!

583
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:23,333
What's happening?

584
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:24,334
Shut up.

585
00:43:24,336 --> 00:43:25,768
Oh, fuck.

586
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Do you have
any idea who I am?
I'll blow your fucking...

587
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Where's my gun?

588
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:26,029
Thomas? Wake up.

589
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:28,064
Thomas?

590
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:31,167
Wake up.
Wake the fuck up.

591
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:36,172
Where--Where's Callie?

592
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,774
Where did she go?

593
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,208
Don't know.

594
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,046
Where--Where the fuck
did she go?

595
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:44,447
What happened?

596
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:45,515
Was it the drug?

597
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:46,749
Did--Did
it really happen?

598
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:48,818
Where is she?

599
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,387
I don't know.
It seemed fucking real.

600
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:58,594
How long were we out?

601
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:00,797
I don't know.
A couple of hours?

602
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,899
I think the drug has
worn off at this point.

603
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:04,901
Oh, before I forget.

604
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:08,171
Jesus!
What the fuck?

605
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,374
How could you--
I'll fucking kill you!

606
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,643
You are just shit, Thomas!
Back off!

607
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,414
Let's get
the fuck out of here.

608
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:19,582
Fuck.

609
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,757
Look, I need to know
what happened back there.

610
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:29,892
You and me both, sister.

611
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,994
That's what
these government boys do

612
00:45:31,996 --> 00:45:33,663
is they take
something beautiful,

613
00:45:33,665 --> 00:45:36,165
something transcendent
and powerful,

614
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,801
like pure Dimethyltryptamine,
and fuck it up!

615
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:41,304
Turn it into something dark,
something ugly.

616
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:43,539
What, you think
it's a mind control thing?

617
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,974
Well, if it's real,

618
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:46,509
what happened
to Callie's body?

619
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:47,710
Did you see her body?

620
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:48,811
No. No, I didn't.

621
00:45:48,813 --> 00:45:50,246
Me, neither.

622
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,647
Makes you wonder.

623
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:53,516
Yeah. It makes me wonder
what else it did.

624
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:07,997
We're now going
to administer

625
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:10,099
200 milligrams
of the new compound,

626
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:12,435
Number 19 enhanced
Dimethyltryptamine,

627
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:16,739
a combined substance containing
extract from the primary source.

628
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,775
Just relax.

629
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:20,943
There we are.

630
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,814
Just relax, dear.

631
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:54,644
All right,
don't be afraid.

632
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,245
Don't be afraid.

633
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

634
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:35,885
Patient 14?

635
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:40,556
Patient 14,
can you hear me?

636
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,126
Patient 14,
can you hear me?

637
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:05,181
What's happening?
She's gone.

638
00:48:05,183 --> 00:48:07,483
Where are
all the lights?

639
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,456
Let's check in there.

640
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

641
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,713
What is happening
to her?

642
00:49:10,715 --> 00:49:11,781
No! No! No!

643
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:12,982
Aah! No!

644
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:15,017
No! No!

645
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:18,955
It came.
It came through.

646
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:21,290
What'd you say?

647
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,181
Did you know
James Hirsch?

648
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:47,783
Uh...aspiring writer kid

649
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:49,819
who wrote me some letters
a couple years ago.

650
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:53,255
Wanted to know about the
chemicals used in MK-ULTRA.

651
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:54,924
So you sent him
the new chemical?

652
00:49:54,926 --> 00:49:57,626
Callie made a batch.
Each batch is different.

653
00:49:57,628 --> 00:50:01,130
But, yeah. Uh, he asked
nicely, using his real name,

654
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:03,165
so we acquired him some.

655
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,701
Well, James is missing,
probably dead.

656
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:08,270
Did you know that?

657
00:50:08,272 --> 00:50:10,473
I did not.
I'm sorry to hear that.

658
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:12,641
You don't even know
what he looks like, do you?

659
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:13,743
No, I never met him.

660
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,352
So that's it then, huh?

661
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,987
That's what this
is all about.

662
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:27,390
I want to know
what happened to James--

663
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:28,858
why he went missing,
who's behind this,

664
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:32,928
and what this MK-ULTRA drug
is really doing to people.

665
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,497
You have any idea
what dirty business

666
00:50:34,499 --> 00:50:35,931
the U.S. Government
has perpetrated

667
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:37,633
on its citizens
over the last 200 years?

668
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:40,636
And you want to know about one CIA
chemical brainwashing project.

669
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:42,571
Well, you didn't know
James, did you?

670
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:43,639
No.

671
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,408
Considering you ingested
the chemical, too,

672
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,076
I'm surprised
you're not more concerned.

673
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:47,890
I mean, who knows?

674
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:50,146
This shit could probably
kill you, too, Thomas.

675
00:50:50,148 --> 00:50:52,081
Oh, people are afraid
of death

676
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,983
just because death
is so fucking ordinary.

677
00:50:53,985 --> 00:50:55,985
It happens all the time.

678
00:50:55,987 --> 00:50:57,653
No, not like this.

679
00:50:57,655 --> 00:50:59,355
What about Callie?

680
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:02,658
How did she get her hands
on this--this chemical formula?

681
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,061
We didn't talk much.
She didn't talk much.

682
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:06,429
You don't ask
questions like that.

683
00:51:06,431 --> 00:51:07,797
It's bad etiquette,
you know.

684
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:09,165
It makes them
squirrelly.

685
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:10,266
Would you know
where she lives?

686
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:11,434
Maybe we can go there
and check.

687
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:12,968
Yeah, sure.
She lives in, uh,

688
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,771
one of these McMansions
she bought outside of Reno.

689
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:16,972
It was in an empty suburb.

690
00:51:16,974 --> 00:51:18,274
She got it
when the market tanked.

691
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:22,411
We used to go there
and smoke marijuana.

692
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

693
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,120
Aah!

694
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:32,455
Oh, my God!

695
00:51:45,236 --> 00:51:46,735
Are you okay?

696
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,439
Thomas!
Are you okay?

697
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,175
Talk to me!
Oh, fuck.

698
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:56,912
Oh, my head!
God damn it!

699
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:58,280
Shit.

700
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,348
Shit.

701
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,364
What happened to you?

702
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:18,501
I don't know.
I blacked out.

703
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:22,138
I heard chattering
and then blackness.

704
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,112
Ow, shit!

705
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:31,380
Thomas?

706
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:33,215
Ohh!

707
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:34,583
Are you okay?

708
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:40,422
The chemical
is like a catalyst.

709
00:52:40,424 --> 00:52:43,926
It--It turns your mind
into a receiver.

710
00:52:43,928 --> 00:52:45,694
It lets them in.

711
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:47,296
How do you know that?

712
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:51,834
I don't.
It's just a feeling.

713
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,307
Well, I want to find out
who's behind this.

714
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:01,844
Well, you're in luck, because I
think it wants to find us, too.

715
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:02,945
You stay there.

716
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:03,946
Take this with you.

717
00:53:03,948 --> 00:53:05,548
Keep it on channel two.

718
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:06,882
Stay sharp.

719
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:10,753
Radio check.

720
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:13,422
Check.

721
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:14,924
The button's
on the side.

722
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,126
Check.

723
00:53:17,128 --> 00:53:18,494
Check.

724
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,036
Have you
ever read any H.P. Lovecraft?

725
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:28,504
No.

726
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:31,740
Wrote a story in about
1930-something or other

727
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:35,010
was about a scientist who
created an electronic device,

728
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:37,112
a giant tuning fork.

729
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:40,349
It emitted
a resonance wave that, um...

730
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:42,818
It stimulated anybody
who was nearby,

731
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,589
their pineal gland,
allowing them to experience

732
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:51,493
planes of existence outside the
scope of accepted reality.

733
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:53,295
He would see incredible,

734
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:56,899
sometimes horrible things,
these entities.

735
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,769
He kept turning it up
higher and higher,

736
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:04,173
'cause he was really getting
off on seeing this shit,

737
00:54:04,175 --> 00:54:07,109
but it was too late
when he realized

738
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:09,945
that the entities,

739
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:12,348
they could see him, too.

740
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,884
You know, that's a really fucked-up
story to be telling me now.

741
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,331
Thomas, it...

742
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:32,635
It looks like someone's
been here.

743
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,049
Are you sure
she lived here,

744
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:48,784
like, ate and slept?

745
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,486
She definitely was here.

746
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:52,921
How much sleeping she did,
I couldn't tell you.

747
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,625
There's
a surveillance camera.

748
00:54:58,162 --> 00:54:59,595
Thomas, can you hear me?

749
00:54:59,597 --> 00:55:00,996
I'm getting static.

750
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,302
What am I looking for?

751
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:08,103
Should be a basement door

752
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:09,204
around the kitchen
someplace,

753
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:10,973
because anything
she's making

754
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,408
is going to be
below ground.

755
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:13,909
Keeps the feds
and local law enforcement

756
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:16,945
from using thermal imaging
to discover anything.

757
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,999
I got it.

758
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:35,824
Callie keeps parts
of the human brain down here.

759
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:37,960
What does that mean?

760
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:41,997
It means she took at least part of
the chemical from the human brain.

761
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:44,767
Well, whatever
floats your boat, right?

762
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:47,836
Can we go?
It's cold out here.

763
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:59,014
She found Chamber 5.

764
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:01,316
It's in
the Black Rock Desert.

765
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:02,351
What?

766
00:57:02,353 --> 00:57:04,052
Callie.
She found Chamber 5.

767
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:06,522
It's where they did the
original CIA experiments.

768
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:09,057
Dr. Kessel, MK-ULTRA?

769
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:10,726
Can we go already?

770
00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:14,062
It's 2:45 in the morning,
and my eyes are bleeding.

771
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:28,010
The time is 5:13 P.M.,

772
00:57:28,012 --> 00:57:32,281
administering 200 milligrams
of pure Dimethyltryptamine

773
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:34,950
extracted
from the primary source.

774
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:42,191
N1.

775
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:44,626
N2.

776
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:49,998
H2.

777
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,901
O7.

778
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:58,407
"N1-N2-H2...
- C11.

779
00:57:58,409 --> 00:58:01,143
O7-C11"?

780
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:06,248
Nitrogen, hydrogen...

781
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:10,719
oxygen, carbon.

782
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:15,757
Oh, my God.

783
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:20,929
Uh, the CIA didn't come up
with the formula.

784
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:22,865
They did.

785
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:25,834
Oh, my God.
You were right.

786
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:28,604
The chemical doesn't
make you hallucinate.

787
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:31,373
It turns your brain
into a receiver

788
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:33,141
so they could come through.

789
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,712
Shit.

790
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:48,617
Thomas, I'm looking at
the video surveillance footage.

791
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:04,766
It looks like Callie.

792
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,070
It looks like...

793
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:12,107
Callie walked
down to the basement.

794
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:16,011
Thomas, are you there?

795
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:18,880
I can see it
on the footage.

796
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:20,782
It's by the stairs.

797
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:39,234
Eight minutes ago.

798
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:06,962
Callie?

799
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:14,903
Callie?

800
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,110
Callie, is that you?

801
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,817
Callie?

802
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Aah! Aah!

803
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:13,729
Aah!

804
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:17,299
Aah!

805
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:19,234
Help me!

806
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Shit! Shit! Fuck!
Ohh!
Aah!

807
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,918
Well, Jesus, Anne!
You scared me!

808
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:51,399
There's
only one option.

809
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:53,068
What is that,
dear Anne?

810
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,971
Into the desert,
Chamber 5.

811
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,875
No shit.

812
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:11,586
This is the heart of it.

813
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:13,155
Everything circles
around here.

814
01:03:13,157 --> 01:03:15,257
I've seen things
in every single place

815
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:16,892
before either of us
took the chemical.

816
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:20,796
James's cabin, Callie's
house, the desert.

817
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:24,866
This is where we need to go if
we want to stop the signal.

818
01:03:24,868 --> 01:03:28,036
This chemical is creating
more receivers,

819
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:31,106
more hosts to wear,
more ways to spread.

820
01:03:31,108 --> 01:03:33,141
We've been
fucked with enough

821
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:36,011
by this horrible hydra
of a research project.

822
01:03:36,013 --> 01:03:37,913
You don't scare
too easily, do you, Anne?

823
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:40,348
This shit terrifies
the fuck out of me.

824
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,450
Well, I'm more scared
of what it will do to me

825
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:44,252
if I try to run

826
01:03:44,254 --> 01:03:48,056
and they all
catch up with us.

827
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:49,958
What if
it doesn't follow us?

828
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,928
Do you want to bet
your life on that?

829
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,202
Anne, I never
gave you the drug.

830
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:03,972
What?

831
01:04:03,974 --> 01:04:06,041
I was fucking with you.

832
01:04:06,043 --> 01:04:08,009
You lied to me
to get your story,

833
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:11,880
so I returned the favor
and I lied to you.

834
01:04:11,882 --> 01:04:14,382
There wasn't anything
in that whiskey,

835
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:16,451
no--no DMT 19.

836
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:18,253
You're lying.
No, I'm not lying.

837
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:20,121
You can walk away clean,
Anne.

838
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:21,423
What will I do when it
catches up with me then?

839
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:22,490
Then what?

840
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:25,026
The point is,
you don't have to do this.

841
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,628
No, you're wrong.

842
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,231
James's friend, Renny,
didn't take the drug.

843
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:30,632
It was
only a matter of days.

844
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:34,402
Anne...

845
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,441
take your chances.

846
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:41,610
Isn't that
what I'm doing?

847
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Ow!

848
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:09,371
What?

849
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:10,639
Shocked me.

850
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,475
Static electricity?

851
01:05:13,477 --> 01:05:14,976
No, no, no, her brain,

852
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:17,078
it's still giving off
an electromagnet charge.

853
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,780
No, no. It's a corpse.

854
01:05:18,782 --> 01:05:21,216
I know it's a corpse, Doctor.
It still shocked me.

855
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:39,167
You seeing this?

856
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:42,037
There's still activity
in the brain?

857
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:46,741
This is something stronger
than normal brain activity.

858
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
State of high alertness, beta
waves range max at 40 hertz.
This is going up to 135.
That's strong...

859
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,702
I think we can
walk from here.

860
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,639
You okay?

861
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:23,378
Thomas,
you're bleeding again.

862
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:26,681
I'm fine.

863
01:06:26,683 --> 01:06:28,817
You know,
we don't have to do this.

864
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:30,318
I can take you
to a hospital.

865
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,188
Hey, you said yourself
it'll be waiting for us.

866
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:35,557
Let's not disappoint.

867
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:42,497
Every now and then,
you run up into a night

868
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:46,201
that's a stone-ass bummer
from start to finish.

869
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:48,136
On nights like those,

870
01:06:48,138 --> 01:06:49,437
if you know
what's good for you,

871
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:53,675
you hunker down
and you hide.

872
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,048
This is not
one of those nights.

873
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,592
Tell you what.

874
01:07:10,594 --> 01:07:12,427
We take this gas can,

875
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:15,563
and we torch
whatever we find inside.

876
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,267
Lead on, Anne.

877
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:46,261
This must be where
they're broadcasting from.

878
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,001
There she blows!

879
01:07:53,003 --> 01:07:55,336
Hump
like a snow hill.

880
01:07:55,338 --> 01:07:57,472
This is
an old fallout shelter.

881
01:07:57,474 --> 01:07:59,908
Well, you gotta give
those government boys credit

882
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,676
for efficient
repurposing.

883
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:29,104
After you.

884
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,826
Well, this is it.

885
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:53,695
It's Chamber 5.

886
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:20,388
They just left it
like this.

887
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:37,338
Thomas,
put the drugs down.

888
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:51,719
You know what
that's for, don't you?

889
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:52,820
No.

890
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:55,423
Medical doctors used
to tie people down to that

891
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:59,327
and fill them
full of exotic drugs.

892
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:01,429
Now, that's entertainment.

893
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:04,966
How do you know that?

894
01:10:58,153 --> 01:10:59,420
What is that?

895
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,356
Fuck if I know.

896
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
I can't see anything.

897
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:33,755
Aah! Oh!

898
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:34,756
Oh, my God!

899
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,359
What is it?

900
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:40,962
Thomas, there's
something alive in here!

901
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:49,771
This is the transmitter.

902
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:52,073
This is the source.
We...

903
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:53,074
We need to burn
this thing.

904
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:54,609
Where did
we put the gas?

905
01:11:54,611 --> 01:11:56,544
They wanted us
to come here!

906
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Thomas,
where the fuck--

907
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,420
There's something...

908
01:12:05,422 --> 01:12:06,954
There's something
coming down the hall!

909
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:08,623
Thomas, there's something
coming down the hall!

910
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:11,526
Close the fucking door!

911
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,129
They're coming for us.
They're coming for us.

912
01:12:15,131 --> 01:12:16,964
My God, they're
coming for us.

913
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:18,566
That's it. We're dead.

914
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:24,038
Ohh!

915
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,609
Oh, fuck.

916
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,683
Here, you fucks.

917
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,985
No, no, no, no!
Sorry, Anne.

918
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:39,987
Aah!

919
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:03,745
Thomas!

920
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:06,481
Damn you!

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

923
01:14:03,506 --> 01:14:07,008
Please...come...back.

924
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:10,978
Please...come...back.

925
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:14,816
Please...come...back.

926
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Aah!

927
01:14:38,174 --> 01:14:42,243
Please...come...back.

928
01:14:42,245 --> 01:14:45,680
Please...come...back.

929
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:50,551
Please...come...back.

930
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:54,489
Please...come...back.

931
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:58,025
Please...come...back.

932
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:04,131
Please...come...back.

933
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:06,167
Come...back.

934
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:08,402
Come...back.

935
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:11,372
Aah!

936
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:13,474
No!

937
01:15:13,476 --> 01:15:15,076
Aah!

938
01:15:18,248 --> 01:15:20,114
No!

939
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:18,973
No.

940
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:24,145
No. No.

941
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,249
James? No.

942
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,753
No.

943
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:49,590
Thank God!

944
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:52,193
I never thought I'd be
so happy to see you.

945
01:18:52,195 --> 01:18:54,061
Just so damn glad
you're safe.

946
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:55,796
You scared the shit
out of me.

947
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,899
How you feeling?

948
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:00,935
Um, I'm surviving.

949
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:10,044
Do you think they'll
charge me with anything?

950
01:19:10,046 --> 01:19:12,213
Rising Journal will
take care of any legal fees.

951
01:19:12,215 --> 01:19:14,482
I think they'll
just want to keep you

952
01:19:14,484 --> 01:19:15,716
a little while
for questions

953
01:19:15,718 --> 01:19:17,785
while they try
to sort things out.

954
01:19:17,787 --> 01:19:20,254
There's gonna be
years of questions.

955
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:27,595
Video forensics company
sent back your U-matic tape.

956
01:19:27,597 --> 01:19:30,898
They were able to pull
additional footage from the end.

957
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,267
Well, what else
is on that tape?

958
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:34,769
Let's...

959
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:37,004
Let's not worry
about that now.

960
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:42,076
The things I saw,
I can't...

961
01:19:42,078 --> 01:19:46,814
I found James's remains,
Olivia, in Chamber 5.

962
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:49,784
I--I--It was like he was
watching me this whole time.

963
01:19:49,786 --> 01:19:51,685
It was wearing him.

964
01:19:51,687 --> 01:19:53,287
Who?

965
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,623
It wasn't the drug
that killed him.

966
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:58,826
It is a chemical catalyst
that turns the brain

967
01:19:58,828 --> 01:20:01,061
into some sort of receiver
and--and...

968
01:20:01,063 --> 01:20:03,097
so they could come through.

969
01:20:03,099 --> 01:20:07,101
Okay. I'm not saying this,

970
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:09,036
but you know
what they'll say.

971
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:11,906
They know the truth.

972
01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:14,241
I--I really wish
I didn't.

973
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:18,546
Can I ask you something?

974
01:20:18,548 --> 01:20:20,514
Sure.

975
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:25,085
You're 100% certain that Blackburn
didn't put anything in your drink?

976
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:27,888
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

977
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,990
But how do you know
for sure?

978
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:31,458
He wouldn't.

979
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,927
He has no reason to.

980
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:34,895
Well, I hope you're right.

981
01:20:36,898 --> 01:20:40,901
'Cause you just never know what's
really going on in someone's head.

982
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,138
Yeah, you're right.

983
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,877
You never found
Renny Seegan, did you?

984
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,247
No.

985
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:55,850
And he never took
the drug, right?

986
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:02,323
No. I...
You're gonna be okay.

987
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:09,630
No.

988
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:11,699
No, no, no.

989
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:13,033
What is that sound?

990
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:16,136
No, no, no. No, no.

991
01:21:16,138 --> 01:21:17,304
Help!

992
01:21:17,306 --> 01:21:19,740
No! No!

993
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Somebody help!
Please help us!
No!
Aah!

994
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:29,416
Aah!

995
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:31,018
Again.

996
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,353
Aah!

997
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:34,421
It turns your mind
into a receiver.

998
01:21:34,423 --> 01:21:36,123
It lets them in.

999
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:39,660
Approaching
475 volts.

1000
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:42,630
His neurological response
is already so disrupted,

1001
01:21:42,632 --> 01:21:44,899
he's not going to be able
to recall any of this.

1002
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:46,567
He's going to exhibit

1003
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:49,103
some very unusual mental side
effects for the rest of his life.

1004
01:21:49,105 --> 01:21:51,405
Fine. Make certain.

1005
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,376
And again.

1006
01:21:57,512 --> 01:21:59,480
Aah!

1007
01:21:59,482 --> 01:22:02,349
You never know what's
really going on in someone's head.

1008
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:04,418
What kind of friend
gives you poison?

1009
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:08,088
When you're done,
take him out of here.

1010
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:09,657
Just dump him?

1011
01:22:09,659 --> 01:22:12,259
He's injected with DMT 19.

1012
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:14,428
We have no idea
what effect on the brain...

1013
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:17,564
Clean-up and rehabilitation
are not our purview.

1014
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:19,366
We are done with him.

1015
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:21,802
You want me to just
hand him off to a field team?

1016
01:22:21,804 --> 01:22:24,204
Yes.

1017
01:22:24,206 --> 01:22:28,375
He lived near the campus,
grad student volunteer.

1018
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:31,745
You can get his address
from our personal file.

1019
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:33,447
What's the name?

1020
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,115
Uh...Blackburn.

1021
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,051
Thomas Blackburn.

1022
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:41,989
Hit him again.

1023
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:48,662
Aah!

1024
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,631
But the follow-up study
showed that 60% of those

1025
01:23:57,633 --> 01:23:59,833
who had been de-patterned
still have amnesia

1026
01:23:59,835 --> 01:24:02,603
for periods of anywhere
from 6 months to 10 years.

1027
01:24:02,605 --> 01:24:05,072
That's quite
a memory loss, isn't it?

1028
01:24:05,074 --> 01:24:06,840
That is a memory loss.
Indeed it is.

1029
01:24:06,842 --> 01:24:08,375
It's, uh, more...

1030
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:10,344
I think
more than desirable.
