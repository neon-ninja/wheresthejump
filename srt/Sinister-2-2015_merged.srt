00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

3
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,431
Hey.

4
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,331
This is the part where you say,

5
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,765
"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."

6
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:47,366
Yes.

7
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,898
How long since your last confession?

8
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,899
I've, actually, uh...

9
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,398
I've never had a confession before.

10
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,930
You've never had the
Sacrament of Reconciliation?

11
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:04,597
No, I've never had any sacraments

12
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,698
that I can think of,
not that I can remember.

13
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:09,066
I mean, I may have had one by accident.

14
00:04:09,097 --> 00:04:11,065
To tell you the truth, I
actually never even been

15
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:13,030
inside of one of these, or
like a church or anything,

16
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:15,598
but there was a funeral... I'm sorry.

17
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:21,498
I didn't know who else to talk to.

18
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:23,632
You're the deputy from that Oswalt thing.

19
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:27,098
Well... I'm not on the force anymore.

20
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:29,931
But you are him, right?

21
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:31,464
Yeah.

22
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:37,098
So...

23
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:39,398
if I... if I tell you something,

24
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,631
it stays between us, right, like lawyers?

25
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:44,597
Yeah, but I'm gonna ask
you not to tell me anything

26
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:47,831
that I can't unhear,
if you know what I mean.

27
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:50,332
Okay.

28
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:52,865
Do you believe in evil?

29
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:55,066
I mean, of course you do, you know.

30
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:58,631
You mean, do I believe in the supernatural?

31
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,031
Ghosts and demons, and the devil himself.

32
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:05,564
Something like that, yeah.

33
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:08,532
This is about your friend, your case.

34
00:05:10,465 --> 00:05:11,865
What did you find?

35
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:14,597
I don't know, I can't explain it.

36
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,331
It's something, uh...

37
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:20,598
otherworldly.

38
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:23,066
And you want to know how to stop it.

39
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:25,497
Yes.

40
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,564
What do you want me to say?

41
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:29,798
You should carry a cross and holy water,

42
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,532
and shout, "The power
of Christ compels you?"

43
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:35,365
Why, would that work?

44
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:37,364
No.

45
00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:38,966
Right.

46
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:42,597
- You want my professional advice?
- Yes.

47
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,731
You don't stop evil.

48
00:05:44,764 --> 00:05:47,664
You can only protect yourself from it.

49
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:49,665
Do I believe things that
you're talking about exist?

50
00:05:49,698 --> 00:05:51,332
Yes.

51
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:54,998
And I believe they exist to
lure men like you into them.

52
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:58,065
Stay out of it, whatever it is.

53
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:04,432
Whatever happened to the Oswalts

54
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,898
is only gonna happen again.

55
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,030
It's a question of when and where.

56
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:46,497
Gotcha!

57
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,998
- What?
- You didn't make the noise. You didn't say the words.

58
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,964
- No, I killed you.
- I shot you in the back.

59
00:06:50,997 --> 00:06:52,831
- You're hit. I got you!
- Uh-uh.

60
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:54,864
No, I got you, I killed you!

61
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:56,531
You did not make the noise.

62
00:06:56,564 --> 00:06:59,597
Boys. Boys!

63
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,031
Did you guys take those
out of their packages?

64
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:04,731
No. They were in a bin like this.

65
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:05,898
You're putting 'em back.

66
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:11,030
Pick out your cereal.

67
00:07:18,497 --> 00:07:20,698
Dude, these are so much better than yours.

68
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,799
Yeah, but these are healthy.

69
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:23,097
You're supposed to pick sugar,

70
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:24,766
that's the whole point of cereal.

71
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,998
No, no. One box each.

72
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,730
- They all look so good.
- Can we get two each?

73
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:37,432
No.

74
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:40,931
You boys stay close, okay?

75
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:42,965
Okay.

76
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,665
What is it, Mom?

77
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:07,998
You boys remember what to do

78
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,898
when Mama says "rutabaga", right?

79
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,830
We run.

80
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:13,931
Yeah, and stay close together.

81
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:24,730
Rutabaga.

82
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:27,299
Rutabaga!

83
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:37,364
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey!

84
00:08:37,398 --> 00:08:39,397
Wait, wait a minute. Slow down!

85
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,731
- Dylan!
- What's wrong?

86
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:43,699
That man back there just
touched one of my boys.

87
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,498
Hey, son. You need to step back.

88
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,299
What'd she tell you?

89
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:58,597
Seatbelts.

90
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,665
Yeah.

91
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:08,766
Yeah, it's her, all right.

92
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,332
Race you inside.

93
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:25,830
What?

94
00:09:31,065 --> 00:09:32,931
Dylan?

95
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:35,564
You okay?

96
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,331
What is it?

97
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:47,398
Okay, well, I think I'm gonna
go finish up work for a bit.

98
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:49,331
You think you can make
dinner with your brother?

99
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,564
Okay.

100
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:54,431
Hey.

101
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:56,031
You did good today.

102
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,965
Yeah, hi, I'm calling
about the Jacobs property.

103
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:15,698
Yeah, I'm looking at the listing.

104
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:18,598
Uh, is it still available?

105
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:20,397
Oh, it is.

106
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:21,930
Okay. No, that's great.

107
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:26,030
My clients are gonna be
very, very happy about that.

108
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:29,864
Yes, they, um... they
are aware of the incident.

109
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,097
Yeah, their only question is

110
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,897
has anyone lived on
the property since then?

111
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:38,465
No one.

112
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,031
It's been vacant for that long?

113
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:46,565
Okay. No, no, I'll, um...

114
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:48,097
I'll let them know.

115
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:49,898
Okay, thanks.

116
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Mom.

117
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,365
Yeah, sweetie?

118
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:26,097
- Dinner.
- Okay.

119
00:12:26,131 --> 00:12:27,612
I'll be... I'll be there in a minute.

120
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,130
Dylan?

121
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:38,564
You okay, baby? What's wrong?

122
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:42,665
Nothing.

123
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:48,065
Hey, Dylan. It's just
an old building, baby.

124
00:12:55,497 --> 00:12:57,964
I know.

125
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:10,065
How long are we gonna be out here?

126
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:14,331
Not long. I promise.

127
00:13:14,365 --> 00:13:16,665
I'm worried about Dylan.

128
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,430
Why?

129
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,830
He's just...

130
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:22,430
different out here.

131
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:26,031
Yeah, well...

132
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:29,431
he'll come around. He will.

133
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:31,765
But he's gonna need a
little help from his brother.

134
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:34,564
Do you think you're up for it?

135
00:13:36,597 --> 00:13:37,931
Good.

136
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:43,365
'Cause I really can't do this alone.

137
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:45,565
I need my boys.

138
00:13:45,597 --> 00:13:47,698
Good night.

139
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:49,698
Sweet dreams.

140
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:16,564
- Hi, Milo.
- Hi, Dylan.

141
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:18,531
What are you doing here?

142
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:20,098
I have something to show you.

143
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,465
I'm supposed to be asleep.

144
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,797
Your mom just started working.

145
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,698
She'll be out there for hours.

146
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,430
What if she comes back?

147
00:14:31,962 --> 00:14:33,697
She won't.

148
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,697
- How do you know?
- I just know.

149
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,330
Do you trust me?

150
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,964
What's down there?

151
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:02,830
You'll see.

152
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:16,631
It's back there.

153
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:22,598
Come on.

154
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,965
Should I open it?

155
00:15:51,763 --> 00:15:52,897
What's on them?

156
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,665
There's only one way to find out.

157
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:03,530
How'd you know this was here?

158
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:06,897
This is where I left it.

159
00:16:28,897 --> 00:16:31,764
Hey, Ted. What are you doing here?

160
00:16:31,797 --> 00:16:34,865
Milo said he was gonna show you the thing.

161
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:43,698
This one's mine.

162
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

163
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,930
We shouldn't be watching this.

164
00:18:26,963 --> 00:18:29,364
Turn it off, Milo. Let's get...

165
00:18:29,397 --> 00:18:30,531
Shh.

166
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:47,863
What the hell?

167
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:53,998
Uh...

168
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,998
Mom!

169
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,765
Mom!

170
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:04,497
- Hey!
- Whoa, hold on, ma'am.

171
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:06,331
No, no, no. This is private property.

172
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:08,097
Wait, wait, wait! No, I was
told the house was for sale.

173
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:09,664
The listing said it was available.

174
00:20:09,696 --> 00:20:11,563
Doesn't give you a right to be out here.

175
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:13,564
You're trespassing and you know
it. What are you doing here?

176
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:15,564
I'm a private investigator.

177
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:18,596
- Oh, you son of a bitch.
- What?

178
00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:21,431
- How the fuck did you find me?
- Hold on, what?

179
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:23,463
Was that your partner back
there at the grocery store?

180
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:24,964
Partner? No, I work alone.

181
00:20:24,997 --> 00:20:27,064
You listen to me, okay? You listen to me.

182
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:29,065
- Okay.
- You are not taking them.

183
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:31,830
He is not taking them,
do you understand me?

184
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,998
- Okay.
- I don't care who his friends are.

185
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:36,331
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

186
00:20:36,364 --> 00:20:38,663
Good, okay.

187
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:46,331
Okay, you look like a reasonable man.

188
00:20:46,364 --> 00:20:48,029
You do. Are you a reasonable man?

189
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:49,997
Um...

190
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,596
I mean, yeah, I guess.

191
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,864
What's it gonna take?

192
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:56,029
I mean...

193
00:20:56,063 --> 00:20:59,463
What is he paying you?

194
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,497
I don't have a lot, but I...

195
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:03,963
I will pay you what I have

196
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:06,630
to make sure that you never saw us, okay?

197
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:10,730
So just tell me what it's gonna take.

198
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,364
Coffee.

199
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:15,764
Excuse me?

200
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:18,797
A cup of coffee. It's
been a really long trip,

201
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:21,463
and I think that there has
been a huge misunderstanding.

202
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,998
Um... have you ever heard

203
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:33,963
of someone named Ellison Oswalt?

204
00:21:33,996 --> 00:21:36,064
Yeah. Yeah, who hasn't heard about that.

205
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:37,531
That was terrible what happened.

206
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:38,897
Mr. Oswalt was a friend of mine.

207
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,663
I was helping him on his
book that he was writing

208
00:21:40,697 --> 00:21:42,664
- about the case...
- Oh, so...

209
00:21:42,697 --> 00:21:45,531
Are you here 'cause of
what happened at the church?

210
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:46,630
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:21:46,664 --> 00:21:48,463
You think they're related?

212
00:21:48,497 --> 00:21:49,964
No, they...

213
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:51,863
The crimes share a lot of similarities.

214
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:54,664
I'm just following up on
cold cases that look similar.

215
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:56,763
Hmm. How's there any money in that?

216
00:21:56,797 --> 00:21:59,030
There's not, really.

217
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:01,864
But fortunately, there's always somebody

218
00:22:01,897 --> 00:22:03,730
that needs a private detective

219
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:05,930
to check in on a spouse or an employee,

220
00:22:05,964 --> 00:22:08,029
- so when I'm not doing that...
- You do this.

221
00:22:08,064 --> 00:22:09,631
Yeah.

222
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:12,364
Uh...

223
00:22:14,464 --> 00:22:17,431
Have you ever seen
anything on your property

224
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:18,829
that looks like this?

225
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,730
No.

226
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:34,431
Mmm. You weren't supposed to be here.

227
00:22:34,464 --> 00:22:36,497
I was told that this place was empty.

228
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:39,029
Right. My friend Jillian,
her dad owns the land now,

229
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:41,531
and when things between my
husband and I went south,

230
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:43,363
she was nice enough to put us up here,

231
00:22:43,397 --> 00:22:46,330
but she told me that
nobody ever comes out here.

232
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:50,029
Oh, so... So the boys, is that...

233
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:51,697
Do you have legal custody, or is that...

234
00:22:51,729 --> 00:22:54,029
I do, yes. It's, uh...

235
00:22:54,062 --> 00:22:55,863
It's temporary, though.

236
00:22:55,896 --> 00:22:57,630
Well, look, you...

237
00:22:57,662 --> 00:22:59,764
You're welcome to stay
awhile and look around,

238
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:03,597
- whatever you need.
- No, it's getting late.

239
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:06,763
You don't want to creep around
a murder scene in the dark, huh?

240
00:23:06,797 --> 00:23:08,630
No, ma'am.

241
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:10,496
In all honesty, I do not.

242
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,664
- It's Courtney.
- Okay, Courtney.

243
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:15,562
Do you mind if I come back here tomorrow

244
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:16,564
and have a look around?

245
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,963
No, but on one condition.

246
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:21,497
- Anything.
- Nobody gets to know that we're here.

247
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,965
No one.

248
00:23:25,096 --> 00:23:26,596
I don't know who I'd tell.

249
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:28,464
Good.

250
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:46,698
Goddamn it. Damn it!

251
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:51,996
<i>Karen! Karen?</i>

252
00:23:58,597 --> 00:24:00,930
Boys, let's, uh...

253
00:24:00,964 --> 00:24:02,463
Let's get ready for bed.

254
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:04,897
Brush your teeth.

255
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,764
Can we just watch till the next commercial?

256
00:24:06,796 --> 00:24:09,729
- No, now.
- Come on!

257
00:24:09,763 --> 00:24:11,097
I don't like it when you boys

258
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:12,863
watch stuff like that before bed, okay?

259
00:24:12,896 --> 00:24:15,029
It's not real, Mom. It's
okay if it's not real.

260
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:16,630
Yeah, but it'll still give you nightmares.

261
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:17,729
So let's go, come on.

262
00:24:17,764 --> 00:24:20,763
Brush your teeth.

263
00:24:20,797 --> 00:24:22,596
What did that man want today?

264
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,431
- Uh...
- Was he one of Daddy's friends?

265
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,562
No, no, no. He was just
looking for something.

266
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:30,364
Was he here about
what happened in the church?

267
00:24:30,396 --> 00:24:32,829
What do you mean what
happened in the church?

268
00:24:32,864 --> 00:24:34,564
We know about the church, Mom.

269
00:24:34,596 --> 00:24:36,530
We're not stupid.

270
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:46,397
Hey, who told you two about
what happened in the church?

271
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:48,597
We just heard about it.

272
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:50,097
Yeah, everyone knows.

273
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:51,763
All right, well, I don't want you two

274
00:24:51,797 --> 00:24:53,596
thinking about that, okay?

275
00:24:53,629 --> 00:24:57,498
Dylan? Is that why you're
afraid of the church, baby?

276
00:24:59,763 --> 00:25:01,662
You don't have to worry about that, okay?

277
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,616
There's nothing in that
church that can hurt you.

278
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:07,430
Hey! Hey, you guys.

279
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,364
Hey, hey, okay, okay.

280
00:25:09,396 --> 00:25:11,997
Okay, okay, come on.
Brush your teeth, let's go.

281
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:14,030
What happened in the church?

282
00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:35,562
What?

283
00:25:35,597 --> 00:25:37,498
What the...

284
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:42,363
What...

285
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What?

286
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

287
00:26:34,628 --> 00:26:38,029
Come on. Let's watch another.

288
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:41,430
No, I don't want to watch any more of them.

289
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:11,929
Hi, Emma.

290
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:17,397
Are you having the dreams?

291
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:18,796
We all had the dreams.

292
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,696
The movies make the dreams go away.

293
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,497
Once you watch them all,

294
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:25,463
you never have a bad dream again.

295
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:26,662
For real?

296
00:28:26,696 --> 00:28:28,797
Swear.

297
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:56,929
Let's watch another.

298
00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:01,564
No. I don't wanna watch any more movies.

299
00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:03,496
But you have to.

300
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:05,030
You haven't watched the best ones yet.

301
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:08,829
Besides, you won't have
any more bad dreams tonight.

302
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:10,697
Or tomorrow if you watch another.

303
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,364
Good night, Milo.

304
00:30:29,497 --> 00:30:30,997
You aren't so special, you know.

305
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,496
- What?
- I can see them too.

306
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You aren't so special.
Aren't you gonna say anything?

307
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,729
Hey, answer me. Pussy.

308
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,730
Zachary Collins, what did
you just call your brother?

309
00:30:50,764 --> 00:30:52,530
- Nothing.
- Don't you tell me "nothing".

310
00:30:56,596 --> 00:30:57,829
Okay, remember what I told you boys?

311
00:30:57,863 --> 00:30:59,564
Speak only when spoken to,

312
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:01,765
and tell you what he asks us.

313
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:15,463
So here it is.

314
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:18,961
The scene of the crime.

315
00:31:18,996 --> 00:31:20,963
So how were they killed? Do you know?

316
00:31:20,995 --> 00:31:22,763
Unfortunately, I do.

317
00:31:22,795 --> 00:31:24,696
Tell me.

318
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:28,496
Trust me, you don't want to know.

319
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:32,496
Uh...

320
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:34,463
I'm gonna look around in
here for a few minutes.

321
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:37,064
I'm gonna compare the space to
some of the crime scene photos.

322
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:39,330
Yeah, sure. Uh, please.

323
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:40,996
Come back to the house
if you have any questions.

324
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,896
I will.

325
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:43,930
Thanks.

326
00:31:48,062 --> 00:31:50,298
Okay.

327
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

328
00:34:16,496 --> 00:34:18,430
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

329
00:34:19,762 --> 00:34:21,697
Oh.

330
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

331
00:35:10,097 --> 00:35:12,697
Come on.

332
00:35:17,562 --> 00:35:19,063
What?

333
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

334
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:30,495
Oh!

335
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:32,530
Hello?

336
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,097
- Deputy?
- <i>Well, I'm not really on the force anymore.</i>

337
00:35:35,129 --> 00:35:37,730
No, right. Of course, I'm sorry.

338
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:39,429
<i>Who is this?</i>

339
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:42,429
I'm Dr. Stromberg. We
spoke a few months back.

340
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,729
<i>You're like, the new
Professor Jonas or something?</i>

341
00:35:44,763 --> 00:35:46,730
God, I hope not.

342
00:35:46,763 --> 00:35:48,562
Jonas is missing.

343
00:35:48,596 --> 00:35:51,797
<i>The police
just called off the search.</i>

344
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,396
Well, what happened to him?

345
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:55,797
<i>Look, I need you to, uh...</i>

346
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,596
<i>to come out here as
soon as possible.</i>

347
00:35:57,629 --> 00:36:00,595
Uh, I'm a little tied up
with something right now.

348
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:03,997
Look, Jonas left...

349
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:08,496
he left something behind.
Something unbelievable.

350
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:10,530
<i>I think it could be
the key to all of this.</i>

351
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:12,029
Then tell me.

352
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:14,896
No. No, no, no. I can't-I can't risk that.

353
00:36:14,928 --> 00:36:17,796
- Not on the phone.
- Okay.

354
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,663
- I'll be there tomorrow.
- <i>Yeah, okay, that's good.</i>

355
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:21,529
<i>Great, thank you.</i>

356
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:07,696
Hey.

357
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,430
Dylan, right?

358
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:22,064
How do you like it out here?

359
00:37:22,097 --> 00:37:23,463
Be better if I didn't live

360
00:37:23,496 --> 00:37:25,630
where so many people got killed.

361
00:37:29,462 --> 00:37:31,729
So how you dealing with that?

362
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:36,729
I get it.

363
00:37:36,761 --> 00:37:39,696
I'd be scared too.

364
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,561
And I'd have nightmares
in a place like this.

365
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:46,863
You having nightmares?

366
00:37:48,663 --> 00:37:50,863
Yeah.

367
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:54,730
Yeah, I have really bad
dreams too sometimes.

368
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:56,862
About dead people?

369
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,663
A friend.

370
00:38:05,364 --> 00:38:06,797
What do you do?

371
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:08,663
To stop the dreams.

372
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:14,797
Well, when I'm awake, I try to help people.

373
00:38:14,828 --> 00:38:18,828
You know, make the real world
a little less like the dreams.

374
00:38:22,129 --> 00:38:23,963
You let me know if the dreams start to feel

375
00:38:23,995 --> 00:38:25,796
a little too real, you know?

376
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:30,530
I'm pretty good at dealing with nightmares.

377
00:38:38,395 --> 00:38:39,996
Oh, no.

378
00:38:53,128 --> 00:38:54,463
You cut your hair.

379
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:56,395
Bastard.

380
00:38:56,428 --> 00:38:57,797
How dare you show up here?

381
00:39:01,495 --> 00:39:03,929
What the fuck is this?

382
00:39:03,963 --> 00:39:06,963
I told you this would happen.
Told you I'd come for 'em.

383
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:09,996
No, no, this is bullshit.
You don't have a court order.

384
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:11,796
- You can't do this.
- Step aside, ma'am.

385
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:14,629
You need a court order.
Boys, get back in the house!

386
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:16,028
- Step aside.
- Get back.

387
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:17,797
- Ma'am...
- No, you can't do this!

388
00:39:17,828 --> 00:39:19,928
- You need to step...
- Let's see the order.

389
00:39:19,963 --> 00:39:23,029
Step aside, sir. Now.

390
00:39:23,062 --> 00:39:24,530
Who's the officer in charge?

391
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,064
I'm in charge, asshole.

392
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:28,463
Okay, okay, Officer...

393
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:30,530
Shermer. Where's the sheriff?

394
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:32,595
We're state troopers.
We don't have a sheriff.

395
00:39:32,629 --> 00:39:34,897
- Now if you could...
- I know, I know. I can read the car.

396
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:36,430
I know that you're state troopers.

397
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:39,761
But I also know that
child custody transfers

398
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,463
is the responsibility of the sheriff.

399
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:43,696
And I can tell you from experience

400
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:45,796
that the only reasons that
the sheriff isn't here today

401
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:47,530
is because he either doesn't know about it,

402
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:48,961
or he doesn't want to know.

403
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:51,461
So, you want to call him? You know what?

404
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:53,463
I'll call, I got it. Don't worry about it.

405
00:39:53,496 --> 00:39:54,863
Sir, put the phone away
or I'm gonna throw you

406
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,763
in the back of the car myself.

407
00:39:56,796 --> 00:39:58,629
Are you saying that you'd arrest me?

408
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,596
In a heartbeat.

409
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:04,863
Well, then I should probably inform you

410
00:40:04,896 --> 00:40:08,797
that I was arrested a few years
ago on a big capital offense.

411
00:40:08,828 --> 00:40:12,595
It was a major news story.
All the charges were dropped.

412
00:40:12,629 --> 00:40:15,028
But if I were to be arrested again,

413
00:40:15,061 --> 00:40:18,728
that'd be pretty big news. Yeah.

414
00:40:18,763 --> 00:40:21,463
Whew! If the press got a hold of it...

415
00:40:21,495 --> 00:40:25,095
Ugh. I would hate to be the uniform

416
00:40:25,129 --> 00:40:27,729
that was trying to make a child abduction

417
00:40:27,763 --> 00:40:33,363
look like a custody transfer.
State cars and everything?

418
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:36,361
That just might be the
worst day of that guy's life.

419
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:37,395
Sir.

420
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:44,530
- Let's go.
- Gary? Hey.

421
00:40:44,563 --> 00:40:46,095
I'm not leaving without my boys.

422
00:40:46,128 --> 00:40:48,561
Look, that douche canoe
over there is right.

423
00:40:48,595 --> 00:40:50,696
We don't have any legal
authority to be here.

424
00:40:50,728 --> 00:40:52,761
He called our bluff.

425
00:40:52,796 --> 00:40:54,663
I'm sorry, I can't lose my job over this.

426
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:55,696
I got kids too.

427
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:04,362
This isn't over.

428
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:05,396
Whore.

429
00:41:21,628 --> 00:41:23,729
Thank you.

430
00:41:23,763 --> 00:41:26,028
Thank you so much for doing that.

431
00:41:26,061 --> 00:41:30,429
It's, uh... it's really no problem.

432
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:31,595
We gotta get outta here.

433
00:41:31,627 --> 00:41:33,761
What? No, no... No.

434
00:41:33,796 --> 00:41:35,496
- No, no, you, um...
- What?

435
00:41:35,528 --> 00:41:37,028
You can't leave.

436
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:40,629
- Why?
- Uh, did you, um...

437
00:41:40,663 --> 00:41:43,062
Did you have a restraining order?

438
00:41:43,096 --> 00:41:44,896
No. No.

439
00:41:44,929 --> 00:41:46,829
He had too many character witnesses.

440
00:41:46,863 --> 00:41:47,996
I was lucky I got custody.

441
00:41:48,028 --> 00:41:50,595
You have to stay because those officers

442
00:41:50,628 --> 00:41:52,663
can testify that they saw you here today,

443
00:41:52,696 --> 00:41:56,361
and if you leave overnight, then...

444
00:41:56,395 --> 00:41:58,529
he will have a case that
you're a flight risk.

445
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:01,596
And he could get the boys.

446
00:42:01,628 --> 00:42:03,829
Yeah. Yeah, he could.

447
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:08,629
But you saw him.

448
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:10,496
He'll come back.

449
00:42:12,961 --> 00:42:14,063
Will you stay?

450
00:42:16,795 --> 00:42:19,461
Maybe just... for dinner?

451
00:42:20,962 --> 00:42:22,664
Sure.

452
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:41,829
Sorry, I, uh...

453
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:44,962
They're used to...

454
00:42:44,994 --> 00:42:46,595
Clint always ate first.

455
00:42:46,628 --> 00:42:49,595
Well, I'm not Clint, so go ahead, eat.

456
00:42:54,928 --> 00:42:58,828
So, were you a cop or something?

457
00:42:58,861 --> 00:43:00,595
Oh, yeah.

458
00:43:00,627 --> 00:43:02,528
A sheriff's deputy.

459
00:43:02,561 --> 00:43:03,861
So you saw dead bodies and stuff?

460
00:43:03,894 --> 00:43:05,596
- Zachary.
- What?

461
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:06,961
Cops see dead bodies.

462
00:43:06,994 --> 00:43:09,395
That's okay. Um... Yeah, I did.

463
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:10,995
More than I'd like.

464
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:13,628
- Did you catch...
- Did you catch a lot of bad guys?

465
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:18,629
Uh, not bad guys. Just people.

466
00:43:18,661 --> 00:43:20,862
Having bad days.

467
00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:23,029
But you're not a cop anymore.

468
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:24,996
- No.
- Why not?

469
00:43:25,029 --> 00:43:27,529
Uh...

470
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,796
Because I got tired of seeing
people on their bad days.

471
00:43:32,762 --> 00:43:34,329
I think you're good at dealing with people

472
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,928
on their bad days.

473
00:43:36,963 --> 00:43:38,397
Thanks.

474
00:43:55,063 --> 00:43:56,862
Uh, thanks. Thanks for dinner.

475
00:43:56,895 --> 00:43:58,596
You don't have to leave.

476
00:43:58,627 --> 00:44:01,028
No, I... I have a really
long drive in the morning,

477
00:44:01,061 --> 00:44:04,095
and it's... it's dark.

478
00:44:04,129 --> 00:44:06,461
Does this place really spook you that much?

479
00:44:06,495 --> 00:44:08,795
No, it's not like that.

480
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:11,362
Yes, it really does.

481
00:44:11,396 --> 00:44:13,696
It's really no problem.
I can fix up the couch.

482
00:44:13,728 --> 00:44:16,296
- No...
- Please stay.

483
00:44:33,696 --> 00:44:35,429
Oh, shi...

484
00:44:42,994 --> 00:44:45,329
What the hell am I doing here?

485
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

486
00:45:27,628 --> 00:45:29,829
Jesus Christ.

487
00:45:36,095 --> 00:45:37,395
You can't sleep, huh?

488
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:43,862
No.

489
00:45:45,527 --> 00:45:47,529
Do you smoke?

490
00:45:47,561 --> 00:45:49,929
Uh... no.

491
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:53,329
Not really, um... This
is a secret cigarette,

492
00:45:53,361 --> 00:45:55,496
- 'cause I'm a secret smoker.
- Gotcha.

493
00:45:55,528 --> 00:45:56,863
You can't say anything to my boys.

494
00:45:56,895 --> 00:45:58,495
They don't know.

495
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:01,661
Okay, sure. I don't know when I would.

496
00:46:01,694 --> 00:46:04,361
I'm not their dad. That's weird.

497
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:06,329
That is weird.

498
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:07,929
Don't say that.

499
00:46:07,961 --> 00:46:10,361
It's like, oh, well, I wish you were.

500
00:46:16,661 --> 00:46:19,028
Was that true today what you said earlier,

501
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,561
about getting arrested?

502
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:24,496
Yeah. It's true.

503
00:46:24,528 --> 00:46:27,729
You didn't do it... did you?

504
00:46:27,763 --> 00:46:31,096
No, no. God, no. No,
it's nothing like that.

505
00:46:32,862 --> 00:46:34,961
That writer I was telling
you about, Ellison Oswalt.

506
00:46:34,994 --> 00:46:36,561
He's a friend of mine.

507
00:46:36,595 --> 00:46:38,395
I gave him some files and some information,

508
00:46:38,427 --> 00:46:40,395
even after my boss told me not to.

509
00:46:40,427 --> 00:46:42,395
And since I was the last
person to talk to him,

510
00:46:42,428 --> 00:46:44,729
and the only other person
they saw coming and going

511
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:47,763
from his home, I was a really easy suspect.

512
00:46:47,795 --> 00:46:49,496
I was cleared of all the charges.

513
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:51,629
Your boss was pissed 'cause
you went behind his back.

514
00:46:51,662 --> 00:46:53,595
Yeah. Yeah.

515
00:46:53,628 --> 00:46:55,496
Fired me the day that I was cleared.

516
00:46:58,096 --> 00:47:00,929
You miss it, huh?

517
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,529
Most days.

518
00:47:03,561 --> 00:47:05,961
- Yeah, I do.
- Mmm.

519
00:47:08,463 --> 00:47:10,029
Can I ask you something?

520
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,995
Sure.

521
00:47:12,028 --> 00:47:13,361
Ask away.

522
00:47:15,496 --> 00:47:16,496
Was it Dylan?

523
00:47:16,527 --> 00:47:18,296
What do you mean?

524
00:47:20,695 --> 00:47:22,528
That he hit.

525
00:47:26,128 --> 00:47:27,396
How could you tell?

526
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:31,995
It's just that he reminds me of me.

527
00:47:34,763 --> 00:47:37,562
Clint beat him real bad.

528
00:47:37,594 --> 00:47:39,861
He sent him to the emergency room.

529
00:47:43,795 --> 00:47:45,595
All his cop buddies
weren't gonna do anything.

530
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:47,562
So you left.

531
00:47:49,695 --> 00:47:50,695
Yeah.

532
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,861
So what's the plan?

533
00:47:54,894 --> 00:47:57,696
Uh... get the hell out of here.

534
00:47:59,761 --> 00:48:02,095
Know where you're gonna go?

535
00:48:02,128 --> 00:48:04,297
Far as I can.

536
00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:08,328
What are you gonna do?

537
00:48:08,362 --> 00:48:09,763
Get a job, I guess.

538
00:48:09,794 --> 00:48:12,594
- Yeah, furniture stuff?
- Yeah.

539
00:48:12,628 --> 00:48:14,461
- Yeah, I saw inside the church.
- Yeah.

540
00:48:14,495 --> 00:48:15,861
- It's really cool.
- Thank you.

541
00:48:15,895 --> 00:48:19,729
It's antique restoration, actually.

542
00:48:19,761 --> 00:48:23,495
It feels almost magical
to turn something worn out

543
00:48:23,527 --> 00:48:25,761
into something that's...

544
00:48:25,795 --> 00:48:27,829
something that's beautiful again, you know?

545
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:32,395
Like, polished and worthwhile.

546
00:48:32,427 --> 00:48:36,628
Something that's gonna be
here long after you're gone.

547
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,629
Yeah.

548
00:48:38,663 --> 00:48:39,663
Like kids.

549
00:48:42,995 --> 00:48:45,029
Yeah, like kids.

550
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:02,396
Come on.

551
00:49:02,428 --> 00:49:03,829
I don't want to.

552
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:07,428
I want to go back to sleep.

553
00:49:07,461 --> 00:49:09,329
Sweet dreams.

554
00:49:14,929 --> 00:49:17,728
This one's mine.

555
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:21,861
Just play it.

556
00:51:19,028 --> 00:51:20,996
I know you're there.

557
00:51:24,527 --> 00:51:26,027
Why'd you have to pick him?

558
00:51:26,061 --> 00:51:29,027
Because you're not good
enough to be one of us.

559
00:51:30,761 --> 00:51:33,329
You're not smart enough
to do what he can do.

560
00:51:33,362 --> 00:51:35,861
Uh-uh. I'm better than
him. I'm smarter too.

561
00:51:35,894 --> 00:51:39,394
If you were, then we would have chosen you.

562
00:51:39,427 --> 00:51:44,463
Tell anyone of this,
and he'll take you first,

563
00:51:44,494 --> 00:51:46,095
then kill your whole family.

564
00:51:46,128 --> 00:51:47,296
Who, Dylan?

565
00:51:49,961 --> 00:51:51,695
Then who?

566
00:51:53,628 --> 00:51:56,594
Okay. Okay.

567
00:51:56,627 --> 00:51:58,562
Okay, okay.

568
00:51:58,594 --> 00:51:59,761
Ooh!

569
00:51:59,794 --> 00:52:00,895
- I can...
- Shh.

570
00:52:00,928 --> 00:52:03,562
Now, listen up. Listen up.

571
00:52:03,595 --> 00:52:06,061
- I live alone, so...
- Shh. Okay.

572
00:52:06,096 --> 00:52:08,696
My God, I have to go to bed.

573
00:52:08,729 --> 00:52:10,329
I have to go to sleep.

574
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:11,561
Okay.

575
00:52:24,527 --> 00:52:26,395
It's been so long since I felt safe.

576
00:52:28,695 --> 00:52:29,928
Sorry.

577
00:52:29,961 --> 00:52:31,963
No, don't... it's not sorry.

578
00:52:36,395 --> 00:52:40,494
I, um... I need to go to bed.

579
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:42,628
Yeah. Yeah, tomorrow...

580
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,594
I have... Um... I have a long...

581
00:52:45,627 --> 00:52:48,027
- I have a long drive tomorrow.
- Okay, okay.

582
00:52:48,061 --> 00:52:49,494
Are you gonna be okay?

583
00:52:49,527 --> 00:52:51,361
- Yeah. Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

584
00:52:51,395 --> 00:52:53,394
- Okay.
- Okay.

585
00:52:53,427 --> 00:52:54,394
Okay, good night, Courtney.

586
00:52:54,428 --> 00:52:55,561
Good night.

587
00:53:12,463 --> 00:53:13,561
Hey!

588
00:53:14,694 --> 00:53:16,062
Oh, hey.

589
00:53:19,894 --> 00:53:21,394
Got you this for the road.

590
00:53:21,428 --> 00:53:23,961
You didn't have to do that. Really. Thanks.

591
00:53:23,995 --> 00:53:25,996
You're going to
have to bring that back, though.

592
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:27,696
Oh, I promise. I'll be back tomorrow.

593
00:53:27,728 --> 00:53:29,795
But... But listen.

594
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:32,362
Whatever you do, don't...
don't leave the house. Okay?

595
00:53:32,395 --> 00:53:33,429
Trust me.

596
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:34,795
Okay.

597
00:53:34,828 --> 00:53:36,795
Okay. All right, and I
left my number inside.

598
00:53:36,828 --> 00:53:39,361
Yeah, I got it. That's mine.

599
00:53:39,394 --> 00:53:40,960
So call me when you get there safe

600
00:53:40,994 --> 00:53:42,828
and if you need anything.

601
00:53:42,861 --> 00:53:46,661
Yeah, okay. Um, same deal.

602
00:53:46,695 --> 00:53:47,761
Okay.

603
00:53:47,795 --> 00:53:48,828
- Okay.
- Okay.

604
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,961
- I'll see ya.
- See ya.

605
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,960
"Same deal"?

606
00:53:57,995 --> 00:53:59,996
Same deal.

607
00:54:00,027 --> 00:54:01,461
Jesus.

608
00:54:13,494 --> 00:54:14,660
Sorry. Uh, thanks.

609
00:54:14,694 --> 00:54:16,027
Oh, yeah, sure, man.

610
00:54:16,061 --> 00:54:18,329
Uh, so, uh...

611
00:54:18,363 --> 00:54:19,796
I'm not really sure...

612
00:54:19,828 --> 00:54:21,328
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

613
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:22,795
Uh, just a little too much coffee.

614
00:54:22,828 --> 00:54:24,361
Um, you wanna take a seat?

615
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,695
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

616
00:54:25,728 --> 00:54:28,927
Great. Um, here, uh...

617
00:54:31,761 --> 00:54:34,560
Look, I really appreciate
you making the trip.

618
00:54:34,594 --> 00:54:35,729
You're helping me.

619
00:54:35,761 --> 00:54:36,961
Yeah.

620
00:54:36,994 --> 00:54:37,960
You want a drink?

621
00:54:37,995 --> 00:54:40,394
No, that's okay.

622
00:54:40,427 --> 00:54:42,560
I'm going to have a drink. Cheers.

623
00:54:42,595 --> 00:54:47,595
Um... what is all of this about?

624
00:54:49,095 --> 00:54:51,062
Um...

625
00:54:51,095 --> 00:54:53,595
have you ever seen one of these?

626
00:54:53,628 --> 00:54:55,461
This? Yeah, sure, it's a ham radio.

627
00:54:55,495 --> 00:54:58,828
Oh, great, then you've heard
of the Norwegian bughuul.

628
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:00,896
No.

629
00:55:00,928 --> 00:55:03,660
Um...

630
00:55:03,694 --> 00:55:04,927
years ago,

631
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,494
back in the '70s,

632
00:55:07,527 --> 00:55:09,960
several ham radio enthusiasts,

633
00:55:09,994 --> 00:55:13,594
they ran across a strange transmission.

634
00:55:13,628 --> 00:55:16,828
One night, out of nowhere,

635
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:20,896
on a rarely used band,

636
00:55:20,928 --> 00:55:25,027
this... this children's piano

637
00:55:25,061 --> 00:55:27,561
starts tinkling.

638
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:29,428
And for years... I
mean, this thing would...

639
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,696
it would come and go...

640
00:55:30,728 --> 00:55:33,896
I mean, it became an urban legend

641
00:55:33,927 --> 00:55:37,094
until one day,

642
00:55:37,127 --> 00:55:39,395
in the late '90s...

643
00:55:41,861 --> 00:55:44,395
someone finally caught it on tape.

644
00:55:51,394 --> 00:55:54,860
<i>Eight, nine, nine...</i>

645
00:55:54,895 --> 00:55:57,995
<i>five, zero, zero...</i>

646
00:55:58,028 --> 00:56:01,761
<i>one, zero, seven...</i>

647
00:56:01,795 --> 00:56:05,095
<i>five, one, nine...</i>

648
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:07,629
<i>Stop.</i>

649
00:56:24,661 --> 00:56:26,094
W-What were the numbers?

650
00:56:26,127 --> 00:56:28,629
- Coordinates.
- To where?

651
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:32,760
A house. A farm.

652
00:56:32,795 --> 00:56:35,796
In the middle of Norway, where
an entire family was murdered...

653
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,595
in 1973.

654
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,795
So tell me, this murder...

655
00:56:45,828 --> 00:56:47,028
is there a...

656
00:56:47,061 --> 00:56:48,361
Missing child?

657
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,860
<i>...bughuul...</i>

658
00:57:02,895 --> 00:57:04,961
<i>...bughuul...</i>

659
00:57:04,995 --> 00:57:07,628
Bughuul.

660
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:08,995
Are there other broadcasts like this?

661
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:10,928
There are at least three others like it.

662
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:13,428
Now, this radio I have seen
over with Jonas' things,

663
00:57:13,461 --> 00:57:14,963
along with this map.

664
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,394
But Jonas found the pattern.

665
00:57:22,428 --> 00:57:25,460
Yet the families are only
murdered after they leave the house

666
00:57:25,494 --> 00:57:26,827
where Bughuul found them.

667
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:28,329
That's how I've been stopping it.

668
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,495
I've been burning the houses down.

669
00:57:29,528 --> 00:57:31,062
Wait, so the Oswalt house? That was...

670
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,560
Yeah.

671
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:38,329
The pattern isn't the only
thing that Jonas found.

672
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:43,061
He also realized the piano
was of particular significance.

673
00:57:43,095 --> 00:57:46,628
There are fragments... references...

674
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,796
to Bughuul... the Bogeyman...

675
00:57:49,827 --> 00:57:52,560
across all cultures, over
the centuries, that...

676
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,594
some cultures believed

677
00:57:55,627 --> 00:57:57,528
that it lived in another realm,

678
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,028
reachable only by ritual

679
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,895
or sacrifice.

680
00:58:01,928 --> 00:58:04,961
And others believed that it... it fed

681
00:58:04,994 --> 00:58:06,695
off of the corruption of innocents,

682
00:58:06,727 --> 00:58:09,895
but no matter what,

683
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:12,027
there are always three things in common.

684
00:58:12,061 --> 00:58:13,995
There's a murdered family,

685
00:58:14,028 --> 00:58:15,628
missing children,

686
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,528
and some form of iconological totem

687
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,095
or a thematic offering.

688
00:58:21,128 --> 00:58:23,828
An image, literature, music.

689
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:28,660
Okay, so the murders
are captured through art?

690
00:58:28,695 --> 00:58:30,995
It's aesthetic observance of violence.

691
00:58:35,027 --> 00:58:37,428
But that little girl,

692
00:58:37,461 --> 00:58:39,061
the piano,

693
00:58:39,094 --> 00:58:40,661
what exactly did she say?

694
00:58:42,795 --> 00:58:44,560
It's Norwegian.

695
00:58:44,594 --> 00:58:46,727
She says...

696
00:58:46,761 --> 00:58:52,461
"Quiet, Bughuul can't hear
me over your yelling, Mom."

697
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's the kids.
He gets the kids?

698
00:59:05,561 --> 00:59:07,461
<i>It's the kids.</i>

699
00:59:07,495 --> 00:59:08,928
<i>He gets the kids?</i>

700
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,494
<i>It's the kids... kids...</i>

701
00:59:12,061 --> 00:59:15,761
Okay, you should probably
destroy that thing,

702
00:59:15,795 --> 00:59:16,995
like soon.

703
00:59:17,027 --> 00:59:18,560
Yeah, yeah, I really should.

704
00:59:18,595 --> 00:59:20,528
Listen to me. There's another problem.

705
00:59:21,927 --> 00:59:23,527
I found another house.

706
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:25,696
Then burn it down. Break the chain again.

707
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,429
I can't. It's not that simple.

708
00:59:27,461 --> 00:59:29,062
There's already a family
that's living in there...

709
00:59:29,094 --> 00:59:30,627
a mother and her two...

710
00:59:30,661 --> 00:59:31,761
and her two boys.

711
00:59:31,795 --> 00:59:33,828
Jeez... What... Detective!

712
00:59:39,361 --> 00:59:40,395
Say it!

713
00:59:40,428 --> 00:59:42,027
- Stop it!
- Say it!

714
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,494
Say I'm better than you!

715
00:59:43,527 --> 00:59:45,595
Say it!

716
00:59:45,626 --> 00:59:48,394
Say it! Say it! Say it!

717
00:59:48,427 --> 00:59:49,561
Okay, okay.

718
00:59:49,594 --> 00:59:50,595
You're better than me.

719
00:59:50,627 --> 00:59:51,961
You're better than me.

720
00:59:51,993 --> 00:59:54,095
Say you're nothing.

721
00:59:54,127 --> 00:59:55,594
Say you're weak.

722
00:59:55,627 --> 00:59:57,329
Say they made a mistake.

723
01:00:12,428 --> 01:00:15,329
I hate you. I hate all of you.

724
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,461
I'm telling Mom.

725
01:00:16,495 --> 01:00:17,795
You hear that? I'm telling Mom.

726
01:00:17,828 --> 01:00:20,795
Shh.

727
01:00:26,861 --> 01:00:28,860
You don't deserve that.

728
01:00:28,893 --> 01:00:30,828
You should do something about him.

729
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,460
And your father.

730
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,062
And your mother.

731
01:00:35,627 --> 01:00:37,329
My mother didn't do anything.

732
01:00:40,794 --> 01:00:41,862
Exactly.

733
01:00:55,494 --> 01:00:58,027
Damn it, Zachary!
What were you thinking?

734
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,627
- But Mom!
- "But Mom" what?

735
01:00:59,661 --> 01:01:01,661
Give me one good reason, one good reason,

736
01:01:01,694 --> 01:01:03,661
why it was okay for
you to hit your brother?

737
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:05,760
Never mind. I'm sorry. Okay?

738
01:01:05,794 --> 01:01:08,627
Okay, you t... you tell
that to your brother.

739
01:01:10,561 --> 01:01:11,628
Fuck you, Dylan!

740
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,961
Fuck you too.

741
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:16,460
Cunt.

742
01:01:18,894 --> 01:01:21,528
What, are you going to
hit me now? Like Dad?

743
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,460
Go to your room...

744
01:01:28,495 --> 01:01:30,760
and do not take a single step out

745
01:01:30,793 --> 01:01:31,861
until I say so.

746
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,960
I didn't do anything, Mom.

747
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:39,061
I know, sweetie.

748
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:40,695
Just weak.

749
01:01:40,727 --> 01:01:42,527
You are not weak.

750
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,794
Don't you ever say that
about yourself. Okay?

751
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,461
You're strong.

752
01:01:47,494 --> 01:01:48,728
Okay? You're like me that way.

753
01:01:48,761 --> 01:01:50,061
Zachary, he's just, um...

754
01:01:50,095 --> 01:01:51,394
Like Dad?

755
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:52,695
No, I didn't mean that.

756
01:01:52,728 --> 01:01:55,595
But it's true, and you know it.

757
01:01:55,627 --> 01:01:57,895
Dylan, I'm never going
to let anybody hurt you.

758
01:01:57,927 --> 01:01:59,894
You let him.

759
01:01:59,927 --> 01:02:01,527
And you let Dad.

760
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

761
01:03:13,694 --> 01:03:14,928
You're going to like this one.

762
01:03:17,595 --> 01:03:18,694
It's my favorite.

763
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No. I don't want it. Not today.
It has to be tonight.

764
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:29,060
If we don't do this tonight, then...

765
01:03:29,095 --> 01:03:30,061
Then what?

766
01:03:30,094 --> 01:03:31,694
He'll get real mad at us.

767
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:34,627
You don't want to make him mad.

768
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:38,594
Please, Dylan. This one's mine.

769
01:03:38,627 --> 01:03:39,763
I made it.

770
01:06:55,493 --> 01:06:57,495
This is the last one.

771
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No. No more.
Just... on... more.
No.

772
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Yes!
It's downstairs, Dylan.

773
01:08:04,627 --> 01:08:07,561
Last chance to watch the last movie, Dylan.

774
01:08:10,993 --> 01:08:12,527
No, Mylo.

775
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:17,828
I won't watch any more movies.
I don't want to be like you.

776
01:08:20,994 --> 01:08:22,859
That's fine.

777
01:08:22,894 --> 01:08:24,760
They weren't really meant for you anyway.

778
01:08:25,827 --> 01:08:26,895
What?

779
01:08:28,394 --> 01:08:30,695
You did what we needed you to do.

780
01:09:11,828 --> 01:09:13,928
Zach. Zach.

781
01:09:16,394 --> 01:09:17,960
Zach.

782
01:09:17,993 --> 01:09:19,628
Zach!

783
01:09:19,659 --> 01:09:20,960
Zach!

784
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:21,994
Zach!

785
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,327
Go to bed, Dylan.

786
01:09:33,994 --> 01:09:35,594
Tell anyone,

787
01:09:35,626 --> 01:09:38,560
and we'll kill you and your whole family

788
01:09:38,593 --> 01:09:43,560
and watch the film over and over and over.

789
01:10:16,095 --> 01:10:18,061
What the hell does this say?

790
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:20,594
There was an emergency hearing last night.

791
01:10:20,626 --> 01:10:22,294
Sorry you couldn't be there.

792
01:10:24,059 --> 01:10:26,859
Judge T. Simmons. Tory
Simmons' boys work for you.

793
01:10:26,893 --> 01:10:29,594
Well, you'd be hard-pressed to
find anybody within five counties

794
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:33,027
that doesn't have a
family that works for me.

795
01:10:33,059 --> 01:10:34,759
This isn't right.

796
01:10:34,794 --> 01:10:35,959
This isn't legal.

797
01:10:35,994 --> 01:10:37,628
Oh, you want to ask the sheriff?

798
01:10:42,027 --> 01:10:43,594
Don't...

799
01:10:43,626 --> 01:10:45,794
let the kids see you in cuffs.

800
01:10:45,828 --> 01:10:46,994
You're not taking my boys.

801
01:10:47,027 --> 01:10:48,860
Our boys.

802
01:10:48,893 --> 01:10:50,760
I'm just taking them where they belong.

803
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:54,394
You're welcome to come with me if you like.

804
01:10:54,427 --> 01:10:55,427
Fuck you.

805
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:01,527
Either you can stay here without the boys,

806
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,860
fighting the courts for custody
until you run out on money,

807
01:11:05,893 --> 01:11:08,894
or you can come home with me,

808
01:11:08,926 --> 01:11:11,827
spend all the time in the world with them,

809
01:11:11,859 --> 01:11:15,593
making cute little tables and chairs.

810
01:11:15,627 --> 01:11:17,926
Either way, I'm taking them.

811
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,628
Dylan, I need you to pack
your stuff quickly, okay?

812
01:11:29,659 --> 01:11:31,660
Honey, the police are downstairs,

813
01:11:31,693 --> 01:11:33,393
and if you don't come out on your own,

814
01:11:33,427 --> 01:11:34,659
then they're going to come up here.

815
01:11:34,694 --> 01:11:35,994
Mom, I can't go.

816
01:11:36,027 --> 01:11:37,560
We have to, baby. We have to go.

817
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:38,894
You don't understand.

818
01:11:38,926 --> 01:11:40,527
You don't know what's going to happen.

819
01:11:40,559 --> 01:11:41,527
Nothing's going to happen.

820
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,895
He's going to hurt us.

821
01:11:42,927 --> 01:11:46,594
I don't like this any more than you do.

822
01:11:46,626 --> 01:11:49,327
But I won't let that happen.
I'm going to take care of us.

823
01:11:49,361 --> 01:11:51,593
Now, get your stuff.

824
01:11:51,627 --> 01:11:53,095
Okay?

825
01:11:53,126 --> 01:11:54,460
Come on.

826
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:46,327
No.

827
01:12:47,927 --> 01:12:49,594
No.

828
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:06,795
Fuck.

829
01:13:23,493 --> 01:13:25,360
Smells good.

830
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,995
Come on. Come on.

831
01:13:47,026 --> 01:13:48,559
Pass the mashed potatoes.

832
01:13:58,626 --> 01:13:59,760
Thank you, son.

833
01:14:20,559 --> 01:14:21,860
You haven't touched your food.

834
01:14:23,127 --> 01:14:24,593
I'm not very hungry.

835
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:26,760
Come on, buddy.

836
01:14:26,794 --> 01:14:29,660
I got a big day planned for us tomorrow.

837
01:14:29,694 --> 01:14:31,174
You're going to need all that energy.

838
01:14:33,793 --> 01:14:35,360
Eat!

839
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:41,061
Clint! Stop that now!

840
01:14:58,427 --> 01:14:59,994
Boys have to eat.

841
01:15:09,926 --> 01:15:10,927
I'm sorry.

842
01:15:12,093 --> 01:15:13,595
Okay?

843
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:29,994
Mr. Collins, I know that it's late

844
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,960
but... but I need to speak...

845
01:15:31,992 --> 01:15:34,459
You need to speak with me? Or my wife?

846
01:15:34,494 --> 01:15:35,894
What? no.

847
01:15:35,926 --> 01:15:37,459
No, it's not... it's not like that.

848
01:15:37,493 --> 01:15:38,959
- You don't understand...
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

849
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,394
I understand.

850
01:15:40,426 --> 01:15:42,794
Once you get a piece of a woman like that,

851
01:15:42,826 --> 01:15:44,359
it's hard to shake it off.

852
01:15:44,394 --> 01:15:46,960
Okay, you are in danger.

853
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:49,460
I'm in danger?

854
01:15:49,493 --> 01:15:50,894
Okay, just listen.

855
01:15:52,494 --> 01:15:53,994
I'm in danger? Huh?

856
01:15:54,027 --> 01:15:55,894
Listen.

857
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:58,094
- I'm trying to...
- Say it again!

858
01:15:58,127 --> 01:15:59,460
I'm in danger?

859
01:16:01,659 --> 01:16:02,993
Say it again!

860
01:16:15,859 --> 01:16:18,427
Now...

861
01:16:18,459 --> 01:16:20,759
if you ever try to contact my wife again,

862
01:16:20,793 --> 01:16:23,794
first I'm going to take it out on her hide.

863
01:16:23,827 --> 01:16:25,727
And then I'm going to come and find you,

864
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,395
and I'm going to shoot you.

865
01:16:28,926 --> 01:16:31,860
Am I making myself perfectly fucking clear?

866
01:16:33,859 --> 01:16:36,394
Now, get off my property
while I go fuck my wife.

867
01:17:01,559 --> 01:17:04,694
All right, just stand up straight.

868
01:17:04,726 --> 01:17:07,860
Keep your eyes on the
ball. All right? Ready?

869
01:17:07,892 --> 01:17:08,932
Oh, good, baby.

870
01:17:08,959 --> 01:17:10,559
Come on.

871
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:18,894
Sure they're gonna like this one.

872
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:21,560
Ready? Go for it. Hit the ball.

873
01:17:21,593 --> 01:17:23,694
Jesus, why are your hands like this?

874
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,793
I'm gonna make the best one yet.

875
01:19:26,959 --> 01:19:28,893
Zach?

876
01:19:28,926 --> 01:19:33,094
Is that you? Zach?

877
01:19:33,126 --> 01:19:35,559
Zach! Zach!

878
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,927
Zach! Zach...

879
01:20:42,927 --> 01:20:43,994
Oh, God.

880
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:22,993
Okay, listen. It's me. I'm here.

881
01:21:23,026 --> 01:21:24,626
Just hold still. All right?

882
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:26,060
It's okay. I'm going to get you down.

883
01:21:26,094 --> 01:21:28,094
I'm gonna get you down.

884
01:21:28,127 --> 01:21:30,493
Okay. It's okay. It's okay. I got you.

885
01:21:30,526 --> 01:21:31,627
I got you.

886
01:21:31,659 --> 01:21:33,094
Okay. Give me your hand.

887
01:21:33,127 --> 01:21:34,861
It's okay. Dylan.

888
01:21:39,992 --> 01:21:41,426
Hold still.

889
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:45,359
Okay. You all right?

890
01:21:45,393 --> 01:21:46,559
- Huh?
- Baby.

891
01:21:46,593 --> 01:21:47,893
You better finish this, Zach.

892
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:54,894
Zach!

893
01:21:54,926 --> 01:21:56,360
- No, run! Now!
- Zach!

894
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:37,459
Okay.

895
01:22:37,493 --> 01:22:38,894
Oh!

896
01:22:38,927 --> 01:22:40,560
- It's okay. Hurry.
- I'll tie it. Hold it.

897
01:22:40,593 --> 01:22:43,360
Oh, God!

898
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:54,559
Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

899
01:23:05,093 --> 01:23:08,326
They're here somewhere, Zach.

900
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:09,627
It's time to find them

901
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:10,826
and finish your movie.

902
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,927
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

903
01:23:29,526 --> 01:23:31,727
We gotta get in here. Come on.

It's over, Zach.

01:26:14,626 --> 01:26:15,959
You're not making them a film.

You can never come back.

No, I'm not finished!

925
01:26:59,626 --> 01:27:00,959
It's too late.

926
01:27:00,992 --> 01:27:02,659
You had to kill them all.

Go! Now! Go! Go!

935
