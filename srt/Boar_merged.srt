00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

3
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:40,772
- What the hell happened?
- It was a rabbit.

4
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:43,739
You nearly killed us
for a rabbit?

5
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:47,177
Well, you wouldn't want me
to kill it, would ya?

6
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:49,912
Oh, babe, I don't care about
the stupid little bunny,

7
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,715
you nearly killed us.

8
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,132
What was that?

9
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:14,235
Pigs. Lots of pigs.

10
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:17,970
Oh, look, there's another one,
still trotting along.

11
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:19,873
What are they doing?

12
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,076
I don't know,
maybe something startled them.

13
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:25,044
Yeah, babe, like what?

14
00:05:25,046 --> 00:05:27,448
Maybe there's a hunter
out there.

15
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,223
What the FUCK was that?

16
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:40,026
OK, let's get out of here!

17
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:23,364
- Ah, how's it going, mate?
- Not bad at all, mate.

18
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,400
Did you hear about Bernie?

19
00:06:24,402 --> 00:06:27,068
Bank's trying to foreclose
on the poor bastard.

20
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,238
I heard. Bunch of snot-nosed
assholes, if you ask me.

21
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,372
- Too right.
- They just don't get it.

22
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:33,975
I mean, if they'd get out
of their fancy city offices

23
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,175
and come down here,

24
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,411
they'd understand we're in
the middle of a bloody drought.

25
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:41,348
Hey, mate, the ah, Genny.
The lid.

26
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,083
Anyway, what about yourself,
mate? Knocking a few over?

27
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:45,785
Not even trying, mate.

28
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,186
I've been doing
a bit of fencing.

29
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:49,022
Something's been
tearing the fences down there

30
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:51,224
at old Patterson's farm there.

31
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:53,092
- Oh, yeah.
- Keeping me busy though, eh?

32
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:55,327
Hey, hang on, what's that?

33
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:56,529
Is that Bob?

34
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:59,768
Yeah, that's him.
Look at the old bastard.

35
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,073
Get a fucking job,
youse poofters.

36
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:12,009
Jesus.

37
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:14,511
That old bloody pisspot,

38
00:07:14,513 --> 00:07:16,181
I mean, he shouldn't be
driving around anymore.

39
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:18,582
He reckons the same thing's
happening up at his farm too.

40
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:21,551
- Yeah? What's that?
- Ah, knocked down fences.

41
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:23,387
He's down a few sheep too.

42
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,222
- Yeah?
- Something's killed them, yeah.

43
00:07:25,224 --> 00:07:26,989
What, all nine of them?

44
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:29,125
He's probably stewed 'em up
and forgotten about it.

45
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:30,225
I mean, look at him...

46
00:07:30,227 --> 00:07:32,228
he's a hundred mile
of bad bloody road.

47
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,430
Hey, Gail's daughter works
for the quack.

48
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:35,997
She reckons he's been
diagnosed with dementia,

49
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:38,167
so I wouldn't be
at all surprised.

50
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:40,870
I couldn't give a fuck because
I've got things to do, alright,

51
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:43,270
I've got places to go,
I've got to go to work.

52
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:45,006
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I've got a fair drive ahead.

53
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:46,941
Alright, alright.
See you in the pub though?

54
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,544
Ah, yeah, ah, maybe.
I don't know.

55
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:52,179
Ah, bastard.

56
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:25,412
Brucey!

57
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:28,512
Sure you don't want me
to drive, Bruce?

58
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:30,447
No, no, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

59
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:32,250
- You sure?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

60
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:34,352
Come on, Bruce, just let Robbie
drive for a while.

61
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:36,319
Yeah, maybe that's
a good idea.

62
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:38,388
We'll get in the back
and we'll make out.

63
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,524
Well, that sounds good.
I'll pull over for that.

64
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:41,991
Mum, that's gross.

65
00:08:41,993 --> 00:08:43,559
You are not doing that
while I'm in the car.

66
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:44,627
Well, actually, sweetheart,

67
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:48,298
Bruce and I make out all
the time, even in the car.

68
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,433
- Mm-hm!
- Blah!

69
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:53,270
Yeahhh!

70
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:56,337
Come on, let your parents
have some fun.

71
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,073
We can have the front
to ourselves.

72
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:02,311
Remember when you did that thing
when I was driving to Sydney?

73
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:04,379
Um, you'd better not
be doing that.

74
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:06,013
It's called a blowjob, Mum.

75
00:09:06,015 --> 00:09:07,148
I don't care what it's called,

76
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,216
you don't do that while
you're driving, it's dangerous.

77
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:11,920
I was actually talking about
this other thing that she does.

78
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:13,253
Kind of tickles.

79
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:15,989
- She does it with her tongue.
- She does.

80
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:17,292
You are such an asshole, Bart!

81
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:18,624
Takes one to know one.

82
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,326
Ow! Fucking dick!

83
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:22,496
I wasn't talking about blowjobs,
you little shit.

84
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:24,531
- Oh, guys, stop it!
- Oh, sorry, babe.

85
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,599
OK, cabin fever has officially
set in.

86
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:28,468
I don't know about you guys

87
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,305
but I'm hungry enough to eat the
crotch out of a low-flying duck.

88
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:37,510
What? What the fuck
did he just say?

89
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:40,246
It's the ass
out of a low-flying duck.

90
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:41,478
Robbie!

91
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,715
It sounds so shit
when he says it.

92
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,250
Well, hey, look,
I'm doing the best I can here.

93
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,086
You're trying.

94
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,487
I suggest the next town
we pull over and get some grub.

95
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,691
- Good idea.
- Sounds great, Bruce.

96
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:55,595
You want to stop so you can give
Robbie a little tongue tickle.

97
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:59,697
Hey, Bart. Bart.

98
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,398
Hey, Bart. Bart.

99
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
- WHAT?
- You a virgin?

100
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:06,970
Robert, stop it, OK.

101
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:09,540
He's saving himself for the
right woman, aren't you, baby?

102
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:16,612
Hey, Bart, you can't be a virgin
because your face is fucked.

103
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:18,246
OK, we're pulling over.

104
00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:20,415
- Thank fuck for that.
- Robbie.

105
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,220
Sorry, Deb.

106
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:25,587
Sorry, Deb.

107
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,191
- Morning, possum.
- Morning.

108
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:09,563
Hey, Dad, those folks look
familiar to you?

109
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,133
Oh, look at the ass on that,
would ya, eh?

110
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:19,136
Like two possums fighting
in a paper bag.

111
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:20,404
Dad!

112
00:11:20,406 --> 00:11:22,339
Which reminds me,

113
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:24,674
are those jeans tight enough
on you, do you reckon?

114
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:27,176
Ha, ha, ha.

115
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:28,377
Bugger me.

116
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:29,511
Can you put a leash on it,
old man?

117
00:11:29,513 --> 00:11:31,713
She's way too young for you.
Here.

118
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:33,248
If you can still raise
your sword,

119
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,683
you're still in the fight.

120
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:38,087
Yeah, well, stop your perving
and come give me a hand,

121
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:39,391
it's almost 10 o'clock.

122
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:51,569
- Get a room, you two.
- Ha, ha, I would if I could.

123
00:11:54,636 --> 00:11:55,802
Hi.

124
00:11:55,804 --> 00:11:58,638
Young lady, you wouldn't have
a smoke on you, would you?

125
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,239
Sorry, I don't smoke.

126
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:04,110
Vape then. You look like a lady
who does vapour.

127
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:07,245
No smokes, no vapes.

128
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:08,547
I tell you what, though.

129
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:09,748
Here.

130
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,085
This ought to buy you
a pack of smokes.

131
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:16,724
Oi! Here ya, boss.

132
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:20,594
Cheers, mate.

133
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:23,295
Ernie's the name.

134
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:26,297
Robert. Nice to meet ya.

135
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:29,467
Well, that was
a waste of 20 bucks.

136
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:31,769
And he owns a drilling company.

137
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:34,137
Got to be fucking joking.

138
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:36,439
That was really sweet of you,
baby.

139
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:39,809
You just gave $20 to probably
the richest man in town.

140
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:42,345
Are you mocking me?

141
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:44,650
Maybe he'll give it to charity
or something.

142
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:50,586
- Well, I'll be fucked.
- Will you rein it in?

143
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:52,322
No, no, no, they're familiar.

144
00:12:52,324 --> 00:12:55,190
It's been years
but we do know them.

145
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:58,292
Oh, yeah, well, who are they?
Don't keep me in suspense.

146
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:01,363
Yeah, well, see that blonde
sheila walking with that bloke?

147
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:05,565
Yeah, well, that's Debbie
Monroe, Bernie's sister,

148
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,603
so they'd have to be her kids,
Ella and, ah...

149
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:11,906
- Oh, um, Bart.
- Bart!

150
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:15,877
- Holy shit, haven't they grown!
- Yeah, well, they don't shrink.

151
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,310
I don't know
who the two blokes are.

152
00:13:18,312 --> 00:13:21,213
Hey, didn't Debbie's first
husband leave her or something?

153
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:23,583
Yeah, something like that.

154
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:26,319
So they're obviously going over
to see Bernie.

155
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:29,554
Maybe Debbie's here to help him
keep the farm.

156
00:13:29,556 --> 00:13:31,624
How'd you know about the farm?

157
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:34,526
Dad, I own a pub,
I know everyone's business.

158
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:36,161
Point taken.

159
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:39,231
Hey, look, I'd like to stay here
and chat to you for hours

160
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:40,665
but I've got work to do. Mwah.

161
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:41,700
- Oh.
- See you, possum.

162
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:44,568
Thanks for your help.
I'd be fucked without ya!

163
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:15,897
Watch out!

164
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,498
What the hell, Bruce!

165
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,903
- What was that?
- What a fucking idiot!

166
00:14:21,337 --> 00:14:24,338
- Oh, Jesus.
- Where's my chocolate?

167
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,710
Oh.

168
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:29,909
10-second rule?

169
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,413
OK.

170
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,651
- Can I have some KitKat?
- No.

171
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:23,727
Oh, my God, look at you!

172
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:26,328
Oh, my God!

173
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,430
Oh, I've missed you so much.
Oh, my God!

174
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:30,832
Are you taller?

175
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:33,302
Fuck me, you weren't kidding.
He's a giant.

176
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:35,803
- Your mum's a walking headjob.
- Shh.

177
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:37,438
That's my mother
you're talking about.

178
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,640
Yeah, but look at her.

179
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:41,509
Little Ella bo Bella!

180
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:43,814
Yeah, Uncle Bernie, it's me.

181
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:46,913
Oh, my little buddy!

182
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:48,383
I've missed you so much.

183
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:50,585
- Hey, it's a nice place.
- Yeah.

184
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:54,421
Look at the lambs.
Do you reckon he eats them?

185
00:15:54,423 --> 00:15:58,492
- Yeah, probably.
- And who's this?

186
00:15:58,494 --> 00:16:02,362
Uncle Bernie, this is
my boyfriend, Robert.

187
00:16:02,364 --> 00:16:05,731
Be nice.

188
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:08,566
Hey.

189
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,069
I can crush skulls
with my bare hands.

190
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,838
Nice to meet you.

191
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,474
Nice to meet you too, mate.
Just mucking with you.

192
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,443
Yeah.

193
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,544
Good to see you're still around,
Bruce.

194
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,014
What can I say? Deb makes a mean
sponge cake.

195
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,516
Good to see you, Bernie.
Alright.

196
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:26,851
- Good to see you too.
- Yes.

197
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,752
Come on,
let's go and get some grub.

198
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,354
Are you guys coming?

199
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,455
Oh, yeah.

200
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,091
He's a great guy but you
don't want to piss him off.

201
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,827
- He can be a mean bastard.
- Got that from the handshake.

202
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,031
Yeah. Welcome to the family.

203
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:31,346
You'd better not be shagging
the old labrador at Patto's.

204
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:52,031
Whisky!

205
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,509
Whisky!

206
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:14,953
Whisky!

207
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:24,961
Whisky!

208
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:35,505
Whisky!
Come here, boy!

209
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:39,172
Where you at, boy?

210
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:41,573
Whisky!

211
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:54,886
WHISKY!

212
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:08,534
Come on, boy.
Come here, boy!

213
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:19,043
Whisky, come here, boy.

214
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:48,803
Leave him alone, you bastard!
Leave him alone!

215
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:51,873
Whisky, come here, boy!

216
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,677
Come here!

217
00:21:57,255 --> 00:21:59,559
Ken, mate,
are you there?

218
00:22:05,196 --> 00:22:09,230
Barely. It's as hot as a tomcat
with four balls out here.

219
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:10,868
What do you want?

220
00:22:12,135 --> 00:22:14,702
Oh, look, mate,
I'm going a bit soft.

221
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:17,304
I thought I'd come out and give
you a hand, if you like.

222
00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:19,741
Ah, you just want my body.

223
00:22:19,743 --> 00:22:24,845
Well, grab your swag and some
ice and a few beers, eh?

224
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:26,081
OK.

225
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:30,383
I'll stop at the pub and I'll
put them on your account, huh?

226
00:22:30,385 --> 00:22:32,652
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

227
00:22:32,654 --> 00:22:35,088
Hey, tell Sasha I won't be back
till late morning,

228
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,123
something like that, alright?

229
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,825
Not a problem, bud.
See you soon, matey.

230
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:42,227
Yeah, I can hardly wait.

231
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:44,999
- Asshole.
- Roger that.

232
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:03,884
Fuck was that?

233
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,759
There you go.

234
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:27,069
- Oh, yes, you have.
- No, no.

235
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:29,003
- There you go, darling.
- Good on you.

236
00:23:29,005 --> 00:23:30,037
What time do you call this?

237
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,172
- What did I tell you?
- What?

238
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:33,174
No, I've got no tab.
I thought you had the tab.

239
00:23:33,176 --> 00:23:34,110
I thought you had the tab.

240
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,411
Nah, nah, nah. Nah.
I'm not paying for it.

241
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:39,349
I'm not paying for it either.

242
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,750
Hey, Sash, when's that
spunky father of yours

243
00:23:43,752 --> 00:23:44,786
gonna ask me out on a date?

244
00:23:44,788 --> 00:23:47,822
You ask me that same
bloody question every week

245
00:23:47,824 --> 00:23:48,823
and I give you the same answer.

246
00:23:48,825 --> 00:23:52,726
You're way too much
for my old man to handle.

247
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:55,094
She's right. He wouldn't last
five minutes with you.

248
00:23:55,096 --> 00:23:57,296
That's way too much information.

249
00:23:57,298 --> 00:23:58,965
Yeah, you're right.

250
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:02,102
I need a virile man
who can handle a cougar like me.

251
00:24:02,104 --> 00:24:04,269
Kind of makes me wish
I wasn't camping out tonight.

252
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:06,405
- G'day, Bluey.
- G'day, how are you going?

253
00:24:06,407 --> 00:24:08,873
Whoa, Blue, don't encourage her.

254
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,944
Let me guess. Dad sent you in
here for beer and food, right?

255
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:15,313
Well, he didn't say food,
but now that you mention it.

256
00:24:15,315 --> 00:24:17,482
Mm-hm. Well, you know where
the cold room is.

257
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:19,283
I'm not your bloody slave.
Off you go.

258
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:20,784
Alright, alright. God.

259
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:22,386
And whose account
am I putting this on?

260
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:26,123
- Do you really have to ask?
- Put it on Dad's tab, right?

261
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,158
Rack one up for me
on there too, eh?

262
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,994
- You can bloody pay for yours.
- Well, you can put it on ours.

263
00:24:30,996 --> 00:24:33,032
No, you two can bloody shut up.

264
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:37,767
Don't let Dad get too pissed

265
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,436
and make sure he eats
something this time.

266
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:42,237
- Is that enough food?
- We'll eat every last crust.

267
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:43,872
Here, you'd better take these
too.

268
00:24:43,874 --> 00:24:45,374
Dad likes a treat after dinner.

269
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:48,377
I could give him
an after-dinner treat.

270
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:51,147
You're such a bloody tart!

271
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:53,213
Well, on that note,
I'm out of here

272
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:55,415
but I'll catch you tomorrow.

273
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:57,184
Be safe.

274
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:58,552
Don't get too pissed.

275
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:01,055
Ah, we will and we will.

276
00:25:01,057 --> 00:25:04,192
Yeah, I know you bloody will,
you pair of old drunks.

277
00:25:04,194 --> 00:25:07,193
I swear the worst thing I did
was buy a pub.

278
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:09,029
See ya.

279
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:40,958
Do you think this is
a good idea?

280
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,066
Mm-hm. Best idea I've had,
like, ever, maybe.

281
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,067
I don't want Matt and Sheri
to hear us.

282
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:52,835
Then be quiet.

283
00:25:55,906 --> 00:25:57,442
Mmm.

284
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:03,880
- Oh, I tell you what.
- Mm?

285
00:26:03,882 --> 00:26:05,246
You go and get me a drink

286
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:09,117
and make sure that Matt
and Sheri are not outside

287
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:11,386
and I might let you have
a quickie.

288
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:15,056
Promise?

289
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:16,991
After all, we don't want
your balls exploding.

290
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:19,096
- Could get really messy.
- Yes.

291
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:26,466
Ah! I'm alright.

292
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:28,304
So graceful!

293
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,443
Oh. Oh, bugger.
I was bloody enjoying that.

294
00:26:36,445 --> 00:26:38,144
Jesus Christ.

295
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:40,879
It's just dropping everywhere.

296
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:44,820
Sasha's a good cook, eh?
She's just like her mother.

297
00:26:47,254 --> 00:26:50,489
She's JUST like her mother.

298
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:55,126
Yeah. She was amazing,
wasn't she, Maryanne?

299
00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:56,426
Mm.

300
00:26:56,428 --> 00:26:57,928
How long since she's gone, mate?

301
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,231
15 years.

302
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:04,436
15 long years since I buried
my fucking heart.

303
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:09,876
What's that?

304
00:27:17,212 --> 00:27:18,015
What do you see?

305
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,116
Is that a spot fire?

306
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:25,590
A camp fire, I think.
I can just make out a few tents.

307
00:27:28,424 --> 00:27:29,623
Oh!

308
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,960
Jesus, how much of that bloody
carton did you drink, mate?

309
00:27:32,962 --> 00:27:34,562
A lot more than you, mate.

310
00:27:34,564 --> 00:27:36,498
You've been drinking
like a fucking woman.

311
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,033
That Wendy and Anna

312
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:40,235
could drink you under the table
tonight, I reckon.

313
00:27:40,237 --> 00:27:41,537
Ah, bullshit.

314
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,305
What the bloody hell

315
00:27:45,307 --> 00:27:47,674
do you think they're doing
camping out here?

316
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:49,442
I don't reckon they got
permission.

317
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:51,445
What do you reckon
they're up to then?

318
00:27:51,447 --> 00:27:55,348
Oh, what do you reckon
we go and find out, eh?

319
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,921
Oh, bullshit, mate, I mean it's
nice and warm and cosy here.

320
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,854
Jesus Christ.

321
00:28:01,856 --> 00:28:05,957
Oh, mate, mate. OK, we'll take
the truck, we'll drive.

322
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:08,994
- I'm too drunk to drive, mate.
- Yeah, bullshit.

323
00:28:08,996 --> 00:28:10,262
You're too drunk to drive,

324
00:28:10,264 --> 00:28:12,296
you're not too drunk to sling a
bloody rifle over your shoulder.

325
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:13,532
Oh, for fuck's sake.

326
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:15,633
Oh, you fucking prick,
wait a minute,

327
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:17,467
I'll get some bloody piss
to take with us.

328
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:20,004
You carry on like an old fucking
woman, you do.

329
00:28:20,006 --> 00:28:22,206
Hang about, mate,
where's the bloody sandwiches?

330
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:24,407
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- What about a torch, mate?

331
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:25,676
Hurry up, princess.

332
00:28:25,678 --> 00:28:27,712
You'll end up bringing the whole
camp, the way you're going on.

333
00:28:27,714 --> 00:28:30,245
Mate, it'll take us
a bloody hour to walk.

334
00:28:30,247 --> 00:28:31,982
We're just going
for a little walk.

335
00:28:31,984 --> 00:28:34,283
It's not going to kill you.
Come on.

336
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:36,187
For Christ's sake!

337
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:39,591
Girl Guide.

338
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:10,252
Ryan, is that you?

339
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:32,136
Ryan, don't be an ass.
It isn't funny.

340
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:35,539
Oh, you're such an asshole.

341
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:40,377
Screw cutting you off
for tonight,

342
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,813
I'm cutting you off
for the entire month!

343
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:49,422
Oh, Ryan, where are you?

344
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:54,090
Please tell me it's you
out there.

345
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:57,526
Please.

346
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,132
Ryan?

347
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:22,183
Ryan?

348
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

349
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,421
Is it just me
or does that campfire

350
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:06,556
seem to be getting
further and further away?

351
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:09,692
We're past halfway, old mate.
Stop your bellyaching.

352
00:31:09,694 --> 00:31:11,694
I'm not as young
as I used to be, mate.

353
00:31:11,696 --> 00:31:15,765
The furthest I walk these days
is from the bar to the shitter.

354
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:17,732
Which reminds me,
I was in the pub today

355
00:31:17,734 --> 00:31:19,401
and I saw Anna and Wendy.

356
00:31:19,403 --> 00:31:21,170
They wanted to come out camping
with us.

357
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:22,470
Oh, Christ.

358
00:31:22,472 --> 00:31:24,273
Young Sasha put a stop to it,
though.

359
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:25,807
Well, thank fuck for that

360
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:26,875
because I wouldn't touch
either of them

361
00:31:26,877 --> 00:31:29,343
if they were the last living
pussy on the planet.

362
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,411
You'd end up with a crutch
full of herpes

363
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:32,613
or fucking dick rot.

364
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:33,448
Come on, let's get going.

365
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,618
What, you reckon
they've got a dose?

366
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,320
I'd bet my left lung on it,
mate.

367
00:31:39,322 --> 00:31:42,355
Shit! Hope you're bloody joking,
matey.

368
00:31:42,357 --> 00:31:43,823
I'm not joking.

369
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:45,359
Ah, Christ.

370
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,393
Come on, poxy balls, hurry up.

371
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,631
Hey, hey, did you hear that?

372
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,534
That was a scream, wasn't it?

373
00:31:54,536 --> 00:31:57,402
Yeah, definitely a scream, mate.

374
00:31:57,404 --> 00:31:59,371
What do you see?
What do you see, mate?

375
00:31:59,373 --> 00:32:03,176
What the fuck is that?

376
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:06,911
Either I'm pissed off my chest,
mate,

377
00:32:06,913 --> 00:32:09,414
or that's the biggest
fucking boar I've ever seen.

378
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:12,120
Here, you're a better shot
than me. You take a look.

379
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:21,958
Holy Mary, Mother of God!
That is a monster!

380
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,526
Well, shoot the fucking thing!

381
00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:30,800
- Please tell me you got it.
- No, mate.

382
00:32:30,802 --> 00:32:33,703
- No, it's... it's... it's gone.
- Oh, shit.

383
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:36,673
Mate, we've got to get back to
the bloody truck and get help.

384
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:39,208
No, mate, we're much closer to
them than we are to the truck.

385
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,443
We've got to find them and
we'll take one of their cars.

386
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:43,478
Mate, whoever was down there
before

387
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,579
is not there any bloody more!

388
00:32:44,581 --> 00:32:46,615
Mate, we have got to try,
you know,

389
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:49,553
we've got to go and fucking
find out, for Christ's sake!

390
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:05,434
Oh, Jesus.

391
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:08,867
Jesus Christ!

392
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:10,870
Ohhhhh.

393
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:12,872
Jesus Christ.

394
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:14,740
Ken, look, mate, look.

395
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:18,811
Oh, mate, I'm not fucking blind.
I can see, alright?

396
00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:21,747
What the fuck is happening here?

397
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,586
Oh, Jesus, look at that.

398
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,686
She's...

399
00:33:28,688 --> 00:33:30,688
Blue, she's...

400
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:33,460
They're... they're
just kids, mate.

401
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:42,498
Ahh... there's more of them.

402
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,435
- How do you know?
- There's two tents, right?

403
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:49,672
I mean, they're not going to
come out here and go camping

404
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:53,743
and sleep in separate tents,
are they, you know?

405
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:58,449
So, ah, well, judging by this,
um...

406
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:04,519
..this, ah, this girl, mate,
um...

407
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:08,722
..I-I reckon that they would've
been sleeping in that tent

408
00:34:08,724 --> 00:34:13,361
and the other kids must've
took off

409
00:34:13,363 --> 00:34:15,666
when that bloody big pig
attacked.

410
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:19,401
Now, give me that, give me that.
Here.

411
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:27,840
Oh, Christ.
We don't have any bullets, mate.

412
00:34:27,842 --> 00:34:29,676
- What?
- I haven't loaded the mag.

413
00:34:29,678 --> 00:34:32,077
Oh, shit. Why didn't you bloody
check it, you stupid bastard?

414
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,713
- Well, because...
- No fucking bullets!

415
00:34:33,715 --> 00:34:37,082
How was I to know we were
going to find a fucking pig

416
00:34:37,084 --> 00:34:39,752
the size of a fucking rhino?

417
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:41,552
Jesus Christ.

418
00:34:41,554 --> 00:34:45,056
Blue, you're going to have to go
back to the truck, mate.

419
00:34:45,058 --> 00:34:47,692
I-I got bullets in the glovebox

420
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:49,960
and-and I'll stay here and see
if I can find these kids.

421
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,697
No, no. Fuck that, mate.

422
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:52,763
I'm not leaving you on your own

423
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:57,067
and I'm not walking back there
by myself either.

424
00:34:57,069 --> 00:34:59,970
Blue, I got no bullets.

425
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:04,974
We are sitting ducks if that
monster fucking comes back here.

426
00:35:04,976 --> 00:35:08,043
You've gotta go back
to the truck, you know.

427
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:13,048
I am not leaving those kids
out in the bush by themselves.

428
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,885
You know, they'll be scared
fucking shitless.

429
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:18,553
So you've got to get going.

430
00:35:18,555 --> 00:35:20,055
Well, what are you waiting for?

431
00:35:20,057 --> 00:35:24,026
Blue, look, you can do this.
You'll be back in half the time.

432
00:35:24,028 --> 00:35:26,995
When was the last time
you went for a jog?

433
00:35:26,997 --> 00:35:30,430
Alright, I'll go back
to the bloody truck, mate.

434
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,066
But you look around, see if
there's a bloody car here,

435
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:35,001
get in the bastard
and pick me up

436
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:38,405
because, mate, we're both
dead men without a bloody rifle.

437
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:40,973
So it's weapons first, then we
look for the bloody kids, right?

438
00:35:40,975 --> 00:35:44,877
Righto, mate, I'll-I'll do my
best, I'll look around, OK,

439
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:47,047
but you just get going, OK?

440
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:50,116
- Take the bloody torch.
- No, you-you...

441
00:35:50,118 --> 00:35:52,084
No, I don't need
the fucking torch, you know.

442
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:53,852
I can build the fire up.
You take it.

443
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:58,691
- Go on, go on, get going.
- I'm gone, bloody piss off.

444
00:35:58,693 --> 00:36:00,725
- Oh, Blue. Blue!
- What?

445
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,160
Mate, go as fast as you can

446
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:04,496
but find a big
motherfucking stick

447
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:07,565
and grab it just in case,
alright?

448
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,036
Got it!

449
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:15,576
Jesus H. Christ.

450
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,891
Oh, oh, Jesus.

451
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:37,460
What's that?

452
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:41,666
Hey! Are you the kids
from the camp back there?

453
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:51,071
You fucking dingoes!

454
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:53,376
Oh, Jesus! Fuck!

455
00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:56,143
Oh, Jesus.

456
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:58,545
Oh, shit!

457
00:36:58,547 --> 00:36:59,646
What the...?

458
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,217
Ohh.

459
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:06,453
Holy Jesus Christ.

460
00:37:06,455 --> 00:37:09,989
Oh, Jesus.

461
00:37:15,196 --> 00:37:17,431
I know you're out there.

462
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:20,634
I know you're out there!

463
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:26,938
I know you're there.

464
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:33,009
Oh, Jesus.

465
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:35,011
Come and get me!

466
00:37:35,013 --> 00:37:38,885
Oh, you feral fuck.

467
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,952
Oh, Jesus!

468
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,090
Oh, oh!

469
00:37:56,033 --> 00:38:00,005
You asshole, where are you?

470
00:38:22,558 --> 00:38:24,092
Come on!

471
00:38:34,635 --> 00:38:37,638
Come on. Come on.

472
00:38:41,574 --> 00:38:42,809
Come on!

473
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:52,586
Come and get me.

474
00:38:54,687 --> 00:38:57,988
Come and get me, you bastard.

475
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:49,671
Where's your bloody car?

476
00:40:13,692 --> 00:40:15,295
Matthew.

477
00:40:18,963 --> 00:40:20,899
Where are you, Matthew?

478
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:32,074
I hope you know
how to get back to camp.

479
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:34,409
Yeah, it's just up here a bit.

480
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:38,913
Don't panic, it's probably just
Ryan and Hanna mucking around.

481
00:40:38,915 --> 00:40:41,415
That is something Ryan would do.

482
00:40:41,417 --> 00:40:44,051
I want to tell you about this
Yara-ma-yha-who.

483
00:40:44,053 --> 00:40:45,856
Come sit down here for a bit.

484
00:40:49,258 --> 00:40:51,858
So, the Yara-ma-yha-who, right,

485
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,795
he's like a little red man,
alright,

486
00:40:54,797 --> 00:40:57,030
and he kind of looks a bit like
a demon, yeah?

487
00:40:57,032 --> 00:40:59,999
And he doesn't have any teeth,
which is weird for a vampire.

488
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:03,403
And his skin's all glossy,
like... like silk.

489
00:41:03,405 --> 00:41:05,971
Anyway, he climbs up high
into the trees

490
00:41:05,973 --> 00:41:07,839
to stalk his victims.

491
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:10,710
You know, he moves like a monkey
in the trees, ooh, ooh, ooh.

492
00:41:10,712 --> 00:41:12,310
But he doesn't make a sound.

493
00:41:12,312 --> 00:41:15,214
He watches them closely,
sizing them up.

494
00:41:15,216 --> 00:41:17,948
And then he stalks them
and stands right above them,

495
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,851
right above his next meal.

496
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,988
Then, when he's ready,

497
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,157
he jumps,

498
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:27,924
wrapping these octopus-like
tentacles around his victims,

499
00:41:27,926 --> 00:41:29,960
sucking all the blood
out of them.

500
00:41:29,962 --> 00:41:32,462
Now he can dislocate his jaw,
too, like a snake,

501
00:41:32,464 --> 00:41:35,199
so he can swallow his victims
whole.

502
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:38,034
Then, when he's finished
his meal, he rests,

503
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:40,870
lets it all settles down
in his stomach.

504
00:41:40,872 --> 00:41:42,905
And then when he wakes up,

505
00:41:42,907 --> 00:41:44,974
he immediately regurgitates
everything back up

506
00:41:44,976 --> 00:41:46,209
onto the floor

507
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:48,912
and there in a pile
of muck and goo

508
00:41:48,914 --> 00:41:52,083
is a baby newborn
Yara-ma-yha-who.

509
00:41:53,717 --> 00:41:56,217
Firstly, that is disgusting.

510
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:59,955
Did you hear that?

511
00:41:59,957 --> 00:42:03,790
I'm not going to sleep or eat
for a week now.

512
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:06,095
- Secondly...
- Seriously, shh for a second.

513
00:42:09,466 --> 00:42:12,033
I heard something.
Hand me the torch.

514
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:14,868
I'm not handing you the torch.

515
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:21,808
I think there's a wild pig
out here.

516
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,175
Of course there is.

517
00:42:23,177 --> 00:42:25,811
There was drop bears,
drop possums

518
00:42:25,813 --> 00:42:27,779
and some ridiculous
outback vampire

519
00:42:27,781 --> 00:42:29,814
and now wild pigs
are stalking us!

520
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:31,887
I'm serious.
Give me the bloody torch!

521
00:42:45,532 --> 00:42:47,965
Your story doesn't make sense.

522
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:49,134
What do you mean?

523
00:42:49,136 --> 00:42:51,768
Your drop vampire yeti story,
it doesn't make any sense.

524
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:56,973
It's not my story.
It's an Aboriginal legend.

525
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,013
Ryan. Is that you?

526
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:06,249
Sheridan, we have to be quiet
for a sec.

527
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,987
- Why?
- Just sh-sh-sh.

528
00:43:17,326 --> 00:43:20,161
Well, I was always told that
drop bears hang from the trees

529
00:43:20,163 --> 00:43:22,029
and when their claws come down,

530
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:24,098
they hook into your head
and reef you off the ground.

531
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,833
I am serious! Shut the fuck up!

532
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:30,403
Calm down, babe.
That was really rude.

533
00:43:30,405 --> 00:43:35,045
I'm sorry. I just need you to be
quiet for a sec, OK?

534
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:44,417
I'm going to turn the light out.

535
00:43:44,419 --> 00:43:46,121
What?

536
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fuck me!

537
00:44:03,003 --> 00:44:04,538
Sheri!

538
00:44:07,574 --> 00:44:10,344
SHERI!

539
00:44:14,614 --> 00:44:16,613
Help me!

540
00:44:16,615 --> 00:44:19,484
Somebody help!

541
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:23,522
Let her go!

542
00:44:39,602 --> 00:44:40,937
What the fuck?!

543
00:44:45,274 --> 00:44:46,577
What the fuck?

544
00:45:31,549 --> 00:45:34,254
Oh, shit!

545
00:45:37,323 --> 00:45:41,256
Hey, honey,
you breathing over there?

546
00:45:41,258 --> 00:45:44,262
Come on, one of you be OK.

547
00:45:54,672 --> 00:45:57,572
Oh, Jesus.

548
00:45:57,574 --> 00:46:00,041
Oh, Jesus, Jesus.

549
00:46:00,043 --> 00:46:04,611
Ah. So sorry, sweetheart.

550
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:10,350
Oh, shhhhh, it's all right,
it's all right, it's all right.

551
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:13,620
- You don't have to talk.
- It's not a drop bear.

552
00:46:13,622 --> 00:46:16,489
No, yeah, I know.

553
00:46:16,491 --> 00:46:19,192
What's-what's your name?

554
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:22,128
Sh... Sheridan.

555
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:26,502
Yeah? My name's Ken, hey?

556
00:46:28,502 --> 00:46:33,305
Now, just try and relax.

557
00:46:33,307 --> 00:46:37,241
You're in shock, sweetheart,
hey?

558
00:46:37,243 --> 00:46:40,043
Now, I just need you
to stay calm

559
00:46:40,045 --> 00:46:42,746
to help me, alright. Hey?

560
00:46:42,748 --> 00:46:44,983
OK?

561
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:48,152
Is Matt OK?

562
00:46:48,154 --> 00:46:51,388
No, no, not really, he's not.

563
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,660
It's you that we've got to worry
about now, though, eh?

564
00:47:07,137 --> 00:47:14,010
Sheridan, Sheridan,
you've got to be still, OK,

565
00:47:14,012 --> 00:47:16,447
and very, very quiet.

566
00:47:20,116 --> 00:47:25,185
I need you to be as quiet
as possible, OK?

567
00:47:25,187 --> 00:47:28,488
I know it hurts.
I know it hurts.

568
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,526
But...

569
00:47:33,528 --> 00:47:35,465
..I need you to be...

570
00:47:36,631 --> 00:47:38,032
..nice and still.

571
00:47:38,034 --> 00:47:40,199
And I'll lead him
away from here.

572
00:47:40,201 --> 00:47:44,737
- No! No!
- No, no, it's-it's... it's OK.

573
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:48,674
It's OK. I've been doing this
since I was a kid.

574
00:47:48,676 --> 00:47:50,176
Yeah?

575
00:47:50,178 --> 00:47:52,713
I've been doing this
since I was a little kid.

576
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,293
Hey!

577
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,774
Come on, come on, you mongrel!

578
00:48:25,776 --> 00:48:29,279
You're the pig, I'm the big bad
fucking wolf!

579
00:48:31,482 --> 00:48:33,784
That's right, ugly guts,
come on, follow me!

580
00:48:40,656 --> 00:48:42,258
Jesus!

581
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:11,449
Sheridan, Sheridan,
you've got to stand up.

582
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:13,585
You've got to stand, OK?

583
00:49:13,587 --> 00:49:15,289
I've got to get you out.

584
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:18,825
Ohhhh.

585
00:49:22,561 --> 00:49:24,431
Oh, Jesus.

586
00:49:26,766 --> 00:49:34,574
Oh. I'm so sorry, little one.
I'm sor... I'm so sorry.

587
00:49:52,788 --> 00:49:55,225
I'm coming, Maryanne.

588
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,797
Come on, you piece of shit!

589
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:06,535
Sashaaaa!

590
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:23,550
Mum, I don't think I could eat
another bite.

591
00:50:23,552 --> 00:50:24,751
I'm ready to explode.

592
00:50:24,753 --> 00:50:26,318
You're going to explode,
are you?

593
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,486
It's not for you, honey,
it's for Uncle Bernie.

594
00:50:28,488 --> 00:50:30,254
He's already had three servings!

595
00:50:30,256 --> 00:50:31,556
Elli, I'm a growing boy.

596
00:50:31,558 --> 00:50:32,658
Yeah, 'boy's about right,

597
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,294
the way you chased Bart
to the bathroom this morning.

598
00:50:36,296 --> 00:50:38,263
So, what's the plan for today,
Bernie?

599
00:50:38,265 --> 00:50:41,599
I've been thinking we can take
a drive out to Patto's farm,

600
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:44,302
we can take a picnic lunch,
have a swim in the river,

601
00:50:44,304 --> 00:50:46,671
when the sun starts to go down
we can do a bit of spotting.

602
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:49,507
- Yeah, let's go swimming.
- You want to go swimming?

603
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:52,442
Hey, Uncle Bernie, do you reckon
we could take some guns out?

604
00:50:52,444 --> 00:50:53,977
- Maybe just...
- Deb.

605
00:50:53,979 --> 00:50:56,612
Bart wants to know
if we can take some guns.

606
00:50:56,614 --> 00:51:00,716
Bernie, you know how I feel
about guns.

607
00:51:00,718 --> 00:51:04,385
I would think that out there
at least one for safety.

608
00:51:04,387 --> 00:51:06,655
Not a bad idea, Bruce.

609
00:51:06,657 --> 00:51:08,490
What do you say?
Just for safety, Debs?

610
00:51:08,492 --> 00:51:10,593
You guys are full of it.

611
00:51:10,595 --> 00:51:13,796
You just want to sneak about
in the bush like commandos

612
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:14,896
and shoot shit.

613
00:51:14,898 --> 00:51:16,130
Well, I've seen Charlie's Farm.

614
00:51:16,132 --> 00:51:19,601
I know there's creeps out there
ready to cut you up, rape you.

615
00:51:19,603 --> 00:51:21,469
- Robbie!
- I can tell you right now,

616
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,705
all those hillbillies out there
will shoot you

617
00:51:23,707 --> 00:51:25,406
before you step foot
on their property.

618
00:51:25,408 --> 00:51:29,008
Well, I reckon I can shoot a can
at 50 meters.

619
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:31,812
- Probably 25. I don't know.
- Is that right?

620
00:51:31,814 --> 00:51:34,715
And at the fair last year,
with the ducks,

621
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:37,517
you didn't shoot a single one
and they were two meters away?

622
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:39,552
Yeah, well, that game
was rigged.

623
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,020
Yet Bart hit three of them.

624
00:51:41,022 --> 00:51:42,154
Three of them.

625
00:51:42,156 --> 00:51:45,891
But the way you kept trying
to win me that teddy bear,

626
00:51:45,893 --> 00:51:47,393
that was sweet.

627
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,594
I wasn't trying to win you shit,

628
00:51:48,596 --> 00:51:50,429
I was trying to prove a point,
that the game was rigged.

629
00:51:50,431 --> 00:51:51,662
Whatever.

630
00:51:51,664 --> 00:51:53,832
And if I remember correctly,

631
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:55,767
you were the winner
at the end of the night.

632
00:51:55,769 --> 00:51:57,901
That's right.
I was the winner, wasn't I?

633
00:51:57,903 --> 00:51:59,638
Are you right?

634
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,973
So, how are we all going to get
out there, Bernie?

635
00:52:01,975 --> 00:52:04,842
- The troopy, my friend.
- And what's a troopy?

636
00:52:04,844 --> 00:52:06,509
Aw, what's a troopy!

637
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:08,579
Why the bloody hell did you
have to go and marry a Yank?

638
00:52:08,581 --> 00:52:11,014
Bruce, it's the car we took
to the pub last night.

639
00:52:11,016 --> 00:52:13,449
- I knew that!
- Yes, I know you did.

640
00:52:13,451 --> 00:52:15,017
Thank you, sweetie.

641
00:52:15,019 --> 00:52:16,685
What a knob.

642
00:52:16,687 --> 00:52:19,421
I'm going to go
and put my swimmers on.

643
00:52:19,423 --> 00:52:22,859
I'm going to join you. You guys
want to load up the car?

644
00:52:22,861 --> 00:52:25,727
Ah, Mum, about the gun...

645
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:28,963
Alright, one gun.
Bernie, I mean it, just one.

646
00:52:28,965 --> 00:52:31,301
Fine, fine, one gun.
Got it.

647
00:52:33,503 --> 00:52:35,470
- Oh, fuck!
- Bernie!

648
00:52:35,472 --> 00:52:36,637
Did I scare you, Bruiser?

649
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:39,973
You need to relax, city boy.
Too much pent-up tension.

650
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:42,475
Come on, Robbie.

651
00:52:42,477 --> 00:52:44,344
Let's go and fill up
the cruiser.

652
00:52:44,346 --> 00:52:48,651
- It's Robert.
- Nah, I like Robbie better.

653
00:52:51,086 --> 00:52:55,258
Hey. Let him call you Robbie.
It's easier that way.

654
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,393
Come on, Bruiser.

655
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:02,061
Fill up the troopy.

656
00:53:02,063 --> 00:53:04,996
The troopy!

657
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,853
Yeah, you like that, don't ya?

658
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:33,757
Seem like the kind of girl
who loves a good spanking.

659
00:53:33,759 --> 00:53:37,360
Why don't you bend over and let
me stick my foot up your ass

660
00:53:37,362 --> 00:53:38,694
and see how much you like that?

661
00:53:38,696 --> 00:53:41,863
- Sounds kinky. I like it kinky.
- Damo!

662
00:53:41,865 --> 00:53:44,066
Control your fucking mutt!

663
00:53:44,068 --> 00:53:46,068
He's got a point.
You're being a fucking idiot.

664
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:46,935
I get it.

665
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:48,903
Let me make myself
very fucking clear

666
00:53:48,905 --> 00:53:51,739
because I've just about had
enough of your fucking shit.

667
00:53:51,741 --> 00:53:53,507
If you fucking touch me again

668
00:53:53,509 --> 00:53:56,076
I'll rip off your arm and I'll
beat you to death with it.

669
00:53:56,078 --> 00:53:58,880
How about I give you a free pass
for my indiscretion?

670
00:53:58,882 --> 00:54:01,882
I'll let you hit me.
I won't try and stop you.

671
00:54:01,884 --> 00:54:04,651
Come on, babe. Just let go
of some of that tension.

672
00:54:04,653 --> 00:54:07,020
You stupid fuck!

673
00:54:07,022 --> 00:54:08,689
Get the fuck out of my bar!

674
00:54:08,691 --> 00:54:12,729
Go on! You're leaking
all over my floor, you asshole!

675
00:54:14,162 --> 00:54:19,432
Fucking slut!
Who do you think you are?

676
00:54:19,434 --> 00:54:22,934
You show her some fucking
respect, you little shit.

677
00:54:22,936 --> 00:54:25,604
Get that sack of shit
out of here, Bernie.

678
00:54:25,606 --> 00:54:27,672
He's stinking up my bar.

679
00:54:27,674 --> 00:54:29,174
Yahoo!

680
00:54:38,051 --> 00:54:39,450
What's he doing?

681
00:54:39,452 --> 00:54:41,418
I think
he knocked him out.

682
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:44,421
- Did you see that? Holy shit!
- Ouch!

683
00:54:44,423 --> 00:54:48,459
And that, Robert, is why
you let him call you Robbie.

684
00:54:48,461 --> 00:54:49,896
Got it.

685
00:54:54,565 --> 00:54:56,098
You alright, Sash?

686
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,536
- Yeah. What a dickhead.
- Yeah.

687
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,471
Hey, I had it under control,
you know.

688
00:55:02,473 --> 00:55:04,807
I know you did. I was just
finishing it for you.

689
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:06,642
Ah, what a shot, big fella!

690
00:55:06,644 --> 00:55:07,843
You shut up.

691
00:55:07,845 --> 00:55:10,077
Thanks, love.
What can I get you?

692
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,146
I'm taking the family out
to Patto's for a swim.

693
00:55:12,148 --> 00:55:14,048
I just might clean out
your fridge.

694
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:16,516
No worries.

695
00:55:16,518 --> 00:55:18,085
What are you after?

696
00:55:18,087 --> 00:55:19,753
Some of those doughnuts please,
Sash.

697
00:55:19,755 --> 00:55:22,123
- And some chockies for Bart.
- Yeah, yeah. Of course, love.

698
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:23,523
How about drinks?

699
00:55:23,525 --> 00:55:26,796
Yep. Just soft drinks.
That'd be wonderful.

700
00:55:29,832 --> 00:55:32,731
- Can I get some ice too, there?
- Yeah, love, no worries.

701
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:33,966
Thank you.

702
00:55:33,968 --> 00:55:36,169
Just give me $20, love,
that's fine.

703
00:55:36,171 --> 00:55:38,504
Hey, if you see Dad out there,

704
00:55:38,506 --> 00:55:39,771
can you get him to give me
a call?

705
00:55:39,773 --> 00:55:41,907
He was out there with Blue
last night

706
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:43,641
and he was supposed to be back
this morning

707
00:55:43,643 --> 00:55:44,976
but I haven't heard from them.

708
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:46,512
Sure. Was he working at Patto's
yesterday?

709
00:55:46,514 --> 00:55:48,813
Yeah. I tried calling
his mobile phone

710
00:55:48,815 --> 00:55:50,516
but I just got his
answering machine

711
00:55:50,518 --> 00:55:52,616
but maybe they've got
no reception.

712
00:55:52,618 --> 00:55:54,519
No worries, then.

713
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:56,220
If I see a pair of old drunks,
I'll send them home

714
00:55:56,222 --> 00:55:57,821
with their tails
between their legs.

715
00:55:57,823 --> 00:55:58,790
Thanks, darling.

716
00:55:58,792 --> 00:55:59,591
- See you later, big fella.
- See you, mate.

717
00:55:59,593 --> 00:56:01,896
- See you, Bernie.
- See you, mate.

718
00:56:12,505 --> 00:56:14,140
Come on, tackle!

719
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:30,985
Hey, Bernie, be careful, dammit.

720
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,588
He's not going to hurt Bart.
He's too protective of him.

721
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,758
Yeah, I know but he doesn't know
his own strength.

722
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,758
If he's not careful,

723
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,826
Bart's going to end up
in one of those trees.

724
00:56:46,234 --> 00:56:50,073
- Bernie, I mean it!
- Relax, sis.

725
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:53,708
Your mother's gone soft.

726
00:57:09,189 --> 00:57:12,025
- Oh, hey!
- Yeah, that's mature.

727
00:57:13,893 --> 00:57:16,929
Oh. I'll be taking off
for about half an hour.

728
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:20,196
What for?

729
00:57:20,198 --> 00:57:22,934
Sasha said Ken and Blue
are out there somewhere.

730
00:57:22,936 --> 00:57:25,035
She's a bit worried because
they didn't come home

731
00:57:25,037 --> 00:57:26,303
when they said they would.

732
00:57:26,305 --> 00:57:27,971
Well, how are you
going to find them?

733
00:57:27,973 --> 00:57:29,873
Isn't this property
over 2 million acres?

734
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,875
I was talking to Ken
the other day.

735
00:57:31,877 --> 00:57:34,311
He told me he was working down
the west fence.

736
00:57:34,313 --> 00:57:36,246
That's only a few klicks
that way

737
00:57:36,248 --> 00:57:39,781
so I'll take a quick run on the
fence line and check it out.

738
00:57:39,783 --> 00:57:41,616
Want to go with him?

739
00:57:41,618 --> 00:57:43,352
You want Bruce to go with you?

740
00:57:43,354 --> 00:57:45,754
Nah.

741
00:57:45,756 --> 00:57:48,957
Bruiser can stay here
and protect the family, mate.

742
00:57:48,959 --> 00:57:50,724
No worries, mate.

743
00:57:50,726 --> 00:57:54,031
I will stay here
and protect the family, Bern.

744
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:59,701
It's Bernie, mate. Not Bern.
Bernie.

745
00:57:59,703 --> 00:58:01,271
Rightio, then.

746
00:58:12,013 --> 00:58:14,780
- He scares me.
- Yep.

747
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:17,019
He scares everybody, that one.

I didn't hear anything.

768
01:00:00,979 --> 01:00:03,280
Are you deaf? Yeah, I heard it.

769
01:00:03,282 --> 01:00:05,382
It sounded like an explosion
or something.

770
01:00:05,384 --> 01:00:07,383
- Didn't you hear it?
- No.

771
01:00:07,385 --> 01:00:09,355
Yeah, yeah, it did.

772
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:15,991
I think I'm going to go
check it out.

773
01:00:15,993 --> 01:00:17,292
Why?

774
01:00:17,294 --> 01:00:18,761
I just want to.

775
01:00:18,763 --> 01:00:19,895
- Really?
- Yeah.

776
01:00:19,897 --> 01:00:22,864
Yeah, alright, well, take
one of the boys with you.

777
01:00:22,866 --> 01:00:24,232
- I don't want to go.
- I'm not going that far.

778
01:00:24,234 --> 01:00:26,770
It's just for safety, hon.
Take Robert.

779
01:00:30,106 --> 01:00:33,407
Go on, baby.
You can finally play soldier.

780
01:00:33,409 --> 01:00:35,510
Yeah, you'd love that,
wouldn't you, huh? Huh?

781
01:00:35,512 --> 01:00:37,211
Give me a kiss. Another one.

782
01:00:37,213 --> 01:00:40,246
- Hon, wait for Robert.
- Stop it.

783
01:00:43,451 --> 01:00:45,455
Look after my boy, Bruce.

784
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,026
Hon, forgot your binoculars!

785
01:01:24,023 --> 01:01:25,459
Fuck me!

786
01:02:18,572 --> 01:02:21,005
I'm going to ask Elli
to marry me.

787
01:02:21,007 --> 01:02:23,077
What?

788
01:02:24,612 --> 01:02:28,245
How long have you guys been
going out, like 7, 8 months?

789
01:02:28,247 --> 01:02:30,582
She's the one, Bruce.

790
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:35,286
When you know it, you know it.
Life's too short for what-ifs.

791
01:02:35,288 --> 01:02:37,321
Did you tell Debbie?

792
01:02:37,323 --> 01:02:40,858
No. Not yet.

793
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:45,028
I reckon she'll be pretty happy
though, don't you think?

794
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:48,234
Well, she likes you
so I should think so, yeah.

795
01:02:49,467 --> 01:02:50,900
I mean, my only piece of advice

796
01:02:50,902 --> 01:02:53,201
is make sure that's what
you guys want to do.

797
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:54,469
It is, mate.

798
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:55,438
A lot of times people jump in

799
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,873
when they're in that starry-eyed
phase and...

800
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:59,408
Yeah, well, we're adults, Bruce.

801
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:02,611
Well, you know, marriage is not
all fun and games.

802
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:05,013
You've got to be in it
for the long haul.

803
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:07,983
I am.

804
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:11,952
You know, I've been helping
to raise Elli for so long

805
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,555
I feel like her real father

806
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:17,994
and I just want you to know
that if you hurt her...

807
01:03:20,362 --> 01:03:22,630
..I will hurt you back.

808
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:26,036
I wouldn't have it
any other way, Bruce.

809
01:03:27,669 --> 01:03:30,102
You know, I don't want to get
all heavy here,

810
01:03:30,104 --> 01:03:32,004
I don't want to piss
in your pocket

811
01:03:32,006 --> 01:03:37,310
but, you know,
I don't know much about you,

812
01:03:37,312 --> 01:03:40,144
I don't know about your
childhood or your parents.

813
01:03:40,146 --> 01:03:42,014
What the hell does that have
to do with anything?

814
01:03:42,016 --> 01:03:43,481
Well, it has everything
to do with it

815
01:03:43,483 --> 01:03:45,150
because I want to make sure
that Elli is happy.

816
01:03:45,152 --> 01:03:47,518
My parents were real good,
Bruce.

817
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,323
They were real good.

818
01:03:50,923 --> 01:03:55,993
Well, that's good because
marriage is permanent.

819
01:03:55,995 --> 01:03:58,596
Remind me, Bruce,

820
01:03:58,598 --> 01:04:01,265
how many times
have you been married now?

821
01:04:01,267 --> 01:04:03,333
Three times.

822
01:04:03,335 --> 01:04:05,601
Yeah. Yeah, that's my point.

823
01:04:05,603 --> 01:04:08,304
I'm the poster child
for what not to do.

824
01:04:08,306 --> 01:04:09,274
Yeah.

825
01:04:13,512 --> 01:04:18,247
Look... I'm sorry
if I pissed you off.

826
01:04:18,249 --> 01:04:19,584
Don't worry about it.

827
01:04:24,187 --> 01:04:28,488
Let's check up around that band
and then we'll go back, alright?

828
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:29,959
Yeah.

829
01:04:37,367 --> 01:04:40,132
You right there, bub?
You look a bit out of sorts.

830
01:04:40,134 --> 01:04:42,569
Ah, look, it's probably nothing,
Ernie,

831
01:04:42,571 --> 01:04:45,339
but Dad and Blue camped out
last night

832
01:04:45,341 --> 01:04:47,306
and Dad said he'd be back
first thing in the morning

833
01:04:47,308 --> 01:04:49,275
and I haven't heard from him
all day.

834
01:04:49,277 --> 01:04:51,276
I can't even get him
on the bloody phone.

835
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:54,479
You tried Blue's mobile?
I got his number here somewhere.

836
01:04:54,481 --> 01:04:56,015
I tried them like 20, 30 times.

837
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:58,617
- The usual, love?
- Yes, please.

838
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:00,452
That's not like your dad.

839
01:05:00,454 --> 01:05:04,355
I mean, he's alright, though.
He'll be alright.

840
01:05:04,357 --> 01:05:08,560
There's nothing out there
except dust and roos.

841
01:05:08,562 --> 01:05:11,096
That's a load of shit, Ernie,
and you know it!

842
01:05:11,098 --> 01:05:13,431
There's something out there
that's been knocking down fences

843
01:05:13,433 --> 01:05:16,432
and killing the livestock
for months now.

844
01:05:16,434 --> 01:05:19,470
You mean that monster wild boar
you claim to have seen?

845
01:05:19,472 --> 01:05:21,205
Not claimed to have seen,
I saw it!

846
01:05:21,207 --> 01:05:24,240
- Ah, you were drunk.
- I know what I saw.

847
01:05:24,242 --> 01:05:25,776
What exactly did you see, Jack,

848
01:05:25,778 --> 01:05:27,610
'cause all I've heard is
second-hand rumours

849
01:05:27,612 --> 01:05:29,445
and they get more
bloody ridiculous

850
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:30,480
every time they're told.

851
01:05:30,482 --> 01:05:34,217
Well, you remember that smash
up on the highway

852
01:05:34,219 --> 01:05:36,219
coming into town, right,
about 12 months ago?

853
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:38,120
You remember they couldn't find
the couple?

854
01:05:38,122 --> 01:05:41,122
All the police found
was the wrecked car, right?

855
01:05:41,124 --> 01:05:42,223
Yeah.

856
01:05:42,225 --> 01:05:46,028
Well, I was coming back
from Bob's place in me truck

857
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:47,529
and I'm looking out the window

858
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:50,064
and I spot something
in this paddock

859
01:05:50,066 --> 01:05:51,798
about 300 or 400 metres out

860
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,202
so I gets the spotty on it...
fuck me drunk, it's a boar!

861
01:05:55,204 --> 01:05:56,436
It looks like a boar

862
01:05:56,438 --> 01:05:59,139
and it's about the size
of a fucking kombi van!

863
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:01,574
Yeah, so I follow it along
with a spotlight

864
01:06:01,576 --> 01:06:03,276
and I'm driving along
and I'm driving along

865
01:06:03,278 --> 01:06:05,145
and it starts getting closer,
right,

866
01:06:05,147 --> 01:06:06,478
and it's about 100 metres off.

867
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,415
And I can see that
this bastard's

868
01:06:08,417 --> 01:06:10,482
got a person hanging
in its mouth.

869
01:06:10,484 --> 01:06:12,484
Well, it's a female,
to be precise,

870
01:06:12,486 --> 01:06:14,352
and she's got long hair,
you know,

871
01:06:14,354 --> 01:06:17,289
and she's just hanging there
like a rag doll

872
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:18,490
and I shat meself

873
01:06:18,492 --> 01:06:21,392
and then I accidentally lost
control of the spotty handle.

874
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:24,095
Come on.
You're shitting me, right?

875
01:06:24,097 --> 01:06:28,266
Pigs don't grow that bloody big
and they don't eat people.

876
01:06:28,268 --> 01:06:29,400
I know what I saw.

877
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,435
I might have been drunk,

878
01:06:30,437 --> 01:06:32,536
yeah, I shouldn't have been
driving or something.

879
01:06:32,538 --> 01:06:34,705
Well, it could've been anything,
eh, eh?

880
01:06:34,707 --> 01:06:37,674
Maybe it was a cow eating grass,
eh?

881
01:06:37,676 --> 01:06:40,177
Well, whatever it was when I hit
the spotty back

882
01:06:40,179 --> 01:06:41,845
it was long gone.

883
01:06:41,847 --> 01:06:44,684
How do you know it wasn't
a hairy bloke, Jack?

884
01:06:46,684 --> 01:06:50,286
I saw her tits, they were
hanging out the top like that.

885
01:06:50,288 --> 01:06:51,820
Mate, if there was something
out there

886
01:06:51,822 --> 01:06:53,288
as big as what you say
it is,

887
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:55,657
knocking over fences
and terrorising livestock,

888
01:06:55,659 --> 01:06:58,694
it'll take more than a rifle
and a slug to slow it down.

889
01:06:58,696 --> 01:07:01,096
Yeah. Yeah.

890
01:07:01,098 --> 01:07:02,363
What, you believe him?

891
01:07:02,365 --> 01:07:04,731
Yeah, well, I've heard
stranger stories.

892
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:08,169
You believe that I saw a monster
pig with a kid in its mouth?

893
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:09,637
Hey?

894
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:12,774
When I said to... I spoke
to the cops

895
01:07:12,776 --> 01:07:14,608
they just laughed at me.

896
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:16,710
Yeah.
Well, you know how it is,

897
01:07:16,712 --> 01:07:18,744
everyone here thinks I've got
a few roos loose

898
01:07:18,746 --> 01:07:20,681
in the top paddock,
if you know what I mean.

899
01:07:20,683 --> 01:07:23,349
Mate, your drunken antics

900
01:07:23,351 --> 01:07:26,618
have gained you quite
a reputation around here.

901
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:27,886
Ain't that the truth?

902
01:07:27,888 --> 01:07:29,788
I still remember you doing
the nudie run

903
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,591
- up and down the street.
- Yeah!

904
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:34,493
That's something
I would like to un-see, Jack!

905
01:07:38,632 --> 01:07:42,199
Well, mate,
if there's anything out there

906
01:07:42,201 --> 01:07:43,601
as big as what you reckon

907
01:07:43,603 --> 01:07:46,637
I reckon a lot more people
would've seen it

908
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:47,606
than crazy old Jack.

909
01:07:47,608 --> 01:07:51,341
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
thanks, mate.

910
01:07:51,343 --> 01:07:52,609
See?

911
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:56,779
Well, you know, whatever it is,
even if it's not a monster pig,

912
01:07:56,781 --> 01:08:00,917
something is wiping out
the livestock

913
01:08:00,919 --> 01:08:03,188
and smashing the fences.

914
01:08:05,423 --> 01:08:06,755
Still nothing?

915
01:08:06,757 --> 01:08:09,659
No. Hey, you know what?

916
01:08:09,661 --> 01:08:11,827
Bernie's out there,
swimming with his family.

917
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:13,229
I'm going to give him a go.

918
01:08:13,231 --> 01:08:14,495
If I had a phone,

919
01:08:14,497 --> 01:08:16,597
if I had a phone
with one of them cameras,

920
01:08:16,599 --> 01:08:19,601
I woulda taken a picture,
but I don't have a phone.

921
01:08:19,603 --> 01:08:21,335
I don't have a phone.

922
01:08:21,337 --> 01:08:23,938
Nup.

923
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,540
- Ern, can you do me a favour?
- Sure.

924
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:27,341
Can you watch the pub
for a couple of hours?

925
01:08:27,343 --> 01:08:29,243
You know what, I'm gonna
bloody drive out there.

926
01:08:29,245 --> 01:08:31,511
What if they've broken down
and they've got no reception?

927
01:08:31,513 --> 01:08:33,713
It's a three-hour drive
out there.

928
01:08:33,715 --> 01:08:35,315
You're gonna hike it
all the way out there

929
01:08:35,317 --> 01:08:36,717
for a couple of old pissheads?

930
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,420
Maybe they're just sleeping off
a hangover.

931
01:08:40,422 --> 01:08:42,421
Then that way I'll kick
both their asses

932
01:08:42,423 --> 01:08:43,422
to Timbuk-fucking-tu.

933
01:08:43,424 --> 01:08:45,559
So can you watch the pub for me?

934
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:48,595
Yep, I'll look after
the bar for you, honey.

935
01:08:48,597 --> 01:08:49,863
I've got this, mate.

936
01:08:49,865 --> 01:08:52,731
Fuck no, I want stock
when I get back.

937
01:08:52,733 --> 01:08:54,666
Everything's here in the folder

938
01:08:54,668 --> 01:08:56,835
but Tina's gonna be in
in a couple of hours anyway.

939
01:08:56,837 --> 01:08:58,670
She knows where everything is.

940
01:08:58,672 --> 01:09:01,372
Alright, thank you so much,
darling.

941
01:09:01,374 --> 01:09:02,740
You want me to come with ya?

942
01:09:02,742 --> 01:09:05,410
No, I want you to stay here
and keep drinking, right?

943
01:09:05,412 --> 01:09:06,678
I've got rent due
at the end of the week

944
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,946
and that goes
for the lot of you.

945
01:09:07,948 --> 01:09:10,682
Yeah, well, all the drinks
are on Ernie!

946
01:09:12,586 --> 01:09:14,851
Free drinks if you're black.

947
01:09:14,853 --> 01:09:16,453
You white fellas
are paying double.

948
01:09:16,455 --> 01:09:19,425
I'm going outside
for a quick suntan.

949
01:09:27,365 --> 01:09:29,364
What the fuck is that?

950
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:35,641
Whoa! What the fuck?!

951
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,510
What the fuck is that?

952
01:09:40,944 --> 01:09:42,911
It's a fucking pig.

953
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:48,250
Shit! Oh, my God!

954
01:09:48,252 --> 01:09:49,783
That's insane!

955
01:09:59,561 --> 01:10:01,463
- Fuck this, I'm out of here!
- Argh!

956
01:10:02,764 --> 01:10:04,667
Fucking coward!

957
01:10:39,498 --> 01:10:41,234
Run!

958
01:10:43,868 --> 01:10:45,371
Mum.

959
01:10:46,505 --> 01:10:49,738
Mum! Something's wrong.

960
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:51,539
Run!

961
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:52,740
Run!

962
01:10:55,313 --> 01:10:57,079
- Run!
- What's that, hon?

963
01:10:57,081 --> 01:10:59,315
- Run!
- I can see Robert.

964
01:10:59,317 --> 01:11:03,950
- Run away!
- He's alone and he's running.

965
01:11:03,952 --> 01:11:05,419
He looks scared.

966
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:07,424
What the fuck?

967
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:10,426
- Run away!
- Where's Bruce?

968
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,459
Run!

969
01:11:12,461 --> 01:11:16,999
- I think he wants us to run.
- Where's Bruce?

970
01:11:19,868 --> 01:11:21,635
I don't like this.
Something's wrong.

971
01:11:21,637 --> 01:11:22,802
No, hang on.

972
01:11:22,804 --> 01:11:24,938
There's a wild fucking pig!

973
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:28,010
Poor bugger's scared
of a wild pig.

974
01:11:29,476 --> 01:11:31,344
Where's Bruce, Mum?

975
01:11:31,346 --> 01:11:34,513
Where is Bruce?

976
01:11:34,515 --> 01:11:36,849
He's dead.

977
01:11:36,851 --> 01:11:38,616
What did you say?

978
01:11:38,618 --> 01:11:41,919
He's full of shit.

979
01:11:41,921 --> 01:11:45,592
- Did he say 'dead'?
- Watch out!

980
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on, let's go!
- Robbie!
- Let's go!
Robbie!

981
01:11:53,832 --> 01:11:55,798
Come on, baby, we've got to go!

982
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,004
We've got to go now.
You have to come.

983
01:11:59,371 --> 01:12:01,571
- Come on, Elli!
- Get up!

984
01:12:01,573 --> 01:12:03,139
Get up!

985
01:12:03,141 --> 01:12:05,908
Come on, take this!

986
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:07,676
Come on, Elli. Get up!

987
01:12:07,678 --> 01:12:09,378
Robbie!

988
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:12,084
Robbie!

989
01:12:18,388 --> 01:12:19,888
Come on! Give me that.

990
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:21,956
Get to the other side!
Don't look back!

991
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,994
Fucking go!

992
01:12:26,762 --> 01:12:29,533
Come on!

993
01:12:35,837 --> 01:12:37,541
Come on!

994
01:12:40,175 --> 01:12:41,974
Come on.

995
01:12:41,976 --> 01:12:43,912
Come on, Elli!

996
01:12:48,116 --> 01:12:53,552
I don't want to die.

997
01:12:53,554 --> 01:12:56,424
Get up!

998
01:13:12,806 --> 01:13:14,906
Come on, Bart, hurry up.

999
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,662
Come on!

1000
01:14:28,707 --> 01:14:30,176
Fucking hell!

1001
01:14:33,179 --> 01:14:34,881
Bart!

1002
01:14:36,549 --> 01:14:38,684
Mum!

1003
01:14:45,624 --> 01:14:48,291
Don't move, baby.

1004
01:14:48,293 --> 01:14:50,759
Don't move!

1005
01:14:50,761 --> 01:14:53,127
Mum!

1006
01:14:58,102 --> 01:15:00,171
Mum! Mum!

1007
01:15:01,204 --> 01:15:04,707
- No!
- No!

1008
01:15:17,586 --> 01:15:20,620
Come on! Go!

1009
01:15:20,622 --> 01:15:22,725
Come on! Come on!

1010
01:15:33,768 --> 01:15:36,168
Come on! Come on!

1011
01:15:49,148 --> 01:15:50,247
Oh, God, no.

1012
01:15:50,249 --> 01:15:52,683
Come on! We just need to get up
there. We'll be safe.

1013
01:15:52,685 --> 01:15:55,254
Where?

1014
01:15:56,355 --> 01:15:58,191
Go. Go, go!

1015
01:16:03,595 --> 01:16:05,831
- Help me!
- I'm trying!

1016
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,622
Come on.

1017
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:48,934
Fuck! Fuck!

1018
01:16:48,936 --> 01:16:50,904
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1019
01:16:54,173 --> 01:16:55,706
I'm OK. I'm OK.

1020
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:58,844
It's OK. I'm OK.

1021
01:16:58,846 --> 01:17:00,848
Take care of your mum.

1022
01:17:17,261 --> 01:17:20,430
Why did you let my son die?

1023
01:17:20,432 --> 01:17:24,066
Why, Bernie, why didn't you try
to save him?

1024
01:17:24,068 --> 01:17:25,334
I'm sorry, sis.

1025
01:17:25,336 --> 01:17:27,703
Why didn't you save
my son?

1026
01:17:27,705 --> 01:17:30,739
Why didn't you fucking try?

1027
01:17:30,741 --> 01:17:33,074
- Why? Why?
- I'm so sorry.

1028
01:17:33,076 --> 01:17:35,946
Why, Bernie?

1029
01:17:48,991 --> 01:17:50,993
It's OK, Mum.

1030
01:17:53,796 --> 01:17:56,065
Bart might be OK.

1031
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,335
We have to stay positive.

1032
01:18:01,435 --> 01:18:05,971
No. He's gone.

1033
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:09,978
They're all gone.
They're all dead.

1034
01:18:11,011 --> 01:18:12,980
They're all dead!

1035
01:18:15,214 --> 01:18:17,414
There's only one way we're gonna
make it through this.

1036
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:20,787
We need to kill that overgrown
diseased fucker.

1037
01:18:22,455 --> 01:18:27,292
How do we... how do we kill it?
We don't have a gun.

1038
01:18:41,806 --> 01:18:44,439
How did it get so big?

1039
01:18:44,441 --> 01:18:47,175
- That's not normal, is it?
- No.

1040
01:18:47,177 --> 01:18:49,045
It's definitely not normal,
Ell.

1041
01:18:49,047 --> 01:18:51,079
I've never seen a boar
that size.

1042
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:53,380
How are we
going to kill it, Bernie?

1043
01:18:53,382 --> 01:18:55,983
We don't have a gun!

1044
01:18:55,985 --> 01:18:58,186
It's OK.

1045
01:18:58,188 --> 01:19:00,222
It's not OK!

1046
01:19:00,224 --> 01:19:02,455
It... it took my boy.

1047
01:19:02,457 --> 01:19:05,896
- It took my baby boy.
- It's OK, Mum.

1048
01:19:07,229 --> 01:19:09,899
I'm so sorry, Deb. I'm sorry.

1049
01:19:14,535 --> 01:19:16,137
Bernie.

1050
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:25,247
My baby.

1051
01:19:46,265 --> 01:19:48,201
Is she asleep?

1052
01:19:49,568 --> 01:19:53,436
Yeah. It's really cold.

1053
01:19:53,438 --> 01:19:55,905
Do you think we could use some
of this wood in here

1054
01:19:55,907 --> 01:19:58,477
to start a fire and keep warm?

1055
01:20:00,979 --> 01:20:02,781
Don't see why not.

1056
01:20:05,049 --> 01:20:07,115
So we have a lighter
but no gun.

1057
01:20:07,117 --> 01:20:09,051
I thought you were asleep.

1058
01:20:09,053 --> 01:20:12,154
Could you sleep?

1059
01:20:12,156 --> 01:20:14,488
I'm going to go outside,
grab more wood and kindling.

1060
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:16,291
It'll make it easier
to start a fire.

1061
01:20:16,293 --> 01:20:19,193
- No, don't do that. It's OK.
- It's alright.

1062
01:20:19,195 --> 01:20:20,530
It's just out there.

1063
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:26,265
You guys keep an eye out the
window for me while I'm outside.

1064
01:20:26,267 --> 01:20:28,935
Bernie, don't... don't go.

1065
01:20:28,937 --> 01:20:30,304
Please don't go, no.

1066
01:20:30,306 --> 01:20:32,973
It's alright, I've got my knife.

1067
01:20:32,975 --> 01:20:34,140
Ready?

1068
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No.

1069
01:21:00,366 --> 01:21:02,134
Bernie, get it!

1070
01:21:06,906 --> 01:21:11,074
Come on, behind me.
Slowly. Slowly, slowly.

1071
01:21:11,076 --> 01:21:13,979
Take it easy, big fella.

1072
01:21:19,049 --> 01:21:21,483
Now, when I say run,

1073
01:21:21,485 --> 01:21:23,519
you fucking run, OK?

1074
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:25,419
- Where do we run?
- That way.

1075
01:21:25,421 --> 01:21:27,124
Right behind the barn.

1076
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:31,862
Don't you hurt me, big fella.

1077
01:21:34,998 --> 01:21:36,932
OK.

1078
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:39,066
Run!

1079
01:21:39,068 --> 01:21:42,038
Go! Go, Elli, go, go.

1080
01:22:33,484 --> 01:22:36,419
Let's do this, you ugly fuck!

1081
01:22:36,421 --> 01:22:38,289
Bring that shit!

1082
01:24:18,648 --> 01:24:21,548
We've been walking for ages,
Mum.

1083
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:25,052
I think we should set up a heap
of spot fires and get warm.

1084
01:24:25,054 --> 01:24:27,457
What about the pig?
What if it comes back?

1085
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:32,659
Bart told me about a documentary
he watched on grizzly bears.

1086
01:24:32,661 --> 01:24:34,794
He said they're scared of fire.

1087
01:24:34,796 --> 01:24:37,762
Maybe it scares off pigs too.
It's worth a shot, Mum.

1088
01:24:37,764 --> 01:24:41,266
He's a good boy, my Bart.

1089
01:24:41,268 --> 01:24:45,339
OK, baby, yeah. Let's... let's
build Bart's fires, eh?

1090
01:24:52,345 --> 01:24:54,347
Maybe he'll find us that way.

1091
01:25:35,718 --> 01:25:37,585
What are you doing?

1092
01:25:37,587 --> 01:25:39,620
I'm making hand-held torches.

1093
01:25:39,622 --> 01:25:42,723
Like the ones Bart and Bruce
made on that camping trip

1094
01:25:42,725 --> 01:25:44,326
a few years back.

1095
01:25:46,262 --> 01:25:49,632
That's a good idea.
I'll make one too.

1096
01:25:53,868 --> 01:25:55,837
He taught me so much.

1097
01:25:59,507 --> 01:26:02,076
Do you think Uncle Bernie
killed it?

1098
01:26:04,845 --> 01:26:07,849
If anyone could kill it
it would be Uncle Bernie, OK?

1099
01:26:43,346 --> 01:26:45,516
Mum, just grab one of mine
and light it.

1100
01:26:53,857 --> 01:26:56,159
Oh, it works.

1101
01:27:14,808 --> 01:27:16,410
Get back.

1102
01:27:27,387 --> 01:27:29,490
OK. OK, OK.

1103
01:27:37,863 --> 01:27:40,333
Get away!

1104
01:28:36,751 --> 01:28:39,721
Fuck! Fuck!

1105
01:28:42,689 --> 01:28:44,458
Is she OK?

1106
01:28:45,559 --> 01:28:46,724
It's OK.

1107
01:28:46,726 --> 01:28:48,294
It's OK. I'm alright,
I'm alright.

1108
01:28:58,604 --> 01:29:00,504
Jack was right.

1109
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:04,940
Debbie, go and get the rifle

1110
01:29:04,942 --> 01:29:06,745
out of the back seat of the car,
quick.

1111
01:29:40,009 --> 01:29:41,877
Just breathe!

1112
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:46,616
Kill it, Mum!

1113
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:10,836
- Is he dead?
- Yeah. It's dead.

1114
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:12,739
Come on. Let's go.

1115
01:30:54,677 --> 01:30:56,746
You've got to be kidding me.

1116
01:30:58,114 --> 01:30:59,814
It's them.

1117
01:30:59,816 --> 01:31:01,718
Oh, God!

1118
01:31:06,555 --> 01:31:08,621
Bart!

1119
01:31:08,623 --> 01:31:10,823
Bernie.

1120
01:31:10,825 --> 01:31:14,628
Oh, come on, let's go.
You right?

1121
01:31:20,001 --> 01:31:23,035
Takes more than a monster boy
to keep you down, hey, Bernie?

1122
01:31:23,037 --> 01:31:24,872
You've got no idea!

1123
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:28,539
We're going to the city
tomorrow.

1124
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:30,607
Bernie, you're coming with us.

1125
01:31:30,609 --> 01:31:32,813
I think I might fucking join ya.

1126
01:32:02,154 --> 01:32:07,154
