1
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,359
Oh, my God.
Enough, camera addict.

2
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,046
Man: Okay, okay.
Just a second, though.

3
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,309
Before I turn it off, what is
your New Year's resolution?

4
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,664
Ha! Really?

5
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,182
Yeah, I want to get it on tape
so that I can hold you to it.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,452
Please, you don't keep those.

7
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,666
That is a fantastic attitude
you have right there.

8
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,171
We're going to this time.

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,674
Yeah? All right, fine.
( clears throat )

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,130
I solemnly swear

11
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,716
on this New Year's resolution

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,473
to go to the gym
and get in shape.

13
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:49,804
Oh, hell, yeah.

14
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,248
How about you, ladybug?
What's your New Year's resolution?

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,478
What's that?

16
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,312
It's like a vow or a promise that
you make to be a better person.

17
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,568
Yeah, or always eat
your spinach.

18
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,478
- Yuck.
- Okay, I got one for you.

19
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,325
How about you tell your mommy
that you love her at least once a day?

20
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,450
- Okay.
- You can start right now.

21
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,736
- I love you, Mom.
- How about you, Fishbone?

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,495
What's your resolution?

23
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,702
- Your turn.
- My resolution.

24
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,832
To make a documentary
about this family

25
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,710
so that I can show
the whole world

26
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,415
what a lucky guy I am.

27
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,339
- Woman: You are a lucky guy.
- That's right.

28
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:22,291
And I thank God every day.

29
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,050
If only you believed in God.

30
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,769
Yeah, that'd probably help
a little bit.

31
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,258
Oh, crap.
You know what?

32
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,781
I didn't put change in that meter.
We're gonna get a ticket.

33
00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:31,600
- Dad, can you help me?
- What's up?

34
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,878
- Here, I got it.
- You sure?

35
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,303
- Yup.
- Thanks, babe.

36
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,687
So, Beverly,
your psychic powers,

37
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,652
when did you first
discover them?

38
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,533
Well, everyone's born
with them, you know.

39
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:52,117
But most folks don't know
how to develop them.

40
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,656
Man:
And your predictions,

41
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,462
how many of them you think
have come true?

42
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:57,788
Well, all of them.

43
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,328
( laughs )

44
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,462
Man: Have you ever felt like
you were preying

45
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,340
on someone's superstitions?

46
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,171
Or their emotions?

47
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,336
You know, for example,
like telling a mother

48
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,880
that her missing son
would return alive

49
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,017
or breaking up a family
by advising for divorce.

50
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,935
You know what I mean?
Have you ever felt like

51
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,062
you led somebody down
the wrong path?

52
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,393
No, I don't think so.

53
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,308
You know, it's interesting,

54
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,898
my wife, she's always
wanted to go to Europe.

55
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,029
I finally put
this big trip together,

56
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,862
then at the last second,
she cancels.

57
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,901
She says that she needed
to be here

58
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,742
for this big break
in her acting career.

59
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,204
A break that you told her
was coming.

60
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,368
I did.

61
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,005
And I'm guessing it hasn't, huh?

62
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,916
No.

63
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,215
It will.

64
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,925
Yeah, I don't think so.

65
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,261
And why is that?

66
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,765
She's dead.

67
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,975
Her name was Samantha.
Samantha King.

68
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,143
Yeah. She'd been coming
to you for years.

69
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,363
Oh, Sa...

70
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,900
Oh, Samantha.
Oh, gosh.

71
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,319
Fluke accident.
Wrong place, wrong time.

72
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,954
But, you know,
the funny thing is

73
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:20,459
is that if we'd been
on that trip,

74
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,837
if she hadn't listened to you
and we'd gone to Europe,

75
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,668
she'd still be alive.

76
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,708
Oh, God.

77
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,467
Oh, you can't think that I had...

78
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,051
You were giving her
spiritual guidance.

79
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,966
Guidance based on visions
you were receiving

80
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,852
from beyond the veil,
from higher powers, right?

81
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,182
And these visions,

82
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,474
they interfered
with her life, Beverly.

83
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,689
And she is dead
as a direct result.

84
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,277
I am deeply sorry for your loss.

85
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,191
Okay, then admit it.
Admit it.

86
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,201
Admit that all this,
this is just a scam.

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,456
That what you claim to do,
your psychic routine...

88
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,491
this is just a show, right?

89
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,660
This is a performance here.

90
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,333
Come on, Beverly.
Come on.

91
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,878
I'm afraid that I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

92
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,632
Please?

93
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,520
Man:
What happens when you die?

94
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,225
I mean, everybody
has a theory, a guess,

95
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,018
a story that they'd like
to believe.

96
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,405
But at the end of the day,
we don't know.

97
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,191
Our ancestors worshiped fire

98
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,406
and sacrificed children
to vengeful gods.

99
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,872
We didn't know any better
back then.

100
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,284
What's our excuse now?

101
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,872
It's the 21st century,

102
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,914
yet we're still arguing evolution
versus creationism.

103
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,752
And Why?

104
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,885
Because the truth scares people.

105
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,296
Nobody wants to die.

106
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,216
Nobody wants to cease to exist.

107
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,602
We want to believe
that if we follow a set of rules,

108
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:06,186
rules that were laid out
by some ancient, made-up god,

109
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,522
we're gonna continue on
in heaven as a spirit.

110
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,561
We're gonna be reincarnated.

111
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,399
While all that sounds great,

112
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,442
is any of it authentic?

113
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,327
I mean, what's the truth?

114
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,240
See, the truth is
that religion and spiritualism

115
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,706
are the most profitable
businesses in the world.

116
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,415
That throughout history,

117
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,751
there's never been
a single shred of evidence

118
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,008
that any of it is real.

119
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,795
Well, I've decided to prove it.

120
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,431
I want to test
the most authentic spells,

121
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,138
rituals, and summonings
that I can find.

122
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,513
I'm only going after the blackest
of the black magic.

123
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,479
The stuff that people
are scared of.

124
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,234
So that when they don't work,

125
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,020
people will pay attention.

126
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,733
And maybe, just maybe,

127
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,776
the world can take a step forward
collectively into reality.

128
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,823
The cameras will be rolling
on me 24/7

129
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,493
in the hopes that
if I uncover anything,

130
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,252
anything at all,

131
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,837
I'll have found the first ever
documented proof.

132
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,427
I'm the testing ground.

133
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,180
Me, Michael King.

134
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,184
So, God or the devil,

135
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,310
if you're out there,

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
prove it.
Come and get me.

137
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,856
Ladybug, what are you doing?

138
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,650
Why are you up?

139
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,448
I had a scary dream.

140
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,831
Uh-oh. Come here.
What was it about?

141
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,491
A monster.

142
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,206
A monster? Okay.

143
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,623
Well, I wouldn't be surprised
if this particular monster

144
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,009
is a tickle monster.

145
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,340
- (growls )
- ( laughing )

146
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,879
Come on.
Come here, come here.

147
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,639
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no.

148
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,845
See, Fishbone's right.
Old Crowley here...

149
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,408
old Crowley here is the best defense
against tickle monsters.

150
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,805
- Get away! Get away!
- What are you doing?

151
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,131
- Hey, sis.
- What's going on?

152
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,188
Oh, we are...
she had a nightmare.

153
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,773
Yeah, take Crowley with you.

154
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,609
Hey, listen.

155
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,865
Why don't I get in bed with you

156
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,823
and make sure that there are
no more monsters?

157
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,030
- Okay,
- Okay?

158
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,490
I think that's a great idea.

159
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,371
I'm really good
at fending off monsters.

160
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,531
Aunt Beth is the best.
Hey, young lady.

161
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,200
Where do you think you're going?

162
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,745
Are you okay?
All right, give me kisses.

163
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,727
- I love you.
- I love you, too, Dad.

164
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:37,413
Crowley's gonna
take care of you, okay?

165
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:38,675
- And Fishbone.
- Okay.

166
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,882
What is all this stuff, Michael?

167
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,548
I mean, you wonder why
she's getting all these nightmares?

168
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,136
Seriously?

169
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,927
It's my new project.

170
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,563
Oh, right.

171
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,064
What?

172
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,396
I thought that you would
be happy, of all people,

173
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,402
to see me, you know, getting back
to work and moving on.

174
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,316
This isn't really
moving on, Michael.

175
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,325
- Well, it is for me.
- Okay.

176
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,955
I'm gonna go put her to bed.

177
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,617
Okay, so last night
I posted an ad.

178
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,582
Documentary filmmaker seeks
proof of the supernatural.

179
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,089
There must be, I don't know,
over 300 hits on this thing already.

180
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,626
We've got Satanists,
voodoo, necromancy.

181
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,419
I even have a priest on here.

182
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,679
I guess that's Los Angeles
for you, right?

183
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,119
We're gonna have no shortage
of material, that's for sure.

184
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,392
Cameraman: What if one of these
fucking Satanists is a serial killer?

185
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,848
- What then?
- Are you serious?

186
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,514
Don't be such a pussy.

187
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,183
So, Father Gibbons,

188
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,727
the Church won't talk
about it publically,

189
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,692
but behind closed doors
you claim

190
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,607
they're performing exorcisms.

191
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,159
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

192
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,288
Okay. And these demons
that they're exercising,

193
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,745
is there any proof
that they're real?

194
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,284
A physical proof?

195
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,954
Like horns and brimstone?

196
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,122
Fire, that kind of thing?

197
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,462
Well, any kind of thing.

198
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,424
I just don't understand
why there's never been

199
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:05,450
any documented evidence.

200
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,965
What makes you think
there's not?

201
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,055
I haven't seen any.

202
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,719
Well, I mean, of course
you haven't.

203
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,684
You haven't been allowed to.

204
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,560
Okay, listen,
you stated in your e-mail

205
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:24,448
that you had a real experience,
real proof,

206
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,485
but you don't, do you?

207
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,243
<i>Okay</i> '

208
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,497
When I was 10,

209
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,202
my father...

210
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,411
he started
to take advantage of me.

211
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,248
Every night he would
come into my room...

212
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,836
( bells tolling )

213
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,001
...close the door...

214
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,261
My mother, she must have known.

215
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,676
She prayed all the time.

216
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,970
That was her remedy.

217
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,355
God.

218
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,107
Well, I prayed to God,

219
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,690
but He never stopped
my father, not once.

220
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,776
So I gave up on God.

221
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,446
Started to pray to the devil.
( coughs )

222
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,279
Told him I would do anything

223
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,539
if he'd just make
my father stop.

224
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,877
Well, one night not long after,

225
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,879
in the middle of one
of his visits,

226
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,042
my father had a heart attack.

227
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,461
Died on the spot.

228
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,593
Wow.

229
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,429
That's awful.

230
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,811
I mean, what happened to you,
it's awful.

231
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,517
But come on.

232
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,652
I mean, how is that anything more
than just a strange coincidence?

233
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,689
Well, not long after, I...

234
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,570
began to hear him

235
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,612
calling out to me,

236
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,156
saying things.

237
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,075
I mean, awful, awful things.

238
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,244
The devil?

239
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,127
You hear him...

240
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,589
you don't answer.

241
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,305
Because if you do,
he will know you're listening

242
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:16,434
and he will never let you go.

243
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,264
Michael:
Hmm.

244
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,273
Right.

245
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,436
Thank you for your time.
Appreciate it.

246
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,700
I ordered a demon summoning kit
off the Internet.

247
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,285
I lit the traditionally
evil-looking black candles.

248
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,449
I even sprung
for the expensive incense

249
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,165
because their Internet site said

250
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,331
that the demons get insulted
by the cheap stuff.

251
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:50,427
Got one plastic ritual altar.

252
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,303
Nice. Very nice.

253
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,557
And one photocopied booklet.

254
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,685
A lot of money went
into that guy right there, huh?

255
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,063
I also used Ellie's coloring set
to draw my symbols.

256
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,066
Somehow crayons
seemed appropriate.

257
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,943
So basically
what you do is this.

258
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,229
You draw the symbol

259
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,524
for the demon
that you wish to summon.

260
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,192
All right?

261
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,112
You read the spell from this.

262
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,662
Then you light it,

263
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,497
put it in the altar.

264
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,333
Voila.

265
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,543
( French accent ) Instant demon.

266
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,383
Well, surprise, surprise,

267
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,669
the demons were a no-show.

268
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,514
Although...

269
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,643
( groans )
...something's happening.

270
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,977
( Growls )

271
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,141
Okay, there's no demon.

272
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,185
It was worth a shot.

273
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,946
So we got in touch
with a demonologist.

274
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,488
And after negotiating a small...
well, smallish... fee,

275
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,157
we've convinced him
to summon a demon for us.

276
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,325
- ( Knocks )
- Man: Just a sec.

277
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,879
Hi. Michael King.

278
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,960
This is Jordan.

279
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,875
So why do people
always summon demons,

280
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,793
never angels?

281
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,088
People summon angels
all the time.

282
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,847
They just don't want
to interfere.

283
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,680
Now, demons, on the other hand,

284
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,095
they're just dying to come here.

285
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,434
It's most tempting to do that
when we're kind of weak,

286
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,939
out of sorts.

287
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,817
Some people meditate for years
to achieve the proper mind set,

288
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,321
but we use tricks...

289
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,574
to get us there faster.

290
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,740
- Michael: Uh, grape juice?
- With LSD.

291
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,745
How much LSD?

292
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,872
If you're nervous
about this part,

293
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,126
we should stop right now.

294
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,918
There are two prevalent methods
for summoning demons.

295
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,084
The first is by offering
the demon something up front.

296
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,424
A human life,
continued servitude,

297
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,430
your own soul.

298
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,717
I don't recommend those paths

299
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,136
as once performed
they're very hard to undo.

300
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,396
The second method entails
creating the type

301
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,478
of frenetic atmosphere
demons are drawn to...

302
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,268
chaos, blood,

303
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,109
sex, violence.

304
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,898
I'll need some of your essence.

305
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,817
Uh, saliva?

306
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,906
Semen.

307
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,954
( Chuckles )
You're kidding, right?

308
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,793
And I have to get it
in this cup?

309
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,204
- Bathroom's right over there.
- Okay.

310
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,545
Ever hear of auto writing?
Scrying? Psychography?

311
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,210
It's how we're going
to pick your demon,

312
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,345
- the one we're going to summon.
- Okay.

313
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,632
Close your eyes.

314
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,269
Now, clear your mind.

315
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,480
Open yourself up to the beyond.

316
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,728
Allow their energy
to flow through you,

317
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,113
to use you.

318
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,284
Let their energy flow.

319
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,787
Breathe.

320
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,041
Breathe.

321
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,731
I'm sorry, I'm not very susceptible
to this kind of stuff.

322
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,081
- I'm sorry.
- You did just fine.

323
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,682
Just a minute here.

324
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,310
So what are we looking for here?
What's this?

325
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,562
To see if the image
that you drew

326
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,223
matches up
with one of the demons.

327
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,484
And you think that I drew this?

328
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,440
Look.

329
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,071
Daungore.

330
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,278
"Commander of 37 legions.

331
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,819
Seeker of the defenseless,
the weak-spirited,

332
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,737
the nonbeliever.

333
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,281
Known also as the Great Mocker,

334
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,201
Destroyer of Thought,
Breeder of Ants,

335
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,459
Stealer of Children.

336
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,121
He comes accompanied by
the sound of cacophonous music,

337
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,881
staying with the conjurer

338
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,758
until tormentum
in dum demens."

339
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,511
It's Latin for

340
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,594
"torture until madness."

341
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,437
I feel pretty weird, man.

342
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,733
( laughs )
Okay, look at this, man.

343
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,442
This look safe to you?
This is fucked up.

344
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,073
This is fucked up.
Look at all this plastic.

345
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,407
They're gonna kill me in here.
That's what they're gonna do.

346
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,617
Oh, my God.

347
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,998
I'm losing my mind.
This is a bad idea.

348
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
This is bad.
Jordan, check this out.
Dude, maybe we should
get the fuck out of here.

349
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,926
Oh, my God, what the fuck
have we gotten ourselves into?

350
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,348
(speaking Latin )

351
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,151
Oh, shit.

352
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,821
These are real.

353
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,611
( Continues speaking Latin )

354
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,076
( laughs )

355
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,825
Satan. Lucifer.

356
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,793
( Continues speaking Latin,
snaps fingers )

357
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,300
Michael: Okay, so what
are you doing here?

358
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,480
Michael:
I'm freaking out a little bit.

359
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,719
( Both speaking Latin )

360
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,181
Michael:
Oh, God. Oh, God.

361
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,971
Jordan? Jordan, what the fuck
is going on, man?

362
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,139
Jordan: Something's
fucking up the camera.

363
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,526
- I can't see shit.
- ( groaning )

364
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,313
( continues speaking Latin )

365
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,027
Jordan:
Hey, hey, hey!

366
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,784
Michael, are you okay?
Are you all right?

367
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,820
Oh, shit.

368
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,740
( Continues speaking Latin )

369
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,331
Jordan:
She's got a knife.

370
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,130
Get that fucking knife
off of him!

371
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,011
- Get it off of him!
- ( shouting )

372
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,467
Jesus Christ!

373
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,509
( Grunting, screaming )

374
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:44,045
(sighs )

375
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,262
Well...

376
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,300
that was, like, some kind of
satanic porn shoot.

377
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,728
The smell in there, right?

378
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,231
And you paid him.
( laughs )

379
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,892
Come on, man, shh.
Seriously, turn that off.

380
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,989
So you want me
to order you some chili?

381
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,900
Runny eggs?

382
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,035
Or how about a cup
of bloody jizz?

383
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,743
Don't. Don't. Don't.
I'm never eating again.

384
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,492
At least enjoy the acid.
Ready?

385
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,081
You're running through a forest.
You're running through a forest.

386
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,764
Don't, dude. Don't.
Seriously, come on.

387
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,665
I hate you.
Turn it off.

388
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
( Screams )

389
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:57,906
So necromancy is considered
the blackest of the black arts.

390
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,915
Why is that?

391
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,701
Well...

392
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:07,461
I think it gets most of its bad rap

393
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,718
because of the method employed
in performing it.

394
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,755
You mean dealing with corpses,
graves, funeral rites.

395
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,015
Right, right.
That kind of creeps people out.

396
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,470
Sure.

397
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,806
But as a mortician,

398
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,812
it's all part of my day job.

399
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,729
And as far as the magic goes...

400
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,986
it's really no different

401
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,694
than what any of these
mediums are doing

402
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,326
except we just employ
a slightly different method

403
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,488
in raising the dead.

404
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,291
Teeth taken from
our little friend over there.

405
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,833
Mortician:
A freshly deceased body

406
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:54,049
works best because the soul
may still be lingering.

407
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,804
Then we can kind of confuse it.

408
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,967
You know, make it think
that it's still alive

409
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,012
and that all it needs to do is just
get back inside of its living body.

410
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,397
<i>Okay.</i>

411
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,354
This is a mild anesthetic

412
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,520
similar to Novocain.

413
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,531
- Okay. Doing all right?
- Yeah.

414
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,947
Okay, it'll start to numb
in just a couple minutes.

415
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,411
The more that we can
make you appear

416
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:27,169
like that body the soul
once inhabited,

417
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,797
the better our chances.

418
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,500
You feel that?

419
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,384
- No.
- Okay.

420
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,716
Mortician:
The astral corpse,

421
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,177
it wants to keep living.

422
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,718
Living is what it knows.

423
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,058
You know? And unless
it's already grown accustomed

424
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,441
to the afterlife,
it's what's normal.

425
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,320
And it's desperate
to cling on to that.

426
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,950
The Sonoran Desert toad

427
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,861
contains dimethyltryptamine,

428
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,497
or DMT,

429
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:07,377
the most powerful psychedelic
on the planet.

430
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,090
The human body produces DMT.

431
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,216
It's released when we die.

432
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,174
It helps us pass
to the other side.

433
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,589
But taking it
while we're still living

434
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,259
simulates a near-death
experience.

435
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,269
I'm going to need to let it dry.

436
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,520
Prepare it.

437
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,059
It's gonna take some time.

438
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,273
We need to wait
until it's dark anyhow.

439
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,870
This Novocain is wearing off
on my stomach,

440
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,445
so this is starting to hurt
like a bitch, man.

441
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,623
Oh, there he is.

442
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,410
Hey, sorry we're late.
I got all turned around in here.

443
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:52,706
Jesus Christ.
Did you kill these...

444
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,294
did you kill these things?

445
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,458
The toads, their pain,

446
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,255
agony, it creates
this sort of energy

447
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,265
that draws in the spirits.

448
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,768
Assume the position.

449
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,394
On your back.

450
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,521
Right.

451
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,024
The smell of burning DMT

452
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,401
can be intensely nauseating.

453
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,235
Like burning plastic.

454
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,402
Now, as it takes effect,

455
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,321
the world will shatter

456
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,331
and your body
will quickly follow.

457
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,834
You may feel like
you're starting to die,

458
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,496
like you don't know
how to breathe at all.

459
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,380
But it's okay.

460
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,507
You just need to let go

461
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,670
- and go with it.
- ( groaning )

462
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,175
To Almighty God

463
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,345
we commend
our brother Michael...

464
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,143
and commit his body
to the ground.

465
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:55,526
<i>Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.</i>

466
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,903
Roland Sykes.

467
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,235
Roland Sykes,

468
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:04,072
reclaim your physical body.

469
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,328
- Take this body. Shit!
- ( sirens wail )

470
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,647
- Cop: You, hey!
- Mortician: Get the fuck out of here.

471
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:10,537
- Cop: Get on your knees!
- Jordan: Michael.

472
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,701
- Where are you?
- Cop #2: They're running.

473
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,253
Oh, fuck me.

474
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,713
( Panting )

475
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,799
Cop: He's making
a break for it. Hey!

476
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,598
- There he goes!
- Jordan: Michael.

477
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,226
( Door squeaks )

478
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,612
Jordan:
Hey, you in here?

479
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,652
Michael, you in here?

480
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,110
Michael.

481
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,507
- Strange voice: Crawl.
- ( Jordan gasps )

482
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,670
- Crawl!
- ( door slams )

483
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,224
( Jordan grunting )

484
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,226
Fuck!

485
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,438
- Crawl.
- Jordan: What is that?

486
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,694
What the fuck is going on here?

487
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,605
Crawl.

488
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,240
Shit. Michael.

489
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,821
Michael.

490
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,032
Come on, get down, man.

491
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,447
Get down from there.
Let's get out of here.

492
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,786
Come on.
Are you okay?

493
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,250
Strange voice:
I don't want to be dead.

494
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,836
- ( Growls)
- Get off, Mike!

495
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,843
- ( Panting )
- Oh, Jesus.

496
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,803
Jordan? Jordan?

497
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,086
Jordan: You're tripping out, man.
It's just the drugs.

498
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,532
Dude, just chill.

499
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,978
Oh, no. No, no.

500
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,689
Fuck. She's gone.

501
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,353
Jordan:
Who's gone?

502
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,819
Sam.

503
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,234
I was with her, man.

504
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,323
I was with Sam.

505
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,284
But she's fucking gone.

506
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,574
Jordan: Come on, let's just get
the fuck out of here.

507
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,500
- Michael: Steal it!
- How did we get so lucky?

508
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,832
- Ellie: Come on!
- Michael: I know, she's amazing.

509
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,838
Fishbone, eh.

510
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,597
He doesn't come
when he's called so much.

511
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,835
- Michael: Yeah.
- Ew, this is gross now, too.

512
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,161
- Here you go. ( gasps )
- No, no, don't give it to me.

513
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:34,893
( Clears throat )

514
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,396
My wife Samantha was...

515
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,143
I mean, I fucking touched her.

516
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,313
You know, and I felt her with...

517
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,528
( clears throat )

518
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,250
And she was trying
to tell me something.

519
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,703
It was...

520
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,613
there was all this interference.

521
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,657
It was like static.

522
00:26:56,824 --> 00:27:00,419
And I couldn't make out
what she was saying.

523
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,413
But she was...

524
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,636
Took a shower.
Got rid of these fucking teeth.

525
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:13,970
Look at this.

526
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,013
I feel like I'm still
coming down from the drugs

527
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:18,346
or something.

528
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,731
And that static sound,

529
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,563
it's, like, still there.

530
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,443
( Sniffles )

531
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,275
I've got to get some sleep.

532
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,358
I can't sleep.
( groans )

533
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:35,246
Man, it's like 4:30, 5:00.
Something like that.

534
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,248
Sun's gonna be coming up soon.

535
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,205
I'm just past the point.

536
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,504
And that noise, it's, like,

537
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,416
now that I've noticed it, I'm...

538
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,927
I'm fixated on it.

539
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,302
Hey there.

540
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,429
We're at this reading
by Erica Bell.

541
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,842
She's a relatively
well-known medium.

542
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,807
And then afterwards
we get to interview her.

543
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,767
So come on, let's <i>check</i> it out.

544
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,181
( <i>Crowd gasps</i> )

545
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,520
Okay, was there something
with her throat?

546
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,185
Her breathing?

547
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,103
She had esophageal cancer.

548
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,272
She wants you to know
she's okay.

549
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,157
- ( Applause )
- She's watching over you.

550
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:15,445
And you're...
no, hang on.

551
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,034
No, wait a minute.
Someone else is butting in here.

552
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,665
Lots of spirits
want to talk today.

553
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,541
This is good. Okay.

554
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,122
All right, somewhere over here.

555
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,414
Yes.
Yes, this is a very strong signal.

556
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,957
Female, I think.

557
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,125
She really,
really wants to talk.

558
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,090
Right, she passed recently.

559
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Happened kind of quickly,
an accident maybe.
Okay, she has a message.
No, that can't be right.
She wants to...
Michael, listen to me.

560
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,306
You need to...

561
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,725
( screams )

562
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,859
- Whoa, whoa.
- ( gasping )

563
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,487
Easy, easy, easy.
Jesus Christ.

564
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,695
What happened?
We're not really sure.

565
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,652
Erica was about
to tell us something

566
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,241
and then she went into
that seizure.

567
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,702
I mean, was she actually
channeling Sam?

568
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,873
Or was that just all
part of her show?

569
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,666
And then the seizure

570
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,176
was just like a strange
coincidence or something.

571
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,587
I don't know.

572
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,051
Ellie: Dad, Fishy peed
on the floor again.

573
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,511
Michael:
Huh? Okay, baby.

574
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,674
Daddy will take care of it
after dinner, all right?

575
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,598
- Thanks. Oh, fuck!
- Jeez.

576
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,764
Why the fuck would you
hand me something like that?

577
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,689
It's scalding hot.

578
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,195
God damn it.

579
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,197
Michael, that's a salad.

580
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,000
Um, I'm sorry.
I'm just...

581
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,918
Daddy's a little tense.
I'm sorry about that.

582
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:50,001
You okay?
I scared you.

583
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,040
( Clears throat )

584
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,630
You Okay?

585
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,795
Yeah.

586
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,886
Have some salad, Ellie.

587
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,984
(sighs )

588
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,570
(sighs )

589
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,243
I thought if I went out today

590
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,454
that I could shake
this noise in my head,

591
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,710
that it would just go away.

592
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,997
( Groans )

593
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,382
( <i>Cracks</i> )

594
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,886
But now that I'm home
and it's quiet, it's like...

595
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,218
( <i>Cracks</i> )

596
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,592
I wish I could describe for you

597
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,386
what this is.

598
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,431
It's this constant barrage,

599
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
this cacophony of sound.
It's like...
it's like...
( roars )

600
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,324
( gasps )

601
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,081
Oh, fuck.

602
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,996
- ( Roaring )
<i>'</i> ( digital squealing )

603
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,881
Okay, so what's the deal again?

604
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:25,301
Like I said,
it came out of my mouth.

605
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,970
Uh-huh. Yeah, no.

606
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,638
Why not?

607
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,729
There's multiple layers
of overtone singing.

608
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,438
Overtone?
What does that mean?

609
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,241
It's when a singer
manipulates their voice

610
00:31:36,407 --> 00:31:38,159
to have multiple pitches
at the same time.

611
00:31:38,326 --> 00:31:41,158
Okay, good.
So then maybe I did it accidentally.

612
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:45,696
Well, even if I bought that,
which I don't, there's more.

613
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,160
Here. Let's see.

614
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,325
- This is a B2.
- ( note plays )

615
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,371
- Okay.
- And this is a C# 7.

616
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,414
( Note plays )

617
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,049
That's a Guinness Book
vocal range right there.

618
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,085
The tape you gave me...

619
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,925
( note playing )

620
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,089
...we're talking F #

621
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,849
all the way...

622
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:12,519
- E25.
- ( high-pitched note )

623
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,358
Some of it's not even audible.

624
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,144
Just barely registering
on my stuff.

625
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,233
Let me ask you this.
Is it possible

626
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,569
that my vocal cords
could have made this?

627
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,699
Not a chance.

628
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,452
If you're not fucking with me,

629
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,930
then there's something wrong
with the audio in your camera.

630
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:29,281
A defect or something.

631
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,917
It's not the camera.

632
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,952
Thanks.

633
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,121
( Loud static hissing )

634
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,087
Beth:
Michael.

635
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,298
Michael.

636
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,805
- ( Turns off static )
- So fricking loud.

637
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,475
Michael?

638
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,852
Hello?

639
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,060
What are you doing?
Hey. Michael.

640
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,724
- ( Growls )
- ( gasps )

641
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,394
Oh, my God.
You scared me.

642
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,312
Let's go.
I've been calling you.

643
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,106
Dinner's ready.

644
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000

- ( high-frequency whining )

00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:31,302
( growling )

647
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,464
( growling continues )

648
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,807
( Fishbone barking )

649
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:22,102
( Michael growling )

650
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,239
Chronic ringing of the ears.

651
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,776
It's a very common condition.
It's called tinnitus.

652
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,866
- You should see an internist.
- I did. I did.

653
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,871
He gave me
a clean bill of health.

654
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,532
Said that it must be
psychosomatic,

655
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,543
that I should see a psychiatrist,
which is why I'm here.

656
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,040
I understand, Michael,
that your wife died recently.

657
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,174
Six months ago, yeah.

658
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,051
Left you alone
with a little girl.

659
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,963
( Clears throat )
Ellie, uh-huh.

660
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,383
You might be going through
some extreme stress

661
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:55,678
trying to deal with thoughts,
feelings, emotions,

662
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:59,394
things that consciously you might
not think you can handle.

663
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,480
And so then they become
side effects.

664
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:06,192
All right, so you think you can,
I don't know,

665
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,324
help me come to grips with this
if that's what it is?

666
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,484
Doctor:
Breathe.

667
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,153
Good.

668
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,541
Let your thoughts,
your conscious,

669
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,918
drift away.

670
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,670
Nice and easy.

671
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,133
We're traveling deep
into your subconscious, Michael.

672
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,045
Deep down inside.

673
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,390
- ( Gasps )
- Michael?

674
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,721
Are you there?
Are you with me?

675
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,896
Michael: Yes.

676
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,728
Doctor:
How are you feeling?

677
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,143
- Michael: Fine.
- Doctor: Good.

678
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,688
That sound in your head,
is it still there?

679
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,401
Michael: Yes.

680
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,864
- Okay.
- But there's something else.

681
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,903
Doctor:
What?

682
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,289
Michael:
I know what the sound is.

683
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,199
Doctor:
What is it, Michael?

684
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,959
Michael:
Voices.

685
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,041
- Voices?
- Yes.

686
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,332
What are they saying?

687
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,918
So many things.

688
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,087
Doctor:
Anything in particular?

689
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,927
- Yes.
- What?

690
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,765
They're saying you will...

691
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,771
Doctor: What?
You will what, Michael?

692
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,728
( Strange voices whispering )

693
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,688
Michael:
You will...

694
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Doctor:
Michael?
Strange voice:
Crawl.

695
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,943
Jordan:
Michael, are you okay?

696
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,327
Michael.

697
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,454
Hey!
What the fuck?

698
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,536
What the fuck is going on?

699
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,622
The camera jumped
out of my hands.

700
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,508
You made some weird voice.

701
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,840
( laughs ) Bullshit.

702
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,800
It's all on the camera.

703
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:58,433
And then you were talking about
all the sounds in your head,

704
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,969
they were voices.

705
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,733
Look, I know this is none
of my business, but...

706
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,730
you think Sam would want you
to be doing this?

707
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:20,034
So Jordan officially
left the project.

708
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,415
Is something really
happening to me?

709
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,372
I mean,
I'm physically exhausted.

710
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,787
I'm drained.

711
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,830
And I was hypnotized, you know?

712
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:33,594
Is it really that surprising
that I spoke in some weird voice?

713
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,972
I mean, I think that Jordan just got
startled and threw the camera.

714
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,841
That's what it looked like.

715
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,844
I don't know.

716

717
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,146
Okay, I'm back.

718
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,107
And this thing
going on in my head,

719
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,364
it's evolving.

720
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,113
It's like I can hear this...

721
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,495

722
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,907

723

or something.

724
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,289
And if I concentrate...

725
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000

I can almost tell
what it's saying.

Crowley loves you.

729
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:40,035
Hey, sweetie.
Did that noise wake you up?

730
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:42,491
That was just the window.
It broke.

731
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,782
It was just the window.
It's okay.

732
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,418
What is it?
You all right?

733
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,546
- The monster.
- Monster?

734
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,757
Oh, from your dream.

735
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:59,592
Okay. Okay.
Let's see.

736
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,802
I'll tell you what.

737
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,184
How about you go back to sleep,

738
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,595
and then maybe Daddy
will show up in your dream

739
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,354
and then he can chase
that monster away.

740
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,015
How's that?

741
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,024
You can't.

742
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,612
Really?
Why is that?

743
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,772
I saw the monster.

744
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,361
Well, that's good.

745
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,492
What did this monster look like?

746
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,450
It's you, Daddy.

747
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,040
It's me?

748
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,794
It's just a bad dream.
You know that, right?

749
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,584
And Daddy would never
hurt you, okay?

750
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,798
No matter what.

751
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,849
Why don't you go get Fishbone

752
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,431
and go get back in bed, okay?

753
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,267
I can't find her.

754
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:50,806

Come on, girl.

What you doing, Fishy?

757
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,695
Let's see, that bird should be
right about here.

758
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,785
Huh. That's weird.

759

Whoa, Jesus Christ!

Fuck.

What the fuck is that?

Michael, what is wrong?

We'll find the dog, okay?

Just relax.

Look, will you please
stop acting like this?

I'm sorry.
I'm just...

- You all right?
- Are you all right?

- Yeah.
- You look like shit.

Have you slept lately?

( Sighs ) Oh, God.

I just can't seem to wind down.

783

Hold on.

00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,219
Here.
Take two of these.

00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,387
- Sleeping pills?
- Yup.

786
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,522
Then you will sleep, believe me.

787
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,775
Feel better in the morning.

788
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,061

a good night's sleep

that this would end.

But these voices,
they're not going away.

00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,645
I need to confront this.

So...

800
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,289
are you real?

801
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,876
Or am I going insane?

802
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,966
Neither is an appealing
choice, but...

803
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:15,134
I suppose one of them
must be true.

804
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,180
I guess I'd rather...

805
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,931

what if I said...

what if I said that you've proved
your existence?

That I believed in you?

- Yeah.

- The Church doesn't do that.
- No, you do it.

I don't feel like myself at all

886
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,257
anymore.

887
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,672
I'm starting to have
these crazy thoughts.

888
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,431
( laughs )

889
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,059
I feel compelled.

890
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:57,097
Like I have to.
Like I have to fucking do it.

891
00:50:57,263 --> 00:51:00,233
( laughing )

892
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,855
( static hissing )

893
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,742
( growling )

894
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,458
Eyes are throbbing like mad.

895
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,999
Can you see this?

896
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:09,385
Aw, it hurts like hell.

897
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,466
I'm fucking slipping.

898
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,757
What?
Oh, my God.

899
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,674
No, God damn it, no!

900
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,763
What the fuck?

901
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the fuck is that?
Oh, my God.

902
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,444
( Beth screaming )

903
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:33,234
What happened?
Beth? Ellie?

904
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,282
Fuck!

905
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,743
( Sobbing )

906
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,500
( panting )

907
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,508
Ellie! Ellie!

908
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,769
- Doll: Crowley loves you.
- Ellie.

909
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,975
- ( Doll cackles )
- Ellie.

910
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,639
Is that Fishy?

911
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:06,309
- No, baby.
- Are you okay?

912
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,944
- Ellie, sweetheart.
- No, no.

913
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,735
Beth, you don't think...

914
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,365
Beth, I didn't.

915
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,822
- Ellie: I don't want to leave Fishy!
- Ellie.

916
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,487
- Let me go!
- Ellie.

917
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:20,372
Oh, God.

918
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,367
Oh.

919
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,832
( Sobbing ) What have I done?

920
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,377
Fish.

921
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,712
You...

922
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,721
you don't have power over me.

923
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,632
You don't.

924
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,893
You think you do, but you don't.

925
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,849
This isn't what I wanted.

926
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,291
This isn't what I wanted at all.

927
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,267
I'm sorry, Sam.

928
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,647
You can't make me do anything.

929
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,986
Shh.
Couldn't make me lower.

930
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:58,119
You are just in my fucking head.
Get out of my head!

931
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,053
( Panting )

932
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,885
( screams )

933
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,569
I thought I almost killed Ellie.

934
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,899
Fishbone was Sam's dog.

935
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,495
- Fuck.
- ( strange voices whispering )

936
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,245
Beth and Ellie,

937
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,081
they're staying with one
of Beth's friends for a few days.

938
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,746
It's getting too hard
to fucking concentrate.

939
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,713
- ( Growling )
- ( strange voices whispering )

940
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Quiet!
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
Stop saying that, God damn it!

941
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,517
Shit! Stop!

942
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,928
"I command you, unclean spirit.

943
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You shall not be emboldened
to harm this creature of God.
You shall not harm him
or those he touches.
I command you,
release this body.
Release this body..."
( screams )

944
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,239
"Turn back this evil
upon my soul.

945
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:24,245
I beseech you, Lord.
I beseech you."

946
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,500
Strange voice:
Burn! Burn!

947
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,128
- Burn!
- Fuck! God damn it!

948
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,335
You can't have this body.

949
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,546
No! No, God damn it!

950
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,760
(groaning )

951
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,801
Fuck! Fuck!

952
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,311
( Screams )

953
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:52,479
God, please!

954
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:56,020
- ( Screaming )
- ( voice gibbering )

955

- ( glass shatters )
- ( cacophony stops )

956
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:58,127
I've tried everything.

957
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:01,669
Protective spells, banishments,

958
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:05,214
charms,
every incantation I can find.

959
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,516
Nothing's worked.

960
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:12,851
The more I try and fight it,
the more it takes over.

961
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,562
Forcing me to do things.

962
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,238
Laughing at me.

963
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,649
It's fucking laughing at me.

964
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,242
You'd think
this really hurts, right?

965
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:37,045
Funny thing is

966
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,172
I can hardly feel it.

967
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:45,254
It's getting harder and harder
to feel anything.

968
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,591
It's like...

969
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,724
none of this is real anymore.

970
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:59,401
( laughs )

971
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,944
It's not real.
( laughing )

972
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,961
Nothing is real.

973
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,927
See this?

974
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,184
Look at that.

975
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,279
No matter
how many times I kill it...

976
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,399
ah, there.

977
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,656
Oh, yeah.
See this? See?

978
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:56,917
Another one. Okay.

979
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:02,547
I've been doing this
all day long.

980
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,674
Look at that bastard.

981
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,177
You son of a bitch.

982
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,087
Fuck. Another one.

983
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,015
God damn it.

984
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:20,357
If I let it crawl on my body,
there's only one.

985
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:24,152
The second I kill it,

986
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,530
another one shows up.

987
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:33,071
- ( Voice whispers ) The girl.
- ( winces )

988
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,409
I know, okay?
I know what you want!

989
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,451
(voice whispering )
We want the girl.

990
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:42,121
- You can't have her.
- We can make you do it.

991
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,415
- You can't have her.
- Someone else.

992
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,380
- Someone else.
- Okay. Okay.

993
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:51,046
I'll do it. I'll do it.

994
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:52,886
But you can't have Ellie.

995
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,800
You hear me?

996
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,344
You can't have Ellie.

(voice whispering )
Kill her. Now. Kill her.

1002
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,284
Kill her. Kill her.

1003
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:01,120
- ( Groans )
- Kill her!

1004
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,838
We want you to kill her.

1005

( Growling )

1006
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:22,813
Kill.

1007
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:24,814
Kill him.

1008
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,107

1010
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,832
Sorry, Ellie.

1011
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:49,498
I just... I couldn't do it.

1012
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,166
I just...

1013
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,546
I have to fucking
get some sleep.

1014
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,714
Goddamn rest.

1015
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,009
You're not going anywhere!

1016
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:02,849
Okay, we're not going anywhere.

1017
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:04,888
We're fuckin' sleeping.

1018
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,558
No, we're not going out.

1019
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

( growls )

1023
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,165
What the fuck?

1024
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:17,924
Oh, no.

1025
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,922
( Distant static hissing )

1026
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:36,275
( static hissing )

1027
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:54,923
Jordan:
Michael.

1028
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,755
- Jordan, I'm in here.
- Michael?

1029
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,554
- Michael.
- Yeah.

1030
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:04,341
Jesus Christ, what the fuck
is going on in here?

1031
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,976
Your place is a dis... Jesus.

1032
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:15,485
Key is over there.
Do you mind getting it for me?

1033
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,317
Oh, fuck.

1034
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,905
We need to get you
some serious help, all right?

1035
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:25,446
You gonna check into a facility?

1036
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,410
I'm serious, man.
If I unlock you,

1037
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,496
we are going there right now.

1038
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,038
Answer the fucking...
what am I doing?

1039
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,173
( Phone ringing )

1040
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,890
Jordan?

1041
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:50,187
( Phone continues ringing )

1042
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,111
(stops ringing )

1043
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh! Oh, fuck!

1044
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,252
There was a being

1045
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,009
inside a light and...

1046
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:25,464
I don't know
if it was an angel or...

1047
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,133
( chuckles ) God.

1048
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:34,898
It asked me if I was
prepared to move on.

1049
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:41,526
All I needed to do was let go.

1050
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:48,411
And I wanted to.

1051
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,625
But I held on because

1052
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,036
I needed to come back
and tell you

1053
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:59,456
that everything
was gonna be okay,

1054
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,624
that I'm okay.

1055
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,755
Because...

1056
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,803
the next time that it happens,

1057
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:13,140
I'm gonna let go.

1058
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:19,192
Michael, I know you have
a hard time believing...

1059
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,148
( sobbing )

1060
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,155
...but it's real.

1061
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,487
I know that now.

1062
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:31,371
I love you, Michael.

1063
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,452
I always will.

1064
