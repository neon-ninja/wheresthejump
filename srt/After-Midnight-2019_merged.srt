00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,250
[static increasing in volume]

3
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,354
Hank?

4
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,737
Hello?

5
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:15,342
[static,
radio changing stations]

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
[static continues]
- Ah!
- [laughs] Hey, you! Good?

7
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,724
[man] You know a lot of that

8
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:36,494
white noise is leftover sound
of the birth of the universe.

9
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,630
Wow.

10
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:42,902
They call it, uh, cosmic
microwave background radiation.

11
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:47,472
Man, talk about putting
lipstick on a pig.

12
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,341
- Lipstick? Like what on a what?
- [laughs]

13
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,376
Is that a thing?
Is that a saying?

14
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,312
It's a very romantic spin
on radio static.

15
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,582
It wasn't a line, I'm not,
like, feeding you a line here.

16
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,383
That's... that's science.

17
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,586
I mean, science
is beautiful and romantic,

18
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:03,123
but that's the Big Bang,
I mean that's fact.

19
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,562
What is this place, really?

20
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:10,596
It's my house.

21
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:13,666
- I live here.
- No, you don't live here.

22
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:19,872
No. No, but it's in my... it's
been in my family for, uh, ever.

23
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,575
[woman] Wait, this
is my birthday present?

24
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:26,579
[man] Not the... not the house.
It's what's inside the house.

25
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:27,713
[woman] Right, okay, all right.

26
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:29,949
[man] Oh, my God, you're gonna
be so underwhelmed now.

27
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:32,250
[woman] No, no, I'm not.
I'm relieved, actually.

28
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,188
[man] Sure.
This is gonna be so brutal.

29
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,903
Is this my birthday present?

30
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:53,304
[man] Well, yeah, it's, uh...

31
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,876
- You know, it's experiential.
- [laughs]

32
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,345
You can't...
you can't put a big red bow

33
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,883
on the kind of night
that I have in store for you.

34
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:07,620
You can't, uh, you can't
unwrap making a memory.

35
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,287
Ah, okay, I see.

36
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,691
So you drag me
through the woods

37
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,259
to the <i>Texas Chainsaw</i>
<i>Massacre</i> house,

38
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:18,831
and I'm supposed to,
what, throw myself at you?

39
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,667
Well, I mean, I got flowers.
Did you see the flowers?

40
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,536
And what was your plan?

41
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:27,606
You're gonna just kill me or
kill me and eat me afterwards?

42
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:31,544
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, you got it backwards.

43
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:33,948
I'm gonna eat you first.

44
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:46,426
[laughs]

45
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:57,270
[moaning]

46
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,397
[couch scraping]

47
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:52,057
[woman] Do you bring all
your girlfriends here?

48
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,994
[man] All my girlfriends
are still here.

49
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:57,897
I told them I'd
bring them a friend.

50
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,066
They're going to love you,
darling.

51
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,135
It's so dark in the attic.

52
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,571
No, come on.

53
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:08,607
I haven't
brought anybody here.

54
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:11,376
Do you know anybody else
in fuckin' Barlow

55
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,878
that would've walked
through that grove?

56
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,517
- No. [laughs]
- No. Just you, though.

57
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,821
Just you.

58
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,489
- That's very sweet.
- Hm.

59
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,794
I hope you brought some wine
to go with that cheese.

60
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:32,698
- Peanut Noir?
- Yeah.

61
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,401
- That's from Georgia.
- Oh, Georgia.

62
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,338
Where they make
all the best wines.

63
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,074
It worked.

64
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:45,010
Oh, wait. Do, uh, do your, um,

65
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,781
the swirly, sniffy,
something-something...

66
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:51,050
- On the peanut wine?
- Yeah, but it's not...

67
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:53,018
I told you it
wasn't actually peanuts.

68
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,089
Okay. All right.

69
00:05:57,892 --> 00:06:01,861
- It's fruit-forward.
- Sure.

70
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:05,698
- I smelled grapes.
- Naturally.

71
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,201
- Yeah. Like grape jelly.
- Grapes.

72
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:12,137
Hints of peanut shells.

73
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,906
It's a peanut butter
and jelly wine.

74
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,174
I knew you were gonna do that.

75
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:17,910
You're such a fucking snob.
You're such a snob!

76
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:22,884
- Is it really that bad?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:26,886
I think the jar
really opens it up.

78
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,854
[laughs]

79
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:34,161
It may just be the moment,
but I think it's pretty great.

80
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:38,030
Well, this is good,

81
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:40,065
'cause the people
at the peanut wine place,

82
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,967
they talked me into buying
a whole case of this shit.

83
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:42,768
No!

84
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,970
Oh, yeah! They were
selling it hard.

85
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,606
You've got like 11
more bottles of this.

86
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,710
Drink up. So drink up.

87
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:54,782
What is this?

88
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:58,717
- "For Julie."
- Hey, wait. Wait, what is this?

89
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,920
- Hey, what is it?
- Who the fuck is Julie?

90
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:02,788
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, let me see that.

91
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,791
- Wait.
- That... that's...

92
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,660
That's been in there
for like ten years.

93
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:13,565
I'm sorry, is this a mixtape
for another girl on my birthday?

94
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,234
- Like eighth grade.
- Is that what this is? Wow.

95
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:17,603
- You are not playing that!
- I am!

96
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:20,272
You absolutely will not. Nope.
You are not playing that.

97
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,741
I will take the whole
fucking thing down.

98
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:28,149
- Come on.
- This is truly experiential.

99
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,474
[yawns]

100
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,491
[groans]

101
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:30,111
[spits]

102
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:32,913
[sniffs]

103
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:15,754
Darby!

104
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:19,825
[clicks tongue]

105
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,927
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

106
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:25,566
[clicks tongue]

107
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,803
Where you at, girl?

108
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:34,241
[upbeat music plays]

109
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:41,647
[man] Okay. You can
open your eyes now.

110
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:46,418
- Hey, hey, hey!
- [laughs]

111
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,921
It's a kitten! [laughs]

112
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:52,858
You have a balloon
attached to you. Aw!

113
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,661
- I found him like that.
- With this balloon attached?

114
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:58,430
- Yeah.
- Do you want this off of you?

115
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:03,001
You're a mess.
You're a mess, kitten.

116
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:06,238
Do you like birthday gifts you
have to care for for 20 years?

117
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,307
[laughs] Do they
live 20 years?

118
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:10,976
Ah...

119
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:14,246
Wow, it's gonna
outlast our relationship.

120
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:17,883
- [laughs]
- Fuck. Oh, sleepy baby.

121
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- He's just as lazy as you are.
- [laughs]
Should probably
get that thing off him
before he floats away.
[horn honks]

122
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,832
Fuck you!

123
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,428
<i>Hey, this is Abby.</i>

124
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,931
<i>I'm not around right now,
so leave a message.</i>

125
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,734
- [beeping]
- Hey, baby, it's me.

126
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:14,740
Um, listen, the mail's really
piling up here, okay?

127
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,376
A bunch of bills and shit,
and I don't know what's paid

128
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:18,578
or what's been paid, you know,

129
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,815
you're the one that usually
handles all that shit, so...

130
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,921
I got a bunch
of birthday cards too.

131
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,257
Listen, baby.
If you want outta this thing,

132
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,359
you're gonna have to talk
to me sooner or later, okay?

133
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:40,167
You can't just disappear.
All right?

134
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,137
Also, this is gonna sound crazy,
I know,

135
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:48,407
but ever since you left
some kinda...

136
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:52,545
...thing's been comin'
outta the woods every night.

137
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:56,549
Scratchin' on the door,
tryin' get in the house.

138
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:58,850
And I know you're probably
just rollin' your eyes,

139
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:02,087
thinkin' it's just this thing
or that thing, but it's not.

140
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:07,893
Okay? I know everything
in these woods.

141
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,964
This is, uh...

142
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,566
I don't know.

143
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:18,138
I don't know, so, just, uh,
give a call, please, would you?

144
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:21,509
I love you.

145
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:43,128
<i>Hey, this is Abby.</i>

146
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,464
<i>I'm not around right now,
so leave a message.</i>

147
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:46,566
[beeping]

148
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:50,335
Hey, yeah, also I think
that monster ate your cat.

149
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,306
[phone slams]

150
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:06,285
[officer] A-ha.

151
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:09,454
How we doin', Hank?

152
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:14,026
- You see what he did to my door?
- Blew a hole in it?

153
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:17,296
What? No! Not a...

154
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:20,500
No. This shit!

155
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:23,503
Not the hole.

156
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:26,138
Yeah, that's a black bear, Hank.

157
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,408
Oh, for God's sake,
it's not a black bear, Shane.

158
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,612
Well, I think that makes
the most sense, don't it?

159
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:36,616
No, actually, I don't think
that makes any sense, Shane,

160
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:39,951
that a black bear would walk
past all that fuckin' garbage?

161
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,654
And all this fuckin' cat food

162
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:44,456
just to come scratchin'
at my door?

163
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,426
No. Black bear'd eat
its own shit

164
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:49,629
just to have
somethin' in its mouth.

165
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:51,231
You know that.

166
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,067
You wanna tell me what
happened with that truck

167
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,670
down the road this mornin'?

168
00:13:57,672 --> 00:14:00,939
- Oh.
- He said you fired at him, Hank.

169
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,175
Yeah, well,
he damn near ran me over.

170
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:05,277

It's my birthday tomorrow.

Abby, of course I know that.

We need to get
the house in order.

- Everybody's coming over.
- No.

Abby, we can't have
people over right now.

Why not?

548
00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:00,098

comes every night.

- Come on, Hank.
- Abby, what? What?

550
00:50:02,737 --> 00:50:05,170
The monster?

551
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:10,175
Yes, fine. You want me
to put a name on it?

00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:11,644
- Yeah, it's a monster.
- Okay.

00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:14,081
She didn't get hit
by a car, Abby.

He has a name, by the way.

It's Valentine.

It's supposed
to be good luck.

- Fucking Wade.

He said the Indians said it.

If it shows up at all.

00:52:16,938 --> 00:52:19,538
I thought you said
it comes every night.

I'm serious.

It's wine.

I don't know, you tell me.
Do your, um...

Do your little swirly
sniff test thing.

595
00:53:57,705 --> 00:53:59,471
Yeah.

596
00:53:59,473 --> 00:54:01,809
Figured.

597
00:54:03,644 --> 00:54:08,814
You go down there and see
your old boyfriend? Huh?

598
00:54:08,816 --> 00:54:10,783
The old fast-talking
city boy who got you

599
00:54:10,785 --> 00:54:14,687
into all this fancy wine shit
in the first place?

600
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:17,757
That right?

601
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:19,457
Yeah, of course that's
what you'd think.

602
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:21,696
What am I supposed to think?

603
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:24,597
I don't know, Hank.

604
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:29,036
That I went to my reunion,
like I told you.

605
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,871
That I begged you
to come to.

606
00:54:31,873 --> 00:54:34,405
But you said you didn't
want to drive all that way

607
00:54:34,407 --> 00:54:38,711
just to put on a tie
and stare up people's noses.

608
00:54:38,713 --> 00:54:40,913
Well, it's 'cause
they're snobs.

609
00:54:40,915 --> 00:54:42,950
Yeah, I got it.

610
00:54:45,853 --> 00:54:52,024
[sighs] So you
didn't see him then?

611
00:54:52,026 --> 00:54:53,995
Is that what you're saying?

612
00:54:55,797 --> 00:54:58,065
No, I did see him.

613
00:55:03,671 --> 00:55:06,639
He was at the reunion
with his wife.

614
00:55:06,641 --> 00:55:10,410
And they left early
to go get their kids.

615
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,583
That's not really
the point, Hank.

616
00:55:17,752 --> 00:55:21,889
Okay. Okay.

617
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:27,960
Well, that explains
about nine hours.

618
00:55:27,962 --> 00:55:32,033
What about the other four weeks
you were gone? Hm?

619
00:55:35,402 --> 00:55:39,874
- [cocking gun repeatedly]
- Stop that.

620
00:55:45,146 --> 00:55:46,979
Did you know I'm the only
member of my family

621
00:55:46,981 --> 00:55:51,517
that's been on a plane?

622
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:53,386
Okay.

623
00:55:54,722 --> 00:55:56,789
All right, Abby.
What is the point?

624
00:55:56,791 --> 00:56:00,493
Barlow is enough for them.
That's the point.

625
00:56:01,596 --> 00:56:03,898
But it's not enough for me.

626
00:56:06,801 --> 00:56:10,468
I need art and culture.

627
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:12,872
And food that isn't brown

628
00:56:12,874 --> 00:56:17,812
and music that
isn't all banjos.

629
00:56:22,617 --> 00:56:25,751
You know, while I was gone,

630
00:56:25,753 --> 00:56:27,755
I had sushi...

631
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:31,857
...and curry and Cuban food

632
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:37,162
and... tamales

633
00:56:37,164 --> 00:56:38,998
from a guy on a bike.

634
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,803
And I saw a jazz band
play on the street

635
00:56:44,805 --> 00:56:47,172
and I drank wines
that I couldn't even pronounce.

636
00:56:47,174 --> 00:56:50,676
And I went to a museum
and I went to a baseball game.

637
00:56:50,678 --> 00:56:52,580
And...

638
00:56:53,781 --> 00:56:57,516
...that was all
in just one city.

639
00:56:57,518 --> 00:57:01,486
That was just Miami,
and just one month.

640
00:57:01,488 --> 00:57:04,158
Four hours
from our front porch.

641
00:57:07,795 --> 00:57:10,729
I spent the last month

642
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:14,969
trying to run my business
without my partner.

643
00:57:16,971 --> 00:57:19,972
Trying to keep our dirty
laundry from

644
00:57:19,974 --> 00:57:22,675
getting aired all over town.

645
00:57:22,677 --> 00:57:27,913
Thinking I was losing my
fucking mind and my best friend.

646
00:57:27,915 --> 00:57:31,752
Wondering if I was
ever gonna see you again.

647
00:57:33,888 --> 00:57:37,058
But hey, tamales.

648
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,593
I'm glad you had
such a good time.

649
00:57:41,595 --> 00:57:44,697
I am sorry
about all of that.

650
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:46,767
Good.

651
00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:51,103
- I did want to call.
- Hm.

652
00:57:51,105 --> 00:57:55,074
But I knew if I did that you'd
just convince me to come back,

653
00:57:55,076 --> 00:57:58,944
or I'd...
I'd get so mad at you

654
00:57:58,946 --> 00:58:03,048
that I would never
come home at all, so...

655
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:06,952
I figured I'd just have
to figure it out for myself.

656
00:58:06,954 --> 00:58:11,192
Well, did you?

657
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:21,235
You know when I came home
after school that summer?

658
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:27,139
I was just gonna
save some money,

659
00:58:27,141 --> 00:58:32,711
see my parents,
and that was it.

660
00:58:32,713 --> 00:58:35,047
I never intended
to stay here.

661
00:58:35,049 --> 00:58:37,349
Well, why did you, Abby?

662
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:40,753
For Christ sake,
why'd you stay?

663
00:58:40,755 --> 00:58:43,024
Because of you, Hank.

664
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:46,258
Because of you,
you wooed me,

665
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:50,297
and you swept me off my feet
and I fucking fell for it.

666
00:58:51,932 --> 00:58:55,202
Goddamn it, you used
to look at me like I was...

667
00:58:56,737 --> 00:59:00,305
You used to look at me like...

668
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:03,110
...you couldn't believe
that I existed.

669
00:59:04,779 --> 00:59:08,147
Like you couldn't
believe your luck. You know?

670
00:59:08,149 --> 00:59:12,086
And now, you hardly
look at me at all.

671
00:59:13,954 --> 00:59:16,057
Look at me, Hank.

672
00:59:18,092 --> 00:59:20,959
I see you,

673
00:59:20,961 --> 00:59:24,096
cutting eyes at other girls
all the time.

674
00:59:24,098 --> 00:59:29,935
- Oh, come on.
- I'm not crazy.

675
00:59:29,937 --> 00:59:31,270
I don't think everything's
gonna be all

676
00:59:31,272 --> 00:59:33,739
spontaneous
and new forever.

677
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:37,645
But I know you,
and I know you're a hunter.

678
00:59:39,847 --> 00:59:43,649
Maybe it was all about
the pursuit all those years ago,

679
00:59:43,651 --> 00:59:46,887
and now you're just looking
for something else to chase.

680
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:55,260
And now it's been ten years,

681
00:59:55,262 --> 00:59:57,965
and I wake up and...

682
00:59:59,233 --> 01:00:02,868
...I'm a 33-year-old

683
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:06,872
unmarried, childless
bar manager

684
01:00:06,874 --> 01:00:10,945
living in the only place that
I really ever wanted to leave.

685
01:00:13,814 --> 01:00:18,450
And I think maybe you're
looking around

686
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:23,288
to see if there's
something else you can chase.

687
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,824
And I'm thinking about all
those things that I gave up

688
01:00:25,826 --> 01:00:28,395
just for a spot
on your wall.

689
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:38,372
Everyone I know
is married.

690
01:00:40,107 --> 01:00:42,343
They all have kids.

691
01:00:45,279 --> 01:00:48,315
And I have to hear it
all the time, you know.

692
01:00:50,184 --> 01:00:52,951
"What are you two doing?

693
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:55,689
What's he waiting for?"

694
01:00:57,825 --> 01:00:59,024
I used to think that was
just some

695
01:00:59,026 --> 01:01:01,093
small town bullshit
I didn't care about.

696
01:01:01,095 --> 01:01:06,901
You know? Getting married,
having a whole litter of kids.

697
01:01:10,237 --> 01:01:14,273
I don't know, Hank.
What are we doing?

698
01:01:14,275 --> 01:01:18,379
- [laughs]
- What are you waiting for?

699
01:01:20,981 --> 01:01:22,850
Because if you're waiting
for me to look like

700
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:26,519
Jane again...

701
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:27,554
Oh!

702
01:01:27,556 --> 01:01:30,255
You know 20-something
years old, stars in my eyes,

703
01:01:30,257 --> 01:01:33,091
or if you're just looking for
some other dumb doe to chase,

704
01:01:33,093 --> 01:01:34,527
I really wish you
would tell me.

705
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:37,865
Because it would make things
a whole lot easier.

706
01:01:41,268 --> 01:01:44,138
You have everything
you want here.

707
01:01:46,006 --> 01:01:49,775
You have me,
you have the bar,

708
01:01:49,777 --> 01:01:53,180
you have Wade,
you have your hunting buddies.

709
01:01:55,082 --> 01:01:58,817
You have all these woods
and this big fucking house,

710
01:01:58,819 --> 01:02:01,355
this falling-apart house.

711
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:09,494
But what if I had gone
back to the city, you know,

712
01:02:09,496 --> 01:02:13,167
all those years ago,
and you had come with me?

713
01:02:14,368 --> 01:02:17,236
And we'd been
living in, like,

714
01:02:17,238 --> 01:02:21,775
a one-bedroom walk-up
all these years, you know?

715
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:29,549
You could hear
our neighbors above us,

716
01:02:29,551 --> 01:02:32,286
the traffic outside.

717
01:02:35,356 --> 01:02:37,222
You didn't any
of that stuff

718
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:40,861
and you couldn't wander into
the woods any time you wanted.

719
01:02:44,566 --> 01:02:47,502
You didn't have any of the
things that made you you, or

720
01:02:49,837 --> 01:02:51,905
gave you purpose.

721
01:02:57,579 --> 01:02:59,547
Would I be enough for you?

722
01:03:02,316 --> 01:03:04,184
I don't think I would.

723
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:08,621
Baby.

724
01:03:08,623 --> 01:03:11,492
Hey, look.

725
01:03:18,332 --> 01:03:20,234
Look at that.

726
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:28,340
Now I'm a 34-year-old...

727
01:03:28,342 --> 01:03:32,277
...unmarried, childless

728
01:03:32,279 --> 01:03:35,550
bar manager that
lives in the sticks.

729
01:03:41,255 --> 01:03:43,357
Thirty-four.

730
01:03:47,529 --> 01:03:51,265
You remember where we were
tonight ten years ago?

731
01:03:55,603 --> 01:03:58,070
Yeah.

732
01:03:58,072 --> 01:04:01,141
Uh-huh. Right here.

733
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,012
Right in this room.

734
01:04:10,084 --> 01:04:11,283
Sometimes it feels like

735
01:04:11,285 --> 01:04:13,187
we've lived our
whole lives in this room.

736
01:04:22,296 --> 01:04:24,532
I don't think
your monster is coming.

737
01:04:30,037 --> 01:04:33,440
[footsteps climbing stairs]

738
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:54,960
- "For Julie?"
- Wait, what is it?

739
01:04:54,962 --> 01:04:55,828
Who the fuck is Julie?

740
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:58,063
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me see that.

741
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:03,034
[laughs] No way! Listen,
this... this is incredible.

742
01:05:03,036 --> 01:05:05,538
I mean, this is a very
romantic birthday.

743
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:08,674
Oh, yeah, talk about putting
lipstick on a fucking pig.

744
01:05:08,676 --> 01:05:14,146
But this tape, which is probably
full of horribly embarrassing,

745
01:05:14,148 --> 01:05:17,315
very dated,
super emotional songs

746
01:05:17,317 --> 01:05:19,117
that you put on a tape
for another girl.

747
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:20,520
Oh, no, just one song.

748
01:05:20,522 --> 01:05:22,187
I'm sorry,
there's one song on here?

749
01:05:22,189 --> 01:05:23,355
Yeah, you know, you
put one song and

750
01:05:23,357 --> 01:05:24,423
you repeat it
over and over again.

751
01:05:24,425 --> 01:05:25,658
No, I don't know this.

752
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:28,093
- So you don't have to rewind.
- You do it over and over?

753
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:30,730
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, so this tape

754
01:05:30,732 --> 01:05:34,366
is full of one song,
over and over,

755
01:05:34,368 --> 01:05:37,068
for another girl that is not me

756
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:40,372
but it somehow made its way
here on my birthday.

757
01:05:40,374 --> 01:05:44,544
This gift,
you can't put a bow on it.

758
01:05:44,546 --> 01:05:48,781
- Oh, don't pull that shit.
- You can't unwrap this tape.

759
01:05:48,783 --> 01:05:51,049
I just said that to you,
come on.

760
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:55,588
This is truly experiential.

761
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:59,293
- Just play the fucking tape.
- I'm gonna play the tape.

762
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:04,062

[laughs] Love you!

01:07:03,558 --> 01:07:07,158
Okay, you guys have
to promise not to laugh.

781
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,494
This is my first attempt.

782
01:07:09,496 --> 01:07:12,330
- Oh, I know what that is.
- Jesus Christ, what is that?

783
01:07:12,332 --> 01:07:15,367
- Take one and pass it down.
- Is that pond water?

784
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:20,773
[laughs] I call it Sauvignon
Brun, because it's... brown.

785
01:07:20,775 --> 01:07:24,777
It looks more like
Sauvignon Bluhh!

786
01:07:24,779 --> 01:07:26,512
- Hey, be nice.
- I'm sorry...

787
01:07:26,514 --> 01:07:28,548
You made this?
Abby, you made this?

788
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,615
Yeah.

789
01:07:29,617 --> 01:07:33,318
So you like stomped on grapes
with your dirty feet.

790
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:37,289
- Is that why it's brown?
- Uh, no. It just...

791
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:39,659
I didn't seal it right
so it oxidized,

792
01:07:39,661 --> 01:07:42,193
you know how like
an apple goes brown?

793
01:07:42,195 --> 01:07:44,296
- [Wade] That means it's rotten.
- Shut up, baby.

794
01:07:44,298 --> 01:07:46,799
I'm not trying to be negative.
I'm just curious.

795
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:51,171
Does anyone know
the proper way to taste wine?

796
01:07:52,205 --> 01:07:56,308
See. Swirl.

797
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,078
Sniff.

798
01:07:59,547 --> 01:08:03,183
- Sip and savor.
- That's right.

799
01:08:05,352 --> 01:08:07,553
- You guys remember Jonestown?
- [laughter]

800
01:08:07,555 --> 01:08:11,222
- I think about it all the time.
- Did we just do a pact?

801
01:08:11,224 --> 01:08:13,793
[Wade] Oh, man, we didn't even
do any community outreach.

802
01:08:13,795 --> 01:08:17,329
- [laughter]
- This is so much fun, guys.

803
01:08:17,331 --> 01:08:19,834
I don't even remember the last
time I actually got drunk.

804
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:25,203
I do. I think it was like
two glasses of wine ago.

805
01:08:25,205 --> 01:08:27,673
Ha-ha. [laughs]

806
01:08:27,675 --> 01:08:29,542
No, well, mama got the nuggets

807
01:08:29,544 --> 01:08:31,644
and she told us to live it up
a little bit.

808
01:08:31,646 --> 01:08:35,447
You... you-you. We're staying
up to the crack of 12:30.

809
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:37,415
- [laughter]
- Whoa!

810
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:39,852
- Party animals.
- Yeah.

811
01:08:39,854 --> 01:08:40,853
Speak for yourself.

812
01:08:40,855 --> 01:08:42,755
[Hank] I may have three
glasses of wine tonight.

813
01:08:42,757 --> 01:08:45,758
- Whoa!
- So, uh, Hank.

814
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,562
Is your monster
stopping by tonight?

815
01:08:49,564 --> 01:08:51,764
Shane.

816
01:08:51,766 --> 01:08:54,434
- Come on, man.
- What? Everybody knows.

817
01:08:55,837 --> 01:08:57,469
Oh, come on.

818
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,771
There's a goddamn
elephant in the room

819
01:08:58,773 --> 01:09:00,906
and no one
wants to talk about it.

820
01:09:00,908 --> 01:09:04,242
It wasn't an elephant.

821
01:09:04,244 --> 01:09:08,346
- It was a panther.
- [laughter]

822
01:09:08,348 --> 01:09:11,817
All right,
I do have one question.

823
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:18,658
Uh... has anyone here
seen a UFO?

824
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:21,261
- Yes.
- I did once.

825
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:25,631
See? Now, Pam.

826
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:28,534
You are sure it
was an alien spacecraft?

827
01:09:28,536 --> 01:09:32,337
It couldn't have been a plane,
a helicopter, a weather balloon?

828
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:34,573
It wasn't a weather balloon.
No.

829
01:09:34,575 --> 01:09:38,577
Do you have any idea how vast
the universe is?

830
01:09:38,579 --> 01:09:43,448
I do, it's like...
like nine football fields wide.

831
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:47,485
And if you are smart enough to
travel billions of light years,

832
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:49,689
why the fuck would you
come to Barlow?

833
01:09:49,691 --> 01:09:51,757
- I mean, that's a good point.
- You're not wrong.

834
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:53,993
- You're not wrong on that one.
- I am not wrong.

835
01:09:53,995 --> 01:09:57,462
- Because I am a police officer.
- You're a police officer?

836
01:09:57,464 --> 01:10:00,733
Did you guys know...
did you know that?

837
01:10:00,735 --> 01:10:01,466
I had heard, yeah.

838
01:10:01,468 --> 01:10:04,904
[Shane] And as
a police officer,

839
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:08,306
it is my job to use logic
and evidence

840
01:10:08,308 --> 01:10:11,544
and the powers of deduction
to figure things out.

841
01:10:11,546 --> 01:10:12,545
And that is why, Pam,

842
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:16,916
a zig-zagging light
in the sky ain't a UFO,

843
01:10:16,918 --> 01:10:20,786
a glob of dust on a photo
ain't a ghost,

844
01:10:20,788 --> 01:10:23,622
and Hank, whatever the hell
has been coming around

845
01:10:23,624 --> 01:10:26,357
your house for the last month,

846
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:28,894
it ain't a goblin
or a goddamn demon

847
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:31,664
or anything else magical
or supernatural, all right?

848
01:10:31,666 --> 01:10:33,065
It's just not.

849
01:10:33,067 --> 01:10:35,034
[Abby] Shane, this is not
the time or the place.

850
01:10:35,036 --> 01:10:37,703
I'm sorry, for the last month

851
01:10:37,705 --> 01:10:40,405
Hank has been shooting at cars

852
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:42,541
and ranting and raving
