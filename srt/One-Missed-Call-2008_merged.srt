1
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:36,670
Get out of the way!

3
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,336
This way!

4
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:47,554
Saint Luke's Hospital.
I repeat, Saint Luke's Hospital.

5
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:49,692
Does anything hurt?

6
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,590
Sweetheart, is your mommy here?

7
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:54,354
Do you know where she is?

8
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,437
Really, I'm just... No.

9
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:08,634
Don't come over.

10
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:13,879
No. No, I swear
I wasn't just seeing things.

11
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,947
I mean, it could have just been a prank.

12
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:20,222
I don't know who.

13
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:25,159
No, really, I'm just gonna see you
at school tomorrow.

14
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:28,790
Thanks, Leann.

15
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:31,964
Bye.

16
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,995
Luna?

17
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:12,805
Luna?

18
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

19
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

20
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,578
Come on.
Over here.

21
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,575
Beth's a little too sane for me,
but she does throw a good party.

22
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:38,448
Yeah, so now I'm having sex
and phone sex at the same time.

23
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:40,418
Oh, man. Are you serious?

24
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:47,318
I know, but he was just so handsome.

25
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,658
And I was so nervous, you know?

26
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:53,324
<i>And I'm trying to describe
the plot of Beloved to him...</i>

27
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:55,061
...and I just started crying.

28
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:58,503
It was a perfect year, wasn't it?
I loved it.

29
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:05,343
Brian, could you get your eyes off Taylor
for two seconds and help me with this?

30
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:09,780
Unbelievable.

31
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:14,252
And before the sheets are even cold.
No wonder why Leann moved out.

32
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:18,326
I am a man. I have needs.
Is that a problem for you?

33
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,295
No. But it might be a problem for Taylor.

34
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,956
Hot. Yes, well...

35
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,331
...we can't force Taylor
to have good taste, now can we?

36
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,066
Just keep chopping.

37
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:33,642
I'll keep chopping.

38
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:44,084
You know, I can hear you analyzing me in
your head. You might as well do it out loud.

39
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:48,051
Okay, I think that
you're still messed up over Leann.

40
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:50,021
You think if you flirt with Taylor...

41
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:53,128
...maybe Leann'll get jealous
and come back to you.

42
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,124
Go back to analyzing me in your head.
I think I like that better.

43
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,833
Hey, did someone lock the door?

44
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,967
- Hey, Leann. Hi.
- Hi.

45
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:35,195
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

46
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,568
- Me too.
- Is... Is Brian home?

47
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:41,676
Yeah, he's in the kitchen,
so we should go upstairs.

48
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:47,548
How you doing?

49
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:53,882
Oh. Oh.

50
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,657
Hey, it's Leann.

51
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:58,157
Bye.

52
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,429
Okay. Just leave the alarm off. Thanks.

53
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,734
Hey.

54
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:17,809
How was it?

55
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,115
It was a funeral. It sucked.

56
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:26,750
From now on, I only go to parties
where no one gets cremated.

57
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,990
How are Shelley's parents?

58
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,755
Considering their 24-year-old daughter
drowned in the backyard pond...

59
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,189
...they're great.

60
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:38,993
And you?

61
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:42,598
I knew Shelley.
We interned at Saint Luke's together.

62
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,706
I mean, she was not crazy.

63
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:47,934
I know, but the way she was
talking at the end was pretty...

64
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,169
Yeah, that doesn't mean
she killed herself.

65
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:56,549
That's not my ringtone.

66
00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:07,959
It says it's from Shelley.

67
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,063
Who'd be calling from Shelley's phone?

68
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:17,130
That's creepy.

69
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,339
It's dated Monday, 10:17 p. m.

70
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:27,746
It's Friday. Maybe you just
set the date wrong.

71
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:42,297
Leann, what is it?

72
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:45,090
Leann?

73
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,908
<i>If you'd like to hear this message
again...</i>

74
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,511
<i>...press one.</i>

75
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:03,783
<i>Voice call received Monday,
June 12th, 10: 17 p. m.</i>

76
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:07,912
<i>I don't know,
it's the weirdest, weirdest thing.</i>

77
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,220
<i>It's like every time I
turn around, they're...</i>

78
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:17,562
<i>No! Aaah!</i>

79
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:22,230
That's your voice.

80
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:25,206
That's you.

81
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:36,108
<i>Yeah?
Yeah.</i>

82
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:37,459
<i>Cut me a break, man.</i>

83
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,388
<i>No, man, you know what the price is.
You gotta hit it right.</i>

84
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,754
<i>All right. Give me that.</i>

85
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:43,551
<i>All right, slow down, homie.</i>

86
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:46,226
Okay?

87
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:49,959
Yeah. They're real nice.

88
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:58,971
Detective Andrews. Yeah.

89
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,439
<i>A group of hikers found her.</i>

90
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:07,275
We held off on the autopsy
until you got here, detective.

91
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:13,480
Even so, your sister was out
there for more than a week.

92
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:16,958
There's really no need for you to do this.

93
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:47,385
Whew.

94
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:02,769
Oh, jeez.

95
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,739
In cases of severe and repeated
childhood abuse...

96
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:49,182
...the posttraumatic-stress model
may be valid.

97
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,878
Long-term effects may include
sexual dysfunction, amnesia...

98
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:58,618
...dissociation, even hallucinations
and multiple personalities.

99
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:00,952
The post-trauma child...

100
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,190
...faces formidable developmental tasks...

101
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:08,996
...and among these what we call
"dissociative virtuosity. "

102
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:15,701
The post-trauma child
will form primary attachments...

103
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,005
...to develop a sense of basic trust...

104
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,708
...and to preserve a sense
of hope and meaning in life.

105
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:28,120
The child will, from this experience,
attempt to...

106
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,420
...construct an explanation
of what's happened.

107
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:38,592
And these explanations may excuse
the parental negligence or abuse.

108
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:42,726
The child may blame themselves
for what has happened.

109
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,868
Look, if you come over
earlier then we can study some more.

110
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,481
Leann!

111
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,744
Hey. Do you wanna
go get some coffee?

112
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,320
No. No. I've...

113
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:04,991
...gotta get to the library.
Paper's due next week.

114
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,089
Are you okay?
You seem kind of weirded-out.

115
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,023
I haven't been sleeping too well.

116
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,035
Call me tonight.
I'll read you my paper...

117
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:18,037
...on developmental perspectives
in abuse cases. It's better than Ambien.

118
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:23,037
Okay. Bye.

119
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:27,008
Bye.

120
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,682
<i>The library will be closing in five
minutes.</i>

121
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,531
- Hey, Lee.
- Hey.

122
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:25,139
Hey, what's up?

123
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:28,367
Oh, I'm just finishing up this paper.
What are you doing?

124
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:34,977
I just got sprung from the stacks.
My brain was mushing out.

125
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,947
<i>Oh, God, I know what you mean.</i>

126
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:46,561
<i>Leann?</i>

127
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:50,196
<i>Leann? Hello?</i>

128
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:55,633
Listen, Beth, I didn't mean to ditch you
after class today. I...

129
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:07,426
<i>Leann, are you still there?</i>

130
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:12,482
I don't know how to explain it.
L... I've been...

131
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,752
<i>- I've been having some problems.
- What kind of problems?</i>

132
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:22,361
Ever since I...

133
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:23,793
Well, I don't know.

134
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:28,327
I mean, Shelley drowned,
and that was my voice screaming.

135
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:34,736
And then that bizarre phone call,
and it was dated today.

136
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:38,140
10:17 p. m.

137
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,178
- I don't...
- Where are you?

138
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:49,290
I'm at the overpass on College.

139
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:52,952
That's two minutes away.
I'll be right there.

140
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:57,656
I keep seeing things. I mean,
weird people looking at me.

141
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,758
<i>- Leann?
- I'm sorry.</i>

142
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,199
I didn't mean to panic. I've just...

143
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:05,272
I've been seeing
some really strange stuff.

144
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:10,475
I don't know,
it's the weirdest, weirdest thing.

145
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:13,342
<i>Every time I turn around, they're...</i>

146
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:25,217
Leann!

147
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,196
- No! No!
- Leann!

148
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,544
Didn't see anything?
Like I said, she threw herself off.

149
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:23,110
Please, can we go?
This is taking so long.

150
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:26,220
You're gonna have to stay here
until I get all the information.

151
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:28,219
I need you to sign this statement.

152
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,659
- Hey.
- Hey.

153
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:41,134
And then she got this strange phone call.

154
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:42,600
It's hard to believe.

155
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:46,434
Yeah, Leann told me the same thing
happened to Shelley before she drowned.

156
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:48,269
- That is so eerie.
Taylor.

157
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:53,208
What? I'm just saying what Leann said.

158
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,873
Yeah, well, maybe this isn't the time,
all right?

159
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:00,380
I heard Shelley got a phone call
from an old advisor of hers.

160
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,719
I heard that too. Only it turned out
the advisor was already dead.

161
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,621
Would you stop it?

162
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,829
Her parents are right in the other room.

163
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,602
It's like dead people call you,
but it's your own voice.

164
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,467
And then you die too.

165
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,000
Shit, Taylor, know what?

166
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:24,577
Don't try to think, all right?
It just makes you look ridiculous.

167
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,184
I heard it too.

168
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:33,946
That's it. Now I'm really creeped out.

169
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:37,751
It's shit, all right? It's total bullshit.

170
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:52,902
Brian! Brian!

171
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:55,236
What's his problem?

172
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:57,838
He had a thing for Leann.

173
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,506
Brian.

174
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:37,085
Are you okay?

175
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:38,879
What was that back there?

176
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:55,369
<i>To listen to your messages, press
one.</i>

177
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,774
<i>Voice call received
Wednesday, June 14th...</i>

178
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:02,775
<i>...12:02 p. m.</i>

179
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:06,075
<i>Damn it, I forgot. I swear if I
didn't have my head screwed on...</i>

180
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,854
The call came in two nights ago.
From Leann's phone.

181
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,858
- That was the night that she died.
- Only the call was dated Wednesday.

182
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,691
Today. 12:02 p. m.

183
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,800
I don't believe in magic, Beth.

184
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:32,903
I don't believe in anything. But ever since
I got that phone call, things have been...

185
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,210
...weird.
- Like what?

186
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,348
No, Brian, you have to tell me.

187
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:44,883
That's the exact same thing
that Leann told me right before she...

188
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:49,150
Brian?

189
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:53,784
What's wrong? Brian?

190
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,028
Look...

191
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:04,067
- What's...?
- Forget about it, okay?

192
00:22:04,272 --> 00:22:06,103
- No, Brian, don't!
- These things work...

193
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
...because they get in your head, Beth.
You're the psych lady, you know that.
If you don't think about it,
it can't hurt you.

194
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:21,221
Like I said.

195
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:41,273
Brian, your phone!

196
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,377
You forgot your phone.

197
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Damn it, I forgot. I swear if I
didn't have my head screwed on...

198
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:13,306
Let's go over this again.

199
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:17,878
Welder's acetylene tank exploded.
Your friend happened to be in the way.

200
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:20,742
Okay. And what about
Leann and the voice mails?

201
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:24,215
We checked on that. There were no
voice mails on your friends' phones.

202
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:27,287
- Either of them.
- But I heard them. Okay?

203
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:31,358
Leann got a phone call, and so did Brian,
right before they died.

204
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,219
Both of them did.

205
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:37,729
I hear it happened to Shelley too,
Shelley Baum, right before she died.

206
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:40,492
Well, thank you, Miss Raymond.

207
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,901
We'll check on that, and we'll contact you
if we need anything else.

208
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:51,373
What about the hard candies?

209
00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:54,276
Both of these kids were eating them.
My sister too.

210
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:57,009
Three people eating hard candy
in two weeks?

211
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,780
The girl's right, Mickey. There's gotta be
some kind of connection here.

212
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:03,948
You know,
I'm really sorry about your sister.

213
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:06,390
But if it was my sister...

214
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:11,758
...I'd take some personal time,
just till I was thinking right again.

215
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,199
Excuse me, Miss Raymond?

216
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:22,105
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

217
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:24,973
I'm Detective Jack Andrews. I heard
what you were saying...

218
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:27,513
...and, well, Detective Lee's a good cop...

219
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:30,116
...but she's a little short
on imagination, you know?

220
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:33,220
- What are you saying?
- I don't really know.

221
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:37,449
Except Shelley Baum interned
with my sister at Saint Luke's.

222
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:41,323
My sister Jean, she died in a fall
two days before Shelley drowned.

223
00:24:41,496 --> 00:24:44,124
Oh, I'm sorry.
But then, you see what I'm saying.

224
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,995
Everybody seems to be
linked together somehow.

225
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:49,899
Something doesn't make sense here so...

226
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,605
...if you can think of anything else,
give me a call.

227
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:09,373
You didn't get a call, did you?

228
00:26:11,753 --> 00:26:14,654
But my number was in Brian's cell.

229
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,457
I'm gonna be next.

230
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:22,787
I can feel it.

231
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:25,023
No, you don't know that, okay?

232
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,567
Because my number is in Brian's cell too.
Here.

233
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:35,105
No power, no problem.

234
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:39,376
Any dead people call...

235
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,213
...we're not home.

236
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
- Which one is it?
- Uh!

237
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:35,460
Who?

238
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:57,120
Oh, God.

239
00:27:57,892 --> 00:27:59,189
Oh, God.

240
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:01,795
This can't be happening.

241
00:28:12,574 --> 00:28:15,042
There are no batteries.

242
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,476
It says 8:32 p. m. On Friday.

243
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,211
That's two days from now.

244
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:41,664
Everything I'm seeing is there. It's real.

245
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:43,531
I'm seeing it and it's happening...

246
00:28:46,107 --> 00:28:49,634
I do not. Okay?

247
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,315
Okay, you wanna delete it? Do it yourself.

248
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,180
Look, I'm... I'm sure you'll be fine.

249
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:06,660
I wanna do mine.
- You wanna do it too? Go ahead.

250
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,324
Go on, you can all do it.

251
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:14,367
There you go.

252
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,736
- That's a...
- Wait.

253
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,569
Sorry, ladies.
It just doesn't work that way.

254
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:27,408
Right. You're telling me
that we can't cancel the service?

255
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:30,016
You don't have to cancel.
Just use up your minutes.

256
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,621
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
We don't wanna use this phone at all.

257
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:37,588
Well, the phone is yours, so you
can do whatever you want with it.

258
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:08,418
Miss Anthony?

259
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,218
- Taylor Anthony?
- Yeah.

260
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,189
Ted Summers.

261
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:17,923
<i>I'm a television producer. I work
on the program American Miracles.</i>

262
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:19,430
Oh, I've heard of that.

263
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:21,132
Yeah.

264
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:23,395
Some students called us
about what happened...

265
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,539
...and they told us
all about your problem.

266
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:30,041
- Can we help you with something? We're...
- We were very moved by your story, Taylor.

267
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:33,669
- We think we might be able to help you.
- How?

268
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:38,512
About five years ago,
my son suffered a possession.

269
00:30:42,023 --> 00:30:45,356
Yeah. It was pretty devastating
for the whole family.

270
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:49,258
So when I created my show,
I wanted to make it a point...

271
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,263
...to build an extensive resource
of people who were able...

272
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:56,961
...to deal successfully
with those evil influences like that.

273
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:59,470
What do you mean,
like, you do exorcisms?

274
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:03,509
- I think this is nonsense.
- Do you have the telephone on you, Taylor?

275
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:07,444
- What? No, we threw it away.
- Do you have the phone?

276
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:11,312
Well, it would really be helpful.
Here. Here.

277
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:13,716
Now, you show me...

278
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:16,322
...exactly what happened
when the phone call came in.

279
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:18,118
Okay, come here. Nope, nope.

280
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,818
Thank you very much.
This is ridiculous. Thank you.

281
00:31:20,995 --> 00:31:23,125
- We don't need a reality show.
- I understand...

282
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,163
...you wanna protect your friend.
- I do.

283
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,594
- I admire that.
- Thank you.

284
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:41,507
- Come on, let's go.
- Jesus.

285
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,644
Come on, come on.

286
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:48,521
Wait, we could s...

287
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,982
Hey, maybe he could help me, Beth.

288
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,324
No, Taylor, you don't need an exorcism.
Okay?

289
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,227
That guy was so full of it.

290
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:55,313
Andrews.

291
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:48,068
Miss Raymond, it is not your
imagination. The phone calls happened.

292
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:50,938
The other detective said
nobody could find the voice mails.

293
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,411
Because the other detective
didn't bother to check the phone records.

294
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:56,447
I did, and it's all right there.

295
00:33:56,617 --> 00:34:01,179
Brian was called by Leann, Leann
was called by Shelley, and Shelley...

296
00:34:01,355 --> 00:34:03,380
...was called from my sister.

297
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:07,324
All right? And all the calls came in
after the caller was already dead.

298
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:09,292
Right. Who called your sister?

299
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,797
If we could trace it to the source
and find out who started this, then...

300
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,629
I was up all night tracking it.
I'm gonna go see her now.

301
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,412
- I'll give you a call. Okay?
- Okay.

302
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:19,904
- I'm gonna come with you.
- That's not a good idea.

303
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:24,773
Yeah, it is, because these are my friends
and there's no way I'm gonna sit here.

304
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:30,112
The call my sister got
came from a nurse at an old-age home.

305
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:31,717
A woman named Marie Layton.

306
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,789
It's right up here on the right.

307
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:51,698
I wouldn't hold my breath.

308
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:55,434
Nobody's been in there for
more than two weeks now, not a soul.

309
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,601
Okay. Thank you very much.

310
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,117
You know, I'm gonna go get the super.

311
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:15,926
That could take hours.
Why don't you just break in?

312
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,725
I'm a cop.

313
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,533
I'm not.

314
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:26,630
All right, give it a shot.

315
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:36,640
Okay.

316
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,417
I was getting it.

317
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:12,545
Well, whoever Marie Layton is,
she's a hell of a housekeeper, huh?

318
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:28,596
<i>We're not... We're not...
We're not... We're not...</i>

319
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

320
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:26,348
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

321
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:35,289
I found this in the living room.

322
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,363
It must be one of those nanny cams.

323
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:42,327
To keep an eye on the children.

324
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:53,140
Okay, so judging from the angle, the
camera would have been right here.

325
00:38:57,718 --> 00:38:59,549
So where did it go?

326
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:22,866
Beth.

327
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:26,377
Look, if you don't talk to me,
I can't help you.

328
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:31,416
That noise, the inhaler. I heard it
both times, before Leann and Brian...

329
00:39:31,585 --> 00:39:34,145
Then when I looked behind me,
there was nobody there.

330
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:38,889
What the hell is happening?

331
00:39:39,326 --> 00:39:42,193
This is the morgue file of the dead
from the last month or so.

332
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:44,888
If Marie Layton died,
she did it in another city.

333
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:47,830
I don't know how you stand
looking at this stuff.

334
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:50,971
The dead ones don't really
bother me so much.

335
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,299
Now take a look at this. All right.

336
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,534
It's not a Marie Layton,
but an Ellie Layton.

337
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,309
That's the older daughter
from the photograph.

338
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,211
Yeah. It says she died of an asthma attack
in her apartment.

339
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:05,409
There's a CPS report attached too.

340
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:10,180
Child Protective Services.
Was she an abuse victim?

341
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:14,487
It says her mother was questioned
by a psychiatric nurse at...

342
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:18,026
...Saint Luke's.
- Your sister.

343
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:23,460
Wanna give me a hand with those?
Yeah, sure.

344
00:40:23,737 --> 00:40:26,501
Make sure Jesus is centered, all right?

345
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,336
Let's go, people! Let's go!

346
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,876
Hey, Gary, this is a great place.

347
00:40:32,046 --> 00:40:34,606
I have a feeling
it's gonna be a terrific show.

348
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:38,013
- How's our girl doing, huh?
Not bad.

349
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,048
This is Beth. I'm calling for Taylor.

350
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:49,390
Taylor, when you get this,
will you call me, please? Thanks.

351
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:53,294
Jean's papers. I haven't had a chance
to go through them yet...

352
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:57,700
...but she kept records of everything
in case she had to go to court...

353
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,737
...so it's gotta be in here someplace.

354
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,413
She was the baby.
I was supposed to look out for her.

355
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,077
I'm sorry.

356
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:23,921
Is this it?

357
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:31,796
It says Marie Layton...

358
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:35,169
...checked her daughter Ellie
into the hospital for an asthma attack.

359
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:38,277
And here's the little one, Laurel,
stuck a needle in her hand.

360
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:43,178
Laurel, insect bites, a burn on her leg.
Ellie, another asthma attack.

361
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,879
Okay, Laurel again,
pesticide in her eye.

362
00:41:47,054 --> 00:41:49,488
Here's another one.
Laurel ingested detergent.

363
00:41:49,657 --> 00:41:50,749
And there, another burn.

364
00:41:51,058 --> 00:41:53,925
Look at that. That's nine admissions
in April and May alone.

365
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:57,529
Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

366
00:41:57,965 --> 00:42:00,900
It's when a mother wants attention,
so she hurts her children...

367
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:02,399
...so they need medical help.

368
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,936
But there's no way
she could've given Ellie asthma.

369
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,006
No, but she could have exposed her
to something to set it off.

370
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:10,575
So Ellie has an asthma attack and dies.

371
00:42:10,744 --> 00:42:13,269
My sister starts asking questions.

372
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,041
Marie gets nervous
she's gonna be found out...

373
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:18,048
...so she takes Laurel and disappears.

374
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,053
I'm gonna go get Missing Persons on this.

375
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,857
<i>A cell phone rings
and Death is on the line.</i>

376
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,591
<i>A beautiful coed,
a ticking clock of ghostly murder.</i>

377
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,998
<i>Next, American Miracles takes you there
as a famed exorcist...</i>

378
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:40,937
<i>...tries to outrace the mysterious curse
that has already claimed two lives.</i>

379
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:46,946
Spiritual energy exists
in the same electromagnetic spectrum...

380
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:48,843
...as light or microwaves.

381
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:53,816
It's no surprise
it can travel through cellular phones.

382
00:42:54,521 --> 00:42:57,490
And it grows there, like a seed...

383
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
...where it eventually manifests as
hallucinations, spiritual disturbances...
...and finally death.
For you, darling.

384
00:43:07,568 --> 00:43:10,036
<i>Taylor, it's Beth.
Hey, Beth.</i>

385
00:43:10,204 --> 00:43:12,001
Listen, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

386
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,606
It's okay. Hold on.
We'll be there in a few minutes.

387
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:17,107
No. It's gonna work out. I know it.

388
00:43:17,278 --> 00:43:20,509
- No, Taylor, listen to me.
- There's nothing else I can do.

389
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,510
- Shit.
Okay, everybody, here we go.

390
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:27,211
Quiet, please. And four, three, two...

391
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:30,180
We cast out this unclean spirit.

392
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:34,952
Depart from here, Satan.

393
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:37,620
Depart, every demonic power...

394
00:43:37,798 --> 00:43:40,358
...every infernal adversary, every legion.

395
00:43:41,068 --> 00:43:42,399
I command you.

396
00:43:42,569 --> 00:43:44,935
I command you in the name of God...

397
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:50,065
...in the names of all his heavenly
angels, to be gone from this cell phone.

398
00:43:50,444 --> 00:43:51,638
I command you...

399
00:43:51,812 --> 00:43:56,272
...by the judge of the living and the
dead, you will leave my sister alone.

400
00:43:56,517 --> 00:43:58,712
Come out, I say, in Jesus' name!

401
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:00,415
You serpent!

402
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:02,587
Devil!

403
00:44:02,956 --> 00:44:05,151
In the name of Jesus of Nazareth...

404
00:44:05,326 --> 00:44:08,557
<i>...you will haunt this child of God
no more:</i>

405
00:44:10,497 --> 00:44:13,728
Stop tormenting my sister.
You will come out now!

406
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,267
I am calling you by name, Satan.

407
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:26,135
Come out. Show yourself!

408
00:44:31,952 --> 00:44:35,149
Depart. Depart this place. Depart.

409
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:37,414
Hey, hey, you guys, take it easy.
I'm a cop.

410
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,042
Keep rolling. Keep rolling.

411
00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:15,428
Taylor? Taylor.

412
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,094
Taylor.

413
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,516
Beth, hey. You okay? Yeah?

414
00:45:48,629 --> 00:45:50,824
Everybody back off.

415
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:56,494
Did you get that, huh?
Please tell me you got it.

416
00:45:56,737 --> 00:45:57,965
Huh?

417
00:45:58,705 --> 00:45:59,694
Ah...

418
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:23,626
Tomorrow.

419
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:26,558
You weren't there, Mickey.
You didn't see this.

420
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:29,293
- This girl needs protection.
- From what?

421
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:33,702
The ghost in her cell phone?
Tell her to call customer service.

422
00:46:34,074 --> 00:46:36,065
Jack, Mickey's got a point.

423
00:46:36,243 --> 00:46:38,768
Best use of people here
is we find the doer.

424
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:40,602
Yeah.

425
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:43,279
You're doing a great job so far.

426
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,470
<i>Voice call received...</i>

427
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:19,585
<i>Saturday, June 17th, 7:55 p. m.</i>

428
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:22,515
<i>Why?</i>

429
00:47:22,689 --> 00:47:25,852
<i>Please, just tell me why.</i>

430
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:43,537
Look, are you sure you wanna stay here?
Maybe you could stay with family instead?

431
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:47,106
- Well, my father's dead.
- Well, what about your mother?

432
00:47:50,984 --> 00:47:52,884
She and I don't talk very much.

433
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,586
- You don't have to stay.
- That's not gonna happen, okay?

434
00:47:57,758 --> 00:47:59,487
I'm not going anywhere.

435
00:48:15,742 --> 00:48:18,939
Look, this isn't over yet.

436
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,404
All right?

437
00:48:21,715 --> 00:48:26,846
- There's still time to figure this out.
- Not before 7:55 tonight.

438
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,155
- Jesus. Beth, what happened here?
- Oh!

439
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:43,468
How old were you
when you got those?

440
00:48:43,637 --> 00:48:45,832
Seven? Eight?

441
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,310
Was it your mother?

442
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,175
Did your father know?

443
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:02,886
When I call you, I expect you to come.
Do you hear me?

444
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:06,751
Do...

445
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:08,585
<i>:::you:::</i>

446
00:49:09,062 --> 00:49:10,120
...hear me?

447
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,610
My father knew.

448
00:49:34,521 --> 00:49:37,854
<i>Cry, baby, cry</i>

449
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:39,720
You're disgusting.

450
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:43,396
Go ahead. Go cry to your father.

451
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:03,278
Daddy?

452
00:50:07,954 --> 00:50:09,854
Daddy?

453
00:50:54,367 --> 00:50:55,732
Hello.

454
00:50:56,937 --> 00:50:58,802
Yeah. Okay.

455
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,139
Where?

456
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,740
All right. All right, thanks.

457
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:08,573
That was Missing Persons.
They found Laurel. She's in a foster home.

458
00:51:11,051 --> 00:51:13,178
She was at Saint Luke's
when it caught fire.

459
00:51:13,353 --> 00:51:16,015
- Wait. So she was still at the hospital?
- Yes.

460
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:20,319
She'd cut her arm, and there'd been
a report to Child Protective Services.

461
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,894
They were holding her
until she could be examined.

462
00:51:23,063 --> 00:51:25,258
What about her mother?
Do you know where she is?

463
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,266
She hasn't been seen since the fire.

464
00:51:30,203 --> 00:51:34,037
- Well, do you think we could talk to
Laurel? - You can try.

465
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:44,480
Laurel? There are some people here
to see you.

466
00:51:50,724 --> 00:51:53,522
Hi, Laurel. My name's Jack.

467
00:51:57,264 --> 00:51:59,425
It's a cute little teddy bear you got there.

468
00:52:01,802 --> 00:52:04,396
Does your teddy bear have a name?

469
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,305
She hasn't spoken since the fire.

470
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,367
Laurel, listen to me.

471
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,014
It's very important
that we find your mother.

472
00:52:15,182 --> 00:52:17,241
Do you know where she is right now?

473
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,482
Laurel, do you know
where your mother went?

474
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,017
Do you know where she is?

475
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:37,836
Do you think there's maybe
some way that you could talk to her?

476
00:52:38,004 --> 00:52:40,495
L...
You wanna try talking to her?

477
00:52:45,879 --> 00:52:50,077
What's wrong?
It's just the song the bear plays.

478
00:52:53,386 --> 00:52:54,751
Laurel, honey?

479
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,981
Honey, do you know
where your mother is?

480
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,786
Laurel?

481
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,222
Can you tell...? Look at me.

482
00:53:01,394 --> 00:53:04,420
Can you tell us? Do you know?
Can you say something?

483
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:07,256
Where is your mother? Goddamn it.

484
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,665
Oh, that was great, you know?
You really have a way with kids.

485
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:18,174
We have four hours left.
We're not gonna find her in time.

486
00:53:18,345 --> 00:53:20,336
Yes, we will.
The first thing we'll do...

487
00:53:20,513 --> 00:53:23,175
...is go downtown
and hit the department computers.

488
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:25,841
Everybody leaves a trail,
ATM machines, credit cards.

489
00:53:26,019 --> 00:53:27,932
- We'll track Marie that way.
- You do that.

490
00:53:28,088 --> 00:53:31,683
I'll find out about the fire at Saint
Luke's. Everything seems to start there.

491
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:34,520
Are you out of your mind?
Don't even think about that.

492
00:53:34,694 --> 00:53:38,653
- I'm not letting you out of my sight.
- We'll get more done if we split up, okay?

493
00:53:38,832 --> 00:53:41,357
And I'm safe until 7:55 p. m.

494
00:53:41,768 --> 00:53:43,201
All right.

495
00:53:43,603 --> 00:53:46,163
- I'll meet you at the library at 7 sharp.
- Okay.

496
00:53:46,339 --> 00:53:48,569
Here, take my other phone.

497
00:53:49,442 --> 00:53:51,410
Call me if you need me.

498
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,248
<i>Dr. Nelson, please report to
Cardiology.</i>

499
00:55:10,423 --> 00:55:12,254
<i>Dr. Nelson, please report...</i>

500
00:55:12,425 --> 00:55:15,588
- Can you ask him to hurry, please?
- I've already called him twice.

501
00:55:17,297 --> 00:55:21,165
- Miss Raymond. Mm-hm.
- Dr. Painter? I need your help.

502
00:55:22,035 --> 00:55:24,094
You were the doctor
on the children's ward...

503
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,465
...the day of the fire
at Saint Luke's Hospital?

504
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:27,663
- That's right.
- Okay.

505
00:55:27,841 --> 00:55:30,776
Do you remember a little girl,
Laurel Layton? She was 6.

506
00:55:30,944 --> 00:55:34,311
She had cut herself and you made her
stay there so the CPS could investigate.

507
00:55:37,283 --> 00:55:38,307
Shit.

508
00:55:38,485 --> 00:55:40,851
Sure, I remember her.
Her sister had just died...

509
00:55:41,021 --> 00:55:43,080
...and one of the nurses
filled out a report.

510
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,848
Right. Do you remember her mother?

511
00:55:45,025 --> 00:55:48,654
Was her mother there when the fire
started? It was during visiting hours?

512
00:55:48,828 --> 00:55:52,195
That wouldn't have made a difference.
The mother was there all the time.

513
00:56:09,149 --> 00:56:11,540
Excuse me. I'm looking for a student,
her name is Beth.

514
00:56:11,684 --> 00:56:13,510
She was supposed to be here
earlier today.

515
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,812
Where are you?

516
00:56:16,089 --> 00:56:19,081
I think Marie Layton was in the hospital
when it burned down.

517
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:21,056
I think that she might've died there.

518
00:56:21,227 --> 00:56:23,252
Impossible. All the bodies were identified.

519
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:27,025
I know, but what if they didn't find her?
What if her body's still inside?

520
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,967
<i>She was a sick woman, a child abuser.
What if her body is still inside...</i>

521
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,902
...and her spirit's there,
moving through the phones...

522
00:56:35,075 --> 00:56:36,337
...attacking people?

523
00:56:38,378 --> 00:56:40,972
Okay, all right. Where are you?
I'll come get you.

524
00:56:41,881 --> 00:56:46,477
Well, here we are, miss, Saint Luke's.

525
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,553
<i>What's left of it, anyway.</i>

526
00:56:48,692 --> 00:56:51,256
<i>Beth, no! Wait for me, all right?
I'm on my way.</i>

527
00:56:51,257 --> 00:56:53,452
Hurry, there's not much time.

528
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

529
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:19,914
Shit!

530
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

531
01:01:57,730 --> 01:02:00,631
- It's okay, it's okay.
- She's coming for me. She's coming.

532
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,768
- Okay, come on. Let's go.
- She's coming.

533
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No! No!

534
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,152
What the hell is that?

535
01:02:26,025 --> 01:02:27,390
Come on, let's go!

536
01:02:31,931 --> 01:02:34,058
- Try those doors right there.
- Uhn!

537
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

538
01:03:09,902 --> 01:03:11,802
Jack!

539
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:13,563
Jack!

540
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:38,694
No!

541
01:05:23,536 --> 01:05:25,003
Beth!

542
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

543
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

544
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,556
Please don't hurt me.

545
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,925
Please.

546
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:43,703
Forgive me.

547
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:47,374
Why?

548
01:07:48,748 --> 01:07:49,976
Why?

549
01:08:23,415 --> 01:08:25,383
She had to be the first.

550
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:29,120
She had to have my sister's number
stored in her cell phone.

551
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:33,323
I know what she was,
but I have this feeling that she...

552
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,788
...brought me here or something
to protect me.

553
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:41,731
Otherwise, why am I still alive?

554
01:08:56,482 --> 01:08:58,473
Broken pile ready to go?
Yeah.

555
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,348
Do you wanna come in?

556
01:09:36,822 --> 01:09:40,485
No, I've gotta go tell Laurel
that her mother's gone.

557
01:09:40,659 --> 01:09:43,253
Besides, you look like
you could use some rest.

558
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,521
Yeah.

559
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:49,891
Maybe you could call me sometime.

560
01:09:50,402 --> 01:09:51,664
How about tomorrow?

561
01:09:53,038 --> 01:09:54,767
Tomorrow would be nice.

562
01:11:12,785 --> 01:11:16,619
It's just as well.
I'll tell her myself in the morning.

563
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,729
What is it?
- That's Laurel's, isn't it?

564
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,733
It looks like hers.
Yeah, that's the teddy bear.

565
01:11:46,485 --> 01:11:48,077
It's a nanny cam.

566
01:11:48,354 --> 01:11:51,084
Records what goes on in the kid's room.

567
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:04,526
<i>We'll come in here...</i>

568
01:12:05,204 --> 01:12:08,139
<i>...and sit you down.</i>

569
01:12:08,774 --> 01:12:12,107
Now, be a nice little girl.

570
01:12:36,502 --> 01:12:37,935
Oh, my God.

571
01:12:46,211 --> 01:12:49,374
Now, this will only hurt a little.

572
01:12:51,417 --> 01:12:52,975
Hey, guys...

573
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:03,688
Get away from her!

574
01:13:06,065 --> 01:13:07,794
It was you.

575
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:10,366
It was you the whole time.

576
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,635
I should've known.

577
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,104
<i>Mama!</i>

578
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:26,042
<i>Please, help me! Mama!</i>

579
01:13:28,253 --> 01:13:29,481
Mama!

580
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,726
Hi, Laurel. It wasn't
your mother who hurt you.

581
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,505
It was your sister, Ellie, wasn't it?

582
01:14:52,371 --> 01:14:55,636
But she always gave me candy.

583
01:14:58,777 --> 01:15:01,974
- More stuff from the hospital?
- Yep. CSU will go through it tomorrow.

584
01:15:02,147 --> 01:15:04,172
- See you later.
- Yeah. Take it easy, man.

585
01:16:00,672 --> 01:16:04,904
<i>Voice call received Saturday, June
17th...</i>

586
01:16:05,077 --> 01:16:07,204
<i>...11 p. m.</i>

587
01:16:11,216 --> 01:16:12,649
<i>No.</i>

588
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,877
<i>No, wait. Wait, no!</i>

589
01:16:21,226 --> 01:16:23,922
<i>I... I just thought
you should hear this, Jack.</i>

590
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:25,787
<i>Jack?</i>

591
01:16:44,249 --> 01:16:46,274
Come on. Come on, pick up.

592
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:54,919
<i>Hi. No one's home, leave us a
message.</i>

593
01:16:55,927 --> 01:16:59,556
Beth, listen, okay?
Marie wasn't the first, it w...

594
01:17:03,802 --> 01:17:05,793
So, look, you were right.

595
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:09,099
Marie wasn't trying to kill you
at the hospital. She was trying...

596
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,775
<i>...to protect you, all right?</i>

597
01:17:10,776 --> 01:17:13,506
<i>She was trying to
keep her daughter away from you.</i>

598
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:17,913
Call me.

599
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

600
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:04,982
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

601
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:06,852
Look, it wasn't Marie, all right?

602
01:19:07,025 --> 01:19:09,808
The whole time it was Ellie.
She made the very first phone call.

603
01:19:11,797 --> 01:19:13,560
What's that?

604
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:34,948
No. No, wait. No!

605
01:19:37,122 --> 01:19:39,716
No!

606
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:15,420
Aah!
