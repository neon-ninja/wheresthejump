1
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:13,230
My god!

2
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:22,152
My god!

3
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,635
No!

4
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,091
Shit.

5
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:09,610
Come on, come
on, come on, come on.

6
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:12,463
Come on.

7
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:13,943
Shit.

8
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:14,465
Shit.

9
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,119
Come on.

10
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:17,077
OK.

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
What the?

12
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:22,472
Come on.

13
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:28,871
Thank god.

14
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:29,393
OK.

15
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:30,829
Chuck.

16
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:33,310
Chuck.

17
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:57,594
Shit.

18
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:01,425
Rings of Saturn.

19
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:02,513
Chuck!

20
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:03,340
Sam?

21
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:04,820
What the hell?

22
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:05,690
The phone has been ringing
for like two hours.

23
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:06,952
And I'm working.

24
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:08,606
Yeah, answering
the phone is working.

25
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,000
Chill out, Mr. I'm
Going Off the Grid for a While.

26
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:12,741
What, you lasted like two days?

27
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:15,700
Yeah, well, things haven't
worked out quite as I planned.

28
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:18,312
Being responsible for
an entire summer camp,

29
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,052
what could possibly go wrong?

30
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,706
You have no idea.

31
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,144
No, actually, you might
have the exact idea, which

32
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,494
is why I'm calling you,
'cause everything started out

33
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:29,236
so great, and now there's
this crazed killer

34
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,279
roaming the campground.

35
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:34,241
Wait, really?

36
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:35,981
Yes, Chuck, really.

37
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:39,115
Everyone is dead,
or almost everyone.

38
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,377
Whoa.

39
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:42,205
Damn.

40
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:45,600
I mean, that sometimes happens,
especially the camp counselors.

41
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:46,601
But I just never thought--

42
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:47,776
I know, I know.

43
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,212
It's terrible.

44
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,475
It really is terrible,
and I'm really scared.

45
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,216
So I thought maybe
you can help me

46
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,177
out, give me some king of advice
so I'm not, you know, dying.

47
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,482
OK.

48
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:00,528
Yeah, well, first
of all, your phone

49
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,225
seems to be working fine.

50
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,661
Wouldn't you rather
call the cops?

51
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:04,532
I did.

52
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:05,402
I called the sheriff.

53
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:06,403
I left a voicemail.

54
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:07,839
Wait, a voicemail?

55
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:08,840
Yeah, a voicemail.

56
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,146
I mean, he's 76.

57
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,756
He doesn't really
work nights anymore,

58
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,064
and-- and given that and the
town being 25 miles away,

59
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:17,893
I mean, I don't think anyone's
getting here before I'm dead.

60
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:19,764
How far off the
grid did you go?

61
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:20,939
Far.

62
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,419
25 miles.

63
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:24,204
Gotcha.

64
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:28,164
All right, well-- well, first,
I got to ask how many so far.

65
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,253
What-- what do you mean?

66
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:31,123
Like, body count.

67
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:31,950
How many dead?

68
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:34,214
I don't know.

69
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,084
I don't know, you know.

70
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,433
I'm a little flustered.

71
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:37,932
Counting's not, like,
my thing right now.

72
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:39,871
How did this even start?

73
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:42,439
I'm not sure.

74
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:44,528
All I remember is that
everything started out so

75
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:46,095
great when we first got here.

76
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:17,387
No phones, no shirt.

77
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:20,085
Step right up.

78
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,957
And I designed the
logo myself this year.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,195
I think they're pretty cool.

80
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:24,327
What do you think, Carol?
Yeah?

81
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:24,873
OK.

82
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:25,569
Yeah?

83
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:26,222
It's all right.

84
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,745
Hey, Ted.

85
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,332
Hey, thank you for choosing
Clear Vista this year.

86
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:33,316
I know you had a lot of offers.

87
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,317
Steve!

88
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,318
The Kayak King.

89
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:36,450
How you doing, man?

90
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:37,929
So glad to have you back.

91
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:38,887
My pleasure, my pleasure.

92
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,583
Good to be back.

93
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:40,802
Here you go.

94
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,325
One thing, and
it's not a big deal.

95
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:46,111
It's not a big deal, but,
um, they're canoes, so--

96
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:47,287
don't even worry about it.

97
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,157
It's fine.

98
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,332
Yeah, not a big deal.

99
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:50,420
What's up, Sam?

100
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:51,291
Hey.

101
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:51,987
Drew, right?

102
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,683
Yeah.

103
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:53,380
Find you one.

104
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:54,990
There you are.

105
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:56,097
I'm totally ready to
just unplug from the world

106
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:56,774
and catch a vibe
with this place.

107
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:58,907
Beer?

108
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,778
It's really peaceful here.

109
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:01,562
Super peaceful.

110
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:02,432
That's the spirit.

111
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:03,912
You guys hear that?

112
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:16,620
Wait, wait, wait.

113
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:18,361
Imani's there?

114
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:21,146
Well, I mean, I couldn't not
hire her because she dumped me.

115
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,539
That's discrimination.

116
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,454
God.

117
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:25,760
Hi, Imani.

118
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:27,327
I don't wanna be
a whiny bitch, but--

119
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,678
Might wanna just
leave it there then.

120
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,090
- Thank you, Freddie.
- Here you go.

121
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:33,115
Thanks.

122
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:34,812
Is this unplugging necessary?

123
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:37,380
Nature is our nature.
Come on.

124
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:39,469
It's going to be a fun awesome--
- OK, whatever.

125
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:42,037
--relaxing weekend.

126
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,561
Here you go.

127
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:46,694
If you're look for other
ways to stimulate yourself,

128
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:47,956
just you let me know.

129
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,310
OK.
Here you are.

130
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,705
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Brad.

131
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:01,317
Guess I'll have to give that
harassment speech after all.

132
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,451
Look, guys, when the kids get
here, it's really hard work.

133
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:08,455
So you're going to want to
appreciate every moment.

134
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,894
Yeah.

135
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:14,286
Being in nature?

136
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:20,205
That's what you are saying.

137
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:20,945
You know?

138
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,294
Right.

139
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:23,295
- Commune with nature.
- Right.

140
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:24,209
Thank you.

141
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:26,037
That's what-- exactly.

142
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:27,778
Jamie, right?

143
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:30,142
You gotta give these kids the
best summer they've ever had.

144
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,479
Wait, hold on a second.

145
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:41,444
OK.

146
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:43,968
So of the group,
who's dead so far?

147
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:45,076
OK, I wanna
say all of them,

148
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,015
but definitely most of them.

149
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:49,626
And-- and when we say
dead, you mean killed.

150
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,845
Yeah.

151
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,977
Stabbed, mutilated,
ripped apart.

152
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,414
And now he's hunting me.

153
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,937
And you've seen him?

154
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,982
Yeah, freaky
looking dude, really scary.

155
00:06:58,026 --> 00:06:58,983
Ugly, ugly.

156
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:00,463
I mean, hideously ugly dude.

157
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:04,859
Like Freddy ugly
or Matt Cordell ugly?

158
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:08,166
Maniac Cop.

159
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,516
I'm just gonna say ugly.

160
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:10,710
And you're
sure it's a dude?

161
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:12,054
Well, isn't
it always a dude?

162
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,521
Aw, just ask Jason's mother.

163
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:16,653
Excuse me.

164
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:18,655
$26.66.

165
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,140
My god.

166
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,620
I think he's found me.

167
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,143
My god.

168
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:29,187
Chuck.

169
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:30,493
Got your Serial Slasher card?

170
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:31,537
God.

171
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:33,844
Kill.

172
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:35,759
Kill, kill.

173
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,300
Because that's
like the classic bag that you--

174
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,418
Chuck, do you hear that?

175
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,593
Hear what?

176
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:44,768
Voices, voices.

177
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,553
The store is
full of customers.

178
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:48,032
I hear tons of voices.

179
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,339
No, no, no, not them.

180
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:56,214
Gas.

181
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:59,609
I smell gasoline.

182
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:00,610
Gas?

183
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:02,133
Sam, what is going on there?

184
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:05,136
My god.

185
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,096
Shit.

186
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:09,097
Shit.
- Sam?

187
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,140
My--

188
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,013
Hello?

189
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:12,666
Sam?

190
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:13,709
My god.

191
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:58,276
Shit.

192
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
OK.

193
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:23,258
What?

194
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:24,433
Sam.

195
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:25,826
You almost gave
me a heart attack

196
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:27,175
hanging up on me like that.

197
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:29,090
You gave me a heart
attack blowing up

198
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:31,048
my phone for everyone
in this camp to hear.

199
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:34,138
Well, OK-- well, in the
spirit of offering you advice,

200
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:37,577
I'd suggest maybe
silencing your phone.

201
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,927
You don't think I already
thought to silence my--

202
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:41,798
OK, look.

203
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:43,234
I had a thought.

204
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,976
OK, you said this crazed
killer is a guy, right?

205
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,327
OK, so maybe we should talk
about the guys out there,

206
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:50,677
you know?

207
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,504
See if we can figure
out who this asshole is.

208
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:54,985
How does knowing who
it is help me not die?

209
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,335
Well, I think figuring
out what they want

210
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,989
could help you not die.

211
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,512
Smart.

212
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:02,403
Like, is it an old camper
who got teased as a kid

213
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:03,603
and is back for blood?

214
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:04,734
No.

215
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,344
Or is it a parent
who's looking

216
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:09,434
for revenge after a counselor
let their kid drown?

217
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,175
Jesus, I hope not, no.

218
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:14,744
Or does one of the counselors
have a formerly conjoined twin?

219
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,093
What movie is that from?

220
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:17,442
That could be a huge problem.

221
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:18,811
No, it's nothing
like that, Chuck, OK?

222
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,204
It's-- it's nothing
like that, I promise.

223
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:20,881
OK?

224
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,013
OK.

225
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:24,275
OK, let me think.

226
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:26,103
Um.

227
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:28,671
You mentioned
some guy named Steve.

228
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:29,585
Yeah.

229
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,719
Steve, the Kayak King.

230
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:33,762
But it's not him.

231
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,901
My god.

232
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:44,165
Steve, the Kayak King.

233
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:48,430
He's up shit's creek now, and
I'd say without a paddle, but--

234
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:49,823
Who does this?

235
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,041
What kind of psycho?

236
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:00,921
Holy shit.

237
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:01,835
Is that Ted?

238
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:02,618
It's Steve.

239
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,228
The Kayak King.

240
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:05,665
Guys, he
isn't the only one.

241
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,884
We found Bob and Carol's
bodies in the kitchen.

242
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:08,972
Ted and Alice are missing.

243
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,017
So is Drew.

244
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,148
Who's Drew?

245
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:12,541
from the city.

246
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:13,411
Missing.

247
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:14,630
Not necessarily dead.

248
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,631
So you're an optimist.

249
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,676
Wait.

250
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:17,938
What if one of them did this?

251
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:20,331
This is insane.

252
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,376
We have to do something.

253
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,552
Sam, what do we do?

254
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:26,381
What?

255
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,252
Well, we all gotta--

256
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:29,427
OK, we all need to--

257
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,041
We all just need to--

258
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:35,651
we really gotta--

259
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,784
Put an end to this
bullshit, get our cell

260
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:40,787
phones and call the police.

261
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,443
What the hell?

262
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:46,836
No.

263
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,185
No, no, no, no.

264
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:49,380
Somebody
better explain quick.

265
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:50,144
Sam, where
are the phones?

266
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,014
It's impossible.

267
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:51,711
I put them all in here.

268
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:52,755
I locked it.

269
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,819
No one knows the combo but me.

270
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:55,149
You mean your birthday?

271
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:58,065
Hey.

272
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:14,385
Come on!

273
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:16,344
What the hell's going on?

274
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,785
That's bad.

275
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,091
Right?

276
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:25,570
What now, Sam?

277
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:27,659
Are there any other
vehicles on the property?

278
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,749
No, no, this was it.

279
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:30,793
Great.

280
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,229
Looks like we're walking.

281
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:33,448
No, no, no, I--

282
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,405
I don't think
that's a good idea.

283
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,885
I mean, guys, look around.

284
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,192
There's swamp and marshland
in every direction.

285
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:39,802
A town's not for 25 miles.

286
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:40,803
OK, so we hump it.

287
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,196
We can take that.

288
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,111
Maybe when the sun
comes up, but not now.

289
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:46,069
There's snakes and
gators out there--

290
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:48,245
poisonous snakes, giant gators.

291
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:49,812
Great.

292
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:51,355
So we get sliced up by a
madman or eaten by reptiles.

293
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,467
Did you see Steve?

294
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,816
I vote reptiles.

295
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,446
There's gotta
be a third choice.

296
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,535
What if we hole up
in the cabins until morning?

297
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,649
Yeah, 'cause those old
ass cabins are super secure.

298
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:01,824
No, no, no.

299
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,280
Jamie, that's a good
idea, all right?

300
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:04,131
We can find an area, and
we can make it as safe

301
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,132
and secure as possible.

302
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:06,263
No, Sam, no.

303
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:07,438
Look, that's not enough.

304
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:08,546
I wanna take the
fight to this guy.

305
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,137
Fair enough, OK?

306
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,834
We'll-- we'll divided
into teams, OK?

307
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:14,619
Half of us on defense to make
a safe place, the other half

308
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:15,751
of us on offense.

309
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,839
We'll set up traps.

310
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,362
We'll take it to this guy.

311
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,140
Wait, wait wait.

312
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:59,055
You went patrolling by yourself?

313
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,710
Well, it's pretty logical
in the heat of the moment.

314
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:02,885
Yeah.

315
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:04,626
OK, that's fair and
all, but it also

316
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:05,932
means you get killed quicker.

317
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:07,255
Can we just
move on, please?

318
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:12,982
Come on.

319
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:15,245
I don't think
this is a good idea.

320
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,856
Why, 'cause
Sam didn't say so?

321
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:17,987
Yeah, kinda.

322
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:19,554
Look.

323
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:22,513
They're trying to fight
a maniac with toothpicks

324
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:24,864
and pots and pans.

325
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,867
All right, if I'm gonna
die, I'm gonna die trying.

326
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,606
Yeah, die running.

327
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,608
Come on, man, that's
what you're saying.

328
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:33,002
Good people don't run
away from a fight.

329
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:34,699
And guess what, Nancy?

330
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:36,721
You're not not gonna be good
for anything if you're dead.

331
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,181
Hey, what's going on, guys?

332
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:39,898
Sam already said
it's too dark out there

333
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:40,531
for us to go out.

334
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:41,315
Sam.

335
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:42,838
Right, yeah, Sam.

336
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,491
Plus, I don't wanna
just desert everyone.

337
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:44,492
Deserting?

338
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:45,493
Whoa, you guys, I told you--

339
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:46,668
We're not deserting anyone.

340
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,235
All right, you're
saving yourself.

341
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
--there's swap and
marshland in every direction,
poisonous--
You know what?
I don't have time for this.
I'm getting out of here.

342
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:02,336
Holy shit!

343
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,819
Nancy, run!

344
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:09,821
Jesus!

345
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:23,400
It was beyond traumatic.

346
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:24,880
And that's it?

347
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,099
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:27,535
Horrifying.

349
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:28,971
But why didn't he kill you?

350
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:29,711
I don't know.

351
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:30,712
You know, I--

352
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:31,582
I don't-- I just don't know.

353
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:32,409
Well, think about it.

354
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:33,758
Why?

355
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:37,762
Why-- why did he
kill Freddie or Nancy

356
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,155
or Steve or any of the others?

357
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,504
Why-- why does it even matter?

358
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:43,159
OK, here's a different
question for you.

359
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:44,552
Are you covered in blood?

360
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,293
Chuck, are you
even listening to me?

361
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,121
Just answer the question, Sam.

362
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,340
No.

363
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:53,213
Um, a little.

364
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:54,736
Why?

365
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,173
So if you were just a
witness to these murders,

366
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:59,219
then how come you're
covered in blood?

367
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:00,002
You know, I don't--

368
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,612
I just don't know.

369
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,503
I'm, helping my niece
with her creative writing

370
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:04,876
assignment.

371
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,575
Man, the crap education
kids get this days.

372
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:08,706
Whose blood is it?

373
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,838
What do you mean?

374
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,144
Well, is it your blood?

375
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:13,102
How-- how-- how would
I be able to tell?

376
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:15,583
Well, are you bleeding?

377
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:16,584
No, I don't--

378
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:17,280
I don't-- I don't think so.

379
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:18,760
No.

380
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:20,675
If you were just a
witness to these murders,

381
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:22,546
why are you covered in blood?

382
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,592
Because I was a close witness.

383
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:25,897
I mean, I was--

384
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,030
I was, like, a very
hands-on witness.

385
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:30,163
I was really, like, right there.

386
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,206
OK, what else?

387
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,257
Are you holding a
weapon of any kind?

388
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,345
Probably a sharp one?

389
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:39,389
No, no.

390
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,609
I mean, just this baseball bat.

391
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:43,393
Wait.

392
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,047
I mean, a knife.

393
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:45,874
Sort of.

394
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:46,701
Sort of knife?

395
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:47,876
Well, I don't know.

396
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,877
Would you consider
this a weapon?

397
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,487
In this context, yes.

398
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:52,228
But you could have
had it because you

399
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:53,838
were protecting yourself.

400
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:55,275
Where did you get it?

401
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:56,624
I don't know.

402
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:57,886
You really don't know?

403
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,279
No, I don't know.

404
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:00,517
I mean, I thought I was
holding a baseball bat,

405
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,847
but now I have a
really weird knife.

406
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:04,806
Weird how?

407
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,112
I don't know.

408
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:08,070
I mean, it's like
made of like jawbone,

409
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,377
like the serrations are teeth.

410
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,336
It's got like
a real sacrificial vibe.

411
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,164
And I don't know, it's
hard to place the era.

412
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:19,168
Like the knife that you
described the killer carrying?

413
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:23,477
Yes.

414
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,262
Sam.

415
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:27,220
OK.

416
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,004
Look.

417
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:34,357
I hate to ask you this, but are
you sure you're not the killer?

418
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:39,971
I can't be 100% sure.

419
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:45,673
Maybe this is like a Jacob's
Ladder kind of thing,

420
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:47,556
and I'm already dead,
and none of this is real.

421
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:49,851
Well, that's not
possible because I'm here

422
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:51,635
and I'm very much alive.

423
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,854
Damn it.

424
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:54,899
Not that, you
know, you're alive.

425
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,051
But, you know what I mean.

426
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,598
OK, look.

427
00:17:57,641 --> 00:18:00,166
I mean, you're-- you're
definitely not the killer type.

428
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,645
You know, this is just not you.

429
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:04,213
Maybe you're like out of
your mind or something.

430
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:05,432
Did somebody drug you?

431
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,129
No, I don't think so.

432
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,131
Well, and you keep
saying that the killer's

433
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:13,875
like hideously ugly, and
you are definitely not that.

434
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,703
- Aw.
- Wait.

435
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:20,534
Are you wearing a mask?

436
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:22,188
No.

437
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:23,145
Are you sure?

438
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,669
Um.

439
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:26,540
I'm pretty sure.

440
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,802
Damn.

441
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:30,457
That would've
explained everything.

442
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,155
'Cause, like, if you're
physically killing somebody

443
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,070
but that's not
really you, then this

444
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,594
could've been the case where
the consciousness of the killer

445
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:43,905
was like possessed by an
object, like an evil mask.

446
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:49,998
My god.

447
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:52,827
Kill.

448
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,220
Kill him.

449
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:57,136
Kill.

450
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,179
Um, Chuck?

451
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:03,533
Kill.

452
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:06,493
Kill him.

453
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,495
Kill, kill, kill.

454
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,018
Kill.

455
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:13,021
Kill.

456
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:51,336
My god!

457
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:56,342
My god.
- What?

458
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:05,220
I'm the killer.

459
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,134
My god.

460
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,484
What am I gonna do?

461
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:11,008
You didn't realize
you were murdering him?

462
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:12,619
Stabbing, tying him up?

463
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:14,273
No.

464
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:17,406
I just remember standing in
front of him already dead.

465
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,321
Well, what did you
think you were doing?

466
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,670
I don't know.

467
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:24,935
Talking to you now, it's
coming more into focus.

468
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:27,242
Honestly, I don't think
I was thinking anything

469
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,809
until the mask came off.

470
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:31,681
You really didn't know that
you were murdering Steve?

471
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,509
No, no.

472
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:35,424
I was staring at him like
you'd stare at anyone

473
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:38,253
you found diced up and
dead hanging from a tree.

474
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,602
It was just horrible.

475
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:41,561
But you know now that
it was you doing it.

476
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:45,042
I saw
what the mask saw.

477
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:47,088
You forcing me to
remember everything

478
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:50,526
is bringing up stuff that I
didn't even know was there.

479
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,223
It's kinda freaking me out.

480
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,616
So, yeah.

481
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,358
I'm pretty sure it was me.

482
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:59,230
I'm sorry I dragged
you into this, Chuck.

483
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:00,014
No.

484
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:01,363
Don't apologize.

485
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:03,234
You know I live for
this kind of thing.

486
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:04,758
Look.

487
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:06,518
I found some reference
books, some really old stuff

488
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:09,023
that-- that we had in the
storage room in storage,

489
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,633
stuff that never sold.

490
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:13,201
You mean stuff you stashed
away so you could keep it.

491
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:14,376
Maybe.

492
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,247
Um, anyway, I know
that we're going

493
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,902
to get to the bottom of this.

494
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:20,991
So what should I do now?

495
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:22,384
Lock myself away?

496
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:23,883
I mean, I don't want to
kill any more people.

497
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,213
Is there anyone left to kill?

498
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:26,432
Yeah.

499
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:27,824
Yeah, I mean, there's tons.

500
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:29,957
I mean, you know, I
think-- yes, I think so.

501
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,828
There are people
alive technically,

502
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:33,047
which is good, and we wanna--

503
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,701
we wanna keep them that way.

504
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:37,007
This conversation's harder
knowing that I'm the killer.

505
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:40,706
What about Imani?

506
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:44,145
Still can't believe
you invited her back.

507
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:46,408
How's that going?

508
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,454
You guys cool?

509
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:50,432
Can't we just keep talking
about me killing people?

510
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,022
Well, yeah.

511
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,304
Yeah, I mean-- well, that--
that's where I was going.

512
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:55,069
I-- I was gonna say like, if--

513
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:57,288
if she still cares about you,
you could confide in her,

514
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:59,290
and then maybe she can help you.

515
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:00,030
Yeah.

516
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:00,509
Yeah.

517
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:02,032
Um.

518
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:02,729
OK.

519
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:04,252
I just-- I'm--

520
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:06,255
I'm really not really sure
where she is right now.

521
00:23:07,821 --> 00:23:09,257
OK, I think Imani's dead.

522
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,258
Wait, what?

523
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:11,172
Why didn't you tell me that?

524
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:12,521
I don't know.

525
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:13,479
I just--

526
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:14,828
You just remembered.

527
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:15,829
Yes.

528
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,526
Damn it!

529
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:27,667
God, she was-- she
was really something.

530
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:40,593
OK, guys, well--

531
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,899
hold on.

532
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:44,727
OK, guys.

533
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:46,488
OK, I don't think-- here,
can you hold that for me

534
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:47,251
real quick?

535
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,557
It's not working.

536
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,124
Maybe try to get it
to work if you can.

537
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,081
All right, guys, well,
welcome to Camp Clear Vista.

538
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,822
My name is Steve.

539
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:54,017
Some of you know that already
'cause you're in the best cabin

540
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:54,694
ever.

541
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:55,737
My cabin, right?

542
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:02,528
This is perfect.

543
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:06,096
The camp, the kids,
the counselors.

544
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,229
Yeah, Steve's
really good with kids.

545
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:09,404
And those kayaks.

546
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,927
But these are in fact what?

547
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:11,798
Canoes.

548
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:12,799
Great, that's right.

549
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:13,800
I'm glad you guys knew that.

550
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:16,150
So camp ends on Friday.

551
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,631
What are we going to do then?
- I don't know.

552
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:22,504
You know this is just
a summer fling for me.

553
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:23,548
It's more than that.

554
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,820
What?

555
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:35,212
Come on.

556
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:35,952
Are you worried about
the kids seeing us?

557
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:36,823
No.

558
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:37,866
Have to learn sometime.

559
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:42,305
Then what?

560
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,837
I don't know.
Why can't you just relax?

561
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,664
You know?

562
00:24:51,707 --> 00:24:53,187
Have a good time.

563
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,190
And when it's all done,
you'll have a good memory.

564
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:02,022
Just enjoy it.

565
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:04,807
Now these are only
to be used to the water, OK?

566
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:06,505
It's not for hitting people, OK?

567
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:09,769
It can also be used for
air guitar or as a golf--

568
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:12,946
you know, like a, um,
club there, OK, guys?

569
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:14,643
But not for hitting,
definitely, OK?

570
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,403
And don't worry if you end up
in the water 'cause we send

571
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:18,255
a scuba diver out
there about a week ago

572
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,910
to check for alligators, and,
he hasn't come back yet,

573
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:22,999
so I think he's doing
a very thorough job.

574
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:25,654
If you see him, you
know, let us know.

575
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:26,655
You know, people were worried.

576
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:29,223
So all right.

577
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,616
Don't look like a sad puppy.

578
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,202
Why do people think I
look like a puppy dog?

579
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:33,923
'Cause you do.

580
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,969
Come here.

581
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:37,012
Come here.

582
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,279
Whoa, hey!

583
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:45,065
No.

584
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:46,588
How could you?

585
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:48,087
Everybody, we're gonna
play and laugh at Sam, OK?

586
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:49,391
He just fell in the water there.

587
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,598
Steve, save me!

588
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:58,010
That's why you wear
the life preservers.

589
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,819
That's why you wear
the life preservers.

590
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:00,862
You fell for it.

591
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:07,087
I'm gonna destroy this thing.

592
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,784
Be very careful
how you do that.

593
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:41,469
Sam.

594
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:42,601
Sam, what's going on?

595
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:48,476
I tried to burn the mask.

596
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,130
Your face is
burning, isn't it?

597
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:51,697
Yeah.

598
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,047
I was worried about that.

599
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,485
I'm afraid the thing
probably imprinted on you.

600
00:26:57,528 --> 00:27:01,097
There's plenty of instances
of that happening in here.

601
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:02,446
How do you know that?

602
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,145
Sam, please, you
called me for a reason.

603
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:07,800
Wait.

604
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,584
Shh, shh, shh.

605
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,151
Hey.

606
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:12,432
I think I saw that son of
a bitch heading this way.

607
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,763
Do we really
wanna find him?

608
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:17,723
When I catch this guy, I'm
gonna beat him till he's dead.

609
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:18,830
Then revive him
so I can chop him

610
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:20,595
up into little bitty pieces.

611
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:24,555
They're on to me.

612
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,687
They're coming after me.

613
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:26,601
Who?

614
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,907
Whoever's still alive.

615
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,449
How do they
know you're the killer?

616
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:30,581
They tried to burn the
cabin down with me in it.

617
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:31,925
That's a pretty
goddamn good clue.

618
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:33,192
This doesn't
make any sense.

619
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:34,000
Why would Sam do this?

620
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:35,262
I don't care.

621
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:36,959
I just want him dead.

622
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:38,613
What about
giving yourself up?

623
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,397
Like, explain the situation.

624
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:44,053
Maybe they can restrain you so
you don't kill anybody else.

625
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:45,098
Brad would kill me.

626
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:46,379
He'd ripped my head off, Chuck.

627
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:47,883
I'm trying to stay alive.

628
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:03,420
OK, where are you now?

629
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:04,247
Still hiding.

630
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,291
Hold on.

631
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:39,326
Yeah, OK, I think I'm--

632
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:40,370
I think I'm good for now.

633
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:40,980
OK.

634
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:41,720
OK, good.

635
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,373
All right.

636
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:47,595
So just-- just stay where you
are and-- and hunker down.

637
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:48,901
OK.

638
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:49,944
Um.

639
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:02,697
OK, I'm hunkered.

640
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,046
OK, good.

641
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,918
I think we just need
to regroup and focus.

642
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:06,701
Yeah.
Right.

643
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,833
OK.

644
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,071
And-- and
maybe we can come

645
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:11,271
up with like a
timeline of exactly

646
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:13,186
what you did with the mask on.

647
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:13,882
OK.

648
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:15,318
OK.
Yeah.

649
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,035
OK, what is your
first memory of things

650
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,670
going wrong or going weird?

651
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:22,848
OK, I remember being confused
as to why I was running.

652
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:23,979
Running.

653
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:25,023
Running where?

654
00:29:26,503 --> 00:29:28,375
Away from a dead tree.

655
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,900
Yeah.

656
00:29:31,944 --> 00:29:33,573
I-- I remember something bad
happened near a dead tree,

657
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:35,077
and--

658
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,078
What?

659
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:37,601
Shit.

660
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,429
İt's right
there, and I just--

661
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:41,083
I can't remember.

662
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,128
Shit.

663
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:43,451
OK, what do you remember?

664
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:47,523
I remember a pool.

665
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:35,094
Hey, pal.

666
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:37,052
Kill.

667
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Having a little palm
party there perving on us?

668
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:50,849
You chopped
his head in half?

669
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:51,892
Yeah.

670
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:55,418
What did you do to her?

671
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:20,966
I liked it better when
I didn't remember.

672
00:31:38,635 --> 00:31:39,810
Whoa, hey.

673
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:40,942
Kill those lights.

674
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:42,378
What is the
matter with you?

675
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:44,119
You wanna flag
everybody around

676
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:46,010
here, get them to all come in
here and get to the good stuff

677
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:47,644
before us?

678
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:49,013
Come on, they're all out
looking for that grave thing

679
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:50,430
anyway.

680
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:52,060
Yeah, which gives
us a chance to party.

681
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:53,346
So help me out?

682
00:31:57,263 --> 00:31:59,134
Yes.
Jackpot.

683
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Now all we need is--

684
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:08,229
--chocolate.

685
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:12,882
Kill.

686
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:21,113
Kill Carol.

687
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:55,843
Damn, Sam.

688
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:56,539
I know.

689
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,019
I hate myself.

690
00:32:58,063 --> 00:32:59,736
Well, is it too
obvious to ask why didn't

691
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,414
you just take the mask off?

692
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:03,111
When it's on, I don't want to.

693
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:04,243
Yeah.

694
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:05,418
Shoulda figured.

695
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,028
But this kill
was different.

696
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,812
I think it pushed
me a little too far.

697
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:13,252
I-- I-- I became aware of
myself for just a split second.

698
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,344
No.

699
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:03,867
No.

700
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:04,911
Please.

701
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:11,658
Please don't make me.

702
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:31,069
Kill.

703
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,030
Kill, kill, kill.

704
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,469
Kill Steve, the Kayak King.

705
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:45,431
Kill the Kayak King, Steve.

706
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:47,433
Steve.

707
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:50,088
Hey.

708
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,935
Just getting 'em ready
for their maiden voyage.

709
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,154
Kill Steve.

710
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:56,311
Who-- who is that?

711
00:34:56,355 --> 00:34:58,357
What are you doing here?

712
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,924
What are you wearing?

713
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:03,753
Wow.

714
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:05,494
This is so bad.

715
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:07,931
So how many do you
think you've killed?

716
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:10,586
You
know what I think?

717
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,763
This asshole should
kill himself.

718
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:16,331
How long have
you been listening?

719
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,854
Long enough.

720
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:20,335
You should choose your
friends more wisely.

721
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:23,164
Have fun being an accomplice
to murder, sweetie.

722
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,731
I'll have you
know it's a killer

723
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:28,082
mask doing it, not my friend.

724
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,302
Don't act like
that sounds so weird.

725
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:32,304
They're right, you know.

726
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:34,219
I should just kill myself.

727
00:35:34,262 --> 00:35:36,743
You found an evil
mask, and you put it on.

728
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:39,354
What in God's name did
you think would happen?

729
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:41,835
I don't need your
judgment right now, Chuck.

730
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:45,404
Can you at least remember
where you found this thing?

731
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,587
We were
scared shitless.

732
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,241
And we'd been
looking everywhere.

733
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:58,460
We even called the police.

734
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,201
When we finally
found him, his body--

735
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:02,856
or what was left of him--

736
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:05,728
his body was just lying
there limp and lifeless,

737
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:08,209
his eyes glazed over.

738
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:13,954
We realized that Brad had gotten
so drunk that he locked himself

739
00:36:13,997 --> 00:36:15,869
in his car and fell asleep.

740
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:19,960
Thank you.

741
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:20,656
Thanks, Freddie.

742
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,615
Thank you, Brad.

743
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:24,443
All right, I'm gonna--

744
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:27,010
I'm gonna tell a
different kind of story.

745
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:28,490
OK?

746
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:30,207
It's sort of, um-- sort
of like a history lesson.

747
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:33,234
It's about this camp,
and it's all true,

748
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:37,804
and it happened right
here on this very land.

749
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:40,328
So long before the French
Cajuns arrived here,

750
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:42,461
the natives lived in
harmony with the land.

751
00:36:42,504 --> 00:36:45,028
It was peaceful back then.

752
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:48,249
But when the Cajun settlers
came with their gris-gris

753
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:51,078
and their potions
and black magic,

754
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:55,604
they awoke something,
something dark, sinister.

755
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,824
And it struck with a vengeance.

756
00:36:57,867 --> 00:37:00,740
Suddenly, these Cajun settlers
started dying in the most

757
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:02,829
horrific ways, right?

758
00:37:02,872 --> 00:37:04,265
Killing each other.

759
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:05,701
Killing themselves.

760
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:08,269
It went on this
way for many months

761
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:12,752
till finally a, ,
a medicine man,

762
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:16,843
was able to trap the dark
spirit in an old red oak tree

763
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:19,628
somewhere in these woods.

764
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:23,328
And there it stayed
locked up for 100 years,

765
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:26,418
and people were safe.

766
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:32,424
Until one winter day when a
woodcarver came upon the tree

767
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:35,557
right here in these
woods and he chopped

768
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:37,559
the tree down to get his wood.

769
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:41,781
But something happened
'cause this woodcarver,

770
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:45,306
his trade was furniture,
children's toys.

771
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:49,963
But that day, something
compelled him to carve a mask.

772
00:37:50,006 --> 00:37:53,619
And this mask was unlike--

773
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:55,751
unlike any other.

774
00:37:55,795 --> 00:38:00,626
It had dark empty eyes
that drank in the light,

775
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:02,584
sucking the goodness
out of the world.

776
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,760
Do we have
to listen to this?

777
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:08,895
Aw, somebody's spooked.

778
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:10,418
Guys, guys, listen.

779
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:12,942
I'd-- I'd stop, but this
isn't just some story.

780
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:14,506
This is the real
history of this place.

781
00:38:18,774 --> 00:38:19,969
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

782
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:21,255
Wait a minute.

783
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,953
So you're saying
you knew all along

784
00:38:23,997 --> 00:38:26,739
that your family's campground
had this creepy history

785
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:28,958
with the evil mask?

786
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:31,352
Not to sound like
a broken record,

787
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:33,354
but why the hell did
you put that mask on?

788
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:35,530
Would you just
listen to me please?

789
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:41,580
So finally one night when the
woodcarver couldn't sleep,

790
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:44,887
every night he'd
have nightmares.

791
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:47,542
Said to his wife he
was hearing voices.

792
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:50,632
Ever since he carved this
mask, he'd been restless.

793
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:52,591
So he took it out
into the woods,

794
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:54,810
and he goes to destroy the mask.

795
00:38:54,854 --> 00:38:58,031
And as he raises his ax,
again something compels

796
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:02,252
him instead to put the mask on.

797
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:05,299
And although this man was
known as the kindest person

798
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,085
in his town, that
night he killed

799
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:12,001
everybody in the village,
including his own family.

800
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:19,400
There was one survivor.

801
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:21,576
It was a young woman who
happened to be out butchering

802
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,405
chickens, and when
she came back,

803
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:28,061
she used the butcher's ax
to kill the woodcarver.

804
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:29,410
Wow.

805
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:30,324
Goosebumps.

806
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,978
OK.

807
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:34,328
But I'm telling you, ever since
this land has been plagued

808
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,765
with all kinds of
weird accidents,

809
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:38,463
unexplained deaths, murders.

810
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm sure you guys
have heard stories.
But to this day, the evil
mask has never been found.

811
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:49,561
Steve!

812
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:50,953
Come on, Steve.

813
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:54,348
You know we don't play
those crazy games.

814
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,436
Crazy white boy Steve.

815
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,481
Come on now.

816
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:57,917
Yeah, so, guys, in--

817
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,460
in all seriousness, the
murders were horrendous.

818
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:02,138
So, you know, be
careful out there.

819
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:05,011
And it's also true that
the mask was never found,

820
00:40:05,054 --> 00:40:06,795
and the legend has
it that it's buried

821
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:11,278
at the woodcarver's grave, which
is somewhere on this property.

822
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:13,759
OK.

823
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:15,151
Let me get this right.

824
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:19,460
We have a creepy mask
and a cursed grave.

825
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:20,766
Two words, guys.

826
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,942
Treasure hunt.

827
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:23,943
Right?

828
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:24,813
Come on.

829
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:25,510
No, no, no, guys.

830
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:26,554
Come on.

831
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:28,121
We're gonna make this fun, Sam.

832
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:29,490
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

833
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:31,013
Stop being
little boys, seriously.

834
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:32,493
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait wait, wait.

835
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,475
You guys, that's not
the point of the story.

836
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,869
Sam, I don't think
your story had a point anyway.

837
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:38,174
It's a cool legend.

838
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:38,827
Guys.

839
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:40,481
Yeah.

840
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:41,177
He was just trying to
scare us with that story.

841
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:42,221
Come on, baby.

842
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,358
Hi.

843
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:49,751
Hi.

844
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:52,232
Shall we go?

845
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:54,016
What are you talking about?

846
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,802
Your parents have owned this
land for how many years now?

847
00:40:56,845 --> 00:41:00,501
Like you don't know
where the grave is.

848
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:03,504
I-- I mean, maybe.

849
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:05,712
I guess I'll meet you there.

850
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:11,904
No, um--

851
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:17,083
I mean, I'm sorry.

852
00:41:17,126 --> 00:41:19,738
You know, I'm responsible
for these wackos, so.

853
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:20,782
I understand.

854
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:21,522
Look, I got the fire.

855
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:23,002
I'm cozy.

856
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:23,959
I'll just stay here.

857
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:25,003
You go on.

858
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:31,619
Hey, guys?

859
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:32,663
Drew.

860
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,583
Hey, Drew.

861
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:42,847
Come on.

862
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:47,505
This is not funny, guys.

863
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,099
Drew?

864
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:22,408
Drew?

865
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Guess who?

866
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:41,733
God!

867
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:42,472
Drew.

868
00:42:42,516 --> 00:42:44,649
Gotcha.

869
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:46,607
Not funny.

870
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:48,391
Come on.

871
00:42:48,435 --> 00:42:50,611
This place is
like creepy cool.

872
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:52,787
So you didn't
actually have any idea

873
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:54,702
what this was, did you?

874
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:58,010
I didn't need to, did I?

875
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,014
OK, you got me.

876
00:43:02,057 --> 00:43:03,057
Can we go now?

877
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,801
Drew, come on.

878
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:10,152
Let's go back to the
others, all right?

879
00:43:10,196 --> 00:43:11,893
Do you know if
this says anything?

880
00:43:11,937 --> 00:43:14,635
Yeah, it says,
"Congratulations, you found me.

881
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:16,028
Now get the hell out of here."

882
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:19,640
You can go brag
to everyone else.

883
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:21,555
Come on, Drew.

884
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,991
Seriously, I've
been here a bunch.

885
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:24,297
It's not a big deal.

886
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,341
There's a tree.

887
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:26,665
There's a saddle, the headstone.

888
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:30,128
What is this?

889
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:35,874
That's the ground.

890
00:43:40,748 --> 00:43:41,488
Good one.

891
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:44,143
What a surprise.

892
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:44,970
So scared.

893
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:46,013
My god.

894
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,453
Hey, hey, don't touch that.

895
00:43:50,497 --> 00:43:52,020
Drew.

896
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:53,389
Dude, I know the whole
first night initiation thing.

897
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:54,825
I've been going to
camps since I was eight.

898
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:57,025
No, this is not that, OK?

899
00:43:57,069 --> 00:43:58,026
Trust me, please.

900
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,637
Can we just get out of here?

901
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,859
Please, just put that
down, and let's go, OK?

902
00:44:04,903 --> 00:44:05,903
Drew, come on.

903
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:12,432
Hey, don't put that on.

904
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:14,739
OK.

905
00:44:14,782 --> 00:44:15,740
God.

906
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:16,783
You put it on.

907
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:19,831
Die.

908
00:44:19,874 --> 00:44:21,354
Kill, kill, kill.

909
00:44:21,397 --> 00:44:23,312
Kill.

910
00:44:23,356 --> 00:44:24,749
Sam.

911
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:26,707
Sam.

912
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,751
Sam.

913
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,543
Sam.

914
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:45,421
It's yours.

915
00:44:45,465 --> 00:44:46,465
Sam.

916
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:51,384
The knife is yours.

917
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:52,427
Take it.

918
00:44:55,388 --> 00:44:59,522
I thank you.

919
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:01,916
Sam, this
isn't funny anymore.

920
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,960
Kill.

921
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:06,442
Kill, kill.

922
00:45:06,486 --> 00:45:08,923
Sam.

923
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:11,404
Sam.

924
00:45:31,424 --> 00:45:34,079
OK, look, with
all this craziness,

925
00:45:34,122 --> 00:45:38,126
it just goes to show you that
history loves repeating itself.

926
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,955
You know, Sleepaway
Camp and killer masks.

927
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:45,743
It's like fries and gravy,
peanut butter and bananas, Mets

928
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:47,919
fans and perpetual suffering.

929
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:50,486
Things that go together
even though they shouldn't.

930
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:51,792
Right.

931
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:52,924
All right.

932
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:54,534
Let me see if I
got this straight.

933
00:45:54,577 --> 00:45:57,929
Drew was your first kill,
and then the skinny dipper.

934
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:01,584
Then what?

935
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:05,632
- And then--

936
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:09,244
Steve, the Kayak King.

937
00:46:09,288 --> 00:46:10,288
Did I forget anyone?

938
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:13,988
Right.

939
00:46:14,032 --> 00:46:16,686
So without knowing
about the others,

940
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,558
you've killed eight so far.

941
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:19,820
Nine.

942
00:46:19,864 --> 00:46:21,213
Imani.

943
00:46:23,432 --> 00:46:25,086
OK, so nine.

944
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,958
This is so bad.

945
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:28,829
None of them deserve this.

946
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:33,442
Well, I think it's
only gonna get worse.

947
00:46:33,486 --> 00:46:36,141
I think you're
probably gonna die.

948
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:37,185
Wow.

949
00:46:37,229 --> 00:46:38,578
Sorry, Sam.

950
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:41,276
It's just that's how
these things seem to go.

951
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,410
On the bright side, though,
in a lot of these cases,

952
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:46,673
the killer comes back
in a couple of years.

953
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:48,501
You know, lightning
strikes their grave,

954
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:52,635
and then they're
back from the dead.

955
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:53,680
That's not funny.

956
00:46:53,723 --> 00:46:56,944
You know it could happen.

957
00:46:56,988 --> 00:46:59,642
There's got to be something
that we're missing.

958
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:03,168
There's just got to be.

959
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:05,866
How did Imani die?

960
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:09,783
OK, after we found
Steve hanging from that tree,

961
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,195
that's when we all
started making traps.

962
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:14,179
We figured we had
to catch the killer.

963
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:15,222
Catch me.

964
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:23,101
Holy shit, Jamie.

965
00:47:23,144 --> 00:47:24,232
Did you just do that?

966
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:25,233
Good job.

967
00:47:25,277 --> 00:47:27,148
You guys dig a lot of holes?

968
00:47:27,192 --> 00:47:28,889
It's not quite
the arts and crafts

969
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:31,172
project I was hoping for, but
we're getting through this.

970
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:34,460
You know, to be honest, I
liked last summer way better.

971
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:35,503
Yeah, me too.

972
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:42,642
My girlfriend and I are going
to culinary school together.

973
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:47,429
That's the plan anyway
if, I get in.

974
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:49,040
What are you gonna do?

975
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:51,433
Marry a rich guy.

976
00:47:51,477 --> 00:47:52,477
Smart.

977
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,106
Well, that works.

978
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,716
OK.

979
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,717
So we checked the perimeter.

980
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:15,936
Everything's clear.

981
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,174
Yeah, there's no
one in that patch,

982
00:48:17,198 --> 00:48:18,558
so we should be
safe for now, guys.

983
00:48:18,591 --> 00:48:20,003
Guys, what
was all that noise?

984
00:48:20,027 --> 00:48:22,247
We were just
testing the alert system.

985
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,465
OK, good.

986
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:24,902
Sam, what do we do now?

987
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:28,688
Well, we've
got a secure perimeter.

988
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:30,187
OK, that doesn't
answer our question.

989
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:31,343
What do we do now?

990
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:33,954
Well, I think now we--

991
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:35,398
you know, we just
circle the wagons.

992
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:39,457
You know, circle the wagons.

993
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:40,743
Stay inside the safe zone.

994
00:48:40,787 --> 00:48:42,136
There's a killer out there.

995
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,853
We circle the wagons,
we'll be sitting ducks.

996
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:45,037
We need to go after this guy.

997
00:48:46,706 --> 00:48:47,185
OK.

998
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:48,577
Yeah.

999
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:51,058
Yeah, let's-- let's
kick it up a notch, man.

1000
00:48:51,102 --> 00:48:55,454
Hey, why don't we combine
offense and defense?

1001
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:56,977
Yeah.

1002
00:48:57,021 --> 00:48:59,327
Um, I'll-- I'll run outside
the perimeter, right?

1003
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:00,111
I'll run around.

1004
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:01,155
I'll be like bait.

1005
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:02,548
OK, and then the killer sees me.

1006
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:04,942
I'll run back, trip the alarm.

1007
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:06,421
He'll come in.

1008
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:08,902
You guys converge on him,
force him into the pit.

1009
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,426
- What?
- Y'all seen Jamie's pit?

1010
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,361
What if you end up
coming from the other direction?

1011
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:15,561
There's no alarm there.

1012
00:49:15,604 --> 00:49:16,997
How many pots and pans?

1013
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:19,217
I can go 100 feet that
way and be a lookout.

1014
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:19,913
By yourself?

1015
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,567
Jamie.

1016
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,742
I'll go with her.

1017
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:23,937
Yeah, that
makes more sense.

1018
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:24,787
- Yes.
- Let's just do this.

1019
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:26,354
Jamie, I got you.

1020
00:49:43,328 --> 00:49:45,048
Kill, kill, kill, kill.

1021
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:52,205
Sam.

1022
00:49:56,645 --> 00:49:59,039
Sam.

1023
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:00,736
Wear it.

1024
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,696
Wear it.

1025
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:04,739
Do it, do it, do it.

1026
00:50:11,747 --> 00:50:13,706
Kill.

1027
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:15,142
Kill, kill, kill.

1028
00:50:15,186 --> 00:50:16,186
Sam.

1029
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:27,633
Kill.

1030
00:50:27,676 --> 00:50:30,114
No.

1031
00:50:32,638 --> 00:50:34,596
Sam.

1032
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,597
Now.

1033
00:50:35,641 --> 00:50:36,598
Kill, kill.

1034
00:50:36,642 --> 00:50:37,642
Kill.

1035
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:43,016
I don't think
this is a good idea.

1036
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,495
Why, 'cause
Sam didn't said so?

1037
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,173
Yeah, kinda.

1038
00:50:46,217 --> 00:50:47,740
Well,
guess what, Nancy?

1039
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:49,631
You're not gonna be good
for anything if you're dead.

1040
00:50:49,655 --> 00:50:51,372
Sam already said
it's too dangerous out there

1041
00:50:51,396 --> 00:50:53,006
to go out in the dark.

1042
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,636
Plus, I don't wanna
just desert everybody.

1043
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,357
You're not deserting anyone.

1044
00:50:56,401 --> 00:50:57,880
Right, you're saving yourself.

1045
00:50:57,924 --> 00:50:59,143
I don't have time for this.

1046
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:00,318
I'm getting out of here.

1047
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:56,287
Hey, asshole.

1048
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,897
Come over here.
Come on.

1049
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,035
Come on, let's play a game.

1050
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:17,395
Little bit closer.

1051
00:52:17,438 --> 00:52:18,438
Come on.

1052
00:52:23,662 --> 00:52:26,578
There you go.

1053
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:44,464
Kill, kill.

1054
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:56,173
Hey, assface!

1055
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:57,957
This way, baby, come on!

1056
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,438
Die.

1057
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:02,396
Die.

1058
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,833
Kill her now.

1059
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:08,837
Kill Imani now,
now, now, now, now.

1060
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:21,284
Kill her.

1061
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,605
Imani!

1062
00:53:49,574 --> 00:53:50,574
Go, go, go, go, go!

1063
00:54:25,566 --> 00:54:27,046
My god.

1064
00:54:27,089 --> 00:54:29,004
My god!

1065
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:31,442
My god!

1066
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:32,965
My god!

1067
00:54:34,445 --> 00:54:35,924
My god!

1068
00:54:35,968 --> 00:54:36,968
My god!

1069
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,242
Rings of Saturn.

1070
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,201
Chuck!

1071
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:55,553
This is a really
bad development, Sam.

1072
00:54:55,596 --> 00:54:57,487
You know, I really thought
I had a chance of getting

1073
00:54:57,511 --> 00:54:59,383
back together with Imani.

1074
00:54:59,426 --> 00:55:00,601
What?

1075
00:55:00,645 --> 00:55:02,516
Yeah, it's bad
that Imani is dead,

1076
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,606
but, no, I'm talking about
the other girl, Jamie.

1077
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:06,955
Jamie?

1078
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:07,999
Hold on, hold on.

1079
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,353
What's bad about Jamie?

1080
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:15,157
Well, the fact
that she's still alive.

1081
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:17,836
I mean, it's good for
her, but it's bad for you.

1082
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:19,707
In what sense
is that bad for me?

1083
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:22,623
In the sense that
she's gonna kill you.

1084
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,016
Jamie?

1085
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,757
What, are you crazy?

1086
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,160
Your friend's got
serious relationship problems.

1087
00:55:28,194 --> 00:55:29,848
Hey, it's after midnight.

1088
00:55:29,891 --> 00:55:33,155
How come you haven't
turned into a pumpkin?

1089
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:35,114
Come on.
I have to lock up.

1090
00:55:35,157 --> 00:55:36,376
OK, what time do you open?

1091
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,987
Yeah, yeah, goodbye.

1092
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:41,207
Jamie's the last person
I have to worry about.

1093
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,730
Precisely.

1094
00:55:42,774 --> 00:55:44,273
No, no, no, no, Chuck,
you don't understand.

1095
00:55:44,297 --> 00:55:47,082
You know, Jamie-- Jamie's
like the sweetest girl

1096
00:55:47,126 --> 00:55:48,693
on the planet.

1097
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:50,410
I-- I mean, you should see
her dig, but she's really,

1098
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:51,260
really gentle.

1099
00:55:51,304 --> 00:55:52,610
She loves to paint.

1100
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:54,196
I mean, she wanted to
run arts and crafts.

1101
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,500
Haven't
you learn anything

1102
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:56,962
from the thousands
of hours we've

1103
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:58,746
spent watching horror movies?

1104
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:02,794
If you're the killer,
Jaime's your final girl.

1105
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:04,361
Final--

1106
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:06,164
Laurie in Halloween,
Nancy from Nightmare,

1107
00:56:06,188 --> 00:56:07,102
Sally from Chainsaw.

1108
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:08,756
It happens all the time.

1109
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,411
It's-- it's always
the purest soul.

1110
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:14,283
It's always the last
girl to survive.

1111
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:16,938
Listen, Chuck, I take back
whatever I said about you

1112
00:56:16,982 --> 00:56:18,462
over explaining stuff.

1113
00:56:18,505 --> 00:56:20,986
Well, exposition
is my middle name.

1114
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:25,294
So let's say I kill Jaime.

1115
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:26,208
My god.

1116
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:28,428
I-- I can't kill Jaime.

1117
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:29,429
What am I talking about?

1118
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:31,039
This is crazy.

1119
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:32,365
Well, Is there anyone
left that could kill you,

1120
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,607
anyone at all?

1121
00:56:33,651 --> 00:56:37,350
Whoever lit
that cabin on fire.

1122
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,960
That-- that could be Brad.

1123
00:56:39,004 --> 00:56:40,788
You know, it probably
was Brad, and I don't

1124
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:42,399
remember killing him either.

1125
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,792
Well, as soon as you put
that mask on, he's toast.

1126
00:56:44,836 --> 00:56:46,141
Bloody toast.

1127
00:56:46,185 --> 00:56:47,534
That's insane.

1128
00:56:47,578 --> 00:56:49,623
You're-- you're saying
if I put on this mask,

1129
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:53,975
I can kill some muscle bound
meat head like Brad, but a--

1130
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:56,456
a sweet girl like
Jaime's gonna kill me?

1131
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,763
Yep.

1132
00:56:58,806 --> 00:57:00,634
Wow.

1133
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:05,291
There he is.

1134
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:07,336
All right.

1135
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,687
So let me get this straight.

1136
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,341
Only one person walks
out of here alive,

1137
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:13,691
and that's the most pure person.

1138
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:15,388
Always.

1139
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,563
And that's never the killer?

1140
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:17,564
No.

1141
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:18,913
And not just in the movies.

1142
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:20,480
Do you remember
Boondock Butcher?

1143
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:21,805
No, Chuck, I don't remember
the Boondock Butcher.

1144
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:23,241
A kindergarten
teacher put a stop

1145
00:57:23,265 --> 00:57:24,982
to his killing spree,
and she must've weighed

1146
00:57:25,006 --> 00:57:27,400
like 98 pounds soaking wet.

1147
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,446
Captain Howdy, 'member?

1148
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:32,536
Yeah, a nun crushed him
with the steeple bells.

1149
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:35,930
Meaty Face--
guess who stopped him.

1150
00:57:35,974 --> 00:57:37,671
A paraplegic.

1151
00:57:37,715 --> 00:57:41,632
Rolled over him again and again
with spiked wheelchair tires.

1152
00:57:41,675 --> 00:57:43,329
Must've taken like two hours.

1153
00:57:43,372 --> 00:57:44,741
All right, all right, enough.
Thank you.

1154
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:45,374
I get it.

1155
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:46,332
I get it.

1156
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,072
OK, Jamie's gonna kill me.

1157
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:47,768
That's great.

1158
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:48,552
That's awesome.

1159
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:49,901
Sorry, Sam.

1160
00:57:49,944 --> 00:57:51,816
Of all the possible
parallel universes,

1161
00:57:51,859 --> 00:57:53,379
you've got to live
and die in this one.

1162
00:57:58,126 --> 00:57:59,345
What are you gonna do?

1163
00:57:59,388 --> 00:58:00,388
Kill the bastard.

1164
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:31,551
No, I don't wanna kill Brad.

1165
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:34,119
I wish this goddamn
mask would kill me.

1166
00:58:48,786 --> 00:58:49,613
Wait a minute.

1167
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:50,656
I have an idea, Chuck.

1168
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:54,487
Yeah.

1169
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,444
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1170
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:56,528
I have a pretty good idea.

1171
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:34,483
Sam, what's going on?

1172
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,920
It was a bad idea, Chuck.

1173
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:36,790
It didn't work.

1174
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,009
It didn't work.

1175
00:59:38,052 --> 00:59:42,622
Die you bastard!

1176
00:59:49,498 --> 00:59:50,804
What the hell?

1177
00:59:54,373 --> 00:59:56,288
Sam.

1178
00:59:56,331 --> 00:59:57,724
Kill.

1179
00:59:57,768 --> 00:59:59,378
Goddamn.

1180
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:01,641
Damn you.

1181
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:04,426
Sam.

1182
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:05,863
My god.

1183
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:07,734
Damn you.

1184
01:00:07,778 --> 01:00:09,388
Damn you.

1185
01:00:09,431 --> 01:00:10,084
Fight it, Sam.

1186
01:00:10,128 --> 01:00:11,128
Fight it.

1187
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,438
Kill.

1188
01:00:16,482 --> 01:00:17,918
Kill.

1189
01:00:17,962 --> 01:00:18,702
Kill.

1190
01:00:18,745 --> 01:00:20,442
Sam, come closer.

1191
01:00:20,486 --> 01:00:21,443
You can do it.

1192
01:00:21,487 --> 01:00:22,923
Closer.

1193
01:00:22,967 --> 01:00:25,186
No.

1194
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,318
No, goddamn you.

1195
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:27,449
I won't put you on.

1196
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:33,368
God, no, no.

1197
01:00:33,412 --> 01:00:34,412
No.

1198
01:00:39,374 --> 01:00:40,374
No, no.

1199
01:00:50,342 --> 01:00:51,342
You bastard.

1200
01:00:59,438 --> 01:01:00,438
Sam.

1201
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:07,707
Die, asshole.

1202
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:09,187
No.

1203
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,230
No.

1204
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,601
No!

1205
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:41,567
Sam.

1206
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:42,829
Sam?

1207
01:01:42,873 --> 01:01:44,570
Kill, kill, kill.

1208
01:01:44,613 --> 01:01:45,613
Sam.

1209
01:01:47,616 --> 01:01:48,616
Sam.

1210
01:01:52,056 --> 01:01:53,056
Sam.

1211
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,093
It's OK.

1212
01:02:29,136 --> 01:02:29,789
It's just me.

1213
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,095
It's just me.

1214
01:02:32,183 --> 01:02:33,401
I thought you were dead.

1215
01:02:33,445 --> 01:02:35,795
Yeah, I know.

1216
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,102
But, hey, I figured if
he thought I was dead,

1217
01:02:38,145 --> 01:02:39,209
I'd be off his list, right?

1218
01:02:39,233 --> 01:02:40,887
Give me an advantage.

1219
01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:42,691
You-- you think he murdered
all of us here intentionally?

1220
01:02:42,715 --> 01:02:44,717
Well, I don't know,
and I don't care.

1221
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,458
Well, how do we
get out of here?

1222
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:47,522
There's only one way.

1223
01:02:47,546 --> 01:02:49,156
Over Sam's dead body.

1224
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,679
Come on.

1225
01:03:03,518 --> 01:03:04,563
Hey.

1226
01:03:04,606 --> 01:03:07,609
There's stuff in
here we can use.

1227
01:03:07,653 --> 01:03:09,307
Look.

1228
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,830
You can do some
damage with these.

1229
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:12,834
You'll be dead
before you get close enough.

1230
01:03:18,403 --> 01:03:19,839
If I got a good
swing with this--

1231
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:20,963
You'll be dead if you miss.

1232
01:03:33,113 --> 01:03:36,900
This is way too heavy.

1233
01:03:38,945 --> 01:03:41,861
Close the door.

1234
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,825
Samuel Justin Wescott, don't
you even think about it!

1235
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:53,786
Stop it, man!

1236
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,830
Come on!

1237
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:04,144
OK.

1238
01:04:04,188 --> 01:04:07,104
OK.

1239
01:04:07,147 --> 01:04:08,105
No.

1240
01:04:08,148 --> 01:04:09,584
OK.

1241
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:10,803
My god.
My god.

1242
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:11,717
My god.
My god.

1243
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,718
No, no, no, no.

1244
01:04:12,761 --> 01:04:14,720
God, what do we do?

1245
01:04:14,763 --> 01:04:15,721
My god.

1246
01:04:15,764 --> 01:04:16,722
My god.

1247
01:04:16,765 --> 01:04:17,375
Hold on, look around.

1248
01:04:17,418 --> 01:04:18,202
Look around.

1249
01:04:18,245 --> 01:04:19,245
Find something.

1250
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:24,382
Think quick.

1251
01:04:24,425 --> 01:04:25,165
Imani.

1252
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:27,167
Hold on.

1253
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:28,168
What's this?

1254
01:04:28,212 --> 01:04:30,170
Wait.

1255
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:31,171
Shovel.

1256
01:04:31,215 --> 01:04:31,824
Shovel.

1257
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:32,868
OK.

1258
01:04:38,178 --> 01:04:39,136
Go, go.

1259
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:40,137
Come on.

1260
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:43,140
Let's go.

1261
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:51,104
There you are, Sam.

1262
01:04:51,148 --> 01:04:52,410
Caged, no other way out.

1263
01:04:52,453 --> 01:04:54,020
I thought you were dead.

1264
01:04:54,064 --> 01:04:55,848
And I thought
you were a nice guy,

1265
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,502
but now I want you
to rot in hell.

1266
01:04:57,545 --> 01:04:58,416
Let's go.

1267
01:04:58,459 --> 01:04:59,591
No.

1268
01:04:59,634 --> 01:05:01,201
No, no, no, no,
no, it wasn't me.

1269
01:05:01,245 --> 01:05:02,594
It was the mask.

1270
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:05,118
The mask made me do it.

1271
01:05:05,162 --> 01:05:05,989
The mask?

1272
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:07,642
Yes, yes, Jaime.

1273
01:05:07,686 --> 01:05:12,386
Jaime, I swear, I swear I
have fought with every fiber

1274
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:13,910
of my being against it.

1275
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:14,823
You're such a liar.

1276
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:15,955
No, I-- I promise.

1277
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:17,130
I've struggled!

1278
01:05:17,174 --> 01:05:19,393
You kept your phone.

1279
01:05:19,437 --> 01:05:20,438
What?

1280
01:05:20,481 --> 01:05:21,178
We had to lock our phones up.

1281
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:21,918
You kept yours.

1282
01:05:21,961 --> 01:05:22,962
It's my camp.

1283
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:24,355
I'm responsible for everyone.

1284
01:05:24,398 --> 01:05:26,115
I have to have my phone
in case of an emergency.

1285
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:28,228
It's selfish and two-faced.

1286
01:05:28,272 --> 01:05:30,970
Letting people think you're
dead is pretty damn selfish.

1287
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:31,710
Really?

1288
01:05:31,753 --> 01:05:32,363
Is that right?

1289
01:05:32,406 --> 01:05:34,278
Yeah, yeah.

1290
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:37,542
I was heartbroken enough
when you dumped me.

1291
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:38,586
OK?

1292
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,284
It wasn't just a summer fling.

1293
01:05:40,327 --> 01:05:43,417
You-- you don't think I
wouldn't care if you were dead?

1294
01:05:43,461 --> 01:05:44,592
You tried to kill me!

1295
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:45,898
I was not trying
to kill anyone!

1296
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,334
Yes, you were!

1297
01:05:47,378 --> 01:05:48,857
My god.

1298
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:50,598
Look, look, look.

1299
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:54,254
You know me better than anyone,
except maybe my friend Chuck.

1300
01:05:54,298 --> 01:05:55,821
You know I'm telling the truth.

1301
01:05:55,864 --> 01:05:59,085
I could never do these
things that I've been doing.

1302
01:05:59,129 --> 01:06:03,350
This-- this thing
makes me do them.

1303
01:06:03,394 --> 01:06:05,570
It-- it's the story
that I told you.

1304
01:06:05,613 --> 01:06:07,746
It has some awful power
when you put it on.

1305
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:11,054
Its evil takes hold of you.

1306
01:06:11,097 --> 01:06:13,012
The legend is true.

1307
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:15,536
If you knew the legend was
true, why'd you put it on?

1308
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,321
That's the thing!

1309
01:06:17,364 --> 01:06:20,977
I didn't put it on.

1310
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:22,674
Drew did.

1311
01:06:22,717 --> 01:06:23,631
Yeah.

1312
01:06:23,675 --> 01:06:25,546
Drew put it on me.

1313
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:26,460
Drew.

1314
01:06:26,504 --> 01:06:27,809
Yes.

1315
01:06:27,853 --> 01:06:29,072
Yes.

1316
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:32,684
We found it at the
woodcarver's grave.

1317
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:34,729
What were you doing with
Drew alone in a forest?

1318
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:36,427
Jesus.

1319
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:39,038
It would've been nothing if
you didn't have your dumb let's

1320
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:41,127
go on a treasure hunt idea.

1321
01:06:41,171 --> 01:06:44,043
You know, Jamie, one
could make the argument

1322
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:46,263
that this whole mess
is Imani's fault.

1323
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:46,915
My fault?

1324
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:47,959
Yes.

1325
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:50,615
I'm not the one
with the crazy knife,

1326
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:52,201
and I'm not the one who mistakes
a summer fling with something--

1327
01:06:52,225 --> 01:06:53,463
It was more than
a summer fling!

1328
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:54,662
You guys!

1329
01:06:54,706 --> 01:06:57,013
This is not the time.

1330
01:06:57,056 --> 01:06:59,972
Sam, you need to
promise no more killing.

1331
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,452
No more killing.

1332
01:07:01,495 --> 01:07:04,107
I swear.

1333
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,805
Look, I need you guys to stay
alive so I can stay alive.

1334
01:07:06,848 --> 01:07:08,328
I'm not following
your logic, Sam.

1335
01:07:08,372 --> 01:07:10,504
Look, I've been
talking to my friend Chuck,

1336
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:12,158
and she says the
way these things

1337
01:07:12,202 --> 01:07:15,727
always go is that it's the
final girl who kills the killer.

1338
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:20,123
So as long as you two
are alive, you know?

1339
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:21,211
No final girl.

1340
01:07:21,254 --> 01:07:22,864
We-- we all stay safe.

1341
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,696
Your friend must be
as crazy as you are.

1342
01:07:32,222 --> 01:07:33,179
Hold on.

1343
01:07:33,223 --> 01:07:34,311
OK.

1344
01:07:34,354 --> 01:07:36,226
Here we go.

1345
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:45,365
Sometimes she doesn't
pick up right away.

1346
01:07:54,766 --> 01:07:55,375
Sam?

1347
01:07:55,419 --> 01:07:56,681
Chuck!

1348
01:07:56,724 --> 01:07:57,377
Hey.

1349
01:07:57,421 --> 01:07:58,944
God.

1350
01:07:58,987 --> 01:07:59,814
Are you OK?

1351
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:01,164
Yes.

1352
01:08:01,207 --> 01:08:03,035
Well, no, I'm-- I'm
locked up, but that's--

1353
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,384
I'm still kicking.

1354
01:08:04,428 --> 01:08:05,733
I panicked.

1355
01:08:05,777 --> 01:08:07,605
I-- I-- I called the
sheriff by the camp.

1356
01:08:07,648 --> 01:08:08,475
Yeah?

1357
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:09,694
Left a voicemail.

1358
01:08:09,737 --> 01:08:11,478
God, he
should just retire.

1359
01:08:12,218 --> 01:08:13,393
Um, hey, Chuck.

1360
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:15,047
This is, Imani,
Sam's friend.

1361
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:16,962
Hi.

1362
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:18,224
So, Chuck, I--

1363
01:08:18,268 --> 01:08:20,008
I need you to back
me up here and tell

1364
01:08:20,052 --> 01:08:23,360
these ladies about this whole
final girl thing because I'm--

1365
01:08:23,403 --> 01:08:25,144
I'm looking pretty
crazy right now.

1366
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:26,450
Ladies?

1367
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:28,234
Jamie, she's there too?

1368
01:08:28,278 --> 01:08:30,149
Yeah, yeah, Jamie.
Jamie.

1369
01:08:30,193 --> 01:08:32,108
Chuck, Jamie, Jamie, Chuck.

1370
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:33,370
Yeah, yeah, Jamie's here.

1371
01:08:33,413 --> 01:08:35,981
Um, Jamie hit me with a shovel.

1372
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:36,808
OK.

1373
01:08:36,851 --> 01:08:38,375
OK, um, well, yeah.

1374
01:08:38,418 --> 01:08:43,684
First of all, ladies,
I know this is all insane.

1375
01:08:43,728 --> 01:08:45,208
Just bear with me for a minute.

1376
01:08:45,251 --> 01:08:49,690
But, OK, whatever you
do, do not let Sam put

1377
01:08:49,734 --> 01:08:52,606
the mask on his face again, OK?

1378
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:57,481
The mask is responsible
for all this, not Sam.

1379
01:08:57,524 --> 01:09:00,266
And, second, in
situations like this,

1380
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:04,314
in the paranormal or when
there's a lunatic on the loose

1381
01:09:04,357 --> 01:09:09,754
or whatever, there's usually
a pure and innocent girl,

1382
01:09:09,797 --> 01:09:13,975
you know, the-- the final
one alive that usually--

1383
01:09:14,019 --> 01:09:18,023
the final girl that--
that saves the day.

1384
01:09:18,066 --> 01:09:20,460
Sam.

1385
01:09:20,504 --> 01:09:21,940
Sam.

1386
01:09:21,983 --> 01:09:23,898
Kill.

1387
01:09:23,942 --> 01:09:24,421
Come on.

1388
01:09:24,464 --> 01:09:26,814
Do it.

1389
01:09:26,858 --> 01:09:29,774
And, Jamie, from
what Sam says,

1390
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:31,210
that-- that sounds like you.

1391
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:35,562
No offense, Imani.

1392
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:45,442
Guys.

1393
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:48,923
What's happening?

1394
01:09:48,967 --> 01:09:51,448
Um, Sam's
getting the mask.

1395
01:09:51,491 --> 01:09:53,798
Guys, run.

1396
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:56,235
Run!

1397
01:10:15,385 --> 01:10:17,822
Do you know
where we're going?

1398
01:10:17,865 --> 01:10:19,258
Nope.

1399
01:10:19,302 --> 01:10:20,607
I know where you're going.

1400
01:10:20,651 --> 01:10:22,348
Imani, what the
hell are you doing?

1401
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:23,871
We're not gonna
be able to stop him.

1402
01:10:23,915 --> 01:10:25,501
Well, it's not gonna
help if you turn on me.

1403
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:27,527
I'm not sure
there's much either of you

1404
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:30,182
can do to alter the
course of these events.

1405
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,836
So it goes.

1406
01:10:31,879 --> 01:10:34,360
No, Chuck, we can make
this happen any kind of way.

1407
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:36,382
And I know I'm more equipped
to kill Sam than Little

1408
01:10:36,406 --> 01:10:37,798
Miss Perfect over here.

1409
01:10:37,842 --> 01:10:40,497
OK, this isn't
a logic problem, Imani.

1410
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:44,283
No matter how strong or
smart you think you are,

1411
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:47,852
no matter how determined,
you just can't outplay this.

1412
01:10:47,895 --> 01:10:51,595
There's just no way that
you're the pure soul that

1413
01:10:51,638 --> 01:10:53,379
survives at the end of the day.

1414
01:10:53,423 --> 01:10:54,119
I'm sorry.

1415
01:10:54,162 --> 01:10:55,468
You just aren't.

1416
01:10:55,512 --> 01:10:56,991
Yeah?

1417
01:10:57,035 --> 01:10:58,317
Well, there's more to
purity than meets the eye,

1418
01:10:58,341 --> 01:11:00,256
and I know she's not
this perfect image

1419
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:01,387
she shows everybody.

1420
01:11:06,827 --> 01:11:07,827
Do you party?

1421
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:13,791
- Why?
- Drugs, alcohol, caffeine even?

1422
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:14,661
No.

1423
01:11:14,705 --> 01:11:16,141
Just face it, Imani.

1424
01:11:16,184 --> 01:11:17,360
You're not a virgin, are you?

1425
01:11:17,403 --> 01:11:18,709
That's personal.

1426
01:11:18,752 --> 01:11:20,295
Yeah, so is
life and death, baby.

1427
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,451
And it's down to me and you.

1428
01:11:21,494 --> 01:11:22,734
- So are you a virgin?
- Yes!

1429
01:11:25,977 --> 01:11:27,370
Are you happy now?

1430
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:29,023
Nope.

1431
01:11:29,067 --> 01:11:33,854
'Cause that mean Chuck was
right, and you.

1432
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:54,048
What's-- what's going on?

1433
01:11:54,092 --> 01:11:55,441
Hello?

1434
01:11:55,485 --> 01:11:56,897
Imani bought into
what you were saying.

1435
01:11:56,921 --> 01:11:58,879
What did you do?

1436
01:11:58,923 --> 01:12:00,794
I acted first.

1437
01:12:00,838 --> 01:12:02,666
OK.

1438
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:03,797
What do I do now?

1439
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:12,153
You-- you've got to kill Sam.

1440
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,377
He's right there.

1441
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:19,813
Sam?

1442
01:12:19,857 --> 01:12:20,423
Sam?

1443
01:12:20,466 --> 01:12:21,337
Hello?

1444
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,642
He's got the mask on.

1445
01:12:22,686 --> 01:12:24,209
Then you
should be running.

1446
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:25,950
No.

1447
01:12:25,993 --> 01:12:27,908
I have to end this.
Now.

1448
01:12:34,741 --> 01:12:36,047
How are you gonna do that?

1449
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:37,178
I have a shovel.

1450
01:12:37,222 --> 01:12:38,702
No.

1451
01:12:38,745 --> 01:12:40,965
No, you can't possibly
take out evil this powerful

1452
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:42,270
with a shovel.

1453
01:12:42,314 --> 01:12:43,315
I'm sorry.

1454
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,403
You're just not.

1455
01:12:44,447 --> 01:12:46,100
Then what am I supposed to do?

1456
01:12:46,144 --> 01:12:48,364
You have to meet
him on-- on the right field

1457
01:12:48,407 --> 01:12:49,234
of battle.

1458
01:12:49,277 --> 01:12:50,104
What does that mean?

1459
01:12:50,148 --> 01:12:51,845
A place of power.

1460
01:12:51,889 --> 01:12:53,020
What?

1461
01:12:53,064 --> 01:12:53,978
OK.

1462
01:12:54,021 --> 01:12:55,458
You-- you know at my work?

1463
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:58,330
The woodcarver's grave,
where Sam found the mask.

1464
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,679
Just go there.

1465
01:12:59,723 --> 01:13:01,115
I don't know where that is.

1466
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:02,334
OK.

1467
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,858
After Sam killed
Drew, he-- he--

1468
01:13:04,902 --> 01:13:07,252
he killed Ted and Allison
in a swimming pool.

1469
01:13:07,295 --> 01:13:11,256
So-- so the grave must be
around there somewhere.

1470
01:13:11,299 --> 01:13:12,299
Run!

1471
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:19,196
Kill, kill, kill.

1472
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,407
Kill, kill.

1473
01:13:38,283 --> 01:13:40,720
Kill.

1474
01:13:53,254 --> 01:13:54,254
Sam?

1475
01:13:58,695 --> 01:14:00,653
Hello?

1476
01:14:00,697 --> 01:14:02,655
Sam?

1477
01:14:02,699 --> 01:14:05,136
Sam?

1478
01:14:32,076 --> 01:14:33,512
Sam?

1479
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:36,036
Sam.

1480
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,516
Hello?

1481
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,560
Hello?

1482
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:41,999
Chuck.

1483
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:43,304
Sam?

1484
01:14:43,348 --> 01:14:45,524
I think I can
conquer this thing.

1485
01:14:45,568 --> 01:14:47,700
OK.

1486
01:14:47,744 --> 01:14:50,573
I don't have to kill Jamie.

1487
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:51,661
OK.

1488
01:14:51,704 --> 01:14:52,812
And she doesn't
have to kill me.

1489
01:14:52,836 --> 01:14:56,143
No, I know, OK.

1490
01:14:56,187 --> 01:14:58,058
I know you think
it's inevitable.

1491
01:15:00,757 --> 01:15:04,412
But I'm gonna take this mask
back to the woodcarver's grave,

1492
01:15:04,456 --> 01:15:06,371
and I'm gonna end this.

1493
01:15:06,414 --> 01:15:07,720
Sam, you know what?

1494
01:15:07,764 --> 01:15:09,306
I-- I have some more
old books in the back,

1495
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,637
like more arcane stuff.

1496
01:15:11,681 --> 01:15:14,640
Maybe I can-- I can find
a spell or something?

1497
01:15:14,684 --> 01:15:15,946
There's no time.

1498
01:15:15,989 --> 01:15:17,687
Well, can you
give me like just

1499
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:19,384
five minutes or something?

1500
01:15:19,427 --> 01:15:21,580
I'm not sure how much longer
I can hold this power off.

1501
01:15:21,604 --> 01:15:23,885
No, no, just-- just
give me like five more minutes.

1502
01:15:26,783 --> 01:15:28,219
Hello?

1503
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:29,699
Sam.

1504
01:15:29,742 --> 01:15:31,222
Hello?

1505
01:16:11,915 --> 01:16:12,915
Jamie.

1506
01:16:13,438 --> 01:16:14,439
Sam!

1507
01:16:14,482 --> 01:16:15,614
Get away from me.

1508
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:16,397
OK.

1509
01:16:16,441 --> 01:16:17,964
It's me.
No mask.

1510
01:16:18,008 --> 01:16:19,444
I don't trust you.

1511
01:16:19,487 --> 01:16:21,272
You're sick freak.

1512
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:26,930
But you have to believe me.

1513
01:16:26,973 --> 01:16:27,800
How can I?

1514
01:16:27,844 --> 01:16:29,628
See, I've got the mask.

1515
01:16:29,672 --> 01:16:30,672
But to stop it--

1516
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,027
see, I think I know
how to stop it.

1517
01:16:40,378 --> 01:16:42,075
The woodcarver's
grave is that way.

1518
01:16:44,774 --> 01:16:45,774
I'm going.

1519
01:16:48,212 --> 01:16:50,214
You don't have to come with me.

1520
01:17:04,054 --> 01:17:05,454
I'm not letting
you out of my sight.

1521
01:17:08,885 --> 01:17:09,885
OK.

1522
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:20,331
Hey.

1523
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:21,201
OK.

1524
01:17:21,245 --> 01:17:23,160
Look, all right, this--

1525
01:17:23,203 --> 01:17:27,077
this is where we found the mask.

1526
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,514
And-- and I think--

1527
01:17:29,557 --> 01:17:31,157
I think this is where
we need to bury it.

1528
01:17:34,475 --> 01:17:36,347
Now it's-- it's OK.

1529
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:38,044
Nothing's gonna happen.

1530
01:17:38,088 --> 01:17:40,786
We can end this right now.

1531
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:43,833
We can both walk out
of here together.

1532
01:17:43,876 --> 01:17:48,228
We just need to put
this in the ground.

1533
01:17:48,272 --> 01:17:51,275
I was gonna do it
myself, but I just

1534
01:17:51,318 --> 01:17:55,453
don't think I should
be near this thing

1535
01:17:55,496 --> 01:17:59,196
any longer than I have to be.

1536
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:04,549
I don't even think we should
be seeing each other anymore.

1537
01:18:04,592 --> 01:18:05,811
OK?

1538
01:18:05,855 --> 01:18:08,858
Now let's put that
shovel to good use.

1539
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:10,207
All right, all right.

1540
01:18:14,298 --> 01:18:15,298
OK.

1541
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:23,176
Thank you, Jamie.

1542
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:24,220
Thank you.

1543
01:18:26,353 --> 01:18:27,006
That's right.

1544
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:27,659
That's right.

1545
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,052
Just dig.

1546
01:18:29,095 --> 01:18:30,314
Doesn't have to be too deep.

1547
01:18:30,357 --> 01:18:32,011
You know, it's not--

1548
01:18:32,055 --> 01:18:33,621
sorry.

1549
01:18:33,665 --> 01:18:35,362
You know what you're doing.

1550
01:18:35,406 --> 01:18:37,800
You have a gift, Jamie.

1551
01:18:37,843 --> 01:18:40,150
I'm lucky to have you--

1552
01:18:40,193 --> 01:18:42,108
I'm lucky to have
you here doing this.

1553
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:58,255
Maybe don't touch
it either, right?

1554
01:18:58,298 --> 01:18:59,449
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1555
01:18:59,473 --> 01:19:02,433
Just, um-- maybe
just dump it out.

1556
01:19:02,476 --> 01:19:05,871
Just-- just just
shake it out, OK?

1557
01:19:05,915 --> 01:19:07,481
I don't even think
I should see it.

1558
01:19:07,525 --> 01:19:10,093
Jesus.

1559
01:19:10,136 --> 01:19:12,965
Grab my keys.

1560
01:19:13,009 --> 01:19:13,923
God.

1561
01:19:13,966 --> 01:19:15,663
Is it out?

1562
01:19:15,707 --> 01:19:16,947
I don't think I have much time.

1563
01:19:30,983 --> 01:19:31,941
Put it on.

1564
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:35,466
Put it on.

1565
01:19:35,509 --> 01:19:36,467
Do it.

1566
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:38,164
Do it now.

1567
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:39,881
All right, and just let me
know when you're done because I

1568
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:41,385
don't want to risk seeing it.

1569
01:19:41,428 --> 01:19:42,255
All right?

1570
01:19:42,299 --> 01:19:43,561
You just let me know.

1571
01:19:43,604 --> 01:19:44,844
Put it on.

1572
01:19:49,045 --> 01:19:50,524
You good?

1573
01:19:50,568 --> 01:19:52,135
How you doing?

1574
01:19:52,178 --> 01:19:54,746
Just an appropriate size hole.

1575
01:20:01,579 --> 01:20:05,801
Put it in the hole and bury it.

1576
01:20:05,844 --> 01:20:07,585
Right?

1577
01:20:07,628 --> 01:20:10,022
Then we'll be done.

1578
01:20:10,066 --> 01:20:11,415
We'll be done.

1579
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:13,678
Now you just let me
know when you're done.

1580
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:17,769
Just tap me on the shoulder or
just whistle or-- or something

1581
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,685
so I don't risk look--
looking at it, OK?

1582
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,258
Jamie?

1583
01:20:28,301 --> 01:20:29,301
Are you done?

1584
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jaime?

1585
01:21:26,446 --> 01:21:27,012
Hello?

1586
01:21:27,056 --> 01:21:28,056
Sam?

1587
01:21:30,755 --> 01:21:31,712
It's over.

1588
01:21:31,756 --> 01:21:33,932
I finished it.

1589
01:21:36,543 --> 01:21:39,416
OK.

1590
01:21:39,459 --> 01:21:42,071
May he rest in peace.

1591
01:21:42,114 --> 01:21:43,114
Bye, Chuck.

1592
01:22:15,147 --> 01:22:17,410
Sam,
Sheriff James here.

1593
01:22:17,454 --> 01:22:19,543
Just got in the office
and I heard your voicemail

1594
01:22:19,586 --> 01:22:21,327
and your friend's too.

1595
01:22:21,371 --> 01:22:23,242
Look, I know you kids
love messing around,

1596
01:22:23,286 --> 01:22:25,810
but I don't think that land's
something to joke about.

1597
01:22:25,853 --> 01:22:28,769
Things have been good out there
since your family took over,

1598
01:22:28,813 --> 01:22:30,641
and I can't imagine
you doing anything

1599
01:22:30,684 --> 01:22:32,556
to screw that up, right?

1600
01:22:32,599 --> 01:22:34,186
My granddaughter will
be at camp this year,

1601
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:36,821
so keep an eye on her.

1602
01:22:36,864 --> 01:22:38,494
I'll be sure to come by
and make sure everyone's

1603
01:22:38,518 --> 01:22:39,998
staying out of trouble.

1604
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:41,521
Bye, Sam.

1605
01:23:23,911 --> 01:23:24,825
Rings of Saturn.

1606
01:23:24,869 --> 01:23:26,044
This is Chuck.

1607
01:23:26,088 --> 01:23:27,132
Chuck!

1608
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:51,069
I was
on the hunt for blood.

1609
01:23:51,113 --> 01:23:53,985
You were feeling lost in love.

1610
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:59,991
All it took was just one
look and you were into me.

1611
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,994
I wish that I
could cut you free.

1612
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,953
But you're already in too deep.

1613
01:24:05,997 --> 01:24:10,436
You feel the curiosity
of what we could be.

1614
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,439
Baby, if it's on,
don't hesitate.

1615
01:24:13,483 --> 01:24:16,442
I promise you I'll
be your best mistake.

1616
01:24:16,486 --> 01:24:17,922
You found me for a reason.

1617
01:24:17,965 --> 01:24:19,358
Call it fate.

1618
01:24:19,402 --> 01:24:22,405
Call-- call it fate.
'Cause it's feeling great.

1619
01:24:22,448 --> 01:24:25,408
The night's about to get real.

1620
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:28,411
We're going in for the kill.

1621
01:24:28,454 --> 01:24:29,934
This is power.

1622
01:24:29,977 --> 01:24:32,371
It's not cold-hearted.

1623
01:24:32,415 --> 01:24:35,896
And we're just getting started.

1624
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,899
We've been having so much fun.

1625
01:24:38,943 --> 01:24:41,902
This night's been a thriller.

1626
01:24:41,946 --> 01:24:44,862
Don't think about
what we've done.

1627
01:24:44,905 --> 01:24:47,865
You might be the killer.

1628
01:24:47,908 --> 01:24:50,868
You can take your hands off me.

1629
01:24:50,911 --> 01:24:53,871
This night's been a thriller.

1630
01:24:53,914 --> 01:24:56,874
As long as you see what I see.

1631
01:24:56,917 --> 01:24:59,833
You might be the killer.

1632
01:24:59,877 --> 01:25:02,836
We've been having so much fun.

1633
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,839
This night's been a thriller.

1634
01:25:05,883 --> 01:25:08,842
Don't think about
what we've done.

1635
01:25:08,886 --> 01:25:12,324
You might be the killer.

1636
01:25:12,368 --> 01:25:14,805
You can take your hands off me.

1637
01:25:14,848 --> 01:25:17,808
This night's been a thriller.

1638
01:25:17,851 --> 01:25:20,811
As long as you see what I see.

1639
01:25:20,854 --> 01:25:24,293
You might be the killer.

1640
01:25:24,336 --> 01:25:30,081
Baby, after just one touch,
I knew I'd never get enough.

1641
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:36,087
You should know I like it rough,
but you'll get used to me.

1642
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:39,090
Baby, you can count me dead.

1643
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:42,093
Sleep by all the
things you said.

1644
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:48,055
But, baby, you look good in
red, so just keep killing me.

1645
01:25:48,099 --> 01:25:50,754
We've been having so much fun.

1646
01:25:50,797 --> 01:25:53,757
This night's been a thriller.

1647
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,760
Don't think about
what we've done.

1648
01:25:56,803 --> 01:26:00,067
You might be the killer.

1649
01:26:00,111 --> 01:26:02,766
You can take your hands off me.

1650
01:26:02,809 --> 01:26:06,073
This night's been a thriller.

1651
01:26:06,117 --> 01:26:08,772
As long as you see what I see.

1652
01:26:08,815 --> 01:26:10,165
You might be the killer.

1653
01:26:14,821 --> 01:26:16,171
You might be the killer.

1654
01:26:21,132 --> 01:26:22,372
And we're just getting started.

1655
01:26:36,103 --> 01:26:38,758
We've been having so much fun.

1656
01:26:38,802 --> 01:26:41,761
This night's been a thriller.

1657
01:26:41,805 --> 01:26:44,764
Don't think about
what we've done.

1658
01:26:44,808 --> 01:26:48,072
You might be the killer.

1659
01:26:48,115 --> 01:26:50,770
You can take your hands off me.

1660
01:26:50,814 --> 01:26:54,078
This night's been a thriller.

1661
01:26:54,121 --> 01:26:56,776
As long as you see what I see.

1662
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:58,213
You might be the killer.

1663
01:27:02,782 --> 01:27:04,175
You might be the killer.
