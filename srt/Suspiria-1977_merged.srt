1
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:44,488
Suzy Bannion decided to
perfect her ballet studies...

2
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:47,324
In the most famous school of dance in Europe.

3
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:51,161
She chose the celebrated academy of Freiburg.

4
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:54,998
One day at 9:00 in the morning,
She left Kennedy airport, New york,

5
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:58,835
And arrived in Germany at
10:40 p.m. Local time.

6
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,422
Taxi!

7
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:29,926
Taxi, taxi!

8
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:34,264
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

9
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:50,197
Taxi! Taxi!

10
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,202
Can you give me a hand?

11
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,223
Uh, Escherstrausse.

12
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:19,476
- Was?
- Escherstrausse.

13
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:21,478
Was?

14
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:28,485
Ah, Escherstrausse.

15
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:30,821
Ja, ja.

16
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,542
Has it been raining this hard for long?

17
00:04:30,547 --> 00:04:33,800
Half an hour.

18
00:05:41,952 --> 00:05:44,454
Can you wait a minute, please?

19
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:06,226
- Hello?
- Who is it?

20
00:06:06,226 --> 00:06:09,730
Suzy Bannion. I just got in from New York.

21
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,233
- I don't know you. Go away!
- But I have the letter you sent.

22
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:16,737
Look, it's really raining hard. You
could just let me in and I'll explain.

23
00:06:16,737 --> 00:06:19,239
- Go away. Go away!
- But you don't understand!

24
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:25,245
Wait! Wait a minute. Wait.

25
00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:30,751
Hello. Is anybody there?

26
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:32,753
Hello?

27
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

28
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,085
If you're happy enough with the couch,
you can stay for as long as you please.

29
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:58,588
Thanks, but I'll be leaving in the morning.

30
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:01,591
- I'm going away forever.
- Oh, big deal, kid.

31
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:04,094
So what if you've been thrown out of school?

32
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:08,098
I always got kicked out of school,
beginning in kindergarten.

33
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:11,601
No, that's not it. I don't give a
damn about getting kicked out.

34
00:08:12,018 --> 00:08:13,854
Well, then?

35
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:16,356
It's useless to try and explain it to you.

36
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:18,358
You wouldn't understand.

37
00:08:18,358 --> 00:08:20,861
It all seems so... Absurd,

38
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:22,863
So fantastic.

39
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:28,785
All I can do is get away from
here as soon as possible.

40
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:31,872
Would you mind if I used the
bathroom? I'd like to dry off.

41
00:08:31,872 --> 00:08:34,291
No, of course not. Go ahead.

42
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

43
00:08:56,813 --> 00:08:59,316
Hey, why don't you close it?

44
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:05,322
That's better. It was just the wind.

45
00:09:06,823 --> 00:09:09,326
You sure are in bad shape.

46
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,662
You have to tell me all about it.

47
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:16,666
The wind! The windows burst open.

48
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:20,170
- I got scared.
- No. That's not it.

49
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,673
I mean, what it is that's got you so upset.

50
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:30,680
Okay, you can tell me about it later.

51
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

52
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:52,155
Let me in! Pat!

53
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:56,910
Pat! Pat!

54
00:12:00,914 --> 00:12:05,001
Help me! Help me!
There's a murderer!

55
00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:11,675
Help me! Help!
There's a murderer!

56
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:21,017
Help me! Help!

57
00:12:21,435 --> 00:12:23,437
No! No! No!

58
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:39,286
Help me!

59
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:50,297
Help!

60
00:12:54,384 --> 00:12:57,554
There's a murderer!

61
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:21,411
No!

62
00:15:14,941 --> 00:15:17,444
Good morning. Good morning, Daniel.

63
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:19,446
Good morning, miss Tanner.

64
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:25,369
- Good morning. May I help you?
- Yes, I'm Suzy Bannion.

65
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:28,372
We expected you yesterday evening.
You wrote us that...

66
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:30,874
Right. I did arrive
last night about 10:00.

67
00:15:30,874 --> 00:15:33,877
But the door was locked,
and somebody on the call box...

68
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:36,380
Said they didn't know who
I was and couldn't let me in.

69
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,883
- Who said that to you?
- I don't know. She didn't say her name.

70
00:15:39,883 --> 00:15:42,886
I'm so sorry. At any rate,
Now you're here among us,

71
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:47,391
So welcome to our academy. I'm miss
Tanner, one of the instructors.

72
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:49,393
Nice to meet you.

73
00:15:49,393 --> 00:15:52,396
Come along. I'd like to
introduce you to madame Blanc,

74
00:15:52,396 --> 00:15:54,398
Our vice directress.

75
00:15:54,398 --> 00:15:56,400
She was a very famous ballerina.

76
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,402
- Madame Blanc?
- Yes?

77
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:01,738
Suzy Bannion, our new student.

78
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:03,490
Oh, yes.

79
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:08,412
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Of course, madame.

80
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:14,418
You're pretty. Very pretty
indeed. They're policemen.

81
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:18,922
I knew a woman called Bannion years
ago in New York. Carol Bannion.

82
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:21,925
- She's my aunt.
- Good! She's a marvelous woman,

83
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:24,428
A friend and benefactress
of artists everywhere.

84
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:27,931
I'm delighted to have her niece here.

85
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:31,017
Well, I offer our academy's official
welcome in the name of our directress,

86
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:33,520
Who unfortunately is not
here at the moment.

87
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,023
- She's traveling abroad.
- Thank you.

88
00:16:36,023 --> 00:16:40,027
Albert, please wait for me upstairs.

89
00:16:40,027 --> 00:16:43,030
He's my nephew. I'm very attached to him.

90
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,032
I must tell you what I
have to say very quickly...

91
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:47,534
Because those gentlemen
are waiting for me.

92
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:50,537
Something terrible, truly
horrible, has happened.

93
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:55,542
One of our students, Pat Hingle, who was
expelled just yesterday for improper conduct,

94
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:59,796
Was murdered last night by some
madman. It's a frightening story.

95
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:02,299
But I always warn our students,
Don't I, miss Tanner?

96
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:04,801
I tell them to be careful, not to get
involved with questionable friendships.

97
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:08,805
What I wanted to tell you was that
your room here isn't free yet.

98
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:10,807
- Just a slight hitch.
- Yes, but don't worry.

99
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:15,312
We've found you a place to stay with one of
our third-year students who lives in town.

100
00:17:15,312 --> 00:17:18,815
You'll have to pay 50 of your
American dollars a week,

101
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:21,818
But it's a good price, and you can
deduct it from your fee here.

102
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:25,322
Now I entrust you to the care of miss Tanner,
one of our veteran teachers here.

103
00:17:25,822 --> 00:17:31,328
Don't be upset if she seems a little
stern or surly. It's only her manner.
She's even that way with me.

104
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:34,331
She really is an invaluable teacher.

105
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:38,752
- Come with me.
- And now, gentlemen...

106
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:42,005
As you know, our courses last three years,

107
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:44,508
And you must pass an exam
at the end of each year.

108
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:47,511
So, the girl left the school
About 11:00 in the evening?

109
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:51,515
- That's my information.
- Excuse me.

110
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:55,018
When I got here last night about 11:00,
I saw a girl leaving the school.

111
00:17:55,018 --> 00:17:58,522
She's a new student. She just
arrived. What did she look like?

112
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:02,526
Well, she had blonde hair and
was wearing a brown raincoat.

113
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:07,030
- What did she do?
- I don't know. I only saw her
for a minute in a storm.

114
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,033
So you see? It really was 11:00.

115
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:13,036
Coming?

116
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:18,041
We don't teach you how to dance here,
because we presume our students already know how.

117
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:22,045
This is an established academy
dedicated to specializing.

118
00:18:22,045 --> 00:18:25,048
This is Pavlos, our general handyman.

119
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:27,801
He's really ugly, isn't he?
Don't be afraid to say so.

120
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:30,637
He can't understand you, anyway.
He speaks only Romanian.

121
00:18:30,637 --> 00:18:35,142
You see that gorgeous smile? He's been very
handsome ever since he got those false teeth.

122
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:42,149
Last year, he discovered He
had gingivitis of the gums,

123
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:44,651
So he had all his teeth pulled.

124
00:18:44,651 --> 00:18:47,654
The top row one morning.
The bottom row a day later.

125
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:49,656
Bang.

126
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:52,159
- Where are we going?
- To the locker room.

127
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:55,662
We also have a swimming pool,
which you can use when you want.

128
00:18:59,082 --> 00:19:03,587
Miss Tanner. I have something to tell you.

129
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:06,590
- Squawk, squawk. Polly parrot.
- Who said that? Shut up.

130
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,092
That's enough of these little
games for the moment.

131
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:13,096
I want to introduce Suzy Bannion, our new student.

132
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:17,100
You'll find several fellow Americans
among these girls... Miriam, for one.

133
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:20,103
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Your locker's over there.

134
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:22,606
You'll find everything in there except shoes.

135
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:26,610
For today, you can borrow shoes
from someone who has two pairs.

136
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,614
Hurry up, everybody. I'll be waiting
for all of you in the red room.

137
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:33,617
Come with me.

138
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,629
Mata Hari is going to file her report.

139
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:52,135
My name is Olga, and you're my tenant.

140
00:19:52,135 --> 00:19:54,137
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

141
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:57,140
They tell me you have to give me $50 a week.

142
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,643
- Yeah.
- In advance.

143
00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:02,145
Well, don't worry. If you think I'm not... Oh...

144
00:20:02,145 --> 00:20:06,149
Don't get hot under the collar.
That's how people are here.

145
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:11,154
Uh, can anybody lend me a pair of shoes?

146
00:20:11,154 --> 00:20:14,157
- Yes. Me.
- Oh, thank you.

147
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:17,160
If you want to buy them, I can make
you a nice price. Fifteen marks.

148
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,163
Oh, no, thanks. I already have some in my suitcase.

149
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:22,165
I just need a pair for today.

150
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,167
But if you'd rather not...

151
00:20:24,668 --> 00:20:27,170
No. Okay. Go ahead. Take them.

152
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,173
- But, uh, Give them back, hmm?
- Of course.

153
00:20:34,678 --> 00:20:37,180
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

154
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,182
Oh, it's okay. It doesn't matter.

155
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:47,190
Did they shake you up with all
that talk about money?

156
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,192
Well, I'm not exactly used to it.

157
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:51,695
Same with me at first.

158
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:54,197
Then I found out it's a
charming habit around here.

159
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:02,706
I once read that names...

160
00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:06,209
Which begin With the letter "S"...

161
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:08,712
Are the names of snakes.

162
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:16,887
Next year, after I finish the course,

163
00:21:16,887 --> 00:21:19,890
I've got an offer from the
state school of ballet in Geneva.

164
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,893
What about you?

165
00:21:22,893 --> 00:21:26,897
Well, I'll go back to yhe states,
but I'm not exactly sure what I'll do.

166
00:21:27,898 --> 00:21:30,400
Hey, thanks.
My room is really pretty.

167
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,402
- Like it?
- Uh-huh.

168
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:36,907
That makes me happy. I bet we'll do
nicely together. I think you're sweet.

169
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:38,909
Even if I have the name of a snake?

170
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:40,911
I was just kidding.

171
00:21:40,911 --> 00:21:43,413
Don't tell me you're as touchy as Sara.

172
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:45,916
No.

173
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,922
Hello?

174
00:21:51,922 --> 00:21:54,925
Oh, hi! No, no, no.

175
00:21:54,925 --> 00:21:56,927
You did the right thing.

176
00:21:58,428 --> 00:22:00,430
- Hi.
- Hi.

177
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,683
Oh, you didn't have to bring these over here.

178
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:05,185
I could've picked them up myself tomorrow.

179
00:22:05,686 --> 00:22:07,688
I thought you might be needing them.

180
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:09,690
Yes, but it really wasn't necessary.

181
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:14,194
- Anyway, thanks a lot.
- Oh, no. It's nothing.

182
00:22:14,695 --> 00:22:16,697
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

183
00:22:16,697 --> 00:22:19,700
- Don't you want to stay for a while?
- No, thanks. I can't.

184
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,704
I live at the school, so I've got to
be back for supper in half an hour.

185
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:25,706
- I have to.
- Just for a minute?

186
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:28,208
No, no, really. I have to be going.

187
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:31,211
They get very upset if you
show up late for supper.

188
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:35,716
- Okay, sunday. No, not before lunchtime.
- Well, ciao.

189
00:22:35,716 --> 00:22:38,218
See you tomorrow.

190
00:22:38,218 --> 00:22:40,220
Bye.

191
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,222
No, go on.

192
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,226
Uh-huh, I know.

193
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:50,230
You caught one. Yes, yes, I can
hear you very well.

194
00:22:50,731 --> 00:22:52,232
Didn't you see how he was blushing?

195
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:55,235
He's cute, except he doesn't have any, um...

196
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:58,739
And he never has enough money
for room and board at school.

197
00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:01,241
That's why that bitch Tanner
has got him under her thumb.

198
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:03,744
She gives him 1,001 errands to do.

199
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:06,747
Sure.

200
00:23:06,747 --> 00:23:08,749
I got it. Okay.

201
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:11,752
Call me back tomorrow evening.
Give me a chance to think it over.

202
00:23:11,752 --> 00:23:14,087
Yes, yes. Okay, okay.

203
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:16,590
Anyway, he is cute.

204
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,593
Poor Pat. She liked him a lot.

205
00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:23,597
That poor kid, ending up like that.

206
00:23:23,597 --> 00:23:26,099
I can't even think about it.

207
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,602
I heard you saw her yesterday evening.

208
00:23:29,102 --> 00:23:31,605
Uh-huh. Outside the school.

209
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:34,107
She was acting very strange.

210
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:36,109
Mumbling to herself.

211
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,782
She really felt terrible when they kicked
her out, but she really deserved it.

212
00:23:43,283 --> 00:23:46,787
- There was so much noise.
- God, was she difficult.

213
00:23:46,787 --> 00:23:49,289
She was saying things that made no sense.

214
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:52,793
She was always arguing, causing trouble.

215
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:56,046
"Secret."

216
00:23:56,296 --> 00:23:58,799
"Iris."

217
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,300
What?

218
00:24:02,803 --> 00:24:04,805
Uh, I remember...

219
00:24:04,805 --> 00:24:06,807
She mentioned the word "secret."

220
00:24:07,307 --> 00:24:10,811
And then she... Mentioned a flower...

221
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:12,813
Iris, I think, or a lilac.

222
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:15,315
Secret flowers? What's
that supposed to mean?

223
00:24:15,315 --> 00:24:18,318
I don't know. She was a busybody.

224
00:24:18,318 --> 00:24:22,322
It would've been easy for her to
find out one of us was in a jam.

225
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:55,272
- How do you like it at Olga's?
- It's nice.

226
00:24:55,272 --> 00:24:59,276
Those eight on the list this morning,
come with me to the yellow room.

227
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:05,282
Good morning, miss Tanner. Suzy.

228
00:25:05,282 --> 00:25:08,285
- Good morning, madame Blanc.
- I've got good news for you.

229
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:11,288
We have it all arranged.
Your room is ready for you.

230
00:25:11,788 --> 00:25:14,291
Isn't that marvelous? You can
move in today, if you like.

231
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:16,793
But I'd rather stay at Olga's, if it's okay.

232
00:25:17,294 --> 00:25:19,296
Doesn't matter to me, my dear,

233
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:22,299
But in your letter of enrollment, you
said you'd be boarding at the school.

234
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:25,302
- I know, but...
- The room is free now.

235
00:25:25,302 --> 00:25:28,805
- Well, I didn't think it was so important.
- As you wish.

236
00:25:28,805 --> 00:25:31,308
If that's what you want, so be it.

237
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,822
Sara?

238
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:51,828
I had no idea you were so strong-willed.

239
00:25:51,828 --> 00:25:54,831
I see that when you make up
your mind about something,

240
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:57,334
Nothing will change it for you.

241
00:25:57,334 --> 00:25:59,336
My compliments.

242
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:42,879
Witch!

243
00:27:40,771 --> 00:27:43,273
And then, toward the end of the 19th century,

244
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:46,276
The technique of classical ballet...

245
00:27:46,276 --> 00:27:49,780
Assumed a different, more stylized impostation.

246
00:27:51,281 --> 00:27:53,784
All right. Let's warm up.

247
00:27:54,284 --> 00:27:56,787
What's wrong? Don't you feel well?

248
00:27:56,787 --> 00:28:00,290
No, it's nothing. I just feel a little weak.

249
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,793
If it gets any worse, I'll just stop.

250
00:28:02,793 --> 00:28:04,795
And now some exercises.

251
00:28:04,795 --> 00:28:07,798
Daniel, you may begin.

252
00:28:12,969 --> 00:28:16,973
One, two, three and four.

253
00:28:16,973 --> 00:28:19,476
And one and two...

254
00:28:19,476 --> 00:28:21,978
And three and four.

255
00:28:22,062 --> 00:28:23,563
And one and two...

256
00:28:24,064 --> 00:28:25,565
And three and four.

257
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:27,567
- And one...
- I'm sorry, miss Tanner.

258
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:31,071
I feel a little weak. Can I
just rest for a second?

259
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:34,324
Weak? Come on. It's an easy step.

260
00:28:34,324 --> 00:28:36,827
This is the first time we've worked together.

261
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:39,830
I want to see what you can do,
how far along you are.

262
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,834
Now, come along and join the others.
Come on; let's go.

263
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:46,586
Daniel?

264
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:49,589
All together now.

265
00:28:52,592 --> 00:28:54,594
And one and two...

266
00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:57,597
And three and four.

267
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:02,102
- I can't. Please.
- And one and two...

268
00:29:02,102 --> 00:29:04,104
And three and four.

269
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:09,609
And one and two and three and four.

270
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,864
And one and two and three and four.

271
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:18,118
Pay attention, Suzy. Get those legs
up higher. You're not paralyzed.

272
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:24,541
Get those legs up higher.
And one and two and three and...

273
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:27,627
Pay attention, Suzy. And one and two...

274
00:29:27,627 --> 00:29:30,130
And three and four.

275
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,134
And one and two and three and four.

276
00:30:04,831 --> 00:30:07,334
Come on. Come on. Run along.

277
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:09,836
Come on. Drink up.

278
00:30:09,836 --> 00:30:12,839
- Oh, you... You must drink.
- No, that's enough.

279
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:15,342
You heard what the doctor said.

280
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:17,844
- Drink up.
- No.

281
00:30:17,844 --> 00:30:19,846
You must drink.

282
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,933
The blood that was hemorrhaging is
going back with the intake of liquids.

283
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:26,937
- Right, professor Verdegast?
- Obviously.

284
00:30:26,937 --> 00:30:29,439
My dear madame.

285
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:33,443
Do not be concerned. It's nothing,
as I've already told the young lady.

286
00:30:33,443 --> 00:30:36,446
That's a relief, professor.
How do you feel, dear?

287
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:39,449
- Uh, better.
- The fault lies with your exercises.

288
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:44,955
When somebody's been out of practice,
violent movement could cause tiny
tears in internal ligaments.

289
00:30:44,955 --> 00:30:46,957
Thus the hemorrhaging.

290
00:30:47,457 --> 00:30:50,961
You look better already. You've
even got color back in your cheeks.

291
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:52,963
- Isn't that right?
- Oh, yes. She looks much better.

292
00:30:53,463 --> 00:30:54,965
- Ow!
- Hold still.

293
00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:58,468
This will get you back into shape in no time.

294
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:04,474
Here we are. Fine, fine. A day or two,
you'll be on your feet, as good as new.

295
00:31:07,477 --> 00:31:11,481
- Who brought my bags here?
- Olga. What a dear.

296
00:31:11,481 --> 00:31:14,484
The minute she heard you were ill, she
went right home and brought your things.

297
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:18,488
Oh, and she also left me your $50,
and she didn't take a penny of it.

298
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:21,491
Why... Why did she do that?

299
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:24,494
- If I wanted to, I would...
- Well, my dear,

300
00:31:24,494 --> 00:31:27,497
What you need now is
some peace and quiet.

301
00:31:27,497 --> 00:31:31,001
If the hemorrhaging should start
again, which is very improbable,

302
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:33,503
You can telephone me.

303
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:37,007
And Tanner, she is to eat
bland food for about a week.

304
00:31:37,507 --> 00:31:39,509
And you mustn't let
her have any fruit.

305
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,012
- A drop of vin rose?
- Yes.

306
00:31:42,012 --> 00:31:45,515
Good. A glass of red wine with
each meal. It works miracles.

307
00:31:45,515 --> 00:31:49,019
Clears up anemia and strengthens
red corpuscles. It builds the blood.

308
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,023
Rest well. You're in good hands.

309
00:32:16,797 --> 00:32:20,300
Suzy, we're next-door neighbors.

310
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,303
So, you moved in here.

311
00:32:23,303 --> 00:32:26,306
Well, they moved me in here.

312
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:28,308
I really didn't want to.

313
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:31,812
You know, as soon as I got sick,
your pal Olga ran and got my bags...

314
00:32:31,812 --> 00:32:33,814
And threw me out of her place.

315
00:32:33,814 --> 00:32:37,317
She must've thought I had
something awfully contagious.

316
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:42,322
But I can't stand to live in a
boarding school like a ten-year-old.

317
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:45,325
Oh, wow. You come back strong.

318
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:47,828
Yeah, you know, I feel really well.

319
00:32:47,828 --> 00:32:51,331
I mean, it's almost as if nothing
had happened. It's incredible.

320
00:32:51,331 --> 00:32:54,835
- And all thanks to professor Verdegast.
- Verdegast?

321
00:32:54,835 --> 00:32:56,837
- He came to look at you?
- Yeah.

322
00:32:56,837 --> 00:32:59,339
Come in.

323
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:03,844
Hi, Pavlos.

324
00:33:14,771 --> 00:33:16,773
Thank you.

325
00:33:18,775 --> 00:33:21,778
You'd better keep an eye on that
lighter. He really likes it.

326
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:23,780
Yes, but I don't think he's a thief.

327
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,782
At least you know.

328
00:33:25,782 --> 00:33:29,786
- Are you eating up here?
- Yeah, they put me on a restricted diet.

329
00:33:29,786 --> 00:33:32,789
And on a restricted diet, they give you wine?

330
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:36,793
That's professor Verdegast's idea.
Says it'll build up my blood.

331
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:46,136
The bell. Oh, god. That means
it's only 15 minutes till supper.

332
00:33:46,136 --> 00:33:48,638
I'd better change.

333
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:51,641
- Ciao. See you later.
- Okay.

334
00:35:22,232 --> 00:35:24,234
Where? Where?

335
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:26,236
Everywhere. The whole floor.

336
00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:29,239
It's disgusting! It's disgusting!

337
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:31,742
- Where are they coming from?
- I don't know! Let's go and see!

338
00:35:31,742 --> 00:35:35,245
- They're coming from the ceiling.
- In the meantime, everybody downstairs.

339
00:35:48,425 --> 00:35:50,427
Don't let anyone come up.

340
00:36:45,982 --> 00:36:49,986
I'm sorry. Truly mortified.
Please excuse me.

341
00:36:49,986 --> 00:36:51,988
But it was nothing to do
with you, madame.

342
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:54,991
No, of course not, girls.
It was not madame Blanc's fault.

343
00:36:54,991 --> 00:36:57,744
We ordered those cases
of food by mail...

344
00:36:58,245 --> 00:37:00,247
From a reliable firm that
we thought to be honest.

345
00:37:00,664 --> 00:37:02,165
Obviously, It arrived spoiled.

346
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:04,668
In a few days' time,
you see what happened.

347
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:07,421
- Oh, it was awful.
- Yes, one got in my mouth.

348
00:37:07,421 --> 00:37:11,425
I suppose we're fortunate those things
only reached the floor below the attic.

349
00:37:11,425 --> 00:37:14,428
- Are the other floors all right?
- Yes. We checked them out.

350
00:37:14,428 --> 00:37:16,430
Just the floor where the
students' rooms are.

351
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,433
Well, I'll take care of the problem
of fumigating in the morning.

352
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:22,936
In the meantime, for tonight, I've
thought of a makeshift arrangement.

353
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:25,439
Go and see how they're getting
along, will you, dear?

354
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,443
The boys have kindly offered to help,

355
00:37:29,443 --> 00:37:31,945
And they and the servants are turning
the practice hall into a dormitory.

356
00:37:32,446 --> 00:37:35,949
If some of you choose to find hotel
rooms, I'll have no objections.

357
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:37,951
But it's already late,
and in any case,

358
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:39,953
The inconvenience will only
be for one night.

359
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:42,289
We'll all sleep together.

360
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,792
- Bravo.
- You all right?

361
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:48,295
- Yes, thank you.
- Fine.

362
00:37:48,795 --> 00:37:50,797
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, thank you.

363
00:37:51,298 --> 00:37:52,799
- Good.
- Are you all right?

364
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,801
Yes, madame Blanc. Thank you.

365
00:37:55,302 --> 00:37:57,804
- Oh, it's very comfortable. Just like being in camp.
- Good.

366
00:37:58,305 --> 00:38:00,307
Are you sleeping here with
us, too, Madame Blanc?

367
00:38:00,807 --> 00:38:02,809
Certainly, as are all the other
teachers and miss Tanner.

368
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,812
Do the teachers live here at school?

369
00:38:05,812 --> 00:38:07,814
No, they live in town.

370
00:38:07,814 --> 00:38:11,318
They leave after supper at
9:30, just like clockwork.

371
00:38:11,485 --> 00:38:13,487
It's very late. You won't be afraid
if I turn out the lights?

372
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:16,490
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night. Good night.

373
00:38:55,696 --> 00:38:58,198
Is that guy hot for you?

374
00:38:58,198 --> 00:39:00,158
- Maybe.
- That's funny.

375
00:39:00,784 --> 00:39:03,078
I heard he was, uh...

376
00:39:03,078 --> 00:39:08,625
- Of course, I'm not much of a gossip.
- That's a good one.

377
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:11,211
Come on. You tried to get
him and didn't make it.

378
00:39:11,211 --> 00:39:13,171
- You liar! That's not...
- Why don't you two shut up?

379
00:39:13,171 --> 00:39:15,716
Some of us want to go to sleep.

380
00:39:20,721 --> 00:39:24,224
Hey, Sara. Forget it. It's okay.

381
00:40:45,472 --> 00:40:47,641
Suzy, are you asleep?

382
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:50,394
- Were you sleeping?
- No. What's the matter?

383
00:40:52,396 --> 00:40:54,523
You hear that snoring?

384
00:40:54,523 --> 00:40:57,401
It's weird.

385
00:40:57,401 --> 00:41:00,278
Hear it?

386
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:02,656
Where do you think it's coming from?

387
00:41:08,995 --> 00:41:12,332
Behind the sheet.

388
00:41:12,332 --> 00:41:14,835
Lies!

389
00:41:14,835 --> 00:41:16,920
What?

390
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:22,426
They lied to us.

391
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:24,928
The directress is here.

392
00:41:24,928 --> 00:41:28,432
That's her, the one who's snoring.

393
00:41:28,432 --> 00:41:30,934
She's the directress.

394
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:33,395
- How do you know?
- I'm sure it's her.

395
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,734
Last year, for a while,

396
00:41:38,734 --> 00:41:40,861
I lived in one of the guest rooms...

397
00:41:40,861 --> 00:41:43,030
Under the top of the stairs.

398
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:48,535
One night,

399
00:41:48,535 --> 00:41:52,289
I heard someone coming very late in,

400
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:55,459
Getting into bed in the room next to mine.

401
00:41:56,543 --> 00:41:58,628
And then...

402
00:41:58,628 --> 00:42:02,215
Then I heard this weird kind of snoring.

403
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:05,802
I tell you, it was so weird
I never forgot it.

404
00:42:08,388 --> 00:42:10,807
Listen.

405
00:42:11,308 --> 00:42:13,393
You hear that whistle?

406
00:42:14,603 --> 00:42:17,564
It's exactly the same.

407
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:21,568
The next morning, madame Blanc told me...

408
00:42:21,568 --> 00:42:24,071
That the directress had spent
a few hours at the school...

409
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:27,074
And had slept in the room next to mine.

410
00:42:29,701 --> 00:42:31,244
You see?

411
00:42:31,745 --> 00:42:35,332
So I know she's the directress.

412
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:37,334
She's here.

413
00:42:40,504 --> 00:42:42,506
She's there.

414
00:42:42,506 --> 00:42:45,592
Right behind that sheet.

415
00:43:07,864 --> 00:43:10,867
Thank you. I'm grateful you can take
care of the fumigating so promptly.

416
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:13,870
- Good morning, madame Blanc.
- Good morning, Daniel.

417
00:43:14,371 --> 00:43:17,374
- Is everything in order now?
- All cleaned up, madame.

418
00:43:17,374 --> 00:43:19,876
Just to be sure, we checked
the other floors too.

419
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,882
Miss Tanner. Excuse me.

420
00:43:25,882 --> 00:43:27,884
Did the directress sleep
here last night?

421
00:43:27,884 --> 00:43:30,887
- No, she didn't. Good morning, Daniel.
- Good morning.

422
00:43:31,388 --> 00:43:35,392
You know she's away on a trip. Maybe
she'll pay us a visit two weeks from now.

423
00:43:35,392 --> 00:43:38,895
Excuse me, miss Tanner, But which
class do I attend this morning?

424
00:43:38,895 --> 00:43:40,897
The second-year class in the red room.

425
00:43:40,897 --> 00:43:42,899
Thank you.

426
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:44,211
Stop!

427
00:44:44,211 --> 00:44:47,214
Stop! Stop!

428
00:44:47,214 --> 00:44:50,217
Enough. Enough!

429
00:44:50,217 --> 00:44:53,220
- Do you know what happened? Do you know?
- What day is it?

430
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,723
Your lousy, disgusting
dog has bitten Albert!

431
00:44:56,723 --> 00:44:58,725
He took a piece out
of Albert's arm.

432
00:44:59,226 --> 00:45:01,728
- What?
- Did you all hear that?

433
00:45:01,728 --> 00:45:04,731
That miserable dog tried
to mutilate a child.

434
00:45:04,731 --> 00:45:08,735
Madame Blanc had to rush Albert to
a first-aid center to have stitches put in!

435
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:12,239
- That's impossible.
- Let's go to the first-aid center.

436
00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:15,742
Even if you can't see the blood, at least
you can hear the poor child's crying.

437
00:45:15,742 --> 00:45:17,744
That's enough now!

438
00:45:18,245 --> 00:45:21,748
My dog's a peaceful, faithful
animal. He's never hurt anyone.

439
00:45:21,748 --> 00:45:24,251
The boy must have done
something to him first!

440
00:45:24,251 --> 00:45:27,754
Oh, the poor little animal!
The poor little puppy!

441
00:45:27,754 --> 00:45:32,259
If I ever see him within a mile of this
school again, I'll have him put to death!

442
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:34,261
Stop it!

443
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:36,263
I won't allow such talk, you understand?

444
00:45:36,263 --> 00:45:39,266
You won't allow it?

445
00:45:39,266 --> 00:45:41,768
Then get out! You and your dog!

446
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:45,272
- Get moving!
- You bitch!

447
00:45:45,272 --> 00:45:47,274
Out!

448
00:45:47,274 --> 00:45:50,277
I'm going. I'm going.

449
00:45:50,277 --> 00:45:52,779
But try to understand that...

450
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,783
That I'm blind, not deaf.

451
00:45:57,284 --> 00:45:59,286
Get it? Huh?

452
00:45:59,286 --> 00:46:01,288
Not deaf.

453
00:46:01,538 --> 00:46:04,041
Not deaf. You understand that?

454
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:06,043
You understand?

455
00:46:08,545 --> 00:46:11,548
Ahh, fresh air!

456
00:46:11,548 --> 00:46:14,051
Let me out of this gilded parade.

457
00:46:14,551 --> 00:46:18,555
Get out! Get out of here! Good riddance!

458
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:26,063
Oh, Pavlos, how much longer
do I have to eat like this?

459
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,673
Hey, listen.

460
00:46:52,673 --> 00:46:56,677
There they go, right on schedule.

461
00:46:56,677 --> 00:46:59,179
The teachers. Remember?

462
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,184
Can you hear them?
They're going away.

463
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:10,190
You hear them?

464
00:47:12,192 --> 00:47:14,194
Yes.

465
00:47:18,865 --> 00:47:20,867
I...

466
00:47:30,877 --> 00:47:34,381
l... I don't think they'll
even miss school.

467
00:47:34,381 --> 00:47:37,384
What? What did you say?

468
00:47:37,384 --> 00:47:39,886
Wake up.

469
00:47:39,886 --> 00:47:44,391
I said, it doesn't seem to
me that they're going out.

470
00:47:45,892 --> 00:47:48,395
A front door is on the left.

471
00:47:49,896 --> 00:47:53,400
Their footsteps are going to the
right, somewhere inside the school.

472
00:47:54,901 --> 00:47:57,904
Jesus, Suzy.

473
00:47:57,904 --> 00:47:58,905
- You're a genius.
- Mmm.

474
00:48:00,407 --> 00:48:02,409
Fantastic.

475
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:05,829
How come I never noticed that before?

476
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:10,834
Suzy. If they don't leave,
Where do they go?

477
00:48:11,334 --> 00:48:13,336
Wake up. Suzy.

478
00:48:13,336 --> 00:48:18,175
Come on. Wake up. Suzy!

479
00:48:19,676 --> 00:48:22,179
I'm so sleepy.

480
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:24,181
I don't know why. I'm sorry.

481
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:27,184
Maybe...

482
00:48:27,184 --> 00:48:29,686
Maybe we can find out where they really go.

483
00:48:31,188 --> 00:48:35,692
Of course!
Yes.

484
00:48:39,196 --> 00:48:42,199
Begin to count the steps as they go.

485
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:01,468
It's like the search of alietne.

486
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:29,843
Easy.

487
00:52:31,345 --> 00:52:33,347
What is it? Huh?

488
00:52:33,347 --> 00:52:35,349
Come on.

489
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:38,852
Come on; let's go home.

490
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:04,127
Who is that? Who's there?

491
00:53:05,629 --> 00:53:07,798
Easy, boy.

492
00:53:13,303 --> 00:53:15,305
What is it?

493
00:53:17,808 --> 00:53:19,893
What's happening?

494
00:53:24,564 --> 00:53:27,025
Who's there?

495
00:53:31,488 --> 00:53:33,990
Who's there?

496
00:53:48,171 --> 00:53:50,173
Wait!

497
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

498
00:55:46,456 --> 00:55:49,543
Poor Daniel. Torn to pieces. Incredible.

499
00:55:49,543 --> 00:55:52,546
Oh, yeah, but you can never put
too much trust in wolfhounds.

500
00:55:52,546 --> 00:55:56,049
They're crazy. We had two of them
once at the villa in Gestaad.

501
00:55:56,049 --> 00:55:59,052
My god. First Pat gets
murdered by a madman,

502
00:55:59,052 --> 00:56:01,555
And now Daniel is killed by his dog.

503
00:56:01,555 --> 00:56:04,057
Yeah. Maybe there's a hex on the place.

504
00:56:04,558 --> 00:56:08,562
Yeah. Let's call in the exorcist
and have it purged.

505
00:56:09,062 --> 00:56:13,066
- What is it? Is something wrong?
- No, everything's all right.

506
00:56:13,316 --> 00:56:15,819
Is it something personal, dear?

507
00:56:15,819 --> 00:56:18,321
No, no, it's nothing like that.

508
00:56:19,823 --> 00:56:22,325
Miss Tanner, would you mind?

509
00:56:22,492 --> 00:56:24,494
I'd like a few minutes
alone with Suzy.

510
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,002
Well? What is it?

511
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:36,006
I just wanted to talk to you about some of
the things that have been happening lately.

512
00:56:36,506 --> 00:56:39,509
Oh, I know you're upset by Daniel's
death, as we all have been.

513
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:41,511
No, but it's more than that.

514
00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:44,514
Does anybody know anything
about who killed Pat?

515
00:56:45,015 --> 00:56:46,516
I spoke with the chief of
police just this morning.

516
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:49,019
He told me they had
some definite clues.

517
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:52,522
- You know that I saw her the night I arrived here.
- Yes, you told me that.

518
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:55,984
And that she was mumbling some
strange, unrelated words.

519
00:56:56,526 --> 00:56:58,987
No, you didn't tell me that.

520
00:56:58,987 --> 00:57:02,532
Because it was something that didn't
make any sense. It was in a thunderstorm.

521
00:57:02,532 --> 00:57:05,535
I just didn't pay much attention to it.

522
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,538
I only caught two words distinctly:

523
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:10,999
"Secret" and "Irises."

524
00:57:10,999 --> 00:57:14,544
I don't know what they mean, but
I thought they might be important.

525
00:57:14,544 --> 00:57:16,546
You've done very well. Congratulations.

526
00:57:16,546 --> 00:57:19,549
I don't know what the words
"Secret" or "Irises" mean either.

527
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:22,010
But I think it's only right we should
let the police know about it.

528
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:26,515
I'm only amazed you waited
two days before... hello?

529
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:30,310
- You really messed things up.
- What are you talking about?

530
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:33,313
Because... Maybe Pat was talking to...

531
00:57:33,814 --> 00:57:36,316
Someone just inside the building that night.

532
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,823
And we know that someone
wasn't one of the teachers.

533
00:57:49,579 --> 00:57:51,581
Come on.

534
00:57:54,084 --> 00:57:56,586
Now you've put them
on the hunt for somebody.

535
00:57:56,586 --> 00:57:59,589
What difference does that make to you?

536
00:57:59,589 --> 00:58:01,591
Big difference.

537
00:58:02,592 --> 00:58:05,595
Because I was Pat's friend.

538
00:58:06,096 --> 00:58:08,598
She was telling me something
When you suddenly showed up.

539
00:58:08,598 --> 00:58:12,102
She got scared and she ran away.

540
00:58:12,102 --> 00:58:14,604
She was in hysterics almost.

541
00:58:15,105 --> 00:58:17,107
And then she was killed.

542
00:58:17,107 --> 00:58:20,610
Remember that voice when you rang the bell?

543
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:23,113
Well, that was me.

544
00:59:19,169 --> 00:59:23,173
I heard strange, incredible, absurd things.

545
00:59:23,173 --> 00:59:25,676
Pat was taking notes on them for months.

546
00:59:25,676 --> 00:59:29,179
And before going away,
she gave me all the notes.

547
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:32,683
I've only told one person,
a very good friend of mine.

548
00:59:32,683 --> 00:59:35,686
Frank Mandel. He's here
for a convention.

549
00:59:36,186 --> 00:59:39,189
I'll let you read them tonight.

550
00:59:49,866 --> 00:59:53,870
Suzy, wake up. Please. Wake up.

551
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:57,332
The notes are gone! Someone
stole them from me!

552
00:59:57,708 --> 01:00:01,128
You understand? They disappeared.

553
01:00:01,128 --> 01:00:05,966
Don't fall asleep! Please help me!

554
01:00:06,216 --> 01:00:09,219
- Wake up! Help me!
- I can't.

555
01:00:09,469 --> 01:00:10,971
Can't?

556
01:00:13,473 --> 01:00:18,478
This is the only thing I got left,
and that's because I kept it on me. Look.

557
01:00:18,478 --> 01:00:20,981
- Look.
- What is it?

558
01:00:20,981 --> 01:00:25,485
What's the matter with you? Don't
you remember? What's going on?

559
01:00:25,736 --> 01:00:29,740
This is the key that'll get us
wherever the teachers go every night.

560
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:33,744
I thought it out yesterday evening
while I was sitting here next to you.

561
01:00:33,744 --> 01:00:39,458
Suzy, do you know
anything about witches?

562
01:00:45,005 --> 01:00:48,008
Oh, no! Please!

563
01:00:49,468 --> 01:00:53,013
Don't leave me alone!

564
01:01:04,983 --> 01:01:07,986
I must get away!

565
01:03:04,311 --> 01:03:07,773
Wait!

566
01:03:28,001 --> 01:03:31,004
Wait!

567
01:04:03,412 --> 01:04:05,956
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

568
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

569
01:08:58,832 --> 01:09:01,710
Looking for Sara? She's disappeared.

570
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:04,713
But that's impossible. I just
talked to her last night.

571
01:09:04,713 --> 01:09:08,717
She left this morning, as a matter
of fact, without telling anyone.

572
01:09:08,717 --> 01:09:12,220
Just packed her bags and left. She
was heard leaving about 6:00.

573
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:15,724
- You heard her leave, didn't you?
- Sara? Oh, yes.

574
01:09:15,724 --> 01:09:19,227
I heard the door close and her
footsteps going down the hall.

575
01:09:19,227 --> 01:09:23,231
And then I heard a car driving off down the
street. I guess someone was waiting for her.

576
01:09:23,231 --> 01:09:28,236
- But it's impossible.
- If she wasn't happy here, she could've told someone.

577
01:09:28,737 --> 01:09:31,239
Why sneak off like a thief?

578
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:45,504
Hello. May I speak to Frank
Mandel, please? Yes, thank you.

579
01:09:47,005 --> 01:09:50,008
Hello. This is Suzy Bannion.

580
01:09:50,008 --> 01:09:53,011
No, we've never met. I'm a
friend of Sara's.

581
01:09:53,011 --> 01:09:57,516
Yes. Hello. Do you happen to
know where Sara is?

582
01:09:59,017 --> 01:10:02,020
Well, she disappeared from
school this morning.

583
01:10:02,521 --> 01:10:05,524
Yes, it seems she left and
took all her luggage.

584
01:10:05,524 --> 01:10:10,028
Yes. Uh, listen, could I see
you sometime today?

585
01:10:11,029 --> 01:10:14,032
Well, I'm really worried about her.

586
01:10:14,032 --> 01:10:18,537
Oh, great. Where?

587
01:10:18,537 --> 01:10:22,040
At the convention center.
Okay. I'll see you there.

588
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,544
She didn't inform any of her classmates.
I've already asked all of them.

589
01:10:25,544 --> 01:10:29,047
It's very upsetting. I can't
understand why she did it.

590
01:10:29,548 --> 01:10:32,050
I'm the one who's held responsible
by their families.

591
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:35,679
I'll call her father in Geneva.
Perhaps she might have gone there.

592
01:10:48,692 --> 01:10:52,696
I've already phoned Sara's father.
He's the Italian consul in Geneva.

593
01:10:52,696 --> 01:10:57,200
But he wasn't there today.
He was away for the weekend.

594
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:01,204
They said he'd be back by monday, and
they don't know anything about her there.

595
01:11:01,204 --> 01:11:04,207
Well, do you understand
Why I'm so worried?

596
01:11:04,207 --> 01:11:08,712
Yes, but before we both get upset,
let's wait for the father's return.

597
01:11:08,712 --> 01:11:12,215
Maybe they got together this morning
and went off on their own.

598
01:11:12,215 --> 01:11:18,221
I know her quite well. She was a
patient of mine three years ago.

599
01:11:18,221 --> 01:11:22,225
- Were you aware of that?
- No. I didn't even know you were a psychiatrist.

600
01:11:22,225 --> 01:11:26,730
Well, she had a nervous breakdown
after her mother's death,

601
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:29,232
And she came to me for treatment.

602
01:11:29,733 --> 01:11:33,236
After she got better again,
we remained friends,

603
01:11:33,236 --> 01:11:38,241
But lately she was upset about some notions
put into her head by a friend of hers.

604
01:11:38,241 --> 01:11:41,244
- Not you, I hope?
- No.

605
01:11:41,495 --> 01:11:43,997
They were kind of wild ideas.

606
01:11:43,997 --> 01:11:48,502
She had discovered that the
Tam academy was founded...

607
01:11:48,627 --> 01:11:53,131
In 1895 by a certain Helena Markos,
A Greek immigrant,

608
01:11:53,131 --> 01:11:56,635
And that the local people
believed her to be a witch.

609
01:11:58,136 --> 01:12:02,140
- I guess you knew that?
- No. But I have a strange feeling...

610
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:07,646
That somebody already told me
about it... Or something similar.

611
01:12:07,646 --> 01:12:09,648
I can't... can't remember.

612
01:12:09,648 --> 01:12:13,652
Well, that really got Sara's imagination
going. Earlier in the 19th century,

613
01:12:14,027 --> 01:12:18,532
The Markos woman had been expelled
from several european countries.

614
01:12:18,532 --> 01:12:24,037
She seemed to have something about her
which urged religious people to persecute her.

615
01:12:24,538 --> 01:12:29,042
She also wrote a number of books, and
I read that among the initiated,

616
01:12:29,543 --> 01:12:32,671
She went by the name "The Black Queen."

617
01:12:32,671 --> 01:12:36,675
After she settled down here, she became
the subject of a lot of gossip.

618
01:12:36,675 --> 01:12:40,679
Nevertheless, she managed to put
her hands on a great deal of money,

619
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:43,181
And she founded the Tam academy...

620
01:12:43,181 --> 01:12:48,311
At first a sort of school of
dance and occult sciences.

621
01:12:48,311 --> 01:12:51,314
But that didn't last long,
because in 1905,

622
01:12:51,314 --> 01:12:54,317
After being hounded and
cursed at for ten years,

623
01:12:54,317 --> 01:12:57,821
Madame Markos died in a fire.

624
01:12:57,821 --> 01:13:01,324
That's all there is, as far
as witchcraft is concerned.

625
01:13:01,324 --> 01:13:06,455
The school was taken over by her favorite
pupil. The study of the occult was abandoned.

626
01:13:06,455 --> 01:13:10,959
And soon the place became
the famous dance academy.

627
01:13:10,959 --> 01:13:15,964
But what does it mean to be a witch?

628
01:13:16,214 --> 01:13:19,593
Well, as a believer in the material
world and a psychiatrist to boot,

629
01:13:19,593 --> 01:13:24,097
I'm convinced that the current spread
of belief in magic and the occult...

630
01:13:24,097 --> 01:13:27,601
Is part of mental illness.

631
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:33,106
Bad luck isn't brought by broken
mirrors, but by broken minds.

632
01:13:34,608 --> 01:13:37,069
Excuse me. Milius?

633
01:13:37,152 --> 01:13:39,654
Professor Milius can answer your
question better than I can.

634
01:13:40,155 --> 01:13:43,158
He wrote a book called paranoia
or magic, and believe me,

635
01:13:43,158 --> 01:13:45,160
It's the final word on the subject.

636
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:49,665
Excuse me, Milius. If you don't mind,
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

637
01:13:49,665 --> 01:13:53,669
- Fraulein.
- She's interested in your favorite subject:

638
01:13:53,669 --> 01:13:56,171
Witches.

639
01:13:56,171 --> 01:13:59,675
Can you tell her something
about the mysterious?

640
01:14:01,176 --> 01:14:04,179
Well, I have to go. I have an
appointment to keep.

641
01:14:04,179 --> 01:14:06,682
Keep me posted, Hmm?

642
01:14:06,682 --> 01:14:09,184
Hello. I'm sorry to bother you.

643
01:14:09,184 --> 01:14:13,689
Ah, so, what would you like to know?

644
01:14:13,689 --> 01:14:17,192
- Do you believe in the existence of witches?
- Ah.

645
01:14:17,192 --> 01:14:21,196
I have known some women who
are said to be witches.

646
01:14:21,196 --> 01:14:24,700
- Really?
- I have studied the phenomenon for a long time.

647
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,202
I am of the opinion that
it is an important appendage...

648
01:14:27,703 --> 01:14:30,706
Of contemporary psychiatry.

649
01:14:30,706 --> 01:14:32,708
You're skeptical, my dear.

650
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:36,211
Well, frankly, it is a little
hard to believe.

651
01:14:38,213 --> 01:14:43,343
- What do witches do?
- They are malefic, negative and destructive.

652
01:14:43,343 --> 01:14:47,848
Their knowledge of the art of the occult
gives them tremendous powers.

653
01:14:48,348 --> 01:14:53,353
They can change the course of events and
people's lives, but only to do harm.

654
01:14:54,354 --> 01:14:57,858
- You don't believe me?
- No, I...

655
01:14:57,858 --> 01:15:01,361
Their goal is to accumulate
great personal wealth,

656
01:15:01,361 --> 01:15:05,365
But that can only be achieved
by injury to others.

657
01:15:05,365 --> 01:15:08,869
They can cause suffering,
sickness and even the death...

658
01:15:08,869 --> 01:15:12,873
Of those who, for whatever
reason, have offended them.

659
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:18,378
Why do you have all this
interest in the occult?

660
01:15:18,378 --> 01:15:21,381
Because some friends spoke
to me about witches.

661
01:15:21,381 --> 01:15:24,384
I read some stuff.

662
01:15:24,384 --> 01:15:27,387
Have you ever heard of Helena Markos?

663
01:15:27,888 --> 01:15:30,891
Oh, yes. She was a very
famous black queen.

664
01:15:30,891 --> 01:15:33,894
A powerful witch with a tremendous
talent for doing evil,

665
01:15:33,894 --> 01:15:35,896
A real mistress of magic.

666
01:15:36,271 --> 01:15:39,274
She lived and died in the city.
Did you know that?

667
01:15:39,775 --> 01:15:44,279
Yes. And might there exist
a guild of witches?

668
01:15:44,279 --> 01:15:47,282
The correct term would
be a coven of witches.

669
01:15:47,282 --> 01:15:50,285
A woman becomes queen of her magic
is a hundred times more powerful...

670
01:15:50,786 --> 01:15:53,288
Than the rest of the coven,
which is like a serpent.

671
01:15:53,288 --> 01:15:57,292
Its strength rests with its leader...
That is, with its head.

672
01:15:57,292 --> 01:16:01,296
A coven deprived of its leader
is like a headless cobra:

673
01:16:01,296 --> 01:16:03,799
Harmless.

674
01:16:04,299 --> 01:16:07,803
Skepticism is the natural
reaction of people nowadays,

675
01:16:07,803 --> 01:16:10,806
But magic is ever present.

676
01:16:11,306 --> 01:16:14,685
In other words:

677
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:22,192
Which means that magic is everywhere,

678
01:16:22,693 --> 01:16:25,696
And all over the world,
it's a recognized fact.

679
01:16:25,696 --> 01:16:28,865
Always.

680
01:16:42,838 --> 01:16:45,841
Mark? Mark?

681
01:16:54,349 --> 01:16:57,853
Excuse me. Where is everybody?

682
01:16:57,853 --> 01:17:02,357
They have all gone to the theater
for the opening of the Bolshoi.

683
01:17:02,357 --> 01:17:05,360
- Then why didn't anyone tell me about it?
- I don't know.

684
01:17:05,861 --> 01:17:09,364
Miss Tanner obtained
tickets for everyone.

685
01:17:13,869 --> 01:17:18,373
- Frank, this is Suzy. Sara's friend?
- Suzy? Hello?

686
01:17:18,373 --> 01:17:20,876
- I can't...
- Talk louder. I can't hear you very well.

687
01:17:20,876 --> 01:17:24,379
- Did something happen?
- Well, I haven't heard from Sara,

688
01:17:24,379 --> 01:17:27,382
But a lot of strange
things are happening.

689
01:17:27,382 --> 01:17:30,761
I mean, for example,
when I eat at night, I...

690
01:17:31,261 --> 01:17:34,014
Hello? Hello, Frank?

691
01:17:34,598 --> 01:17:37,476
Hello? Can you hear me?

692
01:17:37,476 --> 01:17:40,395
Frank? Hello?

693
01:17:40,395 --> 01:17:43,732
Hello? Hello?

694
01:17:43,732 --> 01:17:45,734
Hello?

695
01:17:47,235 --> 01:17:50,739
Hello, Frank, can you hear me?

696
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

697
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:24,333
No!

698
01:19:28,337 --> 01:19:31,340
No!

699
01:21:12,858 --> 01:21:16,361
They don't leave the school at all.

700
01:21:16,361 --> 01:21:21,325
The front door is on the left. Their
footsteps are going to the right.

701
01:21:49,353 --> 01:21:54,358
Two, three, four, five, six,

702
01:21:54,358 --> 01:21:57,319
Seven...

703
01:21:59,821 --> 01:22:04,826
I can find out where they're
going by counting their footsteps.

704
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:19,401
Twenty.

705
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:33,141
Who's there?

706
01:25:15,517 --> 01:25:19,354
Carpet. That's why the
footsteps stop here.

707
01:25:37,789 --> 01:25:41,293
It's impossible. There's gotta
be another way out of here.

708
01:26:49,903 --> 01:26:52,656
The secret...
I saw it behind the door!

709
01:26:52,656 --> 01:26:56,034
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

710
01:26:57,411 --> 01:27:00,414
The secret...
I saw it behind the door!

711
01:27:00,414 --> 01:27:03,166
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

712
01:29:54,921 --> 01:29:58,925
I told you: We must get rid of that
bitch of an american girl!

713
01:29:58,925 --> 01:30:04,306
Vanish... She must vanish! Make
her disappear, understand?

714
01:30:07,809 --> 01:30:10,812
She won't eat or drink
anything this evening.

715
01:30:17,819 --> 01:30:21,323
Vanish... She must vanish!

716
01:30:21,448 --> 01:30:24,451
She must die, die, die!

717
01:30:32,209 --> 01:30:34,711
Helena, give me power.

718
01:30:48,725 --> 01:30:51,728
Sickness! Sickness!

719
01:30:52,229 --> 01:30:54,731
Away with her! Away with trouble!

720
01:30:54,731 --> 01:30:59,736
Death, death, death!

721
01:32:59,085 --> 01:33:01,496
Who is it? Who's there?

722
01:33:03,721 --> 01:33:07,225
I've been expecting you.
The American girl.

723
01:33:07,897 --> 01:33:09,976
I knew you'd come.

724
01:33:10,988 --> 01:33:14,492
You wanna kill me?
You wanna kill me Helena Markos?

725
01:33:29,155 --> 01:33:31,531
You wanted to kill me!
You wanted to kill me!

726
01:33:33,415 --> 01:33:35,126
What are you gonna do now?

727
01:33:42,011 --> 01:33:43,757
Now death is coming for you!

728
01:33:46,731 --> 01:33:50,069
You wanted to kill Helena Markos?

729
01:33:52,954 --> 01:33:55,959
Hell is behind that door.

730
01:33:56,587 --> 01:33:59,212
You're going to meet death now!

731
01:34:00,513 --> 01:34:02,674
The living dead!

732
01:37:25,914 --> 01:37:28,917
Witch, witch.
