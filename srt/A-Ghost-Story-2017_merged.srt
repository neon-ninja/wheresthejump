2
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,290
Why are you laughing?

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,540
I am so scared.

4
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,950
- Why?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,070
Don't be scared.

6
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,100
When I was little and we used to move
all the time, I'd write these notes,

7
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,510
and I would fold them
up really small...

8
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,480
...and I would hide
them in different places,

9
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,680
so that if I ever wanted to go back,
there'd be a piece of me there waiting.

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,570
- Did you ever go back?
- No.

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,240
See? That's what I'm saying.

12
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,020
'Cause I didn't need to.

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,530
What'd they say?

14
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,320
They were just like,
old rhymes and poems.

15
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,240
Things I wanted to
remember about...

16
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,540
...living in that house
or what I liked about it.

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,170
Why did you leave?

18
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,710
Why'd you leave
all those houses?

19
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,760
'Cause I didn't have a choice.

20
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,890
Some weird noises in this house.

21
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,140
What are you doin'?

22
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,580
I was just trying to see how
heavy it was, if I could move it.

23
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,690
I just had it tuned.

24
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,200
That was like a year ago.

25
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,620
But it's still
- still in tune.

26
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,990
Should I try and find movers?

27
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,920
- For the piano?
- Yeah.

28
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,590
Mmm. Are we taking it with us?

29
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,090
She said we can if we want to.

30
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,850
Um... we can probably find
a better one if we just...

31
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

32
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,500
Is there something there?

33
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,260
What was that?

34
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,640
I don't know.

35
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,110
Maybe something
fell on the piano.

36
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,570
What time is it?

37
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,140
My heart's racing.

38
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,500
Can I have a minute?

39
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,470
- Wait.
- Yes?

40
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,820
Never mind.

41
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,350
Are you okay?

42
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,520
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

43
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,310
- I'll be just around the corner.
- Thank you.

44
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,430
No, no, it's not your fault.

45
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,850
Well, we were gonna be...

46
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,620
Are you gonna be
okay to drive home?

47
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,240
Yeah. Are you?

48
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,040
Thanks for taking me out.

49
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,070
Yeah.

50
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,620
It was fun.

51
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,210
Call me next week.

52
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
Okay.

53
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,810
Hey.

54
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,820
This shouldn't be so hard.

55
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,540
I really don't wanna talk about
this anymore tonight, okay?

56
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,380
Well,
can we talk about it tomorrow?

57
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,630
'Kay, maybe.

58
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,810
Here.

59
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:37,050
* Are you runnin' late? *
* Did you sleep too much? *

60
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,180
* All the awful dreams *
* Felt real enough *

61
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:45,180
* Is your lover there? *
* Is she wakin' up? *

62
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:49,520
* Did she die in the night? *
* And leave you alone? *

63
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:55,930
* Alone *

64
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:01,530
* Mirror, mirror *
* There's your crooked nose *

65
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,700
* What a stupid game *
* Getting nothing done *

66
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:09,460
* With your longest track *
* Your highest score *

67
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,500
* While you
crush your back *

68
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:16,550
* And lament the war *

69
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:21,250
* War *

70
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,930
* Am I runnin' late? *
* I get overwhelmed *

71
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,980
* All the awful dreams *
* All the bright screens *

72
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:34,020
* Is my lover there? *
* Are we breakin' up? *

73
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,980
* Did she find someone else?
*

74
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:41,360
* And leave me alone? *

75
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:46,940
* Alone *

76
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:54,450
Okay?

77
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,270
Carlos!

78
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,640
No, no, no, no. Si, no.

79
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,150
Okay?

80
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,810
Yasmina.

81
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,190
Mama.

82
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:31,050
* Breathe this moment like
it's gonna be my last one *

83
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,090
* Light it up, burn it down...
*

84
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,420
I don't know if you
believe in the spirit world.

85
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,380
- I do.
- You do?

86
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,760
Yeah, I totally do.

87
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:40,890
Well, then this next phenomenon
will really fascinate you.

88
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,680
I know it sounds strange,
but it does begin with,

89
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,940
"Pick a card, any card",
so pick one out.

90
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,060
And you got it?

91
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:48,260
- Burn the image into your mind.
- Yeah. Got it, got it.

92
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,180
I want you to watch
this very closely.

93
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:55,110
Because if the spirits are
with us in this haunted house...

94
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,530
...they may divine the card.

95
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,930
Holy shit.

96
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:13,750
I don't-I don't- I don't have a problem
with it if it's two people in love.

97
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,590
It's some sort of expression of,
you know, kind of...

98
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:21,180
It sounds like you don't
think women should do that.

99
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:25,520
If it's not gonna be that and it's not
gonna make us any money, then why...

100
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:27,880
And those are your
two polarities?

101
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,480
Polarities?

102
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,860
Priorities or whatever.
Money's just money.

103
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:34,360
You gotta take that out
of the equation. Now what?

104
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:36,030
Well, that's what I was saying.
It's not just...

105
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,610
No, no, you can find a reason.

106
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,780
And I wanna find out
what happens, too!

107
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:41,410
So, no money.

108
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,950
What have you got left?

109
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,370
You've got... other people.

110
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,870
You got Clara, you've got time.

111
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,080
Time's a big one.

112
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:51,910
But you've got about as much
as anyone else, give or take.

113
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,000
What about God?
Maybe you've got God.

114
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,080
Do you?

115
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:58,380
- What? Have God?
- Yes.

116
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,580
No.

117
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:01,120
Okay.

118
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,920
Well,
here's how I break it down.

119
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,560
A writer writes a novel.

120
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:08,470
A songwriter writes a song.

121
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:13,190
A symphonist writes a symphony,
which is maybe the best example

122
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:16,510
because all the best
ones were written for God.

123
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:22,200
So, tell me what happens if Beethoven's
writing his "Ninth Symphony"

124
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:26,440
and suddenly he wakes up one day
and realizes that God doesn't exist.

125
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,250
So, suddenly all of these
notes and chords and harmonies

126
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,420
that were intended to,
you know, supersede the flesh,

127
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:37,090
you realize, "Oh,
that's just physics."

128
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,590
So Beethoven says,
"Shoot, God doesn't exist,

129
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,930
so I guess I'm writing
this for other people.

130
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,640
It's just nuts and bolts now."

131
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:48,560
He didn't have any children,
that I can recall,

132
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:50,850
- but if he did...
- He had a nephew.

133
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,800
- He had a what?
- A nephew, he had a nephew.

134
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:58,360
Okay. Great.
So he-he writes it for him.

135
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,060
Or Immortal Beloved.

136
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,570
Yes.

137
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,450
Or for whoever that was.

138
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:07,790
But let's leave love out of this and
let's wrap this all up under the blanket

139
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,990
of someone thinking, "This is something
that they'll remember me for."

140
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,960
And they did. And we do.

141
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:17,670
And sure enough,
we do what we can to endure.

142
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:22,840
We build our legacy piece by piece, and
maybe the whole world will remember you,

143
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,390
or maybe just a
couple of people,

144
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:29,720
but you do what you can to make sure
you're still around after you're gone.

145
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:34,310
And so we're still
reading this book,

146
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,980
we're still singing the song,

147
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:38,770
and kids remember their
parents and their grandparents

148
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,650
and everyone's got their family tree,
and Beethoven's got his symphony,

149
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,150
and we've got it too.

150
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,490
And everyone will keep
listening to it f...

151
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,990
...for the foreseeable future.

152
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,230
But...

153
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:55,490
...that's where things start
breaking down, because your kids...

154
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,880
Do you have kids?

155
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:01,010
Wait, who here has kids?

156
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,840
You? Your kids are gonna die.

157
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:05,260
Yours too. Yours too.

158
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:07,510
Hey, just sayin'.
They're all gonna die,

159
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,850
and their kids will die,
and so on, and so on.

160
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,350
And then there's gonna be one
big-one big tectonic shift.

161
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,190
Yosemite will blow and the
Western plates will shift,

162
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,360
and the oceans will rise,
the mountains will fall,

163
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:23,360
and 90 percent of
humanity will be gone.

164
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:26,600
One fell swoop.
This is just science.

165
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:30,330
Whoever's left will...

166
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,750
...go to higher ground
and social order will fall away,

167
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:36,830
and we will revert to
scavengers and hunters

168
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,710
and gatherers,
but maybe there's someone...

169
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:45,080
...someone who one day hums
a melody they used to know.

170
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,260
And it gives everyone
a little bit of hope.

171
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,440
Mankind's on the verge
of being wiped out,

172
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:01,150
but it keeps going
a little bit longer

173
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,110
because someone hears someone
else hum a melody in a cave

174
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,650
and the physics
of it in their ear

175
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,700
make them feel something other
than fear or hunger or hate,

176
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:14,080
and mankind carries on
and civilization gets back on track.

177
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:17,320
And now you're thinking
you're gonna finish that book.

178
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,410
But it won't last.

179
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:25,120
'Cause by and by,
the planet's gonna die.

180
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:29,300
In a few billion years the
sun will become a red giant

181
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:33,040
and it'll, uh,
eventually swallow Earth whole.

182
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:35,060
This is a fact.

183
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:36,730
Now, maybe by that point,

184
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:40,480
we'll have set up shop on some
completely different planet.

185
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:42,270
Good for us.
Maybe we've figured out a way

186
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,190
of carrying with us all
these things that matter.

187
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,700
They've got a photocopy
of the Mona Lisa out there,

188
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,910
someone sees it, mixes a little
bit of alien dirt with some spit,

189
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,820
paints something new,
the whole thing keeps going.

190
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:55,450
But even that doesn't matter.

191
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,830
Because even if
some form of mankind

192
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,960
carries some recording of
Beethoven's "Ninth Symphony"

193
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:04,590
all the way into the future,
the future's gonna hit a brick wall.

194
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:07,340
The universe will
keep expanding,

195
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:10,460
and it'll eventually
take all matter with it.

196
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:17,640
Everything you've ever strived for,
everything that you and some stranger

197
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:20,600
on the other side of the planet
share with some future stranger

198
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,770
on some entirely different
planet without even knowing it,

199
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:29,110
everything that ever made
you feel big or stand up tall,

200
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:31,890
it'll all go.

201
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:35,360
Every atom in this dimension...

202
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,730
...will be pulled apart
by force as simple as...

203
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:46,120
And then all these shredded particles
will contract again...

204
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,930
...and the universe is gonna

205
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,380
suck itself back into a speck
too small for any of us to see.

206
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,220
So, you can write a book...

207
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:03,300
...but the pages will burn.

208
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,520
You can sing a song
and pass it down.

209
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:09,930
You can write a play and hope
that folks will remember it...

210
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:11,700
...keep performing it.

211
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:13,890
You can build your
dream house...

212
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:17,740
...but ultimately none
of that matters any more

213
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:22,120
than digging your fingers into
the ground to bury a fence post.

214
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:25,660
Or... or fucking.

215
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,320
Which I guess is just
about the same thing.

216
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

217
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:33,380
Thank you, O Lord,
for these, Thy blessings,

218
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:35,800
which we are about to
receive from Thy bounty.

219
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:38,120
Through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

220
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:45,460
This is good.

221
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:48,130
This is good.

222
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:54,180
We'll have this house built.

223
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:56,720
Put it right there.

224
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:59,890
There. You see it?
I know you can see it.

225
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,770
A little house at first, but...

226
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:06,860
...I'll build you a bigger one.

227
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,050
Here we are.

228
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,100
Take a look around.

229
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:27,280
We've got two, uh, bedrooms
back there with a bathroom.

230
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:28,910
The kitchen's that way.

231
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:30,810
There's a study/den.

232
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:34,950
We, uh, haven't had any
tenants in a few months...

233
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:37,320
- ...so it's a little musty.
- Does it come with the piano?

234
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:41,400
Oh, it's... always...

235
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,630
It's always been here.

236
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,220
- It's... If you want...
- Does it come?

237
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,290
It's always been here.

238
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:52,760
- I can't hear you.
- I...

239
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:54,600
Yeah, if you keep playing...

240
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:55,970
- ...you can't here me.
- I'm just kidding.

241
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,600
Uh, it's always been here.

242
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:59,140
If you want,
I can have it removed.

243
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:00,480
No.

244
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:01,810
I-I gotta take this.

245
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,230
Um, make yourself at home.

246
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:05,550
Thank you, Linda.

247
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:07,810
Hello?

248
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:09,400
Hey.

249
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:12,020
Oh, no,
I'm showing a house right now.

250
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

251
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:03,740
* Are you runnin' late? *

252
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:10,010
* Did you sleep too much? *
* All the awful dreams *

253
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:13,880
* Felt real enough *
* Is your lover there? *

254
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:17,890
* Is she wakin up? *
* Did she die in the night? *

255
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,260
* Leave you alone? *

256
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:29,110
* Alone *

257
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:33,450
* Mirror, mirror *
* There's your crooked nose *

258
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:37,490
* Boring hair *
* A dozen wrinkles *

259
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,290
- * No children *
- Come on.

260
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,200
* Just emptiness *

261
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,910
- * No place like home *
- Which is fine. I get it.

262
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,750
That's what people do. They leave, they
go away, and then they come home again.

263
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:49,000
I'm the one who's always here.

264
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:53,550
* Mess *

265
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:56,890
* 20 messages *
* Did you hurt your thumbs? *

266
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:59,930
What is it you like
about this house so much?

267
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,300
Seriously?

268
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,340
History?

269
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,100
What does that mean?

270
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:06,840
Honey, we've got history.

271
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,470
Not as much as you think.

272
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:24,820
This isn't how it's
supposed to work.

273
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:30,620
We're supposed to make
decisions together.

274
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:33,340
Can't you understand that?

275
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:34,580
Yes.

276
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,380
So why am I the only
one making them?

277
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:44,130
Because I don't
want what you want.

278
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:47,220
'Cause you want to stay here?

279
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:49,090
Mm-hmm.

280
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:51,180
Why?

281
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:51,110
Hey.

282
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:54,910
Hey.

283
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:58,330
Hey.

284
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:00,580
What?

285
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,710
It's okay. We can go.

286
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:07,920
We can go.

287
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,340
I don't understand.

288
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:49,210
Something fell on the piano.

289
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:51,970
What time is it?

290
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:27,590
