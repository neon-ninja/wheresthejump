Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

3
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,732
Are you okay?

4
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:34,491
What do you think it's
gonna be like out there?

5
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:40,996
It'll get back to normal.

6
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:42,542
You'll see.

7
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:06,566
How long
were you infected?

8
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:10,025
Four years.

9
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:11,985
Did you have to be
potty-trained again?

10
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:16,033
Are you having
any violent impulses?

11
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:17,827
No.

12
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:21,413
Any nightmares?

13
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,833
Good.

14
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:28,543
They're there to remind
you what you did.

15
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:29,629
The suffering you caused.

16
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:35,884
The nightmares mean there might
be something human left.

17
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:38,055
Makes you wonder about those
that don't have them, huh?

18
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:43,141
You'll report to me
every week.

19
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:44,935
Lateness will not
be tolerated.

20
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:46,729
Skipping work
will not be tolerated.

21
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:48,646
Anti-social behavior
will not be tolerated.

22
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:49,898
Basically you do
what I say

23
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,151
and your life will be..

24
00:03:53,153 --> 00:03:54,654
...better.

25
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:59,993
Your sister-in-law,
Abigail Reynolds

26
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:01,786
has agreed
to take you in.

27
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:04,287
I didn't put
in a request.

28
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:06,206
Charlie Three Three Bravo,
this is..

29
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,459
Not everyone gets
to go home, Senan.

30
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:10,543
You should be grateful.

31
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:12,631
Bus ready to depart. Out.

32
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,549
Close the gate.

33
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:18,301
Delta Echo One Zero.

34
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,222
Bus passes,
checkpoint four. Over.

35
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:22,515
Charlie Three Three Bravo

36
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:24,182
this is Charlie
Two One Alpha.

37
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:25,226
- The last bus is loading.
- Get on the bus quickly.

38
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:26,394
- Ready the gate. Over.
- Single file.

39
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:27,685
Take your seats.

40
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:29,355
Charlie Three Three Alpha.

41
00:04:29,357 --> 00:04:31,651
Transport departing
in two minutes. Out.

42
00:04:37,572 --> 00:04:39,240
The cure was supposed to
be some sort of great hope

43
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:40,658
but things are
just gettin' worse.

44
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,743
That's not fair.
My daughter was released.

45
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:44,662
Whatever she did she can't
hurt anyone anymore.

46
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:45,997
People need to give
them a second chance.

47
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:48,081
We've given them
every chance.

48
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,418
They're not integrating. No
wonder crime's on the rise.

49
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,085
They're not
like us anymore.

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
They would if they were
given some choices
instead of being treated like
they were still infected.
Have you seen the news?
The violence?
The vandalism? There's
something wrong with them.
They're not human.

51
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:03,471
They don't, they don't
have a worry.

52
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:04,640
They're just scum.

53
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,607
Scumbags! Murderers!

54
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:17,946
Scum! Scum! Scum!

55
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:20,488
Welcome to the
accommodation center.

56
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:23,826
For those of
you going home

57
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:25,994
please make your way
to the left.

58
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:27,996
Which is my right.

59
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:29,958
Make your way
to my right.

60
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,167
Which is your left.

61
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:33,251
Left is home.

62
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:34,671
Senan.

63
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:37,881
You're not human!

64
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:39,550
You're not human!

65
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:44,390
Don't tell her.

66
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:54,732
We need to look out for
each other out here, okay?

67
00:05:59,364 --> 00:06:02,365
Keep it moving, people.
Thank you.

68
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,034
Through that door,
please.

69
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:09,747
Don't stop. Keep going,
please. Through the door.

70
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:19,923
What are your thoughts on the
release of the Third Wave?

71
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,259
I think we can't
take any more.

72
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,094
I think the First Wave

73
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:24,427
and the Second Wave

74
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:27,805
have been
a fucking disaster.

75
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:29,432
No one wants them here.

76
00:06:29,434 --> 00:06:31,809
Not much against them.
Just... just no craic.

77
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:32,810
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

78
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:34,230
They just mope around.

79
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:35,313
Bit of a hum
off them, to be honest.

80
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:40,653
Oh, shit!

81
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:42,655
My uncle came back
in the First Wave.

82
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:44,657
And how is he now?

83
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,449
He killed himself
last year.

84
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:48,995
UN's pullin' out. Who the
fuck is gonna stay put?

85
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:50,328
They're out there,
right now.

86
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,455
Infected, Cured,
they're all the same.

87
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:54,332
Wipe the fuckin' lot of them
out, that's what I say.

88
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,169
The government now face
a very difficult dilemma

89
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:59,130
of what to do with
the 25% of infected

90
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:00,423
who remain resistant
to the cure.

91
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:02,966
I mean, what they did..
I mean..

92
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:04,677
How do you get over that?

93
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,014
Repent!

94
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:12,812
Repent!

95
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:16,147
Hop on.

96
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:18,524
Ready, activate. Go!

97
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:19,986
Whoosh!

98
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,240
Is this it? Is this
all your homework?

99
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:29,660
Hmm. Great job.

100
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:32,705
You don't even need me.

101
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:46,261
Hi.

102
00:07:54,394 --> 00:07:55,981
I don't have to stay.

103
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,111
It's what.. It's what
Luke would have wanted.

104
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,450
Besides... technically
it's your house.

105
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:13,121
It hasn't changed at all.

106
00:08:13,123 --> 00:08:15,957
I was... gonna hire

107
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,166
an interior designer,
but, um..

108
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:20,168
They all got eaten.

109
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:31,807
Sorry.

110
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:37,852
I thought that maybe if you made
it you would have gone home.

111
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:39,897
Cillian was born here.

112
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,734
And only uninfected US
nationals are considered.

113
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,907
I guess we're a risk.

114
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:52,578
Did they give you a job?

115
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:55,579
There was a..

116
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:57,497
...an opening
at the treatment center.

117
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:59,169
Why would you
wanna stay there?

118
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:05,423
It's just being
a porter again.

119
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,384
Luke always said you were
wasting your time with that.

120
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,899
Were you with him?

121
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:25,277
At the end?

122
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:30,991
We got separated.

123
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:44,172
You wanna go say hi?

124
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,845
Hey.

125
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:13,701
Are you one
of the Cured?

126
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,249
Yeah.

127
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:24,254
Will you be sick again?

128
00:10:30,592 --> 00:10:31,927
I don't think so.

129
00:10:36,432 --> 00:10:38,351
Is it nice to be back?

130
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:46,567
Yeah. It is.

131
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:13,676
Make your way to the
nearest evacuation point.

132
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:18,263
- Abbie! Abbie!
- Even if a loved one.

133
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:20,015
Make your way to the nearest
evacuation point.

134
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:20,934
Luke.

135
00:11:20,936 --> 00:11:22,019
Luke!

136
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:24,189
We have to go.

137
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:28,776
Abbie knows what to do.

138
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:40,705
No!

139
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,584
Senan!

140
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:46,584
Run!

141
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:48,043
Run!

142
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:17,907
Do you have
what it takes to join

143
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,408
the Irish Defense
Volunteers?

144
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,575
Well, call..

145
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:37,762
Hi, Dad.

146
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:44,351
They have me working
as a cleaner.

147
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:47,188
It's ridiculous.

148
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:52,525
I thought maybe..

149
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:54,361
...you could put in a good
word at some firms you know.

150
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:57,698
Get me back
in the courtroom.

151
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:01,702
Please, Dad.

152
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:03,954
Mum wouldn't want this.

153
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,832
Don't you dare
mention her.

154
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:11,712
I saw what you did to her.

155
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:14,257
You're a monster.

156
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:16,217
Dad..

157
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:58,423
This is Foxtrot
Sierra Nine Two.

158
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:00,595
There's been another
attack on a Cured. Over.

159
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:04,263
November Oscar 64

160
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:05,764
this is
Papa Golf Twenty-Two.

161
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:07,852
Perimeter is secure. Out.

162
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:24,284
Twenty-six, seven..

163
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:29,704
Sierra Two One,
UN withdrawal

164
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:31,501
commencing at
1400 hours.

165
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:42,137
You're over there.

166
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:48,328
You must be the help.

167
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:51,829
She one of the Resistant?

168
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,663
What do you think?

169
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:58,213
Do you have any
medical training?

170
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:01,546
I was a porter.

171
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:03,132
Jesus Christ!

172
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:04,049
They take away
my staff and give me

173
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:06,676
a fucking trolley pusher.

174
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:08,803
Hold her arm.

175
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:11,141
Are you here to help me or not?
Hold her fucking arm!

176
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:29,119
Good girl.

177
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:35,289
She's not attackin' me.

178
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,251
It's the same reason you
can't get chicken pox twice.

179
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:40,630
Once infected, your cells retain
a trace of the Maze virus.

180
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:44,634
She thinks
you're one of them.

181
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:51,639
- Where are the others?
- I don't have access any more.

182
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:53,559
They've allowed me to
continue caring for her.

183
00:16:56,562 --> 00:16:58,273
She's all that matters.

184
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:01,150
We have to cure her.

185
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:23,045
How could you
take one in? Huh?

186
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:24,337
Please, this
isn't the place.

187
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,548
They're murderers,
the lot of them.

188
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,839
Come on, love,
now's not the time.

189
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:27,884
Back off.

190
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:29,177
Murderers!

191
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:53,451
Can I make Senan
lunch tomorrow?

192
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:54,867
What do you
wanna make him?

193
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:56,413
If it's peanut butter
and chocolate chip..

194
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:01,294
...and I'm gonna
cut it in half.

195
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,718
Despite condemnation
from around the world

196
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,220
the Irish government
will commence

197
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:57,891
the humane elimination
of the resistant 25%.

198
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:00,183
The Taoiseach has called
it an act of mercy

199
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:02,645
insisting the hope
of refining the cure

200
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:04,232
is no longer a reality.

201
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,482
You.

202
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:07,483
- Hmm?
- You.

203
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:08,816
- He's the king.
- Gosh.

204
00:19:08,818 --> 00:19:10,861
Can't we work
together, maybe?

205
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:11,988
Okay.

206
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,074
Cool.

207
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,581
I was in prison.
This is worse.

208
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,419
We're treated
like lepers.

209
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:28,296
It's right that
they're scared, though.

210
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:29,462
I mean.. What we did..

211
00:19:29,464 --> 00:19:30,798
Why?

212
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,134
Why is it right
that they're scared?

213
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:34,635
They're not
the ones living here

214
00:19:34,637 --> 00:19:36,431
having their every
move monitored.

215
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,222
We need to march.

216
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:41,393
We need to stand up
and say..

217
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:51,444
You didn't tell her.

218
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:59,242
You were right to lie.

219
00:19:59,244 --> 00:20:02,288
They're all the same when
they know the truth.

220
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,871
They just want us
to continue

221
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:06,292
killing ourselves,
and solve the problem..

222
00:20:06,294 --> 00:20:07,628
Did you see them?

223
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:13,381
The Resistant
don't attack us.

224
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,054
They think
we're still infected.

225
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:19,724
What does that mean?

226
00:20:23,894 --> 00:20:25,730
Means we're safer
with them than the rest.

227
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:32,695
Move.

228
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:51,964
You've been
skippin' work.

229
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:56,134
I'm not a cleaner.

230
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:03,141
You know..

231
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:05,558
...I knew people
like you..

232
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,936
...before the outbreak.

233
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:10,606
They thought the world
was theirs on a platter.

234
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:12,650
Lookin' down on
the rest of us.

235
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:14,612
But here... now..

236
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:18,114
...I'm in charge.

237
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:20,576
I decide whether your life
is happy or miserable.

238
00:21:22,662 --> 00:21:24,747
You just have to
learn to obey.

239
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:31,129
- Is that it?
- No.

240
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:39,887
Stop harassing
your family.

241
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:44,515
They don't want you back.

242
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:48,476
Get the fuck back.

243
00:21:58,738 --> 00:22:00,781
It's not your world
any more.

244
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

245
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:48,248
He's awake!

246
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,641
It's just kids.

247
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:10,393
We've been through worse.

248
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:17,358
They suit you.

249
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,904
His clothes.

250
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:23,907
Where were you
last night?

251
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:25,868
I had to go see
a friend.

252
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:29,579
I have to go.

253
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:36,044
Smile, Cillian.

254
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:37,335
- We love you, ma.
- Smile!

255
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:45,011
- Hi.
- Hm.

256
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:46,679
He suits you, yeah?

257
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:47,933
- Yeah!
- Cute.

258
00:23:49,184 --> 00:23:50,641
Oh, my God, that
toy is gonna be

259
00:23:50,643 --> 00:23:52,435
the death of me.

260
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:54,727
- It's trippy, isn't it?
- It is a bit, yeah.

261
00:23:58,108 --> 00:23:59,400
Abbie. How's it going?

262
00:23:59,402 --> 00:24:00,944
Did you get my footage?

263
00:24:00,946 --> 00:24:02,445
The withdrawal's
started already

264
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:04,322
whatever talks they're
having are bullshit.

265
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:06,282
Yeah, yeah, I got it,
but look, um..

266
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:08,741
It's just not a story of
interest for us right now.

267
00:24:08,743 --> 00:24:10,661
No, it's too soon,
I'm telling you

268
00:24:10,663 --> 00:24:11,995
the country isn't ready.

269
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:13,456
The Resistant
are still alive

270
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,123
it's not safe yet.

271
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,960
Tell that to
the families here.

272
00:24:16,962 --> 00:24:18,794
Look, I... I do have
something for you to cover.

273
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:20,628
The first McDonalds
is reopening.

274
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,923
I need some coverage.

275
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:23,506
If it's beneath you,
I can..

276
00:24:23,508 --> 00:24:26,344
Despite protests,
the humane elimination

277
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:29,180
of the resistant 25%
is now under way

278
00:24:29,182 --> 00:24:30,513
with the military
estimating it will be

279
00:24:30,515 --> 00:24:32,683
completed by the end
of the week.

280
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:48,158
Abbie.

281
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,371
Sorry, I'm a friend
of Senan's.

282
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:54,872
From quarantine?

283
00:24:54,874 --> 00:24:56,001
What gave it away?

284
00:24:57,835 --> 00:25:00,088
I was working
and I just saw you.

285
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:03,590
Anyway, it's nice
to finally meet you.

286
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:09,346
Was Senan with
you last night?

287
00:25:15,103 --> 00:25:16,852
It must have been tough.

288
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:18,940
Raising a child alone
through the outbreak.

289
00:25:19,564 --> 00:25:21,064
I managed.

290
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:23,151
Of course.

291
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:25,653
I didn't mean
anything by it.

292
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:27,782
I'm sorry.
It's just force of habit.

293
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:33,244
I guess being a cleaner wasn't
your top career choice, huh?

294
00:25:33,246 --> 00:25:34,289
No.

295
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:37,498
I'm a barrister.

296
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,333
I was actually running for
election before all this.

297
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:41,503
Well, maybe you can
run again.

298
00:25:42,255 --> 00:25:43,506
No, I doubt it.

299
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,508
It's nice
to have your vote.

300
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:50,345
How did you get that?

301
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:52,845
This?

302
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:54,599
Um, I was late for work.

303
00:25:56,311 --> 00:25:59,020
You have to complain.

304
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:01,524
The guy we complain to has a
pretty decent right hook.

305
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:10,238
What was it like?

306
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,366
Quarantine?

307
00:26:13,203 --> 00:26:14,412
No, before that.

308
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:18,208
Why don't you ask Senan?

309
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:21,168
I can't.

310
00:26:25,255 --> 00:26:27,174
Everyone says it's hell.

311
00:26:30,845 --> 00:26:33,348
It's like being trapped
inside your body.

312
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:36,516
Fighting to stop yourself.

313
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:41,269
But what they
don't talk about..

314
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:42,940
...is the moment
when you stop fighting.

315
00:26:45,235 --> 00:26:47,237
When you start to
just go with it.

316
00:26:59,832 --> 00:27:02,127
Gosh, I have to
get back to work.

317
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:07,340
Thank you.

318
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:11,092
For what?

319
00:27:11,094 --> 00:27:12,762
For not treating me
like an animal.

320
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:16,932
Senan's very lucky
to have you.

321
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:51,089
Nerve degradation
remains the same.

322
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:53,384
Subject 301 shows
no sign of change.

323
00:27:53,386 --> 00:27:54,592
Recommend
upping the percentage

324
00:27:54,594 --> 00:27:56,513
of Bendamustine
in the formula.

325
00:27:58,348 --> 00:28:00,683
Sometimes I feel it.

326
00:28:00,685 --> 00:28:01,935
Screaming to get out.

327
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:03,519
The cure prevents

328
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:05,688
reinfection
or transmission.

329
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,357
You're one of
the lucky ones.

330
00:28:31,925 --> 00:28:34,132
They were never gonna
keep the Resistant alive

331
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:35,927
with the
withdrawal happening.

332
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:38,179
We have to do something
to stop them.

333
00:28:38,181 --> 00:28:40,850
- Now.
- We need to target the IDV.

334
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:53,631
Fuckin' screamers.

335
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:58,801
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

336
00:29:58,803 --> 00:30:00,805
- Prick.
- Nick, I need help here!

337
00:30:03,016 --> 00:30:04,684
- You're one of them.
- Aah!

338
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,189
Shit!

339
00:30:39,052 --> 00:30:41,221
Squadron Eight.
Perimeter clear.

340
00:30:46,935 --> 00:30:48,853
They're gonna die anyway.

341
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:11,207
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

342
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:12,916
Cured rights now!

343
00:31:18,591 --> 00:31:20,133
The truth is
that every day

344
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:21,467
that the Resistant
remain alive

345
00:31:21,469 --> 00:31:23,594
is a day that we risk
another outbreak.

346
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:26,179
But I can find a cure.

347
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:29,017
I just need time
and resources.

348
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:31,809
We have a stretched
medical system.

349
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:33,146
We have to redirect
our efforts

350
00:31:33,148 --> 00:31:34,812
back to the populace.

351
00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:36,439
You're talking
about killing

352
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:38,360
almost 5000 people.

353
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,864
Joan... I fear
your personal loss

354
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:46,659
has clouded your judgment.

355
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:49,827
But I would ask you,
and indeed all those

356
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:51,539
with loved ones
amongst the Resistant

357
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,999
do you really want them
to live

358
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:55,793
as these monsters
forever?

359
00:31:55,795 --> 00:31:57,712
They won't stop
with the Resistant.

360
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:01,551
They want us all dead.

361
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,139
We have to stop them.

362
00:32:58,648 --> 00:32:59,942
Senan. Senan.

363
00:33:02,862 --> 00:33:04,114
They're all empty targets.

364
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,367
I promise you no one
will get hurt.

365
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:01,960
- Hello.
- Hey, there's been a series of bombings.

366
00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:03,296
- How many?
- They're reporting five.

367
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:04,881
Okay. Okay, just, uh..

368
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:07,048
I have to drop off my son.
Give me 30 minutes.

369
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,385
Cillian?
Cillian, let's go.

370
00:34:12,098 --> 00:34:13,224
Senan?

371
00:34:17,103 --> 00:34:18,980
Cured en route.

372
00:34:19,772 --> 00:34:22,106
Understood.

373
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:24,150
There have been several
injured and one dead.

374
00:34:24,152 --> 00:34:27,236
The targets were the homes
of Irish Defense Volunteers.

375
00:34:27,238 --> 00:34:29,946
The Cured Alliance have claimed
responsibility for the attacks.

376
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:31,490
The government have
insisted that they are

377
00:34:31,492 --> 00:34:33,034
a terrorist
organization.

378
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:34,535
It's several weeks now
since the..

379
00:34:34,537 --> 00:34:37,621
Squadron Eight.
Perimeter clear.

380
00:34:37,623 --> 00:34:40,624
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

381
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:42,208
Calm down, will you?
Get in the car!

382
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,670
Get in the fuckin' car!
Calm down! Get in the car.

383
00:34:44,672 --> 00:34:47,631
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

384
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:51,010
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

385
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:54,388
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

386
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:57,558
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

387
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,642
Cured rights now!

388
00:35:15,078 --> 00:35:16,371
Senan.

389
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:19,207
Senan, it's me. Please.

390
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:23,586
Senan, please.

391
00:35:26,797 --> 00:35:28,049
Senan..

392
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:32,303
Senan, please!
Please, Senan!

393
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,399
No! Stop!

394
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,943
Please!

395
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:55,824
I know it's been hard
for you all

396
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:58,661
being beaten and bullied
and forgotten.

397
00:35:58,663 --> 00:36:00,496
There's no one
looking out for us

398
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:02,206
but I promise
that ends now.

399
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:04,000
Today will be
the first day

400
00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:05,877
on the road
to our freedom.

401
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,711
Whoo! Yeah!

402
00:36:07,713 --> 00:36:09,465
- Yes!
- Whoo!

403
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:40,246
You know we found
the cure together?

404
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:43,917
You can't imagine
the excitement.

405
00:36:46,252 --> 00:36:48,046
Later we realized that..

406
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:53,466
...the subject remembered

407
00:36:53,468 --> 00:36:55,428
what they did
when infected.

408
00:37:00,058 --> 00:37:01,309
Was it worth it?

409
00:37:02,978 --> 00:37:04,645
After everything
we've done?

410
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:09,109
You weren't in control,
you were just sick.

411
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,660
We cured you.

412
00:37:23,498 --> 00:37:25,166
You get to choose
who you want to be.

413
00:37:28,586 --> 00:37:30,044
Does puppy's baby
have a name?

414
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:33,047
Uh... Andrew.

415
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:34,465
- Andrew?
- Yeah.

416
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:36,175
I'm just making up..

417
00:37:36,177 --> 00:37:38,302
I'm just making up
normal names.

418
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:39,222
Mm.

419
00:37:46,854 --> 00:37:48,648
Are you involved
with the Cured Alliance?

420
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,567
No.

421
00:37:52,652 --> 00:37:54,570
So where do you go
at night?

422
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,908
I don't want to
get in your way.

423
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:17,052
There was so much chaos
after the Outbreak.

424
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,307
It was two years before we could
begin to re-enter the city.

425
00:38:27,478 --> 00:38:29,940
We started to hear
a rumor of a cure.

426
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:38,656
I actually convinced myself
that Luke was infected.

427
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,621
Just... waiting
to be rescued.

428
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:56,299
And then I came home.

429
00:39:00,678 --> 00:39:02,763
I thought they'd cleared
the entire city.

430
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:10,063
The smell hit me first.

431
00:39:16,402 --> 00:39:17,570
Luke's gone.

432
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:21,489
We're your family.

433
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:22,575
Abbie..

434
00:39:25,411 --> 00:39:26,412
Mom?

435
00:39:29,415 --> 00:39:30,708
Hey, sweetie.

436
00:39:38,091 --> 00:39:39,759
How far outside the city
can we go?

437
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:31,436
Me and your dad used to come
here when we were kids.

438
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:40,987
It's as if
nothing happened.

439
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,536
Liar, liar,
pants on fire.

440
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:52,330
- What's her name?
- What?

441
00:40:52,332 --> 00:40:54,582
What's her name?

442
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:55,749
Beatrice.

443
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:57,418
Don't get me started
on this.

444
00:40:58,546 --> 00:41:00,171
Yeah.

445
00:41:00,173 --> 00:41:01,839
Then what we doing
with them?

446
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:05,011
I'll get it.

447
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:07,511
What's that?

448
00:41:07,513 --> 00:41:09,097
We were just
having dinner.

449
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,598
I won't stay long.

450
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:15,897
Take a seat.

451
00:41:20,735 --> 00:41:22,568
Hello.

452
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,278
Hi.

453
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,072
I'm Conor.

454
00:41:26,074 --> 00:41:27,615
I'm a friend
of your uncle's.

455
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:29,077
Cillian, bedtime.

456
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:31,913
Now, please.

457
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,420
He's a good-looking boy.

458
00:41:41,422 --> 00:41:43,672
I can see
the resemblance.

459
00:41:43,674 --> 00:41:46,300
I called earlier,
but you weren't in.

460
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:48,302
Where did you go?

461
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:49,512
Killiney Hill.

462
00:41:49,514 --> 00:41:51,307
Oh. Nice.

463
00:41:52,683 --> 00:41:55,268
It's good to
see you bonding.

464
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:58,938
It must be tough at the accommodation
center after the bombing.

465
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,689
At least they
arrested someone.

466
00:42:00,691 --> 00:42:02,691
She didn't act alone.

467
00:42:02,693 --> 00:42:05,987
Well, there's a lot of
anger out there, you know?

468
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:08,656
Particularly
with the Elimination.

469
00:42:08,658 --> 00:42:10,326
Maybe it's for the best.

470
00:42:12,078 --> 00:42:14,203
Dr. Lyons will
find a cure.

471
00:42:14,205 --> 00:42:16,664
- And what if she can't?
- She needs time.

472
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,750
And one of them gets out, and...
and we're right back there.

473
00:42:19,752 --> 00:42:20,709
We're all in danger.

474
00:42:20,711 --> 00:42:22,755
Not all of us.

475
00:42:25,926 --> 00:42:29,429
It's late.
You need to go.

476
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:35,851
Can I ask you something?

477
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:40,440
Do you think
we deserve forgiveness?

478
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:44,901
Yes.

479
00:42:44,903 --> 00:42:47,072
And if you were faced with the
man that killed your husband..

480
00:42:49,324 --> 00:42:50,909
...would you forgive him?

481
00:42:57,165 --> 00:42:58,791
They weren't in control.

482
00:43:00,751 --> 00:43:01,792
I'd better check
on Cillian.

483
00:43:01,794 --> 00:43:03,419
I'm sorry.

484
00:43:03,421 --> 00:43:05,090
I didn't mean to
upset you.

485
00:43:07,758 --> 00:43:08,676
You didn't.

486
00:43:23,524 --> 00:43:25,691
She takes you in and suddenly
you forget about us?

487
00:43:25,693 --> 00:43:28,861
You told me
they were empty targets.

488
00:43:28,863 --> 00:43:32,698
There's always
casualties, Senan.

489
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,202
We're dying every day
because of them.

490
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:39,082
I'm not gonna be
a part of this anymore.

491
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:41,707
I have to look after them.

492
00:43:41,709 --> 00:43:43,042
You think you can
just shut the door

493
00:43:43,044 --> 00:43:44,921
and pretend it's all okay?

494
00:43:48,049 --> 00:43:51,219
You're the reason...
they're not safe.

495
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
They'll find out
eventually.

496
00:44:26,629 --> 00:44:28,004
Sweetheart, can you go
and brush your teeth?

497
00:44:28,006 --> 00:44:29,755
I'm gonna be late.

498
00:44:29,757 --> 00:44:31,966
Cillian, now!

499
00:44:31,968 --> 00:44:33,636
I can take him to school.

500
00:44:35,346 --> 00:44:37,513
Uh, you don't know
where it is.

501
00:44:37,515 --> 00:44:38,975
I can show him.

502
00:44:40,936 --> 00:44:42,851
Okay.

503
00:44:42,853 --> 00:44:44,940
Okay, but straight
to school, okay?

504
00:44:51,362 --> 00:44:53,196
- Aah..
- Fall off.

505
00:44:53,198 --> 00:44:54,699
I'd never fall off.

506
00:45:02,123 --> 00:45:04,334
- Aah..
- Yeah.

507
00:45:11,257 --> 00:45:14,592
I just wanted to check to make
sure that he wasn't late.

508
00:45:14,594 --> 00:45:16,928
Yes, thank you. Bye.

509
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:23,226
What's this about?

510
00:45:23,228 --> 00:45:25,436
It's customary to check in
with families

511
00:45:25,438 --> 00:45:26,356
to see
how everything's going.

512
00:45:28,399 --> 00:45:32,276
So, how is Senan
settling back in?

513
00:45:32,278 --> 00:45:34,112
Well.

514
00:45:34,114 --> 00:45:36,616
It's natural for there
to be problems at first.

515
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:39,911
Everything's fine.

516
00:45:42,122 --> 00:45:44,582
You know, I have to say..

517
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:48,918
...I think it's brave
of you

518
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,753
to take one back in.

519
00:45:50,755 --> 00:45:53,297
Especially with a young
boy in the house.

520
00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:55,508
They can be aggressive.

521
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:56,968
And it probably
doesn't help that their

522
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,596
rehab officer kicks
the shit out of them.

523
00:46:00,515 --> 00:46:03,141
You've met Conor.

524
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:04,644
The alpha of the pack.

525
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:09,772
They're friends.
From quarantine.

526
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:11,359
Is that
what they told you?

527
00:46:20,618 --> 00:46:22,368
We try to make ourselves
feel better

528
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:25,538
feel safe, by saying
it wasn't their fault.

529
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,500
They're just
mindless monsters.

530
00:46:29,377 --> 00:46:31,046
But the Infected
aren't mindless.

531
00:46:33,048 --> 00:46:34,964
They hunt together.

532
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:36,507
They communicate
with each other.

533
00:46:36,509 --> 00:46:39,010
They decide who to kill..

534
00:46:39,012 --> 00:46:40,596
...and who to infect.

535
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:46,727
They're connected in a way
that we will never understand.

536
00:46:49,064 --> 00:46:50,690
What do you want from me?

537
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,235
I want you to contact me.

538
00:46:56,362 --> 00:46:58,031
If you think there's
anything I should know.

539
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:40,798
They're killing
the Resistant

540
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,884
because they think
they're a threat.

541
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,969
But they're not
a threat to us.

542
00:48:44,971 --> 00:48:46,932
They're the key
to our freedom.

543
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:51,059
Now, we're not gonna change
anything by simply crying

544
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,477
and breaking windows
like petulant teenagers.

545
00:48:53,479 --> 00:48:55,646
We need something that
will make them listen.

546
00:48:55,648 --> 00:48:57,106
Something they're truly
scared of.

547
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:59,358
- Yes! Yes!
- This is our country too.

548
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,693
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes!

549
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:07,953
Katie.

550
00:49:24,344 --> 00:49:26,135
What are you doing here?

551
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:27,805
I wanted to see it
for myself.

552
00:49:30,058 --> 00:49:31,726
I thought you might've
come to see me.

553
00:49:37,983 --> 00:49:39,650
Do you want to
ask me something?

554
00:49:41,027 --> 00:49:43,361
You were involved
in the bombings.

555
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:45,363
You can't link me
to any violence.

556
00:49:45,365 --> 00:49:46,447
So you're denying it?

557
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:48,241
All I've done is
tried to help people.

558
00:49:48,243 --> 00:49:49,911
It's not just
for the power then?

559
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,748
Now, look at
how they treat us.

560
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:56,707
Look at how we're
forced to live

561
00:49:56,709 --> 00:49:58,376
what choice do we have?

562
00:49:58,378 --> 00:50:00,962
You have the choice
not to eat people.

563
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:02,883
Well, there's the thing.

564
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,758
We're not
the only killers.

565
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,470
We're just the ones
being reminded of it.

566
00:50:09,305 --> 00:50:11,057
I want you to stay away
from me.

567
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:14,644
And stay away from Senan.

568
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,899
Senan... is my family...

569
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:23,651
Why? Because
you killed together?

570
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,195
'Cause you're a pack?

571
00:50:26,197 --> 00:50:27,991
That's not a family,
it's a sickness.

572
00:50:30,035 --> 00:50:31,953
He wouldn't have
told you that.

573
00:50:33,371 --> 00:50:34,872
Stay away from us.

574
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:17,455
Elimination of
level one complete.

575
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:19,459
Moving all remaining Resistant
to the holding area.

576
00:51:47,403 --> 00:51:48,279
Jo?

577
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
My love?

578
00:52:10,551 --> 00:52:11,677
It's me.

579
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,071
No!

580
00:52:35,243 --> 00:52:36,244
What are you doing?

581
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:40,955
She's being brought to the
rest for euthanization.

582
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:42,292
I can save her!

583
00:52:43,626 --> 00:52:45,253
Please, no!

584
00:52:50,258 --> 00:52:52,050
- Done.
- What am I?

585
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:53,303
A dog.

586
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,805
You're gonna love this.

587
00:52:57,223 --> 00:52:58,973
I look a bit more
like a gerbil.

588
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:01,809
- No, you look like a dog.
- I look like a hamster.

589
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:02,977
- And it's all your fault.
- You look like a dog.

590
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,395
It's all your fault.

591
00:53:04,397 --> 00:53:06,105
...windows like
petulant teenagers.

592
00:53:06,107 --> 00:53:08,232
We need something that
will make them listen.

593
00:53:08,234 --> 00:53:10,151
We need to make ourselves
heard properly.

594
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,986
- Yes!
- This is our country too.

595
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:15,283
Yes!

596
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

597
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,280
- You okay?
- Yeah.

598
00:54:37,282 --> 00:54:38,491
Sorry, just on edge.

599
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,451
You look ridiculous.

600
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:44,830
Yeah.
I'll go wash it off.

601
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,009
I'm so used to doing this
on my own.

602
00:54:58,011 --> 00:55:00,136
It's so weird
having someone here.

603
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:01,014
Yeah.

604
00:55:05,894 --> 00:55:07,562
When Cillian was born,
Luke was petrified.

605
00:55:09,898 --> 00:55:12,606
Well, it wasn't
exactly planned, so..

606
00:55:12,608 --> 00:55:13,526
Hmm.

607
00:55:17,197 --> 00:55:20,698
He said it was like somebody put
his heart inside somebody else.

608
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,699
Christ.

609
00:55:22,743 --> 00:55:24,662
He could be
so pretentious.

610
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
He'd be happy
you're here.

611
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,059
Cured scum!

612
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:50,563
Luke..

613
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:00,573
Was there any
distinctive features?

614
00:56:02,825 --> 00:56:05,745
No. Just the anti-Cured
symbol.

615
00:56:07,914 --> 00:56:09,956
Did they say anythin'?

616
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:10,833
No.

617
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,335
We'll do everything
we can to catch them

618
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:17,088
but, uh,
this sort of thing

619
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:19,759
it's not uncommon
in homes with..

620
00:56:21,594 --> 00:56:22,637
Eh..

621
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:27,517
- You can say Cured.
- E... exactly. Yes.

622
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:46,494
You were right.

623
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:49,495
I can't keep them safe.

624
00:56:51,082 --> 00:56:52,375
I need your help.

625
00:56:55,086 --> 00:56:56,754
They'll never
leave us alone.

626
00:57:00,258 --> 00:57:02,093
We need something that
will make them listen.

627
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:23,988
Sergeant Cantor.

628
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:25,491
It's about Conor.

629
00:57:26,993 --> 00:57:28,661
I think he's planning
something.

630
00:57:35,668 --> 00:57:36,752
Dr. Lyons?

631
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:41,505
What's goin' on?

632
00:57:41,507 --> 00:57:43,632
I asked her to come.

633
00:57:43,634 --> 00:57:44,802
Sit down.

634
00:57:53,853 --> 00:57:54,938
They took Jo.

635
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:57,855
We're gonna save her,
Senan.

636
00:57:57,857 --> 00:57:59,523
If we have
one of the Resistant

637
00:57:59,525 --> 00:58:01,692
they'll have to
take us seriously.

638
00:58:01,694 --> 00:58:03,363
No more bombings,
no more violence.

639
00:58:08,994 --> 00:58:10,912
What about the military?

640
00:58:11,704 --> 00:58:12,914
Mm?

641
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:15,748
People could get killed.

642
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,042
It's mainly
defense volunteers left.

643
00:58:18,044 --> 00:58:19,585
Scouts have
better trainin'.

644
00:58:19,587 --> 00:58:21,047
You don't know what the
fuck you're talkin' about.

645
00:58:26,552 --> 00:58:29,929
Joan, you can't agree
with this.

646
00:58:29,931 --> 00:58:32,058
I have to save her,
Senan.

647
00:58:33,684 --> 00:58:35,935
They're the same as us.

648
00:58:35,937 --> 00:58:38,064
We can't stand by
and do nothing.

649
00:58:56,791 --> 00:58:57,999
Get off, get off!

650
00:58:58,001 --> 00:58:59,752
Run! Run, run, run, run!

651
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:03,671
Move, move, move!

652
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,173
Senan, come on!

653
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:07,633
Where are they?
Down. Get down.

654
00:59:07,635 --> 00:59:08,842
- Get down. I said stay down.
- And the rest of them.

655
00:59:08,844 --> 00:59:11,637
Get up against the wall!

656
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:12,763
Go look in the basement,
there are more in there.

657
00:59:12,765 --> 00:59:14,640
Where are they off to?
Where are they going?

658
00:59:14,642 --> 00:59:15,518
Where?

659
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,385
I told you
to stay away from us.

660
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:53,346
Senan told me
about the break-in.

661
00:59:53,348 --> 00:59:55,016
I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

662
00:59:56,267 --> 00:59:57,602
I know it was you.

663
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:04,607
You know,
for a while there

664
01:00:04,609 --> 01:00:08,736
I thought you and I,
that we had something.

665
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,949
But it turns out you're
just like everybody else.

666
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:12,617
Scared.

667
01:00:14,285 --> 01:00:16,204
And the truth is,
you're right to be scared.

668
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:22,333
No matter how much
we pretend..

669
01:00:22,335 --> 01:00:24,004
...we're not
the same people anymore.

670
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:34,139
All because daddy
wouldn't get you a job.

671
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:41,479
You know,
I met your husband once.

672
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,526
Bless him,
he tried his best.

673
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,195
You're lying.

674
01:00:51,197 --> 01:00:53,656
You should ask
Senan about him.

675
01:00:53,658 --> 01:00:55,160
It's all very
Cain and Abel.

676
01:01:18,391 --> 01:01:19,267
No!

677
01:01:21,727 --> 01:01:23,271
Senan?

678
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:31,277
Where's Conor?

679
01:01:32,863 --> 01:01:34,115
What's he planning?

680
01:01:35,783 --> 01:01:37,909
Senan?

681
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:40,580
He doesn't care
about you.

682
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:47,795
- He looked after me.
- He infected you!

683
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:53,009
You have to give me
something.

684
01:01:54,302 --> 01:01:55,969
Before it's too late.

685
01:01:55,971 --> 01:01:58,012
Before the withdrawal
is over.

686
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,514
Time's up.

687
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,522
I can help.

688
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:10,026
I can help your family.

689
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:16,116
Isn't that what
Luke would want?

690
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:28,336
Conor needs to see ya.

691
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,881
Hey.

692
01:02:33,258 --> 01:02:34,382
12 o'clock.

693
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:35,510
The baths.

694
01:02:53,444 --> 01:02:54,529
Hey.

695
01:02:58,449 --> 01:02:59,534
I'm sorry
I didn't come home.

696
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:05,123
What's wrong?

697
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:20,680
What happened to Luke?

698
01:03:30,023 --> 01:03:31,357
How did he die?

699
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:38,698
- Abbie..
- Tell me.

700
01:03:48,374 --> 01:03:50,210
I thought it would be better
if you didn't know the truth.

701
01:04:09,854 --> 01:04:10,939
What happened?

702
01:04:14,109 --> 01:04:15,610
- What good will it do?
- Tell me!

703
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,618
We were here.

704
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:29,749
We..

705
01:04:33,461 --> 01:04:35,879
Luke thought that..

706
01:04:35,881 --> 01:04:38,131
...maybe you'd been
trapped here.

707
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:40,218
But you'd already gone
by the time we got here.

708
01:04:44,472 --> 01:04:45,932
Then there was
an Infected.

709
01:04:48,143 --> 01:04:49,477
And he attacked me.

710
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:53,023
Conor.

711
01:04:56,484 --> 01:04:57,610
Yeah.

712
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,866
Luke tried
to fight him off.

713
01:05:06,827 --> 01:05:08,121
But it was too late.

714
01:05:15,003 --> 01:05:17,380
And then he barricaded
himself in the bedroom.

715
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:27,055
I wasn't in control.

716
01:05:27,057 --> 01:05:30,183
Believe me,
I... I didn't know

717
01:05:30,185 --> 01:05:31,850
what I was doing, and...

718
01:05:31,852 --> 01:05:33,729
How could you not tell me?

719
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:38,274
How could you sleep here?

720
01:05:38,276 --> 01:05:40,776
- I'm so sorry...
- Get out!

721
01:05:40,778 --> 01:05:42,530
Get the fuck out!

722
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:44,613
Get the fuck out!

723
01:06:41,131 --> 01:06:42,382
I had to show you.

724
01:06:45,051 --> 01:06:46,887
They're all the same
when they know the truth.

725
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,557
I'm your real family,
Senan.

726
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:59,730
You never had
any nightmares, did you?

727
01:06:59,732 --> 01:07:00,816
Why should I?

728
01:07:01,902 --> 01:07:03,317
This is Sergeant Cantor.

729
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:05,153
I need back-up
at the baths.

730
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,365
On your knees,
hands on your head.

731
01:07:09,367 --> 01:07:11,784
Understood.
We're on our way.

732
01:07:11,786 --> 01:07:13,454
We will be
with you shortly.

733
01:07:17,959 --> 01:07:19,085
Get down.

734
01:07:20,378 --> 01:07:21,462
Now.

735
01:07:35,643 --> 01:07:37,643
I'm arresting you
for the murder

736
01:07:37,645 --> 01:07:39,314
of Cadet Jack Dermody.

737
01:07:41,649 --> 01:07:42,984
I did tell you, Conor.

738
01:07:44,903 --> 01:07:46,947
It's not your world
any more.

739
01:07:51,159 --> 01:07:52,285
Cuff yourself.

740
01:08:01,669 --> 01:08:02,877
Conor!

741
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:06,630
Conor! Stop! Stop!

742
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:26,569
Why?

743
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:29,737
Why?

744
01:08:35,327 --> 01:08:36,995
I can't let you
go through with it.

745
01:08:38,956 --> 01:08:40,248
People will get hurt.

746
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:43,042
I told you..

747
01:08:43,044 --> 01:08:45,296
...there's always
casualties.

748
01:08:47,798 --> 01:08:49,130
What're you planning?

749
01:08:49,132 --> 01:08:50,799
Conor.

750
01:08:50,801 --> 01:08:52,758
What're you
really planning?

751
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,635
It's already done.

752
01:09:23,709 --> 01:09:25,628
The Cured on route.

753
01:09:26,712 --> 01:09:28,212
Understood.

754
01:09:28,214 --> 01:09:29,340
Copy that.

755
01:10:05,251 --> 01:10:06,920
Where's the control room?

756
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:14,467
Come on.

757
01:11:01,473 --> 01:11:02,557
There she is.

758
01:11:12,027 --> 01:11:13,485
Come on, hurry up,
will you?

759
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:25,747
What are you doing?

760
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:31,501
This isn't the plan,
please.

761
01:11:31,503 --> 01:11:32,587
Yes, it is.

762
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:40,680
- Look, this is madness.
- I told you to shut up.

763
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:56,487
Oh, God!

764
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

765
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
They're through,
they're through.
They're pouring through!

766
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

767
01:13:57,317 --> 01:13:59,192
The fence is down!
The fence is down!

768
01:13:59,194 --> 01:14:00,650
The perimeter
has been breached!

769
01:14:00,652 --> 01:14:02,737
The fence is down. I need
some back-up over here!

770
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:40,276
Welcome home, my love.

771
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

772
01:15:08,513 --> 01:15:10,265
No! No!

773
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

774
01:16:03,443 --> 01:16:04,945
Get in. Get in.

775
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:10,114
- Okay, everyone..
- Get on the truck.

776
01:16:10,116 --> 01:16:11,406
Start making your way
onto the truck. Go.

777
01:16:11,408 --> 01:16:12,616
What's going on
with the schools?

778
01:16:12,618 --> 01:16:13,826
The schools
are being evacuated.

779
01:16:13,828 --> 01:16:15,244
No, no, I have to get
to my son. Please.

780
01:16:15,246 --> 01:16:16,745
All the kids
will be at the stadium.

781
01:16:16,747 --> 01:16:18,288
- I have to get to my son...
- Ma'am, you need..

782
01:16:23,463 --> 01:16:25,754
Get on the truck!
We've got to move!

783
01:16:25,756 --> 01:16:26,922
Get on the truck now!
Get on, quick!

784
01:16:26,924 --> 01:16:28,800
I've got to find my son!

785
01:16:30,511 --> 01:16:32,013
Get Cillian!

786
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,139
Get Cillian!

787
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:35,766
Get out!

788
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

789
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

790
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:28,943
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Let's go, let's go!

791
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:29,777
Let's go, come on!

792
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:35,615
Cillian!

793
01:17:37,578 --> 01:17:38,953
Cillian!

794
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:44,626
Senan!

795
01:17:46,421 --> 01:17:48,087
- Senan!
- Hey, hey.

796
01:17:48,089 --> 01:17:49,132
Come here. Come here.

797
01:17:51,092 --> 01:17:53,176
Come on, I've got you.
I've got you.

798
01:17:53,178 --> 01:17:54,928
I've got you, come on.

799
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:56,347
It's okay. It's okay.

800
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:00,683
Please keep calm.

801
01:18:00,685 --> 01:18:02,767
If you are cured,
stay outside

802
01:18:02,769 --> 01:18:04,019
the perimeter fence.

803
01:18:04,021 --> 01:18:05,980
You are safe.
There is no room...

804
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:07,606
Please let me in. How
do you know we're safe?

805
01:18:09,194 --> 01:18:10,318
Have the schools come yet?

806
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,694
Walk through.

807
01:19:00,245 --> 01:19:01,952
He's just a boy.

808
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:04,914
Run!

809
01:19:20,015 --> 01:19:21,139
Did you really think
you could betray me

810
01:19:21,141 --> 01:19:22,265
like that?

811
01:19:24,019 --> 01:19:25,350
Did you?

812
01:19:33,528 --> 01:19:34,859
Check your right.
Move, move, move.

813
01:19:34,861 --> 01:19:36,363
Let's go!
Get out! Come on!

814
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:39,364
I was the only one
who really cared

815
01:19:39,366 --> 01:19:40,991
about you.

816
01:19:40,993 --> 01:19:43,953
I took care of you.

817
01:20:43,598 --> 01:20:44,640
Senan!

818
01:21:06,954 --> 01:21:08,871
Hey.

819
01:21:08,873 --> 01:21:09,957
You okay?

820
01:21:20,467 --> 01:21:21,551
Check the east side.

821
01:21:23,638 --> 01:21:25,891
Kill on sight.
Containment is priority.

822
01:21:28,059 --> 01:21:29,224
Guard down!

823
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:35,275
Clear!

824
01:21:42,073 --> 01:21:44,698
Listen, there's
nothing wrong with her.

825
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:47,035
- Look at her..
- He's my husband, he's..

826
01:21:47,037 --> 01:21:48,577
You can't treat
people like this.

827
01:21:48,579 --> 01:21:49,954
Why are they being
separated?

828
01:21:53,584 --> 01:21:55,625
Just let her through!

829
01:21:55,627 --> 01:21:57,295
I'm not infected.

830
01:21:57,297 --> 01:21:59,422
Why are they separated?
Why are they separated?

831
01:21:59,424 --> 01:22:00,466
Get out of my way!

832
01:22:02,552 --> 01:22:03,801
You have no right
to separate them

833
01:22:03,803 --> 01:22:04,885
they're not infected.

834
01:22:04,887 --> 01:22:06,138
Madam, calm down.

835
01:22:07,807 --> 01:22:09,432
Now everybody
needs to calm down!

836
01:22:12,812 --> 01:22:14,103
Come on, come on. Move.

837
01:22:14,105 --> 01:22:15,563
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it!

838
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

839
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:28,737
Cillian?

840
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:33,828
Cillian?

841
01:24:35,287 --> 01:24:36,121
Cillian.

842
01:25:03,315 --> 01:25:04,484
Mum!

843
01:25:06,486 --> 01:25:08,318
Oh, my.. Oh!

844
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I love you!
Oh!

845
01:25:41,353 --> 01:25:43,023
You're gonna be okay.

846
01:25:46,151 --> 01:25:47,732
You're gonna be okay.

847
01:25:51,907 --> 01:25:53,072
I love you!

848
01:25:53,074 --> 01:25:54,200
Abbie.

849
01:26:01,582 --> 01:26:02,918
I love you.

850
01:26:03,584 --> 01:26:05,336
Stop! It's okay.

851
01:26:07,547 --> 01:26:08,922
There's a cure.

852
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:12,550
He doesn't have to be
like me.

853
01:26:15,555 --> 01:26:16,932
Lyons found a cure.

854
01:26:19,559 --> 01:26:20,810
I can save him.

855
01:26:26,899 --> 01:26:27,982
Abbie.

856
01:26:35,325 --> 01:26:36,408
I love you.

857
01:26:38,328 --> 01:26:39,953
I love you.

858
01:26:39,955 --> 01:26:41,620
I love you, little..

859
01:26:41,622 --> 01:26:43,622
I love you. No..

860
01:26:45,251 --> 01:26:46,625
He's gonna be okay,
I promise.

861
01:26:46,627 --> 01:26:47,667
I promise.

862
01:27:27,252 --> 01:27:28,751
Following the recent
outbreak of the Maze

863
01:27:28,753 --> 01:27:30,710
virus in Ireland,
the country is beginning

864
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:32,881
to regain control
once again.

865
01:27:32,883 --> 01:27:34,339
People are desperately
trying to track down

866
01:27:34,341 --> 01:27:36,466
loved ones, suspected
to be amongst the 8000

867
01:27:36,468 --> 01:27:37,968
newly Infected cases..

868
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:40,429
Outcry against the humane
elimination is growing

869
01:27:40,431 --> 01:27:42,222
with families joining
the Cured Alliance who

870
01:27:42,224 --> 01:27:43,807
are leading the protests
against the government.

871
01:27:43,809 --> 01:27:45,059
The government
have agreed that

872
01:27:45,061 --> 01:27:46,476
continuing
the humane elimination

873
01:27:46,478 --> 01:27:48,312
is the only option
available

874
01:27:48,314 --> 01:27:49,479
if we are going to
stamp out this infection

875
01:27:49,481 --> 01:27:50,814
once and for all.

876
01:27:50,816 --> 01:27:52,316
..the government
are preparing to declare

877
01:27:52,318 --> 01:27:53,819
Ireland Infection free.

878
01:27:57,782 --> 01:27:59,323
We've obtained evidence
that a cure

879
01:27:59,325 --> 01:28:00,658
for the resistant strain
was perfected

880
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,826
by Doctor Joan Lyons.

881
01:28:02,828 --> 01:28:04,453
Now, either
the government knew this

882
01:28:04,455 --> 01:28:06,414
and covered it up,
or they rushed

883
01:28:06,416 --> 01:28:07,665
into the
clean-up missions

884
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:09,458
without considering
any options.

885
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,169
The people of Ireland
deserve better

886
01:28:11,171 --> 01:28:12,420
they deserve
true leadership

887
01:28:12,422 --> 01:28:14,254
that is there
for the many and not...

888
01:28:14,256 --> 01:28:15,339
Sorry, we have
to interrupt here.

889
01:28:15,341 --> 01:28:17,591
We're receiving
breaking news.

890
01:28:17,593 --> 01:28:19,509
Despite reports,
camera traps

891
01:28:19,511 --> 01:28:21,720
have discovered pockets
of Infected still

892
01:28:21,722 --> 01:28:23,138
remaining in the west
of the country.

893
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:25,640
The footage shows
at least 20 infected

894
01:28:25,642 --> 01:28:26,809
but the exact figures
have yet

895
01:28:26,811 --> 01:28:28,227
to be determined.

896
01:28:28,229 --> 01:28:30,188
The government has just
released a statement

897
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:32,481
assuring those in
the area that a military

898
01:28:32,483 --> 01:28:34,067
platoon will be
dispatched

899
01:28:34,069 --> 01:28:35,693
to evacuate them.

900
01:28:35,695 --> 01:28:36,902
Now this begs
the question

901
01:28:36,904 --> 01:28:39,238
if the military failed
to detect these Infected

902
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,823
