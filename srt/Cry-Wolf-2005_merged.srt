Hi.

20
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,700
Where is everyone?
In the assembly.

21
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,800
So why aren't you?
Why aren't you?

22
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm a transfer,
I just got here.
I know.

23
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,300
Is it that obvious?
It's a small school.

Word travels fast.

25
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,600
So what's the assembly for?
Major drama.

26

Some townie
was screwing the wrong guy
and she's gone missing.

27

she's a Dickens scholar.

33
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,800
And your dad?
Let's just say
he's not a scholar.

34
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,100
So where'd you come from?
England.

35
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,800
I meant
what was your last school?
Bradford.

36
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,000
Before that, Collegiate.
Webster before that.

37
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,700
So what'd you do?

38
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,700
I was dating this girl
who happened to be
the dears daughter.

39
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,900
Miss Allen.
Miss McNally.

40
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
Since you seem
to have skipped the assembly,
perhaps detention...

41

I'm sorry,
Miss McNally, is it?

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
if she could show me
the way to my dorm.

45
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,100
Not that I would ever set foot
in the boys' dorm.

46
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,700
No, just to the dorm's
front entrance.

47
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,300
Fine, but as soon
as you finish
showing Mr. Matthews around...

48

[door opening]
Make sure you contact
your RA and he'll help you...

I'll do just that.

51
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,500

though it would have been nice
to have seen you
before I left.

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,100
I got a great
work-study shift...

as a teaching assistant
in the Physics Department.

65
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,500

The wolf.

is a sheep.

If you can find the wolf...

110
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,600
and convince
the rest of the group
to vote him out...

111
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,800
then the money is yours.

112

the cash is theirs.

113
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,200
So how do we find the wolf?
Figure out who's lying.

I'm going to miss
the PT ragtop...

I thought that I heard
Tom move when Dodger...

119
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,300
was walking around
to mark the wolf.

120
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,300
All right, Randall,
that an official accusation?

121
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,700
And if it is?

122
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,100
Then you can only send home
the accused or the accuser...

123
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,700
but you can't win
if you don't play.

So let's vote.
That's right.

125
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,700
And the defense?
No, I'm not the wolf.

I'm not the wolf.

are you gonna listen to me...

to this chump here...

you're Tom's new bunk-buddy...

doesn't mean
you got to be his bitch.

142
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,800
You don't really think
the angry homophobe thing...

143
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,500

Come on, Randall,
you know the rules.

146
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,100
Show the group
if you've got the mark.

No mark.

I guess
Randall's not the wolf.

151

pretty boy.

Poor baby.

159
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,100
The wolf has survived.
Who wants to start round two?

160
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,200
Dodger felt up
the new guy.

161
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,300

to bring him here.

I'm allowed a defense.

they normally have a tell.

convince yourself.

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,000
You would've noticed it
if you didn't know
each other so well.

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,800
Are we voting or what?

176
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,500
One vote for Owen.
And the accuser?

177
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,200
The new guy gets to stay
and I have to go?

178
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,300
I cannot wait
to go to college.

179
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,000
Bare it and share it,
Graham.

180
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,400
Have fun
with your new recruit.

181
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,300
He's just pissed
'cause he's fat.
I can still hear you!

[All laughing]

183
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,900
So was he the wolf?
(Dodger)
Money's still on the floor.

184
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,300
Who wants to start
round three?

185
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,900
All right, this is it.
It's one vote for Owen.

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,100
Who's it going to be, Lewis?

187
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,900
[Chuckling]
Say good night, Mercedes.

188
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,100
Congratulations, baby.

189
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,600
Tonight, you could've
gotten laid. But instead...

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,200
[unzipping]

191
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,500
You got fucked.

192
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,300
Not bad
for your first day.

193
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,100
Yeah, I guess it's one way
to pay for college.

194
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,100
You think
you're that good?

195
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,600
No, it's just bored rich kids
make it so easy.

196
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,000
They're like
bickering siblings.

197
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,500
They turn on each other
for no good reason.

198
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,100
Graham's tell, come on.

199
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,900
You're awfully quick
to judge.
No, it's just that...

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,800

are my friends.

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Is this journalism class?

206
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,000
Are you Owen Matthews?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was...

207
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,700
Sleeping in.
No, my alarm clock...

208
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,200
Relax, Owen.

209
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,900
If being late
is the worst thing...

210
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,300
that happens to you
in the first week,
you got off lucky.

211
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,100
Take a seat.
As I was saying...

212
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,400
does a reporter
just go for the story?

213
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,700
Or can we, as the media,
cover a tragedy like this...

214
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,700
with both sensitivity
and respect?

215
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,700
Morning, Randall.
Laura?

216
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,400
What does that mean?

217
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,200
That means, if I may...

218
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,100
that if you upon some
nasty pictures of the victim
on the Internet...

219
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,000
don't forward them
to the whole school.

220
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,300
A resounding no to sensitivity
and respect from Mr. Hodge.

Mr. Matthews...

225
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,000
you're making it very hard
for me to pretend
that I can't tell...

226
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,200
you're not paying attention.

227
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm going to need
these articles by this Friday,
at the latest.

228
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,100
Now if any of you
are having a hard time...

to write about other than...

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,300
the most recent development
in this local tragedy...

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,200

to meet with you privately.

And they only just found
that girl this morning...

233
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,100
because her body was dragged
through the woods by a wolf.

234
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah. Listen, the guy
blew her head off...

235
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,700
then let the wildlife
just go to town.

236
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,200
Why does it have to be
a guy?

237
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,700
Please.
Serial killers
are always men.

238

that get caught, baby.

more than one, jackass.

your SAT book to my lake house
this weekend, are you?

The senator.

to take us all...

Yeah, sure.

I'm not going to be able
to make it, I got plans.

What?
By plans you mean

I mean I'm going...

249

to State tomorrow
to see the sweet Jenny Ryder.

It's Wednesday.
I know.

00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah, man.

257
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,500
Yeah, just, you know,
leave the keys
on the tire and...

258
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,300
don't get any blood
on the back seat.

259
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,600
I wouldn't dream of it.

260
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,000

to be special, you know.

of the woods,
up against a tree.

if that's your technique...

I weep for Jenny Ryder.
I bet you do.

267
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,000
So are we going
to play the game
before the weekend?

268
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,800
Not sure I want to.

269
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,200
Well, what else
are we going to do
around here, study?

270
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,500
Owen had a decent point
last night.

271
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,300
About us knowing each other
too well.

272
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,700
It's so incestuous.

273
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,700
So you just want to stop?
Because of the new guy.

274
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Thank you.
Not necessarily.

275
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,500
Well then, what?

276
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,500
We'll play
with the whole school.

277
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,000
They're the sheep,
and we're the wolves.

278
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't think they'll all fit
in the chapel.

279
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,200
(Dodger)
Let me ask you a question.

280
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,100
What's the best way
to play the game?

281
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,600
Lie your ass off.
Defend your honor.

282
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,000
Accuse your neighbor.

283
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,900
Exactly.

284
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,600
Nobody knows
who killed that girl.

285
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,500
So why don't we
make an accusation?
So what are you suggesting?

286
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,200
Let's convince them
the murderer is on campus.

287
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,500
And he's just getting
started.

288
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,100
All right.

289
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,600
But how do we do that?

290
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,300
[Tom tittering]

291
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,800
You guys
have no imagination.

292
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,700
It's like
you're playing checkers.

293
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,900
And I'm playing chess.

294
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,300
I had fun last night,
thanks for the invite.

295
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,300
Who said I invited you?
I thought Tom said.

296
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Relax, I'm kidding.

297
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,900
I wanted to apologize, too.

298
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,800
I didn't mean to piss
on you guys with that bit
about the tells.

299
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,200
Sure, you were just trying
to impress me.

300
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,900
What makes you say that?

301
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,400
Well, I just...
Relax, I'm kidding.

302
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,100
So, I had an idea
on how to convince
the rest of the school...

303
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,000
there's a murderer on campus.

304
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,500
I'm listening.

305
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,300
What if this
isn't a random murder,
but a serial killer.

306
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,700
You already lost me.

307
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,400
Let's just say
someone forwarded us
an e-mail.

308
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,300
About not one,
but a series of murders
that happened before.

309
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,400
Go on.

310
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,900
And the first victim died
in identical fashion
to our townie.

311
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
So it's happening again.

312
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,400
Why else would the police
be investigating Westlake?

313
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,200
They're not.
Telling the student body.

314
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,000
It would be our duty
to warn them.

315
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,200
Meet me in the library.

316
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
We're going to create
a killer.

317
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,300
(Dodger)
He needs a name.

318
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,000
The Wolf?
That works.

319
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,800
Okay. What else does every
good mass murderer have?

320
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,900
Something that he wears.

321
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,100
Something
that covers his face
but anyone can buy.

322
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,000
Pantyhose?
What? Is he robbing a bank?

323
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,800
My old roommate,
he used to go hunting.

324
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,700
He had one of those
neon ski masks.

325
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,800
Orange doesn't exactly
inspire fear.

326
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,000
Come on, it's the new black.
Okay.

327
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
There are plenty of
deer hunters around here.

328
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,100
Give him a camo jacket, too.

329
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,500
What's his weapon
of choice?

330
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,800
Well, the girl was shot.

331
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,200
Yeah, but a knife
would be scarier.

332
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Don't get me wrong,
I love
the phallic imagery...

333
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
but serial killers
rarely change their M.O.

334
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,000
But don't you see?
This is his pattern.

335
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Remember this is not
the first time
our boy has struck.

336
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,300
Of course, he goes
from campus to campus.

337
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,000
Following the exact
same plan.

338
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,000
The first death
is always a townie.
Which is just a warning shot.

339
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,300
Before he attacks
the school.

340
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,000
And the massacre begins.
On the full moon.

341
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,900
That's this weekend, right?
It's Halloween.

342
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,500
It's so obvious.
It's perfect.

343
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,300
So who were
the original victims?

344
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,700
So the first person killed
was obviously the town slut...

345
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,200
shot in the face
while lost in the woods.

346
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,500
Okay. Who's next?

347
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,100
What if the Wolf
waited for his prey
in the back seat of a car?

348
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,900
(Randall)
What if you were
any more cliche?

349
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
Like you can do better.

350
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,300
Dark hair, brown eyes.

351
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,700
Killed while
looking in the mirror.

352
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,000
A victim of
her own narcissism.

353
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,700
That means conceited.
Anyone else?

354
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,400
Self-mutilating de-virginizer,
eviscerated in the chapel.

355
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,600
No, it should be special
for him.

356
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,500
Lock up the misogynist pig
and let him bleed to death.

357
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,000
Right after castrating him.

358
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,900
Very slowly.

359
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Can the Wolf do
microscopic surgery?

You're next.

trying to play
the big balcony scene...

364

ripped out.

366
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,200
Who else?
Let's not forget
the campus queen.

367
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,300
Her sharp wit was dulled
when she choked...

368
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,900
on her own severed tongue.

You people
are deeply unwell.

371
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,100
Four years in the same place
with the same people.

372
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,900
What do you expect?

373
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,200
(Randall)
Last but not least.

374
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,000
The good guy that fell
for the bad girl.

375
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,300
Died of a broken heart.

376
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,000
I didn't know you were
such a romantic, Randall.

377
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm not.
But I do love the irony.

378

leaving plenty of time...

379

Yeah, that hasn't happened
since we hooked up, huh?

383

By hooking up,
you mean jerking off...

384
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,800
to my yearbook photo, right?

385
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,000
Dude, don't you want
to use an anonymous account?

386
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Why? I'm just
forwarding it along.
With sensitivity and respect.

387
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,700
Owen, Tom,
I said lights out!

388
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,400

will believe it?

I'm telling you,
I read the e-mail.
It's happening.

393
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,400
Just like it did
at that other school.

394
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,600
The first girl,
she was shot
in the face.

395

I forwarded it"..."
(boy)
To my brother.

396

He sent it to everyone
he knows.

397
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,400
He told me to get off-campus
this weekend
if I didn't wanna get gutted.

398

He said the second girl"..."

I want to see.

You got a minute?
Sure.

Antique chess set.

Got to love eBay.
Just now
discovering the Internet?

405

(Rich)
So I read your e-mail.

406
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,600
Someone forwarded that to you?
Sure did.

407
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,300
Someone also sent it
to the victim's mother.

408
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,300
Who forwarded it
to her attorney.

409
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,600
He called
the Headmaster's office
this morning.

410
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,300
She assumes it originated
off-campus. Don't worry.

411
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,400
I'm not inclined
to inform her otherwise.

412
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,100
Why would I worry?

413
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,500
I glanced at your records
this afternoon.

414
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,500
I see your father
pulled some strings
to get you in here.

415
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Dear old dad.

416
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,800
I also saw that your status
here is probationary.

417
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,000
So you end up
in the Headmaster's office...

418
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,400
you might as well
pack your bags.

Don't you mean
the confidence?

425
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,100
Actually,
I meant the ignorance.

426
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,100
You know, it was just for fun.

427
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,100
Yeah, I do.

428
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,200
But you've got to know
it had some real consequences.

No offense, Mr. Walker.

an earring...

861
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,600
that looked
like Randall's tongue stud.

862
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,400
She figured it'd be
a good setup for the car.

863
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,400
You smashed my laptop?

864
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,100
I got a little carried away.

865
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,300
I was in character.
In"..."

866
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,000
Dude! If I would have known
what you and the Vocab Ho
were up to...

867
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,500
I would have
gone after you guys...

868
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,700
instead of Owen
in the dining hall.

869
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,400
Jesus, why do you make it
so easy for us to hate you
sometimes?

870
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,100
Same reason your girlfriend
makes it so easy.

871
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,400
Who sent the IM's
from the Wolf?

872
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,800
It's not us, man,
it's got to be Randall,
all right.

873
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,700
If Randall was behind this,
don't you think...

874
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,400
he would have shown up by now
to gloat?

875
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,300
Are you sure
he got on that bus?

876
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,200
I told you, I wasrt with him.
Merce took him
to the bus station.

877
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,700
Then call her.

878
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,700
[Sighs]

879
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,700
Jesus, for what I paid
for this thing...

880
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,900
you'd think I get better
than one bar of service.

881
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,000
Wait a second.

882
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,600
How do we know
Owers telling us the truth?

883
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,200
Excuse me?

884
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,700
I mean...

885
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,200
he could be making
this whole thing up.

886
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,500
To get back at us
for the other stuff.

887
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,400
Why would I do that?

888
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,000
I'm the one
they're about to expel.

889
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,900
Exactly.

890
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,000
[Laughs]

891
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,300
This is it.

892
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,000
This is the new game.

893
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,100
Owen knows
he's going to take the fall.

894
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,700
Brought us all here
to confess.

895
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,000
Surprise, surprise.
You all fell for it.

896
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,500
Victims of your own lies.

897
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,300
Is that what you're going to
tell Mr. Walker?

898
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,800
I saw you two.

899
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,000
In his office.

900
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,200
Is that why you've been
such a prick?

901
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,000
You're the one
who's screwing a teacher.

902
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,500
I was.

903
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,800
It's over.

904
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,500
After the library...

905
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,600
I went to Rich's office
to end it.

906
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,800
But I saw you...

907
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,400
you kissed him back.

908
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,000
What else could I do?

909
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,400
He tried a lot more
before I pushed him off.

910
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,300
Then he told me
I was too mature
for guys my own age.

911
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,900
He did what?

912
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,300
I guess he was right.

913
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,600
I don't believe it.

914
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,300
I do.

915
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,800
You should really get
some sleep, baby.

916
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm all congested
from crying.
I think I'm going to
take a shower.
The steam might help.

917
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,900
(Lewis)
Did your RA take off?

918
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,300
The whole dorm's empty
except for the incarcerated.

919
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,500
You okay?

920
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,200
Yeah, just...

921
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,100
still a little spooked.

922
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,100
So what are you guys
talking about?

923
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,000
We're just trying
to figure out
who the wanna-be-Wolf is.

924
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,300
Well, who is it?
They think it's Randall.

925
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,300
I told them you dropped
him off at the bus station.

926
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,700
I didn't.

927
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,700
Not really.

928
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,600
I left him in town.
He said had some time to kill.

929
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,100
It was, like, an hour
till the next bus.

930
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,000
He probably just needed
to go buy condoms.

931
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
You taking your clothes off?

932
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,100
Yes.

933
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,100
Tell me about it.

934
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,800
I'm in my underwear.

I'm wearing your favorites.

938
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,100
Take a picture.

939
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,300
Are you kidding?

940
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,300

it's like Phone Sex 2.0.

Dude, it was
just another joke.

He probably wasrt
even on the phone with her.

958
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,000
It was the guy
that shot the girl.

959

Are you listening
to yourself?

960

The first murder happened
in a bathroom, remember?

being attacked. Please send
the police right away.

of the practical jokes.

Wait, where are you going?
I'm going back to my dorm.

969
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,300

maybe we should just take off.

No, we're not taking off!

Just get here, okay.
I can see you in the window.

1037

I can't see you.

That's why
you stood up for me...

You wanted me here for this!

No, listen to me.
Don't lie to me.

1079
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,600
Your friends are probably
just screwing with you.
Give me the gun.

1080
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:56,000
Is this the gun that killed
that girl in the woods?

Becky?

1082
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,800

We decided to
work together tonight.

We were trying to scare
Owen and Mercedes...

1101
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,600

in trouble before.

Listen, we didn't think that
anything was going to happen.

How could you let Graham
do that to me?

about it
till I left the chapel.

[Sobbing]

1106
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,200
Dodger wasrt supposed
to hit me that hard.

1107
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,400
Why did you hide
when Mr. Walker showed up?

1108
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,800
Why didn't you
say something?

1109

My attorney tells me
the news is good.

1113

They're going to drop
the charges. Self-defense.

1114
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:55,100
It'll be a few years
probation, if that.

Dad...

1116
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,600
how's that possible?

1117
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,600
They ran ballistics
on the handgun. It turned out
to be the weapon...

1118
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:06,400
the police were looking for
in the shooting
of that local girl.

1119
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:07,700
Really?

1120
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,600
It appears you shot
a wanted murderer.

1121

How do they know
it was him?

1122
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,300
It seems he was involved
with the victim at some point.

1123
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,900
They checked
his credit card bill...

1124
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:25,000
and found out that he'd
purchased two airline tickets
last month.

1125
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:28,100
One in his name,
the other in the girl's.

1126
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,500
Do they know
why he killed her?

1127
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,800
My attorney says
they're calling it
a crime of passion.

1128

the truth with these things.

is here to see him.

You have to believe me.
It's okay.

1142
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,300
I wish I could
make it up to you.
I know.

1143
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,900
If I had known Rich
was involved with that girl...

1144
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,700
I wouldn't have played
this stupid joke.

1145
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,900
What did you say?

1146
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,300
If I had known Rich
was screwing that girl...

1147

the others into this.

I don't understand.

1151
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,600
You wouldn't play some game...

1152
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,000
if you knew
Rich was cheating on you.

1153
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:33,800
That's what I just said.

1154
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,700
You would get him back.

1155
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:42,600
Owen, I'm confused.
I don't...

1156

No, you're not.

1157

That's what
you want me to believe.

1164
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,300
You said you had ended it
with Rich.

1165
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:13,700
I don't think
that's what happened.

1166
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:18,100
I think you were still
in love with him.

1167
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,000
I think you knew that girl.

1168
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,100
This is my home.

1169
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,300

still sleeping with Rich.

Well, the girl was shot.

1174

I should go do.

1176
